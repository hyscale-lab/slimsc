Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. A number n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met: first, when you write n in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

Let me try to break this down. 

First, since n has exactly two digits in base b, that means n can be expressed as a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. So, a must be between 1 and b-1 (since it's the leading digit and can't be zero), and c must be between 0 and b-1. So n = a*b + c.

The second condition is that the sum of the digits, which is a + c, equals the square root of n. So sqrt(n) = a + c. That means n must be a perfect square because the square root is an integer.

So putting these together, we have:

n = a*b + c
sqrt(n) = a + c
=> n = (a + c)^2

So substituting, we get:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Let me rearrange this equation to make it easier to handle. Let's expand the left side:

a² + 2ac + c² = a*b + c

Bring all terms to one side:

a² + 2ac + c² - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, maybe factor terms:

a² + (2c - b)a + (c² - c) = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of a. Let me write it as:

a² + (2c - b)a + (c² - c) = 0

For each c, this equation can be solved for a. But since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, the discriminant must be a perfect square.

The discriminant D of the quadratic equation is:

D = (2c - b)^2 - 4*(1)*(c² - c)
= 4c² -4b c + b² -4c² +4c
= (-4b c) + b² +4c

Simplify:

D = b² -4b c +4c

Which can be written as:

D = b² +4c -4b c

Factor terms:

D = b² -4b c +4c = b² -4c(b - 1)

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. 

---------------

Alternatively, maybe factor 4c:

D = b² +4c(1 - b)



---------------

Wait, perhaps I can factor it differently. Let's see:

D = b² -4c(b -1)

Yes, that's better.

So for each c, the discriminant must be a perfect square because a must be an integer. So let me write:

D = b² -4c(b -1) = k², where k is some integer.

So, b² -4c(b -1) = k².

Now, our variables are b, c, a, and k, all integers, with b >=2, 0 <= c <= b-1, 1 <= a <= b-1.

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can find a relation between a and c first.

From the equation:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Let me rearrange it as:

(a + c)^2 - a*b = c

Which is:

a² + 2ac + c² - a*b = c

Let me bring all terms to the left:

a² + 2ac + c² - a*b - c = 0



---------------

Wait, I think I did this earlier. Maybe instead, I can express b in terms of a and c.

From n = (a + c)^2 = a*b + c, so:

b = [(a + c)^2 - c]/a

Simplify numerator:

(a + c)^2 - c = a² + 2ac + c² - c

So,

b = (a² + 2ac + c² - c)/a

Which can be rewritten as:

b = a + 2c + (c² - c)/a

Since b must be an integer, the term (c² - c)/a must be an integer.

So, (c² - c) must be divisible by a.

Hmm, that's an important point. So a divides (c² - c). Which is c(c -1). So a | c(c -1).

Given that a is a digit in base b, so a >=1 and a <= b-1. Also, since n is two-digit in base b, a must be at least 1 and less than b.

Given that, perhaps for each a and c, we can find possible b.

But this might take a while. Maybe another approach is better.

Let me think about the equation again:

n = a*b + c = (a + c)^2

So,

a*b + c = a² + 2ac + c²

Rearranged:

a*b = a² + 2ac + c² - c

Divide both sides by a:

b = a + 2c + (c² - c)/a

So,

b = a + 2c + (c(c -1))/a

Since b must be an integer, (c(c -1)) must be divisible by a.

So, a divides c(c-1). So for each possible c, a must be a divisor of c(c-1). But a is between 1 and b-1, but b is also a variable here.



---------------

Wait, but perhaps for each c, a can be a factor of c(c-1). So, let me consider c from 0 to b-1, but c can't be too big because n has two digits in base b.



---------------

Wait, but c is a digit, so c can be from 0 to b-1. But in the expression (c(c -1))/a, a must be a positive integer.

So, let me consider that for each c, a must be a divisor of c(c -1). So for each c, I can list the possible a's.

But since c is between 0 and b-1, and a is between 1 and b-1, perhaps for each a and c, such that a divides c(c-1), we can compute b as:

b = a + 2c + (c(c -1))/a

And then check if b is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and whether the digits a and c in base b are valid (i.e., a < b and c < b).



---------------

Wait, but c < b is given because it's a digit in base b. Also, a must be less than b as well.

So, perhaps for each a and c, compute b and check if b > a and b > c.

But this approach might be time-consuming. Maybe I can find some constraints on a and c.

Let me think about the equation again:

n = a*b + c = (a + c)^2

So, n is a perfect square, and it's equal to a*b + c. So, for each base b, the possible numbers n are two-digit numbers in base b, which are perfect squares, and their digits sum to their square roots.

So, another approach is to iterate over possible bases b and count how many two-digit numbers in base b satisfy the condition.

But the problem is to find the smallest b where there are more than ten such numbers.

So, perhaps instead of trying to find a general formula, I can iterate over b starting from 2 upwards, and for each b, count the number of two-digit numbers in base b that satisfy the condition.

That might be more straightforward, even though it's computational. But since I have to do this manually, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula.



---------------

Wait, for each b, the two-digit numbers in base b are from b (which is 10_b) up to (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b² -1.

So, n ranges from b to b² -1.

And n must be a perfect square, so n = k², where k is an integer such that sqrt(b) <= k <= sqrt(b² -1). Since sqrt(b² -1) is just below b, so k can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1.



---------------

Wait, but for example, if b=13, as in the example, n=81, which is 9², and 9 is less than 13, so that works.

So, for each base b, the possible k (the square roots) are integers from 2 up to floor(sqrt(b² -1)).

But sqrt(b² -1) is less than b, so k can be up to b-1.



---------------

Wait, but when b is a perfect square, say b=16, then sqrt(b² -1) is sqrt(255)=~15.97, so k can be up to 15.

So, for each base b, the possible k's are integers from 2 up to floor(sqrt(b² -1))=b-1.

So, for each k in 2 to b-1, we can express n=k², and then write n in base b as a two-digit number a c, such that a = floor(n/b) and c = n mod b.

Then, check if a + c = k.

If yes, then n is b-eautiful.

So, the process is:

1. For each base b starting from 2, iterate.

2. For each b, iterate k from 2 up to b-1.

3. For each k, compute n=k².

4. Check if n has exactly two digits in base b, which it does if n >= b and n < b².

5. Convert n to base b to get digits a and c.

6. Check if a + c = k. If yes, count this as a b-eautiful number.

7. After checking all k for a base b, record the count.

8. Find the smallest b where the count exceeds 10.

This seems manageable, but since I have to do it manually, perhaps I can find a formula or pattern.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe I can express a and c in terms of k and b.

Given that n = k² = a*b + c.

So, a = floor(k² / b)

c = k² mod b

And the condition is a + c = k.

So,

a + c = k

But a = floor(k² / b) = (k² - c)/b

So,

(k² - c)/b + c = k

Multiply both sides by b:

k² - c + b c = b k

Rearranged:

k² - b k + c(b -1) = 0

Hmm, so this is a linear equation in terms of c.

Let me write it as:

c(b - 1) = b k - k²

So,

c = (b k - k²)/(b - 1)

Simplify numerator:

b k - k² = k(b - k)

So,

c = [k(b - k)] / (b - 1)

Since c must be an integer between 0 and b-1, the numerator must be divisible by (b -1). Also, c must satisfy 0 <= c < b.

So,

c = [k(b - k)] / (b -1)

Let me write this as:

c = k * (b - k) / (b - 1)

Hmm, perhaps I can rewrite this as:

c = k * [ (b - k) / (b - 1) ]

Which is c = k * [1 - (k -1)/(b -1)]

Not sure if that helps.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps express b in terms of k and c.



---------------

Wait, but maybe another approach.

Since c must be an integer, [k(b - k)] must be divisible by (b -1).

So,

k(b - k) ≡ 0 mod (b -1)

But since (b -1) divides k(b -k), let's see:

Let me write m = b -1, so m >=1 since b >=2.

Then,

k(b - k) = k(m +1 -k) = k(m +1 -k)

We have:

k(m +1 -k) ≡ 0 mod m

Which is:

k(m +1 -k) ≡ 0 mod m

But m divides k(m +1 -k), so:

k(m +1 -k) ≡ 0 mod m

Which is equivalent to:

k(m +1 -k) ≡ 0 mod m

But m is b-1, which is positive.

So, expanding:

k(m +1 -k) = k m + k -k²

Which is:

k m + k -k² ≡ 0 mod m

Since k m ≡ 0 mod m, the equation reduces to:

k - k² ≡ 0 mod m

Which is:

k(1 - k) ≡ 0 mod m

So,

k(k -1) ≡ 0 mod m

So, m divides k(k -1). Since m = b -1, this implies that (b -1) divides k(k -1).

So, (b -1) | k(k -1)

Which is, for each k, b -1 must be a divisor of k(k -1).

So, for a given k, the possible m = b-1 are the divisors of k(k -1).

Therefore, for each k, the possible m's are the divisors of k(k -1). Then, b = m +1.

So, for each k, m can be any divisor of k(k -1), and then b = m +1.

But since b must be greater than k (because n =k² is a two-digit number in base b, so k² >= b, but also k < b because n is two digits, so k² < b². So, k < b, hence b >k.

So, for each k, m = b -1 must be a divisor of k(k -1), and m >= k (since b = m +1 >k => m >=k).



---------------

Wait, no. 

---------------

Wait, if b >k, then m = b -1 >=k. Because b >k implies m = b -1 >=k.



---------------

Wait, let's see: if b >k, then m = b -1 >=k.

Because if b >k, then m = b -1 >=k -1 +1 =k.



---------------

Wait, no. For example, if b =k +1, then m =k.



---------------

Wait, b =k +1: m =k.

So, m can be as small as k.

So, m >=k.

But m must also be a divisor of k(k -1). So, m must be a divisor of k(k -1) and m >=k.

So, for each k, m can be any divisor of k(k -1) that is >=k.

So, for each k, we can find all m >=k such that m divides k(k -1). Then, b = m +1.



---------------

Wait, but m must be a divisor of k(k -1) and m >=k.

But k(k -1) is equal to k² -k.

So, for m >=k, m divides k² -k.

So, m is a divisor of k² -k and m >=k.

Hmm, but m must satisfy m | k(k -1) and m >=k.

So, for each k, the possible m's are the divisors of k(k -1) that are >=k.

Therefore, for each k, the possible m's are the divisors of k(k -1) which are >=k.

So, for each k, we can compute the divisors of k(k -1) that are >=k, and for each such m, set b = m +1.

Then, for each such b, we have a two-digit number in base b, which is k², with digits a and c, where a = floor(k² / b) and c = k² mod b, and a + c =k.



---------------

Wait, but maybe this is a way to parameterize all possible b's for each k.

But I'm not sure if this is helpful for counting how many b's have more than ten such numbers.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the number of possible k's for a given b.



---------------

Wait, since for each b, the possible k's are from 2 up to b-1, but only those k's for which (b -1) divides k(k -1).

So, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of k's in [2, b-1] such that (b -1) divides k(k -1).

So, the count is the number of integers k in [2, b-1] where (b -1) divides k(k -1).

Thus, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of k in [2, b-1] such that (b -1) divides k(k -1).

So, to find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10, I need to find the smallest b such that the number of k's in [2, b-1] with (b -1) | k(k -1) is greater than 10.

So, perhaps I can think about (b -1) as a number m, and count the number of k's in [2, m] such that m divides k(k -1).

Because m = b -1, so k can be from 2 to m.

So, for each m, count the number of k in [2, m] such that m divides k(k -1). Then, b = m +1.

We need to find the smallest m such that this count is >10, then b = m +1.

So, the problem reduces to finding the smallest m where the number of k in [2, m] with m | k(k -1) is greater than 10.

Hmm, now, for a given m, how can we count the number of k's in [2, m] such that m divides k(k -1)?

This is equivalent to finding the number of k in [2, m] such that k(k -1) ≡ 0 mod m.

So, k(k -1) ≡0 mod m.

Which implies that either k ≡0 mod m or k ≡1 mod m.

But k is in [2, m], so:

- If k ≡0 mod m, then k must be m, but since k <=m, the only possibility is k=m.

But k must be at least 2, so if m >=2, then k=m is a solution.

- If k ≡1 mod m, then k=1 + t*m, but since k <=m, the only possibility is k=1, which is not in [2, m], so this doesn't contribute any solutions.



---------------

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because for m=6, for example, let's see:



---------------

Wait, let's take m=6, so b=7.

We need to find k in [2,6] such that 6 divides k(k-1).

So, let's compute k(k-1) for k=2: 2*1=2, which is not divisible by 6.

k=3: 3*2=6, which is divisible by 6.

k=4: 4*3=12, which is divisible by 6.

k=5:5*4=20, which is not divisible by 6.

k=6:6*5=30, which is divisible by 6.

So, for m=6, the k's are 3,4,6.

So, count is 3.

But according to the previous logic, only k=m=6 would satisfy k≡0 mod m, but in reality, k=3 and 4 also satisfy 6 divides k(k-1).

So, my earlier conclusion was incorrect.

Therefore, the initial approach that only k=m is a solution is wrong.

So, I need a better way to count the number of k in [2, m] such that m divides k(k -1).

Which is, for each m, count the number of k in [2, m] such that m |k(k -1).

So, perhaps for each m, the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of m in a certain way.



---------------

Wait, another approach: For each m, the condition m |k(k-1) implies that k and k-1 must cover all the prime factors of m.

Since k and k-1 are coprime (consecutive integers), m must be such that all prime factors of m are in either k or k-1.

So, for m to divide k(k-1), m must be a product of factors of k and factors of k-1.

But since k and k-1 are coprime, m must be a product of a divisor of k and a divisor of k-1.



---------------

Wait, perhaps that's overcomplicating.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps for each m, the number of k's in [2, m] such that m divides k(k -1) is equal to the number of divisors d of m where d <= m and d divides k or d divides k-1.

But I'm not sure.



---------------

Wait, perhaps it's better to note that for m, the number of k's in [2, m] where m divides k(k -1) is equal to the number of integers k in [2, m] such that k ≡0 or 1 mod p for every prime power p dividing m.

But this might not be helpful.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps for each m, the number of such k's is equal to the number of divisors of m that are in [2, m], but that doesn't seem correct.



---------------

Wait, let's think about the equation k(k-1) ≡0 mod m.

Which is equivalent to k ≡0 or 1 mod m.

But as we saw earlier, this isn't the case because for m=6, k=3 and 4 also satisfy 6 |k(k-1).

So, perhaps the condition is that m divides k(k-1), but k is less than or equal to m.

So, perhaps for m, the number of k's is equal to the number of divisors of m in the range [2, m], but I'm not sure.



---------------

Wait, let's take m=6 again.

Divisors of 6 are 1,2,3,6.

So, in [2,6], the divisors are 2,3,6.

So, the count is 3, which matches the earlier example where k=3,4,6.



---------------

Wait, but 4 is not a divisor of 6. So, that approach doesn't hold.

Hmm.



---------------

Wait, but in the case of m=6, the k's that satisfy are 3,4,6.

But 3 is a divisor, 4 is not, and 6 is a divisor.

So, perhaps it's not directly the number of divisors.



---------------

Wait, but let's see another example.

Take m=4.

Divisors are 1,2,4.

So, in [2,4], the divisors are 2,4.

Now, find k in [2,4] such that 4 divides k(k-1).

k=2: 2*1=2, not divisible by 4.

k=3:3*2=6, not divisible by 4.

k=4:4*3=12, which is divisible by 4.

So, only k=4 satisfies, which is one solution.

But the number of divisors in [2,4] is 2 (2 and 4), but only one k satisfies.

So, that approach doesn't work.



---------------

Another example: m=8.

Divisors of 8 in [2,8] are 2,4,8.

Find k in [2,8] such that 8 divides k(k-1).

k=2: 2*1=2, no.

k=3:3*2=6, no.

k=4:4*3=12, no.

k=5:5*4=20, no.

k=6:6*5=30, no.

k=7:7*6=42, no.

k=8:8*7=56, yes.

So, only k=8 satisfies, count=1.

But the number of divisors in [2,8] is 3, but count is 1.

Hmm, so that approach isn't correct.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I should think about the multiplicative factors.

Since m divides k(k-1), and k and k-1 are coprime, m must be a product of two coprime factors, one dividing k and the other dividing k-1.

So, for m, write m = d*e, where d and e are coprime, and d divides k, e divides k-1.

Then, k ≡0 mod d and k≡1 mod e.

By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there is a unique solution modulo d*e=m.

So, for each such pair (d,e), coprime and d*e = m, there's exactly one solution k modulo m.

But since we're looking for k in [2, m], there can be either one or zero solutions depending on whether the solution is within the range.



---------------

Wait, but for each factorization m = d*e with d and e coprime, there is exactly one solution k in [1, m], so in [2, m], it's either one or zero.

Therefore, the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to factor m into two coprime factors d and e, such that d*e = m.

Each such factorization gives one solution k in [1, m]. Since k must be >=2, we subtract any solution where k=1.

So, the number of solutions is equal to the number of such coprime factorizations.

But the number of such factorizations is 2^{ω(m)-1}, where ω(m) is the number of distinct prime factors of m.



---------------

Wait, because for each prime factor, we decide whether to assign it to d or e, but since d and e must be coprime, each prime factor goes entirely to d or e. So, the number of coprime factorizations is 2^{ω(m)}.

But since d and e are ordered (d divides k, e divides k-1), but swapping d and e would give a different solution unless d=e=1, which is not possible here because m >=2.



---------------

Wait, actually, for each coprime factorization, we have two possibilities unless d=e=1, which isn't the case here. So, the number of such factorizations is 2^{ω(m)}.

But for each such factorization, we get a unique k in [1, m].

But since we're interested in k in [2, m], we need to subtract the case where k=1.

So, the number of solutions is 2^{ω(m)} -1.



---------------

Wait, let's test this with m=6.

m=6 has ω(m)=2 (primes 2 and 3).

So, number of solutions=2^{2} -1=3, which matches the earlier example where k=3,4,6.



---------------

Another test: m=4.

ω(m)=1 (only prime 2).

So, number of solutions=2^1 -1=1, which matches the earlier case where only k=4 worked.



---------------

Another test: m=8.

ω(m)=1 (only prime 2).

So, number of solutions=2^1 -1=1, which matches the earlier case where only k=8 worked.



---------------

Another test: m=12.

ω(m)=2 (primes 2,3).

Number of solutions=2^2 -1=3.

Let's see:

m=12, so b=13.

Looking for k in [2,12] such that 12 divides k(k-1).

Compute k(k-1) for k=2 to 12:

k=2: 2*1=2 → no
k=3: 3*2=6 → no
k=4:4*3=12 → yes
k=5:5*4=20 → no
k=6:6*5=30 → yes (30/12=2.5 → no, wait 30 mod12=6 → no. 

---------------

Wait, 30 is not divisible by12. 

---------------

Wait, 12 divides 30? 30/12=2.5, which is not integer. So, no.



---------------

Wait, maybe I made a mistake.



---------------

Wait, 12 divides k(k-1) means k(k-1) mod12=0.

So, let's compute for m=12:

k=2: 2*1=2 mod12=2 → no
k=3:3*2=6 mod12=6 → no
k=4:4*3=12 mod12=0 → yes
k=5:5*4=20 mod12=8 → no
k=6:6*5=30 mod12=6 → no
k=7:7*6=42 mod12=6 → no
k=8:8*7=56 mod12=8 → no
k=9:9*8=72 mod12=0 → yes
k=10:10*9=90 mod12=6 → no
k=11:11*10=110 mod12=10 → no
k=12:12*11=132 mod12=0 → yes

So, k=4,9,12 satisfy. That's three solutions, which matches 2^{2} -1=3.

So, the formula seems to hold.



---------------

Another test: m=9.

ω(m)=1 (prime 3).

Number of solutions=2^1 -1=1.

Check:

k in [2,9].

k=3:3*2=6 → 6 mod9=6 → no
k=4:4*3=12 mod9=3 → no
k=5:5*4=20 mod9=2 → no
k=6:6*5=30 mod9=3 → no
k=7:7*6=42 mod9=6 → no
k=8:8*7=56 mod9=2 → no
k=9:9*8=72 mod9=0 → yes.

So, only k=9 works, count=1. Which matches.



---------------

Another test: m=10.

ω(m)=2 (primes 2,5).

Number of solutions=2^2 -1=3.

Check:

k=5:5*4=20 mod10=0 → yes
k=6:6*5=30 mod10=0 → yes
k=10:10*9=90 mod10=0 → yes



---------------

Wait, but wait, k=5:5*4=20, which is divisible by10.

k=6:6*5=30, which is divisible by10.

k=10:10*9=90, which is divisible by10.

So, k=5,6,10. That's three solutions. Correct.



---------------

Wait, but in the range [2,10], k=5,6,10.

Yes, so count=3.

So, the formula holds.

Therefore, the number of k's in [2, m] such that m divides k(k -1) is 2^{ω(m)} -1, where ω(m) is the number of distinct prime factors of m.

So, to have more than ten b-eautiful numbers, we need 2^{ω(m)} -1 >10.

So, 2^{ω(m)} >11.

So, 2^{ω(m)} >11 → ω(m) >=4, since 2^4=16>11.



---------------

Wait, 2^3=8 <11, 2^4=16>11.

So, ω(m) must be at least 4.

Therefore, m must have at least four distinct prime factors.

Thus, the smallest m with ω(m)>=4 is the product of the first four primes: 2,3,5,7.

So, m=2*3*5*7=210.



---------------

Wait, but wait, 210 is the product of the first four primes, which gives ω(m)=4.

But is that the minimal m with ω(m)=4?

Yes, because any smaller number with four distinct prime factors would have to include smaller primes, but 2*3*5*7=210 is the smallest.



---------------

Wait, but let's confirm.

Is there a number less than 210 with four distinct prime factors?

No, because the next possible would be 2*3*5*7=210. Any smaller number with four distinct primes would have to have primes smaller than 7, but the primes are 2,3,5,7,11,... So, the first four are 2,3,5,7.

So, m=210 is the smallest m with ω(m)=4.

Thus, for m=210, the number of solutions is 2^4 -1=15, which is greater than 10.

Therefore, b=m+1=211.



---------------

But wait, is 211 the minimal b?



---------------

Wait, perhaps there is a smaller m with ω(m)=4.



---------------

Wait, m=210 is the smallest with four distinct primes, but perhaps a number with ω(m)=4 but not necessarily square-free? 

---------------

Wait, no, ω(m) counts distinct prime factors regardless of multiplicity.



---------------

Wait, but for example, m=16 has ω(m)=1, but m=12 has ω(m)=2.



---------------

Wait, but 210 is the smallest m with ω(m)=4.

So, the minimal m is 210, which gives b=211.



---------------

But wait, let's check if m=105 (which is 3*5*7) has ω(m)=3, so 2^3 -1=7<10.

Similarly, m=60=2^2*3*5, ω(m)=3, 2^3 -1=7<10.

m=105: same.

m=120: same.



---------------

Wait, m=105, 120, etc., all have ω(m)=3, so 2^3 -1=7<10.

Thus, the first m where ω(m)=4 is 210, giving 15 solutions.

Thus, b=211 is the minimal base where the count exceeds 10.



---------------

But wait, let me make sure. Is there a smaller m with ω(m)=4?



---------------

Wait, 2*3*5*7=210, but what about 2*3*5*7=210. The next possible is 2*3*5*7*11=2310, which is larger.

So, 210 is indeed the smallest m with four distinct prime factors.

Thus, the minimal b is 211.



---------------

Wait, but let me check m=105 (3*5*7). ω(m)=3, so 2^3 -1=7<10.

Similarly, m=210:15>10.

So, the minimal b is 211.



---------------

Wait, but let me check m=210:

The number of solutions is 15, which is greater than 10. So, b=211.



---------------

But wait, let me think again.



---------------

Wait, the formula is number of solutions=2^{ω(m)} -1.

So, for m=210, ω(m)=4, so 2^4 -1=15>10.

But is there a smaller m where 2^{ω(m)} -1>10?

What's 2^{4}=16>11, so yes, m=210 is the smallest with ω(m)=4.



---------------

But wait, what about m=105? ω(m)=3, 2^3 -1=7<10.

m=120: ω(m)=3, same.

m=165: same.

m=180: same.

m=210: first with ω(m)=4.

Thus, the minimal b is 211.



---------------

Wait, but let me think again. Is there a smaller m where 2^{ω(m)} -1>10?



---------------

Wait, 2^{4}=16, so 16-1=15>10.

What about m=2310, which has ω(m)=5, but that's larger than 210.

So, 210 is the smallest m with ω(m)=4, giving 15 solutions.

Thus, b=211 is the minimal base with more than ten b-eautiful numbers.



---------------

Wait, but let me confirm with m=210.

For m=210, the number of k's in [2,210] such that 210 divides k(k-1) is 15.

Thus, for b=211, there are 15 b-eautiful numbers, which is more than ten.

Therefore, the minimal b is 211.



---------------

But wait, the question says "the least integer b ≥2 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers."

So, is 211 the answer? Or is there a smaller b?



---------------

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the number of solutions is 2^{ω(m)} -1. Let me verify with m=6, which has ω(m)=2.

Number of solutions=2^2 -1=3, which was correct.

Similarly, m=12, ω=2, solutions=3.



---------------

Wait, but what about m=30, which has ω=3 (2,3,5).

Number of solutions=2^3 -1=7.

So, for m=30, b=31.

So, for b=31, number of b-eautiful numbers is 7, which is less than 10.

Similarly, m=60, ω=3, solutions=7.

m=105, ω=3, solutions=7.

m=210, ω=4, solutions=15.

So, the next possible m after 210 with ω=4 is 210 itself, so 211 is the minimal b.



---------------

Wait, but let me check m=105: ω=3, solutions=7.

m=165: same.

m=210: first with ω=4.

So, the minimal b is 211.



---------------

But wait, is there a way to have more than ten solutions without m having four distinct prime factors?



---------------

Wait, perhaps if m is a power of a prime, but for m=p^k, ω(m)=1, so solutions=1.

If m has two distinct primes, ω=2, solutions=3.

If m has three distinct primes, ω=3, solutions=7.

If m has four distinct primes, ω=4, solutions=15.

So, to get more than ten solutions, we need ω(m)>=4, which gives solutions=15.

Thus, the minimal m is 210, giving b=211.

Therefore, the answer is 211.


To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest integer \( b \geq 2 \) such that there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful numbers. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-eautiful if it has exactly two digits in base \( b \) and the sum of these digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

### Key Steps:

1. **Understanding \( b \)-eautiful Numbers**:
   - A \( b \)-eautiful number \( n \) can be expressed as \( n = a \cdot b + c \), where \( a \) and \( c \) are digits in base \( b \) (i.e., \( 1 \leq a \leq b-1 \) and \( 0 \leq c \leq b-1 \)).
   - The sum of the digits \( a + c \) must equal \( \sqrt{n} \), implying \( n \) is a perfect square.

2. **Formulating the Condition**:
   - Given \( n = k^2 \) for some integer \( k \), we have \( k^2 = a \cdot b + c \).
   - The condition becomes \( a + c = k \), leading to the equation \( k^2 = a \cdot b + c \).

3. **Counting \( b \)-eautiful Numbers**:
   - For each base \( b \), the number of \( b \)-eautiful numbers corresponds to the number of integers \( k \) in the range \( [2, b-1] \) such that \( b-1 \) divides \( k(k-1) \).
   - This count is determined by the number of ways \( b-1 \) can be factored into coprime pairs, which is \( 2^{\omega(b-1)} - 1 \), where \( \omega(b-1) \) is the number of distinct prime factors of \( b-1 \).

4. **Finding the Minimal \( b \)**:
   - To have more than ten \( b \)-eautiful numbers, we need \( 2^{\omega(b-1)} - 1 > 10 \).
   - This requires \( \omega(b-1) \geq 4 \), as \( 2^4 - 1 = 15 > 10 \).
   - The smallest \( b-1 \) with \( \omega(b-1) = 4 \) is \( 210 \), which is the product of the first four primes \( 2, 3, 5, 7 \).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Thus, the smallest \( b \) is \( 210 + 1 = 211 \).

### Final Answer:
\boxed{211}
