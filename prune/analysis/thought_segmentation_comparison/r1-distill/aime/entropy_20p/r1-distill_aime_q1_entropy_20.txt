Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of |log₂(x⁴y³z²)| given

---------------

 a system of logarithmic equations. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem gives

---------------

 me three equations involving logarithms with base 2. The variables are x, y, and z, all positive real numbers. The

---------------

 equations are:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

And

---------------

 I need to find |log₂(x⁴y³z²)|, which simplifies to |4 log₂x + 3 log₂y + 2 log₂z|.

---------------

 So, if I can find log₂x, log₂y, and log₂z, I can plug them into this expression and

---------------

 get the desired value.

Let me denote a = log₂x, b = log₂y, and c = log₂z. That

---------------

 might make the equations easier to handle. So, rewriting the original equations in terms of a, b, and c.

Starting

---------------

 with the first equation: log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2.

Using logarithm properties, log₂(x

---------------

) - log₂(y z) = 1/2. Which can be written as log₂x - (log₂y + log₂z) = 1/2.



---------------

Substituting a, b, c, that becomes: a - (b + c) = 1/2.

---------------

 So equation 1 is a - b - c = 1/2.

Similarly, the second equation: log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3.



---------------

Again, using log properties: log₂y - log₂(x z) = 1/3. Which is log₂y - (log₂x + log₂z) = 1/3.

Sub

---------------

stituting a, b, c: b - a - c = 1/3. So equation 2 is -a + b - c = 1/3.

Third

---------------

 equation: log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4.

Which becomes log₂z - log₂(x y) = 1/4.

---------------

 So, log₂z - (log₂x + log₂y) = 1/4.

Substituting a

---------------

, b, c: c - a - b = 1/4. So equation 3 is -a - b + c = 1/4.

Now

---------------

, I have a system of three linear equations:

1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4

I

---------------

 need to solve for a, b, and c. Let me write them again:

Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2


---------------

Equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3
Equation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4

Hmm

---------------

, solving a system of three equations. Let's see. Maybe I can add or subtract equations to eliminate variables.

Let me try

---------------

 adding equation 1 and equation 2 together.

Equation 1 + Equation 2:
(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) = (

---------------

1/2 + 1/3)
Simplify: (a - a) + (-b + b) + (-c - c) = (

---------------

5/6)
So, 0a + 0b - 2c = 5/6
Which simpl

---------------

ifies to: -2c = 5/6 → c = -5/(12)

Wait, so c is

---------------

 negative? But c is log₂z, and z is a positive real number. The logarithm can be negative if z is between

---------------

 0 and 1. That's fine.

So, c = -5/12.

Now, let me note

---------------

 that. c = -5/12.

Next, perhaps I can use equation 1 and equation 3 to find

---------------

 another relation.

Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2
Equation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4

Let

---------------

 me add equations 1 and 3 as well.

Equation 1 + Equation 3:
(a - b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 

---------------

1/2 + 1/4
Simplify: (a - a) + (-b - b) + (-c + c) = 3/4
So

---------------

, 0a - 2b + 0c = 3/4
Which simplifies to: -2b = 3/4 → b = -

---------------

3/(8)

Hmm, so b is also negative. That's okay, same reasoning as before.

So, b = -3/8.

Now

---------------

, I have c and b. Let me plug these back into one of the equations to find a. Let's choose equation 1.



---------------

Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2

Substituting b = -3/8 and

---------------

 c = -5/12:

a - (-3/8) - (-5/12) = 1/2


---------------

Simplify: a + 3/8 + 5/12 = 1/2

Now, let me

---------------

 compute 3/8 + 5/12. To add these, I need a common denominator. The least common denominator

---------------

 of 8 and 12 is 24.

3/8 = 9/24
5/12 = 10/24
So

---------------

, 9/24 + 10/24 = 19/24

Therefore, equation becomes

---------------

: a + 19/24 = 1/2

Convert 1/2 to 12/24.



---------------

So, a + 19/24 = 12/24 → a = 12/24 - 19/24 = -

---------------

7/24

So, a = -7/24.

So now, I have:

a = log₂x = -7/24 →

---------------

 x = 2^(-7/24)
b = log₂y = -3/8 → y = 2^(-3/8)
c = log₂z = -5/12 → z = 2^(-5/12)

But

---------------

 wait, the question is about log₂(x⁴ y³ z²). Let's compute that.

log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = 

---------------

4 log₂x + 3 log₂y + 2 log₂z
Which is 4a + 3b + 2c.



---------------

So, substituting the values:

4a = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6


---------------

3b = 3*(-3/8) = -9/8
2c = 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6

Adding

---------------

 them all together:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6

First, let's combine the terms with

---------------

 denominator 6.

-7/6 -5/6 = (-7 -5)/6 = -12/6 = -2



---------------

Now, we have -2 -9/8.

Convert -2 to eighths: -16/8



---------------

So, -16/8 -9/8 = (-16 -9)/8 = -25/8



---------------

So, log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = -25/8

But the problem asks for the

---------------

 absolute value of this, so | -25/8 | = 25/8.

So, the value is 25/8.

---------------

 They want it as m/n where m and n are coprime positive integers. 25 and 8 share no common factors

---------------

 besides 1, so m=25, n=8.

Thus, m + n = 25 + 

---------------

8 = 33.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting

---------------

 with the system:

1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4

We

---------------

 found c = -5/12, b = -3/8, a = -7/24.

Let

---------------

 me plug these back into the original equations to verify.

Equation 1: a - b - c = (-7/24) - (-3/8) - (-5/12)


---------------

Convert all to 24 denominator:

-7/24 + 9/24 + 10/24 = (-

---------------

7 +9 +10)/24 = 12/24 = 1/2 ✔️

Equation 2: -a + b - c = -

---------------

(-7/24) + (-3/8) - (-5/12)
Which is 7/24 - 

---------------

9/24 + 10/24 = (7 -9 +10)/24 = 8/24 = 1/3 ✔️

Equation 3: -a - b + c = -(-7/24) - (-3/8) + (-5/12)
Which

---------------

 is 7/24 + 9/24 -10/24 = (7 +9 -10)/24 = 

---------------

6/24 = 1/4 ✔️

All equations are satisfied. So, the values of a, b, c are correct.

Then

---------------

, computing 4a +3b +2c:

4a = 4*(-7/24) = -2

---------------

8/24 = -7/6

3b = 3*(-3/8) = -9/8

2c = 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6

Adding

---------------

 together: -7/6 -9/8 -5/6

Convert all to 24 denominator:

-2

---------------

8/24 -27/24 -20/24 = (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24



---------------

Wait, wait, hold on. I think I made a mistake earlier. Because when I converted to 24 denominator,

---------------

 the denominators were 6, 8, and 6.

Wait, let's do it again.

Wait, no

---------------

, let me compute each term:

4a = -7/6 = -28/24

3b = -9/8 = -27/24

2c = -5/6 = -20/24

So

---------------

, adding them: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -

---------------

25/8.

Wait, that's the same as before. So, that's correct. So, log₂(x

---------------

⁴ y³ z²) = -25/8, absolute value is 25/8.

So,

---------------

 25 and 8 are coprime, so m=25, n=8, m +n=

---------------

33.

I think that's correct.


The given system of equations is:

\[
\begin{cases}
\log_2\left(\d

---------------

frac{x}{yz}\right) = \dfrac{1}{2} \\
\log_2\left(\dfrac{y}{xz}\right) = \dfrac{1}{3} \\
\log_2\left(\dfrac{z}{xy}\right) = \dfrac{1}{4}
\end{cases}
\]

Let \( a

---------------

 = \log_2 x \), \( b = \log_2 y \), and \( c = \log_2 z \). Rew

---------------

riting the equations using logarithmic properties:

1. \( a - b - c = \dfrac{1}{2} \)
2. \( -a + b - c = \dfrac{1}{3} \)
3. \( -a - b + c = \dfrac{1}{4} \)

Adding

---------------

 equations 1 and 2:

\[
(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) = \dfrac{1}{2} + \dfrac{1}{3}

---------------

 \implies -2c = \dfrac{5}{6} \implies c = -\dfrac{5}{12}
\]

Adding equations 1 and 3:

\[
(a - b - c) + (-a - b + c) = \dfrac{1}{2} + \dfrac{1}{4} \implies -2b = \dfrac{3}{4} \implies b = -\dfrac{3}{8}
\]

Substituting \( b \

---------------

) and \( c \) into equation 1:

\[
a - \left(-\dfrac{3}{8}\right) - \left(-\dfrac{5}{12}\right) = \dfrac{1}{2} \implies a + \dfrac{3}{8} + \dfrac{5}{12} = \dfrac{1}{2}
\]

Con

---------------

verting to a common denominator:

\[
a + \dfrac{9}{24} + \dfrac{10}{24} = \dfrac{12}{24} \implies a +

---------------

 \dfrac{19}{24} = \dfrac{12}{24} \implies a = -\dfrac{7}{24}
\]

Now

---------------

, compute \( \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \):

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4a + 3b + 2c = 4\left(-\dfrac{7}{24}\right) + 3\left(-\dfrac{3}{8}\right) + 2\left(-\dfrac{5}{12}\right)
\]

S

---------------

implify each term:

\[
4a = -\dfrac{28}{24} = -\dfrac{7}{6}, \quad 3b = -\dfrac{9}{8}, \quad 2c = -\dfrac{10}{12} = -\dfrac{5}{6}
\]

Combine

---------------

 the terms:

\[
-\dfrac{7}{6} - \dfrac{9}{8} - \dfrac{5}{6} = -\dfrac{2

---------------

8}{24} - \dfrac{27}{24} - \dfrac{20}{24} = -\dfrac{75}{24} = -\dfrac{25}{8}
\]

Taking the absolute value:

\[
\left|

---------------

 -\dfrac{25}{8} \right| = \dfrac{25}{8}
\]

Thus

---------------

, \( m = 25 \) and \( n = 8 \), so \( m + n = 33 \).
