Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure

---------------

 it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the question is about binary star systems.

---------------

 There are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses, and their periods are given as 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. The

---------------

 periods are the time between two primary eclipses, so that's the orbital period of the binary system.

Then, there are spectro

---------------

scopic observations about radial velocity (RV) variations. For system_1, the stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System

---------------

_2 has amplitudes of 15 and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. We

---------------

 have to consider the mass of each system as the sum of the two stars' masses.

Hmm, okay. So I remember

---------------

 that in binary stars, the radial velocity method is used to determine the masses of the stars. The idea is that each star orbits the center of mass of the system. The more massive star will have a smaller orbit and

---------------

 thus a smaller velocity amplitude. The less massive star will have a larger orbit and a larger velocity amplitude.

Wait, right,

---------------

 because the center of mass is like the balance point. So the more massive star doesn't have to move as much to keep the balance.

---------------

 So the velocity amplitude (the maximum speed in their orbit) depends inversely on the mass of the star. So if one

---------------

 star is more massive, its velocity amplitude will be smaller.

The formula I think relates the velocity semi-amplitude K to the mass of

---------------

 the star. The formula is something like K = (v * sin i) / (1 + (M2/M1))

---------------

^(1/3), but I might be mixing up some terms. Alternatively, I remember that the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is inversely proportional to the masses of

---------------

 the stars. So K1/K2 = M2/M1, where K1 and K2 are the velocity amplitudes of the two stars.

Wait

---------------

, let me think again. Each star's velocity amplitude is inversely proportional to its mass. So if star A is more massive than star B, star

---------------

 A's velocity amplitude will be smaller. So if system_1 has K1 = 10 and K2 =5, then

---------------

 their masses would be in the ratio of 5:10, which is 1:2. So M1a

---------------

 is twice M1b. Because K is inversely proportional to mass.

Wait, maybe the formula is K1 = (M

---------------

2/(M1+M2)) * (2π G / (P (1 - e²)^(3/2)))^(1/3)

---------------

 )^(1/ something). Hmm, perhaps that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, for a circular orbit (which is probably

---------------

 assumed here), the radial velocity semi-amplitude for each star is given by K = ( (2π G) / (P (1 -

---------------

 e²)^(3/2)) )^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

---------------

 )^(1/ something). Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the fact

---------------

 that the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses. So K1/K2 = M2/M1.



---------------

In system_1, the two velocities are 10 and 5. So K1 =10, K2=5. So K

---------------

1/K2 = 2. So M2/M1 = 2, so M1 = M2 / 2.

Wait, but

---------------

 wait, the question is about the total mass of the system. So system_1's total mass is M1a + M1b, and system_2's is M2a + M2b.

Wait

---------------

, perhaps another approach is to use the formula for the mass function, but that might not be necessary here.

Alternatively, the

---------------

 mass of each star can be found using the radial velocity data. The formula for the mass function is f(M) = (K^3 P) / (24

---------------

1 * pi^3 G), but that might involve more steps. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the mass ratio first.

Wait

---------------

, let me think again. For each binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star has a smaller orbit.

---------------

 The velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses. So K1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) * V

---------------

, and K2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) * V. But V is the same for both,

---------------

 since they have the same orbital speed but in opposite directions. So K1/K2 = M2/M1.

In system_1: K1=

---------------

10, K2=5. So K1/K2 = 2 = M2/M1. So M2 = 2 M

---------------

1. So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1. So M1_system

---------------

 = 3 M1.

Wait, but wait, wait. The system's total mass is M1 + M2.

---------------

 So in system_1, the stars have masses M1a and M1b, with K1a=10 and K1b=5. So K

---------------

1a/K1b = M1b/M1a = 10/5 = 2. So M1b = 2 M1a.

So

---------------

 the total mass of system_1 is M1a + M1b = M1a + 2 M1a = 3 M1a.

Similarly, in

---------------

 system_2, the K values are 15 and 10. So K2a=15, K2b=10. So

---------------

 K2a/K2b = M2b/M2a =15/10 = 3/2. So M2b = (3/2) M2a.

So

---------------

 the total mass of system_2 is M2a + M2b = M2a + (3/2 M2a) = (5/2) M2a.

But

---------------

 wait, how does the orbital period factor into this? Because the period is the same for both stars in a system. So

---------------

 the period P is same for both stars in each system.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the mass function, which relates the velocity

---------------

 amplitudes, the period, and the masses.

The mass function for a spectroscopic binary is f(M) = (K

---------------

^3 P) / (241.3), where K is in km/s, P is in years, and f(M) is in solar masses. But

---------------

 I'm not sure if that's the right formula. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the mass of the companion star.



---------------

Wait, another approach: The mass ratio q is M2/M1. From the velocity amplitudes, q = K1/K2.

---------------

 Wait, no, earlier I thought K1/K2 = M2/M1. So in system_1, K1=

---------------

10, K2=5 → K1/K2=2 → M2/M1 = 2 → M2=2 M1. So the

---------------

 mass ratio q1 = M2/M1 = 2.

Similarly, in system_2, K1=15, K2=10 → K1/K2=1.5 → M2/M1 =1.5 → M2=1.5 M1.



---------------

Wait, but in each system, the primary star (the more massive one) would have the smaller velocity amplitude. Because more

---------------

 massive star has smaller orbit, so smaller velocity.

Wait, let me get this straight. Let's say in system_1, the

---------------

 two stars have velocities 10 and 5. So star A has K=10, star B has K=5. Since

---------------

 star A is moving faster, it must be less massive. So M_A is less than M_B. So M_A/M

---------------

_B = K_B / K_A =5/10=1/2. So M_A is half of M_B. So M

---------------

_B is twice M_A. So the total mass is M_A + M_B = M_A + 2 M_A =3 M_A.

Similarly

---------------

, in system_2, K1=15 and K2=10. So star A has K=15, star B has K=10. So M

---------------

_A is less than M_B because K_A is larger. So M_A/M_B = K_B/K_A =10/15=2/3. So M_A =

---------------

 (2/3) M_B. So total mass is M_A + M_B = (2/3 M_B) + M_B = (5/3) M_B.

But

---------------

 wait, how does this relate to the orbital period? Because the period is different for the two systems. System_1 has a period of 2 years, system_2 has 1 year.

Ah

---------------

, right! The period affects the total mass of the system. Because the period is the time it takes for the stars to orbit each other, which

---------------

 depends on their masses and the size of their orbit.

The formula that relates the period to the masses is Kepler's third law.

---------------

 The version for a binary system is P^2 = (4π²/G(M1 + M2)) ) a^3, where a is the separation between the two stars. But I

---------------

'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to use the formula for the velocity amplitude

---------------

 in terms of the period and the masses.

The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(

---------------

2/3) (P)^(1/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

Assuming circular

---------------

 orbits (e=0), and that i is 90 degrees (so sin i =1), which is often the case when

---------------

 eclipses are observed, so edge-on orbit.

So K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M2) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) )

We

---------------

 can rearrange this to find the mass function, but perhaps it's easier to take the ratio of K for each star and

---------------

 then find the total mass.

Alternatively, since both stars in each system have their own K values, perhaps we can find the ratio

---------------

 of the total masses of the two systems.

Wait, but let me think again about the formula. For each system, each

---------------

 star's K is related to the other star's mass and the period. So for system_1:

K1a = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M1b) / ( (M1a + M1b)^(2/3) (P1)^(1/3) )

Similarly,

K1b = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M1a) / ( (M1a + M1b)^(2/3) (P1)^(1/3) )

So

---------------

 K1a/K1b = M1b / M1a → which we already knew, since K1a=

---------------

10, K1b=5 → K1a/K1b=2 → M1b=2 M1a.

Similarly

---------------

, for system_2:

K2a=15, K2b=10 → K2a/K2b=1.5 → M2b=1.5 M2a.

So

---------------

 the total mass for system_1 is M1a + M1b = M1a + 2 M1a =3 M1a.

System

---------------

_2's total mass is M2a + M2b = M2a + 1.5 M2a = 2.5 M2a.

Now, to

---------------

 find the mass of each system, we need to relate M1a and M2a to some common variable. Because the

---------------

 period is different, the total mass will also depend on the period.

Wait, perhaps I can write the K equations for each system and

---------------

 then relate them to the periods.

For system_1:

K1a = 10 = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M1b) / ( (M1a + M1b)^(2/3) (P1)^(1/3) )

But

---------------

 M1b =2 M1a, so M1a + M1b =3 M1a.

So,



---------------

10 = (2π G)^(1/3) * (2 M1a) / ( (3 M1a)^(2/3) * (2)^(1/3) )

Similarly

---------------

, for system_2:

K2a=15 = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M2b) / ( (M2a + M2b)^(2/3) * (P2)^(1/3) )

M2b=1.5 M2a, so M2a + M2b=2.5 M2a.

So,

15 = (2π G)^(1/3) * (1.5 M2a) / ( (2.5 M2a)^(2/3) * (1)^(1/3) )

Hmm

---------------

, maybe I can set up the equations to find M1a and M2a in terms of G and P.

Wait

---------------

, perhaps I can write the K for each system in terms of the total mass and the period.

Wait, let me take

---------------

 the ratio of the K values for each system. Let's see.

For system_1, K1a=10,

---------------

 K1b=5.

For system_2, K2a=15, K2b=10.

Wait

---------------

, but perhaps it's better to take the ratio of K in each system to find the ratio of their total masses.

Wait

---------------

, perhaps I can write the equation for K1a and K2a, then take their ratio.

So,

K1a = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M1b) / ( (M1a + M1b)^(2/3) * P1^(1/3) )

Similarly,

K2a = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M2b) / ( (M2a + M2b)^(2/3) * P2^(1/3) )

Take

---------------

 the ratio K1a / K2a:

(10) / (15) = [ (M1b) / (M1a + M1b)^(2/3) * P1^(1/3) ) ] / [ (M2b) / (M2a + M2b)^(2/3) * P2^(1/3) ) ]

Simplify:



---------------

2/3 = [ (M1b) * (M2a + M2b)^(2/3) * P2^(1/3) ) ] / [ (M2b) * (M1a + M1b)^(2/3) * P1^(1/3) ) ]

Now

---------------

, substitute the known values:

M1b = 2 M1a → M1a + M1b =3 M1a



---------------

M2b=1.5 M2a → M2a + M2b=2.5 M2a

P

---------------

1=2, P2=1.

So,

2/3 = [ (2 M1a) * (2.5 M2a)^(2/3) * (1)^(1/3) ) ] / [ (1.5 M2a) * (3 M1a)^(2/3) * (2)^(1/3) ) ]

Hmm

---------------

, this looks a bit messy. Let me try to simplify this.

First, let me compute each part.

Numerator:



---------------

(2 M1a) * (2.5 M2a)^(2/3) * 1

Denominator:

(1.5 M2a) * (3 M1a)^(2/3) * (2)^(1/3)

So,



---------------

2/3 = [2 M1a * (2.5 M2a)^(2/3) ] / [ 1.5 M2a * (3 M1a)^(2/3) * 2^(1/3) ) ]

Let

---------------

 me factor out M1a and M2a terms.

Let me write each term as exponents:

= [ 2 * (2.5)^(2/3) * M1a * (M2a)^(2/3) ) ] / [ 1.5 * M2a * (3)^(2/3) * (M1a)^(2/3) ) * 2^(1/3) ) ]

Hmm

---------------

, let's rearrange the terms:

= [2 / (1.5 * 3^(2/3) * 2^(1/3)) ) ] * [ (2.5)^(2/3) / (3

---------------

^(2/3) ) ) ] * [ M1a / M2a^(1 - 2/3) ) ] 



---------------

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write each part as exponents:

Let me compute the constants first.

Numerator constants: 2 * (2.5)^(2/3)

Denominator constants: 1.5 * (3)^(2/3) * 2^(1/3)

Then

---------------

, M1a terms: M1a * (M1a)^(-2/3) )= M1a^(1 - 2/3)= M1a^(1/3)

M2a terms: (M2a)^(2/3) / M2a =

---------------

 M2a^(2/3 - 1) )= M2a^(-1/3)

So,

2

---------------

/3 = [ (2 * (2.5)^(2/3) ) / (1.5 * (3)^(2/3) * 2^(1/3) ) ) ] * [ M1a^(1/3) /

---------------

 M2a^(1/3) ) ]

Wait, because M1a^(1/3) / M2a^(1/3) =

---------------

 (M1a/M2a)^(1/3).

So,

Let me compute the constants:

Let me compute the

---------------

 fraction:

(2 * (2.5)^(2/3)) ) / (1.5 * (3)^(2/3) * 2^(1/3)) )

I

---------------

'll compute each part step by step.

First, 2.5 = 5/2, so (2.5)^(2/3) = (5/2)^(2/3) = (

---------------

5)^(2/3) / (2)^(2/3).

Similarly, 3^(2/3) is 

---------------

3^(2/3), and 2^(1/3) is 2^(1/3).

So,

N

---------------

umerator: 2 * [5^(2/3) / 2^(2/3) ]

Denominator: 1.5 * [3^(2/3) ] * 2^(1/3)

So,



---------------

Putting it all together:

Numerator: 2 * 5^(2/3) / 2^(2/3)

---------------

 = 2^(1) *5^(2/3) / 2^(2/3) )= 2^(1 - 2/3) *5^(2/3) = 2^(1/3) *5^(2/3)

Denominator: 1.5 *3^(2/3) *2^(1/3) =

---------------

 (3/2) *3^(2/3) *2^(1/3) )

Wait, 1.5 is 3/2.

So,



---------------

Denominator: (3/2) *3^(2/3) *2^(1/3) = 3^(1 + 2/3) * 2^(-1 +

---------------

 1/3) )= 3^(5/3) * 2^(-2/3)

So,

---------------

 the entire fraction becomes:

[2^(1/3) *5^(2/3)] / [3^(5/3) * 2^(-2/3)] )

---------------

 = [2^(1/3) *5^(2/3) ] * [3^(-5/3) * 2^(2/3) ) ]

Multiply

---------------

 the exponents:

2^(1/3 + 2/3) = 2^1 = 2.

5^(2/3) remains.

3^(-5/3) remains

---------------

.

So,

2 *5^(2/3) *3^(-5/3) = 2 * (5^2 /

---------------

 3^5 )^(1/3) )

Wait, 5^2 is 25, 3^5 is 243.

So,

2

---------------

 * (25/243)^(1/3)

Hmm, but let me compute this numerically.

Compute

---------------

 25/243: approximately 0.1028868.

The cube root of 0.1028868 is approximately

---------------

 0.47.

So,

2 * 0.47 ≈0.94.

Wait, but

---------------

 let me be more precise.

Cube of 0.47: 0.47^3 = 0.47 *0.47=0.2209;

---------------

 *0.47≈0.1039. Oh, that's very close to 0.1028868. So cube

---------------

 root is about 0.47.

So, 2 *0.47=0.94.

So,

---------------

 the fraction is approximately 0.94.

So, the equation becomes:

2/3 ≈ 0.94 * (M1a/M2a)^(1/3)

So

---------------

, 0.94 * (M1a/M2a)^(1/3) ≈ 2/3 �

---------------

�0.6667.

So,

(M1a/M2a)^(1/3) ≈ 0.6667 / 0.94 ≈ 0.709.

So

---------------

,

M1a/M2a ≈ (0.709)^3 ≈ 0.355.

So, M1a ≈ 0.355 M2a.

But

---------------

 wait, let me recheck the calculations because this is getting a bit complicated.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way.

---------------

 Maybe using the mass function.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the total mass of each system in terms of their periods and velocity

---------------

 amplitudes.

Wait, the mass function for a binary system is f(M) = (K^3 P) / (241.3).



---------------

But I'm not sure about the exact formula. Let me look it up mentally.

The mass function is given by:

f(M) = (M

---------------

2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) ) = (K1^3 P) / (241.3)



---------------

But since we have two stars, each with their own K, perhaps I can find the total mass of each system.

But I

---------------

'm not sure if this is the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the total mass.

Wait, another

---------------

 approach: The total mass M = M1 + M2 can be found using the formula:

M = (4π² a³) / (G P²)



---------------

Where a is the separation between the stars. But without knowing a, this might not help directly.

Alternatively, using the relation

---------------

 between the velocity amplitudes and the masses, perhaps I can find the ratio of the total masses of the two systems.

Wait

---------------

, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me try a different approach.

Each system's total mass can be determined

---------------

 using the formula:

M = (K1^3 P) / (241.3 * sin^3 i )



---------------

But since both systems are eclipsing, sin i is approximately 1.

Wait, but each system has two stars, each with their own K. So

---------------

 perhaps for each system, the mass function can be written for each star, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 the mass ratio can be determined, and then using the periods, the total masses can be compared.

Wait, perhaps I should consider

---------------

 the mass ratio and the period to find the total mass.

Wait, let's consider each system separately.

For system_1:

Mass

---------------

 ratio q1 = M1b/M1a = 2.

Total mass M1 = M1a + M1b = 3 M1a.

The

---------------

 velocity amplitude K1a =10 km/s.

Using the formula K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M1b) / ( (M1a

---------------

 + M1b)^(2/3) P1^(1/3) )

Substituting M1b=2 M1a, M1a + M1b=3 M1a, P1=2.



---------------

So,

10 = (2π G)^(1/3) * (2 M1a) / ( (3 M1a)^(2/3) * 2^(1/3) )

S

---------------

implify the denominator:

(3 M1a)^(2/3) = 3^(2/3) * M1a^(2/3)

So

---------------

,

10 = (2π G)^(1/3) * 2 M1a / [3^(2/3) M1a^(2/3) * 2^(1/3) )

---------------

 ]

Simplify the M1a terms:

2 M1a / M1a^(2/3) )= 2 M1a^(1 - 2/3) )= 2 M1a^(1/3)

So,

10 = (2π G)^(1/3) * [2 M1a^(1/3) ] / [3^(2/3) * 2^(1/3) ) ]

Combine

---------------

 the 2 and 2^(1/3) in the denominator:

2 / 2^(1/3) = 2^(1 - 1/3) )= 2^(2/3).

So,

10 = (2π G)^(1/3) * [ 2^(2/3) * M1a^(1/3) ] / 3^(2/3)

Multiply

---------------

 2^(2/3) and 3^(-2/3) as (2^2 /3^2 )^(1/3) = (4/9)^(1/3).

So,

10 = (2π G)^(1/3) * (4/9)^(1/3) * M1a^(1/3)

Combine

---------------

 the terms:

(2π G)^(1/3) * (4/9)^(1/3) = (2

---------------

π G *4/9 )^(1/3).

So,

10 = [ (2π G *4/9 ) /

---------------

 M1a ]^(1/3) * M1a^(1/3) ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting

---------------

 tangled. Alternatively, let's write:

10 = ( (2π G) * (4/9) )^(1/3) * (M1a)^(1/3) )



---------------

Wait, perhaps it's better to cube both sides.

(10)^3 = [ (2π G *4/9) * M1a ]

1

---------------

000 = (8 π G /9) * M1a.

So,

M1a = 1000 *9/(8 π G)

---------------

 )= (9000)/(8 π G).

Similarly, for system_2:

Mass ratio q2 = M2b/M2a = 1.5.

Total mass M2 = M2a + M2b = 2.5 M2a.

K

---------------

2a=15 km/s, P2=1.

So,

15 = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M2b) / ( (M2a + M2b)^(2/3) * P2^(1/3) )

Substitute M2b=1.5 M2a, M2a + M2b=2.5 M2a, P2=1.

So,

15 = (2π G)^(1/3) * (1.5 M2a) / ( (2.5 M2a)^(2/3) * 1^(1/3) )

S

---------------

implify denominator:

(2.5 M2a)^(2/3) = (2.5)^(2/3) * M2a^(2/3).

So,

15 = (2π G)^(1/3) * 1.5 M2a / [ (2.5)^(2/3) * M2a^(2/3) ) ]

S

---------------

implify M2a terms:

1.5 M2a / M2a^(2/3) = 1.5 M2a^(1 - 2/3) )=1.5 M2a^(1/3)

So,

15 = (2π G)^(1/3) * 

---------------

1.5 M2a^(1/3) / (2.5)^(2/3)

Again, cube

---------------

 both sides:

15^3 = [ (2π G) * (1.5)^3 * M2a ] / (2.5)^

---------------

2 )

3375 = (2π G) * (3.375) * M2a / 6.25



---------------

Simplify denominator: 6.25 is 25/4.

So,

3375 = (2π G) * 3.375 * M2a * 4/25

Multiply

---------------

 3.375 *4 =13.5; 13.5 /25=0.54.

So,

3375= (2π G) *0.54 * M2a

So

---------------

,

M2a =3375/(2π G *0.54 )

Calculate denominator: 2 * π

---------------

 ≈6.283, 6.283 *0.54 ≈3.399

---------------

.

So,

M2a≈3375/(3.399 π G) → Wait, no, the

---------------

 denominator is 2π G *0.54.

Wait, let me compute 2 *0.54 =1.08.



---------------

So,

M2a=3375/(1.08 π G )

Hmm, now we have expressions for M1a and M2a in terms of G.

M

---------------

1a = 9000/(8 π G )= 1125/(π G )

M2a=3375/(1.08 π G )=

---------------

 approximately 3375/(1.08)= 3125, so 3125/(π G )

Wait, let

---------------

 me compute 3375 / 1.08:

3375 /1.08 = 

---------------

3375 * (100/108) )= 3375 * (25/27)

---------------

 )= (3375 ÷27) *25 = 125 *25=3125.

Yes, so

---------------

 M2a=3125/( π G )

Similarly, M1a= 1125/(π G )

So,

---------------

 the total mass of system_1 is M1=3 M1a=3 *1125/(π G )=3375/(π G )

The

---------------

 total mass of system_2 is M2=2.5 M2a=2.5 *3125/(π G )=7812.5/(π G )

Wait, wait

---------------

, that can't be right because system_1 has a longer period (2 years) compared to system_2 (1 year), but

---------------

 system_1's mass would be larger? Because when P is longer, for the same K, the mass would be larger.



---------------

But according to these calculations, system_1 has a total mass of 3375/(π G ), and system_2 has 7812.5/(π G ), which would make

---------------

 system_2 more massive. But the question is asking how much more massive system_1 is compared to system_2.

Wait, but

---------------

 that can't be right because the numbers suggest system_2 is more massive. But the options are about system_1 being more massive than

---------------

 system_2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck:

For system_1:

We

---------------

 had M1a=1125/(π G )

So, M1=3 M1a=33

---------------

75/(π G )

For system_2:

M2a=3125/(π G )

So, M2=2.5 *3125/(π G )=7812.5/(π G )

So,

---------------

 M1=3375/(π G ), M2=7812.5/(π G )

So

---------------

, M1/M2= (3375) / (7812.5 )= 3375/

---------------

7812.5.

Let me compute that.

3375 ÷ 7812.5 =

---------------

 ?

Well, 7812.5 *0.432=3375. Because 7812.5 *0.4=3125, 0.432 *

---------------

7812.5=?

Wait, 7812.5 *0.4=3125;

---------------

 0.032 *7812.5=250.

So, 0.432 *

---------------

7812.5=3125+250=3375.

So, 3375/7812.5=0.432.

So, M1 is

---------------

 about 0.432 times M2, which is approximately 0.43. So system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2.

Wait

---------------

, but the question is asking by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So, if system_1 is 0.43 times system

---------------

_2's mass, that means system_2 is more massive. So system_1 is less massive than system_2 by

---------------

 a factor of about 0.43. So the answer would be approximately 0.4 times as massive.

Looking at the options:

A) ~0.4

B) ~0.6

C) ~1.2

D) ~0.7

So the

---------------

 correct option would be A) ~0.4.

Wait, but earlier I thought system_1 had a longer period,

---------------

 which might imply a larger mass, but according to the calculations, it's actually less massive. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the

---------------

 way I set up the equations. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for the mass of the system can

---------------

 be derived using the velocity amplitudes and the period.

The formula for the mass function is:

f(M) = (K^3 P) / (241.3)



---------------

Assuming sin i =1 (eclipsing binaries are edge-on, so inclination i=90 degrees).

So

---------------

 for each star in each system, the mass function would be:

f1a = (10^3 * 2) /241.3 �

---------------

� (1000 *2)/241.3 ≈2000/241.3≈8.29 solar

---------------

 masses.

f1b = (5^3 *2)/241.3= (125 *2)/241.3≈250/241.3≈1.036 solar masses.

Wait

---------------

, but this can't be right because the mass function for each star in the same system should relate to each other. Wait

---------------

, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the mass function for each star is:

f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

So

---------------

 for system_1, for star 1:

f1a = (M1b^3 ) / ( (M1a + M1b)^2 )

Similarly, for star 2:

f1b = (M1a^3 ) / ( (M1a + M1b)^2 )

But

---------------

 I'm not sure if this approach will help without knowing the individual masses.

Alternatively, perhaps using the mass ratio.

In system_1, M

---------------

1b =2 M1a → M1a + M1b=3 M1a.

So f1a = ( (2 M1a)^3 ) / ( (3 M1a)^2 ) ) = (8 M1a^3) / (9 M1a^2 ) )= (8/9) M1a.

Similarly, f

---------------

1b = (M1a^3 ) / (9 M1a^2 ) )= (1/9) M1a.

But

---------------

 from the velocity amplitude K, we can calculate f(M):

f1a = (K1a^3 P1 ) /241.3 =

---------------

 (10^3 *2)/241.3 ≈2000/241.3≈8.29.



---------------

So,

(8/9) M1a =8.29 → M1a = (8.29 *9)/8 ≈ (

---------------

74.61)/8 ≈9.326 solar masses.

So M1a≈9.326, M1b=2 *

---------------

9.326≈18.652.

So total mass M1=9.326 +18.652≈27.978 solar masses.

Similarly, for system_2.

In

---------------

 system_2, K2a=15, K2b=10.

So, M2b=1.5 M2a.



---------------

Total mass M2= M2a + M2b=2.5 M2a.

For star 2a,

---------------

 f2a= (K2a^3 * P2 )/241.3 = (15^3 *1)/241.3 �

---------------

�3375/241.3≈14.0 solar masses.

f2a = (M2b^3 ) / ( (M2a + M2b)^2 )

=

---------------

 ( (1.5 M2a)^3 ) / ( (2.5 M2a)^2 )

= (3.375 M2a^3 ) / (6.25 M2a^2 )

= (3.375/6.25) M2a



---------------

=0.54 M2a.

So,

0.54 M2a =14.0 → M2a≈14.0 /0.54 ≈25.926 solar masses.

So

---------------

 M2b=1.5 *25.926≈38.889.

Total mass M2=25.926 +38.889≈64.815 solar masses.

So,

---------------

 system_1's mass is approximately 27.978 solar masses, system_2's is about 64.815.

So,

---------------

 the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is:

27.978 /64.815 ≈0.431

---------------

.

So about 0.43 times, which is approximately 0.4. So the correct answer is option A.


---------------



To determine how much more massive system_1 is compared to system_2, we analyze the given data:

### Key Observations:
1. **System Parameters

---------------

**:
   - **System_1**: Period \( P_1 = 2 \, \text{years} \), radial velocity amplitudes \( K_{1a} = 10 \, \text{km/s} \), \( K_{1b} = 5 \, \text{km/s} \).
   - **System_2**: Period \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{year} \), radial velocity amplitudes \( K_{2a} = 15 \, \text{km/s} \), \( K_{2b} = 10 \, \text{km/s} \).

2. **Mass Ratios**:
   - In

---------------

 a binary system, the velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses of the stars. Thus:
     \[
     \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_2}{M_1}
     \]
   - For system_1:
     \[
     \frac{K_{1a}}{K_{1b}} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \implies \frac{M_{1b}}{M_{1a}} = 2 \implies M_{1b} = 2 M_{1a}
     \]
     Total mass of system_1:
     \[
     M_1 = M_{1a} + M_{1b} = M_{1a} + 2 M_{1a} = 3 M_{1a}
     \]
   - For system_2:
     \[
     \frac{K_{2a}}{K_{2b}} = \frac{15}{10} = 1.5 \implies \frac{M_{2b}}{M_{2a}} = 1.5 \implies M_{2b} = 1.5 M_{2a}
     \]
     Total mass of system_2:
     \[
     M_2 = M_{2a} + M_{2b} = M_{2a} + 1.5 M_{2a} = 2.5 M_{2a}
     \]

3. **Mass Function**:
   The mass function relates the velocity amplitude \( K \), period \( P \), and total

---------------

 mass \( M \). For eclipsing binaries (edge-on orbits, \( \sin i = 1 \)):
   \[
   f(M) = \frac{K^3 P}{241.3}
   \]
   Using

---------------

 this, the total masses of the systems are calculated.

### Calculations:
- **System_1**:
  - For

---------------

 \( K_{1a} = 10 \, \text{km/s} \), \( P_1 = 2 \, \text{years} \):
    \[
    f(M_1) = \frac{10^3 \cdot 2}{241.3} \approx 8.29 \, M_\odot
    \]
  - Using

---------------

 \( M_1 = 3 M_{1a} \), the mass function gives \( M_{1a} \approx 9.326 \, M_\odot \). Thus:
    \[
    M_1 = 3 M_{1a} \approx 27.978 \, M_\odot
    \]

- **System_2**:
  - For \( K_{2a} = 15 \, \text{km/s} \), \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{year} \):
    \[
    f(M_2) = \frac{15^3 \cdot 1}{241.3} \approx 14.0 \, M_\odot
    \]
  - Using \( M_2 = 2.5 M_{2a} \), the mass function gives \( M_{2a} \approx 25.926 \, M_\odot \). Thus:
    \[
    M_2 = 2.5 M_{2a} \approx 64.815 \, M_\odot
    \]

### Comparison:
The ratio of the total masses is:
\[
\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{27.978}{64.815} \approx 0.431
\]
Thus, system_1 is approximately **0.4 times more massive** than system_2.

### Final Answer:
The factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is **~0.4**.
