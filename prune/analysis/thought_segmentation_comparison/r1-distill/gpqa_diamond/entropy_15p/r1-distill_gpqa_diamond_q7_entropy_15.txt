Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I remember

---------------

 that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, and it fills the universe. The question is about the energy at which the lifetime of a gamma-ray is limited by this annihilation process into electron-positron pairs.

Wait

---------------

, the process given is γγ → e+ e-. So a gamma-ray photon (high energy) colliding with a CMB photon (low energy) produces an electron and a positron. I

---------------

 think this is a pair production process. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

The problem gives the average photon energy of the CMB as 1e-3 eV. So

---------------

 the CMB photons are low-energy. The gamma-rays in question are high-energy, so when they interact with these low-energy photons, there

---------------

's a chance for annihilation, but what determines the energy where this process becomes significant?

I remember that for pair production to happen, the combined energy of the two photons must be at least equal

---------------

 to the rest mass energy of the electron (and positron), which is about 2 * 0.511 MeV,

---------------

 so around 1.022 MeV. Wait, but wait. No, actually, each electron is 0.511 MeV, so the

---------------

 total energy needed is 2 * 0.511 = 1.022 MeV. But this

---------------

 is in the center-of-momentum frame, right?

But wait, in the lab frame where one photon is the CMB photon (

---------------

low energy) and the other is the high-energy gamma, the condition for pair production is a bit different. Because the two

---------------

 photons need to have enough energy together, but their energies in the same frame must sum to at least the threshold energy. So

---------------

 I think the formula involves the product of their energies, but I'm not sure.

I think the threshold condition for pair production is

---------------

 that the sum of the energies in the center-of-mass frame is at least 2m_e c². But in

---------------

 the lab frame where one photon is much higher energy than the other, the condition becomes that the product of the photon energies is

---------------

 greater than (m_e c²)^2 / 4. Or wait, maybe it's that the product is greater than (m_e c²)^2.

---------------

 I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me think. The pair production from two photons requires that the combined energy in their center-of-mass frame is at least twice

---------------

 the electron rest mass. So the condition is that the invariant mass s is greater than or equal to (2m_e c²)^2. The invariant mass squared s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2, but since the

---------------

 photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite. So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (|

---------------

p1| c + |p2| c)^2. But for photons, E = |p| c, so |

---------------

p| = E/(c). So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 + E2)^2 (

---------------

since both momenta are opposite directions, their sum is E1 + E2 for the magnitude, but the vector sum would

---------------

 be E1 - E2? Wait, no, wait. If the two photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta vectors are opposite

---------------

. So the total momentum is E1/(c) - E2/(c) in magnitude. So the invariant mass squared is

---------------

 (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 c^2, but wait, no

---------------

, units get a bit messy. Let me think in terms of units where c=1.

So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 - p2)^2.

---------------

 But E1 = |p1|, E2 = |p2|. So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E

---------------

1 - E2)^2. Let's expand that:

(E1 + E2)^2 = E1² + 2 E1 E2 + E2²


---------------

(E1 - E2)^2 = E1² - 2 E1 E2 + E2²
Subtracting gives

---------------

 s = 4 E1 E2.

So the condition for pair production is that s ≥ (2 m_e c²)^2.

---------------

 Since s = 4 E1 E2, the threshold condition is 4 E1 E2 = (2 m_e c²)^2 →

---------------

 E1 E2 = (m_e c²)^2.

Wait, no. Let me double-check. Because s is

---------------

 (sum E)^2 - (sum p c)^2. Since photons have E = pc, then for two photons moving in opposite directions, sum

---------------

 p is (p1 - p2) in magnitude. So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 - p2)^2 c². But

---------------

 E1 = p1 c and E2 = p2 c, so s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2.

---------------

 Let me compute that:

(E1 + E2)^2 = E1² + 2 E1 E2 + E2²
(E1 - E2)^2 = E1² - 2 E1 E2 + E2²
So s = [E1² + 2 E1 E2 + E2²] - [E1² - 2 E1 E2 + E2²] = 4 E1 E2.

Ah

---------------

, right. So s = 4 E1 E2. The threshold condition is s ≥ (2 m_e c²)^2 →

---------------

 4 E1 E2 ≥ (2 m_e c²)^2 → E1 E2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2.

So E

---------------

1 E2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2.

But in the problem, E2 is the CMB photon's

---------------

 energy, which is about 1e-3 eV. Let me note E2 = 1e-3 eV. Let

---------------

 me compute m_e c^2. The electron rest mass is about 0.511 MeV, which is 511,000 eV. So m_e c² = 0.511 MeV = 5.11e5 eV.

So the

---------------

 condition is E1 * E2 ≥ (5.11e5 eV)^2.

We can solve for E1.

---------------

 E1 ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / E2.

So E1 ≥ (5.11e5 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) =

---------------

 (5.11e5)^2 / 1e-3 eV.

Calculating that: (5.11e5)^2 = (5.11)^2 * 1e10 →

---------------

 5.11^2 is about 26.11, so 26.11e10 e

---------------

V². Dividing by 1e-3 eV gives 26.11e13 eV.

Wait, that

---------------

's 2.611e14 eV. Hmm, but that's 261.1 Ge

---------------

V. But the options are all in the 1e5 GeV range, which is 1e5 GeV = 1e8 eV.

---------------

 Wait, no, wait: 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. So 1e5 GeV is 1e14 eV.

Wait, wait

---------------

. Let me double-check the units. Let's compute (5.11e5 eV)^2 = (5.11e5)^2 (

---------------

eV)^2 = 26.11e10 (eV)^2.

Then E1 ≥ (26.11e10 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) ) = 26.11e13 eV.



---------------

So 26.11e13 eV is 2.611e14 eV. Because

---------------

 1e14 eV is 1e5 GeV (since 1 GeV is 1e9 eV →

---------------

 1e14 eV = 1e5 GeV). So 2.611e14 eV = 2.611e5 GeV.

---------------

 Wait, no, wait:

Wait, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. So 1e5 GeV is 1e14 eV. So 2.611e14 eV is 261.1 GeV,

---------------

 which is 2.611e2 GeV. But that's not matching the options. The options are A

---------------

)9.5e4 GeV, which is 9.5e4 GeV = 9.5e13 eV.

---------------

 Hmm, my calculation gives around 2.6e5 GeV? Or wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents.

Wait, wait

---------------

. Let me recompute:

(5.11e5 eV)² = (5.11)^2 * (1e5)^2 *

---------------

 (eV)^2 = 26.11 * 1e10 eV² = 2.611e11 eV².

Wait

---------------

, no, wait: 5.11e5 is 511,000 eV. Squ

---------------

aring that gives (511,000)^2 = (5.11e5)^2 = 26.11e10 e

---------------

V². So 2.611e11 eV².

Wait, no, 5.11e5 squared

---------------

 is (5.11)^2 = 26.11, and (1e5)^2 is 1e10. So 26.11e10 = 2.611e11 eV².

Then

---------------

, E1 ≥ (2.611e11 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) ) → 

---------------

2.611e14 eV.

Because 1e-3 eV is 0.001 eV. So 

---------------

2.611e11 / 1e-3 = 2.611e14 eV.

Now

---------------

, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so 2.611e14 eV is

---------------

 2.611e14 / 1e9 GeV → 2.611e5 GeV,

---------------

 which is 261,100 GeV. But looking at the options, the closest is option C) 2.6e5 GeV.

---------------

 So option C is 2.6 * 1e5 GeV, which is 260,000 GeV. So

---------------

 that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me think again. Is the condition E1 E2 ≥ (m_e c^2)^2?

---------------

 Because that's the threshold. So the energy of the gamma-ray must be at least (m_e c^2)^2 / E2.

But

---------------

 wait, let's make sure about the process. Because in the lab frame where one photon is the CMB photon (low

---------------

 energy) and the other is the high-energy gamma, the condition is that their product is above (m_e c^2)^2.

---------------

 So yes, E_gamma * E_CMB >= (m_e c^2)^2.

So, E_gamma >= (m_e c^2)^2 / E_CMB.

Given

---------------

 that E_CMB is 1e-3 eV, m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV,

---------------

 which is 5.11e5 eV.

So (5.11e5 eV)^2 = 26.11e10 eV².

Divided by E_CMB =

---------------

 1e-3 eV gives 26.11e13 eV.

Which is 2.611e14 eV.

---------------

 Which is 261,100 GeV, which is 2.611e5 GeV.

So

---------------

 the gamma-rays with energy above ~2.6e5 GeV would have their lifetimes limited by this process. So

---------------

 the answer should be option C) 2.6e5 GeV.

But wait, looking at the options:

A)9.5e4 GeV =

---------------

 95,000 GeV

B)1.8e5 GeV = 180,000 GeV

C)2.6e5 GeV = 260,000 GeV

D)3.9e5 GeV = 390,000 GeV

So option

---------------

 C is the closest to my calculation.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the energy should be higher because the cross-section is

---------------

 considered? Or is there a factor of 4 somewhere?

Wait, when I derived the condition, I set s = 4 E1 E2 =

---------------

 (2 m_e c^2)^2. So 4 E1 E2 = (2 m_e c^2)^2 → E1 E2 = (m_e c^2)^2.



---------------

So that part was correct.

Wait, but maybe the calculation should be E_gamma = (m_e c^2)^2 / E_photon.

---------------

 Which is what I did.

Yes, that's right.

So the calculation gives 2.6e5 GeV, so option C.

To determine the energy at which the lifetimes of high-energy gamma-rays are limited by their annihilation with CMB photons into electron-positron pairs, we analyze the threshold condition for the process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$. The invariant mass squared, $s$, for

---------------

 two photons is given by:

\[
s = 4 E_1 E_2,
\]

where $E_1$ is the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray and $E_2$ is the energy of the CMB photon. For pair production to occur, the invariant mass must satisfy:

\[
s \geq (2 m_e c^2)^2,
\]

where $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 5.11 \times 10^5 \, \text{eV}$ is the electron rest energy. Substituting $s = 4 E_1 E_2$ into the threshold condition gives:

\[
4 E_1 E_2 \geq (2 m_e c^2)^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad E_1 E_2 \geq (m_e c^2)^2.
\]

Rearranging for $E_1$:

\[
E_1 \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_2}.
\]

The average energy of a CMB photon is given as $E_2 = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$. Substituting $m_e c^2 = 5.11 \times 10^5 \, \text{eV}$ and $E_2 = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$:

\[
E_1 \geq \frac{(5.11 \times 10^5)^2}{10^{-3}} = \frac{26.11 \times 10^{10}}{10^{-3}} = 2.611 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Converting to GeV ($1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}$):

\[
E_1 \geq 2.611 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

This corresponds to approximately $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$. Comparing with the options:

- **A)** $9.5 \times 10^4 \, \text{GeV}$ (

---------------

too low),
- **B)** $1.8 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$ (too low),
- **C)** $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$ (matches the calculation),
- **D)** $3.9 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$ (too high).

Thus, the correct answer is **C**.
