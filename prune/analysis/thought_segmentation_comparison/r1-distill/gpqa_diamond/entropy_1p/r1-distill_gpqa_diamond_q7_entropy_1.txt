Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, and it fills the universe. The question is about the energy at which the lifetime of a gamma-ray is limited by this annihilation process into electron-positron pairs.

Wait, the process given is γγ → e+ e-. So a gamma-ray photon (high energy) colliding with a CMB photon (low energy) produces an electron and a positron. I think this is a pair production process. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

The problem gives the average photon energy of the CMB as 1e-3 eV. So the CMB photons are low-energy. The gamma-rays in question are high-energy, so when they interact with these low-energy photons, there's a chance for annihilation, but what determines the energy where this process becomes significant?

I remember that for pair production to happen, the combined energy of the two photons must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the electron (and positron), which is about 2 * 0.511 MeV, so around 1.022 MeV. Wait, but wait. No

---------------

, actually, each electron is 0.511 MeV, so the total energy needed is 2 * 0.511 = 1.022 MeV. But this is in the center-of-momentum frame, right?

But wait, in the lab frame where one photon is the CMB photon (low energy) and the other is the high-energy gamma, the condition for pair production is a bit different. Because the two photons need to have enough energy together, but their energies in the same frame must sum to at least the threshold energy. So

---------------

 I think the formula involves the product of their energies, but I'm not sure.

I think the threshold condition for pair production is that the sum of the energies in the center-of-mass frame is at least 2m_e c². But in

---------------

 the lab frame where one photon is much higher energy than the other, the condition becomes that the product of the photon energies is greater than (m_e c²)^2 / 4. Or wait, maybe it's that the product is greater than (m_e c²)^2. I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me think. The pair

---------------

 production from two photons requires that the combined energy in their center-of-mass frame is at least twice the electron rest mass. So the condition is that the invariant mass s is greater than or equal to (2m_e c²)^2. The invariant mass squared s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2, but since the photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite. So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (|p1| c + |p2| c)^2. But for photons, E = |p| c, so |p| = E/(c). So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 + E2)^2 (

---------------

since both momenta are opposite directions, their sum is E1 + E2 for the magnitude, but the vector sum would be E1 - E2? Wait, no, wait

---------------

. If the two photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta vectors are opposite. So the total momentum is E1/(c) - E2/(c) in magnitude. So the invariant mass squared is (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 c^2, but wait, no

---------------

, units get a bit messy. Let me think in terms of units where c=1.

So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 - p2)^2. But E1 = |p1|, E2 = |p2|. So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2. Let's expand that:

(E1 + E2)^2 = E1² + 2 E1 E2 + E2²
(E1 - E2)^2 = E1² - 2 E1 E2 + E2²
Subtracting gives s = 4 E1 E2.

So the condition for pair production is that s ≥ (2 m_e c²)^2. Since s = 4 E1 E2, the

---------------

 threshold condition is 4 E1 E2 = (2 m_e c²)^2 → E1 E2 = (m_e c²)^2.

Wait, no. Let me double

---------------

-check. Because s is (sum E)^2 - (sum p c)^2. Since photons have E = pc, then

---------------

 for two photons moving in opposite directions, sum p is (p1 - p2) in magnitude. So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 - p2)^2 c². But E1 = p1 c and E2 = p2 c, so s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2. Let me compute that:

(E1 + E2)^2 = E1² + 2 E1 E2 + E2²
(E1 - E2)^2 = E1² - 2 E1 E2 + E2²
So s = [E1² + 2 E1 E2 + E2²] - [E1² - 2 E1 E2 + E2²] = 4 E1 E2.

Ah, right. So s = 4 E1 E2. The threshold condition is s ≥ (2 m_e c²)^2 → 4 E1 E2 ≥ (2 m_e c²)^2 → E1 E2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2.

So E1 E2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2.

But in the problem, E2 is the CMB photon's energy, which is about 1e-3 eV. Let me note E2 = 1e-3 eV. Let me compute m_e c^2. The electron rest mass is about 0.511 MeV, which is 511,000 eV. So m_e c² = 0.511 MeV = 5.11e5 eV.

So the condition is E1 * E2 ≥ (5.11e5 eV)^2.

We can solve for E1. E1 ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / E2.

So E1 ≥ (5.11e5 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = (5.11e5)^2 / 1e-3 eV.

Calculating that: (5.11e5)^2 = (5.11)^2 * 1e10 → 5.11^2 is about 26.11, so 26.11e10 eV². Dividing by 1e-3 eV gives 26.11e13 eV.

Wait, that's 2.611e14 eV. Hmm, but that's 261.1 GeV. But the options are all in the 1e5 GeV range, which is 1e5 GeV = 1e8 eV. Wait, no, wait: 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. So 1e5 GeV is 1e14 eV.

Wait, wait. Let me double

---------------

-check the units. Let's compute (5.11e5 eV)^2 = (5.11e5)^2 (eV)^2 = 26.11e10 (eV)^2.

Then E1 ≥ (26.11e10 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) ) = 26.11e13 eV.

So 26.11e13 eV is 2.611e14 eV. Because 1e14 eV is 1e5 GeV (since 1 GeV is 1e9 eV → 1e14 eV = 1e5 GeV). So 2.611e14 eV = 2.611e5 GeV. Wait, no, wait:

Wait, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. So 1e5 GeV is 1e14 eV. So 2.611e14 eV is 261.1 GeV, which is 2.611e2 GeV. But that's not matching the options. The options are A

---------------

)9.5e4 GeV, which is 9.5e4 GeV = 9.5e13 eV. Hmm, my

---------------

 calculation gives around 2.6e5 GeV? Or wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents.

Wait, wait. Let me recompute:

(5.11e5 eV)² = (5.11)^2 * (1e5)^2 * (eV)^2 = 26.11 * 1e10 eV² = 2.611e11 eV².

Wait, no, wait: 5.11e5 is 511,000 eV. Squaring that gives (511,000)^2 = (5.11e5)^2 = 26.11e10 eV². So 2.611e11 eV².

Wait, no, 5.11e5 squared is (5.11)^2 = 26.11, and (1e5)^2 is 1e10. So 26.11e10 = 2.611e11 eV².

Then, E1 ≥ (2.611e11 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) ) → 2.611e14 eV.

Because 1e-3 eV is 0.001 eV. So 2.611e11 / 1e-3 = 2.611e14 eV.

Now, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so 2.611e14 eV is 2.611e14 / 1e9 GeV → 2.611e5 GeV, which is 261,100 GeV. But looking at the options, the closest is option C) 2.6e5 GeV. So option C is 2.6 * 1e5 GeV, which is 260,000 GeV. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me think again. Is the condition E1 E2 ≥ (m_e c^2)^2? Because that

---------------

's the threshold. So the energy of the gamma-ray must be at least (m_e c^2)^2 / E2.

But wait, let

---------------

's make sure about the process. Because in the lab frame where one photon is the CMB photon (low energy) and the other is the high-energy gamma, the condition is that their product is above (m_e c^2)^2. So yes, E_gamma * E_CMB >= (m_e c^2)^2.

So,

---------------

 E_gamma >= (m_e c^2)^2 / E_CMB.

Given that E_CMB is 1e-3 eV, m

---------------

_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV, which is 5.11e5 eV.

So (5.11e5 eV)^2 = 26.11e10 eV².

Divided by E_CMB = 1e-3 eV gives 26.11e13 eV.

Which is 2.611e14 eV. Which

---------------

 is 261,100 GeV, which is 2.611e5 GeV.

So the gamma-rays with energy above ~2.6e5 GeV would have their lifetimes limited by this process. So the answer should be option C) 2.6e5 GeV.

But wait, looking at the options:

A)9.5e4 GeV = 95,000 GeV

B)1.8e5 GeV = 180,000 GeV

C)2.6e5 GeV = 260,000 GeV

D)3.9e5 GeV = 390,000 GeV

So option

---------------

 C is the closest to my calculation.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the energy should be higher because the cross-section is considered

---------------

? Or is there a factor of 4 somewhere?

Wait, when I derived the condition, I set s = 4 E1 E2 = (2 m_e c^2)^2. So 4 E1 E2 = (2 m_e c^2)^2 → E1 E2 = (m_e c^2)^2.

So that

---------------

 part was correct.

Wait, but maybe the calculation should be E_gamma = (m_e c^2)^2 / E_photon. Which is what I did.

Yes, that's right.

So the calculation gives 2.6e5 GeV, so option C.


To determine the energy at which the lifetimes of high-energy gamma-rays are limited by their annihilation with CMB photons into electron-positron pairs, we analyze the threshold condition for the process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$. The invariant mass squared, $s$, for two photons is given by:

\[
s = 4 E_1 E_2,
\]

where $E_1$ is the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray and $E_2$ is the energy of the CMB photon. For pair production to occur, the invariant mass must satisfy:

\[
s \geq (2 m_e c^2)^2,
\]

where $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 5.11 \times 10^5 \, \text{eV}$ is the electron rest energy. Substituting $s = 4 E_1 E_2$ into the threshold condition gives:

\[
4 E_1 E_2 \geq (2 m_e c^2)^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad E_1 E_2 \geq (m_e c^2)^2.
\]

Rearranging for $E_1$:

\[
E_1 \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_2}.
\]

The average energy of a CMB photon is given as $E_2 = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$. Substituting $m_e c^2 = 5.11 \times 10^5 \, \text{eV}$ and $E_2 = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$:

\[
E_1 \geq \frac{(5.11 \times 10^5)^2}{10^{-3}} = \frac{26.11 \times 10^{10}}{10^{-3}} = 2.611 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Converting to GeV ($1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}$):

\[
E_1 \geq 2.611 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

This corresponds to approximately $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$. Comparing with the options:

- **A)** $9.5 \times 10^4 \, \text{GeV}$ (too low),
- **B)** $1.8 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$ (too low),
- **C)** $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$ (matches the calculation),
- **D)** $3.9 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$ (too high).

Thus, the correct answer is **C**.
