Okay, so I have this genetics question here about barley cultivars and mutations. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on. So, the problem is about a drought-resistant barley that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene for this compound has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis and found some mutations in the first exon area. The question is which mutation would eliminate the compound.

Alright

---------------

, so the gene's normal sequence is given, and there are four mutants. I think I need to look at each mutant's sequence and see how they differ. The goal is to find which mutation would disrupt the gene's function, probably by causing a premature stop codon or a frameshift, leading

---------------

 to a nonfunctional protein.

Let me look at the sequences. The intact gene starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then the

---------------

 rest of the sequence continues.

Mutant 1: The sequence is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’. Comparing to the intact gene, the

---------------

 first part is a bit different. Let me see: the original starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT... So in mutant 1, maybe the first

---------------

 few nucleotides are changed. Wait, looking at the exact positions. Let me write down the original and mutant 1.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGT … TGA
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGC … TGA

Wait, so

---------------

 the first part: original has TTT, then CTC. Mutant1 has TTC TAC. So, the first part

---------------

 is changing from TTTCTC to TTCTAC. Wait, but how does that affect the amino acids?

Let's translate the

---------------

 original and mutant1 sequences into amino acids to see if there's a change early on.

Original starts: ATG is methionine. Then TTT is phenylalanine, CTC is leucine. So, Met, Phe, Leu...

Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC. TTC is phenylalanine, TAC is tyrosine. So, Met, Phe, Tyr. So, the third amino acid changes from Leu to Tyr. That

---------------

's a substitution. Not a frameshift or a premature stop. So, maybe it's a missense mutation but not causing a stop.

Mutant2: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’. Let's compare. The original after

---------------

 ATG is TTTCTCGCTGGTACT... So mutant2's sequence after ATG is TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...

Wait, so

---------------

 the original is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT. So, positions 4-6: TTT, then CTC, then GCT, etc.

Mutant2: TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT. So, first

---------------

, TTC is phenylalanine, then TAA is tyrosine? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the

---------------

 triplet after TTC in mutant2 is TAA. So the second codon in mutant2 is TAA, which is a stop codon. Oh, wait, T

---------------

AA is a stop codon, right? Because the stop codons are TAA, TAG, and TGA.

So in mutant2, the sequence is ATG TTC TAA GCT... So the first codon is Met, then TTC is Phe, then TAA is a stop. So the protein

---------------

 would terminate after two amino acids. That's a very early stop, leading to a much shorter protein. So the gene product would be nonfunctional. That would likely disrupt the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound, right

---------------

? So that's a possibility.

Mutant3: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’ Compar

---------------

ing to original.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGT … TGA

Mutant3: ATG TTTT ACG CTT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGT … TGA

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I'm not aligning correctly. Let me look again. The first part of mutant3 is ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCT...

Original: after ATG is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant3: after ATG is TTTT ACG CTT GGT GTC ACT...

Hmm, so the original has

---------------

 TTT CTC GCT. Mutant3 has TTTT ACG CTT. Wait, but that's a

---------------

 longer stretch. Wait, perhaps the first exon has a duplication or an insertion. Let me count the letters.

Wait, the original first

---------------

 part is 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGT…TGA-3’.

Mutant3: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGT…TGA-3’.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 it's better to look at the nucleotides:

Original: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant3: ...TTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

So, in

---------------

 the original, the first part is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT.

In mutant3, it's TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT.

Wait, so the

---------------

 third codon in original is CTC (Leu), but in mutant3, it's TAC, which is Tyr. Then the next codon in original is GCT (Ala), but in mutant3, it's GCT as well? Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I'm getting the positions wrong. Let me line them up:

Original: position 4-6: TTT (Phe)
Positions

---------------

 7-9: CTC (Leu)
Positions 10-12: GCT (Ala)
Positions 13-15: GGT (Gly)
Positions 16-18: ACT (Thr)
...



---------------

Mutant3: positions 4-6: TTT (same as original)
Positions 7-9: TAC (Tyr)
Positions 10-12: GCT (Ala)
Positions 13-15: GGT (Gly)
Positions 16-18: GTC (Val)
Positions 19-21: ACT (Thr)
...

So in mutant3, the second

---------------

 codon is same, then the third codon changes from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr), then the fourth codon is

---------------

 same, the fifth changes from ACT (Thr) to GTC (Val). So, this is a substitution of two amino acids. So, the

---------------

 protein would have some changes but not a frameshift or a stop. So, it might not completely eliminate the compound unless it disrupts the function.

Mutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. Let's compare.

Original: ...TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant4: ...TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, the

---------------

 original after ATG is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant4: after ATG is TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So, let

---------------

 me look at the codons.

Original:
positions 4-6: TTT (Phe)
7-9: CTC (Leu)
10-12: GCT (Ala)
13-15: GGT (Gly)
16-18: ACT (Thr)
19-21: TCT (Ser)
...

Mutant4:
positions 4-6: TTT (Phe)
7-9: TAC (Tyr)
10-12: GCT (Ala)
13-15: ACT (Thr)
16-18: TCT (Ser)
...

Wait, so in the original, the

---------------

 first codon is TTT (Phe), then CTC (Leu), then GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), etc.

In mutant4, the first codon is same, second codon is TAC (Tyr), third is GCT (Ala), fourth is ACT (Thr), fifth is TCT (Ser). So, the fourth

---------------

 codon in the original is GGT (Gly) and in mutant4 it's ACT (Thr). So, that

---------------

's a substitution at that position.

Wait, but looking again, perhaps I'm miscounting. Alternatively, perhaps mutant4 has a deletion or an insertion. Let me compare the lengths. The original sequence

---------------

: from the beginning, it's 21 nucleotides (ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...). Let's count the

---------------

 letters.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to see if the length changes. Original: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’


---------------

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Wait

---------------

, the original has "TTTCTC", which is 6 nucleotides (TTT CTC). Mutant4 has "TTTTAC", which is 6 nucleotides (TTT TAC). Hmm, same length. So no frameshift. Then, the

---------------

 next part: original has "GCT GGT ACT" (GCT GGT ACT) which is 9 nucleotides. Mutant4 has "GCT ACT" which is 6 nucleotides? Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no

---------------

, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the original is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT... So that

---------------

's TTT (3), CTC (3), GCT (3), GGT (3), ACT (3), TCT (3) etc

---------------

.

Mutant4's sequence: TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So, the second codon is TAC, third is GCT, fourth is ACT, fifth is TCT... So,

---------------

 each codon is 3, so same length.

So, in the original, the fourth codon is GGT (Gly), but

---------------

 in mutant4, it's ACT (Thr). So, substitution again. So, the amino acids change but no stop. So, the

---------------

 protein would have some altered regions, but it's still a full-length protein.

Wait, but let me think about the question

---------------

. The goal is to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, the gene is responsible for synthesizing it. If the gene is not functional, the compound won't be made. So, the

---------------

 best way is to disrupt the gene's function. So, a mutation that causes a premature stop would do that. Because the protein won't be made beyond that point.

Looking back at the mutants:

Mutant2 has a stop codon at the second codon. So, after Met and Phe, it stops. So, the protein would be truncated

---------------

. Depending on where the stop is, maybe the protein is nonfunctional.

Mutant1: substitution in the third codon. So, Met

---------------

, Phe, Tyr... The rest is same. So, the protein is longer, but perhaps the function is altered. If it's a critical region, it might disrupt the compound, but if

---------------

 not, maybe not.

Mutant3: two substitutions. Met, Phe, Tyr, Ala, Val, ... So, the

---------------

 protein is longer but with some changes. Possibly less likely to eliminate the compound, unless it's in a critical region.

Mutant4: substitution in the fourth codon. Gly to Thr. So, again, a

---------------

 missense mutation, but no stop. So, the protein is longer.

So, the best bet for eliminating the compound is mutant2, which introduces a stop codon early on.

Wait, but let

---------------

 me double-check. In mutant2, the sequence is ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT... So, the first codon is Met, second is Phe (TTC), third is TAA which is a stop codon. So, the mRNA would be translated into Met-Phe, and then stop. The resulting protein would be very short, just

---------------

 two amino acids. So, the gene product is nonfunctional, and the compound won't be synthesized.

So, the correct answer would be option A) Mutant2.

Wait, the options are:

A) Mutant 2

B) Mutant 3

C) Mutant 1

D) Mutant 4

So, the answer should be A.


To determine which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, we analyze the sequences of the intact gene and the four mutants. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, such as by introducing a premature stop codon or significantly altering the protein structure.

### Intact Gene:
The intact gene sequence is:
```
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
```
This sequence starts with the start codon `ATG` and continues through several exons.

### Mutant Analysis:
1. **Mutant 1**:
   - Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`
   - Comparison: The first codon remains `ATG` (Met), the second codon changes from `TTT` (Phe) to `TAC` (Tyr), and the third codon changes from `CTC` (Leu) to `GCT` (Ala). This is a missense mutation with no frameshift or stop codon. The protein would still be full-length but with some amino acid substitutions.

2. **Mutant 2**:
   - Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`
   - Comparison: The first codon remains `ATG` (Met), the second codon changes from `TTT` (Phe) to `TAC` (Tyr), and the third codon becomes `TAA`, which is a stop codon. This results in a very short, nonfunctional protein (only two amino acids: Met-Phe). The gene product would be nonfunctional, effectively eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.

3. **Mutant 3**:
   - Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`
   - Comparison: The first codon remains `ATG` (Met), the second codon changes from `TTT` (Phe) to `TAC` (Tyr), and the fourth codon changes from `GGT` (Gly) to `GTC` (Val). This is a missense mutation with no frameshift or stop codon. The protein would still be full-length with some amino acid substitutions.

4. **Mutant 4**:
   - Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`
   - Comparison: The first codon remains `ATG` (Met), the second codon changes from `TTT` (Phe) to `TAC` (Tyr), and the fourth codon changes from `GGT` (Gly) to `ACT` (Thr). This is a missense mutation with no frameshift or stop codon. The protein would still be full-length with some amino acid substitutions.

### Conclusion:
The most effective mutation for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound is **Mutant 2**, as it introduces a premature stop codon (`TAA`), resulting in a nonfunctional protein. This disruption ensures that the compound is not synthesized.
