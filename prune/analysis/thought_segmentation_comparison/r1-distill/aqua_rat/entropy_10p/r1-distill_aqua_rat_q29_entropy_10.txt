Okay, so I've got this problem about a jeep traveling a certain distance. Let me try to break it down. Hmm

---------------

, the question is about finding the distance the jeep traveled. Alright, let's read it again.

The jeep takes 6 hours for the forward journey. Then, on the return trip, it increases its speed by 12 km/hr and takes 4 hours. I

---------------

 need to find the distance. Oh right, because the distance going and coming back should be the same, right? So the

---------------

 distance is constant for both trips.

Let me think about the variables. Let's denote the speed during the forward journey as 'v' km/hr. Then, the return journey speed would be 'v + 12' km/hr.

---------------

 

Distance equals speed multiplied by time. So for the forward trip, distance D = v * 6. For the return trip, same

---------------

 distance D = (v + 12) * 4.

Since both expressions equal D, I can set them equal to each other. So v

---------------

*6 = (v +12)*4. Now I can solve for v.

Let me expand the right side: 4v

---------------

 + 48. So the equation becomes 6v = 4v +48. Subtract 4v from both sides: 2v =48. So

---------------

 v is 24 km/hr.

Now that I have v, I can find the distance. D = v *6 =

---------------

24 *6. Let me calculate that: 24*6 is 144. So the distance is 144 km. Looking

---------------

 at the options, option B is 144 km. That must be the answer.

Wait, let me double-check.

---------------

 Return trip speed is 24+12=36 km/hr. Time is 4 hours. So 36*4=

---------------

144. Yep, same as the forward trip. So that's consistent. So yeah, B is correct.


The jeep travels the same distance during both the forward and return journeys. Let the speed during the forward journey be \( v \) km/hr. The distance

---------------

 for the forward journey is \( D = v \times 6 \). For the return journey, the speed increases by 12 km/hr, making it \( v + 12 \) km/hr, and the time taken is 4 hours. Thus, the distance for the return journey is \( D = (v + 12) \times 4 \).

Since the distances are equal, we set the two expressions for \( D \) equal to each other:

\[
v \times 6 = (v + 12) \times 4
\]

Expanding the right-hand side:

\[
6v = 4v + 48
\]

Subtracting \( 4v \) from both sides:

\[
2v = 48
\]

Solving for \( v \):

\[
v = 24 \, \text{km/hr}
\]

Now, calculate the distance using the forward journey:

\[
D = v \times 6 = 24 \times 6 = 144 \, \text{km}
\]

Ver

---------------

ifying with the return journey, the speed is \( v + 12 = 36 \, \text{km/hr} \), and the time is 4 hours:

\[
D = 36 \times 4 = 144 \, \text{km}
\]

Both calculations confirm that the distance traveled by the jeep is 144 km. Therefore

---------------

, the correct answer is:
