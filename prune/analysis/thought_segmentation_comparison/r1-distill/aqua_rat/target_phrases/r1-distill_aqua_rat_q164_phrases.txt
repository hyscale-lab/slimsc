Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest number of identical bouquets I can make using 28 white tulips and 98 red tulips. And I can't leave any flowers out. Hmm, I think this is a problem about dividing things into equal parts without leftovers. Let me think.

So, the question is asking for the maximum number of identical bouquets. Each bouquet must have the same number of white and red tulips. 

---------------

Oh wait, no, wait. 

---------------

Wait, no, the bouquets are identical if they have the same number of red and white tulips. So each bouquet must have the same composition of white and red. So, the number of white and red in each bouquet should be the same across all bouquets.

So, if I can figure out how many bouquets I can make, that would be the maximum number where each bouquet uses a certain number of white and red tulips, and all are used up without leftovers.

Let me think in terms of factors. Because the total number of white and red tulips must be divisible by the number of bouquets. So, the number of bouquets must be a common divisor of both 28 and 98.



---------------

Wait, right! So the maximum number of bouquets would be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 28 and 98. Because the GCD is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. That makes sense.

So, I need to find GCD(28, 98).

Let me calculate that. Let's see, factors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28. Factors of 98 are 1, 2, 7, 14, 49, 98. The common factors are 1, 2, 7, 14. The greatest is 14.



---------------

Wait, wait, so the GCD is 14. So the maximum number of bouquets is 14. 

---------------

But wait, let me check again.



---------------

Wait, 28 divided by 14 is 2. So each bouquet would have 2 white tulips. 98 divided by 14 is 7. So each bouquet would have 7 red tulips. So each bouquet has 2 white and 7 red. That adds up to 9 per bouquet, but wait, that's not necessary for the problem. The key is that all 28 white and 98 red are used.

So 14 bouquets would require 14 *2=28 white and 14*7=98 red. Perfect, nothing left.



---------------

But wait, the options include 14 as option D. 

---------------

But another thought: if the GCD is 14, that's the maximum possible bouquets. 

---------------

But wait, is that correct?



---------------

Wait, another way: let's see what the options are. The options are A)4, B)7, C)10, D)14, E)21.

So, 14 is an option, so that's probably the answer. But let me double-check my GCD calculation.

28 and 98. Let me use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

The Euclidean algorithm says:

GCD(98,28)
98 divided by 28 is 3, remainder 14 (because 28*3=84, 98-84=14)
Now, GCD(28,14)
28 divided by 14 is 2, remainder 0.
So GCD is 14. Yep, that's correct.

So the maximum number is 14 bouquets. So the answer should be D)14.



---------------

Wait, but wait. 

---------------

Another thought: Each bouquet has to have the same number of white and red, but perhaps there's a constraint I'm missing. For instance, can the number of white in each bouquet be more than 2? Let me see.



---------------

Wait, 28 white can be divided into 14 bouquets as 2 each. But what if I wanted to have more bouquets? Let's see. Suppose I tried 21 bouquets. 21 is an option. But 28 divided by 21 is 1.333... which isn't a whole number. So that's not possible. Similarly, 10 bouquets: 28/10 is 2.8, which isn't whole. So 14 is the maximum possible. So yeah, D is the right answer.


To determine the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made using 28 white and 98 red tulips without leaving any flowers unused, we need to find the largest number that divides both 28 and 98 evenly. This is equivalent to finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 28 and 98.

The factors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28. The factors of 98 are 1, 2, 7, 14, 49, and 98. The common factors are 1, 2, 7, and 14, with 14 being the greatest. Therefore, the GCD of 28 and 98 is 14.

This means that the maximum number of identical bouquets is 14. Each bouquet would contain \( \frac{28}{14} = 2 \) white tulips and \( \frac{98}{14} = 7 \) red tulips, using all the flowers without any leftovers.

Thus, the correct answer is **D) 14**.
