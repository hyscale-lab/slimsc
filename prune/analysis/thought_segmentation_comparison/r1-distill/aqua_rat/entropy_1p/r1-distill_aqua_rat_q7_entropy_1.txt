Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the total number of distinct bike numbers. The format is two letters followed by two numbers. Hmm, I think I need to figure out how many possible combinations there are for this setup. 

Wait, the question also asks, how many letters need to be distinct? Oh wait, no, the question is just

---------------

 about finding the total number, but the options are given. Oh, no, wait the actual question is phrased as "Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?" Wait, no, that

---------------

's not quite right. Let me read it again.

Oh wait, perhaps the question is simply asking for the total number, and it's a multiple-choice with the options given. So I can ignore the second part about letters needing to be distinct because maybe that was a typo or something. Or maybe the initial statement is the question, and the options are the possible answers.

Wait, no, looking again: The question is "Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?" Hmm, that wording is a bit confusing. Or perhaps I misread. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the correct question is: Find the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers. How many letters need to be distinct? Wait, no, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the actual question is just to find the total number, and the second part is part of the problem statement. Maybe the question is: Find the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers. How many letters need to be distinct? Or perhaps, is the letters allowed to be the same or must they be distinct?

Wait, the question is a bit unclear. Let me reread it. The question

---------------

 says: "Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?" Hmm, perhaps the actual

---------------

 question is to find the total number, and the second part is part of the problem. Like, how many letters must be distinct when forming the bike numbers.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the structure of the bike number. It's two letters followed by two digits. So, the format is LL NN, where L is a letter and N is a number.

Now, the problem is to find how many such distinct bike numbers can be formed. But the question also specifies, how many letters need to be distinct. So perhaps the letters must be distinct, or maybe they can be the same. Or maybe the problem is whether the letters are allowed to be same or not. Because

---------------

 that affects the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the question is simply asking for the total number of possible bike numbers, regardless of whether the letters are distinct or not. But the options are numbers, so maybe I'm to compute it as if letters can repeat or not. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says "using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s." So, are the letters allowed to be the same or must they be distinct? Because that's crucial for the calculation.

Looking back at the problem statement: The exact wording is "Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?" Hmm, perhaps the way it's phrased is that the letters must be distinct. So, for the letters part, it's permutations where the two letters are distinct.

Wait, but that

---------------

 might not make sense because the question is phrased as a single sentence. Alternatively, perhaps the letters can be the same, and the question is about whether they must be distinct. But that's not clear. Wait, perhaps the question is just

---------------

 asking for the total number without any constraints on the letters. Or maybe the letters must be distinct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the letters must be distinct. Because the question is phrased as "How many letters need to be distinct?" which implies that the letters have to be distinct. So, that's a key point.

So, if the two letters must be distinct, then the number of possible letter combinations is 26 (for the first letter) multiplied by 25 (for the second letter, since it can't be the same as the first). Because

---------------

 the English alphabet has 26 letters.

Alternatively, if letters can be repeated, it would be 26 * 26.

Similarly, for the numbers, each digit can be from 0 to 9, so 10 possibilities for each digit. So, for two digits, it's 10 * 10.

So, the total number of bike numbers would be the product of the letters possibilities and the numbers possibilities.

So, if letters must be distinct, it's 26 * 25 * 10 * 10. Let me compute that.

26 *25 is 650, and 10*10 is 100. So 650 * 100 = 65,000.

Looking at the options, option D is 65000. So that's one possibility.

But wait, what if the letters can be the same? Then it's 26 *26 = 676. 676 * 100 = 67,600. Hmm, but 67,600 isn't one of the options. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A)74453
B)64543
C)74325
D)65000
E)97656

So 65,000 is option D. So if letters must be distinct, that's the answer.

But wait, the question says "How many letters need to be distinct?" So perhaps the question is about

---------------

 whether the letters must be distinct. Or perhaps, the letters can be anything, but the problem is about the total number.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The initial problem is to find the total number of bike numbers, given that they consist of 2 letters followed by 2 digits. So the total number is 26 * 26 * 10 * 10. But wait, no, because sometimes the letters could be the same or not.

Wait, perhaps the question is not

---------------

 about whether the letters must be distinct, but just to compute the total without any constraints. So, that would be 26^2 * 10^2 = 676 * 100 = 67,600. But that's not one of the options. So maybe the letters must be distinct.

So, if

---------------

 letters must be distinct, 26*25 = 650. 650 * 100 = 65,000. Which is option D. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but what

---------------

 if the letters can be the same? Then why isn't 67,600 an option? The options don't include that. So perhaps the letters must be distinct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the letters must be distinct, which leads to 65,000. So the correct option is D.


To determine the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 digits, we analyze the problem as follows:

1. **Structure of the bike number**: The format is LL NN, where L represents a letter and N represents a digit.

2. **Letters**: The English alphabet has 26 letters. If the letters must be distinct, the number of possible combinations for the two letters is:
   \[
   26 \times 25 = 650
   \]
   Here, the first letter has 26 possibilities, and the second letter has 25 possibilities (since it cannot be the same as the first).

3. **Digits**: Each digit can range from 0 to 9, giving 10 possibilities for each digit. For two digits, the number of combinations is:
   \[
   10 \times 10 = 100
   \]

4. **Total combinations**: The total number of distinct bike numbers is the product of the letter combinations and the digit combinations:
   \[
   650 \times 100 = 65,000
   \]

5. **Options analysis**: Among the given options, only **65,000** matches this calculation. Therefore, the correct answer is:
