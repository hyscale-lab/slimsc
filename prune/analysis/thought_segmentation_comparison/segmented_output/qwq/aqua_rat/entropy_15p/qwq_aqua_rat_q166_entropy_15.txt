Okay, so I need to figure out how long it will take both printers working together to print 100 pages. Let

---------------

 me think. Each printer can print 1/2 a page per second. Hmm, right. 

First, maybe I should find out the combined rate of both printers. Since each does 1/2 page per second, together they would add up. So like

---------------

, Printer A's rate plus Printer B's rate. That would be 1/2 + 1/2. Oh, that adds up to 1 page per second. Oh wait, right! Because together

---------------

 they can print one full page every second. 

So if their combined rate is 1 page per second, then to print 100 pages, the time needed would be the total pages divided by the rate. So time equals 100 pages divided by 1 page per second. That would be 100 seconds. Wait, but let me check the options. Option C is 100 seconds. But

---------------

 wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait a second, maybe I confused the rates. Let me go

---------------

 through it again. Each printer does 0.5 pages per second. So together, their rates add. So 0.5 + 0.5 is indeed 1 page per second. So yes

---------------

, the combined rate is correct. Then time is total divided by rate. 100 / 1 is 100. So that would be 

---------------

100 seconds, which is option C. 

But hold on, another way to think about it: If one printer takes 2 seconds per page (since 1/2 page per second means 2 seconds per page), then two printers working together would split the work. But

---------------

 maybe that's complicating it. Let me see. Alternatively, if each printer can do 1/2 page per second, then in one second, together

---------------

 they make 1 page. So for 100 pages, 100 seconds. That seems right. 

Hmm, but

---------------

 I remember sometimes when things are in parallel, like two workers, the time is halved. Wait, but here the question

---------------

 is 100 pages. So if one printer takes 200 seconds (since 100 pages at

---------------

 0.5 pages per second would be 100/(0.5) = 200 seconds). So

---------------

 two printers working together would take half the time, which is 100 seconds. Oh, that also gives the same answer. So yeah

---------------

, that's consistent. 

So the answer must be C) 100 seconds. Let me check the options again. The options are A)25, B)50, C)100, D)200, E)400. So C is the

---------------

 correct one. I don't see any mistake here. Maybe I should think if there's another way someone might get confused. Like maybe adding rates incorrectly

---------------

. But no, adding 0.5+0.5 is 1. So I think the answer is C.


To determine how long it will take both printers working together to print 100 pages, first calculate their combined printing rate. Each printer prints \( \frac{1}{2} \) page per second, so together they print \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1 \) page per second. 

The time required to print 100 pages at this combined rate is calculated

---------------

 by dividing the total number of pages by the rate:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{100 \text{ pages}}{1 \text{ page/second}} = 100 \text{ seconds}.
\]

This matches option C. Cross

---------------

-verifying, if one printer alone would take \( \frac{100}{\frac{1}{2}} = 200 \) seconds, two printers working together would indeed take half the time (100 seconds), confirming the answer.

Answer: C<|im_end|>
