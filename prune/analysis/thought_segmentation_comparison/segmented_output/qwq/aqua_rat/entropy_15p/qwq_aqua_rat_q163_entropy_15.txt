Okay, so the problem is asking for the greatest number of identical bouquets we can make using 28 white tulips and 98 red tulips, with none left over. Hmm, right. The key here is that each bouquet has to be identical, meaning each bouquet must have the same number of white and red tulips. And we can't have any flowers left, so all 28 white and 98 red must be used exactly.

I

---------------

 think this is a greatest common divisor (GCD) problem. Because the GCD of the two numbers (28 and 98) would tell us the largest number of bouquets we can make where each bouquet has the same number of each color. Let me check

---------------

 that thought. 

If we find the GCD of 28 and 98, that should be the maximum number of bouquets. Because the

---------------

 GCD is the largest number that divides both numbers without a remainder. So each bouquet would then have (28/GCD) white tulips and (98/GCD) red tulips. Wait

---------------

, actually, no, maybe the other way around. Let me think again.

Suppose the GCD is N. Then we

---------------

 can divide the white tulips into N groups, each with 28/N white flowers, and the red into N groups with 98/N red flowers. So

---------------

 each bouquet would have those numbers. Since N has to divide both 28 and 98 exactly, the largest possible N is the GCD. That

---------------

 makes sense.

So let's compute GCD of 28 and 98. Let's see, prime factors of

---------------

 28 are 2*2*7. 98 is 2*49, which is 2*7*7. So the common factors are 2 and 7. The

---------------

 GCD is 2*7 =14. Wait, so the GCD is 14? Let me confirm.

---------------

 28 divided by 14 is 2, and 98 divided by 14 is 7. So yes, each

---------------

 bouquet would have 2 white and 7 red tulips. So 14 bouquets total. 

Looking at the options, D is 14, so that would

---------------

 be the answer. Let me check if any other options could work. Let's see, for example, if someone thought the

---------------

 answer was 7 (option B). Then each bouquet would have 28/7=4 white and 98/7=14 red. That

---------------

 works, but since 14 is higher, that's better. What about 21? 28 divided by 21 is less

---------------

 than 1, which isn't possible since you can't have a fraction of a tulip. So 21 is out. Option E is 21, so no. Option

---------------

 D is 14, so that's the GCD. So I think D is correct.


To determine the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made using 28 white and 98 red tulips without leftovers, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 28 and 98. The GCD represents the largest number that divides both quantities exactly. 

Prime factorization of 28: \(2 \times 2 \times 7\).  
Prime factorization of 98: \(2 \times 7 \times 7\).  

The common prime factors are \(2\) and \(7\). Multiplying these gives the GCD:  
\[
\text{GCD}(28, 98) = 2 \times 7 = 14.
\]

This means we can create 14 bouquets, each containing \(28 \div 14 = 2\) white tulips and \(98 \div 14 = 7\) red tulips. All options are

---------------

 checked, and 14 is the largest valid divisor.
