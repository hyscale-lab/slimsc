Okay, so I need to figure out how many of each coin there are in the pouch. The total amount is Rs. 700, and there are equal numbers of 25 paise, 50 paise, and one rupee coins. Hmm, let's think.

First, let me note

---------------

 down what's given. Let the number of each coin be 'n'. So, the number of 25 paise coins is n, 50 paise coins is also n, and the one rupee coins is n too. Since they're

---------------

 all equal in count.

Now, the total value comes from each type of coin. Let me convert everything to paise to avoid dealing with rupees and fractions. Because 1 rupee is 100 paise, right?

So, the value contributed by each type would

---------------

 be:
- 25 paise coins: 25 * n paise
- 50 paise coins: 50 * n paise
- 1 rupee coins: 100 * n paise (since 1 rupee is 100 paise)

Adding all these up should equal the total amount in paise. The total money is Rs. 700, which is 700 * 100 = 70,000 paise.

So the equation would be:
25n + 50n + 100n = 70,000

Let me add those terms. 25 +50 is 75, plus 100 makes 175. So total per n is 175 paise. So

---------------

:

175n = 70,000

To find n, divide both sides by 175. Let me calculate that. 70,000 divided by 175. Hmm, maybe simplify the

---------------

 division. Let's see, 175 times 400 is 70,000 because 175*400 =

---------------

 70,000. Wait, really?

Wait, 175 * 400: 175 * 4 is 700, so 175*400 is 70,000. Yes

---------------

. So n is 400.

Looking at the options, option C is 400. So the answer should be C.



---------------

Wait, let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me plug back in. If n is 400:

25*400 = 10,000 paise (which is Rs. 100)
50*400 = 20,000 paise (Rs. 200)
100*400 = 40,000 paise (Rs. 400)
Total: 100 + 200 +400 = 700. Exactly

---------------

 matches. So yes, that's correct. So option C is the right answer.


The problem states that there are equal numbers of 25 paise, 50 paise, and 1 rupee coins totaling Rs. 700. Let the number of each coin be \( n \). Converting all values to paise:

- 25 paise coins contribute \( 25n \) paise.
- 50 paise coins contribute \( 50n \) paise.
- 1 rupee coins contribute \( 100n \) paise.

The total value

---------------

 in paise is \( 25n + 50n + 100n = 175n \). Since Rs. 700 equals \( 700 \times 100 = 70,000 \) paise, we set up the equation:

\[
175n = 70,000
\]

Solving for \( n \):

\[
n = \frac{70,000}{175} = 400
\]

Verification shows that

---------------

 400 coins of each type sum to Rs. 700. The correct answer is **C)400**.
