Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the question is about calculating the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 in a cab that has a specific pricing structure. The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and then 10 cents for each additional quarter-mile. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, first, I need to understand exactly how the pricing

---------------

 works. The first quarter-mile is $3.50. Then, each additional quarter-mile is 10 cents. Wait, so

---------------

 after the first quarter mile, every quarter mile beyond that costs 10 cents. So the total cost will be the initial fee plus the cost for the additional distance.

Let me break

---------------

 it down. Let's denote the total distance as D. The first quarter mile is 0.25 miles. Any distance beyond that would

---------------

 be (D - 0.25) miles. But since the additional charge is per quarter mile, I need to convert that extra distance into how

---------------

 many quarter miles there are.

So, the extra distance beyond the first quarter mile is (D - 0.25) miles. To find out how many quarter-miles that is, I can divide by 0.25. For

---------------

 example, if the extra was 0.5 miles, that's 2 quarter-miles. So the number of additional quarter-miles is (D - 0.25)/0.25.

Each

---------------

 of those additional quarter-miles costs $0.10. So the total cost for the additional distance would be 0.10 * [(D - 0.25)/0.25]. Then

---------------

, adding the initial $3.50, the total cost equation is:

Total Cost = 3.50 + 0.10 * [(D - 0.25)/0.25]

We need

---------------

 this total cost to be less than or equal to $8.50. Let's set up the inequality:

3.50 + 0.10 * [(D - 0.25)/0.25] ≤ 8.50

Now

---------------

, let me solve for D. First, subtract 3.50 from both sides:

0.10 * [(D - 0.25)/0.25] ≤ 5.00

Hmm

---------------

, let me compute that division. (D - 0.25)/0.25 is the same as 4*(D - 0.25), because dividing by 0.25 is multiplying by 4. Wait, yes

---------------

. Because 1/0.25 is 4. So (D - 0.25)/0.25 = 4*(D - 0.25). So

---------------

 substituting back:

0.10 * 4*(D - 0.25) ≤ 5.00

S

---------------

implify that: 0.4*(D - 0.25) ≤5.00

Divide both sides by 0.4:

(D - 0.25) ≤ 5.00 /0.4

Calculating 5 divided by 0.4: 0.4 times

---------------

 12.5 is 5, right? Because 0.4 *10=4, 0.4*2.5=1, so 12.5 total

---------------

. So 5 /0.4 =12.5. So:

D - 0.25 ≤12.5

Adding

---------------

 0.25 to both sides:

D ≤12.5 +0.25 = 12.75 miles.

So that would be

---------------

 12.75 miles. Looking at the options, option B is 12.75. So the answer should be B?

Wait, let me check my math again to be sure. Let me retrace.



---------------

Starting with total cost:

First quarter mile: $3.50 covers 0.25 miles.

The remaining money after the initial fee is 8.50 -3.50 = $5.00. That

---------------

 $5 is used for the additional quarter miles at 10 cents each.

Each additional quarter mile is $0.10, so how

---------------

 many can you get with $5?

Number of quarters = 5.00 /0.10 = 50. So 50 quarter-miles. Each quarter mile is 0.25 miles, so 50 *0.25 = 12.5 miles.

Adding the initial 0.25 miles gives total distance: 12.5 +0.25 =12.75 miles. Yep

---------------

, that matches. So B is correct.

Let me check if any of the other options could be close. Like D is 14.75, which would require more money. Let me see:

---------------

 14.75 minus 0.25 is 14.5 miles extra. 14.5 divided by 0.25 is 58 quarters. 58 *0.10 is $5.80, plus 3.50 would

---------------

 be 9.30, which is over 8.50. So that's too much. 

So B

---------------

 must be the correct answer.


To determine the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50, start by accounting for the initial fare and the remaining money

---------------

 for additional distance. The first quarter-mile costs $3.50, leaving $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00. Each additional quarter-mile costs $0.10, so the number of additional quarter-miles you

---------------

 can afford is $5.00 / $0.10 = 50. Each quarter-mile is 0.25 miles, so 50 additional

---------------

 quarter-miles equal 50 * 0.25 = 12.5 miles. Adding the initial 0.25 miles gives a total distance of 12.5 + 0.25 = 12.75 miles.
