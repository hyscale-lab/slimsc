Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers. Then the question is asking how many letters need to be distinct. Wait, the

---------------

 options given are numbers like 74453, 64543, etc. Hmm, maybe I mis

---------------

read the question. Let me read it again.

Oh, wait, the question says "Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?" Wait, the

---------------

 wording is a bit confusing. Maybe it's asking, when forming these bike numbers, how many distinct letters are required in total? Or perhaps the

---------------

 question is phrased as "how many letters need to be distinct" meaning that in the two letters part, do they have to be different from

---------------

 each other? Like, do the two letters have to be distinct?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is phrased such that the

---------------

 question is: when forming the bike numbers (2 letters followed by 2 numbers), how many different letters are required in total so

---------------

 that all possible combinations are covered? That might not make sense. Hmm. Wait, maybe the problem is actually a two-part question but

---------------

 presented as a single question here. Let me parse again.

Wait the actual question is "Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?" Oh

---------------

, maybe the question is split into two parts. The first part is to find the total number of such bike numbers, and

---------------

 the second part is asking how many letters must be distinct. Wait, but the options are all numbers. The user probably made

---------------

 a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is: the question is asking for the total number of distinct bike numbers possible, given

---------------

 that the two letters must be distinct, and the two numbers can be anything. Or maybe the question is asking under what condition (

---------------

like letters must be distinct or not), and the answer choices are the total numbers. Wait, looking at the options, the

---------------

 numbers are in the range of like 65,000 to 97,000. Let me think.



---------------

Let me think of possible interpretations. The standard problem like this is: license plates with 2 letters followed by 2 digits. How

---------------

 many possible plates are there if letters can repeat? So letters are 26 each, digits 10 each. So 26 *26 *10 *10 = 26Â² *100 = 676 *100 = 67,600. But none

---------------

 of the options here are that. Wait the options given include 65000 (D), which is close.

---------------

 Hmm. Wait maybe the question is different. If letters must be distinct, then the first letter is 26, second 25. So 26*25 =

---------------

 650. Then digits are 10*10 = 100. So total is 650*100 = 65,000. Which

---------------

 is option D. So perhaps the question is asking for the total number when the two letters must be distinct, and the numbers

---------------

 can repeat. Then the answer would be D)65000. The way the question is phrased is

---------------

 a bit confusing. Let me read the question again:

"Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?"

Wait maybe the question

---------------

 is asking, in the process of forming these numbers, how many letters must be distinct. Like, for the letters part, do

---------------

 the two letters have to be distinct? So the question is perhaps "how many letters must be distinct" (i.e., whether

---------------

 the two letters must be distinct). But the options are numbers, which suggests that the question is actually the first part: find

---------------

 the total number, and the second part is a distractor. Alternatively, maybe the question is a two-part question where the first

---------------

 part is the count when letters can repeat, and the second part when they must be distinct. But the options are given as one

---------------

 set. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased as "how many letters need to be distinct" as in how

---------------

 many letters in the entire system must be available so that the two letters can be distinct. For example, if the letters can

---------------

 be from the English alphabet (26 letters), then the number of letters needed (distinct letters available) is 26. But that's not an

---------------

 option here. Hmm, maybe the question is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is: "how many letters need to be distinct"

---------------

 in the bike number. For example, in the two letters part, do the two letters have to be distinct? So the question

---------------

 is asking whether the two letters must be different (i.e., the requirement is that they must be distinct), and the answer

---------------

 would be that the total number is computed under that condition. So the options are the possible totals, so if the letters must be distinct, then the

---------------

 total is 26*25 *10^2 = 65000, which is D. The

---------------

 other options would be for different scenarios. For example, if letters can repeat, then 26^2*100=67600, which isn't an option here. The

---------------

 closest is D)65000, which would be if letters must be distinct. Since that's an option, perhaps

---------------

 that's the right answer.

Therefore, the question is probably asking for the total number when the two letters must be distinct. So

---------------

 the answer would be D)65000.


To determine the total number of distinct bike numbers formed with 2 letters followed by 2 numbers, we must

---------------

 consider whether the letters must be distinct. The question implies that the two letters need to be distinct. 

- **Letters (

---------------

distinct):** The first letter has 26 options, and the second letter has 25 remaining options (since they must differ). This gives \(26 \times 25 = 650\) combinations.  
- **Numbers (allow

---------------

ing repetition):** Each digit has 10 options, so \(10 \times 10 = 100\) combinations.  

Multiplying these together

---------------

:  
\[
26 \times 25 \times 10 \times 10 = 650 \times 100 = 65,\!000.
\]  

This matches option **D**. Other

---------------

 options do not align with the calculation when requiring distinct letters.  

Answer: D<|im_end|>
