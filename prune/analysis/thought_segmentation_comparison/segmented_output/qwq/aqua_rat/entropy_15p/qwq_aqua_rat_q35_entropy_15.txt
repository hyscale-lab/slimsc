Okay, so I need to figure out how far A is from home after those movements. Let me visualize this step by step. Let

---------------

's start by breaking down each movement.

First, A goes 3 km south. Then 5 km east. Then 3 km north, and finally 2 km west. Hmm. Maybe I should draw a coordinate system. Let me set up the starting point as the origin (0,0). 

South would be the negative y-direction. So after going 3 km south, the coordinates would be (0, -3). Then moving east (positive x-direction) 5 km would take them to (5, -3). Next, moving north 3 km. North is positive y, so adding 3 to the y-coordinate. That would bring the y back to (5, 0), because -3 +3 is 0. Then the last move is 2 km west, which is subtracting 2 from the x-coordinate. So 5-2=3. So final

---------------

 position is (3,0). 

So from the origin (0,0) to (3,0), that's 3 km east. So the distance from home is 3 km. Wait, but let me check again. Let

---------------

 me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting at (0,0). South 3 km: (0, -3). East 5: x becomes 5, y stays -3. Then north 3: so

---------------

 y goes from -3 to 0. Then west 2: x is 5-2=3. Yep. So final

---------------

 position (3,0). So the distance from home is 3 km. The answer should be A)3km. But

---------------

 wait, looking at the options, option A is 3km. So that's the answer. Hmm, but wait,

---------------

 maybe I messed up directions. Let me think again. 

Wait, sometimes people get confused with north/south and east/west. Let me confirm:

---------------

 moving south decreases the y-coordinate, but in my setup, I considered the origin as home. So starting at (0,0). South

---------------

 3 is (0, -3). Then east adds to x, so (5, -3). Then north 3 would

---------------

 add 3 to y: -3 +3 is 0, so (5,0). Wait, wait, no

---------------

! Wait, no. Wait, the third step is moving north 3 km from (5, -3). So the

---------------

 y-coordinate was -3. Adding 3 gives 0. So now the position is (5, 0). Then moving west 2 km subtract

---------------

s 2 from x, so 5-2=3. So (3,0). So from (0,0) to (3,0) is 3 km east. So yes

---------------

, 3 km. So the answer is A. 

Alternatively, maybe someone might think that the north and south cancel each other. The total north-south movement: 3 km south and then 3 km north, so they cancel, ending up at the same latitude as start. Then the east and west: 5 east and 2 west, so net 3 east. So displacement

---------------

 is 3 km east. So distance is 3 km. So answer A. That seems right. So I think the correct answer is option A.


To determine how far A is from home, we analyze each movement step by step using a coordinate system where the starting point (home) is the origin (0,0):

1. **South 3 km**: Moves to (0, -3).
2. **East 5 km**: Moves to (5, -3).
3. **North 3 km**: Moves to (5, 0) (since moving north cancels the initial southward movement).
4. **West 2 km**: Moves to (3, 0) (subtract

---------------

ing 2 from the x-coordinate).

The final position is (3, 0), which is 3 km east of the origin. Thus, A is **3 km** from home.

Answer: A)3km

Answer: A<|im_end|>
