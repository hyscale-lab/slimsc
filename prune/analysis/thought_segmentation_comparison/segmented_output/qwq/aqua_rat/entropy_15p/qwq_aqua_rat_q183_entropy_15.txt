Okay, let's see. The problem says a number is as much greater than 36 as it is less than 86. Hmm, I need to find that number. Alright, so let me try

---------------

 to understand what this means. 

So the number, let's call it x, is greater than 36 by some amount, and that same amount is how much it's less than 86. Oh right! So the difference between x and 36 should be equal to the difference between 86 and x. Wait, because

---------------

 if it's greater than 36 by a certain amount, then that same amount is how much it's less than 86. 

Let me write that down as an equation. The difference x

---------------

 - 36 should equal 86 - x. Because if x is bigger than 36 by (x-36), then the amount it's less than 86 is (86 - x). And

---------------

 those two are equal.

So the equation is x - 36 = 86 - x. Now I can solve for x. Let me do that.

Adding x to both sides: 2x - 36 = 86. Then add 36 to both sides: 2x = 86 + 36. What's 86 plus 36? Let's see, 80+30 is 110, and 6+6 is 12, so total 122. So 2x = 122. Then divide both sides by 2: x = 61. 

Wait, so the number should be 61? Let me check the options. Option D is 61. Hmm

---------------

. Let me verify. 

If the number is 61, then the difference from 36 is 61-36 =25. And 86 -61 is also 25. Oh

---------------

 yeah, that works. So 25 is the difference in both cases. So that's correct. 

Wait, but let me look at the options again. Let

---------------

 me see if any other options might fit. Let's try another one just to be sure. Let's take option C, 51. 51-36 is 15, and 86-51 is 35. Those aren't equal. How about option A, 60? 60-36=24, 86-60=26. Not equal. Option B, 56: 56-36=20, 86-56=30. Nope. E is 41: 41-36=5, 86-41=45. Definitely

---------------

 not. So yeah, D is the correct one. 

Therefore, the answer must be D)61.


To solve the problem, let the number be \( x \). The problem states that the difference between \( x \) and 36 is equal to the difference between 86 and \( x \). This can be written as the equation:

\[
x - 36 = 86 - x
\]

Solving for \( x \):

1. Add \( x \) to both sides:
   \[
   2x - 36 = 86
   \]
2. Add 36 to both sides:
   \[
   2x = 122
   \]
3. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 61
   \]

Verification:  
- The difference between 61 and 36 is \( 61 - 36 = 25 \).  
- The difference between 86 and 61 is \( 86 - 61 = 25 \).  

Both differences are equal, confirming the solution is correct. Checking other options (A, B, C, E) shows they do not satisfy the condition.
