Okay, so I have this problem here about a jeep's journey. Let me read it again carefully. The jeep goes somewhere and takes 6 hours going there. Then on the way back, it goes faster by 12 km/h and takes 4 hours. They want to know the distance traveled. Hmm, right

---------------

.

Wait, the distance for the forward and return journeys should be the same, right? Because it's going and coming back. So the distance each way is the same. That's

---------------

 probably key here.

Let me think of variables. Let's say the speed during the forward journey is 'v' km/h. Then the return speed would be v + 12 km/h. The time taken forward is 6 hours, so the distance is

---------------

 speed multiplied by time. So forward distance is 6v. 

On the return trip, the time is 4 hours, so the return distance would be (v +12) *4. Since both distances are the same, I can set them equal.

---------------

 

So equation: 6v = 4(v +12). Let me write that down. 

Expanding the right side: 6v =4v +48. Subtract 4v from both sides: 2v =48. Then v =

---------------

24 km/h. 

So the forward speed is 24 km/h, so the distance is 6 *24. Let me calculate that. 6 times 20 is 120, plus 6 times4 is 24, so total 144. So the distance one way is 144 km. The

---------------

 total distance traveled would be twice that, but wait the question says "distance travelled by the jeep"—does that mean the total round trip or just one way? Wait, the

---------------

 options have 144 as an option (B), and 228 which is 144*1.58...

---------------

 Hmm, maybe I need to check the question again. 

Wait the question says "What is the distance travelled by the jeep?" So

---------------

 the total journey would be going and coming back. So total distance would be 144 *2 = 288? Wait but none

---------------

 of the options have that. Wait hold on. Wait the options given are A)126, B)144, C)127, D)228, E)128. Hmm

---------------

, so 144 is there. Wait maybe the question is asking for one way? Because the problem says "distance travelled by the jeep"—maybe

---------------

 the question is referring to one way? Wait, but the problem states "the distance" in the forward journey, but the question

---------------

 is phrased as "distance travelled by the jeep"—so the entire trip? That's ambiguous. Wait, let me check the question

---------------

 again.

Original question: "What is the distance travelled by the jeep?" The journey includes both going and returning. So total distance would be twice

---------------

 the one-way. Wait, but according to my calculation, the one-way is 144, so total is 288. But that

---------------

's not an option. Wait, so maybe I made a mistake?

Hmm, let me go through the steps again. Let me re

---------------

check the equations. Let me set variables again.

Let me denote the distance one way as D. So in the forward journey, time

---------------

 is 6 hours, so D = v *6. Return journey, D = (v +12)*4. So

---------------

 since both equal D, set equal: 6v =4(v+12). Solving:

6v =4v +48 → 2v=48 →v=24. So then

---------------

 D=6*24=144. So that's the one-way distance. But the question says "distance travelled"—

---------------

if it's the total trip, then it's 144*2=288. But that's not an option. The

---------------

 options given don't have 288. Wait, the options given include D)228. Hmm, so

---------------

 maybe I made a miscalculation here. Let me check the problem again.

Wait the problem says "increased its speed by 12 km/h and

---------------

 took 4 hours". So maybe the return journey's time is 4 hours, so the return speed is higher, so

---------------

 the time is less, which makes sense. So my equations are correct. So then the answer must be 144,

---------------

 which is option B. Because perhaps the question is asking for one way? Maybe the wording is ambiguous. Let me read the question again.



---------------

The question says "the distance travelled by the jeep". Since the jeep made a journey there and back, the total distance would be twice

---------------

 the one-way. But maybe the question is asking for the one-way distance. Because the options have 144,

---------------

 but not 288. So perhaps the question is considering the one-way trip as the distance. Wait, the wording is

---------------

 a bit unclear, but in many such problems, when they say "distance travelled" in the context of a round trip, sometimes they might

---------------

 just ask for one way. Wait the problem says "a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey". The wording

---------------

 "certain distance" probably refers to the one-way distance. The question is then asking for that same distance. So the answer is 144, which is B. So

---------------

 I think B is the correct answer. Let me check the options again. Option B is 144. So the

---------------

 answer must be B.


To solve the problem, let's denote the jeep's speed during the forward journey as \( v \) km/h. The distance for the forward journey is then \( 6v \) km (since it took 6 hours). On the return journey, the speed is increased by 12 km/h, making the return speed \( v + 12 \) km/h, and the time taken is 4 hours. Thus, the return distance is \( 4(v + 12) \) km. Since the distance for both journeys is the same, we set up the equation:

\[
6v = 4(v + 12)
\]

Solving for \( v \):

\[
6v = 4v + 48 \\
2v = 48 \\
v = 24 \text{ km/h}
\]

The one-way distance is \(

---------------

 6v = 6 \times 24 = 144 \) km. The question asks for the "distance travelled by the jeep," which likely

---------------

 refers to the one-way distance since the problem mentions "a certain distance" in the context of the forward journey. The total

---------------

 round-trip distance (288 km) is not among the options, but 144 km (Option B) is.
