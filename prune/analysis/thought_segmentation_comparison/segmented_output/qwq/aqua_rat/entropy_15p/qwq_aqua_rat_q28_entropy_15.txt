Okay, so I need to solve this problem about the jeep's journey. Let's see. The question says that the jeep takes 6 hours going somewhere, and on the way back, it goes 12 km/h faster and takes 4 hours. They want to know the distance traveled. Hmm, right.

First, I remember that distance equals speed multiplied by time. So,

---------------

 the distance for the forward journey and the return journey should be the same, right? Because it's going to the same place and coming back. So the

---------------

 distance there and back is the same. That's important.

Let me denote the speed during the forward journey as 'v' km/h. Then, the return speed would be 'v + 12' km/h. The time taken for forward is 6 hours, so the distance is v * 6. For the return trip, the time is 4 hours, so the distance is (v + 12) * 4. Since both distances are the same, I can set them equal.

So the equation would be 

---------------

6v = 4(v + 12). Let me write that down properly. 

6v = 4(v + 12). 



---------------

Now I can solve for v. Expanding the right side gives 4v + 48. Subtract 4v from both sides: 6v -4v =48 → 2v =48 → v=24 km/h. 

So the forward speed is 24 km/h. Then the distance is 24 *6 = 144 km. Wait, but let me check the return trip. The return speed would be 24+12=36 km/h. 36 *4 is 144.

---------------

 Oh, that's the same. So the distance is 144 km. Looking at the options, B is 144. So the answer should be B?



---------------

Wait, let me double-check. Let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let's see:

Original speed v =

---------------

24. 6 hours: 24*6 is indeed 144. Return speed is 36, 36*4 is 144. Yep, that's correct. So the answer is B)144km. That

---------------

's one of the options. The other options: 126, 127, 228, 128. None of those match

---------------

. So I think that's right.


To solve the problem, let the jeep's speed during the forward journey be \( v \) km/h. The distance for the forward journey is \( 6v \) km. On the return journey, the speed increases by 12 km/h, making the return speed \( v + 12 \) km/h, and the time taken is 4 hours. The return distance is \( 4(v + 12) \) km. Since both distances are equal:

\[
6v = 4(v + 12)
\]

Expanding and solving for \( v \):

\[
6v = 4v + 48 \implies 2v = 48 \implies v = 24 \text{ km/h}
\]

The distance traveled

---------------

 is then calculated using the forward journey:

\[
\text{Distance} = 6v = 6 \times 24 = 144 \text{ km}
\]

Verification with the return journey confirms the distance:

\[
\text{Return speed} = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ km/h} \implies 36 \times 4 = 144 \text{ km}
\]

Both calculations yield the same distance, confirming the solution is correct. The correct answer is **B)144km**.
