Okay, so I have this probability problem here. Let me read it again. The question says that events A and B are independent. The probability of A happening is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of A or B occurs is 0.96. I need to find the probability of B occurring. The options are from A to E, with numbers like 0.5 up to 0.9.

Hmm, right. Since A and B are independent, that should mean that the probability of both happening is the product of their individual probabilities. Oh

---------------

 right, the formula for independent events is P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). 

The problem mentions the probability of at least one of them occurring. The formula for that is P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Since they are independent, I

---------------

 can substitute P(A and B) with P(A)*P(B). 

So putting that into the equation: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - [P(A)*P(B)]. 

We know P(A) is 0.6, and P(A or B) is 0.96. Let me denote

---------------

 P(B) as x for simplicity. Then plugging into the equation:

0.96 = 0.6 + x - (0.6 * x)

Let me rearrange that equation. Let's see:

0.96 = 0.6 + x - 0.6x  
Combine the x terms: x - 0.6x is 0.4x. So:

0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4x  
Subtract 0.6 from both sides: 

0.96 - 0.6 = 0.4x  
0.36 = 0.4x  
So x = 0.36 / 0.4  
Calculating that: 0.36 divided by 0.4. Hmm, 0.4 is the same as 2/5, so dividing by 0.4 is multiplying by 5/2. 0.36 * 5 is 1.8, divided by 2 is 0.9. Wait, that would give x as 0.9? But let

---------------

 me check again.

Wait, 0.36 divided by 0.4. Let me do it as decimals. 0.4 × 0.9 is 0.36, so yes, 

---------------

0.36 divided by 0.4 equals 0.9. So x is 0.9. 



---------------

But hold on, that would make the probability of B being 0.9. Let me see if that makes sense. Let me plug back into the original equation to check:

P(A or B) = 0.6 + 0.9 - (0.6 * 0.9)  
Calcul

---------------

ates as: 1.5 - 0.54 = 0.96. Exactly matches the given value. So that's correct. 

Hmm

---------------

, but the options include 0.9 as option E. So the answer should be E? Wait, but I feel

---------------

 like maybe I made a mistake here because 0.9 seems high. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me go

---------------

 through the steps again. 

The formula for the union of two events is indeed P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B). Since they are independent, P(A ∩ B) = P(A)*P(B). So substituting:



---------------

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6*P(B). 

Let me write

---------------

 that equation again:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B)(1 - 0.6)  
Which is 0.6 + 0.4*P(B). 

So subtract

---------------

 0.6 from both sides: 0.36 = 0.4*P(B). 

Therefore, P(B) = 0.36 / 0.4 = 0.9. 

Yes, that's correct. So the answer is E)0.9. 

Wait, but the

---------------

 options given are A)0.5, B)0.6, C)0.7, D)0.8, E)0.9. So E is an option. So

---------------

 that's the right answer. 

Hmm, but I thought maybe the answer would be lower. Let me think if there's another way. Suppose

---------------

 I misunderstood independence? Like, maybe they are mutually exclusive? But no, the question says independent, not mutually exclusive. If they were mutually exclusive, the probability of both would be zero, but that

---------------

's not the case here. 

Alternatively, maybe I made an arithmetic error. Let me check again:

0.96 = 0.6 + x - 0.6x  
So

---------------

 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4x  
Subtract 0.6 gives 0.36 = 0.4x  
Divide 0.36 by 0.4: 0.36 divided by 0.4. 

Well

---------------

, 0.4 times 0.9 is 0.36. So yes, that's correct. 

Therefore

---------------

 the correct answer is E)0.9. So the answer must be E.


To solve the problem, we use the formula for the probability of the union of two independent events. Given that events A and B are independent, the probability that at least one of them occurs is:

\[
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
\]

Since A and B are independent, \( P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) \). Let \( P(B) = x \). Substituting the known values:

\[
0.96 = 0.6 + x - (0.6 \times x)
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
0.96 = 0.6 + x - 0.6x \\
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4x \\
0.36 = 0.4x \\
x = \frac{0.36}{0.4} = 0.9
\]

Thus, the probability that event B occurs is \( 0.9 \).
