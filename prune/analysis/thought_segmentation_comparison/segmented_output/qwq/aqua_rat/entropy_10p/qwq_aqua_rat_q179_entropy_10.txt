Okay, let's see. The question is about the sales revenue of Ace Book Company. Last year, 34% of their sales were from novels. The remaining revenue, which would be 100% - 34% = 66%, came from other stuff. Out of that remaining 66%, a third was from biographies. So I need to find out how many times the revenue from novels is compared to biographies.

Hmm, let me break it down. Let's assume the total revenue is 100 units for simplicity. Then novels are 34 units. The remaining 66 units are split into other categories. The problem says 1/3 of the remaining is from biographies. So biographies would be (1/3)*66 = 22 units. Wait, so

---------------

 novels are 34, biographies 22. The question is asking how many times the novels' revenue is compared to biographies. So that would be 34 divided by 22,

---------------

 right?

Let me do that division. 34 ÷ 22 equals approximately 1.545... So looking at the options, that's closest to 1.5 (option B) or 2.1 (C)? Wait, 1.545 is closer

---------------

 to 1.5, since 1.5 is 1.5 and 2.1 is 2.1. The options given are A)1.3, B)1.5, C)2.1, D)2.5, E)3.1. So the closest would be B,

---------------

 1.5. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let me check again. The remaining after novels is 66%, correct

---------------

. Then 1/3 of that is for biographies. So 66 divided by 3 is indeed 22. So novels

---------------

 are 34, biographies 22. 34 divided by 22 is exactly 1.54545... So approximately, the

---------------

 question says "approximately". The options are B (1.5) and C (2.1). Since 1.545 is closer to 1.5 than to 2.1, the

---------------

 answer should be B?

Alternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the question. Let me read it again: "the revenue from the sale of novels was approximately how many times its revenue from biographies." So novels /

---------------

 biographies. 34 /22 is about 1.545. So the closest option is B,

---------------

 1.5. 

But wait, maybe the remaining after novels is not 66% but 66% of the total? Wait no, the

---------------

 problem says "of the remaining revenue, 1/3 was from biographies." The remaining after novels is 66% of total. So yes

---------------

, that's correct. 

Hmm, so the answer should be B? Let me see the options again. The options are A through

---------------

 E, with B being 1.5 and C 2.1. So 1.545 rounds to 1.5. So B

---------------

 is the right answer. 

Wait, maybe the question is tricky in another way. Let me think again. Suppose the remaining after novels is 66%, and of that, 1/3 is biographies, so 22%

---------------

 as before. The novels are 34% of total, biographies are 22% of the remaining 66? Wait no, 

---------------

1/3 of the remaining (66%) is biographies, so that's (1/3)*66% of total. So bi

---------------

ographies are 22% of total revenue. Then novels are 34% divided by 22% of total, which is 34/22.

---------------

 So that's correct. 

Therefore, the answer is B)1.5. Because 34 divided by 22 is approximately 1.545, which is closest to 1.5. The

---------------

 options don't have 1.55, so between B and C, B is closer. So I think the correct answer is B.


To determine how many times the revenue from novels was compared to biographies, we start by noting that novels accounted for 34% of total revenue. The remaining revenue is 100% - 34% = 66%. Of this remaining 66%, one-third (1/3) was from biographies. Calculating the biography revenue:  
\[
\text{Biographies} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66\% = 22\% \text{ of total revenue}.
\]  
The novels' revenue (34%) is then divided by the biographies' revenue (22%) to find the ratio:  
\[
\frac{34\%}{22\%} \approx 1.545.
\]  
The closest approximation among the options is **1.5** (Option B).
