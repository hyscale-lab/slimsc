Okay, let's see here. The question is about simple interest. So Rahul borrowed 500 rupees at 6% per annum, and we need to find out how much he has to pay after 4 years. Hmm, right. Simple interest formula is I = P * R * T, right? Then the total amount would be principal plus interest.

So first, let me note down the given values. The principal (P) is 500 rupees. The rate (R) is 6% per year, so that's 6/100 which is 0.06. The time (T) is 4 years. 

Calculating the interest: I = 500 * 0.06 * 4. Let me do that step by step. 500 multiplied by 0.06 is... 500*0.06 is 30. Because 1% of 500 is 5, so 6% is 30. Then multiply that by 4 years. 30*4 is 120. So the interest is 120 rupees. 

Therefore, the total amount to pay back would be the principal plus interest: 500 + 120 = 620. Let me check the options. Option C is 620. So the answer must be C. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. 

Wait another way: 6% annually on 500. Each year's interest is 500*0.06 =30. Over four years, that's 30*4=120. Total

---------------

 is 500+120=620. Yeah, that's correct. So looking at the options: A is 750, way too high. B is 700, also higher. C is 620. D is 600, which would be if the interest was 100 per year for

---------------

 4 years, but that's not the case here. So the correct answer is C. Therefore, the answer should be option C.


To determine the amount Rahul will pay to clear the debt after 4 years with a 6% simple interest rate, we use the formula for simple interest:  
\[
\text{Interest} = P \times R \times T
\]  
where \(P = 500\) rupees, \(R = 6\% = 0.06\), and \(T = 4\) years.  

Calculating the interest:  
\[
\text{Interest} = 500 \times 0.06 \times 4 = 500 \times 0.24 = 120 \text{ rupees}
\]  

The total amount to be paid back is the principal plus the interest:  
\[
500 + 120 = 620 \text{ rupees}
\]  

The options provided are:  
A) 750  
B) 700  
C) 620  
D) 600  
E) None of these  

Since 620 matches option C, the correct answer is **C**.
