Okay, let's see. The problem is about a shopkeeper who gave a 20% discount one day and now wants to raise the price back to the original. The question is asking by what percentage he needs to increase the discounted price to get back to the original. Hmm, percentages

---------------

 can be tricky sometimes because the base changes.

Alright, let me think step by step. Let's assume the original price of an item is, say, $100. That might make the math easier. So if the original price is $100 and there's a 20% discount, then the discounted price would be 100 minus 20% of 100. 20% of 100 is 20, so the discounted price is $80. 

Now, the next day, he wants to sell it at the original price again. So he has to go from $80 back up to $100. The question is, what's the percentage increase needed on the discounted price ($80) to get back to $100?

To find the percentage increase, the formula is: ((New Price - Original Discounted Price) / Original Discounted Price) * 100. 

So here, the increase needed is $20 (because 100 - 80 = 20). Pl

---------------

ugging into the formula: (20 / 80) * 100. Let me calculate that. 20 divided by 80 is 0.25. Multiply by 100 gives 25%. So the required percentage increase is 25%. 

Wait a second, so the answer should be option C, which is 25%? Let me double

---------------

-check. If you take 25% of 80, that's 20, so adding that to 80 gives exactly 100. Yep, that works. 

Alternatively

---------------

, maybe some might think it's 20% because the discount was 20%, but that's a common mistake. Because the base changes

---------------

 here. The discount was 20% off the original, but the increase is off the discounted price. So the percentage isn't the same. Like, for example, if you decrease by 50% and then increase by 50%, you don't get back to the original. So

---------------

 in this case, the increase has to be higher than 20% because the base is lower. 

Another way to think algebraically: Let the original price be P. After 20% discount, the new price is 0.8P. Let the required percentage increase be x%. So, 0.8P * (1 + x/100) = P. Solving for x: (1 + x/100) = P/(0.8P) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So x/100 = 0.25 → x=25. Yep, that confirms it again. So the correct answer is C, 25%.


The shopkeeper initially offers a 20% discount on the original price. Let the original price be \( P \). After a 20% discount, the discounted price becomes \( 0.8P \). To return to the original price \( P \), the required

---------------

 percentage increase \( x \) must satisfy:

\[
0.8P \times \left(1 + \frac{x}{100}\right) = P
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
1 + \frac{x}{100} = \frac{P}{0.8P} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25 \\
\frac{x}{100} = 0.25 \\
x = 25\%
\]

Thus, the shopkeeper must increase the discounted price by 25% to restore

---------------

 the original price. The correct answer is **C)25%**.
