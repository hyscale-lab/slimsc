Okay, so the problem is about a shopkeeper who gave a 20% discount on all items for one day and now wants to go back to the original price. The question is asking by what percentage he needs to increase the discounted price to get back to the original. Hmm, right

---------------

, percentage increase from the discounted price back to original. Let me think through this step by step.

Let me start by recalling how percentages work here. Suppose the original price of an item is, let's say, $100. That might make calculations easier. If there's a 20% discount, then the discounted price would be 80% of the original. So 20% off of $100 is $20 discount, so the new price is $80. 

Now, the next day, he wants to sell it again at the original price of $100. So he needs to increase the discounted price ($80) back to $100. The question is, what's the percentage increase needed on the discounted price to reach the original?

To find the percentage increase, the formula is: ((New Price - Old Price)/Old Price) * 100%. Here, the "Old Price" in this context is the discounted price ($80), and the "New Price" is the original ($100). 

So plugging the numbers in: (100 - 80)/80 * 100 = 20/80 * 100. Let me compute that. 20 divided by 80 is 0.25. Multiply by 100 gives 25%. So the required percentage increase is 25%. 

Wait, so the answer should be C)25%? Let me double

-check. Because sometimes people get confused between percentage of the original versus the discounted price. 

Let me see another way. Let's say the original price is P. After 20% discount, the price becomes 0.8P. Let the required percentage increase be x%. So, 

---------------

0.8P multiplied by (1 + x/100) should equal P. 

So, 0.8P * (1 + x/100) = P. Dividing both sides by 0.8P gives (1 + x/100) = 1/0.8. 1 divided by 0.8 is 1.25. Therefore, 1 + x/100 = 1.25, so x/100 is 0.25, so x is 25. Yep, that confirms it. The percentage increase needed is 25%, so option C is correct. 

Another

 example: if the original was $50. 20% off is $10, so discounted price is $40. To get back to $50 from $40, the increase is $10. So 

---------------

10/40 is 0.25, which is 25%. Yep, same result. 

So

---------------

 the common mistake here might be thinking it's 20% because the discount was 20%, but that's not how percentages work. Because the base changes. The discount was 20% off the original, but the increase has to be calculated relative to the discounted price, which is lower. So a 20% increase on $80 would only get you to $96, not $100. Hence, 

---------------

25% is needed. 

Looking at the options, C is 25%, so that's the right answer.


To determine the percentage increase needed to return to the original price after a 20% discount, consider an example where the original price is $100. A 20% discount reduces the price to $80. To return to $100 from $80, the required increase is calculated as:

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{100 - 80}{80} \right) \times 100\% = \frac{20}{80} \times 100\% = 25\%.
\]

General

---------------

izing this, if the original price is \( P \), the discounted price is \( 0.8P \). Let \( x \% \) be the required increase. Solving \( 0.8P \times \left(1 + \frac{x}{100}\right) = P \) gives \( x = 25\% \). Thus, the correct answer is **C)25%**.
