Okay, so I've got this problem here about two trains leaving a station. Train A leaves every 16 minutes and Train B every 17 minutes. The question is asking how long until they both leave at the same time again after they just did so together. Hmm, right. I remember something about least common multiples here. Let me think.

So, when two events happen periodically, the time until they coincide again is the LCM (least common multiple) of their intervals. Because LCM gives the smallest number that both intervals divide into. So for 16 and 17, I need to find LCM(16, 17).

Wait, but what's the LCM of two numbers? Well, LCM can be found by dividing the product of the numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD). So LCM(a, b) = (a*b)/GCD(a,b). 

First, what's the GCD of 16 and 17? Let's see, 16 is 2^4 and 17 is a prime number. Since they don't share any common factors except 1, the GCD is 1. Oh right, because 17 is prime and doesn't divide into 16. So that means the LCM is just 16 multiplied by 17. Let me calculate that.

16 times 17. Let's see, 16*10 is 160, 16*7 is 112, so 160+112=272. So the LCM is 272. That would mean the next time they leave together is 272 minutes. Checking the options, option A is 272. So that should be the answer. 

Wait a second, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me think again. The problem says both trains just left simultaneously. So the next time would be after how many minutes? Since their intervals are 16 and 17, which are coprime (since GCD is 1), their LCM is indeed their product. So yeah, 16*17 is 272. 

Let me check the options again. The options are A)272, B)304, C)190, D)70, E)35. So A is correct. The other options don't make sense. Like 304 would be if maybe I added 16+17 and multiplied by something, but no. 190 is like 10*19? Not sure. 70 and 35 are way too small. So yeah, A must be the right answer.


To determine when Train A and Train B will leave the station simultaneously again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their departure intervals, 16 minutes and 17 minutes. The LCM of two numbers is calculated by dividing the product of the numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD). Since 16 and 17 are coprime (their GCD is 1), the LCM is simply their product:

\[
\text{LCM}(16, 17) = \frac{16 \times 17}{1} = 272
\]

Thus, the next simultaneous departure occurs after **272 minutes**, corresponding to option A.
