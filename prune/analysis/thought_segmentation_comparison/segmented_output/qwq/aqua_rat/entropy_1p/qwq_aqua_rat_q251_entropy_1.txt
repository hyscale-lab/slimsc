Okay, so the problem here is about figuring out how long it takes the worker to cycle to work when they know the driving time and speed. Let me think through this step by step. 

First, the worker drives at 20 km/h and takes 9 minutes. I need to find the time it takes when cycling at 6 km/h. Hmm, right, this is a distance, speed, time problem. The key is that the distance from home to work doesn't change, right? So the distance when driving should be the same as when cycling. 

Wait, the formula I remember is distance equals speed multiplied by time. So, distance = speed × time. 

But the units here are a bit different. The speed is in km per hour, and the time is given in minutes. Oh right, I need to convert the time to hours to match the units. Let me do that first.

So when driving, the time is 9 minutes. To convert that to hours, divide by 60. 9 divided by 60 is 0.15 hours. Then the distance would be 20 km/h multiplied by 0.15 hours. Let me calculate that. 20 times 0.15 is 3. So the distance is 3 kilometers. 

Wait, that makes sense? Let me check: 20 km per hour means in one hour, you go 20 km. So in 9 minutes, which is a quarter of an hour (since 60 minutes in an hour, 9 is like 0.15), so 20 * 0.15 = 3. Yeah, that's correct. The distance is 3 km.

Now, when cycling, the speed is 6 km/h. So we need to find the time it takes to go 3 km at 6 km/h. Using the same formula, time = distance / speed. So 3 km divided by 6 km/h. That would be 0.5 hours. Oh wait, 0.5 hours is 30 minutes. Wait, but 3 divided by 6 is 0.5. So 0.5 hours. 

But the question asks for the time in minutes. So 0.5 hours multiplied by 60 minutes per hour is 30 minutes. So the answer should be 30, which is option A. 

Wait a second, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in converting units somewhere. Let me go through again. 

Original driving scenario: 20 km/h for 9 minutes. 



---------------

Distance = speed × time. The time in hours is 9/60 = 0.15. 20 * 0.15 = 3 km. That's right. 

Cycling: speed 6 km/h. Time needed is 3 km divided by 6 km/h equals 0.5 hours. 0.5 *60 =30 minutes. So yes, 30 minutes. So the answer is A. 

Hmm, but let me check the options again. The options are A)30, B)32, C)35, D)36, E)40. So A is an option. 

Wait, maybe I messed up the initial calculation. Let me see another way. Let's see, if he cycles slower, it should take longer than driving. Since driving is 20 km/h takes 9 minutes, cycling at 6 km/h is slower, so time should be longer. Wait, but 30 is longer than 9, so that's okay. Wait, but 30 is much

---------------

 longer. Let me think again. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the distance. Let me recalculate. 

If the worker drives for 9 minutes at 20 km/h, how far is that?

Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula time = distance/speed. 

Alternatively, maybe think

---------------

 in terms of ratios. Since speed and time are inversely proportional when distance is constant. 

So the ratio of speeds is 20:6, which simplifies to 10:3. Therefore, the ratio of times should be inverse, 3:10. 

Wait, let me explain. Let me denote the driving time as t1 =9 minutes, speed v1=20. Cycling speed v2=6, time t2 is what we need. 

Since distance is same: v1 * t1 = v2 * t2. 

Wait, but the units here: the times here are in minutes, but the speeds are in km per hour. Hmm, maybe that complicates the ratio approach. 

Alternatively, let's write

---------------

 the equation properly. 

Distance when driving: (20 km/h) * (9/60 h) = 3 km, as before. 

Distance when cycling is same 3 km. So time in hours is 3 /6 = 0.5 h, which is 30 minutes. So that's correct. 

Hmm. So the answer is A)30. But wait, why is option E 40? Maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me think again. 

Wait, perhaps I messed up the driving time calculation. Let me see

---------------

: 20 km per hour. So in one hour (60 minutes), he can go 20 km. So in 9 minutes, he goes (20 km)/60 min *9 min = 3 km. That's correct. 

So cycling at 6 km per hour. To go 3 km, time is 3 /6 hours. 3 divided by 6 is 0.5 hours. 0.5 *60 is 30 minutes. So yes, that's right. 

Hmm, maybe the answer is A. So why are there other options? Let me see if the question says "along the same route", so distance is same. The options must have common mistakes. Like maybe someone forgets to convert minutes to hours. Let me see. 

Suppose someone does 20 km/h for 9 minutes. They might incorrectly calculate distance as 20 *9 = 180, but that would be wrong because the time isn't in hours. So if someone did that, then the distance would be 180 km, which would be way off. Then cycling at 6 km/h, time would be 180/6 =30 hours, which is 1800 minutes, which is not an option. 

Alternatively, maybe someone thought to use the ratio approach but messed up. Let's see. 

The speed ratio is 20:6 = 10:3. Since time is inversely proportional, the time ratio would be 3:10. So driving time is 9, so cycling time would be (3/10)* driving time? Wait no, the ratio would be (

---------------

v1/v2) = (t2/t1). Because distance is same, so v1 t1 = v2 t2 → t2 = (v1 /v2) * t1. 

Ah, right. So t2 = (20 /6) * 9 minutes. Let me calculate that. 20 divided by 6 is (10/3). So 10/3 multiplied by 9 is (10*9)/3 = 30. So that's the same answer. So that's another way to get 30. 

So the answer is 30, option A. 

Hmm, okay I think that's solid. The answer must be A.


To determine the time it takes to cycle to work, first calculate the distance using the driving details. The worker drives at 20 km/h for 9 minutes. Converting 9 minutes to hours:  
\[
\text{Time (hours)} = \frac{9}{60} = 0.15 \text{ hours}
\]  
The distance is then:  
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \, \text{km/h} \times 0.15 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{km}
\]  

Next, calculate the cycling time using the same distance (3 km) and a cycling speed of 6 km/h:  
\[
\text{Time (hours)} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{3 \, \text{km}}{6 \, \text{km/h}} = 0.5 \, \text{hours}
\]  
Convert this time back to minutes:  
\[
0.5 \, \text{hours} \times 60 \, \text{minutes/hour} = 30 \, \text{minutes}
\]  

The answer is **30 minutes**, corresponding to option **A**.
