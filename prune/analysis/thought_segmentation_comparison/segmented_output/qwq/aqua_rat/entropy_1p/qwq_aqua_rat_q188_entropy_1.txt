Okay, so the problem is about distributing ten lime soda bottles between two groups of five customers each. Hmm, I need to figure out how many ways this can be done. Let me think step by step.

First, the question is about dividing the bottles into two groups of five each. Wait, but are the groups distinguishable? Like, does it matter which group is which? The problem says "two different groups," so maybe the order matters here. Or perhaps not. Let me see.

If the groups are considered different, then maybe the total number is the combination of 10 choose 5, but then divided by something if they are indistinct. Wait, no. Wait, if the two groups are different (like one is group A and group B), then the number would be C(10,5). But if they are indistinct, then you have to divide by 2 to avoid double-counting. But the problem says "two different groups of customers consisting of 5 members each." Hmm. The wording says "different groups" so maybe they are considered distinct. Wait

---------------

, maybe the groups are different because they are different customers, so each group is a specific set. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is just

---------------

 about partitioning the bottles into two groups of five each. Since the bottles are identical, or are they? Wait, wait, the problem says "ten lime soda bottles on a table." Are the bottles distinguishable? The problem doesn't specify that the bottles are different, so maybe they are identical. Wait, but when you distribute identical items into groups, the problem becomes different than if they are distinct. Wait, the problem says "create these 2 groups." So

---------------

 maybe the groups are of customers, not the bottles. Wait, maybe I misread the problem.

Wait, let me read the question again carefully. The question says: "They are to be served among two different groups of customers consisting of 5 members each. How many ways are there to create these 2 groups?" Oh, wait, the groups

---------------

 are the groups of customers. So the question is, how many ways to divide the ten bottles between two groups, each group having five customers. Wait, but the customers are in groups. Wait, perhaps the problem is that there are ten customers divided into two groups of five each. Wait, no, the problem says "ten lime soda bottles on a table in a restaurant. They are to be served among two different groups of customers consisting of 5 members each."

Wait, maybe the question

---------------

 is that there are two groups of customers, each group has 5 members, and the ten bottles are to be distributed among them. Each group gets some number of bottles? Or each customer gets one bottle? Wait, the wording is a bit unclear. Let me parse it again.

The question says: "There are ten lime soda bottles on a table in a restaurant. They are to be served among two different groups of customers consisting of 5 members each. How many ways are there to create these 2 groups?"

Hmm, perhaps the key is that the groups are being created from the customers, and the soda bottles are being divided between them. Wait, maybe the groups are the groups of customers, and the problem is to split the ten bottles into two groups of five each to serve each group. But the problem says "create these 2 groups" â€” so maybe the groups are the groups of customers, and the question is how to split the ten customers into two groups of five each. Wait, but the problem states that the two groups each consist of five members. So perhaps the customers are being divided into two groups of five, and each group gets some number of bottles. Wait, but the question is about creating the groups. Maybe the groups are the customer groups, and the question is how many ways to divide the customers into two groups of five each. But the problem mentions the soda bottles. Wait, perhaps the soda

---------------

 bottles are being assigned to the customers? Like each customer gets a bottle? Wait, but there are ten bottles and two groups of five each (so total 10 customers?), so each customer gets exactly one bottle. But then the question is about creating

---------------

 the groups of customers, not the distribution of the bottles. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the ten bottles are to be divided between the two groups (each group being

---------------

 five customers), so each group gets some number of bottles, but the question is about how to split the bottles between the two groups. But since the groups are different, perhaps each bottle can go to either group. Wait, but the groups are fixed in size (each group has five members). Wait, perhaps the problem is that the groups are the

---------------

 groups of customers, and we need to divide the ten bottles between them. But the problem says "create these 2 groups", which makes me think that the groups are being formed, not the distribution of the bottles. Maybe the groups of customers are to be formed, and each group has five members, but the question is how many ways to split the customers into two groups of five. But where do the bottles come in? Wait, maybe the ten bottles are the customers? That doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the ten bottles are to be distributed to the two groups, each group consisting of five members (so each group has five people, each person gets one bottle?), but the question is about how many ways to distribute the bottles. But then each group must have five bottles. Wait, that's possible. Let me think again.

The problem says: "ten lime soda bottles on a table in a restaurant. They are to be served among two different groups of customers consisting of 5 members each. How many ways are there to create these 2 groups?"

Ah, perhaps the "create these 2 groups" refers to forming the two groups of customers, each with five members, from a larger set of customers. But the problem doesn't mention how many customers there are in total. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, maybe the groups are being formed from the ten bottles? That can't be. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem entirely.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about partitioning the ten bottles into two groups of five each, and the groups are for the customers. Since the groups are different (two different groups), then the number of ways is the combination of 10 choose 5, since you choose 5 bottles for the first group, and the remaining 5 go to the second group. But since the groups are different, you don't divide by 2. So that would be 252 ways. But 

---------------

10 choose 5 is 252. But the options include D)252. However, let me check the options again. The options are A)90, B)105, C)126, D)252, E)525.

Wait, but if the groups are considered indistinct, then you divide by 2, so 252/2 = 126. But the problem says "two different groups of customers", so they are distinguishable. So the answer would be 252, which is option D. But let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the customers are being divided into groups, and the question is about splitting the customers. Wait, but the problem says there are ten bottles, not ten customers. Wait, the problem says the two groups each have five members. So total of ten customers? So the question is, if there are ten customers, divided into two groups of five each, how many ways? But then the bottles are just there, maybe each customer gets one bottle, but the problem is about forming the groups. The

---------------

 question says "create these 2 groups", so perhaps it's about the customers. But then the bottles are irrelevant? That seems odd. The

---------------

 problem might have a wording issue.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the ten bottles are to be divided between the two groups. Each group has five members, so maybe each member gets one bottle. So distributing ten bottles to ten customers (5 in each group) would be 10!/(5!5!) ways, which is 252. That would be the same as 10 choose 5. Since each group must have exactly five bottles, so choosing which five go to the first group. So the answer would be 252 (D).

Alternatively, if the groups are indistinct, then divide by 2, giving 126. But the problem says "two different groups of customers", which suggests that the groups are distinct (like group A and group B). So the answer should be 252, so D.

But let me check another angle. Suppose that the groups are considered

---------------

 the same. Then the answer is 126. But the problem says "different groups", so the order matters. So 252. Hmm

---------------

. The problem's exact wording is "two different groups of customers". So the groups are distinct. For example, if one group is at table A and another at table B, then the assignment is different. So then the number is C(10,5) = 252, so D.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the

---------------

 customers. Suppose there are more customers, but the question is to choose two groups of five each from some number of customers, but the problem mentions bottles. Hmm. The

---------------

 problem's wording is a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the ten bottles are to be served to the two groups, each group consisting

---------------

 of five members (so each group has five people, each person gets a bottle?), so distributing the ten bottles into two groups of five each. Since the groups are different, the number is 10 choose 5, which is 252. So D is the answer. That must be it.


To determine the number of ways to divide ten lime soda bottles into two groups of five each for two different groups of customers, we consider the problem as selecting 5 bottles out of 10 for the first group, with the remaining 5 automatically assigned to the second group. Since the groups are distinct ("two different groups"), we do not need to divide by 2 to account for indistinguishability. The number of ways is given by the combination formula \( \binom{10}{5} \).

Calculating \( \binom{10}{5} \):
\[
\binom{10}{5} = \frac{10!}{5! \cdot 5!} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 252
\]

The correct answer is **D)252**, as the groups are distinguishable and the calculation directly applies the combination formula without further adjustments.
