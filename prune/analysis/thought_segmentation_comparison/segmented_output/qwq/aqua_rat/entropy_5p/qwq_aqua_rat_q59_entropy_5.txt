Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again. The question says that the sum of five consecutive two-digit odd numbers, when divided by 10, becomes a perfect square. And I need to figure out which of the options could be one of those five numbers. The options are A)47, B)91, C)41, D)67, E)44.

Hmm, first, let me break down what's given. The numbers are five consecutive two-digit odd numbers. So they must be like n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8, right? Because consecutive odd numbers increase by 2 each time. So

---------------

 the five numbers would form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2. 

The sum of these five numbers divided by 10 is a perfect square. Let me write that out mathematically. Let the first number be x. Then the numbers are x, x+2, x+4, x+6, x+8. The sum would be x + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6) + (x+8). Adding those up: that's 5x + (2+4+6+8) = 5x + 20. Wait, let

---------------

's check: 2+4 is 6, +6 is 12, +8 is 20. So total sum is 5x + 20. 

Then when divided by 10, that's

---------------

 (5x + 20)/10. Simplify that, divide numerator and denominator by 5: (x +4)/2. Wait, that

---------------

's right because 5x +20 is 5(x+4), so divided by 10 is (5(x+4))/10 = (x+4)/2. 

So (x +4)/2 must be a perfect square. Because

---------------

 the division by 10 gives a perfect square. 

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check. The sum is 5x + 20. Divided by 10 is

---------------

 (5x +20)/10 = (x +4)/2. So (x+4)/2 is a perfect square. 

So that expression

---------------

 (x+4)/2 has to be a perfect square. Let me denote that as k², where k is an integer. So (x+4)/2 = k² → x +4 = 2k² → x = 2k² -4. 

But x is a two-digit odd number. Since x has to be odd, 2k² -4 must be odd. Let's see: 2k² is even, subtract

---------------

 4 (even) gives even minus even, which is even? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, hold

---------------

 on. Wait, if 2k² is even, then 2k² -4 is even minus even, so even. But x must be odd. Hmm

---------------

, that's a problem. 

Wait, so there's a contradiction here. Because x has to be an odd two-digit number, but according to this equation, x would be even. That can't be right. Did I make a mistake?

Let me go back. The sum is 5x +20. Divided by 10 gives

---------------

 (5x +20)/10. Let me compute that again. 5x+20 divided by 10 is (5(x +4))/10 = (x+4)/2. Yes

---------------

, that's correct. So (x+4)/2 must be a perfect square. 

But x is odd. Let me see, x is odd, so x+4 is odd + even = odd. Then (x+4) is odd. Divided by 2,

---------------

 that would be a fraction unless (x+4) is even. Wait, but x is odd, so x+4 is odd plus even (4 is even) so odd

---------------

. So (x+4) is odd, so (x+4)/2 would be a fraction, which can't be a perfect square unless the fraction is an integer. 



---------------

Hmm, so there must be some mistake here. Wait, maybe I made an error in the setup. Let me check again. 

The five consecutive odd numbers: Let me call

---------------

 the first term as the first number. Let me denote them as a, a+2, a+4, a+6, a+8. Sum

---------------

 is 5a + (0+2+4+6+8) = 5a + 20. Yes

---------------

 that's correct. 

Divided by 10 gives (5a +20)/10 = (a +4)/2. So that

---------------

 has to be an integer perfect square. Therefore (a +4) must be even, because (a+4)/2 is an integer. But

---------------

 a is odd, so a+4 is odd + even = odd. Wait, that's a problem. Because (a +4) is odd, so when divided by 2, it's a fraction. Therefore

---------------

, this suggests that (a+4)/2 must be a perfect square, but since it's a fraction, that can't be. 

Wait, so

---------------

 maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the question says that when the sum is divided by 10, the result is an integer which is a perfect square. Therefore, the sum must be divisible by 10. Therefore, (5a +20) must be divisible by 10. Let

---------------

 me see. 

The sum is 5a +20. So 5(a +4). For this to be divisible by 10, 

---------------

5(a+4) must be divisible by 10 → a+4 must be even. Because 5*(even) is divisible by 10. So a+4 must be even. But a is an odd number (since it's a two-digit odd number), so a is odd. Then

---------------

 a+4 is odd + even = odd. Which is not even. Therefore, this is a contradiction. 

Wait, so that

---------------

 would mean that there is no such sequence? But that can't be the case because the question is giving options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. 

Alternatively, maybe the numbers

---------------

 are consecutive, but the first number is not a, but let me think differently. Let me let the five numbers be n-4, n-2, n, n+2, n+4. That

---------------

 way, the middle term is n. Then the sum is 5n. Because adding those terms: (n-4)+(n-2)+n+(n+2)+(n+4) = 5n. So the sum is 5n. 

Ah! Maybe I should have considered the middle term as n. That might be a better approach. Because then

---------------

 the sum is 5n. Then when divided by 10, it becomes (5n)/10 = n/2. So n/2 must be a perfect square. 

Ah

---------------

, that makes more sense. Because then n must be even, but n is the middle term of five consecutive odd numbers. Wait, but if the numbers are consecutive odd numbers, their middle term (the third one) must also be odd, right? Because odd

---------------

 numbers are spaced by 2. So for example, if the numbers are 1,3,5,7,9, the middle term is 5, which is odd. 

Wait, so if the middle term n is odd, then n must be odd, but then n/2 would not be an integer unless n is even. So

---------------

 this also seems contradictory. 

Hmm, so maybe I need to re-examine the problem again. Let me read the question again. 

"The sum of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square,

---------------

 which of the following can be one of these 5 numbers?"

Wait, perhaps the problem says that when the sum is divided by 10, the result is an integer which is a perfect square. Therefore, the sum must be divisible by 10, so the sum mod 10 is 0. 

Let me think

---------------

 again using the first approach. Let me try using the first approach again with the first term as a. 

Sum is 5a +20. To

---------------

 be divisible by 10, 5a +20 must be divisible by 10. So 5(a +4) divisible by 10 → a+4 must be even. Since

---------------

 a is odd, a+4 is odd + even = odd, so that can't be. So this suggests that there is no solution? But the question is

---------------

 giving options, so I must have made a mistake. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I set up the problem

---------------

. Let me try the middle term approach again. Let me let the five numbers be n-4, n-2, n, n+2, n+4. All

---------------

 odd, so n must be odd. The sum is 5n. So 5n divided by 10 is n/2. So

---------------

 n/2 must be a perfect square. 

Therefore, n must be twice a perfect square, and also an odd number. Because

---------------

 n is the middle term. But n is odd, so 2*(perfect square) must be odd? But 2 times anything is even. That

---------------

's a problem. 

Hmm. So this approach also leads to a contradiction. Wait a second, maybe the problem is in the way the numbers are considered

---------------

. Let me think of another way. 

Wait, maybe the numbers are consecutive odd numbers, so their average is the middle term. The average is (sum)/5 = (sum)/5. Then

---------------

 the sum divided by 10 is (sum)/10 = (sum/5)/2. Which would be (average)/2. So if

---------------

 that's a perfect square, then average/2 is a perfect square. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is correct and I'm missing something. Let me try

---------------

 plugging in the options. Since the options are given, maybe that's easier. Let's see the options: A)47, B)91, C)41, D)67, E)44. 

Wait, E

---------------

) is 44 which is even, so it can't be one of the numbers because all numbers are odd. So E is out. 

So the options are A,B,C,D. Let me check each one

---------------

. 

Starting with option A:47. Suppose 47 is one of the numbers. Let's see if there's a sequence of five consecutive odd numbers that includes 47, such that their sum divided by 10 is a perfect square. 

Let

---------------

 me consider 47 as the middle term. Then the numbers would be 43,45,47,49,51. The sum is 43+45+47+49+51. Let me add them up: 43+51=94, 45+49=94, plus 47. So total is 94+94=188 +47=235. Sum is 235. Divided by 10 is 23.5. Not an integer, so that's invalid. 

Alternatively, maybe 47 is not the middle term. Let's see.

---------------

 Let's say 47 is the first term. Then the numbers would be 47,49,51,53,55. Sum is 47+49+51+53+55. Let's add them: 47+55=102, 49+53=102, and 51. Total is 102+102=204 +51=255. 255 divided by 10 is 25.5, which isn't an integer. 

If 47 is the second term, the sequence would be 45,47,49,51,53. Sum is 45+47+49+51+53. Let's calculate: 45+53=98, 47+51=98, 49. So total is 98+98=196 +49=245. Divided by 10 is 24.5, not integer. 

Third term (

---------------

the middle term) we already did. Fourth term: 47 is the fourth term. So the sequence is 43,45,47,49,51? Wait no. Wait, the fourth

---------------

 term would be like first term 43, then 45,47,49,51. Wait no, if

---------------

 the fourth term is 47, then first term would be 43, second 45, third 47? Wait no, the

---------------

 fourth term would be 47, so the numbers are 41,43,45,47,49. Wait

---------------

, let me think. Let me see. 

Wait, if 47 is the fourth term, then the first term is 47 - 2*(4-1) = 47-6=41. So the numbers are 41,43,45,47,49. Sum is 41+43+45+47+49. Let's add: 41+49=90, 43+47=90, 45. Total 90+90=180 +45=225. 225 divided by 10 is 22.5. Not integer. 

Fifth term: so

---------------

 47 is the fifth term. Then first term is 47-8=39. The numbers are 39,41,43,45,47. Sum is 39+41+43+45+47. Let's add: 39+47=86, 41+45=86, 43. Total 86+86=172 +43=215. Divided by 10 is 21.5. Not integer. 

Hmm, so none

---------------

 of the positions for 47 gives a sum divisible by 10. So maybe 47 is not the correct answer. 

Let's try option B) 91. Since

---------------

 it's a two-digit number, but 91 is two digits. Let's see. Let's check if 91 can be in such a sequence. Let me try

---------------

 the same approach. 

Suppose 91 is the middle term. Then the numbers are 87,89,91,93,95. Sum is 87+89+91+93+95. Let's add: 87+95=182, 89+93=182, plus 91. Total is 182+182=364 +91=455. Divided by 10 is 45.5. Not integer. 

If 91 is the first term, the sequence would be 91,93,95,97,99. Sum is 91+93+95+97+99. Let's compute: 91+99=190, 93+97=190, 95. Total 190+190=380 +95=475. Divided by 10 is 47.5. Not integer. 

If 91 is the second term: first

---------------

 term is 89. The numbers are 89,91,93,95,97. Sum is 89+91+93+95+97. Adding: 89+97=186, 91+95=186, 93. Total 186+186=372 +93=465. Divided by 10 is 46.5. Not integer. 

Third term (middle): already checked. Fourth term: so

---------------

 91 is the fourth term. Then first term is 91-6=85. The numbers are 85,87,89,91,93. Sum: 85+87+89+91+93. Adding: 85+93=178, 87+91=178, 89. Total 178+178=356 +89=445. Divided by 10 is 44.5. Not integer. 

Fifth term: 91 is fifth, so first term is 91-8=83. Numbers:83,85,87,89,91. Sum:83+85+87+89+91. Let's add: 83+91=174, 85+89=174, 87. Total 174+174=348 +87=435. Divided by 10 is 43.5. Not integer. 

Hmm, so 91 also doesn't work. 

Moving to option C)41. Let's check 41. 

Let me try 

---------------

41 as the middle term. Then the numbers are 37,39,41,43,45. Sum is 37+39+41+43+45. Let's add: 37+45=82, 39+43=82, 41. Total 82+82=164 +41=205. Divided by 10 is 20.5. Not integer. 

If 41 is first term: sequence

---------------

 is 41,43,45,47,49. Sum is 41+43+45+47+49. Let

---------------

's add: 41+49=90, 43+47=90, 45. Total 90+90=180 +45=225. Divided by 10 is 22.5. Not integer. 

Second term: first term is 39. Numbers:39,41,43,45,47. Sum:39+41+43+45+47. Adding:39+47=86, 41+45=86, 43. Total 86+86=172 +43=215. Divided by 10 is 21.5. Not integer. 

Third term (middle): already

---------------

 checked. Fourth term: so 41 is fourth term. First term is 41-6=35. The numbers:35,37,39,41,43. Sum:35+37+39+41+43. Let's compute:35+43=78, 37+41=78, 39. Total 78+78=156 +39=195. Divided by 10 is 19.5. Not integer. 

Fifth term: 41 is fifth term. First term is 41-8=33. Numbers:33,35,37,39,41. Sum:33+35+37+39+41. Adding:33+41=74, 35+39=74, 37. Total 74+74=148 +37=185. Divided by 10 is 18.5. Not integer. 

Hmm, so 41 also doesn't work. 

Next, option D)67. Let's try this one. 

Let

---------------

's see if 67 can be in a sequence. Let's try different positions. 

First, let's see if 67 is the middle term. Then the numbers would be 63,65,67,69,71. Sum:63+65+67+69+71. Let's add:63+71=134, 65+69=134, 67. Total 134+134=268 +67=335. Divided by 10 is 33.5. Not integer. 

If 67 is the first term: numbers are 67,69,71,73,75. Sum:67+69+71+73+75. Adding:67+75=142, 69+73=142, 71. Total 142+142=284 +71=355. 355/10 is 35.5. Not integer. 

Second term: first term is 65. Numbers:65,67,69,71,73. Sum:65+67+69+71+73. Adding:65+73=138, 67+71=138, 69. Total 138+138=276 +69=345. Divided by 10 is 34.5. Not integer. 

Third term (middle): tried

---------------

 that. Fourth term: 67 is the fourth term. So first term is 67-6=61. The numbers are 61,63,65,67,69. Sum:61+63+65+67+69. Let's compute:61+69=130, 63+67=130, 65. Total 130+130=260 +65=325. 325 divided by 10 is 32.5. Not integer. 

Fifth term: 67 is fifth, so first term is 67-8=59. Numbers:59,61,63,65,67. Sum:59+61+63+65+67. Adding:59+67=126, 61+65=126, 63. Total 126+126=252 +63=315. Divided by 10 is 31.5. Not integer. 

Hmm, so 67 also not working. 

Wait, so

---------------

 all the options except E (which is even) are not working. Did I make a mistake here? Maybe I need to check

---------------

 another approach. 

Wait, maybe I made an error in the setup. Let's go back. 

The problem states that when the sum is divided by 10, it becomes a perfect square. So the sum divided by 10 must be a perfect square, which is an integer. So the sum must be divisible by 10. 

Let

---------------

 me consider the first approach again, where the sum is 5a + 20. 

We have that 5a +20 must be divisible by 10. Therefore

---------------

, 5(a+4) divisible by 10 → a+4 must be even. Since a is an odd number (because

---------------

 it's a two-digit odd number), then a is odd. So a+4 is odd + even = odd. So

---------------

 a+4 is odd. Therefore, 5*(odd) is divisible by 10? Wait 5*(odd number) would be 5 times an odd, which is divisible by 5 but not necessarily by 2. Therefore

---------------

, 5*(a+4) would be divisible by 5 but not by 2. So it can't be divisible by 10. 

Therefore

---------------

, this suggests that there is no such sequence of five consecutive two-digit odd numbers where the sum is divisible by 10. But since the problem gives options, maybe

---------------

 there's a mistake in my reasoning. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question allows the perfect square to be a non-integer? But no, a perfect square must

---------------

 be an integer. 

Hmm, maybe I need to consider that the division could result in a perfect square even if it's not an integer? Like 

---------------

25/10 = 2.5, but that's not a perfect square. 

Wait, perhaps I need to consider

---------------

 that the question means that when you divide the sum by 10, the result is a perfect square, which must be an integer. Therefore, the sum must be a multiple of 10, but according to the above, that's impossible for

---------------

 consecutive odds. 

Hmm, but the problem must have a solution. Let me think differently. 

Let me try to see

---------------

 what possible sums can be. Let me think of the five numbers as n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8. The

---------------

 sum is 5n +20. 

We need (5n +20)/10 = (n +4)/2 is a perfect square. Wait, but

---------------

 (n +4)/2 must be an integer. So (n+4) must be even, so n must be even. But n is the first term of the five consecutive odd numbers, so n has to be odd. Contradiction again. 

Therefore

---------------

, the only way this can be possible is if (n+4)/2 is a perfect square and an integer. But

---------------

 n must be even. Which can't be. 

Hmm, this is a problem. Unless the question allows for the first

---------------

 number to be even but the rest odd? No, because they are consecutive odd numbers. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is

---------------

 in another language and there's a mistranslation? Like perhaps "when divided by 10" means divided by 10 and floored or something else? 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me try to think of the five numbers as starting from an even number. Wait no, they have to be odd. 

Wait, maybe the numbers

---------------

 are not necessarily starting with an odd number, but the numbers themselves are odd. So they have to be consecutive odd numbers, so each

---------------

 is two more than the previous. 

Wait, but even if n is even, the numbers would be even, which they

---------------

 can't be. 

Hmm. Let me try to think of possible values. Let me suppose that (n+4)/2 is a perfect square. Let me suppose

---------------

 that (n+4)/2 = k². So n = 2k² -4. Since n must be a two-digit odd number. 

So n is 2k²-4. Since

---------------

 n must be two-digit and odd. Let's see possible k's. Let me see for k from 2 upwards. 

k=2: 2*(4) -4 =8-4=4. Not

---------------

 two-digit. 

k=3: 2*9 -4= 18-4=14. 

---------------

14 is even. Not odd. 

k=4: 2*16-4=32-4=28. Even. 

k=5: 2*25 -4=50-4=46. Even. 

k=6: 2*36-4=72-4=68. Even. 

k=7: 2*49-4=98-4=94. Even. 

Hmm, all even. 



---------------

Wait, so this suggests that there is no solution? But the problem says "which of the following can be one of these 5 numbers". So

---------------

 perhaps the question has a typo, or I'm missing something. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the five numbers are not necessarily starting from n, but arranged

---------------

 differently. Wait, but they have to be consecutive odds, so that's the only way. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question

---------------

 says "consecutive numbers" but not necessarily odd? Wait, no, it says "5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers". 

Wait, perhaps the division

---------------

 by 10 is integer division, so floor division? Like 25 divided by 10 is 2, but that's not a perfect square. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is

---------------

 (sum divided by 10) is a perfect square, but the division is not necessarily exact. Like 225 divided by 10 is 22.5, but that's not a perfect square. 

Hmm, this

---------------

 is confusing. Let me see if any of the options can be part of a sequence where the sum divided by 10 is a perfect square even if it's not an integer. For

---------------

 example, if the sum is 225, which divided by 10 is 22.5. But that's not a square. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the equation

---------------

. Let me re-derive the sum. 

Let me try with the five numbers as n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8. The sum is 5n + (2+4+6+8) =5n +20. So

---------------

 that's correct. 

Then (5n +20)/10 = (n +4)/2 must be a perfect square. 

So

---------------

 (n+4)/2 = m², where m is integer. 

So n = 2m² -4. 

Now

---------------

 n must be a two-digit odd number. Let me try different m values. 

m=3: 2*(9) -4 = 18-4=14. Even. 

m=4: 2*(16)-4=28. Even. 

m=5: 2*25-4=46 even. 

m=6: 2*36-4=68 even. 

m=1: 2*1 -4= -2. Not positive. 

Hmm, so no

---------------

 solution here. 

Wait, what if m is fractional? But m has to be integer. 

Wait, perhaps the question allows m

---------------

 to be a non-integer? But then (n+4)/2 would not be a perfect square integer. 

Hmm. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider the five numbers as including both even and odd? But the question says they are consecutive odd numbers. 

Wait, maybe I made

---------------

 a mistake in the problem's phrasing. The question says "the sum of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square". Maybe "when divided by 10" refers

---------------

 to each number divided by 10? That would be odd, but that doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, the sum divided by 10 is

---------------

 a perfect square. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is in another language and there was a mistranslation. Maybe it's "

---------------

divided by 5"? Let me check. If divided by 5, then (5n+20)/5 = n+4, which must be a perfect square. Then n+4 = m². So n = m² -4. Since

---------------

 n is a two-digit odd number, m² must be between 5 (since n is two-digit, so minimum n is 11,

---------------

 so m² has to be at least 15. So m can be from 4 (16) up. 

Wait

---------------

, but if that's the case, then maybe that's the correct interpretation. But the problem says divided by 10. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question says

---------------

 divided by 10 and rounded? But that's a stretch. 

Alternatively, maybe the sum divided by 10 is a perfect square, but the

---------------

 division is exact. So the sum must be 10*k². 

Wait, let's think of possible sums that are multiples of 10 and see

---------------

 if they can be the sum of five consecutive odd numbers. 

Let me think of possible sums: the sum of five consecutive odd numbers. Let me think

---------------

 of an example. Let's pick numbers like 11,13,15,17,19. Their sum is 75. Divided by 10 is 7.5, not square. 

Another example: 13,15,17,19,21. Sum is 85. Divided by 10 is 8.5. Not square. 

Let

---------------

 me try 15,17,19,21,23. Sum is 15+17=32, 19+23=42, plus 21. Total 32+42=74 +21=95. 95/10=9.5. Not square. 

Hmm

---------------

. Let me think of a possible sum divisible by 10. Let's see. 

Suppose the sum is 200. 200 divided by 10 is 20, which is not a perfect square. 

2

---------------

25 divided by 10 is 22.5. Not square. 

250/10=25. 25 is a perfect square (5^2). So

---------------

 sum would be 250. 

So, if the sum is 250, then divided by 10 is 25, which is a perfect square. 

So let's see if there exists five consecutive two-digit odd numbers adding to 250. 

Let me find

---------------

 the numbers. Let the numbers be n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8. The sum is 5n +20 =250 → 5n=230 →n=46. 

But 46 is even. So the first number would be 46, but that's even. Not allowed. 

Hmm, so that's not possible. 

Next

---------------

, 324 divided by 10 is 32.4. Not integer. 

Wait, maybe sum is 324? Not

---------------

 sure. Let me think of the next perfect square after 25 is 36. 36*10=360. 

So sum is

---------------

 360. Then 5n+20=360 →5n=340 →n=68. Even again. 

Next square: 49 → 490. 5n+20=490 →5n=470 →n=94. Even. 

Hmm. 64 →640. 5n+20=640 →5n=620 →n=124. That

---------------

's three-digit. 

Hmm. 

Another square is 16 →160. 5n+20=160 →5n=140 →n=28. Even. 

Hmm, so all these give

---------------

 even n. 

Wait, so there's a pattern here. To get a sum divisible by 10, the first term must be even, but the numbers must be odd. So

---------------

 this is impossible. 

Wait, so the problem must have a mistake? Or maybe I misunderstood the question. 

Wait, let

---------------

 me read the problem again. "The sum of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square, which of the following can be one of these 5 numbers?"

Wait

---------------

, maybe the question means when each number is divided by 10, but that doesn't make sense. Or the sum divided by 10 is

---------------

 an integer perfect square. 

Wait, maybe the question is not in English originally, and "divided by 10" could

---------------

 be "divided by 5". Let's see what happens if divided by 5. 

If divided by 5, then sum /5 is perfect square. 



---------------

Sum is 5n+20. Divided by 5 is n+4. So n+4 must be perfect square. 

So n = m² -4. 

Since

---------------

 n must be a two-digit odd number. 

Let me try m=5: 25-4=21. So

---------------

 n=21. 

The numbers would be 21,23,25,27,29. Their sum is 21+23+25+27+29=125. Divided by 5 is 25, which is 5 squared. 

So yes

---------------

, that works. So 21 is the first number, and the numbers are 21,23,25,27,29. 



---------------

So in this case, the numbers include 25, which is one of the numbers. 

But the options given are 47,91,41,67,44. 

Hmm, so

---------------

 none of these are in this sequence. 

Wait, maybe m=6: m²=36 →36-4=32. Even. 

m=7: 49-4=45. That

---------------

's odd. 

So m=7 gives n=45. 

Numbers:45,47,49,51,53. Sum is 45+47+49+51+53. 

Adding:45+53=98, 47+51=98, 49. Total 98+98=196 +49=245. Divided by 5 is 49, which is 7 squared. 

So in

---------------

 this case, the numbers are 45,47,49,51,53. So 47 is one of them. 

Ah! So

---------------

 if the question had said divided by 5, then option A (47) would be correct. 

Wait, but the problem states divided by 10. But

---------------

 if it's divided by 5, then 47 is possible. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question had a typo and it

---------------

 should be divided by 5. Because otherwise, there's no solution. 

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the

---------------

 numbers again with sum 245. Divided by 10 is 24.5, which is not a perfect square, but divided by 5 is 49. 

If

---------------

 the question is correct as written, then perhaps the answer is 47 (option A) because even though the division by 10 gives a non-integer, maybe the problem allows

---------------

 for that? But that doesn't make sense because a perfect square has to be an integer. 

Wait, but perhaps the question means

---------------

 the sum divided by 10 is an integer which is a perfect square. So the sum must be divisible by 10. 

But

---------------

 in the case of n=45 (the example above), the sum is 245, which is not divisible by 10. 

Hmm. 

Wait, but

---------------

 let's see if there's any possible sequence where the sum divided by 10 is a perfect square. 

Suppose the sum is 225. 

---------------

225 divided by 10 is 22.5. Not integer. 

Sum 250:

---------------

 gives n=46, even. 

Sum 324: 324/10 is 32.4. 

Sum 4

---------------

00: divided by 10 is 40. Not a square. 

Sum 441: divided by 10 is 44.1. 

Wait, maybe

---------------

 2500? No, way too big. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the question allows for the perfect

---------------

 square to be a fraction? Like (225/10) =22.5, but sqrt(22.5) is not an integer. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is

---------------

 in base 10, but divided by 10 in another base? Unlikely. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup

---------------

. Let me think again. 

Wait, maybe the numbers are five consecutive odd numbers, but not necessarily starting with an odd number? No, they have to be odd. 

Alternatively, perhaps the numbers

---------------

 are like 10,12,14,16,18 but those are even. 

Wait, maybe

---------------

 the question is about two-digit numbers, but allowing the first to be even? No, they must be odd. 

Hmm. This is perplexing. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the question allows the perfect square to be zero? But zero is a perfect square. But sum divided by 10 would

---------------

 be zero, which requires the sum to be zero. Not possible with positive numbers. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from

---------------

 a source that had an error. Given that, perhaps the correct answer is A)47, because in the case where divided by 5, it works. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation when I tried option C)41. Let me check again. 

Wait, for

---------------

 option C)41, let's try when it's the second term. 

First term is 39. The numbers are 39,41,43,45,47. Sum is 39+41+43+45+47. 

Adding:

---------------

 39+47=86, 41+45=86, 43. Total 86+86=172 +43=215. 215 divided by 10 is 21.5. 

Hmm

---------------

. 

Wait, perhaps the question is when divided by 10, the decimal part is ignored? Like integer division. 

---------------

215//10=21, which is not a square. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe I'm

---------------

 missing a sequence where the numbers are larger. 

Let me think of m=9: n = 2*(9)^2 -4 → Wait

---------------

 no, that was from the equation where the sum divided by 10 must be a square. 

Wait, let me try m

---------------

= something else. 

Wait, let's suppose that the sum divided by 10 is a perfect square, but allowing

---------------

 it to be a decimal which is a square of a fraction. But that's not standard. 

Alternatively, maybe the question means

---------------

 that the sum is a perfect square when divided by 10, so the sum is 10 times a perfect square. 

So

---------------

 sum =10k². 

Then, 5n +20 =10k² →5(n +4)=10k² →n+4=2k² →n=2k² -4. 

Now

---------------

 n must be a two-digit odd number. 

So 2k² -4 must be a two-digit odd number. 

So let's solve

---------------

 for k: 

2k² -4 ≥10 (two-digit) →2k² ≥14 →k² ≥7 →k≥3 (since 3²=9). 

Also, 2k² -4 ≤99 →2k² ≤103 →k² ≤51.5 →k ≤7 (since 7²=49, 8²=64>51.5). 

So possible k values are 3,4,5,6,7. 

Let's check each: 

k=3: 2*9-4=18-4=14 → even. Not acceptable

---------------

. 

k=4: 2*16-4=28 → even. 

k=5: 2*25-4=46 → even. 

k=6: 2*36-4=68 → even. 

k=7: 2*49-4=94 → even. 

All even. 

So again

---------------

, no solution. 

This is really confusing. The problem must have an answer. Maybe the question is different. 

Wait, maybe

---------------

 the numbers are consecutive numbers, not necessarily odd? Let me check. 

If they are five consecutive numbers (not necessarily odd), but the question says "consecutive two-digit odd numbers". 

Alternatively, maybe the question is

---------------

 referring to five consecutive numbers which are odd, but the numbers themselves are two-digit numbers. 

Wait, but that's the same as consecutive odd two-digit numbers. 

Hmm. 

Wait, perhaps the question allows

---------------

 the first number to be a single-digit odd number? Like starting from 9. Let's see. 

Suppose the numbers are 9,11,13,15,17. Sum is 9+11+13+15+17=65. 65/10=6.5. Not a square. 

Another

---------------

 example: 11,13,15,17,19 →75. 7.5. 

13,15,17,19,21 →85 →8.5. 

15,17,19,21,23 →95 →9.5. 

17,19,21,23,25 →105 →10.5. 

19,21,23,25,27 →115 →11.5. 

21,23,25,27,29 →125 →12.5. 

23,25,27,29,31 →135 →13.5. 

25,27,29,31,33 →145 →14.5. 

27,29,31,33,35 →155 →15.5. 

29,31,33,35,37 →165 →16.5 →16.5 is not a square. 

Wait 165 divided by 10 is 16.5, but 16.5 is not a perfect square. 

Wait, 

---------------

31,33,35,37,39 → sum 175 →17.5. 

33,35,37,39,41 →185 →18.5. 

35,37,39,41,43 →195 →19.5. 

37,39,41,43,45 →205 →20.5. 

39,41,43,45,47 →215 →21.5. 

41,43,45,47,49 →225 →22.5. 

43,45,47,49,51 →235 →23.5. 

45,47,49,51,53 →245 →24.5. 

47,49,51,53,55 →255 →25.5. 

49,51,53,55,57 →265 →26.5. 

51,53,55,57,59 →275 →27.5. 

53,55,57,59,61 →285 →28.5. 

55,57,59,61,63 →295 →29.5. 

57,59,61,63,65 →315 →31.5. 

59,61,63,65,67 →315 →31.5. 

Hmm, none

---------------

 of these sums divided by 10 give perfect squares. 

Wait, what about 95? 95 divided by 10 is 9.5. Not square. 

Wait, what

---------------

 if the numbers are 1,3,5,7,9? But they are single-digit. 

Hmm. 

Wait

---------------

, perhaps the question allows the numbers to be three-digit? But it says two-digit. 

Alternatively, maybe the perfect square is 

---------------

0. But sum would have to be zero. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial equation. 

Wait, let me try one

---------------

 last time. 

The sum of five consecutive odd numbers is 5n + 20. 

We need (5n +20)/10 = (n +4)/2 is a perfect square. 

So

---------------

 (n+4)/2 must be an integer and a perfect square. 

Therefore, n+4 must be even, so n is even. But n is the first term of consecutive odd numbers, so n must be odd. 

Contradiction. 

Therefore, there's no solution. But the options are given, so maybe

---------------

 the question is different. 

Wait, the question says "can be one of these 5 numbers". Perhaps there's a sequence where one of the numbers is in

---------------

 the options even if the total doesn't fit? Like, maybe the question is not requiring the entire condition to hold for the

---------------

 sequence containing that number, but just that such a sequence exists where one of the numbers is the option? 

Wait, but that's what I've been trying. 

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 the problem is in the way I'm interpreting consecutive. Maybe consecutive even numbers? But the question says odd. 

Alternatively, maybe it's consecutive in another way. 

Wait, maybe

---------------

 the numbers are consecutive even numbers? Let me check. 

If the numbers are consecutive even two-digit numbers, then their sum divided by 10 being

---------------

 a perfect square. 

Let me see. 

Suppose the numbers are n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8 (even numbers). 

Sum is 5n +20. 

Divided by 10: (5n+20)/10 = (n+4)/2. 

So

---------------

 (n+4)/2 must be perfect square. 

n is even, so n+4 is even. 

So

---------------

 (n+4)/2 must be a perfect square. 

n = 2k² -4. 

Since n is two-digit even number. 

Let me see possible k's. 

k=3: 2*(9) -4=14 → n

---------------

=14. 

Numbers are 14,16,18,20,22. Sum 14+16+18+20+22=90. 90/10=9 →

---------------

3². 

Yes! So this works. The numbers are 14-22 even. But the question specifies

---------------

 two-digit odd numbers. 

Ah! So if the question had said even numbers, then the answer would be 16,18, etc. But since it's odd, maybe

---------------

 the question has a typo. 

Alternatively, perhaps the options have a mistake. 

Looking at the options again: 

A)47 



---------------

B)91 

C)41 

D)67 

E)44 

E)44 is even, but the

---------------

 rest are odd. 

Wait, if the question was for even numbers, then 44 could be part of such a sequence. Let's see. 

Let

---------------

 me see if 44 is part of such a sequence. 

Suppose 44 is the middle term. The numbers would be 40,42,44,46,48. Sum is 220. Divided by 10 is 22, not square. 

Alternatively, as

---------------

 first term: 44,46,48,50,52. Sum is 44+46=90, 48+52=100, plus50 → total 90+100+50=240. 240/10=24. Not square. 

Hmm

---------------

. 

Alternatively, the first term n=2k²-4. For k=5, n=2*25-4=46. 

Numbers 46,48,50,52,54. Sum is 250. Divided by 10 is 25, which is 5 squared. 

So the

---------------

 numbers are 46,48,50,52,54. 

So 48 is in there. But none

---------------

 of the options are 48. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, for k=4: n=2*16-4=28. 

Numbers 28,30,32,34,36. Sum is 160 →160/10=16.

---------------

 Which is 4 squared. 

So the numbers are 28-36 even. 

The numbers include 30,32 etc. Not in options. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively

---------------

, the question is correct and the answer is none of the options, but that can't be. 

Wait, perhaps the problem allows

---------------

 the perfect square to be a decimal? Like 22.5 = (4.743)^2 approximately, but not an integer. 

Alternatively

---------------

, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. 

Wait, maybe the five numbers are not in arithmetic sequence with difference 2. Wait

---------------

, no, consecutive odd numbers must be spaced by 2. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the question refers to five consecutive numbers in

---------------

 the sense of consecutive integers, but all odd. So they are consecutive numbers but only selecting the odd ones. For example, 1,3,5,7,9. 



---------------

Wait, that's the same as consecutive odd numbers. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for when the sum is divided by 10, the result is a perfect square, but not necessarily an integer. For

---------------

 example, 225 divided by 10 is 22.5, but 22.5 isn't a perfect square. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is

---------------

 in base 10, but the perfect square is in another base? 

This is getting me nowhere. 

Wait, let

---------------

 me try the options again with the condition that the sum divided by 10 is a perfect square, even if the sum

---------------

 isn't divisible by 10. 

Let me check option C)41. 

Suppose the sequence includes 41. Let's see

---------------

 if there's any sequence with 41 where the sum divided by 10 is a square. 

Let's try

---------------

 the sequence 37,39,41,43,45. Sum is 37+39+41+43+45 = 205. 205/10 =20.5 → not

---------------

 square. 

If the sequence is 41,43,45,47,49. Sum 225 →225/10=22.5. 

Another

---------------

 sequence with 41 as the third term: 39,41,43,45,47. Sum 215 →21.5. 

Hmm. 

Option D)67. Let's see a

---------------

 sequence including 67. 

Say 63,65,67,69,71 → sum 63+65=128, 67+71=138, plus 69. Total 128+138=266 +69=335 →335/10=33.5. Not square. 

If

---------------

 the sequence is 65,67,69,71,73 → sum 65+67+69+71+73. Let's add:65+73=138, 67+71=138, 69. Total 276 +69=345 →34.5. 

Hmm. 

Wait, option

---------------

 A)47. The sequence 45,47,49,51,53 has sum 245 →245/10=24.5. 

Hmm

---------------

. 

Wait, maybe the problem is that the division is integer division, like floor division. 

245 divided by 10 is 24, which is 4.898 squared

---------------

, but not a perfect square. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's statement. 



---------------

Wait, the problem says "the sum of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square". Maybe it means that when each number is divided by 10, it

---------------

 becomes a perfect square. But that would require each number divided by 10 to be a square, which would mean each number is 10 times a square. The

---------------

 two-digit numbers would be like 10, 40, 90. But they have to be odd. So 

---------------

10 is even, 40 even, 90 even. So no. 

Alternatively, maybe the sum divided by 10 is a perfect square when considered

---------------

 as a two-digit number. Like the sum is a two-digit number divided by 10 gives a single-digit square. 



---------------

But that doesn't make sense. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the question allows for the sum to be 10 times a perfect square, even if the numbers aren't two

---------------

-digit? 

Wait, but the problem states the numbers are two-digit. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem means that the sum divided by 10 is a perfect square when rounded to the nearest integer? 

For example, 225/10=22.5 →

---------------

 rounded to 23, not a square. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from an Indian exam where "perfect square" could

---------------

 mean something else? Not sure. 

Wait, given that the options are given, perhaps the correct answer is C)41, even though my

---------------

 calculations didn't find a valid sequence. Let me try again with option C. 

Suppose the sequence is 37,39,41,43,45. Sum is 205. 205/10=20.5. Not square. 

What

---------------

 about a different sequence where 41 is the middle term? 

Wait, the numbers would be 37,39,41,43,45. Which

---------------

 we've done. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the numbers are 41,43,45,47,49. Sum is 225. 225/10=22.5. Not square. 

Hmm. 

Wait, what

---------------

 if the numbers are 19,21,23,25,27. Their sum is 19+21=40, 23+27=50, 25 → total 40+50=90 +25=115. 115/10=11.5. Not square. 

Hmm. 

Wait, maybe

---------------

 the question requires the sum divided by 10 to be a perfect square, but not necessarily an integer. For example, 25.

---------------

 So sum is 250. 

Then the sequence would have first term 46, but that's even. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the question allows the first term to be even?

---------------

 

If so, then the sequence 46,48,50,52,54. Sum 250. Divided by 10 is 25. 



---------------

The numbers are all even, but the question specifies odd. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the question had a typo and it

---------------

's supposed to be consecutive even numbers. Then the answer would be 46 or 48, but not in options. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question

---------------

 is correct and the answer is 41, even if I can't find the sequence. 

Wait, let's think differently. Suppose

---------------

 that the sum divided by 10 is a perfect square. Let me think of the sum as S=10k². 

The

---------------

 numbers are five consecutive odd numbers. 

The average is S/5 = 2k². 

The average must be the middle term, so the middle term is 2k². 

The middle term must be odd, so 2k² must be odd. Which requires that k² is a half-integer? No, k

---------------

 must be integer. 

Thus, 2k² is even. So the middle term must be even, but it's part of a

---------------

 sequence of odd numbers. Contradiction. 

Thus, there's no solution. But the question has options. 

Hmm

---------------

. 

Wait, maybe the question is not requiring the entire sequence to be two-digit numbers? 

For example, if the first number is a single-digit odd number. Let me try that

---------------

. 

Let me try k=3: 

n=2*(3)^2 -4 = 14 → even. 

No

---------------

. 

k=4: n=28 even. 

k=5: n=46 even. 

Hmm

---------------

. 

Wait, what if the first number is a two-digit even number but the rest are odd? No, consecutive odds must all be odd. 

Hmm. 

I

---------------

 think there must be an error in the problem's options. But since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps I made a mistake in my

---------------

 earlier calculations. 

Let me recheck option C)41. 

Wait, maybe the sequence is not starting from the first term but somewhere

---------------

 else. 

Suppose the five numbers are 39,41,43,45,47. Their sum is 39+41+43+45+47 = 215. 215 divided by 10 is 21.5. Not a square. 

Hmm

---------------

. 

Wait, let me try the first term as 15. 

Numbers 15,17,19,21,23. Sum 95. Divided by 10 is9.5. 

Not. 

Hmm. 

Wait, let

---------------

 me think of the equation again. 

We have (n+4)/2 = perfect square. 

But n must be odd, so n=2m-1 (

---------------

since odd numbers are 2m-1). 

So substituting: 

(2m-1 +4)/2 = (2m+3)/2 must be a perfect square. 

So

---------------

 (2m+3)/2 must be a perfect square. 

Let me set that equal to k²: 

(2m+3)/2 =k² → 2m+3 = 2k² → m=(2k²-3)/2 

m must be integer, so 2k² -3 must be even. 

2k² is even, so even minus 3 is odd. So (

---------------

2k²-3) is odd, divided by 2 gives a non-integer. 

Thus, no solution. 

Therefore

---------------

, no solution exists. 

Therefore, the question is flawed. But since the options are given, perhaps the closest is option C)41,

---------------

 because the sum divided by 10 is closest to a square? 

Alternatively, perhaps I missed something. 

Wait, let

---------------

 me think of the sequence 41,43,45,47,49. Sum is 225. Divided by 10 is22.5. The

---------------

 nearest square is 16, 25. 22.5 is between them. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is

---------------

 when the sum is divided by 10 and then rounded to nearest integer is a perfect square. 225/10=22.5 → rounds to 23, not a square. 22

---------------

5/10=22.5 → floor to 22, not. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is

Even though the question says divided by 10, maybe it's a typo. 

Given that, I think the intended answer is A)47.

The problem requires finding one of five consecutive two-digit odd numbers whose sum, when divided by 10, results in a perfect square. Let the first number be \( n \). The numbers are \( n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8 \), and their sum is \( 5n + 20 \). Dividing this sum by 10 gives \( \frac{5n + 20}{10} = \frac{n + 4}{2} \), which must be a perfect square. 

However, since \( n \) is odd, \( n + 4 \) is odd, making \( \frac{n + 4}{2} \) a non-integer, which contradicts the requirement of being a perfect square. This suggests a potential error in the problem's constraints. 

Considering a possible typo where the division should be by 5 instead of 10, the sum divided by 5 (\( n + 4 \)) must be a perfect square. Testing the options:

- **Option A (47):** If \( n = 45 \), the sequence is \( 45, 47, 49, 51, 53 \). The sum is 245, and \( \frac{245}{5} = 49 \) (a perfect square). 

Thus,

47 is part of this valid sequence under the corrected division by 5. Given the problem's constraints and possible typo, the answer is:
