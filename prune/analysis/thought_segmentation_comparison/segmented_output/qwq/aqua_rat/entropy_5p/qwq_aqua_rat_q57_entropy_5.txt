Okay, let's see. The problem is about percentages of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed. Hmm. Alright, so first, I need to parse the information given step by step.

The store has all chocolates either vanilla or cocoa flavored. So that

---------------

's two categories: vanilla and cocoa. The first piece of information says 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored. That means the remaining 90% must be vanilla, right? Because they're the only two options. So cocoa is 10%, vanilla is 90%.

Then the next part says 90% of the rest are squashed. Wait, "the rest" here refers

---------------

 to what? Let me think. The first part took 10% cocoa, so the rest would be the remaining 90% which are vanilla. Oh, so "the rest" must be referring to the vanilla ones. So 90% of the vanilla chocolates are squashed. Wait, no. Wait, the wording is important here. Let me read again.

The question says, "10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, 90% of the rest are squashed." The "rest" after taking out the cocoa ones would be the 90% vanilla. So "90% of the rest" (

---------------

the vanilla) are squashed. So that means 90% of the 90% vanilla are squashed. Therefore, the squashed vanilla would be 0.9 * 90% = 81%. But the question is asking for vanilla and not squashed. So if 81% of the total are squashed vanilla, then the remaining vanilla would be 90% - 81% = 9%? Wait, let

---------------

 me check that again.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach this with a total number of chocolates. Let's assume there are 100 chocolates in total to make percentages easier. 

Total chocolates = 100.

10% are cocoa flavored: so 10 cocoa, 90 vanilla.

Now, "90% of the rest are squashed." The "rest" here must refer to the non-cocoa chocolates, which are 90. So 90% of those 90 are squashed. 

Calculating 90% of 90: 0.9 * 90 = 81. So 81 of the vanilla are squashed. That leaves 90 - 81 = 9 vanilla not squashed. 

So the percentage of the total that is both vanilla and not squashed is 9 out of 100, which is 9%. Wait

---------------

, but 9% is option D. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait another way: The problem

---------------

 says 90% of the rest (the non-cocoa) are squashed. So squashed includes both cocoa and vanilla? Or is the squashed only referring to the vanilla?

Hmm, maybe I misunderstood that part. Let me parse again. The problem

---------------

 says "90% of the rest are squashed". The "rest" after the cocoa ones. So the rest is the 90% vanilla. So of that 90%, 90% are squashed. Therefore, the squashed among

---------------

 the vanilla are 90% of 90% = 81% of the total. Then the vanilla not squashed would be 10% of the 90% vanilla, which is 9% of total. So yes, that's 9%. So the answer would be D)9%.

Wait, but let me check again. Let

---------------

 me see the options. The options include D as 9, which matches. But wait, maybe the "squashed" applies to all chocolates except cocoa? Wait, no, the cocoa

---------------

 ones aren't mentioned in the squashed part. Let me think again. The problem says 10% are cocoa. The rest (so 90%) are vanilla. Then 90% of those rest (the vanilla) are squashed. So squashed here

---------------

 refers to the vanilla. So the non-squashed vanilla is 10% of the rest (the 90%). So 10% of 90 is 9. So yes, 9% is the answer, which is D. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting "the rest". Let me see

---------------

 another way. Suppose that after taking out the cocoa (10%), the remaining 90% are the rest. Then 90% of that rest (so 90% of 90%) are squashed. So the squashed chocolates

---------------

 are 81% of the total. But the question is about vanilla and not squashed. The vanilla not squashed would be 10% of the rest (since 90% of the rest are squashed, so 10% not). So 10% of 90% is 9%. So that's the same as before. So the answer is D)

---------------

9%.


To solve the problem, start by considering the total number of chocolates as 100 for simplicity. 

1. **Cocoa and Vanilla Distribution**:  
   - 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored:  
     \( 10\% \times 100 = 10 \) cocoa-flavored chocolates.  
   - The remaining 90% are vanilla flavored:  
     \( 100 - 10 = 90 \) vanilla-flavored chocolates.  

2. **Calculating Squashed Chocolates**:  
   - The problem states "90% of the rest are squashed," where "the rest" refers to the vanilla-flavored chocolates (the remaining 90%).  
   - 90% of the vanilla-flavored chocolates are squashed:  
     \( 90\% \times 90 = 0.9 \times 90 = 81 \) squashed vanilla chocolates.  

3. **Non-Squashed Vanilla Chocolates**:  
   - Subtract the squashed vanilla chocolates from the total vanilla chocolates:  
     \( 90 - 81 = 9 \).  
   - This means 9 out of 100 total chocolates are both vanilla-flavored and not squashed.  

Thus, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is **9%**.
