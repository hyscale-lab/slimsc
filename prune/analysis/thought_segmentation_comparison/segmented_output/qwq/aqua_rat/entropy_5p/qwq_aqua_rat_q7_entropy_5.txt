Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is about a train's journey where part of it is at 100 mph and then it slows down to 75 mph after a quarter of the distance. We need to find the total time taken. Hmm, let

---------------

's start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, the original scenario is that the train was supposed to take 10 hours at 100 mph. Wait, but does

---------------

 that mean the total distance is calculated based on that speed and time? Because if it's going 100 mph for 10 hours, the total distance would be 100 * 10 = 1000 miles. Oh

---------------

 right, that's probably the total distance. But then the actual journey changes after a quarter of the distance. So the problem is saying

---------------

 that after covering a quarter of the total distance, it starts raining and the speed drops. So the total journey now has two parts: the first quarter at 100 mph, and the remaining three quarters at 75 mph. We need to calculate the total time taken for this modified journey.

Wait, but first

---------------

, let me confirm the total distance. If the original time was 10 hours at 100 mph, then yes, the distance is 100 *10 = 1000 miles. So the total distance is 1000 miles. 



---------------

Now, the first part is a quarter of that distance. A quarter of 1000 is 250 miles. So the first 250 miles are done at 100 mph. The remaining distance is 1000 -250 = 750 miles, which is three quarters, done at 75 mph.

So now

---------------

, compute the time for each part. Time equals distance divided by speed. 

First part: 250 miles / 100 mph = 2.5 hours. 

Second part: 750 miles /75 mph. Let's see, 75 times 10 is 750, so that's 10 hours. Wait, 75*10 is 750, yes. So the second part takes 10 hours. 

Total time is 2.5 + 10 = 12.5 hours. So

---------------

 the answer should be C)12.5.

Wait, but let me check again. Let me make sure I didn't miscalculate anything. Let's re

---------------

-calculate:

Total distance: 100 *10 =1000. Correct. 

First quarter distance: 1000/4 =250. 



---------------

Time for first part: 250 /100 = 2.5 hours. 

Remaining distance: 750. 

Time for second part: 750 divided by 75. 75 goes into 750 ten times. So 10 hours. 

Total time: 2.5 +10 =12.5. That's option C. 

Hmm, but wait, maybe

---------------

 I made a mistake in assuming the total distance is 1000 miles. Let me read the problem again. The question says "A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination." So yes, that's the total distance. So the total

---------------

 distance is indeed 100 *10 =1000. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is interpreted differently? Like, perhaps the 10 hours is the original time without any rain, and now the question is asking for the new time when part of the trip is at lower speed. Which is exactly how I approached it, so that's correct.

Another

---------------

 way to check: Let's say the answer options. 12.5 is option C, which is what I got. So I think that's correct. Let me see the options again. The options are A)10, B)11.5, C)12.5, D)13.5, E)15. So yes, C is there. 

Therefore

---------------

, the correct answer is C.


To determine the total journey duration, first calculate the total distance using the original speed and time:  
- **Total distance** = Speed × Time = 100 mph × 10 hours = **1000 miles**.  

The train covers the first quarter of this distance at 100 mph:  
- **First quarter distance** = 1000 × (1/4) = **250 miles**.  
- **Time for first quarter** = 250 miles ÷ 100 mph = **2.5 hours**.  

The remaining three-quarters of the distance is covered at 75 mph:  
- **Remaining distance** = 1000 − 250 = **750 miles**.  
- **Time for remaining distance** = 750 miles ÷ 75 mph = **10 hours**.  

**Total journey duration** = 2.5 hours + 10 hours = **12.5 hours**.  

Answer: C)12.5.
