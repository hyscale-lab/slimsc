Okay, let's see. The problem is about a cereal mixture with rice, wheat, and corn in the ratio 2:3:5. The question says that a bag has 3 pounds of rice, and we need to find out how much corn it contains. The options are given, but I'll have to work through it step by step.

First, ratios can sometimes be tricky. The ratio 2:3:5 corresponds to rice:wheat:corn. So for every 2 parts of rice, there are 3 parts wheat and 5 parts corn. The total parts would be 2 + 3 + 5, which is 10 parts. But maybe I don't need the total. Let me think.

Since the ratio of rice to corn is 2:5, that might be the key here. Because the question is linking rice directly to corn. Let me see. The ratio of rice is 2 parts, and corn is 5 parts. So if the actual amount of rice is 3 pounds, I can set up a proportion here.

Let me write that down. Let's let the parts be represented by a variable, say x. So the ratio parts are 2x for rice, 3x for wheat, and 5x for corn. Wait, that might be a better way to approach it. Because ratios can be thought of as multiples of a common variable. So if rice is 2x, then 2x equals the actual amount of rice given, which is 3 pounds. So solving for x would give me the value of each part. Then I can multiply that by 5 to get the corn amount.

Let me try that. So:

Rice = 2x = 3 pounds.

Solving for x: x = 3 / 2 = 1.5.

Then corn is 5x, so 5 * 1.5 = 7.5 pounds. Hmm, that would be option B. But wait, let me check if I did that right. Let me go through again.

The ratio is 2:3:5. So for

---------------

 every 2 units of rice, there are 5 of corn. So the ratio of rice to corn is 2:5. So if rice is 3, then corn would be (5/2)*rice. So 5/2 *3 is indeed (5*3)/2 = 15/2 =7.5. That's the same answer. So the answer should be B)7.5. But wait, let me check the options again. The options are A)6.5, B)7.5, C)7, D)6, E) None. So B is an option. So that's the answer?

Wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me try another approach. Let's think of the total parts. The total ratio is 2+3+5=10 parts. But maybe the problem is presented

---------------

 as a mixture where the ratios are parts by weight. So if rice is 2 parts, then each part is 3 pounds divided by 2, which is 1.5 pounds. So each part is 1.5. Then corn is 5 parts, so 5 * 1.5 =7.5. So that's correct. 

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me see if there's another way someone might get confused. For instance, maybe someone might think that the total is 10 parts and then

---------------

 try to find the total mixture first, but that's not necessary here. Since the ratio of rice to corn is directly proportional, the

---------------

 way I did it is correct.

Alternatively, someone might set up a proportion like rice/corn = 2/5, so 3/corn = 2/5. Solving for corn would be (3 *5)/2 = 7.5, which is the same. So yeah

---------------

, that's correct. So the answer should be B. 

But let me check again the options. The options list B as 7.5. So that's there

---------------

. So why is option E even an option? Maybe to trick people who miscalculate. But according to this, the correct answer is B. So

---------------

 the answer is B)7.5. I think that's right.


The cereal mixture has a ratio of rice:wheat:corn as 2:3:5. Given that rice is 3 pounds, we can

---------------

 determine the value of each part in the ratio. Let the common multiplier be \( x \). Then, rice is \( 2x = 3 \) pounds. Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \). Corn corresponds to \( 5x \), so substituting \( x \) gives \( 5 \times 1.5 = 7.5 \) pounds. This matches option B.
