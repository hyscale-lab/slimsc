Okay, let's see. The problem is about ratios in a cereal mixture. The ratio of rice, wheat, and corn is 2:3:5. And the question is, if there's 3 pounds of rice, how much corn is there? Hmm, ratios can sometimes trip me up, but let's think step by step.

So the ratio given is 2 parts rice, 3 parts wheat, and 5 parts corn. That adds up to a total of 10 parts, right? But maybe I don't need the total. Wait, the problem states that the actual amount of rice is 3 pounds. I need to find the corresponding amount of corn. 

Since the ratio is 2:3:5, the rice is 2 parts. Let me set up a proportion here. Let's let one part be represented by some variable. Let's say each part is x pounds. Then rice is 2x, wheat 3x, corn 5x. 

Given that rice is 3 pounds, so 2x = 3. Solving for x, that would be x = 3/2, which is 1.5. Then corn is 5x. So substituting x into

---------------

 that, 5 times 1.5 equals... 7.5? Oh wait, that's one of the options. Let me check the options again. Option B is 7.5. So that

---------------

 would be the answer? But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of ratios. The ratio of rice to corn is 2:5. So if rice is 3, then the corn would be (5/2)*3. Because if 2 parts correspond to 3, then each part is 1.5, so 5 parts would be 7.5. Yeah, that's the same as before. 

Hmm, so the answer should be B)7.5. Let me check the options again. The options are A)6.5, B)7.5, C)7, D)6, E)None. Since 7.5 is option B, that must be the correct answer. I don't see any errors in my calculations here. The key was to set up the ratio correctly and find the value per part. Yep, that makes sense.


The cereal mixture has a ratio of rice:wheat:corn = 2:3:5. Given that rice is 3 pounds, we first determine the value of one part. Since rice corresponds to 2 parts, each part is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) pounds. Corn corresponds to 5 parts, so the amount of corn is \( 5 \times 1.5 = 7.5 \) pounds. This matches option B.

Answer: B<|im_end|>
