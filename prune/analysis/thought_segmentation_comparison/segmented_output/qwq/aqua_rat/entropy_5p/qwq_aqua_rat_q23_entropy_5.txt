Okay, so I need to solve this problem where the total number of students in a class is a four-digit number. The fractions given are 1/16 for math, 1/10 for bio, and 1/8 for English. The question is asking for the difference between the maximum and minimum possible total number of students. Hmm, right.

First, I think the key here is that the number of students must be divisible by each of the denominators of

---------------

 those fractions. Because the number of students studying each subject has to be a whole number. So, the total number of students, let's call it N, must be a multiple of 16, 10, and 8. Because 1/16 N has to be an integer, same with the others.

Wait, so N has to be a common multiple of 16, 10, and 8. To find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers, maybe that's the starting point. Then the possible N's would be multiples of that LCM. Since N is a four-digit number, the minimum N would be the smallest four-digit number that's a multiple of the LCM, and the maximum would be the largest four-digit number that's a multiple of the LCM. Then subtract them to find the difference.

Let me compute the LCM of 16, 10, and 8. Breaking them into prime factors:

16 is 2^4,

10 is 2 × 5,

8 is 2^3.

The LCM takes the highest power of each prime. So for 2, the highest exponent is 4 (from 16), and for 5 it's 1 (from 10). So LCM is 2^4 × 5 = 16 ×5 = 80. Wait, is

---------------

 that right? Let me check again. 16 (2^4), 10 (2×5), 8 (2^3). The LCM must

---------------

 have 2^4, 5^1. So yes, 16×5=80. So LCM is 80. So N must be a multiple of 80.

So the total number of students has to be a multiple of 80. Now, the problem states that N is a four-digit number. So the smallest four-digit number divisible by 80 would be the first one after 1000. Let me see:

---------------

 1000 divided by 80 is 12.5, so the next integer is 13. 13×80=1040. That's the minimum possible N?

Wait, wait. Let me check 1000 divided by 80 is 12.5, so 12×80=960 which is three digits. So 13×80=1040, yes. That's the smallest four-digit number divisible by 80.

Now, the maximum four-digit number divisible by 80. The largest four-digit number is 9999. Let's divide that by 80. 9999 ÷80.

---------------

 Let's see, 80×124 = 9920 (since 120×80=9600; 4×80=320 → 9600+320=9920). Then 9920 +80=10000, which is five digits. So the maximum four-digit multiple of 80 would be 9920. Wait, but 9920 is less than 9999? Yes

---------------

. So 9920 is the maximum N?

Wait, but maybe 9920 is correct. Let me confirm. 80×124 is 9920, and 80×125 is 10,000 which is too big. So yes, 9920 is the maximum four-digit multiple of 80. So the minimum N is 1040, maximum 9920. The difference would be 9920 -1040 = 8880. Hmm, but option

---------------

 A is 8880. So that's the answer?

Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check the

---------------

 LCM calculation again. Because maybe I made a mistake there. Let me see:

The denominators are 16, 10, and 8. The

---------------

 LCM of these numbers. Let's compute LCM step by step. LCM of 16 and 10 first. LCM(16,10). 16 factors into 2^4, 10 is 2×5. LCM is 2^4 ×5 = 80. Then LCM of 80 and 8. Since 80 already includes 8 (since 80 is 16×5, which is 2^4 ×5, so 8 is a factor of 80). So LCM(80,8) is still 80. So yes, the LCM is indeed 80. So that part is correct.

So the minimum

---------------

 N is 1040 and maximum 9920. The difference between them is 9920 - 1040 = 8880. So that would be option A. But let me check the options again. The options are A)8880, B)8870, etc. So A

---------------

 is correct?

Wait, but wait another thought. The problem says "the total number of students is a four-digit number". So the minimum

---------------

 four-digit number divisible by 80 is 1040, correct. The maximum is 9920. So

---------------

 the difference is 8880. So the answer is A. That seems right. But let me check again.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe I missed something. Let me think again. Suppose the fractions of students studying each subject must be integers. So N must be divisible by 16, 10, and 8. So

---------------

 the LCM is 80. Therefore, N must be a multiple of 80. So the possible N are 1040, 1120, ..., up to 9920. So the maximum is

---------------

 9920, the minimum is 1040. Difference is 8880. So the answer should be A.

Hmm, but the

---------------

 options include 8880 as option A. So that must be correct. I think that's the right approach.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of students, \( N \), which must be a four-digit number and divisible by 16, 10, and 8 to ensure the number of students studying each subject is an integer. The least common multiple (LCM) of these denominators is calculated as follows:

- Prime factors of 16: \( 2^4 \)
- Prime factors of 10: \( 2 \times 5 \)
- Prime factors of 8: \( 2^3 \)

The LCM is obtained by taking the highest powers of all prime factors: \( 2^4 \times 5 = 16 \times 5 = 80 \). Thus, \( N \) must be a multiple of 80.

Next, we find the smallest and largest four-digit multiples of 80:
- The smallest four-digit multiple of 80 is \( 13 \times 80 = 1040 \) (since \( 12 \times 80 = 960 \) is a three-digit number).
- The largest four-digit multiple of 80 is \( 124 \times 80 = 9920 \) (since \( 125 \times 80 = 10000 \) exceeds four digits).

The difference between the maximum and minimum values of \( N \) is:
\[
9920 - 1040 = 8880
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **A**.
