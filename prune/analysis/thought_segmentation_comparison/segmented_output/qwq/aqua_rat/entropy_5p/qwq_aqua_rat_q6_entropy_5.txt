Okay, so I need to figure out how many distinct bike numbers can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers. And the question is asking how many letters need to be distinct. Wait, the

---------------

 options are numbers, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.

The question says: "Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?" Hmm, maybe I misread. Oh wait, perhaps the question is asking how many distinct letters are required?

---------------

 Or is it asking under the condition that the letters must be distinct? Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased as: when forming such a bike number (2 letters then 2 numbers), how many different letters

---------------

 must be used? Like, do the two letters have to be different from each other? Because that would affect the total number of combinations. The

---------------

 options given are numbers like 74453, etc., so perhaps the question is actually asking for the total number of possible distinct bike numbers under certain conditions. Wait, maybe I need to read the problem again carefully.

Wait, the first

---------------

 part says "Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s." Then the second part is "How many letters need to be distinct?" Hmm

---------------

, maybe the wording is confusing. Perhaps the question is actually a two-part question but presented as a single question here. Wait, maybe

---------------

 the actual question is to compute the total number of possible distinct bike numbers where the two letters must be distinct. Or maybe the question is asking

---------------

 whether the letters need to be distinct, but the options are numerical answers. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking

---------------

 for the total number of distinct bike numbers possible when the two letters can be the same or different, but the question is ph

---------------

rased as "how many letters need to be distinct"—maybe that's a mistranslation or misphrasing.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking

---------------

: when forming the license plate (2 letters followed by 2 numbers), how many distinct letters are required in total? But that also

---------------

 doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the question is actually "how many distinct letters are there in total such that...", but perhaps

---------------

 the original problem is in another language and the translation is a bit off. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the total number of possible license plates where the two letters must be distinct. Let

---------------

 me consider that possibility.

If that's the case, then the problem is: calculate the total number of distinct bike numbers (license plates) formed

---------------

 by 2 letters followed by 2 numbers, where the two letters must be distinct. The answer would be computed as follows.

Letters: assuming

---------------

 the English alphabet, 26 letters. Since they must be distinct, the first letter has 26 options, the second has 25. So letters part: 26 *25.

Numbers: assuming

---------------

 digits 0-9, each of the two numbers can be 0-9, so 10 options each. So numbers part: 10 *10 = 100.

Total combinations: 26*25 * 10*10 = 26*25*100. Let me calculate that. 26*25 is 650, times

---------------

 100 is 65,000. So that would be option D)65000. 



---------------

Alternatively, if the letters can be the same, then it would be 26*26 *10*10 = 26²*100 = 67,600. But since

---------------

 65,000 is one of the options (D), perhaps the question is indeed requiring the two letters to be distinct. Then

---------------

 the answer would be D.

Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased as "how many letters need to be distinct" as

---------------

 in how many different letters are required in the entire system? Like, the total number of distinct letters used across all possible plates? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps the question is inverting the problem. Wait, the way the question is written here is a bit confusing. Let me read

---------------

 again the exact wording.

The question is: "Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?" Wait

---------------

, the way it's written, perhaps the first part is the main question, and the second is a sub-question? But the options are numbers, so maybe the actual question is the

---------------

 first part, and the options are the possible answers, but the second part is part of the question. Wait, perhaps the question

---------------

 is mistyped. Maybe it's supposed to be "Find the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers. How many letters need to be distinct?" Hmm

---------------

, that still doesn't parse well. Wait maybe the question is asking for the total number, and the options are the numbers, and the second

---------------

 part is part of the problem. Like, "Find the total number... where the two letters must be distinct?" If that's the case, then the answer would be 26*25 * 10^2 = 65,000 which is D. Since

---------------

 D is an option, that must be the case.

Alternatively, if the letters can be the same, then the total would be 26^2*100 = 67,600 which is not listed here. The options given are A)74453, B)64543, C)74325, D)65000, E)97656. 65,000 is D. So that

---------------

 must be the correct answer if the letters must be distinct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking how many of the letters must be distinct (

---------------

like, whether they have to be or not), but that's a yes/no question, which the options don't fit. So I think the correct interpretation is that the question is asking for the total number of such bike numbers when the two letters must be distinct, so

---------------

 the calculation is 26 *25 *10*10=65,000, so D.


To determine the total number of distinct bike numbers formed by 2 letters followed by 2 numbers, we first consider the conditions. The problem implies the letters must be distinct because the question asks, "How many letters need to be distinct?" which likely means they must be distinct. 

For the letters: 
- The first letter has 26 options (assuming the English alphabet).
- The second letter must be different, leaving 25 options.
Total letter combinations: \(26 \times 25 = 650\).

For the numbers (digits 0-9):
- Each of the two digits has 10 options.
Total number combinations: \(10 \times 10 = 100\).

Multiplying these gives the total distinct bike numbers:
\(650 \times 100 = 65,000\).

The correct answer is **D**.
