Okay, let's see. The question is about the sales revenue of Ace Book Company. Last year, 34% of their sales were from novels. The remaining revenue, which would be 100% - 34% = 66%, came from other stuff. Out

---------------

 of that remaining 66%, a third was from biographies. So I need to find out how many times the revenue from novels is compared to biographies.

Hmm, let

---------------

 me break it down. Let's assume the total revenue is 100 units for simplicity. Then novels are 34 units. The remaining 66 units are split into other

---------------

 categories. The problem says 1/3 of the remaining is from biographies. So biographies would be (1/3)*66 = 22 units. Wait, so

---------------

 novels are 34, biographies 22. The question is asking how many times the novels' revenue is compared to biographies. So that would be 34 divided by 22,

---------------

 right?

Let me do that division. 34 รท 22 equals approximately 1.545... So

---------------

 looking at the options, that's closest to 1.5 (option B) or 2.1 (C)? Wait, 1.545 is closer

---------------

 to 1.5, since 1.5 is 1.5 and 2.1 is 2.1. The options given are A)1.3, B)1.5, C)2.1, D)2.5, E)3.1. So the

---------------

 closest would be B, 1.5. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let me check again. The remaining after novels is 66%,

---------------

 correct. Then 1/3 of that is for biographies. So 66 divided by 3 is indeed 22. So novels

---------------

 are 34, biographies 22. 34 divided by 22 is exactly 1.54545...

---------------

 So approximately, the question says "approximately". The options are B (1.5) and C (2.1). Since

---------------

 1.545 is closer to 1.5 than to 2.1, the answer should be B?



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the question. Let me read it again: "the revenue from the sale of novels was approximately how many times its revenue from biographies."

---------------

 So novels / biographies. 34 /22 is about 1.545. So the closest option

---------------

 is B, 1.5. 

But wait, maybe the remaining after novels is not 66% but 

---------------

66% of the total? Wait no, the problem says "of the remaining revenue, 1/3 was from biographies." The remaining after

---------------

 novels is 66% of total. So yes, that's correct. 

Hmm, so the answer should be B?

---------------

 Let me see the options again. The options are A through E, with B being 1.5 and C 2.1. So

---------------

 1.545 rounds to 1.5. So B is the right answer. 

Wait, maybe the

---------------

 question is tricky in another way. Let me think again. Suppose the remaining after novels is 66%, and of that, 1/3 is biographies, so 

---------------

22% as before. The novels are 34% of total, biographies are 22% of the remaining 

---------------

66? Wait no, 1/3 of the remaining (66%) is biographies, so that's (1/3)*66% of total.

---------------

 So biographies are 22% of total revenue. Then novels are 34% divided by 22% of

---------------

 total, which is 34/22. So that's correct. 

Therefore, the answer is B)1.5. Because

---------------

 34 divided by 22 is approximately 1.545, which is closest to 1.5. The

---------------

 options don't have 1.55, so between B and C, B is closer. So I think the correct answer is B.


To determine how many times the revenue from novels was

---------------

 compared to biographies, we start by noting that novels accounted for 34% of total revenue. The remaining revenue is 100% - 34% = 66%. Of this remaining 66%, one

---------------

-third (1/3) was from biographies. Calculating the biography revenue:  
\[
\text{Biographies} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66\% = 22\% \text{ of total revenue}.
\]  
The novels

---------------

' revenue (34%) is then divided by the biographies' revenue (22%) to find the ratio:  
\[
\frac{34\%}{22\%} \approx 1.545.
\]  
The closest approximation among the options is **1.5** (Option B).
