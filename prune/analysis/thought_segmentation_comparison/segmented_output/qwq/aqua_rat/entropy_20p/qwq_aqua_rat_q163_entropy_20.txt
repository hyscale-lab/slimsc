Okay, let's see. The problem is asking for the greatest number of identical bouquets we can make using 28 white tulips and 98 red tulips, and

---------------

 none of the flowers can be left out. Hmm, right. So identical bouquets mean that each bouquet has the same number of white and red tulips. 

So

---------------

, I think this is a greatest common divisor (GCD) problem. Because the idea is to divide both numbers of flowers into groups where each group has the same count

---------------

. The GCD of 28 and 98 should give the maximum number of bouquets possible. Let me confirm

---------------

 that.

The GCD is the largest number that can divide both numbers without leaving a remainder. So, first, let's find the GCD of 28 and 98. Let's break them down into prime factors.

28 factors: 2 × 14 →

---------------

 2 × 2 × 7. So 2² × 7¹.

98 factors: 2 × 49 → 2 × 7 × 7. So 2¹ × 7².

The GCD takes the minimum exponents of the common primes. So for 2, the minimum exponent is 1 (since 28 has 2² and 98 has 2¹),

---------------

 and for 7 it's the minimum of 1 and 2, which is 1. So GCD is 2 ×7 =14. 

Wait, but let

---------------

 me check that. So 14 divides both 28 and 98. 28 divided by 14 is exactly 2, and 98 divided by 14 is exactly 7. So that

---------------

 works. So if we make 14 bouquets, each would have 2 white tulips and 7 red ones. That

---------------

 uses up all the flowers. 

Looking at the options, D is 14. So that's the answer? Let me make

---------------

 sure there isn't a higher number. Wait, what if someone thought maybe 21? But 21 divides 28? Let's see.

---------------

 28 divided by 21 is less than 2, so that would leave some flowers. 21 doesn

---------------

't divide 28. So no. 7 is an option. Let me see. GCD is 14, which is higher than 7, so 14 is

---------------

 better. So the answer should be D)14.


To determine the greatest number of identical bouquets using all 28 white and 98 red tulips, we need the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 28 and 98. 

Prime factorization:
- 28 = 2² × 7¹
- 98 = 2¹ × 7²

The GCD is the

---------------

 product of the minimum exponents of shared prime factors: 2¹ × 7¹ = 14. 

Ver

---------------

ifying: 14 bouquets would each contain 28/14 = 2 white tulips and 98/14 = 7 red tulips, with no flowers left. 



---------------

Options like 21 or 7 are smaller than 14 and thus not optimal. 

Answer: D)14.
