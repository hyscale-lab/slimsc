Okay, so I need to figure out how many distinct bike numbers can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers. And

---------------

 the question is asking how many letters need to be distinct. Wait, the options are numbers, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.

The

---------------

 question says: "Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?" Hmm, maybe I mis

---------------

read. Oh wait, perhaps the question is asking how many distinct letters are required? Or is it asking under the condition that the letters must be distinct? Let

---------------

 me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased as: when forming such a bike number (2 letters then 2 numbers), how many different

---------------

 letters must be used? Like, do the two letters have to be different from each other? Because that would affect the total number of combinations. The

---------------

 options given are numbers like 74453, etc., so perhaps the question is actually asking for the total number of possible distinct bike numbers under

---------------

 certain conditions. Wait, maybe I need to read the problem again carefully.

Wait, the first part says "Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s." Then

---------------

 the second part is "How many letters need to be distinct?" Hmm, maybe the wording is confusing. Perhaps the question is actually

---------------

 a two-part question but presented as a single question here. Wait, maybe the actual question is to compute the total number of possible

---------------

 distinct bike numbers where the two letters must be distinct. Or maybe the question is asking whether the letters need to be distinct,

---------------

 but the options are numerical answers. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the total number of

---------------

 distinct bike numbers possible when the two letters can be the same or different, but the question is phrased as "how many letters need to be distinct"—

---------------

maybe that's a mistranslation or misphrasing.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking: when forming the license plate (

---------------

2 letters followed by 2 numbers), how many distinct letters are required in total? But that also doesn't make sense. Wait

---------------

, perhaps the question is actually "how many distinct letters are there in total such that...", but perhaps the original problem is in

---------------

 another language and the translation is a bit off. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the total number of possible license plates where

---------------

 the two letters must be distinct. Let me consider that possibility.

If that's the case, then the problem is: calculate

---------------

 the total number of distinct bike numbers (license plates) formed by 2 letters followed by 2 numbers, where the two letters must be distinct. The

---------------

 answer would be computed as follows.

Letters: assuming the English alphabet, 26 letters. Since they must be distinct, the first letter has 26 options, the second has 25. So letters part: 26 *25.

Numbers: assuming

---------------

 digits 0-9, each of the two numbers can be 0-9, so 10 options each. So numbers part: 10 *10 = 100.

Total combinations: 26*25 * 10*10 = 

---------------

26*25*100. Let me calculate that. 26*25 is 650, times

---------------

 100 is 65,000. So that would be option D)65000. 



---------------

Alternatively, if the letters can be the same, then it would be 26*26 *10*10 = 26²*100 = 67,600. But since

---------------

 65,000 is one of the options (D), perhaps the question is indeed requiring the two letters to be distinct. Then

---------------

 the answer would be D.

Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased as "how many letters need to be distinct"

---------------

 as in how many different letters are required in the entire system? Like, the total number of distinct letters used across all possible

---------------

 plates? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question is inverting the problem. Wait, the way the question is written here

---------------

 is a bit confusing. Let me read again the exact wording.

The question is: "Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?" Wait

---------------

, the way it's written, perhaps the first part is the main question, and the second is a sub-question? But

---------------

 the options are numbers, so maybe the actual question is the first part, and the options are the possible answers, but the second

---------------

 part is part of the question. Wait, perhaps the question is mistyped. Maybe it's supposed to be "Find the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers. How many letters need to be distinct?" Hmm

---------------

, that still doesn't parse well. Wait maybe the question is asking for the total number, and the options are the numbers

---------------

, and the second part is part of the problem. Like, "Find the total number... where the two letters must be distinct?"

---------------

 If that's the case, then the answer would be 26*25 * 10^2 = 65,000 which

---------------

 is D. Since D is an option, that must be the case.

Alternatively, if the letters can be the same, then the

---------------

 total would be 26^2*100 = 67,600 which is not listed here

---------------

. The options given are A)74453, B)64543, C)74325, D)65000, E)97656. 

---------------

65,000 is D. So that must be the correct answer if the letters must be distinct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question

---------------

 is asking how many of the letters must be distinct (like, whether they have to be or not), but that's a yes/no question,

---------------

 which the options don't fit. So I think the correct interpretation is that the question is asking for the total number of such

---------------

 bike numbers when the two letters must be distinct, so the calculation is 26 *25 *10*10=65,000,

---------------

 so D.


To determine the total number of distinct bike numbers formed by 2 letters followed by 2 numbers, we first

---------------

 consider the conditions. The problem implies the letters must be distinct because the question asks, "How many letters need to be distinct?" which

---------------

 likely means they must be distinct. 

For the letters: 
- The first letter has 26 options (assuming the English alphabet).
- The second letter must be different, leaving 25 options.
Total letter combinations: \(26 \times 25 = 650\).

For the numbers (digits 0-9):
- Each of the two digits

---------------

 has 10 options.
Total number combinations: \(10 \times 10 = 100\).

Multiplying these gives the total distinct bike numbers:
\(650 \times 100 = 65,000\).

The

---------------

 correct answer is **D**.
