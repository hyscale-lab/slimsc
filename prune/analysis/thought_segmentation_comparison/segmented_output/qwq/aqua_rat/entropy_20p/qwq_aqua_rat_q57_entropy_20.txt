Okay, let's see. The problem is about percentages of chocolates being cocoa or vanilla flavored and whether they're squashed. Hmm. Alright

---------------

, so first, all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa. So that's two categories. The first piece of information is that 10% are cocoa flavored. That means 90% must be vanilla, right?

Then the next part says 90% of the rest are squashed. Wait, "

---------------

the rest" here refers to what? Let me parse that again. The question is asking for the percentage that's both vanilla and not squashed.

So

---------------

 let me break it down step by step. Let's assume there are 100 chocolates in total to make percentages easier. 



---------------

First, 10% are cocoa, so that's 10 chocolates. The remaining 90 must be vanilla. Now

---------------

, the next part: 90% of the rest are squashed. Wait, "the rest" probably refers to the remaining after the cocoa ones. So the rest would

---------------

 be the 90 vanilla chocolates. So 90% of those 90 are squashed. Let me calculate that.

---------------

 90% of 90 is 81. So 81 of the vanilla are squashed. That

---------------

 means the number of vanilla not squashed would be 90 total vanilla minus 81 squashed, which is 9. So 9 out of 100 total chocolates are

---------------

 vanilla and not squashed. So that's 9%, which is option D. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Let

---------------

 me make sure I didn't misinterpret "the rest". The problem says "90% of the rest are squashed". The first

---------------

 part took away 10% cocoa, so the rest is 90% of the total. So yes, that

---------------

 rest is the 90% (vanilla), so 90% of that 90% is 0.9 * 90% = 81%

---------------

 squashed. So the vanilla not squashed would be 90% - 81% = 9%. So

---------------

 the answer should be D)9%. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the interpretation. Let me try another way. Suppose "the rest" after cocoa is

---------------

 90%, and 90% of all chocolates (the total) are squashed? No, that doesn't fit the wording. The wording says "90% of the rest are squashed".

---------------

 So the rest refers to the remaining 90% (non-cocoa), so yes, 90% of that 

---------------

90% is squashed. Therefore, the vanilla not squashed is 10% of the 90% (since 90% are

---------------

 squashed, so 10% not squashed of the vanilla). 10% of 90 is 9. So

---------------

 that's correct. So answer D.


To solve the problem, start by considering a total of 100 chocolates for simplicity. 

1. **Cocoa-flavored chocolates**: 10% of 100 = 10 chocolates.  
2. **Vanilla-flavored chocolates**: The remaining 90% = 90 chocolates.  

Next, the

---------------

 problem states that **90% of the rest (the vanilla-flavored chocolates)** are squashed:  
3. **Squashed vanilla chocolates**: 90% of 90 = 81 chocolates.  
4. **Non-squashed vanilla chocolates**: Total vanilla (90) − Squashed vanilla (81) = 9 chocolates.  

Thus, **9% of the total chocolates** are both vanilla-flavored and not squashed.  

Answer: D)9%
