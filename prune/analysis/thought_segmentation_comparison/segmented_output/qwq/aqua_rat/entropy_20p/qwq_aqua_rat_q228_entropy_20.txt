Okay, let's tackle this problem. So the question is about a positive integer Q that has exactly 5 factors. We need to determine which of the statements I, II, or III must be true.

First, I remember that the number of factors of a number relates to its prime factorization. The formula for the number of divisors is if

---------------

 a number N is expressed as (p^a)(q^b)(r^c)... then the number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc. So since

---------------

 Q has 5 factors, we need to find what form its prime factors must take.

Hmm, 5 is a prime number here

---------------

. So the product of (exponents +1) must equal 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way to write this as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 itself. So that means that the number

---------------

 must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime. Because then the exponents plus one would be 4+1=5. Wait

---------------

, but wait, another possibility? Like maybe two primes with exponents such that (a+1)(b+1) =5? But since 5 is prime, the only factors are 1 and 5. So the

---------------

 exponents plus one would have to be 5 and 1, but since exponents are at least 1, that

---------------

 would require one exponent being 4 and another exponent being 0, but primes can't have exponent 0. So the

---------------

 only way is that the number is a single prime raised to the 4th power. Wait, or maybe a square of a prime?

Wait a

---------------

 second, let me think again. Wait, if Q is the square of a prime, like pÂ², then the number of factors would be 2+1=3. But

---------------

 3 isn't 5. So that's not possible. Wait, so maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, so

---------------

 the question says 5 factors. Let me recalculate. Let's see, for example, if the number is p^4, then the

---------------

 exponents plus one is 4+1=5, so yes, that gives exactly 5 factors. Alternatively, could

---------------

 it be a product of two different primes? Let's see. Suppose Q = p * q, where p and q are distinct primes. Then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1) =4, which is not 5. So that's not

---------------

 it. 

Alternatively, if the number is p^2 * q^1, then the factors would be (2+1)(1+1)=6

---------------

, which is more than 5. So that's not. 

Hmm, so the only possible way is that the number is of

---------------

 the form p^4, where p is prime. Because then the exponents plus one is 5. So that would mean that statement

---------------

 II says "Q is the fourth power of a prime number", which would be true. 

Wait but the first statement says

---------------

 Q is the square of a prime. Wait, if it's a square of a prime, like p squared, then the

---------------

 number of factors is 3, not 5. So that would not be the case. So statement I is not necessarily true.

---------------

 Wait, but wait, maybe I messed up?

Let me check with examples. Let's take a prime number p, say 2. Then

---------------

 2^4 is 16. The factors of 16 are 1,2,4,8,16. That's 5 factors. So yes

---------------

, that works. So 16 is a fourth power of a prime and has 5 factors. So in that case, statement II is correct. 

But

---------------

 what about if Q was the square of a prime? Let's say 3 squared is 9. The factors of 9 are 1,3,9. Only three factors, so that's not 5. So statement

---------------

 I would not hold here. Therefore, I is not necessarily true. 

Then statement III says Q is the product of two prime numbers. Well

---------------

, if Q is p^4, like 16, which is 2^4, then it's not the product of two different primes. It

---------------

's a single prime raised to the fourth power. So the product of two primes would be like 2*3=6, which has four factors, so

---------------

 that's not. So III is not true either. 

Wait, but the options given are: 

I. Q is the square of a prime number

---------------

. (Which would be p^2, which gives 3 factors, so not applicable here.)

II. Q is the fourth power of a prime. Which is

---------------

 correct.

III. Q is product of two primes. Which would give four factors, so no.

Therefore, only statement II must be true. So

---------------

 the answer would be option C. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. The

---------------

 question says "must be true about Q". So if Q must be a fourth power of a prime, then II must be true, but

---------------

 are there any other possibilities?

Wait, the number of factors is 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way to

---------------

 get (exponents plus one) product is 5. So the exponent plus one must be 5, so exponent is 4. So the number must be p

---------------

^4. So there are no other forms. So the only possible form is a prime to the fourth power. Therefore II is correct, and

---------------

 I and III are not. 

So the correct answer should be C) II only. 

Wait, but let me check

---------------

 the options again. The options are A)I only, B)III only, C)II only, D)I and II only, E)I and III only.

So

---------------

 yes, C is the right answer here. So I think that's the conclusion. Wait but wait, wait another thought. The

---------------

 question says "must be true". So if the number is the fourth power of a prime, then is that the only possibility

---------------

? 

Alternatively, is there any other way the number could have five factors? Let me think. Suppose there's a number with three different exponents?

---------------

 Like, for example, if the exponents are such that (a+1)(b+1) =5. But 5 is prime, so the

---------------

 only factors are 5 and 1. So the only possible way is one exponent of 4 and the rest zero. So it

---------------

 must be a single prime to the fourth power. 

Therefore, yes, II must be true, I and III are not. So the answer is C.


To determine which statements must be true about Q, a positive integer with exactly 5 factors, we analyze the prime

---------------

 factorization of Q. The number of factors of a number \( N = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \cdots p_k^{a_k} \) is given by \((a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \cdots (a_k + 1)\). Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to express 

---------------

5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is \(5 = 5 \times 1\). This implies that Q must be of the form \( p^4 \) where \( p \) is a prime number. 

- **Statement I**: Q is the square of a prime number.  
  If Q were \( p^2 \), it would have \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) factors, not 5. Thus, this is false.  

- **Statement II**: Q is the fourth power of a prime number.  
  This

---------------

 is true because \( p^4 \) has \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) factors.  

- **Statement III**: Q is the product of two prime numbers.  
  If Q were the product of two distinct primes \(

---------------

 p \times q \), it would have \( (1+1)(1+1) = 4 \) factors, which is insufficient. Thus

---------------

, this is false.  

Only Statement II must be true.
