Okay, so the problem here is about figuring out how long it takes the worker to cycle to work when they know the driving time and speed. Let me think through

---------------

 this step by step. 

First, the worker drives at 20 km/h and takes 9 minutes. I need to find the time it takes when cycling at 6 km/h. Hmm, right, this is a distance, speed, time problem. The key is

---------------

 that the distance from home to work doesn't change, right? So the distance when driving should be the same as when cycling. 

Wait

---------------

, the formula I remember is distance equals speed multiplied by time. So, distance = speed × time. 

But the units here are a bit different. The speed is in km per hour, and the time is given in minutes. Oh right, I need to convert the time to hours to match the units. Let me do

---------------

 that first.

So when driving, the time is 9 minutes. To convert that to hours, divide by 60. 9 divided by 60 is 0.15 hours. Then the distance would be 20 km/h multiplied by 0.15 hours. Let me calculate that. 20 times 0.15 is 3. So the distance is 3 kilometers. 



---------------

Wait, that makes sense? Let me check: 20 km per hour means in one hour, you go 20 km. So in 9 minutes, which is a quarter of an hour (since 60 minutes in an hour, 9 is like 0.15),

---------------

 so 20 * 0.15 = 3. Yeah, that's correct. The distance is 3 km.

Now, when cycling, the speed is 6 km/h. So we

---------------

 need to find the time it takes to go 3 km at 6 km/h. Using the same formula, time = distance / speed. So 

---------------

3 km divided by 6 km/h. That would be 0.5 hours. Oh wait, 0.5 hours is 30 minutes. Wait

---------------

, but 3 divided by 6 is 0.5. So 0.5 hours. 

But the question asks for the time in minutes. So 0.5 hours multiplied by 60 minutes per hour is

---------------

 30 minutes. So the answer should be 30, which is option A. 

Wait a second, but let me double

---------------

-check. Maybe I made a mistake in converting units somewhere. Let me go through again. 

Original driving scenario: 20 km/h for 9 minutes. 



---------------

Distance = speed × time. The time in hours is 9/60 = 0.15. 20 * 0.15 = 3 km. That

---------------

's right. 

Cycling: speed 6 km/h. Time needed is 3 km divided by 6 km/h equals

---------------

 0.5 hours. 0.5 *60 =30 minutes. So yes, 30 minutes

---------------

. So the answer is A. 

Hmm, but let me check the options again. The options are A)30, B)32, C)35, D)36, E)40. So A is an

---------------

 option. 

Wait, maybe I messed up the initial calculation. Let me see another way. Let's see, if he

---------------

 cycles slower, it should take longer than driving. Since driving is 20 km/h takes 9 minutes, cycling at 6 km/h is slower, so time should be longer. Wait, but 30 is longer than 9, so

---------------

 that's okay. Wait, but 30 is much longer. Let me think again. 

Wait, maybe I made

---------------

 a mistake in the distance. Let me recalculate. 

If the worker drives for 9 minutes at 20 km/h, how

---------------

 far is that?

Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula time = distance/speed. 

Alternatively, maybe think in terms of ratios. Since speed and time are inversely proportional when distance is constant. 

So the ratio of speeds is 20:6, which simplifies to 10:3. Therefore, the ratio of times should be inverse, 3:10. 

Wait, let

---------------

 me explain. Let me denote the driving time as t1 =9 minutes, speed v1=20. Cycling speed v2=6, time t2 is what we need. 

Since distance is same: v1 * t1 = v2 * t2. 

Wait, but the

---------------

 units here: the times here are in minutes, but the speeds are in km per hour. Hmm, maybe that complicates the

---------------

 ratio approach. 

Alternatively, let's write the equation properly. 

Distance when driving: (20 km/h) * (9/60 h) = 3 km,

---------------

 as before. 

Distance when cycling is same 3 km. So time in hours is 3 /6 = 0.5 h, which is 30 minutes. So that

---------------

's correct. 

Hmm. So the answer is A)30. But wait, why is option E 40? Maybe I

---------------

 made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me think again. 

Wait, perhaps I messed up the driving time calculation. Let me see

---------------

: 20 km per hour. So in one hour (60 minutes), he can go 20 km. So in 9 minutes, he

---------------

 goes (20 km)/60 min *9 min = 3 km. That's correct. 

So cycling at 6 km per hour.

---------------

 To go 3 km, time is 3 /6 hours. 3 divided by 6 is 0.5 hours. 0.5 *

---------------

60 is 30 minutes. So yes, that's right. 

Hmm, maybe the answer is A. So

---------------

 why are there other options? Let me see if the question says "along the same route", so distance is same. The

---------------

 options must have common mistakes. Like maybe someone forgets to convert minutes to hours. Let me see. 

Suppose someone does

---------------

 20 km/h for 9 minutes. They might incorrectly calculate distance as 20 *9 = 180, but that would be wrong

---------------

 because the time isn't in hours. So if someone did that, then the distance would be 180 km, which

---------------

 would be way off. Then cycling at 6 km/h, time would be 180/6 =30 hours, which is 1800 minutes, which is not an option. 

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 someone thought to use the ratio approach but messed up. Let's see. 

The speed ratio is 20:6 =

---------------

 10:3. Since time is inversely proportional, the time ratio would be 3:10. So driving

---------------

 time is 9, so cycling time would be (3/10)* driving time? Wait no, the ratio would

---------------

 be (v1/v2) = (t2/t1). Because distance is same, so v1 t1 = v2 t2 → t2 = (v1 /v2)

---------------

 * t1. 

Ah, right. So t2 = (20 /6) * 9 minutes. Let

---------------

 me calculate that. 20 divided by 6 is (10/3). So 10/3 multiplied by 9 is

---------------

 (10*9)/3 = 30. So that's the same answer. So that's another way to get 30. 

So the

---------------

 answer is 30, option A. 

Hmm, okay I think that's solid. The answer must be A.


To determine the time it takes to cycle to work, first calculate the distance using the driving details

---------------

. The worker drives at 20 km/h for 9 minutes. Converting 9 minutes to hours:  
\[
\text{Time (hours)} = \frac{9}{60} = 0.15 \text{ hours}
\]  
The distance is then:  
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \, \text{km/h} \times 0.15 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{km}
\]  

Next, calculate the cycling time using the same distance (3 km) and a cycling speed of 6 km/h:  
\[
\text{Time (hours)} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{3 \, \text{km}}{6 \, \text{km/h}} = 0.5 \, \text{hours}
\]  
Convert this time back to minutes:  
\[
0.5 \, \text{hours} \times 60 \, \text{minutes/hour} = 30 \, \text{minutes}
\]  

The

---------------

 answer is **30 minutes**, corresponding to option **A**.
