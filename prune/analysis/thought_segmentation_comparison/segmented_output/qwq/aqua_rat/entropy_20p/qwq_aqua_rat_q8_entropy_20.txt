Okay, so I need to figure out the maximum number of students who didn't attend either the prom or the debating session. Let's see. The school has 200 students total. The problem states that at least 45% went to the prom and at least 35% participated in the debating session. 



---------------

Hmm, the question is asking for the maximum number who did neither. To maximize the number of students who missed both events, I should

---------------

 minimize the number who attended at least one of them. Since the problem gives minimum percentages for each event, the way to minimize the overlap between

---------------

 the two groups (so that as few as possible students are in either group) would be best.

Wait, right. Because if the two groups (prom and debating) have as little overlap as possible, then the total number of students attending either event would be as large as possible?

---------------

 Wait, no, actually, wait. Wait, no, actually, to minimize the total number attending either, we want to

---------------

 maximize the overlap. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the problem says "at least" 45% and "at least" 35%. So the actual numbers could be higher. To find the maximum number of students who didn't attend either, we need the minimal

---------------

 possible number of students who attended at least one of the events. Because the more students that attended either, the fewer are left for

---------------

 neither. So, to maximize the neither, we need the minimal number that attended either.

To get the minimal number attending either, the two groups (prom and debating) should overlap as much as possible. Because the

---------------

 overlap reduces the total. For example, if all the debating participants were also at the prom, then the total is just the prom's

---------------

 number. But since the prom has a higher minimum, that might be the case. 

Let me recall the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. The total number attending either is A

---------------

 + B - both. To minimize this total, we need to maximize the overlap (both). Because the more overlap, the smaller the total.

---------------

 

So, the minimal possible total is when the overlap is as large as possible. The maximum possible overlap is the smaller of the two groups. Wait

---------------

, the minimum of A and B? Let's see. Let me think numerically here.

First, let's compute the minimum percentages.

---------------

 45% of 200 is 90 students for the prom (since 200 * 0.45 = 90). The

---------------

 debating is at least 35%, which is 70 students (200 * 0.35 = 70). 

So

---------------

 the prom has at least 90, debating at least 70. To find the minimal total, we can arrange

---------------

 that all of the 70 in debating are also in the prom. Then the total is 90. So the

---------------

 total attending either is 90, so the number not attending either is 200 - 90 = 110. But wait, that

---------------

 can't be right because the options include 110 as an option (E). But maybe I'm making a mistake here.



---------------

Wait, but the problem says "at least" 45% and "at least" 35%. So the

---------------

 actual numbers could be higher. Wait, but when trying to find the minimal possible total, you set the numbers to the minimums

---------------

. Because if you set them higher, that would make the total higher, which isn't what we want. 

So if

---------------

 we set prom to exactly 90 and debating to exactly 70, then the maximum overlap would be 70 (since the

---------------

 debating group can all be part of the prom group). So total attending either is 90 + 70 - 70 = 90. Then

---------------

 the number not attending either is 200 -90 = 110. But that's option E. But the

---------------

 options also have 99 and others. Wait, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait the problem says "at least 45% attended the prom" and "at least 35% took part in the debating". So the actual

---------------

 numbers could be higher, but to find the maximum number who didn't attend either, we need the minimal total attendees. So

---------------

 that would require the minimal possible overlap between the two groups. Wait, no. Wait, no, to get the minimal total attendees

---------------

, you want maximum overlap, right? Because overlapping reduces the total.

Wait let me rephrase. Let me think of it

---------------

 as:

The minimal possible number who attended either event is (A + B) - (maximum possible overlap). The maximum possible overlap is

---------------

 the minimum of A and B. Wait, actually the maximum possible overlap between A and B is the smaller of the two numbers

---------------

. So, in this case, if A is 90 and B is 70, then the maximum overlap is

---------------

 70. So the minimal total is 90 +70 -70 =90. So 90 is

---------------

 the minimal total. 

Therefore the maximum number not attending either is 200-90=110. But

---------------

 the options include E) 110, but the problem is that the question says "at least 45% and at least 35%". So

---------------

 if the school has exactly 90 and 70, then that's okay. But maybe there's a constraint I

---------------

'm missing here. 

Wait, but wait, maybe the problem is that when you set the prom to exactly 90 and debating to exactly 70, the

---------------

 overlap can't be more than 70, so that's okay. But maybe there's another consideration. For example, could

---------------

 there be a scenario where even if the overlapping is maximized, the total is higher?

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error here. Let me check

---------------

 the question again. The question says "the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session".

---------------

 So the maximum possible number is when the number who attended either is as small as possible. 

So according to the calculation, that

---------------

 would be 110. But why is there an option E as 110, which would be the answer here

---------------

. However, looking at the options, E is 110, but the other options are lower. But maybe I

---------------

 made a mistake here. Let me see.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read again.

---------------

 The problem states "at least 45% attended the prom" and "at least 35% took part in the debating". So the actual

---------------

 numbers could be higher, but the minimal numbers are 90 and 70. 

So, if we want to find

---------------

 the maximum possible number of students who didn't attend either, that requires that as few as possible attended at least one of the two. To

---------------

 minimize the number who attended either, we set the numbers to their minimal values (90 and 70), and maximize

---------------

 their overlap. So the total is 90 +70 - overlap. To minimize total, maximize overlap. The maximum possible overlap here

---------------

 is 70 (since debating is only 70, so all of them can be part of the prom attendees). So

---------------

 the total is 90, so 200 -90 = 110. So that would be the

---------------

 maximum possible for neither. 

But looking at the options, E is 110. However, the options given include

---------------

 110 as an option, but I feel like maybe the question is a bit tricky here. Wait, but perhaps

---------------

 the problem is that the percentages are given as "at least", so the actual numbers could be higher, but to get the maximum number

---------------

 who didn't attend either, you have to choose the minimal possible numbers for each, and maximize their overlap. So that calculation

---------------

 gives 110, which is E. 

But maybe there's an error here. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming

---------------

 that the overlap can be exactly 70. Because the prom has exactly 90, so the debating's 70 can all be within

---------------

 that 90. That's possible. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another constraint. For instance, the problem says "at least 45%", so the

---------------

 prom could have more than 90, but if you set it to 90, then you can get the minimal total. So

---------------

 that's okay. 

Hmm. Let me think of another approach. Let me use variables. Let P be the number who attended prom, D the number who debated. We

---------------

 know that P ≥ 90, D ≥70. We need to find the minimal possible value of P + D - both

---------------

, so that the maximum of 200 - (P+D - both). To minimize P+D - both, since

---------------

 both can be as high as possible. The maximum possible both is the minimum of P and D. But since P and D can be at

---------------

 minimum 90 and 70 respectively, the maximum possible overlap is 70. So the minimal total is 90 +70 -70 =90. So

---------------

 200-90=110. 

Therefore the answer should be E. But the options given include

---------------

 E as 110. However, the options also have 99, which is close to 100. Wait

---------------

, maybe I'm missing something here. Wait, perhaps the question is interpreted differently. Let me check again.

Wait the question says "at least 45% attended the prom" and

---------------

 "at least 35% took part in the debating". So the minimal numbers are 90 and 70, but

---------------

 maybe the problem is that the two "at least" conditions can't be both set to their minimums at the same time? Like

---------------

, maybe the percentages are of the total students, but if you have overlapping, perhaps that affects the minimums? I don't think so. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where you can't have both percentages at their minimums because of overlapping? Let

---------------

 me see. Suppose that 45% is the minimum for prom. So 90 students. And 35% is

---------------

 the minimum for debating, so 70. The overlap can be as high as 70. So the total is

---------------

 90, so the remaining is 110. That's correct. 

Wait, but why is the option E

---------------

 here? The options are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110. So E

---------------

 is an option, so that must be the correct answer. 

Hmm, maybe I was overcomplicating, but according

---------------

 to the math, that's correct. So the answer must be E)110. 

Wait, but maybe I

---------------

 made a mistake here. Let me think of an example. Suppose exactly 90 went to prom and exactly 70 to debate. All

---------------

 70 debate attendees are also at the prom. So total attendees are 90. Thus, 200-90=110 didn't attend either. 



---------------

Alternatively, if the debate attendees are all in the prom, then that's okay. So that scenario is possible. Therefore the

---------------

 maximum possible is 110, so E is correct. 

But why are other options present? Let me see.

---------------

 For instance, if someone thought that the maximum overlap can't exceed 90 (the prom's minimum), but the debate's

---------------

 minimum is 70. So the overlap can't be more than 70. So the calculation holds. 

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The problem says "the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom nor the debating session". So the

---------------

 maximum possible is 110. So the answer must be E. 

Hmm. Maybe I should check another approach. Let me think

---------------

 of the formula for the maximum possible number not in either set. 

The formula for the minimal number in either set is P

---------------

 + D - min(P, D) when the overlap is maximum. So minimal total is max(P, D). Because if one

---------------

 is a subset of the other. So in this case, since P is 90 and D is 70, the minimal total is 90. 



---------------

Hence, 200 -90 =110. 

Therefore the correct answer should be E.


To determine the maximum number of students who neither attended the prom nor the debating session, we need to minimize the number of students who attended at least one of the events. 

Given:
- At

---------------

 least 45% (90 students) attended the prom.
- At least 35% (70 students) participated in the debating session.

To minimize the total number of students attending either event, we maximize the overlap between the two groups. The maximum possible overlap occurs when all 70 debating participants are also among the 90 prom attendees. This

---------------

 results in a total of **90 students** attending at least one event (since the debating group is entirely contained within the prom group). 

Thus, the number of students who attended neither event is:  
\

---------------

[
200 - 90 = 110.
\]

The answer is **E) 110**, as this scenario

---------------

 is achievable and aligns with the constraints provided.
