Okay, so John wants his tea to be lightly flavored, right? The problem is about mixing milk into his tea. Let me see

---------------

. The initial solution is 50% strong milk tea. Wait, maybe I should parse the question again carefully.

The question says: In a 50% strong milk tea, he replaces 15% of it with milk twice. Then replaces 10% of the resultant solution with more milk. Need

---------------

 to find the final concentration of tea.

Hmm. Let's break this down step by step. Let me think of this as a mixture

---------------

 problem where each time he replaces a portion of the solution with milk. The key here is that when he replaces part of the solution with milk, he's dil

---------------

uting the tea concentration.

First, the initial concentration is 50% tea. Let's assume the total volume is 

---------------

100 units for simplicity. Because percentages are relative, the actual volume might not matter as long as we track the proportions

---------------

 correctly.

First step: He replaces 15% of it with milk. So initially, the solution is 50% tea and

---------------

 50% milk (since it's 50% strong milk tea? Wait, maybe I need to clarify.

---------------

 The wording is a bit ambiguous. "50% strong milk tea" probably means that the tea concentration is 50%, so the rest is milk. So the

---------------

 initial mixture is 50% tea and 50% milk. So starting with 100 units, there

---------------

's 50 tea and 50 milk.

Wait, but maybe the 50% is the strength of the tea.

---------------

 Like, maybe the milk tea is made with 50% tea and 50% milk. That's probably right

---------------

.

First replacement: he replaces 15% of the solution with milk. Let me think. Replacing 15% of the solution

---------------

 would mean removing 15% of the current mixture and then adding 15% milk. Since it's replacing, so

---------------

 first, he takes out 15% of the original solution (which is 50% tea), and then adds back 15% milk.

---------------

 So the total volume remains the same, but the concentration changes.

Wait, the process is similar to the mixture problems where each time you take out a portion and replace it with another substance

---------------

. The formula for concentration after each step is important here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to track the amount of tea after

---------------

 each step, since the total volume remains constant (assuming he replaces 15% each time, so total volume stays same

---------------

).

Let me try step by step.

Let's denote the initial amount as 100 units (so 100 mL

---------------

 or whatever, it doesn't matter since we're dealing with percentages).

Initial concentration of tea: 50%, so tea

---------------

 is 50 units, milk is 50 units.

First replacement: he replaces 15% of the solution with milk.

So

---------------

 first, he removes 15% of the solution. That's 15 units. Since the solution is 50% tea, the 

---------------

15 units removed will have 7.5 tea and 7.5 milk.

After removing 15 units, the remaining tea is 50 -7.5 =42.5 units. The remaining milk is 50 -7.5=42.5 units.

---------------

 Then he adds back 15 units of milk. So milk becomes 42.5 +15 =57.5 units. Total

---------------

 volume is back to 100.

So after first replacement, the tea is 42.5 units. Concent

---------------

ration is 42.5%.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula here. The concentration after each replacement can be calculated as

---------------

 (previous concentration) * (1 - fraction replaced) + (concentration of added substance)*fraction replaced. Wait, but when

---------------

 you replace, you remove the mixture and add another substance. So for the tea concentration, when you remove 15%, the remaining

---------------

 tea is (1-0.15) times the previous concentration. Because the removed portion had the same concentration as before. Then adding

---------------

 milk (which has 0% tea) doesn't add any tea. So the new concentration is (previous concentration)*(1 - fraction removed).

Ah

---------------

, right! Because when you take out a portion, the remaining tea is (1 - fraction) * original concentration. Then you

---------------

 add the milk which has 0% tea. So the formula would be C_new = C_old * (1 - fraction

---------------

_replaced). Because the fraction_replaced is replaced with something that has 0% tea.

Wait, let's confirm with

---------------

 the first step. Original concentration is 50%. Replace 15% with milk (so replacing with 0% tea).

So

---------------

 C_new = 50% * (1 - 0.15) = 50% * 0.85 = 42.5%, which matches the manual

---------------

 calculation. So that's a better way.

So that formula seems correct. So each time he replaces a fraction f of the solution with milk (which

---------------

 is 0% tea), the new concentration is C * (1 - f).

So first step: 50% * (1 - 0.15) = 42.5% tea.

Then

---------------

 he does this again: replaces another 15% of the current solution with milk. So second step:

42.5% * (1 - 0.15) = 42.5 * 0.85 = let's compute that. 42.5 * 0.85.

---------------

 42.5 * 0.8 is 34, and 42.5 *0.05 is 2.125, so total 34 +2.125 = 36.125%. So after the second replacement, tea

---------------

 is 36.125%.

Then the third step: he replaces 10% of the current solution with milk. So that

---------------

's 36.125% * (1 - 0.10) = 36.125 *0.9 =

---------------

 ?

Calculating 36.125 *0.9. Let's see, 36 *0.9 is 32.4, and 0.125 *0.9 is 0.1125. So total 32.4 +0.1125 =32.5125%. Hmm

---------------

, that would be approximately 32.51%, which is option E. Wait, but let me check the options

---------------

 again.

Wait the options are A)15.38%, B)42%, C)39.86%, D)22.35%, E)32.51%. So 

---------------

32.51 is option E. But wait, let me make sure I did the steps correctly.

Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation in

---------------

 the steps.

Wait let me recalculate the second step again. 42.5 * 0.85.

---------------

 Let me compute that again. 42.5 *0.85. 40*0.85 is 34, 2.5 *0.85 is 2.125. So

---------------

 total is 34+2.125 = 36.125. That's correct.

Third step: 36.125 *0.9 = ?



---------------

36 *0.9 is 32.4, 0.125*0.9 is 0.1125, so total

---------------

 is 32.5125. So 32.51% which is option E. But wait

---------------

, the options have E as 32.51, which matches.

Hmm, but the answer might be different. Let me check

---------------

 if I misapplied the steps.

Wait, the problem says he replaces 15% of it with milk twice. So

---------------

 first time 15%, then again 15% of the new solution. So that part I did correctly. Then the

---------------

 third step is replacing 10% of the resultant solution with milk. So that's correct.

Wait, but maybe the

---------------

 question is phrased differently. Let me re-read the problem again.

"John likes to have lightly flavored tea every evening. In a 50% strong milk tea, he replaces 15% of it with milk twice. Then, he replaces 10 percent of the resultant solution with more milk. What is the final concentration of tea John drinks?"

Yes

---------------

, so first two replacements are 15% each, then another 10% replacement. So the steps are correct as

---------------

 I did.

Hmm. So according to that calculation, the answer would be E)32.51%.

Wait, but let

---------------

 me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the initial mixture is 50% tea and 50% milk, so when

---------------

 he replaces 15%, each time, but maybe I should do the math step by step again.

Alternatively, perhaps using

---------------

 a different approach.

Let me track the amount of tea after each step.

Starting with 100 units:

Initial tea: 50 units.

First replacement: remove

---------------

 15% of solution (15 units). The tea removed is 15*(50/100) = 7.5 units. So remaining tea is 50-7.5=42.5. Then adding

---------------

 15 units of milk (which has 0 tea), so total tea is still 42.5. So

---------------

 concentration 42.5%.

Second replacement: again, remove 15% of 100 units (1

---------------

5 units). Now, the concentration is 42.5%, so tea in the 15 units removed is 15 *0.425 =6.375 units. So

---------------

 remaining tea is 42.5 -6.375 =36.125. Then add 15 units milk,

---------------

 so total tea is 36.125. Concentration is 36.125%.

Third step: replace

---------------

 10% of the solution (10 units). The current concentration is 36.125%, so tea in the 10 units removed is 10 *0.36125 =3.6125 units. Remaining tea is 36.125 -3.6125 =32.5125. Adding 10 units milk,

---------------

 so total tea is 32.5125 units. The concentration is 32.5125%,

---------------

 which rounds to 32.51%, so option E.

Hmm, so that's the same result. So the

---------------

 answer must be E?

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 39.86% and D

---------------

 is 22.35%. Maybe I made a mistake in the steps?

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the problem

---------------

. Let me check again.

Wait the problem says "replaces 15% of it with milk twice". So that

---------------

's two times replacing 15% each time. Then replaces 10% once. So my calculation is correct.

Alternatively

---------------

, maybe the initial concentration is different. Wait the problem says "50% strong milk tea". Maybe that means the tea is 50% of the milk

---------------

 and tea? Or is the strength referring to the tea's concentration?

Typically, when something is described as "X% strong"

---------------

 in a mixture, it refers to the concentration of the main component. So "50% strong milk tea" would mean 

---------------

50% tea and 50% milk. That's how I interpreted it. So that's correct.

Hmm. Then

---------------

 the calculation leads to E)32.51%, which is option E. But let me check the options again to

---------------

 ensure I didn't misread the letters. The options are A:15.38, B:42, C:39.86, D:22.35, E:32.51.

Wait

---------------

, but another thought: maybe when replacing 15% of the solution, the first time, then the second time,

---------------

 the 15% is of the original solution's volume, not the current? But that would be a different approach. But

---------------

 the problem says "replaces 15% of it with milk twice". The "it" here refers to the current solution each time. So each time,

---------------

 it's 15% of the current volume, so the volume remains same each time.

Hmm, so my calculation is

---------------

 correct. So the answer should be E. But let me see if someone else might have a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 using the formula for successive dilution. The formula for concentration after n replacements is C = C0 * (1 - r)^n, but here

---------------

 the replacements are of different percentages. Wait, in this case, first two steps have 15% each, then 10%.

---------------

 So total would be C = 50% * (1-0.15)^2 * (1-0.10).

---------------

 Let's compute that.

50 * (0.85)^2 *0.9 = 50 * 0.7225 *0.9.



---------------

First 0.85 squared is 0.7225. Then multiply by 0.9: 0.7225 *0.9 = 0.65025. Then 50 *0.65025 =

---------------

 32.5125. Exactly the same as before. So that's correct.

Therefore, the answer should

---------------

 be E.


The problem involves determining the final concentration of tea after a series of replacements with milk. Starting with a 50% tea concentration, John replaces 15% of the solution with milk twice, followed by replacing 10% of the resultant solution with milk. 

**Step-by-Step Calculation:**

1. **Initial Concentration:** 50% tea (assuming

---------------

 100 units total).
2. **First Replacement (15%):**
   - Tea concentration after removal: \( 50\% \times (1 - 0.15) = 50\% \times 0.85 = 42.5\% \).
3. **Second Replacement (15%):**
   - Tea concentration after removal: \( 42.5\% \times 0.85 = 36.125\% \).
4. **Third Replacement (10%):**
   - Tea concentration after removal: \( 36.125\% \times 0.90 = 32.5125\% \).

The

---------------

 final concentration is approximately \( 32.51\% \), corresponding to option **E**.
