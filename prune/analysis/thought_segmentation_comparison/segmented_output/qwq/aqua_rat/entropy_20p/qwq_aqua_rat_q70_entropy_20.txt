Okay, let's see. The problem is about a shopkeeper who gave a 20% discount one day and now wants to raise

---------------

 the price back to the original. The question is asking by what percentage he needs to increase the discounted price to get back to the original. Hmm, percentages

---------------

 can be tricky sometimes because the base changes.

Alright, let me think step by step. Let's assume the original price of an item is, say, $100. That might

---------------

 make the math easier. So if the original price is $100 and there's a 20% discount, then the discounted price would be 100 minus 20% of 100. 

---------------

20% of 100 is 20, so the discounted price is $80. 

Now, the next day, he wants to sell it at the original price again. So he has to go from $80 back up to $100. The question is, what's the percentage increase needed on the discounted price ($80) to get back to $100?



---------------

To find the percentage increase, the formula is: ((New Price - Original Discounted Price) / Original Discounted Price) * 100. 

So here

---------------

, the increase needed is $20 (because 100 - 80 = 20). Plugging into the formula: (20 / 80) * 100. Let me calculate that. 20 divided by 80 is 0.25. Multiply by 100 gives 25%. So the required percentage increase is 25%.

---------------

 

Wait a second, so the answer should be option C, which is 25%? Let me double-check.

---------------

 If you take 25% of 80, that's 20, so adding that to 80 gives exactly 100. Yep, that works

---------------

. 

Alternatively, maybe some might think it's 20% because the discount was 20%, but that's a common mistake. Because the base changes

---------------

 here. The discount was 20% off the original, but the increase is off the discounted price. So the percentage isn

---------------

't the same. Like, for example, if you decrease by 50% and then increase by 50%, you don't get back to the original. So

---------------

 in this case, the increase has to be higher than 20% because the base is lower. 

Another way to think algebra

---------------

ically: Let the original price be P. After 20% discount, the new price is 0.8P. Let the required percentage increase be x%. So, 0.8P * (1 + x/100) = P. Solving for x: (1 + x/100) = P/(0.8P) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So x/100 = 0.25 â†’ x=25. Yep, that confirms

---------------

 it again. So the correct answer is C, 25%.


The shopkeeper initially offers a 20% discount on the original price. Let the original price be \( P \). After a 20% discount, the discounted price becomes \( 0.8P \). To return to the original price \( P \), the required

---------------

 percentage increase \( x \) must satisfy:

\[
0.8P \times \left(1 + \frac{x}{100}\right) = P
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
1 + \frac{x}{100} = \frac{P}{0.8P} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25 \\
\frac{x}{100} = 0.25 \\
x = 25\%
\]

Thus, the shopkeeper must increase the discounted price by 25% to restore

---------------

 the original price. The correct answer is **C)25%**.
