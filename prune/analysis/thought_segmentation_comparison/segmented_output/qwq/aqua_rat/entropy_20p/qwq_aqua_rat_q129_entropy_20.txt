Okay, so the question is about finding out what percentage the astronaut's weight on Venus is compared to their Earth weight. Let me think. The numbers given are 211 pounds on Earth and 182 on Venus. Hmm, percentage

---------------

-wise, right?

Alright, percentage calculation. The formula I remember is (part/whole) * 100. Here, the "part" would be the Venus weight, and the "whole" is the Earth weight. So I need to divide 182 by 211 and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage. 

Let me do the division first. 182 divided by 211. Let me see, maybe approximate?

---------------

 Let's see, 211 times 0.8 is 168.8, because 200*0.8 is 160 and 11*0.8 is 8.8, so total 168.8. But 182 is higher than that. Hmm

---------------

, maybe 0.86? Let me check 211 * 0.86. 200*0.86 is 172, and 11*0.86 is 

---------------

9.46. Adding those gives 172+9.46=181.46. Oh, that's really close to 182. So 0.86 would give approximately

---------------

 181.46, which is almost 182. So that's about 86%. 

Looking at the options, D is 86%, so that must be the answer. Let me double

---------------

-check my math. Alternatively, maybe I can do the division more precisely. 182 divided by 211. Let me write

---------------

 that out. 182 รท 211. Since 211 goes into 182 zero times, add a decimal. 211 into 1820. Let's see, 211*8 is 1688. Subtract that from 1820: 1820 - 1688 = 132. Bring down a zero, making 1320. 211*6 is 1266. Subtract from

---------------

 1320 gives 54. Bring down another zero to make 540. 211*2 is 422, subtract gives

---------------

 118. Hmm, so so far, the division gives 0.86... which matches the earlier calculation

---------------

. So 0.86 times 100 is 86%, so D is correct. The options given

---------------

 include D)86%, so that's the right choice.


To determine the percentage of the astronaut's weight on Venus relative to Earth, use the formula:  
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Weight on Venus}}{\text{Weight on Earth}} \right) \times 100
\]  
Plugging in the values:  
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{182}{211} \right) \times 100 \approx 86\%  
\]  
This calculation shows

---------------

 that the astronaut's weight on Venus is approximately **86%** of their Earth weight.
