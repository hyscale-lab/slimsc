Okay, so I have this question here about simple interest. Let me see... Rahul borrowed 500 rupees at 6% per annum, and we

---------------

 need to find out how much he has to pay after 4 years. Hmm, right, simple interest formula is I = P * R * T, right? Then the total amount would be principal plus interest.

Wait, let me make

---------------

 sure. The formula for simple interest is indeed Principal multiplied by rate multiplied by time. Then the total amount to pay back is the principal plus that interest. So first, I

---------------

 need to calculate the interest over 4 years.

The principal here is 500. The rate is 6% per year. So 6% as a decimal is 0.06. Time is 4 years. So pl

---------------

ugging into the formula: I = 500 * 0.06 * 4. Let me compute that.



---------------

First, 500 multiplied by 0.06. Let's see, 500 * 0.06 is 30. Because 1% of 500 is 5, so 6% is 30. Then multiply that by 4 years. 30 *4 is 120. So the interest is 120 rupees. Therefore

---------------

, the total amount to pay back is 500 + 120 = 620. 

Looking at the options: option C is 620. So the answer should be C,

---------------

 right? Wait, let me check the options again. The options are A)750, B)700, C)620, D)600, E)None. So

---------------

 yes, C is there. So the correct answer would be C)620. But wait, maybe I made a mistake somewhere

---------------

. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 6% of 500 each year. 6% of 500 is indeed 30 per year. Over four years, that's 30 *4 = 120. So

---------------

 total is 620. Yeah, that's correct. So the answer should be option C. But hold on, sometimes

---------------

 there might be a trick. Like, does the question say "clear the debt" which includes principal and interest? Yes, so the

---------------

 total amount is correct. I think that's right. So the answer is C.


To determine the total amount Rahul will pay after 4 years, we use the simple interest formula:  
**Interest (I) = Principal (P) × Rate (R) × Time (T)**.  

Given:  
- **Principal (P)** = Rs. 500  
- **Rate (R)** = 6% per annum = 0.06 (in decimal)  
- **Time (T)** = 4 years  

Calculating the interest:  
\  
I = 500 × 0.06 × 4 = 500 × 0.24 = 120  


---------------

\  

Total amount to clear the debt = **Principal + Interest** = 500 + 120 = **Rs. 620**.  

The options provided include **C) 620**, which matches the calculated result.  

Answer: C)620  

**Answer: C**  
Wait

---------------

, the options are listed as:  
A)750  
B)700  
C)620  
D)600  
E)None of these  

Since

---------------

 the calculation confirms the total is exactly 620, the correct answer is **C**.  

Answer: C<|im_end|>
