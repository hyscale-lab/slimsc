Okay, so I need to figure out how far I can go with $8.50 in this cab. Let's see, the problem says the cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and then 10 cents for each additional quarter mile. Hmm. Alright, let me break this down step by step.

First, the initial charge is $3.50 for the first quarter mile. A quarter mile is 0.25 miles. So the first 0.25 miles are covered by that initial fee. Then, after that, each additional quarter mile costs 10 cents. 

---------------

Wait, so the question is asking for the maximum distance with $8.50. So I have to subtract the initial cost from the total money and then see how many additional quarter-miles I can get with the remaining money.

Let me write down the steps:

Total money = $8.50

Subtract the initial $3.50: 8.50 - 3.50 = $5.00 left for the additional miles.

Now, each additional quarter-mile costs $0.10. So how many of those can I get with $5.00?

Number of additional quarter-miles = 5.00 / 0.10 = 50. Because 5 divided by 0.1 is 50. So 50 quarter-miles.



---------------

Wait, each quarter-mile is 0.25 miles. So the additional distance is 50 * 0.25 miles. Let me calculate that: 50 * 0.25 is 12.5 miles. 

Then add the initial quarter mile: 12.5 + 0.25 = 12.75 miles total.

Hmm, so looking at the options, option B is 12.75. So that should be the answer?



---------------

Wait, let me check my math again to be sure. Let me verify each step.

Total money: 8.50. Subtract 3.50 gives exactly 5.00. Correct.

Each additional quarter mile is 10 cents. So 10 cents per 0.25 miles. So 5 dollars divided by 0.10 dollars per quarter mile: 5 /0.1 is indeed 50. So 50 quarters. 50 *0.25 is 12.5. Then adding the first 0.25 gives 12.75. Yeah, that seems right.

Looking at the options, B is 12.75. So that's the answer. Let me check the other options to see if any could be a trap. Like maybe someone might forget to add the first quarter mile? Let's see, if someone only calculated the 12.5, then they might pick 12.5 which isn't an option. The closest is 12.75. 

---------------

Alternatively, maybe someone miscalculates the division. Let me see another approach.

Alternatively, maybe I should model it as an equation. Let me try that way.

Let total distance be D miles.

The first 0.25 miles cost $3.50. Any distance beyond that is charged per 0.25 miles. So, the additional distance beyond the first quarter mile is (D - 0.25) miles. But since the charge is per quarter mile, we have to express that in terms of how many quarter-miles that is.

Each quarter mile is 0.25 miles, so the number of additional quarter-miles is (D - 0.25)/0.25. 

So the total cost is 3.50 + 0.10 * [(D -0.25)/0.25] 

This should equal 8.50.

Let me write the equation:

3.50 + 0.10 * [(D - 0.25)/0.25] = 8.50

Subtract 3.50 from both sides:

0.10 * [(D -0.25)/0.25] = 5.00

Divide both sides by 0.10:

[(D -0.25)/0.25] = 50

Multiply both sides by 0.25:

D - 0.25 = 50 *0.25 =12.5

Add 0.25 to both sides:

D = 12.5 +0.25 =12.75. So that's exactly the same as before. So the equation approach also gives B as the correct answer. 

Therefore, I think the answer is B)12.75 miles.


To determine the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 in the cab, start by subtracting the initial charge of $3.50 for the first quarter-mile (0.25 miles). This leaves $5.00. Each additional quarter-mile costs $0.10, so the number of additional quarter-miles you can afford is $5.00 / $0.10 = 50. Each quarter-mile is 0.25 miles, so 50 quarter-miles equal 50 * 0.25 = 12.5 miles. Adding the initial 0.25 miles gives a total distance of 12.5 + 0.25 = 12.75 miles. 

The equation approach confirms this:  
Total cost = $3.50 + $0.10 * [(D - 0.25)/0.25] = $8.50.  
Solving for D yields D = 12.75 miles.  

Answer: B)12.75 miles.
