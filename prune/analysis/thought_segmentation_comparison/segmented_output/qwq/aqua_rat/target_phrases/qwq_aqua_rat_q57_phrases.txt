Okay, let's see. The problem is about percentages of chocolates being cocoa or vanilla flavored and whether they're squashed. Hmm. Alright, so first, all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa. So that's two categories. The first piece of information is that 10% are cocoa flavored. That means 90% must be vanilla, right?

Then the next part says 90% of the rest are squashed. 

---------------

Wait, "the rest" here refers to what? Let me parse that again. The question is asking for the percentage that's both vanilla and not squashed.

So let me break it down step by step. Let's assume there are 100 chocolates in total to make percentages easier. 

First, 10% are cocoa, so that's 10 chocolates. The remaining 90 must be vanilla. Now, the next part: 90% of the rest are squashed. 

---------------

Wait, "the rest" probably refers to the remaining after the cocoa ones. So the rest would be the 90 vanilla chocolates. So 90% of those 90 are squashed. Let me calculate that. 90% of 90 is 81. So 81 of the vanilla are squashed. That means the number of vanilla not squashed would be 90 total vanilla minus 81 squashed, which is 9. So 9 out of 100 total chocolates are vanilla and not squashed. So that's 9%, which is option D. 



---------------

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me make sure I didn't misinterpret "the rest". The problem says "90% of the rest are squashed". The first part took away 10% cocoa, so the rest is 90% of the total. So yes, that rest is the 90% (vanilla), so 90% of that 90% is 0.9 * 90% = 81% squashed. So the vanilla not squashed would be 90% - 81% = 9%. So the answer should be D)9%. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the interpretation. Let me try another way. Suppose "the rest" after cocoa is 90%, and 90% of all chocolates (the total) are squashed? No, that doesn't fit the wording. The wording says "90% of the rest are squashed". So the rest refers to the remaining 90% (non-cocoa), so yes, 90% of that 90% is squashed. Therefore, the vanilla not squashed is 10% of the 90% (since 90% are squashed, so 10% not squashed of the vanilla). 10% of 90 is 9. So that's correct. So answer D.


To solve the problem, start by considering a total of 100 chocolates for simplicity. 

1. **Cocoa-flavored chocolates**: 10% of 100 = 10 chocolates.  
2. **Vanilla-flavored chocolates**: The remaining 90% = 90 chocolates.  

Next, the problem states that **90% of the rest (the vanilla-flavored chocolates)** are squashed:  
3. **Squashed vanilla chocolates**: 90% of 90 = 81 chocolates.  
4. **Non-squashed vanilla chocolates**: Total vanilla (90) âˆ’ Squashed vanilla (81) = 9 chocolates.  

Thus, **9% of the total chocolates** are both vanilla-flavored and not squashed.  

Answer: D)9%
