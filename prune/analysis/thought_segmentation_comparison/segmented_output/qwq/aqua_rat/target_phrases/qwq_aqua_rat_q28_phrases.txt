Okay, so I have this problem here about a jeep's journey. Let me read it again carefully. The jeep goes somewhere and takes 6 hours going there. Then on the way back, it goes faster by 12 km/h and takes 4 hours. They want to know the distance traveled. Hmm, right.



---------------

Wait, the distance for the forward and return journeys should be the same, right? Because it's going and coming back. So the distance each way is the same. That's probably key here.

Let me think of variables. Let's say the speed during the forward journey is 'v' km/h. Then the return speed would be v + 12 km/h. The time taken forward is 6 hours, so the distance is speed multiplied by time. So forward distance is 6v. 

On the return trip, the time is 4 hours, so the return distance would be (v +12) *4. Since both distances are the same, I can set them equal. 

So equation: 6v = 4(v +12). Let me write that down. 

Expanding the right side: 6v =4v +48. Subtract 4v from both sides: 2v =48. Then v =24 km/h. 

So the forward speed is 24 km/h, so the distance is 6 *24. Let me calculate that. 6 times 20 is 120, plus 6 times4 is 24, so total 144. So the distance one way is 144 km. The total distance traveled would be twice that, but wait the question says "distance travelled by the jeep"—does that mean the total round trip or just one way? 

---------------

Wait, the options have 144 as an option (B), and 228 which is 144*1.58... Hmm, maybe I need to check the question again. 



---------------

Wait the question says "What is the distance travelled by the jeep?" So the total journey would be going and coming back. So total distance would be 144 *2 = 288? 

---------------

Wait but none of the options have that. Wait hold on. Wait the options given are A)126, B)144, C)127, D)228, E)128. Hmm, so 144 is there. 

---------------

Wait maybe the question is asking for one way? Because the problem says "distance travelled by the jeep"—maybe the question is referring to one way? 

---------------

Wait, but the problem states "the distance" in the forward journey, but the question is phrased as "distance travelled by the jeep"—so the entire trip? That's ambiguous. 

---------------

Wait, let me check the question again.

Original question: "What is the distance travelled by the jeep?" The journey includes both going and returning. So total distance would be twice the one-way. 

---------------

Wait, but according to my calculation, the one-way is 144, so total is 288. But that's not an option. 

---------------

Wait, so maybe I made a mistake?

Hmm, let me go through the steps again. Let me recheck the equations. Let me set variables again.

Let me denote the distance one way as D. So in the forward journey, time is 6 hours, so D = v *6. Return journey, D = (v +12)*4. So since both equal D, set equal: 6v =4(v+12). Solving:

6v =4v +48 → 2v=48 →v=24. So then D=6*24=144. So that's the one-way distance. But the question says "distance travelled"—if it's the total trip, then it's 144*2=288. But that's not an option. The options given don't have 288. 

---------------

Wait, the options given include D)228. Hmm, so maybe I made a miscalculation here. Let me check the problem again.



---------------

Wait the problem says "increased its speed by 12 km/h and took 4 hours". So maybe the return journey's time is 4 hours, so the return speed is higher, so the time is less, which makes sense. So my equations are correct. So then the answer must be 144, which is option B. Because perhaps the question is asking for one way? Maybe the wording is ambiguous. Let me read the question again.

The question says "the distance travelled by the jeep". Since the jeep made a journey there and back, the total distance would be twice the one-way. But maybe the question is asking for the one-way distance. Because the options have 144, but not 288. So perhaps the question is considering the one-way trip as the distance. 

---------------

Wait, the wording is a bit unclear, but in many such problems, when they say "distance travelled" in the context of a round trip, sometimes they might just ask for one way. 

---------------

Wait the problem says "a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey". The wording "certain distance" probably refers to the one-way distance. The question is then asking for that same distance. So the answer is 144, which is B. So I think B is the correct answer. Let me check the options again. Option B is 144. So the answer must be B.


To solve the problem, let's denote the jeep's speed during the forward journey as \( v \) km/h. The distance for the forward journey is then \( 6v \) km (since it took 6 hours). On the return journey, the speed is increased by 12 km/h, making the return speed \( v + 12 \) km/h, and the time taken is 4 hours. Thus, the return distance is \( 4(v + 12) \) km. Since the distance for both journeys is the same, we set up the equation:

\[
6v = 4(v + 12)
\]

Solving for \( v \):

\[
6v = 4v + 48 \\
2v = 48 \\
v = 24 \text{ km/h}
\]

The one-way distance is \( 6v = 6 \times 24 = 144 \) km. The question asks for the "distance travelled by the jeep," which likely refers to the one-way distance since the problem mentions "a certain distance" in the context of the forward journey. The total round-trip distance (288 km) is not among the options, but 144 km (Option B) is. 

Answer: B
