Okay, so I need to solve this problem about the jeep's journey. Let's see. The question says that the jeep takes 6 hours going somewhere, and on the way back, it goes 12 km/h faster and takes 4 hours. They want to know the distance traveled. Hmm, right.

First, I remember that distance equals speed multiplied by time. So, the distance for the forward journey and the return journey should be the same, right? Because it's going to the same place and coming back. So the distance there and back is the same. That's important.

Let me denote the speed during the forward journey as 'v' km/h. Then, the return speed would be 'v + 12' km/h. The time taken for forward is 6 hours, so the distance is v * 6. For the return trip, the time is 4 hours, so the distance is (v + 12) * 4. Since both distances are the same, I can set them equal.

So the equation would be 6v = 4(v + 12). Let me write that down properly. 

6v = 4(v + 12). 

Now I can solve for v. Expanding the right side gives 4v + 48. Subtract 4v from both sides: 6v -4v =48 → 2v =48 → v=24 km/h. 

So the forward speed is 24 km/h. Then the distance is 24 *6 = 144 km.

Wait, but let me check the return trip. The return speed would be 24+12=36 km/h. 36 *4 is 144. Oh, that's the same. So the distance is 144 km. Looking at the options, B is 144. So the answer should be B?



---------------

Wait, let me double-check. Let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let's see:

Original speed v =24. 6 hours: 24*6 is indeed 144. Return speed is 36, 36*4 is 144. Yep, that's correct. So the answer is B)144km. That's one of the options. The other options: 126, 127, 228, 128. None of those match. So I think that's right.


To solve the problem, let the jeep's speed during the forward journey be \( v \) km/h. The distance for the forward journey is \( 6v \) km. On the return journey, the speed increases by 12 km/h, making the return speed \( v + 12 \) km/h, and the time taken is 4 hours. The return distance is \( 4(v + 12) \) km. Since both distances are equal:

\[
6v = 4(v + 12)
\]

Expanding and solving for \( v \):

\[
6v = 4v + 48 \implies 2v = 48 \implies v = 24 \text{ km/h}
\]

The distance traveled is then calculated using the forward journey:

\[
\text{Distance} = 6v = 6 \times 24 = 144 \text{ km}
\]

Verification with the return journey confirms the distance:

\[
\text{Return speed} = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ km/h} \implies 36 \times 4 = 144 \text{ km}
\]

Both calculations yield the same distance, confirming the solution is correct. The correct answer is **B)144km**.

Answer: B
