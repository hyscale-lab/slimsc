Okay, so I have this question here about simple interest. Let me see... Rahul borrowed 500 rupees at 6% per annum, and we need to find out how much he has to pay after 4 years. Hmm, right, simple interest formula is I = P * R * T, right? Then the total amount would be principal plus interest.

Wait, let me make sure. The formula for simple interest is indeed Principal multiplied by rate multiplied by time. Then the total amount to pay back is the principal plus that interest. So first, I need to calculate the interest over 4 years.

The principal here is 500. The rate is 6% per year. So 6% as a decimal is 0.06. Time is 4 years. So plugging into the formula: I = 500 * 0.06 * 4. Let me compute that.

First, 500 multiplied by 0.06. Let's see, 500 * 0.06 is 30. Because 1% of 500 is 5, so 6% is 30. Then multiply that by 4 years. 30 *4 is 120. So the interest is 120 rupees. Therefore, the total amount to pay back is 500 + 120 = 620. 

Looking at the options: option C is 620. So the answer should be C, right?

Wait, let me check the options again. The options are A)750, B)700, C)620, D)600, E)None. So yes, C is there. So the correct answer would be C)620.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 6% of 500 each year. 6% of 500 is indeed 30 per year. Over four years, that's 30 *4 = 120. So total is 620. Yeah, that's correct. So the answer should be option C. But hold on, sometimes there might be a trick. Like, does the question say "clear the debt" which includes principal and interest? Yes, so the total amount is correct. I think that's right. So the answer is C.


To determine the total amount Rahul will pay after 4 years, we use the simple interest formula:  
**Interest (I) = Principal (P) × Rate (R) × Time (T)**.  

Given:  
- **Principal (P)** = Rs. 500  
- **Rate (R)** = 6% per annum = 0.06 (in decimal)  
- **Time (T)** = 4 years  

Calculating the interest:  
\  
I = 500 × 0.06 × 4 = 500 × 0.24 = 120  
\  

Total amount to clear the debt = **Principal + Interest** = 500 + 120 = **Rs. 620**.  

The options provided include **C) 620**, which matches the calculated result.  

Answer: C)620  

**Answer: C**

Wait, the options are listed as:  
A)750  
B)700  
C)620  
D)600  
E)None of these  

Since the calculation confirms the total is exactly 620, the correct answer is **C**.  

Answer: C
