Okay, let's see. The problem is about converting marks from a maximum of M to 800, and figuring out what M is. Hmm, so the candidate got 504 out of M, and when they convert that to a scale where the max is 800, their score becomes 420. 

---------------

Wait, how does the conversion work here?

I think the idea is that the percentage of marks secured would remain the same when converted. Like, if you have 504/M, then when scaled to 800, that same percentage would be 420. Because otherwise, how else would the conversion work? Maybe it's a proportional problem.

So let's set up a proportion. The original score over the original maximum equals the new score over the new maximum. So 504/M = 420/800. Is that right? Because if the ratio is preserved, then that equation should hold.

Let me check. Suppose the student's percentage is (504/M)*100. When converted to 800, their marks would be (percentage/100)*800. Which would be (504/M)*8. So according to the problem, this equals 420. So 504/M *8 =420. 

---------------

Wait, that's another way of writing the same equation. Let me see.

Yes, so solving for M: 504 divided by M equals 420 divided by 800. Let me rearrange that equation. 

Cross-multiplying: 504 * 800 = 420 * M. 

So M = (504 * 800)/420. Let me calculate that. 

First, maybe simplify the numbers. Let's see, 504 divided by 420. Let me see if they have a common factor. Both numbers are divisible by 84? Let's check 420 divided by 84 is 5, and 504 divided by 84 is 6. Because 84*6 is 504. So 504/420 = 6/5. 



---------------

Wait, so substituting that in, M = (6/5 * 800) ?

Wait, because (504 /420) is 6/5, so the equation would be (504/420)*800 = M?



---------------

Wait, maybe I should just compute 504*800 first. Let's do that step by step. 

504 multiplied by 800. 504*8 is 4032, so times 100 is 403,200. Then divide by 420. 

So 403200 divided by 420. Let's see. 

Hmm, let's divide numerator and denominator by 10 to make it 40320 /42. 

Dividing 40320 by 42. Let's see. 42 times 960 is 40,320? Let's check 42*900=37,800. 42*60 is 2,520. Adding those gives 37,800 +2,520 =40,320. Oh right! So 42*960=40320. So that would make M=960. 



---------------

Wait, so M is 960? Looking at the options, E is 960. So the answer should be E?



---------------

Wait but let me double-check. Let me plug back in. If M is 960, then the original marks are 504/960. Let's compute that as a decimal. 504 divided by 960. Let's see, 504 ÷ 960. Well, 504/960 = 0.525. So 52.5%. 

If the maximum is converted to 800, then 52.5% of 800 is 0.525*800 = 420. Exactly what the problem states. So that works. 

So the correct answer is E) 960. Let me check the options again. The options are A)278, B)2890, C)270, D)2702, E)960. Yep, E is there. 



---------------

Wait, but why are there options like 270 or 2702? Maybe someone could miscalculate. Like maybe if they did 420/800 * M =504, which would be solving M as (504 *800)/420, which is exactly what I did. So that's correct. So I think I did it right. So the answer is E.


To solve the problem, we recognize that the candidate's score as a proportion of the maximum marks should remain consistent when scaled to a new maximum. The equation is set up as follows:

\[
\frac{504}{M} = \frac{420}{800}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
504 \times 800 = 420 \times M
\]

Solving for \( M \):

\[
M = \frac{504 \times 800}{420}
\]

Simplifying the numerator and denominator by dividing both 504 and 420 by their greatest common divisor (84):

\[
\frac{504}{420} = \frac{6}{5}
\]

Thus:

\[
M = \frac{6}{5} \times 800 = 960
\]

Verification: If \( M = 960 \), the candidate's percentage is \( \frac{504}{960} = 0.525 \). When scaled to 800, this gives \( 0.525 \times 800 = 420 \), which matches the problem's conditions. The correct answer is **E) 960**.
