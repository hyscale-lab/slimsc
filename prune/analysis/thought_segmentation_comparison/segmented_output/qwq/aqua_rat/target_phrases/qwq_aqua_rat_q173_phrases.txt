Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the percentage increase in the average cost per year between buying new tires versus repairing the current ones. Hmm, the problem says the new tires last four years and cost $180 each. The repair option is $40 per tire and extends the current tires by one year. 

---------------

Wait, so the customer can either buy new tires now, which will last four years, or repair their current ones each year? Or is the repair a one-time thing?



---------------

Wait, the question says "can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year." So each repair gives an extra year. So if the customer wants to keep using their current tires beyond their original lifespan, they can pay $40 each time for a year's extension. But how many repairs would they need to match the four-year lifespan of the new tires? Because the current tires, when purchased new, also last four years? 

---------------

Wait no, the problem says "when purchased new, last for four years." So the current tires are already being used, maybe? Or maybe the customer is comparing buying new vs repairing the current ones. 

---------------

Wait the problem might be that the customer is considering whether to buy new tires now or repair the existing ones. Let me read the question again.

The question is asking: The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?



---------------

Wait, maybe I need to clarify the scenarios. Let me parse it again.

The customer can choose between two options:

1. Buy new tires at $180 per tire. These new tires last four years.

2. Repair current tires at $40 per tire. Each repair extends their life by one year. So, to have the same four-year lifespan as the new tires, how many repairs would be needed?



---------------

Wait, the current tires must already be in use. Let's assume that the customer's current tires have already been used for some time. 

---------------

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the current tires are already at the end of their four-year lifespan? Or maybe the customer is deciding between buying new now (which would last four years) versus repairing their current tires each year for four years? Or maybe the current tires have some remaining lifespan?



---------------

Wait, the problem might be that the current tires, when new, last four years, so if they are currently at the end of their lifespan, then the customer can choose to buy new ones or repair the old ones. But each repair gives one more year. So to get four years from the current tires, they would need four repairs? Because each repair adds a year. So, for four years, they need four repairs. Each repair costs $40. So the total cost over four years would be 4 * $40 = $160. Then, the average cost per year for repairs would be $160 / 4 = $40 per year.

On the other hand, buying new tires is a one-time cost of $180, which gives four years. So average cost per year is $180 /4 = $45 per year.



---------------

Wait, so the question is asking by what percentage is the new tire's average cost higher than the repair's average cost. 

Let me compute the difference. The new tires average $45 per year, repairs average $40. The difference is $5. So the percentage increase from $40 to $45 would be (5/40)*100 = 12.5%. That would be option C.



---------------

Wait, but let me check again. Let me go through step by step.

First, new tires cost $180 and last four years. So average cost per year is 180 divided by 4. 180/4 is 45. So that's correct.

For the repair option: each repair gives one additional year. The problem says the customer can choose to repair the current tires. But how many repairs are needed to get the same total lifespan as the new tires?



---------------

Wait, the problem says the current tires when new last four years. So if the customer is choosing between buying new (which gives four years from now) or repairing the current ones. But if the current tires have already been used for some time, perhaps they have some remaining life. 

---------------

Wait, the problem might not specify that. Maybe the problem assumes that the current tires are at the end of their lifespan. Because otherwise, if they have some remaining life, the problem would need to state how much. Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the current tires are at the end of their four-year lifespan. So they can't be used anymore unless repaired. So to get four years of use from the current tires, they need to repair them four times, each time adding a year. So each repair is $40, so total cost for four years would be 4*40 = $160. So average cost per year is 160/4 = 40. 

So comparing the two averages: new is $45/year, repair is $40/year. The question is, the new's average is what percent greater than repair's. So the formula is (45-40)/40 *100 = (5/40)*100 = 12.5%. So the answer would be C, 12.5%.



---------------

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check if the repairs are only needed three times? Let's see: Suppose the current tires are already at the end of their original four years. So without any repairs, they can't be used. To get four more years, you need four repairs. Each repair gives one year. So first repair gives one year, second another, etc. So four repairs for four years. So yes, 4 times 40.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the current tires have one year left and the customer is considering whether to repair them for another year or buy new. But the problem states that when purchased new, they last four years. The question is probably considering the same four-year period. So the new tires will last four years, while the repaired ones would need four repairs to get four years. 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is comparing the cost over four years. Let me see:

New tires: one-time cost of $180, giving four years. So total cost is 180, average per year 45.

Repairing: to have the tires last four years, you need four repairs, each at 40, so total 160, average 40.

Difference is 5. 5/40 is 0.125, which is 12.5%, so C is correct.

Hmm, so the answer should be C. Let me check the options again. The options are A)8%, B)10%, C)12.5%, D)16.7%, E)25%. So C is there. 



---------------

Wait, but wait another angle. Maybe the current tires can be repaired each year, so for each year, you pay $40. So over four years, you pay 40 each year, so average cost is 40 per year. The new tires are 180 over four years, so 45 per year. So the difference is 5. So (45-40)/40 = 12.5% increase. So yes, that's correct.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the customer can choose between buying new now (which would last four years) or repairing the current tires once, which would give one more year. But that would only be a one-year comparison, which doesn't make sense. The question must be comparing the same time period. Since the new tires last four years, the repair option must be extended to four years as well, so requiring four repairs. 

Therefore, I think the correct answer is C, 12.5%.


To determine the percentage increase in the average annual cost between new tires and repairing current tires, we first calculate the average costs for both options:

1. **New Tires**:  
   - Cost: $180 per tire  
   - Lifespan: 4 years  
   - Average cost per year:  
     \[
     \frac{180}{4} = 45 \text{ dollars/year}
     \]

2. **Repairing Current Tires**:  
   - Each repair costs $40 and extends lifespan by 1 year.  
   - To match the 4-year lifespan of new tires, 4 repairs are needed.  
   - Total cost over 4 years:  
     \[
     4 \times 40 = 160 \text{ dollars}
     \]  
   - Average cost per year:  
     \[
     \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars/year}
     \]

Next, we calculate the percentage increase from the repair cost to the new tire cost:  
\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{45 - 40}{40} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{5}{40} \right) \times 100 = 12.5\%
\]

Thus, the average cost of new tires is **12.5% greater** than the cost of repairing the current tires.
