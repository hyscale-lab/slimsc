Okay, let's see. The problem is about distributing ten lime soda bottles into two groups of five each for two different customer groups. Hmm, I need to figure out how many ways this can be done. 



---------------

Wait, so there are ten bottles, and each group has five members. But does each member get one bottle? The question says "served among two different groups of customers consisting of 5 members each." So maybe each member gets a bottle? Or are the groups getting the bottles collectively? The wording is a bit ambiguous. 

---------------

Wait, maybe it's about dividing the bottles between the two groups. The problem states "create these 2 groups" so perhaps the groups are being formed by assigning the bottles to each group. 

Oh right, the question is about partitioning the ten bottles into two groups of five each. But since the groups are different (maybe they are distinct groups, like group A and group B?), so the order might matter? 

---------------

Wait, the problem says "two different groups of customers". So if the groups are distinguishable (like group 1 and group 2), then the number would be different than if they aren't. 



---------------

Wait, the question says "how many ways to create these 2 groups". Hmm. Let me think. Let's suppose the groups are indistinct. 

---------------

Wait, but they are different groups. Like, maybe they are two tables, so the order matters. Or maybe not. Hmm. Let's think of the standard approach for splitting into groups. 

The standard formula for dividing 2n items into two groups of n each is (2n choose n)/2 if the groups are indistinct. But if they are distinct, then it's (2n choose n). Because choosing group A and then group B is the same as choosing group B then group A when they are indistinct, but different when they are distinct. 

In this case, the problem states "two different groups", so probably they are considered distinct. 

---------------

Wait, "different" might just mean they are separate groups, but maybe the groups themselves are not labeled. Hmm, the wording is a bit unclear here. Let me read the problem again: "how many ways to create these 2 groups". So perhaps the groups are considered different because they are for different customers. So maybe the order does matter. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the problem is just about partitioning the ten bottles into two groups of five, and since the groups are for different customers, each grouping is unique based on which group is which. 

So if the groups are labeled (like group 1 and group 2), then the number is 10 choose 5, which is 252. But if they are unlabeled, then divide by 2, which would be 126. 

Looking at the options, 252 and 126 are both there (options D and C). The problem says the groups are "different", so I think the groups are considered distinct. So then the answer would be 252. 

---------------

But wait, let me check again. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the customers are in groups of five each. 

---------------

Wait, the question says "served among two different groups of customers consisting of 5 members each." So each group has five customers. So each customer probably gets one bottle. So the problem is distributing the ten bottles to the ten customers, but the customers are divided into two groups of five. 

---------------

Wait, maybe the question is about dividing the ten customers into two groups of five, but the bottles are all being given out? 

---------------

Wait, no, the question says "there are ten lime soda bottles on a table... they are to be served among two different groups of customers consisting of 5 members each." 

Hmm, maybe each group has five customers, so each customer gets a bottle. So each group gets five bottles. So the problem is dividing the ten bottles into two groups of five each, and the groups are for different customer groups. Since the groups are different (different tables or different orders?), then the order matters. 

Therefore, the number of ways is 10 choose 5. Which is 252. That's option D. 

---------------

But wait, another thought: sometimes when you split into groups, even if they're different, if the order within the groups doesn't matter, then 10C5 is correct. Because choosing which 5 go to group A and the rest to group B. 



---------------

Alternatively, if the groups are considered the same, then divide by 2. But the problem says the groups are different, so no division. So 252 would be the answer. 

---------------

But wait, looking at the options again: the options include 126 (C) and 252 (D). 



---------------

Wait, but another angle: perhaps the problem is about partitioning the ten bottles into two groups of five, where the order of the groups doesn't matter. But the question says "two different groups", so maybe the groups are distinguishable. Let's think of an example. Suppose group A is the first table and group B the second. Then the number would be 10C5 = 252. But if the groups are not labeled (like just dividing into any two groups), then it's 10C5/2 = 126. Since the problem says "two different groups", perhaps implying they are distinguishable. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about assigning each bottle to one of the two groups, with each group getting exactly five. The number of ways is 10!/(5!5!) = 252. So that would be D. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the customers are already in groups, and we are assigning the bottles to each group. Since the groups are different, the answer is 252. 

Hmm, but wait the options also have 105 (B). Where does that come from? 10 choose 5 divided by 2 is 126, but maybe another approach. 

---------------

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the groups as unordered. Let me think again. 

Wait, perhaps the question is about dividing the customers into two groups, but the customers are already there. 

---------------

Wait, no, the problem states the bottles are to be served among the two groups. The groups have five members each, so each group must receive five bottles. So the problem is the number of ways to split the ten bottles into two groups of five. Since the groups are different, the answer is 10C5 =252. 

So the options given include D)252. So why is 126 an option? Maybe I'm missing something here. 

---------------

Wait, perhaps the groups are considered the same. Let me think again. 

Wait, the problem says "two different groups of customers". The word "different" might not imply that the groups are labeled. For example, two groups could be different in composition, but the division is considered the same if you swap them. But in that case, the problem would require dividing by two. 

Hmm. Let me think of a concrete example. Suppose the groups are two tables: Table 1 and Table 2. Then assigning 5 bottles to Table1 and 5 to Table2 is 252. But if the tables are indistinct (like just two groups, not labeled), then it's 126. The question says the groups are "different", so perhaps they are labeled. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the groups are different because their members are different. But the problem is about distributing the bottles to the groups, so the key is whether the groups are distinguishable. 

The problem states "two different groups of customers". The wording "different" could mean that the groups are distinct entities (like two different parties), so the assignment matters. 

Therefore, I think the correct answer is 252, which is D. But let me check the options again. The options are A)90, B)105, C)126, D)252, E)525. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the number of ways to split the customers into two groups of five, but the problem mentions the bottles. 

---------------

Wait, the problem is about the bottles being served to the groups. Each group has five members, so each member gets a bottle. So the total number of ways to distribute the bottles is the same as partitioning the 10 bottles into two groups of five. 

Therefore, the answer is 10 choose 5 divided by 2 if groups are indistinct, or 10 choose5 if they are distinct. 

The problem says the groups are different, so I think the answer is 252. So D. 



---------------

Wait, but maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. Let's see, if the groups are considered the same, like just dividing into any two groups, then the formula is 10C5 / 2 = 252/2 = 126. But if the groups are different (like group A and group B), then it's 252. Since the problem says "two different groups of customers", perhaps the groups are considered distinct, so 252 is the answer. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the customers being divided into groups, but that's a different approach. Wait, the problem says "there are ten lime soda bottles on a table... they are to be served among two different groups of customers consisting of 5 members each." 

Hmm, so each group has five customers, and each customer gets one bottle. So the total number of bottles is ten, so exactly one per customer. So the problem is equivalent to partitioning the ten bottles into two groups of five, and assigning each group to a customer group. Since the customer groups are different, the order matters. 

Therefore, the number of ways is 10 choose 5 = 252. So the answer is D. 



---------------

Wait, but let me check another angle. Suppose the customers are already divided into two groups. Then the problem is about distributing the bottles to each group. But the question is asking how many ways to create these two groups. 

---------------

Wait, perhaps the question is about forming the two groups of customers (each with five members) from a larger set? But the problem says "there are ten lime soda bottles" and the groups are already existing (consisting of 5 members each). 

---------------

Wait, the wording is a bit unclear. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the ten bottles are to be divided between two groups, each group getting five bottles. The groups are different, so the answer is 252. So the answer is D. 

Hmm, but why is option C)126 there? Let me think again. Maybe the problem is considering the order of the groups as not important. Let me see: if you have two groups, and the groups are considered the same (like just two groups without labels), then the number is 126. But the problem says "two different groups", so that suggests that they are considered distinct. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe "different" just means that the groups are not the same people, but the division into which group is which doesn't matter. 

Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Let me think of a standard combinatorics problem. 

The standard problem when splitting 2n items into two groups of n is: if the groups are indistinct, the number is (2n choose n)/2. If they are distinct, it's (2n choose n). 

The question here says the groups are "different". So I think that implies that the groups are distinct, so the answer is 10C5 = 252. 

Therefore, I think the correct answer is D.


To determine the number of ways to divide ten lime soda bottles into two groups of five each for two different customer groups, we consider whether the groups are distinguishable. Since the problem specifies "two different groups," we treat them as distinct (e.g., Group A and Group B). The number of ways to choose 5 bottles out of 10 for the first group is given by the binomial coefficient \( \binom{10}{5} \). The remaining 5 bottles automatically form the second group, so no further division is necessary. 

Calculating this, we have:
\[
\binom{10}{5} = \frac{10!}{5! \cdot 5!} = 252
\]
Thus, the correct answer is **D)252**, as the groups are considered distinct and no further adjustment is needed.

Answer: D
