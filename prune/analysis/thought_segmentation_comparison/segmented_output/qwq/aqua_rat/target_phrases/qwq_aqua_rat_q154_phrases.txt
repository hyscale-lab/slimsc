Okay, so here's this problem about a room's height and semi-perimeter ratio, and the cost to paper the walls. Hmm, I need to figure out the height. Let me start breaking it down step by step.

First, the problem states that the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. 

---------------

Wait, semi-perimeter? Oh right, semi-perimeter usually means half the perimeter. So for a room, which is a rectangular prism, the perimeter would be 2*(length + width). Therefore, the semi-perimeter would just be (length + width). So the ratio is height : (length + width) = 2:5. Let me note that down.

Let me denote the height as h. Then according to the ratio, h/(length + width) = 2/5. So h = (2/5)*(length + width). Maybe I can call the semi-perimeter S, so S = length + width. Then h = (2/5)S. That might come in handy later.

Now the next part: it costs Rs.260 to paper the walls with paper that's 50cm wide, priced at Rs.2 per meter. And they allow 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So the cost is based on the area of the walls minus the area for doors and windows. 



---------------

Wait, the total cost is calculated by the area of the walls (excluding doors/windows) multiplied by the cost per square meter? Or maybe the cost per meter of the paper? Hmm, need to think carefully.

The paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters. The cost is Rs.2 per meter. 

---------------

Wait, per meter of the paper? So each meter length of the paper (since it's 0.5m wide) would cost 2 Rs. So the cost per square meter of the paper would be (2 Rs/m) / (0.5 m width) = 4 Rs per square meter? 

---------------

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of how much area one meter of the paper covers. Since the width is 50 cm (0.5 m), each meter of the paper's length would cover 0.5 m². 



---------------

Wait, perhaps better to approach this step by step. Let me see.

The total cost is 260 Rs. The cost per meter of the paper (length) is Rs.2. Since the paper is 50 cm wide, each meter of the paper's length gives an area of 0.5 m * 1 m = 0.5 m². But the cost per meter (length) is 2 Rs. So the cost per square meter of the paper would be (2 Rs/m) divided by 0.5 m²/m (since each meter gives 0.5 m²). So 2 / 0.5 = 4 Rs per square meter. So the cost is 4 Rs per square meter of the paper used. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the total area first. Let me think again.

The total cost is (Area of walls - 15) * (cost per square meter). But the cost per square meter here is determined by the price of the paper. Since the paper is 50 cm wide (0.5 m), each meter of the paper's length provides 0.5 m² of area. The cost for each meter of paper (length) is Rs.2. Therefore, the cost per square meter of the paper is (2 Rs) / (0.5 m²) = 4 Rs/m². So yes, that's the same as before. 

Therefore, the cost equation would be:

Total cost = (Total wall area - 15) * 4 = 260.

So first, let me find the total wall area. The walls of a rectangular room have an area of 2*(length * height + width * height) = 2*height*(length + width). Since the perimeter (length + width)*2, so semi-perimeter is (length + width), so the area is height * semi-perimeter. 



---------------

Wait, because 2*(length*height + width*height) = 2*height*(length + width) = height * 2*(length + width) = height * perimeter. 

---------------

Wait, no. Wait, perimeter is 2*(length + width), so semi-perimeter is (length + width). So the area of the four walls is 2*(l*h + w*h) = 2h*(l + w) = h * 2(l + w) = h * perimeter. Hmm, so the total wall area is height multiplied by the perimeter. 

---------------

Wait, but perimeter is 2*(l + w), so total area would be h*(2(l + w)), but that's the same as 2h*(l +w). 



---------------

Alternatively, since the semi-perimeter is (l +w), so the area would be 2h*(semi-perimeter). 

---------------

Wait, no, 2h*(l +w) is the same as h multiplied by 2*(l +w), which is the perimeter. So the area of the walls is perimeter multiplied by height. 

So, the total wall area is h * perimeter. But since perimeter is 2*(l +w), so the area is h*2*(l +w). 

---------------

Wait, but I'm getting confused here. Let me re-calculate:

The four walls consist of two walls of length l and height h, and two walls of width w and height h. So the total area is 2*(l*h) + 2*(w*h) = 2h(l + w). Yes, that's correct. So the total area is 2h*(l +w). 

Now, the problem says to subtract 15 m² for doors and windows. So the area to be covered with paper is (2h(l +w) - 15). 

The cost is 260 Rs, which is equal to (Area to cover) * (cost per square meter). The cost per square meter here is 4 Rs/m² (as calculated earlier). Therefore:

(2h(l + w) -15) * 4 = 260.

So let me write that equation:

4*(2h(l + w) -15) = 260

Divide both sides by 4:

2h(l + w) -15 = 65

Then, 2h(l + w) = 65 +15 = 80

So 2h(l + w) =80.



---------------

But wait, from the ratio given earlier, the height h is in a ratio of 2:5 compared to semi-perimeter (l + w). Let me recall:

The ratio of height to semi-perimeter (l +w) is 2:5. So h/(l + w) = 2/5 → h = (2/5)(l +w). 

So substituting h into the equation above:

2 * h * (l + w) =80.

But h is (2/5)(l +w), so substitute that in:

2*(2/5)(l +w) * (l +w) =80

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 2*(2/5) = 4/5. Then (l +w)^2 multiplied by 4/5 equals 80. 

So (4/5)*(l + w)^2 =80 → (l +w)^2 =80*(5/4)= 100 → (l +w)^2 = 100 → l +w =10 m. 

Because semi-perimeter is l +w, so that's 10 meters. Then, since h = (2/5)*(l +w) → h = (2/5)*10 =4 meters. 

Hmm, so that would be 4 meters. Looking at the options, option C is 4m. 



---------------

Wait, but let me check the steps again to be sure I didn't make a mistake.

Let me go through again:

The ratio h/(l +w) =2/5 → h = (2/5)(l +w).

Total wall area is 2h(l +w). The cost equation: (2h(l +w) -15) *4 =260 → 4*(2h(l +w) -15) =260 → 2h(l +w) -15 =65 → 2h(l +w)=80. 

Substituting h = (2/5)(l +w) into 2h(l +w):

2*(2/5)(l +w)*(l +w) = (4/5)(l +w)^2 =80 → (l +w)^2 = (80*5)/4 = 100 → l +w=10.

Therefore h is (2/5)*10 =4. So the height is 4 meters. 

Looking at the options, C is 4m. So that's the answer. 



---------------

But wait, let me check if I made any mistake in the cost calculation. Let's see:

Total area needed is (total walls area -15). The cost is based on the area covered, which is (2h(l +w) -15). The cost per square meter is calculated by the price of the paper. 

The paper is 50 cm wide. The cost is Rs 2 per meter. So each meter of the paper's length is 0.5 m wide, so the area per meter of the paper is 0.5 m². The cost for that meter of paper is Rs2. So per square meter, the cost is 2 / 0.5 =4 Rs per m². So yes, that part is correct. 

Thus, the equations are correct. So the answer is C)4m.


The problem involves a room where the height to semi-perimeter ratio is 2:5. Let the height be \( h \) and the semi-perimeter (length + width) be \( S \). Thus, \( h = \frac{2}{5}S \). The cost to paper the walls, excluding 15 m² for doors and windows, is Rs.260. The paper is 50 cm wide (0.5 m) and costs Rs.2 per meter, implying a cost of Rs.4 per m² (since each meter of paper provides 0.5 m² area).

The total wall area is \( 2h \times S \). The equation for the cost is:
\[
(2hS - 15) \times 4 = 260
\]
Simplifying:
\[
2hS - 15 = 65 \implies 2hS = 80
\]
Substituting \( h = \frac{2}{5}S \):
\[
2 \times \frac{2}{5}S \times S = 80 \implies \frac{4}{5}S^2 = 80 \implies S^2 = 100 \implies S = 10 \, \text{m}
\]
Thus, the height \( h = \frac{2}{5} \times 10 = 4 \, \text{m} \).
