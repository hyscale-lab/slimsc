Okay, let's see. The problem is asking how many children are in a city where the total population is 5,265,526 and there are 4,169,516 adults. Hmm, right. So the children would be the total population minus the number of adults, right? Because the total population includes both adults and children. 



---------------

Wait, but I need to make sure I subtract correctly. Let me write that down. So total population is 5,265,526. Adults are 4,169,516. So children = total minus adults. Let me do the subtraction.

Let me line them up:

5,265,526
-4,169,516
------------
?

Starting from the rightmost digits. 

6 minus 6 is 0. Then the next digits: 2 minus 1? 

---------------

Wait, but the second number's next digit is 1. Wait, let me check each digit step by step. 



---------------

Wait, the numbers are:

First number: 5,265,526. Breaking it down digit-wise (from right to left for subtraction):

Positions (units, tens, hundreds, etc.):

Position 1 (units place): 6
Position 2 (tens): 2
Position 3 (hundreds): 5
Position 4 (thousands): 5
Position 5 (ten thousands): 6
Position 6 (hundred thousands): 2
Position 7 (millions): 5

Second number (4,169,516):

Position 1:6
Position 2:1
Position3:5
Position4:9
Position5:6
Position6:1
Position7:4



---------------

Wait maybe it's easier to write them out as numbers. Let me subtract step by step.

Starting from the right:

Units place: 6 - 6 = 0.

Tens place: 2 -1 =1.

Hundreds place:5 -5 =0.

Thousands place: 5 -9. 

---------------

Oh wait, here we have a problem. 5 is less than 9. So we need to borrow from the next higher digit. 

So the thousands digit in the first number is 5 (since the number is 5,265,526). 

---------------

Wait, let me write them properly:

Let me write both numbers with commas for clarity:

First number: 5,265,526

Second number:4,169,516

Subtracting 4,169,516 from 5,265,526.

Let me do this subtraction step by step:

Starting from the right:

Units digit: 6 -6 =0.

Tens digit: 2 -1 =1.

Hundreds digit:5 -5 =0.

Thousands digit:5 (from first number) minus 9 (from second). Can't do that, so need to borrow 1 from the ten thousands place. The ten thousands digit in the first number is 6 (since 5,265,526 is 5,2 (millions), 6 (hundred thousands?), wait maybe I need to parse the digits correctly.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I should break down each digit properly. Let me write each number digit by digit:

First number (5,265,526):

Digits from right to left (units to millions):

Position 1 (units): 6

Position 2 (tens): 2

Position 3 (hundreds):5

Position 4 (thousands):5

Position 5 (ten thousands):6

Position 6 (hundred thousands):2

Position 7 (millions):5

Second number (4,169,516):

Positions:

1:6

2:1

3:5

4:9

5:6

6:1

7:4

So when subtracting digit by digit:

Starting at position 1 (units): 6-6=0.

Position2 (tens):2-1=1.

Position3 (hundreds):5-5=0.

Position4 (thousands):5 -9. Since 5 <9, need to borrow 1 from the next higher digit (position5). 

So borrow 1 from position5 (which is 6 in the first number). So the 6 becomes 5, and the 5 in position4 becomes 15. Then 15-9=6.

Now, position5: the original digit was 6, but we borrowed 1, so it's now 5. Then subtract the second number's position5 digit which is 6. 5 -6? Hmm, again can't do that. So need to borrow again.

Position5: 5 (after borrowing) minus 6. So need to borrow from position6. 

Position6 in first number is 2. Borrow 1 from there, so position6 becomes 1, and position5 becomes 15 (since we add 10 here? 

---------------

Wait, wait, each position is a digit. Wait, borrowing in subtraction: when you borrow from the next higher digit, you add 10 to the current digit. 

So, position5: originally 5 (after the previous borrow). Need to subtract 6. 

So borrow 1 from position6 (hundred thousands place, which is 2). So position6 becomes 1, and position5 becomes 5 +10 =15? 

---------------

Wait no. Wait, the borrow comes from the higher digit. So if you borrow from position6 (which is the hundred thousands place), then the 2 in position6 reduces by 1 to become 1, and the current position (position5, ten thousands) gets 10 added. So the current value at position5 becomes 5 (since we had already borrowed before?) 

---------------

Wait, maybe I need to track this again step by step.

Let me retrace:

After handling position4:

Position4: 15 (after borrowing) minus 9 gives 6.

Position5 (ten thousands place):

Original first number's digit here was 6. But we had to borrow 1 for the thousands place (position4). So it's now 5. 

The second number's position5 digit is 6. So 5 -6. Can't do that, so borrow from position6 (hundred thousands place).

Position6 in first number is 2. So borrow 1, making it 1, and the position5 becomes 5 +10 =15 (since borrowing 1 from the higher digit, which is worth 10 in this digit's place). 

Now, position5: 15 -6 =9.

Now moving to position6 (hundred thousands place):

Original was 2, but we borrowed 1, so it's now 1. 

Second number's position6 digit is 1. So 1 -1 =0.

Position7 (millions place):

First number has 5, second has4. 5 -4 =1.

Putting all together:

The result digits from right to left are:

Position1:0

Position2:1

Position3:0

Position4:6

Position5:9

Position6:0 (since 1-1=0?)



---------------

Wait, let me check each step again carefully.

Wait, after position5, the position6 (hundred thousands) in the first number was 2, then became 1 after borrowing. Then subtract the second number's position6 digit which is 1. So 1 -1 =0.

Position7 (millions): 5-4=1.

So the digits from position1 to 7 are:

Positions:

1:0

2:1

3:0

4:6

5:9

6:0

7:1

So combining these digits from highest to lowest (millions down to units):

The result is 1 (million), 0 (hundred thousands), 9 (ten thousands), 6 (thousands), 0 (hundreds), 1 (tens), 0 (units). 



---------------

Wait, that would be 1,096,010? Wait, let me arrange the digits properly:



---------------

Wait, the digits from position7 to 1:

Position7 is the millions digit:1

Position6 (hundred thousands):0

Position5 (ten thousands):9

Position4 (thousands):6

Position3 (hundreds):0

Position2 (tens):1

Position1 (units):0

So the number is 1,096,010? 

---------------

Wait that can't be right because 5,265,526 minus 4,169,516 should be more than a million?



---------------

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the subtraction again.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to do the subtraction numerically:

5,265,526 minus 4,169,516.

Let me subtract:

5,265,526  
-4,169,516  
= ?

Let me subtract digit by digit:

Starting from the right:

6-6 =0

2-1=1

5-5=0

5-9: can't do. So borrow 1 from the next higher digit (the ten thousands place which is 6). So the thousands digit becomes 15, and the ten thousands digit (6) becomes 5.

Then 15-9=6.

Now, moving to the ten thousands place: 5 (after borrowing) minus 6 (from the second number's ten thousands digit, which is 6? 

---------------

Wait the second number's ten thousands digit is 6?

Wait the second number is 4,169,516.

Breaking down:

4,169,516:

Millions digit:4

Hundred thousands:1 (since 1 in the 100,000 place)

Ten thousands:6 (the next digit after 1 is 6, so yes, ten thousands place is 6)

Thousands place:9 (the next digit is 9, so thousands place is 9)

Hundreds:5

Tens:1

Units:6.

So back to the ten thousands place subtraction:

First number's ten thousands digit after borrowing is 5 (since we had to borrow for the thousands place). The second number's ten thousands digit is 6. 

So 5-6 can't do. Need to borrow from the hundred thousands place. 

First number's hundred thousands digit is 2 (from 5,265,526: the digits are 5 (millions), 2 (hundred thousands), 6 (ten thousands?), wait maybe I messed up the digit breakdown. Let me write both numbers with their place values properly.



---------------

Wait, let me write the numbers again with commas as thousand separators.

First number: 5,265,526. So:

- Millions: 5

- Hundred thousands: 2 (since after the comma, the next three digits are 265, so 2 is hundred thousands)

- Ten thousands:6 (the second digit of the next three, so 2 (hundred thousands), 6 (ten thousands), 5 (thousands))



---------------

Wait maybe breaking down:

5,265,526:

- 5,000,000 (millions place:5)

- 200,000 (hundred thousands:2)

- 60,000 (ten thousands:6)

- 5,000 (thousands:5)

- 500 (hundreds:5?)



---------------

Wait no, perhaps better to split each digit:

The number is 5,265,526.

Breaking down each digit from left to right:

Digit 1 (millions place):5

Digit 2 (hundred thousands):2

Digit3 (ten thousands):6

Digit4 (thousands):5

Digit5 (hundreds):5

Digit6 (tens):2

Digit7 (units):6



---------------

Wait, perhaps I had the digits wrong earlier. Maybe that's where I messed up. Let me see:

Wait the number 5,265,526:

The digits are:

5 (millions), 2 (hundred thousands), 6 (ten thousands?), 5 (thousands?), then 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 6 (units).



---------------

Wait the breakdown is:

5,265,526:

- 5,000,000 (millions)

- 200,000 (hundred thousands)

- 60,000 (ten thousands)

- 5,000 (thousands)

- 500 (hundreds)

- 20 (tens)

- 6 (units)

Yes. So the digits are:

Millions:5

Hundred thousands:2

Ten thousands:6

Thousands:5

Hundreds:5

Tens:2

Units:6

So when subtracting 4,169,516 from this:

Second number:4,169,516 is:

4,000,000 (millions)

100,000 (hundred thousands)

60,000 (ten thousands)

9,000 (thousands)

500 (hundreds)

10 (tens)

6 (units)

So let's write both numbers with their digits in each place:

First number (minuend):

Millions:5

Hundred thousands:2

Ten thousands:6

Thousands:5

Hundreds:5

Tens:2

Units:6

Second number (subtrahend):

Millions:4

Hundred thousands:1

Ten thousands:6

Thousands:9

Hundreds:5

Tens:1

Units:6

Now, perform subtraction digit by digit, starting from units.

Units:6-6=0.

Tens:2-1=1.

Hundreds:5-5=0.

Thousands:5 -9. Can't do. Need to borrow.

So, thousands place: borrow 1 from the ten thousands place. 

The ten thousands place in the first number is 6. So borrow 1, making it 5, and add 10 to the thousands place (5 becomes 15). 

So thousands place now is 15-9=6.

Ten thousands place is now 5 (after borrowing). 

Now subtract the ten thousands digits: first number's ten thousands is 5 (after borrow), minus subtrahend's 6. Can't do. Need to borrow again.

Borrow from the hundred thousands place. 

Hundred thousands digit in first number is 2. Borrow 1, making it 1, and add 10 to the ten thousands place (5 becomes 15).

Now ten thousands place is 15 -6=9.

Hundred thousands digit is now 1 (since we borrowed 1 from the original 2). 

Now subtract hundred thousands place: first has 1, subtrahend has 1. 1-1=0.

Millions place: 5-4=1.

Putting all together:

Millions:1

Hundred thousands:0 (since 1-1=0)

Ten thousands:9

Thousands:6

Hundreds:0 (from the hundreds digit subtraction which was 5-5=0?)



---------------

Wait, wait, let me check each digit again:

Wait after the borrow steps:

After handling thousands and ten thousands:

Hundreds place was 5-5=0. Correct.

So the hundreds digit is 0.

Tens was 2-1=1.

Units 0.

So the digits:

Millions:1

Hundred thousands:0 (because after borrowing, the hundred thousands was 2 became 1, then subtract the subtrahend's 1 (since subtrahend's hundred thousands digit is 1?), so 1-1=0.



---------------

Wait, the hundred thousands digit of the first number after borrowing is 1 (since we borrowed 1 from the original 2). 

The subtrahend's hundred thousands digit is 1. 

So 1 (from first number) minus 1 (second number) =0.

Yes.

Then ten thousands digit is 9 (as calculated).

Thousands digit is6.

Hundreds digit 0.

Tens 1.

Units 0.

So putting all digits together:

Millions:1

Hundred thousands:0

Ten thousands:9

Thousands:6

Hundreds:0

Tens:1

Units:0

So the number is 1,096,010?



---------------

Wait, let me write it out:

1 (million) =1,000,000

0 hundred thousands = 0

9 ten thousands =90,000 → total so far 1,090,000

6 thousands =6,000 → 1,096,000

0 hundreds → stays same.

1 ten → 10 → total 1,096,010

0 units.

Hmm, but that seems low. 

---------------

Wait the original numbers are 5,265,526 minus 4,169,516. Let me check with another method.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me try another way.

Let me compute 5,265,526 minus 4,169,516.

Subtract the millions first: 5,000,000 -4,000,000 =1,000,000.

Then subtract the remaining parts:

265,526 (from first number) minus 169,516 (from second number).



---------------

Wait, 265,526 minus 169,516.

265,526 - 169,516.

Let me compute that:

265,526  
-169,516  
= ?

265,526 minus 160,000 is 105,526. Then subtract 9,516 more.

105,526 -9,516 = 96,010. 

So total would be 1,000,000 +96,010 =1,096,010. 

Hmm, so that's the same as before. So the answer would be 1,096,010. 

But looking at the options given:

Options are:

A)1095961

B)1065961

C)1085961

D)1097961

E)1096061



---------------

Wait, 1,096,010 is 1,096,010. None of the options exactly match. 

---------------

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

Wait the problem says the population is 5,265,526 and the adults are 4,169,516. So children = total minus adults.



---------------

Wait maybe I miscalculated the subtraction. Let me try with another approach.

Let me write both numbers:

5,265,526

-4,169,516

------------

Let me subtract digit by digit again carefully:

Starting from the rightmost digit:

Units:6-6=0.

Tens:2-1=1.

Hundreds:5-5=0.

Thousands place:5 (from first number) minus 9 (second number). Since 5<9, borrow 1 from the ten thousands place. 

The ten thousands digit in first number is 6. Borrow 1 → becomes 5. The thousands digit becomes 15. 15-9=6.

Now ten thousands digit is 5 (after borrowing). 

Ten thousands place:5 (first) minus 6 (second). 5-6 can't do. So need to borrow from hundred thousands place. 

Hundred thousands digit in first number is 2. Borrow 1 → becomes 1. Add 10 to the ten thousands digit (5 becomes 15). 

15-6=9.

Now hundred thousands digit is 1 (since borrowed 1 from original 2). 

Hundred thousands place: 1 (first) minus 1 (second's hundred thousands digit) → 0.

Millions place:5-4=1.

Putting it all together:

The result is 1,096,010.

Hmm, so that's the same as before. But looking at the options, none of them is exactly 1,096,010. 

---------------

Wait the options are:

A)1,095,961

B)1,065,961

C)1,085,961

D)1,097,961

E)1,096,061



---------------

Wait, the closest is option E which is 1,096,061. But that's 51 more than my result. 

---------------

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the hundreds place?

Wait let me check again:

Wait the hundreds place in the first number is 5 (from 5,265,526: the hundreds digit is the fifth digit from the right. Let's see:

Breaking down 5,265,526 again:

Digits from right:

6 (units), 2 (tens), 5 (hundreds), 5 (thousands), 6 (ten thousands), 2 (hundred thousands), 5 (millions). 



---------------

Wait, the hundreds digit is the third from the right, which is 5. The subtrahend's hundreds digit is 5 (from 4,169,516: the hundreds digit is the third from the right, which is 5). So 5-5=0. That's correct.

Tens digit: 2 (first) minus 1 (second) → 1. Correct.

Units:6-6=0. 

Thousands digit after borrowing became 15-9=6.

Ten thousands after borrowing was 15-6=9.

Hundred thousands digit:1-1=0.

Millions:1.

So the digits are 1,0 (hundred thousands),9 (ten thousands),6 (thousands),0 (hundreds),1 (tens),0 (units). So 1,096,010. 

Hmm. So perhaps the options have a typo? Or maybe I made a mistake in the problem's numbers?



---------------

Wait let me recheck the problem statement. The population is 5,265,526 and the adults are 4,169,516. So children are total minus adults. 



---------------

Wait maybe I made an error in the thousands place. Let me recheck the thousands digit.

First number's thousands digit is 5 (from 5,265,526, the thousands place is the fourth digit from the right, which is 5). The second number's thousands digit is 9 (from 4,169,516, the thousands digit is the fourth from the right, which is 9). 

So 5 -9 requires borrowing. So borrow 1 from ten thousands (6 becomes 5), then 15-9=6. That's correct.

Ten thousands place after borrowing is 5. Then subtract the subtrahend's ten thousands digit (6). 5-6 needs borrow. So borrow from hundred thousands (2 becomes 1). Then ten thousands becomes 15. 15-6=9. Correct.

Hundred thousands digit: 1 (after borrow) minus the subtrahend's 1 (since the second number's hundred thousands is 1). So 1-1=0. 

Millions digit:5-4=1.

Yes. So the result is indeed 1,096,010. But none of the options match exactly. 



---------------

Wait looking at option E:1,096,061. That's 51 more. Hmm. 

---------------

Wait maybe I made an error in the hundreds place? Let's see.

Wait the hundreds digit in first number is 5, the second is 5. 5-5=0. So that's okay.



---------------

Wait maybe the thousands digit? The thousands digit in the result is 6. So 6 in thousands place. 

Wait let me think again. Let me do the subtraction in another way.

Let me compute 5,265,526 minus 4,169,516.

Let me subtract 4,000,000 from 5,265,526: that gives 1,265,526.

Now subtract the remaining 169,516 from that.

1,265,526 minus 169,516.

Let me compute 1,265,526 - 100,000 =1,165,526

Subtract 69,516 more:

1,165,526 -69,516.

Compute 1,165,526 -60,000 =1,105,526

Then subtract 9,516: 1,105,526 -9,516 = 1,096,010.

Same result. So that's correct. 

Hmm, the options given don't have this number. 

---------------

Wait maybe I misread the numbers?

Let me check the problem again. 

Question says population is 5,265,526 and adults are 4,169,516. 

Yes. So the calculation is correct. The result is 1,096,010. But the options don't have that. The closest is option E, which is 1,096,061. 



---------------

Wait perhaps I made a mistake in the tens digit? Let me see:

The tens digit in the first number is 2 (the second digit from the right in 5,265,526). The second number's tens digit is 1 (from 4,169,516). So 2-1=1. That's correct.

The hundreds digit is 5-5=0. 



---------------

Wait perhaps the thousands digit was miscalculated? 

Wait 5 (original thousands digit) plus 10 (from borrow) is 15, minus 9 gives 6. So thousands place is 6. So the thousands digit is 6. 



---------------

Wait let me write the number again: 1,096,010. 

So in digits: 1 (million), 0 (hundred thousands), 9 (ten thousands), 6 (thousands), 0 (hundreds), 1 (tens), 0 (units). So that's 1,096,010. 

Hmm. The options given do not include this. Maybe I made a mistake in the problem's numbers?



---------------

Wait the options are:

A)1095961 → 1,095,961

B)1065961 → 1,065,961

C)1085961 → 1,085,961

D)1097961 → 1,097,961

E)1096061 → 1,096,061

Hmm, the closest is E, but it has 61 in the last two digits instead of 10. 



---------------

Wait maybe I miscalculated the units digit?

Wait units digit is 6-6=0, correct.

Tens digit 2-1=1. 

So the last two digits are 10, so the number ends with 10, so the options should have ...010, but none do. 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's numbers. Let me recheck the problem's numbers again.

The problem states:

Population of the city is 5,265,526.

Adults are 4,169,516.

So the subtraction is correct. 



---------------

Wait maybe the question is a trick question? Like, children are total minus adults, but maybe the population includes non-adults (children), so yes. 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's numbers, but assuming that the given options are correct, maybe I made an error.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the numbers were written with commas as thousand separators differently. Like maybe the numbers are written with commas in different places. 

---------------

Wait, for example, in some countries commas are used as decimal separators, but in the problem it's specified as population numbers, so commas are thousand separators.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe I need to check the subtraction again.

Let me try using calculator-like approach.

Let me write 5,265,526 minus 4,169,516.

Subtract the numbers:

5,265,526  
-4,169,516  
= ?

Let me subtract digit by digit:

Starting from the right:

6-6 =0

2-1=1

5-5=0

5 (thousands place) minus 9 (thousands place in subtrahend). Can't do, borrow 1 from ten thousands place (6 →5). 15-9=6.

Ten thousands place now 5 (original 6 minus 1) minus 6 (subtrahend's ten thousands digit). Can't do, borrow 1 from hundred thousands place (2 →1). So ten thousands becomes 15. 15-6=9.

Hundred thousands place now 1 (from original 2 minus 1) minus 1 (subtrahend's hundred thousands digit 1) →0.

Millions place:5-4=1.

Result is 1,096,010.

Hmm. The options do not have that. 



---------------

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place? Wait the hundreds digit in first number is 5 (the third from the right), and in the subtrahend it's 5 (third from the right in 4,169,516). So 5-5=0. 



---------------

Wait the hundreds digit is correct. 

Wait maybe the thousands digit in the first number is not 5? Let me re-express the numbers:

First number: 5,265,526. Breaking down:

5 (millions), 2 (hundred thousands), 6 (ten thousands), 5 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 6 (units).

Yes, thousands digit is 5. 

Subtrahend's thousands digit is 9 (from 4,169,516: the thousands digit is the fourth from the right, which is 9). 

So 5-9 needs borrow. 

Hmm. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the problem's numbers are written as 5,265,526 (so 5,265 thousand, 526?), but perhaps I parsed the commas incorrectly?



---------------

Wait in some notation, commas can be every three digits starting from the right. So 5,265,526 is indeed 5 million, 265 thousand, 526. 

Yes. 

Hmm. Since the given options don't include 1,096,010, perhaps there's a miscalculation. 

---------------

Alternatively, maybe I misread the numbers. Let me check again.

Wait the problem says the population is 5265526. 

---------------

Wait maybe that's 5,265,526 or 5,265,526? Yes. 

Adults are 4169516 → 4,169,516. 

Hmm. 

---------------

Alternatively, maybe the question had a typo, but given the options, perhaps I made a mistake. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is E, which is 1,096,061. Let me see the difference between my result and option E. 

My result is 1,096,010. Option E is 1,096,061. The difference is 51. 

Hmm. Let me see if I messed up in the hundreds place. 



---------------

Wait in the hundreds place: first number has 5, subtract 5 (subtrahend's hundreds digit is 5). 5-5=0. So that's correct.



---------------

Wait perhaps the ten thousands place was miscalculated. Let me recount:

After borrowing for the thousands place, the ten thousands digit becomes 5 (from 6-1). Then we need to subtract 6 (from subtrahend's ten thousands digit). 

5-6 requires borrowing, so borrow 1 from hundred thousands (2 →1), making the ten thousands digit 15. 15-6=9. 

That's correct. 

Hmm. Maybe the problem's options are wrong, but since I have to choose from them, perhaps I made a mistake in the thousands digit. 



---------------

Wait let me do the subtraction again step by step:

Let me write the numbers aligned:

 5,265,526  
-4,169,516  
------------

Starting from the right:

Units:6-6=0

Tens:2-1=1

Hundreds:5-5=0

Thousands:5 -9. Need borrow. 

Borrow from ten thousands (6 becomes 5). Thousands becomes 15. 15-9=6.

Ten thousands:5 (after borrow) -6 (subtrahend's ten thousands digit). Need borrow again. 

Borrow from hundred thousands (2 becomes 1). Ten thousands becomes 15 (5 +10). 15-6=9.

Hundred thousands:1 (after borrow) -1 (subtrahend's hundred thousands digit)=0.

Millions:5-4=1.

So the result is 1,096,010. 

Hmm. The options don't have this. 

---------------

Wait, perhaps the problem is written with different numbers. Let me check the problem again:

Question: The population of a city is 5265526. If there are 4169516 adults in the city, how many children are there in the city?

Yes. So 5265526 minus 4169516. 



---------------

Wait maybe the numbers are written without commas, so 5265526 is 5,265,526 and 4169516 is 4,169,516. 

Hmm. 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I added instead of subtracted? Let me check that possibility. 

If I added them, it would be way larger, so no. 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the question is total minus adults gives children, which is correct. 

Hmm. Since none of the options match, maybe I made a mistake. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the options again for possible typos.

Option E is 1096061. Let me see what that is. 1,096,061. The difference between this and my result is 51. Let me see where that could come from. 



---------------

Wait perhaps in the hundreds place, I have 0, but maybe it should be 5-5=0, so that's correct. 



---------------

Wait, perhaps the thousands digit is 6, but maybe I made an error there. Let me see: the thousands digit after borrowing was 15-9=6. 

Hmm. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe I should try to see which option is closest. 

The options are:

A)1,095,961 → 1,095,961 vs my 1,096,010. The difference is 49. 

E)1,096,061 → difference is 51. 

Hmm, neither is exact. 



---------------

Wait maybe I made an error in the ten thousands place calculation. Let me see:

After borrowing, ten thousands digit was 5 (from original 6 minus 1 borrow for thousands place). Then we had to borrow again from hundred thousands, making it 15. 15-6=9. So that's correct. 

Hmm. Maybe the question has a typo and one of the numbers is different. 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, and I made a mistake in calculation. 

Wait let me try another way. Let me compute 5,265,526 -4,169,516 using another method. 

Let me subtract 4,169,516 from 5,265,526:

5,265,526 minus 4,000,000 is 1,265,526.

Then subtract 169,516 from that:

1,265,526 minus 100,000 is 1,165,526.

Minus 69,516 more:

1,165,526 - 69,516 = ?

1,165,526 minus 60,000 is 1,105,526.

Minus 9,516:

1,105,526 minus 9,000 is 1,096,526.

Minus 516: 1,096,526 - 516 = 1,096,010. 

Same result again. 

Hmm. Since the options do not include this, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's numbers. But assuming the problem is correct, maybe I need to recheck the options again. 



---------------

Wait the options are:

A)1095961 → 1,095,961

B)1065961 → 1,065,961

C)1085961 → 1,085,961

D)1097961 →1,097,961

E)1096061 →1,096,061



---------------

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place. Let me see:

The tens digit in the first number is 2 (from 5,265,526: the second digit from the right is 2). The second number's tens digit is 1 (from 4,169,516: second digit is 1). So 2-1=1. Correct. 

So the tens digit is 1. 

The hundreds digit is 0. 

So the last three digits are 010. So the correct answer ends with 010. None of the options have that. 

Hmm. This is perplexing. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo and the adult number is 4,169,516, but perhaps it's 4,169,516 (which is what I used). 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the population is 5,265,526 and the adults are 4,169,516. 



---------------

Wait, maybe I should try adding the answer options to the adults to see which gives the total population. 

Let's try option E (1,096,061) plus 4,169,516:

1,096,061 +4,169,516. 

Adding:

1,096,061  
+4,169,516  
=?

Adding units:1+6=7

Tens:6+1=7

Hundreds:0+5=5

Thousands:6+9=15 → carry over 1.

Ten thousands:9 (from first number's ten thousands digit?) 

---------------

Wait let me write the numbers:

1,096,061 is:

1 (millions), 0 (hundred thousands),9 (ten thousands),6 (thousands),0 (hundreds),6 (tens),1 (units).

4,169,516 is:

4 (millions),1 (hundred thousands),6 (ten thousands),9 (thousands),5 (hundreds),1 (tens),6 (units).

Adding them:

Millions:1+4=5.

Hundred thousands:0+1=1.

Ten thousands:9+6=15 → write 5, carryover 1.

Thousands:6+9=15 plus carryover 1 →16 → write6, carryover1.

Hundreds:0+5=5 plus carryover1 →6.

Tens:6+1=7.

Units:1+6=7.



---------------

Wait let's do it step by step:

1,096,061  
+4,169,516  
=?

Units:1+6=7

Tens:6+1=7

Hundreds:0+5=5

Thousands:6 (from first) +9 (second) =15 → write 5, carryover1.

Ten thousands:9 (first) +6 (second)=15 plus carryover1 →16 → write6, carryover1.

Hundred thousands:0 +1 (second) =1 plus carryover1 →2.

Millions:1+4=5.

So total is 5,265,577. 

But the population is supposed to be 5,265,526. So that's 51 over. 

Hmm. So option E gives a total that's 51 higher than the given population. 

If I try option A:1,095,961 +4,169,516:

1,095,961 +4,169,516.

Units:1+6=7

Tens:6+1=7

Hundreds:9+5=14 →4 carryover1.

Thousands:5+9+1=15 →5 carryover1.

Ten thousands:9+6+1=16 →6 carryover1.

Hundred thousands:0+1+1=2.

Millions:1+4=5.

So total is 5,265,477. 

Which is 5,265,477 vs required 5,265,526. That's 49 less. 

Hmm. So neither matches. 

The correct result is 1,096,010. Which is not among the options. 



---------------

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in reading the population as 5,265,526. Let me check the problem again:

The question states: "The population of a city is 5265526. If there are 4169516 adults in the city, how many children are there in the city?"

Yes, so 5,265,526 minus 4,169,516 is 1,096,010. 

Since this is not among the options, perhaps there's an error in the problem's options. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, and there's a typo in the options. 

Alternatively, maybe I misread the numbers. Let me check the numbers again:

Population:5265526 → 5,265,526. 

Adults:4169516 →4,169,516. 

Yes. 

Hmm. Since the options don't include the correct result, perhaps the question has a mistake. But since I must choose from the options given, perhaps the closest one is option E, which differs by 51. Or maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the thousands place. Let me try the subtraction again:

5,265,526  
-4,169,516  
=?

Let me write them aligned:

5,265,526  
-4,169,516  
------------

Starting from the right:

Units:6-6=0

Tens:2-1=1

Hundreds:5-5=0

Thousands:5-9 → borrow, so 15-9=6, borrow 1 from ten thousands.

Ten thousands:6 becomes 5 after borrow. Now subtract ten thousands place:5 -6 → need borrow. 

Borrow from hundred thousands (2 →1). Ten thousands becomes 15. 15-6=9.

Hundred thousands:1 -1 (from the subtrahend's hundred thousands digit 1) →0.

Millions:5-4=1.

Result:1,096,010. 

So I think this is correct. 

Since the options don't include this, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's options. However, the closest option is E)1096061. 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. 

Wait, the hundreds digit in the first number is 5, and in the subtrahend it's 5. 5-5=0. That's correct. 

Tens digit is 2-1=1. 

Units 0. 

So the last three digits are 010. 

The options' last three digits are:

A: 961 → ends with 961

B:961 → ends with 961

C:961 → 961

D:961 →961

E:061 → ends with 061.

So the correct answer's last three digits are 010, but the options have 061 or 961. 

Hmm. This is confusing. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question and children are adults? No, that doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of adults minus children, but no. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the numbers were swapped. If I subtract the other way: 4,169,516 minus 5,265,526 would be negative, which isn't an option. 

Hmm. 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the ten thousands place calculation. Let me see:

After borrowing for thousands place, the ten thousands digit was 5 (6-1). Then subtracting 6 (subtrahend's ten thousands digit) requires borrowing. 

So borrow 1 from hundred thousands (2 →1), making ten thousands 15. 15-6=9. 

Yes. 

Hmm. 

Well, given that the calculation results in 1,096,010 which isn't listed, but the closest option is E, which is 1,096,061. 

The difference between them is 51. 



---------------

Wait maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. 

Wait the hundreds digit in the first number is 5 (from 5,265,526: the hundreds place is the third from the right, which is 5). The subtrahend's hundreds digit is 5 (third from the right in 4,169,516). 

5-5=0. 

Yes. 

Hmm. 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider commas differently. For example, if the population was written as 52,655,26 and adults as 41,695,16. 



---------------

Wait that would be 52,655,26 which is way larger than the given options. 

Alternatively, perhaps the numbers are written without commas as 5265526 and 4169516. Let me check the subtraction again:

5265526  
-4169516  
=?

Subtracting digit by digit:

Starting from the right:

6-6=0

2-1=1

5-5=0

5-9 → borrow. 

Borrow from the next digit (the fourth from the right, which is 5). So the thousands digit becomes 15. 



---------------

Wait, the digits are:

5265526 → the digits from right:

Position1:6

Position2:2

Position3:5

Position4:5

Position5:6

Position6:2

Position7:5

Subtrahend:

4169516 → digits:

Position1:6

Position2:1

Position3:5

Position4:9

Position5:6

Position6:1

Position7:4

So position4 (thousands place) in minuend is5, subtrahend is9. So borrow from position5 (6 →5). 

Position4 becomes 15. 15-9=6. 

Position5 is now5 (6-1). 

Position5's digit (ten thousands place) is5 (minuend) minus 6 (subtrahend). 

Need to borrow from position6 (2 →1). 

Position5 becomes15 (5+10). 15-6=9.

Position6 (hundred thousands) is now1. 

Subtract position6:1-1=0. 

Position7:5-4=1.

So the result is 1,096,010. 

Same as before. 

Hmm. So I think the correct answer is 1,096,010, but since it's not an option, there must be a mistake in the problem's options. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the question is written incorrectly and the adult count is 4,169,516, but the population is 5,265,526. 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the options have a typo and E should be 1096010, which would be option E as 1096061 might be a typo. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe I should choose the closest option. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is in another way. 



---------------

Wait, let me try option E: 1096061. 

If I add that to 4,169,516, I get:

1,096,061 +4,169,516 =5,265,577.

The population is 5,265,526. 

The difference is 5,265,577-5,265,526=51. So the addition is over by 51. 

Hmm. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe I made an error in the ten thousands place. Let me see:

Ten thousands digit after borrowing is 15 (from 5+10), subtract 6 gives 9. 

Yes. 

Hmm. 

Since none of the options match, but the closest is E, which is off by 51, and the other options are off by more, perhaps the correct answer is E. 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's numbers. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the thousands digit. 



---------------

Wait, let me see:

The thousands digit in the minuend is5. 

After borrowing from the ten thousands place (6→5), the thousands digit becomes 15. 

15-9=6. 

Yes. 

Hmm. 

I'm not sure, but given that the options don't have the correct answer, but the closest is option E, which is 1,096,061, I'll choose that. 



---------------

Wait, but the problem might have a different way. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundred thousands place. 



---------------

Wait the hundred thousands digit after borrowing was 1 (from original 2), subtract the subtrahend's hundred thousands digit of1, giving 0. 

So that's correct. 

Hmm. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the question is written with numbers in reverse? Like population is 4,169,516 and adults 5,265,526? But that would give a negative number. 

Hmm. 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option A. 

Wait option A is 1,095,961. 

Adding that to adults:1,095,961 +4,169,516 =5,265,477, which is 49 less than the population. 

Hmm. 

The correct answer is not present. 

Given that, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I should go with option E since it's the only one that has the first three digits 1,096, but with different last three digits. 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps there is an error in the problem's options. 

Since this is a multiple-choice question, and the options don't include the correct answer, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. 



---------------

Wait let me try the subtraction using a different method:

5,265,526 minus 4,169,516.

Let me subtract 4,169,516 from 5,265,526.

5,265,526 - 4,000,000 = 1,265,526.

Now subtract 169,516 from 1,265,526:

1,265,526 - 100,000 = 1,165,526.

Subtract 60,000 → 1,105,526.

Subtract 9,516 → 

1,105,526 - 9,000 = 1,096,526.

Subtract 516 → 1,096,526 - 516 = 1,096,010.

Same result again. 

Hmm. 

Since I've verified this multiple times and the options don't have it, I think there must be a typo in the options. But since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps the closest is option E. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's numbers. Let me check the problem again. 

The problem states:

"The population of a city is 5265526. If there are 4169516 adults in the city, how many children are there in the city?"

Yes. So population minus adults equals children. 

Hmm. 

I think the correct answer is 1,096,010, but since it's not listed, perhaps the options are incorrect. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds digit. 

Wait hundreds digit in first number is 5, subtract 5 →0. 

Yes. 

Hmm. 

I think I'll have to choose option E as the closest possible, even though it's incorrect by 51. 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the ten thousands digit. 

Wait ten thousands digit after borrowing was 15-6=9. 

Yes. 

Hmm. 

I'm stuck. Since the calculation is correct, but the options don't have it, but the closest is E, I'll go with E. 



---------------

Wait, but the options are:

E)1096061. 

The difference between the correct answer and E is 51. 



---------------

Wait let me see the options again:

A)1,095,961 (diff 49 less)

B)1,065,961 (30,000 less)

C)1,085,961 (10,000 less)

D)1,097,961 (1,951 more)

E)1,096,061 (51 more)

So E is closest in the higher digits. 

Perhaps the question intended option E but had a typo. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the tens digit. 

Wait, the tens digit is 2-1=1. 

Yes. 

Hmm. 

Since I can't find any error in my calculation, but the options don't have the correct answer, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's numbers. 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the population is 5,265,526 and the adults are 4,169,516. 



---------------

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option E, and there's a typo in the options where it should be 1096010, but written as 1096061. 

Given that, I'll choose option E as the closest.


The problem requires calculating the number of children by subtracting the number of adults from the total population. 

**Step-by-Step Calculation:**
1. **Total Population:** 5,265,526  
2. **Adults:** 4,169,516  
3. **Children = Total Population - Adults:**  
   \[
   5,265,526 - 4,169,516 = 1,096,010
   \]

**Analysis of Options:**  
The calculated result, 1,096,010, is not listed among the provided options. However, the closest option is **E (1,096,061)**, which differs by 51. This discrepancy might be due to a typo in the options. Given the closest match and the problem constraints, **E** is selected.

**Answer: E**  

Answer: E
