Okay, so I need to figure out how far A is from home after those movements. Let me start by visualizing the path step by step. Maybe drawing a coordinate system would help. Let's consider A's starting point as the origin (0,0). 

First, A goes 3 km south. Since south is the negative y-direction, that would take them to (0, -3). Then they go 5 km east, which is the positive x-direction. So adding 5 to the x-coordinate, that brings them to (5, -3). 

Next, they travel 3 km north. North is the positive y-direction, so adding 3 to the y-coordinate. The current y was -3, so adding 3 would bring it back to 0. So now they're at (5, 0). 

Finally, they go 2 km west. West is the negative x-direction, so subtract 2 from the x-coordinate. 5 minus 2 is 3. So ending up at (3, 0). 

Now, the question is how far this point (3,0) is from the origin (0,0). Since the y-coordinate is 0, the distance is just the absolute value of the x-coordinate, which is 3 km.

Wait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't mix up any directions.

Wait another thought: starting at (0,0). South 3: (0,-3). East 5: (5,-3). North 3: (5,0). West 2: (3,0). Yes. So the displacement is 3 km east of home, so the answer should be 3 km, which is option A. But let me see if the options have that. The options are A)3, B)2, etc. So the answer is A?


To determine how far A is from home, we track their movements on a coordinate system starting at (0,0):

1. **3 km South**: Moves to (0, -3).
2. **5 km East**: Moves to (5, -3).
3. **3 km North**: Moves to (5, 0) (returning to the original y-coordinate).
4. **2 km West**: Moves to (3, 0).

The final position is (3, 0), which is 3 km east of the origin (home). The straight-line distance from home is therefore 3 km.

Answer: A)3km
