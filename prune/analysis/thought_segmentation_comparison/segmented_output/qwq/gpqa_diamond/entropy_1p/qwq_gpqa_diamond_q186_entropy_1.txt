Okay, I need to figure out how many of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph when used with one of the VLT's 8m telescopes. The key requirement is achieving a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. 

First, I'll recall that the ESPRESSO spectrograph's capabilities depend on the telescope's light-gathering power, the star's brightness, and the exposure time. The link

---------------

 provided might have details on its limiting magnitude or how S/N is calculated. Since I can't access the link right now, I'll have to rely on general astronomical knowledge and typical specs for such instruments.

The S/N for a spectrograph is generally proportional to the square root of the total number of photons collected. The number of photons depends on the star's apparent magnitude, the telescope's aperture, exposure time, and the efficiency of the instrument. 

The formula for apparent magnitude (m) is related to absolute magnitude (M) by the distance modulus: m - M = 5 log10(d / 10 pc), where d is the distance in parsecs. So apparent magnitude can be calculated if we know absolute magnitude and distance.

Let me start with the given stars. The first two are Canopus and Polaris. I need to find their apparent magnitudes. 

Canopus is the second brightest star in the sky, with an apparent magnitude of about -0.72. That's super bright. Polaris, the North Star, has an apparent magnitude around 2.0. Both of these are much brighter than most stars, so their S/N should be high. But I need to confirm if even with their brightness, they meet the 10 S/N requirement. Since they are so bright, likely

---------------

 yes. But maybe the instrument has a limit? Wait, high brightness could be a problem if the star is too bright and saturates the detector, but typically

---------------

 spectrographs can handle bright stars as long as they're not overexposing. Since the exposure is 1 hour, which is a long time, but maybe for very bright stars, even a short exposure would be enough, so 1 hour would give a very high S/N. So Canopus and Polaris are probably detectable.

Now the other options are stars with absolute magnitude 15 and varying distances. Let's compute their apparent magnitudes. The formula again: m = M + 5 log10(d / 10). 

For option c: distance 10 pc. So m = 15 + 5*log10(10/10) = 15 + 5*0 = 15. 

d) 200 pc: m = 15 +5*log10(200/10) = 15 +5*log10(20). log10(20) is ~1.3010. So 5*1.3010 ≈6.505, so m ≈15+6.5=21.5?

Wait, no, wait: wait

---------------

, the formula is m - M = 5 log(d/10). So m = M + 5 log(d/10). So for d=10, log(1) =0, so m=15. For d=200, log(200/10)=log(20)= ~1.301, so m=15+5*1.301≈15+6.5≈21.5. 

Similarly for e (5pc): m=15+5*log(5/10)=15+5*log(0.5)= 15 +5*(-0.3010)= ~15-1.5≈13.5. 

f:50pc. log(50/10)=log(5)= ~0.69897. So 5*0.699≈3.495. So m≈15+3.5≈18.5.

So the apparent magnitudes are:

c: 15, e: ~13.5, f: ~18.5, d: ~21.5.

Now, the next step is to find out what the limiting magnitude of ESPRESSO is when using an 8m VLT telescope. 

I remember that the VLT's primary mirror is 8m, so the collecting area is proportional to the square of the diameter. The limiting magnitude for spectroscopy depends on the instrument's sensitivity, the exposure time, and the required S/N.

Looking up typical values (from memory), ESPRESSO is a high-precision radial velocity instrument. Its limiting magnitude is around V~15 for 1-hour exposure for high S/N. But I need to be precise here. 

Wait, maybe I can recall that ESPRESSO's website says it can reach V ~15 for 1 hour to get S/N ~100. But the question requires S/N of 10. Since S/N is proportional to sqrt(exposure time) and sqrt(photons), which depends on the star's brightness. So if a star of V=15 gives S/N 100 in 1 hour, then to get S/N=10, you need 1/100 the photons, which would be 1/100 the exposure time. But since exposure is fixed at 1 hour, then

---------------

 a star 100 times dimmer would give S/N 10. 

Alternatively, perhaps the limiting magnitude for S/N=10 per pixel is higher (fainter) than for S/N=100. Let me think in terms of magnitudes. Each magnitude step is a factor of about 2.5 in brightness. 

If the S

---------------

/N is proportional to sqrt(flux), then to get S/N 10 instead of 100, you can have a flux 1/100 as much. Since flux is related to magnitude by F = F0 * 10^(-0.4m). So, if F

---------------

2/F1 = 1/100 = 10^(-0.4*(m2 - m1)), so:

10^(-0.4*(m2 - m1)) = 1/100 → -0.4*(m2 - m1) = log10(1/100) = -2 → m2 - m1 = 5. 

So, if a star of magnitude m1 gives S/N=100 in 1 hour, then a star 5 magnitudes fainter (m1 +5) would give S/N=10. 

Thus, if the ESPRESSO can get S/N=100 for V=15 in 1 hour, then S/N=10 would be possible for V=20 (since 15+5=20). 

Wait, but I'm not sure if the original

---------------

 limit is V=15 for 100. Alternatively, maybe the actual specs say something else. 

Alternatively, perhaps the ESPRESSO's website states that for a V=13 star, in

---------------

 1 hour, you get S/N ~ 100 per pixel. Let me try to recall or think of other ways. 

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 the formula for S/N is given by:

S/N ≈ (t * A * η * F ) / sqrt( (t * A * η * F) + (background * t * A) ) )

But maybe

---------------

 that's overcomplicating. 

Alternatively, if I can remember that the typical limiting magnitude for high S/N spectroscopy with an 8m telescope is around V=15. Let's assume that for a 1-hour exposure, a star of V=15 would give S/N ~10. Wait, but the question requires S/N of 10. If the instrument can do S/N of 10 at V=15, then stars brighter than that (lower V) are okay. 

Alternatively, maybe the ESPRESSO's limiting

---------------

 magnitude for S/N=10 in 1 hour is around V=20? That would allow the fainter stars. 

Hmm, this is tricky without the exact specs. But the

---------------

 key point is the stars with given absolute magnitudes and distances. Let's see:

The options are:

a) Canopus (apparent mag ~ -0.72) → definitely detectable.

b) Polaris (apparent mag ~ 2.0) → also very bright, detectable.

c) Apparent mag 15 → if the limit is 15, then this is exactly the limit. But the

---------------

 question says "at least 10 per pixel". If 15 gives exactly 10, then yes. But if the limit is a bit better (like 15.5), then maybe not. 

d) 21.5 → probably too faint.

e) 13.5 → brighter

---------------

 than 15, so yes.

f) 18.5 → depends. If the limit is 20, then yes, but if the limit is 15, then no.

Wait, let

---------------

 me think again. Suppose the ESPRESSO can achieve S/N of 10 for a V=15 star in 1 hour. Then stars brighter than that (smaller V) would have higher S/N. So the

---------------

 stars with V=13.5 (e) would be okay, V=15 (c) okay, but V=18.5 (f) would be too faint (since 18.5 is 3.5 magnitudes fainter than 15, so S/N would be 10 / sqrt(10^(0.4*3.5)). Let's compute that:

0.4*3.5 = 1.4, so 10^1.4 ≈ 25.1. So sqrt(25.1) ≈5. So S/N would be 10/5=2. That's below 10. So f's S/N would be 2, which is insufficient. 

Similarly, d is 21.5, which is 6.5 magnitudes fainter than 15. So 10^ (0.4*6.5) = 10^2.6 ≈ 398. So sqrt(398) ~20, so S/N would be 10/20 = 0.5. Not enough.

So if

---------------

 the limit is 15, then stars e (13.5), a, b, c are okay. But

---------------

 c is exactly 15, so that's the limit. So that's four stars: a, b, c, e. Wait, but wait

---------------

, the options are a-f, and the question is how many of them are detectable. Let me count again:

a: Canopus (bright, yes)

b: Polaris (yes)

c: 15 (yes if exactly the limit)

d: 21.5 (no)

e: 13.5 (yes)

f:18.5 (no)

So that would be 4 stars (a,b,c,e). But wait, maybe the limit is better than 15? Let's see. Suppose the ESPRESSO can do better. 

Alternatively, maybe the limiting

---------------

 magnitude for S/N=10 in 1 hour is higher (i.e., fainter) than 15. For instance, if the V

---------------

=15 gives S/N of 100, then the required S/N of 10 would be possible for V=15 +5 =20. Then, in that case:

c (15) would be better than needed (S/N 100), so yes.

e (13.5) yes.

f (18.5) yes (since 18.5 <20). 

Wait, then

---------------

 that would be a, b, c, e, f. That's five. 

Hmm, this is conflicting. The problem is I'm not sure what the actual limiting magnitude is. Since the question is from an exam, perhaps I need to recall

---------------

 that the ESPRESSO's website says something. 

Looking back, the user provided a link to ESO's page for ESPRESSO. Since I can't view it, but perhaps I can recall that ESPRESSO is designed for high precision radial velocity measurements. According to some sources, ESPRESSO can achieve S/N of 100 per exposure for V=13 stars in 1 hour. Then

---------------

, for S/N=10, that would correspond to V=13 +5 =18. So a star with V=18 would get S/N 10. 

Alternatively, here's another approach. Let me look up some key

---------------

 specs in my mind. ESPRESSO's website states that it has a limiting magnitude of V ~ 15 for a 1-hour exposure to reach S/N ~ 100. So for S/N=10, which is 10 times less, the magnitude limit would be 5 magnitudes fainter (since S/N scales with sqrt(flux), so 10x less S/N requires 100x less flux, which is 5 magnitudes). So 15 +5 =20. So the limiting magnitude for S/N=10 would be V=20. 

Therefore, stars with apparent magnitude up to 20 can be detected. 

Then let's re-calculate:

a) Canopus (V ~-0.72): yes.

b) Polaris (V ~2.0): yes.

c) V=15: yes (since 15 <20).

d) V=21.5: no (too faint).

e) V=13.5: yes.

f) V=18.5: yes (since 18.5 <20).

So that would be a,b,c,e,f: 5 stars. But wait, the options are a to f. So that would be 5? But the options given in the choices are A)2, B)5, C)4, D)3.

Wait, but the

---------------

 options are the stars listed in a to f. Let me recount:

a: yes (bright)

b: yes (bright)

c: 15 → yes (since 15 is within the limit of 20)

d: 21.5 → no

e:13.5 → yes

f:18.5 → yes.

Total of 5 (a,b,c,e,f). So the answer would be B)5. But wait, the

---------------

 options given in the question are:

Options:

A)2

B)5

C)4

D)3

Wait, but according

---------------

 to this calculation, the answer would be B)5. But I need to make sure about the distance calculations and the apparent

---------------

 magnitudes.

Wait, let me recheck the apparent magnitudes for the stars with given absolute magnitudes and distances:

For example, for option c: distance is 10 pc. Absolute V is 15. 

Using the formula m = M + 5 log10(d/10). 

d is 10, so d/10 is 1, log10(1)=0. So m=15+0=15. Correct.

e: 5 pc. So d/10=0.5 → log10(0.5)= -0.3010. So 5*(-0.301)= -1.505. So m=15-1.505≈13.5. Correct.

f:50 pc → d/10=5 → log10(5)=0.69897 → 5*0.69897≈3.495 → m≈15+3.495≈18.5. Correct.

d:200 pc → d/10=20 → log10(20)=1.301 → 5*1.301≈6.5 → m≈21.5. Correct.

So the apparent magnitudes are correct.

If the limiting magnitude is V=20 (for S/N=10), then all stars with V ≤20 are okay. 

Thus:

a (V~-0.72): yes

b (V~2): yes

c (V15): yes

d (V21.5): no

e (13.5): yes

f (18.5): yes.

Total of 5 stars (a,b,c,e,f). So answer is B)5.

Wait, but I

---------------

 have to be careful about Canopus and Polaris. Are there any issues with them? For instance, maybe the instrument has a magnitude limit on the bright side. But

---------------

 Canopus is extremely bright. However, spectrographs can handle bright stars as long as they don't saturate the detector. Since the exposure is 1 hour, which is a long time, but the star is so bright that even a short exposure would give high S/N. But maybe

---------------

 the instrument can't handle such bright stars? I think not. Usually, spectrographs can handle bright stars, but sometimes there's a lower limit (minimum magnitude) but in

---------------

 this case, the question doesn't mention any such constraint. The only requirement is S/N ≥10. Since Canopus and Polaris are so bright, their S/N would be way over 10. So they are okay.

Thus the total is 5. The answer is B)5.


To determine how many stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph with a 1-hour exposure and S/N ≥10, we calculate their apparent magnitudes using the distance modulus formula:  
\[
m = M + 5 \log_{10}\left(\frac{d}{10 \text{ pc}}\right)
\]  
- **Canopus (a)** has an apparent magnitude of ~-0.72, **Polaris (b)** ~2.0. Both are bright enough for high S/N.  
- **Star c (10 pc)**: \(m = 15 + 0 = 15\).  
- **Star d (200 pc)**: \(m = 15 + 6.5 \approx 21.5\).  
- **Star e (5 pc)**: \(m = 15 - 1.5 \approx 13.5\).  
- **Star f (50 pc)**: \(m = 15 + 3.5 \approx 18.5\).  

ESPRESSO’s limiting magnitude for S/N=10 in 1 hour is ~V=20. Thus:  
- **Detectable stars**: a, b, c, e, f (5 stars).  
- **Undetectable**: d (V=21.5).
