Okay, let's see. The question is about a diatomic molecule switching from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state when absorbing a photon. I need to find the momentum of that photon. Hmm, right. The molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, so I should consider both rotational and vibrational energy levels, but the question specifies the next state with the lowest possible energy. Wait, so maybe the transition is between the lowest possible energy states? Or perhaps the next state in either rotation or vibration?

First, the fundamental state is the ground state. The next state with the lowest energy would probably be the first excited state. But which mode? The problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So maybe it's the next vibrational state, since vibrational transitions usually involve higher energy than rotational transitions. Wait, but the options are in momentum, which relates to the photon's energy. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the rotational transition? Because sometimes in di

---------------

atomic molecules, the rotational transitions are lower in energy than vibrational ones. But the question mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, so perhaps the transition could be either rotational or vibrational. The problem states "next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the one with the smallest energy increase. That would be the first excited state, either rotational or vibrational, whichever requires less energy.

Wait, vibrational transitions usually require more energy than rotational. So perhaps the next

---------------

 state is the first excited rotational state. Let me confirm. Vibrational energy levels are spaced much farther apart than rotational. For example, vibrational frequencies are in the range of 10^13 to 10^14 Hz (since angular frequency here is 4e14 rad/s, which is about 6e13 Hz, since 1 Hz is 2pi rad/s). Rotational transitions are typically in the microwave region (GHz to THz), while vibrational are infrared (THz to PHz). So the energy needed for a rotational transition would be lower than vibrational. Therefore, the next possible state with the lowest energy would be a rotational transition.

Therefore, the photon's energy should correspond to the energy difference between the ground rotational state (n=0) and the first excited rotational state (n=1?), but wait, rotational states are labeled by the quantum number J. The ground state for rotation is J=0, and the next is J=1. The energy levels for rotation are given by the rigid rotor model. Wait, but the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model here. Hmm, but maybe for the rotational part, even in the non-rigid rotor, the energy levels are still approximately like the rigid rotor?



---------------

Wait, the problem says "quantum rotation-vibration model (or non-rigid rotor model)". Oh, maybe the non-rigid rotor is another name for the rotation-vibration model? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the rotation is considered as a rigid rotor and vibration as harmonic oscillator, but the question is about the next state with the lowest energy. Let me think again.

Assuming the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the ground vibrational state (v=0) and ground rotational state (J=0). To get to the next lowest energy state, the transition could be either to v=1 (first vibrational excited state) or J=1 (first rotational excited state). Since rotational transitions are lower in energy, the photon's energy should correspond to the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1. But let me verify the energy difference between those two.

The rotational energy levels for a rigid rotor are given by E_J = (ħ² / (2I)) J(J+1), where I is the moment of inertia. The energy difference between J=0 and J=1 would be E_1 - E_0 = (ħ²/(2I))(1*2 - 0) = ħ²/(2I) * 2 = ħ²/I.

Wait, wait. Let me compute the difference between J=1 and J=0. For J=0, the energy is zero. For J=1, it's (ħ²/(2I)) * 1*(1+1) = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/I. So the difference is indeed ħ²/I. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to calculate the energy of the first excited state. So the energy of the photon must match that difference. The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by p = E/c, since p = h/lambda and E = hc/lambda, so p = E/c.

Therefore, I need to compute the energy difference between J=1 and J=0, then divide by c to get the momentum.

First, compute the moment of inertia I. The molecule is diatomic with atoms X and Y. The moment of inertia is I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass. 

The reduced mass μ = (M_x * M_y)/(M_x + M_y). Wait, but the masses are given in amu. Let me note the values: Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. 

But I need to convert this into kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg. Let me compute that:

1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ 1.818 * 1.66 ≈ 3.023 (approximate). Wait, let's do it more precisely. 1.818 * 1.6605 = ?

1.818 * 1.6 = 2.9088

1.818 * 0.0605 ≈ 0.1099

Total ≈ 2.9088 + 0.1099 ≈ 3.0187. So about 3.0187e-27 kg. Wait, no: the 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 is (1.818 * 1.6605) * 1e-27. So 3.0187e-27 kg.

Wait, let me recheck:

20 amu * 2 amu = 40. Sum is 22. So μ is (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818... amu. So yes. So μ = 20/11 amu.

So converting to kg: 1 amu is 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So μ = (20/11) * 1.6605e-27 ≈ (1.818) * 1.6605e-27.

Let me compute 1.818 * 1.6605:

1.8 * 1.6605 = 2.9889

0.018 *1.6605 ≈ 0.029889

Total ≈ 2.9889 + 0.029889 ≈ 3.0188e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 3.0188e-27 kg.

The bond length R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 m, so R = 2e-10 m.

Therefore, the moment of inertia I = μ R² = 3.0188e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

Calculating R squared: (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

Multiply by μ: 3.0188e-27 *4e-20 = 12.075e-47 kg·m². Wait, 3.0188 *4 is 12.075, so 12.075e-47? Wait, 1e-27 *1e-20 is 1e-47. So yes, I ≈ 1.2075e-46 kg·m²? Wait, 12.075e-47 is the same as 1.2075e-46. Let

---------------

 me check:

3.0188e-27 *4e-20 = (3.0188 *4) * 1e-47 = 12.075 *1e-47 = 1.2075e-46 kg·m². Yes.

So I ≈ 1.2075e-46 kg·m².

Now, the energy difference between J=1 and J=0 is ΔE = (ħ²)/(I). Wait, wait, earlier I thought the difference between J=1 and J=0 was (ħ²/(2I)) * (1*(1+1) - 0) = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/I. So yes, ΔE = ħ² / I.

Let me compute that. ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² is (1.0545718e-34)^2. Let me compute that:

First, square 1.0545718e-34:

(1.0545718)^2 ≈ 1.112, so 1.112e-68 (since (e-34)^2 is e-68). So approximately 1.112e-68 J²·s².

Wait, but actually, let me do the exact calculation step by step.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s

ħ squared: (1.0545718e-34)^2 = (1.0545718)^2 * 1e-68

1.0545718 squared: 

1.05^2 = 1.1025,

0.0045718 squared is negligible, but let's do more accurately:

1.0545718 * 1.0545718:

Let me compute 1.05 * 1.05 = 1.1025.

Then, the exact

---------------

 value:

Let me use calculator steps:

1.0545718 * 1.0545718:

Multiply 1.0545718 * 1.0545718:

Approximate:

1.0545718^2 = (1 + 0.0545718)^2 = 1 + 2*0.0545718 + (0.0545718)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.1091436 + 0.002978 ≈ 1.1121216. So approximately 1.1121e-68.

So ħ² ≈ 1.1121e-68 J² s²? Wait, no. Wait, units: J·s squared would be J²·s², but actually, the units of ħ²/I is (J·s)^2/(kg·m²). Hmm, but when

---------------

 calculating the energy, the units should be J. Let me think.

Wait, the energy is E_J = (ħ²/(2I)) J(J+1). So the units of ħ²/(2I) must be J. Let me confirm units:

ħ has units of J·s. I has units kg·m². So ħ²/(2I) has units (J²·s²)/(kg·m²). But J is kg·m²/s². So substituting J: ( (kg²·m^4/s^4) * s² ) / (kg·m²) ) = (kg·m²/s²) which is J. So that's correct.

So back to the calculation: ΔE = ħ² / I.

So plugging in the numbers:

ΔE = (1.1121e-68 J²·s²) / (1.2075e-46 kg·m²)

Wait, but I

---------------

 need to be careful with the exact calculation. Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Wait, actually, let me compute the numerical value step by step:

First, ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68 J² s²? Wait, actually, the correct unit is (J·s)^2, but when divided by kg·m², the units become (J² s²)/(kg m²). Hmm, but perhaps

---------------

 I should just proceed numerically.

Wait, maybe better to compute the value numerically:

ΔE = (ħ²) / I.

So plugging in the numbers:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s

So ħ squared: (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ (1.0545718)^2 * 1e-68 ≈ 1.112 * 1e-68 (as before) so approximately 1.112e-68 J² s²? Wait, no. Wait, actually, the units are (J·s)^2, so the actual value is (1.05457e-34)^2 in (J·s)^2, but when divided by I (kg·m²), the units become (J² s²)/(kg m²). Wait, but energy

---------------

 is in J, so perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the numerical value properly

---------------

:

ΔE = ( (1.0545718e-34)^2 ) / (1.2075e-46 )

Let me compute numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 = (1.0545718)^2 * 1e-68 ≈ 1.112 * 1e-68 ≈ 1.112e-68 (in units of (J·s)^2 )

Divide by I (in kg·m²):

So (1.112e-68 J² s²) / (1.2075e-46 kg·m² )

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Wait, maybe I need to redo

---------------

 the formula.

Wait, E_J = (ħ²/(2I)) * J(J+1). So the difference between J=1 and J=0 is E_1 - E_0 = (ħ²/(2I))*(1*2 - 0) = (ħ²/(2I)) *2 = ħ² / I. So that's correct.

So the energy difference is ΔE = ħ²/(I).

So

---------------

 the calculation is ( (1.0545718e-34)^2 ) / (1.2075e-46 )

Let me compute that:

First compute numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 = (1.0545718)^2 * (1e-34)^2 = approx 1.112 * 1e-68 ≈ 1.112e-68.

Divide by denominator 1.2075e-46:

So 1.112e-68 / 1.2075e-46 = (1.112 / 1.2075) * 1e-22 ≈ (0.921) * 1e-22 ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, let me check the exponents:

1e-68 divided by 1e-46 is 1e-22. So yes. So approximately 0.921 * 1e-22 = 9.21e-23 J.

So the energy difference ΔE ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

Now, the photon's energy must be equal to this ΔE. The momentum of the photon is p = E / c, where c is the speed of light (approx 3e8 m/s).

So p = (9.21e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = (9.21 / 3) * 1e-31 ≈ 3.07 * 1e-31 = 3.07e-31 N·s? Wait, let me check:

Wait, J is kg·m²/s². So E/c has units (kg·m²/s²) / (m/s) ) = kg·m/s = N·s. So correct.

So 9.21e-23 divided by 3e8 is 9.21/(3e23+8?) Wait, 9.21e-23 divided by 3e8 is (9.21 /3) * 1e-31, which is 3.07e-31 N·s? Wait, but that seems way too small. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate.

Wait 9.21e-23 divided by 3e8:

9.21e-23 / 3e8 = (9.21/3) * 1e-31 = 3.07e-31 N·s? But looking at the options given, the options are like 1e-27 or 1e-28, so this is way too small. Hmm, that's a problem. So

---------------

 I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, so perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let's retrace.

Wait, let me check the calculation of I again. The moment of inertia.

μ is (M_x * M_y)/(M_x + M_y). Wait, M_x and M_y are in amu, so when

---------------

 calculating the reduced mass, the formula is correct. But when converting to kg, perhaps I made an error.

Wait, let me recalculate μ:

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu)/(20 + 2) = (40 amu²)/(22) = 40/22 amu = ~1.818 amu. That's correct.

Then, converting 1.818 amu to kg:

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg. So 1.818 * 1.6605e-27.

Let me compute that again:

1.818 * 1.6605:

1.8 * 1.6605 = 2.9889

0.018 * 1.6605 = 0.029889

Total: 2.9889 + 0.029889 = 3.018789. So 3.0188e-27 kg. So μ is 3.0188e-27 kg. That's correct.

R is 2 angstrom = 2e-10 m. So R squared is 4e-20 m².

Thus I = μ R² = 3.0188e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2075e-46 kg·m². Correct.

Then, the energy difference ΔE = ħ² / I.

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So (ħ)^2 is (1.0545718e-34)^2 = (1.0545718)^2 * 1e-68 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J²·s²). 

Divided by I (1.2075e-46 kg·m²):

Wait, but perhaps

---------------

 the units are confusing me. Let me think in terms of numbers:

ΔE = ( (1.0545718e-34)^2 ) / (1.2075e-46 )

Calculate numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 = (1.0545718)^2 * 1e-68 ≈ 1.112 * 1e-68 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s² ?

Wait, no, actually, the units of ħ² is (J·s)^2, and I is in kg·m². So the division gives (J²·s²)/(kg·m²). But J is kg·m²/s², so substituting:

(J²·s²)/(kg·m²) = ( (kg²·m^4/s^4) * s² ) / (kg·m²) ) = (kg·m²/s²) which is J. So the units are correct.

So numerically, 1.112e-68 divided by 1.2075e-46:

1.112 /1.2075 ≈ 0.921. Then exponent: 1e-68 /1e-46 = 1e-22. So total is 0.921e-22 = 9.21e-23 J. That's correct.

Then p = E/c = 9.21e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 = (9.21/3)*1e-31 = 3.07e-31 N·s. But the options given are on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28. So this is way too small. That suggests that maybe I messed up the rotational energy calculation. Alternatively, maybe the transition isn't rotational but vibrational?

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the rotational transition. Let me check the vibrational energy difference instead.

Vibrational energy levels are given by the harmonic oscillator model: E_v = (v + 1/2) hν

---------------

, where ν is the vibrational frequency. The angular frequency w is given as 4e14 rad/s, so the frequency ν = w/(2π).

The energy difference between v=0 and v=1 would be hν. Because E_1 - E_0 = [(1 + 1/2) - (0 +1/2)] hν = hν.

So ΔE_vib = hν.

Let

---------------

 me compute that:

h is Planck's constant, 6.62607015e-34 J·s.

ν = w/(2π) = (4e14 rad/s)/(2π) ≈ (4 / 6.283) e14 ≈ 0.6366e14 Hz ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

Thus hν = 6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 ≈ let's compute:

6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 = 6.626 *6.366e-21 ≈ 42.14

---------------

e-21 = 4.214e-20 J.

So the energy difference for vibrational transition is about 4.21e-20 J, which is much larger than the rotational difference (9e-23 J). Since the question asks for the next state with the lowest possible energy, the rotational transition is the correct one. But why the discrepancy in the answer?

Wait, but the calculated momentum for rotational transition is 3e-31 N·s, but the options are in

---------------

 1e-27 to 1e-28. That's four orders of magnitude difference. So perhaps I made a mistake in the rotational energy calculation?

Alternatively, perhaps I confused

---------------

 the energy difference. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula for the rotational energy difference.

Wait, the energy levels for a rigid rotor are E_J = (ħ²/(2I)) J(J+1). The difference between J=1 and J=0 is:

E_1 - E_0 = (ħ²/(2I))(1*(1+1) - 0) = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/I. Wait that's correct. So that part is right.

Hmm, maybe the question is not about rotational transition but vibrational? But then the energy would be much higher, but the question says "next state with the lowest possible energy". So rotational is lower. But

---------------

 why such a big discrepancy?

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the moment of inertia?

Wait let me check the calculation again:

μ = (20 * 2)/(20+2) = 40/22 = 1.818 amu. That

---------------

's correct.

1.818 amu in kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 = 3.018e-27 kg. R is 2e-10 m. R squared is 4e-20 m². So I = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg·m². That's correct.

Then ΔE_rot = (1.05457e-34)^2 / 1.207e-46.

Let me compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = (1.05457)^2 * (1e-34)^2 = approx 1.112 * 1e-68 = 1.112e-68.

Divide by 1.207e-46: 1.112 /1.207 ≈ 0.921, so 0.921e-22 → 9.21e-23 J. So that's correct.

p = E/c → 9.21e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 N·s. But options are like 1e-27, so that's four orders of magnitude less. Hmm. There

---------------

 must be a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the formula for the rotational energy difference?

Wait, let me check the formula again. The energy levels are E_J = (ħ²/(2I)) J(J+1). So the difference between J=1 and J=0 is:

E_1 - E_0 = (ħ²/(2I))(1*2 - 0) = (ħ²/(2I))*2 = ħ²/I. So that's correct. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering a transition in the vibrational level instead. Let me see what the momentum would be in that case.

The vibrational energy difference is hν ≈ 4.21e-20 J. Then the momentum would be 4.21e-20 / 3e8 ≈ 1.4e-28 N·s. Which is option D.

Wait, that matches option D. But why?

Hmm, but the question says "next state with the lowest possible energy". The vibrational transition requires much more energy. So why would that be the case?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the "fundamental state" refers to the lowest vibrational state (v=0) but could be in any rotational state? Wait, the fundamental state is typically the ground state, which is v=0 and J=0. So the next state with the lowest energy would be the first excited state, which is the lowest possible energy state above the ground. Since rotational transitions are lower in energy than vibrational, the next

---------------

 state would be J=1, v=0. But according to the calculation, that gives a momentum of 3e-31, which isn't an option. The options given are much

---------------

 higher. So maybe the question is referring to a vibrational transition?

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the units of angular frequency. Let me check the given angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. For vibrational frequency, the angular frequency is ω = 2πν. So the vibrational energy difference is ħω. Because in the harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are (v + ½)ħω. So the difference between v=0 and v=1 is ħω. So that's (

---------------

1.05457e-34 J·s)(4e14 rad/s) = 4.218e-20 J. Which matches the previous calculation. Then the momentum p = E/c = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 ≈ 1.406e-28 N·s. Which is option D.

Ah! Wait, perhaps I was wrong in assuming it's a rotational transition. Maybe the question is actually asking for the vibrational transition. Because the problem mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, but perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition? Let me read the question again:

"If the molecule is in its fundamental state, what momentum should an absorbed photon have, in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy?"

The fundamental state is the ground state (v=0, J=0). The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the first excited state. The first excited state can be either v=1 (vibrational) or J=1 (rotational). Since rotational transitions are lower in energy, the photon

---------------

's energy should correspond to the rotational transition. However, the calculation for rotational gives an answer not in the options, but the vibrational gives option D, which is one of the options. Since the options are given, perhaps the question expects the vibrational transition?

Wait, but why would that be? Let me see the options again.

Options:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C) 1.1e-27

D) 1.4e-28

Hmm, so option D is ~1.4e-28, which matches the vibrational calculation. But that would be the vibrational transition. But why would the question say

---------------

 "next state with the lowest possible energy"? Because the rotational transition requires less energy. Unless I made a mistake in the rotational calculation.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula for rotational energy. Let me check again.

Wait, another thought: the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy". Maybe it's the next vibrational state, but the first excited rotational state is actually not possible because of selection rules? For rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. So from J=0 to J=1 is allowed. So that should be possible. So why the discrepancy?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the momentum of the photon in the vibr

---------------

ational transition. Because maybe the "fundamental state" here refers to the vibrational ground state, and the question is asking for the first vibrational excitation, even though that's higher energy. But the wording says "next state with the lowest possible energy". That should be the lowest energy state above the ground state, which is rotational.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy difference.

Let me re-calculate the rotational energy difference step by step again.

Given:

μ = (20 * 2)/(20 +2 ) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

R = 2 angstrom = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg·m².

ΔE_rot = (ħ²)/(I) 

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s

So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 = (1.0545718)^2 * 1e-68 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J²·s²).

Divide by I: 1.112e-68 / 1.207e-46 ≈ (1.112 /1.207)*1e-22 ≈ 0.921 * 1e-22 = 9.21e-23 J.

Then p = E / c = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 N·s. 

Hmm, that's way too small. The options given are orders

---------------

 of magnitude larger. So this must be wrong. Where is the mistake?

Wait a second, perhaps the question is referring to the vibrational transition's momentum. Let's see:

The vibrational energy difference is ΔE_vib = hν = h*(ω/(2π)) = (hω)/(2π) = (6.626e-34 *4e14 )/(2π). 

Wait, wait, h

---------------

ν = (h ω)/(2π) because ν = ω/(2π).

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier here. Let me recalculate the vibrational energy difference properly.

The vibrational energy levels are E_v = (v + 1/2)ħω. The difference between v=1 and v=0 is ħω. 

Ah! Oh

---------------

 right! The difference between v=1 and v=0 is (1+1/2 - (0 +1/2))ħω = ħω. 

So ΔE_vib = ħω. 

Wait, that's different from my previous calculation. Previously I had used hν, which is equal to ħω. Because hν = ħω. So yes, same thing.

So Δ

---------------

E_vib = ħω = 1.05457e-34 J·s * 4e14 rad/s = 4.218e-20 J.

Then p = E/c = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 ≈ 1.406e-28 N·s, which is option D. 

Ah! So perhaps

---------------

 I confused the rotational and vibrational transitions. But why?

The question says "next state with the lowest possible energy". Since rotational requires less energy, why would the answer be the vibrational?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the selection rules for rotational transitions. For a rigid rotor, the transition from J=0 to J=1 is allowed, yes. But perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, there's some other consideration?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering

---------------

 the rotational and vibrational transitions together, but the question specifies "the next state with the lowest possible energy". The lowest energy state above the ground is the first rotational state (J=1, v=0), but that requires an energy of ~9e-23 J, which gives a momentum of ~3e-31, which is not an option. The only option close is D (1.4e-28) which corresponds to the vibrational transition. 

Hmm, so

---------------

 maybe the question has a mistake, or perhaps I misunderstood the model.

Wait, looking back at the question: it says "quantum rotation-vibration model (or non-rigid rotor model)". Maybe the non-rigid rotor's

---------------

 rotational energy levels are different? 

Wait, the non-rigid rotor typically refers to a rotor that can vibrate, so the moment of inertia may vary, but for the lowest energy transitions, the rigid rotor approximation is still valid. Unless the question is implying that the rotational energy is coupled with the vibrational, but for the first excited state, it's still the rotational transition. 

Alternatively, maybe I made an error in calculating the rotational momentum. Let me recalculate the momentum for the rotational case again, but

---------------

 perhaps in another way.

The rotational energy difference is ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I).

p_rot = ΔE_rot / c = (ħ²)/(I c).

Plugging in the numbers:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s

I = 1.2075e-46 kg·m²

c = 3e8 m/s

So:

p_rot = ( (1.05457e-34)^2 ) / (1.2075e-46 * 3e8 )

Let me compute denominator first: 1.2075e-46 *3e8 = 3.6225e-38.

Numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = ~1.112e-68.

Thus p_rot = 1.112e-68 / 3.6225e-38 ≈ (1.112 / 3.6225) * 1e-30 ≈ 0.307 * 1e-30 = 3.07e-31 N·s. Still the same result. So that's too small.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D: 1.4e-28, which is three orders of magnitude larger. So unless I made a mistake in the units

---------------

 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the momentum in the vibrational transition. Then the answer would be D. But why?

Maybe the question is ph

---------------

rased in a way that the "next state with the lowest possible energy" actually refers to the lowest energy state that is accessible

---------------

 via a photon, which requires the photon to have the energy of the vibrational transition, perhaps because the rotational transition is forbidden? But rotational transitions are allowed with

---------------

 ΔJ=±1. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the vibrational and rotational together, and the lowest energy excited state that is accessible via a photon involves

---------------

 a vibrational transition. For example, if the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0), then the first excited vibrational state (v=1, J=0) would require a photon of energy hν, but maybe

---------------

 the rotational transition requires simultaneous change in J. Wait, no. A pure rotational transition would have Δv=0. But the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy". So the lowest possible energy is the rotational transition. But the options don't have that value. 

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the reduced

---------------

 mass calculation. Let me check that again.

Reduced mass μ = (M_x * M_y)/(M_x + M_y). The masses are given in amu: X is 20 amu, Y is 2 amu.

So μ = (20 * 2)/(20 +2) = 40/22 ≈1.818 amu. Correct. 

Converting to kg: 1.818 amu * 1.66e-27 kg/amu ≈ 3.018e-27 kg. Correct.

Bond length R is 2 angstrom = 2e-10 m. Correct.

Moment of inertia I = μ R² = 3.018e-27 * (2e-10)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg·m². Correct.

Hmm. 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the momentum of the molecule's rotation, not the photon's momentum? No, the question says "momentum should an absorbed photon have".

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the vibr

---------------

ational momentum. Wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy". If the question is referring

---------------

 to the next vibrational state, then the answer is D. But why would that be the case? Maybe the question has a typo and says

---------------

 "next vibrational state"?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for rotational energy. Let me check another source formula.

The rigid rotor energy levels are indeed E_J = (ħ^2/(2I)) J(J+1). The difference between J=1 and J=0 is:

E_1 - E_0 = (ħ²/(2I))*(1*2 - 0) = (ħ²/(2I))*2 = ħ²/I. So that's correct.

Hmm. Given

---------------

 that the options don't include the rotational result, perhaps I need to consider that the question is referring to the vibrational transition. Maybe the question says "fundamental state" which is the ground vibrational state, and the next state is first excited vibrational, even though it has higher energy than rotational transitions. But that contradicts the wording of "lowest possible energy".

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in

---------------

 units of angular frequency. The angular frequency given is 4e14 rad/s. Let's check what that corresponds to in terms of energy.

The energy difference for vibrational is ΔE = ħω = 1.05e-34 *4e14 = 4.2e-20 J. Which is what I had before.

Photon

---------------

 momentum p = 4.2e-20 / 3e8 ≈1.4e-28 N·s. That's option D. 

Given

---------------

 that the options include D, and the rotational calculation gives an answer not listed, perhaps the question intended the vibrational transition. Maybe I misunderstood the question's wording. Let me read again:

"what momentum should an absorbed photon have, in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy?"

The "next state with the lowest possible energy" would be the first excited state, which is the lowest energy state above the ground. That would be the rotational transition. But since that's not an option, perhaps the question is referring to the next vibrational state. Or maybe the question is asking

---------------

 for the vibrational transition's momentum, and I made a mistake in the rotational calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring

---------------

 to the momentum of the molecule's rotational motion, but that seems unlikely. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula for momentum. The momentum of a photon is p = E/c, yes. 

Hmm, since the calculated rotational momentum is not present in the options, but the vibrational is, and the options include D (1.4e-28), which matches the vibrational calculation, I think the intended answer is D. Perhaps there was a mistake in the question's phrasing, or I misread the question. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the quantum

---------------

 rotation-vibration model where the rotational and vibrational energies are coupled, but for the lowest energy transition, it might be a combined transition. But that's more complex. The first excited state would still be the rotational or

---------------

 vibrational. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the momentum of the molecule's center of mass? No, that doesn't make sense. 

Given the options and calculations, I think the intended answer is D, corresponding to the vibrational transition. Perhaps the question assumes

---------------

 that the fundamental state is the vibrational ground state, and they want the first vibrational excitation's photon momentum. Maybe the wording "next state with the lowest possible energy" is intended to mean the first excited state in the vibrational mode, which is the next fundamental state? Not sure, but given the options, D seems the only possible.


The problem involves a diatomic molecule transitioning from its fundamental state (ground state, v=0 and J=0) to the next lowest energy state upon absorbing a photon. The options provided suggest the answer relates to the vibrational transition rather than rotational due to the calculated rotational momentum not matching the given choices.

**Key Steps:**

1. **Identify the Energy Transition:**
   - The fundamental state is the ground vibrational (v=0) and rotational (J=0) state.
   - The next lowest energy state is typically a rotational transition (J=1), but its calculated momentum is not among the options. Instead, the vibrational transition (v=1) matches

---------------

 an option.

2. **Vibrational Energy Difference:**
   - Vibrational energy levels are given by \( E_v = (v + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\omega \).
   - The energy difference between \( v=1 \) and \( v=0 \) is \( \Delta E = \hbar\omega \).
   - Given \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \), calculate:
     \[
     \Delta E = \hbar \omega = (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}) \times (4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}) = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
     \]

3. **Photon Momentum Calculation:**
   - Photon momentum \( p = \frac{\Delta E}{c} \):
     \[
     p = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}}{3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}} \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}.
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The calculated momentum matches option D, which corresponds to the vibrational transition. The rotational transition's momentum is not listed, suggesting the question expects the vibrational result despite rotational transitions typically having lower energy.
