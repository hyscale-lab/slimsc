Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which conclusion about the genes' interactions is correct based on the experiment results. Hmm. The question involves three

---------------

 genes G1, G2, G3. The mutants are g1, g2, g3 and the double mutants. The key here is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. 

The results given are the resistance percentages for each mutant combination. Let me list them again:

- g1: 75%
- g2: 0%
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

The control is 100% resistance. So the wild-type has full resistance. The mutants have lower resistance, which suggests that the missing genes contribute to resistance. 

First, I need to understand what each term in the options means. The question mentions transcription factors, epistasis, pleiotropy, and redundancy. Let's recall definitions:

- Transcription factor: a gene that regulates other genes by binding to DNA and controlling their expression. If a gene is a transcription factor, knocking it out might affect multiple downstream genes, leading to a bigger effect than just the gene itself.
- Epistasis: when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. For example, if G2 is epistatic to G1, then the effect of G1 is masked unless G2 is present. Or maybe the other way around. Wait, the direction matters. Let me think. Epistasis usually means that the effect of one gene is dependent on another. So if G2 is epistatic over G1, then the expression of G1's effect requires G2. So if G2 is knocked out, then G1's effect can't be expressed. But

---------------

 I might have that backwards. Alternatively, sometimes it's phrased as "A is epistatic to B" meaning that A's gene product is necessary for B's function. So if you knock out A, then B can't function, so the phenotype of B's mutation would be hidden. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the epistatic interaction. Let's see examples.

Pleiotropy: when a single gene affects multiple phenotypic traits. But here, maybe the question is saying that the genes have multiple functions (pleiotropy) but in

---------------

 terms of their interactions in the pathway?

Gene redundancy: when two genes have overlapping functions. So if one is knocked out, the other can compensate. But if both are knocked out, you get a more severe phenotype.

Looking at the data. Let's see:

First, the single mutants:

g2 has 0% resistance. That's the worst. So when

---------------

 G2 is knocked out, the plant can't resist the fungus at all. 

g1 is 75% resistance

---------------

. So losing G1 reduces resistance but not completely. 

g3 is 50%, so it's intermediate between g1 and g2. 

Now the double mutants:

g1g2: 0%, same as g2. So combining g1 and g2 doesn't make it worse than g2 alone. So the presence of g1 doesn't change the outcome when g2 is already missing. 

g1g3: 10%, which is worse than both g1 (75%) and g3 (50%). So combining them makes it worse. 

g2g3: 0%, same as g2. So adding g3 to g2 doesn't change it.

Hmm. Let's think about possible relationships. 

First, since g2 alone is 0%, maybe G2 is a critical gene. The double mutants with g2 (g1g2 and g2g3) both are 0%, same as g2. So that suggests that G2 is epistatic over the other genes. Because when G2 is knocked out, the other genes (G1 and G3) can't contribute anything. So the effect of G1 and G3 is only possible if G2 is present. 

Wait, if G2 is a transcription factor, then maybe it's regulating the expression of G1 and/or G3. Let's see. 

If G2 is a transcription factor, then knocking it out would prevent the expression of other

---------------

 genes. So if G1 and G3 are downstream of G2, then their products would not be made in the absence of G2. But in that case, the single mutants g1 and g3 would have lower resistance than the wild type, but the double mutants with g2 would also be 0. 

Wait, but in the case of g1, the resistance is 75%. So if G2 is a transcription factor, maybe G2 is required for the expression of G1 and G3. But if G1 is knocked out, even if G2 is present, then G1's product is missing. So in the wild type, G2 would be producing

---------------

 the necessary signals to activate G1 and G3. 

Alternatively, perhaps the pathway is such that G2 is required for G1 and G3 to function. So if G2 is missing, then G1 and G3 can't do their job even if they're present. 

Looking

---------------

 at the single mutants:

g2 (0%): Without G2, no resistance. 

g1 (75%): So without

---------------

 G1, resistance is reduced but not completely. That suggests that G1 is part of a pathway that contributes to resistance, but there are other factors (like G2 and G3) that can compensate. 

g3 (50%): So without G3, resistance is halved. 

Now the double mutants:

g1g2: 0%, same as g2. So when

---------------

 both G1 and G2 are missing, the resistance is same as when only G2 is missing. So G1's absence doesn't add to the problem beyond what G2's absence already does. That suggests that G1's function is dependent on G2. 

Similarly, g2g3: same as g2. So G3's absence in addition to G2 doesn't make it worse, so G3's function is also dependent on G2. 

g

---------------

1g3: 10%. That's worse than either single mutant (75% and 50%). So when both G1 and G3 are missing, the resistance is much lower. That suggests that G1 and G3 are partially

---------------

 redundant. Because when both are missing, their combined absence leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone. 

So that points towards G1 and G3 being redundant (so they can compensate each other's absence to some extent). 

Putting this together:

G2 is essential (since its knockout gives 0% resistance). The other genes (G1 and G3) contribute to resistance but are not essential when

---------------

 G2 is present. 

G2's presence is required for G1 and G3 to function. Because when G2 is knocked out, even if G1 and G3 are present (as in the double mutants with G2 and another), the resistance is 0. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. 

Wait, but the options mention which gene is epistatic towards which. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option D says: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. 

Wait, but if G1 and G3 are redundant, then their combined knockout would have a worse effect. Which matches the g1g3's

---------------

 10%, which is worse than each alone. 

Also, G2 being a transcription factor would mean that it's upstream, regulating the expression of G1 and/or G3. 

So if G2 is a transcription factor, then without G2 (g2), both G1 and G3 are not expressed, so their absence (in the double mutants) doesn't matter because they're already not expressed. 

Wait, but in that case, the single mutant g1 would still have G2 present, so G3 could be active. But in

---------------

 g1, the resistance is 75%, which is better than g3 (50%). So maybe G1 and G3 have different contributions. 

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is required for both G1 and G3 to function. For example, G2's product is a transcription factor that turns on both G1 and G3. So when G2 is knocked out, both G1 and G3 are not expressed. Therefore

---------------

, their individual knockouts (g1 or g3) still have the other gene active, but in the double knockout with G2, they can't help. 

Wait, but in the case of g1 (knockout of G1), G3 is still present. So if G2 is present, then G3 should still be active. So in g1, the resistance is 75%, which is better than g3's 50%. That suggests that G1 contributes more than G3. 

Alternatively, perhaps G2's product activates G1, and G1 activates G3, but that might complicate things. 

Alternatively, G2 is a transcription factor that directly activates G1 and G3. So when G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed. Therefore

---------------

, in g2, both are not present, hence 0%. 

In g1, G2 is present, so G3 is still expressed. So the resistance is reduced by losing G1 but still has G3. Since g1 is 75%, that's better than g3's 50%. So G1's contribution is greater than G3's. 

Similarly, in g3, G1 is still present (since only G3 is knocked out), so resistance is 50%. 

So

---------------

 the combined effect of knocking out G1 and G3 (g1g3) would mean both are missing. Since their functions are redundant, the loss of both leads to a much lower resistance. 

So G1 and G3 are redundant. 

Now, looking at the options again. 

Option D says: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. 

Wait, the question states that at least one is a transcription factor upstream of others. So G2 being a transcription factor fits. 

Gene redundancy between G1 and G3 is supported by their combined knockout having worse effect. 

Now, what about epistasis? The options mention G1 is epistatic towards G3 (in D). Epistatic means that the effect of one gene is dependent on another. 

Alternatively, if G1 and G3 are redundant, maybe their relationship isn't epistatic but rather they are parallel. 

Epistasis usually occurs when the effect of one gene is hidden by another. For example, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then when G1 is knocked out, the effect of G3's knockout would not be seen. But in the case of g1g3, the resistance is even lower than either single mutant. That suggests that they are additive or redundant, not epistatic. 

So maybe the epistasis part in the options is a distractor. Let me check the options again. 

Looking at the options again:

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But in the case of g1g3, their combined effect is worse. That contradicts epistasis, because epistasis would mean that one masks the other. 

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. 

Alternatively, maybe the epistatic relationship is between G2 and the others. 

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But

---------------

 perhaps the correct answer is D because G1 and G3 are redundant, and G2 is the transcription factor. 

Alternatively, looking at option D's ph

---------------

rasing: "G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3".

Wait, but if G1 and G3 are redundant, their functions can substitute each other. So the

---------------

 loss of both would lead to a more severe phenotype. That's redundancy. 

But what about the epistasis? If G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean that the effect of G3 is dependent on G1. So if you knock out G1, then G3 can't function. But in the case of g3 (knocking out G3), the resistance is 50%, which is better than g1g3 (10%). So if G1 is epistatic over G3, then when you knock out G3, the effect should be masked

---------------

 unless G1 is also knocked out. But that's not the case here. 

Hmm. Maybe I need to think differently. 

Alternatively, perhaps the epistasis is between G2 and G1. Since when you knock out G2, the presence of G1 doesn't matter. So G2 is epistatic to G1. But the options don't have that. 

Looking at the options again:

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic to G3.

Pleiotropy is when a gene has multiple effects. But the question's

---------------

 options mention "show pleiotropy" for G1 and G3. Not sure if that's relevant here. 

Option D says redundancy between G1 and G3. 

The key points are:

- G2's knockout is the most severe (0%)
- The double mutants with G2 and any other also 0%: so G2 is required for any resistance. 
- G1 and G3 are partially

---------------

 redundant because their combined knockout is worse than either alone. 

Therefore, the correct answer would be D if that's the case. 

Option

---------------

 D says "G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3".

Wait, but the epistasis part might be incorrect. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, maybe the epistasis is not between G1 and G3, but G2 is epistatic to both. 

But the options don't have that. Let me see the options again. 

Looking at the options:

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 is epistatic to G3. 

If

---------------

 G1 is epistatic to G3, then the effect of G3 is dependent on G1. So, if you have a g1 mutant, then G3 can't function. But in reality, the g1 mutant has 75% resistance. If

---------------

 G3 is still functional in g1, then that would allow some resistance. 

Wait, in g1, G3 is present (since only G1 is knocked out). If G3's function requires G1 (because G1 is epistatic), then in g1, G3 can't work. That would mean that the g1's resistance would be as bad as g3g1. Wait, but the g1 is 75%, which is better than g3 (50%). That's conflicting. 

Hmm, so maybe the epistasis is the other way. If G3 is epistatic to G1, then the presence of G3 is needed for G1 to function. But then in the g3 mutant, G1 is present but can't function, so resistance would be worse than g1. But g3 is 50%, which is worse than g1's 75%. That makes sense. So if G3 is epistatic to G1, then when G3 is knocked out, G1 can't function. But in that case, the g3 mutant would have the same as g1g3 (since G1 is also not functioning). Wait, but g3 is 50% and g1g3 is 10%. So that doesn't fit. 

Alternatively, perhaps the epistatic relationship is not between G1 and G3 but between G2 and them. Since G2 is required for both to work. 

The question states that at least one is upstream (a transcription factor). So G2 being the TF is likely. 

So the correct

---------------

 answer would be D if the redundancy is correct and the epistasis part is a red herring or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the options might

---------------

 have the right combination. Let me check again:

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3, but according

---------------

 to the data, when you have both knocked out, the resistance is worse. That suggests they are redundant, not epistatic. So the epistatic part in D might be wrong. 

Hmm, perhaps the answer is D but the epistasis is not between G1 and G3 but G2. 

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me check the other options.

Option B says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter. Not sure if that's relevant. 

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic to G3. 

Pleiotropy is different from redundancy. Pleiotropy is one gene affecting multiple traits, but here the genes themselves are different

---------------

. 

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 pleiotropy, G2 epistatic to G1. 

But since G2's knockout gives 0%, which is worse than G1's, so G1 can't be the TF because knocking out G2 is more severe. So A is probably wrong. 

So the best options are between D and C. 

Wait, the

---------------

 key is that G1 and G3 are redundant. That's in D and C. 

In D, the epistasis is G1 on G3. But maybe

---------------

 the question's data doesn't support that. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D because the other parts are correct. Let me think again. 

The redundancy

---------------

 between G1 and G3 is definitely supported by the double mutant (g1g3) having lower resistance than either single. So that's redundancy. 

G2 is the transcription factor, so that's correct. 

Now the epistasis part. The question says "G1 is epistatic towards G3". 

Epistasis would

---------------

 mean that the effect of G3 is dependent on G1. So if G1 is knocked out, then the effect of G3's presence doesn't matter. 

In the g1 mutant, the resistance is 75%. If G1 is epistatic to G3, then in g1, G3 can't function, so the resistance would be as if both G1 and G3 are missing. But in reality, g1 is 75% which is better than g1g3 (10%). So that's not the case. 

Alternatively, if G3 is epistatic to G1, then in g3, G1 can't function. So the resistance would be as if both are missing. But g3 is 50%, which is better than g1g3 (10%). So that also doesn't fit. 

Hmm, perhaps the epistasis is not between G1 and G3, but the question requires choosing from the options. 

The options don't have an option that says G2 is epistatic over G1 and G3. So maybe the epistasis part in D is just a distractor but the first two parts are correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the question's options have D as the correct answer because it's the only one that mentions redundancy between G1 and G3 and G2 as a TF. The epistasis part might be a trick, but maybe the redundancy is the main point. 

Alternatively, perhaps the epistasis is between G2 and the others. For

---------------

 example, G2 is epistatic over G1 and G3, meaning that if G2 is knocked out, the other genes don't matter. That's supported by the data. But the options don't have that. 

Looking again at the options:

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. Since

---------------

 the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single, that suggests they are not epistatic but redundant. So maybe the epistasis is not correct

---------------

 here, but the question's options might have the best fit. 

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D because the other parts are correct, and the epistasis part is a mistake in the options, but I

---------------

 have to choose from them. 

Alternatively, maybe the term "epistatic towards" is being used differently. Maybe G1 being epistatic to G3 means that G1's effect is dependent on G3. Wait, no, that's the reverse. 

Alternatively, maybe the question's options are using "epistatic towards" as the direction where the epistatic gene is the one that's upstream. For example, if G2 is the TF, then G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. But that's not in the options. 

Hmm. Let

---------------

 me think of another approach. 

Since when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0, and adding any other mutation doesn't make it worse. So G2 is essential. 

Now, the single mutants:

g1 (75%) has G2 present, so G2 is active. Since

---------------

 G1 is knocked out, but G3 is present. The resistance is 75%, which is better than g3 (50%). So maybe G1 contributes more than G3. 

g3 (50%) has G2 and G1 present, so G1 is active. But losing

---------------

 G3 reduces resistance by half. 

The double mutant g1g3 (10%) is much worse, so their

---------------

 combined absence is worse than each alone. 

This suggests that G1 and G3 have overlapping functions, so they are redundant. 

Therefore, the correct option should have G2 as a TF, and G1 and G3 redundant. 

Looking at the options, that's D and C. 

Now, the difference between D and C is:

C: G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic to G3.

D: G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic to G3.

Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits, but here, the question is about interaction between genes. So redundancy is more likely. 

So D is better. 

The epistasis part in D is tricky. But maybe the question's answer is D, assuming that the epistasis is not directly

---------------

 contradicted. 

Alternatively, perhaps the epistasis is not required. Maybe the question's options have D as the correct answer because it's the only one with G2 as TF and redundancy. 

Therefore, I think the answer is D.


The experiment results indicate that the absence of G2 (g2 mutant) completely abolishes resistance (0%), suggesting G2 is essential. The double mutants involving g2 (g1g2, g2g3) also show 0% resistance, implying G2's function is epistatic over G1 and G3. G1 and G3 individually reduce resistance but not completely (75% and 50%, respectively), and their combined knockout (g1g3) results in 10% resistance, indicating redundancy between G1 and G3. G2 being a transcription factor aligns with its essential role. Among the options, **D** correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor, redundancy between G1 and G3, and the epistatic relationship (though the epistasis claim

---------------

 may be less critical given redundancy's stronger support).
