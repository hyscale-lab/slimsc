Okay, let's tackle this physics problem. Hmm, so the question is about nuclear fission and the kinetic energy of the fragments. Let

---------------

 me read it again carefully.

Alright, the nucleus at rest with mass M splits into two fragments. One is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. We need to find the difference between the actual kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment and the classical approximation.

First, I remember that in such f

---------------

ission processes, conservation of momentum applies because the initial momentum is zero. So the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Also

---------------

, since the rest mass of the fragments is less than the original mass, there's some energy released, which becomes their kinetic energy.

Let me denote

---------------

 the masses of the two fragments. Let the smaller mass be m, so the larger is 2m. Their total rest mass is m + 2m = 3m. The

---------------

 problem states this sum is 99% of M, so 3m = 0.99 M → m = (0.99/3) M.

---------------

 So M = 3m / 0.99 ≈ 3.0303m. But maybe I need

---------------

 to keep it symbolic for now.

First, let's consider conservation of momentum. Since the nucleus was initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So

---------------

 the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let the velocities be v1 for the larger fragment (mass 2m) and v2 for the smaller (mass m). Then 2m * v1 = -m * v2. So 2v1 = -v2. So

---------------

 v2 = -2v1. So their speeds are in a ratio of 2:1 but opposite directions.

Now, the

---------------

 kinetic energy part. The total kinetic energy comes from the mass defect. The initial rest mass energy is M * c². The final rest mass energy is (3m)c². The difference is the energy released, which becomes

---------------

 kinetic energy. The total kinetic energy is (M - 3m)c². Wait, since the sum of rest masses is 0.99 M, so M

---------------

 - 0.99M = 0.01 M is the mass difference. So total kinetic energy is 0.01 M c².

But since

---------------

 the question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (the 2m one), we need to find how that is

---------------

 divided between the two fragments.

In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². Since momentum is 

---------------

2m v1 = m v2, so v2 = 2 v1. Then, KE of the larger fragment is (1/2)(2m)v1² = m v1². The smaller fragment

---------------

's KE is (1/2)(m)(2v1)^2 = 2m v1². So the ratio of their KEs is 1:2. Total

---------------

 KE is 3 m v1² = 0.01 M c². 

Therefore, the classical T1 (KE of the larger fragment) would be (1/3 of

---------------

 total KE) → (0.01 M c²)/3. 

But wait, the problem says to compare with

---------------

 the actual T1. So the actual calculation must use relativistic equations?

Hmm, but maybe the question is expecting us to compute

---------------

 the relativistic vs. classical difference. Wait, but the rest mass energies are given as 300 GeV.

---------------

 Wait, the rest mass energy of the initial nucleus is 300 GeV. So M c² = 300 GeV. Then

---------------

 the mass defect is 1% of that, so total KE is 0.01 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV. 



---------------

So total KE is 3 GeV. 

In the classical case, the larger fragment has 1/3 of the total KE,

---------------

 so T1_classical = 1 GeV. 

But in reality, we need to use relativistic momentum and energy.

---------------

 Let me think about that.

Since the nucleus is at rest, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let me

---------------

 denote the momentum of the larger fragment as p. Then the smaller fragment has momentum -p (since total momentum is zero). 

The kinetic energy of

---------------

 each fragment can be found using the relativistic equations. The total energy of each fragment is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). The

---------------

 kinetic energy is total energy minus rest mass energy.

Let me denote:

For the larger fragment (mass 2m):

Total energy: E1 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (2 m c^2)^2 )

Kinetic energy T1 = E1 - 2 m c².

For the smaller fragment (mass m):

E2 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 )

T2 = E2 - m c².

The total kinetic energy is T1 + T2 = 3 GeV (since 

---------------

0.01*M c² = 3 GeV).

We need to solve for T1 (the actual value) and compare it to the classical 

---------------

1 GeV. The difference between T1 and T1_classical (1 GeV) is the answer.

Hmm, so

---------------

 how do we find T1 here?

Let me set variables. Let me denote variables in terms of variables.

Let’s let

---------------

 p be the magnitude of the momentum of the larger fragment (so the smaller has momentum p as well, in the opposite direction). 



---------------

We can write:

E1 + E2 = (Total energy after fission) = (sum of rest masses)*c² + total

---------------

 kinetic energy. Wait, actually, the total energy of the system is the sum of the rest masses plus the kinetic energies?

---------------

 Or is it the sum of the total energies (each including rest mass)?

Wait, the total energy of the system is the sum of E1 and E2. The

---------------

 initial energy was M c². The final energy is E1 + E2 = (2m + m)c² + (T1 + T2) = 3m c² + 3 GeV. But

---------------

 since 3m is 0.99 M, so 3m c² = 0.99 M c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So

---------------

 E1 + E2 = 297 + 3 = 300 GeV. Which matches the initial energy (

---------------

since the nucleus was at rest, so initial energy was M c²). So that checks out.

But we can also write

---------------

 E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

But E1 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (2 m c²)^2 )

E2 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2 )

So

---------------

 the equation is:

sqrt( (p c)^2 + (2 m c²)^2 ) + sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2 ) = 300 GeV

We

---------------

 also know that the total kinetic energy T1 + T2 = 3 GeV, so:

[sqrt( (p c)^2 + (2 m c²)^2 ) - 2 m c²] + [sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2 ) - m c²] = 3 GeV

S

---------------

implify that:

[sqrt( (p c)^2 + (2 m c²)^2 ) + sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2 ) ] - 3 m c² = 3 GeV

But from

---------------

 the first equation, the first bracketed term is 300 GeV. So 300 GeV - 3 m c² = 3 GeV → 3 m c² = 300 - 3 = 297 GeV. Which matches

---------------

 the earlier calculation (since 3m c² is 0.99 * 300 = 297 GeV). So that's consistent. So

---------------

 that doesn't help us.

Hmm, so perhaps we need to find p. Let's try to set variables in terms of variables

---------------

.

Let me denote:

Let’s let x = p c. Let’s denote the rest mass energies of the fragments as:



---------------

For the larger fragment, rest mass energy is 2 m c². Let me compute 2m c². Since 3m c² is 297 GeV, so 2m c² = (2/3)(297) = 198 GeV. Similarly, m c² is 99 GeV.

So 

---------------

2m c² = 198 GeV, m c² = 99 GeV.

So substituting into

---------------

 the equations:

E1 = sqrt(x² + (198)^2 )

E2 = sqrt(x² + (99)^2 )

And

---------------

 E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

So we have sqrt(x² + 198²) + sqrt(x² + 99²) = 300.

We

---------------

 need to solve for x. Let me denote the terms:

Let’s call A = sqrt(x² + 198²),

---------------

 B = sqrt(x² + 99²). Then A + B = 300.

Hmm, this equation

---------------

 might be tricky to solve algebraically, so perhaps we can square both sides. Let me try that.

Let me write (

---------------

A + B)^2 = 300^2 = 90000.

Expanding the left side: A² + 2AB + B² = 90000.

But A² = x² + (198)^2, B² = x² + (99)^2. So A

---------------

² + B² = 2x² + 198² + 99².

Thus,

2x² + (198² + 99²) + 2AB = 90000.

So

---------------

 2AB = 90000 - [2x² + (198² + 99²)]

Hmm, this

---------------

 seems complicated. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, let me subtract the equations. Wait, perhaps we can let’s subtract the two

---------------

 equations for E1 and E2. Let me think.

Alternatively, let me define variables to make the numbers manageable.

Let’s let

---------------

’s compute 198 squared and 99 squared. Let me compute those:

198^2 = (200-2)^2 = 40000 - 800 +4 = 39204.



---------------

99^2 = (100-1)^2 = 10000 - 200 +1 = 9801.

So A

---------------

² = x² + 39204,

B² = x² + 9801.

So

---------------

 A + B = 300.

Let me call A = 300 - B. Substitute into the equation for

---------------

 A²:

(300 - B)^2 = x² + 39204.

Expanding:

---------------

 90000 - 600 B + B² = x² + 39204.

But B² = x² + 9801,

---------------

 so substitute that:

90000 -600 B + (x² + 9801) = x² + 39204.

Simplify:

---------------

 90000 +9801 -600 B + x² = x² + 39204.

Cancel x²:

90000 +9801 -600 B = 39204.

So

---------------

 99801 - 600 B = 39204.

Subtract 39204 from both sides: 99801 -39204 = 600 B.

Compute

---------------

 99801 -39204: Let's see, 99801 - 39000 = 60801, then subtract 204 more: 60801 - 204 = 60597.

Thus 60597 = 600 B → B = 60597 / 600 = 100.995 Ge

---------------

V.

Hmm, so B ≈ 101 GeV. Then since B is sqrt(x² + 9801), so

---------------

:

B² = (101)^2 ≈ 10201 (since 100^2 is 10000, 101^2 is 10201). Wait

---------------

, but 100.995 squared is (101 - 0.005)^2 ≈ 101² - 2*101*0.005 + (0.005)^2 ≈ 10201 - 1.01 + 0.000025 ≈ 10200.

---------------

 So approximately 10200.

Wait, let's do exact calculation:

B = 60597 / 600 = 60597 divided by 600.

---------------

 Let me compute that:

600 × 100 = 60,000. 60597 - 60,000 = 597. 597/600 = 0.995. So yes

---------------

, 100.995.

So B squared is (100.995)^2. Let's compute that

---------------

 exactly:

(100 + 0.995)^2 = 100² + 2*100*0.995 + (0.995)^2 = 10000 + 199 + 0.990025 = 10199.990025 ≈ 10200.



---------------

So B² ≈ 10200.

But B² = x² + 9801 → x² = B² - 9801 ≈ 10200 - 9801 = 399.

So

---------------

 x ≈ sqrt(399) ≈ 19.975 ≈ 20 GeV/c (

---------------

since x is p c, so the momentum p is x/c, so units here are in GeV/c? Wait, actually

---------------

, in the equations above, the units are in GeV. Wait, perhaps I need to check units again.

Wait, in

---------------

 the equation for E1, which is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (2m c²)^2 ), so pc

---------------

 has units of energy. Because (pc)^2 is (GeV)^2. Because p is momentum (in GeV/c,

---------------

 since c is in units where c=1 in some systems?), maybe. Let me see. Let me clarify units here.

Actually

---------------

, in natural units where c=1, but here, since we're dealing with energies in GeV, and the rest mass energies are given in GeV, so

---------------

 the momentum pc would have units of GeV. Because m c² is in GeV, so m (mass) is (GeV)/c². Then

---------------

 pc has units of (GeV/c) * c = GeV. So yes, pc is in GeV. So the

---------------

 variables here are in GeV. So x is pc in GeV.

Therefore, x ≈ sqrt(399) ≈ 19.975 GeV.

---------------

 So approximately 20 GeV.

So the momentum p is about 20 GeV/c.

Now, let's compute the kinetic energy T1 of the larger fragment.

E

---------------

1 = sqrt(x² + (2m c²)^2) = sqrt( (20)^2 + (198)^2 ). Wait, wait

---------------

, x was sqrt(399) ≈ 19.975, so x squared is ~399. So

---------------

 399 + (198)^2 = 399 + 39204 = 39603. The

---------------

 square root of that is sqrt(39603). Let me compute that:

sqrt(39603) �

---------------

� 199.005 GeV. Because 200 squared is 40,000, so 199 squared is (200-1)^2 = 40,000 - 400 +1 = 39601. So sqrt(39603) is sqrt

---------------

(39601 +2) ≈ 199 + (2)/(2*199) ≈ 199.005 GeV.

Thus E1 ≈ 199.005 GeV. The rest mass energy of the larger fragment is 2m c² = 198 GeV. Therefore, T1 = E1 - 2m c² ≈ 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV.

Hmm

---------------

, so the actual kinetic energy is approximately 1.005 GeV.

Wait, but the classical calculation gave T1 = 1 GeV (since total

---------------

 KE is 3 GeV, with the ratio 1:2). So the difference between actual T1 (1.005 GeV) and classical (1 GeV) is 0.005 GeV. But

---------------

 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV). Wait

---------------

, that would be 0.005 * 1000 = 5 MeV. So the difference is 5 MeV. So

---------------

 the answer would be B?

Wait, but let me check again.

Wait, the actual T1 is 1.005 GeV,

---------------

 which is 1005 MeV. The classical is 1 GeV = 1000 MeV. The difference is 5 MeV. So that

---------------

's option B.

Hmm, but let me check my steps again because I might have made an approximation.

Wait, when I calculated

---------------

 x squared as 399, but let me check:

We had B = 100.995 GeV.

---------------

 Then B squared is (100.995)^2 = 100.995*100.995. Let me compute that

---------------

 precisely.

100.995 × 100.995 = (100 + 0.995)^2 = 100² + 2×100×0.995 + (0.995)^2 = 10,000 + 199 + 0.990025 = 10,199.990025.



---------------

So B squared is exactly 10,199.990025. 

Then x squared = B squared minus (m c^2)^2 =

---------------

 10,199.990025 - (99)^2 = 10,199.990025 - 9801 = 10,199.990025 - 9801 = 398.990025.

---------------

 So x ≈ sqrt(398.990025) ≈ 19.9747 GeV.



---------------

Then E1 squared is x squared + (2m c²)^2. 2m c² is 198, so squared is 198² = 39204. So

---------------

 E1 squared is 398.990025 + 39204 = 39602.990025. The

---------------

 square root of that is sqrt(39602.990025). Since 199 squared is 39601, so sqrt(39602.99) is 

---------------

199 + (1.99)/(2*199). Let's compute 39602.99 - 39601 = 1.99. So the

---------------

 sqrt is approximately 199 + 1.99/(2*199) ≈ 199 + 0.005 �

---------------

� 199.005 GeV. So yes, that's correct.

Thus T1 is 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV.

---------------

 So difference from classical is 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV. So the answer is B)

---------------

 5 MeV.

Wait, but let me check the classical approach again. The total kinetic energy is 3 GeV. The masses

---------------

 are in ratio 2:1. So in classical, the kinetic energies are in ratio (mass * v²) for

---------------

 each. But since momentum is p = m v, so p1 = 2m v1 and p2 = m v2. Since

---------------

 p1 = -p2, then 2m v1 = -m v2 → v2 = -2 v1. So

---------------

 the velocities are in ratio 2:1 (opposite directions). 

Thus the kinetic energy for the larger fragment (2m) is (1/2)(2m)v1² = m v1². The smaller is

---------------

 (1/2)(m)(2v1)^2 = 2 m v1². So total KE is 3 m v1² = 3 GeV. So

---------------

 m v1² = 1 GeV. Thus the classical T1 is exactly 1 GeV. So the actual is 1.005 GeV. The difference is 0.005 GeV =

---------------

 5 MeV. So yes, the answer is B.

Hmm, but why is the actual T1 higher than the classical? Because relativistic effects give

---------------

 a bit more kinetic energy? Or because the assumption that KE is (pc)^2/(2m) isn't exact?

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps I made an error in calculation. Let me see again. The actual calculation gives T1 as 1.005 GeV, which

---------------

 is 5 MeV more than 1 GeV. Wait, no, 1.005 -1 = 0.005 GeV,

---------------

 which is 5 MeV. So the difference is 5 MeV, so the correct answer is B. That seems

---------------

 right.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is asking for the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1. So if

---------------

 the actual is higher, then the difference is (actual - classical) = 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV, so the

---------------

 answer is B. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of T1. Let me check E1 again. 



---------------

E1 = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (2m c^2)^2 )

pc is x = ~19.975 GeV.



---------------

So (pc)^2 is approx (20)^2 = 400, but exact was 398.99.

---------------

 

2m c² is 198, so (2m c²)^2 is 198² = 39204. 

Adding

---------------

 them gives 398.99 + 39204 = 39602.99. The

---------------

 square root is indeed ~199.005. So yes, T1 is 1.005 GeV. 

Therefore

---------------

, the difference is 5 MeV. So option B is correct.


To solve the problem, we start by noting that the nucleus at rest splits into two fragments with masses in a 2:1 ratio. The total rest mass of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass, leading

---------------

 to a mass defect of 1% of the initial rest mass energy. The initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV, so the total kinetic energy (KE) released is 3 GeV.

**Conservation of Momentum**: The fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the larger

---------------

 fragment (mass \(2m\)) have momentum \(p\), and the smaller fragment (mass \(m\)) have momentum \(-p\). 

**Classical Calculation

---------------

**: In classical mechanics, KE is proportional to mass times velocity squared. The velocities are inversely proportional to mass (since momentum is conserved). The KE ratio is

---------------

 \(1:2\), so the larger fragment has \(1/3\) of the total KE:  
\[ T_{1,\text{classical}} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3\ \text{GeV} = 1\ \text{GeV} \]

**Relativistic Calculation**: Using relativistic energy-momentum relations:  
-

---------------

 Rest mass energies:  
  \(2m c^2 = 198\ \text{GeV}\) (larger fragment),  
  \(m c^2 = 99\ \text{GeV}\) (smaller fragment).  
- Let \(x = pc\). The total energy conservation

---------------

 gives:  
  \[ \sqrt{x^2 + (198)^2} + \sqrt{x^2 + (99)^2} = 300\ \text{GeV} \]  
Solving this yields

---------------

 \(x \approx 20\ \text{GeV}\). Substituting back:  
- KE of the larger fragment:  
  \[ T_1 = \sqrt{(20)^2 + (198)^2} - 198 = 1.005\ \text{GeV} \]  

**Difference**: The relativ

---------------

istic KE (\(1.005\ \text{GeV}\)) minus the classical (\(1\ \text{GeV}\)) gives:  
\[ 0.005\ \text{GeV} = 5\ \text{MeV} \]

Answer: B) 5 MeV.

\boxed{B}<|im_end|>
