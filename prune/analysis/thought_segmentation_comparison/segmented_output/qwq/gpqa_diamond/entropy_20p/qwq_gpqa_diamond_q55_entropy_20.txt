Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom transitions. The question is about the decay from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The options give possible routes and probabilities. Hmm, I need to recall

---------------

 the selection rules for dipole transitions.

First, the dipole transition selection rules in hydrogen. The main ones are that the change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number l must be ±1. Also, the magnetic quantum number m must change by 0 or ±1. Wait

---------------

, but for electric dipole transitions specifically, the Δl has to be ±1, and Δm can be 0 or ±1. Also

---------------

, the principal quantum number n can change by any amount as long as the other rules are satisfied, but the question mentions two dipole transitions, so the

---------------

 path must involve two steps.

The initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. Since

---------------

 the transitions are dipole allowed, each step must satisfy Δl = ±1. Let's see the possible paths.

First, from

---------------

 |3,0,0⟩, the first transition must go to a state where l changes by ±1. Since original

---------------

 l is 0, the next l can be 1 (since 0+1=1, or 0-1 is

---------------

 negative which isn't allowed here). So the first transition must go to l=1. The possible intermediate states would have l=1 and m

---------------

 can be 0±0, ±1. But the m has to change by 0, +1, or -1. So

---------------

 from m=0, the next m can be 0, +1, or -1. So possible intermediate states after

---------------

 the first transition are |n',1,m⟩ where m is 0,1,-1.

The next transition from there must go to the final state |

---------------

1,0,0⟩. So from the intermediate state, the next transition must have Δl again ±1. Since

---------------

 the final l is 0, the intermediate l must be 1 (so that Δl is -1 for the second transition). So

---------------

 the intermediate must have l=1. 

So the first step must go to a state with l=1. The n

---------------

 for the intermediate state can be anything as long as the transitions are allowed. Let's look at the possible steps.

Possible paths:



---------------

First transition from 3,0,0 to some |n1,1,m1⟩, then to |1,0,0⟩. The

---------------

 second transition must have Δl = -1 (since going from l=1 to l=0). So the second transition is allowed.

---------------

 

The options given are A, B, C, D. Let's check each.

Option A: 3→2,1,0 →1,0,0. The

---------------

 first transition is 3,0,0 to 2,1,0. Then from 2,1,0 to 1,0,0. Let's check the

---------------

 selection rules for each step.

First step: Δn= -1 (from 3 to 2), Δl= +1 (0→1),

---------------

 Δm=0. That's okay. Second transition: n goes from 2 to 1 (Δn=-1), Δl from

---------------

 1 to 0 (Δl=-1), Δm from 0 to 0 (so Δm=0). So

---------------

 both steps satisfy the Δl=±1 and Δm 0 or ±1. So that's allowed.

Option B: 3→2,1,1 →1,0,0. First transition:

---------------

 Δl from 0→1 (okay), Δm from 0→1 (allowed). Second transition: l=

---------------

1→0 (okay), m goes from 1→0 (Δm -1, which is allowed). So that

---------------

 path is also allowed. But the probability is given as 1/4 here.

Option C: similar to B but m=-

---------------

1. The first transition would have m going from 0 to -1 (allowed), then m from -1 to 0 (allowed). So that path is also allowed. The

---------------

 probability here is 1/4 as well.

Option D: The path seems similar to A but the first transition is written as |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→

---------------

|1,0,0⟩, but the probability is 2/3. Wait, but the options might have a typo?

---------------

 Let me check the options again. The user input shows option D as starting with a missing |3,0,0⟩? Wait

---------------

 the user wrote: D) \rangle\rightarrow|2,1,0\rangle\rightarrow|1,0,0\rangle and 2/3. Hmm

---------------

, maybe that's a typo and they meant the same as A but with a different probability. So probably D is same path as A but with different probability. 



---------------

Now, the question is which path is correct and what's the probability. The problem states that it decays via two dipole transitions. So

---------------

 the possible paths are A, B, C, or D. 

The key is to figure out the possible intermediate states and the

---------------

 probabilities. The question also says "the transition route and the corresponding probability". 

In hydrogen transitions, the probability of a transition is

---------------

 proportional to the square of the transition matrix element, but the question might be referring to the number of possible allowed paths and their probabilities.

---------------

 Alternatively, maybe the probabilities given are the branching ratios or the sum over possible m values. 

Wait, perhaps the question is about

---------------

 the possible paths and which one is correct. Let me think again. The initial state is l=0, so to go

---------------

 to l=1 in the first step. The first transition can have m changing by 0, +1, or -1. So

---------------

 from m=0, possible m values in the intermediate state are m=0, 1, -1. So there

---------------

 are three possible intermediate states for the first transition (since l=1 can have m=-1,0,1). However

---------------

, the second transition must go to m=0. 

So for each of those intermediate states, the second transition must have

---------------

 Δm from the intermediate m to 0. 

So for the first transition:

Case 1: intermediate is |2,1,0⟩. Then the

---------------

 second transition must go from m=0 to m=0, which is allowed (Δm=0). So this is one

---------------

 possible path (A).

Case 2: intermediate is |2,1,1⟩. The second transition must have Δm from

---------------

 1 to 0 (Δm=-1), which is allowed. So that's path B.

Case 3: intermediate is |2,1,-1⟩. Second

---------------

 transition must have Δm from -1 to 0 (Δm +1), allowed. That's path C.

Thus

---------------

 there are three possible paths, each with different m values. However, the options list A, B, C as different possibilities

---------------

 with different probabilities. 

The question says "the transition route and the corresponding probability". Since the problem is asking for the correct

---------------

 answer, perhaps only one of these is correct. The probabilities in the options vary between 1/3, 1/4, and 2/3. 

Hmm

---------------

, perhaps the probability is the sum over all possible paths, but each path's probability is weighted by the possible m components. Alternatively

---------------

, the probability for each path might depend on the angular momentum selection rules and the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. 

Alternatively, the

---------------

 question might be referring to the fact that when there are multiple possible paths, the total probability is split among them. For instance, if

---------------

 there are three possible paths (A, B, C), each with equal probability, then each would have probability 1/3. But

---------------

 the options for A have 1/3, which would make sense. But options B and C have 1/4, which doesn

---------------

't add up. 

Alternatively, maybe the intermediate n can also be different? Wait, in the first step from n=3 to n

---------------

=2, but maybe the first transition could go to n=1? Let's see. Wait, the first transition must

---------------

 go via dipole, so from n=3 to any n', but then the second transition must go to n=1. Let

---------------

 me see. 

Wait, the first transition could go to n=2 (as in the options) or perhaps n=4

---------------

? But since the final is n=1, the second transition must decrease n. Let me see. Suppose first step is

---------------

 from 3,0,0 to n'=4, l=1, m=... but then the second step would have to go from n'=4 down to n=1, but that's

---------------

 possible but perhaps less likely. However, in the options given, the intermediate is n=2. So probably the question expects

---------------

 the path through n=2 first. 

Alternatively, maybe the possible paths are only those with n decreasing each time. Because

---------------

 when emitting a photon, the energy must decrease. Since the energy of the H atom is -13.6 eV /n². So going

---------------

 from n=3 (lower energy than n=2?) Wait, no, n=3 is higher energy than n=2.

---------------

 So transitions can go to lower n. So the first step from 3 can go to n=2 or n=1.

---------------

 Wait but the final is n=1. If first step went from 3 to 1, then the second step would have to go from 1 to something

---------------

, which can't. So first transition must go to n=2 (since n can't jump directly to 1 in

---------------

 a dipole transition? Wait, let's check the first transition from n=3 to n=1. The Δn can be any except

---------------

 0, but the Δl must be ±1. So from l=0 to l=1, so that's okay. Then

---------------

, can the first step be 3→1, l=1? But in that case, the second transition would have

---------------

 to go from l=1 to l=0, which is allowed. But the options don't have that path. So

---------------

 perhaps the question assumes that the two transitions are via intermediate states with n=2. 

So assuming that the path is through n=2,

---------------

 then there are three possible paths (A, B, C). The probabilities for each would depend on the angular momentum factors. The selection

---------------

 rules for dipole transitions also involve the parity. Since the parity of a state is (-1)^l. So the initial

---------------

 state (l=0) has parity +1. The intermediate must have l=1 (parity -1), so that

---------------

 the parity changes, which is necessary for dipole transition. Similarly, the final state (l=0) has parity +1 again, so the

---------------

 second transition from l=1 (parity -1) to l=0 (parity +1) is okay. So parity is okay for

---------------

 all steps. 

Now, the probability for each transition would depend on the matrix elements. But maybe the question is simpler. Since

---------------

 there are three possible m paths (m=0, ±1), each path would have an equal probability? If so, then each of

---------------

 A, B, C would have probability 1/3. But in the options, A says 1/3, B

---------------

 and C say 1/4, so that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the m=0 path is different?

---------------

 

Alternatively, the total probability is split among the possible m transitions. For the first transition from |3,0,0⟩, the possible m for

---------------

 the intermediate are 0,1,-1. The probability for each of these m values would depend on the matrix elements. But

---------------

 in the electric dipole approximation, the transition rate is proportional to the square of the matrix element ⟨final|m e r Y

---------------

_l m|initial⟩. 

The matrix element for the dipole transition between states depends on the angular parts. The integral

---------------

 involves the product of the initial and final spherical harmonics. 

The first transition is from l=0 to l'=1. The angular

---------------

 part of the dipole transition operator is proportional to Y_{1,m'}, so the matrix element would be proportional to the integral over Y

---------------

_{1,m'} (from final) times Y_{0,0} (initial). The integral of Y_{1,m'} Y

---------------

_{0,0} over the sphere is zero unless certain conditions. Wait, the integral of Y_{l'm'} Y_{l m} is proportional

---------------

 to delta_{ll'}, delta_{mm'}, but here the initial l is 0, so integrating Y_{1,m'} *

---------------

 Y_{0,0} would be zero unless l'=1 and l=0, but the integral would be zero except

---------------

 when... Wait, maybe I should think in terms of addition of angular momenta. 

Alternatively, the matrix element for the dipole transition between

---------------

 states with l and l' must satisfy |l' - 1| ≤ l ≤ l' +1. Wait, the

---------------

 dipole operator has angular momentum 1 (since it's a vector), so the transition must satisfy Δl = ±1. 



---------------

But the actual selection rules for the m values: the m' - m must equal the projection of the dipole operator's angular momentum.

---------------

 The dipole operator (proportional to r) has angular momentum 1, so the change in m is -1,0,+1. So

---------------

 the transition can have Δm = 0, ±1. 

Thus, the first transition from m=0 can go to m'=0, ±

---------------

1. Each of these is allowed. The probability for each m' is determined by the square of the matrix element. 



---------------

The matrix element for the transition from |n,l,m⟩ to |n', l', m'⟩ is proportional to:



---------------

⟨n', l', m' | r | n, l, m ⟩ 

The radial part depends on n and n', but the angular part is

---------------

 given by the integral involving the spherical harmonics. 

The angular part of the dipole transition matrix element between l=0 and l'=1,

---------------

 m'=0 is proportional to ⟨Y_{1,0} | Y_{0,0}⟩, but actually, the dip

---------------

ole operator's angular part is a vector, so the matrix element involves the components. 

Alternatively, the matrix element for the dipole transition is

---------------

 given by:

⟨n', l', m' | e r Y_{1,m''} | n, l, m ⟩ 

Wait, the

---------------

 dipole transition operator is proportional to the position vector r, which can be expressed in terms of spherical harmonics. The matrix

---------------

 element for the transition would involve the product of the initial and final wavefunctions. 

The exact calculation might be complex, but perhaps

---------------

 the probabilities for each m' are equal? If so, then the three possibilities (m'=0, ±1) would each have 

---------------

1/3 probability. So the path A (m'=0) would have probability 1/3, and paths B and C (m'=±1) would each have 1/3,

---------------

 but the options for B and C have 1/4. That doesn't fit. 

Alternatively, maybe when considering the second transition. Let's think

---------------

 of the total probability for each path. 

Take path A: first transition to |2,1,0⟩, then to |1,0,0⟩. 

The first step's

---------------

 probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element for 3→2,0→1,0→0. 

The second step from

---------------

 2,1,0 to 1,0,0 would have matrix element squared proportional to some value. 

Similarly

---------------

, for path B, the first step is to 2,1,1, then to 1,0,0. The second transition here

---------------

 would have m changing from 1 to 0, which requires Δm = -1, which is allowed. 

The probability

---------------

 for each path would depend on the product of the matrix elements for each step. 

The total probability would be the sum over all possible paths.

---------------

 But the question is asking for the transition route and the corresponding probability. So maybe each path's probability is 1/3,

---------------

 so answer A would have 1/3, which is option A. 

Alternatively, perhaps the m=0 path has a different probability because

---------------

 the angular part is different. 

The angular part for the first transition from m=0 to m'=0 would involve the

---------------

 integral of Y_{1,0} * Y_{0,0} (times some radial functions). Wait, the angular

---------------

 part of the dipole matrix element between l=0 and l'=1 with m'=0 would require that the integral of

---------------

 Y_{1,0} Y_{0,0} is non-zero? 

Wait, the dipole operator has components

---------------

 like r_x, r_y, r_z, which correspond to the spherical harmonics Y_{1, m} with m= -1,0,1. The

---------------

 transition matrix element for a particular m' would involve the integral of the product of the initial Y_{0,0}, the dip

---------------

ole component (which has Y_{1,m''}), and the final Y_{1,m'}. 

The integral over the angles

---------------

 would be proportional to the Wigner 3j symbol or something similar. 

Alternatively, perhaps the transition from m=0 to m'=0 requires

---------------

 that the dipole operator's m'' component is 0 (since m' - m = m'' for the operator). So

---------------

 for Δm=0, the operator must have m''=0. The Y_{1,0} corresponds to the z-component (

---------------

like r_z), so that would contribute. 

The transition to m'=1 would require Δm=+1, so the operator component

---------------

 would have m''=+1 (like Y_{1,1}), and similarly for -1. 

The matrix elements for each

---------------

 of these components may have different magnitudes. For example, the Y_{1,0} component (dipole z)

---------------

 might have a different integral than the Y_{1,±1} components (x and y). 

However, in the case where the initial and final states are spherically symmetric (like

---------------

 l=0), the integrals for the dipole transitions in different m directions might have the same magnitude. Because the initial state is spherically symmetric, the probability

---------------

 for each m direction should be the same. 

Therefore, the probabilities for each of the three possible m transitions (m'=0,1

---------------

,-1) would be equal. Since there are three possibilities, each would have a probability of 1/3. 



---------------

So path A (m'=0) would have a probability of 1/3, which matches option A. 

Paths

---------------

 B and C (m'=±1) each would also have 1/3, but the options list them as 1/4, which might

---------------

 not be correct. 

Alternatively, perhaps the second transition also has probabilities. Let's see. 

Take path A: after

---------------

 the first step to |2,1,0⟩, the second transition to |1,0,0⟩ requires Δl = -1 and Δm =0. The probability

---------------

 for this step would again depend on the matrix elements. 

Similarly, for path B, the first transition to |2,1,1⟩, then the

---------------

 second transition from m'=1 to 0 requires Δm = -1. 

The total probability for each path would be the product of the probabilities for each step. 

Ass

---------------

uming that each step's probabilities are the same (since the transitions are between similar states), then the total probabilities would be (

---------------

1/3) * (1/ something). Wait, this is getting complicated. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simpler

---------------

. Since the problem states "via two dipole transitions", and the options give possible paths with their probabilities, and the correct

---------------

 answer is the one that has the right path and the correct probability. 

The question might be expecting that the first transition from

---------------

 3→2 must have Δl=+1 (since from l=0 to l=1). Then the second transition from 2→1 must have Δl= -1 (from

---------------

 l=1 to l=0). So that's allowed. 

Now, considering the possible m values, the path with

---------------

 m=0 in the intermediate state would have a probability that's different than the others? 

Wait, perhaps the probability given

---------------

 in the options is the branching ratio. For example, the total probability for all possible paths would be 3*(probability of each path's

---------------

 first transition) * (probability of second transition). 

Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the fact that when you have multiple

---------------

 possible paths, the total probability is split between them. Since there are three possible paths (A, B, C), each with

---------------

 the same probability, then each would have 1/3, so the correct answer would be option A, which has 1/3. 

Looking

---------------

 at the options, option A says the probability is 1/3, which matches this reasoning. 

Options B and C have 1/4, which would

---------------

 not add up to 1 if there are three paths. 3*(1/3)=1, but if each had

---------------

 1/4, that would be 3/4. So perhaps the question considers only two paths? Wait, no

---------------

. 

Alternatively, maybe there are more paths. For instance, the intermediate n could be higher? Like n=4?

---------------

 But the question specifies two dipole transitions, so going from 3→4 would require an increase in n, which would need

---------------

 absorption of a photon, but the problem states decay, so it must emit photons. So n must decrease each time. 

Thus

---------------

, the only possible intermediate n is 2. So three paths. 

Therefore, the correct answer is A. 

Wait

---------------

, but let me check the options again. Option D has the same path as A but with a probability of 2/3. But

---------------

 that would not fit the three paths. Unless there's another path. 

Alternatively, maybe the first transition can also go to n=1?

---------------

 Let me see. 

First transition from 3,0,0 to n=1, l=1, m=0.

---------------

 Then the second transition would be from n=1, l=1 to n=1, l=0? No, that

---------------

 can't happen because you can't have transitions within the same n? Wait, no, the second transition would have to go from n=1 to n

---------------

=0, which is impossible. So the first transition can't go to n=1. So only n=2 is possible. 

Therefore

---------------

, only three paths. So A's probability is 1/3, so the correct answer is A. 

Alternatively, maybe the probability

---------------

 is calculated considering the radial integrals, which might make some paths more probable. For example, the transition from n=3 to n=2 has

---------------

 a certain probability, then multiplied by the transition from n=2 to n=1. 

But without knowing the exact radial

---------------

 matrix elements, perhaps the question is expecting the selection rules and the fact that the m=0 path has a different probability.

---------------

 

Wait, another thought. The first transition from l=0 to l=1 must have a Δl=+1, so the

---------------

 angular part of the matrix element for the dipole transition is proportional to sqrt( (2l+1)(2l'+1) ) *

---------------

 something? 

Alternatively, the total probability for the two-step process would be the sum over all possible intermediate states of the product of the probabilities for each step. 



---------------

But since the question gives specific options, perhaps the answer is A. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the fact that the

---------------

 m=0 path is the only one possible? But that can't be since Δm can be 0, ±1. 

Hmm, I

---------------

 think the key is that the question says "the transition route and the corresponding probability". The path must be one of the options

---------------

, and the probability for that specific path. Since each path has 1/3 probability, option A's probability is correct. 

Thus

---------------

 the correct answer should be A.


The question involves the decay of the hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0⟩ state to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. Dip

---------------

ole transitions require Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. 

1. **First Transition**: Starting from |3,0,0⟩, the intermediate

---------------

 state must have l = 1 (since Δl = +1). The possible m values are 0, +1, or -1,

---------------

 leading to intermediate states |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩.


---------------

2. **Second Transition**: From the intermediate state, transitioning to |1,0,0⟩ requires Δl = -1 and Δm =

---------------

 0, ±1. All three intermediate states can transition to |1,0,0⟩ with allowed Δm changes:


---------------

   - |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ (Δm = 0),
   - |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ (Δm = -1),
   - |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ (Δm = +1).

The

---------------

 probabilities for each path depend on the angular components. Since the initial state is spherically symmetric (l = 0), the probabilities

---------------

 for transitions to m = 0, +1, or -1 are equal. Thus, each path has an equal probability of \( \frac{1}{3} \).

**

---------------

Option A** corresponds to the path |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability \( \frac{1}{3} \), which matches the reasoning. Other

---------------

 options either have incorrect probabilities (B and C: \( \frac{1}{4} \)) or formatting issues (D).

Answer: A<|im_end|>
