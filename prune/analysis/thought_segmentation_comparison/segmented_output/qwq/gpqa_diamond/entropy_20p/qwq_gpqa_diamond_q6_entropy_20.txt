Okay, so I need to figure out at what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes limited by annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The question gives the average CMB photon energy as 10^-3 eV. Hmm, right, this is

---------------

 about the pair production process where a high-energy gamma photon collides with a lower-energy photon (from the CMB here) and creates an electron-positron pair. 

First, I remember that for pair production to occur, the total energy of the two photons must be at least the rest mass energy of the electron and positron. Since each has a rest mass of about 0.511 MeV, the total required

---------------

 is 2*0.511 MeV, which is 1.022 MeV. But wait, this

---------------

 is in the center-of-mass frame, right? Because in pair production, the two photons have to have enough combined energy to create the pair

---------------

. 

So the process is γ (high energy) + γ (CMB) → e+ + e-. The threshold condition would

---------------

 be when their combined energy equals the rest mass energy of the two electrons. But since the photons are moving, their energies add

---------------

 up in the appropriate frame. Wait, actually, in pair production via two photons, the threshold condition requires that the sum of their energies in

---------------

 the center-of-mass frame is at least the rest mass energy. But how do I relate that to the lab frame here

---------------

?

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the threshold condition in terms of the energy of the gamma-ray. Let me recall the formula for the minimum energy required for pair

---------------

 production with a photon of energy ε (the CMB photon here). 

I think the formula for the minimum energy of the high

---------------

-energy photon (Eγ) needed to produce an electron-positron pair when colliding with a photon of energy ε is given by the

---------------

 threshold condition. The threshold occurs when the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is exactly the rest mass energy of the two electrons. 

The formula

---------------

 I might need here is Eγ * ε ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / (4 ε), but maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, the

---------------

 minimum energy Eγ needed for pair production with a photon of energy ε (in the same frame) is given by Eγ ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / (4 ε). Wait, that

---------------

 sounds familiar. Let me check the derivation. 

The pair production requires that the sum of the energies of the two photons (

---------------

in the center of mass frame) must be at least 2m_e c². But since photons have no rest mass, their energy is

---------------

 entirely kinetic. To get the threshold condition, we can set the total energy in the center of mass to exactly 2m_e c². 

Alternatively

---------------

, considering that in the lab frame, the CMB photon is at rest? Wait no, photons are always moving at c. Hmm

---------------

, maybe it's better to use relativistic equations here. 

The threshold condition for pair production via two photons is when their combined

---------------

 energy in the center of mass frame is at least the rest mass of the two electrons. The minimum energy occurs when the two

---------------

 photons are moving directly towards each other, so their momenta are opposite. The total energy in the center of mass frame would then be Eγ + ε (since they

---------------

 are moving in opposite directions, their momenta cancel in the center of mass frame). Wait, no, the center of mass frame's

---------------

 energy would be the sum of their energies in that frame. Wait, perhaps I need to compute the invariant quantity s = (p1 + p2)^2, which must be ≥

---------------

 (2m_e c²)^2. 

The invariant s for two photons is given by s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. But for photons, E = pc, so p

---------------

1 c = E1 and p2 c = E2. Thus, s = (Eγ + ε)^2 - (Eγ + ε)^2 =

---------------

 0? Wait that can't be right. Wait no, wait, the vectors. Wait, the photons are moving in opposite directions?

---------------

 

Wait, let me think again. The invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (p1 c

---------------

)^2 + (p2 c)^2 + 2 p1 p2 c^2 cosθ) )? Hmm

---------------

, maybe I need to consider their direction. Let me set up coordinates where one photon is moving along the positive z-axis and the other along the negative z-axis. Then their momenta are p

---------------

1 and -p2 (since direction matters). So the total momentum vector would be (p1 - p2) along the z-axis. 



---------------

The invariant s is (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2. 

E_total is Eγ + ε. 

p_total is (Eγ/c - ε/c),

---------------

 since one is in +z, the other in -z. So p_total c = Eγ - ε. 

Thus, s = (Eγ + ε)^2 - (Eγ - ε)^2. Let me compute that. 

Expanding (

---------------

a + b)^2 - (a - b)^2 = 4ab. So s = 4 Eγ ε. 

The

---------------

 threshold condition requires that s ≥ (2 m_e c²)^2. 

Therefore, 4 Eγ ε ≥ (2 m_e c²)^2. 

Dividing both sides by 4:

---------------

 Eγ ε ≥ (m_e c²)^2. 

Therefore, solving for Eγ gives Eγ ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / ε. 

Ah, that

---------------

's the formula! So the minimum energy required for the high-energy photon is (m_e c²)^2 divided by the energy of the other

---------------

 photon (the CMB photon here). 

So plugging in the numbers. 

The rest mass energy of the electron is m_e c² = 0.511 MeV. 



---------------

The CMB photon energy ε is 1e-3 eV. 

Wait, but units here: I need to make

---------------

 sure they are in the same units. Let me convert everything to eV. 

0.511 MeV is 0.511 *

---------------

 1e6 eV = 5.11e5 eV. 

So (m_e c²)^2 is (5.11e5 eV)^2. 

Div

---------------

ided by ε = 1e-3 eV. 

So Eγ ≥ (5.11e5)^2 / (1e-3) eV. 

Let me compute that. 

First, square

---------------

 5.11e5: (5.11)^2 = approx 26.11, so (5.11e5)^2 = 26.11e10 (since (5.11)^2 ×

---------------

 (1e5)^2 = 26.11 × 1e10). 

Wait, 5.11 squared is actually

---------------

 5.11*5.11. Let me calculate that more accurately. 5*5 is 25, 0.11*5 is

---------------

 0.55, so 5.11 squared is (5 + 0.11)^2 = 25 + 2*5*0.11 + 0.11² = 25 + 1.1 + 0.0121 = 26.1121. So yeah

---------------

, approximately 26.11. 

So (5.11e5 eV)^2 = 26.11e

---------------

10 eV². 

Divide that by ε = 1e-3 eV. 

So 26.11e10 / 1e-3 = 26.11e13 eV. 

So

---------------

 Eγ ≥ 26.11e13 eV. 

Now, converting eV to GeV. 

1 GeV = 1e9 eV. 

So 26.11e13 eV =

---------------

 26.11e13 / 1e9 = 26.11e4 GeV. 

Hmm

---------------

, so approximately 2.611e5 GeV. 

Looking at the options: 

A) 9.5e4 GeV 



---------------

B) 1.8e5 

C) 2.6e5 

D) 3.9e5 

So option

---------------

 C is 2.6e5 GeV, which is close to our calculation (26.11e4 is 2.611e5). 

Wait, but

---------------

 wait, let me check the calculation again. 

Wait, (0.511 MeV)^2/(1e-3 eV). Wait

---------------

, hold on. 

Wait, the formula is (m_e c²)^2 / ε. 

Wait, m_e c² is 0.511 MeV =

---------------

 511,000 eV. 

So (511,000 eV)^2 divided by (1e-3 eV) 



---------------

So numerator is (5.11e5)^2 = (5.11)^2 * 1e10 =

---------------

 26.1121e10 eV² 

Denominator is 1e-3 eV. 

So dividing

---------------

 gives (26.1121e10) / (1e-3) = 26.1121e13 eV 

Convert

---------------

 to GeV: 26.1121e13 eV / 1e9 eV/GeV = 26.1121e4 GeV =

---------------

 2.61121e5 GeV. 

So yes, that's exactly option C. 

Therefore

---------------

, the answer should be C. 

Wait, but the options have numbers like 2.6*1e5.

---------------

 The way it's written might be a typo? Let me check the options again. 

The options are written as:

A) 9.5*1e4 GeV → 95,000 GeV



---------------

B) 1.8*1e5 → 180,000

C) 2.6*1e5 → 260,000

D) 3.9*1e5 → 390,000

Yes

---------------

, so 2.6e5 matches exactly with our calculation. So the correct answer is C.


To determine the minimum energy of gamma-rays whose

---------------

 lifetimes are limited by annihilation with CMB photons, we use the threshold condition for pair production: $\gamma \gamma \rightarrow e^+ e^-$. The invariant energy

---------------

 squared, $s$, must be at least $(2m_e c^2)^2$. For two photons with energies $E_\gamma$ (high-energy gamma) and $\epsilon$ (CMB photon), the invariant is $s = 4 E_\gamma \epsilon$. Setting $s = (2m_e c^2)^2$ gives the threshold condition:

\[
4 E_\gamma \epsilon \geq (2 m_e c^2)^2 \implies E_\gamma \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{\epsilon}.
\]

Plugging in values: $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 5.11 \times 10^5 \, \text{eV}$ and $\epsilon = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$,

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{(5.11 \times 10^5 \, \text{eV})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = \frac{(26.11 \times 10^{10} \, \text{eV}^2)}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = 26.11 \times 10^{13} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Converting to GeV ($1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}$):

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{26.11 \times 10^{13} \, \text{eV}}{10^9 \, \text{eV/GeV}} = 2.611 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

This matches option C.
