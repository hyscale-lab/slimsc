Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the net potential energy of a system where a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. Hmm, the

---------------

 options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with potential

---------------

 energy in electrostatic systems, it's often about the work done to assemble the charges. But in this case, the sphere is grounded, which complicates things a bit. Since the sphere is grounded, it can have

---------------

 induced charges, right? The charge on the sphere will adjust such that the potential on its surface is zero because it's connected to ground.

Wait, maybe

---------------

 I should recall the method of images here. I think that's the standard approach for problems involving grounded conductors. The method of images replaces the conductor

---------------

 with an image charge so that the boundary conditions are satisfied. Let me try to remember how that works.

The grounded conducting sphere with

---------------

 radius R and a point charge q outside it. The image charge method would place an image charge q' at a position such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. The distance

---------------

 from the center to the image charge should be proportional. Let me see. 

The formula for the image charge in such a case

---------------

 is q' = - (R/d) * q. Wait, right, because the sphere is grounded, the total charge on the sphere is

---------------

 zero, but the induced charges create an image charge inside. The position of the image charge would be along the line connecting the center and the original charge. The distance from the center to the image charge is (R²)/d. Because

---------------

 the product of the distances of the original and image charges from the center is R squared. So the image charge is located at a distance of R²/d from the center, on

---------------

 the opposite side of the sphere's surface from the original charge?

Wait, let me get that straight. Suppose the original charge is at distance d from the center. The image charge q

---------------

' is placed at a distance of (R²)/d from the center, so that the ratio of distances is R²/(d *

---------------

 (R²/d)) = R²/(R²) = 1? Hmm, maybe I need to think again. The

---------------

 image charge is located along the line between the center and the original charge. Let me recall the formula: for a grounded sphere, the image charge is at

---------------

 a distance of (R²)/d from the center towards the center, so the distance between the original charge and the image charge would be d - (R²/d)

---------------

 = (d² - R²)/d. But the sign of the image charge would be negative. 

The potential on

---------------

 the surface of the sphere must be zero because it's grounded. The potential due to the original charge and the image charge should add up to zero at

---------------

 the surface. Let me verify that. 

The potential at the surface (radius R) due to the original charge q at distance d is (kq)/d (

---------------

wait, no, the distance from the charge to the surface point is variable. Wait, actually, the potential at any point on the surface must

---------------

 be zero. So the image charge must be arranged so that the sum of potentials from q and q' at every point on the sphere's surface is zero. 



---------------

Alternatively, the method gives the image charge as q' = - (R/d) q, placed at a distance R²/d from the center. So

---------------

 that the potential at the surface (radius R) due to both charges is zero. 

So, the system can be considered as two

---------------

 charges: the real charge q at distance d from the center, and an image charge q' at distance R²/d from the center,

---------------

 on the opposite side. The total potential energy of the system would then be the potential energy between these two charges. Wait, but since

---------------

 the sphere is grounded, does that affect the calculation?

Hmm, actually, the potential energy of the system would be the work done to assemble the charges. Since the sphere is grounded, the

---------------

 induced charges on the sphere are not fixed; the presence of the external charge induces a charge on the sphere, but the sphere

---------------

 can adjust its charge to maintain zero potential. However, when calculating the potential energy, perhaps we can consider the system as the original charge and the image charge. 



---------------

The potential energy between the two point charges would be U = k * (q * q') / r, where r is the distance between them. Let

---------------

's compute that. The distance between the original charge and the image charge is d + (R²/d), but wait, no

---------------

. Wait, the original charge is at distance d from the center, and the image charge is at R²/d from the center,

---------------

 but in the opposite direction. So the distance between them is d + (R²/d). Wait, no, if the original is at

---------------

 distance d from the center along some direction, the image is on the opposite side at distance R²/d from the center, so the separation between them is d + (R²/d). 



---------------

Wait, let me think again. Suppose the original charge is placed along the x-axis, at position x = d (assuming

---------------

 the center is at 0). The image charge would be at position x = - R²/d. The separation between them is d + R²/d. 



---------------

So the potential energy between them would be U = k * q * q' / (d + R²/d). 



---------------

But the image charge q' is equal to - (R q)/d. 

So substituting that in, we get:

U = k * q * (- R q /d ) / (d + R²/d )

Let me compute the

---------------

 denominator: d + R²/d = (d² + R²)/d. 

So substituting that:

U = k * (- R q² / d ) / ( (d² + R²)/d ) 

The d in the denominator cancels with the d in the numerator from

---------------

 the denominator's denominator. So:

U = -k R q² / (d² + R² )

Wait, but the

---------------

 question is asking for the net potential energy of the system. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let

---------------

's check again. 

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the work done to bring the charge q to its position, considering the induced charges. Since the sphere is grounded, the

---------------

 potential at the sphere's surface is zero. The potential at the location of the charge q would then be due to the image charge.

---------------

 Wait, maybe another approach is better. 

Alternatively, the potential energy of a charge in an external potential is U = q * V.

---------------

 But in this case, the charge q is creating its own potential, and the induced charges contribute as well. Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 the method of images gives an equivalent system of two charges, so the total potential energy is the energy between them. 

Wait, but

---------------

 in that case, the calculation I did earlier gives U = - (k q^2 R) / (d² + R²). But

---------------

 looking at the options, none of them exactly match that. Let me check the options again. 

The options are:

A) U= - (1/2) kq² d/(d² + R²)

B) U= -kq² d/(d² - R²)

C) U= - (1/2)kq² R²/(d² - R²)

D) U= - (1/2)*kq² R/(d² - R²)

Hmm, my result

---------------

 doesn't match any of these. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. 

Wait, the

---------------

 image charge's position is R²/d from the center, so the separation between the two charges is d + (R²/d). Let

---------------

 me compute that again. 

Wait, actually, the original charge is at distance d from the center, and the image is at R²/d from

---------------

 the center towards the opposite direction, so the distance between them is d + (R²/d). So that part is correct. 

The

---------------

 image charge is q' = - (R q)/d. 

So the potential energy between the two charges is (k*q*q') /

---------------

 separation. 

So substituting:

k * q * (-R q/d) / (d + R²/d )

Let

---------------

 me compute numerator and denominator again. 

Numerator: -k R q² /d 

Denominator: (d^2 + R^2)/d 

So dividing

---------------

 numerator by denominator gives:

- k R q² /d divided by (d² + R²)/d → the d's cancel, so -

---------------

k R q² / (d² + R² )

Hmm, so that's the potential energy between the two charges. But is

---------------

 that the total potential energy of the system? 

Wait a second, in the method of images, the system is considered as the original charge and the image charge, but the image

---------------

 charge is not a real charge. The real system is the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. The total potential energy should

---------------

 be the work done to assemble the system. 

Alternatively, the potential energy of the system can be thought of as the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the induced charges on the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, bringing

---------------

 the charge q to position d would induce a charge on the sphere, but the sphere's potential remains zero. 

Alternatively, the

---------------

 potential at the location of the charge q would be due to the induced charges on the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero, but the induced

---------------

 charges create a potential at the point where q is placed. The total potential at that point must be V = V_induced + (k q)/r, where r is the distance from q to itself?

---------------

 Wait, no, that's not right. 

Alternatively, using the method of images, the potential at the location of the charge q would

---------------

 be due to the image charge and the sphere's potential. Wait, the sphere's surface is at zero potential, but the potential

---------------

 inside must also be zero? Wait, no, the sphere's interior is a conductor, so the potential inside is the same as the surface. 



---------------

Hmm, perhaps another way: the potential energy is the work done in bringing the charge q to its position. Since the sphere is grounded, as

---------------

 we bring the charge q closer, the induced charges on the sphere will adjust, but the work done is against the field created

---------------

 by those induced charges. 

Alternatively, in the image charge approach, the system's potential energy is the energy between the original

---------------

 charge and the image charge. But since the image charge is not real, perhaps the actual potential energy is half of that? Wait, sometimes

---------------

 in potential energy calculations with images, you have to be careful because the image charge isn't a real charge. Wait, but

---------------

 in the method of images, the image charge is a mathematical construct to satisfy boundary conditions. So the actual system is the original

---------------

 charge and the induced charges on the sphere. 

The potential energy of the system would be the work done to bring the charge q to its position, considering

---------------

 the induced charges. The induced charges on the sphere can be considered as a distribution, but in the image method, it's equivalent to having a point charge q'. The

---------------

 total potential energy would then be the energy between the original charge and the induced charges, but since the induced charges are on the sphere, their

---------------

 contribution can be represented by the image charge. 

Alternatively, the total potential energy should be the same as the energy between the original charge and the image charge. But

---------------

 in that case, the result I got earlier would be U = -k R q²/(d² + R²). But

---------------

 this doesn't match any of the options except maybe option A, but with a factor of 1/2. Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I forgot to account for something. 

Wait, another thought: the potential energy of a system of charges is (1/2) times

---------------

 the sum of all pairs. In this case, if we have two charges, q and q', then the potential energy is (1/2)(

---------------

q*V_q' + q'*V_q). But since they are point charges, it's the same as (k q q')/r. Wait

---------------

, but maybe the image charge is considered part of the system, so the total energy would be (1/2) *

---------------

 (q * V_imposed_on_q + q' * V_imposed_on_q' ), but I might be mixing concepts here. 

Alternatively, the

---------------

 standard formula for potential energy between two charges is U = k q1 q2 / r. So if the image charge is part

---------------

 of the system, then that's the value. But in the method of images, perhaps the real system's potential energy is exactly

---------------

 that. 

Hmm, but let's see the answer options again. Let me think of another approach. 

Alternatively, the

---------------

 potential at the location of the charge q is the sum of the potential due to itself and the induced charges. But since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges adjust

---------------

 so that the potential on the sphere is zero. The potential at the position of q would be the potential due to the induced charges plus the potential due to q itself. Wait

---------------

, but the potential at that point must be considered. 

Wait, the potential energy of the system is the work done to assemble the charges. Let

---------------

's say we start with the sphere grounded, so initially, no charge. Then we bring the charge q from infinity to a

---------------

 point distance d from the center. As we bring q closer, the sphere becomes charged. The work done is the integral of the force

---------------

, which is equivalent to q times the potential at the point where it's placed, due to the induced charges. 

So

---------------

 the potential at the point where we place q is V = V_induced + (k q)/r, but r is the distance from q to itself, which would

---------------

 be problematic. Wait, perhaps the potential at the point where q is placed is just the potential due to the induced charges on

---------------

 the sphere. Because the potential due to q itself is not part of the potential from the rest of the system. 

Alternatively

---------------

, the total potential energy U is the work done to bring the charge q to its position in the presence of the sphere's induced charges. Since

---------------

 the sphere is grounded, the induced charges can adjust freely, so the potential on the sphere's surface remains zero. The potential at the point where q is placed is

---------------

 the potential due to the induced charges plus the potential due to q itself. Wait, but the induced charges are on the sphere, so their potential at the point where

---------------

 q is placed is V_induced = (k * Q_induced)/distance_from_sphere. 

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe going

---------------

 back to the method of images is better. 

In the method of images for a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge is placed

---------------

 inside the sphere at a distance of R²/d from the center, with charge q' = - (R q)/d. The potential energy of the system (

---------------

the original charge and the image) would be the potential energy between them, which is U = k q q' / (

---------------

distance between them). 

The distance between q and q' is d + (R²/d), so as before. 



---------------

So plugging in q' gives U = k * q * (-R q/d) / (d + R²/d )



---------------

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: -k R q² / d 

Denominator: (d² + R²)/d 

So dividing

---------------

 numerator by denominator gives: 

U = (-k R q² / d ) * (d / (d² + R²)) ) 

The d terms cancel, so U = -k R q² / (d² + R² )

But looking at the options, none of them have that

---------------

. The closest is option A, but it has a factor of 1/2 and a numerator of d instead of R. Hmm

---------------

, so perhaps I missed a factor here. 

Wait, maybe the potential energy should be half of that because in the formula

---------------

 for potential energy between two charges, you have U = (1/2) q1 q2 / (4πε0 r),

---------------

 but wait, no. Wait, the standard formula is U = (1/(4πε0)) * (q1 q2)/r. But

---------------

 if we use k = 1/(4πε0), then U = k q1 q2 / r. So that

---------------

 part is okay. 

Alternatively, perhaps the image charge method gives the correct potential energy, but in the system, the sphere

---------------

's induced charge also has energy. Wait, the image charge represents the effect of the induced charges on the sphere, so the

---------------

 total energy of the system is the same as the energy between the two point charges (original and image). So the calculation above

---------------

 should be correct. 

Hmm, but the answer isn't among the options. Let me check the options again. 

Option

---------------

 C is U = - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R²). 

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 I made a mistake in the sign or in the denominator. Let me think again. 

Wait, maybe the sphere isn't grounded in

---------------

 the same way. Wait, if the sphere is grounded, then the total charge on the sphere is zero. Wait, but

---------------

 in the method of images, the image charge is placed inside, and the total charge induced on the sphere is equal to the image charge?

---------------

 Or is it the other way around? 

Wait, the image charge q' is - (R/d) q. The total charge induced on the sphere would be equal to the image charge?

---------------

 Because the sphere is grounded, so the total induced charge would be equal to the image charge. Wait, maybe the sphere's induced charge is equal

---------------

 to -q', so that the total charge (induced plus image?) Hmm, perhaps I need to get back to the problem

---------------

. 

Alternatively, maybe the potential energy is not just between the two charges but also includes the energy of the induced charges. 



---------------

Alternatively, another approach: The potential energy of the system is the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to its position.

---------------

 

When bringing q from infinity to a point outside the sphere (assuming d > R?), the sphere being grounded allows charges to flow in or out to

---------------

 maintain zero potential. 

The potential at the location of q is the potential due to the sphere's induced charges plus the potential due to q itself. Wait

---------------

, but since the sphere is grounded, the potential on the sphere's surface is zero, but the potential at the point where q is placed is

---------------

 not necessarily zero. 

Wait, the work done to bring q to that point is q multiplied by the potential at that point due to the induced charges on

---------------

 the sphere before placing q there. Wait, but when you bring q, the induced charges are a result of q's presence, so maybe

---------------

 it's an integral over the process. 

Alternatively, using the method of images, the potential at the location of q is the

---------------

 sum of the potential due to the image charge and the potential due to the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, the potential on the sphere is zero, but

---------------

 the potential at the point where q is placed would be the potential from the image charge plus the potential from the sphere's surface

---------------

. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. 

Alternatively, let's recall that in the method of images, the potential

---------------

 energy of the system is the same as the potential energy of the original charge and the image charge. So if the image charge is q

---------------

', then U = k q q' / r. 

Earlier, I found that gives -k R q²/(d² + R²). But

---------------

 none of the options have that. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula for the image charge's position or charge

---------------

. Let me double-check the method of images for a grounded sphere. 

The standard problem is a grounded conducting sphere of radius R, and a point charge q at

---------------

 distance d from the center. The image charge q' is located at a distance a = R²/d from the center, on

---------------

 the line connecting the center and the original charge. The image charge is q' = - (R/d) q. 

Yes

---------------

, that's correct. 

Therefore, the distance between q and q' is d + a = d + R²/d = (d² + R²)/d. 

Therefore

---------------

, the potential energy between them is: 

U = k * q * q' / (distance between them) 

=

---------------

 k * q * (- R q /d) / [ (d² + R²)/d ]

Which simplifies to:

---------------

 

= -k R q² /d * d/(d² + R²) 

The d's cancel, so U

---------------

 = -k R q² / (d² + R² )

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them have that

---------------

. The options are: 

A) U = - (1/2) k q² d/(d² + R² )

B) -k q² d/(d² - R² )

C) - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R² )

D) - (1/2) k q² R/(d² - R² )

Wait

---------------

, perhaps I have a mistake in the sign? The problem states that the sphere is grounded. The image charge is negative.

---------------

 So the potential energy between them is negative? The options have negative signs, so that's okay. 

Hmm, perhaps the correct

---------------

 answer is option A but with an extra factor. Wait, maybe the potential energy is half of that. Why?

Wait, sometimes

---------------

 in potential energy calculations for systems with multiple charges, you have to consider that the energy is counted twice. For example, if

---------------

 you have two charges, the potential energy is (1/2) the sum of each charge times the potential from the others. 



---------------

Wait, in the case of two charges, the potential energy is indeed U = (k q1 q2)/r. But

---------------

 if you consider assembling them one by one, the work done is bringing the first charge (no work since nothing is there), then bringing the second charge from

---------------

 infinity to distance r, which requires work W = q2 * V1(r) = q2*(k q1 / r). So that's exactly

---------------

 k q1 q2 /r. 

Therefore, in this case, the potential energy between q and q' is exactly

---------------

 k q q' / r. So the previous calculation should be correct. 

Hmm, so unless there's a different approach

---------------

 here, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's setup. Let me check the options again. 

Wait, maybe the question

---------------

 is asking for the potential energy of the charge and the sphere? The sphere's induced charge would have its own energy. 



---------------

Wait, the total potential energy of the system would also include the energy stored in the induced charges on the sphere. But the

---------------

 sphere's charge is -q', since the total induced charge is equal and opposite to the image charge? Because the sphere is grounded, so the total charge on

---------------

 the sphere is the same as the image charge? 

Wait, the image charge q' is inside the sphere, so the induced

---------------

 charge on the sphere must be -q' to make the total charge on the sphere (since it's grounded) zero? Wait no, the

---------------

 sphere is grounded, so the total charge on the sphere can be anything, but the potential is kept at zero. 

Wait

---------------

, in the method of images for a grounded sphere, the total induced charge on the sphere is equal to the image charge. Because

---------------

 the sphere is grounded, the induced charge can flow to ground, so the sphere's total charge is equal to the image charge. Wait

---------------

, perhaps not. 

Alternatively, the image charge is placed inside the sphere, and the sphere's actual charge is equal to the image charge.

---------------

 Wait, I'm getting confused here. Maybe the sphere's total charge is equal to -q' because the image charge is inside

---------------

 the sphere, so the induced charge on the sphere's surface would be -q'. 

Wait, the total charge on the sphere is

---------------

 the sum of the induced charges. Since the sphere is grounded, the total charge can vary. The image charge method assumes that the induced

---------------

 charge on the sphere is such that the potential on the surface is zero, and the image charge is placed inside to model this. 

The

---------------

 total induced charge on the sphere would be equal to the image charge's value? Because when you have an image charge inside the sphere, the sphere

---------------

's surface charge would be such that the potential on the surface is zero, and the total charge on the sphere would be equal to the image charge's charge. 



---------------

Wait, perhaps the total charge on the sphere is Q = q', so that when you have the original charge q and the sphere's induced charge Q, the

---------------

 potential on the surface is zero. 

But the sphere is grounded, so the total charge on the sphere is actually zero? Wait

---------------

 no, because the sphere is grounded, the total charge can adjust to any value. The potential on the sphere is kept at zero,

---------------

 but the charge can be non-zero. 

Wait, perhaps I need to think of the sphere's induced charge as Q =

---------------

 - q' because the image charge is inside the sphere. 

Wait, let's think of the sphere as a conductor. The total

---------------

 charge on the sphere (induced) must be such that the potential on the surface is zero. The image charge method replaces

---------------

 the conductor with an image charge, so that the sphere's surface is an equipotential (zero) surface. The total

---------------

 induced charge on the sphere would be equal to the image charge. 

Wait, the image charge is located inside the sphere, so the total

---------------

 charge on the sphere would be -q' to make the total charge (image + sphere) zero? Not sure. 

Alternatively, the

---------------

 sphere's total charge is equal to the image charge. 

Hmm, regardless, perhaps I need to consider the potential energy of

---------------

 the system as the sum of the potential energy between the original charge and the induced charges, plus the energy of the induced charges themselves. 

But

---------------

 that's complicated. Alternatively, since the image charge represents the effect of the induced charges, the total potential energy of the system (original charge plus sphere) is the

---------------

 same as the potential energy between the original charge and the image charge. 

Because the sphere's charges are arranged such that they produce

---------------

 the same field as the image charge. 

Therefore, the potential energy should indeed be U = -k R q²/(d² + R² ).

---------------

 But none of the options match that. 

Wait, looking again at the options, option C is U = - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R² ). 



---------------

Hmm, maybe there's a different formula here. Let me consider if the sphere is not grounded but isolated. Wait, if

---------------

 the sphere were isolated and uncharged, then the potential energy would be different. But the question says grounded. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made

---------------

 a mistake in the sign of the image charge. Let me check that again. 

The image charge for a grounded sphere:

---------------

 when you have a point charge outside a grounded sphere, the image charge is inside the sphere, with charge - (R q)/d. So

---------------

 that's correct. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem states that the charge is placed at a distance d from the center, so

---------------

 the distance from the surface is (d - R). But that shouldn't affect the image charge formula. 

Hmm. Maybe

---------------

 I need to check another resource or formula. 

Alternatively, let me think of the potential energy of the charge q in the presence

---------------

 of the sphere. 

The potential at the location of q due to the induced charges on the sphere must be such that the total potential at

---------------

 that point is the sum of the potential due to the sphere and the potential due to the charge itself. Wait, but the

---------------

 sphere's potential is zero. 

Wait, the sphere is grounded, so its potential is zero. The potential at the point where the charge q is placed is the

---------------

 potential due to the sphere's induced charges plus the potential due to q itself. Wait, but the potential due to q itself is

---------------

 (k q)/0 (since it's at the point), which is infinity. That can't be right. 

Alternatively

---------------

, the potential at the point where q is placed is the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere plus the potential due to the

---------------

 other charges (the image charge?), but perhaps this is getting too confused. 

Alternatively, let me think of the potential energy as the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to its position. 



---------------

The work done would be q multiplied by the potential at that point due to the sphere's induced charges before placing q there. 



---------------

Wait, but when you bring q near the sphere, the induced charges are a result of q's presence. So the work

---------------

 done is actually the integral from infinity to the final position of q times the potential due to the induced charges, which depend on the position of q. 

This requires

---------------

 calculus. 

Alternatively, the potential energy can be calculated using the method of images as the potential energy between the original charge and the image charge. 



---------------

Since that gives U = -k R q²/(d² + R² ), but none of the options have that. 



---------------

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the image charge formula. Let me check again. 

Wait, another thought: the

---------------

 potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to the point, which involves the induced charges. 



---------------

The potential at the point where we place q is the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, the

---------------

 induced charges are present but their potential at the sphere's surface is zero. 

The potential at the location of q is V

---------------

 = (k * Q_induced * R)/d, where Q_induced is the induced charge on the sphere? 



---------------

Hmm, not sure. 

Alternatively, using the method of images, the potential at the point where q is placed is the sum of the potential from the image charge and the potential from the sphere's surface. 



---------------

Wait, the sphere's surface is at zero potential, so the potential due to the sphere's surface charges at any point must

---------------

 satisfy that. The image charge is placed such that the total potential on the sphere is zero. 

The potential at the location of q is V

---------------

 = V_image + V_sphere. 

But the sphere's contribution to the potential at the point of q is part of the image

---------------

's setup. The image charge is chosen so that the total potential (from the original charge and image) on the sphere's surface is zero. 

The

---------------

 potential at the point where q is placed (distance d from center) would be the sum of the potential from q and the image charge? 

Wait, the

---------------

 total potential at that point is V_total = (k q)/0 (which is infinity) plus the potential from the image charge and

---------------

 the sphere's surface. That can't be. 

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is calculated as the work done to assemble the system, which is

---------------

 the work to bring the charge q to its position in the presence of the induced charges. 

Using the method of images, the

---------------

 work done is the potential at the point multiplied by q. The potential at the point (due to the image charge) is V = k q' / (distance between q and image).

---------------

 

Wait, the image charge is at a distance a = R²/d from the center, so the distance between q and the image is d + a = (d² + R²)/d. 

So

---------------

 the potential at the point of q due to the image charge is V = k q' / [ (d² + R²)/d ] = k (

---------------

 - R q /d ) * d/(d² + R² ) 

Which simplifies to V = -k R q / (d² + R² )

Therefore

---------------

, the potential energy U is the work done, which is q * V = q * [ -k R q / (d² + R² ) ] 

Thus

---------------

, U = -k R q²/(d² + R² )

This matches what I had earlier. But the options don't have this. 



---------------

Wait, maybe the question is considering the potential energy of the system including the sphere's induced charges. The potential energy of a charge distribution on

---------------

 a sphere is (1/2) Q V, but since the sphere's potential is zero, that term would be zero. 

Hmm

---------------

, perhaps the potential energy of the system is just the energy of the charge and the image charge. 

Alternatively, maybe I messed

---------------

 up the image charge calculation. Let me see an example. 

Suppose R = d. Then the image charge would be at R²/d = R. So the

---------------

 image charge is at the surface. The charge q' = - (R/d) q = -q. 

Then the distance between q and q' is d + R²/d = 2R. 

So

---------------

 the potential energy would be k q (-q) / (2R) = -k q²/(2R). 

But

---------------

 according to my formula, -k R q²/(d² + R²) = -k R q²/(2 R²) = -k q²/(2 R),

---------------

 which matches. 

Looking at the options, if R = d, then option C would give: 

- (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R²) → denominator is

---------------

 zero, so undefined. 

Option A: - (1/2) k q² d/(d² + R²) → since

---------------

 d = R, this is - (1/2) k q² R/(2 R²) → -k q²/(4 R),

---------------

 which doesn't match. 

So in this case, my formula gives the correct answer for R = d, but none of the options do. 



---------------

Hmm, so perhaps the options are incorrect, but maybe I made a mistake in the problem's setup. 

Alternatively, maybe the question

---------------

 assumes that the charge is placed outside the sphere (d > R), and the formula is different. Wait, but the image

---------------

 charge method works for any d except when d = R. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is option C. Let me see.

---------------

 

Suppose the correct formula is U = - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R²). 

Let

---------------

 me plug in R = d. Then denominator is zero, which would be a problem, but in reality, when d = R, the system

---------------

 is a charge on the surface of the sphere, which would have infinite potential energy, but the formula gives infinity. 

Hmm, but

---------------

 when d approaches R from above, the denominator approaches zero, so the potential energy goes to negative infinity, which is plausible.

---------------

 

Wait, maybe my earlier approach is missing a factor of 1/2. Let me think again about the potential energy of

---------------

 the system. 

The potential energy of a system of charges is (1/2) times the sum over all pairs. In

---------------

 this case, the system includes the original charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. However, the induced charges are represented

---------------

 by the image charge q', so the total energy is (1/2)(q * V_imposed_on_q + q' * V_imposed_on_q' ). 

The potential at q due to q' is V_q

---------------

 = k q' / r, where r is the distance between them. 

The potential at q' due to q is the same value

---------------

, since it's symmetric. 

Therefore, the total energy is (1/2)(q*(k q' / r) + q'*(k q / r )) = (1/2)(2 k q q' / r ) = k q q' / r. 

So

---------------

 that gives the same result as before. So the 1/2 factor cancels out. 

Hmm, so that doesn

---------------

't help. 

Wait, maybe the question is considering the potential energy of the charge and the sphere's induced charges. The sphere

---------------

's charges are distributed, so their contribution to the potential energy would be part of the total. 

The potential energy of the induced charges on

---------------

 the sphere can be calculated as (1/2) Q V, where Q is the charge on the sphere and V its potential. But the sphere's potential is zero (since it's grounded), so that term is zero. 

The

---------------

 potential energy of the original charge and the induced charges would then be q times the potential at its location due to the induced charges. 

The potential at q's location due to the induced charges is V

---------------

_induced. 

Using the image method, the total potential at q's location is the potential due to q plus the potential due to the image charge. 



---------------

But since the sphere's potential is zero, the potential at the surface is zero, but the potential at q's position is

---------------

 not. 

Wait, the potential at q's location is V_total = V_image + V_q (from the charge itself). 

But

---------------

 the potential energy U is the work done to assemble the system. 

When assembling, you first place the charge q at distance

---------------

 d, which induces charges on the sphere. The work done is q multiplied by the potential at its position due to the induced charges (

---------------

before it was placed there). 

Wait, but the induced charges are a result of placing q there, so it's a chicken and egg problem. 

Alternatively, using the image method, the work

---------------

 done is the same as the potential energy between q and q', so the result should be as before. 

Hmm, I

---------------

'm stuck. The options don't match my calculation. Let me check the options again. 

Wait, option C has R

---------------

 squared in the numerator. Let me see if there's a different approach. 

Suppose the sphere is an isolated conducting sphere,

---------------

 uncharged. Then the potential energy would be different. But the question says grounded, which means the sphere can have induced charges but

---------------

 no net charge? Or the net charge can be anything but potential is zero. 

Alternatively, maybe the formula for the potential energy when

---------------

 the sphere is grounded is indeed - (1/2) k q^2 R²/(d^2 - R^2). 



---------------

Wait, let me think of the case when the charge is placed outside the sphere (d > R). 

Suppose d

---------------

 is very large compared to R. Then the potential energy should approach the potential energy of a point charge in isolation, which is zero?

---------------

 Or maybe the energy is approaching k q^2/(2d), because the potential at the charge's location is V = (k q)/d, so the energy is (1/2) q V = (1/2) q*(k q)/d = (k q^2)/(2d). 

Wait

---------------

, that's a different approach. 

Hmm, if the potential energy of a charge in its own field is (1/2) q V,

---------------

 where V is the potential at its location due to all other charges. 

So in this case, the potential at the location of q is due to the induced charges on the sphere. 



---------------

So the potential energy would be (1/2) q * V_induced. 

Wait, but the potential at the charge's location is V_total = V_induced + (k q)/r (

---------------

but r is zero, so that term is infinite. Hmm, no. 

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is (1/2) q

---------------

 V, where V is the potential at the location of q due to all other charges (i.e., the induced charges).

---------------

 

The potential due to the induced charges at q's position is V_induced = V_image (since the image charge represents the induced charges). 

So

---------------

 V_induced = k q' / (distance between q and image charge). 

The distance between them is (d² + R²)/d. 

So V_induced = k *

---------------

 (- R q/d) / [ (d² + R²)/d ] = -k R q / (d² + R² )



---------------

Thus, the potential energy U = (1/2) q * V_induced = (1/2) q * [ -k R q/(d² + R²) ] 

So

---------------

 U = - (1/2) k R q² / (d² + R² )

This is half of my previous result. So

---------------

 now this gives option A if R is replaced by d? Wait, option A has d in the numerator. 

Hmm, so

---------------

 this approach gives U = - (1/2) k R q² / (d² + R² ). 

Looking

---------------

 at the options, option A is U = - (1/2) k q² d/(d² + R² ).

---------------

 

Hmm, so this is different. 

Ah! So here's a discrepancy. 

The question is whether the potential energy is (

---------------

1/2) q V or q V. 

In the standard case of bringing a charge into an existing potential, the work done is q multiplied

---------------

 by the potential at the point (due to other charges). 

So if the induced charges are already there, then the work done

---------------

 to bring q is q * V_induced. 

However, the induced charges themselves depend on q's presence. Hence, you

---------------

 can't separate it so easily. 

This is the problem with self-energy. 

The method of images allows us to calculate

---------------

 the potential energy as the work done to assemble the system. 

If you consider assembling the system by first placing the charge q at

---------------

 distance d, which induces charges on the sphere. The work done is q times the potential at that point due to the induced charges. But since the induced charges are a

---------------

 response to q's presence, the potential at that point before placing q would be zero (since the sphere is grounded and initially

---------------

 uncharged). 

Wait, so the potential at the point before placing q is zero. Then the work done to bring q there

---------------

 is q*(V_final - V_initial) = q*(V_induced + (k q)/r - 0). But the

---------------

 (k q)/r term is infinite. 

Hmm, this is a problem. 

Alternatively, the method of images gives

---------------

 the potential energy between q and q', so the correct answer is U = k q q' / r. 

Given that the

---------------

 options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake in the image charge's position or charge. 

Wait, let me see

---------------

 another source. 

Wait, according to standard references, the potential energy of a point charge outside a grounded conducting sphere is indeed

---------------

 ( -k q² R )/(d² + R² ). 

But looking at the options given, there's no such option. 



---------------

Hmm, the options given here are:

A) U= - (1/2) kq² d/(d² + R²)

B) U= -kq² d/(d² - R²)

C) U= - (1/2)kq² R²/(d² - R²)

D) U= - (1/2)*kq² R/(d² - R²)

None

---------------

 of these match. 

Wait, perhaps the question is not about a grounded sphere but an isolated one? Let me see.

---------------

 

If the sphere were isolated and uncharged, then the image charge would be placed at R²/d, but the charge

---------------

 would be q' = (R/d) q. Wait, no, for an isolated sphere, the image charge is different

---------------

. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the sign. 

Wait, let me think again of the potential energy calculation

---------------

 with the image charge. 

The image charge is q' = - (R q)/d. The distance between them is (d² + R²)/d. 

So

---------------

 the potential energy is U = k * q * q' / r = k q * (-R q/d) / [ (d² + R²)/d ] 

=

---------------

 -k R q² / (d² + R² )

Hmm, this is the same as before. 

Looking at option C: U

---------------

 = - (1/2)k q² R²/(d² - R² )

If I factor in a different

---------------

 distance, like (d - R), but that doesn't seem. 

Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the image charge for

---------------

 a grounded sphere. Let me check another approach. 

Suppose the sphere is grounded, so its potential is zero. The potential at the center

---------------

 of the sphere is (k q)/d (distance from charge to center) plus the potential due to the sphere's induced charges. 



---------------

Wait, the potential at the center must also be zero? No, the potential on the surface is zero. 

Wait, the potential at any point inside the conductor must be the

---------------

 same as the surface. 

Hmm, the potential at the center of the sphere would be (k q)/d (since

---------------

 it's the distance from the charge to the center) plus the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere. 

But

---------------

 the induced charges create a potential at the center. 

Alternatively, the method of images for a grounded sphere gives that the potential energy

---------------

 is indeed ( -k q² R ) / (d² + R² ), but that is not among the options. 

Perhaps

---------------

 there's a mistake in the problem's options. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the potential energy of the charge

---------------

 and the induced charges on the sphere. 

The induced charge on the sphere is Q = - q' = (R q)/d. 

The potential energy of

---------------

 the sphere's charges is (1/2) Q * V_sphere. But the sphere's potential is zero. So that term is zero. 

The potential energy between the charge q and the sphere's induced charges is q

---------------

 * V_induced at q's location. 

The potential at q's location due to the induced charges is V_induced = k

---------------

 Q / (distance from sphere's surface to q). 

Wait, the distance from the sphere's surface to q is (d - R). 

So

---------------

 V_induced = k (R q/d) / (d - R). 

Wait, but this approach is unclear. 

Alternatively, the

---------------

 potential at q's location due to the induced charges is V = - (k q R )/(d (d - R)

---------------

 ). Not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's parameters. The question says the charge is placed d

---------------

 distance away from the center. So the distance from the surface would be (d - R), but the formula still uses d. 

Hmm, I

---------------

'm stuck. Given that my calculation leads to U = -k R q²/(d² + R² ), and none

---------------

 of the options have this, but option C has R squared in the numerator. 

Wait, perhaps the image charge is placed

---------------

 at a different position? Like R^2/d from the surface instead of the center. 

Wait, no. The standard formula

---------------

 is that the image charge is at a distance of R²/d from the center. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the charge

---------------

 of the image charge. Let me check another source's formula. 

Wait, according to the method of images for a grounded conducting sphere,

---------------

 the image charge is placed at a distance of R²/d from the center, and has a charge of q' = - (R/d) q. So that's correct. 

Hmm

---------------

, perhaps the options are wrong, but I have to choose from them. 

Wait, let me think of an example where

---------------

 d is much larger than R. Let’s say d is very large. 

In this case, the potential energy should approximate the energy of a charge in isolation

---------------

, which is zero? Or maybe the energy approaches zero because the sphere's influence becomes negligible. 

Using my result: U �

---------------

� -k R q² / d². 

Option C would give - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² -

---------------

 R² ) ≈ - (1/2) k q² R² / d² when d is large. 

Option

---------------

 A gives - (1/2) k q² d/(d² + R² ) ≈ - (1/2) k q² /d.

---------------

 

So my result gives U ~ - (R/d²) terms, which is different from option C's ~ - (R²/d²).

---------------

 

Hmm, so if d is large, which is correct? 

In the case of a grounded sphere, when the charge is far away, the induced charges on the sphere are

---------------

 small, and the potential energy should be approximately the same as the energy between the charge and the induced dipole. 

Wait

---------------

, maybe the potential energy is proportional to q^2/(d^3), but that's getting into multipole expansions. 

Alternatively, when

---------------

 d is large, the sphere's influence is like a dipole. The image charge method gives U = -k R q^2/(d^2 + R^2)

---------------

 ~ -k R q^2/d^2. 

So my result is correct in that limit, but the options don't have that. 

Hmm

---------------

, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm missing a factor. 

Wait, let me think again of the potential

---------------

 energy expression. 

The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to distance d from the sphere's center. 

The

---------------

 potential at the point due to the sphere's induced charges is V = - (k q R)/(d (d + R)).

---------------

 

Wait, not sure. 

Alternatively, using the method of images, the potential energy between the two point charges is U

---------------

 = k q q' / r. 

q' = - (R q)/d. 

r = d + R²/d. 

So U

---------------

 = k * q * (-R q/d) / (d + R²/d) 

= -k R q²/(d^

---------------

2 + R^2) 

Hmm, so this must be the correct answer, but it's not among the options. 

Looking

---------------

 back, the options are:

A) U= - (1/2) kq² d/(d² + R²)

B) U= -kq² d/(d² - R²)

C) U= - (1/2)kq² R²/(d² - R²)

D) U= - (1/2)*kq² R/(d² - R²)

Wait

---------------

, maybe I made a mistake in the denominator. Suppose the distance between the charge and image is d - (R^2/d),

---------------

 but that would be if the image is on the same side. 

Wait, no, the image is on the opposite side. The

---------------

 distance between them is d + R^2/d. 

Wait, maybe the problem assumes that the distance is from the surface?

---------------

 

If the charge is placed at distance d from the surface, then the distance from the center is D = R + d. 

But

---------------

 the question says distance d from the center. 

Alternatively, maybe the formula is different when the sphere is grounded versus isolated. 

Wait, for

---------------

 an isolated sphere with charge Q, the potential energy would involve the charge on the sphere. 

But in this case, the

---------------

 sphere is grounded, so its charge is variable. 

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Since none of the options match my calculation

---------------

, perhaps I made a mistake in the image charge's charge or position. 

Wait, let me recheck the image charge's

---------------

 position and charge. 

The image charge for a grounded sphere is placed inside the sphere at a distance of R²/d from the center. The charge is q' = - (R q)/d. 

Yes. 

So

---------------

 the potential energy is between q and q' separated by (d + R²/d). 

So the calculation is correct. 

Hmm

---------------

, perhaps the answer is option C but with a sign error. 

Wait, option C has a denominator of d² - R². Which

---------------

 would be positive if d > R. 

Wait, my denominator is d² + R^2, which is always positive. 

Option

---------------

 B has denominator d² - R², which would be positive if d > R. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made

---------------

 a mistake in the sign of the image charge. 

Suppose the image charge is positive. Then the potential energy would be positive. But that

---------------

 contradicts the problem's options. 

Alternatively, the image charge's position is R^2/d from the original charge's

---------------

 side. 

Wait, if the image is on the same side as the original charge, then the distance between them is d - R^2/d. 

Then

---------------

 the denominator becomes (d^2 - R^2)/d. 

Then the potential energy would be: 

k q q

---------------

' / r = k q (- R q/d ) divided by ( (d^2 - R^2)/d ) 

=

---------------

 -k R q^2 / (d^2 - R^2 )

Which matches option B. 

Ah! Wait

---------------

, perhaps I got the direction of the image charge wrong. 

The image charge is placed along the line from the center to the original charge, but inside the sphere. So the

---------------

 distance from the original charge to the image is d - R^2/d. 

Wait, let me clarify. 

The

---------------

 original charge is at distance d from the center. The image charge is at distance a = R²/d from the center,

---------------

 on the same line but inside the sphere. So the separation between them is d - a = d - R²/d. 

Ah

---------------

! This is the mistake I made earlier! 

I assumed the image was on the opposite side, but actually, it's on the same side.

---------------

 

So the distance between q and q' is d - (R²/d). 

So the separation is (d^2 - R^2)/d. 

Therefore

---------------

, the potential energy is: 

k * q * (-R q/d) divided by [ (d^2 - R^2)/d ] 

=

---------------

 -k R q^2 / (d^2 - R^2 )

This matches option B. 

Ah! So

---------------

 the mistake was in the direction of the image charge. 

The image charge is placed along the same line as the original charge, but

---------------

 inside the sphere, so the distance between them is d - (R^2/d). 

Therefore, the correct potential energy is U

---------------

 = -k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2) ?

Wait, no, let me redo the calculation:

---------------

 

q' = - (R q)/d 

distance between q and q' is d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2)/d 

So

---------------

 U = (k * q * q') / (distance) 

= [k * q * (-R q/d)] / [ (d^2 - R^2)/d ] 

The d

---------------

 in the denominator cancels with the d in the numerator from the distance denominator. 

So numerator: -k R q^2 /d 

Denominator: (d^2 - R^2)/d → dividing

---------------

 gives 

- k R q^2 / (d^2 - R^2 )

So the potential energy is U = -k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2).

---------------

 

Wait, but the options have option B as U= -kq² d/(d² -R²). 

Hmm, that

---------------

's different. 

Wait, let me check the calculation again. 

Wait, the numerator after substitution is -k q *

---------------

 q' * d/(d^2 - R^2) ? 

Wait, let me re-calculate step by step. 

The

---------------

 image charge is at a distance of R²/d from the center, on the same side as the original charge. 

The

---------------

 separation between q and q' is: 

distance between them = d - a = d - (R²/d) 

= (d^2 - R^2)/d 

So

---------------

 the separation is (d² - R²)/d. 

The potential energy is: 

U = k * q * q' / separation 

= k * q * ( - R q / d ) / [ (d^2 - R^2)/d ] 

The

---------------

 denominators: the d in the denominator from q' and the denominator of the separation's denominator. 

Let me compute numerator

---------------

 and denominator: 

Numerator: -k R q² / d 

Denominator: (d² - R²)/d 

Thus, dividing

---------------

 numerator by denominator gives: 

(-k R q² /d ) / ( (d² - R²)/d ) 

The d in

---------------

 the denominator and the d in the numerator of the denominator cancel out. 

Result: -k R q² / (d² - R² )

So

---------------

 U = -k q^2 R / (d² - R² )

Looking at the options: 

Option B is U = -k q² d/(d² - R² )



---------------

Option C is U = - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R² )

Option D is - (1/2) k q² R/(d² - R² )

So

---------------

 the correct expression is -k R q²/(d² - R² ), which is not exactly any option. 

Wait, option

---------------

 B has a numerator of d instead of R. 

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the charge of the image. 

Wait, the

---------------

 image charge formula for a grounded sphere: 

The image charge is located at a distance a = R^2/d from the center, and its

---------------

 charge is q' = - (R/d) q. 

Yes. 

So the calculation is correct. 

Hmm. 



---------------

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the potential energy of the system including the sphere's induced charge. 

The sphere's induced charge is Q = q' = - (R q)/d. 

The potential energy between the sphere's charge and the original charge is k

---------------

 q Q / (distance between them). 

The distance between the sphere's charge and q is the distance from the sphere's surface to q?

---------------

 Or the center? 

The sphere's charge is distributed on its surface. The potential energy between the charge q and the induced charge on the sphere would

---------------

 be the work done to assemble them. 

The potential at the location of q due to the sphere's induced charge is V_sphere = k Q / (d - R)

---------------

 

Wait, the distance from the sphere's surface to q is (d - R). 

So the potential at q's location due to the sphere is k*(

---------------

 - R q /d ) / (d - R). 

The potential energy would be q * V_sphere = q * [ -k R q/(d (d - R)) ] 

=

---------------

 -k R q² / [ d (d - R) ) ]

Hmm, but this is different again. 

Alternatively, if

---------------

 we consider the potential energy between the original charge and the sphere's induced charge, the sphere's charge is distributed on the surface, so the potential energy is the

---------------

 integral over the sphere's surface of (1/2) σ V, but since the potential on the sphere is zero, that

---------------

's zero. 

Hmm, this is getting too convoluted. 

Wait, going back, the method of images gives

---------------

 the potential energy between the two charges as U = -k R q²/(d² - R² ). 

None of the options have this.

---------------

 

Wait, option C has R squared in the numerator. If I made a mistake in the image charge's charge. 

Suppose the image charge's charge is q' = - (R^2 q)/d²?

---------------

 No, that's not the standard formula. 

Alternatively, maybe the image charge's charge is q' = - (R q)/d,

---------------

 but the potential energy is between the charge q and the sphere's induced charge, which is Q = q'. 

The distance between q and the sphere's surface

---------------

 is (d - R), so the potential energy would be k q Q/(d - R) 

= k q *

---------------

 (- R q/d ) / (d - R) 

= -k R q²/(d (d - R))

---------------

 

Hmm, which is different. 

Alternatively, the distance between q and the center of the sphere is d, and the sphere

---------------

's induced charge is on its surface. 

The potential energy between q and the sphere's induced charge is k * q * Q / d

---------------

 

Since the sphere's induced charge is Q = q' = - R q /d. 

Thus, U = k q *

---------------

 ( - R q/d ) / d 

= -k R q² / d² 

Hmm, but that also doesn't match. 

Wait

---------------

, this is getting frustrating. 

The only option that has the denominator d^2 - R^2 is option B and C. 

My

---------------

 calculation with the corrected image position gives U = -k R q^2/(d^2 - R^2 ), which is

---------------

 not an option. 

Wait, maybe the question has a typo and option B is missing an R in the numerator. 

Alternatively, maybe I messed

---------------

 up the image charge's position. 

Wait, let me look for a standard formula. 

Upon checking, the potential energy of a point charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R is indeed given

---------------

 by U = - (k q^2 R)/(d^2 - R^2). 

This matches the calculation I

---------------

 did after correcting the image charge's position. 

Therefore, the correct answer should be option B if the numerator were R instead of d. But option B has d

---------------

 in the numerator. 

Hmm. 

Wait, no, the calculation gives numerator R, so there must be a mistake in the options. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made

---------------

 a mistake in the sign of the image charge's distance. 

Wait, if the image charge is on the opposite side, then the separation is d + R^2/d. 

Then

---------------

 the potential energy would be -k R q^2/(d^2 + R^2), which is not an option. 

Hmm

---------------

. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy of the system as the energy between the charge and the induced charges

---------------

, and the induced charges are considered as a dipole. 

The induced dipole moment p is proportional to q*d.

---------------

 The potential energy of a dipole in an external field is - p E. 

The electric field at the dipole's location due to the charge is k q /d². 

The

---------------

 dipole moment p = Q * (2a), where a is the separation? Not sure. 

Alternatively, the dipole moment would

---------------

 be p = Q * 2R (since the charges are on the sphere's surface), but this is getting too vague. 

Hmm

---------------

. 

Alternatively, let me think of the formula for potential energy of a charge near a grounded sphere. 

According to some

---------------

 references, the potential energy is indeed U = - (k q^2 R)/(d^2 - R^2).

---------------

 

If that's the case, then the correct answer is option B if it had R instead of d. 

Wait, option

---------------

 B is: 

B) U = -k q² d/(d² - R^2 )

Ah! Here's the mistake

---------------

. 

Wait in my calculation, the numerator is R, but the formula in the options has d. 

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 I made a mistake in the charge of the image. 

Wait, let me recalculate the image charge's charge. 

The image

---------------

 charge for a grounded sphere is q' = - (R q)/d. 

So the potential energy is 

U = k * q * q' / r

---------------

 

= k * q * (-R q/d) / ( (d^2 - R^2)/d ) 

=

---------------

 -k R q²/(d^2 - R^2 )

Yes. 

So the correct expression is -k R q²/(d^2 - R^2 ),

---------------

 which is not among the options. 

Wait, option C is - (1/2) k q² R^2/(d^2 - R^2 ).

---------------

 

Hmm, perhaps the question is considering the energy as the work done to bring the charge and the induced charge, which would

---------------

 be half of that? 

Wait, if the potential energy between two charges is k q1 q2/r, then the

---------------

 total energy is that. But if you consider assembling them one by one, the work done is q1 * V2 +

---------------

 q2 * V1, which equals twice the energy. 

Wait, no, the work done to bring q1 then

---------------

 q2 is q1*0 (since first charge has no field) plus q2*(k q1 /r).

---------------

 So total work is k q1 q2 /r, which is the same as the potential energy. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps the question is asking for the potential energy of the charge and the induced charges on the sphere, and the induced charges'

---------------

 energy is also considered. 

The potential energy of the induced charges on the sphere would be (1/2) Q V

---------------

, where Q is the induced charge and V the potential at the sphere's surface. But the sphere's potential is zero, so that term is zero. 

Thus

---------------

, the total potential energy is just the energy between q and q', which is -k R q²/(d^2 - R^2 ). 

Since

---------------

 this isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but with a typo. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the problem

---------------

's parameters. 

Wait, looking back, maybe I made a mistake in the image charge's position. 

The image charge is placed

---------------

 at a distance of R^2/d from the center, so if the original charge is at distance d from the center, the separation between them is d - R^2/d,

---------------

 which is (d^2 - R^2)/d. 

Thus, the potential energy is: 

U = k *

---------------

 q * q' / separation 

q' = - R q /d 

Thus, substituting: 

U = k * q * (- R q/d ) / [ (d^2 - R^2)/d ] 

The

---------------

 d in the denominator cancels with the d in the numerator of the separation's denominator. 

So U = -k R q^2 / (d^2 - R^2 ).

---------------

 

This is the correct result. 

Now, looking at the options again, none of them have this exact form. 



---------------

Wait, option C has R squared in the numerator but also a 1/2 factor. 

Option D has R in the numerator and

---------------

 a 1/2 factor. 

Hmm. 

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the potential energy is calculated differently

---------------

. 

Perhaps the potential energy is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, and the work done is

---------------

 q multiplied by the potential at that point due to the induced charges. 

The potential at the point due to the induced charges is V

---------------

_induced. 

Using the image charge method, the potential at the point where q is placed is the potential from the image charge plus the potential from q itself. 

But the potential due to q itself at that point is infinite, so this

---------------

 approach is invalid. 

Alternatively, the potential due to the induced charges is V_induced = k q' / (distance between q and q') 

Which

---------------

 is k*(- R q/d ) / ( (d^2 - R^2)/d ) 

= -k R q/(d^2 - R^2 )



---------------

Thus, the work done is q * V_induced = q * (-k R q)/(d^2 - R^2 ) 

=

---------------

 -k R q^2/(d^2 - R^2 )

This matches the earlier result. 

Given that the

---------------

 options don't have this, but option B has d in the numerator instead of R, I must have made a mistake.

---------------

 

Wait, perhaps the question is not about a grounded sphere but an isolated one? 

For an isolated conducting sphere, the image charge would be placed

---------------

 at R²/d from the center, but with charge q' = (R q)/d. 

Then the potential energy would be k

---------------

 q (R q/d ) / ( (d^2 - R^2)/d ) 

= k R q^2/(d^2 - R^2 )

But

---------------

 since it's an isolated sphere, the total charge is Q = q', so the potential energy would include the energy of the sphere's charge.

---------------

 

The potential energy of the sphere's charge is (1/2) Q V_sphere. 

V_sphere = k Q/R 

Thus, the

---------------

 total energy would be (1/2) Q * (k Q/R ) = (k Q^2)/(2R)

---------------

 

Adding this to the energy between q and Q: 

U_total = k q Q/(d - R) + (k Q^2)/(2R) 

But

---------------

 this is getting too complex. 

Alternatively, for an isolated sphere, the potential energy is (k q² R)/(d^2 - R^2 ),

---------------

 which would be option B's expression with d replaced by R in the numerator. 

But the problem states the sphere is grounded, so this

---------------

 is not applicable. 

Hmm. 

Given that my calculation leads to U = -k R q^2/(d^2 - R^2 ), and the

---------------

 closest option is B but with d instead of R, perhaps there is a mistake in the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made

---------------

 a mistake in the image charge's charge. 

Wait, if the image charge were q' = - (R^2 q)/d^2, then the numerator

---------------

 would have R squared. 

But according to the method of images for a grounded sphere, the charge is - (R q)/d. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively

---------------

, maybe I have to consider that the potential energy is the work done to assemble the system, which is (1/2) q

---------------

 V. 

The potential at the charge's position due to the induced charges is V = k q' / (separation).

---------------

 

Which is -k R q/(d^2 - R^2 ). 

Thus, U = (1/2) q * V = (1/2) q * (-k R q)/(d^2 - R^2 ) = - (1/2) k R q^2/(d^2 - R^2 ). 

This matches option D,

---------------

 which has R in the numerator and the denominator (d² - R²), but with a 1/2 factor. 

Wait

---------------

, option D is U = - (1/2)*kq² R/(d² - R²). 

Ah! So

---------------

 this is exactly what I just calculated. 

Ah! Here's the mistake. 

Earlier, I considered the potential energy as the

---------------

 work done to bring the charge q to its position, which is q multiplied by the potential at that point due to the induced charges. 

But

---------------

 the potential energy is actually (1/2) q V, because the charge itself contributes to the potential. 

Wait, the

---------------

 formula for potential energy when assembling a system is the work done to bring each charge to its position one by one. 

First

---------------

, the sphere is grounded and uncharged. Then, bringing q to distance d from the center. 

The work done is q multiplied by the potential at that point due to all

---------------

 other charges before placing q. 

Before placing q, the sphere is uncharged (grounded), so the potential at the point is zero. 

Thus

---------------

, the work done is q*(0) = 0? 

But that can't be right because the induced charges are

---------------

 a result of placing q there. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, the potential energy is the work done against the electric field.

---------------

 

The electric field due to the induced charges on the sphere. 

The work done is the integral from infinity to d of F dx

---------------

. 

But this requires knowing the field. 

Alternatively, using the method of images, the potential energy between the two charges (q and q') is U

---------------

 = k q q' / r = -k R q²/(d² - R^2 ), which is the correct

---------------

 answer but not listed. 

However, if the question considers the potential energy as (1/2) of that (perhaps

---------------

 because the energy is counted twice in the two charges?), then it would be - (1/2) k R q²/(d² - R^2 ), which matches option D. 

Ah

---------------

! This must be the case. 

The potential energy of a system of two charges is U = k q1 q2 / r. 

However, when

---------------

 considering the system as two charges, the potential energy is the work done to assemble them. 

But when you bring the first charge,

---------------

 there's no work. Then the second charge is brought in the field of the first, so the total work is k q1 q2 / r. 

Thus

---------------

, the potential energy is indeed that value. 

However, if the image charge is considered a mathematical construct and not a real charge, then perhaps the potential

---------------

 energy of the real system (charge q and the induced charges on the sphere) is half of that value. 

This might be the

---------------

 case if the image charge is part of the system. 

Wait, in the method of images, the image charge is a

---------------

 mathematical construct, so the actual system has only the real charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. 

The potential energy of

---------------

 the system is the work done to assemble the real charge in the presence of the induced charges. 

The induced charges are a

---------------

 result of the real charge's presence, so the work done is equal to the potential energy between the real charge and the induced charges. 

The

---------------

 induced charges can be represented by the image charge. 

Thus, the potential energy is the same as the potential energy between the real charge and the image charge. 

However

---------------

, the induced charges are not a point charge, so maybe the potential energy is different. 

Alternatively, since the image charge represents

---------------

 the effect of the induced charges, the potential energy between the real charge and the image charge is the correct value. 

But

---------------

 since the image charge is not real, perhaps the actual potential energy is half of that. 

This is a common point of confusion. 

The

---------------

 potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them. 

If you have two charges, the work is k

---------------

 q1 q2 / r. 

But in the case of induced charges on a conductor, the charges are not fixed,

---------------

 so the work done is different. 

However, in the method of images, the potential energy of the real charge and the induced

---------------

 charges is exactly the same as the potential energy between the real charge and the image charge. 

Therefore, the answer should be U = -k R q²/(d² - R^2 ), which is not among

---------------

 the options. 

But option D is - (1/2)*kq² R/(d² - R^2).

---------------

 

Hmm, maybe the question is considering the potential energy of the charge and the sphere's induced charge, and the sphere's induced

---------------

 charge is considered as a distributed charge, so the energy is half of the image charge's energy. 

In that case, the answer

---------------

 would be option D. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of the image charge's contribution. 

Alternatively

---------------

, I'll have to choose the closest option. 

Given that my calculation gives U = -k R q²/(d² - R^2 ), and

---------------

 option D is half that with R in the numerator, and option B has d in the numerator. 

The only option with the correct denominator and

---------------

 numerator is option B if the numerator were R instead of d, but since that's not the case, perhaps the correct answer is option B but

---------------

 I made a mistake. 

Wait, perhaps the image charge's position is on the other side, so the separation is d + R²/d, leading

---------------

 to denominator d² + R^2. 

Then the potential energy would be -k R q²/(d^2 + R^2 ), which is

---------------

 not an option. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo and option C is the right one but with R instead of R squared. 

Alternatively

---------------

, maybe I should trust my calculation and look for the closest option. 

Wait, the options are: 

A) -

---------------

 (1/2) kq² d/(d² + R^2 )

B) -kq² d/(d² - R² )

C) - (1/2)kq² R²/(d² - R² )

D) - (1/2)*kq² R/(d² - R² )

My calculation

---------------

 gives U = -k R q^2/(d^2 - R^2 ), which is exactly option B if instead

---------------

 of d in the numerator, it's R. 

But option B has d in the numerator. 

Hmm, this is very

---------------

 confusing. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is from a source where the formula is different. 

Wait, let me search for a

---------------

 standard problem. 

According to some sources, the potential energy of a point charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R is indeed

---------------

 U = - (k q^2 R)/(d^2 - R^2). 

Thus, the correct answer should be option

---------------

 B if the numerator is R instead of d. 

Since that's not the case, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's options. 

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 the charge is placed at a distance d from the surface, so the distance from the center is D = d + R. 

Then

---------------

 the formula would be U = -k R q^2/( (D)^2 - R^2 ) = -k R q^2/(d^2 + 2dR + R^2 - R^2 ) = -k R q^2/(d^2 + 2dR).

---------------

 

Which also doesn't match. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I made a mistake in the image

---------------

 charge's charge. 

If the image charge were q' = - (R^2 q)/d^2, then the potential energy would be:

---------------

 

U = k q (- R^2 q/d^2 ) / (d - R^2/d ) 

=

---------------

 -k R^2 q^2/(d^2 ( (d^2 - R^2)/d )) 

= -k R^2 q^2/(d (d^2 - R^2 )) 

Hmm

---------------

, not matching. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the image charge's charge. 

Wait, the image charge for

---------------

 a grounded sphere is q' = - (R q)/d. 

Thus, the calculation is correct. 

Given that none

---------------

 of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option B, with an error in the numerator. 

Alternatively, the question

---------------

 is asking for the potential energy of the system including the sphere's induced charges, and the induced charges' energy is (1/2) Q

---------------

 V. 

The induced charge Q is q', so Q = - R q/d. 

The potential on the sphere is zero, so the

---------------

 energy is zero. 

The potential energy between q and the induced charges is U = q * V_induced. 

V_induced = k Q / (d - R)

---------------

 

= k (-R q/d ) / (d - R) 

Thus, U = q * [ -k R q/(d (d - R) ) ] 

= -k R q²/(d (d - R) ) 

This

---------------

 can be written as -k R q²/(d^2 - R d ), but this doesn't match any option. 

Hmm. 

I

---------------

 think the most plausible answer, despite the discrepancy, is option B, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, the correct answer is option D.

---------------

 

Wait, let me recheck the calculation with the 1/2 factor. 

If the potential energy is (1/2) the

---------------

 energy between q and q', then U = (1/2)* (-k R q^2/(d^2 - R^2 

---------------

)), which would be option D if the denominator is d^2 - R^2 and the numerator is R. 

Option

---------------

 D has exactly that: - (1/2) k q² R/(d^2 - R^2). 

Thus

---------------

, perhaps the question considers the potential energy as half of the interaction energy between the charge and the image charge. 

This might

---------------

 be due to the image charge being a mathematical construct and not a real charge, so the actual energy is half the calculated value. 

In

---------------

 some cases, when using images, the potential energy of the real system is half the potential energy of the image system because the image represents

---------------

 the induced charges which are part of the system. 

Therefore, the correct answer would be option D. 

Yes, I think this is the case. 

The

---------------

 potential energy of the system is half of the interaction between q and the image charge. 

Thus, the answer is option D.


To determine the net potential energy of the system consisting

---------------

 of a charge \( q \) placed a distance \( d \) from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius \( R \), we use the method of images. 

1. **Image Charge Setup**: 


---------------

   - The grounded sphere introduces an image charge \( q' \) inside the sphere. 
   - The image charge is located at a distance \( \frac{R^2}{d} \) from the center along the line connecting the center to the original charge \( q \).
   - The magnitude of the image charge is \( q' = -\frac{R}{d} q \).

2. **Distance Between Charges**:
   - The separation between the original charge \( q \) and the image charge \( q' \) is \( d - \frac{R^2}{d} = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d} \).

3. **Potential Energy Calculation**:
   - The potential energy between the two charges is given by \( U = \frac{k q q'}{r} \).
   - Substituting \( q' \) and \( r \):
     \[
     U = \frac{k q \left(-\frac{R q}{d}\right)}{\frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}} = -\frac{k R q^2}{d^2 - R^2}
     \]
   - However, since the image charge represents the induced charges on the sphere (not a real charge), the potential

---------------

 energy of the real system is considered to be half of this interaction energy. This accounts for the factor of \( \frac{1}{2} \).

4. **Final Result**:
   - The

---------------

 net potential energy becomes:
     \[
     U = -\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{k q^2 R}{d^2 - R^2}
     \]
