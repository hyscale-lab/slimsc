Okay, so here's this question about the astronaut traveling to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud. Hmm, I need to figure out how long it takes from the astronaut's perspective. Let me think through

---------------

 this step by step.

First, the Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. I remember that it's about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. Wait, right

---------------

, so the distance is roughly 160,000 light-years. The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c, which is super close to the speed of light. Since

---------------

 the speed is so high, relativistic effects like time dilation must be significant here. 

The question asks for the time experienced by the astronaut, so we

---------------

 need to use the time dilation formula from special relativity. The formula for time experienced by the traveler (proper time) is given

---------------

 by the Lorentz contraction. The time measured in the Earth's frame would be the distance divided by speed. But from

---------------

 the astronaut's perspective, the distance is contracted. 

Wait, actually, the proper time τ is calculated using the formula τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time in the Earth's frame. Alternatively, since

---------------

 the distance is contracted in the astronaut's frame, they would see the distance as shorter. Let me make sure I get this right.

The

---------------

 distance between the LMC and Earth is 160,000 light-years in Earth's frame. At a

---------------

 speed of 0.99999987c, the time taken from Earth's perspective would be distance divided by speed. So,

---------------

 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ approximately 160,000 years. But that

---------------

's from Earth's frame. The astronaut's own time would be less due to time dilation. 

Alternatively, using the Lore

---------------

ntz factor gamma (γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²)), the time experienced by the astronaut (

---------------

proper time) would be the Earth's time divided by gamma. Wait, no, actually, the proper time is the time in

---------------

 the astronaut's frame. Let me think again.

The proper time is the time measured by the astronaut's clock. The formula

---------------

 for proper time when moving at velocity v for a distance d in Earth's frame is τ = (d / v) * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 



---------------

Alternatively, since the distance is contracted in the astronaut's frame, the contracted distance would be d' = d * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so the time would

---------------

 be d' / v = (d / v) * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So same as above

---------------

.

So first, let's compute v: 0.99999987c. Let me compute

---------------

 v squared over c squared. Let me denote v = c * (1 - ε), where ε is a small number. Let

---------------

's see: 0.99999987 is 1 minus 0.00000013. So ε

---------------

 is 1.3e-7. 

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute 1 - v²/c². Let me compute v

---------------

²/c² first. Since v is 0.99999987c, then (v/c)^2 = (0.99999987)^2. Let me calculate that. 



---------------

Let me approximate (1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x when x is very small. Here, x is 1.3e-7.

---------------

 So (0.99999987)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) = 1 - 2.6e-7. Therefore

---------------

, 1 - v²/c² ≈ 2.6e-7. 

Therefore, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ sqrt(2.6e-7). Let me compute sqrt(2.6e-7). Let

---------------

's see, sqrt(2.6) is approx 1.612, so sqrt(2.6e-7) = 1.612e-3.5?

---------------

 Wait, sqrt(1e-6) is 1e-3, so sqrt(2.6e-7) is sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5? Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 better to compute as 2.6e-7 = 2.6 × 10^-7. The square root would be sqrt(2.6)*10^(-7/2) = approx

---------------

 1.612 × 10^-3.5. Wait, 10^-3.5 is 10^(-3) * 10^(-0.5) ≈ 0.001 * 0.316 ≈ 3.16e-4. So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ approx

---------------

 5.1e-4. Hmm, but maybe I should do this more accurately. Alternatively, sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(260

---------------

e-9) = sqrt(260)*1e-4.5. Hmm, sqrt(260) is about

---------------

 16.12, so 16.12 * 1e-4.5? Wait, 

---------------

1e-4.5 is 3.16e-5, so 16.12 * 3.16e-5 ≈ 0.00051. So

---------------

 sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 0.0005099. Let's say

---------------

 approximately 5.1e-4.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 5.1e-4. 

Therefore

---------------

, the proper time τ = (distance / v) * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

The distance in Earth's frame is 160,000 light-years. Div

---------------

ided by v (which is 0.99999987c ≈ c for approximation), so distance

---------------

 / v ≈ 160,000 years. Multiply by the sqrt term (≈5.1e-4)

---------------

 gives τ ≈ 160,000 * 5.1e-4. Let's calculate that:



---------------

160,000 * 5.1e-4 = 160,000 * 0.00051 = 160 * 51 =

---------------

 8160? Wait, no. Wait 160,000 * 0.00051 is

---------------

 the same as 160,000 * 5.1 / 10,000. 

---------------

5.1 * 160,000 = 816,000. Divided by 10,000 is 81.6. So approximately

---------------

 81.6 years. 

Hmm, so that would be about 81 years. The options are 72, 81, 77, and

---------------

 B is 72, C is 81, D is77. So the answer is C? 

Wait, but let me check my

---------------

 approximations again. Maybe I oversimplified. Let me recalculate the sqrt(1 - v²/c²) more accurately. 

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps I should compute gamma first. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since 1 - v²/c² is 

---------------

2.6e-7, so gamma is 1/sqrt(2.6e-7). Let's compute sqrt(2.6e-7)

---------------

 as before. Let's see:

sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6)*sqrt(1e-7). sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5,

---------------

 which is ~3.16e-4. So sqrt(2.6)*3.16e-4 ≈ 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.1e-4. So gamma

---------------

 would be 1/(5.1e-4) ≈ 1960.78. 

Wait

---------------

, but the proper time is the Earth time divided by gamma. Wait, no, maybe I mixed up the formulas here. Let me think

---------------

 again. 

The proper time τ is the time experienced by the astronaut. The time in Earth's frame is t = distance / v. So

---------------

 t is 160,000 / 0.99999987c / (c) ???

---------------

 Wait, distance is in light-years, speed is in c. So distance is 160,000 light-years, and speed is 0.99999987c, so time t in

---------------

 Earth's frame is (160,000 light-years) / (0.99999987c) )

---------------

 = 160,000 / 0.99999987 years ≈ ~160,000 years. 

The astronaut's proper time is τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t * (sqrt

---------------

(1 - v²/c²)). 

Wait, that's the same as what I did before. So 160,000 * sqrt(2.6e-7). Wait

---------------

, but sqrt(2.6e-7) is ~5.1e-4, so 160,000 * 5.1e-4 �

---------------

� 160,000 * 0.00051 = 81.6 years. 

So that's

---------------

 about 81.6, so the closest answer is C) 81 years. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the

---------------

 calculation of 1 - v²/c². Let me check that again. 

v = 0.99999987c. 



---------------

v/c = 0.99999987, so (v/c)^2 = (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute this more precisely. 

(1 - 

---------------

1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2. The third

---------------

 term is negligible, so approximately 1 - 2.6e-7. So 1 - (v/c)^2 = 2.6e-7. That

---------------

's correct. 

Therefore, the calculation seems correct. So the astronaut would experience about 81.6 years. The options have

---------------

 81 as C, so that's the answer. 

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are:

A) The

---------------

 astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.

B) 72 years

C) 81 years

D) 77 years

So

---------------

 the answer is C. But let me think about the astronaut's age. The question says the astronaut is 22 years old.

---------------

 If the trip takes 81 years, then the astronaut would be 22 +81 = 103, but the average lifetime is 150 solar years, so they would

---------------

 survive. So A is not correct. 

Therefore, the answer must be C) 81 years. 

Wait, but why

---------------

 is 0.99999987c so close to c? Let me see. The gamma factor here

---------------

 is around 1/sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 1/(5.1e-4) ≈ 1960. So that

---------------

's a huge gamma. So the proper time is Earth time divided by gamma. Wait, no, wait. Wait, hold

---------------

 on. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-express the proper time formula correctly. 

The proper time τ is given

---------------

 by τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So that's correct. Alternatively, since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), then τ = t / gamma. 



---------------

Wait, so if gamma is 1960, then τ = t / gamma. If t is 160,000 years, then 160000 / 1960 ≈ 

---------------

81.6. Yes, exactly. So that's the same result. 

So that's correct. 

Therefore, the answer should be C.

---------------

 So I think the answer is C) 81 years.


To determine the time experienced by the astronaut traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to Earth at 0.99999987c, we use relativistic time dilation. The distance is approximately 160,000 light-years. 

First, calculate the time in Earth's frame:
\[
t = \frac{\text{distance}}{v} = \frac{160,\!000 \text{ light-years}}{0.99999987c} \approx 160,\!000 \text{ years}.
\]

Next, compute the Lorentz factor \

---------------

(\gamma\) and the time dilation factor \(\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}\):
\[
\frac{v}{c} = 0.99999987 \implies \left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2 \approx 1 - 2.6 \times 10^{-7},
\]
\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} \approx \sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 5.1 \times 10^{-4}.
\]

The astronaut's proper time \(\tau\) is:
\[
\tau = t \times \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} \approx 160,\!000 \times 5.1 \times 10^{-4} \approx 81.6 \text{ years}.
\]

The

---------------

 closest option is **C) 81 years**. The astronaut’s age (22 + 81 = 103 years) is within their 150-year lifespan, so option A is invalid.
