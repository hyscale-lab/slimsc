Okay, let's see. The question is about finding which mutation in the gene would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley. The gene has five exons and four introns, and we're looking at the first exon.

---------------

 The problem is that the current cultivar produces this bad compound, so we need to find a mutation that stops the gene from working

---------------

. The options are four different mutants, each with a change in the beginning of the first exon.

First, I need to recall

---------------

 that mutations can be of different types. Since they used EMS, which is ethyl methanesulfonate, a mutagen that typically causes point mutations (like base substitutions), so

---------------

 each mutant probably has a single nucleotide change, but maybe more? Wait, the sequences here show more than just one change.

---------------

 Let me look at each mutant's sequence compared to the intact gene.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…T

---------------

GA.

Let me compare each mutant's sequence to the original.

Starting with Mutant 1: The sequence given is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA.

Compar

---------------

ing to the original:

Original first part: ATGTTTCTCGCTG...

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTG...

Wait

---------------

, let me write them out aligned:

Original: ATGTTT CTCGCTG...
Mutant1: ATGTT C

---------------

 TACGCTG...

Hmm, maybe I should break it down base by base. Let's see:

Original: Let

---------------

 me write the first part in segments:

Original starts with:

Positions 1-3: ATG (start codon),

---------------

 then TTT (positions 4-6), then CTC (7-9), GCT (10-12), GGT (13-15), etc. Wait, perhaps

---------------

 writing the sequences with their nucleotide positions would help.

Wait, maybe I should look for the exact differences. Let me write

---------------

 the original and each mutant line by line.

Original first exon's sequence (starting at 5' end):

5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mut

---------------

ant 1's sequence:

5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Let

---------------

 me align them:

Original: A T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T...


---------------

Mutant1: A T G T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G C...

Wait

---------------

, let's compare each nucleotide step by step from the start. Let's see:

Starting from the first base (position

---------------

 1):

Original: A (pos1), T (2), G (3), T (4), T (5), T (6), C (7), T (8), C (9), G (10), C (11), T (12), G (13), G (14), T (15), A (16), C (17), T (18), T (19), C (20), T (21), G (22), T (23), G (24), G (25), A (26), T (27), G (28), A (29), A (30), C (31), A (32), T (33), A (34), T (35), T (36), T (37), A (38), T (39), T (40), G (41), T (42), C (43), G (44), T (45)...



---------------

Mutant1: A (1), T (2), G (3), T (4), T (5), C (6?),

---------------

 Wait let me check again. Wait, perhaps the first mutation is at position 6?

Wait maybe I should write them as

---------------

 strings:

Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...



---------------

Breaking down the first part:

The first few bases after ATG (start codon):

Original: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GA

---------------

...

Wait, let's see the exact sequences:

Original sequence up to where the mutants differ:

Original first part:

After the start codon (ATG),

---------------

 the next nucleotides are TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Wait

---------------

, perhaps it's easier to look at where the mutations occur.

Looking at Mutant 1: the first change is at

---------------

 the 6th position? Let me see:

Original: positions 1-24:

Positions 1-6: ATGTTT (so

---------------

 the first 6 bases are ATGTTT)

Mutant1's first 6 bases would be ATGTT?

---------------

 Wait, let me check:

Wait the original is ATGTTT (positions 1-6: A T G T T T)



---------------

Mutant1's sequence starts with ATGTTCTACG... Hmm. Let's see:

Original: A T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A

---------------

 T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T...

Mutant1's sequence:

---------------

 A T G T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G C...

Wait, so

---------------

 comparing the original and mutant1:

Original: ATGTTTCTC... (so the 7th base is C (

---------------

position7), then T (position8) etc.

Mutant1's sequence after ATG is T T C T A C G...

---------------

 Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me parse the mutant sequences more carefully.

Original sequence starts with:

ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT

Mut

---------------

ant1's sequence is:

ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC

Compar

---------------

ing the first parts:

Original: ATGTTTCTC... (positions 1-12: A T G T T T C T C G C T...)



---------------

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCT... So let's see each base:

Positions 1-5: A

---------------

 T G T T (same as original up to position5). Position6: Original has T, mutant1 has C?

---------------

 Wait, original's position6 is the sixth T (since the first 6 are ATGTTT). So position6 is T in

---------------

 original. Mutant1's position6 is C? Let me count:

Original: 1: A, 2:T,3:G,4:T,5:T,6:T,7:C,8:T,9:C,10:G,11:C,12:T,...



---------------

Mutant1: first letters:

Positions 1-5: A T G T T (same as original up to position5). Position6: C

---------------

 (since the next letters after ATGTT are T in original and C in mutant1). So position6 is T vs

---------------

 C here. Then position7: in original was C (position7), but mutant1's next is T (since after AT

---------------

GTT C comes next? Wait let me write the mutant1's first part again.

Wait the mutant1's sequence is

---------------

 written as:

ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

Breaking

---------------

 it down:

After ATG (positions 1-3), the next letters are T T C T A C G C T G

---------------

 G T A C T T... Wait, perhaps the mutation here is a substitution at position6 (changing T to C?), and then another

---------------

 substitution?

Wait maybe I should compare each position step by step.

Original first 12 bases:

1:A, 2:T,3:G,4:T,5:T,6:T,7:C,8:T,9:C,10:G,11:C,12:T.



---------------

Mutant1's first 12 bases:

1:A,2:T,3:G,4:T,5:T,6:C,7:T,8:A,9:C,10:G,11:C,12:T?



---------------

Wait that might not be right. Let me see:

Looking at the mutant1's sequence: after ATG (positions1-3), the next letters

---------------

 are T T C (positions4-6: T, T, C?), but original at positions4-6 are T, T, T (

---------------

positions4: T, 5: T,6:T). Wait, maybe I messed up the order. Let me write

---------------

 the mutant1's sequence as per the given string.

The original is:

Original: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant1 is

---------------

:

5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So,

---------------

 the first part after ATG (positions 1-3) is:

Original: TTTCTC (positions4-9:

---------------

 T T T C T C)

Mutant1: TTCTAC (positions4-9: T T C T A C )



---------------

So, comparing:

Position4: T (same)

Position5: T (same)

Position6: Original T vs Mutant1 C (

---------------

so position6: T to C?)

Position7: Original C vs Mutant1 T (position7: C vs T)

Position8: Original T vs Mutant1 A (position8: T vs

---------------

 A)

Position9: Original C vs Mutant1 C (same here)

Wait, so between original and mutant1, positions

---------------

6,7,8 are different. So multiple substitutions here?

Wait that's a problem. Because EMS typically induces point mutations (single base changes), but here

---------------

 the mutant1 has multiple changes in a row. Hmm, maybe the question's presentation is such that each mutant has a single change but the

---------------

 way the sequences are written might have a typo? Alternatively, perhaps the mutations are insertions or deletions? Wait, looking

---------------

 at the length:

Original's first part: Let's count the letters up to where the difference occurs.

Original's first part

---------------

 up to the first exon's start: Let me see. The first exon is the first exon, so the sequence given is

---------------

 the start. Let me count the letters in the mutant sequences to see if there's a frameshift or deletion.

Alternatively, maybe the

---------------

 mutations are presented as a few nucleotide changes, but the question states that they sequenced the gene and found changes in the first exon area. So

---------------

 perhaps each mutant has a different mutation, some substitutions, maybe a frameshift?

The question asks which mutation would eliminate the compound. To

---------------

 eliminate the compound, we need to stop the gene's function. So the best way is to have a mutation that introduces a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation), or disrupts the start

---------------

 codon, or causes a frameshift leading to a truncated protein.

Alternatively, a mutation that creates a stop codon early would be

---------------

 ideal. Let's look at each mutant's changes.

Let me go through each mutant one by one.

Mutant1:

Looking

---------------

 at the sequence changes. Let's see the first part. The first exon starts with ATG (start codon) followed by T

---------------

TTCTC... The mutant1's sequence after ATG is T T C T A C G C T... So positions

---------------

 4-9 (after the start codon):

Original: positions 4-9: T T T C T C (bases

---------------

 4-9 are T, T, T, C, T, C).

Mutant1: T T C T A C (so positions

---------------

4-6: T T C; position6 is C instead of T (position6). Then position7 is T (original was

---------------

 C?), wait no:

Wait let me get the exact letters again.

Original: positions 1-9 (after ATG):



---------------

Position1 (start codon is positions1-3: ATG). The first exon's first few nucleotides after the start cod

---------------

on (positions4 onwards):

Original:

4: T

5: T

6: T

7: C

8: T

9: C

Mutant1's sequence

---------------

 at these positions:

Position4: T (same)

5: T (same)

6: C (changed from T to C)

7: T (changed from C to T)

8: A (changed from T to A)

9: C (same as original)



---------------

So in mutant1, there are substitutions at positions6 (T→C), 7 (C→T), and 8 (T→A). So

---------------

 three base changes in a row here. That might be a stretch for a single EMS mutation, but maybe the question allows for

---------------

 multiple mutations? The problem states that they "discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area." So each

---------------

 mutant has some changes, possibly multiple. The question is which one would eliminate the compound.

Now, looking for which mutation would

---------------

 disrupt the gene's function. Let's see each mutant's possible effect.

Mutant1: The first exon's first cod

---------------

ons. The start codon is ATG (positions1-3). The next codons are:

Original:

After ATG (cod

---------------

on 1), the next codons would be:

Codon 2: positions4-6: TTT (le

---------------

ucine)

Codon3: positions7-9: CTC (leucine)

Codon4: positions10-12: GCT (alanine)

And

---------------

 so on.

Mutant1's sequence after the start codon:

Codon2: positions4-6: T T C → TTC (phenylalanine)



---------------

Codon3: positions7-9: T A C → TAC (tyrosine)

Wait, let's see

---------------

:

Mutant1's codons after the start:

Codon2 (positions4-6): T T C → TTC (F

---------------

)

Codon3 (positions7-9): T A C → TAC (T is position7, A is8, C is9 → TAC is

---------------

 tyrosine (TAC is Y))

So the first three codons are ATG, TTC, TAC. So

---------------

 that's a change from the original TTT (Leu) to TTC (still Leu? Wait no, TTT is P

---------------

he, wait wait, wait: TTT is phenylalanine (F), not leucine. Wait I think

---------------

 I made a mistake here.

Wait, codon TTT is phenylalanine (F), TCT is serine, etc. Let me correct

---------------

 that.

Original codons:

After ATG (start):

Codon2: positions4-6: TTT → F (phenylalanine)

Codon3: positions7-9: CTC → Leucine (CTC is L)

Codon4: positions10-12: GCT → Alanine (A)

So

---------------

 mutant1's codons:

Codon2: T T C (positions4-6: TTC → also phenylalanine (F),

---------------

 same as original. Wait, TTT and TTC are both F. So codon2 remains F.

Codon3: positions7-9: T (

---------------

7), A (8), C (9) → TAC, which is tyrosine (Y). Originally it was CTC (L). So changing

---------------

 from L to Y.

Codon4: positions10-12: GCT (original) → since the mutant

---------------

's next bases after position9 are GCT, so positions10-12 would be G C T → same as original,

---------------

 so codon4 is still A.

So in mutant1, the change is in codon3 from L to Y, and cod

---------------

on2 is unchanged (since TTC is still F). So this would result in an amino acid change (L to Y) but not

---------------

 necessarily a premature stop. So the protein would still be made, but with a different amino acid. That might reduce the function

---------------

 but not eliminate it. So this might not be the best option.

Moving to Mutant2:

Mutant2's sequence: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Original

---------------

 first part: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Compar

---------------

ing:

Original after ATG: TTTCTC GCTGGT...

Mutant2's sequence after ATG: TTCTAA GCTGGT...

So

---------------

 let's break down the differences:

Looking at positions4-12:

Original:

4:T,5:T,6:T,7:C,8:T,9:C,10:G,11:C,12:T



---------------

Mutant2:

4:T,5:T,C: T (position6?), then the next part: TAA GCT...



---------------

Wait let me parse the sequence properly.

Mutant2's first part:

After ATG (positions1-3), the next letters

---------------

 are T T C T A A G C T G G T A C T T...

So positions4-12:

Position

---------------

4: T (same as original)

Position5: T (same)

Position6: C (original T here → so

---------------

 position6 is changed from T to C?)

Wait, let me write it step by step:

Original:

Positions1-12:

---------------

 A T G T T T C T C G C T (positions4-12 are TTTCTC GCT →

---------------

 T (pos4), T(pos5), T(pos6), C(pos7), T(pos8), C(pos9), G(pos10), C(pos11), T(pos12).



---------------

Mutant2's first 12 bases after ATG:

Positions4-12:

T T C T A A G C T →

---------------

 so:

Position4: T (same)

5: T (same)

6: C (changed from T to C in

---------------

 original's position6?)

Wait original's position6 is T (since original's first 6 bases after ATG are TTT (

---------------

positions4-6 are T, T, T)), so position6 is T. In mutant2, position6 is C.

---------------

 So substitution at position6 (T→C). Then position7: T (original was C here?), no, original's position7 is C (since

---------------

 original's position7 is the 7th base after ATG, which is C (the first C in CTCG

---------------

CT...). Wait this is getting confusing. Let me see:

Wait, the original sequence after ATG is TTTCTC GCTGG

---------------

T... So positions4-6 are TTT (positions4-6: T, T, T). Then positions7-9: CTC (C, T, C). Then

---------------

 positions10-12: GCT (G, C, T). 

Mutant2's sequence after ATG is TT

---------------

CTAAGCTGGT... So positions4-12:

positions4-6: T T C (so position6 is C instead of T)



---------------

position7: T (originally C at position7?)

Wait, let's parse each base:

Mutant2's first 

---------------

12 nucleotides after ATG:

Positions4-12:

4: T

5: T

6: C (changed

---------------

 from T)

7: T (original was C here?)

Wait original's position7 was C (since original's 7th position

---------------

 after ATG is the first C in CTC...). So mutant2 has a T here. So position7: T instead of C.

position8: A (original was

---------------

 T at position8?)

Original's position8 is the second T in CTC (positions7-9: CTC → positions

---------------

7:C, 8:T, 9:C). So mutant2's position8 is A instead of T.

position9: A (original's

---------------

 position9 was C). So T at position9?

Wait, let's count each position step by step for mutant2:

After

---------------

 ATG (positions 1-3):

Position4: T (same as original)

Position5: T (same)

Position6: C (original was T)



---------------

Position7: T (original was C)

Position8: A (original was T)

Position9: A (original was C)

Position10: G (original was G)



---------------

Position11: C (original was C)

Position12: T (original was T)

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here, perhaps

---------------

 I should look at the codons.

Original codons after start:

Codon2 (positions4-6): TTT (F)

Codon3 (7-9): CTC (L)

Codon4 (10-12): GCT (A)

Mutant2's codons:

Codon2: positions4-6: T T C → TTC (still F)

Codon3: positions7-9: T (position7), A (8), A (9) → TAA.

---------------

 Oh! TAA is a stop codon. So in codon3, instead of CTC (L), it's TAA (stop). 



---------------

Ah! So this would introduce a premature stop codon right there. Because TAA is a stop. So the protein would be truncated after the second codon (F

---------------

), instead of continuing. So this mutation would result in a non-functional protein, which would prevent the anti-nutritional compound from being made. That sounds

---------------

 promising.

So Mutant2 has a stop codon early, which would likely eliminate the compound. Let me check the other options to be sure.

Mutant3:

Sequence

---------------

: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Original

---------------

's first part after ATG is TTTCTC GCTGGT...

Mutant3's sequence after ATG:

---------------

 TTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT...

Looking at the first part:

Original starts with TTTCTC (

---------------

positions4-9: TTTCTC).

Mutant3's sequence after ATG: T T T T A C G C T G

---------------

 G T...

Wait, let me parse this. 

Original's first 12 bases after ATG:

positions4-12: T T T C T C G C T (

---------------

so positions4-6: TTT, 7-9: CTC, 10-12: GCT).

Mutant3's first 12 bases

---------------

 after ATG:

positions4-12: T T T T A C G C T (so positions4-7: T T T T,

---------------

 then A C G C T...)

Wait, so:

Position4: T (same)

5: T (same)

6: T (same as original's

---------------

 position6)

7: T (original was C here (position7))

So position7 changed from C to T.

Position

---------------

8: A (original was T (position8))

Position9: C (original was C here (position9))

Wait

---------------

, let's see codons:

Codon2 (positions4-6): TTT (F, same as original)

Codon3: positions7-9: T (position7), A (position8), C (position9) → TAC (Y).

---------------

 

Original codon3 was CTC (L). So changing to TAC (Y) here.

Codon4: positions10-12: GCT (A

---------------

, same as original).

So mutant3 has a change in codon3 from L to Y. Similar to mutant1,

---------------

 but in a different way. This would be a missense mutation, altering the amino acid but not causing a stop. So the protein would still be produced, possibly

---------------

 with reduced function, but maybe not enough to stop the compound.

Wait, but looking further into the sequence of mutant3,

---------------

 the given sequence shows "GTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT..." which may have other changes. Wait the full sequence provided

---------------

 for mutant3 is:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Wait

---------------

, original after the first part was "GGTACTTCTGTGGATGAAC..." So in mutant3, after the initial changes

---------------

, there's a GTGTCA... which might indicate an insertion or a frameshift?

Wait, maybe I should check if

---------------

 there's a frameshift. Let me see:

Looking at the sequence after codon4 (position10-12:

---------------

 GCT (A)), then original's next codon would be positions13-15: GGT (G).

---------------

 

Mutant3's sequence after that: 

After GCT (positions10-12), the next bases are G T G T C A C T T C T G T G G A T...



---------------

Wait, let me check positions13-15: in original, positions13-15: GGT (G

---------------

). In mutant3, positions13-15: G T G → G (still G). But then the next

---------------

 part: the sequence has GTGTCA..., so maybe there's an insertion here? Let me see the exact letters.

Alternatively

---------------

, maybe there's a deletion or insertion causing a frameshift. Wait the mutant3's sequence after the first part is:



---------------

After ATGTTTTACGCTGGT (positions up to 15?), then GTCACTTCTGTGGAT...

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 there's a duplication or a deletion. Alternatively, perhaps a frameshift occurs because of an insertion or deletion of nucleotides. Wait

---------------

, but all the given mutations are substitutions? The question mentions EMS, which typically causes point mutations (single base substitutions). But

---------------

 looking at mutant3's sequence:

Original sequence after the start's first part:

Original: ...GCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant3's sequence:

---------------

 ...GCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Looking at the

---------------

 part after GCTGGT:

Original: ACTTCTGTGGATGAAC...

Mutant3: GTCACTTCTGTGGATGAAC...

Wait

---------------

, so after GCTGGT (positions10-15?), the original has ACT, and mutant3 has GTCA...

---------------

 So maybe there's an extra G or T inserted here, causing a frameshift? Let me count the bases.

Alternatively, perhaps a

---------------

 deletion or insertion. For example, if there's a deletion of a base here, leading to a frameshift. Let me see:

Original

---------------

: After GCTGGT (positions10-15: GCT GGT), then positions16-18: ACT (A),

---------------

 then TCT (S), etc.

In mutant3: After GCTGGT, the next is GTCA... which

---------------

 might be GTC A CT... So maybe an extra base inserted here? Like between the G and T, inserting a T? Not

---------------

 sure. Alternatively, maybe a deletion. 

Alternatively, maybe the mutation is a substitution leading to a frameshift? Wait, if

---------------

 in the first part, there was a substitution that causes a frameshift. Wait, but in the first few codons, mutant

---------------

3's codons up to codon4 are still in frame. The first three codons are:

ATG (start), TTT (F), TAC (Y), GCT (A). So

---------------

 codons are still in frame. The issue comes after. Wait, maybe there's a frameshift later on. Let me see further

---------------

 in the sequence.

But the problem states that the mutations are at the beginning of the gene's sequence in the first exon area. So perhaps the key

---------------

 is in the first few codons. Since mutant3's first few codons have a missense mutation (L to Y in

---------------

 codon3), but not a stop, it might not eliminate the compound.

Now looking at Mutant4:

Sequence:5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Comparing to original:

Original after

---------------

 ATG: TTTCTC GCTGGT...

Mutant4's sequence after ATG: TTTTAC GCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Let

---------------

 me break it down:

Original first part after ATG:

positions4-12: T T T C T C G C T (cod

---------------

ons TTT, CTC, GCT)

Mutant4's first part after ATG:

positions4-12: T T T T A C G C T A C T... Wait

---------------

, let's parse step by step.

Wait the mutant4's sequence is written as:

ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So after ATG,

---------------

 the sequence is TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Breaking down the first few bases:

Positions4-6: T T T (same

---------------

 as original's first three positions here (positions4-6: TTT))

Position7: T (original was C at position7)



---------------

Position8: A (original was T at position8)

Position9: C (original was C at position9)

Position

---------------

10: G (original's position10 was G, so same)

Position11: C (original's position11 was C)

Position12: T (original's position12 was T)

Wait, let

---------------

 me check codons:

Codon2 (positions4-6): TTT (F, same as original)

Codon3: positions7-9: T (position7), A (8), C (9) → TAC (Y,

---------------

 like mutant2 and 3)

Codon4: positions10-12: GCT (A, same as original)

So the

---------------

 first three codons are:

ATG (start), F (TTT), Y (TAC), A (GCT).

---------------

 So similar to mutant2 and 3, this is a missense mutation in codon3. But no stop codon here. 



---------------

But looking further, after codon4 (GCT), the next part in mutant4's sequence is ACTTCTGTGGAT...

---------------

 

Original's sequence after GCT (codon4) was GGT (codon5) then ACTTCTGT

---------------

GGAT...

Wait, original's codon5 (positions13-15): GGT (Gly). 



---------------

Mutant4's sequence after GCT (positions10-12: GCT) has next codons:

positions13-15: ACT

---------------

 (position13: A,14:C,15:T → ACT is threonine (T)) 

Original

---------------

 had GGT there. So codon5 is changed from G to T. 

So the mutation in codon5 would

---------------

 also be a missense. But again, not a stop.

However, maybe there's a frameshift here? Let me see.

---------------

 

Wait, in mutant4's sequence after the first exon's start, let's see the entire first part:

Mutant4's sequence after the first few codons is

---------------

 "TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT..."

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 there's a deletion here. Let's see:

Original sequence after the first codons:

After the start codon (positions1-3), the

---------------

 next is TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So the sequence after GCT (positions10-12: GCT) is

---------------

 GGT (positions13-15), then ACT (positions16-18), TCT (positions19-21), etc.

Mutant4's sequence after GCT (positions10-12: GCT) is ACT

---------------

 (positions13-15?), because the next letters are ACTTCTGTGGAT...

Wait, so in the original, after GCT (positions10-12) comes GGT (positions13-15).

---------------

 In mutant4, after GCT comes ACT (positions13-15: A, C, T). So there

---------------

's a substitution here (GGT → ACT), but the reading frame remains intact. So no frameshift here. 

Hmm

---------------

, so mutant4's codons up to there are still in frame, but with some amino acid changes. Not a stop codon.

---------------

 

Looking for a mutation that introduces a stop codon early would be the best option. Mutant2 has a stop codon in codon3 (TAA). That

---------------

 would truncate the protein early, so the gene product is non-functional, thus eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. 

Mut

---------------

ant1 and 3 and 4 have missense mutations but no stop. 

Wait, but what about frameshift mutations? For

---------------

 example, if there was a deletion or insertion causing a frameshift, leading to a premature stop. Let me check if any of the mutants have such

---------------

 a thing. 

Looking at mutant3's sequence: the given sequence shows "GTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT..." after

---------------

 some point. Let me see if there's an insertion or deletion causing a frameshift. For example, if there's an extra nucleotide,

---------------

 shifting the reading frame. 

Suppose in mutant3's sequence, after the first few codons, there's an insertion of

---------------

 a base. For instance, if there's an extra base inserted at position13, then the codons after that would shift. But

---------------

 the problem states that the mutations are in the first exon area, so maybe the key is in the initial part. 

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 mutant4 has a deletion. Looking at the sequence:

Original after ATGTTTTACGCTGGTACTT... Wait

---------------

, perhaps I should look for a frameshift in the beginning. 

Wait, let me look again at mutant3's first part. The

---------------

 original has TTTCTC (positions4-9), and mutant3 has TTTTAC (positions4-9:

---------------

 T T T T A C). That's 6 bases, so no frameshift. 

Mutant2 has TAA

---------------

 in codon3, which is a stop. That's the best option. 

So the answer is Mutant2 (Option A).

---------------

 

Wait the options are:

A) Mutant2

B) Mutant3

C) Mutant1

D) Mutant4

Yes, so the correct answer is A.


To determine which mutation eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we need a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, such as introducing a premature stop codon. Analyzing each mutant's sequence:

- **Mutant1** has

---------------

 substitutions in codons 2, 3, and 8, altering amino acids but not introducing a stop codon. This results in a miss

---------------

ense mutation but not a loss of function.
- **Mutant2** introduces a **TAA stop codon** in codon 3 (positions 7-9:

---------------

 TAA). This premature stop truncates the protein early, rendering it non-functional, which would eliminate the compound.
- **Mutant3** and **Mutant4** also have missense mutations but no stop codons. They

---------------

 alter amino acids but do not disrupt the gene's activity sufficiently.

The most effective mutation is **Mutant2**, as it introduces a premature stop codon, halting protein synthesis early and likely

---------------

 eliminating the compound.
