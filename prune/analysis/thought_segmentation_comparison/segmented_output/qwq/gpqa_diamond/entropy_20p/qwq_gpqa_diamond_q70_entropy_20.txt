Okay, so I have this question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is asking for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, given their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. All the

---------------

 planets have the same albedo. Hmm, right.

First, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on a

---------------

 few factors, like the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. Since they all have the same albedo, that part cancels out. The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T0 * (L/(4π

---------------

a²))^(1/4) * (1 - A)^(-1/4), where T0 is the temperature

---------------

 at 1 AU, L is the star's luminosity, and a is the orbital distance. Wait, but maybe there

---------------

's a simpler version when comparing two planets around the same star.

Oh right, if the star's luminosity is the same for all planets, then the equilibrium temperature ratio

---------------

 can be simplified using the inverse square root of their distances. Because the equilibrium temperature relation is T ∝ (L/(a²))^(1/4), assuming

---------------

 albedo and other factors are constant. Since L is the same, the ratio of temperatures would be proportional to (1/a)^(1/2), because

---------------

 (L/a²)^(1/4) is the same as (1/a)^0.5. Wait, let me check

---------------

 that again.

Let me recall the exact formula. The equilibrium temperature T is given by:

T = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ) * (L_star

---------------

 / L_sun )^(1/4) ... Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe the Stefan

---------------

-Boltzmann law comes into play here. The equilibrium temperature is proportional to (L/(16 π σ a² d

---------------

²))^(1/4), but perhaps an easier way is to use the formula T ∝ (L/(a²))^(1/4) *

---------------

 (1 - A)^(-1/4). Since A is the same for all planets, that term cancels when taking the ratio. So the

---------------

 key is the L/(a²) term. But since all planets orbit the same star, L is constant. So T ∝ 1/s

---------------

qrt(a). 

Wait, let me think again. Let me write the formula properly. The equilibrium temperature (assuming no atmosphere and so

---------------

 on) is given by:

T_eq = T_sun * sqrt( R_sun / (2 a) ) * (L_sun / L )^(1/4) ?



---------------

Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently. The standard formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T0 * ( (1 - A) )^(-1/4) * ( R^2 / (a^2) )^(1/4), where R is the star's radius and

---------------

 T0 is the star's effective temperature. But maybe even better, since they are all orbiting the same star, the ratio would depend

---------------

 only on their distances. 

Alternatively, the key point is that the equilibrium temperature depends on the inverse square root of the semi-major axis.

---------------

 Because the energy received is proportional to L/(4πa²), and then the temperature is proportional to the fourth root of that (

---------------

due to the Stefan-Boltzmann law). Wait, let me do the math step by step.

The energy flux (power

---------------

 per area) received by the planet is F = L / (4πa²). The planet's equilibrium temperature is determined

---------------

 by balancing incoming and outgoing radiation. Assuming the planet is a blackbody, the outgoing power is σT^4 * 4πr², where r is the planet's radius. The incoming power is F * πr² (since the cross-section area is πr²). Setting them equal:



---------------

σT^4 * 4πr² = (L/(4πa²)) * πr² 

Wait, simpl

---------------

ifying this:

Left side: σ T^4 * 4πr² 

Right side: (L/(4πa²)) * πr² = (L r²)/(4a²)

Set

---------------

 equal:

σ T^4 *4 π r² = L r²/(4 a²)

Cancel r² from both sides:

σ T^4 *4 π = L/(4 a²)

Solve for T^4:

T^4 = L / (4 π σ a² *

---------------

 16) ? Wait, let me re-calculate.

Wait, let me re-arrange properly. 

Starting

---------------

 over:

Energy in = Energy out

Energy in is F * (area of cross-section) = (L/(4πa²)) * πr² 

Energy out is σ T^4 * 4πr² (since

---------------

 the surface area is 4πr² and emissivity is 1 for a blackbody).

So:

(L/(4πa²)) * πr² = σ T^4 *4πr² 

Cancel

---------------

 πr² on both sides:

(L/(4a²)) = 4 π σ T^4 

Wait, no

---------------

. Let me see again. Left side after cancelling πr²: (L/(4a²)) 

Right side after cancelling πr²: σ T^4 *4π 

Wait, that

---------------

 would be:

(L/(4a²)) = σ T^4 *4π ?

Hmm, so solving for T^4:

T^4 = (L/(

---------------

4a²)) / (4 π σ) ) = L/(16 π σ a² )

So T = [ L/(16 π σ a² ) ]^(1/4 )

But

---------------

 since L, σ, π are constants for the star, the temperature is proportional to (1/a)^ (1/2).

---------------

 Because T ∝ (1/a^2)^(1/4) = 1/a^(1/2). So T ∝ 1/sqrt(a). 

So

---------------

 the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis. 

Therefore, to find the ratio between Planet 4 and Planet 2, we need the ratio of their distances

---------------

, then take the inverse square roots. 

But wait, the question gives orbital periods. We can use Kepler's third law to relate orbital period to semi-major axis. 

Kepler's third law states that (P^2)/(a^3) = (4π²)/(G(M_star)), so for

---------------

 a given star, P² ∝ a³. Therefore, a ∝ P^(2/3). 

So the

---------------

 semi-major axis is proportional to the orbital period raised to the 2/3 power. 

Therefore, the ratio of semi

---------------

-major axes between Planet 4 and Planet 2 is (P4/P2)^(2/3). 

Given the orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Let

---------------

 me see, the planets are labeled Planet_1 through Planet_5 with orbital periods in that order. So Planet_2 has a

---------------

 period of 2 (assuming the first is 1), Planet_4 has a period of 3.5. 

So P4/P2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75 

Thus

---------------

, a4/a2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3). 

Then the ratio of temperatures T4/T2 would be the

---------------

 inverse of the square root of that, because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). 

So T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2) = [ (a2/a4) ]^(1/2) = [ (P

---------------

2/P4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2) ) 

Wait, let me think again. 



---------------

Let me write:

Since a ∝ P^(2/3), then a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3)

Therefore

---------------

, the ratio of their distances is (3.5/2)^(2/3). 

The temperature ratio is inversely proportional to sqrt(a4/a2), so:

T4 / T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2) = [ (a2/a4) ]^(1/2) 

Which

---------------

 is equal to [ (P2/P4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2) = (P2/P4)^(1/3) 

Wait

---------------

, let me see:

Let me compute step by step. 

Let me let’s denote P2 = 2 units, P4 = 3.5 units. 

So

---------------

 a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3) 

Thus, the ratio of temperatures is T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2) = [ (a4/a2)^-1 ]^(1/2) = (a4/a2)^(-1/2) 

Which

---------------

 is [ (P4/P2)^(2/3) ]^(-1/2) 

Exponent: (2/3)*(-1/2) = -1/3 

Thus

---------------

, T4/T2 = (P4/P2)^(-1/3) 

Which is (3.5 / 2)^(-1/3) 

Alternatively

---------------

, (P2/P4)^(1/3) 

Because (3.5/2)^(-1/3) = (2/3.5)^(1/3) 

Yes

---------------

, exactly. So 2 divided by 3.5 is equal to 4/7 (since 2*2=4 and 3.5*2=7). 



---------------

So 2/3.5 = 4/7. 

So the ratio is (4/7)^(1/3). 

Hmm

---------------

, so I need to compute (4/7)^(1/3). 

Let me see, 4/7 is approximately 0.5714. 

The

---------------

 cube root of 0.5714. Let me think. 

Cube of 0.8 is 0.512 (0.8^3 = 0.512). 

Cube of 0.83 is 

---------------

0.83*0.83=0.6889, then *0.83 ≈ 0.5717. Oh wait

---------------

, that's exactly the value. 

Wait, 0.83^3 is approximately (0.8)^3 +

---------------

 some. Let me compute 0.83^3:

0.83 * 0.83 = 0.6889



---------------

Then 0.6889 * 0.83: 

0.6889 *0.8 = 0.55112



---------------

0.6889 *0.03 = 0.020667

Total is 

---------------

0.55112 + 0.020667 ≈ 0.5718. 

Which

---------------

 is very close to 0.5714 (which is 4/7). 

So 0.83^3 ≈ 0.5718, so cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83. 

Wait, but the

---------------

 question is asking T4/T2. Since (4/7)^(1/3) is approximately 0.83, so

---------------

 the ratio of Planet4's temperature to Planet2's is about 0.83? 

Wait but hold on. Let me check

---------------

 again. 

Wait, let me recap the steps to ensure I didn't mix up the planets. 

The question says the

---------------

 orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planet_1 to Planet_5. 

So Planet_2 has a

---------------

 period of 2 (since the second term is 2). 

Planet_4 is the fourth in the list, so its

---------------

 period is 3.5. 

Thus, P4 is 3.5, P2 is 2. 

So

---------------

 the ratio of their distances a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3) = (3.5/2)^(2/3). 

So

---------------

 the temperature ratio is T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2) = [ (P2/P4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2) 

Which

---------------

 is (P2/P4)^(1/3) 

Yes, because (2/3.5)^(2/3 * 1/2) = (2/3.5)^(1/3). 

So

---------------

 (2/3.5) is 0.5714, so taking the cube root gives approximately 0.83. 

So

---------------

 the ratio T4/T2 is approximately 0.83. 

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83. 

Wait, but wait

---------------

, the problem states that the planets are in orbital resonance. Does that affect anything? Hmm. Well, orbital resonance is about the ratio of their orbital periods being a

---------------

 ratio of small integers, but in this case their given ratios are 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, which may

---------------

 or may not be exact fractions. But the question gives the exact ratios, so we can proceed with those. 

Therefore, the answer should be C)

---------------

 ~0.83. 

Wait but wait, let me check my exponent steps again. 

Because the temperature is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). 

Since

---------------

 a ∝ P^(2/3), so sqrt(a) ∝ P^(1/3). 

Thus, 1/sqrt(a) ∝ P^(-1/3). 

Therefore, the temperature is proportional to P^(-1/3). 

So

---------------

 the ratio T4/T2 = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3) 

Which is (3.5/2)^(-1/3) 

Which

---------------

 is (3.5/2) to the power of -1/3. 

Yes, that's the same as (2/3.5)^(1/3). 

Which

---------------

 is the same as (4/7)^(1/3). 

So that calculation is correct. 

So the cube

---------------

 root of 4/7 is indeed approximately 0.83. 

So the correct answer is option C. 

Hmm

---------------

, but let me see the options again. The options are A) ~0.57, B) ~0.69, C) ~0.83, D) ~0.75. 

So

---------------

 0.83 is option C. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me see

---------------

 another way. 

Suppose we let the orbital period ratio be P4/P2 = 3.5/2 = 1.75. 

The

---------------

 distance ratio a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3). 

So (1.75)^(2/3). Let me compute that.

---------------

 

First, 1.75 is 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3). 

The

---------------

 cube root of (7/4)^2. 

Wait, (7/4)^2 = 49/16. The

---------------

 cube root of 49/16. 

Hmm, cube root of 49 is about 3.659, cube root of 16 is 

---------------

2.5198. 

So 3.659/2.5198 ≈ 1.452. So a4/a2 ≈ 1.452. 

Then

---------------

 the temperature ratio T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2) = 1/sqrt(1.452). 

What

---------------

's sqrt(1.452)? Approximately 1.205. So 1/1.205 ≈ 0.829. 



---------------

Yes, that's about 0.83. 

So that's correct. So the answer should be C. 

Wait

---------------

, but wait a second. The question says "equilibrium temperatures". Does the albedo affect it? The problem states they

---------------

 have the same albedo, so in the formula, (1 - A) is the same for both, so when taking the ratio, that

---------------

 term cancels. So yes, the calculation holds. 

Therefore, the correct answer is C.


To determine the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the relationship between orbital period and semi

---------------

-major axis from Kepler's third law (\(P^2 \propto a^3\)), and the temperature dependence on distance (\(T \propto 1/\sqrt{a}\)). 

1. **Orbital Periods**: Given

 \(P_4/P_2 = 3.5/2 = 1.75\).
2. **Semi-Major Axis Ratio**: \(a_4/a_2 \propto (P_4/P_2)^{2/3} = (1.75)^{2/3}\).
3. **Temperature Ratio**: Since \(T \propto 1/\sqrt{a}\), the

 temperature ratio is:
   \[
   \frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_4}\right)^{1/2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_4}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{3.5}\right)^{1/3}.
   \]
4. **Calculation**: \

(\frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7}\), so \(\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.83\).

Thus, the equilibrium temperature ratio \(

T_4/T_2\) is approximately 0.83.
