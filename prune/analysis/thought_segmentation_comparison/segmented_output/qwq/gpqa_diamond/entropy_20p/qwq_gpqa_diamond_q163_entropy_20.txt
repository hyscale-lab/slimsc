Okay, so I have this question here about binary star systems and their masses. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Both systems have eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. The radial velocity (RV) amplitudes are given for each system. 



---------------

First, I remember that in binary systems, the radial velocity curves can be used to determine the masses of the stars. The formula that

---------------

 relates the radial velocities to the masses probably comes from Kepler's third law. Right, Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis divided by the sum of the masses. Wait, but maybe

---------------

 there's a specific formula for the radial velocity amplitudes in terms of mass and period?

Let me think. The radial velocity amplitude

---------------

 of each star is related to their masses and the orbital period. The formula I recall is something like v = (2π a

---------------

 sin i)/(P), but since we're dealing with the ratio of masses, maybe the inclination angle (i) cancels out?

---------------

 Or perhaps the key is using the masses in terms of the velocity amplitudes. 

Oh right, the masses of the stars can be found using the radial

---------------

 velocity amplitudes and the orbital period. The formula for the mass of a star in a binary system is derived from Kepler's laws. The general

---------------

 formula for each star's mass is:

M₁ / M₂ = (v₂ / v₁) * (m₂ / m₁) ?

Wait, maybe I need to recall

---------------

 the exact relation. Let me think again. The total mass of the system (M_total) is given by:

(M1 + M2) = (a1 + a2)^3 * (2π / P)^2 * (1 / G)

But since

---------------

 the semi-major axes a1 and a2 are related to the velocities through their orbital motion. Alternatively, the radial velocity am

---------------

plitudes (K1 and K2) are related to the masses. The formula I might need is:

K1 = (v)

---------------

 * (M2 / (M1 + M2)) 

Wait, maybe another approach. The radial velocity semi-amplitude for each star is given by K1 and K2. The formula

---------------

 connecting these to the masses is:

K1 = (2π G / (P sqrt(G^3(M1 + M2)))) )

---------------

 ... Hmm, perhaps I should use the formula that relates the masses to the velocity amplitudes and the period.

Alternatively, there

---------------

's a formula that for a binary system, the masses can be found using:

M1 sin^3 i / (M1 + M2)^2 = K2^3 P / (2π G)

and

---------------

 similarly for M2. But since we are comparing the total masses, maybe we can find the ratio of (M1 + M2) between the two systems.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the ratio of the total masses can be found by considering the ratio of (K1*K2 * P^2) terms

---------------

?

Wait, perhaps using the formula for the mass function, but since we don't know the inclination angle, but maybe assuming

---------------

 that the inclination is the same for both systems? The question mentions that both systems exhibit eclipses, which implies that they are edge-on (i=90 degrees), so sin i =1. That's

---------------

 a good point. Eclipsing binaries are typically assumed to have i close to 90 degrees, so sin i =1. So

---------------

 maybe that allows us to compute the masses without the sin^3i term.

So let me try again. Let's denote

---------------

 the total mass as M = M1 + M2 for each system.

The radial velocity of each star is given by Kepler

---------------

's law. The velocity of star 1 (v1) is proportional to M2/(M1+M2), and similarly

---------------

 for star 2. The radial velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 are related by K1/K2 = M2/M1. Because

---------------

 the velocities are inversely proportional to the masses. Wait yes: since the two stars orbit around the center of mass, their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So K

---------------

1/K2 = M2/M1.

So in system_1, K1 is 10 km/s and K2 is 5 km/s. Therefore, M

---------------

2/M1 = K1/K2 = 10/5 = 2. So M2 = 2*M1. Therefore

---------------

, the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = M1 + 2M1 = 3M1. 



---------------

Similarly for system_2, K1 is 15 and K2 is 10, so M2/M1 = 15/10 = 1.5, so M2 = 1.5*M1. Total

---------------

 mass is M1 + 1.5 M1 = 2.5 M1. 

But wait, but this

---------------

 only gives the ratio of the masses in each system. But to find the total mass of each system, we need to relate

---------------

 them using Kepler's third law. Because the orbital period is given. 

Ah right, so the total mass of the system is

---------------

 related to the orbital period. The formula from Kepler's third law is:

P^2 = (4π²/G)(a^3/(M1 + M2))

But here

---------------

, since the radial velocities are given, we can combine the two. 

Alternatively, the formula that combines the velocity amplitudes and the period to

---------------

 get the total mass is:

(M1 + M2) = (K1^3 P^2)/(2 G π^2) * (some

---------------

 terms?)

Wait, perhaps a better way is to use the following approach. Let me recall the formula for the mass function,

---------------

 but since we can assume sin i =1, the mass function becomes the actual mass. 

The mass of each star can be found

---------------

 using the following:

M1 = (K2^3 P^2)/(2 π^3 G) * (some

---------------

 factor?)

Alternatively, let's use the formula for the total mass. 

The formula for the total mass (M) of a binary system in terms of the radial

---------------

 velocity amplitudes and the orbital period is:

M = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P^2 ) / ( 2 *

---------------

 G * π^2 * (1 + e)^3 )

But assuming circular orbit (e=0), and using the

---------------

 fact that K1 and K2 are the velocities. Wait, maybe another approach. Let me think of the velocities in terms of the orbit

---------------

.

The orbital period P is related to the velocities and the separation. 

The orbital period P = 2π a / v, where a is the semi-major axis and

---------------

 v is the orbital speed. But since it's a two-body system, the velocities of the two stars are v1 and v2, such

---------------

 that v1/a1 = v2/a2 = ω (angular velocity). 

Alternatively, the radial velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 are equal

---------------

 to v1 and v2 (since we are assuming sin i =1 because it's edge-on). 

The total mass M

---------------

 = M1 + M2. 

From Kepler's third law:

M = (4 π² / G) * (a^3) / P²

But the separation a is the sum of the semi-major axes of each star.

---------------

 Since the two stars orbit around the center of mass, a1 + a2 = a. 

Also, the velocities are related to the separation

---------------

 and period. The orbital speed of each star is v1 = 2π a1 / P and v2 = 2π a2 / P. 

The

---------------

 radial velocity amplitudes K1 = v1 and K2 = v2. 

The ratio of a1/a2 = M2/M1.

---------------

 Since the center of mass is located at a1*M1 = a2*M2. 

So, a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a,

---------------

 and a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) *a. 

Therefore, v1 = 2π a1 / P = 2π (M2/(M1 + M2)) a / P 



---------------

Similarly, v2 = 2π (M1/(M1 + M2)) a / P 

But the ratio

---------------

 of v1/v2 = (M2)/(M1) which matches what I had before (since K1/K2 = M2/M1). 

Now

---------------

, to find the total mass, let's see. Let's express M in terms of K1, K2, and P. 

We

---------------

 can write M = ( (v1 + v2)^3 * P^2 ) / ( 2 * G * π^2 ) ?



---------------

Wait, perhaps I need to substitute variables here. Let me see.

We can express M1 and M2 in terms of K1 and K2. Let

---------------

 me denote K1 = v1, K2 = v2. 

From above, v1 = 2π a1 / P,

---------------

 and v2 = 2π a2 / P. 

Also, a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a,

---------------

 where a is the total separation (a1 + a2). 

Let me try to express M in terms of v1, v2, and P. 

The

---------------

 total mass M is (4 π² a³)/(G P²). 

We can express a in terms of the velocities. 

Since

---------------

 a1 + a2 = a, and a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) a, so

---------------

 a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) a. 

The velocities v1 = 2π a1 / P =

---------------

 2π/(P) * (M2/(M + M2))? Wait, sorry, M is total mass.

---------------

 Let me use variables properly. Let me denote M = M1 + M2. 

So, v1 = (2 π / P) * (M

---------------

2 / M ) * a 

Similarly, v2 = (2 π / P) * (M1 / M ) * a 

Adding

---------------

 v1 and v2: v1 + v2 = (2 π / P) * ( (M2 + M1)/M ) * a 



---------------

But M2 + M1 = M, so v1 + v2 = (2 π a)/(P) 

Thus

---------------

, a = ( (v1 + v2) * P ) / ( 2 π ) 

Plugging back into the expression

---------------

 for M: 

M = (4 π² a³ )/( G P² ) 

Substituting a: 

M = (4 π² /

---------------

 (G P² )) * [ ( (v1 + v2) P / (2 π) )^3 ] 

Simplify this

---------------

:

= (4 π² / G P²) * ( (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π³) )

S

---------------

implify terms:

4 / 8 = 0.5, π² / π³ = 1/π, P^3 / P² = P,

---------------

 so:

= ( (v1 + v2)^3 P ) / (2 G π )

Thus, the total mass M is:



---------------

M = ( (v1 + v2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 G π ) 

Hmm, that

---------------

's an expression for the total mass in terms of the velocities and the period. 

Wait, but let me check the derivation

---------------

 again because maybe I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me see:

Let me compute a³:

a = (v1 + v2) * P / (2 π )



---------------

So a³ = ( (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π³ )

Then 

---------------

4 π² a³ / (G P²) = 4 π² * ( (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π³ ) ) / (G P² )

The

---------------

 numerator: 4/(8) = 0.5, π² / π³ = 1/π, and P^3 / P² = P. 

So numerator

---------------

 terms give (0.5 * (v1 + v2)^3 * P) / π 

Denominator is G. 

Thus

---------------

, altogether, 4 π² a³/(G P²) = ( (v1 + v2)^3 P ) / ( 2 G π )

So

---------------

 yes, that's correct. So the total mass M is equal to ( (v1 + v2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 G π )

Wait

---------------

, but that formula must have units. Since velocities are in km/s, and period in years, we might have to convert units,

---------------

 but since we are taking the ratio between the two systems, maybe the G and π will cancel out in the ratio. 

So

---------------

, the mass of system_1 divided by the mass of system_2 would be:

(M1_sys) / (M2_sys) = [ ( (v1_1 + v2_1)^3 * P1 ) / (2 G π) ] / [ ( (v1_2 + v2_2)^3 * P2 ) / (2 G π) ) ]

The 2 G π terms cancel, so:



---------------

= [ ( (v1_1 + v2_1)^3 * P1 ) / ( (v1_2 + v2_2)^3 * P2 ) ]

So

---------------

, that's the ratio of the masses. 

Now let's plug in the numbers. 

For system_1:

v1_

---------------

1 = 10 km/s, v2_1 =5 km/s → sum = 15 km/s



---------------

P1 = 2 years

For system_2:

v1_2 =15, v2_2 =10 → sum =25 km/s

P2 =1 year

So pl

---------------

ugging into the ratio:

( (15)^3 * 2 ) / ( (25)^3 * 1 ) 

Compute

---------------

 numerator: 15^3 = 3375, times 2 → 6750

Denominator: 25^3 = 15625, times 1 → 15625

So the ratio is 6750 / 15625 �

---------------

� let's compute that. 

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 6750/25 = 270, 15625/25=625. So 270/625.

---------------

 

270 divided by 625. Let me compute:

625 × 0.4 = 250 →

---------------

 270-250=20 → 0.4 + (20/625)= 0.4 + 0.032 = 0.432.

---------------

 So approximately 0.432. 

Hmm, so the ratio is about 0.43, which is closest

---------------

 to option A (0.4) or B (0.6). Wait, but the options are A ~0.4, B ~0.6. So

---------------

 0.43 is closer to 0.4. 

Wait, but let me check my calculations again. 



---------------

Wait 15^3 is 3375, 25^3 is 15625. 



---------------

So 3375 *2 = 6750. 

6750 divided by 15625.

---------------

 

Let me compute 15625 × 0.4 = 6250, subtract that from 6750:

---------------

 6750 -6250=500. 

So 0.4 + (500/15625). 

500/15625 = (500 ÷ 125)/(15625 ÷125) = 4/125 = 0.032. 

So total 0.432. So

---------------

 about 0.43. So that's option A, which is ~0.4. 

Wait, but the

---------------

 question says "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So if the ratio M1/M2 is ~0.43, that means system_1 is 

---------------

0.43 times as massive as system_2. Wait, but the question asks by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So

---------------

 if system_1 is less massive, then the factor would be less than 1, but the question might be phrased as "

---------------

more massive" so maybe I need to take reciprocal?

Wait, wait a second! Wait, the ratio I computed is (M1/M2) = 0.432. So

---------------

 that means system_1 is 0.43 times the mass of system_2. Therefore, system_1 is less massive. But the question asks by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So

---------------

 if it's 0.43 times, then the factor would be 0.43, so the answer would be A.

---------------

 But perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. 

Wait, let me check the formula again. 

The formula I used

---------------

 was M_sys1 / M_sys2 = [ (v1+ v2)_1^3 * P1 ] / [ (v1 + v2)_2^3 * P2 ]

Wait

---------------

, that's correct? Let me confirm the formula again. 

Yes, because the formula for the total mass is M = ( (v1 + v2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 G π ),

---------------

 so the ratio would be as I said. 

But let me think again. Suppose I have two systems. 

Let me take

---------------

 system_1:

sum_v1 =15, P1=2

sum_v2 =25, P2=1

So

---------------

 the ratio M1/M2 = (15/25)^3 * (2/1) = ( (15/25)^3 ) * 2



---------------

Wait, maybe I can write it as:

( (sum_v1 / sum_v2)^3 ) * ( P1 / P2 )

So

---------------

 ( (15/25)^3 )*(2/1) = ( (3/5)^3 ) *2 

(

---------------

27/125)*2 =54/125 = 0.432. 

Yes. So that

---------------

's correct. 

Therefore, the mass of system_1 is 0.432 times that of system_2. So

---------------

 system_1 is less massive than system_2. But the question asks "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So

---------------

 if it's 0.43 times, then the factor would be 0.43, so the answer is A.

---------------

 

Wait, but the options are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, etc. So the

---------------

 answer should be A. 

But let me check if I mixed up the ratio. Did I compute M1/M2 or M2/M1?

The

---------------

 question says "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So if M1 = 0.43*M

---------------

2, then the factor is 0.43, so the answer is A. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the formula.

---------------

 Let me think again. 

Wait, the formula is derived correctly? Let me check the formula again. 

Wait, the

---------------

 total mass M is proportional to (v_total)^3 * P. 

Wait, but let me think of units. Let

---------------

's see, if velocity is in km/s and period in years, the units would be inconsistent, but since we are taking the ratio, the constants (

---------------

like G and π) would cancel. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used another formula. Let me think again. 

Another

---------------

 approach: Kepler's third law in terms of the masses and the period. 

The formula is (M1 + M2) = (4 π² / (G P² )) * a³ 

The

---------------

 semi-major axis a is the sum of a1 and a2. 

But the radial velocities K1 and K2 are related to the velocities

---------------

. 

The velocity of each star is v1 = 2 π a1 / P 

v2 = 2 π a2 / P 

Therefore

---------------

, the ratio of a1/a2 = (v1/v2) 

Also, since a1 + a2 = a 



---------------

We can write a1 = (v1/(v1 + v2)) * a 

Similarly for a2. 

But

---------------

 perhaps it's better to express the total mass in terms of the velocities and period. 

Alternatively, let me think of the mass

---------------

 ratio. 

Let me denote for system 1: 

M1 = mass of first star 

M2 = mass of second star 

So

---------------

 their velocities K1 and K2 are related by K1/K2 = M2/M1. 

So for system_1, K1/K

---------------

2 = 10/5 = 2 = M2/M1 → M2 = 2 M1. 

So total mass M

---------------

_total1 = 3 M1 

Similarly for system_2: 

K1/K2 =15/10 = 1.5 = M2/M1 → M2 = 1.5 M1 



---------------

Total mass M_total2 = 2.5 M1 

Wait, but here M1 and M2 are the masses of the individual stars in each system. But

---------------

 when I write M_total1 =3 M1 (from system1's M1 and M2), and M_total2 =2.5 M1 (from

---------------

 system2's M1 and M2). But here the M1 in system1 and M1 in system2 are different variables. 



---------------

Ah, right! That's a mistake. 

So, perhaps I need to use variables for each system separately. 

Let me re

---------------

-define variables:

For system_1: 

Let m1 and m2 be the masses of the two stars. 

Their

---------------

 radial velocities are K1=10 and K2=5. 

So K1/K2 = m2/m1 = 10/5 =2 → m2 = 2 m1 

Total mass M

---------------

1_total = m1 + m2 = 3 m1 

For system_2: 

Let n1 and n2 be the masses. 

Their K1

---------------

=15, K2=10 → K1/K2 =15/10 =1.5 → n2/n1 =15/10 → n2 =1.5 n1 

Total mass M2_total = n1 +1

---------------

.5 n1 =2.5 n1 

Now, to find the ratio of M1_total / M2_total, we need to find (3 m1)/(2.5 n1 ).

---------------

 

But how do we relate m1 and n1? 

We can use Kepler's third law for each system. 

The

---------------

 orbital period is related to the total mass and the separation. 

But since the periods are different (2 years vs 1 year), we

---------------

 can write equations for each system. 

Let me use the formula derived earlier: 

M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 G π ) 

Wait, but

---------------

 I need to confirm that formula again. 

Alternatively, let me use the formula for the total mass in terms of the velocities

---------------

 and period. 

Assuming edge-on orbits (sin i=1), the formula for the total mass is: 

M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2 G π ) 

But

---------------

 let's see if this is correct. 

Wait, let me re-derive it properly. 

We have for each star:



---------------

v1 = 2 π a1 / P 

v2 = 2 π a2 / P 

Also, the

---------------

 center of mass condition: m1 a1 = m2 a2 → a1/a2 = m2/m1 

Total

---------------

 separation a = a1 + a2 

Express a1 = (m2/(m1 + m2)) * a 

a

---------------

2 = (m1/(m1 + m2)) * a 

So, substituting into v1: 

v1 = 2 π/(P) * (m2/(m1 + m2)) * a 

Similarly v2 = 2 π/(P) * (m1/(m1 + m2)) * a 

Adding

---------------

 v1 and v2: 

v1 + v2 = 2 π/(P) * ( (m2 + m1)/(m1 + m2) ) * a 

Which

---------------

 simplifies to (2 π a)/P 

So, a = (v1 + v2) * P/(2 π) 

Now

---------------

 plug into Kepler's third law: 

M_total = (4 π² a³)/(G P² ) 

Substitute a: 

M_total = (4 π² /

---------------

 (G P² )) * [ ( (v1 + v2) P/(2 π) )^3 ] 

=

---------------

 (4 π² / G P² ) * ( (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π³) )

Simplify:

---------------

 

4/(8) = 0.5, π² / π³ = 1/π, P^3/P² = P 

So,

---------------

 

M_total = ( (v1 + v2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 G π ) 

Yes, that's correct. 

Therefore, the total mass is

---------------

 proportional to (v_total)^3 * P, where v_total is the sum of the velocity amplitudes. 

So,

---------------

 for system_1:

M1_total = ( (10+5)^3 * 2 ) / (2 G π ) = (15^3 *2 )

---------------

/(2 G π )

Similarly, system_2:

M2_total = ( (15+10)^3 *1 )/(2 G π ) = (25^3 *1 )/(2 G π )

Therefore

---------------

, the ratio M1/M2 = (15^3 *2 ) / (25^3 *1 ) 

Which

---------------

 is exactly what I computed before, leading to ~0.43. 

So the answer is A, ~0.4. 

Wait

---------------

, but the options are given. The options are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, C) ~1.2, D) ~0.7. 

So

---------------

 the correct answer should be A. 

Wait, but the question says "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2". So

---------------

 since the ratio is 0.43, that means system_1 is 0.43 times as massive as system_2, so it's less massive. But

---------------

 the question is phrased as "more massive", so maybe I have to take the inverse? 

Wait, no. If

---------------

 system_1 is 0.43 times the mass of system_2, then system_1 is less massive. The

---------------

 question is asking "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So if it's less, the factor would be a fraction less than 1. The

---------------

 wording is a bit tricky. 

The question says "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So

---------------

 the factor is M1 / M2. Since that's ~0.43, the answer is A. 

Alternatively

---------------

, if the question had asked how much more massive system_2 is than system_1, it would be the inverse. But as

---------------

 written, it's M1/M2. 

Therefore the correct answer is A.


To determine the mass ratio between system_1 and system_2, we use the formula

---------------

 derived from Kepler's laws and radial velocity data. The total mass of a binary system is proportional to the cube of the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes multiplied by the orbital period. 

For system_1:
- Radial velocity amplitudes: \( K_1 = 10 \, \text{km/s} \), \( K_2 = 5 \, \text{km/s} \)
- Orbital period \( P_1 = 2 \, \text{years} \)
- Sum of velocities: \( K_1 + K_2 = 15 \, \text{km/s} \)

For system_2:
- Radial velocity amplitudes: \( K_1 = 15 \, \text{km/s} \), \( K_2 = 10 \, \text{km/s} \)
- Orbital period \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{year} \)
- Sum of velocities: \( K_1 + K_2 = 25 \, \text{km/s} \)

The mass ratio \( \frac{M_1}{M_2} \) is calculated as:
\[
\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{(15^3 \cdot 2)}{(25^3 \cdot 1)} = \frac{3375 \cdot 2}{15625} = \frac{6750}{15625} \approx 0.432
\]

This ratio

---------------

 indicates system_1 is approximately 0.43 times as massive as system_2. The closest option is **A) ~0.4**.

Answer: A<|im_end|>
