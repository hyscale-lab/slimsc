Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron and a positron colliding and annihilating into two photons. The question is asking for the angle between the directions of the two photons. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. Since the

---------------

 problem states there are two photons, each must have some direction and energy. The key points given are the Lorentz factors of the electron and positron, which are 4 and 2 respectively. Lore

---------------

ntz factor (γ) relates to their relativistic energy. The rest mass energy of an electron (and positron) is 511 keV. So their total energies can

---------------

 be calculated using E = γmc². 

Let me compute their energies first. For the electron moving left with γ=4, its energy is 4*(511 keV) = 2044 keV. The positron moving right has γ=2, so its energy is 2*(511 keV) = 1022 keV. Wait

---------------

, but since they are moving in opposite directions, their momenta will have opposite directions. 

The total momentum before collision must be conserved. The

---------------

 total energy will also be conserved. The photons, being massless, will carry momentum equal to E/c each, and their directions must be such that the total momentum is conserved. Since the problem says the photons have the same energy, that

---------------

 might help in figuring out the angles.

Hmm, the photons have the same energy. Let's denote each photon's energy as E_photon. Since energy is conserved, the sum of the two photon energies must equal the total energy of the electron and positron. So:



---------------

E_photon1 + E_photon2 = E_electron + E_positron

But since they have the same energy, that

---------------

's 2E_photon = (4 + 2)*511 keV. Wait, 4γ for

---------------

 electron and 2 for positron. Wait, no, the total energy is the sum of their individual energies. So 

---------------

4*511 + 2*511 = (6)(511) keV. Therefore, each photon has energy 3*511 keV = 1533 keV. Wait

---------------

, but 6 divided by 2 is 3, so yes, each photon has 3*511 keV. 



---------------

Now, the next part is about momentum conservation. The total momentum before collision must equal the total momentum after. Since photons are

---------------

 massless, their momentum is E/c, and direction matters. Let me think in terms of vectors.

Let's set up a coordinate system where the electron is moving along the positive x-axis (to

---------------

 the right?), but wait the problem says the electron is moving from the left, so perhaps the electron's direction is along the negative x-axis, and the positron from the right is along the positive x-axis. Wait, maybe

---------------

 I should define coordinates more precisely.

Let me define the electron's direction as the positive x-axis (since it's moving from left to right,

---------------

 but the problem says "horizontal axis from the left"—wait, actually, the problem says electron is moving along horizontal axis from the left, so maybe

---------------

 the electron is moving to the right (since from left side towards the center?), and the positron is moving from the right towards the center.

---------------

 Wait, but the problem says the positron is moving from the right, so its direction is to the left? Hmm, maybe

---------------

 I need to clarify the directions.

Wait, let's set up coordinates: Let's say the electron is moving along the positive x-direction (from left to right), and the positron is moving along the negative x-direction (from right to left). So

---------------

 their velocities are opposite. 

The total momentum before collision is the vector sum of their individual momenta. The electron's momentum is γm_e c (since p = γmv, but for

---------------

 relativistic particles, p = γ m v, but also p = γ m v = (E/c²) v. Alternatively, since

---------------

 E = γ m c², and p = E / c * β, where β = v/c. So the magnitude of momentum is p = γ m v. 



---------------

Wait, perhaps better to compute each momentum. Let me note that the momentum of the electron (moving right) is p_e = γ_e m_e v_e, and the positron's momentum is p_p = γ_p m_p v_p. But since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum would be in the negative x-direction. Wait

---------------

, but what's their velocity's magnitude?

Alternatively, since their Lorentz factors are given, and their direction is opposite, perhaps

---------------

 I can compute their momenta as vectors. Let me denote the electron's momentum as +p_e (positive x) and the positron's as -p_p (negative x). 



---------------

Wait, but the Lorentz factor γ is related to the velocity. The momentum p = γ m v. Since they

---------------

 are moving along the x-axis, their momenta are along that axis. So the total momentum before collision is p_e (electron) minus p_p (positron,

---------------

 since it's moving opposite). Wait, no—if the positron is moving in the negative x-direction, then its momentum is in the negative x-direction. So total momentum is p_e - p_p (if p

---------------

_e is electron's magnitude, and p_p is positron's magnitude). 

Wait, but to get the actual vector, the

---------------

 electron's momentum is +p_e (since moving right) and positron's is -p_p (moving left). So total initial momentum is p_e - p_p. 

The

---------------

 photons are emitted in directions upper-right and lower-right. So their momenta must be in those directions. Since photons travel at speed c, their momentum vectors are in the direction of travel, with magnitude E/c. 

The

---------------

 problem states that the photons have the same energy. Let me denote the energies as E1 and E2, both equal to E. So

---------------

 each photon has energy E, so their momenta are E/c each, but in different directions. Let me call the angles

---------------

 of the photons with respect to the x-axis. Since one is upper-right and the other lower-right, their angles are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. Let's say one makes an angle θ above the x-axis, the other θ below. So

---------------

 their momentum vectors would be at +θ and -θ from the x-axis. 

Therefore, the total momentum after collision is the vector sum of the two photon momenta. Since

---------------

 they are symmetric above and below, their vertical (y-axis) components will cancel out. The horizontal (x-axis) components will add up. 

The total momentum after collision must equal the total momentum before collision. 



---------------

So let's write equations. 

First, energy conservation:

Total energy before = (γ_e + γ_p) m_e c² = (4 + 2)*511 keV (since m_e and m_p have same mass). 



---------------

Total energy after is 2E = (4+2)*511, so E = 3*511 keV. That checks out.

Now momentum conservation. Let me compute

---------------

 the initial momentum. 

The momentum of the electron is p_e = γ_e m_e v_e. But since γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and

---------------

 p = γ m v. Alternatively, since E = γ m c², so p = (E)/(c²) * v. Hmm, perhaps it's better to compute p

---------------

 in terms of γ. 

Wait, the momentum can also be written as p = γ m v. But since γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²), where β = v/c. Alternatively

---------------

, another formula is p = sqrt( (E/c)^2 - (m c)^2 ). 

Wait, maybe using

---------------

 the relativistic momentum expression. For a particle with energy E, momentum p is given by p = sqrt( (E/c)^2 - (m c)^2 ). But since the

---------------

 electron and positron are moving at relativistic speeds, their momenta are significant. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the initial

---------------

 momentum as follows:

Electron's momentum: p_e = γ_e * m_e * v_e. 

But we need to express v_e in terms of γ_e. Since γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²), so β = v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). 

So β_e = sqrt(1 - 1/(4)^2) = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682. 

Thus

---------------

, v_e = β_e c. 

Therefore, p_e = γ_e * m_e * β_e c. 

But m

---------------

_e c² is the rest mass energy, 511 keV. Let me compute the momentum in terms of energy. 

Alternatively, since

---------------

 E = γ m c², so γ m c² = E, so p = γ m v = (E/c²) * v = (E/c²) * β c = (E β)/c. 

So p = (E β)/c. 

So for the electron, p_e = (E_e β_e)/c, where E_e is the electron's energy (4*511 keV). 

Similarly, the positron's momentum is p_p = (E_p β_p)/c. 

But the positron is moving in the opposite direction, so its momentum vector is -p_p (assuming

---------------

 direction is along the x-axis). 

Therefore, the total initial momentum is p_e - p_p. 

Wait, but the

---------------

 positron's velocity is in the opposite direction, so its β is negative? Wait no, β is a magnitude, but direction is accounted for in the sign. Let

---------------

 me clarify:

The electron's momentum is in the positive x-direction: p_e = (E_e β_e)/c.

---------------

 

The positron's momentum is in the negative x-direction: p_p = (E_p β_p)/c, but direction is negative. So total initial momentum is p_e - p_p. 

Wait, actually

---------------

, since E_p is the positron's energy (2*511 keV), and its velocity is in the opposite direction, so its β is the

---------------

 same magnitude as for the electron (but direction?), but actually, the positron's velocity's magnitude is determined by its own γ. 

Wait, the

---------------

 positron has γ_p = 2. So its β_p is sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866. 

Therefore, the electron's β_e is sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.968, and positron's β_p is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866. 

So pl

---------------

ugging in the numbers:

E_e = 4 * 511 keV = 2044 keV.



---------------

E_p = 2 * 511 keV = 1022 keV.

p_e = (2044 keV / c) * (sqrt(15)/4)

---------------

 

Wait, but units here might be tricky. Let me see if I can compute the actual momentum values in terms of units

---------------

 that will cancel when considering the angle.

Alternatively, let me compute the initial momentum components. 

Total initial momentum along x-axis is p_e (electron's momentum in +x) plus (-p_p) (positron's in -x). 

So total

---------------

 initial momentum P_initial_x = p_e - p_p. 

The total momentum after collision comes from the two photons. Since

---------------

 their y-components cancel, the total momentum after is the sum of the x-components of the two photons. 

Each photon has momentum magnitude

---------------

 p_photon = E/c. Since their angles are symmetric, the x-components of both photons will add. Let me denote the angle each photon makes with the x-axis as θ (one above, one below). Then, each photon's x-component is p_photon * cosθ, and their y-components are p_photon * sinθ and -p_photon * sinθ, which cancel. 

Therefore, total momentum after collision is 2 * p_photon * cosθ. 

Setting this equal to the initial momentum:

2 * (E_photon / c) * cosθ = p_e - p_p 

But E_photon is 3*511 keV, so substit

---------------

uting:

2 * (3*511 keV / c) * cosθ = p_e - p_p 

Now

---------------

, let's compute p_e and p_p. 

First, for the electron:

p_e = (E_e / c) * β_e 

Similarly

---------------

, p_p = (E_p / c) * β_p 

Therefore, substituting into the equation:

2*(3E_photon / c)*cosθ = (E_e β_e - E_p β_p)/c 

Wait, let

---------------

 me re-express the equation again. 

Wait, the left side is 2*(E_photon/c)*cosθ * 2? Wait no, wait

---------------

 the total momentum after is 2*(E_photon/c * cosθ). Wait, no, each photon contributes (E/c) * cosθ, so total

---------------

 x-momentum is 2*(E/c)*cosθ. 

The right side is p_e (from electron) minus p_p (since positron's momentum is opposite). 

Therefore:

2*(E_photon/c)*cosθ = p_e - p_p 

But

---------------

 p_e is (E_e/c)*β_e 

p_p is (E_p/c)*β_p 

So substituting:

2*(E_photon/c)*cosθ = (E_e β_e - E_p β_p)/c 

Multiply both sides by c:

2 E_photon cosθ = E_e β_e - E_p β_p 

Now plug in the numbers. 

First, E_photon is 3*511 keV. 

E_e = 4*511 keV, E_p = 2*511 keV.

β_e = sqrt(1 - 1/(4)^2) = sqrt(15/16) ≈ 0.9682.



---------------

β_p = sqrt(1 - 1/(2)^2) = sqrt(3/4) ≈ 0.8660.

So

---------------

 let's compute each term:

Left side: 2*(3*511) * cosθ 

Right side: (4*511 * 0.9682) - (2*511 * 0.8660)

Let me factor out 511 keV:

Left side: 2*3*511 * cosθ = 6*511 cosθ

Right side: 511 [4*0.9682 - 2*0.8660]

Compute the bracket:

4*0.9682 = 3.8728

2*0.8660 = 1.732

Subtract: 3.8728 - 1.732 = 2.1408

Therefore, right side is 511 * 2.1408

So equation becomes:

6*511 cosθ = 511 * 2.1408

Divide both sides by 511:

6 cosθ = 2.1408 

Therefore

---------------

, cosθ = 2.1408 /6 ≈ 0.3568 

Then θ = arccos(0.3568) 

Calculating that,

---------------

 let me see. Arccos of 0.3568. Let me compute that angle. 

Using a calculator: arccos(0.3568) is approximately 69 degrees (since cos(60)=0.5, cos(69)= ~

---------------

0.358, which is close to 0.3568). So θ ≈ 69 degrees. 

Wait, but

---------------

 the question is asking for the angle between the two photons. Since one is at +θ and the other at -θ, the angle between them is 2θ. 

So the angle between them is 2 * 69 ≈ 138 degrees. 

Looking at the options, option C is 138. 

Hmm, that seems to fit. Let me double-check my steps. 

First, the

---------------

 calculation of β_e and β_p: 

For γ=4, β_e = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) ≈ sqrt(0.9375) ≈ 0.9682. Correct.

For γ=2, β_p = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866. Correct.

Then

---------------

, E_photon is indeed (4+2)/2 *511 = 3*511. 

The momentum equation setup

---------------

: yes, the total initial momentum is p_e (electron's momentum in +x) minus p_p (positron's in -x direction, so subtracting).

---------------

 

The photons' total momentum is 2*(E_photon/c)*cosθ. 

Plugging the numbers in:



---------------

Right side: 4*511 * 0.9682 - 2*511 *0.8660

---------------

. 

Yes, that's (4*0.9682 - 2*0.8660)*511. 

Calculating 4*0.9682 gives

---------------

 3.8728, 2*0.866 is 1.732. Subtract

---------------

 gives 2.1408. 

Then 6 cosθ = 2.1408 → cosθ ≈ 0.3568 → θ ≈ 69°, so 2θ ≈ 138°, which is option C. 

I

---------------

 think that's correct. The angle between the two photons is 138 degrees. 

So the answer should be C.


The problem involves an electron and a positron annihilating into two photons with equal energy. Using conservation laws:

1. **Energy Conservation**: Total energy before annihilation equals the sum of the photon energies.
   - Electron energy: \(4 \times 511 \, \text{keV} = 2044 \, \text{keV}\).
   - Positron energy: \(2 \times 511 \, \text{keV} = 1022 \, \text{keV}\).
   - Total energy: \(2044 + 1022 = 3066 \, \text{keV}\).
   - Each photon energy: \(3066 / 2 = 1533 \, \text{keV}\).

2. **Momentum Conservation**: Total initial momentum equals the vector sum of photon momenta.
   - Electron momentum (\(p_e\)): \( \gamma_e m_e v_e = \frac{E_e \beta_e}{c} \).
   - Positron momentum (\(p_p\)): \( \gamma_p m_p v_p = \frac{E_p \beta_p}{c} \).
   - \(\beta_e = \sqrt{1 - (1/4)^2} = \sqrt{15}/4 \approx 0.9682\).
   - \(\beta_p = \sqrt{1 - (1/2)^2} = \sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.8660\).
   - Initial momentum: \(p_e - p_p = \frac{2044}{c} \times 0.9682 - \frac{1022}{c} \times 0.8660 = \frac{511}{c} \times (4 \times 0.9682 - 2 \times 0.8660) \approx \frac{511}{c} \times 2.1408\).

3. **Photon Momentum**:
   - Each photon momentum magnitude: \( \frac{1533}{c} \).
   - Photon

---------------

 angles symmetric about the x-axis (\(\theta\) above and below).
   - Total x-component: \(2 \times \frac{1533}{c} \cos\theta\).

4. **Equating Momenta**:
   - \(2 \times \frac{1533}{c} \cos\theta = \frac{511}{c} \times 2.1408\).
   - Solving: \( \cos\theta = \frac{2.1408}{6} \approx 0.3568 \Rightarrow \theta \approx 69^\circ \).
   - Angle between photons: \(2\theta \approx 138^\circ\).
