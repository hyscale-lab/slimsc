Okay, so I have this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with CMB photons creating electron-positron pairs. The question is asking at what energy the gamma rays would have their lifetimes limited by this process. The given average photon energy of the CMB is 10^-3 eV. The options are all in GeV, which is way higher than the CMB photon energy. Hmm, right, I remember that for pair production,

---------------

 there's a threshold condition.

First, pair production via gamma-gamma collisions requires that the energy of the two photons together is at least the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair. The rest mass energy of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, so the total energy needed is twice that, since

---------------

 you need two electrons? Wait, no, actually the rest mass energy for each is 0.511 MeV, so the total rest

---------------

 mass is 1.022 MeV. But in pair production, the two photons must have enough energy to create the pair. But

---------------

 since the gamma rays are high energy, and the CMB photon is low energy, I think the threshold condition here would be that the sum of their energies (

---------------

in the center-of-momentum frame) must be at least 1.022 MeV. 

Wait, but how

---------------

 does the energy of each photon contribute here? Let me think. The process is gamma (high energy) plus a CMB photon (low energy) annihilating into an electron-positron pair. So, the total energy in the center of mass frame has to be at least the rest mass energy. 



---------------

Alternatively, the threshold condition is when the product of their energies times the square of the speed of light equals the rest mass energy squared. Wait, maybe it's better to recall the formula for pair production via two photons. 

The threshold

---------------

 condition for pair production (gamma + photon -> e+ + e-) requires that the product of their energies (in some units) must

---------------

 satisfy a certain condition. Let me see. Let me think in terms of energy and momentum. 

The two photons must have enough energy so

---------------

 that when they collide, their total energy in the center of mass frame is at least 2m_e c^2 (since they

---------------

 need to create two particles each with mass m_e). Since photons have energy E = pc (since they are massless), their momenta are E

---------------

/c. 

Let me denote the high energy gamma photon as having energy E1 and the CMB photon as E2. The

---------------

 total energy in the center of mass frame would be sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (E1/c)^

---------------

2 + (E2/c)^2 ) * c^4 ), but wait, actually, the invariant quantity for two photons is (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (E1/c)(c)^2 +

---------------

 (E2/c)(c)^2 )^2? Wait, maybe I need to use the formula for the invariant s parameter

---------------

, which is (p1 + p2)^2. 

Alternatively, the total energy squared in the center of mass frame is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Since photons

---------------

 have p = E/(c), so p1c = E1 and p2c = E2. Therefore, the invariant is (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 + E2)^2 cos

---------------

(theta), where theta is the angle between the two photons. Wait, that's getting complicated. But at threshold, the process

---------------

 can only just occur, so the minimum energy required would correspond to when the photons are moving in opposite directions (theta = 180 degrees?), so their momenta are

---------------

 opposite. Wait, but maybe the threshold is when the photons are moving in the same direction? Hmm, I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 the threshold condition is when the product of their energies (in units where c=1) is equal to (m_e c^2)^2. Let me check that

---------------

. 

Wait, in pair production via two photons, the threshold condition is that the product of their energies (in the same

---------------

 units as m_e c^2) must be at least (m_e c^2)^2 divided by something? Wait

---------------

, perhaps the formula is that the minimum energy required is when the two photons are collinear, so that their momenta add up. Wait

---------------

, maybe I need to think in terms of the threshold condition for pair production. 

Alternatively, the threshold condition occurs when the two

---------------

 photons are moving in opposite directions, so their momenta cancel. Wait, perhaps the threshold is when the sum of their energies is exactly

---------------

 2m_e c^2. Wait, but then that would require that E1 + E2 >= 2m_e c^2. But since

---------------

 the CMB photon is only 1e-3 eV, which is way smaller than the 1 MeV needed, then

---------------

 the gamma photon would need to have energy around 1 MeV? But the options are in GeV, so that can't be. Wait

---------------

, there's a misunderstanding here. 

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the process in the center of momentum frame. Let

---------------

 me recall that in pair production via two photons, the threshold condition is when the sum of their energies is equal to the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair (since

---------------

 they must have at least that much energy to create the rest mass). Wait, but the rest mass energy for the pair is 2*(0.511 MeV) = 1.022 MeV. So E

---------------

1 + E2 >= 1.022 MeV. 

But the CMB photon has E2 = 1e-3 eV. Then E1 must be at least (1.022 MeV - 1e-3 eV). But 1e-3 eV is negligible compared to MeV, so approximately

---------------

 E1 must be at least 1.022 MeV. But the options are in GeV, which are way

---------------

 higher. That suggests I'm missing something here. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the CMB photon's energy is much

---------------

 smaller than the gamma-ray's, so the threshold condition is when the gamma's energy times the CMB photon's energy (

---------------

in some units) meets the threshold. Maybe I need to use the relation where the product of their energies must be above a certain threshold. 

Let

---------------

 me look up the formula for photon-photon pair production. The threshold occurs when the product of the two photon energies (in units of e

---------------

V) multiplied by c^4 equals (m_e c^2)^2. Wait, perhaps the condition is that the product of their energies (in e

---------------

V) must be greater than or equal to (m_e c^2)^2. 

Wait, here's a formula

---------------

: For two photons with energies E1 and E2, the condition for pair production is that E1*E2 ≥ (m_e c^2)^2 / (4

---------------

). Because when they are moving in opposite directions, the threshold is when their momenta are opposite. Let me see. 

The

---------------

 invariant s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. But since photons have E = p c, so p1 c = E1 and p2 c = E2. So

---------------

 s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 + E2)^2 cos(theta), where theta is the angle between them. At

---------------

 threshold, s must equal (2 m_e c^2)^2. Because the invariant mass squared is (2 m_e c^2)^2. 

The

---------------

 minimum energy occurs when the photons are moving in opposite directions (theta = 180 degrees), so cos(theta) = -1. Then s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = 4 E1 E2. 

Setting this equal to (2 m_e c^2)^2 gives 4 E1 E2 = (2 m_e c^2)^2 → E1 E2 = (m_e c^2)^2. 

Ah, so that's the key! So the product of the energies of the two photons must be at least (m_e c^2)^2. 

Since the

---------------

 CMB photon has energy E2 = 1e-3 eV, then E1 must be at least ( (0.511 MeV)^2 ) / (1e-3 eV) ). 

Wait, let's compute that. 

First, m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV, so squared is (0.511 MeV)^2. 

But

---------------

 E2 is 1e-3 eV. So:

E1 >= ( (0.511 MeV)^2 ) / (1e-3 eV )

But

---------------

 we need to convert MeV to eV to make units consistent. 

0.511 MeV = 0.511 × 1e6 eV. 

So (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) 

=

---------------

 (0.511^2 * 1e12 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) 

= 0.511² * 1e15 eV 

≈

---------------

 (0.261) * 1e15 eV 

≈ 2.61e14 eV 

Convert eV to GeV: 1 GeV = 1e9 eV. 

So 2.61e14 eV / 1e9 eV/GeV = 2.61e5 GeV. 

So

---------------

 that's 2.6 × 10^5 GeV. Which is option C. 

Wait, let me check again. Let's do

---------------

 the calculation step by step. 

m_e c² = 0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV. 

So

---------------

 (m_e c²)^2 = (511,000 eV)^2 = (5.11e5 eV)^2 = 2.61e11 (eV)^2. 

Div

---------------

ide that by E2 = 1e-3 eV: 

2.61e11 eV² / (1e-3 eV) = 2.61e14 eV. 

Convert

---------------

 eV to GeV: 

1 GeV = 1e9 eV, so 2.61e14 eV / 1e9 eV/GeV = 2.61e5 GeV. 

So yes, that's exactly option C. 

Therefore, the correct answer is C) 2.6*1e5 GeV.


To determine the energy threshold for gamma-rays to annihilate with CMB photons into electron-positron pairs, we use the threshold condition for pair production via photon-photon collisions. The invariant mass squared of the system must be at least the square of the electron-positron rest mass:

\[
s = (E_1 + E_2)^2 - (E_1 - E_2)^2 = 4E_1E_2 \geq (2m_e c^2)^2
\]

At threshold, equality holds: \(4E_1E_2 = (2m_e c^2)^2\), simplifying to \(E_1E_2 = (m_e c^2)^2\). Here

---------------

, \(E_2 = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}\) (CMB photon energy) and \(m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 511,000 \, \text{eV}\). Plugging in values:

\[
E_1 = \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_2} = \frac{(511,000 \, \text{eV})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = \frac{2.61 \times 10^{11} \, \text{eV}^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}
\]

Converting to GeV (\(1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}\)):

\[
E_1 = \frac{2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}}{10^9 \, \text{eV/GeV}} = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}
\]

This matches option C.
