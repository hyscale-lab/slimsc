Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the mean decay distance of a meson resonance, X. The given values are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four

---------------

 different distances, all in meters with exponents like 10^-15 or 10^-16. I need to figure out which one is the right answer. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about particle physics and decay distances.

First, the mean decay distance,

---------------

 I think, is related to how long the particle travels before it decays. Since particles can move at relativistic speeds, their

---------------

 lifetime is dilated, so I might need to consider the lifetime in the lab frame and then multiply by the speed to get the distance. But

---------------

 wait, the lifetime in the rest frame is connected to the decay width. Oh right, the relation between the width Γ and the lifetime τ is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But then

---------------

, in the lab frame, the lifetime would be longer due to time dilation. 

The production energy here is given as 8 GeV. Wait, is

---------------

 that the total energy of the particle? So maybe I need to find the Lorentz factor gamma, which is E divided

---------------

 by the rest mass. Let me write that down. The total energy E is γ m_X c². So γ = E / (m_X c²). Then

---------------

, the lifetime in the lab frame would be γ times the proper lifetime τ. So τ_lab = γ τ. Then, the mean decay distance would be the speed multiplied by τ_lab. But what's the speed here?

Alternatively

---------------

, maybe the velocity can be calculated using the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The momentum p is sqrt(E² - (m_X c²)^2)/c. Since

---------------

 E is given as 8 GeV, and m_X is 1.2 GeV/c²? Wait, units

---------------

 might be a bit tricky here. Let me check units. The mass m_X is given in GeV, but probably Ge

---------------

V/c². The production energy E_X is 8 GeV (which would be energy, so units of GeV). The width Γ is in MeV. So,

---------------

 assuming standard units here.

Let me structure the steps:

1. Calculate the proper lifetime τ = ħ / Γ. But �

---------------

� is the reduced Planck constant. Wait, but in particle physics units, sometimes they use natural units where ħ = c = 1, so the

---------------

 units might be in terms of GeV and seconds. Hmm, maybe I need to use the relation correctly with units.

Alternatively, the

---------------

 formula for mean decay distance might have a standard form. Let me recall the formula. The mean decay distance is given by:



---------------

d = (c * τ) * γ,

since γ is the Lorentz factor, so the lab frame lifetime is γ τ. Then

---------------

 the distance is (c γ τ). 

But τ is the proper lifetime, which is τ = ħ/(Γ). However

---------------

, in natural units where ħ = 1, but here we need to use the actual value. Wait, perhaps I

---------------

 should use the relation in terms of seconds. Let me think in terms of SI units.

First, let's convert all the given quantities into SI units.

---------------

 Let's see:

Γ_X is 320 MeV. Since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 1 MeV = 1.602e-13 J. Γ

---------------

 is in energy units, so Γ_X = 320e6 eV. So in joules, that's 320e6 * 1.602e-19 = 320e6 * 1.602e-19 J. But

---------------

 perhaps instead of dealing with SI units directly, there might be a more straightforward way.

Alternatively, I remember that in particle physics, the lifetime τ is related to the width by τ = (ħ c)/(Γ), but I

---------------

 might be mixing units here. Wait, let's get the units right.

The natural units often used in particle physics set ħ = c = 1 (in units of eV·s and m

---------------

/s respectively), so that energy and mass have units of eV, and length is in units of eV⁻¹ multiplied

---------------

 by ħ c. The lifetime τ (in seconds) can be related to Γ (in eV) via τ = ħ/(Γ). Since

---------------

 ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s, but in eV·s units, ħ is about 6.582e-16 eV·s. Therefore, τ (in seconds) = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (Γ in eV). 

Wait, Γ

---------------

 is given in MeV, so first convert Γ to eV. Γ_X = 320 MeV = 320e6 eV. Therefore τ = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (320e6 eV) = 6.582e-16 / 3.2e8 s. Let me compute that:

6.582 / 3.2 is approximately 2.057, so 2.057e-16 / 1e8? Wait, 6.582e-16 divided by 3.2e8 is 6.582/(3.2) * 1e-24? Wait, 

---------------

1e-16 divided by 1e8 is 1e-24? Wait, no, 320e6 is 3.2e8, so 

---------------

6.582e-16 divided by 3.2e8 equals (6.582/3.2) * 1e-24. Let

---------------

's compute 6.582 / 3.2 ≈ 2.057, so 2.057e-24 seconds? Wait that can't be right. Wait, 

---------------

6.582e-16 divided by 3.2e8 is 6.582 / 3.2 = ~2.057, then

---------------

 1e-16 / 1e8 = 1e-24. So yes, so τ ≈ 2.057e-24 seconds? Hmm, that seems very short. But maybe

---------------

 that's correct.

Wait, but let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let me see

---------------

 another approach. The relation τ = ħ/(Γ). Γ is given in MeV. Let me recall that 1 Me

---------------

V is 1e6 eV, so Γ in eV is 320e6 eV. Then

---------------

, τ in seconds is (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (320e6 eV) = 6.582e-16/(3.2e8) s. Let

---------------

's compute that:

6.582e-16 divided by 3.2e8 is (6.582 /3.2) * 1e-24. 6.582 divided by 3.2 is approximately

---------------

 2.057, so τ ≈ 2.057e-24 seconds. That seems really

---------------

 small, but maybe correct? Let's see, for example, the lifetime of a tau lepton is about 2.9e-13 seconds, which is way longer. But maybe

---------------

 this is a resonance with a very short lifetime. Since the width is 320 MeV, which is a large width, implying

---------------

 a short lifetime.

Okay, so τ ≈ 2.057e-24 seconds. Now, the

---------------

 proper lifetime is τ, and the lab frame lifetime is γ τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor γ is given by E/(m c²). Here, E is the total energy of the particle, which is given as 8 GeV. The mass m is 1.2 GeV/c². So,

---------------

 γ = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV/c² * c²) )? Wait, no

---------------

, more precisely, E = γ m c². So γ = E/(m c²). But since E is in GeV, and m c² is also in GeV (since m is given in GeV/c²,

---------------

 so m c² is GeV), so γ = 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666..., so approximately 6.6667.

Therefore, the lab frame lifetime τ_lab = γ τ = 6.6667 * 2.057e-24 s. Let me calculate that:

6.6667 * 2.057 ≈ 13.72 (

---------------

since 6 * 2.057 is 12.34, plus 0.6667*2.057≈1.37,

---------------

 so total ~13.71). So τ_lab ≈ 1.371e-23 seconds?

Wait, 

---------------

6.6667 * 2.057 is approximately 13.71, so 13.71e-24 s

---------------

 is 1.371e-23 s. Hmm, okay. Then the mean decay distance is c multiplied by τ_lab. The

---------------

 speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So:

d = c * τ_lab = 3e8 m/s * 1.371e-23 s ≈ 4.113e-15 m. Wait, that's 

---------------

4.11e-15 meters. Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 and option C is 5.02e-15. Close to B?

---------------

 But maybe my calculation has some errors in approximations.

Wait, let me check the steps again more precisely.

First, Γ

---------------

_X is 320 MeV = 320 * 1e6 eV = 3.2e8 eV.

The

---------------

 proper lifetime τ = ħ/(Γ). The value of ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s, but in

---------------

 eV·s, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so ħ in eV·s is (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ) ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So τ = 6.582e-16 eV·s / (3.2e8 eV) = 6.582 / 3.2e8 * 1e-16 /

---------------

 1e0? Wait, no. Wait, 3.2e8 eV is the denominator. So:



---------------

τ = (6.582e-16) / (3.2e8) seconds. Let's compute that

---------------

:

6.582 divided by 3.2 is approximately 2.056875. So 2.056875e-24 seconds. So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

Then γ is 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 ≈ 6.666666...

So τ_lab = γ * τ ≈ 6.666666 * 2.056875e-24 s

---------------

.

Let me calculate that precisely:

6.666666 * 2.056875 = ?

Let

---------------

 me compute 2.056875 * 6 = 12.34125

Then, 2.056875 * 0.666666 ≈ 2.056875 * (2/3) ≈ (2.056875 * 2)/3 ≈ 4.11375 /3 ≈ 1.37125

So total is 12.34125 + 1.37125 = 13.7125. So τ_lab = 13.7125e-24 s = 1.37125e-23 s.

Then d = c * τ_lab. c is 3e8 m/s.

So 3e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s = 3 * 1.37125e-15 m.

---------------

 Let's compute that:

3 * 1.37125 = 4.11375. So d

---------------

 ≈4.11375e-15 meters. Hmm, so that's approximately 4.11e-15 m. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 and C is 5.02e-15. So

---------------

 my calculation gives about 4.11e-15, which is closer to B but not exactly. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps?

Alternatively, perhaps I messed

---------------

 up the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the velocity when calculating the distance. Because the particle

---------------

 is moving at relativistic speeds, so the distance is c * τ_lab, which is correct. Alternatively, maybe the speed

---------------

 isn't exactly c? Wait, but for a meson with energy much larger than its mass, the speed is very close to c, so approx

---------------

imating it as c is okay. So that's probably not the issue.

Alternatively, maybe the formula for the mean decay distance is different. Let me check another approach. 



---------------

Alternatively, the mean decay distance can be calculated via the formula:

d = (ħ c) / (Γ) * (E/m)^

---------------

2 * (1/(sqrt(1 - (m²/E²))))

Wait, maybe there's another way. Let me think.

---------------

 The proper decay length is c * τ, which is c * (ħ/(Γ)). But in the lab frame, the

---------------

 lifetime is gamma times that, so the decay distance is c * gamma * (ħ/(Γ)). So the same as before. So that

---------------

 gives the same result.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in units somewhere. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, let

---------------

's recalculate τ:

τ = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (320e6 eV) 

Yes

---------------

, 320e6 eV is 3.2e8 eV. So 6.582e-16 divided by 3.2e8 is

---------------

 6.582/(3.2) * 1e-24. 6.582 divided by 3.2 is indeed

---------------

 approximately 2.056875, so τ is 2.056875e-24 s. That

---------------

's correct.

Gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 2.666..., wait no, 8 divided by 1.2. 8/1.2 is 6.666..., yes

---------------

. So gamma is correct.

So the product gamma * tau is 6.666666 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.37125e-23 s. Multiply by c (

---------------

3e8 m/s):

1.37125e-23 * 3e8 = 4.11375e-15 m. So that

---------------

's about 4.11e-15 m. The closest option is B, which is 4.0655e-15. Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 the exact calculation would give a slightly different result. Let me check with more precise numbers.

Let me use more precise values for constants. The value of ħ is exactly 1.054571800e-34 J·s. Let

---------------

's compute ħ in eV·s:

1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J, so ħ in

---------------

 eV·s is (1.0545718e-34) / (1.602176634e-19) ≈ 6.5822819e

---------------

-16 eV·s.

So let's use that exact value:

τ = 6.5822819e-16 / (320e6) 

Wait, 320 MeV is 320e6 eV. So τ

---------------

 is:

6.5822819e-16 / (3.2e8) = 6.5822819 / 3.2 * 1e-24.



---------------

6.5822819 divided by 3.2: 

3.2 * 2 = 6.4, so 6.5822819 - 6.4 = 0.1822819. 

0.1822819 /3.2 ≈ 0.056962. 

So total is 2.056962...

---------------

 So τ ≈ 2.05696e-24 s.

Gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666...

Multiply 

---------------

2.05696e-24 * 6.666666 = let's calculate this

---------------

 precisely.

2.05696 * 6.666666:

2 * 6.666666 = 13.333332

0.05696 * 6.666666 ≈ 0.05696 * 6 + 0.05696 * 0.666666

0.05696*6 = 0.34176

0.05696 * 0.666666 ≈ 0.03797

Total �

---------------

� 0.34176 + 0.03797 ≈ 0.37973

So total is

---------------

 13.333332 + 0.37973 ≈ 13.71306.



---------------

Thus τ_lab = 13.71306e-24 s = 1.371306e-23 s.

Multiply by c (3e8 m/s):

1.371306e-23 * 3e8 = 4.113918e-15 m. So approximately 4.1139e-15 m. 



---------------

Hmm, the options are B (4.0655e-15) and C (5.02e-15). The

---------------

 calculated value is around 4.11e-15, which is closer to B but not exactly matching. Maybe there's another factor I'm missing?

Wait, maybe I made

---------------

 an error in the Lorentz factor. Let me recalculate gamma again. 

Gamma is E/(m c²). The

---------------

 energy E is 8 GeV, the mass m c² is 1.2 GeV. So yes, 8 /1.2 = 6.666..., correct. 

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider the velocity in

---------------

 the calculation of the distance. Wait, the distance is the speed multiplied by the lifetime. The speed v is (p)/

---------------

E * c, where p is the momentum. Let me see if using v instead of c makes a difference. Because for

---------------

 a particle with energy much larger than its mass, the speed is nearly c, but maybe the exact value is needed here?

Let me try that. Let's compute the velocity v

---------------

. 

The energy is E = gamma m c² =8 GeV.

The momentum p = sqrt( (E)^2 - (m c²)^2 ) / c. 

So p = sqrt( (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 ) GeV/c.

---------------

 

Calculating inside the sqrt: 64 - 1.44 = 62.56. So sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV/c. 

Thus p = 7.91 GeV/c. 

Then the velocity v is (pc)/E. 

pc

---------------

 is 7.91 GeV/c * c =7.91 GeV. 

So v = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) = 0.98875 c. 

So v is approximately 0.98875 times the speed of light. 

Therefore, the actual

---------------

 speed is 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s. 

Wait

---------------

, so using v instead of c would give a slightly shorter distance. Let's recalculate the distance with v.

d = v * τ_lab = (0.98875 c) * τ_lab. 

Earlier

---------------

, we had τ_lab = 1.3713e-23 s. 

So d = 0.98875 * 3e8 * 1.3713e-23 = 0.98875 * (3e8 * 1.3713e-23) 

Wait

---------------

, the previous calculation with c gave 3e8 * 1.37e-23 ≈4.11e-15. 



---------------

Multiplying by 0.98875: 4.11e-15 * 0.98875 ≈4.065

---------------

e-15 m. 

Ah! So that gives exactly option B (4.0655e-15). 

Ah, I see! I think

---------------

 my mistake was assuming that the velocity is exactly c, but in reality, even though it's close, the exact calculation requires

---------------

 using v = pc / E, which is less than c, so the velocity is slightly less. Therefore, the correct distance is 

---------------

0.98875 times the previous value, which brings it down to ~4.065e-15 m, which matches option B. 

So that

---------------

's why my first approach was missing this factor. Therefore, the correct answer should be B.

Let me verify this step-by-step again:



---------------

1. Calculate Γ in eV: 320 MeV = 3.2e8 eV.

2. τ = ħ/(Γ) = (6.58228e-16 eV·s)/(3.2e8 eV) = 2.05696e-24 s.

3. Calculate

---------------

 gamma = E/(m c²) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666666...

4. τ_lab = gamma * tau = 6.666666... * 2.05696e-24 = ~1.3713e-23 s.

5. Calculate the momentum p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2)/c.

---------------

 

E is 8 GeV, m c² is 1.2 GeV, so:

p = sqrt(8² - 1.2²) GeV/c = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV/c.

6. Velocity v = (p c)/E = (7.91 GeV/c * c)/8 GeV = 7.91/8 ≈ 0.98875 c.

7. The

---------------

 decay distance d = v * τ_lab = (0.98875 * 3e8 m/s) * 1.3713e-23 s.

Calcul

---------------

ating the numerical part:

0.98875 * 3 = 2.96625.



---------------

2.96625e8 m/s * 1.3713e-23 s = 2.96625 * 1.3713 * 1e-15 m.

Calcul

---------------

ating 2.96625 * 1.3713:

First 2 * 1.3713 = 2.7426,

0.96625 * 1.3713 ≈ 

---------------

1.325 (approximate?)

Wait let's compute it precisely:

1.3713 * 2.96625:

Multiply

---------------

 1.3713 * 2 = 2.7426

1.3713 * 0.96625 = ?

Let

---------------

 me compute 1.3713 * 0.96625:

First, 1.3713 * 0.9 = 1.23417

1.3713 * 0.06625 = approx

---------------

 1.3713 * 0.06 = 0.082278 and 1.3713 *0.00625=0.0085706. Total 

---------------

0.082278 +0.0085706≈0.09085.

Total for

---------------

 0.96625 is 1.23417 +0.09085 ≈ 1.32502.

Adding to the previous 2.7426 +1.32502 ≈4.0676.

So total is approximately

---------------

 4.0676e-15 m. That's very close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m. The slight difference is probably due to rounding during intermediate steps. So

---------------

 the precise calculation would give exactly option B.

Therefore, the correct answer is B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson X, we start by calculating the proper lifetime using

---------------

 the relation \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \). Converting \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} \) to eV gives \( 3.2 \times 10^8 \, \text{eV} \). Using \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \), we find:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{3.2 \times 10^8} \approx 2.057 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

Next, the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is calculated from the production energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X c^2} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.667.
\]

The lab-frame lifetime is \( \tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau \approx 6.667 \times 2.057 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.371 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \).

To find the velocity \( v \), we use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The momentum \( p \) is:

\[
p = \frac{\sqrt{(E_X)^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{c} = \frac{\sqrt{64 - 1.44}}{c} \approx \frac{7.91 \, \text{GeV}/c}{c}.
\]

The velocity \( v \) is then:

\[
v = \frac{pc}{E_X} = \frac{7.91}{8}c \approx 0.98875c.
\]

Finally, the mean decay distance \( d \) is:

\[
d = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}} \approx (0.98875 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}) \cdot 1.371 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \approx 4.065 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

This matches option B.

Answer: B<|im_end|>
