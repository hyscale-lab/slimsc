Okay, so I have this question about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Let me try to think

---------------

 through this step by step. 

First, the question mentions a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, and it specifies that m (the orbital magnetic quantum number) is small. The magnetic field is 1 Tesla. They want to compare the param

---------------

agnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE, which has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. The options are about whether ⟨H⟩ is much less than, much

---------------

 greater than, equal to, or just greater than ΔE.

Hmm, paramagnetic coupling term... I remember that in the context of the hydrogen atom, the paramagnetic effect comes from the interaction between the electron's orbital motion and the magnetic field. The Hamilton

---------------

ian term for that would be something like the Zeeman effect. Wait, the Zeeman effect is the splitting of spectral lines in a magnetic field. But

---------------

 the paramagnetic term might be part of that splitting. 

The Zeeman effect has two parts: the normal (or linear) Zeeman effect,

---------------

 which is due to the orbital angular momentum interacting with the magnetic field, and the anomalous Zeeman effect, which involves spin as

---------------

 well. Since the question specifies m (the orbital magnetic quantum number), maybe they are referring to the orbital part here, so the normal Zeeman effect?

The paramagnetic coupling term's

---------------

 expectation value ⟨H⟩ would then be the energy shift due to the magnetic field. The formula for the Zeeman effect's

---------------

 orbital contribution is H = μ_B * B * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. So the energy shift is

---------------

 proportional to m times B. 

Now, the transition energy ΔE given here is for a wavelength of 0.4861 μm. Let me calculate

---------------

 the energy of that transition first. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. Let me plug in the numbers. 

First

---------------

, the wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 0.4861e-6 meters. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. 

Calculating E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.4861e-6). Let me compute that:



---------------

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25.

---------------

 Divided by 0.4861e-6 gives roughly 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 ≈ 4.09e-19 J. To

---------------

 convert that to electron volts, since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 4.09e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV. 



---------------

Wait, but hydrogen transitions are usually in the order of electron volts. The given wavelength is 0.4861 microns?

---------------

 Wait, 0.4861 microns is 486.1 nanometers, which is in the visible range. The

---------------

 Balmer series has transitions ending at n=2. For example, the Balmer-alpha line is 656 nm (red), Balmer-beta is 486 nm (blue), which matches the given wavelength. So that's

---------------

 the H-beta line, which corresponds to a transition from n=4 to n=2? Wait, let me confirm the

---------------

 exact transitions. 

The Balmer series is transitions to n=2. The wavelengths are calculated by 1/λ = R(1/2² - 1/n²), where R is the Rydberg constant (≈1.097e7 m⁻¹). Let's check for λ

---------------

=486.1 nm (which is 486.1e-9 m):

1/λ = 1/(486.1e-9) ≈ 2.057e6 m⁻¹. 



---------------

R*(1/4 -1/n²) = R*(1/4 - 1/n²) = 1.097e7*(0

---------------

.25 - 1/n²) = 2.057e6? 

Let's solve for n. Let's rearrange:

0.25 - 1/n² = (2.057e6)/(1.097e7) ≈ 0.1874.

Thus, 1/n² = 0.25 - 0.1874 = 0.0626, so n² ≈ 1/0.0626 ≈ 16, so n=4. So

---------------

 the transition is from n=4 to n=2. 

The energy difference ΔE between n=4 and n=2 in

---------------

 hydrogen can also be calculated via the Rydberg formula. The energy levels of hydrogen are E_n = -13.6 eV / n². 

So ΔE between n=4 and n=2 would be E_2 - E_4 = (-13.6/4) - (-13.6/16) = (-3.4) - (-0.85) = -2.55 eV. The absolute value is 2.55 eV, which matches the earlier calculation from

---------------

 the wavelength. 

Now, the paramagnetic term ⟨H⟩ is the Zeeman splitting, which for the orbital part is μ_B * B * m. The

---------------

 Bohr magneton μ_B is approximately 9.27e-24 J/T. 

Let's compute the energy shift for

---------------

 a given m. Since B is 1 T, then H = μ_B * B * m. So H = 9.27e-24 J/T * 1 T * m = 9.27e-24 * m J. 

But

---------------

 the transition energy ΔE is about 2.55 eV. Let's convert that to Joules to compare. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 2.55 eV is 2.55 * 1.602e-19 ≈ 4.08e-19 J. 

So the param

---------------

agnetic term H is 9.27e-24 * m J. The question states that m is small. Since

---------------

 m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, its maximum value is l, which is n-1. For the transition from n=4 to n=2, the initial and final states have different l values, but m

---------------

 can range from -l to +l. However, the problem says "for small m". Let's assume m is on

---------------

 the order of 1 or so. 

Suppose m is 1, then H would be ~9.27e-24 J. Compar

---------------

ing that to ΔE of ~4e-19 J. 

The ratio of H/ΔE is (9.27e-24)/(4e-19) ≈ 2.3e-5. So H is about 2.3e-5 times ΔE. Since

---------------

 that's much less than 1, then H is much smaller than ΔE. 

Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy. So the correct answer would be option C.

---------------

 

Wait, but let me check if I made any miscalculations here. Let me recalculate the numbers again.

---------------

 

The Bohr magneton μ_B is approximately 9.27 × 10^-24 J/T. 



---------------

For B = 1 T, the energy term H = μ_B * B * m. 

If m=1, H = 9.27e-24 J. 

The transition energy ΔE is 2.55 eV,

---------------

 which is 4.08e-19 J. 

So H is 9.27e-24 J

---------------

 vs ΔE is 4.08e-19 J. 

The ratio H/ΔE = 9.27e-24 / 4.08e-19 ≈ (9.27/4.08)*1e-5 ≈ ~2.27 * 1e-5 �

---------------

� 2.27e-5. So yes, H is about 2e-5 times ΔE. 



---------------

Therefore, H is much smaller than ΔE, so the answer should be C. 

Another point to consider: the question says "for

---------------

 small m". Even if m were up to say 3 (since for n=4, l can be up to 3, so m could

---------------

 be up to 3), then H would be 3*9.27e-24 ~2.8e-23 J, which divided by 4e-19 is ~7e-5, still way smaller than 1. 

Therefore

---------------

, even with m=3, it's still much smaller. 

Thus, the correct option is C.


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of a hydrogen atom, we start by calculating ΔE using the given wavelength λ = 0.4861 µm (486.1 nm). The energy of the photon is calculated

---------------

 as:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s})(3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s})}{0.4861 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}} \approx 4.08 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \, \text{or} \, 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
\]

The paramagnetic coupling term due

---------------

 to the orbital Zeeman effect is given by:

\[
\langle H \rangle = \mu_B B m,
\]

where μ_B is the Bohr magneton (\(9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T}\)), B = 1 T, and m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. For small m (e.g., m = 1 or

---------------

 2), the energy shift is:

\[
\langle H \rangle \approx (9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T})(1 \, \text{T})(m) \approx 9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J} \, \text{(for m = 1)}.
\]

Comparing the magnitudes:

\[
\frac{\langle H \rangle}{\Delta E} \approx \frac{9.27 \times 10^{-24}}{4.08 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.27 \times 10^{-5} \ll 1.
\]

Even for the maximum plausible

---------------

 m (e.g., m = 3), the ratio remains negligible. Thus, the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy.
