Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the question is about a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. They want to know the momentum of a photon needed for the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state when in its fundamental state. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I need to recall what the fundamental state means here. The fundamental state is

---------------

 the lowest energy state, which for a quantum system would be the ground state. But when they mention switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy, I think this is

---------------

 about a transition between energy levels. Since it's a rotation-vibration model, the molecule has both rotational and vibrational energy levels. The

---------------

 question is probably asking about a transition that involves the lowest possible energy change. 

Hmm, the problem states the molecule is in the fundamental state. The

---------------

 fundamental state for a quantum harmonic oscillator (vibrational) is the n=0 state. But for rotation, the ground

---------------

 state is also the lowest rotational level, which is l=0 (since rotational quantum number l starts at 0). So

---------------

 the fundamental state here is likely the lowest vibrational and rotational state, so n=0 and l=0?

Wait, but the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy". So when

---------------

 the photon is absorbed, the molecule goes to the next state with the least energy. So maybe the transition is the lowest possible energy transition from

---------------

 the fundamental state. 

But which transition would that be? Since both vibrational and rotational transitions are possible. The question might

---------------

 be referring to a rotational transition because the problem mentions the rotation-vibration model, but sometimes in these models, the vibrational transitions are usually

---------------

 much higher in energy than rotational transitions. But I need to check.

Alternatively, maybe they are considering the vibrational state first

---------------

. The fundamental state (ground state) is n=0. To go to the next state (n=1), that would be a vibrational transition. The energy difference for

---------------

 vibrational states is ΔE_vib = ħω (since for harmonic oscillator, ΔE between n and n+1 is ħω). But

---------------

 if the question is about rotational transitions, then the energy levels for rotation are (l(l+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. So the

---------------

 lowest transition would be from l=0 to l=1, since that's the first allowed rotational transition (since Δl must

---------------

 be ±1? Wait, rotational transitions usually have Δl = ±1, so the lowest possible rotational transition from l=0 would be to l=1. 



---------------

But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So between a vibrational transition and a rotational transition, which has lower energy? Vibr

---------------

ational frequencies are typically higher (like in the IR region) whereas rotational transitions are in the microwave region, so the energy is

---------------

 lower for rotational. So maybe the photon's energy corresponds to a rotational transition from l=0 to l=1? But

---------------

 the problem mentions "the next state with the lowest possible energy", so the transition to the next possible state which has the least

---------------

 energy. So if the fundamental state is the lowest energy (n=0, l=0), then the next possible state with

---------------

 the least energy would be the first excited state. Since rotational transitions require less energy than vibrational, the transition would be rotational. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the rotation-vibration coupling, but in the rigid rotor approximation, the vibrational and rotational energies

---------------

 are separate. Wait, the problem says "quantum rotation-vibration model (or non-rigid rotor model)". Hmm, the

---------------

 non-rigid rotor model accounts for the vibrational motion, so the moment of inertia might vary with vibrational state? But I

---------------

'm not sure if that affects the calculation here. 

Wait, the problem says "the next state with the lowest possible energy". The fundamental

---------------

 state is the lowest energy. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the first excited state, which would be the lowest

---------------

 energy excited state. So if the ground state is n=0 (vibrational) and l=0 (rotational), then the first excited state could be either n=1 (vibrational) or l=1 (rotational). Since

---------------

 rotational transitions have lower energy, the transition to l=1 would be the lower energy one. Therefore, the photon's energy would

---------------

 correspond to the rotational energy difference between l=0 and l=1. 

Wait, but I should check the problem again. The question says

---------------

 "the next state with the lowest possible energy". So the next state must be the immediate next one. Wait, maybe the

---------------

 question is phrased such that the "next state with the lowest possible energy" is the first excited state. So that

---------------

 would be the lowest energy transition. 

Therefore, if that's a rotational transition, then the energy difference is ΔE_rot = E_rot(1) - E_rot(0). The

---------------

 rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) l(l+1). So the difference between l=1 and l=0 is (ħ²/(2I))(

---------------

1(2) - 0) = (ħ²/(2I))(2) = ħ²/I. 

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 I need to consider that when you go from l=0 to l=1, the energy difference is E_rot(1) - E_rot(0) = (ħ²/(2I))(1*(

---------------

1+1) - 0) = (ħ²/(2I))*(2) = ħ²/I. 

So

---------------

 the energy of the photon must equal that. Since the photon's energy is E_photon = pc, where p is momentum.

---------------

 Wait, but photon energy is usually E = hf = hc/λ, but also E = pc because photons have no rest mass, so their energy is all

---------------

 kinetic. Since E = pc, then p = E/c. 

Wait, but let me make sure. The energy of a photon is E = h

---------------

ν, and since for photons, E = pc, then p = hν / c. Alternatively, since c = λν, so E

---------------

 = hc/λ = pc, so yes, p = E/c. Therefore, if we can find the energy difference Δ

---------------

E_rot, then the momentum p is (ΔE_rot)/c. 

So first, calculate the rotational energy difference between l=1 and l=0. 

To

---------------

 do that, we need the moment of inertia I. The moment of inertia for a diatomic molecule is I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass, and R is the bond length. 

The reduced mass μ is given by (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). The

---------------

 masses are given as 20 amu and 2 amu. 

So μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. 

But we need to convert amu to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. 

So μ = (20/11) * 1.6605e-27 kg. Let me compute that. 

20 divided by 11 is approximately 1.818. 



---------------

1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ let's see, 1.8 *1.66 = ~

---------------

2.988, so around 2.988e-27 kg. 

Wait, let me compute it

---------------

 more accurately. 

1.818 * 1.6605 = 

1.8 *1.6605 = 2.9889



---------------

0.018 * 1.6605 = 0.029889

Total is approx 2.9889 + 0.029889 ≈ 3.0188e-27 kg. 

Hmm, okay

---------------

. 

The bond length R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 m, so R = 2e-10 m. 

So the moment of inertia I = μ R² = (3.0188e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 

Calcul

---------------

ating R squared: (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m². 

Multiply that by μ:

3.0188e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 12.075e-47 kg·m² �

---------------

� 1.2075e-46 kg·m². 

Now, the energy difference ΔE_rot = ħ² / I. 

ħ

---------------

 is the reduced Planck's constant, which is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. 

So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ (1.05457)^2 *

---------------

 1e-68 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s²? Wait, no, actually

---------------

, the units of ħ²/(I) would be (J·s)^2/(kg·m²). Wait, let

---------------

 me think again. 

Wait, the energy E_rot is (ħ^2/(2I)) l(l+1). So the difference between l=1 and l=0 is (ħ²/(2I))(2) = ħ²/(I). 

Wait, yes

---------------

, so ΔE_rot is ħ² divided by I. 

Wait, let me confirm the formula again. The rotational energy levels are (ħ²/(2I)) l(l+1). 

So when

---------------

 l=0, energy is 0. 

When l=1, energy is (ħ²/(2I))*(1*2) = (ħ²/(2I))*2 = ħ²/I. 

Therefore

---------------

, the energy difference between l=1 and l=0 is indeed ħ²/I. 

So ΔE_rot = ħ² / I. 

Pl

---------------

ugging in the numbers:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s



---------------

So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ (1.0545718)^2 * 1e-68 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J²·s²).

---------------

 Wait, but when divided by I (kg·m²), the units would be (J²·s²)/(kg·m²). Wait, this

---------------

 seems off. Maybe I made a mistake here. 

Wait, let's think in terms of units. ħ has units of J·s. So

---------------

 ħ squared is (J·s)^2. Divided by I (kg·m²). 

But energy has

---------------

 units of J. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck. 

Wait, the

---------------

 energy difference is (ħ²/(2I)) * [l(l+1) - l'(l'+1)]. Here

---------------

, l=1, l'=0, so 2 - 0 = 2. So the difference is (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/I. 



---------------

Yes, so the energy is indeed ħ² divided by I. 

But let me compute the numerical value. 

ħ

---------------

 squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approximately (1.05457e-34)^2. Let me compute that:



---------------

1.05457e-34 squared:

First, 1.05457^2 ≈ 1.112 (

---------------

since 1.05^2 is 1.1025, and 0.00457 more

---------------

). 

So 1.112 * 1e-68 (since (1e-34)^2 is 1e-68). So �

---------------

�² ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s²? Wait, but actually, the

---------------

 units for ħ²/I would be (J·s)^2 / (kg·m²). Hmm, maybe I should just

---------------

 proceed with the numbers and see. 

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me recast the energy difference.

---------------

 

Wait, the rotational energy levels are E_l = (l(l+1) h²)/(8π²I). Because

---------------

 sometimes it's written in terms of h instead of ħ. Let me check that formula. 

Hmm, different sources might use

---------------

 different expressions. Let me think again. 

The angular momentum is L = ħ sqrt(l(l+1)), so the energy is (L²)/(2I) = (ħ² l(l+1))/(2I). 



---------------

Yes, that's correct. So the energy levels are E_l = (ħ²/(2I)) l(l+1). 

Therefore, the difference between l=1 and l=0 is (

---------------

ħ²/(2I))*(1*2 - 0) = (ħ²/(2I))*2 = ħ²/I. 

So the energy difference is indeed ħ² / I. 

So

---------------

 let's compute this. 

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s



---------------

ħ squared = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx

---------------

 1.112e-68 (J²·s²). 

Then I is 1.2075e-46 kg·m². 

So ΔE_rot = (1.112e-68 J²·s²) / (1.2075e-46 kg·m²). 

Wait, units

---------------

 here: J is kg·m²/s². So J²·s² divided by kg·m² would be ( (kg²·m^4/s^4) * s² ) / (kg·m²) ) = kg·m²/s², which is J. So units are correct. 

Calcul

---------------

ating the numerical value: 

1.112e-68 / 1.2075e-46 ≈ (1.112 / 1.2075) * 1e-22 ≈ approx

---------------

 0.92 * 1e-22 ≈ 9.2e-23 J. 

Wait, let

---------------

 me compute that division more precisely: 

1.112 divided by 1.2075. Let me see:

---------------

 1.2075 * 0.92 = 1.2075*0.9 =1.08675 and

---------------

 1.2075*0.02=0.02415 → total 1.1109. Oh

---------------

, so 1.112 /1.2075 ≈ 0.92. 

So Δ

---------------

E_rot ≈ 0.92 * 1e-22 J = 9.2e-23 J. 

Hmm

---------------

, okay. 

Now, the photon's energy must equal this. Since E_photon = pc (since for photons, E = pc).

---------------

 Therefore, p = E/(c). 

The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s. 

So p = 9.2e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) 

Wait

---------------

, J is kg·m²/s², so dividing by m/s gives (kg·m²/s²) / (m/s) = kg·m/s. Which is correct

---------------

 for momentum. 

Calculating: 

9.2e-23 / 3e8 = (9.2/3) * 1e-31 ≈ 3.066...e-31? Wait, 9.2 divided by 3 is about

---------------

 3.066, so 3.066e-31? Wait, no, 1e-23 divided by 1e8 is 1e-31, so yes. 

Wait, let

---------------

 me recalculate:

9.2e-23 divided by 3e8 = (9.2/3) * (1e-23 / 1e8) = 3.066666... * 1e-31 = 3.06666e-31 kg·m/s. 

Wait

---------------

, but the options are given in N·s. Since 1 N·s = 1 kg·m/s, so the

---------------

 units are the same. 

Looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28 N·s

B) 2.3e-27

C) 1.1e-27

D) 1.4e-28

Hmm, my calculation gave 

---------------

3.07e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3.07e-31 N·s. That's way smaller than any of the options. Wait

---------------

, that can't be right. I must have messed up a calculation step. 

Wait, this discrepancy is huge. Let me check where

---------------

 I went wrong. 

Let me retrace the steps. 

First, the reduced mass μ:

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. 

1

---------------

 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg. 

So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg

---------------

. Let me compute that again:

1.818 * 1.6605. 

1.8 *1.6605 = 2.9889



---------------

0.018 *1.6605 = 0.029889 

Total is 2.9889 + 0.029889 ≈ 3.0188e-27 kg. 



---------------

Wait, that's correct. 

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m. 

So I = μ * R² = 3.0188e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2. 

(

---------------

2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m². 

So I = 3.0188e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2075e-46 kg·m². Correct. 

Then ΔE_rot = ħ² / I. 

ħ

---------------

 is 1.05457e-34 J·s. 

So ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx

---------------

 (1.05457)^2 * 1e-68. Let me compute that more accurately. 

1.05457 squared is:

---------------

 

1.05^2 = 1.1025 

0.00457^2 = ~0.0000209 

Cross terms: 2 *1.05 *0.00457 ≈ 0.009597 

Total: 1.1025 + 0.009597 + 0.0000209 ≈ ~1.1121. 

So (

---------------

1.05457)^2 ≈1.112. 

So ħ squared is 1.112e-68 J²·s². 

Then

---------------

, dividing by I (1.2075e-46 kg·m²):

ΔE_rot = (1.112e-68)/(1.2075e-46) 

Let

---------------

 me compute that exponent: 1e-68 divided by 1e-46 is 1e-22. 

So

---------------

 1.112 / 1.2075 ≈0.92, so 0.92e-22 J?

---------------

 Wait no, 1.112e-68 divided by 1.2075e-46 = (1.112/1.2075) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.92 * 1e-22 = 9.2e-23 J. 

Wait

---------------

, so that's correct. 

Then E_photon = 9.2e-23 J, and p = E/c = 9.2e-23 / (3e8) 

Wait

---------------

, 9.2e-23 divided by 3e8 is (9.2/3) * 1e-31 �

---------------

� 3.066e-31 kg·m/s. 

But the options are like 1e-27 or

---------------

 1e-28. So this is way off. 

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake. Let

---------------

 me think again. 

Wait, maybe I used the wrong energy difference. Perhaps it's a vibrational transition instead of rotational? 

Let

---------------

 me check that possibility. 

If the transition is vibrational, the energy difference between n=0 and n=1 would be ħω. 

The

---------------

 given angular frequency is ω = 4e14 rad/s. 

So ΔE_vib = ħω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = approx

---------------

 4.218e-20 J. 

Then p = E/c = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 = approx

---------------

 1.4e-28 N·s. 

Looking at the options, that's option D. 

Hmm, but why

---------------

 would the question mention the rotation-vibration model if it's just a vibrational transition? Wait, the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy". The

---------------

 vibrational transition would have a much higher energy than rotational. So the lowest energy transition would be rotational. But according to my calculation

---------------

, the rotational momentum is way too small (3e-31) which isn't among the options. 

Hmm, so

---------------

 there must be an error in my calculation. Let me check the formula again. 

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula for rotational energy difference. Let me see

---------------

. 

The rotational energy levels are E_l = (ħ²/(2I)) l(l+1). 

The energy difference between l=1 and l=0 is E_1 - E_0 = (ħ²/(2I))(1*2 - 0) = (ħ²/(2I))

---------------

 * 2 = ħ² / I. That's correct. 

Hmm, so maybe the problem is in the calculation

---------------

 of the moment of inertia. 

Wait, the bond length is given as R = 2 angstroms. But in

---------------

 the moment of inertia formula, R is the bond length, which is the distance between the atoms. So the reduced mass is

---------------

 correct. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in calculating the reduced mass. Let me recalculate μ again. 

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. 

μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈1.818 amu. 

Yes, that's correct. 

Hmm

---------------

, let me check the value of ħ. Maybe I used ħ instead of h somewhere? 

Wait, the energy

---------------

 is (ħ²/(2I)) l(l+1). So if I had used h instead of ħ, then

---------------

 the energy would be (h²/(8π² I)) l(l+1). Let me see. 

Wait, another

---------------

 formula for rotational energy is E = (h²/(8π² I)) l(l+1). Let me confirm.

---------------

 

Yes, sometimes rotational energy is expressed with h instead of ħ. Let me check that. 

Since ħ = h/(2π), so substituting into

---------------

 the previous formula: 

E = ( (h/(2π))² )/(2I) ) * l(l+1) 

= ( h²/(4π²) ) / (2I) * l(l+1) 

= h²/(8π² I) * l(l+1). 

Ah, so that

---------------

's another way to write it. 

So depending on which formula you use, you need to be careful. 

So if

---------------

 I use E = (h²/(8π² I)) l(l+1), then the energy difference between l=1 and l=0 would be:



---------------

ΔE_rot = (h²/(8π² I))*(2 -0) = (h²/(8π² I)) *2 

= h²/(4π² I). 

Hmm

---------------

, that's different from the previous result. 

So now, let's recalculate using this formula. 

First, h

---------------

 is Planck's constant: 6.62607015e-34 J·s. 

So h squared is (6.626e-34)^2. 

Then

---------------

, ΔE_rot = ( (6.626e-34)^2 )/(4 * π² * I)

---------------

 

Let me compute that. 

First compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 43.9e-68 (since 6.6^2 is

---------------

 ~43.56). 

Denominator: 4 * π² * I. 

π² is approx 9.8696. 

So denominator: 4 *9.8696 * 1.2075e-46 

First

---------------

 compute 4 *9.8696 ≈ 39.4784 

Multiply by 1.2075e-46: 39.4784 *1.2075 ≈ let

---------------

's see, 39 *1.2 is 46.8, plus 0.4784*1.20

---------------

75 ≈ ~0.578, so total ≈47.378e-46?

---------------

 Wait, no, wait:

Wait, 39.4784 *1.2075 = ?



---------------

Let me compute 39.4784 *1 = 39.4784 

39.4784 *0.2 = 7.89568 

39.4784 *0.0075 = ~0.296 

Adding up

---------------

: 39.4784 +7.89568 =47.37408 +0.296 ≈47.670

---------------

 

So denominator is approx 47.670e-46 (since 1.2075e-46 *39.4784 is

---------------

 47.67e-46). 

So denominator is 47.67e-46 kg·m². 

So

---------------

 ΔE_rot = (43.9e-68 J²·s²) / (47.67e-46 kg·m²). 

Wait, units

---------------

 again: J is kg·m²/s². So J²·s² divided by kg·m²:

(

---------------

 (kg²·m^4/s^4)*s² ) / (kg·m²) ) = kg·m²/s² = J. So units are okay. 

Calcul

---------------

ating the numbers: 

43.9 /47.67 ≈0.921 

So 0.921 * 1e-22 (since 1e-68 /1e-46 is 1e-22). 

So

---------------

 ΔE_rot ≈0.921e-22 J ≈9.21e-23 J. 

Wait, that's the same as before! Because

---------------

 when I used ħ² / I, I got the same result as when I use h²/(4π² I). 



---------------

Wait, let me see:

Because ħ = h/(2π), so ħ² = h²/(4π²). 

So substituting back into the first formula:



---------------

ΔE_rot (from first approach) is ħ² / I = (h²/(4π²))/I 

Which is exactly the same as the second approach's Δ

---------------

E_rot = h²/(4π² I). 

So both methods give the same result. So that's correct. 

Hmm, so the

---------------

 calculation is correct, but the resulting momentum is 3e-31, which is not in the options. 

Hmm

---------------

. That suggests that perhaps the question is actually referring to a vibrational transition, even though the energy is higher. 

Wait

---------------

, the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy". The ground state is the lowest energy. The next possible state would

---------------

 be the first excited state. Which has the lowest energy possible. So between vibrational and rotational, which has lower energy? 

The

---------------

 vibrational frequency is given as ω =4e14 rad/s. The rotational energy transition is what I calculated (

---------------

9.2e-23 J). 

The vibrational energy difference is ΔE_vib = ħω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 ≈4.218e-20 J. 

So

---------------

 that's much larger than the rotational energy difference. 

So the rotational transition is the lower energy one, so the photon needed

---------------

 for that is p = ΔE_rot /c = 9.2e-23 /3e8 ≈ 3.06e-31 N·s, which is way smaller than the options given. 

Hmm, so

---------------

 that can't be. So where is the mistake here?

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the bond length? The problem says R is 2 angstroms. 

---------------

1 angstrom is 1e-10 m, so that's correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking

---------------

 for the momentum in the vibrational transition, even though that's a higher energy, but perhaps I misunderstood the question. Let me re-read it. 

Question: "what momentum should an absorbed photon have, in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy?" 

Ah

---------------

! The "next state with the lowest possible energy" — perhaps "next" here is the next possible state, but the

---------------

 "lowest possible energy" refers to the energy of the photon? Wait, no. The wording is a bit confusing. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking

---------------

 for the transition to the next state (i.e., the first excited state), which has the lowest possible energy. Since rotational

---------------

 transitions have lower energy, then the answer should be based on that. But then the calculation gives a momentum not in the options. 

Hmm. Let

---------------

 me check the options again. 

Options:

A) 1.9e-28 

B) 2.3e-27 

C) 1.1e-27 

D) 1.4e-28 

Wait

---------------

, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass? Let me check the masses again. 

The problem states M

---------------

x = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. 

So μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈1.818 amu. 

Yes

---------------

, that's correct. 

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the vibrational transition, but they used the

---------------

 angular frequency given (4e14 rad/s). Let me see what the momentum would be in that case. 

Δ

---------------

E_vib = ħω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = approx

---------------

 4.218e-20 J. 

Then p = E/c = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 ≈1.406e-28 N·s. That's option D. 

Hmm

---------------

, so that's exactly option D. 

But why would the question mention the rotation-vibration model if it's just a vibrational transition? The

---------------

 question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy". The lowest possible energy transition is rotational, but the problem gives the

---------------

 vibrational frequency. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick, where when they say "the next state with the lowest possible energy", they

---------------

 mean the next vibrational state, but the lowest possible energy for the photon? Wait, but vibrational transitions have higher energy. 

Alternatively, maybe the

---------------

 question is asking for the transition to the next rotational state but the given parameters include vibrational frequency which is not needed? 

Alternatively, maybe I made

---------------

 an error in calculating the rotational energy. Let me try another approach. 

Wait, perhaps the question is expecting me to consider the vibr

---------------

ational transition because the problem mentions "fundamental state", which in some contexts refers to the vibrational ground state. So perhaps

---------------

 the question is about a vibrational transition from n=0 to n=1. 

If that's the case, then the energy difference

---------------

 is indeed ΔE_vib = ħω. Then the momentum would be p = ΔE_vib / c = (ħ ω)/c. 

Pl

---------------

ugging in numbers: 

ħ = 1.05457e-34 J·s 

ω =4e14 rad/s 

c =3e8 m/s 

So p = (1.05457e-34 *4e14) /3e8 

=

---------------

 (4.218e-20) /3e8 

=1.406e-28 N·s 



---------------

Which is option D. 

Given that this matches option D and the options include that, perhaps the question is referring to a vibrational transition.

---------------

 Maybe the rotation part is a red herring, or perhaps the question is in the context where only vibrational transitions are considered for

---------------

 the fundamental state. 

Alternatively, maybe the term "fundamental state" refers to the vibrational ground state, and the question wants the transition to the first excited vibrational state, ignoring

---------------

 rotation. 

The problem statement mentions the rotation-vibration model, but perhaps the question is about the vibrational part. Since

---------------

 the angular frequency of vibration is given, which is needed for the vibrational transition. The rotational parameters (masses and bond length) are

---------------

 given, but if the question is about the vibrational transition, they might not be needed. 

Alternatively, maybe I made

---------------

 a mistake in the rotational calculation. Let me see. 

Wait, the rotational energy difference was 9.2e-23 J, which

---------------

 gives p ~3e-31 N·s, which is not an option. The vibrational gives ~1.4e-28, which is option D. Since the given

---------------

 angular frequency is for vibration, and the problem mentions "fundamental state", which is vibrational ground state, maybe the intended

---------------

 answer is D. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the reduced mass calculation. Wait, let me check that again. 

Wait

---------------

, the question says "diatomic molecule, with elements X and Y". The reduced mass is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). 



---------------

Wait, but sometimes, the formula is written as μ = (M1*M2)/(M1 + M2). So

---------------

 that's correct. 

So μ = (20 *2)/(22) =40/22 ≈1.818 amu. 

Con

---------------

verting to kg: 1.818 *1.66e-27 kg/amu. 

Wait

---------------

, perhaps I used the wrong value for amu? Let me confirm the exact value of 1 amu. 

1 atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. 

So 

---------------

1.818 *1.6605e-27 = let me compute more precisely. 

1.818 *1.6605 =

---------------

 

Let me compute 1.8 *1.6605 = 2.9889 

0.018 *1.6605 = 0.029889 

Total: 2.9889 +0.029889 = 3.0188 

So μ =3.0188e-27 kg. 

Yes

---------------

, that's correct. 

Hmm. Maybe the question is expecting the rotational transition but there was a mistake in the problem's given

---------------

 values? For example, if the bond length was 2 angstroms, but perhaps in the calculation I need to use a

---------------

 different unit? Wait, no. 

Alternatively, perhaps I confused the formula for momentum. Wait, photon momentum is p = h / λ. 



---------------

Alternatively, energy is E = hc/λ, so p = E/c = (hc/λ)/c = h/λ. 

Alternatively, using

---------------

 p = h / λ. 

But the energy of the photon is E = h f = hc/λ. 

Alternatively

---------------

, if we have the energy difference ΔE, then p = ΔE /c. 

Yes, that's correct. 

Hmm. Given

---------------

 that the vibrational calculation gives an option D which is present, and the rotational gives an answer not in the options, I

---------------

 think the intended answer is D. 

Perhaps the question is referring to the vibrational transition. Maybe the mention of the rotation-vibration model is just part

---------------

 of the setup, but the question is about the vibrational transition. 

Alternatively, maybe the "next state with the lowest possible energy" is

---------------

 the first excited rotational state when in the vibrational ground state. But even then, the calculation gives too low a momentum. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made

---------------

 a mistake in the formula for rotational energy difference. Let me think again. 

Wait, another way to write the rotational energy is E_l = B l(l+1), where B is the rotational constant. 

B = ħ²/(2I). 

So

---------------

 the energy difference between l=1 and l=0 is B*(2 -0) = 2B. 

Wait, no

---------------

. Wait, E_1 = B*(1)(2) = 2B, and E_0 is 0. So the difference is 2B. 

So

---------------

 B = ħ²/(2I), so 2B = ħ²/I. Which matches the earlier calculation. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is

---------------

 referring to the transition between vibrational states with simultaneous change in rotational states? But that complicates things. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is

---------------

 not considering rotational transitions and just wants the vibrational, since the parameters for rotation might not be necessary. 

The problem gives the

---------------

 angular frequency of vibration (w =4e14 rad/s), which is needed for the vibrational transition. The other

---------------

 parameters (masses and bond length) are perhaps for a different question, but in this case, since the answer comes out correctly

---------------

 with the vibrational transition, maybe that's the intended path. 

Given that, the momentum would be 1.4e-28, which is option D. 

Alternatively

---------------

, maybe I messed up the calculation steps. Let me recheck the vibrational calculation. 

ΔE_vib = ħω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 

Let me compute 1.05457e-34 *4e14 =

---------------

 4.21828e-20 J. 

Divided by c (3e8 m/s): 

4.21828e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg·m/s.

---------------

 

Yes, exactly. 

So that's option D. 

Perhaps the mention of rotation is a distractor. The question says

---------------

 "the next state with the lowest possible energy". The fundamental state (n=0) can transition to n=1,

---------------

 which is the first excited state. Since rotational transitions are lower energy, but the problem gives the vibrational frequency, and the masses

---------------

 and bond length are perhaps for another part. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is in error, but since the given options include D which matches the vibrational calculation

---------------

, I think that's the intended answer. 

Therefore, the answer is D.


To determine the momentum of a photon required for the diatomic molecule to transition from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state, we consider the vibr

---------------

ational transition since the problem provides the vibrational angular frequency (ω) and the answer options align with the vibrational energy calculation. 

The fundamental state corresponds

---------------

 to the ground vibrational state (n=0). The next lowest energy state is the first excited vibrational state (n=1). The energy difference for this transition is given by ΔE_vib = ħω. 

Given

---------------

:
- Planck's constant ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s
- Angular frequency ω = 4×10¹⁴ rad/s

The energy difference is:
ΔE_vib = (1.0545718e-34 J·s)(4×10¹⁴ rad/s) ≈ 4.218×10⁻²⁰ J

The photon's momentum (p) is related to its energy (E) by E

---------------

 = pc, where c is the speed of light (3×10⁸ m/s). Solving for p:
p = ΔE_vib / c = (4.218×10⁻²⁰ J) / (3×10⁸ m/s) ≈ 1.4×10⁻²⁸ N·s

This matches option D. The rotational transition was

---------------

 considered but resulted in an answer not listed, suggesting the question focuses on the vibrational transition.
