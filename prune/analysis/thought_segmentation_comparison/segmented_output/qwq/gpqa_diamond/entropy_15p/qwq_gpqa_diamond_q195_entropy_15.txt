Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is about the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, right

---------------

, in classical physics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is straightforward—like sqrt(k/m) times the amplitude, right? But here it's relativistic, so we have to consider special

---------------

 relativity effects. 

The options given are A through D, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think about how to approach this. 

First, in classical

---------------

 mechanics, the maximum speed v_max is indeed sqrt(k/m)*A. But in relativity, the energy considerations change. The total energy would

---------------

 be the sum of kinetic and potential energy, but in relativity, kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², and the potential energy is (1/2)kA².

---------------

 Wait, but maybe the total energy here is the rest mass energy plus the classical energy? Or is there a different way to model it?

Alternatively, maybe the problem

---------------

 is considering the total energy as the relativistic energy, so E = gamma mc², and that equals the total mechanical energy,

---------------

 which in harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA². Wait, no, in the harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy (classical) is (1/2)kA². But in the relativistic case, perhaps

---------------

 the total energy is the relativistic kinetic plus the potential energy? Or maybe the total energy is just the relativistic energy, and

---------------

 the potential energy is part of that?

Hmm, I need to recall how relativistic harmonic oscillators are treated. I remember that in some deriv

---------------

ations, the relativistic energy is considered, so the total energy E is equal to gamma mc² plus the potential energy (1/2)k x². Wait, but that

---------------

 might complicate things because the potential energy would depend on position. Alternatively, maybe in the relativistic case, the equation of motion is modified.

---------------

 

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, but relativistically. So in

---------------

 the classical case, the maximum kinetic energy (1/2 mv_max²) equals the potential energy at maximum displacement, which is (1/2)kA². So

---------------

 v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv²,

---------------

 but instead (gamma - 1)mc². So maybe the total energy at maximum displacement (when velocity is zero) is just

---------------

 the potential energy (1/2 kA²), which equals the total energy E. Then, when the mass is at the equilibrium point (x=0), all that energy is kinetic, so (gamma -1)mc² + 0 = E = (1/2 kA²). Wait, but then

---------------

 gamma would be 1 + (E)/(mc²). 

But wait, the total energy in this case would be E = gamma mc² +

---------------

 (1/2)k x²? No, maybe the total energy is the sum of relativistic kinetic and potential? Hmm

---------------

, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the total energy (

---------------

as in the classical case) is (1/2)kA². But in relativity, the kinetic energy at

---------------

 the equilibrium point (where x=0, so potential energy is zero) must equal that. Wait, but the total energy would be the maximum

---------------

 potential energy plus the rest mass energy? Or maybe not. Maybe the rest mass is considered separate, so the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) is (1/2)kA², same

---------------

 as classical. Then when the mass is at maximum displacement (A), the kinetic energy is zero, so potential energy is (1/2)kA², and that

---------------

's the total mechanical energy. Then, at equilibrium (x=0), all that energy is kinetic. So in relativity, the kinetic energy at

---------------

 that point would be (gamma -1)mc² = (1/2)kA². Then solving for v_max here

---------------

.

So, setting (gamma -1)mc² = (1/2)kA². Then gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²). Then

---------------

 gamma is (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²)). But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So 

---------------

1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²). Then

---------------

 solving for v_max. 

Wait, but that seems possible. Let me write that down:

Let me denote (kA²)/(2mc²) as a small term?

---------------

 Maybe. Let's see.

Let me rearrange the equation:

Let’s denote the term (kA²)/(2mc²) as a

---------------

 variable, say, let’s call it ε for simplicity. So γ = 1 + ε. Then, since γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²), where β = v/c. 

So,

---------------

 1/(sqrt(1 - β²)) = 1 + ε. 

Let me square both sides: 1/(1 - β²) = (1 + ε)^2.

Therefore, 1 - β² = 1/( (1 + ε)^2 )

So

---------------

 β² = 1 - 1/(1 + ε)^2 = [ (1 + ε)^2 -1 ] / (1 + ε)^2 

Expanding numerator: (1 + 2ε + ε²) -1 = 2ε + ε².



---------------

So β² = (2ε + ε²)/(1 + ε)^2 

Thus, β = sqrt( (2ε + ε²) ) / (1 + ε )



---------------

Hmm, but maybe there's a better way to approach this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting an answer where the denominator is

---------------

 (1 - (kA²)/(2mc²)), but let me check the options given.

Looking at the options, option B has (

---------------

1 - kA²/(2mc²))^(-1/2), but let me see:

Wait, let me go

---------------

 back. The equation was:

γ = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²). But γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So,

---------------

 substituting:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²)

Let me denote

---------------

 (kA²)/(2mc²) as ε again. Then:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + ε

Then

---------------

, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + ε)

Squaring both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + ε)^2

Therefore

---------------

,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + ε)^2

= [ (1 + ε)^2 -1 ] / (1 + ε)^2 

Exp

---------------

anding numerator:

(1 + 2ε + ε²) -1 = 2ε + ε²

Thus,

v²/c² = (2ε + ε²)/(1 + ε)^2 

Taking

---------------

 square root:

v/c = sqrt( (2ε + ε²) ) / (1 + ε )

Hmm, but

---------------

 ε is (kA²)/(2mc²). Let me plug that back in.

Wait, but maybe this can be simplified.

---------------

 Let's see:

Let me factor numerator: 2ε + ε² = ε(2 + ε). So,

v/c = sqrt( ε(2 + ε) ) / (1 + ε )

Sub

---------------

stituting ε = (kA²)/(2mc²):

v/c = sqrt( (kA²/(2mc²)) * (2 + kA²/(2mc²)) ) / (1 + kA²/(2mc²) )

Hmm, this

---------------

 seems complicated. Let me see if any of the options match this.

Looking at the options:

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2mc²))

---------------

 )

Wait, let me compute the expression inside the square root for option B. Let me compute 1 + 1/(1 - ε

---------------

'), where ε' is (kA²)/(2mc²). Wait, but the denominator here is (1 - ε

---------------

'), so 1/(1 - ε') plus 1 would be [1 + 1/(1 - ε') ]

---------------

? Wait, no, let me check again.

Option B's expression is sqrt(1 + [1/(1 - (kA²)/(2mc²)) ])

---------------

 ?

Wait, let me parse the option again. The option B says:

v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2mc^2))

---------------

 )

Wait, that's inside the sqrt. Let me compute that term inside the sqrt:

Inside sqrt: 1 + [1/(1 - (kA²)/(2mc²))] 

Hmm

---------------

, that would be [ (1 - (kA²)/(2mc²)) +1 ] / (1 - (kA²)/(2mc²)) ?



---------------

Wait, no, that's not. Let me think again. Let me compute 1 + [1/(1 - x)], where x = (kA²)/(2mc²). That

---------------

 would be ( (1 - x) +1 ) / (1 -x) ) = (2 -x)/(1 -x). So

---------------

 the sqrt term would be sqrt( (2 -x)/(1 -x) )

Hmm, not sure if that's the

---------------

 same as my previous expression. Let me see.

Alternatively, let's see if my derived expression can be manipulated into one of the options.

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think differently.

In the relativistic case, the total energy E

---------------

 is the sum of relativistic kinetic energy and potential energy. At maximum displacement (x=A, v=0), the kinetic energy is zero, so E = (1/2)k A². At the equilibrium point (x=0, v maximum

---------------

), the potential energy is zero, so the total energy is equal to the relativistic kinetic energy: E = (gamma -1) mc². So

---------------

 setting (gamma -1) mc² = (1/2)k A².

Thus, gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²). 



---------------

Now, gamma is also equal to 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Therefore:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²)

Let me denote

---------------

 the term (kA²)/(2 m c²) as ε for simplicity. Then,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + ε

So

---------------

, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + ε)

Squaring both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + ε)^2

Then

---------------

,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + ε)^2 

= [ (1 + ε)^2 -1 ] / (1 + ε)^2 

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2ε + ε²) -1 = 2ε + ε² 

Thus,

v²/c² = (2ε + ε²)/(1 + ε)^2 

Factor

---------------

 numerator as ε(2 + ε):

v²/c² = ε(2 + ε)/(1 + ε)^2 

Taking

---------------

 square roots:

v/c = sqrt( ε(2 + ε) ) / (1 + ε )

Now, substituting back ε = (kA²)/(2 m c²):

Let

---------------

 me write this out:

v/c = sqrt( (kA²/(2 m c²)) * (2 + (kA²)/(2 m c²)) ) / (1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²) )

Hmm, this

---------------

 seems complicated. Let's see if this can be simplified further.

Let me factor the numerator inside the sqrt:

The term inside the sqrt is

---------------

 (kA²/(2mc²))*(2 + (kA²)/(2mc²)) 

Let me write 

---------------

2 as (4mc²)/(2mc²) to have a common denominator? Maybe not. Alternatively, multiply out:

Let

---------------

 me let’s compute the terms:

First term: (kA²)/(2mc²) *2 = (kA²)/(mc²)

Second term: (kA²)/(2mc²) * (kA²)/(2mc²) = (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )

So the

---------------

 numerator inside the sqrt becomes (kA²)/(mc²) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )

Hmm

---------------

, but this might not help. Alternatively, perhaps we can write the entire expression as:

v/c = sqrt( [ (kA²/(2mc²)) * (2 + (kA²)/(2mc²) ) ] ) / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²) )

Let me write

---------------

 numerator sqrt term as sqrt( [ (kA²/(2mc²)) * (2 + (kA²)/(2mc²) ) ] )

Let

---------------

 me factor out the (kA²)/(2mc²) term:

Let me denote ε = (kA²)/(2mc²). Then the

---------------

 numerator is sqrt( ε (2 + ε) ), and denominator is (1 + ε).

So the expression becomes sqrt( ε (2 + ε) ) / (1 + ε )

Hmm. Let me see if this can be rewritten

---------------

 as sqrt( (2ε + ε²) ) / (1 + ε )

Yes, because ε*(2 + ε) is 2ε + ε². So sqrt

---------------

(2ε + ε²) over (1 + ε).

Alternatively, perhaps factor numerator and denominator:

sqrt( ε (2 + ε) ) / (1 + ε )

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 split the fraction:

sqrt( ε/(1 + ε) ) * sqrt( (2 + ε)/(1 + ε) )

Not sure if that helps. Let me see

---------------

 the options again.

Looking back at the options:

Option D is v_max = c sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))^

---------------

2] )

Wait, let me compute that. Let me see:

The expression inside the sqrt for option D is 1 - [1/(1 + ε)^2], where ε = (kA²)/(2mc²). So

---------------

 that would be:

sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + ε)^2 )

Which is similar to my previous calculation

---------------

. Let's see:

In my calculation, v/c = sqrt( (2ε + ε²)/(1 + ε)^2 )

Which

---------------

 is sqrt( [ (2ε + ε²) ] ) / (1 + ε )

But 2ε + ε² = ε(2 + ε)

---------------

 

Alternatively, let me compute the expression in option D's sqrt:

Inside sqrt: 1 - [1/(1 + ε)^2 ] 

Which

---------------

 is the same as ( (1 + ε)^2 -1 ) / (1 + ε)^2 

Expanding numerator: 1 + 2ε + ε² -1 = 2ε + ε² 

So,

---------------

 that gives (2ε + ε²)/(1 + ε)^2, so sqrt of that is sqrt(2ε + ε²)/(1 + ε),

---------------

 which is exactly what I had for v/c. Therefore, option D is the same as the expression I derived. Wait, but

---------------

 the question is to find v_max. 

Wait, so according to this, the answer would be D?

Wait, but let me check again

---------------

. The expression in option D is written as:

c multiplied by sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))^2 ])

---------------

 

Yes. So that's exactly what I got. So that would be D. 

But let me check the other options again to be sure. 

Option B was

---------------

 v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2)/(2mc^2)) )

Wait, the

---------------

 inside of the sqrt here is 1 + [1/(1 - x)], where x is (kA²)/(2mc²). That

---------------

 would be ( (1 -x) + 1 )/(1 -x) ) = (2 -x)/(1 -x). The

---------------

 sqrt of that would be different. 

Option A has similar terms but with a square in the denominator's denominator. Not sure.

Option C is the classical answer, so that

---------------

's out because it's non-relativistic. 

So, the correct answer should be D?

Wait, but let me make

---------------

 sure I didn't mix up any steps. Let me recap.

We started by saying that at maximum displacement, all energy is potential, which is (1/2)kA². At

---------------

 equilibrium, all energy is kinetic, which is (gamma -1)mc². Therefore, (gamma -1)mc² = (1/2)kA².

---------------

 

Then, gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²). 

Then, since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), solving

---------------

 for v gives the equation leading to D. 

Therefore, the correct answer is D. 

Wait, but let me check another

---------------

 approach. Maybe energy is total relativistic energy. Wait, in some formulations, the total energy is gamma mc² + potential energy. So

---------------

 when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, velocity is 0, so gamma is 1, so total energy would be (1/2)kA² + mc². Then

---------------

 at equilibrium, x=0, potential is zero, so total energy is gamma mc² = (1/2)kA² + mc². Then

---------------

 gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²), which is the same as before. 

Therefore, the

---------------

 same result. 

Therefore, the correct answer is D. 

Wait, but let me check the options again. 

Option D says

---------------

 v_max = c sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))²]² ?



---------------

Wait, no, let me look at the exact wording. 

Wait, the options: 

D) v_max= c√

---------------

[1−1/(1+ (kA²)/(2mc²))^2 ]

Yes. So the expression inside the sqrt is 1 minus [1 over (1 + (

---------------

kA²/(2mc²)))^2]. Which is exactly what I derived. So that's correct. 

So the answer should be D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator, we start by considering energy conservation. At maximum displacement \( A \), the kinetic energy is zero, and the total energy is the potential energy \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). At equilibrium (\( x = 0 \)), all energy is kinetic. The relativistic kinetic energy is \( (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Setting the total energy equal to the potential energy at maximum displacement:

\[
(\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]

Solving for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Let \( \epsilon = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Rearranging gives:

\[
\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \epsilon}
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
1 - \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{(1 + \epsilon)^2}
\]

Solving for \( v_{\text{max}} \):

\[
\frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \epsilon)^2}
\]

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}
\]

This matches option D.
