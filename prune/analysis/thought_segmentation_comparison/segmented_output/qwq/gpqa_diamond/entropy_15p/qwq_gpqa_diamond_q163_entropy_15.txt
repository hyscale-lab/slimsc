Okay, so I have this question about binary star systems and their masses. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is asking by what factor system 1 is more massive than system 2. The options are given, so I need to calculate the mass of each system and then find the ratio.

First, I remember that in binary systems, the orbital

---------------

 period and the radial velocity amplitudes are related to the masses of the stars. Oh right, Kepler's third law comes into play here. The formula that

---------------

 relates the masses, the orbital period, and the velocity amplitudes... I think it's something like (M1 + M2) * (a

---------------

1 + a2)^3 = (4π²/G) * P², but maybe there's a simpler version when considering the radial velocity curves

---------------

.

Wait, another approach: the masses of the stars can be found using the radial velocity semi-amplitude formula. The formula for each star's mass in terms of their velocities and the orbital period. Let me recall.

---------------

 The radial velocity amplitude of each star is proportional to their mass and inversely proportional to the total mass of the system. 



---------------

The formula for the mass of each star is something like M1 = (v1 * P * sin i) / (2π * G)^(1/3) * ... Hmm, maybe I need to use the fact

---------------

 that the ratio of the masses is inversely proportional to the ratio of their velocity amplitudes. Because M1/M2 = (v2/v1) * (sin i2/sin i1), but assuming that the inclination angles (i) are the same for both systems, since they

---------------

 both undergo eclipses, which implies that they are edge-on (so sin i =1). So maybe the inclination terms cancel out when comparing the two systems?

Alternatively, the

---------------

 total mass of the system can be related to the velocity amplitudes and the orbital period. Let me think of the formula for the total mass. The

---------------

 combined mass (M1 + M2) of a binary system can be found using the formula involving the velocity amplitudes (K1 and K2), the orbital period P, and the gravitational constant. 

The key formula

---------------

 here is probably the one that comes from Kepler's third law and the definition of the radial velocities. Let me recall that for a binary system, the masses

---------------

 can be expressed in terms of their velocities. The relation is M1/M2 = K2/K1, where K1 and K2 are the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars. So

---------------

 the mass ratio is inversely proportional to the velocity ratio.

But the question is about the total mass of each system. Let

---------------

's see. The total mass (M_total = M1 + M2) can be found using Kepler's third law.

---------------

 The formula is (M1 + M2) * sin^3i = ( (4π²/G) ) * (a1 + a2)^3 / P².

---------------

 Wait, maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, using the velocity amplitudes and the period, there's a formula for the total mass.

Another

---------------

 approach: the radial velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 are related to the masses via K1 = (v Orb

---------------

ital of star 2) and K2 = (v Orbital of star 1). Since the orbital velocities are related to the masses and

---------------

 the separation. Let's think of the masses and velocities. The centripetal acceleration for each star is provided by the gravitational force. So for star 1, M1 * v1² / r1 = G M_total / r1². Wait, maybe it

---------------

's better to use the formula that combines everything.

The formula for the total mass of the binary system is given by:

M_total = ( (K1 * K2 * P * (sin i)^3 ) / (2π G) )^(3

---------------

/3) ? Hmm, maybe I need to look for a standard formula here. Alternatively, I remember that the mass function is often

---------------

 used in radial velocity studies. The mass function for each star is f(m) = (M * sin^3i)/( (1 + q)^2 ), where q is the mass ratio (M2/M1). But perhaps

---------------

 this is getting too complicated.

Wait, maybe the key is that since both systems are eclipsing binaries, the inclination is 90 degrees, so sin i = 1. So

---------------

 we can ignore that term. Also, the formula for the total mass can be written in terms of the velocity amplitudes and the orbital period. Let me think

---------------

 of the formula:

The total mass (M1 + M2) is proportional to (K1^3 + K2^3)^(

---------------

something) over the period squared? Hmm, perhaps I need to consider the relation between the velocity semi-amplitudes and the masses.

Let me recall

---------------

 that the velocity semi-amplitude of each star is given by K1 = (2π a2)/(P) and K2 = (2π a1)/(P), where a1 and a2 are the semi-major axes of each star's orbit. Since a1 + a2 = a (the separation between the two stars), but in

---------------

 the case of a binary system, the semi-major axes are related to the masses. The ratio a1/a2 = M2/M1. Because the

---------------

 center of mass is located at a point dividing the line between the two stars in the ratio of their masses. So a1 =

---------------

 (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a, and a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) * a.

So

---------------

, substituting into K1 and K2:

K1 = (2π a2)/P = (2π ( (M1/(M1 + M2)) * a )) / P

Similarly, K2 = (2π a1)/P = (2π ( (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a )) / P

So

---------------

 the ratio K1/K2 = (a2/a1) = (M1/M2). Which gives M1/M2 = K1/K2. So

---------------

 that's the mass ratio.

But how do we get the total mass?

Alternatively, the total mass can be found using Kepler's third law.

---------------

 The formula is:

(M1 + M2) = ( (a1 + a2)^3 * (2π / P)^2 ) / (G) )

---------------

 ?

Wait, Kepler's third law in the form (M1 + M2) = (4π² / (G P²)) * (a)^3, where a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. But a

---------------

 here is the separation between the two stars. Since a1 + a2 = a, where a1 and a2 are the semi-major axes of each star's orbit around the center of mass. 

So

---------------

, if I can express a in terms of the velocities. Let's see:

We have K1 = (2π a2)/P and

---------------

 K2 = (2π a1)/P. Since a1 + a2 = a, then a = (a1 + a2).

Also

---------------

, since a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a, and a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) * a. 

So

---------------

, substituting into K1 and K2:

K1 = 2π/(P) * (M1/(M1 + M2)) * a 

Similarly, K2 = 2π/(P) * (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a 

Therefore

---------------

, if we take K1 * K2 = (2π/(P))^2 * (M1 M2)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ) * a² 

Hmm, but

---------------

 perhaps we can find (M1 + M2) in terms of K1 and K2 and P?

Let me think

---------------

 of the total mass formula again. Let me recall that the formula for the total mass in terms of the velocity amplitudes and period is

---------------

 given by:

(M1 + M2) = ( (K1^3 + K2^3) * P^2 ) / (2 G π^2 )

---------------

^(something) ?

Wait, maybe I should approach it using Kepler's third law directly. Let's consider the formula:

The orbital period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed divided by the total mass. The

---------------

 exact formula is:

P² = (4 π² / G (M1 + M2)) * a³ 

So rearranged, (M1 + M2) = (4 π² a³ )/( G P² )

But

---------------

 we need to express a in terms of the velocities. Let's see, from the expressions for K1 and K2.



---------------

Alternatively, let's find expressions for a1 and a2 in terms of K1 and K2.

From above, K1 = (2 π a2)/(P).

---------------

 So a2 = (K1 P)/(2 π). Similarly, a1 = (K2 P)/(2 π). Therefore

---------------

, the total separation a = a1 + a2 = (K1 + K2) P/(2 π).

Sub

---------------

stitute that into the Kepler's third law equation:

(M1 + M2) = (4 π² a³ )/( G P² )

Plugging in a = (K1 + K2) P/(2 π):

(M

---------------

1 + M2) = (4 π² ) / (G P² ) * [ ( (K1 + K2) P / (2 π) )^3 ]

Let me compute this step by step:

First, a

---------------

³ = [ (K1 + K2) P/(2π) ]^3 

Multiply by 4 π² / (G P²):

4 π² / (G P²) * [ (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π^3) ) ]

S

---------------

implify numerator and denominator:

4 π² * (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 / (8 π^3 G P² )

The

---------------

 P terms: P^3 / P^2 = P

The π terms: π² / π^3 = 1/π

So overall

---------------

:

(4 / 8) * (K1 + K2)^3 * P / ( G π )

Simplify 4/8 to 1/2:

So

---------------

 ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 G π )

Wait, but that seems a

---------------

 bit complicated. Let me check again.

Wait, let me recalculate:

The a³ term is [(K1 + K2) P/(2π)]^3 = (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 / (8 π^3 )

Multiply by 4 π² / (G P²):

So

---------------

 the total becomes:

4 π² * (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 / (8 π^3 G P² )

The

---------------

 P^3 / P^2 is P^1.

The π² / π^3 is 1/π.

So

---------------

 4/(8) = 0.5, so:

( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 π G )

Hmm, so

---------------

:

M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2 π G )

Wait, but that

---------------

 formula seems to have units? Let me check the units. K is in km/s, which is m/s. P is in years, but we

---------------

 need to convert to seconds. Hmm, maybe this approach is getting too tangled. Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the mass is proportional to (K1^3 + K2^3) * P^something. Wait

---------------

, but perhaps I should use the relation that the total mass is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 * P over

---------------

 something. Alternatively, since I might be overcomplicating, maybe there's a simpler way using the fact that the mass

---------------

 is proportional to (K1^3 + K2^3) * P^something. 

Alternatively, since both systems are eclipsing, we

---------------

 can assume that sin i =1, so the inclination factor is accounted for. Let me think of the mass function. Wait, the mass function for a binary star is f(m) = (M sin^3 i)/( (1 + q)^2 ), where q is the mass ratio. But maybe

---------------

 since we have both velocity amplitudes, we can get the total mass.

Alternatively, let me think of the formula for the total

---------------

 mass in terms of the velocity amplitudes and the period. Let me see if there's a formula that can be derived

---------------

 from the equations.

We have K1 = (2π a2)/P, so a2 = (K1 P)/(2π). Similarly, a1 = (K2 P)/(2π). Since

---------------

 a1 + a2 = a, the separation between the stars.

From Kepler's third law, (M1 + M2) = (4 π² a³)/(G P² )

Sub

---------------

stituting a = a1 + a2 = (K1 + K2) P/(2π):

So,

M_total = (4 π² / (G P² )) * [ ( (K1 + K2) P/(2 π) )^3 ]

Let me compute that:



---------------

Expand the cube: ( (K1+K2)^3 P^3 ) / ( 8 π^3 )

Multiply by 4 π² / (G P² ):

So

---------------

,

4 π² * (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 / (8 π^3 G P² ) 

Simplify terms

---------------

:

4/(8) = 1/2

P^3/P^2 = P

π² / π^3 = 1/π

Thus,

( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 π G )

Hmm, so the formula is M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2 π G )

But to

---------------

 find the mass, we need to plug in the constants, but maybe since we are comparing the two systems, the constants will cancel out when taking the ratio.

So

---------------

 let's denote for system 1 and system 2:

M1_total = ( (K1a + K1b)^3 * P1 ) / (2 π G )

M2_total = ( (K2a + K2b)^3 * P2 ) / (2 π G )

Therefore

---------------

, the ratio M1_total / M2_total = [ (K1a + K1b)^3 * P1 ] / [ (K2a + K2b)^3 * P2 ]

Because the denomin

---------------

ators (2π G) cancel out.

So now plug in the given values.

For system 1: the RV amplitudes are 10 and 5 km/s. So K1a =10, K1b=5. So

---------------

 their sum is 15 km/s.

The period P1 is 2 years.

For system 2: RV amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s. Sum is 25 km/s. Period P2 is 1 year.

So pl

---------------

ugging into the ratio:

( (15)^3 * 2 ) / ( (25)^3 * 1 )

Let me compute that.

First, 15^3 = 3375; 25^3 = 15625

So numerator: 3375 * 2 = 6750

Denominator: 15625 * 1 = 15625

So

---------------

 the ratio is 6750 / 15625.

Let me compute that division:

6750 divided by 15625.

Well

---------------

, let's see:

15625 × 0.4 = 6250

6750 - 6250 = 500



---------------

So 0.4 + (500/15625) = 0.4 + 0.032 = 0.432.



---------------

Wait, 500/15625 = (500 ÷ 25)/(15625 ÷25) = 20 / 625 = 0.032.

So total ratio is 0.432,

---------------

 approximately 0.43.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.4. Option B is ~0.6. The answer

---------------

 would be closest to 0.4, so option A?

Wait, but let me check my steps again. Did I mix

---------------

 up the systems?

Wait, the question is asking "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So the ratio M1/M2 is

---------------

 0.43, so system1 is 0.43 times as massive as system2, which would mean system1 is less massive. But the options include 0.4 as

---------------

 A, so that's possible. But let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait the formula was

---------------

:

M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2 π G )

So the ratio M

---------------

1/M2 = [ (K1_sum)^3 * P1 ] / [ (K2_sum)^3 * P2 ]

Yes

---------------

, that's correct. So with the numbers:

K1_sum for system1: 10+5=15,

---------------

 system2:15+10=25.

So (15/25)^3 * (2/1) = ( (3/5)^3 ) *2.



---------------

Compute (3/5)^3 = 27/125 ≈0.216. Multiply by 2 gives ~0.432. So indeed

---------------

 ~0.43, which is closest to option A, 0.4.

But wait, the options are A

---------------

) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, etc. So the answer would be A?

Wait, but maybe

---------------

 I inverted the ratio?

Wait, the question is "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So if M1 is 0.43 times M2, then system1 is 0.43 times as massive as system2, so system2 is more massive. But

---------------

 the question is asking how much more massive system1 is than system2. So that would be a factor less than 1, but

---------------

 the answer would be 0.43, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

---------------

 Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider that the mass is proportional to (K1^3 + K2^3) * P?

---------------

 Or perhaps the formula is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the individual velocity amplitudes and mass ratios.

Wait

---------------

, let's try another method. Since the mass ratio is M1/M2 = K2/K1 (since K1 is proportional to M2 and K2 proportional to M1).

---------------

 Let's see.

In system1, the two stars have velocities 10 and 5. So the mass ratio M1/M2 = (5)/(10) = 0.5. So M1 =0.5 M2. So

---------------

 the total mass of system1 is M1 + M2 = 1.5 M2. Wait, but then how

---------------

 do I get the total mass in terms of the period and velocities?

Alternatively, let's denote for system1:

Let the

---------------

 masses be M1 and M2 (same as the system's stars). Their velocity amplitudes are K1 =10 and K2=5. The

---------------

 mass ratio M1/M2 = K2/K1 = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 =0.5 M2. Total

---------------

 mass M_total1 = M1 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

Similarly, for system2, the

---------------

 masses are m1 and m2, with K1=15 and K2=10. So mass ratio m1/m2 =10/15 = 2/3. So m1 = (2/3)m2. Total mass m

---------------

_total2 = m1 + m2 = (5/3)m2.

Now, to find the total masses, we need to relate them to the orbital period.

---------------

 Let's use Kepler's third law for each system.

For system1:

(M_total1) * a^3 = (4π²/G) P1²



---------------

Similarly for system2:

(M_total2) * a^3 = (4π²/G) P2²

Wait, but the

---------------

 separation a is different for each system. So unless we can relate the separations, this might not help. Alternatively, using

---------------

 the velocity amplitudes.

We can relate the velocity amplitudes to the masses and the orbital period. Let's recall

---------------

 that the velocity amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2 π a)/(P) * (M_other

---------------

 / M_total)

Wait, for star1, its velocity is v1 = (2π a1)/P. Since

---------------

 a1 is the semi-major axis of star1's orbit around the center of mass. And a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a_total, where a_total is the separation between the stars.

So

---------------

 v1 = 2π/(P) * (M2/(M_total)) * a_total.

But the total separation a_total = a1 + a2 = (M2/(M_total))a_total + (M1/(M_total))a_total = a_total.

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 another way. Let's write the velocity amplitude K1 (for star1) as:

K1 = (2 π a1)/P =

---------------

 (2 π/(P)) * ( (M2/(M_total)) * a_total )

But a_total is the separation

---------------

 between the stars, which is a1 + a2. But also, from Kepler's third law, a_total^3 = (G M_total P²)/(4 π²).



---------------

So substituting a_total = [ (G M_total P²)/(4 π²) ]^(1/3)

Hmm

---------------

, substituting into K1:

K1 = (2 π / P) * ( M2/(M_total) ) * [ (G M_total P²)/(4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify:



---------------

Let me write this step by step:

Let me denote a_total = [ (G M_total P²)/(4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

Thus,

K1 = (2 π / P) * (M2 / M_total) * a_total 

Substituting a_total:

K1 = (2 π / P) * (M2 / M_total) * [ (G M_total P²)/(4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

Let me simplify the terms inside:

Let

---------------

 me compute the exponents. Let's first compute the term [ (G M_total P²)/(4 π²) ]^(1/3 )



---------------

Let me write all terms:

Multiply (2 π / P) with the a_total term:

So:

K1 = (2 π / P) * (M2 / M_total) * [ (G M_total P² )

---------------

 / (4 π²) ]^{1/3}

Let me break this down:

First, let's compute the constants:

The constants

---------------

 inside the cube root:

The term inside the cube root is (G M_total P²)/(4 π²).

Let me handle

---------------

 each part step by step. Let's compute the entire expression:

Let me write all terms multiplied together:

The constants:

2 π / P multiplied by [ (G M_total P²)/(

---------------

4 π²) ]^{1/3}

Let me separate the terms with M_total, P, and constants.

First, let

---------------

's handle the M_total terms:

The M_total in the numerator from (M2/M_total) and the cube root term

---------------

's M_total^(1/3):

So overall, M_total terms: (M2 / M_total) * (M_total)^{1/3} = M2 * M_total^{-2/3}

The

---------------

 P terms:

P in the denominator from (2π/P) and the cube root term has P² inside, so when

---------------

 taken to the 1/3, that's P^(2/3). So overall P terms: (1/P) * P^(2/3) = P^{-1 + 2/3} = P^{-1/3}

The G term:

---------------

 G^{1/3}

The π terms: 2 π from the first term, and (4 π²)^{-1/3} from the cube root:



---------------

2 π * (4 π²)^{-1/3} 

Let me compute that:

2 / (4^{1/3}) ) * π / (π^{2/3}) ) 

4

---------------

^{1/3} is 2^(2/3), so 2 / 2^(2/3) = 2^{1 - 2/3} = 2^(1/3)

Similarly, π / π^{2/3} = π^{1 - 2/3} = π^{1/3}

Thus, the constants become

---------------

 2^(1/3) * π^{1/3}

Putting all together:

K1 = [ 2^(1/3) * π^{1/3} ] * [ G^{1/3} ] * [ M2 * M_total^{-2/3} ] * [ P^{-1/3} ]

Hmm

---------------

, this is getting complicated. Let me see if I can rearrange terms to solve for M_total.

Alternatively, perhaps it

---------------

's better to consider that the product K1 * K2 is related to the masses and period. Let's see:

We

---------------

 have K1 = (2 π a2)/(P) and K2 = (2 π a1)/(P). The

---------------

 product K1*K2 = (4 π² a1 a2)/P².

But a1 * a2 = (M1/(M_total)) a_total * (M2/(M_total)) a_total = (M1 M2)/(M_total²) * a_total².

Hmm

---------------

, not sure.

Alternatively, let me try to find an expression for M_total in terms of K1, K2, and P.

From

---------------

 the previous formula where M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P )/(2 π G )

Wait, but

---------------

 if that's the case, then the ratio would be as I calculated before, 0.43. So the answer is A?



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the formula derivation.

Wait let me check with another approach. Let's consider the formula

---------------

 for the mass of a binary system in terms of the velocity amplitudes. 

The formula for the total mass is given

---------------

 by:

M_total = ( (K1^3 + K2^3) * P^2 ) / ( (

---------------

2 π G)^{something} ) ?

Wait, perhaps I need to refer to the standard formula for the mass of a binary system.

---------------

 

The formula I found in some references: The total mass of the binary system is given by:

M_total = ( (K1^3 + K2^3) * P^2 ) / ( (2

---------------

 π G)^{-1} * a^something ) )

Hmm, perhaps another way. Let me recall that in a binary system, the radial

---------------

 velocity semi-amplitudes are related to the masses and the orbital period. 

Alternatively, let me consider that the mass is

---------------

 proportional to (K^3 * P), where K is the velocity amplitude, but that might be in a different context. 

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 I can use the formula for each star's mass.

For each star, the mass is given by:

M1 = (K2 * P^

---------------

2 * (a_total)^3 ) / (2 π G * something )

Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, let me think

---------------

 of the two stars in system1. Let me assign variables:

Let M1 and M2 be the masses of the two stars in system1. Their velocities are K1 =10 and K2=5.

---------------

 The period is 2 years.

The mass ratio is M1/M2 = K2/K1 = 5/10 = 0.5 ⇒

---------------

 M1 = 0.5 M2.

Total mass M_total1 = M1 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

Similarly

---------------

, for system2, the masses are m1 and m2 with K1=15 and K2=10. So m1/m2 = 10/15 = 2/3 ⇒ m1 = (2/3)m2. Total mass M_total2 = m1 + m2 = (5/3)m2.

Now, to

---------------

 find the total masses, we need to relate them to the orbital periods. 

Using Kepler's third law for each system:

For system1:

(M_total1) * a^3 = (4 π² / G) * P1² 

Similarly for system2:

(M_total2) * a'^3 = (4 π² / G) * P2² 

Where a and a' are the semi

---------------

-major axes of the orbits (the separation between the stars in each system).

But we need to relate the separations a and a' to the velocity amplitudes. 

We

---------------

 can find the separation a in terms of the velocity and mass. Let me think of the velocity amplitude for star1 in system1:

K1 = (2 π a2)/P1, where a2 is the semi-major axis of star2's orbit. 

But

---------------

 a2 = (M1/(M_total1)) * a_total (since a_total = a1 + a2, and the center of mass divides the distance in the ratio of the masses).

Wait

---------------

, a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) * a_total. 

Similarly, a1 = (M2/(M_total1)) * a_total.

Thus

---------------

, K1 = (2 π / P1) * a2 = (2 π / P1) * (M1/(M_total1)) * a_total.

But M

---------------

1 = 0.5 M2, so M_total1 = 1.5 M2. Thus, M1/(M_total1) = (0.5 M2)/(1.5 M2) = 1/3.

Therefore, K1 = (2 π / P1) * (1/3) * a_total.

Similarly

---------------

, K2 = (2 π / P1) * (M2/(M_total1)) * a_total = (2 π / P1)*( (M2)/(1.5 M2) ) * a_total = (2 π / P1)*(2/3) *a_total.

Given

---------------

 that K1 is 10 km/s and K2 is 5 km/s, so indeed 1/3 *

---------------

 a_total * (2π/P1) = 10, and 2/3 * a_total * (2π/P1) = 5. Which

---------------

 checks out because the ratio K2/K1 = (2/3)/(1/3) = 2, but wait

---------------

, K2 is 5 and K1 is 10, so ratio is 0.5. Wait that contrad

---------------

icts. Wait wait, no.

Wait K2 is the velocity of star2, which is 5 km/s. K

---------------

1 is star1's velocity, which is 10. So K2/K1 =0.5. Which matches the mass ratio M1/M2 =0.5. So that's correct.

So

---------------

, from K1 = (2 π / P1) * (M1 / M_total1) * a_total



---------------

We can solve for a_total:

a_total = (K1 * P1 * M_total1 )/( 2 π M1 )

Sub

---------------

stituting M1 = 0.5 M2, M_total1 =1.5 M2:

a_total = (10 km/s * 2 years * 1.5 M2 )/( 2 π * 0.5 M2 )

The M2 terms cancel out. 



---------------

Wait, but the units here are mixed (km/s and years). Hmm, perhaps this is getting too involved. But since

---------------

 we are taking the ratio between the two systems, maybe the actual numerical values of G and the unit conversions will cancel out.

Alternatively, let's plug

---------------

 a_total into Kepler's third law for system1:

M_total1 * a_total^3 = (4 π² / G) * P1²

We

---------------

 can solve for M_total1:

M_total1 = (4 π² / G) * P1² / a_total^3 

But from the expression

---------------

 for a_total:

a_total = (K1 * P1 * M_total1 )/( 2 π M1 )

So

---------------

 substituting into a_total^3:

a_total^3 = [ (K1 P1 M_total1)/(2 π M1) ]^3 

Thus

---------------

, substituting into M_total1 equation:

M_total1 = (4 π² / G) * P1² / [ (K1 P1 M_total1 / (2 π M1 ))^3 ]

Multiply both sides by denominator:

M_total1 * (K1^3 P1^3 M_total1^3 / (2 π M1)^3 ) ) = (4 π² / G) P1² 

Hmm

---------------

, getting very tangled. Maybe this approach isn't the best.

Perhaps going back to the initial approach with the ratio is better.

The

---------------

 key formula I derived earlier was:

M_total1 / M_total2 = [ (K1a + K1b)^3 * P1 ] / [ (K2a + K2b)^3 * P2 ]

Pl

---------------

ugging the numbers:

(15^3 * 2 ) / (25^3 * 1 )

15^3 is 3375, 25^3 is 15625. So 3375*2 = 6750 divided

---------------

 by 15625 gives 0.432, which is approximately 0.4. So the answer should be A) ~0.4.

Wait

---------------

 but let me check if the formula was correct. Let me think again of the formula for the total mass.

The formula I

---------------

 had was:

M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2 π G )

Is

---------------

 that correct?

Wait let me re-derive it quickly.

We had:

From Kepler's third law: M_total = (4 π² a³)/( G P² )

And

---------------

 a = a1 + a2 = (K1 P)/(2 π) + (K2 P)/(2 π) ) = P/(2 π) (K1 + K2 )

So a = (K1 + K2) P/(2 π )

So

---------------

 a³ = (K1 + K2)^3 P³/( 8 π³ )

Plugging into M_total:

M_total = (4 π² / G P² ) * [ (K1+K2)^3 P³/(8 π^3) ) ]

Multiply

---------------

 terms:

4 π² * (K1+K2)^3 P³ / (8 π³ G P² )

Simplify:



---------------

4/(8) = 0.5

P³ / P² = P

π² / π³ = 1/π

Thus,

---------------

 M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 π G )

Yes, that's

---------------

 correct. So the formula is correct.

Therefore, the ratio is indeed (15^3 *2)/(25^3 *1) = (3375*2)/(15625) = 6750/15625 = 0.432,

---------------

 which is approximately 0.4. So answer A.

But wait, the options are A ~0.4, B ~0.6. So

---------------

 the answer must be A. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the velocity addition? Let me check the given data

---------------

 again.

The question says for system1, the RV amplitudes are 10 and 5. So sum is 15. System2 has 15 and 10, so sum is 25. That

---------------

's correct. Periods are 2 and 1. So the calculation is correct. 

Hmm. So I think the correct answer is A.


The problem

---------------

 requires calculating the mass ratio between two binary star systems using their orbital periods and radial velocity amplitudes. For system_1, the radial

---------------

 velocities are 10 km/s and 5 km/s, summing to 15 km/s, with a period of 2 years. For system_2, the velocities are 15 km/s and 10 km/s, summing to 25 km/s, with a period of 1 year. 

The total mass of a binary system is given by \( M_{\text{total}} \propto \frac{(K_1 + K_2)^3 \cdot P}{\text{constant}} \). The ratio of the masses of system_1 to system_2 is:

\[
\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{(15)^3 \cdot 2}{(25)^3 \cdot 1} = \frac{3375 \cdot 2}{15625} = \frac{6750}{15625} \approx 0.432
\]

This value is closest to option A (~0.4).
