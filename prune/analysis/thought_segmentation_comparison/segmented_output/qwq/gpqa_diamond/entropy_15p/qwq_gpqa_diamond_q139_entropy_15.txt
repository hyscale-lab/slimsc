Okay, let's try to tackle this question step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying Substance X and then calculating the sum of the atomic masses of its lightest and heaviest elements. Let me start

---------------

 by breaking down the information given.

First, the problem mentions that Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. That

---------------

 might be a clue about which element is present. Also, when X reacts with liquid Y, it produces gas W and precipitate G. Gas W's molecules have the same number of neutrons and protons. Since protons determine the element, the number of protons equals the atomic number. Ne

---------------

utrons plus protons equal the mass number. So, if neutrons = protons, then the mass number must be twice the atomic number. Let's think of elements where this

---------------

 is true. For example, hydrogen (1 proton, 0 neutrons) doesn't fit. Helium has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (mass 4), so that's 2 each. Wait

---------------

, helium-4 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So gas W could be helium? But helium is a noble gas, not

---------------

 sure if that's common in such reactions. Alternatively, maybe hydrogen? Wait, hydrogen's most common isotope is 1H (no neutrons). But

---------------

 maybe another isotope? Wait, the problem says the molecule's atoms each have equal protons and neutrons. So each atom in the molecule must satisfy that. Let me think of

---------------

 possible gases.

Another possibility: hydrogen gas (H2) would have each H atom with 1 proton and 1 neutron?

---------------

 Wait, but the common isotope is 1H (no neutrons). So unless it's deuterium (²H, which has 1 proton and 1 neutron). So if the gas is de

---------------

uterium gas (D2), then each atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. That would fit. So maybe W is D2? But

---------------

 then the reaction would produce deuterium gas. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something like methane? Let's see, methane

---------------

 (CH4) has carbon (6 protons, 6 neutrons in 12C, but 12C has 6 each, so that

---------------

 would work. Wait, if the molecule is CH4, then the carbon would have 6 protons and 6 neutrons (so

---------------

 12C), and each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. Wait, but then the H's

---------------

 don't satisfy the neutron = proton condition. So maybe the gas is something else.

Wait, maybe the gas is hydrogen,

---------------

 but with deuterium? Let me think again. The problem says "the molecule contains the same number of protons and neutrons". So each

---------------

 atom in the molecule must have equal protons and neutrons. Let's think of possible molecules. For example, He (

---------------

helium-4) has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, so a helium atom would fit. If the gas is He, then that

---------------

's possible. Alternatively, maybe hydrogen with deuterium (so each H is deuterium). Then H2 would have each atom

---------------

 with 1 proton and 1 neutron, so that works. So the gas W could be D2 (deuterium gas), or

---------------

 maybe He?

Now, the precipitate G forms and when heated releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. Let's note

---------------

 that 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius (since 273.15 is 0°C, so 277 is ~

---------------

4.85°C). So B has a melting point near 5°C. That's close to the melting point of water

---------------

 (0°C) but a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe B is something like paraffin wax, but that's lower

---------------

. Wait, perhaps it's the melting point of something like a metal? Wait, maybe B is sodium acetate? Its

---------------

 melting point is around 135°C, no. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's something like sodium chloride? No

---------------

, that's 801°C. Wait, maybe the substance B is something else. Wait, perhaps B is a

---------------

 common substance. Wait, 277 K is 4.85°C. That's just above freezing point of water. Maybe

---------------

 B is a substance that melts just above room temperature? Wait, no, 4°C is near water's freezing point. Alternatively

---------------

, maybe the substance is a fat or something, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is a metal with a low melting point. Let

---------------

 me think of elements with low melting points. Mercury melts at -38.83°C, which is way too low. Gallium melts at ~29°C. Hmm

---------------

, maybe that's not it. Alternatively, maybe B is a compound. Let's think of the precipitate G. When heated, it releases B. So

---------------

 G might be a carbonate or something that decomposes when heated. For example, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) when heated releases

---------------

 CO2 and CaO. But then B would be CaO? But CaO's melting point is 2613°C, which is way too high. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the precipitate is a metal

---------------

 hydroxide? For instance, if the reaction produces Mg(OH)2, heating it would release water and leave MgO. But again, Mg

---------------

O's melting point is around 2852°C. Not matching. Alternatively, maybe the precipitate is something like ammon

---------------

ium carbonate, which when heated releases NH3 and CO2? But then B could be one of those, but their melting points are

---------------

 lower. Wait, maybe B is a gas? The question says "melting point of B", so it's a solid.

---------------

 Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps B is a substance like camphor, which has a melting point around 176°C. No

---------------

. Wait, maybe the precipitate G is a metal oxide that when heated releases a gas. Hmm, maybe I'm getting

---------------

 ahead of myself here.

Let me go back to Substance X. The question says that X reacts with liquid Y to produce gas W (with equal

---------------

 protons and neutrons per atom) and precipitate G. Also, X's analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. The product of a keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. Hmm

---------------

, the product of a keto acid (like acetoacetic acid, for example) reacting with X... Let me think of common

---------------

 reagents in organic chemistry. One possibility is lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4), but that's a reducing agent. Alternatively

---------------

, maybe it's sodium hydride (NaH) or potassium hydride? Wait, the question mentions a heavier isotope of one of its elements. If

---------------

 X is NaH, then maybe it's using deuterium instead of hydrogen? So if X is NaD (sodium deuteride), then the hy

---------------

dride uses a heavier isotope (deuterium) of hydrogen. That would make sense. 

Wait, sodium hydride (NaH) reacts with water (liquid Y) to produce hydrogen gas (H2) and NaOH (which would be the precipitate?).

---------------

 Wait, but NaOH is soluble in water. Hmm, maybe the reaction is with another liquid. Alternatively, maybe Y is something

---------------

 else. Wait, if the reaction of X (like NaH) with water would produce H2 gas (or D2 if deuterium), and NaOH.

---------------

 But NaOH is a precipitate? No, it's soluble. Hmm, maybe the reaction is with another liquid. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe X is a

---------------

 Grignard reagent? But Grignard reagents are usually organomagnesium halides. But the question says X

---------------

 has a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Let me think of the reaction of a keto acid with X. Keto

---------------

 acids, when treated with Grignard reagents, form tertiary alcohols, but the product would have more oxygen? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction

---------------

 with a hydride reagent. For instance, when a keto acid reacts with a hydride like NaBH4, the

---------------

 product would be a alcohol. Let's see: acetoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH) reacting with NaBH4 would reduce the ketone group

---------------

, but the product would have oxygen. The question says the product has 2 oxygen atoms. The original keto acid has two oxygen atoms (the

---------------

 two carbonyl groups). Wait, maybe after reduction, the oxygen count remains? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is a car

---------------

boxylic acid that loses some oxygen? Not sure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the substance X is lithium

---------------

 aluminum hydride (LiAlH4). The product of a keto acid with LiAlH4 would be a tertiary alcohol. Let's see, the

---------------

 original keto acid (like acetoacetic acid) has two carbonyl groups. Reduction would give two hydroxyl groups, but maybe

---------------

 in the product, the oxygen count is two? Wait, acetoacetic acid has two oxygen atoms (each carbonyl has

---------------

 one, but the carboxylic acid has another? Wait, acetoacetic acid is CH2(CO2H)COCH3. Wait, the

---------------

 structure is CH2(C=O)CO2H? No, actually, acetoacetic acid is CH3COCH2COOH. So that

---------------

's two oxygen atoms (the carbonyl in the ketone and the carboxylic acid). So the carboxylic acid group

---------------

 has two oxygens. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, when reduced by LiAlH4, the ket

---------------

one would become an alcohol, so the product would have an alcohol group (OH) and the carboxylic acid would

---------------

 become a hydroxyl (but maybe that's not the case). Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently.

The problem

---------------

 states that the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So, the

---------------

 product has exactly two oxygen atoms. Let me consider that. Suppose the keto acid has three oxygen atoms (like a diketone?),

---------------

 but the product ends up with two. Or maybe the reaction removes an oxygen. Alternatively, maybe the keto acid is something like pro

---------------

panone (acetone, which has no oxygen except the carbonyl group?), no, acetone has one oxygen. Wait, maybe

---------------

 the keto acid is something like 3-oxobutyric acid (CH2(CO2H)COCH3?),

---------------

 but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction with X (a hydride) reduces the ketone and the carboxylic acid.

---------------

 Let me think of an example. For instance, if the keto acid is acetoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH), reacting

---------------

 with a hydride (like NaBH4), the ketone would be reduced to an alcohol, so the product would be CH3CH(OH)CH2COOH. That

---------------

 still has two oxygen atoms (the carboxylic acid and the hydroxyl). Wait, that's two oxygen atoms?

---------------

 The carboxylic acid has two (the COOH has two oxygens?), yes. Wait, carboxylic acid is

---------------

 -COOH, so that's two oxygen atoms. The hydroxyl is one, so total three? Hmm, maybe not

---------------

. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol or something else. Maybe I need to think of the reagent X.

---------------

 

Alternatively, maybe the substance X is sodium borohydride (NaBH4). But then the product would have two

---------------

 oxygens. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is with a hydride that removes oxygen. Wait, perhaps the product

---------------

 is an alcohol with fewer oxygens. Maybe the keto acid is something like a diketone, which when reduced gives an alcohol with less

---------------

 oxygen. Alternatively, maybe the product is a compound that loses a CO2, but that's more of a decarboxylation. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe X is a metal hydride like LiAlH4. The reaction with a keto acid would reduce the ketone group

---------------

, but the carboxylic acid would remain. So the product would have the carboxylic acid (two oxygens) and the alcohol (one oxygen

---------------

). Wait, that's three. Hmm. 

Wait, the question says the product contains exactly two oxygen atoms. Let me think of another possibility

---------------

. Suppose the keto acid is something like a beta-keto acid, and the reagent X is something like a Grignard reagent. For

---------------

 example, if you have a Grignard reagent reacting with a keto acid, maybe it forms an ester? Not

---------------

 sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is with a base, but I'm getting stuck here.

Let me go back to the other

---------------

 clues. The substance X has an analog used as a reagent in organic chemistry. The analog is probably the common version,

---------------

 not the isotope-heavy one. So if X is sodium deuteride (NaD), then the analog would be sodium hydride (NaH). That

---------------

 fits because they are very close analogs. The reaction of sodium hydride with water (liquid Y) would produce hydrogen gas (H2) and sodium hydroxide. But sodium

---------------

 hydroxide is soluble in water, so maybe the precipitate isn't NaOH. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is with another liquid. Wait

---------------

, if Y is not water but another liquid, perhaps an alcohol or something else. Wait, the problem says liquid Y. Let

---------------

 me think again. The gas W has molecules where each atom has equal protons and neutrons. If the gas is de

---------------

uterium gas (D2), then each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. That would satisfy the condition. So if

---------------

 the reaction of X (NaD) with liquid Y (maybe water?) produces D2 and NaOH (but NaOH is soluble). Hmm

---------------

, maybe the precipitate is something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is with an acid. For example, if Y is an

---------------

 acid, then reacting with NaD would produce hydrogen (or deuterium) gas and a salt. Maybe the precipitate is a carbonate or something.

---------------

 Wait, perhaps the liquid Y is an acid like acetic acid. Then the reaction would produce D2 and sodium acetate. But sodium acetate is soluble. Hmm. Alternatively

---------------

, maybe Y is a different liquid, like a metal chloride solution? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is with liquid

---------------

 ammonia? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a metal oxide? Wait, maybe I should think of the precipitate G. When heated, it releases B. Let

---------------

 me think of the melting point of B being near 277 K (4°C). That's just above freezing point. Maybe

---------------

 B is a substance that melts at that temperature. Wait, maybe B is a substance like naphthalene, which has a melting point around 80°C. No. Alternatively, perhaps it's the

---------------

 melting point of a compound like sodium acetate trihydrate, which has a melting point around 58°C. No. Wait, 

---------------

277 K is 4°C, so maybe B is something that's a solid at room temperature but melts just above water's freezing point. Hmm

---------------

, maybe it's a substance like camphor, but that's higher. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrate.

---------------

 Wait, perhaps B is the precipitate itself? Or the product of heating G. 

Alternatively, the precipitate G could

---------------

 be something like calcium carbonate, which when heated releases CO2 (gas B?), but then B would be CO2 which is a gas. But the question says the melting point of B is near

---------------

 277 K. CO2's melting point is about -56.6°C, so that's way lower. Hmm. 



---------------

Wait, maybe the precipitate G is a metal hydroxide, like Mg(OH)2. When heated, it decomposes to MgO and H2O. So

---------------

 B would be MgO. But MgO's melting point is around 2852°C, which is way too high. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the precipitate is ammonium carbonate, which when heated releases NH3 and CO2, so B would be either

---------------

 of those. But again, their melting points are too low. 

Hmm, maybe I should think of B's melting point.

---------------

 277 K is 4°C. What substance melts around there? Wait, maybe it's the melting point of the

---------------

 compound itself, like a specific compound. Wait, maybe B is a substance like gallium, which melts around 29.76°C. That

---------------

's 300 K, so close to 277? No, that's higher. Wait, maybe it

---------------

's a compound with a low melting point. Alternatively, maybe B is a hydrate, like sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate, which melts around 48°C. Not

---------------

 quite. 

Alternatively, maybe the substance B is the gas W? But the question says the melting point of B is near

---------------

 277 K, so it must be a solid. 

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try

---------------

 to focus on Substance X first. Since the analog of X is used as a reagent, and X has a heavier isotope, perhaps

---------------

 the common analog is NaH (sodium hydride), and X is NaD (sodium deuteride). That

---------------

 makes sense. Then, when X reacts with liquid Y (maybe water), it produces D2 gas (since H2 would be the

---------------

 product with NaH), and sodium hydroxide. But sodium hydroxide is soluble, so maybe the precipitate is something else. Alternatively, if Y is an

---------------

 acid like HCl, then the reaction would produce HCl + NaD → DCl and NaCl? Not sure. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe Y is an alcohol. Sodium hydride reacts with alcohols to form alkoxide salts and hydrogen. For

---------------

 example, NaH + ROH → NaOR + H2. In that case, if X is NaD, then the product would be NaOR and D2 gas. The precipitate might not form here,

---------------

 unless the conditions are different. 

Alternatively, maybe the liquid Y is something like a metal chloride solution. For instance, reacting with MgCl2 solution

---------------

, the hydride could produce Mg(OH)2 precipitate. Let's see: NaH + H2O → NaOH + H2. So in a

---------------

 solution with MgCl2, Mg^2+ and Cl^- would react with OH^- to form Mg(OH)2 precipitate. So then

---------------

 the precipitate G would be Mg(OH)2, which when heated decomposes to MgO and H2O. So B would be MgO. But again

---------------

, MgO's melting point is way too high. Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the precipitate is a carbonate. If

---------------

 the liquid Y is a carbonate solution, like Na2CO3, then reacting with NaH (or NaD) would produce...

---------------

 Not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is between NaD and an ester, but that might not produce a precipitate. 

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps the reaction is between NaD and an acid, like H2O. Let me think again. If Y is water, then the reaction is

---------------

 NaD + H2O → D2↑ + NaOH. The NaOH is soluble, so no precipitate. But

---------------

 the problem states that a precipitate forms. So maybe Y is a different liquid. Maybe Y is a solution containing a metal salt that forms

---------------

 a precipitate when OH- is added. Like if Y is a solution of FeCl3, then adding NaOH would form Fe(OH)3 precipitate. But then

---------------

 the precipitate G would be Fe(OH)3, which when heated releases H2O and Fe2O3. The

---------------

 melting point of Fe2O3 is around 1565°C, which is way too high. 

Hmm. Maybe the liquid

---------------

 Y is a solution of a carbonate, like Na2CO3. Then NaH reacting would produce Na2CO3 + NaH → Na

---------------

HCO3? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a precipitate like a carbonate. 

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a

---------------

 solution of a lead nitrate, so that when NaOH is formed, it reacts with Pb^2+ to form Pb(OH)2 precipitate. Then

---------------

 when heated, Pb(OH)2 decomposes into PbO and H2O. The melting point of PbO is around 888°C. Still too high. 

Hmm

---------------

, perhaps I need to think of the melting point of B being 277 K. Let me see: 277 K is 4°C. What

---------------

 melts around there? Wait, maybe it's the melting point of a specific compound. For example, the melting point of sodium

---------------

 acetate trihydrate is about 58°C. No. Wait, maybe B is a hydrate of something. Alternatively, maybe the substance B is actually

---------------

 a metal with a low melting point. Wait, gallium melts at 29.76°C, which is 

---------------

303 K, close to 277 but not exactly. Hmm. Maybe the question is approximate? Or perhaps I

---------------

'm missing something.

Wait, the problem says "the melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K". Let

---------------

 me think of substances with a melting point near 4°C. Oh! Wait, maybe B is a substance like paraffin wax, but that's more

---------------

 like 30-60°C. Alternatively, maybe it's the melting point of a specific compound. Wait, maybe

---------------

 B is the precipitate G itself when heated, but maybe when heated it sublimes or something. Alternatively, perhaps the substance

---------------

 B is actually the gas W? But the question specifies the melting point of B, so it must be a solid. 

Alternatively, maybe the precip

---------------

itate is something like ammonium chloride, which when heated sublimes, but the melting point is around 337°C. Not helpful

---------------

. 

Alternatively, maybe B is water? But water's melting point is 0°C, which is 273 K. The problem says 277 K, which is 4°C. Close, but not exactly. Hmm. Maybe

---------------

 the question is approximate, and B is water, but then when heated, the precipitate would release water as a gas. Wait

---------------

, the precipitate G when heated releases B, which is a solid. So if G is a hydrate, like copper

---------------

 sulfate pentahydrate, when heated it loses water (B would be water, but water is a liquid at room temp).

---------------

 Not a solid. Hmm. 

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is something like sodium chloride, but when heated, it doesn't decompose. 

Hmm

---------------

, maybe I should move forward with the assumption that X is NaD (sodium deuteride), given the isotopic part

---------------

 and the common reagent analog. Let's see if that works with the other clues. 

The product of a keto acid reacting with X (NaD) has

---------------

 two oxygen atoms. Let's think of the reaction. Sodium deuteride is a strong base and a reducing agent. When

---------------

 reacted with a keto acid, maybe it deprotonates the carboxylic acid to form the conjugate base, but

---------------

 the product would depend on conditions. Alternatively, in a reduction reaction, the ketone group could be reduced. 

Wait, maybe

---------------

 the reaction is a reduction of the keto acid. Let's take acetoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH). If you

---------------

 reduce it with NaBH4 (the analog), you get CH3CH(OH)CH2COOH. That has

---------------

 two oxygen atoms in the carboxylic acid (COOH has two O) and one in the hydroxyl group, totaling three. But

---------------

 the question says the product has two oxygen atoms. Hmm. 

Wait, maybe the reaction is with a different reagent. Suppose

---------------

 X is lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD4). The analog would be LiAlH4. When reacting with a keto acid, the

---------------

 product might have fewer oxygens. Let me think. If the ketone is reduced to an alcohol and the carboxylic acid is also reduced.

---------------

 For example, acetoacetic acid (two carbonyl groups?) Wait, acetoacetic acid has a ketone and a carboxylic acid. Red

---------------

ucing both would give a diol and a CH2 group? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is a diol with two

---------------

 oxygen atoms. Let me think of an example. 

Alternatively, maybe the keto acid is something like a diketone. For instance, acet

---------------

one (propanone) is a ketone but not an acid. Wait, maybe the keto acid is something like 3-oxobutyric acid (CH2(CO2H)COCH3). React

---------------

ing with a reducing agent like NaBH4 might reduce the ketone to an alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid intact. So the product would have the carboxylic acid (two O) and the alcohol (one O), totaling three. Still

---------------

 not two. 

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is with a strong base, causing a decarboxylation. For example, heating

---------------

 a keto acid with a base might remove CO2. Let's see: acetoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH) has

---------------

 two carboxylic groups? Wait, no, the structure is CH2(CO2H)COCH3. So it

---------------

's a beta-keto acid. When treated with a base, maybe it loses CO2. The product would be CH2CH

---------------

2CO2H? Not sure. Wait, decarboxylation of a beta-keto acid gives a ketone. For example, acetoacetic acid (

---------------

CH3COCH2COOH) when decarboxylated becomes acetone (CH3COCH3), which has no oxygen except the ketone's

---------------

. The oxygen count here would be one (the carbonyl). But the problem says the product has two oxygen atoms. Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is

---------------

 a different one. Suppose the keto acid is reacted with X (NaD) in a way that the oxygen count drops. For

---------------

 instance, if it's an esterification, but that would add oxygens. Not sure. 

Wait, maybe the product is an alcohol. Let me think of

---------------

 the product of a keto acid with sodium hydride (the analog). Suppose the keto acid is acetoacetic acid. React

---------------

ing with NaH (the analog) might form a sodium salt, which when treated further could form a product with two oxygens. Not

---------------

 sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone, but that would have more oxygen. 

Hmm, maybe I'm over

---------------

complicating this. Let's think again of the elements in X. The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. Suppose

---------------

 X is sodium deuteride (NaD). The elements are sodium (Na) and deuterium (D, which is hydrogen-2). The lightest element is hydrogen (even

---------------

 if it's deuterium, it's still hydrogen, atomic number 1), and the heaviest is sodium (atomic number 11). The atomic mass of Na is about 23, and de

---------------

uterium is 2. So sum would be 23 + 2 = 25. That's option B. 



---------------

Wait, but the problem says "heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements". Sodium's common isotope is Na-23, which is already the light

---------------

est isotope (since isotopes are heavier than the base). Wait, but the question says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So

---------------

 if X is NaD, then the hydrogen is deuterium (a heavier isotope of H), so that fits. The other element is sodium, which doesn

---------------

't have a heavier isotope mentioned. So the elements are Na (23) and D (2). So the lightest is H (D

---------------

 is just an isotope of H), so the lightest is H (atomic mass 2 for D?), or do we consider the natural

---------------

 isotope? Wait, the question says "considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed." 

Wait, the problem says "

---------------

the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". So we need to consider all the elements in X, not

---------------

 isotopes. The elements in X are sodium and hydrogen. The lightest element is hydrogen (atomic mass of its isotope here

---------------

 is 2, since it's deuterium). The heaviest is sodium (23). So total would be 23 + 2 = 25, which is option B. 

Alternatively, maybe the question

---------------

 counts the hydrogen as just the element's standard atomic mass, but since they specified the heavier isotope is used, so the

---------------

 hydrogen here is deuterium (mass 2). So the lightest element's mass is 2 (H), heaviest is 23 (Na). Sum is 25. So answer

---------------

 B. 

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing another element. Wait, maybe the substance X is something else. Let me check another

---------------

 possibility. Suppose X is lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4), but the analog would be LiAlD4? Wait

---------------

, but the analog is "very close", so maybe LiAlH4 is the analog, and X is LiAlD4. But

---------------

 then the elements are Li (7), Al (27), H (or D). The lightest is H (mass 2),

---------------

 heaviest is Al (27). Sum would be 29 (2+27). That would be option D. 

Hmm, so

---------------

 that's another possibility. Let's see which fits better. 

If X is LiAlH4 (the analog), then the heavier

---------------

 isotope would be in one of its elements. For example, maybe it's lithium with a heavier isotope (like Li-7 is the common one; but

---------------

 Li-6 is lighter, Li-7 is the main). Alternatively, maybe aluminum's isotope? But the problem states "

---------------

heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements". So maybe the hydride part is deuterium. So LiAlD4 would have deuterium as

---------------

 the H. 

In that case, the elements are Li (3 protons, mass ~7), Al (13, mass ~27), and D (H

---------------

 with mass 2). The lightest element is H (mass 2), heaviest is Al (27). Sum is 29, option D. 

Now

---------------

, which scenario fits the other clues better? Let's check the reaction. 

If X is LiAlH4 (the analog)

---------------

 or LiAlD4 (X), reacting with liquid Y (maybe an acid like water?), the reaction would produce H2 or D2 gas (W

---------------

), and maybe a precipitate. The product with a keto acid would be... Well, LiAlH4 is a reducing agent. When

---------------

 reacted with a keto acid, it reduces the ketone group to an alcohol. The product would have the alcohol and the carboxylic acid. The

---------------

 carboxylic acid has two oxygen atoms (the COOH group), and the alcohol has one, totaling three. But the problem says the product has two oxygens. Hmm, that

---------------

 doesn't fit. 

But if the reaction goes further, maybe the carboxylic acid is also reduced. For example, ac

---------------

etoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH) reduced by LiAlH4 would give CH3CH2CH2COOH? No, maybe

---------------

 it becomes a diol? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reduction removes oxygen. Wait, maybe it's a different reaction

---------------

. 

Alternatively, if the product is an ester, but that would add oxygens. 

Hmm, so maybe the

---------------

 first scenario where X is NaD (sodium deuteride) fits better because the product with a keto acid would have two oxygens. Wait, if

---------------

 the reaction is deprotonation, forming a sodium salt, but that might not reduce the oxygen count. 

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 the product is an alcohol with one oxygen (the hydroxyl) and the carboxylic acid's two oxygens.

---------------

 But that's three. 

Wait, maybe the keto acid is something like a diketone with an ester group, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the product

---------------

 is the conjugate base of the keto acid. For example, acetoacetic acid (two oxygens in the CO

---------------

OH group) when treated with NaH would form the sodium salt, which still has two oxygens. Because the -COO^-Na+ would still have the two oxygens. So the

---------------

 product would have two oxygens. That fits! 

Ah, that's possible. If the keto acid reacts with sodium deuteride (X), it

---------------

 would deprotonate the carboxylic acid, forming the conjugate base (sodium salt). The product would still

---------------

 have the carboxylic acid group's oxygens (two), so the total is two. That works! 

Therefore, in

---------------

 this case, X is NaD (sodium deuteride). The elements in X are sodium (Na) and hydrogen (as deuterium). The lightest element is hydrogen (mass 2), the heaviest is sodium (23). Sum is 2 + 23 = 25, which is option B. 

Alternatively

---------------

, if the substance is LiAlD4, the elements are Li (mass ~7), Al (27), and D (2). Lightest is H (2), heaviest is Al (27). Sum is 29 (D). But the

---------------

 reaction with a keto acid leading to two oxygens doesn't fit as well. 

So between the two possibilities, NaD seems

---------------

 better. 

Another check: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. If X is NaD reacting with water, producing

---------------

 NaOH (soluble), so maybe Y is another solution. Wait, perhaps the liquid Y is a solution containing a metal salt, so that when NaOH is formed, it reacts to form a precipitate. Like,

---------------

 if Y is a solution of FeCl3, adding NaOH would produce Fe(OH)3 precipitate. Heating Fe(OH)3 would decom

---------------

pose to Fe2O3 and H2O. The melting point of Fe2O3 is way too high. 



---------------

Hmm, but the question says the melting point of B is near 277 K. If B is H2O (mel

---------------

ting point 273 K), but that's a liquid. Alternatively, maybe B is the gas W? If W is D2, then

---------------

 it's a gas, so melting point would be for solid deuterium, which is about 18.7 K,

---------------

 way too low. 

Alternatively, maybe B is the precipitate G itself when heated. For instance, if G is something

---------------

 like calcium carbonate, which when heated becomes CaO (melting point too high). 

Wait, perhaps the precipitate is something

---------------

 like ammonium carbonate, which on heating releases NH3 and CO2, so B would be either of those. But their melting points are too

---------------

 low. 

Alternatively, maybe the precipitate is a hydrate, like copper sulfate pentahydrate, which when heated releases water (B is

---------------

 water, but again melting point 273 K). 

Hmm, maybe the question's mention of B's melting point is a clue to

---------------

 identify B as a specific substance. The closest I can think of is that the melting point near 277 K (4°C) is very

---------------

 close to the melting point of gallium (29.76°C). But that's higher. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo

---------------

 and the melting point is 297 K (24°C), which is closer to gallium. But assuming the question is correct, perhaps the

---------------

 B is an error, but maybe I should proceed with the earlier reasoning. 

Since the problem states that the product of the keto acid reaction with X has two oxygens, which fits with the sodium deuteride scenario (the

---------------

 product is the sodium salt with two oxygens), I think that's the right path. Therefore, the answer is 2 + 23 = 25 (Option B).


The problem involves identifying Substance X and calculating the sum of the atomic masses of its lightest and heaviest elements. Key clues include:



---------------

1. **Gas W**: Its molecules have equal protons and neutrons per atom. Deuterium gas (D₂) fits,

---------------

 as each deuterium atom (¹H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.
2. **Substance X's Analog**: Likely

---------------

 sodium hydride (NaH), with X being sodium deuteride (NaD), incorporating the heavier isotope (deuterium).
3. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The

---------------

 product contains 2 oxygen atoms. This aligns with sodium deuteride deprotonating the keto acid's carboxylic group, forming a sodium salt retaining two oxygen atoms.
4. **Precipitate G and B**: While

---------------

 the exact identity of G and B is less critical for the atomic mass calculation, the melting point of B (~277 K) suggests

---------------

 a substance near freezing point, possibly water (melting at 273 K), though exact details are less critical here.

**Elements in X (NaD):** Sodium (Na) and hydrogen (D, an isotope of H).  
- Lightest element: Hydrogen (D

---------------

 has an atomic mass of 2).  
- Heaviest element: Sodium (atomic mass ~23).  
- **Sum**: 2 + 23 = **25**.

Answer: B) 25.

Answer: B) 25.



---------------

Answer: $B$.

Wait, the final answer should be in the format 'Answer: $LETTER'. Based on the reasoning

---------------

, the correct answer is B (25), so:

Answer: B

Wait, the problem says "cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". The

---------------

 elements are H and Na. The lightest is H (mass 2 for deuterium?), but wait, the question

---------------

 specifies "atomic masses" of the elements, not accounting for isotopes. Wait, the question says "considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed." Wait

---------------

, perhaps I misunderstood. The elements in X are H (with deuterium) and Na. The lightest element is H, and

---------------

 the heaviest is Na. The atomic mass of H here is the deuterium isotope (mass 2), and

---------------

 Na's atomic mass is ~23. So 2+23=25. So the correct answer is B. 



---------------

The correct answer is B. So the final line should be:

Answer: B

But in the instructions, it says to put the

---------------

 answer exactly as 'Answer: $LETTER'. So:

Answer: B

But the options are labeled A-D. The

---------------

 options are:

A) 35

B) 25

C) 31

D) 29

So the

---------------

 correct answer is B. Thus:

Answer: B

But in the problem's options, B is 25. So

---------------

 yes.
