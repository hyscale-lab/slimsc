Okay, so I need to figure out at what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes limited by annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The question gives the average CMB photon energy as 10^-3 eV. Hmm, right, this is

---------------

 about the pair production process where a high-energy gamma photon collides with a lower-energy photon (from the CMB here) and creates an electron-positron pair. 

First, I remember that for pair production to occur, the total energy of the two photons must be at least the rest mass energy of the electron and positron. Since each has a rest mass of about 0.511 MeV, the total required

---------------

 is 2*0.511 MeV, which is 1.022 MeV. But wait, this

---------------

 is in the center-of-mass frame, right? Because in pair production, the two photons have to have enough combined energy to create the pair

---------------

. 

So the process is γ (high energy) + γ (CMB) → e+ + e-. The threshold condition would

---------------

 be when their combined energy equals the rest mass energy of the two electrons. But since the photons are moving, their energies add

---------------

 up in the appropriate frame. Wait, actually, in pair production via two photons, the threshold condition requires that the sum of their energies in the center-of-mass frame is at least the rest mass energy. But how

---------------

 do I relate that to the lab frame here?

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the threshold condition in terms of the energy

---------------

 of the gamma-ray. Let me recall the formula for the minimum energy required for pair production with a photon of energy ε (the CMB photon here). 

I think the formula for the minimum energy of the high

---------------

-energy photon (Eγ) needed to produce an electron-positron pair when colliding with a photon of energy ε is given by the threshold condition.

---------------

 The threshold occurs when the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is exactly the rest mass energy of the two electrons. 

The formula

---------------

 I might need here is Eγ * ε ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / (4 ε), but maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, the

---------------

 minimum energy Eγ needed for pair production with a photon of energy ε (in the same frame) is given by Eγ ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / (4 ε). Wait, that

---------------

 sounds familiar. Let me check the derivation. 

The pair production requires that the sum of the energies of the two photons (

---------------

in the center of mass frame) must be at least 2m_e c². But since photons have no rest mass, their energy is entirely

---------------

 kinetic. To get the threshold condition, we can set the total energy in the center of mass to exactly 2m_e c². 

Alternatively, considering

---------------

 that in the lab frame, the CMB photon is at rest? Wait no, photons are always moving at c. Hmm, maybe it

---------------

's better to use relativistic equations here. 

The threshold condition for pair production via two photons is when their combined energy in

---------------

 the center of mass frame is at least the rest mass of the two electrons. The minimum energy occurs when the two photons are moving directly towards each other, so their momenta are opposite. The

---------------

 total energy in the center of mass frame would then be Eγ + ε (since they are moving in opposite directions, their momenta cancel

---------------

 in the center of mass frame). Wait, no, the center of mass frame's energy would be the sum of their energies in

---------------

 that frame. Wait, perhaps I need to compute the invariant quantity s = (p1 + p2)^2, which must be ≥ (2m_e c²)^2. 

The invariant s for two photons is given

---------------

 by s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. But for photons, E = pc, so p

---------------

1 c = E1 and p2 c = E2. Thus, s = (Eγ + ε)^2 - (Eγ + ε)^2 =

---------------

 0? Wait that can't be right. Wait no, wait, the vectors. Wait, the photons are moving in opposite directions? 



---------------

Wait, let me think again. The invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (p1 c

---------------

)^2 + (p2 c)^2 + 2 p1 p2 c^2 cosθ) )? Hmm

---------------

, maybe I need to consider their direction. Let me set up coordinates where one photon is moving along the positive z-axis and the other along the negative z-axis. Then their momenta are p

---------------

1 and -p2 (since direction matters). So the total momentum vector would be (p1 - p2) along the z-axis. 



---------------

The invariant s is (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2. 

E_total is Eγ + ε. 

p_total is (Eγ/c - ε/c), since one

---------------

 is in +z, the other in -z. So p_total c = Eγ - ε. 

Thus, s = (Eγ + ε)^2 - (Eγ - ε)^2. Let me compute that. 

Expanding (

---------------

a + b)^2 - (a - b)^2 = 4ab. So s = 4 Eγ ε. 

The

---------------

 threshold condition requires that s ≥ (2 m_e c²)^2. 

Therefore, 4 Eγ ε ≥ (2 m_e c²)^2. 

Dividing both sides by 4: Eγ ε ≥ (m_e c²)^2. 

Therefore

---------------

, solving for Eγ gives Eγ ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / ε. 

Ah, that's the formula! So the minimum energy required for the high-energy photon is (m_e c²)^2 divided by the energy of the other photon (the CMB photon here). 

So

---------------

 plugging in the numbers. 

The rest mass energy of the electron is m_e c² = 0.511 MeV. 



---------------

The CMB photon energy ε is 1e-3 eV. 

Wait, but units here: I need to make sure they

---------------

 are in the same units. Let me convert everything to eV. 

0.511 MeV is 0.511 * 1e6 eV = 5.11e5 eV. 

So (m_e c²)^2 is (5.11e5 eV)^2. 

Divided by ε =

---------------

 1e-3 eV. 

So Eγ ≥ (5.11e5)^2 / (1e-3) eV. 

Let me compute that. 

First, square 5.11e5: (5.11)^2 = approx 26.11, so (5.11e5)^2 = 26.11e10 (since (5.11)^2 ×

---------------

 (1e5)^2 = 26.11 × 1e10). 

Wait, 5.11 squared is actually

---------------

 5.11*5.11. Let me calculate that more accurately. 5*5 is 25, 0.11*5 is

---------------

 0.55, so 5.11 squared is (5 + 0.11)^2 = 25 + 2*5*0.11 + 0.11² = 25 + 1.1 + 0.0121 = 26.1121. So yeah

---------------

, approximately 26.11. 

So (5.11e5 eV)^2 = 26.11e10 eV². 

Divide that by ε = 1e-3 eV.

---------------

 

So 26.11e10 / 1e-3 = 26.11e13 eV. 

So

---------------

 Eγ ≥ 26.11e13 eV. 

Now, converting eV to GeV. 

1 GeV = 1e9 eV. 

So 26.11e13 eV = 26.11e13 / 1e9 = 26.11e4 GeV. 

Hmm

---------------

, so approximately 2.611e5 GeV. 

Looking at the options: 

A) 9.5e4 GeV 

B) 1.8e5 

C) 2.6e5 

D) 3.9e5 

So option

---------------

 C is 2.6e5 GeV, which is close to our calculation (26.11e4 is 2.611e5). 

Wait, but

---------------

 wait, let me check the calculation again. 

Wait, (0.511 MeV)^2/(1e-3 eV). Wait, hold

---------------

 on. 

Wait, the formula is (m_e c²)^2 / ε. 

Wait, m_e c² is 0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV. 

So (511,000 eV)^2 divided by (1e-3 eV) 



---------------

So numerator is (5.11e5)^2 = (5.11)^2 * 1e10 =

---------------

 26.1121e10 eV² 

Denominator is 1e-3 eV. 

So dividing

---------------

 gives (26.1121e10) / (1e-3) = 26.1121e13 eV 

Convert

---------------

 to GeV: 26.1121e13 eV / 1e9 eV/GeV = 26.1121e4 GeV =

---------------

 2.61121e5 GeV. 

So yes, that's exactly option C. 

Therefore

---------------

, the answer should be C. 

Wait, but the options have numbers like 2.6*1e5.

---------------

 The way it's written might be a typo? Let me check the options again. 

The options are written as:

A) 9.5*1e4 GeV → 95,000 GeV



---------------

B) 1.8*1e5 → 180,000

C) 2.6*1e5 → 260,000

D) 3.9*1e5 → 390,000

Yes, so 2.6e5 matches exactly

---------------

 with our calculation. So the correct answer is C.


To determine the minimum energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes are limited by annihilation with CMB photons, we use the threshold condition for pair production: $\

---------------

gamma \gamma \rightarrow e^+ e^-$. The invariant energy squared, $s$, must be at least $(2m_e c^2)^2$. For two photons with energies $E_\gamma$ (high-energy gamma) and $\epsilon$ (CMB photon), the invariant is $s = 4 E_\gamma \epsilon$. Setting $s = (2m_e c^2)^2$ gives the threshold condition:

\[
4 E_\gamma \epsilon \geq (2 m_e c^2)^2 \implies E_\gamma \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{\epsilon}.
\]

Plugging in values: $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 5.11 \times 10^5 \, \text{eV}$ and $\epsilon = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$,

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{(5.11 \times 10^5 \, \text{eV})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = \frac{(26.11 \times 10^{10} \, \text{eV}^2)}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = 26.11 \times 10^{13} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Converting to GeV ($1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}$):

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{26.11 \times 10^{13} \, \text{eV}}{10^9 \, \text{eV/GeV}} = 2.611 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

This matches option C.
