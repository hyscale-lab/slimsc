Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The key points here are the conservation laws involving

---------------

 angular momentum, parity, and the Pauli statistics condition given. The final NN state has T(NN)=0, and we need to find which of the options is not permitted. Let's break it down.

First, let me recall some basics. The initial state is 1S0. The term symbol notation is (2S+1)L_J, so here S (total spin of the NN system) is 0 because the subscript is 0. The L here is S, which corresponds to L=0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0. The total angular momentum J is then L + S = 0, which matches the subscript 0. 

The particle X is emitted, so the final state is the NN system plus X. The problem states that the final NN state must satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Since T(NN) is given as 0, this equation becomes 0 ≡ S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Rearranging, that means S(NN) + L(NN) must be congruent to 1 mod 2. So S + L must be odd for the final NN state. 

Now, considering

---------------

 conservation laws. Angular momentum must be conserved. The total angular momentum before (initial NN) plus the angular momentum of the emitted particle X must equal the total angular momentum after (final NN plus X's angular momentum). Wait, actually, maybe

---------------

 I need to think about the total angular momentum conservation between the initial state and the final state (NN + X). Since the initial is NN, the final is NN plus X. So the total angular momentum of the initial system (which is just the NN in

---------------

 1S0) must equal the total angular momentum of the final system (NN + X). But since the initial system

---------------

 has J=0 (from 1S0), the final total angular momentum must also be zero? Or perhaps I need to consider the angular

---------------

 momentum of the emitted particle and how it combines with the final NN's angular momentum. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of partial waves.

The options

---------------

 are given as transitions like 1S0 -> something + p (proton?), but the lowercase letter (like s, p, d, f) probably

---------------

 refers to the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X relative to the NN system. Wait, the question says "the angular momentum state of X". So,

---------------

 in nuclear physics, when a particle is emitted, its orbital angular momentum is denoted by l, and the partial wave is labeled by the letter (s for l=0, p for l=1, d=2, f=3 etc). So the lowercase letter here refers

---------------

 to the l of X. 

So for each option, the final NN state's angular momentum (L_NN) and spin (S_NN) must satisfy T(NN)=0, and the Pauli condition S

---------------

_NN + L_NN must be odd. Also, parity must be conserved. The initial parity of the NN system is

---------------

 determined by its state. Since the initial state is 1S0, the parity is (-1)^L, where L here is the orbital angular momentum of the NN in the initial state, which is 0 (since it's S state). So initial parity is (-1)^0 = +1. 

The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. The total parity must be conserved. The total parity before (initial NN) is +1. The total parity after must also be +1. The final parity is the product of the parity of the NN system and the parity of the emitted particle. The parity of the NN final state is determined by their orbital angular momentum L_NN: (-1)^{L_NN}. The parity of the emitted particle X is its intrinsic parity multiplied by (-1)^l (since its orbital angular momentum is l). Wait, the

---------------

 particle's parity is intrinsic parity times (-1)^l. Because the parity of the emitted particle in its state is intrinsic parity times the orbital angular momentum's contribution. 

So total parity after emission

---------------

 is [parity(NN_final)] * [parity(X)] = [(-1)^{L_NN}] * [(-1)^l * intrinsic_parity(X)]. Since intrinsic_parity(X) is -1, which is (-1)^1. So substit

---------------

uting, that becomes (-1)^{L_NN} * (-1)^l * (-1)^1. The total must equal the initial parity of +1. 

Putting it all together: 

Initial parity = +1 = Final parity:

---------------

 

(-1)^{L_NN} * (-1)^l * (-1)^1 = (-1)^{L_NN + l +1} must equal +1. 

Therefore, L_NN + l +1 must be even, so L_NN + l must be odd. 

So that's the parity condition: L_NN + l must be odd. 

Now, let

---------------

's also consider angular momentum conservation. The total angular momentum of the initial state (J_initial = 0) must equal the total angular momentum of the final system. The final system's total angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN's angular momentum (J_NN) and the emitted particle's angular momentum (j_X). The

---------------

 particle X's angular momentum is j_X = l + s_X, where s_X is its spin. However, since the problem doesn't specify the spin of X, perhaps we can assume that the spin

---------------

 of X is accounted for in the term symbols of the NN? Wait, the term symbols for the NN final states are given. Let's see the options again. 

Each option is like

---------------

 1S0 -> [term symbol for NN] + [partial wave letter]. The NN's term symbol would be (2S_NN+1)L_NN_J_NN. For example, option B is 3S1 + p. The NN's term is 3S1, so 2S+1=3 implies S_NN=1, L_NN=0 (since S is the symbol), and J_NN = 1. 

The total angular momentum of the final state is J_NN (from NN) plus the angular momentum of X, which is l (orbital) plus its spin. But since

---------------

 the question might be simplifying, perhaps they are considering that the total angular momentum of X is just its orbital angular momentum (l) plus its spin (but the

---------------

 spin of X isn't given). Hmm, this might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the total angular momentum of the emitted particle X is its orbital angular momentum l plus its spin, but since we don't know the spin of X, perhaps the angular

---------------

 momentum conservation is only considered in terms of the partial waves? 

Alternatively, maybe the question expects that the angular momentum of the emitted

---------------

 particle is just its orbital angular momentum l. Wait, but the term symbol for the NN includes their own angular momentum. So

---------------

 the total angular momentum before (J_initial =0) must equal the vector sum of the NN's J_NN and the particle's angular momentum (which is l plus its spin). Since the problem doesn't specify X's spin, perhaps we can assume that the emitted particle has spin 0? Because if

---------------

 X is a pion, for instance, its spin is 0, but maybe here they are considering a proton? Wait, the options include p

---------------

, s, etc. The emitted particle is labeled as "p" in option A, which might stand for proton. But pro

---------------

tons have spin 1/2, so that complicates things. Hmm, this is a problem. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering

---------------

 that the total angular momentum conservation is only in terms of the orbital angular momentum of X and the NN's orbital and spin. Wait

---------------

, maybe the problem is more about the parity and the Pauli condition rather than detailed angular momentum addition. Let me see. 

Let me approach

---------------

 each option step by step. Let's note down for each option:

First, let's note that the final NN state must have T(NN)=0, and the

---------------

 Pauli condition T(NN) = S_NN + L_NN +1 mod 2. Since T(NN)=0, then

---------------

 S_NN + L_NN must be odd. 

Also, the parity condition requires L_NN + l (the l of X) must be odd. 

Additionally, the angular momentum conservation: The initial J is 0, so the final total J (NN's J plus X's angular momentum) must also be 0. But since

---------------

 we don't know X's spin, maybe this is a red herring? Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the orbital

---------------

 angular momentum of X (l) plus the NN's J must combine to 0. But that might not make sense unless l

---------------

 is equal and opposite to the NN's J. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only concerned with the parity and Pauli condition, and the angular momentum conservation is implicitly

---------------

 handled through the partial wave notation? 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting us to use that the total angular momentum of the emitted particle (which

---------------

 includes its spin and orbital angular momentum) must combine with the NN's angular momentum to give the initial J=0. Since we don't have the

---------------

 spin of X, maybe the question is only considering the orbital angular momentum part. But this is getting a bit too vague. Let's try to proceed with the given information. 

Let me look

---------------

 at each option one by one. 

Option A: 1S0 -> 7D1 + p. 

First, the final NN state is 7D1. The term symbol is

---------------

 (2S+1)L_J. Here, 7 implies 2S+1=7, so S_NN=3 (since 2*3+1=7). The L here is D which is l=2, so L_NN=2. The J is 1. 

Check the Pauli condition: T(NN)=0 = S_NN + L_NN +1 mod 2? Wait, the equation

---------------

 given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Since T(NN)=0, then 0 ≡ (3 + 2 +1) mod 2? 3+2=5, 5+1=6 mod2 is 0. Wait 3+2 is 5, so

---------------

 S + L =5, which mod2 is 1. Then 1 +1 mod2? Wait no, the equation is T = S + L +1 mod2. So substituting S=3, L=2: 3+2 +1 =6 mod2 is 0. So 0 mod2 equals

---------------

 T(NN)=0, so that works. So Pauli condition is okay here. 

Now parity condition: L_NN (2) + l (the l from the emitted particle's partial wave). The lowercase

---------------

 letter here is p, which is l=1. So L_NN + l = 2 +1=3, which is odd. So parity condition is satisfied. 

So A is allowed. 

Option B: 1S0 -> 3S1 + p 

The final NN term is 3S1. So 2S+1=3 → S=1. L is S, so L_NN=0. J=1. 

Pauli condition: T(NN)=0.

---------------

 Check S + L +1 mod2. S=1, L=0 → 1+0=1. 1 +1 mod2 is

---------------

 0. Which matches T=0. So that's okay. 

Parity: L_NN (0) + l (p is l=1) → 0+1=1 (odd). So parity is okay. 

So B is allowed. 

Option C: 1S0 -> 3D3 + f 

The final NN term is 3D3. 

2

---------------

S+1=3 → S=1. L is D → L_NN=2. J=3 (since the subscript is 3). 

Pauli condition: S + L must be odd. 1+2=3, which is odd. So 3 mod2 is 1. So S

---------------

 + L is odd, so T=0 is okay (since T = (S+L +1) mod2? Wait wait

---------------

, the given equation is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. Wait no, the question says "T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)". So substit

---------------

uting S=1, L=2 → 1+2 +1 =4 mod2=0. Which matches T(NN)=0. So that's okay. 

Parity: L_NN is 2 (D), and the emitted particle's l is f which is l=3. So L_NN + l = 2 +3 =5, which is odd. So parity okay. 

Now

---------------

 check angular momentum? The initial J is 0. The final NN has J=3, and the emitted particle's angular momentum is l=3 (since f is l=3) plus its spin. Wait

---------------

, but we don't know the spin of X. Hmm, but maybe the question allows any possible combination where J_NN and l can combine to give total J=0? Not

---------------

 sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't require that, because the question says "partial waves is not permitted" based on the given conditions (Pauli and parity). Since both parity and Pauli are satisfied here, then

---------------

 maybe this is allowed. 

Wait the question is which is NOT permitted, so maybe this is okay. 

Option D: 1S0 -> 3P0 + s 

The final NN state is 3P0. 

Term symbol: 3 means S=1 (since 2*1+1=3). L is P, so L_NN=1. J=0. 

Pauli condition: S + L = 1 +1 =2 → even. Then T = (S + L +1) mod2 → (2 +1)=3 mod2 =1. But T(NN) is supposed to be 0. Wait, that's a problem. 

Wait let

---------------

's compute T(NN)= S + L +1 mod2. 

Here, S=1, L=1. 

So S + L = 2, so

---------------

 2 +1 (from the formula?) Wait wait, the equation given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod2. Wait, no

---------------

, the equation is T(NN) equals (S + L +1) mod2? 

Yes, exactly. So substit

---------------

uting S=1, L=1: 1+1+1 =3 mod2=1. But the problem states that the final NN has T(NN)=0. So this would violate the condition. Therefore, this option is not allowed. 

Wait, so D is the answer? Let me check the parity here

---------------

 too. 

Parity condition: L_NN (1) + l (since the particle's partial wave is s, which is l=0). So 1+0=1 (odd). Parity is okay. 

So the parity is okay, but the Pauli condition (the T(NN)=0 requirement) is not met here. Because

---------------

 T would be 1 mod2. So D is invalid. 

Wait, so option D is the one that's not permitted. 

Wait, but let me check again the other options.

---------------

 

Wait, let's confirm all steps again. 

Starting with option D: 

Final NN state 3P0: 

Term symbol 3P0: 

2S+1=3 → S=1. 

L is P → L=1. 

Then

---------------

 T(NN)= S + L +1 mod2 → 1+1 +1 =3 mod2=1. But the problem says T(NN)=0, so that's a contradiction. So this transition is forbidden, so D is the answer. 

Wait

---------------

 but let me check the other options again. 

Looking back at option C: 

Final NN is 3D3. 

S=1, L=2. 

T = 1+2 +1 mod2 → 4 mod2=0. So that's okay. 

Parity: L_NN (2) + l (f is 3) → 2+3=5,

---------------

 odd. Okay. 

So C is allowed. 

Therefore, the answer should be D. 

Wait but wait the question says "the final NN state has T(NN)=0". So for

---------------

 option D, since T(NN) would be 1 mod2, that's not allowed. So that's the one that's not permitted. 

Therefore

---------------

, the answer is D. 

Wait the options are labeled A to D, so D is option D. 

Wait but let me check the

---------------

 other options again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. 

Option B: 3S1. S=1, L=0. T is 1+0 +1 mod2 → 2 mod2=0. Correct. 

Option A: 7D1. S=3, L=2. 3+2 +1=6 mod2=0. Correct. 

Option C: 3D3. S=1, L=2 → 1+2+1=4 mod2=0. Correct. 

Only D has T=1, which violates the given condition. 

Therefore, the answer is D. 

Wait the options are:

---------------

 

D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s 

Yes, so the answer is D. 

Wait but wait, the

---------------

 question says "the partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X". So the partial

---------------

 wave here refers to the l of X. 

Wait, but in option D, the emitted particle's l is s (l=0). 

So

---------------

, in terms of angular momentum conservation, the total angular momentum of the initial state (0) must equal the vector sum of the NN's J (0 in this case, since the NN is in 3P0 with J=0) and the emitted particle's angular momentum (l=0 plus its spin). But since the NN's J is 0 and the particle's l is 0, then

---------------

 the total angular momentum would be 0 plus whatever the spin of X is. But since the spin of X isn't given, perhaps that's acceptable

---------------

. Since the problem doesn't mention spin, maybe we don't need to consider that. 

Alternatively, maybe the question's

---------------

 angular momentum condition is that the orbital angular momentum of X (l) plus the NN's orbital angular momentum (L_NN) must combine

---------------

 with their spins to give the initial J. But without knowing the spin of X, perhaps it's not possible. 

However, since the question says

---------------

 "make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity", but the parity condition is satisfied in D, but the Pauli condition fails. So the answer

---------------

 is D. 

Yes, I think that's correct.


To solve this problem, we analyze the given conditions step by step. The initial NN system is in a 1S0 state, implying S_initial = 0, L_initial = 0, and J_initial = 0. The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. The final NN state must satisfy T(NN) = 0, which requires S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 ≡ 0 mod 2. Additionally, parity conservation and angular momentum conservation must hold.

**Parity Conservation**:
The initial parity is (+1)^{L_initial} = (+1)^0 = +1. The final parity must also be +1. The parity of the final system is given by:
\[
(-1)^{L_{NN}} \times [(-1)^l \times \text{intrinsic parity of } X] = (-1)^{L_{NN} + l + 1}.
\]
This must equal +1, so \( L_{NN} + l + 1 \) must be even → \( L_{NN} + l \) must be odd.

**Pauli Statistics Condition**:
For T(NN) = 0:
\[
S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 2 \implies S(NN) + L(NN) \equiv 1 \mod 2.
\]

**Analysis of Options**:

- **Option A (1S0 → 7D1 + p)**:
  - Final NN: 7D1 → \( 2S+1 = 7 \implies S = 3 \), \( L_{NN} = 2 \).
  - Pauli: \( 3 + 2 = 5 \equiv 1 \mod 2 \) ✔️.
  - Parity: \( L_{NN} = 2 \), \( l = 1 \) (p)

---------------

 → \( 2 + 1 = 3 \equiv 1 \mod 2 \) ✔️.
  - **Allowed**.

- **Option B (1S0 → 3S1 + p)**:
  - Final NN: 3S1 → \( S = 1 \), \( L_{NN} = 0 \).
  - Pauli: \( 1 + 0 = 1 \equiv 1 \mod 2 \) ✔️.
  - Parity: \( 0 + 1 = 1 \equiv 1 \mod 2 \) ✔️.
  - **Allowed**.

- **Option C (1S0 → 3D3 + f)**:
  - Final NN: 3D3 → \( S = 1 \), \( L_{NN} = 2 \).
  - Pauli: \( 1 + 2 = 3 \equiv 1 \mod 2 \) ✔️.
  - Parity: \( 2 + 3 = 5 \equiv 1 \mod 2 \) ✔️.
  - **Allowed**.

- **Option D (1S0 → 3P0 + s)**:
  - Final NN: 3P0 → \( S = 1 \), \( L_{NN} = 1 \).
  - Pauli: \( 1 + 1 = 2 \equiv 0 \mod 2 \) ❌ (fails T(NN) = 0 condition).
  - Parity: \( 1 + 0 = 1 \equiv 1 \mod 2 \) ✔️, but Pauli condition is violated.
  - **Not permitted**.

The only option violating the Pauli condition is **D**.

Answer: D<|im_end|>
