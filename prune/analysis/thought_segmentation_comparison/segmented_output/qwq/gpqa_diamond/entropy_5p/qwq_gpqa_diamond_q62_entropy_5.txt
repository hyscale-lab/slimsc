Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the question is about a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. They want to know the momentum of a photon needed for the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state when in its fundamental state. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I need to recall what the fundamental state means here. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which for a quantum system would be the ground state. But

---------------

 when they mention switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy, I think this is about a transition between energy levels. Since it's a rotation-vibration model, the molecule has both rotational and vibrational energy levels. The question is probably asking about a transition that involves the lowest possible energy change. 



---------------

Hmm, the problem states the molecule is in the fundamental state. The fundamental state for a quantum harmonic oscillator (vibrational) is the n=0 state. But for

---------------

 rotation, the ground state is also the lowest rotational level, which is l=0 (since rotational quantum number l starts at 0). So

---------------

 the fundamental state here is likely the lowest vibrational and rotational state, so n=0 and l=0?

Wait, but the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy". So when

---------------

 the photon is absorbed, the molecule goes to the next state with the least energy. So maybe the transition is the lowest possible energy transition from the fundamental state. 



---------------

But which transition would that be? Since both vibrational and rotational transitions are possible. The question might be referring to a rotational transition because the problem

---------------

 mentions the rotation-vibration model, but sometimes in these models, the vibrational transitions are usually much higher in energy than rotational transitions. But

---------------

 I need to check.

Alternatively, maybe they are considering the vibrational state first. The fundamental state (ground state) is n=0. To go to the next state (n=1), that would be a vibrational transition. The energy difference for vibrational states is ΔE_vib = ħω (since for harmonic oscillator, ΔE between n and n+1 is ħω). But

---------------

 if the question is about rotational transitions, then the energy levels for rotation are (l(l+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. So the lowest transition would be from l=0 to l=1, since

---------------

 that's the first allowed rotational transition (since Δl must be ±1? Wait, rotational transitions usually have Δl = ±1, so the lowest possible

---------------

 rotational transition from l=0 would be to l=1. 

But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So between a vibrational transition and a rotational transition, which has lower energy? Vibr

---------------

ational frequencies are typically higher (like in the IR region) whereas rotational transitions are in the microwave region, so the energy is lower for rotational. So maybe the photon's

---------------

 energy corresponds to a rotational transition from l=0 to l=1? But the problem mentions "the next state with the lowest possible energy", so the transition

---------------

 to the next possible state which has the least energy. So if the fundamental state is the lowest energy (n=0, l=0), then the next possible state with the least energy would be the first excited state. Since

---------------

 rotational transitions require less energy than vibrational, the transition would be rotational. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the rotation

---------------

-vibration coupling, but in the rigid rotor approximation, the vibrational and rotational energies are separate. Wait, the problem says "quantum rotation-vibration model (or non-rigid rotor model)". Hmm, the

---------------

 non-rigid rotor model accounts for the vibrational motion, so the moment of inertia might vary with vibrational state? But I'm not sure if that affects the calculation here. 

Wait, the problem says

---------------

 "the next state with the lowest possible energy". The fundamental state is the lowest energy. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the first excited state, which would be the lowest energy excited state. So

---------------

 if the ground state is n=0 (vibrational) and l=0 (rotational), then the first excited state could be either n=1 (vibrational) or l=1 (rotational). Since

---------------

 rotational transitions have lower energy, the transition to l=1 would be the lower energy one. Therefore, the photon's energy would correspond to the rotational energy difference between l=0 and l=1. 

Wait, but I

---------------

 should check the problem again. The question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy". So the next state must be the immediate next one

---------------

. Wait, maybe the question is phrased such that the "next state with the lowest possible energy" is the first excited state. So that

---------------

 would be the lowest energy transition. 

Therefore, if that's a rotational transition, then the energy difference is ΔE_rot = E_rot(1) - E_rot(0). The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) l(l+1). So the difference between l=1 and l=0 is (ħ²/(2I))(1(2) - 0) = (ħ²/(2I))(2) = ħ²/I. 

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 I need to consider that when you go from l=0 to l=1, the energy difference is E_rot(1) - E_rot(0) = (ħ²/(2I))(1*(1+1) - 0) = (ħ²/(2I))*(2) = ħ²/I. 

So the energy of the photon must equal that. Since

---------------

 the photon's energy is E_photon = pc, where p is momentum. Wait, but photon energy is usually E = hf = hc/λ, but also E = pc because

---------------

 photons have no rest mass, so their energy is all kinetic. Since E = pc, then p = E/c. 

Wait, but let

---------------

 me make sure. The energy of a photon is E = hν, and since for photons, E = pc, then p = hν / c. Alternatively, since c = λν, so E = hc/λ = pc, so yes, p = E/c. Therefore, if we can find the energy difference Δ

---------------

E_rot, then the momentum p is (ΔE_rot)/c. 

So first, calculate the rotational energy difference between l=1 and l=0. 

To do that, we need the moment of inertia I. The moment of inertia for a diatomic molecule is I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass, and R is the bond length. 

The reduced mass μ is given by (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). The masses are given as 20 amu and 2 amu. 

So μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. 

But we need to convert amu to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. 

So μ = (20/11) * 1.6605e-27 kg. Let me compute that. 

20 divided by 11 is approximately 1.818. 

1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ let's see, 1.8 *1.66 = ~2.988, so around

---------------

 2.988e-27 kg. 

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 

1.818 * 1.6605 = 

1.8 *1.6605 = 2.9889

0.018 * 1.6605 = 0.029889

Total is approx 2.9889 + 0.029889 ≈ 3.0188e-27 kg. 

Hmm, okay

---------------

. 

The bond length R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 m, so R = 2e-10 m. 

So the moment of inertia I = μ R² = (3.0188e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 

Calculating R squared: (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m². 

Multiply that by μ:

3.0188e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 12.075e-47 kg·m² �

---------------

� 1.2075e-46 kg·m². 

Now, the energy difference ΔE_rot = ħ² / I. 

ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, which is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. 

So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ (1.05457)^2 * 1e-68 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s²? Wait, no, actually

---------------

, the units of ħ²/(I) would be (J·s)^2/(kg·m²). Wait, let

---------------

 me think again. 

Wait, the energy E_rot is (ħ^2/(2I)) l(l+1). So the difference between l=1 and l=0 is (ħ²/(2I))(2) = ħ²/(I). 

Wait, yes

---------------

, so ΔE_rot is ħ² divided by I. 

Wait, let me confirm the formula again. The rotational energy levels are (ħ²/(2I)) l(l+1). 

So when

---------------

 l=0, energy is 0. 

When l=1, energy is (ħ²/(2I))*(1*2) = (ħ²/(2I))*2 = ħ²/I. 

Therefore, the energy difference between l=1 and l=0 is indeed ħ²/I. 

So Δ

---------------

E_rot = ħ² / I. 

Plugging in the numbers:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s

So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ (1.0545718)^2 * 1e-68 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J²·s²).

---------------

 Wait, but when divided by I (kg·m²), the units would be (J²·s²)/(kg·m²). Wait, this

---------------

 seems off. Maybe I made a mistake here. 

Wait, let's think in terms of units. ħ has units of J·s. So ħ squared is (J·s)^2. Divided by I (kg·m²). 

But

---------------

 energy has units of J. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck. 

Wait, the energy difference is (ħ²/(2I)) * [l(l+1) - l'(l'+1)]. Here, l=

---------------

1, l'=0, so 2 - 0 = 2. So the difference is (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/I. 

Yes, so the energy is indeed ħ² divided by I. 

But let me compute the numerical value. 

ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approximately (1.05457e-34)^2. Let me compute that:

1.05457e-34 squared:

First, 1.05457^2 ≈ 1.112 (since 1.05^2 is 1.1025, and 0.00457 more

---------------

). 

So 1.112 * 1e-68 (since (1e-34)^2 is 1e-68). So ħ² ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s²? Wait, but actually

---------------

, the units for ħ²/I would be (J·s)^2 / (kg·m²). Hmm, maybe I should just

---------------

 proceed with the numbers and see. 

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me recast the energy difference.

---------------

 

Wait, the rotational energy levels are E_l = (l(l+1) h²)/(8π²I). Because sometimes it's written in terms of h instead of ħ. Let

---------------

 me check that formula. 

Hmm, different sources might use different expressions. Let me think again. 

The angular momentum is L = ħ sqrt(l(l+1)), so the energy is (L²)/(2I) = (ħ² l(l+1))/(2I). 

Yes, that's correct. So the energy levels are E_l = (ħ²/(2I)) l(l+1). 

Therefore, the difference between l=1 and l=0 is (ħ²/(2I))*(1*2 - 0) = (ħ²/(2I))*2 = ħ²/I. 

So the energy difference is indeed ħ² / I. 

So let

---------------

's compute this. 

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s

ħ squared = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 (J²·s²). 

Then I is 1.2075e-46 kg·m². 

So ΔE_rot = (1.112e-68 J²·s²) / (1.2075e-46 kg·m²). 

Wait, units

---------------

 here: J is kg·m²/s². So J²·s² divided by kg·m² would be ( (kg²·m^4/s^4) * s² ) / (kg·m²) ) = kg·m²/s², which is J. So units are correct. 

Calculating the numerical value: 

1.112e-68 / 1.2075e-46 ≈ (1.112 / 1.2075) * 1e-22 ≈ approx

---------------

 0.92 * 1e-22 ≈ 9.2e-23 J. 

Wait, let me compute that division more precisely: 

1.112 divided by 1.2075. Let me see: 1.2075 * 0.92 = 1.2075*0.9 =1.08675 and 1.2075*0.02=0.02415 → total 1.1109. Oh, so 1.112 /1.2075 ≈ 0.92. 

So Δ

---------------

E_rot ≈ 0.92 * 1e-22 J = 9.2e-23 J. 

Hmm

---------------

, okay. 

Now, the photon's energy must equal this. Since E_photon = pc (since for photons, E = pc).

---------------

 Therefore, p = E/(c). 

The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s. 

So p = 9.2e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) 

Wait

---------------

, J is kg·m²/s², so dividing by m/s gives (kg·m²/s²) / (m/s) = kg·m/s. Which is correct for momentum. 

Calculating:

---------------

 

9.2e-23 / 3e8 = (9.2/3) * 1e-31 ≈ 3.066...e-31? Wait, 9.2 divided by 3 is about 3.066,

---------------

 so 3.066e-31? Wait, no, 1e-23 divided by 1e8 is 1e-31, so yes. 

Wait, let me rec

---------------

alculate:

9.2e-23 divided by 3e8 = (9.2/3) * (1e-23 / 1e8) = 3.066666... * 1e-31 = 3.06666e-31 kg·m/s. 

Wait, but the options are given in N·s. Since 1 N·s = 1 kg·m/s, so the units are the same. 

Looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28 N·s

B) 2.3e-27

C) 1.1e-27

D) 1.4e-28

Hmm, my calculation gave 

---------------

3.07e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3.07e-31 N·s. That's way smaller than any of the options. Wait

---------------

, that can't be right. I must have messed up a calculation step. 

Wait, this discrepancy is huge. Let me check where I went wrong. 

Let me retrace the steps. 

First, the reduced mass μ:



---------------

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. 

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg. 

So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg. Let me compute that again:

1.818 * 1.6605.

---------------

 

1.8 *1.6605 = 2.9889

0.018 *1.6605 = 0.029889 

Total is 2.9889 + 0.029889 ≈ 3.0188e-27 kg. 

Wait, that

---------------

's correct. 

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m. 

So I = μ * R² = 3.0188e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2. 

(2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m². 

So I = 3.0188e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2075e-46 kg·m². Correct. 

Then ΔE_rot = ħ² / I. 

ħ is 1.05457e-34 J·s. 

So ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx (1.05457)^2 * 1e-68. Let me compute that more

---------------

 accurately. 

1.05457 squared is: 

1.05^2 = 1.1025 

0.00457^2 = ~0.0000209 

Cross terms: 2 *1.05 *0.00457 ≈ 0.009597 

Total: 1.1025 + 0.009597 + 0.0000209 ≈ ~1.1121. 

So (1.05457)^2 ≈1.112. 

So ħ squared is 1.112e-68 J²·s². 

Then,

---------------

 dividing by I (1.2075e-46 kg·m²):

ΔE_rot = (1.112e-68)/(1.2075e-46) 

Let

---------------

 me compute that exponent: 1e-68 divided by 1e-46 is 1e-22. 

So 1.112 / 1.2075 ≈0.92, so 0.92e-22 J? Wait no, 

---------------

1.112e-68 divided by 1.2075e-46 = (1.112/1.2075) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.92 * 1e-22 = 9.2e-23 J. 

Wait

---------------

, so that's correct. 

Then E_photon = 9.2e-23 J, and p = E/c = 9.2e-23 / (3e8) 

Wait

---------------

, 9.2e-23 divided by 3e8 is (9.2/3) * 1e-31 ≈ 3.066e-31 kg·m/s. 

But the options are like

---------------

 1e-27 or 1e-28. So this is way off. 

Hmm, so I

---------------

 must have made a mistake. Let me think again. 

Wait, maybe I used the wrong energy difference. Perhaps it's a vibrational transition instead of rotational? 

Let me check that possibility. 

If the transition is vibrational, the energy difference between n=0 and n=1 would be ħω. 

The given angular frequency is ω = 4e14 rad/s. 

So ΔE_vib = ħω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = approx 4.218e-20 J. 

Then p = E/c = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 = approx 1.4e-28 N·s. 

Looking at the options, that's option D. 

Hmm, but why would the question

---------------

 mention the rotation-vibration model if it's just a vibrational transition? Wait, the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy". The vibrational transition would

---------------

 have a much higher energy than rotational. So the lowest energy transition would be rotational. But according to my calculation, the rotational momentum is way too small (3e-31) which isn't among the options. 

Hmm, so there

---------------

 must be an error in my calculation. Let me check the formula again. 

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula for rotational energy difference. Let me see

---------------

. 

The rotational energy levels are E_l = (ħ²/(2I)) l(l+1). 

The energy difference between l=1 and l=0 is E_1 - E_0 = (ħ²/(2I))(1*2 - 0) = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ² / I. That's correct. 

Hmm, so maybe

---------------

 the problem is in the calculation of the moment of inertia. 

Wait, the bond length is given as R = 2 angstroms. But

---------------

 in the moment of inertia formula, R is the bond length, which is the distance between the atoms. So the reduced mass is correct. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in calculating

---------------

 the reduced mass. Let me recalculate μ again. 

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. 

μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈1.818 amu. 

Yes, that's correct. 

Hmm, let

---------------

 me check the value of ħ. Maybe I used ħ instead of h somewhere? 

Wait, the energy is (ħ²/(2I)) l(l+1). So if

---------------

 I had used h instead of ħ, then the energy would be (h²/(8π² I)) l(l+1). Let me see.

---------------

 

Wait, another formula for rotational energy is E = (h²/(8π² I)) l(l+1). Let me confirm.

---------------

 

Yes, sometimes rotational energy is expressed with h instead of ħ. Let me check that. 

Since ħ = h/(2π), so substituting into the previous formula: 

E = ( (h/(2π))² )/(2I) ) * l(l+1) 

= ( h²/(4π²) ) / (2I) * l(l+1) 

= h²/(8π² I) * l(l+1). 

Ah, so that

---------------

's another way to write it. 

So depending on which formula you use, you need to be careful. 

So if

---------------

 I use E = (h²/(8π² I)) l(l+1), then the energy difference between l=1 and l=0 would be:

ΔE_rot = (h²/(8π² I))*(2 -0) = (h²/(8π² I)) *2 

= h²/(4π² I). 

Hmm, that's different from the previous result

---------------

. 

So now, let's recalculate using this formula. 

First, h is Planck's constant: 6.62607015e-34 J·s. 

So h squared is (6.626e-34)^2. 

Then, Δ

---------------

E_rot = ( (6.626e-34)^2 )/(4 * π² * I) 

Let me compute that. 

First compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 43.9e-68 (since 6.6^2 is ~43.56). 

Denominator: 4 * π² * I. 

π² is approx 9.8696. 

So denominator: 4 *9.8696 * 1.2075e-46 

First compute 4 *9.8696 ≈ 39.4784 

Multiply by 1.2075e-46: 39.4784 *1.2075 ≈ let's see, 39 *1.2 is 46.8, plus 0.4784*1.2075 ≈ ~0.578, so total ≈47.378e-46? Wait, no, wait

---------------

:

Wait, 39.4784 *1.2075 = ?

Let me compute 39.4784 *1 = 39.4784 

39.4784 *0.2 = 7.89568 

39.4784 *0.0075 = ~0.296 

Adding up: 39.4784 +7.89568 =47.37408 +0.296 ≈47.670 

So denominator is approx 47.670e-46 (

---------------

since 1.2075e-46 *39.4784 is 47.67e-46).

---------------

 

So denominator is 47.67e-46 kg·m². 

So ΔE_rot = (43.9e-68 J²·s²) / (47.67e-46 kg·m²). 

Wait, units

---------------

 again: J is kg·m²/s². So J²·s² divided by kg·m²:

(

---------------

 (kg²·m^4/s^4)*s² ) / (kg·m²) ) = kg·m²/s² = J. So units are okay. 

Calculating the numbers: 

43.9 /47.67 ≈0.921

---------------

 

So 0.921 * 1e-22 (since 1e-68 /1e-46 is 1e-22). 

So ΔE_rot ≈0.921e-22 J ≈9.21e-23 J. 

Wait, that's the same as before! Because when

---------------

 I used ħ² / I, I got the same result as when I use h²/(4π² I). 

Wait, let

---------------

 me see:

Because ħ = h/(2π), so ħ² = h²/(4π²). 

So substituting back into the first formula:

ΔE_rot (from first approach) is ħ² / I = (h²/(4π²))/I 

Which is exactly the same as the second approach's Δ

---------------

E_rot = h²/(4π² I). 

So both methods give the same result. So that's correct. 

Hmm, so the

---------------

 calculation is correct, but the resulting momentum is 3e-31, which is not in the options. 

Hmm

---------------

. That suggests that perhaps the question is actually referring to a vibrational transition, even though the energy is higher. 

Wait, the

---------------

 question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy". The ground state is the lowest energy. The next possible state would

---------------

 be the first excited state. Which has the lowest energy possible. So between vibrational and rotational, which has lower energy? 

The

---------------

 vibrational frequency is given as ω =4e14 rad/s. The rotational energy transition is what I calculated (

---------------

9.2e-23 J). 

The vibrational energy difference is ΔE_vib = ħω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 ≈4.218e-20 J. 

So that

---------------

's much larger than the rotational energy difference. 

So the rotational transition is the lower energy one, so the photon needed for that is p

---------------

 = ΔE_rot /c = 9.2e-23 /3e8 ≈ 3.06e-31 N·s, which is way smaller than the options given. 

Hmm, so

---------------

 that can't be. So where is the mistake here?

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the bond length? The problem says R is 2 angstroms. 

---------------

1 angstrom is 1e-10 m, so that's correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking

---------------

 for the momentum in the vibrational transition, even though that's a higher energy, but perhaps I misunderstood the question. Let me re-read it. 

Question: "what momentum should an absorbed photon have, in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy?" 

Ah! The "next state with the lowest possible energy" —

---------------

 perhaps "next" here is the next possible state, but the "lowest possible energy" refers to the energy of the photon? Wait

---------------

, no. The wording is a bit confusing. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the transition to the next state (i.e., the first excited state), which has the lowest possible energy. Since rotational transitions have lower energy, then the answer should be based on that. But then

---------------

 the calculation gives a momentum not in the options. 

Hmm. Let me check the options again. 

Options:

A) 1.9e-28 

B) 2.3e-27 

C) 1.1e-27 

D) 1.4e-28 

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass? Let me check the masses again. 

The problem states Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. 

So μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈1.818 amu. 

Yes, that's correct. 

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring

---------------

 to the vibrational transition, but they used the angular frequency given (4e14 rad/s). Let me see what the momentum would be in that case. 

ΔE_vib = ħω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = approx 4.218e-20 J. 

Then p = E/c = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 ≈1.406e-28 N·s. That's option D. 

Hmm, so that

---------------

's exactly option D. 

But why would the question mention the rotation-vibration model if it's just a vibrational transition? The

---------------

 question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy". The lowest possible energy transition is rotational, but the problem gives the vibrational frequency. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a

---------------

 trick, where when they say "the next state with the lowest possible energy", they mean the next vibrational state, but the lowest possible energy for the photon?

---------------

 Wait, but vibrational transitions have higher energy. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the transition to the next rotational state but the

---------------

 given parameters include vibrational frequency which is not needed? 

Alternatively, maybe I made an error in calculating the rotational energy. Let me try

---------------

 another approach. 

Wait, perhaps the question is expecting me to consider the vibrational transition because the problem mentions "fundamental state", which in some contexts refers to the vibrational ground state. So

---------------

 perhaps the question is about a vibrational transition from n=0 to n=1. 

If that's the case, then the energy difference is indeed ΔE_vib = ħω. Then the momentum would be p = ΔE_vib / c = (ħ ω)/c. 

Pl

---------------

ugging in numbers: 

ħ = 1.05457e-34 J·s 

ω =4e14 rad/s 

c =3e8 m/s 

So p = (1.05457e-34 *4e14) /3e8 

=

---------------

 (4.218e-20) /3e8 

=1.406e-28 N·s 

Which is option D. 

Given

---------------

 that this matches option D and the options include that, perhaps the question is referring to a vibrational transition. Maybe the rotation

---------------

 part is a red herring, or perhaps the question is in the context where only vibrational transitions are considered for the fundamental state. 

Alternatively, maybe the term

---------------

 "fundamental state" refers to the vibrational ground state, and the question wants the transition to the first excited vibrational state, ignoring rotation. 

The

---------------

 problem statement mentions the rotation-vibration model, but perhaps the question is about the vibrational part. Since the angular frequency of vibration is given, which is needed

---------------

 for the vibrational transition. The rotational parameters (masses and bond length) are given, but if the question is about the vibrational transition, they might not be needed. 

Alternatively, maybe I made

---------------

 a mistake in the rotational calculation. Let me see. 

Wait, the rotational energy difference was 9.2e-23 J, which gives p ~3e-31 N·s, which is not an option. The

---------------

 vibrational gives ~1.4e-28, which is option D. Since the given angular frequency is for vibration, and

---------------

 the problem mentions "fundamental state", which is vibrational ground state, maybe the intended answer is D. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made

---------------

 a mistake in the reduced mass calculation. Wait, let me check that again. 

Wait, the question says "diatomic molecule, with elements X and Y". The reduced mass is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). 

Wait

---------------

, but sometimes, the formula is written as μ = (M1*M2)/(M1 + M2). So that's correct. 

So

---------------

 μ = (20 *2)/(22) =40/22 ≈1.818 amu. 

Con

---------------

verting to kg: 1.818 *1.66e-27 kg/amu. 

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong value for amu? Let me confirm the exact value of 1 amu. 

1 atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. 

So 1.818 *1.6605e-27 = let

---------------

 me compute more precisely. 

1.818 *1.6605 = 

Let me compute 1.8 *1.6605 = 2.9889 

0.018 *1.6605 = 0.029889 

Total: 2.9889 +0.029889 = 3.0188 

So μ =3.0188e-27 kg. 

Yes

---------------

, that's correct. 

Hmm. Maybe the question is expecting the rotational transition but there was a mistake in the problem's given values? For

---------------

 example, if the bond length was 2 angstroms, but perhaps in the calculation I need to use a different unit? Wait, no. 

Alternatively, perhaps I confused

---------------

 the formula for momentum. Wait, photon momentum is p = h / λ. 

Alternatively, energy is E = hc/λ, so p = E/c = (hc/λ)/c = h/λ. 

Alternatively, using

---------------

 p = h / λ. 

But the energy of the photon is E = h f = hc/λ. 

Alternatively, if

---------------

 we have the energy difference ΔE, then p = ΔE /c. 

Yes, that's correct. 

Hmm. Given

---------------

 that the vibrational calculation gives an option D which is present, and the rotational gives an answer not in the options, I think the intended answer is D. 

Perhaps the question is referring

---------------

 to the vibrational transition. Maybe the mention of the rotation-vibration model is just part of the setup, but the question is about the vibrational transition. 

Alternatively, maybe the "next state with the lowest possible energy" is the first excited rotational state when in the vibrational ground state. But

---------------

 even then, the calculation gives too low a momentum. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for rotational energy difference. Let me think

---------------

 again. 

Wait, another way to write the rotational energy is E_l = B l(l+1), where B is the rotational constant. 

B = ħ²/(2I). 

So the energy difference between l=1 and l=0 is B*(2 -0) = 2B. 

Wait, no. Wait

---------------

, E_1 = B*(1)(2) = 2B, and E_0 is 0. So the difference is 2B. 

So

---------------

 B = ħ²/(2I), so 2B = ħ²/I. Which matches the earlier calculation. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring

---------------

 to the transition between vibrational states with simultaneous change in rotational states? But that complicates things. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not

---------------

 considering rotational transitions and just wants the vibrational, since the parameters for rotation might not be necessary. 

The problem gives the

---------------

 angular frequency of vibration (w =4e14 rad/s), which is needed for the vibrational transition. The other parameters (masses and bond length) are perhaps for

---------------

 a different question, but in this case, since the answer comes out correctly with the vibrational transition, maybe that's the intended path. 

Given

---------------

 that, the momentum would be 1.4e-28, which is option D. 

Alternatively, maybe I messed up the calculation

---------------

 steps. Let me recheck the vibrational calculation. 

ΔE_vib = ħω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 

Let me compute 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.21828e-20 J. 

Divided by c (3e8 m/s): 

4.21828e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg·m/s. 

Yes, exactly. 

So that's option D. 

Perhaps

---------------

 the mention of rotation is a distractor. The question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy". The fundamental state (n=0) can transition to n=1, which is the first excited state. Since

---------------

 rotational transitions are lower energy, but the problem gives the vibrational frequency, and the masses and bond length are perhaps for another part. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is in

---------------

 error, but since the given options include D which matches the vibrational calculation, I think that's the intended answer. 

Therefore, the answer is D.


To determine the momentum of a photon required for the diatomic molecule to transition from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state, we consider the vibrational transition since the problem provides the vibrational angular frequency (ω) and the answer

---------------

 options align with the vibrational energy calculation. 

The fundamental state corresponds to the ground vibrational state (n=0). The next lowest energy state is the first excited vibrational state (n=1). The energy difference for this transition is given by ΔE_vib = ħω. 

Given:
- Planck's constant ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s
- Angular frequency ω = 4×10¹⁴ rad/s

The energy difference is:
ΔE_vib = (1.0545718e-34 J·s)(4×10¹⁴ rad/s) ≈ 4.218×10⁻²⁰ J

The photon's momentum (p) is related to its energy (E) by E = pc, where c is the speed of light (3×10⁸ m/s). Solving for p:
p = ΔE_vib / c = (4.218×10⁻²⁰ J) / (3×10⁸ m/s) ≈ 1.4×10⁻²⁸ N·s

This matches option D. The rotational transition was considered but resulted in an answer not listed, suggesting the question focuses on the vibrational transition.
