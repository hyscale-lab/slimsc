Okay, let's see. The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet_4 and Planet_2, which are in a system with orbital resonances. The given orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. And they all have the same albedo. I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature. I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature relates to the distance from the star, right? The formula is something like T = T_star * (R/(2a))^(1/4), where R is the radius of the star's orbit or something? Wait, maybe I should recall it properly. Oh right, the equilibrium temperature depends on the inverse square root of the semi-major axis. Let me think. The equilibrium temperature equation is T = T_sun * ( (1 AU)/ (a) )^(1/2) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4). Wait, no, maybe the

---------------

 exact formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ), but maybe I need to consider

---------------

 the stellar luminosity?

Alternatively, the Stefan-Boltzmann law comes into play here. The equilibrium temperature is determined by the balance between the incoming stellar radiation and the planet's own thermal emission. The formula is usually given as T_eq^4 = (L_star/(16πσa²)) * (1 - albedo), where L is the star's luminosity. Since all planets are around the same star, L and σ are constants. Also, if the albedo is the same for all, that term cancels out when taking the ratio. 

So, to find the ratio T4/T2, since T^4 is proportional to 1/a², the ratio would be ( (a2/a4) )^(1/2). Wait, let's see:

Let me write it out step by step. 

Let’s denote T_eq as

---------------

 the equilibrium temperature. Then,

T_eq ∝ (L / a²)^(1/4) * (1/(1 - albedo))^(1/4). 

But since the albedo is the same for both planets, the (1 - albedo) term is a common factor and can be factored out. Since the question states they have the same albedo, that term will cancel when taking the ratio between the two. Therefore, the ratio of temperatures depends only on the ratio of their distances from the star, raised

---------------

 to the 1/4 power. Wait, wait, let's get the exact proportionality.

The equilibrium temperature formula is:



---------------

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( sqrt( R^2 / (4a^2) ) )? Hmm, maybe I need to recall

---------------

 it properly. Let's think of it this way: The equilibrium temperature is proportional to (L/(a²))^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity. Since L is the same for both planets, the ratio T4/T2 would be ( (a2/a4)^2 )^(1/4) ? Wait, let me get

---------------

 this straight. Let me re-derive it quickly.

The energy absorbed by the planet is proportional to L/(4πa²) (since the star's luminosity spreads out over a sphere of radius a). The planet's cross-sectional area is πr², so the absorbed power is L/(4πa²) * πr² = L r²/(4a²). The planet then radiates as a blackbody, with power σ T^4 * 4πr². Setting them equal (assuming equilibrium):

σ T_eq^4 *4πr² = L r²/(4a²) * (1 - albedo)

Wait, but

---------------

 actually, the albedo term is (1 - albedo) because the planet reflects some of the light. So the absorbed energy is (1 - albedo) times the incoming flux. 

So

---------------

 rearranged, T_eq^4 = (L (1 - albedo) ) / (16 π σ a² )

Therefore

---------------

, T_eq is proportional to sqrt( (1 - albedo)/a² )^(1/2) )? Wait, no, let's see. Let

---------------

 me write it again:

T_eq^4 ∝ (L / a² ) * (1 - albedo)

Therefore

---------------

, T_eq ∝ ( (1 - albedo)/a² )^(1/4 )

Since (1 - albedo) is the same for both planets, the

---------------

 ratio of temperatures would be ( (a2/a4)^2 )^(1/4) ?

Wait, no. Let me see

---------------

:

Let’s write T4 / T2 = [ ( (1 - alb)/a4² ) / ( (1 - alb)/a2² ) ]^(1/4 )

Wait, no

---------------

, better to write each temperature:

T4^4 ∝ (1/a4² )

T2^4 ∝ (1/a2² )

So the ratio (T4 / T2)^4 = (a2²)/(a4²) 

Therefore, T4 / T2 = (a2 / a4)^(1/2) 

Ah, right! So the ratio of temperatures is the square root of the inverse of the ratio of their semi-major axes. Because T is proportional to 1/a^(1/2), so T4 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 )

So

---------------

 I need to find the ratio of their distances a2/a4, take the square root, and that's the temperature ratio.

Now, to find a2 and a4, the

---------------

 semi-major axes. Since the planets are in orbital resonance, their orbital periods are in a ratio given (1:2:2.5:3.5:5). The orbital periods are P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. 

Kepler's third law states that P² ∝ a³, so the ratio of their semi-major axes can be found from the ratio of their periods. 

Let me denote the periods as P1 = T, P2=2T, P3=2.5T, P4=3.5T, P5=5T. 

We

---------------

 need to find a2/a4. 

Using Kepler's third law: (P2/P4)^2 = (a2^3 / a4^3) 

Wait, no

---------------

: P² ∝ a³, so (P2 / P4)^2 = (a2 / a4)^3 

Therefore, (a2/a4) = (P2/P4)^(2/3)

So

---------------

, substituting the periods: P2 is 2T, P4 is 3.5T. So the ratio P2/P4 = 2/3.5 = 4/7. 

So (a2/a4) = (4/7)^(2/3) 

Wait, let me compute that. Let me write 

---------------

4/7 as (2^2)/(7). 

But maybe better to compute numerically. 

First, 4 divided by 7 is approximately 0.5714. 

Take

---------------

 the 2/3 power of that. Let me compute 0.5714^(2/3). 

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 I can write it as (4/7)^(2/3) = ( (4/7)^2 )^(1/3) 

(

---------------

4/7)^2 = 16/49 ≈ 0.3265. Then take the cube root of that. 

Cube root of 0.3265. Let me think: 0.7^3 is 0.343, which is a bit higher. So cube root of 0.3265 is approximately

---------------

 0.688 (since 0.69^3 is about 0.3285). Hmm

---------------

, that's close. So 0.69 approximately. 

Wait, but let me check:

Let me compute (4/7)^(2/3). Let me use

---------------

 logarithms. 

ln(4/7) = ln(4) - ln(7) ≈ 1.386 - 1.946 = -0.56. 

Multiply by 2/3: -0.56*(2/3) ≈ -0.373. Exponentiate: e^-0.373 ≈ 0.688. So approximately

---------------

 0.688. 

So (a2/a4) ≈ 0.688. 

Then, the temperature ratio T4/T2 is sqrt( a2/a4 ) = sqrt(0.688) ≈ ?

Square root of 0.688: sqrt(0.64) is 0.8, sqrt(0.7225) is 0.85. 0.688 is between those. Let me compute 0.83 squared is 0.6889, which is very close. So sqrt(0.688) is approximately 0.83. 

Wait, wait

---------------

. Wait a second. Wait, I thought the temperature ratio was sqrt( a2 / a4 ), which would be sqrt(0.688) ≈ 0.83. 

But hold

---------------

 on, let me double-check the steps. 

We had:

T4 / T2 = (a2 / a4)^(1/2) 

Wait, because

---------------

 (T4/T2)^4 = (a2²)/(a4²) → (T4/T2)^4 = (a2/a4)^2 → so

---------------

 T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2). Yes, that's correct. 

So the

---------------

 temperature ratio T4 over T2 is sqrt(a2/a4). 

So since a2/a4 is (4/7)^(2/3) ≈ 0.688, so sqrt(0.688) ≈ 0.829, which is approximately 0.83. 

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83. So the answer should be C. 

Wait, but let me check again to

---------------

 be sure I didn't flip any ratios. 

Wait, the question is the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So T4 / T2. 

The

---------------

 orbital period ratio of Planet_2 to Planet_4 is 2:3.5, so P2/P4 = 2/3.5 = 4/7. 

Ke

---------------

pler's third law: (P2/P4)^2 = (a2^3 / a4^3). 

So (a2/a4)^3 = (P2/P4)^2 → (a2/a4) = (P2/P4)^(2/3). 

Yes, so that's (4/7)^(2/3). 

Then, T4/T2 is sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt( (4/7)^(2/3) ) = (4/7)^(1/3). 

Wait wait, hold on! Wait, sqrt

---------------

( (4/7)^(2/3) ) is equal to (4/7)^( (2/3)*(1/2) ) = (4/7)^(1/3). Oh no! Wait, I made a mistake here. 

Wait, let

---------------

 me re-calculate that step. 

The temperature ratio is sqrt(a2/a4). But a2/a4 is (P2/P4)^(2/3). 

Therefore, T4/T2 = sqrt( (P2/P4)^(2/3) ) = (P2/P4)^(1/3). 

Ah! Oh

---------------

 my goodness, I see my mistake. So I incorrectly took the square root of the a ratio, but since a2/a4 is (P2/P4)^(2/3), then sqrt(a2/a4) would be (P2/P4)^(1/3). 

Therefore, the

---------------

 correct calculation is (4/7)^(1/3). 

Oh no! That changes everything. So I messed up the

---------------

 exponents earlier. Let me recalculate. 

So let me start over on that part:

We have:

(T4 / T2) = sqrt( (a2 / a4) )

But (a2/a4) = (P2/P4)^(2/3)

Therefore,

(T4/T2) = sqrt( (P2/P4)^(2/3) ) = (P2/P4)^(1/3)

So,

---------------

 P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5. So the ratio P2/P4 = 2 / 3.5 = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714

Thus

---------------

, (4/7)^(1/3). 

So compute (4/7)^(1/3). Let me compute that. 

4/7 ≈ 0.5714. 

Cube root of 0.5714. 

The cube of 0.8 is 0.512. The cube of 0.83 is approximately

---------------

 0.5718. 

Wait, 0.83^3 = (0.8)^3 + 3*(0.8)^2*(0.03) + 3*(0.8)*(0.03)^2 + (0.03)^3 

But maybe easier

---------------

 to compute numerically:

0.83^3 = 0.83 * 0.83 = 0.6889; then 0.6889 * 0.83 ≈ 0.6889*0.8 = 0.5511 plus 0.6889*0.03 = ~0.0207 → total ≈ 0.5718. 

So 0.83 cubed is approximately 0.5718, which is almost exactly 4/7 (since 4 divided by 7 is 0.5714). 

Therefore, (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83. 

Wait, so that would make T4/T2 ≈ 0.83, which is option C. Wait, but that

---------------

's the same as before. Wait, but I thought I made a mistake. 

Wait, let's clarify:

Wait, the

---------------

 cube root of (4/7) is approximately 0.83. 

So the temperature ratio T4/T2 is approximately 0.83. 

Therefore

---------------

 the answer is C) ~0.83. 

Wait, but earlier I thought the same, but my initial mistake

---------------

 was thinking that sqrt( (4/7)^(2/3) ) equals (4/7)^(1/3) which is correct. So that

---------------

's exactly what I did. 

Wait, so then my first calculation was correct. So the answer is C. 

Hmm. Let me confirm

---------------

 with another approach. Let's assign actual values. Let's say the orbital periods are 2, 3.5 (since P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5). 

Using Kepler's third law, a^3 is proportional to P^2, so a2^3 / a4^3 = (P2^2)/(P4^2) 

Therefore, a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3) 

So (

---------------

2 / 3.5)^(2/3). 

Let me compute 2/3.5 = 4/7. 

So

---------------

 (4/7)^(2/3) is a2/a4. 

Then, the temperature ratio is sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt( (4/7)^(2/3) ) = (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83. 

Yes. So the temperature ratio of Planet4 to Planet2 is ~0.83. 

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83, so the answer is C. 

Wait, but wait,

---------------

 let me check if I have the ratio the right way. The question says "ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2", so T4/T2. 

Yes, that's exactly what I calculated. So yes

---------------

, 0.83 is correct. 

Hmm, but let me check if maybe I confused albedo or something else. The question says same albedo, so that term cancels. So I

---------------

 think that's okay. 

Therefore the answer should be C.


To determine the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the relationship derived from the equilibrium temperature formula and Kepler's third law. The equilibrium temperature \( T_{\text{eq}} \) is proportional to \( (1/a)^{1/2} \), where \( a \) is the semi-major axis. Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto a^3 \), the ratio of semi-major axes \( a_2/a_4 \) is given by \( (P_2/P_4)^{2/3} \). 

Given the orbital periods \( P_2 = 2 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5 \), the ratio \( P_2/P_4 = 2/3.5 = 4/7 \). Thus, \( a_2/a_4 = (4/7)^{2/3} \). The temperature ratio \( T_4/T_2 \) is the square root of this value:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3}} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.83.
\]

This matches option C.
