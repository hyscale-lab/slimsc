Okay, so I have to figure out the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution for these five compounds. Let me start by recalling what factors affect nucleophilicity in water. 

First, nucleophilicity is the ability of a nucleophile to donate an electron pair. In polar protic solvents like water, the strength of the nucleophile can be influenced by the

---------------

 solvent's ability to solvate the ions. Strongly solvated ions might be less reactive because they're more stabilized and not as available to attack the electrophile.

The given nucleophiles are: 
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (which is the conjugate base of 4-methylcyclohexanol, I think)
2. Hydroxide (OH-)
3. Propionate (CH

---------------

2CH2COO^-? Wait, propionate is the conjugate base of propanoic acid, so maybe

---------------

 CH3CH2COO^-)
4. Methanol (CH3OH, which is a neutral nucleophile)
5. Ethanethiolate (C2H5S^-;

---------------

 the conjugate base of ethanethiol, which is ethyl mercaptan)

Hmm. Let me list them again with their actual formulas to make sure. 

1

---------------

. 4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate: that's the deprotonated form of 4-methylcyclohexanol. So the anion would have an -O^- group attached to the 1-position. The structure is like a cyclohexane ring with a methyl group on the 4-carbon, and the oxygen on

---------------

 the 1-carbon with a negative charge.

2. Hydroxide (OH^-). That's just the hydroxide ion.

3. Propionate (CH3CH2COO^-). The conjugate base of propanoic acid. 

4. Methanol (CH3OH). That

---------------

's a neutral molecule, so it can act as a nucleophile but since it's not deprotonated, maybe it's less nucleophilic compared to the anions here.

5. Ethanethiolate (C2H5S^-). The conjugate base of ethanethiol (C2H5SH). The sulfur is more electronegative than oxygen? Wait, no, sulfur is less electronegative than oxygen. Wait, but in terms of nucleophilicity, in

---------------

 polar protic solvents, the larger atoms like sulfur have better nucleophilicity because they're less solvated. Wait, but in

---------------

 water (a polar protic solvent), the solvation effect is important. 

Let me think step by step. 

First, the

---------------

 nucleophiles here include both ions (the anions) and a neutral molecule (methanol). The order is from most to least reactive. 

In

---------------

 aqueous solution (polar protic), the solvation of the anions will affect their nucleophilicity. The more sol

---------------

vated an anion is, the less nucleophilic it is because the solvent molecules are tightly bound to it. 

So, the

---------------

 order of nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents for similar anions is generally: 
Sulfur-based anions (like thiolates) > oxygen-based (like hydroxide, alkoxides) > carboxylates. 

Wait, let

---------------

's think about the common order. For example, in polar protic solvents, the nucleophilicity of the anions goes

---------------

: RS- > RO- > RC(O)O^- (carboxylates). 

So ethanethiolate (RS

---------------

-) would be more nucleophilic than hydroxide (OH^-), which in turn is more than alkoxides (like the 4-methylcyclohexanolate, which is an alkoxide), and then the propionate (carboxylate) would be even less. 

Wait, but wait

---------------

. Wait, the propionate is a carboxylate anion. Carboxylate anions are generally poor nucleophiles in polar protic solvents because they are highly solvated. So that

---------------

 would be the weakest here among the anions. 

Methanol is a neutral nucleophile, so it's going to be the

---------------

 least nucleophilic because it can't approach the electrophile as effectively as the charged anions. 

So putting this together: 

The most nucleophilic would be ethanethiolate (5), then hydroxide (2). Then comes the alkoxide (1: 4-methylcyclohexanolate). Next would be the propionate (3), and the least is methanol (4). 

Wait, but wait, what

---------------

 about the alkoxide? The 4-methylcyclohexanolate is an alkoxide (RO^-), so in

---------------

 the order, after hydroxide (OH^-), which is also an alkoxide (since OH^- is RO^- where R is H). Wait, but hydro

---------------

xide is actually the simplest. The general trend for alkoxides is that bulkier alkoxides are less nucleophilic because of more solvation? Or is

---------------

 it the other way around?

Wait, no. The solvation of alkoxides: the more substituted the alkoxide (the larger the R group), the less solvated it is because the bulky R group shields the oxygen from the solvent. Wait, in polar protic solvents, the solvation is stronger

---------------

 when the anion is smaller. For example, methoxide (CH3O^-) is more solvated than a larger alkoxide like t

---------------

-butoxide (t-C4H9O^-), which is less solvated. Wait, but I might be getting confused here. Let me think again.

In polar protic solvents, the solvation energy is higher for ions that have a higher charge density. Since

---------------

 the charge is on the oxygen in alkoxides, but the size of the R group affects the effective charge density. A bulk

---------------

ier R group would mean the oxygen is more "shielded" from the solvent, so it's less solvated. So

---------------

 a larger R group (like in t-butyl) would lead to less solvation, so the nucleophile is more available, hence more nucleophilic. 

Therefore, in the case of the alkoxide,

---------------

 the 4-methylcyclohexanolate (R = 4-methylcyclohexyl) would be a larger

---------------

 and bulkier group than, say, methoxide. So compared to hydroxide (which is R=H), the hydroxide is more

---------------

 solvated. Wait, but hydroxide is the smallest, so the most solvated. Wait, so perhaps

---------------

 the order of the alkoxides would be: 

The smaller the R group, the more solvated. So hydro

---------------

xide (R=H) is the most solvated, so least nucleophilic. Wait, but that's conflicting with the

---------------

 earlier thought. Wait, perhaps I have this reversed.

Wait, the more solvated the anion, the less nucleophilic it is, because the solvent is holding it tightly. So the

---------------

 less solvated anions are better nucleophiles. 

So for alkoxides, the more bulky the R group, the less solvated the anion, so the more nucleophilic. 

Therefore, the

---------------

 hydroxide (OH^-) is the most solvated (since R is H, so the oxygen is exposed and can

---------------

 form many H-bonds with water), so it's the least nucleophilic among the alkoxides. Wait, but then the

---------------

 4-methylcyclohexanolate would be less solvated than hydroxide, so more nucleophilic than hydroxide? 

Wait, but in

---------------

 the options given, the hydroxide is in position 2, which is better than the alkoxide (1). Hmm. Wait

---------------

 maybe I need to check the actual order. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the actual order of nucleophilicity of these specific ions in water.

Let me list

---------------

 the nucleophiles again:

1. 4-methylcyclohexanolate (alkoxide, R is a large group)
2. Hydroxide (OH^-)
3. Propionate (carboxylate)
4. Methanol (neutral)
5. Ethanethiolate (RS^-)

In

---------------

 polar protic solvents (like water), the order of nucleophilicity is generally:

RS- (thiolate) > RO- (alkoxide) > OH- > carboxylate (RCO2^-)

Wait, that can

---------------

't be. Wait, let me recall standard comparisons. 

Wait, the nucleophilicity order in polar protic solvents (like water) is:



---------------

Thiols (RS-) are better nucleophiles than alcohols (ROH). Their conjugate bases (thiolates RS^-) are better nucleophiles than alkoxides (RO^-), because sulfur is less electronegative and has

---------------

 a larger atomic radius, so the electron pair is easier to donate. 

So, in polar protic solvents, the order would

---------------

 be: 

RS^- > RO^- > OH^- ?

Wait, but OH^- is a stronger base than RO^-? No, wait, alk

---------------

oxides are stronger bases than hydroxide. Wait, but in terms of nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents, maybe the order is different. 

Wait, let

---------------

's look up the standard order (but since I can't, I have to recall). 

In polar protic solvents, the nucleophilicity order of common

---------------

 anions is:

RS- > RO- (but with some variation based on R's size) > OH- > carboxylate (RCO2^-)

Wait, but hydro

---------------

xide (OH^-) is a stronger base than alkoxides (RO^-), but in terms of nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents, the alk

---------------

oxides are less nucleophilic than hydroxide because they are more solvated? Wait, no. Wait, maybe

---------------

 I have it wrong. Let me think again. 

Wait, hydroxide (OH^-) is a very strong base but in polar protic solvents, the OH^- is highly solvated, so its nucleophilicity is actually lower than some

---------------

 other anions. For example, alkyl sulfides (RS^-) are better nucleophiles in polar protic solvents than RO^- because

---------------

 they are less solvated. Wait, no, maybe. 

Alternatively, maybe the order is like this:

In polar protic solvents:

S

---------------

ulfur-based anions (RS^-) are better nucleophiles than oxygen-based (RO^-), because the larger S atom has a weaker interaction with the solvent. So RS

---------------

^- is less solvated, so more nucleophilic.

Then among oxygen-based anions, the more substituted alkoxides (like t-butoxide) are better nucleophiles than less substituted ones (like methoxide) because they are less solvated. 

So,

---------------

 comparing hydroxide (OH^-) with an alkoxide like 4-methylcyclohexanolate: the hydroxide is the

---------------

 least substituted (R=H), so it's the most solvated. The 4-methylcyclohexanolate has a larger R group, so it's less solvated, so more nucleophilic than hydroxide. 

Wait, so then

---------------

 the order would be:

Ethanethiolate (5) > 4-methylcyclohexanolate (1) > hydroxide (2) > propionate (3) > methanol (4). But looking at the options, this

---------------

 isn't exactly matching any. Wait, let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) 5, 2, 3, 1 and 4

B) 2, 5, 1, 4 and 3

C) 2, 5, 3, 4 and 3 (duplicate

---------------

?)

D)5, 2, 1, 3 and 4

Hmm. Let me re-express my current

---------------

 thought.

First, the most nucleophilic is ethanethiolate (5). Then comes the alkoxide (1:

---------------

 4-methylcyclohexanolate) because it's less solvated than hydroxide. Then comes hydroxide (2). Then propionate (3) as

---------------

 a carboxylate, and finally methanol (4). That order would be 5,1,2,3,4. But that's not any of the options. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think again. 

Wait, hydroxide (OH^-) is an anion with a very small size. In

---------------

 polar protic solvents, the solvent molecules can form strong hydrogen bonds with the oxygen. So it's highly solvated, making it a weak nucleophile. 

The 4-methylcyclohexanolate is an alkoxide with a large R group (4-methylcyclohexyl). Since the R group is bulky, the oxygen is shielded from the solvent, so it's less solvated. Therefore, it should be more nucleophilic than hydroxide. 

So the

---------------

 order of nucleophilicity would be:

Ethanethiolate (5) > 4-methylcyclohexanolate (1) > hydroxide (2) > propionate (3) > methanol (4).

But none

---------------

 of the options have this. Let's check the options again. 

Looking at option D: 5, 2, 1, 3, 4. That's 5 (ethanethiolate) first, then hydroxide (2), then alkoxide (1), then propionate, then methanol. That contradicts my previous conclusion because I thought the alkoxide (1) should be more nucleophilic than hydroxide (2). 

Hmm. Maybe I messed

---------------

 up the order between hydroxide and the alkoxide. Let me think again. 

Wait, the hydroxide is RO^- where R is H. The alkoxide (like the 4-methylcyclohexanolate) has a larger R group. Since the larger

---------------

 R group reduces solvation, the alkoxide should be a better nucleophile than hydroxide. So the alkoxide (1) is more nucleophilic than hydroxide (2). 

So the

---------------

 order would be 5 (ethanethiolate), then 1, then 2, then 3, then 4. 

Looking at the options, none have that. The

---------------

 closest is option D: 5,2,1,3,4? No, that's 5 first, then 2, then 1. So

---------------

 that's not right. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in comparing the hydroxide and the alkoxide. Maybe in some

---------------

 cases, the hydroxide is better? 

Wait, let me think of examples. For instance, comparing methoxide (CH3O^-) and hydroxide (OH^-). In polar protic solvents, methoxide is less solvated than hydroxide, so it should be more nucleophilic. 

So

---------------

 the hydroxide is worse than methoxide. Similarly, the 4-methylcyclohexanolate would be even less solvated than methoxide, so even better. So the

---------------

 alkoxide (1) is better than hydroxide (2). 

So the correct order should be 5 (ethanethiolate) first, then 1 (alkoxide), then hydroxide (2), then propionate (3), then methanol (4). 

Looking at the options again:

Option D is 5,2,1,3,4. Which

---------------

 is not matching. 

Hmm. Let's check the options again. 

Option A: 5,2,3,1,4. So after 5 comes 2 (hydroxide), then propionate (3?),

---------------

 but propionate is a carboxylate which is even weaker. 

Option B: 2 (hydroxide) first? That can't be, since ethanethiolate should be first. 

Option C: starts with 2 (hydroxide), so wrong. 

Option D: starts with 5, then 2 (hydroxide), then 1 (alkoxide). 



---------------

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. 

Wait, perhaps the propionate's position is correct

---------------

. The carboxylate (propionate) is the weakest. 

Wait, maybe the order is:

Ethanethiolate (5) > hydroxide (2) > alkoxide (1) > propionate (3) > methanol (4). 

Then

---------------

 that would be 5,2,1,3,4, which is option D. 

But why would hydroxide come before the alkoxide?

Ah! Wait a second. Maybe I mixed

---------------

 up the substituents. The 4-methylcyclohexanolate's R group is 4-methylcyclohexyl. The

---------------

 size of that R group is larger than, say, a methyl group. So the alkoxide here is quite bulky. So in

---------------

 that case, the solvation would be even less than methoxide. 

But hydroxide's R is H, so the oxygen is very

---------------

 exposed. So, the solvation of hydroxide is higher than the alkoxide, making hydroxide less nucleophilic than the alkoxide. 

So then

---------------

, why would option D have hydroxide (2) before the alkoxide (1)? 

Hmm. Maybe the question is considering

---------------

 the leaving group ability instead of nucleophilicity? No, the question is about nucleophilicity. 

Alternatively, maybe the order

---------------

 of alkoxide and hydroxide depends on other factors. 

Wait, perhaps the hydroxide ion is a better nucleophile than some alkoxides?

---------------

 Let me think of specific examples. 

In polar protic solvents, the order of nucleophilicity among alkoxides and hydroxide is:



---------------

RO^- (alkoxide) > OH^- (hydroxide). 

So the hydroxide is less nucleophilic than the alkoxide. 

Therefore, in this case, the 4-methylcyclohexanolate (alkoxide) should be more nucleophilic than hydroxide. 

So the correct order should be 5 (ethanethiolate), then alkoxide (1), then hydroxide (2), then propionate (3), then methanol (4). 

But none of the options have that. The options given are:

A) 5,2,3,1,4 → 5 first, then hydroxide, then propionate, then alkoxide? That can't be right. 

B) 2,5,1,4,3 → starts with hydroxide, which is wrong. 

C) 2,5,3,4,3 → duplicate 

---------------

3, so probably wrong. 

D) 5,2,1,3,4 → 5, then hydroxide, then alkoxide, then propionate, then methanol. 

Wait, but

---------------

 according to my reasoning, alkoxide (1) should come before hydroxide (2), so D has the reverse. 

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. 

Wait, perhaps the 

---------------

4-methylcyclohexanolate is actually less nucleophilic than hydroxide? 

Wait, if the alkoxide's R group is large

---------------

, but the hydroxide is a much smaller ion, maybe the hydroxide can approach the electrophile more easily?

---------------

 

Wait, no. Because in solvents like water, the solvation is the main factor. The more solvated the anion, the less nucleophilic. 

Hydroxide is highly

---------------

 solvated, so it's less nucleophilic than the less solvated alkoxide. 

Thus, the order between alkoxide and hydroxide should be alkoxide (1) before

---------------

 hydroxide (2). 

Hmm, but then the correct order would be 5 (ethanethiolate), then 1 (alkoxide), then hydroxide (2), then propionate (3), then methanol (4). 

Looking at the options, this isn't any of them. 

Wait, maybe the question is considering

---------------

 the solvent effect differently? 

Alternatively, perhaps the propionate's position is misplaced. 

Wait, propionate is a carboxylate. Carboxylate anions are known

---------------

 to be poor nucleophiles in polar protic solvents because they are highly solvated. So they should be at

---------------

 the end. 

Wait, the options given for D have propionate (3) before methanol (4). Methanol is neutral, so it's the

---------------

 least nucleophilic. So propionate (3) is better than methanol (4), which makes sense. 

So the

---------------

 correct order would be:

5 (ethanethiolate) > 1 (alkoxide) > 2 (hydroxide) > 3 (propionate) > 4 (methanol). 

But this is not present

---------------

 in the options. The options are:

Option D is 5,2,1,3,4. 

Hmm, maybe the alk

---------------

oxide is actually less nucleophilic than hydroxide here? How?

Wait, perhaps the size of the alkoxide's R group is

---------------

 making it too bulky, so even though it's less solvated, the steric hindrance makes it a worse nucleophile. 

Wait, st

---------------

eric hindrance can affect nucleophilicity. A bulky R group might make it harder for the oxygen to approach the electrophilic center. 

Ah! That's an important point I missed

---------------

 earlier. 

So, while the 4-methylcyclohexanolate has a large R group (4-methylcyclohexyl), which reduces solvation, making it less solvated (better nucleophile), but the steric bulk might hinder the approach to the electrophile. 

In that case, the st

---------------

eric hindrance could reduce its nucleophilicity. 

So comparing hydroxide (OH^-) and the 4-methylcyclohexanolate (which

---------------

 is a bulky alkoxide):

The hydroxide has no steric hindrance, so even though it's more solvated, its lack of steric hindrance might make it a better nucleophile than the bulky alkoxide. 

Therefore

---------------

, in such cases, the hydroxide (2) would be more nucleophilic than the bulky alkoxide (1). 

Ah

---------------

, that makes sense. So the steric hindrance can override the solvation effect. 

So the order would then be:

Ethanethiolate (5) > hydroxide (2) > alkoxide (1) > propionate (3) > methanol (4). 

Which is exactly option D: 5,2,1,3,4. 

Because

---------------

 the hydroxide is better than the bulky alkoxide due to less steric hindrance. 

Therefore, the correct answer is D. 

Wait, but I need to confirm that. 

Ster

---------------

ic hindrance in the alkoxide would make it less nucleophilic because the bulky group prevents the oxygen from approaching the electrophile. 

So even though the alkoxide is less solvated, its steric bulk makes

---------------

 it worse than hydroxide. 

Therefore, the order is 5 (ethanethiolate), then hydroxide (2), then the bulky alkoxide (1), then propionate, then methanol. 

So

---------------

 option D is the correct answer. 

So the answer is D.


To determine the nucleophilicity order in aqueous solution, we consider solvation effects and steric hindrance. In polar protic solvents like water, nucleophilicity decreases with stronger solvation. Sulfur-based anions (RS⁻) are more nucleophilic than oxygen-based anions due to weaker solvation. Among alkoxides (RO⁻), st

---------------

eric hindrance can reduce nucleophilicity. 

1. **Ethanethiolate (5)**: As an RS⁻ anion, it has weaker solvation and stronger

---------------

 nucleophilicity.
2. **Hydroxide (2)**: Smaller and less sterically hindered than bulky alkoxides, making it more nucleophilic despite being solvated.
3. **4-Methylcyclohexanolate (1)**: Bul

---------------

ky R group causes steric hindrance, reducing its nucleophilicity compared to hydroxide.
4. **Propionate (3)**: Carboxylate anion is highly solvated, making it a poor nucleophile.
5. **Methanol (4)**: Neutral, so least nucleophilic.

The correct order is **5 (ethanethiolate) > 2 (hydroxide) > 1 (alkoxide) > 3 (propionate) > 4 (methanol)**, corresponding to **Option D**.

Answer: D<|im_end|>
