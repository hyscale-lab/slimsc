Okay, so I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z for the given state. Hmm, the uncertainty is calculated using the formula sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). Right, that's the standard formula for uncertainty. 

First, I should figure out the expectation value of P_z, ⟨P_z⟩, and then the expectation value of P_z squared, ⟨P_z²⟩. Then subtract the square of the first from the second and take the square root. 

The state vector is given as a column vector: [-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2]. Let me write that down. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so each component of the state corresponds to the amplitude for each eigenstate of P_z. 

The P_z matrix is diagonal, as

---------------

 given. The first row first column is ℏ, second row second is 0, third row third is -ℏ. So the eigenvalues for P_z are ℏ, 0, and -ℏ, corresponding to the basis vectors |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩ respectively. 

Wait, so the state vector components are in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors. The state is written as a column vector with entries (

---------------

ψ₁, ψ₂, ψ₃) = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). 

To compute ⟨P_z⟩, I need to take the conjugate transpose of the state vector, multiply by the P_z matrix, then multiply by the state vector. Since all the entries in the state are real numbers, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. 

Let me compute ⟨P_z⟩ first. 

The expectation value is ψ* P_z ψ. 

Breaking it down:

⟨P_z⟩ = (-1/2)(ℏ) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(-ℏ). 

Wait, because each component of the state is

---------------

 multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue (since P_z is diagonal in this basis). Because in the basis of its eigenvectors, the expectation value is just the sum of (probability amplitude)^2 times eigenvalue. 

Wait, actually, more precisely, the expectation value is the sum over i,j of ψ_i*(P_z)_{i,j} ψ_j. Since P_z is diagonal, only the terms where i=j will survive. So:



---------------

⟨P_z⟩ = sum_{i=1 to 3} ψ_i*(P_z)_{i,i} ψ_i 

Which simplifies to each component squared (since P

---------------

_z diagonal entries are eigenvalues) multiplied by their eigenvalues. 

So let me compute that:

First term: (-1/2)^2 * ℏ =

---------------

 (1/4)ℏ 

Second term: (1/√2)^2 * 0 = 0 

Third term: (-1/2)^2 * (-ℏ) = (1/4)(-ℏ) 

Wait a second, hold on. Wait, no, actually

---------------

, the third term is (ψ_3)^2 multiplied by the eigenvalue for the third component, which is -ℏ. 

Wait, but let

---------------

 me clarify: the components of the state are the coefficients for each eigenvector. So the first component corresponds to the eigenvalue ℏ (since the first diagonal entry is ℏ), second component to eigenvalue 0, third to -ℏ. 

So the expectation value is:

( (-1/2)^2 * ℏ ) + ( (1/√2)^2 * 0 ) + ( (-1/2)^2 * (-ℏ) )

Calculating each term:

First term: (1/4)*ℏ 

Second term: 0 

Third term: (1/4)*(-ℏ) 

So total ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4 - 1/4)ℏ = 0? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, hold

---------------

 on, no. Wait, the third term's eigenvalue is -ℏ, so the term is ( (-1/2)^2 ) * (-ℏ) ?

Wait, (-

---------------

1/2)^2 is positive 1/4, so 1/4 * (-ℏ) = - (1/4)ℏ. 

So first term is (1/4)ℏ, third term is - (1/4)ℏ. So adding those gives 0. Then the second term is zero. So overall ⟨P_z⟩ = 0? 

Hmm, that's interesting. 

Now, moving on to ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared would just be the square of its diagonal entries. So each diagonal entry of P_z squared matrix is (ℏ)^2, 0^2, (-ℏ)^2, so ℏ², 0, ℏ². 

Therefore, ⟨P_z²⟩ is the sum of the squares of the eigenvalues multiplied by the square of their respective amplitudes. 

So again

---------------

:

First term: ( (-1/2)^2 )*(ℏ)^2 

Second term: ( (1/√2)^2 )*0^2 = 0 

Third term: ( (-1/2)^2 )*(-ℏ)^2 = (1/4)*(ℏ)^2 

Wait, because (-ℏ)^2 is ℏ squared. 

So first term: (1/4) ℏ² 

Third term: (1/4) ℏ² 

Second term: 0 

Total ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/4 + 1/4) ℏ² = (1/2) ℏ² 

So now, the uncertainty squared is ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² = (1/2 ℏ²) - (0)^2 = 1/2 ℏ² 

Therefore, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(1/2 ℏ²) = ℏ / sqrt(2) 

Wait, but let me check again. Because

---------------

 maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. 

Wait the state vector is given as the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ℏ. Wait, but the problem says the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ℏ, and the explicit form is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). 

Hmm, but

---------------

 in the problem statement, the state is given as the column vector with those components. So even if that's an eigenstate of P_x, when calculating P_z's expectation, we can proceed as above. 

Wait, but I thought

---------------

 maybe the components are normalized? Let me check if the state is normalized. 

The sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components should be 1. 

So

---------------

 (-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1/4 +1/4)=1/2 +1/2=1. So yes, it's normalized. So that's okay. 

So the

---------------

 calculation for ⟨P_z⟩ being zero and ⟨P_z²⟩ being (1/2)ℏ² seems correct. 

Therefore, the uncertainty is sqrt(1/2) ℏ, which is ℏ over sqrt(2). So the answer should be B. 

Wait, but let me think

---------------

 again. Wait, could there be a mistake in the P_z matrix? Let me check the problem statement again. 

The matrix for P_z: first row (ℏ, 0,0), second row (0,0,0), third row (0,0,-ℏ). So the eigenvalues for the basis vectors are ℏ, 0, -ℏ. 

Yes. So the components are correct. 

Another

---------------

 point: when calculating ⟨P_z⟩, the first term is (ψ₁)^2 * ℏ, but wait, actually, no

---------------

. Wait, expectation value is sum over |ψ_i|² times eigenvalue_i. 

Yes, because the operator P_z is diagonal, so the

---------------

 expectation is sum (ψ_i^* (P_z)_{ii} ψ_i) = sum |ψ_i|² (P_z)_{ii}. 

So the

---------------

 first term is ( (-1/2)^2 ) * ℏ, which is (1/4)ℏ. The second term is (1/√2)^2 * 0 =0. The third term is (-1/2)^2*(-ℏ) = (1/4)(-ℏ). 

Adding those gives (1/4 -1/4) ℏ =0. 

Yes

---------------

, so that's correct. 

Then ⟨P_z²⟩ is sum |ψ_i|² (P_z eigenvalue_i)^2. 

So first term: (1/4)*(ℏ)^2, third term: (1/4)*( -ℏ)^2 = (1/4)*ℏ². 

So total ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/4 +1/4)* ℏ² = 1/2 ℏ². 

So the

---------------

 variance is 1/2 ℏ², so the standard deviation is sqrt(1/2) ℏ = ℏ / sqrt(2). 

So the answer is B. 

Hmm, but wait, let

---------------

 me see if there's another approach. 

Alternatively, maybe I should compute P_z acting on the state vector and then compute the expectation. Let me try that. 

The state vector is |

---------------

ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. 

P

---------------

_z is a diagonal matrix: 

[ ℏ 0 0 

0 0 0 

0 0 -ℏ ]

So P_z |ψ⟩ would be: 

First component: ℏ*(-1/2) 

Second component: 0*(1/√2) =0 

Third component: -ℏ*(-1/2) = (ℏ/2) 

Thus, P_z |ψ⟩ = [ - (ℏ/2), 0, ℏ/2 ]^T 

Then ⟨ψ | P_z |ψ⟩ is the inner product of the original state and this vector. 

So,

---------------

 first component: (-1/2)*(-ℏ/2) = (1/4) ℏ 

Second component: (1/√2)*0 =0 

Third component: (-1/2)*(ℏ/2) = - (1/4) ℏ 

Adding them up gives (1/4 -1/4) ℏ =0. 

Same result as before. 

Now for ⟨P_z²⟩, compute P_z squared acting

---------------

 on |ψ⟩. 

P_z squared matrix is diagonal with entries ℏ², 0, ℏ². 

So P_z² |ψ⟩ would be:

First component: ℏ²*(-1/2) 

Second component: 0 

Third component: (ℏ²)*(-1/2) [

---------------

Wait, no. Wait, P_z squared's third entry is (-ℏ)^2 = ℏ². So third component is ℏ²*(-1/2). 

Wait, third

---------------

 component is (P_z squared)_{3,3} * ψ_3 = ℏ²*(-1/2). 

Wait, so P_z squared matrix

---------------

 is diagonal entries ℏ², 0, ℏ². 

Therefore, the third component would be ℏ²*(-1/2). 

Wait, so P_z squared acting on the state gives:

First component: ℏ²*(-1/2), 

Second component: 0, 

Third component: ℏ²*(-1/2). 

Then ⟨ψ | P_z² |ψ⟩ is the inner product of the original state with this vector. 

So first term: (-1/2)*( - ℏ²/2 ) = (1/4) ℏ² 

Second term: (1/√2)*0 =0 

Third term: (-1/2)*( - ℏ²/2 ) = (1/4) ℏ² 

Adding these gives (1/4 +1/4) ℏ² = 1/2 ℏ². 

Same as before. So variance is sqrt(1/2 ℏ²) = ℏ/sqrt(2). 

Therefore, the answer is B. 

Hmm, so

---------------

 I think that's correct. The options given are A) sqrt(2)ℏ, B) ℏ/sqrt(2), etc. So B is the right choice.


To calculate the uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\), we use the formula \(\sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}\).

**Step 1: Compute \(\langle P_z \rangle\)**  
The state vector is \(\psi = \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{pmatrix}\). The \(P_z\) matrix is diagonal with eigenvalues \(\hbar\), \(0\), and \(-\hbar\). The expectation value is:  
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 (-\hbar) = \frac{1}{4}\hbar + 0 - \frac{1}{4}\hbar = 0.
\]

**Step 2: Compute \(\langle P_z^2 \rangle\)**  
The \(P_z^2\) matrix has diagonal entries \(\hbar^2\), \(0\), and \(\hbar^2\). Thus,  
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2.
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the uncertainty**  
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\hbar^2 - 0} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

Answer: B) \(\hbar/\sqrt{2}\).

\boxed{B}

Answer: B<|im_end|>
