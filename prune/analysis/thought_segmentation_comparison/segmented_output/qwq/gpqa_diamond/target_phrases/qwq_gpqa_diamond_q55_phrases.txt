Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom transitions. The question is about the decay from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The options give possible routes and probabilities. Hmm, I need to recall the selection rules for dipole transitions.

First, the dipole transition selection rules in hydrogen. The main ones are that the change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number l must be ±1. Also, the magnetic quantum number m must change by 0 or ±1. 

---------------

Wait, but for electric dipole transitions specifically, the Δl has to be ±1, and Δm can be 0 or ±1. Also, the principal quantum number n can change by any amount as long as the other rules are satisfied, but the question mentions two dipole transitions, so the path must involve two steps.

The initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. Since the transitions are dipole allowed, each step must satisfy Δl = ±1. Let's see the possible paths.

First, from |3,0,0⟩, the first transition must go to a state where l changes by ±1. Since original l is 0, the next l can be 1 (since 0+1=1, or 0-1 is negative which isn't allowed here). So the first transition must go to l=1. The possible intermediate states would have l=1 and m can be 0±0, ±1. But the m has to change by 0, +1, or -1. So from m=0, the next m can be 0, +1, or -1. So possible intermediate states after the first transition are |n',1,m⟩ where m is 0,1,-1.

The next transition from there must go to the final state |1,0,0⟩. So from the intermediate state, the next transition must have Δl again ±1. Since the final l is 0, the intermediate l must be 1 (so that Δl is -1 for the second transition). So the intermediate must have l=1. 

So the first step must go to a state with l=1. The n for the intermediate state can be anything as long as the transitions are allowed. Let's look at the possible steps.

Possible paths:

First transition from 3,0,0 to some |n1,1,m1⟩, then to |1,0,0⟩. The second transition must have Δl = -1 (since going from l=1 to l=0). So the second transition is allowed. 

The options given are A, B, C, D. Let's check each.

Option A: 3→2,1,0 →1,0,0. The first transition is 3,0,0 to 2,1,0. Then from 2,1,0 to 1,0,0. Let's check the selection rules for each step.

First step: Δn= -1 (from 3 to 2), Δl= +1 (0→1), Δm=0. That's okay. Second transition: n goes from 2 to 1 (Δn=-1), Δl from 1 to 0 (Δl=-1), Δm from 0 to 0 (so Δm=0). So both steps satisfy the Δl=±1 and Δm 0 or ±1. So that's allowed.

Option B: 3→2,1,1 →1,0,0. First transition: Δl from 0→1 (okay), Δm from 0→1 (allowed). Second transition: l=1→0 (okay), m goes from 1→0 (Δm -1, which is allowed). So that path is also allowed. But the probability is given as 1/4 here.

Option C: similar to B but m=-1. The first transition would have m going from 0 to -1 (allowed), then m from -1 to 0 (allowed). So that path is also allowed. The probability here is 1/4 as well.

Option D: The path seems similar to A but the first transition is written as |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩, but the probability is 2/3. 

---------------

Wait, but the options might have a typo? Let me check the options again. The user input shows option D as starting with a missing |3,0,0⟩? 

---------------

Wait the user wrote: D) \rangle\rightarrow|2,1,0\rangle\rightarrow|1,0,0\rangle and 2/3. Hmm, maybe that's a typo and they meant the same as A but with a different probability. So probably D is same path as A but with different probability. 

Now, the question is which path is correct and what's the probability. The problem states that it decays via two dipole transitions. So the possible paths are A, B, C, or D. 

The key is to figure out the possible intermediate states and the probabilities. The question also says "the transition route and the corresponding probability". 

In hydrogen transitions, the probability of a transition is proportional to the square of the transition matrix element, but the question might be referring to the number of possible allowed paths and their probabilities. 

---------------

Alternatively, maybe the probabilities given are the branching ratios or the sum over possible m values. 

Wait, perhaps the question is about the possible paths and which one is correct. Let me think again. The initial state is l=0, so to go to l=1 in the first step. The first transition can have m changing by 0, +1, or -1. So from m=0, possible m values in the intermediate state are m=0, 1, -1. So there are three possible intermediate states for the first transition (since l=1 can have m=-1,0,1). However, the second transition must go to m=0. 

So for each of those intermediate states, the second transition must have Δm from the intermediate m to 0. 

So for the first transition:

Case 1: intermediate is |2,1,0⟩. Then the second transition must go from m=0 to m=0, which is allowed (Δm=0). So this is one possible path (A).

Case 2: intermediate is |2,1,1⟩. The second transition must have Δm from 1 to 0 (Δm=-1), which is allowed. So that's path B.

Case 3: intermediate is |2,1,-1⟩. Second transition must have Δm from -1 to 0 (Δm +1), allowed. That's path C.

Thus there are three possible paths, each with different m values. However, the options list A, B, C as different possibilities with different probabilities. 

The question says "the transition route and the corresponding probability". Since the problem is asking for the correct answer, perhaps only one of these is correct. The probabilities in the options vary between 1/3, 1/4, and 2/3. 

Hmm, perhaps the probability is the sum over all possible paths, but each path's probability is weighted by the possible m components. 

---------------

Alternatively, the probability for each path might depend on the angular momentum selection rules and the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. 



---------------

Alternatively, the question might be referring to the fact that when there are multiple possible paths, the total probability is split among them. For instance, if there are three possible paths (A, B, C), each with equal probability, then each would have probability 1/3. But the options for A have 1/3, which would make sense. But options B and C have 1/4, which doesn't add up. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the intermediate n can also be different? Wait, in the first step from n=3 to n=2, but maybe the first transition could go to n=1? Let's see. 

---------------

Wait, the first transition must go via dipole, so from n=3 to any n', but then the second transition must go to n=1. Let me see. 



---------------

Wait, the first transition could go to n=2 (as in the options) or perhaps n=4? But since the final is n=1, the second transition must decrease n. Let me see. Suppose first step is from 3,0,0 to n'=4, l=1, m=... but then the second step would have to go from n'=4 down to n=1, but that's possible but perhaps less likely. However, in the options given, the intermediate is n=2. So probably the question expects the path through n=2 first. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the possible paths are only those with n decreasing each time. Because when emitting a photon, the energy must decrease. Since the energy of the H atom is -13.6 eV /n². So going from n=3 (lower energy than n=2?) 

---------------

Wait, no, n=3 is higher energy than n=2. So transitions can go to lower n. So the first step from 3 can go to n=2 or n=1. 

---------------

Wait but the final is n=1. If first step went from 3 to 1, then the second step would have to go from 1 to something, which can't. So first transition must go to n=2 (since n can't jump directly to 1 in a dipole transition? 

---------------

Wait, let's check the first transition from n=3 to n=1. The Δn can be any except 0, but the Δl must be ±1. So from l=0 to l=1, so that's okay. Then, can the first step be 3→1, l=1? But in that case, the second transition would have to go from l=1 to l=0, which is allowed. But the options don't have that path. So perhaps the question assumes that the two transitions are via intermediate states with n=2. 

So assuming that the path is through n=2, then there are three possible paths (A, B, C). The probabilities for each would depend on the angular momentum factors. The selection rules for dipole transitions also involve the parity. Since the parity of a state is (-1)^l. So the initial state (l=0) has parity +1. The intermediate must have l=1 (parity -1), so that the parity changes, which is necessary for dipole transition. Similarly, the final state (l=0) has parity +1 again, so the second transition from l=1 (parity -1) to l=0 (parity +1) is okay. So parity is okay for all steps. 

Now, the probability for each transition would depend on the matrix elements. But maybe the question is simpler. Since there are three possible m paths (m=0, ±1), each path would have an equal probability? If so, then each of A, B, C would have probability 1/3. But in the options, A says 1/3, B and C say 1/4, so that might not fit. 

---------------

Alternatively, maybe the m=0 path is different? 

Alternatively, the total probability is split among the possible m transitions. For the first transition from |3,0,0⟩, the possible m for the intermediate are 0,1,-1. The probability for each of these m values would depend on the matrix elements. But in the electric dipole approximation, the transition rate is proportional to the square of the matrix element ⟨final|m e r Y_l m|initial⟩. 

The matrix element for the dipole transition between states depends on the angular parts. The integral involves the product of the initial and final spherical harmonics. 

The first transition is from l=0 to l'=1. The angular part of the dipole transition operator is proportional to Y_{1,m'}, so the matrix element would be proportional to the integral over Y_{1,m'} (from final) times Y_{0,0} (initial). The integral of Y_{1,m'} Y_{0,0} over the sphere is zero unless certain conditions. 

---------------

Wait, the integral of Y_{l'm'} Y_{l m} is proportional to delta_{ll'}, delta_{mm'}, but here the initial l is 0, so integrating Y_{1,m'} * Y_{0,0} would be zero unless l'=1 and l=0, but the integral would be zero except when... 

---------------

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of addition of angular momenta. 

Alternatively, the matrix element for the dipole transition between states with l and l' must satisfy |l' - 1| ≤ l ≤ l' +1. 

---------------

Wait, the dipole operator has angular momentum 1 (since it's a vector), so the transition must satisfy Δl = ±1. 

But the actual selection rules for the m values: the m' - m must equal the projection of the dipole operator's angular momentum. The dipole operator (proportional to r) has angular momentum 1, so the change in m is -1,0,+1. So the transition can have Δm = 0, ±1. 

Thus, the first transition from m=0 can go to m'=0, ±1. Each of these is allowed. The probability for each m' is determined by the square of the matrix element. 

The matrix element for the transition from |n,l,m⟩ to |n', l', m'⟩ is proportional to:

⟨n', l', m' | r | n, l, m ⟩ 

The radial part depends on n and n', but the angular part is given by the integral involving the spherical harmonics. 

The angular part of the dipole transition matrix element between l=0 and l'=1, m'=0 is proportional to ⟨Y_{1,0} | Y_{0,0}⟩, but actually, the dipole operator's angular part is a vector, so the matrix element involves the components. 



---------------

Alternatively, the matrix element for the dipole transition is given by:

⟨n', l', m' | e r Y_{1,m''} | n, l, m ⟩ 



---------------

Wait, the dipole transition operator is proportional to the position vector r, which can be expressed in terms of spherical harmonics. The matrix element for the transition would involve the product of the initial and final wavefunctions. 

The exact calculation might be complex, but perhaps the probabilities for each m' are equal? If so, then the three possibilities (m'=0, ±1) would each have 1/3 probability. So the path A (m'=0) would have probability 1/3, and paths B and C (m'=±1) would each have 1/3, but the options for B and C have 1/4. That doesn't fit. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe when considering the second transition. Let's think of the total probability for each path. 

Take path A: first transition to |2,1,0⟩, then to |1,0,0⟩. 

The first step's probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element for 3→2,0→1,0→0. 

The second step from 2,1,0 to 1,0,0 would have matrix element squared proportional to some value. 

Similarly, for path B, the first step is to 2,1,1, then to 1,0,0. The second transition here would have m changing from 1 to 0, which requires Δm = -1, which is allowed. 

The probability for each path would depend on the product of the matrix elements for each step. 

The total probability would be the sum over all possible paths. But the question is asking for the transition route and the corresponding probability. So maybe each path's probability is 1/3, so answer A would have 1/3, which is option A. 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the m=0 path has a different probability because the angular part is different. 

The angular part for the first transition from m=0 to m'=0 would involve the integral of Y_{1,0} * Y_{0,0} (times some radial functions). 

---------------

Wait, the angular part of the dipole matrix element between l=0 and l'=1 with m'=0 would require that the integral of Y_{1,0} Y_{0,0} is non-zero? 



---------------

Wait, the dipole operator has components like r_x, r_y, r_z, which correspond to the spherical harmonics Y_{1, m} with m= -1,0,1. The transition matrix element for a particular m' would involve the integral of the product of the initial Y_{0,0}, the dipole component (which has Y_{1,m''}), and the final Y_{1,m'}. 

The integral over the angles would be proportional to the Wigner 3j symbol or something similar. 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the transition from m=0 to m'=0 requires that the dipole operator's m'' component is 0 (since m' - m = m'' for the operator). So for Δm=0, the operator must have m''=0. The Y_{1,0} corresponds to the z-component (like r_z), so that would contribute. 

The transition to m'=1 would require Δm=+1, so the operator component would have m''=+1 (like Y_{1,1}), and similarly for -1. 

The matrix elements for each of these components may have different magnitudes. For example, the Y_{1,0} component (dipole z) might have a different integral than the Y_{1,±1} components (x and y). 

However, in the case where the initial and final states are spherically symmetric (like l=0), the integrals for the dipole transitions in different m directions might have the same magnitude. Because the initial state is spherically symmetric, the probability for each m direction should be the same. 

Therefore, the probabilities for each of the three possible m transitions (m'=0,1,-1) would be equal. Since there are three possibilities, each would have a probability of 1/3. 

So path A (m'=0) would have a probability of 1/3, which matches option A. 

Paths B and C (m'=±1) each would also have 1/3, but the options list them as 1/4, which might not be correct. 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the second transition also has probabilities. Let's see. 

Take path A: after the first step to |2,1,0⟩, the second transition to |1,0,0⟩ requires Δl = -1 and Δm =0. The probability for this step would again depend on the matrix elements. 

Similarly, for path B, the first transition to |2,1,1⟩, then the second transition from m'=1 to 0 requires Δm = -1. 

The total probability for each path would be the product of the probabilities for each step. 

Assuming that each step's probabilities are the same (since the transitions are between similar states), then the total probabilities would be (1/3) * (1/ something). 

---------------

Wait, this is getting complicated. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simpler. Since the problem states "via two dipole transitions", and the options give possible paths with their probabilities, and the correct answer is the one that has the right path and the correct probability. 

The question might be expecting that the first transition from 3→2 must have Δl=+1 (since from l=0 to l=1). Then the second transition from 2→1 must have Δl= -1 (from l=1 to l=0). So that's allowed. 

Now, considering the possible m values, the path with m=0 in the intermediate state would have a probability that's different than the others? 



---------------

Wait, perhaps the probability given in the options is the branching ratio. For example, the total probability for all possible paths would be 3*(probability of each path's first transition) * (probability of second transition). 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the fact that when you have multiple possible paths, the total probability is split between them. Since there are three possible paths (A, B, C), each with the same probability, then each would have 1/3, so the correct answer would be option A, which has 1/3. 

Looking at the options, option A says the probability is 1/3, which matches this reasoning. 

Options B and C have 1/4, which would not add up to 1 if there are three paths. 3*(1/3)=1, but if each had 1/4, that would be 3/4. So perhaps the question considers only two paths? 

---------------

Wait, no. 

Alternatively, maybe there are more paths. For instance, the intermediate n could be higher? Like n=4? But the question specifies two dipole transitions, so going from 3→4 would require an increase in n, which would need absorption of a photon, but the problem states decay, so it must emit photons. So n must decrease each time. 

Thus, the only possible intermediate n is 2. So three paths. 

Therefore, the correct answer is A. 



---------------

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option D has the same path as A but with a probability of 2/3. But that would not fit the three paths. Unless there's another path. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the first transition can also go to n=1? Let me see. 

First transition from 3,0,0 to n=1, l=1, m=0. Then the second transition would be from n=1, l=1 to n=1, l=0? No, that can't happen because you can't have transitions within the same n? 

---------------

Wait, no, the second transition would have to go from n=1 to n=0, which is impossible. So the first transition can't go to n=1. So only n=2 is possible. 

Therefore, only three paths. So A's probability is 1/3, so the correct answer is A. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the probability is calculated considering the radial integrals, which might make some paths more probable. For example, the transition from n=3 to n=2 has a certain probability, then multiplied by the transition from n=2 to n=1. 

But without knowing the exact radial matrix elements, perhaps the question is expecting the selection rules and the fact that the m=0 path has a different probability. 



---------------

Wait, another thought. The first transition from l=0 to l=1 must have a Δl=+1, so the angular part of the matrix element for the dipole transition is proportional to sqrt( (2l+1)(2l'+1) ) * something? 



---------------

Alternatively, the total probability for the two-step process would be the sum over all possible intermediate states of the product of the probabilities for each step. 

But since the question gives specific options, perhaps the answer is A. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the fact that the m=0 path is the only one possible? But that can't be since Δm can be 0, ±1. 

Hmm, I think the key is that the question says "the transition route and the corresponding probability". The path must be one of the options, and the probability for that specific path. Since each path has 1/3 probability, option A's probability is correct. 

Thus the correct answer should be A.


The question involves the decay of the hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0⟩ state to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. Dipole transitions require Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. 

1. **First Transition**: Starting from |3,0,0⟩, the intermediate state must have l = 1 (since Δl = +1). The possible m values are 0, +1, or -1, leading to intermediate states |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩.
2. **Second Transition**: From the intermediate state, transitioning to |1,0,0⟩ requires Δl = -1 and Δm = 0, ±1. All three intermediate states can transition to |1,0,0⟩ with allowed Δm changes:
   - |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ (Δm = 0),
   - |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ (Δm = -1),
   - |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ (Δm = +1).

The probabilities for each path depend on the angular components. Since the initial state is spherically symmetric (l = 0), the probabilities for transitions to m = 0, +1, or -1 are equal. Thus, each path has an equal probability of \( \frac{1}{3} \).

**Option A** corresponds to the path |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability \( \frac{1}{3} \), which matches the reasoning. Other options either have incorrect probabilities (B and C: \( \frac{1}{4} \)) or formatting issues (D).

Answer: A
