Okay, so I have this question about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Let me try to think through this step by step. 

First, the question mentions a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, and it specifies that m (the orbital magnetic quantum number) is small. The magnetic field is 1 Tesla. They want to compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE, which has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. The options are about whether ⟨H⟩ is much less than, much greater than, equal to, or just greater than ΔE.

Hmm, paramagnetic coupling term... I remember that in the context of the hydrogen atom, the paramagnetic effect comes from the interaction between the electron's orbital motion and the magnetic field. The Hamiltonian term for that would be something like the Zeeman effect. 

---------------

Wait, the Zeeman effect is the splitting of spectral lines in a magnetic field. But the paramagnetic term might be part of that splitting. 

The Zeeman effect has two parts: the normal (or linear) Zeeman effect, which is due to the orbital angular momentum interacting with the magnetic field, and the anomalous Zeeman effect, which involves spin as well. Since the question specifies m (the orbital magnetic quantum number), maybe they are referring to the orbital part here, so the normal Zeeman effect?

The paramagnetic coupling term's expectation value ⟨H⟩ would then be the energy shift due to the magnetic field. The formula for the Zeeman effect's orbital contribution is H = μ_B * B * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. So the energy shift is proportional to m times B. 

Now, the transition energy ΔE given here is for a wavelength of 0.4861 μm. Let me calculate the energy of that transition first. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. Let me plug in the numbers. 

First, the wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 0.4861e-6 meters. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. 

Calculating E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.4861e-6). Let me compute that:

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25. Divided by 0.4861e-6 gives roughly 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 ≈ 4.09e-19 J. To convert that to electron volts, since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 4.09e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV.

Wait, but hydrogen transitions are usually in the order of electron volts. The given wavelength is 0.4861 microns? 

---------------

Wait, 0.4861 microns is 486.1 nanometers, which is in the visible range. The Balmer series has transitions ending at n=2. For example, the Balmer-alpha line is 656 nm (red), Balmer-beta is 486 nm (blue), which matches the given wavelength. So that's the H-beta line, which corresponds to a transition from n=4 to n=2? 

---------------

Wait, let me confirm the exact transitions. 

The Balmer series is transitions to n=2. The wavelengths are calculated by 1/λ = R(1/2² - 1/n²), where R is the Rydberg constant (≈1.097e7 m⁻¹). Let's check for λ=486.1 nm (which is 486.1e-9 m):

1/λ = 1/(486.1e-9) ≈ 2.057e6 m⁻¹. 

R*(1/4 -1/n²) = R*(1/4 - 1/n²) = 1.097e7*(0.25 - 1/n²) = 2.057e6? 

Let's solve for n. Let's rearrange:

0.25 - 1/n² = (2.057e6)/(1.097e7) ≈ 0.1874.

Thus, 1/n² = 0.25 - 0.1874 = 0.0626, so n² ≈ 1/0.0626 ≈ 16, so n=4. So the transition is from n=4 to n=2. 

The energy difference ΔE between n=4 and n=2 in hydrogen can also be calculated via the Rydberg formula. The energy levels of hydrogen are E_n = -13.6 eV / n². 

So ΔE between n=4 and n=2 would be E_2 - E_4 = (-13.6/4) - (-13.6/16) = (-3.4) - (-0.85) = -2.55 eV. The absolute value is 2.55 eV, which matches the earlier calculation from the wavelength. 

Now, the paramagnetic term ⟨H⟩ is the Zeeman splitting, which for the orbital part is μ_B * B * m. The Bohr magneton μ_B is approximately 9.27e-24 J/T. 

Let's compute the energy shift for a given m. Since B is 1 T, then H = μ_B * B * m. So H = 9.27e-24 J/T * 1 T * m = 9.27e-24 * m J. 

But the transition energy ΔE is about 2.55 eV. Let's convert that to Joules to compare. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 2.55 eV is 2.55 * 1.602e-19 ≈ 4.08e-19 J. 

So the paramagnetic term H is 9.27e-24 * m J. The question states that m is small. Since m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, its maximum value is l, which is n-1. For the transition from n=4 to n=2, the initial and final states have different l values, but m can range from -l to +l. However, the problem says "for small m". Let's assume m is on the order of 1 or so. 

Suppose m is 1, then H would be ~9.27e-24 J. Comparing that to ΔE of ~4e-19 J. 

The ratio of H/ΔE is (9.27e-24)/(4e-19) ≈ 2.3e-5. So H is about 2.3e-5 times ΔE. Since that's much less than 1, then H is much smaller than ΔE. 

Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy. So the correct answer would be option C. 



---------------

Wait, but let me check if I made any miscalculations here. Let me recalculate the numbers again. 

The Bohr magneton μ_B is approximately 9.27 × 10^-24 J/T. 

For B = 1 T, the energy term H = μ_B * B * m. 

If m=1, H = 9.27e-24 J. 

The transition energy ΔE is 2.55 eV, which is 4.08e-19 J. 

So H is 9.27e-24 J vs ΔE is 4.08e-19 J. 

The ratio H/ΔE = 9.27e-24 / 4.08e-19 ≈ (9.27/4.08)*1e-5 ≈ ~2.27 * 1e-5 ≈ 2.27e-5. So yes, H is about 2e-5 times ΔE. 

Therefore, H is much smaller than ΔE, so the answer should be C. 



---------------

Another point to consider: the question says "for small m". Even if m were up to say 3 (since for n=4, l can be up to 3, so m could be up to 3), then H would be 3*9.27e-24 ~2.8e-23 J, which divided by 4e-19 is ~7e-5, still way smaller than 1. 

Therefore, even with m=3, it's still much smaller. 

Thus, the correct option is C.


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of a hydrogen atom, we start by calculating ΔE using the given wavelength λ = 0.4861 µm (486.1 nm). The energy of the photon is calculated as:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s})(3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s})}{0.4861 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}} \approx 4.08 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \, \text{or} \, 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
\]

The paramagnetic coupling term due to the orbital Zeeman effect is given by:

\[
\langle H \rangle = \mu_B B m,
\]

where μ_B is the Bohr magneton (\(9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T}\)), B = 1 T, and m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. For small m (e.g., m = 1 or 2), the energy shift is:

\[
\langle H \rangle \approx (9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T})(1 \, \text{T})(m) \approx 9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J} \, \text{(for m = 1)}.
\]

Comparing the magnitudes:

\[
\frac{\langle H \rangle}{\Delta E} \approx \frac{9.27 \times 10^{-24}}{4.08 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.27 \times 10^{-5} \ll 1.
\]

Even for the maximum plausible m (e.g., m = 3), the ratio remains negligible. Thus, the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy.

Answer: C
