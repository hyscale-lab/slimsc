Okay, so I have this question about binary star systems and their masses. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is asking by what factor system 1 is more massive than system 2. The options are given, so I need to calculate the mass of each system and then find the ratio.

First, I remember that in binary systems, the orbital period and the radial velocity amplitudes are related to the masses of the stars. Oh right, Kepler's third law comes into play here. The formula that relates the masses, the orbital period, and the velocity amplitudes... I think it's something like (M1 + M2) * (a1 + a2)^3 = (4π²/G) * P², but maybe there's a simpler version when considering the radial velocity curves.



---------------

Wait, another approach: the masses of the stars can be found using the radial velocity semi-amplitude formula. The formula for each star's mass in terms of their velocities and the orbital period. Let me recall. The radial velocity amplitude of each star is proportional to their mass and inversely proportional to the total mass of the system. 

The formula for the mass of each star is something like M1 = (v1 * P * sin i) / (2π * G)^(1/3) * ... Hmm, maybe I need to use the fact that the ratio of the masses is inversely proportional to the ratio of their velocity amplitudes. Because M1/M2 = (v2/v1) * (sin i2/sin i1), but assuming that the inclination angles (i) are the same for both systems, since they both undergo eclipses, which implies that they are edge-on (so sin i =1). So maybe the inclination terms cancel out when comparing the two systems?



---------------

Alternatively, the total mass of the system can be related to the velocity amplitudes and the orbital period. Let me think of the formula for the total mass. The combined mass (M1 + M2) of a binary system can be found using the formula involving the velocity amplitudes (K1 and K2), the orbital period P, and the gravitational constant. 

The key formula here is probably the one that comes from Kepler's third law and the definition of the radial velocities. Let me recall that for a binary system, the masses can be expressed in terms of their velocities. The relation is M1/M2 = K2/K1, where K1 and K2 are the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars. So the mass ratio is inversely proportional to the velocity ratio.

But the question is about the total mass of each system. Let's see. The total mass (M_total = M1 + M2) can be found using Kepler's third law. The formula is (M1 + M2) * sin^3i = ( (4π²/G) ) * (a1 + a2)^3 / P². 

---------------

Wait, maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, using the velocity amplitudes and the period, there's a formula for the total mass.



---------------

Another approach: the radial velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 are related to the masses via K1 = (v Orbital of star 2) and K2 = (v Orbital of star 1). Since the orbital velocities are related to the masses and the separation. Let's think of the masses and velocities. The centripetal acceleration for each star is provided by the gravitational force. So for star 1, M1 * v1² / r1 = G M_total / r1². 

---------------

Wait, maybe it's better to use the formula that combines everything.

The formula for the total mass of the binary system is given by:

M_total = ( (K1 * K2 * P * (sin i)^3 ) / (2π G) )^(3/3) ? Hmm, maybe I need to look for a standard formula here. 

---------------

Alternatively, I remember that the mass function is often used in radial velocity studies. The mass function for each star is f(m) = (M * sin^3i)/( (1 + q)^2 ), where q is the mass ratio (M2/M1). But perhaps this is getting too complicated.



---------------

Wait, maybe the key is that since both systems are eclipsing binaries, the inclination is 90 degrees, so sin i = 1. So we can ignore that term. Also, the formula for the total mass can be written in terms of the velocity amplitudes and the orbital period. Let me think of the formula:

The total mass (M1 + M2) is proportional to (K1^3 + K2^3)^(something) over the period squared? Hmm, perhaps I need to consider the relation between the velocity semi-amplitudes and the masses.

Let me recall that the velocity semi-amplitude of each star is given by K1 = (2π a2)/(P) and K2 = (2π a1)/(P), where a1 and a2 are the semi-major axes of each star's orbit. Since a1 + a2 = a (the separation between the two stars), but in the case of a binary system, the semi-major axes are related to the masses. The ratio a1/a2 = M2/M1. Because the center of mass is located at a point dividing the line between the two stars in the ratio of their masses. So a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a, and a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) * a.

So, substituting into K1 and K2:

K1 = (2π a2)/P = (2π ( (M1/(M1 + M2)) * a )) / P

Similarly, K2 = (2π a1)/P = (2π ( (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a )) / P

So the ratio K1/K2 = (a2/a1) = (M1/M2). Which gives M1/M2 = K1/K2. So that's the mass ratio.

But how do we get the total mass?



---------------

Alternatively, the total mass can be found using Kepler's third law. The formula is:

(M1 + M2) = ( (a1 + a2)^3 * (2π / P)^2 ) / (G) ) ?



---------------

Wait, Kepler's third law in the form (M1 + M2) = (4π² / (G P²)) * (a)^3, where a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. But a here is the separation between the two stars. Since a1 + a2 = a, where a1 and a2 are the semi-major axes of each star's orbit around the center of mass. 

So, if I can express a in terms of the velocities. Let's see:

We have K1 = (2π a2)/P and K2 = (2π a1)/P. Since a1 + a2 = a, then a = (a1 + a2).

Also, since a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a, and a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) * a. 

So, substituting into K1 and K2:

K1 = 2π/(P) * (M1/(M1 + M2)) * a 

Similarly, K2 = 2π/(P) * (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a 

Therefore, if we take K1 * K2 = (2π/(P))^2 * (M1 M2)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ) * a² 

Hmm, but perhaps we can find (M1 + M2) in terms of K1 and K2 and P?

Let me think of the total mass formula again. Let me recall that the formula for the total mass in terms of the velocity amplitudes and period is given by:

(M1 + M2) = ( (K1^3 + K2^3) * P^2 ) / (2 G π^2 )^(something) ?



---------------

Wait, maybe I should approach it using Kepler's third law directly. Let's consider the formula:

The orbital period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed divided by the total mass. The exact formula is:

P² = (4 π² / G (M1 + M2)) * a³ 

So rearranged, (M1 + M2) = (4 π² a³ )/( G P² )

But we need to express a in terms of the velocities. Let's see, from the expressions for K1 and K2.



---------------

Alternatively, let's find expressions for a1 and a2 in terms of K1 and K2.

From above, K1 = (2 π a2)/(P). So a2 = (K1 P)/(2 π). Similarly, a1 = (K2 P)/(2 π). Therefore, the total separation a = a1 + a2 = (K1 + K2) P/(2 π).

Substitute that into the Kepler's third law equation:

(M1 + M2) = (4 π² a³ )/( G P² )

Plugging in a = (K1 + K2) P/(2 π):

(M1 + M2) = (4 π² ) / (G P² ) * [ ( (K1 + K2) P / (2 π) )^3 ]

Let me compute this step by step:

First, a³ = [ (K1 + K2) P/(2π) ]^3 

Multiply by 4 π² / (G P²):

4 π² / (G P²) * [ (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π^3) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

4 π² * (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 / (8 π^3 G P² )

The P terms: P^3 / P^2 = P

The π terms: π² / π^3 = 1/π

So overall:

(4 / 8) * (K1 + K2)^3 * P / ( G π )

Simplify 4/8 to 1/2:

So ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 G π )



---------------

Wait, but that seems a bit complicated. Let me check again.

Wait, let me recalculate:

The a³ term is [(K1 + K2) P/(2π)]^3 = (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 / (8 π^3 )

Multiply by 4 π² / (G P²):

So the total becomes:

4 π² * (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 / (8 π^3 G P² )

The P^3 / P^2 is P^1.

The π² / π^3 is 1/π.

So 4/(8) = 0.5, so:

( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 π G )

Hmm, so:

M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2 π G )



---------------

Wait, but that formula seems to have units? Let me check the units. K is in km/s, which is m/s. P is in years, but we need to convert to seconds. Hmm, maybe this approach is getting too tangled. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way.

Alternatively, maybe the mass is proportional to (K1^3 + K2^3) * P^something. 

---------------

Wait, but perhaps I should use the relation that the total mass is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 * P over something. 

---------------

Alternatively, since I might be overcomplicating, maybe there's a simpler way using the fact that the mass is proportional to (K1^3 + K2^3) * P^something. 



---------------

Alternatively, since both systems are eclipsing, we can assume that sin i =1, so the inclination factor is accounted for. Let me think of the mass function. 

---------------

Wait, the mass function for a binary star is f(m) = (M sin^3 i)/( (1 + q)^2 ), where q is the mass ratio. But maybe since we have both velocity amplitudes, we can get the total mass.



---------------

Alternatively, let me think of the formula for the total mass in terms of the velocity amplitudes and the period. Let me see if there's a formula that can be derived from the equations.

We have K1 = (2π a2)/P, so a2 = (K1 P)/(2π). Similarly, a1 = (K2 P)/(2π). Since a1 + a2 = a, the separation between the stars.

From Kepler's third law, (M1 + M2) = (4 π² a³)/(G P² )

Substituting a = a1 + a2 = (K1 + K2) P/(2π):

So,

M_total = (4 π² / (G P² )) * [ ( (K1 + K2) P/(2 π) )^3 ]

Let me compute that:

Expand the cube: ( (K1+K2)^3 P^3 ) / ( 8 π^3 )

Multiply by 4 π² / (G P² ):

So,

4 π² * (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 / (8 π^3 G P² ) 

Simplify terms:

4/(8) = 1/2

P^3/P^2 = P

π² / π^3 = 1/π

Thus,

( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 π G )

Hmm, so the formula is M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2 π G )

But to find the mass, we need to plug in the constants, but maybe since we are comparing the two systems, the constants will cancel out when taking the ratio.

So let's denote for system 1 and system 2:

M1_total = ( (K1a + K1b)^3 * P1 ) / (2 π G )

M2_total = ( (K2a + K2b)^3 * P2 ) / (2 π G )

Therefore, the ratio M1_total / M2_total = [ (K1a + K1b)^3 * P1 ] / [ (K2a + K2b)^3 * P2 ]

Because the denominators (2π G) cancel out.

So now plug in the given values.

For system 1: the RV amplitudes are 10 and 5 km/s. So K1a =10, K1b=5. So their sum is 15 km/s.

The period P1 is 2 years.

For system 2: RV amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s. Sum is 25 km/s. Period P2 is 1 year.

So plugging into the ratio:

( (15)^3 * 2 ) / ( (25)^3 * 1 )

Let me compute that.

First, 15^3 = 3375; 25^3 = 15625

So numerator: 3375 * 2 = 6750

Denominator: 15625 * 1 = 15625

So the ratio is 6750 / 15625.

Let me compute that division:

6750 divided by 15625.

Well, let's see:

15625 × 0.4 = 6250

6750 - 6250 = 500

So 0.4 + (500/15625) = 0.4 + 0.032 = 0.432.



---------------

Wait, 500/15625 = (500 ÷ 25)/(15625 ÷25) = 20 / 625 = 0.032.

So total ratio is 0.432, approximately 0.43.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.4. Option B is ~0.6. The answer would be closest to 0.4, so option A?



---------------

Wait, but let me check my steps again. Did I mix up the systems?

Wait, the question is asking "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So the ratio M1/M2 is 0.43, so system1 is 0.43 times as massive as system2, which would mean system1 is less massive. But the options include 0.4 as A, so that's possible. But let me check again.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait the formula was:

M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2 π G )

So the ratio M1/M2 = [ (K1_sum)^3 * P1 ] / [ (K2_sum)^3 * P2 ]

Yes, that's correct. So with the numbers:

K1_sum for system1: 10+5=15, system2:15+10=25.

So (15/25)^3 * (2/1) = ( (3/5)^3 ) *2.

Compute (3/5)^3 = 27/125 ≈0.216. Multiply by 2 gives ~0.432. So indeed ~0.43, which is closest to option A, 0.4.



---------------

But wait, the options are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, etc. So the answer would be A?



---------------

Wait, but maybe I inverted the ratio?

Wait, the question is "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So if M1 is 0.43 times M2, then system1 is 0.43 times as massive as system2, so system2 is more massive. But the question is asking how much more massive system1 is than system2. So that would be a factor less than 1, but the answer would be 0.43, which is option A.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider that the mass is proportional to (K1^3 + K2^3) * P? Or perhaps the formula is different.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the individual velocity amplitudes and mass ratios.

Wait, let's try another method. Since the mass ratio is M1/M2 = K2/K1 (since K1 is proportional to M2 and K2 proportional to M1). Let's see.

In system1, the two stars have velocities 10 and 5. So the mass ratio M1/M2 = (5)/(10) = 0.5. So M1 =0.5 M2. So the total mass of system1 is M1 + M2 = 1.5 M2. 

---------------

Wait, but then how do I get the total mass in terms of the period and velocities?

Alternatively, let's denote for system1:

Let the masses be M1 and M2 (same as the system's stars). Their velocity amplitudes are K1 =10 and K2=5. The mass ratio M1/M2 = K2/K1 = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 =0.5 M2. Total mass M_total1 = M1 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

Similarly, for system2, the masses are m1 and m2, with K1=15 and K2=10. So mass ratio m1/m2 =10/15 = 2/3. So m1 = (2/3)m2. Total mass m_total2 = m1 + m2 = (5/3)m2.

Now, to find the total masses, we need to relate them to the orbital period. Let's use Kepler's third law for each system.

For system1:

(M_total1) * a^3 = (4π²/G) P1²

Similarly for system2:

(M_total2) * a^3 = (4π²/G) P2²



---------------

Wait, but the separation a is different for each system. So unless we can relate the separations, this might not help. 

---------------

Alternatively, using the velocity amplitudes.

We can relate the velocity amplitudes to the masses and the orbital period. Let's recall that the velocity amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2 π a)/(P) * (M_other / M_total)



---------------

Wait, for star1, its velocity is v1 = (2π a1)/P. Since a1 is the semi-major axis of star1's orbit around the center of mass. And a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a_total, where a_total is the separation between the stars.

So v1 = 2π/(P) * (M2/(M_total)) * a_total.

But the total separation a_total = a1 + a2 = (M2/(M_total))a_total + (M1/(M_total))a_total = a_total.

Hmm, 

---------------

perhaps another way. Let's write the velocity amplitude K1 (for star1) as:

K1 = (2 π a1)/P = (2 π/(P)) * ( (M2/(M_total)) * a_total )

But a_total is the separation between the stars, which is a1 + a2. But also, from Kepler's third law, a_total^3 = (G M_total P²)/(4 π²).

So substituting a_total = [ (G M_total P²)/(4 π²) ]^(1/3)

Hmm, substituting into K1:

K1 = (2 π / P) * ( M2/(M_total) ) * [ (G M_total P²)/(4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify:

Let me write this step by step:

Let me denote a_total = [ (G M_total P²)/(4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

Thus,

K1 = (2 π / P) * (M2 / M_total) * a_total 

Substituting a_total:

K1 = (2 π / P) * (M2 / M_total) * [ (G M_total P²)/(4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

Let me simplify the terms inside:

Let me compute the exponents. Let's first compute the term [ (G M_total P²)/(4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

Let me write all terms:

Multiply (2 π / P) with the a_total term:

So:

K1 = (2 π / P) * (M2 / M_total) * [ (G M_total P² ) / (4 π²) ]^{1/3}

Let me break this down:

First, let's compute the constants:

The constants inside the cube root:

The term inside the cube root is (G M_total P²)/(4 π²).

Let me handle each part step by step. Let's compute the entire expression:

Let me write all terms multiplied together:

The constants:

2 π / P multiplied by [ (G M_total P²)/(4 π²) ]^{1/3}

Let me separate the terms with M_total, P, and constants.

First, let's handle the M_total terms:

The M_total in the numerator from (M2/M_total) and the cube root term's M_total^(1/3):

So overall, M_total terms: (M2 / M_total) * (M_total)^{1/3} = M2 * M_total^{-2/3}

The P terms:

P in the denominator from (2π/P) and the cube root term has P² inside, so when taken to the 1/3, that's P^(2/3). So overall P terms: (1/P) * P^(2/3) = P^{-1 + 2/3} = P^{-1/3}

The G term: G^{1/3}

The π terms: 2 π from the first term, and (4 π²)^{-1/3} from the cube root:

2 π * (4 π²)^{-1/3} 

Let me compute that:

2 / (4^{1/3}) ) * π / (π^{2/3}) ) 

4^{1/3} is 2^(2/3), so 2 / 2^(2/3) = 2^{1 - 2/3} = 2^(1/3)

Similarly, π / π^{2/3} = π^{1 - 2/3} = π^{1/3}

Thus, the constants become 2^(1/3) * π^{1/3}

Putting all together:

K1 = [ 2^(1/3) * π^{1/3} ] * [ G^{1/3} ] * [ M2 * M_total^{-2/3} ] * [ P^{-1/3} ]

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me see if I can rearrange terms to solve for M_total.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that the product K1 * K2 is related to the masses and period. Let's see:

We have K1 = (2 π a2)/(P) and K2 = (2 π a1)/(P). The product K1*K2 = (4 π² a1 a2)/P².

But a1 * a2 = (M1/(M_total)) a_total * (M2/(M_total)) a_total = (M1 M2)/(M_total²) * a_total².

Hmm, not sure.



---------------

Alternatively, let me try to find an expression for M_total in terms of K1, K2, and P.

From the previous formula where M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P )/(2 π G )



---------------

Wait, but if that's the case, then the ratio would be as I calculated before, 0.43. So the answer is A?



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the formula derivation.

Wait let me check with another approach. Let's consider the formula for the mass of a binary system in terms of the velocity amplitudes. 

The formula for the total mass is given by:

M_total = ( (K1^3 + K2^3) * P^2 ) / ( (2 π G)^{something} ) ?



---------------

Wait, perhaps I need to refer to the standard formula for the mass of a binary system. 

The formula I found in some references: The total mass of the binary system is given by:

M_total = ( (K1^3 + K2^3) * P^2 ) / ( (2 π G)^{-1} * a^something ) )

Hmm, 

---------------

perhaps another way. Let me recall that in a binary system, the radial velocity semi-amplitudes are related to the masses and the orbital period. 



---------------

Alternatively, let me consider that the mass is proportional to (K^3 * P), where K is the velocity amplitude, but that might be in a different context. 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for each star's mass.

For each star, the mass is given by:

M1 = (K2 * P^2 * (a_total)^3 ) / (2 π G * something )

Hmm, not helpful.



---------------

Wait, let me think of the two stars in system1. Let me assign variables:

Let M1 and M2 be the masses of the two stars in system1. Their velocities are K1 =10 and K2=5. The period is 2 years.

The mass ratio is M1/M2 = K2/K1 = 5/10 = 0.5 ⇒ M1 = 0.5 M2.

Total mass M_total1 = M1 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

Similarly, for system2, the masses are m1 and m2 with K1=15 and K2=10. So m1/m2 = 10/15 = 2/3 ⇒ m1 = (2/3)m2. Total mass M_total2 = m1 + m2 = (5/3)m2.

Now, to find the total masses, we need to relate them to the orbital periods. 

Using Kepler's third law for each system:

For system1:

(M_total1) * a^3 = (4 π² / G) * P1² 

Similarly for system2:

(M_total2) * a'^3 = (4 π² / G) * P2² 

Where a and a' are the semi-major axes of the orbits (the separation between the stars in each system).

But we need to relate the separations a and a' to the velocity amplitudes. 

We can find the separation a in terms of the velocity and mass. Let me think of the velocity amplitude for star1 in system1:

K1 = (2 π a2)/P1, where a2 is the semi-major axis of star2's orbit. 

But a2 = (M1/(M_total1)) * a_total (since a_total = a1 + a2, and the center of mass divides the distance in the ratio of the masses).



---------------

Wait, a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) * a_total. 

Similarly, a1 = (M2/(M_total1)) * a_total.

Thus, K1 = (2 π / P1) * a2 = (2 π / P1) * (M1/(M_total1)) * a_total.

But M1 = 0.5 M2, so M_total1 = 1.5 M2. Thus, M1/(M_total1) = (0.5 M2)/(1.5 M2) = 1/3.

Therefore, K1 = (2 π / P1) * (1/3) * a_total.

Similarly, K2 = (2 π / P1) * (M2/(M_total1)) * a_total = (2 π / P1)*( (M2)/(1.5 M2) ) * a_total = (2 π / P1)*(2/3) *a_total.

Given that K1 is 10 km/s and K2 is 5 km/s, so indeed 1/3 * a_total * (2π/P1) = 10, and 2/3 * a_total * (2π/P1) = 5. Which checks out because the ratio K2/K1 = (2/3)/(1/3) = 2, but wait, K2 is 5 and K1 is 10, so ratio is 0.5. 

---------------

Wait that contradicts. Wait wait, no.

Wait K2 is the velocity of star2, which is 5 km/s. K1 is star1's velocity, which is 10. So K2/K1 =0.5. Which matches the mass ratio M1/M2 =0.5. So that's correct.

So, from K1 = (2 π / P1) * (M1 / M_total1) * a_total

We can solve for a_total:

a_total = (K1 * P1 * M_total1 )/( 2 π M1 )

Substituting M1 = 0.5 M2, M_total1 =1.5 M2:

a_total = (10 km/s * 2 years * 1.5 M2 )/( 2 π * 0.5 M2 )

The M2 terms cancel out. 



---------------

Wait, but the units here are mixed (km/s and years). Hmm, perhaps this is getting too involved. But since we are taking the ratio between the two systems, maybe the actual numerical values of G and the unit conversions will cancel out.



---------------

Alternatively, let's plug a_total into Kepler's third law for system1:

M_total1 * a_total^3 = (4 π² / G) * P1²

We can solve for M_total1:

M_total1 = (4 π² / G) * P1² / a_total^3 

But from the expression for a_total:

a_total = (K1 * P1 * M_total1 )/( 2 π M1 )

So substituting into a_total^3:

a_total^3 = [ (K1 P1 M_total1)/(2 π M1) ]^3 

Thus, substituting into M_total1 equation:

M_total1 = (4 π² / G) * P1² / [ (K1 P1 M_total1 / (2 π M1 ))^3 ]

Multiply both sides by denominator:

M_total1 * (K1^3 P1^3 M_total1^3 / (2 π M1)^3 ) ) = (4 π² / G) P1² 

Hmm, getting very tangled. Maybe this approach isn't the best.

Perhaps going back to the initial approach with the ratio is better.

The key formula I derived earlier was:

M_total1 / M_total2 = [ (K1a + K1b)^3 * P1 ] / [ (K2a + K2b)^3 * P2 ]

Plugging the numbers:

(15^3 * 2 ) / (25^3 * 1 )

15^3 is 3375, 25^3 is 15625. So 3375*2 = 6750 divided by 15625 gives 0.432, which is approximately 0.4. So the answer should be A) ~0.4.



---------------

Wait but let me check if the formula was correct. Let me think again of the formula for the total mass.

The formula I had was:

M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2 π G )

Is that correct?



---------------

Wait let me re-derive it quickly.

We had:

From Kepler's third law: M_total = (4 π² a³)/( G P² )

And a = a1 + a2 = (K1 P)/(2 π) + (K2 P)/(2 π) ) = P/(2 π) (K1 + K2 )

So a = (K1 + K2) P/(2 π )

So a³ = (K1 + K2)^3 P³/( 8 π³ )

Plugging into M_total:

M_total = (4 π² / G P² ) * [ (K1+K2)^3 P³/(8 π^3) ) ]

Multiply terms:

4 π² * (K1+K2)^3 P³ / (8 π³ G P² )

Simplify:

4/(8) = 0.5

P³ / P² = P

π² / π³ = 1/π

Thus, M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 π G )

Yes, that's correct. So the formula is correct.

Therefore, the ratio is indeed (15^3 *2)/(25^3 *1) = (3375*2)/(15625) = 6750/15625 = 0.432, which is approximately 0.4. So answer A.

But wait, the options are A ~0.4, B ~0.6. So the answer must be A.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the velocity addition? Let me check the given data again.

The question says for system1, the RV amplitudes are 10 and 5. So sum is 15. System2 has 15 and 10, so sum is 25. That's correct. Periods are 2 and 1. So the calculation is correct. 

Hmm. So I think the correct answer is A.


The problem requires calculating the mass ratio between two binary star systems using their orbital periods and radial velocity amplitudes. For system_1, the radial velocities are 10 km/s and 5 km/s, summing to 15 km/s, with a period of 2 years. For system_2, the velocities are 15 km/s and 10 km/s, summing to 25 km/s, with a period of 1 year. 

The total mass of a binary system is given by \( M_{\text{total}} \propto \frac{(K_1 + K_2)^3 \cdot P}{\text{constant}} \). The ratio of the masses of system_1 to system_2 is:

\[
\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{(15)^3 \cdot 2}{(25)^3 \cdot 1} = \frac{3375 \cdot 2}{15625} = \frac{6750}{15625} \approx 0.432
\]

This value is closest to option A (~0.4). 

Answer: A
