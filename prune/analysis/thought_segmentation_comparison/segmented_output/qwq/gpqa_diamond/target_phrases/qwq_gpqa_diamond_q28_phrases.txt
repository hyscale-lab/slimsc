Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the problem is about finding which mutation in the gene would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley. The gene has five exons and four introns. The mutants have changes in the first exon. We need to look at the sequences of each mutant and see which one would most likely stop the production of the compound.

First, I remember that mutations can be different types: missense, nonsense, silent. A nonsense mutation introduces a premature stop codon, which truncates the protein early, possibly making it non-functional. That might be what we want here because if the protein is truncated, maybe the compound isn't made.

Looking at the original gene sequence starting with ATG (start codon) and ending with TGA (stop). The mutants have changes in the first exon. Let me compare each mutant's sequence to the original.

Original first part: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: The 7th nucleotide (from the start) is TTT vs. TCT in the mutant? 

---------------

Wait, let me look again. Let me write them out aligned.

Original starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT...
Mutant 1: ATG T TCT AC GCT... Hmm, wait. Let me parse the sequences properly. Let's break down the first few nucleotides step by step.

Original: The first part is "ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT..."
Let me write the first 20 or so nucleotides to compare.

Original: positions 1-20 (assuming the start is position 1):
1-3: ATG (start)
4-6: TTT
7-9: CTC
10-12: GCT
13-15: GGT
16-18: ACT
19-21: TCT etc.

Now, looking at Mutant 1's sequence:
Mutant1: 5’-ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’


---------------

Wait, maybe I should compare each nucleotide. Let me see:

Original starts as:
Positions 1-20:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...



---------------

Wait, let me write each nucleotide position by position. Let's see:

Original first exon starts with:
Position 1: A
2: T
3: G (start codon)
Then next few:
4: T
5: T
6: T (so positions 4-6: TTT)
Then position 7: C (so next triplet after the start is TTT (positions4-6), then next triplet starting at 7 is CTC (positions7-9: C T C? 

---------------

Wait, maybe better to list each nucleotide step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to look at the differences in the mutants. Let's look at each mutant's sequence and see where the mutation is.

Mutant 1: The original is ATGTTTCTCGCT... The mutant's sequence starts as ATGTTTCTACGCT... 

---------------

Wait, let me compare the sequences:

Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...
Mutant1: ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...


---------------

Wait, looking at the first part, let's see where the difference is.

Original starts: ATGTTTCTC (positions up to the 9th nucleotide)
Mutant1: ATGTTTCTA (positions up to 9th? 

---------------

Wait, maybe the first difference is at position 7? Let me check each position step by step.

Original:
1: A
2: T
3: G
4: T
5: T
6: T
7: C
8: T
9: C
10: G
11: C
12: T
13: G
14: G
15: T
16: A
17: C
18: T
19: T
20: C etc.



---------------

Wait, maybe I should write the original and mutant1 sequences side by side for the first part where they differ. Let's see:

Original: 5'-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...
Mutant1: 5'-ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

Looking at the first part up to where they start to differ. Let's compare the first 15 or so nucleotides.

Original first part:
ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T...



---------------

Wait, perhaps better to compare character by character:

Original: A T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T...

Mutant1: A T G T T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G C...



---------------

Wait, the first difference between original and mutant1 is at position 8? Let me see:

Looking at the first 10 nucleotides:

Original first 10:
Positions 1-10: A T G T T T C T C G (since position 7 is C (position7), then T (8?), let me see:



---------------

Wait, let me count again. Let's write each position:

Original sequence starts as:

1: A
2: T
3: G
4: T
5: T
6: T
7: C
8: T
9: C
10: G
11: C
12: T
13: G
14: G
15: T
16: A
17: C
18: T
19: T
20: C
21: T
22: G
23: T
24: G
25: G
26: A
27: T
28: G
29: A
30: A
31: C
32: A
33: T
34: A
35: T
36: T
37: T
38: A
39: T
40: T
41: G
42: T
43: C
44: G
45: T
... etc.

Now, Mutant 1's sequence: 

Looking at the first part:

Mutant1 starts with ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

So, let's parse each position:

Mutant1 first 10 nucleotides:

1: A
2: T
3: G
4: T
5: T
6: T
7: C
8: T
9: A (here's the first difference! Original at position9 is C, mutant1 has A here?)


---------------

Wait, let me check again. Let me write the mutant1's first part:

Original: ... after ATG (positions1-3), the next part is TTT (positions4-6), then CTC (positions7-9: C T C?), but in mutant1, after the first 6 nucleotides (positions1-6: ATGTTT), then next is CTA (positions7-9: C T A?), so the 9th position in mutant1 is A instead of C?



---------------

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me parse the mutant sequences again.

Original sequence (first part):

Original's first exon starts with:

5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Breaking down each nucleotide step by step:

Positions 1-12:

1: A
2: T
3: G
4: T
5: T
6: T (positions 4-6: TTT)
7: C
8: T
9: C (positions7-9: CTC)
10: G
11: C
12: T (positions10-12: GCT)
So, the 9th nucleotide is C (original).

Mutant1's sequence: The first part is ATGTTTCTACGCT...

Breaking down:

Positions 1-12:

1: A
2: T
3: G
4: T
5: T
6: T (same as original up to here)
7: C
8: T
9: A (difference here! Original is C here)
10: C
11: G
12: C (positions 10-12: CGC? 

---------------

Wait, let's see:

Wait, after position9 (which is A in mutant1), then position10 would be C, 11 G, 12 T? 

---------------

Wait, maybe I should check:

Mutant1's first part: "ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC..."

So after the first 9 nucleotides (positions1-9):

Positions 1-9 of mutant1 are: A T G T T T C T A (so position9 is A, whereas original was C here).

Then the next nucleotides (positions10-12):

Position10: C (from "CTACGCT..." so after A at position9 comes C at 10?), then G, then C? Let me see:

The sequence after position9 (A) would be C G C T... so positions10-12 would be C, G, C? Because "CTACGCT" — after the A at position9 comes C (position10?), then G (position11), then C (position12?), forming the triplet from position10-12 as CGC?

So, the mutation in Mutant1 is at position9: Original is C, mutant1 is A. So the change is C→A at that position.

Now, let's see what that does to the codons. Since exons are coding regions, each triplet is a codon. Let's see the codons around this area.

Original sequence up to that point:

The first few codons after the start (ATG):

Start codon (positions1-3: ATG)

Next codons:

Positions4-6: TTT (codon)
Positions7-9: CTC (codon)
Positions10-12: GCT (next codon)
etc.

So the mutation in Mutant1 is in position9, which is the third base of the CTC codon (positions7-9). The original codon is CTC (which is Leu? 

---------------

Wait, CTC is Leucine (Leu) in the genetic code. Wait, CTC is Leu (UAA is stop, but CTC is Leu). 

In Mutant1, position9 is A, so the codon becomes CTA (since positions7-9 are C T A). What's CTA? Let's check the codon table: CTA is Leucine (CTN is Leu except CTA is actually Leu? 

---------------

Wait, no. Wait, CTA is Leucine? Let me think. The codons for Leucine are CTT, CTC, CTA, CTG. So yes, CTA is also Leucine. So changing the third base from C to A in CTC to CTA would still code for Leucine. So that's a silent mutation here. So no change in the amino acid. So Mutant1's mutation doesn't affect the protein's amino acid sequence here. So that's not going to eliminate the compound.

Now, moving on to Mutant2:

Mutant2's sequence is 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Original starts with ATGTTTCTC... so comparing to Mutant2:

Original first part up to the mutation area:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT... 

Mutant2: ATG TT CTA AGC TGG... 

So let's parse the nucleotides here. Let's see where the difference is.

Looking at the first part:

Original: positions 1-6: ATGTTT (positions 4-6 TTT), then positions7-9 CTC, etc.

Mutant2's sequence: 

The first part is ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

Breaking down:

Positions1-6:

Original: positions4-6: T T T (so the 4th to 6th are TTT)
Mutant2's first 6: 

Positions1-6: A T G T T C (so the 6th position is C instead of T?)



---------------

Wait, maybe better to go step by step:

Mutant2's first part:

Positions1-3: A T G (same as original)
4: T
5: T
6: C (original was T here). So position6 is C in mutant2 instead of T.



---------------

Wait, let me parse:

Original sequence up to position6: positions4-6 are T T T (so the 4th,5th,6th are T's).

Mutant2's sequence up to position6:

Position4: T (same), position5: T (same?), position6: C (so the sixth nucleotide is C instead of T. So the first difference here is at position6: T to C.



---------------

Wait, maybe I need to look again. Let me write the first part of Mutant2's sequence:

Mutant2 starts with "ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC..."

Breaking down each position:

Positions 1-6:

1: A
2: T
3: G
4: T
5: T
6: C (so here's the first difference: original at position6 is T, mutant2 has C here)
Then position7: T (original had C at 7? Let me see.

Original's first 6 nucleotides after the start (positions4-6 are TTT). So position6 is T (original), but mutant2 has C here. So the change is at position6: T→C.

Now, let's see the codons around this area. The first codon after the start (positions4-6) in the original is TTT (which is Phenylalanine, Phe). In mutant2, the codon would be TTC (since position6 is C). TTC is also Phe. So that's still the same amino acid. So that's a silent mutation here.

Then the next codon: positions7-9. Original was CTC (Leu), but in mutant2, let's see:

After position6 (C), the next nucleotides would be T (position7?), then A (position8?), then A (position9?), leading to a new codon.



---------------

Wait, let me do this step by step.

In mutant2, after the first 6 nucleotides (positions1-6):

Positions7-9 would be:

Position7: T (original was C here? 

---------------

Wait, original's position7 is C (from original's CTC codon at positions7-9). 

Wait, let me look at the exact sequence of Mutant2:

Mutant2's first part is "ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC..."

Breaking down the first 12 positions:

Positions1-3: ATG (start)
4-6: T T C (so T T C? 

---------------

Wait, no, positions4-6 are T (4), T (5), C (6). So the first codon after the start is TTT (positions4-6 in original) but in mutant2, the first codon (positions4-6) is TTC (still Phe).

Then the next codon is positions7-9:

In mutant2, after position6 (C), the next nucleotides:

Position7: T (since the sequence after TTC is TAA... so positions7-9 would be T A A (from "CTAAGC..." — wait, the next part is "CTAAGCT..." so after the initial part, maybe I'm getting confused.



---------------

Wait, let me parse the sequence again step by step for Mutant2:

Starting from the beginning:

Mutant2's sequence: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Breaking down each position:

1: A
2: T
3: G (start codon)
4: T
5: T
6: C (so codon positions4-6: TTC (still Phe))
Then positions7-9:

Position7: T (the next nucleotide after the 6th is T at position7)
Position8: A (from the sequence "CTAAGCT..." — wait, after the first 6 positions (ATGTTCT?), the next letters would be AAG? Let me see:



---------------

Wait, the first part after the start is "ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACT..." So after the first 6 (positions1-6: ATG T T C), then the next letters are "TAAGCT..." 

So position7: T (from "CTAAGCT..."? 

---------------

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the letters. Let's parse the letters correctly:

Original sequence after ATG: TTTCTCGCT...
Mutant2 has after ATG: TTCTAAGCT...

So after the start (positions1-3: ATG), the next letters are:

positions4: T, 5: T, 6: C (making TTC), then 7: T, 8: A, 9: A (so positions7-9: TAA).

So the codon at positions7-9 in mutant2 is TAA, which is a stop codon. 

---------------

Wait, that's a big deal!

Wait, so in the original gene, positions7-9 are CTC (Leu), but in mutant2, positions7-9 are TAA (stop). 

So that's a nonsense mutation. The codon CTC (Leu) becomes TAA (stop). So this introduces a premature stop codon early in the gene. That would truncate the protein, potentially making it non-functional. If the gene product is necessary for the anti-nutritional compound, then a premature stop early would prevent the protein from being made, thus eliminating the compound. That's exactly what we want here. 

So Mutant2's mutation causes a premature stop codon, which would likely stop the protein synthesis early, so the enzyme might not be produced, so the compound isn't made. That's a good candidate.

Now, check the other mutants to be sure.

Mutant3: 

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Comparing to original. Let's see where the difference is.

Original starts with ATGTTTCTC..., mutant3 starts with ATGTTTTACGCT...



---------------

Wait, let's parse the first part:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT...
Mutant3: ATG TTTT ACG CTG...

Hmm, so maybe the first difference is here. Let me check position by position.

Original first nucleotides (positions1-12):

1: A, 2:T,3:G, 4:T,5:T,6:T (positions4-6 TTT), 7:C,8:T,9:C (CTC), 10:G,11:C,12:T (GCT).

Mutant3's first part is "ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…"

Breaking down:

Positions1-3: same (ATG)
4: T,5:T,6:T (same as original so far)
7: T (original was C here). So position7 is T instead of C.



---------------

Wait, let's go step by step:

Mutant3's sequence after ATG is TTTTACGCT... So positions4-7:

Positions4-7: T T T T (so positions4-7 are T's up to position7? Let me see:

Positions4: T (same as original)
5: T (same)
6: T (same as original)
7: T (original was C here)
So position7 is a mutation: C→T.

Then position8: A (since the next letters are AC... so after T at 7, the next is A at 8, then C at9? So positions7-9 would be TAC (since positions7: T,8:A,9:C).

Original at positions7-9 were CTC (Leu), mutant3 has TAC (which is Tyr).

So that's a missense mutation, changing Leu to Tyr. That might alter the protein's function but may not eliminate it entirely. The protein might still be partially functional, so the compound could still be made. So this mutation might not be the best choice.

Also, looking further, mutant3 has a longer sequence. Let me check if there's any frameshift. 

---------------

Wait, the question says the gene has exons and introns, but the mutations are in the first exon. Since the mutation is in the first exon (which is coding), the mutation is in the coding sequence. The mutation here is a single nucleotide change (C→T at position7), so no frameshift, just a missense. So the protein would be altered but not truncated. So this might not stop the compound production.

Mutant4:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Looking at the sequence: 

Original starts with ATGTTTCTC... Mutant4's sequence is ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTG...

Comparing the first part:

Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...
Mutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

So the first difference is at position7 again? Let me parse the first nucleotides:

Original first part up to position12: 

positions4-6 TTT (positions4-6), then 7:C,8:T,9:C (CTC), then 10:G,11:C,12:T (GCT).

Mutant4's sequence after ATG is TTTTACGCTACTTCT... 

Breaking down:

Positions4-7: T T T T (so position7 is T instead of C (original had C at 7)).

Then position8: A, position9:C, position10: T, etc. 

So positions7-9 in mutant4 would be TAC (since 7=T,8=A,9=C). That's the same as mutant3's first mutation. 

---------------

Wait, but maybe there are other changes?

Looking further, maybe after that:

Original after position9: the next codon (positions10-12) was GCT (Ala), but in mutant4, let's see:

Positions10-12 would be positions10: A (from the sequence "ACTTCT..." after the initial part?), so perhaps mutant4 has a different sequence here. Let me check:

The sequence after the first part:

Mutant4's sequence after ATGTTTTACGCT... would have the next nucleotides as ACTTCT...



---------------

Wait, the exact sequence is:

Mutant4's first part is "ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…"

So after the first 9 nucleotides (positions1-9):

Positions10: A (since the next letters are ACTTCT...). 

So positions10-12 would be ACT (since positions10: A, 11:C, 12:T). So the codon here would be ACT (which is Thr), whereas original was GCT (Ala). So another missense.

Additionally, looking further, maybe there's a deletion or insertion? 

---------------

Wait, the length of the sequence may have changed? Let me check the length.

The original sequence ends with "...TGA-3’" and mutant4's sequence ends similarly. The question states that the mutations are in the first exon area, so perhaps the length is the same? The problem might not involve frameshifts here, but let me see.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe there's a deletion. Looking at mutant4's sequence:

Original's first exon includes "GGTACTTCTGTGGAT..." but in mutant4, after the initial changes, the sequence is "ACTTCTGTGGAT..." which may have a missing G? Let me count:

Original after the first part up to position12: ... GCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant4 has after the first part: ...GCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Ah, perhaps there's a deletion? Let me see:

Original: After the first 12 positions (GCT), the next is GGT (positions13-15). In mutant4's sequence, after GCT (positions1-?), then the next part is ACT, so maybe positions13-15 are ACT instead of GGT? That would mean a substitution. 

---------------

Alternatively, maybe a deletion of a nucleotide?

Alternatively, maybe in mutant4's sequence, after the first TAC (positions7-9), the next part is ACTTCT..., which might mean that there's a deletion of a nucleotide leading to a frameshift. 

---------------

Wait, let me check the exact sequence.

Wait, the original has after position12 (GCT):

positions13-15: GGT (from "GGTACTTCTGTGGAT..."), so the next codon is GGT (Gly). 

In mutant4's sequence, after the first part, it's "ACTTCT..." which would be positions13-15 as ACT (if the sequence is continuing without a shift). So that's a substitution of GGT to ACT (Gly to Thr). So that's another missense mutation, but not a frameshift. 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation causes a frameshift. Let me see:

Wait, the first mutation in mutant4 is at position7 (C→T), which is a single nucleotide substitution, so no frameshift. The rest are also substitutions. So the entire coding sequence is still in frame. 

So in mutant4, the first codon after the start (positions4-6: TTT) remains the same (since position6 is T in mutant4?), wait, original position6 is T, mutant4's position6 is T (since the first 6 are ATGTTTT? 

---------------

Wait, the first part of mutant4 is "ATGTTTTAC...", so positions4-6 would be T T T (since the 4th is T, 5th T, 6th T?), so that's TTT (same as original). Then position7 is T instead of C (mutation here). So the first codon after the start is TTT (same as original), then the next codons are altered.

So, the mutations in mutant4 introduce several missense changes but no premature stop codon. So the protein would still be made, just altered. Therefore, the compound might still be present, just maybe in a different form or not, but the question wants to eliminate it, so this might not work.

Now, looking back to Mutant2, which introduces a premature stop codon (TAA) at position7-9 (changing CTC to TAA). That would truncate the protein early, likely making it non-functional. Since the gene is responsible for the anti-nutritional compound, disrupting the gene's product would eliminate the compound. 

Mutant3 and 4 have missense mutations that might not completely stop the protein's function. Mutant1 has a silent mutation. So the best option is Mutant2 (Option A).



---------------

Wait, but let me check if there are any other possible mutations leading to a stop codon.

Wait, in Mutant3, let's see further along. The sequence of Mutant3 is "ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’". The original had "GGTACTTCTG...", so mutant3 has "GTGTCACTTCTG..." — perhaps there's another stop codon introduced later? Let me see.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in analyzing mutant4. Let me check again.

Wait, the question says the gene has five exons and four introns. Since the mutations are in the first exon, which is part of the coding region, any mutation there could affect the protein.

In mutant4's sequence, the original gene has the first exon starting with ATGTTTCTC... and mutant4's sequence is ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTG... 



---------------

Wait, perhaps there is a deletion of a nucleotide? Let me see the exact letters again. The original sequence after the first few bases is "CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT..." 

Mutant4's sequence is "TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT..." 

Looking at the part after "TTTTACGCTA...", perhaps the "GGT" part is missing. For example, in the original, after "GCT" (positions10-12), it's followed by GGT (positions13-15). In mutant4, after "GCTA" (positions?), maybe there's a deletion causing a frameshift?



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key is that Mutant2 introduces a stop codon early, which is likely to eliminate the protein function. The other mutants don't do that. So the answer is Mutant2 (A).


To determine which mutation eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the mutations in the first exon of the gene. The goal is to find a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, likely by introducing a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) or a critical missense mutation.

**Mutant 1**:  
The mutation changes position 9 from **C** to **A**, altering the codon from **CTC** (Leucine) to **CTA** (still Leucine). This is a **silent mutation**, leaving the protein unchanged. Thus, it does not eliminate the compound.

**Mutant 2**:  
The mutation changes position 6 from **T** to **C**, altering the second codon from **TTT** (Phenylalanine) to **TTC** (still Phenylalanine), which is silent. However, the next codon (positions 7-9) changes from **CTC** (Leucine) to **TAA**, a **stop codon**. This introduces a premature termination, truncating the protein early. This is likely to abolish the protein's function, eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.

**Mutant 3**:  
The mutation changes position 7 from **C** to **T**, altering the codon from **CTC** (Leucine) to **TTC** (Phenylalanine). This is a **missense mutation**, changing an amino acid but not truncating the protein. The protein may retain partial function, so the compound might still form.

**Mutant 4**:  
The mutation changes position 7 from **C** to **T**, altering the codon from **CTC** (Leucine) to **TAC** (Tyrosine), another **missense mutation**. Subsequent substitutions further alter the protein but do not introduce a premature stop. The protein remains functional, so the compound may still be produced.

**Conclusion**: Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon, which is the most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound by truncating the protein early.

Answer: A
