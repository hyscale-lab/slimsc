Okay, let's see. The question is about finding which mutation in the gene would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley. The gene has five exons and four introns, and we're looking at the first exon. The problem is that the current cultivar produces this bad compound, so we need to find a mutation that stops the gene from working. The options are four different mutants, each with a change in the beginning of the first exon.

First, I need to recall that mutations can be of different types. Since they used EMS, which is ethyl methanesulfonate, a mutagen that typically causes point mutations (like base substitutions), so each mutant probably has a single nucleotide change, but maybe more? 

---------------

Wait, the sequences here show more than just one change. Let me look at each mutant's sequence compared to the intact gene.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Let me compare each mutant's sequence to the original.

Starting with Mutant 1: The sequence given is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA.

Comparing to the original:

Original first part: ATGTTTCTCGCTG...

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTG...



---------------

Wait, let me write them out aligned:

Original: ATGTTT CTCGCTG...
Mutant1: ATGTT C TACGCTG...

Hmm, maybe I should break it down base by base. Let's see:

Original: Let me write the first part in segments:

Original starts with:

Positions 1-3: ATG (start codon), then TTT (positions 4-6), then CTC (7-9), GCT (10-12), GGT (13-15), etc. 

---------------

Wait, perhaps writing the sequences with their nucleotide positions would help.

Wait, maybe I should look for the exact differences. Let me write the original and each mutant line by line.

Original first exon's sequence (starting at 5' end):

5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1's sequence:

5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Let me align them:

Original: A T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T...
Mutant1: A T G T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G C...



---------------

Wait, let's compare each nucleotide step by step from the start. Let's see:

Starting from the first base (position 1):

Original: A (pos1), T (2), G (3), T (4), T (5), T (6), C (7), T (8), C (9), G (10), C (11), T (12), G (13), G (14), T (15), A (16), C (17), T (18), T (19), C (20), T (21), G (22), T (23), G (24), G (25), A (26), T (27), G (28), A (29), A (30), C (31), A (32), T (33), A (34), T (35), T (36), T (37), A (38), T (39), T (40), G (41), T (42), C (43), G (44), T (45)...

Mutant1: A (1), T (2), G (3), T (4), T (5), C (6?), 

---------------

Wait let me check again. Wait, perhaps the first mutation is at position 6?

Wait maybe I should write them as strings:

Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Breaking down the first part:

The first few bases after ATG (start codon):

Original: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GA...



---------------

Wait, let's see the exact sequences:

Original sequence up to where the mutants differ:

Original first part:

After the start codon (ATG), the next nucleotides are TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...



---------------

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look at where the mutations occur.

Looking at Mutant 1: the first change is at the 6th position? Let me see:

Original: positions 1-24:

Positions 1-6: ATGTTT (so the first 6 bases are ATGTTT)

Mutant1's first 6 bases would be ATGTT? 

---------------

Wait, let me check:

Wait the original is ATGTTT (positions 1-6: A T G T T T)

Mutant1's sequence starts with ATGTTCTACG... Hmm. Let's see:

Original: A T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T...

Mutant1's sequence: A T G T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G C...



---------------

Wait, so comparing the original and mutant1:

Original: ATGTTTCTC... (so the 7th base is C (position7), then T (position8) etc.

Mutant1's sequence after ATG is T T C T A C G... 

---------------

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me parse the mutant sequences more carefully.

Original sequence starts with:

ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT

Mutant1's sequence is:

ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC

Comparing the first parts:

Original: ATGTTTCTC... (positions 1-12: A T G T T T C T C G C T...)

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCT... So let's see each base:

Positions 1-5: A T G T T (same as original up to position5). Position6: Original has T, mutant1 has C? 

---------------

Wait, original's position6 is the sixth T (since the first 6 are ATGTTT). So position6 is T in original. Mutant1's position6 is C? Let me count:

Original: 1: A, 2:T,3:G,4:T,5:T,6:T,7:C,8:T,9:C,10:G,11:C,12:T,...

Mutant1: first letters:

Positions 1-5: A T G T T (same as original up to position5). Position6: C (since the next letters after ATGTT are T in original and C in mutant1). So position6 is T vs C here. Then position7: in original was C (position7), but mutant1's next is T (since after ATGTT C comes next? 

---------------

Wait let me write the mutant1's first part again.

Wait the mutant1's sequence is written as:

ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

Breaking it down:

After ATG (positions 1-3), the next letters are T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T... 

---------------

Wait, perhaps the mutation here is a substitution at position6 (changing T to C?), and then another substitution?

Wait maybe I should compare each position step by step.

Original first 12 bases:

1:A, 2:T,3:G,4:T,5:T,6:T,7:C,8:T,9:C,10:G,11:C,12:T.

Mutant1's first 12 bases:

1:A,2:T,3:G,4:T,5:T,6:C,7:T,8:A,9:C,10:G,11:C,12:T?



---------------

Wait that might not be right. Let me see:

Looking at the mutant1's sequence: after ATG (positions1-3), the next letters are T T C (positions4-6: T, T, C?), but original at positions4-6 are T, T, T (positions4: T, 5: T,6:T). 

---------------

Wait, maybe I messed up the order. Let me write the mutant1's sequence as per the given string.

The original is:

Original: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant1 is:

5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So, the first part after ATG (positions 1-3) is:

Original: TTTCTC (positions4-9: T T T C T C)

Mutant1: TTCTAC (positions4-9: T T C T A C )

So, comparing:

Position4: T (same)

Position5: T (same)

Position6: Original T vs Mutant1 C (so position6: T to C?)

Position7: Original C vs Mutant1 T (position7: C vs T)

Position8: Original T vs Mutant1 A (position8: T vs A)

Position9: Original C vs Mutant1 C (same here)



---------------

Wait, so between original and mutant1, positions6,7,8 are different. So multiple substitutions here?

Wait that's a problem. Because EMS typically induces point mutations (single base changes), but here the mutant1 has multiple changes in a row. Hmm, maybe the question's presentation is such that each mutant has a single change but the way the sequences are written might have a typo? 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the mutations are insertions or deletions? Wait, looking at the length:

Original's first part: Let's count the letters up to where the difference occurs.

Original's first part up to the first exon's start: Let me see. The first exon is the first exon, so the sequence given is the start. Let me count the letters in the mutant sequences to see if there's a frameshift or deletion.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the mutations are presented as a few nucleotide changes, but the question states that they sequenced the gene and found changes in the first exon area. So perhaps each mutant has a different mutation, some substitutions, maybe a frameshift?

The question asks which mutation would eliminate the compound. To eliminate the compound, we need to stop the gene's function. So the best way is to have a mutation that introduces a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation), or disrupts the start codon, or causes a frameshift leading to a truncated protein.



---------------

Alternatively, a mutation that creates a stop codon early would be ideal. Let's look at each mutant's changes.

Let me go through each mutant one by one.

Mutant1:

Looking at the sequence changes. Let's see the first part. The first exon starts with ATG (start codon) followed by TTTCTC... The mutant1's sequence after ATG is T T C T A C G C T... So positions 4-9 (after the start codon):

Original: positions 4-9: T T T C T C (bases 4-9 are T, T, T, C, T, C).

Mutant1: T T C T A C (so positions4-6: T T C; position6 is C instead of T (position6). Then position7 is T (original was C?), wait no:



---------------

Wait let me get the exact letters again.

Original: positions 1-9 (after ATG):

Position1 (start codon is positions1-3: ATG). The first exon's first few nucleotides after the start codon (positions4 onwards):

Original:

4: T

5: T

6: T

7: C

8: T

9: C

Mutant1's sequence at these positions:

Position4: T (same)

5: T (same)

6: C (changed from T to C)

7: T (changed from C to T)

8: A (changed from T to A)

9: C (same as original)

So in mutant1, there are substitutions at positions6 (T→C), 7 (C→T), and 8 (T→A). So three base changes in a row here. That might be a stretch for a single EMS mutation, but maybe the question allows for multiple mutations? The problem states that they "discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area." So each mutant has some changes, possibly multiple. The question is which one would eliminate the compound.

Now, looking for which mutation would disrupt the gene's function. Let's see each mutant's possible effect.

Mutant1: The first exon's first codons. The start codon is ATG (positions1-3). The next codons are:

Original:

After ATG (codon 1), the next codons would be:

Codon 2: positions4-6: TTT (leucine)

Codon3: positions7-9: CTC (leucine)

Codon4: positions10-12: GCT (alanine)

And so on.

Mutant1's sequence after the start codon:

Codon2: positions4-6: T T C → TTC (phenylalanine)

Codon3: positions7-9: T A C → TAC (tyrosine)



---------------

Wait, let's see:

Mutant1's codons after the start:

Codon2 (positions4-6): T T C → TTC (F)

Codon3 (positions7-9): T A C → TAC (T is position7, A is8, C is9 → TAC is tyrosine (TAC is Y))

So the first three codons are ATG, TTC, TAC. So that's a change from the original TTT (Leu) to TTC (still Leu? 

---------------

Wait no, TTT is Phe, wait wait, wait: TTT is phenylalanine (F), not leucine. 

---------------

Wait I think I made a mistake here.

Wait, codon TTT is phenylalanine (F), TCT is serine, etc. Let me correct that.

Original codons:

After ATG (start):

Codon2: positions4-6: TTT → F (phenylalanine)

Codon3: positions7-9: CTC → Leucine (CTC is L)

Codon4: positions10-12: GCT → Alanine (A)

So mutant1's codons:

Codon2: T T C (positions4-6: TTC → also phenylalanine (F), same as original. 

---------------

Wait, TTT and TTC are both F. So codon2 remains F.

Codon3: positions7-9: T (7), A (8), C (9) → TAC, which is tyrosine (Y). Originally it was CTC (L). So changing from L to Y.

Codon4: positions10-12: GCT (original) → since the mutant's next bases after position9 are GCT, so positions10-12 would be G C T → same as original, so codon4 is still A.

So in mutant1, the change is in codon3 from L to Y, and codon2 is unchanged (since TTC is still F). So this would result in an amino acid change (L to Y) but not necessarily a premature stop. So the protein would still be made, but with a different amino acid. That might reduce the function but not eliminate it. So this might not be the best option.

Moving to Mutant2:

Mutant2's sequence: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Original first part: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Comparing:

Original after ATG: TTTCTC GCTGGT...

Mutant2's sequence after ATG: TTCTAA GCTGGT...

So let's break down the differences:

Looking at positions4-12:

Original:

4:T,5:T,6:T,7:C,8:T,9:C,10:G,11:C,12:T

Mutant2:

4:T,5:T,C: T (position6?), then the next part: TAA GCT...



---------------

Wait let me parse the sequence properly.

Mutant2's first part:

After ATG (positions1-3), the next letters are T T C T A A G C T G G T A C T T...

So positions4-12:

Position4: T (same as original)

Position5: T (same)

Position6: C (original T here → so position6 is changed from T to C?)



---------------

Wait, let me write it step by step:

Original:

Positions1-12: A T G T T T C T C G C T (positions4-12 are TTTCTC GCT → T (pos4), T(pos5), T(pos6), C(pos7), T(pos8), C(pos9), G(pos10), C(pos11), T(pos12).

Mutant2's first 12 bases after ATG:

Positions4-12:

T T C T A A G C T → so:

Position4: T (same)

5: T (same)

6: C (changed from T to C in original's position6?)



---------------

Wait original's position6 is T (since original's first 6 bases after ATG are TTT (positions4-6 are T, T, T)), so position6 is T. In mutant2, position6 is C. So substitution at position6 (T→C). Then position7: T (original was C here?), no, original's position7 is C (since original's position7 is the 7th base after ATG, which is C (the first C in CTCGCT...). 

---------------

Wait this is getting confusing. Let me see:

Wait, the original sequence after ATG is TTTCTC GCTGGT... So positions4-6 are TTT (positions4-6: T, T, T). Then positions7-9: CTC (C, T, C). Then positions10-12: GCT (G, C, T). 

Mutant2's sequence after ATG is TTCTAAGCTGGT... So positions4-12:

positions4-6: T T C (so position6 is C instead of T)

position7: T (originally C at position7?)



---------------

Wait, let's parse each base:

Mutant2's first 12 nucleotides after ATG:

Positions4-12:

4: T

5: T

6: C (changed from T)

7: T (original was C here?)



---------------

Wait original's position7 was C (since original's 7th position after ATG is the first C in CTC...). So mutant2 has a T here. So position7: T instead of C.

position8: A (original was T at position8?)

Original's position8 is the second T in CTC (positions7-9: CTC → positions7:C, 8:T, 9:C). So mutant2's position8 is A instead of T.

position9: A (original's position9 was C). So T at position9?



---------------

Wait, let's count each position step by step for mutant2:

After ATG (positions 1-3):

Position4: T (same as original)

Position5: T (same)

Position6: C (original was T)

Position7: T (original was C)

Position8: A (original was T)

Position9: A (original was C)

Position10: G (original was G)

Position11: C (original was C)

Position12: T (original was T)



---------------

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here, perhaps I should look at the codons.

Original codons after start:

Codon2 (positions4-6): TTT (F)

Codon3 (7-9): CTC (L)

Codon4 (10-12): GCT (A)

Mutant2's codons:

Codon2: positions4-6: T T C → TTC (still F)

Codon3: positions7-9: T (position7), A (8), A (9) → TAA. Oh! TAA is a stop codon. So in codon3, instead of CTC (L), it's TAA (stop). 

Ah! So this would introduce a premature stop codon right there. Because TAA is a stop. So the protein would be truncated after the second codon (F), instead of continuing. So this mutation would result in a non-functional protein, which would prevent the anti-nutritional compound from being made. That sounds promising.

So Mutant2 has a stop codon early, which would likely eliminate the compound. Let me check the other options to be sure.

Mutant3:

Sequence: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Original's first part after ATG is TTTCTC GCTGGT...

Mutant3's sequence after ATG: TTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT...

Looking at the first part:

Original starts with TTTCTC (positions4-9: TTTCTC).

Mutant3's sequence after ATG: T T T T A C G C T G G T...



---------------

Wait, let me parse this. 

Original's first 12 bases after ATG:

positions4-12: T T T C T C G C T (so positions4-6: TTT, 7-9: CTC, 10-12: GCT).

Mutant3's first 12 bases after ATG:

positions4-12: T T T T A C G C T (so positions4-7: T T T T, then A C G C T...)



---------------

Wait, so:

Position4: T (same)

5: T (same)

6: T (same as original's position6)

7: T (original was C here (position7))

So position7 changed from C to T.

Position8: A (original was T (position8))

Position9: C (original was C here (position9))



---------------

Wait, let's see codons:

Codon2 (positions4-6): TTT (F, same as original)

Codon3: positions7-9: T (position7), A (position8), C (position9) → TAC (Y). 

Original codon3 was CTC (L). So changing to TAC (Y) here.

Codon4: positions10-12: GCT (A, same as original).

So mutant3 has a change in codon3 from L to Y. Similar to mutant1, but in a different way. This would be a missense mutation, altering the amino acid but not causing a stop. So the protein would still be produced, possibly with reduced function, but maybe not enough to stop the compound.



---------------

Wait, but looking further into the sequence of mutant3, the given sequence shows "GTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT..." which may have other changes. 

---------------

Wait the full sequence provided for mutant3 is:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’



---------------

Wait, original after the first part was "GGTACTTCTGTGGATGAAC..." So in mutant3, after the initial changes, there's a GTGTCA... which might indicate an insertion or a frameshift?



---------------

Wait, maybe I should check if there's a frameshift. Let me see:

Looking at the sequence after codon4 (position10-12: GCT (A)), then original's next codon would be positions13-15: GGT (G). 

Mutant3's sequence after that: 

After GCT (positions10-12), the next bases are G T G T C A C T T C T G T G G A T...



---------------

Wait, let me check positions13-15: in original, positions13-15: GGT (G). In mutant3, positions13-15: G T G → G (still G). But then the next part: the sequence has GTGTCA..., so maybe there's an insertion here? Let me see the exact letters.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe there's a deletion or insertion causing a frameshift. Wait the mutant3's sequence after the first part is:

After ATGTTTTACGCTGGT (positions up to 15?), then GTCACTTCTGTGGAT...

Hmm, perhaps there's a duplication or a deletion. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps a frameshift occurs because of an insertion or deletion of nucleotides. Wait, but all the given mutations are substitutions? The question mentions EMS, which typically causes point mutations (single base substitutions). But looking at mutant3's sequence:

Original sequence after the start's first part:

Original: ...GCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant3's sequence: ...GCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Looking at the part after GCTGGT:

Original: ACTTCTGTGGATGAAC...

Mutant3: GTCACTTCTGTGGATGAAC...



---------------

Wait, so after GCTGGT (positions10-15?), the original has ACT, and mutant3 has GTCA... So maybe there's an extra G or T inserted here, causing a frameshift? Let me count the bases.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps a deletion or insertion. For example, if there's a deletion of a base here, leading to a frameshift. Let me see:

Original: After GCTGGT (positions10-15: GCT GGT), then positions16-18: ACT (A), then TCT (S), etc.

In mutant3: After GCTGGT, the next is GTCA... which might be GTC A CT... So maybe an extra base inserted here? Like between the G and T, inserting a T? Not sure. 

---------------

Alternatively, maybe a deletion. 

Alternatively, maybe the mutation is a substitution leading to a frameshift? Wait, if in the first part, there was a substitution that causes a frameshift. 

---------------

Wait, but in the first few codons, mutant3's codons up to codon4 are still in frame. The first three codons are:

ATG (start), TTT (F), TAC (Y), GCT (A). So codons are still in frame. The issue comes after. 

---------------

Wait, maybe there's a frameshift later on. Let me see further in the sequence.

But the problem states that the mutations are at the beginning of the gene's sequence in the first exon area. So perhaps the key is in the first few codons. Since mutant3's first few codons have a missense mutation (L to Y in codon3), but not a stop, it might not eliminate the compound.

Now looking at Mutant4:

Sequence:5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Comparing to original:

Original after ATG: TTTCTC GCTGGT...

Mutant4's sequence after ATG: TTTTAC GCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Let me break it down:

Original first part after ATG:

positions4-12: T T T C T C G C T (codons TTT, CTC, GCT)

Mutant4's first part after ATG:

positions4-12: T T T T A C G C T A C T... 

---------------

Wait, let's parse step by step.

Wait the mutant4's sequence is written as:

ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So after ATG, the sequence is TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Breaking down the first few bases:

Positions4-6: T T T (same as original's first three positions here (positions4-6: TTT))

Position7: T (original was C at position7)

Position8: A (original was T at position8)

Position9: C (original was C at position9)

Position10: G (original's position10 was G, so same)

Position11: C (original's position11 was C)

Position12: T (original's position12 was T)



---------------

Wait, let me check codons:

Codon2 (positions4-6): TTT (F, same as original)

Codon3: positions7-9: T (position7), A (8), C (9) → TAC (Y, like mutant2 and 3)

Codon4: positions10-12: GCT (A, same as original)

So the first three codons are:

ATG (start), F (TTT), Y (TAC), A (GCT). So similar to mutant2 and 3, this is a missense mutation in codon3. But no stop codon here. 

But looking further, after codon4 (GCT), the next part in mutant4's sequence is ACTTCTGTGGAT... 

Original's sequence after GCT (codon4) was GGT (codon5) then ACTTCTGTGGAT...



---------------

Wait, original's codon5 (positions13-15): GGT (Gly). 

Mutant4's sequence after GCT (positions10-12: GCT) has next codons:

positions13-15: ACT (position13: A,14:C,15:T → ACT is threonine (T)) 

Original had GGT there. So codon5 is changed from G to T. 

So the mutation in codon5 would also be a missense. But again, not a stop.

However, maybe there's a frameshift here? Let me see. 



---------------

Wait, in mutant4's sequence after the first exon's start, let's see the entire first part:

Mutant4's sequence after the first few codons is "TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT..."



---------------

Wait, perhaps there's a deletion here. Let's see:

Original sequence after the first codons:

After the start codon (positions1-3), the next is TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So the sequence after GCT (positions10-12: GCT) is GGT (positions13-15), then ACT (positions16-18), TCT (positions19-21), etc.

Mutant4's sequence after GCT (positions10-12: GCT) is ACT (positions13-15?), because the next letters are ACTTCTGTGGAT...



---------------

Wait, so in the original, after GCT (positions10-12) comes GGT (positions13-15). In mutant4, after GCT comes ACT (positions13-15: A, C, T). So there's a substitution here (GGT → ACT), but the reading frame remains intact. So no frameshift here. 

Hmm, so mutant4's codons up to there are still in frame, but with some amino acid changes. Not a stop codon. 

Looking for a mutation that introduces a stop codon early would be the best option. Mutant2 has a stop codon in codon3 (TAA). That would truncate the protein early, so the gene product is non-functional, thus eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. 

Mutant1 and 3 and 4 have missense mutations but no stop. 



---------------

Wait, but what about frameshift mutations? For example, if there was a deletion or insertion causing a frameshift, leading to a premature stop. Let me check if any of the mutants have such a thing. 

Looking at mutant3's sequence: the given sequence shows "GTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT..." after some point. Let me see if there's an insertion or deletion causing a frameshift. For example, if there's an extra nucleotide, shifting the reading frame. 

Suppose in mutant3's sequence, after the first few codons, there's an insertion of a base. For instance, if there's an extra base inserted at position13, then the codons after that would shift. But the problem states that the mutations are in the first exon area, so maybe the key is in the initial part. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe mutant4 has a deletion. Looking at the sequence:

Original after ATGTTTTACGCTGGTACTT... 

---------------

Wait, perhaps I should look for a frameshift in the beginning. 

Wait, let me look again at mutant3's first part. The original has TTTCTC (positions4-9), and mutant3 has TTTTAC (positions4-9: T T T T A C). That's 6 bases, so no frameshift. 

Mutant2 has TAA in codon3, which is a stop. That's the best option. 

So the answer is Mutant2 (Option A). 



---------------

Wait the options are:

A) Mutant2

B) Mutant3

C) Mutant1

D) Mutant4

Yes, so the correct answer is A.


To determine which mutation eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we need a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, such as introducing a premature stop codon. Analyzing each mutant's sequence:

- **Mutant1** has substitutions in codons 2, 3, and 8, altering amino acids but not introducing a stop codon. This results in a missense mutation but not a loss of function.
- **Mutant2** introduces a **TAA stop codon** in codon 3 (positions 7-9: TAA). This premature stop truncates the protein early, rendering it non-functional, which would eliminate the compound.
- **Mutant3** and **Mutant4** also have missense mutations but no stop codons. They alter amino acids but do not disrupt the gene's activity sufficiently.

The most effective mutation is **Mutant2**, as it introduces a premature stop codon, halting protein synthesis early and likely eliminating the compound.
