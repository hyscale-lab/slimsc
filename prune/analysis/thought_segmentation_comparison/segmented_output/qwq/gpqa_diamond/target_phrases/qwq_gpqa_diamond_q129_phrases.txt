Okay, let's see. The question is about estimating the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds so they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes using the Lyman alpha wavelength. Hmm, I need to remember how redshift and wavelength relate here.

First, Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. But ground-based optical telescopes can't observe ultraviolet because of the Earth's atmosphere absorbing that. So the key here is that the wavelength observed must be in the visible range for the telescope to detect it. 



---------------

Wait, the clouds are absorbing the light from quasars. The absorption occurs at the rest wavelength of hydrogen's Lyman alpha, which is 1216 Å. But since the clouds are moving away from us (due to the expansion of the universe), their wavelength is redshifted. The observed wavelength would be lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + z), where z is the redshift. 

The telescope can only detect this if the observed wavelength is in the optical range. The optical window for ground telescopes is roughly 4000 to 7000 Angstroms? Or maybe up to 1 micron (10,000 Å?), but the atmosphere blocks a lot beyond certain points. 

---------------

Wait, the atmosphere is mostly transparent in the visible from about 400 nm (4000 Å) to 700 nm (7000 Å). So the detected wavelength must be above 4000 Å to get through the atmosphere. 

So, the absorption line's observed wavelength must be at least 4000 Å. Let me set up the equation: 

lambda_obs = 1216 Å * (1 + z) >= 4000 Å 

Solving for z: 

1 + z >= 4000 / 1216 

Calculating 4000 divided by 1216. Let me do that. Let's see, 1216 times 3 is 3648, so 4000-3648 is 352. 352/1216 is roughly 0.29. So total would be 3.29? 

---------------

Wait wait, wait. Let me compute 4000 divided by 1216 more accurately. 

1216 × 3 = 3648. Subtract that from 4000: 4000 - 3648 = 352. 

So 352 / 1216 = 0.289. So total is 3 + 0.289 ≈ 3.289. 

So 1 + z ≈ 3.289 → z ≈ 2.289. 

Hmm, so the lower limit would be approximately 2.29. Let me check the options. The options given are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. 



---------------

Wait, 2.289 is close to 2.4, which is option C. But wait, perhaps the optical window starts lower? Let me confirm the exact cutoff. 



---------------

Wait, maybe the optical window is up to about 1 micron (10,000 Å) but the atmosphere starts blocking beyond 700 nm (7000 Å). So to be safe, the minimum observed wavelength for detection must be above 4000 Å. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the lower end of the optical window. Wait, the problem says "lower limit on the redshift" so that they can be detected. So the minimal z where the observed wavelength is just within the optical range. 



---------------

Wait, if the observed wavelength has to be above 4000 Å (the lower end of visible?), then 1216*(1+z) ≥ 4000 → z ≥ (4000/1216)-1 ≈ 2.289. So that would be approximately 2.3. The closest option is C, 2.4. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the atmosphere's cutoff is different. Let me think again. The Earth's atmosphere blocks most UV below ~300 nm (3000 Å), but the visible starts at about 400 nm (4000 Å). So the Lyman alpha at 1216 Å is way below that. So to see the absorption, the redshift must push the wavelength into the visible. 



---------------

Wait, but the absorption line's observed wavelength must be in the optical. So the minimum redshift needed is when the observed wavelength is at the lower edge of the optical (4000 Å). Therefore, the calculation is correct. So z ≈ 2.289. 

Looking at the options, the closest is C)2.4. So the answer should be C. 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recompute 4000 divided by 1216. Let's compute 1216 × 3.28 = ?



---------------

Wait, 1216 × 3 = 3648. 1216 × 0.28 = ?

0.2 ×1216=243.2, 0.08 ×1216=97.28 → total 243.2+97.28=340.48. So 3648 + 340.48 = 3988.48. Hmm, that's 1216 × 3.28 ≈ 3988.48, which is just under 4000. So to reach exactly 4000, need a bit more than 3.28. So 3.28 gives 3988, so adding 12 more Angstroms. 

Each 0.01 of z would be 1216 × 0.01 = 12.16. So 0.01 more gives about 12.16. So 3.28 + 0.01 gives 3.29, which would be 3988.48 +12.16 =4000.64. So z is 2.29. 

Therefore, the lower limit is approximately 2.29. The options are 2.4 (C) and 1.9 (D). 2.29 is closer to 2.4. So the answer must be C. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the question considers the upper end? Wait, no. The question asks for the lower limit on redshift. That is, the smallest redshift that allows the absorption to be in the optical. So if the redshift were lower than that, the wavelength would be in the UV and undetectable. So the minimal z required is ~2.29, so any z above that is detectable. Therefore the lower limit is that value. So the options given have 2.4 as the closest, so the answer is C.


To determine the lower limit on the redshift \( z \) of neutral hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman-alpha absorption (at rest wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \) Å) can be detected with optical telescopes, we must ensure the observed wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) falls within the optical window (≈4000–7000 Å). The observed wavelength is given by \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \times (1 + z) \). To be detectable, \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) must exceed the lower limit of the optical window (4000 Å):

\[
1216 \, \text{Å} \times (1 + z) \geq 4000 \, \text{Å}.
\]

Solving for \( z \):

\[
1 + z \geq \frac{4000}{1216} \approx 3.29 \quad \Rightarrow \quad z \geq 2.29.
\]

The closest option to \( 2.29 \) is **C) 2.4**.
