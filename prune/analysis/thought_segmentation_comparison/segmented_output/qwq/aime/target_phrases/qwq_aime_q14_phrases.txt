Okay, so I need to figure out the number of paths on an 8x8 grid from the lower left corner to the upper right corner that have a length of 16 and change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me start by recalling some basics about grid paths.

First, in an 8x8 grid, moving from the lower left (let's say that's (0,0)) to the upper right (which would be (8,8)), you have to make a total of 8 moves to the right (R) and 8 moves up (U), right? Since each path is made up of 16 steps, that makes sense. Now, the problem is about paths that change direction exactly four times. 



---------------

Wait, changing direction exactly four times. So, each time the direction changes, that's when you switch from moving right to up or vice versa. For example, a path that goes all the way right then all the way up would have only one direction change. Similarly, a path that alternates every step would have 15 direction changes, which is the maximum. 

So, to have exactly four direction changes, the path must consist of runs of rights and ups, alternating, with a total of five runs (since each direction change adds a new run). For example, if you start with right, then up, then right, then up, then right—that would be four direction changes and five runs. 

---------------

Wait, actually, the number of runs is equal to the number of direction changes plus one. So, if there are four direction changes, there are five runs. 

Therefore, the path must be composed of five segments, alternating between horizontal and vertical movements. Since we start at the lower left, the first move can be either right or up. 

---------------

Wait, actually, since we're going from (0,0) to (8,8), the first step has to be either right or up. But depending on the starting direction, the number of runs might differ. Hmm, actually, no—if you have five runs, the starting direction can be either R or U, so there are two cases: starting with R or starting with U. 



---------------

Wait, but since the path has to end at (8,8), if you start with R, then the last run must be U, and if you start with U, the last run must be R. Because you need to end at the upper right corner, so the final direction has to be the opposite of the starting direction if the number of runs is odd. 

---------------

Wait, since five runs is odd, so if you start with R, you end with R? Wait, no, let me think again.

Let me clarify. Suppose the path starts with a run of right moves, then alternates. So, starting with R, then U, then R, then U, then R. That's five runs. The last run is R. But to get to (8,8), the total number of R's must be 8 and U's must be 8. So, if the last run is R, then the total R's would be the sum of the first, third, and fifth runs. Similarly, the U's would be the second and fourth runs. So, the total R's would be R1 + R3 + R5 =8, and U's would be U2 + U4 =8. Similarly, if the path starts with U, then the runs would be U, R, U, R, U, ending with U, so the total U's would be U1 + U3 + U5 =8 and R's would be R2 + R4=8.

Therefore, the starting direction can be either R or U, but in each case, the number of runs in each direction must add up to 8. So, we have two cases: starting with R or starting with U. Since the problem doesn't specify starting direction, we have to consider both possibilities and add them together.

Therefore, the total number of paths is equal to the number of paths starting with R and having five runs (four direction changes) plus the number starting with U and having five runs. Since the grid is symmetric, these two numbers should be equal, so maybe we can compute one and double it?



---------------

Wait, let me check that. Suppose starting with R: the runs are R, U, R, U, R. The total R's must be R1 + R3 + R5 =8, and U's must be U2 + U4 =8. Similarly for starting with U: U1 + U3 + U5 =8 and R2 + R4 =8. Since the equations are symmetric, the number of ways should be the same. So yes, we can compute one case and multiply by two.

Therefore, let's compute for starting with R first. Let me formalize this.

Case 1: Starting with R.

We have five runs: R1, U2, R3, U4, R5.

Each R segment (R1, R3, R5) must be at least 1, and each U segment (U2, U4) must be at least 1. Because you can't have a run of zero in between; otherwise, that would mean you didn't change direction there. Since direction changes occur when you switch between R and U, each run must have at least one step.

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of solutions to:

R1 + R3 + R5 =8, with each Ri ≥1,

and

U2 + U4 =8, with each Ui ≥1.

Similarly, for the U starting case, it would be the same but with the roles of R and U reversed.

So, for the R starting case, the number of solutions for the R segments is the number of ways to write 8 as the sum of three positive integers. That's C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2). Similarly, the U segments are two positive integers summing to 8, which is C(8-1,2-1)=C(7,1).

Therefore, the total number for starting with R is C(7,2)*C(7,1). Similarly, starting with U is the same: the R segments would be two variables (since if starting with U, there are two R runs) so C(7,1)*C(7,2). Therefore, total is 2*C(7,2)*C(7,1). 

---------------

Wait, let me verify.

Wait, actually, for starting with R:

The R segments are three variables (R1, R3, R5) each at least 1, so the number of solutions is C(8-1,3-1)=C(7,2). The U segments are two variables (U2, U4) each at least 1, so C(8-1,2-1)=C(7,1). Multiply these together gives the number of ways for starting with R.

Similarly, starting with U, the U segments are three variables (U1, U3, U5) each at least 1, so C(7,2), and the R segments are two variables (R2, R4), so C(7,1). Thus, same product. Hence total is 2 * C(7,2)*C(7,1).

Calculating that: C(7,2) is 21, C(7,1)=7. So 21*7=147, multiplied by 2 gives 294. Hmm, so would the answer be 294?



---------------

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the direction changes are exactly four. Each run alternates direction, so with five runs, there are four direction changes. So the logic is correct. Each run must be at least one step. So the number of compositions.

Yes, the number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts (for R) is C(7,2), and into 2 parts for U is C(7,1). So that's correct.

Therefore, 21*7=147 for each starting direction, so total 294. 

---------------

But wait, let me check if there's an error here. Let me think of a smaller grid to test.

Suppose a 2x2 grid. So, moving from (0,0) to (2,2). The total steps needed are 4 (2R and 2U). Let's see how many paths change direction exactly twice. Since direction changes are exactly two, so number of runs is 3. Let's see.

Possible paths with two direction changes:

Starting with R: R, U, R. But that would be R1, U2, R3. The total R is R1 + R3 =2, so possible splits: (1,1). U is U2=2. So the path would be R, UU, R. So that's R UU R. Direction changes at step 1 (R to U) and step 3 (U to R). So two direction changes. Similarly, starting with U: U, R, U. Similarly.



---------------

Alternatively, the number of paths should be calculated as:

Starting with R: compositions of 2 into 2 parts for R (since starting with R, three runs would mean two R runs? 

---------------

Wait, no. Wait in 2x2 grid, to have three runs, starting with R:

The runs would be R, U, R. So two R runs and one U run? 

---------------

Wait, no, three runs total. So starting with R, the runs are R, U, R. So R1 + R2 =2, and U1=2? 

---------------

Wait, no, in 2x2 grid, total R is 2 and U is 2. So R1 + R2 =2, with each R_i ≥1. That's C(1,1)=1 (since 2-1 choose 2-1). The U is U1=2, which is only 1 way. So total for starting with R is 1*1=1. Similarly starting with U would be 1. So total 2 paths. 

But let's list all paths with two direction changes:

Possible paths:

Right, Right, Up, Up: changes once (at step 2). Not two.

Right, Up, Right, Up: changes three times.



---------------

Wait, maybe in 2x2 grid, a path with two direction changes would be like R, U, R, U but that's four steps with three direction changes. 

---------------

Wait, confusion here. Maybe my initial approach is wrong?

Wait, hold on. In the 2x2 grid, moving from (0,0) to (2,2). The path must be 4 steps. Let's see:

A path that changes direction exactly two times. Let's see.

First, starting with R:

If you start R, then to have two direction changes, you must have three runs. For example:

R, R, U, U: that's only one direction change (after two R's). Not enough.

R, U, R, U: that's three direction changes (after first R, then after U, then after R). So three direction changes. So that's too many.



---------------

Alternatively, R, U, U, R: same as above.

Hmm, maybe starting with R, two direction changes would require two runs? 

---------------

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, direction changes are when you switch direction. So starting direction is R, then after some steps, you switch to U (that's one direction change), then switch back to R (second direction change). So three runs: R, U, R. The total steps would be R1 + U1 + R2 = 2 + 2 (since total steps are 4). 

---------------

Wait, but R1 + R2 must be 2 (total R steps) and U1 must be 2. So R1 and R2 each at least 1. So possible splits for R: (1,1). So the path is R, UU, R. So that's R, U, U, R. This path has two direction changes: after the first R (to U), and after the second U (to R). So that is two direction changes. 

---------------

Wait, so that's two direction changes. So that's a valid path. Similarly, starting with U: U, R, U, R. So that's another path. 

So in total, there are two such paths, which matches the calculation. So according to the formula, for a 2x2 grid (so n=2), starting with R: the number is C(2-1, (number of R runs -1)) * C(2-1, (number of U runs -1)). 

---------------

Wait, in this case, for starting with R, R runs are 2, so C(2-1, 2-1) = C(1,1)=1, and U runs are 1, so C(2-1,1-1)=C(1,0)=1? 

---------------

Wait, maybe my previous formula was slightly off. Wait let's see:

Wait in the original problem for the 8x8 grid, starting with R, we had three R runs and two U runs. So for the R runs (three parts), the number of compositions is C(8-1,3-1)=C(7,2). Similarly, for U runs (two parts), it's C(8-1,2-1)=C(7,1). 

Similarly, in the 2x2 grid, starting with R, the R runs are two parts (since three runs total, starting with R: R, U, R), so R is split into two parts, so compositions of 2 into 2 parts: C(2-1,2-1)=C(1,1)=1. The U runs are one part (since two U runs? 

---------------

Wait no, in the 2x2 grid starting with R, the U runs are just one run (the middle one). 

---------------

Wait, so U is split into 1 part? So the number of compositions for U would be C(2-1,1-1)=C(1,0)=1. So indeed 1*1=1 for starting with R, and similarly starting with U gives another 1, so total 2. So that works.

Therefore, the formula seems okay. So in the 8x8 grid, the answer would be 2 * C(7,2)*C(7,1). Let's compute that again.

C(7,2) is 21, C(7,1)=7. So 21 *7 is 147, multiplied by 2 is 294. So the answer is 294? Hmm, but let me think again.



---------------

Wait, hold on. Wait in the problem statement, they mention "paths of length 16". Since an 8x8 grid requires moving 8 right and 8 up, so total steps 16. So that's okay. The direction changes are exactly four. So with five runs. So the formula applies here.



---------------

Wait, but let me check with another small example. Let's take a 1x1 grid. From (0,0) to (1,1). So paths of length 2. The possible paths are RU or UR. Each has one direction change. So if we wanted paths with exactly one direction change, which is all of them. So according to the formula, starting with R: R runs are two runs? 

---------------

Wait no, in 1x1 grid, starting with R, the runs would be R, U. So two runs, which is one direction change. So the number of paths starting with R would be C(1-1, 2-1) for R (since R is split into one part, so compositions of 1 into 1 part, which is 1, but wait maybe the formula would be different here? 

---------------

Wait perhaps the formula is:

For an n x n grid, moving from (0,0) to (n,n), the number of paths starting with direction D (R or U), with k direction changes (so k+1 runs), would be:

If starting with R, the number of R runs is (k+1 +1)/2 if k+1 is odd? 

---------------

Wait maybe better to think in terms of runs.

Suppose the number of direction changes is t, so the number of runs is t+1. Since starting with R, the runs alternate R, U, R,... So if there are t+1 runs, then if t+1 is odd, the last run is R, and the number of R runs is (t+2)/2? 

---------------

Wait perhaps better to formalize.

Wait in general, for starting with R and having m runs, the number of R runs is ceil(m/2), and U runs is floor(m/2). So if the number of runs is odd, the starting direction has one more run.

Therefore, for m runs, starting with R: number of R runs is (m+1)/2, and U runs (m-1)/2 if m is odd. Since in our problem, m=5 (since direction changes 4), so starting with R gives 3 R runs and 2 U runs. Which matches the original setup.

Therefore, the formula for starting with R would be:

Number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts (for R runs) times compositions of 8 into 2 parts (for U runs). Each composition into k parts is C(n-1,k-1). So indeed, C(7,2)*C(7,1). So that formula holds.

Therefore, for the 8x8 grid, the total is 2 * C(7,2)*C(7,1) = 2 * 21 *7 = 294. Hmm.



---------------

But wait, let me check another small grid. Let's take a 3x3 grid. Let's see how many paths have exactly two direction changes. That would correspond to three runs. Let's see.

Starting with R: R, U, R. The total R steps: R1 + R3 =3. Each at least 1, so compositions of 3 into 2 parts: C(2,1)=2. The U steps: U2 =3. So only 1 way. So starting with R gives 2*1=2 paths. Similarly starting with U gives another 2 paths, so total 4.



---------------

Alternatively, let's count manually. For a 3x3 grid, paths from (0,0) to (3,3) with exactly two direction changes. Starting with R:

Possible paths would be like RRRUUUR? No, wait three runs. Let me think:

Starting with R, then U, then R. So for example:

RRR UUU R → but R's total is 4? 

---------------

Wait no, total R's must be 3. So R1 + R3 =3, so possible splits like (1,2), (2,1), (3,0). 

---------------

Wait no, they must be at least 1. So (1,2), (2,1). So two options. The U part must be 3 steps. So the path would be like R (1), U (3), R (2). So R UUU RR. Or R (2), U (3), R (1). So RR UUU R. So two paths. Similarly starting with U: UUU RRR U, etc. So total four. Which matches the formula's result. So that works.

Therefore, the formula seems correct. Therefore, for the original problem, the answer is 294. 

---------------

Wait but let me check once more. 

Wait another way to think: the number of direction changes is 4, so the number of runs is 5. Each path is a sequence of runs, alternating between R and U. The number of R runs and U runs depends on starting direction.

If starting with R, then R runs are 3, U runs 2. Each R run must have at least 1, same for U. So the number of ways is (number of ways to split R into 3 parts) * (number of ways to split U into 2 parts). Which is C(8-1,3-1)*C(8-1,2-1)=C(7,2)*C(7,1)=21*7=147. Similarly starting with U gives the same. So total 294. That seems correct.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the problem counts direction changes as the number of corners? Like each turn is a direction change. So moving right, then up is one direction change, then right again is another? 

---------------

Wait, no, each time you switch direction, that's a single direction change. So from right to up is one change, then up to right is another, etc. So the total number is indeed the number of switches between directions. So for five runs, there are four switches. So that's correct.

Therefore, I think the answer is 294. 

---------------

Wait but let me think again. Wait in the problem statement, it says "the last line of your response should be your integer answer within \boxed{}". So I need to be sure.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering starting direction. Wait, but since starting with R or U are separate cases, and each contribute equally, so adding them is correct. 



---------------

Alternatively, is there a different way to model this?

Alternatively, the total number of paths with exactly k direction changes is 2 * C(n-1, k/2) * C(n-1, (k/2)-1) or something else? 

---------------

Wait, perhaps not. Wait, let me think in terms of combinations.

Suppose that in order to have exactly four direction changes, the path must have five runs. The direction alternates starting with either R or U. Let me think of the runs as a sequence. For starting with R, the runs are R, U, R, U, R. Each of the R runs must sum to 8, each U runs must sum to 8. Each run is at least 1. So the number of ways is the number of ways to partition the 8 R steps into 3 runs (each ≥1) multiplied by the number of ways to partition the 8 U steps into 2 runs (each ≥1). 

The number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts is C(7,2), and into 2 parts is C(7,1). So the total is C(7,2)*C(7,1). Similarly for starting with U. Thus, 2*C(7,2)*C(7,1)=2*21*7=294.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the problem counts the direction changes as the number of times you turn, so for example, in the path RRUU..., the first turn is after the first R, then again after the second R to go up? 

---------------

Wait no, actually, direction changes occur whenever you switch direction. So in RRUU..., the first two R's are in the same direction, so the direction change is only when you switch to U. So that's one direction change. So the total direction changes are the number of switches between R and U. Hence, the number of direction changes is one less than the number of runs. Since runs are 5, direction changes are 4. So that's correct.

Therefore, I think the answer is 294. 

---------------

Wait but let me see if another approach gives the same.

Another approach: the number of paths with exactly m direction changes is equal to 2 * C(16 - 1, m) or something? 

---------------

Wait, no, that's probably not.

Alternatively, the number of such paths can be modeled using combinations with constraints. Let me think in terms of steps. Each path is a sequence of R and U with 8 each. The direction changes are the points where R and U alternate. To have exactly four direction changes, the path must switch direction four times, so there are five runs. 

The number of such paths is equal to 2 * (number of ways to arrange the runs). For each starting direction, you have to distribute the steps into the runs. For starting with R, as before, the R runs total 8 over 3 runs, and U over 2 runs. So that gives the same calculation. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe there is a formula for this. In general, for an n x n grid, the number of paths from (0,0) to (n,n) with exactly k direction changes is 2 * C(n-1, (k)/2) * C(n-1, (k-2)/2) if starting direction is considered? 

---------------

Wait, perhaps not exactly. Wait, in our case, k=4 direction changes, so the number of runs is 5. Since starting direction can be R or U, then:

If starting with R, the number of R runs is ceil(5/2) =3, and U runs is 2. So the formula would be C(8-1,3-1)*C(8-1,2-1). So yes, that's C(7,2)*C(7,1). So same as before.

Therefore, I think my original calculation is correct. So I think the answer is 294.



---------------

Wait, but just to confirm once more with another perspective. Suppose we model the path as a sequence of moves. Let's think of the path as starting with either R or U, then alternating directions each time, with 5 runs. Let me consider starting with R:

We need to distribute 8 R's into 3 runs, each at least 1, and 8 U's into 2 runs, each at least 1.

The number of ways to distribute the R's is the number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts, which is C(7,2). Similarly, the U's into 2 parts is C(7,1). Multiply them together for the total for starting with R. Same for starting with U, so total is 2*C(7,2)*C(7,1)=294. 

Therefore, I feel confident that 294 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{294}


To solve the problem of finding the number of paths on an 8x8 grid from the lower left corner to the upper right corner that change direction exactly four times, we start by noting that such paths must consist of five runs (segments of consecutive moves in the same direction). Each direction change alternates between right (R) and up (U) moves. 

Since we need exactly four direction changes, the path will have five runs. The path can start with either a right move or an up move, leading to two cases:

1. **Starting with a right move (R):**
   - The runs will be in the order R, U, R, U, R.
   - The total number of right moves (8) must be distributed among three runs, each of at least 1. This is a composition problem: the number of ways to write 8 as the sum of three positive integers, which is given by \(\binom{7}{2}\).
   - The total number of up moves (8) must be distributed among two runs, each of at least 1. This is another composition problem: the number of ways to write 8 as the sum of two positive integers, which is given by \(\binom{7}{1}\).
   - The number of paths starting with R is therefore \(\binom{7}{2} \times \binom{7}{1}\).

2. **Starting with an up move (U):**
   - The runs will be in the order U, R, U, R, U.
   - The total number of up moves (8) must be distributed among three runs, each of at least 1. This is a composition problem: \(\binom{7}{2}\).
   - The total number of right moves (8) must be distributed among two runs, each of at least 1. This is another composition problem: \(\binom{7}{1}\).
   - The number of paths starting with U is therefore \(\binom{7}{2} \times \binom{7}{1}\).

Summing both cases, the total number of paths is:
\[
2 \times \left( \binom{7}{2} \times \binom{7}{1} \right)
\]

Calculating the values:
- \(\binom{7}{2} = 21\)
- \(\binom{7}{1} = 7\)

Thus, the total number of paths is:
\[
2 \times (21 \times 7) = 2 \times 147 = 294
\]

The final answer is \(\boxed{294}\).
