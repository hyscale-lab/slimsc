Okay, so I have this problem here where Alice picks a set A of positive integers, and then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. The total number of such sets B is 2024, and I need to find the sum of the elements of A. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Alice's set A can be any set of positive integers, and Bob is considering all possible nonempty finite sets B where the biggest number in B is an element of A. The count of all these B sets is 2024, and from that, we have to figure out what A is and then sum its elements. 

I think the key here is to figure out how the number of such sets B relates to the elements of A. Maybe there's a way to express the number of B sets in terms of the elements of A. Let me think about how the maximum element condition affects the count.

Suppose A is a finite set. Let's say A has elements {a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ} where a₁ < a₂ < ... < aₙ. Since the maximum element of B must be in A, each set B must have its maximum element as one of these a's. 

For each element a in A, the number of sets B where the maximum is exactly a would be equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1} (since all elements except the maximum can be any subset of the numbers below a), and then including a itself. Since the set B must be non-empty, the subsets of {1, ..., a-1} can be any subset except the empty set? 

---------------

Wait, actually, no. Wait, the set B has to include the maximum element a, right? Because the maximum has to be in A. So actually, for each a in A, the number of sets B with maximum exactly a is equal to 2^{a-1}. Because you can choose any subset of the numbers from 1 to a-1, and then include a. Since the set must be non-empty, but since a is included, even if you choose the empty subset from the lower numbers, the set {a} is still non-empty. Therefore, for each a, the number of sets with maximum a is 2^{a-1}. 



---------------

Wait, let me check with a small example. Suppose A = {1}. Then the only set B possible is {1}, so that's 1 set. According to the formula, 2^{1-1} = 1, which matches. If A = {2}, then the sets B with maximum 2 are {2}, {1,2}. That's 2 sets, which is 2^{2-1}=2. If A = {3}, then the sets are {3}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}, so 4 sets, which is 2^{3-1}=4. That seems to hold. 

Therefore, if A has elements {a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ}, then the total number of sets B is the sum over each a in A of 2^{a - 1}. Because each a contributes 2^{a-1} sets where it's the maximum. 

So the problem says that this sum equals 2024. Therefore, we have:

Σ_{a ∈ A} 2^{a - 1} = 2024.

We need to find a set A of positive integers such that when we compute this sum, it's 2024, and then find the sum of the elements of A.

So essentially, we need to express 2024 as a sum of terms of the form 2^{a-1}, where each a is a positive integer, and each term corresponds to an element in A. Since each term is 2^{a-1}, that's equivalent to expressing 2024 in binary, where each bit represents whether a particular exponent is included. 

---------------

Wait, actually, 2^{a-1} is the same as 2^{k} where k = a-1, so each term in the sum is a power of two, so the sum is just the binary representation of 2024. 



---------------

Wait, but each term in the sum must be unique in their exponent? Wait, actually, no. Wait, but in the problem, A is a set, so each a is unique. Therefore, each term in the sum must be a distinct power of two. Therefore, the sum Σ_{a ∈ A} 2^{a - 1} must be a number whose binary representation has 1s exactly at the positions corresponding to (a-1) for each a in A. Therefore, the sum is just the binary representation of 2024. 

Therefore, if we write 2024 in binary, then each position where there is a 1 corresponds to an exponent (a-1), so the exponents are the positions of the 1s, and therefore the elements a are (position + 1). 

Therefore, the elements of A correspond to the positions of the 1s in the binary representation of 2024 plus 1. 

---------------

Wait, let's see:

Let me confirm this. Let me take an example. Suppose the sum is 5, which is 101 in binary. Then the binary digits are 1 (for 2^2) and 1 (for 2^0). Therefore, the exponents are 2 and 0, so the a's would be 3 and 1. Then the sum of elements of A is 3 + 1 = 4. Let's check: For A = {1,3}, the number of sets B would be 2^{0} + 2^{2} = 1 + 4 = 5. Which matches. So that works. So the correspondence is that the binary digits of the total count (here 2024) give the exponents (a-1), so the elements a are the exponents plus 1. 

Therefore, to solve the problem, we need to:

1. Convert 2024 to binary.
2. Find the positions of the 1s (starting from 0 for the least significant bit).
3. Each position corresponds to an exponent (a-1) so the elements a are (position +1).
4. Sum those a's.

Therefore, let's do that step by step.

First, convert 2024 to binary. Let me compute that:

2024 divided by 2: 1012, remainder 0

1012 /2 = 506, r0

506/2 = 253, r0

253/2 =126 r1

126/2=63 r0

63/2=31 r1

31/2=15 r1

15/2=7 r1

7/2=3 r1

3/2=1 r1

1/2=0 r1

So writing the remainders from last to first: 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0.



---------------

Wait let me count the divisions step by step:

Starting with 2024:

2024 ÷2 = 1012 R0

1012 ÷2 =506 R0

506 ÷2 =253 R0

253 ÷2 =126 R1

126 ÷2 =63 R0

63 ÷2 =31 R1

31 ÷2 =15 R1

15 ÷2 =7 R1

7 ÷2 =3 R1

3 ÷2 =1 R1

1 ÷2 =0 R1

So the remainders, from last to first (i.e., the binary digits from highest to lowest):

Starting with the last division: the first remainder is the least significant bit. 

---------------

Wait, actually, the remainders are collected in reverse order. Let me list the remainders in the order they were obtained:

First division: 0

Then 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.



---------------

Wait let me list all remainders in order:

Division steps:

1. 2024 /2 → R0

2. 1012 /2 → R0

3. 506 /2 → R0

4. 253 /2 → R1

5. 126 /2 → R0

6. 63 /2 → R1

7. 31 /2 → R1

8. 15 /2 → R1

9. 7 /2 → R1

10. 3 /2 → R1

11. 1 /2 → R1

So the remainders are: 0 (step1), 0 (step2), 0 (step3), 1 (step4), 0 (step5), 1 (step6), 1 (step7), 1 (step8), 1 (step9), 1 (step10), 1 (step11).

But to get the binary number, we need to read the remainders from last division to first. The last division is step11, which had R1, then step10 R1, step9 R1, step8 R1, step7 R1, step6 R1, step5 R0, step4 R1, step3 R0, step2 R0, step1 R0.



---------------

Wait, that might be confusing. Let me count how many bits there are. The highest power of 2 less than 2024 is 1024 (2^10 = 1024; 2^11=2048 which is over). Let's see:

2^10 = 1024. 2024 - 1024 = 999. So 2^10 is part of it.

2^9 =512. 999-512=487.

2^8=256. 487-256=231.

2^7=128. 231-128=103.

2^6=64. 103-64=39.

2^5=32. 39-32=7.

2^2=4. 7-4=3.

2^1=2. 3-2=1.

2^0=1. 1-1=0.



---------------

Wait that's a different way but let me see:

Alternatively, 2024 divided by 2^10 is 1.9765625, so 2^10 is included.

Let me compute 2024 in binary:

Compute 2^10 = 1024, subtract that from 2024: 2024-1024 = 999

2^9 = 512. 999-512 = 487 → so bit 9 is 1.

2^8 =256. 487-256=231 → bit8=1

2^7=128. 231-128=103 → bit7=1

2^6=64. 103-64=39 → bit6=1

2^5=32. 39-32=7 → bit5=1

2^4=16. 7 <16 → bit4=0

2^3=8. 7 <8 → bit3=0

2^2=4. 7-4=3 → bit2=1

2^1=2. 3-2=1 → bit1=1

2^0=1. 1-1=0 → bit0=1



---------------

Wait, so let's list the bits from bit10 down to bit0:

Bit10:1 (since we had 2^10)

Bit9:1

Bit8:1

Bit7:1

Bit6:1

Bit5:1

Bit4:0

Bit3:0

Bit2:1

Bit1:1

Bit0:1

So the binary is 11111100111.

Let me verify that:

Let's compute 11111100111 in binary:

From right to left, the bits are:

Position 0:1 (2^0=1)

Position1:1 (2^1=2)

Position2:1 (2^2=4)

Position3:0 (2^3=8)

Position4:0 (2^4=16)

Position5:1 (2^5=32)

Position6:1 (2^6=64)

Position7:1 (2^7=128)

Position8:1 (2^8=256)

Position9:1 (2^9=512)

Position10:1 (2^10=1024)



---------------

Wait, actually, when written as 11111100111, the leftmost digit is the highest bit. So let's count the positions properly:

Starting from the right, the rightmost bit is position0. So the number 11111100111 has 11 bits. Let's list each bit's value:

Positions:

10:1 (2^10)

9:1 (2^9)

8:1 (2^8)

7:1 (2^7)

6:1 (2^6)

5:1 (2^5)

4:0 (2^4)

3:0 (2^3)

2:1 (2^2)

1:1 (2^1)

0:1 (2^0)

Adding these up:

2^10 +2^9 +2^8 +2^7 +2^6 +2^5 +2^2 +2^1 +2^0

Compute each term:

2^10 = 1024

2^9 = 512 → total so far: 1536

2^8 =256 → total: 1792

2^7=128 → 1920

2^6=64 → 1984

2^5=32 → 2016

2^2=4 → 2020

2^1=2 → 2022

2^0=1 → 2023. 

---------------

Wait, but that gives 2023, but we need 2024. Hmm, so maybe my calculation is wrong.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I messed up the bits. Let me check again.

Wait, 2024 divided by 2 gives remainders as before. Let me try another way.



---------------

Alternatively, let me use the division method step by step again:

2024 ÷2 =1012 R0

1012 ÷2=506 R0

506 ÷2=253 R0

253 ÷2=126 R1

126 ÷2=63 R0

63 ÷2=31 R1

31 ÷2=15 R1

15 ÷2=7 R1

7 ÷2=3 R1

3 ÷2=1 R1

1 ÷2=0 R1

So the remainders, from last to first (starting from the bottom of the division steps):

The last division was 1 ÷2, remainder1, then 3 ÷2 R1, etc. So the remainders in order from last to first division are:

1 (from 1/2), 1 (3/2), 1 (7/2), 1 (15/2), 1 (31/2), 1 (63/2), 0 (126/2), 1 (253/2), 0 (506/2), 0 (1012/2), 0 (2024/2).



---------------

Wait, let me list them in the order they were obtained, but reversed:

Starting from the last division to the first:

1 (from 1/2)

1 (3/2)

1 (7/2)

1 (15/2)

1 (31/2)

1 (63/2)

0 (126/2)

1 (253/2)

0 (506/2)

0 (1012/2)

0 (2024/2)

So that's 11 remainders. So writing them in order from first division to last gives the binary number as the remainders read from bottom up. 

---------------

Wait, actually, the first remainder is the least significant bit (LSB), and the last is the most significant bit (MSB). So the binary number is written as the remainders in reverse order of how they were obtained.

So the first remainder (0) is the LSB (position0), and the last remainder (1) is the MSB (position10). So the binary number is:

From MSB to LSB:

1 (position10), 1 (position9), 1 (position8), 1 (position7), 1 (position6), 1 (position5), 0 (position4), 1 (position3?), wait wait, let's list them properly.



---------------

Wait, the remainders in reverse order (from last division to first division):

The remainders in the order of divisions (first division first) are:

0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1.

So reversing that gives:

1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0.

So that's 11 bits. Let's write that as bits 10 to 0:

Bit10:1

Bit9:1

Bit8:1

Bit7:1

Bit6:1

Bit5:1

Bit4:0

Bit3:1

Bit2:0

Bit1:0

Bit0:0



---------------

Wait, that can't be right because when I add up those bits, let's see:

2^10 +2^9 +2^8 +2^7 +2^6 +2^5 +2^3.

Calculating:

1024 +512=1536

+256=1792

+128=1920

+64=1984

+32=2016

+8=2024. 

Ah, there we go. So the binary is 11111101000. 

---------------

Wait, let me see:

Wait the bits are:

Position10:1

Position9:1

Position8:1

Position7:1

Position6:1

Position5:1

Position4:0

Position3:1

Position2:0

Position1:0

Position0:0

So writing the bits from left (position10) to right (position0):

1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0. 

So the binary number is 11111101000.

Therefore, 2024 in binary is 11111101000. Let's confirm that:

Breaking down:

2^10 =1024,

2^9=512 → 1024+512=1536,

2^8=256 →1536+256=1792,

2^7=128 →1792+128=1920,

2^6=64 →1920+64=1984,

2^5=32 →1984+32=2016,

2^3=8 →2016+8=2024.

Yes, that adds up correctly. So the binary digits are 1 at positions 10,9,8,7,6,5, and 3. The positions here are counted from 0 starting at the right. 

---------------

Wait, actually, in the standard binary notation, the rightmost digit is position0. So in the binary number 11111101000, the rightmost digit is the 0th position. Let me write it out with positions:

Let me write the binary number as:

Positions (from right, starting at 0):

Position10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

But actually, the rightmost digit is position0. Let's write the bits:

The binary is 11111101000, which is 11 bits. Let's index them from right (position0) to left (position10):



---------------

Wait actually, no. Let me write the bits in order from right (LSB) to left (MSB):

Wait, the number is 11111101000. Let's count the digits from right:

Starting from the right:

The rightmost digit is 0 (position0),

next is 0 (position1),

next 0 (position2),

then 1 (position3),

then 0 (position4),

then 1 (position5),

then 1 (position6),

then 1 (position7),

then 1 (position8),

then 1 (position9),

then 1 (position10).



---------------

Wait, that's confusing. Let me write the binary number as:

The leftmost digit is the highest power. Let me write it as:

Position 10: 1

Position 9:1

Position8:1

Position7:1

Position6:1

Position5:1

Position4:0

Position3:1

Position2:0

Position1:0

Position0:0

Therefore, the 1 bits are at positions 10,9,8,7,6,5, and 3. So the positions with 1s are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

Therefore, each of these positions corresponds to exponents (a-1) in the terms 2^{a-1}. Therefore, the elements a in set A are (position +1). 

Therefore, the elements of A are:

For each position with a 1:

Position10: a =10 +1 =11,

Position9: a=9+1=10,

Position8: a=8+1=9,

Position7: a=7+1=8,

Position6: a=6+1=7,

Position5: a=5+1=6,

Position3: a=3+1=4.



---------------

Wait, so the elements are 11,10,9,8,7,6,4. 

Wait, let me confirm:

The positions with 1s are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3. So adding 1 to each gives the a's as 11,10,9,8,7,6,4. 

Therefore, the set A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}. 

Now, the problem asks for the sum of the elements of A. Let's add them up:

4 +6 =10,

10 +7=17,

17+8=25,

25+9=34,

34+10=44,

44+11=55.



---------------

Wait, that's 4+6+7+8+9+10+11. Let me compute again step by step:

4 + 6 = 10,

10 +7 =17,

17+8=25,

25+9=34,

34+10=44,

44+11=55.

Yes, total is 55. So the sum of elements of A is 55. 



---------------

Wait, but let me verify once again to make sure I didn't miss any bits or miscalculate the positions. Let me go back.

The binary representation of 2024 is 11111101000. Let's list the bits from position0 (rightmost) to position10 (leftmost):

Positions 0 to 10:

Position0: 0,

Position1:0,

Position2:0,

Position3:1,

Position4:0,

Position5:1,

Position6:1,

Position7:1,

Position8:1,

Position9:1,

Position10:1.

So the 1s are at positions 3,5,6,7,8,9,10. Therefore, the exponents (a-1) are those positions, so a = position +1. Therefore:

positions3 → a=4,

5→6,

6→7,

7→8,

8→9,

9→10,

10→11.

Therefore, the elements are 4,6,7,8,9,10,11. Sum is indeed 4+6+7+8+9+10+11 = let's check:

4+6 is 10,

10+7=17,

17+8=25,

25+9=34,

34+10=44,

44+11=55.

So that's correct. 

Therefore, the answer should be 55. 



---------------

Wait, but let me cross-verify once again with the problem. The key idea is that each element a in A contributes 2^{a-1} sets. So if A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}, the total number of sets B would be 2^{3} +2^{5} +2^{6} +2^{7} +2^{8} +2^{9} +2^{10}. Let's compute this:

2^3 =8,

2^5=32,

2^6=64,

2^7=128,

2^8=256,

2^9=512,

2^10=1024.

Adding these up:

Start with 8 +32 =40,

40 +64=104,

104+128=232,

232+256=488,

488+512=1000,

1000+1024=2024. 

Perfect! That adds up to exactly 2024. So that checks out. Therefore, the set A is correct, and the sum of its elements is indeed 55. 

Therefore, the answer is 55, and I need to present it in boxed notation.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{55}


Alice chooses a set \( A \) of positive integers. Bob lists all finite nonempty sets \( B \) of positive integers such that the maximum element of \( B \) belongs to \( A \). The total number of such sets \( B \) is 2024. We need to find the sum of the elements of \( A \).

To solve this, we note that each element \( a \) in \( A \) contributes \( 2^{a-1} \) sets \( B \) where the maximum element is \( a \). Therefore, the total number of sets \( B \) is the sum of \( 2^{a-1} \) for all \( a \) in \( A \). This sum must equal 2024.

We convert 2024 to its binary representation to determine which powers of 2 are included. The binary representation of 2024 is \( 11111101000_2 \), which corresponds to the positions of the 1s in the binary digits. These positions (starting from 0 for the least significant bit) are 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. 

Each position \( k \) corresponds to an element \( a = k + 1 \) in \( A \). Therefore, the elements of \( A \) are \( 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, \) and \( 11 \).

Summing these elements:
\[
4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55
\]

Thus, the sum of the elements of \( A \) is \(\boxed{55}\).
