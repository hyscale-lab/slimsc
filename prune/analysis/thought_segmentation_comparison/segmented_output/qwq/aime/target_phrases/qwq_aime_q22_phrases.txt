Okay, so I have this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus inscribed in it. The question is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, let me see. The hyperbola equation given is x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. The rhombus ABCD has its diagonals intersecting at the origin. Since it's a rhombus, the diagonals should bisect each other at right angles? 

---------------

Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles only if it's a square, but in general, they just bisect each other. 

---------------

Wait, actually, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals do bisect each other at right angles. Let me confirm that. Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So that's a key property here.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, that means the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So the coordinates of the four vertices must satisfy that if A is (x, y), then the opposite vertex C is (-x, -y), and similarly for B and D. So the vertices come in pairs symmetric about the origin. Let me note that.

So let's suppose that the four vertices of the rhombus are A (x1, y1), B (x2, y2), C (-x1, -y1), D (-x2, -y2). Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, so AB = BC = CD = DA. Also, the diagonals are perpendicular. 

---------------

Wait, but maybe it's easier to use the properties of the diagonals here. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1. But since the diagonals are AC and BD, their slopes can be calculated. Let me think.



---------------

Alternatively, since the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, maybe we can parametrize the points such that the diagonals are along the coordinate axes? 

---------------

Wait, but the hyperbola is given in standard form, so its transverse axis is the x-axis. Hmm, maybe not necessarily aligned with the coordinate axes. 

---------------

Wait, but the diagonals intersect at the origin, so their midpoints are at the origin. Let me try to parametrize the points.



---------------

Alternatively, since the hyperbola is symmetric about both axes, perhaps the rhombus can be considered with vertices lying in such a way that the diagonals are along the coordinate axes? Let me see. If the diagonals are along the x and y axes, then points A and C would be on the x-axis, and B and D on the y-axis? But then the hyperbola equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1 would require that on the x-axis, y=0, so x²/20 = 1 => x=±2√5, and on the y-axis, x=0, but that would give -y²/24 =1 which is impossible. So that can't be. So the diagonals can't be along the coordinate axes. Hmm.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the diagonals are not aligned with the coordinate axes. Since the hyperbola is symmetric, perhaps the diagonals are symmetric with respect to the axes. Let me think of parametrizing the points.

Since the hyperbola is given by x²/20 - y²/24 =1, it's a hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The vertices are at (±√20, 0), which is ±2√5, approximately ±4.472.

So, the rhombus is inscribed in this hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin. Let me consider points A and C as endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D as endpoints of the other diagonal. Since the diagonals bisect each other at the origin, the coordinates of A and C are negatives of each other, same with B and D.

Let me denote point A as (a, b) so point C is (-a, -b). Similarly, point B as (c, d), so point D is (-c, -d). Since the diagonals are AC and BD, their midpoints are the origin, which is given. Now, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Therefore, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. The vector AC is (2a, 2b), and BD is (2c, 2d). Therefore, their dot product should be zero: (2a)(2c) + (2b)(2d) = 0 ⇒ 4ac + 4bd = 0 ⇒ ac + bd = 0.

So that's one condition. 

---------------

Another condition is that all four points lie on the hyperbola, so substituting into the equation:

For point A: (a²)/20 - (b²)/24 =1,

For point B: (c²)/20 - (d²)/24 =1,

Similarly for C and D, but they are negatives so they satisfy the same equations.

Also, since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal. The sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. Let's compute the length squared of AB and AD and set them equal?



---------------

Wait, but maybe there's a better way. Since it's a rhombus, the sides are equal, so the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, etc. But maybe using vectors would be better here. Let me think.



---------------

Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other, the rhombus can also be thought of in terms of the lengths of the diagonals. Let me denote the lengths of the diagonals as AC and BD. Let’s denote AC = 2p and BD = 2q, so that the half-diagonals are p and q. Since they are perpendicular, the area of the rhombus is (2p)(2q)/2 = 2pq. But maybe the lengths of the diagonals can be related to BD², which is the quantity we need to find the infimum of.



---------------

Wait, the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi". So we need to find the infimum of BD² over all such rhombi, but actually the question is phrased as the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. 

---------------

Wait, actually, that wording is a bit confusing. Wait, the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So that would be the infimum of BD², but phrased as the supremum of all numbers that are less than BD² for all rhombi. 

---------------

Wait, actually, maybe it's the infimum of BD². Because the greatest lower bound. Hmm, but let me parse the question again.

"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, that is, find the supremum of all real numbers M such that M < BD² for all rhombi ABCD. Therefore, that supremum would be the infimum of BD² over all such rhombi. So, essentially, we need to find the minimal possible BD², and then the answer is that minimal value, since the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be the infimum, which is the minimal BD². 

---------------

Wait, but perhaps BD can get arbitrarily small? Hmm, need to check.

Alternatively, maybe BD² has a lower bound, and we need to find that lower bound. Let me see.

First, let's formalize the problem.

We have four points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 =1 forming a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. We need to find the infimum of BD², which is the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi.

To approach this, perhaps parametrizing the points in terms of angles or hyperbola parameters.

Since the hyperbola is given, maybe parametrizing points on the hyperbola using hyperbolic functions. Let me recall that a standard parametrization for hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b² =1 is (a secθ, b tanθ). 

---------------

Alternatively, using coordinates (a cosh t, b sinh t). Let me think which one is better here.

Alternatively, since the hyperbola is symmetric, perhaps using coordinates (x, y) such that points A and C are (x1, y1) and (-x1, -y1), and points B and D are (x2, y2) and (-x2, -y2). Then, since it's a rhombus, the vectors AB and AD must have the same length. Let me write vectors:

Vector AB is (x2 - x1, y2 - y1),

Vector AD is (-x2 - x1, -y2 - y1).



---------------

Wait, actually, point D is (-x2, -y2). So vector AD is from A(x1,y1) to D(-x2,-y2): (-x2 -x1, -y2 - y1). Hmm, but in a rhombus, all sides are equal. So the length of AB must equal the length of AD.



---------------

Wait, perhaps this is getting too involved. Maybe another approach.

Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1. Let's see:

The diagonal AC has slope (y1 - (-y1))/(x1 - (-x1)) = (2y1)/(2x1) = y1/x1.

Similarly, diagonal BD has slope (d - (-d))/(c - (-c)) = (2d)/(2c) = d/c.

Since they are perpendicular, (y1/x1)*(d/c) = -1 ⇒ (y1 d)/(x1 c) = -1 ⇒ y1 d = -x1 c.

But earlier we had from perpendicularity of diagonals (ac + bd =0). 

---------------

Wait, actually, the condition from perpendicularity of diagonals as vectors is that their dot product is zero. The vectors AC and BD are (2a, 2b) and (2c, 2d). So their dot product is 4ac + 4bd = 0 ⇒ ac + bd =0. So that's another equation.

Additionally, the points lie on the hyperbola:

For point A: (a²)/20 - (b²)/24 =1,

For point B: (c²)/20 - (d²)/24 =1.

So we have these equations:

1. ac + bd =0,

2. a²/20 - b²/24 =1,

3. c²/20 - d²/24 =1.

We need to find BD². Let's see, BD is the distance between points B and D. Since D is (-c, -d), then BD is the distance between (c, d) and (-c, -d):

BD² = (c - (-c))² + (d - (-d))² = (2c)^2 + (2d)^2 = 4c² +4d².

So BD squared is 4(c² +d²). Therefore, we need to find the minimal value of 4(c² + d²), given the constraints above.



---------------

Alternatively, since BD² =4(c² +d²), so the problem reduces to minimizing c² +d², given the constraints.

So, the problem becomes: minimize c² +d², given that c²/20 - d²/24 =1, and also that there exists a point (a, b) on the hyperbola (so a²/20 - b²/24=1) such that ac + bd =0.

Therefore, the problem is to find the minimal c² +d² over all (c,d) on the hyperbola and (a,b) on the hyperbola such that ac + bd =0.

Hmm, that seems a bit involved. Maybe we can use Lagrange multipliers or some optimization technique.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps we can express variables in terms of parameters. Let me consider parametrizing the hyperbola.

Let me parametrize points A and B on the hyperbola. Let's suppose for point A, let's use hyperbola parametrization. For hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 =1, a standard parametrization is x = sqrt(20) secθ, y = sqrt(24) tanθ. 

---------------

Alternatively, using hyperbolic functions: x = sqrt(20) cosh t, y = sqrt(24) sinh t. Either way, perhaps.

Let me try using hyperbola parametrization with hyperbolic functions. Let me set point A as (sqrt(20) cosh t, sqrt(24) sinh t). Then, point C is (-sqrt(20) cosh t, -sqrt(24) sinh t). Similarly, point B can be parametrized as (sqrt(20) cosh s, sqrt(24) sinh s), so point D is (-sqrt(20) cosh s, -sqrt(24) sinh s). 

---------------

Wait, but then we need to ensure that the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps parametrizing points A and B as different parameters.



---------------

Wait, but then the condition ac + bd =0. Let me substitute in terms of parameters.

Let me let A be (sqrt(20) cosh t, sqrt(24) sinh t),

and B be (sqrt(20) cosh s, sqrt(24) sinh s).

Then, the coordinates are:

a = sqrt(20) cosh t,

b = sqrt(24) sinh t,

c = sqrt(20) cosh s,

d = sqrt(24) sinh s.

Then, the condition ac + bd =0 becomes:

sqrt(20) cosh t * sqrt(20) cosh s + sqrt(24) sinh t * sqrt(24) sinh s =0,

which simplifies to:

20 cosh t cosh s +24 sinh t sinh s =0.

Hmm, that's the equation we have to satisfy.

Let me write that as:

20 cosh t cosh s +24 sinh t sinh s =0.

Hmm, perhaps we can factor this expression or find a relation between t and s.



---------------

Alternatively, let me write this as:

20 cosh t cosh s = -24 sinh t sinh s,

Divide both sides by cosh t cosh s,

20 = -24 (sinh t / cosh t)(sinh s / cosh s),

So,

20 = -24 tanh t tanh s,

Therefore,

tanh t tanh s = -20/24 = -5/6.

Hmm, so the product of the hyperbolic tangents of t and s is -5/6.

Interesting. So that's a relation between parameters t and s.

Our goal is to compute BD², which in terms of these parameters would be 4(c² + d²) =4[ (20 cosh² s) + (24 sinh² s) ].



---------------

Wait, let me compute c² +d²:

c = sqrt(20) cosh s,

so c² = 20 cosh² s,

d = sqrt(24) sinh s,

so d² =24 sinh² s,

so c² +d² =20 cosh² s +24 sinh² s.

Therefore, BD² =4*(20 cosh² s +24 sinh² s).

We need to find the minimal value of BD², so minimal value of 20 cosh² s +24 sinh² s, given that tanh t tanh s = -5/6, where t and s are parameters related through the hyperbola points A and B.

Hmm, but how do we relate t and s here?



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps we can express in terms of a single variable. Let me consider that since tanh t tanh s = -5/6, then tanh t = -5/(6 tanh s). Let me set u = tanh s, so tanh t = -5/(6u). Then, perhaps express everything in terms of u.

But we need to ensure that the hyperbola parametrization is valid. Also, since hyperbolic functions have certain ranges. Let me see.



---------------

Alternatively, let's note that cosh² s - sinh² s =1, so sinh² s = cosh² s -1.

Therefore, c² + d² =20 cosh² s +24 (cosh² s -1 ) =20 cosh² s +24 cosh² s -24 =44 cosh² s -24.

Therefore, BD² =4*(44 cosh² s -24)= 176 cosh² s -96.

So, BD² is expressed in terms of cosh² s. Therefore, to minimize BD², we need to minimize cosh² s. Since cosh² s is minimized when s is 0, but wait, s=0 would give cosh s =1, sinh s=0. Let me check if that's possible.



---------------

Wait, but if s=0, then point B would be (sqrt(20)*1, sqrt(24)*0)= (sqrt(20),0), which is on the hyperbola, since x²/20 -0= (20)/20=1, so that works. But then, what about the condition tanh t tanh s = -5/6? If s=0, then tanh s=0, so the left-hand side becomes tanh t *0 =0, but the right-hand side is -5/6. That's a contradiction. Therefore, s cannot be zero. So the minimal cosh s is not achievable at s=0.

Hmm, so we need to find the minimal value of cosh² s such that there exists a t where tanh t = -5/(6 tanh s). Let's see.

First, since tanh t must be a real number, so -5/(6 tanh s) must be in (-1,1). Therefore,

| -5/(6 tanh s) | <1,

so |5/(6 tanh s)| <1,

so |tanh s| >5/6.

Therefore, |tanh s| >5/6. Since tanh s is between -1 and 1, so this requires that tanh s >5/6 or tanh s < -5/6.

Therefore, s must satisfy tanh s >5/6 or tanh s < -5/6. Since cosh s is even in s, we can consider s positive (since sinh s and cosh s are even and odd functions respectively, so the expression would be symmetric in s). So let's consider s>0, so tanh s is positive, so tanh s>5/6. Therefore, s must satisfy tanh s>5/6. So s> arctanh(5/6). Let me compute arctanh(5/6). Since arctanh(x)=0.5*ln((1+x)/(1-x)), so arctanh(5/6)=0.5*ln(11/1)=0.5*ln(11)≈1.704. So s must be greater than that.

Therefore, the minimal value of cosh s occurs when s= arctanh(5/6). 

---------------

Wait, but s must be greater than arctanh(5/6). Hmm, but perhaps the minimal cosh s is achieved at the minimal s, which is s=arctanh(5/6). Let me check.

Yes, since cosh s is an increasing function for s>0, so the minimal cosh s occurs at the minimal s, which is arctanh(5/6). Therefore, the minimal cosh s is cosh(arctanh(5/6)). Let me compute that.

Let me recall that cosh(arctanh x)=1/sqrt(1 -x²). Let me confirm:

Let y = arctanh x ⇒ tanh y =x,

then cosh y =1/sqrt(1 -x²).

Yes, because 1 - tanh² y = sech² y,

so cosh y =1/ sqrt(1 - tanh² y)=1/sqrt(1 -x²).

Therefore, cosh(arctanh(5/6)) =1/sqrt(1 - (25/36))=1/sqrt(11/36)=6/sqrt(11).

Therefore, the minimal cosh s is 6/sqrt(11).

Therefore, the minimal cosh² s is (36)/11.

Therefore, plugging back into BD²:

BD² =176*(36/11) -96= (176/11)*36 -96= 16*36 -96= 576 -96=480.



---------------

Wait, let me compute step by step:

First, cosh² s = 36/11,

so BD² = 176*(36/11) -96,

176 divided by 11 is 16, so 16*36=576,

then 576 -96=480. So BD²=480 at this minimal point.



---------------

But wait, this is under the assumption that the minimal cosh s is achieved at s= arctanh(5/6). Let me confirm that this is indeed the minimal BD².



---------------

Alternatively, maybe we can use calculus here. Let me consider s as a variable, with tanh s >5/6, and express BD² in terms of s, then take derivative and find minimum.



---------------

Alternatively, let me proceed with substitution.

Let me set u = tanh s, so that u >5/6. Then,

cosh² s =1/(1 -u²),

since cosh² s - sinh² s =1, so sinh² s = (cosh² s -1),

and tanh s = sinh s /cosh s = u,

so sinh s = u cosh s,

so cosh² s =1 + sinh² s =1 + u² cosh² s,

so cosh² s (1 - u²)=1,

so cosh² s =1/(1 -u²).

Therefore, BD²=176 cosh² s -96=176/(1 - u²) -96.

But we also have the condition that tanh t = -5/(6u).

But we need to ensure that tanh t is real, so |tanh t|=| -5/(6u)| <1,

since u>5/6,

so | -5/(6u)| <1 ⇒ 5/(6u) <1 ⇒ u>5/6,

which is already satisfied. So, as long as u>5/6, the condition is satisfied.

Therefore, we can consider BD² as a function of u:

BD(u)=176/(1 -u²) -96, with u>5/6.

We need to find the minimal value of BD(u) over u>5/6.



---------------

Wait, but as u approaches 5/6 from above, 1 -u² approaches 1 -25/36=11/36, so 1/(1 -u²) approaches 36/11, so BD(u) approaches 176*(36/11) -96= same as before, 480.



---------------

Wait, but if u increases beyond 5/6, then 1 -u² becomes smaller, so 1/(1 -u²) increases, so BD(u)=176/(1 -u²) -96 increases as u increases. 

---------------

Wait, but that would mean that the minimal value is achieved as u approaches 5/6 from above, giving BD(u) approaching 480. However, when u approaches 5/6 from above, the limit is 480. But is that attainable?



---------------

Wait, when u=5/6, tanh s=5/6, but that's exactly the boundary where tanh s=5/6, but in our condition, we need tanh s>5/6, so u must be greater than 5/6. Therefore, the minimal value is approached as u approaches 5/6 from the right, but it's not actually attainable. Hmm, so does that mean that BD² can get arbitrarily close to 480 but never actually reach it?



---------------

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "for all such rhombi", so we need the infimum. The infimum would be 480, but it's not achieved. So the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi would be 480, since BD² can get as close as desired to 480 from above, but never actually be less than 480. Therefore, the answer is 480.



---------------

Wait, but let me confirm this. Let me see if there's another way that BD² can be smaller. Wait, perhaps I made an error in substitution.



---------------

Wait, let me check the calculation again. BD² was found as 176 cosh² s -96. When cosh² s is minimized at 36/11, then BD² is 176*(36/11) -96. Let me compute that again:

176 divided by 11 is 16, so 16*36 is 576. 576 -96 is indeed 480. So that part is correct.

But since u must be greater than 5/6, so cosh s can't be exactly 6/sqrt(11), but can approach it from above. Therefore, BD² can approach 480 but can't be less than that. So the infimum is 480, so the greatest real number less than all BD² is 480. Therefore, the answer is 480.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider another parametrization where BD² can actually attain 480? Let me think again.



---------------

Wait, when u approaches 5/6 from above, s approaches arctanh(5/6), so in that case, the parameter t would approach tanh^{-1}( -5/(6*(5/6)) ) = tanh^{-1}(-1). But tanh^{-1}(-1) is -infinity, so t approaches negative infinity. But in that case, the point A would be (sqrt(20) cosh t, sqrt(24) sinh t). As t approaches -infinity, cosh t ~ e^{-t}/2, sinh t ~ -e^{-t}/2. Therefore, the coordinates of point A would be approaching (0,0) but scaled? 

---------------

Wait, actually, as t approaches -infty, cosh t ~ (e^{-t} + e^{t})/2 ~ e^{-t}/2, and sinh t ~ (e^{-t} - e^{t})/2 ~ -e^{-t}/2. So the coordinates become sqrt(20)*(e^{-t}/2) and sqrt(24)*(-e^{-t}/2). So as t approaches -infty, the point A approaches (0,0), but along a line towards the origin. However, the point must lie on the hyperbola, so as t approaches -infty, the point A approaches the origin but never actually reaches it. 

---------------

Wait, but the hyperbola doesn't pass through the origin. Therefore, the point A can get arbitrarily close to the origin but never actually be there. Therefore, in the limit as s approaches arctanh(5/6) from above, the point A is going to infinity? 

---------------

Wait, no. Wait, when s approaches arctanh(5/6) from above, s is approaching a finite value. 

---------------

Wait, arctanh(5/6) is a finite value. Wait, perhaps I confused the direction.

Wait, when u approaches 5/6 from above, s approaches arctanh(5/6). So s is approaching a finite value, so cosh s approaches 6/sqrt(11), which is a finite value, so the coordinates of point B are approaching (sqrt(20)* (6/sqrt(11)), sqrt(24)* sinh(arctanh(5/6))).



---------------

Wait, let me compute sinh(arctanh(5/6)). Since sinh(arctanh x)=x / sqrt(1 -x²). Let me verify:

Let y=arctanh x,

then tanh y =x,

sinh y =x / sqrt(1 -x²),

since cosh y=1/sqrt(1 -x²),

so sinh y = tanh y * cosh y =x / sqrt(1 -x²).

Therefore, sinh(arctanh(5/6))= (5/6)/sqrt(1 -25/36)= (5/6)/sqrt(11/36)= (5/6)/(sqrt(11)/6)=5/sqrt(11).

Therefore, point B would approach (sqrt(20)*(6/sqrt(11)), sqrt(24)*(5/sqrt(11))).

Similarly, point A would be approaching (sqrt(20) cosh t, sqrt(24) sinh t) where tanh t = -5/(6*(5/6)) = -1.



---------------

Wait, tanh t = -1 implies t approaches -infty, as tanh(-infty)= -1. Therefore, as u approaches 5/6 from above, t approaches -infty, so point A approaches (0,0) as t approaches -infty, but point B approaches a finite point. 

---------------

Wait, but then in the limit, the rhombus would have one vertex approaching the origin, but since the origin is the midpoint, the opposite vertex would go to infinity? Hmm, perhaps this is getting too much into the limit.

But in any case, the minimal BD² approaches 480, but since the limit can't be achieved, BD² can be made arbitrarily close to 480, so the infimum is 480, so the answer is 480.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I need to check another approach. Let me think of the problem in terms of coordinates.

Suppose that points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, with diagonals intersecting at the origin. Let me consider the coordinates of the points as (a,b), (-a,-b), (c,d), (-c,-d). The diagonals are AC and BD. The diagonals are perpendicular, so (a c + b d)=0. All points lie on the hyperbola, so a²/20 - b²/24 =1 and c²/20 -d²/24=1.

We need to minimize BD² =4(c² +d²).

We can consider variables a,b,c,d with those constraints. Let me try to use Lagrange multipliers here. Let me consider the function to minimize f(c,d)=c² +d², subject to the hyperbola constraint g(c,d)=c²/20 -d²/24 -1=0, and also the condition a c +b d=0, but a and b are variables on their own hyperbola.

Hmm, this is getting complex with multiple variables. Maybe we can express a and b in terms of c and d using the perpendicularity condition.

From a c + b d =0 ⇒ a c = -b d ⇒ a = (-b d)/c, assuming c≠0.

Then, substitute into the hyperbola equation for point A:

a²/20 - b²/24=1 ⇒ [ (b² d²)/(c²) ] /20 - b²/24 =1,

Multiply through by 20*24*c² to eliminate denominators:

24 c²*(b² d²) -20*20* c² *b² =20*24 c²,

Hmm, this is getting messy. Let me see:

Let me rearrange the equation:

(b² d²)/(20 c²) - (b²)/24 =1,

Factor out b²:

b² [ (d²)/(20 c²) -1/24 ] =1,

Therefore,

b² = 1 / [ (d²)/(20 c²) -1/24 ]

Hmm, not sure if helpful.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps set variables such that we can use substitution. Let me consider variables c and d, and express a and b in terms of them. Since a c +b d =0, then a = - (b d)/c. Substitute into the hyperbola equation for point A:

( a² )/20 - (b²)/24 =1,

Substitute a:

[ (b² d²)/(c²) ] /20 - (b²)/24 =1,

Factor b²:

b² [ (d²)/(20 c²) -1/24 ] =1,

So,

b² = 1 / [ (d²)/(20 c²) -1/24 ]

Similarly, since point B is on the hyperbola, we have c²/20 -d²/24 =1.

Let me denote equation for point B: c²/20 -d²/24 =1 ⇒ let me write that as:

Multiply by 120: 6 c² -5 d² =120 ⇒ 6c² -5d²=120.

So, perhaps express d² from here: d²=(6c² -120)/5.

Now, plug that into the expression for b²:

First, let me compute (d²)/(20 c²) -1/24,

= [ (6c² -120)/5 ] / (20c²) -1/24,

= (6c² -120)/(100 c²) -1/24,

= [ (6c² -120) *24 -100 c² ] / (2400 c² )



---------------

Wait, perhaps better to compute step by step:

First term: (d²)/(20c²)= [(6c² -120)/5]/(20c²)= (6c² -120)/(100 c²)= [6(c² -20)]/(100c²)= 3(c² -20)/(50c²)

Second term: -1/24,

Therefore, the entire expression inside the brackets:

3(c² -20)/(50c²) -1/24 = [ 3(c² -20)*24 -50c² *1 ] / (50c² *24)



---------------

Wait, perhaps instead, let me compute numerator:

Let me write:

3(c² -20)/(50c²) -1/24 = [ (3(c² -20) *24) -50c² *1 ] / (50c² *24)



---------------

Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, let me just denote variables as follows.

Let me let c be a variable, then d²=(6c² -120)/5.

Then, from the expression for b²:

b² = 1/[ (d²)/(20 c²) -1/24 ]

Substitute d²:

=1/[ ( (6c² -120)/5 )/(20c²) -1/24 ]

Compute first term inside denominator:

(6c² -120)/(5*20c²)= (6c² -120)/(100c²)= [6(c² -20)]/(100c²)= [3(c² -20)]/(50c²)

Second term is -1/24,

So denominator is [3(c² -20)/(50c²) -1/24]

Let me combine these terms:

Let me find a common denominator for the two terms. The denominators are 50c² and 24. Let me compute LCM of 50 and24, which is 600.

Thus,

3(c² -20)/(50c²)= [3(c² -20)*12]/(600c²)= [36(c² -20)]/(600c²)

and -1/24= -25/(600)



---------------

Wait, actually, no, the denominators are 50c² and 24. To combine over common denominator 600c²:

First term: 3(c² -20)/(50c²)= [3(c² -20)*12]/600c²= [36(c² -20)]/(600c²)

Second term: -1/24= -25c²/(600c²)



---------------

Wait, actually, no. Wait, to combine fractions with denominators 50c² and 24, the common denominator is 600c².

So:

First term becomes 3(c² -20)/50c² * (12/12)= 36(c² -20)/600c²,

Second term: -1/24 = - (25c²)/600c²,



---------------

Wait, no, that's not quite right. To express -1/24 as over denominator 600c²,

Multiply numerator and denominator by 25c²:

-1/24 = - (25c²)/(24 *25c²)= -25c²/(600c²). 

---------------

Wait, but that would mean the second term is -25c²/(600c²). But that seems incorrect because the second term was originally -1/24, independent of c². Hmm, perhaps this approach is not the best.



---------------

Alternatively, let me compute the denominator:

Let me denote D = 3(c² -20)/(50c²) -1/24,

Let me write D = [3(c² -20)*24 -50c²*1 ] / (50c² *24)

Compute numerator:

3*24(c² -20) -50c² =72(c² -20) -50c² =72c² -1440 -50c²=22c² -1440

Thus, D= (22c² -1440)/(50c² *24)

Therefore,

b² =1/D = (50c² *24)/(22c² -1440)

Simplify numerator and denominator:

50*24=1200,

Denominator: 22c² -1440=22(c² - 1440/22)=22(c² - 65.454...)

Thus,

b²= (1200 c²)/(22c² -1440)= (600 c²)/(11c² -720)

Therefore, b² must be positive, so denominator must be positive:

11c² -720 >0 ⇒ c²>720/11≈65.4545...

Therefore, c² must be greater than 720/11.

Now, since we are trying to minimize c² +d²,

and d²=(6c² -120)/5,

so c² +d²= c² + (6c² -120)/5= (5c² +6c² -120)/5= (11c² -120)/5,

Thus, BD²=4*(11c² -120)/5,

so we need to minimize BD²= (44c² -480)/5,

which is equivalent to minimizing c².

Therefore, to minimize BD², we need to minimize c², which must be greater than 720/11≈65.4545...

Therefore, the minimal c² is just over 720/11, so the minimal BD² approaches (44*(720/11) -480)/5.



---------------

Wait, let me compute that:

44*(720/11)= 4*720=2880,

2880 -480=2400,

2400/5=480,

So the minimal BD² approaches 480 as c² approaches 720/11 from above, which matches our previous result.

Therefore, the infimum of BD² is indeed 480, so the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 480.

Therefore, the answer is 480.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{480}


Given the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), we need to find the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all rhombuses \(ABCD\) inscribed in the hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin.

1. **Properties of the Rhombus**:
   - The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) bisect each other at the origin and are perpendicular.
   - The vertices \(A, B, C, D\) are such that \(A = (a, b)\), \(C = (-a, -b)\), \(B = (c, d)\), and \(D = (-c, -d)\).

2. **Conditions**:
   - The points lie on the hyperbola: \(\frac{a^2}{20} - \frac{b^2}{24} = 1\) and \(\frac{c^2}{20} - \frac{d^2}{24} = 1\).
   - The diagonals are perpendicular: \(ac + bd = 0\).

3. **Expression for \(BD^2\)**:
   - \(BD^2 = 4(c^2 + d^2)\).

4. **Parametrization and Constraints**:
   - Using hyperbola parametrization, we express \(c\) and \(d\) in terms of parameters and derive the relationship between them.
   - The condition \(ac + bd = 0\) translates to \(20 \cosh t \cosh s + 24 \sinh t \sinh s = 0\), leading to \(\tanh t \tanh s = -\frac{5}{6}\).

5. **Minimizing \(BD^2\)**:
   - Express \(BD^2\) in terms of \(c\) and \(d\) using the hyperbola equation and the constraint.
   - Convert the problem into minimizing \(c^2 + d^2\) under the given constraints.
   - Using substitution and calculus, it is found that the minimal value of \(c^2 + d^2\) approaches \(\frac{36}{11}\) when \(c\) approaches \(\frac{6}{\sqrt{11}}\).

6. **Result**:
   - The minimal value of \(BD^2\) approaches \(480\) as the parameters approach their limits, making \(480\) the infimum.

Thus, the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi is \(\boxed{480}\).
