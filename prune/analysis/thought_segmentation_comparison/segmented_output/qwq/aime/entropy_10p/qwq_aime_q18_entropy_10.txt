Okay, so I need to find AB times AC in triangle ABC where the circumradius is 13, the inradius is 6, and IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm, let's start by recalling some properties related to circumcenters, incenters, and the

---------------

 relationships between these elements.

First, the circumradius R is given as 13, so the circumcircle has radius 13. The inradius r is 6. The triangle

---------------

 has an incenter I and circumcenter O, and the line IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems like a key condition here. I need to connect

---------------

 these pieces of information somehow.

Let me remember some formulas related to triangle centers. The distance between the incenter and circumcenter can

---------------

 be given by the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Wait, is that right? Wait, no, that

---------------

's the formula for the distance between the incenter and centroid, maybe? Wait, no, actually, the formula for OI² is different. Let me recall the

---------------

 formula correctly. I think it's OI² = R² - 2Rr, where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Is

---------------

 that correct? Hmm, let me verify that. Maybe I should check the formula for the distance between incenter and circumradius.

Yes, actually, the formula for the distance between the incenter (I) and circumcenter (O) in a triangle is given

---------------

 by:

OI² = R² - 2Rr

So that's OI squared equals R squared minus 2 times R times r. Okay

---------------

, so that's a key formula here. But in this problem, we also have that IA is perpendicular to OI. So maybe

---------------

 we can use some coordinate geometry here?

Alternatively, maybe use vectors or trigonometric identities. Let me think.

Since IA is perpendicular to OI, that implies

---------------

 that the vector from I to A is perpendicular to the vector from O to I. Wait, actually, IA is perpendicular to OI, so the line IA is perpendicular to the line OI. So the

---------------

 direction of IA is perpendicular to the direction of OI. Hmm, so maybe we can use some coordinate system here.

Let me try setting up coordinates. Let me place the circumcenter O at the origin (0,0). Let me denote

---------------

 coordinates such that point A is somewhere on the circumcircle, so OA = R = 13. Let me denote coordinates for

---------------

 points A, B, C such that O is at (0,0). Let me suppose that point I is at some coordinates (x, y), then

---------------

 OI is the vector from O to I, which is (x, y). The line IA is from point I (x,y) to point A, which is on

---------------

 the circumcircle. The condition is that IA is perpendicular to OI, so the vector IA · vector OI = 0.

Vector

---------------

 IA is (A_x - x, A_y - y). Vector OI is (x, y). Their dot product should be zero:

(A_x - x)x + (A_y - y)y = 0

Which simplifies to:

A_x x + A_y y - x² - y² = 0

But OA is the radius, so OA squared is 13², so A_x² + A_y² = 169.

Therefore

---------------

, substituting that into the previous equation:

(A_x x + A_y y) - (x² + y²) = 0

But since A_x² + A_y² = 169, maybe

---------------

 I can express A_x x + A_y y in terms of something else. Wait, that term A_x x + A_y y is the dot product of vectors OA and OI, right? Because OA is (A_x, A_y) and OI is (x, y). So their dot product is OA · OI = |OA||OI|cosθ, where θ is the angle between them. Hmm

---------------

, not sure if that helps yet.

Alternatively, since OA · OI = A_x x + A_y y, so substit

---------------

uting back into the equation:

OA · OI - |OI|² = 0

So OA · OI = |OI|²

Hmm, interesting

---------------

. Let me denote |OI| as d. Then, since OI squared is R² - 2Rr, as

---------------

 per the formula above. Wait, so OI² = R² - 2Rr = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. Therefore, OI is sqrt(13). Wait, is

---------------

 that right?

Wait, let me check that again. If OI² = R² - 2Rr, then substit

---------------

uting R = 13 and r = 6:

OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI is sqrt(13). Hmm

---------------

, okay. So OI is sqrt(13). Therefore, the equation above says OA · OI = |OI|² = 13. So

---------------

 OA · OI = 13.

But OA is a vector of length 13, and OI is a vector of length sqrt(13). Therefore, their dot product is 13, so:



---------------

OA · OI = |OA||OI|cosθ = 13 * sqrt(13) * cosθ = 13

Therefore, cosθ = 13 / (13 * sqrt(13)) ) = 1/sqrt(13)

So

---------------

 the angle between OA and OI is arccos(1/sqrt(13)). Hmm, maybe not immediately helpful, but perhaps useful

---------------

 later.

Alternatively, let's see if we can express coordinates in such a way to make this easier. Let me consider placing point A at (13, 0) for

---------------

 simplicity. Then OA is along the x-axis. Then O is at (0,0), so point A is (13, 0). Then, since

---------------

 IA is perpendicular to OI, let's see.

Let me denote the coordinates of I as (h, k). Then, the

---------------

 vector OI is (h, k). The vector IA is (13 - h, 0 - k). Their dot product should be zero:

(13 - h)h + (0 - k)k = 0

Which

---------------

 simplifies to:

13h - h² - k² = 0

So 13h = h² + k²

But also, we

---------------

 know from the formula that OI² = h² + k² = 13, so substituting that into the equation:

13h = 13 => h = 1

Ah! That's a

---------------

 good step. Since OI squared is h² + k² =13, so substituting into 13h = h² + k², we

---------------

 get 13h = 13 => h =1. Therefore, the x-coordinate of the incenter I is 1, so the coordinates of I are (1, k), and since h² + k² =13, then k² =13 -1 =12, so k= ±2*sqrt(3). Hmm, so the incenter is at (1, 2√3) or (1, -2√3). Since the triangle can be oriented either way, but probably

---------------

 doesn't matter because distances are squared. Let's just take k positive, so (1, 2√3).

So now

---------------

, we know coordinates of I as (1, 2√3). Now, since I is the incenter, we can recall that the inradius is 6, so the inradius formula is area =

---------------

 r*s, where s is the semiperimeter. Also, the coordinates of the incenter can be given in terms of the triangle's sides. Hmm

---------------

, but maybe coordinate geometry can help here.

Alternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities. Let me recall that in any triangle, the coordinates of the incenter can be written as ( (aA_x + bB_x + cC_x)/(a+b+c), similarly for y-coordinates ), but since I placed O at (0,0) and A at (13,0), maybe we

---------------

 can use barycentric coordinates or something else.

Alternatively, let me think of the formula for the inradius coordinates. Wait

---------------

, in coordinate geometry, if we have coordinates for the vertices, then the incenter can be found as a weighted average. But since

---------------

 I have placed O at (0,0) and A at (13,0), perhaps I can denote coordinates for B and C as points on the circumcircle as

---------------

 well, so their coordinates must satisfy x² + y² =13². But this might get complicated with too many variables.

Alternatively, perhaps use

---------------

 trigonometric relationships. Let me denote angles of the triangle. Let me denote angle at A as α, B as β, C as γ. Then

---------------

, in triangle ABC, the inradius r = 6, circumradius R =13. We need to find AB * AC. Let me note that AB * AC is equal to c * b, where in standard notation, a is BC, b is AC, c is AB. So,

---------------

 need to find b*c.

Alternatively, using formulas involving R and r. Let me recall some formulas:

In any triangle,

r = (Area)/s,

where s is the semiperimeter,

and R = (a b c)/(4 Area).

Also, there's the formula involving

---------------

 the distance between inradius and circumradius: OI² = R(R - 2r), which we already used.

Additionally

---------------

, perhaps the formula that connects the sides with the inradius and circumradius? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe using

---------------

 trigonometric identities involving the angles.

Alternatively, since IA is perpendicular to OI, perhaps there is a relation in terms of angles.

Wait, in

---------------

 the coordinate system I set up earlier, with O at (0,0), A at (13,0), and I at (1, 2√3). So

---------------

, perhaps we can find coordinates for B and C?

Alternatively, maybe use the fact that the inradius is 6, so the area of the triangle is r*s =6s, where s is the semiperimeter.

Also, the area can be written as (a b c)/(4R) = (a b c)/52. Therefore, 

---------------

6s = (a b c)/52 => a b c = 312 s.

Hmm, but not

---------------

 sure how helpful that is yet. Alternatively, maybe use coordinates to find equations for the inradius.

Alternatively, since we have coordinates of I, maybe

---------------

 use the formula for the inradius coordinates in terms of the triangle's vertices. Let me recall that the coordinates of the incenter are given by ( (aA_x + bB_x + cC_x)/(a+b+c), (aA_y + bB_y + cC_y)/(a+b+c) ), where a, b, c are the lengths of the sides opposite to angles A, B, C respectively. Wait

---------------

, but in standard notation, a is BC, b is AC, c is AB.

Given that, since we placed point A at (13,0), and

---------------

 O at (0,0), points B and C are somewhere on the circle x² + y² =169. Let me denote coordinates for B as (x1, y1) and C as (x2, y2). Then, the incenter coordinates would be:

( (a*13 + b*x1 + c*x2 ) / (a + b + c), (a*0 + b*y1 + c*y2 ) / (a + b + c) ) = (1, 2√3)

So,



---------------

(13a + b x1 + c x2)/(a + b + c) = 1,

and

(b y1 + c y2)/(a + b + c) = 2√3.

Hmm, this seems quite

---------------

 involved because we have multiple variables here. Maybe this approach is too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps use vector approaches. Let me think again

---------------

.

We know that IA is perpendicular to OI. Since O is the circumcenter, OA is a radius vector, and IA is from

---------------

 incenter to vertex A. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe there is a relation in terms of vectors.

Alternatively, since

---------------

 OI squared is 13, and IA is perpendicular to OI, so maybe use Pythagoras in triangle OIA?

Wait, in

---------------

 triangle OIA, if IA is perpendicular to OI, then triangle OIA is a right triangle with right angle at A? Wait no, because IA is perpendicular to OI, so the right angle is at I? Wait, the

---------------

 lines IA and OI are perpendicular, so the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees, so the triangle OIA has a right angle at I.

Ah

---------------

! So triangle OIA is right-angled at I. Therefore, by Pythagoras:

OI² + IA² = OA²

Wait, no

---------------

. Wait, in a right-angled triangle, the sum of squares of the legs equals the hypotenuse squared. If the right angle is at I, then legs are OI and IA, so:

OI² + IA² = OA²

But

---------------

 OA is the circumradius, which is 13, so OA² = 169. OI squared is 13, so:

13 + IA² = 169 => IA² = 156 => IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). Hmm, so

---------------

 IA is 2√39.

Hmm, so that gives us IA = 2√39. Maybe this is useful?

We

---------------

 can recall that in a triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles. Let me recall the formula for the length of IA. In triangle ABC, the distance from the incenter I to vertex A is given by:

IA = \sqrt{r^2 + \left( s - a \right)^2 }

where r is the inradius, s is the semiperimeter, and a is the side opposite angle A (i.e., BC). Wait

---------------

, let me confirm that formula. Hmm, yes, actually, the formula for the distance from the incenter to vertex A is:

IA = \frac{r}{\sin \frac{A}{2}}

Alternatively, another

---------------

 formula: IA = \sqrt{r^2 + \left( s - a \right)^2 }

Let me verify this

---------------

 formula. Let me consider the inradius, which is at distance r from each side, and the incenter is located at distances s - a, s - b, s - c from the sides opposite to A, B, C respectively. Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the coordinates can be considered in terms of the triangle's angles.

Alternatively, using trigonometry, in the angle bisector. The distance from I to A can be found by considering the angle bisector. In

---------------

 triangle A, the inradius is located along the angle bisector, and the distance from I to A can be expressed in terms of the angle at A and the inradius.

Alternatively

---------------

, the formula IA = \frac{r}{\sin \frac{A}{2}} is correct. Let me see

---------------

:

In the triangle formed by vertex A, the incenter I, and the point where the incircle touches side BC. Let me denote that touch point as D. Then, in triangle AID, angle at I is 90°, since the inradius is perpendicular to the side. The angle at A is half of angle A, since the incenter lies on the angle bisector. Therefore, in triangle AID:

sin( A/2 ) = r / IA => IA = r / sin( A/2 )

Yes, that's

---------------

 correct. So IA = r / sin( A/2 ). Therefore, IA = 6 / sin( A/2 ). Earlier

---------------

, we found IA is 2√39, so:

6 / sin( A/2 ) = 2√39 => sin( A/2 ) = 6 / (2√39 ) = 3 / √39 = 3 / (√13 * √3) ) = √3 / √13 =

---------------

 √(3/13)

Hmm, so sin( A/2 ) = sqrt(3/13). Let me compute

---------------

 cos( A/2 ) using the identity sin² + cos² =1, so cos( A/2 ) = sqrt(1 - 3/13 ) = sqrt(10/13).



---------------

Therefore, cos( A/2 ) = sqrt(10/13). Hmm.

Alternatively, using the formula for IA squared

---------------

:

IA² = r² + (s - a)^2. Wait, if that's the formula, then:

IA² = 6² + (s - a)^2 = 36 + (s - a)^2 = 156 (

---------------

since IA squared is 156)

Therefore, (s - a)^2 = 156 - 36 = 120 => s - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30). Hmm, but

---------------

 s is the semiperimeter, so s = (a + b + c)/2, so s - a = ( -a + b + c)/2.

Hmm

---------------

, so ( ( -a + b + c ) / 2 )² = 120 => ( -a + b + c )² = 480.

Hmm

---------------

, not sure yet. Maybe we can get another equation from this.

Alternatively, since we have angle A's half-angle, perhaps we

---------------

 can relate this to sides via the Law of Sines or Cosines.

In triangle ABC, the Law of Sines says that a / sin A = 2R = 26. Wait

---------------

, since the circumradius R is 13, so 2R =26. So a = 26 sin A. Similarly, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.

Hmm

---------------

, so sides can be expressed in terms of angles. Let me denote angle at A as α, so angle A = α. Then, a

---------------

 = BC = 26 sin α, b = AC = 26 sin B, c = AB = 26 sin C.

Also

---------------

, since the sum of angles is π, α + B + C = π.

Also, the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = 13 ( sin α + sin B + sin C ). Hmm, but

---------------

 this might get complicated.

Alternatively, let's use the formula for the inradius:

r = (Area)/s = 6.

The area can also be written as (a b c)/(4R) = (a b c)/52. So,

6 = (a b c)/(52 s)

---------------

 => 6 *52 s = a b c => a b c = 312 s.

Hmm, but

---------------

 again, multiple variables here.

Alternatively, let me recall that in any triangle,

cos A = (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc)

So

---------------

 if I can express angle A in terms of the half-angle, since we know sin(A/2) and cos(A/2).

We

---------------

 have:

sin(A/2) = sqrt( (1 - cos A)/2 ) = sqrt(3/13 )



---------------

Therefore,

(1 - cos A)/2 = 3/13 => 1 - cos A = 6/13 => cos A = 1 - 6/13 = 7/13.

So cos A = 7/13. Therefore, angle A has cosine 7/13, so sin

---------------

 A = sqrt(1 - (49/169)) = sqrt(120/169) = (2*sqrt(30))/13.

Thus

---------------

, sin A = 2√30 /13. Then, using the Law of Sines,

a = 26 sin A = 26*(2√30)/13 = 4√30.

So side a (BC) is 4√30. Okay

---------------

, that's a value. Let me note that down: BC = 4√30.

Now, since we need to find AB * AC, which are sides c and b respectively (since in standard notation, a is BC, b is AC, c is AB). So need

---------------

 to find b*c.

Hmm, perhaps we can find expressions for b and c in terms of angles B and C, but

---------------

 we need more relations.

Alternatively, since we know cos A =7/13, and using the Law of Cosines:

cos A = (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc) =7/13

We can

---------------

 write:

(b² + c² - (4√30)^2 ) / (2bc) =7/13

Compute

---------------

 (4√30)^2 =16*30=480. So,

(b² + c² -480)/(2bc)=7/13

Cross multiplying:

13(b² + c² -480) =14 bc

So

---------------

,

13b² +13c² -14 bc = 13*480

Hmm, 

---------------

13*480 is 6240. So,

13b² +13c² -14 bc =6240

Hmm, that

---------------

's one equation involving b and c.

We need another equation. Let's see. Since the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2, and we

---------------

 also have the inradius formula:

r = Area / s => 6 = Area / s => Area =6s

Also, Area can be expressed as (1/2)bc sin A. Since angle A is known, sin A = 2√30/13.

---------------

 Therefore,

Area = (1/2)*b*c*(2√30/13) = (b c √30)/13

Therefore

---------------

,

(b c √30)/13 =6s => bc√30 =78 s

But s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4√30 + b + c)/2

So,

bc√30 =78*(4√30 + b + c)/2 =39*(4√30 + b + c )

Hmm, so

---------------

:

bc√30 =39*(4√30 + b + c )

Hmm, that's another equation. So now we have two equations:

1) 13b² +13c² -14 bc =6240

2) bc√30 =39*(4√30 + b + c )

This is

---------------

 a system of two equations with variables b and c. This seems complicated, but maybe we can manipulate it.

Alternatively, perhaps we

---------------

 can let x = b and y =c, so equations become:

13x² +13y² -14xy =6240,



---------------

and

xy√30 =39*(4√30 +x + y )

Hmm, let me try to work

---------------

 with equation 2 first.

Equation 2: xy√30 = 39*(4√30 +x + y )

Let me divide both sides by √30:

xy = 39*(4 + (x + y)/√30 )

Hmm, not

---------------

 sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps rearrange equation 2:

xy√30 -39x -39y = 39*4√30

Hmm, so

---------------

:

xy√30 -39x -39y = 156√30

Hmm, perhaps factor terms?



---------------

Alternatively, let me consider introducing variables u = x + y and v = xy. Then, equation 1 can be written in terms of u and v.



---------------

First, note that equation 1 is:

13x² +13y² -14xy =6240.

But x² + y² = (x + y)^2 - 2xy = u² - 2v.

---------------

 Therefore,

13(u² -2v) -14v =6240,

so,

13u² -26v -14v =6240,

which

---------------

 simplifies to:

13u² -40v =6240 => equation A: 13u² -40v =6240.

Equation 2:

---------------

 v√30 -39u =156√30. (since x + y =u, xy =v, so equation

---------------

 2 is v√30 -39u = 156√30 )

So equation B: v√30 -39u =156√30 => v√30 = 39u +156√30 => v = (39u +156√30)/√30 = 39u /√30 +156.

Hmm, so

---------------

 now we can substitute v from equation B into equation A.

From equation B: v = (39u)/√30 + 156.

Pl

---------------

ugging into equation A:

13u² -40*( (39u)/√30 +156 ) =6240

Let

---------------

 me compute each term:

First term:13u².

Second term: -40*(39u)/√30 = - (40*39)/√30 * u =

---------------

 - (1560)/√30 * u

Third term: -40*156 = -6240

Therefore:

13u² - (1560/√30)u -6240 =6240

Bring the 6240 to the right:

13u² - (1560/√30)u = 6240 +6240 =12480

Hmm, this is getting messy

---------------

. Maybe rationalize the denominator?

1560 /√30 can be written as 1560√30 /30 = 52√30. Because 1560 divided by 30 is 52. So,



---------------

1560/√30 =52√30.

Therefore, the equation becomes:

13u² -52√30 u =12480

Hmm, so

---------------

:

13u² -52√30 u -12480 =0

Divide both sides by 13:

u² -4√30 u - 960 =0

So

---------------

 quadratic equation in u:

u² -4√30 u -960 =0

Let me solve this quadratic for u.

Using quadratic formula:

u = [4√30 ± sqrt( (4√30)^2 +4*960 ) ] /2

Compute discriminant:

(4√30)^2 +4*960 = 16*30 + 3840 = 480 + 3840 =4320

sqrt(4320) = sqrt(144*30) =12√30

Therefore,

u = [4√30 ±12√30]/2 = [ (4 ±12)√30 ] /2

So

---------------

 two solutions:

u = (16√30)/2 =8√30,

or u = (-8√30)/2= -4√30.

But since u =x + y =b + c, which are lengths, must be positive. So u=8√30.

Therefore, u =8√30.

Now, substitute

---------------

 back into equation B to find v:

v = (39u)/√30 +156 = (39*8√30)/√30 +156 =39*8 +156= 312 +156= 468.

Therefore, v = xy =b c =468.

Wait, so that

---------------

's the value of b*c, which is exactly what we need to find: AB * AC = c*b = v =468.

Wait

---------------

, so is that the answer? Let me check through the steps again to confirm.

First, we set up the problem with coordinates, found that O

---------------

I squared is 13, then found that IA is 2√39. Then, using the formula IA = r / sin(A/2), found sin(A/2)=3

---------------

/√39=√3/√13, so cos(A/2)=sqrt(10/13). Then, using

---------------

 double-angle formulas, found cos A =7/13, so sin A = 2√30 /13. Then, using

---------------

 Law of Sines, found side a (BC)=4√30. Then, set up equations with Law of Cosines and the area formulas

---------------

, leading to a system of equations in terms of b and c. By substitution, we found that b*c=468. So

---------------

 that's the answer?

Wait, but let me confirm once again with the equations. Let me check if with u=8√30 and v=468, does

---------------

 equation 1 hold?

Equation A:13u² -40v =13*(8√30)^2 -40*468

Compute (8√30)^2 =64*30=1920,



---------------

so 13*1920 =24960,

40*468=18720,

2

---------------

4960 -18720=6240. Which matches the RHS of equation A. So that's correct.

Equ

---------------

ation B: v√30 -39u =468√30 -39*(8√30)=468√30 -312√30=156√30. Which is the

---------------

 RHS of equation B. So that checks out.

Therefore, the solution is correct. Therefore, AB * AC = bc =v=468. So the answer is 468.

Wait, but before

---------------

 I conclude, let me check if there's any step where I might have miscalculated. For example, when I calculated

---------------

 IA squared from the right triangle OIA, which gave me OI squared plus IA squared equals OA squared. OI squared was 13, OA squared 169, so IA squared is 156. Then using

---------------

 IA = r / sin(A/2), so 156 = (6)^2 / sin²(A/2). Wait, actually

---------------

, IA squared is (r / sin(A/2))², so 156 = 36 / sin²(A/2) => sin²(A/2)=36/156=3/13, so sin(A/2)=√(3/13). Which is consistent

---------------

 with earlier steps. So that's okay.

Also, when using the formula IA squared = r² + (s -a)^2, so

---------------

 156 = 36 + (s -a)^2 => (s -a)^2 =120 => s -a = 2*sqrt(30). Then

---------------

, s = (a +b +c)/2, so ( (a +b +c)/2 -a ) = ( -a +b +c )/2 = s

---------------

 -a =2√30. So (-a +b +c)=4√30. Since a is 4√30, so substit

---------------

uting, (-4√30 +b +c)=4√30 => b +c=8√30. Which matches the value of u=

---------------

8√30. So that's consistent. Then, since v=bc=468, so that's the

---------------

 product. So all steps check out.

Therefore, the answer should be 468. Let me just confirm once again if

---------------

 the problem asks for AB multiplied by AC. Since in standard notation, AB is side c and AC is side b, so yes, their product is bc=468. So

---------------

 I think that's correct.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{468}


Given triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \), where \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), circumradius \( R = 13 \), and inradius \( r = 6 \). We need to find \( AB \cdot AC \).

1. **Distance between Incenter and Circumcenter**:
   Using the formula \( OI^2 = R(R - 2r) \):
   \[
   OI^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13 \implies OI = \sqrt{13}
   \]

2. **Right Triangle \( \triangle OIA \)**:
   Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), \( \triangle OIA \) is a right triangle with right angle at \( I \). Applying Pythagoras theorem:
   \[
   OI^2 + IA^2 = OA^2 \implies 13 + IA^2 = 13^2 \implies IA^2 = 169 - 13 = 156 \implies IA = 2\sqrt{39}
   \]

3. **Using In

---------------

radius and Half-Angle Formula**:
   The distance \( IA \) can be expressed as \( \frac{r}{\sin(\frac{A}{2})} \):
   \[
   2\sqrt{39} = \frac{6}{\sin(\frac{A}{2})} \implies \sin\left(\frac{A}{2}\right) = \frac{6}{2\sqrt{39}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{39}} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{13}}
   \]
   Using the identity \( \cos^2\left(\frac{A}{2}\right) = 1 - \sin^2\left(\frac{A}{2}\right) \):
   \[
   \cos\left(\frac{A}{2}\right) = \sqrt{1 - \frac{3}{13}} = \sqrt{\frac{10}{13}}
   \]

4. **Calcul

---------------

ating \( \cos A \) and \( \sin A \)**:
   \[
   \cos A = 2\cos^2\left(\frac{A}{2}\right) - 1 = 2 \cdot \frac{10}{13} - 1 = \frac{20}{13} - 1 = \frac{7}{13}
   \]
   \[
   \sin A = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 A} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{7}{13}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{120}{169}} = \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13}
   \]

5. **Law of Sines**:
   \[
   a = BC = 2R \sin A = 26 \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13} = 4\sqrt{30}
   \]

6. **Using

---------------

 Law of Cosines and Area**:
   \[
   \cos A = \frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc} \implies \frac{7}{13} = \frac{b^2 + c^2 - 480}{2bc}
   \]
   \[
   13(b^2 + c^2 - 480) = 14bc \implies 13b^2 + 13c^2 - 14bc = 6240
   \]
   Using

---------------

 semiperimeter \( s \) and area:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2}bc \sin A = \frac{bc \sqrt{30}}{13} = 6s \implies bc\sqrt{30} = 78s
   \]
   Solving the system of equations, we find:
   \[
   b + c = 8\sqrt{30} \quad \text{and} \quad bc = 468
   \]

Thus, the product \( AB \cdot AC = bc = \boxed{468} \).<|im_end|>
