Okay, so I have this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that

---------------

 sounds a bit intimidating at first, but maybe I can break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when dealing with products and

---------------

 cyclotomic polynomials. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, it satisfies ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial over the integers is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial. But I

---------------

'm not sure yet how that connects here.

The product given is over all k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me see if I can rewrite each term to make it more manageable. Let's look at the term inside the product:

2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}

Hmm, maybe factor out a 2? Wait, but

---------------

 the terms have different powers. Alternatively, maybe notice that ω^{2k} is (ω^k)^2. Let me set z = ω^k for each term. Then each term becomes 2 - 2z + z². So the product becomes the product over all z (since ω^k runs through all 13th roots of unity except 1, but wait

---------------

, actually when k=0, ω^0 = 1, so z would be 1 as well. Wait

---------------

, but the problem states ω ≠ 1, but the product is over k from 0 to 12, so that

---------------

 includes ω^0=1. Maybe the problem just specifies ω is a primitive root? Not sure. Anyway, perhaps

---------------

 the key is that the product is over all 13th roots of unity, since ω is a primitive 13th root, then

---------------

 ω^k for k=0 to 12 gives all the roots. So maybe the product is over all 13th roots of unity z

---------------

 of (2 - 2z + z²). But let me confirm that.

Wait, the problem says "Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity",

---------------

 but then the product is over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Since ω is a primitive 13th root, then ω^k for k=0,...,12 are

---------------

 all distinct roots of unity. So the product is indeed over all 13th roots of unity (including 1).

---------------

 So maybe the problem just says ω ≠1 to clarify that it's a primitive root? Not sure, but maybe that

---------------

's just part of the problem statement.

So, proceeding, the product is over all 13th roots of unity z of (2 - 2z + z²). Let

---------------

 me denote this product as P. So P = product_{z^{13}=1} (2 - 2z + z²). Maybe

---------------

 I can relate this product to some known polynomial evaluated at certain points?

I recall that products over roots of unity can sometimes be expressed

---------------

 using cyclotomic polynomials. The cyclotomic polynomial Φ_n(x) is the minimal polynomial whose roots are the primitive nth roots of unity. Since we're dealing with all 13th roots of unity, and

---------------

 13 is prime, all roots except 1 are primitive. So Φ_13(x) is the minimal polynomial for primitive

---------------

 13th roots, and it has degree 12. But our product is over all 13 roots, so maybe

---------------

 I need to consider (x^13 -1) which factors into (x -1)Φ_13(x).

Alternatively, perhaps the

---------------

 product P can be related to evaluating some polynomial at x=2 or something like that. Let me think. Let me consider

---------------

 that if I have a polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity, which is x^13 - 1. So if I can write the product as something

---------------

 involving evaluating a polynomial at specific points.

Alternatively, note that each term in the product is 2 - 2z + z². Let me rearr

---------------

ange that: z² - 2z + 2. So each term is z² - 2z + 2. Wait, so

---------------

 P is the product over all 13th roots of unity z of (z² - 2z + 2).

Hmm, so maybe

---------------

 I can write this as the product over z of (z² - 2z + 2). To compute this product, perhaps consider

---------------

 that if I have a polynomial Q(z) such that Q(z) = z^13 -1, then the product over all roots z of Q(z) of some function f(z) can be related

---------------

 to the resultant or something else. Alternatively, maybe consider that the product over (z - a_i) is the polynomial, so perhaps

---------------

 manipulate the terms into a form that can be expressed as another polynomial evaluated at specific points.

Alternatively, perhaps factor the quadratic term

---------------

. Let me see: z² - 2z + 2 can be written as (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)), since the roots are 1 ± i. So

---------------

 then the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)). So

---------------

 that would be the product over all 13th roots of unity of (z - (1 + i)) multiplied by the product over all 13th roots of unity of (z - (1 - i)). 

Therefore, P = [Product_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1 + i))] × [Product_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1 - i))].

But the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z - a) is just the value of the polynomial x^13 - 1 evaluated at a, right? Because if you have a polynomial f

---------------

(z) = Product_{roots z_j} (z - z_j), then f(a) = Product_{z_j} (a - z_j). Wait, actually, if

---------------

 f(z) = z^13 -1, then f(a) = a^13 -1 = Product_{z^{13}=1} (a - z). Therefore, the product over z^{13}=1 of (z - a) would be (-1)^13 times the product over (a - z), so that would be - (a^13 -1). Wait

---------------

, let me check:

Let me consider f(z) = z^13 -1. Then f(a) = Product_{z^{13}=1} (a - z). Therefore, the product over (a - z) is a^13 -1, so the product over (z - a) would be (-1)^{13} Product

---------------

_{z} (a - z) = - (a^13 -1). Since 13 is odd, (-1)^13 = -1. Therefore,

Product_{z^{13}=1} (z - a) = - (a^13 -1). 

Therefore, in

---------------

 our case, the first product (over z of (z - (1 + i))) is equal to -[(1 + i)^13 -1], and similarly the second product (over z of (z - (1 - i))) is equal to -[(1 - i)^13 -1]. 

Therefore, P = [ - ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) ] × [ - ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ] = [ ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ] multiplied

---------------

 by (-1)^2 = 1. So P = [ ( (1 + i)^13 -1 )( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ].

Hmm

---------------

, so now I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, subtract 1 from each, multiply them together, and then take the product.

---------------

 Let me compute (1 + i)^n first. Since 1 + i is a complex number, perhaps using polar form would help here. 

The

---------------

 modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and its angle (argument) is π/4 radians. Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13*(π/4)}. Let me compute that:



---------------

First, [sqrt(2)]^13 = (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).

The angle is 13*(π/4). Let me compute 13*(π/4) modulo 2π.

---------------

 13 divided by 8 (since 2π/(π/4)=8) gives 13 mod 8 = 5, so 5*(π/4). So angle is 5π/4. Therefore

---------------

, e^{i*5π/4} = cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2. 

Thus, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ] 

Let me compute this step by step. First

---------------

, multiply 64*sqrt(2) with each term inside the brackets:

First term: 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (- (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 ) = 64*(-2/2) = 64*(-1) = -64

Second term: 64*sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = same as above but times i, so -64i.

Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i. 

Similarly, let's compute (1 - i)^13. 

First

---------------

, the modulus is also sqrt(2), and the angle is -π/4 (since 1 - i is in the fourth quadrant). So (

---------------

1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i*(-13π/4)}. 

Again, angle

---------------

: -13π/4. Let's compute this modulo 2π. Adding 4π (since 2π is 8π/4) to -13π/4 gives (-13π/4 + 8π/4) = (-5π/4). Alternatively

---------------

, -13π/4 is equivalent to -13π/4 + 4π = (-13π +16π)/4 = 3π/4?

---------------

 Wait, perhaps better to compute as follows: 

The angle -13π/4 can be expressed as adding multiples of 2π until it's within 0 to 2π. Let me add 4π (which is 16π/4):

-13π/4 + 16π/4 = 3π/4. So

---------------

 the angle is 3π/4. Wait, but the direction is different. Wait, actually, the angle for (1 - i) is -π/4, so raising

---------------

 it to the 13th power gives angle 13*(-π/4) = -13π/4. To get

---------------

 this in terms of positive angle, add 4π (since 4π = 16π/4):

-13π/4 + 16π/4 = 3π/4. Therefore, the angle is 3π/4. Wait

---------------

, but 3π/4 is in the second quadrant. But (1 - i)^13, since the original angle is -π/4, after

---------------

 13 times, the angle is -13π/4, which is equivalent to 3π/4 (

---------------

since adding 4π gives 3π/4). Therefore, the direction is 3π/4, so the complex

---------------

 number is cos(3π/4) + i sin(3π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.

Therefore, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ]

Again

---------------

, compute each term:

First term: 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = same as before, -64

Second term: 64*sqrt(2)*(i sqrt(2)/2) = 64i



---------------

Therefore, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i

So now, going back to the expression

---------------

 for P:

P = [ ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ]

First

---------------

 compute each term inside the brackets:

(1 + i)^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i

(1 - i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i

Multiply these two complex numbers:

(-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) 

This is of the form (a - b)(a + b) where a = -65, b =64i? Wait, no, actually,

---------------

 it's ( -65 -64i )*( -65 +64i )

Let me compute it as

---------------

:

Let me denote (a + b)(a - b) where a = -65, b =64i?

---------------

 Wait, no, actually, (x + y)(x - y) is x² - y², but here the

---------------

 terms are different. Let me see:

Let me compute the product step by step:

First, multiply the first terms: (-65)(-65) = 4225

Then, outer: (-65)(64i) = -4160i

Inner: (-64i)(-65) = +4160i

Last: (-64i)(64i) = -4096 i² = -4096*(-1) = +4096

So

---------------

 adding all terms:

4225 -4160i +4160i +4096

The -4160i and +4160i cancel out, leaving 4225 + 4096 = 8321

Therefore, the product is

---------------

 8321. So P = 8321.

Wait, hold on. Wait, but let me confirm that

---------------

 again:

Wait, the first term: (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i). Let me use

---------------

 the formula (a + b)(a - b) where a = -65, and b =64i. Wait, no

---------------

: actually, the terms are ( -65 -64i ) and ( -65 +64i ), so if

---------------

 I factor out the negative sign from the first term's second part, it would be:

Let me write it as [ -65 -64i ][ -65 +64i ] = [ (-65) + (-64i) ] [ (-65) + 64i ]

Let

---------------

 me set a = -65, b =64i. Then it's (a + b)(a - b) where

---------------

 the second term is (a - (-b))? Wait, perhaps better to see:

Let me think of it as ( (-65) + (-64i) )*(

---------------

 (-65) + 64i )

Which is of the form (c + d)(c - d) where c = -65 and d =64i.

---------------

 Wait, no, actually:

Wait, (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b². So

---------------

 here, if we have ( (-65) + (-64i) )*( (-65) +64i ), then

---------------

 it's ( (-65) + (-64i) )*( (-65) - (-64i) )?

---------------

 Wait, no, not exactly. Let me re-express:

Wait, let me set x = -65 and y =64i. Then the first term is x - y and the second term is x + y. Wait, no:

Wait, first

---------------

 term: (-65 -64i) = x - y where x = -65 and y =64i?

---------------

 Wait, no, x - y would be (-65) - (64i). The second term is (-65 +64i) = x + y?

---------------

 Wait, x = -65, y =64i. Then x + y = (-65) +64i, and

---------------

 x - y = (-65) -64i. So yes, the product is (x - y)(x + y) = x² - y².

Therefore, indeed

---------------

, (-65)^2 - (64i)^2.

Compute that:

(-65)^2 = 4225

(64i)^2 = 64² * i² = 4096*(-1) = -4096

Therefore, the product is 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Exactly

---------------

 as before. So that's correct.

Therefore, P = 8321. Wait, so the product is 8321. Then

---------------

 the problem says to find the remainder when this is divided by 1000. So 8321 divided by 1000. The remainder is the last three digits. 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So 8321 mod 1000 is 321. Therefore, the answer is 321?



---------------

Wait, but hold on a second. Let me confirm again. Wait, the product P is equal to 8321? Let

---------------

 me recap all steps to be sure.

First, each term in the product over 13th roots of unity of (z² -2z +2). Then,

---------------

 factoring each quadratic as (z - (1+i))(z - (1 -i)), so the product becomes [Product_z (z - (1+i))] times [Product_z (z - (1 -i))]. Then each product over z

---------------

^{13}=1 of (z - a) is equal to - (a^13 -1). Therefore:

Product_z (z - (1+i)) = - [ (1 +i)^13 -1 ]

Product_z (z - (1 -i)) = - [ (1 -i)^13 -1 ]

Thus

---------------

, multiplying them gives [ - ( (1 +i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 -i)^13 -1 ) ] = [ (1 +i)^13 -1 ] * [ (1 -i)^13 -1 ]

Then,

---------------

 computing (1 +i)^13 and (1 -i)^13:

We found (1 +i)^13 = -64 -64i and (1 -i)^13 = -64 +64i. Then

---------------

 subtract 1 from each:

(1 +i)^13 -1 = -65 -64i

(1 -i)^13 -1 = -65 +64i

Multiplying these gives ( -65 -64i )( -65 +64i ) = 8321. So

---------------

 yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the product P is indeed 8321. Then, 8321 mod 1000 is 321. Therefore

---------------

, the remainder is 321.

But wait a second, let me think again. The problem states "the remainder when [...] is divided by 1000". So

---------------

 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000=8000, so 8321-8000=321. So yes, 321 is correct.

But

---------------

 hold on, I feel like maybe I missed a negative sign somewhere? Let me check the step where I computed the product over (z - a). The

---------------

 formula was Product_{z^{13}=1} (z - a) = - (a^{13} -1 ). Therefore

---------------

, if I have Product (z - a) = - (a^13 -1 ). Therefore, substituting a =1 +i and

---------------

 a=1 -i, so each product term is - ( (1 +i)^13 -1 ) and - ( (1 -i)^13 -1 ), so when multiplied together, gives

---------------

 [ - ( (1 +i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 -i)^13 -1 ) ] = [ ( (1 +i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1 -i)^13 -1 ) ]

Wait

---------------

, so that is correct. So no negative sign left. So that term is positive 8321. Therefore, the

---------------

 answer is 8321 mod 1000 = 321.

Hmm, but let me check

---------------

 with an alternative approach to confirm. Let me see if there's another way to compute the product. 

Alternatively, perhaps notice

---------------

 that z^13 =1, so for each term in the product, we can write z² -2z +2. Let me see if I

---------------

 can write this in terms of z^13. Maybe manipulate the expression:

Note that z^13 =1, so z^{-1} = z^{12}, etc. Not

---------------

 sure.

Alternatively, consider that the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z² -2z +2). Let me consider

---------------

 that the product is equal to the product over all z (z² - 2z + 2). Let me think of this as evaluating a

---------------

 certain polynomial at specific points. 

Suppose we consider the polynomial f(x) = Product_{z^{13}=1} (x - z). Then f(x) = x^13 -1. But how

---------------

 does that help?

Alternatively, perhaps think of the product as the resultant of some polynomials? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 consider logarithms? Probably not.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that the product over all roots z of (z² - 2 z + 2) is equal to the product over all roots of (z - α)(z - β), where α and β are roots of the quadratic equation x² -2x +2 =0. The

---------------

 roots are 1 ±i as before. So the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z - α)(z - β) is equal

---------------

 to [Product_z (z - α)] × [Product_z (z - β)] which is exactly what I did before. So that's

---------------

 consistent.

Therefore, that approach is correct, and the result is 8321. So mod 1000 is 321. Hmm

---------------

, so unless I made a mistake in calculating (1 +i)^13?

Let me recompute (1 +i)^13:



---------------

We know that (1 + i)^2 = 2i. So (1 +i)^2 = 2i. Then (1 +i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4. (1 +i)^8 = (-4)^2 =16. Then (1 +i)^12 = (1 +i)^8 * (1 +i)^4 = 16*(-4) = -64. Then (1 +i)^13 = (1 +i)^12 * (1 +i) = (-64)*(1 +i) = -64 -64i. Yes

---------------

, that matches. Similarly, (1 -i)^2 = (1 - 2i + i²) = 1 -2i -1 = -2i. Then (1 -i)^4 = (-2i)^2 = -4. (1 -i)^8 = (-4)^2 =16. (1 -i)^12 = (1 -i)^8*(1 -i)^4 =16*(-4) = -64. Then (1 -i)^13 = (1 -i)^12*(1 -i) = -64*(1 -i) = -64 +64i. That

---------------

 also checks out.

Therefore, all steps are correct, so 8321 mod 1000 is indeed 321. Therefore

---------------

, the answer should be 321.

Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check if the problem says

---------------

 "the product from k=0 to 12", which includes k=0, so when k=0, ω^0 =1, so the term is 2 -2*1 +1²= 2-2+1=1. So

---------------

 the first term is 1. Then the rest of the terms (from k=1 to 12) would be multiplied

---------------

. But in my calculation above, I considered all 13th roots of unity, so that's correct. However, let

---------------

 me see if the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z² -2z +2) is indeed 8321. Let

---------------

 me test with a simpler case. Let me try with a smaller n, say n=1, but 13 is prime. Maybe

---------------

 n=3? Let's see if the method works for n=3.

Suppose n=3, and compute product_{k=0}^2 (2 -2ω^k + ω^{2k}) where ω is a primitive 3rd root of unity.

First, let

---------------

's compute each term:

For k=0: 2 -2*1 +1² =1 as before.

For k=1: 2 -2ω + ω². Since ω^3=1, ω² = ω^{-1}

Similarly, for k=2: 2 -2ω² + ω^4 = 2 -2ω² + ω (since ω^4=ω)

So

---------------

 the product is (1)*(2 -2ω + ω²)*(2 -2ω² + ω)

Let me compute this.



---------------

Alternatively, using the same method as above: the product over all z^3=1 of (z² -2z +2). The

---------------

 roots are 1, ω, ω².

Compute Product_{z^3=1} (z² -2z +2) = (1 -2 +2)*(ω² -2ω +2)*(ω^4 -2ω² +2). Wait, but that

---------------

's similar to above.

Alternatively, using the formula: Product_{z^3=1} (z - a) = - (a^3 -1). So

---------------

 the product over (z^2 -2z +2) would be the same as before? Wait, no, same

---------------

 approach:

Factor z² -2z +2 into (z - (1+i))(z - (1 -i)), so the product over z^3=1 is [Product (z - (1+i))][Product (z - (1 -i))] = [ - ( (1 +i)^3 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 -i)^3 -1 ) ]

Compute (1 +i)^3: (1+i)^3 = 1 + 3i + 3i² + i^3 = 1 +3i -3 -i = (-2 +2i). Similarly

---------------

 (1 -i)^3 = 1 -3i +3i² -i^3 =1 -3i -3 +i = (-2 -2i).

Then

---------------

 (1 +i)^3 -1 = (-2 +2i) -1 = -3 +2i. Similarly (1 -i)^3 -1 = -3 -2i. Then

---------------

 the product becomes [ -(-3 +2i) ] * [ -(-3 -2i) ] = [3 -2i] * [3 +2i] = 9 +4 =13. 



---------------

Therefore, the product over all z^3=1 of (z² -2z +2) is 13. Let me compute directly

---------------

:

Compute each term:

At z=1: (1 -2 +2)=1.

At z=ω: (ω² -2ω +2). Let me compute for

---------------

 ω = e^(2πi/3) = -1/2 +i√3/2. Then ω² = e^(4πi/3) = -1/2 -i√3/2.

So �

---------------

�² -2ω +2 = [ -1/2 -i√3/2 ] -2[ -1/2 +i√3/2 ] +2 



---------------

= -1/2 -i√3/2 +1 -i√3 +2 

= ( -1/2 +1 +2 ) + ( -i√3/2 -i√3 )

= ( 5/2 ) + ( - (3i√3)/2 )

Wait, that's complex

---------------

. Hmm, but when multiplied by the term at z=ω², which would be similar but conjugated, perhaps the

---------------

 product becomes real?

Wait, let me compute the product (ω² -2ω +2)(ω -2ω² +2). Let me compute

---------------

 each term:

First term: (ω² -2ω +2)(ω -2ω² +2)

Let me expand

---------------

 this:

Multiply term by term:

First ω² * ω = ω^3 =1

ω²*(-2ω²) = -2ω^4 = -2ω (since ω^3=1, so ω^4=ω)

ω²*2 = 2ω²

-2ω * ω = -2ω²

-2ω*(-2ω²) = +4ω^3 =4*1=4

-2ω*2 = -4ω

+2*ω = 2ω

+2*(-2ω²) = -4ω²

+2*2 =4

Now,

---------------

 let's collect all terms:

1 (from first term)

-2ω (from second term)

+2ω² (from third term)

-2ω² (from fourth term)

+4 (from fifth term)

-4ω (from sixth term)

+2ω (from seventh term)

-4ω² (from eighth term)

+4 (from ninth term)

Now combine like terms:

Constants: 1 +4 +4 =9

Terms with ω: -2ω -4ω +2ω = (-2 -4 +2)ω = -4ω

Terms with ω²: 2ω² -2ω² -4ω² = (2 -2 -4)ω² = -4ω²

So total expression is 9 -4ω -4ω²

But since ω + ω² = -1 (because 1 + ω + ω² =0 for 

---------------

3rd roots), so -4(ω + ω²) = -4*(-1)=4. Therefore, the total is 9 +4 =13. So

---------------

 that matches the previous result. Therefore, the method works here. Thus, my approach for the original problem is valid. So

---------------

 8321 mod 1000 is indeed 321. 

Therefore, I think the answer is 321. 



---------------

Wait, but just to make sure, perhaps I miscalculated 8321 mod 1000. Let me do

---------------

 that again. 1000*8=8000, 8321-8000=321. So

---------------

 yes, that's correct. So I think the final answer is 321.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{321}


Given \(\omega \neq 1\) is a 13th root of unity, we need to find the remainder when the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000.

First, we recognize that the product is over all 13th roots of unity \(z\) (since \(\omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, \ldots, 12\) gives all 13th roots of unity). We rewrite each term \(2 - 2z + z^2\) as \(z^2 - 2z + 2\). Thus, the product becomes:

\[
\prod_{z^{13}=1} (z^2 - 2z + 2)
\]

We factor each quadratic term \(z^2 - 2z + 2\) as \((z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i))\). Therefore, the product can be split into two products:

\[
\left( \prod_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1 + i)) \right) \left( \prod_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1 - i)) \right)
\]

Using the polynomial \(z^{13} - 1\), which has roots at all 13th roots of unity, we know that for any complex number \(a\):

\[
\prod_{z^{13}=1} (z - a) = - (a^{13} - 1)
\]

Applying this to \(a = 1 + i\) and \(a = 1 - i\):

\[
\prod_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1 + i)) = - \left( (1 + i)^{13} - 1 \right)
\]
\[
\prod_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1 - i)) = - \left( (1 - i)^{13} - 1 \right)
\]

Calcul

---------------

ating \((1 + i)^{13}\) and \((1 - i)^{13}\):

- The modulus of \(1 + i\) is \(\sqrt{2}\), and its argument is \(\pi/4\). Raising to the 13th power:
  \[
  (1 + i)^{13} = (\sqrt{2})^{13} \left( \cos \frac{13\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{13\pi}{4} \right) = -64 - 64i
  \]
- Similarly, for \(1 - i\) with argument \(-\pi/4\):
  \[
  (1 - i)^{13} = (\sqrt{2})^{13} \left( \cos \left( -\frac{13\pi}{4} \right) + i \sin \left( -\frac{13\pi}{4} \right) \right) = -64 + 64i
  \]

Substituting these into the products:

\[
- \left( (1 + i)^{13} - 1 \right) = -(-64 - 64i - 1) = -(-65 - 64i) = 65 + 64i
\]
\[
- \left( (1 - i)^{13} - 1 \right) = -(-64 + 64i - 1) = -(-65 + 64i) = 65 - 64i
\]

Multiplying these results:

\[
(65 + 64i)(65 - 64i) = 65^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321
\]

Finally, finding the remainder of 8321 when divided by 1000:

\[
8321 \mod 1000 = 321
\]

Thus, the remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is \(\boxed{321}\).<|im_end|>
