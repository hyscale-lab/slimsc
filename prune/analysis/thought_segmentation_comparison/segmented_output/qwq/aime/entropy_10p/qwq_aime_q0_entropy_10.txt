Okay, let's see. I need to solve this system of logarithmic equations with three variables x, y, and z. The problem gives me three equations involving logarithms base 2 of ratios of these variables, and I need to find the absolute value of another logarithm expression involving x, y, z. Then, express that as a fraction m/n and find m + n. Alright, let's start by writing down the equations again to make sure I have them right.

The first equation is log base 2 of (x divided by (y*z)) equals 1/2. The second is log base 2 of (y divided by (x*z)) equals 1/3. The third is log base 2 of (z divided by (x*y)) equals 1/4. 



---------------

Hmm, since all the equations are logarithms with base 2, maybe converting them into exponential form could help. Let me recall that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So, applying that here:

First equation: 2^(1/2) = x/(y*z). 

Second equation: 2^(1/3) = y/(x*z).

Third equation: 2^(1/4) = z/(x*y).

So now I have three equations in terms of x, y, z. Maybe I can express each variable in terms of the others and then find a way to solve for them. Alternatively, since there

---------------

 are three equations and three variables, perhaps I can multiply or manipulate the equations to find a relationship between x, y, z.

Alternatively, since logarith

---------------

ms can be tricky, maybe taking all equations and converting them into equations without logs first would be better. Let me write them

---------------

 again:

1) x/(y z) = 2^(1/2)

2) y/(x z) = 2^(1/3)

3) z/(x y) = 2^(1/4)

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 multiplying all three equations together could simplify things? Let me try that.

Multiplying left sides together: (x/(y z)) * (y/(x z)) * (z/(x y)) 

Let me compute that step

---------------

 by step. 

First, multiply the first two fractions: (x/(y z)) * (y/(x z)) = (x * y) / (y z * x z) ) = (x y) / (x y z^2) ) = 1 / z^2. Wait, no

---------------

, let me check again. Wait, the denominator is y z times x z, so that's x y z^2, and numerator is x*y. So yeah

---------------

, (x y)/(x y z^2) ) = 1/z^2.

Then multiplying that by the third fraction (z/(x y)): 

(1/z^2) * (z/(x y)) = (1 * z) / (z^2 * x y) ) = 1/(z x y).

So the product of the left sides is 1/(x y z). 

The product of the right sides is 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/4). Since they have the same base, we can add exponents. Let me compute the exponents: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. To add these fractions, find a common denominator. 12 is the LCD. 

1/2 = 6/12, 1/3 = 4/12, 1/4 = 3/12. So total exponent is (6+4+3)/12 = 13/12. 

Therefore, the product of the right sides is 2^(13/12). 

So putting it all together:

1/(x y z) = 2^(13/12)

Therefore, x y z = 1/(2^(13/12)) = 2^(-13/12). 

Hmm, okay, so that's an equation involving x y z. Now

---------------

 maybe we can use this to find each variable. Let me see.

Looking back at the original equations, perhaps we can express each variable in terms of the product x y z.

---------------

 Let me see:

From equation 1: x = (y z) * 2^(1/2). Since x/(y z) = 2^(1/2), so x = 2^(1/2) * y z.

Similarly, equation 2: y = 2^(1/3) * x z.

Equation 3: z = 2^(1/4) * x y.

Hmm, so each

---------------

 variable is expressed in terms of the product of the other two times some power of 2. Maybe substitute these expressions into the equation for x y z?

Let me try that. Let me denote P = x y z = 2^(-13/12). 

From

---------------

 equation 1, x = 2^(1/2) y z. Therefore, substituting into P:

x y z = (2^(1/2) y z) * y z = 2^(1/2) * y^2 z^2. Wait, no, hold

---------------

 on. Wait, x y z is P, so substituting x:

P = x y z = (2^(1/2) y z) * y z = 2^(1/2) * y^2 z^2? Wait, that doesn

---------------

't seem right. Wait, actually, x is 2^(1/2)*y z, so substituting into x y z:

x y z = (2^(1/2) y z) * y z = 2^(1/2) * y z * y z = 2^(1/2) * (y z)^2. But

---------------

 that's equal to P. Wait, but P is already known as 2^(-13/12). Hmm, so

---------------

 maybe this approach is getting a bit tangled. Let me think of another way.

Alternatively, let me express each variable in terms of P. Since P = x y z, then:

From equation 1: x = 2^(1/2) y z. But since P = x y z, then substituting x gives

---------------

:

P = (2^(1/2) y z) * y z = 2^(1/2) y^2 z^2. Wait, that

---------------

 seems similar to before. Hmm. Maybe I can express y z in terms of P?

Since P = x y z, then y z = P / x. Therefore

---------------

, substituting into equation 1: x = 2^(1/2) * (P / x). So x

---------------

^2 = 2^(1/2) * P. Therefore, x = sqrt(2^(1/2) * P). Wait, but

---------------

 this might not be helpful yet.

Alternatively, maybe express each variable in terms of P and substitute into the equations. Let me see:

Let me denote

---------------

 equation 1: x = 2^(1/2) y z

equation 2: y = 2^(1/3) x z

equation 3: z = 2^(1/4) x y

Let

---------------

 me substitute equation 1 into equation 2. Let's see:

From equation 2: y = 2^(1/3) * x z. But x from equation 1 is 2^(1/2) y z, so substituting:

y = 2^(1/3) * (2^(1/2) y z) * z 

= 2^(1/3 + 1/2) * y z^2 

Hmm

---------------

, so y = 2^( (2/6 + 3/6 )) * y z^2 = 2^(5/6) * y z^2

Then

---------------

, subtract y from both sides? Wait, actually, let's rearrange:

Bring all terms to one side:

y - 2^(5/6) y z^2 = 0 

y (1 - 2^(5/6) z^2 ) = 0 

But since y is a positive real number, this

---------------

 implies 1 - 2^(5/6) z^2 = 0 => z^2 = 1 / 2^(5/6) => z = 1 / 2^(5/12). Wait, but maybe

---------------

 this is getting too convoluted. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, perhaps take the three original equations and write them as logarithmic expressions, then add or subtract the equations to get expressions

---------------

 for log x, log y, log z.

Since all logs are base 2, let me denote:

Letâ€™s let a = log2 x, b = log2 y, c = log2 z. Then, since

---------------

 log2(x/(y z)) = 1/2,

Using logarithm properties: log2 x - log2(y z) = 1/2.

---------------

 Which is log2 x - (log2 y + log2 z) = 1/2.

So in terms of a, b, c: a - (b + c) = 1/2. Similarly for the others.

Second

---------------

 equation: log2(y/(x z)) = 1/3. So log2 y - log2(x z) = 1/3 =>

---------------

 b - (a + c) = 1/3.

Third equation: log2(z/(x y)) =1/4. So log2 z - log2(x y) =1/4 => c - (a + b) =1/4.

So now we have a system of three linear equations in variables a, b, c.

Let me write them down:

1) a - b - c = 1/2

2) -a + b - c = 1/3

3) -a - b + c = 1/4

Hmm

---------------

, that's better! Now, linear equations. Let me write them again:

Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2

Equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3

Equation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4

Now, to

---------------

 solve this system, perhaps adding equations to eliminate variables.

First, let me label the equations for reference.

Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2



---------------

Equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3

Equation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4

Let me try adding equations 1 and 2 first

---------------

. 

Adding equation1 + equation2: 

(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) = (1/2 + 1/3)

Left side: (a - a) + (-b + b) + (-c - c) = 0 + 0 -2c = -2c

Right side: (3/6 + 2/6) = 5/6

So -2c = 5/6 => c = -5/12

Wait, but

---------------

 c is log2 z, so z is a positive real number, so log can be negative, but z is still positive, so that's okay.

Hmm

---------------

, so c = -5/12. Let me note that.

Now, let's add equations 1 and 3:

Equation1 + equation3:

(a - b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/2 + 1/4

Left side: a - a + (-b - b) + (-c + c) = -2b

Right side: 3/4

So -2b = 3/4 => b = -3/8

Similarly, adding equations 2 and 3:

Equation2 + equation3:

(-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/3 + 1/4

Left side: -a -a + b - b + (-c + c) = -2a

Right side: (4/12 + 3/12) = 7/12

Thus, -2a =7/12 => a = -7/24

Wait, so we

---------------

 have a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12.

Wait, let me check these

---------------

 calculations again, because the signs might be tricky.

First, equation1 + equation2:

Equation1: a - b - c = 1/2

Equation2: -a + b - c = 1/3

Adding:



---------------

(a - a) + (-b + b) + (-c - c) = 1/2 +1/3

So

---------------

 0 + 0 -2c = 5/6, so -2c =5/6 => c = -5/12. Correct.

Equation1 + equation3:

Equation1: a - b - c = 1/2

Equation3: -a - b + c =1/4

Adding:

(a -a) + (-b - b) + (-c + c) = 1/2 +1/4

So

---------------

 0 -2b +0 = 3/4 => -2b= 3/4 => b= -3/8. Correct.

Equation2 + equation3:

Equation2: -a + b -c =1/3

Equation3: -a - b +c =1/4

Adding:

(-a -a) + (b - b) + (-c +c) =1/3 +1/4

-2a +0 +0 =7/12 => -2a=7/12 => a= -7/24. Correct.

So,

---------------

 so far, a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12.

Let

---------------

 me check if these values satisfy all three equations.

First equation: a - b - c = (-7/24) - (-3/8) - (-5/12)

Convert to 24 denominators:

-7/24 + 9/24 + 10/24 = (-7 +9 +10)/24 =12/24 =1/2. Correct.

Second equation: -a + b - c = -(-7/24) + (-3/8) - (-5/12)

=7/24 - 9/24 +10/24 = (7 -9 +10)/24 =8/24 =1/3. Correct.

Third equation: -a - b + c = -(-7/24) - (-3/8) + (-5/12)

=7/24 +9/24 -10/24 = (7 +9 -10)/24 =6/24=1/4. Correct.

Perfect

---------------

. So the values are correct. 

Therefore, log2 x = a = -7/24, so x = 2^{-7/24}

Similarly, log2 y = b = -3/8, so y = 2^{-3/8}

log2 z = c = -5/12, so z = 2^{-5/12}

Now, the problem asks for | log2(x^4 y^3 z^2) |. Let's compute that.

First, log2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 log2 x + 3 log2 y + 2 log2 z

Substituting the known values:

4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12)

Let me compute each term:

4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6

3*(-3/8) = -9/8

2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6

Adding them up: (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)

First, combine the terms with denominator 6: (-7/6 -5/6) = -12/6 = -2

Then, remaining

---------------

 term: -9/8. So total is -2 -9/8 = - (16/8 +9/8) = -25/8

Therefore, log2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -25/8. The absolute value is 25/8.

So

---------------

 | log2(...) | =25/8. Since 25 and 8 are coprime, m=25, n=8, so m+n=33.

Wait, hold

---------------

 on. Let me double-check the arithmetic:

Compute 4*(-7/24): 4 * (-7) = -28; divided

---------------

 by 24: -28/24 reduces to -7/6. Correct.

3*(-3/8): 3*(-3)= -9;

---------------

 over 8. Correct.

2*(-5/12): 2*(-5) = -10 over 12,

---------------

 reduces to -5/6. Correct.

Adding them:

First, let's get all terms over 24 to check

---------------

:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

Total: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8. Yes

---------------

, because 75 divided by 3 is 25, 24 divided by 3 is 8. So that

---------------

's correct. So the total is indeed -25/8, absolute value 25/8. 

Therefore, m is 25, n is 8, which are coprime. So m + n is 33. 

Wait

---------------

, but let me confirm once again that I didn't make a mistake in the exponents. Let me retrace:

log2(x^4 y^3 z^2) =4a +3b +2c where

---------------

 a=log2 x, etc. 

Yes, so 4*(-7/24) is indeed -28/24 = -7/6.

---------------

 3*(-3/8)= -9/8, 2*(-5/12)= -10/12 = -5/6. 



---------------

Adding:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6. 

Let me add fractions step by step. Let's first

---------------

 combine -7/6 and -5/6: that's -12/6 = -2. Then, -2 -9/8. 

-2 is -16/8, so -16/8 -9/8 = -25/8. Yep

---------------

. Absolute value is 25/8. 

Therefore, the answer is 25 + 8 =33.

Final Answer**
\boxed{33}


Given the system of equations involving logarithms:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

We convert these logarithmic equations into their exponential forms:

1. \( \frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} \)
2. \( \frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3} \)
3. \( \frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4} \)

Multiplying all three equations together, we get:

\[
\left( \frac{x}{yz} \right) \left( \frac{y}{xz} \right) \left( \frac{z}{xy} \right) = 2^{1/2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4}
\]

Simplifying the left-hand side:

\[
\frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{yz \cdot xz \cdot xy} = \frac{1}{xyz}
\]

The right-hand side simplifies using the properties of exponents:

\[
2^{1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4} = 2^{(6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12)} = 2^{13/12}
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = 2^{13/12} \implies xyz = 2^{-13/12}
\]

Next, we introduce variables \(a = \log_2 x\), \(b = \log_2 y\), and \(c = \log_2 z\). Converting the original equations into linear form:

1. \( a - b - c = \frac{1}{2} \)
2. \( -a + b - c = \frac{1}{3} \)
3. \( -a - b + c = \frac{1}{4} \)

Solving this system of equations:

Adding equations 1 and 2:

\[
(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} \implies -2c = \frac{5}{6} \implies c = -\frac{5}{12}
\]

Adding equations 1 and 3:

\[
(a - b - c) + (-a - b + c) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} \implies -2b = \frac{3}{4} \implies b = -\frac{3}{8}
\]

Adding equations 2 and 3:

\[
(-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} \implies -2a = \frac{7}{12} \implies a = -\frac{7}{24}
\]

Thus, we have \(a = -\frac{7}{24}\), \(b = -\frac{3}{8}\), and \(c = -\frac{5}{12}\).

We need to find \(\left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right|\):

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4a + 3b + 2c
\]

Substituting the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):

\[
4 \left( -\frac{7}{24} \right) + 3 \left( -\frac{3}{8} \right) + 2 \left( -\frac{5}{12} \right)
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
4 \left( -\frac{7}{24} \right) = -\frac{28}{24} = -\frac{7}{6}
\]
\[
3 \left( -\frac{3}{8} \right) = -\frac{9}{8}
\]
\[
2 \left( -\frac{5}{12} \right) = -\frac{10}{12} = -\frac{5}{6}
\]

Summing these terms:

\[
-\frac{7}{6} - \frac{9}{8} - \frac{5}{6} = -\frac{28}{24} - \frac{27}{24} - \frac{20}{24} = -\frac{75}{24} = -\frac{25}{8}
\]

Taking the absolute value:

\[
\left| -\frac{25}{8} \right| = \frac{25}{8}
\]

Thus, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), leading to \(m + n = 33\).

\[
\boxed{33}
