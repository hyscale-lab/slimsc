Okay, let's see. So the problem is about Alice and Bob playing a game with n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. We need to find how many numbers n ≤ 2024 are such that Bob has a winning strategy, no matter what Alice does. Hmm.

First, I need to figure out for each n, who has the winning strategy. Since Alice goes first, if

---------------

 the starting position is a winning position, then Alice can force a win; otherwise, Bob can. So we need to find all n where the starting position is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win no matter what.

To approach this, maybe I can use dynamic programming or recurrence

---------------

 relations. Let me think of the possible moves and the resulting positions.

Let's denote a position n as winning (W) if the current player can force a win, and losing (L) if the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

The base cases would be:

- If n = 0, the game is over, so the previous player has won. So n

---------------

=0 is a losing position for the current player (since they can't move).
- For n=1: the current player takes 1 token and wins. So W.
- n=2: Take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. Alternatively, can't take 4, so only taking 1. So if you take 1, opponent takes 1 and wins. Wait, so maybe

---------------

 n=2 is a losing position? Wait no, hold on.

Wait, let me think again. For n=2:

Current player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent. Then opponent takes 1 and wins. Alternatively, the

---------------

 current player can't take 4 tokens because there are only 2. So their only move is to take 1, which leads to the opponent winning. Therefore, n=2 is a losing position for the current player. Wait, but that can

---------------

't be right. Because if the current player is at n=2, they have to leave the opponent with 1, which the opponent can take and win. So yes

---------------

, n=2 is a losing position. So the current player can't win if they are at n=2.

Wait, but

---------------

 n=1 is a winning position because you can take the last token. So let me formalize this.

Let me define

---------------

:

- A position n is a winning position (W) if there exists at least one move to a losing position (L) for the opponent.
- A position n is a losing position (L) if all moves lead to winning positions (W) for the opponent.

So starting with the base cases:

n=0: If

---------------

 there are 0 tokens, the game is over. Since the current player can't move, they lose. So n=0 is L.

n=1: The

---------------

 current player can take 1 token and win. So n=1 is W.

n=2: The current player can only take 1, leading to n=1 for the opponent. Since n=1 is a W position for the opponent, that

---------------

 means the opponent can win. Therefore, n=2 is L? Wait, because all moves from n=2 lead to the opponent being able to win. Since the

---------------

 only move is to n=1 (a W position), so yes, n=2 is L.

n=3: The current player can take 1, leading to n=2 (which is L for the opponent). Therefore, since there's a move to L, n=3 is W.

Wait, taking

---------------

 1 from n=3 leaves n=2 (L), so current player can force opponent into L. Therefore, n=3 is W.

n=4: The current player can take 4 tokens and win, so definitely a W position.

n=5: Let's see. Possible moves:

- Take 1, leaving n=4 (W for opponent)
- Take 4, leaving n=1 (W for opponent)

So

---------------

 all moves from n=5 lead to W positions for the opponent. Therefore, n=5 is L.

Wait, that

---------------

's interesting. n=5 is L.

n=6: Let's see.

Possible moves:

- Take 1, leaving n=5 (L for opponent). Since opponent

---------------

 is in L, that's good. Therefore, n=6 is W.

Alternatively, taking 4 would leave n=2 (L for

---------------

 opponent as well). Either way, there are moves to L, so n=6 is W.

Wait, but actually, if

---------------

 you can take either 1 or 4, so moving to n=5 (L) or n=2 (L). Either

---------------

 way, you can force opponent to L. So yes, W.

n=7:

Take 1 to 6 (W) or take 4 to 3 (W). Hmm

---------------

, both moves lead to W for the opponent. So n=7 would be L? Wait, let's check.

Wait n=6 is W, so if you take 1 from 7 to 6, opponent can win from there. Similarly, taking 4 from 7 leaves 3, which is W. Since all moves from 7 lead to W for opponent, then n=7 is L.

Wait, so n=7 is L.

n=8:

Take 1 to 7 (L) or take 4 to 4 (W). Since there

---------------

 exists a move to L (taking 1 to 7), then n=8 is W.

n=9:

Take 1 to 8 (W) or take 4 to 5 (L). Taking

---------------

 4 to 5 (L) is possible, so n=9 is W.

n=10:

Take 1 to 9 (W) or take 4 to 6 (W). Both moves lead to W.

---------------

 So n=10 is L?

Wait, so n=10 is L.

Hmm, so the losing positions so far are n=0,2,5,7,10...



---------------

Looking for a pattern here.

Looking at the sequence of L positions: 0, 2,5,7,10,...



---------------

Let me list more terms to see the pattern.

n=0: L

n=1: W

n=2: L

n=3: W

n=4: W

n=5: L

n=6: W

n=7: L

n=8: W

n=9: W

n=10:L

n=11: Let's compute.

n=11:

Take 1 to 10 (L) or take 4 to 7 (L). Either

---------------

 way, you can move to L positions. So n=11 is W.

Wait, so n=11 is W.



---------------

n=12:

Take 1 to 11 (W) or take 4 to 8 (W). Both lead to W, so n=12 is L.

Hmm, so L

---------------

 positions at 0,2,5,7,10,12,...

Wait, the difference between the L positions:

From 0 to 2: +2

2 to 5: +3

5 to7:+2

7 to10:+3

10 to12:+2

12 to...

---------------

 let's see n=13:

n=13:

Take 1 to 12 (L) or take 4 to 9 (W). Since moving

---------------

 to 12 (L) is possible, so n=13 is W.

n=14:

Take 1 to 13 (W) or take 4 to 10 (L). So

---------------

 moving to 10 (L) is possible, so n=14 is W.

n=15:

Take 1 to14 (W) or take 4 to11 (W). Both moves lead to W, so n=15 is L.

Wait

---------------

, so n=15 is L.

So L positions are 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,...

Hmm

---------------

, so the pattern seems like every 2 and 3 alternately? Let me see.

Looking at the differences between L positions:

0

---------------

 to 2: +2

2 to 5: +3

5 to7:+2

7 to10:+3

10 to12:+2

12 to15:+3

15 to17:+2?



---------------

Wait let's check n=16,17.

n=16:

Take 1 to15 (L) or take4 to12 (L). So

---------------

 moving to either L. Therefore, n=16 is W.

Wait, so n=16 is W. Then

---------------

 n=17:

Take1 to16 (W), take4 to13 (W). Both moves to W, so n=17 is L?

Wait, n

---------------

=17 would be L?

Wait, let me compute step by step:

n=15 is L.

n=16:

Taking

---------------

 1 from 16 gives 15 (L). Therefore, n=16 is W.

n=17:

Take

---------------

 1 to16 (W) or take4 to13 (W). Both moves lead to W, so n=17 is L.

Yes

---------------

, so n=17 is L. Then the difference from 15 to17 is +2. Hmm, so the pattern is

---------------

 adding 2 and 3 alternately?

0, +2=2, +3=5, +2=7, +3=10, +2=12, +3=15, +2=17, +3=20,...

Wait

---------------

, let me see:

Continuing:

n=17 is L, then next L would be 17+3=20?

Check n=18,19,20.

n=18:

Take1 to17 (L) or take4 to14 (W). So moving

---------------

 to L, so n=18 is W.

n=19:

Take1 to18 (W) or take4 to15 (L). Moving to L,

---------------

 so n=19 is W.

n=20:

Take1 to19 (W) or take4 to16 (W). Both moves lead to W, so n=20 is L. Yes, so 

---------------

20 is L. So that's +3 from 17 to 20. So the pattern seems to be adding

---------------

 2, 3, 2, 3, etc.

So the losing positions are numbers like 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,... and so on. The

---------------

 pattern alternates between adding 2 and 3. So every two steps, the total increase is 5, so the

---------------

 cycle is every 5?

Alternatively, perhaps the losing positions are numbers congruent to 2 or 0 mod 5? Wait, let me check.

Wait 0 mod5 is 0,5

---------------

,10,15,20,...

But in our list, the losing positions include 2,7,12,17,22,...

---------------

 which are 2 mod5?

Wait 2 mod5 is 2,7,12,17,22,...

---------------

 which are every 5 starting at 2. Similarly, 0 mod5 is 0,5,10,15,20,...

---------------

 So combining both sequences, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5?

Wait let's check:

n

---------------

=0: 0 mod5 → L

n=2: 2 mod5 → L

n=5: 0 mod5 → L

n=7: 7 mod5 is 2 → L

n=10: 0 mod5 → L

n=12: 12 mod5 is 2 → L

n=15: 0 mod5 → L

n=17: 17 mod5 is 2 → L

n=20: 0 mod5 → L

So yes! So

---------------

 the losing positions are exactly the numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.

Wait that seems to hold. Let me confirm with n=22:



---------------

22 mod5 is 2, so L. Let's see n=22:

Take1 to21 (which would be 21 mod5=1, which is not L,

---------------

 so W). Take4 to18 (18 mod5=3, which is W). So all moves from 22 (

---------------

L) lead to W positions. So yes, that's L. Similarly n=23:

23 mod5 is 3, so not

---------------

 L. 23 would be W because you can take 1 to 22 (L). So that works.

Therefore

---------------

, the losing positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Wait, so if that's the case, then for

---------------

 any n ≡0 or 2 mod5, it's a losing position. Therefore, if the starting n is a losing position, then the first player (Alice) will lose if Bob plays optimally. Therefore, the numbers n where Bob can force a win are exactly the losing positions, i.e., n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Wait but wait

---------------

 n=0 is a losing position, but n starts at 1. So for n ≥1, the losing positions are n ≡2 or 0 mod5, but n=0 isn't considered here.

---------------

 Wait, n=5 is 0 mod5 and is a losing position. So n=5 is included. So the

---------------

 losing positions for n ≥1 are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5. Therefore, the numbers where Bob can force a win are exactly these n

---------------

. So we need to count numbers ≤2024 where n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Wait but let me confirm

---------------

 with n=1: 1 mod5=1, so not losing, so Alice can win. Correct. n=2: 

---------------

2 mod5, so losing, so Bob can win. n=3: 3 mod5, so Alice can win. n=4: 4 mod5, Alice can take all and win. n=5: 0 mod5, Bob can win. So yes, that seems

---------------

 correct.

Therefore, the problem reduces to counting numbers ≤2024 congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.

So how

---------------

 many numbers ≤2024 are ≡0 or 2 mod5?

First, total numbers congruent to 0 mod5 up to 2024:

The numbers are 5,10,..., up to the largest ≤2024.

The largest multiple of 5 ≤2024 is 2020 (since 2024 divided by 5 is 404.8, so 404*5=2020).

Number of terms: 2020 /5 = 404. So 404 numbers.

Similarly, numbers ≡2 mod5 up to 2024:

These

---------------

 are 2,7,12,..., up to the largest ≤2024.

Let me see the last term: Let's

---------------

 compute 2024 divided by 5: 5×404=2020, so 2020 +2 =2022,

---------------

 which is 2 mod5 (2022 mod5= 2020 mod5 +2 mod5=0+2=2). So the last term is 2022.

The sequence starts at 2, each

---------------

 term +5. The nth term is 2 +5(n-1). So the last term is 2022=2+5(n-1). So

---------------

 2022-2=2020=5(n-1) → n-1=404 → n=405. Wait 

---------------

5×404=2020, so 2020+2=2022 is

---------------

 405th term? Let me check:

First term (n=1): 2 =2 +5×0

Second term (n=2):7=2+5×1

...

nth

---------------

 term: 2 +5(n-1)

Set 2 +5(n-1)=2022 → 5(n-1)=2020 → n-1=404 → n=405. So yes, 405 terms.

Therefore, numbers ≡2 mod5 contribute 405 numbers.

Numbers

---------------

 ≡0 mod5: 404 numbers (from 5 to 2020).

Total losing positions up

---------------

 to 2024: 404 +405=809.

Wait, but hold on,

---------------

 is 0 considered? Since n must be a positive integer, so n starts at 1. The losing positions start at n=2,5,7,10,... So 0 is excluded, so our

---------------

 counts above for 0 mod5 start at 5 (n=5), so that's okay. The 0 mod5 count (404 numbers) is

---------------

 correct because 5 to 2020 is 404 terms. The 2 mod5 count starts at 2, so up

---------------

 to 2022, which is 405 terms, so total 404+405=809.

But wait, let me check if

---------------

 2024 is included. The problem says "positive integers n less than or equal to 2024". So n=2024 is included. Let

---------------

 me check if 2024 is a losing position or not.

2024 mod5: 2024 divided by 5 is 404.8, so 5×404=2020, 2024-2020=4, so 2024 mod5=4. So it is not 0 or 2 mod5, so it is a winning position. So the

---------------

 counts for 0 and 2 mod5 up to 2024 are indeed 404 and 405,

---------------

 so total 809.

Therefore, the answer is 809.

Wait, but let me confirm with a

---------------

 smaller number to see if my counts are right.

Take n up to 10:

Numbers where Bob can win (losing positions): 2,5,7,10. That's 4 numbers.

Using

---------------

 formula: For n=10,

Numbers ≡0 mod5: 5,10 → 2 numbers.

Numbers ≡2 mod5:2,7 → 2 numbers.

Total 4, which matches. So that

---------------

 works.

Another check with n=12:

Losing positions up to 12: 2,5,7,10,12. So 5 numbers.

Using

---------------

 formula:

Numbers ≡0 mod5 up to 12: 5,10 → 2 numbers.

Numbers ≡2 mod5:2,7,12 (since 12 mod5 is 2). Wait 12 mod5 is 12-10=2. So 2,7,12 →

---------------

3 numbers. Total 2+3=5, which matches. So the formula works here.

Wait, so for numbers

---------------

 up to 12, 0 mod5: 5,10 (2 terms), and 2 mod5:2,7,12 (3 terms). So total

---------------

 5, correct.

Similarly, for n=15:

Losing positions up to 15: 0,2,5,7,10,12,15. But since

---------------

 n starts at 1, excluding 0, so 2,5,7,10,12,15: 6 numbers.

Using

---------------

 formula:

0 mod5: 5,10,15 → 3 numbers.

2 mod5:2,7,12 →3 numbers. Total 6. Correct.

Wait

---------------

 but 15 mod5 is 0, so included in the 0 mod5. So yes, that works.

Therefore

---------------

, seems the formula is correct.

Thus, for n up to 2024:

Number of n ≡0 mod5: floor(2024/5). Since 2024 divided by 5 is 404.8, so floor is 404, but since

---------------

 5×404=2020 ≤2024, that's correct. So 404 numbers.

Number of n≡2 mod5: first

---------------

 term 2, last term 2022.

Number of terms: ((2022 -2)/5)+1 = (2020/5)+1=404 +1=405. So 405 terms.

Total is 404+405=809.

Therefore, the answer is 809. Let

---------------

 me check once more.

Wait, 2024//5 is 404.8, so for multiples

---------------

 of 5, the count is 2020//5=404. So that's correct.

For numbers congruent to 2 mod5, starting at 2, each term is

---------------

 5k+2. The last term less than or equal to 2024 is 2022,

---------------

 which is 5*404 + 2=2022. So the number of terms is 404 +1=405.

---------------

 Because when k=0, you get 2, and k goes up to 404. So 405 terms. So

---------------

 yes, 404+405=809.

Therefore, the final answer is 809.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{809}


To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to identify the losing positions in the game. A position \( n \) is a losing position if the current player cannot force a win regardless of the opponent's moves. 

Through analysis, we found that the losing positions are those congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5. This pattern was derived by examining the game's possible moves and their

---------------

 outcomes, leading to the conclusion that positions \( n \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod} \, 5) \) or \( n \equiv 2 \, (\text{mod} \, 5) \) are losing positions.

To count these positions up to 2024:
1. **Numbers congruent to 0 mod 5**: These are 5, 10, 15, ..., 2020. The count is given by:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{2024}{5} \right\rfloor = 404
   \]
2. **Numbers congruent to 2 mod 5**: These are 2, 7, 12, ..., 2022. The count is calculated by:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{2022 - 2}{5} \right\rfloor + 1 = \frac{2020}{5} + 1 = 404 + 1 = 405
   \]

Summing these counts gives the total number of losing positions:
\[
404 + 405 = 809
\]

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy is \(\boxed{809}\).<|im_end|>
