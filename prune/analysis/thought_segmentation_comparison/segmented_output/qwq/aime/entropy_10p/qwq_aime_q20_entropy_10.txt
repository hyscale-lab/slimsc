Okay, so I need to find the smallest base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. Let me first

---------------

 make sure I understand what a b-eautiful number is. 

The problem says a positive integer n is b-eautiful if two conditions are met: first, when n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. The example given is 81 being 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6+3=9, which is the square root of 81. 

Alright, so let

---------------

 me formalize this. If n is a two-digit number in base b, then n can be written as n = a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, the first digit a must be at least 1 and less than b, and the second digit c must be between 0 and b-1, inclusive. The key

---------------

 equation here is that a + c = sqrt(n). 

So substituting n = a*b + c into the equation, we have a + c = sqrt(a*b + c). Let me write that down:

a + c = sqrt(a*b + c)

Hmm

---------------

, maybe I can square both sides to eliminate the square root. Let's try that.

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Expanding the left side gives:

a² + 2ac + c² = a*b + c

Let me rearrange this

---------------

 equation to collect like terms. Subtract a*b + c from both sides:

a² + 2ac + c² - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 I can rearrange terms:

a² + (2c - b)a + (c² - c) = 0

Hmm

---------------

, this is a quadratic equation in terms of a, with coefficients depending on c and b. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think

---------------

 in terms of variables a and c, and see if there's a way to parameterize solutions.

Alternatively, maybe I can express

---------------

 this equation as:

a² + 2ac + c² = a*b + c

Then, moving everything to the left:

a² + 2ac + c² - a*b - c = 0

Hmm

---------------

, maybe factor terms with a:

a² + a*(2c - b) + (c² - c) = 0

This

---------------

 is a quadratic equation in a. For a to be an integer, the discriminant must be a perfect square. Let's compute the discriminant D:

D = (2c - b)^2 - 4*1*(c² - c) 

Let me compute that:

D = 4c² - 4b c + b² - 4c² + 4c

Simplify terms:

The 4c² cancels with -4c², so we have:

D = -4b c + b² + 4c 

Hmm

---------------

, so D = b² -4b c +4c 

Hmm, so discriminant D must be a perfect square for a to be integer. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this. Let me think again.

Let me consider that n = a*b + c, and sqrt

---------------

(n) = a + c. So n = (a + c)^2. Therefore, we have:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

So

---------------

, rearranged:

a*b = (a + c)^2 - c

Therefore,

a*b = a² + 2a c + c² - c

Wait

---------------

, that's the same equation as before, so maybe this isn't helpful. Alternatively, since n = (a + c)^2, then

---------------

 n must be a perfect square. That's an important point. So all b-eautiful numbers must be perfect squares. 



---------------

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding perfect squares n such that when written in base b as two digits (i.e., between b and b² - 1), their digits sum to their square root. 

So

---------------

, given that n is a perfect square, let me denote sqrt(n) = s, so that n = s². Then the two

---------------

 digits in base b must satisfy a + c = s, and n = a*b + c. Since n = s², then

---------------

:

s² = a*b + c

But since a + c = s, so c = s - a. Substitute that into the equation:

s² = a*b + (s - a)

S

---------------

implify:

s² = a*b + s - a

Bring all terms to one side:

s² - s = a*(b - 1)

So,

a = (s² - s)/(b - 1)

Hmm, interesting

---------------

. Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1 (since it's the first digit in base b), and

---------------

 c must be between 0 and b-1. Also, since c = s - a, then c must also satisfy 0 ≤ c ≤ b -1, so s - a must be in that interval. 

So,

---------------

 from the equation above, a must equal (s² - s)/(b -1). Since a must be an integer, this tells

---------------

 us that (b -1) must divide (s² - s). 

Therefore, for each possible s, the base

---------------

 b can be such that (b -1) divides (s² - s). Let me see if this is helpful. 

Alternatively, since

---------------

 we need to find for a given b, how many such numbers n exist. Since n is a two-digit number in base b, n

---------------

 must be between b (since 10_b is b in decimal) and b² -1 (since the maximum two-digit number in base b is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b² -1). 



---------------

So n is in [b, b² -1], and n must be a perfect square. Let me denote s = sqrt(n). Then s must satisfy s²

---------------

 is in [b, b² -1], so s is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and floor(sqrt(b² -1)). Since sqrt(b² -1) is less

---------------

 than b, so floor(sqrt(b² -1)) is b -1. Therefore s ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b -1. 

Therefore

---------------

, for each s from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b -1, we can check if (s² - s) is divisible by (b -1). Then a would be (s² - s)/(b -1), and then c = s - a. 

Moreover

---------------

, the digits a and c must satisfy 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1. Since

---------------

 a is already (s² - s)/(b-1), so we need to check whether a is within 1 to b-1 and c = s - a is within 0 to b-1. 

So for

---------------

 each s in that range, if (s² - s) is divisible by (b-1), then compute a and check the constraints. Each such valid (a, c) pair corresponds to a unique n = s², so each valid s gives a unique n. 

Therefore, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers s between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b -1 such that (s² - s) is divisible by (b -1), and the

---------------

 digits a and c satisfy their constraints. 

So our goal is to find the smallest b ≥2 such that the number of such s is greater than 10. 

Hmm, so

---------------

 perhaps it's better to approach this problem by considering for a given b, how many s satisfy the conditions. Let's try

---------------

 to formalize this. 

Let me denote that for a given b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers s in

---------------

 [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that (s² - s) is divisible by (b -1), and when

---------------

 a = (s² - s)/(b-1), then c = s - a must be between 0 and b-1. 

Alternatively

---------------

, since c = s - a = s - (s² - s)/(b-1). Let me compute that:

c = s - (s² - s)/(b -1) 

Let me factor s from numerator:

c = s [1 - (s -1)/(b -1)] 

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, let

---------------

 me compute c:

c = s - [ (s(s -1)) / (b -1) ]

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 it's better to note that since a must be at least 1, so (s² - s)/(b -1) ≥1,

---------------

 so s(s-1) ≥ (b -1). Also, since a must be less than b, then (s² -s)/(b -1) < b. 

So

---------------

:

(s² - s) / (b -1) < b ⇒ s² - s < b(b -1)

Similarly

---------------

, since c = s - a must be ≥0, so s - (s² - s)/(b -1) ≥0 ⇒

---------------

 

s ≥ (s² - s)/(b -1)

Multiply both sides by (b-1) (assuming b >

---------------

1, which it is):

s(b -1) ≥ s² - s

Bring all terms to left:

s(b -1) - s² + s ≥0 ⇒ 

-s² + s(b -1 +1) ≥0 ⇒ 

-s² + s b ≥0 ⇒ 

s(-s + b) ≥0 ⇒ 

Since s is positive, this implies that -s + b ≥0 ⇒ s ≤ b. 

But since s is at most b-1, that's okay. So that

---------------

 condition is automatically satisfied. 

The other condition is c ≤ b-1. Let's see:

c = s - a = s - (s² -s)/(b -1) ≤ b -1

So:

s - [ (s² - s)/(b -1) ] ≤ b -1

Multiply both sides by (b-1):

s(b -1) - (s² - s) ≤ (b -1)^2

Left side:

s(b -1) - s² + s = s b - s - s² + s = s b - s²

Therefore:

s b - s² ≤ (b -1)^2

Rearranged:

-s² + s b - (b -1)^2 ≤0 ⇒ 

Multiply

---------------

 by -1 (inequality reverses):

s² - s b + (b -1)^2 ≥0 

Hmm, let

---------------

's see if this is always true. Let me compute the discriminant of the quadratic in s:

Discriminant D = b² -4*1*(b -1)^2 = b² -4(b² - 2b +1 ) = b² -4b² +8b -4 = -3b² +8b -4 

Hmm, this

---------------

 is getting complicated. Maybe instead of trying to handle the inequality algebraically, perhaps it's better to note that for c to be ≤ b-1, since

---------------

 c = s - a and a is (s² -s)/(b-1). 

Alternatively, perhaps instead of dealing

---------------

 with inequalities, since we can just compute for each s, the value of a and c and check if they are valid digits. 

But

---------------

 since we need to find the minimal b where there are more than ten such numbers, maybe we can find a formula for the number of s for

---------------

 each b. 

Alternatively, perhaps think of s as a variable and see for which b, the equation (s² - s) divisible

---------------

 by (b-1) gives multiple s. Let me think differently. 

Let me consider that (b -1) divides s(s -1). So for

---------------

 each s, the divisors of s(s -1) are the possible (b -1). Since s and s-1 are coprime (consecutive integers), their

---------------

 GCD is 1. Therefore, the divisors of s(s-1) are products of divisors of s and divisors of s-1. 

Thus, for

---------------

 each s, the possible values of (b -1) must be a divisor of s(s-1). Therefore, for a given b-1 = d, which

---------------

 is a divisor of s(s-1), then s must be such that d divides s(s-1). 

Alternatively, if

---------------

 we fix d = b -1, then the number of s such that d divides s(s -1) and s is between ceil(sqrt(d +1)) and (d). Because

---------------

 since s must be up to b-1 = d. Wait, since s is up to b-1, and b = d +1, so s up

---------------

 to d. 

Wait, let me rephrase. Let me set d = b -1. Then b = d +1. So

---------------

 the range of s is ceil( sqrt(b) ) to b -1, which is ceil( sqrt(d +1) ) to d. 

Therefore

---------------

, for each d (which is b -1), the number of s between ceil( sqrt(d+1) ) and d such that d divides s(s-1). 

Our

---------------

 goal is to find the minimal d +1 (since b = d +1) such that the number of such s is greater than 10. 

Therefore, the

---------------

 problem reduces to finding the smallest d ≥1 such that the number of integers s in [ceil( sqrt(d+1) ), d] where d divides s(s-1) is greater than 10. Then b = d +1.

---------------

 

Hmm, okay. So perhaps it's better to think in terms of d instead of b. Let me proceed with that.

---------------

 

First, note that s and s-1 are coprime, so d divides s(s-1) implies that d must divide the

---------------

 product of two coprime numbers, so d must be a product of factors of s and factors of s-1. Since they are coprime, the factors of d must partition between s and s-1. 

Therefore, for each s in the interval, either

---------------

:

- d divides s, or 

- d divides s-1, or 

- factors of d divide s and the

---------------

 complementary factors divide s-1. 

But this might complicate. Alternatively, since d divides s(s -1), each

---------------

 prime factor of d must divide either s or s -1. 

Alternatively, perhaps for each d, we can count the numbers s in the interval [ceil( sqrt(d +1)), d] such that s ≡0 mod d

---------------

 or s ≡1 mod d? Wait no, that would only be if d divides s or s-1, but d

---------------

 divides s(s-1) can be in other ways too. For example, if d has factors that divide s and others

---------------

 divide s-1. 

Hmm, perhaps it's better to note that s mod d can be any residue, but the

---------------

 product s(s -1) mod d must be 0. Therefore, s ≡0 mod d or s ≡1 mod d. Wait, actually

---------------

, if s ≡0 mod d, then s(s-1) ≡0 mod d. Similarly, if s ≡1 mod d, then s-1 ≡0 mod d. However

---------------

, if s is congruent to something else mod d, but d factors into parts that divide s and parts that divide s-1. But

---------------

 since s and s-1 are coprime, the factors of d must divide either s or s-1 but not both. 

Therefore, the

---------------

 solutions s mod d are exactly those where s ≡0 mod d or s ≡1 mod d. Wait, is

---------------

 that true? Let me think. Suppose d has a prime p dividing it. Then p divides s or p divides s-1, but since s and s-1 are coprime, each

---------------

 prime factor of d must divide exactly one of s or s-1. Therefore, for each prime factor of d, we

---------------

 can choose whether it divides s or s-1, but the combined congruence must hold. 

However, the total

---------------

 number of solutions s mod d where d divides s(s-1) is exactly the number of solutions to s ≡0 mod p_i

---------------

 or s≡1 mod p_i for each prime p_i dividing d. Wait, perhaps more systematically, using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. 

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps the number of solutions s mod d is 2^k, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of d. However

---------------

, this might not be precise. 

Alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions s mod d to s(s-1) ≡0 mod d is equal to the number of div

---------------

isors of d? Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think of an example. 

Take d = 6. Then s

---------------

(s -1) ≡0 mod 6. The solutions mod 6 would be s ≡0 or 1 mod 2 and mod 3. 



---------------

Wait, let's compute:

s(s-1) ≡0 mod 6. 

This requires that s ≡0 mod 2 or s ≡1 mod 2, and s ≡0 mod 3 or s ≡1 mod3. Wait, actually, no

---------------

. Let me think again. 

Wait, s(s-1) must be divisible by 2 and by 3. 

To

---------------

 be divisible by 2: either s even or s-1 even, which is always true, since one of two consecutive numbers is even. Similarly, for

---------------

 divisibility by 3: either s ≡0 mod3 or s≡1 mod3. So the condition is that

---------------

 s ≡0 or1 mod3. 

Thus, the solutions mod 6 are numbers congruent to 0,1,3,4 mod6. 



---------------

Indeed, check s=0 mod6: s=0 mod6 ⇒ divisible by 2 and 3. 

s=1 mod6: 1 mod6 ⇒ s-1=0 mod6.



---------------

s=3 mod6: divisible by 3, so s divisible by 3, but mod2: 3 is odd, so s-1 even,

---------------

 so 3 mod6 is okay.

s=4 mod6: 4 mod6 ⇒ s-1 =3 mod6, which is divisible by 3.

---------------

 

So total solutions mod6: 4 solutions. 

So 2^2=4, since 6 has two distinct prime factors. So perhaps

---------------

 in general, for square-free d with k distinct prime factors, the number of solutions mod d is 2^k. 

Therefore

---------------

, in general, the number of solutions mod d to s(s-1) ≡0 mod d is 2^{ω(d)}, where ω(d) is the number of distinct prime factors of d. 

But

---------------

 this is when d is square-free. If d is not square-free, say d has a prime power p^e, then perhaps

---------------

?

Wait, let me think. Suppose d has a square factor, say d = p^2. Then s(s-1) ≡0 mod p^2. This

---------------

 requires that either s ≡0 mod p^2 or s ≡1 mod p^2, because if s ≡0 mod p, then s must

---------------

 be 0 mod p^2 to have p^2 divide s, or s-1 must be 0 mod p^2. Otherwise

---------------

, if s ≡k mod p^2 where k is between 1 and p^2-1 not 0 or 1, then neither

---------------

 s nor s-1 is divisible by p^2, but since they are consecutive, they can't both be divisible by p. So

---------------

 actually, for prime powers, the number of solutions mod p^e is 2. 

Therefore, even for prime powers, the number of solutions mod p^e is 2. 



---------------

Therefore, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the number of solutions mod d is 2^{ω(d)}, where ω(d) is the number of distinct prime factors of d, even if d is not square-free? Wait, let

---------------

's see. 

Wait, if d is p^e, then solutions mod d are 2. If d is p^e * q^f, then solutions mod d would be 2*2=4, so

---------------

 indeed 2^{number of distinct primes}. So even if d has multiple exponents, as long as the prime factors are distinct, the number is 2^{ω(d)}. 

Therefore, the total number of solutions s mod d is 2^{ω(d)}. 

Therefore

---------------

, in the interval from ceil(sqrt(d+1)) to d, how many integers s are congruent to 0 or 1 mod each prime power in

---------------

 d's factorization? Wait, actually, the solutions mod d are those s where s ≡0 or1 mod each prime factor?

---------------

 Wait no, the solutions mod d are those s such that for each prime p dividing d, s ≡0 or1 mod p. 



---------------

Wait, actually, for each prime p dividing d, s must be ≡0 or1 mod p. Therefore, the

---------------

 solutions mod d are the numbers s congruent to a tuple (a_p) where a_p is 0 or1 mod p for each prime p dividing d. 



---------------

By Chinese Remainder Theorem, this gives 2^{ω(d)} solutions mod d. 

Therefore, the total number of solutions in the

---------------

 range [1, d] would be roughly 2^{ω(d)}, but exactly, it's floor(d / m) *

---------------

 2^{ω(d)} ? Not exactly, perhaps exactly 2^{ω(d)} solutions mod d, so in each block of d numbers, there are 2^{ω(d)} solutions. 

Therefore, in the interval from 1 to d, the number of solutions is exactly 2^{ω(d)}. 



---------------

However, in our problem, the interval is from ceil(sqrt(d+1)) to d. 

Therefore, the total number of solutions s in that interval would be equal

---------------

 to (number of solutions between 1 and d) minus (number of solutions between 1 and ceil(sqrt(d+1)) -1). 

Hmm

---------------

, so to compute the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)), d], it's equal to:

Number of solutions mod

---------------

 d in [1,d] minus the number of solutions in [1, ceil(sqrt(d+1)) -1]

But

---------------

 since the total number of solutions mod d in [1,d] is exactly 2^{ω(d)}, because each residue class mod d occurs

---------------

 exactly once in 1 to d. Therefore, the number of solutions in [1, d] is exactly 2^{ω(d)}. 

Therefore, the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)), d] is equal to 2^{ω(d)} minus the number of solutions less than ceil(sqrt(d+1)). 

Hmm

---------------

, but this might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps for large d, the number of solutions in the interval [sqrt(d), d] is roughly (d - sqrt(d)) / d * 2^{ω(d)} }

---------------

? Not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe we can approximate that the number of solutions is roughly proportional to 2^{ω(d)}. So

---------------

 to get more than ten solutions, we need 2^{ω(d)} to be greater than ten? But that would be

---------------

 2^4=16, so ω(d) >=4. But perhaps not exactly, because the solutions are

---------------

 spread out. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of d such that 2^{ω(d)} is large enough, but also

---------------

 that the interval [sqrt(d+1), d] is large enough. 

Alternatively, let me try small values of d and see how

---------------

 the count works. 

Wait, but maybe it's better to think of the number of s between ceil(sqrt(d+1)) and d where

---------------

 s ≡0 or1 mod p for each prime p dividing d. 

Alternatively, since the number of solutions is 2^{ω(d)}, but

---------------

 they are spread throughout the range. 

Alternatively, maybe the minimal d where 2^{ω(d)} exceeds 10?

---------------

 Since 2^4=16, so ω(d)>=4. The smallest d with ω(d)>=4 is 2*3*5*7=210. But that

---------------

's probably too big, and maybe the actual number of solutions in the interval is less. 

Alternatively, perhaps my approach is wrong. Let me think again. 

Wait

---------------

, maybe instead of trying to find an exact formula, I can compute for various values of b (or d = b-1) and count the number of s.

---------------

 

Given that we need the first b where there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers, perhaps trying b starting from 2 upwards and count

---------------

 until we reach the first b with over ten. 

But that might take a while, but maybe manageable. Let's see. 

Alternatively, let

---------------

's see if there's a smarter way. Let me think again of the equation:

We have s² = a*b + c, with a + c = s. 



---------------

We also have a = (s² - s)/(b -1). 

Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, so

---------------

 (s² - s) must be divisible by (b -1). 

Moreover, c = s - a must be between 0 and b-1. 

So

---------------

 for each b, the possible s are those where s(s -1) divisible by (b-1). 

So for

---------------

 each b, the number of s is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (b-1) divides s(s-1). 

Therefore

---------------

, perhaps the number of such s is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) in some way? 



---------------

Alternatively, for each s between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1, check if (b-1) divides s(s-1). 

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 think of s(s-1) ≡0 mod (b-1). 

So for a given b, the number

---------------

 of s in that interval is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] where s ≡0 or 1 mod p

---------------

 for each prime p dividing (b-1). 

Hmm, perhaps I need to look for b where (b-1) has many factors, so that there are many s in

---------------

 the interval that satisfy the congruence. 

Alternatively, since s ranges from about sqrt(b) to b-1, so

---------------

 the length of the interval is roughly b - sqrt(b). 

To have more than 10 solutions, maybe b needs to be large enough so that the

---------------

 interval is large and the modulus (b-1) has many divisors, allowing many s to satisfy s(s-1) divisible by (b-1). 

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 choosing (b-1) as a factorial or something with many factors. 

Alternatively, let me consider that (b-1) divides

---------------

 s(s-1). Let me note that s and s-1 are coprime, so (b-1) must divide s

---------------

 or divide s-1, or split into factors dividing each. 

Wait, but since they are coprime, the

---------------

 factors of (b-1) must divide either s or s-1, but not both. 

Therefore, the number

---------------

 of s in the interval is equal to the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that s ≡0 mod d or s≡1 mod d, where d divides (b-1). Wait, not

---------------

 exactly. 

Alternatively, since (b-1) divides s(s-1), then for each divisor d of (b-1), either

---------------

 s ≡0 mod d or s≡1 mod ( (b-1)/d ). Hmm, not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 for each divisor m of (b-1), the number of s ≡0 mod m or s≡1 mod ( (b-1)/m ). Not

---------------

 sure. 

Alternatively, let me think of (b-1) as some number, say, let me pick a specific

---------------

 value for b and compute the number of s. 

Let me try with b=10. Then d=9. 

So

---------------

, for b=10, d=9. 

We need s in [ceil(sqrt(10)), 9] =

---------------

 [4,9]. 

We need s(s-1) divisible by 9. 

So check s from 4 to9:

s=4: 4*3=12.

---------------

 12 mod9=3 → no.

s=5:5*4=20 mod9=2 → no.

s=6:6*5=30 mod9=3 → no.

s=7:7*6=42 mod9=6 → no.

s=8:8*7=56 mod9=2 → no.

s=9:9*8=72 mod9=0 → yes. 

Thus only s=9 is valid. 

So there

---------------

's only one 10-beautiful number. 

Hmm, so b=10 gives 1. 

Trying b=7

---------------

 (d=6). 

s from ceil(sqrt(7))=3 to 6.

Check s=3: 3*2=6 divisible by 6 → yes. 

s=4:4*3=12 divisible by6 → yes.

s=5:5*4=20 mod6=2 → no.

s=6:6*5=30 divisible by6 → yes. 

Thus s=3,4,6. So three numbers. 

So

---------------

 b=7 gives 3. 

b=6 (d=5):

s from ceil(sqrt(6))=3 to 5.

Check s=3:3*2=6 mod5=1 → no.

s=4:4*3=12 mod5=2 → no.

s=5:5*4=20 mod5=0 → yes.

Only s=5. So 1.

Hmm, okay

---------------

. 

Trying b=15 (d=14). 

s from ceil(sqrt(15))=4 to14. 

We

---------------

 need s(s-1) divisible by14. 

14 factors into 2 and7. 

Thus s must satisfy s ≡0 or1 mod2 and mod7. 

Wait

---------------

, s(s-1) divisible by2 and by7. 

For divisibility by2: since s and s-1 are consecutive, one is even, so that

---------------

's always true. 

For divisibility by7: s ≡0 mod7 or s≡1 mod7. 

Thus in

---------------

 the range s=4 to14, the valid s are those congruent to0 or1 mod7. 

Numbers

---------------

 between 4-14:

s=0 mod7: 7,14

s=1 mod7:1,8,15 (

---------------

but 15 is beyond 14). So 1 is below 4, so 8.

Thus s=7,8,14. 

Check each

---------------

:

s=7:7*6=42 divisible by14 → yes. 

s=8:8*7=56 divisible by14 → yes. 

s=14:14*13=182 divisible by14 → yes. 

Thus

---------------

 3 numbers. 

Hmm, still low. 

Trying b=16 (d=15). 

d=15,

---------------

 so s from 4 to15. 

We need s(s-1) divisible by15. 

15 factors into 3 and5. 

Thus s must be ≡0 or1 mod3 and mod5. 

So

---------------

 solving s ≡0 or1 mod3 and s≡0 or1 mod5. 

Total solutions mod15: 2*2=4 solutions

---------------

. 

Possible residues mod15:

Looking for s ≡0 or1 mod3 and 0 or1 mod5.

Let

---------------

 me list all possibilities:

Case1: s≡0 mod3 and s≡0 mod5 → s≡0 mod15.

Case2: s≡0 mod3 and s≡1 mod5 → solve

---------------

 s=3k, s=5m+1. 3k ≡1 mod5 ⇒ 3k≡1 ⇒ k≡2 mod5. So k=5n+2 ⇒ s=15n +6.

Case3: s≡1 mod3 and s≡0 mod5 → s=5m, s

---------------

≡1 mod3 ⇒5m≡1 mod3 ⇒ m≡2 mod3 ⇒ m=3k+2 ⇒ s=15k +10.

Case4: s≡1 mod3 and s≡1 mod5 → s≡1 mod15.

Thus residues

---------------

 mod15 are 0,6,10,1 mod15.

Therefore, in the range 4 to15, the s

---------------

 that satisfy are:

Numbers ≡0,1,6,10 mod15 in that interval. 

Numbers from4-15:

Check residues

---------------

:

Numbers:

s=6:6 mod15 → yes (6 mod15 is 6 which is in the cases above

---------------

 (case2:6 mod15))

s=10:10 mod15 → yes (case3)

s=15:15 mod15=0 → yes (case1)

s=1:1

---------------

 mod15 → but 1 is below 4.

s= 1 mod15 in the interval: s=16 is

---------------

 over, so only s=1, which is too low.

Wait, in 4 to15, the numbers that

---------------

 are 0 mod15:15

1 mod15:1, 16 (out of range). So only 15.

Similarly 6 mod15:6, 21 (out of

---------------

 range). So 6.

10 mod15:10, 25 (out). So 10.

Thus s=6,10,15. 

Wait

---------------

, but s=15 is included as it's up to 15. 

Wait, let's check each s from4-15:

s=4:4*3=12 mod

---------------

15=12 → not divisible by15.

s=5:5*4=20 mod15=5 → no.

s=6:6*5=30 mod15=0 → yes.

s=7:7*6=42 mod15=12 → no.

s=8:8*7=56 mod15=11 → no.

s=9:9*8=72 mod15=72-60=12 → no.

s=10:10*9=90 mod15=0 → yes.

s=11:11*10=110 mod15=110-90=20 mod15=5 → no.

s=12:12*11=132 mod15=132-135= -3 mod15 → 12 → no.

s=13:13*12=156 mod15=156-150=6 → no.

s=14:14*13=182 mod15=182-180=2 → no.

s=15:15*14=210 mod15=0 → yes.

Thus,

---------------

 s=6,10,15. So three numbers again. 

Hmm, still not enough. 

Trying b=21 (d=20). 

d

---------------

=20, so s from ceil(sqrt(21))=5 to20. 

We need s(s-1) divisible by20. 

20 factors into 2^2 and5. 

Thus

---------------

, s(s-1) must be divisible by4 and5. 

Divisible by4: since s and s-1 are consecutive, one is even. To have divisible by4, either:

- s even

---------------

 and divisible by4, or 

- s-1 even and divisible by4 (i.e., s ≡1 mod4). 

Additionally

---------------

, divisible by5: s ≡0 or1 mod5. 

Therefore, s must satisfy:

Either s ≡0 mod4 or s≡1 mod4,

AND



---------------

s ≡0 or1 mod5.

Thus, combining these conditions. 

Let me consider all combinations:

Possible cases mod2

---------------

0 (since 4 and5 are coprime):

First, mod4 and mod5:

We can use Chinese Remainder Theorem. 

Let

---------------

 me list the possible residues mod4 and mod5:

For mod4: s ≡0 or1 mod4.

For mod5: s ≡0 or1 mod5.

Thus, total

---------------

 2*2=4 combinations:

1. s≡0 mod4 and s≡0 mod5: solve s≡0 mod lcm(4,5)=20. So s≡0 mod20.

2. s≡0 mod4 and s≡1 mod5: find

---------------

 s ≡0 mod4 and 1 mod5. Let s=4k. Then 4k≡1 mod5 ⇒4k≡1 ⇒k≡4^{-1}*1 mod5. Since 4*4=16≡1 mod5 ⇒ inverse of4 is4. Thus k≡4 mod5 ⇒k=5m+4 ⇒ s=4*(5m+4)=20m +16. So s≡16 mod20.

3. s≡1 mod4 and s≡0 mod5: s≡1 mod4 and 0 mod5. Let s=5k. Then 5k≡1 mod4 ⇒5≡1 mod4 ⇒ so 1*k≡1 mod4 ⇒k≡1 mod4 ⇒k=4m+1 ⇒ s=5*(4m+1)=20m +5 ⇒ s≡5 mod20.

4. s≡1 mod4 and s≡1 mod5: s≡1 mod lcm(4,5)=20. So s≡1 mod20.

Thus the solutions mod20 are residues

---------------

 0,1,5,16 mod20. 

Thus in the interval 5 to20:

Numbers

---------------

 congruent to 0,1,5,16 mod20.

Check each:

Numbers:

0 mod20: 20.



---------------

1 mod20:1 (too low), 21 (too high).

5 mod20:5,25 (too high).

16 mod20:16.

Thus in

---------------

 the range 5 to20:

s=5,16,20.

Check these:

s=5:5*4=20 divisible by20 → yes.

s=16:16*15=240 divisible by20 → yes.

s=20:20*19=380 divisible by20 → yes.

Wait

---------------

, s=5: s=5 is in the range (5 to20). 

Wait, s=5:

---------------

 5 is the lower bound. 

So s=5,16,20. That's three numbers. Hmm, same as before. 

Hmm, not

---------------

 enough. 

Wait, maybe need a higher base. Let me try b=25 (d=24). 

d=24, so s from ceil(sqrt(25))=5 to24. 

Need s(s-1) divisible by24. 

24 factors into 3*8 (2

---------------

^3*3). 

Thus, s(s-1) divisible by8 and by3. 

Divisible by8: since

---------------

 s and s-1 are consecutive, one even, one odd. The even one must be divisible by8, or the product

---------------

 must have three factors of2. Since only one even term, so that even term must be divisible by8. 

Thus

---------------

, either s ≡0 mod8 or s≡1 mod8. 

Divisible by3: s≡0 or1 mod3. 

Thus, combining

---------------

 these:

s must satisfy:

(s ≡0 mod8 or s≡1 mod8) AND (s≡0 or1 mod3).

Thus

---------------

, possible combinations mod 24 (lcm of8 and3 is24):

Let me consider mod8 and mod3:

mod

---------------

8 options: 0 or1 mod8.

mod3 options:0 or1 mod3.

Total 2*2=4 combinations.

1

---------------

. s≡0 mod8 and s≡0 mod3: solve s≡0 mod24.

2. s≡0 mod8 and s≡1 mod3: s

---------------

≡0 mod8 ⇒ s=8k. 8k≡1 mod3 ⇒ 8≡2 mod3 ⇒2k≡1 mod3 ⇒k≡2 mod3 ⇒k=3m+2 ⇒ s=8*(3m+2)=24m+16 ⇒ s≡16 mod24.

3. s≡1 mod8 and s≡0 mod3: s=8k+1. Then 8k+1≡0 mod3 ⇒8k≡-1 mod3 ⇒2k≡-1 ⇒2k≡2 mod3 ⇒k≡1 mod3 ⇒k=3m+1 ⇒ s=8*(3m+1)+1=24m+9 ⇒ s≡9 mod24.

4. s≡1 mod8 and s≡1 mod3: s≡1 mod24.

Thus the

---------------

 solutions mod24 are residues 0,9,16,1 mod24. 

Thus in the interval s

---------------

 from5 to24, the s that satisfy are:

Numbers congruent to 0,1,9,16 mod24.



---------------

Within 5 to24:

Check residues:

0 mod24:24.

1 mod24:1 (too low),25 (too high).

9 mod24:9, 33 (too high).

16 mod24:16.

Thus s=9,16,24.

Check:



---------------

s=9:9*8=72 divisible by24? 72/24=3 → yes.

s=16:16*15=240 divisible by24 → yes (240/24=10).

s=24:24*23=552 divisible by24? 552/24=23 → yes.

Additionally

---------------

, check if there are other numbers:

Wait, 24 mod24 is 0, so s=24 is included. 

Wait

---------------

, but in the interval 5 to24, so s=9,16,24. So three again. 

Hmm, same

---------------

 count. 

Hmm, maybe need to go higher. Let me try b=31 (d=30). 

d=30, so s from ceil(sqrt(31))≈6 to30. 

We need s(s-1) divisible by30. 

30 factors into 2,3,5. 

Thus s(s-1) divisible by2,3,5. 

Since they are coprime, each

---------------

 prime factor must divide either s or s-1. 

Thus for primes 2,3,5:

Either s≡0 mod2 or s≡1 mod2,

s≡0 mod3 or1 mod3,

s≡0 mod5 or1 mod5.

But

---------------

 since s and s-1 are consecutive, they can't both be even, etc., but the divisibility conditions are that

---------------

 each prime divides exactly one of s or s-1. 

Therefore, the conditions are:

For each prime p in {2,3,5}, s ≡0 mod p or s≡1 mod p. 

Therefore

---------------

, the solutions mod30 (lcm of2,3,5) are all combinations of s≡0 or1 mod2, mod3, mod5. 

Total

---------------

 solutions mod30: 2^3=8 solutions. 

Let me compute them:

Possible residues mod30:

We

---------------

 can build them via Chinese Remainder Theorem. Let me list all 8 possibilities:

1. s≡0 mod2, 0 mod3, 0 mod5 ⇒ s≡0 mod30.

2. s≡0 mod2,0 mod3,1 mod5 ⇒ s

---------------

≡0 mod6, 1 mod5. Solve s=6k≡1 mod5 ⇒6k≡1 mod5 ⇒k≡1 mod5 ⇒k=5m+1 ⇒s=6*(5m+1)=30m+6 ⇒ s≡6 mod30.

3. s≡0 mod2,1 mod3,0 mod5 ⇒ s≡0 mod2,1 mod3,0 mod5. 

s≡

---------------

0 mod2 and0 mod5 ⇒ s≡0 mod10. Also s≡1 mod3. Let s=10k.

---------------

 10k≡1 mod3 ⇒10≡1 mod3 ⇒k≡1 mod3 ⇒k=3m+1 ⇒s=10*(3m+1)=30m+10 ⇒ s≡10 mod30.

4. s≡0 mod2,1 mod3,1 mod5 ⇒ s≡0 mod2,1 mod3,1 mod5.

s≡1 mod3 and1 mod5 ⇒ s≡1 mod15. Also even. So

---------------

 s≡16 mod30 (since 1 mod15 and even: 16 mod30).

5. s≡1 mod2,0 mod3,0 mod5 ⇒ s≡1 mod2,0 mod15 ⇒ s≡15 mod30 (since 15 is odd and divisible by15).

6. s≡1 mod2,0 mod3,1 mod5 ⇒ s≡1 mod2,0 mod3,1 mod5.

s≡0 mod3 and1 mod5 ⇒ s≡6 mod15 (since 6 mod15 is 0 mod3 and 1 mod5?

---------------

 Wait 6 mod5 is1, yes. So s≡6 mod15 and s≡1 mod2. Since

---------------

 6 mod2 is0, so need s≡6+15m ≡1 mod2 ⇒ 6+15m is odd ⇒15m must be odd ⇒ m odd. So

---------------

 m=2k+1 ⇒ s=6+15(2k+1)=30k +21 ⇒ s≡21 mod30.

7. s≡1 mod2,1 mod3,0 mod5 ⇒ s≡1 mod2,1 mod3,0 mod5 ⇒ s≡1

---------------

0 mod15 and 1 mod2. 10 mod2 is0 ⇒ need 10+15m ≡1 mod2 ⇒ 10+

---------------

15m is odd ⇒15m is odd ⇒m odd ⇒ m=2k+1 ⇒ s=10+15*(2k+1)=30k +25 ⇒ s≡25 mod30.

8. s≡1 mod2,1 mod3,1 mod5 ⇒ s≡1 mod lcm(2,3,5)=30 ⇒ s≡1 mod30.

Thus the residues mod30 are: 0,6,10,16,15,21,25,1 mod30.

Therefore, in the interval s=6 to30:

Numbers

---------------

 congruent to 0,1,6,10,15,16,21,25 mod30. 

Let

---------------

 me list them in 6 to30:

- 0 mod30:30.

-1 mod30:1 (too low),31 (too high).

6 mod30:6.

10 mod30:10.

15 mod30:15.

16 mod30:16.

21 mod30:21.

25 mod30:25.

Thus the

---------------

 valid s values are:6,10,15,16,21,25,30. 

Wait, let

---------------

's check each:

s=6:6*5=30 divisible by30 → yes.

s=10:10*9=90 divisible by30 → yes.

s=15:15*14=210 divisible by30 → yes.

s=16:16*15=240 divisible by30 → yes.

s=21:21*20=420 divisible by30 → yes.

s=25:25*24=600 divisible by30 → yes.

s=30:30*29=870 divisible by30 → yes.

Additionally

---------------

, check if 6 is included: yes, since ceil(sqrt(31)) is6. 

So total 7 numbers. 



---------------

Hmm, 7, still under 10. 

Hmm, need higher b. 

Let me try b= 

---------------

49 (d=48). 

d=48. So s from 7 to48. 

Need s(s-1) divisible by48. 

48=16*3=2^4*3.

Thus s

---------------

(s-1) must be divisible by16 and3. 

Divisible by3: s≡0 or1 mod3. 

Divisible by16: since s and s-1 are consecutive, one even, one odd. The even one must be divisible by16, or the even one divisible

---------------

 by 8 and the other divisible by 2? 

Wait, for divisibility by 16: the even term must be divisible by16, since the other term is odd. Because the

---------------

 product s(s-1) has only one even factor, so to have 2^4 divides it, the even term must be divisible by16. 

Thus

---------------

, s ≡0 mod16 or s≡1 mod16. 

Therefore, combining with mod3:

s must satisfy (s ≡0 mod16 or1 mod16) and (s≡0 or1 mod3). 

Thus

---------------

 mod48 (lcm of16 and3 is48). 

Possible combinations:

mod16:0 or1 mod

---------------

16

mod3:0 or1 mod3

Total 2*2=4 combinations mod48:

1. s≡0 mod16 and 0 mod3 ⇒ s≡0 mod48.

2. s≡0 mod16 and1 mod3 ⇒ s≡0 mod16, 

---------------

1 mod3. Let s=16k. 16k≡1 mod3 ⇒16≡1 mod3 ⇒k≡1 mod3 ⇒k=3m+1 ⇒s=16*(3m+1)=48m+16 ⇒ s≡16 mod48.

3. s≡1 mod16 and0 mod3 ⇒ s≡1 mod16, 0 mod3. Let s=16k+1. 16k+1≡0 mod3 ⇒16k≡-1 mod3 ⇒16≡1 ⇒k≡-1 mod3 ⇒k≡2 mod3 ⇒k=3m+2 ⇒ s=16*(3m+2)+1=48m +33 ⇒ s≡33 mod48.

4. s≡1 mod16 and1 mod3 ⇒ s≡1 mod48.

Thus residues mod48:0,16,33,1 mod48.

Thus

---------------

 in the interval s=7 to48:

Numbers congruent to 0,1,16,33 mod48.

Check

---------------

:

0 mod48:48.

1 mod48:1 (too low), 49 (too high).

16 mod48:16, 64 (too high).

33 mod48:33.

Thus s=16,33,48.

Check each

---------------

:

s=16:16*15=240 divisible by48? 240/48=5 → yes.

s=33:33*32=1056 divisible

---------------

 by48? 1056/48=22 → yes.

s=48:48*47=2256 divisible by48? 2256/48=47 → yes.

Additionally

---------------

, check if there's s=1 mod48 in the interval? 1 is too low, next is49,

---------------

 too high. 

Thus only three numbers again. 

Hmm, not helpful. 

Wait, perhaps my approach is not working

---------------

. Maybe I need a different strategy. 

Let me think again of the equation:

a = (s² - s)/(b-1)

Since

---------------

 a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, so:

1 ≤ (s² - s)/(b-1) ≤ b-1

Therefore

---------------

,

s² - s ≥ b -1 

and 

s² - s ≤ (b -1)^2 

Wait

---------------

, let me re-express the inequalities:

First inequality: 

(s² - s) ≥ (b -1) ⇒ s² - s - (b -1) ≥0



---------------

Second inequality:

(s² - s) ≤ (b -1)^2 ⇒ s² - s - (b-1)^2 ≤0

So

---------------

 for each s, these inequalities must hold. 

But since b = d +1 where d = b-1, so

---------------

 substituting b = d +1:

First inequality:

s² - s ≥ d 

Second inequality:

s² - s ≤ d² 

So

---------------

, combining these:

d ≤ s² - s ≤ d² 

Also, s must be between ceil(sqrt(d +1)) and d. 

Hmm

---------------

, perhaps this can help bound s. 

Alternatively, let me consider that for a given d, the possible s must satisfy ceil

---------------

(sqrt(d+1)) ≤ s ≤d, and s² - s must be divisible by d. 

So the number of solutions is the number of s in that interval where d divides s(s-1). 

To

---------------

 find the minimal d where this count exceeds 10. 

Perhaps the number of solutions is maximized when d has many divisors, so that

---------------

 there are many s such that d divides s(s-1). 

So perhaps d needs to be a highly composite number. 

Let me try d=60 (so b=61). 

d=60,

---------------

 so s from ceil(sqrt(61))=8 to60. 

We need s(s-1) divisible by60. 

60 factors into 2²*3*5. 

Thus, s(s-1) divisible by4,3,5. 

Divisible by4: as

---------------

 before, either s≡0 mod4 or s≡1 mod4. 

Divisible by3: s≡0 or1 mod3. 

Divisible by5: s≡0 or1 mod5. 

Therefore, combining

---------------

 these conditions, the solutions mod60 (lcm of4,3,5=60):

Each prime power:



---------------

For mod4:0 or1 mod4.

mod3:0 or1 mod3.

mod5:0 or1 mod5. 

Total solutions mod60: 2^3=8 possibilities

---------------

. 

Wait, but mod4 and mod2 are related. Wait, actually, the mod4 condition is already considering divisibility by4. 

Wait

---------------

, the total combinations are:

mod4:2 choices (0 or1)

mod3:2 choices (0 or1)

mod5:2 choices (0 or1)

Thus total 2^3=8 solutions mod60. 

Let

---------------

 me compute them:

Using Chinese Remainder Theorem:

Let me go through all 8 combinations:

1. s≡0 mod4, 0 mod3, 0 mod5 ⇒ s≡0 mod60.

2. s≡0 mod4,0 mod3,1 mod5 ⇒ s≡0 mod12,1 mod5. 

Let

---------------

 me solve s=12k≡1 mod5 ⇒12k≡1 mod5 ⇒2k≡1 ⇒k≡3 mod5 ⇒k=5m+3 ⇒s=12*(5m+3)=60m+36 ⇒ s≡36 mod60.

3. s≡0 mod4,1 mod3,0 mod5 ⇒ s≡0 mod20,1 mod3. 

s=20k ≡1 mod3 ⇒20k≡2k≡1 mod3 ⇒k≡2 mod3 ⇒k=3m+2 ⇒s=20*(3m+2)=60m+40 ⇒ s≡40 mod60.

4. s≡0 mod4,1 mod3,1 mod5 ⇒ s≡0 mod4,1 mod3,1 mod5.

s≡1 mod3 and1 mod5 ⇒ s≡1 mod15. Also divisible

---------------

 by4. 

Find s≡1 mod15 and0 mod4. 

Let s=15k+1. 

---------------

15k+1≡0 mod4 ⇒15k≡-1 mod4 ⇒3k≡-1 ⇒3k≡3 mod4 ⇒k≡1 mod4 ⇒k=4m+1 ⇒s=15*(4m+1)+1=60m+16 ⇒ s≡16 mod60.

5. s≡1 mod4,0 mod3,0 mod5 ⇒ s≡1 mod4,0 mod15. 

s≡0 mod15 and1 mod4. Let s=15k. 15k≡1 mod4 ⇒15≡3 ⇒3k≡1 mod4 ⇒k≡3 mod4 ⇒k=4m+3 ⇒s=15*(4m+3)=60m+45 ⇒ s≡45 mod60.

6. s≡1 mod4,0 mod3,1 mod5 ⇒ s≡1 mod4,0 mod3,1 mod5. 

s≡0 mod3 and1 mod5 ⇒ s≡6 mod15. Also s

---------------

≡1 mod4. 

s=15k+6. 15k+6≡1 mod4 ⇒15k≡-5 mod4 ⇒3k≡-1 ⇒3k≡3 mod4 ⇒k≡1 mod4 ⇒k=4m+1 ⇒s=15*(4m+1)+6=60m+21 ⇒ s≡21 mod60.

7. s≡1 mod4,1 mod3,0 mod5 ⇒ s≡1 mod4,1 mod3,0 mod5 ⇒ s≡1 mod1

---------------

2 and0 mod5. 

s≡0 mod5 and1 mod12. Let s=5k. 5k≡1 mod12 ⇒5k≡1 ⇒k≡5^{-1}*1 mod12. Since 5*5=25≡1 mod12 ⇒ inverse is5. Thus k≡5 mod12 ⇒k=12m+5 ⇒s=5*(12m+5)=60m+25 ⇒ s≡25 mod60.

8. s≡1 mod4,1 mod3,1 mod5 ⇒ s≡1 mod lcm(4,3,5)=60 ⇒ s≡1 mod60.

Thus residues mod60 are 0,16,21,25,36,40,45,1 mod60. 

Now

---------------

, in the interval s=8 to60:

Numbers congruent to these residues:

0 mod60:60.

1 mod60:1 (too low),61 (too high).

16 mod60:16,76 (too high).

21 mod60:21,81 (too high).

25 mod60:25,85 (too high).

36 mod60:36.

40 mod60:40.

45 mod60:45.

Thus the valid s are:16,21,25,36,40,45,60. 

Wait

---------------

, let me list each residue:

- 0 mod60:60.

-1 mod60:1 (

---------------

too low).

-16 mod60:16.

-21 mod60:21.

-25 mod60:25.

-36 mod60:36.

-40 mod60:40.

-45 mod60:45.

So s=16,21,25,36,40,45,60. That's seven numbers. 

Still under

---------------

 10. 

Hmm, maybe need a higher d. Let me try d= 84 (b=85). 

d=84,

---------------

 so s from ceil(sqrt(85))≈10 to84. 

We need s(s-1) divisible by84. 

84 factors into 2²*3*7. 

Thus divisible

---------------

 by4,3,7. 

Divisible by4: s≡0 or1 mod4.

Divisible by3: s≡0 or1 mod3.

Divisible by7: s≡0 or1 mod7.

Total solutions mod84 (lcm of4,3,7 is84). 

Each

---------------

 of the three conditions has two options, so 2^3=8 solutions mod84. 

Let me compute residues mod84:

Following

---------------

 the same method as before:

1. s≡0 mod4,0 mod3,0 mod7 ⇒ s≡0 mod84.

2. s≡0 mod4,0 mod3,1 mod7 ⇒ s≡0 mod12,1 mod7.

Let s=12k≡1 mod7 ⇒12k≡1 mod7 ⇒5k≡1 ⇒k≡3 mod7 ⇒k=7m+3 ⇒s=12*(7m+3)=84m+36 ⇒ s≡36 mod84.

3. s≡0 mod4,1 mod3,0 mod7 ⇒ s≡0 mod28,1 mod3.

s=28k≡1 mod3 ⇒28≡1 mod3 ⇒k≡1 mod3 ⇒k=3m+1 ⇒s=28*(3m+1)=84m+28 ⇒ s≡28 mod84.

4. s≡0 mod4,1 mod3,1 mod7 ⇒ s≡0 mod4,1 mod3,1 mod7.

s≡1 mod3 and1 mod7 ⇒ s≡1 mod21. Also divisible by4.

Find

---------------

 s≡1 mod21 and0 mod4. Let s=21k+1. 21k+1≡0 mod4 ⇒21k≡-1 mod4 ⇒1k≡-1 ⇒k≡3 mod4 ⇒k=4m+3 ⇒s=21*(4m+3)+1=84m+64 ⇒ s≡64 mod84.

5. s≡1 mod4,0 mod3,0 mod7 ⇒ s≡1 mod4,0 mod21 ⇒ s≡21 mod28 (

---------------

since 21 mod4 is 1). Wait, solving s≡0 mod21 and1 mod4.

s=21k≡1 mod4 ⇒21≡1 mod4 ⇒k≡1 mod4 ⇒k=4m+1 ⇒s=21*(4m+1)=84m+21 ⇒ s≡21 mod84.

6. s≡1 mod4,0 mod3,1 mod7 ⇒ s≡1 mod4,0 mod3,1 mod7.

s≡0 mod3 and1 mod7 ⇒ s≡6 mod21. Also s≡1 mod4.

s=21k+6 ≡1 mod4 ⇒21k +6 ≡(1k +2) mod4 ⇒k+2≡1 ⇒k≡-1≡3 mod4 ⇒k=4m+3 ⇒s=21*(4m+3)+6=84m+69 ⇒ s≡69 mod84.

7. s≡1 mod4,1 mod3,0 mod7 ⇒ s≡1 mod4,1 mod3,0 mod7 ⇒ s≡1 mod12 and0 mod7.

s=7k≡1 mod12. Let

---------------

 me solve 7k ≡1 mod12 ⇒7^{-1} mod12 is7 since 7*7=49≡1 mod12 ⇒k≡7 mod12 ⇒k=12m+7 ⇒s=7*(12m+7)=84m+49 ⇒ s≡49 mod84.

8. s≡1 mod4,1 mod3,1 mod7 ⇒ s≡1 mod lcm(4,3,7)=84 ⇒ s≡1 mod84.

Thus residues mod84:0,21,28,36,49,64,69,1 mod84.

Now

---------------

, s ranges from10 to84:

Check residues:

0 mod84:84.

1 mod84:1 (too low),85 (too high).

21 mod84:21.

28 mod84:28.

36 mod84:36.

49 mod84:49.

64 mod84:64.

69 mod84:69.

Thus the valid s are:21,28,36,49,64,69,84. 

Wait

---------------

, that's seven numbers again. 

Hmm. Maybe I need to consider d with more prime factors. 

Wait, maybe

---------------

 d= 120 (b=121). 

d=120 factors into 2^3*3*5. 

So

---------------

 s(s-1) must be divisible by8,3,5. 

Divisible by8: s≡0 mod8 or1 mod8.

Divisible by3:0 or1 mod3.

Divisible by5:0 or1 mod5. 

Thus total

---------------

 solutions mod120 (lcm of8,3,5)=120. 

Number of solutions:2^3=8.



---------------

Wait, but mod8 has two options, mod3 two, mod5 two. 

Total 2×2×2=8 solutions mod120. 

Let

---------------

 me compute residues:

This will take time, but let's try some:

1. s≡0 mod8,0 mod3,0 mod5 ⇒0 mod120.

2. s≡0 mod8,0 mod3,1 mod5 ⇒0 mod24,1 mod5 ⇒ solving

---------------

 s=24k≡1 mod5 ⇒24k≡1 mod5 ⇒4k≡1 ⇒k≡4 mod5 ⇒k=5m+4 ⇒s=24*(5m+4)=120m+96 ⇒9

---------------

6 mod120.

3. s≡0 mod8,1 mod3,0 mod5 ⇒0 mod40,1 mod3 ⇒4

---------------

0k≡1 mod3 ⇒1k≡1 ⇒k≡1 mod3 ⇒k=3m+1 ⇒s=40*(3m+1)=120m+40 ⇒40 mod120.

4. s≡0 mod8,1 mod3,1 mod5 ⇒0 mod8,1 mod15 ⇒ solving

---------------

 s≡1 mod15 and0 mod8. Let s=15k+1≡0 mod8 ⇒15k≡-1 mod8 ⇒7k≡7 ⇒k≡1 mod8 ⇒k=8m+1 ⇒s=15*(8m+1)+1=120m+16 ⇒16 mod120.

5. s≡1 mod8,0 mod3,0 mod5 ⇒1 mod8,0 mod15 ⇒ s

---------------

=15k≡1 mod8 ⇒15≡7 ⇒7k≡1 mod8 ⇒k≡7^{-1}*1 mod8 ⇒7^{-1}=7 ⇒

---------------

k≡7 mod8 ⇒k=8m+7 ⇒s=15*(8m+7)=120m+105 ⇒105 mod120.

6. s≡1 mod8,0 mod3,1 mod5 ⇒1 mod8,0 mod3,1 mod5 ⇒0

---------------

 mod3 and1 mod5 ⇒0 mod15 and1 mod8. Let s=15k≡1 mod8 ⇒15k≡1 ⇒7k≡1 ⇒k≡7^{-1}*1 mod

---------------

8 ⇒7*7=49≡1 ⇒k≡7 mod8 ⇒k=8m+7 ⇒s=15*(8m+7)=120m+105 ⇒1

---------------

05 mod120. Wait, same as previous? Hmm, perhaps miscalculation.

Wait, let me re

---------------

-express:

s≡0 mod3 and1 mod5 ⇒ s≡6 mod15. Also s≡1 mod8. 

So

---------------

 s=15k+6≡1 mod8 ⇒15k +6 ≡(7k +6) mod8 ⇒7k +6 ≡1 ⇒7k≡-5≡3 mod8 ⇒k≡3*7^{-1} mod8 ⇒7^{-1}=7 ⇒3*7=21≡5 mod8 ⇒ so

---------------

 k≡5 mod8 ⇒k=8m+5 ⇒s=15*(8m+5)+6=120m+81 ⇒81 mod120.

7

---------------

. s≡1 mod8,1 mod3,0 mod5 ⇒1 mod8,1 mod3,0 mod5 ⇒ s

---------------

≡1 mod24 and0 mod5. 

s=24k +1≡0 mod5 ⇒24k≡-1 mod5 ⇒4k≡-1 ⇒4k≡4 ⇒k≡1 mod5 ⇒k=5m+1 ⇒s=24*(5m+1)+1=120m+25 ⇒25 mod120.

8. s≡1 mod8,1 mod3,1 mod5 ⇒ s≡1 mod lcm(8,3,5)=120 ⇒1 mod120.

Thus residues mod120 are 0,16,25,40,96,81,105,1 mod120.

Now

---------------

, s from ceil(sqrt(121))=11 to120.

Check which residues fall in that interval:

0 mod120:120.

1 mod120:1 (too low).

16 mod120:16.

25 mod120:25.

40 mod120:40.

81 mod120:81.

96 mod120:96.

105 mod120:105.

Thus the valid s are:16,25,40,81,96,105,120. 

Total

---------------

 of seven numbers again. 

Hmm, still not enough. 

Wait, perhaps I need a different approach. Let me think of

---------------

 the equation again:

We have s(s-1) divisible by (b-1). To have many solutions s in the interval [

---------------

sqrt(b), b-1], perhaps (b-1) should be a number that has many factors, so that there

---------------

 are many s in that interval divisible by (b-1) or s-1 divisible by (b-1). But since

---------------

 s and s-1 are coprime, (b-1) must split into factors that divide s and s-1. 

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 (b-1) is a factorial number, which has many factors. Let me try b= 40321 (d

---------------

=40320), but that's too big. 

Alternatively, maybe the minimal b is 242?

---------------

 Not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps consider that the number of solutions is approximately the number of divisors of (b-1). 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps consider that for (b-1) being a factorial number like 6! =720. 

Wait, let me try b=721 (d=720). 

d

---------------

=720. 

s from ceil(sqrt(721))≈27 to720.

We need s(s-1) divisible by720. 

720 factors into 2^4*3^2*5. 

Thus

---------------

, divisible by16,9,5. 

Divisible by16: s≡0 mod16 or1 mod16.

Divisible by9: s≡0 mod9 or1 mod9.

Divisible by5: s≡0 mod5 or1 mod5.

Thus

---------------

, solutions mod720 (lcm of16,9,5)=720.

Total solutions mod720: 2×

---------------

2×2=8. 

Hmm, same as before, but with more residues. 

But even so, the number of solutions in the large interval would

---------------

 be 720/720 *8=8, but spread over a large interval, so maybe more.

---------------

 

Wait, but in reality, the number of solutions in [sqrt(d)+1, d] would be roughly d/(l

---------------

cm of mod) * number of solutions mod, but since mod is d itself, it's 1 full period. So the

---------------

 number of solutions is exactly the number of solutions mod d, which is 8. 

Hmm, this isn't scaling up. 

Perhaps my

---------------

 initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the number of solutions isn't dependent on the number of factors but something else. 

Wait, let

---------------

's think of the equation s(s-1) divisible by (b-1). 

Let me consider that (b-1) divides s(s-1). Since

---------------

 s and s-1 are coprime, then (b-1) must be a product of two coprime divisors, one dividing s and the other dividing s-1. 

Therefore

---------------

, the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to factor (b-1) into two coprime factors

---------------

, and for each factor pair (d, e) where d*e=(b-1), d divides s and e divides s-1 or vice versa. 

Each

---------------

 such factorization gives two solutions (except when d=e=1, but since they are coprime, d and e must be 1 and (b-1)). 

The

---------------

 number of coprime pairs (d,e) with d*e=(b-1) is 2^{k}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of (b-1). 



---------------

Therefore, the number of solutions mod (b-1) is 2^{k}. 

Hence, the total number of s in the interval [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] is

---------------

 approximately 2^{k} * (b-1)/b ≈ 2^{k}. 

To have more than 10 solutions, we need 2^{k} >10 ⇒k≥4. 

Thus

---------------

, the minimal b-1 must have at least four distinct prime factors. 

The smallest number with four distinct prime factors is 2×3×5×7=210. 

Therefore, if

---------------

 b-1=210, then b=211. 

Let me check this case. 

Take b=211 (d=210). 

d

---------------

=210 has prime factors 2,3,5,7. 

Thus, the number of solutions mod210 is 2^4=16. 

Thus, in the interval s from ceil(sqrt(211))≈15 to210, there are 16 solutions. 

Therefore

---------------

, the number of b-eautiful numbers is 16, which is more than 10. 

Is there a smaller b?

---------------

 

The next smaller numbers with four distinct prime factors are: 

The next after 210 is 2×3×5×11=330 (b

---------------

=331), which is larger. 

Alternatively, numbers like 2×3×5×7=210, 

---------------

2×3×5×11=330, 2×3×7×5= same as 210, so the next is 330. 

Therefore

---------------

, the minimal d is 210, so minimal b is211. 

Wait, but maybe there is a number with four

---------------

 prime factors but smaller than210? 

Wait, 2×3×5×7=210 is the smallest with four distinct primes. 

Therefore

---------------

, the minimal b is211. 

But let me verify this with an example. 

Take d=210 (b=211). 

The

---------------

 number of solutions mod210 is 2^4=16. 

So there are 16 solutions between

---------------

 1 and210. 

The interval we need is from ceil(sqrt(211))=15 to210. 

Thus

---------------

 the number of solutions is 16 minus those below15. 

How many solutions are below15? 

The

---------------

 residues mod210 must be checked. 

The solutions mod210 are all combinations of s≡0 or1 mod2,3,5,7. 

Each

---------------

 prime factor gives a choice of s≡0 or1 mod p. 

Therefore, there are 16 residues mod210. 

The

---------------

 numbers below15 would be s=1,2,...,14. 

Check which of these satisfy s(s-1) divisible by210. 

Since

---------------

 210=2×3×5×7. 

For s between1-14, s(s-1) must be divisible by2,3,5,7. 

But

---------------

 since s and s-1 are small, it's unlikely except for s=1 and s=0 (but s starts

---------------

 at1). 

Check s=1:1×0=0 divisible by210? Well, technically yes, but s must be at least ceil(sqrt(b))=15.

---------------

 So s=1 is too low. 

Similarly s=0 is not considered. 

Thus, all 16 solutions are in the interval from

---------------

1 to210, but excluding those below15. 

Thus, the number of s from15 to210 is16 minus the

---------------

 solutions below15. 

But since s=1 is the only possible solution below15, which is excluded, so the

---------------

 count is16-1=15. 

Wait, but maybe there are more solutions below15. 

Let me check each

---------------

 s from1 to14:

For s=1:1×0=0 divisible by210 → yes, but s=1 is below15. 

s=2:2×1=2 not divisible by210.

s=3:3×2=6 not divisible by210.

s=4:4×3=12 not divisible by210.

s=5:5×4=20 not divisible by210.

s=6:6×5=30 not divisible by210.

s=7:7×6=42 not divisible by210.

s=8:8×7=56 not divisible by210.

s=9:9×8=72 not divisible by210.

s=10:10×9=90 not divisible by210.

s=11:11×10=110 not divisible by210.

s=12:12×11=132 not divisible by210.

s=13:13×12=156 not divisible by210.

s=14:14×13=182 not divisible by210.

Thus, only s=1 is a solution below15. 

Therefore, in the interval1

---------------

5 to210, there are16 -1=15 solutions. 

Hmm, which is still under10? No, 15 is more than10. 

Wait, so

---------------

 b=211 gives15 b-eautiful numbers. 

Is there a smaller b with four prime factors? 

Wait, maybe

---------------

 a number with three prime factors but with exponents allowing more solutions? 

Wait, let me check b= 105+1=106 (d=105). 

d=105 has

---------------

 prime factors3,5,7. 

Thus solutions mod105 would be 2^3=8. 

Thus

---------------

, in the interval ceil(sqrt(106))≈11 to105:

Total solutions mod105:

---------------

8. 

Subtract those below11:

Check s=1,…,10:

s=1: yes, but too low.

s

---------------

= others: none divisible by105. 

Thus, 8-1=7 <10. 

Not

---------------

 enough. 

What about b= 120+1=121 (d=120). 

Wait

---------------

, d=120 has prime factors2,3,5. 

Thus solutions mod120 are 2^3=8. 

Which

---------------

 we already saw gives7 solutions in the interval. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, perhaps b= 84+1=85 (d=84)

---------------

 which had7 solutions. 

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal is indeed211. 

Wait, but let's check b

---------------

= 105+1=106 (d=105). 

Wait, 105 has 3 distinct

---------------

 primes, so 8 solutions mod105. 

Thus, in the interval from11 to105, 

---------------

8 solutions minus those below11. 

Only s=1 is a solution below11. 

Thus 7, still

---------------

 under10. 

Thus, the next candidate is211. 

Wait, but let me check d= 120.

---------------

 

Wait, d=120 has four prime factors? No, factors are2,3,5. 

So

---------------

 three primes. 

Thus, the first d with four distinct primes is210. 

Thus, b=211 is the minimal. 

Therefore

---------------

, the answer is211. 

Wait, but the problem says "the least integer b ≥ 2 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers". 

Wait

---------------

, but according to my calculation for b=211, there are15 solutions. 

Is there a smaller b with four prime factors? 

Wait, 

---------------

2×3×5×7=210. 

The next smaller number with four prime factors would require primes smaller

---------------

 than2,3,5,7, but those are the first four primes. So 2×3×5×7=210 is the smallest composite number with four distinct prime factors. 

Therefore, the

---------------

 minimal b is211. 

Hence, the answer is \boxed{211}

Wait, but let

---------------

 me check with b= 210+1=211. 

Wait, let me confirm with d=210.

---------------

 

The number of solutions mod210 is 16. 

In the interval from15 to210, there

---------------

 are16 solutions minus those below15. 

Only s=1 is a solution below15, so 16-1=15 solutions

---------------

. 

15>10, so yes. 

Is there a smaller d with more solutions? 

Wait, what

---------------

 about d= 120, which had 8 solutions. 

Wait, but if d= 180 (b=181). 

d=180 factors into 2²×3²×5. 

Prime

---------------

 factors are2,3,5 (three distinct primes). 

Thus, solutions mod180 would be 2^3=8. 

Thus

---------------

, in the interval from ceil(sqrt(181))=14 to180. 

Total solutions mod180:8. 

Subtract solutions below14:

---------------

 s=1 only. 

Thus, 7 again. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, d= 210 is the first with four distinct

---------------

 primes. 

Therefore, I think the minimal b is211. 

But the problem might have a smaller answer. Maybe

---------------

 my assumption is wrong. 

Wait, let me check d= 60 (b=61). 

Earlier,

---------------

 d=60 had8 solutions mod60, giving7 solutions in the interval. 

Wait, but 60 has prime

---------------

 factors2,3,5 (three primes). 

Thus, solutions mod60:2^3=8. 

Which

---------------

 gave7 in the interval. 

Hmm, but 2^4=16 is needed for four primes. 

Alternatively

---------------

, maybe my initial assumption is incorrect. 

Wait, perhaps the count isn't exactly 2^{number of prime factors}. 

Wait, when

---------------

 we have four primes, the number of solutions mod d is 2^4=16. 

But in the case of d=210, that

---------------

's correct. 

Thus, the first time the count exceeds10 is at d=210 (b=211), with

---------------

15 solutions. 

Thus, I think the answer is211. 

But I need to confirm with an example. 

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps there is a smaller number with multiple exponents allowing more solutions. 

Wait, take d= 240 (b=241). 

Prime factors2

---------------

^4*3*5. 

Thus distinct primes are2,3,5. 

Thus solutions mod240:

---------------

2^3=8. 

Thus, in the interval sqrt(241)=~16 to240:

---------------

 

Total solutions mod240:8. 

Subtract solutions below16: s=1. 

Thus,7 again. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, d

---------------

= 360 (b=361). 

Prime factors2^3*3^2*5. 

Distinct primes:2,3,5. 

Thus

---------------

 solutions mod360:8. 

Same as before. 

Hmm, so seems like the minimal is indeed211. 

Thus

---------------

, I think the answer is211.


To determine the least integer \( b \geq 2 \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful integers, we analyze the conditions for a number \( n \) to be \( b \)-eautiful. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-eautiful if it has exactly two digits in base \( b \), and

---------------

 the sum of these digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \). 

Expressing \( n \) in base \( b \) as \( n = a \cdot b + c \), where \( a \) and \( c \) are digits (with \( 1 \leq a \leq b-1 \) and \( 0 \leq c \leq b-1 \)), we need

---------------

 \( a + c = \sqrt{n} \). Substituting \( n = (a + c)^2 \), we derive the equation:
\[
(a + c)^2 = a \cdot b + c
\]
Rearranging and simplifying, we find:
\[
a = \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \quad \text{where} \quad s = a + c = \sqrt{n}
\]
For \( a \) to be an integer, \( b - 1 \) must divide \( s(s - 1) \). The number of valid \( s \) values (and thus \( b \)-eautiful numbers) depends on the number of divisors of \( b - 1 \).

To have more than ten \( b \)-eautiful numbers, \( b - 1 \) must have enough divisors to allow at

---------------

 least 11 solutions for \( s \). The smallest \( b - 1 \) with four distinct prime factors (ensuring \( 2^4 = 16 \) solutions modulo \( b - 1 \)) is \( 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 = 210 \). Thus, \( b = 210 + 1 = 211 \).

Verification shows \( b = 211 \) yields

---------------

 15 solutions (more than ten), confirming it as the minimal \( b \).

\boxed{211}<|im_end|>
