Okay, so I need to solve this problem about rectangular boxes with a given surface area and volume, and then find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. The answer should be in the form p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p+q. Alright, let's start breaking this down.

First, the problem mentions rectangular

---------------

 boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. Let me recall the formulas for surface area and volume of a rectangular box. If the box has dimensions

---------------

 x, y, z, then the surface area S is 2(xy + yz + zx), and the volume V is xyz. So here

---------------

, we have:

2(xy + yz + zx) = 54  
xyz = 23

Our goal is to find the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. The radius of such a sphere would be half of the space diagonal of the box, right? Because the sphere has to contain the entire box, so the diameter of the sphere must be at least the space diagonal of the box. Therefore, the minimal radius r for a particular box would be (1/2)*sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So

---------------

, we need to minimize the space diagonal sqrt(x² + y² + z²) over all boxes in set B, and then take half of that minimal

---------------

 diagonal to get r, and then compute r².

Wait, but actually, hold on. The problem says "the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B". Hmm, does that mean that the sphere has to contain all the boxes in B simultaneously, or that

---------------

 for each box in B, we need the minimal sphere containing it, and then find the minimal r among all those? Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read again:

"the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B"

Hmm, that

---------------

 sounds like a single sphere that contains all the boxes in B. But that might not be possible unless all boxes in B are the

---------------

 same. But since B is defined as all boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23, there are multiple boxes,

---------------

 so unless they all have the same dimensions, which they probably don't. Wait, but maybe the problem is asking for, for each box in B, compute the minimal sphere that contains it, then take the minimal r over all those,

---------------

 i.e., the minimal radius needed to contain any of the boxes in B. That would make sense. Because if it had

---------------

 to contain all of them in one sphere, the problem would have to specify, but the wording is "can contain each of the rectangular boxes", so maybe

---------------

 each one individually. So probably, we need to find the minimal possible r such that every box in B is contained in a sphere of radius r. But

---------------

 actually, since each box can be contained in a sphere with radius half its space diagonal, then the minimal such r would be the maximum of (space diagonal)/2 over all boxes in B. Because if

---------------

 we need a sphere that can contain all boxes in B, then the radius has to be at least as big as the maximum of the

---------------

 individual minimal radii. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for each box in B, find the minimal sphere that contains it, then find

---------------

 the minimal r over all such spheres? But that would be the minimal r among all the (space diagonals)/2, but since different

---------------

 boxes have different diagonals, we need to find the minimal possible r such that all boxes can be contained in a sphere of radius r. Wait

---------------

, but the wording is "the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B". So the

---------------

 sphere must contain each box individually. Wait, but that's redundant because the minimal sphere for each box is the one with radius half the space diagonal. So

---------------

 the radius r must be at least the maximum of (space diagonal)/2 over all boxes in B. Therefore, the minimal such r is the maximum of (space diagonal)/2 over all boxes in B. So

---------------

 we need to find the maximum possible space diagonal of any box in B, then divide by 2, square that, and get

---------------

 r².

Therefore, the problem reduces to: given all rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23, find the maximum value of sqrt(x² + y² + z²), then compute (sqrt(x² + y² + z²)/2)^2, which is (x² + y² + z²)/4. Therefore

---------------

, we need to maximize x² + y² + z² given 2(xy + yz + zx)=54 and xyz=23. Then

---------------

 r² would be (max(x² + y² + z²))/4, and then compute that as a fraction and add

---------------

 numerator and denominator.

So, the key is to maximize x² + y² + z² given the constraints on surface area and volume. Let me note

---------------

 that x, y, z are positive real numbers satisfying:

2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 ⇒ xy + yz + zx = 27,

and xyz = 23.

We need to maximize x² + y² + z².

Hmm. To

---------------

 maximize x² + y² + z² given these constraints. Let me recall that for variables with fixed sum of products and fixed product, how

---------------

 can we approach this?

Alternatively, perhaps we can use Lagrange multipliers here. Let me consider the function f(x,y,z) = x² + y² + z², with constraints g(x,y,z) = xy + yz + zx = 27 and h(x,y,z) = xyz = 23.

Alternatively

---------------

, maybe express variables in terms of each other.

Alternatively, perhaps consider variables as roots of a cubic equation. Let me think.

---------------

 Let me suppose that x, y, z are the roots of the cubic equation t³ - at² + bt - c = 0. Then, we

---------------

 know that:

a = x + y + z,

b = xy + yz + zx = 27,

c = xyz = 23.

Therefore, the

---------------

 cubic would be t³ - a t² + 27 t - 23 = 0.

We need to maximize x² + y² + z², which is equal to (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx) = a² - 2*27 = a² - 54.

Therefore, to maximize x² + y² + z², we need to maximize a², since

---------------

 54 is fixed. So, the problem reduces to maximizing a = x + y + z, given that xy + yz + zx = 27 and xyz = 23.

Therefore, we

---------------

 need to maximize x + y + z given those constraints. So, now the problem becomes: given that for positive real numbers x, y, z,

xy + yz + zx = 27,

xyz = 23,

find the maximum possible value of x + y + z.

Hmm, okay

---------------

. So perhaps we can use inequalities here. Let me think. Since we have three variables with constraints on their pairwise products and product. Let

---------------

 me see.

Alternatively, fix two variables and express the third in terms of them, then try to maximize. Let me try

---------------

 to set variables such that two variables are equal, perhaps? Because often in optimization problems with symmetry, the extremum occurs at symmetric

---------------

 points or when variables are equal. But given that xyz is fixed and xy + yz + zx is fixed, maybe the

---------------

 maximum of x + y + z occurs when two variables are equal? Let me check.

Suppose two variables are equal, say y = z. Then let me set variables as x, y, y. Then:



---------------

Surface area equation: xy + y^2 + xy = 2xy + y² = 27,

Volume equation: x y² = 23,

We need to maximize x + 2y.

Let me solve

---------------

 for x from the volume equation: x = 23/(y²).

Substitute into the surface area equation: 2*(23/(y²))*y + y² = 2*(23/y) + y² = 27.

So equation

---------------

 becomes 46/y + y² = 27 ⇒ y² + 46/y = 27.

Multiply both sides by y to eliminate denominator (assuming y ≠ 0):

y³ + 46 = 27y ⇒ y³ -27y +46 =0.

Hmm, need

---------------

 to solve cubic equation y³ -27y +46 =0.

Let me try possible rational roots. By rational root theorem, possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing y=2: 8 -54 +46 = 0 →

---------------

 0. So y=2 is a root. Great.

Therefore, factor out (y - 2):

Divide polynomial y³ -27y +46 by (y -2):

Using polynomial division or synthetic division.

Using synthetic division:

2 | 1  0  -27  46

          2   4  -46

        1  2  -23   0

So the

---------------

 quotient is y² + 2y -23. Therefore, the equation factors as (y -2)(y² +2y -23)=0. The other roots are solutions to y² +2y -23=0,

---------------

 which are y = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2√6. Since y must be positive, only

---------------

 y = -1 + 2√6 ≈ -1 + 4.898 ≈ 3.898 is

---------------

 positive. But let's check if that works.

But since we are looking for real positive roots, so possible y values are 2 and -

---------------

1 + 2√6. Let's compute both.

First, y=2:

Then x =23/(y²)=23/4=5.75,



---------------

so x=23/4, y=2, z=2.

Then sum x +2y =23/4 +4 = (23 +16)/4 =39/4=9.75.

Second

---------------

, y= -1 +2√6 ≈3.898:

Let me compute y exactly first. Let me denote

---------------

 y = -1 + 2√6. Let's compute x:

x =23/y². Let's compute y²:

y = -1 + 2√6,

y² = (-1)^2 + (2√6)^2 + 2*(-1)(2√6) = 1 + 24 -4√6 =25 -4√6,

So

---------------

 x =23/(25 -4√6). To rationalize denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

x =23*(25 +4√6)/[(25)^2 - (4√6)^2] =23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 96)=23*(25 +4√6)/529=

---------------

 (25 +4√6)/23.

Therefore, x = (25 +4√6)/23,

and y

---------------

 = -1 +2√6,

so the sum x +2y is:

(25 +4√6)/23 +2*(-1 +2√6) = [25 +4√6)/23] + [ -2 +4√6 ]

Convert

---------------

 to common denominator:

= [25 +4√6 -46 + 92√6]/23

Wait, let me compute step by step:

First term: (25 +4√6)/23,

Second term: 2*(-1 +2√6) = -2 +4√6,

So

---------------

 total sum:

(25 +4√6)/23 + (-2 +4√6) = (25 +4√6 -46 + 92√6)/23?

---------------

 Wait, no, perhaps better to convert the second term to over 23:

-2 is -46/23,

and 4√6 is (4√6 *23)/23,



---------------

Wait, actually, better to write:

Let me compute:

(25 +4√6)/23 + (-2) +4√6

= (25 +4√6 -46)/23 +4√6

= (-21 +4√6)/23 +4√6

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 this is messy. Alternatively, maybe just compute numerically?

Compute y = -1 +2√6 ≈-1 +4.89898≈3.89898,

then x =23/y²≈

---------------

23/( (3.89898)^2 )≈23/(15.199)≈1.514,

Then

---------------

 sum x +2y≈1.514 + 2*3.898≈1.514 +7.796≈9.31.

---------------

 Which is less than 9.75. Hmm, so the first solution y=2 gives a larger sum. Therefore, the

---------------

 maximum of x+y+z when two variables are equal is 39/4=9.75.

But is this the global maximum? Or

---------------

 is there a higher sum when variables are not equal?

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when variables are not equal. Let me check

---------------

.

Alternatively, let's see if we can use Lagrange multipliers here.

Let me set up the problem: maximize f(x,y,z)=x+y+z,

subject to constraints:

g(x,y,z)=xy + yz + zx =27,

h(x,y,z)=xyz=23.

Using

---------------

 Lagrange multipliers, we set up the gradients:

∇f = λ∇g + μ∇h,

Which gives the equations:

1 = λ(y + z) + μ(yz),

1 = λ(x + z) + μ(xz),

1 = λ(x + y) + μ(xy).

Hmm, this seems

---------------

 complicated. Alternatively, perhaps assume two variables are equal again. Wait, but since in the case when two variables are equal, we get

---------------

 a higher sum, maybe that's the maximum? Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let me note

---------------

 that for positive real numbers x, y, z, with fixed xy + yz + zx and fixed xyz, the sum x + y + z can be maximized when variables are as unequal as possible? Hmm

---------------

, but in this case, when two variables are equal, we got a higher value than the other solution, so maybe that

---------------

's the maximum. Let me check another case where variables are unequal.

Suppose, for instance, let me try to set one variable very small, approaching

---------------

 zero. Let me see if that can give a larger sum.

Suppose z approaches 0. Then, the volume xyz=

---------------

23 would require that xy approaches infinity, which is impossible since surface area 2(xy + yz + zx)=54.

---------------

 If z approaches 0, then the surface area becomes approximately 2xy =54, so xy=27. Then the volume xyz

---------------

≈0, but we need volume 23, so that's impossible. So z can't be too small. Similarly, variables can't be too large or too small.

---------------

 So perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal as we considered before.

Alternatively, let me consider the cubic equation whose roots are x, y, z. Since

---------------

 x, y, z are roots of t^3 - a t² +27 t -23=0, where a = x + y + z. Then

---------------

, for real roots to exist, the cubic must have three real roots. The discriminant of the cubic must be non-negative.

The discriminant D of cubic equation t³ + pt² + qt + r =0 is given by D = 18pqr -4p³r + p²q² -4q³ -27r². Wait, actually

---------------

, let me recall the formula correctly. Wait, perhaps better to use the standard discriminant formula for cubic ax³ +bx² +cx +d.

---------------

 The discriminant is Δ = 18abcd -4b³d + b²c² - 4ac³ -27a²d². Hmm

---------------

, but in our case, the cubic is t³ - a t² +27 t -23. So coefficients are:

a_coeff

---------------

 =1,

b_coeff = -a,

c_coeff =27,

d_coeff = -23.

So the discriminant Δ would be:

18*(1)*(-a)*(27)*(-23) -4*(-a)^3*(-23) + (-a)^2*(27)^2 -4*(1)*(27)^3 -27*(1)^2*(-23)^2.

This is going

---------------

 to be very complicated, but maybe we can use this to find the condition on a for real roots. Since we need real

---------------

 roots (since x,y,z are real positive numbers), the discriminant must be non-negative. However, this might not be the easiest path.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 use the method of substitution. Let me consider variables u = x + y + z = a, v = xy + yz + zx =27, w = xyz=23.

We can

---------------

 recall that for three variables,

(x - y)^2 + (y - z)^2 + (z - x)^2 = 2(a² - 3v),



---------------

so to have real variables, the right-hand side must be non-negative, but since variables are positive, but this might not directly

---------------

 help here.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that in order to maximize a = x + y + z, given that v is fixed and w is fixed. Let

---------------

 me see if there's an inequality that relates a, v, and w.

Alternatively, perhaps use the AM ≥ GM inequality.

---------------

 Let me see:

We have xyz =23, so GM = (23)^{1/3} ≈2.84

---------------

3.

But how does that relate to the sum?

Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize variables. Let me suppose that variables are x

---------------

, y, z, with xyz=23 and xy + yz + zx=27.

Let me try to set

---------------

 variables in terms of two variables. Let me fix x and y, then z =23/(xy). Then substitute into the surface area equation:

xy + y*(23/(xy)) + x*(23/(xy)) =27,

S

---------------

implify:

xy + 23/x +23/y =27.

Hmm, so this equation in x and y.

---------------

 But solving this for maximum x + y + z =x + y +23/(xy).

This seems a bit involved

---------------

, but maybe we can set x = y to find the case when two variables are equal, which we already did, and

---------------

 that gave us a solution. Alternatively, perhaps set x = ky, so express in terms of y and k. Let me try that.

Let x =k y, so then z=23/(x y)=23/(k y²).

Then,

---------------

 substitute into the surface area equation:

xy + y z +x z = y*(k y) + y*(23/(k y²)) + (k y)*(23/(k y²)) = k y² + 23/(k y) +23/y =27.

Let

---------------

 me write this as:

k y² + (23/k +23)/y =27.

Let me denote t

---------------

 = y, so:

k t² + (23/k +23)/t =27.

This is an equation in t for given k. To

---------------

 maximize the sum x + y + z =k y + y +23/(k y²) = y(k +1) +23/(k y²).

Hmm

---------------

, this might be complicated, but perhaps choosing k=1 (so x=y) gives the case we considered earlier. Let

---------------

 me check for another k. Let me suppose k=2, so x=2y.

Then z=23/(2y²).

Surface

---------------

 area equation:

2y² + (23/2 +23)/y =2y² + (69/2)/y =27.

So

---------------

 2y² + (69)/(2y)=27.

Multiply both sides by 2y: 4y³ +69 =54y ⇒4y³ -54y +69=0.

Hmm

---------------

, need to solve this cubic. Maybe try rational roots. Possible roots: ±1, ±3, etc.

Testing y=3: 4*27 -54*3 +69 =108 -162 +69=15≠0.

y= 1

---------------

: 4 -54 +69=19≠0,

y= 2: 32 -108 +69= -7≠0,

y= 1.5: 4*(3.375) -54*(1.5)+69=13.5 -81 +69=1.5≈

---------------

1.5≠0,

Hmm, not obvious. Maybe not a nice solution, so perhaps not the maximum. Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 this path is too complicated.

Alternatively, let me think again about the case when two variables are equal gives a higher sum.

---------------

 Since when variables are equal, that is, when x=y=z, would that be possible? Let me check if that's possible.

Suppose x=y=z. Then surface

---------------

 area would be 6x²=54 ⇒x²=9 ⇒x=3. Volume would be x³=27, but given

---------------

 that volume is 23, which is less than 27, so that's not possible. So the cube case is not in our set B. Therefore, the variables

---------------

 cannot all be equal. So the maximum must occur when two variables are equal, as we considered earlier?

Alternatively, perhaps the

---------------

 maximum occurs when one variable is as large as possible, and others adjusted accordingly. Let me see.

Alternatively, let me think

---------------

 in terms of the cubic equation. Let me suppose that the cubic equation t³ - a t² +27 t -23=0 has three real positive roots. The maximum possible a (

---------------

sum of roots) would occur when the cubic has a double root and another root. Because for a cubic, the extremal values of the sum (

---------------

when keeping product and sum of products fixed) might occur at a double root.

Wait, perhaps that's a better approach. Let me consider

---------------

 when two variables are equal, so the cubic has a double root. Let me suppose that two roots are equal, say y = z. Then as before, we have the cubic equation with

---------------

 a double root at y and another root x. Let me see.

Suppose the cubic has a double root at y and another root x. Then, the cubic can be written as (t - y)^2(t - x). Expanding this:

(t² - 2 y t + y²)(t - x) = t³ - (2y +x)t² + (y² + 2xy)t -x y².

Comparing to our cubic equation t³ -a t² +27 t -23=

---------------

0,

We have:

- Coefficient of t²: -(2y +x) = -a ⇒ a =2y +x,

- Coefficient of t: y² +2xy =27,

- Constant term: -x y² = -23 ⇒x y²=23.

So

---------------

, same equations as before when we set two variables equal. Therefore, the case when two variables are equal corresponds to the cubic having a double root, which would

---------------

 be a critical point for the sum a =x + y + z. Therefore, perhaps this is the maximum or minimum?

To

---------------

 determine whether this is a maximum or minimum, perhaps consider the other solution when y is the other root, which gave a smaller a. So

---------------

, in this case, when the cubic has a double root, there are two possibilities: one gives a higher a and the other a lower a. Since

---------------

 in our previous calculation, when y=2, a was 39/4≈9.75, and the other solution gave a≈9.31, which is lower. Therefore, the case with y=2 gives

---------------

 the maximum a.

Therefore, the maximum a is 39/4, so the maximum x² + y² + z² is a² -54 = (39/4)^2 -54.

Let me compute that:

(39/4)^2 = (39)^2 /16 = 1521/16,

then

---------------

 subtract 54 = 54*(16/16)=864/16,

so 1521/16 - 864/16 = (1521 -864)/16 = 657/16.

Therefore, x² + y² + z² =

---------------

657/16,

Thus, the space diagonal squared is 657/16, so the radius squared is (657/16)/4 =657/64.

Wait, hold on: radius

---------------

 is half the space diagonal, so radius squared is ( (sqrt(x² + y² + z²)/2 )^2 = (x² + y² + z²)/4. So

---------------

 yes, 657/16 divided by 4 is 657/64. So r²=657/64.

But

---------------

 wait, we need to confirm that this is indeed the maximum. Since we found that when two variables are equal, the sum a can

---------------

 reach 39/4, and that this is higher than the other critical point. Since the problem is to find the maximum possible

---------------

 x² + y² + z², then 657/16 is the maximum, so r² is 657/64. Then

---------------

, we need to check if 657 and 64 are coprime.

657 divided by 3 is 219, so 657=3×219=3×3×73. 64 is 2^6. Since

---------------

 73 is a prime number, and 3 and 2 are different primes, so 657 and 64 share no common factors. Therefore, the fraction is reduced, so p=657, q=64, so p+q=657+64=721.

Wait, but before I conclude, let me double

---------------

-check all steps.

First, we set variables equal two at a time, found the case when y=2 gives a sum a=39/4.

---------------

 Then, the other solution with y≈3.898 gives a smaller a. Therefore, the maximum a is 39/4. Then

---------------

, using x²+y²+z² =a² - 2v = (39/4)^2 - 54. Let

---------------

 me compute that again:

39 squared: 39*39. Let me compute 40²=1600, subtract 79: 1600 - 79=1521. So (

---------------

39/4)^2=1521/16.

Then 2v=2*27=54, so x²+y²+z² = a

---------------

² - 54 = 1521/16 - 54. Converting 54 to 16ths: 54*

---------------

16=864, so 1521-864=657. So indeed 657/16. Thus, r squared is 657/64, which reduces to 657/64.

---------------

 Since 657 factors into 3*3*73, and 64 is 2^6, they

---------------

 are coprime, so p+q=657+64=721.

Wait, but hold

---------------

 on a second. The problem says "the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B". So

---------------

 does this mean that the sphere must contain all boxes in B at the same time, or each individually? Earlier I thought it was the maximum over all

---------------

 boxes. Let me re-read the problem.

"The smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B".

---------------

 The wording suggests that there exists a sphere such that every box in B is contained within it, and we need the smallest such sphere. So

---------------

 in that case, the radius would have to be at least as big as the maximum of the individual minimal radii for each box. Which

---------------

 is exactly what I computed. Since the maximal space diagonal is the maximum over all boxes, so the radius required is half that,

---------------

 so my calculation holds.

Alternatively, if it had meant for each box individually, then the minimal sphere for each is (space diagonal)/2, and since

---------------

 we need the minimal r such that for every box, r is at least (space diagonal)/2, so r must be the maximum of those, so same

---------------

 answer.

Therefore, my conclusion is that the answer is 657 +64=721.

Wait, but just

---------------

 to confirm, let me check if there could be a case where x, y, z are not two equal and give a larger sum. Suppose I

---------------

 have three variables not equal but giving a larger a?

Suppose we take x= something else. Let me try with x

---------------

=5, then perhaps?

Wait, let me see, perhaps an example. Let me pick x=1, then we

---------------

 have:

xyz=23 ⇒ y z=23,

and surface area: xy + yz +zx=27 ⇒ y + z + (23)/1=27 ⇒ y + z=4,

So

---------------

 y + z=4, y z=23.

But solving y and z:

The quadratic equation t² -4t +23=0.

---------------

 The discriminant is 16 -92= -76 <0. So no real solutions. So that's impossible.

Another

---------------

 example: x=3,

then y z=23/3≈7.666,

surface area: 3y +3 z + y z=27,

But

---------------

 y + z = (27 - y z)/3 = (27 -7.666)/3≈(19.333)/3≈6.444,

So

---------------

 y + z ≈6.444, y z≈7.666,

The quadratic equation would be t² -6.444 t +7.666≈0,

Discriminant: (6.444)^2 -4*7.666≈41.53 -30.664≈10.866>0,

So real roots. Then

---------------

 the sum a= x+y+z=3 +6.444≈9.444, which is less than 9.75.



---------------

So that's smaller. So the case when two variables are equal gives a larger sum. Therefore, I think 39/4 is indeed the maximum.

Therefore

---------------

, the answer is 657/64, so 657 +64 is 721.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{721}


Given a set \(\mathcal{B}\) of rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23, we need to find the radius \(r\) of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. The radius squared \(r^2\) must

 be expressed as \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime positive integers, and we need to find \(p + q\).

First, we note that for a rectangular box with dimensions \(x, y, z\), the surface area is \(2(xy + yz + zx) = 54\) and the volume is \(xyz = 23\). The radius \(r\) of the smallest sphere containing the box is half the space diagonal, so \(r = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}\). Therefore, we need to maximize \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\).

Using the identity \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx)\), we need to maximize \(x + y + z\) given the constraints \(xy + yz + zx = 27\) and \(xyz = 23\).

Assuming two variables are equal (e.g., \(y = z\)), we set up the equations:
\[
xy + y^2 + xy = 2xy + y^2 = 27 \quad \text{and} \quad xyz = x y^2 = 23
\]
Solving for \(x\) from the volume equation gives \(x = \frac{23}{y^2}\). Substituting into the surface area equation:
\[
2 \left(\frac{23}{y^2}\right) y + y^2 = \frac{46}{y} + y^2 = 27
\]
Multiplying through by \(y\) and solving the cubic equation \(y^3 - 27y + 46 = 0\), we find \(y = 2\) is a root. This gives \(x = \frac{23}{4}\), \(

y = 2\), and \(z = 2\). The sum \(x + y + z = \frac{23}{4} + 2 + 2 = \frac{39}{4}\).

The

 maximum \(x + y + z\) is \(\frac{39}{4}\), leading to:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = \left(\frac{39}{4}\right)^2 - 2 \cdot 27 = \frac{1521}{16} - \frac{864}{16} = \frac{657}{16}
\]
Thus, \(r^2 = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{657}{16} = \frac{657}{64}\). Since 657 and 64 are coprime, \(p = 657\) and \(q = 64\), giving \(p + q = 721\).

\[
\boxed{721}
