Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, let

---------------

's see. Alright, first, let me recall that for complex numbers, the modulus |z| is 4, so z is on a circle with radius 4 in the complex plane. 

The expression given is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. The real part of this expression is what we need to maximize. Since we

---------------

're dealing with complex numbers and their real parts, maybe I can write z in terms of its polar form to make things easier. 

Let me denote

---------------

 z as 4e^{iθ}, since its modulus is 4. Then 1/z would be (1/(4e^{iθ})) = (1/4)e^{-iθ}. That

---------------

 might help simplify the expression. Let's try substituting that in.

First, let's compute (75 + 117i)z. Substituting z = 4e^{iθ}, that becomes (75 + 117i)*4e^{iθ} = 4*(75 + 117i)e^{iθ}. Similarly, the second term is (96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i)/(4e^{iθ}) = (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

So the entire expression becomes 4*(75 + 117i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}. Now, to

---------------

 find the real part of this expression, I can separate the real and imaginary parts of each term.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to write each

---------------

 term in terms of cosine and sine. Let me think. Since e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ. Let

---------------

 me expand each term:

First term: 4*(75 + 117i)(cosθ + i sinθ)
Second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)

Let me compute each term separately.

Starting with the first term: 4*(75 + 117i)(cosθ + i sinθ). Let's distribute the multiplication:

First, multiply (75 + 117i) by (cosθ + i sinθ):

= 75*cosθ + 75i sinθ + 117i cosθ + 117i^2 sinθ

Since

---------------

 i^2 = -1, so the last term becomes -117 sinθ.

So combining terms:

Real parts: 75 cosθ - 117 sinθ

Imaginary parts: 75 sinθ + 117 cosθ

Multiply all of this by 4:

First term overall

---------------

:

Real part: 4*(75 cosθ - 117 sinθ)

Imaginary part: 4*(75 sinθ + 117 cosθ)

Second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ). Let's expand

---------------

 this similarly:

24*cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ

Again, i^2 = -1, so the last term becomes +36 sinθ.

So

---------------

 combining terms:

Real parts: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ

Imaginary parts: -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ

So the second term's real part is 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ, and imaginary part is (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ).

Now, adding

---------------

 the two terms together, the entire expression's real part will be the sum of the real parts of the first and second terms, and similarly for the imaginary parts. Since we only

---------------

 care about the real part, let's compute that:

Total real part = [4*(75 cosθ - 117 sinθ)] + [24 cosθ + 36 sinθ]

Let me compute each

---------------

 part step by step.

First, compute 4*(75 cosθ - 117 sinθ):

4*75 cosθ = 300 cosθ

4*(-117 sinθ) = -468 sinθ

Then,

---------------

 adding the second term's real part:

24 cosθ + 36 sinθ

So altogether:

Total real part = (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ)

Combine like terms:

cosθ terms: 300 + 24 = 324 cosθ

sinθ terms: -468 + 36 = -432 sinθ

So the real part simplifies to 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Therefore

---------------

, the real part of the entire expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Our goal is to maximize this expression with respect to θ.

Hmm, so the

---------------

 problem reduces to finding the maximum value of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. This is a standard trigonometric optimization problem. The maximum of A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A² + B²). Wait, but here the coefficients

---------------

 are 324 and -432. Let me confirm:

Wait, the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So in

---------------

 terms of the formula, it's like A cosθ + B sinθ where A = 324 and B = -432. The maximum value of such an expression is sqrt(A² + B²). Let

---------------

 me compute that.

First, compute A squared plus B squared:

324² + (-432)^2.



---------------

Let me compute 324 squared. 324 is 18^2 * 3, since 18^2 is 324. Wait no, 18^2 is 324. Wait, actually 324 is 18², so

---------------

 324 squared is (18²)^2 = 18^4. Hmm, but maybe better to compute directly.

Alternatively, 

---------------

324^2 = (300 + 24)^2 = 300² + 2*300*24 + 24² = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000+14400 is 104400, plus 576 is 104,976.

Similarly, 432 squared is (400 + 32)^2 = 400² + 2*400*32 + 32² = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 160,000 +25,600 is 185,600, plus 1,024 is 186,624.

Therefore

---------------

, A² + B² = 104,976 + 186,624 = let's compute that.

---------------

 104,976 + 186,624. Let's add 100,000 + 180,000 = 280,000. Then 4,976 + 6,624 = 11,600. So total is 280,000 +11,600 = 291,600. 



---------------

Therefore sqrt(291,600). Let me see, sqrt(291600). Since

---------------

 540 squared is 291,600 because 500² is 250,000 and 540² = (500 +40)^2 = 500² + 2*500*40 + 40² = 250,000 +40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. So sqrt(291,600) is 540.

Therefore, the maximum value of 324 cosθ -432 sinθ is 540. Wait

---------------

, but hold on. Let me confirm the formula again. The maximum of A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A² + B²). But

---------------

 in our case, the expression is A cosθ + B sinθ where A = 324 and B = -432. So yes

---------------

, the maximum is sqrt(324² + (-432)^2) = sqrt(291600) = 540. 

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540. But

---------------

 wait, is that correct? Let me check my steps again because sometimes when coefficients are negative, the angle might be different, but the maximum value

---------------

 is still the same. Since the formula holds regardless of the signs. So yes, the maximum should indeed be 540. 

But let me verify

---------------

 with an example. Suppose we set θ such that the expression reaches its maximum. Let me see, the maximum occurs when the angle θ is such that cosθ = A / sqrt(A² + B²), sinθ = B / sqrt(A² + B²). Wait, actually, in

---------------

 the standard formula, the maximum of A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A² + B²), achieved when θ is equal to the angle of the vector (A,B). But

---------------

 in this case, our expression is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, which can be considered as A cosθ + B sinθ where B is negative. So

---------------

 the angle would be such that cosφ = A / sqrt(A² + B²) and sinφ = B / sqrt(A² + B²). Since

---------------

 B is negative, the angle φ would be in a different quadrant. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the expression as R cos(θ - φ), where R is the amplitude. Let me see

---------------

. Let me confirm the formula again. 

Yes, the maximum value of a*cosθ + b*sinθ is sqrt(a² + b²). So in

---------------

 our case, even with the negative coefficient for sinθ, the maximum is still sqrt(324² + (-432)^2) = 540. 

Therefore, the answer should be 540. Wait

---------------

, but let me check if I made a mistake in the earlier steps when combining terms. Let me go back through the calculations

---------------

.

Original expression real part: 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So yes, that comes

---------------

 from:

First term real part: 4*(75 cosθ - 117 sinθ) = 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Second term real part: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ. 

Adding together

---------------

: 300 +24 = 324 cosθ, and -468 +36 = -432 sinθ. So

---------------

 that's correct.

Therefore, the real part is indeed 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. So

---------------

 the maximum is sqrt(324² + 432²). Wait, but hold on, in the formula, it

---------------

's sqrt(A² + B²), where A is the coefficient of cosθ and B is the coefficient of sinθ. Here

---------------

, A = 324, B = -432, so B squared is same as 432 squared. So sqrt

---------------

( (324)^2 + (432)^2 ) = sqrt( 104,976 + 186,624 ) = sqrt(291,600) = 540. So

---------------

 that's correct.

Therefore, the maximum possible real part is 540. Hmm, but let me think again if

---------------

 there's any step I might have messed up, especially in expanding the terms. Let me recheck the expansion of (75 + 117i)z and (96 +144i)/z.



---------------

Starting with z = 4e^{iθ}, so (75 +117i)z is (75+117i)*4e^{iθ}. Then

---------------

 when expanding (75 +117i)(cosθ + i sinθ):

75 cosθ +75 i sinθ + 117i cosθ + 117i² sinθ

=75 cosθ + i(75 sinθ +117 cosθ) -117 sinθ



---------------

Therefore real part is 75 cosθ -117 sinθ, multiplied by 4 gives 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ. That's correct.

Then (96 +144i)/z = (96 +144i)/ (4e^{iθ}) = (24 +36i) e^{-iθ} = (24 +36i)(cosθ -i sinθ). 



---------------

Expanding that: 24 cosθ -24i sinθ +36i cosθ -36i² sinθ

=24 cosθ +36 sinθ +i( -24 sinθ +36 cosθ )

Therefore

---------------

 real part is 24 cosθ +36 sinθ. That's correct. 

Adding the two real parts:

300 cosθ -468 sinθ +24 cosθ +36 sinθ = 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. Correct

---------------

.

Therefore, the maximum is indeed 540. Wait, but before I get too confident, let me check if there is

---------------

 any constraint on θ? Since z is a complex number with |z|=4, θ can be any real number between 0 and 2π, so the

---------------

 maximum over θ is indeed achievable. 

Therefore, the answer should be 540. Hmm, but let me think

---------------

 again. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial substitution?

Wait, another way to approach this problem is by using calculus. Let me try that approach

---------------

 to confirm.

Suppose we need to maximize f(θ) = 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. To

---------------

 find the maximum, take derivative and set to zero.

f’(θ) = -324 sinθ -432 cosθ. Setting this equal to zero:

-324 sinθ -432 cosθ =0 → 324 sinθ +432 cosθ =0 → 

---------------

324 sinθ = -432 cosθ → tanθ = -432/324 = -4/3.3

---------------

33... Wait, 432 divided by 324. Let me compute that. 432 / 324 = 4/3 (since both divided by 108: 432 ÷ 108=4, 324 ÷108=3). So tanθ = - (432/324) = -4/3. 



---------------

Therefore, tanθ = -4/3. Let me find θ where tanθ = -4/3. 



---------------

The angle θ would be in the second or fourth quadrant. Let me compute sinθ and cosθ for that angle.

Let me consider

---------------

 θ such that tanθ = -4/3. Let me think of a reference angle α where tanα = 4/3. So then

---------------

, in the fourth quadrant, cosθ = 3/5 and sinθ = -4/5. Alternatively, in the second quadrant, cosθ = -3/5 and sinθ =4/5.

Wait

---------------

, but let me see which one gives the maximum. Let me plug into f(θ):

f(θ) = 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

Sup

---------------

pose θ is in the fourth quadrant: cosθ = 3/5, sinθ = -4/5.

Then f(θ) = 324*(3/5) -432*(-4/5) = (972/5) + (1728/5) = (972 +1728)/5 = 2700/5 = 540.

Alternatively, in the second quadrant: cosθ = -3/5, sinθ =4/5.

Then f(θ) = 324*(-3/5) -432*(4/5) = (-972/5) - (1728/5) = (-2700)/5 = -540. So that's the minimum. 

Therefore, the maximum is indeed 540.

---------------

 So that confirms the previous result. 

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540. 

Wait, but before

---------------

 I conclude, let me check if there is another approach, perhaps using vectors or complex numbers differently? For instance, treating the expression as a complex function and finding

---------------

 its maximum real part. Alternatively, maybe using Lagrange multipliers? 

Alternatively, consider that for complex numbers with |z|=4, we can write z = 4e^{iθ}, so 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}. Let

---------------

 me denote w = z, so that 1/z = \overline{w}/|w|², but since |w|=4, then

---------------

 1/z = \overline{w}/16. Hmm, maybe not helpful. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can set

---------------

 variables as real and imaginary parts. Let me try that. Let me let z = x + yi, with x and y real numbers such that x² + y² = 16 (since |z|=4). 

Then,

---------------

 compute the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z. Let me compute each term:

First term: (75 +117i)(x + yi) = 75x +75yi +117i x +117i^2 y = 75x -117y + i(75y +117x)

Second term: (96 +144i)/(x + yi). To compute this, multiply numerator and denominator by (x - yi):

(

---------------

96 +144i)(x - yi) / (x² + y²). Since x² + y² =16, denominator is 16.

So numerator: 96x -96yi +144i x -144i² y = 96x +144y + i(144x -96y). Therefore

---------------

, the second term is [96x +144y + i(144x -96y)] /16.

Therefore, the entire expression is:

First term real

---------------

 part: 75x -117y

First term imaginary part:75y +117x

Second term real part: (96x +144y)/16 = (96x +144y)/16 = (6x +9y)/1 (divided numerator and denominator by 16/16:

---------------

 96/16=6, 144/16=9)

Second term imaginary part: (144x -96y)/16 = (9x -6y)/1 (divided numerator and denominator by 16: 144/16=9, 96/16=6)

Therefore, the

---------------

 total real part is:

(75x -117y) + (6x +9y) = 75x +6x -117y +9y =81x -108y

Wait

---------------

 a minute, this contradicts my previous result where I had 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. Hmm

---------------

, so here, using real and imaginary parts, I get the real part as 81x -108y. Wait

---------------

, so which is correct?

Hmm, that's a problem. There must be a mistake here because the two methods should give the same result. Let me check again

---------------

.

Wait, in the second approach, when I computed the first term's real part as 75x -117y. Let

---------------

's confirm:

First term is (75 +117i)(x + yi). Multiplying out:

75*x + 75*yi + 117i*x +117i*yi

=75x + (75y)i + 117x i + 117y i²

=75x -117y (since i²=-1) + i*(75y +117x). So

---------------

 the real part is indeed 75x -117y. 

Second term: (96+144i)/(x + yi). Multiply

---------------

 numerator and denominator by (x - yi):

Numerator: (96 +144i)(x - yi) =96x -96yi +144i x -144i² y

=96x +144y (since -i² y = + y) + i*( -96y +144x )

Therefore

---------------

, numerator real part is 96x +144y, imaginary part is (144x -96y). Then

---------------

 dividing by 16 gives real part (96x +144y)/16 =6x +9y, and

---------------

 imaginary part (144x -96y)/16=9x -6y. So the real part of the second term is indeed 6x +9y. 

Therefore, the total real part is (75x -117y) + (6x +9y) =81x -108y. Wait

---------------

, that's different from the previous result of 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. 

Hmm, so now

---------------

 I have a discrepancy. Which one is correct? Let's see. 

Wait, in the first approach, I used polar coordinates with

---------------

 z =4e^{iθ}, so x =4 cosθ, y =4 sinθ. Let me substitute x

---------------

 =4 cosθ, y=4 sinθ into the expression 81x -108y. Then we

---------------

 get 81*(4 cosθ) -108*(4 sinθ)= 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, which matches the first approach. So

---------------

 that is consistent. So the real part is indeed 81x -108y, which in polar coordinates becomes 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. So the

---------------

 two approaches are consistent. 

Therefore, the real part is 81x -108y, which we can write as 81x -108y. Since

---------------

 x² + y² =16, we need to maximize 81x -108y under the constraint x² + y² =16. 

Alternatively, this

---------------

 is a linear function over the circle x² + y²=16, so the maximum is the norm of the vector (81, -108) multiplied by the radius of

---------------

 the circle. Wait, yes, the maximum of ax + by on the circle x² + y² = r² is sqrt(a² + b²)*r. Let

---------------

 me verify:

The maximum of ax + by with x² + y² = r² is indeed sqrt(a² + b²)*r. 



---------------

So here, a=81, b=-108, and r=4. Wait, but the radius here is 4, but the

---------------

 circle equation is x² + y² =16 (since |z|=4). So yes, r²=16, so r=4. 

Therefore, the maximum value

---------------

 would be sqrt(81² + (-108)^2)*4. Let me compute that. 

First compute 81 squared: 81² = 6561. 108 squared: 108² = 11664. 



---------------

So sqrt(6561 + 11664) = sqrt(18225). Hmm

---------------

, sqrt(18225). Let me see, 135 squared is 18225 because

---------------

 100²=10,000, 130²=16,900, 135²= (130+5)^2 =130² + 2*130*5 +5² =16,900 +1,300 +25=18,225. So sqrt(18225)=135. 

Therefore, the maximum is 135 *4 = 540. Which

---------------

 matches the previous result. 

Therefore, regardless of the method, the maximum real part is 540. 

Therefore

---------------

, I can be confident that the answer is 540. 

Wait, but let me just think again, perhaps

---------------

 there's a step where I miscalculated the coefficients. Let me check the second approach again. 

In the first approach, when

---------------

 I used polar coordinates, the real part became 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. Then when I

---------------

 converted to rectangular coordinates, I had 81x -108y, and substituting x=4 cosθ and y=4 sinθ gives exactly 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, so that's consistent. 

Alternatively

---------------

, using Lagrange multipliers on the rectangular coordinates:

Maximize f(x,y)=81x -108y subject to g(x,y)=x² + y² -16=0.

Set up the Lagrangian: L =81x -108y -λ(x² + y² -16).

Taking partial derivatives:

dL/dx =81 - 2λx =0 → 81=2λx

dL/dy = -108 -2λy =0 → -108=2λy

dL/dλ= -(x² + y² -16)=0.

From first equation: λ=81/(2x)

From second equation: λ= -108/(2y)= -54/y

Therefore, 81/(2x) = -54/y → cross multiply: 81 y = -54*2x → 81y = -108x → divide both sides by 27: 3y = -4x → y = (-4/3)x

Now

---------------

, substitute into the constraint equation x² + y² =16.

x² + ( (16/9)x² ) =16 → x² (1 +16/9)=16 → x²*(25/9)=16 → x²= (16)*(9/25)= (144)/25 → x= ±12/5.

Thus, x=12/5 or x=-12/5.

If

---------------

 x=12/5, then y= (-4/3)*(12/5)= -16/5.

If x= -12/5, then y= (-4/3)*(-12/5)= 16/5.

Now, compute f(x,y)=81x -108y for both points.

First, for

---------------

 x=12/5, y= -16/5:

81*(12/5) -108*(-16/5)= (972/5) + (1728/5)= (972 +1728)/5= 2700/5=540.

Second point: x=-12/5, y=16/5:

81*(-12/5) -108*(16/5)= (-972/5) - (1728/5)= (-2700)/5= -540.

Therefore, the maximum is indeed 540, and

---------------

 the minimum is -540. So that's consistent with all methods. 

Therefore, the answer must be 540. 

I

---------------

 think I've checked this in multiple ways: polar coordinates, rectangular coordinates with substitution, Lagrange multipliers, and even calculus

---------------

 with derivatives. All lead to the same conclusion. Therefore, I can be confident the largest possible real part is 540.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{540}


To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in polar form. Let \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\), so \(\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\).

Substituting \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) into the expression, we get:
\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}
\]
Simplifying each term:
\[
4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} \quad \text{and} \quad (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Expanding these terms using Euler's formula \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\), we compute the real parts:
- For the first term \(4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta}\):
  \[
  4[(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + i(75\sin\theta + 117\cos\theta)]
  \]
  The real part is \(4(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta)\).

- For the second term \((24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}\):
  \[
  (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)
  \]
  The real part is \(24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta\).

Adding the real parts of both terms:
\[
4(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta)
\]
Simplifying:
\[
300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta
\]

To maximize \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\), we use the formula for the maximum value of \(A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta\), which is \(\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\):
\[
\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2}
\]
Calculating the values:
\[
324^2 = 104976 \quad \text{and} \quad 432^2 = 186624
\]
\[
\sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540
\]

Thus, the largest possible real part of the given expression is \(\boxed{540}\).<|im_end|>
