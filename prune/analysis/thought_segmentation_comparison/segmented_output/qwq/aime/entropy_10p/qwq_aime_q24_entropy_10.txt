Okay, let's see. I have to solve this problem about the residents of Aimeville and the things they own. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Hmm, this

---------------

 sounds like a problem involving the principle of inclusion-exclusion for four sets. Let me recall how that works.

First, let me list out the given information:

- Total residents: 900.
- Number who own a diamond ring (let's call this D): 195.
- Number who own golf clubs (G): 367.
- Number who own a garden spade (S): 562.
- Everyone owns candy hearts (C), so that's 900 people.

Additionally, it says there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 who own exactly three of these things. We need to find how many own all four.

Wait a second, since everyone owns candy hearts, that might simplify things. Because the candy hearts are owned by everyone, so any

---------------

 intersection involving candy hearts is just the same as the intersection of the other items. For example, the number of people who own both a diamond ring and candy hearts is just the number of people who own a diamond ring, since everyone has candy hearts. Similarly

---------------

, the intersections with three items would be the same as the intersections of the other three items, and so on. Hmm, that

---------------

 might be important.

Let me think. The inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets is a bit complicated, but since one of the sets (C) is the entire population, maybe some

---------------

 terms will drop out. Let me recall the formula for four sets:

The total number of elements in the union of four sets A, B, C, D is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |A ∩ D| - |B ∩ C| - |B ∩ D| - |C ∩ D| + |A ∩ B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ D| + |A ∩ C ∩ D| + |B ∩ C ∩ D| - |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|.

But in our case, one of the sets is C (candy hearts), which is the entire population. So,

---------------

 the union of all four sets would just be everyone, since everyone has C. Therefore, |A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = 900. 



---------------

Wait, but actually, since C is the set of all 900 residents (because everyone owns candy hearts), the union of all four sets is indeed 

---------------

900. Therefore, substituting into the inclusion-exclusion formula:

900 = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - [sum of all pairwise intersections] + [sum of all triple intersections] - [the four-way intersection].

But since |C| = 900, let

---------------

's substitute the known values:

900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - [sum of all pairwise intersections] + [sum of all triple intersections] - [the four-way intersection].

Wait, hold on. Let me make

---------------

 sure I get this right. The formula is:

Total = sum of individual sets - sum of all pairwise intersections + sum of all triple intersections - sum of four-way intersections.

But in this case, since one of the sets is the entire population, some terms might simplify. Let me see

---------------

:

First, the individual sets are D (195), G (367), S (562), and C (900). So

---------------

 adding those gives 195 + 367 + 562 + 900. Let me compute that:

195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124; 1124 + 900 = 2024. So that's the first part.

Then we subtract the sum of all pairwise intersections. Let me denote

---------------

 the pairwise intersections:

- D ∩ G, D ∩ S, D ∩ C,

- G ∩ S, G ∩ C,

- S ∩ C.

Wait, but since C is everyone, the intersections D

---------------

 ∩ C is just D, G ∩ C is G, S ∩ C is S, and C ∩ C is C,

---------------

 but since we are considering pairs, the intersections with C and another set are just the other set. Wait, but actually, the

---------------

 pairwise intersections:

Wait, D ∩ C is all who own both D and C, but since everyone owns C, that's just the number who own D, which is 195. Similarly, G ∩ C is 367, S ∩ C is 562. So

---------------

 the pairwise intersections involving C are just the individual set sizes. The other pairwise intersections (D ∩ G, D ∩ S, G ∩ S) are the usual

---------------

 intersections between those two sets.

Therefore, the sum of all pairwise intersections is:

(D ∩ G) + (D ∩ S) + (G ∩ S) + (D ∩ C) + (G ∩ C) + (S ∩ C)

= (D ∩ G) + (D ∩ S) + (G ∩ S) + D + G + S

So

---------------

 substituting the known values for D, G, S:

That becomes (D ∩ G) + (D ∩ S) + (G ∩ S) + 195 + 367 + 562.

Therefore

---------------

, the sum of all pairwise intersections is (sum of non-C intersections) plus (sum of D, G, S).

Hmm

---------------

, okay. Let me note that down.

Next, the sum of all triple intersections. The triple intersections are:

D ∩ G ∩ S,

D ∩ G ∩ C,

D ∩ S ∩ C,

G ∩ S ∩ C,

and D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C?

---------------

 Wait no, triple intersections are three-way, so:

The triples are D∩G∩S,

D∩G∩C,

D∩S∩C,

G∩S∩C,

and also D∩G∩C∩S? Wait no, triple

---------------

 intersections are three at a time. So actually, the triples are all combinations of three sets from the four. Since C is the

---------------

 universal set, some of these triples will include C, so for example D∩G∩C is just D∩G, because everyone in D and G is already in C. Similarly, D∩S∩C is just D∩S, G∩S∩C is G∩S, and D∩G∩S∩C would be the four-way intersection, but since we are considering

---------------

 triples, that's not part of the triple intersections. Wait, actually, the triple intersections not involving C would be D∩G∩S. The others

---------------

 would be triples that include C, but since C is everyone, those are equivalent to the two-set intersections.

Wait, let

---------------

 me clarify:

Triple intersections:

1. D ∩ G ∩ S

2. D ∩ G ∩ C = D ∩ G (since C is everyone)

3. D ∩ S ∩ C = D ∩ S

4. G ∩ S ∩ C = G ∩ S

5. D ∩ C ∩ G ∩ S? No, that's the four-way.

Wait, actually

---------------

, for triples, each is three sets. Since one of the sets must be C or not. Since C is the entire

---------------

 set, triples that include C are equivalent to the intersections of the other two sets. So the triple intersections are:

- D ∩ G ∩ S (the

---------------

 intersection of all three non-C items),

- D ∩ G ∩ C = D ∩ G,

- D ∩ S ∩ C = D ∩ S,

- G ∩ S ∩ C = G ∩ S,

- and

---------------

 D ∩ G ∩ C is the same as D ∩ G, etc. So actually, the triple intersections that

---------------

 include C are just the pairwise intersections of the other two. 

Therefore, the sum of all triple intersections is:

(D ∩ G ∩ S) + (D ∩ G) + (D ∩ S) + (G ∩ S).

Wait

---------------

, but the problem states that there are 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Hmm, maybe I need to approach

---------------

 this differently because the problem gives the number of people with exactly two or exactly three, which might relate to the inclusion-exclusion counts. Let

---------------

 me think again.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to approach this problem by considering the standard inclusion-exclusion formula and then using

---------------

 the given information about exactly two and exactly three.

Wait, let me recall that the inclusion-exclusion formula counts the union, but here since

---------------

 the union is the entire population (because everyone has at least the candy hearts), so the formula must equal 900. Let

---------------

's see:

The formula is:

Total = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - sum of all pairwise intersections + sum of all triple intersections - 

---------------

4-way intersection.

But substituting the known values:

Total = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - [sum pairwise intersections] + [sum triple intersections] - [four-way].

But since

---------------

 the total is 900, so:

900 = (195 + 367 + 562 + 900) - [sum pairwise] + [sum triple] - [four-way]

Let

---------------

 me compute 195+367+562+900 first. Let's see:

195 + 367 = 562;

---------------

 562 + 562 = 1124; 1124 + 900 = 2024. So:



---------------

900 = 2024 - [sum pairwise] + [sum triple] - [four-way]

So

---------------

 rearranged:

[sum pairwise] - [sum triple] + [four-way] = 2024 - 900 = 1124.

Hmm, so

---------------

 we have that equation: sum pairwise - sum triple + four-way = 1124. Not sure yet.

But maybe

---------------

 we can also use the information about the number of people who own exactly two or exactly three items. Let me recall that the number of people in exactly two sets is equal to the sum over all pairwise intersections minus 3 times the triple intersections plus 4 times the four-way intersections? Wait, no

---------------

, perhaps I need to think in terms of the standard inclusion-exclusion counts.

Alternatively, the number of people who own exactly two items is equal to the sum of all pairwise intersections minus 3 times the number of people in exactly three items minus 4 times the number in all four. Wait, maybe

---------------

 it's better to think of it as:

The formula for exactly two is:

Sum_{i < j} |A_i ∩ A_j| - 3 * (number of people in exactly three) - 4 * (number in all four).

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I should recall that the number of people in exactly two sets is equal to the sum of all pairwise intersections minus 3 times the sum of triple intersections plus 3 times the four-way intersections? Hmm, getting

---------------

 confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps using the standard formula for exactly k sets:

The number of elements in exactly m sets is given by:

E_m = S_m - C(m+1,1) * E_{m+1} + C(m+2,2)*E_{m+2} - ... + (-1)^{n-m} C(n, n-m) * E_n}

But maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, let

---------------

's denote variables for the different overlaps.

Let me denote:

Let a = number of people who own exactly one item.

b = number who own exactly two items = 437 (given).

c = number who own exactly three items = 234 (given).

d = number who own all four items = what we need to find.

Since everyone owns at least the candy hearts, so the

---------------

 total is a + b + c + d = 900.

We also know that the total number owning exactly two items is 437, exactly three is 234, and all four is d. The rest own only the candy hearts (

---------------

so exactly one item, which is the candy hearts). Therefore, a = 900 - (437 + 234 + d).

But we

---------------

 might need more equations. Let's see if we can express the counts of the individual items in terms of a, b, c, d.

Each

---------------

 person who owns exactly one item must own only candy hearts, so contributes 1 to |C| but 0 to D, G, S.

Each person who owns exactly two items could

---------------

 be in various pairs. Since they own two items, one of which must be candy hearts? Wait, no. Wait, since

---------------

 everyone owns candy hearts, the "exactly two items" must include candy hearts and one other, or two non-candy items plus candy hearts? Wait, hold on.

---------------

 Wait, actually, since everyone has candy hearts, the "exactly two items" would mean they have candy hearts plus one other item. Because if someone has two items, it

---------------

's candy hearts plus one more. Similarly, exactly three items would be candy hearts plus two others, and exactly four is all four.

Therefore, the

---------------

 people in exactly two items own candy hearts plus one of the other three items. So for example, the number of people who own exactly D and C (but no G or S) would be part of the "exactly two" category, and

---------------

 similarly for G and C, S and C, etc. The people who own exactly three items would be those who have candy hearts plus two others, like D and G and C but not S, etc. And those with all four are D, G, S, and C.

Therefore, let

---------------

's think in terms of variables for overlaps.

Let me define variables for the overlaps:

Let me denote:

Let’s define:

- Let x be the number of people who own exactly D and C (and none of G or S).

- Similarly, y: exactly G and C,

- z: exactly S and C,

- a

---------------

1: exactly D, G, and C (but not S),

- a2: exactly D, S, and C (but not G),

- a3: exactly G, S, and C (but not D),

- b1: exactly D, G, S, and C (all four).

Wait, but perhaps

---------------

 this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, since the "exactly two" category must be combinations of one non-C item plus C, so there are three types of

---------------

 exactly two-item owners: D & C only, G & C only, S & C only. Similarly, exactly three-item owners would be D, G, C only; D, S, C only; G, S, C only; and D

---------------

, G, S, C but that's actually four items. Wait, no, exactly three would be combinations of two non-C items plus C. So there

---------------

 are three possibilities for exactly three: D, G, C; D, S, C; G, S, C. And

---------------

 then exactly four is D, G, S, C.

Therefore, the total number of people in exactly two items is (number with D and C only) + (G and C only) + (S and C only) = 437.

Similarly, the number in exactly three items is (D,G,C only) + (D,S,C only) + (G,S,C only) = 234.

And the number in all four is b1 (which

---------------

 is D,G,S,C) = d.

Additionally, the number of people who own only C is a = 900 - (437 + 234 + d).

Now, let's express

---------------

 the counts for each item:

For D:

The total number of people who own D is the sum of those who have D and C only, plus those who have D, G, C only, plus those who have D, S, C only, plus those who have all four (D,G,S,C).

So:

|D| = x + a1 + a2 + d = 195.

Similarly for |G|:

|G| = y + a1 + a3 + d = 367.

And |S|:

|S| = z + a2 + a3 + d = 562.

Also, the number of people who own exactly two items is x + y + z = 437.

The number who own exactly three items is a1 + a2 + a3 = 234.

So we have the

---------------

 following equations:

1. x + y + z = 437 (exactly two)

2. a1 + a2 + a3 = 234 (exactly three)

3. x + a1 + a2 + d = 195 (D's total)

4. y + a1 + a3 + d = 367 (G's total)

5. z + a2 + a3 + d = 562 (S's total)

We need to find d.

Let

---------------

 me write down these equations again:

Equation 3: x = 195 - (a1 + a2 + d)

Equation 4: y = 367 - (a1 + a3 + d)

Equation 5: z = 562 - (a2 + a3 + d)

Sub

---------------

stituting x, y, z into equation 1:

[195 - (a1 + a2 + d)] + [367 - (a1 + a3 + d)] + [562 - (a2 + a3 + d)] = 437

Let me compute each term:

First term: 195 - a1 - a2 - d

Second term: 367 - a1 - a3 - d

Third term: 562 - a2 - a3 - d

Adding them together:

195 + 367 + 562 - (a1 + a2 + d + a1 + a3 + d + a2 + a3 + d) = 437

Compute

---------------

 the constants first: 195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124. Wait, 195 + 367 is actually 562? Wait 195 + 367: 195 + 300 = 495, plus 67 is 562. Then 562 + 562 = 1124. So

---------------

 total constants: 1124.

Now the variables subtracted:

Looking at the terms in the parentheses:

a1 + a2 + d (from first term)

+ a1 + a3 + d (from second term)

+ a2 + a3 + d (from third term)

Total variables:



---------------

(a1 + a1) + (a2 + a2) + (a3 + a3) + (d + d + d) + ...

---------------

 Wait, let's count each variable:

For a1: appears in first and second terms: 2a1

For a2: first and third terms: 2a2

For a3: second and third terms: 2a3

For d: each term has a d, so three terms: 3d

Therefore total variables subtracted: 2a1 + 2a2 + 2a3 + 3d.

Therefore, the equation becomes:

1124 - [2(a1 + a2 + a3) + 3d] = 437

But from equation 2, we know that a1 + a2 + a3 = 234. Let

---------------

's substitute that:

1124 - [2*234 + 3d] = 437

Calculate 2*234 = 468,

---------------

 so:

1124 - 468 - 3d = 437

1124 - 468 is 656,

---------------

 so:

656 - 3d = 437

Subtract 437 from both sides:

656 - 437 = 3d

219 = 3d => d = 73.

Wait, so d

---------------

 = 73? Let me check my steps again to make sure.

Wait, let's verify:

Starting from the substituted equation:

1124 - [2(a1 + a2 + a3) + 3d] = 437

Given

---------------

 that a1 + a2 + a3 = 234, so:

1124 - (2*234 + 3d) = 437

2

---------------

*234 is 468, so 1124 - 468 = 656



---------------

656 - 3d = 437

So 656 - 437 = 3d

656 - 437: 656 - 400 = 256, then subtract 37 more: 256 - 37 = 219

2

---------------

19 = 3d => d = 73. Okay that seems consistent.

Therefore, the number of residents who own all four items is 73. Let me see

---------------

 if this makes sense with the other equations.

Let me check if this is correct. Let me see if the values can hold.

Let

---------------

 me compute a1 + a2 + a3 = 234.

Let me try to find x, y, z.



---------------

From equation 3: x = 195 - (a1 + a2 + d) = 195 - ( (a1 + a2 + a3) - a3 + d )

Wait, since

---------------

 a1 + a2 + a3 = 234, so a1 + a2 = 234 - a3.

Wait

---------------

, perhaps it's better to express variables in terms of d.

Wait, perhaps let me see if there are other constraints.



---------------

Alternatively, let me check if with d=73, the equations hold.

Let me proceed step by step.

We found d = 73.

We

---------------

 need to check if all variables can be non-negative, but maybe that's overkill. Alternatively, let's see if the

---------------

 total for each item works.

Let me take equations 3,4,5 again:

Equation 3: x = 195 - (a1 + a2 + d)

But a1 + a2 = (a1 + a2 + a3) - a3 = 234 - a3.

Thus, x = 195 - (234 - a3 + d) = 195 - 234 + a3 - d

Pl

---------------

ugging d =73:

x = 195 -234 + a3 -73 = (195 -234 -73) + a3 = (-112) + a3.

Hmm, so

---------------

 x = a3 - 112. Since x must be non-negative, so a3 must be at least 112.

Similarly, equation 4:

y = 367 - (a1 + a3 + d)

=

---------------

 367 - (a1 + a3 +73)

= 367 - a1 - a3 -73

= 294 - a1 - a3

Equation 5:

z =562 - (a2 + a3 + d)

=562 - a2 -a3 -73

= 489 - a2 - a3

Now

---------------

, also, equation 1: x + y + z = 437.

Substituting x = a3 -112, y =294 -a1 -a3, z =489 -a2 -a3 into

---------------

 equation 1:

(a3 -112) + (294 -a1 -a3) + (489 -a2 -a3) = 437

Simplify term by term:

First term: a3 -112

Second term: 294 -a1 -a3

Third term: 489 -a2 -a3

Adding them:

a3 -112 + 294 -a1 -a3 + 489 -a2 -a3

Combine like terms:

a3 -a3 -a3 = -a3

-112 +294 = 182; 182 +489 = 671

So total constants: 671

Variables: -a1 -a2 -a3

Thus:



---------------

671 - (a1 +a2 +a3) - a3 = 437 ?

Wait, wait

---------------

:

Wait, let me recompute:

Wait, the first term's a3 cancels with the second term's -a3, and

---------------

 the third term has another -a3. So total for a3 terms: (1 -1 -1)a3 = -a3.

The other

---------------

 variables: -a1 -a2 from the second and third terms.

Wait, actually, let's re-express:



---------------

The entire expression is:

(a3 -112) + (294 -a1 -a3) + (489 -a2 -a3)

= [a3 - a3 -a3] + [-a1 -a2] + [-112 +294 +489]

= (-a3 -a1 -a2) + ( -112 + 294 + 489 )

Compute constants: 294 + 489 = 783; 783 - 112 = 671

So total:



---------------

- (a1 + a2 + a3) - a3 + 671 ?

Wait, no, hold

---------------

 on:

Wait, the variables are:

From first term: +a3,

Second term: -a1 -a3,

Third term: -a2 -a3,

So combining

---------------

 variables:

a3 -a3 -a3 -a1 -a2 = -a1 -a2 -a3,

and

---------------

 constants: -112 +294 +489 = 671,

So total expression is:

(-a1 -a2 -a3) + 671 = 437.

Thus

---------------

,

- (a1 + a2 + a3) + 671 = 437,

But since a1 +a2 +a3 =234,

-

---------------

234 + 671 = 437,

Which is 437 = 437. So that checks out.

Therefore, the equations are consistent.

---------------

 So d=73 is a valid solution. Since all steps led us here and the check works out, I think that

---------------

's the correct answer.

Therefore, the number of residents who own all four items is 73.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{73}


Given the problem of finding the number of residents in Aimeville who own all four items (diamond ring, set of golf clubs, garden spade, and bag of candy hearts), we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and the given data:

- Total residents: 900
- Residents owning a diamond ring (D): 195
- Residents owning golf clubs (G): 367
- Residents owning a garden spade (S): 562
- All residents own candy hearts (C): 900
- Residents owning exactly two items: 437
- Residents owning exactly three items: 234

We denote:
- \(d\) as the number of residents owning all four items (the value we need to find).

Key

---------------

 steps:
1. **Equations based on inclusion-exclusion principle**:
   - The total number of residents owning exactly two items is the sum of those owning each pair of items (excluding the fourth item,

---------------

 which is candy hearts for exactly two items).
   - The total number of residents owning exactly three items is the sum of those owning each triplet of items (excluding the fourth item, which is candy hearts for exactly three items).

2. **Setting up equations**:
   - Let \(a_1\), \(a_2\), \(a_3\) be the number of residents owning exactly three items (D, G, C), (D, S, C), and (G, S, C) respectively.
   - Let \(x\), \(y\), \(z\) be the number of residents owning exactly two items (D, C), (G, C), and (S, C) respectively.

   The equations are:
   \[
   \begin{aligned}
   x + y + z &= 437, \\
   a_1 + a_2 + a_3 &= 234, \\
   x + a_1 + a_2 + d &= 195, \\
   y + a_1 + a_3 + d &= 367, \\
   z + a_2 + a_3 + d &= 562.
   \end{aligned}
   \]

3. **Substituting and solving**:
   - Substitute \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) from the third, fourth, and fifth equations into the first equation:
     \[
     \begin{aligned}
     &

---------------

 \left[195 - (a_1 + a_2 + d)\right] + \left[367 - (a_1 + a_3 + d)\right] + \left[562 - (a_2 + a_3 + d)\right] = 437, \\
     & 1124 - [2(a_1 + a_2 + a_3) + 3d] = 437.
     \end{aligned}
     \]
   - Using \(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 234\):
     \[
     1124 - (2 \cdot 234 + 3d) = 437, \\
     1124 - 468 - 3d = 437, \\
     656 - 3d = 437, \\
     3d = 219, \\
     d = 73.
     \]

Thus, the number of residents who own all four items is \(\boxed{73}\).<|im_end|>
