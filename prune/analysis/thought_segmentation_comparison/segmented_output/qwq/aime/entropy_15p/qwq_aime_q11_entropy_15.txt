Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of ways to place digits in a 2x3 grid such that two conditions are met. First, the sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by reading each row left to right should be 999. Second, the sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by reading each column top to bottom should be 99. The example given is a grid where the top row is 0,0,8 and the bottom row is 9,9,1. Let

---------------

 me see how that works: 008 + 991 = 999, and then the columns are 0+9=9, 0+9=9, and 8+1=9, so

---------------

 each column sums to 9, and adding those three gives 9+9+9=27, but wait, the problem says the sum of the three numbers formed vertically

---------------

 is 99. Wait, hold on, maybe I misread that part.

Wait, the problem says "the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99". Hmm

---------------

, so maybe each column is considered as a 2-digit number, top then bottom, and their sum is 99? Let me check the example given

---------------

. The grid is:

First row: 0,0,8

Second row:9,9,1

So the

---------------

 columns would be:

First column: 0 and 9, forming 09? Or 90? Wait, the

---------------

 problem says "reading top to bottom", so the first column is top digit first, so it's 0 followed by 9, which

---------------

 would be 09, but leading zeros are allowed here? Or is it a two-digit number where the top digit is the tens place and the bottom is the ones? Wait

---------------

, the example says the sum of the three numbers formed top to bottom is 99. Let's compute that:

First column: 0 and 9.

---------------

 If it's a two-digit number, top digit is tens place, so 0*10 + 9 = 9.

---------------

 Second column: 0 and 9: same, 09, which is 9. Third column: 8 and 1, so 8*10 +1 =81. So adding

---------------

 those three numbers: 9 +9 +81 = 99. Oh, that's right. So each column is a

---------------

 two-digit number where the top digit is the tens place and the bottom is the ones. So the first column is 09

---------------

, which is 9, second column is 09 again, 9, third is 81. So their

---------------

 sum is indeed 99. Got it.

So the problem is to arrange digits in a 2x3 grid such that:

1. The top row (three

---------------

 digits) forms a number A, the bottom row forms a number B, and A + B = 999.

2. Each column,

---------------

 read as a two-digit number (top digit is tens, bottom is ones), so for column 1: 10*a11 + a21, column 2: 10*a12 +a22, column3:10*a13 +a23. The sum of these three numbers

---------------

 is 99.

We need to count the number of such grids.

Let me denote the grid as follows:

Let the top row be digits a, b, c (

---------------

so the top number is 100a + 10b + c)

The bottom row is digits d, e, f (so the bottom number is 100d + 10e + f)

So

---------------

 the first condition is (100a +10b + c) + (100d +10e + f) = 999.

The second condition is:



---------------

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

We

---------------

 need to find the number of 6-tuples (a,b,c,d,e,f) where each is a digit from 0 to 9, with

---------------

 a and d not both zero? Wait, actually, since they are the first digits of 3-digit numbers, so a and d can be zero? Wait, the

---------------

 problem says "numbers formed by reading left to right". So, the top number is a 3-digit number, so leading

---------------

 zeros are allowed? Wait in the example, the top row starts with 0, so 008 is considered a 3-digit number,

---------------

 which is 8. So perhaps leading zeros are allowed here. So a, b, c can be 0-9, and

---------------

 similarly d, e, f can be 0-9. So the first number can be from 000 to 999, but

---------------

 when you add the two numbers, they have to sum to 999. Similarly for the vertical columns.

So let

---------------

's first write down the equations.

First equation:

(100a +10b + c) + (100d +10e + f) = 999.

Second equation:

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

Let me see

---------------

 if we can manipulate these equations to find relationships between the variables.

Let me first handle the first equation. Let's expand it:

100a +10b + c + 100d +10e + f = 999

Group

---------------

 like terms:

100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

Similarly, the second equation is:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

Which can be written as:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Hmm, so

---------------

 perhaps there's a way to relate these two equations.

Let me denote S1 = a + d, S2 = b + e, S3 = c + f.

Then the first equation becomes

---------------

 100 S1 + 10 S2 + S3 = 999.

Similarly, the second equation can

---------------

 be written as 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Let

---------------

 me note that (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = S1 + S2 + S3.

Therefore

---------------

, the second equation is 10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Let me denote

---------------

 T = a + b + c, so then d + e + f = 99 - 10*T.

But

---------------

 also, S1 + S2 + S3 = (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = T + (99 - 10*T) = 99 -9*T.

Hmm

---------------

, but maybe that's not the most helpful. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find relationships between the variables by

---------------

 looking at the first equation's digits.

Looking at the first equation: 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

This

---------------

 equation must hold as a number. So, let me consider the digits of 999. The units digit is 9, the tens digit is 9, and the hundreds digit is 9. So

---------------

, the sum (a + d)*100 + (b + e)*10 + (c + f) must equal 999. Therefore, the

---------------

 individual digits when adding the two numbers must add up such that:

The units digit (c + f) mod 10 must

---------------

 equal 9, and the carryover from the units to the tens place is floor[(c + f)/10].

Similarly, the tens digit (

---------------

b + e + carryover from units) mod 10 must equal 9, and carryover to hundreds is floor[(b + e + carryover_units)/10].

The

---------------

 hundreds digit (a + d + carryover from tens) must equal 9 (since 999 has a hundreds digit of 9),

---------------

 and there's no higher digit, so the total must not have a thousands digit, so the carryover from hundreds must be zero.

Therefore

---------------

, let me formalize this:

Let me denote the variables:

Letâ€™s define variables for the carries:

Let c0 = carry

---------------

over from units to tens: c0 = floor[(c + f)/10]

Then the units digit is (c + f) - 10*c0 = 9.

---------------

 So,

(c + f) = 9 + 10*c0. (Equation 1)

Similarly, moving

---------------

 to the tens place:

The total in the tens place before carryover is (b + e) + c0.

The digit

---------------

 here must be 9, so:

(b + e + c0) mod 10 = 9,

and the carryover to the hundreds place is c1 = floor[(b + e + c0)/10].

Thus

---------------

,

(b + e + c0) = 9 + 10*c1. (Equation 2)

Then

---------------

, moving to the hundreds place:

The total here before carryover is (a + d) + c1.

This must equal 9, because

---------------

 the hundreds digit of 999 is 9, and there is no carryover beyond that (since 999 is a

---------------

 3-digit number). Therefore,

(a + d) + c1 = 9. (Equation 3)

Additionally

---------------

, since there is no carryover beyond the hundreds place, c1 must be 0 or 1, but since (a + d) + c1 =9, and a and d are digits (0-9), their

---------------

 sum can be at most 18, so c1 could be up to floor[(b + e + c0)/10]. Hmm

---------------

, but let's see.

So, we have three equations here (Equations 1, 2, 3)

---------------

 involving c0, c1, and the variables a,b,c,d,e,f.

Additionally, the second condition is the sum

---------------

 of the vertical columns:

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

Let me compute

---------------

 this sum:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

So

---------------

 that's another equation. Let me note that.

So, we have multiple equations here. Let me see if we can combine

---------------

 them.

First, let me note that from Equation 3: a + d = 9 - c1.

Similarly, from Equation 2: b + e = 9 + 10*c1 - c0.

Wait, Equation

---------------

 2 says (b + e + c0) = 9 + 10*c1, so rearranged,

---------------

 b + e = 9 +10*c1 - c0.

From Equation 1: c + f = 9 +10*c0.

So

---------------

, we can express a + d, b + e, and c + f in terms of c0 and c1.

Let

---------------

 me also note that the total sum of all digits in rows:

The first number is 100a +10b +c, the second is 100d +10e +f, so their sum is 999.

---------------

 Alternatively, the sum of all digits (a + b + c + d + e + f) can be related to the

---------------

 digits of 999, but since there are carries involved, it's not straightforward. However, maybe we can use

---------------

 the vertical sum equation.

The vertical sum equation: 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) =99.

Let me denote:



---------------

Let me call S = a + b + c,

then d + e + f = 99 - 10*S.

Therefore

---------------

, the total sum of all digits is S + (99 -10*S) = 99 -9*S.

Hmm

---------------

, but also, from the first equation, the sum of the two numbers is 999. Let me see if

---------------

 that can be connected.

The sum of the two numbers is (100a +10b +c) + (100d +10e +f) = 999.



---------------

This is equal to 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999, which we already considered

---------------

.

Alternatively, the total digit sum (without considering carries) would be (a + d) + (b + e)*1 +

---------------

 (c + f)*1, but with carries. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps using the variables

---------------

 from Equations 1, 2, 3.

Let me see:

We have:

Equation 1: c + f = 9 +10c0.

Equation 2: b + e = 9 +10c1 - c0.

Equation 3: a + d = 9 - c1.

Additionally

---------------

, from the vertical sum equation:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Let me express

---------------

 d + e + f in terms of S:

d + e + f = 99 - 10*(a + b + c).

But

---------------

 also, note that d + e + f = (d) + (e) + (f).

Alternatively, let me try

---------------

 to express everything in terms of a, b, c, d, e, f, but perhaps substituting variables.

Alternatively, let

---------------

 me consider the variables c0 and c1 as parameters. Since c0 and c1 are carryover digits, they must be integers.

---------------

 Let me see the possible values for c0 and c1.

First, c0 is the carryover from the units to tens place, so c

---------------

0 can be 0 or 1, because c + f can be at most 9 + 9 =18, so c

---------------

0 is floor((c + f)/10). Since c + f can be from 9 (if c0=0) up to 19? Wait, but

---------------

 c and f are digits (0-9). So maximum c + f is 18, so c0 can be 0 or 1.

Similarly, c1 is the carryover from the tens to hundreds place. The tens

---------------

 place calculation is (b + e + c0). The maximum possible value here is (9 +9 +1)=19, so c1 can be 0 or 1.



---------------

Wait, but let me confirm:

In the tens place: (b + e + c0). Since b and e are digits (0-9), c

---------------

0 is 0 or 1. So the maximum possible is 9 +9 +1 =19, so floor

---------------

(19/10)=1. So c1 can be 0 or 1.

Similarly, the hundreds place:

---------------

 (a + d) + c1 must equal 9. Since a and d are digits (0-9), their sum can be from

---------------

 0 to 18. Adding c1 (0 or 1), so total can be from 0+0=0 to 18+1=19. But the

---------------

 equation says (a + d) + c1 =9, so possible?

Wait, but (a + d) + c1 =9, so since

---------------

 a + d can be up to 9 + c1? Wait, but c1 is 0 or 1. Let

---------------

's see.

Let me consider possible c0 and c1 values.

Case 1: c0 =0, c1 =0.

Then:



---------------

From Equation 3: a + d =9.

From Equation 2: b + e =9 +10*0 -0 =9.

From Equation 1: c + f =9 +0=9.

Then

---------------

 the vertical sum equation:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) =99.

Let

---------------

 me compute d + e + f: since d =9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c.



---------------

Wait, since a + d =9 => d =9 -a,

Similarly, e =9 - b,

f =9 -c.

Therefore, d + e + f = (9 -a) + (9 -b) + (9 -c) =27 - (a +b +c).

Therefore

---------------

, substituting into vertical sum equation:

10*(a + b + c) + (27 - (a + b + c)) =99.

S

---------------

implify:

10S +27 - S =99, where S =a +b +c.

So 9S +27=99 =>

---------------

 9S =72 => S=8.

Therefore, a + b +c=8.

But also, since

---------------

 d =9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c,

the digits d, e, f are determined by a, b, c.

But

---------------

 we also need to ensure that all digits are between 0 and 9.

So for each digit a, b, c,

---------------

 we have d=9 -a must be between 0 and 9, so a can be from 0 to9, but 

---------------

9 -a must also be between 0 and9. Since a is a digit (0-9), d is automatically

---------------

 between 0 and9. Similarly for e and f.

So the constraints here are:

a, b, c are digits (0-9),



---------------

a + b + c =8,

and d=9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c must

---------------

 also be digits (0-9), which they are as long as a, b, c are between 0 and9.



---------------

Therefore, in this case (c0=0, c1=0), the number of solutions is equal to the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =8, where each of a, b, c is between 0 and9.

But

---------------

 since 8 is less than 3*9, the only constraints are that each variable is at least 0 and at most 9, but since the

---------------

 sum is 8, each variable can be at most 8, so the standard stars and bars applies.

The number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =8 is C(8 +3 -1, 3 -1)= C(10,2)=45.

However

---------------

, we need to ensure that each of a, b, c is a digit (so up to 9, which is already satisfied here

---------------

 since 8 is the total sum). So 45 solutions here.

But wait, but in this case, the vertical

---------------

 numbers would be:

First column: 10a + d =10a + (9 -a) =9a +9 =

---------------

9(a +1).

Similarly, second column:10b + e=10b + (9 -b)=9b +9=9(b+1).

Third column:10c +f=10c + (9 -c)=9c +9=9(c +1).

Therefore

---------------

, each column is a multiple of 9, and their sum is 9(a+1 + b+1 +c+1)=9(a + b +c +3)=9*(8 +3)=9*11=99, which matches the required vertical

---------------

 sum. So that's consistent.

Therefore, in this case, all solutions are valid as long as a + b + c =8, and digits

---------------

 a, b, c are 0-9. So 45 solutions.

Case 2: c0=0, c1=1.

Wait

---------------

, let's check if this is possible.

If c0=0, then c + f =9 +10*0=9.



---------------

Then Equation 2: b + e =9 +10*c1 -c0=9 +10*1 -0=19.

But b and e are digits (each 0-9), so their sum can be at most 18. So

---------------

 19 is impossible. Therefore, c1 cannot be 1 when c0=0. So this case is invalid.

Case 3: c0=1, c1=0.

Then

---------------

:

From Equation 1: c + f =9 +10*1=19.

But c and f are digits (0-9 each), so their maximum sum is 18. 

---------------

19 is impossible. So this case is invalid.

Case 4: c0=1, c1=1.

Now

---------------

 let's see:

Equation 1: c + f =9 +10*1=19. Still impossible,

---------------

 since c and f can only add up to 18 maximum. So this case is also invalid.

Wait, so only

---------------

 the first case (c0=0, c1=0) is possible? Wait, that can't be. Because

---------------

 in the example given, the vertical columns are 09,09,81. Let me check what the c

---------------

0 and c1 would be in that example.

In the example:

Top row:0,0,8; bottom row:9,9,1.

So c

---------------

 is 8, f is1. c + f=9. So c0= floor(9/10)=0.

Then

---------------

, moving to the tens place:

b + e =0 +9=9. Adding c0=0: 9 +

---------------

0=9, so the tens digit is 9, so c1= floor(9/10)=0. So c

---------------

1=0.

Therefore, this is indeed the first case.

So the only possible case is c0=0 and c1=0. Therefore

---------------

, all solutions must satisfy a +d =9, b +e=9, c +f=9, and a +b +c=8,

---------------

 so d +e +f=27 - (a +b +c)=27-8=19,

---------------

 but then 10*(a+b+c) + (d + e + f)=10*8 +19=80+19=99, which works

---------------

.

Therefore, the only possible case is c0=0 and c1=0, leading to a +d =9, b +e=9, c +f=9, and a +b +c=8.

Therefore

---------------

, the total number of solutions is the number of triples (a,b,c) where a, b, c are digits (0-9) with a + b + c =8, and then d=9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c are

---------------

 also digits (which they will be since a, b, c are between 0 and9, so 9 -a

---------------

 etc. are between 0 and9).

Therefore, the number of triples (a,b,c) is the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =8, with each variable between 0 and8 (since their

---------------

 sum is 8, so each variable can't exceed 8). The number is C(8 +3 -1, 3-1)=C(10,2)=45.

---------------

 So that's 45 solutions.

Wait, but hold on. Wait, in the problem statement, the example given has a=0, b=0, c=8, which is

---------------

 one such solution. But is there any restriction on leading zeros? The problem says "the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999". The numbers

---------------

 can have leading zeros, as the example includes 008. So a and d can be zero. So all 

---------------

45 solutions are valid?

Wait, but let me think again. Each of a, b, c, d, e, f must be digits (0-9), but

---------------

 there's no restriction on being non-zero except that they are digits. So yes, leading zeros are allowed, so all 

---------------

45 are valid.

Wait, but hold on a second. Wait, in the vertical columns, each column's two-digit number is

---------------

 10a +d, etc. So for the first column, if a is 0 and d is 9, that gives

---------------

 09, which is 9. That's acceptable. So all the vertical numbers can be from 00 to99, but

---------------

 their sum has to be 99. So all the constraints are satisfied as per the equations.

Therefore, the total number of grids

---------------

 is 45?

But hold on, wait, let me check if there are other cases where c0 or c1 can be non

---------------

-zero but still possible.

Earlier I considered c0 can be 0 or 1, but when c0=1, c

---------------

 + f must be 19, which is impossible. So only c0=0 is possible. Similarly, c1 can be 0 or 1, but when

---------------

 c0=0, c1 can only be 0 because otherwise, b + e would have to be 19,

---------------

 which is impossible. So indeed, only one case is possible, leading to 45 solutions. So is the answer 45? But wait

---------------

, let me think again.

Wait, in the example given, the digits are a=0, b=0, c=8; d=9, e=9, f=1. So

---------------

 that's one of the 45 solutions. But let me see if there's another constraint that I missed.

Wait, the

---------------

 problem states "the number of ways to place a digit in each cell". Each cell is a digit, so each of a,b,c,d,e,f can

---------------

 be 0-9, but with the constraints from the equations.

Wait, but in the equations above, we considered that

---------------

 a + b + c =8. So each triplet (a,b,c) must sum to 8, and then d,e,f are determined as 9 - a, etc. However

---------------

, in this scenario, each of d,e,f is uniquely determined by a,b,c. So each solution (a,b,c) gives exactly one grid. Therefore

---------------

, the total number is indeed the number of triples (a,b,c) with a + b + c =8, with

---------------

 a,b,c digits (0-9). Since their sum is 8, each variable can be at most 8, so all

---------------

 variables are within 0-8, hence valid digits.

Therefore, the number is C(10,2)=45. So

---------------

 is that the answer?

Wait, but let me think again. Wait, when we count the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =8, it

---------------

's indeed 45. But each of these corresponds to a unique grid. However, are there any additional constraints?

Wait, for

---------------

 example, in the vertical columns, the two-digit numbers are 10a + d, etc. Since d=9 -a, so

---------------

 10a + (9 -a)=9a +9. Similarly for others. So each column is 9*(a+1), 9*(b+1), 9*(c+1). Therefore

---------------

, each column is a multiple of 9, and their sum is 9*(a+1 + b+1 + c+1)=9*(a +b +c +3)=9*(8 +3)=99, which is

---------------

 correct.

Therefore, all these grids satisfy the vertical sum condition. Therefore, yes, 45 is the answer.

Wait, but let

---------------

 me think again. Wait, the problem says "the number of ways to place a digit in each cell". Since digits can be repeated

---------------

, except that they are determined by a,b,c. For example, a can be 0-8, but even if a is 0, d

---------------

 is 9, etc. So each triplet (a,b,c) gives exactly one grid. So 45 should be correct.

Wait, but hold

---------------

 on. Let me check with another example. Suppose a=8, b=0, c=0. Then d=1, e=9, f=9. So

---------------

 the grid would be:

Top row:8,0,0

Bottom row:1,9,9

Then the top

---------------

 number is 800, bottom is 199. Their sum is 800 + 199 = 999, which is correct. The vertical columns:

First column: 10*8 +1=81, second:10*0 +9=9, third:10*0 +9=9. Sum

---------------

:81 +9 +9=99. That works. So this is another valid grid. So that's counted

---------------

 in the 45.

Another example: a=2, b=3, c=3. Then a + b +c=8. Then d=7, e=6, f=6. The

---------------

 grid:

Top:2,3,3

Bottom:7,6,6

Top number:233, bottom:766. Sum:233+766=999. Columns: 27, 36, 36. Sum

---------------

:27+36+36=99. Correct.

So all these work. So seems okay. Therefore

---------------

, the answer is 45? Hmm.

Wait, but hold on. Let me check the problem statement again. It says "the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99". The

---------------

 example given has three numbers: 09,09,81 which add to 99. Each of these is

---------------

 a two-digit number, so the first column is 0 followed by9, so 09, which is 9. But

---------------

 in the problem statement, when it says "numbers", does it allow leading zeros? For instance, is 09 considered a valid two-digit number? The

---------------

 problem didn't specify that numbers can't have leading zeros, so yes, as the example includes it. Therefore, all the

---------------

 cases where a=0 are allowed. So the count is indeed 45.

But wait, let me check another thing

---------------

. Suppose a=5, b=2, c=1, which sums to 8. Then d=4, e=7, f=8. Then

---------------

 the vertical numbers would be 10*5 +4=54, 10*2 +7=27, 10*1 +8=18. Their

---------------

 sum is 54+27+18=99. Correct. So that works.

Alternatively, if a=0, b=0, c=8,

---------------

 then vertical columns are 09,09,81. Which is exactly the example. So all these are valid.

Therefore

---------------

, the total number is 45. Hmm. But I feel like maybe I'm missing something here. Because 45 seems straightforward, but perhaps

---------------

 I need to check if there are other cases where c0 or c1 can be different?

Wait, let me think again about the equations

---------------

. Earlier, I considered that c0 can only be 0 because c + f=9 or 19, but 19 is impossible, so c0 must be 0. Then

---------------

 c1 can only be 0 because otherwise, the sum b +e would be too big. Therefore, only one case.

---------------

 So 45 is correct. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations. Let me rederive them

---------------

.

The first equation: the two numbers add to 999. Let me think of the addition:

   ABC
+  DEF
-------
  999

Where ABC is the top number, DEF the bottom. So

---------------

 when adding digit by digit:

Starting from the units digit:

C + F = 9 or 19 (since if

---------------

 there's a carryover, but since the total is 9 in the units place, so C + F =9 or 19 (

---------------

with a carryover of 1). But since the next digit (tens) must also sum to 9, let

---------------

's see:

Tens digit: B + E + carryover_from_units =9 or 19. But the total digit

---------------

 is 9, so:

(B + E + carryover) mod10 =9,

and carryover to hundreds is floor[(B + E + carryover)/10].

Hundreds

---------------

 digit: A + D + carryover_from_tens =9.

And there must be no carryover beyond the hundreds digit,

---------------

 so the total carryover_from_tens must be such that A + D + carryover_from_tens =9, and there

---------------

 is no thousands digit.

Therefore, if there is a carryover_from_units (i.e., C + F >=10, so C + F =19,

---------------

 carryover=1), then in the tens digit:

B + E +1 must end with 9, so B + E +1 =9 or 19 (

---------------

if there's another carryover). Then carryover_from_tens would be 0 or1.

Then in hundreds place:

A + D + carryover_from_tens =9.

Similarly

---------------

, if there was a carryover_from_units of 1, then in the tens place:

If B + E +1 =9, then carryover_from_tens is 0,

or

---------------

 if B + E +1 =19, then carryover_from_tens is1, leading to A + D +1 =9 =>

---------------

 A + D=8.

Wait, so maybe there are more cases here where carryover_from_units is 1?

Wait, my

---------------

 previous analysis assumed c0 and c1 can only be 0, but maybe I was wrong. Let me re-examine.



---------------

Let me denote:

Let me define:

Let c0 = carryover from units to tens: floor( (C + F)/10 )

Similarly, c1 = carryover from tens to hundreds: floor( (B + E + c0)/10 )

Then the

---------------

 hundreds digit equation is A + D + c1 =9.

The units digit equation:

(C + F) =9 +10*c0.



---------------

The tens digit equation:

(B + E + c0) =9 +10*c1.

The hundreds digit equation:

(A + D) + c1 =9.

Additionally

---------------

, the vertical sum equation:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f)=99.

Now

---------------

, let's see possible values for c0 and c1.

Possible c0 can be 0 or 1, since C and F are digits (0

---------------

-9), so their sum can be up to 18, so c0 can be 0,1.

c1 can be 0 or1,

---------------

 because (B + E + c0) can be up to (9 +9 +1)=19, so floor(19/10)=1.

So

---------------

 possible cases are:

Case 1: c0=0, c1=0.

Case 2: c0=0, c1=1.

Case 3: c0=1, c1=0.

Case4: c0=1, c1=1.

Now

---------------

 let's check each case.

Case1: c0=0, c1=0.

Then:

C + F =9.

B + E =9.

A + D=9.

Then

---------------

 vertical sum equation:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f)=99.

But since

---------------

 d=9 -a,

e=9 -b,

f=9 -c,

so d + e + f =27 - (a + b + c).

Therefore

---------------

,

10S + (27 - S)=99,

so 9S=72 => S=8,



---------------

so a + b +c=8,

as before. So this is the previous case, with 45 solutions.

Case2: c0=0, c1=1.

Then

---------------

:

C + F=9 (since c0=0).

B + E +0 =9 +10*1=

---------------

19,

so B + E=19.

But B and E are digits (0-9), so their maximum sum is 18. So

---------------

 this is impossible. So Case2 invalid.

Case3: c0=1, c1=0.

Then:

C + F=9 +10*1=19.



---------------

So C and F must add to 19. Since they are digits, the only way is C=9 and F=10? No, digits

---------------

 are 0-9. So 9 +10? Not possible. The maximum C + F is 9+9=18. So

---------------

 this is impossible. Therefore, Case3 invalid.

Case4: c0=1, c1=1.

Then:

C + F=19 (

---------------

impossible, as above),

so this is invalid.

Therefore, only Case1 is valid, leading to 45 solutions.

Therefore, the answer is 45. Hmm

---------------

, so I think that's correct. But let me see if there's another angle.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different

---------------

 way to approach the problem that might reveal something else.

Let me consider the vertical sum equation again:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) =99.

But

---------------

 we also have from the horizontal sum:

100(a + d) +10(b + e) + (c + f)=999.

Let me denote

---------------

 variables:

Let me let S1 = a + d,

S2 = b + e,

S3 = c + f.

Then the

---------------

 horizontal equation is 100S1 +10S2 + S3 =999,

and the vertical equation is 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f)=99.

Note

---------------

 that a + b + c + d + e + f = (a +d) + (b +e) + (c +f) = S1 + S2 + S3.

Let

---------------

 me denote T = a + b + c,

then the vertical equation becomes 10T + ( (S1 + S2 + S3) - T ) =99,

since d + e + f = (S1 + S2 + S3) - T.

Therefore

---------------

:

10T + (S1 + S2 + S3 - T) =99,

so 9T + S1 + S2 + S3 =99.

But

---------------

 from the horizontal equation:

100S1 +10S2 + S3 =999.

So now we have two equations:

1) 100S1 +10S2 + S3 =999,

2) 9T + S1 + S2 + S3 =99.

But

---------------

 since T = a + b +c,

and S1 =a +d,

S2 =b +e,

S3 =c +f,

then

---------------

 S1 + S2 + S3 = (a +d) + (b +e) + (c +f)= (a +b +c) + (d +e +f)= T + (d +e +f).



---------------

But d +e +f = (S1 + S2 + S3) - T, which loops back. Maybe

---------------

 not helpful.

Alternatively, let me try to subtract equations or find a relation between them.

Let me subtract equation2 from equation1:

(100S1 +10S2 + S3) - (9T + S1 + S2 + S3) = 999 -99=

---------------

900.

This gives:

99S1 +9S2 -9T =900,

Divide both sides by9:

11S1 + S2 - T =100.

But T = a + b +c,

and S1 =a +d,

S2 =b +e,

Therefore

---------------

, substituting T:

11S1 + S2 - (a + b + c)=100.

But S

---------------

1 = a +d => a = S1 -d,

But not sure if helpful. Alternatively, express T in terms of S1, S2, S3.



---------------

Wait, T = a +b +c,

and S1 + S2 + S3 = (a +d)+(b +e)+(c +f) = (a +b +c) + (d +e +f) = T + (d +e +f).

Hmm

---------------

, perhaps this isn't helpful.

Alternatively, let me consider that from the horizontal equation:

100S1 +10S2 +S3 =999,

so

---------------

 S3 =999 -100S1 -10S2.

Plugging into equation2:

9T + S1 + S2 + (999 -100S1 -10S2)=99,

so

---------------

 9T + S1 + S2 +999 -100S1 -10S2=99,

s

---------------

implify:

9T -99S1 -9S2 +999 =99,

then,

9T -99S1 -9S2 = -900,

divide both sides by9:

T -11S1 -S2 = -100,

so T =11S1 + S2 -100.

But T = a + b +c,

and since

---------------

 a, b, c are digits (0-9 each), the maximum T can be is 27 (if all are 9), but in

---------------

 our case, since S1 =a +d, and d is a digit (0-9), so S1 can be at

---------------

 most 18 (if a=9 and d=9). Similarly, S2 can be up to 18.

Wait, but let

---------------

's see. Since S1 =a +d,

and from horizontal equation:

100S1 +10S2 +S3=999,

so

---------------

 each term must be such that 100S1 â‰¤999 => S1 â‰¤9.99, so S1 â‰¤9.



---------------

Similarly, 10S2 must be â‰¤999, but with S1 contributing, but actually, since S

---------------

1 is at most 9, then 100*9=900, so remaining 10S2 + S3 must

---------------

 be 99, so S2 can be up to 9 (if S3 is 9).

Wait, so

---------------

 S1 must be at most9.

Because if S1 were 10, then 100*10=1000 which

---------------

 already exceeds 999.

Therefore, S1 can be from 0 to9.

Similarly, S2 must be such that 10S2 â‰¤ 

---------------

999 -100S1 - S3,

but since S3 is at least 0, so 10S2 â‰¤ 999 -100S1,

so S2 â‰¤ (999 -100S1)/10,

but

---------------

 since S1 is up to9,

for S1=9: 999 -900=99,

---------------

 so S2 â‰¤9.9, so S2 â‰¤9,

for S1=8: 999-800=199,

---------------

 so S2 â‰¤19.9, but S2 is b + e, so maximum 18,

but since

---------------

 S2 must be an integer.

But in any case, S1 is between0 and9.

Therefore, let me see

---------------

:

Given that S1 can be from0 to9, and S2 can be from0 to (9 +9)=18,



---------------

but with constraints from the equations.

But perhaps this approach is more complex. Since we already have the previous analysis leading to 45, and

---------------

 cross-verified with examples, perhaps that is correct.

Therefore, I think the answer is 45. So I'll

---------------

 go with that.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{45}


To solve the problem, we need to find the number of ways to place digits in a 2x3 grid such that the sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows is 999, and the sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns is 99.

###

---------------

 Key Steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let the top row be digits \(a, b, c\) forming the number \(100a + 10b + c\).
   - Let the bottom row be digits \(d, e, f\) forming the number \(100d + 10e + f\).

2. **Equations from the Problem:**
   - The sum of the two 3-digit numbers: 
     \[
     (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
     \]
     This simplifies to:
     \[
     100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999
     \]
   - The sum of the three 2-digit numbers from the columns:
     \[
     (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99
     \]
     This simplifies to:
     \[
     10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99
     \]

3. **Analyzing the Equations:**
   - From

---------------

 the first equation, we consider the digits and their carries:
     - Units place: \(c + f = 9 + 10c_0\) where \(c_0\) is the carryover to

---------------

 the tens place.
     - Tens place: \(b + e + c_0 = 9 + 10c_1\) where \(c_1\) is the carryover to the hundreds place.
     - Hundreds place: \(a + d + c_1 = 9\).
   - Possible

---------------

 values for \(c_0\) and \(c_1\) are 0 or 1. Only valid combinations are found

---------------

 to be \(c_0 = 0\) and \(c_1 = 0\).

4. **Solving with

---------------

 Valid Carryovers:**
   - With \(c_0 = 0\) and \(c_1 = 0\):
     - \(a + d = 9\)
     - \(b + e = 9\)
     - \(c + f = 9\)
   - The vertical sum equation becomes:
     \[
     10(a + b + c) + (27 - (a + b + c)) = 99
     \]
     Solving this gives \(a + b + c = 8\).

5. **Counting Solutions:**
   - The number of non-negative integer solutions to \(a + b + c = 8\) is

---------------

 given by the stars and bars method:
     \[
     \binom{8 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{10}{2} = 45
     \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{45}
