Okay, so I need to solve this problem where there are two real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that two logarithmic equations hold: log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^(4y) also equals 10. And I need to find the product xy. Hmm, let me think

---------------

 step by step.

First, let me recall the logarithm properties. The logarithm log_b(a) is the exponent you need to raise b to get a. So, if log_x(y^x) = 10, that means x^10 = y^x. Similarly, log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 would mean that y^10 = x^{4y}. 

Wait, let me write

---------------

 that down properly. 

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the definition of logarithm, this translates

---------------

 to x^10 = y^x. 

Similarly, the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10,

---------------

 so y^10 = x^{4y}. 

So now I have two equations:

1) x^{10} = y^x

2) y^{10} = x^{4y}

Hmm, so

---------------

 I need to solve these two equations for x and y, both greater than 1, and find xy. 

This looks a bit complicated because the variables are in both the base and the exponent. Maybe taking logarithms on

---------------

 both sides would help? Let me try that.

Starting with the first equation: x^{10} = y^x. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

10 ln x = x ln y.

Similarly, for the second equation: y^{10} = x^{4y}, taking natural logs:

10 ln y = 4y ln x.

Hmm, so now I have:

Equation 1: 10 ln x = x ln y



---------------

Equation 2: 10 ln y = 4y ln x

Hmm, maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other. Let me see.

Let me denote ln x as A and ln y as B.

---------------

 Then the equations become:

Equation 1: 10 A = x B

Equation 2: 10 B = 4y A

But x and y are exponent

---------------

ials of A and B, since A = ln x ⇒ x = e^A, similarly y = e^B. Hmm

---------------

, but maybe that complicates things. Alternatively, maybe express ln y from the first equation and substitute into the second?

From the first equation: 10 ln x = x ln y ⇒ ln y = (10 / x) ln x.

Then

---------------

 plug this into the second equation:

10 * [(10 / x) ln x] = 4y ln x.

Wait

---------------

, let me check. The second equation is 10 ln y = 4y ln x. So substituting ln y from the first equation:



---------------

10*(10/(x) * ln x) = 4y ln x.

Simplify left side: (100 / x) ln x = 4y ln x.

Assuming ln x is not zero (since x >1, so ln x >0), we can divide both sides by ln x:

100/x = 4y

Therefore

---------------

, y = (100)/(4x) = 25/x.

So y is 25 over x. Okay

---------------

, that's a relation between y and x. So now, if I can express y in terms of x, maybe substitute back into one of the original equations.

Let me recall

---------------

 that we had from the first equation: ln y = (10/x) ln x. Since y =25/x, then

---------------

 ln y = ln(25/x) = ln25 - ln x.

Therefore, substituting into that expression:

ln25 - ln x = (10/x) ln x.

Hmm, so that

---------------

 gives an equation in terms of x only. Let me write that:

ln25 - ln x = (10 / x) * ln x.

Let me denote ln x as t,

---------------

 so that ln25 - t = (10 / x) * t. But x is e^t, since t = ln x ⇒ x = e^t. Therefore

---------------

, substituting x as e^t:

ln25 - t = (10 / e^t) * t.

Hmm, but

---------------

 that might complicate things with exponentials. Alternatively, maybe rearrange terms:

Bring all terms to one side:

ln25 = t + (10 t)/x.

But x is e^t, so x

---------------

 = e^t, so substituting:

ln25 = t + (10 t)/e^t.

Hmm, this

---------------

 seems a bit tricky. Maybe there's a better way. Let me see if I can find x such that this equation holds. Let

---------------

 me think if there is an integer or simple value that satisfies this.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another substitution or approach. Let's see

---------------

.

Alternatively, since we have y =25/x, substitute this into the first equation. Wait, the first original equation was x^{10} = y^x. Since

---------------

 y is 25/x, then:

x^{10} = (25/x)^x

So, x^{10} = (25^x)/(x^x)

Multiply both sides by x^x:

x^{10} * x^x = 25^x

Which

---------------

 is x^{x +10} =25^x

Divide both sides by x^x:

x^{10} = (25^x)/x^x =

---------------

 (25/x)^x

Wait, that's going back to the same equation. Hmm.

Alternatively, taking the equation x^{10} = (25/x)^x,

---------------

 which can be written as x^{10} =25^x /x^x, so multiplying both sides by x^x gives x^{x +10} =25^x.

Then

---------------

, taking both sides to the power of 1/x:

x^{1 +10/x} =25.

Hmm, so

---------------

 x^{1 +10/x} =25. Let me write that as x^{(x +10)/x} =25.

Hmm

---------------

, maybe taking natural logs again:

[(x +10)/x] * ln x = ln25

So,



---------------

(1 + 10/x) * ln x = ln25

Hmm, so this is similar to the previous equation.

---------------

 Let me see if I can find x here. Let me think of possible integer values for x. Let me try x=5.



---------------

Testing x=5:

Left side: (1 +10/5)*ln5 = (1+2)*ln5 =3*ln5 ≈3*1.609≈4.827. But ln25 is ln(5^2)=2 ln5≈3.218*2≈3.218*2=

---------------

6.438. Not equal. So that's not right.

Wait, wait, ln25 is ln(25)

---------------

≈3.218? Wait, no, ln(25) is ln(5²)=2 ln5≈2*1.609≈3.218?

---------------

 Wait, no, 1.609*2 is about 3.218? Wait, actually ln5 is approximately 1.609, so 2*1.609≈3.218. But

---------------

 25 is e^3.218? Wait, but 25 is 5 squared, so ln

---------------

25 is indeed 2 ln5≈3.218, so if x=5, then left side is

---------------

 3*ln5≈4.828, which is less than ln25≈3.218? Wait, no

---------------

, wait, 3*1.609 is 4.828, which is greater than 3.218. Wait, but

---------------

 4.828 is greater than 3.218. So that's not equal. Hmm.

Wait

---------------

, perhaps x=25?

Let me try x=25:

Left side: (1 +10/25)*ln25 = (1 +0.4)*ln25 =

---------------

1.4 * ln25 ≈1.4*3.218≈4.505. But

---------------

 ln25 is 3.218, so 1.4 times that is about 4.505, which is not

---------------

 equal to ln25≈3.218. Not equal.

Hmm, maybe x= 10?

Left

---------------

 side: (1 +10/10)*ln10 = (2)*ln10≈2*2.302≈4.605. ln

---------------

25 is ~3.218. Not equal.

Hmm. Maybe x= something else. Let me see.

---------------

 Let me think of x=5^(something). Let me suppose that x is 5^k, then maybe y=

---------------

25/x=25/(5^k)=5^(2 -k). Maybe that can help?

Let me try

---------------

 x=5^k. Then y=5^{2 -k}. Let me see if this substitution helps.

First equation: x^{10} = y^x.



---------------

Substituting x=5^k and y=5^{2 -k}:

(5^k)^10 = (5^{2 -k})^{5^k}

Left side:5^{10k}

Right side:5^{(2 -k)*5^k}

Therefore

---------------

, 10k = (2 -k)*5^k.

Hmm, so 10k = (2 -k) 5^k.

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 this can be manageable. Let me see if I can find k here.

Let me try k=1:

Left:10*1=10,

---------------

 Right: (2-1)*5^1=1*5=5. Not equal.

k=2:

Left:10*2=20, Right: (2-2)*5^2=0*25=0. Not.

k=0: Not

---------------

 allowed, since x must be greater than1, so k>0.

k=0.5:

Left:10*0.5=5,

---------------

 Right: (2 -0.5)*5^{0.5}=1.5*sqrt(5)≈1.5*2.236≈3.354. Not equal.

Hmm, maybe

---------------

 k= something else. Let me try k= log base 5 of something?

Alternatively, perhaps trying k= log_

---------------

5 (something). Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe let me think of the second equation again. Since we had y=25/x, so

---------------

 if I can also use the second equation, which was y^{10}=x^{4y}. Let me substitute y=25/x here.

So,

---------------

 (25/x)^{10} =x^{4*(25/x)}.

Hmm, that's (25^{10})/(x^{10}) =x^{100/x}*x^4? Wait, no,

---------------

 4*(25/x) is 100/x, so exponent is 100/x. Wait, 

---------------

4y is 4*(25/x). So exponent is 4y=100/x. Wait, so

---------------

 right side is x^{(100)/x}.

Therefore, equation becomes:

(25/x)^{10} =x^{100/x}

Let

---------------

 me write 25 as 5², so 25/x is (5²)/x. Then left side is (5²/x)^10 =5^{20}/x^{10}

So

---------------

, 5^{20}/x^{10} =x^{100/x}

Multiply both sides by x^{10}:

5^{20}=x^{100/x +10}

Hmm, so

---------------

 5^{20}=x^{(10x +100)/x}

Taking natural logs:

20 ln5 = [(10x +100)/x] ln x

Hmm, so

---------------

 20 ln5 = (10(x +10)/x) ln x.

Divide both sides by 10:

2 ln5 = ( (x +10)/x ) ln x

Which is the same as (

---------------

1 +10/x) ln x = 2 ln5

Wait a second, that's exactly the equation we had earlier!

---------------

 So that's consistent. So, whether we use first equation or second equation, we end up with the same equation. So that

---------------

's good.

So, the key equation is (1 +10/x) ln x = 2 ln5.

Hmm

---------------

, so solving (1 +10/x) ln x = 2 ln5.

Wait, perhaps if I let x=5, then

---------------

:

Left side: (1 +10/5)*ln5= (3)*ln5 ≈3*1.609≈4.827,

---------------

 and 2 ln5≈3.218. Not equal.

Hmm, but if x=25:

Left side: (1 +10/25)*ln25 = (1.4)*(3.218)≈4.505, which

---------------

 is more than 2 ln5≈3.218. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps x= sqrt(5^

---------------

something). Maybe x=5^a, so let me try substituting x=5^a, so that ln x =a ln5. Then:



---------------

Equation becomes (1 +10/(5^a)) * a ln5 = 2 ln5.

Divide both sides by ln5:

(1 +10/(5^a)) *a =2

So,

a + (10a)/5^a =2.

Hmm, so

---------------

 need to solve for a in:

a + (10a)/5^a =2.

Hmm, perhaps trying a

---------------

=1:

1 + (10*1)/5^1 =1 + 2=3≠2.

a=0.5:

0.5 + (10*0.5)/5^0.5=

---------------

0.5 +5/sqrt(5)=0.5 +5/(2.236)≈0.5 +2.236≈2.736>2.

Hmm, a=0. Let's see a

---------------

=0. Not valid, since x>1 implies a>0.

a=2:

2 + (20)/25=2 +0.8=2.8≠2.

Hmm, a=?



---------------

Let me see, perhaps a= log_5 (something). Alternatively, trying a= ln something?

Alternatively, maybe a

---------------

=10/x term? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps trying a=0. Let's see, but x>1,

---------------

 so a must be positive. Maybe a=0. Let me see, but no.

Alternatively, perhaps trying a=0

---------------

. Let me think.

Wait, maybe trying a= (something between 0.5 and 1). Let me try a=0.7

---------------

:

0.7 + (10*0.7)/5^0.7 ≈0.7 +7/(5^0.7). What

---------------

 is 5^0.7?

5^0.7= e^{0.7 ln5}≈ e^{0.7*1.609}≈e^{1.126}≈3.085.

So 7/3.085≈2.27. So total≈

---------------

0.7+2.27≈2.97>2.

Hmm, still too big.

a=0.6:

0.6 + (6)/5^0.6.



---------------

5^0.6≈e^{0.6*1.609}=e^{0.965}≈2.627.

Thus 6/2.627≈2.285. Total≈0.6+2.285≈2.885.



---------------

Still higher than 2.

Hmm, a=0.4:

0.4 + (4)/5^0.4.

5^0.4≈e^{0.4*1.609}=e^0.643≈1.901.

So

---------------

 4/1.901≈2.104. Total≈0.4 +2.104≈2.504.

Still too

---------------

 big. Hmm.

Hmm, maybe a=0.2?

0.2 + (2)/5^0.2.

5^0.2≈e^{0.2*1.609}=e^0.322≈1.38.

2/1.38≈1.449. So total≈0.2+1.449≈1.649 <2. So between a=0.2 and a=0.4,

---------------

 the function crosses 2?

Wait, but at a=0.2, it's 1.649,

---------------

 a=0.3:

0.3 + (3)/5^0.3.

5^0.3≈e^{0.3*1.609}=e^0.482≈1.619.

3/1.619≈1.853. Total≈0.3+1.853≈2.153>

---------------

2. So between a=0.2 and a=0.3.

At a=0.25:

0.25 + (2.5)/5^0.25.

5^0.25=

---------------

 sqrt(sqrt5)≈1.495.

2.5/1.495≈1.673. Total≈0.25+1.673≈1.923 <

---------------

2.

Hmm, so between a=0.25 and 0.3. Let me try a=0.28.

a

---------------

=0.28:

0.28 + (2.8)/5^0.28.

5^0.28≈

---------------

e^{0.28*1.609}=e^{0.4505}≈1.568.

2.8/1.568≈1.789. Total≈0.28+1.789≈2.069.



---------------

Close to 2.069, which is over 2. Let's try a=0.27:

0.27 + (2.7)/5^0.27.

5^0.27≈e^{0.27*1.609}=e^0.434≈1.544.

2.7/1.544≈1.749. Total≈0.27 +1.749≈2.019.

Still

---------------

 over 2. a=0.26:

0.26 + 2.6 /5^0.26.

5^0.26≈e^{0.26*1.609}=e^0.418≈1.519.

2.6 /1.519≈1.712. Total≈0.26+1.712≈1.972.



---------------

Hmm, so between 0.26 and 0.27.

a=0.265:

0.265 + (2.65)/5^0.265.

5^0.265≈e^{0.265*1.609}=e^(0.265*1.609)=

---------------

 e^(0.426)= approx 1.531.

2.65 /1.531≈1.729. So total≈0.265 +1.729≈1.994.



---------------

Almost 2. Close.

a=0.266:

0.266 + (2.66)/5^0.266.

5^0.266≈e^{0.266*1.609}= e

---------------

^(0.428)≈1.534.

2.66/1.534≈1.735. Total≈0.266 +1.735≈2.001.

So

---------------

 that's very close to 2. So a≈0.266.

Hmm, so approximately a≈0.266. Thus

---------------

 x=5^a≈5^0.266. Let me compute 5^0.266:

Take

---------------

 natural log: ln(5^0.266)=0.266*1.609≈0.428. So e^0.428≈1.534. So x≈1.534.



---------------

Hmm, so x is approximately 1.534, then y=25/x≈25/1.534≈16.3.

But the

---------------

 problem states that x and y are real numbers greater than 1. So maybe there is an exact solution here?

Alternatively, perhaps there

---------------

's a substitution I can make. Let me think again.

We had the equation (1 +10/x) ln x = 2 ln5. Let me see

---------------

 if I can manipulate this equation into a form that allows substitution.

Let me set t = x/5. Let me see,

---------------

 maybe that helps? Let x=5t. Then, substituting into the equation:

(1 +10/(5t)) * ln(5t) = 2 ln5.

Simplify 10/(5t)=2/t,

---------------

 so:

(1 + 2/t) * [ln5 + ln t] = 2 ln5.

Hmm, expanding

---------------

 this:

[ (1)(ln5) + (1)(ln t) + (2/t)(ln5) + (2/t)(ln t) ] = 2 ln5.

Hmm, not

---------------

 sure if that helps. Let me see:

Bring all terms to left side:

(1 + 2/t)(ln5 + ln t) -2 ln5 =0.

Hmm

---------------

, expanding:

(ln5 + ln t) + (2/t)(ln5 + ln t) -2 ln5=0

Combine

---------------

 terms:

ln5 + ln t -2 ln5 + (2/t)(ln5 + ln t)=0

So

---------------

,

- ln5 + ln t + (2/t)(ln5 + ln t)=0

Hmm, still complicated. Maybe another

---------------

 substitution?

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is designed to have x and y as powers of 5? Since 25 is 5 squared.

---------------

 Let me see.

Suppose x is 5^a and y is 5^b. Then, since y=25/x=25/(5^a)=5^{2 -a}, so b=2 -a. Let

---------------

 me try this substitution.

Let x=5^a, y=5^{2−a}. Then, plug into original

---------------

 equations.

First equation: log_x(y^x)=10. Let's compute log base x of y^x.

log

---------------

_{5^a}( (5^{2−a})^{5^a} )

= log_{5^a}(5^{(2−a)5^a} )

= [(2 -a)5^a] / a,

---------------

 since log_{5^a}(5^k)=k/a.

Set this equal to 10:

[(2 -a)5^a]/a =10.



---------------

Second equation: log_y(x^{4y})=10.

Similarly, log_{5^{2−a}} ( (5^a)^{4*5^{2−a}} )

= log_{5^{2−a}} (5^{a*4*5^{2−a}} )

= [a *4*5^{2−a} ] / (2 -a) =10.

So,

---------------

 the second equation is [4a*5^{2 -a}]/(2 -a)=10.

So now, we have two equations:

1) [(2 -a)5^a]/a =10



---------------

2) [4a*5^{2 -a}]/(2 -a)=10

Hmm, perhaps we

---------------

 can denote equation1 and equation2 and multiply them together?

Multiplying equation1 and equation2:

[(2 -a)5^a /a ] * [4a*5^{2 -a}/(2 -a)] =10*10=100.

Simplify left

---------------

 side:

The (2 -a) cancels, a cancels with the a in denominator, so:

5^a *4 *5^{2 -a}=4*5^{a + (2 -a)}=4*5^2=4*25=100.

So indeed

---------------

, the product is 100=100. So, that doesn't give us new information. So,

---------------

 the two equations are dependent. So, we need to solve one of them for a.

Let me take equation1: [(2 -a)5^a]/a =10.

Let me rearrange:



---------------

(2 -a)5^a =10a.

Hmm, trying to find a such that this holds.

Let

---------------

 me try a=1:

Left: (2-1)*5^1=1*5=5, right:10*1=10. Not equal.

a=0.5:

Left: (2-0.5)*5^0.5=1.5*sqrt(5)≈1.5*2.236≈3.354.

---------------

 Right:10*0.5=5. Not equal.

a=2:

Left: (2-2)*5^2=0*25=0. Right:10*2=20. Not.

a=0

---------------

. Let's see, but a must be positive. Hmm.

Wait, maybe a= log_5 something? Not sure. Alternatively, let

---------------

 me try a= log_5 (something).

Alternatively, let me try a= ln(10a)/(ln5) +

---------------

 something. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, let me try a=0. Let me see, but a>0.

---------------

 Maybe a= (something between 0.5 and 1). Let me try a=0. Let me think.



---------------

Wait, perhaps a= (2/3). Let me try a=2/3≈0.6667.

Left side: (2 -2/3)*5^{2/3}≈(4/3)*(5^{2/3}).

5^{2/3}=cube

---------------

 root of 25≈2.924.

So 4/3 *2.924≈3.898. Right side:10*(2/3)≈6.666. Not equal.

Hmm. Maybe

---------------

 a=0. Let me try a=0.4.

a=0.4:

Left side: (2 -0.4)*5^0.4≈1.6*(5^0.4).

5^0.4≈e^{0.4*ln5}≈e^{0.4*1.609}=e^0.643≈1.901.

Thus,

---------------

 1.6*1.901≈3.042. Right side:10*0.4=4. Not equal.

Hmm, a

---------------

=0.3:

Left: (2-0.3)*5^0.3≈1.7*(1

---------------

.619)≈2.752. Right:3. Not equal.

Hmm. Maybe a=0. Let me see

---------------

, perhaps trying a=0.2:

Left: (2 -0.2)*5^0.2≈1.8*(1.379)≈2.482. Right:2. So

---------------

 close?

Wait, 10a=2 when a=0.2, so right side is 2. Left

---------------

 is 1.8*1.379≈2.482>2. Hmm.

Hmm, so

---------------

 if a=0.2, left is ~2.48, right is 2. So need a bit higher

---------------

 a to make left smaller?

Wait, when a increases from 0.2 to 0.3, left decreases from ~2.48 to ~2.75? Wait no, no

---------------

, wait when a=0.2, left is (1.8)*1.379≈2.48,

---------------

 and when a=0.3, (1.7)*(1.619)≈2.75?

---------------

 Wait that's actually increasing?

Wait, no, 5^{a} increases as a increases, so (2 -a) decreases as

---------------

 a increases, so the product may have a minimum?

Hmm, perhaps plotting the function would help, but since I can't do that here, maybe

---------------

 trying a=0.25:

Left: (2 -0.25)*5^0.25≈1.75*1.495≈2.616. Right:10*0.25=2.5. So

---------------

 left≈2.616 vs right=2.5. Close.

Hmm, so at a=0.25, left is

---------------

 2.616 vs 2.5. Hmm. Let's try a=0.26:

Left: (2 -0.26)=1.74;

---------------

 5^0.26≈e^{0.26*1.609}=e^0.418≈1.518. So 1.74*1.518≈2.64.

---------------

 Right:10*0.26=2.6. So left≈2.64 vs right=2.6. Close

---------------

.

a=0.265:

Left: (2-0.265)=1.735; 5^0.265≈e

---------------

^{0.426}=1.531. 1.735*1.531≈2.655

---------------

. Right:2.65. Hmm, so close.

a=0.266:

Left: (2 -0.266)=1.734; 5^0.266≈e

---------------

^{0.266*1.609}=e^0.428≈1.534. 1.734 *1.534≈2.658

---------------

. Right:10*0.266=2.66. So left≈2.658 vs right≈2.66. Very

---------------

 close. So a≈0.266.

So approximately, a≈0.266, so x=5^a≈1.534, and y=25/x≈16.3. But

---------------

 the problem says "real numbers", so maybe there's an exact solution here? Let me check if there's an exact value.

Wait, let

---------------

 me think again. The equations are symmetric in some way. Let me see if there's a substitution where x*y is a constant.

---------------

 Since we need to find xy.

Wait, suppose that xy =k. Maybe if I can find k such that equations are satisfied.

---------------

 Let me see.

Let me let k=xy. Since y=25/x, then k= x*(25/x)=25. Wait, so

---------------

 that would mean xy=25? But if that's the case, then regardless of x and y, as long as y=25/x, their product is 25. Wait, but

---------------

 is that possible?

Wait, hold on. The problem states that both x and y are greater than 1, so their

---------------

 product is 25? Let me check if that's consistent with the equations.

Wait, if xy=25, then y

---------------

=25/x, which is exactly the relation we had earlier. So, the product is 25. But let

---------------

 me confirm if that's indeed the case.

Wait, because the equations lead us to y=25/x, so their

---------------

 product is 25. So, regardless of the values of x and y (as long as they satisfy the equations), their product must be 25. Therefore

---------------

, the answer is 25?

Wait, but in the problem, it says "Find xy". So, maybe the

---------------

 answer is 25?

But wait, let me think again. The problem says "There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that...",

---------------

 so if the equations lead to xy=25, then the answer is 25. But let me confirm with the equations.

From

---------------

 the first equation, we derived that y=25/x, so indeed, xy=25. So regardless of the

---------------

 specific x and y, their product must be 25. Therefore, the answer is 25.

Wait, but why

---------------

 did I go through all that trouble solving for a? Maybe I overcomplicated it. Let me see.

Wait, the

---------------

 first equation gives x^{10}=y^x, and second equation gives y^{10}=x^{4y}. From

---------------

 the first equation, we can write y =x^{10/x}. Then substitute this into the second equation:

(y)^10 = (x^{10/x})^10 =x^{100/x}=x^{4y}



---------------

But since y= x^{10/x}, so 4y=4x^{10/x}

Thus, equation becomes x^{100/x}=x^{4x^{10/x}}

Therefore, ex

---------------

ponents must be equal (since x>1, so the function is injective):

100/x =4x^{10/x}

Hmm, but

---------------

 this might not help directly. Wait, but if we let’s see, since we already have that y=25/x, so

---------------

 maybe substituting that into the second equation gives us the same relation. So perhaps the key point is that y=25/x, so their

---------------

 product is 25. Therefore, the answer is 25. So perhaps the problem is designed so that even if you

---------------

 can't find exact x and y, their product is fixed?

Wait, but let me check with my approximate values. If x≈1.534, then y≈16.3, and

---------------

 their product is≈25. So that seems correct. So the answer is 25.

Wait, but the problem didn

---------------

't specify that x and y have to be integers, so even if they are not nice numbers, their product is fixed.

---------------

 Therefore, the answer is 25. So I think that's it. So the answer is 25.

Wait

---------------

, but let me confirm once more with the equations.

Starting with log_x(y^x)=10 ⇒ x^{10}=y^x.



---------------

log_y(x^{4y})=10 ⇒ y^{10}=x^{4y}.

If we let

---------------

’s suppose that xy=25, so y=25/x. Then substituting into first equation:

x^{10} = (25/x)^x ⇒x^{10}=

---------------

25^x/x^x ⇒x^{10+x}=25^x ⇒x^{x+10}=25^x ⇒(

---------------

x)^{x+10}= (5^2)^x ⇒x^{x+10}=5^{2x}

Taking

---------------

 both sides to the power 1/x:

x^{1 +10/x}=5^2 ⇒x^{1 +10/x}=25.

Which

---------------

 is the equation we had before. So, this equation must hold, but regardless of the solution to this equation, the product xy is fixed

---------------

 at 25. Therefore, even if we can't solve for x and y explicitly, their product is always 25. Therefore

---------------

, the answer is 25.

Yes, that makes sense. I think I overcomplicated by trying to find exact values of

---------------

 x and y, but the problem only asks for their product, which is fixed by the relation y=25/x. Therefore, the answer is 25.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{25}


Given the equations \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\), we start by converting these logarithmic equations into their exponential forms.

For the first equation:
\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10 \implies x^{10} = y^x
\]

For the second equation:
\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \implies y^{10} = x^{4y}
\]

We then express \(y\) in terms of \(x\) from the first equation. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of \(x^{10} = y^x\), we get:
\[
10 \ln x = x \ln y \implies \ln y = \frac{10}{x} \ln x
\]

Substituting \(\ln y = \frac{10}{x} \ln x\) into the second equation, we first

---------------

 convert it to natural logarithms:
\[
10 \ln y = 4y \ln x
\]

Substituting \(\ln y\) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
10 \left( \frac{10}{x} \ln x \right) = 4y \ln x
\]

Simplifying, we get:
\[
\frac{100}{x} \ln x = 4y \ln x
\]

Assuming \(\ln x \neq 0\) (since \(x > 1\)), we can divide both sides by \(\ln x\):
\[
\frac{100}{x} = 4y \implies y = \frac{25}{x}
\]

Thus, we find that \(y = \frac{25}{x}\). The product \(xy\) is therefore:
\[
xy = x \left( \frac{25}{x} \right) = 25
\]

This

---------------

 result holds regardless of the specific values of \(x\) and \(y\) as long as they satisfy the original equations. Hence, the product \(xy\) is indeed

---------------

 fixed at 25.

\boxed{25}
