Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths. The question is asking for the distance from the incenter (I think that's what point I is)

---------------

 to each face, and then to express that distance in a particular form and find the sum m + n + p. Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to recall that in a tetrahedron, the incenter is the point equidistant from all four faces, and this distance is called the inradius. The formula for the inradius (r) of a tetrahedron is given by the volume (V) divided by the surface area (A), but actually, wait

---------------

, no, hold on. For a tetrahedron, the formula is r = 3V / A, where A is the total surface area. Wait

---------------

, let me confirm that. In a tetrahedron, the inradius is indeed 3 times the volume divided by the sum of the areas of the four faces. Yeah

---------------

, because the volume can be expressed as (1/3) * surface area * inradius. So Volume = (1/3) * (sum of face areas) * r,

---------------

 so solving for r gives r = 3V / (sum of face areas). So that's the formula I need to use here.

So,

---------------

 to find the inradius, I need to compute the volume of the tetrahedron and the areas of all its faces, then plug into that formula. But

---------------

 first, I need to find the volume and the areas of the faces. The problem gives all the edge lengths, so maybe I can compute the volume using the given edge lengths?



---------------

Hmm, the edges are given as AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), and BC = AD = sqrt(89). This

---------------

 seems symmetric in some way. The edges are paired: AB and CD, AC and BD, BC and AD. That makes

---------------

 me think the tetrahedron might have some kind of symmetry. Maybe it's a isohedral tetrahedron or something?

---------------

 Not sure, but perhaps I can use coordinates to model this tetrahedron.

Let me try to assign coordinates to the vertices such

---------------

 that calculations are manageable. Let me place the points in 3D space. Let's see, maybe set vertex A at (0,0,0). Then perhaps

---------------

 set vertex B along the x-axis, so B is (x,0,0). Then vertex C in the xy-plane, so (a,b,0), and D somewhere in 3D space (c,d,e). But maybe

---------------

 there's a better way to set coordinates to exploit the symmetry.

Alternatively, since the edges are paired, perhaps this tetrahedron is "equ

---------------

ifacial" or something? Wait, but equifacial means all faces are congruent, which might not be the case here. Alternatively

---------------

, maybe it's a disphenoid? A disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, which is exactly the case here:

---------------

 AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. So yes, this is a disphenoid. Disphenoids have some properties that might help

---------------

. For instance, all faces are congruent if it's a regular disphenoid, but here the edges are just opposite

---------------

 edges equal, so maybe the faces aren't congruent but have some symmetry.

In any case, perhaps using coordinates is the way to go. Let me try to set coordinates such

---------------

 that the centroid is at the origin or something? Alternatively, let's try to set coordinates so that the edges correspond in a symmetric way.

Let

---------------

 me recall that for a disphenoid, you can place the vertices at (a,b,c), (-a,-b,c), (-a,b,-c), (a,-b,-c) for some a,b,c. Wait

---------------

, maybe that's a standard coordinate system for a disphenoid. Let me check that.

Alternatively, perhaps place the vertices

---------------

 in such a way that the coordinates can be set to exploit the edge equalities. Let me try to set vertex A at (0,0,0), vertex B at (x,0,0), vertex D at (0,0,z), and

---------------

 then see where C would be. Hmm, but maybe that complicates things. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe use

---------------

 vectors. Let me denote vectors for points A, B, C, D. Since opposite edges are equal, maybe there's some symmetry

---------------

 here. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps use the formula for volume in terms of edge lengths. There is a formula called the Cayley-Menger determinant which can compute the volume of a tetrahedron given all its edge lengths. Since all edge lengths are given here, maybe

---------------

 that's the way to go.

Yes, that might be a good approach. Let me recall the Cayley-Menger determinant.

---------------

 For a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f, the volume V is given by:

V = sqrt( (CM)/288 ), where CM is the determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   a²   b²   c²  |
| 1   a²  0    d²   e²  |
| 1   b²  d²   0    f²  |
| 1   c²  e²   f²   0   |

So,

---------------

 plugging in the given edge lengths here. Let me note down the edges again:

AB = sqrt(41), so AB² = 41

CD = sqrt(41), so CD² =41

AC = sqrt(80), so AC²=80

BD= sqrt(80), so BD²=80

BC = sqrt(89), so BC²=89

AD = sqrt(89), so AD²=89

Wait, hold

---------------

 on, need to be careful with the edge labeling here. Let me make sure of the edges:

In the problem, edges

---------------

 are:

AB = CD = sqrt(41),

AC = BD = sqrt(80),

BC = AD = sqrt(89).

Therefore, edges

---------------

:

AB: between A and B: length sqrt(41)

AC: between A and C: sqrt(80)

AD: between A and D: sqrt(89)

BC: between B and C: sqrt(89)

BD: between B and D: sqrt(80)

CD: between C and D: sqrt(41)

So,

---------------

 edges between A and B: AB² = 41,

between A and C: AC² =80,

between A and D: AD² =89,

between B and C: BC²=89,

between B and D: BD²=80,

between C and D: CD²=41.

Therefore, in

---------------

 terms of the Cayley-Menger determinant, the variables are:

a = AB = sqrt(41) so a² =41,

b = AC = sqrt(80) so b²=80,

c = AD = sqrt(89) so c²=89,

d = BC = sqrt(89) so d²=89,

e = BD = sqrt(80) so e²=80,

f = CD = sqrt(41) so f²=41.

Therefore, the

---------------

 Cayley-Menger determinant matrix is:

Row 0: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Row 1: [1, 0, 41, 80, 89]

Row 2: [1, 41, 0, 89, 80]

Row 3: [1, 80, 89, 0, 41]

Row 4: [1, 89, 80, 41, 0]

Wait

---------------

, hold on, let me make sure of the order. The Cayley-Menger matrix is defined with the points in order A,B,C,D. So

---------------

 the rows and columns correspond to the points A,B,C,D with an extra dimension. Let me confirm the exact order.

The

---------------

 standard Cayley-Menger matrix for points A,B,C,D,E (but here we have four points) would be a 5x5 matrix where

---------------

 the first row and column are all ones except the first entry is zero, and then the next rows and columns correspond to the squared distances between the points. The

---------------

 exact positions can be a bit tricky, but let me check again.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for four points A,B,C,D is:



---------------

CM = determinant of the matrix:

[ 0   1        1        1        1     ]

[ 1   0      AB²     AC²     AD²  

---------------

 ]

[ 1  AB²     0      BC²     BD²   ]

[ 1  AC²    BC²      0      CD²   ]

[ 1  AD²    BD²     CD²      0     ]

Wait, is

---------------

 that the correct arrangement? Let me verify.

Yes, I think so. The first row is [0,1,1,1,1], first column is [0,1,1,1,1]^T. Then the entry

---------------

 at row 2, column 2 is 0 (distance from A to A), then row 2, column 3 is AB² (distance from A to B),

---------------

 row 2, column 4 is AC², row 2, column 5 is AD². Then row 3, column 3 is 0, column 4 is AB² again

---------------

? Wait no, row 3 corresponds to point B, so the next entries would be distances from B to other points. Wait

---------------

, actually, the rows and columns after the first correspond to points A,B,C,D. So the entry at row i, column j (for i,j >=

---------------

2) is the squared distance between point (i-1) and point (j-1).

Wait, perhaps it's better to write

---------------

 it out step by step. Let me consider the points as A,B,C,D. The Cayley-Menger matrix is a 5x5 matrix:



---------------

First row: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Second row: [1, 0, AB², AC², AD²]

Third row: [1, AB², 0, BC², BD²]

Fourth row: [1, AC², BC², 0, CD²]

Fifth row: [1, AD², BD², CD², 0]

Yes, that seems correct. Therefore, in

---------------

 our case, the entries are:

Second row (for point A): 0, AB²=41, AC²=80, AD²=89

Third row (for point B): AB²=41, 0, BC²=89, BD²=80

Fourth row (for point C): AC²=80, BC²=89, 0, CD²=41

Fifth row (for point D): AD²=89, BD²=80, CD²=41, 0

So,

---------------

 putting all that into the matrix:

Row 0: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Row 1: [1, 0, 41, 80, 89]

Row 2: [1, 41, 0, 89, 80]

Row 3: [1, 80, 89, 0, 41]

Row 4: [1, 89, 80, 41, 0]

Now

---------------

, we need to compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix, then take the square root of (determinant divided by 288) to get the volume.

This

---------------

 determinant calculation might be tedious, but maybe there's some symmetry or pattern we can exploit.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it step by step. Let me note

---------------

 that computing a 5x5 determinant is going to be time-consuming, but since the problem is symmetric, maybe the determinant simpl

---------------

ifies.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a better approach. Wait, given that the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, maybe

---------------

 there is a formula for its volume?

Let me recall that in a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated if we know the edge lengths. Since

---------------

 opposite edges are equal, the volume formula might be simpler.

Alternatively, since it's a disphenoid, maybe it can be inscribed in a rectangular box in

---------------

 a symmetric way. Let me think about that.

In a disphenoid, you can sometimes place the vertices at the vertices

---------------

 of a rectangular box such that each edge of the tetrahedron is a face diagonal of the box. Let me try

---------------

 to see if that works here.

Suppose the edges AB, AC, AD correspond to the edges of the box, but no

---------------

, maybe not. Wait, let me think again.

Alternatively, if the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, it

---------------

 can be embedded in a rectangular box with edges of lengths p, q, r, such that the edges of the tetrahedron are the face diagonals. For

---------------

 a disphenoid, the three pairs of opposite edges are equal, which correspond to the three face diagonals of the box. The

---------------

 edges of the tetrahedron would then be the face diagonals of the box. Therefore, if the edges of the box are p, q, r, then the face diagonals would be sqrt(p² + q²), sqrt(p² + r²), sqrt(q² + r²). These

---------------

 correspond to the three pairs of equal edges in the tetrahedron.

Wait, in our problem, the three pairs of edges are sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Therefore

---------------

, these should correspond to the three face diagonals of the box. So, let me denote:

sqrt(p² + q²) = sqrt(41),

sqrt(p² + r²) = sqrt(80),

sqrt(q² + r²) = sqrt(89).

Wait

---------------

, but let's check:

Wait, the three face diagonals would be sqrt(p²+q²), sqrt(p² + r²), sqrt(q² + r²). These

---------------

 should correspond to the three different edge lengths of the tetrahedron. Since in our tetrahedron, the edges come in pairs: AB

---------------

=CD= sqrt(41), AC=BD= sqrt(80), BC=AD= sqrt(89). So each

---------------

 pair corresponds to a face diagonal. Therefore, the three different edge lengths are sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Therefore

---------------

, setting:

sqrt(p² + q²) = sqrt(41),

sqrt(p² + r²) = sqrt(80),

sqrt(q² + r²) = sqrt(89).

So

---------------

, if we can solve for p, q, r, then the volume of the tetrahedron would be (p*q*r)/3, since the tetrahedron would

---------------

 occupy 1/3 of the volume of the box. Wait, is that right?

Wait, in a rectangular box, if you take the

---------------

 tetrahedron formed by four alternate vertices (i.e., a regular tetrahedron if the box is a cube), then

---------------

 the volume is indeed 1/3 of the box's volume. But in this case, since it's a disphenoid, perhaps

---------------

 the same applies?

Wait, actually, the volume of a disphenoid can indeed be calculated as (4 * p * q * r)/3,

---------------

 but I need to confirm.

Alternatively, perhaps the volume of the tetrahedron is (p*q*r)/3.

---------------

 Let me see.

Suppose the box has dimensions p, q, r. Then the tetrahedron formed by two opposite edges of

---------------

 the box would have volume 1/3 of the box? Hmm, perhaps not exactly. Let me think.

Alternatively, if

---------------

 the tetrahedron is formed by four vertices of the box such that each edge of the tetrahedron is a face diagonal, then the

---------------

 volume can be found as follows:

Let me consider coordinates. Let the box have edges along the axes with lengths p, q, r. Let the

---------------

 vertices of the tetrahedron be (0,0,0), (p, q, 0), (p, 0, r), (0, q, r). Then the

---------------

 edges between these points would be:

Between (0,0,0) and (p,q,0): sqrt(p² + q²),

Between (0,0,0) and (p,0,r): sqrt(p² + r²),

Between (0,0,0) and (0,q,r): sqrt(q² + r²),

Similarly

---------------

, the other edges would be the same as these because of the symmetry.

Wait, so in this case, the edges of

---------------

 the tetrahedron are exactly the three face diagonals. Therefore, if we set p, q, r such that sqrt(p² + q²)=sqrt(41), sqrt(p² + r²)=sqrt(80), sqrt(q² + r²)=sqrt(89), then this tetrahedron would have the

---------------

 required edge lengths. Therefore, the volume would be 1/3 of the box's volume. Wait, but what is the volume of the tetrahedron?

Let

---------------

 me compute the volume of this tetrahedron with vertices at (0,0,0), (p, q, 0), (p, 0, r), (0, q, r). To compute the volume, we

---------------

 can use the scalar triple product.

Let vectors from (0,0,0) be:

Vector AB = (p, q, 0)

Vector AC = (p, 0, r)

Vector AD = (0, q, r)

The volume is (1/6) * | (AB . (AC × AD)) |.

First compute the cross product AC × AD:

AC = (p, 0, r)

AD = (0, q, r)

Cross product:

|i  

---------------

 j   k |

|p   0   r |

|0   q   r |

= i*(0*r - r*q) - j*(p*r - r*0) + k*(p*q - 0*0)

= i*(-rq) - j*(pr) + k*(pq)

So,

---------------

 AC × AD = (-rq, -pr, pq)

Then, AB . (AC × AD) = (p, q, 0) . (-rq, -pr, pq)

= p*(-rq) + q*(-pr) + 0*(pq)

= -pqr - pqr + 0 = -2pqr

Therefore, the scalar triple product is -2pqr, so absolute value is 2pqr, and volume is (1/6)(2pqr) = (pqr)/3. So yes

---------------

, the volume of the tetrahedron is (p*q*r)/3. Therefore, if we can find p, q, r such that:



---------------

p² + q² = 41,

p² + r² = 80,

q² + r² = 89,

then the volume will

---------------

 be (p*q*r)/3, and we can compute p, q, r by solving these equations.

This seems promising.

---------------

 Let me try solving these equations for p², q², r².

Let me denote:

Equation 1: p² + q² = 41,

Equation 2: p² + r² = 80,

Equation 3: q² + r² = 89.

Let me subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2: (p² + r²) - (p² + q²) = 80 - 41 ⇒ r² - q² = 39.



---------------

Similarly, subtract Equation 2 from Equation 3: (q² + r²) - (p² + r²) = 89 - 80 ⇒ q² - p² = 9.

So now we have:

r² - q² = 39,

q² - p² = 9,

and we

---------------

 know p² + q² =41.

Let me write variables in terms of p², q², r².

Let me let

---------------

 x = p², y = q², z = r². Then:

Equation1: x + y =41,

Equation2: x + z =80,

Equation3: y + z =89,

Equ

---------------

ation4: z - y =39,

Equation5: y - x =9.

Wait, equations 4 and 5 are

---------------

 derived from the previous steps.

Alternatively, we can solve with equations 1, 2, 3.

Let me use

---------------

 equations 1,2,3.

We have three equations:

x + y =41,

x + z =80,

y + z =89.

Let me solve this system.

Sub

---------------

tract first equation from the second: z - y = 39.

Third equation is y + z =89.

So,

---------------

 let me set variables:

Let me call equation 2-1: z - y =39,

equation3: y + z =89.

Adding

---------------

 these two equations: (z - y) + (y + z) =39 +89 ⇒ 2z =128 ⇒ z=64.

Then,

---------------

 from equation3: y =89 - z =89 -64=25.

Then from equation1: x =41 - y=41-25=16.

Therefore, x =16, y=25, z=64.

Therefore, p²=16 ⇒ p=4,

q²=25 ⇒ q=5,

r²=64 ⇒ r=8.

Therefore, p=4, q=5, r=8.

Therefore, the volume of the tetrahedron is (p*q*r)/3 = (4*5*8)/3 = 160/3.

Wait, that

---------------

's a good result. So Volume V = 160/3.

Okay, so that's the volume. Now, I

---------------

 need to compute the total surface area of the tetrahedron to find the inradius.

The inradius is r = 3V / A, where A is the total surface area.

So I

---------------

 need to compute the areas of all four faces.

First, let's figure out the faces. The tetrahedron has four triangular faces: ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD.

Wait

---------------

, but given the edge lengths, perhaps each face is a triangle with sides from the given edges.

Wait, let me list all the edges for

---------------

 each face:

Face ABC: edges AB, BC, AC. Their lengths are AB=√41, BC=√89, AC=√80.

Face ABD: edges AB, BD, AD. AB=√41, BD=√80, AD=√89.

Face ACD: edges AC, CD, AD. AC=√80, CD=√41, AD=√89.

Face BCD: edges BC, CD, BD. BC=√89, CD=√41, BD=√80.

So each face has the same set of edge lengths: �

---------------

�41, √80, √89. Wait a second, so all four faces are congruent triangles?

Wait

---------------

, hold on, each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Let

---------------

 me check that:

Face ABC: AB= sqrt(41), BC= sqrt(89), AC= sqrt(80).

---------------

 So sides sqrt41, sqrt80, sqrt89.

Face ABD: AB= sqrt41, BD= sqrt80, AD= sqrt89. Same set

---------------

.

Similarly, ACD: AC= sqrt80, CD= sqrt41, AD= sqrt89. Same.

BCD: BC= sqrt89, CD= sqrt41, BD= sqrt80. Same.

Therefore, all four faces are congruent triangles with sides sqrt41, sqrt80, sqrt89. Therefore, each face has the same area. Therefore

---------------

, the total surface area A is 4 times the area of one face.

Therefore, if I can compute the area of one face, multiply by 4, and then compute r

---------------

 = 3*(160/3) / (4*area) = (160) / (4*area) = 40 / area.

Wait

---------------

, let me check:

Wait, formula is r = 3V / A_total. So Volume V =160/3,

---------------

 so 3V is 160. Then divided by A_total gives 160 / A_total. Since A_total =4*A_face, then r

---------------

 = 160/(4*A_face) =40/A_face. So yes.

Therefore, need to compute the area of one face.

---------------

 Let's compute the area of triangle with sides sqrt41, sqrt80, sqrt89.

Let me denote the sides as a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89). Let me use Heron's formula. First compute the semi-perimeter:

s = (a + b + c)/2 =

---------------

 (sqrt41 + sqrt80 + sqrt89)/2.

Hmm, this might get messy with square roots. Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 there's a better way.

Alternatively, notice that the sides squared are 41, 80, 89. Let me see if these

---------------

 form a right triangle?

Check if 41 + 80 = 121, which is 11², but 89 is not 121. Wait

---------------

, 41 + 80 = 121, which is 11², but 89 is less. Wait

---------------

, 41 + 80 = 121, so sqrt(41)^2 + sqrt(80)^2 = 41 +80 =121=

---------------

11², but the third side squared is 89, which is less than 121, so it

---------------

's an acute triangle? Wait, no, 89 is the largest side here? Wait, sqrt(89) is the

---------------

 largest side (since 89 is the largest among 41,80,89). Let me check:



---------------

Wait, 41 + 80 = 121, which is greater than 89, so by the law

---------------

 of cosines:

c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(theta), where theta is the angle opposite side c.

Here

---------------

, c is sqrt(89), so c² =89, a² + b² =41+80=121.

---------------

 So:

89 =121 - 2ab cos(theta),

so 2ab cos(theta)=121 -89 =32,

so

---------------

 cos(theta)=32/(2ab)=16/(ab).

Hmm, but maybe using Heron's formula is the

---------------

 way to go, even if it's a bit messy.

Alternatively, note that since the triangle has sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), then

---------------

 perhaps the area can be calculated as (1/2)*base*height, but without knowing angles, that might not help.

Alternatively, since

---------------

 we know p, q, r from the box, maybe the area can be related to that?

Wait, the triangles are the faces of the tetrahedron,

---------------

 which are the face diagonals of the box. Wait, in the box with edges 4,5,8, the

---------------

 face diagonals are sqrt(4²+5²)=sqrt(41), sqrt(4²+8²)=sqrt(80), sqrt(5²+8²)=sqrt(89). So each face of the tetrahedron is a triangle with

---------------

 sides equal to three face diagonals of the box, which are the edges of the tetrahedron.

Therefore, each face is a triangle lying on a face

---------------

 of the box? Wait, no. Wait, actually, each face of the tetrahedron is not on the box's face,

---------------

 but the edges are the face diagonals.

Alternatively, maybe the area of each triangular face can be found using the coordinates.

---------------

 Let me pick one face, say triangle ABC, and compute its area using coordinates.

Earlier, we had coordinates for the tetrahedron in

---------------

 the box. Let me recall the coordinates. If the box is with edges p=4, q=5, r=8, then the coordinates

---------------

 of the tetrahedron vertices would be:

A = (0,0,0),

B = (4,5,0),

C = (4,0,8),

D = (0,5,8).

Wait, let me confirm that

---------------

.

Wait, in the earlier setup, the four vertices of the tetrahedron in the box were (0,0,0), (p,q,0), (p,0,r), (0,q,r). So with

---------------

 p=4, q=5, r=8:

A=(0,0,0),

B=(4,5,0),

C=(4,0,8),

D=(0,5,8).

Yes

---------------

. Let's confirm the distances:

AB: from (0,0,0) to (4,5,0): sqrt(16 +25 +0)=sqrt(41).

---------------

 Good.

AC: from (0,0,0) to (4,0,8): sqrt(16 +0 +64)=sqrt(80). Good.

AD: from (0,0,0) to (0,5,8): sqrt(0 +25 +64)=sqrt(89). Good.

BC: from (4,5,0) to (4,0,8): sqrt(0 +25 +64)=sqrt(89). Good.

BD: from (4,5,0) to (0,5,8): sqrt(16 +0 +64)=sqrt(80). Good.

CD: from (4,0,8) to (0,5,8): sqrt(16 +25 +0)=sqrt(41). Perfect.

Okay

---------------

, so those coordinates are correct. Therefore, the coordinates are set. Now, let's compute the area of triangle ABC,

---------------

 for instance.

Points A=(0,0,0), B=(4,5,0), C=(4,0,8).

First

---------------

, compute vectors AB and AC.

Vector AB = B - A = (4,5,0)

Vector AC = C - A = (4,0,8)

The cross product AB × AC will give a vector perpendicular to the plane, whose magnitude is equal to the area of the parallelogram, so half of that is the area of the triangle.

Compute the cross product:

AB × AC = |i   j   k|

           

---------------

 4   5   0

            4   0   8

= i*(5*8 - 0*0) - j*(4*8 - 0*4) + k*(4*0 -5*4)

= i*(40) - j*(32) + k*(-20)

So the cross product is (40, -32, -20)

The magnitude of this vector is sqrt(40² + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2)

---------------

 = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(1600+1024=2624; 2624+400=3024)



---------------

sqrt(3024). Let's factor that:

3024 divided by 16 is 189, so sqrt(16*189)=4*sqrt(189). Then 189=

---------------

9*21=9*3*7, so sqrt(9*21)=3*sqrt(21). So

---------------

 sqrt(189)=3*sqrt(21). Thus sqrt(3024)=4*3*sqrt(21)=12*sqrt(21). Therefore, the magnitude is 12√21.

Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is half that, so 6√21.

Therefore, each face has area 6√21. Therefore, total surface area A_total =4 *6√21 =24√21.

Therefore, the inradius r = 3V / A_total = 3*(160/3) / (24√21) = (160) / (24√21) = simpl

---------------

ifying numerator and denominator:

Divide numerator and denominator by 8: 160/8=20, 24/8=3.

---------------

 So 20/(3√21).

But we need to rationalize the denominator:

20/(3√21) = (20√21)/(3*21) = (20√21)/63. But

---------------

 wait, 20 and 63 are both divisible by... 20 and 63 have GCD 1. So the

---------------

 simplified form is (20√21)/63.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again:

Wait, 

---------------

3V is 3*(160/3)=160, and A_total is 24√21. So 160 divided by 24√21.

---------------

 Simplify 160/24: 160 divided by 8 is 20, 24 divided by 8 is 3, so 20/3. So 

---------------

20/(3√21). Then rationalizing:

Multiply numerator and denominator by √21:

(20√21)/(3*21) = (20√21)/63. Since

---------------

 20 and 63 are coprime (factors of 20 are 2,5; 63 is 7,3, so no common factors), and 21 is 3*7, which is square-free. Therefore, the expression

---------------

 is (20√21)/63. So m=20, n=21, p=63. Then

---------------

 m + n + p =20+21+63=104.

Wait, but before I conclude

---------------

, let me double-check all steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, the volume calculation via Cayley-Menger determinant vs

---------------

. the box method. The box method gave us 160/3, but let me confirm via Cayley-Menger determinant

---------------

. Wait, maybe that's a good idea to check.

Alternatively, since I already used the box method and found p=

---------------

4, q=5, r=8, and that gives volume 4*5*8 /3 = 160/3, which

---------------

 is correct, so that seems okay.

Then the coordinates were set up correctly, and the cross product for area of ABC gave

---------------

 6√21. Let me confirm that cross product step again.

Vectors AB=(4,5,0), AC=(4,0,8). Cross product components

---------------

:

i component: 5*8 -0*0 =40

j component: -(4*8 -0*4)= -32

k component:4*0 -5*4= -20

So

---------------

 cross product is (40, -32, -20). The magnitude squared is 40² + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2 = 1600 + 1024 +400 =

---------------

 3024, sqrt(3024). Let me compute sqrt(3024):

3024 divided by 144 is 21, because

---------------

 144*21=3024. Therefore sqrt(144*21)=12√21. Therefore

---------------

 the magnitude is 12√21, so area is 6√21. That checks out.

Total surface area 

---------------

4*6√21 =24√21, correct.

Volume is 160/3, so inradius is 3*(160/3)/24√21 =160/(24√21)=20/(3√21)=20√21/63. So

---------------

 m=20, n=21, p=63. 20+21+63=104. 



---------------

Wait, but the problem says "the distance can be written in the form m√n / p, where m and p are coprime, and n is square-free."

---------------

 So 20 and 63 are coprime (since 20 factors into 2²×5, 63 is 3²×7; no common primes). And 21 is 3×7, which is square-free. So yes, that's

---------------

 the correct form. So the answer is 20+21+63=104. 

Therefore, I think that's the correct answer. Let

---------------

 me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make calculation errors.

All

**Final Answer**
\boxed{104}


Given a tetrahedron \(ABCD\) with edge lengths \(AB = CD = \sqrt{41}\), \(AC = BD = \sqrt{80}\), and \(BC = AD = \sqrt{89}\), we need to find the inradius and

---------------

 express it in the form \(\frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p}\), then compute \(m + n + p\).

1. **Identify the Tetrahedron as a Disphenoid**:
   - The tetrahedron is a disphenoid with opposite edges equal. This allows us to model it in a rectangular box with edges \(p\), \(q\), and \(r\) such that the face diagonals correspond to the tet

---------------

rahedron's edges.

2. **Solve for \(p\), \(q\), and \(r\)**:
   - Set up equations for the face diagonals:
     \[
     \begin{aligned}
     p^2 + q^2 &= 41, \\
     p^2 + r^2 &= 80, \\
     q^2 + r^2 &= 89.
     \end{aligned}
     \]
   - Solving these, we find \(p = 4\), \(q = 5\), and \(r = 8\).

3. **Calculate the Volume**:
   - The volume \(V\) of the tetrahedron is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the volume of the box:
     \[
     V = \frac{1}{3} \times p \times q \times r = \frac{1}{3} \times 4 \times 5 \times 8 = \frac{160}{3}.
     \]

4. **Calculate the Surface Area**:
   - Each face of the tetrahedron is a triangle with sides \(\sqrt{41}\), \(\sqrt{80}\), and \(\sqrt{89}\). Using coordinates and

---------------

 the cross product, the area of one face is found to be \(6\sqrt{21}\).
   - Total surface area \(A\) is \(4 \times 6\sqrt{21} = 24\sqrt{21}\).

5. **Compute the Inradius**:
   - The inradius \(r\) is given by \(r = \frac{3V}{A}\):
     \[
     r = \frac{3 \times \frac{160}{3}}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{160}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{20}{3\sqrt{21}} = \frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63}.
     \]
   - This simplifies to \(\frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63}\), where \(m = 20\), \(n = 21\), and \(p = 63\).

6. **Final Result**:
   - Summing these values gives \(20 + 21 + 63 = 104\).

\[
\boxed{104}
