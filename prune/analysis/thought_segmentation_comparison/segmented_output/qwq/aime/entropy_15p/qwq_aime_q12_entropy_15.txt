Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem about Aya's walking and coffee shop stops. Hmm, so the problem says

---------------

 that Aya walks 9 kilometers each morning and then stops at a coffee shop. The time she takes includes both walking and the time spent in the coffee shop, which is t minutes. There are two scenarios given here: one where she walks at speed s and takes 4 hours total, and another where she walks faster, at s+2 km/h, and takes 2 hours and 24 minutes. Then, they want to know how long it would take if she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including the same t minutes. Alright, let me break

---------------

 this down.

First, I need to set up equations based on the information given. Let me recall that time equals distance divided by speed. But here, the total time includes both walking time and the coffee shop time. Since

---------------

 the coffee shop time t is the same in both scenarios, I can write equations for each case where total time equals walking time plus t.



---------------

Let me note down the given data:

Case 1:
- Walking speed: s km/h
- Total time: 4 hours (

---------------

which is 240 minutes, but maybe better to keep in hours for now)
- Walking time: (9 km) / (s km/h)
- Total time:

---------------

 walking time + (t/60) hours = 4 hours. Wait, actually, t is given in minutes, so maybe

---------------

 I need to convert that into hours or convert everything into minutes. Hmm, perhaps better to work in hours to keep the units consistent with

---------------

 speed being km per hour.

Wait, let's see. Let me think carefully.

The total time in the first case is 4 hours, which includes t minutes in the coffee shop. So, the walking

---------------

 time plus the coffee time (in hours) equals 4 hours. But t is in minutes, so maybe I need to convert t to hours.

---------------

 Alternatively, convert everything to minutes. Let me see which is easier.

Let me try using hours for everything. Let me denote

---------------

 t in minutes as t minutes, so in hours that would be t/60. So, for case 1:

Walking time (in hours) + t/60 (coffee time in hours) = 4 hours.

Similarly, for

---------------

 case 2:

Walking time at speed s+2: 9/(s+2) hours, plus t/60 hours equals 2 hours and 24 minutes. Wait

---------------

, 2 hours 24 minutes is 2.4 hours, right? Because 24 minutes is 0.4 hours (since 24/60 = 0.4). Alternatively

---------------

, 2 hours 24 minutes is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours. So,

---------------

 the equation would be:

9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

So, in

---------------

 both cases, we can write equations with variables s and t. Then, we can solve for s and t first, and then compute the time when she

---------------

 walks at s + 1/2 km/h.

Let me write the equations again more precisely.

Case 1:

9

---------------

/s + t/60 = 4

Case 2:

9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

So,

---------------

 these are two equations with two variables, s and t. We can solve these equations to find s and t first.

Let me subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate t. Wait, actually, maybe

---------------

 subtract one equation from the other. Let me see:

Let me denote equation 1: 9/s + t/60 = 4

Equation 2: 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

If I subtract equation 2 from equation 1, the t/60 terms will cancel out,

---------------

 and we can solve for s.

So:

[9/s - 9/(s + 2)] + [t/60 - t/60] = 4 - 2.4

S

---------------

implify:

9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

So, 9*(1/s - 1/(s + 2)) = 1.6

Let me compute 1/s - 1/(s + 2):

That's ( (s + 2) - s ) / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)]

So, substituting back:

9*(2 /

---------------

 [s(s + 2)]) = 1.6

So, 18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6

Then

---------------

, solving for s(s + 2):

s(s + 2) = 18 / 1.6

Compute

---------------

 18 divided by 1.6. Let me calculate that:

1.6 is 8/5, so 18 divided by (8/5) is 18*(5/8) = (90)/8 = 11.25

So

---------------

, s(s + 2) = 11.25

So, this is a quadratic equation:

s² + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Hmm, let

---------------

 me write that as s² + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Let me solve this quadratic equation for

---------------

 s. Using the quadratic formula:

s = [ -2 ± sqrt( (2)^2 - 4*1*(-11.25) ) ] / (2*1)

Compute discriminant:

4 + 45 = 49.

---------------

 Wait, 4*1*11.25 is 45? Let me check:

Yes, 4 * 11.25 is 45. So,

---------------

 discriminant is 4 + 45 = 49. So sqrt(49) is 7.

Thus,

s = [ -2 ± 7 ] / 2

We can discard the negative solution because speed can't be negative. So,

s = ( -2 + 7 ) / 2 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h

Wait, that

---------------

 seems slow for walking. 2.5 km/h? That's like a slow walk. Hmm, maybe that's okay.

---------------

 Let me check the calculations again to be sure.

Wait, let's retrace the steps:

Starting with equations:

9/s + t/60 = 4



---------------

9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

Subtracting the second equation from the first gives:

9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

Yes

---------------

. Then, factoring the 9:

9*(1/s - 1/(s + 2)) = 1.6

Then, 1/s - 1/(s + 2) is 

---------------

2/[s(s + 2)]

So, 9*(2)/[s(s + 2)] = 1.6 →

---------------

 18/[s(s + 2)] = 1.6 → s(s + 2) = 18/1.6 = 11.25



---------------

So, quadratic equation s² + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Solutions: s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)] / 2 = [-2 ±7]/2.

---------------

 So positive solution is (5)/2 = 2.5 km/h. Hmm, okay. Maybe that's correct. Let me see

---------------

 if that works.

Let me check with s = 2.5 km/h.

First case: walking time is 9 / 2.5 = 3.6 hours. Then

---------------

 total time is 3.6 + t/60 = 4 hours. Therefore, t/60 = 0.4 hours → t = 0.4*60 = 24 minutes.

Second

---------------

 case: walking speed s + 2 = 4.5 km/h. Walking time is 9 / 4.5 = 2 hours. Then total time is 2 + t/60 = 2 + 24/60 = 2 + 0.4 = 2.4 hours, which is 2 hours 24 minutes. That matches the given data

---------------

. So that's correct. Okay, so s is indeed 2.5 km/h, and t is 24 minutes.

So

---------------

 now, the question is, if she walks at s + 1/2 km/h. Since s is 2.5, adding

---------------

 0.5 gives 3 km/h. So her speed is 3 km/h. Then, the walking time would be 9 / 3 = 3 hours. Then total time is walking time plus t minutes (

---------------

24 minutes). Wait, but need to convert everything into same units. Let me check:

Walking time at 3 km/h is 9 / 3 = 3 hours. Then,

---------------

 adding the coffee shop time of 24 minutes. So total time is 3 hours + 24 minutes. Con

---------------

verting 3 hours to minutes is 180 minutes, so total time is 180 +24 = 204 minutes. Alternatively

---------------

, if expressed in hours, it would be 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 hours, but the question asks for the number of minutes. So 204 minutes.

Wait, but

---------------

 let me confirm again. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistake here.

Wait, so s is 2.5, so s + 1/2 is 3, correct

---------------

. So walking time is 9 / 3 = 3 hours. Then, adding t minutes, which we found was

---------------

 24 minutes. So total time is 3 hours and 24 minutes, which is indeed 204 minutes. That

---------------

 seems straightforward.

Hmm, but let me check again the t value. When s was 2.5, t was 24 minutes. Let

---------------

 me confirm that with the first equation. The first equation: 9 / 2.5 = 3.6 hours.

---------------

 Then 3.6 + (24/60) = 3.6 + 0.4 = 4.0 hours. Correct. Similarly

---------------

 for the second case, 9/(2.5 +2) = 9/4.5 = 2 hours, plus 24 minutes is

---------------

 2.4 hours. Perfect.

So, everything checks out. Therefore, when she walks at 3 km/h, the

---------------

 total time is 3 hours and 24 minutes, which is 204 minutes. So the answer should be 204.

---------------

 Let me just make sure there's no trick here, like maybe the t is supposed to be in the middle? Wait, no

---------------

, the problem says "the walk takes her... including t minutes spent in the coffee shop". So the total time includes both the walking and the stop. So when

---------------

 she walks faster, the walking time is less, but the t remains the same. So yes, the total time is walking time plus t.

---------------

 So in the third scenario, walking at 3 km/h, it's 3 hours walking plus 24 minutes,

---------------

 so total 204 minutes. So I think that's the answer. Let me just re-express all steps once

---------------

 again to be thorough.

First, equations:

1) 9/s + t/60 = 4

2) 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

Subtract equation

---------------

 2 from 1:

9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6

Solving gives

---------------

 s = 2.5, then substituting back gives t =24. Then, at s + 0.5 = 3, walking time is 3 hours, so

---------------

 total time is 3*60 +24= 204. Yep, that's solid. I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{204}


Given that Aya walks 9 kilometers at a speed of \( s \) km/h and takes 4 hours including \( t \) minutes in the coffee shop, and at \( s + 2 \) km/h she takes 2 hours and 24 minutes (which is 2.4 hours) including the same \( t \) minutes, we need to find the total time when she walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/h.

First, we set up the equations for the given scenarios:

1. For speed \( s \) km/h:
   \[
   \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
   \]

2. For speed \( s + 2 \) km/h:
   \[
   \frac{9}{s + 2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4
   \]

Subtracting the second equation from the first to eliminate \( t \):
\[
\frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s + 2} = 1.6
\]

Simplifying:
\[
9 \left( \frac{1}{s} - \frac{1}{s + 2} \right) = 1.6
\]
\[
9 \left( \frac{2}{s(s + 2)} \right) = 1.6
\]
\[
\frac{18}{s(s + 2)} = 1.6
\]
\[
s(s + 2) = \frac{18}{1.6} = 11.25
\]

Solving the quadratic equation \( s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula:
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 45}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 7}{2}
\]
Taking the positive root:
\[
s = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \text{ km/h}
\]

Substituting \( s = 2.5 \) back into the first equation to find \( t \):
\[
\frac{9}{2.5} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
\[
3.6 + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
\[
\frac{t}{60} = 0.4 \implies t = 24 \text{ minutes}
\]

For the speed \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h:
- Walking time: \( \frac{9}{3} = 3 \) hours
- Total time: \( 3 \) hours + 24 minutes = \( 180 + 24 = 204 \) minutes

Thus, the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the \( t \) minutes spent in the coffee shop, is \(\boxed{204}\).<|im_end|>
