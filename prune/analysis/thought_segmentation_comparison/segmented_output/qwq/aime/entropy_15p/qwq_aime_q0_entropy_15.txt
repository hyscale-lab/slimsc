Okay, so I have this problem with three equations involving logarithms, and I need to find the absolute value of another logarithm expression,

---------------

 then express it as a fraction m/n and find m + n. Let me see how to approach this.

First, the equations are all logarithmic with base 2. The variables are x, y, z, all positive real numbers. The equations are:

1. log₂(x/(yz)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(xz)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(xy)) = 1/4

Hmm. Since

---------------

 they are all logs base 2, maybe I can convert these equations into exponential form to make them easier to handle. Let me try that.

Starting with the first equation:

log₂(x/(yz)) = 1/2 implies that x/(yz) = 2^(1/2). So x = yz * 2^(1/2). Let me write that down:

Equation 1: x = y z * 2^(1/2)

Similarly, the second equation:

log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3 implies

---------------

 y/(x z) = 2^(1/3). Therefore, y = x z * 2^(1/3)

Equation 2: y = x z * 2^(1/3)

Third equation:

log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4 implies z/(x y) = 2^(1/4). So z = x y * 2^(1/4)

Equation 3: z = x y * 2^(1/4)

Hmm, so now I have three equations with

---------------

 x, y, z in terms of each other. This looks a bit circular. Maybe I can substitute them into each other to

---------------

 find expressions for x, y, z in terms of a single variable?

Alternatively, maybe express all variables in terms of one variable.

---------------

 Let me see. Let me try substituting equation 1 into equation 2, or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 I can take the logarithms and express them as equations in terms of log x, log y, log z. That might be a

---------------

 better approach. Let me try that.

Let me denote:

Let a = log₂x, b = log₂y, c = log₂z. Then, since log₂(x/(yz)) = 1/2,

log₂x - log₂(yz) = 1/2

Which is log₂x - (log₂y + log₂z) = 1/2,

---------------

 so a - (b + c) = 1/2.

Similarly for the other equations:

Second equation: log₂(y/(xz)) = 1/3



---------------

So log₂y - (log₂x + log₂z) = 1/3, so b - (a + c) = 1/3

Third equation: log₂(z/(xy)) = 1/4

log

---------------

₂z - (log₂x + log₂y) = 1/4, so c - (a + b) = 1/4

So now,

---------------

 I have a system of three linear equations in variables a, b, c.

The equations are:

1) a - b - c = 1/2

2) -a + b - c = 1/3

3) -a - b + c = 1/4

Hmm, this

---------------

 seems more manageable. Let me write them down again:

Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2

Equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3

Equation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4

So

---------------

 now, I need to solve this system for a, b, c. Once I have a, b, c, then log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) would be 4a + 3b + 2c. Then take absolute value and express

---------------

 as a fraction.

Alright, let me try to solve this system.

First, let me write all three equations:

1) a - b - c = 1/2

2) -a + b - c = 1/3

3) -a - b + c = 1/4

Hmm. Let me see if I can add equations to eliminate variables. Let me try adding equations 1 and 2 first.

Adding equation 1 and 2:

(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) = 1/2 + 1/3

Left side: (a -a) + (-b + b) + (-c - c) = 0 + 0 -2c = -2c

Right side: (3/6 + 2/6) = 5/6

Therefore: -2c = 5/6 ⇒

---------------

 c = -5/12

Hmm, so c is -5/12. Let me note that down: c = -5/12.

Now, let's add equations 1 and 3:

Equation1 + Equation3:

(a - b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/2 + 1/4

Left side: (a -a) + (-b - b) + (-c + c) = 0 -2b + 0 = -2b

Right side: 3/4

Thus

---------------

: -2b = 3/4 ⇒ b = -3/8

Wait, so b = -3/8?



---------------

Wait, let me check that again.

Wait equation1 + equation3:

Left side: a - b -c -a - b + c = (a -a) + (-b - b) + (-c + c) = 0 -2b + 0 = -2b

Right side: 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4.

---------------

 So yes, -2b = 3/4 ⇒ b = -3/8. Okay, so b is -3/8.

Similarly, let's add equations 2 and 3:

Equation2 + Equation3:

(-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/3 + 1/4

Left side: (-a -a) + (b - b) + (-c + c) = -2a + 0 + 0 = -2a

Right side: (4/12 + 3/12) = 7/12

Thus

---------------

: -2a = 7/12 ⇒ a = -7/24

Wait, so a = -7/24?



---------------

Hmm. Let me check that again.

Left side: -a + b -c -a -b + c = (-a -a) + (b - b) + (-c + c) = -2a,

---------------

 yes.

Right side: 1/3 + 1/4 is indeed 7/12. So -2a =7/12 ⇒ a = -7/24. Okay

---------------

.

So, so far, we have:

a = -7/24,

b = -3/8,

c = -5/12.

Wait, but let me check

---------------

 if these values satisfy all three equations.

Let me plug into equation1:

a - b - c = (-7/24) - (-3/8) - (-5/12) = (-7/24) + 3/8 + 5/12

Convert to 24 denominators:

-7/24 + 9/24 + 10/24 = (-7 +9 +10)/24 = 12/24 = 1/2. Okay

---------------

, that's correct.

Equation2: -a + b -c = -(-7/24) + (-3/8) - (-5/12) = 7/24 - 3/8 +5/12

Convert to 24 denomin

---------------

ators:

7/24 - 9/24 +10/24 = (7 -9 +10)/24 = 8/24 = 1/3. Correct.

Equation3: -a -b +c = -(-7/24) - (-3/8) + (-5/12) = 7/24 + 3/8 -5/12

Convert to 24 denominators:

7/24 +9/24 -10/24 = (7 +9 -10)/24 =6/24 =1/4. Correct. Okay

---------------

, so the values are correct.

Therefore, a = log₂x = -7/24,

b = log₂y = -3/8,

c = log₂z = -5/12.

Now, we need to compute log₂(x⁴ y³ z²). Let me compute that expression.

log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = 4 log₂x + 3 log₂y + 2 log₂z = 4a + 3b + 2c.

Plugging in the values:

4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12)

Let me compute each term:

4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = -7/6,

3*(-3/8) = -9/8,

2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6.

Adding

---------------

 them together:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6.

First, let's convert all to 24 denominators:

-7/6 = -28/24,

-9/8 = -27/24,

-5/6 = -20/24.

Total: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24.

Hmm

---------------

, so log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = -75/24.

The problem asks for the absolute value of this, so | -75/24 | = 75/24.

S

---------------

implify this fraction: 75 and 24 have a common divisor of 3. 75 ÷3=25, 24 ÷3=8. So 25/8. 

---------------

25 and 8 are coprime. So m=25, n=8, so m +n = 33.

Wait, hold

---------------

 on, let me check the arithmetic again because I might have messed up.

Wait, let's re-calculate 4a + 3b + 2c:



---------------

4a = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6,

3b = 3*(-3/8) = -9/8,

2c = 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6.

Adding

---------------

 those together:

First, add -7/6 and -5/6: that's (-7 -5)/6 = -12/6 = -2.

Then add -9/8 to that: -2 -9/8 = - (16/8 +9/8) = -25/8. Wait, wait

---------------

 a second! Wait, hold on.

Wait, -7/6 -9/8 -5/6. Let me do

---------------

 it step by step:

First, group the terms with denominator 6:

-7/6 -5/6 = (-7 -5)/6 = -12/6 = -2.

Then,

---------------

 the remaining term is -9/8. So total is -2 -9/8.

Convert -2 to eighths: -16/8 -9/8 = -25/8. So

---------------

 the total is -25/8. Therefore, the absolute value is 25/8. So that's 25/8, so m is 25, n is 8. They

---------------

 are coprime since 25 is 5² and 8 is 2³. So m +n = 33.

Wait, so my

---------------

 first calculation was wrong because I converted to 24ths incorrectly. Let me check that again.

Wait, 4a +

---------------

3b +2c:

4a = -28/24,

3b = -9/8 = -27/24,

2c = -10/12 = -20/24,

Adding

---------------

 all together:

-28/24 -27/24 -20/24 = (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24.

---------------

 Wait, but that contradicts the previous result of -25/8. Wait, but -75/24 simplifies to -25/8,

---------------

 because 75 divided by 3 is 25, 24 divided by 3 is 8. So yes

---------------

, -75/24 = -25/8. So absolute value is 25/8. So that

---------------

 is correct. So my first calculation was right, but the second way also gives same result. So the answer is 25/8, so m +n is 33.

Therefore

---------------

, the final answer is 33. But let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations here.

Wait, let

---------------

 me double-check all steps again.

Starting from the equations:

We had a = log₂x = -7/24,

log₂y = b = -3/8,

log₂z = c = -5/12.

Therefore

---------------

, log₂(x⁴y³z²) = 4a +3b +2c.

Compute each term:

4a = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6,

3b = 3*(-3/8) = -9/8,

2c = 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6,

Adding

---------------

 them:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6.

First, combine the terms with denominator 6:

-7/6 -5/6 = (-12)/6 = -2,

Then subtract

---------------

 9/8:

-2 - 9/8 = -(16/8 +9/8) = -25/8. Absolute

---------------

 value is 25/8. So yes, that's correct.

Therefore, m =25, n=8, which are coprime. So

---------------

 m +n = 33. So the answer is 33. Okay, that seems solid.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{33}


Given the system of equations involving logarithms:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}, \quad \log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

we convert these equations into linear equations by setting \(a = \log_2 x\), \(b = \log_2 y\), and \(c = \log_2 z\). This gives us the following system:

1. \(a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(-a + b - c = \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(-a - b + c = \frac{1}{4}\)

We solve this system step-by-step:

1. Adding equations 1 and 2:
   \[
   (a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} \implies -2c = \frac{5}{6} \implies c = -\frac{5}{12}
   \]

2. Adding equations 1 and 3:
   \[
   (a - b - c) + (-a - b + c) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} \implies -2b = \frac{3}{4} \implies b = -\frac{3}{8}
   \]

3. Adding equations 2 and 3:
   \[
   (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} \implies -2a = \frac{7}{12} \implies a = -\frac{7}{24}
   \]

Thus, we have \(a = -\frac{7}{24}\), \(b = -\frac{3}{8}\), and \(c = -\frac{5}{12}\).

Next, we compute \(\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\):

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4a + 3b + 2c
\]

Substituting the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):

\[
4\left(-\frac{7}{24}\right) + 3\left(-\frac{3}{8}\right) + 2\left(-\frac{5}{12}\right)
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
4\left(-\frac{7}{24}\right) = -\frac{28}{24} = -\frac{7}{6}, \quad 3\left(-\frac{3}{8}\right) = -\frac{9}{8}, \quad 2\left(-\frac{5}{12}\right) = -\frac{10}{12} = -\frac{5}{6}
\]

Summing these terms:

\[
-\frac{7}{6} - \frac{9}{8} - \frac{5}{6} = -\left(\frac{28}{24} + \frac{27}{24} + \frac{20}{24}\right) = -\frac{75}{24} = -\frac{25}{8}
\]

Taking the absolute value:

\[
\left| -\frac{25}{8} \right| = \frac{25}{8}
\]

Thus, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), giving

---------------

 \(m + n = 25 + 8 = 33\).

\[
\boxed{33}
