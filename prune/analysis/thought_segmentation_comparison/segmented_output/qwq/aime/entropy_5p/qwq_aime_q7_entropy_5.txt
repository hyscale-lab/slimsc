Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. We need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

Hmm, that

---------------

's a bit intimidating, but let's break it down step by step.

First, let's recall that the problem involves symmetric expressions in a, b, and c. The first equation is straightforward—it's the sum of the three variables. The second equation is a bit more complex; it's the sum of all possible terms where two variables are squared and multiplied by the third. Since

---------------

 the equation is symmetric, maybe there's a way to simplify it using some algebraic identities.

Let me think about the second equation. Let's denote S = a + b + c. We know S = 300 here. Maybe we can express the second equation in terms of S and other symmetric sums?

The second equation is:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

I notice that each term is of the form (variable squared) times (another variable). Let me see if I can factor this expression or relate it to known symmetric sums.

Another

---------------

 thought: perhaps we can factor this expression. Let me try grouping terms:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So the entire expression becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Hmm, that's a bit

---------------

 better. Since we know that a + b + c = 300, then b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c. Let's substitute these into the expression:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c)

So the equation becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Hmm, that's a good

---------------

 simplification. Let me write that down:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Now

---------------

, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers adding up to 300, each of them is between 0 and 300. Maybe

---------------

 there's a way to express this equation in terms of S and other known terms?

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider substituting variables. Let me think if

---------------

 there's a substitution that can make this easier.

Alternatively, maybe consider that since the equation is symmetric, perhaps the solutions have some symmetry themselves

---------------

. For example, maybe two variables are equal, or all three are equal? Let's check if all three variables equal could

---------------

 be a solution.

If a = b = c, then each would be 100, since 3*100 = 300. Let's check the second equation:

Each term would be 100²*100 + 100²*100 + ... Wait, no, hold on. Wait, actually

---------------

, each term in the original expression is of the form a²b, so if all variables are 100, then each term would be 100²*100. There are six terms, so total would be 6*(100^3). But 100^3 is 1,000,000, so 6*1,000,000 is 6,000,000. Oh! That's exactly the value given in the problem. So (100, 100, 100) is a solution.

So that's one solution. But the problem is asking for all triples, so there might be more. Let

---------------

's see.

Since the problem is symmetric, perhaps all permutations of some triples where two variables are equal, or maybe other configurations

---------------

?

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let's consider expanding the expression or trying to relate it to (a + b + c)^3 or something like that.

Wait, let's recall that:

(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b) + 6abc.

Hmm, that's a standard identity. Let me verify that:

Yes, (a + b + c)^3 expands to:

a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3a²b + 3a²c + 3b²a + 3b²c + 3c²a + 3c²b + 6abc.

So, rearranged:

(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3*(a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b) + 6abc.

Therefore, the

---------------

 term we have in the problem, which is a²b + a²c + ... + c²a, is equal to [ (a + b + c)^3 - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) - 6abc ] / 3.

But

---------------

 since we know a + b + c = 300, perhaps this identity can help us?

Given that, let's denote:

Let me write down the identity again:

Let

---------------

 S = a + b + c = 300.

Then,

S^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3*(expression) + 6abc,

so,

expression = [S^3 - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) - 6abc]/3.

We know the expression is given as 6,000,000. Let me plug in S = 300:

So,

6,000,000 = [300^3 - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) - 6abc]/3.

Multiply both sides by 3:

18,000,000 = 300^3 - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) - 6abc.

Compute 300^3: 300*300*300 = 27,000,000.

Therefore:

18,000,000 = 27,000,000 - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) - 6abc

Rearranged:

(a^3 + b^3 + c^3) + 6abc = 27,000,000 - 18,000,000 = 9,000,000.

So,

a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 6abc = 9,000,000.

Hmm, interesting

---------------

. Now, perhaps we can find a relationship here?

Alternatively, perhaps we can use another identity. There's an identity that relates a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca).

But here, we have a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 6abc. Hmm. Let me see.

Alternatively, let's consider

---------------

 that:

a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 6abc = ?

Hmm, perhaps we can relate

---------------

 this to (a + b + c)^3 somehow?

Wait, we already used that. Alternatively, perhaps factor differently?

Alternatively, perhaps let

---------------

 me think of the equation:

a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 6abc = 9,000,000.

Hmm

---------------

, but maybe this is a bit too abstract. Let's see if we can find another equation involving a, b, c.

We know that a + b + c = 300. Let me also consider

---------------

 the sum of squares or products.

Alternatively, maybe let's consider variables in terms of two variables. Since a + b + c = 300, we can set c = 300 - a - b, and then express everything in terms of a and b. But this might get complicated, but perhaps manageable?

Alternatively, maybe let

---------------

's think of the case where two variables are equal, since the problem is symmetric. Let me try that approach first, as the

---------------

 solution (100,100,100) is symmetric.

Suppose two variables are equal, say a = b. Then c = 300 - 2a.

Then, let's plug into the second equation.

First, compute

---------------

 the expression a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Since a = b,

= a²a + a²c + a²a + a²c + c²a + c²a

= 2a³ + 2a²c + 2a c²

=

---------------

 2a³ + 2a²c + 2a c²

Factor 2a:

= 2a(a² + a c + c²)

But c = 300 - 2a, so substituting:

= 2a [a² + a(300 - 2a) + (300 - 2a)^2 ]

Let me compute that

---------------

 step by step.

First, compute the terms inside the brackets:

a² + a(300 - 2a) + (300 - 2a)^2

First term: a²

Second term: 300a - 2a²

Third term: Let's expand (300 - 2a)^2 = 300² - 4*300a + 4a² = 90,000 - 1200a + 4a²

So adding all three terms:

a² + (300a - 2a²) + (90,000 - 1200a + 4a²)

Combine like terms:

a² - 2a² + 4a² = 3a²

300a - 1200a = -900a

And

---------------

 the constant term 90,000.

Therefore, total inside the brackets is 3a² - 900a + 90,000.

Therefore, the entire expression becomes:

2a*(3a² - 900a + 90,000) = 6a³ - 1800a² + 180,000a

We know this equals 6,000,000, so:

6a³ - 1800a² + 180,000a = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 6:

a³ - 300a² + 30,000a = 1,000,000

Bring all terms to left-hand side:

a³ - 300a² + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0

Hmm, so

---------------

 we have a cubic equation here. Let me see if I can factor this or find integer roots.

Possible rational roots are factors of 1,000,000 divided by factors of 1, so possible integer roots could be divisors of 1,000,000. Since a must be an integer between 0 and 150 (since c = 300 - 2a must be non-negative, so 300 - 2a ≥ 0 => a ≤ 150).

Let me test a = 100:



---------------

100³ - 300*(100)^2 + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000

= 1,000,000 - 300*10,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000

= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0. So a = 100 is a root. That's the symmetric case.

Therefore, (a - 100) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or factor it out.

Let me write the cubic as (a - 100)(a² + pa + q) = a³ - 300a² + 30,000a -1,000,000.

Expanding the left side:

a³ + (p - 100)a² + (q - 100p)a - 100q

Set equal to original cubic:

a³ - 300a² + 30,000a -1,000,000

Therefore, equate coefficients:

p - 100 = -300 ⇒ p = -200

q - 100p = 30,000 ⇒ q - 100*(-200) = q + 20,000 = 30,000 ⇒ q = 10,000

-100q = -1,000,000 ⇒ -100*10,000 = -1,000,000, which holds.

Thus, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a² - 200a + 10,000) = 0

Now, set each factor to zero:

a - 100 = 0 ⇒ a = 100, which we already knew.

Then, the quadratic: a² - 200a + 10,000 = 0

Let's solve this quadratic:

a = [200 ± √(200² - 4*1*10,000)] / 2

Compute discriminant:

200² - 40,000 = 40,000 - 40,000 = 0

So, discriminant is zero, so a = 200/2 = 100.

Therefore, the quadratic has a double root at a = 100. Therefore, the cubic equation only has a = 100 as a root (with multiplicity 3?), but in reality

---------------

, the quadratic factor gives only a = 100 again. So essentially, the only solution when a = b is a = 100, leading to c = 300 - 200 = 100. So that's the symmetric solution again.

Hmm, so when two variables are equal, the only solution is the fully symmetric case. Therefore, perhaps the

---------------

 only solution with two variables equal is the all-equal case. Therefore, maybe all solutions must have all variables equal? But that

---------------

 might not be the case. Let's check another case.

Suppose one variable is zero. Let's see if that can lead

---------------

 to a solution.

Suppose c = 0, then a + b = 300, and the equation becomes:

a²b + a²*0 + b²a + b²*0 + 0²a + 0²b = a²b + ab² = ab(a + b) = ab*300 = 6,000,000

So, 300ab = 6,000,000 ⇒ ab = 20,000.

So we need non

---------------

negative integers a, b such that a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000.

Let me see if this is possible.

Let me set variables: Let a and b be roots

---------------

 of the quadratic equation x² - 300x + 20,000 = 0.

Compute discriminant: 300² - 4*1*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000.

Square

---------------

 root of discriminant is 100. Therefore,

x = [300 ± 100]/2 ⇒ x = (400)/2 = 200 or x = 200/2 = 100.

Wait, so

---------------

 the roots are 200 and 100. Therefore, (a, b) can be (200, 100) or (100, 200). Therefore, when

---------------

 c = 0, we have two solutions: (200, 100, 0) and (100, 200, 0). But since variables are ordered, but in the problem, the triples are considered as ordered triples? Wait, the problem says "triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c)", so order

---------------

 matters. So each permutation counts as different.

Wait, actually, when c=0, we have (200,100,0), (100,200,0), (200,0,100), (100,0,200), (0,200,100), (0,100,200). Wait, but actually, if

---------------

 we set c=0, then the first two variables must be 200 and 100 in some order, so there are two ordered triples with c=0. Similarly, if we set a=0 or b=0, each

---------------

 would give similar solutions.

Wait, let me clarify. Let me consider the case when one variable is zero. Suppose c = 0, then as

---------------

 above, a and b must be 200 and 100. So the triples where c=0 are (200,100,0), (100,200,0). Similarly, if a=0, then b + c = 300 and bc = 20,000, so same

---------------

 as above: (0,200,100), (0,100,200). Similarly, if b=0, then (200,0,100), (100,0,200). So total of 6 triples where one variable is zero.

Wait, so these are valid solutions. Therefore, there

---------------

 are solutions where variables are not all equal. So that's good to know.

Therefore, the problem has more solutions than just the symmetric one.

So, so

---------------

 far, we have the symmetric solution (100,100,100) and six solutions where one variable is zero and the other two are 200 and 100. But

---------------

 perhaps there are other solutions where none of the variables are zero and not all equal?

Hmm, let's check.

Alternatively, maybe there

---------------

 are solutions where two variables are non-zero and equal but not 100?

Wait, let me think. Let's suppose that two variables are equal, but not 100. Let's suppose

---------------

 a = b ≠ 100. Then, as before, c = 300 - 2a. Then, the

---------------

 equation reduces to the cubic, but we saw that the only solution is a = 100. So in that case, the

---------------

 only case when two variables are equal is the symmetric case. Therefore, other solutions must have all variables distinct and non-zero, or have one zero.

Alternatively, perhaps there are solutions where two variables are equal

---------------

 but not 100? Wait, but according to the cubic equation, only a=100 gives a solution. So perhaps

---------------

 not.

Alternatively, perhaps the case where one variable is zero gives all non-symmetric solutions. Let me see.

Wait, let's check

---------------

 another scenario. Let me see if there are solutions where all variables are different and non-zero.

Suppose all variables are different and non-zero. Let me see if such triples exist.

Alternatively, let me consider

---------------

 the equation again:

We have the equation a + b + c = 300 and the expression equals 6,000,000.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 we can use the equation we derived earlier:

a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 6abc = 9,000,000.

Hmm

---------------

, maybe this can be related to another identity?

Wait, I recall that:

(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a)

Wait, is that true?

Wait, let me check:



---------------

Let me compute (a + b)(b + c)(c + a).

First, expand (a + b)(b + c) = ab + a c + b² + b c

Then multiply by (c + a):

= (ab + ac + b² + bc)(c + a)

= ab*c + ab*a + ac*c + ac*a + b²*c + b²*a + bc*c + bc*a

= abc + a²b + a c² + a²c + b²c + a b² + b c² + a b c

Combine like terms:

Terms

---------------

 with a²b: a²b + a b² = ab(a + b)

Similarly, a²c + a c² = ac(a + c)

b²c + b c² = bc(b + c)

Plus 2abc.

Hmm

---------------

, so overall:

(a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - abc

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 another identity. Let me recall:

Alternatively, maybe (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - abc.

Let me verify this.

Left side: (a + b)(b + c)(c + a)

Right

---------------

 side: (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - abc

Let me compute the right side:

First, expand (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca):

= a(ab + bc + ca) + b(ab + bc + ca) + c(ab + bc + ca)

= a²b + a b c + a²c + a b² + b²c + b c a + a c² + b c² + c²a

Wait

---------------

, this seems messy, but grouping terms:

= a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + a c² + b c² + 3a b c

Then subtract abc:

= a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + a c² + b c² + 3abc - abc

= a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + a c² + b c² + 2abc

Now

---------------

, compare to left side:

Left side expansion earlier was:

abc + a²b + a c² + a²c + b²c + a b² + b c² + a b c

= a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + a c² + b c² + 2abc

Which matches the right side. Therefore, the identity holds:

(a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - abc.

Therefore, perhaps

---------------

 this can be useful?

Wait, let's see. Let me think of the equation we had:

a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 6abc = 9,000,000.

Hmm

---------------

, also, note that:

We have another identity:

a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca).

Therefore, if we can express a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 6abc in terms of that

---------------

.

Let me see:

a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 6abc = (a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc) + 9abc

= (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca) + 9abc

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Alternatively, maybe express

---------------

 in terms of (a + b + c), ab + bc + ca, and abc.

Let me denote:

Let S = a + b + c = 300,

P = ab + bc + ca,

Q = abc.

Then,

We can write a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = S^3 - 3SP + 3Q.

Wait, let me confirm that:

Yes, using

---------------

 the identity:

a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Therefore,

a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = S³ - 3 S P + 3 Q.

So then

---------------

,

a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 6 Q = S³ - 3 S P + 3 Q + 6 Q = S³ - 3 S P + 9 Q.

Therefore

---------------

, according to our equation,

S³ - 3 S P + 9 Q = 9,000,000.

We know S = 300, so substit

---------------

uting:

300³ - 3*300*P + 9 Q = 9,000,000.

Compute 300³: 27,000,000.

So,

27,000,000 - 900 P + 9 Q = 9,000,000.

Rearranged:

-900 P + 9 Q = 9,000,000 - 27,000,000 = -18,000,000.

Divide both sides by 9:

-100 P + Q = -2,000,000.

So,

Q = 100 P - 2,000,000.

Hmm, so we have a relationship between Q and P: Q = 100 P - 2,000,000.

Now, perhaps

---------------

 we can relate this to other expressions. Since S = 300, P = ab + bc + ca, and Q = abc.

We also know that for three variables,

(a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca),

so,

a² + b² + c² = S² - 2 P = 300² - 2 P = 90,000 - 2 P.

But not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use

---------------

 the equation Q = 100 P - 2,000,000 and combine it with other equations involving P and Q.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 think of variables in terms of P and Q. Let me see.

Alternatively, let me consider that in the case where one variable is zero, say c=0, then:

Then, P = ab + 0 + 0 = ab,

Q = abc = 0,

and S = a + b = 300.

In

---------------

 that case, substituting into Q = 100 P - 2,000,000,

0 = 100 ab

---------------

 - 2,000,000,

so ab = 20,000,

which matches our previous result. So that's consistent.

Alternatively, in the symmetric case, where a = b = c = 100,

then P = 3*(100*100) = 30,000,

Q = 100*100*100 = 1,000,000,

then 100 P - 2,000,000 = 100*30,000 - 2,000,000 = 3,000,000 - 2,000,000 = 1,000,000 = Q. So that also holds.

Therefore, the equation Q = 100 P - 2,000,000 is valid in both cases.

Now

---------------

, perhaps we can find another equation involving P and Q?

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the equation from the original problem's

---------------

 second condition. Wait, but that's already how we derived the Q = 100 P - 2,000,000.

Alternatively, perhaps we

---------------

 can use the relation between P and Q with the variables.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that for three variables a, b, c with a + b + c = S, we can param

---------------

etrize them in terms of two variables, and then set up equations. Let me try that.

Let me set variables as a and b, so c = 300 - a - b.

Then, P = ab + bc + ca = ab + b(300 - a - b) + a(300 - a - b)

Let me compute that:

ab + 300b - ab - b² + 300a - a² - ab

Wait, let's do it step by step:

First term: ab

Second term: b*c = b*(300 - a - b) = 300b - ab - b²

Third term: a*c = a*(300 - a - b) = 300a - a² - ab

Adding all three terms:

ab + (300b - ab - b²) + (300a - a² - ab)

Combine like terms:

ab - ab - ab = -ab

300b + 300a

- b² - a²

So total:

- ab + 300(a + b) - (a² + b²)

Hmm, that seems a

---------------

 bit complex. Maybe better to just write P in terms of a and b:

P = ab + b(300 - a - b) + a(300 - a - b)

= ab + 300b -ab - b² + 300a -a² -ab

Wait, let

---------------

 me compute again:

First term: ab

Second term: b*(300 - a - b) = 300b -ab - b²

Third term: a*(300 - a - b) = 300a -a² -ab

Now, adding all three terms:

ab + (300b -ab - b²) + (300a -a² -ab)

Let me combine term by term:

ab - ab - ab = -ab

300b + 300a

- b² - a²

Thus, P = -ab + 300(a + b) - (a² + b²)

Alternatively, we

---------------

 can write P = 300(a + b) - (a² + b² + ab)

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 not so helpful.

Alternatively, let me note that Q = abc = ab(300 - a - b).

So, Q

---------------

 = ab(300 - a - b)

So, if we can express Q in terms of P, maybe?



---------------

Alternatively, since we have Q = 100 P - 2,000,000, perhaps

---------------

 we can set up an equation with variables a and b.

Alternatively, maybe this is getting too involved. Let me think of possible integer

---------------

 solutions.

We already have two types of solutions: the symmetric triple (100,100,100) and the six triples with one zero and the other two as 200 and 100.

Are there any other triples?

Suppose there

---------------

 exists a triple where none of the variables are zero and all are different. Let me see if such triples can exist.

Suppose a, b, c are all positive integers, distinct, adding to 300, and satisfying the given equation.

Let me try

---------------

 to find such a solution.

Suppose a = 150, b = 100, then c = 50.

Check if this works.

Compute the expression a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Let

---------------

 me compute each term:

a²b = 150²*100 = 22500*100 = 2,250,000

a²c = 150²*50 = 22500*50 = 1,125,000

b²a = 100²*150 = 10,000*150 = 1,500,000

b²c = 100²*50 = 10,000*50 = 500,000

c²a = 50²*150 = 2500*150 = 375,000

c²b = 50²*100 = 2500*100 = 250,000

Adding all together:

2,250,000 + 1,125,000 = 3,375,000

+1,500,000 = 4,875,000

+500,000 = 5,375,000

+375,000 = 5,750,000

+250,000 = 6,000,000.

Wait a second! That adds up to exactly 6,000,000!

So (150, 100, 50) is another solution. And

---------------

 since the variables are all different and non-zero, this is a new solution.

Hmm, so this is another solution. Therefore, there are more solutions than previously thought.

Therefore, my

---------------

 initial thought that only the symmetric case and the cases with a zero were solutions was incorrect. There are more solutions where all variables are different and non-zero.

Therefore, I need to consider such

---------------

 cases as well.

So let's analyze this example. The triple (150, 100, 50) gives the required sum and product. Let me check the other

---------------

 permutations of this as well.

Indeed, any permutation of (150, 100, 50) will also satisfy the equations since the problem is symmetric. So

---------------

 there are 6 permutations (since all three numbers are distinct), so that's 6 more solutions.

Wait, but let

---------------

 me confirm with another permutation. Let's take (100, 150, 50):

Compute the expression:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b

a=100, b=150, c=50.

a²b = 100²*150 = 1,000,000*0.15 = 150,000? Wait, no, 100^2 is 10,000, so 10,000*150 = 1,500,000

a²c = 10,000*50 = 500,000

b²a = (150)^2 *100 = 22,500*100 = 2,250,000

b²c = 22,500*50 = 1,125,000

c²a = 2500*100 = 250,000

c²b = 2500*150 = 375,000

Adding them up:

1,500,000 + 500,000 = 2,000,000

+2,250,000 = 4,250,000

+1,125,000 = 5,375,000

+250,000 = 5,625,000

+375,000 = 6,000,000.

Yes, that works too. So indeed

---------------

, all permutations of (150,100,50) are valid. So that's 6 solutions.

Hmm

---------------

, so this is a new family of solutions. So now we have:

1. The symmetric solution: (100,100,100) – 1 solution.

2. Solutions with a zero: (

---------------

200,100,0) and permutations – 6 solutions.

3. Solutions with (150,100,50) and permutations – 6 solutions.

Wait, but maybe

---------------

 there are more such solutions? Let's see.

Let me check another example. Let me see if (200, 50, 50) works. Wait, sum

---------------

 is 200 +50 +50=300.

Compute the expression:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Let a=200, b=50, c=50.

Compute each term:

200²*50 + 200²*50 + 50²*200 + 50²*50 + 50²*200 + 50²*50

First term: 40,000*50 = 2,000,000

Second term: same as first: 2,000,000

Third term: 2500*200 = 500,000

Fourth term: 2500*50 = 125,000

Fifth term same as third: 500,000

Sixth term same as fourth: 125,000

Total: 2,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 4,000,000

+500,000 +125,000 = 4,625,000

+500,000 +125,000 = 5,375,000

Hmm

---------------

, which is less than 6,000,000. So that's not a solution.

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 another triplet. Let's see.

Suppose (180, 90, 30). Let's check sum: 180+90+30=300.

Compute the expression:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b

a=180, b=90, c=30.

Compute each term:

a²b = 180²*90 = (32,400)*90 = 2,916,000

a²c = 32,400*30 = 972,000

b²a = 8100*180 = 1,458,000

b²c = 8100*30 = 243,000

c²a = 900*180 = 162,000

c²b = 900*90 = 81,000

Adding them all:

2,916,000 + 972,000 = 3,888,000

+1,458,000 = 5,346,000

+243,000 = 5,589,000

+162,000 = 5,751,000

+81,000 = 5,832,000.

Still less than 6,000,000. Hmm.

Alternatively, let me think of the example

---------------

 (150, 100, 50). Let me see if there's a pattern here. The numbers are in a ratio 3:2:1 (150:100:50). Let me see if scaling

---------------

 that ratio might give another solution.

Suppose we try (225, 75, 0). Wait, but that has a zero. Let's see:



---------------

Wait, 225 +75 +0=300. The product terms would be:

a²b + a²c + ... But

---------------

 since c=0, similar to previous cases.

Wait, but if we set variables as multiples, maybe?

Alternatively, let me see

---------------

 if there's another triplet like (150,100,50). Let's see if (120, 120, 60) works.

Sum: 120+120+60=300.

Compute the expression:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

a=120, b=120, c=60.

Compute each term:

a²b = 120²*120 = 14,400*120 = 1,728,000

a²c = 14,400*60 = 864,000

b²a = same as a²b = 1,728,000

b²c = same as a²c = 864,000

c²a = 60²*120 = 3,600*120 = 432,000

c²b = same as c²a = 432,000

Adding all terms:

1,728,000 + 864,000 = 2,592,000

+1,728,000 = 4,320,000

+864,000 = 5,184,000

+432,000 = 5,616,000

+432,000 = 6,048,000.

Hmm, that's over. 6,048,000 which

---------------

 is more than 6,000,000. Close but not exact.

Hmm, so that's not a solution.

Alternatively, maybe (160, 80, 60). Let's see sum is 160+80+60=300.

Compute the expression:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b

a=160, b=80, c=60.

Compute each term:

160²*80 = 25,600*80 = 2,048,000

160²*60 = 25,600*60 = 1,536,000

80²*160 = 6,400*160 = 1,024,000

80²*60 = 6,400*60 = 384,000

60²*160 = 3,600*160 = 576,000

60²*80 = 3,600*80 = 288,000

Adding all terms:

2,048,000 +1,536,000 = 3,584,000

+1,024,000 = 4,608,000

+384,000 = 4,992,000

+576,000 = 5,568,000

+288,000 = 5,856,000.

Still under 6,000,000. Hmm.

Alternatively, let's think of another approach. Since we found (

---------------

150,100,50) works, perhaps this is part of a family where variables are in an

---------------

 arithmetic progression?

Wait, 50, 100, 150 is an arithmetic progression with difference 50. Maybe other

---------------

 arithmetic progressions?

Suppose variables are x - d, x, x + d. Then their sum is 3x = 300 ⇒ x = 100. So the variables would be 100 - d, 100, 100 + d. Let's check if this works.

Let me set a = 100 - d, b = 100, c = 100 + d. Then sum

---------------

 is 300.

Compute the expression:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Let me compute term by term.

First, compute a²b:

(100 - d)^2 * 100

Similarly, a²c = (100 - d)^2*(100 + d)

b²a = 100²*(100 - d)

b²c = 100²*(100 + d)

c²a = (100 + d)^2*(100 - d)

c²b = (100 + d)^2*100

Let

---------------

 me compute each term:

1. a²b = (10000 - 200d + d²)*100 = 1,000,000 - 20,000d + 100d²

2. a²c = (100 - d)^2*(100 + d) = [(100 - d)(100 - d)]*(100 + d) = (100 - d)^2*(100 + d)

Let me expand (100 - d)^2*(100 + d):

First compute (100 - d)^2 = 10,000 - 200d + d²

Multiply by (100 + d):

= (10,000 - 200d + d²)(100 + d)

= 10,000*100 + 10,000*d - 200d*100 -200d*d + d²*100 + d^3*1

= 1,000,000 + 10,000d - 20,000d - 200d² + 100d² + d³

Simplify:

1,000,000 - 10,000d - 100d² + d³

So term 2: 1,000,000 -10,000d -100d² + d³

3. b²a = 10,000*(100 - d) = 1,000,000 -10,000d

4. b²c = 10,000*(100 + d) = 1,000,000 + 10,000d

5. c²a = (100 + d)^2*(100 - d)

Similarly to term 2, let's compute:

(100 + d)^2 = 10,000 + 200d + d²

Multiply by (100 - d):

= (10,000 + 200d + d²)(100 - d)

= 10,000*100 -10,000*d + 200d*100 -200d² + d²*100 -d^3

= 1,000,000 -10,000d + 20,000d -200d² +100d² -d³

Simplify:

1,000,000 +10,000d -100d² -d³

6. c²b = (100 + d)^2*100 = (10,000 + 200d + d²)*100 = 1,000,000 + 20,000d + 100d²

Now, let's add all six terms:

Term1 + Term2 + Term3 + Term4 + Term5 + Term6

Let me write each term:

Term1: 1,000,000 -20,000d +100d²

Term2: 1,000,000 -10,000d -100d² +d³

Term3: 1,000,000 -10,000d

Term4: 1,000,000 +10,000d

Term5: 1,000,000 +10,000d -100d² -d³

Term6: 1,000,000 +20,000d +100d²

Now, let's combine term by term:

Start with the constants:

1,000,000 (Term1) +

1,000,000 (Term2) +

1,000,000 (Term3) +

1,000,000 (Term4) +

1,000,000 (Term5) +

1,000,000 (Term6) =

6,000,000

Now the terms with d:

Term1: -20,000d

Term2: -10,000d

Term3: -10,000d

Term4: +10,000d

Term5: +10,000d

Term6: +20,000d

Adding these:

-20,000d -10,000d -10,000d +10,000d +10,000d +20,000d

Let me compute step by step:

Start with -20k -10k = -30k

-30k -10k = -40k

-40k +10k = -30k

-30k +10k = -20k

-20k +20k = 0

So the total for d terms is 0.

Now the terms with d²:

Term1: +100d²

Term2: -100d²

Term3: 0

Term4: 0

Term5: -100d²

Term6: +100d²

Adding these:

100d² -100d² -100d² +100d² = 0

Now terms with d³:

Term2: +d³

Term5: -d³

Total: d³ -d³ = 0

Therefore, the total sum is 6,000,000 regardless of d?



---------------

Wait a minute! That's fascinating. That means, if the three numbers are in arithmetic progression around 100, then the expression will

---------------

 always equal 6,000,000?

But in our earlier example with d = 50 (so

---------------

 numbers 50, 100, 150), that gives 6,000,000. Similarly

---------------

, if d=0 (all 100s), also gives 6,000,000. So

---------------

 actually, any arithmetic progression centered at 100 with common difference d will satisfy the equation?

Wait, but then why

---------------

 when I tried d=25, like (75, 100, 125), let's check:

Compute

---------------

 the expression for (75, 100, 125):

a=75, b=100, c=125.

Compute each term:

a²b = 75²*100 = 5625*100 = 562,500

a²c = 75²*125 = 5625*125 = 703,125

b²a = 100²*75 = 10,000*75 = 750,000

b²c = 10,000*125 = 1,250,000

c²a = 125²*75 = 15,625*75 = 1,171,875

c²b = 125²*100 = 15,625*100 = 1,562,500

Now add all terms:

562,500 + 703,125 = 1,265,625

+750,000 = 2,015,625

+1,250,000 = 3,265,625

+1,171,875 = 4,437,500

+1,562,500 = 6,000,000.

Yes! It works. So that

---------------

's another solution. So actually, any arithmetic progression with a common difference d will satisfy the equation. Therefore, all triples where the numbers are in arithmetic progression adding

---------------

 to 300 will satisfy the equation?

Wait, but let me confirm with another d.

Take d = 10: (90, 100, 110).

Compute the expression:

a=90, b=100, c=110.

a²b = 8100*100 = 810,000

a²c =8100*110 = 891,000

b²a =10000*90 = 900,000

b²c =10000*110 =1,100,000

c²a =12,100*90 = 1,089,000

c²b =12,100*100 =1,210,000

Adding them up:

810,000 + 891,000 = 1,701,000

+900,000 = 2,601,000

+1,100,000 = 3,701,000

+1,089,000 =4,790,000

+1,210,000 =6,000,000.

Yes! Perfect. So indeed

---------------

, any arithmetic progression centered at 100 with any difference d will satisfy the equation. Therefore, all triples where a, b, c form an arithmetic progression sum

---------------

ming to 300 are solutions.

Therefore, the solutions are:

1. The symmetric triple (100, 100, 100).

2. All triples where the numbers form an arithmetic progression with common difference d (including

---------------

 zero difference, which is the symmetric case).

Wait, but arithmetic progression can also have negative differences? But since we need non-negative integers, the common difference must be such that all terms are non-negative.

Given that the three

---------------

 terms are 100 - d, 100, 100 + d. To have non-negative integers, we need:

100 - d ≥ 0 ⇒ d ≤ 100,

and 100 + d ≤ 300? Wait, no, the sum is fixed at 300. Wait, actually, the three terms add

---------------

 to 300 regardless of d, since (100 - d) + 100 + (100 + d) = 300.

So the only constraint is that each term is non-negative:

100 - d ≥ 0 ⇒ d ≤ 100,

and 100 + d ≥ 0 ⇒ d ≥ -100,

but since d is an integer and the terms are non-negative, d can be from 0 up to 100, inclusive.

Wait, but d can also be negative? Wait

---------------

, if d is negative, say d = -k where k is positive, then the terms would be 100 +k, 100, 100 -k, which is the same as d

---------------

 =k but with the order reversed. Since the problem allows any permutation, considering d positive is sufficient.

Therefore, d can range from 0 to 100, but when

---------------

 d=0, it's the symmetric case. For each d from 1 to 100, we get an arithmetic progression with

---------------

 difference d, but since the variables are ordered, each d gives a unique triple up to permutation.

Wait, actually, for each d from 0 to 100, the triplet (100 -d, 100, 100 +d) is a distinct solution

---------------

, but since the problem counts ordered triples, each permutation of such a triplet counts as a different solution.

Wait, but actually

---------------

, the arithmetic progression can be in any order. For example, if d=50, the triplet is (50, 100, 150), which can be arranged in any order, so all permutations are allowed

---------------

. But when considering d as a parameter, each d gives a unique set of values, and the number of ordered triples would

---------------

 depend on whether the terms are distinct.

Wait, let's clarify:

For d = 0: all terms are 100. So only one ordered triple: (100,100,100).

For d ≠ 0: the triplet has three distinct numbers (

---------------

since 100 -d, 100, 100 +d are all different if d ≠0). Therefore, each such triplet can be permuted in 6 ways (since all three are distinct). However, when

---------------

 d = 100, the terms would be (0, 100, 200). This

---------------

 is similar to the case where one variable is zero. Indeed, when d=100, we get the triplet (0, 100, 200), which is one of the cases we considered earlier with a zero.

Therefore, the arithmetic progression approach actually encompasses both the cases

---------------

 with a zero and the cases with all distinct non-zero terms.

Therefore, the total number of solutions from arithmetic progressions is:

For each d from 0 to 100:

- When d=0: 1 solution.

- When 1 ≤ d ≤ 99: each d gives 6 ordered triples (since all three terms are distinct).

- When d=100: the triplet is (0,100,200), which can be arranged in 3! /1! (since all distinct) = 6 ways, but actually

---------------

, since 0 is one of the terms, the number of permutations is 3 (the zero can be in any of the three positions, and the other two numbers are distinct). Wait, no: the

---------------

 triplet (0,100,200) has all distinct elements, so number of permutations is 3! =6. For

---------------

 example, (0,100,200), (0,200,100), (100,0,200), (100,200,0), (200,0,100), (200,100,0). So yes

---------------

, 6 permutations.

Therefore, for d=100, it's still 6 ordered triples.

Therefore, total solutions from arithmetic progressions would be:

1 (for d=0) + 6*(100) (for d from 1 to 100).

Wait, but hold on:

Wait, d

---------------

 ranges from 0 to 100 inclusive, so that's 101 values of d.

For each d from 1 to 100, there

---------------

 are 6 ordered triples. For d=0, 1 triple.

Therefore total is 1 + 6*100 = 601?

Wait, but that can't be right, because when d=50, for example, we have (50,100,150), which is counted

---------------

 in the arithmetic progression, but also when d=100, we have (0,100,200), which is also

---------------

 counted here. But this seems to include all the cases we considered earlier.

Wait, but let me check with d=50:

d

---------------

=50 gives (50,100,150), which is one of the cases we found earlier

---------------

, and there are 6 permutations, so yes, that's accounted for.

Similarly, d=100 gives (0,100,200), which also has 6 permutations. So,

---------------

 indeed, this counts all the solutions where the numbers form an arithmetic progression, which includes the symmetric case and the cases with a zero.

Therefore, according to this, the total number of solutions from arithmetic progressions is 1 + 6*100 = 601.

Wait, but hold on:

---------------

 but in the problem statement, the variables are nonnegative integers. So when d=100, we have 0, which is allowed. But

---------------

 what about when d=101? Wait, d can't be more than 100, because 100 -d must be non-negative, so d_max

---------------

 is 100.

Therefore, the total number of triples from arithmetic progression is indeed 1 + 6*100 = 601.

But wait a second, that

---------------

 can't be correct because when d=1 and d'= something else, the triplets might overlap?

Wait no, each d gives a distinct set of numbers. For example, d=1 gives (99, 100, 101), which is different from d=2's

---------------

 (98,100,102), etc. So each d gives a unique set of numbers, hence unique permutations.

Therefore, the

---------------

 total number of triples would be 1 + 6*100 = 601.

However, this contradicts our earlier findings

---------------

 where we found two distinct cases: the symmetric case (1 solution), the zero cases (6 solutions when d=100), and other cases like (150,100,50) which are included

---------------

 in the arithmetic progression counts (as d=50).

Wait, but according to this arithmetic progression approach, all solutions are captured by this method. So

---------------

 why do we have 601 solutions? But the problem might have more solutions outside of arithmetic progressions?

Wait, but

---------------

 earlier when I tried (160, 80, 60), it didn't work, so perhaps arithmetic progression is the only way?

Wait, let me think

---------------

. Suppose there exists a solution that is not an arithmetic progression. Let me see.

Suppose a triplet like (120, 100, 80). Let me check if this works.

Sum is 120+100+80=300.

Compute the expression:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

a=120, b=100, c=80.

Compute each term:

120²*100 = 14400*100 = 1,440,000

120²*80 =14400*80 = 1,152,000

100²*120 =10,000*120 = 1,200,000

100²*80 =10,000*80 = 800,000

80²*120 =6,400*120 = 768,000

80²*100 =6,400*100 = 640,000

Adding all terms:

1,440,000 +1,152,000 = 2,592,000

+1,200,000 = 3,792,000

+800,000 = 4,592,000

+768,000 = 5,360,000

+640,000 = 6,000,000.

Oh! Wait a second. This adds up to 6,000,000. But (120, 100, 80) is not an arithmetic progression. Because

---------------

 120, 100, 80 is an arithmetic progression with difference -20, but arranged

---------------

 in reverse. Wait, actually, 120, 100, 80 is an arithmetic progression with common difference -20, so it

---------------

's the same as 80, 100, 120, which is an arithmetic progression with d=20. So actually

---------------

, this is part of the arithmetic progression solutions. So it's included in our previous count.

Therefore, my mistake earlier was not

---------------

 recognizing that (120,100,80) is part of the arithmetic progression with d=20, so

---------------

 it's counted in the 6 permutations for d=20.

Therefore, all solutions are indeed captured by the arithmetic progression approach. Therefore, the total number of solutions is 1 (for d=0) + 6*100 (for d=1 to 100) = 601.

Wait, but hold on,

---------------

 let me check d=25, which I had tried before (75,100,125). Which

---------------

 is included here.

Wait, but let me check another example that is not an arithmetic progression. Suppose (110, 100, 90). Let

---------------

's see:

Sum is 300, and it's an arithmetic progression with d=10. So it's included in the count.

Alternatively

---------------

, let me think of a triplet that isn't in an arithmetic progression. Let's say (130, 100, 70). That

---------------

's an arithmetic progression with d=30, so yes, included.

Alternatively, (140, 100, 60): arithmetic progression with d=40.

Therefore

---------------

, it seems that all solutions are indeed arithmetic progressions. Therefore, the total number of solutions is indeed 601.

Wait, but let

---------------

's confirm with the earlier case of (200, 100, 0). That corresponds to d=100. So yes

---------------

, included in the count.

However, let me check if there are any solutions outside of arithmetic progressions. Suppose I take a triplet like (150, 150, 0). Let's see:

Sum is 150+150+0=300.

Compute the expression:

a²b +a²c +b²a +b²c +c²a +c²b.

a=150, b=150, c=0.

Compute

---------------

 each term:

150²*150 = 22500*150 = 3,375,000

150²*0 =0

150²*150 =3,375,000

150²*0=0

0²*150=0

0²*150=0

Total: 3,375,000 +3,375,000 =6,750,000 which

---------------

 is more than 6,000,000. So this is not a solution.

Alternatively, take (180, 90, 30). Which

---------------

 we had tried before, which didn't work. So not a solution.

Therefore, it seems all solutions must be arithmetic progressions. Thus, the total number of solutions is 1 + 6*100 = 601.

Wait, but hold

---------------

 on. Let me check the case where two variables are equal but not part of an arithmetic progression. For instance, (200, 200, 0). Sum

---------------

 is 400, which is over 300, so invalid.

Wait, (150, 150, 0) as

---------------

 above didn't work. So perhaps all solutions are indeed arithmetic progressions.

Therefore, the total number of triples is 1 (symmetric) + 6*100 (other

---------------

 arithmetic progressions) = 601.

Wait, but hold on: when d ranges from 1 to 100, each gives 6 ordered triples. But when d=100, the triplet includes a zero, but the

---------------

 count is still 6 permutations. So that's correct.

However, let's verify with a smaller case. Suppose instead of 300, the sum was 6. Let's see if the logic holds.

Suppose S = 6. Then the arithmetic progression would have a

---------------

 common difference d, such that the triplet is (3 -d, 3, 3 +d). The possible d's are 0 to 3.

For d=0: (3,3,3) –

---------------

 1 solution.

For d=1: (2,3,4) – 6 permutations.

d=2: (1,3,5) – 6 permutations.

d=3: (0,3,6) – but 0+3+6=9 ≠6. Wait, that

---------------

's a problem.

Wait, in this smaller case, the sum is fixed at 6, so the arithmetic progression must add to 6. So

---------------

 the triplet must be (3 -d, 3, 3 +d). Their sum is 3 -d +3 +3 +d =9, which is not 6. Therefore, this approach fails

---------------

 here. So my previous reasoning might have an error.

Wait, that's a problem. The arithmetic progression approach works for S=300 because the common

---------------

 difference cancels out in the sum. Let me see:

Wait, in the original problem, the arithmetic progression is centered at 100, so (100 -d, 100, 100 +d) adds to 300. But

---------------

 in the smaller case, if I want the triplet to add to S, then the middle term must be S/3. So in the case of S=6, the middle term is 2, so triplet would be (2 -d, 2, 2 +d). Then sum is (2 -d) +2 + (2 +d)=6, which works. So in

---------------

 that case, d can be from 0 to 2 (since 2 -d ≥0 ⇒ d ≤2).

Thus

---------------

, for S=6:

d=0: (2,2,2) – 1 solution.

d=1: (1,2,3) – 6 permutations.

d=2: (0,2,4) – 6 permutations.

Total solutions: 1 + 6+6 =13.

Let

---------------

 me verify with the equation.

Suppose triplet (1,2,3):

Compute a²b +a²c +b²a +b²c +c²a +c²b.

1²*2 +1²*3 +2²*1 +2²*3 +3²*1 +3²*2

= 2 +3 +4 + 12 +9 +18 = 48.

Meanwhile

---------------

, the equation would be:

We need to see what the required value is. Let me compute the expression for S=6:

The

---------------

 required value would be?

Wait, in the original problem, the expression equals 6,000,000 when S=300. For

---------------

 S=6, the equivalent value would depend on the specific equation.

Alternatively, perhaps in the small case, the expression for

---------------

 (1,2,3):

The value is 48, and let's see if that corresponds to the arithmetic progression approach

---------------

.

Alternatively, maybe my arithmetic progression approach is correct when the sum is 3 times the middle term, but in that case, the

---------------

 required equation must hold. Since in the original problem it does, but in this small case, perhaps the equation would have different constraints

---------------

.

Wait, perhaps the key point is that in the original problem, the equation was specifically set so that any arithmetic progression would satisfy it. Let

---------------

 me see.

In the original problem, we had the equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

And

---------------

 through the arithmetic progression, we found that this equation is satisfied for any arithmetic progression. However, in the smaller case with S=6, it

---------------

's not necessarily true that every arithmetic progression would satisfy the equation unless the equation is set accordingly.

Therefore, in the original problem, the specific value 6,000,000 is chosen such that all

---------------

 arithmetic progressions satisfy the equation. Therefore, in our problem, all arithmetic progression triplets are solutions, and there are no other solutions. Thus, the total number is 1 + 6*100 = 601.

Wait, but hold

---------------

 on. Let me confirm with another non-arithmetic progression triplet. Suppose (100, 100, 100) is the symmetric case. What

---------------

 about (150, 100, 50) which is arithmetic progression. But what if I take (12

---------------

0, 100, 80) which is also arithmetic progression. So all the valid triplets I can think of are arithmetic progressions.

Therefore, likely

---------------

 the only solutions are the arithmetic progressions, giving 601 solutions.

But wait, in the problem statement, it

---------------

 says "nonnegative integers". So when d=100, we get (0,100,200), which is allowed. When

---------------

 d=100, the term 100 - d is 0, which is okay. Similarly, d=0 gives all 100s.

Therefore, the total number of triples is 1 (for d=0) plus 6*100 (for d=1 to 100) =

---------------

 601. But let's check if d can be from 0 to 100 inclusive, that's 101 values, but d

---------------

=0 gives 1 solution, and d=1 to 100 gives 6 each, so total is 1 + 6*100 = 601.

However, the

---------------

 problem is asking for the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a,b,c). Each arithmetic progression with difference d from 0 to 100 gives rise

---------------

 to a unique multiset of numbers, and each multiset (except the symmetric one) has 6 permutations. So the total number is indeed 1 + 6*100 = 601.

Wait, but let

---------------

 me check for d=50. The triplet (50,100,150) has permutations like

---------------

 (50,100,150), (50,150,100), etc. So

---------------

 6 permutations. Similarly for d=1 to 99, and d=100 gives 6 permutations.

---------------

 So yes, 601.

But wait, the problem says "triples of nonnegative integers". So order matters. So each

---------------

 permutation is a distinct triple.

Therefore, the answer is 601?

Wait, but in the problem statement's example

---------------

 with (200,100,0), those are included in the count for d=100, which contributes 6 triples, so that's correct

---------------

.

Wait, but let me confirm with another angle. Let me compute the total number using arithmetic progression.

The number of arithmetic progressions with sum 300 is the

---------------

 number of possible differences d from 0 to 100, each giving a unique triplet (up to permutation). Since

---------------

 each non-symmetric triplet has 6 permutations, and the symmetric one has 1, the total is indeed 1 + 6*100 = 601.

However, let

---------------

 me think if there is any possibility of overcounting or undercounting.

Wait, when d=50, the triplet is (50,100,150). The

---------------

 difference here is 50, but the common difference in the progression is 50 (from 50 to 100 is +50, 100 to 150 is +50). So that

---------------

's correct.

Wait, but in terms of the difference between the first and second term, it's +50. So that's an

---------------

 increasing arithmetic progression. The same as d=50.

Alternatively, if you have a decreasing progression like (150,100,50), that's just

---------------

 a permutation and is counted in the same d=50 case.

Therefore, no overcounting.

Therefore, I think the answer is 601. But I

---------------

 want to be sure.

Wait, but let me check the case when d=100. The triplet is (0,100,200). The permutations of this include all orderings, so 6 triples

---------------

. Similarly, when d=99, triplet is (1,100,199), which can be arranged in 6 ways, etc.

Therefore, each

---------------

 d from 1 to 100 contributes exactly 6 triples, and d=0 contributes 1. So total is 601.

However

---------------

, the problem says "nonnegative integers", so 0 is allowed. Therefore, this should be correct.

Wait, but let

---------------

 me check with the original equation.

Wait, when d=100, the triplet is (0,100,200). Let me confirm the equation:

a²b +a²c +b²a +b²c +c²a +c²b.

Let a=0, b=100, c=200.

0

---------------

²*100 +0²*200 +100²*0 +100²*200 +200²*0 +200²*100.

Which

---------------

 is 0 +0 +0 +100²*200 +0 +200²*100.

Compute:

100²*200 = 10,000*200 = 2,000,000

200²*100 =40,000*100 =4,000,000

Total is 6,000,000. Correct.

Similarly for d=50, (

---------------

50,100,150):

As computed earlier, it gives exactly 6,000,000.

Therefore, all arithmetic progressions work.

Therefore, the total number of triples is 601. But

---------------

 wait, the problem says "triples of nonnegative integers (a,b,c)", so ordered triples. So yes, 

---------------

601.

But hold on, in the problem statement's examples, when we had (200,100,0) and permutations, that's 6 triples for d=100, and similarly for each d.

Therefore

---------------

, the answer is 601. But let me think again.

Wait, but when d=0, it's only one triple (

---------------

100,100,100). So total triples:

For d=0: 1

For d=1 to 100: each d

---------------

 contributes 6 triples ⇒ 100×6 = 600

Total: 1 + 600 = 601.

Therefore

---------------

, the answer should be 601.

However, I need to make sure that all arithmetic progressions are distinct and

---------------

 that there are no overlapping triplets counted multiple times.

Suppose two different d's give the same triplet? For example, can d1 and d2 produce the same triplet?

Suppose d1 ≠ d2. Suppose

---------------

 (100 -d1, 100, 100 +d1) and (100 -d2, 100, 100 +d2) are the same triplet. Then d1 must equal d2. Therefore

---------------

, each d gives a unique triplet (as a multiset). Therefore, the count is correct.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is 601.

Wait, but the

---------------

 problem might have a different answer. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the arithmetic progression approach. Let me check

---------------

 the equation again.

We showed earlier that for any arithmetic progression (a, b, c) with a + b + c = 300, the expression equals 6,000,000. So

---------------

 all such triplets are solutions. And there are 601 ordered triples as per above.

Therefore, the answer should be 601. But let

---------------

 me see if there's a different way to compute it.

Alternatively, since the variables are nonnegative integers, the number of ordered triples where a, b, c form an arithmetic progression is:



---------------

For each possible middle term m, and common difference d such that the three terms are non-negative.

But in our case, the middle term must be 100, since the sum is 300. Because in an arithmetic progression of three terms, the middle term is the average. Since 300/3 = 100. Therefore, all arithmetic progressions must have middle term 100, so the terms are 100 -d, 100, 100 +d.

Therefore, the common

---------------

 difference can be from 0 to 100, as we had.

Therefore, the number of such ordered triples is indeed 1 + 6×100 = 601.

Thus, I think the answer is 601. However, let

---------------

 me check again with another example.

Take d=1: triplet (99,100,101). The

---------------

 permutations of this are 6 different ordered triples, each valid. All of these satisfy the equation.

Similarly, for d=2, etc

---------------

., all the way up to d=100.

Therefore, the total is 601. But let me check

---------------

 if the problem counts different orderings as different triples. Since the problem says "triples of nonnegative integers (a,b,c)", and

---------------

 unless specified otherwise, ordered triples are considered distinct even if they are permutations. So yes, the answer is 601.

Wait, but in

---------------

 the problem statement's example of (200,100,0) and permutations, those are all considered different, so that

---------------

's 6 triples for d=100, which is included in the 600 from d=1 to 100, plus 1 for d=0.

Therefore, the final answer is 601. But

---------------

 let me see if that's correct.

Wait, but let me compute the number of ordered triples for each d:

For d=0: only (100,100,100). So 1.

For d=1 to 100:

Each d gives three distinct numbers, so each

---------------

 has 6 permutations. So 100×6 = 600.

Total is 601.

Hence, I believe the answer is 601. So I should put that in a box.

But wait, just

---------------

 to ensure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me think of how many triplets there are when d=100:

The triplet is (0,100,200). The permutations are:

(0,100,200), (0,200,100), (100,0,200), (100,200,0), (200,0,100), (200,100,0). That's 6, correct.

Similarly for d=50, (50,100,150) has 6 permutations.

Therefore

---------------

, yes, the total is 601. So I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{601}


To solve the problem of finding the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a, b, c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by analyzing the given equations.

First, we note that the second equation can be rewritten using the identity for symmetric sums. We use the identity:
\[
(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b) + 6abc
\]
Given \(a + b + c = 300\), substituting into the identity and simplifying, we find that the second equation is

---------------

 satisfied if the variables form an arithmetic progression centered at 100. This is because the terms in the second equation simplify to \(6,000,000\) for any arithmetic progression \

---------------

((100 - d, 100, 100 + d)\) where \(d\) is a nonnegative integer.

We consider the arithmetic progression triples

---------------

 \((100 - d, 100, 100 + d)\) for \(d\) ranging from 0 to 100. Each \(d\) gives a unique set of values:
- When \(d = 0\), the triple is \((100, 100, 100)\), which is 1 solution.
- For each \(d\) from 1 to 100, the triple consists of three distinct numbers, which can be permuted in 6 ways. Thus, each \(d\) contributes 6 solutions.

Summing these contributions:
- For \(d = 0\), we have 1 solution.
- For \(d\) from 1 to 100, each contributes 6 solutions, totaling \(100 \times 6 = 600\).

Adding these together, the total number of solutions is:
\[
1 + 600 = 601
\]

Thus, the number of triples \((a, b, c)\) is \(\boxed{601}\).<|im_end|>
