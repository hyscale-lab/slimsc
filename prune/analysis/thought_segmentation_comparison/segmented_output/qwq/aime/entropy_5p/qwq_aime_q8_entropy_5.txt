Okay, so I need to solve this problem where there are two real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that two logarithmic equations hold: log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^(4y) also equals 10. And I need to find the product xy. Hmm, let me think step by step.

First, let me recall the logarithm properties. The logarithm log_b(a) is the exponent you need to raise b to get a. So, if log_x(y^x) = 10, that means x^10 = y^x. Similarly, log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 would mean that y^10 = x^{4y}. 

Wait, let me write that down properly. 

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the definition of logarithm, this translates to x^10 = y^x. 

Similarly, the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10, so y^10 = x^{4y}. 

So now I have two equations:

1) x^{10} = y^x

2) y^{10} = x^{4y}

Hmm, so I need to solve these two equations for x and y, both greater than 1, and find xy. 

This looks a bit complicated because the variables are in both the base and the exponent. Maybe taking logarithms on both sides would help? Let me try that.

Starting with the first equation: x^{10} = y^x. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

10 ln x = x ln y.

Similarly, for the second equation: y^{10} = x^{4y}, taking natural logs:

10 ln y = 4y ln x.

Hmm, so now I have:

Equation 1: 10 ln x = x ln y

Equation 2: 10 ln y = 4y ln x

Hmm, maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other. Let me see.

Let me denote ln x as A and ln y as B. Then the equations become:

Equation 1: 10 A = x B

Equation 2: 10 B = 4y A

But x and y are exponentials of A and B, since A = ln x ⇒

---------------

 x = e^A, similarly y = e^B. Hmm, but maybe that complicates things. Alternatively, maybe express ln y from the first equation and substitute into the second?

From the first equation: 10 ln x = x ln y ⇒ ln y = (10 / x) ln x.

Then plug this into the second equation:

10 * [(10 / x) ln x] = 4y ln x.

Wait, let me check. The second equation is 10 ln y = 4y ln x. So substituting ln y from the first equation:

10*(10/(x) * ln x) = 4y ln x.

Simplify left side: (100 / x) ln x = 4y ln x.

Assuming ln x is not zero (since x >1, so ln x >0), we can divide both sides by ln x:

100/x = 4y

Therefore, y = (100)/(4x) = 25/x.

So y is 25 over x. Okay, that's a relation between y and x. So now, if

---------------

 I can express y in terms of x, maybe substitute back into one of the original equations.

Let me recall that we had from the first equation: ln y = (10/x) ln x. Since y =25/x, then ln y = ln(25/x) = ln25 - ln x.

Therefore, substituting into that expression:

ln25 - ln x = (10/x) ln x.

Hmm, so that

---------------

 gives an equation in terms of x only. Let me write that:

ln25 - ln x = (10 / x) * ln x.

Let me denote ln x as t, so that ln25 - t = (10 / x) * t. But x is e^t, since t = ln x ⇒ x = e^t. Therefore, substituting x as e^t:

ln25 - t = (10 / e^t) * t.

Hmm, but that might complicate things with exponentials. Alternatively, maybe rearr

---------------

ange terms:

Bring all terms to one side:

ln25 = t + (10 t)/x.

But x is e^t, so x

---------------

 = e^t, so substituting:

ln25 = t + (10 t)/e^t.

Hmm, this seems a bit tricky. Maybe there

---------------

's a better way. Let me see if I can find x such that this equation holds. Let me think if there is an integer or simple value that satisfies

---------------

 this.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another substitution or approach. Let's see.

Alternatively, since we have y =25/x, substitute

---------------

 this into the first equation. Wait, the first original equation was x^{10} = y^x. Since y is 25/x, then:

x^{10} = (25/x)^x

So, x^{10} = (25^x)/(x^x)

Multiply both sides by x^x:

x^{10} * x^x = 25^x

Which is x^{x +10} =25^x

Div

---------------

ide both sides by x^x:

x^{10} = (25^x)/x^x = (25/x)^x

Wait, that's going back to the same equation. Hmm.

Alternatively, taking

---------------

 the equation x^{10} = (25/x)^x, which can be written as x^{10} =25^x /x^x, so multiplying

---------------

 both sides by x^x gives x^{x +10} =25^x.

Then, taking both sides to the power of 1/x:

x^{1 +10/x} =25.

Hmm, so

---------------

 x^{1 +10/x} =25. Let me write that as x^{(x +10)/x} =25.

Hmm

---------------

, maybe taking natural logs again:

[(x +10)/x] * ln x = ln25

So,

(1 + 10/x) * ln x = ln25

Hmm, so

---------------

 this is similar to the previous equation. Let me see if I can find x here. Let me think of possible integer values for x. Let me try x=5.

Testing x=5:

Left side: (1 +10/5)*ln5 = (1+2)*ln5 =3*ln5 ≈3*1.609≈4.827. But ln25 is ln(5^2)=2 ln5≈3.218*2≈3.218*2=6.438. Not equal. So that's not right

---------------

.

Wait, wait, ln25 is ln(25)≈3.218? Wait, no, ln(25) is ln(5²)=2 ln5≈2*1.609≈3.218? Wait, no, 1.609*2 is about 3.218? Wait, actually

---------------

 ln5 is approximately 1.609, so 2*1.609≈3.218. But 25 is e^3.218? Wait, but 25 is 5 squared, so ln

---------------

25 is indeed 2 ln5≈3.218, so if x=5, then left side is 3*ln5≈4.828, which is less than ln25≈3.218? Wait, no, wait,

---------------

 3*1.609 is 4.828, which is greater than 3.218. Wait, but

---------------

 4.828 is greater than 3.218. So that's not equal. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 x=25?

Let me try x=25:

Left side: (1 +10/25)*ln25 = (1 +0.4)*ln25 =1.4 * ln25 ≈1.4*3.218≈4.505. But ln25 is 3.218, so 1.4 times that is about

---------------

 4.505, which is not equal to ln25≈3.218. Not equal.

Hmm, maybe x= 10?

Left

---------------

 side: (1 +10/10)*ln10 = (2)*ln10≈2*2.302≈4.605. ln25 is ~3.218. Not equal.

Hmm. Maybe x= something else. Let me see. Let me think

---------------

 of x=5^(something). Let me suppose that x is 5^k, then maybe y=25/x=25/(5^k)=5^(2 -k). Maybe that can

---------------

 help?

Let me try x=5^k. Then y=5^{2 -k}. Let me see if this substitution helps.

First

---------------

 equation: x^{10} = y^x.

Substituting x=5^k and y=5^{2 -k}:

(5^k)^10 = (5^{2 -k})^{5^k}

Left side:5^{10k}

Right side:5^{(2 -k)*5^k}

Therefore, 

---------------

10k = (2 -k)*5^k.

Hmm, so 10k = (2 -k) 5^k.

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 this can be manageable. Let me see if I can find k here.

Let me try k=1:

Left:10*1=10, Right: (2-1)*5^1=1*5=5. Not equal.

k=2:

Left:10*2=20, Right: (2-2)*5^2=0*25=0. Not.

k=0: Not allowed, since x must be greater than1, so k>

---------------

0.

k=0.5:

Left:10*0.5=5, Right: (2 -0.5)*5^{0.5}=1.5*sqrt(5)≈1.5*2.236≈3.354. Not equal.

Hmm, maybe k= something else. Let me try k= log base 5 of something?

Alternatively, perhaps trying

---------------

 k= log_5 (something). Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe let me think of the second equation again. Since we had y=25/x, so

---------------

 if I can also use the second equation, which was y^{10}=x^{4y}. Let me substitute y=25/x here.

So, (25/x)^{10} =x^{4*(25/x)}.

Hmm, that

---------------

's (25^{10})/(x^{10}) =x^{100/x}*x^4? Wait, no, 4*(25/x) is 100/x, so exponent is 100/x. Wait, 

---------------

4y is 4*(25/x). So exponent is 4y=100/x. Wait, so right

---------------

 side is x^{(100)/x}.

Therefore, equation becomes:

(25/x)^{10} =x^{100/x}

Let

---------------

 me write 25 as 5², so 25/x is (5²)/x. Then left side is (5²/x)^10 =5^{20}/x^{10}

So, 5^{20}/x^{10} =x^{100/x}

Multiply both sides by x^{10}:

5^{20}=x^{100/x +10}

Hmm, so 5^{20}=x^{(10x +100)/x}

Taking natural logs:

20 ln5 = [(10x +100)/x] ln x

Hmm, so

---------------

 20 ln5 = (10(x +10)/x) ln x.

Divide both sides by 10:

2 ln5 = ( (x +10)/x ) ln x

Which is the same as (

---------------

1 +10/x) ln x = 2 ln5

Wait a second, that's exactly the equation we had earlier!

---------------

 So that's consistent. So, whether we use first equation or second equation, we end up with the same equation. So that's

---------------

 good.

So, the key equation is (1 +10/x) ln x = 2 ln5.

Hmm, so solving

---------------

 (1 +10/x) ln x = 2 ln5.

Wait, perhaps if I let x=5, then:

Left side: (1 +10/5)*ln5= (3)*ln5 ≈3*1.609≈4.827, and 2 ln5≈3.218. Not equal.

Hmm, but

---------------

 if x=25:

Left side: (1 +10/25)*ln25 = (1.4)*(3.218)≈4.505, which is more

---------------

 than 2 ln5≈3.218. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps x= sqrt(5^something). Maybe x=5^a, so let me try substit

---------------

uting x=5^a, so that ln x =a ln5. Then:

Equation becomes (1 +10/(5^a)) * a ln5 = 2 ln5.

Divide both sides by ln5:

(1 +10/(5^a)) *a =2

So,

a + (10a)/5^a =2.

Hmm, so

---------------

 need to solve for a in:

a + (10a)/5^a =2.

Hmm, perhaps trying a=1:

1 + (10*1)/5^1 =1 + 2=3≠2.

a=0.5:

0.5 + (10*0.5)/5^0.5=0.5 +5/sqrt(5)=0.5 +5/(2.236)≈0.5 +2.236≈2.736>2.

Hmm, a=0. Let's see a=0.

---------------

 Not valid, since x>1 implies a>0.

a=2:

2 + (20)/25=2 +0.8=2.8≠2.

Hmm, a=?



---------------

Let me see, perhaps a= log_5 (something). Alternatively, trying a= ln something?

Alternatively, maybe a

---------------

=10/x term? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps trying a=0. Let's see, but x>1, so a must be positive. Maybe a

---------------

=0. Let me see, but no.

Alternatively, perhaps trying a=0. Let me think.

Wait, maybe trying

---------------

 a= (something between 0.5 and 1). Let me try a=0.7:

0.7 + (10*0.7)/5^0.7 ≈0.7 +7/(5^0.7). What is 5^0.7?

5^0.7= e^{0.7 ln5}≈ e^{0.7*1.609}≈e^{1.126}≈3.085.

So 7/3.085≈2.27. So total≈

---------------

0.7+2.27≈2.97>2.

Hmm, still too big.

a=0.6:

0.6 + (6)/5^0.6.

5^0.6≈e^{0.6*1.609}=e^{0.965}≈2.627.

Thus 6/2.627≈2.285. Total≈0.6+2.285≈2.885.

Still higher than 2.

Hmm, a=0.4:

0.4 + (4)/5^0.4.

5^0.4≈e^{0.4*1.609}=e^0.643≈1.901.

So 4/1.901≈2.104. Total≈0.4 +2.104≈2.504.

Still too big. Hmm.

Hmm, maybe

---------------

 a=0.2?

0.2 + (2)/5^0.2.

5^0.2≈e^{0.2*1.609}=e^0.322≈1.38.

2/1.38≈1.449. So total≈0.2+1.449≈1.649 <2. So between a=0.2 and a=0.4, the function crosses 2?

Wait, but

---------------

 at a=0.2, it's 1.649, a=0.3:

0.3 + (3)/5^0.3.

5^0.3≈e^{0.3*1.609}=e^0.482≈1.619.

3/1.619≈1.853. Total≈0.3+1.853≈2.153>2. So between a=0.2 and a=0.3.

At a=0.25:

0.25 + (2.5)/5^0.25.

5^0.25= sqrt(sqrt5)≈1.495.

2.5/1.495≈1.673. Total≈0.25+1.673≈1.923 <2.

Hmm, so between a=0.25 and 0.3. Let me try a=0.28.

a=0.28:

0.28 + (2.8)/5^0.28.

5^0.28≈e^{0.28*1.609}=e^{0.4505}≈1.568.

2.8/1.568≈1.789. Total≈0.28+1.789≈2.069.

Close to 2.069, which is over

---------------

 2. Let's try a=0.27:

0.27 + (2.7)/5^0.27.

5^0.27≈e^{0.27*1.609}=e^0.434≈1.544.

2.7/1.544≈1.749. Total≈0.27 +1.749≈2.019.

Still

---------------

 over 2. a=0.26:

0.26 + 2.6 /5^0.26.

5^0.26≈e^{0.26*1.609}=e^0.418≈1.519.

2.6 /1.519≈1.712. Total≈0.26+1.712≈1.972.

Hmm, so between 0.26 and 0.27.

a

---------------

=0.265:

0.265 + (2.65)/5^0.265.

5^0.265≈e^{0.265*1.609}=e^(0.265*1.609)= e

---------------

^(0.426)= approx 1.531.

2.65 /1.531≈1.729. So total≈0.265 +1.729≈1.994.

Almost 2. Close

---------------

.

a=0.266:

0.266 + (2.66)/5^0.266.

5^0.266≈e^{0.266*1.609}= e

---------------

^(0.428)≈1.534.

2.66/1.534≈1.735. Total≈0.266 +1.735≈2.001.

So

---------------

 that's very close to 2. So a≈0.266.

Hmm, so approximately a≈0.266. Thus

---------------

 x=5^a≈5^0.266. Let me compute 5^0.266:

Take natural log: ln(5^0.266)=0.266*1.609≈0.428. So e^0.428≈1.534. So x≈1.534.

Hmm, so x is approximately 1.534, then y=25/x≈25/1.534≈16.3.

But the

---------------

 problem states that x and y are real numbers greater than 1. So maybe there is an exact solution here?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a substitution I can make. Let me think again.

We

---------------

 had the equation (1 +10/x) ln x = 2 ln5. Let me see if I can manipulate this equation into

---------------

 a form that allows substitution.

Let me set t = x/5. Let me see, maybe that helps? Let x=5t. Then,

---------------

 substituting into the equation:

(1 +10/(5t)) * ln(5t) = 2 ln5.

Simplify 10/(5t)=2/t, so:

(1 + 2/t) * [ln5 + ln t] = 2 ln5.

Hmm, expanding this:

[ (1)(ln5) + (1)(ln t) + (2/t)(ln5) + (2/t)(ln t) ] = 2 ln5.

Hmm, not

---------------

 sure if that helps. Let me see:

Bring all terms to left side:

(1 + 2/t)(ln5 + ln t) -2 ln5 =0.

Hmm, expanding

---------------

:

(ln5 + ln t) + (2/t)(ln5 + ln t) -2 ln5=0

Combine

---------------

 terms:

ln5 + ln t -2 ln5 + (2/t)(ln5 + ln t)=0

So,

- ln5 + ln t + (2/t)(ln5 + ln t)=0

Hmm, still

---------------

 complicated. Maybe another substitution?

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is designed to have x and y as powers of 5? Since 25 is 5 squared. Let me see

---------------

.

Suppose x is 5^a and y is 5^b. Then, since y=25/x=25/(5^a)=5^{2 -a}, so b=2 -a. Let me try this substitution.

Let x=5^a, y=5^{2−a}. Then, plug into original equations.

First equation: log_x(y^x)=10. Let's compute log base x of y^x.

log_{5^a}( (5^{2−a})^{5^a} )

=

---------------

 log_{5^a}(5^{(2−a)5^a} )

= [(2 -a)5^a] / a, since log_{5^a}(5^k)=k/a.

Set this equal to 10:

[(2 -a)5^a]/a =10.

Second equation: log_y(x^{4y})=10.

Similarly, log_{5^{2−a}} ( (5^a)^{4*5^{2−a}} )

= log_{5^{2−a}} (5^{a*4*5^{2−a}} )

= [a *4*5^{2−a} ] / (2 -a) =10.

So,

---------------

 the second equation is [4a*5^{2 -a}]/(2 -a)=10.

So now, we have two equations:

1) [(2 -a)5^a]/a =10

2) [4a*5^{2 -a}]/(2 -a)=10

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 we can denote equation1 and equation2 and multiply them together?

Multiplying equation1 and equation2:

[(2 -a)5^a /a ] * [4a*5^{2 -a}/(2 -a)] =10*10=100.

Simplify left side:

The (2 -a) cancels, a cancels with the a in denominator, so:

5^a *4 *5^{2 -a}=4*5^{a + (2 -a)}=4*5^2=4*25=100.

So indeed

---------------

, the product is 100=100. So, that doesn't give us new information. So, the two equations are dependent. So, we need to solve one of them for a.

Let me take equation1: [(2 -a)5^a]/a =10.

Let me rearrange:

(2 -a)5^a =10a.

Hmm, trying

---------------

 to find a such that this holds.

Let me try a=1:

Left: (2-1)*5^1=1*5=5, right:10*1=10. Not equal.

a=0.5:

Left: (2-0.5)*5^0.5=1.5*sqrt(5)≈1.5*2.236≈3.354. Right:10*0.5=5. Not equal.

a=2:

Left: (2-2)*5^2=0*25=0. Right:10*2=20. Not.

a=0. Let's see, but a must be positive.

---------------

 Hmm.

Wait, maybe a= log_5 something? Not sure. Alternatively, let me try a= log_5 (something).

Alternatively, let

---------------

 me try a= ln(10a)/(ln5) + something. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, let me try

---------------

 a=0. Let me see, but a>0. Maybe a= (something between 0.5 and 1). Let me try a=0. Let me think.



---------------

Wait, perhaps a= (2/3). Let me try a=2/3≈0.6667.

Left side: (2 -2/3)*5^{2/3}≈(4/3)*(5^{2/3}).

5^{2/3}=cube root of 25≈2.924.

So 4/3 *2.924≈3.898. Right side:10*(2/3)≈6.666. Not equal.

Hmm. Maybe

---------------

 a=0. Let me try a=0.4.

a=0.4:

Left side: (2 -0.4)*5^0.4≈1.6*(5^0.4).

5^0.4≈e^{0.4*ln5}≈e^{0.4*1.609}=e^0.643≈1.901.

Thus, 1.6*1.901≈3.042. Right side:10*0.4=4. Not equal.

Hmm, a=0.3:

Left: (2-0.3)*5^0.3≈1.7*(1.619)≈2.752. Right:3. Not equal.

Hmm. Maybe

---------------

 a=0. Let me see, perhaps trying a=0.2:

Left: (2 -0.2)*5^0.2≈1.8*(1.379)≈2.482. Right:2. So close

---------------

?

Wait, 10a=2 when a=0.2, so right side is 2. Left is 

---------------

1.8*1.379≈2.482>2. Hmm.

Hmm, so if a=0.2, left is ~2.48, right is 2. So

---------------

 need a bit higher a to make left smaller?

Wait, when a increases from 0.2 to 0.3, left decreases from ~2.48 to ~2.75? Wait no, no

---------------

, wait when a=0.2, left is (1.8)*1.379≈2.48,

---------------

 and when a=0.3, (1.7)*(1.619)≈2.75? Wait that's actually increasing?

Wait, no

---------------

, 5^{a} increases as a increases, so (2 -a) decreases as a increases, so the product may

---------------

 have a minimum?

Hmm, perhaps plotting the function would help, but since I can't do that here, maybe trying a

---------------

=0.25:

Left: (2 -0.25)*5^0.25≈1.75*1.495≈2.616. Right:10*0.25=2.5. So left≈2.616 vs right=2.5. Close.

Hmm, so at

---------------

 a=0.25, left is 2.616 vs 2.5. Hmm. Let's try a=0.26:

Left: (2 -0.26)=1.74; 5^0.26≈e^{0.26*1.609}=e^0.418≈1.518. So 1.74*1.518≈2.64. Right:10*0.26=2.6. So left≈2.64 vs right=2.6. Close.

a=0.265:

Left: (2-0.265)=1.735; 5^0.265≈e^{0.426}=1.531. 1.735*1.531≈2.655. Right:2.65. Hmm, so close

---------------

.

a=0.266:

Left: (2 -0.266)=1.734; 5^0.266≈e^{0.266*1.609}=e^0.428≈1.534. 1.734 *1.534≈2.658. Right:10*0.266=2.66. So left

---------------

≈2.658 vs right≈2.66. Very close. So a≈0.266.

So approximately

---------------

, a≈0.266, so x=5^a≈1.534, and y=25/x≈16.3. But

---------------

 the problem says "real numbers", so maybe there's an exact solution here? Let me check if there's an exact value.

Wait, let me think

---------------

 again. The equations are symmetric in some way. Let me see if there's a substitution where x*y is a constant.

---------------

 Since we need to find xy.

Wait, suppose that xy =k. Maybe if I can find k such that equations are satisfied. Let me see.

Let

---------------

 me let k=xy. Since y=25/x, then k= x*(25/x)=25. Wait, so that would mean xy=25? But if

---------------

 that's the case, then regardless of x and y, as long as y=25/x, their product is 25. Wait, but is

---------------

 that possible?

Wait, hold on. The problem states that both x and y are greater than 1, so their product is 25? Let

---------------

 me check if that's consistent with the equations.

Wait, if xy=25, then y=25/x, which is exactly the relation we had earlier. So,

---------------

 the product is 25. But let me confirm if that's indeed the case.

Wait, because the equations lead us to y=25/x, so their

---------------

 product is 25. So, regardless of the values of x and y (as long as they satisfy the equations), their product must be 25. Therefore, the answer is 25?

Wait, but in

---------------

 the problem, it says "Find xy". So, maybe the answer is 25?

But wait, let me think

---------------

 again. The problem says "There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that...", so if

---------------

 the equations lead to xy=25, then the answer is 25. But let me confirm with the equations.

From the first equation, we derived that y=25/x, so indeed, xy=25. So regardless

---------------

 of the specific x and y, their product must be 25. Therefore, the answer is 25.

Wait, but why

---------------

 did I go through all that trouble solving for a? Maybe I overcomplicated it. Let me see.

Wait, the

---------------

 first equation gives x^{10}=y^x, and second equation gives y^{10}=x^{4y}. From

---------------

 the first equation, we can write y =x^{10/x}. Then substitute this into the second equation:

(y)^10 = (x^{10/x})^10 =x^{100/x}=x^{4y}

But since y= x^{10/x}, so 4y=4x^{10/x}

Thus, equation becomes x^{100/x}=x^{4x^{10/x}}

Therefore, exponents must be equal (since x>1, so the function is injective):

100/x =4x^{10/x}

Hmm, but

---------------

 this might not help directly. Wait, but if we let’s see, since we already have that y=25/x, so maybe

---------------

 substituting that into the second equation gives us the same relation. So perhaps the key point is that y=25/x, so their product is 25. Therefore, the answer is 25. So

---------------

 perhaps the problem is designed so that even if you can't find exact x and y, their product is fixed?

Wait, but let me check with my approximate values. If x≈1.534, then y≈16.3, and their product is≈

---------------

25. So that seems correct. So the answer is 25.

Wait, but the problem didn't specify that x and y have to be integers, so even if they

---------------

 are not nice numbers, their product is fixed. Therefore, the answer is 25. So I think that's it. So

---------------

 the answer is 25.

Wait, but let me confirm once more with the equations.

Starting with log_x(y^x)=10 ⇒

---------------

 x^{10}=y^x.

log_y(x^{4y})=10 ⇒ y^{10}=x^{4y}.

If

---------------

 we let’s suppose that xy=25, so y=25/x. Then substituting into first equation:

x^{10} = (25/x)^x ⇒x^{10}=25^x/x^x ⇒x^{10+x}=25^x ⇒x^{x+10}=25^x ⇒(x)^{x+10}= (5^2)^x ⇒x^{x+10}=5^{2x}

Taking both sides to the power 1/x:

x^{1 +10/x}=5^2 ⇒x^{1 +10/x}=25.

Which

---------------

 is the equation we had before. So, this equation must hold, but regardless of the solution to this equation, the product xy is fixed at 25. Therefore, even if we can't solve for x and y explicitly, their product is always 25. Therefore, the answer is 25.

Yes

---------------

, that makes sense. I think I overcomplicated by trying to find exact values of x and y, but the problem only asks for their product, which is fixed by the relation y=25/x. Therefore, the answer is 25.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{25}


Given the equations \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\), we start by converting these logarithmic equations into their exponential forms.

For the first equation:
\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10 \implies x^{10} = y^x
\]

For the second equation:
\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \implies y^{10} = x^{4y}
\]

We then express \(y\) in terms of \(x\) from the first equation. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of \(x^{10} = y^x\), we get:
\[
10 \ln x = x \ln y \implies \ln y = \frac{10}{x} \ln x
\]

Substituting \(\ln y = \frac{10}{x} \ln x\) into the second equation, we first convert it to natural logarithms:
\[
10 \ln y = 4y \ln x
\]

Substituting \(\ln y\) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
10 \left( \frac{10}{x} \ln x \right) = 4y \ln x
\]

Simplifying, we get:
\[
\frac{100}{x} \ln x = 4y \ln x
\]

Assuming \(\ln x \neq 0\) (since \(x > 1\)), we can divide both sides by \(\ln x\):
\[
\frac{100}{x} = 4y \implies y = \frac{25}{x}
\]

Thus, we find that \(y = \frac{25}{x}\). The product \(xy\) is therefore:
\[
xy = x \left( \frac{25}{x} \right) = 25
\]

This result holds regardless of the specific values of \(x\) and \(y\) as long as they satisfy the original equations. Hence, the product \(xy\) is indeed fixed at 25.

\[
\boxed{25}
