Okay, so I have this problem here about arranging chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me read it again carefully. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but we can use some of them. The conditions are that each cell has at most one chip, all chips in the same row and column must be the same color, and the arrangement has to be maximal—meaning you can't add any more chips without breaking the rules. Hmm, okay.

First, let me parse the conditions. Each row must have chips of the same color, and each column must also have chips of the same color. So

---------------

, if a row has any chips, they’re all white or all black. Same with the columns. Also, the arrangement is maximal, so you

---------------

 can't add another chip anywhere without violating the color conditions. So that means every empty cell must be in a row or column that already has the other color? Or maybe that

---------------

 every empty cell is blocked by a row or column that's already full? Wait, not sure yet.

Let me think of the

---------------

 constraints. Since each row must have chips of the same color, the row can be either all white, all black, or empty. Similarly, each column must be all white, all black, or empty. But also

---------------

, the arrangement has to be maximal, so that if you try to add a chip anywhere, you can't. That means that for every empty cell, either

---------------

 its row is already full (but then the row's color would have to be the same as the new chip, but the

---------------

 row is already full?), or the column is already full? Or maybe the row or column is already of the opposite color? Wait, no

---------------

. Let me think again.

Suppose there's an empty cell. If I want to place a chip there, say a white one, then that cell's row must currently be all white or empty, and the column must also be all white or empty. But if the row has some black chips, then I can't place a white there. Similarly, if the column has some black chips, I can't. So

---------------

 to prevent adding a chip, every empty cell must be in a row that is already filled with the opposite color or in a column that is filled with the opposite color. Wait, no

---------------

. Wait, actually, the row must be all of the same color as the chip you want to place, or empty. So

---------------

 if you want to place a white chip in an empty cell, that row must either be all white or empty, and the column must be all white or empty. But

---------------

 if the row is already all black, then you can't place a white there. Similarly, if the column is already all black, you can't. So

---------------

 for the arrangement to be maximal, every empty cell must be in a row that's already colored with the opposite color or in a column that's already colored with the opposite color. Otherwise

---------------

, you could place a chip of the opposite color there?

Wait, perhaps a better way is to think that in order to block

---------------

 adding any more chips, every empty cell must be in a row that's already full (so you can't add more to

---------------

 that row) or the row is of the opposite color (so you can't add the same color as the existing ones)

---------------

 or similarly for the column. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try an example.

Suppose I have a grid where some

---------------

 rows are colored white and some black, and some columns similarly. Let's think of the maximal condition. For the arrangement to be maximal, there

---------------

 can't be any empty cell where you could place a chip of either color without violating the row or column constraints. So for any empty cell (i,j), either:

- The row i is already all

---------------

 white, so you can't place a black chip there, and also the row is full (so can't place another white either

---------------

?), but actually, if the row is all white, then you can't place a black, but you could maybe place a white? Wait no—if the row is all white, then it

---------------

's already filled with white chips? Wait, no, maybe the row is not necessarily filled, but all existing chips in the row are white. Wait, the

---------------

 problem says "each cell contains at most one chip". So a row can have some white chips, but not all. But the

---------------

 color of the row is determined by the chips present—if there are any chips in the row, they must all be the same color. So a

---------------

 row can have 0 chips (so no color), 1 chip (must be all white or all black), up to 5 chips all

---------------

 of the same color. Similarly for columns.

But the maximal condition requires that you cannot add any more chips. So for any empty cell (i,j), if

---------------

 you wanted to place a white chip there, then the row i must already have some black chips (so can't add white) or the column j must already have some black chips (so can't add white), or the row is already full with white (so can't add more white), or the column is already full with white (so can't add more white). Wait, but actually

---------------

, if the row is not full but all white, then you can add another white, right? Unless the column is filled

---------------

 with white? Hmm, so actually, the maximal condition requires that for every empty cell, you can't add any chip (either color) without violating the constraints. Therefore, for any empty cell (i,j), either

---------------

:

- The row i has at least one black chip (so can't add white) and the column j has at least one black chip (so can't add white?

---------------

 Wait no, if the row has black chips, you can't add white there, but you could add black only if the column allows it? Wait, this

---------------

 is getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the maximal condition is equivalent to the following: For every row, either the row is entirely

---------------

 white, entirely black, or it's empty. Similarly for every column. Wait, no, that might not be the case. Wait

---------------

, actually, the maximal condition is that you can't add any chip. So suppose a row is partially filled with white chips. Then you could add another white chip to that row unless the row is already full. Wait, but if the row is partially filled with white chips, then you can add more white chips as long as the row isn't full, but that

---------------

 would still keep the row's color as white. However, the maximal condition requires that you cannot add any more chips. So that

---------------

 would mean that every row is either entirely filled with white, entirely filled with black, or empty. Wait, but if a row is partially filled but not full, then you could add another chip of the same color, so it's not maximal. Therefore, in

---------------

 a maximal arrangement, every row must be entirely filled with one color or empty. Similarly, every column must be entirely filled with one color or empty. Wait, that might be the case.

Wait, let's see

---------------

: If a row is partially filled with white, then you can add more white chips to it until it's full. So unless

---------------

 the row is already full, it's not maximal. Similarly, if it's partially filled with black, same. So a

---------------

 maximal arrangement must have every row either empty or completely filled with one color. Similarly, every column must be empty or completely filled with one color. Because

---------------

 otherwise, you can add more chips to it. Therefore, the maximal condition implies that all rows are either full or empty, and all columns are either full or empty. But

---------------

 also, the rows and columns that are filled must be consistent in color with their columns and rows?

Wait, but rows and columns can

---------------

 be filled with different colors. For example, a row could be all white, and a column could be all black. But then

---------------

 their intersection cell must be... Wait, if a cell is in both a white row and a black column, then that cell cannot have a chip, because the row says it must be white, and the column says it must be black. So that cell must be empty. Hmm, so in

---------------

 this case, the rows and columns that are filled must not conflict with each other. So if a row is filled with white, then all columns intersecting that row must either be white or empty. Wait, no. Wait, actually

---------------

, if a column is filled with black, then any cell in that column must be black. But if that cell is also in a white row, which requires it to be white. So that's a conflict. Therefore, such

---------------

 a cell cannot exist. Therefore, the columns filled with black cannot intersect with rows filled with white. Therefore, the rows filled with white must be in columns that are either white or empty. Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to formalize this.

Suppose that in the grid, some rows are colored white, some black, some empty; same with columns. The

---------------

 intersection of a white row and a black column must be empty. Similarly, the intersection of a black row and a white column must be empty. The intersections of white rows and white columns can have a white chip. The intersections of black rows and black columns can have a black chip. The intersections of a white row and an empty column can have a white chip (

---------------

since the column is empty, so it can accept white). Wait, but if a column is empty, then it can have any color, but since

---------------

 the row is white, the cell must be white. Similarly, if a column is white, then the intersection with a white row can have a white chip. Hmm

---------------

, this is getting a bit complex. Let me think of it in terms of sets.

Let me denote:

Let R be the set of rows that are colored white (so

---------------

 each of these rows is completely filled with white chips), B_rows be the set of rows colored black (each completely filled with black), and the remaining rows are empty.

Similarly, let C be the set of columns colored white, D be the set of columns colored black, and the remaining columns are empty.

Then

---------------

, for the grid to be consistent, the following must hold:

- For any row in R (white row), all columns not in D (since

---------------

 columns in D are black, which can't intersect with white rows). Wait, actually, if a column is in D (black column), then the

---------------

 intersection with a white row must be empty. But since the row is entirely white, those cells in the white row must be white. But the column is black, so the cell must be black. Contradiction. Therefore, such

---------------

 columns (D) cannot intersect with rows in R. Therefore, the columns in D must be entirely disjoint from the rows in R. Similarly, the columns in C (white columns) must not intersect with rows in B_rows (black rows). Wait

---------------

, actually, the columns in C (white columns) can intersect with rows in R (white rows), since both would allow white chips. The

---------------

 problem arises when a column of one color intersects with a row of another color.

Therefore, the rows colored white (R) must not intersect with columns colored black (D). So the columns in D must be entirely outside the rows in R? Wait, no

---------------

, that can't be. Actually, each column in D (black column) must be entirely black, so all the cells in that column must be black. But if there

---------------

's a row in R (white row) that intersects with that column, then that cell would have to be both white (from the row) and black (from the column), which is impossible. Therefore, such

---------------

 a column D cannot have any intersection with any white row. Therefore, the columns in D must be entirely contained in the rows that are not in R (i.e., black

---------------

 rows or empty rows). But the rows that are black (B_rows) can have columns in D (black columns) because

---------------

 both would require black chips. Wait, so actually, the columns in D can be in the black rows, but cannot be in white rows. So

---------------

 the columns D must be entirely within the rows not in R (i.e., B_rows or empty rows). Similarly, columns C (white columns) must be entirely within the rows not in B_rows (i.e., R or empty rows).

Similarly

---------------

, the rows in B_rows (black rows) must not intersect with columns in C (white columns), because that would require a cell to be both black and white. Therefore, columns C must be entirely within rows not in B_rows.

Therefore, the sets

---------------

 R, B_rows, C, D must satisfy that:

- The columns in D (black columns) can only be in rows that are either B_rows or empty.

- The columns in C (white columns) can only be in rows that are either R or empty.

- The rows in R can only have columns that are C or empty (since otherwise

---------------

, a column in D would conflict).

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the intersection of rows and columns. Let me try

---------------

 to model this as a matrix where rows are either white, black, or empty, and columns similarly, with the constraints that whenever

---------------

 a row is white and a column is black, their intersection must be empty, but since the row is white, that cell should be white, and the column black, so that

---------------

's impossible. Therefore, such an intersection cannot exist. Therefore, the white rows must not intersect with black columns. So the columns that are black must be entirely within the non-white rows (i.e., black or empty rows). Similarly, black rows must not intersect with white columns.

Therefore, this

---------------

 is similar to a bipartition of the grid into regions where:

- The white rows (R) can have white columns (C) and empty columns.

- The black rows (B_rows) can have black columns (D) and empty columns.

- The empty rows can have any columns (

---------------

but those columns would have to be either white, black, or empty, but subject to their own constraints).

Wait, this

---------------

 is getting a bit too abstract. Maybe another approach is needed. Let's think of the grid as being partitioned into four regions:

1. Rows in R (white) and columns in C (white): these cells must be white.

2. Rows in R (white) and columns not in C: these

---------------

 columns must be either empty columns or black columns? Wait, no. If a column is not in C (so it's either D or empty), but if

---------------

 it's a column in D (black), then intersecting with a white row is forbidden. Therefore, columns not in C (i.e., D or empty) cannot

---------------

 be in the white rows. Wait, so actually, the columns in D (black) must be entirely outside of the white rows. So columns

---------------

 D must be in rows not in R (i.e., B_rows or empty rows). Similarly, columns C must be entirely in rows not in B_rows.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe we

---------------

 can model this as choosing for each row a color (white, black, or empty) and for each column a color (white, black, or empty), such that whenever a row is white and a column is black, their intersection is empty (i.e., the cell is not in

---------------

 both a white row and black column). But actually, the cell can't exist because it would have conflicting colors. Therefore, such intersections must have no chips, but actually, the rows

---------------

 and columns themselves are colored, so the presence of a chip in that cell would require both the row and column's color to be the same. So

---------------

 if a row is white and a column is black, that cell cannot have a chip. However, the row being white requires that all its cells (including that column) must be white or empty. Since the column is black, the

---------------

 cell can't be black, but the row allows white or empty. Wait, this is confusing again.

Alternatively, perhaps the key

---------------

 is that the rows and columns must form a "consistent" coloring where the intersections don't conflict. The maximal condition then requires that every row is fully

---------------

 colored or empty, and every column is fully colored or empty. Moreover, the colors must be chosen such that the overlapping regions

---------------

 don't have conflicting colors. Let me think of this as a matrix where each row is either white, black, or empty, and each column is similarly. The color

---------------

 of a cell is determined by both its row and column color. If the row is white and column is white, then the cell is white. If the row is white and column is black, then it's a conflict, so that cell must be empty. Similarly, row black and column white would

---------------

 be conflict, so empty. Row black and column black is black. Rows or columns that are empty (i.e., not colored) mean

---------------

 that the cell can be filled with the color of the other direction, but only if that direction is also not conflicting.

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe an

---------------

 alternative approach: since the arrangement must be maximal, every row and column must be as full as possible given the constraints. Therefore, each row is either entirely white, entirely black, or entirely empty. Similarly for columns. But

---------------

 the combination must be such that the intersection of a white row and a black column is empty (since you can't have a chip there). However

---------------

, in a maximal arrangement, any such conflicting cell must be empty, but since the row is white, you could have placed a white chip there unless the column is black. Wait

---------------

, maybe in a maximal arrangement, all non-conflicting cells are filled?

Wait, maybe in a maximal arrangement, for each row that's colored (white or black), it must be completely filled with that color, and similarly for columns. But

---------------

 if a row is white and a column is also white, their intersection is filled with white. If a row is white and a column is empty, then the cell can be filled with white. Wait, but if the column is empty, can

---------------

 it accept white? Since the column is not colored, so it can have any color, but the row is white, so the cell must be white. Therefore, in

---------------

 a maximal arrangement, the column being empty allows the row's color to determine the cell's color. Therefore, in such a case, the cell would be filled with white. But

---------------

 then the column, which was supposed to be empty, now has a white chip. But that contradicts the column being empty. Wait, this

---------------

 is the problem.

Hmm, perhaps the columns and rows that are "empty" can actually have chips as long as they don't violate the color constraints. Wait, no

---------------

. If a column is not colored (i.e., not entirely filled with a single color), but has some chips, then those chips must all be the same color. Wait, the

---------------

 problem states that "all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour". Therefore, a

---------------

 column can't have both white and black chips. Therefore, if a column has any chips, they must all be the same color, so the column is effectively "colored" with that color, even if not completely

---------------

 filled. But the maximal condition requires that you can't add any more chips. Therefore, if a column is not completely filled, but has some chips, then you could add more of the same color unless the row of

---------------

 that cell is already full?

Wait, this is going in circles. Maybe I need to formalize the constraints again.

Let me think

---------------

 of the problem as follows: The grid must be partitioned into white cells, black cells, and empty cells, such that:

1. Every row is either all white, all black, or empty (since otherwise

---------------

, you could add more chips of the existing color).

2. Every column is either all white, all black, or empty (same reasoning).

3. Additionally, the colors

---------------

 must be consistent between rows and columns. That is, if a cell is in a white row and a white column, it must be white. If it's in a white row and a black column, that's impossible, so it must be empty. Similarly for other combinations.

Therefore, the entire

---------------

 grid is determined by choosing for each row a color (W, B, or E) and for each column a color (W, B, or E), with the constraint that whenever a row is colored W and a column is colored B, their intersection must be E, and similarly for other conflicting pairs. Also

---------------

, whenever a row is W and column is W, the cell must be W, etc.

However, in this case, the colors

---------------

 assigned to rows and columns must be such that their intersections don't have conflicting colors. The problem now reduces to counting the number of such color assignments (for rows and columns) that satisfy these constraints, multiplied by the ways of choosing which rows and columns are which colors, but considering the constraints.

Wait, actually, the

---------------

 color assignments must be such that for every row r and column c:

- If row r is W and column c is W, then cell (r,c) is W.

- If row r is W and column c is B, then cell (r,c) must be E (since it

---------------

 can't be both W and B).

- Similarly, row W and column E: column E can accept W, so cell (r,c) is W.

- Row E and column W: cell can be W (since row allows it, column requires W).

Wait, actually, if a row is E (empty), that means it has no chips. So any

---------------

 cell in an empty row must be E, regardless of column color. Wait, no. Wait, if a row is E (meaning it's not colored, so it can have chips as long as they are all the same color.

---------------

 But if the row is E, that might mean it has no chips? Wait, I'm confused again.

Hold on, maybe

---------------

 the problem requires that for a row to have any chips, they must all be the same color, but a row can be partially filled as long as all its chips are the same color. But the maximal condition requires that you cannot add any more chips. Therefore, a

---------------

 row that is partially filled (but not full) can still have more chips added unless the column constraints prevent it. Therefore, maybe

---------------

 the maximal condition requires that every row is either full of one color or empty, and similarly for columns. Because if a row is not full but has chips, you can add more chips

---------------

 of the same color until it's full, hence violating maximality unless it's already full. Therefore, the rows and columns must be entirely

---------------

 filled or empty. That simplifies things.

Therefore, each row is either all white, all black, or empty. Similarly, each column is all white, all black, or empty. Additionally

---------------

, the intersection of a white row and a black column must be empty (since you can't have a cell that's both white and black). Similarly

---------------

, the intersection of a black row and a white column must be empty. The intersections of white rows with white columns must be white, and black rows with black columns must be black. The intersections of a white row with an empty column must be white (since the column is empty, so it can have white chips as

---------------

 the row is white). Wait, but if a column is empty, does that mean it can have any color? No, if

---------------

 a column is not colored (i.e., not entirely filled), but in our current assumption, columns must be entirely filled or empty. Wait, if

---------------

 a column is "empty", meaning it has no chips, then any cell in that column must be empty. Therefore, if a column is empty, then even if the row is white, that cell must be empty. Wait, no

---------------

. If the column is empty (i.e., not colored), then the column doesn't restrict the color, but the row's color would require it to be white. But since the column is empty (has no chips), the

---------------

 cell can be white? Wait, but if the column is empty, that means it has no chips, so the cell must be empty. Wait, now

---------------

 I'm really confused.

Let me clarify:

If a row is colored white (i.e., filled completely with white chips), then all cells in that row must be white. If

---------------

 a column is colored black (filled completely with black chips), then all cells in that column must be black. If a row is empty (has no chips), then all its cells are empty. Similarly for columns.

But

---------------

 when a row is white and a column is black, their intersection cell must be both white and black, which is impossible, so such an intersection cannot exist. Therefore, the

---------------

 white rows must not intersect with black columns. That is, any column that is black cannot be in any white rows. Similarly

---------------

, black rows cannot intersect with white columns.

Therefore, the set of white rows (let's call this set W_rows) must be disjoint from the set of black columns (B_cols). Similarly, the set of black rows (B_rows) must be disjoint from the set of white columns (W_cols). The remaining columns (not in W_cols or B_cols) are empty columns, and the remaining rows (not in W_rows or B_rows) are empty rows.

Additionally

---------------

, the white rows can only intersect with white columns or empty columns. But if a column is empty (not in W_cols or B_cols), then the

---------------

 cells in that column from white rows must be white (since the row is white). However, since the column is empty, that

---------------

 would mean the column is actually not empty—it has white chips. Contradiction. Therefore, columns that are in W_rows must be either in W_cols or B

---------------

_rows? Wait, no.

Wait, this is getting too tangled again. Maybe it's better to model this as a bipartite graph between rows and columns, where choosing

---------------

 a color for each row and column must satisfy the constraints. Let me try to structure this step by step.

First, decide

---------------

 for each row whether it is white, black, or empty. Similarly for each column. The constraints are:

1. If a row is white, then every column that intersects it must either be white or empty. But actually, if the column is black, that would conflict. So any

---------------

 column that is black cannot be in a white row. So the set of black columns must be entirely in the non-white rows (i.e., black or empty rows).

2. Similarly, if a column is white, then all rows intersecting it must be white or empty. So

---------------

 the set of black rows must not intersect with white columns.

3. The same applies for black rows and columns: a black row can only intersect with black columns or empty columns.

Additionally

---------------

, the arrangement is maximal, so every row and column must be as filled as possible. Therefore, rows colored white must be entirely filled with white chips (so all

---------------

 their cells in columns that are not conflicting must be white). Wait, but if a column is empty, does that mean it can accept the row's color? Hmm

---------------

.

Alternatively, perhaps the only way for a row to be white is that all columns that are not black must have their cells in this row as

---------------

 white. Wait, this is getting too convoluted.

Wait, perhaps the key insight is that the grid can be partitioned into four regions:

- The

---------------

 intersection of white rows and white columns: these must be white.

- The intersection of white rows and black columns: must be empty (since conflicting).

- The intersection of white rows and empty columns: but if a column is empty, then

---------------

 it can’t have any chips, so those must also be empty? Wait, but the row is white, so if the column is empty (i

---------------

.e., not colored), but the row is white, can the cell be white? If the column is not colored (i.e., not all

---------------

 black or white), but has a white chip here, then the column would have to be white? Because all chips in the column must be the same color. But

---------------

 if the column is partially filled with white (from this row), but other rows in the column could be empty, then the column isn

---------------

't colored, so it's allowed. Wait, but in the maximal arrangement, the column must be filled as much as possible. If

---------------

 the column has a white chip in a white row, then to be maximal, the column should be filled with white in all rows

---------------

 that allow it. Wait, this is really complicated.

Maybe the problem requires that all rows and columns are either fully colored or empty, and

---------------

 the colors must be compatible. Let me try this approach again.

Suppose that:

- Each row is either W (all white), B (all black), or E (empty).

- Each column is either W, B, or E.

- For any

---------------

 cell (i,j):

  - If row i is W and column j is W: cell is W.

  - If row i is W and column j is B: cell must be E (since conflict).

  - If row i is W and column j is E: column

---------------

 j being E means it can accept any color, but since the row is W, the cell must be W. However, if column j is E, it

---------------

 can have other cells in other rows that might conflict. Wait, no—if column j is E, that means it has no chips, so this

---------------

 cell must also be E? Wait, no—if a column is E (empty), it means it has no chips, so all

---------------

 its cells must be empty. Therefore, if a row is W and column j is E, then the cell (i,j) must be E, even

---------------

 though the row is W. But that would mean the row isn't fully filled, which contradicts the row being W (which should be fully filled). Therefore, this

---------------

 is impossible. Therefore, if a row is W, then all columns must be either W or B (but B would conflict). Wait, no.

---------------

 If a row is W, then every column that intersects it must either be W or E (empty). But if the column is E, then the cell must be E, but the row requires it to be W. Contradiction. Therefore, if

---------------

 a row is W, all columns must be W or B? Wait, no. Wait, if a column is E (empty), then the

---------------

 cell must be E, but the row is W, so it should be W. Therefore, such a column can't be E if the row is W. Therefore, all

---------------

 columns intersecting a W row must be W. Similarly, all columns intersecting a B row must be B. Because otherwise, you

---------------

 get a contradiction.

Wait, this is a key point. Let me think again:

If a row is colored W (so

---------------

 all its cells must be W), then every column that intersects this row must either be W (so their intersection is W) or E

---------------

? But if the column is E, then the cell must be E, conflicting with the row's requirement. Therefore, the column cannot be E. Therefore, any

---------------

 column intersecting a W row must also be W or B? Wait, no—if the column is B, then the cell would have to be B, conflicting with the row's W. Therefore, the only possible columns that can intersect a W row are those columns that are also W. Similarly, columns that are B can only intersect with rows that are B.

Therefore, this leads

---------------

 us to the conclusion that:

- All W rows must only intersect with W columns. That is, the set of W rows and W columns form a subgrid where all those cells are W.

- Similarly, all B rows must only intersect with B columns, forming a subgrid of B cells.

- The remaining rows and columns (not W or B) must be E, and their intersections can only be E,

---------------

 since they can't conflict.

Therefore, the entire grid is divided into three parts:

1. A W subgrid: the

---------------

 intersection of W rows and W columns, filled with white.

2. A B subgrid: the intersection of B rows and B columns, filled with black.

3. The remaining cells (outside both W and B subgrids) must be empty.

Additionally, the W and B subgrids cannot overlap,

---------------

 because a cell can't be both W and B. Also, the W rows cannot intersect B columns, and vice versa.

Therefore, the problem reduces to choosing a subset of rows and columns for the W subgrid, and a subset of rows and columns for the B subgrid, such that:

- The W rows and W columns form a rectangle (all

---------------

 intersections are W).

- The B rows and B columns form another rectangle (all intersections are B).

- The W and B rectangles do not overlap (i.e., no row or column is both W and B).

- The arrangement

---------------

 is maximal, meaning that you can't add any more W or B chips. Since the W and B subgrids are already fully

---------------

 filled within their rectangles, and the remaining cells are in rows or columns that are E (so you can't add anything there without conflicting with existing W or B rows

---------------

/columns). Therefore, this satisfies the maximal condition.

Therefore, the problem is now to count the number of such pairs of (W_rect, B_rect) where W_rect is a rectangle (subset

---------------

 of rows and columns) and B_rect is another rectangle (subset of rows and columns), such that they don't overlap (i.e., no row or column is in both W and B),

---------------

 and the total number of white and black chips used doesn't exceed 25 each.

Wait, but the problem states there are 25 white and 25 black chips available, but we can use any number as long as we don't exceed. Wait, actually, the problem says "some of these chips" so we can use any number up to 25 of each. But the arrangement

---------------

 must satisfy that it's maximal, which in this case is already satisfied by the rectangles being as large as possible given their constraints

---------------

. Wait, actually, in this model, the maximal condition is already satisfied because you can't add any more chips. Because

---------------

 any cell not in W or B is in a row or column that is E, so adding a chip there would require the row or column to be colored, but that would conflict with existing W or B rows

---------------

/columns.

Therefore, the problem reduces to counting all possible such pairs of W_rect and B_rect (non-overlapping rectangles of rows and columns) where:

- The W_rect is determined by choosing some rows (W_rows) and some columns (W_cols), and all intersections are white.

- Similarly, B_rect is determined by choosing B_rows and B_cols, non

---------------

-overlapping with W_rect.

Additionally, the total number of white chips (size of W_rect) must be ≤25, and the total black chips (size of B_rect) must be ≤25. But since the grid is 5x5, the maximum possible for each is 25, so actually

---------------

, the constraints are automatically satisfied as long as the rectangles are within the grid.

However, the problem says "some of these chips", so we

---------------

 can have any size, including zero. But the key is that the two rectangles (W and B) must not share any rows or columns. Because a row cannot be both W and B, and similarly for columns.

Therefore, the rows

---------------

 are partitioned into three sets: W_rows, B_rows, and E_rows (empty). Similarly, columns are partitioned into W_cols, B_cols, E_cols. With the constraints that:

- W_rows and W_cols form a rectangle (all their intersections are W).

- B_rows and B_cols form another rectangle (all their intersections are B).

- W_rows and B_rows are disjoint; similarly, W_cols and B_cols are disjoint.

- The remaining rows and columns (E_rows and E_cols) can

---------------

 have no chips, so their intersections must be empty.

Therefore, the total number of such arrangements is the number of ways to choose W_rows, W_cols, B_rows, B_cols such that:

1. W_rows ∩ B_rows = ∅,

2. W_cols ∩ B_cols = ∅,

3. The W

---------------

_rect (W_rows × W_cols) and B_rect (B_rows × B_cols) are non-overlapping in both rows and columns.

Additionally, since the chips

---------------

 are indistinct, once we choose the rectangles, the number of ways is just 1 for each such configuration (since all white chips are the same, all black chips are the same). Wait, actually, no.

---------------

 Wait, since the problem says "the number of ways to place some of these chips", considering the chips indistinct, so each configuration is uniquely determined by the set

---------------

 of white and black cells. Since the white cells are exactly W_rect and black cells exactly B_rect, each such partition corresponds to exactly one arrangement. Therefore, the total number is the number of possible such pairs (W_rect, B_rect) with the above conditions.

Therefore, we need to compute the number of pairs of subsets

---------------

 (W_rows, W_cols, B_rows, B_cols) as described. Let me think how to count this.

First, note

---------------

 that the entire grid can be divided into four regions:

- W_rect: rows in W_rows, columns in W_cols.

- B_rect: rows in B_rows, columns in B_cols.

- The remaining

---------------

 rows and columns form E regions, which can't have any chips.

The constraints are that W_rows and B_rows are disjoint, and W_cols and B_cols are disjoint.

Therefore, the

---------------

 process is as follows:

1. Choose a subset of rows for W_rows and a subset of columns for W_cols. This defines the white rectangle.

2. From the remaining rows (not in W_rows) and remaining columns (not in W_cols), choose a subset of rows for B_rows and columns for B_cols. This defines the black rectangle.

However

---------------

, we have to consider that the choices for W and B are independent except for the constraints on disjointness.

Alternatively, we

---------------

 can think of it as:

First, decide for each row whether it is W, B, or E.

Similarly, decide for each column whether it is W, B, or E.

But with the constraints:

- For any row,

---------------

 if it is W, then all its columns must be either W or B? Wait no, actually:

Wait, the row is W implies that it must be part of the W_rect, so the columns for

---------------

 that row must be W_cols. So the columns assigned to W must be the same for all W_rows. Wait, no, actually, the columns in

---------------

 W_cols must be the same for all W_rows. Wait, perhaps more precisely:

The W_rows must be a set of rows, and W_cols must be a set of columns. The white rectangle is exactly the intersection of those rows and columns. Similarly for black.

Therefore, the selection

---------------

 is:

- Choose a subset of rows R_W and a subset of columns C_W for the white rectangle.

- Choose a subset of rows R_B (disjoint from R_W) and a subset of columns C_B (disjoint from C_W) for the black rectangle.

The

---------------

 total number is then the sum over all possible R_W, C_W, R_B, C_B of 1, under the constraints that R_B ∩ R_W = ∅ and C_B ∩ C_W = ∅.

Therefore

---------------

, the total number is equal to the number of ways to choose R_W, C_W, R_B, C_B such that R_B and R_W are disjoint, and C_B and C_W are disjoint.

Alternatively, this can be considered

---------------

 as:

First, choose R_W and C_W. Then, choose R_B from the remaining rows (not in R_W) and C_B from the remaining columns (not in C_W). The

---------------

 total number is then the sum over all possible R_W and C_W of [number of ways to choose R_B and C_B from the remaining rows and columns].

However, since the choices

---------------

 for R_B and C_B are independent once R_W and C_W are fixed, the number for each R_W and C_W is (2^{5 - |R_W|} - 1) * (2^{5 - |C_W|} -1 )

---------------

? Wait, no, because R_B can be any subset of the remaining rows (including empty), similarly for C_B. Wait, but actually, the black rectangle can be empty as well. Since

---------------

 the problem allows using some chips, so B can be empty. Therefore, the number of choices for R_B is 2^{5 - |R_W|} (including the empty set), and similarly for C_B.

---------------

 However, the black rectangle is defined by R_B and C_B, so even if one is empty, the rectangle is empty. So

---------------

 the total for each R_W, C_W is (2^{5 - |R_W|}) * (2^{5 - |C_W|}).

But actually

---------------

, we have to consider that if either R_B or C_B is empty, then the black rectangle is empty. So all

---------------

 possibilities are allowed.

Therefore, the total number is the sum over all subsets R_W ⊆ {rows}, C_W ⊆ {columns} of [2^{5 - |R_W|} * 2^{5 - |C_W|} }.

But this

---------------

 counts all possible pairs where the white rectangle is R_W × C_W and the black rectangle is any R_B × C_B where R_B ⊆ rows

---------------

 \ R_W and C_B ⊆ columns \ C_W.

However, this counts all possible combinations, including when the black rectangle is overlapping

---------------

 with the white rectangle? Wait no, because R_B is chosen from rows not in R_W and C_B from columns not in C_W, so they are disjoint in both rows and columns from the white rectangle. Therefore, the total is indeed the sum over all R_W, C_W of 2^{5 - |R_W|} * 2^{5 - |C_W|} }.

But let

---------------

 me confirm with an example. Suppose R_W is all rows and C_W is all columns. Then the white rectangle is the entire grid, so there are no remaining rows or columns for the black rectangle, so the number of black rectangle options is 1 (empty). Therefore, that

---------------

 term would be 2^0 * 2^0 =1, which is correct.

Another example: if R_W and C_W are both empty, then the white rectangle is empty, and the black rectangle can be any subset of rows and columns. Wait, no,

---------------

 in that case, R_B can be any subset of the 5 rows, and C_B any subset of the 5 columns. Therefore

---------------

, the number of black rectangles would be 2^5 * 2^5. But according to the formula, when R_W and C_W are empty, the term is 2^5 * 2^5, which matches.

So the total number is indeed the sum over all subsets R_W and C_W of 2^{5 - |R_W|} * 2^{5 - |C_W|}.

But how

---------------

 do we compute this sum?

Note that the sum over all subsets R_W of rows of 2^{5 - |R_W|} is equal to the sum_{k=0}^5 [C(5,k) * 2^{5 -k} }.

Similarly for the columns.

Therefore, the total number is [sum_{k=0}^5 C(5,k)*2^{5 -k} ]^2.

Wait, because the rows and columns are independent. Let

---------------

 me verify:

Yes, because the total is sum_{R_W} sum_{C_W} [2^{5 - |R_W|} * 2^{5 - |C_W|} } ] = [sum_{R_W} 2^{5 - |R_W|} ] * [sum_{C_W} 2^{5 - |C_W|} } ]

Since the rows and columns are independent. And since the row

---------------

 sum and column sum are the same (both over 5 elements), the total is [sum_{k=0}^5 C(5,k) * 2^{5 -k} } ]^2.

Now

---------------

, compute sum_{k=0}^5 C(5,k)*2^{5 -k}.

Let me compute this sum.

Note that sum_{k=0}^n C(n,k) * x^{n -k} } = x^n sum_{k=0}^n C(n,k) (1/x)^k } = (x + 1)^n by the binomial theorem.

Wait, let's see:

Let me set

---------------

 x = 2. Then sum_{k=0}^5 C(5,k)*2^{5 -k} = 2^5 sum_{k=0}^5 C(5,k) (1/2)^k } = 32 * (1 + 1/2)^5 ?

Wait, let

---------------

 me check:

Wait, actually, let me think of it as:

sum_{k=0}^5 C(5,k) * 2^{5 -k} = sum_{k=0}^5 C(5,k) * 2^{5} / 2^{k} } = 2^5 * sum_{k=0}^5 C(5,k) (1/2)^k }



---------------

Yes, so that is 32 * (1 + 1/2)^5.

Because sum_{k=0}^n C(n,k) a^k = (1 + a)^n. So here a = 1/2, so sum_{k=0}^5 C(5,k)*(1/2)^k = (1 + 1/2)^5 = (3/2)^5.

Therefore, the row sum is 32*(3/2)^5 = 32*(243/32) )= 243.

Wait, let me compute step

---------------

 by step:

(3/2)^5 = (243)/(32). So 32*(243/32) = 243. So the row sum is 243. Similarly, the column sum is also 243, so total is 243^2 = 59049.

Wait, that seems very

---------------

 large. But let's confirm with a small n. Let me test with n=1 (1x1 grid). Then the formula would be [sum_{k=0}^1 C(1,k)*2^{1−k} ]².

For n=1:

sum_{k=0}^1 C(1,k)*2^{1−k} = C(1,0)*2^1 + C(1,1)*2^0 = 1*2 +1*1 = 3. So total is 3²=9. Let's see if that's correct.

In a 1x1 grid, the possible arrangements:

-

---------------

 White rectangle can be the cell or not. Similarly for black.

But with the constraints:

The white and black rectangles can't overlap (since they share the only row and column). So possibilities:

- Neither W nor B: 1 way (empty).

- Only W: choose W_row and W_col (the single row and column), so white chip

---------------

. Then black can't be placed.

- Only B: similarly, black chip.

- Both W and B: impossible, since they would require the single cell to be both W and B.

Therefore

---------------

 total is 1 (empty) +1 (W) +1 (B) =3. But the formula gives 9. Hmm

---------------

, discrepancy. So my approach must be wrong.

Wait, so clearly the formula overcounts. Therefore my earlier reasoning is flawed. Let

---------------

's see where.

In the 1x1 case, according to my previous logic:

The total would be [sum_{k=0}^1 C(1,k)*2^{1−k} ]² = [2 +1]^2 = 9. But actual answer

---------------

 is 3. So there's an error.

Therefore my mistake must be in the way I model the problem. Let's see where

---------------

.

In the 1x1 case, the formula counts:

For each possible W_rect and B_rect where they don't overlap. Since

---------------

 in 1x1 grid, the W_rect can be the cell or not, and similarly B_rect can be the cell or not, but they can't both be chosen.

Wait, actually, the

---------------

 formula counts for each possible W_rect (which is either the cell or empty), then for each such W_rect, the number of B_rects possible is

---------------

 2^{1 - |R_W|} * 2^{1 - |C_W|}.

Wait let's compute

---------------

 it step by step for 1x1:

Possible W_rects:

1. W_rect is empty (i.e., W_rows and W_cols are empty). Then remaining rows and columns are all, so B_rect can be any subset of rows and columns. Since it's 1x1, choosing B_rect as the cell (1

---------------

 row and 1 column) or not. So 2*2 =4 possibilities. Wait but actually, choosing B_rows and B_cols:

---------------

 the rows not in W_rows (which are all rows) and columns not in W_cols (all columns). So B_rows can be the

---------------

 row or not, similarly B_cols can be the column or not. The B_rect is B_rows × B_cols. So if

---------------

 B_rows is chosen (the row) and B_cols is chosen (the column), then B_rect is the cell. If either is not chosen, it's empty. So there are 2 (

---------------

choices for rows) * 2 (choices for columns) =4 possibilities for B_rect. So total for this case (W empty) is 4.

2. W_rect is the cell (i.e., W_rows = {row1}, W_cols={col1}). Then remaining rows and columns are empty. So B_rect must be chosen from empty rows and columns, so only the empty rectangle. So 1 possibility. So total for this case is 1.

Total sum

---------------

: 4 +1 =5? Wait but the total is supposed to be [sum over W_rects (which are 2:

---------------

 empty or filled) of (number of B_rects for each W_rect). So 4 +1=5. But actual total

---------------

 should be 3. Hmm.

Wait the problem is that when W_rect is the cell, B_rect can still be empty, but the

---------------

 total arrangements are:

- W empty, B empty: 1

- W empty, B filled: 1 (the cell is B)

- W empty, B partially? No, since B_rect must be rectangle. Since

---------------

 B_rect is determined by choosing B_rows and B_cols. If you choose B_rows as the row and B_cols as the column, it's the cell. Choosing either

---------------

 not would give empty.

So when W is empty, B can be either filled or empty, so that's two options. Wait but according to the calculation

---------------

, when W is empty, you have 4 options for B_rect: choosing B_rows and B_cols as either included or not. However

---------------

, the B_rect is the intersection of B_rows and B_cols. So:

If B_rows is chosen (yes) and B_cols is chosen (yes), then B_rect is the cell.

If B_rows is yes and B_cols no: B_rect is empty (since B_cols is not chosen, so columns are empty).



---------------

Wait no, the B_rect is the intersection of the chosen B_rows and B_cols. If you choose B_rows (the row) but not B_cols (the column), then B_rect is the intersection of the row and not

---------------

 the column? Wait no, the columns not in W_cols (which are all columns since W_cols is empty). So B

---------------

_cols can be any subset of columns, so choosing B_cols as empty means that the B_rect is B_rows × empty columns, which is empty. Choosing B_cols as the column gives the cell. So the

---------------

 B_rect can be either the cell or empty, depending on B_cols and B_rows. But actually, the number of possible B_rects is the number of possible rectangles,

---------------

 which are:

- The empty rectangle (choosing B_rows as empty or B_cols as empty),

- The full cell (choosing both B_rows and B_cols as the row

---------------

 and column).

Therefore, there are 2 possibilities for B_rect when W is empty: either the cell is B or not. But according to the formula

---------------

, it was 2 (rows choices) * 2 (columns choices) =4, which is incorrect because some choices lead to the same rectangle. For example:

- Choosing B_rows = yes, B_cols = no: the

---------------

 rectangle is rows [row1] and columns [], so empty.

- Choosing B_rows = no, B_cols = yes: columns

---------------

 [col1] and rows [], so empty.

- Choosing B_rows = no, B_cols = no: also empty.

- Choosing B_rows = yes, B_cols = yes: the cell.

Therefore, actually, there are only 2 distinct B_rect possibilities when W is empty: either empty or the cell. Therefore, the count is 2, not 4. Therefore my earlier approach overcounts because it distinguishes between different ways of arriving at the same rectangle. Because

---------------

 choosing B_rows and B_cols independently can lead to the same rectangle via different choices.

Ah, right! The problem is that the number of B_rects isn't 2^{remaining_rows} * 2^{remaining_columns}, because the rectangle is determined by the choice

---------------

 of rows and columns, but the actual number of rectangles is the number of subsets of rows times subsets of columns, but each pair (R_B, C_B) gives a unique rectangle R_B × C_B. However, the count includes all possible such pairs, even those that result in the same rectangle.

---------------

 Wait no, each pair gives a different rectangle. Wait in the 1x1 case, when remaining rows and columns are all, then choosing R_B and C_B as subsets, the

---------------

 rectangles are:

- R_B empty or the row, C_B empty or the column.

Thus:

- R_B empty, C_B empty: rectangle empty.

- R_B empty, C_B full

---------------

: columns full but rows empty ⇒ rectangle empty.

- R_B full, C_B empty: rows full but columns empty ⇒ rectangle empty.

- R_B full, C_B full: the cell.

Thus, only two distinct rectangles: empty or the cell. But

---------------

 the count as 2*2=4 counts the different ways to choose rows and columns even if they result in the same rectangle. Therefore

---------------

, the formula is incorrect because it counts the number of ways to choose R_B and C_B, not the number of distinct rectangles. However, the problem counts each

---------------

 arrangement as a distinct way based on the set of cells chosen, so different choices of R_B and C_B that result in the same rectangle should be considered the same arrangement. Wait, no—

---------------

 actually, the arrangement is uniquely determined by the set of white and black cells. So if two different pairs (R_B, C_B) result in the same black rectangle, then they are the same arrangement. Therefore, the count should be the number of possible pairs of white and black rectangles (W_rect, B_rect) where they don't overlap.

Therefore, the formula

---------------

 overcounts because it counts the number of ways to choose R_B and C_B (which may lead to the same rectangle),

---------------

 but we need to count the number of distinct rectangles.

Therefore my initial approach is incorrect. I need a different method.

Alternative approach:

The

---------------

 problem requires that the white and black rectangles don't share any rows or columns. Therefore, the white rectangle is determined by choosing a subset of rows R_W and columns C_W, and the black rectangle by R_B and C_B, with R_W ∩ R_B = ∅ and C_W ∩ C_B = ∅.

The total number of such pairs (W_rect, B_rect) is equal to the number of ways to choose R_W, C_W, R_B, C_B with those constraints.

This is equivalent to:

First, partition the 5 rows into three parts: W_rows, B_rows, and E_rows.

Similarly, partition the 5 columns into three parts: W_cols, B_cols, and E_cols.

The

---------------

 constraints are that W_rows and B_rows are disjoint, and W_cols and B_cols are disjoint.

For each such partition, the white rectangle is W_rows × W_cols, and the black rectangle is B_rows × B_cols.

The number of such partitions is the number of ways to assign each row to W, B, or E, and each column to W, B, or E, with the constraints that no row is assigned both W and B, and similarly for columns.

Wait, actually, each

---------------

 row can be assigned to exactly one of W, B, or E. Similarly for columns. However, the assignments must satisfy that if a row is in W, it cannot be in B or E? No, the

---------------

 assignments are exclusive: each row is either W, B, or E, mutually exclusive. Similarly for columns.

Therefore, the total number is 3^5 (for rows) multiplied by 3^5 (for columns). However, this counts all possible assignments, but we have to subtract the cases where the white and black rectangles overlap? Wait no, actually, the

---------------

 assignments already ensure that rows assigned to W don't go to B, so the white and black rectangles don't share rows or columns.

Wait actually, the

---------------

 constraints are automatically satisfied because each row is in exactly one of W, B, or E. Therefore, W_rows and B_rows are disjoint. Similarly for columns.

Therefore the total number is indeed 3^5 × 3^5 = 3^10 = 59049. But in the 1x1 case, this would give 3×3=9, which over

---------------

counts as we saw earlier. Wait but in the 1x1 case:

Each row (only one) can be assigned to W, B, or E.

Each column (only one) can be assigned to W, B, or E.

However

---------------

, the white rectangle is rows assigned to W and columns assigned to W.

Similarly for black.

But the cell can be:

- Both W and B: if row is W and column is B, but that's not

---------------

 allowed because the cell would have to be both. Wait no, in this assignment:

If the row is assigned to W and the column to B, then the white rectangle would include the cell (since row is W and column is W?), no.

---------------

 Wait no, the white rectangle is rows in W and columns in W. So if the row is W and column is B, then the cell is not in the white rectangle. Similarly, the black rectangle requires the row to be B and column to be B.

Therefore, in the assignment where row is W and column is B:

- White rectangle: row

---------------

 W and column W (but column is B, so columns W is empty). So white rectangle is empty.

- Black rectangle: row B (not

---------------

 assigned) and column B (assigned). So also empty.

Thus, the cell is empty.

Wait, this is getting too complicated

---------------

. Maybe the total number of assignments is 3^5 × 3^5, but each assignment corresponds to a unique arrangement of white and black rectangles.

---------------

 However, in the 1x1 case:

Each of the 3 row assignments (W, B, E) and 3 column assignments gives a cell

---------------

 state:

For example:

Row assignment W, column assignment W: cell is white.

Row W, column B: cell must be empty (since row

---------------

 W and column B conflict).

Row W, column E: column E means column is not W or B, so column is E. The

---------------

 white rectangle requires columns to be W. Since column is E, the white rectangle is empty. The row is W, but since column isn't W, the cell can't be filled. So the cell is empty.

Similarly, row E, column W: cell must be empty.

Row E, column E: cell is empty.

Row B, column B: cell is black.

Row B, column W: cell empty.

Etc.

Therefore, all

---------------

 9 assignments correspond to valid configurations:

The possible cell states are:

- White: only when row W and column W.

- Black: only when row B and column B.

- Empty: all other cases.

Therefore the total distinct

---------------

 configurations are 3: white, black, empty. But according to the count of assignments, it's 9. So the problem is that different assignments can lead to the same configuration.

Therefore, the total

---------------

 number of distinct arrangements is not 3^10 but less, since different row and column assignments can result in the same cell

---------------

 configuration.

Therefore my previous approach is invalid because it counts assignments rather than distinct configurations.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let's think differently.

The

---------------

 problem requires counting the number of pairs of white and black rectangles (possibly empty) such that:

1. The white rectangle and

---------------

 black rectangle do not share any rows or columns.

2. The white and black rectangles are as large as possible given their rows and columns.

Each

---------------

 such pair defines a unique arrangement where the white cells are exactly the white rectangle, black cells exactly the black rectangle, and the rest empty.

Therefore, to count the number of such pairs, we need to count all possible white rectangles and black rectangles that don't share rows or columns.

A rectangle is determined by its set of rows and columns. So for

---------------

 the white rectangle, choose any subset of rows R_W and subset of columns C_W. Similarly for the black rectangle R_B and C_B, with R_W ∩ R_B = ∅ and C_W ∩ C_B = ∅.

The

---------------

 total number is therefore the number of ways to choose R_W, C_W, R_B, C_B with those constraints.

This is equivalent to:

First choose R_W and C_W.

---------------

 Then choose R_B from the remaining rows (not in R_W), and C_B from the remaining columns (not in C_W).

Therefore the total is the sum over all possible R_W and C_W of [2^{5 - |R_W|} × 2^{5 - |C_W|} } ]

---------------

.

But in the 1x1 case, this would be:

For R_W and C_W:

Case 1: R_W empty

---------------

, C_W empty: then the number of B_rects is 2^1 × 2^1 =4. But actually

---------------

, B_rect can be either the cell (if both rows and columns are chosen) or empty. So 2 options. But

---------------

 according to the formula, it's 4.

Ah, here's the problem: when choosing R_B and C_B, the

---------------

 black rectangle is R_B × C_B. The number of possible black rectangles given remaining rows and columns is indeed the number of subsets of rows (excluding

---------------

 R_W) and subsets of columns (excluding C_W), so it's 2^{5 - |R_W|} × 2^{5 - |C_W|}. However, this includes the case where R_B is empty or C_B is empty, which gives

---------------

 an empty black rectangle. So in the 1x1 case, when R_W and C_W are empty:

Number of black rectangles is 2^1 × 2^1 =4, but the possible black rectangles are:

- R_B empty, C_B empty: empty.

- R_B chosen

---------------

, C_B empty: empty (since columns not chosen).

- R_B empty, C_B chosen: empty.

- R_B and C_B chosen: the cell.

Thus, only

---------------

 2 distinct black rectangles, but the formula counts 4 because it distinguishes between different ways to choose rows and columns that result in the same rectangle. Therefore

---------------

 the formula overcounts.

Hence, my initial approach is flawed because it counts the number of ways to choose the subsets R_B and C_B, not the number of distinct black rectangles. Since

---------------

 different subset choices can lead to the same rectangle.

Wait but in terms of the problem's requirements, the arrangement is uniquely determined by the set of white and black cells. Therefore

---------------

, different choices of R_B and C_B that result in the same black rectangle (and same white rectangle) should be counted as one.

Therefore, the formula counts

---------------

 more than necessary because it distinguishes between different R_B/C_B selections that give the same rectangle. Therefore, the correct count should be the number of possible white rectangles multiplied by the number of possible black rectangles that don't share rows or columns with it.

Thus

---------------

, the total is the sum over all white rectangles of the number of black rectangles that don't intersect it in rows or columns.

To

---------------

 compute this, let's think of it as:

For any white rectangle W (defined by R_W and C_W), the number of possible black rectangles B is the number of rectangles that can be formed from the remaining rows (not in R_W) and remaining columns (not in C_W). The number of such rectangles is (2^{5 - |R_W|} - 1) × (2^{5 - |C_W|} - 1) ?

---------------

 Wait, no. The number of rectangles is the number of possible subsets of rows (excluding R_W) and subsets of columns (excluding C_W), so

---------------

 it's 2^{5 - |R_W|} × 2^{5 - |C_W|}. This includes the empty rectangle (choosing no rows or no columns). Therefore the total is indeed the

---------------

 sum over all white rectangles of 2^{5 - |R_W|} × 2^{5 - |C_W|}.

But in the 1x1 case, this sum would be:

For

---------------

 white rectangle empty (R_W=∅, C_W=∅): 2^1×2^1=4.



---------------

For white rectangle filled (R_W={row}, C_W={col}): 2^0×2^0=1.

Total sum:4 +1=5, but the correct answer is 3 (empty, white, black). So

---------------

 discrepancy.

Wait, but in the 1x1 case, when the white rectangle is filled (the cell), the black rectangle can only be empty (since no rows or columns remain). So that contributes 1 (the

---------------

 white filled case plus black empty).

When the white rectangle is empty, the black rectangle can be empty or filled (the cell). So that contributes 2 (black empty or filled). Thus

---------------

 total is 1+2=3, which matches the correct count. But according to the formula, it's 4+1=5. Therefore

---------------

 the formula is overcounting because when the white rectangle is empty, the black rectangle can also be the same as the white rectangle (the

---------------

 cell), but when white is empty and black is filled, that's counted as separate, but when white is filled and black is empty, that's also counted. But in the formula, when white is empty, the count includes black being filled or not, and when white is filled, it includes black being empty. Thus

---------------

 total is indeed 5, but the actual distinct arrangements are:

- Both empty: counted in white empty and black empty.

- White filled, black empty: counted in white filled and black empty.

- White empty, black filled: counted in white empty and black filled.

Thus total 3 distinct arrangements, but the formula counts 5 because it counts

---------------

 cases where both white and black are non-empty but non-overlapping? Wait in 1x1, if white is non-empty (filled), then black must be empty. Similarly, if black is non-empty, white must be empty. The case where both are non-empty is impossible. Therefore the formula counts:

- White empty, black empty: 1 case.

- White empty, black filled:1.

- White filled, black empty:1.

- White empty, black partially? No, since

---------------

 black must be rectangle.

Wait the formula counts for white empty:

Black can be any rectangle in remaining rows and columns (all of them). So black can be:

- empty

---------------

,

- the cell (full),

so 2 options.

For white filled:

Black must be empty (only option).

For

---------------

 white something else? In 1x1 there's no other white rectangle except empty or full.

Thus total cases: 2+1=3, but the formula gives

---------------

 4+1=5. The discrepancy arises because when the white rectangle is empty, the count for black rectangles includes both

---------------

 the empty and the filled, but when white is empty, the white rectangle is empty, and the black can be anything.

---------------

 So that's 2. When white is filled, it's 1. Total 3. So why does the formula give 5?

Ah! Because when we

---------------

 consider all white rectangles, including those that are not full. For example, in the 1x1 case, a white rectangle could be,

---------------

 say, rows R_W={row} and columns C_W=∅. But then the white rectangle is empty (since columns are empty). But

---------------

 such a selection is allowed in the formula but doesn't correspond to any actual white cells. Wait, but according to the problem, a white rectangle is defined by R_W × C_W. If C_W is empty, then the white rectangle is empty. Similarly, if R_W is empty and

---------------

 C_W is non-empty, the white rectangle is also empty. So in the formula, when we choose R_W and C_W,

---------------

 even if their product is empty, it still counts as a white rectangle (empty). Therefore in the 1x1 case:

All possible white rectangles (R_W, C_W) are:

- R_W empty, C_W empty: white rectangle empty.

- R_W empty, C_W =

---------------

 {col}: white rectangle empty (since rows are empty).

- R_W = {row}, C_W empty: white rectangle empty.

- R_W = {row}, C_W = {col}: white rectangle filled.

Thus there are 4 white rectangles (since there

---------------

 are 2^1 row subsets and 2^1 column subsets, totaling 4). For each of these, we compute

---------------

 the number of black rectangles:

For each white rectangle:

1. W empty (R_W empty, C_W empty):

   Black can be any rectangle in

---------------

 remaining rows (all) and columns (all). So 4 possibilities (as before: 2×2). But the

---------------

 actual distinct black rectangles are 2 (empty or filled). But the formula counts 4.

2. W empty (R_W empty, C_W = {col}):

   Here

---------------

, the white rectangle is empty (since R_W is empty). The remaining rows are all (since R_W is empty), but the remaining columns are columns not in C_W, which is columns

---------------

 not {col}, so columns empty. Therefore the black rectangle must choose rows from all rows (since R_W is empty), and columns from columns not in C_W (which is empty). Thus columns must be chosen from empty, so C_B must be empty. Thus the black rectangle can only be empty (since rows can be chosen but columns must be empty). So number of black rectangles is 2^1 (rows) × 2^0 (columns) = 2×1=2. But the actual possible black rectangles here are:

   Since

---------------

 columns are restricted to empty (because C_W is {col}), so columns available for black are none. Thus black rectangle must have C_B empty, so regardless

---------------

 of R_B, the rectangle is empty. So only 1 possibility: black empty.

   Therefore the formula overcounts here by

---------------

 giving 2.

Similarly for the case where R_W = {row}, C_W empty: same issue, the remaining columns are all, but remaining rows are empty. So black can

---------------

 choose columns freely but rows must be empty. So black rectangle must be empty. So the formula would give 2^0 * 2^1 =2 but actual is 1.

3. W filled (R_W={row}, C_W={col}): then

---------------

 remaining rows and columns are empty, so black can only be empty. So 1.

Therefore the total according to the formula is:

For each

---------------

 of the 4 white rectangles:

1. W empty (R_W empty, C_W empty): 4

2. W empty (R_W empty, C_W={

---------------

col}): 2

3. W empty (R_W={row}, C_W empty): 2

4. W filled (R_W={row}, C_W={col}):1

Total:4+2+2+1=9, which matches the 3^2=9 assignments

---------------

. But the correct distinct configurations are 3.

Thus, the formula counts all possible pairs of white and black rectangles (including those where the white or black rectangle is "

---------------

invalid" in the sense of using rows or columns but not forming a filled rectangle). The problem requires that the white and black rectangles are maximal

---------------

, but in this counting, we're allowing any rectangles, even those that aren't maximal. Wait, but the maximal condition requires that you can't add any more chips. Which

---------------

 is exactly enforced by the rectangles being as large as possible given their rows and columns. If you choose a white rectangle with R_W and C_W, then you

---------------

 can't add any more white chips because all rows in R_W are fully filled in their columns (C_W), and adding

---------------

 to other columns would require those columns to be in C_W. Similarly for black.

Wait, but in the case where the

---------------

 white rectangle is R_W={row}, C_W=∅, then the white rectangle is empty. But you could choose to fill

---------------

 that row with white in some columns. However, since the maximal condition requires that you can't add any more chips, that

---------------

 would mean that the row must be either completely filled with white or not. If you have a white rectangle that uses a row but no columns, you're not using that row,

---------------

 so you could add chips in that row's columns. Therefore, such a configuration is not maximal.

Ah! This is the key point I missed earlier. The maximal condition requires that the arrangement is such that you cannot add any more chips. Therefore, any row that is partially filled must be completely filled. Similarly

---------------

 for columns. Therefore, the white and black rectangles must be such that every row in R_W is completely filled with white in all columns of C_W, and any

---------------

 column in C_W is completely filled in all rows of R_W. Additionally, the rows in R_W cannot have any other chips outside C_W, because otherwise you could add more white chips there. Wait no, the

---------------

 maximal condition requires that you cannot add any chips anywhere.

Therefore, the maximal condition imposes that the white and black rectangles must be such that:

- For every row in R_W, all columns in C_W must have a white chip (so the row is fully filled in those columns), and the

---------------

 row cannot have any chips outside C_W (because otherwise, those would have to be white as well, but since the column isn't in C_W, it

---------------

 would have to be empty or part of another rectangle).

Wait this is getting too convoluted again. Perhaps the maximal condition requires that the

---------------

 white and black regions are as large as possible. Hence, the white rectangle must use all possible rows and columns that can be white

---------------

 without conflicting with black. Therefore, the white rectangle is determined by choosing any subset of rows and columns, but with the condition that the

---------------

 black rectangle cannot use those rows or columns. But the maximal condition requires that the white and black regions are as large as possible given their non

---------------

-overlapping constraints. Therefore, the only way to satisfy maximal is that the white and black regions are as large as possible,

---------------

 which would mean that the white and black regions are any pair of non-overlapping rectangles, but the arrangement must be maximal in

---------------

 the sense that you can't expand either rectangle without overlapping.

Wait, perhaps the correct way to model it is that the white and black regions must form a partition of the grid's rows and columns into white, black, and empty such that:

- The white region is a rectangle using

---------------

 some rows and columns,

- The black region is another rectangle using the remaining rows and columns not used by white.

Wait, no, because they could both

---------------

 leave some rows and columns empty.

Alternatively, the maximal condition requires that for every row not in B_rows or W_rows, it must be empty (i.e., cannot

---------------

 have any chips). Similarly for columns. Because otherwise, if a row is not in W_rows or B_rows, it's an empty row, so you could add chips there as

---------------

 long as they don't conflict.

Wait, this is really tough. Let's try to re-express the problem with the maximal condition properly.

Maximal means that you cannot add any chip anywhere on the grid without violating the row or column color constraints. So for any empty cell (i,j), either

---------------

:

- Row i has both white and black chips, which is impossible because all chips in the row must be the same color.

Wait no, if the row has no

---------------

 chips, then you could add a chip of any color, but the column would constrain it.

Actually, to block adding a white chip to (i,j), either:

- The row i has at least one black chip (so cannot add white),

- The column j has at least one black chip (same),

- The row i is full with white (so cannot add more),

- The column j is full with white (so cannot add more).

But to

---------------

 block both white and black, you need:

Either the row i is full (any color) or the column j is full (any color), or the row and column have conflicting colors.

Wait, to

---------------

 block both colors:

If you want to place a white chip at (i,j), you need row i to be all white or empty, and column j to be all white or empty. To block this, at least one of row

---------------

 i has a black chip or column j has a black chip, or row i is full with non-white, etc.

This is too vague. Maybe the

---------------

 only way to make it maximal is that every row is completely filled with one color or empty, and every column is completely filled with one color or empty, and their

---------------

 intersections are consistent.

Thus, the only way to satisfy maximal is that the white and black regions are as I thought before: choosing

---------------

 subsets R_W, C_W, R_B, C_B with the constraints, and the total number is indeed the sum over all white

---------------

 rectangles of the number of black rectangles not sharing their rows or columns. However, the maximal condition requires that the white and black regions are as large as possible, so that

---------------

 you can't extend them. Therefore, the count is correct as per the formula, but in the 1x1 example, it over

---------------

counts because some configurations are not maximal.

Wait in the 1x1 case, the formula counts 9, but maximal arrangements are those where you can't add any more chips. The possible maximal arrangements are:

- Empty grid: you can add a white or black chip, so it's not maximal.

- White chip: maximal, because adding a black is impossible.

- Black chip: maximal, same.

Therefore only 2 maximal arrangements. But the formula counts

---------------

 9? Wait no, in the previous calculation with the formula, when we considered the 1x1 case, the total was 5 (

---------------

from the sum over white rectangles of the possible black rectangles), but that was still overcounting. Maybe the maximal condition requires that the entire arrangement

---------------

 cannot have any additional chips, so the empty grid is not maximal. Thus in 1x1, the maximal arrangements are the

---------------

 two filled ones, so answer is 2. But according to the formula:

If we require that the total white and black cells form

---------------

 a maximal arrangement (i.e., you can't add any more), then the empty grid is not counted because you can add a chip. So we

---------------

 need to subtract the cases where the arrangement is not maximal.

Wait this is getting too involved. Perhaps the correct approach is to consider

---------------

 that the maximal condition requires that every row is either fully white, fully black, or fully empty, and similarly for columns, with the color

---------------

 assignments such that there are no conflicting colors in the intersections. Then the number of such arrangements is equal to the number of ways to assign each row to W, B, or E, and each column to W, B, or E, with the constraints that:



---------------

- If a row is W, then all its columns must be either W or E (but E columns would require the cell to be empty, conflicting with the row's W). Wait this is the

---------------

 same problem as before.

Alternatively, the maximal condition requires that every row and column is fully colored (W or B) or empty, and the coloring

---------------

 is consistent.

Therefore the number is equal to the number of pairs of subsets (W_rows, W_cols) and (B_rows, B_cols) such that:

- W_rows and B_rows are disjoint,

- W_cols and B_cols are disjoint,

- The white region is W_rows × W_cols,

- The black region is B_rows × B_cols,

- Additionally, the

---------------

 white and black regions cannot be expanded: i.e., there is no row outside W_rows and B_rows that can be added to W_rows or B_rows without conflict, and similarly for columns.

Wait, but

---------------

 if a row is empty (not in W or B), then it can potentially be filled with chips as long as they don't conflict with existing columns. To

---------------

 make it maximal, such rows must be entirely empty. Because if a row is empty (not in W or B), you could add chips to it provided

---------------

 the columns allow it. Therefore, to be maximal, all empty rows must have at least one column in both W_cols and B_cols? No, I

---------------

'm confused again.

Perhaps the correct answer is indeed 3^5 × 3^5 minus the non-maximal cases, but this seems intractable.

Alternatively, let

---------------

's consider that for the grid to be maximal, every row and column must be either fully colored (W or B) or empty

---------------

, and that the coloring is consistent. The total number of such colorings is 3^5 × 3^5, but subtract those that are not maximal.

A coloring is non-maximal if there exists an empty cell where you can place a chip. To place a chip at (i,j), the row i must be empty

---------------

 or of the same color as the chip, and column j similarly. So to be non-maximal, there exists a cell (i,j) where row i is empty or its

---------------

 color is C, column j is empty or its color is C, and C is either W or B.

This is too complex to subtract.

Perhaps the

---------------

 only maximal colorings are those where every empty row is entirely empty (i.e., not in W or B rows), and every empty column is entirely empty (not in W or B columns). Thus

---------------

 the white and black regions form a partition of the grid's rows and columns into W, B, and E, with the additional

---------------

 condition that any row in E has all its columns in E (otherwise you could add a chip there). Similarly for columns.

Wait this is getting too tangled

---------------

. Maybe the correct answer is 3^5 × 3^5 - 1 (subtracting the all-empty case),

---------------

 but no, that's not right.

Alternatively, returning to the initial idea where each row and column is W, B, or E, with W and B disjoint for

---------------

 rows and columns, the total number of colorings is 3^5 × 3^5, but subtract those where you can add a chip. But

---------------

 this is too hard.

Perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the maximal arrangements correspond exactly to choosing a subset of rows and columns for white and black such that they don’t overlap, and the white

---------------

 and black regions are as described. The count is then the number of such pairs, which is indeed (sum_{k=0}^5 C(5,k) * 2^{5 -k}) )^2 = (243)^2 = 59049. But in the 1x1 case, this gives 9, but the correct maximal count is 2 (white or black filled). So

---------------

 discrepancy.

Wait in the 1x1 case, according to this formula, the count would be:

For rows: sum_{k=0}^1 C(1,k)*2^{1−k} = C(1,0)*2^1 + C(1,1)*2^0 = 2 + 1 =3.

Similarly for columns. Total 3×3=9.

But maximal arrangements are only 2 (white or black filled). The other cases are:

- Both white and black empty

---------------

: non-maximal.

- White empty, black empty: same.

- White empty, black filled: maximal.

- White filled, black empty: maximal.

- White empty

---------------

, black partially? No.

Wait actually, in the formula, the pair where white is empty and black is empty is counted, but it's non-maximal. The pair where white is empty and black is the cell is counted. Similarly white is the cell and black is empty. The

---------------

 other cases in the formula correspond to white and black rectangles that overlap? No, in 1x1:

When white is assigned

---------------

 to row and column, black can only be empty. So that's one case (white filled, black empty).

When white is assigned to row only (so

---------------

 white rectangle is empty), then black can be assigned to column only (black rectangle empty) or to row and column (black filled). Thus two

---------------

 cases: black empty or filled.

Similarly for white assigned to column only: similar to row only.

And white assigned to neither: black can be anything.

Thus the formula counts all these

---------------

, but the maximal arrangements are only the ones where either white or black is filled (the other empty), or both are empty? No, both empty is non-maximal.

Thus total

---------------

 maximal arrangements are 2 (white or black filled), but the formula counts:

- White filled, black empty: 1.

- White empty, black filled:1.

- All

---------------

 others (like white empty and black empty): non-maximal.

- Other assignments where white or black are partially defined but the

---------------

 actual cell is empty (like white has row but no column, etc.), but those are non-maximal.

Therefore, the formula counts 

---------------

9 total, but only 2 are maximal. So the formula is not the right approach.

Perhaps the correct way is to realize

---------------

 that in order for the arrangement to be maximal, the white and black regions must be as large as possible. Thus, the

---------------

 white region must be the maximal possible rectangle given its rows and columns, and similarly for black. Therefore, the white region must be the intersection of all rows that are white and columns that are white, and similarly for black. Thus

---------------

, the white and black regions are determined by choosing W_rows and W_cols, and B_rows and B_cols such that they are disjoint, and the regions are as

---------------

 large as possible. Therefore, the only maximal arrangements are those where:

- The white region is W_rows × W_cols,

- The black region is B_rows × B_cols,

- W

---------------

_rows and B_rows are disjoint,

- W_cols and B_cols are disjoint,

- Additionally, there are no remaining rows or columns that can be added to W or B without overlapping.

This last condition means that every row not in W_rows or B_rows must be entirely empty (otherwise

---------------

 you could add it to W or B), and similarly for columns.

Thus, the maximal arrangements are exactly those where the white and black regions partition the grid's rows and columns into W, B, and E such that:

- All rows in W_rows are entirely white in W_cols and empty elsewhere.

- All rows in B_rows are entirely black in B_cols and empty elsewhere.

- All rows in E_rows are entirely empty.

- Similarly for columns.

Thus, the number

---------------

 of such arrangements is equal to the number of ways to partition the rows into W_rows, B_rows, E_rows and the columns into W_cols, B_cols, E_cols with the following conditions:

- W_rows and B_rows are disjoint,

- W_cols and B_cols are disjoint,

- Additionally, any

---------------

 row in E_rows must have all its columns in E_cols or in both W_cols and B_cols? No, actually:

If

---------------

 a row is in E_rows, then it cannot have any chips. Thus, all columns in that row must be either in E_cols (so the

---------------

 column is empty) or in W_cols or B_cols but the cell is empty.

Wait no, if a row is in E_rows, it can't have any chips. So for any column in W_cols, the cell at (E_row, W_col) must be empty. But W_col is supposed to be white

---------------

 for W_rows, but for E_rows, it must be empty. Therefore, the columns in W_cols must be entirely white in W_rows and empty in other rows. Similarly, columns in B_cols must be entirely black in B_rows and empty elsewhere.

Thus, the partition

---------------

 must satisfy:

- W_rows × W_cols is the white region,

- B_rows × B_cols is the black region,

- All other cells are empty.

Therefore

---------------

, this is exactly the same as the initial model where we choose any subsets W_rows, W_cols, B_rows, B_cols with W_rows ∩ B_rows = ∅ and W_cols ∩ B_cols = ∅. Each such choice defines a valid maximal arrangement. The only

---------------

 difference is that the empty rows and columns are those not in W/B rows/cols.

Therefore, the total number of arrangements is indeed the number of such quadr

---------------

uples (W_rows, W_cols, B_rows, B_cols) with the disjointness conditions, which is:

For each row, choose whether it is W, B, or E (3 choices).

For each column, choose whether it is W, B, or E (3 choices).

The

---------------

 total is 3^5 × 3^5 = 3^10 = 59049.

However, this includes the case where both white and black regions are empty (all rows and columns are E), which is not maximal because you can add a chip. Therefore

---------------

 we must subtract that one case.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "some of these chips", so the empty arrangement is allowed as

---------------

 long as it's maximal. But the empty arrangement is not maximal because you can add a chip. So the total number should be 3^10 -1.

But in the 1x1 case, this would give 9-1=8, which is still wrong because the correct maximal arrangements are 2.

Hmm

---------------

, clearly this approach is not working. Maybe I need to think differently.

Alternative approach inspired by the problem's conditions:

Each row is either all white, all black, or empty.

Each column is either all white, all black, or empty.

Additionally, for every empty cell (i,j), there

---------------

 exists at least one direction (row or column) that is already filled with the opposite color or is filled with the same color but can

---------------

't take more.

Wait, the maximal condition implies that every empty cell must be in a row that is already of the opposite color or the

---------------

 row is full of the same color, or similarly for the column.

Wait, more precisely, for any empty cell (i,j), you

---------------

 cannot place a white chip there unless the row is white or empty and the column is white or empty. To prevent placing a white chip, at least one of the following must be true:

- The row i is black (so can't place white),

- The column j is black,

- The row i is full with white,

- The column j is full with white.

Similarly for black.

To block

---------------

 both colors, you need that for any empty cell (i,j):

Either:

- The row is black and column is black (so can't place either),

- Or the row is full white and column is full black (conf

---------------

lict),

Wait, this is too vague. Perhaps the maximal condition requires that every row is either fully white, fully black, or fully empty, and similarly for columns, with the added

---------------

 condition that any empty row must have at least one column in both white and black columns, so you can't add a chip.



---------------

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another way.

Another idea: since the problem requires that all chips in a row/column are the same color, and the arrangement is maximal, then every row and column is either:



---------------

- Fully white,

- Fully black,

- Or, if empty, then every column in that row must be either fully white or fully black (

---------------

so you can't add any chips to the row without conflicting with a column's color).

Wait, if a row is empty, then for every column in that row:

- If the column is white, then you could place a white chip there, unless the row is already white

---------------

.

- If the column is black, similarly.

- If the column is empty, then you could place either.

Therefore, to make the row empty maximal, all columns must be either white or black, so that you can't add any chips to the row.

Similarly for columns.

Thus, the conditions are:

- Every row is either fully white, fully black, or fully

---------------

 empty, with the added condition that if a row is empty, then every column must be fully white or fully black (so no column is empty).

- Similarly, every column is either fully white, fully black, or fully empty, with the added condition that if a column is empty, then every row must be fully white or fully black.

Wait, this is reciprocal

---------------

.

Therefore, the entire grid must be partitioned into white rows/columns, black rows/columns, and the remaining rows and columns must be such

---------------

 that:

- If a row is empty, all its columns are non-empty (either white or black).

- If a column is empty, all its rows are non-empty (either white or black).

This is quite

---------------

 restrictive.

Let me consider that the grid is divided into four regions:

1. White region: rows W and columns W,



---------------

2. Black region: rows B and columns B,

3. The remaining rows (not W or B) must have all their columns in W or B (so they

---------------

 are empty rows),

4. The remaining columns (not W or B) must have all their rows in W or B (so they are empty columns).

Therefore, the white

---------------

 and black regions form a partition of the grid's rows and columns such that:

- The white rows and columns form a rectangle of white chips.

- The black rows and columns form a rectangle of black chips.

- The remaining rows and columns are empty, but they

---------------

 must not have any "free" columns or rows that could allow adding a chip.

Thus, the white and black regions must form a partition where:

- The non

---------------

-white and non-black rows are exactly those that have all their columns in white or black regions.

- Similarly for columns.

This implies

---------------

 that the white and black regions must form a "rectangle" that covers all rows and columns except those fully in the opposite region.

Wait, this is getting

---------------

 too abstract. Perhaps the only way this can happen is that the white and black regions are such that:

- The set of white rows and black rows form a partition of the rows (no

---------------

 overlap),

- Similarly for columns,

- And the white columns and black columns also form a partition of the columns.

Wait, if

---------------

 that's the case, then the white and black regions are non-overlapping in both rows and columns, and cover all rows and columns. Thus

---------------

 the entire grid is divided into four regions:

- W_rows × W_cols: white,

- B_rows × B_cols: black,

- W_rows × B_cols: empty (since column

---------------

 is B and row is W),

- B_rows × W_cols: empty,

- The remaining cells would be E_rows and E_cols, but if all rows are W

---------------

 or B and all columns are W or B, then there are no E rows or columns.

Wait, so if we require that every row is either W or B, and every column is either W or B, then the grid

---------------

 is divided into four regions as above, and the arrangement is maximal because any empty cell is in a conflicting row/column pair.

In

---------------

 this case, the number of such arrangements is the number of ways to choose W_rows subset of rows, B_rows = complement of W_rows,

Similarly W_cols subset of columns, B_cols = complement of W_cols,

Then the white region is W_rows × W_cols,

Black region is B_rows × B_cols,

And

---------------

 the total number is (2^5 -1)^2. Because for rows, we choose a non-empty subset for W_rows (since if W_rows is empty, then all rows are B, and

---------------

 similarly for columns). Wait no:

Actually, W_rows can be any subset (including empty), and B_rows is its complement. Similarly for columns.

Therefore

---------------

, the number of such arrangements is (2^5) × (2^5) = 1024. But this counts all possible ways

---------------

 to partition rows into W and B, and columns into W and B. Each such partition defines a unique maximal arrangement where white is W_rows×W_cols and black is B_rows×B_cols. However, this includes cases where W_rows or W_cols are empty, leading to one

---------------

 of the regions being empty.

But the problem allows using any number of chips, including zero of one color. However, the maximal condition is satisfied in all these cases.

For example, if W_rows is all rows and W_cols is all columns, then black region is empty, and it's a maximal arrangement (all

---------------

 white). Similarly if W is empty, then it's all black. If both are empty, it's all empty, but that's not maximal. Wait, if both W_rows and W_cols are empty, then white

---------------

 region is empty, black region is all rows and columns, so it's all black. Wait no, if W_rows is empty, then B_rows is all rows. If W_cols is empty, then B_cols is all columns. So black region is all rows × all columns = entire grid, so it

---------------

's all black.

Wait actually, if we allow W_rows to be any subset (including empty), and similarly for columns, then the total

---------------

 is indeed 2^5 × 2^5 = 1024. But this includes the case where W_rows and W_cols are both empty, which results in the entire grid being black (maximal). The case where both W_rows and W_cols are all

---------------

, resulting in entire grid white. The case where W_rows is all and W_cols is empty gives white region empty and black region all, so entire grid black. E

---------------

tc.

However, what about the case where W_rows is non-empty but W_cols is empty? Then the white region is W_rows × empty = empty, and black region is all

---------------

 rows (since B_rows is empty complement) × all columns (since B_cols is complement of W_cols which is empty). So black region is entire grid. So that

---------------

's counted in the 1024.

But what about the case where W_rows and W_cols are both empty? That gives

---------------

 black region as entire grid, which is valid.

The only case not maximal is when both white and black regions are empty? No, because if both W_rows and W_cols are empty, then white is empty, and black is entire grid, which is maximal.

Wait the only non-maximal case would be if both white and black regions are empty, but that's impossible because then

---------------

 all rows and columns are neither W nor B, which contradicts the partition.

Actually, in this model every possible partition of

---------------

 rows and columns into W and B (with complements) gives a maximal arrangement. Therefore the total is 2^5 × 2^5 = 1024. But the problem states

---------------

 there are 25 white and 25 black chips, but in this model, you can have more than 25 chips of one color. For example, if W_rows is all 5 rows and W_cols is all 5 columns, then white region is 25 chips. Similarly for black. So it

---------------

's okay.

But wait in the problem, you have 25 white and 25 black chips available, but you can use any number up

---------------

 to that. So this model counts all possible such maximal arrangements, even those that use fewer chips, as long as they are maximal.

Therefore

---------------

, the answer should be 1024. But let me check with the 1x1 case:

For a 1x1 grid, this model gives 2^1 × 2^1 =4 arrangements

---------------

:

- W_rows = {row}, W_cols = {col}: white filled.

- W_rows = {row}, W_cols = {}: black filled.

- W_rows = {}, W_cols = {col}: black filled.

- W_rows = {}, W_cols = {}: black filled (since B_rows

---------------

 and B_cols are all).

Wait, no:

Wait, in the 1x1 case:

Each W_rows can be either {

---------------

row} or empty.

Similarly W_cols can be {col} or empty.

The four possibilities:

1. W_rows={row}, W_cols={col}: white filled

---------------

.

2. W_rows={row}, W_cols=empty: white region is empty. B_rows=empty (complement), B_cols={col}. So black region is empty×{col}= empty. Wait no, B_rows is the complement of W_rows,

---------------

 which is empty. So B_rows is empty. B_cols is complement of W_cols (which is empty), so B_cols is {col}. Thus black region is B_rows×B_cols = empty×{col}= empty. So the entire

---------------

 grid is empty? That can't be.

Wait this is the problem. If W_rows is {row}, then B_rows is empty. If W_cols is empty, then B_cols is {col}. Thus the black region is B_rows (empty) × B_cols ({col}) = empty. The white region is W_rows × W_cols = {row} × empty = empty. So the entire grid is empty, which is not maximal. But according to the model, this case is counted but

---------------

 it's non-maximal.

Ah, so this model counts some non-maximal arrangements. Specifically, when W_rows and W_cols are not

---------------

 both chosen or not.

Thus, the model overcounts by including cases where the white and black regions are both empty, leading to an empty grid which is not maximal.

To

---------------

 fix this, we must ensure that at least one of the regions is non-empty. Or alternatively, require that the union of white and black regions covers the entire grid?

---------------

 No, because the empty regions are allowed as long as they can't have chips added.

Wait the issue in the 1x1 case is that when W_rows and W_cols are not

---------------

 both selected, the resulting regions can be empty even if individual regions are not. For example, choosing W_rows={row} and W_cols=empty gives white region empty and black region also empty because B_rows is empty. Thus

---------------

 the grid is empty, which is invalid.

Therefore, to ensure maximality, the arrangement must have either white region non-empty or black region non-empty, but not

---------------

 both being empty. However, even that isn't sufficient because the empty grid is counted when both are empty.

Therefore, the correct count is (2^5 × 2^5) -1 = 1023, subtracting the all-empty case. But in the 1x1 case this gives 3, which is still incorrect because the maximal arrangements are 2.

Wait

---------------

 in 1x1:

The four possibilities from the model:

1. W_rows and W_cols both {row, col}: white filled. Maximal.

2. W_rows {row}, W_cols empty: results

---------------

 in empty grid. Not maximal.

3. W_rows empty, W_cols {col}: results in empty grid. Not maximal.

4. Both empty: empty grid. Not maximal.

Thus only the first case is maximal, but according to 2^2 -1 = 3, we

---------------

 would have 3, but actually only 1 is maximal. So still discrepancy.

Alternatively, the correct model requires that the white and black regions are

---------------

 such that their union covers all rows and columns. That is, every row is in W or B, and every column is in W or B. Thus

---------------

, there are no E rows or columns. In this case, the white and black regions partition the grid into four parts as before, and the entire

---------------

 grid is covered by white and black regions and their cross terms (which are empty).

This would mean that W_rows and B_rows partition the rows, and similarly columns. Thus the number is (2^5 -1)*(2^5 -1). Because we need

---------------

 to choose non-empty W_rows and W_cols? No, because you can have all rows as W and none as B, or

---------------

 vice versa.

Actually, the number of ways to partition rows into W and B is 2^5 (each row can be W or B). Similarly for columns. But

---------------

 to exclude the case where all rows are B and all columns are B (leading to empty grid?), no.

Wait if you allow W_rows and B_rows to be any subsets (including empty), but require that every row is W or B, similarly

---------------

 columns, then it's 2^5 × 2^5 = 1024, but this includes the case where all are B, leading to empty

---------------

 white region and black region being all rows and columns, which is maximal. Similarly all W.

The only non-maximal case is when both W and B regions are empty, but that's impossible since every row and column is either W or B. The only way both regions are empty is if there are no rows or columns, which isn't the case.

Thus, in

---------------

 this model, every such partition corresponds to a maximal arrangement. The problem in the 1x1 case is that when you choose W_rows={row} and W_cols=empty, then B

---------------

_rows is empty (so all rows are B?), no:

Wait, if rows are partitioned into W and B, then if

---------------

 W_rows is {row}, B_rows is empty. Thus all rows are W or B. Similarly, if W_cols is empty, then B_cols is all columns.

Thus the black region is B_rows × B_cols = empty × {col} = empty. The white region is W_rows × W_cols = {row} × empty = empty. Thus the entire grid is empty, which is not maximal. But according to the partition, every row and column is assigned to W or B, but the regions don

---------------

't cover the grid. Because the regions are W×W and B×B, but if W_rows and B_cols are non

---------------

-overlapping, the actual filled cells are W×W and B×B.

Wait in the 1x1 case with W_rows={row}, W_cols=empty:

- W×W is empty,

- B×B is (complement of W_rows is

---------------

 empty) × (complement of W_cols is {col}) → empty × {col} = empty.

Thus the grid is empty, even though every row and column is assigned to W or B. The

---------------

 problem is that the regions defined by W×W and B×B are empty. To prevent this, we must require that both

---------------

 W_rows and W_cols are non-empty to have a white region, or similarly for black.

Thus, the correct count is the number of pairs (W_rows, W_cols, B_rows, B_cols) where:

- W_rows and B_rows partition the rows,

- W_cols and B_cols partition the columns,

- and

---------------

 the union of white and black regions covers the grid? Not sure.

Alternatively, the total number is the number of ways to choose W_rows and W_cols (any subsets), and then B_rows and B_cols are their complements, but subtract

---------------

 the cases where both white and black regions are empty.

The number of such arrangements is 2^5 × 2^5 - 1 = 1023 (subtracting the case where both regions are empty, which occurs when W_rows and W_cols are both empty, leading to black regions also empty?

---------------

 No.

Wait when W_rows and W_cols are both empty, then B_rows and B_cols are all rows and columns, so the black region is all rows × all columns = the entire grid. Thus that case is counted and is maximal.

The only case where the entire grid is empty is when both white and black regions are empty, which requires that W_rows ×

---------------

 W_cols is empty AND B_rows × B_cols is empty. That happens only if:

- W_rows × W_cols is empty ⇒ either W_rows or W_cols is empty.

- B_rows × B_cols is empty ⇒ either B_rows or B_cols is empty.

But since B_rows is the complement of W_rows, and B_cols is the complement of W_cols:

- If W_rows is empty, then B_rows is all rows. For B_rows × B_cols to be empty, B_cols must be empty ⇒ W_cols must be all columns. Thus W

---------------

_rows is empty and W_cols is all columns ⇒ white region is empty × all columns = empty. Black region is all rows × B_cols (which is empty) ⇒ empty. So the grid is empty.

Similarly, if W_cols is empty and W_rows is all rows, then similarly

---------------

.

Thus, there are two cases where the grid is empty:

1. W_rows is empty and W_cols is all columns.

2. W_cols is empty and W_rows is all rows.

Plus the case where both W_rows and W_cols are empty:



---------------

- W_rows empty and W_cols empty ⇒ B_rows all rows, B_cols all columns ⇒ black region is all × all ⇒ filled

---------------

 black, not empty.

Thus only two cases where the grid is empty:

- W_rows empty, W_cols all columns.

- W_cols empty, W_rows all rows.

Therefore, to get maximal arrangements, we need to subtract these two cases from the total 1024, giving 1022.

In the 1x1 case:

Total is 4, subtract the two cases where grid is empty (W_rows={

---------------

row}, W_cols empty and W_cols={col}, W_rows empty), giving 2, which matches the correct answer.

Therefore, the general formula is:

Total arrangements = (2^n × 2^n) - 2*(2^{n-1}),

Wait let

---------------

 me see for n=5:

Total is 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024.

Number of cases

---------------

 where grid is empty: ?

In general, the number of ways to have an empty grid is the number of ways where:

Either:

- W_rows is empty and W_cols is all columns,

- Or W_cols is empty and W_rows is all rows.

Number

---------------

 of such cases:

For the first case: W_rows must be empty (1 way), W_cols must be all columns (1 way).

For the second case: W_cols empty (1 way), W_rows all rows (1 way).

Thus total 2 cases.

Therefore, total maximal arrangements are 2^{2n} - 2.

For n=5: 1024 - 2 = 1022.

For n=1: 4-2=2, which matches.

Thus the answer should be 1022.

Wait but let me confirm with another small case, say n=2.

For a 2x2 grid:

Total arrangements would

---------------

 be 2^2 * 2^2 = 16.

Subtract 2 cases where grid is empty:



---------------

Thus 14.

Let me enumerate them:

Possible maximal arrangements are all except the two cases where the grid is empty.

Each maximal arrangement is either:

- All white,

- All black,

- A

---------------

 mix where the white and black regions form non-overlapping rectangles.

For example, choosing W_rows={row1}, W_cols={col1}, then white region is (row1, col1). The black region is B_rows={row2}, B_cols={col2}, so black cell at (row2, col2). The other cells are empty but can't be filled because:



---------------

- (row1, col2): row1 is white, column2 is black ⇒ can't place anything.

- (row2, col1): row2 is black, column1 is white ⇒ can't place anything.

Thus this is a valid maximal arrangement with two chips.

There are many such possibilities.

The total should

---------------

 indeed be 14.

Therefore, the formula seems correct.

Thus, for the 5x5 grid, the answer is 2^{10} - 2 = 1024 -2 = 1022.

Wait but the problem says "some of these chips", which includes the cases where all are white or all are black. Those

---------------

 are included in the count.

But wait in the formula, the two subtracted cases are the ones where the grid is entirely empty (two

---------------

 cases), but the all-white and all-black are allowed.

Thus, the final answer is 1022.

However, the problem states

---------------

 that there are 25 white and 25 black chips available. The maximal arrangement might require more than 25 chips of one color? For example, if you

---------------

 choose all rows and columns as white, that uses 25 white chips, which is allowed. Similarly for black. So

---------------

 it's okay.

Thus, the number of maximal arrangements is 2^{10} -2 =1022.

Wait but let

---------------

 me think again about the two subtracted cases:

The two cases where the grid is empty are when:

1. W_rows is empty and W_cols is all columns (

---------------

so black region is B_rows=all rows × B_cols=empty ⇒ black region is empty, resulting in empty grid).

2. W_cols is empty and W_rows is all rows (so black region is B_rows=empty × B_cols=all columns ⇒ empty).

These are the only two cases where the grid is empty. Thus subtracting them from the total 2^5×2^5 gives the correct count.

Therefore, the answer should be 2^{10} -2 = 1022.

But let me verify

---------------

 with the problem's constraints:

The problem requires that each cell has at most one chip, which is satisfied.

All chips in the same row and column have the same color: yes, because rows and columns are assigned to W or B.

Maximal: yes, because any empty cell is in a row or column that prevents

---------------

 adding a chip of either color.

Thus, the answer is 1022.

Wait but I'm a bit unsure because in

---------------

 the initial consideration of the problem, the white and black regions can be any non-overlapping rectangles, but according to this model they must partition the rows and columns into

---------------

 W and B with no overlap, leading to the white and black regions being in opposite corners.

But according to this model, the white

---------------

 region is W_rows × W_cols, and black is B_rows × B_cols, which are disjoint in rows and columns. Thus they

---------------

 can't overlap. The remaining cells are in W_rows × B_cols and B_rows × W_cols, which are empty and

---------------

 cannot have chips.

Therefore, the count is correct.

Thus, I think the correct answer is 1022.

Wait but let

---------------

 me see another way. The number of ways to choose W_rows is 2^5, same for W_cols. Each

---------------

 such choice defines a unique arrangement, except the two cases where the grid is empty. Therefore total is 2^5×2^5 -2 = 1024 -2=1022.

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{1022}.


To solve the problem of finding the number of ways to place some of the 25 white and 25 black chips in a 5×5 grid such that each row and column has chips of the same color and the arrangement is maximal, we can model the grid using the

---------------

 following approach:

1. **Maximal Condition**: The arrangement must be such that no additional chips can be placed without violating the row or column color constraints. This implies that every row and column must be either completely filled with one color (white or black) or completely empty. Additionally, any empty cell must be in a row or column that is already filled with the opposite color or cannot accept any more chips.

2. **Partitioning Rows and Columns**: Each row can be assigned to either white (W), black (B), or empty (E). Similarly, each column can be assigned to W, B, or E. However, to ensure maximality, the rows and columns must be partitioned such that:
   - If

---------------

 a row is assigned to W, all its columns must be either W or E (but E columns would require the cell to be empty).
   - If a column is assigned to W, all its rows must be either W or E (similar logic for B).

3. **Non-Overlapping Regions**: The white region (W_rows × W_cols) and black region (B_rows × B_cols) must not overlap in rows or columns. This means W_rows and B_rows must be disjoint, and W_cols and B_cols must be disjoint.

4. **Counting Configurations**: The total number of ways to assign rows and columns to W, B, or E is \(3^5 \times 3^5\). However, we need to subtract the cases where the grid is entirely empty, which are counted

---------------

 twice (once when W_rows are all rows and W_cols are empty, and once when W_cols are all columns and W_rows are empty).

5. **Final Calculation**: The total number of valid configurations is calculated as:
   \[
   2^5 \times 2^5 - 2 = 1024 - 2 = 1022
   \]
   This accounts for all possible partitions of rows and columns into W and B, excluding the two cases where the grid is entirely empty.

Thus, the number of ways to place the chips under the given conditions is \(\boxed{1022}\).<|im_end|>
