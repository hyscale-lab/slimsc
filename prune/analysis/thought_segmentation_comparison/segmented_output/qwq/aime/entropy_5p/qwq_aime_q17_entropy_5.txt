Okay, let's tackle this problem about finding the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon where each side of the rectangle lies on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, first

---------------

, I need to recall what a regular dodecagon is—a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees, right? Because the formula for internal angles is (n-2)*180/n, so (12-2)*180/12 = 150. 

Now, the problem is about rectangles formed by sides or diagonals. Since

---------------

 a rectangle has four right angles (90 degrees), the sides of the rectangle must lie along lines that form 90-degree angles with each other. But

---------------

 in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals form various angles. So, I need to figure out how the

---------------

 sides and diagonals can form rectangles.

First, maybe I should consider the symmetry of the dodecagon. Since it's regular, it has rotational and reflectional symmetry. Each

---------------

 vertex is spaced 30 degrees apart because 360/12 = 30. So, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 30 degrees. 

Let

---------------

 me think about the diagonals. In a regular polygon, diagonals can be of different lengths depending on how many vertices they skip. For a dodecagon, the diagonals can be categorized by how many edges they skip. For example, a diagonal that skips one vertex is adjacent

---------------

 to the side, but actually, that would just be the side itself. Wait, no. The sides are edges, so diagonals are connections between non-adjacent vertices. So the diagon

---------------

als can be of different lengths. Let me see:

In a regular n-gon, the length of a diagonal can be determined by the number of vertices it skips. For a dodecagon (n=12), the diagonals can be categorized by the step between vertices, from 2 to 10 (since skipping

---------------

 1 is the side itself, and skipping more than n/2 would be the same as the shorter path in the other direction). So

---------------

 steps from 2 to 6 (since beyond that, it's symmetric). 

Each step corresponds to a certain angle. The angle between two vertices connected

---------------

 by a diagonal of step k would be (k)*30 degrees at the center. Wait, actually, the central angle between two vertices is 360/12 = 30 degrees per step. So, if you skip k steps, the central angle is 30k degrees. 

So

---------------

, the length of the diagonal is related to the central angle. But perhaps more importantly for forming rectangles, the sides of the rectangle must be perpendicular. So, if

---------------

 two diagonals form adjacent sides of a rectangle, their corresponding central angles must add up to 90 degrees? Hmm, maybe not exactly, but perhaps

---------------

 the angles between the sides of the rectangle need to be 90 degrees. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of the rectangle's sides as being along

---------------

 chords of the dodecagon that are perpendicular. Since in the dodecagon, the chords can have various angles between them. For

---------------

 two chords to be perpendicular, the angle between them (the angle between their respective central angles?) must be 90 degrees? Wait

---------------

, maybe the angle between the chords at their intersection point must be 90 degrees. But since the rectangle's sides are chords

---------------

, their intersection must form right angles. 

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of coordinates. Let me try that. If I place the dodecagon on a coordinate system with its center at the origin and one vertex at (1,0), then each vertex can be represented in polar coordinates as (r, 30°*k) where k is from 0 to 11, and r is the radius. 



---------------

Suppose the dodecagon is unit radius for simplicity. Then each vertex is at angle 30°*k. Let

---------------

 me note that the coordinates of the vertices can be written as (cos(θ), sin(θ)) where θ = 0°, 30°, 60°, ..., 330°. 

A rectangle requires four points such that the sides are pairs of perpendicular

---------------

 vectors. So, if we have four points A, B, C, D forming a rectangle, then the vectors AB and AD must be perpendicular, and vectors

---------------

 AB and DC must be equal, etc. Alternatively, the rectangle can be determined by two pairs of parallel and perpendicular vectors. 

Alternatively, perhaps another

---------------

 approach is to consider that in order to form a rectangle, we need two pairs of parallel chords which are perpendicular to each other. Each

---------------

 pair of opposite sides of the rectangle must be parallel and equal in length, and the sides must be perpendicular. 

Therefore, perhaps

---------------

 the strategy is to find all pairs of perpendicular chords that can form sides of rectangles. Then, for each such pair, determine how many rectangles can be formed by their

---------------

 intersections or placements.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that a rectangle is determined by two pairs of parallel lines (the sides) which are perpendicular. In the dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can form such pairs. 

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 we can think of selecting two pairs of parallel sides/diagonals, each pair perpendicular to each other, and then count

---------------

 how many such rectangles can be formed by their intersections.

But how do we determine which diagonals are perpendicular?

First, let

---------------

 me recall that in a regular polygon, two chords are perpendicular if the difference between their angles is 90°, or

---------------

 equivalently, the central angles between their respective vertices differ by 90°, but I might need to think more carefully.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the direction of the chord (the angle it makes with the horizontal axis) is related to the angle of the vertices. Let me think.

---------------

 For a chord connecting two vertices separated by k steps, the angle of the chord can be considered as the angle bisector between the two vertices. 



---------------

Suppose we have two vertices at angles θ and θ + 30°*k. The chord between them will have a direction angle

---------------

 of θ + 15°*k. Because the chord is between two points separated by k steps (each step 30°), so the midpoint angle

---------------

 is θ + 15°*k. Therefore, the direction of the chord is θ + 15°*k. 

Therefore, for two chords to be perpendicular, the difference between their direction angles should be 90° or 270°, but since direction is modulo 360°, the

---------------

 difference could be 90° or -90°, so effectively, the difference of 90°.

Therefore, if we have two chords with direction angles α and β, then for

---------------

 them to be perpendicular, α - β ≡ ±90° mod 360°. 

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 the angle between the two chords is 90°, which would correspond to the difference in their direction angles being 90°, but depending

---------------

 on the orientation. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the chord's slope. For two chords to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes must be -1. 



---------------

But perhaps using coordinates would be more systematic. Let me try that approach.

Let me first note that in a regular dodecagon, each vertex can be represented as (cos(30°k), sin(30°k)) for k from 0 to 11. Let me denote

---------------

 these vertices as V₀, V₁, ..., V₁₁.

Suppose we have a chord connecting V_i and V_j. The direction of this chord can be found by the angle of the vector from V_i to V_j. The

---------------

 angle of the chord (the direction it's pointing) would be the angle of the vector (V_j - V_i). 



---------------

Alternatively, since the chord is between two points, the direction of the chord is the angle of the line connecting them. To

---------------

 compute the angle of that line, we can take the angle of the vector from V_i to V_j. Let's compute

---------------

 this.

Suppose we have two vertices separated by k steps, so moving from V_i to V_{i+k}. The angle between them

---------------

 is 30°*k. The direction of the chord would be the angle of the vector from V_i to V_{i+k}.

Let me compute the direction of the chord between V₀ and V_k. Let's take

---------------

 V₀ at (1, 0). The coordinates of V_k are (cos(30k°), sin(30k°)). The vector from V₀ to V_k is (cos(30k°)-1, sin(30k°)). The direction angle θ of this vector can be found via arctangent of (sin(30k°)/(cos(30k°)-1)). Hmm, this might be complicated, but perhaps there's a better way.

Alternatively, since

---------------

 the chord is between two vertices separated by k steps, the angle of the chord can be considered as the angle bisector between the two vertices. Since

---------------

 each vertex is 30° apart, the angle between V₀ and V_k is 30°*k, so the bisector would be at 15°*k from V₀. Wait

---------------

, but that might not exactly be the direction of the chord. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle of the chord (

---------------

the slope) is the angle of the line connecting the two points. Let me compute this for a specific example. Let's take V₀ at (1,0) and V₁ at (cos30°, sin30°). The vector from V₀ to V₁ is (cos30° -1, sin30°). The angle of this vector would be arctan( (sin30°)/(cos30° -1) ). Let's compute that numerically.

cos30° ≈ 0.8660, sin30° = 0.5. So denominator

---------------

 is 0.8660 -1 ≈ -0.1340. Numerator is 0.5. So arctangent of (0.5)/(-0.134) ≈ arctan(-3.732). Since

---------------

 the x-component is negative and y is positive, the angle is in the second quadrant, so 180° - 75° = 105°, because tan(75°)=3.732. So the angle is 180-75=105°. 

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 there's a better way. Let me think of the chord between V₀ and V_k. The direction of the chord can also be thought

---------------

 of as the angle of the line connecting those two points. Since both points are on the unit circle, the chord's direction is perpendicular to the angle bisector between them. Wait, maybe?



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the angle of the chord is the angle of the line connecting the two points. For two points on a circle, the line connecting them is a chord, and its angle is determined by the midpoint

---------------

 between them. The midpoint's angle is (θ_i + θ_j)/2, and the direction of the chord is perpendicular to that?

---------------

 Wait, no. Wait, the direction of the chord is the same as the direction of the line between the two points. 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the angle of the chord (its slope) can be found by considering the angle of the chord with respect to the center. Hmm

---------------

, maybe this is getting too convoluted. Let me try another approach.

Since a rectangle must have sides that are either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon, and

---------------

 each side of the rectangle must lie along a side or a diagonal. So, perhaps we can model this by selecting four points (

---------------

vertices) such that the lines connecting them form a rectangle with all sides lying on sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 a rectangle is determined by two pairs of parallel chords, each pair being perpendicular. Each pair must consist of two chords of the same length (since opposite sides of a rectangle are equal). 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the key is to look for all possible rectangles by considering their diagonals. Wait, in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other. But here

---------------

, the sides of the rectangle have to lie on the dodecagon's sides or diagonals, so the sides themselves

---------------

 are chords of the dodecagon. 

Alternatively, maybe the rectangle's sides must be chords that are themselves sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So each side of the rectangle is either a side of the dodecagon or a diagonal (connecting non-adjacent vertices). 

So, to

---------------

 form a rectangle, we need four vertices of the dodecagon such that the sides between them are either edges or diagonals, and the angles between consecutive sides are 90 degrees. 

Alternatively, perhaps it

---------------

's easier to think of the rectangle's vertices as four points on the dodecagon such that the sides are chords forming

---------------

 right angles. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem can be approached by considering all possible quadrilaterals with vertices on the dodecagon,

---------------

 and counting those that are rectangles with edges on sides or diagonals. 

Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to consider that in a regular dodecagon, any

---------------

 rectangle must have its sides aligned along certain chords which are perpendicular. Let me see if I can find a systematic way.

Let me think

---------------

 of the regular dodecagon's structure. Since it has 12 sides, each vertex is 30 degrees apart. Let

---------------

 me list the vertices as V0 through V11, with V0 at angle 0°, V1 at 30°, V2 at 60°, etc., up to V11 at 330°.

Sup

---------------

pose I want to form a rectangle. Let me think of two pairs of parallel sides. Since the rectangle must have opposite sides equal and parallel. So

---------------

, for two sides to be parallel, the chords must be in the same direction. 

Therefore, perhaps the sides of the rectangle must be parallel

---------------

 to some direction that exists as a chord in the dodecagon. So, first, I need to find all possible directions of chords in

---------------

 the dodecagon, then see which pairs of directions are perpendicular, and then count how many rectangles can be formed for each such pair.

First step: Determine

---------------

 all possible directions of chords (sides or diagonals) in the dodecagon. Each chord is determined by two vertices, so the direction of the chord is determined by the angle between the two vertices.

Wait, but

---------------

 the direction of the chord can be measured as the angle it makes with the horizontal axis. For a chord between two vertices separated by k steps, the direction angle

---------------

 can be calculated as follows: 

Suppose the chord connects V_i and V_j, where the shorter arc between them is k steps (k from 1 to 6, since beyond that it's the same as going the other way). The central angle between them is 30°k. The direction of the chord would be the angle of the line connecting them. 



---------------

Alternatively, the direction angle of the chord is the angle bisector between the two vertices. For example, if the two vertices are separated by k steps, then the angle between them is 30°k, so the angle of the chord direction

---------------

 is the average of their angles. Wait, actually, the line connecting the two points will be perpendicular to the bisector of the central angle. 

Hmm, perhaps it

---------------

's better to think of the direction of the chord as the angle of the chord relative to the center. Let me think of the

---------------

 chord between V0 and Vk. The chord is between angle 0° and 30°k. The direction of this chord would be the angle of the line between those two points. 

Alternatively, let

---------------

's compute the slope. Let me take specific examples. 

Take chord between V0 (0°) and V1 (30°). The coordinates are (1,0) and (cos30°, sin30°). The slope is (sin30° - 0)/(cos30° - 1) ≈ (0.5)/(0.866 - 1) ≈ 0.5 / (-0.134) ≈ -3.732, so the angle is arctan(-3.732) which is in the second quadrant (since x is negative, y is positive). The

---------------

 angle from the positive x-axis is 180° - 75° = 105°, since tan(75°) ≈ 3.732. 

Similarly, the chord between V0 and V2 (60°): coordinates (1,0) and (cos60°, sin60°) = (0.5, √3/2 ≈ 0.866). The slope is (0.866 - 0)/(0.5 - 1) = 0.866 / (-0.5) ≈ -1.732. The angle here is arctan(-1.732) which is 180° - 60° = 120°, since tan(60°)=1.732. 

Continuing this way, perhaps

---------------

 for a chord between V0 and Vk, the angle of the chord is 15° + 30°*(k-1). Wait, let me see:

Wait when k=1 (step

---------------

 1), the angle was 105°, which is 30°*1 + 75°? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 the angle is 15°*(2k - 1). Wait, for k=1, that would be 15°*1=15°, which doesn't match. Hmm, maybe another

---------------

 approach.

Alternatively, the angle of the chord between V0 and Vk is the average angle between the two vertices plus 90°? Not

---------------

 sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the direction of the chord between Vk and Vm is (angle of Vm + angle of Vk)/2 + 90°, but I need to think carefully

---------------

.

Alternatively, let's note that the direction of the chord is perpendicular to the angle bisector of the central angle between the two vertices. 



---------------

Suppose between two vertices separated by k steps, the central angle is 30°k. The bisector would be at 15°k from each vertex. The direction of the chord would be perpendicular to that bisector. Therefore, the direction of the chord is 15°k ± 90°, but I

---------------

 need to confirm.

Wait, let me think of the chord between V0 (0°) and V1 (30°). The central angle is 30°, so the bisector is at 15°. The chord direction is perpendicular to that, so 15° + 90° = 105°, which matches the earlier calculation. Similarly, for V0 to V2 (60° central angle), the bisector is at 30°, so direction is 30° + 90° = 120°, which matches the second example. 

So

---------------

 in general, the direction angle of the chord between two vertices separated by k steps (k steps clockwise from the first vertex) is 15°k + 90°, but since

---------------

 direction can be measured in either direction, but perhaps modulo 180°, since direction angles repeat every 180°. Wait, actually, the direction of the chord is the

---------------

 angle of the line, so it's modulo 180°, because direction is a line, not a vector. So the

---------------

 direction angle can be taken between 0° and 180°, so adding 90° to the bisector angle gives the direction.

Therefore, for a chord between

---------------

 two vertices separated by k steps (where k is from 1 to 6, since beyond that it's the same as going the other way), the direction angle is 15°k + 90°, but adjusted

---------------

 modulo 180°? Wait, let me see with k=3:

For k=3, central angle is 90°, so the bisector is at 45°, so direction angle is 45° +90° = 135°. Let's verify with coordinates. V0 (1,0) and V3 (cos90°, sin90°) = (0,1). The chord is from (1,0) to (0,1). The direction of this chord is the

---------------

 angle of the vector (-1,1), which is 135°, which matches. 

Another example: k=2,

---------------

 direction was 120°, which is 15*2 + 90 = 30 + 90 = 120, so that works. k=1: 15+90=105, correct. k=4: 15*4=60 +90=150°. Let's check V

---------------

0 to V4. V4 is at 120°, so coordinates (cos120°, sin120°)= (-0.5, sqrt(3)/2). The chord from (1,0) to (-0.5, sqrt(3)/2). The vector is (-1.5, sqrt(3)/2). The angle here is arctan( (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1.5) ). Let's compute:



---------------

sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866, so 0.866 / (-1.5) ≈ -0.577, which is -30°, but since x is negative and y is positive, the angle is 180-30=150°, which matches 15*4 +90 = 150. 

Similarly

---------------

 for k=5: 15*5=75 +90=165°. Let's see V0 to V5 (150°). The coordinates of V5 are (cos150°, sin150°)= (-sqrt(3)/2 ≈-0.866, 0.5). The chord vector is (-sqrt(3)/2 -1, 0.5 -0) ≈ (-1.866, 0.5). The angle would be arctan(0.5 / (-1.866)) ≈ arctan(-0.268), which is in the second quadrant (since x negative, y positive), so 180° - 15° = 165°, which matches 165°. 

k

---------------

=6: 15*6=90 +90= 180°, but 180° direction is equivalent to 0°, but let's check. V0 to V6 is directly

---------------

 opposite, so the chord is along the horizontal axis but negative direction. The vector from V0 (1,0) to V6 (cos180°, sin180°)= (-1,0). The direction is along the negative x-axis, which is 180°, but since

---------------

 direction is modulo 180°, it's equivalent to 0°, but since we are considering the direction of the line, it's 180°, which is the

---------------

 same as 0° in terms of line direction. Hmm, but according to the formula, 15*6 +90 = 180°, which is correct. 

So, in summary, for each k from 1 to 6, the direction of the chord between

---------------

 two vertices separated by k steps is 15k + 90 degrees. However, since direction angles repeat every 180°, directions

---------------

 like 180° are the same as 0°, but since we are considering the direction of the line, they

---------------

 are distinct if they are in different quadrants? Wait no, direction angles are typically measured from 0° to 180°, so 180° is the same as 0° but

---------------

 pointing in the opposite direction, but as a line, it's the same direction. Wait, actually, the direction of a line is the

---------------

 angle it makes with the positive x-axis, measured counterclockwise, but since a line has two directions, the angle is typically

---------------

 taken between 0° and 180°, so 180° is the same as 0°,

---------------

 but in the opposite direction. Hmm, perhaps for our purposes, since we are dealing with vectors, the direction is modulo 180°, so angles differing by 180° are the same direction. 

Therefore, the possible distinct direction angles for chords are 105°, 120°, 135°, 150°, 165°, and 180° (or 0°). However, the

---------------

 chord direction for k=6 is 180°, which is the same as the direction of the chord for k=6 in

---------------

 the opposite direction. Wait, but actually, the chord between V0 and V6 is along the horizontal axis (but negative

---------------

 x direction), so its direction is 180°, which is equivalent to 0° as a line. 

However

---------------

, in terms of forming rectangles, the direction of the sides must be perpendicular. So, two chords are perpendicular if their direction angles differ by 90°. For example, a chord with direction angle θ and another with direction angle θ + 90° would be perpendicular. 

Therefore, for each direction angle θ, we can pair it with θ + 90° to get perpendicular directions. However

---------------

, since direction angles are modulo 180°, θ + 90° might wrap around. 

Let me list all the possible direction angles for chords:



---------------

For k from 1 to 6, the direction angles are:

k=1: 105°

k=2: 120°

k=3: 135°

k=4: 150°

k=5: 165°

k=6: 180° (which is 0°)



---------------

Wait, but 180° is equivalent to 0°, so the direction angles are 105°, 120°, 135°, 150°, 165°, and 0°. 

Now, to

---------------

 find pairs of perpendicular directions, we need two angles that differ by 90°. Let's see:

For each direction θ, check if θ + 90° is also a direction.

---------------

 

Starting with θ = 0° (direction of k=6 chord). Then θ + 90° = 90°, but 90° is not in our list of direction angles. The

---------------

 direction angles we have are 0°, 105°, 120°, 135°, 150°, 165°. 90° isn't there, so 0° can't pair with anything?



---------------

Wait, but maybe I need to check all possibilities. Let me list all direction angles:

0°, 105°, 120°, 135°, 150°, 165°.

Check for each angle �

---------------

�, if θ + 90° is also present (mod 180°).

θ = 0°: 0 + 90 = 90°, not present.

θ = 105°: 105 + 90 = 195°, which mod 180 is 15°, not present.

θ = 120°: 120 +90=210°, mod 180 is 30°, not present.

θ = 135°: 135 +90=225° mod180=45°, not present.

θ =150°:150+90=240 mod180=60°, not present.

θ=165°:165+90=255 mod180=75°, not present.

Hmm, none of these have

---------------

 their perpendicular counterparts in the list. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake here. 

Alternatively, perhaps the direction angles for

---------------

 chords in the other direction (i.e., going the other way around the polygon) can also be considered. For example, the chord between V0 and V_{-1} (which is V11) would be the

---------------

 same as between V0 and V11, which is separated by 11 steps, but since we consider steps up to 6, it

---------------

's equivalent to k=1 step in the other direction. Wait, but the direction angle would be different?

Wait a second, perhaps I need

---------------

 to consider that chords can be in either direction, so for each chord between Vk and Vm, the direction could be in

---------------

 two different directions (from Vk to Vm or vice versa), but the direction angle is still the same. So, perhaps

---------------

 I missed some direction angles?

Wait, let me recalculate direction angles for all chords, considering that k can be from 1 to 6, but the

---------------

 direction angle is 15k +90. Wait, but when k=6, we get 15*6 +90= 90+90=180°, which is 0°, but

---------------

 maybe if we go the other way, like k=6 steps clockwise is the same as 6 steps counterclockwise,

---------------

 but direction angle would be different?

Wait no, the direction angle is determined by the chord's orientation regardless of direction. The

---------------

 chord between V0 and V6 is a straight line through the center, direction 0° or 180°, but since

---------------

 we take modulo 180°, it's 0°. But perhaps there are other chords with different directions?



---------------

Wait, maybe my initial approach was wrong. Let me think again. The direction angle of the chord between V0 and Vk is given

---------------

 by 15k + 90, but actually, when k is greater than 6, but since we consider

---------------

 up to k=6, that's okay. But perhaps chords in the other direction (i.e., going the other way around the polygon) would have different direction angles?

Wait, the

---------------

 chord between Vk and Vm is the same as between Vm and Vk, so their direction angles are the same. So

---------------

, perhaps I need to consider all possible k from 1 to 6, which gives the direction angles as above, but perhaps

---------------

 I need to consider that for each chord, there is a direction angle and its opposite? Wait, but direction angles are modulo 180°, so opposite

---------------

 directions are considered the same direction. 

Hmm, so according to this, none of the chords have perpendicular counterparts? That can't be true

---------------

, because the problem statement says there are rectangles, so there must be some. 

Wait, perhaps I made an error in calculating the direction angles. Let me rec

---------------

alculate for a different chord. For example, the chord between V1 and V4.

Wait let's take another example. Let's consider

---------------

 a chord between V0 and V3 (k=3). The direction angle is 15*3 +90 = 45 + 90 = 135°, as before. Now

---------------

, if I take another chord between V0 and V_{-3} (which would be V9), but that's separated

---------------

 by 9 steps, which is equivalent to 3 steps in the other direction (since 12-9=3). So the direction angle would be the same as for k=3, because

---------------

 it's the same chord but traversed in the opposite direction. So direction is still 135°. 

Alternatively, perhaps chords

---------------

 between non-adjacent vertices can have different direction angles. Wait, maybe I need to think of another way. Let me think

---------------

 of the direction between two vertices not starting at V0. For example, chord between V1 and V4. Let's compute its direction angle.

V1 is at 30°, V4 is at 120°. The central angle between them is 90°, so the bisector is at 75°, so direction angle is 75° +90°=165°? Wait, but

---------------

 according to the previous formula, if the central angle is 90°, then the direction is 15k +90 where k is steps between them. Between

---------------

 V1 and V4, the number of steps is 3 (since 4-1=3). So k=3, so 15*3 +90= 45+90=135°, but according

---------------

 to the bisector method, it would be 165°? Wait, that's a contradiction. 

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 my previous formula was wrong. Let me recast this.

Suppose two vertices are separated by k steps. The central angle between them is 30°k. The bisector angle is the angle halfway between the two vertices. So

---------------

 for V1 (30°) and V4 (120°), the bisector is (30 + 120)/2 = 75°, so the direction of the chord is perpendicular to that, so 75° +90°=165°, which is different from the previous formula. 

Wait, so the

---------------

 formula I used earlier (15k +90) gives for k=3 (steps between V0 and V3) the

---------------

 direction angle 135°, which is correct. But for V1 and V4 (also separated by 3 steps), the direction angle is 165°, which is different. 



---------------

Ah! Here is the mistake. The formula 15k +90° only applies when starting from V0. If starting from another vertex, the direction angle will

---------------

 be different. Therefore, my initial approach was flawed because it only considered chords starting at V0. 

Therefore, the direction of a chord between two vertices separated by k steps can actually be in multiple directions depending on their positions. 



---------------

Therefore, perhaps instead of trying to compute direction angles, I need another approach. 

Alternative Idea: In a regular dodecagon, the

---------------

 perpendicularity condition between two chords can be related to the number of steps between their vertices. 

Suppose we have two chords, each connecting two vertices. Let’s

---------------

 denote the steps between their endpoints as k and m. Then, for the chords to be perpendicular, the angle between them must be 90°. 

The angle between two chords can be determined by the difference in their central angles. Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the angle between the chords is equal to the difference in their direction angles, which are related to their central angles. 

Alternatively, if

---------------

 two chords are perpendicular, then the product of their slopes is -1. Maybe computing slopes for all possible chords is too time-consuming, but perhaps we can find a pattern.

Alternatively, notice

---------------

 that in a regular dodecagon, certain steps between vertices will correspond to chords that are perpendicular. For example, a

---------------

 chord that skips 3 steps (central angle 90°) is perpendicular to another chord that skips 1 step? Let me see.

Wait, let

---------------

 me think of specific examples. Let's take a square inscribed in the dodecagon. A square has four vertices each 90° apart. Since the dodecagon has vertices every 30°, a square would require vertices at 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°, which correspond to steps of 3 each

---------------

 (since 3 steps *30°=90°). So, the square would have vertices V0, V3, V6, V9. The sides of this square are the chords connecting these, each skipping 3 steps. Each

---------------

 side is a chord of 3 steps, so central angle 90°. 

In this case, the sides of the square are perpendicular

---------------

 because the central angle between adjacent vertices of the square is 90°, so the sides are at right angles. Wait

---------------

, actually in a square, the sides themselves are separated by 90°, but the chords here form a square.

---------------

 So this is one rectangle. 

Similarly, another rectangle could be formed by vertices that are offset. For example, starting at V1, V4, V7, V10. That would also form a square. 

So

---------------

 there are several squares in the dodecagon. How many squares are there? Since the dodecagon has 12 vertices, and a square requires

---------------

 every 3rd vertex, the number of squares would be 12 divided by the number of vertices per square divided by 

---------------

4? Wait, each square is determined by its starting vertex, but because of rotational symmetry, each square is counted multiple times. Let me see:

The

---------------

 square can start at any vertex, but rotating by 3 steps (since each step is 30°, 3 steps is 90°, which is the angle of the square's vertex spacing). Since

---------------

 the square has 4 vertices, starting at V0, V3, V6, V9. Starting at V1 would give V1, V4, V7, V10. Similarly, starting at V2 gives V2, V5, V8, V11. Then starting at V3 would be

---------------

 the same as the first one. So there are 3 distinct squares. Wait, 12 vertices divided by 4 vertices per square gives 3?

---------------

 Wait, no. Wait, actually, since each square is counted every 3 steps (the step between vertices in the square is 3). So the number of distinct squares is 12 divided by the step between

---------------

 starting points? Let me see:

The squares are spaced every 3 vertices, so starting at 0, 1, 2, then 

---------------

3 would loop back to the first square. Wait, starting at 0, 3, 6, 9:

---------------

 that's one square. Starting at 1, 4,7,10: second square. Starting at 2,5,8,11: third square. Then starting at 3 would be the same as the first. So there are 3 distinct squares. So that's 3 rectangles (

---------------

squares) so far.

But the problem mentions rectangles, not just squares. So there might be other rectangles that are not squares. 

Another rectangle

---------------

 could be a rectangle that is not a square. For example, suppose we have a rectangle with sides of different lengths. To form a rectangle, the opposite sides must be equal and parallel, and the adjacent sides must be perpendicular. 

Perhaps another

---------------

 rectangle can be formed by selecting vertices that are spaced differently. For example, maybe a rectangle with sides that are chords of different step counts but still

---------------

 perpendicular. 

Let me think of two chords that are perpendicular. Suppose one chord is between vertices separated by k steps, and another by m steps, such that their directions are perpendicular. 

Let

---------------

 me think of an example. Let's try a rectangle formed by vertices V0, V2, V6, V8. 

Let's see:

V0 is (1,0), V2 is (cos60°, sin60°), V6 is (-1,0), V8 is (cos240°, sin240°) = (-0.5, -sqrt(3)/2). 

Connecting

---------------

 V0 to V2: that's a chord of 2 steps (60° central angle). The direction angle for

---------------

 this chord would be, using the previous method, for central angle 60°, the bisector is 30°, so direction is 30° +90°=120°. 

V2 to V6: from

---------------

 V2 (60°) to V6 (180°), that's 6 steps? Wait, the

---------------

 central angle is 120°, so steps would be 4 (since 180-60=120°, which is 4*30°). So direction

---------------

 angle would be 15*4 +90 = 60 +90=150°, but wait

---------------

, starting from V2, the direction angle would be based on the bisector of 120°, which is 60° + 60°=

---------------

 90°? Wait, perhaps better to compute slope.

Coordinates:

V0 to V2: (cos60 -1, sin60 -0) = (-0.5, sqrt(3)/2). The direction angle is arctan( (sqrt(3)/2)/ (-0.5) ) = arctan(-sqrt(3)) which is -60°, but since x is negative and y positive, it's 120°, which matches previous

---------------

.

V2 to V6: from V2 (cos60, sin60) to V6 (-1,0). The vector is (-1 - cos60, -sin60) = (-1.5, -sqrt(3)/2). The direction angle is arctan( (-sqrt(3)/2)/(-1.5) ) = arctan( (sqrt(3)/3) ) = 30°, but since both x and y are negative, it's 180 + 30 = 210°, which is equivalent to -150°, or 210° mod 180 is 30°, but direction

---------------

 angles are taken as 0-180, so 210-180=30°, but direction

---------------

 is 210°, which is 30° below the negative x-axis. Hmm, this might not be perpendicular to the first chord's direction of 120°. 

Wait, 120° and 210°,

---------------

 the difference is 90°? 210-120=90°, so yes. Wait, the angle between them is 90°, so those two chords would be perpendicular. 

Therefore, the sides V0V2 and V2V6 are perpendicular? Let me check the vectors:

Vector V0V2 is from V0 to V2: (cos60 - 1, sin60 - 0) = (-0.5, sqrt(3)/2)



---------------

Vector V2V6 is from V2 to V6: (-1 - cos60, -sin60) = (-1.5, -sqrt(3)/2)

Dot product of these vectors: (-0.5)(-1.5) + (sqrt(3)/2)(-sqrt(3)/2) = 0.75 - (3/4) = 0.75 - 0.75 = 0. 

Ah! The dot product is zero, so they are perpendicular. So this

---------------

 is a valid rectangle. The rectangle is V0, V2, V6, V8 (wait, actually, we

---------------

 need to check all four points). Wait, let's see:

Wait, the four points should form a rectangle. Let's list

---------------

 all four points:

If we have V0 connected to V2, then to V6, then to V8, then back to V0? Let me check coordinates:

V0: (1,0)

V2: (0.5, sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866)

V6: (-1,0)

V8: (cos240°, sin240°) = (-0.5, -sqrt(3)/2 ≈-0.866)

Connecting these points in order, V

---------------

0 to V2 to V6 to V8 to V0?

Wait, let's check the sides:

V0 to V2: that

---------------

's one side.

V2 to V6: second side, which we saw is perpendicular to first.

V6 to V8: third

---------------

 side, direction from (-1,0) to (-0.5, -0.866). The vector is (0.5, -0.866). 

V8 to V0: from (-0.5, -0.866) to (1,0). The vector is (1.5, 0.866).

Now

---------------

, check if the sides V6V8 and V8V0 are perpendicular to their adjacent sides.

Wait, the side V6V8 is

---------------

 from V6 (-1,0) to V8 (-0.5, -sqrt(3)/2). The vector is (0.5, -sqrt(3)/2). The previous side V2V6 had a vector of (-1.5, -sqrt(3)/2). Let me compute the angle between them:

The vector

---------------

 V6V8 is (0.5, -sqrt(3)/2), and the vector V2V6 is (-1.5, -sqrt(3)/2). The dot product is (0.5)(-1.5) + (-sqrt(3)/2)(-sqrt(3)/2) = -0.75 + (3/4) = 0. So they are perpendicular. 

Similarly, the next side V8V0 has vector (1.5, sqrt(3)/2). The previous vector V6V8 is (0.5, -sqrt(3)/2). Their dot product is (1.5)(0.5) + (sqrt(3)/2)(-sqrt(3)/2) = 0.75 - 3/4 = 0. So all

---------------

 adjacent sides are perpendicular. 

Therefore, this is indeed a rectangle. So this is another rectangle beyond the squares. 

So this

---------------

 rectangle has sides of length corresponding to 2 steps and 4 steps? Let me see:

The chord from V0 to V2 is 2 steps (6

---------------

0° central angle), and from V2 to V6 is 4 steps (120° central angle). 



---------------

So in this case, the two perpendicular chords are 2 steps and 4 steps. Their central angles are 60° and 120°, so

---------------

 the angle between their direction angles is 90°, which allowed them to form a rectangle. 

Therefore, perhaps to find all rectangles, we need to find all pairs of step counts (k, m) such that the chords with step k and step m are perpendicular, and then count the number of such rectangles for each pair.

To

---------------

 formalize this, let's denote that for a chord between two vertices separated by k steps (k from 1 to 6), its direction angle is θ_k = 15k + 90°, as computed

---------------

 earlier when starting from V0, but this might vary depending on the starting point. Wait, but actually, the direction angle depends

---------------

 on the central angle between the two vertices, so perhaps the direction angle for a chord of k steps is always θ_k = 15k + 90°, but this

---------------

 might not hold for all positions. Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the direction between two vertices separated by k steps is determined

---------------

 by their central angle, and the direction angle is 90° plus half the central angle. 

Wait, let's think

---------------

 again: For two vertices separated by a central angle of α degrees, the angle of the chord's direction is perpendicular to the bisector of the angle between them. The bisector is at α/2 from each vertex, so the direction angle is (

---------------

starting angle of first vertex + α/2) + 90°, but this might depend on the starting point. 

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 the angle between two chords is 90° if the sum of their central angles is 180°? Wait, maybe

---------------

 not. Let me think of the example above with k=2 and k=4 steps. The central angles were 60° and 120°, which add to 180°, and their chords were perpendicular. 

Wait

---------------

, in that case, 60° +120°=180°, so their bisectors would be 30° and 60°, but

---------------

 the direction angles were 120° and 150°, which differ by 30°, but the actual angle between the chords was 90°, so that relationship

---------------

 isn't directly adding to 180°. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is that the difference between their central angles is

---------------

 90°? Let's see: 120°-60°=60°, not 90°. Hmm. 

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the angle between the chords (the actual angle between their direction vectors) is 90°, so their direction angles differ by 90°. For the example with k

---------------

=2 (direction 120°) and k=4 (direction 150°), the difference is 30°, but they

---------------

 were perpendicular. Wait, this contradicts. Wait, in the example above, the direction angles were 120° and 210°, which differ by 90°?

---------------

 Wait no, 210-120 is 90°, but 210 mod 180 is 30°, so the

---------------

 angle between them is 90°. 

Ah, perhaps the actual angle between two direction angles is the minimal angle between them, which could be the difference or 180° minus the difference. So if

---------------

 two direction angles differ by 90°, then they are perpendicular. 

In the example, direction angles were 120° and 210°, which is a difference of 90°, so they are perpendicular. So in

---------------

 that case, the chords of 2 steps and 4 steps (direction angles 120° and 150°?

---------------

 Wait no, the 4-step chord between V2 and V6 had a direction angle of 150°, but in the example,

---------------

 the direction was 210°, which is equivalent to -150°, but the difference between 120° and 210° is indeed 90°, so they are perpendicular. 

Therefore, the

---------------

 key is that the direction angles of the two chords must differ by exactly 90°, considering modulo 180°.

Therefore, to find perpendicular chords, we need pairs of steps k and m such that their direction angles differ by 90°. 

Given

---------------

 that the direction angle for a chord of k steps is θ_k = 15k + 90°, but this is

---------------

 only when starting from a particular vertex. Wait, no, actually, the direction angle is determined by the central angle between the two vertices. For

---------------

 any chord that skips k steps, the central angle is 30k°, so the bisector is 15k°, so direction angle is 15k° + 90°, but

---------------

 this is relative to the starting point. 

Wait, perhaps the direction angle is independent of the starting vertex? For example, a chord of k steps between any two vertices will have a direction angle of 15k + 90°, but rotated by

---------------

 the starting vertex's angle. 

Hmm, this is getting too confusing. Maybe an alternative approach is better.

Let me think of the regular

---------------

 dodecagon and note that it has rotational symmetry every 30 degrees. Therefore, the number of rectangles can be calculated by considering all possible rectangles centered at the center, and then accounting for their

---------------

 rotations. 

Alternatively, perhaps each rectangle is determined by two pairs of parallel chords, each pair separated by a certain number of steps, and perpendicular to each other. 

Let

---------------

 me consider that for two chords to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes must be -1. Since the dodecagon is regular, the

---------------

 slopes can be determined based on the steps between vertices. 

Alternatively, let me consider all possible pairs of steps (k, m) such that the chords with steps k and m are perpendicular. Then

---------------

 for each such pair, count the number of rectangles that can be formed with sides of those steps. 

First, to find all pairs (k, m) where k

---------------

 and m are between 1 and 6, and the chords of step k and step m are perpendicular. 

To find such pairs, we need to determine

---------------

 for each k, what m satisfies that the direction of a chord of step k is perpendicular to the direction of a chord of step m. 

Let

---------------

 me consider the direction angle for a chord of step k as θ_k = 15k + 90°, as previously

---------------

 computed when starting from V0. But actually, this angle is relative to the starting vertex. Wait, perhaps this is only true

---------------

 when the chord starts at V0, but if the chord is between any two vertices separated by k steps, the direction angle is

---------------

 the same modulo 30°, but rotated by the starting vertex's angle. 

Alternatively, perhaps the direction angles for

---------------

 chords of step k are all of the form 15k + 90° plus multiples of 30°, depending on the starting vertex. 

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 it's better to consider that two chords of steps k and m are perpendicular if the angle between them is 90°, which can

---------------

 be determined by their central angles. 

Wait, the angle between two chords can be found by the difference between their direction angles. Let

---------------

 me consider that if two chords have central angles α and β, then the angle between them is |α/2 - β/2| or something? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 for two chords to be perpendicular, their step counts must satisfy a certain relationship. 

Let me consider that in the example above, the

---------------

 rectangle with sides of steps 2 and 4 (central angles 60° and 120°) are perpendicular. Their

---------------

 central angles add up to 180°, so 60+120=180. 



---------------

Another example: the square has sides of step 3 (central angle 90°), so each side is perpendicular to the next, since

---------------

 90° central angle, so the direction angle would be 15*3 +90=135°, and the next side would be another

---------------

 135° direction but rotated by 90°, so perhaps the step count needs to be different. Wait, in

---------------

 the square, each side is step 3, so their central angles are 90°, so direction angles would be 15*3 +90=135°, but how

---------------

 are they perpendicular?

Wait in the square, the sides are actually separated by 90°, so the direction angles must

---------------

 be 90° apart. Let me see:

In the square V0, V3, V6, V9:

The chord

---------------

 from V0 to V3 is step 3, direction angle 15*3 +90= 45+90=135°.

The next side from V3 to V6 is also step 3, but rotated

---------------

 90°, so its direction angle would be 135° +90°=225°, which mod 180 is 45°, but since

---------------

 direction is modulo 180, 225-180=45°, so the direction is 45°, which is perpendicular to 135°?

---------------

 Wait, 135° and 45° differ by 90°, so yes. 

Ah, so when

---------------

 moving around the square, each subsequent side is rotated by 90°, so their direction angles increase by 90°, which

---------------

 makes them perpendicular. Therefore, in this case, the central angle between vertices is the same (90°), but their direction angles are separated

---------------

 by 90° because the square is rotated. 

Therefore, perhaps the key is that for two chords to be perpendicular, their direction angles must differ by 90°, but since

---------------

 direction angles depend on their position, this can be achieved by selecting chords that are offset appropriately. 

This is getting too vague. Let me try to formal

---------------

ize this:

Suppose we have two chords, one with step k and another with step m. For these chords to form adjacent sides of a rectangle, they must be perpendicular. To ensure this, the angle between their direction vectors must be 90°, regardless of their position on the dodecagon. 

Therefore

---------------

, the direction angles of the two chords must differ by 90°, considering the rotational symmetry. 

Therefore, the step

---------------

 counts k and m must satisfy that the direction angle of a k-step chord differs by 90° from the direction angle of an m-step chord. 

Let

---------------

 me suppose that the direction angle for a k-step chord is θ_k = 15k + 90° (as computed when starting from V0). To

---------------

 find m such that θ_k and θ_m differ by 90°, we can write:

θ_m = θ_k ± 90° mod 180°

So,



---------------

15m +90 ≡ 15k ±90 mod 180

Let's solve for m:

15m ≡15k ±90 -90 mod 180

Wait, let

---------------

 me do this step carefully:

Case 1: θ_m = θ_k +90 mod 180:

15m +90 ≡ 15k +90 +90 mod 180

So

---------------

 15m ≡15k +90 mod 180

Divide both sides by 15:

m ≡k +6 mod 12 (since 180/15=12)

Wait, but

---------------

 m has to be between 1 and 6, so m = k +6 mod 12. 

Wait, but

---------------

 if m =k+6, but since m must be ≤6, then for k from 1 to 6:

If k=1, m=7 →

---------------

 7 mod12=7, which is beyond 6, so invalid.

Similarly, k=2→m=8,

---------------

 etc. So this case may not give valid m.

Wait perhaps mod 12 is not the right modulus here. Let's see:

The equation is 15m ≡15k +90 mod 180

Divide both sides by 15:

m ≡k +6 mod 12.

But

---------------

 since m must be between 1 and 6, the solutions would be m =k +6 -12 when k+6 >12.

---------------

 Wait, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, let's think of 15m ≡15k +90 mod 180



---------------

Divide all terms by 15:

m ≡k +6 mod 12

But m must be between 1 and 6. So m

---------------

 =k +6 or m =k -6. 

But if m =k +6, then since k can be up to 6, m would be up to 12, but m

---------------

 must be ≤6, so subtract 12:

m =k +6 -12 =k -6. 

Therefore

---------------

, m ≡k mod 6. 

Wait, perhaps I need to consider modulo 12, but this is getting too tangled. Let's try specific values.

Suppose k=2 (direction angle 120°). Let's see what m would satisfy θ_m =120° ±90° mod 180°:

120° +90°=210° mod180°=30°, so θ_m=30°.

---------------

 So 15m +90=30 mod180?

Wait, 15m +90 ≡30 mod 180 ⇒

---------------

15m ≡-60 mod180 ⇒15m≡120 mod180 ⇒ divide

---------------

 both sides by 15: m≡8 mod12. But m must be between 1-6, so no solution here.

Alternatively, 120° -90°=30°, so θ_m=30°, same as above, no solution.

Alternatively, maybe I

---------------

'm making a mistake here. Let's take the example where k=2 (direction angle 120°) and m=4 (direction angle 15*4 +90=150°). The difference between 150° and 120° is 30°, which is not 90°, but in the rectangle example earlier, those two chords were perpendicular. Wait, but

---------------

 in that example, the actual direction angle of the second chord was 210°, which is 150° +180°, so the

---------------

 difference between 120° and 210° is 90°, which is why they were perpendicular. 

Ah, so perhaps

---------------

 the direction angle can also be taken as the angle plus 180°, so the difference could be 90° in

---------------

 either direction. 

Therefore, maybe the correct equation is that θ_m = θ_k ±90° mod 180°, allowing for adding

---------------

 180°.

Therefore, for the example with k=2 and m=4:

θ_k=120°, θ_m=150°, but if

---------------

 we take θ_m as 150°-180°= -30°, then the difference would be 120° - (-30°)=150°, which is not 90°, but if we take θ_m as 150°, then difference

---------------

 is 30°, but in the actual case, the direction was 210°, which is 150° +180°, so 

---------------

210°-120°=90°, so yes, that works. 

Therefore, the direction angle can be considered modulo 180°, so adding

---------------

 or subtracting 180° doesn't change the direction. Hence, to find m such that θ_m ≡θ_k ±90° mod 180°, we can have:

Either 15m +90 ≡15k +90 ±90 mod 180

So:



---------------

Case1: 15m +90 =15k +90 +90 mod 180 ⇒15m =15k +90 mod180 ⇒ m =k +6 mod12

Case2:15m +90 =15k +90 -90 mod180 ⇒15m =15k -90 mod180 ⇒m =k -6 mod12

So

---------------

 m must equal k+6 or k-6 modulo12. Since m is between1-6:

For Case1: m=k+6, but if k+6 >6, then m=k+6-12=

---------------

 k-6. 

Similarly, for Case2: m=k-6, but if k-6 <1, then m=k-6+12=k+6.

Therefore

---------------

, the valid solutions are m =k+6 or m=k-6, but adjusted to stay within 1-6.

Thus

---------------

:

If k ≤6:

If m =k+6:

- If k+6 ≤6 ⇒ k ≤0, which isn't possible since k ≥1. So m=k+6 would be >

---------------

6 ⇒ invalid unless we subtract 12.

Wait, perhaps instead of mod12, since the steps are up to 6, the

---------------

 relationship is that m must be k+6 or k-6, but since steps are modulo 12 (since the

---------------

 polygon has 12 vertices), but steps are counted as 1-6. 

Wait, this is confusing. Let me consider

---------------

 specific values of k and see what m would satisfy the condition.

Take k=2:

We want m such that 15m +90 ≡15*2 +90 ±90 mod180.

1

---------------

5*2 +90 =30+90=120. So:

Case1: 15m +90 ≡120 +90=210 mod180 ⇒210 mod180=30 ⇒15m +90 ≡30 mod180 ⇒15m ≡-60 mod180 ⇒15m≡120 mod180 ⇒m≡8 mod12 ⇒m

---------------

=8-12= -4 mod12 ⇒ Not valid.

Case2: 15m +90 ≡120 -90=30 mod180 ⇒ same as above,

---------------

 15m≡-60 ⇒ same result. 

Hmm, but in our example with k=2 and m=4, we

---------------

 had perpendicular chords. What's m=4?

15*4 +90 =60+90=150. 



---------------

So 150 mod180. The difference between 120 and 150 is 30°, but if

---------------

 we take 150-180= -30°, then difference is 150-120=30°, but if

---------------

 we consider 150 as is, it's not 90° apart from 120. But in the example, the actual direction was 210°, which is 150+180, so 210-120=90°, so that

---------------

's valid. 

Therefore, the equation should allow for adding 180° to one of the angles. Hence, perhaps

---------------

 the condition is that either θ_m = θ_k ±90° mod 180° or θ_m +180°= θ_k ±90° mod180°, which is

---------------

 the same as θ_m= θ_k ±90° mod 180°, since angles are modulo 180°. 

Therefore, perhaps

---------------

 my earlier approach is correct but I need to consider that m can be k+6 or k-6 modulo 12, but since

---------------

 steps are counted up to 6, m=k+6 mod6 (since steps beyond 6 are equivalent to steps in the other direction). 

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 m= (k+6) mod6? Let me see:

If k=2, then m=(2+6)=8 mod6=2. Hmm

---------------

, no. Not helpful.

Alternatively, since steps beyond 6 are equivalent to 12 -k, but direction is same as k

---------------

 steps in the other direction. 

Alternatively, maybe the relationship is that for a chord of k steps, the perpendicular chord must be of step

---------------

 (6 -k). Let me test this:

Take k=2, then m=6-2=4, which matches our example (steps 2 and 4).

Another example, k=1: m=5. Let's see if steps 1 and 5 are perpendicular.

Ch

---------------

ords of 1 step (30° central angle) and 5 steps (150° central angle). 

The direction angles would be for k=1: 15*1+90=105°, for m=5:15*5+90=165°. The difference between 165 and 105 is 60°, which isn't 90°, but if we take 165°-180°= -15°, then difference is 105 - (-15)=120°, not 90. Hmm, not working

---------------

. 

Wait, but perhaps their actual direction angles when placed appropriately can be 90° apart?

Let me take specific vertices. Let's try a

---------------

 rectangle with steps 1 and 5.

Suppose we have vertices V0, V1, V6, V5. 

Wait, let's see:

V0 to V1 is a step of 1 (30° central angle). The direction angle is 105° as before. 

V1 to V6 is step 5 (since from V1 to V6 is 5 steps clockwise).

---------------

 The central angle is 150°, so direction angle is 15*5 +90=75+90=165°. The difference between 105° and 165° is 60°, which is not 90°, so they

---------------

 wouldn't be perpendicular. 

Hmm, so maybe this pair isn't perpendicular. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to choose different vertices. Let's see:

Suppose we have V0 connected to V1 (step1), and then V

---------------

1 connected to V6 (step5), but then the next vertex would have to be V6 connected to V11 (step5),

---------------

 but that might not form a rectangle. 

Alternatively, maybe this approach is flawed. 

Wait another example: Let's try

---------------

 steps k=3 and m=3 (the square). 

For k=3: direction angle 15*3 +90=135°. 



---------------

m=3 would give the same angle. To get perpendicular, need another m such that 135 ±90 mod180.



---------------

135+90=225 mod180=45°, so m must satisfy 15m +90=45 mod180 ⇒15m= -45 mod180 ⇒15m=135 mod180 ⇒m=9 mod12 ⇒ which

---------------

 is 9, which is over 6. So no solution. Wait, but in the square, the next side is also step3 but rotated, so perhaps

---------------

 it's allowed because the direction is different due to rotation.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think numerically for

---------------

 each possible pair of steps (k,m) from 1-6 and see if their chords can be perpendicular.

Let me list all possible pairs (k, m) where 1 ≤k, m ≤6, and check if there exists a rectangle with sides of steps k and m.

First

---------------

, list all possible pairs:

Total pairs: 6*6=36, but since (k,m) and (m,k) would be similar, but since

---------------

 rectangles can have different orientations, maybe all need to be considered.

Let me make a table of direction angles for k=1 to 6:

k | direction angle (θ_k) =15k +90°

---------------

 mod 180°
---|---
1 | 15+90=105°
2 | 30+90=120°
3 |45+90=135°
4 |60+90=150°
5 |75+90=165°
6 |90+90=180° (

---------------

which is 0°)

Now, for each k from 1-6, find m such that θ_m ≡θ_k ±90° mod180°.

For k=1 (θ=105°):

Need

---------------

 θ_m =105+90=195° mod180=15°, or θ_m=105-90=15°.



---------------

So θ_m must be 15° or 195° mod180 (which is same as 15°). 

Looking at the direction angles, none of the θ_m equals

---------------

 15°, so no m for k=1.

Wait, but 15° is not in the list. So no.



---------------

k=2 (θ=120°):

θ_m =120±90 → 210° mod180=30° or 30°, or 30° and

---------------

 210°.

Looking for θ_m=30°, which is not in the list. So no m for k=2.

Wait, but in the earlier example with k=2 and m=4 (θ_m=150°), the

---------------

 actual direction was 210°, which is 150+180. So θ_m=210°≡

---------------

30° mod180. But 30° isn't a listed direction angle. Hmm, so perhaps this approach is missing something.

Wait, the

---------------

 direction angle for m=4 is 150°, but if we take the other direction, it could be -30°, which is 150°-180°, but mod

---------------

 180 it's -30°≡150°. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the direction angle can

---------------

 also be taken as the supplementary angle?

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the direction angle could also be measured in the opposite direction, so for

---------------

 a chord of k steps, the direction angle could also be θ_k +180°, which would be equivalent to the direction angle of a chord of (12 -k) steps.

Wait, for

---------------

 example, a chord of 1 step has direction 105°, but the opposite direction would be 105°+180=285°, which is equivalent to -75°, but modulo

---------------

 180 is 105°-180= -75° mod180 is 105°-

---------------

180= -75° + 180=105°? No. 

Alternatively, perhaps the direction angle of

---------------

 a chord going the other way is θ_k +180°, which would correspond to another direction. 

Wait

---------------

, perhaps the direction angle of a chord between V_i and V_j is either θ or θ+180°, depending on the direction. Since

---------------

 a line has two directions, the direction angle can be considered as θ or θ+180°, which are the same line. 

Therefore, when looking for perpendicular directions, we can allow θ_m = θ_k ±90° mod180°, where

---------------

 θ_m can be either the direction of the chord or its opposite. 

Therefore, for k=2 (θ=120°), we need θ_m =

---------------

120±90 mod180 → 210° or 30°, but also considering

---------------

 adding 180°, so 120+90+180=390≡30°, same

---------------

 as before. 

But none of the direction angles are 30°, so no m for k=2. But in

---------------

 the example with k=2 and m=4, we had a rectangle. 

Wait, let's re-examine that example. The two

---------------

 chords were step 2 and step4.

θ_k=120°, θ_m=150°. The difference is 30°, not 90°, but in the actual example

---------------

, the second chord's direction was 210°, which is 150°+180°, so 210°-120°=90°. Ah! So,

---------------

 if we take θ_m as 210°, then it satisfies the condition. 

Therefore, the direction angle can also be taken as θ_m +180°, so we

---------------

 can consider that θ_m =150°, but when considering the direction, it can be 150° or 150°+180°=330°. 



---------------

Wait, but 330° is equivalent to -30°, so the difference between 120° and 330° is 210°, which is more than 180°, so the minimal angle between them is 150°, not 90°. Hmm, this

---------------

 is confusing. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle between two lines with direction angles θ and φ is the minimum of |θ - φ| and 180° - |θ - φ|. 

Therefore, the angle between 120° and 210° is 90°, since 210-120=90°, so that's good

---------------

. 

So, in this case, even though the listed direction angle for m=4 is 150°, when

---------------

 we take the direction in the other direction (i.e., the line extending the other way), its direction angle becomes 150°+180°=330°, which would give a difference of 210°, but since we can choose the direction, perhaps we can take

---------------

 the smaller angle difference. 

Wait, perhaps the key is that for any two lines, their angle is the minimum between the difference and 180° minus the difference. So between 120° and 150°, the angle is 30°, but between 120° and 330°, it's 110°, which

---------------

 is still not 90°. 

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think differently. 

Instead

---------------

 of trying to calculate angles, perhaps look for rectangles by their vertices. 

A rectangle is determined by four vertices such that the midpoints of the diagonals coincide and the sides are perpendicular. 

In a regular dodecagon, the diagonals of the rectangle must also be diameters if it's a square, but for other rectangles, maybe not. 

Alternatively, since

---------------

 all rectangles must have their vertices on the dodecagon's vertices, we can look for all sets of four vertices that form a rectangle. 

A

---------------

 rectangle requires that for any two adjacent vertices, the next one is obtained by rotating by 90°, but scaled appropriately. 

Alternatively, the

---------------

 four vertices must form two pairs of parallel chords, each pair separated by the same step count and perpendicular to each other. 

Let

---------------

 me try to find all possible rectangles by considering possible step counts for their sides. 

First, squares:

As before, squares are formed by vertices

---------------

 every 3 steps (since 3*30°=90°), so step count 3. There are 3 distinct squares as discussed

---------------

 earlier. 

Next, rectangles that are not squares. 

Example: The rectangle with vertices V0, V2, V6, V8. 

Steps between V0 and V2 is 2, between V2 and V6 is 4, between V6 and V8 is 2 (since

---------------

 V6 to V8 is 2 steps clockwise), and between V8 and V0 is 4 steps (since V8 to V0 is 4 steps counterclockwise, but step

---------------

 count is minimum steps, so 4 steps clockwise from V8 to V0 is 4 steps. Wait, actually from

---------------

 V8 (240°) to V0 (0°), the shorter path is 4 steps clockwise (since 12-8=4).

---------------

 

So the sides alternate between steps of 2 and 4. This rectangle is formed by steps 2 and 4. 

Similarly, we

---------------

 can rotate this rectangle by 30°, 60°, etc., to get other rectangles of the same type. 

How many such rectangles are there?

The starting vertex can be any of the 12 vertices, but since the rectangle has 4 vertices, each rectangle is counted 4 times (once for each vertex as the starting point). Additionally

---------------

, since the rectangle can be rotated in steps that align with the dodecagon's symmetry, there might be overlapping counts. 

Let me see:

---------------

 The rectangle V0, V2, V6, V8 is one. Starting at V1, we'd have V1, V3, V7, V9. Similarly up to V3,

---------------

 V5, V9, V11. Then starting at V4 would give V4, V6, V10, V0 (which is the same as the first rectangle).

---------------

 So there are 3 distinct rectangles of this type (step 2 and 4), similar to the squares. 

Wait, starting

---------------

 at V0 gives one rectangle. Starting at V1 gives another, V2 another, and V3 would give the fourth? Wait:

Wait let

---------------

's list them:

Starting at V0: V0, V2, V6, V8

Starting at V1: V1, V3, V7, V9

Starting at V2: V2, V4, V8, V10

Starting at V3: V3, V5, V9, V11

Starting at V4: V4, V6, V10, V0 → which is the same as the first one shifted

---------------

.

So there are 3 distinct rectangles of this type? Wait, no, starting at V0, V1, V2, V3 give 4 distinct rectangles, but since

---------------

 the dodecagon has 12 vertices and the rectangle has 4 vertices, each rectangle is counted 4 times (once for each starting vertex). So total number is 12/4=3? Wait, 

---------------

12 vertices divided by 4 vertices per rectangle gives 3, but when starting at V0, V1, V2, V3, etc

---------------

., each set is unique until you reach V4 which loops back. 

Wait, V0, V2, V6, V8 is

---------------

 one rectangle. 

V1, V3, V7, V9 is another. 

V2, V4, V8, V10 is third. 

V3, V5, V9, V11 is fourth. 

V4, V6, V10, V0 is the first one again. 

So

---------------

 actually, there are 3 distinct rectangles? Or 4? Because starting at V0, V1, V2, V3 each give unique rectangles, then V4 repeats

---------------

 the first. 

So since 12 vertices divided by 4 vertices per rectangle gives 3 distinct rectangles if they are spaced every 3 vertices, but here the

---------------

 spacing is different. Let me count:

The first rectangle is at positions 0,2,6,8. 

The next at 1,3,7,9.

Then 2,4,8,10.

Then 3,5,9,11.

Then 4,6,10,0 (which is the first one

---------------

 again). 

So there are 4 distinct rectangles of this type? Since each starting point every 1 vertex gives a new one until it

---------------

 cycles back after 4. Wait, but 12/4=3? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. 

Wait each rectangle has 4 vertices, so the number of distinct rectangles should be 12 divided by the number of vertices per rectangle divided by the rotational symmetry. 



---------------

Alternatively, since each rectangle can be rotated by 30° to get another one, but not all rotations will produce distinct rectangles. 

The

---------------

 first rectangle (0,2,6,8) can be rotated by 30° to get (1,3,7,9), another rotation gives (2,4,8,10), another gives (3,5,9,11), and another rotation by

---------------

 30° would give (4,6,10,0), which is the first rectangle shifted. So there are 4 distinct rectangles of this type. 

Wait

---------------

 12 vertices divided by the 4 vertices per rectangle gives 3, but since the rotation cycle is 4 steps to return, so

---------------

 maybe 3 is not correct. 

Actually, since the step between the starting points is 1 (each next rectangle starts at next vertex), and after 4 steps it repeats, so total of 4 distinct rectangles. 

Thus

---------------

, there are 4 rectangles with steps 2 and 4. 

Wait, but in the example above with starting at V0, V1, V2, V3, V

---------------

4, etc., we get four distinct rectangles before repeating, so yes, 4. 

Similarly, are there other rectangles

---------------

 with different step pairs?

Another example: Let's consider steps 1 and 5. 

Suppose we try to form a rectangle with steps 1 and 5. Let's see if such a rectangle exists.

Take V0 connected to V1 (step1), then from V1, we need to move perpendicular

---------------

 to that step1 chord. 

The direction of step1 is 105°, so perpendicular direction is 105+90=195° or 105-90=15°. 

To get a step that has direction 15° or 195°, which

---------------

 would correspond to m such that 15m +90 =15° mod180 →15m= -75 mod180 → m= ( -75 + 180)/15= 105/15=7 → m

---------------

=7 mod12 → invalid. 

Alternatively, 15m +90=195° mod180 →15m=105 →m=7,

---------------

 again invalid. 

Hmm, so maybe no such rectangles with steps 1 and 5. 

Another possible pair: steps 3 and 3 (the squares). We already counted those as 3 rectangles. 

What

---------------

 about steps 4 and 2? We already considered steps 2 and 4, which gave us 4 rectangles. 

Steps

---------------

 5 and 1: same as above, no. 

Steps 6 and ?: steps of 6 are diameters (straight

---------------

 lines through the center). 

A diameter is a step of 6, central angle 180°. The direction angle would be 15*6+90=180°, which is 0°. 

To

---------------

 form a rectangle with a diameter, we need another diameter perpendicular to it. 

A perpendicular diameter would be at 90°, but in

---------------

 our direction angles, there is no chord with direction 90°, but maybe the diameter at 90° is

---------------

 also a step of 6 but rotated. 

Wait, a diameter at 90° would be between vertices V1 (30°) and V7 (210°), which is step 6 (since 7-1=6). The direction angle for this would be 15*6 +90=180°, but rotated

---------------

. 

Wait, the direction angle for a diameter (step6) between V0 and V6 is 0° or 180°, and

---------------

 between V1 and V7 is 90° direction? 

Wait, let's compute the direction angle for step6 between V1 and V7:

Central angle is 180°, so bisector is 90°, so direction angle is 90°+90°=180°? Wait no, using

---------------

 the formula: 15k +90° where k=6 gives 15*6+90=180°, but for

---------------

 the chord between V1 and V7, the central angle is 180°, so direction angle is 90°+90°=180°, same as before. 

Wait, regardless

---------------

 of which diameter you take, the direction angle would be 0° or 180°, because the bisector is 90° from the vertices, so direction angle is 90+90=180°, but modulo

---------------

 180°, it's 0°. 

Therefore, all diameters have direction angles of 0° or 180°, so they are all aligned along the same direction (horizontal axis in our coordinate system). Therefore, there

---------------

 are no perpendicular diameters, so rectangles cannot be formed with two diameters as sides, since they are parallel. 

However, a rectangle can be formed with one diameter and two other chords perpendicular to it. 

Wait, for example, take the horizontal diameter V0-V6 and another

---------------

 vertical diameter V3-V9. These are perpendicular. So the rectangle would be V0, V3, V6, V9, which is a square, already counted. 

Alternatively

---------------

, if we have a diameter and another chord perpendicular to it. 

Suppose we take the diameter V0-V6 (step6), and then a

---------------

 perpendicular chord of step3 (direction135°). The rectangle would be V0, V3, V6, V9, which is the square again. 

So

---------------

 the only rectangles involving diameters are the squares. 

Another possible pair: steps 1 and 7 (but steps can

---------------

't exceed 6). 

Wait, steps must be between 1 and 6. 

Another pair: steps 2 and 5. 

Let me see. For

---------------

 steps 2 and 5:

θ2=120°, θ5=165°. The difference between them is 45°, not 90°, but perhaps if

---------------

 we take one in the opposite direction. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a rectangle with steps 2 and 5. 

Let me try constructing one. 



---------------

Start at V0. Move 2 steps to V2. From V2, we need to move in a direction perpendicular to the first side. The first side was

---------------

 step2 (direction120°), so the next side should be direction 210° (120+90). 

A direction of 210° corresponds to a

---------------

 step m where 15m +90=210 mod180. 

210 mod180=30°, so 15m+90=30 mod180 ⇒15m= -60 mod180 ⇒15m=120 mod180 ⇒m=8 mod12 ⇒ invalid

---------------

. 

Alternatively, the direction of 210° could be achieved by another step. 

Alternatively, perhaps there is no such rectangle with steps 2 and 5. 

Another

---------------

 pair: steps 4 and 1. 

θ4=150°, θ1=105°. Difference is 45°, so no. 

Steps 5 and 4: �

---------------

�5=165°, θ4=150°. Difference is 15°, no. 

Steps 3 and 6:

θ3=135°, θ6=0°. The difference between 135 and 0 is 135°, which isn't 90°. 

Steps 6 and 3: same as above. 

Steps 5

---------------

 and 2: already checked. 

Steps 4 and 5: difference 15°. 

Steps 1 and 4: θ1=105°, θ4=150°, difference 45°. 

Steps 2 and 3: difference 15°. 

Hmm, seems like the only valid pairs are (3,3) for squares and (2,4) for the other rectangles. 

Wait, what about steps 1 and 7 (invalid)

---------------

 or steps 5 and 1?

Alternatively, let's think of another rectangle with steps 1 and 5:

Suppose we have

---------------

 vertices V0, V1, V6, V5. 

V0 to V1 is step1 (30° central angle). 

V1 to V6 is step5 (150° central angle). 

V

---------------

6 to V5 is step-1 (equivalent to step11, but minimal is step1 in the other direction). 

V5 to V0 is step-5 (equivalent to step7, minimal step5). 

Wait

---------------

, let's compute vectors:

V0 (1,0) to V1 (cos30, sin30). Vector is (cos30-1, sin30).

V1 to V6: from V1 (30°) to V6 (180°). The vector is (cos180 - cos30, sin180 - sin30)= (-1 - cos30, -sin30).

Dot

---------------

 product of first two vectors:

[(cos30 -1)(-1 - cos30) + (sin30)(-sin30)]

= (cos30 -1)(-1 -cos30) - (sin30)^2

Expand:

= - (cos30 -1)(1 + cos30) - (sin30)^2

= - [cos30*(1) + cos^2 30 -1 -cos30] - (sin30)^2

= - [cos^2 30 -1] - (sin30)^2 

Using

---------------

 identity cos²θ + sin²θ =1,

= - [ (cos²30 -1) ] - (1 - cos²30)

= - [ - sin²30 ] - (1 - cos²30)

= sin²30 - (1 - cos²30 )

= (sin²30 + cos²30) -1

= 1 -1 =0.

Oh

---------------

! The dot product is zero, so they are perpendicular. 

So this is a valid rectangle! 

Wait, so the

---------------

 rectangle V0, V1, V6, V5 is indeed a rectangle with steps 1 and 5. 

But

---------------

 according to my previous calculations, I thought there was no such pair, but clearly there is. 

Let me check the direction angles:

The first side (step1) has direction angle 105°, the second side (step5) between V1 and V6 has central angle 150°, so direction angle is 15*5 +90=165°. The difference between 105 and 165 is 60°, but if

---------------

 we take the direction angle of the second side as 165°+180°=345°, then the difference between 105 and 345 is 240°, which mod 180 is 60°, but if

---------------

 we take the minimal angle between 105° and 165°, it's 60°, not 90°, but the vectors are perpendicular. 

Hmm, this

---------------

 contradicts my previous assumption that the direction angles need to differ by 90°, but the vectors are perpendicular. 

Therefore

---------------

, my earlier approach was incorrect. The direction angle difference isn't the right way to calculate perpendicularity. 

So, in

---------------

 this case, the two chords (step1 and step5) are perpendicular even though their direction angles differ by 60°, because the actual vectors are perpendicular. 

This means my previous

---------------

 method of using direction angles was flawed. I need a different approach. 

Let me instead consider that two chords are perpendicular if the dot product of their vectors is zero. 

To formal

---------------

ize, for two chords between vertices Vk and Vm, and between Vm and Vn, the vectors must be perpendicular. 

However

---------------

, this could get very calculation-heavy, but maybe we can find a pattern.

The example with steps1 and 5 worked

---------------

 because the vectors were perpendicular. Let's see why:

The first vector (step1) from V0 to V1 is (cos30 -1, sin30). 

Second vector (step5) from V1 to V6 is (cos180 - cos30, sin180 - sin30) = (-1 - cos30, -sin30).

Their dot product is zero as shown earlier. 

Therefore

---------------

, this pair (steps1 and5) works. 

Similarly, let's see if other pairs work. 

Steps 2 and 5: Let's try.



---------------

Take V0 to V2 (step2), then V2 to V7 (step5). 

Vector1: V2 - V0 = (cos60 -1, sin60 -0).

Vector2: V7 - V2 = (cos210 - cos60, sin210 - sin60).

Compute their dot product:

(cos60 -1)(cos210 - cos60) + (sin60)(sin210 - sin60)

This might

---------------

 be zero?

Let me compute numerically:

cos60=0.5, sin60≈0.866

cos210=cos(180+30)= -cos30≈-0.866, sin210= -sin30≈-0.5

Vector1 components:

(0.5 -1, 0.866) = (-0.5, 0.866)

Vector2 components:

(-0.866 -0.5, -0.5 -0.866) = (-1.366, -1.366)

Dot product: (-0.5)(-1.366) + (0.866)(-1.366)

= 0.683 - 1.183 ≈-0.5 ≠0. Not perpendicular. 

So steps 2 and5 don't work. 

Another

---------------

 pair: steps4 and 2 (already works in the earlier example). 

Steps1 and5 work. Let's see how many rectangles of

---------------

 this type there are.

Starting at V0, we have V0, V1, V6, V5.

Starting

---------------

 at V1: V1, V2, V7, V6?

Wait let's see:

V1 to V2 (step1), then from V2 to V7 (step5). 



---------------

But then the next vertex would be V7 to V6 (step-1), and back to V1? 

Wait,

---------------

 need to close the rectangle. 

Wait, the rectangle starting at V0 is V0, V1, V6, V5. 

Next

---------------

 vertex after V6 should be V5, which is step-1 from V6 (since V5 is previous vertex). 

So

---------------

, the steps are 1,5,1,5. 

Therefore, the rectangle is determined by steps1 and5. 

Similarly

---------------

, starting at V1, we'd have V1, V2, V7, V6. 

Then V6 to V5 (step-1) would

---------------

 not be part of this. 

Wait let me check the vectors:

From V1 to V2 (step1): vector (cos60 - cos30, sin60 - sin30).

From V2 to V7 (step5): vector (cos210 - cos60, sin210 - sin60).

Their

---------------

 dot product must be zero. 

Compute:

cos60=0.5, sin60≈0.866

cos30≈0.866, sin30=0.5

Vector1: (0.5 -0.866, 0.866-0.5) = (-0.366, 0.366)

Vector2: (-0.866 -0.5, -0.5 -0.866) = (-1.366, -1.366)

Dot product: (-0.366)(-1.366) + (0.366)(-1.366) = (0.366*1.366)(1 -1)=0. 

Wait, wait

---------------

:

Wait first term: (-0.366)(-1.366) = 0.366*1.366

Second term: (0.366)(-1.366)= -0.366*1.366

Total is 0.366*1.366 -0.366*1.366 =0. 

Ah! So the

---------------

 dot product is zero. Therefore, this is also a valid rectangle. 

So the rectangle V1, V2, V7, V6 is valid. 

Continuing this, starting at V2: V2, V3, V8, V7. 

This should also form a rectangle. 

Similarly, each

---------------

 starting vertex can form such a rectangle, but since the rectangle has four vertices, each rectangle is counted four times (once for each vertex as the starting point). 

The

---------------

 total number of such rectangles would be 12 vertices divided by 4 vertices per rectangle = 3 distinct rectangles? 

Wait let's see:

Starting at V0: V0, V1, V6, V5

Starting at V1: V1, V2, V7, V6

Starting at V2: V2, V3, V8, V7

Starting at V3: V3, V4, V9, V8

Starting at V4: V4, V5, V10, V9

Starting at V5: V5, V6, V11, V10

Starting at V6: V6, V7, V0, V5 → same as first rectangle.



---------------

So every 6 steps, it repeats. Wait, after V6, starting at V6 gives back to the first rectangle. 

Wait,

---------------

 actually, starting at V0:

V0, V1, V6, V5

Next, V1 gives V1, V2, V7, V6

V2 gives V2, V3, V8, V7

V3 gives V3, V4, V9, V8

V4 gives V4, V5, V10, V9

V5 gives V5, V6, V11, V10

V6 gives V6, V7, V0, V5 (which is the first rectangle shifted

---------------

)

So there are 6 distinct rectangles of this type? Because starting every vertex from V0 to V5 gives a unique rectangle, and then V6 starts

---------------

 repeating. 

Wait, but each rectangle has four vertices, so the total number is 12 vertices /4 =3, but here we have 6 distinct

---------------

 ones. 

Wait, perhaps the direction of the rectangle matters? Or maybe they are actually the same when rotated. 

Wait,

---------------

 the rectangle starting at V0 and the one starting at V3 are rotated by 90°, but in the dodecagon, rotating

---------------

 by 30° each time, so they are distinct. 

Actually, each rectangle is separated by 30° rotations, so there are 12/ (number of vertices between repeats

---------------

). Since starting every vertex gives a new rectangle until after 6 steps it starts to repeat with V6 giving the first one shifted

---------------

. 

Wait, after 6 steps, you end up at V6, which starts a rectangle that's the same as the first one but rotated by 6*30=180°, so it's the same rectangle mirrored. 

Wait, actually

---------------

, the rectangle V0, V1, V6, V5 is the same as V6, V5, V0, V1 just

---------------

 traversed in the opposite direction. So they are the same rectangle. 

Therefore, each rectangle is counted twice in this way

---------------

 (once clockwise and once counter-clockwise), so the total number is 6/2=3 distinct rectangles of this type. 

Wait, but V

---------------

0's rectangle and V3's rectangle are different because they are rotated by 90°, so they are distinct. 

Wait, let's visualize

---------------

:

The rectangle V0, V1, V6, V5 has vertices at 0°, 30°, 180°, 150°. 

The rectangle starting at V3 is V3 (90°), V4 (120°), V9 (270°), V8 (240°). These are rotated by 90° from the first one. 

Similarly, starting at V6 gives V6, V7 (210°), V0, V5 (150°), which is the same as the first rectangle but flipped

---------------

. 

Therefore, every 3 starting points give a new distinct rectangle. Since 12 vertices divided by 4 vertices per rectangle gives 3, but since

---------------

 each rectangle can be started at four different vertices, the distinct count is 3. 

Wait, but when starting at V0, V1, V2, V3,

---------------

 etc., each step gives a new rectangle until after 3 steps it's rotated by 90°, and after 6 steps it's the same rectangle flipped. 

Therefore

---------------

, there are 3 distinct rectangles of this type (step1 and5). 

So total rectangles so far:

- Squares (step3 and3): 3 rectangles.

- Rectangles with steps2 and4: 4 rectangles (ear

---------------

lier count thought 4, but maybe it's 3?)

Wait, let's re-examine the steps2 and4 rectangles:

Starting at V0: V0, V2, V6, V8

Starting at V1: V1, V3, V7, V9

Starting at V2: V2, V4, V8, V10

Starting at V3: V3, V5, V9, V11

Starting at V4: V4, V6, V10, V0 → same as first.



---------------

Starting at V5: V5, V7, V11, V1 → same as second.

So each rectangle is counted every 3 starting points.

---------------

 

The distinct rectangles are:

1. V0, V2, V6, V8

2. V1, V3, V7, V9

3. V2, V4, V8, V10

4. V3, V5, V9, V11

But

---------------

 after that, starting at V4 repeats the first one. So there are 4 distinct rectangles of this type. 

Therefore

---------------

, the count is 4.

Similarly for the steps1 and5 rectangles, we have 3 distinct rectangles? Or 6?

Wait,

---------------

 let's see:

Starting at V0: rectangle 1.

Starting at V1: rectangle 2.

Starting at V2: rectangle3.

Starting at V3: rectangle4.

Starting at V4: rectangle5.

Starting at V5: rectangle6.

But then

---------------

 V6 starts repeating. 

However, each set of 4 vertices forms a unique rectangle until after 6 steps. Since

---------------

 the step1 and5 rectangles are rotated by 30° each time, they form 6 distinct rectangles before repeating? But since

---------------

 the dodecagon has rotational symmetry every 30°, they are all distinct. 

Wait, but when you rotate by 60°, you get a different rectangle. 

For example, the first rectangle (

---------------

V0, V1, V6, V5) is at positions 0°, 30°, 180°, 150°.

Rotating by 30° gives V1, V2, V7, V6 (

---------------

30°,60°,210°,180°).

Another rotation gives V2, V3, V8, V7 (60°,90°,240°,210°).

Continuing, these

---------------

 are all distinct until after 6 rotations (180°), which would flip the rectangle but still keep it distinct. 

Therefore, there are 6 distinct rectangles with steps1 and5. 

Wait, but each

---------------

 rectangle has 4 vertices, so the total number would be 12 /4=3, but since they are spaced

---------------

 every 1 vertex, it's 12/ (steps between repeats). 

Wait, the first rectangle is at V0, then

---------------

 next at V1, etc., and after 6 steps you get to V6 which is the first rectangle rotated 180°, which is a different rectangle.

---------------

 

Therefore, there are 6 distinct rectangles of this type. 

So total rectangles so far:

- Squares: 3

- Steps2 and4:4

- Steps1 and5:6

Are

---------------

 there any other pairs?

Let me check steps3 and6. 

Steps3 and6:

A step3 chord (direction135°) and step6 (direction0°). 

Take

---------------

 V0, V3, V6, V9 (a square, already counted).

Another possibility: 

V0 to V3 (step3), then from V3, move

---------------

 step6 to V9, then step3 to V12 (which is V0). But that's the square again. 

No

---------------

 new rectangles here.

Steps4 and5:

θ4=150°, θ5=165°, difference 15°, not

---------------

 perpendicular. 

Steps1 and2:

θ1=105°, θ2=120°, difference 15°, no. 

Steps5 and4: same as steps2 and4 but

---------------

 reversed. 

Steps4 and1: same as steps1 and4, not perpendicular. 

Steps3 and2:

θ3=135°, θ2=120°, difference15°, no. 

Steps3 and1:

θ3=135°, θ1=105°, difference30°, no. 

Steps5 and2: tried

---------------

 earlier, no.

Steps5 and4: already considered. 

Steps5 and5: would be a square but with step5, which is 150° central angle. But

---------------

 step5*2=10 steps, which is more than 6. 

Wait, step5 is 150°, so a

---------------

 square would need steps of 45°, which would be step1.5, but steps must be integer. 

So no squares with step5. 

Steps

---------------

6 and6: diameters, but they are parallel, can't form rectangles except squares already counted. 

Steps2 and5: tried

---------------

 earlier, but didn't work. 

Steps4 and1: tried. 

Steps1 and3:

θ1=105°, θ3=135°, difference30°, no. 

Steps2 and3: difference15°, no. 

Steps5

---------------

 and3: difference30°, no. 

Steps4 and6: direction angles 150° and0°, difference150°, no. 

Steps6 and any

---------------

 other: only squares. 

Thus, the only possible rectangles are:

- Squares: 3

- Steps2 and4:4

- Steps1 and5:6

Total:3+4+6=13? 

Wait, but let

---------------

 me confirm counts again.

Squares:3 (each square is counted once, as they have 4 vertices and the count

---------------

 is 12/4 / rotational symmetry. Since squares are every 3 steps, starting at V0, V1, V2, but wait

---------------

 actually earlier we saw there are 3 squares:

V0, V3, V6, V9

V1, V4, V7, V10

V2, V5, V8, V11

So

---------------

 three squares.

Steps2 and4 rectangles:4 distinct ones as previously determined.

Steps1 and5 rectangles:6 distinct ones (

---------------

each starting vertex gives a new rectangle until after 6, which is a distinct one rotated 180°).

Therefore

---------------

 total rectangles:3+4+6=13.

Wait but the problem statement shows three examples, which might include squares

---------------

 and other types. 

However, I need to ensure there are no other rectangle types. 

Wait, let's consider another pair: steps3

---------------

 and something else?

Steps3 and 3 (squares already counted).

Steps3 and 6 (diameters,

---------------

 squares).

Another idea: maybe steps 4 and 2 are the same as steps 2 and4, so counted already

---------------

.

Steps5 and1 are same as steps1 and5.

Thus, total is 3+4+6=13.

But wait let me think

---------------

 again about steps2 and4 rectangles count. 

Earlier analysis suggested 4 distinct rectangles for steps2 and4. 

Steps

---------------

1 and5:6 rectangles.

Squares:3.

Total 13. 

However, I might have made a mistake in counts. Let me recount

---------------

:

Squares:3 rectangles.

Steps2 and4: starting at V0, V1, V2, V3 give

---------------

 4 distinct rectangles before repeating. So 4.

Steps1 and5: starting at each vertex gives a unique rectangle until after 6, so 6.

Total 3+4+6=13.

But let

---------------

's see if there are any more pairs. 

Wait, what about steps4 and 2 with different orientations? No, already counted.

Another

---------------

 possible rectangle: steps 5 and 2 with different steps?

Wait, steps5 and 2: we saw that they

---------------

 aren't perpendicular except in specific cases. 

Wait another example: steps4 and1:

Take V0, V4 (step4), then from V4, step

---------------

1 to V5. 

Vectors:

V0 to V4: direction150°, V4 to V5: direction1

---------------

05°. 

Dot product?

Vector from V0 to V4: (cos120 -1, sin120).

V4 is at 120°, so coordinates (cos120, sin120)= (-0.5, sqrt(3)/2).

Vector is (-1.5, sqrt(3)/2).

Next vector from V4 to V5 (step1): V5 is at 150°, coordinates (cos150, sin150)= (-sqrt(3)/2, 0.5).

Vector is (-sqrt(3)/2 - (-0.5), 0.5 - sqrt(3)/2).

Compute

---------------

 components:

x: (-sqrt(3)/2 +0.5) ≈ (-0.866 +0.5)= -0.366

y: 0.5 -0.866≈-0.366

Dot product with first vector:

(-1.5)(-0.366) + (0.866)(-0.366) ≈0.549 -0.317≈0.232 ≠0. Not perpendicular.

So no.

Another

---------------

 possible pair: steps 6 and 3:

Already squares.

Thus, I think the total is indeed 13. 

Wait but I have

---------------

 to check for another possible rectangle type. 

Wait, let's think of steps 2 and 6. 

Steps2 and6:

V

---------------

0 to V2 (step2), then V2 to V8 (step6). 

Vector1: V2 - V0 = (cos60-1, sin60)

Vector2: V8 - V2 = (cos240 - cos60, sin240 - sin60)

Compute components

---------------

:

cos60=0.5, sin60≈0.866

cos240=cos(180+60)= -0.5, sin240= -0.866

Vector1: (-0.5, 0.866)

Vector2: (-0.5 -0.5, -0.866 -0.866)= (-1, -1.732)

Dot product: (-0.5)(-1) + (0.866)(-1.732) ≈0.5 -1.5≈-1 ≠0. Not perpendicular.

So

---------------

 no. 

Another possible rectangle: steps 3 and 6 (already counted as squares).

Thus, I think the total is 13. 

However, let

---------------

 me think again of steps1 and5 rectangles count:

Each starting vertex gives a new rectangle, and since there are 12 vertices, but each rectangle has 4 vertices, each

---------------

 rectangle is counted 4 times (once per vertex). So total number is 12/4=3. But earlier

---------------

 analysis suggested 6, which contradicts.

Wait, the rectangle starting at V0 is V0,V1,V6,V5. 



---------------

Starting at V1 gives V1,V2,V7,V6.

Starting at V2 gives V2,V3,V8,V7.

Starting

---------------

 at V3 gives V3,V4,V9,V8.

Starting at V4 gives V4,V5,V10,V9.

Starting at V5 gives V5,V6,V11,V10.

Starting at V6 gives V6,V7,V0,V5.

Wait

---------------

, but V6's rectangle is V6,V7,V0,V5 which is the same as the rectangle starting at V0 but in

---------------

 reverse. So they are the same rectangle. 

Similarly, V7 would give V7,V8,V1,V6 which is the same as starting at V1's rectangle. 

Therefore, each rectangle is counted twice (once in each direction). So total rectangles of

---------------

 this type are 6/2=3. 

Wait, so if I start at V0, the rectangle is counted

---------------

 when starting at V0 and V5. 

Similarly, each rectangle has two starting points (each vertex can be the start, but the

---------------

 rectangle is the same in reverse). 

Therefore, the actual number of distinct rectangles for steps1 and5 is 6/2=3. 

Similarly

---------------

 for steps2 and4:

Starting at V0, V1, V2, V3 give four rectangles, but each rectangle is counted four times (once per vertex). Wait no, let's see:

The rectangle V0, V2, V6, V8 can be started at any of its four vertices. So each rectangle is counted four times in the total

---------------

 12 starting points. 

Thus the number of distinct rectangles is 12/(4)=3. 

Wait but earlier I

---------------

 thought there were 4 distinct rectangles, but perhaps not. 

Wait let me list them:

1. V0, V2, V6, V8

2. V1, V3, V7, V9

3. V2, V4, V8, V10

4. V3, V5, V9, V11

These

---------------

 are four distinct rectangles. Each has four vertices, so total vertices counted are 4*4=16, but there are only 12 vertices. Wait

---------------

, this is impossible. 

Wait, actually, each vertex is part of multiple rectangles. 

For example, V0 is in rectangle1 and also

---------------

 in rectangle4 (if any), but rectangle4 is V3, V5, V9, V11, which doesn't include V0. 

Wait

---------------

 each rectangle has 4 unique vertices, and there are four distinct rectangles:

1. V0, V2, V6, V8

2. V1, V3, V7, V9

3. V2, V4, V8, V10

4. V3, V5, V9, V11

These four rectangles don

---------------

't overlap in vertices except at edges, but each uses distinct sets. 

Wait, but the total vertices used are 4*4=16, but there are only 12 vertices. 



---------------

Indeed, rectangle1 uses V0, V2, V6, V8.

Rectangle2 uses V1, V3, V7, V9.

Rectangle3 uses V2, V4, V8, V10.

Rectangle4 uses V3, V5, V9, V11.

Thus, vertices V2 and V8 are in both rectangle1 and3.

V3 and V9 are in both rectangle2 and4.

V

---------------

8 is in1 and3.

V9 is in2 and4.

V4 and V10 are only in rectangle3.

V5 and V11 are in4.

V0, V6 in1.

V1, V7 in2.

So

---------------

 overlapping vertices, but rectangles are still distinct. 

Thus, there are indeed four distinct rectangles of this type. 

Similarly for steps1 and5:

The four distinct rectangles would be:

1. V0, V1, V6, V5

2. V1, V2, V7, V6

3. V2, V3, V8, V7

4. V3, V4, V9, V8

Wait, but these

---------------

 share vertices. 

Wait no, let me see:

Actually, the steps1 and5 rectangles are:

Each rectangle is determined

---------------

 by a starting point and then taking step1 and step5 alternately. 

The four distinct rectangles would be:

1. V0, V1, V6, V5

2. V2, V3, V8, V7

3. V4, V5, V10, V9

4. V6, V7, V0, V11 (wait, no

---------------

)

Hmm, this is getting too tangled. 

Alternatively, perhaps the count for steps1 and5 is also 4.

---------------

 

Wait, let's see:

Starting at V0: rectangle A.

Starting at V2: rectangle B.

Starting at V4: rectangle C.

Starting at V6: rectangle D.

Starting

---------------

 at V8: rectangle E.

Starting at V10: rectangle F.

But each rectangle is separated by two steps. 

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 there are 6 distinct rectangles for steps1 and5, but when considering the overlap and rotational symmetry, it's actually 6. 

Alternatively

---------------

, since there are 12 vertices and each rectangle uses 4, with no overlaps, but they do overlap, so the

---------------

 count is more complex. 

This is getting too time-consuming. Given the time I've spent, I think the total number of rectangles is:

- 3 squares,

- 4 rectangles with steps2 and4,

- 6 rectangles with steps1 and5,

Total:13.

But I might

---------------

 have overcounted steps1 and5. 

Alternatively, if steps1 and5 give 6 rectangles, steps2 and4 give4, and squares3, total is13.

Alternatively, if

---------------

 steps1 and5 give4, steps2 and4 give4, squares3: total11.

Alternatively, I might

---------------

 have made a mistake in the steps1 and5 count. Let me try to count them properly:

Each rectangle with steps1 and5 is determined by two

---------------

 steps: first a step1, then a step5, etc. 

The rectangle starting at V0 is:

V0 →

---------------

 V1 (step1), V1→V6 (step5), V6→V5 (step-1=11), V5→V0 (step5).



---------------

This rectangle includes vertices V0, V1, V6, V5.

Another rectangle starting at V1:

V1→V2, V2→V7, V7→V6, V6→V1.

Vertices

---------------

 V1, V2, V7, V6.

Starting at V2:

V2→V3, V3→V8, V8→V7, V7→V2.

Vertices V2, V3, V8, V7.

Starting at V3:

V3→V4, V4→V9, V9→V8, V8→V3.

Vertices V3, V4, V9, V8.

Starting at V4:

V4→V5, V5→V10, V10→V9, V9→V4.

Vertices V4, V5, V10, V9.

Starting at V5:

V5→V6, V6→V11, V11→V10, V10→V5.

Vertices V5, V6, V11, V10.

Starting at V6:

V6→V7, V7→V0 (step5 from V7 is V7+5=12→

---------------

0), V0→V11 (step-1), V11→V6.

Which is the same as rectangle starting at V5 but

---------------

 rotated.

Thus, there are 6 distinct rectangles of this type. 

Therefore total rectangles are 3+4+6=13.

Hence, the final answer is 13,

---------------

 so \boxed{13}.

Wait, but I recall that in some resources, the number of rectangles in a dodecagon is 20. Hmm, maybe I missed some cases.

Wait another possible rectangle type: steps 4 and 2 in

---------------

 the other direction? Or other step combinations.

Wait, let's consider steps 3 and 6 (diameters).

---------------

 

Wait, a rectangle can have sides of step3 and step6? 

For example, V0, V3 (step3), V3 to V9 (step6), V9 to V12=V0 (step3). But

---------------

 this forms a square, already counted.

Another idea: rectangles with sides of steps 2 and 6.

Steps2 and6:

V0→V2 (step2), then V2→V8 (step6). 

Vector from V0 to V2 is (-0.5,0.866).

Vector from V2 to V8 is (cos240 - cos60, sin240 - sin60)= (-0.5-0.5, -0.866-0.866)= (-1, -1.732).

Dot product: (-0.5)(-1) + (0.866)(-1.732) ≈0.5 -1.5≈-1≠0. Not perpendicular.

Thus

---------------

 no.

Steps4 and6:

V0→V4 (step4), V4→V10 (step6). 

Vector1: (cos120 -1, sin120)

---------------

 = (-1.5, 0.866).

Vector2: (cos240 - cos120, sin240 - sin120) = (-0.5 - (-0.5), -0.866 -0.866)= (0, -1.732).

Dot product: (-1.5)(0) + (0.866)(-1.732)= -1.5≠0.

Not perpendicular.

Steps5 and6:

V0→V5 (step5), V5→V11 (step6). 

Vector1: (cos150 -1, sin150) = (-sqrt(3)/2 -1, 0.5).

Vector2: (cos330 - cos150, sin330 - sin150)= (0.866 - (-0.866), -0.5 -0.5)= (1.732, -1).

Dot product: [(-sqrt(3)/2 -1)(1.732)] + [0.5*(-1)] 

This is complicated

---------------

 but likely not zero.

Thus no.

Another possible pair: steps3 and 1.

V0→V3 (step3), then V3→V4 (step1). 

Vector1: (cos90 -1, sin90)= (0-1,1)= (-1,1).

Vector2: (cos120 - cos90, sin120 - sin90)= (-0.5 -0, 0.866-1)= (-0.5, -0.134).

Dot product: (-1)(-0.5) + (1)(-0.134)=0.5 -0.134≈0.366≠0.

Not perpendicular.

Steps2 and 

---------------

3:

V0→V2 (step2), V2→V5 (step3). 

Vector1: (-0.5,0.866).

Vector2: (cos150 -0.5, sin150 -0.866)= (-0.866-0.5, 0.5 -0.866)= (-1.366, -0.366).

Dot product: (-0.5)(-1.366) + (0.866)(-0.366)=0.683 -0.317≈0.366≠0.

Thus, no.

Therefore

---------------

, I think the total is indeed 13. 

Wait, but let me check online if possible. 

Wait I can't access external resources, but I

---------------

 recall that in a regular dodecagon, the number of rectangles is calculated as follows:

For rectangles, you need two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular polygon with n sides, the number of rectangles is the number of ways to choose two pairs of perpendicular directions and

---------------

 then count the intersections. 

But in this case, since the rectangle sides must lie on sides or diagonals, it's more constrained

---------------

. 

Alternatively, the formula might be:

For each pair of perpendicular diagonals (or sides), the number of rectangles is the number of intersections

---------------

 they form. 

But this requires knowing all perpendicular pairs. 

Alternatively, another approach: 

Each rectangle is determined by two pairs of parallel chords, each pair perpendicular to the other. 

In a regular dodecagon, the possible perpendicular

---------------

 pairs of step counts are:

- (1,5)

- (2,4)

- (3,3)

These

---------------

 are the only pairs where their direction angles are 90° apart. 

For each such pair (k,m), the number of rectangles is calculated

---------------

 by the number of ways to choose two pairs of parallel chords of steps k and m that form a rectangle. 

For pair

---------------

 (3,3):

This forms squares. The number is 12 / (4) =3 (since each square has 4 vertices and the

---------------

 dodecagon has 12 vertices, but each square is counted once every 4 vertices). 

For pair (2,4):

To

---------------

 form a rectangle with steps2 and4, we need two pairs of parallel chords of steps2 and4. 

The number of such rectangles is calculated by choosing a starting vertex and then stepping

---------------

 appropriately, but accounting for overlaps. 

There are 12 starting vertices, but each rectangle has 4 vertices, so 12/4=3, but since each

---------------

 rectangle can be started at any of its four vertices, the total is 12/(4)=3. But earlier analysis suggested

---------------

 4. 

Wait, perhaps for steps2 and4, the number is 12/(gcd(2,4)*something

). Not sure. 

Alternatively, the number of rectangles for steps2 and4 is equal to the number of ways to choose two perpendicular directions (steps2 and4) and the number of positions. 

Each

---------------

 rectangle is determined by a vertex and the step counts, but due to symmetry, the count is 12/(number of vertices

---------------

 per rectangle / rotational symmetry). 

Alternatively, for steps2 and4, the rectangle is formed every 3 vertices (since 3 steps give

---------------

 a square), but not sure. 

Alternatively, the number is 12/(steps between repeats). 

If starting at V0, the next unique rectangle starts at V1, then

---------------

 V2, V3, and then V4 gives the first rectangle rotated 120°, but since the rectangle has

---------------

 a period of 4 vertices, maybe it's 12/ (4 gcd(2,4))? Not sure. 

Alternatively, the

---------------

 number of rectangles for steps2 and4 is 12/ (steps between repeats). 

Each rectangle is separated by 1 vertex, so after

---------------

 4 vertices, it repeats? 

Wait, the first rectangle is V0, V2, V6, V8.

The next starts at V1: V1, V3, V7, V9.

Then

---------------

 V2: V2, V4, V8, V10.

Then V3: V3, V5, V9, V11.

Then V4: V4, V6, V10, V0 → same as first rectangle

---------------

 rotated.

Thus, there are 4 distinct rectangles.

Similarly for steps1 and5:

Each rectangle is separated by 1 vertex, so

---------------

 starting at V0, V1, V2,… up to V5 gives 6 distinct rectangles before repeating. 

Thus

---------------

 6 rectangles.

Therefore total is 3+4+6=13. 

Therefore, I will go with 13 as the answer.

But I have

---------------

 a doubt because I recall that in a regular dodecagon, the number of rectangles might be higher. But given the analysis

---------------

, I think it's 13.

Wait another thought: the problem says "each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon". The

---------------

 sides of the rectangle must be along existing sides or diagonals. 

In the case of squares (step3), each side is a diagonal of the dodecagon (step3,

---------------

 central angle90°), which is valid. 

The rectangles with steps2 and4: their sides are step2 (central60°) and step4 (central120°), both are valid diagonals. 

The rectangles with steps1 and5: step1 is a side (3

---------------

0°), and step5 is a diagonal (150°). So sides can be sides or diagonals, so these

---------------

 are valid. 

Thus, total 13. 

Alternatively, perhaps I missed the rectangles with sides of step6 (diameters) and step3 (which

---------------

 form squares). 

But squares are already counted. 

So final answer is \boxed{13}.


To find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we consider the following steps:

1. **Squares (step 3 and 3):**
   - A square is formed by vertices separated by 3 steps (central angle 90°).
   - There are 3 distinct squares because each square is counted every 3 vertices around

---------------

 the dodecagon.
   - **Count:** 3

2. **Rectangles with steps 2 and 4:**
   - These rectangles are formed by vertices separated by 2 steps (central angle 60°) and 4 steps (central angle 120°).
   - Each rectangle is counted every 1 vertex, leading to 4 distinct rectangles.
   - **Count:** 4

3. **Rectangles with steps 1 and 5:**
   - These rectangles are formed by vertices separated by 1 step (a side, central angle 30°) and 5 steps (central angle 150°).
   - Each rectangle is counted every 1 vertex, leading to 6 distinct rectangles.
   - **Count:** 6

Summing these counts gives the total number of rectangles:

\[
3 \text{ (squares)} + 4 \text{ (steps 2 and 4)} + 6 \text{ (steps 1 and 5)} = 13
\]

Thus, the number of rectangles is \(\boxed{13}\).<|im_end|>
