Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first, and each turn they can take either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many numbers n ≤ 2024 are such that Bob has a winning strategy no matter what Alice does. Hmm, so

---------------

 essentially, for those n, Bob can always win if Alice plays optimally, but actually, regardless of Alice's moves,

---------------

 right? Wait, no, the problem says "regardless of Alice's play", so Bob can win even if Alice is trying to mess

---------------

 him up. So those n are the losing positions for Alice, meaning that if the game starts at such an n, then

---------------

 no matter what Alice does, Bob can force a win.

Right, so I need to figure out all the losing positions for the first player (Alice)

---------------

 up to 2024. Then the count of those will be the answer. To do this, I think I need

---------------

 to model this as a game with states, where each state is a number of tokens, and each state is either a winning or losing position. A position is a losing position if all moves from it lead to a winning position for the opponent. Conversely, a winning position is one where there exists at least one move to a losing position for the opponent.

Let me start by working

---------------

 out the small cases manually to see if there's a pattern.

Let's denote:

- Let’s define P(n) as true if the current player can force a win with n tokens remaining, and false otherwise.

We

---------------

 need to find for which n P(n) is false (since those are the positions where the current player cannot force a win, so if Alice starts at such an n, Bob can win).

Base cases:

- n = 0: The

---------------

 game is over, so the previous player has won. So if n=0, the current player cannot move, so this

---------------

 is a losing position. But since the game ends when the last token is taken, maybe n=0 is not considered a

---------------

 valid position. Wait, actually, when the last token is taken, the player who took it wins, so n=0 is

---------------

 a terminal state with no moves. So if it's your turn and n=0, you lose because you can't move. So

---------------

 P(0) is a losing position (since current player can't move and loses).

But for n=1:

- If

---------------

 there's 1 token, the current player takes it and wins. So P(1)=true.

n=2:

- Current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then can take the last one and win. Alternatively, taking

---------------

 4 is impossible. So the only move is to take 1, leading to n=1 for the opponent. Since P(1) is true, that means the opponent can win.

---------------

 Therefore, if current player takes 1, opponent can win. Therefore, the current player has no winning move. Wait, that

---------------

 would mean P(2) is false? Wait, hold on:

Wait, the current player at n=2 can only take 1 token, leaving n=1 for the opponent. Since P

---------------

(1) is true, that means the opponent can win from n=1, so the current player's move leads the opponent to a winning position. Since

---------------

 there are no other moves (can't take 4), the current player cannot force a win. Therefore, P(2)=false?

---------------

 Wait, but that would mean that n=2 is a losing position. Hmm, but let me confirm:

Wait, when

---------------

 at n=2, current player takes 1, opponent gets n=1 and takes the last token to win. So

---------------

 yes, current player can't force a win. So P(2)=false.

Wait, so n=2 is a losing position.

---------------

 So Bob would win if Alice starts at n=2? Wait, actually, in the problem, the question is for n

---------------

 where Bob can win regardless of Alice's play. So if n is a losing position for the first player (Alice), then Bob can win. So the

---------------

 losing positions for the first player are the n where Bob can win. Therefore, we need to count all n ≤2024 where P(n) is false.

Continuing:

n=3:

Current player can take 1, leaving n=2 (which is a losing position for the opponent). Since P

---------------

(2)=false, that means the opponent cannot win from n=2, so current player can force a win by moving to n=2. Therefore P(3)=true.

Alternatively, taking

---------------

 4 is impossible here. So only move is to take 1, leading to n=2. Since n=2 is losing for the opponent, so

---------------

 yes, P(3)=true.

n=4:

Current player can take 4 tokens and win immediately. So P(4)=true.

n=5:

Current player can choose to take 1, leaving n=4 (which is a winning position for opponent),

---------------

 or take 4, leaving n=1 (also a winning position for opponent, since P(1)=true). Therefore

---------------

, all moves from n=5 lead to opponent's win. Thus P(5)=false. Wait, really?

Wait, if

---------------

 at n=5, the current player takes 1, leaving 4. Then opponent can take all 4 and win. Alternatively, if

---------------

 current player takes 4 from 5, leaving 1, opponent takes 1 and wins. So regardless of the move, opponent can win. Therefore

---------------

, P(5)=false. So n=5 is a losing position.

n=6:

Current player can take 1, leaving n=5 (which is a losing position for opponent). Since P(5)=false, that

---------------

 move is a winning move. Therefore, P(6)=true.

Alternatively, taking 4 from 6 leaves n=2 (which is losing for opponent as well, since P(2)=false). So

---------------

 actually, there are two moves leading to losing positions for opponent. So definitely P(6)=true.

Wait, so taking

---------------

 either 1 or 4 from 6 both lead to losing positions for the opponent. So yes, P(6)=true.

n=7:

Current

---------------

 player can take 1, leaving n=6 (which is a winning position for opponent). Or take 4, leaving n=3 (which is also a winning position for opponent,

---------------

 since P(3)=true). Therefore, all moves from n=7 lead to opponent's win. Thus P(7)=false.

Wait, so

---------------

 P(7)=false? Let me check:

Taking 1 from 7 gives 6, which is a winning position for

---------------

 opponent (they can win from there). Taking 4 from 7 gives 3, which is also a winning position for

---------------

 opponent. Therefore, current player can't force a win. So P(7)=false.

n=8:

Current player can take 1, leaving n=7 (which is a losing position for opponent). Since

---------------

 P(7)=false, that's a winning move. So P(8)=true.

Alternatively, taking 4 leaves n=4, which is a winning position for opponent (they can take all 4 and win). But since there's

---------------

 at least one move to a losing position (taking 1 to 7), then P(8)=true.

n=9:

Take

---------------

 1 → n=8 (P(8)=true, opponent can win). Take 4 → n=5 (P(5)=false, so

---------------

 opponent can't win). Therefore, if current player takes 4, leaving n=5 (a losing position), so P

---------------

(9)=true.

Wait, so taking 4 from 9 leaves n=5 which is a losing position for opponent. Therefore

---------------

, P(9)=true.

Wait, so P(9)=true.

n=10:

Take 1 → n=9 (P(9)=true).

---------------

 Take 4 → n=6 (P(6)=true). So both moves lead to opponent's win. Therefore, P(10)=false.

Hmm

---------------

, so n=10 is a losing position.

Wait, let me tabulate these so far:

n : P(n)

0 : False

---------------

 (terminal, can't move)

1 : True

2 : False

3 : True

4 : True

5 : False

6 : True

7 : False

8 : True

9 : True

10: False

Hmm, let

---------------

's see if there's a pattern here. Let me write out more terms to see.

n=11:

Take 1 → 10 (P= False

---------------

). So opponent is in a losing position. Therefore, current player can win by taking 1. Thus P(11)=True.

Alternatively

---------------

, taking 4 → 7 (P=False). So either way, there are moves to losing positions. So P(11)=True.

n=12:

Take 1 → 11 (True). Take 4 → 8 (True). So

---------------

 all moves lead to opponent's win? Wait, no. Wait, opponent can win from those positions. So if current player moves

---------------

 to 11 or 8, opponent can win. Therefore, P(12)=False? Wait, but let

---------------

 me check again:

Wait, if current player takes 1 from 12 to get 11. Since P(11)=True, that

---------------

 means opponent can win from 11. Similarly, taking 4 from 12 to get 8 (P(8)=True,

---------------

 opponent can win). Therefore, all moves lead to opponent's win, so P(12)=False.

Wait, so P(12)=False.

n=13:

Take 1 → 12 (False). So opponent

---------------

 is in losing position. Therefore, current player can win by taking 1. So P(13)=True.

n

---------------

=14:

Take 1 →13 (True). Take 4 →10 (False). So taking 4 leads

---------------

 to opponent's losing position. Therefore, P(14)=True.

n=15:

Take 1 →14 (True). Take 4 →11 (True). Both

---------------

 moves lead to opponent's winning positions. Thus P(15)=False?

Wait, let's check:

If n=15, taking

---------------

 1 leads to 14 (which is a winning position for opponent, so opponent can win). Taking 4 leads to 11 (also a winning position for opponent). Therefore

---------------

, all moves lead to opponent's win. So P(15)=False.

n=16:

Take 1 →15 (False). So opponent

---------------

 is in losing position. So current can take 1 and win. So P(16)=True.

n=17:

Take 1 →16 (True). Take 4 →13 (True). All

---------------

 moves lead to opponent's win. Therefore P(17)=False?

Wait, wait. Wait, taking 1 from

---------------

 17 gives n=16 (P= True), so opponent can win. Taking 4 gives n=13 (P=True), so

---------------

 opponent can also win. Therefore, all moves lead to opponent's win. Thus P(17)=False.

Wait, but that

---------------

 contradicts previous pattern. Let me check again:

Wait n=16: P(16)=True. So from

---------------

 17, taking 1 leads to 16 (True), so opponent can win. Taking 4 leads to 13 (True), so

---------------

 opponent can win. Therefore, yes, P(17)=False.

Hmm, so let's see the sequence so far:



---------------

n : P(n)

0: F

1: T

2: F

3: T

4: T

5: F

6: T

7: F

8: T

9: T

10:F

11:T

12:F

13:T

14:T

15:F

16:T

17:F

Hmm, trying

---------------

 to see the pattern here. Let's list the losing positions (F):

n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,...

Looking at the differences between these

---------------

 numbers:

From 0 to 2: +2

2 to 5: +3

5 to7: +2

7 to10:+3

10 to12:+2

12 to15:+3

15 to17:+2

So the

---------------

 pattern seems to be alternating between adding 2 and 3? Let me see:

Starting at 0:

0 +2 =2



---------------

2 +3=5

5 +2=7

7+3=10

10+2=12

12+3=15

15+2=17

17+3=20?



---------------

Wait, let's check n=18, 19, etc. to see.

Wait let's compute a few more terms to

---------------

 confirm.

n=17 is F.

n=18:

Take 1 →17 (F). So opponent is in losing position. Therefore

---------------

, current can take 1 and force opponent to F. So P(18)=True.

n=19:

Take 1 →18 (True). Take4 →15 (F). So taking 4 to

---------------

 get to 15 (F). So opponent is in F. Therefore, P(19)=True.

Wait, so taking

---------------

 4 from 19 leads to 15 (F). So P(19)=True.

n=20:

Take1 →19 (True). Take4→16 (True). So

---------------

 both moves lead to opponent's win. Therefore P(20)=False.

Ah, so n=20 is F. So

---------------

 the next term after 17 is 20 (difference of +3). Then:

20 +2=22?



---------------

Let me check n=21:

Take1→20 (F). So P(21)=True.

n=22:

Take1→21 (True). Take4→18 (True). So

---------------

 both moves lead to opponent's win. Thus P(22)=False. So 22 is F, which is 20+2.

---------------

 Then 22+3=25?

Continuing:

n=23:

Take1→22 (False). So P

---------------

(23)=True.

n=24:

Take1→23 (True). Take4→20 (False). So taking

---------------

4 leads to F. Thus P(24)=True.

n=25:

Take1→24 (True). Take4→21 (True). Both moves lead to opponent's win. So

---------------

 P(25)=False.

So yes, the pattern of losing positions is every 2 and 3 alternately:

---------------

 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,...



---------------

So the losing positions are numbers congruent to 2 or 0 mod something? Wait, perhaps the losing positions follow a cycle of 5? Let me see:



---------------

Looking at the differences between consecutive losing positions:

2-0=2

5-2=3

7-5=2

10-7=3

12-10=2

15-12=3

17-15=2

20-17=3

22-20=2

25-22=3

So the

---------------

 pattern is +2, +3, +2, +3,... repeating every 2 steps. So the losing positions are generated

---------------

 by starting at 0 and alternately adding 2 and 3. So the sequence is 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22, 25, 27,... etc.

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps the losing positions can be expressed as numbers of the form 5k + 2 and 5k? Wait,

---------------

 let me see:

Looking at the numbers:

0 = 5*0 +0

2 =5*0 +2

5=5*1 +0

7=5*1 +2

10=5*2 +0

12=5*2 +2

15=5*3+0

17=5*3+2

20=5*4 +0

22=5*4 +2

25=5*5 +0

27=5*5 +2



---------------

So yes! It seems that the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod 5. Wait,

---------------

 0 mod5 and 2 mod5. Let me check:

Take n=5: 5 mod5=0 →

---------------

 yes, it is a losing position? Wait, n=5 was a losing position (P(5)=False). 

---------------

5 mod5=0.

n=2 mod5=2: yes, 2 is a losing position. 7 mod5=2,

---------------

 12 mod5=2, etc. So the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5?



---------------

Wait, let me check n=10: 10 mod5=0, which is a losing position (P

---------------

(10)=False). n=12 mod5=2, which is losing (P(12)=False). n=15 mod5=0, yes

---------------

. n=17 mod5=2, yes. So that seems to hold. Wait, but n=0 is 

---------------

0 mod5, which is a losing position.

Wait, but let me check n=20, which is 0 mod5,

---------------

 and n=22 is 2 mod5, etc. So the pattern is indeed numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.

---------------

 Wait, but let me confirm with n=25 (25 mod5=0, which is losing). n=27 mod5=2 (losing

---------------

). So that seems consistent.

Wait but let me check n=1: 1 mod5=1, which is a winning position.

---------------

 n=3 mod5=3, which is winning. n=4 mod5=4, which is winning. So the

---------------

 losing positions are exactly those n where n mod5 is 0 or 2. Therefore, for any n, if n mod5 is 0 or 2, then it's a losing position (P

---------------

(n)=False). Therefore, Bob can win if n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Therefore, the problem reduces to counting numbers ≤2024 where

---------------

 n mod5 is 0 or 2.

Wait, but let me confirm with some earlier numbers. For example n=7 mod

---------------

5=2, which was a losing position, correct. n=5 mod0, losing. n=10 mod

---------------

0, losing. n=12 mod2, losing. So that seems to hold.

Wait, but let me check n=17

---------------

 mod5=2 (17 divided by5 is 3*5=15, so 17-15=2).

---------------

 Yes, so mod5=2. So that works. So the losing positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5. Therefore

---------------

, the numbers n where Bob can force a win are exactly the numbers ≡0 or 2 mod5. So the

---------------

 answer is the number of integers ≤2024 congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.

Therefore, to

---------------

 compute that, we can calculate:

Number of numbers ≤2024 ≡0 mod5: floor(2024/5)



---------------

Plus the number of numbers ≤2024 ≡2 mod5: floor((2024 -2)/5) +1 (

---------------

if 2024 mod5 ≥2)

Wait, let's compute each separately.

First, numbers ≡0 mod5:



---------------

The numbers are 5,10,15,..., up to the largest multiple of 5 ≤2024.

The largest multiple of 5 ≤2024 is 2020 (since 2024 divided by5 is 404.8, so 404*5=2020).

---------------

 So the count is 2020 /5=404 numbers. But wait, starting from 0? Wait, but

---------------

 n is positive integers, so starting from n=5, but the problem says "positive integers n less than or equal to 2024". So

---------------

 n starts at 1. Wait, but 0 isn't included. Wait, the losing positions include n=0, but n

---------------

 must be positive. So for n≥1, the losing positions are n≡0 or 2 mod5, except 

---------------

0. Wait, n=0 is not a positive integer. So the losing positions from n=1 to 2024 are numbers

---------------

 congruent to 0 or 2 mod5, except 0. So 0 is excluded, so starting from n=2,5,7,10,...

---------------

 up to 2024.

Therefore, the count for numbers ≡0 mod5 from 1 to 2024:



---------------

The first number is 5, then 10,...,2020. So total numbers: (2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404.

---------------

 So that's same as 2020/5=404.

Numbers ≡2 mod5 from 1 to2024:

The

---------------

 numbers are 2,7,12,..., up to the largest number ≤2024 and ≡2 mod5.

Let

---------------

 me find the largest such number:

2024 divided by5: 5×404=2020, so 2020 +

---------------

4=2024. So 2024 mod5 is 4. So the largest number ≡2 mod5 less than or equal to2024 is 2024 - (4-2)=2024-2=2022? Wait,

---------------

 2022 mod5: 2020 is 0, so 2022 is 2 mod5. Yes.

---------------

 So 2022 is the last term.

So the sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022.

This

---------------

 is an arithmetic progression with first term a=2, common difference d=5, last term l=2022.

The number of terms is given by:



---------------

n = ((l - a)/d ) +1 = ((2022 -2)/5) +1 = (2020)/5 +1 = 404 +1 =405.

Wait, 

---------------

2020 divided by5 is 404, so 404+1=405 terms.

Wait,

---------------

 let me verify with another approach. The nth term of the sequence is 2 +5(k-1). So 2 +5(k-1) ≤2024.

S

---------------

olving for k:

5(k-1) ≤2022

k-1 ≤2022/5=404.4

k

---------------

-1 ≤404.4 ⇒k ≤405.4, so k=405.

Yes

---------------

, so 405 terms.

Therefore, total losing positions are 404 (for 0 mod5) +405 (for 2 mod5)

---------------

 = 809.

Wait, but hold on, does n=0 count? Since n must be a positive integer,

---------------

 so n=0 is excluded. However, in our losing positions for n≥1, the numbers congruent to 0 mod5 start at 5, so

---------------

 the count for 0 mod5 is indeed 404, as 5 to2020. The numbers congruent to 2 mod5 start at 2, so 

---------------

2,7,...,2022, which is 405 numbers. Thus total is 404+405=809.

Wait, but let me check with

---------------

 a smaller number to see if the formula works. Let's take n up to 10.

Numbers ≤10 where

---------------

 n≡0 or 2 mod5:

0 mod5: 5,10 → 2 numbers (but 

---------------

0 excluded, so starting at 5). Wait 5 and10 are two numbers (since 10 is included).

---------------

 So count is 2 (for 0 mod5).

For 2 mod5: 2,7 → two numbers.

---------------

 So total is 4.

But according to the problem's losing positions up to n=10:

The losing positions are

---------------

 2,5,7,10. So that's 4 numbers, which matches 2+2=4. So

---------------

 formula works here.

Wait, using the formula for n=10:

Numbers ≡0 mod5: floor(10/5)=2 (5,10).



---------------

Numbers ≡2 mod5: floor((10-2)/5)+1= (8)/5=1.6 →

---------------

 floor 1 +1=2 (2 and7). So total 2+2=4. Correct.

Another test with

---------------

 n=7:

Numbers ≤7 losing positions:2,5,7. Wait, but according to the formula:

Numbers≡

---------------

0 mod5: floor(7/5)=1 (5).

Numbers≡2 mod5: floor((7-2)/5)+1=

---------------

 (5)/5=1 +1=2 (2 and7). So total 1+2=3. Which matches (

---------------

2,5,7). So correct.

Wait but in the losing positions up to n=7, 7 is included.

---------------

 So the formula works here. So seems okay.

So applying this to 2024:

Numbers≡0 mod5: 404



---------------

Numbers≡2 mod5: 405

Total: 809.

Wait, but let me check the

---------------

 count for numbers ≡2 mod5 again. The first term is 2, last term 2022, difference 5. The formula gives

---------------

 (2022-2)/5 +1 = 2020/5 +1=404 +1=405. Correct

---------------

.

Similarly for the 0 mod5, first term 5, last term 2020: (2020-5)/5 +1=2015/5 +1=403 +1=404. Correct.

Thus

---------------

 total is 809. So the answer should be 809? Wait, but let me check with another

---------------

 approach to be sure.

Alternative approach: For numbers from 1 to N, the count of numbers ≡a mod m is floor((N -a)/m) +1, provided a ≤N.

So

---------------

 for mod5, residues 0 and2.

For residue 0:

Numbers from 1 to2024.

---------------

 The first number ≡0 mod5 is 5, last is 2020.

Number of terms: ((2020 -5)/5)+1 = (2015/5)+1=403+1=404. Correct.

For residue2:

First number 2, last number 2022.

Number of terms: ((2022 -2)/5)+1=

---------------

2020/5 +1=404+1=405. Correct.

Total: 404+405=809.

Therefore

---------------

, the answer should be 809. But let me check with the initial terms.

Wait, but in the problem

---------------

 statement, it says "the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024". So n starts

---------------

 at1. So the losing positions are those n where P(n)=False, which are exactly n≡0 or2 mod5,

---------------

 excluding 0. So that's correct. So 809 is the answer. Hmm, but wait, let me check

---------------

 n=2 mod5. The first term is 2, which is included, so yes.

Wait, but let me check

---------------

 n=2024. Since 2024 mod5 is 2024 divided by5: 5×404=2020, so 2024-2020=4. So 2024 mod5=4. Therefore

---------------

, 2024 is not in either residue class, so it's excluded. So the last term for residue2 is 2022,

---------------

 which is okay.

Alternatively, maybe there's an off-by-one error? Let me see:

Wait, 2024 is

---------------

 the upper limit. So when counting numbers ≡2 mod5 up to 2024, since 2022 is the last one,

---------------

 which is less than 2024, that's correct. So 405 terms. So total 809.

Wait

---------------

, but let me see another way. The total numbers from1 to2024 is2024 numbers. The losing

---------------

 positions are 2 out of every 5 numbers. So the proportion is 2/5. So approximate total would be 2024*(2/5)=8

---------------

09.6. Since we can't have a fraction, and depending on how the residues fall, it's either 809 or 810. Since our

---------------

 calculation gives exactly 809, that makes sense. So I think that's correct.

Therefore, the answer is 809. So

---------------

 I'll put \boxed{809}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{809}


To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to identify the losing positions for the first player (Alice). A position \( n \) is a losing position if every possible move (taking 1 or 4 tokens) leads to a winning position for the opponent.

By analyzing small cases and identifying patterns, we observe that the losing positions follow a periodic pattern modulo 5. Specifically, the losing positions are those \( n \) such that \( n \equiv 0 \) or \( 2 \pmod{5} \).

To verify

---------------

 this:
- For \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), the losing positions are 5, 10, 15, ..., 2020.
- For \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \), the losing positions are 2, 7, 12, ..., 2022.

Calcul

---------------

ating the counts:
1. **Numbers \( \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \)**:
   - The sequence is 5, 10, 15, ..., 2020.
   - The number of terms is \( \frac{2020}{5} = 404 \).

2. **Numbers \( \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \)**:
   - The sequence is 2, 7, 12, ..., 2022.
   - The number of terms is \( \frac{2022 - 2}{5} + 1 = \frac{2020}{5} + 1 = 404 + 1 = 405 \).

Summing these counts gives the total number of losing positions:
\[ 404 + 405 = 809 \]

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy is \(\boxed{809}\).<|im_end|>
