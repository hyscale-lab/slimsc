Okay, let's tackle this probability problem. Hmm, Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from S = {1, 2, ..., 10}. Then 4 numbers are randomly chosen, and she wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the chosen ones. The grand prize is when all four of her numbers are chosen. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. Alright, let's break this down.

First, let

---------------

 me recall that conditional probability is involved here. The formula is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B)/P(B). In

---------------

 this case, event A is "winning the grand prize" and event B is "winning a prize." Since winning the grand prize automatically means she also

---------------

 won a prize, A is a subset of B. Therefore, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So the probability we need is P(A)/P(B).

So,

---------------

 first, let's compute P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. That's straightforward. Since she has to pick

---------------

 exactly the 4 numbers that are chosen. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 10 is C(10,4). The number of favorable outcomes is 1 (her specific set). So P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).

Now

---------------

, P(B) is the probability of winning a prize, which is at least two correct numbers. So we need the probability that exactly 2, 3, or 4 of her numbers are among the chosen ones. Since

---------------

 these are mutually exclusive, we can compute each and add them up.

Wait, but actually, since the problem says "at least two," so

---------------

 we need to compute the probability of 2, 3, or 4 matches. Let me confirm the formula for hypergeometric distribution here.

---------------

 The number of ways to have exactly k matches is C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k). Because she has 4 numbers, so choosing k correct

---------------

 ones and 4 - k incorrect ones from the remaining 6 numbers. Wait, hold on, actually, the total numbers in

---------------

 the set are 10, so the numbers not chosen are 10 - 4 = 6? Wait, no

---------------

. Wait, actually, the 4 numbers she picked are fixed. The lottery randomly selects 4 numbers. The overlap between her numbers and the selected

---------------

 numbers can be 0 to 4. The number of ways to have exactly k matches is C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k). Because

---------------

 she has 4 numbers, so to get k matches, you choose k from her 4 numbers, and the remaining 4 - k numbers must come from the 6 numbers not in her selection. Wait

---------------

, actually, the total numbers not in her selection are 10 - 4 = 6. So yes, that's

---------------

 correct.

Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes for B is the sum over k=2 to 4 of C(4, k)*C(6,4 -k). Then

---------------

 the probability P(B) is that sum divided by C(10,4).

Therefore, putting it all together, the conditional probability P(A|B) is [1 / C(10,4)] divided by [ (sum_{k=2}^4 C(4,k)C(6,4−k)) / C(10,4) ) ] which simplifies to 1 divided by the sum from

---------------

 k=2 to 4 of C(4,k)C(6,4−k).

Wait, let me confirm

---------------

 that. Since both numerator and denominator have divided by C(10,4), they cancel out. So indeed, the

---------------

 conditional probability is 1 divided by [sum_{k=2}^4 C(4,k)C(6,4−k)}

---------------

].

Therefore, the key is to compute that sum.

Let me compute each term:

First, for k=2: C(4,2)*C(6,2).

---------------

 Let me compute each combination:

C(4,2) is 6, and C(6,2) is 15, so 6*15 = 90.

For

---------------

 k=3: C(4,3)*C(6,1). C(4,3)=4, C(6,1)=6, so 4*6=24.

For k=4: C(4,4)*C(6,0)=1*1=1.

Therefore

---------------

, the total sum is 90 +24 +1 = 115.

Therefore, the probability is 1/115?

---------------

 Wait, hold on. Wait, the numerator is 1 (the number of ways for grand prize), and the denominator is

---------------

 the total number of ways to have at least two matches, which is 115. But wait, actually, in

---------------

 terms of combinations, the number of favorable for grand prize is 1, and the number of favorable for B is 115, so the

---------------

 conditional probability is 1/115?

Wait, but hold on, let me check again. Let me make sure I

---------------

 didn't confuse the counts.

Wait, actually, the total number of possible outcomes is C(10,4). The number of ways to

---------------

 get exactly k matches is C(4,k)*C(6,4−k). So the total number of favorable outcomes for B is the

---------------

 sum over k=2,3,4 of those terms. That sum is 90 +24 +1 = 115. So

---------------

 the probability of B is 115 / C(10,4). The probability of A is 1 / C(10,4). Therefore

---------------

, the conditional probability is (1 / C(10,4)) / (115 / C(10,4)) = 1/115. Hmm

---------------

, so that would be m/n =1/115, so m +n=116? But 

---------------

1 and 115 are coprime, yes. Wait, but 115 factors into 5*23, so yes

---------------

, 1 and 115 are coprime. But I feel like maybe I made a mistake here, because 

---------------

115 seems a bit high. Let me double-check the calculations step by step.

First, total number of ways to choose 4 numbers:

---------------

 C(10,4)=210. So that's correct. 10*9*8*7/(4*3*2*1)=210.

Then

---------------

, the number of ways to get exactly 2 matches: C(4,2)*C(6,2). So

---------------

 choosing 2 from her numbers and 2 from the remaining 6. That is 6*15=90, which

---------------

 is correct.

Exactly 3 matches: C(4,3)*C(6,1)=4*6=24.

---------------

 Correct.

Exactly 4 matches: C(4,4)*C(6,0)=1*1=1. Correct.

Total

---------------

 is 90 +24 +1 = 115. So that's correct. So the probability of B is 115/210.

---------------

 The probability of A is 1/210. Therefore, conditional probability is (1/210)/(115/210)=1/115. So

---------------

 1/115 reduces to 1/115, so m + n is 1 + 115=116.

Wait, but that

---------------

 seems a very small probability, but maybe it's correct? Let me think again. The conditional probability is the chance that she got

---------------

 all 4 numbers given that she got at least two. Since getting all 4 is just one case among all the cases where she got two or more. Since there

---------------

 are 115 such cases, and only 1 is the grand prize, so it is 1/115. That

---------------

 seems correct. Hmm. Let me check with an alternative approach.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is interpreted differently? Wait, the

---------------

 problem says "the probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize." So that is, given that she has at least two correct numbers, what's the chance she

---------------

 has all four. So the numerator is the number of grand prize outcomes (1) and the denominator is the number of prize-winning outcomes (1

---------------

15). So yes, that's exactly 1/115. So m + n is 116. Hmm

---------------

. But let me check if there's an error in the hypergeometric calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the

---------------

 number of ways for exactly k matches. Let me confirm:

Suppose Jen picks numbers A, B, C, D. The lottery draws

---------------

 4 numbers. The number of ways that exactly k of her numbers are in the draw is:

For exactly 2 matches: Choose 2 from her 4 numbers, and 2 from the remaining 6 numbers not in her selection. So

---------------

 yes, C(4,2)*C(6,2)=6*15=90.

Similarly for 3 and

---------------

 4. So that seems right. So total is 115. So the answer is 1/115,

---------------

 so m + n = 116. Hmm, maybe that's correct. But let me see if the problem says

---------------

 "the randomly chosen numbers" are selected from S, which is the same as Jen's set. So the problem is indeed

---------------

 about combinations, not permutations, so the calculations should be okay.

Alternatively, maybe I need to compute probabilities instead of counts?

---------------

 Wait, but since both numerator and denominator in the conditional probability are probabilities over the same sample space, so their ratio is the

---------------

 same as the ratio of counts. So the answer should be 1/115. Therefore, 116 is

---------------

 the answer. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is worded differently. Let me check again:

"the probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is

---------------

 m/n"

Yes, so given that she has at least two correct numbers, what is the chance she has all four. Since

---------------

 the only way to have all four is included in the "at least two" cases, so it's 1 divided by the total number of "

---------------

at least two" cases. Since all those cases are equally likely? Wait, but actually, the different cases (2,3,4 matches) have different numbers

---------------

 of combinations, so each outcome is equally likely, but the counts are as we calculated. Therefore, the probability is indeed 1/

---------------

115. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the total number of prize-winning combinations.

---------------

 Let me re-add them: 90 +24 is 114, plus 1 is 115. Correct

---------------

. So that seems right. Therefore, maybe the answer is 116. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is

---------------

 considering something else?

Wait, let me see the problem statement again. Jen picks 4 numbers, then 4 are randomly chosen. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the chosen

---------------

. The grand prize is if all four are chosen. So the conditional probability is P(grand prize)/P(prize). Which

---------------

 is [1/C(10,4)] / [ (sum_{k=2}^4 C(4,k)C(6,4−k))

---------------

 / C(10,4) ) ] = 1 / sum. So 1/115. So

---------------

 yeah, that's it. So 1 + 115 is 116. Hmm. I think that's correct

---------------

.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the hypergeometric terms? Let me check with an example. Let me compute

---------------

 the total number of ways for exactly 2 matches. Suppose her numbers are 1,2,3,4. The number

---------------

 of ways to pick 2 of these and 2 others. So for example, choosing 1,2 and then 5,6. Each

---------------

 of these is a unique combination. The count is indeed C(4,2)*C(6,2). So that seems

---------------

 correct.

Alternatively, let me compute the total number of possible outcomes with at least two matches. Let me compute all possible cases

---------------

:

Total possible prize cases: cases with 2, 3, or 4 matches. So adding those up gives 90 +24 +1 =115. Total

---------------

 possible draws are 210. So 115/210 reduces to 23/42.

---------------

 But the conditional probability is 1/115. Wait, but 1/115 is approximately 0.0087, which seems low

---------------

, but considering that getting all 4 is 1 in 210, and given that you have at least 2, which

---------------

 is 115, so it's like 1/115. Hmmm.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is

---------------

 in the interpretation of "the randomly chosen numbers." Wait, maybe the problem is that the numbers are chosen with order? But the problem says "picking 4 distinct numbers" and "4 numbers are randomly chosen from

---------------

 S," which is a set, so order doesn't matter. So combinations are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the

---------------

 hypergeometric formula? Let me check another way. Let me compute the probability of exactly two matches:

Number of ways:

---------------

 C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6*15=90, so probability is 90/210. Similarly for

---------------

 three: 24/210, four:1/210. So total is (90 +24 +1)/210 =115/210.

Therefore

---------------

, conditional probability is (1/210)/(115/210)=1/115. So

---------------

 yes. So the answer is 1/115, so m + n =1 + 115=116.

Hmm

---------------

. Maybe I was overcomplicating, but I think that's correct. Let me see if another approach gives the same answer

---------------

.

Alternative approach: Imagine all possible 4-number combinations that the lottery could choose. Out of these, the ones that give her a prize are those that have at least two numbers in common with her chosen set. The number

---------------

 of such combinations is 115 as computed. Among these 115, only one combination (her exact set) gives the grand prize. Therefore

---------------

, the probability is 1/115. Therefore, the answer is 116. Yeah, that's

---------------

 consistent. So I think that's the right answer.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{116}


Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, \ldots, 10\} \). The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize needs to be calculated. 

First, we compute the probability of winning the grand prize.

---------------

 This is the probability that all 4 of her numbers are chosen, which is:
\[
P(\text{Grand Prize}) = \frac{1}{\binom{10}{4}}
\]
where \(\binom{10}{4} = 210\).

Next, we calculate the probability of winning a prize, which requires at least 2 of her numbers matching the chosen numbers. We sum

---------------

 the combinations for exactly 2, 3, and 4 matches:
- For exactly 2 matches: \(\binom{4}{2} \binom{6}{2} = 6 \times 15 = 90\)
- For exactly 3 matches: \(\binom{4}{3} \binom{6}{1} = 4 \times 6 = 24\)
- For exactly 4 matches: \(\binom{4}{4} \binom{6}{0} = 1 \times 1 = 1\)

Summing these gives the total number of favorable outcomes for winning a prize:
\[
90 + 24 + 1 = 115
\]
Thus, the probability of winning a prize is:
\[
P(\text{Prize}) = \frac{115}{210}
\]

The conditional probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is:
\[
P(\text{Grand Prize} \mid \text{Prize}) = \frac{P(\text{Grand Prize})}{P(\text{Prize})} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{115}{210}} = \frac{1}{115}
\]

The fraction \(\frac{1}{115}\) is already in simplest form, so \(m = 1\) and \(n = 115\). Therefore, \(m + n = 1 + 115 = 116\).

\[
\boxed{116}
