Okay, so I have this problem about the residents of Aimeville and the different items they own. Let me try to parse it

---------------

 out step by step. 

First, the problem states there are 900 residents. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. So that

---------------

's one item everyone has. Then, there are three other items: diamond rings (195 owners), golf clubs (367), and garden spades (562). 



---------------

Additionally, it mentions that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three of these things. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four items. 



---------------

Hmm. Wait, since everyone owns the candy hearts, the "four things" would be the candy hearts plus one of the other three items

---------------

, right? Or maybe the four things include the candy hearts as one of the four. Let me confirm the problem again.

---------------

 

The problem says: "Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things." The four things must

---------------

 be the four items listed: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. Since everyone owns the candy hearts, the

---------------

 people who own all four would be those who own the candy hearts plus the other three items. But since the candy hearts are owned by everyone, actually

---------------

, the people who own all four are exactly those who own all three of the other items plus the candy hearts. But since

---------------

 the candy hearts are universal, the count of people owning all four is the same as those who own all three of the other items.

---------------

 Wait, but maybe not exactly, because the problem might consider the four items as separate, even though one is universal. Let

---------------

 me think again.

Wait, actually, the problem says "all four of these things," so the four things are the four listed

---------------

: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. Since everyone has the candy hearts, the people who have all four would

---------------

 have to have the other three items as well. Therefore, the number we need is the number of people who own all three of the other

---------------

 items (since they automatically have the candy hearts). However, the problem mentions that 234 residents own exactly three of these things. Wait

---------------

, so "exactly three" could include or exclude the candy hearts? Hmm, that's a key point. 

Hold

---------------

 on, if "exactly three of these things" includes the candy hearts, then the 234 people own exactly three items, which

---------------

 could be any combination, but since everyone has the candy hearts, they must have the candy hearts plus two others, or maybe

---------------

 they don't have the candy hearts? Wait, no, the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So everyone

---------------

 has that. Therefore, when they say someone owns exactly three of these things, they must mean they have the candy hearts plus two others

---------------

. Wait, but that would be three items total. Alternatively, maybe "exactly three" could be three of the other three items (

---------------

excluding the candy hearts), but since everyone has the candy hearts, that's impossible. Because if someone has three of the other

---------------

 items, they would actually have four items in total. 

Ah, this is confusing. Let me parse the problem again carefully

---------------

. 

The problem states: "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So candy hearts are universal

---------------

. Then, the other three items are owned by some subset of the residents. The problem says there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 golf clubs, and 562 garden spades. 



---------------

Then, it says "there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things." 



---------------

Wait, so when they refer to "these things," they must be including the candy hearts as one of the items. Therefore

---------------

, each resident has at least one item (the candy hearts). The other items are optional. So, when they say someone

---------------

 owns exactly two of these things, that means they have the candy hearts plus one other item. Similarly, exactly three would be candy hearts plus two others, and exactly four would be all four items

---------------

. 

Therefore, the total number of residents can be calculated by considering all the different subsets of ownership. 

Let me recall

---------------

 the principle of inclusion-exclusion for four sets. But since one of the sets is universal (candy hearts), which complicates things. Let

---------------

 me see.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this by considering the three non-universal items: diamond rings (D), golf clubs (G), and garden spades (S). Since everyone has the candy hearts (C), so

---------------

 ownership of C is 900. 

The problem mentions "exactly two of these things" and "exactly three of these things."

---------------

 Since everyone has C, "exactly two things" must mean C plus one other, so exactly one of D, G, S. Similarly, "exactly three things" would mean C plus two of D, G, S. And

---------------

 "exactly four things" would be all three of D, G, S plus C. 

Therefore, the problem is

---------------

 really about the three items D, G, S, and we need to find the number of people who have all three,

---------------

 which would correspond to the number of people with all four things (since they also have C). 

Let me note that the

---------------

 total number of residents is 900. Let me denote:

Let’s denote:

- Let a = number of people who own none

---------------

 of D, G, S (but own C). 

- Let b = number of people who own exactly one of D, G, S (so total

---------------

 items owned: 2, since they have C plus one). 

- Let c = number of people who own exactly two of D, G, S (total items owned: 3).

---------------

 

- Let d = number of people who own all three of D, G, S (total items owned: 4). 

Given

---------------

 that everyone owns C, so a + b + c + d = 900.

The problem states that the number of people who own exactly two of these

---------------

 things (i.e., exactly two including C) is 437. Wait, but "exactly two of these things" would mean

---------------

 exactly two items in total, so that would correspond to exactly one of D, G, S (since they already have C). Wait

---------------

, but hold on. Let me confirm:

Wait, the problem says "exactly two of these things". The "these things" must

---------------

 refer to all four items: C, D, G, S. Since everyone has C, the only way to have exactly two of

---------------

 these is to have C plus one of the others. So the count of people with exactly two things is exactly the number of people with exactly one of D, G, S. So

---------------

 that is b = 437. 

Similarly, the number of people with exactly three of these things is 234. That

---------------

 would be people who have C plus exactly two of D, G, S. So that is c = 234. 

Wait

---------------

, but hold on, the problem says "exactly three of these things" would mean three items in total, so C

---------------

 plus two others. So yes, that's c = 234. 

Then, the number of people who own all four things

---------------

 is d, which is what we need to find. 

Now, the total number of residents is a + b + c + d = 900. 



---------------

So, if we can find a, then we can get d. Alternatively, maybe we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion on the three items D, G, S. 

Let

---------------

 me recall that the total number of people who own at least one of D, G, S is equal to (D + G + S) - (number owning

---------------

 two) + (number owning all three). Wait, no, actually, the inclusion-exclusion formula is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

But in

---------------

 our case, the total number of people who own at least one of D, G, S is (a + b + c + d) - a = b + c + d. Since

---------------

 a is the number who own none of D, G, S. 

But since the total residents are 900, then

---------------

 |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 900 - a. 

So, substituting into inclusion-exclusion:

900 - a = |D| + |G| + |S| - (sum of pairwise intersections) + |D ∩ G ∩ S|

We

---------------

 can write that as:

900 - a = (195 + 367 + 562) - (|

---------------

D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S|) + |D ∩ G ∩ S|

Let

---------------

 me compute 195 + 367 + 562 first. 

195 + 367 = 562;

---------------

 562 + 562 = 1124. Wait, 195 + 367 is 562? Let me check:



---------------

195 + 367:

195 + 300 = 495; 495 + 67 = 562. Yes

---------------

. Then 562 + 562 (the third term, 562) would be 1124. Wait

---------------

, no, 195+367+562 is 195+367 is

---------------

 562, plus 562 gives 1124? Wait, no, that's not correct

---------------

. Wait, 195 + 367 is 562, then adding 562 gives

---------------

 562 + 562 = 1124. So total of the three sets is 1124. 

So

---------------

:

900 - a = 1124 - (sum of pairwise intersections) + (D ∩ G ∩ S)

Hmm

---------------

, so we need expressions for the sum of pairwise intersections and the triple intersection. 

But how does this relate to the given numbers

---------------

 of people owning exactly two or exactly three?

Let me think. The number of people who own exactly two of D, G, S is equal to the sum over each pair of (

---------------

number in the intersection of the pair minus three times the triple intersection). Wait, more precisely, the number of people in exactly two of the sets D, G, S is:



---------------

(|D ∩ G| - |D ∩ G ∩ S|) + (|D ∩ S| - |D ∩ G ∩ S|) + (|G ∩ S| - |D ∩ G ∩ S|) )

---------------

 

Which simplifies to (sum of pairwise intersections) - 3*(triple intersection). 

But in our problem, the number of people who own exactly two of the four

---------------

 items (including C) is given as 437. Wait, but as we discussed earlier, that corresponds to exactly one of D, G, S. Wait, no

---------------

, wait: 

Hold on, confusion here. Let me clarify again:

The problem says "exactly two of these things"

---------------

 refers to exactly two items in total. Since everyone has C, that means exactly one of D, G, S. So

---------------

 that's the "exactly one of D, G, S" which is b = 437. 

The

---------------

 number of people who own exactly two of D, G, S (i.e., two of those three plus C, making

---------------

 three items total) is the "exactly three of these things" which is 234. Wait no, actually

---------------

, exactly two of D, G, S would correspond to three items total (C plus two others), which is the "

---------------

exactly three of these things." 

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me rephrase:

Let me define

---------------

 variables for the three items D, G, S (excluding C, since everyone has C). 

Let’s denote:

- The

---------------

 number of people with exactly k of D, G, S is:

- 0: a

- 1: b



---------------

- 2: c

- 3: d

Then, as before, a + b + c + d = 900.

---------------

 

But in the problem:

- The number of people with exactly two of the four items (including C) is 437. Since

---------------

 they have C plus exactly one of D, G, S, that is exactly 1 of D, G, S.

---------------

 Therefore, b = 437.

- The number of people with exactly three of the four items (i.e., C plus exactly two of D, G, S) is 234, so that's

---------------

 the number with exactly two of D, G, S. So c = 234.

- The number with all four items

---------------

 is d, which is exactly three of D, G, S (since they have all three plus C). 

Therefore, in

---------------

 terms of the three items D, G, S:

Total in D: 195 = (number with D only) + (number with D and one other) + (number with D and two others) + (number with all three).

---------------

 

Wait, perhaps it's better to use inclusion-exclusion here. Let me see.

The total number of people who own at least one of D, G, S is (

---------------

b + c + d) = 900 - a.

But also, the total number owning D is 195, G

---------------

 is 367, S is 562. 

So, applying inclusion-exclusion:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|

We

---------------

 can write that as:

(900 - a) = 195 + 367 + 562 - (sum

---------------

 of pairwise intersections) + (triple intersection)

We need to find expressions for the pairwise intersections and the triple intersection.

But

---------------

 let's also note that the number of people who own exactly two of D, G, S is c = 234. 



---------------

The number who own exactly two is equal to the sum over all pairs of (the intersection of the pair minus three times the triple intersection). Wait, more

---------------

 precisely, for each pair, the number of people in exactly that pair is |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ B ∩ C|. 



---------------

Therefore, the total number of people with exactly two items is:

(|D ∩ G| - |D ∩ G ∩ S|) + (|D ∩ S| - |D ∩ G ∩ S|) + (|G ∩ S| - |D ∩ G ∩ S|) )

---------------

 

Which is equal to (|D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S|) - 3|D ∩ G ∩ S| =

---------------

 234.

Similarly, the number who own all three is d = |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

Also

---------------

, the total number owning exactly one item (D, G, or S) is b = 437. 



---------------

The number of people who own exactly one of D, G, S is equal to:

(|D| - (number in D and another

---------------

) + ... ). 

Alternatively, it can be written as:

(|D| + |G| + |S|) - 2*(sum of pairwise intersections) + 3*(triple intersection) =

---------------

 ?

Wait, let me think again. 

The formula for exactly one is:

|D| + |G| + |S| - 2*(sum of pairwise intersections) + 3*(triple intersection).

---------------

 Wait, perhaps not. Let me recall:

The count of exactly one is:

(|D| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|) +

---------------

 (|G| - |D ∩ G| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|) + (|S| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|)



---------------

Simplify each term:

For D only: |D| - (|D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| - |D ∩ G ∩ S|)



---------------

Wait, actually, more systematically:

The number of people in exactly D is |D| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

---------------

 

Similarly for exactly G and exactly S. Adding them up:

Exactly one = [ |D| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S| ] +

---------------

 [ |G| - |D ∩ G| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S| ] + [ |S| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S| ]

Combine terms:

= (|D| + |G| + |S|) - 2(|D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S|) + 3|D ∩ G ∩ S|

Therefore

---------------

:

Exactly one = (Total of individual sets) - 2*(sum of pairwise) + 3*(triple)

---------------

 

We know that exactly one is b = 437. 

So we have:

437 = (195 + 367 + 562) - 2*(sum of pairwise intersections) + 3*d

---------------

 

Because |D ∩ G ∩ S| is d. 

We can compute the first term:

195 + 367 + 562 = 195+367=562; 562+562=1124. Wait

---------------

, no, 195 + 367 is 562? Wait 195 + 367:

---------------

 200 + 367 = 567, minus 5 = 562. Then

---------------

 562 + 562 = 1124. So yes, total is 1124.

So

---------------

:

437 = 1124 - 2*(sum of pairwise) + 3d

Similarly, we

---------------

 had earlier from the inclusion-exclusion:

900 - a = 1124 - (sum of pairwise) + d 

Also

---------------

, the equation from exactly two:

sum of pairwise intersections - 3d = 234

Wait, earlier,

---------------

 we had:

The number of exactly two is (sum pairwise) - 3d = 234. 

So

---------------

, sum pairwise = 234 + 3d 

Now, let me note down all equations:

1. a

---------------

 + b + c + d = 900

We know b = 437, c = 234,

---------------

 so:

a + 437 + 234 + d = 900 ⇒ a + d = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229.

---------------

 

So equation 1: a + d = 229

2. From exactly two: sum pairwise = 234 + 3d 



---------------

3. From exactly one: 437 = 1124 - 2*(sum pairwise) + 3d 

4

---------------

. From inclusion-exclusion: 900 - a = 1124 - sum pairwise + d 

Let

---------------

 me substitute equation 2 into equation 3. 

Equation 3: 437 = 1124 - 2*(234 + 3d) + 3d 

Compute

---------------

:

437 = 1124 - 468 -6d + 3d 

Simplify:



---------------

437 = (1124 - 468) + (-6d + 3d) 

1124 - 468 =

---------------

 656 

So 437 = 656 - 3d 

Then, subtract 656 from

---------------

 both sides:

437 - 656 = -3d 

-219 = -3d ⇒ d = 73 

Hmm

---------------

, so d is 73. Let me check if this is consistent. 

If d = 73, then sum pairwise = 234 + 3*73 = 234 + 219 = 453 

Now

---------------

 check equation 4:

900 - a = 1124 - sum pairwise + d 

Plugging in the

---------------

 numbers:

900 - a = 1124 - 453 + 73 

Calculate 

---------------

1124 - 453 = 671, then +73 = 744. 

So

---------------

 900 - a = 744 ⇒ a = 900 - 744 = 156 

Then

---------------

 from equation 1, a + d = 156 + 73 = 229, which matches,

---------------

 so that's consistent. 

Therefore, the number of people who own all four items is d = 73. 

Wait, but let me confirm

---------------

 with another equation. Let's check equation 4 again. 

We had:

sum pairwise = 453 

Then

---------------

, the inclusion-exclusion:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = 1124 - 453 + 73 = 1124 - 453 is 671, plus 73 is 744. 



---------------

And 900 - a = 900 - 156 = 744. So that's

---------------

 correct. 

Therefore, the calculations seem consistent. 

Therefore, the answer is 73. 

But let me just

---------------

 recap to ensure I didn't make any miscalculations. 

So, steps:

- Recognize that everyone has the

---------------

 candy hearts, so the four items are C, D, G, S. 

- The problem's counts for exactly two and three items

---------------

 refer to total items, so exactly two includes C plus one other, so exactly one of D, G, S. 

- Set

---------------

 up variables a (0 of DGS), b (1), c (2), d (3). 

- Equations based

---------------

 on inclusion-exclusion and given counts. 

- Solved the equations step by step, ended up with d = 73. 

Thus

---------------

, the number of residents who own all four items is 73. 

**Final Answer**
\boxed{73}


Given the problem of finding the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four items (diamond ring, set of golf clubs, garden spade, and bag of candy hearts), we start by noting that every resident owns the candy hearts. Therefore, we focus on the ownership

---------------

 of the other three items: diamond rings (D), golf clubs (G), and garden spades (S).

Key steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - \( a \): Number of residents who own none of D, G, S.
   - \( b \): Number of residents who own exactly one of D, G, S (total

---------------

 items: 2 including candy hearts).
   - \( c \): Number of residents who own exactly two of D, G, S (total items: 3 including candy hearts).
   - \( d \): Number of residents who own all three of D, G, S (total items: 4 including candy hearts).

2. **Given Data

---------------

:**
   - Total residents: 900.
   - Residents owning exactly two items (i.e., exactly one of D, G, S): \( b = 437 \).
   - Residents owning exactly three items (i.e., exactly two of D, G, S): \( c = 234 \).

3. **Equations:**
   - Total residents: \( a + b + c + d = 900 \).
   - Sub

---------------

stituting known values: \( a + 437 + 234 + d = 900 \) leading

---------------

 to \( a + d = 229 \).

4. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:**
   - Total owning

---------------

 at least one of D, G, S: \( 900 - a \).
   - Applying inclusion-exclusion for

---------------

 sets D, G, S:
     \[
     900 - a = |D| + |G| + |S| - (|D \cap G| + |D \cap S| + |G \cap S|) + |D \cap G \cap S|
     \]
   - Given

---------------

 \( |D| = 195 \), \( |G| = 367 \), \( |S| = 562 \), the

---------------

 total is \( 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124 \).

5. **Equ

---------------

ations for Pairwise and Triple Intersections:**
   - Number of residents owning exactly two of D, G, S:

---------------

 \( (|D \cap G| + |D \cap S| + |G \cap S|) - 3|D \cap G \cap S| = 234 \).
   - Let \( \text{sum pairwise} = |D \cap G| + |D \cap S| + |G \cap S| \). Then,

---------------

 \( \text{sum pairwise} - 3d = 234 \).
   - Number of residents owning exactly one of D, G, S: 
     \[
     437 = 1124 - 2 \times \text{sum pairwise} + 3d
     \]

6. **Solving Equations:**
   - Substitute \( \text{sum pairwise} = 234 + 3d \) into the equation for exactly one:
     \[
     437 = 1124 - 2(234 + 3d) + 3d
     \]
     Simplifying gives

---------------

 \( d = 73 \).

7. **Verification:**
   - Check consistency with inclusion-exclusion and total residents,

---------------

 confirming \( d = 73 \) is correct.

Thus, the number of residents who own all four items is \(\boxed{73}\).<|im_end|>
