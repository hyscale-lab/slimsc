Okay, so I need to find the greatest four-digit number N such that if any single digit is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, once

---------------

 I find N, I have to compute Q + R where N divided by 1000 gives quotient Q and remainder R. Hmm

---------------

, let's break this down step by step.

First, let's understand the problem. The number N is a four-digit number, so

---------------

 it's between 1000 and 9999. The key property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number must be divisible by 7. So

---------------

, for each digit in N (thousands, hundreds, tens, units), replacing it with 1 should make the number divisible by 7. Our

---------------

 goal is to find the largest such N and then compute Q + R when N is divided by 1000.



---------------

Let me denote the four digits of N as a, b, c, d, so N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. Then

---------------

, changing each digit to 1 gives four different numbers:

1. Change a to 1: 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d
2. Change b to 1: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d
3. Change c to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d
4. Change d to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1

Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7. So

---------------

, each of these four modified numbers ≡ 0 mod 7.

Therefore, we can set up four congruence equations:



---------------

1. 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Our

---------------

 unknowns are a, b, c, d (each digits from 0-9, with a ≠ 0). We

---------------

 need to find the maximum N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d satisfying

---------------

 these four conditions.

Hmm, this seems a bit involved. Maybe I can express each of these congruences in terms of the original number N and

---------------

 see if I can find relationships between them?

Let me denote N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

Then

---------------

, changing the first digit (a) to 1 gives:

1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = N

---------------

 - 1000(a - 1)

Similarly, changing the second digit (b) to 1 gives:

1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = N - 100(b - 1)

Third digit (c):

1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = N - 10(c - 1)

Fourth digit (d):

1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 = N - (d - 1)

Therefore

---------------

, each of these expressions must be divisible by 7. So, for each of these modified numbers, their difference from N must be

---------------

 congruent to -N mod 7. Wait, maybe I can rephrase each condition as:

(N - 1000(a - 1)) ≡ 0 mod7



---------------

But N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, so substituting:



---------------

1000a + 100b + 10c + d - 1000a + 1000 ≡ 0 mod7

S

---------------

implify: 100b + 10c + d + 1000 ≡ 0 mod7

Similarly for the other

---------------

 conditions:

Changing b to 1:

(N - 100(b - 1)) ≡0 mod7



---------------

Substitute N:

1000a + 100b + 10c + d - 100b + 100 ≡0 mod7

Simplify: 1000a + 10c + d + 100 ≡0 mod7

Changing

---------------

 c to 1:

(N -10(c -1)) ≡0 mod7

1000a + 100b +10c +d -10c +10 ≡0 mod7

Simplify: 1000a +100b +d +10 ≡0 mod7

Changing d to 1:

(N - (d -1)) ≡0 mod7

1000a +100b +10c +d -d +1 ≡0 mod7

Simplify: 1000a +100b +10c +1 ≡0 mod7

Hmm

---------------

, okay so the four congruence equations are:

1. 100b + 10c + d + 1000 ≡0 mod7 -->

---------------

 Let's call this Equation (1)

2. 1000a +10c + d + 100 ≡0 mod7 --> Equation (2)

3. 1000a +100b +d +10 ≡0 mod7 --> Equation (3)

4. 1000a +100b +10c +1 ≡0 mod7 --> Equation (4)

Now

---------------

, perhaps I can express each equation modulo 7, since we're dealing with mod7.

First, let me compute the

---------------

 values of 1000 mod7, 100 mod7, 10 mod7, etc.

---------------

 That might help.

Calculating modulus 7 for these coefficients:

Compute 10 mod7 = 3

100 mod7: 100

---------------

 divided by 7 is 14*7=98, so 100 -98=2.

---------------

 So 100 ≡2 mod7.

Similarly, 1000 mod7: 1000 divided by 7:

---------------

 7*142=994, so 1000-994=6. So

---------------

 1000≡6 mod7.

Therefore:

1000 mod7=6,

100 mod7=2,

10 mod7=3,

1 mod7=1.

So

---------------

 substituting these into the equations:

Equation (1):

100b + 10c + d + 1000 ≡ (2b + 3c + d) + 6 ≡0 mod7



---------------

Wait, let me redo each equation step by step.

Equation (1): 100b + 10c + d + 1000 mod

---------------

7.

Each term:

100b mod7 = 2b,

10c mod7 = 3c,

d mod7 = d,

1000 mod7 =6,

Therefore

---------------

 total mod7: 2b + 3c + d +6 ≡0 mod7. Equation (1):

---------------

 2b +3c +d ≡ -6 mod7. Since mod7, -6 is equivalent to 1 mod

---------------

7. So Equation (1): 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

Equation (2): 1000a +10c + d + 100 mod7.

Breaking

---------------

 down:

1000a mod7 =6a,

10c mod7=3c,

d mod7=d,

100 mod7=2,

Thus

---------------

 total: 6a +3c +d +2 ≡0 mod7.

Hence Equation (2):6a +3c +d ≡-2 mod7.

---------------

 But -2 mod7 is 5, so 6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7.

Equation (3):1000a +100b +d +10 mod7.

Breaking

---------------

 down:

1000a mod7=6a,

100b mod7=2b,

d mod7=d,

10 mod7=3,

Thus

---------------

 total:6a +2b +d +3 ≡0 mod7.

So Equation (3):6a +2b +d ≡-3 mod7. -

---------------

3 mod7 is 4, so 6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7.

Equation (4):1000a +100b +10c +1 mod7.

Breaking down:

1000a mod7=6a,

100b mod7=2b,

10c mod7=3c,

1 mod7=1,

Thus

---------------

 total:6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

So Equation (4):6a +2b +3c ≡-1 mod7. -1 mod7 is 6, so 6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

So

---------------

 now we have four equations:

1. 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7. (Equation 1)

2. 6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7. (Equation 2)

3. 6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7. (Equation 3)

4. 6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7. (Equation 4)

Hmm

---------------

, okay. Now we have four equations with variables a,b,c,d. Since a,b,c,d are digits (a from 1-9, others 0-9), we

---------------

 need to find their values that satisfy these equations. Our goal is the largest N, so we need to maximize N = 1000a + 

---------------

100b +10c +d, so we should start with the highest possible a, then b, etc., and

---------------

 check if the equations are satisfied.

Alternatively, maybe we can solve the system of equations step by step. Let me see.

First, let

---------------

's see if we can express variables in terms of others.

Let me note the equations again:

Equation1: 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

---------------

 (1)

Equation2:6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7. (2)

Equation3:6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7. (3)

Equation4:6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7. (4)

Hmm

---------------

, perhaps subtract equations to eliminate variables.

First, let's see Equations 2 and 3. Let's subtract equation

---------------

 3 from equation 2:

(6a +3c +d) - (6a +2b +d) ≡ (5 -4) mod7

So

---------------

: (3c -2b) ≡1 mod7 --> 3c -2b ≡1 mod7. Let's call this Equation 

---------------

5.

Similarly, let's subtract Equation1 from Equation4:

Equation4 - Equation1:

(6a +2b +3c) - (2b +3c +d) ≡6 -1 mod7

So

---------------

:6a -d ≡5 mod7 --> 6a -d ≡5 mod7. Let's call this Equation6.

Also

---------------

, Equation2 and Equation3 can be considered. Maybe we can find relations between variables.

Alternatively, let's see Equation1

---------------

 and Equation2. Let me see if we can express d from Equation1 and plug into Equation2.

From Equation1: d ≡1 -2b -3c mod7.

Pl

---------------

ugging into Equation2:

6a +3c + (1 -2b -3c) ≡5 mod7

Simplify:6a -2b +1 ≡5 mod7 -->6a -2b ≡4 mod7 --> divide

---------------

 both sides by 2: 3a -b ≡2 mod7. Let's call this Equation7.

Similarly, from

---------------

 Equation3: let's express d from Equation3.

Equation3: d ≡4 -6a -2b mod7.

Pl

---------------

ugging into Equation1:

2b +3c + (4 -6a -2b) ≡1 mod7

Simplify: 

---------------

3c +4 -6a ≡1 mod7 --> -6a +3c ≡-3 mod7 --> 

---------------

6a -3c ≡3 mod7 --> divide by 3: 2a -c ≡1 mod7. Let's call this Equation8.

So

---------------

 now we have:

Equation5: 3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

Equation6:6a -d ≡5 mod7.

Equation7:3a -b ≡2 mod7.

Equation8:2a -c ≡1 mod7.

Hmm

---------------

, perhaps we can use Equations 7 and 8 to express b and c in terms of a.

From Equation7: 3a -b ≡2 mod7 -->

---------------

 b ≡3a -2 mod7.

From Equation8:2a -c ≡1 mod7 --> c ≡2a -1 mod7.

So

---------------

, let's write b and c in terms of a modulo7.

Let me denote:

Let’s denote variables:

Let’s let

---------------

’s set b = 3a -2 +7k, for some integer k,

and c =2a -1 +7m, for some integer m.

But since b and c are digits (0-9),

---------------

 their values are constrained. So we need to find a (from 1-9) such that when we compute b and c as

---------------

 above, they are within 0-9. Also, a is a digit from 1-9.

Similarly, once

---------------

 we have b and c in terms of a, we can plug into Equation5 to get a relation between a and the constants

---------------

?

Alternatively, let's see:

From Equation5: 3c -2b ≡1 mod7. Substitute expressions

---------------

 for b and c from Equations7 and8.

Since c =2a -1 +7m,

and b =3a -2 +7k,

then

---------------

 plug into 3c -2b:

3*(2a -1 +7m) -2*(3a -2 +7k) =

---------------

 6a -3 +21m -6a +4 -14k = (6a -6a) + (-3 +4) + (21m -14k) = 1 +7*(3m -2k).



---------------

Thus 3c -2b ≡1 mod7, which matches Equation5. So that checks out. So Equ

---------------

ations5 is automatically satisfied given Equations7 and8. Therefore, Equations5 is redundant once Equations7 and8 are satisfied.

Similarly

---------------

, perhaps Equations6 and others can be connected.

So, moving forward, let's express variables in terms of a:



---------------

Given Equation7: b =3a -2 mod7,

Equation8: c=2a -1 mod7,

and

---------------

 from Equation6: d ≡6a -5 mod7.

Wait, Equation6:6a -d ≡5 mod7 -->

---------------

 d ≡6a -5 mod7.

So d is congruent to (6a -5) mod7.

So

---------------

 all variables b, c, d can be expressed in terms of a modulo7. However, since a, b, c, d are digits,

---------------

 their actual values are constrained between 0-9 (with a ≥1). So we need to find a value of a (from 1-9) such that when we compute b, c, d based

---------------

 on these congruences, they are valid digits (0-9 for b,c,d; 1-9 for a).

---------------

 Also, we need to ensure that the equations hold exactly mod7, not just congruence.

Wait, actually, the

---------------

 equations are modulo7, so the expressions for b, c, d are congruent to those values mod7. But their

---------------

 actual values must satisfy the original equations. Therefore, perhaps we need to consider the equations as equalities in integers, but with

---------------

 the mod7 constraints. Hmm, this might be a bit tricky. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps we can proceed step

---------------

 by step.

First, let's note that a is a digit from 1 to 9, so let's iterate a

---------------

 from 9 downwards (since we want the largest N, so starting with a=9, then 8 etc.) and see

---------------

 if possible.

For each a from 9 down to 1:

1. Compute possible b and c from Equations7 and8 mod

---------------

7.

But since b and c have to be digits (0-9), we can find possible values of b and c that

---------------

 satisfy:

b ≡3a -2 mod7,

c ≡2a -1 mod7,

and then also

---------------

, with these b and c, compute d from Equation1 or Equation2, etc., ensuring that d is a digit (0-9)

---------------

 and that the equations hold.

Alternatively, let's formalize this:

Given a, we can compute b mod7 as (3a -2) mod7,

and

---------------

 c mod7 as (2a -1) mod7,

then d mod7 is (6a -5) mod7.



---------------

But since b, c, d are digits, their actual values can be written as:

b = 3a -2 +7k,



---------------

c =2a -1 +7m,

d=6a -5 +7n,

where k, m, n are integers such

---------------

 that b, c, d are in their respective ranges (0-9 for b,c,d, and a from1-9).

Our

---------------

 task is to find a (starting from 9 down), and find integers k, m, n such that b, c, d are digits

---------------

, and then check whether the original equations are satisfied (since the congruences are necessary but not sufficient? Wait, actually

---------------

, the equations were derived from the original problem's conditions, so if the congruences are satisfied, then the original conditions

---------------

 should hold? Maybe not exactly, since we have to ensure that when we set the digits, the numbers are actually divisible by7,

---------------

 but since we are working mod7, perhaps as long as the congruences are satisfied, the divisibility holds. Hmm

---------------

, maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps the equations we derived are necessary and sufficient, so if the congruences are satisfied, then the original

---------------

 conditions hold. Let me confirm:

We started with the original conditions (each modified number divisible by7), then derived the four equations mod

---------------

7. Therefore, if the four equations hold mod7, then the original conditions are satisfied. Because the equations were derived from

---------------

 those conditions. So, as long as the four equations are satisfied, the problem's conditions are met. Therefore, as long as we

---------------

 can find digits a,b,c,d (with a from1-9) that satisfy all four equations mod7, then that

---------------

 number N will satisfy the problem's requirement. Therefore, we just need to find such a number, the largest possible.

Therefore, proceeding

---------------

 with this approach.

So, let's try a from 9 down to 1, and for each a, compute possible b, c, d as

---------------

 per the congruences, then check if they can be digits (0-9), and then verify if the equations are satisfied

---------------

 (though maybe the congruences are sufficient).

Wait, but actually, when we set up the equations mod7, they

---------------

 are necessary and sufficient, so if we can find a, b, c, d with the congruences, then it

---------------

 works. So maybe even if we just find the values mod7, but then adjust with the 7k, 7m, 

---------------

7n terms to get actual digits, then it should work.

But let's see.

Let me start with a=9.



---------------

Case a=9:

Compute b ≡3a -2 mod7. 3*9=27, 27-2=25. 25 mod7: 25-

---------------

3*7=25-21=4, so b ≡4 mod7.

Similarly c ≡2a -1 mod7: 2*9 -

---------------

1=17, 17 mod7: 17-2*7=3, so c≡3 mod7.

d≡6a -5 mod7: 6*9=54,

---------------

 54-5=49. 49 mod7=0. So d≡0 mod7.

So

---------------

:

b ≡4 mod7,

c≡3 mod7,

d≡0 mod7.

Now, since a=9,

---------------

 which is fixed, we need to find b, c, d digits (0-9) such that:

b ≡4 mod7:

---------------

 possible b=4,11 (but 11 is too big, so only b=4 or 4+7=11 invalid

---------------

. So only b=4.

Wait, but 4 mod7 is 4, so possible b=4, 

---------------

11, 18... but since b is a digit (0-9), only possible b=4.

Similarly,

---------------

 c≡3 mod7: c can be 3 or 10 (but 10 is invalid), so c=3.

d≡0 mod7: possible d=0,7.



---------------

So, possible candidates for a=9:

b=4, c=3, d=0 or 7.

Now

---------------

, we need to check if these satisfy the original equations.

Wait, actually, since we derived the congruences from the original equations, as

---------------

 long as these congruences are satisfied, then the equations mod7 hold, which is necessary. However, the actual equations

---------------

 may require more precise conditions. Wait, but since the equations were set up as mod7, the congruences are exactly

---------------

 what's needed. Therefore, if the congruences are satisfied, the original four modified numbers are divisible by7. Therefore

---------------

, the candidates with these b,c,d should work.

Therefore, for a=9, possible N are:

First candidate: b

---------------

=4, c=3, d=0: N=9430.

Second candidate: b=4, c=3, d=7: N=9437.

But

---------------

 we need to check if these actually satisfy the original conditions. Let me verify with N=9430.

Check the

---------------

 four cases:

1. Change a to1: 1430. Is 1430 divisible by7?

1

---------------

430 ÷7: 7*200=1400, 1430-1400=30. 30 �

---------------

�7 is ~4.28. Not divisible. Wait, that's a problem. Hmm, but according to our congr

---------------

uence setup, this should be divisible. So something went wrong here.

Wait, so maybe my assumption that congruence satisfaction

---------------

 is sufficient is incorrect? Let me see where the mistake is.

Wait, let me recalculate. Let me check N=9430.



---------------

First, changing a to 1 gives 1430.

1430 divided by7: 7*204=1428, 1430-1428=2. So remainder 2, not

---------------

 divisible by7. Hmm, that's a problem.

Hmm, so my reasoning must have an error. Let me check my

---------------

 equations again.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in setting up the equations. Let me retrace the steps.

Original equations

---------------

:

Equation1: 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7. For N=9430,

---------------

 which has b=4, c=3, d=0.

Plugging in: 2*4 + 3*3 +0 =8+9=17.

---------------

 17 mod7 is 3. Which is supposed to be ≡1 mod7? 17 mod7=3.

---------------

 So that's not 1 mod7. Wait, so this contradicts. That means my calculation was wrong?

Wait, but

---------------

 earlier when a=9, we had b≡4 mod7, c≡3 mod7, d≡0 mod7.

---------------

 But when we plug into Equation1, it's not satisfying. Hmm, so maybe my equations were set up incorrectly?

Wait, let me rec

---------------

ast the problem again.

Wait, let me re-express the equations. Let me go back to the first equations.

Original

---------------

 four equations after substitutions were:

Equation1: 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

With

---------------

 a=9, b=4, c=3, d=0:

2*4 +3*3 +0 = 8 +9 +

---------------

0 =17 mod7 is 3. 3≡1 mod7? No. So that's a problem. Therefore

---------------

, my mistake must have been in the setup of equations.

Hmm, let me check my initial equations again.

The first equation

---------------

 was from changing the first digit (a) to 1:

The modified number is 1000*1 + 100b +10c +d.

---------------

 The original number N is 1000a + 100b +10c +d. Therefore

---------------

, the difference is 1000*(1 -a) + (0) + (0) +0 =

---------------

 1000(1 -a). Therefore, the modified number is N -1000(a -1). Therefore

---------------

, N -1000(a -1) ≡0 mod7.

Thus, N ≡1000(a -1) mod7.

But

---------------

 N =1000a +100b +10c +d. So,

1000a +100b +10c +d ≡1000(a -1) mod7,



---------------

which simplifies to:

100b +10c +d +1000 ≡0 mod7,



---------------

since 1000a -1000(a -1) =1000.

Wait, yes

---------------

, so 100b +10c +d +1000 ≡0 mod7,

so

---------------

 100b mod7 is 2b,

10c mod7 is 3c,

d mod7 is d,

1000 mod7 is 6,

so

---------------

 total: 2b +3c +d +6 ≡0 mod7,

so 2b +3c +d ≡ -

---------------

6 mod7. But -6 mod7 is 1. So that's correct. So equation1 is correct.

But

---------------

 in the case of a=9, b=4, c=3, d=0,

2b +3c +d = 

---------------

8 +9 +0 =17 ≡3 mod7. But equation requires 1 mod7. So discrepancy here. So

---------------

 that means even though we followed the congruence for b,c,d, they don't satisfy the equation. Therefore, my

---------------

 mistake must be in how I derived the expressions for b,c,d in terms of a.

Wait, let's see:

Earlier

---------------

, I had:

From Equation7: b ≡3a -2 mod7,

Equation8: c ≡2a -1 mod7,

Equ

---------------

ation6: d ≡6a -5 mod7.

Wait, but these were derived from Equations 1,

---------------

2,3,4. Let me check the derivation again.

Equation7 was from Equation2 - Equation3:

Wait

---------------

, let me rederive Equation7 and Equation8 again.

Equation2:6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7,

Equation3:6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7,

Subtracting

---------------

 Equation3 from Equation2:

(6a +3c +d) - (6a +2b +d) ≡5 -4 mod7,

So

---------------

 3c -2b ≡1 mod7 --> Equation5.

Then, from Equation1 and Equation2:

Equation1:2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7,

Equation2:6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7,

Subtract Equation1 from Equation2:

(6a +3c +d) - (2b +3c +d) ≡5 -1 mod7,

6

---------------

a -2b ≡4 mod7,

Divide by 2: 3a -b ≡2 mod7 --> Equation7:

---------------

 b ≡3a -2 mod7. That is correct.

Similarly, from Equation1 and Equation3:

Equation1:2b +3c +d ≡1,

Equation3:6a +2b +d ≡4,

Subtract Equation1 from Equation3:

(6a +2b +d) - (2b +3c +d) ≡4 -1 mod7,

6a -3c ≡3 mod7,

Divide by 3: 2a -c ≡1 mod7 --> Equation8: c ≡2a -1 mod7. Correct.

Equ

---------------

ation6 was from Equation4 - Equation1:

Equation4:6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7,

Equation1:2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7,

Subtract Equation1 from Equation4:

(6a +2b +3c) - (2b +3c +d) ≡6 -1 mod7,

6a -d ≡5 mod7 --> Equation6: d ≡6a -5 mod7. Correct.

Therefore

---------------

, these equations are correct.

So for a=9,

Equation7: b ≡3*9 -2 mod7,



---------------

27-2=25, 25 mod7= 25-3*7=25-21=4 mod

---------------

7. So b≡4 mod7. So b can be 4 or 11, but since b is a digit, 4.



---------------

Equation8: c≡2*9 -1 mod7,

18-1=17 mod7=1

---------------

7-14=3 mod7. So c≡3 mod7. So c=3 or 10 (

---------------

invalid), so 3.

Equation6: d≡6*9 -5 mod7,

54-5=49 mod7=0 mod7. So d≡0 mod7.

---------------

 So d=0 or7.

Therefore, the values are b=4, c=3, d=0 or7. But

---------------

 when plugging into equation1, we saw that for d=0, equation1 gives 2b+3c +d =1

---------------

7 ≡3 mod7, which is not 1 mod7. So that contradicts. Therefore, my mistake must be in

---------------

 assuming that the equations are sufficient?

Wait, but equation1 requires 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

---------------

 However, with the values from the equations, we have:

From equation1's perspective, if b=4, c=3, d=0:



---------------

2b+3c +d= 8+9+0=17≡3 mod7, which is not 1 mod

---------------

7. So that doesn't satisfy equation1. Therefore, my mistake must be in the process.

Wait, perhaps I missed

---------------

 that the equations are connected, so even if each congruence is satisfied individually, they must be satisfied together. So perhaps

---------------

 when I set b≡3a-2 mod7 and c≡2a-1 mod7 and d≡6a-5 mod7, these

---------------

 must all hold simultaneously, but perhaps they also have to satisfy Equation1?

Wait, Equation1 is part of the original set

---------------

, so if equations 2,3,4 are used to derive equations7,8,6, then perhaps equation1 is redundant

---------------

 or must be satisfied through the combination?

Wait, let me see:

If we have equations 7,8,6,

---------------

 do they ensure equation1?

Let me see:

From equation7: b=3a-2 +7k,

equation8: c=2a-1 +7m,

equation6: d=6a-5 +7n,

then

---------------

 plug into equation1: 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7?

Let me compute 2b +3c +d:



---------------

2*(3a -2 +7k) +3*(2a -1 +7m) + (6a -5 +7n)

=6

---------------

a -4 +14k +6a -3 +21m +6a -5 +7n

Combine

---------------

 like terms:

(6a +6a +6a) + (-4 -3 -5) + (14k +21m +7n)

=18a -12 +7*(2k +3m +n)

Therefore

---------------

 mod7:

18a mod7: 18 mod7=4, so 4a mod7,

-12 mod7: -12 +14=2 mod7,

Thus

---------------

 total:4a +2 mod7.

We need this ≡1 mod7:

4a +2 ≡1 mod7 -->

---------------

 4a ≡-1 mod7 --> 4a≡6 mod7 --> Multiply both sides by inverse of 4 mod7.

---------------

 Since 4*2=8≡1 mod7, inverse is 2.

Thus, a≡6*2=12≡5 mod7.

Therefore

---------------

, equation1 is satisfied only if a≡5 mod7.

Therefore, even with equations7,8,6, equation1 requires

---------------

 a ≡5 mod7.

Ah! So that is the missing piece. Therefore, in addition to the congruences for

---------------

 b,c,d in terms of a, we must also have a ≡5 mod7 for equation1 to hold.

Therefore, when

---------------

 choosing a, it must satisfy a ≡5 mod7. Therefore, a can be 5, 12,

---------------

 19,... but since a is a digit from1-9, possible a=5 or 12- but

---------------

 12 is too big. So only a=5.

Wait, but 5 mod7 is 5, so only

---------------

 a=5.

Wait, but earlier when I tried a=9, which is 2 mod7 (9 mod7=2), so

---------------

 that's not ≡5 mod7, hence equation1 wasn't satisfied. So my mistake was not considering that a must also

---------------

 satisfy a≡5 mod7.

Therefore, the key constraint is a ≡5 mod7, so a can be 5 or 12,

---------------

 but since a is a digit, only a=5 is possible. Wait, but 5 mod7 is 5, but

---------------

 5 is within 1-9. However, since we are to find the maximum N, which would prefer a as

---------------

 large as possible. But if a must be ≡5 mod7, then the possible a's are 5,12,

---------------

19,… but within 1-9, only 5. So the maximum a possible is 5? That can

---------------

't be right, since maybe there are higher a's if we consider the equations differently?

Wait, hold on. Let me re

---------------

trace.

The requirement from equation1 is that 4a +2 ≡1 mod7 -->4a≡-1 mod7 -->

---------------

 4a≡6 mod7. So solving for a:

4a ≡6 mod7

Multiply both sides by inverse

---------------

 of 4 mod7, which is 2 (since 4×2=8≡1 mod7):

a≡6×2=

---------------

12≡5 mod7. So yes, a must be ≡5 mod7.

Thus, a can be 5,12,19,…

---------------

 but since a is a digit from1-9, only a=5 is valid. Therefore, the only possible a is 5?

---------------

 That would mean the maximum N is with a=5? But that seems too low. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I made an error in the derivation.

Let me re-derive the condition for equation1.

We had:

After substituting equations

---------------

7,8,6 into equation1, we found that equation1 requires 4a +2 ≡1 mod7,

---------------

 leading to 4a ≡-1 mod7, which is 4a≡6 mod7, so a≡6

---------------

*(4^{-1}) mod7.

Since 4^{-1}=2 mod7, so a≡6×2=12≡5 mod7. So

---------------

 yes, a must be ≡5 mod7.

Therefore, only a=5 is possible as a digit. So that

---------------

 would mean the maximum N is with a=5. But that can't be correct, because the problem states "the greatest four-digit number", so maybe

---------------

 there's a mistake here?

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution steps.

Wait let me recompute the substitution for

---------------

 equation1 with variables expressed in terms of a:

We had:

2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7,

but

---------------

 substituting b=3a-2 +7k,

c=2a -1 +7m,

d=6a -5 +7n,

then 

---------------

2*(3a-2) +3*(2a-1) + (6a -5) +7*(2k +3m +n) �

---------------

�1 mod7,

So:

6a -4 +6a -3 +6a -5 + ... the 

---------------

7*(...) part is 0 mod7,

So total for non-7 terms: 6a+6a+6a =18a,

-4-3-5 =-12,

So

---------------

 total 18a -12 ≡1 mod7,

18a mod7 is (18 mod7)=

---------------

4, so 4a,

-12 mod7 is (-12 +14)=2,

Thus 4a +2 ≡1 mod7,

so

---------------

 4a ≡-1 mod7,

Yes, same as before.

Therefore, the conclusion holds: a must ≡5 mod7,

---------------

 so only a=5 is possible. But that would mean the maximum N is 5xxx, but the problem says "greatest four-digit number", so maybe

---------------

 I missed something?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the equations? Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps the

---------------

 error is in the direction of the equations. Let me try plugging in a=5.

Case a=5:

Check

---------------

 if a=5 satisfies a≡5 mod7? Yes, 5 mod7 is 5. So proceed.

Compute

---------------

 b,c,d:

From Equation7: b≡3a-2 mod7=15-2=13 mod7=6 mod7.

---------------

 So b≡6 mod7.

Possible b=6 or 13 (invalid), so b=6.

Equation8: c≡2a-1 mod7=10-1=9 mod7=2 mod7. So c≡2 mod7. So

---------------

 c=2 or 9 (since 2+7=9).

Equation6: d≡6a-5 mod7=30-5=25 mod7=4 mod7. So

---------------

 d≡4 mod7. d=4 or 11 (invalid), so d=4.

Therefore, possible candidates

---------------

 for a=5:

b=6, c=2 or9, d=4.

Thus possible N values:

First

---------------

 candidate: b=6, c=2, d=4: N=5624.

Second candidate: b=6, c=9, d=4: N=5694.

Now

---------------

 check these candidates.

First, check N=5624.

Check the four conditions:

1. Change a to1: 1624. Check

---------------

 divisibility by7.

1624 ÷7: 7*232=1624. Exactly divisible. Good.

2. Change b to1: 5124. 5124 ÷7:

---------------

 7*732=5124. Exactly divisible. Good.

3. Change c to1: 5614. 5614 ÷7: 7*802=5614. 

---------------

7*800=5600, 7*2=14, total 5614. Yes

---------------

, divisible.

4. Change d to1:5621. 5621 ÷7. Let's see:

---------------

 7*800=5600, 5621-5600=21. 21 �

---------------

�7=3. So total 803. 7*803=5621. Yes

---------------

, divisible. So N=5624 works.

Now the second candidate N=5694.

Check:



---------------

1. Change a to1:1694. 1694 ÷7. 7*242=1694.

---------------

 7*240=1680, 14 more: 242. So divisible.

2. Change b to1:5194. 5194 ÷7: 7*742=5194?

---------------

 7*700=4900, 7*42=294. 4900+294=5194. Yes,

---------------

 divisible.

3. Change c to1:5614 (same as first case). Wait, 5694 changing c (the

---------------

 third digit, which is 9) to1 gives 56 1 4? Wait, N is 5 (

---------------

a),6 (b),9 (c),4 (d). Changing c (the third digit) to1: so

---------------

 5 6 1 4 = 5614, which we already saw is divisible by7.

4. Change d to1:5691. 5691 ÷7: Let's compute

---------------

 7*813=5691? 7*800=5600, 7*13=91, so total

---------------

 5691. Yes, divisible. So N=5694 also works.

So both 5624 and 5694 are

---------------

 valid. Since we want the greatest N, 5694 is larger than 5624. So 

---------------

5694 is a candidate.

Wait, so when a=5, we can get N=5694.

---------------

 But the problem asks for the greatest four-digit number with this property. However, maybe there are higher a's? But according to our

---------------

 previous analysis, a must be ≡5 mod7, so a=5 is the only possible digit. So 5694 is the maximum?



---------------

But let me check a=5+7=12, which is invalid as a digit. So yes, a=5 is the only possible

---------------

.

Wait, but maybe there's an error in assuming that the equations must all be satisfied only through the congruences.

---------------

 Let me see if there are other possibilities where a is not ≡5 mod7 but the equations are satisfied through different k, m, n?



---------------

Wait, let's suppose that even if a is not ≡5 mod7, but by choosing different k, m, n (

---------------

the multiples of7), we can adjust b,c,d such that equation1 is satisfied. Because when I expressed b,c,d in terms of a, I considered

---------------

 only their congruences mod7, but their actual values can be higher by adding multiples of7, which could affect equation1.



---------------

Ah! This is a key point. The earlier substitution assumed that the equations for b,c,d are exactly congruent mod7, but their

---------------

 actual values can differ by multiples of7, so perhaps even if a is not ≡5 mod7, choosing appropriate k, m, n can

---------------

 adjust the values so that equation1 is satisfied.

Therefore, my previous conclusion that a must be ≡5 mod7 was

---------------

 only considering the minimal solutions (k,m,n=0), but in reality, by choosing different k,m,n, even with

---------------

 a not ≡5 mod7, we can have equation1 satisfied.

Therefore, my mistake was in not considering that variables

---------------

 b,c,d can be adjusted beyond their mod7 residues by adding 7,14 etc., which would affect the equations

---------------

.

Therefore, let's re-express the variables with the added multiples of7:

Given that:

b = 3a -2 +7k,

c =2a -1 +7m,

d=6a -5 +7n,

where

---------------

 k, m, n are integers (could be positive or negative), such that b,c,d are digits (0-9).



---------------

Then, plugging into equation1:

2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7,

but substituting the

---------------

 expressions:

2*(3a -2 +7k) +3*(2a -1 +7m) + (6a -5 +7n) ≡1 mod7,

As

---------------

 before, this simplifies to:

(18a -12) +7*(2k +3m +n) ≡1 mod7,

Since

---------------

 18a -12 ≡4a +2 mod7,

So 4a +2 +0 ≡1 mod7,



---------------

So 4a +2 ≡1 mod7 --> 4a ≡-1 mod7, which is the

---------------

 same as before.

But here, the 7*(...) term is 0 mod7, so it doesn't affect the congruence. Thus

---------------

, equation1 requires 4a ≡-1 mod7 regardless of k,m,n. Therefore, even if we choose

---------------

 different k,m,n to adjust b,c,d, the requirement on a remains a≡5 mod7. Therefore, a must be

---------------

 ≡5 mod7.

Therefore, even with different k,m,n, the requirement on a is still necessary. Therefore, a

---------------

 must be 5 mod7, so only a=5 is possible as a digit. Hence, the maximum possible a is 5,

---------------

 so the maximum N is 5xxx with a=5, and the maximum possible number would be when b,c,d are as large as possible,

---------------

 given the constraints.

So, with a=5, let's see the possible values for b,c,d again.

From above

---------------

, when a=5:

b ≡6 mod7. So possible b=6 or 13 (invalid). So b=6.

c≡2 mod7,

---------------

 so c=2 or 9.

d≡4 mod7, so d=4 or 11 (invalid),

---------------

 so d=4.

Thus, the two possibilities are:

b=6, c=2, d=4 → N=5624,

or

---------------



b=6, c=9, d=4 → N=5694,

and that's it.

---------------

 Since c can be 2 or9 (the next would be 16 which is too big). So 5694 is the

---------------

 larger one, so that's the maximum N with a=5.

But wait, the problem says "the greatest four-digit positive integer".

---------------

 Is 5694 the maximum possible? But maybe there's a higher a? Wait, according to our analysis, a must be 5 mod

---------------

7, so a=5,12,19,... but since a is a single digit, only 5.

---------------

 Therefore, 5694 is the maximum.

Wait, but let me test a=12. Not possible,

---------------

 since a must be a single digit. So 5 is the highest possible a. Hmm. Let me see if there are

---------------

 other possibilities when a=5 but with different k,m,n?

Wait, for example, can b be 6-7= -1? No, since

---------------

 digits can't be negative. So the only possible values are b=6, c=2 or9, d=4.

Wait

---------------

, but let me check if there are other possibilities if we choose different k,m,n.

Take b=3a -2 +7k.

---------------

 With a=5, 3*5 -2=13. So b=13 +7k. But

---------------

 b must be between0-9, so 13+7k must be ≤9. So k must be negative. Let

---------------

's see:

For k=-1: 13-7=6,

k=-2:13-14=-1 (

---------------

invalid). So only k=0 gives b=13 which is too big, so only k=-1 gives b=6. So that

---------------

's the only valid b.

Similarly, for c=2a -1 +7m. With a=5, that

---------------

's 10-1=9 +7m. To keep c≤9:

9 +7m ≤9 ⇒

---------------

 m≤0,

and c ≥0 ⇒9 +7m ≥0 ⇒ m≥-1 (since 7*(-1)= -7,

---------------

 so 9-7=2).

Therefore m can be -1 or0.

m=0 ⇒c=9,

m=-1 ⇒c=2.

Thus

---------------

, c=2 or9.

For d=6a -5 +7n. With a=5: 30-5=25 +7n.



---------------

d must be between0-9:

25 +7n ≤9 ⇒7n ≤-16 ⇒n≤-3 (since 7*(-3)= -21,

---------------

 25-21=4),

and 25+7n ≥0 ⇒7n ≥-25 ⇒n≥-4 (since -4*7=-28,

---------------

 25-28=-3 <0, so n≥-3.5, so n≥-3).

Thus

---------------

 n can be -3, -2, -1,0:

n=-3:25-21=4,

n=-2:25-14=11 (invalid),

n=-1:25-7=18 (invalid),

n=0:25 (invalid).

Therefore

---------------

 only n=-3 gives d=4. So d=4 only.

Thus, only two options for N:5624 and5694.

---------------

 So 5694 is the larger one.

Therefore, the maximum N is 5694. Wait, but let

---------------

 me check if there are other a's where a≡5 mod7 but with a higher a? Since a must be a

---------------

 digit, 5 is the only one. So 5694 is the maximum.

But the problem says "the greatest four-digit positive integer",

---------------

 so maybe I missed something? Let me test a=5 and see if there is a larger number possible with a different combination

---------------

.

Wait, in the case of a=5, the maximum possible N is 5694. Let me see

---------------

 if there is another a not ≡5 mod7 but still allows a higher N. For example, a=6.



---------------

Wait, let's try a=6 even though according to our previous analysis it shouldn't work, just to check.

a

---------------

=6:

Check if it can satisfy all equations.

First, compute the required congruences:

From Equation7: b≡3a -2 mod7=

---------------

18-2=16 mod7=2 mod7 (since16-14=2). So b≡2 mod7.

---------------

 So b=2,9.

Equation8: c≡2a -1 mod7=12-1=11 mod7=4 mod7. So c=4,11 (invalid).

---------------

 So c=4.

Equation6: d≡6a-5 mod7=36-5=31 mod7=3 mod7 (31-28=3). So d≡3 mod7.

---------------

 So d=3,10 (invalid). So d=3.

Now, check equation1:

2b +3c +d ≡?



---------------

With a=6, possible b=2 or9, c=4, d=3.

First candidate: b=2, c=4, d=3.



---------------

Equation1: 2*2 +3*4 +3 =4+12+3=19 mod7.

---------------

 19 mod7=5, which should be ≡1 mod7. Not good.

Second candidate: b=9, c=4, d=3.

Then

---------------

 equation1: 2*9 +3*4 +3=18+12+3=33 mod7. 33 mod7=5 (

---------------

since 7*4=28, 33-28=5). Still 5≡1? No. So

---------------

 equation1 not satisfied.

Thus, even with a=6, the equation1 isn't satisfied, so a=6 is

---------------

 invalid.

Similarly, try a=12 mod7=5, but a=12 is invalid. So indeed,

---------------

 a=5 is the only possible.

Therefore, the maximum N is 5694. Wait, but let me check

---------------

 another a=5 case where maybe different k,m,n give higher digits? But we saw that only b=6, c=9,

---------------

 d=4 is possible for the higher N.

Wait, let me confirm with a=5, c=9, d

---------------

=4 gives N=5694, which works. Let me check another digit change:

Changing the thousands digit to

---------------

1: 1694. 1694/7=242, which is exact.

Changing hundreds digit to1:51

---------------

94. 5194/7=742, exact.

Changing tens digit to1:5614. 5614/7=802, exact.

Changing units digit to1:5691. 5691/7=813, exact. Yes

---------------

, all work.

Now, is there a higher N? Let's see if there's another a=5 with higher digits?



---------------

Wait, with a=5, c can be 9 (the maximum possible for c with mod7 condition), and d=4. The

---------------

 hundreds digit b is fixed at6. So 5694 is the highest possible with a=5.

Thus, N=5694.

Now

---------------

, the problem asks for Q and R where N divided by1000 gives quotient Q and remainder R. Since N is a four-digit number, Q is the thousands digit, which is5, and R is the last three digits:694. Therefore

---------------

, Q=5, R=694. Thus Q+R=5+694=699.

Wait, but let

---------------

 me verify:

5694 divided by1000 is 5 with remainder 694. So yes

---------------

, 5+694=699.

However, hold on a second. The problem says "Q and R be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when N is divided by 1000".

---------------

 The quotient Q is the number of times 1000 fits into N, so for N=5694, it

---------------

's 5, and the remainder is 694. Therefore, Q+R=5+694=699.

But before

---------------

 I conclude, let me just make sure that 5694 is indeed the maximum N. Let me see if there's

---------------

 a possibility of a higher N with a different combination.

Wait, let me check if there's another a=5 with a

---------------

 different b,c,d? For example, can c be 9 and d something else? But d must be ≡4 mod7, so only

---------------

 4 or11 (invalid). So d=4 is only option. So no.

Alternatively, if there is another

---------------

 set of equations where a is not 5, but through different k,m,n values, but as we saw, that's

---------------

 impossible because a must be ≡5 mod7.

Therefore, I think 5694 is correct. So the answer should

---------------

 be 5+694=699, so 699.

Wait, but I need to check

---------------

 the problem once again to ensure I didn't misinterpret anything.

Problem statement:

"whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7"



---------------

Yes, so changing any single digit to 1 must make it divisible by7. We checked all four cases for N=5694, and they worked

---------------

.

Therefore, I think the answer is 699.

Wait, but let me check another possible N just in case. Suppose

---------------

 someone thinks a=4 mod7 or something else, but no.

Alternatively, maybe there's another a=5 case where

---------------

 c is 9, and b is higher? But b must be 6 mod7, so 6 or 13 (

---------------

invalid). So no.

Thus, I think the final answer is 699.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{699}


To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number \( N \) such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We then need to compute \( Q + R \) where \( Q \) is the quotient and \( R \) is the remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000.

We denote the digits of \( N \) as \( a, b, c, d \) such

---------------

 that \( N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \). The

---------------

 conditions given translate to four congruence equations modulo 7. After setting up and simplifying these equations, we derive the following key equations

---------------

:

1. \( 2b + 3c + d \equiv 1 \mod 7 \)
2. \( 6a + 3c + d \equiv 5 \mod 7 \)
3. \( 6a + 2b + d \equiv 4 \mod 7 \)
4. \( 6a + 2b + 3c \equiv 6 \mod 7 \)

Through solving

---------------

 these equations, we find that \( a \) must be congruent to 5 modulo 7. The only valid digit for \( a \) is

---------------

 5. Substituting \( a = 5 \) into the equations, we find:

- \( b \equiv 6 \mod 7 \) (so \( b = 6 \))
- \( c \equiv 2 \mod 7 \) (so \( c = 2 \) or \( 9 \))
- \( d \equiv 4 \mod 7 \) (so \( d = 4 \))

The largest

---------------

 possible number with these digits is \( N = 5694 \) (choosing the largest \( c = 9 \)).

---------------

 Verifying all conditions, we confirm \( 5694 \) meets the requirements.

When \( N = 5694 \) is divided by 1000, the quotient \( Q \) is 5 and the remainder \( R \) is 694. Thus, \( Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699 \).

The final answer is \
