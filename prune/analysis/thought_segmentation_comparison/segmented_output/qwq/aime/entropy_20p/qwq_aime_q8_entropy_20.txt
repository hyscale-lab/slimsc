Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where there are two real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, and they satisfy these logarithmic equations: log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^(4y) also equals 10. And

---------------

 I need to find the product xy. Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but maybe I can convert them to exponential form or use some logarithm properties to simplify.

First, let me write down the given equations again

---------------

 to make sure I have them right:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

Alright

---------------

, starting with the first equation. Remember that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So maybe I can apply that property here. Let's try that

---------------

 for the first equation:

log_x(y^x) = x * log_x(y) = 10. 

So, that

---------------

 simplifies to x * log_x(y) = 10. Hmm, log_x(y) is the exponent you need to raise x to get y. Let me denote log_x(y) as some variable to make it easier. Let's say let’s set

---------------

 a = log_x(y). Then by definition of logarithm, x^a = y. 

So substituting back into the first equation, we

---------------

 have x * a = 10. But since a is log_x(y), which is log_x(y) = a, so

---------------

 that gives x * log_x(y) = 10. Hmm, maybe another way to think about it. Alternatively, using

---------------

 the identity that log_b(b^k) = k. Wait, but here the base is x and the argument is y^x, so maybe

---------------

 not directly applicable. Wait, but if I can express log_x(y^x) as x * log_x(y), which

---------------

 is what I did before. 

Alternatively, using the change of base formula, log_x(y^x) can be written as (ln(y^x))/(

---------------

ln(x)) = (x ln y)/(ln x) = 10. So that gives x*(ln y / ln x) = 10. 



---------------

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Applying the same logarithm power rule:

---------------

 4y * log_y(x) = 10. Let me denote log_y(x) as another variable, maybe b. Let

---------------

 me see.

Alternatively, using natural logs again: log_y(x^{4y}) = (ln x^{4y}) / ln y = (4y ln x)/ln y = 10. 

So,

---------------

 now I have two equations:

1. (x ln y) / ln x = 10

2. (4y ln x) / ln y = 10

Hmm, so

---------------

 maybe if I let’s denote ln x as A and ln y as B. Let me try that substitution. Let A = ln x and B = ln y. Then,

---------------

 since x and y are greater than 1, A and B are positive real numbers.

Then, equation 1 becomes (

---------------

x * B)/A = 10. But x is e^A, right? Because ln x = A =>

---------------

 x = e^A. Similarly, y = e^B. So substituting x = e^A and y = e^B into equation 1:

(e^A * B)/A = 10



---------------

Similarly, equation 2: (4y * A)/B = 10. Substituting y = e^B:



---------------

(4 * e^B * A)/B = 10

Hmm, so now I have two equations in terms of A and B:

1. (e^A * B)/A = 10

2. (4 * e^B * A)/B = 10

This

---------------

 looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can manipulate them to find a relationship between A and B. Let me see.

Let me denote

---------------

 equation 1 as:

(e^A * B) = 10 A → e^A * B = 10 A →

---------------

 e^A = (10 A)/B → equation 1a

Equation 2:

4 e^B * A = 10 B → e^B = (10 B)/(4 A) → equation 2a

Hmm

---------------

, so now equation 1a gives e^A in terms of A and B, and equation 2a gives e^B in terms of A and B. Maybe I

---------------

 can substitute one into the other?

Alternatively, perhaps multiply the two equations together. Let me see:

Multiply equation 1 and

---------------

 equation 2:

(e^A * B / A) * (4 e^B * A / B) ) = 10 * 10 = 100

S

---------------

implify left side:

(e^A * B / A) * (4 e^B * A / B) = (

---------------

e^A * e^B) * (B / A) * (4 A / B) ) 

The B cancels, A cancels, so we

---------------

 have e^(A+B) *4 = 100

Therefore:

e^(A+B) = 100 / 4 = 25

Thus

---------------

, e^(A+B) = 25 → A + B = ln(25)

So that's a relationship

---------------

 between A and B. Let me note that:

A + B = ln(25) = ln(5^2) = 2 ln 5.

---------------

 

So, A + B = 2 ln 5.

Now, perhaps I can use this in equations 1a and 2a.



---------------

From equation 1a: e^A = (10 A)/B

From equation 2a: e^B = (10 B)/(4 A) = (5 B)/(2 A)

Let

---------------

 me see if I can express e^(A+B) as e^A * e^B. Since e^(A+B) = e^A * e^B =

---------------

25 (from earlier). 

So substituting e^A and e^B from equations 1a and 2a:

e

---------------

^A * e^B = (10A / B) * (5B / 2A) ) = (10A /

---------------

 B)*(5B)/(2A) 

Simplify:

The A cancels, the B cancels, so:

(10 *5)/(2) = 50/2 =25.

---------------

 

Which matches e^(A+B)=25. So that checks out. So that doesn't give us new information,

---------------

 just confirms the consistency. 

Hmm, so I need another way to relate A and B. Let me see. Since A + B = 2 ln5, perhaps

---------------

 express B = 2 ln5 - A, then substitute into equation 1a or 2a.

Let me try substit

---------------

uting into equation 1a:

From equation 1a: e^A = (10 A)/B

But B = 2 ln5 - A.

---------------

 So,

e^A = (10 A)/(2 ln5 - A)

Similarly, equation 2a gives e

---------------

^B = (5 B)/(2 A). Let me see if using B = 2 ln5 - A here would

---------------

 also give the same equation?

Alternatively, perhaps pick one equation and work with it. Let me focus on equation 1a and

---------------

 substitute B = 2 ln5 - A into it. 

So:

e^A = (10 A)/(2 ln5 - A)

This

---------------

 is an equation in terms of A. Let me denote C = A for simplicity. Then,

e^C = (10 C)/(2 ln5 - C)

Hmm

---------------

, solving for C here might not be straightforward algebraically. Maybe need to think of possible values that satisfy this equation? Since

---------------

 x and y are greater than 1, so A and B must be positive. Also, since B = 2 ln5 - C, so

---------------

 2 ln5 - C must be positive, so C < 2 ln5. 

Alternatively, maybe assume that A and B are multiples of ln5?

---------------

 Let me see. Let me try some substitutions. Let me suppose that A = k ln5 and B = (2 -k) ln5,

---------------

 since A + B = 2 ln5. 

Let me try that substitution. Let A = k ln5, so B = (2 -k) ln5. Then

---------------

 plug into equation 1a:

e^{k ln5} = (10 * k ln5)/ [ (2 -k) ln5 ]

Simplify left

---------------

 side: e^{k ln5} = 5^k

Right side: (10 k ln5)/[

---------------

 (2 -k) ln5 ] = 10k/(2 -k)

So equation becomes:

5^k = 10k/(2 -k)

Hmm, so

---------------

 now we have an equation in terms of k. Let me see if I can find a k such that this holds. Let

---------------

 me try some integer values.

First, let me see if k is an integer. Let me try k=1:

Left:5^1 =5.

---------------

 Right:10*1/(2-1)=10. Not equal.

k=2: Left:25.

---------------

 Right:10*2/(0) → division by zero. Not allowed.

k=0: Left:1. Right:0/(2)

---------------

 =0. Not equal.

k= 0.5: Let's try fractions. k=1/2:

Left: sqrt(5) ≈2.236. Right: 10*(0.5)/(2 -0.5)=5/1.5≈3.333. Not equal.

k= 

---------------

1. Let's see, tried that. k= 1. Let me try k= 2/3:

Left:5^(2/3)≈ cube

---------------

 root of 25 ≈2.924. Right:10*(2/3)/(2 -2/3)= (20/3)/(4/3)=5. So

---------------

 5 vs approx2.924. Not equal.

Hmm, not quite. Maybe k= 1. Let

---------------

 me check again. Wait, k=1 gives left 5, right 10. Not equal. Hmm.

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps k= (something else). Let me see, suppose k= ln something? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe try

---------------

 to set up an equation where 5^k (2 -k) =10k.

So 5^k (2 -k) -10k =0. Let

---------------

 me see if I can find a solution numerically.

Let me try k=1. Let's see:

5^1*(2-1) -10*1 =5*1 -10= -5.

---------------

 Negative.

At k=0. Let's see, 5^0*(2 -0) -10*0=2

---------------

 -0=2>0.

So between k=0 and k=1, the function goes from 2 to -5. So by

---------------

 Intermediate Value Theorem, there's a root between 0 and1.

Similarly, between k=1 and k approaching 2,

---------------

 let's see at k=1.5:

5^1.5 is sqrt(5^3)=sqrt(125)=~

---------------

11.18. So 11.18*(2-1.5)=11.18*0.5≈5.59.

---------------

 10*1.5=15. So 5.59-15≈-9.41 <

---------------

0.

Hmm, so between k=0 and1, it crosses zero. Let me try k=0.5:



---------------

5^0.5≈2.236*(2-0.5)=2.236*1.5≈3.354. 10*0.5=5. So 3.354-5≈-1.646.

---------------

 Negative.

Wait, so at k=0, the value was 2, at k=0.5 it's -

---------------

1.6, so between 0 and 0.5?

Wait, k=0.25:

5^0.25≈

---------------

sqrt(sqrt(5))≈1.495. (2 -0.25)=1.75. So

---------------

 1.495*1.75≈2.616. 10*0.25=2.5. So 2.616 -2.5≈0.116.

---------------

 Positive.

So between 0.25 and 0.5.

At k=0.3:

5^0.3 �

---------------

� e^{0.3 ln5} ≈ e^{0.3*1.609}≈e^{0.4827}≈1.620.

(

---------------

2 -0.3)=1.7. 1.620 *1.7≈2.754. 10*0.3=3. So 2.754 -3≈-0.246. Negative

---------------

.

Hmm, so between 0.25 and 0.3:

At k=0.25, value

---------------

≈0.116, at k=0.3≈-0.246. Let me try k=0.275:

5^0.275 �

---------------

� e^{0.275 *1.609}≈e^{0.4429}≈1.557.

(2-0.275)=1.725. 1.557 *1.725≈2.687

---------------

. 10*0.275=2.75. 2.687-2.75≈-0.063. Close

---------------

.

k=0.26:

5^0.26 ≈ e^{0.26*1.609}=e

---------------

^{0.418}≈1.519.

(2-0.26)=1.74. 1.519*1.74≈2.648

---------------

. 10*0.26=2.6. 2.648-2.6≈0.048.

So

---------------

 between 0.26 and 0.275. Let me try k=0.265:

5^0.265≈

---------------

 e^{0.265*1.609}= e^{0.426}≈1.531.

1.531*(2 -0.265)=1.531*(1.735)≈1.531*1.73

---------------

5≈2.657. 10*0.265=2.65. So 2.657-2.65≈0.007.

Very

---------------

 close. So at k≈0.265, the value is approximately 0.007. Close to zero. 



---------------

k=0.266:

0.266*1.609≈0.428. e^0.428≈1.534.

(

---------------

2 -0.266)=1.734. 1.534*1.734≈2.66.

---------------

 10*0.266≈2.66. So 2.66 -2.66≈0. So

---------------

 that's the solution?

Wait, so k≈0.266. Let me check:

k=0.266:



---------------

Left side:5^0.266 ≈ e^{0.266*1.609}

---------------

 ≈ e^{0.428} ≈1.534.

Right side:10k/(2 -k) =1

---------------

0*(0.266)/(1.734)=2.66/1.734≈1.534. 



---------------

Yes, so that works. So k≈0.266. But that's an approximate solution. But since the problem is

---------------

 likely expecting an exact answer, maybe there's an exact value here. Hmm, perhaps my substitution with k is complicating things

---------------

? Maybe there's another approach.

Let me go back to the original equations and see if I can manipulate them differently.

Original

---------------

 equations:

1. log_x(y^x) =10 → x log_x(y)=10 → log_x(y)=10/x



---------------

2. log_y(x^{4y})=10 →4y log_y(x)=10 → log_y(x)=10/(4y)=5/(2y)

But note

---------------

 that log_x(y) and log_y(x) are reciprocals. Because log_b(a) = 1/(log_a(b)). So, log_x(y) =1/(

---------------

log_y(x)). 

Therefore, from equation 1 and 2:

log_x(y)=10/x and log_y(x)=5/(2y). 



---------------

But since log_x(y)=1/(log_y(x)), so substituting:

10/x = 1/(5/(2y)) =

---------------

 2y/5

Therefore, 10/x = (2y)/5 → cross multiplying: 10*5 = 2y*x

---------------

 → 50=2xy → xy=25. Wait, that's straightforward?

Wait, that seems much simpler. Did

---------------

 I overcomplicate it earlier?

Let me check again. 

Yes, because log_x(y) = 10/x,

---------------

 and log_y(x)=5/(2y). Since they are reciprocals:

log_x(y) = 1/(log_y(x))

---------------

 → 10/x = 1/(5/(2y)) → 10/x = 2y/5 → cross multiply:

---------------

 10*5 = 2y*x → 50=2xy → xy=25. So that

---------------

's it. So the answer is 25?

Wait, that's way simpler. Why didn't I think of that earlier?

---------------

 Because I got bogged down in substitution with A and B. So that was a better approach. 

So, let me verify

---------------

 this. Let me see:

Given that log_x(y^x)=10, so log_x(y^x)=x log_x(y)=10 →

---------------

 log_x(y)=10/x.

Similarly, log_y(x^{4y})=4y log_y(x)=10 → log_y(x)=10/(4y)=5/(2y).

Since

---------------

 log_x(y) = 1/log_y(x), so substituting:

10/x = 1/(5/(2y)) → 10/x = 2y/5 → cross multiply:

---------------

 50 = 2xy → xy=25. 

So the answer is 25. 

Hmm, that

---------------

 was straightforward. I overcomplicated it by going into natural logs and substitutions. But that's a common pitfall. So

---------------

, the key was to recognize the reciprocal relationship between the two logarithms. 

Let me just check if that's consistent with my earlier equations

---------------

 where I had A + B = 2 ln5. If xy=25, then x and y are numbers such that their product is 25. Let me see if

---------------

 that holds with the other equations.

Suppose xy=25. Let me pick numbers. Let me suppose x=5, then y=5. But then

---------------

 check the equations. Wait, let me see:

Suppose x=5 and y=5. Then log_x(y^x)=log_5(5^5)=5, which is not 10. So that doesn't work. Hmm

---------------

, so maybe x and y are not 5 each, but their product is 25. Let me see.

Alternatively

---------------

, suppose x= sqrt(25)=5, but same as before. Maybe x and y are different.

Suppose x= sqrt

---------------

(25)=5, then y=5, which didn't work. Let me try another pair. Let me see

---------------

.

Suppose x= something else. Let me think, let me suppose that xy=25, so y=25/x. Let

---------------

 me plug into the equations.

First equation: log_x(y^x)= log_x( (25/x)^x )=x

---------------

 * log_x(25/x). Let me compute that.

log_x(25/x) = log_x(25) - log_x(x) = log_x(25) -1. So

---------------

 the first equation becomes x*(log_x(25) -1)=10.

Similarly, log_x(25) is log_x(5^2)=2 log_x(5). Let me set

---------------

 that as 2 log_x(5). Hmm, but maybe this is getting too involved again.

Alternatively, since we already

---------------

 derived through reciprocal relationship that xy=25, and that's consistent with the equations, perhaps that is the answer. Since

---------------

 the problem states that such real numbers exist, so the answer is 25.

Alternatively, to confirm, let me suppose

---------------

 that xy=25, so y=25/x. Then let me see if the original equations can be satisfied.

Take

---------------

 first equation: log_x(y^x)=10. Since y=25/x, then y^x=(25/x)^x. So

---------------

 log_x( (25/x)^x ) = log_x(25^x /x^x )= log_x( (25/x)^x )=x log

---------------

_x(25/x)=x [log_x(25) - log_x(x)] =x [log_x(25) -1].

---------------

 

Set this equal to 10:

x [log_x(25) -1] =10.

Let me let

---------------

’s denote log_x(25) as k. Then x*(k -1)=10. But k is log_x(25)= ln

---------------

25/lnx. Hmm, maybe another substitution.

Alternatively, let me write log_x(25)= log_x(5^2)=2 log_x(5). Let me set

---------------

 log_x(5)=m. Then log_x(25)=2m, so equation becomes x*(2m -1)=10.

Also, since

---------------

 m=log_x(5), that means x^m =5. So x^m=5 → x=5^{1/m}.

Hmm

---------------

, so substituting x=5^{1/m} into the equation:

5^{1/m}*(2m -1)=10.



---------------

This seems a bit complex, but maybe pick a value of m that makes this equation true. Let me see if m=1:



---------------

Then x=5^{1}=5. Then 5*(2*1 -1)=5*1=5≠10. Not good.

m=2:

x=5^{1/2}=sqrt(5). Then sqrt(5)*(2*2 -1)=sqrt(5)*3≈6.708≠10.

m= (

---------------

something else). Let me see:

Suppose 2m -1 = 10/(5^{1/m} )



---------------

Let me suppose that m= log_x(5). Let me see, perhaps m=2:

Wait, maybe m= log

---------------

_x(5)=2, so x= sqrt(5). Then equation is sqrt(5)*(4-1)=sqrt

---------------

(5)*3≈6.708, not 10.

Hmm, perhaps m= log_x(5)= (

---------------

ln5)/lnx. Let me see:

Alternatively, maybe m= log_x(5)= t, so x=5^{1/t}



---------------

Then equation: 5^{1/t}*(2t -1)=10.

This is a transcendental equation,

---------------

 which may not have an algebraic solution. But since the problem states that real numbers exist, so there must be a solution. Since

---------------

 we already derived through the reciprocal relationship that xy=25, and that comes from valid manipulations, perhaps that's sufficient

---------------

, even if we can’t find exact x and y, but the question only asks for xy, so 25 is the answer. 



---------------

Therefore, I think the answer is 25.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{25}


Given the equations \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\), we start by using logarithm properties to simplify them.

For the first equation:
\[
\log_x(y^x) = x \log_x(y) = 10
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x}
\]

For the second equation:
\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\log_y(x) = \frac{10}{4y} = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

We know that \(\log_x(y)\) and \(\log_y(x)\) are reciprocals of each other. Therefore:
\[
\log_x(y) = \frac{1}{\log_y(x)}
\]

Substituting the expressions we found:
\[
\frac{10}{x} = \frac{1}{\frac{5}{2y}}
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side:
\[
\frac{10}{x} = \frac{2y}{5}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
10 \cdot 5 = 2y \cdot x
\]
\[
50 = 2xy
\]
\[
xy = 25
\]

Thus, the product \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).<|im_end|>
