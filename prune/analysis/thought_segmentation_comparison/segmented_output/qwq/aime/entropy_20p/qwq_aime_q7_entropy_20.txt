Okay, so I need to find the number of triples (a, b, c) of nonnegative integers such that a + b + c = 300 and the expression a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b equals 6,000,000. Hmm, that

---------------

 seems a bit complex at first glance, but maybe I can break it down.

First, let me note that the problem is

---------------

 about three variables adding up to 300, and a symmetric expression involving their squares and products. Since the equation is symmetric in a, b, and c, maybe there

---------------

's a way to exploit that symmetry. Perhaps I can assume some ordering, like a ≤ b ≤ c, solve it under that condition

---------------

, and then multiply by the number of permutations? But before jumping into that, let me see if I can manipulate the given equations algebra

---------------

ically.

The first equation is straightforward: a + b + c = 300. The second equation is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Let

---------------

 me see if I can factor or rewrite that expression to make it simpler.

Looking at the terms in the second equation, each term is of the form (

---------------

variable)^2 multiplied by another variable. For example, a²b and a²c are terms where a is squared and multiplied by the

---------------

 other variables. Since the expression is symmetric, maybe we can factor it somehow?

Alternatively, notice that the expression can be rewritten as:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Yes

---------------

, that seems right. Let me check:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)

Similarly for the other terms. So the

---------------

 entire expression is:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Now

---------------

, since a + b + c = 300, we can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), (a + c) with (300 - b), and (a + b) with (300 - c). Let me try that substitution.

So substit

---------------

uting:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that

---------------

's interesting. So now the equation becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm

---------------

. Maybe I can consider each term individually. Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300,

---------------

 so each term is like x²(S - x). Let me see if I can find some relationship here.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 expanding the original expression might help? Let me see:

Wait, the original expression is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Let me note

---------------

 that this can also be written as (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc. Wait

---------------

, let me verify that.

Let me compute (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca):

(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a(ab) + a(bc) + a(ca) + b(ab) + b(bc) + b(ca) + c(ab) + c(bc) + c(ca)

Simplify each term:

= a²b + abc + a²c + ab² + b²c + abc + abc + bc² + c²a

Wait

---------------

, that's a bit messy. Let me collect like terms:

The terms with a²b, a²c, b²a, b²c, c²a, c²b are

---------------

 all present once, except for the cross terms like abc. How many abc terms are there?

Looking at the expansion, each

---------------

 of the three variables (a, b, c) is multiplied by the other two terms, so:

Each term like a*(bc) gives

---------------

 abc, similarly for b*(ac) and c*(ab). So there are three abc terms. So the total expansion is:

(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = (a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b) + 3abc

Therefore, rearr

---------------

anged:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc

So

---------------

 that's a useful identity! Therefore, the given equation can be rewritten as:

(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000

But

---------------

 we know that a + b + c = 300, so substituting that in:

300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000

Hmm

---------------

, so that gives another equation involving ab + bc + ca and abc. Let me write that down:

300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000

Let

---------------

 me divide both sides by 3 to simplify:

100*(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000

So now

---------------

, the problem reduces to solving the system:

1. a + b + c = 300

2. 100*(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000

Hmm. Now

---------------

, perhaps I can let variables x = a, y = b, z = c. But maybe there's a substitution here

---------------

. Let me think.

Alternatively, let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, P = abc, and Q = ab + bc + ca. Then the

---------------

 second equation becomes:

100*Q - P = 2,000,000

So,

---------------

 P = 100*Q - 2,000,000

But we also know that

---------------

 in terms of symmetric sums, for three variables:

(a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca)

So

---------------

, S² = (a² + b² + c²) + 2Q

Therefore, a² + b² + c² = S² - 2Q = 300² - 2Q = 90,000 - 2Q

But I'm not sure if that helps yet

---------------

. Alternatively, perhaps we can think of variables in terms of symmetric polynomials. But maybe we can consider some substitution here.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 we can let variables be in terms of two variables. Since a + b + c = 300, we can express

---------------

 c = 300 - a - b. Then substitute into the second equation and see if we can find possible integer

---------------

 solutions.

Let me try that approach. Let me set c = 300 - a - b. Then substitute into the second equation.



---------------

First, let me recall that the second equation is:

100*(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000

Let

---------------

 me compute ab + bc + ca and abc in terms of a and b.

First, compute ab + bc + ca:

ab + bc + ca = ab + b*(300 - a - b) + a*(300 - a - b)

Let me expand each

---------------

 term:

ab + [300b - ab - b²] + [300a - a² - ab]

Combine

---------------

 terms:

ab + 300b - ab - b² + 300a - a² - ab

Combine

---------------

 like terms:

The ab terms: ab - ab - ab = -ab

The 300b and 300a: 300a

---------------

 + 300b

The -a² - b² terms

So altogether:

-ab + 300a + 300b - a² - b²

Therefore

---------------

, ab + bc + ca = -a² - b² - ab + 300a + 300b

Hmm

---------------

, okay. Then, the term abc is a*b*(300 - a - b)

Therefore, substituting into the equation:

100*(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 100*(-a² - b² - ab + 300a + 300b) - [a*b*(300 - a - b)] = 2,000,000

This

---------------

 looks complicated, but let me try expanding it step by step.

First, compute 100*(ab + bc + ca):

100*(-a² - b² - ab + 300a + 300b) = -100a² - 100b² - 100ab + 30,000a + 30,000b

Then subtract abc:



---------------

- [a*b*(300 - a - b)] = -300ab + a²b + ab²

Therefore, the

---------------

 entire left-hand side becomes:

(-100a² - 100b² - 100ab + 30,000a + 30,000b) + (-300ab + a²b + ab²) = 2,000,000

Combine

---------------

 like terms:

First, the a² terms: -100a² + a²b (Wait, a²b is a cubic term, so

---------------

 actually, let me re-express all terms properly:

Wait, perhaps I need to group all terms by their degrees. Let me see

---------------

:

Starting from the first part:

-100a² -100b² -100ab + 30,000a + 30,000b

Then

---------------

 the second part:

-300ab + a²b + ab²

So combining all together:

-100a² -100b² -100ab -300ab + a²b + ab² + 30,000a + 30,000b

Combine

---------------

 like terms:

The a² terms: -100a² + a²b (Wait, a²b is degree

---------------

 3, so maybe better to list terms by degree:

First, cubic terms: a²b + ab²

Quadratic terms: -100a² -100b² - (100ab + 300ab) = -100a² -100b² -400ab

Linear terms: 30,000a + 30,000b

So

---------------

 putting it all together:

a²b + ab² -100a² -100b² -400ab + 30,000a + 30,000b = 2,000,000

Hmm, this still

---------------

 looks quite complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider symmetry here.

Alternatively, maybe if I

---------------

 assume two variables are equal. Since the problem is symmetric, perhaps the solutions occur when two variables are equal? Let me test

---------------

 that idea.

Suppose that two variables are equal, say a = b. Then, since a + b + c = 300, we

---------------

 have c = 300 - 2a. Then, let's substitute into the equation.

Let me try that

---------------

. Let a = b. Then c = 300 - 2a. Let me compute the second equation:



---------------

Original equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

Since a = b, this

---------------

 becomes:

a²a + a²c + a²a + a²c + c²a + c²a = 6,000,000

Wait, let

---------------

 me compute term by term:

a²b = a^3

a²c = a²c

b²a = a^3

b²c = a²c

c²a = c²a

c²b = c²a (since a = b)

So

---------------

 altogether, the terms are:

a^3 + a²c + a^3 + a²c + c²a + c²a

Combine

---------------

 like terms:

2a^3 + 2a²c + 2a c²

Factor out 2a:

2a(a² + a c + c²) = 6,000,000

But

---------------

 c = 300 - 2a, so substitute that in:

2a[ a² + a(300 - 2a) + (300 - 2a)^2 ] = 6,000,000

Let

---------------

 me compute the expression inside the brackets step by step.

First term: a²

Second term: a*(300 - 2a) = 300a - 2a²

Third term: (300 - 2a)^2 = 300² - 4*300a + 4a² = 90,000 - 1200a + 4a²

Adding

---------------

 all three terms together:

a² + (300a - 2a²) + (90,000 - 1200a + 4a²) =

Combine

---------------

 like terms:

a² - 2a² + 4a² = 3a²

300a - 1200a = -900a

And

---------------

 the constant term: 90,000

So altogether, the expression inside the brackets is 3a² - 900a + 90,000.

Therefore, the equation becomes:

2a*(3a² - 900a + 90,000) = 6,000,000

S

---------------

implify left side:

Multiply 2a with each term:

6a³ - 1800a² + 180,000a = 6,000,000

Bring

---------------

 all terms to left side:

6a³ - 1800a² + 180,000a - 6,000,000 = 0

Divide both sides by 6 to simplify:

a³ - 300a² + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0

Hmm, so

---------------

 we have a cubic equation here. Let me see if I can factor this.

Looking for rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. The possible roots are factors of 1,000,000 divided by 1, so possible integer roots are ±1, ±2, ..., up

---------------

 to ±1,000,000. But given the context, a must be a nonnegative integer such

---------------

 that c = 300 - 2a is also nonnegative. So 300 - 2a ≥ 0 →

---------------

 a ≤ 150. So a is between 0 and 150.

Therefore, possible integer roots between

---------------

 0 and 150. Let me test a = 100. Let me plug in a=100:

100³ - 300*(100)^2 + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000

= 1,000,000 - 300*10,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000

=

---------------

 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 -1,000,000 = 0



---------------

Oh! So a=100 is a root. Therefore, (a - 100) is a factor.

Let me perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor the

---------------

 cubic.

Dividing a³ - 300a² + 30,000a - 1,000,000 by (a - 100):

Using synthetic division:

100 | 1  -300   30,000   -1,000,000

Multiply

---------------

 100*1 = 100, add to -300 → -200

100*(-200) = -20,000; add to 30,000 → 10,000

100*(10,000) = 1,000,000; add to -1,000,000 → 0

So

---------------

 the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a² - 200a + 10,000)



---------------

Now, factor the quadratic: a² - 200a + 10,000

Let me see

---------------

 if this factors. The discriminant is (200)^2 - 4*1*10,000 = 40,000 - 40,000 = 0. So it's a perfect square.



---------------

Thus, quadratic is (a - 100)^2. Therefore, the cubic factors as (a - 100)^3 = 0.



---------------

Therefore, the only real root is a = 100 (with multiplicity 3). Therefore, the only solution when

---------------

 a = b is a = 100, so then c = 300 - 2*100 = 100. So

---------------

 (a, b, c) = (100, 100, 100). But wait

---------------

, if a = b = c = 100, then that's a valid solution. Let me check if this satisfies the original equation.

Check

---------------

 the second equation: a²b + a²c + ... etc. Let's compute:

Each term like a²b would

---------------

 be 100²*100 = 1,000,000. Since there are six terms (each permutation), total

---------------

 is 6*1,000,000 = 6,000,000. Yes

---------------

, that works. So that's one solution where all three variables are equal to 100.

But are there other solutions where variables

---------------

 are not all equal? Because the problem says "triples of nonnegative integers", so maybe there are more solutions where two variables are equal but

---------------

 different from 100, or maybe all different?

Hmm. Since when assuming a = b, the only solution is a

---------------

 = b = c = 100, but perhaps there are solutions where variables are not equal. Let me think.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe we can consider the case where one variable is zero. Let's suppose c = 0. Then the equations become:

a + b = 300,



---------------

and the second equation becomes a²b + a²*0 + b²a + b²*0 + 0²a + 0²b = a²b + ab² = ab(a + b) = ab*300 = 6,000,000.

Therefore

---------------

, ab*300 = 6,000,000 → ab = 20,000.

So,

---------------

 we need two nonnegative integers a and b such that a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000.

So

---------------

 solving for a and b. Let me set up equations:

Let a and b be such that:

a + b = 300

ab = 20,000

These

---------------

 are the standard equations for quadratic: x² - 300x + 20,000 = 0

Let

---------------

 me compute discriminant D = 300² - 4*1*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000

sqrt

---------------

(D) = 100

Therefore, solutions are x = [300 ± 100]/2 → (400)/2 = 200 or

---------------

 (200)/2 = 100. So a and b are 200 and 100.

---------------

 So the solutions when c=0 are (200, 100, 0) and (100, 200, 0). But

---------------

 since variables are nonnegative integers and order matters, but in the problem statement, the triples are ordered, so (200,100,0), (100,200,0), and

---------------

 similarly with c in other positions.

Wait, but if c = 0, then the triples would have c in any of the three positions. So

---------------

 actually, the solutions when one variable is zero would be permutations of (200, 100, 0). How

---------------

 many permutations are there?

Since two variables are distinct (200 and 100) and the third is zero. The number of distinct permutations is 3 (cho

---------------

osing which variable is zero) multiplied by 2 (the arrangement of the other two), so total 3*2=6?

---------------

 Wait, no: actually, if one variable is fixed as zero, the other two can be arranged in 2 ways,

---------------

 so for each choice of which variable is zero, there are two permutations. Since there are three variables that could be zero, total

---------------

 is 3*2 = 6.

But let me confirm. For example, if c is zero, then (a,b,c) can be (200,100,0) or (100,200,0). Similarly, if b is zero, then (a,0,c) can

---------------

 be (200,0,100) or (100,0,200). And if a is zero, then (0,200,100) or (0,100,200). So total

---------------

 6 solutions where one variable is zero and the other two are 200 and 100.

Therefore, these

---------------

 are valid solutions. So that's another set of solutions. So now, we have at least 7 solutions: the all-100s

---------------

 triple, and the six permutations with two variables 200, 100, and 0. But maybe

---------------

 there are more solutions?

Wait, let me see if there are solutions where two variables are zero. Suppose two variables are zero, say b = c = 0. Then a = 300. Then compute

---------------

 the second equation:

a²b + ... all terms would be zero except terms with a²*0 etc., so the

---------------

 entire expression is zero, which is not 6,000,000. So that doesn't work. Similarly

---------------

, any two variables being zero would result in the expression being zero. So no solutions there.

Alternatively, what if all three variables are different?

---------------

 Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps there are other solutions where variables are not equal and none are zero. Let me consider.



---------------

Suppose that a, b, c are all different and non-zero. Let me see if such a solution exists.

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 there are solutions where two variables are equal but not 100. Wait, when we assumed a = b, we only

---------------

 got the solution where all three are 100, so perhaps that's the only case when two variables are equal.

---------------

 Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe another case where variables are in some other proportion. Let me think of another approach.

Let me recall

---------------

 that the equation after substitution became 100Q - P = 2,000,000 where Q = ab + bc + ca and P = abc.



---------------

Also, we know that a + b + c = 300.

Perhaps we can use some inequality here? Let

---------------

 me see.

Alternatively, maybe we can think in terms of variables x, y, z, but I need to think differently

---------------

.

Alternatively, let me consider that when all variables are equal, that gives one solution. When one variable is zero, that

---------------

 gives six solutions. Are there others?

Wait, let me check another case. Suppose two variables are equal but not 100. Let

---------------

 me see.

Suppose a = b, but not 100, so then c = 300 - 2a.

---------------

 Let me see if there are other a where the equation holds. Wait, earlier when we set a = b, the equation

---------------

 reduced to (a - 100)^3 = 0, so only a =100 is a solution.

---------------

 Therefore, no other solutions with two variables equal except when all three are equal. So that case only gives the all 100s

---------------

 triple.

So maybe the only solutions are the all 100s and the permutations with 200,100,0.

---------------

 Let me check another case where maybe one variable is 150. Let me try some numbers.

Suppose a = 150, b = 150, then c = 0. Then

---------------

 check the second equation.

a²b + a²c + ... Let's see:

a = 150, b = 150, c =0.



---------------

Compute the expression:

a²b = 150²*150 = 150^3 =

---------------

 3,375,000

a²c = 0

Similarly, b²a = same as a²b,

---------------

 so another 3,375,000

b²c = 0

c²a + c²b = 0

Total

---------------

 sum: 3,375,000 + 3,375,000 = 6,750,000 which is more

---------------

 than 6,000,000. So that's too big.

Hmm. How about a = 15

---------------

0, b = 100, c = 50.

Check the sum: 150 + 100 +50 = 300.

---------------

 Okay.

Compute the expression:

a²b = 150²*100 = 22500*100 = 2,250,000

a²c = 150²*50 = 22500*50 = 1,125,000

b²a = 100²*150 = 10,000*150 = 1,500,000

b²c = 100²*50 = 500,000

c²a =50²*150 =2,500*150 = 375,000

c²b =50²*100 =2,500*100 =250,000

Total

---------------

 sum: 2,250,000 + 1,125,000 +1,500,000 +500,000 +375,000 +250,000



---------------

Let me add step by step:

2,250,000 + 1,125,000 = 3,375,000

+1,500,000 → 4,875,000

+500,000 → 5,375,000

+375,000 → 5,750,000

+250,000 → 6,000,000.

---------------

 Oh! Wait, that works!

Wait, so (150, 100, 50) gives

---------------

 exactly 6,000,000. So that's another solution. Hmm, so my previous thought that only the all

---------------

 100s and the permutations with 200,100,0 were solutions is incorrect. There's

---------------

 another solution here. So now I need to explore further.

Wait a second, so (150, 100, 50) works

---------------

. Let me check my previous assumption. So maybe there are more solutions where variables are all different and none are zero. So

---------------

 my earlier approach was incomplete.

Hmm, so I need a better approach here.

Let me think again. Let me note that in

---------------

 the case where variables are 150,100,50, the sum is 300, and the expression

---------------

 is 6,000,000. So that's valid. Let me see if there are permutations of this

---------------

 as well. Since all three numbers are distinct, the number of permutations is 6. So that's 6 solutions.



---------------

Similarly, maybe there are other triples like this. Let me see.

Alternatively, let me consider that in this case, the

---------------

 numbers 150,100,50 can be thought of as multiples of 50. Let me see

---------------

:

150 = 3*50, 100 = 2*50, 50 =1*50. So scaling

---------------

 down by 50, the triple (3,2,1) scaled by 50 gives (150,100,50). Let me check if

---------------

 (3,2,1) scaled by some factor k would give solutions.

Suppose that a = kx, b = ky, c = kz where x,

---------------

 y, z are integers and x + y + z = 300/k. Wait, but scaling complicates things

---------------

. Alternatively, maybe there is a pattern here.

Alternatively, let me think of variables in terms of ratios. Let me suppose

---------------

 that the variables are in arithmetic progression? Let me try.

Suppose a = d - e, b = d, c = d + e, so

---------------

 that they form an arithmetic progression. Then a + b + c = 3d = 300 ⇒ d = 100. So

---------------

 then a = 100 - e, b = 100, c = 100 + e.

Then

---------------

, let me compute the expression a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Pl

---------------

ugging in:

a = 100 - e, b = 100, c = 100 + e

First

---------------

 compute each term:

a²b = (100 - e)^2 * 100

a²c = (100 - e)^2 * (100 + e)

b²a = 100²*(100 - e)

b²c = 100²*(100 + e)

c²a = (100 + e)^2*(100 - e)

c²b = (100 + e)^2 * 100

Adding

---------------

 all terms together:

Let me compute term by term:

First, a²b + c²b = 100*( (100 - e)^2 + (100 + e)^2 )

Similarly, a²c + b²c = (100 + e)*[ (100 - e)^2 + 100² ]

Wait

---------------

, perhaps this is getting too convoluted. Alternatively, maybe compute each term:

Alternatively, let me compute each term step

---------------

 by step.

Compute a²b = (100 - e)^2 * 100

= [100² - 200e + e²] * 100

= 100³

---------------

 - 20,000e + 100e²

a²c = (100 - e)^2*(100 + e) = [

---------------

 (100 - e)^2 ]*(100 + e )

Let me expand (100 - e)^2*(100 + e):

First,

---------------

 (100 - e)^2 = 10,000 - 200e + e²



---------------

Multiply by (100 + e):

= (10,000)(100 + e) - 200e(100 + e) + e²(100 + e)

= 1,000,000 + 10,000e - 20,000e - 200e² + 100e² + e³

=

---------------

 1,000,000 - 10,000e - 100e² + e³

Similarly, b²a = 100²*(100 - e) = 10,000*(100 - e) = 1,000,000 -10,000e

b²c = 10,000*(100 + e) = 1,000,000 +10,000e

c²a = (100 + e)^2*(100 - e)

---------------

 = similar to a²c but with e replaced by -e?

Wait, let me compute:

(100 + e)^2*(100 - e) = [10,000 + 200e + e²]*(100 - e)

=

---------------

 10,000*(100 - e) + 200e*(100 - e) + e²*(100 - e)

= 1,000,000 -10,000e + 20,000e - 200e² + 100e² - e³

= 1,000,000 +10,000e -100e² - e³

c

---------------

²b = (100 + e)^2 *100 = [10,000 + 200e + e²]*100 = 1,000,000 + 20,000e + 100e²

Now, adding

---------------

 all six terms together:

Let me list all terms:

1. a²b: 100³ -20,000e +100e²



---------------

Wait, 100³ is 1,000,000, so:

a²b: 1,000,000 -20,000e +100e²

2. a²c: 1,000,000 -10,000e -100e² + e³

3. b²a: 1,000,000 -10,000e

4. b²c: 1,000,000 +10,000e

5. c²a: 1,000,000 +10,000e -100e² -e³

6. c²b: 1,000,000 +20,000e +100e²

Now let me sum all

---------------

 these terms:

Let's first count the constants (terms without e):

Each of the six terms has 1,000,000 except

---------------

 maybe?

Wait term1: 1,000,000

term2: 1,000,000

term3: 1,000,000

term4: 1,000,000

term5: 1,000,000

term6: 1,000,000

Total constants: 6*

---------------

1,000,000 = 6,000,000

Now the terms with e:

term

---------------

1: -20,000e

term2: -10,000e

term3: -10,000e

term4: +10,000e

term5: +10,000e

term6: +20,000e

Adding these

---------------

:

-20,000e -10,000e -10,000e +10,000e +10,000e +20,000e

Let me compute step by step:

Start with -20,000e -

---------------

10,000e = -30,000e

-30,000e -10,000e = -40,000e

-40,000e +10,000e = -30,000e

-30,000e +10,000e = -20,000e

-20,000e +20,000e = 0.

---------------

 So all the e terms cancel out.

Now terms with e²:

term1: +100e²

term2: -100e²

term3: 0

term4: 0

term5: -100e²

term6: +100e²

Adding these

---------------

:

100e² -100e² -100e² +100e² = (100 -100 -100 +100)e² = 0



---------------

Terms with e³:

term2: +e³

term5: -e³

So total e³ terms: e³ - e³ = 0

Therefore

---------------

, the total sum of all terms is 6,000,000 + 0 + 0 +0 =6,000,000,

---------------

 which is exactly the required value.

Therefore, for any e, as long as a, b, c are nonnegative integers,

---------------

 this holds. Wait, that can't be. Wait, but in the arithmetic progression case, the expression is always equal to 6,000,000?



---------------

Wait, but that's only when variables are in arithmetic progression around 100. Wait, but in this case, a

---------------

 + b + c = 3d = 300 ⇒ d =100. So variables are (100 - e, 100, 100 + e). Therefore

---------------

, for any e where 100 - e ≥0 and 100 + e ≤ 300?

---------------

 Wait, but since a + b + c = 300, the maximum e can be is 100 (

---------------

so that a =0 when e=100, but c=200). Wait, but in this setup

---------------

, e can range from 0 up to 100, because if e >100, then a would

---------------

 be negative. So e can be from 0 to 100 inclusive.

Therefore, for each integer e from 0 to 100, the

---------------

 triple (100 - e, 100, 100 + e) will satisfy both equations.

---------------

 However, we need the variables to be nonnegative integers, so e can be 0 to 100.

But

---------------

 wait, when e=0, that gives (100,100,100), which is the all

---------------

 equal case. When e=100, that gives (0,100,200). Which is one

---------------

 of the earlier cases. Similarly, when e=50, that gives (50,100,150), which is the example

---------------

 I had before. So this shows that all triples where the numbers form an arithmetic progression with common difference 2e (since

---------------

 difference between a and b is e, between b and c is e) around the central term 100 are solutions.

Therefore, the

---------------

 arithmetic progression solutions are parameterized by e from 0 to 100. Each e gives a unique solution (up

---------------

 to ordering). However, the triples (100 - e, 100, 100 + e) are

---------------

 ordered, but actually, the variables can be permuted. Wait, but in this setup, the variables are in a specific order.

---------------

 However, in the problem statement, the triples (a, b, c) are unordered? Wait no, the problem says "triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c)", so ordered

---------------

 triples. Therefore, each permutation is a distinct solution. However, in the arithmetic progression setup, the triples are ordered as (a

---------------

, b, c) = (100 - e, 100, 100 + e). But

---------------

 since the problem allows any ordering, each such arithmetic progression can be arranged in different ways.

Wait, actually, the arithmetic progression case

---------------

 gives specific triples where the numbers are in AP, but since the problem counts ordered triples, each permutation of such a triple is

---------------

 a different solution. Except when all three are equal, which only has one permutation.

Therefore, first, let's consider the

---------------

 case when e =0: (100, 100, 100). Only one ordered triple here.

For e from 1 to 99:

---------------

 each e gives a triple with distinct elements (since 100 - e, 100, 100 + e are distinct when

---------------

 e≠0). The number of ordered permutations for each such triple is 6 (since all three elements are distinct). However

---------------

, the arithmetic progression triple as given (100 - e, 100, 100 + e) is just one specific

---------------

 permutation. So for each e from 1 to 99, there are 6 ordered triples corresponding to the permutations.

Wait

---------------

, but actually, when e is varied, each distinct set {100 - e, 100, 100 + e} corresponds

---------------

 to a unique multiset. However, when e and (100 - e) are considered, they might produce the same multiset?

---------------

 Wait no, because e is from 1 to 100, so for e and (100 - e),

---------------

 the multisets would be different unless e =50. Wait, let me see:

Suppose e=1 and e=99:



---------------

For e=1: the numbers are 99, 100, 101

For e=99: numbers

---------------

 are 1, 100, 199

These are different multisets. So each e from 1 to 100 gives a unique multiset,

---------------

 except when e and (100 - e) might produce same multiset? Wait, no. For example, e=50 gives

---------------

 50,100,150, which is different from e=50's counterpart? Wait,

---------------

 actually, e=50 is in the middle. So each e from 1 to 100 gives a unique multiset.

---------------

 Wait, but when e=50, the multiset is {50,100,150},

---------------

 which is same as e=50, but when e=25, it's {75, 100, 125}, which

---------------

 is different from e=75's {25, 100, 175}. So all are

---------------

 distinct.

Therefore, for e from 1 to 100, each gives a unique multiset. However, when

---------------

 e=100, the multiset is {0,100,200}, which is the same as the

---------------

 case when one variable is zero. Earlier, we had found that (200,100,0) etc

---------------

. are solutions. So this arithmetic progression approach includes those as well.

Therefore, the arithmetic progression approach gives all solutions where the numbers

---------------

 are in an arithmetic progression with common difference 2e, centered at 100. Each such triple (in any order) is

---------------

 a solution. So how many ordered triples does this account for?

First, for e from 0 to 100:

- e=0: (

---------------

100,100,100). Only 1 ordered triple.

- e from 1 to 99: For

---------------

 each e, there are 6 permutations. So total 99*6 = 594.

- e=100: The

---------------

 triple is (0,100,200). The permutations of this are 3! /1! (since all distinct) so

---------------

 6 permutations. Wait but earlier when I considered c=0, I found that (200,100,0) etc. are

---------------

 solutions, which is exactly the case here. So e=100 gives 6 ordered triples.

Therefore total from arithmetic progression approach

---------------

: 1 + 594 + 6 = 601.

Wait, but wait, 1 (for e=0) + 99*6 (for e=1 to 99) + 6 (for e=100) =

---------------

 1 + 594 +6 = 601. Hmm, but let me check e=100:



---------------

Wait, when e=100, the triple is (100 - 100, 100, 100 +100) = (0, 100, 200). So

---------------

 that is one multiset, which has 6 permutations. So that's correct.

So total of 601 ordered triples from arithmetic

---------------

 progression.

But wait, but earlier when I found (150,100,50), which is e

---------------

=50, so that's included in the arithmetic progression case. So that's accounted for.

However, there might be other solutions outside of this

---------------

 arithmetic progression. For example, the case where one variable is zero, but not part of an arithmetic progression?

Wait, no

---------------

, the case where variables are (200,100,0) is part of the arithmetic progression when e=100.

---------------

 So that's included. The other solutions with a zero variable are exactly when e=100. So the arithmetic progression covers

---------------

 all those cases.

Wait, but are there solutions not in arithmetic progression? Let me see.

Suppose we have a triple (

---------------

a,b,c) not in arithmetic progression, but still satisfies the equations. Let me try to find such a triple.

Sup

---------------

pose a=150, b=150, c=0. Wait, we tried this earlier, but

---------------

 the sum was 6,750,000 which was too big. Not a solution.

How about a

---------------

= 120, b= 100, c=80. Let's see.

Check sum: 120+100+80=300. Good.

Compute the expression:

a²b +a²c +b

---------------

²a +b²c +c²a +c²b

Compute term by term:

a²b = 120²*100 = 14,400*100 = 1,440,000

a²c =120²*80 =14,400*80=1,152,000

b²a =100²*120 =10,000*120=1,200,000

b²c =100²*80=8

---------------

00,000

c²a =80²*120=6,400*120=768,000

c²b =80²*100=6,400*100=640,000

Adding

---------------

 all together:

1,440,000 + 1,152,000 = 2,592,000

+1,200,000 → 3,792,000

+800,000 → 4,592,000

+768,000 →5,360,000

+640,000 →6,000,000.

---------------

 Oh! That works too. Wait, so (120,100,80) is another solution,

---------------

 which is not in an arithmetic progression.

Wait, let me check if this is part of the arithmetic progression framework. Let's see:



---------------

Suppose the triple (120,100,80). Let me see if they form an arithmetic progression.

---------------

 The numbers are 80,100,120, which is an arithmetic progression with common difference 20. So

---------------

 yes, it is an arithmetic progression. The common difference here is 20, so the middle term is 100, so

---------------

 e=20. So (100 -20, 100, 100+20)

---------------

 = (80,100,120). Therefore, it is indeed part of the arithmetic progression case. So that

---------------

's accounted for.

Hmm, so perhaps all solutions are indeed covered by the arithmetic progression case. Let me try another triple not

---------------

 in AP.

Suppose (180, 60, 60). Let me check:

Sum: 180+60+60=300.

Compute the expression:

a²b +a²c +b²a +b²c +c²a +c²b

=

---------------

 180²*60 +180²*60 +60²*180 +60²*60 +60²*180 +60²*60

Wait

---------------

, let me compute each term:

a²b = (180)^2 *60 = 32,400 *60 =1,944,000

a²c = same as a²b since

---------------

 c=60: another 1,944,000

b²a = (60)^2 *180 = 3,600 *180 =648,000

b²c = (

---------------

60)^2 *60 = 3,600 *60 =216,000

c²a = same as b²a:

---------------

648,000

c²b = same as b²c:216,000

Total

---------------

 sum:

1,944,000 +1,944,000 =3,888,000

+648,000 →

---------------

4,536,000

+216,000 →4,752,000

+648,000 →5,400,000

+216,000 →5,616,000.

---------------

 Which is less than 6,000,000. So not a solution.

So that's not a solution. Another

---------------

 example: a= 160, b=100, c=40.

Check sum: 160+100+40=300.

Compute expression:

a²b =160²*100 =25,600*100=2,560,000

a²c =160²*40=25,600*40=1,024,000

b²a=100²*160=1,000,000*0.16=

---------------

160,000? Wait, no:

Wait 100² is 10,000.

---------------

 10,000*160 =1,600,000

b²c=100²*40=10,000*40=400,000

c²a=40²*160=1,600*160=256,000

c²b=40²*100=1,600*100=160,000

Total

---------------

:

2,560,000 +1,024,000 =3,584,000

+1,600,000 →5,184,000

+400,000 →5,584,000

+256,000 →5,840,000

+160,000 →6,000,000. Oh

---------------

! That works. So (160,100,40) is another solution. But is this part

---------------

 of the arithmetic progression?

Yes. The numbers 40,100,160 form an arithmetic progression with common difference 60. So e=60,

---------------

 so (100 -60,100,100+60) = (40,100,160). So

---------------

 yes, that is part of the arithmetic progression case.

Therefore, it seems that all solutions are indeed captured by the arithmetic progression approach

---------------

. So the only triples (a, b, c) that satisfy the conditions are those where the numbers form an arithmetic progression centered at 100,

---------------

 with common difference 2e, for e from 0 to 100, and all permutations thereof.

Therefore, the

---------------

 total number of ordered triples is as calculated earlier: 1 (for e=0) + 99*6 (for e=1 to 99) +6 (for e=100) = 1 + 594 +6 = 601.

Wait, but let

---------------

 me confirm with e=50, which gives (50,100,150). The permutations of

---------------

 this are 6, which are all valid. Similarly, e=1 gives (99,100,101), which

---------------

 has 6 permutations, etc. So this seems correct.

However, hold on a second. Let me think about e=100.

---------------

 When e=100, we get (0,100,200). The permutations of this are 

---------------

6, which are all valid. But when e=100, the third term is 200, which

---------------

 is okay as long as the first term is 0, which is allowed.

But wait, when e=100, the

---------------

 first term is 0, which is acceptable because the problem allows nonnegative integers. So that's okay.

Now, but

---------------

 earlier when I considered the case where one variable is zero, I thought of (200,100,0) and

---------------

 permutations, which is exactly this case. So that's included in the arithmetic progression count.

Therefore, all solutions are accounted for in

---------------

 this arithmetic progression approach. Therefore, the total number of ordered triples is 601.

Wait, but let me think

---------------

 again: for e from 0 to 100, inclusive. That's 101 values of e. For

---------------

 each e except e=0 and e=100, the triple has three distinct numbers, so 6 permutations. For e=0, all

---------------

 numbers are same, so only 1 permutation. For e=100, the numbers are 0,100,200,

---------------

 which are distinct, so 6 permutations. Therefore, total number is:

Number of triples when e=0: 1

Number when e=100: 6

Number when e=1 to 99: 

---------------

99 values, each with 6 permutations: 99×6=594

Total: 1+594+6= 601. So

---------------

 that's correct.

However, let me check another example. Let me take e=25, which gives (75,100,125). The

---------------

 permutations of this are 6 ordered triples, which are all distinct and valid. So that's correct.

Therefore, the total number of ordered

---------------

 triples is 601.

Wait, but the problem says "nonnegative integers", so including zero. So I think this is correct. But

---------------

 let me confirm with the earlier examples:

The all-100 triple is counted once.

The triples like (150,100,50) are

---------------

 counted 6 times (all permutations).

Similarly, the (0,100,200) case is counted 6 times.

So

---------------

 total is 601.

Wait, but hold on, 101 values of e (from 0 to 100),

---------------

 each giving some number of ordered triples:

Wait, for e=0: 1 ordered triple.

For e=1 to 99: each gives 6 ordered triples.



---------------

For e=100: 6 ordered triples.

Thus total: 1 + (99×6) +6 = 1 + 594 +6 = 601. So

---------------

 that's the total.

Therefore, the answer should be 601.

Wait, but let me think again if there are

---------------

 any other solutions outside of the arithmetic progression case.

Suppose there is a triple (a, b, c) not in an

---------------

 arithmetic progression. Suppose a, b, c are all different, but not in AP. Let me try to see if such

---------------

 a triple can satisfy the equations.

Let me take a=140, b=100, c=60. Let

---------------

's see:

Sum is 140+100+60=300.

Compute the expression:

a²b =140²×100 =19,600×100=1,960,000

a²c=140²×60=19,600×60=1,176,000

b²a=100²×140=10,000×140=1,400,000

b²c=100²×60=600,000

c²a=60²×140=3,600×140=504,000

c²b=60²×100=360,000

Adding

---------------

 all together:

1,960,000 +1,176,000 =3,136,000

+1,400,000 →4,536,000

+600,000 →5,136,000

+504,000 →5,640,000

+360,000 →6,000,000. Wait

---------------

! That works.

Hmm, so (140,100,60) is a solution. But is

---------------

 this an arithmetic progression?

The numbers 60,100,140 form an arithmetic progression with difference 40. So

---------------

 yes, e=40. Therefore, this is included in the arithmetic progression case.

Therefore, my initial thought that all solutions are arithmetic

---------------

 progressions seems correct.

Another test: Let me try a triple not in AP. Let me pick a=130, b=110, c=60. Sum

---------------

 is 130+110+60=300.

Compute the expression:

a²b =130²×110 =16,900×110=1,859,000

a²c=130²×60=16,900×60=1,014,000

b²a=110²×130=12,100×130=1,573,000

b²c=110²×60=12,100×60=726,000

c²a=60²×130=3,600×130=468,000

c²b=60²×110=3,600×110=396,000

Total

---------------

 sum:

1,859,000 +1,014,000 =2,873,000

+1,573,000 →4,446,000

+726,000 →5,172,000

+468,000 →5,640,000

+396,000 →6,036,000. Which

---------------

 is more than 6,000,000. So not a solution. So that's not valid.

Hmm

---------------

, so this is not a solution. Therefore, only triples in AP work.

Another test: Let me try (10

---------------

0, 150, 50). Wait, that's the same as (50,100,150), which

---------------

 is an AP with e=50. So that's included.

Therefore, I can't find any triples outside of the arithmetic progression case

---------------

 that satisfy the equation, so I think the arithmetic progression case covers all solutions.

Therefore, the total number of triples is 601.

Wait, but hold

---------------

 on, when e ranges from 0 to 100, that's 101 different e values. For

---------------

 each e, the number of ordered triples is as follows:

- For e=0: 1 triple (all 100s)

- For e=1 to 99: each gives

---------------

 6 triples

- For e=100: 6 triples

Total: 1 + 99×6 +6 = 1 + 594 +6 = 601.



---------------

Therefore, the answer is 601.

Wait, but let me check if e can go beyond 100?

---------------

 For example, e=101 would give (100-101,100,100+101)= (-1,100,201),

---------------

 which is invalid because of the negative number. So e can't exceed 100. So e from 0 to 100 inclusive

---------------

 is correct.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is 601.

But wait, the problem says "nonnegative integers", so zero

---------------

 is allowed, but negative numbers are not. So all triples considered are valid as long as each component is nonnegative, which they

---------------

 are for e from 0 to 100.

Therefore, the final answer should be 601. But

---------------

 let me check if there is an alternative way to see this.

Alternatively, the number of triples is equal to the number of arithmetic

---------------

 progressions possible plus permutations.

Alternatively, since the arithmetic progression is determined by e from 0 to 100, and

---------------

 each gives 6 permutations except e=0 and e=100:

Wait, no, e=100 still

---------------

 gives 6 permutations, only e=0 gives 1.

Therefore, the total is indeed 1 + 99×6 +6 =

---------------

 601.

Therefore, I think the answer is 601.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{601}


To solve the problem of finding the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a, b, c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by rewriting

---------------

 the given expression using symmetric sums. 

The expression can be rewritten as:
\[
a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b)
\]
Substituting \(b + c = 300 - a\), \(a + c = 300 - b\), and \(a + b = 300 - c\), we get:
\[
a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000
\]

We also use

---------------

 the identity:
\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc
\]
Given \(a + b + c = 300\), substituting this into the identity gives:
\[
300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000
\]
Dividing by 3:
\[
100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000
\]

We consider the case where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) form an arithmetic progression. Let \(a = 100 - e\), \(b = 100\), and \(c = 100 + e\) for some nonnegative integer \(e\). This setup

---------------

 ensures \(a + b + c = 300\). Substituting these into the equation confirms that the expression equals

---------------

 \(6,000,000\) for any \(e\).

The valid values of \(e\) range from 0 to 100.

---------------

 Each value of \(e\) (except \(e = 0\) and \(e = 100\)) corresponds

---------------

 to a set of three distinct numbers, which can be permuted in 6 ways. The cases \(e = 0\) (all numbers

---------------

 are 100) and \(e = 100\) (numbers are 0, 100, 200) contribute

---------------

 1 and 6 permutations respectively.

Calculating the total number of triples:
- \(e = 0\) contributes 1 triple.
- \(e = 1\) to \(e = 99\) each contribute 6 triples, totaling \(99 \times 6 = 594\).
- \(e = 100\) contributes 6 triples.

Summing these contributions:
\[
1 + 594 + 6 = 601
\]

Thus, the number of triples \((a, b, c)\) is \(\boxed{601}\).<|im_end|>
