Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The question is about finding the sum of the squares of all the items in a list of positive integers with

---------------

 specific conditions. Let me jot down the given information first:

1. The sum of the items is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9. So

---------------

, 9 appears more frequently than any other number.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

Hmm, okay

---------------

. Let's start by recalling some definitions to make sure I'm on the right track.

Mode is the number that appears most often, and since it's unique

---------------

, there's only one mode, which is 9. So, 9 has to occur more times than any other number in the list. The

---------------

 median being a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list is a bit tricky. Let me think about how the list is

---------------

 structured.

First, the list has to be ordered, right? Since median is the middle value. Depending on whether the number of elements is even or odd, the median is

---------------

 either the middle number or the average of the two middle numbers. But the problem says the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So

---------------

, if the median is an average of two numbers, that average must not be an integer unless the two numbers are the same.

---------------

 Wait, but if the average is an integer, then those two numbers must be equal. But if they are equal, then that number would be part

---------------

 of the list, so the median would actually be that number, which is in the list. Therefore, the median must be an

---------------

 integer that isn't present in the list. Therefore, the list must have an odd number of elements so that the median is exactly

---------------

 the middle number. Wait, no. Wait, let's think again.

Wait, the median can be an integer even if the list

---------------

 has an even number of elements, but only if the two middle numbers are the same. But in that case, the median would equal that

---------------

 number, which is present in the list. Therefore, the only way for the median not to be in the list is if the list has an odd number of elements,

---------------

 so the median is the exact middle number. Wait, but if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle number

---------------

, so that number must be in the list. Wait, that contradicts the problem's third condition. Wait, hold on,

---------------

 that can't be.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the third condition: "The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself." So

---------------

 the median is an integer, but that integer is not present in the list. Therefore, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element, which must

---------------

 be an element of the list. Therefore, that can't be. Therefore, the list must have an even number of elements.

---------------

 Because in that case, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, and if that average is an integer not in the list, then the

---------------

 two middle numbers must be two different numbers whose average is an integer not in the list. Let me see.

Wait, let

---------------

's clarify this again. Suppose the list has an even number of elements, say 2n elements. Then the median is the average of the nth and (n+1)th elements. For

---------------

 the median to be an integer not in the list, the average of those two must be an integer, which requires that the

---------------

 two numbers are either both integers and their sum is even (so they are both even or both odd). Moreover, that average must not be present

---------------

 anywhere in the list. 

Alternatively, if the list has an odd number of elements, then the median is the exact middle element

---------------

, which must be present in the list. Since the problem states that the median does not appear in the list, that's

---------------

 impossible. Therefore, the list must have an even number of elements. So, the list must be of even length. Got

---------------

 it. So that's an important point.

Therefore, the list has an even number of elements. Let me note that down

---------------

.

Also, the mode is 9, which is unique. Therefore, 9 must occur more times than any other number. Let

---------------

's denote the number of times 9 appears as m, and all other numbers can appear at most m-1 times.

Now

---------------

, the total sum is 30, so all numbers in the list add up to 30.

Hmm, okay

---------------

. Let's try to structure the list. Let me think of possible scenarios.

First, let's consider possible lengths for the list. Since the median

---------------

 is the average of the two middle numbers, and the list has an even number of elements, let's denote the number of elements as 2k.

---------------

 So, the median is the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th terms. Let me think of possible

---------------

 k values. Since the sum is 30, the list can't be too long. Let's see:

If the list has 

---------------

2 elements, the median would be the average of the two numbers. But since they are both in the list, the average would

---------------

 have to be an integer not in the list. But if the two numbers are, say, a and b, then (

---------------

a + b)/2 must not be equal to a or b, so a ≠ b. But since the mode is 9, which

---------------

 must be the most frequent. If there are two elements, then both would have to be 9, but then the median

---------------

 would be 9, which is in the list. That's invalid. So 2 elements can't work.

Next, 

---------------

4 elements. Let's see if that's possible. Let's try with 4 elements.

Suppose the list has 4 numbers. Let

---------------

 me think:

The median is the average of the second and third numbers. Let's denote the numbers in order as a, b, c, d. The

---------------

 median is (b + c)/2. This must be an integer not in the list. The mode is 9, so 9 must appear more than any other number. Let

---------------

's see.

Suppose 9 appears twice. Then other numbers can appear at most once. Let's see.

Let me try

---------------

 to construct such a list. Let me suppose the two middle numbers (positions 2 and 3) must average to an integer not in the list.

Sup

---------------

pose the list is [x, y, z, w], sorted in non-decreasing order.

Wait, let me think

---------------

 of possible elements. Let's say 9 is the mode. So, 9 must occur at least twice. Let's try

---------------

 9 appearing twice. Let me see.

Suppose the list has two 9s. Then the other two numbers must

---------------

 be different or same, but can't be 9. But since 9 is the unique mode, they can't have

---------------

 another number appearing twice. So the other two numbers can be at most once each.

Wait, but if we have two 9s and two other numbers each

---------------

 appearing once, then the mode is 9 (since it appears twice, others once). That works. Let me try to

---------------

 make such a list.

Suppose the numbers are [a, 9, 9, b], where a ≤ 9 and b ≥9.

---------------

 The median is (9 +9)/2 = 9, but 9 is in the list, so that's invalid

---------------

. So the median must not be 9. Hmm. So, maybe the two middle numbers are not both 9.

---------------

 Let me try.

Suppose the two 9s are not in the middle. Let me think of a list like [x

---------------

, y, 9, 9]. Then the median is (y +9)/2. To have the median not be

---------------

 an element of the list. Let me suppose that (y +9)/2 is an integer not in the list.

Also

---------------

, the total sum is 30. So x + y + 9 +9 = 30 → x + y = 12.

Since

---------------

 the list is sorted, x ≤ y ≤9 ≤9. Wait, but since the list is in non-decreasing order, the

---------------

 first two numbers must be less than or equal to 9. Wait, but the last two are 9 and 9.

---------------

 So, the first two numbers are x and y, which are ≤9.

The median is (y +9)/2.

---------------

 Let that median be an integer not in the list. Let me try possible values.

Suppose x and y are such that their

---------------

 sum with 18 (the two 9s) is 30, so x + y =12. Let

---------------

 me see possible pairs for x and y where x ≤ y ≤9, and x + y =12.

Possible pairs (

---------------

x,y):

Possible since x ≤ y ≤9, so y can be at most 9, so x would be 12 - y.

---------------

 So possible pairs:

(3,9), (4,8), (5,7), (6,6).

Wait,

---------------

 but if x and y are 6 and 6, then the list is [6,6,9,9]. Then

---------------

 the median is (6 +9)/2 = 7.5, which is not an integer. So that's invalid

---------------

. We need the median to be an integer.

So, let's check other pairs:

First pair: (3,9).

---------------

 Then the list is [3,9,9,9]. Wait, but that would have three 9s. Wait, but

---------------

 the original assumption was that the list has two 9s. Wait, no. Wait in the example I thought of [

---------------

x,y,9,9], but if y is 9, then the third element is 9, so actually the

---------------

 list would be [3,9,9,9], but that's 4 elements? Wait no, no. Wait,

---------------

 the list length is 4, so if we have [3,9,9,9], that's 4 elements?

---------------

 No, 3 elements? Wait, no. Wait, maybe I messed up the order.

Wait, if the list is [3,9,9,9], that's four elements?

---------------

 No, 3,9,9,9 is four elements. But in that case, the two middle numbers are the second and third,

---------------

 which are both 9. The median is 9, which is in the list. Not allowed. So that's bad

---------------

.

Wait, perhaps I need to have y less than 9. Let me see. Let's take the pair (4,8). Then the list would be [4,8,9,9]. The

---------------

 median is (8 +9)/2 = 8.5, which is not an integer. Not valid.

Next pair (

---------------

5,7). Then the list is [5,7,9,9]. The median is (7 +9)/2 = 8. The

---------------

 median is 8, which is not in the list? The list is [5,7,9,9]. 

---------------

8 is not in the list, so that works. Okay, so that could be a possibility. Let me check:

Sum

---------------

 is 5 +7 +9 +9 = 30? 5+7=12, 9+9=18, total 30. Yes

---------------

. The mode is 9 (appears twice, others once or twice? Wait, 5 and 7 appear once,

---------------

 9 appears twice. So mode is 9, which is unique. Okay. The median is 8, which is not in the list. That

---------------

 seems to satisfy all conditions. Hmm. So this could be a possible list.

Alternatively, let me check the next pair (

---------------

6,6). The list would be [6,6,9,9]. The median is (6 +9)/2 = 7.5, not integer. So invalid

---------------

. So the only valid possibility here is [5,7,9,9].

Wait, but hold on, the problem

---------------

 says "the unique mode of the list is 9". In the list [5,7,9,9], 9 occurs twice, and

---------------

 5 and 7 occur once. So yes, mode is 9, unique. That's good. The median is 8, which is not in the list. The

---------------

 sum is 30. So this list satisfies all conditions. Okay, that seems like a candidate.

But before concluding, let

---------------

's check if there are other possibilities with different numbers of elements. Maybe the list has 6 elements? Let me see.



---------------

Suppose the list has 6 elements. Then the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th elements. Let me see

---------------

 if that can also work.

Let me denote the elements as a, b, c, d, e, f, in

---------------

 non-decreasing order. The median is (c + d)/2, which must be an integer not in the list. The sum is

---------------

 30, mode is 9 (appears more than any other number).

Let's see. Since mode is 9, 

---------------

9 has to appear at least twice, and more than any other number. Let's suppose 9 appears three times. Let

---------------

 me try:

Suppose three 9s. Then the other three numbers must each appear at most twice, but since the

---------------

 mode is unique, they can appear at most two times. Wait, but if another number appears twice, that's okay as long as it's less than three. Hmm

---------------

.

Let me try constructing such a list. Let's say the list has three 9s. Then, the remaining three numbers have

---------------

 to add up to 30 - 27 = 3. So, three numbers adding up to 3. Since they are positive integers, the

---------------

 only way is 1,1,1. But then 1 appears three times, same as 9. But the

---------------

 mode must be unique. Therefore that's invalid. So can't have three 9s with other numbers being 1,

---------------

1,1.

Alternatively, maybe two other numbers. Wait, three numbers adding to 3. So possible options: 1,1,1 (

---------------

but that's three 1s, which would tie with 9's three occurrences, so mode wouldn't be unique).

---------------

 Alternatively, 1,1, and 1. So no, that's same. So that's not possible. Therefore

---------------

, if we have three 9s, it's impossible because the remaining numbers can't be arranged without another mode. Therefore

---------------

, maybe 9 appears twice. Wait, but then other numbers can appear at most once, so maybe?

Wait, let

---------------

 me think again. If the list has six elements, and the mode is 9. To make 9 the unique mode, it needs

---------------

 to appear more than any other number. If it appears twice, then other numbers can appear at most once. But then total

---------------

 elements would be 2 (for 9) plus four other distinct numbers, but sum would be 9*2 + sum of others

---------------

 = 18 + sum(others) =30, so sum of others is 12. But with four distinct numbers each

---------------

 at least 1, but arranged in order.

Wait, but maybe they can repeat? Wait no, because if they repeat

---------------

, then their count would be more. Let me see:

Suppose 9 appears twice. Then the remaining four numbers can each

---------------

 be at most once. Wait, but four numbers, each appearing once. So total numbers would be 2 +4 =6.

---------------

 The sum of those four numbers must be 12. Let me see if such a list can be constructed where the median (

---------------

average of 3rd and 4th terms) is an integer not in the list.

Let me try. Let's

---------------

 arrange the numbers in non-decreasing order. Let the list be [a, b, c, d, 9, 9]. Wait

---------------

, but since there are two 9s, maybe they are at the end. Let me see:

Wait, if there

---------------

 are two 9s, the other four numbers are all less than or equal to 9. Wait, but they can

---------------

 be anything as long as they are positive integers. Let me try to make the median (average of third and fourth terms) an

---------------

 integer not in the list.

Suppose the four non-9 numbers add up to 12, and are arranged in

---------------

 order. Let me try some numbers.

Suppose the first four numbers are 1, 2, 3, 6. Then

---------------

 sorted list would be [1,2,3,6,9,9]. The median is (3 +6)/2 = 4.5, which isn't integer. Not good.

Another try

---------------

: Let me try numbers adding to 12. Maybe 2,3,4,3? Wait, but duplicates

---------------

 would cause another mode. Since 3 appears twice, but 9 appears twice as well. Then mode isn't unique. So

---------------

 that's invalid.

Alternatively, 1,2,4,5. Sum is 12. The list is [1,2,4,5,9,9]. The median is (4 +5)/2 = 4.5.

---------------

 Not integer.

Hmm, 1,3,4,4: but 4 appears twice. So modes would be 4 and 9 each

---------------

 appearing twice. Not unique.

Alternatively, maybe 3,3,3,3. But that's four 3s,

---------------

 which would be more than the two 9s. So mode would be 3, which is bad.

Hmm, tricky

---------------

. Let me think of numbers that add to 12 with four distinct numbers so that their third and fourth numbers average to an integer not in the list. Let me try

---------------

 2,3,4,3. Wait, duplicates again.

Alternatively, maybe 0 isn't allowed since they are

---------------

 positive integers. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps 2,2,4,4. Then sum is 12. The

---------------

 list would be [2,2,4,4,9,9]. Then the median is (4 +4)/2=4. The

---------------

 median is 4, which is in the list (since 4 appears twice). So that's invalid.

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 1,1,5,5: sum is 12. The list is [1,1,5,5,9,9]. Median is (5 +5)/2 =5. But

---------------

 5 is in the list, so invalid.

Alternatively, 1,2,2,7: sum is 12. The

---------------

 list would be [1,2,2,7,9,9]. The median is (2 +7)/2 =4.5,

---------------

 not integer.

Hmm, this is getting frustrating. Maybe a six-element list isn't possible? Let me try another approach.

Sup

---------------

pose the two middle numbers (third and fourth) need to average to an integer not in the list. Let that integer be M

---------------

. So M = (c + d)/2, so c + d = 2M, and M is not in

---------------

 the list. Also, since the list is sorted, c ≤ d, so c ≤ M ≤ d. Since M isn

---------------

't in the list, neither c nor d can be equal to M. Since c and d are integers, their average M

---------------

 must be an integer, so c and d must be both even or both odd. 

Also, the total sum of all numbers is 30. Let

---------------

's see, the two 9s contribute 18, so the first four numbers (the first four elements) must

---------------

 add up to 12. Wait, no, in the six-element list, the 9s are the fifth and sixth elements,

---------------

 so the first four elements add to 12. Hmm. Let me think of c and d as the third and fourth elements. So

---------------

 the third and fourth elements must add to 2M. Let me pick an M not present in the list. Let's try

---------------

 M=5. Then c + d=10. The third and fourth elements are c and d, with c ≤ d,

---------------

 and their sum 10. Also, since the list is sorted, the third element is at least the second, and

---------------

 so on. 

Suppose M=5, so c + d =10, and 5 is not in the list. So

---------------

 in the list, the elements must not have a 5. Let me see. Let me pick c and d such that their

---------------

 sum is 10 and neither is 5. For instance, c=4 and d=6. Then the third

---------------

 and fourth elements are 4 and 6. So the list would be [a, b,4,6,9,9]. The first

---------------

 two elements a and b must be ≤4, and their sum plus 4 +6 +9+9=30?

---------------

 Wait, total sum is a + b +4 +6 +9+9 = a + b +28 =30 →

---------------

 a + b =2. Since they are positive integers, a and b can be 1 and 1. So the list would be [1,1,4,6,9,9]. Let

---------------

 me check:

- Mode is 9 (two times), and 1 appears twice as well. Wait, so 1 and 9 both appear

---------------

 twice. That would make the modes both 1 and 9, which violates the unique mode condition. So that's bad

---------------

.

Hmm. Let me try another pair for c and d. Let's say c=3 and d=7. Then

---------------

 M=5. But then d=7, so the fourth element is 7, which must be ≤9, okay

---------------

. Then the list would be [a, b,3,7,9,9]. The first two elements a and b must be

---------------

 ≤3, and their sum is 30 - (3 +7 +9+9) = 30 -28=2. So again a

---------------

 and b must be 1 and1. Then the list is [1,1,3,7,9,9]. Now

---------------

, the modes are 1 (twice) and 9 (twice). So again, two modes. Not unique

---------------

.

Hmm. What if c=2 and d=8? Then M=5. Then the list would be [a, b,2,8,9,9]. The

---------------

 sum of a and b is 30 - (2+8+9+9)=30-28=2 again

---------------

. So a and b must be 1 and1. Then the list is [1,1,2,8,9,9]. Now

---------------

, modes are 1 (twice) and 9 (twice). Still two modes. Not good.

Hmm, maybe

---------------

 M=6. Let me try that. Then c + d =12. Let's choose c and d such that neither

---------------

 is 6. For example, c=5 and d=7. Then M=6. The list would be [a, b,5,7,9,9]. The

---------------

 first two elements a and b must sum to 30 - (5+7+9+9)=30-30=0, but they have

---------------

 to be positive integers. Not possible. 

Alternatively, c=4 and d=8. Then M=6. The

---------------

 list is [a, b,4,8,9,9]. The sum of a and b must be 30 - (4+8+9+9)=30-30=0 again

---------------

. Not possible.

Hmm, maybe M=4. Then c + d =8. Let me pick c=3 and d=5. Then

---------------

 M=4. The list would be [a, b,3,5,9,9]. Sum of a and b:

---------------

 30 - (3+5+9+9)=30-26=4. So a and b can

---------------

 be 1 and 3, but since they must be ≤3 (since the third element is 3), so a

---------------

 ≤ b ≤3. So possible pairs (1,3), (2,2). 

If a=1, b=3, the

---------------

 list is [1,3,3,5,9,9]. Wait, but then the third element is 3, so

---------------

 the list would be [1,3,3,5,9,9]. Now, the modes are 3 (twice) and 9 (twice). Not

---------------

 unique.

If a and b are 2 and2, then the list is [2,2,3,5,9,9]. The

---------------

 modes are 2 (twice) and 9 (twice). Again, two modes. Not good.

Hmm, this

---------------

 is tough. Let me try M=7. Then c + d=14. Let's see, possible c and d could

---------------

 be 7 and7, but then M=7 would be in the list. Not allowed. Alternatively, 6 and8:

---------------

 sum 14. Then M=7. The list would be [a, b,6,8,9,9]. The

---------------

 sum of a and b must be 30 - (6+8+9+9)=30-32= -2. Not

---------------

 possible.

Hmm, maybe M=3. Then c +d=6. Let's try c=2 and d=4. Then

---------------

 M=3. The list is [a, b,2,4,9,9]. The sum of a and b is

---------------

 30 - (2+4+9+9)=30-24=6. So a and b can

---------------

 be, say, 1 and5? But they must be ≤2. Wait, since the third element is 2, so

---------------

 a ≤ b ≤2. So a and b must be 1 and1, 1 and2, or 2 and2.

If

---------------

 a=1, b=1: sum is 2. Not enough. Need sum 6. Not possible. So

---------------

 no solution here.

Hmm. Maybe a six-element list isn't possible. Let me try eight elements? Maybe the list has

---------------

 eight elements. Let's see.

Wait, but maybe I should check if the four-element list I found earlier is the only possible

---------------

 one. Let me go back to that. The four-element list [5,7,9,9] works. Let

---------------

 me confirm again:

- Sum: 5+7+9+9=30. Correct.

- Mode is 9 (appears twice, others once). Unique

---------------

 mode. Good.

- The median is (7 +9)/2 =8, which is not in the list. Perfect. 



---------------

So that works. But maybe there are other four-element lists? Let me see.

Suppose the two 9s are not

---------------

 the last two elements. For example, maybe arranged as [5,9,9,7]. Wait, but sorted order

---------------

 would be [5,7,9,9], which is the same as before. So that's the same list. 



---------------

Alternatively, could there be another four-element list with different numbers?

Suppose instead of 5 and7, maybe different numbers.

---------------

 Let me see. Let me think of other pairs where x + y =12 (since 30 - 9*2 =12)

---------------

 and the median (y +9)/2 is an integer not in the list.

Wait, in the four-element case, the two

---------------

 middle numbers are the second and third elements. So in the list [x,y,9,9], the median is (y +9)/2. To

---------------

 get an integer median, (y +9) must be even, so y must be odd. Since y ≤9,

---------------

 and x ≤ y.

So y can be 1,3,5,7,9. But y has to be such

---------------

 that (y +9)/2 is not in the list.

Let me check all possibilities for y:

Case 1: y=1.

---------------

 Then the list is [x,1,9,9]. Wait, but x ≤1, so x=1. Then

---------------

 the list is [1,1,9,9]. The median is (1 +9)/2=5. 

---------------

5 is not in the list. But the mode is 1 and 9 each twice. Not unique. So invalid.

Case 2: y=3. Then x

---------------

 +3 =12? Wait, x + y =12? Wait, no. Wait in the four-element case, the

---------------

 first two numbers x and y must sum to 12? Wait, no, the total sum is 30. The

---------------

 two 9s contribute 18, so the first two numbers must add up to 12. So x + y =12.

---------------

 If y=3, then x=9. But then x can't be greater than y. Since the list is sorted, x ≤ y. So

---------------

 that can't happen. So y can't be 3 here.

Wait, hold on. Let me clarify again:

In

---------------

 the four-element list [x, y,9,9], the first two elements must be less than or equal to 9.

---------------

 The sum of all four elements is 30, so x + y +9 +9 =30 ⇒ x + y =12. Since the

---------------

 list is in non-decreasing order, x ≤ y ≤9. So x can be at most y, and y can

---------------

 be at most9.

Thus, possible pairs (x,y) must satisfy x ≤ y ≤9 and x + y=12.

So

---------------

 possible y values can be from max(ceil(12/2), ...) Wait, let's see:

To have x ≤ y,

---------------

 then y must be at least 6 (since 6 +6=12). Because if y is less than 6, then

---------------

 x would have to be more than y to sum to 12, which contradicts x ≤ y. Therefore, y

---------------

 can be from 6 to9, but with x =12 - y ≤ y.

So possible y:

y=6 ⇒

---------------

x=6. Then the list is [6,6,9,9]. Median is (6+9)/2=7.5,

---------------

 not integer.

y=7 ⇒x=5. So [5,7,9,9]. Which is the one

---------------

 we had before. The median is (7+9)/2=8, not in the list. Good.

y=8 ⇒x=4. So

---------------

 [4,8,9,9]. The median is (8+9)/2=8.5, not integer.

y=9 ⇒x=3. So

---------------

 [3,9,9,9]. The median is (9+9)/2=9, which is in the list. Not

---------------

 allowed.

Therefore the only valid four-element list is [5,7,9,9].

Alternatively, is there a six

---------------

-element list that works? Let me think again. Maybe I was too hasty before.

Suppose the list has six elements with

---------------

 three 9s. Wait, earlier problem was that the remaining three numbers sum to 3, but that led to three 1s,

---------------

 which would tie the mode. But what if the remaining three numbers are arranged with some duplicates but less than three?

Wait, if

---------------

 we have three 9s, then the other three numbers must add to 3. The only way with positive integers is three 1s. But

---------------

 then 1 appears three times, same as 9. So mode isn't unique. So that's invalid.

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 two 9s and four other numbers. Let me see:

Suppose the list has two 9s. Then the

---------------

 remaining four numbers must add to 12. Let me try to have those four numbers such that none of them repeats more than once (

---------------

so that 9 is the mode). Wait, but four numbers adding to 12 with each at most once. That

---------------

 would require four distinct numbers. Let me see.

Possible combinations of four distinct numbers adding to 12. Let's see

---------------

:

Start with the smallest possible numbers:

1 +2 +3 +6 =12 → sum is 12. So

---------------

 the list would be [1,2,3,6,9,9]. The median is (3 +6)/2 =4.5.

---------------

 Not integer.

Another combination: 1+2+4+5=12. Then the list is [1,2,4,5,9,9]. Median is (4+5)/2=4.5.

---------------

 Not integer.

Hmm. Another combination: 2+3+4+3=12 but duplicates. Not allowed if

---------------

 we want to have other numbers appearing only once.

Alternatively, maybe allowing some duplicates but ensuring that no number except 9 has

---------------

 two duplicates. Wait, if another number appears twice, then since 9 appears twice, that would make two modes. So

---------------

 can't have that. So all other numbers must appear once. So four distinct numbers. Then the median is between the third and fourth elements

---------------

. To get an integer, the two middle numbers must add to an even number.

Looking at the first combination [1,2,3,6],

---------------

 sorted, so third and fourth elements are 3 and6. Their sum is 9, which is odd. So median

---------------

 4.5. Not integer.

Second combination [1,2,4,5], sum third and fourth:4+5=9.

---------------

 Again odd.

Another combination: 1+3+4+4=12, but duplicates. 4 appears twice. Then

---------------

 modes would be 4 and9, each twice. Not unique.

Alternatively, 2+2+3+5=12. Then

---------------

 2 appears twice. So modes 2 and9. Not unique.

Hmm. How about 1+2+5+4?

---------------

 Same as before.

Alternatively, 1+3+3+5=12. Then 3 appears twice. Modes

---------------

 3 and9.

Hmm, this seems impossible. Maybe a different approach.

Suppose the two middle numbers (third and fourth) add

---------------

 to an even number. Let's set their sum as 2M, where M is an integer not in the list.

Let

---------------

 me try to set M=5. Then third and fourth elements add to 10. Let me have them as 4 and6. So

---------------

 the list would be [a,b,4,6,9,9]. The first two elements a and b must add

---------------

 to 30 - (4+6+9+9) = 2. So a=1, b=1. Then

---------------

 the list is [1,1,4,6,9,9]. But then 1 appears twice, same as 9. Not

---------------

 unique mode.

Alternatively, set third and fourth as 3 and7 (sum 10). Then the list is [a,b,3,7,9,9]. a

---------------

 +b= 30 - (3+7+9+9)=2 → a=1, b=1. Same

---------------

 problem.

Hmm. Let me try M=6. Then third and fourth elements add to 12. Let me choose

---------------

 5 and7 (sum 12). Then the list is [a,b,5,7,9,9]. a

---------------

 +b=30 - (5+7+9+9)=0. Not possible.

Alternatively, 4 and8.

---------------

 Then a +b=30 - (4+8+9+9)=0. No.

Hmm. Maybe M=4. Then

---------------

 third and fourth add to 8. Let's say 3 and5. Then list is [a,b,3,5,9,9]. a +b=30 - (3+5+9+9)=4. So a and b can

---------------

 be 1 and3, but since they must be ≤3, possible (1,3). Then list [1,3,3,5,9,9]. But

---------------

 then 3 appears twice, same as 9. Not unique.

Alternatively, a=2 and b=2. Then

---------------

 [2,2,3,5,9,9]. Then modes 2 and9.

Hmm. Not working.

Alternatively

---------------

, third and fourth as 2 and6 (sum 8). Then list [a,b,2,6,9,9]. a +b=30 - (2+6+9+9)=4. So

---------------

 a and b can be 1 and3 (but must be ≤2). So 1 and1: [1,1,2,6,9,9]. Modes

---------------

 1 and9 again.

Hmm. I'm starting to think that maybe a six-element list isn't possible. Let me try

---------------

 an eight-element list just in case.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. The four-element list works.

---------------

 Maybe that's the only one. Let me check the problem again. The problem says "a list of positive integers" without

---------------

 specifying the length, so there might be multiple lists, but perhaps the sum of squares is the same for all possible lists.

---------------

 Let me see.

In the four-element list [5,7,9,9], the sum of squares is 5² +7² +9² +9² =25 +49 +81 +81 =

---------------

 25+49=74; 74+81=155; 155+81=236. So

---------------

 236.

Wait, but maybe there are other lists with different numbers?

Wait, let's see if there's

---------------

 a two-element list. Wait, no, because earlier reasoning said two elements would require both being 15 (since sum 30),

---------------

 but then the median is 15, which is in the list. Also, mode would be 15, but since

---------------

 it's two elements, both 15, so okay, but the median is 15, which is in the list. So

---------------

 invalid.

Three elements? Wait, but three is odd, so the median would be the second element, which has to be in the list. So

---------------

 can't satisfy third condition. So only even numbers of elements.

Wait, maybe a list with six elements where the mode is 9 but

---------------

 with three 9s. Wait, but earlier problem was that the remaining numbers would have to add to 3, leading

---------------

 to three 1s. But what if they are arranged differently?

Suppose three 9s and three 1s. The

---------------

 list would be [1,1,1,9,9,9]. The mode is both 1 and9, so

---------------

 not unique. So invalid.

Alternatively, three 9s, one 2, and two 0s? No, zeros

---------------

 aren't allowed.

Hmm. So maybe the only possible list is the four-element one. Let me see if there's another four-element list.



---------------

Wait, in the four-element case, when y=7 and x=5, we have [5,7,9,9]. Are

---------------

 there other y values?

Earlier, when y=6, x=6 gives [6,6,9,9], median

---------------

 7.5 invalid. y=8 gives x=4, leading to [4,8,9,9], median 8.5 invalid

---------------

. y=9 gives [3,9,9,9], median 9 invalid. So only one possible four-element list.

Therefore

---------------

, maybe that's the only possible list. Therefore, the sum of squares is 236. Wait, let me rec

---------------

alculate that:

5² is 25, 7² is 49, 9² is 81, and

---------------

 another 9² is 81. So adding them up: 25 +49 =74; 74 +81 =155; 155 +81 =236. Yes

---------------

.

Wait, but let me check again if there's another possible list with more elements. Let's try eight elements. Maybe

---------------

?

Suppose eight elements. Then median is average of 4th and 5th elements. Let me try.

Sup

---------------

pose the list has four 9s. Then the remaining four numbers must add to 30 - 4*9 = 30 -36 = negative. Not possible. So too

---------------

 many 9s.

Three 9s: remaining five numbers sum to 30 -27=3. Not

---------------

 possible with five positive integers (minimum sum 5). So invalid.

Two 9s: remaining six numbers sum to 12. Let

---------------

 me see.

To make the mode 9 (appearing twice), the other numbers can appear at most once. So all

---------------

 other numbers must be distinct? Or can some be duplicated as long as they don't reach two?

Wait, since mode is 9 with

---------------

 two occurrences, other numbers can be at most once. So all other numbers must be distinct and appear once. So six distinct numbers adding to 12.

---------------

 The minimum sum of six distinct positive integers is 1+2+3+4+5+6=21, which is way over 12. So

---------------

 impossible.

Hmm. So eight elements also impossible.

How about a 10-element list? Even more 9s would

---------------

 make the total sum too big. Probably not.

Therefore, the only possible list is the four-element one. So the answer should

---------------

 be 236.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The problem says "the unique mode of the list is 9". In the four-element list [5,7,9,9], 9 occurs twice, others

---------------

 once. So that's okay. The median is 8, which isn't in the list. Sum is 30. That

---------------

 works.

Alternatively, is there another four-element list where the two non-9s add to 12 but arranged differently?



---------------

Wait, for instance, if we have [6,6,9,9], but that gives a median of 7.5 which

---------------

 is not integer. So no. The only valid one is [5,7,9,9].

Alternatively, maybe a

---------------

 different arrangement where the two non-9s are different numbers but add to 12. Let me see:

Suppose the

---------------

 numbers are [a,b,9,9], with a +b =12, and the median (b +9)/2 must

---------------

 be an integer not in the list.

Wait, in this arrangement, the list is sorted, so a ≤ b ≤9.



---------------

Wait, in the four-element list, the two middle numbers are b and9, so median is (b +9)/2. To

---------------

 make that an integer, (b+9) must be even ⇒ b is odd. So b must be odd and ≤

---------------

9. Also, the median (b+9)/2 must not be in the list. Let me see:

Possible b values

---------------

 (odd numbers between a and9, with a =12 -b, and a ≤ b):

So b must be at

---------------

 least 6 (since a =12 -b must be ≤b ⇒12 -b ≤b ⇒12 ≤2b ⇒b ≥6). But

---------------

 since b must be odd and ≥6, possible b is 7 or9.

If b=7: then a=5, so

---------------

 the list is [5,7,9,9]. The median is (7+9)/2=8, not in the list. Good

---------------

.

If b=9: then a=3. The list is [3,9,9,9]. The median is (9+9)/2=9, which is in the list. Not

---------------

 allowed.

Next possible odd b is 5? Let's see. If b=5, then a=7, but that

---------------

 would require a ≤b ⇒7 ≤5, which is false. So no. So only b=7 works here.

Therefore

---------------

, indeed only one possible list.

Therefore, the sum of squares is 236. Wait, but let me check

---------------

 once again. 5² is 25, 7² is 49, 9² is 81,

---------------

 another 9² is 81. So total is 25 +49 =74, plus 81 is

---------------

 155, plus another 81 is 236. So yeah, that's correct.

Hmm, but

---------------

 I wonder if there's a six-element list I missed. Let me try once more.

Suppose we have two 9s and

---------------

 four other numbers. Let me think of the four numbers as 1,1,5,5. Then sum is 1+1+5+5=

---------------

12. The list would be [1,1,5,5,9,9]. The median is (5+5)/2=5. But

---------------

 5 is in the list. Not allowed.

Alternatively, numbers like 1,2,3,6. The list [

---------------

1,2,3,6,9,9]. The median is (3+6)/2=4.5,

---------------

 not integer.

Alternatively, 2,2,4,4. Sum is 12. The list [2,2,4,4,9,9]. The median is (4+4)/2=4. Which

---------------

 is present in the list. Not allowed.

Hmm. Another idea: what if the two middle numbers are 8 and 

---------------

8? But then they would have to add to 16, so the median is 8. To have 8 not in the list, but

---------------

 8 would be the middle numbers, so they would be in the list. Not allowed.

Alternatively, middle numbers 7 and9.

---------------

 Wait, but that would give median 8. Let me see. Let's have the list [a,b,7,9,9, c

---------------

]. Wait, no, arranging properly.

Wait, let me think of a list where the third and fourth elements are 7 and9. Then

---------------

 their average is 8, which is not in the list. Let me try:

Suppose the list is [1, 

---------------

3,7,9,9, 10]. Wait, but then the sum is 1+3+7+9+9+10 = 39, which is over 30. Not

---------------

 good.

Alternatively, [1, 2,7,9,9, 2]. But duplicates: 2 appears twice, 

---------------

9 appears twice. Modes would be 2 and9. Not unique.

Hmm. Alternatively, [x, y,7,9,9, z], but

---------------

 need the numbers to be sorted. Let me try to make the first four numbers sum to 12 (since two 9s contribute

---------------

 18, total sum needed 30 ⇒ first four numbers sum to 12). Let me have the third

---------------

 and fourth numbers as7 and5. Wait, but sorted order requires the fourth number to be at least the third. So

---------------

 let me try:

Suppose the four non-9 numbers are 1,3,5,3. But duplicates again

---------------

. Not good.

Alternatively, 1,2,4,5. Sum is 12. The list would be [1,2,4,5,9,9]. The

---------------

 median is (4+5)/2=4.5, not integer.

Hmm. I can't find any other list

---------------

. Therefore, I think the only possible list is the four-element one with sum of squares 236. Therefore, the answer should be 236.



---------------

Wait, but let me check one last thing. The problem says "the median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself".

---------------

 In the four-element case, the median is 8, which isn't in the list. So that's good.

Alternatively

---------------

, is there a list with more elements where the median is an integer not present?

Wait, let me consider a list with six

---------------

 elements where the two middle numbers average to an integer not in the list. Let me try another approach.

Suppose the two

---------------

 middle numbers are 8 and 8, but then the median would be 8, which would be in the list.

---------------

 Not allowed.

What about 7 and9? Their average is 8, which is not in the list. Let's try

---------------

 to make such a list. Let me see:

Suppose the third and fourth elements are7 and9. Then the median

---------------

 is8. So the list is [a, b,7,9,9, c]. Wait, but the total

---------------

 elements must be six. Let's structure it properly.

Wait, the list must be in non-decreasing order. So:



---------------

Let the six elements be [a, b, c, d, e, f], sorted. Then the median is (c + d)/2 =

---------------

8. So c + d =16. And 8 must not be in the list.

Also, the total sum is 

---------------

30. The two 9s are at the end? Let me assume e and f are 9. Then:



---------------

a + b + c + d +9 +9 =30 ⇒ a + b + c + d =12. But

---------------

 c + d =16. Wait, that would require a + b =12 -16= -4. Not

---------------

 possible. So that can't be.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the two 9s are not at the end. Let

---------------

 me think differently.

Suppose the two 9s are in positions 5 and6. Then the first four elements must

---------------

 add to 12, and the third and fourth elements (c and d) must add to16 (since their

---------------

 average is8). But then a + b +16 =12 ⇒ a +b =-4. No.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe there are three 9s? Let me see. Suppose three 9s. Then the remaining three numbers sum

---------------

 to 30 -27=3. So they could be 1,1,1. But then modes are 1 and9, both

---------------

 three times. Not unique. So invalid.

Hmm. Alternatively, two 9s and four other numbers adding to12.

---------------

 Let me try:

Let me set c and d as 6 and10. Wait, but then 10 would

---------------

 be part of the list. Let me see:

Wait, let me think of the list as [a, b, c

---------------

, d,9,9]. The median is (c + d)/2 =8 ⇒ c +d=16. The sum of a

---------------

 +b +c +d =30 -18=12 ⇒a +b=12 - (c +d)=12-16= -4. Not

---------------

 possible.

Hmm, so impossible.

Alternatively, maybe the two 9s are in the middle? Let me try:

Sup

---------------

pose the list is [a, b,9,9, c, d]. Then the median is (9 +9)/2=9, which is in the list. Not allowed.

Alternatively, [

---------------

a,9, b, c, d, e]. Then the median is (b +c)/2. Let's say

---------------

 that's 8, not in the list. Then b +c=16. The total sum is a +9 +b +c +d +e =30. So

---------------

 a +d +e =30 -9 -16=5. Since all are positive integers, a ≥1, d ≥c ≥

---------------

b ≥9? Wait, no. Wait the list is sorted, so a ≤9, b ≤9, etc. Wait,

---------------

 if the list is [a,9, b, c, d, e], then since it's sorted, a ≤9, and

---------------

 b ≥9. But if b is after 9, then b must be ≥9. So let me think:

The

---------------

 list in order: a ≤9 ≤ b ≤c ≤d ≤e. Wait, but if the second element is 9, then the first element is

---------------

 ≤9, and the third element is ≥9. To have the third and fourth elements (b and c) sum to16 (

---------------

for median 8), but 8 is not in the list. Wait, but if the third element is 9, then b

---------------

=9. Then c=7? But c has to be ≥b=9. So that's impossible. 

This

---------------

 is getting too convoluted. I think I have to accept that the only valid list is the four-element one, giving

---------------

 the sum of squares as236. Therefore, the answer is 236.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{236}


Given the problem, we need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in a list of positive integers with the following properties:

1. The sum of the items is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

### Key Steps:

1. **Understanding

---------------

 the Mode**: The mode is 9, which must appear more frequently than any other number. Since the mode is unique, no

---------------

 other number can appear as many times as 9.
2. **Median Consideration**: The median must be an integer not present in the list. This

---------------

 implies the list must have an even number of elements because an odd-length list's median would be an element of the list.
3. **Possible

---------------

 List Length**: Testing different even-length lists, we found that a 4-element list works best.

### Constructing the List:
- **Four

---------------

-element list**: 
  - The sum of the elements must be 30.
  - The mode is 9, so it must appear at least twice.
  - The median (

---------------

average of the two middle numbers) must be an integer not in the list.

**Example List**:
- Let the list be \([a, b, 9, 9]\) where \(a \leq b \leq 9\).
- The sum equation

---------------

: \(a + b + 9 + 9 = 30 \Rightarrow a + b = 12\).
- The median is \(\frac{b + 9}{2}\), which must be an integer not in the list.

**Valid

---------------

 Solution**:
- Choosing \(a = 5\) and \(b = 7\) (since \(5 + 7 = 12\)):
  - The list is \([5, 7, 9, 9]\).
  - Median: \(\frac{7 + 9}{2} = 8\), which is not in the list.
  - Mode: 9 appears twice, others once,

---------------

 so unique mode.
  - Sum: \(5 + 7 + 9 + 9 = 30\).

### Calculating the Sum of Squares:
- Sum

---------------

 of squares: \(5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236\).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{236}
