Okay, let's see. I have this problem with two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G are on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE. Hmm, okay

---------------

. Let me try to visualize this first.

First, since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So AB = CD = 107, and BC = AD = 16. Similarly, E

---------------

FGH is a rectangle, so EF = GH = 184, and FG = EH = 17. Wait

---------------

, FG is 17, so EH should also be 17? Let me confirm: in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So yes

---------------

, FG and EH are opposite sides, so FG = EH = 17, and EF and GH are 184. Got

---------------

 that.

Now, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. Let me try to sketch this mentally. Let me imagine

---------------

 rectangle ABCD: let's say it's positioned so that side AB is the top, BC is the right side, CD is the bottom, and DA is the left side. Then

---------------

, points D and C are the bottom-left and bottom-right corners of ABCD. Similarly, rectangle EFGH: since

---------------

 EFGH is a rectangle, let's see. The points E, F must be two adjacent corners. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, so

---------------

 the line D-E-C-F must be a straight line. So maybe the rectangles are placed such that one side of EFGH is along the line extending

---------------

 from DC?

Wait, perhaps I should assign coordinates to make this clearer. Let me try that. Let me set coordinate system with point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and

---------------

 if D is (0,0), then since AD = 16 (since BC = AD = 16), then

---------------

 point A would be at (0, 16). Then AB is 107, so point B is at (107, 16), and point C,

---------------

 which is opposite D, would be at (107, 0). Wait, no, hold on. Wait, in

---------------

 a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. Let me make sure the coordinates are correct.

Let me think again. Let me set

---------------

 point D at (0, 0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, side DC is along the x-axis, so

---------------

 point C is (length of DC, 0). But DC is equal to AB, which is 107. Wait, no

---------------

. Wait, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so AB = CD and BC = AD. Since AB is given as 107, then

---------------

 CD is also 107. BC is 16, so AD is 16. Therefore, if D is at (0,0), then A

---------------

 would be at (0, 16), then moving along AB (which is 107 units) to point B,

---------------

 so point B is at (107, 16), and then point C is at (107, 0). Yes

---------------

, that makes sense. So coordinates:

D: (0,0)

A: (0,16)

B: (107,16)

C: (107,0)

Now

---------------

, rectangle EFGH. The points E, F are on the line D-E-C-F. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, and

---------------

 D is (0,0), C is (107,0). So the line D-E-C-F is the x-axis?

---------------

 Wait, but D is at (0,0), C is at (107,0). So the line DC

---------------

 is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (107,0). But the points E and F are also on this line. So E and

---------------

 F must be somewhere along the x-axis between D and C, or beyond? Hmm. The problem doesn't specify their positions.

---------------

 Let me see.

Wait, since EFGH is a rectangle, and EF is 184. EF is one of the sides. So

---------------

 if E and F are on the x-axis, then EF would be a horizontal side. Since EFGH is a rectangle, then

---------------

 FG is vertical or horizontal? Wait, FG is 17. Since FG is another side. Since in rectangles, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So

---------------

 if EF is along the x-axis, then FG would be vertical. Since FG is 17, then the length of FG would be 

---------------

17, so if F is on the x-axis, then G would be 17 units above or below F.

---------------

 But also, the problem states that points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So point H and G must be positioned such that all

---------------

 four points are on a circle. Hmm, okay.

Let me try to assign coordinates to E and F. Let me denote

---------------

 the coordinates of E as (x, 0) and F as (x + 184, 0), since EF is 184. Wait, but EF

---------------

 is a side of the rectangle EFGH, so EF is either horizontal or vertical. Since E and F are on the x-axis, and

---------------

 the rectangle's sides are perpendicular, then FG would be vertical. So if E is at (e, 0), then F would be at (e + 184, 0),

---------------

 then moving up 17 units to G, so G would be (e + 184, 17), and then H would be at (e, 17). Alternatively

---------------

, maybe down? But since A, D, H, G are on a circle, maybe the direction matters. Let's suppose

---------------

 that FG is upward, so G is above F.

So let me define coordinates for rectangle EFGH:

Let me let

---------------

 E be at (k, 0). Then since EF is 184, and along the x-axis, F would be at (k + 184, 0). Then,

---------------

 since FG is 17 and perpendicular to EF, so FG would be vertical. Since it's a rectangle, the direction (

---------------

up or down) can be chosen, but let's assume upwards for now. So G would be at (k + 184, 17), and then H would be at (k, 17). So

---------------

 H is at (k,17), G is at (k+184,17). 

Now, the

---------------

 points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. Let me recall their coordinates:

A is at (0,16)



---------------

D is at (0,0)

H is at (k,17)

G is at (k+184,17)

We

---------------

 need these four points to lie on a circle. So we can use the condition that four points lie on a circle by ensuring

---------------

 that the determinant of the following matrix is zero:

|x y x² + y² 1|

for each point. Alternatively, since

---------------

 three points define a circle, the fourth must satisfy the equation. Alternatively, we can use the power of a point or cyclic

---------------

 quadrilateral properties. Hmm, perhaps using coordinates is better here.

Let me write the equation of the circle passing through A(0,16), D(0,0), H(k,17), and G(k+184,17). Let me first

---------------

 find the equation of the circle through A, D, and then see what condition is imposed by H and G.

First, let

---------------

's find the equation of the circle passing through A(0,16), D(0,0), and let's say

---------------

 H(k,17). Wait, but actually, since we have four points, all four must lie on the same circle. Let

---------------

 me set up equations.

The general equation of a circle is x² + y² + ax + by + c = 0. Let's plug in the points:

For point D(0,0):

0 + 0 + a*0 + b*0 + c = 0 ⇒ c = 0.

So the equation simplifies to x² + y² + ax + by = 0.

Now plug in point A(0,16):

0 + (16)^2 + a*0 + b*16 = 0 ⇒ 256 + 16b = 0 ⇒ 16b = -256 ⇒ b = -16.

So now the

---------------

 equation is x² + y² + ax -16y = 0.

Now, plug in point H(k,17):

k² + (17)^2 + a*k -16*17 = 0 ⇒ k² + 289 + a k - 272 = 0 ⇒ k² + a k + 17 = 0. (Equation 1)

Similarly, plug in point G(k+184,17):

(k + 184)^2 + (17)^2 + a*(k + 184) -16*17 = 0

Let me expand this:

(k² + 368k + 184²) + 289 + a k + 184a - 272 = 0

Wait

---------------

, let's compute step by step:

First term: (k + 184)^2 = k² + 2*184*k + 184² = k² + 368k + 33856 (since 184 squared

---------------

 is 184*184. Let me compute 180² + 8*180 + 8² = 32400 + 1440 + 64 = 33904? Wait no, 

---------------

184*184: 180² + 2*180*4 +4²= 32400 + 1440 +16= 33856. Yes

---------------

.

Second term: (17)^2 = 289.

Third term: a*(k + 184) = a k + 184a.

Fourth term: -16*17 = -272.

So putting

---------------

 all together:

(k² + 368k + 33856) + 289 + (a k + 184a) -272 = 0

Combine like terms:

k² + 368k + 33856 + 289 + a k + 184a - 272 = 0

Compute

---------------

 constants:

33856 + 289 = 34145; 34145 -272 = 33873.

So:



---------------

k² + (368k + a k) + (33873) + 184a = 0

Factor the

---------------

 k terms:

k² + k*(368 + a) + 33873 + 184a = 0. (Equation 2)

Now, from Equation 1,

---------------

 which was k² + a k +17 = 0.

Let me write Equation 1: k² + a k = -17.

So

---------------

, substitute k² + a k = -17 into Equation 2.

Equation 2 becomes:

(k² + a k) + 368k + 33873 + 184a = 0

Sub

---------------

stituting (k² + a k) = -17:

-17 + 368k + 33873 + 184a = 0

Simplify constants: -17 + 33873 = 33856



---------------

So:

368k + 184a + 33856 = 0

Divide entire

---------------

 equation by 184 to simplify:

(368 / 184)k + (184/

---------------

184)a + (33856 / 184) = 0

Calculates to:

2k + a + (33856 / 184) = 0

Compute

---------------

 33856 divided by 184:

Let me see: 184 * 184 is 33856,

---------------

 right? Wait 184*180=33120, plus 184*4=736, so 33120+736=33856. So

---------------

 33856 / 184 = 184.

Therefore:

2k + a + 184 = 0 ⇒ 2k + a = -184 ⇒

---------------

 a = -2k -184. (Equation 3)

Now, recall from Equation 1:

k² + a k +17 = 0.



---------------

Substitute a from Equation 3 into this:

k² + (-2k -184) *k +17 = 0

Expand:

k² -2k² -184k +17 = 0 ⇒ -k² -184k +17 = 0 ⇒ multiply

---------------

 both sides by -1:

k² + 184k -17 = 0.

So now, we

---------------

 have a quadratic equation in k:

k² + 184k -17 = 0.

Hmm, solving

---------------

 for k here. Let me apply quadratic formula:

k = [-184 ± sqrt(184² + 4*1*17)] / 2.

Compute discriminant:

184² is

---------------

 33856, plus 4*17=68, so discriminant is 33856 +68 = 33924.

Now

---------------

 sqrt(33924). Let me see if this is a perfect square. Let me compute 184 squared

---------------

 is 33856, so sqrt(33924) is a bit more. Let me see

---------------

 184.2 squared? Wait, maybe 184.1 squared? Hmm, but maybe exact value

---------------

.

Wait 184² = 33856, so 33924 - 33856 = 68. So sqrt(33856 + 68) = sqrt(184² + 68). Not

---------------

 a perfect square. Hmm, that's a problem? Maybe I made an error in calculation?

Wait, let me check my

---------------

 steps again. Let me retrace.

We had the four points on the circle: A(0,16), D(0,0), H(k,17), G(k+184,17). The

---------------

 equations led to the quadratic equation in k: k² +184k -17 =0. Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 that's correct. Let me see.

Wait, let's check the equations again step by step.

First, the circle equation through

---------------

 D(0,0), so c=0. Then through A(0,16):

0 + 256 + 0 +16b=0 ⇒ 16b = -256 ⇒ b=

---------------

 -16. Correct.

Then for H(k,17):

k² + 289 + a k -16*17 = 0.

---------------

 16*17 is 272, so 289 -272 = 17. So equation

---------------

 is k² + a k +17=0. Correct.

Then for G(k+184,17):

(k+184)^2 + 17² + a(k+184) -16*17 =0.

Exp

---------------

anding (k+184)^2 = k² + 368k + 184².

---------------

 Then 17² is 289. Then a(k+184) is a k + 184a. Then -16*17 is -272. So total

---------------

 equation:

k² + 368k + 184² + 289 + a k +184a -272 =0.

Then

---------------

 combining terms: k² + (368k + a k) + (184² +289 -272) + 184a =0.

Wait

---------------

, 184 squared is 33856, plus 289 is 34145 minus 272 is 33873. So constants

---------------

 are 33873. Then terms:

k² + k*(368 + a) + 33873 +184a =0. Correct

---------------

.

Then substituting from Equation 1, which was k² + a k = -17, so replacing k² + a k with -17 gives

---------------

:

-17 + 368k + 33873 +184a =0.



---------------

Yes, so 368k +184a + (33873 -17)= 368k +184a +33856 =0. Then

---------------

 dividing by 184 gives 2k +a +184=0 ⇒ a= -2k -184. Correct

---------------

.

Then plugging back into Equation 1: k² + a k +17 =0 ⇒ k² + (-2k -184)k +17 = k² -2k² -184k +17 = -k² -184k +17=0 ⇒ k² +184k -17=0. So

---------------

 that's correct.

Hmm, so the quadratic equation is correct, but the discriminant is 184² +4*17.

---------------

 Let me compute that again.

184 squared is (180+4)^2 = 180² + 2*180*4 +4² = 32400 + 1440 +16 = 33856. Then 

---------------

4*1*17=68, so discriminant is 33856 +68= 33924. Hmm

---------------

, sqrt(33924). Let me see if 184.2 squared is 33924?

---------------

 Let's see 184*184=33856, so 184.1^2 = (184 +0.1)^2 = 184² +2*184*0.1 +0.01 = 33856 +36.8 +0.01= 33892.81, which is still

---------------

 less. 184.2^2=184^2 +2*184*0.2 +0.2^2=33856 +73.6 +0.04= 33929.64,

---------------

 which is more than 33924. Hmm. So sqrt(33924) is between 184.1 and 184.2. But

---------------

 maybe it's exact?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the equations. Let me check once again.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I assumed FG is upwards. Maybe FG is downwards? Let me see. If FG is downward, then G

---------------

 would be at (k+184, -17), and H would be at (k, -17). Then

---------------

 points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(k, -17), G(k+184, -17). Maybe

---------------

 this gives a different equation? Let me try that.

Let me redo the coordinates with FG downward.

So if E is at (k,0), F is at (k+184, 0), then FG is downward 

---------------

17, so G is (k+184, -17), H is (k, -17). Then

---------------

 points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(k, -17), G(k+184, -17).

---------------

 Let me see if this might give a nicer equation.

Proceeding similarly, the circle equation through D(0,0),

---------------

 so c=0, and through A(0,16) gives b=-16 as before.

Then plug in H(k, -17):

k² + (-17)^2 + a k + b*(-17) = 0 ⇒

---------------

 k² + 289 + a k -16*(-17) ?

Wait, no, the general equation is x² + y² + a

---------------

 x + b y =0.

So for H(k, -17):

k² + (-17)^2 + a*k + b*(-17) =0 ⇒ k² + 289 + a k -16*(-17)

---------------

 ?

Wait, b is -16, so substituting:

k² + 289 + a k + (-16)*(-17) ?

Wait, hold

---------------

 on, the equation is x² + y² + a x + b y =0. Since b = -16,

---------------

 then the equation becomes x² + y² + a x -16 y =0.

Therefore, plugging H(k, -17):

k² + (-17)^2 + a*k -16*(-17) =0 ⇒ k² +289 + a k + 272 =0 ⇒ k² + a k + 

---------------

561 =0 (Equation 1a).

Similarly for G(k + 184, -17):

(k + 184)^2 + (-17)^2 + a*(k +184) -16*(-17) =0.

Compute

---------------

 each term:

(k+184)^2 = k² + 368k + 33856,

(-17)^2 =289,

a*(k +184)= a k +184a,

-16*(-17)=2

---------------

72.

So total equation:

k² +368k +33856 +289 +a k +184a +272 =0.

Combine terms:

k² + (368k + a k) + (33856 +289 +272) +184a =0.

Calcul

---------------

ating constants: 33856 +289 is 34145, plus 272 is 34417.

So:



---------------

k² +k*(368 +a) +34417 +184a =0. (Equation 2a)

Again, from Equation 1a: k² + a k = -561.



---------------

Substitute into Equation 2a:

(k² + a k) + 368k +34417 +184a =0 ⇒ -

---------------

561 +368k +34417 +184a =0 ⇒

368k +184a + (34417 -561)= 

---------------

368k +184a +33856 =0.

Same as before, dividing by 184:

2k +a +1

---------------

84 =0 ⇒ a = -2k -184. (Same as Equation 3)

Now plug into

---------------

 Equation 1a: k² + a k +561 =0.

Substituting a:

k² + (-2k -184)k +561 =0 ⇒ k² -2k² -184k +561 =0 ⇒ -k² -184k +561=0 ⇒



---------------

Multiply by -1: k² +184k -561=0.

Hmm, now discriminant is

---------------

 184² +4*1*561.

Compute discriminant: 184² is 33856, plus 4*561=2244 ⇒

---------------

 total 33856 +2244= 36100.

Ah, sqrt(36100)=190. That

---------------

's a perfect square. Nice!

So sqrt(36100)=190. So solutions:

k = [ -184 ±190 ] /2.

Compute

---------------

 both possibilities:

First, k = (-184 +190)/2 =6/2=3.

Second, k=

---------------

 (-184 -190)/2= -374/2= -187.

Hmm, so two

---------------

 solutions: k=3 and k= -187.

Now, let's consider which one is valid. Let's think

---------------

 about the positions.

First, since D is at (0,0), C is at (107,0). The points D,E,C,F are collinear on the x-axis. So

---------------

 E must lie between D and C, or beyond?

Wait, the problem says "drawn such that D,E,C,F are collinear".

---------------

 It doesn't specify the order. So the order could be D-E-C-F or D-C-E-F or E-D-C-F etc

---------------

. But since E and F are part of the rectangle EFGH, and EF=184, which is longer than CD

---------------

=107. Let me see.

If k=3, then E is at (3,0), so F would be at (3 +184,0)= (187,0). Since

---------------

 C is at (107,0), so the order on the line would be D(0,0)-E(3,0)-C(107,0)-F(187,0). So

---------------

 that's possible. The points D,E,C,F are in order along the x-axis.

Alternatively, if k= -187, then E is at (-187,0), so

---------------

 F would be at (-187 +184,0)= (-3,0). Then the points D(0,0), E(-187,0), C(107,0), F(-3,0). But

---------------

 this ordering would require that the points are arranged as E(-187,0)- ... - D(0,0)-F(-3,0)-

---------------

C(107,0). Wait, but F would be at -3, which is between D(0) and C(107). Hmm

---------------

, but the order would be E(-187), then D(0), then F(-3)? That doesn't make sense because

---------------

 F is at -3 which is between D(0) and E(-187)? Wait, no. If E is at -187, F would be at (-187 +

---------------

184)= -3, so F is to the right of E, but still left of D(0). So the order would

---------------

 be E(-187), F(-3), D(0), C(107). So the four points D

---------------

,E,C,F would be in the order E(-187), F(-3), D(0), C(107).

---------------

 But the problem states "D,E,C,F are collinear"—they can be in any order as long as they are on the same line. But

---------------

 perhaps both solutions are valid, but we need to check which one satisfies other conditions.

But let's see. The problem says

---------------

 "rectangles ABCD and EFGH are drawn such that D,E,C,F are collinear". Depending on the position

---------------

, the rectangle EFGH could be on either side. But since A, D, H, G lie on a circle, we

---------------

 need to see which k gives a valid circle.

First, let's consider k=3. Then E is at (3,0), F is at (187,0). G

---------------

 is at (187, -17), H is at (3, -17). Then points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(3,-17), G(187, -17). Do

---------------

 these lie on a circle?

Alternatively, with k=3, let's check the circle equation.

Wait, with k=3, let

---------------

's compute a from equation 3: a= -2k -184= -6 -184= -190.

So

---------------

 the circle equation is x² + y² -190x -16y =0.

Check if G(187, -17) is on this

---------------

 circle:

187² + (-17)^2 -190*187 -16*(-17).



---------------

Compute 187²: 187*187. Let me compute 180² + 2*180*7 +7²= 32400 +2520 +49=34969.



---------------

(-17)^2=289.

-190*187: 190*187=

---------------

 (200-10)*187=200*187 -10*187=37400 -1870=35530.

---------------

 So -35530.

-16*(-17)=272.

Total: 34969 +289 -35530 +272.



---------------

Compute step by step:

34969 +289 = 35258

35258 -35530 = -272

-272 +272 =0. Perfect

---------------

, so yes, it works.

Similarly check H(3,-17):

3² + (-17)^2 -190*3 -16*(-17)

---------------

 =9 +289 -570 +272 = (9+289)=298; (298 -

---------------

570)= -272; (-272 +272)=0. Good.

Similarly check A(0,16): 0 +256 -0 -16*16=256 -256=0. Correct

---------------

.

D(0,0): 0 +0 -0 -0=0. Correct.

So k=3 works.

Now check

---------------

 k=-187.

If k=-187, then E is at (-187,0), F is at (-187 +184,0)= (-3,0). G

---------------

 is at (-3, -17), H is at (-187, -17). Let's see if these

---------------

 four points lie on a circle.

Compute a from equation 3: a= -2*(-187) -184= 374 -184=190.

So

---------------

 the circle equation is x² + y² +190x -16y =0.

Check point G(-3, -17):

(-3)^2 + (-17)^2 +190*(-3) -16*(-17)=

---------------

9 +289 -570 +272.

Compute: 9+289=298; 298 -570= -272; -272 +272=0. Okay

---------------

.

H(-187, -17):

(-187)^2 + (-17)^2 +190*(-187) -16*(-17).

1

---------------

87 squared is 34969, so (-187)^2=34969.



---------------

(-17)^2=289.

190*(-187)= -35530.

-16*(-17)=272.

So total: 34969 +289 -35530 +272.



---------------

Same as before: 34969+289=35258; 35258 -35530= -272; -272 +272=0. Correct

---------------

.

A(0,16):

0 +256 +0 -16*16=256-256=0. Correct.

D(0,0): 

---------------

0+0+0 -0=0. Correct.

So both k=3 and k=-187 are valid.

---------------

 Hmm. So which one is the correct position?

Now, the problem says "rectangles ABCD and EFGH are drawn such that D,E,C,F are collinear". The

---------------

 problem doesn't specify the order, so both solutions could be possible, but we need to find CE.

CE is the distance between C

---------------

 and E. C is at (107,0). E is either at (3,0) or (-187,0).

So

---------------

 CE would be |107 -3|=104 or |107 - (-187)|= 

---------------

107+187=294.

But the problem might require the minimal one, or perhaps there is a

---------------

 constraint I missed. Wait, let's see.

Looking back at the problem: it says "A, D, H, G all lie on a circle". Both

---------------

 cases satisfy that. The problem doesn't specify any other constraints. So perhaps both are valid, but maybe in the context of the problem, the

---------------

 rectangle EFGH is placed such that it's extending beyond C, so that F is after C on the line. The

---------------

 problem might expect the positive distance. Wait, let's see the given lengths. EF is 184, which is longer than CD (

---------------

107). If E is before D, then F would be 184 units to the right of E. If E is at -187, then F is at -3, so between

---------------

 D and C. But EF length is 184, which is correct. Alternatively, if E is at 3, F is at 187, which is past

---------------

 C (107,0). So CE would be 104 or 294. Hmm.

Wait, the

---------------

 problem might have an unique answer, so perhaps I need to see which one makes sense in terms of the circle. Wait, but

---------------

 both do. Alternatively, maybe I made an assumption in direction.

Wait in my coordinate system, I assumed that FG was downward. If

---------------

 instead, when I first assumed FG was upward, leading to the equation with discriminant non-integer, but when I flipped

---------------

 it to downward, it worked. So maybe the direction is important? Let me check.

If I had assumed that FG was upward, then

---------------

 G would be at (k+184,17) and H at (k,17). Then the

---------------

 four points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(k,17), G(k+184,17). Let

---------------

 me see if those could lie on a circle.

Wait, with the first approach (assuming upward direction) led to the quadratic with discrimin

---------------

ant 33924 which was not a perfect square, leading to messy roots. But when we assumed downward, we

---------------

 got a clean solution. Since the problem didn't specify the direction of the rectangle, perhaps the downward is the correct one since

---------------

 it gives integer solutions, so maybe that's the intended path.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the rectangles are on the same side?

---------------

 Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem counts CE as a length, so positive. Both 104 and 294 are positive, but since

---------------

 104 is smaller, maybe that's the answer? Wait, but maybe the problem expects the distance when moving from C to E along the line D

---------------

-E-C-F. If the order is D-E-C-F, then CE would be C to E is towards D, so negative

---------------

, but distance is positive. Wait, but if the order is D-E-C-F, then E is between D and C, so CE would

---------------

 be C to E is 107 - E's coordinate. Wait, in the case of k=3, E is at (3,0), so CE is 107-3=104. Alternatively

---------------

, if the order is D-C-E-F, then E is after C, so CE would be 184-107? Wait no, need

---------------

 to see coordinates.

Wait, in the case of k=3, F is at (187,0). So the order on

---------------

 the line is D(0,0), E(3,0), C(107,0), F(187,0). So indeed

---------------

 D-E-C-F in order. So CE is 107-3=104. Alternatively, with k=-187, the points are E(-187,0), F(-3,0), D(0,0), C(107,0). So the order would

---------------

 be E(-187), F(-3), D(0), C(107). So CE here would be the

---------------

 distance from C(107,0) to E(-187,0): 107 - (-187)=294. But

---------------

 the problem says "D,E,C,F are collinear"—they can be in any order as long as they are collinear. But

---------------

 since the problem didn't specify, both could be possible. But since the problem is asking for CE, and in the case

---------------

 of the first solution (k=3) gives a smaller number, maybe that's the answer expected?

Alternatively, maybe there

---------------

's another constraint. Let me think about the circle again. If the rectangle is drawn with G above the x-axis, then points

---------------

 A(0,16), D(0,0), G(k+184,17), H(k,17). If

---------------

 G is above the x-axis at 17, which is close to A's y-coordinate of 16. Maybe

---------------

 they can lie on a circle. Wait, but in the first calculation (assuming upward direction), the quadratic had non-integer solutions

---------------

, but maybe it's okay. Wait, but the problem might not require integer coordinates, but the answer is an integer.

---------------

 Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I made an error in assuming the direction. Since the problem didn't specify, but given that both

---------------

 solutions are mathematically valid, but the problem is likely expecting the one where E is between D and C, leading to CE=104, which

---------------

 is an answer. Alternatively, the problem might have a unique solution based on the circle condition.

Wait, let me check the

---------------

 problem statement again: "A, D, H, G all lie on a circle". In the case when k=3, H

---------------

 is at (3,-17), G is at (187,-17). So those points are below the x-axis, while A is at (0,16) and D is at (0,0). The

---------------

 circle passes through these four points. Similarly for k=-187, the points H and G are also at -17,

---------------

 so same as the other case. The problem doesn't state any other constraints, so both solutions are possible. However, since

---------------

 the problem is from a competition likely expecting a single answer, maybe I need to check for another condition.

Wait, perhaps the length

---------------

 of CE must be positive, but both are positive. Alternatively, maybe the problem implies that E is between D and C,

---------------

 so that the order is D-E-C-F. Because otherwise, if E is to the left of D, then F would be between

---------------

 D and C, which might complicate the rectangle's position. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that EFGH is placed such that F

---------------

 is beyond C, so that the collinear points are D-E-C-F in order. If that's the case, then the

---------------

 answer would be 104.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's use of the names of the rectangles' vertices implies a

---------------

 direction. For example, rectangle EFGH: the order of the vertices suggests that after E comes F, so moving from E to F is

---------------

 along the side EF. Since D,E,C,F are collinear, if the order is D-E-C-F, then moving

---------------

 from E to F is away from D, so that makes sense. Alternatively, if the order is E-D-C-F, then moving

---------------

 from E to D would be towards D. Hmm, but the problem just says they are collinear without order.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 the problem's diagram (which we don't have) has E between D and C, so the answer is 104. Since

---------------

 104 is smaller and perhaps the intended answer, and the other case might be a trick, but since both math

---------------

ematically valid, but maybe the problem expects the first solution. Since in my first assumption, when I thought of the direction

---------------

, I had to flip to downward to get a nice answer. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the four points A,D,H,G are

---------------

 on a circle in order, making a quadrilateral. If they are in order on the circle, but that might not matter

---------------

.

Alternatively, let me think of the power of point C with respect to the circle. Wait, maybe overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 the problem is designed so that the answer is 104. Since in the first case, that's the answer.

---------------

 Given that in competitions often such problems have unique answers, and since 104 is an integer and the other is 294, which

---------------

 is also integer. Wait, but both are integers. Hmm.

Wait, let me check the problem statement again: Rectangles ABCD and EFGH. The

---------------

 order of the vertices is important for the rectangle's orientation. For rectangle ABCD, the order is A-B-C-D-A, forming

---------------

 a rectangle. Similarly for EFGH: E-F-G-H-E. So if we consider the rectangle EFGH, the

---------------

 sides are EF, FG, GH, HE. So if E is at (k,0), F is at (k+184,0), then G

---------------

 would be at (k+184,17) or (k+184,-17). If

---------------

 it's upward, then H would be at (k,17). If downward, H is at (k, -17). 



---------------

Now, the points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. In the case where H and G are above the x-axis (up

---------------

ward direction), then points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(k,17), G(k+184,17). Let

---------------

 me see if this is possible.

Wait, in that case, let me redo the equations with upward direction. Previously when I assumed

---------------

 upward, the quadratic equation had discriminant sqrt(33924). Let me compute that again. sqrt(33924). Let

---------------

's see, 184^2 =33856, so sqrt(33924)=sqrt(33856+68)=sqrt

---------------

(33856)+something. Let me see, 184.2^2= (184 +0.2)^2=184² +2*184*0.2 +0.2²=33856 +73.6 +0.04=33929.64.

---------------

 Which is more than 33924. So sqrt(33924) is approximately 184.19

---------------

. Not an integer. So the solution would be irrational, which is okay, but the problem asks for an integer answer, so maybe

---------------

 that case is invalid? Since the problem states all lengths as integers, perhaps the answer must be integer, so the k must

---------------

 be integer. Since in the downward case, k=3 and k=-187 are integers, but in the upward case, the

---------------

 k would be irrational, so that case is invalid? Wait, but the problem didn't state that the coordinates have to be integers. Hmm

---------------

.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires the four points A, D, H, G to lie on a circle, but in

---------------

 the upward case, with k non-integer, but that's still possible. However, the problem asks for an integer answer,

---------------

 so probably expects the downward case where k is integer, giving CE as 104 or 294. But

---------------

 since both k=3 and k=-187 give integer coordinates and integer CE, but the problem might want the smaller

---------------

 one. Alternatively, maybe there's another consideration.

Wait, the problem says "rectangles ABCD and EFGH are drawn such that D,E,C,F are collinear". The

---------------

 order might be important in terms of the rectangle's placement. If EFGH is a rectangle, then the sides must be perpendicular

---------------

. If E is between D and C, then F is beyond C, so the rectangle EFGH would have F beyond

---------------

 C, and G and H would be above or below. If E is before D, then F is between D and C

---------------

, so the rectangle EFGH would have part overlapping with ABCD?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem implies that the rectangles are placed such

---------------

 that they don't overlap except possibly at points. If E is between D and C, then EFGH extends beyond C, so

---------------

 no overlapping. If E is before D, then part of EFGH would be to the left of D, but that

---------------

 might be acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the distance CE where E is between D and C, so the answer is 104. Since

---------------

 that's a common case. Given that both solutions are valid, but 104 is more likely the answer expected here

---------------

.

Wait, let me check with k=3, the distance CE is 104. The problem gives BC=16, which is the height of rectangle ABCD. The

---------------

 other rectangle has FG=17, which is its height. Since 17 is close to 16, maybe

---------------

 the downward direction makes their heights "opposite" but on the same line, but not sure.

Alternatively, let me compute

---------------

 the power of point C with respect to the circle. Wait, in the case of k=3, the circle equation is x² + y² -190x -16y =0. The

---------------

 point C is (107,0). Let's see if C lies on the circle: plugging into the equation:

---------------

 107² +0 -190*107 -16*0. 107²=

---------------

11449; 190*107= 190*100 +190*7=19000+1330=20330. So 11449 -20330 = -8881 ≠0. So C is not on the circle, which is fine because

---------------

 the problem only requires A,D,H,G to be on the circle.

Alternatively, if we consider the other case with k=-187, the

---------------

 circle equation is x² + y² +190x -16y=0. Plugging in C(107,0): 107² +0 +190*107 -0 =

---------------

11449 + 190*107. 190*100=19000, 190*7=1330 ⇒

---------------

 total 20330. So 11449 +20330=31779 ≠0. So C is not on the circle either

---------------

. So that's okay.

Hmm. I think both solutions are valid, but the problem might expect the one where E is between D and C, so

---------------

 CE is 104. Since the problem mentions the order D,E,C,F being collinear, which can be interpreted

---------------

 as the order D-E-C-F, so E between D and C, F beyond C. Therefore, the answer is 104.

Alternatively

---------------

, maybe I made an error in the direction assumption. Wait, in the downward case, the points H and G are below the x-axis. The

---------------

 problem didn't specify where the rectangles are, so that's acceptable. Alternatively, if I had assumed upward, with k=

---------------

3, but then the circle equation would have a non-integer k, but the problem allows for any real k. However

---------------

, since the problem gives integer lengths and asks for an integer answer, the case where k is integer is more plausible.

Therefore

---------------

, I think the answer is 104.

Wait, but in the case of k=-187, CE is 294, which is also an integer. But

---------------

 which one is correct?

Wait, let me think of the rectangle EFGH with k=-187. Then E is at (-187,0), F at (-3,0), so EF length is 184, which

---------------

 is correct. FG is 17 downward to G(-3,-17), H is at (-187,-17). The

---------------

 rectangle is from E(-187,0) to F(-3,0) to G(-3,-17) to H(-187,-17). Then

---------------

 points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(-187,-17), G(-3,-17) lie

---------------

 on a circle, which we confirmed.

But then CE is the distance from C(107,0) to E(-187,0)

---------------

 which is 107 - (-187)=294. So that's valid. 

Hmm. The

---------------

 problem might have two solutions, but in competitions, sometimes the answer is the smaller one. Alternatively, the problem might have a unique

---------------

 solution, and my error is in the coordinate setup.

Wait, let me check the problem again: "A, D, H, G all lie on a circle." In

---------------

 the case of k=3, H is at (3,-17), G at (187,-17). The

---------------

 points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(3,-17), G(187,-17). Let

---------------

 me see if these four points are concyclic.

Alternatively, maybe there's a property I can use here. For four points to be concyclic, the power of point relations

---------------

 must hold. Alternatively, compute the circle's center and radius.

In the case of k=3, the circle equation is x² + y² -190x -16y =0. To

---------------

 find the center and radius, complete the squares:

x² -190x + y² -16y =0.

x² -190x + (190/2)^2 + y² -16y + (8)^2 = (190/2)^2 +8².

So

---------------

,

(x -95)^2 + (y -8)^2 = 95² +64.

Compute 95²:

---------------

 90² +2*90*5 +5²=8100+900+25=9025. So 9025 +64=9089.

So

---------------

 the center is at (95,8), radius sqrt(9089). Not sure if that helps, but the

---------------

 points are on the circle.

Alternatively, the problem might require that the points are in convex position or something, but I don

---------------

't think so.

Alternatively, since the problem mentions rectangles, maybe there is an orthogonality condition. Wait, but

---------------

 rectangles are already orthogonal.

Alternatively, maybe the length of AD is 16, and EH is 17, so close

---------------

 to each other, but I don't see how that helps.

Alternatively, maybe there is a property I'm missing. Let me think differently

---------------

.

Since A, D, H, G are concyclic, the power of point C with respect to the circle might relate

---------------

. Wait, but I don't see the connection.

Alternatively, let me consider inversion or other methods, but that might be overkill.

Alternatively, since

---------------

 the problem gives BC=16, which is the side AD, and FG=17, which is EH. Maybe

---------------

 the distance between the centers or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that in rectangle EFGH, the side EH is 17, so if

---------------

 we consider the positions, maybe the vertical distance between the rectangles is 1 or something, but not sure.

Alternatively, let

---------------

 me think of the circle passing through A, D, H, G. The points D and A are on the y-axis. The

---------------

 other two points H and G are on a horizontal line y=17 or y=-17. Let me see for

---------------

 the case of downward direction (y=-17):

Points H(k, -17) and G(k+184, -17). The circle passes through (0,16), (0,0), (k, -17), (k+184, -17). 



---------------

The general equation of a circle passing through (0,0) is x² + y² + ax + by =0. 



---------------

We found that with b=-16, so equation is x² + y² +ax -16y=0.

Then

---------------

, substituting H and G gives the equations leading to k=3 or -187. 

Since both are valid, and

---------------

 the problem doesn't specify, but since the problem is from a competition expecting a single answer, maybe I need to see which

---------------

 value of CE is possible.

Wait, but the problem says "the length of CE"—length is always positive, so both 104 and 294 are possible

---------------

. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps there is a miscalculation in the quadratic solution?

Wait when k=-187, CE

---------------

 is 107 - (-187)=294, which is correct. But the problem might have a

---------------

 unique solution, so maybe I made a wrong assumption in the coordinate system.

Wait let me try a different approach without coordinates.

Let me consider

---------------

 the power of point C with respect to the circle passing through A, D, H, G.

The power of point C is

---------------

 equal to CA * CB (if C lies outside the circle). Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, since points A, D are on the circle, the

---------------

 power of C with respect to the circle is CO^2 - r^2, where O is the center. But maybe

---------------

 this is too vague.

Alternatively, since AD is a vertical side of rectangle ABCD with length 16, and EH is a

---------------

 vertical side of EFGH with length 17. Since A,D,H,G are concyclic, perhaps there's a relation between the

---------------

 heights.

Alternatively, since AD = 16 and EH =17, which are almost the same, maybe the points

---------------

 are arranged such that the circle's diameter is AD or something, but not sure.

Alternatively, think of the circle passing through A(0,16), D(0,0), which

---------------

 is a vertical line segment of length 16. The other two points H and G are on a horizontal line y=

---------------

±17, 184 units apart. The circle must pass through these four points.

The circle through A and D has

---------------

 its center along the perpendicular bisector of AD, which is the horizontal line y=8. The center is at (h,8). The distance

---------------

 from center (h,8) to A(0,16) must equal the distance to H(k, -17).



---------------

So:

sqrt( (h -0)^2 + (8 -16)^2 ) = sqrt( (h -k)^2 + (8 - (-17))^2 )

Square both sides:

h² + 64 = (h -k)^2 + (25)^2

Expand (

---------------

h -k)^2 = h² - 2hk +k², 25²=625:



---------------

h² +64 = h² -2hk +k² +625

Simplify:

64 = -2hk +k² +625 ⇒

-2hk +k² = 64 -625 ⇒ -2hk +k²= -561 ⇒

k² -2 h k +561=0.

---------------

 (Equation A)

Similarly, the distance from center (h,8) to G(k+184, -17) must equal

---------------

 the radius:

sqrt( (h - (k+184))² + (8 +17)^2 ) = sqrt( h² +64 )

Square both sides:

(h - (k+184))² + 625 = h² +64

Expand left side:

(h -k -184)^2 +625 = h² -2h(k+184) + (k+184)^2 +625

Set equal to h² +64:

h² -2h(k+184) + (k+184)^2 +625 = h² +64

Cancel h²:

-2h(k+184) + (k+184)^2 +625 =64

R

---------------

earrange:

-2h(k+184) + (k+184)^2 =64 -625 ⇒

---------------



-2h(k+184) + (k+184)^2 = -561 ⇒

---------------



Let me factor out (k+184):

(k+184)[ -2h + (k+184) ] = -561 ⇒

---------------



(k+184)(k +184 -2h) = -561. (Equation B)

Now,

---------------

 from Equation A: k² -2 h k +561=0 ⇒ rearranged: k² +561 = 2 h k ⇒ h = (k² +561)/(2k)



---------------

Plug this into Equation B:

(k+184)[k +184 -2*( (k² +561)/(2k) ) ] = -561

Simplify inside the brackets:

k +184 - (k² +561)/k = [k(k +184) - (k² +561)] /k

Compute numerator:

k² +184k -k² -561 =184k -561.

So the expression

---------------

 becomes:

(k+184)*( (184k -561)/k ) = -561

Multiply

---------------

 both sides by k:

(k+184)(184k -561) = -561k

Expand left side:

k*(184k -561) +184*(184k -561) =

184k² -561k + 184*184k -184*561

Compute

---------------

 terms:

184k² -561k + (184²)k - (184*561)

Combine

---------------

 like terms:

184k² + [ -561 + 184² ]k -184*561



---------------

Set equal to -561k:

184k² + [ -561 + 33856 ]k -184*561 = -561k

S

---------------

implify coefficients:

184k² + (33295)k -184*561 = -561k

Bring all terms to left side:

184k² +33295k -184*561 +561k =0 ⇒

184k² + (33295 +561)k -184*561 =0 ⇒

184k² +33856k -184*561=0

Factor

---------------

 184 from first two terms:

184(k² + 184k) -184*561 =0 ⇒

184[

---------------

 k² +184k -561 ] =0 ⇒

Since 184 ≠0,

k² +184k -561 =0 ⇒

---------------

 which is the same equation as before. So that checks out.

Thus, the solutions are k= [ -184 ± sqrt(184² +4*561) ]/2 =

---------------

 [ -184 ± sqrt(33856+2244) ]/2 = sqrt(36100)=190,

---------------

 so k=( -184 ±190)/2 ⇒ 3 or -187. So no mistake

---------------

 here.

Therefore, there are two solutions. But the problem says "the length of CE"—so maybe both are acceptable,

---------------

 but the problem might expect the one where E is between D and C, so 104. Since in the problem statement,

---------------

 the order D,E,C,F are collinear, which could be interpreted as the order D-E-C-F, so E between D and C. Hence

---------------

, the answer is 104.

Thus, I think the answer is 104.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{104}


Given rectangles \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) with \(D, E, C, F\) collinear and \(A, D, H, G\) on a circle, we need to find the length of \(CE\). 

1. **Coordinates Setup**:
   - Rectangle

---------------

 \(ABCD\) has \(D\) at \((0, 0)\), \(A\) at \((0, 16)\), \(B\) at \((107, 16)\), and \(C\) at \((107, 0)\).
   - Rectangle \(EFGH\) has \(E\) at \((k, 0)\), \(F\) at \((k + 184, 0)\), \(G\) at \((k + 184, -17)\), and \(H\) at \((k, -17)\) (assuming downward direction for \(

---------------

FG\)).

2. **Circle Equation**:
   - The circle passes through \(A(0, 16)\), \(D(0, 0)\), \(H(k, -17)\), and \(G(k + 184, -17)\).
   - The

---------------

 general circle equation is \(x^2 + y^2 + ax + by = 0\).
   - Substituting \(D(0, 0)\) gives \(c = 0\).
   - Substituting \(A(0, 16)\) gives \(b = -16\).
   - Substituting \(H(k, -17)\) and \(G(k + 184, -17)\) leads to solving the quadratic equation \(k^2 + 184k - 561 = 0\).

3. **Solving the Quadratic Equation**:
   - The solutions are \(k = 3\) and \(k = -187\).
   - For \(k = 3\), \(E\) is at \((3, 0)\) and \(CE = 107 - 3 = 104\).
   - For \(k = -187\), \(E\) is at \((-187, 0)\) and \(CE = 107 - (-187) = 294\).

4. **Considering

---------------

 Collinearity Order**:
   - The problem states \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear. The valid

---------------

 order \(D-E-C-F\) implies \(E\) is between \(D\) and \(C\), leading to \(CE = 104\).

Thus, the length of \(CE\) is \(\boxed{104}\).<|im_end|>
