Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, let

---------------

's see. Alright, first, let me recall that for complex numbers, the modulus |z| is 4, so z is on a circle with radius 4 in the complex plane. 



---------------

The expression given is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. The

---------------

 real part of this expression is what we need to maximize. Since we're dealing with complex numbers and their real parts, maybe I can write

---------------

 z in terms of its polar form to make things easier. 

Let me denote z as 4e^{iθ}, since its modulus is 4. Then

---------------

 1/z would be (1/(4e^{iθ})) = (1/4)e^{-iθ}. That

---------------

 might help simplify the expression. Let's try substituting that in.

First, let's compute (75 + 117i)z. Sub

---------------

stituting z = 4e^{iθ}, that becomes (75 + 117i)*4e^{iθ} = 4*(75 + 117i)e^{iθ}. Similarly, the second term is (96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i)/(4e^{iθ}) = (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

So the entire expression becomes 

---------------

4*(75 + 117i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}. Now

---------------

, to find the real part of this expression, I can separate the real and imaginary parts of each term.

Alternatively, maybe it

---------------

's better to write each term in terms of cosine and sine. Let me think. Since e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ. Let

---------------

 me expand each term:

First term: 4*(75 + 117i)(cosθ + i sinθ)


---------------

Second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)

Let me compute each term separately

---------------

.

Starting with the first term: 4*(75 + 117i)(cosθ + i sinθ).

---------------

 Let's distribute the multiplication:

First, multiply (75 + 117i) by (cosθ + i sinθ):

=

---------------

 75*cosθ + 75i sinθ + 117i cosθ + 117i^2 sinθ

Since

---------------

 i^2 = -1, so the last term becomes -117 sinθ.

So combining terms:

Real parts: 75 cosθ - 117 sinθ

Imaginary parts: 75 sinθ + 117 cosθ

Multiply all

---------------

 of this by 4:

First term overall:

Real part: 4*(75 cosθ - 117 sinθ)

Imaginary part: 4*(75 sinθ + 117 cosθ)

Second

---------------

 term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ). Let's expand this similarly:

2

---------------

4*cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ

Again, i^2 = -1, so the last term becomes +36 sinθ.

So

---------------

 combining terms:

Real parts: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ

Imaginary parts: -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ

So

---------------

 the second term's real part is 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ, and imaginary part is (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ).

Now, adding

---------------

 the two terms together, the entire expression's real part will be the sum of the real parts of the first and second terms, and similarly for the imaginary parts. Since

---------------

 we only care about the real part, let's compute that:

Total real part = [4*(75 cosθ - 117 sinθ)] + [24 cosθ + 36 sinθ]

Let me compute each

---------------

 part step by step.

First, compute 4*(75 cosθ - 117 sinθ):

4*75 cosθ = 300 cosθ

4*(-117 sinθ) = -468 sinθ

Then

---------------

, adding the second term's real part:

24 cosθ + 36 sinθ

So altogether:

Total real part = (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ)

Combine like terms:

cosθ terms: 300 + 24 = 324 cosθ

sinθ terms: -468 + 36 = -432 sinθ

So

---------------

 the real part simplifies to 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Therefore, the real part of the entire

---------------

 expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Our goal is to maximize this expression with respect to θ.

Hmm, so

---------------

 the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. This is a standard trigonometric optimization

---------------

 problem. The maximum of A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A² + B²). Wait, but here the coefficients

---------------

 are 324 and -432. Let me confirm:

Wait, the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So

---------------

 in terms of the formula, it's like A cosθ + B sinθ where A = 324 and B = -432. The maximum value of

---------------

 such an expression is sqrt(A² + B²). Let me compute that.

First, compute A squared plus B squared:

324² + (-432)^2.



---------------

Let me compute 324 squared. 324 is 18^2 * 3, since 18^2 is 324.

---------------

 Wait no, 18^2 is 324. Wait, actually 324 is 18²

---------------

, so 324 squared is (18²)^2 = 18^4. Hmm, but maybe better

---------------

 to compute directly.

Alternatively, 324^2 = (300 + 24)^2 = 300² + 2*300*24 + 24² = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000+14400 is 104400, plus 576 is 104,976.

Similarly, 432 squared is

---------------

 (400 + 32)^2 = 400² + 2*400*32 + 32² = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 160,000 +25,600 is 185,600,

---------------

 plus 1,024 is 186,624.

Therefore, A² + B² = 104,976 + 186,624 = let

---------------

's compute that. 104,976 + 186,624. Let's add 100,000 + 180,000 = 280,000. Then 4,976 + 6,624 = 11,600. So total is 280,000 +11,600 = 291,600. 



---------------

Therefore sqrt(291,600). Let me see, sqrt(291600). Since

---------------

 540 squared is 291,600 because 500² is 250,000 and 540² = (500 +40)^2 = 500² + 2*500*40 + 40² = 250,000 +40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. So

---------------

 sqrt(291,600) is 540.

Therefore, the maximum value of 324 cosθ -432 sinθ is 540. Wait

---------------

, but hold on. Let me confirm the formula again. The maximum of A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A² + B²). But

---------------

 in our case, the expression is A cosθ + B sinθ where A = 324 and B = -432. So

---------------

 yes, the maximum is sqrt(324² + (-432)^2) = sqrt(291600) = 540. 



---------------

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540. But wait, is that correct? Let me check my steps again because

---------------

 sometimes when coefficients are negative, the angle might be different, but the maximum value is still the same. Since the formula holds

---------------

 regardless of the signs. So yes, the maximum should indeed be 540. 

But let me verify with an

---------------

 example. Suppose we set θ such that the expression reaches its maximum. Let me see, the maximum occurs when the angle θ is such that cosθ = A / sqrt(A² + B²), sinθ = B / sqrt(A² + B²). Wait, actually, in

---------------

 the standard formula, the maximum of A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A² + B²), achieved when θ is equal to the angle of the vector (A,B). But

---------------

 in this case, our expression is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, which can be considered as A cosθ + B sinθ where B is negative. So

---------------

 the angle would be such that cosφ = A / sqrt(A² + B²) and sinφ = B / sqrt(A² + B²). Since

---------------

 B is negative, the angle φ would be in a different quadrant. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the expression as R

---------------

 cos(θ - φ), where R is the amplitude. Let me see. Let me confirm the formula again. 

Yes

---------------

, the maximum value of a*cosθ + b*sinθ is sqrt(a² + b²). So in our case, even

---------------

 with the negative coefficient for sinθ, the maximum is still sqrt(324² + (-432)^2) = 540. 



---------------

Therefore, the answer should be 540. Wait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the earlier

---------------

 steps when combining terms. Let me go back through the calculations.

Original expression real part: 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So

---------------

 yes, that comes from:

First term real part: 4*(75 cosθ - 117 sinθ) = 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Second term real part: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ. 

Adding together

---------------

: 300 +24 = 324 cosθ, and -468 +36 = -432 sinθ. So

---------------

 that's correct.

Therefore, the real part is indeed 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. So

---------------

 the maximum is sqrt(324² + 432²). Wait, but hold on, in the formula, it

---------------

's sqrt(A² + B²), where A is the coefficient of cosθ and B is the coefficient of sinθ. Here

---------------

, A = 324, B = -432, so B squared is same as 432 squared. So

---------------

 sqrt( (324)^2 + (432)^2 ) = sqrt( 104,976 + 186,624 ) = sqrt(291,600) = 540. So

---------------

 that's correct.

Therefore, the maximum possible real part is 540. Hmm, but let me think again if

---------------

 there's any step I might have messed up, especially in expanding the terms. Let me recheck the expansion of (75 + 117i)z and

---------------

 (96 +144i)/z.

Starting with z = 4e^{iθ}, so (75 +117i)z is

---------------

 (75+117i)*4e^{iθ}. Then when expanding (75 +117i)(cosθ + i sinθ):

7

---------------

5 cosθ +75 i sinθ + 117i cosθ + 117i² sinθ



---------------

=75 cosθ + i(75 sinθ +117 cosθ) -117 sinθ



---------------

Therefore real part is 75 cosθ -117 sinθ, multiplied by 4 gives 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ. That

---------------

's correct.

Then (96 +144i)/z = (96 +144i)/ (4e^{iθ}) = (24 +36i)

---------------

 e^{-iθ} = (24 +36i)(cosθ -i sinθ). 

Expanding that

---------------

: 24 cosθ -24i sinθ +36i cosθ -36i² sinθ



---------------

=24 cosθ +36 sinθ +i( -24 sinθ +36 cosθ )

Therefore

---------------

 real part is 24 cosθ +36 sinθ. That's correct. 

Adding the two real parts:



---------------

300 cosθ -468 sinθ +24 cosθ +36 sinθ = 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. Correct

---------------

.

Therefore, the maximum is indeed 540. Wait, but before I get too confident, let me check if

---------------

 there is any constraint on θ? Since z is a complex number with |z|=4, θ can be any real number between

---------------

 0 and 2π, so the maximum over θ is indeed achievable. 

Therefore, the answer should be 540. Hmm

---------------

, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial substitution?

Wait, another way to approach this problem is

---------------

 by using calculus. Let me try that approach to confirm.

Suppose we need to maximize f(θ) = 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. To

---------------

 find the maximum, take derivative and set to zero.

f’(θ) = -324 sinθ -432 cosθ. Setting this

---------------

 equal to zero:

-324 sinθ -432 cosθ =0 → 324 sinθ +432 cosθ =0 → 

---------------

324 sinθ = -432 cosθ → tanθ = -432/324 = -4/3.3

---------------

33... Wait, 432 divided by 324. Let me compute that. 432 /

---------------

 324 = 4/3 (since both divided by 108: 432 ÷ 108=4, 324 ÷108=3). So tanθ = - (432/324) = -4/3. 



---------------

Therefore, tanθ = -4/3. Let me find θ where tanθ = -4/3. 



---------------

The angle θ would be in the second or fourth quadrant. Let me compute sinθ and cosθ for that angle.

Let me consider

---------------

 θ such that tanθ = -4/3. Let me think of a reference angle α where tanα = 4/3. So then

---------------

, in the fourth quadrant, cosθ = 3/5 and sinθ = -4/5. Alternatively, in the second quadrant, cosθ = -3/5 and sinθ =4/5.

Wait

---------------

, but let me see which one gives the maximum. Let me plug into f(θ):

f(θ) = 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

Sup

---------------

pose θ is in the fourth quadrant: cosθ = 3/5, sinθ = -4/5.



---------------

Then f(θ) = 324*(3/5) -432*(-4/5) = (972/5) + (1728/5) = (972 +1728)/5 = 2700/5 = 540.

Alternatively, in the second quadrant: cosθ = -3/5, sinθ =4/5.



---------------

Then f(θ) = 324*(-3/5) -432*(4/5) = (-972/5) - (1728/5) = (-2700)/5 = -540. So

---------------

 that's the minimum. 

Therefore, the maximum is indeed 540. So that confirms the previous result. 



---------------

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540. 

Wait, but before I conclude, let me check if

---------------

 there is another approach, perhaps using vectors or complex numbers differently? For instance, treating the expression as a complex function and finding

---------------

 its maximum real part. Alternatively, maybe using Lagrange multipliers? 

Alternatively, consider that for complex numbers with |z|=4, we

---------------

 can write z = 4e^{iθ}, so 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}. Let

---------------

 me denote w = z, so that 1/z = \overline{w}/|w|², but since |w|=4, then

---------------

 1/z = \overline{w}/16. Hmm, maybe not helpful. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can set

---------------

 variables as real and imaginary parts. Let me try that. Let me let z = x + yi, with x and y real numbers such

---------------

 that x² + y² = 16 (since |z|=4). 

Then, compute the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z. Let

---------------

 me compute each term:

First term: (75 +117i)(x + yi) = 75x +75yi +117i x +117i^2 y = 75x -117y + i(75y +117x)

Second term: (96 +144i)/(x + yi). To compute this, multiply numerator and denominator by (x - yi):

(

---------------

96 +144i)(x - yi) / (x² + y²). Since x² + y² =16, denominator

---------------

 is 16.

So numerator: 96x -96yi +144i x -144i² y = 96x +144y + i(144x -96y). Therefore

---------------

, the second term is [96x +144y + i(144x -96y)] /16.



---------------

Therefore, the entire expression is:

First term real part: 75x -117y

First term imaginary part:75y +117x

Second term real part: (96x +144y)/16 = (96x +144y)/16 = (

---------------

6x +9y)/1 (divided numerator and denominator by 16/16: 96/16=6, 144/16=9)

Second term imaginary part: (144x -96y)/16 = (9x -6y)/1 (div

---------------

ided numerator and denominator by 16: 144/16=9, 96/16=6)

Therefore, the

---------------

 total real part is:

(75x -117y) + (6x +9y) = 75x +6x -117y +9y =81x -108y

Wait

---------------

 a minute, this contradicts my previous result where I had 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. Hmm

---------------

, so here, using real and imaginary parts, I get the real part as 81x -108y. Wait

---------------

, so which is correct?

Hmm, that's a problem. There must be a mistake here because the two methods should give the same result. Let me check again

---------------

.

Wait, in the second approach, when I computed the first term's real part as 75x -117y.

---------------

 Let's confirm:

First term is (75 +117i)(x + yi). Multiplying out:

75*x + 75*yi + 117i*x +117i*yi



---------------

=75x + (75y)i + 117x i + 117y i²

=

---------------

75x -117y (since i²=-1) + i*(75y +117x). So

---------------

 the real part is indeed 75x -117y. 

Second term: (96+144i)/(x + yi). Multiply

---------------

 numerator and denominator by (x - yi):

Numerator: (96 +144i)(x - yi) =96x -96yi +144i x -144i² y



---------------

=96x +144y (since -i² y = + y) + i*( -96y +144x )

Therefore

---------------

, numerator real part is 96x +144y, imaginary part is (144x -96y). Then

---------------

 dividing by 16 gives real part (96x +144y)/16 =6x +9y,

---------------

 and imaginary part (144x -96y)/16=9x -6y. So the real

---------------

 part of the second term is indeed 6x +9y. 

Therefore, the total real part is (75x -117y) + (6x +9y) =81x -108y. Wait

---------------

, that's different from the previous result of 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. 

Hmm, so

---------------

 now I have a discrepancy. Which one is correct? Let's see. 

Wait, in the first approach, I used

---------------

 polar coordinates with z =4e^{iθ}, so x =4 cosθ, y =4 sinθ. Let

---------------

 me substitute x =4 cosθ, y=4 sinθ into the expression 81x -108y.

---------------

 Then we get 81*(4 cosθ) -108*(4 sinθ)= 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, which matches the first approach

---------------

. So that is consistent. So the real part is indeed 81x -108y, which in polar coordinates becomes

---------------

 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. So the two approaches are consistent. 

Therefore, the real

---------------

 part is 81x -108y, which we can write as 81x -108y.

---------------

 Since x² + y² =16, we need to maximize 81x -108y under the constraint x² + y² =16. 

Alternatively

---------------

, this is a linear function over the circle x² + y²=16, so the maximum is the norm of the vector (81, -108) multiplied by the radius of

---------------

 the circle. Wait, yes, the maximum of ax + by on the circle x² + y² = r² is sqrt(a² + b²)*r. Let

---------------

 me verify:

The maximum of ax + by with x² + y² = r² is indeed sqrt(a² + b²)*r. 



---------------

So here, a=81, b=-108, and r=4. Wait, but the radius here

---------------

 is 4, but the circle equation is x² + y² =16 (since |z|=4). So

---------------

 yes, r²=16, so r=4. 

Therefore, the maximum value would be sqrt(81² + (-108)^2)*

---------------

4. Let me compute that. 

First compute 81 squared: 81² = 6561.

---------------

 108 squared: 108² = 11664. 

So sqrt(6561 + 11664) = sqrt(18225). Hmm

---------------

, sqrt(18225). Let me see, 135 squared is 18225 because

---------------

 100²=10,000, 130²=16,900, 135²= (130+5)^2 =130² + 2*130*5 +5² =16,900 +1,300 +25=18,225. So

---------------

 sqrt(18225)=135. 

Therefore, the maximum is 135 *4 = 540. Which

---------------

 matches the previous result. 

Therefore, regardless of the method, the maximum real part is 540. 

Therefore

---------------

, I can be confident that the answer is 540. 

Wait, but let me just think again, perhaps

---------------

 there's a step where I miscalculated the coefficients. Let me check the second approach again. 

In the first approach,

---------------

 when I used polar coordinates, the real part became 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. Then when

---------------

 I converted to rectangular coordinates, I had 81x -108y, and substituting x=4 cosθ and y=4 sinθ gives exactly

---------------

 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, so that's consistent. 

Alternatively, using Lagrange multipliers on

---------------

 the rectangular coordinates:

Maximize f(x,y)=81x -108y subject to g(x,y)=x² + y² -16=0.

Set up the Lagrangian: L =81x -108y -λ(x² + y² -16).



---------------

Taking partial derivatives:

dL/dx =81 - 2λx =0 → 81=2λx



---------------

dL/dy = -108 -2λy =0 → -108=2λy

dL/dλ= -(x² + y² -16)=0.



---------------

From first equation: λ=81/(2x)

From second equation: λ= -108/(2y)= -54/y

Therefore

---------------

, 81/(2x) = -54/y → cross multiply: 81 y = -54*2x → 81y = -108x → divide

---------------

 both sides by 27: 3y = -4x → y = (-4/3)x

Now,

---------------

 substitute into the constraint equation x² + y² =16.

x² + ( (16/9)x² ) =16 → x² (

---------------

1 +16/9)=16 → x²*(25/9)=16 → x²= (16)*(

---------------

9/25)= (144)/25 → x= ±12/5.

Thus, x=12/5 or x=-12/5.

If

---------------

 x=12/5, then y= (-4/3)*(12/5)= -16/5.

If

---------------

 x= -12/5, then y= (-4/3)*(-12/5)= 16/5.

Now

---------------

, compute f(x,y)=81x -108y for both points.

First, for x=12/5, y= -16/5:

81*(12/5) -108*(-16/5)= (972/5) + (1728/5)= (972 +1728)/5= 2700/5=540.

Second point:

---------------

 x=-12/5, y=16/5:

81*(-12/5) -108*(16/5)= (-972/5) - (1728/5)= (-2700)/5= -540.

Therefore

---------------

, the maximum is indeed 540, and the minimum is -540. So that's consistent with all

---------------

 methods. 

Therefore, the answer must be 540. 

I think I've checked this in multiple ways:

---------------

 polar coordinates, rectangular coordinates with substitution, Lagrange multipliers, and even calculus with derivatives. All lead to the same conclusion. Therefore

---------------

, I can be confident the largest possible real part is 540.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{540}


To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in polar form. Let \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\), so \(\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\).

Substituting \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) into the expression, we get:
\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}
\]
Simplifying each term:
\[
4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} \

---------------

quad \text{and} \quad (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Expanding these terms using Euler's formula \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\), we compute the real parts:


---------------

- For the first term \(4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta}\):
  \[
  4[(

---------------

75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + i(75\sin\theta + 117\cos\theta)]
  \]
  The real part is \(4(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta)\).

- For the second term \((24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}\):
  \[
  (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)
  \]
  The real part is \(24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta\).

Adding the real parts of both terms:
\[
4(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta)
\]
Simplifying:
\[
300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta
\]

To maximize \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\), we use the formula for the maximum value of \(A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta\), which is \(\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\):
\[
\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2}
\]
Calculating the values:
\[
324^2 = 104976 \quad \text{and} \quad 432^2 = 186624
\]
\[
\sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540
\]

Thus, the largest possible real part of the given expression is \(\boxed{540}\).<|im_end|>
