Okay, so I need to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again carefully.

We have points O(0,0), A(1/2, 0), and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The family F consists of all segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. There's a unique point C on segment AB, not A or B, that isn't part of any segment from F except AB itself. We need to find OC² as a reduced fraction p/q and then compute p + q.

Hmm. Let me try

---------------

 to visualize this. Points O, A, B form a triangle. Since O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis, and B is up the y-axis at

---------------

 sqrt(3)/2. The segment AB would then be the hypotenuse of this triangle. Let me confirm coordinates:



---------------

Point A is (1/2, 0), point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So the

---------------

 distance between A and B should be sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. Oh, so

---------------

 AB is actually a unit length segment? Wait, that's interesting. So AB is a unit length segment lying between the x and y axes,

---------------

 but not part of the family F because in F the segments have P on x-axis and Q on y-axis, so AB

---------------

 is from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2), so it's not starting on

---------------

 the axes? Wait, actually, the family F is all segments PQ where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis with

---------------

 PQ of unit length. So AB is not part of F because its endpoints are not on the axes except at A and B?

---------------

 Wait, A is on the x-axis and B is on the y-axis, so actually AB is a segment from the x-axis to the y-axis with

---------------

 unit length. Wait, hold on, is AB part of F? Because if AB is from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2), then

---------------

 it is a segment from the x-axis to the y-axis of length 1. So is AB considered part of F?

The

---------------

 problem says "the unique point C on AB... that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB". So that

---------------

 implies that AB is in F, and C is a point on AB such that the only segment in F that contains C is AB itself. So such

---------------

 a point C is unique and not A or B. We need to find OC².

So the key is to find a

---------------

 point C on AB (other than A and B) such that C is not on any other segment in F besides AB. So

---------------

, for every other segment PQ in F (other than AB), C is not on PQ. So, the point C must lie on AB,

---------------

 but not on any other PQ in F.

Therefore, to find such a point C, we need to ensure that for any other PQ

---------------

 in F (other than AB), the point C is not on PQ. Since C is on AB, perhaps we can param

---------------

etrize AB and then find a point where it's not lying on any other PQ except AB.

Let me parametrize AB first. Let me write

---------------

 the equation of AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the slope

---------------

 of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So

---------------

 y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2). So any point on AB can be written as (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2) where t ranges from 0 to 1/2. Wait

---------------

, when x=0, y=sqrt(3)/2 (point B) and when x=1/2, y=0 (point A). So yes

---------------

, t is the x-coordinate from 0 to 1/2.

Alternatively, we can parametrize using a parameter s

---------------

 from 0 to 1, where s=0 is at B and s=1 is at A. Let me see

---------------

:

Let’s let s go from 0 to 1. Then the coordinates would be x = (1/2)s, y = (sqrt(3)/2)(1 - s). Hmm

---------------

, maybe that's another way. But maybe using coordinates (t, y(t)) with t from 0 to 1/2 is okay

---------------

.

Now, the family F consists of all segments PQ of unit length with P on the x-axis (so P is (p, 0)) and Q on the y-axis (so Q is (0, q)), such

---------------

 that the distance between P and Q is 1. The distance PQ is sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, so p² + q² = 1. Therefore

---------------

, all such segments correspond to points (p,0) and (0,q) with p² + q² = 1 in

---------------

 the first quadrant. So for each such P(p,0) on the x-axis (with p between 0 and 1),

---------------

 there's a corresponding Q(0, sqrt(1 - p²)) on the y-axis, and vice versa.

Each

---------------

 such segment PQ is the line segment connecting (p,0) to (0, sqrt(1 - p²)). The

---------------

 problem is that we need to find a point C on AB (other than A and B) such that C is not on any of these segments except AB itself. So,

---------------

 in other words, for any other segment PQ in F (other than AB), C is not on PQ. Since AB itself is part

---------------

 of F (since when p = 1/2, then q must be sqrt(1 - (1/2)^2) = sqrt(3)/2, so indeed

---------------

 AB is the segment from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2), so AB is in

---------------

 F. Therefore, the point C is on AB, but not on any other PQ in F.

Therefore, the point C must lie on AB such

---------------

 that there is no other segment PQ in F passing through it except AB. So, to find such a point, perhaps we

---------------

 can set up equations where for a general point on AB, we can see if there exists another segment PQ in F that also

---------------

 passes through it.

Let me formalize this. Let’s suppose C is a point on AB. Let me write its coordinates as (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2) where

---------------

 t is between 0 and 1/2. We need to ensure that this point is not on any PQ in F except AB.

---------------

 So, for this point (t, y), there does not exist any p ≠ 1/2 (since when p = 1/2, it

---------------

's AB) such that the segment from (p,0) to (0, sqrt(1 - p²)) passes through (t, y).

Alternatively

---------------

, we can think of this as: for the point (t, y(t)), there exists no p ≠ 1/2 such that (t, y(t)) lies on the line segment

---------------

 between (p, 0) and (0, sqrt(1 - p²)). So we need to find t such that for

---------------

 all p in [0,1], except p =1/2, the point (t, y(t)) is not on the segment PQ

---------------

(p).

Alternatively, for each p ≠1/2, the point (t, y(t)) does not lie on the line connecting

---------------

 (p,0) and (0, sqrt(1 - p²)). But we need this to hold for all p except p=1/2.

---------------

 Wait, but maybe even stronger, the point must not lie on any other such segment. So the point C is such that for

---------------

 all p in [0,1], if the segment PQ(p) passes through C, then p must equal 1/2.

---------------

 So we need that for the coordinates (t, y(t)), the only p for which the line PQ(p) passes through (

---------------

t, y(t)) is p=1/2. Therefore, to ensure that, for all other p, the point is

---------------

 not on PQ(p).

So perhaps, for each p, the line PQ(p) can be parametrized. Let's param

---------------

etrize the line PQ(p). Let me see, the line from (p, 0) to (0, sqrt(1 - p²)). The parametric equations for

---------------

 this line can be written as:

x = p(1 - s)

y = sqrt(1 - p²) * s,

where s ranges from 0 to 1. When

---------------

 s=0, we are at (p,0); when s=1, we are at (0, sqrt(1 - p²)).

Alternatively, in

---------------

 slope-intercept form, the line PQ(p) has slope (sqrt(1 - p²) - 0)/(0 - p) = -sqrt(1 - p²)/p. So the equation is y = (-sqrt(1 - p²)/p)x + sqrt(1 - p²).

Wait

---------------

, let me confirm that. Starting from point (p,0), slope m = [sqrt(1 - p²) - 0]/[0 - p] = -sqrt(1 - p²)/p. So the

---------------

 equation is y = m(x - p). Plugging in:

y = (-sqrt(1 - p²)/p)(x - p) = (-sqrt(1 - p²)/p)x + sqrt(1 - p²). Yes

---------------

, that's correct.

So the equation of PQ(p) is y = (-sqrt(1 - p²)/p)x + sqrt(1 - p²).

Now

---------------

, the point C(t, y(t)) lies on AB, so y(t) = -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2. We

---------------

 want that for this point, the only p for which the equation above holds is p = 1/2. So substit

---------------

uting the coordinates of C into the line equation for PQ(p):

- sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 = [ - sqrt(1 - p²)/p ] * t + sqrt(1 - p²)



---------------

We need this equation to hold only when p = 1/2. For other values of p, this equation must not hold.

---------------

 To ensure that C is not on any other PQ(p), this equation must have only the solution p=1/2.

---------------

 Therefore, we need to set up this equation and find t such that the equation above only has p=1/2 as a solution. Let

---------------

's rearrange the equation.

Let me write the equation again:

- sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 = (-

---------------

 sqrt(1 - p²)/p ) * t + sqrt(1 - p²)

Let me move all terms to one side:

-

---------------

 sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 + (sqrt(1 - p²)/p) * t - sqrt(1 - p²) = 0

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 it's better to collect terms involving sqrt(1 - p²). Let me rearrange the original equation:

Left side: L

---------------

HS = -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2

Right side: RHS = (- sqrt(1 - p²)/p ) * t + sqrt(1 - p²)

Let

---------------

 me factor sqrt(1 - p²) on the RHS:

RHS = sqrt(1 - p²) [ -t/p + 1 ]

So

---------------

 equation becomes:

LHS = RHS

=> -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(1 - p²) ( -t/p + 1 )

Let me denote

---------------

 sqrt(1 - p²) as s for a moment, but maybe not necessary.

Alternatively, let me isolate sqrt(1 - p²):

Bring

---------------

 all terms except sqrt(1 - p²) to the left:

-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(1 - p²)( -t/p + 1 ) =0



---------------

Wait, perhaps better to rearrange the equation to solve for sqrt(1 - p²):

sqrt(1 - p²) (

---------------

 -t/p + 1 ) = - sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2

Therefore,

sqrt(1 - p²) = [ - sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ] / ( -t/p + 1 )

Hmm

---------------

, this is getting a bit messy, but maybe we can square both sides? Although we have to be careful with squaring,

---------------

 but perhaps this is a path.

Alternatively, let me consider this equation as an equation in p, given t. We want

---------------

 that for the particular t corresponding to point C, the only solution p is 1/2. So the equation should have p = 1/2 as the

---------------

 only solution.

Therefore, if we substitute p = 1/2 into the equation, it should hold, which it does because C

---------------

 is on AB which is part of F when p=1/2. So that's okay.

Now, to ensure that there

---------------

's no other p ≠1/2 that satisfies the equation for a given t, we can consider the equation as a function of p and set

---------------

 it so that the only solution is p=1/2. So perhaps we can set up the equation such that when we solve

---------------

 for p, the only solution is p=1/2. To do that, maybe the equation becomes an identity only at p=1/2, so

---------------

 the equation must have a double root there or something?

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of the point C as the intersection point of AB and another

---------------

 PQ(p), and to have only AB passing through C, the system of equations (the line AB and PQ(p)) must intersect

---------------

 only at AB, so for the point C, the two lines AB and PQ(p) coincide only when p=1/2.

---------------

 Wait, but that's not exactly the case because PQ(p) is a different line unless they are the same line. Since

---------------

 AB is PQ(1/2), so the only common point between AB and any other PQ(p) would be at C

---------------

 if C is unique. Wait, but perhaps the point C is where all the other PQ(p) lines are tangent to AB or something?

---------------

 Hmm, maybe another approach.

Alternatively, for the point C to lie only on AB among all PQ segments, then the system

---------------

 of equations (the line AB and PQ(p)) must have only one common solution (the point C) but only when p=

---------------

1/2. Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe the point C is such that for any other PQ(p), the line

---------------

 PQ(p) does not pass through C except when p=1/2. To ensure that, for the given point (t, y(t)), the

---------------

 equation we had before must have only p=1/2 as a solution. Let me consider the equation again:

- sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 = (-

---------------

 sqrt(1 - p²)/p ) * t + sqrt(1 - p²)

Let me rearrange terms to collect

---------------

 like terms. Let me move all terms to the left:

- sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 + (sqrt(1 - p²)/p )

---------------

 * t - sqrt(1 - p²) = 0

Factor terms with sqrt(1 - p²):

sqrt(1 - p²) [ t/p - 1 ] + (-

---------------

 sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ) = 0

Hmm, perhaps that's better. Let me denote

---------------

 sqrt(1 - p²) as S for simplicity. Then:

S*( t/p - 1 ) + ( - sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ) = 0

But

---------------

 S = sqrt(1 - p²). Let me see if I can write this equation in terms of p and t.

---------------

 Let me rearrange:

sqrt(1 - p²)*( t/p - 1 ) = sqrt(3) t - sqrt(3)/2

Let

---------------

 me square both sides to eliminate the square root. Although this may introduce extraneous solutions, but since we are looking for a

---------------

 condition where p=1/2 is the only solution, maybe this can help.

So:

[ sqrt(1 - p²)*( t/p - 1 ) ]^2 = [ sqrt(3) t - sqrt(3)/2 ]^2

Left

---------------

 side:

(1 - p²)*( t/p - 1 )²

Right side:

3(t - 1/2)^2

So

---------------

 expanding left side:

(1 - p²)*( (t/p - 1)^2 )

First compute (t/p - 1)^2:

= ( (t - p)/p )^2 = (t - p)^2 / p²

Therefore

---------------

, left side becomes:

(1 - p²)*( (t - p)^2 ) / p²

So overall equation:

(1 - p²)(t - p)^2 / p² = 3(t - 1/2)^2

Hmm

---------------

. So this equation must hold only when p=1/2. Let me plug p=1/2 into the equation to see

---------------

 if it's valid.

Let me compute left side with p=1/2:

(1 - (1/2)^2)*( t - 1/2 )^2 / ( (1/2)^2 )

= (3/4)*( t

---------------

 - 1/2 )² / (1/4 )

= 3*(t - 1/2)^2

Right side:

---------------

 3(t - 1/2)^2

So indeed, when p=1/2, the equation holds,

---------------

 which is consistent. Now, we need that this equation has p=1/2 as the only solution for a specific t. So

---------------

, to find t such that when we solve the equation (1 - p²)(t - p)^2 / p² = 3(t - 1/2)^2 for p, the only solution is p=1/2.

Therefore

---------------

, we need that the equation above can be factored such that (p - 1/2) is a double root or the

---------------

 only root. Let me consider the equation as a function of p, set it equal to zero (by bringing all terms to one side)

---------------

 and find conditions on t such that the only root is p=1/2.

Alternatively, let's rearrange the equation:



---------------

(1 - p²)(t - p)^2 = 3 p² (t - 1/2)^2

Let

---------------

 me expand both sides:

Left side: (1 - p²)(t - p)^2

First, expand (t - p)^2 =

---------------

 t² - 2tp + p²

Multiply by (1 - p²):

(1 - p²)(t² - 2tp + p²) = (t² - 2tp + p²) - p²(t² - 2tp + p²)

= t² - 2tp + p² - p² t² + 2 t p^3 - p^4

Hmm, this

---------------

 might get too complicated. Alternatively, maybe consider this as a quadratic in p? Let me see.

Alternatively, let me consider

---------------

 that for the equation to have p=1/2 as the only solution, when we plug in p=1/2, the

---------------

 equation is satisfied, and the derivative with respect to p at p=1/2 is zero (so it's a double root). That

---------------

 way, p=1/2 is a double root, so it's the only solution. That might be the approach.



---------------

Let me denote the left side minus the right side as a function F(p,t):

F(p,t) = (1 - p²)(t - p)^2 / p² - 3(t - 1/2)^2 = 0

Wait

---------------

, actually, in the equation above, we had:

(1 - p²)(t - p)^2 / p² - 3(t - 1/2)^2 = 0

So

---------------

 F(p,t) = 0.

To have p=1/2 as a double root, the function F(p,t) must satisfy F(1/2,t)=0 and d

---------------

F/dp at p=1/2 is 0.

This is a common technique in algebra to ensure a double root.



---------------

So let me compute F(p,t) and its derivative.

First, let me write F(p,t):

F(p,t) = [(

---------------

1 - p²)(t - p)^2 / p² ] - 3(t - 1/2)^2 = 0

First

---------------

, compute F(1/2, t):

Plugging p=1/2:

F(1/2, t) = [ (1 - (1/2)^2)(

---------------

t - 1/2)^2 / ( (1/2)^2 ) ] - 3(t - 1/2)^2

Compute

---------------

 each term:

First term:

(3/4)*(t - 1/2)^2 / (1/4) = 3*(t - 1/2)^2

Second term: 3*(t - 1/2)^2

Thus

---------------

, F(1/2,t) = 3*(t - 1/2)^2 - 3*(t - 1/2)^2 = 0, which checks

---------------

 out.

Now compute the derivative dF/dp at p=1/2.

First, need to find derivative of F with respect to p:



---------------

dF/dp = d/dp [ (1 - p²)(t - p)^2 / p² ] - d/dp [ 3(t - 1/2)^2 ]

The

---------------

 second term is zero since it doesn't depend on p. So focus on the first part.

Let me denote the first term as G

---------------

(p,t) = (1 - p²)(t - p)^2 / p².

Compute derivative G’(p):

Use quotient rule or product rule. Let me write G

---------------

(p) as [(1 - p²)(t - p)^2] * p^{-2}

Use logarithmic differentiation or

---------------

 product rule.

Alternatively, let me use product rule:

Let me write G(p) = (1 - p²)(t - p)^2 * p^{-2}

Let

---------------

 me compute derivative term by term.

Let me denote u = (1 - p²), v = (t - p)^2, w = p^{-2}

Then G = u*v*w



---------------

Thus,

G’ = u’ v w + u v’ w + u v w’

Compute each term:

First term: u’ = -2p,

---------------

 so:

-2p * (t - p)^2 * p^{-2} = -2p * (t - p)^2 / p² = -2 (t - p)^2 / p

Second term: v’ = 2(t - p)(-1) = -2(t - p).

---------------

 Thus:

u * (-2(t - p)) * p^{-2} = (1 - p²)*(-2)(t - p) * p^{-2}

Third term: w’ = -2 p^{-3}



---------------

Thus:

u * v * (-2 p^{-3}) = (1 - p²)(t - p)^2*(-

---------------

2)/p^3

So putting all together:

G’ = [ -2(t - p)^2 / p ] + [ -2(1 - p²)(t - p)/p² ] + [ -2(1 - p²)(t - p)^2 / p^3 ]

Therefore

---------------

, the derivative dF/dp at p=1/2 is G’(1/2, t).

This looks

---------------

 complicated. Maybe instead of going through this derivative, let me consider another approach.

Alternatively, since we want the equation (1 - p²)(t - p)^2 = 3 p² (t - 1/2)^2 to have p =1/2 as the only solution, so

---------------

 when we treat this as an equation in p, the equation must have a double root at p=1/2. Therefore

---------------

, the equation can be written as (p - 1/2)^2 * something = 0. Therefore, expanding

---------------

 the equation and setting coefficients so that (p -1/2)^2 is a factor.

Let me try expanding both sides.



---------------

Left side: (1 - p²)(t - p)^2

First expand (t - p)^2 = t² - 2tp + p²

Multiply by (1 - p²):

(1 - p²)(t² - 2tp + p²) = (t² - 2tp + p²) - p²(t² - 2tp + p²)

= t² - 2tp + p² - p² t² + 2 t p^3 - p^4

Right

---------------

 side: 3 p² (t - 1/2)^2

Expand (t -1/2)^2 = t² - t + 1/4, so:



---------------

3 p² (t² - t + 1/4) = 3 p² t² - 3 p² t + (3/4) p²

So

---------------

 setting left side equal to right side:

Left Side: t² - 2tp + p² - p² t² + 2 t p^3 - p^4

Right Side: 3 p² t² - 3 p² t + (3/4) p²

Bring all terms to left:

t² - 2tp + p² - p² t² + 2 t p^3 - p^4 - 3 p² t² + 3 p² t - (3/4) p² = 0

Let

---------------

 me combine like terms term by term:

Terms with t²:

t² - p² t² - 3 p² t² = t² - t²(p

---------------

² + 3 p²) = t² - t²*(4 p²) = t²(1 - 4 p²)

Terms with t:



---------------

-2tp + 3 p² t = t(-2p + 3 p²)

Terms with p²:

p² - (3/4)p² = (1 - 3/4)p² = (1/4)p²

Terms with p^3:

+2 t p^3

Terms with p^4:

- p^4

So

---------------

 overall equation:

t²(1 - 4 p²) + t(-2p + 3 p²) + (1/4)p² + 2 t p^3 - p^4 = 0

Hmm, this is getting

---------------

 really complicated. Maybe there is a smarter way.

Wait, since we want the equation to have p=1/2 as a double root, then

---------------

 (p - 1/2)^2 must be a factor of the polynomial equation when rearranged to 0. Let

---------------

 me consider that.

Let me denote the equation as:

Left Side - Right Side = 0.

Wait, perhaps better to consider

---------------

 the equation as a polynomial in p. Let me rearrange the equation again.

Original equation after moving everything to left:

t

---------------

² - 2tp + p² - p² t² + 2 t p^3 - p^4 - 3 p² t² + 3 p² t - (3/4) p² = 0

Let

---------------

 me collect terms by powers of p:

Start with the highest power of p, which is p^4:

- p^4

Then p^3 terms: 2 t p^3

p^2 terms:

-

---------------

 p² t² (from -p² t²) + (-3 p² t² from -3 p² t²) + 

---------------

3 p² t (from 3 p² t) + p² (from p²) - (3/4)p² (from - (3/4)p²)



---------------

Wait, let's do term by term:

Looking for terms with p^4: -p^4

p^3: +2 t p^3

p^2 terms:

-

---------------

 p² t² (from first expansion)

-3 p² t² (from the -3 p² t² term)

+3

---------------

 p² t (from 3 p² t)

+p² (from p² term)

- (3/4) p² (from the

---------------

 - (3/4)p² term)

Wait, so combining p^2 terms:

- p² t² - 3 p² t² = -4 p² t²

Then

---------------

 the rest: 3 p² t + p² - (3/4)p² = 3 p² t + (1 - 3/4)p² = 3 p² t + (1/4)p²

So

---------------

 p^2 terms: -4 p² t² + 3 p² t + (1/4)p²

Then

---------------

 p terms:

From -2tp (from the -2tp term)

So that's -2 t p

Then the

---------------

 remaining terms:

The t² term: t² (from the first term)

and the constants? There are no constant terms except t

---------------

².

So putting all together:

Equation is:

- p^4 + 2 t p^3 + [ -4 t² p² + 3 t p² + (1/4)p² ] + ( -2 t p ) + t² = 0

Let

---------------

 me factor terms with p²:

In the p² terms:

-4 t² p² + 3 t p² + (1/4)p² = p²(-

---------------

4 t² + 3 t + 1/4 )

Similarly, the p terms: -2 t p

So

---------------

 overall equation:

- p^4 + 2 t p^3 + p²(-4 t² + 3 t + 1/4 ) - 2 t p + t² = 0

This is a quartic equation in p. For

---------------

 p =1/2 to be a double root, (p -1/2)^2 must divide this quartic.

---------------

 Let me denote p =1/2 is a root, and so is another root? Wait, but we want it to be a double root.

---------------

 So (p -1/2)^2 is a factor. Let me suppose that.

Let me denote the quartic as Q(p) = - p^4 + 2 t p^3 + p

---------------

²(-4 t² + 3 t + 1/4 ) - 2 t p + t²

We

---------------

 need Q(1/2)=0 and Q’(1/2)=0.

We already know Q(1/2)=0,

---------------

 since we had the original equation holds at p=1/2. Now compute Q’(p):

Q’(p) = -4 p^3 + 6 t p^2 + [

---------------

2 p (-4 t² + 3 t + 1/4 ) ] + (-2 t )

Evaluate Q’(1/2):



---------------

First, compute each term at p=1/2:

First term: -4*(1/2)^3 = -4*(1/8) = -0.5

Second term: 6 t*(1/2)^2 = 6 t*(1/4) = (3/2) t

Third term: 2*(1/2)*(-4 t² + 3 t + 1/4 ) = (1)*(-4 t² + 3 t + 1/4 )

Fourth term: -2 t

So

---------------

 altogether:

Q’(1/2) = -0.5 + (3/2)t + (-4 t² + 3 t + 1/4 ) - 2 t

Combine

---------------

 terms:

Constants: -0.5 + 1/4 = -0.25

t terms: (3/2)t + 3t - 2t = (3/2 + 

---------------

3 - 2)t = (3/2 +1 ) t = (5/2)t

t² terms: -4 t²

So overall

---------------

:

Q’(1/2) = -4 t² + (5/2) t - 0.25

Set

---------------

 this equal to zero for the double root condition:

-4 t² + (5/2) t - 0.25 =0

Multiply both

---------------

 sides by 4 to eliminate decimals:

-16 t² + 10 t -1 =0

Multiply by -1:

16 t² -10 t +1 =0

Solve for t:

t = [10 ± sqrt(100 - 64)] / 32

sqrt

---------------

(36) =6

Thus,

t=(10 ±6)/32

So two solutions:

t=(10+6)/32 =16/32=1/2,



---------------

t=(10-6)/32=4/32=1/8

But t is the x-coordinate along

---------------

 AB from 0 to 1/2, so t=1/2 would correspond to point A, which is excluded. So

---------------

 the other solution is t=1/8.

Therefore, t=1/8 is the value where the derivative is zero, so

---------------

 p=1/2 is a double root, which would mean that for t=1/8, the equation has p=1/2 as a double root, hence

---------------

 the only solution. Therefore, the point C is at t=1/8 on AB.

Wait, but let me verify this

---------------

. Let me check if with t=1/8, the equation only has p=1/2 as a solution.

So

---------------

 let me substitute t=1/8 into the original equation and see if p=1/2 is the only solution.

Original

---------------

 equation after substitution:

- sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = [ - sqrt(1 - p²)/p ]*(1/8) + sqrt(1 - p²)

Let

---------------

 me compute left side:

Left Side: - (sqrt(3)/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)*( -1/8 + 4/8 ) = sqrt(3)*(3/8) = (3 sqrt(3))/8

Right Side: sqrt(1 - p²)*( -1/(8p) +1 )

Set

---------------

 equal:

(3 sqrt(3))/8 = sqrt(1 - p²)*(1 - 1/(8p))

We

---------------

 need to see if this equation has only p=1/2 as solution.

Let me test p=1/2:

sqrt

---------------

(1 - (1/2)^2 ) = sqrt(3)/2,

then RHS: (sqrt(3)/2)*(1 - 1/(8*(1/2))) = (sqrt(3)/2)*(1 - 1/4) = (sqrt(3)/2)*(3/4)= (3 sqrt(3))/8,

---------------

 which matches the left side. Good.

Now, suppose there is another solution p ≠1/2. Let me suppose p is

---------------

 some other value.

Let me rearrange the equation:

sqrt(1 - p²) = (3 sqrt(3)/8) / [1 - 1/(8p) ]

Let

---------------

 me compute denominator:

1 - 1/(8p) = (8p -1)/(8p)

Thus,

sqrt(1 - p²) = (3 sqrt(3)/8) * (8p)/(8p -1) ) = (3 sqrt(3) p )

---------------

/(8p -1 )

Therefore,

sqrt(1 - p²) = (3 sqrt(3) p)/(8p -1 )

Now square both sides:

1 - p² = (27 p²)/(8p -1)^2

Multiply both sides by (8p -1)^2:

(1 - p²)(8p -1)^2 = 27 p²

Expand

---------------

 left side:

First compute (8p -1)^2 = 64 p² -16 p +1

Multiply by (1 - p²):

(1 - p²)(64 p² -16 p +1 )



---------------

= 64 p² -16 p +1 -64 p^4 +16 p^3 - p²

=

---------------

 -64 p^4 +16 p^3 + (64 p² - p²) -16 p +1

= -64 p^4 +16 p^3 +63 p² -16 p +1

Set equal to 27 p²:

-64 p^4 +16 p^3 +63 p² -16 p +1 =27 p²

Bring all terms to left:

-64 p^4 +16 p^3 + (63 p

---------------

² -27 p²) -16 p +1 =0

Simplify:

-64 p^4 +16 p^3 +36 p² -16 p +1 =0

Multiply

---------------

 both sides by -1:

64 p^4 -16 p^3 -36 p² +16 p -1 =0

Hmm

---------------

, need to factor this quartic equation. Let me see if p=1/2 is a root:

Plug p=1/2:

64*(1/2)^4 -16*(1/2)^3 -36*(1/2)^2 +16*(1/2) -1

=64*(1/16) -16*(1/8) -36*(1/4) +8 -1

=4 -2 -9 +8 -1= (4-2)

---------------

 + (-9+8) -1= 2 -1 -1=0. Yes, so p=1/2 is a root.

Div

---------------

ide the quartic by (p -1/2). Let me use polynomial division.

Let me write the quartic as 64 p^4 -16 p^3 -36 p² +16 p -1



---------------

Divide by (p -1/2). Alternatively, use synthetic division with p=1/2.

Coefficients: 64, -16, -36,16, -1

Write

---------------

 synthetic division:

1/2 | 64   -16   -36   16   -1
      |     32     8    -14   1
      ---------------------------
        64     16    -28   2     0

So the quartic factors as (p -1/2)(64 p^3 +16 p² -28 p +2 )



---------------

Now, set the cubic equal to zero: 64 p³ +16 p² -28 p +2 =0

Let

---------------

 me see if p=1/2 is again a root:

64*(1/2)^3 +16*(1/2)^2 -28*(1/2)+2



---------------

=64*(1/8) +16*(1/4) -14 +2

=8 +4 -14 +2=0. So yes, p

---------------

=1/2 is a double root.

Therefore, factor out another (p -1/2):

Divide 64 p³ +16 p² -28 p +2 by (p -1/2).

---------------

 Using synthetic division again with p=1/2:

Coefficients:64,16,-28,2

1/2 | 64   16   -28   2
    |     32   24   -2
    ---------------------


---------------

      64   48   -4   0

So the cubic factors as (p -1/2)(64 p² +48 p -4 )

Thus

---------------

, the quartic factors as (p -1/2)^2 (64 p² +48 p -4 )



---------------

Set equal to zero:

(p -1/2)^2 (64 p² +48 p -4 ) =0

Thus

---------------

, solutions are p=1/2 (double root), and roots of 64 p² +48 p -4 =0.

Solve 64 p² +48 p -4 =0:

Disc

---------------

riminant D= 48² +4*64*4 = 2304 + 1024= 3328



---------------

Wait sqrt(3328). Let me compute:

3328 divided by 16 is 208, which

---------------

 is 16*13, so sqrt(3328)=sqrt(16*208)=4*sqrt(208)=4*sqrt(16*13)=4*4*sqrt(13)=16 sqrt

---------------

(13). Wait, 208 is 16*13, so sqrt(208)=4 sqrt

---------------

(13), so sqrt(3328)= sqrt(16*208)=4*sqrt(208)=4*4 sqrt13=16 sqrt13?

---------------

 Wait, 16*208=3328, so sqrt(3328)=sqrt(16*208)=4*sqrt(208). Hmm

---------------

, 208=16*13, so sqrt(208)=4 sqrt13. So

---------------

 sqrt(3328)=4*(4 sqrt13)=16 sqrt13.

Therefore,

p = [ -48 ±16 sqrt(13) ] / (2*64)

---------------

 = [ -48 ±16 sqrt13 ] / 128 = [ -3 ± sqrt(13) ] /8

So

---------------

 the roots are p= [ -3 + sqrt(13) ] /8 and p= [ -3 - sqrt(13) ] /8



---------------

But since p is between 0 and1 (as it's the x-coordinate of P on the x-axis), let's see

---------------

 the values:

sqrt(13) ≈3.6055, so [ -3 +3.6055 ] /

---------------

8 ≈0.6055/8≈0.0757, which is between 0 and1.



---------------

The other root is negative, so discard. So the other roots are p≈0.0757 and p=1/2 (double root).

Therefore

---------------

, when t=1/8, the equation has p=1/2 (double root) and p≈0.0757. Wait a second, so

---------------

 that means there is another solution p≈0.0757, which is different from 1/2, which

---------------

 would mean that the point C at t=1/8 would lie on another PQ(p) segment with p≈0.0757,

---------------

 which contradicts the requirement that C is only on AB.

Hmm, so that suggests that my assumption that t=1/8 is

---------------

 the solution is incorrect? But according to the earlier condition, when we set the derivative to zero, we found t=1/8.

---------------

 However, in reality, when we plug t=1/8, there is another solution p≈0.0757,

---------------

 so that point C is on another PQ(p), so it's not valid.

Wait, this is a problem. Did I make a mistake?



---------------

Wait, so perhaps my approach was wrong. Let me think again.

The problem is that when I required that p=1/2 is a double root, that

---------------

 only eliminates one other root, but there might still be another real root. So perhaps my approach is insufficient.

Alternatively, maybe I

---------------

 need to set the quartic equation to have p=1/2 as a quadruple root? But that might be overkill.

Alternatively, perhaps the

---------------

 correct approach is to consider that for the point C, the line AB and any PQ(p) intersect only at C when p=1/2,

---------------

 so that C is the only intersection point between AB and PQ(p) for any p≠1/2. So the system

---------------

 of equations of AB and PQ(p) must have only the solution C when p≠1/2.

Wait, the lines

---------------

 AB and PQ(p) intersect at some point. For p≠1/2, we want that intersection point to not be on AB except at C.

---------------

 Wait, but every PQ(p) intersects AB at some point. So the only common point between AB and any PQ(p) other

---------------

 than AB itself must not be C. Wait, maybe the point C is the only point on AB that is not on any other PQ(p).

---------------

 Therefore, all other points on AB are on some other PQ(p).

Therefore, to have C as the unique point (other than A and B) not

---------------

 on any other PQ(p), it must be that for every other point on AB (other than A,B,C), there is some PQ(p) passing

---------------

 through it. And C is the only exception.

Therefore, to find C, we need that C is the only point on AB (other

---------------

 than A,B) where the system of equations of AB and PQ(p) has only p=1/2 as solution.

---------------

 So perhaps the point C is where the lines PQ(p) are tangent to AB? That is, the line PQ(p) is tangent to AB at point C,

---------------

 so that they only meet at C. That would make sense because tangency would mean only one intersection point, so for that particular

---------------

 p, the line PQ(p) touches AB only at C, and for other p's, they might intersect at another point.

---------------

 Wait, but tangency would require that the line PQ(p) is tangent to AB at C, so there exists a p such

---------------

 that PQ(p) is tangent to AB at C, and for all other p's, the line PQ(p) doesn't pass through C.

---------------

 Hmm, perhaps this is the case?

If that is the case, then we can find the point C where the line PQ(p) is tangent to AB,

---------------

 which would give a unique p and hence a unique point C. Let's try this approach.

Let me suppose that there exists a p

---------------

 such that the line PQ(p) is tangent to AB at point C. Then, the line PQ(p) touches AB only at C, and

---------------

 for any other p', the line PQ(p') would intersect AB at another point. So the point C is the only point on

---------------

 AB where such a tangent exists, and thus C is not on any other PQ(p') except the tangent one (which is AB

---------------

 itself when p=1/2). Wait, but PQ(p) when tangent would be a different segment unless p=1/2.



---------------

Wait, actually, the tangent line would have to coincide with AB only when p=1/2. Wait, no.

---------------

 The tangent line would be a different line unless it's AB itself.

Hmm, perhaps the idea is that the point C is where the

---------------

 envelope of all the PQ(p) lines touches AB, so that it's the only point where the envelope meets AB, hence

---------------

 C is not on any PQ(p) except AB.

Alternatively, maybe the point C is the point where the family of lines PQ(p) have

---------------

 a common point other than A and B. But the problem states that C is not on any other PQ(p) except AB,

---------------

 so it's the only point not on any other PQ(p).

Alternatively, perhaps C is the point where the two lines AB

---------------

 and the envelope of the family F meet. The envelope of the family of lines PQ(p) would form a curve, and the

---------------

 point C is where this envelope intersects AB, so that beyond that point, the lines don't intersect AB anymore except at C.

---------------

 Hmm, this might be a direction.

Let me recall that the envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. To find the envelope of the lines PQ(p), we

---------------

 can use calculus.

The envelope of the lines PQ(p) can be found by solving the equations:

F(p, x, y) = 0,

dF/dp =0,

where F(p,x,y) is the equation of the line PQ(p).

The

---------------

 equation of PQ(p) is y = (-sqrt(1 - p²)/p)x + sqrt(1 - p²).



---------------

Let me write this as:

y + (sqrt(1 - p²)/p)x - sqrt(1 - p²) =0



---------------

Let me denote F(p, x, y)= y + (sqrt(1 - p²)/p)x - sqrt(1 - p²)=

---------------

0

To find the envelope, we take the partial derivative of F with respect to p and set it to zero.

Compute ∂F/∂p:

First term: derivative of y with

---------------

 respect to p is 0.

Second term: derivative of [sqrt(1 - p²)/p * x] with respect to p.

Let me denote term

---------------

2 = sqrt(1 - p²)/p *x.

Let me compute derivative:

d/dp [ sqrt(1 - p²)/p ] * x

Let me compute

---------------

 derivative of sqrt(1 - p²)/p:

Let f(p)=sqrt(1 - p²)/p.

f’(p)= [ ( (-p)/sqrt(1 - p²) )*p - sqrt(1 - p²)*1 ] / p²

Using

---------------

 quotient rule: d/dp [numerator/denominator] where numerator = sqrt(1 - p²), denominator = p.

Thus

---------------

:

f’(p) = [ ( (-p)/sqrt(1 - p²) )*p - sqrt(1 - p²)*1 ] / p²

Simplify numerator:

First

---------------

 term: (-p²)/sqrt(1 - p²)

Second term: - sqrt(1 - p²)

So

---------------

 total numerator:

[ -p² / sqrt(1 - p²) - sqrt(1 - p²) ] = - [ p² + (1 - p²) ] / sqrt(1 - p²) )

---------------

 = - [1]/sqrt(1 - p²)

Thus,

f’(p) = -1 / [ p² sqrt(1 - p²) ]

Therefore, derivative of term2 is f’(p)*x = -x / [ p² sqrt(1 - p²) ]

Third term: derivative of -sqrt(1 - p²):

d

---------------

/dp [ -sqrt(1 - p²) ] = - [ (-p)/sqrt(1 - p²) ] = p / sqrt(1 - p²)

Putting

---------------

 all together,

∂F/∂p = [ -x / ( p² sqrt(1 - p²) ) ] + [ p / sqrt(1 - p²) ] =0

Set

---------------

 derivative equal to zero:

- x / ( p² sqrt(1 - p²) ) + p / sqrt(1 - p²) =0

Multiply both sides by sqrt(1 - p²):

- x / p² + p =0

Thus

---------------

,

- x / p² + p =0 → p^3 =x → x= p^3

So from the envelope condition, x= p^3.

Now, substitute

---------------

 x= p^3 into the original line equation F(p,x,y)=0:

y + (sqrt(1 - p²)/p)*

---------------

x - sqrt(1 - p²)=0

Substitute x=p^3:

y + (sqrt(1 - p²)/p)*p^3 - sqrt(1 - p²) =0

Simplify:

y + p^2 sqrt(1 - p²) - sqrt(1 - p²)=0

Factor sqrt(1 - p²):

sqrt(1 - p²)(p² -1) + y=0 → sqrt

---------------

(1 - p²)( - (1 - p²) ) + y=0 → - (1 - p²)^{3/2} + y =0 → y= (1 - p²)^{3/2}

Therefore, the envelope curve

---------------

 is given parametrically by x= p^3, y=(1 - p²)^{3/2}

So

---------------

 the envelope is the set of points (p^3, (1 - p²)^{3/2} ) for p in (0,1).



---------------

Now, the point C is where this envelope intersects the segment AB. Because at that point, the envelope is tangent to AB, meaning that beyond

---------------

 that point, the lines PQ(p) do not intersect AB except at C. Therefore, the point C is the intersection of AB and the envelope.

So

---------------

 let's find the intersection between AB and the envelope.

The envelope parametric equations are x= p^3, y=(1 - p²)^{3/2}

The equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2

So

---------------

 set (1 - p²)^{3/2} = -sqrt(3) p^3 + sqrt(3)/2

Let me denote this

---------------

 equation:

(1 - p²)^{3/2} + sqrt(3) p^3 - sqrt(3)/2 =0

This equation

---------------

 needs to be solved for p in (0,1). Let's attempt to find p such that this holds.

Let me make

---------------

 a substitution. Let me set p = sinθ, since 1 - p² = cos²θ, but maybe that

---------------

 complicates. Alternatively, let me try plugging in p=1/2, since we know AB is part of the family.



---------------

If p=1/2,

Left side: (1 - (1/2)^2)^{3/2} + sqrt(3)*(1/2)^3 - sqrt(3)/2

= (3/4)^{3/2} + sqrt(3)/8 - sqrt(3)/2

Compute

---------------

 (3/4)^{3/2} = (sqrt(3)/2)^3 = (3 sqrt(3))/8

So total

---------------

 left side:

3 sqrt(3)/8 + sqrt(3)/8 -4 sqrt(3)/8 = (3+1-4)/8 sqrt(3) =0. So p=1/2 is a solution, which makes

---------------

 sense since the envelope should touch AB at AB itself. But we need another intersection point.

Let me look for another p.

---------------

 Let me suppose p is something else.

Let me let’s try p =1/ something. Let me suppose p=1/√

---------------

3 ≈0.577, but that's larger than 1/2.

Wait, let me try p=1/2 is

---------------

 already one solution. Let me try p=1/ something else. Let me try p=1/√2 ≈0.707,

---------------

 but that might not work.

Alternatively, perhaps let me set t=p^3 and see.

Alternatively, let me consider the

---------------

 equation:

(1 - p²)^{3/2} = sqrt(3) ( (sqrt(3)/2 - y )

---------------

 / sqrt(3) ) but maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, let me square both sides to eliminate the square roots, but need

---------------

 to be cautious.

Let me rearrange the equation:

(1 - p²)^{3/2} = sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) p^3

Let me denote RHS

---------------

 as sqrt(3)(1/2 - p^3)

Square both sides:

(1 - p²)^3 = 3 (1/2 - p^3)^2

Expand both sides:

Left side: (1 - p²)^3 =1 - 3 p² + 3 p^4 - p^6

Right side: 3*(1/4 - p^3 + p^6) = 3/4 - 3 p^3 +3 p^6

Set equation:

1 -3 p² +3 p^4 -p^6 = 3/4 -3 p^3 +3 p^6

Bring all terms to left:

1 -3 p² +3 p^4 -p^6 -3/4 +3 p^3 -3 p^6 =0

Combine like terms:

Constants:1 - 3/4 =1/4

p terms: no

---------------

 p term.

p² terms: -3 p²

p^3 terms: +3 p^3

p^4 terms:+3 p^4

p^6 terms: -p^6 -3 p^6= -4 p^6

Thus:



---------------

-4 p^6 +3 p^4 +3 p^3 -3 p² +1/4=0

Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate fraction:

-16 p^6 +12 p^4 +12 p^3 -12 p² +1=0

Hmm, this is a sixth-degree equation.

---------------

 This is quite complicated. Perhaps there's a substitution.

Let me see if p=1/2 is a root:

Plug p=1/2:

-16*(1/64) +12*(1/16)+12*(1/8)-12*(1/4)+1

= -0.25 + 0.75 +1.5 -3 +1 =



---------------

(-0.25 +0.75)=0.5; (0.5 +1.5)=2; (2 -3)= -1; (-1 +1)=0. So yes, p=1/2 is a root.

Therefore

---------------

, (p -1/2) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division.

Let me write the polynomial as:

-16 p^6 +12 p^4 +12 p^3 -12 p^2 +1



---------------

Divide by (p -1/2). Using synthetic division:

But since it's a sixth-degree, maybe better to use

---------------

 substitution. Alternatively, factor step by step.

Alternatively, since p=1/2 is a root, let me factor (p -1/2).



---------------

Let me write the polynomial as:

Let me denote Q(p)= -16 p^6 +12 p^4 +12 p^3 -12 p^2 +1

We

---------------

 can write Q(p) = (p -1/2)*something.

Let me use polynomial long division.

Divide Q(p) by (p -1/2).



---------------

Start with -16 p^6 divided by p gives -16 p^5. Multiply (p -1/2) by -16 p^5:



---------------

-16 p^6 +8 p^5

Subtract from Q(p):

(-16 p^6 +12 p^4 +12 p^3 -12 p^2 +1 ) - (-16 p^6 +8 p^5)

---------------

 = 8 p^5 +12 p^4 +12 p^3 -12 p^2 +1

Next term: 8 p^5 divided by p is 8 p^4. Multiply (p -1/2) by 8 p^4:

---------------

 8 p^5 -4 p^4

Subtract:

(8 p^5 +12 p^4 +...)

---------------

 - (8 p^5 -4 p^4)=16 p^4 +12 p^3 -12 p^2 +1

Next term:16 p^4 /p =16 p^3. Multiply (p -1/2) by16 p^3:16 p^4 -8 p^3

Subtract:

(16 p^4 +12 p^3 -

---------------

12 p^2 +1) - (16 p^4 -8 p^3)=20 p^3 -12 p^2 +1

Next term:20 p^3 /p=20 p^2. Multiply (p -1/2) by20 p^2:20 p^3 -10 p^2

Subtract:

(20 p^3 -12 p^2 +1) - (20 p^3 -10 p^2)= -2 p^2 +1

Next term: -2 p^2 /p= -2 p. Multiply (p -1/2)

---------------

 by-2 p: -2 p^2 + p

Subtract:

(-2 p^2 +1 ) - (-2 p^2 + p)= -p +1

Next term: -p/p = -1. Multiply (p -1/2) by-1: -p +1/2

Subtract:

(-p +1 ) - (-p +1/2)=1 -1/2=1/2

So

---------------

 the division gives:

Q(p)= (p -1/2)(-16 p^5 +8 p^4 +16 p^3 +20 p^2 -2 p -2 ) +1/2

Wait

---------------

, but there is a remainder of 1/2, which suggests an error because we knew p=1/2 is a root. Maybe

---------------

 I made a calculation mistake during the division.

Alternatively, perhaps better to use synthetic division for p=1/2.

Let

---------------

 me write the coefficients of Q(p):

-16 p^6 +0 p^5 +12 p^4 +12 p^3 -12 p^2 +0 p +1

Coeff

---------------

icients: -16, 0,12,12,-12,0,1

Divide by (p -1/2).

---------------

 Using synthetic division with root 1/2:

Bring down -16

Multiply by 1/2: -8

Add to next term:0 + (-8)= -8

Multiply by1/2: -4

Add to next term:12 + (-4)=8

Multiply by1/2:4

Add to next term:12 +4=16

Multiply by1/2:8

Add to next term:-12 +8= -4

Multiply by1/2: -2

Add to next term:0 + (-2)= -2

Multiply by1/2: -1

Add to last term:1 + (-1)=0. Perfect

---------------

.

So the coefficients after division are:

-16, -8,8,16, -4, -2



---------------

Thus, the quotient polynomial is:

-16 p^5 -8 p^4 +8 p^3 +16 p^2 -4 p -2

Therefore

---------------

,

Q(p)=(p -1/2)( -16 p^5 -8 p^4 +8 p^3 +16 p^2 -4 p -2 )

Now,

---------------

 need to factor the quintic. Hmm, this is still complicated. Let me check if p=1/2 is again

---------------

 a root of the quintic:

Plug p=1/2 into quintic:

-16*(1/32) -8*(1/16)+8*(1/8)+16*(1/4)-4*(1/2)-2

= -0.5 -0.5 +1 +4 -2 -2 =



---------------

(-0.5 -0.5)= -1; (-1 +1)=0; (0 +4)=4; (4-2)=2; (2-2)=0. So p=1/2 is also

---------------

 a root of the quintic.

Thus, factor out another (p -1/2):

Divide the quintic by

---------------

 (p -1/2). The quintic is:

-16 p^5 -8 p^4 +8 p^3 +16 p^2 -4 p -2

Using

---------------

 synthetic division with p=1/2:

Coefficients: -16, -8,8,16,-4,-2

Bring down -16

Multiply by1/2: -8

Add to next term: -8 + (-8)= -16

Multiply by1/2: -8

Add to next term:8 + (-8)=0

Multiply by1/2:0

Add to next term:16 +0=16

Multiply by1/2:8

Add to next term: -4 +8=4

Multiply by1/2:2

Add to last term: -2 +2=0

So

---------------

 the quotient is:

-16 p^4 -16 p^3 +0 p^2 +16 p +4

Thus

---------------

, Q(p)=(p -1/2)^2*(-16 p^4 -16 p^3 +16 p +4 )

Now

---------------

, factor the quartic: -16 p^4 -16 p^3 +16 p +4



---------------

Factor out -4: -4(4 p^4 +4 p^3 -4 p -1 )

Let me write

---------------

 as -4*(4 p^4 +4 p^3 -4 p -1 )

Try to factor quartic:



---------------

4 p^4 +4 p^3 -4 p -1

Try rational roots with p=1: 4+4-4-1=3≠0

p=-1:4 -4 +4 -1=3≠0

p

---------------

=1/2:4*(1/16)+4*(1/8) -4*(1/2) -1= 0.25 +0.5 -2 -1= -2.25≠0

Hmm

---------------

, maybe factor as quadratic in p²?

Alternatively, group terms:

4 p^4 +4 p^3 -4 p -1 =4 p^4 +4 p^3 -4 p -1

Group

---------------

 as (4 p^4 +4 p^3) + (-4 p -1)

=4 p^3(p +1) - (4 p +1)



---------------

Not helpful.

Alternatively, try to factor as (ap² + bp +c)(dp² + ep +f).

Ass

---------------

ume (4 p² + m p +n)(p² + qp +r)

Multiply out:

4 p^4 + (4 q + m) p^3 + (4 r + m q +n) p² + (m r +n q)p +n r

Compare to 4 p^4 +4 p^3 -4 p -1



---------------

Thus,

Coefficients:

4 p^4: OK

p^3: 4 q + m =4

p^2: 4 r + m q +n =0 (since there

---------------

 is no p² term)

p term: m r +n q =-4

constant term: n r =-1

We

---------------

 need to find integers m,n,q,r satisfying these.

From constant term n r =-1. Possible integer solutions: n=1, r=-1 or n=-1, r=1.

Try n=1, r=-1:

Then:



---------------

p term: m*(-1) +1*q = -m + q =-4 → q= m -4

From p^3:

---------------

 4 q + m =4. Substitute q=m-4:

4(m -4) +m =4 →4m -16 +m=5m -16=4 →5m=20 →m=4

Then q=4 -4=0

Now

---------------

 check p^2 term:

4*(-1) +4*0 +1= -4 +0 +1= -3 ≠0. Not good.

Try

---------------

 n=-1, r=1:

Then p term: m*1 + (-1)*q = m - q =-4 → q

---------------

 = m +4

p^3:4 q +m =4*(m+4)+m=4m+16 +m=5m +16=4 →5m= -12 → m

---------------

= -12/5. Not integer.

Not good.

Try other factors. Maybe fractions?

Alternatively, let me try

---------------

 another approach. Let me see:

Suppose the quartic factors as (2 p^2 + a p +b)(2 p^2 +c p +d )



---------------

Multiply out:

4 p^4 + (2c +2a)p^3 + (ac + 2d +2b)p^2 + (ad + bc)p +b

---------------

 d

Compare to 4 p^4 +4 p^3 -4 p -1

Thus,

4 p^4:

---------------

 OK

p^3: 2c +2a =4 → c +a=2

p^2: ac +2d +2b =0

p term: ad + bc =-4

constant term: b d =-1

Try

---------------

 possible integer solutions for b d=-1. Let me try b=1, d=-1:

Then:

p term: a*(-1) +c

---------------

*1 = -a +c =-4

From c +a=2 → c=2 -a

Sub

---------------

stitute into p term equation:

- a + (2 -a)= -2a +2 =-4 →-2a= -6 →a=3 →

---------------

c=2-3= -1

Check p^2 term:

a c +2d +2b = (3)(-1) +2*(-1)+2*(1)= -3 -2 +2= -3≠0.

---------------

 Not good.

Try b=-1, d=1:

Then p term: a*1 +c*(-1)=a -c =-4

From

---------------

 c +a=2 → c=2 -a

Substitute into p term equation:

a - (2 -a) =2a -2 =-4 →2a= -2 →a= -1, so

---------------

 c=2 -(-1)=3

Check p^2 term:

a c +2d +2b = (-1)(3) +2*

---------------

1 +2*(-1)= -3 +2 -2= -3≠0. Not good.

Hmm, not working. Maybe non

---------------

-integer factors?

Alternatively, perhaps this quartic is irreducible, so we need to solve numerically?

Alternatively, let

---------------

 me consider that since this is getting too involved, maybe the point C is at t=1/8 as previously found, but

---------------

 we saw that there is another intersection point. However, maybe that's the only other solution, but since it's on AB?



---------------

Wait, let's see. When we had t=1/8, the x-coordinate is 1/8, so the

---------------

 point C is (1/8, y). Compute y-coordinate on AB:

y = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)*( -1/8 +4/8 ) = (3 sqrt(3))/8.



---------------

So point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).

Now, let's check if this point is on the envelope.

---------------

 The envelope has parametric equations x= p^3, y=(1 - p²)^{3/2}

Sup

---------------

pose this point corresponds to some p.

So set x=1/8 = p^3 → p= (1/8)^{1/3}=1/2.

Wait

---------------

, p=1/2 gives x=(1/2)^3=1/8, so yes. But then y=(

---------------

1 - (1/2)^2)^{3/2}= (3/4)^{3/2}= (sqrt(3)/2)^3= (3 sqrt(3))/8, which matches. So the

---------------

 point C=(1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8) is indeed on the envelope and on AB. Since

---------------

 the envelope is tangent to AB here, this is the point of tangency. Therefore, this is the only point where the envelope meets AB (

---------------

other than at p=1/2 which is the point A). Wait, but at p=1/2, the envelope point

---------------

 is x=(1/2)^3=1/8, but no, wait, p=1/2 gives x=1/8 and

---------------

 y=3 sqrt(3)/8, which is point C. Wait, but when p=1/2, the line

---------------

 PQ(p) is AB itself, so the envelope's point at p=1/2 is point C. So the envelope touches

---------------

 AB exactly at point C, meaning that near C, the lines PQ(p) are tangent to AB, so C is the only point on AB that

---------------

 is on the envelope, hence not on any other PQ(p) except AB. Because for other points on AB, there are

---------------

 PQ(p) lines passing through them, but for C, the only PQ(p) that passes through it is the tangent line,

---------------

 which is AB itself. Therefore, this is the desired point C.

Therefore, the coordinates of C are (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).

---------------

 Therefore, the distance OC squared is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = (1 + 27)/64 =28/64 =7/16. Wait, but

---------------

 1/8 squared is 1/64, and (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 is 9*3 /64 =27/64. So

---------------

 total is (1 +27)/64=28/64=7/16. So 7/16,

---------------

 so p=7, q=16, which are coprime. Thus p+q=23.

Wait, but hold

---------------

 on. Wait, the problem states that C is on AB, distinct from A and B. Point C is (1/8, 3√3/8). Let me confirm coordinates

---------------

:

The parametrization of AB earlier was (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2). When

---------------

 t=1/8,

y= -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)*( -1/8 +4/8)= 3 sqrt(3)/8. Correct

---------------

.

Distance from O is sqrt( (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 ) squared

---------------

 is:

(1 + 27)/64 =28/64=7/16. So OC

---------------

²=7/16, so 7+16=23. So the answer should be 23.



---------------

But let me check again the previous thought where when t=1/8, there was another solution p≈0.0757.

---------------

 Wait, but if the envelope is tangent at C, then PQ(p) for p≈0.0757 would pass

---------------

 through C? But according to the envelope concept, the envelope is the set of points where each point is on exactly one PQ(p), and

---------------

 the envelope is tangent to PQ(p) at that point. Therefore, the point C is only on PQ(1/2),

---------------

 which is AB. The other solution p≈0.0757 comes from when we squared the equation, which might have introduced extraneous solutions.

---------------

 Let me verify with actual calculation.

Suppose p=0.0757, which is approximately 0.0757.

---------------

 Let me compute x and y for that p.

x= p^3≈ (0.0757)^3≈0.000433

---------------

, which is very small. The corresponding y on the envelope would be (1 - p²)^{3/2}≈ (

---------------

1 -0.0057)^{1.5}≈ approx 1. So that point is near (0,1), which is point B. So

---------------

 perhaps that solution corresponds to point B, but since B is excluded, the only other intersection is at B, but B is already

---------------

 part of AB. So perhaps the only non-trivial intersection is at C. Therefore, the calculation is correct, and OC²=7/16, so 

---------------

23.

But I want to confirm once more.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the envelope approach. Let me think

---------------

 differently.

Since we found through the double root condition that t=1/8 gives the desired point, even though the quartic had another root, but

---------------

 in reality, that other root corresponds to p=1/2 or to a point outside the segment AB?

Wait, when

---------------

 we found t=1/8, the point C is on AB, and the other solution p≈0.0757 gives

---------------

 a point on the envelope which is also on AB, but that point is actually C itself? Because when p=1/2, the

---------------

 envelope point is C, and the other solution p≈0.0757 would have to correspond to another point on

---------------

 AB?

Wait, but according to the parametric equations of the envelope, when p=1/2, we get point

---------------

 C. For other p's, the envelope is elsewhere. The equation we solved was for the intersection of the envelope with AB, so

---------------

 the only solutions are p=1/2 (which is point C) and possibly another point? But according to the calculation

---------------

 above, when solving the equation for the envelope and AB, we had p=1/2 as a double root and another root

---------------

 p≈0.0757, but that p gives a point very close to the y-axis, but still on AB?



---------------

Wait, let me compute the coordinates for p=0.0757 (approximate value):

Let me compute p

---------------

= [ -3 + sqrt(13) ] /8 ≈ [ -3 +3.6055 ] /8 ≈0.6055/8≈0.0757.

So

---------------

 x= p^3≈0.0757³≈0.000433, y=(

---------------

1 -p²)^{3/2}≈(1 -0.0057)^{1.5}≈(

---------------

0.9943)^{1.5}≈0.9943*sqrt(0.9943)≈0

---------------

.9943*0.997≈0.991. So the point would be (0.0004, 0.991), which is very close to (0,1), which is point B. But

---------------

 B is excluded, so the only valid intersection point on AB (excluding B and A) is C at (1/8, 3√3/8).

Therefore, the

---------------

 earlier calculation stands. Thus, OC squared is 7/16, so p+q=7+16=23.

Wait

---------------

, but let me check once more with coordinates:

OC² = (1/8)^2 + (3√3 /8)^2 = 1/64 + 27/64 =28/64=7/16. Yes

---------------

, correct.

Therefore, the answer is 23.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{23}


Given points \( O(0,0) \), \( A\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right) \), and \( B\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) \), we need to find a unique point \( C \) on segment \( \overline{AB} \) that does not belong to any segment from the family \( \mathcal{F} \) except \( \overline{AB} \). The family \( \mathcal{F} \) consists of segments \( \overline{PQ} \) of unit length with \( P \) on the \( x \)-axis and \( Q \) on the \( y \)-axis.

1. **Equation of Segment

---------------

 \( \overline{AB} \)**:
   - The line \( \overline{AB} \) has a slope of \( -\sqrt{3} \).


---------------

   - Equation: \( y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \).

2. **Param

---------------

etrization of \( \overline{AB} \)**:
   - Any point \( C \) on \( \overline{AB} \) can be written as \( \left(t, -\sqrt{3}t + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) \) where \( 0 \leq t \leq \frac{1}{2} \).

3. **Equ

---------------

ation of Segments in \( \mathcal{F} \)**:
   - For a segment \( \overline{PQ} \) with \( P(p, 0) \) and \( Q(0, \sqrt{1 - p^2}) \), the line equation is \( y = -\frac{\sqrt{1 - p^2}}{p}x + \sqrt{1 - p^2} \).

4. **Condition for Point \( C \)**:
   - The point \( C \) must satisfy

---------------

 the line equation of \( \overline{AB} \) and not lie on any other segment in \( \mathcal{F} \).


---------------

   - This leads to solving the equation derived from the intersection of \( \overline{AB} \) and the envelope of the family \( \mathcal{F} \).

5. **Envelope of the Family \( \mathcal{F} \)**:
   - The envelope's

---------------

 parametric equations are \( x = p^3 \) and \( y = (1 - p^2)^{3/2} \).
   - Sol

---------------

ving the intersection with \( \overline{AB} \), we find the point \( C \) where the envelope is tangent to \( \overline{AB} \).

6. **S

---------------

olving for \( t \)**:
   - The point \( C \) is found at \( t = \frac{1}{8} \), leading to coordinates \( \left(\frac{1}{8}, \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right) \).

7. **Calculating \( OC^2 \)**:
   - \( OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{64} + \frac{27}{64} = \frac{28}{64} = \frac{7}{16} \).

Thus, \( OC^2 = \frac{7}{16} \), and

---------------

 \( p + q = 7 + 16 = 23 \).
