Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of ways to place digits in a 2x3 grid such that two conditions are met. First, the sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by reading each row left to right should be 999. Second, the sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by reading each column top to bottom should be 99. The

---------------

 example given is a grid where the top row is 0,0,8 and the bottom row is 9,9,1. Let

---------------

 me see how that works: 008 + 991 = 999, and then the columns are 0+9=9, 0+9=9, and 8+1=9, so

---------------

 each column sums to 9, and adding those three gives 9+9+9=27, but wait, the problem says the sum of

---------------

 the three numbers formed vertically is 99. Wait, hold on, maybe I misread that part.

Wait, the

---------------

 problem says "the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99". Hmm, so maybe each column is considered

---------------

 as a 2-digit number, top then bottom, and their sum is 99? Let me check the example given

---------------

. The grid is:

First row: 0,0,8

Second row:9,9,1

So the

---------------

 columns would be:

First column: 0 and 9, forming 09? Or 90? Wait, the

---------------

 problem says "reading top to bottom", so the first column is top digit first, so it's 0 followed by 9, which

---------------

 would be 09, but leading zeros are allowed here? Or is it a two-digit number where the top digit is the tens place and the bottom is the ones? Wait

---------------

, the example says the sum of the three numbers formed top to bottom is 99. Let's compute that:

First

---------------

 column: 0 and 9. If it's a two-digit number, top digit is tens place, so 0*

---------------

10 + 9 = 9. Second column: 0 and 9: same, 09, which is 9. Third column: 8 and 1,

---------------

 so 8*10 +1 =81. So adding those three numbers: 9 +9 +81 = 99. Oh

---------------

, that's right. So each column is a two-digit number where the top digit is the tens place and the bottom is the ones.

---------------

 So the first column is 09, which is 9, second column is 09 again, 9, third is 81. So

---------------

 their sum is indeed 99. Got it.

So the problem is to arrange digits in a 2x3 grid such

---------------

 that:

1. The top row (three digits) forms a number A, the bottom row forms a number B, and A + B = 999.

2. Each column,

---------------

 read as a two-digit number (top digit is tens, bottom is ones), so for column 1: 10*a11 + a21, column 2: 10*a12 +a22, column3:10*a13 +a23. The sum of these three numbers

---------------

 is 99.

We need to count the number of such grids.

Let me denote the grid as follows:

Let the top row be digits a, b, c (

---------------

so the top number is 100a + 10b + c)

The bottom row is digits d, e, f (so the bottom number is 100d + 10e + f)

So

---------------

 the first condition is (100a +10b + c) + (100d +10e + f) = 999.

The second condition is:



---------------

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

We

---------------

 need to find the number of 6-tuples (a,b,c,d,e,f) where each is a digit from 0 to 9, with

---------------

 a and d not both zero? Wait, actually, since they are the first digits of 3-digit numbers, so a and d can

---------------

 be zero? Wait, the problem says "numbers formed by reading left to right". So, the top number is a 3-digit number, so

---------------

 leading zeros are allowed? Wait in the example, the top row starts with 0, so 008 is considered a

---------------

 3-digit number, which is 8. So perhaps leading zeros are allowed here. So a, b, c can be 0-9, and

---------------

 similarly d, e, f can be 0-9. So the first number can be from 000 to 999, but

---------------

 when you add the two numbers, they have to sum to 999. Similarly for the vertical columns.

So let

---------------

's first write down the equations.

First equation:

(100a +10b + c) + (100d +10e + f) = 999.



---------------

Second equation:

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

Let

---------------

 me see if we can manipulate these equations to find relationships between the variables.

Let me first handle the first equation. Let's expand

---------------

 it:

100a +10b + c + 100d +10e + f = 999

Group

---------------

 like terms:

100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

Similarly

---------------

, the second equation is:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

Which

---------------

 can be written as:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Hmm, so

---------------

 perhaps there's a way to relate these two equations.

Let me denote S1 = a + d, S2 = b + e, S3 = c + f.



---------------

Then the first equation becomes 100 S1 + 10 S2 + S3 = 999.

Similarly, the

---------------

 second equation can be written as 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Let

---------------

 me note that (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = S1 + S2 + S3.

Therefore

---------------

, the second equation is 10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.



---------------

Let me denote T = a + b + c, so then d + e + f = 99 - 10*T.

But

---------------

 also, S1 + S2 + S3 = (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = T + (99 - 10*T) = 99 -9*T.

Hmm

---------------

, but maybe that's not the most helpful. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find relationships between the variables by

---------------

 looking at the first equation's digits.

Looking at the first equation: 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

This

---------------

 equation must hold as a number. So, let me consider the digits of 999. The units digit is 9, the tens digit is 9, and the hundreds digit is 9. So

---------------

, the sum (a + d)*100 + (b + e)*10 + (c + f) must equal 999. Therefore

---------------

, the individual digits when adding the two numbers must add up such that:

The units digit (c + f) mod 10 must

---------------

 equal 9, and the carryover from the units to the tens place is floor[(c + f)/10].

Similarly, the tens digit (

---------------

b + e + carryover from units) mod 10 must equal 9, and carryover to hundreds is floor[(b + e + carryover_units)/10].

The

---------------

 hundreds digit (a + d + carryover from tens) must equal 9 (since 999 has a hundreds digit of 9),

---------------

 and there's no higher digit, so the total must not have a thousands digit, so the carryover from hundreds must be zero.

Therefore

---------------

, let me formalize this:

Let me denote the variables:

Let’s define variables for the carries:

Let c0 = carry

---------------

over from units to tens: c0 = floor[(c + f)/10]

Then the units digit is (c + f) - 10*c0 = 9.

---------------

 So,

(c + f) = 9 + 10*c0. (Equation 1)

Similarly, moving

---------------

 to the tens place:

The total in the tens place before carryover is (b + e) + c0.

The

---------------

 digit here must be 9, so:

(b + e + c0) mod 10 = 9,

and the carryover to the hundreds place is

---------------

 c1 = floor[(b + e + c0)/10].

Thus,

(b + e + c0) = 9 + 10*c1. (Equation 2)

Then

---------------

, moving to the hundreds place:

The total here before carryover is (a + d) + c1.

This must equal 9, because

---------------

 the hundreds digit of 999 is 9, and there is no carryover beyond that (since 999 is a

---------------

 3-digit number). Therefore,

(a + d) + c1 = 9. (Equation 3)

Additionally

---------------

, since there is no carryover beyond the hundreds place, c1 must be 0 or 1, but since (a + d) + c1 =9, and

---------------

 a and d are digits (0-9), their sum can be at most 18, so c1 could be up to floor[(b

---------------

 + e + c0)/10]. Hmm, but let's see.

So, we have three equations here (Equ

---------------

ations 1, 2, 3) involving c0, c1, and the variables a,b,c,d,e,f.

Additionally

---------------

, the second condition is the sum of the vertical columns:

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

Let me compute

---------------

 this sum:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

So

---------------

 that's another equation. Let me note that.

So, we have multiple equations here. Let me see if we can combine

---------------

 them.

First, let me note that from Equation 3: a + d = 9 - c1.

Similarly, from Equation 2: b + e = 9 + 10*c1 - c0.

Wait, Equation

---------------

 2 says (b + e + c0) = 9 + 10*c1, so rearranged,

---------------

 b + e = 9 +10*c1 - c0.

From Equation 1: c + f = 9 +10*c0.

So

---------------

, we can express a + d, b + e, and c + f in terms of c0 and c1.

Let

---------------

 me also note that the total sum of all digits in rows:

The first number is 100a +10b +c, the

---------------

 second is 100d +10e +f, so their sum is 999. Alternatively, the

---------------

 sum of all digits (a + b + c + d + e + f) can be related to the digits of 999,

---------------

 but since there are carries involved, it's not straightforward. However, maybe we can use the vertical sum equation.

The vertical sum equation

---------------

: 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) =99.

Let me denote:



---------------

Let me call S = a + b + c,

then d + e + f = 99 - 10*S.

Therefore

---------------

, the total sum of all digits is S + (99 -10*S) = 99 -9*S.

Hmm

---------------

, but also, from the first equation, the sum of the two numbers is 999. Let me see if

---------------

 that can be connected.

The sum of the two numbers is (100a +10b +c) + (100d +10e +f) = 999.



---------------

This is equal to 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999,

---------------

 which we already considered.

Alternatively, the total digit sum (without considering carries) would be (a + d) + (b + e)*1 +

---------------

 (c + f)*1, but with carries. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps using the variables

---------------

 from Equations 1, 2, 3.

Let me see:

We have:

Equation 1: c + f = 9 +10c

---------------

0.

Equation 2: b + e = 9 +10c1 - c0.

Equation 3: a + d = 9 - c1.

Additionally

---------------

, from the vertical sum equation:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Let me express

---------------

 d + e + f in terms of S:

d + e + f = 99 - 10*(a + b + c).

But

---------------

 also, note that d + e + f = (d) + (e) + (f).

Alternatively, let me try

---------------

 to express everything in terms of a, b, c, d, e, f, but perhaps substituting variables.

Alternatively, let

---------------

 me consider the variables c0 and c1 as parameters. Since c0 and c1 are carryover digits, they must

---------------

 be integers. Let me see the possible values for c0 and c1.

First, c0 is the carryover from the units to tens place

---------------

, so c0 can be 0 or 1, because c + f can be at most 9 + 9 =18, so c

---------------

0 is floor((c + f)/10). Since c + f can be from 9 (if c0=0)

---------------

 up to 19? Wait, but c and f are digits (0-9). So maximum c + f is 18, so c0 can be 0 or 1.

Similarly, c1 is the carryover from the tens to hundreds place. The tens

---------------

 place calculation is (b + e + c0). The maximum possible value here is (9 +9 +1)=19, so c1 can be 0 or 1.



---------------

Wait, but let me confirm:

In the tens place: (b + e + c0). Since b and e are digits (0-9), c

---------------

0 is 0 or 1. So the maximum possible is 9 +9 +1 =19, so floor

---------------

(19/10)=1. So c1 can be 0 or 1.

Similarly, the hundreds place:

---------------

 (a + d) + c1 must equal 9. Since a and d are digits (0-9), their sum can be from

---------------

 0 to 18. Adding c1 (0 or 1), so total can be from 0+0=0 to 18+1=19. But the

---------------

 equation says (a + d) + c1 =9, so possible?

Wait, but (a + d) +

---------------

 c1 =9, so since a + d can be up to 9 + c1? Wait, but c1 is 

---------------

0 or 1. Let's see.

Let me consider possible c0 and c1 values.

Case 1: c0 =0,

---------------

 c1 =0.

Then:

From Equation 3: a + d =9.

From Equation 2: b + e =9 +1

---------------

0*0 -0 =9.

From Equation 1: c + f =9 +0=9.

Then the

---------------

 vertical sum equation:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) =99.

Let

---------------

 me compute d + e + f: since d =9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c.



---------------

Wait, since a + d =9 => d =9 -a,

Similarly, e =9 - b,

f =9 -c.

Therefore

---------------

, d + e + f = (9 -a) + (9 -b) + (9 -c) =27 - (a +b +c).

Therefore

---------------

, substituting into vertical sum equation:

10*(a + b + c) + (27 - (a + b + c)) =99.



---------------

Simplify:

10S +27 - S =99, where S =a +b +c.

So

---------------

 9S +27=99 => 9S =72 => S=8.

Therefore, a + b +c=8.



---------------

But also, since d =9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c,

the digits d

---------------

, e, f are determined by a, b, c.

But we also need to ensure that all digits are between 0 and 9.

So

---------------

 for each digit a, b, c, we have d=9 -a must be between 0 and 9,

---------------

 so a can be from 0 to9, but 9 -a must also be between 0 and9. Since

---------------

 a is a digit (0-9), d is automatically between 0 and9. Similarly for e and f.

So

---------------

 the constraints here are:

a, b, c are digits (0-9),

a + b + c =8,

and d

---------------

=9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c must also be digits (0-9),

---------------

 which they are as long as a, b, c are between 0 and9.

Therefore, in this case (c0=0, c1=0), the number of solutions is equal to the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =8, where each of a, b, c is between 0 and9.



---------------

But since 8 is less than 3*9, the only constraints are that each variable is at least 0 and at most 9, but since the

---------------

 sum is 8, each variable can be at most 8, so the standard stars and bars applies.

The number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =8 is C(8 +3 -1, 3 -1)= C(10,2)=45.

However

---------------

, we need to ensure that each of a, b, c is a digit (so up to 9, which is already

---------------

 satisfied here since 8 is the total sum). So 45 solutions here.

But wait, but in this case, the

---------------

 vertical numbers would be:

First column: 10a + d =10a + (9 -a) =9a +9 =

---------------

9(a +1).

Similarly, second column:10b + e=10b + (9 -b)=9b +9=9(b+1).

Third column:10c +f=10c + (9 -c)=9c +9=9(c +1).

Therefore

---------------

, each column is a multiple of 9, and their sum is 9(a+1 + b+1 +c+1)=9(a + b +c +3)=9*(8 +3)=9*11=99, which matches the required

---------------

 vertical sum. So that's consistent.

Therefore, in this case, all solutions are valid as long as a + b + c =8,

---------------

 and digits a, b, c are 0-9. So 45 solutions.

Case 2: c0=0, c1=1.

Wait

---------------

, let's check if this is possible.

If c0=0, then c + f =9 +10*0=9.



---------------

Then Equation 2: b + e =9 +10*c1 -c0=9 +10*1 -0=19.

But b and e are digits (each 0-9), so their sum can be at most 18. So

---------------

 19 is impossible. Therefore, c1 cannot be 1 when c0=0. So this case is invalid.

Case 3: c0=1, c1=0.

Then

---------------

:

From Equation 1: c + f =9 +10*1=19.

But c and f are digits (0-9 each), so their

---------------

 maximum sum is 18. 19 is impossible. So this case is invalid.

Case 4: c0=1, c1=1.

Now

---------------

 let's see:

Equation 1: c + f =9 +10*1=19. Still impossible,

---------------

 since c and f can only add up to 18 maximum. So this case is also invalid.

Wait, so only

---------------

 the first case (c0=0, c1=0) is possible? Wait, that can't be. Because

---------------

 in the example given, the vertical columns are 09,09,81. Let me check what the c

---------------

0 and c1 would be in that example.

In the example:

Top row:0,0,8; bottom row:9,9,1.

So c

---------------

 is 8, f is1. c + f=9. So c0= floor(9/10)=0.

Then

---------------

, moving to the tens place:

b + e =0 +9=9. Adding c0=0: 9 +

---------------

0=9, so the tens digit is 9, so c1= floor(9/10)=0. So

---------------

 c1=0.

Therefore, this is indeed the first case.

So the only possible case is c0=0 and c1=0.

---------------

 Therefore, all solutions must satisfy a +d =9, b +e=9, c +f=9, and a +b +c=8,

---------------

 so d +e +f=27 - (a +b +c)=27-8=19,

---------------

 but then 10*(a+b+c) + (d + e + f)=10*8 +19=80+19=99, which works

---------------

.

Therefore, the only possible case is c0=0 and c1=0, leading to a +d =9, b +e=9, c +f=9, and a +b +c=8.

Therefore

---------------

, the total number of solutions is the number of triples (a,b,c) where a, b, c are digits (0-9) with a + b + c =8, and then d=

---------------

9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c are also digits (which they will be since a,

---------------

 b, c are between 0 and9, so 9 -a etc. are between 0 and9).

Therefore

---------------

, the number of triples (a,b,c) is the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =8,

---------------

 with each variable between 0 and8 (since their sum is 8, so each variable can't exceed 8). The

---------------

 number is C(8 +3 -1, 3-1)=C(10,2)=45.

---------------

 So that's 45 solutions.

Wait, but hold on. Wait, in the problem statement, the example given has a=0, b=0, c=8, which is

---------------

 one such solution. But is there any restriction on leading zeros? The problem says "the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999". The

---------------

 numbers can have leading zeros, as the example includes 008. So a and d can be zero. So all

---------------

 45 solutions are valid?

Wait, but let me think again. Each of a, b, c, d, e, f must

---------------

 be digits (0-9), but there's no restriction on being non-zero except that they are digits. So yes, leading

---------------

 zeros are allowed, so all 45 are valid.

Wait, but hold on a second. Wait, in the vertical

---------------

 columns, each column's two-digit number is 10a +d, etc. So for the first column, if

---------------

 a is 0 and d is 9, that gives 09, which is 9. That's acceptable.

---------------

 So all the vertical numbers can be from 00 to99, but their sum has to be 99. So

---------------

 all the constraints are satisfied as per the equations.

Therefore, the total number of grids is 45?

But hold on, wait

---------------

, let me check if there are other cases where c0 or c1 can be non-zero but still possible.

Earlier I

---------------

 considered c0 can be 0 or 1, but when c0=1, c + f must be 19, which is impossible. So

---------------

 only c0=0 is possible. Similarly, c1 can be 0 or 1, but when c0=0, c

---------------

1 can only be 0 because otherwise, b + e would have to be 19, which is impossible. So

---------------

 indeed, only one case is possible, leading to 45 solutions. So is the answer 45? But wait

---------------

, let me think again.

Wait, in the example given, the digits are a=0, b=0, c=8;

---------------

 d=9, e=9, f=1. So that's one of the 45 solutions. But let

---------------

 me see if there's another constraint that I missed.

Wait, the problem states "the number of ways to place a digit in each cell". Each cell is

---------------

 a digit, so each of a,b,c,d,e,f can be 0-9, but with the constraints from the equations.

Wait

---------------

, but in the equations above, we considered that a + b + c =8. So each triplet (a,b,c) must

---------------

 sum to 8, and then d,e,f are determined as 9 - a, etc. However, in this scenario

---------------

, each of d,e,f is uniquely determined by a,b,c. So each solution (a,b,c) gives exactly one grid. Therefore

---------------

, the total number is indeed the number of triples (a,b,c) with a + b + c =8, with

---------------

 a,b,c digits (0-9). Since their sum is 8, each variable can be at most 8, so all

---------------

 variables are within 0-8, hence valid digits.

Therefore, the number is C(10,2)=45. So

---------------

 is that the answer?

Wait, but let me think again. Wait, when we count the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =8, it

---------------

's indeed 45. But each of these corresponds to a unique grid. However, are there any additional constraints?

Wait, for

---------------

 example, in the vertical columns, the two-digit numbers are 10a + d, etc. Since d=9 -a, so

---------------

 10a + (9 -a)=9a +9. Similarly for others. So each column is 9*(a+1), 9*(b+1), 9*(c+1). Therefore

---------------

, each column is a multiple of 9, and their sum is 9*(a+1 + b+1 + c+1)=9*(a +b +c +3)=9*(8 +3)=99, which is

---------------

 correct.

Therefore, all these grids satisfy the vertical sum condition. Therefore, yes, 45 is the answer.

Wait, but let

---------------

 me think again. Wait, the problem says "the number of ways to place a digit in each cell". Since digits can be repeated

---------------

, except that they are determined by a,b,c. For example, a can be 0-8, but even if

---------------

 a is 0, d is 9, etc. So each triplet (a,b,c) gives exactly one grid.

---------------

 So 45 should be correct.

Wait, but hold on. Let me check with another example. Suppose a=8, b=0, c=0. Then d=1, e=9, f=9. So

---------------

 the grid would be:

Top row:8,0,0

Bottom row:1,9,9

Then the top

---------------

 number is 800, bottom is 199. Their sum is 800 + 199 = 999, which is correct. The vertical columns:



---------------

First column: 10*8 +1=81, second:10*0 +9=9, third:10*0 +9=9. Sum

---------------

:81 +9 +9=99. That works. So this is another valid grid. So that's counted

---------------

 in the 45.

Another example: a=2, b=3, c=3. Then a + b +c=8. Then d=7, e=6, f=6. The

---------------

 grid:

Top:2,3,3

Bottom:7,6,6

Top number:233, bottom:766. Sum:

---------------

233+766=999. Columns: 27, 36, 36. Sum

---------------

:27+36+36=99. Correct.

So all these work. So seems okay. Therefore

---------------

, the answer is 45? Hmm.

Wait, but hold on. Let me check the problem statement again. It

---------------

 says "the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99". The example given has three numbers: 09,09,81 which

---------------

 add to 99. Each of these is a two-digit number, so the first column is 0 followed by9, so

---------------

 09, which is 9. But in the problem statement, when it says "numbers", does it allow leading zeros? For

---------------

 instance, is 09 considered a valid two-digit number? The problem didn't specify that numbers can't have leading zeros, so

---------------

 yes, as the example includes it. Therefore, all the cases where a=0 are allowed. So the count is indeed

---------------

 45.

But wait, let me check another thing. Suppose a=5, b=2, c=1, which

---------------

 sums to 8. Then d=4, e=7, f=8. Then the vertical numbers would be 10*5 +4=54, 10*2 +7=27, 10*1 +8=18. Their

---------------

 sum is 54+27+18=99. Correct. So that works.

Alternatively, if a=0, b=0, c=8,

---------------

 then vertical columns are 09,09,81. Which is exactly the example. So all these are valid.

Therefore

---------------

, the total number is 45. Hmm. But I feel like maybe I'm missing something here. Because 45 seems straightforward

---------------

, but perhaps I need to check if there are other cases where c0 or c1 can be different?

Wait, let

---------------

 me think again about the equations. Earlier, I considered that c0 can only be 0 because c + f=9 or

---------------

 19, but 19 is impossible, so c0 must be 0. Then c1 can only be 0 because

---------------

 otherwise, the sum b +e would be too big. Therefore, only one case. So 45 is correct. Hmm

---------------

.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations. Let me rederive them.

The first equation: the two numbers

---------------

 add to 999. Let me think of the addition:

   ABC
+  DEF
-------
  999

Where ABC is the top number,

---------------

 DEF the bottom. So when adding digit by digit:

Starting from the units digit:

C + F = 9 or 19 (since if

---------------

 there's a carryover, but since the total is 9 in the units place, so C + F =9 or 19 (

---------------

with a carryover of 1). But since the next digit (tens) must also sum to 9, let

---------------

's see:

Tens digit: B + E + carryover_from_units =9 or 19. But the total digit

---------------

 is 9, so:

(B + E + carryover) mod10 =9,

and carryover to hundreds is floor[(

---------------

B + E + carryover)/10].

Hundreds digit: A + D + carryover_from_tens =9.



---------------

And there must be no carryover beyond the hundreds digit, so the total carryover_from_tens must be such that A + D + carryover_from_tens =9,

---------------

 and there is no thousands digit.

Therefore, if there is a carryover_from_units (i.e., C + F >=

---------------

10, so C + F =19, carryover=1), then in the tens digit:

B + E +1 must end

---------------

 with 9, so B + E +1 =9 or 19 (if there's another carryover). Then

---------------

 carryover_from_tens would be 0 or1.

Then in hundreds place:

A + D + carryover_from_tens =9.

Similarly

---------------

, if there was a carryover_from_units of 1, then in the tens place:

If B + E +1 =9,

---------------

 then carryover_from_tens is 0,

or if B + E +1 =19, then carryover_from_tens is1,

---------------

 leading to A + D +1 =9 => A + D=8.

Wait, so maybe there are more cases here

---------------

 where carryover_from_units is 1?

Wait, my previous analysis assumed c0 and c1 can only be 0,

---------------

 but maybe I was wrong. Let me re-examine.

Let me denote:

Let me define:

Let c0 = carryover from units to tens:

---------------

 floor( (C + F)/10 )

Similarly, c1 = carryover from tens to hundreds: floor( (B + E + c0)/10 )

Then

---------------

 the hundreds digit equation is A + D + c1 =9.

The units digit equation:

(C + F) =9 +10*c0.



---------------

The tens digit equation:

(B + E + c0) =9 +10*c1.

The hundreds digit equation:

(A + D) + c1 =9.

Additionally

---------------

, the vertical sum equation:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f)=99.

Now

---------------

, let's see possible values for c0 and c1.

Possible c0 can be 0 or 1, since C and F are digits (0

---------------

-9), so their sum can be up to 18, so c0 can be 0,1.

c

---------------

1 can be 0 or1, because (B + E + c0) can be up to (9 +9 +1)=19, so floor(19/10)=1.

So

---------------

 possible cases are:

Case 1: c0=0, c1=0.

Case 2: c0=0, c1=1.

Case 3: c0=1, c1=0.

Case4: c0=1, c1=1.

Now

---------------

 let's check each case.

Case1: c0=0, c1=0.

Then:

C + F =9.



---------------

B + E =9.

A + D=9.

Then vertical sum equation:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f)=99.

But

---------------

 since d=9 -a,

e=9 -b,

f=9 -c,

so d + e + f =27 - (a + b + c).

Therefore

---------------

,

10S + (27 - S)=99,

so 9S=72 => S=8,



---------------

so a + b +c=8,

as before. So this is the previous case, with 45 solutions.

Case2: c0=0, c1=1.

Then

---------------

:

C + F=9 (since c0=0).

B + E +0 =9 +10*1=

---------------

19,

so B + E=19.

But B and E are digits (0-9), so their maximum sum is 18. So

---------------

 this is impossible. So Case2 invalid.

Case3: c0=1, c1=0.

Then:

C + F=9 +10*1=19.



---------------

So C and F must add to 19. Since they are digits, the only way is C=9 and F=10? No, digits

---------------

 are 0-9. So 9 +10? Not possible. The maximum C + F is 9+9=18. So

---------------

 this is impossible. Therefore, Case3 invalid.

Case4: c0=1, c1=1.

Then:

C + F=19 (

---------------

impossible, as above),

so this is invalid.

Therefore, only Case1 is valid, leading to 45 solutions.

Therefore

---------------

, the answer is 45. Hmm, so I think that's correct. But let me see if there's another

---------------

 angle.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different way to approach the problem that might reveal something else.

Let me consider the vertical sum equation

---------------

 again:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) =99.

But we also have from the horizontal sum:

100(a + d) +10(b + e) + (c + f)=999.

Let me denote

---------------

 variables:

Let me let S1 = a + d,

S2 = b + e,

S3 = c + f.

Then the

---------------

 horizontal equation is 100S1 +10S2 + S3 =999,

and the vertical equation is 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f)=99.

Note

---------------

 that a + b + c + d + e + f = (a +d) + (b +e) + (c +f) = S1 + S2 + S3.

Let

---------------

 me denote T = a + b + c,

then the vertical equation becomes 10T + ( (S1 + S2 + S3) - T ) =99,

since d + e + f = (S1 + S2 + S3) - T.

Therefore

---------------

:

10T + (S1 + S2 + S3 - T) =99,

so 9T + S1 + S2 + S3 =99.

But

---------------

 from the horizontal equation:

100S1 +10S2 + S3 =999.

So now

---------------

 we have two equations:

1) 100S1 +10S2 + S3 =999,

2) 9T + S1 + S2 + S3 =99.

But

---------------

 since T = a + b +c,

and S1 =a +d,

S2 =b +e,

S3 =c +f,

then

---------------

 S1 + S2 + S3 = (a +d) + (b +e) + (c +f)= (a +b +c) + (d +e +f)= T + (d +e +f).



---------------

But d +e +f = (S1 + S2 + S3) - T, which loops back. Maybe

---------------

 not helpful.

Alternatively, let me try to subtract equations or find a relation between them.

Let me subtract equation2 from equation1:

(100S1 +10S2 + S3) - (9T + S1 + S2 + S3) = 999 -99=

---------------

900.

This gives:

99S1 +9S2 -9T =900,

Divide both sides by9:

11S1 + S2 - T =100.

But

---------------

 T = a + b +c,

and S1 =a +d,

S2 =b +e,

Therefore,

---------------

 substituting T:

11S1 + S2 - (a + b + c)=100.

But S

---------------

1 = a +d => a = S1 -d,

But not sure if helpful. Alternatively, express T in terms of S1, S2, S

---------------

3.

Wait, T = a +b +c,

and S1 + S2 + S3 = (a +d)+(b +e)+(c +f)

---------------

 = (a +b +c) + (d +e +f) = T + (d +e +f).



---------------

Hmm, perhaps this isn't helpful.

Alternatively, let me consider that from the horizontal equation:

100S1 +10S2 +S3 =999,

so

---------------

 S3 =999 -100S1 -10S2.

Plugging into equation2:

9T + S1 + S2 + (999 -100S1 -10S2)=99,

so

---------------

 9T + S1 + S2 +999 -100S1 -10S2=99,

s

---------------

implify:

9T -99S1 -9S2 +999 =99,

then,

9T -99S1 -9S2 = -900,

divide both sides by9:

T -11S1 -S2 = -100,

so T =11S1 + S2 -100.

But T = a + b +c,

and since

---------------

 a, b, c are digits (0-9 each), the maximum T can be is 27 (if all are 9),

---------------

 but in our case, since S1 =a +d, and d is a digit (0-9), so S1 can be at

---------------

 most 18 (if a=9 and d=9). Similarly, S2 can be up to 18.

Wait

---------------

, but let's see. Since S1 =a +d,

and from horizontal equation:

100S1 +10S2 +S3=999,

so

---------------

 each term must be such that 100S1 ≤999 => S1 ≤9.99, so S1 ≤

---------------

9.

Similarly, 10S2 must be ≤999, but with S1 contributing, but actually,

---------------

 since S1 is at most 9, then 100*9=900, so remaining 10S2 + S3 must

---------------

 be 99, so S2 can be up to 9 (if S3 is 9).

Wait, so

---------------

 S1 must be at most9.

Because if S1 were 10, then 100*10=1000 which

---------------

 already exceeds 999.

Therefore, S1 can be from 0 to9.

Similarly, S2 must be such that 10S

---------------

2 ≤ 999 -100S1 - S3,

but since S3 is at least 0,

---------------

 so 10S2 ≤ 999 -100S1,

so S2 ≤ (999 -100S1)/10,

but

---------------

 since S1 is up to9,

for S1=9: 999 -900=99,

---------------

 so S2 ≤9.9, so S2 ≤9,

for S1=8: 999-800=199,

---------------

 so S2 ≤19.9, but S2 is b + e, so maximum 18,

but since

---------------

 S2 must be an integer.

But in any case, S1 is between0 and9.

Therefore, let me see

---------------

:

Given that S1 can be from0 to9, and S2 can be from0 to (9 +9)=18,



---------------

but with constraints from the equations.

But perhaps this approach is more complex. Since we already have the previous analysis leading to 45,

---------------

 and cross-verified with examples, perhaps that is correct.

Therefore, I think the answer is 45. So I

---------------

'll go with that.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{45}


To solve the problem, we need to find the number of ways to place digits in a 2x3 grid such that the sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows is 999, and the sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns is 99.

###

---------------

 Key Steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let the top row be digits \(a, b, c\) forming the number \(100a + 10b + c\).
   - Let the bottom row be digits \(d, e, f\) forming the number \(100d + 10e + f\).

2. **Equations from the Problem:**
   - The sum of the two 3-digit numbers:

---------------

 
     \[
     (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
     \]
     This simplifies to:
     \[
     100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999
     \]
   - The sum of the three 2-digit numbers from the columns:
     \[
     (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99
     \]
     This simplifies to:
     \[
     10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99
     \]

3. **Analy

---------------

zing the Equations:**
   - From the first equation, we consider the digits and their carries:
     - Units place: \(c + f = 9 + 10c_0\) where \(c_0\) is the carryover to

---------------

 the tens place.
     - Tens place: \(b + e + c_0 = 9 + 10c_1\) where \(c_1\) is the carryover to the hundreds place.
     - Hundreds place: \(a + d + c_1 = 9\).
   - Possible

---------------

 values for \(c_0\) and \(c_1\) are 0 or 1. Only valid combinations are found

---------------

 to be \(c_0 = 0\) and \(c_1 = 0\).

4. **Solving with

---------------

 Valid Carryovers:**
   - With \(c_0 = 0\) and \(c_1 = 0\):
     - \(a + d = 9\)
     - \(b + e = 9\)
     - \(c + f = 9\)
   - The vertical sum equation becomes:
     \[
     10(a + b + c) + (27 - (a + b + c)) = 99
     \]
     Solving this gives \(a + b + c = 8\).

5. **Counting Solutions:**
   - The number of non-negative integer solutions to \(a + b + c = 8\) is

---------------

 given by the stars and bars method:
     \[
     \binom{8 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{10}{2} = 45
     \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{45}
