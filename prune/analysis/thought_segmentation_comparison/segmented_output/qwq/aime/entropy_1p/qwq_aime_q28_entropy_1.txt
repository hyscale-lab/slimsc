Okay, let's see. I have this problem with two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G are on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE. Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this first.

First, since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So AB = CD = 107, and BC = AD = 16. Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle, so EF = GH = 184, and FG = EH = 17. Wait, FG is 17, so EH should also be 17? Let me confirm: in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So yes, FG and EH are opposite sides, so FG = EH = 17, and EF and GH are 184. Got that.

Now, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. Let me try to sketch this mentally. Let me imagine rectangle ABCD: let's say it's positioned so that side AB is the top, BC is the right side, CD is the bottom, and DA is the left side. Then, points D and C are the bottom-left and bottom-right corners of ABCD. Similarly, rectangle EFGH: since EFGH is a rectangle, let

---------------

's see. The points E, F must be two adjacent corners. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, so

---------------

 the line D-E-C-F must be a straight line. So maybe the rectangles are placed such that one side of EFGH is along the line extending from DC?

Wait, perhaps I should assign coordinates to make this clearer. Let me try that. Let me set coordinate system with point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and if D is (0,0), then since AD = 16 (since BC = AD = 16), then point A would be at (0, 16). Then AB is 107, so point B is at (107, 16), and point C, which is opposite D, would be at (107, 0). Wait, no, hold on. Wait, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. Let me make sure the coordinates are correct.

Let me think again. Let me set point D at (0, 0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, side

---------------

 DC is along the x-axis, so point C is (length of DC, 0). But DC is equal to AB, which is 107. Wait, no

---------------

. Wait, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so AB = CD and BC = AD. Since AB is given as 107, then CD is also 107. BC is 16, so AD is 16. Therefore, if D is at (0,0), then A would be at (0, 16), then moving along AB (which is 107 units) to point B, so point B is at (107, 16), and then point C is at (107, 0). Yes, that makes sense. So coordinates:

D: (0,0)

A: (0,16)

B: (107,16)

C: (107,0)

Now, rectangle EFGH. The points E, F are on the line D-E-C-F. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, and D is (0,0), C is (107,0). So the line D-E-C-F is the x-axis? Wait, but D

---------------

 is at (0,0), C is at (107,0). So the line DC is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (107,0). But the points E and F are also on this line. So E and F must be somewhere along the x-axis between D and C, or beyond? Hmm. The problem doesn't specify their positions. Let me see.

Wait, since EFGH is a rectangle, and EF is 184. EF is one of the sides. So if E and F are on the x-axis, then EF would be a horizontal side. Since EFGH is a rectangle, then FG is vertical or horizontal? Wait, FG is 17. Since FG is another side. Since in rectangles, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So if EF is along the x-axis, then FG would be vertical. Since FG is 17, then the length of FG would be 17, so if F is on the x-axis, then G would be 17 units above or below F. But also, the problem states that points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So point H and G must be positioned such that all four points are on a circle. Hmm, okay.

Let me try to assign coordinates to E and F. Let me denote the coordinates of E as (x, 0) and F as (x + 184, 0), since EF is 184. Wait, but EF is a side of the rectangle EFGH, so EF is either

---------------

 horizontal or vertical. Since E and F are on the x-axis, and the rectangle's sides are perpendicular, then FG would be vertical. So if E is at (e, 0), then F would be at (e + 184, 0), then moving up 17 units to G, so G would be (e + 184, 17), and then H would be at (e, 17). Alternatively, maybe down? But since A, D, H, G are on a circle, maybe the direction matters. Let's suppose that FG is upward, so G is above F.

So let me define coordinates for rectangle EFGH:

Let me let E be at (k, 0). Then since EF is 184, and along the x-axis, F would be at (k + 184, 0). Then, since FG is 17 and perpendicular to EF, so FG would be vertical. Since it's a rectangle, the direction (up or down) can

---------------

 be chosen, but let's assume upwards for now. So G would be at (k + 184, 17), and then H would be at (k, 17). So H is at (k,17), G is at (k+184,17). 

Now, the points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. Let me recall their coordinates:

A is at (0,16)

D is at (0,0)

H is at (k,17)

G is at (k+184,17)

We need these four points to lie on a circle. So we can use the condition that four points lie on a circle by ensuring that the determinant of the following matrix is zero:

|x y x² + y² 1|

for each point. Alternatively, since three points define a circle, the fourth must satisfy the equation. Alternatively, we can use the power of a point or cyclic quadrilateral properties. Hmm, perhaps using coordinates is better here.

Let me write the equation of the circle passing through A(0,16), D(0,0), H(k,17), and G(k+184,17). Let me first find the equation of the circle through A, D, and then see what condition is imposed by H and G.

First, let's find the equation of the circle passing through A(0,16), D(0,0), and let's say H(k,17). Wait, but actually, since we

---------------

 have four points, all four must lie on the same circle. Let me set up equations.

The general equation of a circle is x² + y² + ax + by + c = 0. Let's plug in the points:

For point D(0,0):

0 + 0 + a*0 + b*0 + c = 0 ⇒ c = 0.

So the equation simplifies to x² + y² + ax + by = 0.

Now plug in point A(0,16):

0 + (16)^2 + a*0 + b*16 = 0 ⇒ 256 + 16b = 0 ⇒ 16b = -256 ⇒ b = -16.

So now the equation is x² + y² + ax -16y = 0.

Now, plug in point H(k,17):

k² + (17)^2 + a*k -16*17 = 0 ⇒ k² + 289 + a k - 272 = 0 ⇒ k² + a k + 17 = 0. (Equation 1)

Similarly, plug in point G(k+184,17):

(k + 184)^2 + (17)^2 + a*(k + 184) -16*17 = 0

Let me expand this:

(k² + 368k + 184²) + 289 + a k + 184a - 272 = 0

Wait, let's compute step by step:

First term: (k + 184)^2 = k² + 2*184*k + 184² = k² + 368k + 33856 (since 184 squared is 184*184. Let me compute 180² + 8*180 + 8² = 32400 + 1440 + 64 = 33904? Wait no, 184*184: 180² + 2*180*4 +4²= 32400 + 1440 +16= 33856. Yes.

Second term: (17)^2 = 289.

Third term: a*(k + 184) = a k + 184a.

Fourth term: -16*17 = -272.

So putting all together:

(k² + 368k + 33856) + 289 + (a k + 184a) -272 = 0

Combine like terms:

k² + 368k + 33856 + 289 + a k + 184a - 272 = 0

Compute constants:

33856 + 289 = 34145; 34145 -272 = 33873.

So:

k² + (368k + a k) + (33873) + 184a = 0

Factor the k terms:

k² + k*(368 + a) + 33873 + 184a = 0. (Equation 2)

Now, from Equation 1, which was k² + a k +17 = 0.

Let me write Equation 1: k² + a k = -17.

So, substitute k² + a k = -17 into Equation 2.

Equation 2 becomes:

(k² + a k) + 368k + 33873 + 184a = 0

Substituting (k² + a k) = -17:

-17 + 368k + 33873 + 184a = 0

Simplify constants: -17 + 33873 = 33856

So:

368k + 184a + 33856 = 0

Divide entire equation by 184 to simplify:

(368 / 184)k + (184/184)a + (33856 / 184) = 0

Calculates to:

2k + a + (33856 / 184) = 0

Compute 33856 divided by 184:

Let me see: 184 * 184 is 33856, right? Wait 184*180=33120, plus 184*4=736, so 33120+736=33856. So 33856 / 184 = 184.

Therefore:

2k + a + 184 = 0 ⇒ 2k + a = -184 ⇒ a = -2k -184. (Equation 3)

Now, recall from Equation 1:

k² + a k +17 = 0.

Substitute a from Equation 3 into this:

k² + (-2k -184) *k +17 = 0

Expand:

k² -2k² -184k +17 = 0 ⇒ -k² -184k +17 = 0 ⇒ multiply both sides by -1:

k² + 184k -17 = 0.

So now, we have a quadratic equation in k:

k² + 184k -17 = 0.

Hmm, solving for k here. Let me apply quadratic formula:

k = [-184 ± sqrt(184² + 4*1*17)] / 2.

Compute discriminant:

184² is 33856, plus 4*17=68, so discriminant is 33856 +68 = 33924.

Now sqrt(33924). Let me see if this is a perfect square. Let me compute 184 squared is 33856, so sqrt(33924) is a bit more. Let me see 184.2 squared? Wait, maybe 184.1 squared? Hmm, but maybe exact value.

Wait 184² = 33856, so 33924 - 33856 = 68. So sqrt(33856 + 68) = sqrt(184² + 68). Not a perfect square. Hmm, that's a problem? Maybe I made an error in calculation?

Wait, let me check my steps again. Let me retrace.

We had the four points on the circle: A(0,16), D(0,0), H(k,17), G(k+184,17). The equations led to the quadratic equation in k: k² +184k -17 =0. Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 that's correct. Let me see.

Wait, let's check the equations again step by step.

First, the circle equation through D(0,0), so c=0. Then through A(0,16):

0 + 256 + 0 +16b=0 ⇒ 16b = -256 ⇒ b= -16. Correct.

Then for

---------------

 H(k,17):

k² + 289 + a k -16*17 = 0. 16*17 is 272, so 289 -272 = 17. So equation is k² + a k +17=0. Correct.

Then for G(k+184,17):

(k+184)^2 + 17² + a(k+184) -16*17 =0.

Expanding (k+184)^2 = k² + 368k + 184². Then 17² is 289. Then a(k+184) is a k + 184a. Then -16*17 is -272. So total equation:

k² + 368k + 184² + 289 + a k +184a -272 =0.

Then

---------------

 combining terms: k² + (368k + a k) + (184² +289 -272) + 184a =0.

Wait, 184 squared is 33856, plus 289 is 34145 minus 272 is 33873. So constants are 33873. Then terms:

k² + k*(368 + a) + 33873 +184a =0. Correct.

Then substit

---------------

uting from Equation 1, which was k² + a k = -17, so replacing k² + a k with -17 gives:

-17 + 368k + 33873 +184a =0.

Yes

---------------

, so 368k +184a + (33873 -17)= 368k +184a +33856 =0. Then dividing by 184 gives 2k +a +184=0 ⇒ a= -2k -184. Correct.

Then plugging back into Equation 1: k² + a k +17 =0 ⇒ k² + (-2k -184)k +17 = k² -2k² -184k +17 = -k² -184k +17=0 ⇒ k² +184k -17=0. So that's correct.

Hmm, so the quadratic equation is correct, but the discriminant is 184² +4*17. Let me compute that again.

184 squared is (180+4)^2 = 180² + 2*180*4 +4² = 32400 + 1440 +16 = 33856. Then 4*1*17=68, so discriminant is 33856 +68= 33924. Hmm, sqrt(33924). Let me see if

---------------

 184.2 squared is 33924? Let's see 184*184=33856, so 184.1^2 = (184 +0.1)^2 = 184² +2*184*0.1 +0.01 = 33856 +36.8 +0.01= 33892.81, which is still less. 184.2^2=184^2 +2*184*0.2 +0.2^2=33856 +73.6 +0.04= 33929.64, which is more than 33924. Hmm. So sqrt(33924) is between 184.1 and 184.2. But maybe it's exact?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the equations

---------------

. Let me check once again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I assumed FG is upwards. Maybe FG is downwards? Let me see. If FG is downward, then G would be at (k+184, -17), and H would be at (k, -17). Then points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(k, -17), G(k+184, -17). Maybe this gives a different equation? Let me try that.

Let me redo the coordinates with FG downward.

So if E is at (k,0), F is at (k+184, 0), then FG is downward 17, so G is (k+184, -17), H is (k, -17). Then points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(k, -17), G(k+184, -17). Let me see if this might

---------------

 give a nicer equation.

Proceeding similarly, the circle equation through D(0,0), so c=0, and through A(0,16) gives b=-16 as before.

Then plug in H(k, -17):

k² + (-17)^2 + a k + b*(-17) = 0 ⇒ k² + 289 + a k -16*(-17) ?

Wait, no

---------------

, the general equation is x² + y² + a x + b y =0.

So for H(k, -17):

k² + (-17)^2 + a*k + b*(-17) =0 ⇒ k² + 289 + a k -16*(-17) ?

Wait, b is -16, so substituting:

k² + 289 + a k + (-16)*(-17) ?

Wait, hold on, the equation is x² + y² + a x + b y =0. Since b = -16, then the equation becomes x² + y² + a x -16 y =0.

Therefore, plugging H(k, -17):

k² + (-17)^2 + a*k -16*(-17) =0 ⇒ k² +289 + a k + 272 =0 ⇒ k² + a k + 561 =0 (Equation 1a).

Similarly for G(k + 184, -17):

(k + 184)^2 + (-17)^2 + a*(k +184) -16*(-17) =0.

Compute each term:

(k+184)^2 = k² + 368k + 33856,

(-17)^2 =289,

a*(k +184)= a k +184a,

-16*(-17)=272.

So total equation:

k² +368k +33856 +289 +a k +184a +272 =0.

Combine terms:

k² + (368k + a k) + (33856 +289 +272) +184a =0.

Calculating constants: 33856 +289 is 34145, plus 272 is 34417.

So:

k² +k*(368 +a) +34417 +184a =0. (Equation 2a)

Again, from Equation 1a: k² + a k = -561.

Substitute into Equation 2a:

(k² + a k) + 368k +34417 +184a =0 ⇒ -561 +368k +34417 +184a =0 ⇒

368k +184a + (34417 -561)= 368k +184a +33856 =0.

Same as before, dividing by 184:

2k +a +184 =0 ⇒ a = -2k -184. (Same as Equation 3)

Now plug into Equation 1a: k² + a k +561 =0.

Substituting a:

k² + (-2k -184)k +561 =0 ⇒ k² -2k² -184k +561 =0 ⇒ -k² -184k +561=0 ⇒

Multiply by -1: k² +184k -561=0.

Hmm, now discriminant is 184² +4*1*561.

Compute discriminant: 184² is 33856, plus 4*561=2244 ⇒ total 33856 +2244= 36100.

Ah, sqrt(36100)=190. That's a perfect square. Nice!

So sqrt

---------------

(36100)=190. So solutions:

k = [ -184 ±190 ] /2.

Compute both possibilities:

First, k = (-184 +190)/2 =6/2=3.

Second, k= (-184 -190)/2= -374/2= -187.

Hmm, so two solutions: k=3 and k= -187.

Now, let's consider which one is valid. Let's think about the positions.

First

---------------

, since D is at (0,0), C is at (107,0). The points D,E,C,F are collinear on the x-axis. So E must lie between D and C, or beyond?

Wait, the problem says "drawn such that D,E,C,F are collinear". It doesn't specify the order. So the order could be D-E-C-F or D-C-E-F or E-D-C-F etc. But since E and F are part of the rectangle EFGH, and EF

---------------

=184, which is longer than CD=107. Let me see.

If k=3, then E is at (3,0), so F would be at (3 +184,0)= (187,0). Since C is at (107,0), so the order on the line would be D(0,0)-E(3,0)-C(107,0)-F(187,0). So that's possible. The points D,E,C,F are in order along the x-axis.

Alternatively, if k= -187, then E is at (-187,0), so F would be at (-187 +184,0)= (-3,0). Then the points D(0,0), E(-187,0), C(107,0), F(-3,0). But this

---------------

 ordering would require that the points are arranged as E(-187,0)- ... - D(0,0)-F(-3,0)-C(107,0). Wait, but F would be at -3, which is between D(0) and C(107). Hmm, but the order would be E(-187), then D(0), then F(-3)? That doesn't make sense because F is at -3 which is between D(0) and E(-187)? Wait, no. If E is at -187, F would be at (-187 +184)= -3, so F is to the right of E, but still left of D(0). So the order would be E(-187), F(-3), D(0), C(107). So the four points D,E,C,F would be in the order E(-187), F(-3), D(0), C(107). But the problem states "D,E,C,F are collinear"—they can be in any order as long as they are on the same line. But perhaps both solutions are valid, but we need to check which one satisfies other conditions.

But let's see. The problem says "rectangles ABCD and EFGH are drawn such that D,E,C,F are collinear". Depending

---------------

 on the position, the rectangle EFGH could be on either side. But since A, D, H, G lie on a circle, we need to see which k gives a valid circle.

First, let's consider k=3. Then E is at (3,0), F is at (187,0). G is at (187, -17), H is at (3, -17). Then points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(3,-17), G(187, -17). Do these lie on a circle?

Alternatively, with k=3, let

---------------

's check the circle equation.

Wait, with k=3, let's compute a from equation 3: a= -2k -184= -6 -184= -190.

So the circle equation is x² + y² -190x -16y =0.

Check if G(187, -17) is on this circle:

187² + (-17)^2 -190*187 -16*(-17).

Compute 187²: 187*187. Let me compute 180² + 2*180*7 +7²= 32400 +2520 +49=34969.

(-17)^2=289.

-190*187: 190*187= (200-10)*187=200*187 -10*187=37400 -1870=35530. So -35530.

-16*(-17)=272.

Total: 34969 +289 -35530 +272.

Compute step by step:

34969 +289 = 35258

35258 -35530 = -272

-272 +272 =0. Perfect, so yes, it works.

Similarly check H(3,-17):

3² + (-17)^2 -190*3 -16*(-17) =9 +289 -570 +272 = (9+289)=298; (298 -570)= -272; (-272 +272)=0. Good.

Similarly check A(0,16): 0 +256 -0 -16*16=256 -256=0. Correct.

D(0,0): 0 +0 -0 -0=0. Correct.

So k=3 works.

Now check k=-187.

If k=-187, then E is at (-187,0), F is at (-187 +184,0)= (-3,0). G is at (-3, -17), H is at (-187, -17). Let's see if these four points lie on a circle.

Compute a from equation 3: a= -2*(-187) -184= 374 -184=190.

So the circle equation is x² + y² +190x -16y =0.

Check point G(-3, -17):

(-3)^2 + (-17)^2 +190*(-3) -16*(-17)=9 +289 -570 +272.

Compute: 9+289=298; 298 -570= -272; -272 +272=0. Okay.

H(-187, -17):

(-187)^2 + (-17)^2 +190*(-187) -16*(-17).

187 squared is 34969, so (-187)^2=34969.

(-

---------------

17)^2=289.

190*(-187)= -35530.

-16*(-17)=272.

So total: 34969 +289 -35530 +272.

Same as before: 34969+289=35258; 35258 -35530= -272; -272 +272=0. Correct.

A(0,16):

0 +256 +0 -16*16=256-256=0. Correct.

D(0,0): 0+0+0 -0=0. Correct.

So both k=3 and k=-187 are valid. Hmm. So which one is the correct position?

Now, the problem says "rectangles ABCD and EFGH are drawn such that D,E,C,F are collinear". The problem doesn't specify the order, so both solutions could be possible, but we need to find CE.

CE is the distance between C and E. C is at (107,0). E is either at (3,0) or (-187,0).

So CE would be |107 -3|=104 or |107 - (-187)|= 107+187=294.

But the problem might require the minimal one

---------------

, or perhaps there is a constraint I missed. Wait, let's see.

Looking back at the problem: it says "A, D, H, G all lie on a circle". Both cases satisfy that. The

---------------

 problem doesn't specify any other constraints. So perhaps both are valid, but maybe in the context of the problem, the rectangle EFGH is placed such that it's extending beyond C, so that F is after C on the line. The

---------------

 problem might expect the positive distance. Wait, let's see the given lengths. EF is 184, which is longer than CD (107). If E is before D, then F would be 184 units to the right of E. If E is at -187, then F is at -3, so between D and C. But EF

---------------

 length is 184, which is correct. Alternatively, if E is at 3, F is at 187, which is past C (107,0). So CE

---------------

 would be 104 or 294. Hmm.

Wait, the problem might have an unique answer, so perhaps I need to see which one makes sense in terms of the circle. Wait, but both do. Alternatively, maybe I made an assumption in direction.

Wait in my coordinate system, I assumed that FG was downward. If instead, when I first assumed FG was upward, leading to the equation with discriminant non-integer, but when

---------------

 I flipped it to downward, it worked. So maybe the direction is important? Let me check.

If I had assumed that FG was upward, then G would be at (k+184,17) and H at (k,17). Then the four points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(k,17), G(k+184,17). Let me see if those could lie on a circle.

Wait, with

---------------

 the first approach (assuming upward direction) led to the quadratic with discriminant 33924 which was not a perfect square, leading to messy roots. But when

---------------

 we assumed downward, we got a clean solution. Since the problem didn't specify the direction of the rectangle, perhaps the downward is the correct one since it gives integer solutions, so maybe that's the intended path.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the rectangles are on the same side? Let

---------------

 me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem counts CE as a length, so positive. Both 104 and 294 are positive, but since

---------------

 104 is smaller, maybe that's the answer? Wait, but maybe the problem expects the distance when moving from C to E along the line D-E-C-F. If the order is D-E-C-F, then CE would be C

---------------

 to E is towards D, so negative, but distance is positive. Wait, but if the order is D-E-C-F, then E is between D and C, so CE would be C to E is 

---------------

107 - E's coordinate. Wait, in the case of k=3, E is at (3,0), so CE is 107-3=104. Alternatively, if the order is D-C-E-F, then E is after C, so CE would be 184-107? Wait no, need

---------------

 to see coordinates.

Wait, in the case of k=3, F is at (187,0). So the order on the line is D(0,0), E(3,0), C(107,0), F(187,0). So indeed

---------------

 D-E-C-F in order. So CE is 107-3=104. Alternatively, with k=-187, the points are E(-187,0), F(-3,0), D(0,0), C(107,0). So the order would be E(-187), F(-3), D(0), C(107). So CE here would be the distance from C(107,0) to E(-187,0): 107 - (-187)=294. But the problem says "D,E,C,F are collinear"—they can be in any order as long as they are collinear. But since the problem didn't specify, both could be possible. But since the problem is asking for CE, and in

---------------

 the case of the first solution (k=3) gives a smaller number, maybe that's the answer expected?

Alternatively, maybe there's another constraint. Let me think about the circle again. If the rectangle is drawn with G above the x-axis, then points A(0,16), D(0,0), G(k+184,17), H(k,17). If

---------------

 G is above the x-axis at 17, which is close to A's y-coordinate of 16. Maybe they can lie on a circle. Wait, but in the first calculation (assuming upward direction), the quadratic had non-integer solutions, but maybe

---------------

 it's okay. Wait, but the problem might not require integer coordinates, but the answer is an integer. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I made an error in assuming the direction. Since the problem didn't specify, but given that both solutions are mathematically valid, but the problem is likely expecting the one where E is between D and C, leading to CE=104, which is an answer. Alternatively, the problem might have a unique solution based

---------------

 on the circle condition.

Wait, let me check the problem statement again: "A, D, H, G all lie on a circle". In the case when k=3, H is at (3,-17), G is at (187,-17). So those points are below the x-axis, while A is at (0,16) and D is at (0,0). The circle passes through these four points. Similarly for k=-187, the points H and G are also at -17, so same

---------------

 as the other case. The problem doesn't state any other constraints, so both solutions are possible. However, since the problem is from a competition likely expecting a single answer, maybe I need to check for another

---------------

 condition.

Wait, perhaps the length of CE must be positive, but both are positive. Alternatively, maybe the problem implies that E is between D and C, so that the order is D-E-C-F. Because otherwise, if E is to the left of D, then F would be between D and C, which might complicate the rectangle's position. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes

---------------

 that EFGH is placed such that F is beyond C, so that the collinear points are D-E-C-F in order. If

---------------

 that's the case, then the answer would be 104.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's use of the names of the rectangles' vertices implies a direction. For example, rectangle EFGH: the order of the vertices suggests that after E comes F, so moving from E to F is along the side EF. Since D,E,C,F are collinear, if

---------------

 the order is D-E-C-F, then moving from E to F is away from D, so that makes sense. Alternatively, if the order is E-D-C-F, then moving from E to D would be towards D. Hmm, but the problem just says they are collinear without order.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's diagram (which we don't have) has E between D and C, so the answer is 104. Since 104 is smaller and perhaps the intended answer, and the other case might be a trick, but since

---------------

 both mathematically valid, but maybe the problem expects the first solution. Since in my first assumption, when I thought of the direction, I had

---------------

 to flip to downward to get a nice answer. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the four points A,D,H,G are on a circle in order, making a quadrilateral. If they are in order on the circle, but that

---------------

 might not matter.

Alternatively, let me think of the power of point C with respect to the circle. Wait, maybe overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the answer is 104. Since in the first case, that

---------------

's the answer. Given that in competitions often such problems have unique answers, and since 104 is an integer and the other is 294, which is also integer. Wait, but both are integers. Hmm.

Wait, let me check the problem statement again: Rectangles ABCD and EFGH. The order of the vertices is important for the rectangle's orientation. For rectangle ABCD, the order is A-B-C-D-A, forming a rectangle. Similarly for EFGH: E-F-G-H-E. So if we consider the rectangle EFGH, the sides are EF, FG, GH, HE. So if E is at (k,0), F is at (k+184,0), then G would be at (k+184,17) or (k+184,-17). If

---------------

 it's upward, then H would be at (k,17). If downward, H is at (k, -17). 

Now, the points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. In the case where H and G are above the x-axis (upward direction), then points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(k,17), G(k+184,17). Let me see if this

---------------

 is possible.

Wait, in that case, let me redo the equations with upward direction. Previously when I assumed upward, the quadratic equation had discriminant sqrt(33924). Let me compute that again. sqrt(33924). Let's see, 184^2 =33856, so sqrt(33924)=sqrt(33856+68)=sqrt(33856)+something. Let

---------------

 me see, 184.2^2= (184 +0.2)^2=184² +2*184*0.2 +0.2²=33856 +73.6 +0.04=33929.64. Which is more than 33924. So sqrt(33924) is approximately 184.19. Not an integer. So the solution would be irrational, which is okay, but the problem asks for an integer answer, so maybe that case is invalid? Since the problem states

---------------

 all lengths as integers, perhaps the answer must be integer, so the k must be integer. Since in the downward case, k=3 and k=-187 are integers, but in the upward case, the k would be irrational, so that

---------------

 case is invalid? Wait, but the problem didn't state that the coordinates have to be integers. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires

---------------

 the four points A, D, H, G to lie on a circle, but in the upward case, with k non-integer, but that's still possible. However, the problem asks

---------------

 for an integer answer, so probably expects the downward case where k is integer, giving CE as 104 or 294. But since

---------------

 both k=3 and k=-187 give integer coordinates and integer CE, but the problem might want the smaller one. Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 there's another consideration.

Wait, the problem says "rectangles ABCD and EFGH are drawn such that D,E,C,F are collinear". The order might be important in terms of the rectangle's placement. If EFGH is a rectangle, then the sides must be perpendicular. If E is between D and C, then F is beyond C, so the rectangle EFGH would have F

---------------

 beyond C, and G and H would be above or below. If E is before D, then F is between D and C, so the rectangle EFGH would have part overlapping with ABCD?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem implies that the rectangles are placed such that they don't overlap except possibly at points. If E is between D and C, then EFGH extends beyond C, so no overlapping. If E is before D, then part of EFGH would be to the left of D, but that might be acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 the problem wants the distance CE where E is between D and C, so the answer is 104. Since that's a common case

---------------

. Given that both solutions are valid, but 104 is more likely the answer expected here.

Wait, let me check with k=3, the distance CE is 104. The problem gives BC=16, which is the height of rectangle ABCD. The other rectangle has FG=17, which is its height. Since 17 is close to 16, maybe the downward direction makes their heights "

---------------

opposite" but on the same line, but not sure.

Alternatively, let me compute the power of point C with respect to the circle. Wait, in

---------------

 the case of k=3, the circle equation is x² + y² -190x -16y =0. The point C is (107,0). Let's see if C lies on the circle: plugging into the equation: 107² +0 -190*107 -16*0. 107²=11449; 190*107= 190*100 +190*7=19000+1330=20330. So 11449 -20330 = -8881 ≠0. So C is not on the circle, which is fine because the problem only requires A,D,H,G to be on the circle.

Alternatively, if we consider the other case with k=-187, the circle equation is x² + y² +190x -16y=0. Plugging in C(107,0): 107² +0 +190*107 -0 =11449 + 190*107. 190*100=19000, 190*7=1330 ⇒ total 20330. So 11449 +20330=31779 ≠0. So C is not on the circle either. So that's okay.

Hmm. I think both solutions are valid, but the problem might expect the one where E is between D and C, so CE is 104. Since the problem mentions the order D,E,C,F being collinear, which can be interpreted as the order D-E-C-F, so E between D and C, F beyond C. Therefore, the answer is 104.

Alternatively, maybe I made an error in the direction assumption. Wait, in the downward case, the points H and G are below the x-axis. The problem didn't specify where

---------------

 the rectangles are, so that's acceptable. Alternatively, if I had assumed upward, with k=3, but then the circle equation would have a non-integer k, but the problem allows for any real k. However, since the problem gives integer lengths and asks for an integer answer, the case

---------------

 where k is integer is more plausible.

Therefore, I think the answer is 104.

Wait, but in the case of k=-187, CE is 294, which is also an integer. But which

---------------

 one is correct?

Wait, let me think of the rectangle EFGH with k=-187. Then E is at (-187,0), F at (-3,0), so EF length is 184, which is correct. FG is 17 downward to G(-3,-17), H is at (-187,-17). The rectangle is from

---------------

 E(-187,0) to F(-3,0) to G(-3,-17) to H(-187,-17). Then points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(-187,-17), G(-3,-17) lie on a circle, which we confirmed.

But then CE is the distance from C(107,0) to E(-187,0) which is 107 - (-187)=294. So

---------------

 that's valid. 

Hmm. The problem might have two solutions, but in competitions, sometimes the answer is the smaller one. Alternatively, the problem might have a unique solution, and my error is in the coordinate setup.

Wait, let me check the problem again: "A, D, H, G all lie on a circle." In the case of k=3, H is at (3,-17), G at (187,-17). The points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(3,-17), G(187,-17). Let me see if these four points are concyclic.

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 there's a property I can use here. For four points to be concyclic, the power of point relations must hold. Alternatively, compute the circle's center and radius.

In the case of k=3, the circle equation is x² + y² -190x -16y =0. To find the center and radius, complete the squares:

x² -190x + y² -16y =0.

x² -190x + (190/2)^2 + y² -16y + (8)^2 = (190/2)^2 +8².

So,

(x -95)^2 + (y -8)^2 = 95² +64.

Compute 95²: 90² +2*90*5 +5²=8100+900+25=9025. So 9025 +64=9089.

So the center is at (95,8), radius sqrt(9089). Not sure if that helps, but the points are on the circle.

Alternatively, the

---------------

 problem might require that the points are in convex position or something, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, since the problem mentions rectangles, maybe there is an orth

---------------

ogonality condition. Wait, but rectangles are already orthogonal.

Alternatively, maybe the length of AD is 16, and EH is 17, so close to each other, but I don't see how that helps.

Alternatively, maybe there is a property I'm missing. Let me think differently.

Since A, D, H, G are concyclic, the power of point C with respect to the circle might relate. Wait, but I don't see the connection.

Alternatively, let me consider inversion or other methods, but that might be overkill.

Alternatively, since

---------------

 the problem gives BC=16, which is the side AD, and FG=17, which is EH. Maybe the distance

---------------

 between the centers or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that in rectangle EFGH, the side EH is 17, so if we

---------------

 consider the positions, maybe the vertical distance between the rectangles is 1 or something, but not sure.

Alternatively, let me think of the circle passing through A, D, H, G. The points D and A are on the y-axis. The other two points H and G are on a horizontal line y=17 or y=-17. Let

---------------

 me see for the case of downward direction (y=-17):

Points H(k, -17) and G(k+184, -17). The circle passes through (0,16), (0,0), (k, -17), (k+184, -17). 

The general equation of

---------------

 a circle passing through (0,0) is x² + y² + ax + by =0. 

We found that with b

---------------

=-16, so equation is x² + y² +ax -16y=0.

Then, substituting H and G gives the equations leading to k=3 or -187. 

Since

---------------

 both are valid, and the problem doesn't specify, but since the problem is from a competition expecting a single answer, maybe I need to see which value of CE is possible.

Wait, but

---------------

 the problem says "the length of CE"—length is always positive, so both 104 and 294 are possible. Hmm

---------------

.

Wait, perhaps there is a miscalculation in the quadratic solution?

Wait when k=-187, CE is 107 - (-187)=294, which is correct. But the problem might have a unique solution, so maybe I made a wrong assumption in the coordinate system.

Wait let me try a different approach without coordinates.

Let me consider the power of point C with respect to the circle passing through A, D, H, G.

The power of point C is equal to CA * CB (if C lies outside the circle). Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, since points A, D are on the circle, the power of C with respect to the circle is CO^2 - r^2, where O is the center. But maybe this is too vague.

Alternatively, since AD is a vertical side of rectangle ABCD with length 16, and EH is a vertical side of EFGH with length 17. Since A,D,H,G are concyclic, perhaps there's a relation between the heights.

Alternatively, since

---------------

 AD = 16 and EH =17, which are almost the same, maybe the points are arranged such that the circle's diameter is AD or something, but not sure.

Alternatively, think

---------------

 of the circle passing through A(0,16), D(0,0), which is a vertical line segment of length 16. The other two points H and G are on a horizontal line y=±17, 184 units apart. The circle must pass through these four points.

The circle through A and D has its center along the perpendicular bisector of AD, which is the horizontal line y=8. The center is at (h,8). The distance from center (h,8) to A(0,16) must equal the distance to H(k, -17).

So:

sqrt( (h -0)^2 + (8 -16)^2 ) = sqrt( (h -k)^2 + (8 - (-17))^2 )

Square both sides:

h² + 64 = (h -k)^2 + (25)^2

Expand (h -k)^2 = h² - 2hk +k², 25²=625:

h² +64 = h² -2hk +k² +625

Simplify:

64 = -2hk +k² +625 ⇒

-2hk +k² = 64 -625 ⇒ -2hk +k²= -561 ⇒

k² -2 h k +561=0. (Equation A)

Similarly, the distance from center (h,8) to G(k+184, -17) must equal the radius:

sqrt( (h - (k+184))² + (8 +17)^2 ) = sqrt( h² +64 )

Square both sides:

(h - (k+184))² + 625 = h² +64

Expand left side:

(h -k -184)^2 +625 = h² -2h(k+184) + (k+184)^2 +625

Set equal to h² +64:

h² -2h(k+184) + (k+184)^2 +625 = h² +64

Cancel h²:

-2h(k+184) + (k+184)^2 +625 =64

Rearrange:

-2h(k+184) + (k+184)^2 =64 -625 ⇒

-2h(k+184) + (k+184)^2 = -561 ⇒

Let me factor out (k+184):

(k+184)[ -2h + (k+184) ] = -561 ⇒

(k+184)(k +184 -2h) = -561. (Equation B)

Now, from Equation A: k² -2 h k +561=0 ⇒ rearranged: k² +561 = 2 h k ⇒ h = (k² +561)/(2k)

Plug this into Equation B:

(k+184)[k +184 -2*( (k² +561)/(2k) ) ] = -561

Simplify inside the brackets:

k +184 - (k² +561)/k = [k(k +184) - (k² +561)] /k

Compute numerator:

k² +184k -k² -561 =184k -561.

So the expression becomes:

(k+184)*( (184k -561)/k ) = -561

Multiply both sides by k:

(k+184)(184k -561) = -561k

Expand left side:

k*(184k -561) +184*(184k -561) =

184k² -561k + 184*184k -184*561

Compute terms:

184k² -561k + (184²)k - (184*561)

Combine like terms:

184k² + [ -561 + 184² ]k -184*561

Set equal to -561k:

184k² + [ -561 + 33856 ]k -184*561 = -561k

Simplify coefficients:

184k² + (33295)k -184*561 = -561k

Bring all terms to left side:

184k² +33295k -184*561 +561k =0 ⇒

184k² + (33295 +561)k -184*561 =0 ⇒

184k² +33856k -184*561=0

Factor 184 from first two terms:

184(k² + 184k) -184*561 =0 ⇒

184[ k² +184k -561 ] =0 ⇒

Since 184 ≠0,

k² +184k -561 =0 ⇒ which is the same equation as before.

---------------

 So that checks out.

Thus, the solutions are k= [ -184 ± sqrt(184² +4*561) ]/2 = [ -184 ± sqrt(33856+2244) ]/2 = sqrt(36100)=190, so k=( -184 ±190)/2 ⇒ 3 or -187. So no

---------------

 mistake here.

Therefore, there are two solutions. But the problem says "the length of CE"—so maybe both are acceptable, but the problem might expect the one where E is between D and C, so 104. Since in the problem statement, the order D,E,C,F are collinear, which could be interpreted as the order D-E-C-F, so E between D and C. Hence, the answer is 104.

Thus, I think the answer is 104.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{104}


Given rectangles \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) with \(D, E, C, F\) collinear and \(A, D, H, G\) on a circle, we need to find the length of \(CE\). 

1. **Coordinates Setup**:
   - Rectangle \(ABCD\) has \(D\) at \((0, 0)\), \(A\) at \((0, 16)\), \(B\) at \((107, 16)\), and \(C\) at \((107, 0)\).
   - Rectangle \(EFGH\) has \(E\) at \((k, 0)\), \(F\) at \((k + 184, 0)\), \(G\) at \((k + 184, -17)\), and \(H\) at \((k, -17)\) (assuming downward direction for \(FG\)).

2. **Circle Equation**:
   - The circle passes through \(A(0, 16)\), \(D(0, 0)\), \(H(k, -17)\), and \(G(k + 184, -17)\).
   - The general circle equation is \(x^2 + y^2 + ax + by = 0\).
   - Substituting \(D(0, 0)\) gives \(c = 0\).
   - Substituting \(A(0, 16)\) gives \(b = -16\).
   - Substituting \(H(k, -17)\) and \(G(k + 184, -17)\) leads to solving the quadratic equation \(k^2 + 184k - 561 = 0\).

3. **Solving the Quadratic Equation**:
   - The solutions are \(k = 3\) and \(k = -187\).
   - For \(k = 3\), \(E\) is at \((3, 0)\) and \(CE = 107 - 3 = 104\).
   - For \(k = -187\), \(E\) is at \((-187, 0)\) and \(CE = 107 - (-187) = 294\).

4. **Considering Collinearity Order**:
   - The problem states \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear. The valid order \(D-E-C-F\) implies \(E\) is between \(D\) and \(C\), leading to \(CE = 104\).

Thus, the length of \(CE\) is \(\boxed{104}\).<|im_end|>
