Okay, so I need to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. Let me first make sure I understand the problem correctly.

A number n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:
1. When written in base b, it has exactly two digits. That means n is between b^1 and b^2 - 1, right? Because the first digit (the "tens" place in base b) can be from 1 to b-1, and the second digit (the "units" place) can be from 0 to b-1. So the minimum is b (which is 1*b + 0) and the maximum is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b^2 - 1.

2. The sum of its two digits equals the square root of n. Let me denote the two digits as d1 and d2 (with d1 being the first digit, so d1 ≥ 1 and d2 can be 0 to b-1). Then, according to the problem, d1 + d2 = sqrt(n). But n itself is equal to d1*b + d2. So putting that together, the equation is:

d1 + d2 = sqrt(d1*b + d2)

Our goal is to find for each b ≥ 2, how many such numbers n exist, and find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.

Hmm. So first

---------------

, perhaps I can set up the equation properly and try to find for a given b, how many pairs (d1, d2) satisfy that equation, with d1 from 1 to b-1 and d2 from 0 to b-1.

Let me rewrite the equation:

Let me denote S = d1 + d2. Then S = sqrt(n) = sqrt(d1*b + d2). Squaring both sides gives S² = d1*b + d2. But since S = d1 + d2, we can substitute S into the right-hand side:

S² = d1*b + (S - d1) = d1*(b - 1) + S

Therefore:

S² - S = d1*(b - 1)

So, rearranged:

d1 = (S² - S)/(b - 1)

But d1 has to be an integer between 1 and b-1, and d2 = S - d1 must also be an integer between 0 and b-1.

Therefore, for each possible S (the sum of digits), we can see if (S² - S) is divisible by (b - 1), and then check if d1 and d2 are within their required ranges.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of S. Let me consider possible values of S. Since n = d1*b + d2 must be at least b (since it's a two-digit number in base b). The square root of n is S, so S must be at least sqrt(b). Also, since n is at most b² - 1, S must be at most sqrt(b² - 1) < b. Therefore, S is an integer between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b - 1.

Wait, but S must be an integer because it's the sum of two integers d1 and d2. Therefore, S must be an integer in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1].

Therefore, for each integer S from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1, we can check whether (S² - S) is divisible by (b - 1). If so, then d1 = (S² - S)/(b - 1), and then d2 = S - d1. Then we have to check whether d1 and d2 are valid digits (d1 between 1 and b-1, d2 between 0 and b-1). If so, then that S gives a valid n.

Therefore, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers S in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that:

1. (S² - S) is divisible by (b - 1).

2. d1 = (S² - S)/(b - 1) must satisfy 1 ≤ d1 ≤ b - 1.

3. d2 = S - d1 must satisfy 0 ≤ d2 ≤ b - 1.

Alternatively, perhaps we

---------------

 can think of S as variable, and express b in terms of S and d1? Hmm, maybe not. Let's think step by step.

Alternatively, since S is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1, and S is an integer, perhaps we can iterate

---------------

 over possible S values and see how many solutions exist for each b.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express the equation as S² = d1*b + d2, but since S = d1 + d2, then substituting d2 = S - d1 gives:

S² = d1*b + (S - d1) => S² - S = d1*(b - 1)

Thus, d1 = (S² - S)/(b - 1). Since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, so (S² - S) must be divisible by (b - 1), and the quotient (d1) must be between 1 and b-1.

Therefore, for a given b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers S between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1 such that (S² - S) is divisible by (b - 1) and (S² - S)/(b -1 ) is between 1 and b-1 (so that d1 is in the correct range), and then also ensuring that d2 = S - d1 is between 0 and b-1. But actually, once d1 is in the correct range, since d2 = S - d1, and S is at most b-1, then d2 would be S - d1, so if d1 is between 1 and b-1, then d2 can be as low as S - (b-1). Wait, but S is at most b-1, so S - (b-1) could be negative. Hmm, so perhaps we

---------------

 need to ensure that d2 is non-negative.

Wait, let's see:

Given that d2 = S - d1, and d1 = (S² - S)/(b -1 ), so:

d2 = S - (S² - S)/(b -1 )

Let me compute that:

d2 = S - [S(S -1 )]/(b -1 )

Hmm, this might be messy. Alternatively, perhaps we can note

---------------

 that since d2 must be between 0 and b-1, then S - d1 must be between 0 and b-1. Since d1 is (S² - S)/(b-1), then:

0 ≤ S - (S² - S)/(b -1 ) ≤ b -1

But this might complicate. Maybe it's better to just

---------------

 proceed step by step.

Alternatively, since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, and d2 must be between 0 and b-1, so once

---------------

 we have d1, d2 is determined as S - d1, so as long as d2 is between 0 and b-1, then it's okay.

Therefore, for each S in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1], check if (S² - S) is divisible by (b -1 ), then compute d1 = (S² - S)/(b -1 ), then check if d1 is between 1 and b-1, and d2 = S - d1 is between 0 and b-1. If all these conditions hold, then that S gives a valid n.

Therefore, the problem reduces to for each b, count the number of S in that interval where these conditions hold.

Our

---------------

 goal is to find the minimal b where this count exceeds 10.

Hmm, perhaps we can find a way to parametrize S and b.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe rearrange the equation S² - S = d1*(b -1 )

Let me think of variables:

Let me denote k = b -1, so b = k +1. Then the equation becomes:

S² - S = d1 * k

So, S(S -1 ) = d1 * k

Since

---------------

 d1 must be between 1 and k (since b = k +1, so d1 ≤ k). Therefore, d1 is a positive integer divisor of S(S -1 ), and d1 divides S(S -1 ). Also, k = (S(S -1 )) / d1.

Wait, since k must be an integer (as k = b -1 and b is integer), so (S(S -1 )) must be divisible by d1, and k = (S(S -1 )) / d1 must be equal to b -1. But since b must be at least 2, k is at least 1.

Alternatively, since k = (S(S -1 )) / d1, so for each possible S and d1 (with d1 divides S(S -1 ), and 1 ≤ d1 ≤ k, but since k is (S(S -1 )) / d1, this complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps for given S and d1, b is determined as k +1 = (S(S -1)/d1) +1. But then

---------------

, since b must be at least 2, and S must satisfy the original constraints (ceil(sqrt(b)) ≤ S ≤ b -1 ), this seems a bit circular.

Hmm, maybe I

---------------

 need another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps think of possible S and d1 such that S(S -1 ) is divisible by (b-1 ), and then set b = (S(S -1 ) / d1 ) +1. But then, since

---------------

 b has to be at least S (since S ≤ b -1 ), so b = (S(S-1)/d1 ) +1 ≥ S +1?

---------------

 Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps for a given S and d1, compute b as (S(S-1 )) / d1 +1, but need to ensure that b is an integer and that S is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b -1.

This seems a bit tangled, perhaps it

---------------

's better to try to find for each b, the possible S and count.

Alternatively, maybe we can find for each possible S, the values of b where such a number exists. But I might be overcomplicating.

Alternatively, let's consider that for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers S between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b -1 such that S(S -1) is divisible by (b -1 ), and also

---------------

 that d1 = S(S -1)/(b-1 ) is between 1 and b-1, and d2 = S - d1 is between 0 and b-1.

Alternatively, maybe we

---------------

 can think of S(S -1) must be divisible by (b-1). Let me denote m = b -1, so m divides S(S -1 ). Since m is b-1, and S is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b -1, so S is between roughly sqrt(m +1) and m.

So m divides S(S-1 ), so m | S(S-1 ). So for each m, we can look at numbers S in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m] such that m divides S(S-1 ), and then check the other conditions (d1 and d2 in

---------------

 their ranges). Since m = b -1, so b = m +1, so m can be from 1 upwards (since b ≥2, m ≥1).

Therefore, perhaps re

---------------

phrasing the problem in terms of m (where m = b -1), then the number of solutions for each m is the number of S between ceil(sqrt(m+1)) and m such that m divides S(S-1 ), and also that d1 = S(S -1)/m is between 1 and m, and d2 = S - d1 is between 0 and m (since b = m +1, so digits can be up to m).

Wait, but

---------------

 digits in base b = m +1, so the digits d1 (first digit) must be between 1 and m, and d2 (second digit) between 0 and m. So d1 is exactly S(S-1)/m, so that must be between 1 and m. Similarly, d2 = S - d1 must be between 0 and m.

So for each m ≥1, the number of S in [ceil(sqrt(m +1)), m] such that:

1. m divides S(S-1 )

2. 1 ≤ S(S -1)/m ≤ m

3. 0 ≤ S - S(S -1)/m ≤ m

But

---------------

 let's see if conditions 2 and 3 can be simplified.

Condition 2: 1 ≤ S(S -1)/m ≤ m

Multiply all terms by m (since m is positive):

m ≤ S(S-1) ≤ m²

But S(S-1) is between m and m².

But since S ≤ m, then S(S-1) ≤ m(m-1) < m² (since m(m-1) = m² - m < m²). So the upper bound is automatically satisfied except

---------------

 when m=1? Hmm, but m is at least 1. Wait, when m=1, then b=2. Let me see, but in

---------------

 the problem, b is at least 2, so m starts at 1.

Wait for m=1, then S must be between ceil(sqrt(2)) and 1, but sqrt(2) is about 1.414, so ceil is 2, but m=1, so upper limit is 1, so no solutions. So m=1 gives 0 solutions.

Back

---------------

 to m ≥2.

Condition 2: S(S-1) ≥ m, and S(S-1) ≤ m²

But since S ≤ m, so S(S -1) ≤ m(m -1). Since m(m-1) = m² - m, which is less than m², so the upper bound is automatically satisfied. So the key is that S(S -1) must be at least m.

But

---------------

 S is at least ceil(sqrt(m+1)), so let's see:

Let me see, for S >= ceil(sqrt(m+1)), then S(S-1) is at least (sqrt(m+1)) * (sqrt(m+1) -1 )

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too abstract. Let me try to think of S

---------------

(S-1) must be divisible by m, and S is between ceil(sqrt(m +1)) and m.

Alternatively, perhaps for

---------------

 each m, the possible S are divisors related to m?

Alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions for a given m is equal to the number of divisors of m that lie in some range? Not exactly sure.

Alternatively, let me think of the equation m divides S(S -1). So S and S -1 are consecutive integers, so they are coprime. Therefore, m must divide the product of two coprime numbers S and S -1, so m must be a product of factors that divide S and factors that divide S -1. Since they are coprime, the factors must be separated. Therefore, m can be written as m1*m2 where m1 divides S and m2 divides S -1, and gcd(m1, m2)=1.

Therefore, the solutions for S are numbers such that S ≡0 mod m1 and S ≡1 mod m2, where m1*m2 = m and gcd(m1,m2)=1. But

---------------

 this might be overcomplicating.

Alternatively, for m to divide S(S-1), then either:

- m divides S, so S = k*m, but since S ≤ m, that would require k=1, so S = m, so S(S-1)=m(m-1), which is divisible by m. So S = m is always a solution.

- or m divides S -1, so S = 1 + k*m, but since S ≤ m, then k must be 0, so S=1, but S must be at least ceil(sqrt(m+1)), which is at least 2 for m ≥3 (since sqrt(m+1) when m ≥3 is sqrt(4)=2, so ceil is 2). So S=1 is too small except when m=1 or 2?

Wait, maybe

---------------

 this is not the only way. Since m can be split into factors that divide S and factors that divide S-1.

Alternatively, perhaps for each divisor d of m, set S ≡0 mod d and S ≡1 mod (m/d). But since d and m/d might not be coprime, this might not hold. Hmm.

Alternatively, let's see

---------------

 for a given m, the number of S in [ceil(sqrt(m +1)), m] such that m divides S(S -1). Let me try

---------------

 small m to see a pattern.

Let me try m = 4 (so b=5):

ceil(sqrt(5)) = 3, so S ranges from 3 to 4.

Check S=3: 3*2=6. 6 mod 4 is 2, so not divisible.

S=4: 4*3=12, which is divisible by 4. So yes. So S=4.

Then d1 = 12 /4 = 3. Then d2 =4 -3=1. Check digits: 3 and 1. So n is 3*5 +1=16. sqrt(16)=4. Yes, that works. So 

---------------

16 is 5-eautiful. So for m=4, count is 1.

Hmm, maybe m=5 (b=6):

ceil(sqrt(6))≈2.45, so 3 to 5.

Check S=3: 3*2=6 mod5=1, no.

S=4:4*3=12 mod5=2, no.

S=5:5*4=20 mod5=0, yes. So S=5.

d1=20/5=4. d2=5-4=1. n=4*6 +1=25. sqrt(25)=5. Correct. So count is 1 here too.

Hmm, m=6 (b=7):

ceil(sqrt(7))≈2.64, so 3 to 6.

Check S=3:3*2=6 mod6=0, yes.

So S=3. Then d1=6/6=1, d2=3-1=2. So n=1*7 +2=9. sqrt(9)=3. Correct.

S=4:4*3=12 mod6=0. 12 mod6=0. So yes. Then d1=12/6=2, d2=4-2=2. n=2*7 +2=16. sqrt(16)=4. Correct.

S=5:5*4=20 mod6=20-3*6=2 mod6≠0. Not divisible.

S=6:6*5=30 mod6=0. So yes. d1=30/6=5, d2=6 -5=1. n=5*7 +1=36. sqrt(36)=6. Correct.

So for m=6 (b=7), there are three solutions: S=3,4,6. So count is 3. So that's better.

Wait so m=6 gives 3 numbers.

Wait, so maybe m=8 (b=9):

Let's see m=8:

ceil(sqrt(9))=3, so S from 3 to 8.

Check S=3: 3*2=6 mod8=6≠0.

S=4:4*3=12 mod8=4≠0.

S=5:5*4=20 mod8=4≠0.

S=6:6*5=30 mod8=6≠0.

S=7:7*6=42 mod8= 42-5*8=2≠0.

S=8:8*7=56 mod8=0. So yes.

Thus S=8:

d1=56/8=7, d2=8-7=1. n=7*9 +1=64. sqrt(64)=8. Correct.

So only S=8, so count is 1.

Hmm, so m=6 (b=7) gives 3, which is higher.

Wait m=7 (b=8):

ceil(sqrt(8))≈2.828, so 3 to 7.

Check S=3:3*2=6 mod7=6≠0.

S=4:4*3=12 mod7=5≠0.

S=5:5*4=20 mod7=6≠0.

S=6:6*5=30 mod7=2≠0.

S=7:7*6=42 mod7=0. So yes.

Thus S=7:

d1=42/7=6, d2=1. n=6*8 +1=49. sqrt(49)=7. Correct.

So count is 1 here.

Hmm, m=9 (b=10):

ceil(sqrt(10))≈3.16, so 4 to 9.

Check S=4:4*3=12 mod9=3≠0.

S=5:5*4=20 mod9=2≠0.

S=6:6*5=30 mod9=3≠0.

S=7:7*6=42 mod9=6≠0.

S=8:8*7=56 mod9=2≠0.

S=9:9*8=72 mod9=0. So yes.

d1=72/9=8, d2=9-8=1. n=8*10 +1=81. sqrt(81)=9. Correct.

So count is 1 again.

Hmm, m=10 (b=11):

ceil(sqrt(11))≈3.316, so 4 to 10.

Check S=4:4*3=12 mod10=2≠0.

S=5:5*4=20 mod10=0. So yes.

Thus S=5:

d1=20/10=2, d2=5-2=3. n=2*11 +3=25. sqrt(25)=5. Correct.

S=6:6*5=30 mod10=0. So yes. d1=30/10=3, d2=6-3=3. n=3*11 +3=36. sqrt(36)=6. Correct.

S=7:7*6=42 mod10=2≠0.

S=8:8*7=56 mod10=6≠0.

S=9:9*8=72 mod10=2≠0.

S=10:10*9=90 mod10=0. So yes. d1=90/10=9, d2=10-9=1. n=9*11 +1=100. sqrt(100)=10. Correct.

Thus S=5,6,10. So count is 3.

Hmm, so m=10 (b=11) gives 3.

Hmm, so m

---------------

=6 (b=7) gives 3, m=10 (b=11) gives 3. Let's see m=12 (b=13):

Wait, the problem gives

---------------

 an example with b=13, n=81 (which is 63 in base13). Wait, 6*13 +3 = 81, and 6+3=9, sqrt(81)=9. So indeed, 81 is 13-eautiful. Let's see if for m=12 (b=13):

ceil(sqrt(13))≈3.6, so S from 4 to 12.

Check S=4:4*3=12 mod12=0. So yes.

So S=4:

d1=12/12=1, d2=4-1=3. n=1*13 +3=16. sqrt(16)=4. Correct.

S=5:5*4=20 mod12=8≠0.

S=6:6*5=30 mod12=6≠0.

S=7:7*6=42 mod12=6≠0.

S=8:8*7=56 mod12= 56-4*12=8≠0.

S=9:9*8=72 mod12=0. So yes.

d1=72/12=6, d2=9-6=3. n=6*13 +3=81. Which is the example. Correct.

S=10:10*9=90 mod12=6≠0.

S=11:11*10=110 mod12=110-9*12=110-108=2≠0.

S=12:12*11=132 mod12=0. So yes.

d1=132/12=11, d2=12-11=1. n=11*13 +1=144. sqrt(144)=12. Correct.

So S=4,9,12. Thus count is 3.

Hmm, so m=12 gives 3. Hmm, not

---------------

 yet over 10.

Wait, let's try m= 15 (b=16). Let's see:

ceil(sqrt(16))=4, so S from 4 to 15.

Check S=4:4*3=12 mod15=12≠0.

S=5:5*4=20 mod15=5≠0.

S=6:6*5=30 mod15=0. Yes.

So S=6:

S=13:13*12=156 mod15=156-10*15=6≠0.

S=14:14*13=182 mod15=182-12*15=2≠0.

S=15:15*14=210 mod15=0. Yes.

d1=210/15=14, d2=15-14=1. n=14*16 +1=225. sqrt(225)=15. Correct.

So S=6,10,15. Count is 3 again.

Hmm, so

---------------

 m=15 (b=16) gives 3.

Hmm, perhaps m= 20 (b=21):

ceil(sqrt(21))≈4.58, so S from 5 to 20.

Check S=5:5*4=20 mod20=0. So yes.

d1=380/20=19, d2=20 -19=1. n=19*21 +1=400. sqrt(400)=20. Correct.

Thus S=5,16,20. Count is 3 again.

Hmm, same pattern. Hmm, maybe m=24 (b=25):

ceil(sqrt(25))=5, so S from 5 to 24.

Check S=5:5*4=20 mod24=20≠0.

d1=552/24=23, d2=24-23=1. n=23*25 +1=576. sqrt(576)=24. Correct.

Thus S=9,16,24. Count is 3 again. Hmm.

Hmm, so maybe

---------------

 the count is often 3? But the problem says to find when there are more than ten, so maybe I need to find when the number of solutions increases

---------------

.

Wait, perhaps when m is a multiple of some number?

Alternatively, let me try m=21 (b=22):

ceil(sqrt(22))≈4.69, so S from 5 to21.

Check S=5:5*4=20 mod21=20≠0.

S=6:6*5=30 mod21=9≠0.

S=7:7*6=42 mod21=0. So yes.

d1=420/21=20, d2=21-20=1. n=20*22 +1=441. sqrt(441)=21. Correct.

So S=7,15,21. Count is 3 again.

Hmm, so maybe

---------------

 m= 30 (b=31). Let me see.

ceil(sqrt(31))≈5.56, so S from 6 to 30.

Check S=6:6*5=30 mod30=0. So yes.

S=21:21*20=420 mod30=0. Yes.

d1=420/30=14, d2=21-14=7. n=14*31 +7=441. sqrt(441)=21. Correct.

S=22:22*21=462 mod30=462-15*30=12≠0.

S=30:30*29=870 mod30=0. Yes.

d1=870/30=29, d2=30-29=1. n=29*31 +1=900. sqrt(900)=30. Correct.

So the S values that work here are S=6,10,15,16,21,25,30. Wait, let me recount:

S=6,10,15,16,21,25,30. That's 7 solutions. Wait, so m=30 (b=31) gives 7?

Wait let me check:

For

---------------

 S=6: yes.

S=10: yes.

S=15: yes.

S=16: yes (because 16*15=240, which mod30=0).

S=21: yes.

S=25: yes.

S=30: yes.

So total of 7. Hmm, so m=30 gives 7, which is more than previous counts. So maybe this

---------------

 is increasing?

Wait, so maybe when m is a multiple of several numbers, the count increases. Let me see m= 60 (b=61). Hmm, but that might take too long.

Alternatively, perhaps I

---------------

 need to find when the number of divisors or factors of m is such that there are more S satisfying the conditions.

Alternatively, note that S(S-1) must be divisible by m. Since S and S-1 are coprime, m must divide S*(S-1). Since they are coprime, m must be a product of factors of S and factors of S-1. Since they are coprime, the factors of m must be distributed between S and S-1. Therefore, the number of solutions is

---------------

 equal to the number of ways to split the factors of m between S and S-1.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of m, but this might not be exactly.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps when m has many factors, then there are more S such that m divides S(S-1). Let me try m= 24 (b=25):

Wait, m=24. Let me see if

---------------

 I missed solutions there.

Wait m=24, so b=25. ceil(sqrt(25))=5, so S from 5 to 24.

Check S=5:5*4=20 mod24=20≠0.

S=6:6*5=30 mod24=6≠0.

S=7:7*6=42 mod24=18≠0.

S=8:8*7=56 mod24=8≠0.

S=9:9*8=72 mod24=0. Yes.

d1=72/24=3, d2=9-3=6. n=3*25+6=81. sqrt(81)=9. Correct.

S=10:10*9=90 mod24=18≠0.

S=11:11*10=110 mod24=10≠0.

S=12:12*11=132 mod24=12≠0.

S=13:13*12=156 mod24= 156-6*24=156-144=12≠0.

Wait 156 divided by 24 is 6.5, so mod24 is

---------------

 12.

S=14:14*13=182 mod24=182-7*24=182-168=14≠0.

S=15:15*14=210 mod24= 210-8*24=210-192=18≠0.

S=16:16*15=240 mod24=0. Yes.

d1=240/24=10, d2=16-10=6. n=10*25 +6=256. sqrt(256)=16. Correct.

S=17:17*16=272 mod24=272-11*24=272-264=8≠0.

S=18:18*17=306 mod24=306-12*24=306-288=18≠0.

S=19:19*18=342 mod24=342-14*24=342-336=6≠0.

S=20:20*19=380 mod24=380-15*24=380-360=20≠0.

S=21:21*20=420 mod24=420-17*24=420-408=12≠0.

S=22:22*21=462 mod24=462-19*24=462-456=6≠0.

S=23:23*22=506 mod24=506-21*24=506-504=2≠0.

S=24:24*23=552 mod24=0. Yes.

d1=552/24=23, d2=24-23=1. n=23*25 +1=576. sqrt(576)=24. Correct.

So S=9,16,24. Count=3. Hmm, so even with m=24 (which is divisible by many numbers), still 3.

Hmm, maybe m= 30 gives 7, so that's better. Let me see m= 42 (b=43). Let's see if that can get higher.

But this might take too long. Maybe I need a better approach.

Let me think of the equation S(S-1) divisible by m, and S is between ceil(sqrt(m+1)) and m.

Let

---------------

 me consider S and S-1. Since they are coprime, m must divide S(S-1), so m must be a divisor of S(S-1). So for each m, the number of S in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m] where m divides S(S-1).

Alternatively, for each m, the number of solutions S is equal to the number of integers S in that interval such that S ≡0 mod d and S ≡1 mod (m/d), where d divides m and gcd(d, m/d)=1. Because since m divides S(S-1), and gcd(S,S-1)=1, so d divides S and m/d divides S-1, for some divisor d of m. Since gcd(d, m/d)=1, by

---------------

 Chinese remainder theorem, there is a unique solution modulo m. But since S must be between ceil(sqrt(m+1)) and m, the

---------------

 number of solutions would be the number of divisors d of m where the solution S mod m lies in that interval.

Alternatively, each divisor d of m gives a possible S congruent to 0 mod d and 1 mod (m/d). Since d and m/d are coprime, there is a unique solution mod m. So for each divisor d of m, there is exactly one S mod m satisfying those congruences. So

---------------

 the total number of S in [1, m] satisfying m divides S(S-1) is equal to the number of divisors of m. But since we are only considering S between ceil(sqrt(m+1)) and m, the count is the number of divisors d of m for which the corresponding S is in that interval.

Wait, so the total number of solutions for S in [1,m] is τ(m), the number of positive divisors of m. But we need to count those S in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m].

Therefore, the number of solutions for each m is equal to the number of divisors d of m such that the corresponding S (from the congruence) is in the desired interval.

Hmm, perhaps this is a way to model it. Let me see.

Given a divisor d of m, let me denote d1

---------------

 = d, d2 = m/d. Since gcd(d1, d2)=1 (because we need to split the factors of m into d and m/d such that they are coprime). Wait, not necessarily. Actually, if

---------------

 d divides m, then m = d * k. But for the coprimality, we need that d and k are coprime. So actually

---------------

, the split must be into coprime divisors. Therefore, the number of coprime pairs (d1, d2) with d1*d2=m. Each coprime pair corresponds to a unique way to split the prime factors of m into two coprime parts.

The number of such coprime pairs (d1, d2) is 2^{ω(m)}, where ω(m) is the number of distinct prime factors of m. Because for each prime factor, you decide whether to put it in d1 or d2. But since order matters (d1 and d2 are ordered), but since (d1,d2) and (d2,d1) are different unless d1=d2, but since m must be split into coprime factors, d1 and d2 are unique up to order. Therefore, the number of coprime ordered pairs is 2^{ω(m)}.

But since in our case, the congruence is S ≡0 mod d1 and S≡1 mod d2. Each coprime pair (d1, d2) gives a unique solution modulo m. So the total number of solutions S in [1, m] is exactly 2^{ω(m)}.

Wait, but earlier

---------------

 examples contradict this? Let me check m=6 (b=7). The number of coprime pairs (d1,d2) with d1*d2=6. The prime factors are 2 and 3. So the coprime pairs are (1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1). So 4, which is 2^2. Indeed

---------------

, for m=6, we had 3 solutions. Wait but 2^2 is 4, but in reality there were 3 solutions. Hmm, discrepancy.

Wait let

---------------

's see m=6:

The coprime pairs (d1,d2):

(1,6): S ≡0 mod1 (any S), and S≡1 mod6. So S ≡1 mod6. Solutions between 1 and 6 would be S=1,7,… but since S ≤6, only S=1. But S must be at least ceil(sqrt(7))≈2.64, so S=1 is too low. So this would not count.

(2,3): S ≡0 mod2 and S≡1 mod3. Solve S ≡0 mod2, S≡1 mod3. The solution is S=4 mod6. So S=4 in 1-6.

(3,2): S≡0 mod3 and S≡1 mod2. Solve S≡0 mod3 and S≡1 mod2. Solution S=3 mod6? Let me see: S ≡0 mod3 ⇒ S=3,6,… and S≡1 mod2 ⇒ odd. So S=3 mod6? Let's see: S=3 mod6: 3,9,… but within 1-6, S=3. Check 3 mod2 is 1, yes. So S=3.

(6,1): S≡0 mod6 and S≡1 mod1 (always true). So S≡0 mod6. S=6 in 1-6.

Therefore the solutions are S=3,4,6. So three solutions, which is 2^2 -1? Hmm, but

---------------

 2^{ω(6)} =4. So why discrepancy?

Ah, because when d1 and d2 are 1 and m, the solutions S=1 or S=m. So when d1=1 and d2=m, the solution is S≡0 mod1 (any) and S≡1 mod m ⇒ S≡1 mod m ⇒ S=1 mod m. So in the range 1 to m, S=1. But when

---------------

 d2=1 and d1=m, then S≡0 mod m ⇒ S=m. So for m=6, those give S=1 and S=6. But S=1 is below the required sqrt(m+1)=sqrt(7)≈2.64, so it's excluded. S

---------------

=6 is included.

Therefore, the total solutions are 4 (from the coprime pairs) but two of them (S=1 and S=6) are at

---------------

 the edges. So the total in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m] is 3 (S=3,4,6). So the formula would be the number of coprime pairs minus those solutions which are below the lower bound.

Thus the number of solutions is equal to the number of coprime divisor pairs (d1,d2) where the corresponding S is in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m].

Therefore, to compute the number for a given m:

1. Find all coprime pairs (d1,d2) with d1*d2 = m.

2. For each pair, compute the unique S in [1,m] satisfying S ≡0 mod d1 and S≡1 mod d2.

3. Check if S is in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m].

4. Count how many such S exist.

Thus the number of solutions is equal to the number of coprime pairs (d1,d2) for which the corresponding S is within the desired interval.

Therefore, to maximize the count, we need m with many coprime divisor pairs (i.e., many prime factors) and such that many of the corresponding S values fall into the interval.

Alternatively

---------------

, for m with many distinct prime factors, the number of coprime pairs is 2^{ω(m)}, so higher

---------------

 ω(m) gives more solutions. But we also need that the corresponding S's are in the interval.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing m as a factorial or highly composite number with

---------------

 many small prime factors could yield more solutions.

Alternatively, let me try m= 60 (b=61):

ω(60)=4 (prime factors 2,3,5). So number of coprime pairs is 2^4=16. So potentially 16 solutions, but need to check which S's fall in [ceil(sqrt(61)),60].

sqrt(61)=~7.81, so S from 8 to 60.

This

---------------

 might take a while, but let's see:

First, list all coprime pairs (d1,d2) where d1*d2=60, and gcd(d1,d2)=1.

The coprime pairs are generated by partitioning the prime factors {

---------------

2,3,5} into two subsets. Each prime can go to d1 or d2.

The prime factors are 2,3,5. Each can be in d1 or d2.

Possible partitions:

1. All primes in d1: d1=2*3*5=30, d2=1.

2. 2 and3 in d1, 5 in d2: d1=6, d2=10.

3. 2 and5 in d1,3 in d2: d1=10, d2=6.

4. 3 and5 in d1, 2 in d2: d1=15, d2=4.

5. 2 in d1, 3 and5 in d2: d1=2, d2=30.

6. 3 in d1, 2 and5 in d2: d1=3, d2=20.

7. 5 in d1, 2 and3 in d2: d1=5, d2=12.

8. All primes in d2: d1=1, d2=60.

Also, the reverse of pairs 2-7:

Wait, but since (

---------------

d1,d2) and (d2,d1) are different pairs unless d1=d2, but since m=60 is not a square of a square-free number, so they are distinct.

Wait actually, the above list already includes all possible coprime pairs:

Wait for

---------------

 example, the first one is (30,1), second (6,10), third (10,6), fourth (15,4), fifth (2,30), sixth (3,20), seventh (5,12), eighth (1,60).

So total 8? Wait, but 2^3=8, since ω(m)=3 primes. So yes

---------------

.

Wait, so actually, the number of coprime ordered pairs is 2^{ω(m)}. Here ω(m)=3, so 8 pairs. So perhaps

---------------

 my previous thought was wrong. Let me confirm:

The number of coprime ordered pairs (d1,d2) with d1*d2 = m is 2^{ω(m)}, since each prime can go to d1 or d2. So for m with ω(m)=k, there are 2^k coprime ordered pairs. So for m=60 (ω=3), 8 pairs.

So

---------------

 for each of these 8 pairs, we can compute S.

Let me go through each pair:

1. (d1,d2)=(30,1):

S ≡0 mod30 and S≡1 mod1 (always true). So S≡0 mod30 ⇒ S=30 or 60. Within 1-60, so S=30 and 60. But since S must be between 8 and 60, both qualify. Wait, but the

---------------

 solution mod m=60 is S=30 mod60. So the unique solution in [1,60] is S=30 and 60? Wait no, mod

---------------

 m=60, the solution is S≡0 mod30 and S≡1 mod1 (which is always true). Wait, actually, the congruence is S≡0 mod30 and S≡1 mod1. But mod1 is trivial, so S≡0 mod30. So the solutions in [1,60] are 30 and 60. But since S must be <=60, so S=30 and 60. However, since

---------------

 we need S between 8 and60, both are valid. Wait, but in this case, the pair (30,1) gives two solutions? Wait no, the

---------------

 Chinese remainder theorem would give a unique solution modulo m. Wait, perhaps I'm confused.

Wait, when solving S ≡0 mod30 and S≡1 mod1, but mod1 is trivial, so S can be any number ≡0 mod30. But since mod30 and mod1 are not coprime, the system is S≡0 mod30 and no restriction mod1. So the solutions are all multiples of 30 up to m=60. So two solutions: 30 and 60.

Wait but in our earlier

---------------

 analysis, the coprime pairs give a unique solution modulo m. Hmm, maybe my initial assumption was wrong. Wait, let

---------------

 me recast:

When d1 and d2 are coprime and d1*d2 = m, then the congruences S≡0 modd1 and S≡1 modd2 have a unique solution mod m. So for each coprime pair (d1,d2), there is exactly one S in [1,m].

Therefore, in the case (d1,d2)=(30,1):

We have S≡0 mod30 and S≡1 mod1. Since mod1 is trivial, so the solution is S≡0 mod30. The unique solution in 1-60 is S=30 and 60? Wait but mod60, the solutions are S≡30 mod60? Wait no, because

---------------

 mod30 and mod1. Wait actually, the solution is S≡0 mod30 and S≡1 mod1, but mod1 is always true. So the solution is S≡0 mod30. The solutions modulo 60 are S=30 and 60. But mod60, 30 and 60 are different, but 60 ≡0 mod30, so both

---------------

 are solutions. Hmm, this is conflicting with the earlier idea that there is a unique solution mod m.

Wait, perhaps when d2=1, then S≡1 mod1 is trivial, so the congruence reduces to S≡0 modd1. But since d1*d2=m, so d1= m/d2= m/1= m. Thus S≡0 mod m ⇒ S=m. So in this case, the unique solution is S=m. So for (d1,d2)=(30,1), S=30 is not m

---------------

. Wait m=60, so S=60 is the solution. Wait, perhaps my mistake.

Wait let me recast:

Let me think

---------------

 of (d1,d2) as a coprime pair with d1*d2 = m. Then the congruence is S ≡0 mod d1 and S≡1 mod d2. Since d1 and d2 are coprime, by Chinese Remainder Theorem, there is a unique solution mod m.

So for (d1,d2)=(30,1):

We need S≡0 mod30 and S≡1 mod1. Since mod1 is always true, so S must ≡0 mod30. The unique solution mod60 would be S=30? No, because 30 mod1 is 0≡1? Wait no. Wait mod1 is trivial, so the solution is S≡0 mod30. The smallest positive solution is 30, but mod60, the solutions are 30 and 60. Hmm, confusion here.

Wait maybe I

---------------

 need to use the actual CRT approach.

Let me compute for (d1,d2)=(30,1):

We need S ≡0 mod30 and S≡1 mod1. Since mod1 is trivial, so S can be any ≡0 mod30. The smallest solution in [1,60] is 30 and 60. But according to CRT, since d1 and d2 must be coprime, but d2=1 and d1=30 are coprime. The solution should be unique mod m=60. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait actually

---------------

, S≡0 mod30 and S≡1 mod1. The mod1 condition is S ≡1 mod1 ⇒ 0≡0 mod1, which is always true. So the solution is S≡0 mod30. So the

---------------

 solutions are 30 and 60 in 1-60. But the unique solution mod m=60 is 30 mod60 and 60 mod60=0, but 0 mod30 is also 0 mod60. Hmm, perhaps the

---------------

 solution is S=30 mod60? But then 60 is also a solution. This suggests that when d2=1, the solution is S=d1 mod m?

Wait maybe I need to compute

---------------

 using CRT properly.

Let me take an example with d1=30, d2=1. Then:

We need S ≡0 mod30,

and S ≡1 mod1.

But mod1 is trivial, so S can be any number ≡0 mod30. The solutions in 1-60 are 30 and 60. But since mod

---------------

 m=60, the solution is S≡30 mod60. Because 30 mod30=0 and 30 mod1=0≡1? Wait no. Wait the

---------------

 second congruence is S≡1 mod1, which is always true, so any S is okay. So actually, the solution is not unique mod m. Hmm, so perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe when d2=1, then the congruence S≡1 mod1 is trivial, so the solution is S≡0 modd1, which gives multiple solutions modulo m. But

---------------

 since d1*d2 = m, so d1 = m/d2 = m/1 = m. Wait, no. If d1*d2 = m, then d1=30 and d2=1 must satisfy 30*1=30≠60. Wait that contradicts. Wait no

---------------

, I think I messed up the pairs.

Wait earlier for m=60, the coprime pairs (d1,d2) must satisfy d1*d2 =60 and gcd(d1,d2)=1.

So for example, (d1,d2)=(30,2) would not be coprime. Wait,

---------------

 let me list them again properly:

Wait the correct coprime pairs (d1,d2) with d1*d2=60 and gcd(d1,d2)=1 are:

The prime factors of 60 are 2,3,5. Each prime must be entirely in d1 or d2.

Possible assignments:

- 2,3,5 all in d1: d1=2*3*5=30, d2=1

- 2,3 in d1; 5 in d2: d1=6, d2=10 (but gcd(6,10)=2≠1). Wait, no, that's not coprime.

Wait, actually

---------------

, if I put 2 and3 in d1, then d1=6, and d2 must get 5, so d2=10. But 6 and10 have a common factor of 2, so they are not coprime. Oops, my mistake.

Ah, right, so actually

---------------

 when you split the prime factors, you have to assign each prime to either d1 or d2, but not both. So for example, if you put 2 in d1, then d2 can't have 2. So in

---------------

 order for d1 and d2 to be coprime, the primes must be entirely in one or the other.

Therefore, the correct coprime pairs are:

1. All primes in d1: d1=30, d2=1.

2. 2 and3 in d1, 5 in d2: but that would make d1=6, d2=10, which are not coprime. So invalid.

Wait, no, to

---------------

 have coprime, the split must be such that for each prime, it is in exactly one of d1 or d2.

Thus the possible coprime pairs are:

1. Assign each prime to d1 or d2 such that all

---------------

 primes in d1, none in d2: d1=60, d2=1. But 60 and1 are coprime.

Wait, but

---------------

 earlier I thought of d1=30 and d2=2, but that's not coprime. Wait, perhaps I need to list

---------------

 all possible coprime pairs:

Let me think of the prime factors 2,3,5. Each can go to d1 or d2, but not both.

The possible coprime pairs (d1,d2):

- All primes in d1: d1=2×3×5=30, d2=1.

Wait no, 2×3×5 is 30, so 30×2=60? No, 30×2=60? Wait, no, d1*d2 must be 60.

Wait if all primes are in d1, then d1=60, d2=1.

Wait,

---------------

 no, if all primes are in d1, then d1=2×3×5=30? Wait no, 2×3×5 is 30, but 30×2=60. Wait, confusion

---------------

.

Wait, m=60=2^2×3×5. Wait, no, actually 60 factors as 2²×3×5. So the prime factors with exponents are 2², 3¹, 5¹.

Wait

---------------

, but when splitting into coprime d1 and d2, we have to assign each prime power to one of d1 or d2.

Therefore

---------------

, for each prime, decide whether to put its entire exponent in d1 or d2. So for prime 2 (with exponent 2), it

---------------

 can go to d1 or d2. Similarly for primes 3 and5.

Therefore, the coprime pairs (d1,d2) are formed

---------------

 by assigning each prime (with its exponent) to d1 or d2, such that d1*d2 = m.

Therefore, for prime 2: assign to d1 or d2.

Prime3: assign to d1 or d2.

Prime5: assign to d1 or d2.

Thus, there are 2^3=8 coprime pairs.

Let me list them:

1. Assign all primes to d1: d1=2²×3×5=60, d2=1.

2. Assign primes 2 and3 to d1, 5 to d2:

d1=2²×3=12, d2=5. Then

---------------

 d1*d2=12×5=60.

3. Assign primes 2 and5 to d1,3 to d2:

d1=2²×5=20, d2=3.

4. Assign primes3 and5 to d1, 2 to d2:

d1=3×5=15, d2=2²=4.

5. Assign prime2 to d1, primes3 and5 to d2:

d1=2²=4, d2=3×5=15.

6. Assign prime3 to d1, primes2 and5 to d2:

d1=3, d2=2²×5=20.

7. Assign prime5 to d1, primes2 and3 to d2:

d1=5, d2=2²×3=12.

8. Assign all primes to d2: d1=1, d2=60.

These

---------------

 are the 8 coprime pairs.

Now, for each pair, compute S ≡0 mod d1 and S≡1 mod d2, find S in 1-60, then check if it's in [8,60].

Let me go through each pair:

1. (60,1):

S ≡0 mod60 and S≡1 mod1 ⇒ S≡0 mod60. Solutions are S=60. Since S must be between 8 and60, so yes. Count +=1.

2. (12,5):

S ≡0 mod12 and S≡1 mod5.

Find S ≡0 mod12 ⇒ S=12a.

Also, 12a ≡1 mod5 ⇒ 12a ≡ 2a ≡1 mod5 ⇒ 2a ≡1 ⇒ a≡3 mod5 (since 2*3=6≡1 mod5).

Thus a=3+5k. The smallest a is3, so S=12×3=36.

Next a=8 would give S=96>60. So only S=36.

Check 36 is between8 and60: yes. Count +=1.

3. (20,3):

S ≡0 mod20 and S≡1 mod3.

S=20a. 20a ≡1 mod3 ⇒ 20≡2 mod3 ⇒ 2a ≡1 mod3 ⇒ a≡2 mod3 (since 2*2=4≡1 mod3).

Thus a=2,5,8,… but

---------------

 S must be ≤60.

a=2 ⇒ S=40.

a=5 ⇒ S=100>60. So only S=40.

Check 40 is in range: yes. Count +=1.

4. (15,4):

S≡0 mod15 and S≡1 mod4.

S=15a. 15a ≡1 mod4 ⇒ 15≡3 mod4 ⇒ 3a ≡1 mod4 ⇒ a≡3 mod4 (since 3*3=9≡1 mod4).

a=3 ⇒ S=45.

a=7 ⇒ S=105>60. Only 45. In range: yes. Count +=1.

5. (4,15):

S≡0 mod4 and S≡1 mod15.

S=4a. 4a ≡1 mod15 ⇒ 4a ≡1 mod15 ⇒ a≡4^{-1} mod15. 4*4=16≡1 mod15 ⇒ inverse is4.

Thus a≡4 mod15 ⇒ a=4,19,34,… S=4×4=16; 4×19=76>60. So only S=16.

Check 16 is in range: yes. Count +=1.

6. (3,20):

S≡0 mod3 and S≡1 mod20.

S=3a. 3a ≡1 mod20 ⇒ 3a≡1 mod20 ⇒ a≡7 mod20 (since 3×7=21≡1 mod20).

Thus a=7 ⇒ S=21.

a=27 ⇒ S=81>60. Only S=21. In range: yes. Count +=1.

7. (5,12):

S≡0 mod5 and S≡1 mod12.

S=5a. 5a ≡1 mod12 ⇒ 5a≡1 mod12 ⇒ a≡5^{-1} mod12. 5×5=25≡1 mod12 ⇒ inverse is5.

Thus a≡5 mod12 ⇒ a=5 ⇒ S=25; a=17 ⇒ S=85>60. Only S=25. In range: yes. Count +=1.

8. (1,60):

S≡0 mod1 (any) and S≡1 mod60 ⇒ S≡1 mod60. Solutions in 1-60 are S=1 and61 (but 61>60). So S=1. But 1 <8, so not counted. Count +=0.

Thus total solutions:

1 (from pair1) +1+1+1+1+1+1+0 =7.

So for m=60 (b=61), the count is 7.

Hmm, but

---------------

 earlier for m=30 (b=31), we had 7. Hmm.

Wait let's try m= 240 (b=241). Maybe that's too big, but let me think.

Alternatively, maybe m= 120 (b=121). Let's see.

Wait m=120 has prime factors 2^3×3×5. So ω(m)=3 (primes 2,3,5). So number of coprime pairs is 2^3=8? Wait no, ω(m)=3, so 2^3=8. Wait but the

---------------

 exponents don't matter for ω.

Wait, let me compute m=120.

Prime factors are 2,3,5 (same as 60). So ω(m)=3, so number of coprime pairs is 8. But since

---------------

 exponents are higher for 2, but in splitting, the entire prime must be assigned to one side. So the coprime pairs would be similar but with higher exponents.

Alternatively, perhaps m= 360 (b=361). Hmm, but this might take too long.

Alternatively, maybe m= 210 (b=211), which is 2×3×5×7. ω=4, so 2^4=16 coprime pairs.

Let

---------------

 me see if m=210 gives a higher count.

But this is getting time-consuming. Perhaps there's a better way.

Alternatively, note

---------------

 that each coprime pair (d1,d2) gives a solution S in [1,m]. The question is how many of those S are ≥ceil(sqrt(m+1)).

The minimal S from the coprime pairs is the

---------------

 minimal solution from the congruences.

Alternatively, for each coprime pair (d1,d2), the solution S is the

---------------

 smallest positive solution to S≡0 modd1 and S≡1 modd2.

This S can be found via CRT. The solution is S = d1*k + (

---------------

some offset). The minimal solution is S = (d1*( (1 - a)/d1 mod (d2) ) ) ?

---------------

 Not sure.

Alternatively, the solution can be written as S = d1*t + 0, and also S = d2*s +1. So:

d1*t = d2*s +1 ⇒ d1*t - d2*s =1.

This is a Diophantine equation. The minimal solution in t and s will give the minimal S.

Alternatively, the minimal S is the solution to the congruence,

---------------

 which can be computed as follows:

Find x such that x ≡0 modd1 and x ≡1 modd2.

Let x = d1 * k.

Then d1*k ≡1 modd2 ⇒ k ≡d1^{-1} modd2.

Thus k = d1^{-1} modd2 + m*d2.

Thus the minimal k is the inverse of d1 modd2, so the minimal x is d1*(d1^{-1} modd2).

Wait, let me see with an example.

Take the pair (d1,d2)=(12,5) from m=60:

We need x≡0 mod12 and x≡1 mod5.

Compute

---------------

 k such that 12k ≡1 mod5 ⇒12k mod5 ≡2k≡1 mod5 ⇒k≡3 mod5. So minimal k=3. Thus x=12*3=36, which matches earlier result.

Similarly, for pair (d1=15, d2=4):

Find x≡0 mod15 and x≡1 mod4.

x=15k.

15k ≡1 mod4 ⇒15 mod4=3 ⇒3k≡1 mod4 ⇒k≡3 mod4. Minimal k=3 ⇒x=45.

So

---------------

 the minimal S for each pair is d1 multiplied by the inverse of d1 modd2.

Thus the minimal S is (d1 * (inv(d1 modd2))) mod (m). Wait, but need

---------------

 to ensure it's positive.

Therefore, the minimal S for each coprime pair (d1,d2) is:

S = d1 * (inv(d1 modd2)) mod (d1*d2). Since d1 and d2 are coprime.

Thus

---------------

, the solution S is in [1, m], and for each pair, the S is unique.

To count how many of these S are ≥ ceil(sqrt(m+1)), we need to compute for each coprime pair the S and check.

However

---------------

, doing this manually for large m is tedious.

Alternatively, maybe the maximum number of solutions occurs when m is a factorial or a product of many small primes, leading

---------------

 to more coprime pairs, hence more solutions.

Alternatively, perhaps m= 210 (2×3×5×7) with ω=4, so 16 coprime pairs. Let's see how many solutions might

---------------

 exist.

But this requires computation.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 256? Wait, but I need to think differently.

Alternatively, notice

---------------

 that for m= (k^2 -k), since S(S-1)=k^2 -k. If m divides S(S-1), then if

---------------

 m divides (S(S-1)), so for S=k, then S(S-1)=k(k-1), so m divides k(k-1). So if we set m =k(k-1), then S=k would be a solution.

Similarly

---------------

, S= m would always be a solution since m divides m*(m-1).

Thus, for m =k(k-1), we have at least two solutions: S=k and S=m.

Additionally, there might be other solutions.

Alternatively

---------------

, if m is a product of consecutive integers, like 6=2×3, 12=3×4, etc.

Alternatively, let

---------------

's consider m= 24 (b=25). We had 3 solutions.

Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, let me consider m= 240 (b=241). ω(m)=4 (primes 2,3,5), since 240=2^4×3×5.

Thus, the number of coprime pairs would be 2^3=8 (since ω=3 primes). Wait, primes

---------------

 are 2,3,5. So ω=3. So 2^3=8 pairs.

Wait, even with higher exponents, the number of coprime pairs is still based on the number of distinct primes.

Thus, m

---------------

=240 would have same number as m=60.

Hmm.

Alternatively, m= 840 (b=841). Prime factors 2^3×3×5×7. So ω=4, so 16 coprime pairs.

Perhaps

---------------

 with more coprime pairs, there could be more solutions.

But this is getting too time-consuming.

Perhaps I need to think of another approach.

Let me consider the equation:

S(S -1) must be divisible by m = b-1.

Thus

---------------

, m divides S(S-1).

Also, S must be between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1.

The number of such S is equal to the number of integers S in that interval where m divides S(S-1).

To

---------------

 have more than ten solutions, we need many S in that interval where m divides S(S-1).

To maximize the number of such S, m should have many divisors, so that S(S-1) is divisible by m for many S.

Alternatively, if m is 1, but b=2, which gives no solutions.

Alternatively, let me consider m= 24 (b=25):

We have 3 solutions. So

---------------

 to get over ten, m needs to have at least 11 solutions.

Wait, but for m= 24, it

---------------

's 3.

Wait maybe m= 60 (b=61) gives 7 solutions, as above.

m= 840 would give more?

Alternatively, let me try m= 120 (b=121):

Prime factors 2^3×3×5. So ω=3, so 8 coprime pairs.

Let me compute the solutions:

The coprime pairs (d1,d2):

1

---------------

. d1=120, d2=1 ⇒ S=120.

2. d1= (2^3×3)=24, d2=5 ⇒ S≡0 mod24 and ≡1 mod5.

Find S=24k ≡1 mod5 ⇒24k≡4k≡1 mod5 ⇒k≡4^{-1} mod5 ⇒4×4=16≡1 ⇒k≡4 mod5 ⇒k=4 ⇒S=24×4=96.

3. d1= (2^3×5)=40, d2=3 ⇒ S≡0 mod40 and ≡1 mod3.

40k ≡1 mod3 ⇒40≡1 mod3 ⇒1*k≡1 ⇒k=1 ⇒S=40.

4. d1= (3×5)=15, d2=8 (since d1*d2=120, and d1=15 ⇒d2=8).



---------------

S≡0 mod15 and ≡1 mod8.

15k≡1 mod8 ⇒15≡7 mod8 ⇒7k≡1 mod8 ⇒k≡7^{-1} mod8 ⇒7×7=49≡1 ⇒k≡7 mod8 ⇒k=7 ⇒S=15×7=105.

5. d1=8, d2=15 ⇒ S≡0 mod8 and ≡1 mod15.

S=8k≡1 mod15 ⇒8k≡1 ⇒k≡2 mod15 (since 8×2=16≡1 mod15). Thus k=2 ⇒S=16.

6. d1=3, d2=40 ⇒ S≡0 mod3 and ≡1 mod40.

S=3k ≡1 mod40 ⇒3k≡1 ⇒k≡27 mod40 (since 3×27=81≡1 mod40). Thus k=27 ⇒S=81.

7. d1=5, d2=24 ⇒ S≡0 mod5 and ≡1 mod24.

S=5k≡1 mod24 ⇒5k≡1 ⇒k≡5^{-1} mod24. 5×5=25≡1 ⇒k≡5 mod24 ⇒k=5 ⇒S=25.

8. d1=1, d2=120 ⇒ S≡0 mod1 and ≡1 mod120 ⇒ S=1 (too small).

Now, check which of these S are ≥ceil(sqrt(121))=11:

S values: 120,96,40,105,16,81,25.

All except 16,25 are ≥11? Wait:

Wait:

120: yes

96: yes

40: yes

105: yes

16: yes (16 ≥11)

81: yes

25: yes

So all except S=1 (from d1=1,d2=120) are ≥11. Thus total solutions are 7 (since S=1 is excluded). Wait but let

---------------

 me list them:

From the 8 pairs, excluding the last one (S=1):

The S values are: 120,96,40,105,16,81,25. That's 7 solutions. So same as m=60 and m=30.

Hmm.

Hmm, so perhaps m= 210 (b=211) with ω=4, so 16 coprime pairs.

Let me try m=210:

Prime factors 2×3×5×7.

Thus, the coprime pairs are 2^4=16 pairs.

Let me pick

---------------

 a few pairs to see:

Pair1: d1=210, d2=1 ⇒ S=210.

Pair2: d1=2×3×5=30, d2=7 ⇒ S≡0 mod30, S≡1 mod7.

S=30k ≡1 mod7 ⇒30 mod7=2 ⇒2k≡1 mod7 ⇒k≡4 mod7 ⇒k=4 ⇒S=120.

Pair3: d1=2×3×7=42, d2=5 ⇒ S≡0 mod42 and ≡1 mod5.

S=42k ≡1 mod5 ⇒42 mod5=2 ⇒2k≡1 ⇒k≡3 mod5 ⇒k=3 ⇒S=126.

Pair4: d1=2×5×7=70, d2=3 ⇒ S≡0 mod70, ≡1 mod3.

S=70k ≡1 mod3 ⇒70 mod3=1 ⇒k≡1 mod3 ⇒k=1 ⇒S=70.

Pair5: d1=3×5×7=105, d2=2 ⇒ S≡0 mod105 and ≡1 mod2.

S=105k ≡1 mod2 ⇒105 is odd ⇒105k mod2= k mod2 ≡1 ⇒k odd. Minimal k=1 ⇒S=105.

Pair6: d1=2×3=6, d2=35 (since 35=5×7, and coprime with6). S≡0 mod6, ≡1 mod35.

S=6k ≡1 mod35 ⇒6k≡1 ⇒k≡6^{-1} mod35. 6×6=36≡1 ⇒k≡6 mod35 ⇒k=6 ⇒S=36.

Pair7: d1=2×5=10, d2=21 ⇒ S≡0 mod10 and ≡1 mod21.

S=10k ≡1 mod21 ⇒10k≡1 ⇒k≡10^{-1} mod21. 10×10=100≡16, 10×19=190≡190-8×21=190-168=22≡1 mod21? No. Wait 10×2=20≡-1 mod21 ⇒ 10×(-2)= -20≡1 mod21 ⇒k≡-2 mod21 ⇒k=19 ⇒S=10×19=190.

Pair8: d1=2×7=14, d2=15 ⇒ S≡0 mod14, ≡1 mod15.

S=14k ≡1 mod15 ⇒14k≡-k≡1 ⇒k≡-1 mod15 ⇒k=14 ⇒S=14×14=196.

Pair9: d1=3×5=15, d2=14 ⇒ S≡0 mod15 and ≡1 mod14.

S=15k ≡1 mod14 ⇒15 mod14=1 ⇒k≡1 mod14 ⇒k=1 ⇒S=15.

Pair10: d1=3×7=21, d2=10 ⇒ S≡0 mod21 and ≡1 mod10.

S=21k ≡1 mod10 ⇒21 mod10=1 ⇒k≡1 mod10 ⇒k=1 ⇒S=21.

Pair11: d1=5×7=35, d2=6 ⇒ S≡0 mod35 and ≡1 mod6.

S=35k ≡1 mod6 ⇒35 mod6= -1 ⇒-k≡1 ⇒k≡-1≡5 mod6 ⇒k=5 ⇒S=175.

Pair12: d1=2, d2=105 ⇒ S≡0 mod2 and ≡1 mod105.

S=2k ≡1 mod105 ⇒2k≡1 ⇒k≡53 mod105 ⇒k=53 ⇒S=106.

Pair13: d1=3, d2=70 ⇒ S≡0 mod3 and ≡1 mod70.

S=3k ≡1 mod70 ⇒3k≡1 ⇒k≡47 mod70 (since 3×47=141≡1 mod70). Thus S=3×47=141.

Pair14: d1=5, d2=42 ⇒ S≡0 mod5 and ≡1 mod42.

S=5k ≡1 mod42 ⇒5k≡1 ⇒k≡25 mod42 (5×25=125≡1 mod42). Thus S=5×25=125.

Pair15: d1=7, d2=30 ⇒ S≡0 mod7 and ≡1 mod30.

S=7k ≡1 mod30 ⇒7k≡1 ⇒k≡13 mod30 (7×13=91≡1 mod30). Thus S=7×13=91.

Pair16: d1=1, d2=210 ⇒ S≡0 mod1 and ≡1 mod210 ⇒ S=1 (too small).

Now, the S values are:

210, 120, 126, 70, 105, 36, 190, 196,15,21,175,106,141,125,91.

Now, we need S ≥ ceil(sqrt(211))≈14.5, so S ≥15.

Check each:

210: yes

120: yes

126: yes

70: yes

105: yes

36: yes (≥15)

190: yes

196: yes

15: exactly 15, yes.

21: yes

175: yes

106: yes

141: yes

125: yes

91: yes

So all except S=1 qualify. So total solutions are 15.

Wait, that

---------------

's 15 solutions. Since there are 16 pairs, subtracting the one S=1 gives 15 solutions. So for m=210 (b=211), there are 15 b-eautiful numbers, which is more than ten.

Is

---------------

 there a smaller m where the count exceeds ten?

Let me check m= 120 (b=121) had 7 solutions.

m= 180 (b=181). Let me see:

Prime factors 2²×3²×5. So ω=3 (primes 2,3,5). Thus 8 coprime pairs.

But

---------------

 maybe with higher exponents, but the number of coprime pairs is same.

Alternatively, m= 168 (b=169). 168=2^3×3×7. ω=3 primes, so 8 pairs.

Let me compute m=168:

Prime factors 2,3,7. So coprime pairs:

Possible assignments:

Each prime to d1 or d2.

1

---------------

. d1=168, d2=1 ⇒ S=168.

2. d1= (2^3×3)=24, d2=7 ⇒ S≡0 mod24 and 1 mod7.

24k≡1 mod7 ⇒24 mod7=3 ⇒3k≡1 ⇒k=5 ⇒S=24×5=120.

3. d1= (2^3×7)=56, d2=3 ⇒ S≡0 mod56 and ≡1 mod3.

56k ≡1 mod3 ⇒56 mod3=2 ⇒2k≡1 ⇒k=2 ⇒S=112.

4. d1= (3×7)=21, d2=8 ⇒ S≡0 mod21 and ≡1 mod8.

21k≡1 mod8 ⇒21 mod8=5 ⇒5k≡1 ⇒k=5 ⇒S=105.

5. d1=8, d2=21 ⇒ S≡0 mod8 and ≡1 mod21.

S=8k≡1 mod21 ⇒8k≡1 ⇒k≡8^{-1} mod21. 8×8=64≡1 mod21 ⇒k=8 ⇒S=64.

6. d1=3, d2=56 ⇒ S≡0 mod3 and ≡1 mod56.

S=3k≡1 mod56 ⇒3k≡1 ⇒k≡19 mod56 ⇒k=19 ⇒S=57.

7. d1=7, d2=24 ⇒ S≡0 mod7 and ≡1 mod24.

S=7k≡1 mod24 ⇒7k≡1 ⇒k≡7^{-1} mod24. 7×7=49≡1 ⇒k=7 ⇒S=49.

8. d1=1, d2=168 ⇒ S=1 (too small).

So S values:

168,120,112,105,64,57,49.

All except 1 qualify (S≥ceil(sqrt(169))=13):

All are

---------------

 ≥13 except maybe 49? No, all are ≥49.

Wait 49 is 49, which is ≥13.

Thus total solutions are 7 again.

Hmm, so m=168 gives 7.

Back to m=210 gives 15, which is over ten. Let me check if there's a smaller m.

How about m= 84 (b=85):

Prime factors 2²×3×7. ω=3, so 8 pairs.

Compute:

1. d1=84, d2=1 ⇒ S=84.

2. d1= (2²×3)=12, d2=7 ⇒ S≡0 mod12 and ≡1 mod7.

12k≡1 mod7 ⇒12 mod7=5 ⇒5k≡1 ⇒k=3 ⇒S=36.

3. d1= (2²×7)=28, d2=3 ⇒ S≡0 mod28 and ≡1 mod3.

28k≡1 mod3 ⇒28 mod3=1 ⇒k≡1 ⇒S=28.

4. d1= (3×7)=21, d2=4 ⇒ S≡0 mod21 and ≡1 mod4.

21k≡1 mod4 ⇒21 mod4=1 ⇒k≡1 ⇒S=21.

5. d1=4, d2=21 ⇒ S≡0 mod4 and ≡1 mod21.

6. d1=3, d2=28 ⇒ S≡0 mod3 and ≡1 mod28.

S=3k≡1 mod28 ⇒3k≡1 ⇒k≡19 mod28 ⇒k=19 ⇒S=57.

7. d1=7, d2=12 ⇒ S≡0 mod7 and ≡1 mod12.

S=7k≡1 mod12 ⇒7k≡1 ⇒k≡7^{-1} mod12 ⇒7×7=49≡1 ⇒k=7 ⇒S=49.

8. d1=1, d2=84 ⇒ S=1 (too small).

S values: 84,36,28,21,64,57,49.

Check ≥ceil(sqrt(85))≈9.2 ⇒10.

All except 21, 28,36 are ≥10? 21 is 21 ≥10, yes. 28,36 also yes.

Thus all 7 solutions qualify. Total 7.

Hmm.

Next

---------------

, m= 180 (b=181):

Prime factors 2²×3²×5. ω=3, so 8 pairs.

Compute:

1. d1=180, d2=1 ⇒ S=180.

2. d1= (2²×3²)=36, d2=5 ⇒ S≡0 mod36 and ≡1 mod5.

36k≡1 mod5 ⇒36 mod5=1 ⇒k≡1 ⇒S=36.

3. d1= (2²×5)=20, d2=9 ⇒ S≡0 mod20 and ≡1 mod9.

20k≡1 mod9 ⇒20 mod9=2 ⇒2k≡1 ⇒k=5 ⇒S=100.

4. d1= (3²×5)=45, d2=4 ⇒ S≡0 mod45 and ≡1 mod4.

45k≡1 mod4 ⇒45 mod4=1 ⇒k≡1 ⇒S=45.

5. d1=4, d2=45 ⇒ S≡0 mod4 and ≡1 mod45.

S=4k≡1 mod45 ⇒4k≡1 ⇒k≡34 mod45 ⇒k=34 ⇒S=136.

7. d1=5, d2=36 ⇒ S≡0 mod5 and ≡1 mod36.

S=5k≡1 mod36 ⇒5k≡1 ⇒k≡29 mod36 ⇒k=29 ⇒S=145.

8. d1=1, d2=180 ⇒ S=1 (too small).

S values: 180,36,100,45,136,81,145.

All are ≥ceil(sqrt(181))≈13.45 ⇒14.

All are ≥14 except 36 and45? 36 is 36≥14, yes. 45 also yes. So total 7 solutions.

Hmm.

So

---------------

 going back to m=210 (b=211) gives 15 solutions, which is over ten. But maybe there's a smaller m.

Let me check m= 180 (no). Next, m= 210 is the first with 15.

Wait, let me check m= 120 (b=121) had 7, m= 180 had7, m=240 (b=241) would be similar to m=60,

---------------

 which had 7.

Wait m= 360 (b=361). Prime factors 2^3×3^2×5. ω=3 primes, so 8 pairs.

Hmm

---------------

, but still 8 pairs.

Wait m= 210 is the first with ω=4, giving 16 pairs. So likely

---------------

 the first m with over ten solutions is m=210 (b=211).

But let me check m= 120 with 7, m= 180 with7, m= 210 with15.

Wait but

---------------

 let me check m= 840 (b=841). Prime factors 2^3×3×5×7. ω=4, so 16 pairs.

If

---------------

 I compute for m=840, perhaps it gives even more solutions, but since the problem asks for the least b, so m

---------------

=210 is smaller than m=840.

But before that, let me check m= 105 (b=106):

Prime factors 3×5×7. ω=3, so 8 pairs.

Let me compute:

1. d1=105, d2=1 ⇒ S=105.

2. d1= (3×5)=15, d2=7 ⇒ S≡0 mod15 and ≡1 mod7.

15k≡1 mod7 ⇒15 mod7=1 ⇒k=1 ⇒S=15.

3. d1= (3×7)=21, d2=5 ⇒ S≡0 mod21 and ≡1 mod5.

21k≡1 mod5 ⇒21 mod5=1 ⇒k=1 ⇒S=21.

4. d1= (5×7)=35, d2=3 ⇒ S≡0 mod35 and ≡1 mod3.

35k≡1 mod3 ⇒35 mod3=2 ⇒2k≡1 ⇒k=2 ⇒S=70.

5. d1=3, d2=35 ⇒ S≡0 mod3 and ≡1 mod35.

S=3k≡1 mod35 ⇒3k≡1 ⇒k≡12 mod35 ⇒k=12 ⇒S=36.

6. d1=5, d2=21 ⇒ S≡0 mod5 and ≡1 mod21.

S=5k≡1 mod21 ⇒5k≡1 ⇒k≡17 mod21 ⇒k=17 ⇒S=85.

7. d1=7, d2=15 ⇒ S≡0 mod7 and ≡1 mod15.

S=7k≡1 mod15 ⇒7k≡1 ⇒k≡13 mod15 ⇒k=13 ⇒S=91.

8. d1=1, d2=105 ⇒ S=1 (too small).

S values:105,15,21,70,36,85,91.

Check ≥ceil(sqrt(106))≈10.3 ⇒11.

All except 15 are ≥11. So total solutions: 6.

Hmm, not enough.

Thus

---------------

, m=210 (b=211) gives 15 solutions. Let me see if there's a smaller m with ω=4.

The smallest m with ω=4 is 2×3×5×7=210. So that's the first m with 4 distinct primes. Thus, m=210 is the smallest m with ω=4, so it's the first m

---------------

 with 16 coprime pairs. Thus, the corresponding b is 211.

Wait, but let me check m= 105 (ω=3), m= 210 is the first with ω=4. Thus, the

---------------

 minimal b is 211. But wait the problem asks for the least b where the count exceeds ten. Since m=210 gives 15, which is over ten, and there are no smaller m with ω≥4.

Wait, but wait

---------------

 m= 132? Let me think. 132=2²×3×11. ω=3 primes, so still 8 pairs.

Hmm, so I

---------------

 think m=210 is indeed the first.

Therefore, the minimal b is 211. But wait the problem example uses b=13. Let me confirm.



---------------

Wait the problem says "Find the least integer b ≥ 2 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers."

But according to my analysis, the first such b is 211. But that seems very large, and the problem might have a smaller answer. Maybe my approach is wrong.

Wait let me check m= 24 (b=25) had 3 solutions, m=60 had7, m=120 had7, m=210 had15. So between m=60 and m=210, there's a jump. Maybe there is an m between 60 and 210 that has more than ten?

Let me check m= 120 had 7.

Hmm, let me check m= 180 had7.

Wait m= 180 (

---------------

b=181):

Wait, let me recalculate m= 180:

Earlier I had 7 solutions, but let me re

---------------

check.

Wait m=180, the coprime pairs are:

1. (180,1) ⇒ S=180.

2. (36,5): S=36.

3. (20,9): S=100.

4. (45,4): S=45.

5. (4,45): S=136.

6. (9,20): S=81.

7. (5,36): S=145.

So total of 7 solutions.

Hmm.

Wait let me think of m= 210 as

---------------

 the first to have more than ten solutions. Thus the minimal b is 211.

But the problem might have a smaller answer. Maybe I missed a case.

Alternatively, perhaps m= 120 is

---------------

 not the only one with 7, but let me think of m= 240 (b=241):

Prime factors 2^4×3×5. ω=3, so 8 pairs.

Compute:

1. d1=240, d2=1 ⇒ S=240.

2. d1= (2^4×3)=48, d2=5 ⇒ S≡0 mod48 and ≡1 mod5.

48k≡1 mod5 ⇒48 mod5=3 ⇒3k≡1 ⇒k=2 ⇒S=96.

3. d1= (2^4×5)=80, d2=3 ⇒ S≡0 mod80 and ≡1 mod3.

80k≡1 mod3 ⇒80 mod3=2 ⇒2k≡1 ⇒k=2 ⇒S=160.

4. d1= (3×5)=15, d2=16 ⇒ S≡0 mod15 and ≡1 mod16.

15k≡1 mod16 ⇒15≡-1 ⇒-k≡1 ⇒k=15 ⇒S=225.

5. d1=16, d2=15 ⇒ S≡0 mod16 and ≡1 mod15.

S=16k≡1 mod15 ⇒16≡1 ⇒k≡1 ⇒S=16.

6. d1=3, d2=80 ⇒ S≡0 mod3 and ≡1 mod80.

S=3k≡1 mod80 ⇒3k≡1 ⇒k≡27 mod80 ⇒k=27 ⇒S=81.

7. d1=5, d2=48 ⇒ S≡0 mod5 and ≡1 mod48.

S=5k≡1 mod48 ⇒5k≡1 ⇒k≡19 mod48 ⇒k=19 ⇒S=95.

8. d1=1, d2=240 ⇒ S=1 (too small).

Thus S values:240,96,160,225,16,81,95.

Check ≥ceil(sqrt(241))≈15.5 ⇒16.

All except 16 qualify? 16 is exactly 16, so yes.

Thus total solutions: 7 (since 16 is included). So still 7.

Hmm.

Wait

---------------

 perhaps m= 210 is indeed the first to have more than ten solutions. So the minimal b is 211.

But the problem says "more than ten", so 11 or more. m=210 gives 15, so that works. Is

---------------

 there a smaller m with ω=4?

The next smallest after 210 would be 2×3×5×11=330. But that's larger.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting for m=210.

Let me recount for m=210 (b=211):

The S values were:

210,120,126,70,105,36,190,196,15,21,175,106,141,125,91.

Wait that's 15 numbers. Let me count:

1. 210

2. 120

3. 126

4. 70

5. 105

6. 36

7. 190

8. 196

9.15

10.21

11.175

12.106

13.141

14.125

15.91

Yes, 15 solutions. So that's more than ten.

Now, is there a smaller m with more than ten?

Let me check m= 168 (no), m= 180 (no), m= 210 is the first.

Wait another candidate

---------------

: m= 840 (b=841) would have more, but it's larger.

Alternatively, let me check m= 120 (

---------------

b=121):

Wait, m= 120, which has 7 solutions. Not enough.

Hmm.

Wait maybe

---------------

 I missed m= 132 (b=133):

Prime factors 2²×3×11. ω=3, so 8 pairs.

Compute:

1. d1=132, d2=1 ⇒ S=132.

2. d1= (2²×3)=12, d2=11 ⇒ S≡0 mod12 and ≡1 mod11.

12k≡1 mod11 ⇒12 mod11=1 ⇒k=1 ⇒S=12.

3. d1= (2²×11)=44, d2=3 ⇒ S≡0 mod44 and ≡1 mod3.

44k≡1 mod3 ⇒44 mod3=2 ⇒2k≡1 ⇒k=2 ⇒S=88.

4. d1= (3×11)=33, d2=4 ⇒ S≡0 mod33 and ≡1 mod4.

33k≡1 mod4 ⇒33 mod4=1 ⇒k=1 ⇒S=33.

5. d1=4, d2=33 ⇒ S≡0 mod4 and ≡1 mod33.

S=4k≡1 mod33 ⇒4k≡1 ⇒k≡25 mod33 ⇒k=25 ⇒S=100.

6. d1=3, d2=44 ⇒ S≡0 mod3 and ≡1 mod44.

S=3k≡1 mod44 ⇒3k≡1 ⇒k≡15 mod44 ⇒k=15 ⇒S=45.

7. d1=11, d2=12 ⇒ S≡0 mod11 and ≡1 mod12.

S=11k≡1 mod12 ⇒11k≡1 ⇒k≡11 mod12 ⇒k=11 ⇒S=121.

8. d1=1, d2=132 ⇒ S=1 (too small).

S values:132,12,88,33,100,45,121.

Check ≥ceil(sqrt(133))≈11.5 ⇒12.

All except 12 qualify? 12 is exactly 12, which is ≥12. So total solutions:

132,12,88,33,100,45,121. That's 7 solutions.

Hmm.

So

---------------

 yes, m=210 is the first with over ten. So the answer should be 211.

Wait but wait, let me check m= 182 (b=183). Hmm

---------------

, prime factors 2×7×13. ω=3, so 8 pairs.

But probably still 7 solutions.

Alternatively, maybe m= 2310 (the product of first few primes), but that's way larger.

Alternatively, maybe my initial assumption is wrong and the answer is smaller.

Wait let me think differently.

Suppose m

---------------

 is a triangular number. Let me see.

Triangular numbers are of the form k(k+1)/2. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 m is a factorial. Let me see m=6 (b=7): 3 solutions.

m=24 (b=25):3 solutions.

m=120 (b=121):7 solutions.

m=720 (b=721): ω=4 (primes 2,3,5), so 8 pairs.

Wait, no, 720=2^4×3^2×5. ω=3 primes.

Hmm.

Alternatively, let me think of m= 120 (b=121):

Wait, I

---------------

 think the minimal is indeed 211. Thus the answer is 211. But the problem says "Find the least integer b ≥ 2", so \

---------------

boxed{211} would be the answer.

Wait but maybe I made a mistake in counting for m=210. Let me recheck.

For m=210 (b=211):

The coprime pairs are all possible splits of primes 2,3,5,7 between d1 and d2.

The solutions S are:

1. (210,1): S=210.

2. (2×3×5=30,7): S≡0 mod30 and 1 mod7 ⇒30k≡1 mod7 ⇒30 mod7=2 ⇒2k≡1 ⇒k=4 ⇒S=120.

3. (2×3×7=42,5): S≡0 mod42 and 1 mod5 ⇒42k≡1 mod5 ⇒42 mod5=2 ⇒2k≡1 ⇒k=3 ⇒S=126.

7. (2×5=10,21): S≡0 mod10 and 1 mod21 ⇒10k≡1 mod21 ⇒k=19 ⇒S=190.

8. (2×7=14,15): S≡0 mod14 and 1 mod15 ⇒14k≡1 mod15 ⇒-k≡1 ⇒k=14 ⇒S=196.

9. (3×5=15,14): S≡0 mod15 and 1 mod14 ⇒15k≡1 mod14 ⇒15 mod14=1 ⇒k=1 ⇒S=15.

10. (3×7=21,10): S≡0 mod21 and 1 mod10 ⇒21k≡1 mod10 ⇒k≡9 mod10 ⇒k=9 ⇒S=189? Wait no, earlier calculation said 21. Wait let me recalculate:

Wait pair (3×7=21, d2=10):

S≡0 mod21 and 1 mod10 ⇒21k ≡1 mod10 ⇒21 mod10=1 ⇒k≡1 mod10 ⇒k=1 ⇒S=21×1=21. Correct.

11. (5×7=35,6): S≡0 mod35 and 1 mod6 ⇒35k≡1 mod6 ⇒35 mod6= -1 ⇒-k≡1 ⇒k=5 mod6 ⇒k=5 ⇒S=175.

12. (2, 105): S≡0 mod2 and 1 mod105 ⇒2k≡1 mod105 ⇒k=53 ⇒S=106.

13. (3,70): S≡0 mod3 and 1 mod70 ⇒3k≡1 mod70 ⇒k=47 ⇒S=141.

14. (5,42): S≡0 mod5 and 1 mod42 ⇒5k≡1 mod42 ⇒k=25 ⇒S=125.

15. (7,30): S≡0 mod7 and 1 mod30 ⇒7k≡1 mod30 ⇒k=13 ⇒S=91.

16. (1,210): S=1.

Yes, total 15 solutions. All except S=1 qualify, so 15 solutions. Thus, b=211 is the first with more than ten.

Therefore, the answer is \boxed{211}.

But wait, the

---------------

 problem says "more than ten", so 11 or more. So 15 qualifies. So the minimal b is 211.

But I need

---------------

 to check if there is a smaller b.

Wait m= 180 (b=181) had7.

m= 210 is next. So yes, 211 is the minimal b.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{211}


To solve the problem, we need to find the least integer \( b \geq 2 \) such that there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful integers. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-eautiful if it has exactly two digits in base \( b \) and the sum of its digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

### Key Steps:

1. **Understanding \( b \)-eautiful Numbers**:
   - A \( b \)-eautiful number \( n \) in base \( b \) has digits \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \), so \( n = d_1 \cdot b + d_2 \).
   - The sum of the digits \( d_1 + d_2 \) must equal \( \sqrt{n} \).

2. **Formulating the Equation**:
   - Let \( S = d_1 + d_2 \). Then \( S = \sqrt{n} \), so \( S^2 = n = d_1 \cdot b + d_2 \).
   - Substituting \( d_2 = S - d_1 \) gives \( S^2 = d_1 \cdot b + (S - d_1) \), leading to \( S(S - 1) = d_1 \cdot (b - 1) \).

3. **Conditions for Validity**:
   - \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \) must be valid digits in base \( b \), i.e., \( 1 \leq d_1 \leq b-1 \) and \( 0 \leq d_2 \leq b-1 \).
   - \( S \) must be an integer between \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \) and \( b-1 \).

4. **Finding \( b \) with More Than Ten Solutions**:
   - For each \( m = b - 1 \), we need to count the number of integers \( S \) such that \( m \) divides \( S(S - 1) \) and the resulting digits \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \) are valid.
   - The number of solutions is related to the number of coprime pairs of divisors of \( m \).

5. **Checking Specific Values**:
   - After extensive calculations and analysis, it was found that \( m = 210 \) (i.e., \( b = 211 \)) is the smallest value where the number of solutions exceeds ten. This is because \( m = 210 \) has four distinct prime factors (2, 3, 5, 7), leading to 16 coprime pairs and 15 valid solutions.

### Conclusion:
The least integer \( b \geq 2 \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful integers is \(\boxed{211}\).<|im_end|>
