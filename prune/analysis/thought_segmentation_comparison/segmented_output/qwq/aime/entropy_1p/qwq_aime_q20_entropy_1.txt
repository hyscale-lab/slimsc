Okay, so I need to find the smallest base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. Let me first make sure I understand what a b-eautiful number is. 

The problem says a positive integer n is b-eautiful if two conditions are met: first, when n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. The example given is 81 being 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6+3=9, which is the square root of 81. 

Alright, so let me formalize this. If n is a two-digit number in base b, then n can be written as n = a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, the first digit a must be at least 1 and less than b, and the second digit c must be between 0 and b-1, inclusive. The key equation here is that a + c = sqrt(n). 

So substituting n = a*b + c into the equation, we have a + c = sqrt(a*b + c). Let me write that down:

a + c = sqrt(a*b + c)

Hmm, maybe

---------------

 I can square both sides to eliminate the square root. Let's try that.

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Expanding the left side gives:

a² + 2ac + c² = a*b + c

Let me rearrange this equation to collect like terms. Subtract a*b + c from both sides:

a² + 2ac + c² - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, perhaps I

---------------

 can rearrange terms:

a² + (2c - b)a + (c² - c) = 0

Hmm, this is a quadratic equation in terms of a, with coefficients depending on c and b. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of variables a and c, and see

---------------

 if there's a way to parameterize solutions.

Alternatively, maybe I can express this equation as:

a² + 2ac + c² = a*b + c

Then, moving everything to the left:

a² + 2ac + c² - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, maybe factor terms with a:

a² + a*(2c - b) + (c² - c) = 0

This is a quadratic equation in a. For a to be an integer, the discriminant must be a perfect square. Let's compute the discriminant D:

D = (2c - b)^2 - 4*1*(c² - c) 

Let me compute that:

D = 4c² - 4b c + b² - 4c² + 4c

Simplify terms:

The 4c² cancels with -4c², so we have:

D = -4b c + b² + 4c 

Hmm, so D = b² -4b c +4c 

Hmm, so discriminant D must be a perfect square for a to be integer. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this. Let me think again.

Let me consider that n = a*b + c, and sqrt(n) = a + c. So n = (a + c)^2. Therefore, we have:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

So, rearranged:

a*b = (a + c)^2 - c

Therefore

---------------

,

a*b = a² + 2a c + c² - c

Wait, that's the same equation as before, so maybe this

---------------

 isn't helpful. Alternatively, since n = (a + c)^2, then n must be a perfect square. That's an important point. So all b-eautiful numbers must be perfect squares. 

Therefore, the

---------------

 problem reduces to finding perfect squares n such that when written in base b as two digits (i.e., between b and b² - 1), their digits sum to their square root. 

So, given

---------------

 that n is a perfect square, let me denote sqrt(n) = s, so that n = s². Then the two digits in base b must satisfy a + c = s, and n = a*b + c. Since n = s², then:

s² = a*b + c

But since a + c = s, so c = s - a. Substitute that into the equation:

s² = a*b + (s - a)

S

---------------

implify:

s² = a*b + s - a

Bring all terms to one side:

s² - s = a*(b - 1)

So,

a = (s² - s)/(b - 1)

Hmm, interesting. Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1 (since it's the first digit in base b), and c must be between 0 and b-1. Also, since c = s - a, then c must also satisfy 0 ≤ c ≤ b -1, so s - a must be in that interval. 

So, from the equation above, a must equal (s² - s)/(b -1). Since a must be an integer, this tells us that (b -1) must divide (s² - s). 

Therefore, for each possible s, the base b can be such

---------------

 that (b -1) divides (s² - s). Let me see if this is helpful. 

Alternatively, since we need to find for a given b, how many such numbers n exist. Since n is a two-digit number in base b, n must be between b (since 10_b is b in decimal) and b² -1 (since the maximum two-digit number in base b is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b² -1). 

So n is in [b, b² -1], and n must be a perfect square. Let me denote s = sqrt(n). Then s must satisfy s² is in [b, b² -1], so s is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and floor(sqrt(b² -1)). Since sqrt(b² -1) is less than b, so floor(sqrt(b² -1)) is b -1. Therefore s ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b -1. 

Therefore, for each s from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b -1, we can check if (s² - s) is divisible by (b -1). Then a would be (s² - s)/(b -1), and then c = s - a. 

Moreover

---------------

, the digits a and c must satisfy 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1. Since a is already (s² - s)/(b-1), so we need to check whether a is within 1 to b-1 and c = s - a is within 0 to b-1. 

So for each s in that range, if (s² - s) is divisible by (b-1), then compute a and check the constraints. Each such valid (a, c) pair corresponds to a unique n = s², so each valid s gives a unique n. 

Therefore, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers s between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b -1 such that (s² - s) is divisible by (b -1), and the digits a and c satisfy their constraints. 

So

---------------

 our goal is to find the smallest b ≥2 such that the number of such s is greater than 10. 

Hmm, so perhaps it's better to approach this problem by considering

---------------

 for a given b, how many s satisfy the conditions. Let's try to formalize this. 

Let me denote that

---------------

 for a given b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that (s² - s) is divisible by (b -1), and when

---------------

 a = (s² - s)/(b-1), then c = s - a must be between 0 and b-1. 

Alternatively, since c = s - a = s - (s² - s)/(b-1). Let me compute that:

c = s - (s² - s)/(b -1) 

Let me factor s from numerator:

c = s [1 - (s -1)/(b -1)] 

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, let me compute c:

c = s - [ (s(s -1)) / (b -1) ]

Hmm

---------------

, perhaps it's better to note that since a must be at least 1, so (s² - s)/(b -1) ≥1, so s(s-1) ≥ (b -1). Also, since a must be less than b, then (s² -s)/(b -1) < b. 

So:

(s² - s) / (b -1) < b ⇒ s² - s < b(b -1)

Similarly, since c = s - a must be ≥0, so s - (s² - s)/(b -1) ≥0 ⇒ 

s ≥ (s² - s)/(b -1)

Multiply both sides by (b-1) (assuming b >1, which it is):

s(b -1) ≥ s² - s

Bring all terms to left:

s(b -1) - s² + s ≥0 ⇒ 

-s² + s(b -1 +1) ≥0 ⇒ 

-s² + s b ≥0 ⇒ 

s(-s + b) ≥0 ⇒ 

Since s is positive, this implies that -s + b ≥0 ⇒ s ≤ b. 

But since s is at most b-1, that's okay. So that condition is automatically satisfied. 

The

---------------

 other condition is c ≤ b-1. Let's see:

c = s - a = s - (s² -s)/(b -1) ≤ b -1

So:

s - [ (s² - s)/(b -1) ] ≤ b -1

Multiply both sides by (b-1):

s(b -1) - (s² - s) ≤ (b -1)^2

Left side:

s(b -1) - s² + s = s b - s - s² + s = s b - s²

Therefore:

s b - s² ≤ (b -1)^2

Rearranged:

-s² + s b - (b -1)^2 ≤0 ⇒ 

Multiply by -1 (inequality reverses):

s² - s b + (b -1)^2 ≥0 

Hmm, let's see if this is always true. Let me compute the discriminant of the quadratic in s:

Discriminant D = b² -4*1*(b -1)^2 = b² -4(b² - 2b +1 ) = b² -4b² +8b -4 = -3b² +8b -4 

Hmm, this

---------------

 is getting complicated. Maybe instead of trying to handle the inequality algebraically, perhaps it's better to note that for c to be ≤ b-1, since c = s - a and a is (s² -s)/(b-1). 

Alternatively, perhaps instead

---------------

 of dealing with inequalities, since we can just compute for each s, the value of a and c and check if they are valid digits. 

But since we need to find the minimal b where there are more than ten such numbers, maybe we can find a formula for the number of s for

---------------

 each b. 

Alternatively, perhaps think of s as a variable and see for which b, the equation (s² - s) divisible by (b-1) gives multiple s. Let me think differently. 

Let me consider that (b -1) divides s(s -1). So for each s, the divisors of s(s -1) are the possible (b -1). Since s and s-1 are coprime (consecutive integers), their GCD is 1. Therefore, the divisors of s(s-1) are products of divisors of s and divisors of s-1. 

Thus, for each s, the possible values of (b -1) must be a divisor of s(s-1). Therefore, for a given b-1 = d, which is a divisor of s(s-1), then s must be such that d divides s(s-1). 

Alternatively, if

---------------

 we fix d = b -1, then the number of s such that d divides s(s -1) and s is between ceil(sqrt(d +1)) and (d). Because since s must be up to b-1 = d. Wait, since

---------------

 s is up to b-1, and b = d +1, so s up to d. 

Wait, let me rephrase. Let me set d = b -1. Then b = d +1. So the range of s is ceil( sqrt(b) ) to b -1, which is ceil( sqrt(d +1) ) to d. 

Therefore, for each d (which is b -1), the number of s between ceil( sqrt(d+1) ) and d such that d divides s(s-1). 

Our goal is to find the minimal d +1 (since b = d +1) such that the number of such s is greater than 10. 

Therefore, the

---------------

 problem reduces to finding the smallest d ≥1 such that the number of integers s in [ceil( sqrt(d+1) ), d] where d divides s(s-1) is greater than 10. Then b = d +1. 

Hmm, okay. So perhaps it

---------------

's better to think in terms of d instead of b. Let me proceed with that. 

First, note that s and s-1 are coprime, so d divides s(s-1) implies that d must divide the product of two coprime numbers, so d must be a product of factors of s and factors of s-1. Since they are coprime, the factors of d must partition between s and s-1. 

Therefore, for each s in the interval, either:

- d divides s, or 

- d divides s-1, or 

- factors of d divide s and the complementary factors divide s-1. 

But this might complicate. Alternatively, since d divides s(s -1), each prime factor of d must divide either s or s -1. 

Alternatively, perhaps for

---------------

 each d, we can count the numbers s in the interval [ceil( sqrt(d +1)), d] such that s ≡0 mod d or s ≡1 mod d? Wait no, that would only be if d divides s or s-1, but d divides s(s-1) can be in

---------------

 other ways too. For example, if d has factors that divide s and others divide s-1. 

Hmm, perhaps it's better to note that s mod d can be any residue, but the product s(s -1) mod d must be 0. Therefore, s ≡0 mod d or s ≡1 mod d. Wait, actually, if s ≡0 mod d, then s(s-1) ≡0 mod d. Similarly, if s ≡1 mod d, then s-1 ≡0 mod d. However, if s is congruent to something else mod d, but d factors into parts

---------------

 that divide s and parts that divide s-1. But since s and s-1 are coprime, the factors of d must divide either s or s-1 but not both. 

Therefore, the solutions s mod d are exactly those where s ≡0 mod d or s ≡1 mod d. Wait, is that true? Let me think. Suppose d has a prime p dividing it. Then p divides s or p divides s-1, but since s and s-1 are coprime, each prime factor of d must divide exactly one of s or s-1. Therefore, for each prime factor of d, we can choose whether it divides s or s-1, but the combined

---------------

 congruence must hold. 

However, the total number of solutions s mod d where d divides s(s-1) is exactly the number of solutions to s ≡0 mod p_i or s≡1 mod p_i for each prime p_i dividing d. Wait

---------------

, perhaps more systematically, using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. 

Alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions s mod d is 2^k, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of d. However, this might not be precise. 

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 the number of solutions s mod d to s(s-1) ≡0 mod d is equal to the number of divisors of d? Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think of an example. 

Take d = 6. Then s(s -1) ≡0 mod 6. The solutions mod 6 would be s ≡0 or 1 mod 2 and mod 3. 

Wait, let

---------------

's compute:

s(s-1) ≡0 mod 6. 

This requires that s ≡0 mod 2 or s ≡1 mod 2, and s ≡0 mod 3 or s ≡1 mod3. Wait, actually, no

---------------

. Let me think again. 

Wait, s(s-1) must be divisible by 2 and by 3. 

To be divisible by 2: either s even or s-1 even, which is always true, since one of two consecutive numbers is even. Similarly, for divisibility by 3: either s ≡0 mod3 or s≡1 mod3. So the

---------------

 condition is that s ≡0 or1 mod3. 

Thus, the solutions mod 6 are numbers congruent to 0,1,3,4 mod6. 

Indeed, check

---------------

 s=0 mod6: s=0 mod6 ⇒ divisible by 2 and 3. 

s=1 mod6: 1 mod6 ⇒ s-1=0 mod6.

s=3 mod6: divisible by 3, so s divisible by 3, but mod2: 3 is odd, so s-1 even, so 

---------------

3 mod6 is okay.

s=4 mod6: 4 mod6 ⇒ s-1 =3 mod6, which is divisible by 3. 

So total

---------------

 solutions mod6: 4 solutions. 

So 2^2=4, since 6 has two distinct prime factors. So perhaps

---------------

 in general, for square-free d with k distinct prime factors, the number of solutions mod d is 2^k. 

Therefore, in general, the number of solutions mod d to s(s-1) ≡0 mod d is 2^{ω(d)}, where ω(d) is the number of distinct prime factors of d. 

But this

---------------

 is when d is square-free. If d is not square-free, say d has a prime power p^e, then perhaps?

Wait, let me think. Suppose d has a square factor, say d = p^2. Then s(s-1) ≡0 mod p^2. This requires that either s ≡0 mod p^2 or s ≡1 mod p^2, because if s ≡0 mod p, then s must be 0 mod p^2 to have p^2 divide s, or s-1 must be 0 mod p^2. Otherwise

---------------

, if s ≡k mod p^2 where k is between 1 and p^2-1 not 0 or 1, then neither s nor s-1 is divisible by p^2, but since they are consecutive, they can't both be divisible by p. So actually

---------------

, for prime powers, the number of solutions mod p^e is 2. 

Therefore, even for prime powers, the number of solutions mod p^e is 2. 

Therefore, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the number of solutions mod d is 2^{ω(d)}, where ω(d) is the number of distinct prime factors of d, even if d is not square-free? Wait, let's see. 

Wait, if d is p^e, then solutions mod d are 2. If d is p^e * q^f, then solutions mod d would be 2*2=4, so indeed 2^{number of distinct primes}. So even if d has multiple exponents, as long as the prime factors are distinct, the number is 2^{ω(d)}. 

Therefore, the total number of solutions s mod d is 2^{ω(d)}. 

Therefore, in the interval from ceil(sqrt(d+1)) to d, how many integers s are congruent to 0 or 1 mod each prime power in d's factorization? Wait, actually, the solutions mod d are those s where s ≡0 or1 mod each prime factor? Wait no, the

---------------

 solutions mod d are those s such that for each prime p dividing d, s ≡0 or1 mod p. 

Wait, actually, for each prime p dividing d, s must be ≡0 or1 mod p. Therefore

---------------

, the solutions mod d are the numbers s congruent to a tuple (a_p) where a_p is 0 or1 mod p for each prime p dividing d. 

By Chinese Remainder Theorem, this gives 2^{ω(d)} solutions mod d. 

Therefore, the total number of solutions in the range [1, d] would be roughly 2^{ω(d)}, but exactly

---------------

, it's floor(d / m) * 2^{ω(d)} ? Not exactly, perhaps exactly 2^{ω(d)} solutions

---------------

 mod d, so in each block of d numbers, there are 2^{ω(d)} solutions. 

Therefore, in the interval from 1 to d, the number of solutions is exactly 2^{ω(d)}. 

However, in our problem, the interval is from ceil(sqrt(d+1)) to d. 

Therefore, the total number of solutions s in that interval would be equal to (number of solutions between 1 and d) minus (number of solutions between 1 and ceil(sqrt(d+1)) -1). 

Hmm, so to

---------------

 compute the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)), d], it's equal to:

Number of solutions mod d in [1,d] minus the number of solutions in [1, ceil(sqrt(d+1)) -1]

But since the total number of solutions mod d in [1,d] is exactly 2^{ω(d)}, because

---------------

 each residue class mod d occurs exactly once in 1 to d. Therefore, the number of solutions in [1, d] is exactly 2^{ω(d)}. 

Therefore, the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)), d] is equal to 2^{ω(d)} minus the number of solutions less than ceil(sqrt(d+1)). 

Hmm, but this might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps for

---------------

 large d, the number of solutions in the interval [sqrt(d), d] is roughly (d - sqrt(d)) / d * 2^{ω(d)} }

---------------

? Not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe we can approximate that the number of solutions is roughly proportional to 2^{ω(d)}. So to get more than ten solutions, we need 2^{ω(d)} to be greater than ten? But that would be 2^4=16, so ω(d) >=4. But perhaps

---------------

 not exactly, because the solutions are spread out. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of d such that 2^{ω(d)} is large enough, but also that the interval [sqrt(d+1), d] is large enough. 

Alternatively, let me try small values of d and see how the count works. 

Wait, but maybe it

---------------

's better to think of the number of s between ceil(sqrt(d+1)) and d where s ≡0 or1 mod p for each prime p dividing d. 

Alternatively, since the number of solutions is 2^{ω(d)}, but they

---------------

 are spread throughout the range. 

Alternatively, maybe the minimal d where 2^{ω(d)} exceeds 10? Since 2^4=16, so ω(d)>=4. The smallest d with ω(d)>=4 is 2*3*5*7=210. But that's probably too big, and maybe the actual number of solutions in the interval is less. 

Alternatively, perhaps my approach is wrong. Let me think again. 

Wait, maybe

---------------

 instead of trying to find an exact formula, I can compute for various values of b (or d = b-1) and count the number of s. 

Given that we need the first b where there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers, perhaps trying

---------------

 b starting from 2 upwards and count until we reach the first b with over ten. 

But that might take a while, but maybe manageable. Let's see. 

Alternatively, let's see if there's a smarter way. Let me think again of the equation:

We have s² = a*b + c, with a + c = s. 

We

---------------

 also have a = (s² - s)/(b -1). 

Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, so (s² - s) must be divisible by (b -1). 

Moreover

---------------

, c = s - a must be between 0 and b-1. 

So for each b, the possible s are those where s(s -1) divisible by (b-1). 

So

---------------

 for each b, the number of s is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (b-1) divides s(s-1). 

Therefore, perhaps the number of such s is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) in some way? 

Alternatively, for

---------------

 each s between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1, check if (b-1) divides s(s-1). 

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 think of s(s-1) ≡0 mod (b-1). 

So for a given b, the number of s in that interval is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] where s ≡0 or 1 mod p for each prime p dividing (b-1). 

Hmm, perhaps I

---------------

 need to look for b where (b-1) has many factors, so that there are many s in the interval that satisfy the congruence. 

Alternatively, since

---------------

 s ranges from about sqrt(b) to b-1, so the length of the interval is roughly b - sqrt(b). 

To have more than 10 solutions, maybe b needs to be large enough so that the interval is large and the modulus (b-1) has many divisors, allowing many s to satisfy s(s-1) divisible by (b-1). 

Alternatively, perhaps choosing

---------------

 (b-1) as a factorial or something with many factors. 

Alternatively, let me consider that (b-1) divides s(s-1). Let me note that s and s-1 are coprime, so (b-1) must divide s or divide s-1, or split into factors dividing each. 

Wait, but since they are coprime, the factors of (b-1) must divide either s or s-1, but not both. 

Therefore, the number of s in the interval is equal to the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that s ≡0 mod d or s≡1 mod d, where d divides (b-1). Wait, not exactly. 

Alternatively, since (b-1) divides s(s-1), then for each divisor d of (b-1), either s ≡0 mod d or s≡1 mod ( (b-1)/d ). Hmm, not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps for

---------------

 each divisor m of (b-1), the number of s ≡0 mod m or s≡1 mod ( (b-1)/m ). Not sure. 

Alternatively, let me think of (b-1) as some number, say,

---------------

 let me pick a specific value for b and compute the number of s. 

Let me try with b=10. Then d=9. 

So,

---------------

 for b=10, d=9. 

We need s in [ceil(sqrt(10)), 9] = [4,9]. 

We need s(s-1) divisible by 9. 

So check s from 4 to9:

s=4: 4*3=12. 12 mod9=3 → no.

s=5:5*4=20 mod9=2 → no.

s=6:6*5=30 mod9=3 → no.

s=7:7*6=42 mod9=6 → no.

s=8:8*7=56 mod9=2 → no.

s=9:9*8=72 mod9=0 → yes. 

Thus only s=9 is valid. 

So there's only one 10-beautiful number. 

Hmm, so b=10 gives 1. 

Trying

---------------

 b=7 (d=6). 

s from ceil(sqrt(7))=3 to 6.

Check s=3: 3*2=6 divisible by 6 → yes. 

s=4:4*3=12 divisible by6 → yes.

s=5:5*4=20 mod6=2 → no.

s=6:6*5=30 divisible by6 → yes. 

Thus s=3,4,6. So three numbers. 

So b=7 gives 3. 

b=6 (d=5):

s from ceil(sqrt(6))=3 to 5.

Check s=3:3*2=6 mod5=1 → no.

s=4:4*3=12 mod5=2 → no.

s=5:5*4=20 mod5=0 → yes.

Only s=5. So 1.

Hmm, okay. 

Trying b=15 (d=14). 

s from ceil(sqrt(15))=4 to14. 

We need s(s-1) divisible by14. 

14 factors into 2 and7. 

Thus s must satisfy s ≡0 or1 mod2 and mod7. 

Wait, s

---------------

(s-1) divisible by2 and by7. 

For divisibility by2: since s and s-1 are consecutive, one is even, so that's always true. 

For divisibility by7: s ≡0 mod7 or s≡1 mod7. 

Thus in the range s=4 to14, the valid s are those congruent to0 or1 mod7. 

Numbers between 4-14:

s=0 mod7: 7,14

s=1 mod7:1,8,15 (but 15 is beyond 14). So 1 is below 4, so 8.

Thus s=7,8,14. 

Check each:

s=7:7*6=42 divisible by14 → yes. 

s=8:8*7=56 divisible by14 → yes. 

s=14:14*13=182 divisible by14 → yes. 

Thus 3 numbers. 

Hmm, still low. 

Trying b=16 (d=15). 

d=15, so s from 4 to15. 

We need s(s-1) divisible by15. 

15 factors into 3 and5. 

Thus s must be ≡0 or1 mod3 and mod5. 

So solving

---------------

 s ≡0 or1 mod3 and s≡0 or1 mod5. 

Total solutions mod15: 2*2=4 solutions. 

Possible residues mod15:

Looking

---------------

 for s ≡0 or1 mod3 and 0 or1 mod5.

Let me list all possibilities:

Case1: s≡0 mod3 and s≡0 mod5 → s≡0 mod15.

Case2: s≡0 mod3 and s≡1 mod5 → solve s=3k, s=5m+1. 3k ≡1 mod5 ⇒ 3k≡1 ⇒ k≡2 mod5. So k=5n+2 ⇒ s=15n +6.

Case3: s≡1 mod3 and s≡0 mod5 → s=5m, s≡1 mod3 ⇒5m≡1 mod3 ⇒ m≡2 mod3 ⇒ m=3k+2 ⇒ s=15k +10.

Case4: s≡1 mod3 and s≡1 mod5 → s≡1 mod15.

Thus residues mod15 are 0,6,10,1 mod15.

Therefore, in the range 4 to15, the s that

---------------

 satisfy are:

Numbers ≡0,1,6,10 mod15 in that interval. 

Numbers from4-15:

Check residues

---------------

:

Numbers:

s=6:6 mod15 → yes (6 mod15 is 6 which is in the cases above (case2:6 mod15))

s=10:10 mod15 → yes (case3)

s=15:15 mod15=0 → yes (case1)

s=1:1 mod15 → but 1 is below 4.

s=

1 mod15 in the interval: s=16 is over, so only s=1, which is too low.

Wait, in

---------------

 4 to15, the numbers that are 0 mod15:15

1 mod15:1, 16 (out of range). So only 15.

Similarly 6 mod15:6, 21 (out of range). So 6.

10 mod15:10, 25 (out). So 10.

Thus s=6,10,15. 

Wait, but s=15 is included as it's up to 15. 

Wait, let

---------------

's check each s from4-15:

s=4:4*3=12 mod15=12 → not divisible by15.

s=5:5*4=20 mod15=5 → no.

s=6:6*5=30 mod15=0 → yes.

s=7:7*6=42 mod15=12 → no.

s=8:8*7=56 mod15=11 → no.

s=9:9*8=72 mod15=72-60=12 → no.

s=10:10*9=90 mod15=0 → yes.

s=11:11*10=110 mod15=110-90=20 mod15=5 → no.

s=12:12*11=132 mod15=132-135= -3 mod15 → 12 → no.

s=13:13*12=156 mod15=156-150=6 → no.

s=14:14*13=182 mod15=182-180=2 → no.

s=15:15*14=210 mod15=0 → yes.

Thus, s=6,10,15. So three numbers again. 

Hmm, still not enough. 

Trying b=21 (d=20). 

d=20, so s from ceil(sqrt(21))=5 to20. 

We need s(s-1) divisible by20. 

20 factors into 2^2 and5. 

Thus, s(s-1) must be divisible by4 and5. 

Divisible by4: since s and s-1 are consecutive, one is even. To have divisible by4, either:

- s even and divisible by4, or 

- s-1 even and divisible by4 (i.e., s ≡1 mod4). 

Additionally

---------------

, divisible by5: s ≡0 or1 mod5. 

Therefore, s must satisfy:

Either s ≡0 mod4 or s≡1 mod4,

AND

s ≡0 or1 mod5.

Thus, combining

---------------

 these conditions. 

Let me consider all combinations:

Possible cases mod20 (since 4 and5 are coprime):

First, mod4 and mod5:

We

---------------

 can use Chinese Remainder Theorem. 

Let me list the possible residues mod4 and mod5:

For mod4: s ≡0 or1 mod4.

For mod5: s ≡0 or1 mod5.

Thus, total 2*2=4 combinations:

1. s≡0 mod4 and s≡0 mod5: solve

---------------

 s≡0 mod lcm(4,5)=20. So s≡0 mod20.

2. s≡0 mod4 and s≡1 mod5: find

---------------

 s ≡0 mod4 and 1 mod5. Let s=4k. Then 4k≡1 mod5 ⇒4k≡1 ⇒k≡4^{-1}*1 mod5. Since 4*4=16≡1 mod5 ⇒ inverse of4 is4. Thus k≡4 mod5 ⇒k=5m+4 ⇒ s=4*(5m+4)=20m +16. So s≡16 mod20.

3. s≡1 mod4 and s≡0 mod5: s≡1 mod4 and 0 mod5. Let s=5k. Then 5k≡1 mod4 ⇒5≡1 mod4 ⇒ so 1*k≡1 mod4 ⇒k≡1 mod4 ⇒k=4m+1 ⇒ s=5*(4m+1)=20m +5 ⇒ s≡5 mod20.

4. s≡1 mod4 and s≡1 mod5: s≡1 mod lcm(4,5)=20. So s≡1 mod20.

Thus the solutions mod20 are residues 0,1,5,16 mod20. 

Thus in the interval 5 to20:

Numbers congruent to 0,1,5,16 mod20.

Check

---------------

 each:

Numbers:

0 mod20: 20.

1 mod20:1 (too low), 21 (too high).

5 mod20:5,25 (too high).

16 mod20:16.

Thus in the range 5 to20:

s=5,16,20.

Check these:

s=5:5*4=20 divisible by20 → yes.

s=16:16*15=240 divisible by20 → yes.

s=20:20*19=380 divisible by20 → yes.

Wait, s=5: s

---------------

=5 is in the range (5 to20). 

Wait, s=5: 5 is the lower bound. 

So s=5,16,20. That's three numbers. Hmm, same as before. 

Hmm, not

---------------

 enough. 

Wait, maybe need a higher base. Let me try b=25 (d=24). 

d=24, so s from ceil(sqrt(25))=5 to24. 

Need s(s-1) divisible by24. 

24 factors into 3*8 (2^3*3). 

Thus, s(s-1) divisible by8 and by3. 

Divisible by8: since s and s-1 are consecutive, one even, one odd. The even one must be divisible by8, or the product must have three factors of2. Since only

---------------

 one even term, so that even term must be divisible by8. 

Thus, either s ≡0 mod8 or s≡1 mod8. 

Divisible by3: s≡0 or1 mod3. 

Thus, combining these:

s must satisfy:

(s ≡0 mod8 or s≡1 mod8) AND (s≡0 or1 mod3).

Thus, possible

---------------

 combinations mod 24 (lcm of8 and3 is24):

Let me consider mod8 and mod3:

mod8 options: 0 or1 mod8.

mod3 options:0 or1 mod3.

Total 2*2=4 combinations.

1

---------------

. s≡0 mod8 and s≡0 mod3: solve s≡0 mod24.

2. s≡0 mod8 and s≡1 mod3: s≡0 mod8 ⇒ s=8k. 8k≡1 mod3 ⇒ 8≡2 mod3 ⇒2k≡1 mod3 ⇒k≡2 mod3 ⇒k=3m+2 ⇒ s=8*(3m+2)=24m+16 ⇒ s≡16 mod24.

3. s≡1 mod8 and s≡0 mod3: s=8k+1. Then 8k+1≡0 mod3 ⇒8k≡-1 mod3 ⇒2k≡-1 ⇒2k≡2 mod3 ⇒k≡1 mod3 ⇒k=3m+1 ⇒ s=8*(3m+1)+1=24m+9 ⇒ s≡9 mod24.

4. s≡1 mod8 and s≡1 mod3: s≡1 mod24.

Thus the solutions mod24 are residues 0,9,16,1 mod24. 

Thus in the interval s from5 to24, the s that satisfy are:

Numbers congruent to 0,1,9,16 mod24.

Within 5 to24:

Check residues:

0 mod24:24.

1 mod24:1 (too low),25 (too high).

9 mod24:9, 33 (too high).

16 mod24:16.

Thus s=9,16,24.

Check:

s=9:9*8=72 divisible by24? 72/24=3 → yes.

s=16:16*15=240 divisible by24 → yes (240/24=10).

s=24:24*23=552 divisible by24? 552/24=23 → yes.

Additionally, check if there are other numbers:

Wait, 24 mod24 is 0, so s=24 is included. 

Wait, but

---------------

 in the interval 5 to24, so s=9,16,24. So three again. 

Hmm, same count. 

Hmm, maybe need to go

---------------

 higher. Let me try b=31 (d=30). 

d=30, so s from ceil(sqrt(31))≈6 to30. 

We need s(s-1) divisible by30. 

30 factors into 2,3,5. 

Thus s(s-1) divisible by2,3,5. 

Since they are coprime, each prime factor must divide either s or s-1. 

Thus for primes 2,3,5:

Either s≡0 mod2 or s≡1 mod2,

s≡0 mod3 or1 mod3,

s≡0 mod5 or1 mod5.

But since s and s-1 are consecutive, they can't both be even, etc., but the divisibility conditions are that each prime divides exactly one of s or s-1. 

Therefore, the conditions are:

For each prime p in {2,3,5}, s ≡0 mod p or s≡1 mod p. 

Therefore, the solutions mod30 (lcm of2,3,5) are all combinations of s≡0 or1 mod2, mod3, mod5. 

Total solutions mod30: 2^3=8 solutions. 

Let me compute them:

Possible residues mod30:

We can build

---------------

 them via Chinese Remainder Theorem. Let me list all 8 possibilities:

1. s≡0 mod2, 0 mod3, 0 mod5 ⇒ s≡0 mod30.

2. s≡0 mod2,0 mod3,1 mod5 ⇒ s≡0 mod6, 1 mod5. Solve s=6k≡1 mod5 ⇒6k≡1 mod5 ⇒k≡1 mod5 ⇒k=5m+1 ⇒s=6*(5m+1)=30m+6 ⇒ s≡6 mod30.

3. s≡0 mod2,1 mod3,0 mod5 ⇒ s≡0 mod2,1 mod3,0 mod5. 

s≡0 mod2 and0 mod5 ⇒ s≡0 mod10. Also s≡1 mod3. Let s=10k. 10k≡1 mod3 ⇒10≡1 mod3 ⇒k≡1 mod3 ⇒k=3m+1 ⇒s=10*(3m+1)=30m+10 ⇒ s≡10 mod30.

4. s≡0 mod2,1 mod3,1 mod5 ⇒ s≡0 mod2,1 mod3,1 mod5.

s≡1 mod3 and1 mod5 ⇒ s≡1 mod15. Also even. So s≡16 mod30 (since 1 mod15 and even: 16 mod30).

5. s≡1 mod2,0 mod3,0 mod5 ⇒ s≡1 mod2,0 mod15 ⇒ s≡15 mod30 (since 15 is odd and divisible by15).

6. s≡1 mod2,0 mod3,1 mod5 ⇒ s≡1 mod2,0 mod3,1 mod5.

s≡0 mod3 and1 mod5 ⇒ s≡6 mod15 (since 6 mod15 is 0 mod3 and 1 mod5? Wait 6 mod5 is1, yes. So s≡6 mod15 and s≡1 mod2. Since 6 mod2 is0, so need s≡6+15m ≡1 mod2 ⇒ 6+15m is odd ⇒15m must be odd ⇒ m odd. So m=2k+1 ⇒ s=6+15(2k+1)=30k +21 ⇒ s≡21 mod30.

7. s≡1 mod2,1 mod3,0 mod5 ⇒ s≡1 mod2,1 mod3,0 mod5 ⇒ s≡10 mod15 and 1 mod2. 10 mod2 is0 ⇒ need 10+15m ≡1 mod2 ⇒ 10+15m is odd ⇒15m is odd ⇒m odd ⇒ m=2k+1 ⇒ s=10+15*(2k+1)=30k +25 ⇒ s≡25 mod30.

8. s≡1 mod2,1 mod3,1 mod5 ⇒ s≡1 mod lcm(2,3,5)=30 ⇒ s≡1 mod30.

Thus the residues mod30 are: 0,6,10,16,15,21,25,1 mod30.

Therefore, in the interval s=6 to30:

Numbers congruent to 0,1,6,10,15,16,21,25 mod30. 

Let me list them in 6 to30:

-

---------------

 0 mod30:30.

-1 mod30:1 (too low),31 (too high).

6 mod30:6.

10 mod30:10.

15 mod30:15.

16 mod30:16.

21 mod30:21.

25 mod30:25.

Thus the valid s values are:6,10,15,16,21,25,30. 

Wait, let's check each:

s=6:6*5=30 divisible by30 → yes.

s=10:10*9=90 divisible by30 → yes.

s=15:15*14=210 divisible by30 → yes.

s=16:16*15=240 divisible by30 → yes.

s=21:21*20=420 divisible by30 → yes.

s=25:25*24=600 divisible by30 → yes.

s=30:30*29=870 divisible by30 → yes.

Additionally, check if 6 is included: yes, since ceil(sqrt(31)) is6. 

So total 7 numbers. 

Hmm, 7, still under 10. 

Hmm, need

---------------

 higher b. 

Let me try b= 49 (d=48). 

d=48. So s from 7 to48. 

Need s(s-1) divisible by48. 

48=16*3=2^4*3.

Thus s(s-1) must be divisible by16 and3. 

Divisible by3: s≡0 or1 mod3. 

Divisible by16: since s and s-1 are consecutive, one even, one odd. The even one must be divisible by16, or the even one divisible by 8 and the other divisible by 2? 

Wait, for

---------------

 divisibility by 16: the even term must be divisible by16, since the other term is odd. Because the product s

---------------

(s-1) has only one even factor, so to have 2^4 divides it, the even term must be divisible by16. 

Thus, s ≡0 mod16 or s≡1 mod16. 

Therefore, combining with mod3:

s must satisfy (s ≡0 mod16 or1 mod16) and (s≡0 or1 mod3). 

Thus mod48 (lcm of16 and3 is48). 

Possible combinations:

mod16:0 or1 mod16

mod3:0 or1 mod3

Total 2*2=4 combinations mod48:

1. s≡0 mod16 and 0 mod3 ⇒ s≡0 mod48.

2. s≡0 mod16 and1 mod3 ⇒ s≡0 mod16, 1 mod3. Let s=16k. 16k≡1 mod3 ⇒16≡1 mod3 ⇒k≡1 mod3 ⇒k=3m+1 ⇒s=16*(3m+1)=48m+16 ⇒ s≡16 mod48.

3. s≡1 mod16 and0 mod3 ⇒ s≡1 mod16, 0 mod3. Let s=16k+1. 16k+1≡0 mod3 ⇒16k≡-1 mod3 ⇒16≡1 ⇒k≡-1 mod3 ⇒k≡2 mod3 ⇒k=3m+2 ⇒ s=16*(3m+2)+1=48m +33 ⇒ s≡33 mod48.

4. s≡1 mod16 and1 mod3 ⇒ s≡1 mod48.

Thus residues mod48:0,16,33,1 mod48.

Thus in the interval s=7 to48:

Numbers congruent to 0,1,16,33 mod48.

Check:

0 mod48:48.

1 mod48:1 (too low), 49 (too high).

16 mod48:16, 64 (too high).

33 mod48:33.

Thus s=16,33,48.

Check each:

s=16:16*15=240 divisible by48? 240/48=5 → yes.

s=33:33*32=1056 divisible by48? 1056/48=22 → yes.

s=48:48*47=2256 divisible by48? 2256/48=47 → yes.

Additionally, check if there's s

---------------

=1 mod48 in the interval? 1 is too low, next is49, too high. 

Thus only three numbers again. 

Hmm, not helpful. 

Wait, perhaps my approach is not working. Maybe I need a different strategy. 

Let me think again of the equation:

a = (s² - s)/(b-1)

Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, so:

1 ≤ (s² - s)/(b-1) ≤ b-1

Therefore,

s² - s ≥ b -1 

and 

s² - s ≤ (b -1)^2 

Wait, let

---------------

 me re-express the inequalities:

First inequality: 

(s² - s) ≥ (b -1) ⇒ s² - s - (b -1) ≥0

Second inequality:

(s² - s) ≤ (b -1)^2 ⇒ s² - s - (b-1)^2 ≤0

So for each s, these inequalities must hold. 

But since b = d +1 where d = b-1, so substituting b = d +1:

First inequality:

s² - s ≥ d 

Second inequality:

s² - s ≤ d² 

So, combining these:

d ≤ s² - s ≤ d² 

Also

---------------

, s must be between ceil(sqrt(d +1)) and d. 

Hmm, perhaps this can help bound s. 

Alternatively, let

---------------

 me consider that for a given d, the possible s must satisfy ceil(sqrt(d+1)) ≤ s ≤d, and s² - s must be divisible by d. 

So the number of solutions is the number of s in that interval where d divides s(s-1). 

To

---------------

 find the minimal d where this count exceeds 10. 

Perhaps the number of solutions is maximized when d has many divisors, so that there are many s such that d divides s(s-1). 

So

---------------

 perhaps d needs to be a highly composite number. 

Let me try d=60 (so b=61). 

d=60, so s from ceil(sqrt(61))=8 to60. 

We need s(s-1) divisible by60. 

60 factors into 2²*3*5. 

Thus, s(s-1) divisible by4,3,5. 

Divisible by4: as

---------------

 before, either s≡0 mod4 or s≡1 mod4. 

Divisible by3: s≡0 or1 mod3. 

Divisible by5: s≡0 or1 mod5. 

Therefore, combining these conditions, the solutions mod60 (lcm of4,3,5=60):

Each prime power:

For mod4:0 or1 mod4.

mod3:0 or1 mod3.

mod5:0 or1 mod5. 

Total solutions mod60: 2^3=8 possibilities. 

Wait, but mod

---------------

4 and mod2 are related. Wait, actually, the mod4 condition is already considering divisibility by4. 

Wait, the

---------------

 total combinations are:

mod4:2 choices (0 or1)

mod3:2 choices (0 or1)

mod5:2 choices (0 or1)

Thus total 2^3=8 solutions mod60. 

Let me compute them:

Using Chinese Remainder Theorem:

Let

---------------

 me go through all 8 combinations:

1. s≡0 mod4, 0 mod3, 0 mod5 ⇒ s≡0 mod60.

2. s≡0 mod4,0 mod3,1 mod5 ⇒ s≡0 mod12,1 mod5. 

Let me solve s=12k≡1 mod5 ⇒12k≡1 mod5 ⇒2k≡1 ⇒k≡3 mod5 ⇒k=5m+3 ⇒s=12*(5m+3)=60m+36 ⇒ s≡36 mod60.

3. s≡0 mod4,1 mod3,0 mod5 ⇒ s≡0 mod20,1 mod3. 

s=20k ≡1 mod3 ⇒20k≡2k≡1 mod3 ⇒k≡2 mod3 ⇒k=3m+2 ⇒s=20*(3m+2)=60m+40 ⇒ s≡40 mod60.

4. s≡0 mod4,1 mod3,1 mod5 ⇒ s≡0 mod4,1 mod3,1 mod5.

s≡1 mod3 and1 mod5 ⇒ s≡1 mod15. Also divisible

---------------

 by4. 

Find s≡1 mod15 and0 mod4. 

Let s=15k+1. 15k+1≡0 mod4 ⇒15k≡-1 mod4 ⇒3k≡-1 ⇒3k≡3 mod4 ⇒k≡1 mod4 ⇒k=4m+1 ⇒s=15*(4m+1)+1=60m+16 ⇒ s≡16 mod60.

5. s≡1 mod4,0 mod3,0 mod5 ⇒ s≡1 mod4,0 mod15. 

s≡0 mod15 and1 mod4. Let s=15k. 15k≡1 mod4 ⇒15≡3 ⇒3k≡1 mod4 ⇒k≡3 mod4 ⇒k=4m+3 ⇒s=15*(4m+3)=60m+45 ⇒ s≡45 mod60.

6. s≡1 mod4,0 mod3,1 mod5 ⇒ s≡1 mod4,0 mod3,1 mod5. 

s≡0 mod3 and1 mod5 ⇒ s≡6 mod15. Also s≡1 mod4. 

s=15k+6. 15k+6≡1 mod4 ⇒15k≡-5 mod4 ⇒3k≡-1 ⇒3k≡3 mod4 ⇒k≡1 mod4 ⇒k=4m+1 ⇒s=15*(4m+1)+6=60m+21 ⇒ s≡21 mod60.

7. s≡1 mod4,1 mod3,0 mod5 ⇒ s≡1 mod4,1 mod3,0 mod5 ⇒ s≡1 mod12 and0 mod5. 

s≡0 mod5 and1 mod12. Let s=5k. 5k≡1 mod12 ⇒5k≡1 ⇒k≡5^{-1}*1 mod12. Since 5*5=25≡1 mod12 ⇒ inverse is5. Thus k≡5 mod12 ⇒k=12m+5 ⇒s=5*(12m+5)=60m+25 ⇒ s≡25 mod60.

8. s≡1 mod4,1 mod3,1 mod5 ⇒ s≡1 mod lcm(4,3,5)=60 ⇒ s≡1 mod60.

Thus residues mod60 are 0,16,21,25,36,40,45,1 mod60. 

Now, in the interval s=8 to60:

Numbers congruent to these residues:

0 mod60:60.

1 mod60:1 (too low),61 (too high).

16 mod60:16,76 (too high).

21 mod60:21,81 (too high).

25 mod60:25,85 (too high).

36 mod60:36.

40 mod60:40.

45 mod60:45.

Thus the valid s are:16,21,25,36,40,45,60. 

Wait, let me list each residue:

- 0 mod60:60.

-1 mod60:1

---------------

 (too low).

-16 mod60:16.

-21 mod60:21.

-25 mod60:25.

-36 mod60:36.

-40 mod60:40.

-45 mod60:45.

So s=16,21,25,36,40,45,60. That's seven numbers. 

Still under 10. 

Hmm, maybe

---------------

 need a higher d. Let me try d= 84 (b=85). 

d=84, so s from ceil(sqrt(85))≈10 to84. 

We need s(s-1) divisible by84. 

84 factors into 2²*3*7. 

Thus divisible by4,3,7. 

Divisible by4: s≡0 or1 mod4.

Divisible by3: s≡0 or1 mod3.

Divisible by7: s≡0 or1 mod7.

Total solutions mod84 (lcm of4,3,7 is84). 

Each

---------------

 of the three conditions has two options, so 2^3=8 solutions mod84. 

Let me compute residues mod84:

Following the same method as before:

1. s≡0 mod4,0 mod3,0 mod7 ⇒ s≡0 mod84.

2. s≡0 mod4,0 mod3,1 mod7 ⇒ s≡0 mod12,1 mod7.

Let s=12k≡1 mod7 ⇒12k≡1 mod7 ⇒5k≡1 ⇒k≡3 mod7 ⇒k=7m+3 ⇒s=12*(7m+3)=84m+36 ⇒ s≡36 mod84.

3. s≡0 mod4,1 mod3,0 mod7 ⇒ s≡0 mod28,1 mod3.

s=28k≡1 mod3 ⇒28≡1 mod3 ⇒k≡1 mod3 ⇒k=3m+1 ⇒s=28*(3m+1)=84m+28 ⇒ s≡28 mod84.

4. s≡0 mod4,1 mod3,1 mod7 ⇒ s≡0 mod4,1 mod3,1 mod7.

s≡1 mod3 and1 mod7 ⇒ s≡1 mod21. Also divisible by4.

Find s≡1 mod21 and0 mod4. Let s=21k+1. 21k+1≡0 mod4 ⇒21k≡-1 mod4 ⇒1k≡-1 ⇒k≡3 mod4 ⇒k=4m+3 ⇒s=21*(4m+3)+1=84m+64 ⇒ s≡64 mod84.

5. s≡1 mod4,0 mod3,0 mod7 ⇒ s≡1 mod4,0 mod21 ⇒ s≡21 mod28 (since 21 mod4 is 1). Wait, solving s≡0 mod21 and1 mod4.

s=21k≡1 mod4 ⇒21≡1 mod4 ⇒k≡1 mod4 ⇒k=4m+1 ⇒s=21*(4m+1)=84m+21 ⇒ s≡21 mod84.

6. s≡1 mod4,0 mod3,1 mod7 ⇒ s≡1 mod4,0 mod3,1 mod7.

s≡0 mod3 and1 mod7 ⇒ s≡6 mod21. Also s≡1 mod4.

s=21k+6 ≡1 mod4 ⇒21k +6 ≡(1k +2) mod4 ⇒k+2≡1 ⇒k≡-1≡3 mod4 ⇒k=4m+3 ⇒s=21*(4m+3)+6=84m+69 ⇒ s≡69 mod84.

7. s≡1 mod4,1 mod3,0 mod7 ⇒ s≡1 mod4,1 mod3,0 mod7 ⇒ s≡1 mod12 and0 mod7.

s=7k≡1 mod12. Let me solve 7k ≡1 mod12 ⇒7^{-1} mod12 is7 since 7*7=49≡1 mod12 ⇒k≡7 mod12 ⇒k=12m+7 ⇒s=7*(12m+7)=84m+49 ⇒ s≡49 mod84.

8. s≡1 mod4,1 mod3,1 mod7 ⇒ s≡1 mod lcm(4,3,7)=84 ⇒ s≡1 mod84.

Thus residues mod84:0,21,28,36,49,64,69,1 mod84.

Now, s ranges from10 to84:

Check residues:

0 mod84:84.

1 mod84:1 (too low),85 (too high).

21 mod84:21.

28 mod84:28.

36 mod84:36.

49 mod84:49.

64 mod84:64.

69 mod84:69.

Thus the valid s are:21,28,36,49,64,69,84. 

Wait

---------------

, that's seven numbers again. 

Hmm. Maybe I need to consider d with more prime factors. 

Wait, maybe d= 120 (b=121). 

d=120 factors into 2^3*3*5. 

So s(s-1) must be divisible by8,3,5. 

Divisible by8: s≡0 mod8 or1 mod8.

Divisible by3:0 or1 mod3.

Divisible by5:0 or1 mod5. 

Thus total solutions mod120 (lcm of8,3,5)=120. 

Number

---------------

 of solutions:2^3=8.

Wait, but mod8 has two options, mod3 two, mod5 two. 

Total 2×2×2=8 solutions mod120. 

Let me compute residues:

This will take time, but let's try some:

1. s≡0 mod8,0 mod3,0 mod5 ⇒0 mod120.

2. s≡0 mod8,0 mod3,1 mod5 ⇒0 mod24,1 mod5 ⇒ solving

---------------

 s=24k≡1 mod5 ⇒24k≡1 mod5 ⇒4k≡1 ⇒k≡4 mod5 ⇒k=5m+4 ⇒s=24*(5m+4)=120m+96 ⇒96 mod120.

3. s≡0 mod8,1 mod3,0 mod5 ⇒0 mod40,1 mod3 ⇒40k≡1 mod3 ⇒1k≡1 ⇒k≡1 mod3 ⇒k=3m+1 ⇒s=40*(3m+1)=120m+40 ⇒40 mod120.

4. s≡0 mod8,1 mod3,1 mod5 ⇒0 mod8,1 mod15 ⇒ solving s≡1 mod15 and0 mod8. Let s=15k+1≡0 mod8 ⇒15k≡-1 mod8 ⇒7k≡7 ⇒k≡1 mod8 ⇒k=8m+1 ⇒s=15*(8m+1)+1=120m+16 ⇒16 mod120.

5. s≡1 mod8,0 mod3,0 mod5 ⇒1 mod8,0 mod15 ⇒ s=15k≡1 mod8 ⇒15≡7 ⇒7k≡1 mod8 ⇒k≡7^{-1}*1 mod8 ⇒7^{-1}=7 ⇒k≡7 mod8 ⇒k=8m+7 ⇒s=15*(8m+7)=120m+105 ⇒105 mod120.

6. s≡1 mod8,0 mod3,1 mod5 ⇒1 mod8,0 mod3,1 mod5 ⇒0 mod3 and1 mod5 ⇒0 mod15 and1 mod8. Let s=15k≡1 mod8 ⇒15k≡1 ⇒7k≡1 ⇒k≡7^{-1}*1 mod8 ⇒7*7=49≡1 ⇒k≡7 mod8 ⇒k=8m+7 ⇒s=15*(8m+7)=120m+105 ⇒105 mod120. Wait, same as previous? Hmm, perhaps miscalculation.

Wait, let me re-express:

s≡0 mod3 and1 mod5 ⇒ s≡6 mod15. Also s≡1 mod8. 

So s=15k+6≡1 mod8 ⇒15k +6 ≡(7k +6) mod8 ⇒7k +6 ≡1 ⇒7k≡-5≡3 mod8 ⇒k≡3*7^{-1} mod8 ⇒7^{-1}=7 ⇒3*7=21≡5 mod8 ⇒ so k≡5 mod8 ⇒k=8m+5 ⇒s=15*(8m+5)+6=120m+81 ⇒81 mod120.

7. s≡1 mod8,1 mod3,0 mod5 ⇒1 mod8,1 mod3,0 mod5 ⇒ s≡1 mod24 and0 mod5. 

s=24k +1≡0 mod5 ⇒24k≡-1 mod5 ⇒4k≡-1 ⇒4k≡4 ⇒k≡1 mod5 ⇒k=5m+1 ⇒s=24*(5m+1)+1=120m+25 ⇒25 mod120.

8. s≡1 mod8,1 mod3,1 mod5 ⇒ s≡1 mod lcm(8,3,5)=120 ⇒1 mod120.

Thus residues mod120 are 0,16,25,40,96,81,105,1 mod120.

Now, s from ceil(sqrt(121))=11 to120.

Check which residues fall in that interval:

0 mod120:120.

1 mod120:1 (too low).

16 mod120:16.

25 mod120:25.

40 mod120:40.

81 mod120:81.

96 mod120:96.

105 mod120:105.

Thus the valid s are:16,25,40,81,96,105,120. 

Total of seven numbers again. 

Hmm, still

---------------

 not enough. 

Wait, perhaps I need a different approach. Let me think of the equation again:

We have s(s-1) divisible by (b-1). To have many solutions s in the interval [sqrt(b), b-1], perhaps (b-1) should be a number that has many factors, so that there are many s in that interval divisible by (

---------------

b-1) or s-1 divisible by (b-1). But since s and s-1 are coprime, (

---------------

b-1) must split into factors that divide s and s-1. 

Alternatively, perhaps (b-1) is a factorial number, which has many factors. Let me try b= 40321 (d=40320), but that's too big. 

Alternatively, maybe the

---------------

 minimal b is 242? Not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps consider that the number of solutions is approximately the number of divisors of (b-1). 

Alternatively, perhaps consider

---------------

 that for (b-1) being a factorial number like 6! =720. 

Wait, let me try b=721 (d=720). 

d=720. 

s from ceil(sqrt(721))≈27 to720.

We need s(s-1) divisible by720. 

720 factors into 2^4*3^2*5. 

Thus, divisible by16,9,5. 

Divisible by16: s≡0 mod16 or1 mod16.

Divisible by9: s≡0 mod9 or1 mod9.

Divisible by5: s≡0 mod5 or1 mod5.

Thus, solutions mod720 (lcm of16,9,5)=720.

Total solutions mod720: 2×2×2=8.

---------------

 

Hmm, same as before, but with more residues. 

But even so, the number of solutions in the large interval would be 720/720 *8=8, but spread over a large interval, so maybe more.

---------------

 

Wait, but in reality, the number of solutions in [sqrt(d)+1, d] would be roughly d/(lcm of mod) * number of solutions mod, but since

---------------

 mod is d itself, it's 1 full period. So the number of solutions is exactly the number of solutions mod d, which is 8. 

Hmm, this isn't scaling up. 

Perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the number of solutions isn't dependent

---------------

 on the number of factors but something else. 

Wait, let's think of the equation s(s-1) divisible by (b-1). 

Let me consider

---------------

 that (b-1) divides s(s-1). Since s and s-1 are coprime, then (b-1) must be a product of two coprime divisors, one dividing s and the other dividing s-1. 

Therefore, the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to factor (b-1) into two coprime factors, and

---------------

 for each factor pair (d, e) where d*e=(b-1), d divides s and e divides s-1 or vice versa. 

Each

---------------

 such factorization gives two solutions (except when d=e=1, but since they are coprime, d and e must be 1 and (b-1)). 

The number of coprime pairs (d,e) with d*e=(b-1) is 2^{k}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of (b-1). 

Therefore

---------------

, the number of solutions mod (b-1) is 2^{k}. 

Hence, the total number of s in the interval [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] is approximately 2^{k} *

---------------

 (b-1)/b ≈ 2^{k}. 

To have more than 10 solutions, we need 2^{k} >10 ⇒k≥4. 

Thus, the minimal b-1 must have at least four distinct prime factors. 

The smallest number with four distinct prime factors is 2×3×5×7=210. 

Therefore, if b-1=210, then b=211. 

Let me check this case. 

Take b=211 (d=210). 

d=210 has prime factors 2,3,5,7. 

Thus, the number of solutions mod210 is 2^4=16. 

Thus, in the interval s from ceil(sqrt(211))≈15 to210, there are 16 solutions. 

Therefore

---------------

, the number of b-eautiful numbers is 16, which is more than 10. 

Is there a smaller b? 

The next smaller numbers with four distinct prime factors are: 

The next after 210 is 2×3×5×11=330 (b=331), which is larger. 

Alternatively, numbers

---------------

 like 2×3×5×7=210, 2×3×5×11=330, 2×3×7×5= same as 210, so the next is 330. 

Therefore, the minimal d is 210, so minimal b is211. 

Wait, but maybe

---------------

 there is a number with four prime factors but smaller than210? 

Wait, 2×3×5×7=210 is the smallest with four distinct primes. 

Therefore

---------------

, the minimal b is211. 

But let me verify this with an example. 

Take d=210 (b=211). 

The number of solutions mod210 is 2^4=16. 

So there are 16 solutions between 1 and210. 

The interval we need is from ceil(sqrt(211))=15 to210. 

Thus the number of solutions is 16 minus those below15. 

How many solutions are below15? 

The residues mod210 must be checked. 

The solutions mod210 are all combinations of s≡0 or1 mod2,3,5,7. 

Each

---------------

 prime factor gives a choice of s≡0 or1 mod p. 

Therefore, there are 16 residues mod210. 

The numbers below15 would be s=1,2,...,14. 

Check which of these satisfy s(s-1) divisible by210. 

Since

---------------

 210=2×3×5×7. 

For s between1-14, s(s-1) must be divisible by2,3,5,7. 

But since s and s-1 are small, it's unlikely except for s=1 and s=0 (but s starts at1). 

Check s=1:1×0=0 divisible by210? Well, technically yes, but s must be at least ceil(sqrt(b))=15. So s=1 is too low. 

Similarly

---------------

 s=0 is not considered. 

Thus, all 16 solutions are in the interval from1 to210, but excluding those below15. 

Thus

---------------

, the number of s from15 to210 is16 minus the solutions below15. 

But since s=1 is the only possible solution below15, which is excluded, so the count is16-1=15. 

Wait, but maybe there are more solutions below15. 

Let me check each s from1 to14:

For s=1:1×0=0 divisible by210 → yes, but s=1 is below15. 

s=2:2×1=2 not divisible by210.

s=3:3×2=6 not divisible by210.

s=4:4×3=12 not divisible by210.

s=5:5×4=20 not divisible by210.

s=6:6×5=30 not divisible by210.

s=7:7×6=42 not divisible by210.

s=8:8×7=56 not divisible by210.

s=9:9×8=72 not divisible by210.

s=10:10×9=90 not divisible by210.

s=11:11×10=110 not divisible by210.

s=12:12×11=132 not divisible by210.

s=13:13×12=156 not divisible by210.

s=14:14×13=182 not divisible by210.

Thus, only s=1 is a solution below15. 

Therefore, in the interval15 to210, there are16 -1=15 solutions. 

Hmm, which is still under10? No, 15 is more than10. 

Wait, so b

---------------

=211 gives15 b-eautiful numbers. 

Is there a smaller b with four prime factors? 

Wait, maybe

---------------

 a number with three prime factors but with exponents allowing more solutions? 

Wait, let me check b= 105+1=106 (d=105). 

d=105 has prime factors3,5,7. 

Thus solutions mod105 would be 2^3=8. 

Thus, in the interval ceil(sqrt(106))≈11 to105:

Total solutions mod105:8. 

Subtract those below11:

Check s=1,…,10:

s=1: yes, but too low.

s= others: none

---------------

 divisible by105. 

Thus, 8-1=7 <10. 

Not enough. 

What

---------------

 about b= 120+1=121 (d=120). 

Wait, d=120 has prime factors2,3,5. 

Thus solutions mod120 are 2^3=8. 

Which

---------------

 we already saw gives7 solutions in the interval. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, perhaps b= 84+1=85 (d=84) which had7 solutions. 

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 the minimal is indeed211. 

Wait, but let's check b= 105+1=106 (d=105). 

Wait, 

---------------

105 has 3 distinct primes, so 8 solutions mod105. 

Thus, in the interval from

---------------

11 to105, 8 solutions minus those below11. 

Only s=1 is a solution below11. 

Thus 7, still under10. 

Thus

---------------

, the next candidate is211. 

Wait, but let me check d= 120. 

Wait, d=120 has four prime factors? No, factors are2,3,5. 

So three primes. 

Thus, the first d with four distinct primes is210. 

Thus, b=211 is the minimal. 

Therefore, the answer is211. 

Wait, but the problem says "the least integer b ≥ 2 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers". 

Wait, but according to my calculation for b=211, there are15 solutions. 

Is there a smaller b with four prime factors? 

Wait, 

---------------

2×3×5×7=210. 

The next smaller number with four prime factors would require primes smaller than2,3,5,7, but those are the first four primes. So 2×3×5×7=210 is the smallest composite number with four distinct prime factors. 

Therefore, the minimal b is211. 

Hence, the answer is \boxed{211}

Wait, but let me check with b= 210+1=211. 

Wait, let me confirm with d=210. 

The number of solutions mod210 is 16. 

In the interval from15 to210, there are16 solutions minus those below15. 

Only s=1 is a solution below15, so 16-1=15 solutions. 

15>10, so yes. 

Is there a smaller d with more solutions? 

Wait, what

---------------

 about d= 120, which had 8 solutions. 

Wait, but if d= 180 (b=181). 

d=180 factors into 2²×3²×5. 

Prime factors are2,3,5 (three distinct primes). 

Thus, solutions mod180 would be 2^3=8. 

Thus, in the interval from ceil(sqrt(181))=14 to180. 

Total solutions mod180:8. 

Subtract solutions below14: s=1 only. 

Thus, 7 again. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, d= 210 is the first with four distinct primes. 

Therefore, I think the minimal b is211. 

But the problem might have a smaller answer. Maybe my assumption

---------------

 is wrong. 

Wait, let me check d= 60 (b=61). 

Earlier, d=60 had8 solutions mod60, giving7 solutions in the interval. 

Wait, but 

---------------

60 has prime factors2,3,5 (three primes). 

Thus, solutions mod60:2^3=8. 

Which

---------------

 gave7 in the interval. 

Hmm, but 2^4=16 is needed for four primes. 

Alternatively, maybe my

---------------

 initial assumption is incorrect. 

Wait, perhaps the count isn't exactly 2^{number of prime factors}. 

Wait, when we have four

---------------

 primes, the number of solutions mod d is 2^4=16. 

But in the case of d=210, that

---------------

's correct. 

Thus, the first time the count exceeds10 is at d=210 (b=211), with15 solutions. 

Thus, I think the answer is211. 

But I need

---------------

 to confirm with an example. 

Alternatively, perhaps there is a smaller number with multiple exponents allowing more solutions. 

Wait, take d= 240 (b=241). 

Prime factors2^4*3*5. 

Thus distinct primes are2,3,5. 

Thus solutions mod240:2^3=8. 

Thus, in

---------------

 the interval sqrt(241)=~16 to240: 

Total solutions mod240:8. 

Subtract solutions below16: s=1. 

Thus,7 again. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, d= 360 (b=361). 

Prime factors2^3*3^2*5. 

Distinct primes:2,3,5. 

Thus solutions mod360:8. 

Same as before. 

Hmm, so seems

---------------

 like the minimal is indeed211. 

Thus, I think the answer is211.


To determine the least integer \( b \geq 2 \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful integers, we analyze the conditions for a number \( n \) to be \( b \)-eautiful. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-eautiful if it has exactly two digits in base \( b \), and the sum of these digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \). 

Expressing \( n \) in base \( b \) as \( n = a \cdot b + c \), where \( a \) and \( c \) are digits (with \( 1 \leq a \leq b-1 \) and \( 0 \leq c \leq b-1 \)), we need \( a + c = \sqrt{n} \). Substituting \( n = (a + c)^2 \), we derive the equation:
\[
(a + c)^2 = a \cdot b + c
\]
Rearranging and simplifying, we find:
\[
a = \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \quad \text{where} \quad s = a + c = \sqrt{n}
\]
For \( a \) to be an integer, \( b - 1 \) must divide \( s(s - 1) \). The number of valid \( s \) values (and thus \( b \)-eautiful numbers) depends on the number of divisors of \( b - 1 \).

To have more than ten \( b \)-eautiful numbers, \( b - 1 \) must have enough divisors to allow at least 11 solutions for \( s \). The smallest \( b - 1 \) with four distinct prime factors (ensuring \( 2^4 = 16 \) solutions modulo \( b - 1 \)) is \( 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 = 210 \). Thus, \( b = 210 + 1 = 211 \).

Verification shows \( b = 211 \) yields 15 solutions (more than ten), confirming it as the minimal \( b \).
