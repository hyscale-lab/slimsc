Okay, so I need to find the greatest four-digit number N such that if any single digit is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, once I find N, I have to compute Q + R where N divided by 1000 gives quotient Q and remainder R. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, let's understand the problem. The number N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. The key property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number must be divisible by 7. So, for each digit in N (thousands, hundreds, tens, units), replacing it with 1 should make the number divisible by 7. Our goal is to find the largest such N and then compute Q + R when N is divided by 1000.

Let me denote the four digits of N as a, b, c, d, so N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. Then, changing each digit to 1 gives four different numbers:

1. Change a to 1: 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d
2. Change b to 1: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d
3. Change c to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d
4. Change d to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1

Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7. So, each of these four modified numbers ≡ 0 mod 7.

Therefore, we can set up four congruence equations:

1. 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Our unknowns are a, b, c, d (each digits from 0-9, with a ≠ 0). We need to find the maximum N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d satisfying these four conditions.

Hmm, this seems a bit involved. Maybe I can express each of these congruences in terms of the original number N and see if I can find relationships between them?

Let me denote N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

Then, changing the first digit (a) to 1 gives:

1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = N - 1000(a - 1)

Similarly, changing the second digit (b) to 1 gives:

1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = N - 100(b - 1)

Third digit (c):

1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = N - 10(c - 1)

Fourth digit (d):

1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 = N - (d - 1)

Therefore, each of these expressions must be divisible by 7. So, for each of these modified numbers, their

---------------

 difference from N must be congruent to -N mod 7. Wait, maybe I can rephrase each condition as:

(N - 1000(a - 1)) ≡ 0 mod7

But N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, so substituting:

1000a + 100b + 10c + d - 1000a + 1000 ≡ 0 mod7

Simplify: 100b + 10c + d + 1000 ≡ 0 mod7

Similarly for the other conditions:

Changing b to 1:

(N - 100(b - 1)) ≡0 mod7

Substitute N:

1000a + 100b + 10c + d - 100b + 100 ≡0 mod7

Simplify: 1000a + 10c + d + 100 ≡0 mod7

Changing c to 1:

(N -10(c -1)) ≡0 mod7

1000a + 100b +10c +d -10c +10 ≡0 mod7

Simplify: 1000a +100b +d +10 ≡0 mod7

Changing d to 1:

(N - (d -1)) ≡0 mod7

1000a +100b +10c +d -d +1 ≡0 mod7

Simplify: 1000a +100b +10c +1 ≡0 mod7

Hmm, okay so the four congruence equations are:

1. 100b + 10c + d + 1000 ≡0 mod7 --> Let's call this Equation (1)

2. 1000a +10c + d + 100 ≡0 mod7 --> Equation (2)

3. 1000a +100b +d +10 ≡0 mod7 --> Equation (3)

4. 1000a +100b +10c +1 ≡0 mod7 --> Equation (4)

Now, perhaps I can express each equation modulo 7, since we're dealing with mod7.

First, let me compute the values of 1000 mod7, 100 mod7, 10 mod7, etc. That

---------------

 might help.

Calculating modulus 7 for these coefficients:

Compute 10 mod7 = 3

100 mod7: 100 divided by 7 is 14*7=98, so 100 -98=2. So 100 ≡2 mod7.

Similarly, 1000 mod7: 1000 divided by 7: 7*142=994, so 1000-994=6. So 1000≡6 mod7.

Therefore:

1000 mod7=6,

100 mod7=2,

10 mod7=3,

1 mod7=1.

So substituting these into the equations:

Equation (1):

100b + 10c + d + 1000 ≡ (2b + 3c + d) + 6 ≡0 mod7

Wait, let me redo

---------------

 each equation step by step.

Equation (1): 100b + 10c + d + 1000 mod7.

Each term:

100b mod7 = 2b,

10c mod7 = 3c,

d mod7 = d,

1000 mod7 =6,

Therefore total mod7: 2b + 3c + d +6 ≡0 mod7. Equation (1): 2b +3c +d ≡ -6 mod7. Since mod7, -6 is equivalent to 1 mod7. So Equation (1): 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

Equation (2): 1000a +10c + d + 100 mod7.

Breaking down:

1000a mod7 =6a,

10c mod7=3c,

d mod7=d,

100 mod7=2,

Thus total: 6a +3c +d +2 ≡0 mod7.

Hence Equation (2):6a +3c +d ≡-2 mod7. But -2 mod7 is 5, so 6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7.

Equation (3):1000a +100b +d +10 mod7.

Breaking down:

1000a mod7=6a,

100b mod7=2b,

d mod7=d,

10 mod7=3,

Thus total:6a +2b +d +3 ≡0 mod7.

So Equation (3):6a +2b +d ≡-3 mod7. -3 mod7 is 4, so 6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7.

Equation (4):1000a +100b +10c +1 mod7.

Breaking down:

1000a mod7=6a,

100b mod7=2b,

10c mod7=3c,

1 mod7=1,

Thus total:6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

So Equation (4):6a +2b +3c ≡-1 mod7. -1 mod7 is 6, so 6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

So now we have four equations:

1. 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7. (Equation 1)

2. 6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7. (Equation 2)

3. 6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7. (Equation 3)

4. 6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7. (Equation 4)

Hmm, okay. Now we have four equations with variables a,b,c,d. Since a,b,c,d are digits (a from 1-9, others 0-9), we need to find their

---------------

 values that satisfy these equations. Our goal is the largest N, so we need to maximize N = 1000a + 100b +10c +d, so we should start with the highest possible a, then b, etc., and check if the equations are satisfied.

Alternatively, maybe we can solve the system of equations step by step. Let me see.

First, let's see if we can express variables in terms of others.

Let me note the equations again:

Equation1: 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7. (1)

Equation2:6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7. (2)

Equation3:6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7. (3)

Equation4:6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7. (4)

Hmm, perhaps subtract equations to eliminate variables.

First, let's see Equations 2 and 3. Let's subtract equation 3 from equation 2:

(6a +3c +d) - (6a +2b +d) ≡ (5 -4) mod7

So: (3c -2b) ≡1 mod7 --> 3c -2b ≡1 mod7. Let's call this Equation 5.

Similarly, let's subtract Equation1 from Equation4:

Equation4 - Equation1:

(6a +2b +3c) - (2b +3c +d) ≡6 -1 mod7

So:6a -d ≡5 mod7 --> 6a -d ≡5 mod7. Let's call this Equation6.

Also

---------------

, Equation2 and Equation3 can be considered. Maybe we can find relations between variables.

Alternatively, let's see Equation1 and Equation2. Let me see if we can express d from Equation1 and plug into Equation2.

From Equation1: d ≡1 -2b -3c mod7.

Plugging into Equation2:

6a +3c + (1 -2b -3c) ≡5 mod7

Simplify:6a -2b +1 ≡5 mod7 -->6a -2b ≡4 mod7 --> divide both sides by 2: 3a -b ≡2 mod7. Let's call this Equation7.

Similarly, from Equation3: let's express d from Equation3.

Equation3: d ≡4 -6a -2b mod7.

Plugging into Equation1:

2b +3c + (4 -6a -2b) ≡1 mod7

Simplify: 3c +4 -6a ≡1 mod7 --> -6a +3c ≡-3 mod7 --> 6a -3c ≡3 mod7 --> divide by 3: 2a -c ≡1 mod7. Let's call this Equation8.

So now we have:

Equation5: 3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

Equation6:6a -d ≡5 mod7.

Equation7:3a -b ≡2 mod7.

Equation8:2a -c ≡1 mod7.

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 we can use Equations 7 and 8 to express b and c in terms of a.

From Equation7: 3a -b ≡2 mod7 --> b ≡3a -2 mod7.

From Equation8:2a -c ≡1 mod7 --> c ≡2a -1 mod7.

So, let

---------------

's write b and c in terms of a modulo7.

Let me denote:

Let’s denote variables:

Let’s let’s set

---------------

 b = 3a -2 +7k, for some integer k,

and c =2a -1 +7m, for some integer m.

But since b and c are digits (0-9), their values are constrained. So we

---------------

 need to find a (from 1-9) such that when we compute b and c as above, they are within 0-9. Also, a

---------------

 is a digit from 1-9.

Similarly, once we have b and c in terms of a, we can plug into Equation5 to get a relation between

---------------

 a and the constants?

Alternatively, let's see:

From Equation5: 3c -2b ≡1 mod7. Substitute expressions for b and c from Equations7 and8.

Since

---------------

 c =2a -1 +7m,

and b =3a -2 +7k,

then plug into 3c -2b:

3*(2a -1 +7m) -2*(3a -2 +7k) = 6a -3 +21m -6a +4 -14k = (6a -6a) + (-3 +4) + (21m -14k) = 1 +7*(3m -2k).

Thus 3c -2b ≡1 mod7, which matches Equation5. So that checks out. So Equ

---------------

ations5 is automatically satisfied given Equations7 and8. Therefore, Equations5 is redundant once Equations7 and8 are satisfied.

Similarly, perhaps Equations6 and others can be connected.

So, moving

---------------

 forward, let's express variables in terms of a:

Given Equation7: b =3a -2 mod7,

Equation8: c=2a -1 mod7,

and

---------------

 from Equation6: d ≡6a -5 mod7.

Wait, Equation6:6a -d ≡5 mod7 --> d ≡6a -5 mod7.

So d is congruent to (6a -5) mod7.

So all variables b, c, d can be expressed in terms of a modulo7. However, since a, b, c, d are digits, their actual values are constrained between 0-9 (with a ≥1). So we need to find a value of a (from 1-9) such that when we compute b, c, d based on these congruences, they are valid digits (0-9 for b,c,d; 1-9 for a). Also, we need to ensure that the equations hold exactly mod7, not just congruence.

Wait, actually, the equations are modulo7, so the expressions for b, c, d are congruent to those values mod7. But their actual values must satisfy the original equations. Therefore, perhaps

---------------

 we need to consider the equations as equalities in integers, but with the mod7 constraints. Hmm, this might be a bit tricky. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps we

---------------

 can proceed step by step.

First, let's note that a is a digit from 1 to 9, so let's iterate a from 9 downwards (since we want the largest N, so starting with a=9, then 8 etc.) and see if possible.

For each a from 9 down to 1:

1. Compute possible b and c from

---------------

 Equations7 and8 mod7.

But since b and c have to be digits (0-9), we can find possible values of b and c that

---------------

 satisfy:

b ≡3a -2 mod7,

c ≡2a -1 mod7,

and then also,

---------------

 with these b and c, compute d from Equation1 or Equation2, etc., ensuring that d is a digit (0-9) and that the equations hold.

Alternatively, let's formal

---------------

ize this:

Given a, we can compute b mod7 as (3a -2) mod7,

and c mod7 as (2a -1) mod7,

then d mod7 is (6a -5) mod7.

But since b, c, d are digits, their actual values can be written as:

b = 3a -2 +7k,

c =2a -1 +7m,

d=6a -5 +7n,

where k, m, n are integers such that b, c, d are in their respective ranges (0-9 for b,c,d, and a from1-9).

Our

---------------

 task is to find a (starting from 9 down), and find integers k, m, n such that b, c, d are digits, and then check whether the original equations are satisfied (since the congruences are necessary but not sufficient? Wait, actually, the equations were derived from the original problem's conditions, so if the congruences are satisfied, then the original conditions should hold? Maybe not exactly, since we have to ensure that when we set

---------------

 the digits, the numbers are actually divisible by7, but since we are working mod7, perhaps as long as the congruences are satisfied, the divisibility holds. Hmm, maybe.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the equations we derived are necessary and sufficient, so if the congruences are satisfied, then the original conditions hold. Let me confirm:

We

---------------

 started with the original conditions (each modified number divisible by7), then derived the four equations mod7. Therefore, if the four equations hold mod7, then the original conditions are satisfied. Because the equations were derived from those conditions. So, as long as the four equations are satisfied, the problem's conditions are met. Therefore, as long as we can find digits a,b,c,d (with a from1-9) that satisfy all four equations mod7, then that number N will satisfy the problem's requirement. Therefore, we

---------------

 just need to find such a number, the largest possible.

Therefore, proceeding with this approach.

So, let's try a from 9 down to 1, and for each a, compute possible b, c, d as

---------------

 per the congruences, then check if they can be digits (0-9), and then verify if the equations are satisfied (though maybe

---------------

 the congruences are sufficient).

Wait, but actually, when we set up the equations mod7, they are necessary and sufficient, so if we can find a, b, c, d with

---------------

 the congruences, then it works. So maybe even if we just find the values mod7, but then adjust with the 

---------------

7k, 7m, 7n terms to get actual digits, then it should work.

But let's see.

Let me start with a=9.

Case a=9:

Compute b ≡3a -2 mod7. 3*9=27, 27-2=25. 25 mod7: 25-3*7=25-21=4, so b ≡4 mod7.

Similarly c ≡2a -1 mod7: 2*9 -1=17, 17 mod7: 17-2*7=3, so c≡3 mod7.

d≡6a -5 mod7: 6*9=54, 54-5=49. 49 mod7=0. So d≡0 mod7.

So:

b ≡4 mod7,

c≡3 mod7,

d≡0 mod7.

Now, since a=9, which is fixed, we need to find b, c, d digits (0-9) such that:

b ≡4 mod7: possible b=4,11 (but 11 is too big, so only b=4 or 4+7=11 invalid. So only b=4.

Wait, but 4 mod7 is

---------------

 4, so possible b=4, 11, 18... but since b is a digit (0-9), only possible b=4.

Similarly, c≡3 mod7: c can be 3 or 10 (but 10 is invalid), so c=3.

d≡0 mod7: possible d=0,7.

So, possible candidates for a=9:

b=4, c=3, d=0 or 7.

Now, we need to check if these satisfy the original equations.

Wait, actually, since we derived the congruences from the original equations, as

---------------

 long as these congruences are satisfied, then the equations mod7 hold, which is necessary. However, the actual equations may

---------------

 require more precise conditions. Wait, but since the equations were set up as mod7, the congruences are exactly what's needed. Therefore, if the congruences are satisfied, the original four modified numbers are divisible by7. Therefore, the

---------------

 candidates with these b,c,d should work.

Therefore, for a=9, possible N are:

First candidate: b=4, c=3, d=0: N=9430.

Second candidate: b=4, c=3, d=7: N=9437.

But we need to check if these actually satisfy the original conditions. Let me verify with N=9430.

Check the four cases:

1. Change a to1: 1430. Is 1430 divisible by7?

1430 ÷7: 7*200=1400, 1430-1400=30. 30 ÷7 is ~4.28. Not divisible. Wait, that's a problem. Hmm, but according to our congruence setup, this should be divisible. So something went wrong here.

Wait, so maybe my assumption that congruence satisfaction is sufficient is incorrect? Let me see where the mistake is.

Wait, let me recalculate.

---------------

 Let me check N=9430.

First, changing a to 1 gives 1430.

1430 divided by7: 7*204=1428, 1430-1428=2. So remainder 2, not divisible by7. Hmm, that's a problem.

Hmm, so my reasoning must have an error. Let me check my equations again.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in setting up the equations. Let me retrace the steps.

Original equations:

Equation1: 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7. For N=9430, which has b=4, c=3, d=0.

Plugging in: 2*4 + 3*3 +0 =8+9=17. 17 mod7 is 3. Which is supposed to be ≡1 mod7? 17 mod7=3. So that's not 1 mod7. Wait, so this contradicts. That means my calculation was wrong?



---------------

Wait, but earlier when a=9, we had b≡4 mod7, c≡3 mod7, d≡0 mod7. But when

---------------

 we plug into Equation1, it's not satisfying. Hmm, so maybe my equations were set up incorrectly?

Wait, let me recast the problem again.

Wait, let

---------------

 me re-express the equations. Let me go back to the first equations.

Original four equations after substitutions were:

Equation1: 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

With a=9, b=4, c=3, d=0:

2*4 +3*3 +0 = 8 +9 +0 =17 mod7 is 3. 3≡1 mod7? No. So that's a problem. Therefore, my mistake must have been in the setup of equations.

Hmm, let

---------------

 me check my initial equations again.

The first equation was from changing the first digit (a) to 1:

The modified number is 1000*1 + 100b +10c +d. The original number N is 1000a + 100b +10c +d. Therefore, the difference is 1000*(1 -a) + (0

---------------

) + (0) +0 = 1000(1 -a). Therefore, the modified number is N -1000(a -1). Therefore, N -1000(a -1) ≡0 mod7.

Thus, N ≡1000(a -1) mod7.

But N =1000a +100b +10c +d. So,

1000a +100b +10c +d ≡1000(a -1) mod7,

which

---------------

 simplifies to:

100b +10c +d +1000 ≡0 mod7,

since 1000a -1000(a -1) =1000.

Wait, yes, so 100b +10c +d +1000 ≡0 mod7,

so 100b mod7 is 2b,

10c mod7 is 3c,

d mod7 is d,

1000 mod7 is 6,

so total: 2b +3c +d +6 ≡0 mod7,

so 2b +3c +d ≡ -6 mod7. But -6 mod7 is 1. So that's correct. So equation1 is correct.

But in the case of a=9, b=4, c=3, d=0,

2b +3c +d = 8 +9 +0 =17 ≡3 mod7. But equation requires 1 mod7. So discrepancy here. So that

---------------

 means even though we followed the congruence for b,c,d, they don't satisfy the equation. Therefore, my mistake must be in how I derived the expressions for b,c,d in terms of a.

Wait, let's see:

Earlier, I had:

From Equation7: b ≡3a -2 mod7,

Equation8: c ≡2a -1 mod7,

Equation6: d ≡6a -5 mod7.

Wait, but

---------------

 these were derived from Equations 1,2,3,4. Let me check the derivation again.

Equation7 was from Equation2 - Equation3:



---------------

Wait, let me rederive Equation7 and Equation8 again.

Equation2:6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7,

Equation3:6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7,

Subtracting Equation3 from Equation2:

(6a +3c +d) - (6a +2b +d) ≡5 -4 mod7,

So 3c -2b ≡1 mod7 --> Equation5.

Then, from Equation1 and Equation2:

Equation1:2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7,

Equation2:6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7,

Subtract Equation1 from Equation2:

(6a +3c +d) - (2b +3c +d) ≡5 -1 mod7,

6a -2b ≡4 mod7,

Divide by 2: 3a -b ≡2 mod7 --> Equation7: b ≡3a -2 mod7. That is correct.

Similarly, from Equation1 and Equation3:

Equation1:2b +3c +d ≡1,

Equation3:6a +2b +d ≡4,

Subtract Equation1 from Equation3:

(6a +2b +d) - (2b +3c +d) ≡4 -1 mod7,

6a -3c ≡3 mod7,

Divide by 3: 2a -c ≡1 mod7 --> Equation8: c ≡2a -1 mod7. Correct.

Equation6 was from Equation4 - Equation1:

Equation4:6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7,

Equation1:2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7,

Subtract Equation1 from Equation4:

(6a +2b +3c) - (2b +3c +d) ≡6 -1 mod7,

6a -d ≡5 mod7 --> Equation6: d ≡6a -5 mod7. Correct.

Therefore, these equations are correct.

So for a=9,

Equation7: b ≡3*9 -2 mod7,



---------------

27-2=25, 25 mod7= 25-3*7=25-21=4 mod7. So b≡4 mod7. So b can be 4 or 11, but since b is a digit, 4.

Equation8: c≡2*9 -1 mod7,

18-1=17 mod7=17-14=3 mod7. So c≡3 mod7. So c=3 or 10 (invalid), so 3.

Equation6: d≡6*9 -5 mod7,

54-5=49 mod7=0 mod7. So d≡0 mod7. So d=0 or7.

Therefore, the values are b=4, c=3, d=0 or7. But when plugging into equation1, we

---------------

 saw that for d=0, equation1 gives 2b+3c +d =17 ≡3 mod7, which is not 1 mod7. So that

---------------

 contradicts. Therefore, my mistake must be in assuming that the equations are sufficient?

Wait, but equation1 requires 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7. However

---------------

, with the values from the equations, we have:

From equation1's perspective, if b=4, c=3, d=0:

2b+3c +d= 8+9+0=17≡3 mod7, which is not 1 mod7. So that

---------------

 doesn't satisfy equation1. Therefore, my mistake must be in the process.

Wait, perhaps I missed that the equations are connected

---------------

, so even if each congruence is satisfied individually, they must be satisfied together. So perhaps when I set b≡3a-2 mod7 and c≡2a-1 mod7 and d≡6a-5 mod7, these must

---------------

 all hold simultaneously, but perhaps they also have to satisfy Equation1?

Wait, Equation1 is part of the original set, so if

---------------

 equations 2,3,4 are used to derive equations7,8,6, then perhaps equation1 is redundant or must be satisfied through the combination?

Wait, let me see:

If we have equations 7,8,6, do they ensure equation1?

Let me see:

From equation7: b=3a-2 +7k,

equation8: c=2a-1 +7m,

equation6: d=6a-5 +7n,

then plug into equation1: 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7?

Let me compute 2b +3c +d:

2*(3a -2 +7k) +3*(2a -1 +7m) + (6a -5 +7n)

=6a -4 +14k +6a -3 +21m +6a -5 +7n

Combine like terms:

(6a +6a +6a) + (-4 -3 -5) + (14k +21m +7n)

=18a -12 +7*(2k +3m +n)

Therefore mod7:

18a mod7: 18 mod7=4, so 4a mod7,

-12 mod7: -12 +14=2 mod7,

Thus total:4a +2 mod7.

We

---------------

 need this ≡1 mod7:

4a +2 ≡1 mod7 --> 4a ≡-1 mod7 --> 4a≡6 mod7 --> Multiply both sides by inverse of 4 mod7. Since 4*2=8≡1 mod7, inverse is 2.

Thus, a≡6*2=12≡5 mod7.

Therefore, equation1 is satisfied only if a≡5 mod7.

Therefore, even with equations7,8,6, equation1 requires a ≡5 mod7.

Ah! So that

---------------

 is the missing piece. Therefore, in addition to the congruences for b,c,d in terms of a, we must also have a ≡5 mod7 for equation1 to hold.

Therefore, when choosing a, it must satisfy a ≡5 mod7. Therefore, a

---------------

 can be 5, 12, 19,... but since a is a digit from1-9, possible a=5 or 12- but 12 is too big. So only a=5.

Wait, but 

---------------

5 mod7 is 5, so only a=5.

Wait, but earlier when I tried a=9, which is 2 mod7 (9 mod7=2), so that's not ≡5 mod7, hence equation1 wasn't satisfied. So my mistake was not considering that a must also satisfy a≡5 mod7.

Therefore, the key constraint is a ≡5 mod7, so a can be 5 or 12, but since a is a digit, only a=5 is possible. Wait, but 5 mod7 is 5, but 5 is within 1-9. However

---------------

, since we are to find the maximum N, which would prefer a as large as possible. But if a must be ≡5 mod7, then the possible a's are 5,12,19,… but within 1-9, only 5. So

---------------

 the maximum a possible is 5? That can't be right, since maybe there are higher a's if we consider the

---------------

 equations differently?

Wait, hold on. Let me retrace.

The requirement from equation1 is that 4a +2 ≡1 mod7 -->4a≡-1 mod7 --> 4a≡6 mod7. So solving for a:

4a ≡6 mod7

Multiply both sides by inverse of 4 mod7, which is 2 (since 4×2=8≡1 mod7):

a≡6×2=12≡5 mod7. So yes, a must be ≡5 mod7.

Thus, a can be 5,12,19,… but since a is a digit from1-9, only a=5 is valid. Therefore, the only possible a is 5? That would mean the maximum N is with a=5? But that seems too low. Let

---------------

 me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the derivation.

Let me re-derive the condition for equation1.



---------------

We had:

After substituting equations7,8,6 into equation1, we found that equation1 requires 4a +2 ≡1 mod7, leading to 4a ≡-1 mod7,

---------------

 which is 4a≡6 mod7, so a≡6*(4^{-1}) mod7.

Since 4^{-1}=2 mod7, so a≡6×2=12≡5 mod7. So yes, a must be ≡5 mod7.

Therefore, only a=5 is possible as

---------------

 a digit. So that would mean the maximum N is with a=5. But that can't be correct, because the problem states "the greatest four-digit number", so maybe there's a mistake here?

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution steps.

Wait let me re

---------------

compute the substitution for equation1 with variables expressed in terms of a:

We had:

2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7,

but substituting b=3a-2 +7k,

c=2a -1 +7m,

d=6a -5 +7n,

then 2*(3a-2) +3*(2a-1) + (6a -5) +7*(2k +3m +n) ≡1 mod7,

So

---------------

:

6a -4 +6a -3 +6a -5 + ... the 7*(...) part is 0 mod7,

So total for

---------------

 non-7 terms: 6a+6a+6a =18a,

-4-3-5 =-12,

So total 18a -12 ≡1 mod7,

18a mod7 is (18 mod7)=4, so 4a,

-12 mod7 is (-12 +14)=2,

Thus 4a +2 ≡1 mod7,

so 4a ≡-1 mod7,

Yes

---------------

, same as before.

Therefore, the conclusion holds: a must ≡5 mod7, so only a=5 is possible. But

---------------

 that would mean the maximum N is 5xxx, but the problem says "greatest four-digit number", so maybe I missed something?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction

---------------

 of the equations? Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps the error is in the direction of the equations. Let me try plugging in a=5.

Case a=5:

Check if a=5 satisfies a≡5 mod7? Yes, 5 mod7 is 5. So proceed

---------------

.

Compute b,c,d:

From Equation7: b≡3a-2 mod7=15-2=13 mod7=6 mod7. So b≡6 mod7.

Possible b=6 or 13 (invalid), so b=6.

Equation8: c≡2a-1 mod7=10-1=9 mod7=2 mod7. So c≡2 mod7. So c=2 or 9 (since 2+7=9).

Equation6: d≡6a-5 mod7=30-5=25 mod7=4 mod7. So d≡4 mod7. d=4 or 11 (invalid), so d=4.

Therefore, possible candidates for a=5:

b=6, c=2 or9, d=4.

Thus possible N values

---------------

:

First candidate: b=6, c=2, d=4: N=5624.

Second candidate: b=6, c=9, d=4: N=5694.

Now check these candidates

---------------

.

First, check N=5624.

Check the four conditions:

1. Change a to1: 1624. Check divisibility by7.

1624 ÷7: 7*232=1624. Exactly divisible. Good.

2. Change b to1: 5124. 5124 ÷7: 7*732=5124. Exactly divisible. Good.

3. Change c to1: 5614. 5614 ÷7: 7*802=5614. 7*800=5600, 7*2=14, total 5614. Yes, divisible.

4. Change d to1:5621. 5621 ÷7. Let's see: 7*800=5600, 5621-5600=21. 21 ÷7=3. So total 803. 7*803=5621. Yes, divisible. So N=5624 works.

Now the second candidate N=5694.

Check:

1. Change a to1:1694. 1694 ÷7. 7*242=1694. 7*240=1680, 14 more: 242. So divisible.

2. Change b to1:5194. 5194 ÷7: 7*742=5194? 7*700=4900, 7*42=294. 4900+294=5194. Yes, divisible.

3. Change c to1:5614 (same as first case). Wait, 5694 changing c (the third digit, which is 9) to1 gives 56 1 4? Wait, N is 5 (a),6 (b),9 (c),4 (d). Changing c (the third digit) to1: so 5 6 1 4 = 5614, which we already saw is divisible by7.

4. Change d to1:5691. 5691 ÷7: Let's compute 7*813=5691? 7*800=5600, 7*13=91, so total 5691. Yes, divisible. So N=5694 also works.

So both 5624 and 5694 are valid. Since we want the greatest N, 5694 is larger than 5624. So 5694 is a candidate.

Wait, so when a=5, we can get N=5694. But the

---------------

 problem asks for the greatest four-digit number with this property. However, maybe there are higher a's? But according to our previous analysis, a must be ≡5 mod7, so a=5 is the only possible digit. So

---------------

 5694 is the maximum?

But let me check a=5+7=12, which is invalid as a digit. So yes

---------------

, a=5 is the only possible.

Wait, but maybe there's an error in assuming that the equations must all be satisfied only

---------------

 through the congruences. Let me see if there are other possibilities where a is not ≡5 mod7 but the equations are satisfied through different k, m, n?

Wait, let

---------------

's suppose that even if a is not ≡5 mod7, but by choosing different k, m, n (the multiples of7), we can adjust b,c,d such that equation1 is satisfied. Because when I expressed b,c,d in terms of a, I considered only

---------------

 their congruences mod7, but their actual values can be higher by adding multiples of7, which could affect equation1.

Ah! This is a key point. The earlier substitution assumed that the equations for b,c,d are exactly

---------------

 congruent mod7, but their actual values can differ by multiples of7, so perhaps even if a is not ≡5 mod7, choosing appropriate k, m, n can adjust the values so that equation1 is satisfied.

Therefore, my previous conclusion that a must be ≡5 mod7 was only considering the minimal solutions (k,m,n=0), but in

---------------

 reality, by choosing different k,m,n, even with a not ≡5 mod7, we can have equation1 satisfied.

Therefore, my mistake was in not considering that variables b,c,d can be adjusted beyond their mod7 residues by adding 7,14 etc., which would affect the equations.

Therefore, let's re-express the variables with the added

---------------

 multiples of7:

Given that:

b = 3a -2 +7k,

c =2a -1 +7m,

d=6a -5 +7n,

where k, m, n are integers (could be positive or negative), such that b,c,d are digits (0-9).

Then, plugging into equation1:

2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7,

but substituting the expressions:

2*(3a -2 +7k) +3*(2a -1 +7m) + (6a -5 +7n) ≡1 mod7,

As

---------------

 before, this simplifies to:

(18a -12) +7*(2k +3m +n) ≡1 mod7,

Since

---------------

 18a -12 ≡4a +2 mod7,

So 4a +2 +0 ≡1 mod7,

So 4a +2 ≡1 mod7 --> 4a ≡-1 mod7, which is the same as before.

But here, the 7*(...) term is 0 mod7, so it doesn't affect the congruence. Thus, equation1 requires 4a ≡-1 mod7 regardless of k,m,n. Therefore, even if we choose different k,m,n to adjust b,c,d, the requirement on a remains a≡5 mod7. Therefore, a must be ≡5 mod7.

Therefore, even

---------------

 with different k,m,n, the requirement on a is still necessary. Therefore, a must be 5 mod7, so only a=5 is possible as a digit. Hence, the maximum possible a is 5, so the maximum N is 5xxx with a=5, and the maximum possible number

---------------

 would be when b,c,d are as large as possible, given the constraints.

So, with a=5, let's see the possible values for b,c,d again.

From above

---------------

, when a=5:

b ≡6 mod7. So possible b=6 or 13 (invalid). So b=6.

c≡2 mod7, so c=2 or 9.

d≡4 mod7, so d=4 or 11 (invalid), so d=4.

Thus, the two possibilities are:

b=6, c=2, d=4 → N=5624,

or

b=6, c=9, d=4 → N=5694,

and that's it. Since c can be 2 or9 (the next would be 16 which is too big). So 5694 is the larger one, so that's the maximum N with a=5.

But wait, the

---------------

 problem says "the greatest four-digit positive integer". Is 5694 the maximum possible? But maybe there's a higher a?

---------------

 Wait, according to our analysis, a must be 5 mod7, so a=5,12,19,... but since a is a single digit, only 5. Therefore, 5694 is the maximum.

Wait, but let me test a=12.

---------------

 Not possible, since a must be a single digit. So 5 is the highest possible a. Hmm. Let me see if there are other possibilities when a=5 but with different k,m,n?



---------------

Wait, for example, can b be 6-7= -1? No, since digits can't be negative. So the only possible values are b=6, c=2 or9, d=4.

Wait, but let

---------------

 me check if there are other possibilities if we choose different k,m,n.

Take b=3a -2 +7k. With a=5, 3*5 -2=13. So b=13 +7k. But b must be between0-9, so 13+7k must be ≤9. So

---------------

 k must be negative. Let's see:

For k=-1: 13-7=6,

k=-2:13-14=-1 (invalid). So only k=0 gives b=13 which is too big, so only k=-1 gives b=6. So that's the only valid b.

Similarly, for c=2a -1 +7m. With a=5, that's 10-1=9 +7m. To keep c≤9:

9 +7m ≤9 ⇒ m≤0,

and c ≥0 ⇒9 +7m ≥0 ⇒ m≥-1 (since 7*(-1)= -7, so 9-7=2).

Therefore m can be -1 or0.

m=0 ⇒c=9,

m=-1 ⇒c=2.

Thus, c=2 or9.

For d=6a -5 +7n. With a=5: 30-5=25 +7n.

d must be between0-9:

25 +7n ≤9 ⇒7n ≤-16 ⇒n≤-3 (since 7*(-3)= -21, 25-21=4),

and 25+7n ≥0 ⇒7n ≥-25 ⇒n≥-4 (since -4*7=-28, 25-28=-3 <0, so n≥-3.5, so n≥-3).

Thus n can be -3, -2, -1,0:

n=-3:25-21=4,

n=-2:25-14=11 (invalid),

n=-1:25-7=18 (invalid),

n=0:25 (invalid).

Therefore only n=-3 gives d=4. So d=4 only.

Thus, only two options for N:5624 and5694. So 5694 is the larger one.

Therefore, the maximum N is 5694. Wait, but let me check if there are other a's where

---------------

 a≡5 mod7 but with a higher a? Since a must be a digit, 5 is the only one. So 5694 is the maximum.

But the problem says "the greatest four-digit positive integer", so maybe I missed something? Let me test a=5 and see if there is a larger number possible with a different combination.

Wait, in

---------------

 the case of a=5, the maximum possible N is 5694. Let me see if there is another a not

---------------

 ≡5 mod7 but still allows a higher N. For example, a=6.

Wait, let's try a=6 even though according to our previous analysis it shouldn't work, just to check.

a=6:

Check if it can satisfy all equations.

First, compute the required congruences:

From Equation7: b≡3a -2 mod7=18-2=16 mod7=2 mod7 (since16-14=2). So b≡2 mod7. So b=2,9.

Equation8: c≡2a -1 mod7=12-1=11 mod7=4 mod7. So c=4,11 (invalid). So c=4.

Equation6: d≡6a-5 mod7=36-5=31 mod7=3 mod7 (31-28=3). So d≡3 mod7. So d=3,10 (invalid). So d=3.

Now, check equation1:

2b +3c +d ≡?

With a=6, possible b=2 or9, c=4, d=3.

First candidate: b=2, c=4, d=3.

Equation1: 2*2 +3*4 +3 =4+12+3=19 mod7. 19 mod7=5, which should be ≡1 mod7. Not good.

Second candidate: b=9, c=4, d=3.

Then equation1: 2*9 +3*4 +3=18+12+3=33 mod7. 33 mod7=5 (since 7*4=28, 33-28=5). Still 5≡1? No. So equation1 not satisfied.

Thus, even with a=6, the

---------------

 equation1 isn't satisfied, so a=6 is invalid.

Similarly, try a=12 mod7=5, but a=12 is invalid. So indeed, a=5 is the only possible.

Therefore, the maximum N is 5694. Wait

---------------

, but let me check another a=5 case where maybe different k,m,n give higher digits? But we saw that only b=6, c=9, d=4 is possible for the higher N.

Wait, let

---------------

 me confirm with a=5, c=9, d=4 gives N=5694, which works. Let me check another digit change:

Changing the thousands digit to1: 1694. 1694/7=242, which is exact.

Changing hundreds digit to1:5194. 5194/7=742, exact.

Changing tens digit to1:5614. 5614/7=802, exact.

Changing units digit to1:5691. 5691/7=813, exact. Yes, all work.

Now, is there a higher N? Let's see if there's another a=5 with higher digits?

Wait, with

---------------

 a=5, c can be 9 (the maximum possible for c with mod7 condition), and d=4. The hundreds digit b is fixed at6. So 5694 is the highest possible with a=5.

Thus, N=5694.

Now, the problem asks for Q and R where N divided by1000 gives quotient Q and remainder R. Since N is a four-digit number, Q is the thousands digit, which is5, and R is the last three digits:694. Therefore, Q=5, R=694. Thus Q+R=5+694=699.

Wait, but let me verify:

5694 divided by1000 is 5 with remainder 694. So yes, 5+694=699.

However, hold on a second. The problem says "Q and R be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when N is divided by 1000". The quotient Q is the number of times 1000 fits into N, so for N=5694, it's 5, and the remainder is 694. Therefore, Q+R=5+694=699.

But before I conclude, let me just make sure that 5694 is indeed the maximum N. Let me see if there's a possibility of a higher N with a different combination.

Wait, let

---------------

 me check if there's another a=5 with a different b,c,d? For example, can c be 9 and d something else? But d must be ≡4 mod7, so only 4 or11 (invalid). So d=4 is only option. So no.

Alternatively, if

---------------

 there is another set of equations where a is not 5, but through different k,m,n values, but as we saw, that's impossible because a must be ≡5 mod7.

Therefore, I think 5694 is correct. So the answer should be 5+694=699, so 699.

Wait, but I

---------------

 need to check the problem once again to ensure I didn't misinterpret anything.

Problem statement:

"whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7"

Yes, so changing any single digit to 1 must make it divisible by7. We checked all four cases for N=5694, and they worked.

Therefore, I think the answer is 699.

Wait, but let

---------------

 me check another possible N just in case. Suppose someone thinks a=4 mod7 or something else, but no.

Alternatively, maybe there's another a=5 case where c

---------------

 is 9, and b is higher? But b must be 6 mod7, so 6 or 13 (invalid). So no.

Thus, I think the final answer is 699.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{699}


To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number \( N \) such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We then need to compute \( Q + R \) where \( Q \) is the quotient and \( R \) is the remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000.

We denote the digits of \( N \) as \( a, b, c, d \) such that \( N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \). The conditions given translate to four congruence equations modulo 7. After setting up and simplifying these equations, we derive the following key equations:

1. \( 2b + 3c + d \equiv 1 \mod 7 \)
2. \( 6a + 3c + d \equiv 5 \mod 7 \)
3. \( 6a + 2b + d \equiv 4 \mod 7 \)
4. \( 6a + 2b + 3c \equiv 6 \mod 7 \)

Through solving these equations, we find that \( a \) must be congruent to 5 modulo 7. The only valid digit for \( a \) is 5. Substituting \( a = 5 \) into the equations, we find:

- \( b \equiv 6 \mod 7 \) (so \( b = 6 \))
- \( c \equiv 2 \mod 7 \) (so \( c = 2 \) or \( 9 \))
- \( d \equiv 4 \mod 7 \) (so \( d = 4 \))

The largest possible number with these digits is \( N = 5694 \) (choosing the largest \( c = 9 \)). Verifying all conditions, we confirm \( 5694 \) meets the requirements.

When \( N = 5694 \) is divided by 1000, the quotient \( Q \) is 5 and the remainder \( R \) is 694. Thus, \( Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699 \).

The final answer is \(\boxed{699}\).<|im_end|>
