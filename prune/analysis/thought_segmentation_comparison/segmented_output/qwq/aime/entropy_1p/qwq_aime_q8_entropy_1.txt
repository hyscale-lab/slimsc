Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where there are two real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, and they satisfy these logarithmic equations: log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^(4y) also equals 10. And I need to find the product xy. Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but maybe I can convert them to exponential form or use some logarithm properties to simplify.

First, let me write down the given equations again to make sure I have them right:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

Alright, starting with the first equation. Remember that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So maybe I can apply that property here. Let's try that for the first equation:

log_x(y^x) = x * log_x(y) = 10. 

So, that simplifies to x * log_x(y) = 10. Hmm, log_x(y) is the exponent you need to raise x to get y. Let me denote log_x(y) as some variable to make it easier. Let's say let’s set a = log_x(y). Then by definition of logarithm, x^a = y. 

So substituting back into the first equation, we have x * a = 10. But since a is log_x(y), which is log_x(y) = a, so that gives x * log_x(y) = 10. Hmm, maybe another way to think about it. Alternatively, using the identity that log_b(b^k) = k. Wait, but here the base is x and the argument is y^x, so maybe not directly applicable. Wait, but if I can express log_x(y^x) as x * log_x(y), which is what I did before. 

Alternatively, using the change of base formula, log_x(y^x) can be written as (ln(y^x))/(ln(x)) = (x ln y)/(ln x) = 10. So that gives x*(ln y / ln x) = 10. 

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Applying the same logarithm power rule: 4y * log_y(x) = 10. Let me denote log_y(x) as another variable, maybe b. Let me see.

Alternatively, using natural logs again: log_y(x^{4y}) = (ln x^{4y}) / ln y = (4y ln x)/ln y = 10. 

So, now I have two equations:

1. (x ln y) / ln x = 10

2. (4y ln x) / ln y = 10

Hmm, so maybe if I let’s denote ln x as A and ln y as B. Let me try that substitution. Let A = ln x and B = ln y. Then, since x and y are greater than 1, A and B are positive real numbers.

Then, equation 1 becomes (x * B)/A = 10. But x is e^A, right? Because ln x = A => x = e^A. Similarly, y = e^B. So substituting x = e^A and y = e^B into equation 1:

(e^A * B)/A = 10

Similarly, equation 2: (4y * A)/B = 10. Substituting y = e^B:

(4 * e^B * A)/B = 10

Hmm, so now I have two equations in terms of A and B:

1. (e^A * B)/A = 10

2. (4 * e^B * A)/B = 10

This looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can manipulate them to find a relationship between A and B. Let me see.

Let me denote equation 1 as:

(e^A * B) = 10 A → e^A * B = 10 A → e^A = (10 A)/B → equation 1a

Equation 2:

4 e^B * A = 10 B → e^B = (10 B)/(4 A) → equation 2a

Hmm, so now equation

---------------

 1a gives e^A in terms of A and B, and equation 2a gives e^B in terms of A and B. Maybe I can substitute one into the other?

Alternatively, perhaps multiply the two equations together. Let me see:

Multiply equation 1 and equation 2:

(e^A * B / A) * (4 e^B * A / B) ) = 10 * 10 = 100

Simplify left side:

(e^A * B / A) * (4 e^B * A / B) = (e^A * e^B) * (B / A) * (4 A / B) ) 

The B cancels, A cancels, so we have e^(A+B) *4 = 100

Therefore:

e^(A+B) = 100 / 4 = 25

Thus, e^(A+B) = 25 → A + B = ln(25)

So that's a relationship between A and B. Let me note that:

A + B = ln(25) = ln(5^2) = 2 ln 5. 

So, A + B = 2 ln 5.

Now, perhaps

---------------

 I can use this in equations 1a and 2a.

From equation 1a: e^A = (10 A)/B

From equation 2a: e^B = (10 B)/(4 A) = (5 B)/(2 A)

Let me see if I can express e^(A+B) as e^A * e^B. Since e^(A+B) = e^A * e^B =25 (from earlier). 

So substituting e^A and e^B from equations 1a and 2a:

e^A * e^B = (10A / B) * (5B / 2A) ) = (10A / B)*(5B)/(2A) 

Simplify:

The A cancels, the B cancels, so:

(10 *5)/(2) = 50/2 =25. 

Which matches e^(A+B)=25. So that checks out. So that doesn't give us new information, just confirms the consistency. 

Hmm, so I need another way to relate A and B. Let me see. Since A + B = 2 ln5, perhaps express B = 2 ln5 - A, then substitute into equation 1a or 2a.

Let me try substituting into equation 1a:

From equation 1a: e^A = (10 A)/B

But B = 2 ln5 - A. So,

e^A = (10 A)/(2 ln5 - A)

Similarly, equation 2a gives e^B = (5 B)/(2 A). Let me see if using B = 2 ln5 - A here would also give the same equation?

Alternatively, perhaps pick

---------------

 one equation and work with it. Let me focus on equation 1a and substitute B = 2 ln5 - A into it. 

So:

e^A = (10 A)/(2 ln5 - A)

This is an equation in terms of A. Let me denote C = A for simplicity. Then,

e^C = (10 C)/(2 ln5 - C)

Hmm, solving for C here might not be straightforward algebraically. Maybe need to think

---------------

 of possible values that satisfy this equation? Since x and y are greater than 1, so A and B must be positive. Also, since B = 2 ln5 - C, so 2 ln5 - C must be positive, so C < 2 ln5. 

Alternatively, maybe assume that A and B are multiples of ln5? Let me see. Let me try some substitutions. Let me suppose that A = k ln5 and B = (2 -k) ln5, since A + B = 2 ln5. 

Let me try that substitution. Let A = k ln5, so B = (2 -k) ln5. Then plug into equation 1a:

e^{k ln5} = (10 * k ln5)/ [ (2 -k) ln5 ]

Simplify left side: e^{k ln5} = 5^k

Right side: (10 k ln5)/[ (2 -k) ln5 ] = 10k/(2 -k)

So equation becomes:

5^k = 10k/(2 -k)

Hmm, so now we have an equation in terms of k. Let me see if I can find a k such that this holds. Let me try some integer values.

First, let me see if k is an integer. Let me try k=1:

Left:5^1 =5. Right:10*1/(2-1)=10. Not equal.

k=2: Left:25. Right:10*2/(0) → division by zero. Not allowed.

k=0: Left:1. Right:0/(2) =0. Not equal.

k= 0.5: Let's try fractions. k=1/2:

Left: sqrt(5) ≈2.236. Right: 10*(0.5)/(2 -0.5)=5/1.5≈3.333. Not equal.

k= 1. Let's see, tried that. k

---------------

= 1. Let me try k= 2/3:

Left:5^(2/3)≈ cube root of 25 ≈2.924. Right:10*(2/3)/(2 -2/3)= (20/3)/(4/3)=5. So 5 vs approx2.924. Not equal.

Hmm, not

---------------

 quite. Maybe k= 1. Let me check again. Wait, k=1 gives left 5, right 10. Not equal. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps k= (something else). Let me see, suppose k= ln something? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe try

---------------

 to set up an equation where 5^k (2 -k) =10k.

So 5^k (2 -k) -10k =0. Let me see if I can find a solution numerically.

Let me try k=1. Let's see:

5^1*(2-1) -10*1 =5*1 -10= -5. Negative.

At k=0. Let's see, 5^0*(2 -0) -10*0=2 -0=2>0.

So between k=0 and k=1, the function goes from 2 to -5. So by Intermediate Value Theorem, there's a root between 0 and1.

Similarly, between k=1 and k approaching 2, let's see at k=1.5:

5^1.5 is sqrt(5^3)=sqrt(125)=~11.18. So 11.18*(2-1.5)=11.18*0.5≈5.59. 10*1.5=15. So 5.59-15≈-9.41 <0.

Hmm, so between k=0 and1, it crosses zero. Let me try k=0.5:

5^0.5≈2.236*(2-0.5)=2.236*1.5≈3.354. 10*0.5=5. So 3.354-5≈-1.646. Negative.

Wait, so at k=0, the value was 2, at k=0.5 it's -1.6, so between 0 and 0.5?

Wait, k=0.25:

5^0.25≈sqrt(sqrt(5))≈1.495. (2 -0.25)=1.75. So 1.495*1.75≈2.616. 10*0.25=2.5. So 2.616 -2.5≈0.116. Positive.

So between 0.25 and 0.5.

At k=0.3:

5^0.3 ≈ e^{0.3 ln5} ≈ e^{0.3*1.609}≈e^{0.4827}≈1.620.

(2 -0.3)=1.7. 1.620 *1.7≈2.754. 10*0.3=3. So 2.754 -3≈-0.246. Negative.

Hmm, so between 0.25 and 0.3:

At k=0.25, value≈0.116, at k=0.3≈-0.246. Let me try k=0.275:

5^0.275 ≈ e^{0.275 *1.609}≈e^{0.4429

---------------

}≈1.557.

(2-0.275)=1.725. 1.557 *1.725≈2.687. 10*0.275=2.75. 2.687-2.75≈-0.063. Close.

k=0.26:

5^0.26 ≈ e^{0.26*1.609}=e^{0.418}≈1.519.

(2-0.26)=1.74. 1.519*1.74≈2.648. 10*0.26=2.6. 2.648-2.6≈0.048.

So between 0.26 and 0.275. Let me try k=0.265:

5^0.265≈ e^{0.265*1.609}= e^{0.426}≈1.531.

1.531*(2 -0.265)=1.531*(1.735)≈1.531*1.735≈2.657. 10*0.265=2.65. So 2.657-2.65≈0.007.

Very close. So at k≈0.265, the value is approximately 0.007. Close

---------------

 to zero. 

k=0.266:

0.266*1.609≈0.428. e^0.428≈1.534.

(2 -0.266)=1.734. 1.534*1.734≈2.66. 10*0.266≈2.66. So 2.66 -2.66≈0. So that

---------------

's the solution?

Wait, so k≈0.266. Let me check:

k=0.266:

Left side:5^0.266 ≈ e^{0.266*1.609} ≈ e^{0.428} ≈1.534.

Right side:10k/(2 -k) =10*(0.266)/(1.734)=2.66/1.734≈1.534. 

Yes, so that works. So k≈0.266. But

---------------

 that's an approximate solution. But since the problem is likely expecting an exact answer, maybe there's an exact value here. Hmm, perhaps my substitution with k is complicating things? Maybe there's another approach.

Let me go back to the original equations and see if I can manipulate them differently.

Original equations:

1. log_x(y^x) =10 → x log_x(y)=10 → log_x(y)=10/x

2. log_y(x^{4y})=10 →4y log_y(x)=10 → log_y(x)=10/(4y)=5/(2y)

But note that log_x(y) and log_y(x) are reciprocals. Because log_b(a) = 1/(log_a(b)). So, log_x(y) =1/(log_y(x)). 

Therefore, from equation 1 and 2:

log_x(y)=10/x and log_y(x)=5/(2y). 

But since log_x(y)=1/(log_y(x)), so substituting:

10/x = 1/(5/(2y)) = 2y/5

Therefore, 10/x = (2y)/5 → cross multiplying: 10*5 = 2y*x → 50=2xy → xy=25. Wait, that's straightforward?

Wait, that seems much simpler. Did I overcomplicate it earlier?

Let me check again. 

Yes

---------------

, because log_x(y) = 10/x, and log_y(x)=5/(2y). Since they are reciprocals:

log_x(y) = 1/(log_y(x)) → 10/x = 1/(5/(2y)) → 10/x = 2y/5 → cross multiply: 10*5 = 2y*x → 50=2xy → xy=25. So that's it. So the answer is 25?

Wait, that's way simpler. Why didn't I think of that earlier? Because I got

---------------

 bogged down in substitution with A and B. So that was a better approach. 

So, let me verify this. Let me see:

Given that log_x(y^x)=10, so log_x(y^x)=x log_x(y)=10 → log_x(y)=10/x.

Similarly, log_y(x^{4y})=4y log_y(x)=10 → log_y(x)=10/(4y)=5/(2y).

Since log_x(y) = 1/log_y(x), so substituting:

10/x = 1/(5/(2y)) → 10/x = 2y/5 → cross multiply: 50 = 2xy → xy=25. 

So the answer is 25. 

Hmm, that was straightforward. I overcomplicated it by going into natural logs and substitutions. But

---------------

 that's a common pitfall. So, the key was to recognize the reciprocal relationship between the two logarithms. 

Let me just check if that's consistent with my earlier equations where I had A + B = 2 ln5. If xy=25, then x and y are numbers such that their product is 25. Let me see if that holds with the other equations.

Suppose xy=25. Let me pick numbers. Let me suppose x=5, then y=5. But then check the equations. Wait, let me see:

Suppose x=5 and y=5. Then log_x(y^x)=log_5(5^5)=5, which is not 10. So that doesn't work. Hmm, so maybe x and y are not 5 each, but their product is 25. Let me see.

Alternatively, suppose x= sqrt(25)=5, but same as before. Maybe x and y are different.

Suppose x= sqrt(25)=5, then y=5, which didn't work. Let me try another pair. Let me see

---------------

.

Suppose x= something else. Let me think, let me suppose that xy=25, so y=25/x. Let me plug into the equations.

First equation: log_x(y^x)= log_x( (25/x)^x )=x * log_x(25/x). Let me compute that.

log_x(25/x) = log_x(25) - log_x(x) = log_x(25) -1. So the first equation becomes x*(log_x(25) -1)=10.

Similarly, log_x(25) is log_x(5^2)=2 log_x(5). Let me set that as 2 log_x(5). Hmm, but maybe this

---------------

 is getting too involved again.

Alternatively, since we already derived through reciprocal relationship that xy=25, and that's consistent with the equations, perhaps that is the answer. Since the problem states that such real numbers exist, so the answer is 25.

Alternatively, to confirm, let me suppose

---------------

 that xy=25, so y=25/x. Then let me see if the original equations can be satisfied.

Take first equation: log_x(y^x)=10. Since y=25/x, then y^x=(25/x)^x. So log_x( (25/x)^x ) = log_x(25^x /x^x )= log_x( (25/x)^x )=x log_x(25/x)=x [log_x(25) - log_x(x)] =x [log_x(25) -1]. 

Set this equal to 10:

x [log_x(25) -1] =10.

Let me let’s denote log_x(25) as k. Then x*(k -1)=10. But k is log_x(25)= ln25/lnx. Hmm, maybe another

---------------

 substitution.

Alternatively, let me write log_x(25)= log_x(5^2)=2 log_x(5). Let me set log_x(5)=m. Then log_x(25)=2m, so equation becomes x*(2m -1)=10.

Also, since m=log_x(5), that means x^m =5. So x^m=5 → x=5^{1/m}.

Hmm, so

---------------

 substituting x=5^{1/m} into the equation:

5^{1/m}*(2m -1)=10.

This seems a bit complex, but maybe pick a value of m that makes this equation true. Let me see if m=1:

Then x=5^{1}=5. Then 5*(2*1 -1)=5*1=5≠10. Not good.

m=2:

x=5^{1/2}=sqrt(5). Then sqrt(5)*(2*2 -1)=sqrt(5)*3≈6.708≠10.

m= (

---------------

something else). Let me see:

Suppose 2m -1 = 10/(5^{1/m} )

Let me suppose that m= log_x(5). Let me see, perhaps m=2:

Wait, maybe

---------------

 m= log_x(5)=2, so x= sqrt(5). Then equation is sqrt(5)*(4-1)=sqrt(5)*3≈6.708, not 10.

Hmm, perhaps m= log_x(5)= (ln5)/lnx. Let me see:

Alternatively, maybe m

---------------

= log_x(5)= t, so x=5^{1/t}

Then equation: 5^{1/t}*(2t -1)=10.

This is a transcendental equation, which may not have an algebraic solution. But since the problem states that real numbers exist, so there

---------------

 must be a solution. Since we already derived through the reciprocal relationship that xy=25, and that comes from valid manipulations, perhaps that's sufficient, even if we can’t find exact x and y, but the question only asks for xy, so 25 is the answer. 

Therefore, I think the answer is 25.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{25}


Given the equations \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\), we start by using logarithm properties to simplify them.

For the first equation:
\[
\log_x(y^x) = x \log_x(y) = 10
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x}
\]

For the second equation:
\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\log_y(x) = \frac{10}{4y} = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

We know that \(\log_x(y)\) and \(\log_y(x)\) are reciprocals of each other. Therefore:
\[
\log_x(y) = \frac{1}{\log_y(x)}
\]

Substituting the expressions we found:
\[
\frac{10}{x} = \frac{1}{\frac{5}{2y}}
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side:
\[
\frac{10}{x} = \frac{2y}{5}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
10 \cdot 5 = 2y \cdot x
\]
\[
50 = 2xy
\]
\[
xy = 25
\]

Thus, the product \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).<|im_end|>
