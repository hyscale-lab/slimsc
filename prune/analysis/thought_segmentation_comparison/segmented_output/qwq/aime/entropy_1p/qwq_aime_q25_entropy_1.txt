Okay, so I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and AD intersects ω again at P. The sides are given as AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n. Hmm, let's think.

First, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle ω of triangle ABC, D is the exsymmedian point or something? Wait, actually, the intersection of two tangents from a point to a circle gives that point as the exsimilicenter or something. Alternatively, maybe I can use properties related to power of a point.

Power of a point D with respect to ω: since DB and DC are tangents, then DB = DC, right? Because the lengths of tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal. So DB = DC. That might be useful.

Also, since AD passes through A and intersects ω again at P, so AP is the length from A to P along that line. Maybe I can use power of point D with respect to ω, or use some intersecting chords theorem?

Alternatively, maybe use harmonic division or projective geometry concepts? Hmm, perhaps using inversion?

Alternatively, coordinate geometry? Maybe set coordinates for triangle ABC and compute the required points? Let me see. Let me first try to recall some theorems related to this configuration.

Another thought: Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, then line AD is called the symmedian? Wait, the symmedian of triangle ABC with respect to vertex A? Hmm, because

---------------

 the symmedian is the reflection of the median over the angle bisector, but also, in some contexts, the symmedian can be related to the tangents. Wait, actually, the symmedian can be constructed by taking the tangents at B and C and then connecting their intersection to A, which might be the case here. So perhaps line AD is the symmedian of triangle ABC. If that's true, then AP can be found using properties of symmedians.

If

---------------

 AD is the symmedian, then the point P is where the symmedian meets the circumcircle again, so maybe there's a formula for the length AP in terms of the sides of the triangle?

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 use coordinates. Let me try coordinate geometry.

Let me set coordinate system with point C at the origin (0,0), point B at (9,0) since BC is 9 units, but wait, actually, hold on. Wait, the sides are AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Wait, the sides are AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So triangle ABC has sides of length 5, 9, 10. Wait, let me confirm the triangle inequality: 5 + 9 > 10 (14>10), 5+10>9 (15>9), 9+10>5 (19>5). So that's okay. So let

---------------

's set coordinates.

Let me place point C at (0,0), point B at (9,0). Then point A is somewhere such that AC=10 and AB=5. Let me find coordinates of point A.

Let me denote coordinates: Let’s let C=(0,0), B=(9,0). Let A=(x,y). Then AC=10: so sqrt(x² + y²)=10, so x² + y²=100. AB=5: distance from A to B (9,0) is sqrt((x-9)^2 + y²)=5, so (x-9)^2 + y²=25.

So subtract the two equations: (x-9)^2 + y² - (x² + y²) =25 -100 ⇒ (x² -18x +81) -x² = -75 ⇒ -18x +81 = -75 ⇒ -18x = -156 ⇒ x = 156/18 = 26/3 ≈ 8.666...

Hmm, so x-coordinate of A is 26/3. Then y² =100 -x² = 100 - (26/3)^2. Let's compute that:

26 squared is 676, so (26/3)^2 = 676/9. So y² = 100 - 676/9 = (900 -676)/9 = 224/9. So y= sqrt(224/9)= (sqrt(224))/3 = (4*sqrt(14))/3. So coordinates of A are (26/3, (4√14)/3). Hmm, okay. So coordinates are set.

Now, need to find the circumcircle ω of triangle ABC. Let me compute the circumradius or the equation of the circle.

Since points A, B, C are on the circle. Let's find the equation of the circle passing through C(0,0), B(9,0), and A(26/3, 4√14/3).

The general equation of a circle is x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F =0. Since it passes through (0,0), plugging in gives 0 +0 +0 +0 +F=0 ⇒ F=0.

So equation is x² + y² + Dx + Ey =0.

Now plug in point B(9,0):

9² +0 +9D +0 =0 ⇒ 81 +9D =0 ⇒ D= -9.

Wait, so D= -9. So equation becomes x² + y² -9x + Ey =0.

Now plug in point A(26/3, 4√14/3):

( (26/3)^2 ) + ( (4√14/3)^2 ) -9*(26/3) + E*(4√14/3) =0.

Compute each term:

(26/3)^2 = 676/9,

(4√14 /3)^2 = 16*14 /9 = 224/9,

-9*(26/3) = -234/3 = -78,

So adding up

---------------

 the first three terms:

676/9 + 224/9 -78 + (4√14 /3) E =0

Total of first two terms: (676 +224)/9 = 900/9 =100. Then 100 -78 =22. So:

22 + (4√14 /3) E =0 ⇒ (4√14 /3) E = -22 ⇒ E= (-22 *3)/(4√14) = (-66)/(4√14) = (-33)/(2√14). Rationalizing the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by √14:

E= (-33√14)/(2*14) = (-33√14)/28.

So the equation of the circle is x² + y² -9x + [ (-33√14)/28 ] y =0. Hmm, this is getting a bit messy. Maybe there's a better approach?

Alternatively, perhaps compute the circumradius using the formula:

R = (a b c)/(4 area). Let's try that. Let me compute the area first.

Given triangle sides a=BC=9, b=AC=10, c=AB=5. Wait, in standard notation, a is BC opposite A, b is AC opposite B, c is AB opposite C. Wait, but maybe

---------------

 it's better to recall the formula:

Area = √[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)] where s=(a+b+c)/2.

Compute semi-perimeter s=(5+9+10)/2=24/2=12.

Area = √[12(12-5)(12-9)(12-10)] = √[12*7*3*2] = √[504] = √(16*31.5) Wait, 504 factors: 16*31.5? Wait 504=16*31.5? Hmm, 16*31.5=504? 16*30=480, 16*1.5=24, so yes. But maybe better to factor into primes:

504 = 16*31.5? Wait actually, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, but that

---------------

's not helpful. Let me factor 504:

504= 8*63=8*7*9= 8*7*3^2. So sqrt(504)=sqrt(8*7*9)=sqrt(8)*sqrt(7)*sqrt(9)= 2√2 * 3 * √7= 6√14. So area is 6√14.

Therefore, the area is 6√14. Then the circumradius R = (a b c)/(4 area) = (5*9*10)/(4*6√14) = 450/(24√14) = (450)/(24√14) = (75)/(4√14). Rationalizing denominator: 75√14/(4*14)= 75√14 /56. Hmm, so R=75√14 /56. Hmm, okay, but not sure if that helps yet.

Alternatively, maybe use coordinates to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C.

The tangent at point B to the circle ω. The tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, if we can find the slope of OB, where O is the center of the circle, then the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB.

Wait, first, maybe

---------------

 we need the coordinates of the center O of the circle. Since we have the equation of the circle, let me recall that the general equation x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F =0 has center at (-D/2, -E/2). Earlier, we had D = -9, E = (-33√14)/28, F=0. Wait, so the center O is at (-D/2, -E/2) = (9/2, (33√14)/(2*28*2))? Wait, hold on.

Wait, the

---------------

 center coordinates are (-D/2, -E/2). Since D was -9, so -D/2 is 9/2. And E was (-33√14)/28, so -E/2 is (33√14)/56. Therefore, center O is at (9/2, (33√14)/56). Hmm, complicated coordinates. Maybe there's a better way?

Alternatively, since

---------------

 we can compute the tangent lines at B and C.

The tangent at point B (9,0): The equation of tangent at point (x1,y1) on circle x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F =0 is xx1 + yy1 + D(x + x1)/2 + E(y + y1)/2 + F =0. Wait, maybe another formula?

Alternatively, the tangent line at point B can be found using the derivative or by knowing that it's perpendicular to the radius. Let me try the radius from center O to point B.

Coordinates of O: (9/2, 33√14 /56). Coordinates of B: (9,0). The vector from O to B is (9 - 9/2, 0 - 33√14/56) = (9/2, -33√14/56). So the slope of OB is [ -33√14 /56 ] / (9/2) = (-33√14)/56 * 2/9 = (-33√14)/252 = (-11√14)/84.

Therefore, the tangent at B is perpendicular to this, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: 84/(11√14). Let's rationalize that: 84/(11√14) = (84√14)/(11*14)= (84√14)/(154)= (42√14)/77= (6√14)/11. Wait, let me check:

Wait, slope of OB is m1 = (-11√14)/84? Wait, perhaps

---------------

 miscalculation. Let me recalculate:

The slope of OB is (y_B - y_O)/(x_B - x_O). Since B is (9,0) and O is (9/2, 33√14 /56):

Δy = 0 - 33√14 /56 = -33√14 /56

Δx = 9 - 9/2 = 9/2

Thus slope m1 = (Δy)/(Δx) = (-33√14 /56 ) / (9/2) = (-33√14)/56 * 2/9 = (-33√14 *2)/(56*9) = (-66√14)/(504) = (-11√14)/84. Yes, so slope of OB is -11√14 /84, so the tangent line at B has slope perpendicular, which is reciprocal and opposite sign: 84/(11√14). To rationalize, multiply numerator and denominator by √14:

84/(11√14) = (84√14)/(11*14) = (84/14)*√14 /11 = 6√14 /11. So slope of tangent at B is 6√14 /11.

Similarly, the tangent at point C (0,0). Let's find the slope of the tangent at C. The radius OC is from O (9/2, 33√14/56) to C (0,0). So the slope of OC is (33√14/56 -0)/(9/2 -0) = (33√14/56)/(9/2) = (33√14)/56 * 2/9 = (66√14)/(504) = (11√14)/84. Therefore, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC, so slope is - (84)/(11√14). Rationalizing:

-84/(11√14) = - (84√14)/(11*14) = -6√14/11. So the tangent at C has slope -6√14/11.

Now, the tangent lines at B and C meet at point D. Let's find equations of these two tangent lines and then find their intersection point D.

First, tangent at B: passes through B (9,0) with slope 6√14 /11.

Equation: y -0 = (6√14 /11)(x -9).

Similarly, tangent at C: passes through C (0,0) with slope -6√14 /11.

Equation: y = (-6√14 /11)x.

Find D by solving these two equations:

Set (6√14 /11)(x -9) = (-6√14 /11)x

Multiply both sides by 11/(6√14) to eliminate denominators:

(x -9) = -x

Thus x -9 = -x ⇒ 2x =9 ⇒ x=9/2.

Then plug into tangent at C: y= (-6√14 /11)*(9/2)= (-54√14)/(22)= (-27√14)/11.

Wait, so point D is at (9/2, -27√14/11). Hmm, okay. That's the coordinates of D.

Now, need to find point P which is the second intersection of line AD with the circumcircle ω. Since A is (26/3, 4√14/3), and D is (9/2, -27√14/11). Let me parametrize line AD.

First, find parametric equations for line AD.

Let me write the coordinates of A and D:

A: (26/3, 4√14/3)

D: (9/2, -27√14/11)

Let me compute the direction vector from A to D:

Δx = 9/2 -26/3 = (27/6 -52/6)= (-25/6)

Δy = (-27√14/11 - 4√14/3) = √14*(-27/11 -4/3) = √14*(-81/33 -44/33)= √14*(-125/33)

So direction vector is (-25/6, -125√14 /33). Let me write parametric equations:

x = 26/3 + t*(-25/6)

y = 4√14/3 + t*(-125√14 /33)

We need to find the other intersection point P of this line with the circumcircle ω. Since A is already on both the line and the circle, the other intersection is P. So we can substitute the parametric equations into the circle equation and solve for t ≠0.

The circle equation was x² + y² -9x + Ey =0, where E was (-33√14)/28. Wait, let me recall:

Earlier, the equation was x² + y² -9x + [ (-33√14)/28 ] y =0.

Alternatively, maybe plug

---------------

 in the parametric equations into the general circle equation.

Alternatively, since we have coordinates for A, B, C, perhaps use

---------------

 the equation in terms of coordinates. Let me proceed step by step.

Let me substitute x and y from parametric equations into the circle equation:

x² + y² -9x + Ey =0, where E = (-33√14)/28.

So substituting:

[ (26/3 - (25/6)t )² + ( (4√14/3) + (-125√14/33)t )² ] -9*(26/3 - (25/6)t ) + E*(4√14/3 + (-125√14/33)t ) =0.

This looks really complicated. Maybe there is a smarter way?

Alternatively, since we know that point P lies on line AD and on the circumcircle, and since A is already on both, we can use the parametric approach but perhaps use

---------------

 a parameter s such that when s=0, we are at A, and s=1 at D. But since P is the other intersection, it might correspond to some s value.

Alternatively, use power of a point. Since D lies outside the circle, the power of D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC² (since they are tangent lengths). Also, power of D is equal to DP * DA, since line DA intersects the circle at A and P. Therefore, Power of D: DB² = DP * DA. So, if we can compute DA and solve for DP, then AP = DA - DP or DP - DA depending on the direction.

Wait, this seems promising. Let me think.

Power of a point D with respect to ω is equal to the square of the tangent length: DB² = DC² = DP * DA. Since line DA passes through A and P, so DA is the length from D to A, and DP is from D to P. Since P is on the other side of the circle from A, then DP = DA + AP? Wait, no

---------------

, depending on the direction. Wait, actually, the power formula is DB² = DP * DA, where DA is the length from D to A, and DP is from D to P. But since P is another intersection point, if A is between D and P, then DP = DA + AP. Alternatively, if P is between D and A, then DA = DP + PA. But in this case, since D is outside the circle, and A is on the circle, so the line DA starts at D, goes through A, and then exits the circle again at P. Wait, actually, no

---------------

. Since A is already on the circle, the line DA starts at D, goes through A, and then the other intersection is P. Wait, but the

---------------

 power of point D is DB² = DP * DA, where DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. Wait, but in the power of a point formula, if a line through D intersects the circle at X and Y, then DX * DY = DB². Here, the line DA intersects the circle at A and P, so DA * DP = DB². Wait, but which is which? Let me recall the exact formula: If two points are on the line through D, with D outside, then the power is equal to the product of the distances from D to each intersection point. So, if the points are A and P, then DA * DP = power. But since A is closer to D than P? Not sure, but the

---------------

 formula is DA * DP = power. Wait, actually, if D is outside, and the line intersects the circle at X and Y with X closer to D, then DX * DY = power. So in our case, if A is on the circle and on the line DA, then either A is X or Y. Since D is outside, and line DA passes through A (on the circle) and goes to P, which is another point on the circle. Wait, but since

---------------

 the line starts at D, goes through A, then continues to P. Wait, but A is already on the circle, so the two intersection points are A and P, so the power is DA * DP = DB². But since

---------------

 A is between D and P, then DA * DP = DB². Wait, but if the order is D---A---P, then DA * DP = DA*(DA + AP) = DB². Hmm, but maybe

---------------

 we can write AP = DP - DA, but need to be careful with the signs. Alternatively, let me just use algebra.

Let me denote DA as the distance from D to A, and DP as the distance from D to P. Then, according to power of a point:

DA * DP = DB².

We can compute DA, and DB is the length of the tangent from D to the circle, which is equal to DB = DC. Since DB is the tangent, so DB = sqrt(OD² - R²)? Wait, maybe better to compute DB directly since we have coordinates of D and B.

Coordinates of D: (9/2, -27√14 /11 )

Coordinates of B: (9,0)

Compute DB distance squared:

Δx = 9 - 9/2 = 9/2, Δy = 0 - (-27√14 /11 )= 27√14 /11

Thus DB² = (9/2)^2 + (27√14 /11)^2

Compute each term:

(9/2)^2 =81/4

(27√14 /11)^2 = (27²)*(14)/(11²)= 729*14 /121 = 10206 /121

Thus DB² = 81/4 + 10206/121

To add these, find a common denominator, which is 4*121=484.

81/4 = (81*121)/484 = 9801/484

10206/121 = (10206*4)/484 = 40824/484

Thus total DB² = (9801 +40824)/484 = 50625 /484

Hmm, 50625 divided by 484. Let me see 50625 is 225² (since 225² = 50625), and 484 is 22². So DB² = (225/22)^2. So DB = 225/22.

Therefore, power of D is DB² = (225/22)^2. Wait, but actually, DB

---------------

 squared is 50625/484, so yes, that is (225/22)^2.

Now, compute DA, the distance between D and A.

Coordinates of D: (9/2, -27√14/11 )

Coordinates of A: (26/3, 4√14/3 )

Compute Δx = 26/3 -9/2 = (52/6 -27/6)=25/6

Δy = 4√14/3 - (-27√14/11)= 4√14/3 +27√14/11 = √14*(4/3 +27/11)= √14*( (44 +81)/33 )= √14*(125/33 )

Thus DA squared is (25/6)^2 + (125√14/33)^2

Compute each term:

(25/6)^2 =625/36

(125√14 /33)^2 = (125²)*(14)/(33²)= 15625*14 /1089 = 218750 /1089

So DA² = 625/36 + 218750/1089

Again, common denominator 36*1089. Let me compute:

625/36 = (625*1089)/(36*1089)

218750/1089 = (218750*36)/(36*1089)

But

---------------

 this might be tedious. Alternatively, let me see if I can factor out terms:

First term: 625/36

Second term: 218750/1089 = (218750 ÷ 25)/ (1089 ÷25 ) Hmm, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, compute numerators:

625/36 ≈ 17.3611

218750/1089 ≈ 200.872

Total ≈ 218.233, but exact value needed.

Alternatively, note that 218750 = 125^2 *14, and 1089 is 33². Let me see:

Wait, 125^2 is 15625, so 15625*14 = 218,750. Yes. So,

---------------

 125² *14 /33².

So DA² = (25/6)^2 + (125√14 /33)^2 = (25²)/(6²) + (125² *14)/(33²)

Factor out 25² / (33²):

Wait, 25² is common in both terms? Let me see:

First term: 25² /6² = (25/6)^2

Second term: (125)^2 *14 /33² = (25*5)^2 *14 /33² =25² *25*14 /33²? Wait no, (125)^2 is 25² *5². So:

Second term: 25² *5² *14 /33²

Therefore, DA² = 25² [ (1/6²) + (5² *14)/33² ]

Let me factor 25² and compute the bracket:

Let me compute the bracket term:

(1/36) + (25*14)/ (33²) = 1/36 + 350/(1089)

Convert to common denominator 36*1089= 39204

1/36 = 1089/39204

350/1089 = 350*36 /39204 = 12600/39204

Total: (1089 +12600)/39204 = 13689 /39204

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Divide numerator and denominator by 9: numerator 1521, denominator 4356

Again divide by 3: 507 /1452, again divide by 3: 169 / 484

Ah! So the bracket term simplifies to 169/484.

Therefore DA² =25²*(169/484) = (25*13)^2 / (22²) since 169=13² and 484=22².

Therefore DA² = (325/22)^2 ⇒ DA = 325/22.

Therefore DA is 325/22.

So Power

---------------

 of D: DA * DP = DB² ⇒ (325/22)*DP = (225/22)^2 ⇒ DP = (225/22)^2 / (325/22) )= (225^2)/(22 *325 )

Simplify:

225 = 15² = 25*9, 325=25*13. So:

DP = (25² *9²)/(22 *25*13 ) = (25*9²)/(22*13 )

Simplify 25/25 cancels, so 9²/(22*13) *25? Wait, let me recast:

Wait, 225^2 = (225)*(225), so:

DP = (225 *225)/(22*325) = (225/325)*(225/22). Wait, maybe better to factor:

225 = 15² = 25*9

325 =25*13

Thus DP = (25*9 / (25*13)) * (225/22) ?

Wait, perhaps step-by-step:

DP = (225 *225)/(22 *325 )

= (225/325)*(225/22)

Simplify 225/325 = 45/65 = 9/13 (divided numerator and denominator by 5)

So DP = (9/13)*(225/22) = (9*225)/(13*22)

225 divided by 22? Not sure, but compute numerator and denominator:

9*225 = 2025

13*22 =286

Thus DP = 2025/286.

Now

---------------

, since DA =325/22 and DP=2025/286, then AP is the distance from A to P along the line. Since the points are in the order D---A---P (since D is outside, and P is the other intersection), then DP = DA + AP. Wait, but direction matters. Let me think again.

Power of a point formula says DA * DP = DB², but the

---------------

 formula is actually:

If a line through D intersects the circle at A and P, then DA * DP = power of D. But in terms of signed lengths, depending on the direction.

However, since D is outside, and A is one point, P is the other, then the power is DA * DP = DB², where DA and DP are lengths from D to A and D to P. Since P is further away, DP > DA, so AP = DP - DA.

Therefore, AP = DP - DA = (2025/286) - (325/22). Let's compute this.

Convert 325/22 to denominator 286:

22 *13 =286, so multiply numerator and denominator by 13: 325*13 /286

325*13: 300*13=3900, 25*13=325 ⇒ total 4225.

So 325/22 =4225/286

Thus AP = 2025/286 -4225/286 = (2025 -4225)/286 = (-2200)/286.

Wait, this gives a negative value? That can't be. Hmm, so maybe my assumption of the order is wrong. Maybe AP = DA - DP?

Wait, if D is outside, and the points are D---P---A, then DP = DA + AP? Wait, confusion

---------------

 arises here. Let me think carefully.

Power of a Point formula states that for a point D outside the circle, and a secant DAP where A and P are points of intersection with the circle, then DA * DP = power. Here, the points on the line are D, then going towards the circle, first hits A, then goes through to P. Wait no, actually, if D is outside, the line would pass through D, then enter the circle at P, exit at A, so the order is D---P---A. Wait, but in our case, A is already on the circle, so if we draw line DA, starting at D, going through A, then exiting the circle again at P? That would mean that A is the first intersection point, so the order is D---A---P. Therefore

---------------

, the distance from D to P is DA + AP. So DP = DA + AP ⇒ AP = DP - DA.

But in our calculation, DP =2025/286 ≈7.08, DA=325/22≈14.77. So DP - DA would be negative. Which is impossible. So that

---------------

 suggests an error in calculation.

Hmm, so my mistake must be in the calculation of DP or DA?

Let me check DA again. DA squared was computed as (25/6)^2 + (125√14 /33)^2, then simplified

---------------

 to (325/22)^2. Let me verify that step again.

Earlier steps:

First term: (25/6)^2 = 625/36

Second term: (125√14 /33)^2 = (125^2 *14)/33^2 = (15625 *14)/1089 = 218,750 /1089

Then I combined

---------------

 these as DA² = 625/36 + 218750/1089.

Then I factored out 25², which is 625, so:

625/36 + (625* (5^2 *14))/33^2 = 625 [1/36 + (25*14)/33²]

Wait, 125 is 25*5, so 125^2 is 25²*5², so yes

---------------

. So that term becomes 25² *5² *14 /33².

So inside the bracket:

[1/36 + (25*14*5²)/33² ]? Wait, no, 

---------------

5² is 25, so 25*14*25? Wait, no, sorry, the second term is (5² *14)/ (33²) multiplied by 25²?

Wait, let

---------------

 me re-express the second term:

Original second term is (125√14 /33)^2 = ( (25*5)√14 /33 )^2 = (25)^2*(5)^2*(14)/ (33)^2. So yes, so 

---------------

25²*(25*14)/33². Wait, 5² is 25, so 5²*14 =25*14. Therefore, the second term is 25²*(25*14)/33². So:

DA² = 25² [ 1/36 + (25*14)/33² ]

Wait, so in my previous step, I think I made

---------------

 a mistake here. Let me recast:

Wait, the first term was (25/6)^2 =25² /6², so factoring 25², we have:

DA² =25² [ (1/6²) + (25*14)/33² ]

Ah, so the second term inside the brackets is (25*14)/33², not (5²*14)/33². So my mistake was here.

Therefore, the bracket term is:

1/36 + (25*14)/(33²)

Compute that:

First term:1/36 ≈0.0277778

Second term:25*14=350; 33²=1089 ⇒ 350/1089≈0.3214

Total ≈0.0277778 +0.3214≈0.3492

But let me compute exactly:

Convert to common denominator 36*1089=39204.

1/36 = 1089/39204

350/1089 = (350 *36)/39204 = 12600/39204

Total numerator: 1089 +12600 =13689

Thus 13689 /39204. Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 9: 1521/4356

Divide by 3 again: 507 /1452

Again by 3: 169 /484. Wait, same as before? Wait, 13689 ÷9=1521, 39204 ÷9=4356.

1521 ÷3=507, 4356 ÷3=1452

507 ÷3=169, 1452 ÷3=484. So yes, same result. 169/484.

So then DA² =25²*(169/484)= (25*13 /22)^2, since 169=13², 484=22². So 25*13=325, so DA=325/22. So that part was correct.

Hmm, then where

---------------

 is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the power of a point formula was misapplied.

Power of a point D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC² = DA * DP.

But the formula is that for a point outside the circle, the power is equal to the product of the lengths from the point to the two intersections. So if the line through D intersects the circle at A and P, then DA * DP = power. But the key is that DA and DP are signed lengths if we consider direction, but in terms of absolute values, it's the product of the distances from D to each intersection point. So if the two points are A and P, then DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P, so DA * DP = DB².

But in this case, since A is between D and P, then DP = DA + AP. So DA*(DA + AP) = DB². Therefore, AP = (DB² / DA ) - DA.

So

---------------

 AP = ( (225/22)^2 / (325/22) ) - (325/22 )

Compute that:

First term: (225/22)^2 divided by (325/22) = (225^2 /22²) * (22/325 ) = (225²)/(22*325 )

Then subtract 325/22:

AP = [225²/(22*325) ] - 325/22 = [225² - 325² ] / (22*325 )

Wait, no, common denominator:

Wait, let me compute step by step:

Let me write both terms over the same denominator:

First term: (225²)/(22*325 )

Second term: (325/22) = (325 *325)/(22*325 )

Thus,

AP = [225² - (325)^2 ] / (22*325 )

Wait, but that would be:

Wait, actually,

Wait, AP = (225²)/(22*325) - 325/22 = [225² - 325² ] / (22*325 )

Wait, but

---------------

 that would be:

Wait, no, the second term is (325/22)*(325/325) to get denominator 22*325, so:

= [225² - (325)^2 ] / (22*325 )

But 225² -325² = (225 -325)(225 +325) = (-100)(550) = -55,000

Thus AP = -55000/(22*325)

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Factor numerator: -55000 = -55*1000 = -5*11*1000

Denominator: 22*325 =22*(5*65) =22*5*5*13= 2*11 *5²*13

So,

-55000/(22*325)= -55000/(7150)= Simpl

---------------

ify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 10: -5500/715

Divide by 5: -1100/143

Wait 7150 divided by 10 is 715, then divided by 5 is 143.

5500 divided by 10 is 550, divided by 5 is 110.

So -1100/143? Wait, 5500/10=550, 550/5=110. 715/5=143.

Wait, so -5500/715 = - (5500 ÷ 5)/ (715 ÷5)= -1100/143.

Wait, but 1100 divided by 143: let me see if they have common factors. 143 is 11*13, 1100 divided by 11 is 100, so 1100=11*100, 143=11*13.

Thus, -1100/143 = - (11*100)/(11*13) = -100/13.

Thus AP= -100/13. Wait, negative? That can’t be.

Hmm, so this

---------------

 suggests AP is negative, which is impossible. So clearly, there is an error in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the formula is DA * DP = power, but DP is the length from D to P, so if P is on the other side, then DA

---------------

 is in one direction and DP in the other?

Alternatively, maybe I have the direction wrong. Let me consider coordinates.

Coordinates of D: (9/2, -27√14/11 )

Coordinates of A: (26/3, 4√14/3 )

Coordinates of P: since it's another intersection point, perhaps

---------------

 it's on the other side, so that DP is actually shorter than DA? Wait, but that contradicts the power formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the param

---------------

etrization earlier?

Alternatively, perhaps the tangent lines were computed incorrectly?

Let me double-check the coordinates of point D. Earlier, we found D at (9/2, -27√14/11 ). Let me verify that.

The tangent at B has equation y = (6√14 /11)(x -9 )

The tangent at C has equation y= (-6√14 /11)x

Setting them equal:

(6√14 /11)(x -9 ) = (-6√14 /11)x

Multiply both sides by 11/(6√14):

(x -9 ) = -x

Thus 2x =9 ⇒x=9/2, then y= (-6√14 /11)(9/2)= -27√14/11. Yes, that's correct.

So coordinates of D are correct.

Distance DA was calculated as 325/22 ≈14.77, and DB squared is (225/22)^2 ≈ (10.227)^2 ≈104.6, but DA*DP should equal DB squared, so DP≈104.6 /14.77≈7.08, which is less than DA. So this suggests that P is between D and A, so AP = DA - DP ≈14.77 -7.08≈7.69. But according to the algebra, we had AP= -100/13≈-7.69, so the negative sign indicates direction, but the magnitude is 100/13.

Therefore, perhaps AP=100/13, so the answer would be 100+13=113.

Wait, but let me see:

If DA * DP = DB²,

then DP = DB² / DA = (225/22)^2 / (325/22) = (225² /22²) * (22/325 ) =225²/(22*325 )

Which

---------------

 is (225*225)/(22*325)= (225/325)*(225/22)= (45/65)*(225/22)= (9/13)*(225/22)= (2025)/286.

So DP=2025/286≈7.08.

Then, since DP

---------------

 is the distance from D to P, and DA is distance from D to A, which is 325/22≈14.77, then if P is between D and A, then AP= DA - DP≈14.77-7.08≈7.69, which is 100/13≈7.692.

Indeed, 2025/286 - 325/22 = (2025 - (325*13))/286 since

---------------

 22*13=286.

Wait, 325*13= 4225, so 2025-4225= -2200. So -2200/286= -1100/143= -100/13. So that negative value is the algebraic difference, but geometrically, the length is positive, so AP= |DP - DA|= | -100/13 | =100/13.

Therefore, AP=100/13. Thus m=100, n=13, which are coprime. So m +n=113.

Therefore, the answer is 113. I think that's it.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{113}


To solve the problem, we need to find the length of \(AP\) in triangle \(ABC\) inscribed in circle \(\omega\). The tangents to \(\omega\) at \(B\) and \(C\) intersect at point \(D\), and \(\overline{AD}\) intersects \(\omega\) again at \(P\). The sides of the triangle are given as \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\).

1. **Power of a Point**:
   - The power of point \(D\) with respect to \(\omega\) is equal to the square of the tangent lengths from \(D\) to \(\omega\). Since \(DB = DC\), we have \(DB^2 = DC^2\).
   - Using the power of point \(D\), we know \(DB^2 = DP \cdot DA\), where \(DP\) and \(DA\) are the distances from \(D\) to \(P\) and \(A\) respectively.

2. **Coordinates and Distances**:
   - Coordinates of \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are set with \(C\) at the origin \((0,0)\), \(B\) at \((9,0)\), and \(A\) calculated using the given side lengths.
   - Coordinates of \(A\) are found to be \(\left(\frac{26}{3}, \frac{4\sqrt{14}}{3}\right)\).
   - The coordinates of \(D\) are determined by solving the equations of the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\), resulting in \(D = \left(\frac{9}{2}, -\frac{27\sqrt{14}}{11}\right)\).

3. **Distance Calculations**:
   - Distance \(DB\) is calculated as \(\frac{225}{22}\).
   - Distance \(DA\) is calculated as \(\frac{325}{22}\).

4. **Applying Power of a Point**:
   - Using the power of point \(D\), we have \(DB^2 = DP \cdot DA\).
   - Solving for \(DP\), we get \(DP = \frac{2025}{286}\).
   - The length \(AP\) is found by subtracting \(DA\) from \(DP\) (considering the geometric configuration), resulting in \(AP = \frac{100}{13}\).

5. **Final Answer**:
   - The fraction \(\frac{100}{13}\) simplifies to \(m = 100\) and \(n = 13\), giving \(m + n = 113\).
