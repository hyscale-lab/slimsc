Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the smallest prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n where p² divides n⁴ + 1. Then, once we find that prime p, we need to find the smallest positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Alright, let's start with the first part: finding the smallest prime p.

First, I need to recall that n⁴ + 1 being divisible by p² means that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². That implies that n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p² because if we square both sides, (n⁴)² ≡ (-1)² mod p², so n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p². Therefore, the order of n modulo p² must divide 8. But since n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p², the order can't be 4 or 2 because if the order was 4, then n⁴ would be congruent to 1 mod p², which contradicts n⁴ ≡ -1. Similarly, order 2 would mean n² ≡ 1 mod p², but then n⁴ would be 1 again. So the order must be exactly 8. Therefore, 8 must divide the order of the multiplicative group modulo p². 

The multiplicative group modulo p² has order p(p-1). So the multiplicative group mod p² is cyclic of order p(p-1). Therefore, for there to exist an element of order 8, 8 must divide p(p-1). Since p is prime, p is either 2 or an odd prime. Let's first consider p=2. 

If p=2, then the multiplicative group mod 4 (since p² is 4 here) has order φ(4)=2. The multiplicative group mod 4 is {1,3}, and 3 mod 4 has order 2. So the order can't be 8, so p=2 is out. 

Next, p=3. Then p²=9. Let's see if there's an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 9. Let's compute n⁴ mod 9 for n from 1 to 8 (since mod 9 cycles every 9). 

Calculating n⁴ mod 9:

1⁴ = 1 mod9

2⁴ = 16 mod9 = 7

3⁴=81 mod9=0, but 0 can't be -1 mod9.

4⁴= (256) mod9. 256 divided by 9: 9*28=252, 256-252=4, so 4 mod9.

5⁴: 5^2=25≡7 mod9, so 5^4=(5^2)^2 ≡7²=49≡4 mod9.

6⁴: 6 is 0 mod3, so 6^4≡0 mod9, same as 3.

7⁴: 7≡-2 mod9, so (-2)^4=16≡7 mod9.

8⁴: 8≡-1 mod9, so (-1)^4=1 mod9.

So none of these give -1 mod9, which is 8 mod9. Since none of the residues mod9 give n⁴ ≡8 mod9, so p=3 is out.

Next prime p=5. p²=25. Let's check if there exists n with n⁴≡-1 mod25. So we need n⁴ ≡24 mod25. Let's compute n⁴ mod25 for n from 1 to 24.

Hmm, that's a bit tedious, but maybe we can find a pattern or use Euler's theorem. Since φ(25)=20, so n^20 ≡1 mod25 for n coprime to 25. Therefore, n^4 must have an order dividing 20, but since

---------------

 n^8 ≡1 mod25, so the order divides gcd(8,20)=4. Wait, but if n^4 ≡-1 mod25, then n^8 ≡1 mod25, so the order divides 8, but also divides 20. So gcd(8,20)=4, so the order must divide 4, but n^4 ≡-1 mod25 would imply that the order is 8, which contradicts that

---------------

 it divides 4. Wait, that can't be. Hmm, perhaps my mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, Euler's theorem says n^φ(25)=n^20 ≡1 mod25. If n^4 ≡-1 mod25, then n^8 ≡1 mod25, so the order of n modulo25 divides 8 and divides 20. Therefore, the order must divide gcd(8,20)=4. Therefore, n^4 ≡-1 mod25 would imply that n^4 ≡-1 mod25, so n^8≡1 mod25, but the order divides 4. If

---------------

 the order divides 4, then n^4 ≡1 mod25. But that's a contradiction. Therefore, there is no solution for n⁴≡-1 mod25. Therefore p=5 is also out.

Hmm, so p=5 can't work. Next prime p=7. Let's check p=7, so p²=49. We need n⁴ ≡-1 mod49. Let's see. Maybe

---------------

 try small n's?

Alternatively, let's see if 8 divides φ(49). φ(49)=42. Since 8 divides 42? 42 divided by 8 is 5.25. So 8 doesn't divide 42. Therefore, the multiplicative group mod49 has order 42, so the possible orders of elements must divide 42. So 8 doesn't divide 42, so there can't be an element of order 8. Therefore, there

---------------

 is no n with n⁴≡-1 mod49. Hence p=7 is also impossible.

Moving on to p=11. Let's check p=11. p squared is 121. So need n⁴ ≡-1 mod121. Let's see if φ(121)=110. So 8 divides 110? 110 divided by 8 is 13.75. So no. So again, the order of the multiplicative group is 110, so 8 doesn't divide 110, so no element of order 8. Hence, no solution.

Wait, so maybe I need primes where φ(p²) is divisible by 8? Because for an element of order 8 to exist in the multiplicative group mod p², the group order p(p-1) must be divisible by 8. So p(p-1) must be divisible by 8. Let's see. Let's think

---------------

 of primes where p(p-1) is divisible by 8. Since p is prime, either p is 2, but we saw p=2 can't work. For odd primes, p is odd, so p-1 is even. So p-1 must be divisible by 8, or p-1 divisible by 4 and p divisible by 2, but p is odd. So for p odd, p-1 must be divisible by 8, or p-1 divisible by 4 and p divisible by 2, but p can't be even except 2. So to

---------------

 have p(p-1) divisible by 8, since p is odd, p-1 must be divisible by 8. Therefore, p ≡1 mod8.

Therefore primes p≡1 mod8. The smallest primes congruent to 1 mod8 are 17, 41, 73, etc. Wait, 17 is the first prime after 2,3,5,7,11,13. 17 mod8 is 1, yes. So 17 is the first prime where p≡1 mod8, so p(p-1)=17×16, which is 272, which is divisible by 8. Therefore, the multiplicative group mod 17² has an element of order 8. So maybe 17 is the prime we are looking for? Let's check.

Wait, but let's check primes between 7 and 17. Wait, 13 is next. Let's check p=13. p=13, p squared is 169. φ(169)=13×12=156. 156 divided by 8 is 19.5, so not divisible. So 8 doesn't divide 156. Therefore, the

---------------

 multiplicative group mod169 has order 156, so 8 doesn't divide it, so no element of order8, so no solution here either. So next prime is 17.

So p=17. Let me check if there exists an n such that n⁴ ≡-1 mod17²=289. Hmm, how

---------------

 to check that?

Alternatively, perhaps first check modulo 17 first. Let me see if there's a solution modulo17. If

---------------

 there is, then perhaps we can lift it to modulo17² using Hensel's lemma?

First, check if n⁴ ≡-1 mod17 has solutions. Let's compute n⁴ mod17 for n from 1 to 16.

Alternatively, since 17 is prime, the multiplicative group mod17 has order 16. So we can look

---------------

 for elements of order 8, since n^8 ≡1 mod17, so n⁴ ≡-1 mod17 would require that the order is 8. Since 8 divides 16, that's possible.

Therefore, elements of order 8 exist mod17, so solutions to n⁴≡-1 mod17 exist. Let's find one. Let me try small numbers:

Compute 2⁴=16 mod17. 16 is -1 mod17. Wait, 2⁴ is 16, which is -1 mod17. Oh! So n=2 gives 2⁴ =16≡-1 mod17. So indeed, n=2 mod17 is a solution. So there is a solution mod17. Now, can we lift this to mod17²?

Using Hensel's lemma. Let me recall that Hensel's lemma says that if f(n) ≡0 mod p and f'(n) not ≡0 mod p, then there is a unique lift mod p². Here f(n)=n⁴+1. The derivative f'(n)=4n³. At n=2 mod17, f'(2)=4*(8)=32≡32-17=15 mod17. 15≠0 mod17. Therefore, Hensel's lemma applies, so there is a unique solution mod17² congruent to 2 mod17. Therefore, there exists an m≡2 mod17 such that m⁴≡-1 mod17². Therefore, p=17 is the smallest prime where such an n exists. 

Wait, but before jumping to conclusion, let's check primes between 17 and, like, 7? Wait, no

---------------

, we already checked primes 2,3,5,7,11,13 and they didn't work. So 17 is the next. So p=17 is the smallest prime.

Therefore, now the second part: find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by 17²=289. Since we know that m ≡2 mod17, we can write m=17k+2, and find the smallest k≥0 such that (17k+2)^4 +1 ≡0 mod289.

Let me compute (17k +2)^4 mod289. Since 17k is a multiple of17, let's expand using the binomial theorem:

(17k +2)^4 = (2)^4 + 4*(2)^3*(17k) + 6*(2)^2*(17k)^2 + 4*(2)*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.

But since we're mod289, which is 17², terms with (17k)^2 or higher will be 0 mod289. Because (17k)^2=289k²≡0 mod289. Similarly higher terms. Therefore:

(17k +2)^4 ≡2^4 +4*(2)^3*(17k) mod289

Compute each term:

2^4=16.

4*(2)^3*(17k)=4*8*17k = 32*17k. 32*17= 544. So 544k.

Therefore, (17k +2)^4 ≡16 +544k mod289.

We need this to be ≡-1 mod289. So:

16 +544k ≡ -1 mod289

Thus, 544k ≡ -17 mod289.

Simplify 544 mod289. Since 289*1=289, 544-289=255. 255 is still larger than 289? Wait 544 divided by 289 is 1 with a remainder of 255. So 544 ≡255 mod289. So:

255k ≡ -17 mod289.

We can write this as 255k ≡272 mod289 (since -17 mod289 is 272).

Now, we need to solve 255k ≡272 mod289.

First, let's compute GCD(255,289). 289 is 17², and 255=17×15. So GCD(255,289)=17. Since 17 divides 272 (272/17=16). Therefore, the equation has solutions.

Divide both sides by 17:

(255/17)k ≡ (272/17) mod (289/17)

Which is 15k ≡16 mod17.

So 15k ≡16 mod17.

We need to find k mod17. Let's compute the inverse of 15 mod17.

15 and 17 are coprime. 15 mod17 is 15. Find x such that 15x ≡1 mod17.

15*1=15≡-2 mod17. 15* (-8)= -120≡-120+17*7= -120+119= -1 mod17. So 15*(-8)≡-1 mod17. Therefore, 15*(-8*-1)=15*8≡1 mod17. Wait, let's do step by step.

Let me try 15x ≡1 mod17. Trying x=7: 15*7=105 mod17. 17*6=102, so 105-102=3 mod17. Not 1. x=13: 15*13=195. 17*11=187. 195-187=8 mod17. Hmm. x=15: 15*15=225. 225 mod17: 17*13=221, so 225-221=4 mod17. Not. x= 15 inverse? Maybe 

---------------

8? 15*8=120. 120 mod17: 17*7=119, so 1. 120-119=1. Yes! 15*8≡1 mod17. So inverse is 8.

Therefore, multiply both sides by 8:

k≡16*8 mod17.

16*8=128. 128 mod17: 17*7=119, 128-119=9 mod17. So k≡9 mod17. Therefore, the solutions are k=17t +9 for integer t≥0.

We need the smallest positive k such that m=17k+2 is positive. Since k must be at least 0. Let's take t=0, so k=9. Then m=17*9 +2=153+2=155. Let's check if this works.

Wait, let me verify m=155:

Compute 155^4 +1 mod289. Since 155 mod17 is 155 -17*9=155-153=2 mod17, which is correct. So we

---------------

 need to check if (155)^4 ≡-1 mod289.

But let's compute (17*9 +2)^4 mod289. Wait, but

---------------

 when we expanded earlier, we had:

(17k+2)^4 ≡16 +544k mod289.

With k=9, so 544*9 = 4896. 4896 mod289: Let's compute how many times 289 goes into 4896.

289*16=4624. 4896-4624=272. So 544*9 mod289=272 mod289.

Then total expression:16 +272=288≡-1 mod289. Perfect, that works. So m=155 is a solution. 

But wait, is there a smaller k? Since k≡9 mod17, so the minimal k is 9, which gives m=155. But perhaps k can be negative? Since k is non-negative (as m is positive integer). So k=9 is the smallest possible. Therefore, m=155 is the minimal m for p=17. 

Wait, but let me check if there is a smaller m. Maybe m

---------------

=2 mod17, but smaller than 155. Let's see. The numbers congruent to 2 mod17 less than 155 would be 2, 19, 36, 53, 70, 87, 104, 121, 138, 155. So 155 is the tenth term. So the first one is 2, but m=2 gives 2^4 +1=17, which is divisible by 17 but not 17². Similarly, m=19: let's compute 19^4 +1 mod289. 

Compute 19 mod17 is 2, so similar to before, but 19 is 2 mod17, but k=1 (since m=17*1 +2=19). So plugging k=1 into the equation:

16 +544*1=16 +544=560 mod289. 560-289=271. 271 mod289. 271 is not -1 mod289. So 19^4 +1 ≡271 mod289≠0. Similarly, m

---------------

=36 is 17*2+2=36. Let's check k=2: 544*2=1088 mod289. 289*3=867, 1088-867=221. 16+221=237 mod289≠-1. So not. Similarly k=3: 544*3=1632 mod289. 289*5=1445, 1632-1445=187. 16+187=203 mod289≠-1. Continuing:



---------------

k=4: 544*4=2176 mod289. 289*7=2023, 2176-2023=153. 16+153=169 mod289≠-1.

k=5: 544*5=2720 mod289. 289*9=2601. 2720-2601=119. 16+119=135 mod289≠-1.

k=6: 544*6=3264 mod289. 289*11=3179. 3264-3179=85. 16+85=101 mod289.

k=7: 544*7=3808 mod289. 289*13=3757. 3808-3757=51. 16+51=67 mod289.

k=8: 544*8=4352 mod289. 289*15=4335. 4352-4335=17. 16+17=33 mod289.

k=9: as before, gives 288≡-1 mod289. So yes, k=9 is the first one that works. Therefore m=155 is indeed the minimal m. 

Wait, but let me check if there is a smaller prime p than 17? Let me check p= 17 is the first prime where p≡1 mod8, but maybe there's another prime where p² divides n⁴ +1 without p≡1 mod8? Wait, perhaps p= something else?

Wait, earlier primes like p= 7, 13, etc. didn't work because φ(p²) wasn't divisible by 8. So unless there is a prime where p² divides n⁴+1 even when the multiplicative group doesn't have an element of order8? Hmm, maybe if

---------------

 n is 0 mod p? But n⁴ +1 ≡1 mod p², so that can't be. So n must not be 0 mod p, so n is invertible mod p². Therefore, the multip

---------------

licative group must have an element of order8. Therefore, the order of the group must be divisible by8, so p(p-1) divisible by8. For odd primes, p is odd, so p-1 must be divisible by8. So primes p≡1 mod8 are the only candidates. Therefore, 17 is indeed the smallest such prime. So 

---------------

17 is correct. So m=155 is the minimal m.

Wait, but let me check p= 257? Wait, no, 17 is smaller. So I

---------------

 think that is correct. Therefore, the answer is 155. Wait but before finalizing, let me check with another method.

Alternatively, let me compute m=155^4 +1 divided by 289. Let's compute 155^4 mod289. But since 155=17*9 +2, so as before, when

---------------

 we expand, we had that it's -1 mod289, so 155^4 +1≡0 mod289. So that works. 



---------------

Alternatively, to confirm, perhaps compute m=155:

First compute 155 mod17²=289. 155 is less than 289, so compute

---------------

 155^4:

But that's a big number, but maybe compute step by step mod289.

Compute 155 mod289 is 155.

Compute 155^2: 155² = 24025. Now divide 24025 by289:

289*83 = 289*(80+3)=289*80=23120 +289*3=867 → total 23120+867=23987. 

24025-23987=38. So 155²≡38 mod289.

Then 155^4=(155²)^2≡38² mod289. 38²=1444. 1444 divided by289: 289*4=1156, 1444-1156=288. 288 mod289 is -1. Therefore 155^4≡-1 mod289. Thus, 155^4 +1≡0 mod289. Perfect. So that's correct.

Therefore, the minimal prime is 17, and minimal m is 155. Therefore, the answer is 155. So the final answer is \boxed{155}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{155}


To find the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) where \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \), we need \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \). This requires the order of \( n \) modulo \( p^2 \) to be 8, which implies \( p(p-1) \) must be divisible by 8. The smallest prime \( p \) satisfying this is \( p = 17 \), as \( 17 \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \).

Next, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 = 289 \). We know \( n = 2 \) is a solution modulo 17, so we use Hensel's lemma to lift this solution to modulo \( 289 \).

Writing \( m = 17k + 2 \), we expand \( (17k + 2)^4 \) modulo 289. After simplifying, we find:
\[
(17k + 2)^4 \equiv 16 + 544k \pmod{289}
\]
We need this to be congruent to \(-1 \pmod{289}\):
\[
16 + 544k \equiv -1 \pmod{289}
\]
Solving \( 544k \equiv -17 \pmod{289} \), we find \( k \equiv 9 \pmod{17} \). The smallest \( k \) is 9, giving \( m = 17 \times 9 + 2 = 155 \).

Verification shows \( 155^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{289} \), confirming the solution. Thus, the least positive integer \( m \) is \(\boxed{155}\).<|im_end|>
