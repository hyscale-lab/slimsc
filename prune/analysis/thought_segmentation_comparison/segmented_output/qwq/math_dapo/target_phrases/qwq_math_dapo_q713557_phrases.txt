Okay, so I need to figure out how many ways 345 can be written as the sum of an increasing sequence of two or more consecutive positive integers. Hmm, I remember there's a formula or method for this kind of problem. Let me think.

First, I recall that any sequence of consecutive integers can be expressed as a starting number 'a' and then a number of terms 'n', so the sequence is a, a+1, a+2, ..., a+(n-1). The sum of this sequence is equal to the number of terms multiplied by the average of the first and last term. So the sum S would be:

S = n*(2a + n - 1)/2

In this case, S is 345. So plugging that in, we have:

345 = n*(2a + n - 1)/2

Multiplying both sides by 2 gives:

690 = n*(2a + n - 1)

So the equation becomes 2a + n - 1 = 690/n. Since 'a' has to be a positive integer, the right-hand side must also be an integer. That means that n must be a divisor of 690. But also, since a has to be positive, we can set up inequalities to find possible values of n.

Let me rearrange the equation to solve for 'a':

2a = (690/n) - n + 1

So,

a = [ (690/n) - n + 1 ] / 2

Since a must be a positive integer, the expression (690/n - n + 1) must be even and positive. Therefore, two conditions must be satisfied:

1. (690/n - n + 1) must be even.
2. (690/n - n + 1) must be positive, so that a is positive.

So the strategy is to find all divisors n of 690 (since n must divide 690), then check for each such n whether (690/n - n + 1) is even and positive. Each valid n corresponds to a valid sequence.

First, let me list all the divisors of 690. To do this, I need to factorize 690 first.

690. Let's factor it:

690 divided by 2 is 345

345 divided by 5 is 69

69 divided by 3 is 23

23 is a prime number. So prime factors are 2 × 3 × 5 × 23.

Therefore, the number of divisors is (1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 16 divisors. Let me list them all.

The exponents for each prime factor are 1 for 2, 1 for 3, 1 for 5, and 1 for 23. So the divisors are all combinations of these primes:

Starting with 2^0, 2^1

3^0, 3^1

5^0, 5^1

23^0, 23^1

So all divisors can be generated by multiplying these:

1 (all exponents 0)

2, 3, 5, 23

2×3=6, 2×5=10, 2×23=46, 3×5=15, 3×23=69, 5×23=115

2×3×5=30, 2×3×23=138, 2×5×23=230, 3×5×23=345

And the last one is 2×3×5×23=690

So the list of divisors is:

1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 23, 30, 46, 69, 115, 138, 230, 345, 690

These are all 16 divisors. Now, n can be any of these divisors, but n has to be at least 2 because the problem specifies "two or more consecutive integers". So n can be 2,3,5,... up to 690.

But we need to check for each n (divisor of 690, n ≥2) whether (690/n - n +1) is even and positive.

Let me go through each divisor:

Starting with n=2:

Check (690/2 -2 +1) = 345 -2 +1 = 344. 344 is even. So a = 344/2 = 172. Since a must be positive, yes, 172 is positive. So this is valid. So n=2 is a valid number of terms.

Next n=3:

690/3 = 230. So 230 -3 +1 = 228. 228 is even. a=228/2=114. Positive. Valid.

n=5:

690/5 = 138. 138 -5 +1=134. 134 is even. a=67. Valid.

n=6:

690/6=115. 115 -6 +1=110. 110 even. a=55. Valid.

n=10:

690/10=69. 69 -10 +1=60. 60 even. a=30. Valid.

n=15:

690/15=46. 46 -15 +1=32. 32 even. a=16. Valid.

n=23:

690/23=30. 30 -23 +1=8. 8 even. a=4. Valid.

n=30:

690/30=23. 23 -30 +1= -6. Hmm, negative. Since a must be positive, this would give a negative a, which is invalid. So discard n=30.



---------------

Wait, hold on. Let me check that again. For n=30, (690/30)=23. So 23 -30 +1 = (23 +1) -30 = 24 -30 = -6. So yes, negative. So that's invalid. So n=30 is not acceptable.

Moving on.

n=46:

690/46 = 15. So 15 -46 +1 = (15+1) -46 = 16-46 = -30. Negative. Invalid.

n=69:

690/69=10. 10 -69 +1 = (10+1) -69 = 11-69 = -58. Negative. Invalid.

n=115:

690/115=6. 6 -115 +1 = (6+1) -115=7-115=-108. Negative. Invalid.

n=138:

690/138=5. 5 -138 +1= (5+1) -138=6-138=-132. Negative. Invalid.

n=230:

690/230=3. 3 -230 +1= (3+1)-230=4-230=-226. Negative. Invalid.

n=345:

690/345=2. 2 -345 +1= (2+1)-345=3-345=-342. Negative. Invalid.

n=690:

690/690=1. 1 -690 +1= (1+1)-690=2-690=-688. Negative. Invalid.

So the divisors that worked (i.e., gave a positive a and even (690/n -n +1)) are n=2,3,5,6,10,15,23.



---------------

Wait, let me count again:

Starting from n=2 up:

n=2: valid

n=3: valid

n=5: valid

n=6: valid

n=10: valid

n=15: valid

n=23: valid

Then n=30 onwards were invalid. So that's 7 divisors. 

---------------

Wait, but let me check n=23 again. 23 gives a=4, so the sequence would be 4+5+...+26 (since 23 terms starting at 4: 4+5+...+26. Let me check that sum. The sum should be (23*(4 +26))/2 = 23*30/2 = 23*15=345. Correct.

Similarly, n=15 gives a=16. So 16 to 16+14=30. Sum is 15*(16+30)/2 =15*23=345. Correct.

Okay, so each of these n's gives a valid sequence. So the total number of ways is 7? 

---------------

Wait, let me check again.

Wait, let me list all the valid n's again:

2,3,5,6,10,15,23. That's 7 terms. Hmm, but maybe I missed some?



---------------

Wait, let's check n=1. Wait, but n has to be two or more, so n=1 is excluded.



---------------

Wait, let me go through all the divisors again step by step.

Divisors of 690 (excluding 1):

2,3,5,6,10,15,23,30,46,69,115,138,230,345,690.

So 15 divisors (since total 16, minus 1).

Now, for each of these 15:

n=2: valid

n=3: valid

n=5: valid

n=6: valid

n=10: valid

n=15: valid

n=23: valid

n=30: invalid (as above)

n=46: invalid

n=69: invalid

n=115: invalid

n=138: invalid

n=230: invalid

n=345: invalid

n=690: invalid

So total valid n's: 7. So the answer would be 7? 

---------------

Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that some n's might give the same sequence? Or maybe I missed a divisor?



---------------

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation for n=15. Let me check that again.

n=15:

a = (690/15 -15 +1)/2 = (46 -15 +1)/2 = (32)/2 =16. So that's correct. So 15 terms starting at 16: sum is indeed 345.



---------------

Wait, what about n=7? Wait, 7 is not a divisor of 690, so it can't be considered. Hmm.



---------------

Wait another thought: perhaps the formula is correct, but maybe I missed some divisors?

Wait 690 factors are 2×3×5×23, so all divisors are combinations as listed. So I don't think there are any missing. So the answer should be 7?

But let me check with another approach. 

---------------

Another way to think about the problem is that the number of ways to express a number as the sum of consecutive integers is equal to the number of odd divisors of the number greater than 1. 

---------------

Wait, but is that true?

Wait, actually, I think the formula is a bit different. Let me recall. The number of ways to express a number N as sum of consecutive positive integers is equal to the number of odd factors of N excluding 1, but maybe adjusted for the number of terms. Hmm, maybe not exactly. Let me think again.



---------------

Alternatively, the method we used is correct, so perhaps 7 is the answer. Let me see another example to verify.

Take a smaller number, like 9. How many ways? Let's see:

9 can be written as 4+5, or 2+3+4, or just 9 (but that's only one term, which is excluded). So two ways. Let's apply the method here.

For N=9, equation would be n*(2a +n-1)/2 =9, so 2a +n -1 = 18/n.

Divisors of 18 (since 2*9=18) are 1,2,3,6,9,18.

So n must be a divisor of 18, and n>=2.

Testing n=2:

(18/2 -2 +1)=9 -2 +1=8, which is even. a=4. So 4+5=9. Valid.

n=3:

18/3=6. 6 -3 +1=4, even. a=2. 2+3+4=9. Valid.

n=6:

18/6=3. 3 -6 +1=-2. Negative, so invalid.

n=9:

18/9=2. 2 -9 +1=-6. Negative.

n=18:

18/18=1. 1 -18 +1=-16. Negative.

Thus total valid n's are 2 and 3. So two ways, which matches the actual count. So the method works here.



---------------

Another example: 15. Let's see.

15 can be written as:

7+8, 4+5+6, 1+2+3+4+5, so three ways.

Using the method:

N=15, so 2a +n -1 = 30/n.

Divisors of 30 (since 2*15=30):

Divisors are 1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30.

n must be ≥2:

n=2:

30/2=15. 15-2+1=14. Even. a=7. 7+8=15. Valid.

n=3:

30/3=10. 10-3+1=8. Even. a=4. 4+5+6=15. Valid.

n=5:

30/5=6. 6-5+1=2. Even. a=1. 1+2+3+4+5=15. Valid.

n=6:

30/6=5. 5-6+1=0. Hmm, zero. Then a=0, but a must be positive. So invalid.



---------------

Wait, zero? So (0+1)/2? Wait, the formula would give a=0, which is invalid since we need positive integers. So n=6 is invalid here.

n=10:

30/10=3. 3-10+1= -6. Negative. Invalid.

n=15:

30/15=2. 2-15+1= -12. Invalid.

n=30: same as above.

So valid n's are 2,3,5. That's three, which matches. So the method works here.

So returning to our problem, 345. The method gives 7 ways, so perhaps that is the correct answer. 

---------------

Wait, let me recount the valid n's again.

List of valid n's were: 2,3,5,6,10,15,23. That's seven numbers. Let me check each:

n=2:

a=(690/2 -2 +1)/2 = (345 -1)/2 = 344/2=172. So numbers 172 and 173. 172+173=345. Correct.

n=3:

a=(230 -3 +1)/2 = (228)/2=114. 114+115+116= 114+115=229, +116=345. Correct.

n=5:

a=(138 -5 +1)/2 =134/2=67. 67+68+69+70+71. Let's compute: 67+71=138, 68+70=138, and 69 in the middle. So 138+138+69= 345. Correct.

n=6:

a=(115 -6 +1)/2 =110/2=55. 55+56+57+58+59+60. Let's compute: 55+60=115, 56+59=115, 57+58=115. So 115*3=345. Correct.

n=10:

a=(69 -10 +1)/2=60/2=30. So 30 to 39. The sum is 10*(30+39)/2=10*69/2=5*69=345. Correct.

n=15:

a=(46 -15 +1)/2=32/2=16. 16 to 30 (15 terms). Sum is 15*(16+30)/2 =15*23=345. Correct.

n=23:

a=(30 -23 +1)/2=8/2=4. 4 to 26 (23 terms). Sum is 23*(4+26)/2=23*15=345. Correct.

All these check out, so seven valid sequences. Therefore, the answer should be 7. 

---------------

But wait, just to make sure I didn't miss any divisors. Let me check again the list of divisors:

Divisors of 690 (excluding 1):

2,3,5,6,10,15,23,30,46,69,115,138,230,345,690.

Total of 15. We checked each and found 7 valid. So 7 is the answer.



---------------

Wait, but I recall sometimes when the number is odd, there might be different counts. Wait 345 is odd. Let me think of another approach. The formula says that the number of ways is equal to the number of odd divisors of N that are not 1 and also satisfy some conditions. 

---------------

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of divisors?

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is indeed 7. Let me see another way. Since the formula we used worked for the smaller numbers, so unless I made a mistake in divisor listing, it should be correct.



---------------

Wait, let me check n=1. If n=1, then a would have to be 345. But the problem requires two or more terms, so n=1 is excluded. So yes, all valid n's are accounted for.

Therefore, I think the answer is 7. Hmm. Let me check once again if there are any other divisors I might have overlooked. 

---------------

Wait, 690 divided by 4 is 172.5, so 4 isn't a divisor. 7? 690 divided by 7 is about 98.57, not integer. 8? 690/8 is 86.25, nope. 9? 690/9=76.666, no. 12? 690/12=57.5, no. So none of these are divisors. So the list is correct. So the answer is 7.

**Final Answer**
Answer: 7


To determine the number of ways 345 can be written as the sum of an increasing sequence of two or more consecutive positive integers, we start with the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence. For a sequence starting at \(a\) with \(n\) terms, the sum is given by:

\[
S = \frac{n}{2} \times [2a + (n - 1)]
\]

Setting \(S = 345\), we have:

\[
345 = \frac{n}{2} \times (2a + n - 1)
\]

Multiplying both sides by 2:

\[
690 = n(2a + n - 1)
\]

Rearranging to solve for \(a\):

\[
2a = \frac{690}{n} - n + 1 \implies a = \frac{\frac{690}{n} - n + 1}{2}
\]

For \(a\) to be a positive integer, \(\frac{690}{n} - n + 1\) must be even and positive. We need to find all divisors \(n\) of 690 (since \(n\) must divide 690) that satisfy these conditions. The prime factorization of 690 is \(2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 23\), giving the divisors:

\[
1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 23, 30, 46, 69, 115, 138, 230, 345, 690
\]

Excluding 1 (since \(n \geq 2\)), we check each divisor:

- \(n = 2\): \(\frac{690}{2} - 2 + 1 = 344\) (even, positive) \(\implies a = 172\)
- \(n = 3\): \(\frac{690}{3} - 3 + 1 = 228\) (even, positive) \(\implies a = 114\)
- \(n = 5\): \(\frac{690}{5} - 5 + 1 = 134\) (even, positive) \(\implies a = 67\)
- \(n = 6\): \(\frac{690}{6} - 6 + 1 = 110\) (even, positive) \(\implies a = 55\)
- \(n = 10\): \(\frac{690}{10} - 10 + 1 = 60\) (even, positive) \(\implies a = 30\)
- \(n = 15\): \(\frac{690}{15} - 15 + 1 = 32\) (even, positive) \(\implies a = 16\)
- \(n = 23\): \(\frac{690}{23} - 23 + 1 = 8\) (even, positive) \(\implies a = 4\)
- \(n = 30, 46, 69, 115, 138, 230, 345, 690\) all result in negative values for \(\frac{690}{n} - n + 1\)

Thus, the valid values of \(n\) are 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 23, leading to 7 valid sequences.

\[
\boxed{7}
\]
