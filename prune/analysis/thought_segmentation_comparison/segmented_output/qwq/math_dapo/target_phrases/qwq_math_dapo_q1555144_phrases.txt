Okay, so I need to figure out the maximum value of t such that for any positive integer n, there exists a good collection of n triangles, each with perimeter greater than t. The triangles are all inscribed in a circle of radius 1, and no two triangles can share a common interior point. Hmm, this seems like a problem about packing triangles on a circle without overlapping and ensuring each has a large enough perimeter.

First, let me recall that the perimeter of a triangle inscribed in a circle depends on the lengths of its sides. Since the circle has radius 1, the circumference is 2π. But the perimeter of the triangle itself isn't directly related to the circumference of the circle, except that the triangle's vertices lie on the circle. 

I know that for a triangle inscribed in a circle (a cyclic triangle), the sides can be related to the central angles subtended by those sides. Let me think: if we have a triangle with central angles α, β, γ, then each side length can be expressed using the chord length formula. The chord length for an angle θ is 2r sin(θ/2). Since the radius r is 1, each side is 2 sin(θ/2). So the perimeter would be 2(sin(α/2) + sin(β/2) + sin(γ/2)). Since α + β + γ = 2π, maybe there's a way to maximize or find a lower bound for this sum?

But the problem isn't about maximizing the perimeter of a single triangle, but rather ensuring that for any n, we can have n triangles each with perimeter greater than t, without overlapping. So we need to find the maximum t such that no matter how large n is, we can still fit n triangles each with perimeter > t, without overlapping.

This seems like a covering problem, but in reverse. Instead of covering the circle with triangles, we're packing triangles such that they don't overlap, and each has a sufficiently large perimeter.

First, maybe I should figure out what's the minimal possible maximum perimeter? 

---------------

Wait, no. The question is to find the maximal t such that for any n, there exists a packing of n triangles each with perimeter > t. So the higher t is, the harder it is to satisfy for large n. The maximum t would be the supremum of all t where this is possible for any n.

So to find the maximum t, we need to find the minimal upper bound such that even as n grows, you can still have triangles with perimeter above that t. So maybe t is the limit as n approaches infinity of the minimal maximum perimeter of n triangles packed in the circle?



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to find an arrangement where triangles can be packed efficiently, each with perimeter just over some t, and as n increases, t can't be too large. So the maximum t would be the infimum over n of the minimal maximum perimeter needed for n triangles. 

---------------

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to think of specific configurations.

First, let me think about regular triangles. If all triangles are equilateral, inscribed in the circle. The side length of an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle of radius 1 is 2*sin(60°) = √3 ≈ 1.732. So each side is √3, so perimeter is 3√3 ≈ 5.196. But if we use equilateral triangles, how many can we fit without overlapping? Since each triangle takes up 120° of the circle? 

---------------

Wait, no, an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle has each central angle 120°, so each triangle would occupy 120° of the circumference? Hmm, actually, the vertices are spaced 120° apart. If we place multiple equilateral triangles, their vertices would need to be spaced in such a way that they don't overlap. But if you try to place two equilateral triangles, their vertices would interfere unless they're rotated appropriately.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe arrange triangles in a way that they are spaced out around the circle. For example, if you divide the circle into n equal arcs, each of angle 2π/n, and place a triangle on each arc? 

---------------

Wait, but a triangle needs three points. Maybe each triangle is formed by three consecutive points? If you have n points equally spaced around the circle, then each triangle could be formed by three consecutive points. But the perimeter of such triangles might get smaller as n increases because the arcs between the points are smaller.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe arrange the triangles so that each triangle uses three points spaced apart in such a way that their arcs are as large as possible. Hmm.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires considering that as n increases, the triangles must become smaller to fit more of them, so their perimeters would decrease. Therefore, the maximum t is the limit of the minimal perimeter as n approaches infinity. So to find the infimum of the perimeters as n grows, which would be the minimal t that you can guarantee for any n. So the maximum t is the greatest lower bound such that even with infinitely many triangles, you could have each with perimeter above t? 

---------------

Wait, but the problem states "for each positive integer n", so as n becomes large, you can still have n triangles each with perimeter greater than t. Therefore, t must be less than or equal to the infimum over n of the maximum minimal perimeter for n triangles.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the key is to find a configuration where each triangle can be made with a perimeter just above some t, and you can tile the circle with such triangles in a way that as n increases, you can still have each triangle's perimeter not go below t. Hmm, tricky.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe think of the problem in terms of the minimal perimeter that a triangle can have while being part of a packing with n triangles. Since we need this to hold for all n, the t must be less than the infimum over all n of the maximum minimal perimeter. 

---------------

Wait, perhaps I need to look for a lower bound on the perimeter of each triangle in any packing of n triangles, then take the supremum over those lower bounds as n increases.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the maximum t is the perimeter of an equilateral triangle, since that's the most symmetric and perhaps can be packed in some way. But if you have n triangles, each taking up 120 degrees, you can only have 3 triangles before overlapping. 

---------------

Wait, but maybe rotated?

Wait, perhaps the problem allows the triangles to be arranged in such a way that they don't overlap. For instance, if you have triangles that are all very "skinny", but arranged so their interiors don't overlap, but each still has a large perimeter. Hmm, but a skinny triangle might have a small perimeter. 

---------------

Wait, actually, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, if you have a triangle with two very long sides and one very short side, but inscribed in a circle, maybe? For example, if two vertices are close together on the circumference, and the third is diametrically opposite. Then the two sides from the distant vertex would be almost the diameter (length 2), and the side between the two close vertices would be small. The perimeter would then be approximately 2 + 2 + 0 = 4? Hmm, but maybe that's not the case.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the perimeter can be maximized when the triangle is equilateral, but if you need to fit many triangles, you can't have all of them equilateral because they would overlap. So you need a different configuration where triangles can be arranged without overlapping but still have a reasonably large perimeter.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps arranging the triangles such that each triangle is a very "flat" triangle, but arranged so they don't overlap. 

---------------

Wait, but flat triangles might have small perimeters. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to use triangles that are all inscribed in the circle but arranged in a way that their vertices are spaced out so they don't overlap. For example, if you divide the circle into n equal arcs, and place a triangle on every third arc or something. 

---------------

Wait, perhaps each triangle uses three non-consecutive points.

Alternatively, maybe the problem requires an application of some known theorem about packing triangles on a circle. But since I don't recall any specific theorem, I need to think through.

Let me consider the case when n is very large. For very large n, you need to have n triangles packed without overlapping, each with perimeter greater than t. So as n becomes large, each triangle must be small in some sense, but the perimeter can't be too small. So perhaps the minimal perimeter in such a packing approaches some limit as n increases. The question is asking for the maximum t such that this limit is at least t, so t would be that limit.

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimal possible upper limit on perimeter as n approaches infinity. So we need to find the infimum of the perimeters over all possible packings with n triangles, and then take the supremum of t such that this infimum is at least t for all n. Hmm, maybe I need to think of an asymptotic lower bound on the perimeter of each triangle when packing n triangles.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal perimeter is achieved when the triangles are arranged as regularly as possible. Suppose we divide the circle into n equal arcs, each of angle 2π/n, and then for each triangle, we take three consecutive points? 

---------------

Wait, but three consecutive points would form a triangle with very small sides if n is large.

Alternatively, maybe each triangle is formed by points spaced k arcs apart. Let me formalize this.

Suppose the circle is divided into m equally spaced points, where m is a multiple of 3, so m = 3n. Then each triangle can be formed by three points spaced n apart. 

---------------

Wait, but not sure.

Alternatively, if we have n triangles, each triangle could be associated with three points spaced at intervals. Let me think of an equidistant arrangement.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal packing is to have all triangles equally spaced around the circle, each rotated by some angle. For example, if we have n triangles, each rotated by 2π/n from the previous one. But how to ensure they don't overlap?



---------------

Alternatively, maybe arrange the triangles so that their vertices are placed at the vertices of a regular 3n-gon. Then each triangle is formed by every n-th vertex. 

---------------

Wait, but maybe overlapping occurs?

Alternatively, perhaps each triangle is inscribed such that their vertices are separated by angles of 2π/3, but rotated by different angles. But that might not prevent overlapping.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to use triangles with central angles that are as large as possible. The perimeter of a triangle is maximized when the triangle is equilateral, but for packing, we need to arrange triangles so that they don't overlap, so maybe each triangle must be "small" in some angular sense.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal perimeter occurs when the triangles are as "spread out" as possible. Let me consider the perimeter of a triangle inscribed in a circle with central angles α, β, γ. The perimeter P is 2(sin(α/2) + sin(β/2) + sin(γ/2)). Since α + β + γ = 2π, maybe we can find a lower bound for P given some constraints on the angles.

Suppose each triangle in the packing must have angles not too small, otherwise their arcs would be too close to others. 

---------------

Wait, but how do the angles relate to non-overlapping?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that each triangle must occupy a certain arc length on the circumference, and to prevent overlapping, these arcs must be spaced out.



---------------

Alternatively, think of each triangle as covering three points on the circle. To prevent overlapping interiors, the triangles must not have overlapping regions. The interiors are the regions inside the triangles, so two triangles can't have overlapping areas. This is more restrictive than just not having overlapping edges or vertices.

This seems complicated. Maybe an easier approach is to look for known results or similar problems. 

---------------

Wait, I recall that in some packing problems on a circle, the most efficient packing might involve regular polygons or equally spaced points.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the maximum t is 3*2*sin(π/3) = 3√3, but that's the equilateral triangle's perimeter, but obviously, you can't have multiple equilateral triangles without overlapping. Since an equilateral triangle takes up 120 degrees between each vertex. If you try to place another equilateral triangle, it would have to be rotated, but overlapping might occur.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the best way to arrange multiple triangles without overlapping is to have them all very small, but arranged so that their arcs don't overlap. 

---------------

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe the problem requires that each triangle is placed such that their arcs are separated by some angle, so their interiors don't intersect. If two triangles have an overlapping region, their interiors would intersect. To prevent that, their edges must not cross in a way that creates overlapping areas.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the triangles can be arranged as non-overlapping by placing them in different regions of the circle. For example, dividing the circle into n regions, each containing a triangle. If each region is an arc of 2π/n, then each triangle must fit within its own region? But a triangle needs three points, so maybe each region is a sector of angle 2π/n, and each triangle has all three vertices within a sector? But then the triangle would be very small, with a small perimeter.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe each triangle can be placed in a sector, but the sectors are spaced out so that their triangles don't interfere. For example, if the sectors are every other sector or something. 

---------------

Wait, this is getting too vague.

Perhaps I need to consider a specific construction that allows for arbitrarily many triangles each with perimeter above a certain t, and then see what t can be.

Suppose we arrange the triangles so that each triangle is an isosceles triangle with a very small base and two long sides. The two long sides would be nearly diameters of the circle. Let me see: if we have a triangle with two vertices close to each other on the circumference and the third vertex diametrically opposite. Then the two sides from the far vertex to the close vertices would be almost 2 units (the diameter), and the base between the two close vertices would be small. The perimeter would be approximately 2 + 2 + ε, where ε is the length of the base. So perimeter approaches 4 as the two points get closer.

If we can arrange many such triangles around the circle, each with their "base" near different points, then their perimeters can be made just over 4. Since the triangles would be "stretched out" towards the diameter, but their bases are near different points, their interiors might not overlap. Let me think:

Imagine placing a triangle with its base near the top of the circle, then another near the right side, another near the bottom, another near the left, and so on. Each triangle has its third vertex at the opposite point. Since the bases are small, the triangles are almost like diameters with a tiny "tip" at the base. Since the bases are placed at different positions, their interiors (which are the regions between the two long sides and the base) might not overlap. Because each triangle's interior is near its base, and the bases are separated by at least some angle. 

If the bases are spaced at least, say, 120 degrees apart, then their interiors wouldn't overlap. But if you have n triangles, you could space their bases every 2π/n radians. To prevent overlapping, the angular distance between any two bases should be more than some minimal angle. 

Suppose each triangle's base is an arc of angle θ, then to prevent overlapping, the next triangle's base must be at least θ away. So the total angle required per triangle is 2θ. Therefore, the number of triangles n would be at most π/θ (since total circumference is 2π). Therefore θ >= π/n. Thus, the length of the base is 2 sin(θ/2) ≈ θ (for small θ). So the base length is approximately π/n, so the perimeter is approximately 2 + 2 + π/n, which tends to 4 as n increases. So in this case, the perimeter can be made arbitrarily close to 4 for large n. Therefore, if we can do this, then t could be up to 4. But can we actually do this without overlapping?



---------------

Wait, let me think again. Each triangle has a base of angle θ, so the two vertices of the base are separated by angle θ. The third vertex is diametrically opposite the midpoint of the base? 

---------------

Wait, not exactly. If the third vertex is diametrically opposite to one of the base vertices, then the angle would be different. Let me clarify.

Suppose we have two points A and B on the circle, separated by angle θ. The third point C is diametrically opposite to the midpoint of the arc AB. 

---------------

Wait, but the position of C would depend on where A and B are. Alternatively, to make the two sides AC and BC as long as possible, we can place C such that it's as far as possible from the base AB. The farthest point from AB on the circle would be the point diametrically opposite the midpoint of AB. 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the triangle with vertices A, B, and C where C is diametrically opposite the midpoint of the arc AB. In this case, the sides AC and BC would be equal, and the length would be maximum. Let me calculate the perimeter in this case.

Let’s parameterize this. Let’s suppose points A and B are separated by angle θ, so the arc length between them is θ. The chord length AB is 2 sin(θ/2). The midpoint M of the arc AB is at angle θ/2 from A. The point C is diametrically opposite M, so it's θ/2 + π from A. The angle between A and C would then be π - θ/2. The chord length AC would be 2 sin( (π - θ/2)/2 ) = 2 sin( π/2 - θ/4 ) = 2 cos(θ/4). Similarly, BC is the same. The chord BC would also be 2 cos(θ/4). The third side is AB = 2 sin(θ/2). Therefore, the perimeter P is 2*2 cos(θ/4) + 2 sin(θ/2) = 4 cos(θ/4) + 2 sin(θ/2).

Now, if θ is small (so that the base AB is small), then cos(θ/4) ≈ 1 - (θ^2)/32 and sin(θ/2) ≈ θ/2 - (θ^3)/48. So:

P ≈ 4*(1 - θ²/32) + 2*(θ/2 - θ³/48) ≈ 4 - (θ²)/8 + θ - (θ³)/24.

So as θ becomes small (for large n), the perimeter approaches 4 + θ. 

---------------

Wait, but θ is the angle between A and B, which for the packing, needs to be at least something like 2π/n. 

---------------

Wait, but if θ is proportional to 1/n, then θ = 2π/k for some k related to n.



---------------

Wait, let me think again. If we have n such triangles, each with a base of angle θ, then the total angle taken up by all bases would be nθ. But since the circle is 2π, we need nθ ≤ 2π. Therefore θ ≤ 2π/n. So θ is on the order of 1/n. Therefore, substituting θ = 2π/m (where m is the number of triangles), so θ = 2π/n, then:

Perimeter P ≈ 4 + (2π/n) - ... So as n increases, the perimeter approaches 4 from above. Therefore, in this configuration, the perimeter can be made arbitrarily close to 4. Therefore, if we can indeed arrange n triangles in this way without overlapping, then the minimal t would be 4, and thus the maximum t we can choose is 4, since for any n, we can have triangles with perimeter just over 4. But we have to ensure that the interiors don't overlap.



---------------

Wait, but in this configuration, each triangle has its base on a small arc and the third vertex opposite. The problem is whether these triangles' interiors overlap. Let's see.

Imagine two adjacent triangles: each has a base on an arc of angle θ, separated by some angle. The third vertex is opposite the midpoint of their base. If the bases are separated by angle φ, then the two triangles' third vertices would be on opposite sides of the circle. However, the regions between the two long sides and the base might still overlap? Hmm, perhaps not if the bases are sufficiently spaced.



---------------

Alternatively, if we arrange the triangles so that their bases are equally spaced around the circle with angle between each base of at least θ, so that the third vertices are also spaced apart. 

---------------

Wait, perhaps if the angular distance between the bases is large enough, the triangles won't overlap. Let me try to visualize.

Suppose we have two triangles with bases separated by an angle of π. Then their third vertices would be on opposite sides, so their interiors are on opposite halves of the circle, so they don't overlap. But if they're closer, say separated by θ, then maybe their interiors could intersect.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the key is that the triangles are "thin" and their interiors lie near their bases. If the bases are spaced apart by sufficient angle, their interiors won't overlap. Let's suppose each triangle's base is an arc of angle θ, and they are spaced at least θ apart. Then the total angle taken by each triangle's base plus the spacing is 2θ, so the number of triangles n is at most π/θ. 

---------------

Wait, but if θ is 2π/n, then spacing would be similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-overlapping condition is automatically satisfied if the triangles are arranged such that their bases are on arcs that don't overlap and their third vertices are placed such that the triangles don't cross into each other's regions. If each triangle is in its own sector, separated from others, then their interiors won't overlap.

Suppose the circle is divided into n equal sectors, each of angle 2π/n. In each sector, we place a triangle with its base along a small arc within the sector and the third vertex at the opposite side. Since each sector is 2π/n, the base can be, say, an arc of angle θ within the sector, and the rest of the sector is spacing. To prevent overlapping with adjacent sectors, the spacing between bases must be maintained.



---------------

Alternatively, if each triangle is placed such that their bases are within their own sector and the third vertex is outside, but arranged so that the triangles don't cross into neighboring sectors. This might be possible if the third vertex is placed in the opposite sector. 

---------------

Wait, but with n sectors, the opposite sector would be n/2 sectors away. So if n is even, this could work. But perhaps this is getting too vague.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps a better way is to consider that if the triangles are arranged as described (each with a small base and a vertex opposite), then their interiors are contained within a semicircle opposite their base. Therefore, if we arrange the bases so that their opposite semicircles don't overlap, then the triangles won't overlap. To do this, the angular distance between any two bases must be at least π. Therefore, the number of such triangles is at most 2, since you can place one at the top and one at the bottom, but for n larger than 2, this approach doesn't work.

Hmm, so perhaps that configuration only allows 2 triangles. That's not good. So maybe that approach is flawed.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe instead of placing the third vertex diametrically opposite, we can place it in some other position so that the triangle's interior is contained within a smaller region. Maybe a different configuration where each triangle's interior is in a small region, allowing many triangles to be placed.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal configuration is to have all triangles arranged as regular triangles but scaled down. Wait, but regular triangles can't be scaled down without reducing their perimeter.



---------------

Alternatively, think of the problem in terms of the area. If each triangle must have a perimeter greater than t, then their area might also have a lower bound. But since the circle has fixed area π, the total area of n triangles can't exceed π. Therefore, the average area per triangle is at most π/n. But the area of a triangle inscribed in a circle of radius 1 is (1/2)ab sin θ, where a and b are sides and θ is the angle between them. Hmm, but relating area to perimeter is non-trivial.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps use the isoperimetric inequality for triangles, but I don't recall the exact form. Wait, the isoperimetric inequality for a triangle states that among all triangles with a given perimeter, the equilateral triangle has the maximum area. Not sure if that helps here.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe instead of focusing on perimeter, think in terms of side lengths. The minimal perimeter for a triangle inscribed in a circle with three vertices separated by certain angles. Let me consider an upper limit.

Suppose we can have triangles with perimeter approaching 6, which is the perimeter of a triangle with all sides as diameter (but that's impossible since three diameters would require colinear points). The maximum possible side length is 2 (the diameter). The maximum perimeter would be less than 6, but the equilateral triangle gives about 5.196. 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal perimeter in the packing is approaching 0 as n increases, but the problem requires that each triangle has perimeter greater than t for some t, regardless of n. Therefore, the question is to find the highest t such that no matter how large n is, you can still have n triangles each with perimeter above t. So the critical value is the infimum of the suprema over n. 

---------------

Wait, perhaps the lim inf as n approaches infinity of the minimal perimeter in any packing of n triangles. Then the maximum t is that lim inf.

If in the construction where perimeters approach 4 as n increases, then that lim inf would be 4, so t can be 4. But is that achievable?



---------------

Wait, going back to the earlier idea: if you can arrange n triangles each with perimeter approaching 4 as n increases, then t could be 4. But is there a better lower bound?



---------------

Alternatively, maybe there's another configuration where the perimeter doesn't drop below a higher value. For example, if triangles are arranged as regular triangles but scaled appropriately.

Suppose instead of having very skinny triangles, we arrange triangles in a way that each triangle is a 30-30-120 triangle. Let's compute its perimeter.

Central angles would be 60°, 60°, and 240°, but that adds to 360°, so actually 60, 60, 240. 

---------------

Wait, but in terms of chord lengths:

The two equal sides would correspond to 60° arcs, so their chord lengths are 2 sin(30°) = 1. The long side corresponds to 240°, so chord length is 2 sin(120°) = 2*(√3/2) = √3 ≈1.732. So the perimeter would be 1 + 1 + 1.732 ≈ 3.732, which is less than 4. So that's worse.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe 90-90-180 triangle? Wait, 180° is a straight line, so that's degenerate. Not a triangle.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe 120-120-120, which is equilateral, perimeter ~5.196. But as mentioned before, you can't have many of those without overlapping.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration with perimeter approaching 4 is indeed the best possible, so t=4. Let me check if that's possible.

Suppose we divide the circle into n equal arcs, each of angle 2π/n. For each arc, we can create a triangle by taking two points close together on that arc and the third point diametrically opposite the midpoint of the arc. 

---------------

Wait, but if the arc is 2π/n, then the midpoint is π/n from each end. The two points can be very close, say separated by angle ε, so their chord is ~ε. The third point is diametrically opposite the midpoint, so the angle from each end to the third point is π - (π/n - ε/2). Hmm, getting confused again.



---------------

Alternatively, let me formalize:

Let’s parameterize each triangle as follows: For each triangle, choose an arc of angle θ on the circle. Place two vertices at the endpoints of this arc, and the third vertex diametrically opposite the midpoint of the arc. The midpoint of the arc is at θ/2 from each endpoint. The diametrically opposite point would be π radians away from the midpoint, so the angle from each endpoint to the third vertex is π - (θ/2).

Therefore, the chord lengths:

Between the two endpoints: chord length is 2 sin(θ/2).

Between each endpoint and the third vertex: chord length is 2 sin( (π - θ/2)/2 ) = 2 sin( π/2 - θ/4 ) = 2 cos(θ/4).

Therefore, the perimeter is 2 sin(θ/2) + 2 * 2 cos(θ/4) = 2 sin(θ/2) + 4 cos(θ/4).



---------------

Wait, no, wait: two sides are each 2 cos(θ/4), and one side is 2 sin(θ/2). So total perimeter P = 2 sin(θ/2) + 2 * 2 cos(θ/4) = 2 sin(θ/2) + 4 cos(θ/4).



---------------

Wait, actually, two sides: from each endpoint to the third vertex. Each is 2 cos(θ/4). So two sides of 2 cos(θ/4) and one of 2 sin(θ/2). So yes, P = 2 sin(θ/2) + 4 cos(θ/4).

Let’s see when θ is small. Let’s let θ approach 0. Then:

sin(θ/2) ≈ θ/2,

cos(θ/4) ≈ 1 - (θ/4)^2 / 2 = 1 - θ²/(32).

Therefore,

P ≈ 2*(θ/2) + 4*(1 - θ²/32) = θ + 4 - (θ²)/8.

So as θ approaches 0, P approaches 4. Therefore, by making θ very small, the perimeter approaches 4.

Now, to arrange n such triangles without overlapping, we need to place each triangle's arc (the base) on the circle such that their "third vertices" don't cause overlaps. Since each triangle's third vertex is diametrically opposite the midpoint of its base, the position of the third vertex is determined by the base's position.

If we space the bases evenly around the circle, each separated by angle φ, then the third vertices will also be spaced in some pattern. To prevent overlapping of the triangles' interiors, we need to ensure that the regions occupied by the triangles do not intersect.

The triangle's interior is the area bounded by the three chords. The two long sides go from the endpoints of the base to the third vertex. Since the third vertex is diametrically opposite the midpoint, the triangle is symmetric with respect to the line through the center perpendicular to the base.

If we place the bases around the circle with sufficient spacing, their corresponding third vertices will be on the opposite side, and the triangles will not overlap. Specifically, if two bases are separated by an angle greater than π, their third vertices will be on opposite sides, so the triangles won't overlap. But if they are closer, the triangles might intersect.

To prevent overlap, the angular distance between any two bases must be at least π. Therefore, the maximum number of such triangles we can place is 2, since the circle is 2π. But this contradicts the requirement for arbitrary n. So this approach only allows 2 triangles.

Hmm, so maybe this configuration isn't suitable for large n. Perhaps a different configuration is needed.



---------------

Alternative idea: instead of placing the third vertex diametrically opposite, place it somewhere else such that the triangle's interior is confined to a sector, allowing multiple triangles in different sectors.

Suppose we divide the circle into n equal sectors, each with angle 2π/n. In each sector, place a triangle such that all three vertices lie within that sector. The perimeter of such a triangle would depend on how "spread out" the vertices are within the sector.

If the sector angle is 2π/n, the maximum possible perimeter in that sector would be achieved when the triangle is as large as possible within the sector. For example, placing the three vertices at the endpoints and the midpoint of the arc. But even then, as n increases, the sector angle becomes small, so the triangle's sides would be small, leading to a small perimeter.



---------------

Alternatively, to maximize the perimeter within a sector of angle α, perhaps place two vertices at the endpoints of the sector's arc and the third vertex somewhere along the arc. The perimeter would then be the sum of two chord lengths (from the endpoints to the third vertex) plus the arc's chord.



---------------

Wait, let me formalize this. Let the sector have central angle α. Let the two endpoints be A and B, separated by angle α. Let the third point C be somewhere on the arc AB. The perimeter would be AC + CB + AB.

AB is fixed at 2 sin(α/2). The points AC and CB depend on where C is placed. To maximize the perimeter, we need to maximize AC + CB. Since AC + CB is maximized when C is as far as possible from the chord AB, which would be at the midpoint of the arc AB. 

---------------

Wait, but in that case, AC and CB would both be equal to the chord length from A (or B) to the midpoint. The midpoint is at angle α/2 from A, so chord length AC = 2 sin(α/4). Therefore, AC + CB = 2*2 sin(α/4) = 4 sin(α/4). So the total perimeter would be 4 sin(α/4) + 2 sin(α/2).



---------------

Wait, but if we set C to the midpoint, that might give a larger perimeter? Let me compute:

Alternatively, if C is at the midpoint, then AC = CB = 2 sin(α/4). So perimeter P = 2*(2 sin(α/4)) + 2 sin(α/2) = 4 sin(α/4) + 2 sin(α/2). 



---------------

Alternatively, if C is at one of the endpoints, say A, then CB would be the full chord AB = 2 sin(α/2), and AC =0, so perimeter would be AB + 0 + CB which is the same as AB + CB but that's degenerate.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps placing C not at the midpoint gives a better perimeter? Wait, but when C is at the midpoint, the two sides AC and CB are maximized because moving C away from the midpoint towards A would reduce AC but increase CB? 

---------------

Wait, no. Actually, the maximum of AC + CB occurs when C is at the midpoint. Because by the triangle inequality, for points on a circle, the sum of distances from a moving point to two fixed points is maximized when the point is diametrically opposite the midpoint? 

---------------

Wait, maybe not exactly, but in a sector.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum AC + CB is indeed 4 sin(α/4). So the perimeter is 4 sin(α/4) + 2 sin(α/2). Let me compute this for small α.

If α is small (since n is large, α = 2π/n is small), then:

sin(α/4) ≈ α/4 - (α/4)^3/6,

sin(α/2) ≈ α/2 - (α/2)^3/6.

Thus,

4 sin(α/4) ≈ 4*(α/4 - α^3/(384)) = α - α^3/96,

2 sin(α/2) ≈ 2*(α/2 - α^3/(48)) = α - α^3/24.

Adding them together:

Total P ≈ (α - α^3/96) + (α - α^3/24) = 2α - ( (1/96 + 1/24 ) α^3 )

= 2α - (5/96 α^3 )

So for very small α (large n), the perimeter is approximately 2α. Since α = 2π/n, then P ≈ 4π/n. As n increases, this goes to zero. That's bad, because we need perimeter greater than t for any n. So this approach won't work because the perimeter becomes too small.

Hmm, so this suggests that confining each triangle to a small sector leads to perimeters that go to zero, which is not acceptable. So that approach is no good.



---------------

Alternative idea: maybe arrange the triangles in a star-like pattern, where each triangle shares a common vertex at the center, but since the triangles must be inscribed in the circle, their vertices can't be at the center. 

---------------

Wait, all vertices must be on the circumference.

Alternatively, arrange all triangles such that they all share a common edge or something, but without overlapping. Not sure.



---------------

Alternatively, think of the problem in terms of graph theory: each triangle is a node, and edges represent overlapping. We need an independent set of size n in this graph. But this is too abstract.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the answer is 3√3, the perimeter of the equilateral triangle, but as I thought before, you can't have more than 3 equilateral triangles without overlapping. Since the problem requires for any n, including n=4,5,…, so that can’t be.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the maximal t is 6, but that’s impossible because the maximum possible perimeter is less than 6.



---------------

Alternatively, going back to the first idea, if we can place n triangles each with perimeter approaching 4 as n increases, then the maximum t is 4. Since for any n, we can have triangles with perimeter just over 4. But earlier problem was that arranging them without overlapping for large n required spacing that limited the number.



---------------

Wait, perhaps another way to arrange the triangles: instead of having the third vertex diametrically opposite, place it somewhere else so that the triangles can be packed more densely.

Suppose each triangle has two vertices very close together on the circumference and the third vertex somewhere else, but arranged such that these "spindles" don't overlap. For example, imagine many "needle-like" triangles pointing in different directions. Each triangle has a very short base and a long side going out to a tip, but the tips are arranged so they don't come close to each other.

Specifically, suppose we place n triangles, each with a base of angle θ (small) on the circumference, and the third vertex placed at a point that's θ away from the base's midpoint. 

---------------

Wait, but need to calculate.

Alternatively, place each triangle such that its third vertex is at a fixed distance from the base. Let me try to formalize this.

Let each triangle have two vertices separated by angle θ, and the third vertex is placed at an angle φ from the midpoint of the base. The chord lengths can then be calculated.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps if all the third vertices are placed on a smaller concentric circle inside the unit circle, but the problem states that all vertices must be on the circumference. So that won't work.



---------------

Alternatively, arrange all third vertices along a semicircle. For example, place all the bases on one semicircle and the third vertices on the opposite semicircle. If the bases are spaced evenly on the bottom semicircle, their third vertices can be spaced on the top semicircle. The key is that the triangles don't cross into each other's areas.

Suppose we divide the bottom semicircle into n arcs, each of angle π/n. Each base is one of these arcs, and the third vertex is placed diametrically opposite the midpoint of each base. The midpoint of each base is at an angle of (kπ/n + (k+1)π/n)/2 = (2k+1)π/(2n) from the starting point. The diametrically opposite point would be at angle (2k+1)π/(2n) + π = (2k+1)π/(2n) + 2π/2 = ( (2k+1) + 2n ) π/(2n ). 

---------------

Wait, but this is getting complex.

Alternatively, each base is an arc of angle π/n on the bottom semicircle, so the midpoint is at angle (k*2π/n + (k+1)*2π/n)/2? 

---------------

Wait, maybe better to parameterize.

Let me consider the bottom semicircle from angle 0 to π. Divide it into n equal arcs, each of angle π/n. Each base is one of these arcs, from angle (k-1)π/n to kπ/n for k=1 to n. The midpoint of each base is at angle (2k-1)π/(2n). The third vertex is diametrically opposite this midpoint, so at angle (2k-1)π/(2n) + π = (2k-1)π/(2n) + 2π/2 = ( (2k-1)π + 2nπ )/(2n ). 

---------------

Wait, no, diametrically opposite would just be adding π radians. So the angle becomes (2k-1)π/(2n) + π = (2k -1)π/(2n) + 2πn/(2n) )= [ (2k -1) + 2n ] π/(2n ). Hmm, not sure.



---------------

Alternatively, the third vertex's angle is the midpoint angle plus π. So if the midpoint is at angle α, the third vertex is at α + π. So for each base at position k, the third vertex is at angle (2k-1)π/(2n) + π = (2k -1)π/(2n) + 2πn/(2n) ) = [ (2k -1) + 2n ] π/(2n ). 

---------------

Wait, perhaps it's better to just note that the third vertex is on the upper semicircle.

The key point is that each triangle has its base on the lower semicircle and its third vertex on the upper semicircle. The triangles will then be "pointing upwards". Since all the bases are on the lower semicircle and spaced every π/n, their third vertices are spaced around the upper semicircle. Since there are n bases, the third vertices are also spaced every π/n on the upper semicircle. Thus, each triangle's third vertex is separated by π/n from its neighbors.

Now, do these triangles overlap? The triangle with base k has vertices at ( (k-1)π/n, kπ/n ) on the lower semicircle and the third vertex at angle (2k-1)π/(2n) + π. 

---------------

Wait, perhaps their interiors don't overlap because each triangle is in a "slice" between two adjacent bases. Let me see:

The triangle with base from angle a to b on the lower semicircle has its third vertex above. The triangle's edges go from a to the third vertex, b to the third vertex, and a to b. The area of the triangle is above the lower semicircle between a and b. Since each such triangle is confined to its own π/n sector on the lower semicircle, their upper parts don't overlap because the third vertices are spaced apart on the upper semicircle. 

Therefore, this configuration allows n triangles without overlapping, each with a base of angle π/n on the lower semicircle and a third vertex on the upper semicircle. Let's calculate their perimeters.

Let’s compute the perimeter of one such triangle. Let’s denote the central angle between the two base endpoints as θ = π/n. The chord length of the base is 2 sin(θ/2) = 2 sin(π/(2n)). 

The third vertex is diametrically opposite the midpoint of the base. The midpoint of the base is at angle (a + b)/2 = ( (k-1)π/n + kπ/n ) / 2 = (2k -1)π/(2n). The third vertex is at this angle plus π, so its angle is (2k -1)π/(2n) + π = (2k -1)π/(2n) + 2πn/(2n) ) = [ (2k -1) + 2n ] π/(2n ). But the exact angle might not matter for perimeter calculation.

The distance from each base endpoint to the third vertex: Let’s compute the chord length between one endpoint (angle a) and the third vertex (angle a + π + something). 

---------------

Wait, perhaps better to use central angles.

The central angle between a base endpoint (say at angle 0 for simplicity) and the third vertex (which is diametrically opposite the midpoint). If the base is from 0 to θ = π/n, the midpoint is at θ/2. The third vertex is at θ/2 + π. So the central angle between 0 and the third vertex is θ/2 + π. 

Thus, the chord length from 0 to third vertex is 2 sin( (θ/2 + π)/2 ) = 2 sin( π/2 + θ/4 ) = 2 cos(θ/4). Similarly, the chord from θ to the third vertex is also 2 cos(θ/4). 

Therefore, the perimeter P is:

Base: 2 sin(θ/2)

Two sides: 2 * 2 cos(θ/4) = 4 cos(θ/4)

Total perimeter P = 2 sin(θ/2) + 4 cos(θ/4).

Which is the same expression as before. With θ = π/n.

Therefore, substituting θ = π/n,

P = 2 sin(π/(2n)) + 4 cos( π/(4n) ).

Now, as n becomes large, θ approaches 0, so we can approximate:

sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n) - (π/(2n))³ / 6,

cos(π/(4n)) ≈ 1 - (π/(4n))² / 2.

Therefore,

P ≈ 2*( π/(2n) ) + 4*(1 - π²/(32 n²) )

= π/n + 4 - (4 * π²)/(32 n² )

≈ 4 + π/n - (π²)/(8 n² )

So as n increases, the perimeter approaches 4 from above. Thus, for any n, we can have triangles with perimeter just over 4. Therefore, this construction allows us to have a good collection of n triangles each with perimeter greater than any t less than 4. Since we can make the perimeter as close to 4 as desired for sufficiently large n, the supremum of such t is 4. However, we need to ensure that this construction indeed prevents overlapping for any n.

Earlier concern was whether the triangles would overlap, but in this configuration, each triangle is confined to its own sector on the lower semicircle and their third vertices are on the upper semicircle spaced apart. The triangles' interiors lie above their respective bases and do not overlap with other triangles' areas because their third vertices are spaced π/n apart on the upper semicircle. The edges from the base endpoints to the third vertices are all in different directions, so they shouldn't cross each other. Thus, this configuration should work for any n, and the perimeters approach 4 as n increases.

Therefore, the maximum value of t is 4, since for any t < 4, we can choose n large enough such that the perimeter exceeds t, and for any n, we can have perimeters just above 4. However, since the problem asks for the maximum t such that for every n, there exists a collection with each perimeter greater than t, the value t must be the infimum of the perimeters as n increases, which is 4. Hence, the answer is 4.



---------------

Wait, but let me confirm with an example. For n=1, the single triangle can be the equilateral triangle with perimeter ~5.196, which is greater than 4. For n=2, we can have two triangles as described, each with perimeter approaching 4 as n increases, but for n=2, θ=π/2, so let's compute their actual perimeter.

For n=2, θ=π/2. Then,

P = 2 sin(π/4) + 4 cos(π/8).

Compute sin(π/4)=√2/2≈0.7071,

cos(π/8)≈0.9239.

Thus,

P≈2*(0.7071) +4*(0.9239)≈1.4142 + 3.6956≈5.1098.

So for n=2, each triangle has perimeter ~5.11, which is still above 4. For n=3, θ=π/3≈1.047,

sin(π/6)=0.5,

cos(π/12)≈0.9659.

Thus,

P≈2*0.5 +4*0.9659≈1 + 3.8636≈4.8636.

Still above 4. For n=4, θ=π/4,

sin(π/8)≈0.3827,

cos(π/16)≈0.9808.

P≈2*0.3827 +4*0.9808≈0.7654 + 3.923≈4.6884.

Continuing, n=10, θ=π/10≈0.314,

sin(π/20)≈0.1564,

cos(π/40)≈0.9877.

P≈2*0.1564 +4*0.9877≈0.3128 + 3.9508≈4.2636.

n=100, θ=π/100≈0.0314,

sin(π/200)≈0.0157,

cos(π/400)≈0.9998.

Thus,

P≈2*0.0157 +4*0.9998≈0.0314 + 3.9992≈4.0306.

So as n increases, P approaches 4. Thus, for any n, the perimeter is greater than 4, approaching it as n grows. Hence, the minimal such t is 4, so the maximum t is 4.

Therefore, the answer should be 4.

**Final Answer**
Answer: \boxed{4}


To determine the maximum value of \( t \) such that for each positive integer \( n \), there exists a good collection of \( n \) triangles, each with a perimeter greater than \( t \), we analyze the configuration of triangles inscribed in a circle of radius 1.

1. **Perimeter Calculation for a Triangle Inscribed in a Circle**:
   - For a triangle with central angles \( \alpha, \beta, \gamma \), the side lengths are \( 2 \sin(\alpha/2) \), \( 2 \sin(\beta/2) \), and \( 2 \sin(\gamma/2) \).
   - The perimeter \( P \) is \( 2(\sin(\alpha/2) + \sin(\beta/2) + \sin(\gamma/2)) \).

2. **Configuration for Non-Overlapping Triangles**:
   - Consider dividing the circle into \( n \) equal arcs, each of angle \( \theta = \pi/n \).
   - Each triangle is formed by placing two vertices at the endpoints of an arc and the third vertex diametrically opposite the midpoint of the arc.
   - The central angle between the endpoints of the base is \( \theta \), and the central angle from each endpoint to the third vertex is \( \pi - \theta/2 \).

3. **Perimeter Calculation for Each Triangle**:
   - The base length is \( 2 \sin(\theta/2) \).
   - The lengths of the other two sides are each \( 2 \cos(\theta/4) \).
   - The perimeter \( P \) is \( 2 \sin(\theta/2) + 4 \cos(\theta/4) \).

4. **Approximation for Large \( n \)**:
   - For small \( \theta \) (large \( n \)), using approximations:
     - \( \sin(\theta/2) \approx \theta/2 \)
     - \( \cos(\theta/4) \approx 1 - (\theta/4)^2/2 \)
   - The perimeter \( P \approx 4 \) as \( \theta \to 0 \).

5. **Non-Overlapping Verification**:
   - Each triangle is confined to its own sector on the lower semicircle with the third vertex on the upper semicircle.
   - The spacing ensures that the triangles do not overlap.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - For any \( n \), the perimeter of each triangle can be made arbitrarily close to 4 by choosing a sufficiently large \( n \).
   - Therefore, the maximum value of \( t \) such that each triangle's perimeter exceeds \( t \) for any \( n \) is 4.

The final answer is \(\boxed{4}\).
