Okay, let's see. I need to find the length of AB in an equilateral triangle ABC where the area inside a certain circle but outside the triangle is given as 800π - 600√3. Hmm. Let me break this down step by step.

First, since ABC is equilateral, all sides are equal, so AB = BC = CA. Let's denote the length of AB as 's'. That way, all sides are length 's'. The problem mentions point D is the midpoint of BC. Since BC is length 's', then BD = DC = s/2.

Next, there's a circle Ω with diameter AD. I need to figure out the radius of this circle. The diameter is AD, so the radius would be half of AD. To find AD, maybe I can use some properties of the equilateral triangle. In an equilateral triangle, the median, angle bisector, and altitude are all the same line. So AD is also the altitude of the triangle.

The altitude of an equilateral triangle with side length s can be calculated using the formula (√3/2)s. So AD = (√3/2)s. Therefore, the radius of circle Ω is half of that, which would be (√3/4)s. 

---------------

Wait, no, hold on. The diameter is AD, so radius is AD divided by 2. So radius r = ( (√3/2)s ) / 2 = (√3/4)s. Yes, that's right.

Now, the area inside the circle Ω but outside the triangle ABC is given as 800π - 600√3. So I need to compute the area of the circle minus the area of the part of the triangle that's inside the circle. 

---------------

Wait, actually, the problem says "the region inside Ω and outside △ABC", so that's the area of the circle minus the area of the overlapping region between the circle and the triangle. 

---------------

Alternatively, it's the area of the circle not covered by the triangle. 

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the area of the circle minus the area of the part of the triangle that lies inside the circle. Hmm. Let me visualize this. The circle has diameter AD. Since AD is the altitude, the circle is drawn with its diameter along the altitude from A to BC. The circle will pass through points A and D, and its center is the midpoint of AD. Since D is the midpoint of BC, the circle is probably intersecting the triangle in some way.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I should draw a diagram mentally. Let me think. In an equilateral triangle, the altitude is from A to BC, so AD is perpendicular to BC. The circle with diameter AD will have its center at the midpoint of AD, so that's a point halfway between A and D. The radius is half of AD, so as we found, (√3/4)s. Since the center is halfway along AD, the circle will extend from A down to D. But since the radius is (√3/4)s, which is half of the altitude, the circle will also extend beyond D? 

---------------

Wait, no, because the diameter is AD, so the circle's endpoints are A and D, so the radius is half of that. 

---------------

Wait, actually, the diameter is AD, so the radius is (AD)/2. So the center is the midpoint of AD, so the circle will pass through A and D, and any point on the circle must be such that its distance from the center is equal to the radius.

Hmm, maybe I should compute coordinates to make this precise. Let me place the triangle in coordinate system to make calculations easier. Let me set point A at (0, h), and points B and C on the x-axis. Since it's an equilateral triangle, coordinates can be set as follows:

Let me set point B at (-s/2, 0), point C at (s/2, 0), so that BC is centered at the origin. Then the midpoint D of BC is at (0,0). 

---------------

Wait, but then the altitude from A would be along the y-axis. Let me confirm:

If ABC is equilateral with side length s, then coordinates can be set with point A at (0, h), where h is the height. The height h is (√3/2)s. So coordinates:

A: (0, (√3/2)s)

B: (-s/2, 0)

C: (s/2, 0)

Then midpoint D of BC is indeed ( ( (-s/2) + (s/2) ) / 2, (0 + 0)/2 ) = (0,0). 

---------------

Wait, so point D is at the origin (0,0). So AD is the line from A (0, (√3/2)s) to D (0,0). So AD is along the y-axis with length (√3/2)s. Therefore, the circle with diameter AD has endpoints at A (0, (√3/2)s) and D (0,0). The center of the circle is the midpoint of AD, which is (0, (√3/4)s). The radius is half of AD, so (√3/4)s.

So the equation of the circle is (x - 0)^2 + (y - (√3/4)s)^2 = ( (√3/4)s )^2.

Simplifying, that's x² + ( y - (√3 s /4) )² = ( 3 s² ) / 16.

Now, the area inside the circle but outside the triangle. The triangle is the equilateral triangle with vertices at (-s/2, 0), (s/2, 0), and (0, (√3/2)s). The circle is centered along the y-axis, so it's symmetric. The area we want is the part of the circle that's not inside the triangle. Since the triangle is above the circle? 

---------------

Wait, actually, the triangle has vertex A at the top, so the circle is drawn from A down to D (the origin). So the circle is sitting along the altitude, extending from the top vertex A down to the midpoint D of BC. So the circle will bulge out to the sides, but since the triangle is also there, perhaps the region inside the circle but outside the triangle is the lower part of the circle below the triangle?



---------------

Wait, let me think again. The triangle's sides are from A to B and A to C. The circle is centered on the y-axis, with radius (√3/4)s. Let me see if points B and C are inside the circle. Let's check point B: coordinates (-s/2, 0). The distance from the center (0, √3 s /4) to point B is sqrt( (s/2)^2 + ( √3 s /4 )^2 )

Calculating:

( (s/2)^2 + ( (√3 s)/4 )^2 ) = ( s²/4 + (3 s²)/16 ) = (4 s² + 3 s²)/16 = 7 s² /16. So the distance is sqrt(7)/4 s. The radius is (√3)/4 s. Since sqrt(7) ≈ 2.645 and sqrt(3) ≈1.732, sqrt(7) > sqrt(3), so sqrt(7)/4 s > sqrt(3)/4 s. Therefore, point B is outside the circle. Similarly for point C. So the circle does not contain points B and C. The circle is entirely within the triangle? 

---------------

Wait, but the area inside the circle but outside the triangle is given as positive. Hmm, maybe I need to visualize this again.



---------------

Wait, the circle has diameter AD. Since AD is the altitude, the circle goes from A (the top vertex) down to D (the midpoint of BC). The circle's center is halfway between A and D, so at (0, (√3/4)s). The radius is (√3/4)s. So the circle extends from y=0 (point D) up to y=(√3/2)s (point A). The bottom of the circle is at y=0, which is point D, and the top is at point A.

Now, the triangle has its base BC along the x-axis from (-s/2, 0) to (s/2, 0), and vertex at A (0, (√3/2)s). The sides of the triangle are the lines from A to B and A to C.

So the circle is sitting along the altitude, and its sides will curve outwards. But since the triangle's sides slope inward, the circle might extend beyond the triangle on the sides? 

---------------

Wait, but when we check point B, which is on the edge of the triangle, we saw that the distance from the center to B is sqrt(7)/4 s, which is greater than the radius sqrt(3)/4 s. Therefore, the circle does not reach point B. So the circle is entirely inside the triangle except perhaps at the top? 

---------------

Wait, but the top of the circle is exactly at point A, which is part of the triangle. The bottom is at D, which is also part of the triangle. So actually, the circle is entirely inside the triangle except maybe near the sides?



---------------

Wait, perhaps the circle is entirely within the triangle? But the problem states that there is a region inside the circle but outside the triangle. That must mean that part of the circle is outside the triangle. Hmm, maybe my coordinate system is off? Let me check again.



---------------

Wait, if the circle has its center at (0, (√3/4)s) and radius (√3/4)s, then the bottom of the circle is at y=0 (point D), and the top is at point A. The circle's equation is x² + (y - (√3 s /4))² = ( (√3 s /4 ) )². If we plug in y=0, then x² + ( (√3 s /4 ) )² = ( (√3 s /4 ) )², so x² =0, so only the point D is on the x-axis. So the circle only touches the base at D. The sides of the circle would extend out to the sides, but since the triangle's sides slope inward, perhaps the circle is actually outside the triangle near the sides?



---------------

Wait, let's pick a point on the circle at the same height as, say, halfway up. Let me pick a point at y-coordinate equal to the center's y-coordinate. The center is at (0, √3 s /4). At that y-coordinate, the circle's equation gives x² + 0 = ( (√3 s /4 ) )², so x = ± (√3 s)/4. So at the center's y-coordinate, the circle extends to x = ± (√3 s)/4. Compare this to the triangle's sides. The triangle's sides at that y-coordinate would be where?

The sides of the triangle are lines from A (0, (√3/2)s) to B (-s/2, 0). Let me find the x-coordinate on the triangle's side at y = √3 s /4.

The equation of side AB can be parameterized. Let's compute the slope of AB. From point A (0, (√3/2)s) to B (-s/2, 0). The slope is (0 - (√3/2)s) / (-s/2 - 0) = (-√3/2 s)/(-s/2) = √3. So the equation is y - (√3/2)s = √3(x - 0). So y = √3 x + (√3/2)s.



---------------

Wait, let me check when y = √3 s /4. Let's set √3 x + (√3/2)s = √3 s /4. Subtract (√3/2)s from both sides:

√3 x = (√3 s /4) - (√3 s /2) = (√3 s /4 - 2√3 s /4) = (-√3 s)/4

Divide both sides by √3:

x = -s/4

So at y = √3 s /4, the triangle's side AB is at x = -s/4. Similarly, the other side AC would be at x = +s/4.

But the circle at that y-coordinate (center's y-coordinate) has x = ± (√3 s)/4 ≈ ±0.433 s. Comparing to the triangle's x-coordinate at that height, which is ± s/4 = ±0.25 s. So the circle extends beyond the triangle at that height. Therefore, the circle is indeed bulging out beyond the triangle on the sides. Therefore, the region inside the circle but outside the triangle is the parts of the circle that are outside the triangle. So the area would be the area of the circle minus the area of the part of the circle that's inside the triangle.



---------------

Alternatively, since the triangle cuts off parts of the circle, the area outside the triangle but inside the circle would be the circle's area minus the overlapping area with the triangle. Since the problem states that area is 800π - 600√3, so we can set up an equation.

First, let me compute the area of the circle. The radius is (√3 /4)s, so area is π*( (√3 /4 s)^2 ) = π*( 3/16 s² ) = (3π/16)s².

Now, the overlapping area between the circle and the triangle. Since the circle is centered along the altitude, and the triangle is symmetric, the overlapping region is symmetric on both sides. So maybe the overlapping area is the part of the circle that's inside the triangle. To compute that, perhaps we can find the area of the circle that is inside the triangle. Since the circle extends beyond the triangle on the sides, but is inside along the altitude. 

---------------

Wait, actually, at the center line (the y-axis), the circle is entirely within the triangle, but as we go to the sides, beyond x = ± s/4 at the center's y-coordinate, the circle is outside the triangle.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the overlapping area is the region of the circle that is below the triangle's sides? Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think of integrating or using geometric formulas.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the area inside the circle and outside the triangle is two times the area of the circle segment that's outside the triangle on each side. Since it's symmetric, we can compute the area on one side and double it.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the overlapping area can be found by subtracting the area of the triangle segments from the circle. Wait, maybe it's better to compute the area of the circle that is inside the triangle and then subtract that from the circle's area to get the desired region.



---------------

Alternatively, let's consider that the region inside the circle and outside the triangle is the part of the circle that is not overlapped by the triangle. So, Area = Circle Area - Overlap Area.

Given that this Area is given as 800π - 600√3, so:

Circle Area - Overlap Area = 800π - 600√3

Therefore, Overlap Area = Circle Area - (800π - 600√3 )

But maybe another approach is better. Let me think again.



---------------

Alternatively, since the circle is symmetric with respect to the altitude, and the triangle is also symmetric, the area outside the triangle but inside the circle would consist of two congruent regions on either side of the altitude. Let me consider the right half of the figure (since it's symmetric). The right half of the circle and the right half of the triangle.

In the right half, the circle's boundary is from the center at (0, √3 s /4) with radius √3 s /4. The equation in the first quadrant (x ≥0, y ≥0) is x² + (y - √3 s /4)^2 = ( √3 s /4 )².

The triangle's right side is the line from A(0, √3 s /2) to C(s/2, 0). The equation of this side is similar to the left side. Let me compute the equation for the right side AC.

Slope from A to C: (0 - √3 s /2)/(s/2 - 0) = (-√3 s /2)/(s/2) = -√3. So equation is y - √3 s /2 = -√3 (x - 0), so y = -√3 x + √3 s /2.

So in the first quadrant, the triangle's boundary is y = -√3 x + √3 s /2.

The circle's equation in the first quadrant can be written as y = √3 s /4 + sqrt( ( √3 s /4 )² - x² ). 

---------------

Wait, actually solving for y:

x² + (y - √3 s /4)^2 = ( √3 s /4 )²

=> (y - √3 s /4)^2 = ( √3 s /4 )² - x²

=> y - √3 s /4 = ± sqrt( (3 s² /16 ) - x² )

But since we are in the upper half (since the circle goes from y=0 up to y= √3 s /2 ), the relevant part would be y = √3 s /4 + sqrt( 3 s² /16 - x² )



---------------

Wait, actually, depending on the x. Hmm, maybe parametrize or use integration.

Alternatively, perhaps the area we need can be found by integrating the area between the circle and the triangle from x=0 to x= s/2 (the right half). But this might get complicated.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. Since the problem involves an equilateral triangle and a circle related to its altitude, perhaps there are known formulas or symmetries we can exploit.



---------------

Alternatively, let's consider the area inside the circle but outside the triangle. Since the circle is drawn with diameter AD, and AD is an altitude, maybe the region outside the triangle but inside the circle is a segment of the circle. 

---------------

Wait, perhaps the area is a lens-shaped region formed by the intersection?

Wait, actually, the circle is passing through point A and D. The triangle has vertex A and base BC. Since D is the midpoint of BC, the circle is sitting on the base at D and touching the vertex A. The area inside the circle but outside the triangle would be the parts of the circle that are below the triangle's sides but above the base? 

---------------

Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the region inside the circle but outside the triangle is the part of the circle that is below the triangle. Since the triangle covers the central part of the circle, the area outside the triangle would be the two "lunes" on the sides?

Hmm, maybe. Let me think again. The circle is centered at (0, √3 s /4) with radius √3 s /4. The triangle's sides form a boundary. The area inside the circle but outside the triangle would be the parts of the circle that are outside the triangle. Since the triangle is above the circle's lower parts?



---------------

Alternatively, maybe it's the area of the circle minus the area of the sector of the circle that's inside the triangle. 

---------------

Wait, perhaps the overlapping region is a sector minus a triangle or something?

Alternatively, perhaps the area inside both the circle and the triangle is a segment, and the area we want is the circle minus that segment.



---------------

Alternatively, let me think of the circle and the triangle. The circle is entirely within the triangle except near the sides? 

---------------

Wait, earlier calculation showed that at the center's y-coordinate (√3 s /4), the circle's x-coordinate reaches ±√3 s /4, while the triangle's x-coordinate at that height is ±s/4. Since √3/4 ≈0.433 and 1/4=0.25, so the circle extends beyond the triangle on the sides. Therefore, the area inside the circle but outside the triangle would be the parts of the circle that are outside the triangle's sides. Since the triangle is narrower there, the circle extends beyond.

Therefore, the area we need is the area of the circle minus the area of the part of the circle that's inside the triangle. To compute the area of the part of the circle inside the triangle, perhaps we can compute the area of the circle that is under the triangle's sides.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the area outside the triangle but inside the circle as two times the area of the circle segment on one side beyond the triangle's edge.

Let me consider the right half. The circle on the right side is bounded by x from 0 to √3 s /4 (the radius in x-direction at the center's y-coordinate). 

---------------

Wait, actually, the circle's maximum x at any y is sqrt( (radius)^2 - (y - center y)^2 ). Hmm, maybe we can compute the area in the first quadrant where the circle is outside the triangle and then multiply by 2.



---------------

Alternatively, let me set up an integral for the area in the first quadrant outside the triangle but inside the circle, then double it for both sides.

So, in the first quadrant:

The circle's equation: x² + (y - √3 s /4)^2 = ( √3 s /4 )².

The triangle's side AC is y = -√3 x + (√3 s)/2.

We can find the points where the circle and the triangle intersect besides point A and D.



---------------

Wait, we know they intersect at point A (0, √3 s /2) and at point D (0,0). 

---------------

Wait, but D is the midpoint of BC, which is at (0,0). Wait, in our coordinate system, yes. So the circle passes through A and D, but also, does it intersect the triangle's sides anywhere else?

Let me check. Suppose there is another intersection point on side AC. Let me set the equations equal.

The circle equation and the triangle's side AC equation:

From the triangle: y = -√3 x + (√3 s)/2.

Plug into the circle equation:

x² + ( (-√3 x + (√3 s)/2 - √3 s /4 ) )² = ( √3 s /4 )²

Simplify the y-component:

-√3 x + (√3 s)/2 - √3 s /4 = -√3 x + (√3 s)/4

So:

x² + ( -√3 x + (√3 s)/4 )² = ( 3 s² ) / 16

Let me compute the second term:

( -√3 x + (√3 s)/4 )² = (√3)^2 ( -x + s/4 )² = 3 ( -x + s/4 )²

So:

x² + 3( x - s/4 )² = 3 s² /16

Expand 3(x - s/4)^2:

3( x² - (s/2)x + (s²)/16 )

So:

x² + 3x² - (3s/2)x + (3 s²)/16 = 3 s² /16

Combine terms:

(1 + 3)x² - (3s/2)x + (3 s²)/16 = (3 s²)/16

So 4x² - (3s/2)x + (3 s²)/16 - (3 s²)/16 =0



---------------

Wait, subtract the right-hand side from both sides:

Left side becomes 4x² - (3s/2)x + (3 s²)/16 - 3 s² /16 = 4x² - (3s/2)x = 0

Therefore,

4x² - (3s/2)x =0

Factor:

x (4x - 3s/2) =0

Solutions are x=0 and 4x - 3s/2 =0 => x= (3s/2)/4 = 3s/8.

So the intersection points are at x=0 and x=3s/8.

At x=0, that's point A (0, √3 s /2). The other intersection is at x=3s/8. Let me find the y-coordinate there:

From the triangle's equation: y = -√3*(3s/8) + (√3 s)/2 = - (3√3 s)/8 + (4√3 s)/8 = (√3 s)/8.

So the other intersection point is (3s/8, √3 s /8).

Therefore, on the right side, the circle intersects the triangle at (3s/8, √3 s /8) and at point A. So between x=0 and x=3s/8, the circle is inside the triangle? 

---------------

Wait, no. Wait, let me check at x= s/4, which was the triangle's x at the center's y-coordinate.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the area. The area inside the circle but outside the triangle on the right side would be the area from x=3s/8 to x= maximum x of the circle at that y?



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the area outside the triangle is bounded between the circle and the triangle from x=3s/8 to x= where?



---------------

Wait, actually, from x=0 to x=3s/8, the circle is below the triangle's edge, so inside the triangle. From x=3s/8 onward, up to the circle's edge, the circle is outside the triangle. 

---------------

Wait, let me confirm with a point.

Take x= s/2 (the point C). The triangle's edge is at x= s/2, y=0. The circle at x=s/2 would have:

x² + (y - √3 s /4)^2 = ( √3 s /4 )²

Plugging x = s/2,

(s/2)^2 + (y - √3 s /4)^2 = 3 s² /16

=> s² /4 + (y - √3 s /4)^2 = 3 s² /16

=> (y - √3 s /4)^2 = 3 s² /16 - 4 s² /16 = - s² /16



---------------

Wait, that can't be. So x=s/2 is outside the circle, which we saw earlier. So beyond x=3s/8, the circle is above the triangle?



---------------

Wait, let me pick x= 3s/8. At that point, the circle and triangle meet. Beyond that, moving to the right, the triangle's edge is lower, so the circle is above it? 

---------------

Wait, actually, the triangle's edge at x=3s/8 is at y= √3 s /8. The circle at x=3s/8 has that y-coordinate as the point of intersection. Let me check at x slightly larger than 3s/8, say x= s/2. 

---------------

Wait, but as before, x=s/2 is outside the circle, so the circle ends before that.

Wait, perhaps the circle only goes up to x= √3 s /4 at the center's y-coordinate, which is about 0.433 s, but the triangle at that x-coordinate?



---------------

Wait, let me compute at x= √3 s /4, which is approximately 0.433 s, the y-coordinate on the circle would be?

Using the circle equation at x= √3 s /4,

( (√3 s /4)^2 ) + (y - √3 s /4)^2 = ( √3 s /4 )²

So (√3 s /4)^2 cancels out, so (y - √3 s /4)^2 =0 => y= √3 s /4. So the point is ( √3 s /4, √3 s /4 ). Now, the triangle's edge at x= √3 s /4 is y= -√3*(√3 s /4 ) + (√3 s)/2 = - (3 s /4 ) + (√3 s)/2. 

---------------

Wait, that's messy. Let me compute:

y = -√3 x + (√3 s)/2, so plugging x=√3 s /4,

y = -√3*(√3 s /4) + (√3 s)/2 = - (3 s /4) + (√3 s)/2. Hmm, this is in terms of s, but numerically, if s is 1, then y ≈ -0.75 + 0.866 ≈ 0.116, while the circle's y at that x is √3/4 ≈0.433. So the circle is above the triangle here. So between x=3s/8 and x=√3 s /4, the circle is above the triangle, so that area is outside the triangle but inside the circle.



---------------

Wait, but the intersection point was at x=3s/8, so from x=3s/8 to x=√3 s /4, the circle is above the triangle. Beyond x=√3 s /4, the circle turns back, but since the radius in x is √3 s /4, the maximum x is √3 s /4. 

---------------

Wait, actually, the circle's rightmost point is at x=√3 s /4, y=√3 s /4. So beyond x=√3 s /4, there is no circle.

Therefore, on the right side, the area inside the circle but outside the triangle is the area under the circle from x=3s/8 to x=√3 s /4, above the triangle's edge.

Therefore, to compute this area, we can set up an integral from x=3s/8 to x=√3 s /4 of [circle's y - triangle's y] dx, then double it for both sides, and that would be the total area inside the circle but outside the triangle.



---------------

Alternatively, since it's symmetrical, compute the area on the right side and multiply by 2.

First, let me find expressions for the upper and lower boundaries.

The upper boundary is the circle's curve, and the lower boundary is the triangle's side.

The circle's equation solved for y:

From x² + (y - √3 s /4)^2 = ( √3 s /4 )²,

=> (y - √3 s /4)^2 = ( √3 s /4 )² - x²,

=> y = √3 s /4 + sqrt( (3 s² /16 ) - x² )



---------------

Wait, but since we are dealing with the upper part of the circle (since the lower part is below the triangle?), actually, in this region between x=3s/8 and x=√3 s /4, the circle is above the triangle, so the upper boundary is the circle and the lower boundary is the triangle.



---------------

Wait, actually, at each x in [3s/8, √3 s /4], the vertical slice goes from the triangle's y up to the circle's y.

Therefore, the vertical slice's height is (circle y - triangle y).

Therefore, the area on the right side is integral from x=3s/8 to x=√3 s /4 of [ ( √3 s /4 + sqrt( 3 s² /16 -x² ) ) - ( -√3 x + √3 s /2 ) ] dx



---------------

Wait, hold on. Let me re-derive:

The circle's upper y at a given x is:

y_circle = √3 s /4 + sqrt( ( √3 s /4 )² - x² )



---------------

Wait, actually, expanding:

The equation was (y - √3 s /4)^2 = ( √3 s /4 )² - x²,

so y = √3 s /4 ± sqrt( ( √3 s /4 )² - x² )

But since we are in the upper half of the circle (since the triangle is above the base), we take the positive sqrt, so:

y_circle = √3 s /4 + sqrt( 3 s² /16 - x² )



---------------

Wait, but sqrt( 3 s² /16 -x² ) can be written as (s/4) sqrt(3 - (4x/s)^2 )



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps better to keep as is.

Meanwhile, the triangle's y at that x is y_triangle = -√3 x + (√3 s)/2.

Therefore, the vertical slice's height is:

[ √3 s /4 + sqrt( 3 s² /16 -x² ) ] - [ -√3 x + (√3 s)/2 ]

Simplify this expression:

First, expand the terms:

√3 s /4 + sqrt( 3 s² /16 -x² ) + √3 x - (√3 s)/2

Combine the terms with √3 s:

√3 s /4 - √3 s /2 = - √3 s /4

So the expression becomes:

- (√3 s)/4 + √3 x + sqrt( 3 s² /16 -x² )

Therefore, the integral for the right side area is:

∫ from x=3s/8 to x= (√3 s)/4 [ - (√3 s)/4 + √3 x + sqrt( 3 s² /16 -x² ) ] dx

This integral looks a bit complicated, but maybe we can find a substitution or simplify.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better approach by using sector areas and triangle areas.

Let me think again. The area inside the circle but outside the triangle on the right side is the area between the circle from x=3s/8 to x=√3 s /4, bounded below by the triangle and above by the circle.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe we can compute the area of the circular segment from the intersection point to the top.

The points of intersection are at (3s/8, √3 s /8 ) and point A (0, √3 s /2). 

---------------

Wait, but actually the segment between those two points?

Alternatively, the area can be considered as the area of the sector of the circle defined by the two intersection points minus the area of the triangle formed by those points and the center.

Let me denote the two intersection points as P (3s/8, √3 s /8 ) and A (0, √3 s /2 ). The center of the circle is O (0, √3 s /4 ).

So the sector OAP and the triangle OAP would form the segment.



---------------

Wait, but actually, the area outside the triangle but inside the circle on the right side would be the area between the arc PA and the chord PA, but since the chord PA is part of the triangle?



---------------

Wait, perhaps I need to think of the angle at the center between points P and A.

Let me compute the angle ∠POA.

Coordinates:

Point O is (0, √3 s /4 )

Point A is (0, √3 s /2 )

Point P is (3s/8, √3 s /8 )

Compute vectors OP and OA.

Vector OP: from O to P is (3s/8 -0, √3 s /8 - √3 s /4 ) = (3s/8, -√3 s /8 )

Vector OA: from O to A is (0 -0, √3 s /2 - √3 s /4 ) = (0, √3 s /4 )

The angle between vectors OP and OA can be found using the dot product:

cosθ = (OP • OA) / ( |OP| |OA| )

Compute OP • OA = (3s/8)(0) + (-√3 s /8)(√3 s /4 ) = 0 + ( -3 s² /32 )

|OP| = sqrt( (3s/8)^2 + (-√3 s /8)^2 ) = sqrt( 9 s² /64 + 3 s² /64 ) = sqrt(12 s² /64 ) = (2 s)/ (4 * 2) )? 

---------------

Wait sqrt(12 s² /64 ) = (2 s sqrt(3))/8 = (s sqrt(3))/4



---------------

Wait:

sqrt(9 s²/64 + 3 s² /64 ) = sqrt(12 s² /64 ) = (s /8 ) sqrt(12) = (s /8)(2 sqrt(3)) = (s sqrt(3))/4

Similarly, |OA| is sqrt(0² + (√3 s /4 )² ) = √3 s /4

Therefore,

cosθ = ( -3 s² /32 ) / ( (s sqrt(3)/4 )( √3 s /4 ) )

Compute denominator:

(s sqrt(3)/4)(√3 s /4 ) = (3 s² ) /16

So cosθ = ( -3 s² /32 ) / ( 3 s² /16 ) ) = ( -3/32 ) / (3/16 ) = - (1/2 )

Therefore, θ = arccos(-1/2 ) = 120 degrees, or 2π/3 radians.

Therefore, the angle between vectors OP and OA is 120 degrees.

Therefore, the sector area corresponding to this angle is (1/2) r² θ = (1/2)( ( √3 s /4 )² )( 2π/3 )

Compute that:

(1/2)( 3 s² /16 )( 2π /3 ) = (1/2)( 3 s² /16 )( 2π/3 ) = ( s² /16 )( π ) = π s² /16



---------------

Wait, let me recheck:

Sector area formula: (1/2) r² θ

r = √3 s /4,

θ = 2π/3,

so:

(1/2)*( 3 s² /16 )*(2π/3) = (1/2)*(3/16)*(2π/3)*s² = ( (1/2)*(2π/16) )*s² = ( π/16 ) s². Yes, that's correct.

Now, the area of triangle OAP.

Points O (0, √3 s /4 ), A (0, √3 s /2 ), and P (3s/8, √3 s /8 ).

We can compute the area using coordinates.

The area is 1/2 | (x_O(y_A - y_P) + x_A(y_P - y_O) + x_P(y_O - y_A) ) |

But since points O and A are on the y-axis, this simplifies.



---------------

Alternatively, since OA is vertical, the base OA has length (√3 s /2 - √3 s /4 ) = √3 s /4.

The point P is offset to the right, so the area of triangle OAP can be calculated as 1/2 * base * height, where the base is OA (√3 s /4 ), and the height is the horizontal distance from P to the y-axis, which is 3s/8.

Therefore, area of triangle OAP is 1/2 * (√3 s /4 ) * (3s/8 ) = (3 √3 s² ) / 64

Therefore, the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle gives the area of the circular segment:

Sector area - Triangle area = ( π s² /16 ) - ( 3√3 s² /64 )

Therefore, the area on the right side outside the triangle but inside the circle is this segment area: π s² /16 - 3√3 s² /64

Since there are two such segments (on both the left and right sides), the total area is 2*( π s² /16 - 3√3 s² /64 ) = ( π s² /8 - 3√3 s² /32 )



---------------

Wait, but hold on. Is this the entire area outside the triangle? Wait, actually, in the previous calculation, we considered the area on the right side as the segment between points O, A, and P. But actually, the region outside the triangle but inside the circle is the area between the circle and the triangle from point P to the edge of the circle. 

---------------

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation here.

Wait, the segment area (sector minus triangle) is the area between the chord PA and the arc PA. Since the chord PA is part of the triangle's side AC, the area of the segment is exactly the area inside the circle but outside the triangle on that side. Therefore, yes, each side (left and right) has a segment area of ( π s² /16 - 3√3 s² /64 ). Therefore, total area is twice that:

Total Area = 2*( π s² /16 - 3√3 s² /64 ) = π s² /8 - 3√3 s² /32

But also, the problem states that this area is equal to 800π - 600√3. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

π s² /8 - 3√3 s² /32 = 800π - 600√3

To solve for s. Let's write this equation:

(π s²)/8 - (3√3 s²)/32 = 800π - 600√3

Let me factor out s² on the left:

s² [ π/8 - 3√3 /32 ] = 800π - 600√3

Let me get common denominators for the terms in the bracket:

π/8 = 4π/32,

so:

s² [ (4π - 3√3)/32 ] = 800π - 600√3

Multiply both sides by 32:

s² (4π - 3√3) = 32*(800π - 600√3 )

Compute the right-hand side:

32*800π = 25600π,

32*(-600√3 ) = -19200√3,

Thus,

s² (4π - 3√3 ) = 25600π - 19200√3

Hmm, perhaps factor the right-hand side:

Notice that 25600π - 19200√3 can be factored as 3200*(8π - 6√3 ), but maybe not helpful. 

---------------

Alternatively, see if the left and right have a common factor.

Alternatively, let me factor the left side's coefficient:

4π - 3√3 is multiplied by s². Let me see if the right side can be expressed as a multiple of (4π - 3√3):

Suppose 25600π - 19200√3 = k*(4π - 3√3 )

Let me see what k would be:

k*4π =25600π ⇒ k=25600/4 =6400,

Similarly, k*(-3√3 )= -19200√3 ⇒k=19200/3=6400. Perfect, so yes:

25600π - 19200√3 = 6400*(4π - 3√3 )

Therefore,

s²*(4π - 3√3 ) =6400*(4π - 3√3 )

Assuming that 4π - 3√3 ≠0 (which it isn't), we can divide both sides by (4π - 3√3 ), giving:

s² = 6400 ⇒ s=√6400=80.

Therefore, the length of AB is 80.



---------------

Wait, let me verify this.

If s=80,

Compute the area inside the circle but outside the triangle:

Total Area = (π*(80)^2)/8 - (3√3*(80)^2)/32

= (6400π)/8 - (3√3 *6400)/32

= 800π - (19200√3)/32



---------------

Wait, 3*6400=19200, so 19200/32=600. So,

=800π - 600√3, which matches the given area. Perfect.

Therefore, the answer is 80.

**Final Answer**
Answer: 80


Let \(ABC\) be an equilateral triangle with side length \(s\). Denote \(D\) as the midpoint of \(\overline{BC}\), so \(BD = DC = \frac{s}{2}\). The circle \(\Omega\) with diameter \(AD\) has its center at the midpoint of \(AD\) and radius \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}s\). 

The area of circle \(\Omega\) is:
\[
\pi \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}s \right)^2 = \frac{3\pi}{16}s^2
\]

The region inside \(\Omega\) but outside \(\triangle ABC\) is the area of the circle minus the overlapping area with the triangle. The overlapping area consists of two segments of the circle. 

The angle \(\theta\) between the vectors from the center \(O\) to points \(A\) and \(P\) (where \(P\) is the intersection of the circle and the triangle's side) is \(120^\circ\) or \(\frac{2\pi}{3}\) radians. The area of the sector formed by this angle is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}s \right)^2 \cdot \frac{2\pi}{3} = \frac{\pi s^2}{16}
\]

The area of triangle \(OAP\) is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}s \cdot \frac{3s}{8} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}s^2}{64}
\]

The area of one segment is:
\[
\frac{\pi s^2}{16} - \frac{3\sqrt{3}s^2}{64}
\]

Since there are two such segments, the total overlapping area is:
\[
2 \left( \frac{\pi s^2}{16} - \frac{3\sqrt{3}s^2}{64} \right) = \frac{\pi s^2}{8} - \frac{3\sqrt{3}s^2}{32}
\]

The area inside \(\Omega\) but outside \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
\frac{3\pi s^2}{16} - \left( \frac{\pi s^2}{8} - \frac{3\sqrt{3}s^2}{32} \right) = \frac{\pi s^2}{16} + \frac{3\sqrt{3}s^2}{32}
\]

Given this area is \(800\pi - 600\sqrt{3}\), we set up the equation:
\[
\frac{\pi s^2}{8} - \frac{3\sqrt{3}s^2}{32} = 800\pi - 600\sqrt{3}
\]

Solving for \(s\):
\[
s^2 \left( \frac{\pi}{8} - \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{32} \right) = 800\pi - 600\sqrt{3}
\]
\[
s^2 = \frac{800\pi - 600\sqrt{3}}{\frac{\pi}{8} - \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{32}} = 6400
\]
\[
s = \sqrt{6400} = 80
\]
