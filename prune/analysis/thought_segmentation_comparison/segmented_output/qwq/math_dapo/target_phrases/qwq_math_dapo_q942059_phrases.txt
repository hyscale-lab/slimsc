Okay, so I need to find the number of bad integers between 100 and 200 that are congruent to 3 mod 4. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. 

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. A "bad" integer is one that can't be turned into a valid time on a 12-hour digital clock by inserting a colon somewhere in its digits. A "good" one can be. For example, 100 is good because you can write 1:00, but 164 is bad because inserting a colon anywhere (like 1:64 or 16:4) isn't a valid time. 

The task is to count how many numbers between 100 and 200 (so from 100 up to 199, since 200 is excluded because it's not less than 200? 

---------------

Wait, actually, the problem says between 100 and 200, so does that include 200? Hmm, the wording says "between 100 and 200", which sometimes can be ambiguous. But since the example given is 100 and 164, and 200 is mentioned as an example, maybe they mean up to 199? Let me check the problem again. It says "between 100 and 200", so probably 100 ≤ x ≤ 199. Since 200 would be a three-digit number starting with 2, but on a 12-hour clock, the hours go up to 12, so numbers starting with 2 would have to be 12, so 200 might not be considered here. So maybe we are dealing with numbers from 100 to 199 inclusive. 

Also, the numbers need to be equivalent to 3 mod 4. So first, I need to consider all numbers between 100 and 199 that are 3 mod 4, then among those, determine which are "bad" (i.e., cannot form a valid time by inserting a colon). 

Let me start by figuring out which numbers between 100-199 are congruent to 3 mod 4. 

First, numbers between 100 and 199: all are three-digit numbers starting with 1. So they are of the form 1AB, where A and B are digits (0-9). 

First, let's find all numbers 1AB where 1AB ≡ 3 mod 4. 

To compute 1AB mod 4, note that 100 mod 4 is 0 (since 100 is divisible by 4). So 1AB mod 4 is equal to (10*A + B) mod 4. Because 100 ≡ 0 mod4, so 100 + 10A + B ≡ 10A + B mod4. 

Therefore, 10A + B ≡ 3 mod4. 

So, for each number 1AB (from 100 to 199), the last two digits (the tens and units place) must form a number (10A + B) that is congruent to 3 mod4. 

Therefore, the problem reduces to first listing all numbers from 100 to 199 where the last two digits form a number (from 00 to 99) that is ≡3 mod4. 

Then, among those numbers, we need to find which are "bad"—meaning you can't insert a colon to make a valid time. 

So first step: list all numbers 1AB where 10A + B ≡3 mod4. 

Second step: for each such number, check if it's possible to insert a colon to form a valid time. If not, count it as bad. 

Then, total bad numbers in that set will be the answer. 

First, let's tackle the first part: identifying all numbers between 100-199 where the last two digits (the number formed by the tens and units digit) ≡3 mod4. 

Let me note that 10A + B ≡3 mod4. Since A and B are digits (0-9), 10A + B can be from 0 to 99. 

So, 10A + B ≡3 mod4. 

We can write 10A + B ≡ 2A + B mod4 (since 10 ≡ 2 mod4, so 10A mod4 = (2A mod4), so 10A + B mod4 = (2A + B) mod4). 

Therefore, 2A + B ≡3 mod4. 

So, for each A (0-9) and B (0-9), if 2A + B ≡3 mod4, then the number 1AB is in our set. 



---------------

Alternatively, for each A from 0 to 9, B must satisfy B ≡ (3 - 2A) mod4. 

So for each A, possible B values are those that are congruent to (3 - 2A) mod4. Since B is a digit (0-9), there will be 2 or 3 possible B's for each A. 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to iterate through all possible A and B. 

But maybe first, let's compute for each A from 0 to 9:

Let me list A from 0 to 9, and for each A, find B such that 2A + B ≡3 mod4. 

Starting with A=0:

A=0: 2*0 + B ≡3 mod4 ⇒ B ≡3 mod4 ⇒ B can be 3,7 (since 3 mod4 and 7 mod4 is 3). 



---------------

Wait, 3 mod4 is 3, 7 mod4 is 3. So B can be 3,7. 

But B is a digit, so 3,7. 

A=0, possible B: 3,7. 

A=1:

2*1 + B ≡3 mod4 ⇒ 2 + B ≡3 ⇒ B ≡1 mod4 ⇒ B can be 1,5,9. 

Since B is 0-9, so 1,5,9. 

A=2:

2*2 + B =4 + B ≡0 + B mod4 (since 4 mod4 is 0). So 0 + B ≡3 mod4 ⇒ B≡3 mod4 ⇒ same as A=0. So B=3,7.

A=3:

2*3 + B =6 + B. 6 mod4 is 2, so 2 + B ≡3 mod4 ⇒ B ≡1 mod4 ⇒ B=1,5,9.

A=4:

2*4 =8, 8 mod4 is 0. So 0 + B ≡3 ⇒ B≡3 mod4 ⇒ B=3,7.

A=5:

2*5 =10 mod4 is 2. So 2 + B ≡3 ⇒ B≡1 mod4 ⇒ B=1,5,9.

A=6:

2*6=12 mod4 is 0. 0 + B ≡3 ⇒ B≡3 mod4 ⇒ B=3,7.

A=7:

2*7=14 mod4 is 2. 2 + B ≡3 ⇒ B≡1 mod4 ⇒ B=1,5,9.

A=8:

2*8=16 mod4 is 0. 0 + B ≡3 ⇒ B≡3 mod4 ⇒ B=3,7.

A=9:

2*9=18 mod4 is 2 (since 18 divided by 4 is 4*4=16, remainder 2). So 2 + B ≡3 ⇒ B≡1 mod4 ⇒ B=1,5,9.

So summarizing:

For each A from 0-9, possible B's:

A=0: B=3,7

A=1: B=1,5,9

A=2: B=3,7

A=3: B=1,5,9

A=4: B=3,7

A=5: B=1,5,9

A=6: B=3,7

A=7: B=1,5,9

A=8: B=3,7

A=9: B=1,5,9

Therefore, for each A, the number of B's is either 2 or 3. 

So total numbers in the set (1AB where 10A+B ≡3 mod4) would be:

For A even (0,2,4,6,8): each has 2 B's ⇒ 5 A's *2 =10

For A odd (1,3,5,7,9): each has 3 B's ⇒5 A's *3=15

Total numbers: 10+15=25 numbers. 



---------------

Wait, let me check:

A=0: 2

A=1:3

A=2:2

A=3:3

A=4:2

A=5:3

A=6:2

A=7:3

A=8:2

A=9:3

Adding those up: (2+3)*5 = 5*5=25? 

---------------

Wait, 2+3 is 5, times 5? Wait, no, actually there are 10 A's, so 5 even and 5 odd. So yes, 5*(2+3)=25. 

Therefore, there are 25 numbers between 100 and 199 that are ≡3 mod4. 

Now, among these 25 numbers, we need to find which are "bad"—i.e., cannot have a colon inserted to form a valid time on a 12-hour clock. 

First, let me recall that on a 12-hour digital clock, the time is displayed as H:MM, where H is from 1 to 12, and MM is from 00 to 59. However, since we are dealing with numbers between 100 and 199, which are three-digit numbers starting with 1, inserting a colon would split them into either 1:AB or 1A:B, where A and B are digits. 



---------------

Wait, let's clarify: the number is 1AB (three digits). To form a time, we can insert a colon either after the first digit (making 1:AB) or after the second digit (making 1A:B). 

Therefore, for each number 1AB, we can check both possibilities:

1. Split as 1:AB. This would mean the hour is 1, and the minutes are AB. To be valid, the minutes (AB) must be between 00 and 59. Since A is the tens digit of the minutes, A must be 0-5. Because if the minutes are AB, then A (the second digit of the original number) must be between 0 and 5 (since minutes can't be 60-99). 

2. Split as 1A:B. Here, the hour is 1A (the first two digits) and the minutes are B (the third digit). The hour must be between 1 and 12. Since the first digit is 1, the hour is 1 followed by A. So the hour is 10 + A (since it's the digits '1' and 'A'). Therefore, the hour must be between 1 and 12. Since the first digit is 1, the maximum hour is 19 (if A=9), but 19 is over 12, so actually, the hour can be from 10 to 19, but on a 12-hour clock, the hours go up to 12. So the hour (1A) must be between 1 and 12. Since it's 1 followed by A, the possible values are 10,11,12 (since 1 followed by 0 is 10, 1 is 11, 2 is 12; beyond that, like 13 would be 1 followed by 3, but 13 is over 12). 



---------------

Wait, so for the hour part when splitting as 1A:B, the hour is the first two digits: 1A. Since the original number starts with 1, the first two digits are 1 and A. So the hour is 10 + A. Therefore, to be a valid hour, 10 + A must be between 1 and 12. 

But since 10 + A must be at least 10 (since A is a digit 0-9), the possible values of the hour (1A) are 10, 11, or 12. So:

- If A is 0: 10 (valid)
- If A is 1: 11 (valid)
- If A is 2: 12 (valid)
- If A is 3-9: 13-19, which are invalid on a 12-hour clock. 

Therefore, when splitting as 1A:B, the hour is valid only if A is 0,1, or 2. Additionally, the minutes part (B) must be between 00 and 59. Since B is a single digit, the minutes would be 0-9, which is okay (since 0-9 minutes are valid; but actually, minutes must be two digits, so if we split as 1A:B, then the minutes would be just B, but on a clock, minutes are two digits, so perhaps that's an issue? 

---------------

Wait, hold on. 

Wait, the problem says "insert a colon among the digits to form a time of day on a twelve-hour digital clock". A digital clock would display times like 1:00, 12:34, etc. So minutes must be two digits. Therefore, if you split as 1A:B, the minutes would only be one digit (just B), which is invalid because minutes need to be two digits. Therefore, actually, splitting as 1A:B would only be valid if the minutes part is two digits, but since the original number is three digits, inserting a colon after the second digit gives 1A:B, which is H:MM where H is 1A (two digits) and MM is B (one digit). Since MM must be two digits, that's invalid. 

---------------

Wait, but maybe leading zeros are allowed? 

Wait, on a digital clock, single-digit minutes are displayed with a leading zero, like 1:05. So perhaps when splitting as 1A:B, the minutes would be "B" but written as "0B". But the original number is 1AB, so inserting a colon after the second digit gives 1A:B, which would be H:MM where H is 1A and MM is B. But since MM is only one digit, that's not valid unless B is considered as 0B. Hmm, but the problem says "insert a colon among the digits", so you can't add a zero. You have to use the digits as they are. 

Therefore, splitting as 1A:B would result in minutes being a single digit, which is invalid because the minutes must be two digits. Therefore, that split is invalid unless B is actually two digits, but since it's a single digit, that's not possible. 



---------------

Wait, maybe I need to check the problem's example again. The example given is 100 is good because you can write 1:00. So inserting the colon after the first digit: 1:00. The minutes here are 00, which is two digits. 

Similarly, if you have a number like 123, inserting a colon after the first digit would be 1:23 (valid), or after the second digit would be 12:3, which is invalid because minutes are only 3, not two digits. So, only the first split is valid here. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that when inserting a colon, the minutes must be two digits. Therefore, for the split 1A:B, the minutes would only be one digit (B), so that's invalid. Therefore, the only valid split is when the minutes are two digits, meaning the colon is inserted after the first digit (resulting in H:MM where H is 1 and MM is AB), or after the second digit but only if the minutes part is two digits. 

---------------

Wait, but inserting after the second digit gives the minutes as the third digit, which is one digit. Therefore, the only valid splits are either:

1. 1:AB (so the minutes are AB, two digits), which requires that AB is between 00 and 59. 

2. 1A:B (the hour is 1A, which must be between 1 and 12, and the minutes are B, but since minutes must be two digits, this is only valid if B is two digits, which it's not. Therefore, this split is invalid. 



---------------

Wait, but the problem says "insert a colon among the digits", so perhaps leading zeros are allowed? For example, if the number is 110, inserting after the second digit gives 11:0, which could be interpreted as 11:00? But the original number is 110, so inserting a colon would be 11:0, but that's not the same as 11:00. Since you can't add a zero. So minutes have to be exactly the digits after the colon. 

Therefore, in order for the split after the second digit (1A:B) to be valid, the minutes must be two digits, so B must be two digits? But B is a single digit. Therefore, that split is invalid. Therefore, only the first split (1:AB) is a possible valid time, except when the hour part is 1A (if that is a valid hour, but with minutes being two digits). 

---------------

Wait, maybe there's another way. Wait, if the number is, say, 123, inserting a colon after the first digit gives 1:23 (valid), inserting after the second gives 12:3 (invalid). But if the number is 102, inserting after the second digit gives 10:2, which is invalid because minutes are 02 (if you consider leading zero, but the original number's digits are 1,0,2, so inserting after the second digit would be 10:2, which is 10:02 if we add a leading zero? But the problem states "insert a colon among the digits"—so you can't add digits, only insert the colon. So 10:2 would have minutes as "2", which is one digit, so invalid. 

Therefore, the only valid way to form a time is to split after the first digit, giving H:MM where H is 1, and MM is the last two digits (AB). 



---------------

Alternatively, if the number is such that splitting after the second digit gives a valid hour (between 1-12) and the minutes part is two digits? 

---------------

Wait, but the minutes part would only be one digit. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think again. 

Suppose the number is 123. Inserting after the first digit gives 1:23 (valid). Inserting after the second digit gives 12:3. But 12 is a valid hour, but 3 is only one digit for minutes. Since minutes must be two digits, 12:3 is invalid. 

However, if the number is 112, inserting after the second digit gives 11:2. Again, minutes are one digit. 



---------------

Wait, but maybe if the minutes part is a single digit, but leading zero is assumed? Like 12:3 would be 12:03. However, the problem states that you have to insert a colon among the digits, so you can't add a zero. Therefore, the minutes must be exactly the digits after the colon. 

Therefore, the only valid splits are those where the minutes are two digits, so the colon must be placed such that the minutes part is two digits. Since the original number is three digits, the only way to have two digits for minutes is to split after the first digit (so the first digit is the hour, next two are minutes). 



---------------

Alternatively, if the hour part is two digits (like 12), then the minutes part would be the third digit, but that's only one digit, so invalid. 

Therefore, the only possible valid time is when splitting after the first digit, resulting in 1:AB, which requires that AB is between 00 and 59. 



---------------

Wait, but there is another possibility: if the number is between 100-199, the hour could be 10, 11, or 12, right? For example, the number 123 could also be split as 12:3, but that's invalid because minutes are one digit, but 12:03 would be different. 

---------------

Alternatively, maybe the problem allows leading zeros in the minutes? 

Wait, let me check the problem's example again. The example given is 100 is good because we can write 1:00. That uses the first split: 1:00. The other split would be 10:0, which is 10 hours and 0 minutes, but written as 10:0, but on a digital clock, it would be 10:00, but you can't add the zero. Therefore, the problem requires that the digits as split form a valid time without adding digits. 

Therefore, the split 10:0 would be 10 hours and 0 minutes, which would be written as 10:0, but since minutes must be two digits, that's invalid. Therefore, only splits where the minutes are two digits are valid, which requires the colon to be after the first digit. 

Therefore, the only valid splits are those where the first digit is the hour (1, 2, ..., 9, but since the number starts with 1, it's only 1), and the next two digits are minutes (00-59). 

---------------

Alternatively, if the hour is two digits (like 10, 11, 12), then the minutes must be two digits, so the number would have to have four digits? 

---------------

Wait, no, the numbers are three-digit, so inserting a colon after the first digit gives one digit hour and two digits minutes. Inserting after the second digit gives two digits hour and one digit minutes. Since the hour can be up to 12, but the two-digit hour would need to be 10, 11, or 12. 



---------------

Wait, perhaps the problem allows leading zeros for the hour? For example, if the number is 001, but since we're only considering numbers between 100 and 200, leading zeros aren't an issue here. 



---------------

Wait, maybe my initial conclusion is too restrictive. Let me think again. 

Suppose the number is 123. 

Possible splits:

1:23 (valid, since 1 is hour, 23 minutes)

12:3 (invalid, since minutes must be two digits, but here it's one digit)

So only the first split is valid. 



---------------

Another example, 110:

Split as 1:10 (valid), or 11:0 (invalid, minutes are one digit). So valid. 



---------------

Another example, 102:

Split as 1:02 (valid), or 10:2 (invalid). So valid. 



---------------

Another example, 1234 is a four-digit number, but we're dealing with three-digit numbers. 

Wait, what about a number like 129? 

Split as 1:29 (valid), or 12:9 (invalid). 

What about 109? 

1:09 or 10:9 (invalid). 

What about 130? 

---------------

Wait, 130 is between 100-199, but 130: inserting after first digit is 1:30 (valid), so it's good. 



---------------

Wait, but 130 is 1 followed by 3 and 0, so splitting after first digit gives 1:30 which is valid. 

Now, what about a number like 160? 

1:60. 

---------------

Wait, minutes can't be 60. So 1:60 is invalid. So inserting after first digit gives invalid, inserting after second digit gives 16:0, which is invalid (hour 16 is too big, and minutes 0 is one digit). Therefore, 160 would be bad? 

---------------

Wait, but 160 mod4? Let me check. 

Wait, but in our problem, we are only considering numbers ≡3 mod4. Let's see. 160 divided by 4 is 40, so 160 mod4 is 0. So it's not in our set. 

But let's take an example from our set. Let's take a number in the set (≡3 mod4). Let's say 103. 

103 mod4: 103 divided by 4 is 25*4 + 3, so yes, 3 mod4. 

Now, check if it's good or bad. 

Split after first digit: 1:03 (valid). So it's good. 



---------------

Another example: 111. Wait, 111 mod4: 111 mod4 is 3 (since 112 is divisible by 4, so 111 mod4 is 3). 

Split after first digit: 1:11 (valid). So good. 



---------------

Another example: 133. Let's see 133 mod4: 133 - 132=1, so 1 mod4? 

---------------

Wait, 132 is divisible by 4? 4*33=132, so 133 mod4 is 1. Not 3. 



---------------

Wait maybe 115. 115 mod4: 115 divided by 4 is 28*4=112, 115-112=3 ⇒ 3 mod4. 

Split after first digit: 1:15 (valid). So good. 

Hmm, so some numbers in the set are good. 

Now, the bad numbers are those where neither split gives a valid time. 

So, to be bad, both splits must be invalid. 

So, for a number 1AB:

Case 1: Split as 1:AB (hour 1, minutes AB). To be invalid, AB must not be between 00 and 59. Since AB is the last two digits (from 00 to 99), AB must be >=60. 

Case 2: Split as 1A:B (hour 1A, minutes B). To be invalid, either:

- Hour 1A is not between 1 and 12, or

- Minutes B is not between 00 and 59 (but since minutes must be two digits, actually, this split is invalid because minutes are only one digit. 

---------------

Wait, but as discussed earlier, minutes need to be two digits, so this split is automatically invalid unless we can have leading zeros, which we can't. 



---------------

Wait, actually, even if the hour is valid (10,11,12), the minutes part is only one digit, which is invalid. Therefore, the split after the second digit is always invalid for forming a valid time on a digital clock. 

Therefore, the only possible valid split is the first one (1:AB). Therefore, a number is good if AB is between 00 and 59, and bad otherwise. 



---------------

Wait, that seems to be the case. So, if the last two digits (AB) form a number from 00 to 59, then the number is good. If AB is 60-99, then it's bad. 

Therefore, the bad numbers in our set (≡3 mod4) are those where AB (the last two digits) is 60-99. 

Therefore, to find the bad numbers in the set, we need to look at numbers 1AB where:

1. 10A + B ≡3 mod4 (so they are in our initial set)

AND

2. AB (i.e., 10A + B) ≥60. 

Therefore, the problem reduces to counting how many numbers 1AB (between 100-199) satisfy both:

- 10A + B ≡3 mod4,

AND

- 10A + B ≥60. 

Therefore, the steps now are:

1. From our earlier list of numbers where 10A + B ≡3 mod4 (total 25 numbers), count how many have AB (i.e., 10A + B) ≥60. 



---------------

Alternatively, since we can represent AB as the number formed by the last two digits (from 00 to 99), so 10A + B is the value of those two digits. So for each number in the set (the 25 numbers), check if 10A + B ≥60. 



---------------

Alternatively, since we already categorized the possible A and B for each case, perhaps we can compute this without enumerating all 25 numbers. 

Let me think. 

First, note that AB (the last two digits) is from 00 to 99. 

We need to find numbers where AB ≥60 and AB ≡3 mod4. 

So the total numbers in the set (≡3 mod4) with AB >=60 is equal to the numbers between 60 and 99 inclusive that are ≡3 mod4, and then considering their A and B values (since A is the tens digit and B is the units digit). 



---------------

Wait, but since we have already characterized the A and B for each case, maybe it's better to compute how many of the 25 numbers have AB >=60. 



---------------

Alternatively, let's compute for each A from 0 to9, the possible B's that satisfy 2A + B ≡3 mod4 and 10A + B >=60. 

So let's go back to each A from 0-9 and see for each A, how many B's satisfy both conditions. 

Starting with A=0:

A=0: B must be 3 or7 (from earlier). 

AB = 03 (3) or 07 (7). Both are less than 60. So none qualify. 

A=1:

B can be 1,5,9. 

AB is 11, 15, 19. All less than 60. None qualify. 

A=2:

B can be 3 or7. 

AB is 23 or 27. Both <60. 

A=3:

B can be 1,5,9. 

AB is 31, 35, 39. All <60. 

A=4:

B can be 3 or7. 

AB is 43 or 47. Both <60. 

A=5:

B can be 1,5,9. 

AB is 51,55,59. 

Now, 51,55,59: all are less than 60 except 59 is still 59. 

---------------

Wait, 59 is still less than 60. So none here qualify. 

Wait, 51,55,59 are all below 60. So A=5 gives no qualifying B's. 



---------------

Wait, moving on. 

A=6:

B can be 3 or7. 

AB is 63 or 67. 

63 and 67 are both ≥60. So for A=6, B=3 and7 both qualify. 

So that's 2 numbers here. 

A=7:

B can be 1,5,9. 

AB is 71,75,79. All are ≥60. 

So for A=7, all three B's (1,5,9) qualify. 

Thus, 3 numbers here. 

A=8:

B can be 3 or7. 

AB is 83 or87. Both are ≥60. 

Thus, 2 numbers here. 

A=9:

B can be 1,5,9. 

AB is 91,95,99. All are ≥60. 

Thus, 3 numbers here. 

So now, let's tally up the counts for each A:

A=0: 0

A=1:0

A=2:0

A=3:0

A=4:0

A=5:0

A=6:2

A=7:3

A=8:2

A=9:3

Total bad numbers: 2 +3 +2 +3 =10. 



---------------

Wait, let me check again:

A=6:2

A=7:3 → total so far 5

A=8:2 → 7

A=9:3 → total 10. 

Yes. 

Therefore, there are 10 numbers in the set (≡3 mod4 between 100-199) that have AB >=60, hence are bad. 



---------------

Wait but let me confirm with actual examples. 

Take A=6, B=3: the number is 163. 

Check AB=63, which is 63 >=60. 

Split as 1:63 → minutes 63 is invalid (since minutes can't be over 59). 

Split as 16:3 → invalid because minutes are single digit. So yes, 163 is bad. 

Similarly, A=6,B=7: 167 → AB=67 >=60. 1:67 invalid, 16:7 invalid. Bad. 

A=7,B=1 →171 → AB=71. 1:71 invalid, 17:1 invalid (hour 17 is over 12). 

---------------

Wait, hold on! Wait, here is a problem. 

Wait, when we considered the split after the second digit (1A:B), the hour is 1A. For A=7, 1A is 17, which is over 12, so that split is invalid. 

But even if the minutes were two digits, the hour is invalid. 



---------------

Wait, but in our earlier analysis, we said that the split after the second digit is invalid because the minutes are only one digit. 

However, even if the minutes were two digits (which they are not here), the hour would be 17 which is over 12. 

Therefore, even if the minutes were two digits, the hour is still invalid. 

But in this case, the minutes are single digit, so it's invalid either way. 

But in any case, the only possible valid split is 1:AB, which for AB=71 is invalid because 71 minutes is too much. So yes, 171 is bad. 

Similarly, A=7, B=5: 175 → AB=75. 1:75 invalid. 

A=7,B=9 →179 → same. 

A=8,B=3 →183 → AB=83. 1:83 invalid. 

A=8,B=7 →187 → AB=87 invalid. 

A=9,B=1 →191 → AB=91 invalid. 

A=9,B=5 →195 → AB=95 invalid. 

A=9,B=9 →199 → AB=99 invalid. 

All these numbers are indeed bad. 

So total of 10 numbers. 



---------------

Wait, but let me check A=5. 

Earlier, for A=5, B can be 1,5,9. 

AB would be 51,55,59. All less than 60, so they are good. 

Similarly, A=6,B=3 and7: 63 and67. Those are the first ones over 60. 

Therefore, the total count is indeed 2+3+2+3=10. 

Therefore, the answer should be 10. 

But let me just cross-verify once more by listing all 25 numbers and then counting those with AB >=60. 

First, let's list all 25 numbers. 

Starting with A=0:

A=0:

B=3 → 103

B=7 → 107

A=1:

B=1 →111

B=5 →115

B=9 →119

A=2:

B=3 →123

B=7 →127

A=3:

B=1 →131

B=5 →135

B=9 →139

A=4:

B=3 →143

B=7 →147

A=5:

B=1 →151

B=5 →155

B=9 →159

A=6:

B=3 →163

B=7 →167

A=7:

B=1 →171

B=5 →175

B=9 →179

A=8:

B=3 →183

B=7 →187

A=9:

B=1 →191

B=5 →195

B=9 →199

So that's 25 numbers. 

Now, let's go through each and see if they are bad (i.e., AB >=60):

103: AB=03 → 3 <60 → good

107: AB=07 →7 <60 → good

111: 11 <60 → good

115:15 <60 → good

119:19 <60 → good

123:23 <60 → good

127:27 <60 → good

131:31 <60 → good

135:35 <60 → good

139:39 <60 → good

143:43 <60 → good

147:47 <60 → good

151:51 <60 → good

155:55 <60 → good

159:59 <60 → good

163:63 ≥60 → bad

167:67 ≥60 → bad

171:71 ≥60 → bad

175:75 ≥60 → bad

179:79 ≥60 → bad

183:83 ≥60 → bad

187:87 ≥60 → bad

191:91 ≥60 → bad

195:95 ≥60 → bad

199:99 ≥60 → bad

Now, count the bad ones:

Starting from 163 onward:

163,167,171,175,179,183,187,191,195,199 → that's 10 numbers. 

Yes, exactly 10. 

Therefore, the answer is 10. 

**Final Answer**
Answer: 10


To determine the number of bad integers between 100 and 199 that are equivalent to 3 mod 4, we first identify all such numbers. A number \(1AB\) (where \(A\) and \(B\) are digits) is congruent to 3 mod 4 if \(10A + B \equiv 3 \pmod{4}\). This simplifies to \(2A + B \equiv 3 \pmod{4}\). 

We analyze each possible value of \(A\) (0-9) to find valid \(B\) values:

- For \(A = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8\), \(B\) must be 3 or 7.
- For \(A = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9\), \(B\) must be 1, 5, or 9.

This results in 25 numbers. Next, we check if these numbers are "bad" by ensuring they cannot form a valid time when inserting a colon. A valid time must have minutes between 00 and 59 when split as \(1:AB\). Thus, a number is bad if \(AB \geq 60\).

Checking each number:
- Numbers with \(A = 6, 7, 8, 9\) and corresponding \(B\) values yield \(AB \geq 60\).

Counting these:
- \(A = 6\): 163, 167 (2 numbers)
- \(A = 7\): 171, 175, 179 (3 numbers)
- \(A = 8\): 183, 187 (2 numbers)
- \(A = 9\): 191, 195, 199 (3 numbers)

Total bad numbers: \(2 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 10\).
