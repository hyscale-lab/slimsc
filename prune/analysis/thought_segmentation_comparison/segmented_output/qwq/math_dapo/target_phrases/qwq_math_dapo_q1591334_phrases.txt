Okay, so I have this problem here: Given a complex number z with |z|=1, find the maximum value of |z³ + z² -5z +3|. The answer needs to be in the form m√3/n, and then I have to find m + n. Hmm, alright. Let me think step by step.

First, since |z| =1, that means z lies on the unit circle in the complex plane. So z can be written in the form e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Maybe I can express z as cosθ + i sinθ, using Euler's formula. That might help me convert the problem into trigonometric functions, which I can then maximize.



---------------

Alternatively, since |z|=1, I know that z̄ = 1/z. Maybe that's useful? Not sure yet. Let me see.

The expression we need to maximize is |z³ + z² -5z +3|. Hmm. Since it's a modulus, maybe I can rewrite this expression in terms of z and its conjugate? Or perhaps use some properties of complex numbers on the unit circle.



---------------

Another thought: since |z|=1, then z^{-1} = \overline{z}, so maybe we can manipulate the expression to include terms like z + \overline{z} or z - \overline{z}, which relate to cosine and sine.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe we can parametrize z as e^{iθ} and substitute into the expression, then compute the modulus squared to turn it into a real function which can be maximized.

Let me try that approach. Let me set z = e^{iθ}, so z³ = e^{i3θ}, z² = e^{i2θ}, and so on. Then the expression becomes:

|e^{i3θ} + e^{i2θ} -5e^{iθ} +3|.

To find the modulus of this complex number, I can write it as the square root of the sum of squares of the real and imaginary parts. But maybe it's easier to compute the square of the modulus, which is easier to handle. Let me denote the expression inside as E = z³ + z² -5z +3, then |E|² = E * \overline{E}. Since |z|=1, \overline{z} = 1/z, so \overline{E} = \overline{z³} + \overline{z²} -5 \overline{z} +3 = z^{-3} + z^{-2} -5 z^{-1} +3.

Therefore, |E|² = (z³ + z² -5z +3)(z^{-3} + z^{-2} -5 z^{-1} +3). Hmm, that might be complicated, but perhaps expanding it could lead to simplifications.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe expanding the original expression in terms of trigonometric functions. Let's try that.

Let z = cosθ + i sinθ. Then z² = cos2θ + i sin2θ, z³ = cos3θ + i sin3θ. So substituting into the expression:

E = (cos3θ + i sin3θ) + (cos2θ + i sin2θ) -5(cosθ + i sinθ) +3.

So the real part is cos3θ + cos2θ -5cosθ +3, and the imaginary part is sin3θ + sin2θ -5 sinθ.

Therefore, |E|² = [cos3θ + cos2θ -5cosθ +3]^2 + [sin3θ + sin2θ -5 sinθ]^2.

Hmm, that's a bit messy, but maybe we can use trigonometric identities to simplify.

First, let me compute the real part:

Real = cos3θ + cos2θ -5cosθ +3.

Similarly, imaginary part:

Imaginary = sin3θ + sin2θ -5 sinθ.

Let me see if I can combine the trigonometric terms. For example, cos3θ and cos2θ can be expressed in terms of multiple angles. Let's recall that cos3θ = 4cos³θ - 3cosθ, and cos2θ = 2cos²θ -1. Similarly, sin3θ = 3sinθ -4sin³θ, and sin2θ = 2sinθ cosθ.

Maybe substituting these expressions into Real and Imaginary parts will help.

Starting with Real part:

cos3θ + cos2θ -5cosθ +3 = [4cos³θ -3cosθ] + [2cos²θ -1] -5cosθ +3

Let me compute term by term:

4cos³θ -3cosθ + 2cos²θ -1 -5cosθ +3

Combine like terms:

4cos³θ + 2cos²θ + (-3cosθ -5cosθ) + (-1 +3)

So that's:

4cos³θ + 2cos²θ -8cosθ +2.

Similarly, the imaginary part:

sin3θ + sin2θ -5 sinθ = [3sinθ -4sin³θ] + [2sinθ cosθ] -5 sinθ

Compute term by term:

3sinθ -4sin³θ + 2sinθ cosθ -5 sinθ

Combine like terms:

(3sinθ -5 sinθ) + 2sinθ cosθ -4sin³θ

Which is:

-2 sinθ + 2 sinθ cosθ -4 sin³θ.

Hmm, so now the Real part is 4cos³θ + 2cos²θ -8cosθ +2,

Imaginary part is -2 sinθ + 2 sinθ cosθ -4 sin³θ.

Hmm, this still looks complicated, but perhaps we can factor some terms here.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I can write everything in terms of cosθ and sinθ, and then express the modulus squared as (Real)^2 + (Imaginary)^2. Let me try that.

Let me denote x = cosθ, y = sinθ, with x² + y² =1.

So Real = 4x³ + 2x² -8x +2,

Imaginary = -2y + 2x y -4y³.

Therefore,

|E|² = (4x³ + 2x² -8x +2)^2 + (-2y + 2x y -4y³)^2.

Hmm, this seems very involved. Maybe there's a smarter way.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps we can notice that z is on the unit circle, so z^3 + z^2 -5 z +3 can be rewritten in terms of lower powers? Since |z|=1, then z^{-1} = \overline{z}, so maybe multiplying numerator and denominator by z^{-3} or something? Not sure.



---------------

Wait, maybe we can consider the polynomial f(z) = z^3 + z^2 -5 z +3. Since |z|=1, we can use the Maximum Modulus Principle, but that might not directly help here. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps we can write f(z) = z^3 + z^2 -5 z +3 and try to find its maximum on the unit circle.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe substitute z = e^{iθ} into f(z) and then compute |f(z)| as a function of θ, then find its maximum.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider writing f(z) as z(z² + z -5) +3, but not sure if that helps.



---------------

Alternatively, think of the expression as a function on the unit circle and use calculus to maximize it. Let me try that approach.

Let me parametrize z = e^{iθ}, so f(θ) = e^{i3θ} + e^{i2θ} -5e^{iθ} +3.

The modulus squared is |f(θ)|² = (Real)^2 + (Imaginary)^2.

Let me compute Real and Imaginary parts again, perhaps using trigonometric identities.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps using complex exponentials:

Let me write f(z) = z^3 + z^2 -5 z +3. Since |z|=1, then z^3 = z^{-(-3)}, but not sure.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe consider the expression f(z) + \overline{f(z)} to get the real part, but not sure.



---------------

Alternatively, think of f(z) as a polynomial and use some transformation.

Alternatively, perhaps consider the problem as an optimization problem on the unit circle. Let me see.

Let me denote w = z, so |w|=1, and we need to maximize |w³ + w² -5w +3|.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps consider the function f(w) = w³ + w² -5w +3, and since we are on the unit circle, maybe we can parametrize w as e^{iθ} and then compute the derivative with respect to θ, set to zero to find critical points.

Yes, that might be a way. Let's try that.

Let me define f(θ) = e^{i3θ} + e^{i2θ} -5e^{iθ} +3. Then |f(θ)| is the modulus, and we need to maximize it over θ.

To find the maximum, we can compute the derivative of |f(θ)|² with respect to θ and set it to zero, since the square of the modulus will attain maximum at the same point.

Compute |f(θ)|² = f(θ) * \overline{f(θ)}. Let me compute f(θ) first.

f(θ) = e^{i3θ} + e^{i2θ} -5e^{iθ} +3,

\overline{f(θ)} = e^{-i3θ} + e^{-i2θ} -5e^{-iθ} +3.

Therefore,

|f(θ)|² = [e^{i3θ} + e^{i2θ} -5e^{iθ} +3][e^{-i3θ} + e^{-i2θ} -5e^{-iθ} +3].

Expanding this product would be quite tedious, but perhaps manageable.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe expanding using trigonometric identities. Let me think again of Real and Imaginary parts.

Earlier, I had expressions for Real and Imaginary parts in terms of cosθ and sinθ. Let me try to compute |E|² again step by step.

Real = 4cos³θ + 2cos²θ -8cosθ +2,

Imaginary = -2 sinθ + 2 sinθ cosθ -4 sin³θ.

Hmm, maybe factor terms in Imaginary part:

Imaginary = -2 sinθ + 2 sinθ cosθ -4 sin³θ

= sinθ(-2 + 2 cosθ -4 sin²θ)

Hmm, but sin²θ = 1 - cos²θ, so substitute that:

= sinθ [ -2 + 2 cosθ -4(1 - cos²θ) ]

= sinθ [ -2 + 2 cosθ -4 + 4 cos²θ ]

= sinθ [4 cos²θ + 2 cosθ -6 ]

Hmm, not sure if that helps.



---------------

Alternatively, let me compute |E|² as (Real)^2 + (Imaginary)^2.

Let me compute Real squared first:

Real^2 = [4cos³θ + 2cos²θ -8cosθ +2]^2.

This is going to be a degree 6 polynomial in cosθ. Similarly, the Imaginary squared term will also be complicated.

This seems too involved. Maybe there is a better way.



---------------

Wait a second. Since |z|=1, perhaps we can write the expression as z^3 + z^2 -5 z +3 = z^3 + z^2 -5 z +3, and note that since z ≠ 0 (since |z|=1), maybe factor out z?



---------------

Wait, z^3 + z^2 -5 z +3 = z(z² + z -5) + 3. Hmm, not sure if that helps.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps consider writing the expression as (z^3 + z^2) + (-5 z +3). Since z is on the unit circle, maybe bound each part?



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps consider specific values of z on the unit circle where the expression might attain maximum. For example, test z=1, z=-1, z=i, etc., and see if those give high values.

Let me try that approach first as a sanity check.

First, let z =1:

Then the expression becomes 1 +1 -5*1 +3 = 1 +1 -5 +3 =0. So |0|=0. Not helpful.

z = -1:

Then (-1)^3 + (-1)^2 -5*(-1) +3 = -1 +1 +5 +3 =8. So |8|=8. Hmm, that's a candidate. But maybe there's a higher value?



---------------

Wait, 8 is already pretty big. Let me check z=i:

z=i: i^3 +i^2 -5i +3 = (-i) + (-1) -5i +3 = (-1 +3) + (-i -5i) = 2 -6i. The modulus is sqrt(2² + (-6)^2) = sqrt(4+36)=sqrt(40)=2√10≈6.324, which is less than 8.

z=-i:

Similarly, (-i)^3 + (-i)^2 -5*(-i) +3 = i + (-1) +5i +3 = ( -1 +3 ) + (i +5i )= 2 +6i. Modulus same as above, 2√10.

How about z= e^{iπ/3} (60 degrees):

cos(π/3)=0.5, sin(π/3)=√3/2. Let's compute:

First, compute z^3: e^{iπ}= -1,

z^2: e^{i2π/3} = cos(2π/3)+i sin(2π/3)= -0.5 + i(√3/2),

-5z: -5*(0.5 +i√3/2)= -2.5 -i(5√3)/2,

+3: +3.

Adding all terms:

z³: -1,

z²: -0.5 + i(√3/2),

-5z: -2.5 -i(5√3)/2,

+3: +3.

Adding real parts: (-1) + (-0.5) + (-2.5) +3 = (-4) +3 = -1.

Imaginary parts: (√3/2) + (-5√3/2) = (-4√3)/2 = -2√3.

Thus modulus is sqrt( (-1)^2 + (-2√3)^2 ) = sqrt(1 + 12) = sqrt(13) ≈3.605, which is less than 8.

Hmm. What about z= e^{i2π/3} (120 degrees):

Similarly, z^3 = e^{i2π}=1,

z^2 = e^{i4π/3}= cos(4π/3)+i sin(4π/3)= -0.5 -i(√3/2),

-5z= -5*(cos(2π/3)+i sin(2π/3))= -5*(-0.5 + i(-√3/2))? 

---------------

Wait, no:

Wait z= e^{i2π/3} so cos(2π/3)= -0.5, sin(2π/3)=√3/2. So -5z is -5*(-0.5 + i√3/2) = 2.5 -i(5√3)/2,

plus 3.

Adding all terms:

z³:1,

z²: -0.5 -i√3/2,

-5z: 2.5 -i(5√3)/2,

+3: +3.

Real parts: 1 + (-0.5) +2.5 +3 = (1 -0.5) =0.5; 0.5 +2.5=3; 3+3=6.

Imaginary parts: (-√3/2) + (-5√3/2) = (-6√3)/2 = -3√3.

Modulus sqrt(6² + ( -3√3 )² ) = sqrt(36 +27)=sqrt(63)=3√7≈7.937, which is close to 8 but still less.

Hmm, so at z=-1, we have 8, which is higher.



---------------

Wait, let me check another point. Maybe z= e^{iθ} where θ is such that the derivative is zero?



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps z=-1 gives the maximum. But the problem states the answer is in terms of m√3 /n, so 8 is 8/1, which is 8√3 / (√3), but that's not in the form. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake?



---------------

Wait, the problem says the answer is in the form m√3 /n. 8 is 8/1, but that would require √3 in the denominator? Hmm, maybe there is a higher value?



---------------

Wait, let's check z= something else. Maybe θ= π, which is z=-1, already done. What about θ=0? z=1 gives 0. How about θ= π/2?

z=i as before, got 2√10 which is about 6.32, less than 8.



---------------

Wait, maybe another angle. Let me try θ= π/6 (30 degrees):

z= e^{iπ/6}= cos(π/6)+i sin(π/6)= (√3/2)+i(1/2).

Compute z^3: e^{iπ/2}=i,

z^2: e^{iπ/3}= 0.5 +i(√3/2),

-5z: -5*(√3/2 +i/2)= - (5√3)/2 -i5/2,

+3: +3.

Adding all terms:

z³: i,

z²: 0.5 +i(√3/2),

-5z: - (5√3)/2 -i5/2,

+3: +3.

Real parts: 0.5 +3 - (5√3)/2,

Imaginary parts: 1 (from i) + (√3/2) -5/2.



---------------

Wait, let me compute step by step:

Real parts:

z³ is purely imaginary, so real part 0,

z²: 0.5,

-5z: -5*(√3/2),

+3: +3.

So total real part: 0.5 - (5√3)/2 +3 = (3.5) - (5√3)/2 ≈3.5 - 4.330 ≈-0.830.

Imaginary parts:

z³: i (so 1),

z²: (√3/2)i,

-5z: -5*(1/2)i = -2.5i,

+3: 0.

Total imaginary part: 1 + (√3/2) -2.5 ≈1 +0.866 -2.5≈-0.634.

So modulus squared is (-0.83)^2 + (-0.634)^2 ≈0.689 +0.402≈1.09, so modulus ~1.04, which is small.

Hmm, so so far, z=-1 gives the maximum of 8. But the problem states the answer should be in the form m√3 over n, so 8 is 8/1, but perhaps there's a higher value?



---------------

Wait, maybe I made an error in calculation at z= e^{i2π/3}?

Wait let me recalculate that:

z= e^{i2π/3}, so:

z^3 = e^{i2π} =1,

z^2 = e^{i4π/3}= cos(4π/3)+i sin(4π/3)= -0.5 -i*(√3/2),

-5 z = -5*(cos(2π/3)+i sin(2π/3)) = -5*(-0.5 +i*(√3/2)) = 2.5 -i*(5√3/2),

+3.

Adding all terms:

Real parts:

z^3:1,

z^2:-0.5,

-5z:2.5,

+3:3,

Total real: 1 -0.5 +2.5 +3 = (1-0.5)=0.5; 0.5+2.5=3; 3+3=6.

Imaginary parts:

z^2: -i*(√3/2),

-5z: -i*(5√3/2),

Total imaginary: -i*(√3/2 +5√3/2)= -i*(3√3).

Thus, modulus squared is 6² + (3√3)^2= 36 +27=63, so modulus sqrt(63)=3√7≈7.937, which is indeed less than 8. So z=-1 gives 8.

Hmm, so maybe 8 is the maximum? But why the problem says the answer is in the form m√3/n?



---------------

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake here. Because 8 is an integer, but the problem specifies the answer should be m√3 over n. Maybe my assumption that z=-1 gives the maximum is wrong? Or maybe I made a mistake in calculation?



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum is indeed 8, but expressed as 8√3/(√3), but that complicates things. 

---------------

Alternatively, maybe there's another point where the modulus is higher?

Wait let me try z= e^{iθ} where θ is such that the expression reaches a higher value.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe parametrizing in terms of x = cosθ, since sinθ squared is 1 -x². Let me try to write everything in terms of x.

Let me recall the Real and Imaginary parts:

Real =4x³ + 2x² -8x +2,

Imaginary = -2y + 2xy -4y³, where y = sinθ.

But since y² =1 -x², maybe substitute y in terms of x. Let me see.

Imaginary = -2y + 2x y -4 y³ = y(-2 +2x -4y²). Hmm, but y² =1 -x², so y³ = y*(1 -x²). So substituting:

Imaginary = y [ -2 +2x -4(1 -x²) ]

= y [ -2 +2x -4 +4x² ]

= y [4x² +2x -6]

Hmm, so Imaginary = y*(4x² + 2x -6).

Therefore, |E|² = (Real)^2 + (Imaginary)^2.

Let me write Real as R and Imaginary as I.

So |E|² = R² + I².

Let me substitute I = y*(4x² +2x -6). Since y = sqrt(1 -x²), but with a ± sign. Hmm, but since we are squaring it anyway, maybe express in terms of x.



---------------

Wait, let's compute I²:

I² = y²*(4x² +2x -6)^2 = (1 -x²)*(4x² +2x -6)^2.

Therefore,

|E|² = [4x³ +2x² -8x +2]^2 + (1 -x²)*(4x² +2x -6)^2.

This is a function of x, where x is in [-1,1].

Hmm, perhaps this is a function we can maximize over x in [-1,1].

This seems very complicated, but maybe we can try plugging in x=-1, since that gives z=-1, which we already saw gives 8.

Let me check x=-1:

At x=-1,

Real =4*(-1)^3 +2*(-1)^2 -8*(-1) +2 = -4 +2 +8 +2 =8,

Imaginary = y*(4*(-1)^2 +2*(-1) -6) = y*(4 -2 -6)= y*(-4).

But since x=-1, y=0 (since sinθ=0 when cosθ=-1). So Imaginary term is 0. Therefore modulus squared is 8²=64, so modulus is 8, which matches.

Now, let me try x=1:

x=1,

Real =4*1 +2*1 -8*1 +2=4+2-8+2=0,

Imaginary = y*(4*1 +2*1 -6)= y*(0). Since x=1, y=0, so imaginary term is 0. Thus modulus is 0, as before.

Now, let me try x=0.5:

x=0.5,

Real =4*(0.125) +2*(0.25) -8*(0.5)+2 =0.5 +0.5 -4 +2 = (0.5+0.5)=1; 1-4=-3; -3+2=-1,

Imaginary = y*(4*(0.25) +2*(0.5) -6) = y*(1 +1 -6)= y*(-4). Since x=0.5, y= sqrt(3)/2,

Thus Imaginary = (sqrt(3)/2)*(-4)= -2√3,

Therefore modulus squared is (-1)^2 + (-2√3)^2 =1 + 12=13, modulus sqrt(13)≈3.605.

Same as before.

Hmm, maybe try x=0. Let me see:

x=0,

Real =0 +0 -0 +2=2,

Imaginary = y*(0 +0 -6)= y*(-6). Since x=0, y=±1,

Thus, Imaginary = ±(-6),

Therefore modulus is sqrt(2² +6²)=sqrt(40)=2√10≈6.324.

Hmm, same as when z=i.



---------------

Wait, maybe try x=0. Let me see another x value.

Hmm, perhaps x= -0.5?

x= -0.5,

Real =4*(-0.125) +2*(0.25) -8*(-0.5)+2 = -0.5 +0.5 +4 +2 = (-0.5+0.5)=0; 0+4+2=6,

Imaginary = y*(4*(0.25) +2*(-0.5) -6)= y*(1 -1 -6)= y*(-6).

Since x=-0.5, y= sqrt(3)/2,

Thus, Imaginary = (sqrt(3)/2)*(-6)= -3√3,

Thus modulus squared is 6² + ( -3√3 )² =36 +27=63, modulus sqrt(63)=3√7≈7.937. Same as when θ=2π/3.

Hmm, so so far, the maximum is at x=-1 (z=-1) with modulus 8. However, the problem states the answer should be in the form m√3/n. Hmm, that suggests that maybe my assumption is wrong and the maximum is actually something else?



---------------

Alternatively, maybe there's a point where the modulus is higher than 8?

Wait, let me think again.

Wait, let me check z= e^{iθ} where θ is such that the expression is maximized. To do this, perhaps I can consider the function f(θ)= |z³ + z² -5 z +3|², and set its derivative to zero.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe using calculus of real variables. Let me consider θ as variable and compute d/dθ |f(θ)|² =0.

Let me denote f(θ) = e^{i3θ} + e^{i2θ} -5e^{iθ} +3,

then |f(θ)|² = f(θ) * \overline{f(θ)} = [e^{i3θ} + e^{i2θ} -5e^{iθ} +3][e^{-i3θ} + e^{-i2θ} -5e^{-iθ} +3].

Let me compute this product step by step:

Let me denote A = e^{i3θ}, B = e^{i2θ}, C= e^{iθ}, D=3,

then \overline{A}=e^{-i3θ}, \overline{B}=e^{-i2θ}, \overline{C}=e^{-iθ}, \overline{D}=3,

So the product is (A + B -5C + D)(\overline{A} + \overline{B} -5\overline{C} + D).

Expanding this:

A\overline{A} + A\overline{B} + A*(-5\overline{C}) + A D +

B\overline{A} + B\overline{B} + B*(-5\overline{C}) + B D +

(-5C)\overline{A} + (-5C)\overline{B} + (-5C)*(-5\overline{C}) + (-5C) D +

D\overline{A} + D\overline{B} + D*(-5\overline{C}) + D².

But this is going to be a lot of terms. Let me see if there's a smarter way.



---------------

Alternatively, note that A\overline{A}= |A|²=1, since |e^{i3θ}|=1,

Similarly, B\overline{B}=1, C\overline{C}=1,

D\overline{D}=9,

The cross terms:

A\overline{B}= e^{i3θ}e^{-i2θ}=e^{iθ},

A*(-5\overline{C}) = -5 e^{i3θ}e^{-iθ}= -5 e^{i2θ},

A D= A*3 =3 e^{i3θ},

Similarly, B\overline{A}=e^{i2θ}e^{-i3θ}=e^{-iθ},

B*(-5\overline{C})= -5 e^{i2θ}e^{-iθ}= -5 e^{iθ},

B D=3 e^{i2θ},

Continuing:

(-5C)\overline{A}= -5 e^{iθ} e^{-i3θ}= -5 e^{-i2θ},

(-5C)\overline{B}= -5 e^{iθ}e^{-i2θ}= -5 e^{-iθ},

(-5C)*(-5\overline{C})=25 |C|²=25,

(-5C) D= -15 e^{iθ},

D\overline{A}=3 e^{-i3θ},

D\overline{B}=3 e^{-i2θ},

D*(-5\overline{C})= -15 e^{-iθ},

D²=9.

Now, let's collect all terms:

First, the squared terms:

|A|² + |B|² + |C|² + |D|² =1 +1 +1 +9=12.

Then the cross terms:

Terms with e^{iθ}:

A\overline{B}=e^{iθ},

B\overline{A}=e^{-iθ},

A D=3 e^{i3θ},

B D=3 e^{i2θ},

and others?



---------------

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me see:

Wait, actually, this is going to take a while. Let me try to collect terms by exponentials:

Terms with e^{i3θ}:

A D = 3 e^{i3θ},

Terms with e^{-i3θ}:

D\overline{A}=3 e^{-i3θ},

Terms with e^{i2θ}:

A*(-5\overline{C}) = -5 e^{i2θ},

B D =3 e^{i2θ},

Terms with e^{-i2θ}:

(-5C)\overline{A}= -5 e^{-i2θ},

D\overline{B}=3 e^{-i2θ},

Terms with e^{iθ}:

A\overline{B}=e^{iθ},

B*(-5\overline{C})= -5 e^{iθ},

(-5C)\overline{B}= -5 e^{-iθ} (

---------------

Wait, no, that was e^{-iθ}? Let me check:

Wait, (-5C)\overline{B}= -5 e^{iθ} e^{-i2θ}= -5 e^{-iθ},

Similarly, terms with e^{-iθ}:

B\overline{A}=e^{-iθ},

(-5C)\overline{B}= -5 e^{-iθ},

D*(-5\overline{C})= -15 e^{-iθ},

Terms with constants:

The term from (-5C)*(-5\overline{C})=25,

and also terms like (-5C)*D = -15 e^{iθ},



---------------

Wait, maybe I missed some terms.

This is getting too involved. Maybe I can instead compute the derivative numerically?

Alternatively, perhaps there is a smarter approach.



---------------

Wait a minute, let me think again. Since |z|=1, then z^{-1}= \overline{z}, so we can write the expression z^3 + z^2 -5 z +3 as z^3 + z^2 -5 z +3.

Perhaps we can consider the expression as follows:

Let me denote the polynomial f(z)= z^3 + z^2 -5 z +3. Since |z|=1, maybe we can write f(z)= z^3 + z^2 -5 z +3 = z(z² + z -5) +3.

Hmm, perhaps using the triangle inequality? Let's see.

|f(z)| = |z(z² + z -5) +3| ≤ |z(z² + z -5)| + |3| = |z² + z -5| +3. Since |z|=1,

|z² + z -5| ≤ |z²| + |z| + | -5 | =1+1+5=7,

so |f(z)| ≤7+3=10. But we have already found a point where |f(z)|=8, so this is a loose bound.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps reverse triangle inequality? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe consider that z^3 + z^2 -5 z +3 = (z^3 + z^2) -5(z - (3/5)).

Hmm, not sure.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps consider writing the expression as follows:

Let me think of f(z) = z^3 + z^2 -5 z +3 = (z^3 + z^2) + (-5z +3).

Since z is on the unit circle, maybe we can bound each part?



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps factor the polynomial. Let me see if f(z) can be factored.

Suppose f(z) = z^3 + z^2 -5 z +3. Let's try rational roots. Possible roots are ±1, ±3.

Testing z=1: 1+1-5+3=0. So z=1 is a root.

Therefore, we can factor f(z) as (z-1)(z² + 2z -3).

Let me check: (z-1)(z² +2z -3) = z³ +2z² -3z -z² -2z +3 = z³ +z² -5z +3. Yes, correct.

Therefore, f(z)= (z-1)(z² +2 z -3).

Now, since z is on the unit circle, maybe this helps. Let's see:

We need to compute |f(z)| = |z-1| * |z² +2 z -3|.

Hmm, so the modulus is the product of |z-1| and |z² +2 z -3|.

Maybe this factorization helps in finding the maximum?

Let me denote A = |z -1|,

and B = |z² +2 z -3|,

so |f(z)|= A * B.

We need to maximize A*B over |z|=1.

Hmm, perhaps we can write z as e^{iθ} again and compute A*B.

Let me try that.

Let z = e^{iθ}, so A = |e^{iθ} -1| = sqrt{(cosθ -1)^2 + sin²θ} = sqrt{2 - 2cosθ}.

Similarly, B = |z² + 2 z -3|.

Let me compute B:

z² +2 z -3 = e^{i2θ} + 2 e^{iθ} -3.

Expressed in terms of cosθ and sinθ,

Real part: cos2θ +2 cosθ -3,

Imaginary part: sin2θ + 2 sinθ.

Therefore, B² = (cos2θ +2 cosθ -3)^2 + (sin2θ +2 sinθ)^2.

Let me compute this:

First, expand Real part squared:

(cos2θ +2cosθ -3)^2 = cos²2θ +4cos²θ +9 +4cos2θ cosθ -6cos2θ -12cosθ,



---------------

Wait, actually, better to compute step by step:

Let me denote R = cos2θ +2cosθ -3,

I = sin2θ +2 sinθ,

then B² = R² + I².

Compute R² + I²:

= [cos2θ +2cosθ -3]^2 + [sin2θ +2 sinθ]^2.

Let me expand each term.

First term:

[cos2θ +2cosθ -3]^2 = (cos2θ)^2 + (2cosθ)^2 + (-3)^2 + 2*cos2θ*(2cosθ) + 2*cos2θ*(-3) + 2*(2cosθ)*(-3)

= cos²2θ +4cos²θ +9 +4cos2θ cosθ -6cos2θ -12cosθ.

Second term:

[sin2θ +2 sinθ]^2 = sin²2θ +4 sin²θ +4 sin2θ sinθ.

Thus, adding both terms:

cos²2θ +4cos²θ +9 +4cos2θ cosθ -6cos2θ -12cosθ + sin²2θ +4 sin²θ +4 sin2θ sinθ.

Now, group terms:

cos²2θ + sin²2θ =1,

4cos²θ +4 sin²θ =4(cos²θ + sin²θ)=4,

Then remaining terms:

9,

+4cos2θ cosθ -6cos2θ -12cosθ,

+4 sin2θ sinθ,

Thus total:

1 +4 +9 + [4cos2θ cosθ -6cos2θ -12cosθ +4 sin2θ sinθ].

Simplify constants: 1+4+9=14.

Now, the remaining terms:

4cos2θ cosθ +4 sin2θ sinθ -6cos2θ -12cosθ.

Notice that 4cos2θ cosθ +4 sin2θ sinθ =4[cos2θ cosθ + sin2θ sinθ] =4cos(2θ -θ)=4cosθ, using cosine of difference identity.



---------------

Wait, cos(A - B)=cosA cosB + sinA sinB,

so cos2θ cosθ + sin2θ sinθ = cos(2θ -θ)=cosθ.

Therefore, that term becomes 4cosθ.

Thus, the remaining terms simplify to:

4cosθ -6cos2θ -12cosθ

= (4cosθ -12cosθ) -6cos2θ

= (-8cosθ) -6cos2θ.

Therefore, total B² =14 -8cosθ -6cos2θ.

Therefore, B squared is 14 -8cosθ -6cos2θ.

Hmm, so B = sqrt(14 -8cosθ -6cos2θ).

Therefore, the expression to maximize is A*B = sqrt(2-2cosθ) * sqrt(14 -8cosθ -6cos2θ).

Hmm, this is still complicated, but perhaps manageable.

Let me denote x = cosθ. Since cos2θ = 2x² -1,

Thus, substitute into B squared:

14 -8x -6*(2x² -1)=14 -8x -12x² +6=20 -8x -12x².

Thus, B squared becomes 20 -8x -12x²,

and A squared is 2-2x,

so the product (A*B)^2 = (2-2x)(20 -8x -12x²).

Therefore, to maximize |f(z)|, we can maximize sqrt[(2-2x)(20 -8x -12x²)] over x in [-1,1].

Since the square root is a monotonic function, it's equivalent to maximizing the expression inside:

Let me compute the product:

(2 -2x)(20 -8x -12x²) =2*(1 -x)*(20 -8x -12x²).

Let me expand this:

First, compute (1 -x)(20 -8x -12x²):

=1*(20 -8x -12x²) -x*(20 -8x -12x²)

=20 -8x -12x² -20x +8x² +12x³

Combine like terms:

20,

-8x -20x = -28x,

-12x² +8x² = -4x²,

+12x³.

Thus, total expression:

12x³ -4x² -28x +20.

Multiply by 2:

2*(12x³ -4x² -28x +20) =24x³ -8x² -56x +40.



---------------

Wait, no, wait: the previous step was (1 -x)(20 -8x -12x²)=12x³ -4x² -28x +20,

then multiplied by 2 gives 24x³ -8x² -56x +40. 

---------------

Wait, no, actually:

Wait, the original product (2 -2x)(20 -8x -12x²)=2*(1 -x)*(20 -8x -12x²)=2*(12x³ -4x² -28x +20).

Thus, the expression to maximize is 2*(12x³ -4x² -28x +20)=24x³ -8x² -56x +40.



---------------

Wait, but we are trying to maximize the product (2-2x)(20 -8x -12x²), which is equal to 24x³ -8x² -56x +40?



---------------

Wait let me verify:

Wait, let me redo the expansion step:

(1 -x)(20 -8x -12x²) = 1*(20 -8x -12x²) -x*(20 -8x -12x²)

= 20 -8x -12x² -20x +8x² +12x³

=20 - (8x +20x) + (-12x² +8x²) +12x³

=20 -28x -4x² +12x³.

So yes, that's 12x³ -4x² -28x +20.

Multiply by 2 gives 24x³ -8x² -56x +40.

Therefore, the expression inside the square root is 24x³ -8x² -56x +40, and we need to maximize this over x in [-1,1].

Hmm, so now we can treat this as a cubic function in x, f(x)=24x³ -8x² -56x +40, and find its maximum on [-1,1].

To find the maximum, we can take derivative and set to zero.

Compute f’(x)=72x² -16x -56.

Set to zero:

72x² -16x -56 =0.

Divide both sides by 8: 9x² -2x -7 =0.

Solve quadratic equation:

x = [2 ± sqrt(4 + 4*9*7)]/(2*9) = [2 ± sqrt(4 +252)]/18 = [2 ± sqrt(256)]/18 = [2 ±16]/18.

Thus,

x=(2+16)/18=18/18=1,

x=(2-16)/18=(-14)/18= -7/9≈-0.777...

Therefore critical points at x=1 and x= -7/9.

Now, evaluate f(x) at critical points and endpoints.

Endpoints:

At x=1,

f(1)=24(1) -8(1) -56(1)+40=24-8-56+40=0.

At x=-1,

f(-1)=24*(-1)^3 -8*(-1)^2 -56*(-1)+40= -24 -8 +56 +40= (-24-8)+(56+40)= -32 +96=64.

Critical points:

At x=1: already done, gives 0.

At x=-7/9,

Compute f(-7/9):

First, compute each term:

24x³ =24*(-343)/(729)= but this might be tedious.



---------------

Alternatively, compute numerically:

x= -7/9≈-0.7778.

Compute 24x³: 24*(-0.7778)^3≈24*(-0.473)=≈-11.35,

-8x²: -8*(0.605)=≈-4.84,

-56x: -56*(-0.7778)=≈43.55,

+40.

Adding up:

-11.35 -4.84 +43.55 +40≈(-16.19) +83.55≈67.36.



---------------

Wait let me compute more accurately:

First, let's compute exact value:

Let me compute f(-7/9):

24*(-7/9)^3 -8*(-7/9)^2 -56*(-7/9) +40.

Compute each term:

First term:

24*(-343)/(729) =24*(-343)/729,

Second term:

-8*(49/81)= -392/81,

Third term:

-56*(-7/9)= 392/9,

Fourth term:

40.

Let me compute term by term:

First term: 24*(-343)/729 = (-8232)/729,

Second term: -392/81 = -3528/729,

Third term: 392/9 = (392*81)/729 = 31752/729,

Fourth term: 40 = (40*729)/729 =29160/729.

Adding all terms over 729:

[ -8232 -3528 +31752 +29160 ] /729.

Compute numerator:

-8232 -3528 = -11760,

31752 +29160 =60912,

Total: -11760 +60912=49152.

Thus f(-7/9)=49152/729= divide numerator and denominator by 9:

49152 ÷9=5461.333… 

---------------

Wait, 729=9^3, 49152 ÷ 9=5461.333? 

---------------

Wait maybe better to divide numerator and denominator by 9:

49152 ÷9= 5461.333... Hmm, but let me see:



---------------

Wait 49152 divided by 729:

729 × 67 = 729×60=43740, 729×7=5103, total 43740+5103=48843.

49152 -48843=309.

So 67 + 309/729 ≈67.424.

Thus, f(-7/9)=67.424.

Compare to f(-1)=64, so the maximum occurs at x=-7/9≈-0.7778, giving f(x)= ~67.424.

Thus the maximum of the expression inside the square root is approximately 67.424, so the maximum |f(z)| is sqrt(67.424)≈8.21.



---------------

Wait, but this is higher than the 8 we found earlier. So this suggests that the maximum is actually around 8.21, which would be expressed as m√3 /n.



---------------

Wait, let me compute the exact value.

At x=-7/9, the value of f(x)=24x³ -8x² -56x +40 was 49152/729.

Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 9:

49152 ÷9 =5461.333…, 729 ÷9=81,



---------------

Wait 49152 ÷ 9:

9×5461=49149, so remainder 3, so 5461 and 3/9, so 5461.333...



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps 49152/729 = (49152 ÷ 3)/(729 ÷3)=16384/243.

Hmm, 243 ×67= 16281, 16384-16281=103, so 67 +103/243 ≈67.4238.

So sqrt(16384/243)= sqrt(16384)/sqrt(243)= 128/(9√3)= (128√3)/(9×3)=128√3/27? 

---------------

Wait let me see:

Wait sqrt(243)=sqrt(81×3)=9√3,

Thus sqrt(16384/243)=sqrt(16384)/sqrt(243)=128/(9√3)= (128√3)/(9×3)=128√3/27? 

---------------

Wait no:

Wait sqrt(16384)=128,

sqrt(243)=9√3,

Therefore sqrt(16384/243)=128/(9√3).

Rationalizing the denominator:

128/(9√3) = (128√3)/(9×3)=128√3/27.

Therefore the maximum |f(z)| is 128√3 /27.



---------------

Wait but 128 divided by 27 is approximately 4.7407, and multiplied by √3≈2.828 gives about 4.7407×2.828≈13.4, but that contradicts previous approximate value of ~8.21.



---------------

Wait, there's a mistake here. Wait, the expression inside the square root was (2-2x)(20 -8x -12x²)= f(x)=24x³ -8x² -56x +40,

At x=-7/9, this evaluates to 49152/729≈67.424,

so the square root is sqrt(67.424)≈8.21,

But according to the exact value:

128/(9√3)=128/(9*1.732)≈128/(15.588)≈8.21,

Yes, that's correct. So the exact value is 128√3/(9*3)=?



---------------

Wait no, sqrt(16384/243)= sqrt(16384)/sqrt(243)=128/(9√3)= (128√3)/(9*3)=128√3/27≈(128/27)*1.732≈4.74*1.732≈8.21.

Yes, so the exact maximum value is 128√3 / 27?



---------------

Wait, let me recheck the calculation:

The expression inside was f(x)=24x³ -8x² -56x +40 evaluated at x=-7/9 gives 49152/729.

But 49152 divided by 729:

Let me compute 729×67=729*(60+7)=43740 +5103=48843,

49152-48843=309,

Thus 49152/729=67 + 309/729=67 + 103/243.

But 24x³ -8x² -56x +40 at x=-7/9:

24*(-343/729) -8*(49/81) -56*(-7/9) +40.

Compute term by term:

First term: 24*(-343)/729 = (-8232)/729,

Second term: -8*(49)/81 = (-392)/81 = (-392*9)/729 = (-3528)/729,

Third term: -56*(-7)/9 = (392)/9 = (392*81)/729 = (31752)/729,

Fourth term:40 = (40*729)/729 =29160/729,

Adding all together:

(-8232 -3528 +31752 +29160)/729,

Compute numerator:

-8232 -3528 = -11760,

31752 +29160 = 60912,

Total numerator: -11760 +60912=49152,

Yes, so 49152/729= 49152 divided by 729.

Now sqrt(49152/729)=sqrt(49152)/sqrt(729)=sqrt(49152)/27.

Compute sqrt(49152):

49152 divided by 64= 768.

Thus sqrt(49152)=sqrt(64×768)=8×sqrt(768).

sqrt(768)=sqrt(256×3)=16√3,

Thus sqrt(49152)=8×16√3=128√3,

Therefore sqrt(49152/729)=128√3 /27.

Thus the maximum |f(z)| is 128√3 /27.

Therefore, the answer is 128√3 /27, so m=128, n=27, m +n=155.



---------------

Wait, but let me confirm that this is indeed the maximum.

Earlier, at x=-1, which corresponds to z=-1, we had f(x)= (2-2x)(20 -8x -12x²) evaluated at x=-1 is:

2-2*(-1)=4,

20 -8*(-1) -12*(1)=20+8-12=16,

so 4*16=64, so sqrt(64)=8, which matches.

At x=-7/9, we get sqrt(49152/729)=128√3/27≈8.21, which is higher.

Therefore the maximum is indeed 128√3/27, so m=128, n=27, so m +n=155.

Therefore the answer is 155.

But let me check if 128 and27 have common factors. 128 is 2^7, 27 is 3^3, so no common factors. Thus the fraction is reduced.

Hence the answer is 155.

**Final Answer**
Answer: 155


Given a complex number \( z \) with \( |z| = 1 \), we need to find the maximum value of \( |z^3 + z^2 - 5z + 3| \). The answer should be in the form \( \frac{m \sqrt{3}}{n} \), and we need to find \( m + n \).

First, we note that \( z \) lies on the unit circle, so we can write \( z = e^{i\theta} \). We then express the polynomial \( f(z) = z^3 + z^2 - 5z + 3 \) in terms of trigonometric functions and find its modulus. 

By factoring the polynomial, we find \( f(z) = (z - 1)(z^2 + 2z - 3) \). We then need to maximize the product of the moduli \( |z - 1| \) and \( |z^2 + 2z - 3| \).

Using trigonometric identities and substitutions, we convert the problem into a function of \( x = \cos\theta \). After expanding and simplifying, we find the expression to maximize is \( (2 - 2x)(20 - 8x - 12x^2) \).

Solving the cubic equation derived from setting the derivative to zero, we find critical points at \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -\frac{7}{9} \). Evaluating the function at these points and endpoints, we find the maximum value occurs at \( x = -\frac{7}{9} \).

The maximum value of \( |z^3 + z^2 - 5z + 3| \) is found to be \( \frac{128\sqrt{3}}{27} \). Thus, \( m = 128 \) and \( n = 27 \), leading to \( m + n = 155 \).

\[
\boxed{155}
\]
