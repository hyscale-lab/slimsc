Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem about Theresa's basketball points. Hmm, let me read it again carefully. 

So, in her first 8 games, she scored those numbers: 7, 4, 3, 6, 8, 3, 1, and 5 points. Then in her ninth game, she scored fewer than 10 points, and her average for the nine games was an integer. Then in the tenth game, same thing: fewer than 10 points, and the average for ten games is also an integer. We have to find the product of the points from the ninth and tenth games.

Alright, step by step. First, let me figure out the total points from the first 8 games. Let me add those numbers up. 

Starting with 7 + 4 is 11. Then 11 + 3 is 14. 14 +6 is 20. 20 +8 is 28. 28 +3 is 31. 31 +1 is 32. 32 +5 is 37. Wait, let me check that again because

---------------

 adding step by step can lead to errors. Let me list them again:

7, 4, 3, 6, 8, 3, 1, 5. 

Adding them in order:

First game: 7

Second: 7 +4=11

Third: 11+3=14

Fourth:14+6=20

Fifth:20+8=28

Sixth:28+3=31

Seventh:31+1=32

Eighth:32+5=37. Okay, that's correct. So total after 8 games is 37 points.

Now, in the ninth game, she scores some points, let's call that x, which is less than 10. So x can be from 0 to 9, but since it's points in a game, I guess 0 is possible? The problem says "fewer than 10," so yeah

---------------

, 0 through 9. 

After nine games, the total points would be 37 + x, and the average is (37 + x)/9, and that has to be an integer. So (37 + x) must be divisible by 9. 

Similarly, in the tenth game, she scores y points, also less than 10. So y is 0-9. Then the total after ten games is 37 + x + y, and the average (37 + x + y)/10 must also be an integer. 

We need to find x and y such that both conditions hold, and then compute x*y.

Alright, let's first tackle the ninth game. 

We need (37 + x) divisible by 9. Let me compute 37 divided by 9 to see the remainder. 9*4=36, so 37 is 36 +1, so remainder 1. Therefore, 37 + x ≡ 1 + x mod 9. To have this divisible by 9, 1 + x ≡0 mod 9, so x ≡ -1 mod9, which is x ≡8 mod9. But since x is between 0 and 9, x must be 8. Wait, but hold

---------------

 on. Wait, that would make 37 +8=45, which is 5*9, so that works. But the

---------------

 problem says she scored fewer than 10 points, so 8 is allowed. But wait, is that the only possibility?

Wait, the

---------------

 remainder when 37 is divided by 9 is 1, so adding x needs to make the total remainder 0. So x must be 8 mod9, but since x is less than 10, the

---------------

 only possible x is 8. Hmm, okay. So x=8? Wait but let me check again. Let me compute

---------------

 37 +x divided by 9 must be integer. So 37 +x = 9k, where k is integer. Since after 9 games, the average is k. The total points would be 9k. So 9k must be between 37 +0=37 and 37 +9=46. Let's see which multiples of 9 are in that interval. 

The multiples of 9 near that range: 9*4=36 (too low), 9*5=45, 9*6=54 (too high). So only 45 is in 37 to 46. Therefore, 37 +x must equal 45. Therefore x=45-37=8. So x is 8. So the ninth game score

---------------

 is 8 points. Wait, but hold on, the problem says "she scored fewer than 10 points", so 8 is okay. So that's fixed? Hmm, so is

---------------

 there another possible x? Let me see. 9*5=45 is the only multiple between 37 and 46. So x must be 8. 

Wait, so that's determined

---------------

? So then x=8. Hmm, okay, so that's the ninth game. 

Now moving on to the tenth game. Let's see. Now the total after nine games is 37 +8=45. Then in the tenth game, she scores y points (y <10). The total after ten games is 45 + y. The average is (45 + y)/10, which must be an integer. So (45 + y) must be divisible by 10, so 45 + y ≡0 mod10. That

---------------

 means y ≡ -45 mod10. Since 45 mod10 is 5, so -45 mod10 is equivalent to -5 mod10, which is 5 mod10 (since -5 +10=5). Therefore, y must be congruent to 5 mod10. Since y is less than 10, the only possibility is y=5. 

Therefore, the tenth game score is 5 points. 

Therefore, the product is 8 *5=40. 

Wait, but hold on a second. Let me confirm again. 

Wait, let

---------------

 me check the tenth game calculation again. 

Total after 9 games is 45. Adding y gives 45 + y. To

---------------

 have 45 + y divisible by 10, so 45 + y must be 50, 60, etc. But since y is less than 10, the maximum possible total is 45 +9=54. So 50 is the only multiple of 10 in that range (since 45 to 54). Therefore 45 + y=50, so y=5. So that's correct. 

Therefore, the ninth

---------------

 game is 8, tenth is 5, product is 40. 

But wait, hold on, the problem says "the product of the number of points she scored in the ninth and tenth games." So 8*5=40. 



---------------

But wait, let me check again if there are other possibilities for x and y. Maybe I missed something?

Wait, for

---------------

 the ninth game, maybe I was too quick. Let me see again. The total after 8 games is 37. So

---------------

 total after nine games is 37 +x. The average must be integer. So 37 +x must be divisible by 9. The possible total points after 9 games must be a multiple of 9. The minimum possible total is 37 (if she scored 0) and maximum is 37 +9=46. The multiples of 9 between 37 and 46 are 36 (too low), 45, and 54 (too high). So only 45. So yes, x must be 8. So that is fixed. 

Then for

---------------

 the tenth game, the total after nine is 45. Adding y, which is less than 10, so total is

---------------

 45 + y. The average over 10 games is (45 + y)/10 must be integer, so total must be a multiple of 10. The possible totals are 50 (since 45 +5=50) or 60 (needs y=15, which is over 10). So only 50 is possible, so y=5. 

Therefore, product is 8*5=40. 

Wait, but the

---------------

 problem says "Similarly in her tenth game, she scored fewer than 10 points and her points-per-game average for the 10 games was also an integer." So seems

---------------

 correct. 

Hmm, but let me check again. Let me see the problem again to ensure I didn't misread anything. 

"In Theresa's first 8 basketball games, she scored 7, 4, 3, 6, 8, 3 and 1 and 5 points." Wait, let

---------------

 me recount those numbers. 7,4,3,6,8,3,1,5. That's 8 numbers. So

---------------

 that's correct. 

Total is 37 as calculated. 

Then ninth game: x <10, and average over 9 games is integer. So that

---------------

 requires total divisible by 9, leading to x=8. 

Then tenth game: y<10, average over 10 games is integer, so total divisible by 10, so y=5. 

Product is 8*5=40. 

Hmm, but

---------------

 maybe there's another possible y? Let me see again. 

Wait, suppose the total after 10 games is 50, which is 50/10=5 average. But maybe

---------------

 another multiple? Let's see, if y=5, total is 50. If y=15, which

---------------

 is impossible. Or maybe 40? 40 is less than 45? No, 40 is less than 45, but 45 + y must

---------------

 be at least 45. So the next lower multiple of 10 is 40, but 45 + y=40 would require y=-5, which isn't possible. So only 50. 

Therefore, only

---------------

 possible y is 5. 

Hmm, so seems like 40 is the answer. But wait, the problem says "the product of the number of points she scored in the ninth and tenth games." So 8 and 5 gives 40. 

Wait, but let

---------------

 me see if there's an alternative path where maybe the total after 9 games is a different multiple? For instance, maybe

---------------

 if x was different, but the average is still integer? Let me check again. 

Wait, the total after 8 games is 37. The

---------------

 ninth game's total must be 37 +x divisible by 9. The possible total after 9 games must be a multiple of 9. Let's list all multiples of 9 that are possible.

---------------

 The minimum possible total is 37 (if x=0), which is 37. The next multiple of 9 above 37 is 45 (since 9*5=45). Then next would be 54 (9*6=54), which would require x=54-37=17, which is more than 10, so impossible. So only possible multiple is 45, so x=8. 

Therefore, no

---------------

 other options here. 

Similarly, for the tenth game, the only possible multiple of 10 is 50, so y=5. 

Therefore, the answer is 8*5=40. 

Hmm, but wait

---------------

 a second, let me check if there is an alternative where after the ninth game, the total is 45 (so x=8), then the

---------------

 tenth game's total must be a multiple of 10, which is 50, so y=5. 



---------------

Alternatively, if there's another x and y that can satisfy the conditions? 

Wait, let's suppose that for some reason, maybe the average after 9 games is an integer, but not

---------------

 necessarily the next multiple? Wait, but if x is less than 10, then the total can't jump over to the next multiple. Since

---------------

 the previous multiple would be 36, which is lower than 37, so no. 

Alternatively, maybe I

---------------

 miscalculated the initial total? Let me re-add the first 8 games again. 

Scores: 7,4,3,6,8,3,1,5. 

Adding them step by step:

Start with 7.

7 +4 =11.

11+3=14.

14+6=20.

20+8=28.

28+3=31.

31+1=32.

32+5=37. 

Yes, that's correct. 

Hmm, so all

---------------

 steps check out. 

Therefore, the answer should be 8*5=40. 

Wait, but let me check again

---------------

 the problem statement once more to ensure I didn't overlook anything. 

"In Theresa's first 8 basketball games, she scored 7, 4, 3, 6, 8, 3, 1 and 5 points. In her ninth game, she scored fewer than 10 points and her points-per-game average for the nine games was an integer. Similarly in her tenth game, she scored fewer than 10 points and her points-per-game average for the 10 games was also an integer. Find the product of the number of points she scored in the ninth and tenth games."

Yes

---------------

, so all conditions are met with x=8 and y=5. 

Therefore, I think the answer is 40. 

Wait, but just

---------------

 to be thorough, let me see if there is another way. Let me suppose that maybe I made a mistake in the modulo calculation. 

For the ninth game, 37 mod9. Since 9*4=36, so 37 mod9 is 1. Therefore, 37 +x ≡1 +x mod9. To be 0 mod9, x must be 8. 

Similarly, total after nine is 45. Then 45 mod10 is 5. So 45 + y mod10 needs to be 0, so y must be 5 mod10, so y=5. 

Therefore

---------------

, all steps are correct. 

Hmm, okay, I think that's solid. So the answer is 40. 

**Final Answer**
Answer: 40



In Theresa's first 8 basketball games, she scored 7, 4, 3, 6, 8, 3, 1, and 5 points. The total points from these games is calculated as follows:

\[
7 + 4 + 3 + 6 + 8 + 3 + 1 + 5 = 37
\]

For the ninth game, let \( x \) be the points scored, which must be fewer than 10. The total points after nine games must be divisible by 9. The total points after nine games is \( 37 + x \). We need \( 37 + x \) to be a multiple of 9. The nearest multiple of 9 greater than 37 is 45. Thus,

\[
37 + x = 45 \implies x = 8
\]

For the tenth game, let \( y \) be the points scored, which must also be fewer than 10. The total points after ten games is \( 45 + y \). This total must be divisible by 10. The nearest multiple of 10 greater than 45 is 50. Thus,

\[
45 + y = 50 \implies y = 5
\]

The product of the points scored in the ninth and tenth games is:

\[
8 \times 5 = 40
\]
