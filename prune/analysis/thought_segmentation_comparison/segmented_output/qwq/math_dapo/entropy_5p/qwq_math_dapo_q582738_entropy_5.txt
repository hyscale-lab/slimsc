Okay, so I need to figure out the maximum number of points that could be in the domain of Lana's function f(x) = x², given that the range is exactly {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. 

First, the function is defined only on a finite set of x-values, and for each x in the domain, f(x) = x². The range has to cover all the numbers from 0 to 9 inclusive. That means every number from 0 through 9 must be achievable by squaring some x in the domain. But since the domain is finite, we have to make

---------------

 sure that each of these numbers is hit by at least one x, but also, we want to maximize the number of x's in the domain. 

So, the key here is probably to figure out for each y in the range {0,1,...,9}, how many different x's can map to it. Since the function is f(x)=x², each y in the range can be achieved by x = sqrt(y) or x = -sqrt(y). However, since we want

---------------

 the domain to have as many points as possible, we should include both the positive and negative roots whenever possible. But we have to make sure that all the required y-values are covered. 

Let me list out the y-values and their possible x's:

- y=0: Only x=0, since 0 squared is 0. There's no negative counterpart here because -0 is the same as 0. So only one x-value here.

- y=1: x can be 1 or -1. So two possible x-values.

- y=2: Hmm, sqrt(2) is irrational, right? So there's no integer x such that x²=2. Wait, but the problem doesn't say the domain has to consist of integers. Wait a second, hold on. The problem says "finitely many values x", but it doesn't specify they have to be integers. Wait, that complicates things. Wait, but the range is given as integers from 0 to 9. So if

---------------

 the function is f(x)=x², then to get an integer y, the x's must be either integers or square roots of integers. But

---------------

 if x is allowed to be any real number, then for each y in 0-9, there are two real numbers x: sqrt(y) and -sqrt(y), except for y=0, which only has x=0. 

However, the problem says the domain consists of finitely many values. So,

---------------

 if we can choose any real numbers, but need the range to be exactly those integers, then to get each y from 0 to 9, we need at least one x such that x² = y. But since the problem says the domain is finite, but

---------------

 the question is asking for the maximum number of points in the domain. To maximize the domain, we need to include as many x's as possible such that their squares cover all the required y's. 

Wait, but if

---------------

 we can choose any real numbers, then for each y from 0 to 9, we can include both sqrt(y) and -sqrt(y), except for y=0. So

---------------

, that would give 1 (for y=0) + 2*9 (for y=1 to 9) = 1 + 18 = 19 points. But wait

---------------

, but the problem states that the range is exactly {0,1,...,9}, so we must not include any x's whose squares would produce numbers outside that range. Because

---------------

 if we include an x whose square is, say, 10, then the range would include 10, which is not allowed. Therefore, all x's in the domain must satisfy x² ≤ 9. So the domain is restricted to x in [-3, 3], but only at

---------------

 specific points. 

Wait, but actually, x can be any real number such that x² is between 0 and 9. So x must be between -3 and 3. But to make

---------------

 sure that the range doesn't exceed 9, the maximum |x| can be is 3, since 3²=9. Similarly, the minimum is -3. However, if

---------------

 we include x values beyond sqrt(9)=3, but since 3 is the square root of 9, so we

---------------

 can't go beyond that. 

But the problem is, to get the maximum number of points in the domain, while ensuring that every number from 0 to 9 is achieved. So

---------------

, for each y in 0-9, we can have two x's except for y=0. But we have to check if those

---------------

 x's are unique. For example, if we have x=1 and x=-1, both give y=1. Similarly, x=2 and -2 give y=4, etc. 

But in

---------------

 order to have the maximum number of points, we need to include as many x's as possible such that each x's square is in 0-9, and the

---------------

 squares cover all numbers from 0 to 9. 

Wait, but actually, if we include all possible x's such that x² is between 0 and 9, then the domain would be the set { -3, -√9, ..., -√1, 0, √1, ..., √9 }, but actually

---------------

, all real numbers between -3 and 3. But since the domain has to be finite, we can pick as many points as we want as

---------------

 long as their squares cover the range. But the problem says the domain is a finite set of points. 

Wait, but

---------------

 the problem says "finitely many values x", so the domain is a finite set. To maximize the number of points, we can include every possible x such that x² is in 0-9, but also

---------------

 ensuring that all the required y's are covered. Wait, but how does that work?

Wait, perhaps the key is that to

---------------

 get each y in the range {0,1,...,9}, we need at least one x such that x² = y, but to maximize the domain, we can include as many x's as possible (

---------------

both positive and negative roots for each y), but without adding any extra y's beyond the range. 

Therefore, for each y from 0 to 9, we can include both sqrt(y) and -sqrt(y), except for y=0. However

---------------

, if we do this, then the domain would consist of:

For y=0: 1 point (0)

For y=1: 2 points (1 and -1)

For y=2: 2 points (√2 and -√2)

Similarly:

y=3: 2 points (√3 and -√3)

y=4: 2 points (2 and -2)

y=5: 2 points (√5 and -√5)

y=6: 2 points (√6 and -√6)

y=7: 2 points (√7 and -√7)

y=8: 2 points (2√2 and -2√2, since sqrt(8) is 2√2)

y=9: 2 points (3 and -3)

So, adding these up: 1 + (9 * 2) = 19 points. Wait, but hold

---------------

 on, let me count again:

Wait, for each y from 1 to 9, that's 9 numbers, each contributing 2 x-values, so 18, plus the 1 from y=0, so total 19. 

But the

---------------

 problem states that the range is exactly {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. So if we include all these x-values, then the range will indeed be exactly those numbers because each y from 0 to 9 is achieved by at least one x (the

---------------

 positive sqrt(y)), so that's okay. 

However, but the problem says the domain is a finite set of values. Since each

---------------

 of these x-values (like √2, √3, etc.) are distinct real numbers, so they are all distinct points. Therefore, the total number of points would be 19. 

But wait, is

---------------

 there any overlap? For example, is there any case where two different y's have the same x? For instance, could

---------------

 an x value squared give two different y's? No, each x maps to only one y. So as long as each x is unique, then

---------------

 the total points are 19. 

But hold on, the problem says "the function is given by the formula f(x)=x², but only on a domain she has specified which consists of finitely many values x". So as

---------------

 long as the domain is a finite set of points, and the range is exactly the given set. 

Therefore, if we include all these points, then yes, the range is exactly 0 through 9, and the domain has 19 points. 

But wait, but

---------------

 maybe the problem expects the domain to consist of integers? Because otherwise, if x can be any real number, then we could have infinitely many points between, say, -3 and 3, but the problem says the domain is finite. Wait

---------------

, but even if they are real numbers, as long as we choose finitely many points, then it's okay. So to

---------------

 maximize the number of points, you can include as many as possible, but each x must be such that x² is in 0-9 and every

---------------

 number from 0-9 is achieved. 

Therefore, the maximum number of points would indeed be 19. But wait

---------------

, but let me check again:

Wait, for each y from 1 to 9, there are two x's (positive and negative roots). For

---------------

 y=0, only one x (0). So that's 1 + 2*9 = 19. 

But maybe

---------------

 there's a mistake here. Let me check for each y:

y=0: x=0 (1)

y=1: ±1 (2)

y=2: ±√2 (2)

y=3: ±√3 (2)

y=4: ±2 (2)

y=5: ±√5 (2)

y=6: ±√6 (2)

y=7: ±√7 (2)

y=8: ±√8 (which is ±2√2, but still two distinct numbers) (2)

y=9: ±3 (2)

So that

---------------

's 1 + (9*2) = 19. 

Therefore, the maximum number of points in the domain is 19. 

Wait, but hold

---------------

 on a second. The problem says "the range of f(x) is {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}". So if

---------------

 we include all these x's, then the range is exactly those numbers. 

But is there a way to include even more points without adding more

---------------

 to the range? For example, could we have multiple x's mapping to the same y? But that's already accounted for. Since each y from 1-9 has two x's, so that

---------------

's already the maximum possible for each y. Since each y can have at most two x's (the positive and negative roots), except y=0. 

Therefore, 

---------------

19 is indeed the maximum. 

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Suppose we

---------------

 can have x values that are not the square roots? For example, suppose we have an x that is not sqrt(y) but still x

---------------

² is in the range. But if we include such an x, then its square would have to be one of the existing y's, so it would just be another x that maps to that y. But

---------------

 since we already have both roots for each y, there's no other x that can map to the same y without overlapping with existing x's. 

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 fractional x's? Wait, but fractional x's would square to fractions, but the range is integers. So unless the fractional x is sqrt(integer), which is exactly what we've

---------------

 considered. 

Therefore, the conclusion is 19. But let me check if the problem might have a different interpretation. 

Wait, maybe the problem expects the domain to consist of integers? Because

---------------

 if so, the answer would be different. Let me see. 

If the domain must consist of integers, then the possible x's are integers such that x² is between 0 and 9. The integers x with

---------------

 x² in 0-9 are x from -3 to 3, inclusive. 

So integers from -3 to 3: that's -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. So 7 points. But then the range would be 0,1,4,9. Because (-3)^2=9, (-2)^2=4, (-1)^2=1, 0^2=0, etc. So the range would be {0,1,4,9}, which is not the required {0,1,...,9}. 

Therefore, if the domain is restricted to integers, it's impossible to get the range up to 9. So

---------------

 the problem must allow non-integer x's. 

Therefore, going back, the maximum number is indeed 19. Wait, but the

---------------

 problem states "finitely many values x". So 19 is finite, so that works. 

Wait, but the

---------------

 problem says "finitely many values x", but the question is, can we have more than 19? Suppose we

---------------

 take x values that are duplicates? But no, because the domain is a set, so duplicates aren't allowed. 

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 some y's can have more than two x's? But for a given y, there are only two real numbers x such that x² = y (except

---------------

 y=0). So, for each y in 1-9, you can only have two x's. So adding

---------------

 more x's would have to be for different y's, but we have to stay within the range 0-9. 

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 using x=0 multiple times? But again, the domain is a set, so 0 can only be included once. 

Therefore, 19 is indeed the maximum. 

Wait, but let me check once

---------------

 more. Let me count again:

y=0: 1

y=1: 2

y=2: 2

y=3: 2

y=4: 2

y=5: 2

y=6: 2

y=7: 2

y=8: 2

y=9: 2

Total: 1 + (9*2) = 19. 

Yes, that seems right. 

Therefore

---------------

, the answer should be 19. 

Wait, but hold on, let me think again. For example, is

---------------

 sqrt(4) equal to 2 and -2, which are already included. So for y=4, the x's are 2 and -2. Similarly for others. So all

---------------

 those are accounted for. 

Alternatively, is there a case where an x might produce a square that's not in the desired range? For instance, if I include x= sqrt(10), but that would give y=10 which is outside the range, so that's not allowed. Therefore, all x's must satisfy x² ≤ 9 and x² ≥0, so x must be between -3 and 3. 

Therefore, all

---------------

 the x's we included are within that interval. 

Therefore, 19 is the correct answer. 

But wait, another

---------------

 thought: the problem says "the range of f(x) is {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}". So every

---------------

 number from 0 to 9 must be in the range. So if I include, say, both sqrt(2) and -sqrt(2), that gives y=2. Similarly, sqrt(3) gives y=3, etc. So all the numbers from 0 to 9 are covered. 

Therefore, the

---------------

 maximum possible domain size is 19. 

Hmm, I think that's correct. 

Wait, but let me check if

---------------

 maybe some of these sqrt(y) are the same as others? For instance, sqrt(4) is 2, which is an integer. But sqrt(2) is irrational and distinct from sqrt(3), etc. So all those x's are unique. 

Therefore, the

---------------

 total is indeed 19. 

So I think the answer is 19.

**Final Answer**
Answer: 19


To determine the maximum number of points in the domain of Lana's function \( f(x) = x^2 \) given that the range is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}\), we need to consider the possible \( x \)-values that can produce each \( y \)-value in the range.

For each \( y \) in the range:
- \( y = 0 \): The only \( x \) is \( 0 \). This contributes 1 point.
- \( y = 1 \): The \( x \) values are \( 1 \) and \( -1 \). This contributes 2 points.
- \( y = 2 \): The \( x \) values are \( \sqrt{2} \) and \( -\sqrt{2} \). This contributes 2 points.
- \( y = 3 \): The \( x \) values are \( \sqrt{3} \) and \( -\sqrt{3} \). This contributes 2 points.
- \( y = 4 \): The \( x \) values are \( 2 \) and \( -2 \). This contributes 2 points.
- \( y = 5 \): The \( x \) values are \( \sqrt{5} \) and \( -\sqrt{5} \). This contributes 2 points.
- \( y = 6 \): The \( x \) values are \( \sqrt{6} \) and \( -\sqrt{6} \). This contributes 2 points.
- \( y = 7 \): The \( x \) values are \( \sqrt{7} \) and \( -\sqrt{7} \). This contributes 2 points.
- \( y = 8 \): The \( x \) values are \( 2\sqrt{2} \) and \( -2\sqrt{2} \). This contributes 2 points.
- \( y = 9 \): The \( x \) values are \( 3 \) and \( -3 \). This contributes 2 points.

Summing these contributions:
- 1 (for \( y = 0 \)) + 2 (for each of \( y = 1 \) to \( y = 9 \)) = \( 1 + 2 \times 9 = 19 \).

Thus, the maximum number of points that could be in the domain is \(\boxed{19}\).
