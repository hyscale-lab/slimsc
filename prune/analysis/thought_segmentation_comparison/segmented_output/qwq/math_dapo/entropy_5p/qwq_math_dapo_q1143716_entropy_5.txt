Okay, let me try to tackle this geometry problem step by step. I need to find the value of k + m where the answer is in the form k/m. The problem is about a rectangle ABCD with sides AB = 4 and BC = 3. We have to construct a segment EF through point B such that EF is perpendicular to DB. Also, points A and C lie on lines DE and DF respectively. Hmm, that sounds a bit complex, but let me break it down.

First, I should probably sketch the rectangle to visualize everything. Let me imagine

---------------

 rectangle ABCD with AB = 4 and BC = 3. So, if I place the rectangle on a coordinate system, maybe with point A at the origin (0,0), then B would be at (4,0), C at (4,3), and D at (0,3). That way, AB is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (4,0), BC is vertical up to (4,3), CD goes back to (0,3), and DA down to (0,0). Let me confirm the sides: AB is 4 units, BC is 3 units, which matches the problem statement. Good.

Now, the segment EF is constructed through point B, and it needs to be perpendicular to DB. Let me recall that DB is the diagonal from D to B. Since D is (0,3) and B is (4,0), the diagonal DB can be represented as a line from (0,3) to (4,0). To

---------------

 find the slope of DB, I can compute (0 - 3)/(4 - 0) = -3/4. Therefore, the slope of DB is -3/4. Since EF is perpendicular to DB, its slope should be the negative reciprocal of -3/4, which is 4/3. So, the line EF has a slope of 4/3 and passes through point B (4,0). 

Let me write the equation of line EF. Using point-slope form: y - y1 = m(x - x1). Here, (x1, y1) is (4,0) and m is 4/3. So the equation becomes y = (4/3)(x - 4). That simplifies to y = (4/3)x - 16/3. So, EF is the line y = (4/3)x - 16/3.

Now, the problem states that points A and C lie on DE and DF respectively. Wait, DE and DF are lines? So DE is the line from D to E, and DF is the line from D to F? But E and F are points on EF? Wait, the

---------------

 segment EF is through B, so E and F are points on the line EF, but where exactly? The problem says "segment EF is constructed through B", so maybe EF is a line segment passing through B, but we

---------------

 need to determine points E and F such that A is on DE and C is on DF. Hmm, perhaps E and F are points such that when you draw lines from D to E and D to F, those lines pass through A and C respectively. 

Let me re

---------------

phrase: DE must pass through A, and DF must pass through C. Since D is fixed at (0,3), we need to find points E and F on the line EF (which is y = (4/3)x - 16/3) such that line DE goes through A (0,0) and line DF goes through C (4,3). 

So, point

---------------

 E is a point on line EF such that when you connect D(0,3) to E, this line passes through A(0,0). Wait, hold on, if

---------------

 DE connects D(0,3) to E and passes through A(0,0), then that line must be the line DA? But DA is from D(0,3) to A(0,0), which is vertical along the y-axis. But E

---------------

 is supposed to be on line EF, which has equation y = (4/3)x - 16/3. The line DA is the line x=0, so the only point where x=0 on EF is when x=0, so

---------------

 plugging into EF's equation: y = (4/3)(0) - 16/3 = -16/3. But that's point (0, -16/3). Wait, but that

---------------

 point is not between D and A. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps DE is not DA, but DE is a line from D to some point E on EF such that A lies on DE. So the

---------------

 line DE must pass through A. Let me think again. Let me denote E as a point on line EF. Since DE must pass through A, then the points D, E, and A must be colinear. Since

---------------

 D is (0,3) and A is (0,0), the line DA is the vertical line x=0. Therefore, if

---------------

 DE must pass through A, then E must lie on the line DA. But line DA is x=0, and line EF has equation y = (4/3)x - 16/3. The intersection of x=0 and EF is at x=0, y = -16/3. Therefore, point E is (0, -16/3). Wait

---------------

, so that's the point? Let me confirm. 

Similarly, DF must pass through point C(4,3). So DF is a line from D(0,3) to F on EF such that C is on DF. Let's find point F on line EF such that line DF passes through C(4,3). 

So first, let me find

---------------

 point E:

E is on EF (y=(4/3)x - 16/3) and on line DA (x=0). So as

---------------

 above, substituting x=0 gives y= -16/3, so E is (0, -16/3).

Now, point F is on line EF and line DF must pass through C(4,3). Let's find coordinates of F. Let me parametrize line EF. Let me denote

---------------

 a general point on EF as (x, (4/3)x - 16/3). Let me call this point F(t) = (t, (4/3)t - 16/3) where t is the x-coordinate. 

We need the line DF to pass through C(4,3). The line DF connects D(0,3) to F(t, (4/3)t - 16/3). Let me write the equation of line DF and see when it passes through (4,3).

First, the slope of DF is [ ( (4/3)t - 16/3 - 3 ) / ( t - 0 ) ] = [ ( (4t/3 - 16/3 - 9/3 ) / t ) ] = [ ( (4t - 25)/3 ) / t ] = (4t -25)/(3t)

So the equation of DF is y - 3 = [(4t -25)/(3t)](x - 0), so y = [(4t -25)/(3t)]x + 3.

We want this line to pass through (4,3). Let's substitute x=4, y=3 into the equation:

3 = [(4t -25)/(3t)]*4 + 3

Subtract 3 from both sides:

0 = [(4t -25)/(3t)]*4

So [(4t -25)/ (3t)] *4 =0

Which implies (4t -25)/ (3t) = 0

So 4t -25 =0 → 4t =25 → t=25/4.

Therefore, the x-coordinate of F is 25/4, so the coordinates of F are (25/4, (4/3)(25/4) -16/3). Let me compute that:

(4/3)(25/4) is 25/3, so 25/3 -16/3 = 9/3 = 3. Therefore, F is (25/4, 3).

Wait, that's interesting. The point F is (25/4, 3). Let me check if that makes sense. Since

---------------

 F is on EF, which is y = (4/3)x - 16/3, plugging x =25/4:

(4/3)*(25/4) =25/3, so 25/3 -16/3 = 9/3 =3. Yes, that checks out. So F is (25/4, 3).

Now, we

---------------

 have points E(0, -16/3) and F(25/4,3). The segment EF is between these two points, passing through B(4,0). Let me confirm that B is on EF. Let me plug x=4 into EF's equation: y=(4/3)(4) -16/3 = 16/3 -16/3=0. Yep, that's correct. So B is indeed on EF between E and F.

Now, the problem probably

---------------

 asks for the length of EF or something else? Wait, the problem says "the original answer is in k/m format". Wait, the problem didn't state what exactly is to be found. Wait, let

---------------

 me check again:

"Rectangle ABCD has AB=4 and BC=3. Segment EF is constructed through B so that EF is perpendicular to DB, and A and C lie on DE and DF, respectively. The original answer is in k/m format, please give the value of k + m."

Hmm, so

---------------

 maybe the question is asking for the length of EF? Because the problem didn't specify, but given the mention of k/m, probably

---------------

 the length. Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps the coordinates of E and F, but since they are fractions, maybe the length

---------------

 is fractional. Let me confirm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the distance between E and F? Let me check

---------------

 the problem again. Wait, the problem says "Solve the following math problem step by step. The last line of your response should be of the form Answer: $Answer (without quotes) where $Answer is the answer to the problem."

Wait

---------------

, the problem didn't explicitly state what the question is, but given the setup, perhaps it's a standard problem where the

---------------

 length of EF is to be found. Since the user mentions "the original answer is in k/m format", so probably the length is a fraction. Let me proceed

---------------

 under that assumption.

So, let's compute the distance between E(0, -16/3) and F(25/4, 3). The distance formula is sqrt[(x2 -x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2].

Compute x difference: 25/4 - 0 =25/4.

y difference: 3 - (-16/3) = 3 +16/3 = (9/3 +16/3)=25/3.

Therefore, the distance is sqrt[(25/4)^2 + (25/3)^2].

Let me compute each term:

(25/4)^2 = (625)/16,

(25/3)^2 = 625/9,

So sum is 625/16 +625/9 = 625*(1/16 +1/9) =625*( (9 +16)/(16*9) )=625*(25/144)= (625*25)/144.

Thus sqrt of that is sqrt(625*25 /144)= (25*5)/12= 125/12. Wait, let me check:

Wait sqrt(625*25 /144) = sqrt(625/144)*sqrt(25) = (25/12)*5 = 125/12. Wait, no

---------------

:

Wait sqrt(625*25 /144) = sqrt(625/144) * sqrt(25) = (25/12)*5? Wait sqrt(25) is 5, but actually sqrt(625*25)=sqrt(625)*sqrt(25)=25*5=125. Then sqrt(144)=12. So yes, 125/12. So the distance EF is 125/12. Therefore, k is 125, m is12, so k + m =137.

Wait, but let me confirm my

---------------

 calculations again because sometimes I might have messed up.

First, coordinates of E: (0, -16/3), coordinates of F: (25/4,3). The differences:

x: 25/4 -0 =25/4,

y: 3 - (-16/3)= 3 +16/3 = 25/3. Correct

---------------

.

Then squared differences:

(25/4)^2 = (625)/(16),

(25/3)^2=625/9,

Sum: 625/16 +625/9. Let me compute common

---------------

 denominator 144.

625/16 = (625*9)/144 = 5625/144,

625/9 = (625*16)/144 = 10000/144,

Wait 625*16 is 10,000? 625*10=6250, 625*6=3750, so 6250+3750=10,000. Yes. So total sum is (5625 +10,000)/144 =15,625/144. 

Therefore

---------------

 sqrt(15625/144)=125/12, since 125^2=15,625 and 12^2=144. So yes, that

---------------

's correct. So the length of EF is 125/12, so k=125 and m=12, so k + m=137. 

Therefore, the answer should be 137. Wait, but let me just

---------------

 confirm once again that the problem was indeed asking for the length of EF? Because the problem didn't specify, but given the mention

---------------

 of k/m, that's the most plausible. Let me check the problem again.

Wait the problem says: "Segment EF is constructed through B so that EF is perpendicular to DB, and A and C lie on DE and DF, respectively. The original answer is in k/m format, please give the value of k + m."

Hmm, the

---------------

 problem might be asking for the length of EF, which we found as 125/12. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking

---------------

 for the distance from B to somewhere else? But since the problem mentions "the original answer", perhaps in the original problem (

---------------

maybe from another source) the question was the length of EF, so that's what we're supposed to compute here. Alternatively

---------------

, maybe coordinates of E or F? Let me see.

Wait, coordinates of E is (0, -16/3) and F is (25/4, 3). If they were asking for coordinates, but

---------------

 the problem says "answer is in k/m format", so probably a single fraction. Since 125/12 is the length, so

---------------

 adding numerator and denominator gives 137. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the slope or something else? Let me think. Since

---------------

 EF is perpendicular to DB, but we already used that to find the slope. Maybe the problem is asking for the area or something else? Hmm

---------------

. Alternatively, perhaps the coordinates of E and F? But the problem says "the answer is in k/m format", so probably

---------------

 a single fraction. Since the length is 125/12, which reduces to that, so 125 +12 is 137. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the value of BE or BF? Let me check.

---------------

 If I compute BE, since B is (4,0) and E is (0, -16/3). The distance would be sqrt( (4)^2 + (0 +16/3)^2 ) = sqrt(16 + (256/9)) = sqrt( (144 +256)/9 ) = sqrt(400/9) =20/3. Similarly

---------------

 BF is from (4,0) to (25/4,3). Let me compute that:

x difference:25/4 -4 =25/4 -16/4=9/4,

y difference:3 -0=3,

distance BF: sqrt( (9/4)^2 + 3^2 )= sqrt(81/16 +9)= sqrt(81/16 +144/16)=sqrt(225/16)=15/4. 

Hmm

---------------

, but those are 20/3 and 15/4, but adding those numerators and denominators would give different numbers. Since

---------------

 the problem mentions the segment EF, the total length would be 125/12, so I think that's the answer. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem was from

---------------

 an image where the question was different, but given the problem as stated, I think the length of EF is the most plausible. Therefore

---------------

, I think the answer is 125/12, so 125 +12=137. 

Wait, just to be

---------------

 thorough, is there another possible interpretation?

The problem says "segment EF is constructed through B so that EF is perpendicular to DB, and A and C lie on DE and DF, respectively." So DE and DF are lines?

---------------

 So DE contains A and DF contains C. So DE is the line from D through E to A? Wait, E is on EF, so DE is a line from D through E which passes through A. Similarly DF is line from D through F passing through C. 

Therefore

---------------

, points E and F are determined by the intersections as I found. So the length of EF is between E(0, -16/3) and F(25/4, 3), which we computed as 125/12. Therefore, I

---------------

 think that's the correct answer. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the value of DE or DF? Let me see:

DE would be the distance from D(0,3) to E(0, -16/3). Since they have same x-coordinate, it's just the difference in y's: 3 - (-16/3)= 3 +16/3=25/3. So that's 25/3, so 25+3=28. But that's a

---------------

 possible answer but the problem mentions EF. 

Alternatively DF is from D(0,3) to F(25/4,3). Since they have the same y-coordinate, the distance is 25/4 -0 =25/4, so 25+4=29, but again, the

---------------

 problem mentions EF. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the area of some figure? The problem didn't specify, so I

---------------

 think the most logical is the length of EF. 

Therefore, I think the answer is 125/12, so k + m is 137.

**Final Answer**
Answer: 137


Rectangle \(ABCD\) has \(AB = 4\) and \(BC = 3\). We need to find the value of \(k + m\) where the length of segment \(EF\) is in the form \(\frac{k}{m}\). 

1. **Coordinates of the rectangle**:
   - \(A(0, 0)\), \(B(4, 0)\), \(C(4, 3)\), \(D(0, 3)\).

2. **Slope of diagonal \(DB\)**:
   - \(D(0, 3)\) to \(B(4, 0)\): slope = \(\frac{0 - 3}{4 - 0} = -\frac{3}{4}\).
   - Slope of \(EF\) (perpendicular to \(DB\)): \(\frac{4}{3}\).

3. **Equation of line \(EF\)**:
   - Passes through \(B(4, 0)\): \(y = \frac{4}{3}(x - 4)\) simplifies to \(y = \frac{4}{3}x - \frac{16}{3}\).

4. **Finding point \(E\)**:
   - \(E\) is on \(EF\) and line \(DA\) (vertical line \(x = 0\)).
   - Substituting \(x = 0\) into \(EF\)'s equation: \(y = -\frac{16}{3}\).
   - Coordinates of \(E\): \((0, -\frac{16}{3})\).

5. **Finding point \(F\)**:
   - \(F\) is on \(EF\) and line \(DF\) passes through \(C(4, 3)\).
   - Parametrize \(EF\) as \((t, \frac{4}{3}t - \frac{16}{3})\).
   - Line \(DF\) through \(D(0, 3)\) and \(F(t, \frac{4}{3}t - \frac{16}{3})\) must pass through \(C(4, 3)\).
   - Solving for \(t\) gives \(t = \frac{25}{4}\).
   - Coordinates of \(F\): \(\left(\frac{25}{4}, 3\right)\).

6. **Distance \(EF\)**:
   - Using distance formula between \(E(0, -\frac{16}{3})\) and \(F\left(\frac{25}{4}, 3\right)\):
     - \( \Delta x = \frac{25}{4} - 0 = \frac{25}{4} \)
     - \( \Delta y = 3 - \left(-\frac{16}{3}\right) = \frac{25}{3} \)
     - Distance: \( \sqrt{\left(\frac{25}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{25}{3}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{625}{16} + \frac{625}{9}} = \sqrt{\frac{15625}{144}} = \frac{125}{12} \).

7. **Result**:
   - The length of \(EF\) is \(\frac{125}{12}\), so \(k = 125\) and \(m = 12\). Thus, \(k + m = 137\).

\(\boxed{137}\)<|im_end|>
