Okay, so I have this problem here: If n is a positive even number, find the last two digits of (2^(6n) + 26) - (6^(2n) - 62). Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, I need to simplify the expression given. Let me write it out again to make sure I have it right: (2^{6n} + 26) - (6^{2n} - 62). Maybe I can combine

---------------

 like terms here. Let's distribute the negative sign through the second part. So that becomes 2^{6n} + 26 - 6^{2n} + 62. Then combining the constants: 26 + 62 is 88, so the expression simplifies to 2^{6n} - 6^{2n} + 88. 

Alright, so the problem is now to find the last two digits of that expression. Since we need the last two digits, this is equivalent to computing the expression modulo 100. So, I need to compute (2^{6n} - 6^{2n} + 88) mod 100. 

Hmm

---------------

, okay. Let me see. Since n is a positive even number, maybe I can express n as 2k where k is a positive integer. But not sure if that helps yet. Alternatively, perhaps I can find patterns in the exponents modulo 100 for 2 and 6. Since 

---------------

100 = 4*25, maybe using Euler's theorem or something? Wait, Euler's theorem says that if a and m are coprime, then a^φ(m) ≡ 1 mod m. φ(100) is φ(2^2 *5^2) = 100*(1-1/2)*(1-1/5) = 100*(1/2)*(4/5)= 100*(2/5)=40. So φ(100)=40. 

Therefore, for numbers coprime to 100, their exponents cycle every 40. However, 2 and 6 are not coprime to 100, so Euler's theorem doesn't apply directly here. Hmm, so maybe I need to compute modulo 4 and 25 separately and then use the Chinese Remainder Theorem? Or

---------------

 maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, perhaps compute each term modulo 100 directly. Let me see.

First, let me note

---------------

 that 2^{6n} can be written as (2^6)^n = 64^n. Similarly, 6^{2n} is (6^2)^n = 36^n. So the expression becomes (64^n - 36^n + 88) mod 100. 

So,

---------------

 the problem reduces to finding (64^n - 36^n + 88) mod 100 where n is even. Since n is even, let me let

---------------

 n = 2k. Wait, but maybe even better, since n is even, perhaps we can find a pattern for exponents of 64 and 36 modulo 100 when the exponent is even.

Alternatively, since

---------------

 64 and 36 are both even numbers, their powers will have certain properties. Let me see if I can find the cycles for 64^n mod 100 and 36^n mod 100.

Starting with 64^n mod 100:

Let me compute 64^1 mod 100 = 64

64^2 = 64*64 = 4096 mod 100 = 96

64^3 = 64*96 = 6144 mod 100 = 44

64^4 = 64*44 = 2816 mod 100 = 16

64^5 = 64*16 = 1024 mod 100 = 24

64^6 = 64*24 = 1536 mod 100 = 36

64^7 = 64*36 = 2304 mod 100 = 4

64^8 = 64*4 = 256 mod 100 = 56

64^9 = 64*56 = 3584 mod 100 = 84

64^10 = 64*84 = 5376 mod 100 = 76

64^11 = 64*76 = 4864 mod 100 = 64

Wait, 

---------------

64^11 mod 100 is 64 again. So the cycle length here is 10? Let's check:

From

---------------

 64^1 to 64^10, the residues were 64,96,44,16,24,36,4,56,84,76, and then 64 again at the 11th term. So the cycle length is 10. So every 10 exponents, it cycles. Therefore, the period is 10. 

So for 64^n mod 100, the cycle length is 10. Since n is even, let's see.

---------------

 Let me note that n can be written as 2k where k is a positive integer, so n can be 2,4,6,... So

---------------

 perhaps I can express the exponent in terms of modulo 10. Since the cycle is 10, 64^n mod 100 depends on n mod 10. Since

---------------

 n is even, n mod 10 can be 2,4,6,8,0. Wait, but 

---------------

10 divides the cycle length, so for any even n, n mod 10 can be 0,2,4,6,8. Hmm

---------------

, but since n is even, but it's any even positive integer, so n can be 2,4,6,... So perhaps

---------------

 I need to see the value of 64^n mod 100 for even exponents. Let me see:



---------------

Looking back at the powers of 64 mod 100:

n=1:64

n=2:96

n=3:44

n=4:16

n=5:24

n=6:36

n=7:4

n=8:56

n=9:84

n=10:76

n=11:64



---------------

So when n is even:

n=2:96

n=4:16

n=6:36

n=8:56

n=10:76

n=12: same

---------------

 as n=2 (since cycle is 10, so 12 mod10=2, so 64^12 mod100=96 again)

So

---------------

 the even exponents cycle every 5 terms? Let's see the even exponents:

At n=2:96

n=4:16

n=6:36

n=8:56

n=10:76

n=12:96 again

Yes, so every 5 even exponents, the cycle repeats. Since

---------------

 n is even, we can write n=2m, so m is an integer from 1 upwards. Then the exponent in

---------------

 64^n is 2m. So the cycle for m would be 5? Because when m=1 (n=2) gives 96, m=2 (n=4) gives 16, m=3 (n=6) gives 36, m=4 (n=8) gives 56, m=5 (n=10) gives 76, m=6 (n=12) gives back to 96. So the cycle length for m is 5. Therefore, for 

---------------

64^{2m} mod 100, the cycle is every 5 terms. So depending on m mod5, the value cycles every 5. Hmm

---------------

, so maybe I need to find 64^{2m} mod100 as a function of m mod5? 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe instead of breaking it down like that, since n is even, let me consider the exponent as 2k, so 64^{2k} mod100. Let

---------------

 me see if I can find a pattern here. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute 64^n mod100 where n is even. Since the cycle for 64^n mod100 is 10, then

---------------

 for even n, since n can be 2,4,6,8,..., the cycle would be 5 terms

---------------

 as above. But perhaps since n is even, the exponent can be represented as 2k, so n mod10 is

---------------

 equivalent to 2k mod10. Since k can be any integer, 2k mod10 cycles through 0,2,4,6,8. So

---------------

 for n=2k, n mod10 can be 0,2,4,6,8. Wait, but n

---------------

 is even, so n mod10 can be 0,2,4,6,8. So perhaps for n

---------------

 even, 64^n mod100 cycles every 5 terms as above. So depending on n mod10, which is 

---------------

0,2,4,6,8, the value cycles through 76,96,16,36,56.

---------------

 Wait, let's see:

Wait, when n=10 (mod10), which is 0 mod10, then

---------------

 64^10 mod100 is 76.

n=2 mod10 (like n=2,12, etc.),

---------------

 64^2 mod100 is 96.

n=4 mod10 (4,14, etc.), 64^4 mod100 is 16.

n=6 mod10 (6,16, etc.), 64^6 mod100 is 36.

n=8 mod10 (8,18, etc.), 64^8 mod100 is 56.

So if

---------------

 n is even, the exponent mod10 can be 0,2,4,6,8, so the residues

---------------

 for 64^n mod100 are 76,96,16,36,56 respectively. 



---------------

Hmm, so perhaps I need to find 64^n mod100 in terms of n mod10. But since n is even, but

---------------

 the problem states n is any even positive integer, so the expression's value mod100 may depend on n mod10? But the problem says to find the last two digits, so maybe

---------------

 the expression is the same for all even n? Wait, that might not be the case. Let me check with specific examples. Let me test with n=2 and n=4 and see if the result is the same.

Let me test n=2 first.

Case n=2:

Compute (2^{12} +26) - (6^4 -62). 

2^12 is 4096. 4096 +26 = 4122.

6^4 is 1296. 1296 -62 = 1234.

So 4122 -1234 = 2888. The last two digits are 88. 

Wait, but let me compute modulo

---------------

100 directly:

Compute each term mod100:

2^{6n} when n=2 is 2^12. 2^10=1024 mod100=24, so 2^12=2^10*2^2=24*4=96 mod100. 

So

---------------

 2^{6n} mod100=96. 

26 mod100=26. 

Then 6^{2n}=6^4. 6^4=1296 mod100=96. 

62 mod100=62. 

So the expression mod100: (96 +26) - (96 -62) = (122) - (34) = 122 -34 =88 mod100. 

So that

---------------

 gives 88. 

Now let's try n=4. 

n=4:

2^{6*4}=2^24. Let me compute 2^24 mod100. 

Alternatively

---------------

, 2^10=24 mod100, so 2^20=(2^10)^2=24^2=576 mod100=76. 

Then 2^24=2^20 * 2^4 =76*16=1216 mod100=16. 

So 2^{24} mod100=16. 

6^{2*4}=6^8. Let me compute 6^8 mod100. 

6^1=6, 6^2=36, 6^3=216 mod100=16, 6^4=16*6=96 mod100, 6^5=96*6=576 mod100=76, 6^6=76*6=456 mod100=56, 6^7=56*6=336 mod100=36, 6^8=36*6=216 mod100=16. 

Wait, so 6^8 mod100 is 16. 

So the

---------------

 expression is (16 +26) - (16 -62). 

Compute each part: 16+26=42; 16 -62= -46. So 42 - (-46)=42+46=88 mod100. 

Hmm, so

---------------

 again 88. Interesting. 

Let me try n=6. 

n=6:

2^{6*6}=2^36 mod100. Let's see. 

Since

---------------

 2^10≡24 mod100, so 2^20≡76, 2^30≡24*76 mod100? Wait, 

---------------

2^30 = (2^10)^3=24^3. 24^2=576 mod100=76, so 24*76=1824 mod100=24. Wait, so

---------------

 2^30 ≡24 mod100. 

Then 2^36 =2^30 *2^6=24*(64)=1536 mod100=36. 

So 2^{36} mod100=36. 

6^{12} mod100. Let me compute 6^12. Since 6^4=96, 6^8=16, so 6^12=6^8 *6^4=16*96 mod100. 

16*96=1536 mod100=36. 

So 6^{12} mod100=36. 

Thus

---------------

 the expression is (36 +26) - (36 -62). 

36+26=62; 36-62= -26. So 62 - (-26)=88 mod100. 

Again 88. 

Hmm, so for

---------------

 n=2,4,6, the result is 88. Let me check n=8 just to be thorough.

n=8:

2^{48} mod100. Let's see. 

2^40 would

---------------

 be (2^10)^4=24^4. Let me compute 24^2=576 mod100=76, so 24^4=(76)^2=5776 mod100=76. 

Thus

---------------

, 2^40 ≡76 mod100. 

Then 2^48 =2^40 *2^8. 2^8=256 mod100=56. 

So 76*56=4256 mod100=56. 

So 2^{48} mod100=56. 

6^{16} mod100. Since 6^4=96, 6^8=16, 6^12=36, 6^16=6^8 *6^8=16*16=256 mod100=56. 

So 6^{16} mod100=56. 

Therefore

---------------

, the expression is (56 +26) - (56 -62). 

56+26=82; 56-62= -6. 

So 82 - (-6)=88 mod100. 

Same result again. 

Hmm, so all

---------------

 these examples give 88. So maybe regardless of n (as long as it's even), the expression mod100 is 88. Therefore, the last two digits are 88. 

But let me confirm

---------------

 with another example where n=10. 

n=10:

2^{60} mod100. 

2^10=24 mod100. So 2^60=(2^10)^6. Let's compute 24^6 mod100. 

24^2=576 mod100=76



---------------

24^3=24*76=1824 mod100=24

24^4=24*24=576 mod100=76

24^5=24*76=1824 mod100=24

24^6=24*24=576 mod100=76. 

Wait, so 24^6 mod100=76. 

Therefore, 2^60 mod100=76. 

6^{20} mod100. Let's see:

6^4=96, 6^5=76, 6^10= (6^5)^2=76^2=5776 mod100=76, so 6^20=(6^10)^2=76^2=5776 mod100=76. 

Therefore, 6^{20} mod100=76. 

So the expression is (76 +26) - (76 -62). 

76+26=102 mod100=2; 76-62=14. 

Wait, so 102 -14 = 88 mod100. 

Wait, 

---------------

102 -14 is 88, yes. 

So again 88. 

Okay, so all

---------------

 these examples give 88, so I think the last two digits are always 88 regardless of the even n. Therefore the answer is 88. 

But let me think again

---------------

 if there's a mathematical way to see why this is the case. Let's try to compute (2^{6n} -6^{2n} +88) mod100. Let me see if 2^{6n} -6^{2n} mod100 is congruent to 0 mod100, so that adding 88 gives 88 mod100. Wait, in the examples above, 2^{6n} mod100 -6^{2n} mod100 was 96-96=0 (for n=2), 16-16=0 (n=4), 36-36=0 (n=6), 56-56=0 (n=8), 76-76=0 (n=10). So indeed

---------------

, 2^{6n} mod100 is equal to 6^{2n} mod100 when n is even. Therefore, their difference mod100 is 0, so the total expression is 0 +88 mod100=88. 

Therefore, the key insight is that 2^{6n} ≡ 6^{2n} mod100 when n is even. Let me verify that.



---------------

Let me note that 2^{6n} = (2^6)^n = 64^n. 

6^{2n} = (6^2)^n = 36^n. 

Wait, but in the examples above, 64^n mod100 was equal to 36^{n} mod100? Wait, hold

---------------

 on, no. Wait, in the first example, n=2:

64^2 mod100= (64)^2=4096 mod100=96. 

36^2 mod100=1296 mod100=96. 

Similarly

---------------

, n=4:

64^4 mod100= (64)^4. Let me compute 64^2=4096 mod100=96, then 96^2=9216 mod100=16. So 64^4 mod100=16. 

36^4 mod100: 36^2=1296 mod100=96; 96^2=9216 mod100=16. 

So same result. 

Similarly, 64^6 mod100: 64^3 mod100=

---------------

64*64^2=64*96 mod100. 64*96=6144 mod100=44. Wait, but 36^3 mod100:

---------------

 36*36=1296 mod100=96; 36^3=36*96 mod100=3456 mod100=56. Wait, hold

---------------

 on, that contradicts earlier examples?

Wait, wait, in the case n=6, 6^{2n}=6^{12}=36^6 mod100. Wait, let

---------------

's compute 36^6 mod100. 

Wait, 36^1=36 mod100

36^2=1296 mod100=96

36^3=36*96=3456 mod100=56

36^4=36*56=2016 mod100=16

36^5=36*16=576 mod100=76

36^6=36*76=2736 mod100=36. 

Wait, so 36^6 mod100 is 36. 

Meanwhile

---------------

, 64^6 mod100. Let me compute 64^3 mod100 first: 64*64=4096 mod100=96, so 64^3=64*96=6144 mod100=44. Then 64^6=(64^3)^2=44^2=1936 mod100=36. 

Ah, okay, so 64^6 mod100 is 36, same as 36^6 mod100. 

Wait, so in

---------------

 general, 64^n mod100 = 36^n mod100 when n is even? Let me check that

---------------

. Let me see:

Note that 64 ≡ -36 mod100. Because 64 +36=100. So 64 ≡ -36 mod100. Therefore, 64^n ≡ (-36)^n mod100. 

If n is even, then (-36)^n = (36)^n mod100. Therefore, 64^n ≡36^n mod100 when n is even. 

Ah! That's the key point. Since n is even, 64^n ≡ (-36)^n = (36)^n mod100. Therefore, 64^n -36^n ≡0 mod100 when n is even. Therefore, the expression (64^n -36^n +88) mod100 =0 +88 mod100=88 mod100. 

Therefore, regardless of the even n, the expression will always be 88 mod100. So the last two digits are 88. 

That

---------------

's a much simpler way. I should have thought of that earlier. Since 64 and -36 are congruent mod100, so when raised to an even power, they become the same as 36^n. Therefore, their difference is 0 mod100, so adding 88 gives 88. 

Therefore, the answer is 88.

**Final Answer**
Answer: 88


To find the last two digits of \((2^{6n} + 26) - (6^{2n} - 62)\) where \(n\) is a positive even number, we start by simplifying the expression:

\[
(2^{6n} + 26) - (6^{2n} - 62) = 2^{6n} + 26 - 6^{2n} + 62 = 2^{6n} - 6^{2n} + 88
\]

We need to compute this expression modulo 100. 

First, note that \(2^{6n} = (2^6)^n = 64^n\) and \(6^{2n} = (6^2)^n = 36^n\). Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
64^n - 36^n + 88 \pmod{100}
\]

Since \(n\) is even, let \(n = 2k\) for some integer \(k\). We observe that \(64 \equiv -36 \pmod{100}\). Therefore, raising both sides to the power of \(n\) (which is even):

\[
64^n \equiv (-36)^n \equiv 36^n \pmod{100}
\]

This implies:

\[
64^n - 36^n \equiv 36^n - 36^n \equiv 0 \pmod{100}
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
0 + 88 \equiv 88 \pmod{100}
\]

Therefore, the last two digits of \((2^{6n} + 26) - (6^{2n} - 62)\) are \(\boxed{88}\).
