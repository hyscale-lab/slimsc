Okay, let's see. The problem is about Yan being somewhere between his home and the stadium. He can either go directly to the stadium or go home first and then ride his bicycle to the stadium. The key points here are that his biking speed is 7 times his walking speed, and both routes take the same amount of time. We need to find the ratio of his current distance from home to his distance from the stadium, expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then give m + n.

Hmm. Let me start by visualizing the scenario. Let me imagine a straight line between Yan's home and the stadium. Yan is somewhere in between. Let's denote his current position as a point between home and stadium. Let me assign some variables here.

Let me call:
- Let d be the distance from Yan's current position to his home.
- Let s be the distance from Yan's current position to the stadium.
So the total distance between home and stadium would then be d + s.

Now, he has two options:
1. Walk directly to the stadium. The distance for this is s, and since he's walking, the time taken would be distance divided by his walking speed. Let's denote his walking speed as v. So time1 = s / v.

2. Walk home first, which is a distance of d, then ride his bicycle from home to the stadium. The biking speed is 7 times walking, so biking speed is 7v. The total distance for this route is d (walking home) plus (d + s) (biking from home to stadium). Wait, hold on. Wait, if he walks home, that's distance d at speed v, taking time d / v. Then from home to stadium is distance (d + s), right? Because the total distance between home and stadium is d + s. So the biking part would take (d + s) / (7v). So total time for the second option is (d / v) + ((d + s)/(7v)). 

Since both times are equal, set them equal:

s / v = (d / v) + ( (d + s) / (7v) )

Hmm, since all terms have 1/v, we can multiply both sides by v to eliminate denominators:

s = d + (d + s)/7

Let me write that equation again:

s = d + (d + s)/7

Let

---------------

 me solve for the ratio d/s. Let me denote r = d/s. That way, d = r*s. Maybe substituting that in would help. Let me try that.

So substituting d = r*s into the equation:

s = (r*s) + ( (r*s + s) ) /7

Factor s out where possible. Let's see:

Left side: s

Right side: r*s + (s*(r + 1))/7

So:

s = s [ r + (r + 1)/7 ]

Divide both sides by s (assuming s ≠ 0, which makes sense here):

1 = r + (r + 1)/7

Multiply both sides by 7 to eliminate denominator:

7 = 7r + r + 1

Combine like terms:

7 = 8r + 1

Subtract 1:

6 = 8r

Therefore, r = 6/8 = 3/4.

Wait, but r is d/s, so the ratio of Yan's distance from home (d) to his distance from the stadium (s) is 3/4? So the ratio is 3/4, so m is 3, n is 4, so m + n = 7?

Wait a second, let me verify this

---------------

 again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting over with the equation:

Original equation after multiplying by v:

s = d + (d + s)/7

Let me bring

---------------

 all terms to one side:

s - d - (d + s)/7 = 0

Multiply through by 7 to eliminate denominator:

7s - 7d - (d + s) = 0

7s -7d -d - s = 0

Combine like terms:

(7s - s) + (-7d - d) = 0

6s -8d =0

So 6s =8d => 3s =4d => d/s = 3/4.

Yes, that seems consistent. So the ratio d/s is 3/4, so the answer is 3 + 4 =7.

Wait, but hold on, the problem says "the ratio of Yan's distance from his home to his distance from the stadium". So that's d:s, so d/s is 3/4. So yes, 3/4, so m + n is 7. Hmm. But let me check again

---------------

 with different variables to see if another approach gives the same result.

Alternative approach: Let me let the distance from home to stadium be D. Let Yan's current position be x distance from home, so his distance from stadium is D - x. Then, the two options:

1. Direct walk to stadium: time = (D - x)/v

2. Walk home (distance x at speed v), then bike from home to stadium (distance D at 7v). So time = x/v + D/(7v)

Set equal:

(D - x)/v = x/v + D/(7v)

Multiply both sides by v:

D - x = x + D/7

Bring variables to one side:

D - D/7 = x + x

(6D/7) = 2x

Thus, x = (6D)/(14) = (3D)/7

So x is 3/7 of the total distance from home to stadium. Therefore, his distance from home is 3D/7, and distance from stadium is D - 3D/7 = 4D/7. So the ratio of home distance to stadium distance is (3D/7)/(4D/7) = 3/4. So same result. So that

---------------

's correct.

Therefore the answer is 3 +4 =7. So I think that's correct.

Wait, just to be

---------------

 thorough, let me plug numbers. Suppose total distance D is 7 km (random choice for ease). Then x = 3 km from home, so 4 km from stadium.

Time to go directly: 4 km at speed v, time is 4/v.

Time to go home then bike: 3/v + 7/(7v) = 3/v +1/v =4/v. So equal. Perfect, that works. So the

---------------

 ratio is 3/4. So answer is 7. 

So I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes here. The key was setting up the equation correctly, making sure the times are equal, and then solving for the ratio. Both variable approaches gave

---------------

 same result, and numerical example confirmed. So yeah, 7 is the answer.

**Final Answer**
Answer: 7


Let \( d \) be the distance from Yan's current position to his home, and \( s \) be the distance from his current position to the stadium. The total distance between home and the stadium is \( d + s \).

Yan has two options:
1. Walk directly to the stadium, which takes time \( \frac{s}{v} \).
2. Walk home and then bike to the stadium. The time for this is \( \frac{d}{v} + \frac{d + s}{7v} \).

Since both times are equal, we set up the equation:
\[
\frac{s}{v} = \frac{d}{v} + \frac{d + s}{7v}
\]

Multiplying through by \( v \) to clear the denominators:
\[
s = d + \frac{d + s}{7}
\]

Multiply both sides by 7 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
7s = 7d + d + s
\]

Simplifying:
\[
7s = 8d + s
\]
\[
6s = 8d
\]
\[
\frac{d}{s} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

Thus, the ratio of Yan's distance from his home to his distance from the stadium is \( \frac{3}{4} \). The values \( m = 3 \) and \( n = 4 \) are coprime, so \( m + n = 3 + 4 = 7 \).
