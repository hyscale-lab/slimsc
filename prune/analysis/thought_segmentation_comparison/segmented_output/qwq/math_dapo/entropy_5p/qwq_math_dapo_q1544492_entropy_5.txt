Okay, so Edward is trying to escape from prison, and he's 1,875 feet away from the prison when he stops to rest. Then a guard spots him and shoots an arrow with an initial velocity of 100 feet per second. At the same time the guard shoots, Edward starts running away with an acceleration of 1 foot per second squared. The arrow is decelerating at 1 foot per second squared because of air resistance. We need to find out how fast the arrow is going when it hits Edward.

Hmm, let me think. Both Edward and the arrow are moving, but with different accelerations. Edward is accelerating, while the arrow is decelerating. Since they start at the same time, we need to figure out the time when their positions coincide, and then find the speed of the arrow at that time.

First, let me recall the kinematic equations. For an object with initial velocity v0 and acceleration a, the position at time t is given by:

s(t) = s0 + v0*t + 0.5*a*t²

But here

---------------

, Edward is starting from rest but with acceleration, and the arrow has an initial velocity but is decelerating.

Let me set up coordinate systems. Let's say the prison is at position 0, and Edward is at 1,875 feet when he stops. So when the guard shoots the arrow, Edward is at position x = 1,875 feet, and he starts moving away from the prison (so in the positive direction). The arrow is fired from the prison (position 0) towards Edward, so the arrow is moving in the positive direction as well.

Wait, actually, the

---------------

 problem says Edward had to escape from prison to work in the grading room today, so he was moving away from the prison. But

---------------

 when he stopped to rest, he was 1,875 feet away. So the guard is at the prison, which is the starting point. The arrow is shot towards Edward, who is 1,875 feet away and starts running away when

---------------

 the arrow is fired.

Therefore, Edward's position as a function of time is his starting position plus his motion. Since he starts from rest but accelerates at 1 ft/s², his position at time t is:

Edward's position: s_E(t) = 1,875 + 0.5 * a_E * t², where a_E = 1 ft/s². So s_E(t) = 1875 + 0.5 * 1 * t² = 1875 + 0.5 t².

The arrow's position is starting from 0, with initial velocity 100 ft/s but decelerating at 1 ft/s². So its acceleration is -1 ft/s². The arrow's position is:

s_A(t) = v0_A * t + 0.5 * a_A * t² = 100*t + 0.5*(-1)*t² = 100t - 0.5 t².

We need to find the time t when s_A(t) = s_E(t). That is:

100t - 0.5 t² = 1875 + 0.5 t²

Let me rearrange this equation to solve for t:

100t - 0.5 t² - 1875 - 0.5 t² = 0

Combine like terms:

100t - (0.5 + 0.5) t² - 1875 = 0

So 100t - t² - 1875 = 0

Rearranged:

-t² + 100t - 1875 = 0

Multiply both sides by -1 to make the quadratic coefficient positive:

t² - 100t + 1875 = 0

Now we can solve this quadratic equation for t. Let's see if it factors, or we

---------------

 can use the quadratic formula.

Quadratic formula: t = [100 ± sqrt(100² - 4*1*1875)] / (2*1)

Compute discriminant D = 10000 - 7500 = 2500.

sqrt(2500) = 50.

So t = [100 ± 50]/2.

Thus two solutions:

t = (100 + 50)/2 = 150/2 = 75 seconds,

and t = (100 - 50)/2 = 50/2 = 25 seconds.

Hmm, so two times when their positions coincide. But since the arrow is decelerating and Edward is accelerating, perhaps

---------------

 the first time is when the arrow catches up, but maybe after that, the arrow slows down and Edward gets ahead again? Wait, but the problem states that the arrow does hit Edward, so we

---------------

 need to take the correct time when that happens.

Wait, but let's check both times. Let's see.

At t = 25 seconds:

Compute positions.

Edward: 1875 + 0.5*(25)^2 = 1875 + 0.5*625 = 1875 + 312.5 = 2187.5 feet.

Arrow: 100*25 - 0.5*(25)^2 = 2500 - 0.5*625 = 2500 - 312.5 = 2187.5 feet. So that's correct.

At t = 75 seconds:

Edward: 1875 + 0.5*(75)^2 = 1875 + 0.5*5625 = 1875 + 2812.5 = 4687.5 feet.

Arrow: 100*75 - 0.5*(75)^2 = 7500 - 0.5*5625 = 7500 - 2812.5 = 4687.5 feet. So that's also correct.

Hmm, so the

---------------

 arrow hits Edward twice? But that can't be. Wait, maybe the arrow is going away from the prison? Wait, no, the arrow is fired towards Edward, so the

---------------

 initial direction is away from the prison? Wait, no. Wait, Edward is 1,875 feet away from the prison. The guard is at the prison, so to shoot at Edward, the arrow is fired in the direction of Edward, so the

---------------

 arrow's initial direction is towards Edward, so the arrow's position is moving from 0 to Edward's position. So the

---------------

 arrow is moving forward, but decelerating. So at t=25, the arrow catches Edward. Then, after

---------------

 that, the arrow continues moving forward but slowing down, while Edward is accelerating. Wait, but Edward is accelerating, so maybe after t=25, Edward starts to get

---------------

 further away, but the arrow is still moving forward, but maybe at some point, the arrow stops and starts going back? Wait, no

---------------

. The arrow's acceleration is -1 ft/s², so its velocity is decreasing by 1 ft/s each second. The arrow's velocity is

---------------

 v_A(t) = v0 + a*t = 100 -1*t. So when does the arrow stop? When velocity is zero: 100 - t = 0 => t=100 seconds. So the arrow comes

---------------

 to rest at t=100, then starts moving back towards the prison with negative velocity. But Edward is moving away, so after

---------------

 t=25, the arrow is still moving forward (since velocity is still positive until t=100), but Edward

---------------

 is also moving forward. So between t=25 and t=100, the arrow is still moving forward, but slower

---------------

 each second, while Edward is accelerating. So maybe at t=75, the arrow catches up again? But that seems counterintuitive.

Wait, let

---------------

 me think again. The arrow's position at t=25 is 2187.5, and then at t=75 it's 4687.5. Edward's position at t=25 is 2187.5, and at t=75 is 4687.5. So between

---------------

 t=25 and t=75, the arrow continues moving forward, but Edward is also moving forward, but perhaps

---------------

 the arrow is moving faster than Edward's speed during that time? Let's check their velocities at t=25 and t=75.

First, Edward's velocity: since he's accelerating at 1 ft/s², his velocity at time t is v_E(t) = a*t = 1*t. So at t=25, his speed is 25 ft/s; at t=75, it's 75 ft/s.

The arrow's velocity is v_A(t) = 100 - t. So at t=25, velocity

---------------

 is 75 ft/s; at t=75, it's 25 ft/s.

So at t=25, arrow is moving at 75 ft/s, Edward at 25 ft/s. So arrow is faster, so after that, arrow continues moving forward but slowing down, while Edward is speeding up. So

---------------

 after t=25, Edward's speed is increasing, and the arrow's speed is decreasing. The question is, does the arrow's

---------------

 position ever overtake Edward again?

Wait, at t=25, they are at the same position. Then, for

---------------

 t between 25 and 75, let's see:

Let me pick a time between, say, t=50.

Edward's position: 1875 + 0.5*(50)^2 = 1875 + 1250 = 3125.

Arrow's position: 100*50 - 0.5*(50)^2 = 5000 - 1250 = 3750. Wait, so that's higher

---------------

 than Edward's position. So the arrow is ahead of Edward at t=50. Hmm, so that suggests that between t=25 and t=75, the arrow is actually moving ahead of Edward again? Wait, but at

---------------

 t=75, they meet again. So the arrow goes past Edward at t=25, then moves further away, but then Edward catches up again at t=75? Wait, but Edward is accelerating, so his

---------------

 velocity is increasing, so maybe after some point, Edward's velocity surpasses the arrow's, so he can catch up again?

Wait, let me think again

---------------

. The arrow's velocity is decreasing linearly from 100 to 0, while Edward's velocity is increasing linearly from 0 to 75 at t=75. So the

---------------

 arrow's velocity is 75 at t=25, and Edward's is 25. Then at t=50, arrow's velocity is 50, Edward's is 50. So their velocities are equal at t=50. After

---------------

 that, Edward is going faster than the arrow. So from t=50 onwards, Edward is accelerating past the arrow's speed, so he can start catching up. So

---------------

 between t=25 and t=50, the arrow is moving faster than Edward, so it gets ahead. Then from t=50 to t=75, Edward is moving faster, so he catches up again at t=75. That's why there are two intersection

---------------

 points.

But the problem states "the arrow does hit Edward". So we need to figure out which of these two times is the actual impact. Since the guard fires the arrow, presumably the first time the

---------------

 arrow reaches Edward is the hit. The second time would be Edward catching up to the arrow again after the arrow has passed him. But the

---------------

 problem says the arrow does hit Edward, so the first time (t=25) is when the arrow hits him. The

---------------

 second time would be Edward running into the arrow again, but since the arrow is slowing down, maybe that's a second hit? But the

---------------

 problem says "assuming that it does hit Edward"—so maybe both are valid? Hmm, maybe the problem is set up so that the

---------------

 arrow only hits once, but the math shows two times. Wait, perhaps the arrow cannot go beyond Edward once it's hit

---------------

 him? Wait, but the problem says to assume it does hit, so maybe both are possible, but we have to see which one is physically meaningful.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 when the arrow hits Edward at t=25, that's the impact. The second time would be after the arrow has passed him and Edward catches up again, but that

---------------

 would require the arrow to have passed him, which might not be considered a hit from behind. But the problem says "how fast was the arrow moving at the moment of impact". Since the problem states that the arrow does hit Edward, maybe

---------------

 both are possible, but perhaps the question expects the first time. Let me check the problem again.

Wait the problem says Edward started running away when the arrow was fired. So the

---------------

 guard fires the arrow at the same time Edward starts running. So the guard is trying to shoot Edward who is fleeing. So the arrow is going towards Edward, so the first time they meet (t=25) is when the arrow reaches Edward. The second time would be Edward running

---------------

 so fast that he catches up to the arrow again after the arrow has passed him and is slowing down. But since the arrow is moving

---------------

 away from the prison, and Edward is moving away, the arrow would have to slow down enough for Edward to catch up again. But

---------------

 in that case, the arrow would have to be moving slower than Edward's speed. Since Edward's speed at t=75 is 75 ft/s, while the arrow's speed is 25 ft/s, so Edward is going faster. So after

---------------

 t=50, Edward is faster, so he can catch up again. So that second collision would be Edward running into the arrow from behind? That

---------------

's a bit odd, but possible in the equations.

However, the problem says "the arrow does hit Edward"—so perhaps the

---------------

 first impact is the one intended here. The problem might be expecting us to take the first time, t=25, so the answer would be the arrow's speed at t=25, which is 100 -25 = 75 ft/s.

But let me check

---------------

 the problem statement again. It says "how fast was the arrow moving at the moment of impact". Since the problem says "assuming that it does hit Edward", maybe

---------------

 both are possible, but we need to see which one is valid.

Wait, perhaps the arrow can't hit Edward the second time because after the first hit, the arrow would have already passed him, so maybe

---------------

 the first hit is the only one. But actually, in physics, if two objects pass each other, they can meet again if their motions allow it. However

---------------

, in this case, once the arrow hits Edward at t=25, maybe the arrow stops or something, but the problem doesn't mention that. The problem just says the arrow decelerates at 1 ft/s². So if

---------------

 we take the equations at face value, there are two times when their positions coincide, so the problem must specify which one. But since it's a

---------------

 math problem, maybe we need to consider both and see which makes sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the first time.

---------------

 Let me see the numbers. Let me compute the speed at both times.

At t=25, the arrow's speed is 100 -25 =75 ft/s.

At t=75, the arrow's speed is 100 -75 =25 ft/s.

So

---------------

 the question is, which is the correct time? Since Edward starts at 1,875 feet, and the arrow is fired from 0, the first time the

---------------

 arrow reaches him is t=25. The second time would be after the arrow has overshot and Edward catches up again. But in

---------------

 real terms, once the arrow hits Edward at t=25, it might not continue, but since the problem says "assuming that it does hit Edward", maybe both

---------------

 are valid, but perhaps the problem expects the first time. However, let me see if the problem mentions anything else. It says Edward had to escape from prison to work in the grading room today, so maybe he needs

---------------

 to get there, so the arrow hits him on the way, so the first impact is when he is fleeing, so 75 ft/s. Alternatively, maybe the problem

---------------

 expects the second time? Wait, but why would the problem give such a distance?

Wait, let me check the distance at t=25 is

---------------

 2187.5 feet from prison. So Edward was 1,875 feet away, and then

---------------

 he ran another 312.5 feet. The arrow traveled 2187.5 feet in 25 seconds. That

---------------

 seems reasonable. The second time, he is 4,687.5 feet away, so he ran an additional 2,500 feet in

---------------

 the next 50 seconds. That seems like a lot, but with acceleration, maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed so that the answer is 25, but that would be at t=75. Hmm, perhaps I made an error in setting up the equations.

Wait let me re-express the equations again to check

---------------

.

Edward's position: starting at 1,875 feet, with acceleration 1 ft/s². Since he starts from rest, his position is 1875 + 0.5 * 1 * t².

Arrow's position: starting from 0, initial velocity 100 ft/s, deceleration 1 ft/s². So position

---------------

 is 100t - 0.5 *1 *t².

Setting equal:

100t - 0.5 t² = 1875 + 0.5 t²

Moving

---------------

 all terms to left:

100t -0.5 t² -1875 -0.5 t² =0 → 100t - t² -1875=0 → -t² +100 t -1875 =0 → t² -100 t +1875=0 → quadratic

---------------

 equation.

Solutions at t=(100 ±√(10000-7500))/2 → √2500=50, so t=(100±50)/2 → 75 or 25. So that's correct.

Hmm, so perhaps

---------------

 the problem is expecting the second time? Wait, but why?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the direction of acceleration. Wait, Edward is running away, so his acceleration is in the same direction as his motion. The arrow's deceleration is opposite to its velocity, so since it's moving in the positive direction (towards Edward), its acceleration is negative. That part seems okay.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is

---------------

 a trick question where the answer is 25, but I need to see.

Wait, let's think of the total

---------------

 distance. The guard is at 0, Edward starts at 1,875. The arrow is fired towards him. The first

---------------

 time they meet, the arrow has to cover the 1,875 plus the distance Edward ran. So at t=25, Edward has moved 0.5*1*(25)^2 = 312.5, so total distance from prison is 1,875 +312.5=2,187.5. The arrow traveled 100*25 -0.5*1*(25)^2=2,500 - 312.5=2,187.5. So that works.

At

---------------

 t=75, Edward is 1,875 +0.5*1*(75)^2=1,875 + 2,812.5=4,687.5. The arrow is

---------------

 at 100*75 -0.5*1*(75)^2=7,500 -2,812.5=4,687.5. So that's correct.

So

---------------

 both are valid. But the problem says "assuming that it does hit Edward"—so maybe both are possible, but the question is which

---------------

 one is the answer.

Wait, the problem might be expecting the first impact, so the answer is 75. But maybe

---------------

 in the problem's context, since Edward is trying to escape, the guard would shoot to hit him as soon as possible, so the first time is the one

---------------

. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that the answer is 25, but that would be the second time. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I need

---------------

 to check which of these times the arrow is still moving towards Edward. Wait, at t=25, the arrow is moving at 75 ft/s (since

---------------

 velocity is 100 -25=75), which is in the positive direction (same as Edward's direction). So the arrow is moving away from the prison towards Edward, hits

---------------

 him, then continues moving forward but slowing down. So at t=25, the arrow is still moving in the direction of Edward, so that is a hit

---------------

. Then at t=75, the arrow is moving at 25 ft/s, still in the positive direction, but Edward is now moving faster. So Edward

---------------

 catches up to the arrow from behind, so the arrow is moving in the same direction as Edward, but slower, so Edward runs into the arrow from behind. That

---------------

 could also be considered a hit. But perhaps the problem considers only the first impact as the hit, since the arrow was fired towards Edward. The second impact would be Edward overtaking the arrow.

The

---------------

 problem states that Edward "had to escape from prison to work in the grading room today. He stopped to rest at a place 1,875 feet from the prison and was spotted by a guard with a crossbow." So the guard shoots when Edward is resting 

---------------

1,875 feet away, and Edward starts running when the arrow is shot. So the guard's intention is to shoot Edward while he's fleeing. The first hit occurs at 25 seconds, when the arrow catches up. The second hit would be after Edward has outrun the arrow's speed, and

---------------

 then catches up to it again. But since the problem says "how fast was the arrow moving at the moment of impact", and doesn

---------------

't specify which impact, but since it's a math problem, perhaps both are possible, but the quadratic has two solutions, so maybe we need to see

---------------

 which is physically meaningful.

Alternatively, maybe the arrow can't hit Edward twice. If the arrow hits Edward at t=25, then perhaps it stops or something

---------------

, so the second solution is extraneous. But the problem says to assume it does hit Edward, so maybe both are valid, but the

---------------

 question is likely expecting the first time. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the answer is 25, but that would be the second time. Wait, but

---------------

 why?

Wait, let me check the problem again: "how fast was the arrow moving at the moment of impact (in ft/s)?" Since

---------------

 the problem is from a math competition or similar, maybe the answer is 25. Wait, but why? Let me think again

---------------

.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup. Let me re-express the equations again:

Edward's position:

---------------

 s_E(t) = 1875 + 0.5*a*t² where a=1, so 1875 + 0.5t².

Arrow's position: s_A(t) = v0*t + 0.5*a*t² where v0=100, a=-1, so 100t -0.5t².

Set equal: 100t -0.5t² = 1875 +0.5t² → 100t - t² = 1875 → t² -100t +1875=0 → solutions

---------------

 t=25 and t=75.

Thus, the two times are valid. Since the problem states that the arrow does hit Edward, both

---------------

 are possible, but we need to determine which is the correct one.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to take the smaller

---------------

 time, 25, so the answer would be 75 ft/s. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that the answer is 25 ft/s, which would correspond to t=75. Maybe

---------------

 I need to see which makes sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to check if at t=75, the arrow is still moving forward. Since velocity

---------------

 is 25 ft/s, which is positive, so it's still moving away from the prison. Edward is moving at 75 ft/s. So Edward is moving faster, so he catches up. So

---------------

 the impact at t=75 is Edward running into the arrow from behind. So in that case, the arrow's speed relative to Edward would be (25 -75)= -50 ft/s, but the question just asks the arrow's speed, not relative speed, so it's 25 ft/s.

But the

---------------

 problem says "how fast was the arrow moving at the moment of impact"—so it's the speed of the arrow in the ground frame, so 

---------------

25 or 75. Since both are possible, but the problem states "escape from prison", so perhaps the first time is the actual

---------------

 hit, so 75. Alternatively, maybe the problem is set so that the answer is 25, but I

---------------

 need to see.

Alternatively, let's see the total distance. At t=25, arrow has traveled 2187.5 ft. At

---------------

 t=75, 4687.5. Since Edward was initially 1,875 away, so first

---------------

 impact is when the arrow catches him as he's fleeing, second is after he's gotten much further away. The problem might want

---------------

 the first impact, so the answer is 75. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to compute

---------------

 both and see which one is an answer choice, but since this is open response, the problem might have a unique answer. Let me check units

---------------

 and equations again.

Wait, the problem says Edward had to escape from prison to work in the grading room today. He stopped to rest at a place 1,875 feet from the prison. So he was escaping

---------------

, then stopped to rest. Then the guard spotted him and shot the arrow as Edward started running again. So the guard fires

---------------

 the arrow when Edward is 1,875 feet away, and Edward starts running at that moment. So the arrow is shot towards Edward, who is 1,875 feet away and starts moving away. So the guard is

---------------

 trying to hit Edward as he flees. The first time the arrow reaches him is the earliest possible hit, so that's the

---------------

 intended one. The second time is after Edward has gotten much further, but since Edward is accelerating, maybe the guard would prefer to hit him earlier. Therefore

---------------

, the first impact at t=25 is the one intended here, so the answer is 75 ft/s.

Alternatively, perhaps I need

---------------

 to confirm by plugging in t=25 into the arrow's velocity equation: v = 100 - t = 75. So

---------------

 that's the answer. So I think that's the right approach.

**Final Answer**
Answer: 75


Edward is 1,875 feet away from the prison when he stops to rest. The guard fires an arrow with an initial velocity of 100 ft/s, which decelerates at 1 ft/s². Edward starts running away with an acceleration of 1 ft/s². We need to find the speed of the arrow when it hits Edward.

Edward's position as a function of time is given by:
\[
s_E(t) = 1875 + 0.5 \cdot 1 \cdot t^2 = 1875 + 0.5t^2
\]

The arrow's position as a function of time is given by:
\[
s_A(t) = 100t - 0.5 \cdot 1 \cdot t^2 = 100t - 0.5t^2
\]

Setting these positions equal to find the time of impact:
\[
100t - 0.5t^2 = 1875 + 0.5t^2
\]

Rearranging the equation:
\[
100t - t^2 - 1875 = 0
\]
\[
t^2 - 100t + 1875 = 0
\]

Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
\[
t = \frac{100 \pm \sqrt{100^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1875}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]
\[
t = \frac{100 \pm \sqrt{10000 - 7500}}{2}
\]
\[
t = \frac{100 \pm 50}{2}
\]

The solutions are:
\[
t = 75 \text{ seconds} \quad \text{and} \quad t = 25 \text{ seconds}
\]

We consider both times to determine the speed of the arrow. The arrow's velocity at time \( t \) is:
\[
v_A(t) = 100 - t
\]

For \( t = 25 \):
\[
v_A(25) = 100 - 25 = 75 \text{ ft/s}
\]

For \( t = 75 \):
\[
v_A(75) = 100 - 75 = 25 \text{ ft/s}
\]

The first impact occurs at \( t = 25 \) seconds when the arrow catches Edward as he starts fleeing. The second impact at \( t = 75 \) seconds would be Edward catching up to the arrow, which is less likely the intended scenario. Therefore, the speed of the arrow at the moment of impact is:
