Okay, so I need to find the values of the real parameter \( a \) such that the equation \( \sin 2x \sin 4x - \sin x \sin 3x = a \) has exactly one solution in the interval \([0, \pi)\). Hmm, trigonometric equation with parameters... Alright, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, maybe I can simplify the left-hand side of the equation using trigonometric identities. Let me recall some product-to-sum formulas. The product of sines can be converted into a sum or difference. The identity is \( \sin A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(A - B) - \cos(A + B)] \). Let me apply this to both terms in the equation.

Starting with \( \sin 2x \sin 4x \):

Let \( A = 2x \) and \( B = 4x \). Then,

\( \sin 2x \sin 4x = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(2x - 4x) - \cos(2x + 4x)] \)
= \( \frac{1}{2} [\cos(-2x) - \cos 6x] \)
Since \( \cos(-\theta) = \cos \theta \), this simplifies to:
= \( \frac{1}{2} [\cos 2x - \cos 6x] \).

Now, the second term is \( \sin x \sin 3x \). Applying the same identity:

Let \( A = x \), \( B = 3x \):

\( \sin x \sin 3x = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(x - 3x) - \cos(x + 3x)] \)
= \( \frac{1}{2} [\cos(-2x) - \cos 4x] \)
Again, \( \cos(-2x) = \cos 2x \), so:
= \( \frac{1}{2} [\cos 2x - \cos 4x] \).

So, putting both back into the original equation:

\( \sin 2x \sin 4x - \sin x \sin 3x = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 2x - \cos 6x] - \frac{1}{2} [\cos 2x - \cos 4x] \).

Let me simplify this expression step by step:

First, distribute the subtraction:

= \( \frac{1}{2} \cos 2x - \frac{1}{2} \cos 6x - \frac{1}{2} \cos 2x + \frac{1}{2} \cos 4x \)

Combine like terms. The \( \frac{1}{2} \cos 2x \) and \( -\frac{1}{2} \cos 2x \) cancel each other out:

= \( -\frac{1}{2} \cos 6x + \frac{1}{2} \cos 4x \)

So, the equation simplifies to:

\( \frac{1}{2} (\cos 4x - \cos 6x) = a \)

Hmm, maybe I can combine these cosine terms further? Let me see. There's another identity for \( \cos A - \cos B \). The identity is:

\( \cos A - \cos B = -2 \sin \left( \frac{A + B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A - B}{2} \right) \).

Let me apply that here with \( A = 4x \) and \( B = 6x \):

\( \cos 4x - \cos 6x = -2 \sin \left( \frac{4x + 6x}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{4x - 6x}{2} \right) \)
= \( -2 \sin(5x) \sin(-x) \)
But \( \sin(-x) = -\sin x \), so:

= \( -2 \sin 5x (-\sin x) \)
= \( 2 \sin 5x \sin x \)

Therefore, substituting back into the equation:

\( \frac{1}{2} (2 \sin 5x \sin x) = a \)
Simplifies to:
\( \sin 5x \sin x = a \)

Wait

---------------

 a second, that's interesting. So the original equation simplifies down to \( \sin 5x \sin x = a \). That seems simpler. Let

---------------

 me confirm that step again to make sure I didn't make an error in applying the identities.

Starting from the product terms, converted both products to sums

---------------

, subtracted them, and ended up with \( \frac{1}{2} (\cos4x - \cos6x) \). Then using

---------------

 the identity for the difference of cosines, which led to \( \sin5x \sinx \). So that's correct.

So now, the equation is \( \sin5x \sinx = a \). We

---------------

 need to find values of \( a \) such that this equation has exactly one solution in \( [0, \pi) \).

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. Since the

---------------

 equation is \( \sin5x \sinx = a \), perhaps I can analyze the function \( f(x) = \sin5x \sinx \) over the interval \( [0, \pi) \), and find the values of \( a \) where the horizontal line \( y = a \) intersects the graph of \( f(x) \) exactly once.

Therefore, to

---------------

 do this, I need to study the function \( f(x) = \sin5x \sinx \), find its extrema, and see for which \( a \) the equation has only one solution. Alternatively

---------------

, maybe express \( f(x) \) in another form to make it easier to analyze.

Alternatively, perhaps use another trigonometric identity to combine \( \sin5x \sinx \). Let me recall that \( \sin A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(A - B) - \cos(A + B)] \). Let me apply that here.

So:

\( \sin5x \sinx = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(5x - x) - \cos(5x + x)] \)
= \( \frac{1}{2} [\cos4x - \cos6x] \)

Wait, that's the same expression we had earlier. So,

---------------

 actually, that's the same as the previous step. So maybe this approach is not helpful? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps express

---------------

 \( \sin5x \sinx \) in terms of multiple angles or another form. Alternatively, expand \( \sin5x \) using multiple-angle formulas?

Let me think. \(

---------------

 \sin5x \) can be written as \( \sin(2x + 3x) \), but that might not help. Alternatively, using the identity for \( \sin5x \):

Rec

---------------

all that \( \sin5x = 16 \sin^5x - 20 \sin^3x + 5 \sinx \). Hmm, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps write

---------------

 \( \sin5x \sinx \) as a product and consider the product's graph?

Alternatively, consider the function \( f(x) = \sin5x \sinx \), and analyze its behavior over \( [0, \pi) \).

Let

---------------

 me try to analyze \( f(x) \).

First, note that \( x \) is in \( [0, \pi) \). Let's consider the function

---------------

 \( f(x) = \sin5x \sinx \). To find the number of solutions to \( f(x) = a \), we can consider

---------------

 the graph of \( f(x) \) over the interval and see where horizontal lines intersect once.

To do this effectively, I need to find the critical points of \( f(x) \), its maxima and minima, and then

---------------

 determine the values of \( a \) where the equation has only one solution. This typically occurs at the maximum or minimum values of

---------------

 the function where the horizontal line touches only one point, or perhaps at points where the function is monotonic.

Alternatively, perhaps the

---------------

 equation \( \sin5x \sinx = a \) can be transformed into another equation. Let me see if I can write this as a single sine function or something

---------------

 else.

Alternatively, maybe use substitution. Let me set \( y = x \), so the equation is \( \sin5y \sin y = a \). Hmm

---------------

, but not sure yet.

Alternatively, perhaps express \( \sin5x \) in terms of \( \sinx \), using multiple-angle identities.

Let me recall that \( \sin5x = 16 \sin^5x - 20 \sin^3x + 5 \sinx \). Therefore

---------------

, substituting into \( f(x) \):

\( f(x) = (16 \sin^5x - 20 \sin^3x + 5 \sinx) \cdot \sinx \)
= \( 16 \sin^6x - 20 \sin^4x + 5 \sin^2x \)

Hmm, that's a sixth-degree polynomial in \( \sinx \). Maybe not

---------------

 so helpful for finding extrema.

Alternatively, perhaps consider the function \( f(x) \) over the interval \( [0, \pi) \), and compute

---------------

 its derivative to find critical points. Let me try that.

Let me compute \( f'(x) \):

\( f(x) = \sin5x \sinx \)

Using

---------------

 product rule:

\( f'(x) = 5\cos5x \sinx + \sin5x \cosx \)

Hmm, that

---------------

's a bit complex. Let me see if I can simplify this expression.

Alternatively, maybe factor or use trigonometric identities on

---------------

 the derivative.

Alternatively, set the derivative equal to zero to find critical points:

\( 5\cos5x \sinx + \sin5x \cosx = 0 \)

Hmm, let me see if this can be written as a single sine or cosine function. Let me note

---------------

 that \( \sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B \). Wait

---------------

, but the terms here are 5cos5x sinx + sin5x cosx. Hmm, not exactly a standard identity.

Alternatively, let me factor terms:

Let

---------------

 me see, 5cos5x sinx + sin5x cosx =0

Hmm, perhaps factor out something

---------------

? Not obvious. Alternatively, express in terms of sum formulas.

Alternatively, let me write the equation as:

5 cos5x sinx = - sin5x cosx

Divide both sides by cosx cos5x, assuming cosx and cos5x are not zero:

5 tanx = - tan5x

Hmm, but

---------------

 not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe use tan5x in terms of tanx?

Alternatively, perhaps use substitution. Let me set \( t = x \), so the

---------------

 equation is:

5 cos5t sin t + sin5t cos t = 0

Hmm, let me see if I can write this as a multiple-angle identity.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 write sin5t cos t as (sin6t + sin4t)/2, using the identity sin A cos B = [sin(A+B) + sin(A-B)]/2. Similarly, 5 cos5t sin t = 5*(sin6t - sin4t)/2.

Let me try that:

First term: 5 cos5x sinx = (5/2)[ sin(5x + x) - sin(5x - x) ] = (5/2)[ sin6x - sin4x ]

Second term: sin5x cosx = (1/2)[ sin(5x + x) + sin(5x - x) ] = (1/2)[ sin6x + sin4x ]

Therefore, the derivative f

---------------

’(x):

= (5/2)(sin6x - sin4x) + (1/2)(sin6x + sin4x)

Combine terms:

= [ (5/2 + 1/2) sin6x ] + [ (-5/2 sin4x + 1/2 sin4x) ]

= (3 sin6x) + (-2 sin4x)

Thus, f’(x) = 3 sin6x - 2 sin4x

Hmm, so setting

---------------

 f’(x)=0 gives 3 sin6x - 2 sin4x =0.

Hmm, that seems manageable. Let me write that equation:

3 sin6x = 2 sin4x

Let me see if I can express sin6x in terms of sin4x. Let

---------------

 me recall that sin6x can be written as sin(4x + 2x) = sin4x cos2x + cos4x sin2x. Maybe

---------------

 that helps?

Alternatively, let me use multiple-angle identities.

Alternatively, let me express sin6x as 2 sin3x cos3x, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 express both sin6x and sin4x in terms of sin2x?

Alternatively, let me set θ = 2x, so that 6x = 3θ and 4x = 2θ. Then the equation becomes:

3 sin3θ - 2 sin2θ = 0

So, 3 sin3θ = 2 sin2θ

Express sin3θ and sin2θ in terms of sinθ and cosθ:

sin3θ = 3 sinθ - 4 sin^3θ

sin2θ = 2 sinθ cosθ

Therefore substituting:

3 (3 sinθ - 4 sin^3θ) = 2 (2 sinθ cosθ)

S

---------------

implify left side: 9 sinθ - 12 sin^3θ

Right side: 4 sinθ cosθ

Bring all terms to left:

9 sinθ - 12 sin^3θ -4 sinθ cosθ = 0

Hmm, factor

---------------

 sinθ:

sinθ (9 - 12 sin²θ -4 cosθ ) =0

So, either sinθ =0, or the other factor is zero.

Case 1: sinθ =0 ⇒

---------------

 θ =0, π, 2π, etc. But θ =2x, and x ∈ [0, π), so θ ∈ [0, 2π). Thus θ=0, π, 2π. But 2π would correspond to x=π, but x is in [0, π), so θ=0, π.

Thus, solutions

---------------

 from sinθ=0: θ=0, π ⇒ x=0, π/2.

Case 2: 9 - 12 sin²θ -4 cosθ =0

Hmm, this

---------------

 equation is a bit more complicated. Let me see if I can rewrite it in terms of cosθ.

We know that sin²θ =1 - cos²θ, so substitute:

9 -12(1 - cos²θ) -4 cosθ =0

Expand:

9 -12 +12 cos²θ -4 cosθ =0

Simplify:

-3 +12 cos²θ -4 cosθ =0

Multiply both sides by -1:

3 -12 cos²θ +4 cosθ =0

Rearranged:

-12 cos²θ +4 cosθ +3 =0

Multiply by -1 again to make it more

---------------

 standard:

12 cos²θ -4 cosθ -3 =0

This is a quadratic equation in cosθ. Let me denote y = cosθ:

12y² -4y -3 =0

Solving for y:

y = [4 ± sqrt(16 + 144)] / (24)

Because discriminant D = 16 + 4*12*3 =16+144=160

Wait, discrimin

---------------

ant D = b² -4ac = (-4)^2 -4*12*(-3)=16 +144=160

Thus,

y = [4 ± sqrt(160)] /24

sqrt(160)=4*sqrt(10), so:

y= [4 ±4√10]/24 = [1 ±√10]/6

Hmm

---------------

, so:

cosθ = [1 +√10]/6 or [1 -√10]/6

Wait, compute numerical values:

First solution: [1 +√10]/6 ≈ [1 +3.1623]/6 ≈4.1623/6≈0.6937

Second solution: [1 -√10]/6≈ [1 -3.1623]/6≈-2.1623/6≈-0.3604

So, cosθ must be between -1 and 1, which both are,

---------------

 so valid.

Therefore, θ= arccos([1 ±√10]/6 )

But θ is in [0, 2π). So we

---------------

 need to find all θ in [0,2π) such that cosθ equals those values. Then, from θ, we can get x =

---------------

θ/2, so x ∈ [0, π).

So, let's compute the possible θ values:

For cosθ = [1 +√10]/6 ≈0.6937,

---------------

 the solutions are θ1 = arccos(0.6937), and θ2 = 2π - arccos(0.6937).

Similarly, for cosθ = [1 -√10]/6≈-0.3604, the solutions are θ3 = arccos(-0.3604), and θ4 = 2π - arccos(-0.3604).

Therefore

---------------

, total possible θ solutions from Case 2 are four angles, but we need to check if they are within [0,2π). Since

---------------

 arccos gives principal values between 0 and π, the other solutions would be in the second revolution?

Wait, no. For

---------------

 the first case, cosθ ≈0.6937, so arccos gives an angle in first quadrant, and the other solution is in the fourth quadrant (since cosine is positive there). So θ1 ≈ arccos(0.6937) ≈46 degrees (approx 0.8 radians?), and θ2 ≈ 2π - θ1 ≈5.48 radians (approx

---------------

 314 degrees). But since θ is in [0, 2π), both are valid.

Similarly, cosθ≈-0.3604, so arccos(-0.3604) is in the second quadrant, say

---------------

 θ3≈111 degrees (≈1.94 radians), and θ4=2π - θ3≈4.34 radians (≈249 degrees). So

---------------

 all four angles are within [0,2π).

Therefore, the critical points for θ (i.e., 2x) are:

From Case 1: θ=0, π (

---------------

so x=0, π/2)

From Case 2: θ1≈0.8 rad, θ2≈5.48 rad, θ3≈1.94 rad, θ4≈4.34 rad.

---------------

 So these correspond to x values:

x1=θ1/2≈0.4 rad, x2=θ2/2≈2.74 rad (but since θ2≈5.48 rad, which

---------------

 is more than π (≈3.14), so 5.48/2≈2.74 rad which is less than π (

---------------

≈3.14), so that's okay.

Wait, 2.74 is less than π≈3.14, so okay

---------------

. Similarly, θ3≈1.94 rad ⇒ x≈0.97 rad, and θ4≈4.34 rad ⇒ x≈2.17 rad.

Therefore, all

---------------

 these critical points are within [0, π).

Therefore, in total, the critical points of f(x) are at x=0, π/2, and the four x

---------------

-values from Case 2. Wait, but how many total critical points?

From Case1: x=0 and x=π/2 (two

---------------

 points)

From Case2: four θ values, so four x-values (since each θ corresponds to one x). So total of 6 critical points? Wait, but perhaps

---------------

 some of them coincide?

Wait, let's see. The θ values from Case2 are distinct, so their x's are also distinct. So total critical points are 2 +4=6 points

---------------

. Hmm, but let me confirm.

Alternatively, maybe some of the θ's from Case2 lead to the same x? Probably

---------------

 not, since each θ is unique. So 6 critical points in total. Hmm.

Therefore, the function f(x)=sin5x sinx has 6 critical points in [0, π). Therefore

---------------

, the function has several local maxima and minima. To find the values of a where the equation has only one solution, we need to look

---------------

 at the extrema. The equation f(x)=a will have a unique solution when a is equal to the maximum or minimum value,

---------------

 but only if that extremum is achieved only once. Wait, actually, even if the extremum is achieved at two different points, but maybe

---------------

 when a is at a certain extremum that is a single point?

Wait, actually, for the equation f(x)=a to have exactly one solution, a

---------------

 must be such that the horizontal line y=a touches the graph of f(x) at exactly one point. That can happen in two cases:

1. When a is equal to the maximum value of f(x) and

---------------

 that maximum is achieved at only one point.

2. Similarly, when a is equal to the minimum value of f(x) and that minimum is achieved at only one point.

Alternatively, if

---------------

 the function has a unique extremum (either maximum or minimum) which is an extremum, but since we have multiple critical points, probably

---------------

 the function has multiple maxima and minima. Therefore, the only possible unique solutions would occur at the very highest maximum or the very lowest minimum, provided that those extrema are achieved only once. Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps at points where the function crosses a certain a exactly once between critical points?

Alternatively, maybe the function f(x) reaches

---------------

 a certain a only once in the interval when the horizontal line is tangent to the graph at one point (i.e., a double root), but that

---------------

 would be a case where the equation has a double root, but since we need a unique solution, that would count as one solution (with multiplicity two, but since

---------------

 we're talking about real solutions in the interval, multiplicity might not matter here; the question says "unique solution", so maybe counting

---------------

 distinct solutions). Hmm, perhaps need to be careful here.

Alternatively, perhaps the function f(x) has certain peaks and valleys where only

---------------

 at the very top or bottom, the horizontal line touches only once. Let me try to sketch or analyze the function.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 compute f(x) at critical points and endpoints to find the maxima and minima.

Wait, endpoints: the interval is [0, π). So endpoints

---------------

 are x=0 and approaching π (but not including π). Let me compute f(0) and f(π-

---------------

).

At x=0: f(0)=sin0 * sin0=0.

At x approaching π: Let me compute the limit as x approaches π from below.

sin5x sin

---------------

x: as x→π, sinx approaches sinπ=0, sin5x approaches sin5π=0. So the

---------------

 product approaches 0. So f(π-) =0.

So the endpoints both approach 0.

Now, to find the maxima and minima, we need to compute f(x) at the critical points.

Let

---------------

 me list all critical points:

From Case1:

x1=0 (endpoint, already considered),

x2=π/2 �

---------------

�1.5708.

From Case2:

Let me denote the four critical points from Case2 as:

x3≈0.4 rad,

x4≈0.97 rad,

x5≈2.17 rad,

x6≈2.74 rad.

Wait, actually

---------------

, the four x from Case2 are:

From θ1≈0.8 rad ⇒ x≈0.4 rad,

θ3≈1.94 rad ⇒ x≈0.97 rad,

θ4≈4.34 rad ⇒ x≈2.17 rad,

θ2≈5.48 rad ⇒ x≈2.74 rad.

Wait, so

---------------

 the four critical points from Case2 are at approximately 0.4, 0.97, 2.17, and 2.74 radians.

So total

---------------

 critical points (excluding endpoints) are x=π/2 and the four from Case2. So total of five critical points inside

---------------

 the interval? Wait, no, including endpoints, but endpoints are already considered as critical points via the derivative.

Wait, actually, the

---------------

 derivative at x=0: let me check, but perhaps f(x) is differentiable at all points except maybe endpoints, but since we are

---------------

 considering the interval [0, π), the critical points are where derivative is zero, so x=0 is a critical point as

---------------

 well? Hmm, but at x=0, the derivative might not exist or is zero?

Wait, let me compute the derivative at x=0. The function f(x)=sin5x sinx. The derivative at x=0:

Using the derivative expression f’(x)=3 sin6x -2 sin4x,

At x=0, sin0=0, so f’(0)=0. So yes, x=0 is a critical point.

Similarly, at x=π/2, let's compute f’(π/2):

sin6*(π/2)=sin3π=0,

sin4*(π/2)=sin2π=0,

so f’(π/2)=0 -

---------------

0=0. So that's a critical point as well.

Therefore, the critical points are indeed at the endpoints and the four from

---------------

 case2.

Therefore, to find the maxima and minima, let's evaluate f(x) at all critical points.

First, at

---------------

 x=0: f(0)=0.

At x=π/2: compute f(π/2):

sin5*(π/2) * sin(π/2).

sin(5π/2)=sin(π/2 + 2π)=sin(π/2)=1,

sin(π/2)=1,

so f(π/2)=1*1=1.

Hmm, so f(π/2)=1.

At x approaching π: f approaches 0.

Now, let's compute f at the other critical points.

First, let

---------------

's compute f at x3≈0.4 rad:

Compute f(0.4)=sin(5*0.4)*sin(0.4)=sin(2)*sin(0.4)

sin(2 radians)≈0.9093,

sin(0.4)≈0.3894,

so product

---------------

≈0.9093*0.3894≈0.354.

Hmm, so approximately

---------------

 0.354.

Wait, but maybe better to compute more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of approximating, I

---------------

 can find exact values?

Alternatively, maybe we can compute the exact value for these critical points.

Alternatively, since this might take too long, perhaps proceed with approximate values.

Next

---------------

, x4≈0.97 rad (which is θ3/2≈1.94/2≈0.97):

Compute f(0.97)=sin(5*0.97)*sin(0.97).

5*0.97≈4.85 rad,

sin(4.85)=

---------------

sin(4.85 - π) since π≈3.14,

so 4.85-3.14≈1.71 rad,

sin(1.71)≈0.988,

Wait

---------------

, sin(4.85)=sin(π + 1.71)= -sin(1.71)≈-0.988,

Wait

---------------

, but let me compute directly:

sin(4.85):

4.85 radians is in the third quadrant (π to 3π/2?),

---------------

 since π≈3.14, so 4.85 is between π and 3π/2≈4.712. Wait, 4.85 is slightly

---------------

 above 3π/2≈4.712. So it's in the fourth quadrant? Wait, no, 3π/2 is 4.712, so 4.85 is just

---------------

 past that, so actually in the fourth quadrant? Wait, no:

Wait, π is ~3.14, 3π/2 ~4.712, 2π~6.28. So 4.85 is between 3π/2 and 2π? Wait, 3π/2 is ~4.712, so 4.85 is just

---------------

 past 3π/2, so in the fourth quadrant. In the fourth quadrant, sine is negative.

Therefore sin(4.85)=sin(π + (4.85 - π))=sin(π +1.71)= -sin(1.71). Wait, but maybe

---------------

 better to compute numerically:

sin(4.85):

Using calculator input:

sin(4.85) ≈ sin(4.85) ≈ sin

---------------

(4.85 - 2π) ?

Wait, 4.85 radians is less than 2π (~

---------------

6.28), so directly compute:

sin(4.85) ≈ sin(4.85) ≈ let

---------------

 me use calculator:

sin(4.85):

Well, 4.85 radians is 4.85*(180/π)≈277.8 degrees.

sin(277.8 degrees)=sin(360-82.2)= -sin(82.2)≈-0.990.

Thus

---------------

 sin(4.85)≈-0.990.

Then sin(0.97)≈sin(0.97)≈0.824.

Thus f(x4)= sin(4.85)*sin(0.97)≈(-0.990)(0.824)≈-0.816.

Hmm, so approximately

---------------

 -0.816.

Wait, but let me check again:

Wait, sin(5x) when x=0.97 is

---------------

 5*0.97≈4.85 rad. So sin(4.85)≈-0.990,

sinx=

---------------

 sin(0.97)≈0.824,

so product≈-0.990*0.824≈-0.816.

Okay, so that's about

---------------

 -0.816.

Next, x5≈2.17 rad (θ4≈4.34 rad, so x≈2.17):

Compute f(2.17)=sin(5*2.17)*sin(2.17).

5*2.17≈10.85 rad,

sin(10.85)=

---------------

sin(10.85 - 3*2π)= since 3*2π≈18.84, so 10.85 is less than that. Alternatively, subtract 2π once

---------------

: 10.85 - 6.28≈4.57 rad,

sin(4.57). 4.57 rad is between

---------------

 π (~3.14) and 3π/2 (~4.712). So in third quadrant.

sin(4.57)=sin(π + 1.43)= -sin(1.43)≈-0.989.

sin

---------------

(2.17)=sin(2.17). 2.17 rad is about 124 degrees (since π≈3.14, so 2.17 is approx

---------------

 124 degrees), so sin(2.17)≈0.808.

Thus, sin(10.85)*sin(2.17)≈(-0.989)(0.808)≈-0.800.

Hmm, so approx -0.8.

Wait, but let

---------------

 me check with calculator-like steps:

Alternatively, 5x=5*2.17=10.85 radians

---------------

,

10.85 - 3*2π=10.85 - 18.84≈-7.99 rad. Not helpful. Let's compute

---------------

 sin(10.85):

10.85 radians is equivalent to 10.85 - 3*2π?

---------------

 Wait, 2π≈6.28, so 10.85-6.28≈4.57 rad,

---------------

 which is as above.

sin(4.57)=sin(π + (4.57 - π))=sin(π +1.43)= -sin(1.43). 

---------------

1.43 rad≈82 degrees, so sin(1.43)≈0.989. So sin(4.57)= -0.989.

Similarly

---------------

, sin(2.17)=sin(2.17). 2.17 is approx 124 degrees, sin(124°)=sin(56°)=0

---------------

.829? Wait, sin(124)=sin(180-56)=sin56≈0.829. Hmm, so 

---------------

0.829.

Thus, the product would be -0.989 * 0.829 ≈-0.821.

Hmm, so maybe

---------------

 approximately -0.82.

Wait, so x5≈2.17 gives f(x)≈-0.82.

Now

---------------

, x6≈2.74 rad (θ2≈5.48 rad, so x≈2.74):

Compute f(2.74)=sin(5*2.74)*sin(2.74).

5*2.74≈13.7 rad,

sin(13.7)=

---------------

sin(13.7 - 2*2π)=13.7 -12.566≈1.134 rad,

so sin(1.134)≈0.904.

Wait, but let me do

---------------

 it step by step:

13.7 radians: subtract 2π (6.28) gives 13.7-6.28≈7.42 rad,

again

---------------

 subtract 2π: 7.42-6.28≈1.14 rad,

so sin(13.7)=sin(1.14)≈0.906.

Wait, but actually

---------------

, sin(13.7)=sin(13.7 - 4π) since 4π≈12.566,

13.7 -12.566≈1.134 rad,

so sin(1.134)≈0.904.

sin(2.74)=sin(2.74). 2.74 rad is about 156 degrees (since π≈3.14, so 2.74 is 

---------------

156 degrees). sin(156°)=sin(24°)=≈0.4067.

Wait, but

---------------

 156 degrees is 180-24, so sin(156)=sin(24)=≈0.4067.

Thus, f(x6)=sin(13.7)*sin(2.74)≈0.904 *0.4067≈0.367.

Hmm, so approximately 0.367.

Wait, let me check again

---------------

:

sin(5x)=sin(13.7)=sin(1.134)≈sin(1.134)≈sin(65 degrees?)

---------------

 Wait, 1.134 rad is about 65 degrees (since π/3≈1.047 is 60 degrees, so 1.134 is ~65 degrees). So sin(65°)=≈0.906.

sin(2.74 radians)=sin(156 degrees)=sin(24 degrees)=≈0.4067.

Thus, the product is �

---------------

�0.906*0.4067≈0.368.

So approximately 0.37.

So summarizing:

Critical points and their f(x) values:

1. x=0: f=0

2. x≈0.4 rad: f≈0.354

3. x≈0.97 rad: f≈-0.816

4. x=π/2≈1.5708 rad: f=1

5. x≈2.17 rad: f≈-0.82

6. x≈2.74 rad: f≈0.367

7. x approaching π: f approaches 0.

Wait, but actually

---------------

, the critical points are 0, π/2, and the four from Case2 (so total of 6 critical points). The

---------------

 above list includes all six.

So, compiling the approximate f(x) values at critical points:

- At x=0: 0

- x≈0.4 rad: ~0.354

- x≈0.97 rad: ~-0.816

- x=π/2 (~1.5708 rad): 1

- x≈2.17 rad: ~-0.82

- x≈2.74 rad: ~0.367

-

---------------

 At x approaching π: 0

So, from this, the maximum value of f(x) in the interval is 1 (at x=π/2), and the minimum values are approximately -0.82 at both x≈0.97 rad and x≈2.17 rad. The

---------------

 other critical points (0.4 and 2.74 rad) give f≈0.35 and 0.37, which are local maxima or

---------------

 minima?

Wait, let me see:

Looking at the values:

From 0 to π/2 (~1.57):

At x=0, f=0,

then at

---------------

 0.4 rad (~23 degrees), f≈0.354,

then at 0.97 rad (~55 degrees), f≈-0.816,

then at π/2 (~90 degrees), f=1.

Hmm, so between 0 and π/2, the function goes up to ~0.35, then down to -0.8, then up to 1?

Wait, that seems inconsistent. Wait, perhaps my approximations are off?



---------------

Wait, let me think again.

Wait, at x=0.4 rad (~23 degrees):

sin5x =

---------------

 sin(2 rad)≈0.909,

sinx≈sin0.4≈0.389,

so their product is ~0.354.

At x=0.97 rad (~55.6 degrees):

sin5x =

---------------

 sin(4.85 rad)=sin(π + 1.71)≈-sin(1.71)≈-0.988,

sinx≈sin0.97≈0.824,

so product≈-0.816.

At

---------------

 x=π/2 (~1.57 rad):

sin5*(π/2)=sin(5π/2)=sin(π/2 + 2π)=sin(π/2)=1,

sin(π/2)=1,

so product=1.

So from x=0 to π/2, the function goes from 0 up to ~0.35, then down to ~-0.8, then up to 1? Wait, that would

---------------

 require a local maximum at x≈0.4, then a local minimum at x≈0.97, then up

---------------

 to π/2.

Wait, that might be possible. Let me see the graph.

Alternatively, perhaps between 0 and π/2, the function first

---------------

 increases to 0.35, then decreases to -0.8, then increases to 1? That seems possible if

---------------

 there's a local maximum at 0.4 and a local minimum at 0.97.

Then, from π/2 to π:

At π/2, f=1,

then at x≈2.17 rad (~124 degrees):

f≈-0.82,

then at x≈2.74 rad (~157 degrees):

f≈0.37,

and approaching π, f→0.

So from π/2 to π, the function goes from 1 down to -0.82, then up to 0.37, then down to 0.

Therefore, the function

---------------

 has several peaks and valleys.

So the maximum value is indeed 1 at x=π/2, and the minimum value is approximately -0.82, achieved at two points: x≈0.97 rad and x≈2.17 rad.

Therefore

---------------

, the function f(x) reaches 1 only once (at π/2), reaches the minimum of ~-0.82 at two points, and has other local maxima and minima.

Therefore, to have the equation f(x)=a has exactly one solution in [0, π), the value a must be either:

1. The maximum value 1, because that is achieved only once (at π/2).

2. The value of

---------------

 f at some extremum which is achieved only once, but looking at the critical points, all other extrema (the local maxima and minima) are achieved at two points except for the global maximum.



---------------

Wait, the local maxima at x≈0.4 and x≈2.74 are both around ~0.35-0.37, so those

---------------

 might be the same value? Wait, in my approximate calculations, x=0.4 had ~0.354 and x=2.74 had ~0.367, which are close but not exactly the same. Maybe

---------------

 they are actually equal?

Wait, let's check with exact expressions.

Wait, perhaps the function is symmetric in some way?

Wait

---------------

, note that f(x) = sin5x sinx.

Let me check f(π - x):

f(π - x) = sin5(π -x) sin(π -x) = sin(5π -5x) sin(π -x)

sin(5π -5x) = sin(π -5x) because sin(5π -5x)=sin(π -5x +4π)=sin(π -5x),

and sin(π -x)=sinx.

Therefore, sin(5π -5x)=sin(π -5x)=sin5x cos

---------------

π - cos5x sinπ= -sin5x.

Wait, wait:

Wait, sin(5π -5x)=sin(5π)cos5x - cos5π sin5x,



---------------

sin5π=0, cos5π=cosπ= -1,

so sin(5π -5x)=0*cos5x - (-1) sin5x= sin5x.

Wait, that

---------------

 contradicts the previous thought.

Wait, actually, sin(5π -5x)=sin(π*(5) -5x)=sin(5π -5x)=sin(π*(5) -5x).

But since sin has a period of 2π, so sin(5π -5x)=sin(π -5x +4π)=sin(π -5x).

Thus

---------------

 sin(π -5x)=sin5x cosπ - cos5x sinπ= -sin5x.

Wait, that

---------------

 would be:

sin(π -5x)=sinπ cos5x - cosπ sin5x=0*(-cos5x) - (-1)sin5x= sin5x.

Wait, no

---------------

, actually:

Wait, sin(A - B) = sinA cosB - cosA sinB,

so sin(π -5x)=sinπ cos5x - cosπ sin5x = 0*cos5x - (-1) sin5x = sin5x.

Ah

---------------

, right, so sin(π -5x)=sin5x.

Therefore, f(π -x)= sin(5(π -x)) sin(π -x) = sin(5π -5x) sin(π -x)= sin5x * sinx = f(x).

Thus, the function f(x) is symmetric about x=π/2. So f(π -x)=f(x).

Therefore, the graph of f(x) is symmetric around the line x=π/2.

Therefore, the critical points come

---------------

 in pairs symmetric around π/2. For instance, the critical point at x≈0.4 rad corresponds to π -0.4≈2.74 rad, which is exactly

---------------

 the x≈2.74 rad point. Similarly, the critical point at x≈0.97 rad corresponds to π -0.97≈2.17 rad, which is the other critical point at

---------------

 ~2.17 rad. The critical point at π/2 is the center.

Therefore, the function's maximum at π/2 is unique, while all other extrema (local maxima and minima) occur in pairs symmetric around π/2.

Therefore, the minimum

---------------

 value of f(x) is achieved at two points (x≈0.97 and x≈2.17), and the local maxima at ~0.4 and ~2.74 are equal in

---------------

 value (due to symmetry), so those are also paired.

Therefore, the only extremum that is achieved at a single point is the global maximum at x=π/2.

---------------

 The global minimum is achieved at two points.

Therefore, the equation f(x)=a will have a unique solution only when a=1 (the global maximum) or when a is such that the horizontal line y=a intersects the graph at exactly one point elsewhere

---------------

. Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps there are other points where the function is monotonic? For example, between certain critical points, the function might cross a certain a only once. But

---------------

 since the function is symmetric, maybe at some a between the local maxima and the global maximum, or between the local minima and the global minimum, there are

---------------

 two solutions, but at the exact extrema?

Wait, actually, the only a for which the equation has exactly one solution is when a=1 (the global maximum).

---------------

 Because at any other a, the horizontal line would intersect the graph either twice (for a between the local maxima and the global maximum, or between the local minima and the global minimum), or four times (for a between the local maxima and minima), except at

---------------

 the extrema. However, the global minimum is achieved at two points, so when a equals the global minimum, the equation would have two solutions, so that's not unique. The

---------------

 only unique solution is when a is the global maximum, which is achieved only once.

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose

---------------

 a is slightly less than 1, then the equation would have two solutions near π/2, but since it's a maximum, actually

---------------

, near the peak, maybe only one solution? Wait, no. If the function reaches 1 at x=π/2, then just below 1, there would be two points near π/2 where f(x)=a, symmetric around π/2. But because of the symmetry, except

---------------

 exactly at the maximum.

Wait, actually, when a is exactly equal to the global maximum (1), the equation f(x)=a has only one solution (x=π/2). For any a less than 1, there would be two solutions near π/2 (

---------------

but actually, given the symmetry, two points symmetric around π/2). Wait, but since the function is symmetric about π/2, for

---------------

 any a less than 1, there are two solutions near π/2? Wait, let me think.

Wait, let

---------------

 me consider the graph. The function reaches maximum at π/2. To the left and right of π/2, the function decreases. So if you take a value just below 1, the equation f(x)=a would have two solutions: one slightly to the left of π/2 and another slightly to the right. But

---------------

 since the domain is [0, π), the right side of π/2 would go up to π. But due to the symmetry, the two solutions would be symmetric with respect to π/2. For

---------------

 example, if one solution is π/2 - ε, the other would be π/2 + ε. Since π/2 + ε is still less than π as long as ε < π/2. So yes, two solutions. Therefore, only at a=1 does it have one solution.

Similarly, for the minimum value,

---------------

 which is approximately -0.82, achieved at two points, so setting a=-0.82 would give two solutions, so that's not unique.

However, maybe

---------------

 there are other points where the function's value is achieved only once?

Wait, the function is 0 at the endpoints x=0 and x approaching π. So if

---------------

 a=0, the equation f(x)=0 would have solutions at x=0, approaching π, and possibly other points where sin5x sinx=0.

Wait

---------------

, sin5x sinx=0 when either sinx=0 or sin5x=0.

sinx=0 ⇒ x=0, π.

sin5x=0 ⇒5x=kπ ⇒x=kπ/5, for integer k.

Within [0, π), x=0, π/5, 2π/5, 3π/5, 4π/5, π.

Thus, the solutions to f(x)=0 are x=0, π/5, 2π/5, 3π/5, 4π/5, and approaching π.

Therefore, when

---------------

 a=0, there are six solutions? Wait, but x=π is not included. So at x=π, the function approaches zero, but π

---------------

 is excluded. So the solutions are x=0, π/5, 2π/5, 3π/5, 4π/5. That's five solutions. Hmm

---------------

, so a=0 would give five solutions, which is more than one.

Therefore, a=0 is not a candidate.

Therefore

---------------

, the only value of a for which there is exactly one solution is a=1.

Wait, but let me check if

---------------

 there are any other points where the function might touch a horizontal line only once.

For example, maybe at the local maxima or

---------------

 minima? The local maxima at ~0.35 and ~0.37 (but they are symmetric, so same value?),

---------------

 so if a is equal to that local maximum, then the equation would have two solutions (the two symmetric points). Similarly for the local minima.

Wait

---------------

, but what about the points between the local maxima and minima? For example, between x=0.97 and x=2.17, the

---------------

 function reaches down to the minimum and then up again? Wait, but according to the critical points, after the minimum at x≈2.17, it goes up to ~0.37 at x≈2.74.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 there are some a values where the horizontal line intersects only once in a certain interval?

Alternatively, perhaps when a is greater than the local maxima but less than the global maximum, but

---------------

 then there would still be two solutions near the peak.

Alternatively, maybe when a is equal to one of the local maxima or minima but only

---------------

 at one point? But they are achieved at two points due to symmetry.

Hmm, so perhaps the only possible a with a unique solution is a=1.

Wait, but wait another thought: the

---------------

 problem says "in the interval [0, π)", so x=0 is included but x=π is not. The

---------------

 function is 0 at x=0 and approaches 0 as x approaches π. So between x=0 and π, the function goes

---------------

 from 0 up to 1, then back down to 0. But with the oscillations in between.

Wait, but given

---------------

 the symmetry, perhaps the only unique solution is when a=1. Let me confirm with an example.

Suppose a=1. The only solution is x=π/2. Correct.

Suppose a=0.5

---------------

. Then there would be two solutions near π/2 (one on each side), two solutions near the local maxima, and so

---------------

 on? Wait, but depending on the exact value.

Alternatively, maybe there's another case where the horizontal line is tangent to the function at a point which is an extremum,

---------------

 but not the global one. For instance, if there is a point where the function has a horizontal tangent (critical point) and that is also the only point where f(x)=a, but since all

---------------

 other critical points are extrema achieved at two points, that can't happen.

Alternatively, maybe the endpoints? At x=0 and approaching π, f(x)=0. So if a=0, as

---------------

 before, but that has multiple solutions.

Therefore, after analyzing, I think the only value of a for which the equation has exactly one solution is a=1.

Wait, but hold

---------------

 on, let me check the function's behavior near the endpoints.

Wait, for a=0, there are multiple solutions. For a=1, only one solution. For a between

---------------

 the local maxima (~0.37) and 1, two solutions near the peak. For a between the local minima (~-0.82) and local maxima, there

---------------

 might be four solutions? Hmm.

Wait, let me consider an a between, say, 0.5 and 1. Then the horizontal line would intersect the graph twice near the peak (left

---------------

 and right of π/2), and maybe also intersect the ascending and descending parts from the local minima? Wait, no

---------------

, since between the local maxima and the global maximum, the function only reaches up to 1, so between the local maxima (~0.37) and 1, the intersections would be two points near the peak. The

---------------

 other parts of the graph are lower.

Wait, perhaps plotting the graph would help, but since I can't do that here, let me think numer

---------------

ically.

Suppose a=0.5. Then:

Looking at the critical points:

Between x=0 and π/2, the function goes from 0 to ~0.35 at 0.4 rad, then down to ~-0.816 at 0.97 rad, then up to 1 at π/2. So between 0 and π/2, the function reaches 0.35, then goes down to -0.8, then up again. Therefore, to

---------------

 reach a=0.5, which is between 0.35 and 1, there would be two points: one between 0.4 rad and π/2 (ascending to 1), and another between 0 and 0.4 rad? Wait, no, because from 0 to 0.4, the function goes from 0 to 0.35, so it never reaches 0.5 there. From

---------------

 0.4 to π/2, it goes from 0.35 down to -0.8 and back up to 1. Wait, that

---------------

 seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps my previous analysis was incorrect. Let me retrace.

Wait, at x=0.4 rad (~23 degrees):

f(x)=~0.354,

then at x=0.97 rad (~55 degrees), it's ~-0.816,

then at π/2 (~90 degrees), it's 1.

Wait, so from x=0.4 to π/2, the function goes from 0.35 down to -0.816 and then back up to 1?

That would mean that

---------------

 between 0.4 and π/2, the function first decreases to -0.816 at 0.97 rad, then increases to 1 at π/2.

Therefore, the

---------------

 function between 0.4 and π/2 has a local minimum at 0.97 rad, then rises.

Therefore, for a=0.5, the horizontal line would cross the graph:

- Once between 0.4 and 0.97 rad (since

---------------

 going from 0.35 down to -0.8, it must cross 0.5 once on the way down? Wait, no, going from 0.35 to -0.816, it would

---------------

 cross 0.5 downwards, but 0.5 is above 0.35? Wait, 0.5 is higher than 0.35, so actually, after

---------------

 x=0.4, the function decreases below 0.35, so it never reaches 0.5 again in that interval. Wait, this

---------------

 is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I need to think of the function's path:

From x=0 to x=0.4 rad: increasing

---------------

 to ~0.35,

then from x=0.4 to x≈0.97 rad: decreasing to -0.816,

then from x=0.97 rad to π/2: increasing to 1.

Therefore, between 0 and π/2, the function reaches a local maximum at x=0.4, then a local minimum at x≈0.97, then rises

---------------

 to the global maximum at π/2.

Therefore, the portion from x=0.4 to π/2 has a minimum

---------------

 at 0.97 and then increases to 1. So between x=0.97 and π/2, the function goes from -0.816 to 1. So for

---------------

 a=0.5, which is between -0.816 and 1, there would be two crossings in that interval: one between 0.97 and π/2 (rising from -0.8 to 1), and another crossing

---------------

 between π/2 and where?

Wait, no, after π/2, the function goes down again?

Wait, after π/2, up

---------------

 to π, let's see:

At π/2 (~1.57), f=1,

then at x≈2.17 rad (~124 degrees), f≈-0.82,

then at x≈2.74 rad (~157 degrees), f≈0.37,

then approaching π (~3.14), f approaches 0.

So from π/2 to π, the function decreases from 1 to -0.82 at 2.17 rad, then increases to 0.37 at 2.74 rad, then decreases to 0.

Therefore, between π/2 and π, the function has a local minimum at x≈2.17 rad and a local maximum at x≈2.74 rad.

Thus, for a=0.5, the horizontal line would intersect:

- Between x=0 and x=0.4 rad: once

---------------

 (rising from 0 to 0.35, but 0.5 is higher, so no),

- Between x=0.4 and x=0.97 rad: decreasing from 0.35 to -0.816: crosses 0.5 once on

---------------

 the way down? Wait, 0.5 is above 0.35, so actually, the function never reaches 0.5 in that interval,



---------------

Wait, from 0.4 to 0.97 rad, it goes from 0.35 to -0.816, so it crosses

---------------

 0.5 downwards? No, it's going below 0.35, so it doesn't reach 0.5 again there.

Then between x=0.97 rad and π/2 (~1.57), the function goes from -0.816 to 1. So it crosses 0.5 once on the way up.

Between π/2 and 2.17 rad (~2.17), it goes from 1 down to -0.82, so crosses 0.5 once on the way down.

Between 2.17 rad and 2.74 rad (~2.74), it goes from -0.82 to 0.37, so crosses 0.5? No, it

---------------

 goes from -0.82 up to 0.37, which is below 0.5, so doesn't reach 0.5 there.

Between 2.74 rad and π, it goes from 0.37 down to 0, so doesn

---------------

't reach 0.5.

Therefore, total crossings for a=0.5 would be two: one between 0.97 and π/2, and another between π/2 and 2.17 rad. So two solutions.

Similarly, for a between the local maximum (0.37) and the global maximum (1), there would be two solutions near the peak (on either side of π/2). For a between the local minimum (-0.82) and the local maximum (0.37), there would be four solutions?

---------------

 Let me see:

Take a=0:

As before, five solutions, but a=0 is a special case.

Take a=-0.5:

Between x=0.97 and π/2: going

---------------

 from -0.816 to 1, crosses -0.5 once,

Between π/2 and 2.17 rad: going from 1 to -0.82, crosses -0.5 once,

Between 2.17 and 2.74 rad: going from -0.82 to 0.37, crosses -0.5 once,

Also

---------------

 between 0 and 0.4 rad: function goes from 0 to 0.35, so doesn't reach -0.5,

Between 2.74 and π: from 0.37 to 0, so no.

Thus total of three crossings? Wait, but

---------------

 at x=0.97 rad (~0.97), which is part of the first interval.

Wait, maybe

---------------

 four crossings? Hmm, need to be precise.

Alternatively, for a between the local minima and local maxima, there

---------------

 are four solutions: two on each side of the central peak.

Therefore, the only a with exactly one solution is a=1.

Wait

---------------

, but let me think if there's another case.

What about the local maxima at ~0.37? If a is exactly equal to that value, then the equation would have two solutions (the symmetric points at ~0.4 and ~2.74). Similarly, if a is equal

---------------

 to the local minimum (~-0.82), two solutions.

Therefore, the only a with exactly one solution is a=1.

Wait

---------------

, but let me confirm with another value, say a=0.9, very close to 1.

Then, the equation f(x)=0.9 would have two solutions near π/2, one slightly left and one slightly right. Since

---------------

 the function reaches 1 at π/2, just below that, it would have two points close to π/2 where

---------------

 f(x)=0.9. So two solutions.

Only when a=1 is there exactly one solution.

Therefore, the answer is a=1.

Wait, but the

---------------

 problem says "values" plural. Maybe I missed something?

Wait, let me check the endpoints again. The function is zero at x=0 and approaches zero at x approaching π. So

---------------

 when a=0, there are multiple solutions (five?), but maybe at the very endpoints?

Wait, the equation is sin

---------------

2x sin4x - sinx sin3x =a. At x=0, all sines are zero, so f(0)=0. At x approaching π, sinx approaches zero, sin2x=sin(2π)=0, sin3x=sin3π=0, sin4x=sin4π=0. So f approaches zero. So the

---------------

 function is zero at both ends but also at other points.

But the problem asks for solutions in [0, π). So, for

---------------

 a=0, the solutions are x=0, π/5, 2π/5, 3π/5, 4π/5, and approaching π (but π is excluded). So exactly

---------------

 five solutions (excluding π). So a=0 is not unique.

Wait, but perhaps there is another maximum or minimum that

---------------

 is achieved only once?

Wait, the function's maximum is only at one point, so a=1 is unique.

Alternatively

---------------

, is there another extremum only at one point?

Wait, due to the symmetry, every extremum except the central one has a pair. So the

---------------

 only unique extremum is the central maximum at x=π/2. Therefore, the only a with a unique solution is a=1.

Wait, but let

---------------

 me check the value at x=0. When x=0, f(x)=0, but there are other points where f(x)=0, so that's not unique.

Therefore

---------------

, the only possible value is a=1.

Wait, but let me check if there is a case where the equation equals a at

---------------

 exactly one point in the interval, other than the maximum.

Wait, suppose a is such that the horizontal line touches the function exactly at one of the local

---------------

 extrema where the function turns around, but due to the symmetry, those are double points?

Hmm, no, since they occur at two points, so even if the line is tangent, it would be tangent at two symmetric points, so

---------------

 still two solutions.

Alternatively, maybe at a certain a, the function only crosses the line once in the entire interval?

Wait, for

---------------

 example, if a is greater than 1, then there are no solutions. If a is less than the minimum (~-0.82), also no solutions.

Between -0.82 and 1, there are solutions. The only a with exactly one solution is 1.

Hence, the answer should be a=1.

Wait, but I

---------------

 need to make sure that there are no other points where the function might have a unique intersection.

Wait, suppose a=0.37, the local maximum. Then, the equation would have two solutions (the two symmetric points at ~0.4 and ~2.74 rad). Similarly, at a= -0.82, two solutions.

Therefore, yes

---------------

, only a=1 gives exactly one solution.

Therefore, the answer is 1.

Wait, but wait, hold on.

---------------

 Let me think again about the symmetry.

The function is symmetric about π/2. Therefore, for any a except the maximum and minima, the solutions come in pairs symmetric around π/2. The

---------------

 maximum is at the center, so it's the only solution for a=1. The minima are two points, so a=-0.82 gives two solutions. The

---------------

 other critical points also come in pairs. Thus, the only a with exactly one solution is a=1.

Therefore, the answer is \boxed{1}

**Final Answer**
Answer: \boxed{1}


To determine the values of the real parameter \( a \) such that the equation 
\[ \sin 2x \sin 4x - \sin x \sin 3x = a \]
has a unique solution in the interval \([0, \pi)\), we start by simplifying the left-hand side using trigonometric identities.

First, we use the product-to-sum identities:
\[
\sin 2x \sin 4x = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 2x - \cos 6x]
\]
\[
\sin x \sin 3x = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 2x - \cos 4x]
\]
Subtracting these, we get:
\[
\sin 2x \sin 4x - \sin x \sin 3x = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 2x - \cos 6x] - \frac{1}{2} [\cos 2x - \cos 4x] = \frac{1}{2} (\cos 4x - \cos 6x)
\]
Using the identity for the difference of cosines:
\[
\cos 4x - \cos 6x = 2 \sin 5x \sin x
\]
Thus, the equation simplifies to:
\[
\sin 5x \sin x = a
\]

Next, we analyze the function \( f(x) = \sin 5x \sin x \) over the interval \([0, \pi)\). We find the critical points by taking the derivative:
\[
f'(x) = 5 \cos 5x \sin x + \sin 5x \cos x
\]
Setting \( f'(x) = 0 \) and solving, we find the critical points. Through analysis, we determine that the function \( f(x) \) has a maximum value of 1 at \( x = \frac{\pi}{2} \) and minimum values of approximately -0.82 at two points \(

---------------

 x \approx 0.97 \) and \( x \approx 2.17 \).

The function is symmetric about \( x = \frac{\pi}{2} \), meaning all local maxima and minima (except the global maximum) are achieved at two symmetric points. The global maximum of 1 at \( x = \frac{\pi}{2} \) is unique.

Thus, the equation \( \sin 5x \sin x = a \) has a unique solution only when \( a = 1 \), as this is the only value achieved by the function at a single point in the interval.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}
