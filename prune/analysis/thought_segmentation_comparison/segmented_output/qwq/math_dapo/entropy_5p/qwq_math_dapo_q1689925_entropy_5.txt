Okay, so here's this problem about Jenny and Kenny walking on parallel paths that are 200 feet apart. They're walking in the same direction, but Kenny is faster:

---------------

 3 feet per second versus Jenny's 1 foot per second. There's also this circular building with a 100-foot diameter right in the middle between their paths. The question says that at the moment when the building first blocks their line of sight, they are 200 feet apart. We need to find the time t until they can see each other again, express it as a reduced fraction, and then add the numerator and denominator.

Hmm, let's start by visualizing the scenario. Both are walking on parallel paths, 200 feet apart. The building is midway, so each path is 100 feet from the center of the building. The building's diameter is 100 feet, so its radius is 50 feet. So the edges of the building are 50 feet from the center, meaning each path is 100 feet from the center, so the distance from each path to the building's edge is 100 - 50 = 50 feet? Wait, no, that

---------------

 can't be. Wait, the building is centered midway between the paths. The paths are 200 feet apart, so midway would be 100 feet from each path. The building has a diameter of 100 feet, so radius 50 feet. So the building extends 50 feet from the center towards each path. Therefore, the distance from each path to the building is 100 - 50 = 50 feet. So each path is 50 feet away from the nearest edge of the building.

Alright

---------------

, so when they first can't see each other, their line of sight is just tangent to the building. The problem states that at that instant, they are 200 feet apart. Wait

---------------

, their distance apart is 200 feet. Since they are on parallel paths, their separation along the direction of travel must be such that the distance between them is 200 feet. Wait, but they

---------------

 are walking in the same direction. So if they are 200 feet apart, that would be along the direction of the paths? Hmm

---------------

, perhaps.

Wait, let me think again. Since they're on parallel paths 200 feet apart, their positions can be considered as two points separated by 200 feet in the perpendicular

---------------

 direction. But their actual distance apart would be the hypotenuse of the distance along the path and the 200 feet. Wait, so

---------------

 if they are moving in the same direction, their separation along the path can vary. Let me try to formalize this.

Let me set up coordinates. Let's say

---------------

 the two paths are along the lines y = 100 and y = -100 (since they are 200 feet apart, so

---------------

 midway is at y=0). The building is a circle centered at the origin (0,0) with radius 50 feet. Wait, diameter

---------------

 100, so radius 50. So the equation of the building is x² + y² = 50². Wait, but the center is at (0,0), so that

---------------

's correct.

Now, Jenny and Kenny are walking along the paths y = 100 and y = -100 respectively, in the same direction, let's say along the positive x-axis. Let me assume that their positions at time t are (x_j(t), 100) and (x_k(t), -100). Since they are moving in the same direction, their x-coordinates are increasing over time. Let

---------------

 me denote their speeds: Jenny at 1 ft/s, so x_j(t) = x_j0 + t, and Kenny at 3 ft/s, so x_k(t) = x_k0 + 3t. Here

---------------

, x_j0 and x_k0 are their initial positions at t=0. 

However, the problem mentions an instant when the building first blocks their line of sight, and at that moment, they are 200 feet apart. Let me denote that instant

---------------

 as t = t0. At that time, the line connecting their positions is tangent to the building. Also, their distance apart is 200 feet. 

Wait, the

---------------

 distance between them at time t is sqrt[(x_j(t) - x_k(t))² + (100 - (-100))²] = sqrt[(x_j(t) - x_k(t))² + (200)^2]. 

At t = t0, this distance is 200 feet. So:



---------------

sqrt[(x_j(t0) - x_k(t0))² + 200²] = 200.

Squaring both sides:

(x_j(t0) - x_k(t0))² + 200² = 200² ⇒ (x_j(t0) - x_k(t0))² = 0 ⇒ x_j(t0) = x_k(t0).

Wait, that can't be. If their x-coordinates are equal, then they are vertically aligned, so their distance apart would be 200 feet (the vertical distance between the paths). But according to the problem statement, at the moment when the building first blocks their line of sight, they are 200 feet apart. So

---------------

 that must mean that their horizontal separation is zero, so they are directly across from each other? Hmm, but then the line between them would be vertical, passing through the center of the building. But the building is 100 feet in diameter, so its

---------------

 radius is 50. The line between them is along y=0, which is the center. Since the building is centered

---------------

 there, that line would pass through the building, so the line of sight is blocked. But the problem says that this is the first time their line of sight is blocked. Wait

---------------

, maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the line of sight is tangent to the building, so the line connecting their positions is tangent to the building. Let

---------------

 me re-examine that.

Suppose at time t0, the line between Jenny and Kenny is tangent to the building. The distance

---------------

 between them is given as 200 feet. Let me formalize this.

Let me denote Jenny's position as (x_j, 100) and Kenny's as (x_k, -100). The line connecting these two points must be tangent to the circle x² + y² = 50². The condition for tangency is that the distance from the center (0,0) to the line is equal to the radius (50). 

First, let's find the equation of the line between the two points. Let me denote the two points as (x_j, 100) and (x_k, -100). The slope of the line is m = (-100 - 100)/(x_k - x_j) = (-200)/(x_k - x_j). The equation of the line can be written as:

y - 100 = m(x - x_j)

The

---------------

 distance from (0,0) to this line must be 50. The formula for the distance from a point (x0,y0) to the line ax + by + c = 0 is |ax0 + by0 + c| / sqrt(a² + b²). Let me rearrange the line equation to standard form.

Starting with y - 100 = m(x - x_j), so y = m(x - x_j) + 100. Then, rearranged: mx - y - m x_j + 100 = 0. So coefficients are a = m, b = -1, c = -m x_j + 100.

Distance from (0,0) to this line is |0 + 0 + (-m x_j + 100)| / sqrt(m² + 1) = | -m x_j + 100 | / sqrt(m² + 1) = 50.

So:



---------------

| -m x_j + 100 | = 50 sqrt(m² + 1)

Also, the distance between Jenny and Kenny is 200 feet. The distance squared is (x_j - x_k)^2 + (200)^2 = (200)^2, so (x_j - x_k)^2 = 0 ⇒ x_j = x_k? Wait, that brings

---------------

 us back to the previous problem. Wait, the problem says that at the moment the building first blocks their line of sight, they are 200 feet apart. But

---------------

 according to this, that would require their horizontal separation to be zero, so they are directly opposite each other, but then the line between them would pass through the center of the building. Since

---------------

 the building is 100 feet in diameter, the line would pass through the center, so it's blocked. But maybe

---------------

 that is indeed the first time their line of sight is blocked? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the line of sight is tangent, so they

---------------

 are not directly opposite, but the line just touches the building, so the distance is greater?

Wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation here. Let's re

---------------

-examine the distance between them. The problem says that when the building first blocks their line of sight, they are 200 feet apart. So

---------------

 the distance between them is 200. Let me compute the distance between (x_j, 100) and (x_k, -100):

Distance squared is (x_j - x_k)^2 + (200)^2. Setting

---------------

 this equal to (200)^2, so (x_j - x_k)^2 = 0 ⇒ x_j = x_k. So that

---------------

 must mean that at that moment, they are aligned vertically, separated by 200 feet (the vertical distance). But if

---------------

 they are aligned vertically, the line between them passes through the center of the building, which is indeed blocked by the building. So that is

---------------

 the first time their line of sight is blocked. But why is this the first time? Because before that, their line of sight would have been unobstructed unless

---------------

 they were too close?

Wait, maybe I need to consider their positions over time. Let's think about their motion. Let me set

---------------

 up a coordinate system where at time t=0, Jenny is at some position, and Kenny is ahead or behind? Wait, since

---------------

 they are moving in the same direction, but at different speeds. Let me assume that at the initial time, when their line of sight is first blocked, that's t0. Let

---------------

 me set t0 as time 0 for simplicity, so that at t=0, their line of sight is first blocked, and they are 200 feet apart. Then, we need to find the time t when they can see each other again, so the

---------------

 line between them is no longer blocked by the building. The total time would then be t.

Wait, but the problem says "the amount of time, in seconds, before Jenny and Kenny can see each other again". So starting from the moment when the building first blocks their line of sight (t

---------------

0), how much time until they can see each other again. So we need to model their positions after t0, find when the line between them is no longer blocked by the building. Wait

---------------

, but first, let's get the setup correct.

Alternatively, perhaps we need to track their positions from some initial time, and

---------------

 find t0 when the line is first blocked, then find the next time when the line is unblocked again, and compute the difference between those times.

Alternatively, maybe setting

---------------

 t=0 as the time when the line is first blocked, then find t such that after moving, the line is tangent again?

---------------

 Hmm, perhaps. Let me think step by step.

First, let's model their positions. Let me set up coordinates such

---------------

 that at the time when their line of sight is first blocked (t0), Jenny is at (a, 100) and Kenny is at (a, -100), since their x-coordinates must be equal (from the distance being 200). Wait

---------------

, but their horizontal positions are the same? So they are directly aligned vertically. But if they are moving in the same direction, their

---------------

 x-coordinates are increasing. So if Jenny is behind Kenny? Wait, but since Kenny is moving faster, if they start at some point, maybe

---------------

 initially Jenny is ahead, but then Kenny catches up?

Wait, perhaps the key is to figure out their positions relative to the building when the line of sight is first blocked. Let me think again

---------------

.

Suppose that at time t0, they are at (x, 100) and (x, -100), so vertical

---------------

 separation. The line between them is vertical, passing through the center of the building. Since the building has radius 50, the vertical line at x would pass through the building only if |x| <= 50. Wait, but the building is centered at (0,0), so if their x-coordinate is 0, then the line passes through the center. But if they are at x = something else, then

---------------

 the line would be vertical at that x-coordinate. Wait, but the building is a circle, so a vertical line x = a would intersect the building if |a| <= 50. Therefore, if their x-coordinate is within -50 to 50, the line between them would pass through the building. So

---------------

 when they are at x beyond 50, the line would not pass through the building. Wait, but if they are moving in the positive x-direction, then when

---------------

 their x-coordinate is beyond 50, the vertical line between them would be outside the building? Wait, no. Wait

---------------

, if they are moving along the paths, which are at y=100 and y=-100, so a vertical line at x would only

---------------

 intersect the building (which is at y between -50 and 50) if |x| <= 50. So if their x-coordinate is greater than 50, then the vertical line at x would be to the right of the building, so the line between them would not intersect the building. Similarly for x < -50.

Therefore, the first time their line of sight is blocked would be when their x-coordinate is such

---------------

 that the vertical line between them is exactly at the edge of the building? Wait, no, because if they are moving towards

---------------

 the right, starting from the left, when they cross x=50, their vertical line would just graze the building? Wait, actually

---------------

, when they are at x=50, the vertical line would pass through the edge of the building at (50,0). So prior

---------------

 to that, their vertical line would have been to the left of the building (x <50), so the line between them would not pass through the building. Once they cross x=50, the vertical line would be to the right of the building, so the line between them would pass through the building?

---------------

 Wait, no. Wait, if their x-coordinate is 50, the vertical line x=50 would pass through the point (50,0) on the building. So the

---------------

 line between (50,100) and (50,-100) would pass through (50,0), which is on the building's edge. So that is the first time their line of sight is blocked. Because

---------------

 before that, when x <50, their vertical line would not intersect the building. Wait, but actually, if they are moving to the right, starting

---------------

 from the left, then as they approach x=50, their vertical line would start intersecting the building at x=50. So the first time their line of sight is blocked is exactly when they reach x=50? But at

---------------

 that point, their line is tangent to the building? Wait, no, the line is passing through the edge, so it's not tangent. Hmm

---------------

, maybe there's confusion here.

Alternatively, perhaps the line of sight is blocked when the line between them passes through the building. The first time that happens is when their vertical line is

---------------

 at x=50, so when their x-coordinate is 50, so the line between them just touches the building at that point. Wait, but actually

---------------

, the line between them would pass through the building when their x-coordinate is between -50 and 50. Wait, no

---------------

, if their x-coordinate is 50, then the vertical line at x=50 passes through the building's edge. So if

---------------

 they are moving to the right, then when they cross x=50, their vertical line would start passing through the building. Wait, but actually

---------------

, if they are at x=50, their vertical line is just touching the building, so perhaps that is the first time the building blocks their line of sight. But

---------------

 maybe before that, when their x was less than 50, their vertical line was to the left of the building, so their

---------------

 line of sight was unobstructed. Wait, but the building is centered between the paths, so if their vertical line is to the left of the building, then

---------------

 the line between them would still pass through the area where the building is? Wait, maybe I'm confused.

Wait, the building is a circle of radius 50 centered at (0,0). So the building occupies all points (x,y) where x² + y² ≤ 50². The paths are at y=100 and y=-100, which are outside

---------------

 the building. So if Jenny is at (x,100) and Kenny is at (x, -100), then the vertical line between them is x = some value. The line from

---------------

 (x,100) to (x,-100) is vertical. To see if this line is blocked by the building, we check if any part of the line passes through the building. The line is x = x-coordinate, from y=-100 to y=100. The building's

---------------

 y range is from -50 to 50. So the vertical line x would intersect the building if |x| ≤50. Therefore, if |x| ≤50, the vertical line passes through the building, so their line of sight is blocked. If |x| >50, the vertical line doesn't pass through the building, so they can see each other.

Therefore, the first time their line of sight is blocked is when their x-coordinate reaches 50 (assuming they are moving to the right). Wait, but if

---------------

 they start at some x <50 and move right, then when they cross x=50, their line of sight becomes blocked. Wait, but actually, when they are at x=50, the line just touches the edge of the building, so maybe

---------------

 that is when the blocking starts. But before that, when x was less than 50, their vertical line would have been to the left of the building, so not

---------------

 intersecting it, so they could see each other. Therefore, the first time their line of sight is blocked is at x=50. Therefore

---------------

, the problem states that at the moment when the building first blocks their line of sight (i.e., when x=50), they are 200 feet apart. Wait, but if they are at x=50, then their distance apart is sqrt( (0)^2 + (200)^2 ) = 200 feet, which matches the problem's condition. So that must

---------------

 be the setup.

Therefore, at the time when their x-coordinate is 50, they are 200 feet apart (vert

---------------

ically), and that is when the building first blocks their line of sight. So we need to find the time until they can see each other again. That would be when their x-coordinate is beyond 50 (

---------------

to the right), so that their vertical line is outside the building again. Wait, but actually, moving to the right beyond x=50, their vertical line is at x>50, which is outside the building's x range (since building is up to x=50). So once they pass x=50, their vertical line is no longer intersecting the building. Wait, but if

---------------

 they are moving to the right, once they go past x=50, their vertical line is to the right of the building, so the

---------------

 line between them doesn't intersect the building anymore. Therefore, the moment they can see each other again is when their x-coordinate is just

---------------

 beyond 50. But actually, since they are moving continuously, the exact time when they can see each other again is when their x-coordinate exceeds 50? Wait, but the

---------------

 problem might be considering when their line of sight is no longer blocked, which would be when their vertical line is outside the building, so once

---------------

 x>50. But since they are moving, the exact time when they can see each other again is the moment they pass x=50. Wait, but that

---------------

's the same moment when the blocking starts. That can't be.

Hmm, perhaps my coordinate system assumption is wrong. Let me think

---------------

 again. Maybe they are not moving in the same direction along the positive x-axis, but in some other direction? Wait, the problem says they're walking in the same direction on parallel paths. Let me confirm

---------------

:

The problem says: "Jenny and Kenny are walking in the same direction, Kenny at 3 feet per second and Jenny at 1 foot per second, on parallel paths that are 200 feet apart." So their paths are parallel and 200 feet apart, same

---------------

 direction. Let me set the coordinate system so that their paths are along the lines y = 100 and y = -100, as

---------------

 before. Let me assume they are walking along the positive x-direction. 

Suppose at time t=0, Jenny is at position (a, 100), and Kenny is at position (b, -100). Since they are moving in the same direction, their x-coordinates increase over time. Jenny

---------------

's position at time t is (a + t, 100), and Kenny's is (b + 3t, -100). 

The problem states that at the moment when the building first blocks their line of sight, they are 200 feet apart. Let me denote this time as t0. At that time, the line between them is tangent to the building. Wait, perhaps

---------------

 my previous assumption that the line is vertical is incorrect? Because if their line of sight is blocked when the line is tangent to the building, that might not be vertical.

Wait a second, maybe my mistake was assuming that when they are 200 feet apart, they are aligned vertically. But actually

---------------

, the distance between them is 200 feet, which could be along a diagonal. Let me recast the problem without assuming they

---------------

 are aligned vertically.

Let me start over. Let me denote their positions at time t as follows:

Jenny: (x_j(t), 100) = (x_j0 + t, 100)

Kenny: (x_k(t), -100) = (x_k0 + 3t, -100)

At time t0, the line between them is tangent to the building (the circle centered at (0,0) with radius 50). Additionally, the distance between them at that time is 200 feet.

We need to first find the positions at t0, then find the next time t1 when the line between them is no longer blocked (i.e., not

---------------

 intersecting the building), and compute t1 - t0.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as follows:

The line between Jenny and Kenny will be tangent to the building at time t0, and they

---------------

 are 200 feet apart. Then, after some time t, their positions will be such that the line between them is again tangent on the other side, allowing them to see each other again. Wait, perhaps?



---------------

Alternatively, maybe after the first tangent point, their line of sight is blocked until they move far enough so that the line between them no longer intersects the building. The

---------------

 exact time would be when their line of sight is tangent again on the other side, so that they can see each other again when

---------------

 the line is tangent. Wait, but tangency is when it just touches, so maybe after that, they can see each other.

---------------

 Hmm, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the line of sight is blocked when the line between them intersects the building, and unblocked when it doesn't. So the first time it's blocked is when the line is tangent (the

---------------

 first point of contact), and then remains blocked until they pass by, so the unblocking happens when they are far enough that the line no longer intersects the building. But

---------------

 in that case, the unblocking happens when their separation in x is such that the line between them doesn't pass through the building anymore.

Alternatively, let's think

---------------

 in terms of coordinates. Let me suppose that at time t0, their line of sight is first blocked. Since they are moving, the

---------------

 line between them must be tangent to the building at that moment. The distance between them at that moment is 200. Let

---------------

's model this.

Let me denote Jenny's position as (x1, 100) and Kenny's as (x2, -100) at time t0. The line between them is tangent to the circle x² + y² = 50². The tangent condition gives us that the distance from the center (0,0) to the line is equal to 50. The distance formula for

---------------

 the line between (x1,100) and (x2,-100) to the origin is 50. Also, the distance between the two points is 200.

Let me write

---------------

 equations for these conditions.

First, the distance between (x1,100) and (x2,-100) is 200:

√[(x1 - x2)^2 + (200)^2] = 200 ⇒ (x1 - x2)^2 + 40000 = 40000 ⇒ (x1 - x2)^2 = 0 ⇒ x1 = x2. Wait, so again we get that their x-coordinates must be equal? That

---------------

 would mean they are vertically aligned, so the line between them is vertical. But if they are vertically aligned at x-coordinate x, then the distance from the origin to the line is |x|, since the line is x = x1 = x2. The

---------------

 distance from (0,0) to this line is |x|. The building has radius 50, so |x| must equal 50 for the line to be tangent. Therefore, x

---------------

 = ±50. But since they are moving in the same direction (say, along positive x-axis), we can assume they are moving to the right, so the first time their line of sight is blocked is when they reach x = 50. At

---------------

 that point, their vertical line is tangent to the building (since |x| = 50). Wait, but if

---------------

 they are at x =50, then the line x=50 is tangent to the building at (50,0). Therefore, the line between them is just

---------------

 touching the building, so that is the first point of contact. Before that, when x <50, their vertical line didn

---------------

't touch the building, so they could see each other. At x=50, the line is tangent, so that

---------------

's the first time it's blocked. Then, beyond x=50, their vertical line is to the right of the building, so they can see each other again. Wait, but in

---------------

 that case, the time when they can see each other again is immediately after passing x=50? So the duration when

---------------

 their line of sight is blocked is just an instant? That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps my mistake is in assuming that the line of sight is blocked only when the line is tangent. Actually, if their vertical line passes through the building (i.e., |x| ≤50), then their line of sight is blocked. The first time their

---------------

 line of sight is blocked is when they enter the region |x| ≤50. Wait, but if they are moving to the right, starting from the left, then when

---------------

 they enter x=50, they start being blocked. But actually, when they are at x=50, they are just at the edge. So

---------------

 perhaps the blocking starts when they cross x=50? Wait, if their x is less than 50, their vertical line is to the left of the building, so not

---------------

 blocked. When their x is 50, the line is tangent, so just touching. When their x is greater than 50, the line is to the right, so not blocked. Wait, but then

---------------

 the blocking only occurs when their x is between -50 and 50? Wait no, the vertical line at any x between -50 and 50 would pass through the building. Wait, no

---------------

, the vertical line at x=30 would pass through the building's interior. Wait, actually, the vertical line at x=30 would pass through the building because

---------------

 the building's radius is 50 in the x direction. So any vertical line with |x| ≤50 would pass through the building, so

---------------

 their line of sight would be blocked whenever their x-coordinate is between -50 and 50. Therefore, the first time their line of sight is blocked is when they enter the region x ≤50 (assuming moving to the right). Wait, but they start

---------------

 from some initial position. Let me think of their starting positions.

Wait, the problem doesn't specify their initial positions, only that at the time when the building first blocks their line of sight, they are 200 feet apart. So we need to set up the equations accordingly.

Let me denote

---------------

 that at time t0, their positions are (x, 100) and (x, -100) because

---------------

 their x-coordinates must be equal (from the distance being 200). So the distance between them is sqrt( (x - x)^2 + (200)^2 ) = 200. So

---------------

 that checks out. The line between them is vertical at x, which must be tangent to the building, so |x| =50. Since they are moving to the right, we can assume x =50 at time t0. Therefore, at t0, Jenny is at (50, 100) and Kenny is at (50, -100). 

Now, we need to find the time t after t0 when they can see each other again. That would be when their vertical line is outside the building, i.e., their x-coordinate exceeds 50 (if

---------------

 moving right). Wait, but once they pass x=50, their vertical line is outside the building again. Wait, but their

---------------

 x-coordinates are moving forward. So after t0, their positions are moving to the right. The vertical line between them is at x =50 + (Jenny's speed)*(t - t0). Wait, actually

---------------

, their x positions are:

Jenny's x-coordinate at time t is 50 + (t - t0)*1 (since she moves at 1 ft/s).

Kenny's x-coordinate at time t is 50 + (t - t0)*3 (since he moves at 3 ft/s).

Wait, hold on. Wait, at time t0, both are at x=50. But Jenny

---------------

 is moving at 1 ft/s, so after time Δt = t - t0, her x is 50 + Δt*1.

Kenny is moving at 3 ft/s, so his x is 50 + Δt*3.

Therefore, their x-coordinates are no longer equal after t0. Therefore, the vertical line assumption only holds at t0. After that, their x-coordinates diverge. Therefore, the line between them is no longer vertical, so we have to consider the general case.

Ah! Here's the mistake. I

---------------

 assumed that at time t0, their x-coordinates are equal, but after that, they are moving at different speeds, so their x-coordinates will differ. Therefore, the line between them will no longer be vertical, so the blocking

---------------

 condition is different. Therefore, my previous assumption that they are aligned vertically only at t0 is correct, but after that, their positions spread

---------------

 out, so the line between them is not vertical anymore.

Therefore, the line of sight is blocked not only when they are vertically aligned but also when the line between them passes through the building. So after t0, even though their x-coordinates differ, the line between them might still pass through the building, so

---------------

 we need to calculate when the line no longer intersects the building.

Therefore, the problem requires us to find the next time t when the line between Jenny and Kenny does not intersect the building. Since they are moving away from the point of tangency, we

---------------

 need to find when the line between them is tangent again on the other side, or when their separation in x is such that the line doesn't intersect the building anymore.

Alternatively, the line of sight is blocked as long as the line between them intersects the building. The first time it's blocked is at t0 when they are tangent. Then, the blocking continues until the line is tangent again on the other side, after which they can see each other again. Wait, perhaps

---------------

.

Alternatively, the line of sight is blocked when the line between them intersects the building. The first time is when they enter

---------------

 the region where the line intersects the building, which is at t0. The last time the line is tangent is when they exit, so after that, the line no longer intersects. Therefore, the time until they can see each other again is the time between t0 and when they exit the region

---------------

 where the line intersects the building.

To solve this, we need to model the positions of Jenny and Kenny as functions of time after t0, and

---------------

 find the next time t1 when the line between them is tangent to the building, which would be the last point of contact, and then after that, they can see each other again. Therefore

---------------

, the time between t0 and t1 is the time until they can see each other again.

Alternatively, perhaps the line

---------------

 of sight is blocked until the line is tangent again on the other side, so the total time blocked is between the two tangent points, and the time we need is the duration from first tangent to the second tangent. Wait

---------------

, that might make sense.

Let me formalize this.

Let me consider the general case. Let me denote t=0 as the time when they are at the first tangent point (t0). So at t=0, their positions are (50,100) and (50, -100). From that

---------------

 point on, Jenny moves to the right at 1 ft/s, so her position at time t is (50 + t, 100). Kenny moves at 3 ft/s, so his position is (50 + 3t, -100). 

We need to find the next time t>0 when the line between them is tangent to the building (so that after that time, the line no longer intersects the building). The time between t=0 and that next tangent time is the time until they can see each other again. Wait, actually, once they pass the tangent point on the other side, their line of sight would be unobstructed. Hmm

---------------

, perhaps the time until they can see each other again is the time when the line between them is tangent again (the second tangent point), so

---------------

 that after that time, the line no longer intersects the building. So the duration from t=0 to that second tangent time is the time until they can see each other again. Wait

---------------

, but actually, after passing the tangent point, the line would be outside, so they can see each other at that tangent time?

---------------

 Hmm, perhaps the tangent is the point where the line just touches, so after that, they can see each other again. So

---------------

 the time until they can see each other again is the time until the second tangent.

Alternatively, perhaps the line of sight is blocked between the two tangent points. Therefore, the time between the first and second tangent is the duration of the blockage, and the time until they can see each other again is that duration. Wait, the problem says "the amount of time before Jenny and Kenny can see each other again", so starting from the first blockage, until the moment

---------------

 they can see again, which would be at the second tangent. So the time between the two tangent points is the answer.

Therefore, we need to find t>0 such that the line between (50 + t, 100) and (50 + 3t, -100) is tangent to the building. Let me set up the equations for that.

Let me denote Jenny's position at time t as (x_j, y_j) = (50 + t, 100), and Kenny's as (x_k, y_k) = (50 + 3t, -100). The line between these two points must be tangent to the circle x² + y² = 50².

The condition for tangency is that the distance from the center (0,0) to the line is equal to the radius, 50.

First, let's find the equation of the line between (x_j, y_j) and (x_k, y_k). Let's compute the slope:

Slope m = (y_k - y_j)/(x_k - x_j) = (-100 - 100)/( (50 + 3t) - (50 + t) ) = (-200)/(2t) = -100/t.

So the slope is -100/t. The equation of the line can be written using point-slope form. Let's use Jenny's point:

y - 100 = m(x - (50 + t))

Plugging in m:

y - 100 = (-100/t)(x - 50 - t)

Multiply both sides by t to eliminate the denominator:

t(y - 100) = -100(x - 50 - t)

Expand:

ty - 100t = -100x + 5000 + 100t

Bring all terms to left:

ty - 100t + 100x - 5000 - 100t = 0

Combine like terms:

100x + ty - 200t - 5000 = 0

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps rearranged as:

100x + ty - (200t + 5000) = 0

Wait

---------------

, perhaps better to write in standard form Ax + By + C = 0:

Starting from the slope-intercept form might be easier.

Alternatively, let me re

---------------

-derive the standard form properly.

Let me write the line equation again. Let me denote point (x_j, y_j) = (50 + t, 100), and (x_k, y_k) = (50 + 3t, -100). The line can

---------------

 be parametrized as:

Let me use variables x and y. The line passes through (50 + t, 100) and (50 + 3t, -100). The vector between these points is (2t, -200). So parametric equations:

x = 50 + t + 2t*s

y = 100 - 200*s, where s ranges from 0 to 1.

Alternatively, to

---------------

 get the standard equation:

The slope m is (-200)/(2t) = -100/t, as before. So the equation is:

y = (-100/t)(x - (50 + t)) + 100

Expanding:

y = (-100/t)x + (100/t)(50 + t) + 100

Simplify:

y = (-100/t)x + (5000/t + 100) + 100

Wait, that

---------------

's:

y = (-100/t)x + (5000/t + 100 + 100)?

Wait, no:

Wait, let's do

---------------

 it step by step:

First, expand (-100/t)(x - 50 - t):

= (-100/t)x + (100/t)(50 + t)

Then add 100:

y = [ (-100/t)x + (100*(50 + t)/t ) ] + 100

= (-100/t)x + (5000 + 100t)/t + 100

=

---------------

 (-100/t)x + 5000/t + 100 + 100 ?

Wait, no. Wait, (100*(50 + t))/t is 100*(50 + t)/t, so that

---------------

 term is (5000 + 100t)/t. Then adding 100 gives:

y

---------------

 = (-100/t)x + (5000 + 100t)/t + 100

To

---------------

 combine terms, let me express 100 as 100t/t:

= (-100/t)x + (5000 + 100t + 100t)/t

Wait, no, that's incorrect. Wait, 

---------------

100 is equal to 100*(t/t). So:

y = (-100/t)x + (5000 + 100t)/t + 100*(t/t)

= (-100/t)x + [5000 + 100t + 100t]/t

Wait, 100*(t/t) is 100t/t. So adding

---------------

 to (5000 + 100t)/t gives:

5000 + 100t + 100t over t?

---------------

 Wait, no:

Wait, actually:

Wait, (5000 + 100t)/t + 100 = (5000 + 100t)/t + (100t)/t = [5000 + 100t + 100t]/t = (5000 + 200t)/t.

Therefore, the equation simplifies to:

y = (-100/t)x + (5000 + 200t)/t

To

---------------

 write this in standard form Ax + By + C = 0:

Bring all terms to the left:

(100/t)x + y - (5000 + 200t)/t = 0

Multiply through by t to eliminate denominators:

100x + ty - (5000 + 200t) = 0

Thus, the standard form is:

100x + ty - 5000 - 200t = 0

So coefficients:

A = 100

B = t

C = -5000 -200t

Now, the distance from the origin (0,0) to this line must be equal to the radius 50. The distance formula is |A*0 + B*0 + C| / sqrt(A² + B²) = |C| / sqrt(A² + B²) = | -5000 -200t | / sqrt(100² + t²) = 50.

Therefore:

| -5000 -200t | / sqrt(10000 + t²) = 50

Multiply both sides by sqrt(10000 + t²):

| -5000 -200t | = 50 sqrt(10000 + t²)

Square both sides to eliminate the absolute value and square root:

(5000 + 200t)^2 = (50)^2 (10000 + t^2)

Compute

---------------

 left side:

(5000 + 200t)^2 = 5000² + 2*5000*200t + (200t)^2 = 25,000,000 + 2,000,000t + 40,000t²

Right side:

2500*(10,000 + t²) = 25,000,000 + 2500 t²

Set equal:

25,000,000 + 2,000,000t + 40,000t² = 25,000,000 + 2500 t²

Subtract 25,000,000 from both sides:

2,000,000t + 40,000t² = 2500 t²

Bring all terms to left:

2,000,000t + 40,000t² -2500t² =0 ⇒ 2,000,000t + 37,500t² =0

Factor out t:

t*(2,000,000 + 37,500t) =0

Solutions are t=0 and t = -2,000,000 / 37,500 = -53.333...

But since we are looking for t>0 (after the initial tangent at t=0), this suggests only t=0 is a solution? That can't be right. There

---------------

 must be an error in my calculations.

Wait a second, let me check the algebra again.

Left side after squaring: (5000 + 200t)^2

Let

---------------

 me re-calculate:

5000 squared is 25,000,000

200t squared is (200t)^2 = 40,000 t²

Cross term is 2*(5000)*(200t) = 2*5000*200*t = 2,000,000 t

So total

---------------

 left side: 25,000,000 + 2,000,000 t + 40,000 t². Correct.

Right side: 50 squared is 2500, so 2500*(10,000 + t²) = 25,000,000 + 2500 t². Correct.

So subtract right side from left side:

25,000,000 + 2,000,000 t + 40,000 t² -25,000,000 -2500 t² = 2,000,000 t + 37,500 t² =0. Correct.

Factor

---------------

 t: t(2,000,000 + 37,500 t)=0. So solutions at t=0 and t= -2,000,000 / 37,500 ≈ -53.333...

Hmm, so the only positive solution is t=0, which is the initial point. That suggests that there is no other time when the line is tangent to the building? That can't be.

---------------

 Where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made an error in setting up the equation. Let me check the standard form of the line equation again.

We

---------------

 had the line between (50 + t, 100) and (50 + 3t, -100). Wait, hold on, actually

---------------

, when we set t=0, we are at the initial tangent point. However, in the parametrization above, I

---------------

 think there was a confusion between the variable t (time) and the parameter in the line equation. Wait no, let me re

---------------

trace:

Wait, in this part of the problem, we set t=0 as the time when they are at the first tangent (positions

---------------

 (50,100) and (50,-100)), so Jenny's position at time t is (50 + t, 100), since she moves at 1 ft/s. Similarly, Kenny's position is (50 + 3t, -100). So the

---------------

 line between them at time t is between those two points. The equation of the line is correctly derived as above.

But according to the equation, the only time when the distance from the origin is 50 is at t=0 and t negative (which would be before the initial time). That suggests that after t=0, the line never again is tangent to the building, which contradicts the problem's premise that they can see each other again. So where

---------------

 is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the assumption that the line is tangent at t=0 is incorrect? Let me check the

---------------

 distance at t=0.

At t=0, the line is vertical at x=50, which is tangent to the building at (50,0). The distance from the origin to the line is indeed 50, so that's correct. But

---------------

 according to the equation, there is no other t where the line is tangent. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe after passing the building, their line of sight is unobstructed without

---------------

 needing another tangent? Let me think differently.

The line between them will block their view as long as the line passes through the building. The building is a circle of radius 50. The line will intersect the building whenever the distance from the center to the line is less than 50. The tangent is

---------------

 when the distance is exactly 50. So the line is tangent at two points: the first when they approach (t=0) and the second when they leave? Wait, but according to the equation, there is no other time when the distance is 50. Hmm

---------------

.

Wait, perhaps my error is in the sign when setting up the distance equation. The line equation's distance can be positive or negative, but absolute

---------------

 value is taken. Let me check the equation again.

We had:

The standard form is 100x + ty -5000 -200t =0

The

---------------

 distance from (0,0) is |C| / sqrt(A² + B²) where C is -5000 -200t, so | -5000 -200t | divided by sqrt(100² + t²). So

---------------

 the absolute value is correct.

But maybe there's another tangent on the other side? Wait, but as they move to the right, their line is going to tilt

---------------

 more and more, so maybe the distance from the center increases?

Wait, let's plug in some values. Let me try

---------------

 t=10 seconds.

At t=10:

Jenny is at (50 +10,100) = (60,100)

Kenny is at (50 +30, -100) = (80, -100)

Compute the line between (60,100) and (80,-100).

Slope m = (-200)/(20)= -10.

Equation: y -100 = -10(x -60)

=> y = -10x + 600 +100 = -10x +700

Distance from origin:

|0 +0 -700| / sqrt(10² +1²) = 700 / sqrt(101) ≈700/10.05≈69.65, which is greater than 50. So the distance is more than 50, so the line does not intersect the building. Therefore, at t=10, they can see each other.

Wait, but according to our equation, there is no other time when the distance is 50. So perhaps

---------------

 the line is only tangent at t=0, and then the distance becomes larger than 50 immediately after, meaning that after t=0, the line doesn't intersect the building anymore. Hence

---------------

, they can see each other immediately after t=0? But that contradicts the problem's implication that there is a time t needed.

Wait, but

---------------

 according to this calculation at t=10, the distance is already over 50, so the line doesn't intersect the building. So

---------------

 perhaps after t=0, the distance from the center to the line is always greater than 50, so the line never intersects the building again. Therefore, the line

---------------

 of sight is blocked only at t=0 (the tangent point) and immediately after, the line is outside, so they can see each other again right after t=0. But the problem says "the amount of time before Jenny and Kenny can see each other again", which would be zero? That can't be.

This

---------------

 suggests an error in my setup. Let me go back to the problem statement.

Problem says: "the instant when the building first blocks the line of sight between Jenny and Kenny, they are 200 feet apart." So that moment

---------------

 is when their line of sight is first blocked, and they are 200 feet apart. We took that as the point where they are vertically aligned at x=50, 

---------------

200 feet apart vertically. But according to the calculation, after that, their line of sight is unblocked because the line's

---------------

 distance from the center exceeds 50, so they can see each other again immediately. But that would mean the time t is zero, which contradicts the problem asking for a fraction.

Therefore

---------------

, my initial assumption must be wrong. Perhaps the line of sight is blocked not only when the line is tangent but also when it passes through the building. Wait

---------------

, but if the distance from the center to the line is less than the radius, then the line intersects the building. So if

---------------

 the distance is less than 50, the line passes through the building, blocking the view. The first time the line is tangent (distance=50) is when they are

---------------

 exactly at 200 apart. Then, as they move, the distance from the center to the line might become less than 50, meaning the line is

---------------

 now passing through the building, so the view is blocked again? Wait, but according to the calculation at t=10, the distance was 69.65, which is greater than 50, so the line doesn't intersect the building. Hmm

---------------

.

Wait, let me recalculate the distance at t=10 using the formula:

The distance from the origin to the line at time t is | -5000 -200t | / sqrt(100² + t²). At

---------------

 t=10:

Numerator: | -5000 -2000 | = 7000

Denominator: sqrt(10000 + 100) = sqrt(10100) ≈100.4987

So distance ≈7000 / 100.5 ≈69.65, which is correct. So the

---------------

 distance is increasing, meaning the line is moving away from the building. Therefore, after t=0, the distance from the center to the line increases, so the line is

---------------

 no longer intersecting the building. Hence, they can see each other again immediately after t=0. Therefore, the time t is zero, which is impossible.

Therefore, my entire

---------------

 approach must be flawed. Let me re-express the problem.

Alternative approach: Let me consider their positions as functions of time without setting t0 as zero.

Let me let t be the time variable since some initial moment. Let me denote

---------------

 their positions:

Jenny: (x_j(t), 100) = (v_j * t + x_j0, 100)

Kenny: (x_k(t), -100) = (v_k * t + x_k0, -100)

Given that they are walking in the same direction, let's say along the positive x-axis, so their velocities are positive. Let me assume that at time t=0, Jenny is at (0, 100), and Kenny is at some position (d, -100), so that they start separated along the path. But the problem doesn't specify their starting positions, only that at the time when the building first blocks their line of sight, they are 200 feet apart.

Alternatively, let me set

---------------

 up the problem with variables and find the time difference.

Let me denote that at the time when their line of sight is first blocked (time t1), their distance is 200. Let me call

---------------

 their positions at that time:

Jenny: (x1, 100)

Kenny: (x2, -100)

The line between them is tangent to the building, so distance from center to line is 50, and distance between them is 200.

Additionally

---------------

, their velocities are 1 and 3 ft/s, so:

x1 = x_j0 + 1*t1

x2 = x_k0 + 3*t1

But we need more equations. The

---------------

 distance between them is 200:

sqrt( (x1 - x2)^2 + (200)^2 ) = 200 ⇒ (x1 - x2)^2 =0 ⇒ x1 =x2.

So again

---------------

, they must be vertically aligned at that time. The line between them is vertical at x =x1 =x2, so the distance from the center is |x1|. To

---------------

 be tangent, this must equal 50 ⇒ x1 = ±50. Assuming they are moving to the right, we

---------------

 take x1 =50. So at time t1, Jenny is at (50, 100), and Kenny is at (50, -100).

Their

---------------

 positions as functions of time:

Jenny: x_j(t) =50 - (x_j0 - (50 - t1))? Wait, no

---------------

. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps better to set t=0 as the time when their line of sight is first blocked. Then, at t=0, they are at (50,100) and (50, -100). Then, their positions at time t are:

Jenny: (50 + t*1, 100)

Kenny: (50 + t*3, -100)

We need to find the next time t>0 when the line between them is tangent to the building (so that after that, they can see each other). But according to previous calculations, that never

---------------

 happens again. But the problem states that such a time exists.

Alternatively, perhaps the line of sight is blocked when the line passes through the building, so as

---------------

 long as the distance from the center to the line is less than or equal to 50. The first time is when it's exactly 50 (t=0). Then, as they move, the distance becomes less than 50, so the line is

---------------

 inside the building, so the view is blocked. Wait, but our previous calculation at t=10 gave a distance of ~69.65>50, so the line is outside. Hmm

---------------

, maybe the distance formula was miscalculated?

Wait, let's recalculate the distance from the center to the line at time t using

---------------

 the formula.

The line equation at time t is between (50 + t,100) and (50 + 3t, -100).

The

---------------

 standard form equation was found to be:

100x + ty - 5000 -200t =0

Therefore

---------------

, the distance from (0,0) is | -5000 -200t | / sqrt(100² + t²)

Wait, so

---------------

 when t increases, the numerator's absolute value is | -5000 -200t | = 5000 + 200t (since t is positive). The denominator is sqrt(10000 + t²). 

So

---------------

 the distance is (5000 + 200t)/sqrt(10000 + t²)

We want to find when this distance is equal to 50 again.

---------------

 Setting up:

(5000 + 200t)/sqrt(10000 + t²) =50

Multiply both sides by sqrt(10000 + t²):

5000 + 200t =50 sqrt(10000 + t²)

Square both sides:

(5000 + 200t)^2 = 2500(10000 + t²)

Expand left side:

5000² + 2*5000*200t + (200t)^2 =2500*10000 +2500 t²

25,000,000 + 2,000,000 t +40,000 t² =25,000,000 +2500 t²

Subtract 25,000,000 from both sides:

2,000,000 t +40,000 t² =2500 t²

Bring all terms to left:

2,000,000 t +37,500 t² =0

Factor:

t(2,000,000 +37,500 t)=0 ⇒ t=0 or t= -2,000,000/37,500 ≈-53.33

Thus

---------------

, only solution at t=0, which again suggests that after that, the distance is always greater than 50, so the line does not intersect the building, so they can see each other immediately after t=0. Therefore

---------------

, the time t is zero, which contradicts the problem's question.

This suggests that my entire model is wrong, so

---------------

 perhaps I misunderstood the problem's setup.

Wait, let me re-read the problem:

"Jenny and Kenny are walking in the same direction, Kenny at 3 feet per second and Jenny at 1 foot per second, on parallel paths that are 200 feet apart. A tall circular building 100 feet in diameter is centered midway between the paths. At the instant when the building first blocks the line of sight between Jenny and Kenny, they are 200 feet apart. Let t be the amount of time, in seconds, before Jenny and Kenny can see each other again. If t is written as a fraction in lowest terms, what is the sum of the numerator and denominator?"

Wait

---------------

, maybe the 200 feet apart is along the line of sight, not the straight-line distance. Wait, the problem says "they are 200 feet apart". Typically

---------------

, that would mean straight-line distance, but maybe along their paths?

Wait, the problem says "they are 200 feet apart". Since they are on parallel paths, their separation along the direction of travel would be the difference in their x positions. The

---------------

 straight-line distance between them would be sqrt( (Δx)^2 + 200^2 ). The problem states that at the moment the building first blocks their line of sight, their straight-line distance is 200 feet. Therefore

---------------

, that requires that sqrt( (Δx)^2 +200^2 ) =200 ⇒ Δx=0 ⇒ they are aligned vertically, which is what I had before.

Therefore

---------------

, my calculations are correct, but the problem's answer is zero, which can't be. Therefore, my mistake must be in assuming the direction of motion or the coordinate system.

Wait, perhaps they are walking in the opposite direction? Wait

---------------

, no, problem says same direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the building is not centered midway between the paths. Wait, problem says "centered midway between the paths". Since paths are 200 feet apart, midway is 100 feet from each.

Alternatively, perhaps the building's diameter is 100 feet, so radius 50, but the

---------------

 distance from the paths is 100 feet, so the distance from each path to the building's edge is 100 -50=50 feet. So when

---------------

 they are 50 feet away from the building along their paths, their line of sight is blocked.

Wait, perhaps the

---------------

 line of sight is blocked not when the line is tangent to the building, but when the line passes through the building. The first time that happens is when they are aligned

---------------

 vertically at x=50, but then as they move further, their line of sight may again be blocked when they are on the other side?

Wait, no

---------------

. If they are moving to the right, once they pass x=50, their vertical line is to the right of the building, so their line of sight is unblocked. But

---------------

 if they were to move in such a way that their line of sight wraps around the building, but since they are moving in straight lines on parallel paths, their line of sight can

---------------

 only be blocked when their vertical line is within the building's x-range. 

Alternatively, maybe I got the direction of their

---------------

 motion wrong. Suppose they are walking to the left instead of the right. Let's try that.

Suppose they are walking to the left (negative x-direction). Then

---------------

, their initial positions at the blocking time t0 would be at x=-50, so the line is tangent at (-50,0). Then, as they move left, their x-co

---------------

ordinates become more negative. The line between them would then be vertical at x=-50 - t (for Jenny) and x=-50 -3t (for Kenny). Wait, no, their velocities are in the negative direction, so positions would be:

Jenny's position at time t after t0: (-50 - t,100)

Kenny's position: (-50 -3t, -100)

Then the line between them is between those two points. Let's compute the distance from the center.

Following

---------------

 similar steps as before:

Slope m = (-100 -100)/( (-50 -3t) - (-50 -t) ) = (-200)/(-2t) = 100/t

Equation of the line using Jenny's point:

y -100 = (100/t)(x +50 + t)

Multiply through by t:

ty -100t = 100x + 5000 +100t

Rearranged:

-100x + ty - 200t -5000 =0

Distance from origin:

| -5000 -200t | / sqrt( (-100)^2 + t^2 ) = same as before, leading to the same issue.

Hmm

---------------

, still only t=0.

Wait, maybe the problem is that when they are moving in the same direction, one is catching up to the other. Suppose

---------------

 Jenny is behind Kenny, moving slower, so Kenny pulls ahead. Wait, but Jenny is slower, so if they start at the same point, Kenny would get ahead. Maybe

---------------

 their initial positions are such that Jenny is ahead, so that when they are 200 feet apart (vertically), their line of sight is first blocked.

Alternatively, perhaps my coordinate system has

---------------

 the paths at y=100 and y=-100, but the building is between them, so if they are moving along the x-axis, their line of sight is

---------------

 blocked when the line between them passes through the building. The first time this happens is when they are aligned vertically at x=50 or x=-50. After

---------------

 that, as they continue moving in the same direction, their separation in the x-direction increases, so the line between them til

---------------

ts and moves away from the building, so the distance from the center increases, meaning the line doesn't intersect the building anymore. Thus, the only time the line is tangent is at the first blockage, and after that, the line is outside, so they can see each other immediately. Hence

---------------

, the time t is zero, which contradicts the problem's requirement.

This suggests that perhaps the problem intends the line of sight to be blocked when the line passes through the building, and

---------------

 the first time this occurs is when they are 200 feet apart (vertically aligned at x=50). Then, the time until they can see each other again is the time until their line

---------------

 of sight no longer passes through the building. Since after passing x=50, their line of sight is outside, so the time is zero. This can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the error

---------------

 is in assuming their line of sight is blocked only when the line is tangent or passing through. Maybe the line of sight is blocked when the line passes through the building, so the

---------------

 duration they are blocked is until their line of sight is no longer intersecting the building. The first time is when their line enters the building's area, and the last time is when their line exits.

Wait

---------------

, if they are moving to the right, then before x=50, their line of sight is unblocked. At x=50, it starts

---------------

 being blocked (tangent), and as they move further right, their line of sight is still blocked because the line between them passes through the building until their x-co

---------------

ordinates are such that the line no longer intersects the building.

Wait, but according to previous calculations, the distance from the center to the line increases as they move right, so the line moves away from the building, meaning the distance is greater than 50, so the line doesn't intersect the building. So the

---------------

 line of sight is blocked only at the tangent point, and immediately after, it's unblocked. Hence the time is zero.

But the problem states

---------------

 they are 200 feet apart at the first blockage. Maybe the 200 feet is their separation along the path? Wait

---------------

, if they are on parallel paths 200 feet apart, their separation along the direction of travel would be the difference in their x positions. If they are moving in the same direction, with

---------------

 Kenny faster, then the separation along the path would be (Kenny's x - Jenny's x). 

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the problem's "200 feet apart" refers to their separation along the path. So if they're on parallel paths, their distance along the path is the difference in their x positions, so if

---------------

 that is 200 feet, then their straight-line distance would be sqrt(200² +200²)= 200√2≈282.8 feet. But the problem says they are 200 feet apart, so that must be the straight-line distance.

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps my coordinate system is flipped. Let me try a different coordinate system where the paths are horizontal, so their y-coordinates are 

---------------

0 and 200, and they walk along the x-axis. The building is centered midway between the paths, so at y=100, but diameter

---------------

 100, so radius 50. Wait, that would make the building's top at y=150 and bottom at y=50. Then

---------------

, Jenny on the lower path (y=0) and Kenny on the upper path (y=200). Wait

---------------

, perhaps this is a different configuration.

Let me try this setup:

Let me place the two paths as the x-axis (Jenny) and the line y = 200 (Kenny). The building is a circle of diameter 100, so radius 50, centered midway between the paths, so at (0,100). The equation is x² + (y -100)^2 = 50².

They are walking in the same direction, say along the positive x-axis. Jenny's position at time t is (x_j(t), 0) = (x_j0 + t, 0). Kenny's position is (x_k(t), 200) = (x_k0 + 3t, 200).

At the time when the building first blocks their line of sight, they are 200 feet apart. Let's denote this time as t0. At that time, the line between them is tangent to the building, and their distance is 200.

Let me denote

---------------

 their positions at t0 as (a,0) and (b,200). The distance between them is sqrt( (a - b)^2 + (200)^2 ) = 200 ⇒ (a - b)^2 +40000 =40000 ⇒ a = b. So they must be aligned horizontally at the same x-coordinate a = b. The line between them is vertical line x =a, which

---------------

 must be tangent to the building.

The building is centered at (0,100) with radius 50. The vertical line x=a will be tangent to the building if the distance from the center to the line is equal to the radius. The distance from (0,100) to x=a is |a|. So

---------------

 |a| =50 ⇒ a=±50. Since they are moving to the right, we take a=50. Thus, at time t0, they are both at x=50, so their positions are (50,0) and (50,200). The line between them is the vertical line x=50, tangent to the building at (50,100).

Now, their velocities: Jenny moves at 1 ft/s, so after time Δt from

---------------

 t0, her position is (50 + Δt, 0). Kenny moves at 3 ft/s, so his position is (50 + 3Δt, 200). We need to find the next time Δt>0 when they can see each other again, i.e., when the line between them doesn't pass through the building.

The line between (50 + Δt,0) and (50 +3Δt,200) must not intersect the building. We need to find when the line no longer intersects the building, which occurs when the distance from the center (0,100) to the line is greater than 50.

Let me compute the equation of the line between these two points.

Let me denote Δt as t for simplicity. So points are (50 + t, 0) and (50 + 3t, 200). The slope m is (200 -0)/( (50+3t) - (50+t) ) = 200/(2t) = 100/t.

Equation using point (50 + t, 0):

y -0 = (100/t)(x - (50 + t))

So

---------------

 y = (100/t)x - (100/t)(50 + t) = (100/t)x - 5000/t -100.

Rearranged to standard form:

(100/t)x - y -5000/t -100 =0

Multiply through by t to eliminate denominators:

100x - ty -5000 -100t =0

So standard form: 100x - ty - (5000 +100t) =0

Distance from center (0,100) to this line:

|100*0 -1*100 - (5000 +100t)| / sqrt(100² + (-t)^2 )

= | -100 -5000 -100t | / sqrt(10000 + t²)

= | -5100 -100t | / sqrt(10000 + t²)

This distance must be greater than 50 for the line to not intersect the building.

We want to find the smallest t>0 where this distance exceeds 50. The

---------------

 first time they can see each other again is when the distance becomes equal to 50 again, but on the other side.



---------------

Wait, let's set the distance equal to 50:

| -5100 -100t | / sqrt(10000 + t²) =50

Since t>0, the numerator is negative inside absolute value:

| -5100 -100t | =5100 +100t

Thus:

(5100 +100t)/sqrt(10000 +t²)=50

Multiply both sides by sqrt(10000 +t²):

5100 +100t =50 sqrt(10000 +t²)

Square both sides:

(5100 +100t)^2 =2500(10000 +t²)

Expand left side:

5100² + 2*5100*100t + (100t)^2 =2500*10000 +2500 t²

Calculate term by term:

5100² = (5000+100)^2 =5000² + 2*5000*100 +100²=25,000,000 +1,000,000 +10,000=26,010,000

2*5100*100t =2*5100*100 t =1,020,000 t

(100t)^2 =10,000 t²

Right side:

2500*10,000 =25,000,000

2500 t²

So left side total:

26,010,000 +1,020,000t +10,000t²

Right side total:

25,000,000 +2,500t²

Bring all terms to left:

26,010,000 +1,020,000t +10,000t² -25,000,000 -2,500t² =0

Simplify:

1,010,000 +1,020,000t +7,500t² =0

Divide all terms by 100 to simplify:

10,100 +10,200t +75t² =0

This

---------------

 is a quadratic equation:75t² +10,200t +10,100=0

Let me divide all terms by 25 to simplify further:

3t² + 408t +404 =0

Now, use

---------------

 quadratic formula:

t = [-408 ±√(408² -4*3*404)]/(2*3)

Compute discriminant:

408² = (400+8)^2=160,000 +6,400 +64=166,464

4*3*404=12*404=4,848

Thus discriminant=166,464 -4,848=161,616

√161,616 = 402 (since 400²=160,000, 402²=161,604, which is close, but exact

---------------

 sqrt(161,616)=402.000000… Wait 402² = 402*402 = (400+2)^2 = 160,000 + 1,600 +4=161,604. Hmm, so

---------------

 161,616 -161,604=12. So not a perfect square. Hmm

---------------

, mistake?

Wait, let me re-calculate discriminant:

408²: 400² + 2*400*8 +8² =160,000 + 6,400 +64=166,464

4*3*404 = 12*404= 4,848

166,464 -4,848 = 161,616

√161,616: let's see 402²=161,604. 161,616-161,604=12. So sqrt(161,616)=402 + 12/(2*402) approximately, but not exact. So

---------------

 discriminant is not a perfect square, which complicates.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in calculation steps. Let me re

---------------

trace the steps with this coordinate system.

Starting over in this coordinate system:

Building centered at (0,100), radius 50.

At time t0, they are at (50,0) and (50,200), distance between them is 200 (vertical). The

---------------

 line is tangent at (50,100).

After time Δt, their positions are:

Jenny: (50 + Δt, 0)

Kenny: (50 + 3Δt, 200)

Line

---------------

 equation between these points:

Slope m = (200 -0)/( (50+3Δt -50 -Δt) ) = 200/(2Δt)=100/Δt

Equation: y = (100/Δt)(x -50 -Δt) +0

Thus

---------------

, y = (100/Δt)x - (100/Δt)(50 +Δt)

Standard

---------------

 form:

(100/Δt)x - y - (5000/Δt +100) =0

Multiply by Δt:

100x - Δt y -5000 -100Δt =0

Distance from (0,100):

|100*0 - Δt*100 -5000 -100Δt| / sqrt(100² + (Δt)^2 )

Wait, let

---------------

 me re-calculate:

Wait, the standard form is 100x - (Δt)y -5000 -100Δt =0.

So coefficients are A=100, B= -Δt, C= -5000 -100Δt.

Distance from (0,100):

|A*0 + B*100 + C| / sqrt(A² + B²)

= | -Δt*100 -5000 -100Δt | / sqrt(100² + (Δt)^2 )

= | -200Δt -5000 | / sqrt(10000 + (Δt)^2 )

Set

---------------

 equal to 50:

| -200Δt -5000 | =50 sqrt(10000 + (Δt)^2 )

Square both sides:

(200Δt +5000)^2 =2500(10000 + (Δt)^2 )

Expand left side:

(200Δt)^2 +2*200Δt*5000 +5000² =40,000(Δt)^2 +20,000,000Δt +25,000,000

Right side:

2500*10,000 +2500(Δt)^2 =25,000,000 +2500(Δt)^2

Bring all terms to left:

40,000(Δt)^2 +20,000,000Δt +25,000,000 -25,000,000 -2500(Δt)^2 =0

Simplify:

(40,000 -2,500)(Δt)^2 +20,000,000Δt =0

37,500(Δt)^2 +20,000,000Δt=0

Factor:

Δt(37,500Δt +20,000,000)=0

Solutions Δt=0 or Δt= -20,000,000/37,500= -533.333...

Again

---------------

, only positive solution is Δt=0. So this also gives no solution for Δt>0. So this suggests

---------------

 that in this coordinate system also, the distance never again reaches 50, so they can see each other immediately after t0. 



---------------

This is perplexing. Maybe the problem is intended to have them moving in opposite directions? The problem says "same direction".

Alternatively, perhaps the 

---------------

200 feet apart is not the straight-line distance but along the path. If they are on parallel paths 200 feet apart, their separation along the path is the difference in their x positions. If that is 200 feet, then their straight-line distance is sqrt(200² +200²)=200√2≈282.8, but the problem says they are 200 feet apart, so that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the line

---------------

 of sight is blocked when the line passes through the building, so the duration they are blocked is until their line of sight is

---------------

 tangent again on the other side. But according to calculations, this never happens. 

Wait, perhaps the error is in the direction

---------------

 of the line of sight. Suppose they are walking towards each other? But the problem says same direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the building is not between the paths but somewhere

---------------

 else. Wait, the problem says "midway between the paths", so the center is between them.

Wait, let me try another

---------------

 approach using relative motion.

Let me consider Jenny as stationary, and Kenny moving at 3-1=2 ft/s relative to Jenny. The paths are 200 feet apart. The building is a

---------------

 circle of radius 50 at the midpoint. The line of sight between them is blocked when the line passes through the building. 

At the moment the building first blocks their line of sight, they are 200 feet apart. Let

---------------

 me consider their positions at that time: they must be aligned vertically (since distance is 200), so the line is tangent. Then, as time progresses, the relative motion between

---------------

 them is such that Kenny moves away from Jenny at 2 ft/s. 

The line between them will eventually become tangent again on the other side when the relative position

---------------

 has moved enough such that the line is tangent again. The time taken would be the time it takes for the relative motion to move

---------------

 from the first tangent to the second tangent.

Let me model this with coordinates:

Let me set the initial time (when blocked first) as t=0, with Jenny at (0,0) and Kenny at (0,200). The building is at (0,100) with radius 50. Wait, no, the

---------------

 paths are 200 apart, so if Jenny is at (0,0), Kenny is at (0,200). The building is centered at (0,100), radius 50. The line between them is the vertical line x=0, tangent at (0,100). 

Now, assuming

---------------

 they move in the positive x-direction, with Jenny at 1 ft/s and Kenny at 3 ft/s, their relative speed is 2 ft/s in x-direction. So after time t, Jenny is at (t,0), Kenny is at (3t,200). The line between them must be tangent to the circle (x)^2 + (y-100)^2=50^2.

The line between (t,0) and (3t,200). Let me find when this line is tangent to the circle.

The condition for tangency is that the distance from the center (0,100) to the line is 50.

Let

---------------

 me compute the equation of the line between (t,0) and (3t,200).

Slope m=(200-0)/(3t -t)=200/(2t)=100/t.

Equation using point (t,0):

y= (100/t)(x -t)

=>

---------------

 y= (100/t)x -100

Standard form: (100/t)x - y -100=0

Distance from (0,100):

| (100/t)(0) -1*(100) -100 | / sqrt( (100/t)^2 +1 )

= | -200 | / sqrt( (10000/t²)+1 )

= 200 / sqrt(10000/t² +1 )

Set equal to 50:

200 / sqrt(10000/t² +1 ) =50

Multiply both sides by denominator:

200 =50 sqrt(10000/t² +1 )

Divide both sides by50:

4= sqrt(10000/t² +1 )

Square both sides:

16=10000/t² +1 ⇒ 10000/t²=15 ⇒ t²=10000/15 ⇒ t=100/√15= (100√15)/15= (20√15)/3≈20*3.87298/3≈25.82 seconds.

This

---------------

 is the time when the line is tangent again on the other side. Therefore, the time between t=0 and t=20√15/3 is when they can see each other again. Thus

---------------

, the answer is 20√15/3 seconds. But this is irrational, but the problem states the answer should be a fraction.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me re

---------------

check the calculation.

Starting from the distance formula:

200 / sqrt(10000/t² +1 ) =50

Multiply

---------------

 both sides by sqrt(10000/t² +1):

200 =50 sqrt(10000/t² +1 )

Divide by 50:

4 = sqrt(10000/t² +1 )

Square both sides:

16 =10000/t² +1 ⇒10000/t²=15 ⇒t²=10000/15 ⇒t=100/sqrt(15)= (100 sqrt(15))/15= (20 sqrt(15))/3. 



---------------

This is indeed the time when the line is tangent again. Therefore, the time between the first blockage (t=0) and the second tangent (t=20√15/3) is the time when they can see each other again. But

---------------

 wait, after the second tangent, the distance from the center would be greater than 50 again, so they can see each other. Thus

---------------

, the time until they can see each other again is 20√15/3 seconds. But the problem asks

---------------

 for the answer as a fraction. Since sqrt(15) is irrational, this suggests an error in the approach.

Wait, in this coordinate

---------------

 system, the paths are vertical (along y-axis?), but in my last approach I set paths as horizontal. Let me verify

---------------

 the coordinate system again.

Wait, in this latest approach, I considered paths as horizontal lines at y=0 and y=200, with building at (0,100). Jenny

---------------

 moves along x-axis (path y=0), and Kenny along y=200. Their line of sight is blocked when the line between them passes through the building. The first blockage occurs when they are vertically aligned at x=0, separated

---------------

 by 200 feet vertically. Then, moving to the right, their line becomes tangent again at time t=20√15/3. But

---------------

 this requires the answer to be a fraction, but this is irrational.

Hmm, perhaps there was an error in the coordinate system setup. Let me try

---------------

 to re-express the problem with paths as vertical lines.

Suppose the two paths are vertical lines 200 feet apart, say at x=0 and x=200. The building is centered midway, so at x=100, y=0, with diameter 100, so radius 50. Jenny and Kenny walk along the paths in the same direction, say upwards along the y-axis. 



---------------

At the time when the building first blocks their line of sight, they are 200 feet apart. Let's see

---------------

:

Their positions at that time must be such that the line between them is tangent to the building. The distance between them is 200 feet. 

Let

---------------

 me denote Jenny's position as (0, y_j) and Kenny's as (200, y_k). The distance between them is sqrt(200² + (y_j - y_k)^2)=200 ⇒ (y_j - y_k)^2 =0 ⇒ y_j = y_k. So they are aligned horizontally. The line between them is horizontal line y=y_j, which must be tangent to the building at (100±50, y_j). The building is at x=100, radius 50. A horizontal tangent line would be y=0±50, so y=50 or y=-50. Since they are walking upwards, assume

---------------

 y=50. So at the first blockage, they are at (0,50) and (200,50). The line y=50 is tangent to the building at (150,50) and (50,50). Wait, but the building is at x=100, so equation (x-100)^2 + y^2 =50^2. A horizontal line y=50 would intersect the building at (100 ± sqrt(50² -50²),50)

---------------

 ⇒ (100±0,50). So the line y=50 is tangent at (100,50).

Thus, their line of sight is blocked at y=50. After

---------------

 that, as they move upward, their horizontal separation remains 200 feet, so their line of sight is the horizontal line between (0,y) and (200,y), which will no

---------------

 longer intersect the building once y exceeds 50 or goes below -50. Since they are moving upward, after y=50, their line of sight is above the building, so they can see each other again immediately after passing y=50. So the time is

---------------

 zero again.

This is also not working. 

Perhaps the problem requires considering that the line of sight is blocked when it intersects the building, and the first time this happens is when they are 200 apart, then they continue

---------------

 moving and the line of sight exits the building after some time. The duration between first contact and last contact with the building is the time blocked, so the time until they can see each other again is the duration from

---------------

 first tangent to last tangent.

In the previous coordinate system where the paths were horizontal at y=0 and y=200, the line between them starts

---------------

 tangent at (50,100), and as they move right, the line's distance from the center increases, so it never re

---------------

-enters. But if they were moving left, then after the tangent at x=50, moving left would take

---------------

 them to x=-50, and the line would again be tangent. Let's try this.

Let me assume they are moving to the left (negative x direction). At

---------------

 the first blockage, they are at (50,0) and (50,200). Then, moving left, their positions at time t are (50 -t,0) and (50 -3t,200). The line between them must

---------------

 be tangent to the building again when moving left.

The line between (50 -t,0) and (50-3t,200). Let's compute when this line is tangent to the building centered at (0,100), radius 50.

Equ

---------------

ation of the line:

Slope m = (200 -0)/( (50-3t)-(50-t) )=200/(-2t)= -100/t

Equation using point (50-t,0):

y -0 = (-100/t)(x - (50 -t))

y = (-100/t)x + (100/t)(50 -t)

= (-100/t)x + 5000/t -100

Standard form: (100/t)x + y -5000/t +100 =0

Wait, expanding

---------------

:

y = (-100/t)x +5000/t -100

Bring all terms to left:

(100/t)x + y -5000/t +100 =0

Multiply by t to eliminate denominators:

100x + ty -5000 +100t =0

Standard form:100x + ty + (100t -5000)=0

Distance from (0,100):

|100*0 + t*100 +100t -5000| / sqrt(100² + t²)

= |200t -5000| / sqrt(10000 +t²)

Set equal to 50:

|200t -5000| / sqrt(10000 +t²) =50

Since

---------------

 moving left, t>0, so 200t -5000 could be negative or positive. 



---------------

Case 1: 200t -5000 = - (distance value), so absolute value:

|200t -5000|= |5000 -200t|

Thus:

(5000 -200t)/sqrt(10000 +t²)=50

Multiply both sides:

5000 -200t =50 sqrt(10000 +t²)

Square both sides:

(5000 -200t)^2 =2500(10000 +t²)

Expand left:

5000² -2*5000*200t + (200t)^2 =2500*10000 +2500t²

25,000,000 -2,000,000t +40,000t² =25,000,000 +2,500t²

Subtract 25,000,000:

-2,000,000t +40,000t² =2,500t²

Bring all terms to left:

-2,000,000t +37,500t²=0

Factor:

t(-2,000,000 +37,500t)=0 ⇒ t=0 or t=2,000,000/37,500=53.333...

Thus, t=53.333... seconds.

---------------

 

So at t=53.333..., the line is tangent again on the left side of the building. Therefore

---------------

, the time between first blockage (t=0) and being able to see again (after t=53.333...) is 53.333... seconds. 



---------------

Thus, the answer is 160/3 (since 53.333... is 160/3).

---------------

 Wait, 2,000,000 divided by 37,500:

2,000,000 /37,500 = (2,000,000 ÷ 25)/(37,500 ÷25)=80,000/1500= (80,000 ÷ 100)/(1500 ÷100)=800/15=160/3 ≈53.333...

So 160/3 is the time. Thus

---------------

, the fraction is 160/3, which reduces to lowest terms is already there. Sum numerator + denominator:160+3=163.

Therefore

---------------

, the answer is 163.

**Final Answer**
Answer: 163


Jenny and Kenny are walking in the same direction on parallel paths 200 feet apart, with Jenny at 1 foot per second and Kenny at 3 feet per second. A circular building with a 100-foot diameter (radius 50 feet) is centered midway between their paths. We need to determine the time \( t \) when they can see each other again after the building first blocks their line of sight, given they are 200 feet apart at that moment.

1. **Setup and Coordinates**:
   - Paths are along \( y = 0 \) (Jenny) and \( y = 200 \) (Kenny).
   - The building is centered at \( (0, 100) \) with radius 50.
   - At the first blockage, they are vertically aligned at \( x = 50 \), 

---------------

200 feet apart vertically.

2. **Positions After Time \( t \)**:
   - Jenny's position: \( (50 - t, 0) \)
   - Kenny's position: \( (50 - 3t, 200) \)

3. **Line Equation and Distance**:
   - The line between \( (50 - t, 0) \) and \( (50 - 3t, 200) \) must be tangent to the building.
   - Slope \( m = \frac{200}{-2t} = -\frac{100}{t} \)
   - Line equation: \( y = -\frac{100}{t}(x - (50 - t)) \)
   - Standard form: \( 100x + ty - 5000 + 100t = 0 \)

4. **Distance from Center**:
   - Distance from \( (0, 100) \) to the line must be 50:
   \[
   \frac{|100 \cdot 0 + t \cdot 100 + 100t - 5000|}{\sqrt{100^2 + t^2}} = 50
   \]
   - Simplifying: \( \frac{|200t - 5000|}{\sqrt{10000 + t^2}} = 50 \)
   - Solving gives \( t = \frac{160}{3} \) seconds.

5. **Result**:
   - The time \( t \) is \( \frac{160}{3} \).
   - Sum of numerator and denominator: \( 160 + 3 = 163 \).

\boxed{163}<|im_end|>
