Okay, so I need to solve this problem about the operation * defined as a * b = ab - 5[ab/5], where [x] is the floor function, right? And the set A is {0,1,2,3,4}. We have a bijection f: A → A such that f(a * b) = f(a) * f(b). We need to find how many such bijections exist. Hmm, okay

---------------

.

First, let me make sure I understand the operation *. Let me compute some examples. Since it's defined as a*b = ab - 5 times the floor of (ab)/5. So for

---------------

 example, if a and b are numbers such that their product is less than 5, then floor(ab/5) would be 0, so a*b is just ab. If their product is 5 or more, then we subtract 5 times the integer part. So

---------------

 for example, 3*2 would be 6 - 5*(6/5 floored to 1) = 6 - 5 = 1? Wait, 3*2 =

---------------

 6, then 6 divided by 5 is 1.2, so floor(1.2) is 1, so 5*1 =5. Then 6-5=1. So

---------------

 yeah, 3*2=1. Similarly, 4*4 would be 16 - 5*(16/5)=16 - 5*3=16-15=1. Wait

---------------

, 16/5 is 3.2, so floor is 3. So 16 - 15 =1. Okay

---------------

, so that operation is like multiplying and then taking modulo 5, but not exactly. Wait, actually, let's see: since

---------------

 a*b mod 5 is equal to ab -5*floor(ab/5), right? Because mod 5 is the remainder when divided by 5. So actually

---------------

, this operation * is equivalent to multiplication modulo 5. Because ab mod 5 is exactly ab -5*floor(ab/5). Therefore, the operation * is just multiplication modulo 5. Wait

---------------

, so a * b ≡ ab mod5. So the operation is multiplication modulo 5. But since the set A is {0,1,2,3,4}, which are exactly the residues mod5. So this

---------------

 operation * is just multiplication mod5.

But hold on, the problem says the operation is a * b = ab -5[ab/5], so that

---------------

's exactly the same as ab mod5. Therefore, the operation * is multiplication modulo 5. Therefore, the structure (A, *) is the multiplicative semigroup modulo 5. Wait

---------------

, but actually, since 0 is included here, so it's a monoid? Or is it a group? Well

---------------

, since 0 multiplied by anything is 0, so it's not a group. Hmm. Anyway, the problem is about finding bijections f: A→A such that f(a * b) = f(a) * f(b). So f is

---------------

 a multiplicative homomorphism with respect to this operation, and since it's a bijection, it's an automorphism.



---------------

Therefore, the question reduces to finding the number of multiplicative automorphisms of the monoid (A, *). Since A is finite

---------------

, we can think of it as permutations of the elements that preserve multiplication modulo 5. Wait, but since f is a bijection, it

---------------

's a permutation of A, and we need that f(a*b) = f(a)*f(b). So it's a multiplicative automorphism. 



---------------

First, let's note that in the multiplicative monoid modulo 5, the elements are 0,1,2,3,4. The multiplicative structure is

---------------

 such that 0 times anything is 0, and the units are the numbers coprime to 5, which are 1,2,3,4. Since

---------------

 1,2,3,4 are invertible modulo 5. Specifically, 1 is the identity element for multiplication. The

---------------

 units form the multiplicative group modulo 5, which is cyclic of order 4. The elements 0 is the absorbing element.

Therefore, any

---------------

 automorphism f must preserve the multiplicative structure. Since automorphisms must preserve the absorbing element 0. Because if we consider

---------------

 f(0 * a) = f(0) * f(a). But 0 * a =0, so f(0) = f(0)*f(a). Since f is a bijection, f(a) can be any element,

---------------

 but f(0) must satisfy f(0) = f(0) * f(a) for all a. Let's see:

---------------

 Let me check that.

Suppose f(0) is mapped to some element x in A. Then for any a in A, f(0 * a) = f(0) * f(a). But 0*a =0, so left side is f(0). The right side is x * f(a). Therefore

---------------

, f(0) = x * f(a) for all a. Since f is a bijection, f(a) can be any element of

---------------

 A as a varies. Let's pick a such that f(a)=1 (since f is surjective, there exists such an a). Then f

---------------

(0) = x *1 =x*1 mod5. Since x *1 mod5 is just x. Therefore

---------------

, f(0) = x. But also, if we take another element, say, a where f(a)=0, but wait, f

---------------

 is a bijection, so 0 is in the codomain, so f must map some element to 0. Let me see.

---------------

 Wait, actually, since f is a bijection, the pre-image of 0 is exactly one element. Let me see

---------------

.

Wait, perhaps I need to think again. Let me suppose that f(0) must be 0. Suppose not

---------------

, suppose f(0) = x ≠ 0. Then for any a, f(0) = x * f(a). But

---------------

 since f is a bijection, f(a) can be any element of A as a varies. Therefore, x * f(a) must equal x for all a. But

---------------

 since f(a) can be any element, then x must satisfy x * y =x for any y in A. Let's see what

---------------

 x could be. Let me see:

Suppose x * y =x for all y in A. Let's see for

---------------

 each possible x:

If x=0: 0*y=0 for all y, so that would satisfy 0*y=0.

---------------

 So if x=0, then yes. But we supposed x ≠0.

If x=1: Then 1*y mod

---------------

5 must equal 1 for all y. But 1*2=2 mod5, which is not 1. So that's not possible.

x=2: 2*y mod5 must

---------------

 equal 2 for all y. Let's check y=3: 2*3=6 mod5=1≠2. Nope.

x=3: Similarly 3*2=6 mod5=1≠3.

x=4: 4*2=8 mod5=3≠4.

Therefore, only x=0 satisfies x*y =x for all y. Therefore, the

---------------

 only possible x is 0. Therefore, f(0) must be 0. So 0 must map to itself. Therefore, the

---------------

 bijection must fix 0. So that's a necessary condition.

Therefore, f(0)=0. So the autom

---------------

orphism must fix 0, and permute the other elements {1,2,3,4} in such a way that the multiplication is preserved. Since

---------------

 the multiplicative structure on {1,2,3,4} is the multiplicative group modulo 5, which is cyclic of order 4. The

---------------

 automorphisms of the multiplicative group modulo 5 (which is isomorphic to Z/4Z) are the group automorphisms of Z/4Z, which are the multiplication

---------------

 by units modulo 4. Since Aut(Z/4Z) is isomorphic to Z/2Z, because the automorphisms are determined

---------------

 by where they send the generator. The automorphisms are the maps x ↦ x and x ↦ 3x (since 3 is the only other unit mod4). Therefore

---------------

, there are 2 automorphisms of the multiplicative group modulo5.

However, since we are considering permutations of the set {1,2,3,4} that preserve multiplication, we

---------------

 need to see how these automorphisms correspond to permutations. Let me think step by step.

First, the multiplicative group mod5 is cyclic of order 4. Its elements are 1,2,3,4. Let's note that 2 is a generator since 2^1=2, 2^2=4, 2^3=3, 2^4=1 mod5. Similarly, 3 is also a generator since 3^1=3, 3^2=9≡4, 3^3=12≡2, 3^4=6≡1 mod5. So

---------------

 both 2 and 3 generate the group. 4 is 2^2, and 1 is the identity.

An automorphism of the group must send generators to generators. The generators are 2, 3. So

---------------

 the automorphism group is of order 2, as I thought earlier. The automorphisms can be either the identity automorphism (sending each element to itself), or the inverse automorphism, which sends

---------------

 each element to its inverse. Since in a cyclic group of order 4, the inverse of a generator is its cube.

---------------

 Since 2^{-1} mod5 is 3, since 2*3=6≡1. Similarly, 3^{-1}=2, and 4^{-1}=4 (since 4*4=16≡1 mod5). So

---------------

 the inverse automorphism would send 2→3, 3→2, 4→4, and 1→1. Wait, but 4 is its own inverse. So

---------------

 the inverse automorphism would fix 1 and 4, swap 2 and 3. Alternatively, since the automorphism group is of

---------------

 order 2, there are two automorphisms: identity and inversion.

Wait, but in the multiplicative group, inversion is an automorphism only

---------------

 if the group is abelian, which it is. So inversion is indeed an automorphism here. Therefore, the automorphism group has two elements: identity and inversion.

However, when considering permutations of {1,2,3,4}, there

---------------

 might be more possibilities? Wait, but the automorphisms must preserve multiplication. So any permutation that preserves the group operation must be an automorphism of the group. Since the automorphism group of the cyclic group of order 4 is of order 2, there

---------------

 are only two group automorphisms, so the permutations corresponding to these automorphisms would be the only ones that preserve multiplication.

---------------

 Therefore, the permutations would be either the identity permutation or the permutation swapping 2 and 3 and keeping 1 and 4 fixed. Wait

---------------

, but inversion also sends 4 to itself, right? Since 4 is self-inverse. So inversion would map 2↔

---------------

3 and leave 1 and 4 fixed. Therefore, the nontrivial automorphism is swapping 2 and 3, keeping 1 and 4 fixed.

But

---------------

 wait, are there other permutations that preserve multiplication? Let me check.

Suppose we consider another permutation, like swapping 1 and 2, but that

---------------

 might not preserve multiplication. Let me see.

Suppose f is a permutation that sends 1→2, 2→1, 3→3, 4→4. Let's check if this preserves multiplication. Let's see

---------------

, for example, compute f(1*2)=f(2)=1. On the other hand, f(1)*f(2)=2*1=2 mod5=2. But 1≠2, so that doesn't work. So that permutation doesn

---------------

't work. So that's not an automorphism.

Alternatively, suppose we swap 1 and 4? Let's see. Let

---------------

 f(1)=4, f(4)=1, and leave others fixed. Then check f(1*1)=f(1)=4. On the other hand, f(1)*f(1)=4*4=16 mod5=1. But 4≠1, so that's bad. So that permutation

---------------

 won't work.

Alternatively, maybe another permutation? Let's see, suppose we send 2→2, 3→3, but swap

---------------

 1 and 4? Wait, same problem as above.

Alternatively, what about sending 2→4? Let's see, if

---------------

 we try to define a permutation that maps 2→4, then since 2 is a generator, 4 is 2^2, so if

---------------

 we map 2 to 4, then 4 would map to 4^2=16 mod5=1, then 1 maps to 1^2=1, but

---------------

 that might not be a permutation. Wait, perhaps this approach is getting too convoluted.

Alternatively, maybe the only automorphisms are the two we

---------------

 thought: identity and inversion. Let me confirm that.

Let me see: since the multiplicative group mod5 is cyclic of order 4, its automorphism group is isomorphic to Z/2Z. So

---------------

 there are only two automorphisms: identity and inversion. Therefore, the only permutations of {1,2,3,4} that preserve multiplication are the identity permutation and the inversion permutation (which swaps 2 and 3 and leaves 1 and 4 fixed). Wait

---------------

, but inversion maps each element to its inverse. Let's check:

In the multiplicative group mod5:

- The inverse of 1 is 1.

- The inverse of 2 is 3, because 2×3=6≡1 mod5.

- The inverse of 3 is 2, similarly.

- The inverse of 4 is 4, since 4×4=16≡1 mod5.

Therefore, the inversion automorphism is

---------------

 the permutation that swaps 2 and 3, and leaves 1 and 4 fixed. So that is one nontrivial automorphism. Therefore

---------------

, the automorphism group has two elements: the identity and this swap. Therefore, the number of automorphisms would be 2.

But wait, the

---------------

 problem says that f is a bijection from A to A (so a permutation of A), with f(a*b)=f(a)*f(b). Since we already concluded

---------------

 that f must fix 0, the rest of the permutation on {1,2,3,4} must be an automorphism of the multiplicative group mod5. Since

---------------

 there are two such automorphisms, then the total number of such bijections f is 2?

Wait, but let

---------------

 me check again. Maybe there's something I'm missing here.

Alternatively, maybe there are more automorphisms when considering the entire monoid (

---------------

including 0)? Because the problem is about the monoid (A, *), not just the group of units. So

---------------

 perhaps the automorphisms can do more?

Wait, in the monoid, the element 0 is absorbing: 0*a =0 for any a, and similarly a*0=0. So any automorphism must preserve this property. Since we already saw

---------------

 that f(0) must be 0, so 0 is fixed. Then the rest of the elements {1,2,3,4} form a multiplicative monoid without

---------------

 0, but actually, the multiplicative structure there is the group. Because in the monoid, the elements {1,2,3,4} form a group under multiplication mod5. So the automorphisms of the monoid would

---------------

 be the same as the automorphisms of the group, since the 0 is fixed. Therefore, the automorphisms of the monoid are exactly

---------------

 the automorphisms of the group on the non-zero elements, so that would still be two automorphisms. So then

---------------

 the total number is 2?

But let me think again. Maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, let me think

---------------

 of possible permutations. Suppose f is an automorphism. Since f(0)=0, we can focus on permutations of {1,2,3,4}. Let me consider

---------------

 what conditions must hold for a permutation of {1,2,3,4} to be an automorphism.

For f

---------------

 to be an automorphism, for all a,b in A, f(a*b)=f(a)*f(b). Since 0 is fixed, and

---------------

 for non-zero elements, their products are also non-zero (except when one of them is 0, but since we are considering

---------------

 permutations of non-zero elements, we can focus on products within the group). So the permutation must preserve the group multiplication. Therefore

---------------

, the automorphisms are exactly the group automorphisms, so indeed two. Therefore, the answer should be 2?

Wait, but maybe

---------------

 there are more automorphisms when considering the monoid structure? Let me see.

Suppose I consider the permutation that swaps 1 and 4, and swaps 2 and 3. Let's see if that works.

Let f(1)=4, f(4)=1, f(2)=3, f(3)=2. Let's check if this preserves multiplication.

Take

---------------

 2*3 = 1 mod5. Then f(2*3) = f(1) =4. On the other hand, f(2)*f(3)=3*2=6 mod5=1. Wait, 4 vs 1. Not equal. So that doesn't work. So that permutation isn't an automorphism.

Alternatively

---------------

, suppose we have permutation that maps 1→1, 2→3, 3→2, 4→4, which is the inversion automorphism. Let's check 

---------------

2*3=1. Then f(2*3)=f(1)=1. f(2)*f(3)=3*2=6 mod5=1. That works. Similarly

---------------

, 2*2=4. f(2*2)=f(4)=4. f(2)*f(2)=3*3=9 mod5=4. That works. Similarly, 3*3=9≡4, same

---------------

 as above. 2*4=8 mod5=3. f(2*4)=f(3)=2. f(2)*f(4)=3*4=12 mod5=2. That

---------------

 works. 3*4=12 mod5=2. f(3*4)=f(2)=3. Wait, f(3)*f(4)=2*4=8 mod5=3. That

---------------

 works. 4*4=1. f(4*4)=f(1)=1. f(4)*f(4)=4*4=16 mod5=1. That

---------------

 works. So this permutation works.

Another permutation: identity. That works obviously.

What about another permutation, like swapping 1 and 2, and

---------------

 3 and 4?

Let me try f(1)=2, f(2)=1, f(3)=4, f(4)=3. Let's check 

---------------

2*3=1 mod5. f(2*3)=f(1)=2. f(2)*f(3)=1*4=4 mod5. 2≠4, so that doesn't work. Not an automorphism.

Alternatively, swapping

---------------

 1 and 3? Let's try f(1)=3, f(3)=1, and keep others fixed. Let's see 

---------------

1*1=1. f(1*1)=f(1)=3. f(1)*f(1)=3*3=9≡4 mod5. 3 vs4.

---------------

 Not equal. So that's bad.

Hmm, so indeed only the inversion automorphism (swapping 2 and 3) and the identity seem

---------------

 to work. So that gives two automorphisms. But wait, let me think again. Let me check another possibility. Suppose we

---------------

 have a permutation that cycles 1→2→3→4→1? Let's see:

Let f(1)=2, f(2)=3, f(3)=4, f(4)=1. Let's test 

---------------

2*3=1. f(2*3)=f(1)=2. f(2)*f(3)=3*4=12 mod5=2. That works here. Next

---------------

, 2*2=4. f(2*2)=f(4)=1. f(2)*f(2)=3*3=9 mod5=4. 1 vs 4:

---------------

 Not equal. So that doesn't work. So that permutation is invalid.

Alternatively, another cycle? Let me see 1→3, 3→2, 2→4, 4→1? Let

---------------

 me try f(1)=3, f(3)=2, f(2)=4, f(4)=1. Check

---------------

 2*3=1: f(2*3)=f(1)=3. f(2)*f(3)=4*2=8 mod5=3. That works here. Now

---------------

 check 2*2=4: f(2*2)=f(4)=1. f(2)*f(2)=4*4=16 mod5=1. That works. 

---------------

3*3=4: f(3*3)=f(4)=1. f(3)*f(3)=2*2=4 mod5=4. 1 vs4: Not equal. So that fails. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 a different permutation? Let me think of another possible automorphism.

Suppose f(1)=1, f(2)=4, f(4)=2, f(3)=3. Let's see:



---------------

Check 2*2=4. f(2*2)=f(4)=2. f(2)*f(2)=4*4=16 mod5=1. 2 vs1: Not equal. So

---------------

 that's bad.

Hmm. Maybe there are only two automorphisms. So that would mean the total number is 2.

But wait, let

---------------

 me think again. The multiplicative group modulo 5 is cyclic of order 4. Its automorphism group is isomorphic to the group of units modulo 4, which is Z/2Z, since autom

---------------

orphisms of a cyclic group of order n are isomorphic to the multiplicative group modulo n. Wait, actually, Aut(Z/nZ) is isomorphic to Z/φ(n)Z when n is prime power? Wait, actually

---------------

, Aut(Z/nZ) is isomorphic to the multiplicative group (Z/nZ)^*, which for n=4 is {1,3} mod4, which has order 2. So yes

---------------

, so Aut(Z/4Z) has order 2, so indeed there are two automorphisms. Therefore, that

---------------

 would correspond to the two permutations we found: identity and inversion (swapping 2 and 3). Therefore, the answer is 2?

Wait, but hold

---------------

 on. Let me see. The automorphism group of the multiplicative group mod5 is indeed of order 2, so there

---------------

 are two automorphisms. Therefore, the number of such bijections f would be 2? But the problem says "bijection f: A→A", so since

---------------

 we have to fix 0, and permute the rest according to the automorphisms of the multiplicative group, so

---------------

 that would be two possibilities. Hence the answer is 2?

Wait, but maybe there's more. Let me think again

---------------

. Maybe the automorphism can also involve permuting elements in a way that's compatible with the operation, but not just the group automorphisms. Wait

---------------

, but since the non-zero elements form a group under multiplication mod5, and 0 is an absorbing element, then any automorphism must fix 0 and act

---------------

 as a group automorphism on the non-zero elements. Since the group automorphisms are only the two mentioned, then total

---------------

 automorphisms are two.

Alternatively, maybe there's an automorphism that maps 1 to some other element? Wait, but

---------------

 in the group automorphism, the generator can be mapped to any other generator. Since the generators of the multiplicative group mod5 are 2 and 3. So an automorphism can send 2 to 2 or 3, right

---------------

?

Wait, actually, in the automorphism group of a cyclic group of order 4, the automorphisms are determined by where they send a generator. Since the

---------------

 automorphism group is isomorphic to Z/2Z, there are two automorphisms: one that sends a generator to itself (identity) and one that sends it to its inverse (which would be the other generator). Since

---------------

 in this case, the generators are 2 and 3 (since 2^3=3 and 3^3=2). Therefore, the inversion automorphism sends 2→3 and 3→2, as

---------------

 we saw.

Alternatively, if you choose a different generator, say 3, then the automorphism could be sending 3→2 or

---------------

 3→3. So yes, the automorphism group is of order 2. Therefore, only two automorphisms. Therefore, the

---------------

 answer is 2.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think of all possible permutations of the non-zero elements and see which ones satisfy the homomorphism condition.

There

---------------

 are 4! =24 permutations of {1,2,3,4}. We need to find those permutations f where for all a,b in {1,2,3,4}, f(a*b mod5) = f(a)*f(b) mod5.

Alternatively

---------------

, since the operation is mod5, and f is a permutation, this must hold for all a,b. Let me see

---------------

.

Let me try to list all possible permutations that satisfy the condition.

First, the identity permutation obviously works.

Second, the inversion automorphism (

---------------

swapping 2 and 3, keeping 1 and 4 fixed) works, as we checked before.

Are there others?

Let me consider

---------------

 swapping 1 and 4. Let me see:

Define f(1)=4, f(4)=1, f(2)=2, f(3)=3. Let's check if

---------------

 this works.

Check 1*1=1. f(1*1)=f(1)=4. f(1)*f(1)=4*4=16 mod5=1. 4 vs 1: Not equal. So that's bad.

What

---------------

 if we swap 1 and 4 and also swap 2 and 3?

Define f(1)=4, f(4)=1, f(2)=3, f(3)=2. Let's check:



---------------

Check 1*1=1: f(1*1)=f(1)=4. f(1)*f(1)=4*4=1. 4 vs1: Not equal. Still bad.

Hmm.

How

---------------

 about the permutation f(1)=1, f(2)=3, f(3)=2, f(4)=4. That's the inversion automorphism,

---------------

 which works.

What about f(1)=1, f(2)=4, f(4)=2, f(3)=3.

---------------

 Let's check:

Check 2*2=4: f(2*2)=f(4)=2. f(2)*f(2)=4*4=1. 2 vs1: Not equal. Bad

---------------

.

Another idea: Let me see if mapping 2→2, 3→3, 4→4, and 1→1 is identity, which

---------------

 works. If we map 2→3, 3→2, 4→4, 1→1, that's inversion.

Is

---------------

 there a permutation where we map 2→4? Let's see:

Suppose f(2)=4. Then since 2 is a generator, we

---------------

 can see where the images go. Let me see:

Suppose f is defined by f(2)=4. Since in

---------------

 the group, 2 generates the group. Let's see what f(2^2)=f(4)=f(2)^2 mod5. So

---------------

 f(4)=4^2=16 mod5=1. So f(4)=1. Then f(2^3)=f(3)=f(2)^3=4^3=64 mod5=4. Wait, 4^3 is 64 mod5 is 64-12*5=64-60=4. So f(3)=4. But f

---------------

(2)=4 and f(3)=4 would not be injective. So that's a problem. Therefore, such

---------------

 a permutation can't be injective. Hence, that's invalid.

Alternatively, maybe f(2)=3. Then f(2^2)=f(4)=3^2=9 mod5=4. Then f(2^3)=f(3)=3^3=27 mod5=2. Then f(2^4)=f(1)=3^4=81 mod5=1. So that

---------------

 gives f(1)=1, f(2)=3, f(3)=2, f(4)=4. Which is exactly the inversion automorphism. So that works.

Alternatively, if we set

---------------

 f(2)=2, then f(2^2)=f(4)=4, f(2^3)=f(3)=8 mod5=3, so

---------------

 f(3)=3. Then f(1)=1. So that's the identity.

Therefore, only two possibilities here

---------------

.

Another permutation: Let's suppose f(1)=2, f(2)=1, f(3)=4, f(4)=3. Let me check:



---------------

Check 2*3=1. f(2*3)=f(1)=2. f(2)*f(3)=1*4=4. Not equal. Doesn't work.

Alternatively, f

---------------

(1)=3, f(3)=1, f(2)=2, f(4)=4. Check 1*1=1. f(1*1)=3. f(1)*f(1)=3*3=9 mod5=4. Not equal.

Hmm, so indeed

---------------

, only the two permutations work. Therefore, the total number of bijections f is 2?

Wait, but hold on. Let

---------------

 me think again. The problem says "bijection f: A→A" so the entire set A, which includes 0. Since f must fix 0, the rest

---------------

 must permute the non-zero elements as automorphisms. Since there are two automorphisms, the total number is 2. So

---------------

 the answer is 2?

Wait a second, but let me check another angle. Suppose we consider that in the monoid (A, *), the operation

---------------

 * is multiplication mod5. The automorphisms of this monoid are the permutations f of A such that f(a*b)=f(a)*f(b). Since 0 must map to 0, as

---------------

 we saw. The rest must form an automorphism of the multiplicative group on {1,2,3,4}. Since

---------------

 that group has automorphism group of order 2, so total automorphisms are 2. So the answer is 2.

---------------

 Therefore, the number of such bijections is 2?

Wait, but maybe there's another automorphism where we map 1 to something

---------------

 else? For instance, if we can shift the elements in some way?

Wait, in the multiplicative group, 1 is the identity element. So

---------------

 any group automorphism must send the identity to itself. Because automorphisms must preserve the identity. Since f(1 * a) = f(a) = f(1) * f(a) for any a. Therefore, f(1) must be the identity element in the codomain. Since f is a bijection, the identity must map to the identity. Therefore, f(1)=1. So 1 must be fixed. So that

---------------

's another necessary condition. So 1 must stay fixed. Therefore, the automorphism can't move 1. Therefore, the

---------------

 only possible permutations are those that fix 1 and 0, and permute the other elements in a way that preserves multiplication. Wait

---------------

, so if 1 must be fixed, then the automorphism group is indeed only the inversion automorphism (swapping 2 and 3, keeping 4 fixed)

---------------

 and the identity. So that gives two automorphisms. So yes, the answer is 2.

Wait, but hold

---------------

 on, let's confirm that 4 must also be fixed? Let me see. Since 4 is 2 squared, so if you have an automorphism, then

---------------

 f(2^2)=f(2)^2. Suppose we have the inversion automorphism, which sends 2→3, then f(4)=f(2^2)=f(2)^2=3^2=9≡4 mod5. So 4 is fixed. Similarly, if you have another

---------------

 automorphism, you can't send 4 anywhere else. Since 4 is the square of a generator, so it has to stay as

---------------

 the square. Since in the group, 4 is an element of order 2 (since 4^2=1). So any

---------------

 automorphism must map elements of order 2 to elements of order 2. The elements of order 2 in the group are 4 and... let

---------------

's see, 4 has order 2, since 4^2=1. The element 1 has order 1, 2 has order4, 3 has order4, 4 order2. So elements of order 2 is only 4. Therefore, automorphisms must fix 4. Therefore

---------------

, 4 must be fixed as well. Therefore, the only thing that can be swapped are 2 and 3. Therefore

---------------

, the only nontrivial automorphism is swapping 2 and 3, keeping 1 and 4 fixed. Therefore, only

---------------

 two automorphisms.

Therefore, the total number of such bijections f is 2.

Wait, but let me see

---------------

 if there is another automorphism where maybe 2→2, 3→3, and 4→4, but that's the identity. So

---------------

 yeah, only two.

Alternatively, perhaps I missed an automorphism where we have a different generator? But since the automorphism must fix 1 and 4, and swap

---------------

 2 and 3, I don't see another possibility. Therefore, the answer is 2?

Wait, but hold

---------------

 on a second. Let me think of the entire monoid structure. The operation * includes 0, so perhaps there's a

---------------

 different automorphism that involves 0 somehow? But since 0 must be fixed, and the rest are in the group, I

---------------

 don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps there are automorphisms where f(1)=1, f(2)=2, f(3)=3, f(4)=4,

---------------

 which is identity. The other is swapping 2 and3. So total two. Hence, the answer is 2.

Wait, but wait

---------------

. Let me check again the automorphism that swaps 2 and3. Let me verify all possible multiplications to be thorough.

Let

---------------

 me list all possible products in the group {1,2,3,4} and see if the permutation swapping 2↔3 preserves them.

First

---------------

, the permutation is f(1)=1, f(2)=3, f(3)=2, f(4)=4.

Check all pairs

---------------

:

1*1=1 ⇒ f(1)*f(1)=1*1=1. OK.

1*2=2 ⇒ f(1)*f(2)=1*3=3,

---------------

 and f(2)=3. OK.

1*3=3 ⇒ f(1)*f(3)=1*2=2, and f(3)=2. OK.

1*4=4 ⇒ f(1)*f(4)=1*4=4. OK.

2*1=2 ⇒ f

---------------

(2)*f(1)=3*1=3, which is f(2)=3. OK.

2*2=4 ⇒ f(2)*f(2)=3*3=9≡4 mod5. OK

---------------

.

2*3=1 ⇒ f(2)*f(3)=3*2=6≡1 mod5. OK.

2*4=8≡3 ⇒ f(2)*f(4)=3*4=12≡2 mod5. Wait, f

---------------

(2*4)=f(3)=2. And f(2)*f(4)=3*4=12 mod5=2. So

---------------

 that's okay.

3*1=3 ⇒ f(3)*f(1)=2*1=2, which is f(3)=2. Wait, f

---------------

(3*1)=f(3)=2. And f(3)*f(1)=2*1=2. So

---------------

 that's okay.

3*2=6≡1 ⇒ f(3)*f(2)=2*3=6≡1 mod5. Which

---------------

 matches f(3*2)=f(1)=1. Correct.

3*3=9≡4 ⇒ f(3)*f(3)=2*2=4. OK

---------------

.

3*4=12≡2 ⇒ f(3)*f(4)=2*4=8≡3 mod5. Wait, f(3*4)=f(2)=3. And

---------------

 f(3)*f(4)=2*4=8 mod5=3. So that's okay.

4*1=4 ⇒ f(4)*f(1)=4*1=4. OK.

4*2=8≡3 ⇒ f(4)*f(2)=4*3=12≡2 mod5. Wait, f(4*2)=f(3)=2. f

---------------

(4)*f(2)=12 mod5=2. That's okay.

4*3=12≡2 ⇒ f(4)*f(3)=4*2=8≡3 mod5. f(4*3)=f(2)=3. Which

---------------

 matches.

4*4=16≡1 ⇒ f(4)*f(4)=4*4=16≡1 mod5. OK.

So

---------------

 yes, all products check out. So this permutation works.

Therefore, indeed, only two such bijections: identity and swapping 2 and3.

Therefore, the answer should be 2?

Wait, but hold

---------------

 on, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me see. The problem says "bijection f: A→A",

---------------

 so we have to consider all permutations that fix 0 and act as automorphisms on the rest. Since the automorphisms on the multiplicative group are only

---------------

 two, so total is two.

Alternatively, perhaps there is another automorphism where we also swap 4 with something? But earlier

---------------

 analysis shows that 4 must be fixed because it's the only element of order 2, so automorphisms must fix it. Therefore

---------------

, no.

Alternatively, maybe there is an automorphism that cyclically permutes 2→3→4→2? Wait, but let

---------------

's test that.

Suppose f(2)=3, f(3)=4, f(4)=2, and f(1)=1. Let's check:



---------------

First, 2*2=4. f(2*2)=f(4)=2. f(2)*f(2)=3*3=9≡4 mod5. So 2 vs4: Not equal. Doesn

---------------

't work.

Alternatively, maybe 2→4, 4→3, 3→2? Then f(2)=4, f(4)=3, f(3)=2, f(1)=1.

Check 2*2=4. f(2*2)=f(4)=3. f(2)*f(2)=4*4=1 mod5. 3 vs1: Not equal.

Hmm, no.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps another approach. Since the automorphism group of the multiplicative group is size 2, so the answer is 2. Therefore

---------------

, the answer should be 2.

But wait, the problem says "bijection f: A→A", so maybe

---------------

 the automorphism group includes more elements when considering the monoid structure? Let me think of the monoid (A, *). The monoid has 0 as

---------------

 absorbing element, and the rest form a group. The automorphisms of the monoid must fix 0 and be automorphisms of the group. Since

---------------

 the group automorphisms are two, so the total automorphisms are two. Therefore, the answer is 2.

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps the automorphism can also map 1 to another element? Wait, but 1 is the multiplicative identity. Since

---------------

 in any monoid automorphism, the identity must map to itself. Because for any a in A, f(1 * a) = f(a) must equal f(1) * f(a). Therefore

---------------

, f(1) must be the identity element in the codomain. Since f is a bijection, the identity element must map to the identity. Therefore, f(1)=1.

Therefore, indeed

---------------

, the only automorphisms are those that fix 0,1,4 and swap 2 and 3, or do nothing. So two

---------------

 automorphisms.

Therefore, the answer is 2.

Wait, but hold on. Let me think of another possibility. Suppose

---------------

 we have a permutation that maps 1→1, 2→2, 3→3, 4→4. That's the identity.

Another permutation

---------------

: 1→1, 2↔3, 4→4. That's the inversion automorphism.

But are

---------------

 there any other permutations where maybe 4 is involved differently?

Wait, since 4 is its own inverse and has order 2, but

---------------

 it's also 2 squared. So any automorphism must preserve that. Therefore, if you have an automorphism, it

---------------

 must send 4 to itself, because it's the only element of order 2. Since in the group, the element of order 2 must map to an element of order 2. Since there

---------------

's only one such element, 4 must be fixed.

Therefore, yes, only two automorphisms.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 there is an automorphism that's more complicated, but I can't think of any. Let me try one more permutation.



---------------

Suppose f(1)=1, f(2)=2, f(3)=4, f(4)=3. Let me check.



---------------

Check 3*3=4 mod5. f(3*3)=f(4)=3. f(3)*f(3)=4*4=1 mod5. 3 vs1: Not equal. So

---------------

 that's bad.

Alternatively, f(3)=3, f(4)=4. That's identity.

Alternatively, f(2)=3, f(3)=2, f(4)=4. That's the inversion.



---------------

Therefore, I can't find any other permutations that work. So I think it's two. So the answer is 2. Therefore

---------------

, I think the answer is 2. But let me check once more.

Wait, actually, hold on a second. The

---------------

 problem says "bijection f:A→A" such that f(a*b)=f(a)*f(b). Since the operation * is multiplication mod5. So

---------------

 the question is essentially asking for the number of monoid automorphisms of the monoid (A, *), where A is {0,1,2,3,4}. The

---------------

 monoid automorphisms must fix 0 and act as automorphisms on the group {1,2,3,4}. Since that group's automorphism group is of order 2, so total

---------------

 automorphisms are 2. Therefore, the answer is 2. So I think that's it.

But wait, the

---------------

 problem might have a different answer. Let me think again. Maybe I missed something. Wait, let me think of the multip

---------------

licative structure.

Wait, in the monoid, the operation is multiplication mod5. The automorphism must preserve this. So

---------------

 for example, the permutation that swaps 2 and 3, and leaves 1 and4 fixed is an automorphism. The

---------------

 identity is another. So two.

Alternatively, maybe there is an automorphism that maps 2→2, 3→3, 4→4, but that

---------------

's identity.

Alternatively, is there a way to have an automorphism that maps 1 to another element? No, because 1 is the identity,

---------------

 so must stay fixed.

Alternatively, maybe 4 can be moved? But 4 is the only element of order 2, so must stay fixed.

Alternatively

---------------

, is there a different automorphism where the permutation is more complex but still satisfies the conditions? I can't find any.

Wait

---------------

, let me think of another angle. Let's list all possible permutations of {1,2,3,4} that fix 1 and 4, and swap 2 and3, or

---------------

 do nothing. That's two permutations. Any other permutation that fixes 1 and4 must either swap 2 and3 or do

---------------

 nothing. But if it fixes 2 and3, then it's identity. If it swaps them, that's the other autom

---------------

orphism. So indeed only two.

Alternatively, if a permutation fixes 1 and4 but does something else with 2 and3, like cyclic

---------------

 shifts? Like 2→3→4→2? But since 4 is fixed, that can't happen. Because

---------------

 4 must stay fixed. So no.

Alternatively, 2→4, but then where does 4 go? It has to stay at

---------------

4. So can't.

Alternatively, maybe 2→2, 3→4, but then 3 maps to4, which is fixed. Let's see if

---------------

 that works:

Suppose f(2)=2, f(3)=4, f(4)=4. But then f is

---------------

 not a bijection because 4 is mapped to by both 3 and4. Not injective.

Hmm.

Alternatively, f

---------------

(3)=4 and f(4)=3. But then f(4)=3. Then check f(3*3)=f(4)=3. But f(3)*f(3)=4*4=1 mod5. 3 vs1. Not equal.

Therefore

---------------

, that doesn't work.

Therefore, indeed only two permutations.

Therefore, the answer must be 2.

Wait, but the

---------------

 problem says "bijection f:A→A", so the total number is 2? But maybe I'm missing something here

---------------

. Wait, perhaps the automorphism group of the monoid is larger?

Wait, let me think of another permutation where f(0)=0, f(1)=1, f(2)=4, f(4)=2, f(3)=3.

Wait, let's check

---------------

 this permutation:

f(2)=4, f(4)=2, f(3)=3, f(1)=1.

Check some products:

2*2=4 ⇒ f(2*2)=f(4)=2. f(2)*f(2)=4*4=1 mod5. 2 vs1. Not equal. So that

---------------

's bad.

Hmm.

Alternatively, f(2)=3, f(3)=4, f(4)=2. Wait

---------------

, but then f(4)=2, so f(2)=3, f(3)=4, f(4)=2. Let's see if this works:

Check 2*2=4 ⇒ f(2*2)=f(4)=2. f(2)*f(2)=3*3=9 mod5=4. 2 vs4: Not equal. Nope

---------------

.

Alternatively, f(2)=3, f(3)=2, f(4)=4. That's the inversion automorphism,

---------------

 which works.

Alternatively, f(2)=2, f(3)=3, f(4)=4. Identity.

Hmm

---------------

.

Alternatively, maybe there's an automorphism that cycles 2→3→4→2, but as before, that

---------------

 doesn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps the automorphism group is actually of order 4? Wait, how?

Wait, let

---------------

 me think of the multiplicative monoid structure. The monoid is {0,1,2,3,4} with multiplication mod5. The automorphism group must

---------------

 fix 0 and 1. Wait, no, 1 must be fixed because it's the identity. 0 is fixed.

---------------

 Then, the other elements form a group, so automorphisms are group automorphisms. The group is cyclic of order4, so automorphism group order

---------------

2. So total automorphisms of the monoid are 2. So answer is 2. Therefore, I think that

---------------

's correct.

Wait, but let me check an example of another permutation that might work. Let me suppose f(1)=1, f(2)=2, f(3)=3, f(4)=4. That's identity.

Another one

---------------

 is f(1)=1, f(2)=3, f(3)=2, f(4)=4. That works.

Is

---------------

 there a third one? Let me see:

Suppose f(1)=1, f(2)=4, f(4)=2, f(3)=3. Let

---------------

 me check if this works.

Check 2*2=4 ⇒ f(2*2)=f(4)=2. f(2)*f(2)=4*4=1 mod5. 2 vs1: Not equal. So no.

Alternatively

---------------

, f(1)=1, f(2)=3, f(3)=4, f(4)=2. Let's see:

Check 2*2=4 ⇒ f(2*2)=f(4)=2. f(2)*f(2)=3*3=9≡4 mod5. 2 vs4: Not equal.

Hmm.

Alternatively, f(2)=2, f(3)=4, f(4)=3. Let

---------------

 me see:

Check 3*3=4 ⇒ f(3*3)=f(4)=3. f(3)*f(3)=4*4=1 mod5. 3 vs1: Not equal.

Hmm

---------------

. So it's not working.

Alternatively, f(2)=4, f(3)=2, f(4)=3. Check:

2*3=1 ⇒ f(2*3)=f(1)=1. f(2)*f(3)=4*2=8≡3 mod5. Not equal.

Therefore

---------------

, no.

Alright, so after checking all possibilities, it seems only two permutations work. Therefore, the answer is 2. So

---------------

 the number of such bijections is 2.

Wait, but the problem is from a competition, maybe the answer is different? Let

---------------

 me think again. Wait, maybe I missed that the automorphism group of the monoid is larger because the monoid includes

---------------

 0?

Wait, in the monoid, the operation is multiplication mod5. The monoid's automorphism must preserve the

---------------

 operation. Since 0 is absorbing, so f(0)=0. The rest must form a group automorphism. The

---------------

 group automorphism group is order 2, so total automorphisms are 2. So answer is 2. So

---------------

 I think I'm confident now.

But wait, let me check the problem statement again. It says "双射 f:A→A 满足 f(a∗b)=f(a)∗f(b)". So the

---------------

 problem is exactly as I thought. So I think the answer is 2.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in assuming

---------------

 that the automorphism must preserve the group structure on the non-zero elements. Let me think: the condition f(a*b) = f(a)*f(b) must hold for all a,b in A, including when one of them is 0. But

---------------

 since f(0)=0 and 0*a=0, so f(0*a)=0 =0 *f(a)=0. So that holds. So

---------------

 the only constraints are on the non-zero elements. Therefore, the automorphism group is indeed the automorphism group of the multiplicative group,

---------------

 which is 2.

Therefore, the final answer is 2. So I think that's correct.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{2}


The operation \( a \ast b = ab - 5 \left\lfloor \frac{ab}{5} \right\rfloor \) is equivalent to multiplication modulo 5. The set \( A = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\} \) forms a monoid under this operation, where 0 is the absorbing element, and the non-zero elements \(\{1, 2, 3, 4\}\) form a multiplicative group modulo 5, which is cyclic of order 4.

To find the number of bijections \( f: A \to A \) such that \( f(a \ast b) = f(a) \ast f(b) \), we note that \(

---------------

 f \) must fix 0 because \( f(0) \) must satisfy \( f(0) = f(0) \ast f(a) \) for all \( a \in A \). Therefore, \( f(0) = 0 \).

The remaining elements \(\{1, 2, 3, 4\}\) form a multiplicative group modulo 5. The automorphisms of this group are determined by the

---------------

 automorphism group of the cyclic group of order 4, which is isomorphic to \( \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \). This group has two automorphisms: the identity automorphism and the inversion automorphism (which swaps 2 and 3 while fixing 1 and 4).

Thus, the bij

---------------

ections \( f \) that satisfy the given conditions are:
1. The identity permutation.
2. The permutation that swaps 2 and 3 while fixing 0, 1, and 4.

Therefore, the number of such bijections is \(\boxed{2}\).<|im_end|>
