Okay, let's see. I have this problem with logarithms and three variables u, v, w, all positive real numbers not equal to 1. The equations given are:

First equation: log base u of v times w plus log base v of w equals 5. Wait, hold on, the problem

---------------

 says "log _{u} v w". Hmm, maybe I need to parse that correctly. Is it log_u(vw) or log_u(v) times w? The notation might be ambiguous. But in

---------------

 Chinese math problems, usually when they write log_{u} v w, it might be log base u of (v*w). Alternatively, maybe it's log_u(v) multiplied by w? Hmm, but the

---------------

 second term is log_v w, which is standard notation. Let me check the problem again.

Original problem: "log _{u} v w + log _{v} w =5". The

---------------

 first term could be log_u(v) * w or log_u(v*w). Since the second term is log_v(w), probably

---------------

 the first term is log_u(vw). So the first equation is log_u(vw) + log_v(w) =5. Similarly

---------------

 the second equation is log_v(u) + log_w(v) =3. Then we need to find log_w(u).

Alternatively, maybe the first term is log_u(v) multiplied by w? But that would be written as w * log_u(v), but

---------------

 the problem didn't have a multiplication sign. So probably the first term is log base u of (v*w). Let me proceed with that assumption first.

So, let me denote

---------------

 the logs with variables to make it easier. Let me set:

Let a = log_u(v). Then, by change of base formula, that's ln v / ln u.

Similarly, let b = log_v(w) = ln w / ln v.

And

---------------

 let c = log_w(u) = ln u / ln w.

Our goal is to find c.

Also, note that log_u(vw) can be written using logarithm properties as log_u(v) + log_u(w). So that would

---------------

 be a + log_u(w). But log_u(w) is equal to (ln w)/(ln u) = (ln w / ln v) * (ln v / ln u) ) = b * a. Wait, no

---------------

. Wait, log_u(w) is (ln w)/(ln u). Since log_v(w) is b = (ln w)/(ln v), so (ln w) = b * ln v. Then, log_u(w) = (b * ln v)/(ln u) = b * (ln v / ln u) ) = b * a. Because

---------------

 a is log_u(v) = (ln v)/(ln u). Therefore, log_u(w) = b * a. Therefore, log_u(vw) = log_u(v) + log_u(w) = a + a*b.

Therefore, the first equation is log_u(vw) + log_v(w) = (a + a*b) + b = a(1 + b) + b =5.

Second

---------------

 equation: log_v(u) + log_w(v) = ?

log_v(u) is the reciprocal of log_u(v), so that's 1/a.

Similarly, log_w(v) is reciprocal of log_v(w), so that's 1/b.

Therefore, the second equation is (1/a) + (1/b) =3.

So now, we have two equations:

1) a(1 + b) + b =5

2) 1/a + 1/b =3

We need to find c = log_w(u) = ?

But how

---------------

 is c related to a and b?

Since c = log_w(u) = (ln u)/(ln w). Let's express this

---------------

 in terms of a and b.

We know that log_u(v) = a = (ln v)/(ln u) → ln v = a ln u.

log_v(w) = b = (ln w)/(ln v) → ln w = b ln v = b a ln u.

Therefore, ln w = a b ln u → ln

---------------

 u / ln w = 1/(a b). Therefore, c = log_w(u) = 1/(a b).

Therefore, if

---------------

 we can find a*b, then c is just 1/(a b). So our target is to find 1/(a b). So

---------------

 if we can find the value of a*b, then we can get c.

So now, let's see. Let me denote

---------------

 equation 1 and equation 2 again:

Equation1: a(1 + b) + b =5 → a + a b + b =5 → a + b + a b =5

Equation2: 1/a +1/b =3 → (b + a)/ (a b) =3 → a + b = 3 a b.

So from

---------------

 equation 2, a + b = 3 a b. Let me substitute this into equation1.

Equation1 becomes: (3 a b) + a b =5 → 4 a b =5 → a b =5/4.

Therefore, c =1/(a b)= 4/5. Wait, but that

---------------

 seems too straightforward? Let me check again.

Wait, let's go step by step.

Equation1: a + b + a b =5.

Equation2: a + b =3 a b.

Substitute equation2 into equation1:

Left side becomes (3 a b) + a b =4 a b =5 ⇒ a b =5/4.

Therefore, c=1/(a b)=4/5. So

---------------

 log_w u is 4/5, so m=4, n=5, so m +n=9.



---------------

Wait, but let me check again if all steps are correct.

First, let me confirm the equations.

Starting with equation1: log_u(vw) + log_v(w) =5.

log

---------------

_u(vw)= log_u v + log_u w = a + log_u w.

log_u w = (ln w)/(ln u). Since log_v w = b = (ln w)/(ln v), so ln w =b ln v. Also

---------------

, ln v = a ln u from log_u v =a. Therefore, ln w= b a ln u. Therefore

---------------

, log_u w = (b a ln u)/ (ln u)=ab. So log_u(vw)=a +ab.

Then

---------------

 log_v w is just b. So equation1 is (a +ab) + b= a +ab +b =5, which is correct

---------------

.

Equation2: log_v u + log_w v =3.

log_v u is 1/a, log_w v is 1/b. So 1/a +1/b =3, which is correct.

Then substit

---------------

uting equation2 into equation1:

a + b +ab =5, and since a + b =3ab, then

---------------

 3ab +ab=4ab=5 ⇒ab=5/4. Thus c=1/(ab)=4/5. So the

---------------

 answer is 4/5, so m +n=9.

Hmm, but wait, is there a possibility that I made a mistake in interpreting the first logarithm?

Let

---------------

 me re-examine the problem statement again.

The problem says: "log _{u} v w + log _{v} w=5".

If instead of log_u(vw), it was log_u(v) multiplied by w, then the first term would be w * log_u(v). But that

---------------

 would be written differently, perhaps with parentheses. Since it's written as log_u v w, maybe it's log base u of v, multiplied by w? But that would be written

---------------

 as w * log_u v, but the problem didn't have a multiplication symbol. So probably the first term is log_u(vw). So

---------------

 my initial interpretation is correct.

Alternatively, maybe log_u(v) + log_w something? But the problem is written as "log _{u} v w".

---------------

 Maybe the problem has a typo or different grouping? Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe it's log_u(v) + log_w(...)

---------------

 but the problem is written as log_u v w. Hmm, maybe the original Chinese problem uses different notation. Alternatively, perhaps it

---------------

's log_u(v) * log_w(...). Hmm, but without more context, I think my first interpretation is the most plausible.

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 the first term is log base u of v, multiplied by log base v of w? But that would be written as (log_u v)(log_v w), but the problem writes

---------------

 it as log_u v w + log_v w=5. Hmm, the second term is log_v w, so the

---------------

 first term must be similar, perhaps log_u(vw). Since the second term is log_v(w). So the first term is log_u(vw). So

---------------

 I think my initial steps are okay.

Therefore, the answer is 4/5, so m +n=4+5=9. Therefore

---------------

, I think that is correct.

Wait, but let me try plugging in numbers to check.

Suppose that log_w u =4/5, so c

---------------

=4/5. Then a*b=5/4.

Suppose, for example, let me pick some numbers. Let me choose

---------------

 u, v, w such that the conditions are satisfied.

Suppose let’s set a = log_u(v) =1

---------------

, then from equation2: a + b =3ab. If a=1, then 1 + b =3b ⇒1=2b ⇒b=1/2. Then ab=1*(1/2)=1/2, but we need ab=5/4. So that doesn

---------------

't work.

Alternatively, let me pick a=5/4, then let's see.

Wait, perhaps pick variables so that ab=5/4. Let me set

---------------

 a=5/2 and b=1. Then ab=5/2*1=5/2 which is not 5/4. Hmm.

Alternatively, let me suppose

---------------

 a=5 and b=1/4. Then ab=5*(1/4)=5/4. Then check equation2: a +b =5 +1/4=21/4. 3ab=3*(5/4)=15/4. 21/4 vs

---------------

 15/4. Not equal. So that's not good.

Hmm, so maybe need to solve for a and b.



---------------

We have two equations:

1) a + b +ab =5,

2) a + b =3ab.

Let me denote

---------------

 equation2: a +b =3ab. Let me substitute into equation1:

Equation1: (3ab) +ab =4ab =5 ⇒ab=5/4.

So

---------------

, with ab=5/4, then from equation2: a +b=3*(5/4)=15/4.

So,

---------------

 a +b=15/4 and ab=5/4.

Therefore, a and b are roots of the quadratic equation x² - (15/4)x +5/4=0.

Multiply by 4: 4x² -15x +5=0.

Solutions: x=(15 ±√(225 -80))/8=(15±√145)/8.

Hmm, irrational

---------------

 numbers. But since the problem doesn’t require specific values of a and b, but just the product ab which is 5/4, so c=4/5. So that

---------------

 should be okay.

Therefore, the answer is 4/5, so m +n=9.

I think that's correct.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{9}


Given the equations involving logarithms with bases \(u\), \(v\), and \(w\):

1. \(\log_{u}(vw) + \log_{v}w = 5\)
2. \(\log_{v}u + \log_{w}v = 3\)

We need to find the value of \(\log_{w}u\) and express it as \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime integers, then compute \(m + n\).

First, we introduce variables for the logarithms:
- Let \(a = \log_{u}v\)
- Let \(b = \log_{v}w\)
- We need to find \(c = \log_{w}u\)

Using logarithm properties and change of base formula:
- \(\log_{u}(vw) = \log_{u}v + \log_{u}w = a + ab\) (since \(\log_{u}w = ab\))
- \(\log_{v}w = b\)
- \(\log_{v}u = \frac{1}{a}\)
- \(\log_{w}v = \frac{1}{b}\)

Substituting these into the given equations:
1. \(a + ab + b = 5\)
2. \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} = 3\)

From the second equation:
\[
\frac{a + b}{ab} = 3 \implies a + b = 3ab
\]

Substituting \(a + b = 3ab\) into the first equation:
\[
3ab + ab = 5 \implies 4ab = 5 \implies ab = \frac{5}{4}
\]

We need to find \(c = \log_{w}u\), which is the reciprocal of \(ab\):
\[
c = \frac{1}{ab} = \frac{4}{5}
\]

Thus, \(\log_{w}u = \frac{4}{5}\), so \(m = 4\) and \(n = 5\). Therefore, \(m + n = 4 + 5 = 9\).

\[
\boxed{9}
