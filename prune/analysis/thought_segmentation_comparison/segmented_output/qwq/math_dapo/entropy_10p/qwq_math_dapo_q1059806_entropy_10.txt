Okay, so I need to find the values of the real parameter \( a \) such that the equation \( \sin 2x \sin 4x - \sin x \sin 3x = a \) has exactly one solution in the interval \([0, \pi)\). Hmm, trigonometric equation with parameters... Alright, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, maybe I can simplify the left-hand side of the equation using trigonometric identities. Let me recall some product-to-sum formulas. The product of sines can be converted into a sum or difference. The identity is \( \sin A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(A - B) - \cos(A + B)] \). Let me apply this to both terms in the equation.

Starting with \( \sin 2x \sin 4x \):

Let \( A = 2x \) and \( B = 4x \). Then,

\( \sin 2x \sin 4x = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(2x - 4x) - \cos(2x + 4x)] \)
= \( \frac{1}{2} [\cos(-2x) - \cos 6x] \)
Since \( \cos(-\theta) = \cos \theta \), this simplifies to:
= \( \frac{1}{2} [\cos 2x - \cos 6x] \).

Now, the second term is \( \sin x \sin 3x \). Applying the same identity:

Let \( A = x \), \( B = 3x \):



---------------

\( \sin x \sin 3x = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(x - 3x) - \cos(x + 3x)] \)
= \( \frac{1}{2} [\cos(-2x) - \cos 4x] \)
Again, \( \cos(-2x) = \cos 2x \), so:
= \( \frac{1}{2} [\cos 2x - \cos 4x] \).

So

---------------

, putting both back into the original equation:

\( \sin 2x \sin 4x - \sin x \sin 3x = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 2x - \cos 6x] - \frac{1}{2} [\cos 2x - \cos 4x] \).

Let me simplify

---------------

 this expression step by step:

First, distribute the subtraction:

= \( \frac{1}{2} \cos 2x - \frac{1}{2} \cos 6x - \frac{1}{2} \cos 2x + \frac{1}{2} \cos 4x \)

Combine

---------------

 like terms. The \( \frac{1}{2} \cos 2x \) and \( -\frac{1}{2} \cos 2x \) cancel each other out:

= \( -\frac{1}{2} \cos 6x + \frac{1}{2} \cos 4x \)

So, the equation simplifies to:

\( \frac{1}{2} (\cos 4x - \cos 6x) = a \)

Hmm, maybe

---------------

 I can combine these cosine terms further? Let me see. There's another identity for \( \cos A - \cos B \).

---------------

 The identity is:

\( \cos A - \cos B = -2 \sin \left( \frac{A + B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A - B}{2} \right) \).

Let me apply that here with \( A = 4x \) and \( B = 6x \):

\( \cos 4x - \cos 6x = -2 \sin \left( \frac{4x + 6x}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{4x - 6x}{2} \right) \)
= \( -2 \sin(5x) \sin(-x) \)
But \( \sin(-x) = -\sin x \), so:

= \( -2 \sin 5x (-\sin x) \)
= \( 2 \sin 5x \sin x \)

Therefore, substituting back into the equation:

\( \frac{1}{2} (2 \sin 5x \sin x) = a \)
Simplifies to:
\( \sin 5x \sin x = a \)

Wait

---------------

 a second, that's interesting. So the original equation simplifies down to \( \sin 5x \sin x = a \). That seems simpler. Let

---------------

 me confirm that step again to make sure I didn't make an error in applying the identities.

Starting from the product terms, converted

---------------

 both products to sums, subtracted them, and ended up with \( \frac{1}{2} (\cos4x - \cos6x) \). Then using

---------------

 the identity for the difference of cosines, which led to \( \sin5x \sinx \). So that's correct.

So now, the equation is \( \sin5x \sinx = a \). We

---------------

 need to find values of \( a \) such that this equation has exactly one solution in \( [0, \pi) \).

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. Since

---------------

 the equation is \( \sin5x \sinx = a \), perhaps I can analyze the function \( f(x) = \sin5x \sinx \) over the interval \( [0, \pi) \), and find the values of \( a \) where the horizontal line \( y = a \) intersects the graph of \( f(x) \) exactly once.

Therefore

---------------

, to do this, I need to study the function \( f(x) = \sin5x \sinx \), find its extrema, and

---------------

 see for which \( a \) the equation has only one solution. Alternatively, maybe express \( f(x) \) in another form to

---------------

 make it easier to analyze.

Alternatively, perhaps use another trigonometric identity to combine \( \sin5x \sinx \). Let me recall

---------------

 that \( \sin A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(A - B) - \cos(A + B)] \). Let

---------------

 me apply that here.

So:

\( \sin5x \sinx = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(5x - x) - \cos(5x + x)] \)
= \( \frac{1}{2} [\cos4x - \cos6x] \)

Wait, that's the

---------------

 same expression we had earlier. So, actually, that's the same as the previous step. So maybe this approach is not

---------------

 helpful? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps express \( \sin5x \sinx \) in terms of multiple angles or another

---------------

 form. Alternatively, expand \( \sin5x \) using multiple-angle formulas?

Let me think. \( \sin5x \) can be written as \( \sin(2x + 3x) \), but that might not help. Alternatively, using

---------------

 the identity for \( \sin5x \):

Recall that \( \sin5x = 16 \sin^5x - 20 \sin^3x + 5 \sinx \). Hmm, but that might complicate things.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps write \( \sin5x \sinx \) as a product and consider the product's graph?

Alternatively, consider

---------------

 the function \( f(x) = \sin5x \sinx \), and analyze its behavior over \( [0, \pi) \).

Let

---------------

 me try to analyze \( f(x) \).

First, note that \( x \) is in \( [0, \pi) \). Let's consider

---------------

 the function \( f(x) = \sin5x \sinx \). To find the number of solutions to \( f(x) = a \), we can consider

---------------

 the graph of \( f(x) \) over the interval and see where horizontal lines intersect once.

To do this effectively, I

---------------

 need to find the critical points of \( f(x) \), its maxima and minima, and then determine the values of \( a \) where the equation has only one solution. This

---------------

 typically occurs at the maximum or minimum values of the function where the horizontal line touches only one point, or perhaps at points where the function is

---------------

 monotonic.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation \( \sin5x \sinx = a \) can be transformed into another equation.

---------------

 Let me see if I can write this as a single sine function or something else.

Alternatively, maybe use substitution. Let me set

---------------

 \( y = x \), so the equation is \( \sin5y \sin y = a \). Hmm, but

---------------

 not sure yet.

Alternatively, perhaps express \( \sin5x \) in terms of \( \sinx \), using multiple-angle identities.

Let

---------------

 me recall that \( \sin5x = 16 \sin^5x - 20 \sin^3x + 5 \sinx \). Therefore

---------------

, substituting into \( f(x) \):

\( f(x) = (16 \sin^5x - 20 \sin^3x + 5 \sinx) \cdot \sinx \)
= \( 16 \sin^6x - 20 \sin^4x + 5 \sin^2x \)

Hmm, that

---------------

's a sixth-degree polynomial in \( \sinx \). Maybe not so helpful for finding extrema.

Alternatively, perhaps consider

---------------

 the function \( f(x) \) over the interval \( [0, \pi) \), and compute its derivative to find critical points.

---------------

 Let me try that.

Let me compute \( f'(x) \):

\( f(x) = \sin5x \sinx \)

Using

---------------

 product rule:

\( f'(x) = 5\cos5x \sinx + \sin5x \cosx \)

Hmm, that

---------------

's a bit complex. Let me see if I can simplify this expression.

Alternatively, maybe factor or use trigonometric identities on

---------------

 the derivative.

Alternatively, set the derivative equal to zero to find critical points:

\( 5\cos5x \sinx + \sin5x \cosx = 0 \)

Hmm, let

---------------

 me see if this can be written as a single sine or cosine function. Let me note that \( \sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B \). Wait

---------------

, but the terms here are 5cos5x sinx + sin5x cosx. Hmm, not exactly a

---------------

 standard identity.

Alternatively, let me factor terms:

Let me see, 5cos5x sinx + sin5x cosx =0

Hmm

---------------

, perhaps factor out something? Not obvious. Alternatively, express in terms of sum formulas.

Alternatively, let me write the equation as:

5 cos5x sinx = - sin5x cosx

Divide both sides by cosx cos5x, assuming cosx and cos5x are not zero:



---------------

5 tanx = - tan5x

Hmm, but not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe use tan5x in terms of tanx?



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps use substitution. Let me set \( t = x \), so the equation is:

5 cos5t sin t + sin5t cos t = 0

Hmm, let

---------------

 me see if I can write this as a multiple-angle identity.

Alternatively, perhaps write sin5t cos t as (sin6t + sin4t)/2,

---------------

 using the identity sin A cos B = [sin(A+B) + sin(A-B)]/2. Similarly, 5 cos5t sin t = 5*(sin6t - sin4t)/2.

Let me try that:

First term: 5 cos5x sinx = (5/2)[ sin(5x + x) - sin(5x - x) ] = (5/2)[ sin6x - sin4x ]

Second term: sin5x cosx = (1/2)[ sin(5x + x) + sin(5x - x) ] = (1/2)[ sin6x + sin4x ]

Therefore, the

---------------

 derivative f’(x):

= (5/2)(sin6x - sin4x) + (1/2)(sin6x + sin4x)



---------------

Combine terms:

= [ (5/2 + 1/2) sin6x ] + [ (-5/2 sin4x + 1/2 sin4x) ]

= (3 sin6x) + (-2 sin4x)

Thus

---------------

, f’(x) = 3 sin6x - 2 sin4x

Hmm, so setting f’(x)=0 gives 3 sin6x - 2 sin4x =0.

Hmm, that

---------------

 seems manageable. Let me write that equation:

3 sin6x = 2 sin4x

Let me see if I can express sin6x in terms of sin4x.

---------------

 Let me recall that sin6x can be written as sin(4x + 2x) = sin4x cos2x + cos4x sin2x. Maybe

---------------

 that helps?

Alternatively, let me use multiple-angle identities.

Alternatively, let me express sin6x as 2 sin3x cos3x, but not

---------------

 sure.

Alternatively, perhaps express both sin6x and sin4x in terms of sin2x?

Alternatively, let me set

---------------

 θ = 2x, so that 6x = 3θ and 4x = 2θ. Then the equation becomes:

3 sin3θ - 2 sin2θ = 0

So

---------------

, 3 sin3θ = 2 sin2θ

Express sin3θ and sin2θ in terms of sinθ and cosθ:

sin3θ = 3 sinθ - 4 sin^3θ

sin2θ = 2 sinθ cosθ

Therefore substit

---------------

uting:

3 (3 sinθ - 4 sin^3θ) = 2 (2 sinθ cosθ)

S

---------------

implify left side: 9 sinθ - 12 sin^3θ

Right side: 4 sinθ cosθ

Bring all terms to left:

9 sinθ - 12 sin^3θ -4 sinθ cosθ = 0

Hmm, factor

---------------

 sinθ:

sinθ (9 - 12 sin²θ -4 cosθ ) =0

So, either sinθ =0, or the other factor is zero.

Case 1: sinθ =0 ⇒

---------------

 θ =0, π, 2π, etc. But θ =2x, and x ∈ [0, π), so θ ∈ [0, 2π). Thus �

---------------

�=0, π, 2π. But 2π would correspond to x=π, but x is in [0, π), so θ=0, π.

Thus,

---------------

 solutions from sinθ=0: θ=0, π ⇒ x=0, π/2.

Case 2: 9 - 12 sin²θ -4 cosθ =0

Hmm, this

---------------

 equation is a bit more complicated. Let me see if I can rewrite it in terms of cosθ.

We know that sin²θ =1 - cos²θ, so substitute:

9 -12(1 - cos²θ) -4 cosθ =0

Expand:

9 -12 +12 cos²θ -4 cosθ =0

Simplify:

-3 +12 cos²θ -4 cosθ =0

Multiply

---------------

 both sides by -1:

3 -12 cos²θ +4 cosθ =0

Rearranged:

-12 cos²θ +4 cosθ +3 =0

Multiply by -1 again to make it more

---------------

 standard:

12 cos²θ -4 cosθ -3 =0

This is a quadratic equation in cosθ. Let me denote y = cosθ:

12y² -4y -3 =0

Solving for y:

y = [4 ± sqrt(16 + 144)] / (24)

Because

---------------

 discriminant D = 16 + 4*12*3 =16+144=160

Wait

---------------

, discriminant D = b² -4ac = (-4)^2 -4*12*(-3)=16 +144=160

Thus,

y = [4 ± sqrt(160)] /24

sqrt(160)=4*sqrt(10), so:

y= [4 ±4√10]/24 = [1 ±√10]/6

Hmm

---------------

, so:

cosθ = [1 +√10]/6 or [1 -√10]/6

Wait

---------------

, compute numerical values:

First solution: [1 +√10]/6 ≈ [1 +3.1623]/6 ≈4.1623/6≈0.6937

Second solution: [1 -√10]/6≈ [1 -3.1623]/6≈-2.1623/6≈-0.3604

So

---------------

, cosθ must be between -1 and 1, which both are, so valid.

Therefore, θ= arccos([1 ±√10]/6 )



---------------

But θ is in [0, 2π). So we need to find all θ in [0,2π) such that cosθ equals those values. Then

---------------

, from θ, we can get x =θ/2, so x ∈ [0, π).

So, let

---------------

's compute the possible θ values:

For cosθ = [1 +√10]/6 ≈0.6937,

---------------

 the solutions are θ1 = arccos(0.6937), and θ2 = 2π - arccos(0.6937).

Similarly, for cosθ = [1 -√10]/6≈-0.3604, the solutions are θ3 = arccos(-0.3604), and θ4 = 2π - arccos(-0.3604).

Therefore

---------------

, total possible θ solutions from Case 2 are four angles, but we need to check if they are within [0,2π). Since

---------------

 arccos gives principal values between 0 and π, the other solutions would be in the second revolution?

Wait, no

---------------

. For the first case, cosθ ≈0.6937, so arccos gives an angle in first quadrant, and the other solution is in the fourth quadrant (since cosine is positive there). So

---------------

 θ1 ≈ arccos(0.6937) ≈46 degrees (approx 0.8 radians?), and θ2 �

---------------

� 2π - θ1 ≈5.48 radians (approx 314 degrees). But since θ is in

---------------

 [0, 2π), both are valid.

Similarly, cosθ≈-0.3604, so arccos(-0.3604) is in the second quadrant, say

---------------

 θ3≈111 degrees (≈1.94 radians), and θ4=2π - θ3≈4.34 radians (≈249 degrees). So

---------------

 all four angles are within [0,2π).

Therefore, the critical points for θ (i.e., 2x) are:



---------------

From Case 1: θ=0, π (so x=0, π/2)

From Case 2: θ1≈0.8 rad, θ2≈5.48 rad, θ3≈1.94 rad, θ4≈4.34 rad.

---------------

 So these correspond to x values:

x1=θ1/2≈0.4 rad, x2=θ2/2≈2.74 rad (but since

---------------

 θ2≈5.48 rad, which is more than π (≈3.14), so 5.48/2≈2.74 rad which

---------------

 is less than π (≈3.14), so that's okay.

Wait, 2.74 is less than π≈

---------------

3.14, so okay. Similarly, θ3≈1.94 rad ⇒ x≈0.97 rad, and θ4≈4.34 rad ⇒ x≈2.17 rad.

Therefore

---------------

, all these critical points are within [0, π).

Therefore, in total, the critical points of f(x) are at x=0, π/2, and the

---------------

 four x-values from Case 2. Wait, but how many total critical points?

From Case1: x=0 and x=π/2 (two

---------------

 points)

From Case2: four θ values, so four x-values (since each θ corresponds to one x). So

---------------

 total of 6 critical points? Wait, but perhaps some of them coincide?

Wait, let's see. The θ values

---------------

 from Case2 are distinct, so their x's are also distinct. So total critical points are 2 +4=6 points

---------------

. Hmm, but let me confirm.

Alternatively, maybe some of the θ's from Case2 lead to the same x?

---------------

 Probably not, since each θ is unique. So 6 critical points in total. Hmm.

Therefore, the function f(x)=sin5x sinx has 6 critical points in [0, π). Therefore

---------------

, the function has several local maxima and minima. To find the values of a where the equation has only one solution, we need to look

---------------

 at the extrema. The equation f(x)=a will have a unique solution when a is equal to the maximum or minimum value,

---------------

 but only if that extremum is achieved only once. Wait, actually, even if the extremum is achieved at two different points, but

---------------

 maybe when a is at a certain extremum that is a single point?

Wait, actually, for the equation f(x)=a to have exactly one solution, a

---------------

 must be such that the horizontal line y=a touches the graph of f(x) at exactly one point. That can happen in two cases:

1. When a is equal to the maximum value of f(x) and

---------------

 that maximum is achieved at only one point.

2. Similarly, when a is equal to the minimum value of f(x) and that minimum is achieved at only one point.

Alternatively, if

---------------

 the function has a unique extremum (either maximum or minimum) which is an extremum, but since we have multiple critical points, probably

---------------

 the function has multiple maxima and minima. Therefore, the only possible unique solutions would occur at the very highest maximum or the very lowest minimum, provided

---------------

 that those extrema are achieved only once. Alternatively, perhaps at points where the function crosses a certain a exactly once between critical

---------------

 points?

Alternatively, maybe the function f(x) reaches a certain a only once in the interval when the horizontal line is tangent to the graph at one

---------------

 point (i.e., a double root), but that would be a case where the equation has a double root, but since

---------------

 we need a unique solution, that would count as one solution (with multiplicity two, but since we're talking about real

---------------

 solutions in the interval, multiplicity might not matter here; the question says "unique solution", so maybe counting distinct solutions).

---------------

 Hmm, perhaps need to be careful here.

Alternatively, perhaps the function f(x) has certain peaks and valleys where only at the very

---------------

 top or bottom, the horizontal line touches only once. Let me try to sketch or analyze the function.

Alternatively, perhaps compute

---------------

 f(x) at critical points and endpoints to find the maxima and minima.

Wait, endpoints: the interval is [0, π). So endpoints

---------------

 are x=0 and approaching π (but not including π). Let me compute f(0) and f(π-

---------------

).

At x=0: f(0)=sin0 * sin0=0.

At x approaching π: Let me compute the

---------------

 limit as x approaches π from below.

sin5x sinx: as x→π, sinx approaches sinπ=0, sin5x approaches sin5π=0. So the

---------------

 product approaches 0. So f(π-) =0.

So the endpoints both approach 0.

Now, to find the max

---------------

ima and minima, we need to compute f(x) at the critical points.

Let me list all critical points:

From

---------------

 Case1:

x1=0 (endpoint, already considered),

x2=π/2 ≈1.5708.



---------------

From Case2:

Let me denote the four critical points from Case2 as:

x3≈0.4 rad,

x4≈0.97 rad,

x5≈2.17 rad,

x6≈2.74 rad.

Wait, actually

---------------

, the four x from Case2 are:

From θ1≈0.8 rad ⇒ x≈0.4 rad,

θ3≈1.94 rad ⇒ x≈0.97 rad,

θ4≈4.34 rad ⇒ x≈2.17 rad,

θ2≈5.48 rad ⇒ x≈2.74 rad.

Wait

---------------

, so the four critical points from Case2 are at approximately 0.4, 0.97, 2.17, and 2.74 radians.

So

---------------

 total critical points (excluding endpoints) are x=π/2 and the four from Case2. So total of five critical points inside

---------------

 the interval? Wait, no, including endpoints, but endpoints are already considered as critical points via the derivative.

Wait, actually

---------------

, the derivative at x=0: let me check, but perhaps f(x) is differentiable at all points except maybe

---------------

 endpoints, but since we are considering the interval [0, π), the critical points are where derivative is zero, so x

---------------

=0 is a critical point as well? Hmm, but at x=0, the derivative might not exist or is zero?

Wait, let

---------------

 me compute the derivative at x=0. The function f(x)=sin5x sinx. The derivative at x=0:



---------------

Using the derivative expression f’(x)=3 sin6x -2 sin4x,

At x=0, sin0=0, so f’(0)=0. So yes, x=0 is a critical point.

Similarly, at x=π/2, let

---------------

's compute f’(π/2):

sin6*(π/2)=sin3π=0,

sin4*(π/2)=sin2π=0,

so

---------------

 f’(π/2)=0 -0=0. So that's a critical point as well.

Therefore, the

---------------

 critical points are indeed at the endpoints and the four from case2.

Therefore, to find the maxima and minima, let

---------------

's evaluate f(x) at all critical points.

First, at x=0: f(0)=0.

At x=π/2: compute f(π/2):

sin5*(π/2) * sin(π/2).



---------------

sin(5π/2)=sin(π/2 + 2π)=sin(π/2)=1,

sin(π/2)=1,

so f(π/2)=1*1=1.

Hmm

---------------

, so f(π/2)=1.

At x approaching π: f approaches 0.

Now, let's compute f at the other critical points.



---------------

First, let's compute f at x3≈0.4 rad:

Compute f(0.4)=sin(5*0.4)*sin(0.4)=sin(2)*sin(0.4)

sin

---------------

(2 radians)≈0.9093,

sin(0.4)≈0.3894,

so product

---------------

≈0.9093*0.3894≈0.354.

Hmm, so approximately

---------------

 0.354.

Wait, but maybe better to compute more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of approximating, I

---------------

 can find exact values?

Alternatively, maybe we can compute the exact value for these critical points.

Alternatively, since this might take too long, perhaps proceed

---------------

 with approximate values.

Next, x4≈0.97 rad (which is θ3/2≈1.94/2≈0.97):



---------------

Compute f(0.97)=sin(5*0.97)*sin(0.97).

5*0.97≈4.85 rad,

sin(4.85)=

---------------

sin(4.85 - π) since π≈3.14,

so 4.85-3.14≈1.71 rad,

sin(1.71)≈0.988,

Wait

---------------

, sin(4.85)=sin(π + 1.71)= -sin(1.71)≈-0.988,

Wait

---------------

, but let me compute directly:

sin(4.85):

4.85 radians is in the third quadrant (π to

---------------

 3π/2?), since π≈3.14, so 4.85 is between π and 3π/2≈4.712.

---------------

 Wait, 4.85 is slightly above 3π/2≈4.712. So it's in the fourth quadrant? Wait,

---------------

 no, 3π/2 is 4.712, so 4.85 is just past that, so actually

---------------

 in the fourth quadrant? Wait, no:

Wait, π is ~3.14, 3π/2 ~4.712, 2π~6.28. So 4.85 is between 3π/2 and 2π? Wait, 3π/2 is ~4.712, so 4.85 is just

---------------

 past 3π/2, so in the fourth quadrant. In the fourth quadrant, sine is negative.

Therefore sin(4.85)=sin(π + (4.85 - π))=

---------------

sin(π +1.71)= -sin(1.71). Wait, but maybe better to compute numer

---------------

ically:

sin(4.85):

Using calculator input:

sin(4.85) ≈ sin(4.85) ≈ sin

---------------

(4.85 - 2π) ?

Wait, 4.85 radians is less than 2π (~

---------------

6.28), so directly compute:

sin(4.85) ≈ sin(4.85) ≈ let

---------------

 me use calculator:

sin(4.85):

Well, 4.85 radians is 4.85*(

---------------

180/π)≈277.8 degrees.

sin(277.8 degrees)=sin(360-82.2)= -sin(82.2)≈-0.990.

Thus

---------------

 sin(4.85)≈-0.990.

Then sin(0.97)≈sin(0.97)

---------------

≈0.824.

Thus f(x4)= sin(4.85)*sin(0.97)≈(-0.990)(0.824)≈-0.816.

Hmm, so approximately

---------------

 -0.816.

Wait, but let me check again:

Wait, sin(5x) when x=0.97 is

---------------

 5*0.97≈4.85 rad. So sin(4.85)≈-0.990

---------------

,

sinx= sin(0.97)≈0.824,

so product≈-0.990*0.824≈-0.816.

Okay

---------------

, so that's about -0.816.

Next, x5≈2.17 rad (θ4≈4.34 rad,

---------------

 so x≈2.17):

Compute f(2.17)=sin(5*2.17)*sin(2.17).

5*2.17≈10.85 rad,

sin

---------------

(10.85)=sin(10.85 - 3*2π)= since 3*2π≈18.84, so 10.85 is less than that. Alternatively

---------------

, subtract 2π once: 10.85 - 6.28≈4.57 rad,

sin(4.57).

---------------

 4.57 rad is between π (~3.14) and 3π/2 (~4.712). So in

---------------

 third quadrant.

sin(4.57)=sin(π + 1.43)= -sin(1.43)≈-0.989.

sin

---------------

(2.17)=sin(2.17). 2.17 rad is about 124 degrees (

---------------

since π≈3.14, so 2.17 is approx 124 degrees), so sin(2.17)≈0.808.

Thus, sin(10.85)*sin(2.17)≈(-0.989)(0.808)≈-0.800.

Hmm, so

---------------

 approx -0.8.

Wait, but let me check with calculator-like steps:

Alternatively, 5x=5*2.17=10.85 radians

---------------

,

10.85 - 3*2π=10.85 - 18.84≈-7.99 rad.

---------------

 Not helpful. Let's compute sin(10.85):

10.85 radians is equivalent to 10.85 - 3*2π?

---------------

 Wait, 2π≈6.28, so 10.85-6.28≈4.57 rad,

---------------

 which is as above.

sin(4.57)=sin(π + (4.57 - π))=sin(π +1.43)= -sin(1.43). 

---------------

1.43 rad≈82 degrees, so sin(1.43)≈0.989. So sin

---------------

(4.57)= -0.989.

Similarly, sin(2.17)=sin(2.17).

---------------

 2.17 is approx 124 degrees, sin(124°)=sin(56°)=0

---------------

.829? Wait, sin(124)=sin(180-56)=sin56≈0.829. Hmm

---------------

, so 0.829.

Thus, the product would be -0.989 * 0.829 ≈-0.821.

Hmm, so

---------------

 maybe approximately -0.82.

Wait, so x5≈2.17 gives f(x)≈-0.82.

Now

---------------

, x6≈2.74 rad (θ2≈5.48 rad, so x≈2.74):

Compute f(2.74)=sin(5*2.74)*sin(2.74).

5*2.74≈13.7 rad,

sin(13.7)=

---------------

sin(13.7 - 2*2π)=13.7 -12.566≈1.134 rad,

so

---------------

 sin(1.134)≈0.904.

Wait, but let me do it step by step:

1

---------------

3.7 radians: subtract 2π (6.28) gives 13.7-6.28≈7.42 rad,

again

---------------

 subtract 2π: 7.42-6.28≈1.14 rad,

so sin(13.7)=sin(1.14)

---------------

≈0.906.

Wait, but actually, sin(13.7)=sin(13.7 - 4π)

---------------

 since 4π≈12.566,

13.7 -12.566≈1.134 rad,

so sin(1.134)≈0.904.

sin

---------------

(2.74)=sin(2.74). 2.74 rad is about 156 degrees (since π≈3.14, so 2.74 is 

---------------

156 degrees). sin(156°)=sin(24°)=≈0.4067.

Wait, but

---------------

 156 degrees is 180-24, so sin(156)=sin(24)=≈0.4067.

Thus

---------------

, f(x6)=sin(13.7)*sin(2.74)≈0.904 *0.4067≈0.367.

Hmm

---------------

, so approximately 0.367.

Wait, let me check again:

sin(5x)=sin(13.7)=

---------------

sin(1.134)≈sin(1.134)≈sin(65 degrees?) Wait, 1.134 rad is about 65 degrees (since π/3≈1.047 is

---------------

 60 degrees, so 1.134 is ~65 degrees). So sin(65°)=≈

---------------

0.906.

sin(2.74 radians)=sin(156 degrees)=sin(24 degrees)=≈0.4067.

Thus

---------------

, the product is ≈0.906*0.4067≈0.368.

So

---------------

 approximately 0.37.

So summarizing:

Critical points and their f(x) values:

1. x=0: f=0

2. x≈0.4 rad: f≈0.354

3. x≈0.97 rad: f≈-0.816

4. x=π/2≈1.5708 rad: f=1

5. x≈2.17 rad: f≈-0.82

6. x≈2.74 rad: f≈0.367

7. x approaching π: f approaches 0.

Wait, but

---------------

 actually, the critical points are 0, π/2, and the four from Case2 (so total of 6 critical

---------------

 points). The above list includes all six.

So, compiling the approximate f(x) values at critical points:

- At x=0: 0

- x≈0.4 rad: ~0.354

- x≈0.97 rad: ~-0.816

- x=π/2 (~1.5708 rad): 1

- x≈2.17 rad: ~-0.82

- x≈2.74 rad: ~0.367

-

---------------

 At x approaching π: 0

So, from this, the maximum value of f(x) in the interval is 1 (at x=π/2), and the minimum values are approximately -0.82 at both x≈0.97 rad and x≈2.17 rad. The

---------------

 other critical points (0.4 and 2.74 rad) give f≈0.35 and 0.37, which are local maxima or

---------------

 minima?

Wait, let me see:

Looking at the values:

From 0 to π/2 (~1.57):

At

---------------

 x=0, f=0,

then at 0.4 rad (~23 degrees), f≈0.354

---------------

,

then at 0.97 rad (~55 degrees), f≈-0.816,

then at π/2 (~90 degrees), f=1.

Hmm, so between 0 and π/2, the function goes up to ~0.35, then down to -0.8, then up to 1?



---------------

Wait, that seems inconsistent. Wait, perhaps my approximations are off?

Wait, let me think again.

Wait, at

---------------

 x=0.4 rad (~23 degrees):

sin5x = sin(2 rad)≈0.909,

sinx≈

---------------

sin0.4≈0.389,

so their product is ~0.354.

At x=0.97 rad (~55.6 degrees):

sin5x =

---------------

 sin(4.85 rad)=sin(π + 1.71)≈-sin(1.71)≈-0.988,

sinx≈sin0.97≈0.824,

so product≈-0.816.

At

---------------

 x=π/2 (~1.57 rad):

sin5*(π/2)=sin(5π/2)=sin(π/2 + 2π)=sin(π/2)=1,

sin(π/2)=1,

so product=1.

So

---------------

 from x=0 to π/2, the function goes from 0 up to ~0.35, then down to ~-0.8,

---------------

 then up to 1? Wait, that would require a local maximum at x≈0.4, then a local minimum at x≈0.97, then up

---------------

 to π/2.

Wait, that might be possible. Let me see the graph.

Alternatively, perhaps between 0 and π/2, the function first

---------------

 increases to 0.35, then decreases to -0.8, then increases to 1? That seems possible if

---------------

 there's a local maximum at 0.4 and a local minimum at 0.97.

Then, from π/2 to π:

At π/2, f=1,

then at x≈2.17 rad (~124 degrees):

f≈-0.82,

then at x≈2.74 rad (~157 degrees):

f≈0.37,

and approaching π, f→0.

So from

---------------

 π/2 to π, the function goes from 1 down to -0.82, then up to 0.37, then down to 0.

Therefore

---------------

, the function has several peaks and valleys.

So the maximum value is indeed 1 at x=π/2, and the minimum value is approximately -0.82, achieved at two points: x≈0.97 rad and x≈2.17 rad.

Therefore

---------------

, the function f(x) reaches 1 only once (at π/2), reaches the minimum of ~-0.82 at two points, and has other local maxima and minima.

Therefore, to

---------------

 have the equation f(x)=a has exactly one solution in [0, π), the value a must be either:

1. The maximum value 1, because that

---------------

 is achieved only once (at π/2).

2. The value of f at some extremum which is achieved only once, but looking

---------------

 at the critical points, all other extrema (the local maxima and minima) are achieved at two points except for

---------------

 the global maximum.

Wait, the local maxima at x≈0.4 and x≈2.74 are both around ~0.35-0.37, so those

---------------

 might be the same value? Wait, in my approximate calculations, x=0.4 had ~0.354 and x=2.74 had ~0.367, which are close but not exactly the same. Maybe

---------------

 they are actually equal?

Wait, let's check with exact expressions.

Wait, perhaps the function is symmetric in some way?

Wait

---------------

, note that f(x) = sin5x sinx.

Let me check f(π - x):

f(π - x) = sin5(π -x) sin(π -x) = sin(5π -5x) sin(π -x)

sin(5π -5x) = sin(π -5x) because sin(5π -5x)=sin(π -5x +4π)=sin(π -5x),



---------------

and sin(π -x)=sinx.

Therefore, sin(5π -5x)=sin(π -5x)=sin5x cos

---------------

π - cos5x sinπ= -sin5x.

Wait, wait:

Wait, sin(5π -5x)=sin(5π)cos5x - cos5π sin5x,



---------------

sin5π=0, cos5π=cosπ= -1,

so sin(5π -5x)=0*cos

---------------

5x - (-1) sin5x= sin5x.

Wait, that contradicts the previous thought.

Wait, actually

---------------

, sin(5π -5x)=sin(π*(5) -5x)=sin(5π -5x)=sin(π*(5) -5x).

But

---------------

 since sin has a period of 2π, so sin(5π -5x)=sin(π -5x +

---------------

4π)=sin(π -5x).

Thus sin(π -5x)=sin5x cosπ - cos5x sinπ= -sin5x.

Wait, that

---------------

 would be:

sin(π -5x)=sinπ cos5x - cosπ sin5x=0*(-cos5x) - (-1)sin5x= sin5x.

Wait, no

---------------

, actually:

Wait, sin(A - B) = sinA cosB - cosA sinB,

so sin(π -5x)=sinπ cos5x - cosπ sin5x = 0*cos5x - (-1) sin5x = sin5x.

Ah

---------------

, right, so sin(π -5x)=sin5x.

Therefore, f(π -x)= sin(5(π -x)) sin(π -x) = sin(5π -5x) sin(π -x)= sin5x * sinx = f(x).

Thus, the function f(x) is symmetric about x=π/2. So

---------------

 f(π -x)=f(x).

Therefore, the graph of f(x) is symmetric around the line x=π/2.

Therefore, the

---------------

 critical points come in pairs symmetric around π/2. For instance, the critical point at x≈0.4 rad corresponds

---------------

 to π -0.4≈2.74 rad, which is exactly the x≈2.74 rad point

---------------

. Similarly, the critical point at x≈0.97 rad corresponds to π -0.97≈2.17 rad, which is the other critical

---------------

 point at ~2.17 rad. The critical point at π/2 is the center.

Therefore, the function's

---------------

 maximum at π/2 is unique, while all other extrema (local maxima and minima) occur in pairs symmetric around π/2.

Therefore, the minimum

---------------

 value of f(x) is achieved at two points (x≈0.97 and x≈2.17), and

---------------

 the local maxima at ~0.4 and ~2.74 are equal in value (due to symmetry), so those

---------------

 are also paired.

Therefore, the only extremum that is achieved at a single point is the global maximum at x=π/2.

---------------

 The global minimum is achieved at two points.

Therefore, the equation f(x)=a will have a unique solution only when a=1 (the global maximum)

---------------

 or when a is such that the horizontal line y=a intersects the graph at exactly one point elsewhere. Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 there are other points where the function is monotonic? For example, between certain critical points, the function might cross a certain

---------------

 a only once. But since the function is symmetric, maybe at some a between the local maxima and the global maximum, or

---------------

 between the local minima and the global minimum, there are two solutions, but at the exact extrema?

Wait, actually

---------------

, the only a for which the equation has exactly one solution is when a=1 (the global maximum). Because at any

---------------

 other a, the horizontal line would intersect the graph either twice (for a between the local maxima and the global maximum, or

---------------

 between the local minima and the global minimum), or four times (for a between the local maxima and minima), except at

---------------

 the extrema. However, the global minimum is achieved at two points, so when a equals the global minimum, the equation would have two solutions, so that's not unique. The

---------------

 only unique solution is when a is the global maximum, which is achieved only once.

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose

---------------

 a is slightly less than 1, then the equation would have two solutions near π/2, but since it's a maximum, actually

---------------

, near the peak, maybe only one solution? Wait, no. If the function reaches 1 at x=π/2, then just below 1, there would be two points near π/2 where f(x)=a,

---------------

 symmetric around π/2. But because of the symmetry, except exactly at the maximum.

Wait, actually, when a is exactly

---------------

 equal to the global maximum (1), the equation f(x)=a has only one solution (x=π/2). For any a less than 1, there would be two solutions near π/2 (

---------------

but actually, given the symmetry, two points symmetric around π/2). Wait, but since the function is symmetric about π/2, for

---------------

 any a less than 1, there are two solutions near π/2? Wait, let me think.

Wait, let

---------------

 me consider the graph. The function reaches maximum at π/2. To the left and right of π/2, the function decreases. So if

---------------

 you take a value just below 1, the equation f(x)=a would have two solutions: one slightly to the left of π/2 and another slightly to the right. But

---------------

 since the domain is [0, π), the right side of π/2 would go up to π. But due to the symmetry, the

---------------

 two solutions would be symmetric with respect to π/2. For example, if one solution is π/2 - ε, the other would be π/2 + ε. Since

---------------

 π/2 + ε is still less than π as long as ε < π/2. So yes, two solutions. Therefore

---------------

, only at a=1 does it have one solution.

Similarly, for the minimum value, which is approximately -0.82, achieved

---------------

 at two points, so setting a=-0.82 would give two solutions, so that's not unique.

However, maybe

---------------

 there are other points where the function's value is achieved only once?

Wait, the function is 0 at the endpoints x

---------------

=0 and x approaching π. So if a=0, the equation f(x)=0 would have solutions at x=0, approaching π, and possibly

---------------

 other points where sin5x sinx=0.

Wait, sin5x sinx=0 when either sinx=0 or sin5x=0.

sinx=0 ⇒ x=0, π.



---------------

sin5x=0 ⇒5x=kπ ⇒x=kπ/5, for integer k.

Within [0, π), x=0, π/5, 2π/5, 3π/5, 4π/5, π.

Thus

---------------

, the solutions to f(x)=0 are x=0, π/5, 2π/5, 3π/5, 4π/5, and approaching π.

Therefore

---------------

, when a=0, there are six solutions? Wait, but x=π is not included. So at x=π, the function approaches zero, but π

---------------

 is excluded. So the solutions are x=0, π/5, 2π/5, 3π/5, 4π/5. That

---------------

's five solutions. Hmm, so a=0 would give five solutions, which is more than one.

Therefore, a=0 is not a

---------------

 candidate.

Therefore, the only value of a for which there is exactly one solution is a=1.

Wait, but let

---------------

 me check if there are any other points where the function might touch a horizontal line only once.

For example, maybe at the local maxima or

---------------

 minima? The local maxima at ~0.35 and ~0.37 (but they are symmetric, so same

---------------

 value?), so if a is equal to that local maximum, then the equation would have two solutions (the two symmetric points). Similarly for the local minima.



---------------

Wait, but what about the points between the local maxima and minima? For example, between x=0.97 and x=2.17, the

---------------

 function reaches down to the minimum and then up again? Wait, but according to the critical points, after the minimum at x≈2.17, it goes up to ~0.37 at x≈2.74.

Wait

---------------

, perhaps there are some a values where the horizontal line intersects only once in a certain interval?

Alternatively, perhaps when a is greater

---------------

 than the local maxima but less than the global maximum, but then there would still be two solutions near the peak.

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 when a is equal to one of the local maxima or minima but only at one point? But they are achieved at two points due to symmetry.

Hmm

---------------

, so perhaps the only possible a with a unique solution is a=1.

Wait, but wait another thought: the problem says "in the interval [0, π)", so x

---------------

=0 is included but x=π is not. The function is 0 at x=0 and approaches 0 as x approaches π. So

---------------

 between x=0 and π, the function goes from 0 up to 1, then back down to 0. But with

---------------

 the oscillations in between.

Wait, but given the symmetry, perhaps the only unique solution is when a=1. Let

---------------

 me confirm with an example.

Suppose a=1. The only solution is x=π/2. Correct.

Suppose a=0.5

---------------

. Then there would be two solutions near π/2 (one on each side), two solutions near the local maxima,

---------------

 and so on? Wait, but depending on the exact value.

Alternatively, maybe there's another case where the horizontal line is tangent to the function at a point which

---------------

 is an extremum, but not the global one. For instance, if there is a point where the function has a horizontal tangent (critical point) and that

---------------

 is also the only point where f(x)=a, but since all other critical points are extrema achieved at two points, that

---------------

 can't happen.

Alternatively, maybe the endpoints? At x=0 and approaching π, f(x)=0. So if a=0, as

---------------

 before, but that has multiple solutions.

Therefore, after analyzing, I think the only value of a for which the equation has exactly one solution is a=1.

Wait, but hold

---------------

 on, let me check the function's behavior near the endpoints.

Wait, for a=0, there are multiple solutions.

---------------

 For a=1, only one solution. For a between the local maxima (~0.37) and 1, two solutions near the peak. For a between the local minima (~-0.82) and local maxima, there

---------------

 might be four solutions? Hmm.

Wait, let me consider an a between, say, 0.5 and 1. Then

---------------

 the horizontal line would intersect the graph twice near the peak (left and right of π/2), and maybe also intersect the

---------------

 ascending and descending parts from the local minima? Wait, no, since between the local maxima and the global maximum, the

---------------

 function only reaches up to 1, so between the local maxima (~0.37) and 1, the intersections

---------------

 would be two points near the peak. The other parts of the graph are lower.

Wait, perhaps plotting the graph would help, but since I can't do that here, let me think numer

---------------

ically.

Suppose a=0.5. Then:

Looking at the critical points:

Between x=0 and π/2, the function goes from 0 to ~0.35 at 0.4 rad, then down to ~-0.816 at 0.97 rad, then up to 1 at π/2. So between 0 and π/2, the function reaches 0.35, then goes down to -0.8, then up again. Therefore, to

---------------

 reach a=0.5, which is between 0.35 and 1, there would be two points:

---------------

 one between 0.4 rad and π/2 (ascending to 1), and another between 0 and 0.4 rad? Wait, no,

---------------

 because from 0 to 0.4, the function goes from 0 to 0.35, so it

---------------

 never reaches 0.5 there. From 0.4 to π/2, it goes from 0.35 down to -0.8 and

---------------

 back up to 1. Wait, that seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps my previous analysis was incorrect. Let me retrace.

Wait, at

---------------

 x=0.4 rad (~23 degrees):

f(x)=~0.354,

then at x=0.97 rad (~55 degrees), it's ~-0.816,

then at π/2 (~90 degrees), it's 1.

Wait, so from x=0.4 to π/2, the function goes from 0.35 down to -0.81

---------------

6 and then back up to 1?

That would mean that between 0.4 and π/2, the function first

---------------

 decreases to -0.816 at 0.97 rad, then increases to 1 at π/2.

Therefore, the

---------------

 function between 0.4 and π/2 has a local minimum at 0.97 rad, then rises.

Therefore, for

---------------

 a=0.5, the horizontal line would cross the graph:

- Once between 0.4 and 0.97 rad (since

---------------

 going from 0.35 down to -0.8, it must cross 0.5 once on the way down? Wait, no, going

---------------

 from 0.35 to -0.816, it would cross 0.5 downwards, but 0.5 is above 0.35? Wait, 0.5 is higher than 0.35, so actually

---------------

, after x=0.4, the function decreases below 0.35, so it never reaches 0.5 again in

---------------

 that interval. Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I need to think of the function's path:

From x=0 to x=0.4 rad:

---------------

 increasing to ~0.35,

then from x=0.4 to x≈0.97 rad: decreasing to -0.816,

then from x=0.97 rad to π/2: increasing to 1.

Therefore, between 0 and π/2, the function reaches a local maximum at x=0.4, then a local minimum at x≈0.97, then rises

---------------

 to the global maximum at π/2.

Therefore, the portion from x=0.4 to π/2 has a minimum

---------------

 at 0.97 and then increases to 1. So between x=0.97 and π/2, the function goes from -0.816 to 1. So for

---------------

 a=0.5, which is between -0.816 and 1, there would be two crossings in that interval: one between

---------------

 0.97 and π/2 (rising from -0.8 to 1), and another crossing between π

---------------

/2 and where?

Wait, no, after π/2, the function goes down again?

Wait, after π/2, up

---------------

 to π, let's see:

At π/2 (~1.57), f=1,

then at x≈2.17 rad (~124 degrees), f≈-0.82,

then at x≈2.74 rad (~157 degrees), f≈0.37,

then approaching π (~3.14), f approaches 0.

So from π/2 to π, the function decreases from 1 to -0.82 at 2.17 rad, then increases to 0.37 at 2.74 rad, then decreases to 0.

Therefore, between π/2 and π, the function has

---------------

 a local minimum at x≈2.17 rad and a local maximum at x≈2.74 rad.

Thus, for a=0.5, the

---------------

 horizontal line would intersect:

- Between x=0 and x=0.4 rad: once (rising from 0 to 0.35,

---------------

 but 0.5 is higher, so no),

- Between x=0.4 and x=0.97 rad: decreasing

---------------

 from 0.35 to -0.816: crosses 0.5 once on the way down? Wait, 

---------------

0.5 is above 0.35, so actually, the function never reaches 0.5 in that interval,



---------------

Wait, from 0.4 to 0.97 rad, it goes from 0.35 to -0.816, so it crosses

---------------

 0.5 downwards? No, it's going below 0.35, so it doesn't reach 0.5 again there

---------------

.

Then between x=0.97 rad and π/2 (~1.57), the function goes from -0.816 to 1. So it

---------------

 crosses 0.5 once on the way up.

Between π/2 and 2.17 rad (~2.17), it goes from 1 down to -0.82, so crosses 0.5 once on the way down.

Between 2.17 rad and 2.74 rad (~2.74), it goes from -0.82 to 0.37, so crosses 0.5? No, it

---------------

 goes from -0.82 up to 0.37, which is below 0.5, so doesn't reach 0.5 there.

Between 2.74 rad and π, it goes from 0.37 down to 0, so doesn

---------------

't reach 0.5.

Therefore, total crossings for a=0.5 would be two: one between 0.97 and π/2, and another between π/2 and 2.17 rad. So two solutions.

Similarly

---------------

, for a between the local maximum (0.37) and the global maximum (1), there would be two solutions near the peak (on

---------------

 either side of π/2). For a between the local minimum (-0.82) and the local maximum (0.37), there would be four solutions?

---------------

 Let me see:

Take a=0:

As before, five solutions, but a=0 is a special case.

Take a=-0.5:

Between x

---------------

=0.97 and π/2: going from -0.816 to 1, crosses -0.5 once,



---------------

Between π/2 and 2.17 rad: going from 1 to -0.82, crosses -0.5 once,

Between 2.17 and 2.74 rad: going from -0.82 to 0.37, crosses -0.5 once,

Also

---------------

 between 0 and 0.4 rad: function goes from 0 to 0.35, so doesn't reach -0.5,

Between

---------------

 2.74 and π: from 0.37 to 0, so no.

Thus total of three crossings? Wait, but

---------------

 at x=0.97 rad (~0.97), which is part of the first interval.

Wait, maybe

---------------

 four crossings? Hmm, need to be precise.

Alternatively, for a between the local minima and local maxima, there

---------------

 are four solutions: two on each side of the central peak.

Therefore, the only a with exactly one solution is a=1.

Wait

---------------

, but let me think if there's another case.

What about the local maxima at ~0.37? If a is exactly equal to that value, then the equation would have two solutions (the symmetric points at ~0.4 and ~2.74). Similarly

---------------

, if a is equal to the local minimum (~-0.82), two solutions.

Therefore, the only a with exactly one solution is a=1.

Wait

---------------

, but let me confirm with another value, say a=0.9, very close to 1.

Then, the equation f(x)=0.9 would have two solutions near π/2, one slightly left and one slightly right.

---------------

 Since the function reaches 1 at π/2, just below that, it would have two points close to π/2 where

---------------

 f(x)=0.9. So two solutions.

Only when a=1 is there exactly one solution.

Therefore, the answer is a=1.

Wait, but the

---------------

 problem says "values" plural. Maybe I missed something?

Wait, let me check the endpoints again. The function is zero at x=0 and approaches zero at x approaching π. So

---------------

 when a=0, there are multiple solutions (five?), but maybe at the very endpoints?

Wait, the equation is sin

---------------

2x sin4x - sinx sin3x =a. At x=0, all sines are zero, so f(0)=0. At x approaching π, sin

---------------

x approaches zero, sin2x=sin(2π)=0, sin3x=sin3π=0, sin4x=sin4π=0. So f

---------------

 approaches zero. So the function is zero at both ends but also at other points.

But the problem asks for solutions in [0, π). So,

---------------

 for a=0, the solutions are x=0, π/5, 2π/5, 3π/5, 4π/5, and approaching π (

---------------

but π is excluded). So exactly five solutions (excluding π). So a=0 is not unique.

Wait, but perhaps

---------------

 there is another maximum or minimum that is achieved only once?

Wait, the function's maximum is only at one point, so

---------------

 a=1 is unique.

Alternatively, is there another extremum only at one point?

Wait, due to the symmetry, every extremum except the central one has

---------------

 a pair. So the only unique extremum is the central maximum at x=π/2. Therefore, the only a with a unique solution is a=1.

Wait

---------------

, but let me check the value at x=0. When x=0, f(x)=0, but there are other points where f(x)=0, so that

---------------

's not unique.

Therefore, the only possible value is a=1.

Wait, but let me check if there is a case

---------------

 where the equation equals a at exactly one point in the interval, other than the maximum.

Wait, suppose a is such that the horizontal line touches

---------------

 the function exactly at one of the local extrema where the function turns around, but due to the symmetry, those are double

---------------

 points?

Hmm, no, since they occur at two points, so even if the line is tangent, it would be tangent at two symmetric points,

---------------

 so still two solutions.

Alternatively, maybe at a certain a, the function only crosses the line once in the entire interval?



---------------

Wait, for example, if a is greater than 1, then there are no solutions. If a is less than the minimum (~-0.82), also no solutions.

Between -0.82 and 1, there are solutions. The only a with exactly one solution is 1.

H

---------------

ence, the answer should be a=1.

Wait, but I need to make sure that there are no other points where the function might

---------------

 have a unique intersection.

Wait, suppose a=0.37, the local maximum. Then, the equation would have two solutions (the two symmetric points at

---------------

 ~0.4 and ~2.74 rad). Similarly, at a= -0.82, two solutions.

Therefore

---------------

, yes, only a=1 gives exactly one solution.

Therefore, the answer is 1.

Wait, but wait,

---------------

 hold on. Let me think again about the symmetry.

The function is symmetric about π/2. Therefore, for any a except the maximum and minima, the solutions come in pairs symmetric around π/2. The

---------------

 maximum is at the center, so it's the only solution for a=1. The minima are two points, so a=-

---------------

0.82 gives two solutions. The other critical points also come in pairs. Thus, the only a with exactly one solution is a=1.

Therefore, the answer is \

**Final Answer**
Answer: \boxed{1}


To determine the values of the real parameter \( a \) such that the equation 
\[ \sin 2x \sin 4x - \sin x \sin 3x = a \]
has a unique solution in the interval \([0, \pi)\), we start by simplifying the left-hand side using trigonometric identities.

First, we use the product-to-sum identities:
\[
\sin 2x \sin 4x = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 2x - \cos 6x]
\]
\[
\sin x \sin 3x = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 2x - \cos 4x]
\]
Subtracting these, we get:
\[
\sin 2x \sin 4x - \sin x \sin 3x = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 2x - \cos 6x] - \frac{1}{2} [\cos 2x - \cos 4x] = \frac{1}{2} (\cos 4x - \cos 6x)
\]
Using the identity for the difference of cosines:
\[
\cos 4x - \cos 6x = 2 \sin 5x \sin x
\]
Thus, the equation simplifies to:
\[
\sin 5x \sin x = a
\]

Next, we analyze the function \( f(x) = \sin 5x \sin x \) over the interval \([0, \pi)\). We find the critical points by taking the derivative:
\[
f'(x) = 5 \cos 5x \sin x + \sin 5x \cos x
\]
Setting \( f'(x) = 0 \) and solving, we find the critical points. Through

---------------

 analysis, we determine that the function \( f(x) \) has a maximum value of 1 at \( x = \frac{\pi}{2} \) and minimum values of approximately -0.82 at two points \(

---------------

 x \approx 0.97 \) and \( x \approx 2.17 \).

The function is symmetric about \( x = \frac{\pi}{2} \), meaning all local maxima and minima (except the global maximum) are achieved at two symmetric points. The global maximum of 1 at \( x = \frac{\pi}{2} \) is unique.

Thus, the equation \( \sin 5x \sin x = a \) has a unique solution only when \( a = 1 \), as this is the only value achieved by the function at a single point in the interval.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}
