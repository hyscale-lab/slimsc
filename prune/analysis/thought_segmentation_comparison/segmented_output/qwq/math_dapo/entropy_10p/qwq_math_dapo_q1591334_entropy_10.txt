Okay, so I have this problem here: Given a complex number z with |z|=1, find the maximum value of |z³ + z² -5z +3|. The answer needs to be in the form m√3/n, and then I have to find m + n. Hmm, alright

---------------

. Let me think step by step.

First, since |z| =1, that means z lies on the unit circle in the complex plane. So z

---------------

 can be written in the form e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Maybe I can express z as cosθ + i sinθ, using

---------------

 Euler's formula. That might help me convert the problem into trigonometric functions, which I can then maximize.

Alternatively, since

---------------

 |z|=1, I know that z̄ = 1/z. Maybe that's useful? Not sure yet. Let me see.

The expression we need to maximize is |z³ + z² -5z +3|. Hmm

---------------

. Since it's a modulus, maybe I can rewrite this expression in terms of z and its conjugate? Or perhaps use

---------------

 some properties of complex numbers on the unit circle.

Another thought: since |z|=1, then z^{-1} = \overline{z}, so maybe we

---------------

 can manipulate the expression to include terms like z + \overline{z} or z - \overline{z}, which relate

---------------

 to cosine and sine.

Alternatively, maybe we can parametrize z as e^{iθ} and substitute into the expression, then compute the modulus squared to turn it into a real function which

---------------

 can be maximized.

Let me try that approach. Let me set z = e^{iθ}, so z³ = e^{i3θ}, z² = e^{i2θ}, and so on. Then the expression becomes:

|e^{i3θ} + e^{i2θ} -5e^{iθ} +3|.

To find the modulus of this complex number, I

---------------

 can write it as the square root of the sum of squares of the real and imaginary parts. But maybe it's easier to compute the square of the modulus, which

---------------

 is easier to handle. Let me denote the expression inside as E = z³ + z² -5z +3, then |E|² = E * \overline{E}. Since |z|=1, \overline{z} = 1/z, so \overline{E} = \overline{z³} + \overline{z²} -5 \overline{z} +3 = z^{-3} + z^{-2} -5 z^{-1} +3.

Therefore, |E|² = (z³ + z² -5z +3)(z^{-3} + z^{-2} -5 z^{-1} +3). Hmm, that

---------------

 might be complicated, but perhaps expanding it could lead to simplifications.

Alternatively, maybe expanding the original expression in terms of trig

---------------

onometric functions. Let's try that.

Let z = cosθ + i sinθ. Then z² = cos2θ + i sin2θ, z³ = cos3θ + i sin3θ. So

---------------

 substituting into the expression:

E = (cos3θ + i sin3θ) + (cos2θ + i sin2θ) -5(cosθ + i sinθ) +3.

So

---------------

 the real part is cos3θ + cos2θ -5cosθ +3, and the imaginary part is sin3θ + sin2θ -5 sinθ.

Therefore, |E|² = [cos3θ + cos2θ -5cosθ +3]^2 + [sin3θ + sin2θ -5 sinθ]^2.

Hmm

---------------

, that's a bit messy, but maybe we can use trigonometric identities to simplify.

First, let me compute the real part:



---------------

Real = cos3θ + cos2θ -5cosθ +3.

Similarly, imaginary part:

Imaginary = sin3θ + sin2θ -5 sinθ.

Let

---------------

 me see if I can combine the trigonometric terms. For example, cos3θ and cos2θ can be expressed in terms of multiple angles.

---------------

 Let's recall that cos3θ = 4cos³θ - 3cosθ, and cos2θ = 2cos²θ -1. Similarly, sin3θ = 3sinθ -4sin³θ, and sin2θ = 2sinθ cosθ.

Maybe

---------------

 substituting these expressions into Real and Imaginary parts will help.

Starting with Real part:

cos3θ + cos2θ -5cosθ +3 = [4cos³θ -3cosθ] + [2cos²θ -1] -5cosθ +3

Let me compute term by term:

4cos³θ -3cosθ + 2cos²θ -1 -5cosθ +3

Combine like terms:

4cos³θ + 2cos²θ + (-3cosθ -5cosθ) + (-1 +3)

So

---------------

 that's:

4cos³θ + 2cos²θ -8cosθ +2.

Similarly, the imaginary part:

sin3θ + sin2θ -5 sinθ = [3sinθ -4sin³θ] + [2sinθ cosθ] -5 sinθ

Compute

---------------

 term by term:

3sinθ -4sin³θ + 2sinθ cosθ -5 sinθ

Combine like terms:

(3sinθ -5 sinθ) + 2sinθ cosθ -4sin³θ

Which

---------------

 is:

-2 sinθ + 2 sinθ cosθ -4 sin³θ.

Hmm, so now the Real part is 4cos³θ + 2cos²θ -8cosθ +2,

Imaginary part is -2 sinθ + 2 sinθ cosθ -4 sin³θ.

Hmm

---------------

, this still looks complicated, but perhaps we can factor some terms here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write everything in terms of cosθ and

---------------

 sinθ, and then express the modulus squared as (Real)^2 + (Imaginary)^2. Let me try

---------------

 that.

Let me denote x = cosθ, y = sinθ, with x² + y² =1.

So Real = 4x³ + 2x² -8x +2,

Imaginary = -2y + 2x y -4y³.

Therefore

---------------

,

|E|² = (4x³ + 2x² -8x +2)^2 + (-2y + 2x y -4y³)^2.

Hmm, this

---------------

 seems very involved. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps we can notice that z is on the unit circle, so z

---------------

^3 + z^2 -5 z +3 can be rewritten in terms of lower powers? Since |z|=1, then

---------------

 z^{-1} = \overline{z}, so maybe multiplying numerator and denominator by z^{-3} or something?

---------------

 Not sure.

Wait, maybe we can consider the polynomial f(z) = z^3 + z^2 -5 z +3. Since |z|=1, we

---------------

 can use the Maximum Modulus Principle, but that might not directly help here. Alternatively, perhaps we can write f(z) = z^3 + z^2 -5 z +3 and try

---------------

 to find its maximum on the unit circle.

Alternatively, maybe substitute z = e^{iθ} into f(z) and then compute |f(z)| as

---------------

 a function of θ, then find its maximum.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider writing f(z) as z(z² + z -5) +3, but not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, think

---------------

 of the expression as a function on the unit circle and use calculus to maximize it. Let me try that approach.

Let me param

---------------

etrize z = e^{iθ}, so f(θ) = e^{i3θ} + e^{i2θ} -5e^{iθ} +3.

The

---------------

 modulus squared is |f(θ)|² = (Real)^2 + (Imaginary)^2.

Let me compute Real

---------------

 and Imaginary parts again, perhaps using trigonometric identities.

Alternatively, perhaps using complex exponentials:

Let me write f

---------------

(z) = z^3 + z^2 -5 z +3. Since |z|=1, then z^

---------------

3 = z^{-(-3)}, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe consider the expression f(z) + \overline{f(z)} to get the real part, but not

---------------

 sure.

Alternatively, think of f(z) as a polynomial and use some transformation.

Alternatively, perhaps consider the problem as an

---------------

 optimization problem on the unit circle. Let me see.

Let me denote w = z, so |w|=1, and we need to maximize |w³ + w² -5w +3|.

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps consider the function f(w) = w³ + w² -5w +3, and since we are on the unit circle, maybe

---------------

 we can parametrize w as e^{iθ} and then compute the derivative with respect to θ, set to zero to find critical points.

Yes

---------------

, that might be a way. Let's try that.

Let me define f(θ) = e^{i3θ} + e^{i2θ} -5e^{iθ} +3. Then |f(θ)| is the modulus, and we need to maximize it over θ.

To

---------------

 find the maximum, we can compute the derivative of |f(θ)|² with respect to θ and set it to zero, since the square of the modulus will attain maximum at the same point.

Compute |f(θ)|² = f(θ) * \overline{f(θ)}. Let me compute f(θ) first

---------------

.

f(θ) = e^{i3θ} + e^{i2θ} -5e^{iθ} +3,

\overline{f(θ)} = e^{-i3θ} + e^{-i2θ} -5e^{-iθ} +3.

Therefore

---------------

,

|f(θ)|² = [e^{i3θ} + e^{i2θ} -5e^{iθ} +3][e^{-i3θ} + e^{-i2θ} -5e^{-iθ} +3].

Exp

---------------

anding this product would be quite tedious, but perhaps manageable.

Alternatively, maybe expanding using trigonometric identities. Let me think

---------------

 again of Real and Imaginary parts.

Earlier, I had expressions for Real and Imaginary parts in terms of cosθ and sinθ. Let me try

---------------

 to compute |E|² again step by step.

Real = 4cos³θ + 2cos²θ -8cosθ +2,

Imaginary = -2 sinθ + 2 sinθ cosθ -4 sin³θ.

Hmm

---------------

, maybe factor terms in Imaginary part:

Imaginary = -2 sinθ + 2 sinθ cosθ -4 sin³θ

= sinθ(-

---------------

2 + 2 cosθ -4 sin²θ)

Hmm, but sin²θ = 1 - cos²θ, so substitute that:

= sinθ [

---------------

 -2 + 2 cosθ -4(1 - cos²θ) ]

= sinθ [ -2 + 2 cosθ -4 + 4 cos²θ ]

= sinθ [4 cos²θ + 2 cosθ -6 ]

Hmm, not

---------------

 sure if that helps.

Alternatively, let me compute |E|² as (Real)^2 + (Imaginary)^2.

Let

---------------

 me compute Real squared first:

Real^2 = [4cos³θ + 2cos²θ -8cosθ +2]^2.

This

---------------

 is going to be a degree 6 polynomial in cosθ. Similarly, the Imaginary squared term will also be complicated.

This seems too

---------------

 involved. Maybe there is a better way.

Wait a second. Since |z|=1, perhaps we can write the expression as z

---------------

^3 + z^2 -5 z +3 = z^3 + z^2 -5 z +3, and note

---------------

 that since z ≠ 0 (since |z|=1), maybe factor out z?

Wait, z^3 + z^2 -5 z +3 = z(z² + z -5) + 3. Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 consider writing the expression as (z^3 + z^2) + (-5 z +3). Since z is on the unit circle, maybe

---------------

 bound each part?

Alternatively, perhaps consider specific values of z on the unit circle where the expression might attain maximum. For example, test

---------------

 z=1, z=-1, z=i, etc., and see if those give high values.

Let me try that

---------------

 approach first as a sanity check.

First, let z =1:

Then the expression becomes 1 +1 -5*1 +3 = 1 +1 -5 +3 =0. So |0|=0. Not helpful

---------------

.

z = -1:

Then (-1)^3 + (-1)^2 -5*(-1) +3 = -1 +1 +5 +3 =8. So |8|=8. Hmm, that's a candidate. But

---------------

 maybe there's a higher value?

Wait, 8 is already pretty big. Let me check z=i:

z=i:

---------------

 i^3 +i^2 -5i +3 = (-i) + (-1) -5i +3 = (-1 +3) + (-i -5i) = 2 -6i. The modulus is sqrt(2² + (-6)^2) = sqrt(4+36)=sqrt(40)=2√10≈6.324, which is less than 8.

z=-i:

Similarly, (-i)^3 + (-i)^2 -5*(-i) +3 = i + (-1) +5i +3 = ( -1 +3 ) + (i +5i )= 2 +6i. Modulus same as above, 2√10.

How

---------------

 about z= e^{iπ/3} (60 degrees):

cos(π/3)=0.5, sin(π/3)=√3/2. Let's compute:



---------------

First, compute z^3: e^{iπ}= -1,

z^2: e^{i2π/3} = cos(2π/3)+i sin(2π/3)= -0.5 + i(√3/2),

-5z: -5*(0.5 +i√3/2)= -2.5 -i(5√3)/2,

+3: +3.

Adding all terms:

z³:

---------------

 -1,

z²: -0.5 + i(√3/2),

-5z: -2.5 -i(5√3)/2,

+3: +3.

Adding

---------------

 real parts: (-1) + (-0.5) + (-2.5) +3 = (-4) +3 = -1.

Imaginary parts: (√3/2) + (-5√3/2) = (-4√3)/2 = -2√3.

Thus modulus

---------------

 is sqrt( (-1)^2 + (-2√3)^2 ) = sqrt(1 + 12) = sqrt(13) ≈3.605, which is less than 8.

Hmm. What

---------------

 about z= e^{i2π/3} (120 degrees):

Similarly, z^3 = e^{i2π}=1,

z^2 = e^{i4π/3}= cos(4π/3)+i sin(4π/3)= -0.5 -i(√3/2),

-5z= -5*(cos(2π/3)+i sin(2π/3))= -5*(-0.5 + i(-√3/2))? Wait, no

---------------

:

Wait z= e^{i2π/3} so cos(2π/3)= -0.5, sin(2π/3)=√3/2. So -5z is

---------------

 -5*(-0.5 + i√3/2) = 2.5 -i(5√3)/2,

plus

---------------

 3.

Adding all terms:

z³:1,

z²: -0.5 -i√3/2,

-5z: 2.5 -i(5√3)/2,

+3: +3.

Real parts: 1 + (-0.5) +2.5 +3 = (1 -0.5) =0.5; 0.5 +2.5=3; 3+3=6.

Imaginary parts: (-√3/2) + (-5√3/2) = (-6√3)/2 = -3√3.

Modulus sqrt(6² + ( -3√3 )² ) = sqrt(36 +27)=sqrt(63)=3√7≈7.937, which is close to 8 but still less.

Hmm, so at

---------------

 z=-1, we have 8, which is higher.

Wait, let me check another point. Maybe z= e

---------------

^{iθ} where θ is such that the derivative is zero?

Alternatively, perhaps z=-1 gives the maximum.

---------------

 But the problem states the answer is in terms of m√3 /n, so 8 is 8/1, which is 8√3 / (√3), but that

---------------

's not in the form. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake?

Wait, the problem says the answer is in the form m√3 /n. 

---------------

8 is 8/1, but that would require √3 in the denominator? Hmm, maybe there is a higher value?



---------------

Wait, let's check z= something else. Maybe θ= π, which is z=-1, already done. What

---------------

 about θ=0? z=1 gives 0. How about θ= π/2?

z=i as

---------------

 before, got 2√10 which is about 6.32, less than 8.

Wait, maybe

---------------

 another angle. Let me try θ= π/6 (30 degrees):

z= e^{iπ/6}= cos(π/6)+i sin(π/6)= (√3/2)+i(1/2).

Compute z

---------------

^3: e^{iπ/2}=i,

z^2: e^{iπ/3}= 0.5 +i(√3/2),

-5z: -5*(√3/2 +i/2)= - (5√3)/2 -i5/2,

+3: +3.

Adding all terms:

z³: i,

z²: 0.5 +i(√3/2),

-5z: - (5√3)/2 -i5/2,

+3: +3.

Real parts: 0.5 +3 - (5√3)/2,



---------------

Imaginary parts: 1 (from i) + (√3/2) -5/2.

Wait, let me compute step

---------------

 by step:

Real parts:

z³ is purely imaginary, so real part 0,

z²: 0.5,

-5z: -5*(√3/2),

+3: +3.

So total real part: 0.5 - (5√3)/2 +3 = (3.5) - (5√3)/2 ≈3.5 - 4.330

---------------

 ≈-0.830.

Imaginary parts:

z³: i (so 1),

z²: (�

---------------

�3/2)i,

-5z: -5*(1/2)i = -2.5i,

+3: 0.

Total imaginary part: 1 + (√3/2) -2.5 ≈1 +0.866 -2.5≈-0.634.

So

---------------

 modulus squared is (-0.83)^2 + (-0.634)^2 ≈0.689 +0.402≈1.09, so modulus ~1.04, which

---------------

 is small.

Hmm, so so far, z=-1 gives the maximum of 8. But the problem states the answer should be in the form m√3 over n, so 

---------------

8 is 8/1, but perhaps there's a higher value?

Wait, maybe I made an error in calculation at

---------------

 z= e^{i2π/3}?

Wait let me recalculate that:

z= e^{i2π/3},

---------------

 so:

z^3 = e^{i2π} =1,

z^2 = e^{i4π/3}= cos(4π/3)+i sin(4π/3)= -0.5 -i*(√3/2),

-5 z = -5*(cos(2π/3)+i sin(2π/3)) = -5*(-0.5 +i*(√3/2)) = 2.5 -i*(5√3/2),

+3.



---------------

Adding all terms:

Real parts:

z^3:1,

z^2:-0.5,

-5z:2.5,

+3:3,

Total real: 1 -0.5 +2.5 +3 = (1-0.5)=0.5; 0.5+2.5=3; 3+3=6.

Imaginary parts:

z^2: -i*(√3/2),

-5z: -i*(5√3/2),

Total imaginary: -i*(√3/2 +5√3/2)= -i*(3√3).

Thus

---------------

, modulus squared is 6² + (3√3)^2= 36 +27=63, so modulus sqrt(63)=3√7≈7.937, which is indeed

---------------

 less than 8. So z=-1 gives 8.

Hmm, so maybe 8 is the maximum? But why the

---------------

 problem says the answer is in the form m√3/n?

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake here. Because 8 is an

---------------

 integer, but the problem specifies the answer should be m√3 over n. Maybe my assumption that z=-1 gives the maximum is wrong? Or

---------------

 maybe I made a mistake in calculation?

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum is indeed 8, but expressed as 8√3/(√3), but that complic

---------------

ates things. Alternatively, maybe there's another point where the modulus is higher?

Wait let me try z= e^{iθ} where θ is such that the

---------------

 expression reaches a higher value.

Alternatively, maybe parametrizing in terms of x = cosθ, since sinθ squared is 1 -x². Let me try

---------------

 to write everything in terms of x.

Let me recall the Real and Imaginary parts:

Real =4x³ + 2x² -8x +2,

Imaginary = -2y + 2xy -4y³,

---------------

 where y = sinθ.

But since y² =1 -x², maybe substitute y in terms of x. Let

---------------

 me see.

Imaginary = -2y + 2x y -4 y³ = y(-2 +2x -4y²). Hmm

---------------

, but y² =1 -x², so y³ = y*(1 -x²). So substituting:

Imaginary = y [

---------------

 -2 +2x -4(1 -x²) ]

= y [ -2 +2x -4 +4x² ]

= y [4x² +2x -6]

Hmm

---------------

, so Imaginary = y*(4x² + 2x -6).

Therefore, |E|² = (Real)^2 + (Imaginary)^2.

Let

---------------

 me write Real as R and Imaginary as I.

So |E|² = R² + I².

Let me substitute

---------------

 I = y*(4x² +2x -6). Since y = sqrt(1 -x²), but with

---------------

 a ± sign. Hmm, but since we are squaring it anyway, maybe express in terms of x.

Wait, let

---------------

's compute I²:

I² = y²*(4x² +2x -6)^2 = (1 -x²)*(4x² +2x -6)^2.

Therefore

---------------

,

|E|² = [4x³ +2x² -8x +2]^2 + (1 -x²)*(4x² +2x -6)^2.

This is a function of x,

---------------

 where x is in [-1,1].

Hmm, perhaps this is a function we can maximize over x in [-1,1].

This

---------------

 seems very complicated, but maybe we can try plugging in x=-1, since that gives z=-1, which we already saw gives 8.

Let

---------------

 me check x=-1:

At x=-1,

Real =4*(-1)^3 +2*(-1)^2 -8*(-1) +2 = -4 +2 +8 +2 =8,

Imaginary =

---------------

 y*(4*(-1)^2 +2*(-1) -6) = y*(4 -2 -6)= y*(-4).

But since

---------------

 x=-1, y=0 (since sinθ=0 when cosθ=-1). So Imaginary term is 0. Therefore

---------------

 modulus squared is 8²=64, so modulus is 8, which matches.

Now, let me try x=1:

x=1,

Real =4*1 +2*1 -8*1 +2=4+2-8+2=0,

Imaginary = y*(4*1 +2*1 -6)= y*(0). Since x=1, y=0, so imaginary

---------------

 term is 0. Thus modulus is 0, as before.

Now, let me try x=0.5:



---------------

x=0.5,

Real =4*(0.125) +2*(0.25) -8*(0.5)+2 =0.5 +0.5 -4 +2 = (0.5+0.5)=1; 1-4=-3; -3+2=-1,

Imaginary =

---------------

 y*(4*(0.25) +2*(0.5) -6) = y*(1 +1 -6)= y*(-4). Since x=0.5, y= sqrt(3)/2,



---------------

Thus Imaginary = (sqrt(3)/2)*(-4)= -2√3,

Therefore modulus squared is (-1)^2 + (-2√3)^2 =1 + 12=13, modulus sqrt(13)≈3.605.



---------------

Same as before.

Hmm, maybe try x=0. Let me see:

x=0,

Real =0 +0 -0 +2=2,

Imaginary = y*(0 +0 -6)= y*(-6). Since x=0, y=±1,

Thus, Imaginary =

---------------

 ±(-6),

Therefore modulus is sqrt(2² +6²)=sqrt(40)=2√10≈6.324.

Hmm

---------------

, same as when z=i.

Wait, maybe try x=0. Let me see another x value.

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 x= -0.5?

x= -0.5,

Real =4*(-0.125) +2*(0.25) -8*(-0.5)+2 = -0.5 +0.5 +4 +2 = (-0.5+0.5)=0; 0+4+2=6,

Imaginary = y*(4*(0.25) +2*(-0.5) -6)= y*(1 -1 -6)= y*(-6).

Since x=-0.5, y= sqrt(3)/2,



---------------

Thus, Imaginary = (sqrt(3)/2)*(-6)= -3√3,

Thus modulus squared is 6² + ( -3√3 )² =36 +27=63, modulus sqrt(63)=3√7≈7.937.

---------------

 Same as when θ=2π/3.

Hmm, so so far, the maximum is at x=-1 (z=-1) with modulus 8. However

---------------

, the problem states the answer should be in the form m√3/n. Hmm, that suggests that maybe my assumption is wrong and

---------------

 the maximum is actually something else?

Alternatively, maybe there's a point where the modulus is higher than 8?

Wait, let me think

---------------

 again.

Wait, let me check z= e^{iθ} where θ is such that the expression is maximized. To

---------------

 do this, perhaps I can consider the function f(θ)= |z³ + z² -5 z +3|²

---------------

, and set its derivative to zero.

Alternatively, maybe using calculus of real variables. Let me consider θ as variable and

---------------

 compute d/dθ |f(θ)|² =0.

Let me denote f(θ) = e^{i3θ} + e^{i2θ} -5e^{iθ} +3,

then |f(θ)|² = f(θ) * \overline{f(θ)} = [e^{i3θ} + e^{i2θ} -5e^{iθ} +3][e^{-i3θ} + e^{-i2θ} -5e^{-iθ} +3].

Let me compute this product step

---------------

 by step:

Let me denote A = e^{i3θ}, B = e^{i2θ}, C= e^{iθ}, D=3,

then

---------------

 \overline{A}=e^{-i3θ}, \overline{B}=e^{-i2θ}, \overline{C}=e^{-iθ}, \overline{D}=3,

So

---------------

 the product is (A + B -5C + D)(\overline{A} + \overline{B} -5\overline{C} + D).

Expanding this:



---------------

A\overline{A} + A\overline{B} + A*(-5\overline{C}) + A D +

B\overline{A} + B\overline{B} + B*(-5\overline{C}) + B D +

(-5C)\overline{A} + (-5C)\overline{B} + (-5C)*(-5\overline{C}) + (-5C) D +

D\overline{A} + D\overline{B} + D*(-5\overline{C}) + D².

But

---------------

 this is going to be a lot of terms. Let me see if there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, note that A

---------------

\overline{A}= |A|²=1, since |e^{i3θ}|=1,

Similarly, B\overline{B}=1, C\overline{C}=1,

D

---------------

\overline{D}=9,

The cross terms:

A\overline{B}= e^{i3θ}e^{-i2θ}=e^{iθ},

A*(-5\overline{C}) = -5 e^{i3θ}e^{-iθ}= -5 e^{i2θ},

A D= A*3 =3 e^{i3θ},

Similarly,

---------------

 B\overline{A}=e^{i2θ}e^{-i3θ}=e^{-iθ},

B*(-5\overline{C})= -5 e^{i2θ}e^{-iθ}= -5 e^{iθ},

B D=3 e^{i2θ},

Contin

---------------

uing:

(-5C)\overline{A}= -5 e^{iθ} e^{-i3θ}= -5 e^{-i2θ},

(-5C)\overline{B}= -5 e^{iθ}e^{-i2θ}= -5 e^{-iθ},

(-5C)*(-5\overline{C})=25 |C|²=25,

(-5C) D= -15 e^{iθ},

D\overline{A}=3 e^{-i3θ},

D\overline{B}=3 e^{-i2θ},

D*(-5\overline{C})= -15 e^{-iθ},

D²=9.

Now

---------------

, let's collect all terms:

First, the squared terms:

|A|² + |B|² + |C|² + |D|² =1 +1 +1 +9=12.

Then the cross terms:

Terms

---------------

 with e^{iθ}:

A\overline{B}=e^{iθ},

B\overline{A}=e^{-iθ},

A

---------------

 D=3 e^{i3θ},

B D=3 e^{i2θ},

and others?

Wait, perhaps this

---------------

 is getting too complicated. Let me see:

Wait, actually, this is going to take a while. Let me try to collect

---------------

 terms by exponentials:

Terms with e^{i3θ}:

A D = 3 e^{i3θ},

Terms with e^{-i3θ}:

D\overline{A}=3 e^{-i3θ},

Terms with e^{i2θ}:

A*(-5\overline{C}) = -5 e^{i2θ},

B D =3 e^{i2θ},

Terms with e^{-i2θ}:

(-5C)\overline{A}= -5 e^{-i2θ},

D\overline{B}=3 e^{-i2θ},

Terms with e^{iθ}:

A\overline{B}=e^{iθ},

B*(-5\overline{C})= -5 e^{iθ},

(-5C)\overline{B}= -5 e^{-iθ} (

---------------

Wait, no, that was e^{-iθ}? Let me check:

Wait, (-5C)\overline{B}= -5 e^{iθ} e^{-i2θ}= -5 e^{-iθ},



---------------

Similarly, terms with e^{-iθ}:

B\overline{A}=e^{-iθ},

(-5C)\overline{B}= -5 e^{-iθ},

D*(-5\overline{C})= -15 e^{-iθ},

Terms

---------------

 with constants:

The term from (-5C)*(-5\overline{C})=25,

and also terms

---------------

 like (-5C)*D = -15 e^{iθ},

Wait, maybe I missed some terms.

This is getting too involved

---------------

. Maybe I can instead compute the derivative numerically?

Alternatively, perhaps there is a smarter approach.

Wait a minute, let

---------------

 me think again. Since |z|=1, then z^{-1}= \overline{z}, so we can write

---------------

 the expression z^3 + z^2 -5 z +3 as z^3 + z^2 -5 z +3.

Perhaps

---------------

 we can consider the expression as follows:

Let me denote the polynomial f(z)= z^3 + z^2 -5 z +3. Since

---------------

 |z|=1, maybe we can write f(z)= z^3 + z^2 -5 z +3 =

---------------

 z(z² + z -5) +3.

Hmm, perhaps using the triangle inequality? Let's see.

|f(z)| = |z(z² + z -5) +3| ≤ |z(z² + z -5)| + |3| = |z² + z -5| +3.

---------------

 Since |z|=1,

|z² + z -5| ≤ |z²| + |z| + | -5 | =1+1+5=7,

so

---------------

 |f(z)| ≤7+3=10. But we have already found a point where |f(z)|=8, so this

---------------

 is a loose bound.

Alternatively, perhaps reverse triangle inequality? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe consider that z^3 + z^2 -5 z +3 = (z^3 + z^2) -5(z - (3/5)).

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 consider writing the expression as follows:

Let me think of f(z) = z^3 + z^2 -5 z +3 = (z^3 + z^2) + (-5z +3).

Since

---------------

 z is on the unit circle, maybe we can bound each part?

Alternatively, perhaps factor the polynomial. Let me see if f(z) can be factored.

Sup

---------------

pose f(z) = z^3 + z^2 -5 z +3. Let's try rational roots. Possible roots are ±1, ±3.

Testing z=1: 1+1-5+3=0. So z=1 is a root.



---------------

Therefore, we can factor f(z) as (z-1)(z² + 2z -3).

Let me check: (z-1)(z² +2z -3) = z³ +2z² -3z -z² -2z +3 = z³ +z² -5z +3. Yes, correct.

Therefore, f(z)= (z-1)(z² +2 z -3).

Now

---------------

, since z is on the unit circle, maybe this helps. Let's see:

We need to compute |f(z)| = |z-1| * |z² +2 z -3|.

Hmm

---------------

, so the modulus is the product of |z-1| and |z² +2 z -3|.

Maybe

---------------

 this factorization helps in finding the maximum?

Let me denote A = |z -1|,

and B = |z² +2 z -3|,

so |f(z)|= A * B.

We

---------------

 need to maximize A*B over |z|=1.

Hmm, perhaps we can write z as e^{iθ} again and

---------------

 compute A*B.

Let me try that.

Let z = e^{iθ}, so A = |e^{iθ} -1| = sqrt{(cosθ -1)^2 + sin²θ} = sqrt{2 - 2cosθ}.

Similarly

---------------

, B = |z² + 2 z -3|.

Let me compute B:

z² +2 z -3 = e^{i2θ} + 2 e^{iθ} -3.

Express

---------------

ed in terms of cosθ and sinθ,

Real part: cos2θ +2 cosθ -3,

Imaginary part: sin2θ + 2 sinθ.

Therefore, B²

---------------

 = (cos2θ +2 cosθ -3)^2 + (sin2θ +2 sinθ)^2.

Let

---------------

 me compute this:

First, expand Real part squared:

(cos2θ +2cosθ -3)^2 = cos²2θ +4cos²θ +9 +4cos2θ cosθ -6cos2θ -12cosθ,

Wait, actually

---------------

, better to compute step by step:

Let me denote R = cos2θ +2cosθ -3,

I = sin2θ +2 sinθ,

then B² = R² + I².

Compute R² + I²:

= [cos2θ +2cosθ -3]^2 + [sin2θ +2 sinθ]^2.

Let me expand each

---------------

 term.

First term:

[cos2θ +2cosθ -3]^2 = (cos2θ)^2 + (2cosθ)^2 + (-3)^2 + 2*cos2θ*(2cosθ) + 2*cos2θ*(-3) + 2*(2cosθ)*(-3)

= cos²2θ +4cos²θ +9 +4cos2θ cosθ -6cos2θ -12cosθ.

Second term:

[sin2θ +2 sinθ]^2 = sin²2θ +4 sin²θ +4 sin2θ sinθ.

Thus

---------------

, adding both terms:

cos²2θ +4cos²θ +9 +4cos2θ cosθ -6cos2θ -12cosθ + sin²2θ +4 sin²θ +4 sin2θ sinθ.

Now, group

---------------

 terms:

cos²2θ + sin²2θ =1,

4cos²θ +4 sin²θ =4(cos²θ + sin²θ)=4,

Then

---------------

 remaining terms:

9,

+4cos2θ cosθ -6cos2θ -12cosθ,

+4 sin2θ sinθ,

Thus

---------------

 total:

1 +4 +9 + [4cos2θ cosθ -6cos2θ -12cosθ +4 sin2θ sinθ].

S

---------------

implify constants: 1+4+9=14.

Now, the remaining terms:

4cos2θ cosθ +4 sin2θ sinθ -6cos2θ -12cosθ.

Notice that 4cos2θ cosθ +4 sin2θ sinθ =4[cos2θ cosθ + sin2θ sinθ] =4cos(2θ -θ)=4cosθ,

---------------

 using cosine of difference identity.

Wait, cos(A - B)=cosA cosB + sinA sinB,

so cos2θ cosθ + sin2θ sinθ = cos(2θ -θ)=cosθ.

Therefore, that

---------------

 term becomes 4cosθ.

Thus, the remaining terms simplify to:

4cosθ -6cos2θ -12cosθ



---------------

= (4cosθ -12cosθ) -6cos2θ

= (-8cosθ) -6cos2θ.

Therefore, total

---------------

 B² =14 -8cosθ -6cos2θ.

Therefore, B squared is 14 -8cosθ -6cos2θ.

Hmm

---------------

, so B = sqrt(14 -8cosθ -6cos2θ).

Therefore, the expression to maximize is A*B = sqrt(2-2cosθ) * sqrt(14 -8cosθ -6cos2θ).

Hmm, this

---------------

 is still complicated, but perhaps manageable.

Let me denote x = cosθ. Since cos2θ = 2x² -1,

Thus

---------------

, substitute into B squared:

14 -8x -6*(2x² -1)=14 -8x -12x² +6=20 -8x -12x².

Thus, B squared becomes

---------------

 20 -8x -12x²,

and A squared is 2-2x,

so the product (A*B)^2 = (2-2x)(20 -8x -12x²).

Therefore

---------------

, to maximize |f(z)|, we can maximize sqrt[(2-2x)(20 -8x -12x²)] over x in [-1,1].

Since

---------------

 the square root is a monotonic function, it's equivalent to maximizing the expression inside:

Let me compute the product:

(2 -2x)(20 -8x -12x²) =2*(1 -x)*(20 -8x -12x²).

Let me expand this:

First, compute

---------------

 (1 -x)(20 -8x -12x²):

=1*(20 -8x -12x²) -x*(20 -8x -12x²)

=20 -8x -12x² -20x +8x² +12x³

Combine like terms:

20,

-8x -20x = -28x,

-12x² +8x² = -4x²,

+12x³.

Thus, total expression

---------------

:

12x³ -4x² -28x +20.

Multiply by 2:

2*(12x³ -4x² -28x +20) =24x³ -8x² -56x +40.

Wait, no

---------------

, wait: the previous step was (1 -x)(20 -8x -12x²)=12x³ -4x² -28x +20,

then multiplied

---------------

 by 2 gives 24x³ -8x² -56x +40. Wait, no,

---------------

 actually:

Wait, the original product (2 -2x)(20 -8x -12x²)=2*(1 -x)*(20 -8x -12x²)=

---------------

2*(12x³ -4x² -28x +20).

Thus, the expression to maximize is 2*(12x³ -4x² -28x +20)=

---------------

24x³ -8x² -56x +40.

Wait, but we are trying to maximize the product

---------------

 (2-2x)(20 -8x -12x²), which is equal to 24x³ -8x² -56x +40?



---------------

Wait let me verify:

Wait, let me redo the expansion step:

(1 -x)(20 -8x -12x²) = 1*(20 -8x -12x²) -x*(20 -8x -12x²)

= 20 -8x -12x² -20x +8x² +12x³

=

---------------

20 - (8x +20x) + (-12x² +8x²) +12x³

=20 -28x -4x² +12x³.

So

---------------

 yes, that's 12x³ -4x² -28x +20.

Multiply by 2 gives 24x³ -8x² -56x +40.

Therefore

---------------

, the expression inside the square root is 24x³ -8x² -56x +40, and we need to maximize this

---------------

 over x in [-1,1].

Hmm, so now we can treat this as a cubic function in x, f(x)=24x³ -8x² -56x +40,

---------------

 and find its maximum on [-1,1].

To find the maximum, we can take derivative and set to zero.

Compute f’(x)=72x² -16x -56.

Set to zero:

72x² -16x -56 =0.

Divide both sides by 8: 9x² -2x -7 =0.

Solve quadratic equation:

x = [2 ± sqrt(4 + 4*9*7)]/(2*9) = [2 ± sqrt(4 +252)]/18 = [2 ± sqrt(256)]/18 = [2 ±16]/18.

Thus,

x=(2+16)/18=18/18=1,

x=(2-16)/18=(-14)/18= -7/9≈-0.777...

Therefore critical points at x=1 and x= -7/9.

Now, evaluate f(x) at critical points and endpoints.

Endpoints:



---------------

At x=1,

f(1)=24(1) -8(1) -56(1)+40=24-8-56+40=0.

At x=-1,

f(-1)=24*(-1)^3 -8*(-1)^2 -56*(-1)+40= -24 -8 +56 +40= (-24-8)+(56+40)= -32 +96=64.

Critical points:

At x=1:

---------------

 already done, gives 0.

At x=-7/9,

Compute f(-7/9):

First, compute each term:

24x³ =24*(-343)/(729)= but

---------------

 this might be tedious.

Alternatively, compute numerically:

x= -7/9≈-0.7778.

Compute 

---------------

24x³: 24*(-0.7778)^3≈24*(-0.473)=≈-11.35,

-8x²: -8*(0.605)=≈-4.84,

-56x: -56*(-0.7778)=≈43.55,

+40.



---------------

Adding up:

-11.35 -4.84 +43.55 +40≈(-16.19) +83.55≈67.36.

Wait

---------------

 let me compute more accurately:

First, let's compute exact value:

Let me compute f(-7/9):

24*(-7/9)^3 -8*(-7/9)^2 -56*(-7/9) +40.

Compute each term:

First term:

24*(-343)/(729) =

---------------

24*(-343)/729,

Second term:

-8*(49/81)= -392/81,

Third term:

-56*(-7/9)= 392/9,

Fourth term:

40.

Let

---------------

 me compute term by term:

First term: 24*(-343)/729 = (-8232)/729,



---------------

Second term: -392/81 = -3528/729,

Third term: 392/9 = (392*81)/729 = 31752/729,

Fourth term: 40 = (40*729)/729 =29160/729.

Adding

---------------

 all terms over 729:

[ -8232 -3528 +31752 +29160 ] /729.

Compute numerator:

-8232 -3528 = -11760,

31752 +29160 =60912,

Total: -11760 +60912=49152.

Thus f

---------------

(-7/9)=49152/729= divide numerator and denominator by 9:

49152 ÷9=5461.333… Wait

---------------

, 729=9^3, 49152 ÷ 9=5461.333?

---------------

 Wait maybe better to divide numerator and denominator by 9:

49152 ÷9= 5461.333...

---------------

 Hmm, but let me see:

Wait 49152 divided by 729:

729 ×

---------------

 67 = 729×60=43740, 729×7=5103, total 43740+5103=48843.

4

---------------

9152 -48843=309.

So 67 + 309/729 �

---------------

�67.424.

Thus, f(-7/9)=67.424.

Compare to f(-1)=64,

---------------

 so the maximum occurs at x=-7/9≈-0.7778, giving f(x)= ~67.424.

Thus the maximum of the expression inside the square root is approximately

---------------

 67.424, so the maximum |f(z)| is sqrt(67.424)≈8.21.



---------------

Wait, but this is higher than the 8 we found earlier. So this suggests that the maximum is actually around 8.21, which would be expressed

---------------

 as m√3 /n.

Wait, let me compute the exact value.

At x=-7/9, the value of f(x)=24x³ -8x² -56x +40 was

---------------

 49152/729.

Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 9:

49152 ÷9 =5461.333…

---------------

, 729 ÷9=81,

Wait 49152 ÷ 9:

9×5461=49149, so remainder 3,

---------------

 so 5461 and 3/9, so 5461.333...

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 49152/729 = (49152 ÷ 3)/(729 ÷3)=16384/243.



---------------

Hmm, 243 ×67= 16281, 16384-16281=103, so 67 +103/243 �

---------------

�67.4238.

So sqrt(16384/243)= sqrt(16384)/sqrt(243)= 128/(9√3)= (128√3)/(9×3)=1

---------------

28√3/27? Wait let me see:

Wait sqrt(243)=sqrt(81×3)=9√3,

Thus

---------------

 sqrt(16384/243)=sqrt(16384)/sqrt(243)=128/(9√3)= (128√3)/(9×3)=1

---------------

28√3/27? Wait no:

Wait sqrt(16384)=128,

sqrt(243)=9√3,

Therefore

---------------

 sqrt(16384/243)=128/(9√3).

Rationalizing the denominator:

128/(9√3) = (128√3)/(9×3)=128√3/27.

Therefore

---------------

 the maximum |f(z)| is 128√3 /27.

Wait but 128 divided by 27 is

---------------

 approximately 4.7407, and multiplied by √3≈2.828 gives about 4.7407×2.828≈13.4, but that

---------------

 contradicts previous approximate value of ~8.21.

Wait, there's a mistake here. Wait, the expression inside the square root was (2-2x)(20 -8x -12x²)= f

---------------

(x)=24x³ -8x² -56x +40,

At x=-7/9, this

---------------

 evaluates to 49152/729≈67.424,

so the square root is sqrt(67.424)≈8.21,

But

---------------

 according to the exact value:

128/(9√3)=128/(9*1.732)≈128/(15.588)≈8.21,

Yes

---------------

, that's correct. So the exact value is 128√3/(9*3)=?

Wait no, sqrt

---------------

(16384/243)= sqrt(16384)/sqrt(243)=128/(9√3)= (128√3)/(9*3)=1

---------------

28√3/27≈(128/27)*1.732≈4.74*1.732≈8.21.

Yes

---------------

, so the exact maximum value is 128√3 / 27?

Wait, let me recheck the calculation

---------------

:

The expression inside was f(x)=24x³ -8x² -56x +40 evaluated at x=-7/9 gives

---------------

 49152/729.

But 49152 divided by 729:

Let

---------------

 me compute 729×67=729*(60+7)=43740 +5103=48843,

49152-48843=309,

Thus

---------------

 49152/729=67 + 309/729=67 + 103/243.



---------------

But 24x³ -8x² -56x +40 at x=-7/9:

2

---------------

4*(-343/729) -8*(49/81) -56*(-7/9) +40.

Compute

---------------

 term by term:

First term: 24*(-343)/729 = (-8232)/729,

Second term: -8*(49)/81 = (-392)/81 = (-392*9)/729 = (-3528)/729,

Third term: -56*(-7)/9 = (392)/9 = (392*81)/729 = (31752)/729,

Fourth term:40 = (40*729)/729 =29160/729,

Adding

---------------

 all together:

(-8232 -3528 +31752 +29160)/729,

Compute

---------------

 numerator:

-8232 -3528 = -11760,

31752 +29160 = 60912,

Total numerator: -11760 +60912=49152,

Yes

---------------

, so 49152/729= 49152 divided by 729.



---------------

Now sqrt(49152/729)=sqrt(49152)/sqrt(729)=sqrt(49152)/27.

Compute

---------------

 sqrt(49152):

49152 divided by 64= 768.

Thus

---------------

 sqrt(49152)=sqrt(64×768)=8×sqrt(768).

sqrt(768)=sqrt(256×3)=16√3,

Thus sqrt(49152)=8×16√3=128√3,

Therefore sqrt(49152/729)=128√3 /27.

Thus

---------------

 the maximum |f(z)| is 128√3 /27.

Therefore, the answer is 128√3 /27, so m=128, n=27, m

---------------

 +n=155.

Wait, but let me confirm that this is indeed the maximum.

Earlier, at x=-1, which

---------------

 corresponds to z=-1, we had f(x)= (2-2x)(20 -8x -12x²) evaluated

---------------

 at x=-1 is:

2-2*(-1)=4,

20 -8*(-1) -12*(1)=20+8-12=16,

so

---------------

 4*16=64, so sqrt(64)=8, which matches.

At x=-7/9, we

---------------

 get sqrt(49152/729)=128√3/27≈8.21, which is higher.

Therefore the maximum is indeed 128√3/27, so m=128, n=27, so

---------------

 m +n=155.

Therefore the answer is 155.

But let me check if 128 and27 have common factors. 128 is 2^7, 27 is 3^3, so no common factors. Thus the

---------------

 fraction is reduced.

Hence the answer is 155.

**Final Answer**
Answer: 155


Given a complex number \( z \) with \( |z| = 1 \), we need to find the maximum value of \( |z^3 + z^2 - 5z + 3| \). The answer should be in the form \( \frac{m \sqrt{3}}{n} \), and we need to find \( m + n \).

First, we note that \( z \) lies on the unit circle, so we can write \( z = e^{i\theta} \). We then

---------------

 express the polynomial \( f(z) = z^3 + z^2 - 5z + 3 \) in terms of trigonometric functions and find

---------------

 its modulus. 

By factoring the polynomial, we find \( f(z) = (z - 1)(z^2 + 2z - 3) \). We then need

---------------

 to maximize the product of the moduli \( |z - 1| \) and \( |z^2 + 2z - 3| \).

Using

---------------

 trigonometric identities and substitutions, we convert the problem into a function of \( x = \cos\theta \). After expanding and simplifying, we find the expression to maximize is \( (2 - 2x)(20 - 8x - 12x^2) \).

Solving the cubic equation derived from setting

---------------

 the derivative to zero, we find critical points at \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -\frac{7}{9} \). Evaluating the function at these points and endpoints, we find the maximum value occurs at \( x = -\frac{7}{9} \).

The maximum value of \( |z^3 + z^2 - 5z + 3| \) is found to be \( \frac{128\sqrt{3}}{27} \). Thus, \( m = 128 \) and \( n = 27 \), leading to \( m + n = 155 \).

\boxed{155}
