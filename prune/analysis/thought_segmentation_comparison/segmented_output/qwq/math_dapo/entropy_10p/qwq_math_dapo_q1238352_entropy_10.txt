Okay, so I have this problem here: "Find the number of 9-dimensional sub-subfaces in a 12-dimensional cube." Hmm, let me try

---------------

 to parse that. First, I know that in a cube, the faces, edges, and vertices are all lower-dimensional components. The problem mentions "

---------------

sub-subfaces," which I think refers to faces of a certain dimension in a higher-dimensional cube. The question is specifically asking about 9-dimensional sub-subfaces in a 12-dimensional cube. 

Let me start by recalling some basics about hypercubes. In a standard

---------------

 n-dimensional cube, often called an n-cube, the number of k-dimensional faces (or k-faces) can be calculated using a formula. I remember that the formula is something like combinations multiplied by 2 to some power. Let me see if I can remember the

---------------

 exact formula.

From what I recall, the number of k-dimensional faces in an n-cube is given by the binomial coefficient C(n, k) multiplied by 2^(n - k). So, the formula would be:

Number of k-faces = C(n, k) * 2^(n - k)

Let me verify this with the example given in the problem. For a 3-dimensional cube (n

---------------

=3), the number of 2-dimensional faces (faces) should be 6. Plugging into the formula: C(3,2)*2^(3-2) = 3 * 2 = 6, which matches. The edges (1-dimensional) would be C(3,1)*2^(3-1) = 3 * 4 = 12, which is correct. The vertices (0-dimensional) are C(3,0)*2^(3-0) = 1*8=8, which is also correct. Okay, so the formula seems to hold.

Therefore, applying this formula to the problem's

---------------

 case: we need the number of 9-dimensional faces (k=9) in a 12-dimensional cube (n=12). So plugging into the formula:

Number of 9-faces = C(12, 9) * 2^(12 - 9)

First, let's compute C(12, 9). But wait, combinations have the property that C(n, k) = C(n, n - k). Since 12 - 9 = 3, so C(12,9) is equal to C(12,3). That might be easier to compute. Let me compute

---------------

 C(12,3):

C(12,3) = 12! / (3! * (12 - 3)!) = (12 × 11 × 10) / (3 × 2 × 1) = (1320) / 6 = 220.

Then, 2^(12 - 9) = 2^3 = 8.

Multiplying those together: 220 * 8 = 1760.

Wait, but

---------------

 let me check again. The problem mentions "sub-subfaces". Is there a chance that "sub-subface" refers to something different? The

---------------

 problem might be using "subface" as a term, and "sub-subface" as a 2-step down? Hmm

---------------

. Let me think again.

In the problem statement, they mention that in a 3D cube, the 2D faces are called faces, the 1D are edges, and 0D vertices. So in

---------------

 general, a k-face is a k-dimensional face. So a 9-dimensional subface of a 12-dimensional cube would just be a 9-face of the 12-cube. The term "sub-subface" might just be emphasizing that it's a lower-dimensional face, but perhaps

---------------

 it's redundant. Since they specified "9-dimensional," I think it's safe to proceed with the formula.

Alternatively, maybe "sub-subface" is a term they

---------------

 defined? Let me check the problem again. The problem says "the familiar 3-dimensional cube has 6 2-dimensional faces, 12 1-dimensional edges, and 8 0-dimensional vertices. Find the number of 9-dimensional sub-subfaces in a 12-dimensional cube." So

---------------

 in their terminology, maybe "sub-face" is a face of lower dimension, so "sub-subface" is two levels down? Wait, but in

---------------

 the 3D cube, the 2D faces are just called faces, the 1D edges are subfaces, and 0D vertices are sub-subfaces? But

---------------

 the problem says "sub-subfaces" for the 9-dimensional in 12. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps they just use "sub-subface" as a way to say "face of a face,"

---------------

 but that's not standard terminology. Maybe it's a typo or a misnomer, but given that they specify 9-dimensional, it

---------------

's likely just a 9-face. So I think proceeding with the formula is correct.

So according to the formula, it should be 220 * 8 = 1760. Let me check

---------------

 my calculation again.

C(12,9) = C(12,3) = (12 × 11 × 10)/(3 × 2 × 1). 12 divided by 3 is 4, so 4 × 11 × 10 / 2 × 1? Wait, no

---------------

, let me compute step by step:

12 × 11 = 132; 132 × 10 = 1320. Divided by 6 (since 3! is 6). 1320 divided by 6: 1320 / 6 is indeed 220. Then 2^(12-9) is 8, so 220 × 8.

---------------

 200 × 8 is 1600, and 20 × 8 is 160, so total 1760. That seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to think about the

---------------

 formula. Let me recall how the formula is derived. For an n-cube, each k-face is determined by choosing a subset of k coordinates to "fix" and the

---------------

 remaining n - k coordinates to vary. But actually, more precisely, each k-face is determined by choosing which n - k coordinates are fixed to a particular binary value (0 or 1). Wait, actually, the

---------------

 way to think about it is: to specify a k-face, you have to choose which n - k coordinates are fixed. For each coordinate you fix, you can fix it to either 0 or 1. Wait

---------------

, but actually, no. Let me recall the exact derivation.

In an n-dimensional hypercube, the number of k-dimensional faces can be thought of as follows: To get

---------------

 a k-face, you need to fix (n - k) coordinates. Each coordinate you fix can be fixed to either 0 or 1. However, the number of ways to choose which coordinates to fix is C(n, n - k) = C(n, k). Wait, actually

---------------

, it's C(n, n - k) to choose which coordinates to fix, and then for each of those coordinates, you have 2 choices (0 or 1). Therefore, the total number is C(n, n - k) * 2^{n - k} = C(n, k) * 2^{n -k}, which matches the formula I

---------------

 had before. So that seems consistent.

Therefore, the formula is correct. Therefore, applying it here, the number of 9-dimensional faces in a 12-dimensional cube is C(12,9)*2^(3) = 220 * 8 = 1760. 

Wait

---------------

, but let me think again: for each set of coordinates you fix, you can fix them to 0 or 1. So

---------------

 for each of the (n - k) coordinates you fix, you have 2 options. Therefore, the total number is C(n, n -k) * 2^{n -k} = C(n,k)*2^{n -k}. So

---------------

 yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, another way to think: in the 3D cube, the 2D faces: you

---------------

 fix 1 coordinate (since 3 - 2 =1). The number of coordinates you can fix is 3 (each

---------------

 axis), and for each, you can fix it to 0 or 1. So 3 * 2 =6, which matches. Similarly edges (1D): fix 2 coordinates, so C(3,2)=3, times 2^2=4, gives

---------------

 12, which is correct. Vertices: fix all 3 coordinates, so C(3,3)=1, times 2^3=8, which is right. So the

---------------

 formula works here. 

Therefore, I think my calculation is correct. 12 choose 9 is 220, times 8 gives 1760. So

---------------

 the answer should be 1760. 

Wait, but let me check with another example. Let's take a 4D hypercube. How many 2D faces does it have? Using the formula, C(4,2)*2^(4-2)=6*4=24. Let

---------------

 me see if that's correct. A tesseract has 24 square faces, yes. Because each original cube in the 3D cells contributes its faces, but I

---------------

 might need to count differently. Alternatively, each square face in the tesseract can be thought of as choosing 2 coordinates to vary and fixing the other 2. For

---------------

 each pair of coordinates, there are 2^2=4 possibilities for the fixed coordinates, but maybe? Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 better to trust the formula here since the example checks out. 

Therefore, I think my answer of 1760 is correct. 



---------------

Wait, but the problem says "sub-subfaces". Maybe that term is a hint? Let me see. In the problem statement, they

---------------

 list the 2D faces as "faces", the 1D as edges, 0D as vertices. So in

---------------

 3D, the 2D faces are the main faces, edges are 1D, vertices 0D. Maybe

---------------

 "subface" is a face of lower dimension? So a subface of a face would be an edge, and a sub-subface would be a vertex? But in that case, in

---------------

 3D, the sub-subfaces would be vertices, which are 0-dimensional, so in 12D, a 9-dimensional sub-subface might mean

---------------

 two levels down from 12? That would be 12 - 2 = 10? Wait, that

---------------

 doesn't align. Alternatively, maybe "sub-subface" is just their way of saying a face, regardless? Alternatively, perhaps the

---------------

 problem is using "subface" as a face of any lower dimension, so "sub-subface" is a face of a face? Then

---------------

 a 9-dimensional sub-subface would be a 9-face that is a face of some higher-dimensional face. But that

---------------

 complicates things, but actually, the total number of 9-faces in the 12-cube is the same regardless of how they're arranged

---------------

, so maybe that's not necessary. 

Alternatively, perhaps "sub-subface" is just emphasizing that it's a face of a face of the original cube, but that

---------------

 would still be the same as a face of the cube. Since every face is a face of the cube, regardless of how

---------------

 you get there. So I think the problem is just asking for the number of 9-dimensional faces in a 12-cube, so 1760 is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the

---------------

 terminology is different. Let me see, in some contexts, a "face" of a polytope is a subset of a certain dimension, so the

---------------

 term "subface" might refer to a face of a face. So a "sub-subface" would be a face of a face of a face. But in

---------------

 that case, the dimension would be lower. If you start with a 12-dimensional cube, then a face of it is a face of dimension from 0 to 12. A subface (face of a face) could be even

---------------

 lower. But the problem specifies that it's a 9-dimensional sub-subface. So perhaps they want the number of 9-dimensional faces that are subfaces of some other

---------------

 face? But that's redundant because all 9-dimensional faces are subfaces of the 12-cube. Alternatively, maybe they

---------------

 mean something else. 

Alternatively, maybe "sub-subface" is a term they use for faces two dimensions lower? Like

---------------

 in the 3D cube, a face is 2D, a subface (one dimension lower) is 1D (edges), and a sub-subface (two dimensions lower) would be 0D (vertices). So following that, in a 12D cube, a subface would be 11D, and a sub-subface would be 10D? Wait, that contrad

---------------

icts. Wait, if in 3D, "subface" is edges (1D, one less), then "sub-subface" would be vertices (0D, two less). So in

---------------

 general, a "k-subface" would be (n -k)-dimensional. So a "subface" is 

---------------

1-subface, (n -1), and "sub-subface" is 2-subface, (n -2). Therefore

---------------

, if the problem is using that terminology, then a 9-dimensional sub-subface would require that 9 = n - 2, so n would be 11, but the cube is 12-dimensional. Wait, that might

---------------

 not fit. Alternatively, maybe "sub-subface" is a face two dimensions lower than the ambient cube. So in 12D, a subface would be 11D, sub-subface 10D, etc. But then the

---------------

 problem is asking for 9D, so that would be three steps down, so maybe "sub-sub-subface"? Hmm

---------------

, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just using "sub-subface" as a synonym for "face", so

---------------

 the question is straightforward. Since they gave an example where 2D faces are called faces, 1D edges, 0D vertices, then

---------------

 in 12D, a 9D face is just a 9-face, so the answer is 1760. 

Alternatively, maybe I

---------------

 should confirm with another approach. Let me see if there's a recursive formula for the number of faces. The number of k-faces in an n-cube can also be thought of as 2 times the number of k-faces in an (n-1)-cube plus the number of (k-1)-faces in an (n-1)-cube. The

---------------

 recursion is F(n, k) = 2*F(n-1, k) + F(n-1, k-1). Let me see if that works with the 3D example. 

For example, let

---------------

's compute F(3,2). Using the recursion:

F(3,2) = 2*F(2,2) + F(2,1). 

F(2,2) is the number of 2-faces in a 2-cube (a square), which is 1. F(2,1) is 4 (the edges of the square). Therefore, F(3,2)=2*1 +4=6, which is correct. 

Similarly, let's compute F(3,1):

F(3,1)=2*F(2,1)+F(2,0). F(2,1)=4 edges, F(2,0)=4 vertices. So 2*4 +4=12, which matches. 

So

---------------

 this recursion works. Let me try to compute F(12,9) using this recursion, but that might take a while. Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 I can compute it step by step for lower n and see if the formula still holds. 

Alternatively, let me check the

---------------

 formula again with another example. Let's take n=4 (tesseract), k=1 (edges). The number should be 32. Let

---------------

's see:

C(4,1)*2^(4-1)=4 * 8=32. Correct. 



---------------

Alternatively, using the recursion: F(4,1)=2*F(3,1)+F(3,0)=2*12 +8=24+8=32. Correct. 

So

---------------

 the formula holds. 

Therefore, I think the formula is reliable. 

Therefore, I think the answer is 1760. 



---------------

Wait, but let me compute it once again step by step to be absolutely sure. 

First, n=12, k=9. 

C(12,9)=C(12,3)= (12×11×10)/(3×2×1)= (1320)/6=220. 

Then, 2^(12-9)=2^3=8. 

220×8: 200×8=1600, 20×8=160, so total 1760. 

Yes. 

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 the problem is a trick question? For example, if "sub-subface" refers to something else. But since the problem mentions

---------------

 "the familiar 3-dimensional cube has 6 2-dimensional faces, 12 1-dimensional edges, and 8 0-dimensional vertices," so

---------------

 they are clearly using the standard terminology where the k-dimensional faces are called k-faces, so 0-faces are vertices, 1-faces edges, etc. So

---------------

 a 9-dimensional sub-subface is just a 9-face. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using "sub-subface" to mean a face that is two dimensions lower than the cube? But

---------------

 in the 3D cube, a "subface" would be 2-1=1D (edges), and a "sub-subface" would be 0D (vertices). So in a

---------------

 12D cube, a "subface" would be 11D, a "sub-subface" would be 10D, but the problem is asking for 9D. So

---------------

 that would be a "sub-sub-subface". Since the problem says "sub-subface", that would be 10D. Hmm

---------------

, so maybe there's a terminology mismatch here?

Alternatively, perhaps "sub-face" is one level down, so "sub-subface" is two levels down. So

---------------

 starting from 12D, two levels down is 10D, but the problem asks for 9D, which would be three levels down, so "sub-sub-subface". So

---------------

 maybe the problem has a typo? Alternatively, maybe the question is correct and "sub-subface" is just their way of saying "face", so

---------------

 9D face. Since the problem statement gives an example where the 2D faces are called faces, edges, vertices, so

---------------

 the terminology is standard. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is from a source that uses "subface" as a proper subset, but in comb

---------------

inatorial terms, a face is a subset, so a subface would just be a face of lower dimension. But again

---------------

, the problem specifies the dimension. 

Given that the problem explicitly mentions "9-dimensional", I think the answer is indeed 1760, so I will go with that. 

**Final Answer**
Answer: 1760


To find the number of 9-dimensional sub-subfaces in a 12-dimensional cube, we use the formula for the number of k-dimensional faces in an n-dimensional cube, which is given by:

\[
\text{Number of } k\text{-faces} = \binom{n}{k} \times 2^{n - k}
\]

Here, \( n = 12 \) and \( k = 9 \). 

First, we calculate the binomial coefficient \( \binom{12}{9} \). Using the property of combinations, \( \binom{12}{9} = \binom{12}{3} \):

\[
\binom{12}{3} = \frac{12 \times 11 \times 10}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{1320}{6} = 220
\]

Next, we calculate \( 2^{12 - 9} \):

\[
2^{12 - 9} = 2^3 = 8
\]

Multiplying these results together gives the number of 9-dimensional faces:

\[
220 \times 8 = 1760
\]

Thus, the number of 9-dimensional sub-subfaces in a 12-dimensional cube is \(\boxed{1760}\).
