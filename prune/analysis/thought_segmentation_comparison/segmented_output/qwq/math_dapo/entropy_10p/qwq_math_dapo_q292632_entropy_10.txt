Okay, so I have this problem here: Let x be equal to 4 divided by all these terms involving roots of 5, and

---------------

 then I need to find (x + 1) raised to the 48th power. Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but maybe there's a pattern or a trick to simplify it. Let me start

---------------

 by writing down what x is exactly:

x = 4 / [(√5 + 1)(∛√5 + 1)(∜√5 + 1)... Wait, actually, hold on. Let me check the ex

---------------

ponents again. The problem says:

x = 4 / [ (√5 +1)(⁴√5 +1)(⁸√5 +1)(¹⁶√5 +1) ]

Wait, the

---------------

 denominators are the square root of 5 plus 1, then the fourth root of 5 plus 1, eighth root, and sixteenth root? Let me confirm:



---------------

Yes, the denominators are (√5 +1), (∛√5? Wait, no, actually, the notation

---------------

 might be different. Let me parse the original problem again:

The problem states: (sqrt{5}+1)(sqrt[4]{5}+1)(sqrt[8]{5}+1)(sqrt[16]{5}+1). So each

---------------

 term is the nth root of 5 plus 1, where n is 2, 4, 8, 16. So the

---------------

 denominators are the square root, fourth root, eighth root, and sixteenth root of 5, each plus 1. 



---------------

So the denominators are:

First term: √5 + 1 (which is 5^(1/2) +1)

Second term: ⁴√5 +1 (5^(1/4) +1)

Third term: ⁸√5 +1 (5^(1/8) +1)

Fourth term: ¹⁶√5 +1 (5^(1/16) +1)

So,

---------------

 the denominator is a product of four terms, each of which is a root of 5 (with exponents 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16) plus 1. 



---------------

Hmm, so maybe there's a telescoping product here? Since each exponent is a power of 2, and the ex

---------------

ponents are decreasing by a factor of 2 each time. That seems like a pattern where multiplying terms might lead to simplification when

---------------

 considering exponents. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can rationalize the denominator step by step. Let me think. 

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 there's a way to write this product as part of a geometric series or some telescoping product. Let me try to see

---------------

.

Alternatively, perhaps if I let y = sqrt[16]{5}, since 16 is the highest root here. Let me denote

---------------

 y = 5^(1/16). Then, each term can be expressed in terms of y:

First term: sqrt(5) +1 = 5^(1/2) +1 = (y^8) +1

Second term: fourth root of 5 +1 = 5^(1/4) +1 = y^4 +1

Third term: eighth root +1 = 5^(1/8) +1 = y^2 +1

Fourth term: sixteenth root +1 = y +1

Therefore, the denominator becomes (y^8 +1)(y^4 +1)(y^2 +1)(y +1). 

Hmm, so the

---------------

 denominator is (y + 1)(y^2 +1)(y^4 +1)(y^8 +1). 

Now

---------------

, this product looks familiar. I recall that the product (y -1)(y +1) = y^2 -1, and similarly, (y^2 +1)(y^2 -1) = y^4 -1, and so on. But

---------------

 here, all the terms are of the form (y^{2^k} +1). 

Wait, actually, if I multiply (y -1) times the entire denominator, then

---------------

:

(y -1)(y +1)(y^2 +1)(y^4 +1)(y^8 +1) = (y^2 -1)(y^2 +1)(y^4 +1)(y^8 +1) 

Contin

---------------

uing this, each time multiplying the next term:

(y^4 -1)(y^4 +1)(y^8 +1) = (y^8 -1)(y^8 +1) = y^{16} -1

Therefore, if

---------------

 we have (y -1) multiplied by the denominator, which is (y +1)(y^2 +1)...(y^8 +1), the

---------------

 product is y^{16} -1. 

Therefore, the denominator D = [(y^{16} -1)/(y -1)]. Since

---------------

 D = (y +1)(y^2 +1)...(y^8 +1) = (y^{16} -1)/(y -1). 

Therefore, the

---------------

 denominator is (y^{16} -1)/(y -1). 

Therefore, x = 4 / [ (y^{16} -1)/(y -1) ) ] = 4*(y -1)/(y^{16} -1). 

But since y = 5^{1/16}, so y^{16} = 5. Therefore, substituting back:

x = 4*(y -1)/(5 -1) = 4*(y -1)/4 = (y -1). 

Wait

---------------

, that's a big simplification! So x = y -1, where y =5^{1/16}. 

So x = 5^{1/16} -1. 

Therefore, x +1 = 5^{1/16}. 

Therefore

---------------

, (x +1)^{48} = (5^{1/16})^{48} =5^{48/16}=5^{3}=125. 

Wait, so

---------------

 that's it? Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't skip anything. 

Starting from the denominator:



---------------

Denominator D = (y +1)(y^2 +1)(y^4 +1)(y^8 +1). 

Multiply both sides by (y -1):

(y -1)D = (y -1)(y +1)(y^2 +1)... =

---------------

 (y^2 -1)(y^2 +1)... which telescopes up to (y^{16} -1). 

Thus, D = (y^{16} -1)/(y -1). 

Then x = 4/D = 4*(y -1)/(y^{16} -1). 

But y^{16} is 5, since y =5^{1/16}, so substit

---------------

uting:

x =4*(y -1)/(5 -1)= (4*(y-1))/4 = y -1. 

Thus, x +1 = y =5^{1/16}. 

Then (x +1)^48 = (5^{1/16})^48 =5^{48/16}=5^3=125. 

That

---------------

 seems correct. Let me check with actual numbers to verify.

Let me compute the denominator numerically, then compute x, then (x +1)^48 and

---------------

 see if it's 125.

First, compute each term:

First term: sqrt(5) +1 ≈ 2.236 +1 ≈3.236

Second term: 4th root of 5:

---------------

 5^(1/4) ≈ 1.495, so +1 ≈2.495

Third term: 8th root of 5: 5^(1/8) ≈1.1746, so +1 ≈2.1746

Fourth term: 16th root of 5: 5^(1/16) ≈1.05

---------------

9, so +1 ≈2.059

Multiply all these denominators together:

3.236 *2.495 ≈ let

---------------

's see, 3*2.495≈7.485, plus 0.236*2.495≈0.236*2.5≈0.59, so total approx 8.075

Then multiply by 2.1746: 8.075 *2.1746 ≈8

---------------

*2.17≈17.36 plus 0.075*2.17≈0.163, so �

---------------

�17.523

Then multiply by 2.059: 17.523 *2.059 ≈17*2.059≈35.00,

---------------

 plus 0.523*2.059≈1.077, so total ≈36.077

So denominator ≈36.077

Then

---------------

 x =4 /36.077≈0.1108

Then x +1≈1.1108

Now compute (1.1108)^48. Hmm, that

---------------

's going to be a bit tedious, but let's see:

First, note that 5^(1/16) is 

---------------

5^(0.0625). Let me compute 5^(1/16):

Take natural log: ln(5) ≈1.6094, so ln(5)/16≈0.1006, so exp(0.1006)≈1.1058. Wait

---------------

, so 5^(1/16)≈1.1058. But according to my previous approximate calculation, x +1≈1.1108, which is close but a bit off. Hmm

---------------

, maybe my approximations are rough.

Wait, let's recalculate the denominator more accurately.

First term: sqrt(5) = approx 2.2360679775

+

---------------

1 = 3.2360679775

Second term: 5^(1/4). Let's compute 5^(1/4):

sqrt(sqrt(5)) = sqrt(2.2360679775) ≈1.4953487812

+1 = 2.4953487812

Third term: 5^(1/8) = sqrt(5^(1/4)) = sqrt(1.4953487812) ≈1.2223924214

---------------



Wait, wait, hold on. Wait, 5^(1/8) is the eighth root. Wait, sqrt

---------------

(sqrt(sqrt(5)))? Wait, no. Let me do it step by step.

Wait, 5^(1/8) is the

---------------

 eighth root. Let me compute 5^(1/4) first, which is approx 1.4953487812.

---------------

 Then 5^(1/8) is the square root of that, so sqrt(1.4953487812) ≈1.2223924214.

---------------

 So adding 1 gives 2.2223924214.

Wait, so my earlier calculation was wrong here. I

---------------

 thought it was 2.17, but actually it's about 2.2224.

Fourth term: 5^(1/16) is the square root of 5^(1/8). So sqrt(1.2223924214)≈1.105542

---------------

156, plus 1 is 2.105542156.

So now let's recalculate the denominator with

---------------

 more accurate terms:

First term: 3.2360679775

Second term: 2.4953487812

Third term: 2.2223924214

Fourth term: 2.105542156

Multiply step

---------------

 by step:

First, multiply first two terms: 3.2360679775 *2.4953487812 ≈



---------------

Let me compute 3 *2.495 ≈7.485, plus 0.2360679775 *2.495 ≈0

---------------

.236*2.495≈0.589. So total ≈8.074.



---------------

But precise calculation:

3.2360679775 * 2.4953487812:

Let

---------------

 me compute 3 *2.4953487812 =7.4860463436

0.2360679775 *2.4953487812 ≈0.236068 *2.495348 ≈approx

---------------

 0.236068*2=0.4721, 0.236068*0.4953≈0.117, so total≈0.5891

---------------

.

Thus total first two terms: ~7.486 +0.5891≈8.0751.

Third

---------------

 term is 2.2223924214. Multiply 8.0751 *2.2223924214:

Compute

---------------

 8 *2.22239 ≈17.7791, 0.0751*2.22239≈0.1668, so total≈17.7791 +0.1668≈17.9459.

Fourth term is 2.105542156. Multiply 17.9459 *2.105542156.

Compute

---------------

 17 *2.1055 ≈35.7935, 0.9459*2.1055≈~

---------------

2.0 (approx 0.9459*2=1.8918, 0.9459*0.1055≈0.0998, total≈1.9916). So total ≈35.7935+1.9916≈37.7851.

So the denominator is approximately 37.7851. Then

---------------

 x =4 /37.7851≈0.1058.

Therefore x+1≈1.1058.

Now, 5^(1/16) is exactly

---------------

 the term we had earlier, which is approx 1.105542156. So x+1 is approximately

---------------

 1.1058, very close to that. The slight discrepancy is due to rounding errors in the multiplication steps.

Therefore, (x +1)^48 ≈(1.105542156)^48. Let's compute that.



---------------

But since 5^(1/16) raised to 48 is 5^(48/16)=5^3=125. Exactly. So despite

---------------

 the approximate calculations, the exact value is 125. Therefore, the answer should be 125.

Therefore

---------------

, I think my steps are correct, and the answer is 125.

**Final Answer**
Answer: 125


Let \( x = \frac{4}{(\sqrt{5}+1)(\sqrt[4]{5}+1)(\sqrt[8]{5}+1)(\sqrt[16]{5}+1)} \). We need to find \((x + 1)^{48}\).

First, we express each term in the denominator using a common variable. Let \( y = 5^{1/16} \). Then:
- \( \sqrt{5} = y^8 \)
- \( \sqrt[4]{5} = y^4 \)
- \( \sqrt[8]{5} = y^2 \)
- \( \sqrt[16]{5} = y \)

Thus, the denominator becomes:
\[
(y^8 + 1)(y^4 + 1)(y^2 + 1)(y + 1)
\]

We recognize this product as part of a telescoping product. Multiplying by \( y - 1 \), we get:
\[
(y - 1)(y + 1)(y^2 + 1)(y^4 + 1)(y^8 + 1) = y^{16} - 1
\]

Therefore, the denominator \( D \) can be written as:
\[
D = \frac{y^{16} - 1}{y - 1}
\]

Substituting back into the expression for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{4}{D} = \frac{4(y - 1)}{y^{16} - 1}
\]

Since \( y^{16} = 5 \), we have:
\[
x = \frac{4(y - 1)}{5 - 1} = \frac{4(y - 1)}{4} = y - 1
\]

Thus, \( x + 1 = y \). Since \( y = 5^{1/16} \), we get:
\[
(x + 1)^{48} = \left(5^{1/16}\right)^{48} = 5^{48/16} = 5^3 = 125
\]
