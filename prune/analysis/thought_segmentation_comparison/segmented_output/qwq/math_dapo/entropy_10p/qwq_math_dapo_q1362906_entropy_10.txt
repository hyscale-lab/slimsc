Okay, so I need to figure out how many ordered quadruples (a, b, c, d) of positive integers satisfy the equation a! * b! * c! * d! = 24!. Hmm, factor

---------------

ials can get pretty big, so maybe there's a way to break this down using prime factors?

First, let me recall that factorials can be expressed

---------------

 as products of primes. Maybe if I factorize 24! into its prime components, then the product a!b!c!d! must have exactly those exponents for each prime. That

---------------

 sounds like a plan. Let me try that.

First, I need to find the prime factorization of 24!. The primes up to 24 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23. For

---------------

 each of these, I need to find their exponents in 24!.

Starting with 2:

The exponent of 2 in 24! is floor(24/2) + floor(24/4) + floor(24/8) + floor(24/16) + floor(24/32) = 12 + 6 + 3 + 1 + 0 = 22.

Similarly for 3:

floor(24/3) + floor(24/9) + floor(24/27) = 8 + 2 + 0 = 10.

5:

floor(24/5) + floor(24/25) = 4 + 0 = 4.

7:

floor(24/7) + floor(24/49) = 3 + 0 = 3.

11:

floor(24/11) = 2.

13:

floor(24/13) = 1.

17:

floor(24/17) = 1.

19:

floor(24/19) = 1.

23:

floor(24/23) = 1.

So the prime factorization of 24! is 2^22 * 3^10 * 5^4 * 7^3 * 11^2 * 13^1 * 17^1 * 19^1 * 23^1.

Now, the product a!b!c!d! must equal this. Each

---------------

 of a!, b!, c!, d! is a factorial, so their prime exponents must add up to the exponents in 24!.

Therefore

---------------

, for each prime p, the sum of exponents of p in a!, b!, c!, d! must equal the exponent in 24!.

This

---------------

 seems complicated because there are multiple primes involved. Maybe there's a way to approach this by considering the exponents of each prime separately, and then multiplying

---------------

 the number of solutions for each prime?

Wait, but actually, the exponents of different primes are not independent because the factorials are

---------------

 interdependent. For example, the exponent of 2 in a! is related to the exponent of 3 in a! because they

---------------

 both depend on the same factorial. Hmm, so maybe this complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a way to model

---------------

 this problem by considering the sizes of a, b, c, d. Since factorials grow so quickly, the numbers a, b, c, d can't be too large. Since

---------------

 24! is the product, each of a, b, c, d must be less than or equal to 24. But

---------------

 actually, they can be equal to 24, but maybe not all of them can be too big.

Alternatively, maybe the

---------------

 problem is similar to partitioning the number 24 into four integers a, b, c, d such that their factorials multiply to 24!? But that

---------------

 might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of this as a problem where each of a, b, c, d must be between

---------------

 1 and 24, and the product of their factorials equals 24!.

Alternatively, maybe the key is that the

---------------

 maximum of a, b, c, d must be 24, because otherwise, if all of them are less than 24, their factorials would multiply to something less than 24!.

Wait, actually

---------------

, even if one of them is 24, then the product would have at least 24!, so if another

---------------

 factorial is multiplied, the product would be larger. Wait, that suggests that only one of them can be 24? Because

---------------

 if two of them are 24, then 24! * 24! would already be way larger than 24!.

Therefore

---------------

, exactly one of a, b, c, d must be 24, and the rest must be 1? But then

---------------

 the product would be 24! *1! *1! *1! =24! which works. But that

---------------

 would give 4 possibilities (since any one of the four positions can be 24). But maybe there are more possibilities where some

---------------

 of them are less than 24 but their product still multiplies to 24!.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. Suppose one

---------------

 of them is 24, and the others are 1, then yes, that works. Alternatively, maybe some of them can be 

---------------

23, but then 23! times something else would need to multiply to 24!.

Wait, 24! =24 *23! So if one

---------------

 of the factorials is 23!, then another factorial would have to be 24, but 24 is not a factorial of

---------------

 an integer. Wait, 24 is 4!, so maybe that could be a way?

Wait, 24! =23! *24, but 24 is 4!

---------------

 so 24! =23! *4! So then, if we have two factorials: 23! and 4! and the other two are

---------------

 1! then the product would be 23!*4!*1!*1! =24!.

So that gives another possibility

---------------

: one 23, one 4, and two 1's. So that would be 4 choose 1 (position for 23) times 3 choose 1 (position for 4), so 4*3=12 possibilities

---------------

. Hmm, so that's another 12. So now total 4 +12=16?

Wait, but maybe

---------------

 even more possibilities. Let me see. Let me think step by step.

Alternatively, maybe the problem can be approached by considering that the product a!b!c!d! =24! implies

---------------

 that the multiset {a, b, c, d} must include all the prime factors of 24!.

But perhaps

---------------

 the key is that the maximum among a,b,c,d must be exactly 24? Because if the maximum is less than 24, say 23, then the product would be at most (23!)^4, which is way larger than 24!.

Wait, actually, no

---------------

. Wait, 23! is smaller than 24!, so (23!)^4 would be much smaller than (24!)^4, but 

---------------

24! is much bigger than 23!.

Wait, actually, if all four numbers are less than 24, then the product of their factorials would be less

---------------

 than (24!)^4, but that's not helpful. Hmm, perhaps my initial thought was wrong.

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 the maximum among a, b, c, d must be 24. Otherwise, if all are less than 24, then each factorial is a divisor of 24!.



---------------

Wait, but 24! divided by the product of four smaller factorials must still be an integer? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 the problem requires that the product of the four factorials equals 24!.

So perhaps the way to think is that each

---------------

 of the four numbers a, b, c, d must be less than or equal to 24, and their factorials multiply to 24!.

So

---------------

, perhaps we can think in terms of partitioning 24 into four numbers where the product of their factorials is 24!.

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 the problem is similar to writing 24! as a product of four factorials, and counting the number of ordered quadruples.

This

---------------

 seems similar to factorizations into factorials, but ordered.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that the four

---------------

 numbers a, b, c, d must be such that when you multiply their factorials, you get 24!.

Let

---------------

 me think of possible cases where this can happen.

Case 1: One of them is 24, and the rest are 1. Then

---------------

 the product is 24! *1*1*1 =24!.

There are 4 such quadruples (each position can be the 24).

Case 2: One of them is 23, then we

---------------

 have 23! * something =24!.

Since 24! =24 *23!, so the

---------------

 remaining three factorials must multiply to 24. Since 24 is 4!.

So, the remaining three factorials must multiply to 4!.

Thus

---------------

, the product of three factorials is 4!.

Possible triples (since they are ordered, but let's first find unordered and then count

---------------

 permutations).

Factorials up to 4! are 1!,2!,3!,4!.

We need three factorials multiplying to 4!.

Possible options

---------------

:

- 4! *1! *1! =24*1*1=24. So that's one way

---------------

.

- 3! *2! *2! =6*2*2=24. Hmm, 6*2*2=24.

---------------

 Yes.

- 2! *2! *6 (but 6 isn't a factorial. Wait, 3! is 6, but 

---------------

3! *2! *2! is the second case.

Wait, 2! *2! *3! =2*2*6=24.

---------------

 That's the same as the second case.

Alternatively, 2! *3! *2!.

Alternatively, 4! *

---------------

1! *1!.

Alternatively, are there other combinations?

What about 1! *1! *24, but 24 is not a factorial except

---------------

 4!.

So, 24 can only be represented as 4!.

Alternatively, can we have 2! * 2! * 6, but 6 is 3!.

Wait, so

---------------

 the possible triples (unordered) are:

Either [4!,1!,1!] or [3!,2!,2!].

Therefore

---------------

, for the case where one of the numbers is 23, the remaining three factorials must be either (4!,1!,1!) or (3!,2!,2!).

So

---------------

 for each such case, how many ordered triples are there?

First case: [4!,1!,1!]. The number

---------------

 of ordered triples is 3 (since the 4! can be in any of the three positions, and the rest are 1!

---------------

s).

Second case: [3!,2!,2!]. The number of ordered triples is 3 (the 3! can be in any of the three positions, and the other two are 2!s).

Therefore, total ordered

---------------

 triples for this case: 3 +3 =6.

Since the 23 can be in any of the four positions, the

---------------

 total quadruples for this case would be 4 *6=24.

Wait, but hold on, in this case, the 

---------------

23 is fixed in one position, and the remaining three positions must multiply to 24. The three factorials can

---------------

 be arranged in 6 ways each? Wait, let me rephrase.

Suppose one of the quadruple elements is 23 (so

---------------

 23! is part of the product). The remaining three elements need to have factorials multiplying to 24,

---------------

 which is 4!.

So, the remaining three numbers (let's call them x,y,z) must satisfy x! y! z! =4!.

Possible

---------------

 triples (x,y,z):

Either (4,1,1), (1,4,1), (1,1,4),

---------------

 which are three permutations, or (3,2,2), (2,3,2), (2,2,3), which are three permutations. So total 6 ordered triples.

Hence, for each position of the 23, we have 6 ordered triples for the remaining three numbers, so total 4*6=24 quadruples here

---------------

.

Case 2 gives 24 quadruples.

Case 3: Suppose two of the numbers are 23 and 

---------------

2? Wait, but 23! *23! would already be way larger than 24!.

Wait, no

---------------

, actually, 23! *23! is way larger than 24!.

So, we can't have two numbers greater

---------------

 than or equal to 23. So, the maximum number of 23's is one?

Similarly, perhaps we

---------------

 can consider cases where one number is 22?

Wait, let's see. Let me see if there are more cases beyond

---------------

 case1 and case2.

Case3: Suppose one of the numbers is 22, then 22! *

---------------

 something =24!.

24! =24×23×22!.

So, the remaining three factorials must multiply to 24×23. But

---------------

 24×23 is 552. However, 552 must be the product of three factorials. Let's see if that's possible.

Factor

---------------

ials up to 5! (120) since 6! is 720 which is bigger than 552. Let's see:



---------------

Possible factorials: 1!,2!,3!,4!,5!.

Looking for three factorials whose product is 552.

First

---------------

, factorize 552: 552=8×69=8×3×23. Hmm, but 23 is prime. Since

---------------

 factorials can't have prime factors larger than themselves. Wait, but 23 is a prime factor here. So,

---------------

 since 23 is a prime, it must come from one of the factorials. Since 23 is in 23! and

---------------

 24!, but in the remaining factorials (the ones multiplying to 552), which are part of the product

---------------

. Wait, but 23 is a prime factor in 24! so if one of the factorials in the remaining three includes

---------------

 23, but since the maximum factorial here is 5! (since the original number was 22, so the

---------------

 other numbers can be up to 22? Wait, actually, the other numbers can be up to 24, but since

---------------

 we are in case3 where one is 22, but the others can be up to 24, but 

---------------

23 is allowed?

Wait, actually, in case3, if one of the numbers is 22, the other numbers can be anything from

---------------

 1 to 24, as long as their factorials multiply to 24×23. But since 23 is a prime factor, one

---------------

 of the other factorials must include 23, which requires that number to be at least 23. But then

---------------

, if one of them is 23, then we have 23! in the product. But then 22! *23! * ...

---------------

 would be way too big. Hmm, so maybe this is impossible?

Wait, let me recast.

If one of the numbers is 22, then the remaining three factorials must multiply to (24!)/(22!) =24×23×22! /22! =24×23=552.

So the

---------------

 product of three factorials must equal 552. Let's see if that's possible.

Looking at 552's

---------------

 prime factors: 552=2^3 *3*23. The primes 2,3,23.

Now

---------------

, the factorials in the product can only contribute primes up to their own value. Since 23 is a prime factor, one

---------------

 of the factorials must be at least 23. But 23 is a factorial of 23!? Wait

---------------

, 23 is a prime number, so 23! would include 23 as a factor, but 

---------------

23! is way too big (23! is about 2.5e22, but 552 is much

---------------

 smaller). So, the factorial that includes 23 must be exactly 23! but that's way too big. Wait

---------------

, but 23 is a prime, so the only factorial that can include 23 as a factor is 23! or higher, but 

---------------

23! is way larger than 552. Therefore, it's impossible to have a factorial contributing 23 as

---------------

 a factor in this product, since even 23! is too big.

Therefore, the product of three factorials cannot include 23 as a prime factor unless one of them is 23 or

---------------

 higher, which would make the factorial too big. Therefore, this case is impossible. So there are no quadruples where one of the numbers is 22.

Hmm

---------------

, so case3 is impossible.

Case4: Maybe one of the numbers is 21? Let's see.

Then, 21! multiplied

---------------

 by the rest must equal 24!.

24! /21! =24×23×22×21! /21! =24×23×22=24×506=12,144.

So the remaining three factorials must multiply to 12,144. Let's factorize 12,144.

1

---------------

2,144 divided by 24 is 506, but let me do prime factors:

12,144:

---------------

 divide by 2: 6072

Again by 2: 3036

Again by 2: 1518

Again by 2: 759

7

---------------

59 divided by 3: 253

253 divided by 11: 23. So 

---------------

253=11×23.

Therefore, 12,144=2^4 *3 *11 *23.

Again, primes

---------------

 2,3,11,23.

So, similar problem, we have primes like 23 again. To

---------------

 get 23 as a factor, we need a factorial that includes 23, which would have to be 23! or higher, but that

---------------

 would be way too big. 23! is way larger than 12,144, so even if we have

---------------

 23!, that would overshoot. So this case is also impossible.

Hmm, so maybe numbers less than 23 won

---------------

't work because of the prime 23? Because 23 is a prime factor in 24! and so

---------------

 to have it in the product of the four factorials, one of them must include 23 as a factor, which

---------------

 requires that number to be at least 23. So the only way to get the 23 factor is to have either a 23 or 24 in the quadruple.

Similarly

---------------

, the prime 19, 17, 13 are also primes in 24!, so similar logic applies.



---------------

Therefore, to include primes like 23, 19, etc., we need at least one of the numbers to be at least 

---------------

23, 19, etc. But since 23 is the largest prime in 24!, the only way to get 

---------------

23 in the product is to have either 23 or 24 in the quadruple.

Wait, so if

---------------

 there's a 24, then 24! includes all the primes up to 24, so that's

---------------

 okay. If there's a 23, then 23! includes primes up to 23, which includes

---------------

 19,17,13, etc. So, if there's a 23, then we need

---------------

 to account for the remaining primes. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the key is that either there is a 24, or there is a 23 and a

---------------

 24's worth of other primes?

Hmm, maybe this is getting too convoluted. Let me try to structure

---------------

 the problem.

Let me think that the quadruple must contain either a 24 or a 23 (or both?

---------------

 Wait, but if you have both 24 and 23, then their factorials would multiply to 24! *23! which is way too

---------------

 big. So no, can't have both.

So the quadruple must contain exactly one of 24 or 23,

---------------

 or maybe neither, but as we saw earlier, primes like 23 require at least one of the factorials to include

---------------

 it, so you need at least one of the numbers to be at least 23. So you must have either 23 or 24.

Therefore

---------------

, the quadruple must have either a 24 or a 23 (but not both). So there are two main cases: quadr

---------------

uples with a 24, and quadruples with a 23 but not a 24.

Wait, but in

---------------

 the case with a 23, do we need to account for the other primes?

Wait, let's consider first the case with 24:



---------------

Case1: Quadruple contains 24. Then, the remaining three numbers must have factorials multiplying to 1 (since 24! *1*1*1=24!), so they

---------------

 must all be 1. So that gives 4 possibilities as before.

Case2: Quadruple contains 23 but not 24. Then, the product

---------------

 of the four factorials is 23! * a! * b! * c! =24!.

Therefore, a! * b! * c! =24 /

---------------

 (23! /24!)? Wait, no, let me recast:

Wait, 24! =24 ×23!.

Therefore, if one of the numbers

---------------

 is 23, then the remaining three factorials must multiply to 24! /23! =24.

So

---------------

 the remaining three factorials must multiply to 24, which is 4!.

So the same as before. So as

---------------

 in case2 earlier, the three numbers must have factorials multiplying to 4!.

Which gives the same as before, 

---------------

6 ordered triples for each position of the 23, so total 4×6=24.

Wait, but in

---------------

 this case, the quadruple cannot contain a 24, so the 23 is present, and the rest are numbers whose factorials multiply to 24, but

---------------

 they can't be 24. Wait, but 24 is not a factorial except for 4!.

Wait, so

---------------

 when we considered the triples multiplying to 24, the numbers can be up to 4, since 4! is 24. So the

---------------

 other numbers can be 4,3,2,1 but not exceeding 4. Since 24 is excluded as

---------------

 a number (since we can't have 24 in this case). Wait, but 4 is allowed, since 4! is part of the product. So the

---------------

 numbers can be up to 4. So that is okay.

So in this case, the quadruple has one 23 and three numbers from

---------------

 1 to 4 such that their factorials multiply to 24. So that's valid.

Therefore, total cases

---------------

 so far: 4 +24=28.

But are there other cases?

Wait, maybe there's a case where two

---------------

 of the numbers are 23 and something else?

Wait, but two 23s would mean 23! squared

---------------

, which when multiplied by other factorials would be too large. Since 23! *23! is already (

---------------

23!)^2, and 24! is only 24×23!.

Thus, (23!)^2 is

---------------

 23! *23! =23! *24! /24, so that's way larger than 24!.

Therefore

---------------

, we can't have two 23s.

Similarly, having both 24 and 23 would give 24! *23! *...

---------------

 which is way too big.

Alternatively, what about having a 22 and a 24? Let me see.



---------------

Wait, if one number is 24 and another is 22, then 24! *22! * ... would

---------------

 already be 24! *22! which is way larger than 24!.

So, no, that's too

---------------

 big.

Alternatively, maybe a case where neither 24 nor 23 is present, but then we need to include

---------------

 the prime 23, which is impossible because 23 is a prime factor in 24!.

Therefore, all

---------------

 quadruples must include either 24 or 23, but not both. So the only possibilities are the two cases above.



---------------

Wait, but let me check another possibility. Suppose there is a 23 and another number that is 4, but

---------------

 arranged differently?

Wait, actually, in the second case where there is a 23, the remaining numbers can include a 4, but

---------------

 the total is already accounted for.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a case where we have two numbers contributing to the prime 23?

---------------

 But since 23 is prime, it can only come from one factorial. So only one of the factorials can include 23, so

---------------

 only one number can be 23 or higher. Since 24 is higher, but we already considered cases with 24 and 23.

Therefore

---------------

, the only possibilities are either a 24 with the rest 1s, or a 23 with three numbers whose factorials multiply to 24,

---------------

 which are the cases we considered.

Wait, but let's see if there are other cases where the quadruple has neither 24 nor 23 but still includes 23 via

---------------

 some factorial? But since 23 is prime, the only factorial that includes it is 23! or higher, so you

---------------

 have to have at least 23. So that can't be. Hence, indeed, only the two cases.

Wait

---------------

, but hold on, let's check another prime, like 19. Suppose the quadruple has a 19,

---------------

 but not 23 or 24. Then 19! would include 19 as a factor, but then

---------------

 23 would still need to be included, which can't happen. So no, that's invalid.

Therefore, the

---------------

 only valid quadruples are the ones in the two cases. Therefore total 4 +24=28.

But wait, hold

---------------

 on a second. Let me see if there are more possibilities in case2 where we have a 23 and three numbers whose factorials multiply to 24.

Earlier, I considered that the three numbers must

---------------

 have factorials multiplying to 4! =24, so the numbers can be (4,1,1) or (3,2,2). But perhaps

---------------

 there are other combinations?

Wait, let's see: 24 can also be expressed as 2! *3! *4! /

---------------

 something? Wait, no, need three factorials.

Wait, 2! * 2! * 6, but 6 is 3!.

Wait, 

---------------

2! * 2! *3! =2*2*6=24. That's already considered as (3,2,2)

---------------

 when considering the numbers 3,2,2.

Alternatively, 1! *4! *1! is (4,1,1). Are

---------------

 there any others?

Let me list all possible triples (a,b,c) where a!b!c! =24.

Possible factorials:

---------------

 1!,2!,3!,4!.

Let me list all possible combinations:

First, using 4!:

4! *1! *1! =24*1*1=24. So (4,1,1).

Second

---------------

, without using 4!:

Looking for three factorials (each ≤3!) whose product is 24.

3! is 6. So 6 * something.



---------------

If we take two 3!'s: 6*6=36, too big.

One 3! and two 2!'s: 6*2*2=24. So (3,2,2).

Alternatively, three 2!'s: 2*2*2=8, nope.

One

---------------

 3!, one 2!, one 1!: 6*2*1=12, nope.

Four

---------------

 2!'s but only three numbers.

Alternatively, using 1!'s:

If we have a 3! and the

---------------

 rest 1!'s: 6*1*1=6, too small.

Alternatively, 2!*2!*6,

---------------

 but 6 is 3!.

Thus, the only possibilities are indeed (4,1,1) and (3,2,2). So only

---------------

 two unordered triples, which give 3+3=6 ordered triples each as before.

So case2 is correctly accounted for.

Wait

---------------

, but another thought: What if one of the numbers is 5? Because 5! is 120, which is bigger than 24, but in case2, the remaining three numbers have

---------------

 to multiply to 24, so they can't be 5 or higher. Because 5! is 120 which is bigger

---------------

 than 24, so their factorials can't contribute to the product 24. So the numbers in the remaining three must be at

---------------

 most 4, so that's okay.

Therefore, the earlier analysis holds.

Wait, but what about the case where we

---------------

 have two numbers at 23 and one 1 and one something? But we saw that two 23s would make the product too big.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 there's a case with a 24 and another number?

Wait, suppose one number is 24 and another is 

---------------

4, then the remaining two would need to be 1!.

But that would be 24! *4! *1! *1!.

But 24! *4! is way bigger than 24!.

Wait, no

---------------

. Wait, the total product has to be exactly 24!.

If you have 24! multiplied by anything else except

---------------

 1!, it would exceed 24!.

Therefore, in case1, the only way is to have 24 and three 1!'s.

Therefore

---------------

, case1 is only 4 quadruples.

Similarly, in case2, the 23 must be accompanied by three numbers whose factorials multiply to 24, but

---------------

 not introducing any other large factorials.

Therefore, total is 4 +24=28.

But hold on, before

---------------

 I conclude, let me check another angle. Let's think of the exponents of the primes in 24!.

For

---------------

 example, let's take the prime 23. Its exponent in 24! is 1. So in the product a!b!c!d!, the total exponent of 23 must be 1.

The

---------------

 exponent of 23 in a factorial is 1 if the number is ≥23, and 0 otherwise. So

---------------

 exactly one of the numbers a,b,c,d must be ≥23, because 23's exponent is 1. Since

---------------

 23 and 24 are the only numbers ≥23 (since they are positive integers). So exactly one of the four numbers must be 23 or 24, and the others must be ≤22.

Therefore

---------------

, this gives two possibilities for that one number: either 23 or 24. Therefore, the total number of quadruples is the number of quadruples with exactly one 24 and the rest ≤23 (

---------------

but actually, the rest must be 1 as in case1) plus the number with exactly one 23 and the rest ≤22 (

---------------

but arranged so that their factorials multiply appropriately).

Wait, but according to the prime exponent logic, since the exponent of 23 is 1, exactly

---------------

 one of the numbers must be ≥23, so either 23 or 24, and the rest must be ≤22. However

---------------

, if the number is 24, then the rest can be anything ≤24, but their factorials multiplied by 24! must equal 24! so they have to be 1!

---------------

 each. So that's case1.

If the number is 23, then the remaining three numbers must be ≤22, and their factorials multiplied by 23! must equal 24!.

Which

---------------

 requires that the remaining three factorials multiply to 24, as before, so they can be up to 4,

---------------

 since 4! is 24. So the remaining numbers can be 1,2,3,4. So

---------------

 that's case2.

Therefore, the total is indeed 4 +24=28.

Wait, but let me think

---------------

 again of another prime, say 19. The exponent of 19 in 24! is 1. So in

---------------

 the product, the total exponent of 19 must be 1. The exponent of 19 in a factorial is 1 if the number is ≥19 and <20 (i.e., 19,

---------------

20,...24) or 0 otherwise. Wait, actually, the exponent of 19 in n! is floor(n/19). Since 19 divides 19, 20,...,24,

---------------

 so floor(n/19) is 1 for n≥19. So if any of the numbers is ≥19, then their

---------------

 factorial will have at least one 19. But since the total exponent must be 1, only one of the numbers can be ≥19, and the others must be <19.

But in our cases:

Case1: One

---------------

 number is 24 (which is ≥19), so the other three numbers must be ≤18 to not contribute to the exponent of 19. However, in case1, the other three numbers are 1, which are ≤18, so that's okay.

Case2: One number is 23 (which is ≥19), so the other three numbers must be ≤18. But in case2, the other numbers can be up to 4, which is ≤18, so that's okay.

Therefore

---------------

, this condition is satisfied in both cases.

Similarly for prime 17: exponent is 1. So similar reasoning: only one number can be ≥17. Since

---------------

 in case1, the 24 is ≥17, and others are 1, so okay. In case2, the 23 is ≥17, and others are ≤4, so okay.

Same for primes 13, 11, etc.

Therefore, the

---------------

 two cases are valid and there are no other cases.

Therefore, the total number of quadruples is 4 +24=28.

Wait, but let

---------------

 me check another angle. Let me see if there are other possibilities where the prime exponents could add up.

Take the prime 2,

---------------

 which has exponent 22 in 24!.

Suppose in case2 where we have a 23 and three numbers (

---------------

say x,y,z) with factorials multiplying to 24. Let me see the exponent of 2 in 23! plus

---------------

 the exponents in x!, y!, z! must equal 22.

The exponent of 2 in 23! is floor(23/2)+floor(23/4)+floor(23/8)+floor(23/16)+floor(23/32)=11+5+2+1+0=19.

Then

---------------

, the remaining three factorials must contribute 22-19=3 exponents of 2.

The remaining three numbers (

---------------

x,y,z) have factorials whose exponents of 2 must add up to 3.

Let me check for the triples

---------------

 in case2:

First possibility: (4,1,1). The exponents of 2 in 4! is 3 (since 4! has 2^3). The exponents in 1! are 0. So total is 3+0+0=3. That works.

Second possibility: (3,2,2). The exponent in 3! is floor(3/2)+floor(3/4)=1+0=1. Wait

---------------

, no, exponent of 2 in 3! is calculated as:

Wait, exponent of prime p in n! is sum_{k=1}^∞ floor(n/p^k). For prime 2 in 3!:

floor(3/2)=1, floor(3/4)=0. So total exponent 1.

Similarly, exponent of 2 in 2! is 1 (floor(2/2)=1). So for (3,2,2), the

---------------

 exponents are 1 (from 3!) +1 (from first 2!) +1 (from second 2!) = total 3. Perfect

---------------

, that adds to 3. So that works.

Therefore, the exponents for prime 2 check out.

Similarly, check

---------------

 another prime, say 3.

In case2, exponent of 3 in 23! is floor(23/3)+floor(23/9)+floor(23/27)=7+2+0=9.

Total exponent of 3 in 24! is 10, so remaining three factorials must contribute 1.

First

---------------

 case (4,1,1):

Exponent of 3 in 4! is floor(4/3)+floor(4/9)=1+0=1. The others are 0. Total 1. Good.

Second case (3,2,2):

Exponent of 3 in 3! is 1 (floor(3/3)=1). The 

---------------

2!s have 0. Total 1. Good.

Thus exponents of 3 work.

Similarly, prime 5:

In case2, 23! has exponent of 5: floor(23/5)+floor(23/25)=4+0=4. The

---------------

 total in 24! is 4, so remaining must contribute 0. The remaining numbers are up to 4, so their factorials don

---------------

't have 5 as a factor. So okay.

Prime 7:

23! has exponent floor(23/7)+floor(23/49)=3+0=3. 24! has exponent 3, so remaining contribute 0. The remaining numbers are ≤4, so okay.

Similarly,

---------------

 primes 11,13,17,19,23:

In case2, the 23! already

---------------

 includes all these primes (except 23 is exactly once). The remaining numbers are ≤4, so they don't contribute to

---------------

 these primes. So exponents match.

Therefore, all primes are accounted for.

Therefore, case2 is valid, and the

---------------

 total is indeed 28.

Wait, but I just thought of something else. In case2, when we have the

---------------

 three numbers whose factorials multiply to 24, perhaps there are more possibilities if considering different orderings?

Wait, no

---------------

. We considered ordered triples. For example, for the (4,1,1), there are 3 permutations, and for (3,2,2), there are 3 permutations. So when

---------------

 we multiplied by 4 positions for the 23, that should be correct.

Alternatively, let me think of an explicit example.

Take the quadruple (23,4,1,1). This

---------------

 is one quadruple where the 23 is first, then 4,1,1.

Another is (23,1,4,1), etc. So

---------------

 for each of the 4 positions of 23, the remaining three can be arranged in 3 ways for the 4 case and 3 ways for the 3,2,2 case. So total

---------------

 6 per 23 position, so 4×6=24. That seems right.

Therefore, I think the total number is 28. Hmm

---------------

.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says "ordered quadruples", so different orderings count as different even if they have the same numbers. So in

---------------

 case1, where you have (24,1,1,1), the 24 can be in any of the four positions, so 4 quadr

---------------

uples. That's straightforward.

In case2, for each position of the 23, the remaining three numbers can be arranged in different ways. For example, suppose 23 is in the first position. Then the remaining three numbers can be (4,1,1) in any order, so 3 permutations (the 4 can be in positions 2,3, or 4). Similarly, the (3,2,2) can be arranged in 3 ways (the 3 can be in any of the three positions). So 

---------------

3+3=6 for each position of 23, so 4×6=24.

Therefore, adding

---------------

 case1 and case2 gives 4+24=28.

Therefore, the answer is 28. Wait, but let

---------------

 me check once more for any oversight.

Is there a case where two of the numbers are 23? Let me see

---------------

. Suppose two 23s. Then the product would be 23! *23! *a! *b!.

But

---------------

 23! *23! is way larger than 24! since 23! *23! = (23!)^2 and 24! =24*23!.

So

---------------

 (23!)^2 /24! =23! /24, which is an integer? 23! divided by 24 is 23!/(24)= (23)!/(24)= (23×22!)/ (24)= (23×22!)/(24). Since

---------------

 24=4×6, but 22! includes factors up to 22, so 24 divides 22!? Wait

---------------

 24=2^3*3. 22! has plenty of 2s and 3s, so yes, 23! divided by24 is integer. However

---------------

, the product would then be 23! *23! *a! *b! =24! =>

---------------

 23! *a! *b! =24!/23! =24.

Therefore, the remaining two factorials must

---------------

 multiply to 24/(23! /23! ?) Wait, no, let me re-express:

Wait, if two of the numbers are 23, then:



---------------

Total product is 23!^2 *a! *b! =24!.

So a! *b! =24!/(23!^2)= (24×23!)/(23!×23!)=24/(23!).

Wait, 24/(23!)? That's a fraction. So

---------------

 that can't be, since a! and b! are integers. Therefore, this is impossible.

Therefore, two 23s are

---------------

 impossible. So no such quadruples.

Similarly, having a 23 and a 24 would give 23! *24! * ...

---------------

 which is way too big. So that's invalid.

Therefore, the only cases are the two considered, totaling 28.

Wait

---------------

, but hold on. Let me think of another prime, say 7. In case2, the exponent of 7 in 23! is 3, which matches the exponent in 24!.

The

---------------

 remaining three numbers (up to 4) don't contribute any 7s, so that's okay.

Hmm, everything

---------------

 seems okay.

Alternatively, let me think of an explicit example of a quadruple in case2:

(23,4,1,1). This

---------------

 works because 23! *4! *1! *1! =23! *24 =24!.

Yes, that

---------------

 works.

Another example: (23,3,2,2). 23! *6 *2*2=23! *24=24!.

Also works.

Another one

---------------

: (1,23,2,3). The order doesn't matter except for counting ordered quadruples. So each

---------------

 permutation is counted separately.

Therefore, I think the answer is 28. But I need to be 100% sure. Wait, but

---------------

 let me see if there are other factorizations for the remaining three numbers.

Wait, suppose the three numbers are (2,3,4). Then their factorials multiply to 2! *3! *4! =2*6*24=288, which is more

---------------

 than 24. Not good.

Alternatively, (2,2,3). 2!*2!*3! =2*2*6=24. Wait

---------------

, hold on! Wait, that's the same as (3,2,2). So that's already counted.

Alternatively, (2,4,1): 2! *4! *1! =2*24*1=48, which is more

---------------

 than 24. Not okay.

Alternatively, (3,1,4): same as (4,3,1), which is part

---------------

 of the (4,1,1) case? No, wait, (3,1,4) would be 

---------------

6*1*24=144, which is too big. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, if

---------------

 the numbers are (3,1,4), then their factorials multiply to 3! *1! *4! =6*1*24=144. Not 24. So that's invalid

---------------

. So only the two cases where the product is exactly 24.

Therefore, yes, only the two unordered triples.

---------------

 So I think 28 is correct.

Therefore, the answer is 28. So I should write:

Answer: 28

Wait, but wait

---------------

, I just thought of something. The problem says "ordered quadruples of positive integers (a, b, c, d)". In case2, when we have the

---------------

 23 in one position and then the three numbers which can be arranged in 6 ways, but are we overcounting?

Wait, let's take

---------------

 an example where the three numbers are (4,1,1). The number of ordered triples here is 3 (since the 4 can be in any of the three positions). Similarly, for (3,2,2), the 3 can be in any of the three positions, so 3 ordered triples.

Therefore

---------------

, for each position of the 23 (4 positions), we have 3+3=6 ordered triples for the remaining three numbers. So 4×6=24. That is correct.

Therefore

---------------

, total is 28. I think that is correct. Therefore, the answer should be 28.

But wait

---------------

, let me check an online resource or think if there's another possible case.

Wait, let me think if there is a case with a

---------------

 24 and another number besides 1's. Suppose we have (24, 1,1,1) as

---------------

 case1. But suppose someone says, can we have (24, 2,1,1) ?

Then the product would be 24! *2! *1! *1! =24! *2 which is double

---------------

 24!, so that's too big. So no, that's invalid. So you can't have anything else except 1's with the 24.

Similarly, if

---------------

 you have (24, 1,1,2), same problem.

Therefore, case1 is only 4.

Therefore

---------------

, yes, I think 28 is correct.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{28}


To solve the problem of finding the number of ordered quadruples of positive integers \((a, b, c, d)\) such that \(a! \cdot b! \cdot c! \cdot d! = 24!\), we consider the prime factorization of \(24!\) and analyze the possible cases for the values of \(a, b, c, d\).

### Key Steps:

1. **Prime Factorization of \(24!\)**:
   - The prime factors of \(24!\) include primes up to 23. The exponents of these primes in \(24!\) are calculated as

---------------

 follows:
     - \(2^{22} \cdot 3^{10} \cdot 5^4 \cdot 7^3 \cdot 11^2 \cdot 13^1 \cdot 17^1 \cdot 19^1 \cdot 23^1\).

2. **Cases Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: One of the numbers is \(24\). The remaining three numbers must be \(1\) since \(24! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! = 24!\). There are \(4\) such quadruples (each position can be \(24\)).
   - **Case 2**: One of the numbers is \(23\). The remaining three numbers must multiply their factorials to \(24\) (since \(24! / 23! = 24\)). The valid triples (

---------------

considering factorials) are:
     - \((4!, 1!, 1!)\) leading to \(3\) permutations for each position of \(4\).
     - \((3!, 2!, 2!)\) leading to \(3\) permutations for each position of \(3\).
     - For each position of \(23\), there are \(3 + 3 = 6\) permutations. Thus, \(

---------------

4 \times 6 = 24\) quadruples.

3. **Verification**:
   - The prime exponents (

---------------

especially primes like \(23\), \(19\), etc.) are checked to ensure they sum correctly in both cases.
   - Other

---------------

 cases (e.g., including \(22\) or more than one \(23\)) are invalid due to exceeding the prime exponents or factorial values

---------------

.

### Conclusion:
The total number of ordered quadruples is the sum of the valid cases:
- Case 1: \(4\)
- Case 2: \(24\)

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{28}\).<|im_end|>
