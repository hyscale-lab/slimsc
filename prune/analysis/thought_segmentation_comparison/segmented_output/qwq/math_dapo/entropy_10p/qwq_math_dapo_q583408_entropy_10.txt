Okay, so I have this problem here: For each positive integer n, S(n) is the sum of the digits of n. I need to find how many values of n satisfy the equation n + S(n) + S(S(n)) = 2007. Hmm, alright

---------------

. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First off, I know that S(n) is the sum of the digits of n. So, for example, if n is 123, then S(n) would be 1+2+3=6. Then S(S(n)) would be S(6)=6. So in

---------------

 that case, n + S(n) + S(S(n)) would be 123+6+6=135. But in

---------------

 our problem, we need this sum to be 2007. 

The question is asking for how many such n exist. Alright

---------------

, so I need to find all n where when you add the number itself, the sum of its digits, and the sum of the digits of that sum, you get 2007. 

Let me think about possible strategies

---------------

 here. Since the equation involves n and its digit sums, maybe I can find some bounds on n first. Let's see. Since S(n) is at most 9 times the number of digits of n. For

---------------

 example, if n is a 4-digit number, the maximum S(n) would be 9*4=36, and

---------------

 then S(S(n)) would be at most S(36)=3+6=9. So the total maximum contribution

---------------

 from S(n) and S(S(n)) for a 4-digit number would be 36 + 9 = 45. Therefore

---------------

, n must be at least 2007 - 45 = 1962. Wait, but

---------------

 that might not be precise because S(n) can be smaller. Hmm, maybe I need to get tighter bounds.

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 I can express n in terms of the equation. Let me rearrange the equation:

n = 2007 - S(n) - S(S(n))

So n must be equal to 2007 minus the sum of its digits and the sum of the digits of that sum. Since S(n) and S(S(n)) are both positive integers, n must be less than 2007. So n is in the range 1 to 2006. But actually

---------------

, since S(n) can't be too big, maybe n is closer to 2007. Let me see.

Let

---------------

 me think about the maximum possible value of S(n) for a number n less than 2007. The maximum S(n) would be for the number 1999, which has digits 1+9+9+9=28. Then S(S(n)) would be S(28)=10, so S

---------------

(S(n)) is 10. Therefore, the maximum possible value of S(n) + S(S(n)) would be 28 + 10 = 38. Therefore, the minimal n would be 2007 - 38 = 1969. Wait, so n has to be between 1969 and 2006? Because

---------------

 n = 2007 - (S(n) + S(S(n))), and S(n) + S(S(n)) is at least, say

---------------

, 1 + 1 = 2 (for n=1, but n is up to 2006). But

---------------

 actually, since n is close to 2007, maybe the lower bound is 1969. Hmm

---------------

, okay. So n is in the range 1969 to 2006. That narrows it down a bit.

Alternatively, maybe I

---------------

 can think in terms of modulo 9. Because the sum of the digits of a number is congruent to the number modulo 9. So S(n) ≡ n mod 9, and then S(S(n)) would also be ≡ S(n) mod 9, so S(S(n)) ≡ n mod 9 as well. Therefore, the equation becomes n + S(n) + S(S(n)) ≡ n + n + n ≡ 3n mod 9. Since

---------------

 2007 is divisible by 9, because 2+0+0+7=9, which is divisible by 9. So 2007 ≡ 0 mod 9. Therefore, 3n ≡ 0 mod 9 ⇒ n ≡ 0 mod 3. So n must be a multiple of 3. That's a useful piece of information. So n must be divisible by 3. That reduces

---------------

 the possible candidates.

So n must be between 1969 and 2006, divisible by 3, so let's see.

---------------

 Let me note that 2007 divided by 3 is 669, so 2007 is a multiple of 3, so numbers

---------------

 around that would be multiples of 3. Let me compute the lower bound again. Wait, the maximum S(n) + S(S(n)) is

---------------

 38 as above, so n is at least 2007 - 38 = 1969. But

---------------

 1969 divided by 3 is approximately 656.333. So the first multiple of 3 in

---------------

 that range would be 1970? Wait, 1969 divided by 3 gives a remainder.

---------------

 Let me check 1969 mod 3. 1+9+6+9 = 25, 2+5=7, so 7 mod 3 is 1. So 1969 mod 3 is 1, so the next number divisible

---------------

 by 3 is 1970? 1+9+7+0=17, 1+7=8, so

---------------

 8 mod 3 is 2. Hmm, not. Wait maybe I should compute 1969 divided by 3.

---------------

 3*656=1968, so 1969 is 1968 +1, so yes

---------------

, remainder 1. So next multiple of 3 is 1971. So starting from 1971 up to 2007, but n must be less than 2007, so up to 2004.

---------------

 Wait 2004 is the last multiple of 3 before 2007. So the possible n's are from 1971 to 2004, stepping by 3. Let

---------------

 me confirm that upper bound. The maximum n is 2006, but 2004 is the last multiple of 3 below 2007. So n

---------------

 can be from 1971 to 2004, in steps of 3. That's (2004 - 1971)/3 +1 = (33)/3 +1 = 11 +1 = 12 numbers? Wait,

---------------

 maybe not. Let me compute how many terms: The numbers are 1971, 1974,...,2004. The number

---------------

 of terms is ((2004 -1971)/3)+1 = (33/3)+1=11+1=12. So 12 numbers. But maybe

---------------

 not all of them will satisfy the equation. So I need to check each of these 12 numbers? Hmm, but

---------------

 maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, maybe I can let n = 2007 - S(n) - S(S(n)). Since n must be equal

---------------

 to that, so perhaps I can denote x = S(n), then S(S(n)) is S(x). So the equation becomes n = 2007 - x - S(x). Then

---------------

, since x is the sum of the digits of n, which is S(n) = x, so we can write n

---------------

 = 2007 - x - S(x). Therefore, if I can find x such that when you compute n as 2007 - x - S(x), then S(n) = x. So this

---------------

 is a system where x must be the digit sum of n, and n must be 2007 - x - S(x). So perhaps

---------------

 I can loop over possible x values and see if the corresponding n has digit sum x. 

So first, I need to find possible x's

---------------

. Since x = S(n), and n is between 1969 and 2006, let's see what possible values x can take. The minimal digit sum for numbers in that range:

---------------

 the smallest number is 1969, so its digit sum is 1+9+6+9=25. The largest number is 2006, digit sum is 2+0+0+6=8. Wait, wait

---------------

 a second. Wait, 2006 is 2+0+0+6=8? Wait that's way

---------------

 lower. Hmm, so actually the digit sums can vary quite a bit. Wait, maybe my previous assumption about the maximum S

---------------

(n) was wrong. Let me check.

Wait, 1999 has a digit sum of 1+9+9+9=28. 

---------------

2006 is 2+0+0+6=8. So actually, the maximum digit sum in that range (1969 to 2006) would be 28, as

---------------

 in 1999, and the minimum digit sum is 8 (for 2006) or maybe even lower. Wait, 1980 would be 1+9+8+0=18. Hmm. Wait, actually

---------------

, the minimal digit sum would be for 2000, which is 2, but 2000 is not

---------------

 in the range (since n has to be less than 2007, but 2000 is okay

---------------

). Wait, 2000 is 2+0+0+0=2. So the digit sums can range from 2 up to 28. However

---------------

, since n must be between 1969 and 2006, let's see:

Wait, 

---------------

1969's digit sum is 1+9+6+9=25.

Wait, 2001 is

---------------

 2+0+0+1=3.

2002 is 2+0+0+2=4.

2003 is 5, 2004 is 6, 2005 is 7, 2006 is 8. So actually, the minimum digit sum in the range

---------------

 from 1969 to 2006 is 2 (for 2000), but since 

---------------

2000 is within that range. Wait, but 2000 is included in the possible n's. Wait, but 

---------------

2000 is a possible n? Let's check. Wait, n must be such that n + S(n) + S(S(n)) = 2007. So

---------------

 if n=2000, then S(n)=2, S(S(n))=2. Then total would be 2000+2+2=2004, which is less than 2007. So 2000 is not a solution, but the

---------------

 digit sum can indeed be as low as 2. However, since n must be at least 1969, but

---------------

 2000 is above that. Wait, but 1970 would have digit sum 1+9+7+0=17. Hmm

---------------

.

So the possible x (digit sum) can range from, say, 2 up to 28. But given

---------------

 that n is between 1969 and 2006, and n = 2007 - x - S(x), then n

---------------

 must be in that interval. So let's think of x as between, say, let's find the possible x such that 1969 ≤ 2007 - x - S(x) ≤ 2006.

So rearranged, 

---------------

2007 - x - S(x) ≥ 1969 ⇒ x + S(x) ≤ 2007 - 1969 = 38.

Similarly, 2007 - x - S(x) ≤ 2006 ⇒ x + S(x) ≥ 1.

But the upper

---------------

 bound here is x + S(x) ≤ 38. Since x can be up to 28 (as in 1999's

---------------

 digit sum is 28), then S(x) would be at most S(28)=10. So x + S(x) would

---------------

 be up to 28 + 10 = 38. So the maximum x + S(x) is exactly 38. So that

---------------

's why the upper bound is 38, so x can be up to 28, but even with x=28, S(x)=10, so x

---------------

 + S(x)=38. So the possible x's are those integers where x + S(x) ≤ 38, and x is between, say, 

---------------

2 up to 28. But actually, x must be the digit sum of n, which is between 2 and 28 as

---------------

 above, so x ∈ [2,28].

Therefore, x can range from 2 to 28, but with

---------------

 x + S(x) ≤ 38. Let me see, for x from 2 to 28, compute

---------------

 x + S(x) and see which ones are ≤38. But since for x up to 28, the maximum x + S(x) is 28 + 10 = 38, so all x from 2 to 28 are

---------------

 possible except maybe some? Wait, for example, if x=19, then S(x)=10, so x+S(x)=29, which is less

---------------

 than 38. So actually, all x from 2 to 28 satisfy x + S(x) ≤38.

---------------

 Wait, because even for x=28, it's exactly 38. So all x from 2 to 28 are possible candidates

---------------

. But actually, the digit sum x must correspond to some n in the range 1969 to 2006, so maybe

---------------

 not all x are possible. Hmm. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to iterate through possible x from, say, let

---------------

's see, the minimal possible x such that n =2007 -x - S(x) is at least 1969. Let

---------------

 me think. The minimal x would correspond to the maximal n, which is 2006. Let's see,

---------------

 if n=2006, then x = S(n)=8, so S(S(n))=8. Then n

---------------

 + S(n) + S(S(n)) = 2006 +8 +8=2022, which is more

---------------

 than 2007, so that's not a solution. Wait, so perhaps my initial thought that n can be up to 2006 is wrong

---------------

? Wait, hold on. Wait, n has to satisfy n + S(n) + S(S(n)) =2007. So if n is 2006, then the

---------------

 total would be 2006 +8 +8=2022 which is too big. Therefore, n can't be that big. So

---------------

 maybe my initial upper bound was wrong? Hmm, so perhaps I need to think again.

Wait, perhaps my mistake was in

---------------

 the initial calculation. Let me see. Since n =2007 - S(n) - S(S(n)), so n

---------------

 must be less than 2007, but actually, S(n) and S(S(n)) are positive, so n is less than 2007. But when

---------------

 n is large, S(n) is smaller? Wait, for example, 2000 has digit sum 2. So if

---------------

 n is near 2007, like 2000, the digit sum is small, so n + S(n) + S(S(n)) would

---------------

 be 2000 +2 +2=2004, which is under 2007. Wait

---------------

, so actually, to reach 2007, n has to be such that when you add its digit sum and the digit sum of that, you get up

---------------

 to 2007 -n. So perhaps n is around 2007 minus something like 30?

---------------

 Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for n in the range of 1969 to 2006, but

---------------

 when n is higher, S(n) is lower, so the total sum n + S(n) + S(S(n)) would

---------------

 be less? Wait, maybe the maximum value of n + S(n) + S(S(n)) occurs at some point.

---------------

 Let me check with n=1999: 1999 +28 +10=2037. Which

---------------

 is over 2007. Hmm, so that's actually over. So if n is 1999, the

---------------

 total is 2037. So that's too big. Therefore, n must be less than 1999?

---------------

 Wait, but 1999 gives 2037, which is higher than 2007, so to

---------------

 get 2007, n must be less than that?

Wait, let's see. Let's take n=2007 - (S(n) + S(S(n))). Since

---------------

 S(n) + S(S(n)) must be equal to 2007 -n. Since S(n) is at least 1 (for

---------------

 n ≥1), so 2007 -n must be at least 1, so n ≤2006. 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I can set variables. Let me denote x = S(n), y = S(S(n)). Then the equation is n + x + y =2007. Also

---------------

, since y = S(x), because y is the sum of the digits of S(n). So we can write y = S(x). So the

---------------

 equation becomes n + x + S(x) =2007. So n =2007 -x -S(x). So

---------------

 given that, n must be a positive integer, and x must be the digit sum of n, and y must be the digit sum of x. 

Therefore, the

---------------

 problem reduces to finding all x such that:

1. x = S(n), where n=2007 -x -S(x)

2. y

---------------

 = S(x), and the equation holds.

Additionally, n must be a positive integer, so 2007 -x -S(x) must be positive, so x + S(x) <2007. Which is certainly

---------------

 true since x ≤28 (as digit sum of n which is less than 2007), so x + S(x) ≤28 +10=38 <

---------------

2007. So that condition is okay.

Therefore, the key is to find all x in the possible range (probably

---------------

 1 to 28) such that when you compute n=2007 -x -S(x), then the digit sum of n is x. 



---------------

Therefore, the plan is:

- Iterate x from possible minimum to maximum (probably 1 to 28)

- For each x, compute n =2007 -x -S(x)

- Check if the digit sum of n is indeed x

- If yes, then check if S(S(n)) is equal to S(x). Wait, but since y=S(x) and the

---------------

 equation already includes that, perhaps that is automatically satisfied? Wait, let me see. 

Wait, since in the equation n +x + y =2007, and y=S(x). So once

---------------

 n is computed as 2007 -x - y, then if S(n)=x, then it's okay. Because

---------------

 then the equation is satisfied. So the key condition is that S(n)=x. Since y is S(x), so once

---------------

 x is fixed, y is determined, so the only condition is that S(n)=x where n=2007 -x - S(x). Therefore, for

---------------

 each x, compute n and check if S(n)=x.

Therefore, the steps are:

1. For x from, say, 1 up to 28:

   a. Compute y = S(x)

   b. Compute n_candidate =2007 -x - y

   c. Compute S(n_candidate). If this equals x, then x

---------------

 is valid, so n_candidate is a solution.

2. Count all such n_candidate where this holds.

So let's try to do this step by step. Let

---------------

 me make a table.

First, let's note that x must be between 1 and 28. Let's start

---------------

 with x=1:

x=1:

y=S(1)=1

n_candidate=2007 -1 -1=2005

Check S(2005): 2+0+0+5=7≠1. Not valid.

x=2:

y=S(2)=2

n_candidate=2007-2-2=2003

S(2003)=2+0+0+3=5≠2. Not valid.

x=3:

y=3

n=2007-3-3=2001

S(2001)=2+0+0+1=3. Hey, that works! So x=3 is valid. So n=2001 is a solution.

x

---------------

=4:

n=2007-4-4=2007-8=1999

Compute S(1999)=1+9+9+9=28≠4. Not valid.

x=9:

y=S(9)=9

n=2007-9-9=2007-18=1989

S(1989)=1+9+8+9=27≠9. No

---------------

.

x=10:

y=S(10)=1+0=1

n=2007-10-1=1996

S(1996)=1+9+9+6=25≠10. Not valid.

x=11:

y=S(11)=1+1=2

n=2007-11-2=1994

S(1994)=1+9+9+4=23≠11. No.

x=12:

y=S(12)=1+2=3

n=2007-12-3=1992

S(1992)=1+9+9+2=21≠12. Nope.

x=13:

y=S(13)=4

n=2007-13-4=1990

S(1990)=1+9+9+0=19≠13. Not.

x=14:

y=S(14)=5

n=2007-14-5=1988

S(1988)=1+9+8+8=26≠14. No.

x=15:

y=S(15)=6

n=2007-15-6=1986

S(1986)=1+9+8+6=24≠15. Not

---------------

.

x=16:

y=S(16)=7

n=2007-16-7=1984

S(1984)=1+9+8+4=22≠16. Nope.

x=17:

y=S(17)=8

n=2007-17-8=1982

S(1982)=1+9+8+2=20≠17. No.

x=18:

y=S(18)=9

n=2007-18-9=1980

S(1980)=1+9+8+0=18. Hey, this works! So x=18 is valid. n=1980 is a solution.

x=19:

y=S(19)=10+1=10 (Wait S(19)=1+9=10)



---------------

Wait, so y=10

Wait, n=2007 -19 -10=2007 -29=1978

Compute

---------------

 S(1978)=1+9+7+8=25≠19. Not valid.

x=20:

y=S(20)=2

n=2007-20-2=1985

S(1985)=1+9+8+5=23≠20. Nope.

x=21:

y=S(21)=3

n=2007-21-3=1983

S(1983)=1+9+8+3=21. Wait

---------------

, that's equal to x=21! So this works. So n=1983 is a solution.

x=22:

y=S(22)=4

n=2007 -22 -4=1981

S(1981)=1+9+8+1=19≠22. Not valid.

x=23:

y=S(23)=5

n=2007-23-5=1979

S(1979)=1+9+7+9=26≠23. No.

x=24:

y=S(24)=6

n=2007-24-6=1977

S(1977)=1+9+7+7=24. Hey

---------------

, that's equal to x=24. So this works. So n=1977 is a solution.

x=25:

y=S(25)=7

n=2007 -25 -7=1975

S(1975)=1+9+7+5=22≠25. Nope.

x=26:

y=S(26)=8

n=2007-26-8=1973

S(1973)=1+9+7+3=20≠26. Not.

x=27:

y=S(27)=9

n=2007 -27 -9=1971

S(1971)=1+9+7+1=18≠27. No

---------------

.

x=28:

y=S(28)=10 (since 2+8=10)

n=2007-28-10=1969

S(1969)=1+9+6+9=25≠28. Not valid.

Okay, so from

---------------

 x=1 to x=28, the valid x's where S(n)=x are x=3, 18,21,24. 



---------------

So that gives us four n's: 2001,1980,1983,1977. Wait, let me check each

---------------

 of those again:

For x=3, n=2001: S(2001)=2+0+0+1=3 ✔️

x=18: n=1980: S(1980)=1+9+8+0=18 ✔️

x=21: n=1983: 1+9+8+3=21 ✔️

x=24: n=1977:1+9+7+7=24 ✔️

So four solutions? Wait, but let's check if there are any others.

---------------

 Wait, when I went through each x from 1 to 28, these were the only ones that worked. But

---------------

 let me check if maybe I missed any?

Wait, when x=24, n=1977, which

---------------

 is within the 1969-2006 range. Similarly for the others. 

Wait, but let

---------------

 me check x=25, 26, etc., just to be sure. Wait, I think I covered all. Let

---------------

 me recount the valid x's:

At x=3: yes

x=18: yes

x=21: yes

x=24: yes

So total of 4.

---------------

 Hmm, but let me check if there are any other x's where S(n)=x.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in

---------------

 calculation for some x? Let me double-check some of the edge cases.

x=24:

n=1977: digits 1,9,7,7. Sum is 1+9+7+7=24. Correct.

x=21:

n=1983: 1+9+8+3=21. Correct.

x=18:

1980: 1+9+8+0=18. Correct.

x=3:

2001: 2+0+0+1=3. Correct.

Hmm

---------------

. So four solutions. But wait, let me check x= 27:

Wait for x=27, n=1971, S

---------------

(n)=18. Not 27. Correct.

x=25: n=1975, sum is 22. Not

---------------

 25. Okay.

Wait, what about x= 12? n=1992, sum is 21. Not 12. So

---------------

 no.

Wait, x= 9: n=1989, sum 27. Not 9. So

---------------

 that's not.

Hmm, so four solutions. Wait, but let me see if there are any other x's. Let

---------------

 me check x= 15: n=1986, sum 24. Not 15. No

---------------

.

Wait, x=6: n=1995, sum 24. Not 6.

Hmm. Maybe

---------------

 I missed some?

Wait, let's try x= 12 again. Wait, no. Wait, let me check x= 20:



---------------

x=20, n=1985, sum is 1+9+8+5=23. Not 20.

Hmm, so

---------------

 only four? Wait, but let me check x= 10:

n=1996, sum is 1+9+9+6=25. Not 10.

Hmm. Wait

---------------

, maybe x= 15?

Wait, x=15 gives n=1986, sum is 1+9+8+6=24≠15. So

---------------

 no.

Hmm. Wait, so four solutions. But let me check if there are any other x's between 1 to 28 that

---------------

 I might have miscalculated.

Wait, let's check x= 24 again. 2007 -24 -6 (since S(24)=6+

---------------

2=6? Wait, S(24) is 2+4=6. So yes, y=6. So 2007-24-6=1977. Correct. S

---------------

(1977)=24.

Wait, x= 21: S(21)=3. So 2007-21-3=1983. Correct.

Wait

---------------

, x= 18: S(18)=9, so 2007-18-9=1980. Correct.

x=3: S(3)=3, so 2007-3-3=2001. Correct.

So

---------------

, four values. But let me check x= 27 again: S(27)=9, so n=2007-27-9=1971. S(n)=1+9+7+1=18, which is not 27. So no

---------------

. 

Wait, perhaps I missed an x where S(n)=x?

Wait, let me check x= 15 again. Wait

---------------

, x=15, n=1986, sum is 24, which would mean x=24. So

---------------

 that's covered when x=24. 

Hmm. Wait, maybe I should check x= 24 again. So

---------------

 n=1977, which gives S(n)=24, so that's correct.

Hmm. So total of four solutions

---------------

. But let me see if there's a possibility of x= something else.

Wait, let me check x= 12 again. x

---------------

=12, n=1992, sum is 1+9+9+2=21, so that

---------------

's x=21. So when x=21, n=1983. Wait, but that's different

---------------

. So perhaps there is a chain here?

Wait, perhaps there is an error in my process. Let me check x= 21:



---------------

Wait, when x=21, then n=2007 -21 - S(21). S(21)=3, so 2007-24=1983. Correct

---------------

. And S(1983)=21. Correct.

Wait, so all steps are correct. So that gives

---------------

 four n's. But wait, let me check another possible x. 

Wait, x= 24, n=1977. Let

---------------

 me confirm S(n)=24. 1+9+7+7=24. Yes. 

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 there are more?

Wait, let me check x= 17 again. x=17, n=1982. S(n)=1+9+8+2=20≠17. 



---------------

Hmm. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I missed x= 6? Wait, x=6, n=1995, sum is 24. So

---------------

 that would be x=24. So that's covered when x=24. 

Wait, perhaps I need to check x

---------------

=24 again. So, yes, that's already counted. 

Wait, maybe I need to check x= 2

---------------

5. 2007-25-7=1975. S(n)=1+9+7+5=22≠25. 



---------------

Hmm. Hmm. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in calculation for x= 15, but I think I

---------------

 didn't. Let me see:

Wait, let me check x= 18 again. n=1980. 

---------------

1+9+8+0=18. Correct. 

Wait, maybe I should check if there are other x's beyond

---------------

 28? Wait, the maximum digit sum for numbers less than 2007 is 28 (for

---------------

 1999). So x cannot be more than 28, so that's covered. 

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 x= 1. Wait, x=1, n=2005, which gives sum 7. Not

---------------

 1. 

Hmm. 

Wait, perhaps I missed x= 27? But no, that gives n=1971 with sum 18. 

Wait, so

---------------

 four solutions. Hmm. But maybe I made a mistake in the initial steps? Let me check another way. 

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 the four numbers are 1977,1980,1983,2001. Let me compute

---------------

 n + S(n) + S(S(n)) for each of these to confirm.

First, 1977:

n=1977, S(n)=24, S(S(n))=S(24)=6. So total:1977+24+6=2007. Correct.

1980: S(n)=18, S(S(n))=9. 1980+18+9=2007. Correct.

1983: S(n)=21, S(S(n))=3. 1983+21+3=2007. Correct.

2001: S(n)=3, S(S(n))=3. 2001+3+3=2007. Correct.

So all four are

---------------

 valid. So that gives four solutions. Hmm, but the problem says "how many values of n". So the answer is 4?

Wait, but let

---------------

 me check if there are any other numbers. Wait, when I was going through x=1 to 28, I

---------------

 found four. But let me check x= 12 again. Wait, n=1992, which had

---------------

 S(n)=21. But 21 is another x. So that's already accounted for when x=21. So no

---------------

 problem.

Wait, what about x=22? n=1981, S(n)=1+9+8+1=19. So

---------------

 that's x=19, but when x=19, n=1978, whose digit sum was 25. So

---------------

 no cross-over. 

Hmm. Wait, maybe I need to check x= 16? Let me see, x=16 gives

---------------

 n=1984, S(n)=22, which would be x=22. But x=22 gives

---------------

 n=1981, which has sum 19. So there's no cycle here.

Hmm. So perhaps

---------------

 only four solutions. Wait, but let me check another possible x. Let me see x= 7:

x=7 gives n=1993, S

---------------

(n)=22, which would be x=22. But when x=22, n=1981,

---------------

 which has S(n)=19. So nothing there. 

Hmm, so I think only four. But wait, the

---------------

 problem might have more? Wait, let me think again. Wait, when I considered x from 1 to 28, I

---------------

 found four. But maybe there are some x values where n is a 3-digit number? Wait, but n has to be at least 1969, so n

---------------

 must be 4-digit. Except maybe 1969 itself. Wait, 1969 is a four-digit number. So all n's are

---------------

 four-digit numbers between 1969 and 2006. So the four solutions I found are all four-digit numbers. 

Wait, but

---------------

 let me check n=1998. Just for fun. S(n)=1+9+9+8=27. Then S(S(n))=9. So total would be 1998+27+9=2034.

---------------

 Which is over. 

Wait, another thought: perhaps I missed x= 15? Let me see, x=15,

---------------

 n=1986. S(n)=1+9+8+6=24. So that would correspond

---------------

 to x=24. Which is already counted. So that's okay. 

Wait, so perhaps four is the correct answer. Hmm

---------------

. But let me think again. 

Wait, another way to approach: Let me see if there are other numbers between 1969 and 2006 where

---------------

 n + S(n) + S(S(n)) =2007. Let me pick n=1998:

---------------

 already checked. 

n=1995: S(n)=24, S(S(n))=6. 

---------------

1995+24+6=2025. Too big.

n=1992: 

---------------

1992+21+3=2016. Still over.

n=1989: 1989+27+9=2025. 



---------------

n=1986: 1986+24+6=2016. 

n=1983: 

---------------

1983+21+3=2007. Correct.

n=1980: 1980+18+9=2007. Correct.

n=1977: 1977+24+6=2007. Correct.

n=2001: 2001+3+3=2007. Correct.

Hmm

---------------

. What about n=1995? Wait, that gives 2025, which is too big.

Wait, n

---------------

=1990: S(n)=1+9+9+0=19. Then S(S(n))=10. So total is 1990+19+10=2019. Still

---------------

 over.

n=1986: already checked.

Wait, n=1974: Let's see. 

---------------

1+9+7+4=21. Then S(S(n))=3. So total:1974 +21 +3=1998. Not 2007. 

Hmm. n

---------------

=1971: 1+9+7+1=18, S(S(n))=9. So total 1971+18+9=1998. Nope

---------------

.

n=1968: 1+9+6+8=24. S(S(n))=6. Total:1968+24+6=1998. Hmm

---------------

. 

Hmm. Wait, what about n=1995? 1995+24+6=2025. Still

---------------

 over.

Hmm. So it seems like only those four numbers work. Therefore, the answer is 4?

Wait, but I

---------------

 recall that in some problems like this, sometimes there can be more solutions. Let me check another number. Let's see n=1992: sum

---------------

 is 21, so 1992+21+3=2016. Not enough. 

Wait, n

---------------

=1986: 1986+24+6=2016. Still over.

Wait, n=1983:

---------------

 correct. 

Wait, n=1980: correct. 

Wait, n=1977: correct.

n=2001: correct.

Hmm

---------------

. Maybe I need to check numbers below 1977? For example, n=1974. Let

---------------

 me check n=1974: S(n)=1+9+7+4=21. S(S(n))=3. So total is 1974+21+3=1998. Not enough. 

n

---------------

=1971: 1971+18+9=1998. Still not. 

Wait, n

---------------

=1969: S(n)=1+9+6+9=25. S(S(n))=7. So total is 1969+25+7=2001. Not 2007. 

Hmm. 



---------------

Wait, perhaps n= 1998? Wait, that was over. 

Wait, n=1995?

---------------

 Over. 

Wait, n=1993: sum 22, so total is 1993+22+4=2019. 

Hmm. 

Wait, so

---------------

 I think only four numbers satisfy the equation. So the answer should be 4. 

Wait, but let me check once

---------------

 more. Let me check n= 1983: 

1983 + 21 + 3 = 2007. Correct. 

1980 +18 +9 =2007. 

1977 +24 +6=2007. 

2001 +3 +3=2007. 

Yes

---------------

, four numbers. 

Wait, but wait a second, I just thought of something. When I considered x from 1 to 28, I

---------------

 assumed that x can be up to 28. But the digit sum of n can be 28, as in n=1999. Let me check if

---------------

 n=1999 is a solution. 

n=1999: S(n)=28, S(S(n))=10. So total is 1999 +28 +10=2037. Which is way

---------------

 over. 

Hmm. So not a solution. 

Wait, but maybe another number with digit sum 28? Like

---------------

 1899? Let's see: 1+8+9+9=27. Not 28. 1989: 1+9+8+9=27. 

---------------

1998:27. 1999:28. So only 1999 has digit sum 28, and that's over.

Okay. So I

---------------

 think four is correct. 

Wait, but let me check x= 24. So n=1977. Is

---------------

 there another x that can lead to another n?

Wait, let me check x=24, n=1977. 



---------------

If there's another x where n=2007 -x - S(x) gives S(n)=x. 



---------------

Wait, let me think of n=1986. Its digit sum is 24, so x would have to be 24. But

---------------

 n=1986 would require x=24, but then n=2007-24 - S(24)=2007-24-6=1977, not 1986. So that

---------------

's why only 1977 corresponds to x=24. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, perhaps I missed an

---------------

 x where x is higher? But no, since x can't be higher than 28. 

Alternatively, maybe there

---------------

's a three-digit number? Wait, n has to be at least 1969, so three-digit numbers are 100-999, which are too low. 

Hmm

---------------

. 

Wait, perhaps there is a mistake in my initial assumption that n must be between 1969 and 2006. Let me confirm

---------------

 that. 

The maximum possible S(n) + S(S(n)) is 28+10=38. So n must

---------------

 be at least 2007-38=1969. So yes, that's correct. So n can

---------------

't be lower than 1969. 

Therefore, the four numbers found are indeed the only solutions. So the answer is 4. 

Wait, but hold

---------------

 on. Let me check x= 15 again. Wait, if x=15, then n=2007-15-6=1986 (since S(15)=6). Then S(n)=1+9+8+6=24. So

---------------

 this would require x=24, but in this case, we started with x=15. So that's why

---------------

 it didn't work. But when x=24, we get n=1977, which does work. 

So

---------------

 the process is correct. 

Therefore, the answer is 4. 

Wait, but in my earlier check, I found

---------------

 four numbers. But let me see, perhaps I missed x= 12? Let me see, when x=12, n=1992. The

---------------

 digit sum of n is 1+9+9+2=21. So that would require x=21, which is another

---------------

 x. So when x=21, we get n=1983, which does work. So that's accounted

---------------

 for. 

So yeah, it's four. 

Hmm. I think that's it. So the answer should be 4. 

**Final Answer**
\boxed{4}


To solve the problem, we need to find the number of values of \( n \) such that \( n + S(n) + S(S(n)) = 2007 \), where \( S(n) \) denotes the sum of the digits of \( n \).

1. **Key

---------------

 Observations**:
   - \( n \) must be a positive integer.
   - \( S(n) \) and \( S(S(n)) \) are the sums of the digits of \( n \) and the sum of the digits of \( S(n) \), respectively.
   - The

---------------

 equation can be rearranged to \( n = 2007 - S(n) - S(S(n)) \).
   - \( n \) must be between 1969 and 2006 because the maximum value of \( S(n) + S(S(n)) \) is 38 (achieved when \( n = 1999 \))

---------------

.

2. **Modulo 9 Analysis**:
   - Since \( 2007 \equiv 0 \mod 9 \), \( n \) must be a multiple of 3.

3. **Iterate Over Possible Values**:
   - We consider \( x = S(n) \) and compute \( n = 2007 - x - S(x) \).
   - Check if \( S(n) = x \).

4. **Checking

---------------

 Each \( x \)**:
   - For \( x \) from 1 to 28 (since the maximum digit sum for \( n \) in

---------------

 the range is 28), we compute \( n \) and check if \( S(n) = x \).

5. **Valid Solutions**:
   - \( x = 3 \): \( n = 2001 \), \( S(2001) = 3 \)
   - \( x = 18 \): \( n = 1980 \), \( S(1980) = 18 \)
   - \( x = 21 \): \( n = 1983 \), \( S(1983) = 21 \)
   - \( x = 24 \): \( n = 1977 \), \( S(1977) = 24 \)

These

---------------

 are the only values of \( n \) that satisfy the equation. Therefore, the number of such values is:

\[
\boxed{4}
