Okay, so I need to find the largest integer n such that n is divisible by every integer less than the cube root of n. Hmm, let me try

---------------

 to parse this problem again. The question is asking for the maximum n where n is divisible by all numbers from 1 up to, but not including, the cube root of n. Wait, actually, it says "every integer less than the cube root of n". So the

---------------

 cube root of n might not be an integer, so maybe I have to consider all integers up to the floor of the cube root of n? Or

---------------

 maybe it's the floor, since integers can't be fractions. Let me think.

First, let me rephrase the problem to

---------------

 make sure I understand it. We need an integer n such that for every integer k where 1 ≤ k < ∛n, k divides n. And we want the largest such n. Got

---------------

 it. So the key here is that n must be divisible by all numbers less than its cube root. Since the cube root of n increases

---------------

 as n increases, there's a balance here. If n is too large, then its cube root is larger, so there are more divisors required, which might make it harder to satisfy. But

---------------

 we need the largest possible n where this condition holds.

Let me start by trying some examples. Maybe starting with small n and see how

---------------

 it works, but since we need the largest, maybe I can approach it more systematically.

Let me denote m as the integer part of ∛n. Since

---------------

 the cube root of n is not necessarily an integer, m would be the floor of ∛n. So m ≤ ∛n < m+1. Therefore

---------------

, n ≥ m³ and n < (m+1)³. So for each m, n must be at least m³ and less than (m+1)^3. Also

---------------

, n must be divisible by all integers from 1 up to m (since m is the floor of ∛n, so all

---------------

 integers less than ∛n would be up to m). Therefore, the problem reduces to, for each m, find the maximum

---------------

 n less than (m+1)^3 that is divisible by all numbers from 1 to m. Then, among all such n for different m, pick

---------------

 the largest one.

Wait, that seems like a good approach. Let me formalize this.

Suppose m is a positive integer, then for

---------------

 n to satisfy the condition, n must be divisible by all integers from 1 to m, and also n must be less than (m+1)^3. The

---------------

 maximum possible n for a given m is the least common multiple (LCM) of 1 through m, multiplied by some integer, but not

---------------

 exceeding (m+1)^3. However, since LCM(1..m) might already be less than (m+1)^3, then

---------------

 the maximum n for that m would be the LCM(1..m) multiplied by the largest integer k such that k * LCM(1..m) < (m+1)^3. Wait

---------------

, actually, perhaps the maximum n would just be the LCM(1..m) multiplied by the largest integer k where that product is still less than (m+1)^3. Alternatively

---------------

, maybe the LCM(1..m) itself might already be too big? Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the LCM(1..m) is the minimal number divisible by all numbers up to m, so if LCM(1..m) is less than (m+1)^3, then n

---------------

 could be LCM(1..m) multiplied by some factor, but still less than (m+1)^3. However

---------------

, to get the largest possible n for each m, we can set n as the largest multiple of LCM(1..m) that is less than (m+1)^3. But

---------------

 actually, the largest n for each m is the maximum multiple of LCM(1..m) less than (m+1)^3. Therefore

---------------

, for each m, compute LCM(1..m), then compute the maximum multiple of LCM(1..m) less

---------------

 than (m+1)^3, then among all those n's for different m's, pick the largest one.

Therefore

---------------

, the strategy is to iterate m starting from 1 upwards, compute for each m the maximum n as described, and keep

---------------

 track of the maximum n found so far. But since we want the largest possible n overall, we can try to find the

---------------

 maximum m where LCM(1..m) is still less than (m+1)^3, then proceed accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps there

---------------

's a point where m increases but LCM(1..m) becomes too large so that even the minimal LCM(1..m) is already larger

---------------

 than (m+1)^3, meaning that there is no such n for that m. So the maximum possible m is

---------------

 such that LCM(1..m) < (m+1)^3. Then, the largest n would be for

---------------

 that m.

Therefore, perhaps first find the maximal m where LCM(1..m) < (m+1)^3. Then compute

---------------

 the maximum n as the LCM(1..m) multiplied by floor[( (m+1)^3 -1 ) / LCM(1..m)

---------------

 )], but actually, the maximum multiple would be LCM(1..m) multiplied by k, where k is the largest

---------------

 integer such that k * LCM(1..m) < (m+1)^3. Therefore, k = floor( ( (m+1)^3 -1 ) / LCM(1..m) )

Alternatively

---------------

, if LCM(1..m) is already greater than (m+1)^3, then there is no n corresponding to that m, so we need to go

---------------

 back to lower m.

Therefore, perhaps I can start by trying m from 1 upwards and compute LCM(1..m), check

---------------

 if LCM(1..m) is less than (m+1)^3, then compute the maximum n for that m,

---------------

 and then proceed until LCM(1..m) exceeds (m+1)^3, then stop.

Let me start with

---------------

 small m values:

m=1:

LCM(1) = 1.

(m+1)^3 = 8.

So

---------------

 maximum n is the largest multiple of 1 less than 8, which is 7. But since 1 divides all

---------------

 numbers, so n can be up to 7. But since m=1, the cube root of n must be greater than 1, so n must be greater

---------------

 than 1^3=1. Wait, but m is floor of cube root of n. Wait, perhaps I need to be

---------------

 precise here.

Wait, let me think again. For m=1, the cube root of n must be greater than m=

---------------

1? Wait, m is the floor of cube root of n, so if m=1, then cube root of n is between 1 and 2, so n is between 1^3=1 and 2^3=8. So

---------------

 n must be in [1,8). But since n must be divisible by all integers less than cube root(n). Since cube root(n) is between 1 and 2, the integers less than that are just 1. So n

---------------

 must be divisible by 1, which is always true. So n can be any integer from 1 up to 7. The

---------------

 maximum n here is 7. However, since we are looking for the largest possible n overall, but maybe higher m's

---------------

 can give higher n's.

Moving on to m=2:

m=2:

We need to have n in [8, 27) since (m+1)^3 is 27. Wait

---------------

, actually, m is floor(∛n). So if m=2, then ∛n is between 2 and 3, so n is between 8 (inclusive?) Wait

---------------

, floor(∛n) = 2 means that 2 ≤ ∛n <3, so n ∈ [8, 27). So n must be divisible

---------------

 by all integers less than ∛n. Since ∛n is between 2 and 3, the integers less than that are 1 and 2. Therefore, n must be divisible by 1 and 2. Since

---------------

 1 divides everything, so n must be even. The maximum n here is 26, which is even. So maximum

---------------

 n for m=2 is 26.

Wait, but actually, LCM(1,2)=2. So the maximum multiple of 2 less than 27 is 26. So that's correct.

m

---------------

=3:

Now, m=3. Then n must be in [27, 64) because (m+1)^3 is 4^3=64. The cube root of n is between 3 and 4, so integers less than that are 1,2,3. Therefore, n must be divisible by 1,2,3. LCM(1,2,3)=6. The maximum multiple of 6 less than 64 is 60 (since 6*10=60, 6*11=66 which is over 64). Wait 6*10 is 60, 

---------------

6*10.666 is 64, so 60 is the largest multiple below 64. So

---------------

 n=60 here.

Wait, but 60 is less than 64. So maximum n for m=3 is 60.

m

---------------

=4:

Now m=4. So n must be in [64, 125). The cube root of n is between 4 and 5, so integers less than that are 1,2,3,4. LCM(1,2,3,4)=12. The maximum multiple of 12 less than 125 is 124 divided by 12?

---------------

 Let's see 12*10=120, 12*10=120, 12*10.416...

---------------

 So 120 is the maximum multiple less than 125. 120 < 125, so n=120 here

---------------

. Wait, but 12*10=120, which is less than 125. So

---------------

 that's okay. So maximum n for m=4 is 120.

Wait, but hold on, LCM(1-

---------------

4)=12. So 12*10=120, 12*11=132 which is over 125. So yes, 120.

m=5:

Now

---------------

 m=5. So n must be in [125, 216). The integers less than ∛n (which is between 5 and 6) are 1-5. LCM(1-5)=60. The maximum multiple of 60 less than 216. Let's see: 60*3=180, 60*4=240 which is over 216. So 180. Wait, but 60*3.6=216, so 60*3=180 is the maximum

---------------

 multiple below 216. Wait, but 60*3.6 is exactly 216? Wait

---------------

, no, 60*3.6 is 216? Let me check 60*3.6=

---------------

60*(3 + 0.6)=180 + 36=216. Yes, so 216 is exactly 6*36, but since

---------------

 n must be less than 216, then the maximum multiple is 60*3=180. Wait

---------------

, but 60*3.5=210, which is still less than 216. Wait, 

---------------

60*3.5=210? Wait, 60*3.5 is 60*(7/2)=210. Yes

---------------

. So actually, 210 is also a multiple of 60? Wait, no. 210 divided by 60 is 3.5, which is not an integer. So

---------------

 210 is not a multiple of 60. Wait, my mistake. The multiples of 60 are 60, 120, 180, 240, etc. So yes

---------------

, the next after 180 is 240 which is over 216. So maximum is 180. So

---------------

 for m=5, the maximum n is 180.

Wait, but hold on, LCM(1-5)=60. So the

---------------

 maximum n is 180? Hmm. Let me check if 180 is less than 216,

---------------

 which it is. So that's okay. So n=180 here.

m=6:

Moving on to m=6. Now

---------------

 n must be in [216, 343) since 7^3=343. The integers less than ∛n (which is between 6 and 7) are 1-6. LCM(1-6)=60?

---------------

 Wait no. LCM(1,2,3,4,5,6). Let me compute that again.

Factors

---------------

:

1: 1

2: 2

3: 3

4: 2²

5:5

6: 2×3

So LCM is the max exponents: 2², 3, 5. So LCM=4×3×5=60. Wait, but

---------------

 6 is already included in 2×3. Wait, so yes, LCM(1-6)=60. Wait, but

---------------

 60 is divisible by all numbers up to 6? Let me check: 60 divided by 6 is 10, which

---------------

 is okay. So yes, LCM(1-6)=60. So then, for m=6, the

---------------

 LCM is still 60. Then the maximum multiple of 60 less than 343. 60*5=300, 60*6=360 which is over 343. So the maximum is 300. Wait

---------------

, 60*5.716... So 300 is less than 343. So n=300 here

---------------

. Wait, but 60*5=300, so that's the maximum. So 300 is less

---------------

 than 343, so yes. So n=300.

Wait, but hold on. Let me confirm

---------------

 the LCM(1-6)=60. Hmm, but 1-6's LCM is actually 60? Let me check

---------------

 again. Let me see:

Prime factors:

1: 1

2: 2

3: 3

4: 2²

5:5

6:2×3

So the LCM is

---------------

 the product of the highest powers: 2², 3, 5. So 4×3×5=60. Yes, that's correct. So L

---------------

CM(1-6)=60. So yes, so the maximum multiple is 300. So for m=6, n=300.

m

---------------

=7:

Next, m=7. Then n must be in [343, 512) since 8^3=512. The integers less than ∛n (between 7 and 8) are 1-7. LCM(1-7). Let's compute that.

Prime

---------------

 factors:

1:1

2:2

3:3

4:2²

5:5

6:2×3

7:7

Thus, LCM is 2²×3×5×7=4×3×5×7=420. So LCM(1-7)=420.

Now

---------------

, the maximum multiple of 420 less than 512. 420×1=420, 420×2=840 which is over 512. So the maximum is 420. Since

---------------

 420 <512, so n=420 here.

Wait, so for m=7, the maximum n is 420.

m=8:

Now

---------------

 m=8. So n is in [512, 729) (since 9^3=729). The integers less than ∛n (between 8 and 9) are 1-8. LCM(1-8).

Compute LCM(1-8). Let's see:

Prime factors:

1:1

2:2

3:3

4:2²

5:5

6:2×3

7:7

8:2³

Thus LCM is 2³×3×5×7=8×3×5×7=840. Wait

---------------

, let me verify:

Highest power of 2 is 8 (2^3), 3 is 3, 5 is 5, 7 is 7. So yes, LCM(1-8)=840.

Then

---------------

 the maximum multiple of 840 less than 729. 840×1=840, which is over

---------------

 729. Therefore, there is no multiple of 840 less than 729 except 0, which is not positive. Therefore, for

---------------

 m=8, there is no n satisfying the condition. Wait, that's a problem. So m=8 can't have any n because

---------------

 LCM(1-8)=840 is already greater than (m+1)^3 -1, which is 728? Since 840>729?

---------------

 Wait, actually, (m+1)^3 is 9^3=729, so n must be less than 729. But

---------------

 LCM(1-8)=840, which is already bigger than 729, so there is no multiple of 840 less than 729 except 

---------------

0. Therefore, for m=8, there is no valid n. Therefore, m=8 is invalid.

Therefore, the maximum m for

---------------

 which there exists such an n is m=7, giving n=420. Wait, but before concluding, let me check m=7 again

---------------

. For m=7, the LCM is 420, and (m+1)^3 is 8^3=512, so 420 is less than 512. Therefore, the

---------------

 maximum multiple is 420 itself, since 420×1=420 <512. So

---------------

 n=420 is valid here.

But let's check m=6 again. For m=6, the maximum n was 300, which is less than 343. But

---------------

 420 (for m=7) is larger than 300, so 420 is a better candidate.

Proceed

---------------

ing to m=7, which gives n=420. But let's check m=9? Wait, but

---------------

 m=8 already didn't work. Let me check m=7.

Wait, but let's check m=7 again

---------------

. The LCM(1-7)=420. So n must be divisible by 1-7, and less

---------------

 than 512. The maximum such n is 420, but is there a higher multiple? 420×2=840, which is over 512, so no. So 420 is the maximum.

---------------

 So m=7 gives n=420. Now, let's check m=7 and see if 420 is

---------------

 indeed divisible by all numbers less than ∛420.

Wait, actually, we need to confirm that n=420 satisfies

---------------

 that every integer less than ∛n divides it. Let me compute ∛420. The cube root of 420 is approximately 7.5 (since 7^3=343, 8^3=512). So ∛420 ≈7.5. Therefore, all integers less than 7.5, so 1 through 7 must divide 420. Since

---------------

 LCM(1-7)=420, yes, 420 is divisible by all numbers up to 7. So that works.

Now

---------------

, proceeding to m=7, we get 420. Let's check m=6 again. For m=6, n

---------------

=300. Since 300 is less than 343 (the upper bound for m=6).

---------------

 The cube root of 300 is about 6.69, so integers less than that are 1-6, which L

---------------

CM(1-6)=60 divides 300. So that works too, but 420 is larger. So moving

---------------

 on.

Wait, let's check m=5. The maximum n was 180. That's less than 420, so not

---------------

 the maximum. Similarly for lower m's. So perhaps m=7 gives 420. But let's check m=7 is

---------------

 indeed the maximum m where LCM(1..m) < (m+1)^3.

Wait, LCM(1..7)=420.

---------------

 (m+1)^3=8^3=512. 420 < 512, so that works. For m=8, LCM(1..8)=840 vs

---------------

 9^3=729. 840>729, so that's why m=8 is

---------------

 invalid. So the maximum m is 7. Therefore, the maximum n is 420.

But wait, hold

---------------

 on. Let me check m=4. For m=4, n=120. But 120 is less than 60's

---------------

 n=180, etc. So 420 is the highest so far. Wait, but perhaps m=7 is the last

---------------

 valid m. But let me check m=7 and see if there's a higher n possible.

Wait, the problem is asking for the largest n such that n is divisible by every integer less than ∛n. So even

---------------

 if m is 7, but if there exists an n larger than 420 that still meets the condition, then

---------------

 that would be better. Wait, but according to our earlier logic, for m=7, n must be less than 512. So

---------------

 420 is the maximum n for m=7. But maybe there is an n between 420 and 512 that

---------------

 is divisible by all numbers less than its cube root?

Wait, let's suppose n is 420 < n <512. Let me pick

---------------

 n=420 +k, where k is between 1 and 91. Let's see if such an n could have

---------------

 ∛n less than 8 (so m=7 still applies), but also that all numbers less than ∛n divide it. Wait

---------------

, but if n is between 420 and 512, then ∛n is between ~7.5 and 8. So the integers less than ∛n would still be 1 through 7 or

---------------

 up to 7. So to be divisible by all up to 7, it still has to be divisible by LCM(1-7)=420. Therefore, any n in that range divisible by all numbers less than ∛n must be a multiple of 420. Since 420×2=840 is

---------------

 over 512, the only multiple is 420 itself. So indeed, 420 is the maximum for m=7.

Alternatively

---------------

, could there be an n between 420 and 512 that is divisible by all numbers less than its cube root, which would

---------------

 be less than 8, but perhaps not all the way up to 7?

Wait, for example, suppose n is 432. Then ∛432 is approximately 7.55, so integers less than that are 1-7. So 

---------------

432 must be divisible by all 1-7. Let's check if 7 divides 432. 432 divided by 7 is approximately

---------------

 61.71, which is not an integer. So 432 isn't divisible by 7. So

---------------

 that won't work.

How about 420? That works. What about 504? ∛504 is about

---------------

 7.96, so integers less than that are still up to 7. 504 divided by 7 is 72, so yes

---------------

, divisible by 7. Also, LCM(1-7)=420 divides into 504? Wait, 504 divided by 420 is 1.2, so no. So

---------------

 LCM(1-7)=420 doesn't divide 504, but maybe 504 is divisible by all numbers up to 7?

Check divis

---------------

ibility by 1-7:

1: yes.

2: 504 even, yes.

3: 5+0+4=9, divisible by 3.

4: last two digits 04, 04 divisible by 4? 04 is 4, yes.

5: last digit 4, no. Wait 504 ends with 4, so not divisible by 5. So

---------------

 5 doesn't divide 504, so that's a problem.

Ah right, so 504 is not divisible by 5, so that fails. So

---------------

 504 can't be considered.

Hmm, so maybe 420 is indeed the maximum. Let me check another number.

---------------

 Let's see 480. ∛480 is about 7.8. So again, need to check 1-7.

480 divisible by 1: yes.

2: yes.

3: 4+8+0=12, yes.

4: last two digits 80, which is divisible by 4.

5: last digit 0, yes.

6: yes, since divisible by 2 and 3.

7: 480 divided by 7 is about

---------------

 68.57. Not integer. So no. So 480 not divisible by 7.

Hmm

---------------

, so 420 is the only one in that range divisible by all up to 7. So 420 is the maximum for m=7.

Wait

---------------

, but let me check 210. Wait, 210 is less than 420, so not helpful

---------------

. Alternatively, let me check if m=7 gives 420, but maybe there's a higher m where even

---------------

 though LCM(1..m) is larger than (m+1)^3, but perhaps for a higher m, there

---------------

's a way?

Wait, m=7 gives n=420. Let me check m=10 just to

---------------

 see, but probably not. Let's see, m=10 would require LCM(1-10)=2520, which is way larger than 11^3=1331, so no

---------------

.

Alternatively, maybe m=7 is indeed the maximum. So the answer is 420? Wait, but wait

---------------

, let me check m=7's n=420 and see if there's a higher n for lower m?



---------------

Wait, for example, m=6 gives n=300. m=5 gives 180, etc

---------------

. So 420 is the largest so far. But wait, let me check m=4 gives n=120, m=3 gives 60, etc. So 420 is the largest

---------------

 so far. But let me check m=7 again.

Wait, another thought: perhaps if m is 7, n

---------------

 can be up to 511 (since less than 512). But maybe there's a number between 420 and 512 that is divisible by all numbers less than its cube root,

---------------

 but the cube root might be higher? For example, suppose n=504. Its cube root is about 7.96, so less

---------------

 than 8, so m=7 still applies. But 504 is not divisible by 5 or 7? Wait 504 is divisible by 7? Let me recalculate:

---------------

 7×72=504. Yes, 7 divides 504. Wait, but 5 divides

---------------

 504? 504 divided by 5 is 100.8, so no. So 

---------------

5 doesn't divide 504, so it's invalid. So even though it is divisible by 7, it's not divisible by 5, which is required.

---------------

 So that's not valid.

What about 420? 420 is divisible by 5, yes. 420/5=84. So that

---------------

's okay. 420 is divisible by all up to 7. So that's the maximum. 

Wait, let

---------------

 me check n=840. But n=840 would be in m=9, since cube root of 840 is about 9.4, so m=9, but L

---------------

CM(1-9) is 2520, which is way larger than 10^3=1000? Wait, 

---------------

2520>1000? Yes, so LCM(1-9)=2520,

---------------

 which is more than 10^3=1000. Therefore, no n exists for m=9. So 

---------------

420 is the maximum.

But wait, hold on. Let me check m=7 and see if n=420 is indeed the maximum. But

---------------

 let me think if there's a case where m is less than 7, but the n can be higher than 420.

---------------

 For example, m=6 gives n=300, which is less than 420. So no.

Wait another thought

---------------

: maybe there is a number larger than 420 but still less than 512 that is divisible by all numbers up to some

---------------

 m where m is higher than 7? Wait, but m can't be higher than 7 because if n is between

---------------

 343 and 512, the cube root is between 7 and 8, so m=7. So

---------------

 m can't be higher. So any n in that interval must have m=7, so must be divisible by all up to 7. So

---------------

 420 is the only one in that interval divisible by all up to 7. So that's the maximum.

Wait, but let

---------------

 me check n=840. Wait, n=840 is beyond the cube of 9, which is 729. But

---------------

 cube root of 840 is about 9.4, so m would be 9. But LCM(1-9)=2520, which is way

---------------

 bigger than 10^3=1000, so 840 isn't divisible by all numbers up to 9. For

---------------

 example, 8 divides 840 (yes), 9 divides 840? 8+4+0=12, which isn't divisible by 9, so 840/9=93.333,

---------------

 not integer. So 840 isn't divisible by 9, so that's invalid.

Hmm. So I think 420 is the answer

---------------

. Wait, but I recall that in some similar problems, the answer is 420, but let me check my

---------------

 calculations again.

Wait, let me check for m=7 again:

LCM(1-7)=420. The

---------------

 upper limit is 8^3=512. So maximum multiple of 420 below 512 is 420×

---------------

1=420, since 420×2=840>512. So that's correct. So n

---------------

=420.

Is there a higher n with a lower m? For example, if m=6, the upper limit is 343. The maximum n there was 300. 

---------------

300 <420, so no. For m=5, 180. So no.

Wait, but

---------------

 let me check m=4 gives n=120, which is lower. So yes, 420 is the largest so

---------------

 far.

Wait a second, but what about n=840? Wait, that's not in the m=9 case

---------------

, which is invalid. Alternatively, is there a number between 512 and 729 (for m=8) but

---------------

 since m=8 is invalid, there's no n there. So 420 is indeed the maximum.

Wait, but I

---------------

 just thought of another angle. Suppose n is 840, but m would be 9 (since cube root of 840 is ~9.4), so m

---------------

=9. But LCM(1-9)=2520, which is way bigger than 10^3=1000, so there

---------------

's no n for m=9. So no.

Alternatively, maybe there's a number between 216 and 343 (m=6)

---------------

 that is higher than 300 but still divisible by all numbers up to 6? Let's see. For example, 300 is the maximum multiple of LCM(1-6)=60 below

---------------

 343. 60×5=300, 60×6=360 which is over 343. So 300 is the maximum. So

---------------

 yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's another number between 300 and 343 that is divisible by all numbers up to 6 but

---------------

 not necessarily a multiple of 60? Wait, but LCM(1-6)=60, so any number divisible by all numbers up to 6 must be a multiple of 60. So no

---------------

, that can't happen. So 300 is the max.

Therefore, my conclusion is that 420 is the largest such n.

Wait, but hold

---------------

 on. Wait, let me check n=840 again. Wait, cube root of 840 is about

---------------

 9.4, so m=9. The LCM(1-9)=2520. Since 2520 is bigger

---------------

 than 10^3=1000, so no n exists for m=9. So that's invalid.

Another

---------------

 check: let me think if there is a number between 420 and 512 that is divisible by all numbers up to 7 but

---------------

 not necessarily a multiple of 420. Since LCM(1-7)=420, any number divisible by all numbers up to 7 must be a multiple of 420. Therefore

---------------

, the next multiple would be 840, which is too big. Therefore, 420 is indeed the maximum.



---------------

Wait, but let me check n=420's cube root. Cube root of 420 is approximately 7.5, so less

---------------

 than 8, so m=7, so that's okay. All numbers less than 7.5 (i.e., up to 7) divide 420. So

---------------

 yes, that works.

Wait, but wait, let me check n=840 again. Suppose someone says 840 is divisible by all numbers up to cube

---------------

 root of 840 which is ~9.4, so up to 9. But 840 is not divisible by 9,

---------------

 so it fails. So that's not valid.

Therefore, I think 420 is correct. However, I have

---------------

 a doubt because I remember a similar problem where the answer was 420, but let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 m=7 gives n=420, but maybe there is another m where n can be higher? Wait, let

---------------

 me check m=7 again. The maximum n for m=7 is 420. The next possible n would

---------------

 be in m=8, but there's no n there. So yes, 420 is the maximum. Therefore

---------------

, the answer should be 420.

Wait, but let me check another example. Let's think of n=840. Wait

---------------

, no, as above, it's invalid. Alternatively, n=2520? The cube root of 2520 is about 13.6, so m=13. LCM(1-13) is a

---------------

 huge number, way larger than 14^3=2744, so no.

Alternatively, n= L

---------------

CM(1-7)=420, which is the maximum possible. So I think that is correct.

Wait, but let

---------------

 me check the problem again to ensure I didn't misinterpret it.

The problem says: "the largest integer n such that n is divisible by every integer less than the cube root of n".

So for

---------------

 each n, compute the cube root, take all integers less than that, and n must be divisible by each of them. So

---------------

 for n=420, the cube root is ~7.5, so integers 1-7 must divide 420, which they do. For

---------------

 n=420, that's okay. If there's a larger n, say 420 < n <512, then

---------------

 its cube root is still less than 8, so the divisors required are still 1-7, but n must be divisible by all of them. Since LCM(1-7)=420, the

---------------

 next multiple would be 840, which is beyond 512. Therefore, no such n exists between 420 and 512. So

---------------

 420 is indeed the maximum.

Therefore, I think the answer is 420. Wait, but hold

---------------

 on, I just found a contradiction in my previous thought. Let me check m=7 again.

Wait, LCM(1-7)=420. So

---------------

 any number divisible by 1-7 must be a multiple of 420. So the next multiple after 420 is 840, which is over

---------------

 512, so indeed 420 is the maximum for m=7. So yes.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is 420.

Wait, but wait

---------------

 a second. Let me check an example of n=840. Let me see if it satisfies the condition. The cube root of 840 is approximately 9.43. Therefore, integers

---------------

 less than that are 1 through 9. Therefore, n must be divisible by all numbers from 1 to 9. But

---------------

 LCM(1-9)=2520. Since 840 is less than 2520, it cannot be divisible by all numbers up to 9. For

---------------

 example, 8 divides 840 (840/8=105), yes. 9 divides 840? 840 divided by 9 is 93.333...,

---------------

 which is not an integer. So no. Therefore, 840 is invalid.

So yeah, my conclusion is that

---------------

 420 is the answer.

Wait, but I just thought of another thing. Let me check n=840 again

---------------

 but in a different way. If someone claims that n=840 is divisible by all numbers less than its cube root.

---------------

 The cube root is ~9.43, so numbers less than that are up to 9. Since 840 isn't divisible by 9, it

---------------

's invalid. So that's not.

Alternatively, what about n= 2520? Its cube root is about

---------------

 13.6, so needs to be divisible by 1-13. But LCM(1-13) is 360360, which is way bigger than 14^3=2744, so n

---------------

=2520 is not divisible by all numbers up to 13. For example, 11 divides 2520? 2520/11≈

---------------

229.09, so no. So that's invalid.

Therefore, I think 420 is correct.

Wait, but let

---------------

 me check m=7 again. Let me confirm LCM(1-7)=420. Let me compute L

---------------

CM step by step:

LCM(1,2)=2

LCM(2,3)=6

LCM(6,4)=12 (since 6 and 4 have LCM 12)

LCM(12,5)=60

LCM(60,6)=60 (since 60 is already divisible by 6)

LCM(60,7)=420. Yes, that's correct.

So L

---------------

CM(1-7)=420. So that's right.

Therefore, the maximum n is 420. So

---------------

 I think the answer is 420. Wait, but I have a doubt because I recall another problem where the answer was 840. Maybe

---------------

 different conditions? Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering m=7. Let me check n=840 again

---------------

. The cube root of 840 is about 9.43, so the numbers less than that are up to 9. So

---------------

 n must be divisible by 1-9. But LCM(1-9)=2520, which is larger

---------------

 than 840, so 840 can't be divisible by all numbers up to 9. Therefore, 

---------------

840 is invalid. Therefore, 420 is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps m=7 gives 420, but m

---------------

=6 gives 300, so 420 is the largest. So I think that is correct. Therefore

---------------

, the answer should be 420.

Wait, but let me check for m=7, the cube root of n is less

---------------

 than 8, so n can be up to 511. So if I can find a number between 420 and 511 that is divisible by all numbers up to 7, then

---------------

 that would be better. Let's try 420+420=840, which is too big. So

---------------

 no. The next multiple would be 840, which is too big. So there is no other multiple of 420 in

---------------

 that interval. Therefore, 420 is indeed the maximum.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is 420. So

---------------

 I should write that as the final answer.

**Final Answer**
Answer: 420


To find the largest integer \( n \) such that \( n \) is divisible by every integer less than \( \sqrt[3]{n} \), we need

---------------

 to consider the following steps:

1. **Define \( m \) as the integer part of \( \sqrt[3]{n} \)**:
   - For each \( m \), \( n \) must be in the interval \( [m^3, (m+1)^3) \).
   - \( n \) must be divisible by all integers from 1 to \( m \).

2. **Calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM)**:
   - For each \( m \), compute the LCM of all integers from 1 to \( m \).
   - The maximum \( n \) for each \( m \) is the largest multiple of this LCM that is less than \( (m+1)^3 \).

3. **Check for

---------------

 valid \( m \)**:
   - Continue this process for increasing values of \( m \) until the LCM of 

---------------

1 to \( m \) exceeds \( (m+1)^3 \).

**Detailed Calculations**:

- **For \( m = 1 \)**:
  - LCM(1) = 1
  - Maximum \( n \) is 7 (since \( n

---------------

 < 8 \))

- **For \( m = 2 \)**:
  - LCM(1, 2) = 2
  - Maximum \( n \) is 26 (since \( n < 27 \))

- **For \( m = 3 \)**:
  - LCM(1, 2, 3) = 6
  - Maximum \( n \) is 60 (since \( n < 64 \))

- **For \( m = 4 \)**:
  - LCM(1, 2, 3, 4) = 12
  - Maximum \( n \) is 120 (since \( n < 125 \))

- **For \( m = 5 \)**:
  - LCM(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) = 60
  - Maximum \( n \) is 180 (since \( n < 216 \))

- **For \( m = 6 \)**:
  - LCM(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) = 60
  - Maximum \( n \) is 300 (since \( n < 343 \))

- **For \( m = 7 \)**:
  - LCM(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) = 420
  - Maximum \( n \) is 420 (since \( n < 512 \))

- **For \( m = 8 \)**:
  - LCM(1, 2, ..., 8) = 840, which exceeds \( (8+1)^3 = 729 \), so no valid \( n \).

The highest valid \( n \) found is 420 for \( m = 7 \). Checking higher

---------------

 \( m \) values (e.g., \( m = 8 \)) shows no valid \( n \).

Thus, the largest integer \( n \) divisible by every integer less than \( \sqrt[3]{n} \) is:

\[
\boxed{420}
