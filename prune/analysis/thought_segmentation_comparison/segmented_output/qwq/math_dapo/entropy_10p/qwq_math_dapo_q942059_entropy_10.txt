Okay, so I need to find the number of bad integers between 100 and 200 that are congruent to 3 mod 4. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. 

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. A "bad" integer is one that can't be turned into a valid time on a 12-hour digital clock by inserting a colon somewhere in its digits. A "good" one can be. For example, 100 is good because you

---------------

 can write 1:00, but 164 is bad because inserting a colon anywhere (like 1:64 or 16:4) isn't a valid time. 

The task is to count how many numbers

---------------

 between 100 and 200 (so from 100 up to 199, since 200 is excluded

---------------

 because it's not less than 200? Wait, actually, the problem says between 100 and 200, so does that include 200? Hmm, the

---------------

 wording says "between 100 and 200", which sometimes can be ambiguous. But since the example given is 100 and

---------------

 164, and 200 is mentioned as an example, maybe they mean up to 199? Let

---------------

 me check the problem again. It says "between 100 and 200", so probably 100 ≤ x ≤ 199. Since

---------------

 200 would be a three-digit number starting with 2, but on a 12-hour clock, the hours go up to 12, so numbers starting with 2 would have to be 12,

---------------

 so 200 might not be considered here. So maybe we are dealing with numbers from 100 to 199 inclusive. 



---------------

Also, the numbers need to be equivalent to 3 mod 4. So first, I need to consider all numbers between 100 and 199 that are 3 mod 4, then among those, determine

---------------

 which are "bad" (i.e., cannot form a valid time by inserting a colon). 

Let me start by figuring out which

---------------

 numbers between 100-199 are congruent to 3 mod 4. 

First, numbers between 100 and 199:

---------------

 all are three-digit numbers starting with 1. So they are of the form 1AB, where A and B are digits (0-9). 

First

---------------

, let's find all numbers 1AB where 1AB ≡ 3 mod 4. 

To compute 1AB mod 4, note that 

---------------

100 mod 4 is 0 (since 100 is divisible by 4). So 1AB mod 4 is equal to (10*A + B) mod 4. Because

---------------

 100 ≡ 0 mod4, so 100 + 10A + B ≡ 10A + B mod4. 

Therefore, 

---------------

10A + B ≡ 3 mod4. 

So, for each number 1AB (from 100 to 199), the

---------------

 last two digits (the tens and units place) must form a number (10A + B) that is congruent to 3 mod4. 

Therefore, the

---------------

 problem reduces to first listing all numbers from 100 to 199 where the last two digits form a number (

---------------

from 00 to 99) that is ≡3 mod4. 

Then, among those numbers, we need to find

---------------

 which are "bad"—meaning you can't insert a colon to make a valid time. 

So first step: list all numbers 1AB where 10A + B ≡3 mod4. 

Second

---------------

 step: for each such number, check if it's possible to insert a colon to form a valid time. If not, count it as bad. 

Then

---------------

, total bad numbers in that set will be the answer. 

First, let's tackle the first part: identifying all numbers between 100-199 where

---------------

 the last two digits (the number formed by the tens and units digit) ≡3 mod4. 

Let me note

---------------

 that 10A + B ≡3 mod4. Since A and B are digits (0-9), 10A + B can be from 0 to 99. 

So

---------------

, 10A + B ≡3 mod4. 

We can write 10A + B ≡ 2A + B mod4 (since 10 ≡ 2 mod4, so 10A mod4 = (2A mod4), so 10A + B mod4 = (2A + B) mod4). 

Therefore, 2A + B ≡3 mod4. 

So

---------------

, for each A (0-9) and B (0-9), if 2A + B ≡3 mod4, then the number 1AB is in our set

---------------

. 

Alternatively, for each A from 0 to 9, B must satisfy B ≡ (3 - 2A) mod4. 

So

---------------

 for each A, possible B values are those that are congruent to (3 - 2A) mod4. Since B is a digit (0-9), there

---------------

 will be 2 or 3 possible B's for each A. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to iterate through all possible A and B.

---------------

 

But maybe first, let's compute for each A from 0 to 9:

Let me list A from 0 to 9, and for each A, find B such that 2A + B ≡3 mod4. 

Starting with A=0:

A=0: 2*0 + B ≡3 mod4 ⇒ B ≡3 mod4 ⇒ B can be 3,7 (

---------------

since 3 mod4 and 7 mod4 is 3). 

Wait, 3 mod4 is 3, 7 mod4 is 3. So

---------------

 B can be 3,7. 

But B is a digit, so 3,7. 

A=0,

---------------

 possible B: 3,7. 

A=1:

2*1 + B ≡3 mod4 ⇒ 2 + B ≡3 ⇒ B ≡1 mod4 ⇒ B can be 1,5,9. 

Since

---------------

 B is 0-9, so 1,5,9. 

A=2:

2*2 + B =4 + B ≡0 + B mod4 (since 4 mod4 is 0). So 0 + B ≡3 mod4 ⇒ B≡3 mod4 ⇒ same as A=0.

---------------

 So B=3,7.

A=3:

2*3 + B =6 + B. 6 mod4 is 2, so 2 + B ≡3 mod4 ⇒ B ≡1 mod4 ⇒ B

---------------

=1,5,9.

A=4:

2*4 =8, 8 mod4 is 0. So 0 + B ≡3 ⇒ B≡3 mod4 ⇒ B=3,7.

A=5:

2*5 =10 mod

---------------

4 is 2. So 2 + B ≡3 ⇒ B≡1 mod4 ⇒ B=1,5,9.

A=6:

2*6=12 mod4 is 0. 0 + B ≡3 ⇒ B≡3 mod4 ⇒ B=3,7.

A=7:

2*7=14 mod4 is 2. 2 + B ≡3 ⇒ B≡1 mod4 ⇒ B=1,5,9.

A=8:

2*8=16 mod4 is 0. 0 + B ≡3 ⇒ B≡3 mod4 ⇒ B=3,7.

A=9:

2*9=18 mod4 is 2 (since 18 divided

---------------

 by 4 is 4*4=16, remainder 2). So 2 + B ≡3 ⇒ B≡1 mod4 ⇒ B=1,5,9.

So summarizing:

For each A from 0-9, possible B's

---------------

:

A=0: B=3,7

A=1: B=1,5,9

A=2: B=3,7

A=3: B=1,5,9

A=4: B=3,7

A=5: B=1,5,9

A=6: B=3,7

A=7: B=1,5,9

A=8: B=3,7

A=9: B=1,5,9

Therefore, for each A, the number of B's is either 2 or 3. 

So

---------------

 total numbers in the set (1AB where 10A+B ≡3 mod4) would be:

For A even (0,2,4,6,8): each has 2 B's ⇒

---------------

 5 A's *2 =10

For A odd (1,3,5,7,9): each has 3 B's ⇒5 A's *3=15

Total numbers: 10+15=25 numbers. 

Wait, let me check

---------------

:

A=0: 2

A=1:3

A=2:2

A=3:3

A=4:2

A=5:3

A=6:2

A=7:3

A=8:2

A=9:3

Adding those

---------------

 up: (2+3)*5 = 5*5=25? Wait, 2+3 is 5, times

---------------

 5? Wait, no, actually there are 10 A's, so 5 even and 5 odd. So

---------------

 yes, 5*(2+3)=25. 

Therefore, there are 25 numbers between 100 and 199 that are ≡3 mod4. 

Now, among

---------------

 these 25 numbers, we need to find which are "bad"—i.e., cannot have a colon inserted to form a valid time on a 12-hour clock. 

First

---------------

, let me recall that on a 12-hour digital clock, the time is displayed as H:MM, where H is from 1 to 12, and MM is from 00 to 59. However, since we are dealing with numbers between 100 and 199, which

---------------

 are three-digit numbers starting with 1, inserting a colon would split them into either 1:AB or 1A:B,

---------------

 where A and B are digits. 

Wait, let's clarify: the number is 1AB (three digits). To form a time, we can insert a colon either after the first digit (making 

---------------

1:AB) or after the second digit (making 1A:B). 

Therefore, for each number 1AB, we can check both possibilities:

1. Split

---------------

 as 1:AB. This would mean the hour is 1, and the minutes are AB. To be valid, the minutes (AB) must be between 00 and 59. Since A is the tens digit of the minutes, A must be 0-5. Because

---------------

 if the minutes are AB, then A (the second digit of the original number) must be between 0 and 5 (

---------------

since minutes can't be 60-99). 

2. Split as 1A:B. Here, the hour is 1A (the first two digits) and the minutes are B (the third digit). The

---------------

 hour must be between 1 and 12. Since the first digit is 1, the hour is 1 followed by A. So the hour is 10 + A (since it

---------------

's the digits '1' and 'A'). Therefore, the hour must be between 1 and 12. Since the first digit is 1, the maximum hour is

---------------

 19 (if A=9), but 19 is over 12, so actually, the hour can

---------------

 be from 10 to 19, but on a 12-hour clock, the hours go up to 12. So the

---------------

 hour (1A) must be between 1 and 12. Since it's 1 followed by A, the

---------------

 possible values are 10,11,12 (since 1 followed by 0 is 10, 1 is 11, 2 is 12; beyond

---------------

 that, like 13 would be 1 followed by 3, but 13 is over 12). 

Wait, so

---------------

 for the hour part when splitting as 1A:B, the hour is the first two digits: 1A. Since

---------------

 the original number starts with 1, the first two digits are 1 and A. So the hour is 10 + A. Therefore

---------------

, to be a valid hour, 10 + A must be between 1 and 12. 

But since 10 + A must

---------------

 be at least 10 (since A is a digit 0-9), the possible values of the hour (1A) are 10, 11, or 12. So

---------------

:

- If A is 0: 10 (valid)
- If A is 1: 11 (valid)
- If A is 2: 12 (valid)
- If A is 3-9: 13-19, which are invalid on

---------------

 a 12-hour clock. 

Therefore, when splitting as 1A:B, the hour is valid only if A is 0,1, or 2. Additionally

---------------

, the minutes part (B) must be between 00 and 59. Since B is a single digit, the

---------------

 minutes would be 0-9, which is okay (since 0-9 minutes are valid; but actually, minutes must

---------------

 be two digits, so if we split as 1A:B, then the minutes would be just B, but on a clock, minutes are two digits, so perhaps

---------------

 that's an issue? Wait, hold on. 

Wait, the problem says "insert a colon among the digits to form a time of day on a twelve-hour digital clock". A

---------------

 digital clock would display times like 1:00, 12:34, etc. So minutes must be two digits. Therefore, if

---------------

 you split as 1A:B, the minutes would only be one digit (just B), which is invalid because minutes need to be two digits. Therefore

---------------

, actually, splitting as 1A:B would only be valid if the minutes part is two digits, but since the original number is three digits, inserting a colon after the second digit gives 

---------------

1A:B, which is H:MM where H is 1A (two digits) and MM is B (one digit). Since

---------------

 MM must be two digits, that's invalid. Wait, but maybe leading zeros are allowed? 

Wait, on a digital clock, single

---------------

-digit minutes are displayed with a leading zero, like 1:05. So perhaps when splitting as 1A:B, the minutes would

---------------

 be "B" but written as "0B". But the original number is 1AB, so inserting a colon after the second digit gives 1A:B, which would be

---------------

 H:MM where H is 1A and MM is B. But since MM is only one digit, that's not valid

---------------

 unless B is considered as 0B. Hmm, but the problem says "insert a colon among the digits", so you

---------------

 can't add a zero. You have to use the digits as they are. 

Therefore, splitting as 1A:B would result

---------------

 in minutes being a single digit, which is invalid because the minutes must be two digits. Therefore, that split is invalid unless B is actually

---------------

 two digits, but since it's a single digit, that's not possible. 

Wait, maybe I need to check the problem's example again. The example given is 100 is good because you can write 1:00. So inserting the colon after the first digit: 1:00. The

---------------

 minutes here are 00, which is two digits. 

Similarly, if you have a number like 123, inserting a colon after the first digit would be 1:23 (valid), or after the second digit would be 12:3, which is invalid because minutes are

---------------

 only 3, not two digits. So, only the first split is valid here. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that when inserting a colon,

---------------

 the minutes must be two digits. Therefore, for the split 1A:B, the minutes would only be one digit (B), so that's invalid. Therefore, the

---------------

 only valid split is when the minutes are two digits, meaning the colon is inserted after the first digit (resulting in H:MM where H is 1 and MM is AB), or after the second digit but only if the minutes part is two digits. Wait, but inserting after the second digit gives the

---------------

 minutes as the third digit, which is one digit. Therefore, the only valid splits are either:

1. 1:AB (so

---------------

 the minutes are AB, two digits), which requires that AB is between 00 and 59. 

2. 1A:B (

---------------

the hour is 1A, which must be between 1 and 12, and the minutes are B, but since minutes must be two digits, this is only valid if B is two

---------------

 digits, which it's not. Therefore, this split is invalid. 

Wait, but the problem says "insert a colon among the digits",

---------------

 so perhaps leading zeros are allowed? For example, if the number is 110, inserting after the second digit gives 11:0, which could

---------------

 be interpreted as 11:00? But the original number is 110, so inserting a colon would be

---------------

 11:0, but that's not the same as 11:00. Since you can't add a zero. So

---------------

 minutes have to be exactly the digits after the colon. 

Therefore, in order for the split after the second digit (1A:B) to be valid, the minutes must be two digits, so B

---------------

 must be two digits? But B is a single digit. Therefore, that split is invalid. Therefore, only the first split (1:AB) is a possible valid time, except when the hour part is 

---------------

1A (if that is a valid hour, but with minutes being two digits). Wait, maybe there's another way.

---------------

 Wait, if the number is, say, 123, inserting a colon after the first digit gives 1:23 (valid), inserting after the second gives 12:3 (invalid). But

---------------

 if the number is 102, inserting after the second digit gives 10:2, which is invalid because

---------------

 minutes are 02 (if you consider leading zero, but the original number's digits are 1,0,2,

---------------

 so inserting after the second digit would be 10:2, which is 10:02 if we add

---------------

 a leading zero? But the problem states "insert a colon among the digits"—so you can't add digits, only insert the colon. So 10:2 would have

---------------

 minutes as "2", which is one digit, so invalid. 

Therefore, the only valid way to form a time is to

---------------

 split after the first digit, giving H:MM where H is 1, and MM is the last two digits (AB). 



---------------

Alternatively, if the number is such that splitting after the second digit gives a valid hour (between 1-12) and the minutes part

---------------

 is two digits? Wait, but the minutes part would only be one digit. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think again. 



---------------

Suppose the number is 123. Inserting after the first digit gives 1:23 (valid). Inserting after the second digit gives 12:3. But

---------------

 12 is a valid hour, but 3 is only one digit for minutes. Since minutes must be two digits, 

---------------

12:3 is invalid. 

However, if the number is 112, inserting after the second digit gives 11:2. Again, minutes are

---------------

 one digit. 

Wait, but maybe if the minutes part is a single digit, but leading zero is assumed? Like 12:3 would be 12:03. However, the problem states

---------------

 that you have to insert a colon among the digits, so you can't add a zero. Therefore, the minutes must be exactly the digits after the colon. 



---------------

Therefore, the only valid splits are those where the minutes are two digits, so the colon must be placed such that the minutes part is two digits. Since

---------------

 the original number is three digits, the only way to have two digits for minutes is to split after the first digit (so

---------------

 the first digit is the hour, next two are minutes). 

Alternatively, if the hour part is two digits (like 12), then the minutes part would

---------------

 be the third digit, but that's only one digit, so invalid. 

Therefore, the only possible valid time is when splitting

---------------

 after the first digit, resulting in 1:AB, which requires that AB is between 00 and 59. 

Wait

---------------

, but there is another possibility: if the number is between 100-199, the hour could be 10, 11, or 12,

---------------

 right? For example, the number 123 could also be split as 12:3, but that's invalid because

---------------

 minutes are one digit, but 12:03 would be different. Alternatively, maybe the problem allows leading zeros in the minutes? 



---------------

Wait, let me check the problem's example again. The example given is 100 is good because we can write 1:00. That uses

---------------

 the first split: 1:00. The other split would be 10:0, which is 10 hours and 0 minutes, but written as 10:0, but on

---------------

 a digital clock, it would be 10:00, but you can't add the zero. Therefore, the

---------------

 problem requires that the digits as split form a valid time without adding digits. 

Therefore, the split 10:0 would be

---------------

 10 hours and 0 minutes, which would be written as 10:0, but since minutes must be two digits, that

---------------

's invalid. Therefore, only splits where the minutes are two digits are valid, which requires the colon to be after the first digit. 

Therefore, the only valid splits

---------------

 are those where the first digit is the hour (1, 2, ..., 9, but since the number starts with 1, it

---------------

's only 1), and the next two digits are minutes (00-59). Alternatively, if the hour is two digits (like 10, 11, 12), then the minutes must

---------------

 be two digits, so the number would have to have four digits? Wait, no, the numbers are three-digit, so inserting

---------------

 a colon after the first digit gives one digit hour and two digits minutes. Inserting after the second digit gives two digits hour and one digit minutes. Since the

---------------

 hour can be up to 12, but the two-digit hour would need to be 10, 11, or 12. 



---------------

Wait, perhaps the problem allows leading zeros for the hour? For example, if the number is 001, but since

---------------

 we're only considering numbers between 100 and 200, leading zeros aren't an issue here. 

Wait, maybe

---------------

 my initial conclusion is too restrictive. Let me think again. 

Suppose the number is 123. 

Possible

---------------

 splits:

1:23 (valid, since 1 is hour, 23 minutes)

12:3 (invalid, since minutes must

---------------

 be two digits, but here it's one digit)

So only the first split is valid. 

Another example, 11

---------------

0:

Split as 1:10 (valid), or 11:0 (invalid, minutes are one digit). So valid. 

Another example, 102:

Split as 1:02 (valid), or 10:2 (invalid). So valid. 

Another

---------------

 example, 1234 is a four-digit number, but we're dealing with three-digit numbers. 

Wait, what

---------------

 about a number like 129? 

Split as 1:29 (valid), or 12:9 (invalid). 

What

---------------

 about 109? 

1:09 or 10:9 (invalid). 

What about 13

---------------

0? Wait, 130 is between 100-199, but 130:

---------------

 inserting after first digit is 1:30 (valid), so it's good. 

Wait, but 130 is

---------------

 1 followed by 3 and 0, so splitting after first digit gives 1:30 which is valid. 

Now

---------------

, what about a number like 160? 

1:60. Wait, minutes can't be 60. So

---------------

 1:60 is invalid. So inserting after first digit gives invalid, inserting after second digit gives 16:0, which is invalid (hour

---------------

 16 is too big, and minutes 0 is one digit). Therefore, 160 would be bad? Wait, but 160 mod4?

---------------

 Let me check. 

Wait, but in our problem, we are only considering numbers ≡3 mod4. Let's see

---------------

. 160 divided by 4 is 40, so 160 mod4 is 0. So it's not in our set. 

But

---------------

 let's take an example from our set. Let's take a number in the set (≡3 mod4). Let's say 103. 

103 mod4: 103 divided by 4 is 25*4 + 3, so yes, 3 mod4. 

Now

---------------

, check if it's good or bad. 

Split after first digit: 1:03 (valid). So it's good. 

Another example: 111. Wait, 111 mod4: 111 mod

---------------

4 is 3 (since 112 is divisible by 4, so 111 mod4 is 3). 

Split

---------------

 after first digit: 1:11 (valid). So good. 

Another example: 133. Let's see 

---------------

133 mod4: 133 - 132=1, so 1 mod4? Wait, 132 is divisible by 4? 4*33=132, so 133 mod4 is 1. Not 3. 



---------------

Wait maybe 115. 115 mod4: 115 divided by 4 is 28*4=112, 115-112=3 ⇒ 3 mod4. 

Split after first digit: 1:15 (valid). So good. 

Hmm

---------------

, so some numbers in the set are good. 

Now, the bad numbers are those where neither split gives a valid time. 

So

---------------

, to be bad, both splits must be invalid. 

So, for a number 1AB:

Case 1: Split as 1:AB (

---------------

hour 1, minutes AB). To be invalid, AB must not be between 00 and 59. Since AB is the last two digits (from

---------------

 00 to 99), AB must be >=60. 

Case 2: Split as 1A:B (hour 1A, minutes B). To be invalid, either:

- Hour 1A is not between 1 and 12, or



---------------

- Minutes B is not between 00 and 59 (but since minutes must be two digits, actually, this

---------------

 split is invalid because minutes are only one digit. Wait, but as discussed earlier, minutes need to be two digits, so this

---------------

 split is automatically invalid unless we can have leading zeros, which we can't. 

Wait, actually, even if the hour is valid (10,11,12), the minutes part

---------------

 is only one digit, which is invalid. Therefore, the split after the second digit is always invalid for forming a valid time on

---------------

 a digital clock. 

Therefore, the only possible valid split is the first one (1:AB). Therefore, a number is good if AB is between 00 and 59, and bad otherwise. 

Wait, that

---------------

 seems to be the case. So, if the last two digits (AB) form a number from 00 to 59, then the

---------------

 number is good. If AB is 60-99, then it's bad. 

Therefore, the bad numbers in our set (≡

---------------

3 mod4) are those where AB (the last two digits) is 60-99. 

Therefore, to

---------------

 find the bad numbers in the set, we need to look at numbers 1AB where:

1. 10A + B ≡3 mod4 (so they

---------------

 are in our initial set)

AND

2. AB (i.e., 10A + B) ≥60. 

Therefore, the

---------------

 problem reduces to counting how many numbers 1AB (between 100-199) satisfy both:

- 10A + B ≡3 mod4,



---------------

AND

- 10A + B ≥60. 

Therefore, the steps now are:

1. From our earlier

---------------

 list of numbers where 10A + B ≡3 mod4 (total 25 numbers), count how many have AB (i.e., 10A + B) ≥60. 

Alternatively

---------------

, since we can represent AB as the number formed by the last two digits (from 00 to 99), so

---------------

 10A + B is the value of those two digits. So for each number in the set (the 25 numbers), check if 

---------------

10A + B ≥60. 

Alternatively, since we already categorized the possible A and B for each case, perhaps we can compute this without

---------------

 enumerating all 25 numbers. 

Let me think. 

First, note that AB (the last two digits) is from

---------------

 00 to 99. 

We need to find numbers where AB ≥60 and AB ≡3 mod4. 

So

---------------

 the total numbers in the set (≡3 mod4) with AB >=60 is equal to the numbers between 60 and 99 inclusive

---------------

 that are ≡3 mod4, and then considering their A and B values (since A is the tens digit and B is the units digit). 

Wait, but

---------------

 since we have already characterized the A and B for each case, maybe it's better to compute how many of the 25 numbers have AB >=60. 

Alternatively, let

---------------

's compute for each A from 0 to9, the possible B's that satisfy 2A + B ≡3 mod4 and 10A + B >=60. 

So let's go

---------------

 back to each A from 0-9 and see for each A, how many B's satisfy both conditions. 

Starting

---------------

 with A=0:

A=0: B must be 3 or7 (from earlier). 

AB = 03 (3) or 07 (7). Both are less than 60. So none qualify. 

A=1:

B can be 1,5,9. 

AB is

---------------

 11, 15, 19. All less than 60. None qualify. 

A=2:

B can be 3 or7. 

AB is 23 or 27. Both <60. 

A=3:

B can be 1,5,9. 

AB is

---------------

 31, 35, 39. All <60. 

A=4:

B can be 3 or7. 

AB is 43 or 47. Both <60. 

A=5:

B can be 1,5,9. 

AB is 51,55,59. 

Now

---------------

, 51,55,59: all are less than 60 except 59 is still 59. Wait, 59 is still less than 60. So none here qualify. 

Wait, 51,55,59 are all below

---------------

 60. So A=5 gives no qualifying B's. 

Wait, moving on. 

A=6:

B can be 3 or7. 

AB is 63 or 67. 

6

---------------

3 and 67 are both ≥60. So for A=6, B=3 and7 both qualify. 

So that

---------------

's 2 numbers here. 

A=7:

B can be 1,5,9. 

AB is 71,75,79. All are

---------------

 ≥60. 

So for A=7, all three B's (1,5,9) qualify. 

Thus

---------------

, 3 numbers here. 

A=8:

B can be 3 or7. 

AB is 83 or87. Both are ≥60. 

Thus, 2 numbers here. 

A=9:

B can be 1,5,9. 

AB is 91,95,99. All are ≥60. 

Thus, 3 numbers here. 

So now

---------------

, let's tally up the counts for each A:

A=0: 0

A=1:0

A=2:0

A=3:0

A=4:0

A=5:0

A=6:2

A=7:3

A=8:2

A=9:3

Total bad

---------------

 numbers: 2 +3 +2 +3 =10. 

Wait, let me check again:

A=6:2

A=7:3 →

---------------

 total so far 5

A=8:2 → 7

A=9:3 → total 10. 

Yes. 

Therefore, there are 10 numbers in the set (≡3 mod4 between 100-199) that have AB >=60, hence

---------------

 are bad. 

Wait but let me confirm with actual examples. 

Take A=6, B=3: the number is 163. 

Check AB=63,

---------------

 which is 63 >=60. 

Split as 1:63 → minutes 63 is invalid (since minutes can't be over 59). 



---------------

Split as 16:3 → invalid because minutes are single digit. So yes, 163 is bad. 

Similarly, A=6,B=7: 167 → AB=67 >=

---------------

60. 1:67 invalid, 16:7 invalid. Bad. 

A=7,B=1 →171 → AB=71. 1:71 invalid, 17:1 invalid (hour 17 is over 12). Wait, hold on! Wait, here

---------------

 is a problem. 

Wait, when we considered the split after the second digit (1A:B), the hour is 1A. For A=7, 1A is 17, which is over 12, so that split is invalid.

---------------

 

But even if the minutes were two digits, the hour is invalid. 

Wait, but in our earlier analysis, we said

---------------

 that the split after the second digit is invalid because the minutes are only one digit. 

However, even if the minutes were two digits (which

---------------

 they are not here), the hour would be 17 which is over 12. 

Therefore, even if the

---------------

 minutes were two digits, the hour is still invalid. 

But in this case, the minutes are single digit, so it

---------------

's invalid either way. 

But in any case, the only possible valid split is 1:AB, which for AB=71 is invalid because 71 minutes is too much. So yes, 171 is bad. 

Similarly, A=7, B=5: 175 → AB=75.

---------------

 1:75 invalid. 

A=7,B=9 →179 → same. 

A=8,B=3 →183 → AB=83.

---------------

 1:83 invalid. 

A=8,B=7 →187 → AB=87 invalid. 

A=9,B=1 →191 → AB=91 invalid. 

A=9,B=5 →195 → AB=95 invalid. 

A=9,B=9 →199 → AB=99 invalid. 

All these numbers

---------------

 are indeed bad. 

So total of 10 numbers. 

Wait, but let me check A=5. 



---------------

Earlier, for A=5, B can be 1,5,9. 

AB would be 51,55,59. All less

---------------

 than 60, so they are good. 

Similarly, A=6,B=3 and7: 63 and67.

---------------

 Those are the first ones over 60. 

Therefore, the total count is indeed 2+3+2+3=10. 

Therefore, the answer should be 10. 

But let me just

---------------

 cross-verify once more by listing all 25 numbers and then counting those with AB >=60. 

First, let's list all 25 numbers.

---------------

 

Starting with A=0:

A=0:

B=3 → 103

B=7 → 107

A=1:

B=1 →111

B=5 →115

B=9 →119

A=2:

B=3 →123

B=7 →127

A=3:

B=1 →131

B=5 →135

B=9 →139

A=4:

B=3 →143

B=7 →147

A=5:

B=1 →151

B=5 →155

B=9 →159

A=6:

B=3 →163

B=7 →167

A=7:

B=1 →171

B=5 →175

B=9 →179

A=8:

B=3 →183

B=7 →187

A=9:

B=1 →191

B=5 →195

B=9 →199

So that

---------------

's 25 numbers. 

Now, let's go through each and see if they are bad (i.e., AB >=60):

1

---------------

03: AB=03 → 3 <60 → good

107: AB=07 →7 <60 → good

111: 11 <60 → good

115:15 <60 → good

119:19 <60 → good

123:23 <60 → good

127:27 <60 → good

131:31 <60 → good

135:35 <60 → good

139:39 <60 → good

143:43 <60 → good

147:47 <60 → good

151:51 <60 → good

155:55 <60 → good

159:59 <60 → good

163:63 ≥60 → bad

167:67 ≥60 → bad

171:71 ≥60 → bad

175:75 ≥60 → bad

179:79 ≥60 → bad

183:83 ≥60 → bad

187:87 ≥60 → bad

191:91 ≥60 → bad

195:95 ≥60 → bad

199:99 ≥60 → bad

Now, count the bad ones:

Starting from 163 onward

---------------

:

163,167,171,175,179,183,187,191,195,199 → that's 10 numbers. 

Yes, exactly 10. 

Therefore, the answer is 10. 

**Final Answer**
Answer: 10


To determine the number of bad integers between 100 and 199 that are equivalent to 3 mod 4, we first identify all

---------------

 such numbers. A number \(1AB\) (where \(A\) and \(B\) are digits) is congruent to 3 mod 4 if \(10A + B \equiv 3 \pmod{4}\). This simplifies to \(2A + B \equiv 3 \pmod{4}\). 

We analyze each possible value of \(A\) (0-9) to find valid \(B\) values:

- For \(A = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8\), \(B\) must be 3 or 7.
- For \(A = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9\), \(B\) must be 1, 5, or 9.

This results in 25 numbers. Next, we check if these numbers are "bad" by ensuring they cannot form a valid time when

---------------

 inserting a colon. A valid time must have minutes between 00 and 59 when split as \(1:AB\). Thus, a

---------------

 number is bad if \(AB \geq 60\).

Checking each number:
- Numbers with \(A = 6, 7, 8, 9\) and corresponding \(B\) values yield

---------------

 \(AB \geq 60\).

Counting these:
- \(A = 6\): 163, 167 (2 numbers)
- \(A = 7\): 171, 175, 179 (3 numbers)
- \(A = 8\): 183, 187 (2 numbers)
- \(A = 9\): 191, 195, 199 (3 numbers)

Total bad numbers: \(2 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 10\).
