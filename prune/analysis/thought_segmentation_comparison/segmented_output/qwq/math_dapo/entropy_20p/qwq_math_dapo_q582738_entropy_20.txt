Okay, so I need to figure out the maximum number of points that could be in the domain of Lana's function f(x) = x², given that the range is exactly {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. Hmm, let's break

---------------

 this down step by step. 

First, the function is defined only on a finite set of x-values, and for each x in the domain, f(x) = x². The range has

---------------

 to cover all the numbers from 0 to 9 inclusive. That means every number from 0 through 9 must be achievable

---------------

 by squaring some x in the domain. But since the domain is finite, we have to make sure that each of these numbers

---------------

 is hit by at least one x, but also, we want to maximize the number of x's in the domain. 

So, the

---------------

 key here is probably to figure out for each y in the range {0,1,...,9}, how many different x's can map to it. Since the

---------------

 function is f(x)=x², each y in the range can be achieved by x = sqrt(y) or x = -sqrt(y). However, since

---------------

 we want the domain to have as many points as possible, we should include both the positive and negative roots whenever possible. But we

---------------

 have to make sure that all the required y-values are covered. 

Let me list out the y-values and their possible x's:

- y=0: Only

---------------

 x=0, since 0 squared is 0. There's no negative counterpart here because -0 is the same as 0. So only

---------------

 one x-value here.

- y=1: x can be 1 or -1. So two possible x-values.

- y=2: Hmm, sqrt

---------------

(2) is irrational, right? So there's no integer x such that x²=2. Wait, but the

---------------

 problem doesn't say the domain has to consist of integers. Wait a second, hold on. The problem says "finitely many values x", but it

---------------

 doesn't specify they have to be integers. Wait, that complicates things. Wait, but the range is given as integers

---------------

 from 0 to 9. So if the function is f(x)=x², then to get an integer y, the x's

---------------

 must be either integers or square roots of integers. But if x is allowed to be any real number, then for each y in 0-9, there

---------------

 are two real numbers x: sqrt(y) and -sqrt(y), except for y=0, which only has x=0. 



---------------

However, the problem says the domain consists of finitely many values. So, if we can choose any real numbers, but

---------------

 need the range to be exactly those integers, then to get each y from 0 to 9, we need at least one x such

---------------

 that x² = y. But since the problem says the domain is finite, but the question is asking for the maximum number of points in the domain. To

---------------

 maximize the domain, we need to include as many x's as possible such that their squares cover all the required y's.

---------------

 

Wait, but if we can choose any real numbers, then for each y from 0 to 9, we can include both sqrt(y) and -sqrt(y),

---------------

 except for y=0. So, that would give 1 (for y=0) + 2*9 (for y=1 to 9) = 1 + 18 = 19 points. But wait

---------------

, but the problem states that the range is exactly {0,1,...,9}, so we must not include any x's

---------------

 whose squares would produce numbers outside that range. Because if we include an x whose square is, say, 10, then the range would include 10, which is not allowed. Therefore

---------------

, all x's in the domain must satisfy x² ≤ 9. So the domain is restricted to x in [-3, 3], but

---------------

 only at specific points. 

Wait, but actually, x can be any real number such that x² is between 0 and 9.

---------------

 So x must be between -3 and 3. But to make sure that the range doesn't exceed 9, the

---------------

 maximum |x| can be is 3, since 3²=9. Similarly, the minimum is -3. However

---------------

, if we include x values beyond sqrt(9)=3, but since 3 is the square root of 9, so

---------------

 we can't go beyond that. 

But the problem is, to get the maximum number of points in the domain, while

---------------

 ensuring that every number from 0 to 9 is achieved. So, for each y in 0-9, we can have two

---------------

 x's except for y=0. But we have to check if those x's are unique. For example, if we

---------------

 have x=1 and x=-1, both give y=1. Similarly, x=2 and -2 give y=4, etc

---------------

. 

But in order to have the maximum number of points, we need to include as many x's as possible such that each

---------------

 x's square is in 0-9, and the squares cover all numbers from 0 to 9. 

Wait

---------------

, but actually, if we include all possible x's such that x² is between 0 and 9, then the

---------------

 domain would be the set { -3, -√9, ..., -√1, 0, √1, ..., √9 }, but actually

---------------

, all real numbers between -3 and 3. But since the domain has to be finite, we can pick as many points

---------------

 as we want as long as their squares cover the range. But the problem says the domain is a finite set of points. 



---------------

Wait, but the problem says "finitely many values x", so the domain is a finite set. To maximize the number of points, we can

---------------

 include every possible x such that x² is in 0-9, but also ensuring that all the required y's are covered. Wait

---------------

, but how does that work?

Wait, perhaps the key is that to get each y in the range {0,1,...,9}, we

---------------

 need at least one x such that x² = y, but to maximize the domain, we can include as many x's as possible (

---------------

both positive and negative roots for each y), but without adding any extra y's beyond the range. 

Therefore, for each y from 0 to 9, we

---------------

 can include both sqrt(y) and -sqrt(y), except for y=0. However, if we do this, then

---------------

 the domain would consist of:

For y=0: 1 point (0)

For y=1: 2 points (1 and -1)

For y=2: 2 points (√2 and -√2)

Similarly

---------------

:

y=3: 2 points (√3 and -√3)

y=4: 2 points (2 and -2)

y=5: 2 points (√5 and -√5)

y=6: 2 points (√6 and -√6)

y=7: 2 points (√7 and -√7)

y=8: 2 points (2√2 and -2√2,

---------------

 since sqrt(8) is 2√2)

y=9: 2 points (3 and -3)

So

---------------

, adding these up: 1 + (9 * 2) = 19 points. Wait, but hold on,

---------------

 let me count again:

Wait, for each y from 1 to 9, that's 9 numbers, each contributing 2 x-values,

---------------

 so 18, plus the 1 from y=0, so total 19. 

But the problem states

---------------

 that the range is exactly {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. So

---------------

 if we include all these x-values, then the range will indeed be exactly those numbers because each y from 0 to 9 is achieved by at least one x (the

---------------

 positive sqrt(y)), so that's okay. 

However, but the problem says the domain is a finite set of values. Since

---------------

 each of these x-values (like √2, √3, etc.) are distinct real numbers, so they are

---------------

 all distinct points. Therefore, the total number of points would be 19. 

But wait, is there any overlap? For example, is

---------------

 there any case where two different y's have the same x? For instance, could an x value squared give two different y's? No, each x maps

---------------

 to only one y. So as long as each x is unique, then the total points are 19. 

But

---------------

 hold on, the problem says "the function is given by the formula f(x)=x², but only on a domain she has specified which consists of finitely many values x". So as

---------------

 long as the domain is a finite set of points, and the range is exactly the given set. 

Therefore, if we include

---------------

 all these points, then yes, the range is exactly 0 through 9, and the domain has 19 points. 



---------------

But wait, but maybe the problem expects the domain to consist of integers? Because otherwise, if x can be any real number, then

---------------

 we could have infinitely many points between, say, -3 and 3, but the problem says the domain is finite. Wait

---------------

, but even if they are real numbers, as long as we choose finitely many points, then it's okay. So

---------------

 to maximize the number of points, you can include as many as possible, but each x must be such that x² is in 0-9 and every

---------------

 number from 0-9 is achieved. 

Therefore, the maximum number of points would indeed be 19. But

---------------

 wait, but let me check again:

Wait, for each y from 1 to 9, there are two x's (

---------------

positive and negative roots). For y=0, only one x (0). So that's 1 + 2*9 = 19. 



---------------

But maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check for each y:

y=0: x=0 (1)

y=1: ±

---------------

1 (2)

y=2: ±√2 (2)

y=3: ±√3 (2)

y=4: ±2 (2)

y=5: ±√5 (2)

y=6: ±√6 (2)

y=7: ±√7 (2)

y=8: ±√8 (

---------------

which is ±2√2, but still two distinct numbers) (2)

y=9: ±3 (2)

So

---------------

 that's 1 + (9*2) = 19. 

Therefore, the maximum number of points in the domain is

---------------

 19. 

Wait, but hold on a second. The problem says "the range of f(x) is {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}". So

---------------

 if we include all these x's, then the range is exactly those numbers. 

But is there a way to include even more points without adding

---------------

 more to the range? For example, could we have multiple x's mapping to the same y? But that's already accounted

---------------

 for. Since each y from 1-9 has two x's, so that's already the maximum possible for each y. Since

---------------

 each y can have at most two x's (the positive and negative roots), except y=0. 

Therefore, 

---------------

19 is indeed the maximum. 

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Suppose we

---------------

 can have x values that are not the square roots? For example, suppose we have an x that is not sqrt(y) but

---------------

 still x² is in the range. But if we include such an x, then its square would have to be one of the existing

---------------

 y's, so it would just be another x that maps to that y. But since we already have both roots for each y, there

---------------

's no other x that can map to the same y without overlapping with existing x's. 

Alternatively, maybe fractional x's?

---------------

 Wait, but fractional x's would square to fractions, but the range is integers. So unless the fractional x is sqrt(integer

---------------

), which is exactly what we've considered. 

Therefore, the conclusion is 19. But let me check if the

---------------

 problem might have a different interpretation. 

Wait, maybe the problem expects the domain to consist of integers? Because if so, the answer would be different. Let me see

---------------

. 

If the domain must consist of integers, then the possible x's are integers such that x² is between 0 and 9. The

---------------

 integers x with x² in 0-9 are x from -3 to 3, inclusive. 

So integers from

---------------

 -3 to 3: that's -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. So

---------------

 7 points. But then the range would be 0,1,4,9. Because (-3)^2=9, (-2)^2=4, (-1)^2=1, 0^2=0, etc. So the range would be {0,1,4,9}, which is not

---------------

 the required {0,1,...,9}. 

Therefore, if the domain is restricted to integers, it's impossible to get the range

---------------

 up to 9. So the problem must allow non-integer x's. 

Therefore, going back, the maximum number

---------------

 is indeed 19. Wait, but the problem states "finitely many values x". So 19 is finite, so that works. 

Wait

---------------

, but the problem says "finitely many values x", but the question is, can we have more than 19?

---------------

 Suppose we take x values that are duplicates? But no, because the domain is a set, so duplicates aren't allowed. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe some y's can have more than two x's? But for a given y, there are only two real numbers x such

---------------

 that x² = y (except y=0). So, for each y in 1-9, you can only

---------------

 have two x's. So adding more x's would have to be for different y's, but we have to stay within the range 

---------------

0-9. 

Alternatively, perhaps using x=0 multiple times? But again, the domain is a set, so 0 can only be included once. 

Therefore

---------------

, 19 is indeed the maximum. 

Wait, but let me check once more. Let me count again:

y

---------------

=0: 1

y=1: 2

y=2: 2

y=3: 2

y=4: 2

y=5: 2

y=6: 2

y=7: 2

y=8: 2

y=9: 2

Total: 1 + (9*

---------------

2) = 19. 

Yes, that seems right. 

Therefore, the answer should be 19. 



---------------

Wait, but hold on, let me think again. For example, is sqrt(4) equal to 2 and -2, which

---------------

 are already included. So for y=4, the x's are 2 and -2. Similarly for others. So

---------------

 all those are accounted for. 

Alternatively, is there a case where an x might produce a square that's not in the desired

---------------

 range? For instance, if I include x= sqrt(10), but that would give y=10 which is outside the range

---------------

, so that's not allowed. Therefore, all x's must satisfy x² ≤ 9 and x² ≥0, so x

---------------

 must be between -3 and 3. 

Therefore, all the x's we included are within that interval. 

Therefore

---------------

, 19 is the correct answer. 

But wait, another thought: the problem says "the range of f(x) is {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}". So

---------------

 every number from 0 to 9 must be in the range. So if I include, say, both sqrt(2) and -sqrt(2), that

---------------

 gives y=2. Similarly, sqrt(3) gives y=3, etc. So all the numbers from 0 to 9 are covered. 

Therefore, the

---------------

 maximum possible domain size is 19. 

Hmm, I think that's correct. 

Wait, but let me check

---------------

 if maybe some of these sqrt(y) are the same as others? For instance, sqrt(4) is 2, which is an integer. But sqrt

---------------

(2) is irrational and distinct from sqrt(3), etc. So all those x's are unique. 

Therefore, the

---------------

 total is indeed 19. 

So I think the answer is 19.

**Final Answer**
Answer: 19


To determine the maximum number of points in the domain of Lana's function \( f(x) = x^2 \) given that the range is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}\), we need to consider the possible \( x \)-values that can produce each \( y \)-value in the range.

For each \( y \) in the range:
- \( y = 0 \): The only \( x \) is \( 0 \). This contributes 1 point.
- \( y = 1 \): The \( x \) values are \( 1 \) and \( -1 \). This contributes 2 points.
- \( y = 2 \): The \( x \) values are \( \sqrt{2} \) and \( -\sqrt{2} \). This contributes 2 points.
- \( y = 3 \): The \( x \) values are \( \sqrt{3} \) and \( -\sqrt{3} \). This contributes 2 points.
- \( y = 4 \): The \( x \) values are \( 2 \) and \( -2 \). This contributes 2 points.
- \( y = 5 \): The \( x \) values are \( \sqrt{5} \) and \( -\sqrt{5} \). This contributes 2 points.
- \( y = 6 \): The \( x \) values are \( \sqrt{6} \) and \( -\sqrt{6} \). This contributes 2 points.
- \( y = 7 \): The \( x \) values are \( \sqrt{7} \) and \( -\sqrt{7} \). This contributes 2 points.
- \( y = 8 \): The \( x \) values are \( 2\sqrt{2} \) and \( -2\sqrt{2} \). This contributes 2 points.
- \( y = 9 \): The \( x \) values are \( 3 \) and \( -3 \). This contributes 2 points.

Summing these contributions:
- 1 (for \( y = 0 \)) + 2 (

---------------

for each of \( y = 1 \) to \( y = 9 \)) = \( 1 + 2 \times 9 = 19 \).

Thus, the maximum number of points that could be in the domain is \(\boxed{19}\).
