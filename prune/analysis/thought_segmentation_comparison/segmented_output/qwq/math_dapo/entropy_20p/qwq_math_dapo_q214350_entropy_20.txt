Okay, so I have this problem about a quadrilateral that's both cyclic (inscribed in a circle) and tangential (has an inscribed circle). The sides are 

---------------

70, 90, 130, and 110, given in order. I need to find the absolute difference between the two segments into

---------------

 which the point of tangency of the incircle divides the side of length 130. The answer should be |x - y|. 



---------------

First, let me recall some properties of bicentric quadrilaterals—those that are both cyclic and tangential. Since it's tangential, it must have an incircle tangent to all four sides. For a quadrilateral to be tangential, the sums of the lengths of the two opposite sides must be equal. Wait, is

---------------

 that right? Let me confirm: In a tangential quadrilateral, the sums of the two pairs of opposite sides are equal. So, that

---------------

 would mean that 70 + 130 should equal 90 + 110? Let me check:

---------------

 70 + 130 is 200, and 90 + 110 is 200. Oh, okay

---------------

, so that checks out. So that's a good start; the quadrilateral is indeed tangential.

Now, since it's also cyclic, it

---------------

's bicentric. There are some formulas related to bicentric quadrilaterals, but maybe I don't need to get that

---------------

 complicated. Let me think about the properties of tangential quadrilaterals first.

In a tangential quadrilateral, the lengths of the tangents from each vertex to the points of tangency with the incircle are equal. Let

---------------

 me denote the sides as a, b, c, d in order. Let the tangent lengths from the vertices be p, q, r, s such that:

- The first

---------------

 side (a =70) is between the tangent lengths p and q, so p + q = a =70.



---------------

- The second side (b=90) is between q and r, so q + r = b=90.

- The third side (c=130) is between r and s, so r + s = c=130.

- The fourth side (d=110) is between s and p, so s + p = d=110.

Since it

---------------

's tangential, the sum of the opposite sides are equal, which we already checked: 70 +130=2

---------------

00 and 90+110=200. So that holds.

Now, if we can set

---------------

 up equations for p, q, r, s, perhaps we can solve for them. Let me write down the four equations:

1. p + q =70

2. q + r =90

3. r + s =130

4. s + p =110

We can solve this system of equations for

---------------

 p, q, r, s. Let's see.

From equation 1: p =70 - q.

From

---------------

 equation 2: r =90 - q.

From equation 3: s =130 - r =130 - (90 - q)=130 -90 + q=40 + q.

From equation 4: s + p = (40 + q) + (70 - q) =40 +70 + q - q =110, which matches

---------------

 equation 4. So that's consistent. 

Therefore, the variables can be expressed in terms of q. But since all

---------------

 variables need to be positive, we can find the possible range for q. However, perhaps we can find the exact values.

---------------

 Wait, since all equations are dependent, there might be infinitely many solutions? But in a tangential quadrilateral, these tangent lengths are

---------------

 uniquely determined. Hmm, maybe I need another condition?

Wait, maybe in a tangential quadrilateral, the semiperimeter is involved.

---------------

 The semiperimeter (s) is (a + b + c + d)/2. Wait, but here I used

---------------

 s already for one of the tangent lengths. That's confusing. Let me use another notation. Let me denote the semiperimeter as S =

---------------

 (70 +90 +130 +110)/2 = (400)/2 =200. Wait

---------------

, that's a big S. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the tangent lengths can be expressed in terms of the semiperimeter. Let

---------------

 me recall that in a tangential quadrilateral, each tangent length is equal to (semiperimeter minus the opposite side). Wait, perhaps

---------------

 not exactly, but let me think again.

Actually, in a tangential quadrilateral with sides a,b,c,d, the tangent lengths from

---------------

 each vertex are equal to (S - a), (S - b), etc., but I need to recall the exact formula.

Wait, let

---------------

 me think again. Let me denote the tangent lengths as follows: suppose the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA with lengths a, b, c, d. Let the tangent lengths from A be p, from B be q, from C be r, and from D be s. Then:



---------------

AB = a = p + q,

BC = b = q + r,

CD = c = r + s,

DA = d = s + p.

Adding

---------------

 all equations: a + b + c + d = 2(p + q + r + s). Therefore, the semiperimeter S = (a + b + c + d)/2 = p + q + r + s. 



---------------

So, each tangent length can be found as follows:

p = (a + d - b - c)/2? Wait, maybe

---------------

 not. Let's try solving the equations again.

We have the four equations:

1. p + q = a =70

2. q + r = b =90

3. r + s = c =130

4. s + p = d =110

If

---------------

 we add all four equations: (p + q) + (q + r) + (r + s) + (s + p) = a + b + c + d



---------------

Which simplifies to 2(p + q + r + s) = 400 (since 70+90+130+110=400).

---------------

 Therefore, p + q + r + s = 200, which is the semiperimeter.

Now, we

---------------

 can solve for each variable. Let me use substitution. Let me write equations again:

From equation 1: p =70 - q

From equation 2: r =90 - q

From equation 3: s =130 - r =130 - (90 - q)=40 + q

From equation 4: s + p = (40 + q) + (70 - q) = 110, which checks

---------------

 out. So all variables are expressed in terms of q. But we need another equation to find q. Wait, but since

---------------

 all equations are satisfied for any q? That can't be. Wait, but actually, since the variables are dependent, but

---------------

 they must all be positive. So the values of p, q, r, s must all be positive. 

Therefore, we

---------------

 can set constraints based on positivity:

p =70 - q >0 => q <70

r =90 - q >0 => q <90

s=40 + q >0,

---------------

 which is always true since q is positive (as it's a tangent length)

Also, since s =40 + q,

---------------

 and s + p =110, which is already satisfied.

Additionally, p =70 - q must be positive, so q <70



---------------

Similarly, r =90 - q must be positive, so q <90, so the stricter condition is q <70.

Also, since

---------------

 s =40 + q must be such that s + p =110, which is okay. 

But also

---------------

, the variables must all be positive, so:

From s =40 + q, since s must be positive, q

---------------

 can be as low as needed, but since q is part of q + r =90, and r =90 - q, then

---------------

 r must also be positive, so q <90, which is already covered. 

But how do we find the value of q? Wait

---------------

, perhaps since the quadrilateral is also cyclic, there's another condition we can use?

Ah, right! Since it's cyclic, we can use properties of cyclic quadrilaterals. For a cyclic quadrilateral, the product of the diagonals can be related to the sums of products of opposite sides? Wait

---------------

, maybe Ptolemy's theorem? Ptolemy's theorem states that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the product of the diagonals is equal to the sum of the products of the opposite sides. 



---------------

So, if the sides are a, b, c, d in order, then Ptolemy's theorem gives:

---------------

 AC * BD = ac + bd. Wait, but I don't know the lengths of the diagonals. Hmm, maybe

---------------

 that's not directly helpful here.

Alternatively, maybe there's another formula that relates the sides and the tangent lengths for bicentric quadrilaterals.

---------------

 Let me recall that bicentric quadrilaterals have both an incircle and a circumcircle, so there are relations between the radii and the distances between centers, but I

---------------

 don't know if that helps here.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that in a tangential quadrilateral, the area can be expressed as r * S, where r is the inradius and S is the semiperimeter. Also

---------------

, in a cyclic quadrilateral, the area can be expressed by Brahmagupta's formula: sqrt((S - a)(S - b)(S - c)(S - d)). Since both

---------------

 expressions equal the area, we can set them equal. 

So, Area = r * S = sqrt( (S - a)(S - b)(S - c)(S - d) )

Therefore

---------------

, we can compute S first. The semiperimeter S is (70 +90 +130 +110)/2 = 400/2 =200. 



---------------

Therefore, Brahmagupta's formula gives Area = sqrt( (200 -70)(200 -90)(200 -130)(200 -110) ) = sqrt(130 * 110 *70 *90).

---------------

 Let me compute that:

First, compute each term:

200 -70 =130,

200 -90=110,

200 -130=70,

200 -110=90.

So

---------------

, Area = sqrt(130 * 110 *70 *90). Let me compute this step

---------------

 by step.

First, multiply 130 and 70: 130 *70 = 9100



---------------

Then 110 *90 = 9900

So, Area = sqrt(9100 * 9900). Hmm

---------------

, that's sqrt(9100 * 9900). Let's see if we can factor this better

---------------

.

Alternatively, note that 130 * 110 *70 *90 can be grouped as (130*90)*(110*70).

---------------

 Let me compute those:

130*90 = 11700,

110*70=7700,

Thus

---------------

, the product is 11700 *7700. Hmm, that's still big. Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 factor into primes?

Alternatively, perhaps compute sqrt( (130 * 90)*(110 *70) ) = sqrt( ( (13*10)*(9*10) )*( (11*10)*(7*10) ) )

Wait

---------------

, 130 is 13*10, 90 is 9*10, 110 is 11*10, 70 is 7*10. So altogether

---------------

:

sqrt( (13*10 * 9*10)*(11*10 *7*10) ) = sqrt( (13*9*11*7)*(10^2)*(

---------------

10^2) )

So, sqrt( (13*9*11*7)*(10^4) ) = 10^2 * sqrt(13*9*11*7)



---------------

Compute 13*9 = 117, 11*7=77, so 117*77.

---------------

 Let me compute that:

117 *77: 100*77=7700, 17*77=1309, so total is 7700 +1309=9009.



---------------

Therefore, sqrt(9009) *100. So the area is 100*sqrt(9009). Hmm, that

---------------

 seems complicated. Maybe I made a miscalculation?

Wait, let me check again:

Wait 130*

---------------

110*70*90. Let's pair them as (130*90)*(110*70).

---------------

 

130 *90 = (13*10)*(9*10)=13*9*100=117*100=11,700

110*70 =

---------------

 (11*10)*(7*10)=11*7*100=77*100=7,700

Then

---------------

, 11,700 *7,700. Let me compute that:

11,700 *7,700 = (11.

---------------

7 *10^3)*(7.7 *10^3)=11.7*7.7 *10^6.

---------------

 

Compute 11.7*7.7:

11*7 =77,

11*0.7=7.7,

0.7*7=4.9,

0.7*0.7=0.49,

Wait,

---------------

 actually, maybe better to compute 11.7 *7.7:

11.7 *7 =81.9,

11.7 *0.7=8.19,

Total

---------------

:81.9 +8.19=90.09

Therefore, 11.7 *7.7=90.09, so total

---------------

 is 90.09 *10^6 =90,090,000. So

---------------

 sqrt(90,090,000). 

sqrt(90,090,000)=sqrt(90090

---------------

000)=sqrt(9009 *10000)=sqrt(9009)*100.

So

---------------

 that matches. So Area = sqrt(9009)*100. Hmm, okay. 

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 there's a better way. Let me see if 9009 factors into squares. 9009 divided

---------------

 by 9 is 1001, so 9009 =9*1001. So

---------------

 sqrt(9*1001)=3*sqrt(1001). So the area is 3*sqrt(1001)*100=

---------------

300*sqrt(1001). Hmm, okay. 

But in any case, the area is also

---------------

 equal to r*S, where S is the semiperimeter (200). Therefore, Area = r*200. So

---------------

 setting equal to Brahmagupta's formula:

r*200 = 300*sqrt(1001)

Therefore

---------------

, r = (300/200)*sqrt(1001) = 1.5*sqrt(1001). Hmm

---------------

, but maybe this is not helpful for our problem. 

Wait, but perhaps we can find the inradius, but the

---------------

 problem is asking for the segments x and y on the side of length 130. Let me recall that in a tangential quadrilateral, the lengths from the point of tangency on

---------------

 a side to the vertices are equal to the tangent lengths. 

Specifically, for the side of length 130 (which is side CD, let

---------------

's say), the two tangent lengths would be r and s (from earlier notation). Wait, hold on, in the earlier

---------------

 equations, the side c=130 is between r and s. So the side CD has length r + s =130, so the point of tangency divides CD into segments of length r and s. Therefore

---------------

, if the side is divided into x and y, then x = r and y = s, or vice versa, so |x - y| = |r - s|. 

Therefore

---------------

, the problem reduces to finding |r - s|. 

So, if I can compute r and s, then subtract them and take absolute value. 

Earlier

---------------

, we had expressions for r and s in terms of q:

r =90 - q,

s =40 + q,

So

---------------

, |r - s| = | (90 - q) - (40 + q)| = |90 - q -40 -q| = |50 - 2q|

---------------

.

Therefore, |x - y| = |50 - 2q|. 

So if I can find the value of q, then I can compute this. 

But

---------------

 how do we find q?

Wait, since the quadrilateral is cyclic, perhaps there is a relation between the tangent lengths and the sides in

---------------

 a cyclic quadrilateral. Let me think. 

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that in a bicentric quadrilateral, there is a relation between the inradius, circumradius, and the distances

---------------

 between the centers, but that might be too complex. 

Alternatively, perhaps using Pitot's theorem? Wait, Pitot's theorem is for tangential quadrilaterals and

---------------

 just states that the sum of two opposite sides are equal, which we already used. 

Alternatively, maybe using the formula for the area in two ways.

---------------

 Since we have Area = r*S = 200r, and also Area = sqrt( (S - a)(S - b)(S - c)(S - d) ). 



---------------

Wait, but if I can compute the area another way, maybe through the tangent lengths?

Alternatively, in a tangential quadrilateral, the area can also be expressed as the sum of the products of the sides and the radius divided

---------------

 by 2? Wait, no, the area is r * S where S is semiperimeter. 

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 using the fact that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the product of the two diagonals can be related to the sum of the products of opposite sides (

---------------

Ptolemy's theorem). But since we don't know the diagonals, maybe that's not helpful unless we can express diagonals in terms of tangent lengths.

---------------

 

Alternatively, let me think of coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to the quadrilateral and trying to compute the inradius? Hmm

---------------

, that might be complicated. 

Wait, another thought: in a bicentric quadrilateral, there is a relation between the inradius (r), circumradius (R), and the distance between the centers (d):

---------------

 but the formula is 1/(R - d) + 1/(R + d) = 2/r. Not

---------------

 sure if that helps here. 

Alternatively, maybe using trigonometric identities. Since the quadrilateral is cyclic, its opposite angles sum to 180 degrees. But

---------------

 I don't see how that connects to the tangent lengths. 

Wait, perhaps going back to the tangent lengths. Let me think

---------------

 of the sides in terms of p, q, r, s. Since we have expressions for p, r, s in terms of q, perhaps

---------------

 we can find another equation from the cyclic condition.

Wait, in a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of the squares of the sides is equal to the sum of the squares of the diagonals plus 4 times the square of the radius of the circle? Hmm

---------------

, not sure. 

Alternatively, there is a formula for a cyclic quadrilateral involving the sides and the tangent lengths? Not

---------------

 sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Law of Cosines on the triangles formed by the radii and the sides?

Alternatively, let

---------------

 me think of the sides in terms of the tangent lengths. Let me write down all the tangent lengths in terms of q:

p =70 - q,

q = q,

r =90 - q,

s =40 + q,

and

---------------

 we know p + q + r + s =200, which checks out.

Now, perhaps in a cyclic quadrilateral, there's

---------------

 a relation between the tangent lengths?

Alternatively, maybe consider the fact that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the product of the two opposite sides' tangent segments relate

---------------

 in some way? Not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that in a tangential quadrilateral, the area is r*S,

---------------

 and we have another formula for the area (Brahmagupta's), so maybe equate them to find r, but then

---------------

 how does that help with q?

Alternatively, perhaps in a bicentric quadrilateral, there is a relation between the inradius, the sides, and the tangent lengths.

---------------

 Wait, but I might need to look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that in a tangential quadrilateral, the lengths of

---------------

 the tangent segments can also be related to the angles. Since the quadrilateral is cyclic, the angles are related as well. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe using the formula for the tangent lengths in terms of the angles. Let me recall that in a tangential polygon, the tangent lengths can be expressed as r / tan(theta/2), where theta is the angle at that vertex. 



---------------

Hmm, since it's cyclic, the angles are related. For a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles sum to 180 degrees, so their

---------------

 halves would sum to 90 degrees. 

Let me try to formalize this. Let the angles at the vertices be A, B, C, D.

---------------

 Then A + C = 180°, B + D =180°. 

The tangent lengths can be expressed

---------------

 in terms of the inradius and the angles. For instance, the tangent length from vertex A (which is p) is

---------------

 equal to r / tan(A/2). Similarly, the tangent length from B (q) is r / tan(B/2), and so on. 

Therefore

---------------

:

p = r / tan(A/2),

q = r / tan(B/2),

r = r / tan(C/2),

s = r / tan(D/2).

Wait

---------------

, but that might complicate things because of the angles, but perhaps with the cyclic condition, we can relate the angles.

Since

---------------

 A + C = 180°, so C = 180° - A, so tan(C/2) = tan(90° - A/2) = cot(A/2). Similarly

---------------

, tan(D/2) = tan(90° - B/2) = cot(B/2).

Therefore, substit

---------------

uting into the expressions for r and s:

r (the tangent length from C) = r / tan(C/2) = r / cot(A/2) = r tan(A/2).



---------------

Similarly, s (the tangent length from D) = r / tan(D/2) = r / cot(B/2) = r tan(B/2).

Therefore

---------------

, we have:

p = r / tan(A/2),

q = r / tan(B/2),

r = r tan(A/2),

s = r tan(B/2).

Hmm

---------------

, so that gives relationships between p, q, r, s in terms of tan(A/2) and tan(B/2). Let

---------------

 me see if I can find a relation here.

Let me denote tan(A/2) = t and tan(B/2) = u. Then,



---------------

p = r / t,

q = r / u,

r = r t,

s = r u.

Therefore, we

---------------

 can write:

p = r / t,

q = r / u,

r = r t ⇒ t = r / r =1? Wait, no

---------------

, that can't be. Wait, hold on, maybe miscalculation.

Wait, if r (the tangent length from C) is equal to r tan(A/2), so

---------------

:

r (tangent length) = r (inradius) * tan(A/2). Therefore, if I use different notation

---------------

, perhaps I should denote the inradius as something else, like 'k' to avoid confusion with the tangent length 'r'.

Let me redefine

---------------

:

Let the inradius be 'k'. Then:

The tangent lengths are:

p = k / tan(A/2),

q = k / tan(B/2),

r = k tan(A/2),

s = k tan(B/2).

Therefore

---------------

, with this notation, we can write:

p = k / t,

q = k / u,

r = k t,

s = k u,

where t = tan(A/2),

---------------

 u = tan(B/2).

Now, since the quadrilateral is cyclic, angles A + C = 180°, so tan

---------------

(A/2) = cot(C/2), but maybe that's not helpful here.

Alternatively, since the sides are known

---------------

, perhaps we can relate the tangent lengths to the sides.

We have the sides expressed in terms of p, q, r, s:

a

---------------

 = p + q =70,

b = q + r =90,

c = r + s =130,

d = s + p =110.

Express

---------------

ed in terms of k, t, u:

From p = k/t and r =kt,

So, a = p + q = (k/t) + (k/u) =k

---------------

(1/t +1/u) =70,

b = q + r = (k/u) + kt =k(1/u + t)=90,

c = r + s = kt +k

---------------

 u =k(t + u)=130,

d = s + p =k u + (k/t)=k(u +1/t)=110.

So

---------------

 now we have four equations:

1. k(1/t +1/u) =70,

2. k(1/u + t)=90,

3. k(t + u)=130,

4. k(u +1/t)=110.

Hmm

---------------

, this system of equations might allow us to solve for t and u and k. Let me see.

Let me denote equations 1 to

---------------

 4 as above.

Let me see equations 3 and 4. Let me write equations 3 and 4 again

---------------

:

3. k(t + u)=130,

4. k(u +1/t)=110.

Let

---------------

 me try to express variables in terms of others.

Let me first note that equations 1 and 2 also involve 1/t and 1/u.

---------------

 Maybe we can let variables be x =1/t and y =1/u. Then, t =1/x, u=1/y.

Then

---------------

 equations become:

1. k(x + y)=70,

2. k(y +1/x)=90,

3. k(1/x +1/y)=130,

4. k(1/y +x)=110.

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 substituting variables like this might help.

Let me rewrite all equations with x =1/t and y=1/u:

Equation1: k(x + y) =70,

Equation2: k(y + x) =90? Wait, no.

---------------

 Wait, equation2 was k(1/u + t)=k(y +1/x). Wait, original equation2: k

---------------

(1/u + t)=k( y +1/x ) =90,

Equation3: k(t + u)=k(1/x +1/y)=130,

Wait, no

---------------

:

Wait, original equation3: k(t + u)=k(1/x +1/y)=130,

Equ

---------------

ation4: k(u +1/t)=k(1/y +x)=110.

Hmm, this substitution might

---------------

 not be simplifying it. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps subtract equations or find ratios.

Looking at equations 1 and 4:

Equation1: k(x + y)=70,

Equation4: k(x

---------------

 +1/y)=110? Wait, no, equation4 is k(u +1/t). Wait, perhaps this

---------------

 is getting too convoluted.

Alternatively, let me see equations 1 and 3:

From equation3: k(t + u)=130,

From equation1: k(1/t +1/u)=70.

Let me denote S

---------------

 = t + u,

and P = t*u.

Then, 1/t +1/u = (t + u)/(t u) = S / P.

Therefore

---------------

, equation1 becomes k*(S / P) =70,

equation3 is k*S =130,

Therefore

---------------

, from equation3: k =130/S,

Substitute into equation1: (130/S)*(S / P)=130/P =70,



---------------

Thus, 130/P =70 ⇒ P=130/70=13/7.



---------------

Therefore, P = t*u =13/7.

Similarly, equations2 and 4:

Equation2: k(1/u + t)=90,

Express

---------------

 1/u + t = t +1/u = (t u +1)/u = (P +1)/u,

Wait

---------------

, maybe better to express in terms of variables.

Alternatively, equation2: k*(1/u + t)=k*( t

---------------

 +1/u ) =k*( (t u +1)/u )=k*( (P +1)/u )=90.

Similarly

---------------

, equation4: k*(u +1/t)=k*( u +1/t )=k*( (t u +1)/t )=k*( (P +1)/t )=110.

Therefore

---------------

, equations2 and 4 become:

Equation2: k*(P +1)/u =90,

Equation4: k*(P +1)/t =110,

But

---------------

 from equation3, k =130/S,

Also, since S =t + u,

and P = t u =13/7,

So

---------------

, we can write equations2 and 4 as:

Equation2: (130/S)*( (13/7 +1)/u )=90,

Wait

---------------

, let me compute P +1 =13/7 +1 =20/7,

So equation2 becomes:

---------------

 (130/S)*(20/7)/u =90,

Similarly, equation4: (130/S)*(20/7)/t =110,

Let

---------------

 me write equation2 and 4 again:

Equation2: [130/(S)] * [20/(7u)] =90,

Equation4: [130/(S)] * [20/(7t)] =110,

Let me solve

---------------

 equation2 for 1/u:

[130/(S)] * [20/(7u)] =90 ⇒ (

---------------

130*20)/(7 S u)=90 ⇒ (2600)/(7 S u)=90 ⇒ 2600 =

---------------

 630 S u ⇒ S u =2600/(630)=260/63 �

---------------

�4.12698...

Similarly, equation4:

[130/(S)] * [20/(7t)] =110 ⇒ (130*20)/(7 S t)=110 ⇒ 

---------------

2600/(7 S t)=110 ⇒ 2600 = 770 S t ⇒ S t =2600/770 �

---------------

�3.37666...

Hmm, so we have:

From equation2: S u =2600/630,



---------------

From equation4: S t =2600/770,

But S =t + u,

So,

---------------

 let me write variables:

Let me denote S = t + u,

We have:

S u =2600/630,

S t =2600/770,

So

---------------

, dividing these two equations:

(S u)/(S t)= (2600/630)/(2600/770)= (770/630)=11/9,

Thus

---------------

, (u)/(t)=11/9 ⇒ u = (11/9)t.

So, u is 11/9 times t.

Since

---------------

 S =t + u = t + (11/9)t = (20/9)t,

Therefore, S = (20/9)t,

Then

---------------

, from equation4: S t =2600/770,

Substitute S = (20/9)t,

Thus

---------------

, (20/9)t * t =2600/770,

=> (20/9)t² =2600/770,

Multiply

---------------

 both sides by 9/20,

t²= (2600/770)*(9/20)= (2600*9)/(770*20)=

---------------

 (23400)/(15400)= 234/154= 117/77≈

---------------

1.5195...

Thus, t²=117/77,

Therefore, t= sqrt(117/77)= sqrt(117)/sqrt(77)=

---------------

 (3*sqrt(13))/sqrt(77),

Hmm, okay, but perhaps we can keep it as sqrt(117/77).



---------------

Then, since u = (11/9)t,

So u = (11/9)*sqrt(117/77),

But

---------------

 maybe we can compute t and u numerically? Let's see:

First, compute sqrt(117/77):

117 divided by77 is

---------------

 approximately 1.5195,

sqrt(1.5195)≈1.2327,

Therefore

---------------

, t≈1.2327,

u≈(11/9)*1.2327≈(

---------------

1.2222)*1.2327≈1.509,

Then S = (20/9)t≈ (20/9)*1.2327≈2.739*2≈2

---------------

.739* (Wait 20/9 is approx 2.2222, so 2.2222*1.2327≈2.739.



---------------

Then, from equation3: k*S=130,

Thus, k=130/S≈130/2.739≈47.46,

Hmm

---------------

, but perhaps we need exact expressions. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps proceed algebraically.

We have t = sqrt(117/77),

and

---------------

 u = (11/9)*sqrt(117/77),

Then, since S = t + u = (20/9)t,

and

---------------

 P = t u =13/7,

Let me check:

t u = sqrt(117/77)*(11/9)*sqrt(117/77)= (11/9)*(117/77)= (11*117)/(9*77).



---------------

Compute numerator:11*117=1287,

Denominator:9*77=693,

Thus

---------------

, 1287/693 = divide numerator and denominator by 3:429/231,

---------------

 again divide by 3:143/77, divide by 11:13/7. 



---------------

Yes! That's correct. So t u =13/7, which matches the earlier result. Good.

So,

---------------

 now, let's see if we can find q.

Recall that in terms of the original variables:

q = r / u (

---------------

from earlier substitution with inradius k and variables x and y, but perhaps I need to go back to the previous variables.



---------------

Wait, in the variables with x and y (x=1/t, y=1/u), we had:

q = k / u,

and

---------------

 k =130/S,

and S = t + u,

So, let me express q in terms of t and u.

q

---------------

 = k / u = (130/S)/u =130/(S u).

From earlier, S u =2600/630,



---------------

Therefore, q=130/(2600/630)=130*(630/2600)= (130/2600)*630= (1/20)*630=31.5.



---------------

Wait, that's a number! So q=31.5.

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me verify:



---------------

Yes, since equation2 had:

k*(P +1)/u =90,

But let me see:

Alternatively, S

---------------

 u =2600/630,

Thus, q =130/(S u) * S?

---------------

 Wait, no, let me retrace.

Wait, q = k / u,

and k =130/S,

so

---------------

 q = (130/S)/u =130/(S u),

and since S u =2600/630,

then

---------------

 q=130/(2600/630)= (130 *630)/2600,



---------------

Simplify:

130 divides into 2600:2600/130=20,

So

---------------

, (130*630)/2600=630/20=31.5,



---------------

Yes, so q=31.5.

Therefore, q=31.5. 

Therefore, since q is found

---------------

, we can compute |x - y|=|50 -2q|=|50 - 2*31.5|=|50 -63|=|-13|=13.

Therefore

---------------

, the answer is 13. 

Wait, let me confirm once again. Let me recap:

We had |x - y|=|50 - 2q|,

We

---------------

 found q=31.5,

Thus, 50 - 2*(31.5)=50-63=-13, absolute value 13.

Therefore

---------------

, the answer is 13. 

Let me check if this makes sense. 

So, with q=31.5,

Then

---------------

 p=70 - q=70 -31.5=38.5,

r=90 - q=90 -31.5=58.5,

s=40 + q=40 +31.5=71.5,

Check

---------------

 that r + s=58.5 +71.5=130, which is correct,

and s +p=71.5 +38.5=110, which matches the

---------------

 fourth side.

Also, the tangent lengths p=38.5, q=31.5, r=58.5, s=71.5,



---------------

Sum p+q+r+s=38.5+31.5+58.5+71.5= (

---------------

38.5+31.5)+(58.5+71.5)=70+130=200, which is correct.



---------------

Therefore, the computations check out.

Therefore, the segments x and y on the side of length 130 (which is divided

---------------

 into r and s) are 58.5 and 71.5, so their difference is 71.5 -58.5=13, so the

---------------

 absolute value is 13.

Therefore, the answer should be 13.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{13}


Given a bicentric quadrilateral with sides 70, 90, 130, and 110, we need to find the absolute difference between the segments into which the point of tangency of the incircle divides the side of length 130.

First, we note

---------------

 that the quadrilateral is tangential, so the sums of the lengths of opposite sides are equal:
\[
70 + 130 = 90 + 110 = 200
\]
We denote the tangent lengths from the vertices as \( p, q, r, s \) such that:
\[
\begin{aligned}
p + q &= 70, \\
q + r &= 90, \\
r + s &= 130, \\
s + p &= 110.
\end{aligned}
\]

Solving these equations, we express \( p, r, s \) in terms of \( q \):
\[
\begin{aligned}
p &= 70 - q, \\
r &= 90 - q, \\
s &= 130 - r = 130 - (90 - q) = 40 + q.
\end{aligned}
\]

We substitute

---------------

 \( s = 40 + q \) into the fourth equation:
\[
s + p = (40 + q) + (70 - q) = 110
\]
which is consistent. 

Next, we use the fact that the quadrilateral is cyclic. We

---------------

 solve for \( q \) by considering the system of equations derived from the relationships between the tangent lengths and the inradius. After

---------------

 solving the system, we find:
\[
q = 31.5
\]

Using this value of \( q \), we compute the tangent lengths \( r \) and \( s \):
\[
\begin{aligned}
r &= 90 - 31.5 = 58.5, \\
s &= 40 + 31.5 = 71.5.
\end{aligned}
\]

The segments \( x \) and \( y \) on the side of length 130 are \( r \) and \( s \). The absolute difference is:
\[
|x - y| = |58.5 - 71.5| = |

---------------

 -13 | = 13
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{13}
