Okay, so I need to figure out how many values of x satisfy the equation f(f(x)) = 3. The problem gives

---------------

 me the graph of the function f(x), but since I can't see the actual image, I have to rely on the Asymptote code provided to visualize it. Let me parse

---------------

 the Asymptote code step by step to understand the graph's structure.

First, the Asymptote code starts

---------------

 by importing the graph package and setting some parameters for the size and style of the plot. Then, it draws the grid lines for

---------------

 x from -4 to 5 and y from 1 to 6, with dashed grey lines. The x and y axes are labeled, and there are arrows at the ends. 

The main

---------------

 part is the drawing of the function f(x). Let's look at the lines that define the graph:

1. The first segment is drawn from (xmin, (-(

---------------

0) - (-2)*xmin)/-2) to (-1, (-(0) - (-2)*-1)/-2) with a linewidth of 1.2. Let me simplify

---------------

 that equation. The formula for the line seems to be y = [ -0 - (-2)x ] / -2. Wait, that

---------------

 might be a bit confusing. Let me re-express that.

The general formula for a line can be written as y = mx + b. Let

---------------

 me see if I can parse the Asymptote code's line equation. The first segment is from xmin (which is -4.4) to x = -1. The equation

---------------

 given is (-(0) - (-2)*x)/-2. Let me compute that step by step:

The expression inside

---------------

 the y-coordinate is ( - (0) - (-2)*x ) divided by -2. Simplifying numerator: -0 is 0, so

---------------

 it's 0 + 2x. Then divided by -2 gives (2x)/(-2) = -x. So

---------------

 the equation for this first segment is y = -x. But this is drawn from x = -4.4 up to x = -1. Wait

---------------

, but the starting point is when x is xmin, which is -4.4, but the line is drawn until x = -1. So

---------------

 the first part of the function from x = -4.4 to x = -1 is the line y = -x.

But

---------------

 let me confirm. The code says:

draw((i,-1)--(i,6), dashed+mediumgrey); for

---------------

 the vertical grid lines, but that's just the grid. The function is drawn with three segments:

First segment: from (xmin, [

---------------

equation]) to (-1, ...). The equation for the first segment's y-coordinate is (-(0) - (-2)*x)/-2. Wait

---------------

, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me look again. The code says:

draw((xmin, (-(0) - (-2)*xmin)/-2) -- (-1, (-(0) - (-2)*-1)/-2), linewidth(1.2));

Wait

---------------

, so the y-coordinate at any x in the first segment is calculated as [ -0 - (-2)*x ] divided by -2. Wait

---------------

, that would be (0 + 2x)/-2 = (2x)/-2 = -x. So yes

---------------

, the first part is the line y = -x from x = -4.4 to x = -1.

Second

---------------

 segment: draw((-1,1)--(3,5),linewidth(1.2)). So from the point (-1, 1) to (3, 5). Let's see the

---------------

 slope here: from x=-1 to x=3 is 4 units in x, and from y=1 to y=5 is 4 units in y, so slope is 1. So that

---------------

's a line with slope 1, so equation y = x + b. Plugging in x=-1, y=1: 1 = -1 + b =>

---------------

 b=2. So equation here is y = x + 2 from x=-1 to x=3.

Third segment: draw((3, [equ

---------------

ation]) -- (xmax, [equation]), linewidth(1.2)). The equation here is written as ( -(-16) - (2)*x ) / 2. Let me parse this.

---------------

 The y-coordinate at x is [ -(-16) - 2x ] divided by 2. That simplifies to (16 - 2x)/2 = 8 - x. Wait, let

---------------

 me check again:

The code says for the third segment: 

draw((3, ( -(-16) - (2)*3 ) / 2 ) -- (xmax, ( -(-16) - (2)*xmax ) / 2 ), linewidth(1.2));

So

---------------

 the y-coordinate is [16 - 2x]/2 = 8 - x. Wait, 16 divided

---------------

 by 2 is 8, and -2x/2 is -x, so yes, that's 8 - x. So

---------------

 the third segment is the line y = 8 - x from x=3 to x=5.66 (since xmax is 5.66). 

Additionally, there are some dots mentioned

---------------

: 

dot((-1,1),ds); dot((3,5),ds); dot((-3,3),ds); dot((1,3),ds); dot((5,3),ds);

These

---------------

 are points that are emphasized on the graph. The points (-1,1), (3,5), (-3,3), (1,3), and (5,3) are plotted

---------------

 as dots. Also, there are two other dots at (-4.32,4.32) and (5.56,2.44), but those

---------------

 might just be endpoints beyond the main graph segments? Wait, but the first segment starts at x=-4.4, so maybe

---------------

 those are just endpoints? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, the first segment is from xmin (-4.4) to (-

---------------

1, ...). The starting point's y-coordinate is -x, so at x=-4.4, that would be y=4.4. But

---------------

 the code also has a dot at (-4.32, 4.32), which is very close to (-4.4, 4.4).

---------------

 Maybe that's just an endpoint. Similarly, the third segment ends at xmax (5.66), so x=5.66, y=8 - 5.66 = 2.34, but

---------------

 the dot is at (5.56, 2.44). Close, perhaps due to rounding. So maybe

---------------

 those dots are just endpoints.

But the other dots: (-3,3), (1,3), (5,3) –

---------------

 these are points on the graph? Wait, let's see. Let me check if those points lie on the lines.

First

---------------

, (-3,3): Let's see which segment that's in. The first segment is from x=-4.4 to x=-1. So

---------------

 x=-3 is in that interval. The line here is y = -x. So at x=-3, y should

---------------

 be -(-3)=3. So yes, that point is on the first segment. So (-3,3) is on

---------------

 the graph.

Similarly, (1,3): x=1 is between -1 and 3, so in the second segment (

---------------

y = x + 2). Plugging x=1: y=1 + 2=3. Correct, so (1,3) is on the graph.

(5,3): x=5 is in the third segment (x

---------------

 from 3 to 5.66). The third segment's equation is y=8 - x. So at x=5, y=8 -5 = 3. So yes, (5,3) is on the third segment.

Therefore

---------------

, those three points (-3,3), (1,3), (5,3) are points on the graph where the

---------------

 function f(x) equals 3. So f(-3)=3, f(1)=3, f(5)=3. The

---------------

 other dots at (-1,1) and (3,5) are the points where the segments connect. 

So putting

---------------

 this all together, the graph of f(x) is a piecewise linear function with three segments:

1. From x = -4.4 to x = -1: f(x) = -x. This

---------------

 is a line going from (-4.4, 4.4) down to (-1,1). 

2. From x = -1 to x = 3: f(x) = x + 2. This line

---------------

 goes from (-1,1) up to (3,5).

3. From x = 3 to x = 5.66: f(x) = 8 - x. This line goes from (3,5) down to (5.66, ~

---------------

2.34).

Additionally, there are points at (-3,3), (1,3), and (5,3) where f(x)=3. 

Now, the problem is asking for the number of x-values that satisfy f(f(x)) = 3. 

To solve this, I need to find all x such that when you apply f twice, you get 3. That

---------------

 is, first find all x where f(x) = y, and then y must satisfy f(y) = 3. So first

---------------

, find all y where f(y) = 3, then for each such y, find all x where f(x) = y. The total number of such x's

---------------

 will be the answer.

So first step: find all y such that f(y) = 3. From the graph, we

---------------

 can see that f(y)=3 occurs at three points: y = -3, 1, and 5. Because f

---------------

(-3)=3, f(1)=3, and f(5)=3 as noted earlier.

Therefore, to have f(f(x)) = 3, we need f(x) to be one of these y-values: -3, 1, or 5. So

---------------

 next, we need to find all x such that f(x) = -3, f(x)=1, or f(x)=5. Then, the total number of such

---------------

 x's is the answer.

Therefore, we need to solve three equations:

1. f(x) = -3

2. f(x) = 1

3. f(x) = 5

For

---------------

 each of these, find the number of solutions x, then add them up.

Let me tackle each case one by one.

First, f

---------------

(x) = -3.

Looking at the graph of f(x):

The function f(x) is made up of three linear segments. Let's check

---------------

 each segment to see if f(x) = -3 is possible.

First segment: f(x) = -x for x between

---------------

 -4.4 and -1.

Set -x = -3 → x = 3. But x=3 is not in the interval [-4.4, -1]. So no solution here.

Second segment: f(x) = x + 2 for x between -1 and 3.

Set x + 2 = -3 → x = -5. But x=-5 is not in [-1, 3]. No solution here.

Third segment: f(x) = 8 - x for x between 3 and 5.66.

Set 8 - x = -3 → x = 11. But

---------------

 x=11 is outside the interval [3,5.66]. So no solution here.

Therefore, f(x) = -3 has no solutions. So that

---------------

 case contributes 0.

Second equation: f(x) = 1.

Again, check each segment:

First segment: f(x) = -x.

---------------

 Solve -x = 1 → x = -1. Check if x is in [-4.4, -1]. x

---------------

=-1 is the endpoint. So that's a solution.

Second segment: f(x) = x + 2. Solve x + 2 = 1 → x = -1. But x=-1 is the left endpoint of this segment. However

---------------

, in the second segment, the domain starts at x=-1. So x=-1 is included here as well. Wait, but in

---------------

 the first segment, the endpoint is at x=-1, so perhaps there's a point at (-1,1). The

---------------

 problem's Asymptote code has a dot at (-1,1), so that point is included in both segments? Wait

---------------

, actually, in the Asymptote code, the first segment is drawn up to (-1,1), and the second segment starts at (-1,1). So the

---------------

 point (-1,1) is included in both, but since it's a single point, it's part of both segments. So

---------------

 x=-1 is a valid solution here as well. Wait, but when solving f(x)=1, x=-1 is a

---------------

 solution from both segments? Hmm, but since the function is continuous there, it's just one point. So the equation f(x)=1 has

---------------

 x=-1 as a solution.

Third segment: f(x)=8 -x. Solve 8 -x =1 → x=7. But

---------------

 7 is outside the domain [3,5.66]. So no solution here.

Therefore, f(x)=1 has exactly one solution at x=-1.

Third equation: f(x) =5.

Check

---------------

 each segment:

First segment: f(x) = -x. Set -x =5 → x = -5. Not

---------------

 in [-4.4, -1]. So no.

Second segment: f(x)=x+2. Solve x+2=5 → x=3. Check

---------------

 if x=3 is in [-1,3]. x=3 is the right endpoint. The second segment goes up to x=3, so x=3 is included here, and there

---------------

's a dot at (3,5). So x=3 is a solution here.

Third segment: f(x)=8 -x. Set 8 -x =5 → x=3. But x

---------------

=3 is the left endpoint of the third segment. Since the third segment starts at x=3, the point (3,5) is part

---------------

 of both the second and third segments. So x=3 is included here as well. But again, since it's a

---------------

 single point, the equation f(x)=5 has x=3 as the solution. 

Therefore, f(x)=5 has exactly one solution at x=3.

Therefore

---------------

, putting it all together:

Number of solutions for f(x) = -3: 0

Number of solutions for f(x) =1: 1 (x=-1)

Number of solutions for f(x)=5:1 (x=3)

Therefore

---------------

, total solutions for f(f(x))=3 is 0 +1 +1 =2?

Wait, hold on,

---------------

 that seems low. Wait, maybe I missed something here. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I need to check for

---------------

 all possible x such that f(x) equals to each of the y-values (which are -3,1,5). But

---------------

 when solving f(x)=1, we found x=-1, and f(x)=5 gives x=3, but perhaps

---------------

 there are more solutions?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in solving f(x)=1 and f(x)=5. Let me re

---------------

-examine each equation.

Starting with f(x)=1:

First segment: f(x) = -x. Setting that equal to 1 gives x = -1. Since

---------------

 the first segment is from x=-4.4 to x=-1, so x=-1 is the endpoint. So that is valid

---------------

.

Second segment: f(x)=x+2. Setting to 1 gives x = -1. But the second segment starts

---------------

 at x=-1. So x=-1 is part of the second segment as well. However, since x=-1 is the

---------------

 boundary point between the first and second segments, but the function is continuous there. So in terms of solutions, x=-1 is counted

---------------

 once here. 

Third segment: f(x)=8 -x. Setting to 1 gives x=7, which is outside the

---------------

 domain. So total for f(x)=1 is only x=-1. So that's 1 solution.

For f(x)=5:

First segment: f(x) = -x =5 →

---------------

 x=-5, which is too low.

Second segment: f(x)=x+2=5 → x=3. The

---------------

 second segment goes up to x=3, so that's valid.

Third segment: f(x)=8 -x =5 → x=3. The

---------------

 third segment starts at x=3, so x=3 is part of the third segment as well, but again, it

---------------

's the same point. So x=3 is the only solution here, counted once. 

Therefore, that gives 1 solution

---------------

 for f(x)=5.

Wait, but maybe there are more points where f(x)=1 or f(x)=5?

---------------

 Let me check the graph's shape again.

Looking at the first segment, from x=-4.4 to x=-1:

---------------

 f(x) = -x. So as x goes from -4.4 to -1, the function goes from 4.4 down to 1. So at

---------------

 x=-1, it's 1, and before that, it's higher. So only x=-1 gives f(x)=1 here

---------------

.

Second segment from x=-1 to x=3: f(x)=x+2. This goes from 1 up

---------------

 to 5. So at x=3, it's 5. Along the way, it's increasing from 1 to 5, so every

---------------

 value between 1 and 5 is achieved here. Wait, so if we set f(x)=1, the only solution

---------------

 here is x=-1, which is the starting point. Similarly, for f(x)=5, only x=3 here

---------------

. 

Third segment from x=3 to x=5.66: f(x)=8 -x. This starts

---------------

 at 5 and decreases to 8 -5.66 ≈ 2.34. So in this segment, f(x) goes

---------------

 from 5 down to about 2.34. Therefore, f(x)=5 is achieved only at x=3,

---------------

 and f(x)=1 isn't achieved here because it only goes down to ~2.34, which is above 1. 

Wait

---------------

 a second, but f(x)=1 isn't achieved in the third segment because the third segment's minimum y-value is about

---------------

 2.34. So no, only x=-1 is the solution for f(x)=1. Similarly, f

---------------

(x)=5 is only at x=3. 

Hmm, so that gives 2 solutions total? But the problem is

---------------

 asking for how many x satisfy f(f(x))=3. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here because when I

---------------

 considered the equations f(x)= -3, 1, or 5, but maybe there are other points where f(x) can

---------------

 be those values?

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the function f(x) could take the values 1 or 5 at

---------------

 other points?

Wait, let's think again. The function f(x) is piecewise linear, so maybe in the second segment,

---------------

 from x=-1 to 3, the function f(x)=x+2 goes from 1 to 5. So every

---------------

 value between 1 and 5 is achieved here. Therefore, if I set f(x)=1, that occurs only at x=-1.

---------------

 Similarly, f(x)=5 only at x=3. But if I set f(x)= some value between 1 and 5, there

---------------

 are multiple x's, but here we need f(x)= exactly 1 or exactly 5. So only one x each. 

Wait

---------------

, but maybe I missed something in the first segment?

Wait, in the first segment, f(x) = -x from

---------------

 x=-4.4 to x=-1. So the range here is from 4.4 down to 1. So f

---------------

(x) here can take any value between 1 and 4.4. So if I set f(x)=3,

---------------

 which is between 1 and 4.4, then that equation would have a solution here. Wait, but in our

---------------

 problem, we are looking for f(x) equal to -3,1, or 5, so 3 isn't in

---------------

 those. Wait, but in the problem, the first step was to find all y where f(y)=3, which are

---------------

 y=-3,1,5. Then, for each of those y's, find the x's such that f(x)=y. So

---------------

 for y=3, which is one of the original f(y)=3, but wait, no. Wait, actually, the

---------------

 process is:

We need f(f(x)) = 3. Let me rephrase:

Let me denote y = f(x). Then f

---------------

(f(x)) = f(y) = 3. Therefore, first find all y such that f(y)=3. Those

---------------

 y's are the solutions to f(y)=3, which are y = -3, 1, 5 as established

---------------

. Then, for each of these y's, find all x such that f(x)=y. The total number of x's is the sum

---------------

 over each y of the number of x's that map to y via f(x).

So, for each y in {-3,1,5}, find

---------------

 the number of x with f(x)=y, then add them up.

Earlier, I found that:

For y = -3: f

---------------

(x) = -3 has 0 solutions.

For y =1: f(x)=1 has 1 solution (x=-1)

For y=5: f(x)=5 has 1 solution (x=3)

Total

---------------

: 0 +1 +1 =2.

But wait, but that would mean only two solutions. However, maybe I made

---------------

 an error here because in the first segment, f(x) can take the value 3. Wait, but in this case, we

---------------

 are looking for x such that f(x) is equal to -3, 1, or 5. So the 

---------------

3 is only on the first level (the y's that lead to f(y)=3). So 3 is not a

---------------

 target here for f(x). 

Wait, but perhaps there's another way. Wait, let me re-express this step

---------------

 by step again.

First step: Find all y such that f(y) = 3. From the graph, this happens

---------------

 at three points: y = -3, 1, and 5. So these are the three y-values that when

---------------

 plugged into f give 3. 

Second step: For each of these y-values, find the number of x such that f(x) = y. 



---------------

So for y = -3: How many x with f(x) = -3? 

Looking at f(x):

First

---------------

 segment: f(x) = -x. So solving -x = -3 → x = 3. But x=3 is in the second

---------------

 segment's domain (from -1 to 3). Wait, hold on. Wait, the first segment is up to x=-1, so x=3 is in

---------------

 the second or third segment. Wait, the second segment is up to x=3. So at x=3, f

---------------

(x)=5. So solving for f(x) = -3 in first segment: x would need to be 3, but that's not

---------------

 in the first segment. The first segment is only up to x=-1. So no solution here. 

Second segment: f(x) =x +2. Setting

---------------

 x+2 = -3 → x = -5. Not in the domain [-1,3]. 

Third segment: f(x)=8 -x. 

---------------

8 -x = -3 → x=11. Not in [3, 5.66]. 

Thus

---------------

, no solutions for f(x)=-3.

For y=1: f(x)=1. As before, only x=-1.



---------------

For y=5: f(x)=5. Only x=3.

Hence, total solutions are 0+1+1=2.

But that

---------------

 seems low. Let me check again. Wait, perhaps I'm missing solutions where f(x)=1 or f(x)=5 have

---------------

 more solutions?

Wait, let's think again about f(x)=1. The equation f(x)=1 is solved at x=-1,

---------------

 but is there another point? For instance, in the third segment, does f(x) ever equal 1?

The third segment is

---------------

 f(x) =8 -x. So solving 8 -x =1 → x=7, which is outside the domain.

---------------

 So no. 

Wait, but the first segment's maximum value is 4.4 (at x=-4.4),

---------------

 going down to 1. So f(x)=1 only at x=-1. 

Similarly for f(x)=5,

---------------

 the second segment reaches 5 at x=3, and the third segment starts at 5 and goes down, so no

---------------

 other x gives f(x)=5. 

Hmm, so that gives two solutions. But the problem is from an Olympiad, maybe

---------------

 the answer is different. Maybe I missed something?

Wait, let me check the Asymptote code again for any other

---------------

 points or segments. The code also has:

// draw((min,(-(-9)-(0)*xmin)/3)--(xmax,(-(-9)-(0)*xmax)/3),linetype("6pt 6pt"));

This line is commented out, so it's not part of the graph. So

---------------

 probably not relevant.

Additionally, the dots at (-3,3), (1,3), (5,3) are on

---------------

 the graph. So f(-3)=3, f(1)=3, f(5)=3. So those are the three y-values that

---------------

 give f(y)=3. 

Wait, but let me think differently. Maybe I made a mistake in the first step.

---------------

 Let me confirm again the values where f(y)=3. The dots at (-3,3), (1,3), (5,3) are

---------------

 on the graph. Therefore, those three points are the only points where f(y)=3. So y=-3,1

---------------

,5. Correct. 

Therefore, the process is correct. Then, the equations f(x)= -3,1,5 have

---------------

 solutions counts 0,1,1, totaling 2. But maybe I need to check if there are other points where f(x) equals

---------------

 1 or 5? Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the second segment (from x=-1 to 3) is

---------------

 f(x)=x+2. So for this segment, when x is between -1 and 3, f(x) goes

---------------

 from 1 to 5. So f(x)=1 is only at x=-1, and f(x)=5 is only at x=3, which

---------------

 are the endpoints. So that's correct. 

Third segment (x from 3 to 5.66): f(x)=8 -x. So

---------------

 starting at (3,5) and decreasing. So f(x)=5 is only at x=3. 

First segment (x from -4.4 to -1): f(x)=-

---------------

x, so from 4.4 down to 1. So f(x)=1 is only at x=-1. 

Therefore

---------------

, the count is indeed 2. But that seems too low. Wait, perhaps I need to check if the function f

---------------

(x) can take the value 1 or 5 at other points?

Wait, let me consider if there are any other

---------------

 intersections. Let me think of the graph:

First segment (left part): from (-4.4, 4.4) down to (-1,1). So

---------------

 slope -1.

Second segment (middle): from (-1,1) up to (3,5). Slope +1.

Third segment (right): from (3,5) down to (5.66, ~2.34). Slope -1.

Therefore

---------------

, the graph is a zig-zag. 

So the function f(x) is decreasing on the first and third segments, increasing on the second. 

Now

---------------

, when solving f(x)=1, the only solution is x=-1 because in the first segment, it reaches 1 at x=-1, and in

---------------

 the second segment, it starts at 1 and goes up. So the only point where f(x)=1 is x=-1. 

Similarly, for f(x)=5, only

---------------

 at x=3. 

Therefore, the total number of x's is 2. 

But the problem says "how many values of x satisfy f(f(x)) =3".

---------------

 If the answer is 2, but maybe I made an error in the first step? Wait, let me see the As

---------------

ymptote code again. It mentions:

label("$f(x)$",(-3.52,4.6),SE*lsf);

And

---------------

 the dots: 

dot((-1,1),ds); dot((3,5),ds); dot((-3,3),ds); dot((1,3),ds); dot((5,3),ds);

So

---------------

 the dots at (-3,3), (1,3), (5,3) are on the graph, so those

---------------

 are three points where f(x)=3. Thus, f(y)=3 when y is -3,1,5. 



---------------

Wait, but maybe there are other points where f(y)=3? Let me check:

Looking at the first segment: f(x)=-x. So

---------------

 solving f(x)=3 gives -x=3 → x=-3. Which is exactly the point (-3,3).

---------------

 So that's included.

Second segment: f(x)=x+2. Setting x+2=3 gives x=1. Which

---------------

 is the point (1,3). 

Third segment: f(x)=8 -x. Setting 8 -x =3 → x=5, which is (5,3). 

Therefore

---------------

, those three points are the only ones where f(y)=3. So that's correct. 

Therefore, the only possible

---------------

 y's are -3,1,5, leading to x solutions 0,1,1. 

Hmm. Maybe

---------------

 I need to check if the function f(x) can take the value 1 or 5 at other x's outside the obvious

---------------

 points? Let me see:

For f(x)=1:

First segment: f(x)=-x=1 → x=-1 (

---------------

which is the endpoint between first and second segments).

Second segment: f(x)=x+2=1 → x=-1 (

---------------

the start of the second segment).

Third segment: f(x)=8 -x=1 → x=7 (outside domain

---------------

).

So only x=-1.

For f(x)=5:

Second segment: x+2=5 →x=3 (end of second segment).



---------------

Third segment: 8 -x=5 →x=3 (start of third segment).

So only x=3.

Therefore

---------------

, yes, only two solutions. 

Wait, but the problem is from an Olympiad, and the answer seems too small

---------------

. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the Asymptote code?

Let me re-examine the Asymptote code for

---------------

 the first segment:

The first segment is drawn from (xmin, [equation]) to (-1, ...). The equation given

---------------

 for the first segment is (-(0) - (-2)*x)/-2, which we determined simplifies to -x. 



---------------

Wait, let me check that again. The code says:

draw((xmin, (-(0) - (-2)*xmin)/-2)

---------------

 -- (-1, (-(0) - (-2)*-1)/-2), linewidth(1.2));

Breaking

---------------

 down the y-coordinate for the first point (xmin, ...):

The y-coordinate is computed as ( -0 - (-2)*xmin ) divided by -2.

So

---------------

 that's (0 + 2*xmin)/-2 = (2*xmin)/-2 = -xmin. So

---------------

 the y-coordinate is -xmin. 

Wait a second! Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me rec

---------------

alculate.

The formula is: 

For the first segment's y-coordinate, the code says:

(-(0) - (-2)*x)/-2



---------------

Wait, that's numerator: -0 - (-2)x = 0 + 2x, then divided by -2:

---------------

 (2x)/(-2) = -x. So that is correct. So the first segment is indeed y = -x.

---------------

 

But then, when x is xmin, which is -4.4, then y would be -(-4.4)=4.4. So

---------------

 the starting point is (-4.4,4.4), which is consistent with the dot at (-4.32,4.32)

---------------

 (probably rounded). 

Therefore, my previous analysis holds. 

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the function might be defined at

---------------

 points beyond the drawn segments? But the problem says "the graph of the function f(x) is shown below", so we

---------------

 can assume the graph is exactly as drawn, with the three segments. 

Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the number of solutions for

---------------

 f(x)=1 or f(x)=5?

Wait, let me think of the entire graph again. 

Suppose someone

---------------

 draws the graph:

- From the left, starting at (-4.4,4.4), going down to (-1,1).



---------------

- Then up to (3,5).

- Then down again to (5.66, ~2.34).

The

---------------

 three key points where f(x)=3 are at x=-3 (on first segment), x=1 (on second), and x=5 (on third). 

So

---------------

 f(f(x))=3 requires that f(x) must be one of those three x-values (-3,1,5). 



---------------

Thus, to find x such that f(x) is -3,1, or5. 

For f(x)=-3: no

---------------

 solutions.

For f(x)=1: x=-1.

For f(x)=5: x=3.

So total x

---------------

's are -1 and 3, so two solutions. 

Wait, but the problem says "how many values of x satisfy

---------------

...", so the answer is 2? 

Alternatively, maybe there are more solutions because when solving f(x)=1 or f(x)=5, there

---------------

 are more x's?

Wait, let me consider the entire graph again for f(x)=1 and f(x)=5:



---------------

For f(x)=1:

The function reaches 1 only at x=-1. Since the first segment is decreasing from 4.4 to 1, and

---------------

 the second segment starts at 1 and goes up. So yes, only x=-1.

For f(x)=5:

The function reaches 5 only at x=3. The second segment ends

---------------

 at 5, and the third segment starts there and goes down. So only x=3. 

Hence, only

---------------

 two x's. 

Wait, but maybe the function has other intersections? For instance, in the third segment, when x

---------------

=5, f(x)=3. So if we consider f(f(5)) = f(3) =5. But

---------------

 that would be f(f(5))=5, which is not 3, so that's irrelevant. 

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 I need to check if f(x)= y where y is such that f(y)=3, but considering multiplicities? Wait

---------------

, no. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is defined at the endpoints correctly. For example, at x=-1, the

---------------

 first segment ends and the second starts. So f(-1)=1 is part of both segments, but it's a single point, so no

---------------

 extra solutions there. 

Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the number of solutions for f(x)=1 or f(x)=5?



---------------

Wait, let's take a different approach. Let me tabulate the possible ranges and see for each y in {-3,1,5}, how many x satisfy

---------------

 f(x)=y.

Starting with y=-3:

Looking at f(x)= -3.

Looking at each segment:

1. First segment (x from -4.4 to -1): f(x) = -x. Set

---------------

 to -3:

-x = -3 → x=3. But 3 is not in [-4.4, -1]. So no solution.

2. Second segment (x from -1 to 3): f(x)=x +2. Set to -3:

x +2 = -3 → x =

---------------

 -5. Not in [-1,3]. No.

3. Third segment (x from 3 to 5.66): f(x)=8 -x. Set to -3:

8 -x =-3 → x=11. Not in domain

---------------

. No. So total 0.

y=1:

1. First segment: -x =1 → x=-1.

---------------

 In domain. So 1 solution.

2. Second segment: x+2=1 → x=-1. In domain (since x

---------------

=-1 is the start). So same point. So total 1 solution.

3. Third segment:8 -x=1 →x=7. No. 

Total 

---------------

1 solution.

y=5:

1. First segment: -x=5 →x=-5. No.

2. Second segment: x+2=5 →x=3. In domain (up

---------------

 to 3). So yes.

3. Third segment:8 -x=5 →x=3. In domain (starting

---------------

 at 3). Same point. So total 1 solution.

Total solutions:0+1+1=2.

Hmm

---------------

. So that's consistent. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem counts the point x=3 as two solutions because it's the

---------------

 endpoint of two segments? But no, even though it's part of two segments, the function's value there is uniquely 5, so f

---------------

(3)=5 is only one x=3. 

Same with x=-1: it's part of both segments, but f(-1)=1 is only

---------------

 one x=-1.

Therefore, total two solutions. 

Wait, but maybe the Asymptote code has another part

---------------

 I didn't consider. The commented-out line:

// draw((min,(-(-9)-(0)*xmin)/3)--(xmax,(-(-9)-(0)*xmax)/3),linetype("6pt 6pt"));

This line

---------------

 is commented out, so it's not part of the graph. So I can ignore it.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the

---------------

 slope for the third segment? Let me check:

The third segment is drawn from (3, [equation]) to (xmax, [equation]). The equation given

---------------

 is ( -(-16) -2*x ) / 2. 

Wait, let me parse that again. The y-coordinate at

---------------

 any x in the third segment is:

[ -(-16) - (2)*x ] / 2. 



---------------

Wait, -(-16) is 16, so (16 - 2x)/2 = 8 -x. Yes

---------------

, that's correct. So the third segment is y=8 -x. So that's correct. 

Hmm, so

---------------

 unless there's an error in my reasoning, the answer should be 2. But I feel like maybe I'm missing something because

---------------

 often these problems have more solutions. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the first segment goes from x=-4.4 to x=-1, so

---------------

 in that segment, f(x) = -x. So for any x between -4.4 and -1, f(x) is between 1 and 4.4. 



---------------

Therefore, the equation f(x)=3 has solutions in this segment. Wait a second! Wait, hold on. Wait, if

---------------

 f(y)=3, then y can be -3,1,5. But to get f(f(x))=3, we

---------------

 need f(x) to be one of those y's. However, when I considered f(x)= -3,1,5, I

---------------

 found only two solutions. But what about if f(x) is equal to other values that might lead to f(y)=3 through

---------------

 another path?

Wait no. Wait, no. The logic is correct. To have f(f(x))=3, f

---------------

(x) must be a value y where f(y)=3. Since f(y)=3 only when y is -3,1,5, then

---------------

 f(x) must be one of those three. So f(x) must equal to -3,1, or5. 



---------------

Therefore, only those three possibilities. Hence, only two solutions. 

Alternatively, maybe there are other y-values where f(y)=3?

---------------

 For example, maybe at x= something else?

Wait, let me see. The three points where f(y)=3 are at

---------------

 x=-3,1,5. Are there any other points on the graph where the y-coordinate is 3?

Looking at the first segment:

---------------

 from x=-4.4 to x=-1, f(x) is -x. So setting f(x)=3 →

---------------

 x=-3. Which is indeed in that segment (since -4.4 < -3 < -1). So that's

---------------

 the point (-3,3). 

Second segment: from x=-1 to 3, f(x)=x+2. Setting

---------------

 f(x)=3 gives x+2=3 →x=1. Which is in the domain. 

Third segment: from x=3 to 5.66, f(x)=8 -x. Setting to

---------------

 3 gives 8 -x=3 →x=5. Which is in the domain. 

Therefore, those three points are the only ones

---------------

 where f(y)=3. So that's correct. 

Therefore, the only possible y's are -3,1,5. 



---------------

Thus, the equations f(x)=y for those y's give 0,1,1 solutions. So total 2. 

Hmm

---------------

. Maybe the answer is 2. But let me check once more for f(x)=1 and f(x)=5.

---------------

 

Wait, perhaps when solving f(x)=1, even though x=-1 is the only solution, but maybe in another segment?



---------------

Wait, in the first segment, f(x)= -x. So when x=-1, f(x)=1, which

---------------

 is the end of the first segment. The second segment starts at x=-1 with f(x)=1. So x=-1 is included

---------------

 in both, but it's just one point. 

Similarly, x=3 is the end of the second segment and the start of the third, so only

---------------

 one point. 

Alternatively, maybe there are other x's where f(x)=1 or 5?

Wait, let me think

---------------

 of the entire graph:

The function f(x) is piecewise linear with three segments. Let me list the equations and their domains again:

1. For

---------------

 x ∈ [-4.4, -1]: f(x) = -x. This is a line from (-4.4,4.4) to (-1,1). 



---------------

2. For x ∈ [-1, 3]: f(x) =x+2. This is a line from (-1,1) to (3,5). 

3. For x ∈ [3,5.66]: f(x) =8 -x. This is a line from (3,5) to (5.66, ~

---------------

2.34). 

So, for f(x)=1:

In segment 1, solving -x=1 gives x=-1,

---------------

 which is in the domain. 

In segment 2, solving x+2=1 gives x=-1, which is the

---------------

 start of the segment, so included. 

In segment 3, solving 8 -x=1 gives x=7, which

---------------

 is outside. 

Thus, only x=-1. 

Similarly, for f(x)=5:

Segment 1: -x=5 →

---------------

x=-5 not in domain.

Segment 2: x+2=5 →x=3, which is the end of the segment. 

Segment 3:8 -x=5 →x=3, the

---------------

 start of the segment. 

Thus, only x=3. 

Therefore, two solutions. 

Hmm. Maybe the answer is indeed

---------------

 2. 

Alternatively, perhaps I missed the points where f(x) equals to the y-values at the other 3 points

---------------

?

Wait, the problem mentions dots at (-3,3), (1,3), (5,3). So maybe

---------------

 those are the only points where f(x)=3, so f(f(x))=3 requires f(x) to be one

---------------

 of those x-values (-3,1,5). 

Thus, the x's that map to -3,1,5 via

---------------

 f(x). 

Therefore, f(x)=-3: 0

f(x)=1:1 (x=-1)

f(x)=5:1 (x=3)

Total 

---------------

2. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem counts x=-3,1,5 as possible x's? Wait, no. Because

---------------

 f(f(x))=3 requires f(x) to be in {-3,1,5}, but the x's we

---------------

 are counting are the pre-images of those y's. 

Wait, but maybe x=-3 is a solution? Let me check

---------------

:

If x=-3, then f(-3)=3. Then f(f(-3))=f(3)=5.

---------------

 So f(f(-3))=5≠3. So x=-3 is not a solution. 

Similarly, x=1: f(1)=3, so f(f(1))=f(3)=5≠3. Not

---------------

 a solution. 

x=5: f(5)=3, so f(f(5))=f(3)=5≠3. Not

---------------

 a solution. 

Therefore, those x's where f(x)=3 do not satisfy f(f(x))=3. 



---------------

Therefore, only the x's that map to -3,1,5 are the ones to consider, which are 0,1,1.

---------------

 

Therefore, the answer must be 2. 

Hmm, maybe the answer is 2, but perhaps I made a mistake in the

---------------

 Asymptote code parsing? Let me check once more the Asymptote code for any other segments or points.

---------------

 

Looking back at the Asymptote code:

The first segment is drawn from xmin to -1, the second from -1 to3, third

---------------

 from3 to xmax. The dots at (-3,3), (1,3), (5,3) are on

---------------

 the graph. 

No other segments are mentioned. The commented line is for a horizontal line at y= -3? Let

---------------

 me see:

The commented line was:

// draw((min,(-(-9)-(0)*xmin)/3)--(xmax,(-(-9)-(0)*xmax)/3),linetype("6pt 6pt"));

This

---------------

 seems like it would draw a horizontal line at y=3, since the equation simplifies to y= [9 -0]/3 = 3. But

---------------

 it's commented out, so it's not part of the graph. So the horizontal line at y=3 is not part

---------------

 of the function. The three dots at (-3,3), (1,3), (5,3) are on

---------------

 the graph, but the line y=3 isn't. 

Therefore, the only points where f(x)=3 are those three dots

---------------

. 

Therefore, my conclusion is that there are 2 solutions. 

Wait, but let me consider if f(x) can be

---------------

 1 or5 at more points. For example, in the first segment, is there another x where f(x)=1?

---------------

 

Wait, f(x) in first segment is -x. So f(x)=1 only when x=-1, which is the endpoint

---------------

. 

In the second segment, f(x)=x+2=1 only at x=-1. 

Similarly, f

---------------

(x)=5 only at x=3. 

Thus, I think the answer is indeed 2. 

However, since

---------------

 this is an Olympiad problem, maybe there is a trick here. Let me think differently. 

Suppose someone interprets the graph

---------------

 as including open or closed endpoints differently. For example, if the first segment is up to but not including x=-1, then x=-1 would belong

---------------

 only to the second segment. But in the Asymptote code, the first segment is drawn to (-1, ...

---------------

), so it includes x=-1. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is discontinuous at x=-1 or x=3, but the dots are there

---------------

, and the lines connect, so it's continuous. 

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the inverse functions?

Let me try

---------------

 to sketch the graph mentally:

From left to right:

- Starting at x=-4.4, y=4.4,

---------------

 going down to (-1,1). So this is a line with slope -1.

Then, from (-1,1), going

---------------

 up to (3,5), slope +1.

Then, from (3,5) going down to (5.66, ~2.34), slope -1.

Thus

---------------

, the graph has three linear pieces. 

Now, the equation f(f(x))=3 requires f(x) to be in

---------------

 {-3,1,5}. 

Now, the question is, how many x satisfy f(x) = -3,1, or5. 

We

---------------

 already saw that f(x) =-3 has no solution.

f(x)=1 has one solution at x=-1.

f(x)=5 has one solution at x=3.

Thus

---------------

, total 2. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem counts the points where f(x) equals to those values in different segments as

---------------

 separate solutions?

Wait, for example, when solving f(x)=1, even though it's the same point x=-1, but

---------------

 maybe it's counted twice because it's in two segments? But no, it's a single point. 

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 the problem's graph is different? For example, maybe the third segment is different?

Wait, in the Asymptote code, the third segment is drawn from (3, [equation]) to (xmax, ...). The equation for

---------------

 the third segment is ( -(-16) - 2x ) / 2 = (16 -2x)/2=8 -x. So

---------------

 yes, slope -1, starting at (3,5). 

Alternatively, maybe the third segment is a different line?

---------------

 Let me see:

The code says:

draw((3,(-(-16)-(2)*3)/2)--(xmax,(-(-16)-(2)*xmax)/2),linewidth(1.2));

So

---------------

 for the starting point at x=3:

y = (16 - 2*3)/2 = (16-6)/2=10/2=5. So

---------------

 that's correct. 

Thus, the third segment is correct. 

Hmm, I think I have to go with 2 as

---------------

 the answer. Maybe the problem is designed to have two solutions. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the first step,

---------------

 thinking that f(y)=3 has three solutions, but perhaps there are more? 

Wait, let me recheck f(y)=3.



---------------

First segment: f(x)=-x=3 ⇒x=-3. Which is between -4.4 and -1.

---------------

 So yes.

Second segment: f(x)=x+2=3 ⇒x=1. Between -1 and 3. Yes.

Third segment: f(x)=8 -x=3 ⇒x=5. Between 3 and 5.66. Yes.

---------------

 

So three solutions for f(y)=3. 

Then, for each of those y's (which are -3,1,5), find

---------------

 x such that f(x)=y. 

So for y=-3: 0 solutions.

For y=1: x

---------------

=-1.

For y=5: x=3.

Total of 2. 

Therefore, I think the answer is 2. 



---------------

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the problem's initial interpretation. The Asymptote code draws some dots at

---------------

 (-4.32,4.32) and (5.56,2.44). These are likely

---------------

 the endpoints of the first and third segments, so they don't add any new solutions. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a

---------------

 horizontal line at y=3 which is part of the graph, but it's commented out. The commented line:

// draw((min,(-(-9)-(0)*xmin)/3)--(xmax,(-(-9)-(0)*xmax)/3),linetype("6pt 6pt"));

This

---------------

 line, if not commented, would draw a horizontal line at y=3 from x=min to x=xmax. Because the y

---------------

-coordinate is computed as [ -(-9) -0*x ]/3 = 9/3=3. So that

---------------

 would be a horizontal line at y=3 across the entire domain. But it's commented out, so not part of the graph. 



---------------

Therefore, the only points where f(x)=3 are the three dots. 

Thus, I think the answer is 2. 



---------------

Wait, but let me think once more of the entire process. Maybe I can visualize the function and the composition.

Suppose I want f(f(x)) =3. That

---------------

 means first applying f to x, getting some value y, then applying f again to y to get 3. So y

---------------

 must be such that f(y)=3, so y is -3,1,5. 

Thus, the x's are

---------------

 those that map to -3,1, or5 via f(x). 

The count for each:

- For y=-3: no

---------------

 x's.

- For y=1: x must be -1.

- For y=5: x must be 3.

Thus

---------------

, total 2 x's: x=-1 and x=3. 

Therefore, the answer is 2. 

Hmm

---------------

, maybe the answer is 2. I think that's correct. 

**Final Answer**
Answer: 2


To determine how many values of \( x \) satisfy \( f(f(x)) = 3 \), we need to analyze

---------------

 the given piecewise function \( f(x) \) and its graph. The function \( f(x) \) is defined as follows:

1. For \( x \in [-4.4, -1] \): \( f(x) = -x \)
2. For \( x \in [-1, 3] \): \( f(x) = x + 2 \)
3. For \( x \in [3, 5.66] \): \( f(x) = 8 - x \)

Key

---------------

 points on the graph where \( f(x) = 3 \) are at \( x = -3 \), \( x = 1 \), and \( x = 5 \). Therefore, the

---------------

 values of \( y \) such that \( f(y) = 3 \) are \( y = -3 \), \( y = 1 \), and \( y = 5 \).

Next, we need to find the number of solutions \( x \) such that \( f(x) = -3 \), \( f(x) = 1 \), or \( f(x) = 5 \):

1. **For \( f(x) = -3 \)**:
   - No

---------------

 solutions exist because solving \( -x = -3 \), \( x + 2 = -3 \), or \( 8 - x = -3 \) results

---------------

 in \( x = 3 \), \( x = -5 \), or \( x = 11 \), none of which are

---------------

 within the respective domains.

2. **For \( f(x) = 1 \)**:
   - The solution is \( x = -1 \)

---------------

 (endpoint of both the first and second segments).

3. **For \( f(x) = 5 \)**:
   - The solution is \( x = 3 \) (endpoint of both the second and third segments).

Summarizing the results:
- \( f(x) = -3 \) has 0 solutions.
- \( f(x) = 1 \) has 1 solution (\

---------------

( x = -1 \)).
- \( f(x) = 5 \) has 1 solution (\( x = 3 \)).

Thus, the total number of values of \( x \) that satisfy \( f(f(x)) = 3 \) is \( 0 + 1 + 1 = 2 \).

\[
\boxed{2}
