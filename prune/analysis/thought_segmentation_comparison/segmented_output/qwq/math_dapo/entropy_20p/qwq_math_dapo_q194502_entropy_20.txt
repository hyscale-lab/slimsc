Okay, let me try to solve this problem step by step. The question is asking for the value of (2^0 - 1 + 5^2 - 0)^-1 × 5, and then to express it as a fraction k/m and find the sum k + m. Hmm, let

---------------

 me break this down.

First, I need to simplify the expression inside the parentheses. Let's look at each term individually. 



---------------

Starting with 2^0. I remember that any number to the power of 0 is 1, right? So 2^0 should be 1. Then there's a minus 1. So 1 - 1 would be 0. Wait, but

---------------

 then there's also the 5^2 term. Let me make sure I parse this correctly.

The expression inside the parentheses is 

---------------

2^0 - 1 + 5^2 - 0. Let me write each part:

2^0 is 1.



---------------

Then subtract 1: 1 - 1 = 0.

Next, add 5^2. 5 squared is 25, so adding that gives 0 + 25 = 25.

Then subtract 0.

---------------

 Well, subtracting 0 doesn't change anything, so that's still 25.

So the entire expression inside the parentheses simplifies to 25. Therefore

---------------

, the first part is (25)^-1. 

Wait, let me double-check that. The original expression was

---------------

 (2^0 - 1 + 5^2 - 0). Let me recast it step by step:

2^0 = 1



---------------

Then subtract 1: 1 - 1 = 0

Then add 5^2: 0 + 25 = 25

Then subtract 0: 25 - 0 = 25. Yep

---------------

, that's correct. So the inside simplifies to 25.

So now the expression becomes (25)^-1 multiplied by 5. 

I

---------------

 know that a negative exponent means reciprocal, so 25^-1 is 1/25. Therefore, multiplying that by 5 would

---------------

 be (1/25) × 5. Let me compute that.

Multiplying 1/25 by 5: 5 divided by 25. That

---------------

 simplifies to 1/5, right? Because 5 divided by 25 is the same as 1/5. So

---------------

 the result is 1/5. 

Therefore, in the form k/m, that would be 1/5. So k is 1 and m is 5. Then

---------------

 the sum k + m is 1 + 5 = 6. 

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. Let me go through each

---------------

 step again.

Starting over:

Original expression: (2^0 -1 +5^2 -0)^-1 ×5.

Compute

---------------

 each term inside the parentheses:

2^0 = 1. Then subtract 1: 1 - 1 = 0.

5^2 is 25. Adding that to the previous result: 0 +25 =25.

Subtracting 0 gives

---------------

 25. So inside is 25. Then inverse is 1/25. Multiply by 5: 5*(1/25)= 5/25 =1/5. 



---------------

Yes, that seems right. So 1/5 is the value. So k is 1, m is 5, so their

---------------

 sum is 6. 

Hmm, but wait, let me check if the question requires the fraction to be in simplest terms. Since 1 and 5 have no common factors besides 1, that

---------------

's already reduced. So yes, 1/5 is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe I misread the original problem? Let me check again.

The problem

---------------

 is written as (2^0 - 1 +5^2 -0)^{-1} ×5. The operations

---------------

 inside are left to right except exponents first. So exponents first: 2^0 is 1, 5^2 is 25. Then the rest is arithmetic: 1 -1 +25 -0. So

---------------

 1-1 is 0, plus 25 is 25, minus 0 is still 25. So

---------------

 that's correct. 

Therefore, the inverse is 1/25, multiplied by 5 is indeed 1/5. So

---------------

 answer is 1/5, so k + m is 6. I think that's correct. 

Wait another thought: sometimes

---------------

 when there are multiple operations, order of operations can trip you. Let me confirm the order. Inside the parentheses, exponents are done first, then addition and subtraction left to right. So yes

---------------

, 2^0 and 5^2 first. Then the rest as is. So 1 -1 +25 -0. So

---------------

 yes, that's (1 -1) is 0, plus 25 is 25, then minus 0. So

---------------

 25. 

Therefore, the calculation is correct. So the final answer is 1/5, so sum is 6. 



---------------

I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in the steps. So the answer should be 6.


The expression inside the parentheses is simplified

---------------

 step by step as follows:

1. Calculate the exponents:
   - \(2^0 = 1\)
   - \(5^2 = 25\)

2. Substitute these values back into the expression:
   \[
   (1 - 1 + 25 - 0)
   \]

3. Perform the arithmetic operations from left to right:
   - \(1 - 1 = 0\)
   - \(0 + 25 = 25\)
   - \(25 - 0 = 25\)

Thus, the expression inside the parentheses simplifies to \(25\). The original expression becomes

---------------

:
\[
(25)^{-1} \times 5
\]

4. Compute the inverse of 25:
   \[
   25^{-1} = \frac{1}{25}
   \]

5. Multiply by 5:
   \[
   \frac{1}{25} \times 5 = \frac{5}{25} = \frac{1}{5}
   \]

The fraction

---------------

 \(\frac{1}{5}\) is already in simplest form, so \(k = 1\) and \(m = 5\). The sum \(k + m\) is:
\[
1 + 5 = 6
\]
