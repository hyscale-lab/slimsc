Okay, so I have this problem about a parabola and some points moving on it, and I need to show that the line connecting two specific

---------------

 intersection points always passes through a fixed point. Then, when a is 3, I have to find the x-coordinate of that fixed point. Hmm, let me start

---------------

 by understanding the problem step by step.

First, the parabola given is y² = 2px. So that

---------------

's a standard right-opening parabola with vertex at the origin. The parameters a and b are given for points A(a, b) and B(-a, 0), with the conditions that ab ≠ 0 and b² ≠ 2pa. So

---------------

 A isn't on the parabola since b² ≠ 2pa. B is at (-a, 0), so it

---------------

's on the x-axis, left of the origin.

M is any point on the parabola. Then, we consider

---------------

 the lines AM and BM. Each of these lines will intersect the parabola again at another point, M₁ and M₂ respectively. The task

---------------

 is to show that as M moves along the parabola (with the conditions that M₁ and M₂ exist and aren't the same point

---------------

), the line M₁M₂ always passes through a fixed point. Then, specifically when a=3, find the x-coordinate of that fixed point.

Alright, so first

---------------

, maybe I should parametrize the points on the parabola. Since it's y² = 2px, a standard parametrization would

---------------

 be using the parameter t where the coordinates are ( (t²)/(2p), t ). Wait, actually, let's see

---------------

: if we let y = t, then x = t²/(2p). Alternatively, sometimes people use parameter t for

---------------

 the slope, but maybe using coordinates in terms of a parameter might help.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinates ( (y²)/(2p), y )

---------------

 for any y. Hmm, perhaps parametrizing M as ( (t²)/(2p), t ) where t is a parameter. Let

---------------

 me try that.

Let me denote point M as ( (t²)/(2p), t ). Then, we can write the equations for lines AM and BM, find their other intersections M₁ and M₂ with the parabola, then find the equation of line M₁M₂ and see if it passes through a fixed point when

---------------

 a=3.

First, let me write coordinates for points:

Point A is (a, b) = (3, b) when a=3, but maybe

---------------

 I should keep a general for now and substitute a=3 at the end.

Point B is (-a, 0).

Point M is ( (t²)/(2p), t )



---------------

First, let's find the equation of line AM. Let's compute the equation of the line connecting A(a, b) and M( (t²)/(2p), t ).

The slope of AM would be (t - b) / [ (t²/(2p) - a ) ]

So

---------------

, the equation of line AM can be written as:

y - b = [ (t - b)/( (t²/(2p) - a ) ) ] (x - a )

Similarly, the

---------------

 equation of line BM connects B(-a, 0) and M( (t²/(2p), t )

Slope of

---------------

 BM is [ t - 0 ] / [ (t²/(2p) - (-a) ) ] = t / ( t²/(2p) + a )

Equation of BM is

---------------

 y - 0 = [ t / ( t²/(2p) + a ) ] (x + a )

Now, to

---------------

 find M₁ and M₂, which are the other intersection points of these lines with the parabola y² = 2px.

Let

---------------

 me first find M₁ by solving the equation of line AM with the parabola.

So, substitute y from the line equation into the parabola equation.

Let

---------------

 me denote line AM's equation as:

y = [ (t - b)/( (t²/(2p) - a ) ) ] (x - a ) + b

Let me denote

---------------

 the slope as m1 = (t - b)/( (t²/(2p) - a ) )

So, y = m1(x - a) + b

Sub

---------------

stitute this into y² = 2px:

[ m1(x - a) + b ]² = 2px

Expand the

---------------

 left side:

m1²(x - a)^2 + 2 m1 b (x - a) + b² = 2px

This

---------------

 is a quadratic in x. Since point M is already on both the line and the parabola, we know that x = t²/(2p) is one solution. The other solution will correspond to M₁.

Similarly

---------------

, to find the other intersection, we can factor out (x - t²/(2p)).

Alternatively, maybe there

---------------

's a better way. Let me think.

Alternatively, since we know that the line intersects the parabola at M and M₁, so

---------------

 the two solutions of the quadratic equation are x-coordinates of M and M₁. So if we can find the sum and product of roots, maybe

---------------

 we can find the x-coordinate of M₁.

The quadratic equation in x is:

m1²(x - a)^2 + 2 m1 b (x - a) + b² - 2px = 0

Wait

---------------

, perhaps expanding might be messy. Let me try to do it step by step.

Alternatively, maybe parametrize the line AM

---------------

 in terms of parameter and find the other intersection.

Alternatively, since the line passes through A(a, b) and M(t

---------------

²/(2p), t), then parametrizing the line as:

x = a + s*( (t²/(2p) - a)

---------------

 )

y = b + s*( t - b )

Where s=0 gives A, s=1 gives M. The

---------------

 other intersection M₁ is at another s value. Since the line intersects the parabola at two points: when s=1, it

---------------

's M, so the other point is when s = something else.

So substituting into the parabola equation:

y

---------------

² = 2p x

So [ b + s(t - b) ]² = 2p [ a + s( t²/(2p) - a ) ]

Let me expand this

---------------

:

Left side: b² + 2b s(t - b) + s²(t - b)^2

Right side: 2p a + 2p s ( t²/(2p) - a ) = 2p a + s t

---------------

² - 2p a s

So set left = right:

b² + 2b s(t - b) + s²(t - b)^2 = 2p a + s t² - 2p a s

Bring all terms to left:

b² + 2b s(t - b) + s²(t - b)^2 - 2p a - s t² + 2p a s = 0

Let

---------------

 me collect terms by power of s:

First, s² term:

(t - b)^2 s²

Then s terms:

2b(t - b)s - t² s + 2p a s

Constant

---------------

 term:

b² - 2p a

So:

s² (t - b)^2 + s [ 2b(t - b) - t² + 2p a ] + (b² - 2p a) = 0

We know that s = 1 is a solution (

---------------

since M is on the parabola and the line), so (s - 1) is a factor. Let's perform

---------------

 polynomial division or use the fact that sum of roots is -B/A.

Let me denote the quadratic equation as A s² + B s + C = 0,

---------------

 where:

A = (t - b)^2

B = 2b(t - b) - t² + 2p a

C = b² - 2p a

The

---------------

 product of roots is C/A = (b² - 2p a)/( (t - b)^2 )

But since

---------------

 one root is s=1, the other root s₁ must satisfy 1 * s₁ = C/A => s₁ = C/(A)



---------------

Thus the other solution is s = [ (b² - 2p a) ] / [ (t - b)^2 ]

Therefore

---------------

, the parameter s for M₁ is s₁ = (b² - 2p a)/( (t - b)^2 )

Therefore

---------------

, the coordinates of M₁ are:

x₁ = a + s₁ ( t²/(2p) - a )

y₁ = b + s₁ ( t - b )

Similarly, let

---------------

 me compute these expressions.

First, compute x₁:

x₁ = a + [ (b² - 2p a)/(

---------------

 (t - b)^2 ) ] * ( t²/(2p) - a )

Similarly, y₁ = b + [ (b² - 2p a)/( (t - b)^2 ) ] * ( t - b ) = b + [ (b² - 2p a)/(

---------------

 (t - b) ) ]

Wait, that simplifies:

y₁ = b + (b² - 2p a)/(t - b )



---------------

Let me compute that:

y₁ = [ b(t - b) + (b² - 2p a) ] / (t - b )

= [ b t - b² + b² - 2p a ] / (t - b )

= (b t - 2p a ) / ( t - b )

Similarly

---------------

 for x₁:

x₁ = a + [ (b² - 2p a) / (t - b)^2 ] * ( t²/(2p) - a )

Let me compute

---------------

 the term ( t²/(2p) - a ):

Let me write that as ( t² - 2p a ) / (2p )

So

---------------

 substituting back into x₁:

x₁ = a + [ (b² - 2p a) / (t - b)^2 ] * [ (t² - 2p a)/(

---------------

2p) ]

Thus,

x₁ = a + ( (b² - 2p a)(t² - 2p a) ) / [ 2p (t - b)^2 ]

Hmm, okay

---------------

, that's the x-coordinate. That looks a bit complicated, but maybe we can simplify.

Alternatively, maybe I can write

---------------

 expressions for x₁ and y₁ in terms of t, and similarly find expressions for M₂ by doing the same process for line BM.

Let

---------------

 me try that. Let me now find M₂, the other intersection of BM with the parabola.

Similarly, param

---------------

etrizing the line BM. Points B(-a, 0) and M( t²/(2p), t )



---------------

Parametrizing with parameter s again:

x = -a + s( t²/(2p) + a )

y = 0 + s( t - 0 ) = s t

So

---------------

 when s=0, we get B, and s=1 gives M. The other intersection M₂ is another s value.



---------------

Substitute into parabola equation y² = 2p x:

( s t )² = 2p [ -a + s( t²/(2p ) + a ) ]

Left

---------------

 side: s² t²

Right side: -2p a + 2p s ( t²/(2p ) + a ) = -2p a + s t² + 2p a s

Bring

---------------

 all terms to left:

s² t² + 2p a - s t² - 2p a s = 0

Factor

---------------

 terms:

s² t² - s t² - 2p a s + 2p a = 0

Factor

---------------

 terms with s:

s² t² - s ( t² + 2p a ) + 2p a =0

Again, since

---------------

 s=1 is a root (point M is on both the line and parabola), so (s -1) is a factor.

Let me write

---------------

 quadratic equation as:

t² s² - ( t² + 2p a ) s + 2p a =0

Let

---------------

 me denote A = t², B= - (t² + 2p a ), C=2p a

Sum

---------------

 of roots is -B/A = (t² + 2p a)/t²

Product of roots is C/A = 2p a / t²

Since one root is s=1, the

---------------

 other root s₂ must satisfy 1 * s₂ = product = 2p a / t² => s₂ = 2p a / t²

Therefore

---------------

, the other intersection point M₂ corresponds to s = 2p a / t²

Therefore, coordinates of M₂ are:

x₂ = -a + (2p a / t²)( t²/(2p) + a ) = -a + (2p a / t²)( t²/(2p) + a )

Let

---------------

 me compute that:

First term inside the parenthesis: t²/(2p) + a = ( t² + 2p a )/(2p )

Thus

---------------

,

x₂ = -a + (2p a / t²) * ( t² + 2p a )/(2p )

Simplify:

The 2p cancels with

---------------

 denominator:

= -a + ( a / t² ) ( t² + 2p a )

= -a + a + (2p a²)/t²

=

---------------

 (2p a²)/t²

Similarly, y₂ = s * t = (2p a / t² ) * t = 2p a / t

Therefore

---------------

, coordinates of M₂ are ( 2p a² / t² , 2p a / t )

Hmm, that's simpler

---------------

. So M₂ is ( 2p a² / t² , 2p a / t )

Now, so

---------------

 now I have coordinates for M₁ and M₂ in terms of t, so now I need to find the equation of the line M₁M₂ and see

---------------

 if it passes through a fixed point when a=3.

First, let me write expressions for coordinates of M₁ and M₂ in

---------------

 terms of t. Let me recap:

For M₁:

x₁ = a + [ (b² - 2p a)(t² - 2p a) ] / [ 2p (t - b)^2 ]

y

---------------

₁ = (b t - 2p a ) / ( t - b )

Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe I

---------------

 made a mistake here? Let me check again.

Wait, when I computed x₁, let me redo that step.

Earlier

---------------

, x₁ = a + [ (b² - 2p a) / (t - b)^2 ] * [ ( t²/(2p ) - a ) ]

Wait

---------------

, (t²/(2p ) - a ) is equal to ( t² - 2p a ) / (2p )

Therefore

---------------

,

x₁ = a + ( (b² - 2p a) / (t - b)^2 ) * ( t² - 2p a ) / ( 2p )

So

---------------

,

x₁ = a + ( (b² - 2p a)(t² - 2p a) ) / [ 2p (t - b)^2 ]

Hmm

---------------

, that's correct. Maybe there's a better way to simplify this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write everything in terms of t

---------------

, then find the equation of the line between M₁ and M₂, and see if it can be expressed as passing through a fixed point.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe there's a symmetry or some property here.

Alternatively, since the problem states that for any M (with the

---------------

 given conditions), the line M₁M₂ passes through a fixed point. Therefore, perhaps this fixed point can be found by choosing

---------------

 specific positions of M where calculations are easier, then see what the fixed point must be.

Maybe if I choose specific values of t (

---------------

parameter for M), compute M₁ and M₂, find the line equation, and see where these lines intersect. Since the

---------------

 fixed point should be common to all such lines, choosing two different Ms should give two lines, and their intersection is the fixed point. Then,

---------------

 check with a third M to confirm.

This might be a feasible approach.

Let me try that.

First, let me set

---------------

 a=3 as required, so the problem's final answer is when a=3. Let me proceed with a=3,

---------------

 so let me substitute a=3 in all equations. Maybe this will simplify things.

So let me set a=3,

---------------

 so points:

A is (3, b)

B is (-3, 0)

Then, M is ( t²/(2p), t )

First

---------------

, let me see if I can compute coordinates of M₁ and M₂ in terms of t when a=3.

First

---------------

, let's compute coordinates for M₁:

Starting with the previous expressions:

For M₁:

y₁ = (b t - 2p a

---------------

 ) / ( t - b )

Since a=3,

y₁ = (b t - 6p ) / ( t - b )

Similarly,

x₁ = 3 + [ (b² - 6p)(

---------------

 t² - 6p ) ] / [ 2p ( t - b )² ]

Hmm, that's still complicated

---------------

. Let me see if I can find expressions for M₁ and M₂ coordinates when a=3.

Alternatively, let's pick

---------------

 specific values for t and compute M₁ and M₂, then find the line equation, and see the intersection point.

Let

---------------

 me choose specific values of t and compute.

First, let me pick a simple value for t. Let me choose t = b.

---------------

 Wait, but in the problem statement, b² ≠ 2pa. Since a=3, that would mean b² ≠ 6p. So

---------------

 t can't be such that t = sqrt(2p * 3) or something, but since b is arbitrary (

---------------

as long as b² ≠6p), perhaps choosing t = b is allowed as long as b² ≠6p.

---------------

 Wait, but if t = b, then in the expression for y₁, the denominator becomes (t - b) =0, which would be undefined. So t

---------------

 cannot be equal to b, so maybe that's excluded.

Therefore, pick t such that t ≠ b. Let me choose

---------------

 t =0. Wait, if t=0, then point M is (0, 0), since x=0.

---------------

 But then, let's see:

Wait, plugging t=0 into the coordinates of M: (0, 0). But

---------------

 point B is (-3, 0). So line BM would be the line connecting (-3,0) and (0,0), which is the x-axis. The other

---------------

 intersection with the parabola would be where y=0 intersects y²=2px, which is at x=0 (

---------------

the origin) and x=0 again? Wait, no. Wait, the parabola y²=2px at

---------------

 y=0 has x=0. So the line BM is the x-axis, which only intersects the parabola at the origin (

---------------

when t=0, M is (0,0)), so in this case, the other intersection is the same point,

---------------

 so M₂ would coincide with M. But the problem states "when M₁, M₂ exist and M₁ ≠ M₂". So perhaps

---------------

 t=0 is invalid here because it would give M₂ = M. So maybe t=0 is excluded.

Hmm. Let me pick

---------------

 another t. Let me choose t = something else. Let's see.

Alternatively, pick t approaching infinity? Maybe that's

---------------

 too abstract. Let me try t = something manageable. Let's say t = sqrt(2p*3) + something

---------------

, but maybe that complicates.

Alternatively, pick p as 1 for simplicity. Since the problem doesn't specify p, maybe

---------------

 it cancels out? Wait, but the final answer is the x-coordinate of the fixed point when a=3, so maybe

---------------

 the result is independent of p or b? Wait, but the problem says "when a=3", so perhaps the fixed

---------------

 point's x-coordinate is a function of a, but with a=3, so maybe it's a numerical value. Hmm

---------------

.

Alternatively, maybe p is a fixed parameter here, but since the problem is to find the x-coordinate, perhaps the result

---------------

 is independent of p? Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps the coordinates can be expressed in terms of a, b, p, but when

---------------

 we set a=3, the x-coordinate becomes a specific value. Maybe I need to proceed more systematically.

Let me try

---------------

 to compute the equation of line M₁M₂ in terms of t, then see if it can be rewritten to show that

---------------

 it passes through a fixed point.

Let me denote coordinates for M₁ and M₂ when a=3.

First, for

---------------

 M₂, when a=3, coordinates are:

x₂ = (2p*(3)^2)/t² = 18p / t²

y₂ = 2p*3 / t = 6p / t

For

---------------

 M₁, when a=3:

y₁ = (b t - 6p ) / ( t - b )

x₁ = 3 + [ (b² - 6p)(t² - 6p ) ] / [ 2p ( t - b )² ]

Hmm, that

---------------

's still complicated. Let me see if I can write x₁ in terms of y₁.

Alternatively, perhaps express everything in terms of t

---------------

, then find the equation of the line between M₁ and M₂.

Let me denote coordinates of M₁ as (x₁, y₁) and M₂ as (x₂, y₂).

---------------

 The line between them can be parametrized, but maybe it's better to write the equation in terms of coordinates.

The line

---------------

 equation can be written as (y - y₁) = m (x - x₁), where m is the slope (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁)



---------------

Alternatively, to find if the line passes through a fixed point (h, k), then substituting (h, k) into the line equation must

---------------

 satisfy for all t.

Alternatively, suppose that the line M₁M₂ passes through a fixed point (h, 0)

---------------

 or some point. Maybe the fixed point is on the x-axis? Let me see.

Alternatively, let me try to find

---------------

 the equation of the line M₁M₂.

Let me denote the coordinates:

M₁: (x₁, y₁) = [ 3 + ( (b² - 6p)(t² - 6p) ) / (2p (t - b)^2 ), (bt - 6p)/(t - b) ]

M₂: (x₂, y₂) = ( 18p / t², 6p / t )

Let

---------------

 me compute the slope first:

m = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁ )

This might be messy

---------------

, but let's try.

First, compute numerator y₂ - y₁:

= [6p/t - (bt -6p)/(t - b) ]

Let

---------------

 me combine these terms:

= [6p(t - b) - (bt -6p)t ] / [ t(t - b) ]

Compute

---------------

 numerator:

6p(t - b) - t(bt -6p)

= 6pt -6p b - b t² +6p t

Combine like terms:

6pt +6pt = 12pt

---------------



- b t²

-6p b

Thus numerator: -b t² +12 p t -6 p b

Denominator: t(t - b )

Similarly

---------------

, the denominator x₂ - x₁:

x₂ - x₁ = [18p / t² - 3 - ( (b² -6p)(t² -6p) ) / (2p (t - b)^2 ) ]

This looks

---------------

 quite complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.

Alternatively, maybe consider that the fixed point must satisfy the equation of line M₁M₂ for all t, so substit

---------------

uting the coordinates of the fixed point (h, k) into the line equation must hold for all t, which gives equations that can be solved for h and k.

Sup

---------------

pose the fixed point is (h, k). Then, for all t, the point (h,k) lies on the line through M₁ and M₂. Thus

---------------

,

(y₂ - y₁)(h - x₁) = (x₂ - x₁)(k - y₁)

This must hold for all t.

---------------

 Let me write this equation.

But this equation must hold for all t, so coefficients of various powers of t must be zero. This

---------------

 might lead us to equations for h and k.

Alternatively, maybe there is a symmetry or property here. Let me think differently

---------------

.

Perhaps, instead of parametrizing M as (t²/(2p), t), maybe using parametric equations for

---------------

 the parabola with parameter m (the slope of tangent). But not sure.

Alternatively, since the problem states that the

---------------

 line M₁M₂ passes through a fixed point regardless of M's position, except when M₁ and M₂ coincide,

---------------

 so perhaps this fixed point can be found by considering two specific positions of M and computing the intersection point of the corresponding lines M₁M₂.

Let me try that approach

---------------

. Let me choose two different points M1 and M2, compute the lines, and find their intersection. Then check with a third point.

First

---------------

, let me choose a value for t, compute M₁ and M₂, get the line, then choose another t, get

---------------

 another line, find their intersection, and that should be the fixed point.

Let me pick specific values for p and b?

---------------

 Since the problem doesn't specify them, maybe the result is independent of b and p? Wait, but the problem says "

---------------

when a=3", so maybe the fixed point is in terms of a, so when a=3, it's a

---------------

 number. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps p is arbitrary? The problem states "抛物线 y²=2px", so p

---------------

 is a given parameter. But the problem says when a=3, find the x-coordinate of the fixed point. So maybe

---------------

 the fixed point's coordinates depend on a and p, but when a=3, the x-coordinate can be expressed in terms of p,

---------------

 but perhaps p cancels out? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe choosing specific values for p and b to simplify the calculation. Let me set

---------------

 p=1 and b= some value, say b=1 (as long as b² ≠2p a, so with

---------------

 a=3, b² ≠6, so b=1 is okay).

Let me set p=1 and b=1.

---------------

 Then, a=3.

So with these values:

The parabola is y² = 2x.

Point A is (3,1), point

---------------

 B is (-3,0).

Let me choose a point M on the parabola. Let's choose M such that it

---------------

's easy to compute.

Let me first pick M at (2, 2), since 2²=4=2*2, so yes

---------------

, (2,2) is on y²=2x.

Wait, y² = 2x, so if

---------------

 x=2, then y²=4, so y=2 or -2. Let me take (2,2).

So

---------------

 M is (2,2). Then, let me compute M₁ and M₂.

First, compute M₁, the other intersection of line AM with the parabola.

Line AM connects A(3,1) and M(2,2).

S

---------------

lope of AM is (2-1)/(2-3)=1/(-1)= -1.

Equation of line AM: y -1 = -1(x -3)

---------------

 → y = -x +4.

Find intersection with parabola y²=2x:

Substitute y = -x +4 into y²=2x:

(-x +4)^2 = 2x → x² -8x +16 =2x → x² -10x +16=0.

Solutions:

x = [10 ± sqrt(100 -64)]/2 = [10 ±6]/2 → 8 or 2.

So

---------------

 the intersections are at x=8 and x=2. Since M is at (2,2), the other point M₁ is at x=8.

---------------

 Then y = -8 +4 = -4. So M₁ is (8, -4).

Now, compute M₂, the other intersection of line BM with the parabola.

Line BM connects B(-3,0) and M(2,2).

Slope is (2 -0)/(2 - (-3)) =2/5.

Equation: y -0 = (2/5)(x +3).



---------------

So y = (2/5)x + 6/5.

Intersect with parabola y²=2x:

(

---------------

 (2/5 x +6/5 ) )² = 2x.

Expand left side:

(4/25)x² + (24/25)x + 36/25 =2x

Multiply both sides by 25:

4x² +24x +36 =50x

4

---------------

x² -26x +36=0

Divide by 2: 2x² -13x +18=0

S

---------------

olutions:

x = [13 ± sqrt(169 - 144)]/4 = [13 ±5]/4 → 18/4=4.5 or 8/4=2.

Thus,

---------------

 intersections at x=4.5 and x=2. So M₂ is (4.5, y). Compute y:



---------------

y=(2/5)(4.5) +6/5 = (9/5) +6/5 = 15/5=3. So M₂ is (4.5, 3).

Thus

---------------

, M₁ is (8, -4), M₂ is (4.5, 3). Now, find the equation of the line through (

---------------

8, -4) and (4.5,3).

Compute the slope: (3 - (-4))/(4.5 -8)=

---------------

7/(-3.5)= -2.

Equation: y - (-4) = -2(x -8)

---------------

 → y +4 = -2x +16 → y = -2x +12.

So the line equation is y = -2x +12.

Now, let me pick another point M on

---------------

 the parabola and compute another line M₁M₂ to see where they intersect.

Let me choose another M. Let's pick

---------------

 M at (0.5,1), since y²=2x → 1²=2*(0.5)=

---------------

1, so yes.

So M is (0.5,1).

Compute M₁: the other intersection of line AM with the parabola.

Line AM connects A(3,1) and M(0.5,1).

Since

---------------

 both points have y=1, the line is horizontal: y=1.

Intersect with parabola y²=2x →

---------------

 1=2x → x=0.5. So the line intersects at x=0.5 (which is M) and since

---------------

 it's horizontal, the other point would be where y=1, so x=0.5. Wait, that's

---------------

 the same point? Wait, that can't be. Wait, if the line is horizontal at y=1, then it

---------------

 intersects the parabola only at x=0.5. So there's only one intersection point, which is M itself. Hence

---------------

, M₁ does not exist, so this M is excluded by the problem's conditions (since M₁ must exist and M₁≠M₂). Therefore

---------------

, I can't choose this point.

Hmm, so I need to choose another point where the lines AM and BM both intersect the parabola at another distinct point.

Let me pick

---------------

 M as (8, 4), since y²=2x → 16=16, so x=8,

---------------

 so (8,4) is on the parabola.

Wait, (8,4): 4²=16, 2*8=16. Yes.

So M=(8,4). Compute

---------------

 M₁ and M₂.

First, M₁: other intersection of line AM with parabola.

Line AM connects A(3,1) and M(8,4).

Slope is

---------------

 (4-1)/(8-3)=3/5.

Equation: y -1 = (3/5)(x -3).



---------------

Thus, y = (3/5)x -9/5 +1 = (3/5)x -4/5.

Inter

---------------

sect with parabola y²=2x:

Substitute y = (3x/5 -4/5):



---------------

( (3x/5 -4/5 ) )² = 2x

Expand left side:

(9x²/25 - 24x/25 + 16/25 ) =2x

Multiply by

---------------

 25:

9x² -24x +16 =50x

9x² -74x +16=0

Solutions:

x = [74 ± sqrt(74² -4*9*16)]/(2*9)

Calculate discriminant: 5476 - 576 = 4900.



---------------

sqrt(4900)=70.

Thus, x=(74 ±70)/18.

So x

---------------

=(74+70)/18=144/18=8, which is M, and x=(74-70)/18=4/18=2/9 �

---------------

�0.222.

Thus, M₁ is at x=2/9. Compute y:

y=(3*(2/9)/5 -4/5)= (6/45 -4/5)= (2/15 -12/15)= -10/15= -2/3.

So

---------------

 M₁=(2/9, -2/3).

Now compute M₂, the other intersection of line BM with parabola.

Line BM connects B(-3,0) and M(8,4).

Slope is

---------------

 (4-0)/(8 - (-3))=4/11.

Equation: y -0 = (4/11)(x +3).



---------------

Thus, y=(4/11)x +12/11.

Intersect with parabola y²=2x:

(

---------------

 (4x/11 +12/11 ) )² =2x.

Expand left side:

(16x²/121 + 96x/121 +144/121 )=2x

Multiply both sides by 121:

16x² +96x +144 =242x

16x² -146x +144=0

Divide by 2: 8x² -73x +72=0

S

---------------

olutions:

x=(73 ±sqrt(73² -4*8*72))/(2*8)

Calculate

---------------

 discriminant: 5329 - 2304=3025.

sqrt(3025)=55.

Thus x=(73 ±55)/16.

First

---------------

 solution: (73+55)/16=128/16=8 (which is M),

---------------

 second solution: (73-55)/16=18/16=9/8=1.125.

Thus M₂ is at x=9/8. Compute y:

y=(4/11)(9/8) +12/11 = (36/88)+(

---------------

96/88)=132/88=3/2. So M₂ is (9/8, 3/2).

Now

---------------

, the line M₁M₂ connects (2/9, -2/3) and (9/8, 3/2). Let me find its equation.

First, compute the slope:

m=( 

---------------

3/2 - (-2/3) ) / (9/8 - 2/9 )

Compute numerator:

3/2 +2/3 = 9/6 +4/6 =13/6

Denominator:

9/8 -2/9 = (81 -16)/72=65/72

Thus slope m=

---------------

 (13/6) / (65/72)= (13/6)*(72/65)= (13*12)/65= (156)/65= 12/5 (

---------------

since 156 divided by 13 is 12, 65 divided by13 is 5).



---------------

So slope is 12/5.

Equation using point (9/8, 3/2):

y - 3/2 = (12/5)(x -9/8 )

Let

---------------

 me compute this equation:

Multiply out:

y = (12/5)x - (12/5)(9/8) + 3/2

Compute

---------------

 (12/5)(9/8)= (108)/40 =27/10

Thus

---------------

,

y = (12/5)x -27/10 +15/10 = (12/5)x -12/10 = (12/5)x -6/5.

So

---------------

 the equation is y = (12/5)x -6/5.

Now, we have two lines from two different Ms:

First line (

---------------

from M=(2,2)): y = -2x +12

Second line (from M=(8,4)): y = (12/5)x -6/5

Find

---------------

 their intersection point.

Set -2x +12 = (12/5)x -6/5

Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate denominators:

-10x +60 =12x -6

Bring terms

---------------

 to left:

-10x -12x +60 +6=0 → -22x +66=0 → -22x= -66 → x=3.

Then y

---------------

= -2*(3)+12=6. So the intersection point is (3,6).

Wait, but let

---------------

 me check with the second equation: y=(12/5)(3) -6/5 = 36/5 -6/5=30/5=6. Yes

---------------

, correct.

Hmm, so with a=3, p=1, b=1, the fixed point is (3,6). But

---------------

 the problem says "when a=3, find the x-coordinate of the fixed point". So the x-coordinate is 3?



---------------

Wait, but let me check with another point to confirm.

Let me choose another M, say M=( (t^2)/2, t ).

---------------

 Let me pick t=1. Then M=(0.5,1). Wait, but earlier that led to a line

---------------

 with only one intersection point. Wait, but maybe choosing another t.

Wait, let's choose M=( ( (sqrt(2))^

---------------

2 )/2, sqrt(2) ) → M=(1, sqrt(2)). Let me use this point.

Wait

---------------

, but with p=1, then y²=2x, so for M=(1, sqrt(2)): (sqrt(2))²=2*

---------------

1=2, so yes.

Compute M₁ and M₂.

First, line AM connects A(3,1) and M(1, sqrt(2)).

S

---------------

lope is (sqrt(2)-1)/(1-3) = (sqrt(2)-1)/(-2)

Equation of line AM: y -1 = [ (sqrt(2)-1)/(-2) ] (x -3 )

This

---------------

 seems messy, but let's proceed.

Intersect with parabola y²=2x.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better

---------------

 to compute coordinates numerically.

Let me compute numerically with t= sqrt(2) ≈1.414.



---------------

Compute M₁:

Using the parametrization earlier, but perhaps it's too involved. Alternatively, compute numerically.

Alternatively

---------------

, let's use the previous method.

Let me choose M=( (5)^2/(2*1),5 )=(

---------------

25/2,5). So M=(12.5,5). Let's see.

Compute M₁ and

---------------

 M₂.

First, line AM connects (3,1) and (12.5,5).

Slope is

---------------

 (5-1)/(12.5 -3)=4/9.5=8/19.

Equation: y -1 = (8/19)(x-3)



---------------

Thus, y = (8/19)x -24/19 +1 = (8/19)x -5/19

Intersect with parabola y²=2x:

(

---------------

 (8x/19 -5/19 ) )² =2x

Expand:

(64x² -80x +25)/361 =2x

Multiply by 361:

64x² -80x +25 =722x

64x² -802x +25=0

S

---------------

olutions:

x=(802 ±sqrt(802² -4*64*25))/128

Compute

---------------

 discriminant:

802²=643204

4*64*25=6400

Thus

---------------

 sqrt(643204 -6400)=sqrt(636804). Hmm, sqrt

---------------

(636804)= approx 798. So exact value?

Wait 798² = 

---------------

636,804. Exactly. So sqrt(636804)=798.

Thus,



---------------

x=(802 ±798)/128.

First solution: (802+798)/128=1600/128=12.5 (which

---------------

 is M), second solution: (802-798)/128=4/128=1/32≈

---------------

0.03125.

Thus M₁ is (1/32, y). Compute y:

y=(8/19)(1/32) -5/19 =

---------------

 (8/(19*32) ) -5/19 = (1/76 -5/19)= (1 -20)/76= -19/76= -0.25.

So M₁=(1/32, -0.25).

Now compute M₂,

---------------

 the other intersection of BM with parabola.

Line BM connects B(-3,0) and M(12.5,5).

Slope is

---------------

 (5-0)/(12.5+3)=5/15.5=10/31.

Equation: y =

---------------

 (10/31)(x +3).

Intersect with parabola y²=2x:

( (10(x+3)/31 ) )² =2x



---------------

Expand left side:

100(x+3)² / 961 =2x

Multiply by 961:

100(x² +6x +9)=1922x

100x² +600x +900 =1922x

100x² -1322x +900=0

Divide by 2: 50x² -661x +450=0

S

---------------

olutions:

x=(661 ±sqrt(661² -4*50*450))/100

Compute discriminant:

661² =437,  let

---------------

 me compute 660² +2*660 +1=435600 +1320 +1=436921.



---------------

4*50*450=90,000

Thus discriminant=436921 -90000=346,921.



---------------

sqrt(346,921)= let's see, 589²=346,921 (

---------------

since 600²=360000, 589²=(600-11)^2=600² -2*600*11 +121=360000 -13200 +121=346921.

---------------

 Yes.

Thus sqrt(346921)=589.

Thus,

x=(661 ±589)/100.

First solution: (661+589)/100=1250/100=12.5 (M

---------------

), second solution: (661-589)/100=72/100=0.72.

Thus M₂=(0.72, y). Compute y:

y=(10/31)(0.72 +3)= (10/31)(3.72)= (

---------------

37.2)/31≈1.2. Exactly, 3.72 is 372/100=93/25.



---------------

Thus y=(10/31)(93/25 +3) ?

Wait, better:

y=(10/31)*(0.72 +3)= (10/31)*(3.72)= (

---------------

10*3.72)/31=37.2/31= 1.2. Since

---------------

 31*1.2=37.2.

Thus M₂=(0.72,1.2).



---------------

Now, find equation of line between M₁(1/32, -0.25) and M₂(0.72,1.2).

Compute

---------------

 slope:

(1.2 - (-0.25))/(0.72 -1/32 )

Convert 1/32 to

---------------

 decimal: 0.03125. So denominator is 0.72 -0.03125=0.68875.

Numerator:1.45.

Thus

---------------

 slope m=1.45 /0.68875 ≈2.105. Hmm, exact

---------------

 fractions?

Let me compute exactly:

Coordinates:

M₁=(1/32, -1/4 ), M₂=(1

---------------

8/25, 6/5 )

Wait, 0.72 is 18/25 (

---------------

since 18 divided by25 is 0.72). 1.2 is 6/5.

So

---------------

 M₁ is (1/32, -1/4), M₂ is (18/25,6/5).



---------------

Slope:

(6/5 - (-1/4 )) / (18/25 -1/32 )

Compute numerator:

6/5 +1/4 = (24/20 +5/20)=29/20

Denominator:

18/25 -1/32 = (18*32 -25)/ (25*32)=

---------------

 (576 -25)/800=551/800

Thus slope m= (29/20)

---------------

 / (551/800)= (29/20)*(800/551)= (29*40)/551= 1160/551 �

---------------

�2.105.

Thus the equation is:

y - (-1/4 ) = (1160/551)(x -1/32 )

We

---------------

 need to see if this line passes through (3,6).

Let me plug x=3 into the equation and see if y=6.

First

---------------

 compute the right side:

(1160/551)(3 -1/32)= (1160/551)*(95/32)=

---------------

 (1160*95)/(551*32)

Let me compute numerator and denominator:

1160*

---------------

95: 1160*90=104400, 1160*5=5800 → total 110200

5

---------------

51*32=17632

So (110200)/17632 �

---------------

�6.25

Then, add the -(-1/4)= +0.25:

y=6.25 +0.25=6.5?

---------------

 Wait, no, wait.

Wait, the equation is y +1/4 = m*(x -1/32),

---------------

 so y= m*(x -1/32) -1/4.

Wait, let me recast:

Starting

---------------

 with point M₁ (1/32, -1/4):

y - (-1/4) = m (x -1/32 )



---------------

So y = m(x -1/32 ) -1/4

Plugging x=3:

y= (1160/551)*(3 -1/32) -1/4



---------------

Compute 3 -1/32 = 95/32

Thus:

y= (1160/551)*(95/32) -1/4

Compute

---------------

 numerator: 1160*95 = let's compute 1000*95=95,000;

---------------

 160*95=15,200 → total 110,200

Denominator: 551*32=17,632

Thus first

---------------

 term is 110200 /17632 ≈6.25 (since 17632*6=105,792; 17632*6.25=105,792 +4

---------------

,408=110,200). So exact value 6.25.

Second term:

---------------

 1/4=0.25.

Thus total y=6.25 -0.25=6. So

---------------

 yes, it passes through (3,6).

Therefore, with a=3, p=1, b=1, the fixed point is (3,6). Therefore

---------------

, the x-coordinate is 3.

Wait, but in the first case, when I chose M=(2,2) with

---------------

 p=1, the fixed point was (3,6). The second case with M=(8,4) also gave

---------------

 the same point. The third case with M=(12.5,5) also passed through (3,6). So

---------------

 it's consistent.

Therefore, when a=3, the fixed point has x-coordinate 3.

Therefore, the answer should be 3.

But

---------------

 let me check if this is independent of b and p. In the example, I set p=1 and b=1, but the

---------------

 problem didn't specify these. However, in the problem statement, the fixed point's x-coordinate is asked when a=3, so

---------------

 maybe it's always 3 regardless of p and b?

Alternatively, perhaps in the general case, the fixed point is (a, 

---------------

2b), but in my example with a=3 and b=1, it was (3,2), but in

---------------

 my calculation it was (3,6). Wait, no, that doesn't align. Wait in my example with p=1, b

---------------

=1, the fixed point was (3,6). Hmm.

Wait, maybe I need to see the general case.



---------------

Let me try to find the fixed point in terms of a and b.

Suppose that the fixed point is (h, k). The

---------------

 line M₁M₂ must pass through (h,k) for any t.

Let me denote the coordinates of M₁ and M₂ in

---------------

 terms of t and set up the equation.

First, for general a and p, but when a=3, we can

---------------

 substitute.

Recall coordinates of M₁ and M₂:

M₁ coordinates (with a general):

x₁ = a + (

---------------

 (b² - 2pa)(t² -2pa) ) / [ 2p(t - b)^2 ]

y₁ = (bt - 2pa)/(

---------------

t - b )

M₂ coordinates:

x₂ = 2pa² / t²

y₂ = 2pa / t

The

---------------

 line M₁M₂ has to pass through (h,k).

The condition is that for all t ≠0, b, etc

---------------

., the determinant:

| x₁   y₁   1 |

| x₂   y₂   1 |

| h    k    1 |

must

---------------

 be zero.

Alternatively, the equation (y₂ - y₁)(h -x₁) = (x₂ -x₁)(k - y₁)



---------------

This must hold for all t. Let me write this equation.

Let me denote:

Let me first compute (y₂ - y₁):

y

---------------

₂ - y₁ = (2pa/t) - [ (bt - 2pa)/(t - b) ]

Let

---------------

 me write this as:

= [2pa(t - b) - t(bt -2pa) ] / [ t(t - b) ]

Compute

---------------

 numerator:

2pa(t - b) - t(bt -2pa) =2pat -2pa b -bt² +2pa t

= (2pat +2pat) - bt² -2pa b

=4pat -bt² -2pa b

So

---------------

 numerator: -bt² +4pat -2pa b

Denominator: t(t -b )

Similarly, (x₂ -x₁):

x₂ -x₁ = (2pa²/t

---------------

² ) - [ a + ( (b² -2pa)(t² -2pa) )/(2p(t -b)^2 ) ]

This is

---------------

 complicated. Let me see if there's a better way.

Alternatively, perhaps suppose that h is the x-coordinate we need,

---------------

 and k can be expressed in terms of h. Since the problem only asks for h when a=3, maybe we can find

---------------

 h such that the x-coordinate is fixed, and k can vary, but in our examples, it was (3,6).

---------------

 Wait, but in the example, a=3, so h=3. Let me see if h=a is the fixed

---------------

 x-coordinate.

If so, then the x-coordinate is a, so when a=3, it's 3. Let

---------------

 me test this.

Assume h=a, then let me see if the equation can be satisfied for any t.

Suppose h=a.

---------------

 Then, plug h=a into the condition equation:

(y₂ - y₁)(a -x₁) = (x₂ -x₁)(k - y₁ )

But

---------------

 we still have k, but maybe k is determined such that the equation holds for all t.

Alternatively, perhaps the fixed point is (a, 2b).

---------------

 In the example, with a=3 and b=1, that would be (3,2), but in our example

---------------

 it was (3,6). Hmm, so that doesn't align. Alternatively, maybe (a, 2pa/b).

---------------

 Wait with a=3, p=1, b=1, that would be (3,6), which matches the

---------------

 example. Wait, 2pa/b = 2*1*3 /1=6. Yes.

Wait, so

---------------

 perhaps the fixed point is (a, 2pa/b ). Let me see.

Let me suppose the fixed point is (a, 2pa/b ).

---------------

 Let me check this.

Let me denote (h,k)=(a, 2pa/b )

Then, substitute into the line

---------------

 equation.

Let me compute the left side: (y₂ - y₁)(h -x₁) = (y₂ - y₁)(a -x₁ )

Right

---------------

 side: (x₂ -x₁)(k - y₁ ) = (x₂ -x₁)(2pa/b - y₁ )

We

---------------

 need to see if these are equal.

Let me compute both sides.

First, compute left side:

(y₂ - y₁)(a -x₁ )

We

---------------

 already have y₂ - y₁ = [ -bt² +4pat -2pa b ] / [ t(t -b ) ]

And

---------------

 a -x₁ = a - [ a + ( (b² -2pa)(t² -2pa) )/(2p(t -b)^2 ) ]

S

---------------

implify:

a -x₁ = - [ (b² -2pa)(t² -2pa) ) ] / [2p(t -b)^2 ]

Thus,

Left side:



---------------

[ (-bt² +4pat -2pa b ) / (t(t -b )) ] * [ - ( (b² -2pa)(t² -2pa) ) / (2p(t -b)^2 ) ]

=

---------------

 [ (-bt² +4pat -2pa b ) * ( - (b² -2pa)(t² -2pa) ) ] / [ t(t -b ) * 2p(t -b)^2 ) ]

=

---------------

 [ (bt² -4pat +2pa b )(b² -2pa)(t² -2pa) ) ] / [ 2p t (t -b)^3 )

---------------

 ]

Right side:

(x₂ -x₁)(2pa/b - y₁ )

First compute 2pa/b - y₁:

2pa/b - y₁ = 2pa/b - [ (bt -2pa)/(t -b) ]

=

---------------

 [ 2pa(t -b) - b(bt -2pa) ] / [ b(t -b) ]

Expand

---------------

 numerator:

2pa t -2pa b -b² t + 2pa b = (2pa t -b² t ) + (-2pa b +2pa b )

= t(2pa -b² )

Thus,

2pa/b - y₁ = [ t(2pa -b² ) ] / [ b(t -b) ]

Now

---------------

 compute (x₂ -x₁):

x₂ -x₁ = (2pa² / t² ) - x₁



---------------

But x₁ = a + ( (b² -2pa)(t² -2pa) )/(2p(t -b)^2 )

Thus

---------------

,

x₂ -x₁ = (2pa² / t² ) - a - ( (b² -2pa)(t² -2pa) )/(2p(t -b)^2 )

This

---------------

 expression seems complicated. Let me see if there's a better way.

Alternatively, perhaps this approach is too algebra-heavy. Since

---------------

 in our numerical example with a=3, the fixed point was (3,6), which is (a, 2pa/b).

---------------

 In that case, with a=3, p=1, b=1: 2*1*3/1=6, so that

---------------

 works.

Therefore, perhaps the fixed point is (a, 2pa/b). Therefore, when a=3, the

---------------

 x-coordinate is a=3, so the answer is 3.

Alternatively, in the problem statement, it says "求

---------------

出这个定点的横坐标", so the x-coordinate of the fixed point when a=3 is 3.

Therefore, the

---------------

 answer is 3.

But let me confirm with another example where a=3, but different b and p.

Suppose a=3, p

---------------

=2, b=2 (so that b²=4 ≠ 2pa=12, so okay).

Then

---------------

 the fixed point should be (3, 2*2*3/2)= (3,6). Let me verify

---------------

 with a quick calculation.

Let me choose M=(2, sqrt(2*2*2))= (2, sqrt(8))

---------------

≈(2, 2.828). Let's compute M₁ and M₂.

Wait, but this might take time. Alternatively, since

---------------

 the previous example worked and the general expression suggests it's (a, 2pa/b), but in the problem statement's

---------------

 conditions, b is given, but the problem says "当a=3时，求出这个定点的横坐标".

---------------

 The problem may not require the y-coordinate, just the x-coordinate, which is a=3. Hence, the answer is 3.

Therefore

---------------

, the final answer is 3.

**Final Answer**
Answer: 3


Given the parabola \( y^2 = 2px \) and fixed points \( A(a, b) \) and \( B(-a, 0) \) with \( ab \neq 0 \) and \( b^2 \neq 2pa \), we need to show that the line \( M_1M_2 \) (

---------------

where \( M_1 \) and \( M_2 \) are the other intersections of lines \( AM \) and \( BM \) with the parabola) passes through a fixed point when \( a = 3 \).

---------------

 We then find the x-coordinate of this fixed point.

1. **Parametrization of Points**:
   - Point \( M \) on the parabola can be parametrized as \( \left( \frac{t^2}{2p}, t \right) \).

2. **Equations of Lines**:
   - **Line \( AM \)**:


---------------

     - Slope: \( \frac{t - b}{\frac{t^2}{2p} - a} \)
     - Equation: \( y - b = \frac{t - b}{\frac{t^2}{2p} - a}(x - a) \)
   - **Line \( BM \)**:
     - Slope: \( \frac{t}{\frac{t^2}{2p} + a} \)

 then find the line equation for \( M_1M_2 \).
   - For example, with \( p = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), and \(

---------------

 a = 3 \), we find the intersection point of lines from different \( M \) values consistently results in the point \( (3, 6) \).
