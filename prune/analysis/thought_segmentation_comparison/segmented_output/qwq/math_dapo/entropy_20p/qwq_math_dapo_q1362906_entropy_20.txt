Okay, so I need to figure out how many ordered quadruples (a, b, c, d) of positive integers satisfy the equation a! * b! * c! * d! = 24!. Hmm, factor

---------------

ials can get pretty big, so maybe there's a way to break this down using prime factors?

First, let me recall that factor

---------------

ials can be expressed as products of primes. Maybe if I factorize 24! into its prime components, then the

---------------

 product a!b!c!d! must have exactly those exponents for each prime. That sounds like a plan. Let me try that.

First

---------------

, I need to find the prime factorization of 24!. The primes up to 24 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23. For

---------------

 each of these, I need to find their exponents in 24!.

Starting with 2:

The exponent of 2 in 24! is floor(24/2) + floor(24/4) + floor(24/8) + floor(24/16) + floor(24/32)

---------------

 = 12 + 6 + 3 + 1 + 0 = 22.

Similarly for 3:

floor(24/3) + floor(24/9) + floor(24/27) = 8 + 2 + 0 = 10.

5:

floor(24/5) + floor(24/25) = 4 + 0 = 4.

7:

floor(24/7) + floor(24/49) = 3 + 0 = 3.

11:

floor(24/11) = 2.

13:

floor(24/13) = 1.

17:

floor(24/17) = 1.

19:

floor(24/19) = 1.

23:

floor(24/23) = 1.

So the

---------------

 prime factorization of 24! is 2^22 * 3^10 * 5^4 * 7^3 * 11^2 * 13^1 * 17^1 * 19^1 * 23^1.

Now, the

---------------

 product a!b!c!d! must equal this. Each of a!, b!, c!, d! is a factorial, so their prime

---------------

 exponents must add up to the exponents in 24!.

Therefore, for each prime p, the sum of exponents of p in a!, b!, c!, d! must equal the exponent in 24!.

This

---------------

 seems complicated because there are multiple primes involved. Maybe there's a way to approach this by considering the exponents of each prime separately,

---------------

 and then multiplying the number of solutions for each prime?

Wait, but actually, the exponents of different primes are not independent because

---------------

 the factorials are interdependent. For example, the exponent of 2 in a! is related to the exponent of 3 in a! because

---------------

 they both depend on the same factorial. Hmm, so maybe this complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a way to model

---------------

 this problem by considering the sizes of a, b, c, d. Since factorials grow so quickly, the numbers a, b, c, d can't be too large. Since

---------------

 24! is the product, each of a, b, c, d must be less than or equal to 24. But

---------------

 actually, they can be equal to 24, but maybe not all of them can be too big.

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 the problem is similar to partitioning the number 24 into four integers a, b, c, d such that their

---------------

 factorials multiply to 24!? But that might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of this as a

---------------

 problem where each of a, b, c, d must be between 1 and 24, and the product of their factorials equals

---------------

 24!.

Alternatively, maybe the key is that the maximum of a, b, c, d must be 24,

---------------

 because otherwise, if all of them are less than 24, their factorials would multiply to something less than 24!.

Wait, actually

---------------

, even if one of them is 24, then the product would have at least 24!, so if another

---------------

 factorial is multiplied, the product would be larger. Wait, that suggests that only one of them can be 24?

---------------

 Because if two of them are 24, then 24! * 24! would already be way larger than 24!.

Therefore

---------------

, exactly one of a, b, c, d must be 24, and the rest must be 1? But

---------------

 then the product would be 24! *1! *1! *1! =24! which works. But

---------------

 that would give 4 possibilities (since any one of the four positions can be 24). But maybe there are more possibilities where

---------------

 some of them are less than 24 but their product still multiplies to 24!.

Wait, perhaps not.

---------------

 Let me think again. Suppose one of them is 24, and the others are 1, then yes, that

---------------

 works. Alternatively, maybe some of them can be 23, but then 23! times something else would need

---------------

 to multiply to 24!.

Wait, 24! =24 *23! So if one of the factor

---------------

ials is 23!, then another factorial would have to be 24, but 24 is not a factorial of

---------------

 an integer. Wait, 24 is 4!, so maybe that could be a way?

Wait, 24! =23! *24,

---------------

 but 24 is 4! so 24! =23! *4! So then, if we

---------------

 have two factorials: 23! and 4! and the other two are 1! then the product would be 23!*4!*1!*1! =24!.



---------------

So that gives another possibility: one 23, one 4, and two 1's. So that would be 

---------------

4 choose 1 (position for 23) times 3 choose 1 (position for 4), so 4*3=12 possibilities

---------------

. Hmm, so that's another 12. So now total 4 +12=16?

Wait, but maybe

---------------

 even more possibilities. Let me see. Let me think step by step.

Alternatively, maybe the problem can be approached by considering that

---------------

 the product a!b!c!d! =24! implies that the multiset {a, b, c, d} must include

---------------

 all the prime factors of 24!.

But perhaps the key is that the maximum among a,b,c,d must be exactly

---------------

 24? Because if the maximum is less than 24, say 23, then the product would be at most (23!)^4, which is way larger

---------------

 than 24!.

Wait, actually, no. Wait, 23! is smaller than 24!, so (

---------------

23!)^4 would be much smaller than (24!)^4, but 24! is much bigger

---------------

 than 23!.

Wait, actually, if all four numbers are less than 24, then the product of their factorials would be less

---------------

 than (24!)^4, but that's not helpful. Hmm, perhaps my initial thought was wrong.

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 the maximum among a, b, c, d must be 24. Otherwise, if all are less than 24, then each

---------------

 factorial is a divisor of 24!.

Wait, but 24! divided by the product of four smaller factorials must

---------------

 still be an integer? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the product of the four factorials equals 24!.



---------------

So perhaps the way to think is that each of the four numbers a, b, c, d must be less than or equal to 24, and their

---------------

 factorials multiply to 24!.

So, perhaps we can think in terms of partitioning 24 into four numbers

---------------

 where the product of their factorials is 24!.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is similar to writing 24! as a product of four factorials, and

---------------

 counting the number of ordered quadruples.

This seems similar to factorizations into factorials, but ordered.

Alternatively, perhaps the

---------------

 problem can be approached by considering that the four numbers a, b, c, d must be such that when you multiply their factorials, you get 24!.

Let

---------------

 me think of possible cases where this can happen.

Case 1: One of them is 24, and the rest

---------------

 are 1. Then the product is 24! *1*1*1 =24!.

There are 4 such

---------------

 quadruples (each position can be the 24).

Case 2: One of them is 23, then

---------------

 we have 23! * something =24!.

Since 24! =24 *23!, so the

---------------

 remaining three factorials must multiply to 24. Since 24 is 4!.

So, the remaining three factor

---------------

ials must multiply to 4!.

Thus, the product of three factorials is 4!.

Possible triples (since they are

---------------

 ordered, but let's first find unordered and then count permutations).

Factorials up to 4! are 1!,2!,3!,4!.

We

---------------

 need three factorials multiplying to 4!.

Possible options:

- 4! *1! *1! =24*1*1=24.

---------------

 So that's one way.

- 3! *2! *2! =6*2*2=24. Hmm

---------------

, 6*2*2=24. Yes.

- 2! *2! *6 (but 6 isn't a factorial.

---------------

 Wait, 3! is 6, but 3! *2! *2! is the second case.

Wait

---------------

, 2! *2! *3! =2*2*6=24. That's the same as the

---------------

 second case.

Alternatively, 2! *3! *2!.

Alternatively, 4! *1! *1!.



---------------

Alternatively, are there other combinations?

What about 1! *1! *24, but 24 is not a factorial except

---------------

 4!.

So, 24 can only be represented as 4!.

Alternatively, can we have 2! * 

---------------

2! * 6, but 6 is 3!.

Wait, so the possible triples (unordered) are:

Either

---------------

 [4!,1!,1!] or [3!,2!,2!].

Therefore, for the case where one of the numbers

---------------

 is 23, the remaining three factorials must be either (4!,1!,1!) or (3!,2!,2!).

So

---------------

 for each such case, how many ordered triples are there?

First case: [4!,1!,1!]. The number

---------------

 of ordered triples is 3 (since the 4! can be in any of the three positions, and the rest are 1!

---------------

s).

Second case: [3!,2!,2!]. The number of ordered triples is 3 (the 3! can be in any of the three positions, and the other

---------------

 two are 2!s).

Therefore, total ordered triples for this case: 3 +3 =6.

Since the

---------------

 23 can be in any of the four positions, the total quadruples for this case would be 4 *6=24.

Wait, but

---------------

 hold on, in this case, the 23 is fixed in one position, and the remaining three positions must multiply to 24.

---------------

 The three factorials can be arranged in 6 ways each? Wait, let me rephrase.

Suppose one of the quadr

---------------

uple elements is 23 (so 23! is part of the product). The remaining three elements need to have factorials multiplying

---------------

 to 24, which is 4!.

So, the remaining three numbers (let's call them x,y,z) must satisfy x! y

---------------

! z! =4!.

Possible triples (x,y,z):

Either (4,1,1), (1,4,1), (1,1,4),

---------------

 which are three permutations, or (3,2,2), (2,3,2), (2,2,3), which are three permutations. So total 6 ordered triples.



---------------

Hence, for each position of the 23, we have 6 ordered triples for the remaining three numbers, so total 4*

---------------

6=24 quadruples here.

Case 2 gives 24 quadruples.

Case 3: Suppose two of the numbers are 23 and

---------------

 2? Wait, but 23! *23! would already be way larger than 24!.

Wait, no

---------------

, actually, 23! *23! is way larger than 24!.

So, we can't have two numbers greater

---------------

 than or equal to 23. So, the maximum number of 23's is one?

Similarly, perhaps we

---------------

 can consider cases where one number is 22?

Wait, let's see. Let me see if there are more cases beyond

---------------

 case1 and case2.

Case3: Suppose one of the numbers is 22, then 22! *

---------------

 something =24!.

24! =24×23×22!.

So, the remaining three factorials must multiply to 24×23.

---------------

 But 24×23 is 552. However, 552 must be the product of three factorials. Let

---------------

's see if that's possible.

Factorials up to 5! (120) since 6! is 720 which is bigger

---------------

 than 552. Let's see:

Possible factorials: 1!,2!,3!,4!,5!.

Looking

---------------

 for three factorials whose product is 552.

First, factorize 552: 552=

---------------

8×69=8×3×23. Hmm, but 23 is prime. Since factorials can

---------------

't have prime factors larger than themselves. Wait, but 23 is a prime factor here. So, since 23 is a

---------------

 prime, it must come from one of the factorials. Since 23 is in 23! and 24!,

---------------

 but in the remaining factorials (the ones multiplying to 552), which are part of the product. Wait, but 

---------------

23 is a prime factor in 24! so if one of the factorials in the remaining three includes 23, but

---------------

 since the maximum factorial here is 5! (since the original number was 22, so the other numbers can be up to 22?

---------------

 Wait, actually, the other numbers can be up to 24, but since we are in case3 where one is

---------------

 22, but the others can be up to 24, but 23 is allowed?

Wait, actually

---------------

, in case3, if one of the numbers is 22, the other numbers can be anything from 1 to 24,

---------------

 as long as their factorials multiply to 24×23. But since 23 is a prime factor,

---------------

 one of the other factorials must include 23, which requires that number to be at least 23. But

---------------

 then, if one of them is 23, then we have 23! in the product. But then 

---------------

22! *23! * ... would be way too big. Hmm, so maybe this is impossible?

Wait, let

---------------

 me recast.

If one of the numbers is 22, then the remaining three factorials must multiply to (24!

---------------

)/(22!) =24×23×22! /22! =24×23=

---------------

552.

So the product of three factorials must equal 552. Let's see if that's possible.

Looking

---------------

 at 552's prime factors: 552=2^3 *3*23. The primes

---------------

 2,3,23.

Now, the factorials in the product can only contribute primes up to their own value

---------------

. Since 23 is a prime factor, one of the factorials must be at least 23. But 

---------------

23 is a factorial of 23!? Wait, 23 is a prime number, so 23!

---------------

 would include 23 as a factor, but 23! is way too big (23! is about 2.5e

---------------

22, but 552 is much smaller). So, the factorial that includes 23 must be exactly 23!

---------------

 but that's way too big. Wait, but 23 is a prime, so the only factorial that can include 23 as a factor is 23! or higher, but 

---------------

23! is way larger than 552. Therefore, it's impossible to have a factorial contributing 23 as

---------------

 a factor in this product, since even 23! is too big.

Therefore, the product of three factorials cannot

---------------

 include 23 as a prime factor unless one of them is 23 or higher, which would make the factorial too big. Therefore

---------------

, this case is impossible. So there are no quadruples where one of the numbers is 22.

Hmm, so

---------------

 case3 is impossible.

Case4: Maybe one of the numbers is 21? Let's see.

Then, 21! multiplied

---------------

 by the rest must equal 24!.

24! /21! =24×23×22×21! /21! =24×23×22=

---------------

24×506=12,144.

So the remaining three factorials must multiply to 12,144. Let

---------------

's factorize 12,144.

12,144 divided by 24 is 506, but

---------------

 let me do prime factors:

12,144: divide by 2: 6072

Again

---------------

 by 2: 3036

Again by 2: 1518

Again by 2: 759

7

---------------

59 divided by 3: 253

253 divided by 11: 23.

---------------

 So 253=11×23.

Therefore, 12,144=2^4 *

---------------

3 *11 *23.

Again, primes 2,3,11,23.

So, similar

---------------

 problem, we have primes like 23 again. To get 23 as a factor, we need a factorial that

---------------

 includes 23, which would have to be 23! or higher, but that would be way too big.

---------------

 23! is way larger than 12,144, so even if we have 23!,

---------------

 that would overshoot. So this case is also impossible.

Hmm, so maybe numbers less than 23 won't work because

---------------

 of the prime 23? Because 23 is a prime factor in 24! and so to have it

---------------

 in the product of the four factorials, one of them must include 23 as a factor, which requires that number

---------------

 to be at least 23. So the only way to get the 23 factor is to have either a 23 or 24 in the quadruple.

Similarly

---------------

, the prime 19, 17, 13 are also primes in 24!, so similar logic

---------------

 applies.

Therefore, to include primes like 23, 19, etc., we need at least one of the numbers to be at

---------------

 least 23, 19, etc. But since 23 is the largest prime in 24!, the

---------------

 only way to get 23 in the product is to have either 23 or 24 in the quadruple.

Wait

---------------

, so if there's a 24, then 24! includes all the primes up to 24, so that

---------------

's okay. If there's a 23, then 23! includes primes up to 23, which

---------------

 includes 19,17,13, etc. So, if there's a 23, then we

---------------

 need to account for the remaining primes. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the key is that either there is a 24,

---------------

 or there is a 23 and a 24's worth of other primes?

Hmm, maybe this is getting too convoluted. Let me try

---------------

 to structure the problem.

Let me think that the quadruple must contain either a 24 or a 23 (

---------------

or both? Wait, but if you have both 24 and 23, then their factorials would multiply to 

---------------

24! *23! which is way too big. So no, can't have both.

So the quadruple must contain exactly one of 24 or 23,

---------------

 or maybe neither, but as we saw earlier, primes like 23 require at least one of the factorials to include

---------------

 it, so you need at least one of the numbers to be at least 23. So you must have either 23 or 24.



---------------

Therefore, the quadruple must have either a 24 or a 23 (but not both). So there are two main cases: quadr

---------------

uples with a 24, and quadruples with a 23 but not a 24.

Wait, but in

---------------

 the case with a 23, do we need to account for the other primes?

Wait, let's consider first the

---------------

 case with 24:

Case1: Quadruple contains 24. Then, the remaining three numbers must have factorials multiplying to 1 (

---------------

since 24! *1*1*1=24!), so they must all be 1. So that

---------------

 gives 4 possibilities as before.

Case2: Quadruple contains 23 but not 24. Then, the

---------------

 product of the four factorials is 23! * a! * b! * c! =24!.

Therefore

---------------

, a! * b! * c! =24 / (23! /24!)? Wait, no,

---------------

 let me recast:

Wait, 24! =24 ×23!.

Therefore, if one of the numbers

---------------

 is 23, then the remaining three factorials must multiply to 24! /23! =24.

So

---------------

 the remaining three factorials must multiply to 24, which is 4!.

So the same as before. So as

---------------

 in case2 earlier, the three numbers must have factorials multiplying to 4!.

Which gives the same as before, 

---------------

6 ordered triples for each position of the 23, so total 4×6=24.

Wait, but in

---------------

 this case, the quadruple cannot contain a 24, so the 23 is present, and the rest are

---------------

 numbers whose factorials multiply to 24, but they can't be 24. Wait, but 24 is

---------------

 not a factorial except for 4!.

Wait, so when we considered the triples multiplying to 24, the numbers can

---------------

 be up to 4, since 4! is 24. So the other numbers can be 4,3,2,1 but

---------------

 not exceeding 4. Since 24 is excluded as a number (since we can't have 24 in this case).

---------------

 Wait, but 4 is allowed, since 4! is part of the product. So the numbers can be up to 4.

---------------

 So that is okay.

So in this case, the quadruple has one 23 and three numbers from 1 to

---------------

 4 such that their factorials multiply to 24. So that's valid.

Therefore, total cases so far:

---------------

 4 +24=28.

But are there other cases?

Wait, maybe there's a case where two of the numbers are 23 and

---------------

 something else?

Wait, but two 23s would mean 23! squared, which when multiplied by other factorials would be

---------------

 too large. Since 23! *23! is already (23!)^2, and 24! is only

---------------

 24×23!.

Thus, (23!)^2 is 23! *23! =

---------------

23! *24! /24, so that's way larger than 24!.

Therefore, we can't have two 23s.



---------------

Similarly, having both 24 and 23 would give 24! *23! *... which is way too big.



---------------

Alternatively, what about having a 22 and a 24? Let me see.

Wait, if one number is 24 and another is 22, then 

---------------

24! *22! * ... would already be 24! *22! which is way larger than 24!.

So

---------------

, no, that's too big.

Alternatively, maybe a case where neither 24 nor 23 is present,

---------------

 but then we need to include the prime 23, which is impossible because 23 is a prime factor in 24!.



---------------

Therefore, all quadruples must include either 24 or 23, but not both. So the only possibilities are the

---------------

 two cases above.

Wait, but let me check another possibility. Suppose there is a 23 and another number that is

---------------

 4, but arranged differently?

Wait, actually, in the second case where there is a 23, the remaining

---------------

 numbers can include a 4, but the total is already accounted for.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a case where we have two

---------------

 numbers contributing to the prime 23? But since 23 is prime, it can only come from one factorial.

---------------

 So only one of the factorials can include 23, so only one number can be 23 or higher. Since

---------------

 24 is higher, but we already considered cases with 24 and 23.

Therefore, the only possibilities

---------------

 are either a 24 with the rest 1s, or a 23 with three numbers whose factorials multiply to 24,

---------------

 which are the cases we considered.

Wait, but let's see if there are other cases where the quadruple has neither 24 nor 23 but

---------------

 still includes 23 via some factorial? But since 23 is prime, the only factorial that includes it is 23! or higher, so you

---------------

 have to have at least 23. So that can't be. Hence, indeed, only the two cases.

Wait

---------------

, but hold on, let's check another prime, like 19. Suppose the quadruple has a 19,

---------------

 but not 23 or 24. Then 19! would include 19 as a factor, but then

---------------

 23 would still need to be included, which can't happen. So no, that's invalid.

Therefore, the

---------------

 only valid quadruples are the ones in the two cases. Therefore total 4 +24=28.

But wait, hold

---------------

 on a second. Let me see if there are more possibilities in case2 where we have a 23 and three numbers whose factorials multiply to 24.



---------------

Earlier, I considered that the three numbers must have factorials multiplying to 4! =24, so the numbers can

---------------

 be (4,1,1) or (3,2,2). But perhaps there are other combinations?

Wait, let's see

---------------

: 24 can also be expressed as 2! *3! *4! / something? Wait, no,

---------------

 need three factorials.

Wait, 2! * 2! * 6, but 6 is 3!.

Wait, 

---------------

2! * 2! *3! =2*2*6=24. That's already considered as (3,2,2)

---------------

 when considering the numbers 3,2,2.

Alternatively, 1! *4! *1! is (4,1,1). Are

---------------

 there any others?

Let me list all possible triples (a,b,c) where a!b!c! =24.



---------------

Possible factorials: 1!,2!,3!,4!.

Let me list all possible combinations:

First, using 4!:

4

---------------

! *1! *1! =24*1*1=24. So (4,1,1).



---------------

Second, without using 4!:

Looking for three factorials (each ≤3!) whose product is 24.

3! is 6. So

---------------

 6 * something.

If we take two 3!'s: 6*6=36, too big.

One

---------------

 3! and two 2!'s: 6*2*2=24. So (3,2,2).

Alternatively

---------------

, three 2!'s: 2*2*2=8, nope.

One 3!, one 2!, one 1!: 6*2*1=12, no

---------------

pe.

Four 2!'s but only three numbers.

Alternatively, using 1!'s:

If we have a 3! and the

---------------

 rest 1!'s: 6*1*1=6, too small.

Alternatively, 2!*2!*6

---------------

, but 6 is 3!.

Thus, the only possibilities are indeed (4,1,1) and (3,2,2). So only

---------------

 two unordered triples, which give 3+3=6 ordered triples each as before.

So case2 is correctly accounted for.



---------------

Wait, but another thought: What if one of the numbers is 5? Because 5! is 120, which is bigger than 24, but in

---------------

 case2, the remaining three numbers have to multiply to 24, so they can't be 5 or higher.

---------------

 Because 5! is 120 which is bigger than 24, so their factorials can't contribute to

---------------

 the product 24. So the numbers in the remaining three must be at most 4, so that's okay.

Therefore

---------------

, the earlier analysis holds.

Wait, but what about the case where we have two numbers at 23 and one 

---------------

1 and one something? But we saw that two 23s would make the product too big.

Alternatively, perhaps there

---------------

's a case with a 24 and another number?

Wait, suppose one number is 24 and another is 

---------------

4, then the remaining two would need to be 1!.

But that would be 24! *4! *1! *1!.

But 

---------------

24! *4! is way bigger than 24!.

Wait, no. Wait, the total product has to be exactly 24!.

If

---------------

 you have 24! multiplied by anything else except 1!, it would exceed 24!.

Therefore, in case1, the

---------------

 only way is to have 24 and three 1!'s.

Therefore, case1 is only 4 quadruples.

Similarly

---------------

, in case2, the 23 must be accompanied by three numbers whose factorials multiply to 24, but

---------------

 not introducing any other large factorials.

Therefore, total is 4 +24=28.

But hold on, before

---------------

 I conclude, let me check another angle. Let's think of the exponents of the primes in 24!.

For

---------------

 example, let's take the prime 23. Its exponent in 24! is 1. So in the product a!b!c!d!, the total

---------------

 exponent of 23 must be 1.

The exponent of 23 in a factorial is 1 if the number is ≥23, and

---------------

 0 otherwise. So exactly one of the numbers a,b,c,d must be ≥23, because 23's

---------------

 exponent is 1. Since 23 and 24 are the only numbers ≥23 (since they are positive integers).

---------------

 So exactly one of the four numbers must be 23 or 24, and the others must be ≤22.



---------------

Therefore, this gives two possibilities for that one number: either 23 or 24. Therefore, the total number of quadruples is the

---------------

 number of quadruples with exactly one 24 and the rest ≤23 (but actually, the rest must be 1 as

---------------

 in case1) plus the number with exactly one 23 and the rest ≤22 (but arranged so that their factorials multiply appropriately

---------------

).

Wait, but according to the prime exponent logic, since the exponent of 23 is 1, exactly one of the numbers

---------------

 must be ≥23, so either 23 or 24, and the rest must be ≤22.

---------------

 However, if the number is 24, then the rest can be anything ≤24, but their factorials multiplied

---------------

 by 24! must equal 24! so they have to be 1! each. So that's case

---------------

1.

If the number is 23, then the remaining three numbers must be ≤22, and their factorials multiplied

---------------

 by 23! must equal 24!.

Which requires that the remaining three factorials multiply to 24,

---------------

 as before, so they can be up to 4, since 4! is 24. So the remaining numbers can

---------------

 be 1,2,3,4. So that's case2.

Therefore, the total is indeed 4 +24=28.

Wait, but let

---------------

 me think again of another prime, say 19. The exponent of 19 in 24! is 1. So in

---------------

 the product, the total exponent of 19 must be 1. The exponent of 19 in a factorial is 1 if the number is ≥19 and <20 (

---------------

i.e., 19,20,...24) or 0 otherwise. Wait, actually, the exponent of 19 in n! is floor(n/19). Since

---------------

 19 divides 19, 20,...,24, so floor(n/19) is 1 for n≥19.

---------------

 So if any of the numbers is ≥19, then their factorial will have at least one 19. But since the total exponent must

---------------

 be 1, only one of the numbers can be ≥19, and the others must be <19.

But

---------------

 in our cases:

Case1: One number is 24 (which is ≥19), so the other three numbers

---------------

 must be ≤18 to not contribute to the exponent of 19. However, in case1, the other three numbers are 1, which are ≤18, so that's okay.

Case2: One number is 23 (which is ≥19), so the other three numbers must be ≤18.

---------------

 But in case2, the other numbers can be up to 4, which is ≤18, so that's okay.

Therefore

---------------

, this condition is satisfied in both cases.

Similarly for prime 17: exponent is 1. So similar reasoning:

---------------

 only one number can be ≥17. Since in case1, the 24 is ≥17, and others are 1,

---------------

 so okay. In case2, the 23 is ≥17, and others are ≤4, so okay.

Same for primes

---------------

 13, 11, etc.

Therefore, the two cases are valid and there are no other cases.

Therefore

---------------

, the total number of quadruples is 4 +24=28.

Wait, but let me check another angle

---------------

. Let me see if there are other possibilities where the prime exponents could add up.

Take the prime 2, which

---------------

 has exponent 22 in 24!.

Suppose in case2 where we have a 23 and three numbers (

---------------

say x,y,z) with factorials multiplying to 24. Let me see the exponent of 2 in 23! plus

---------------

 the exponents in x!, y!, z! must equal 22.

The exponent of 2 in 23! is floor

---------------

(23/2)+floor(23/4)+floor(23/8)+floor(23/16)+

---------------

floor(23/32)=11+5+2+1+0=19.

Then, the remaining

---------------

 three factorials must contribute 22-19=3 exponents of 2.

The remaining three numbers (x,y,z) have

---------------

 factorials whose exponents of 2 must add up to 3.

Let me check for the triples in case2:

First possibility

---------------

: (4,1,1). The exponents of 2 in 4! is 3 (since 4! has 2^3). The

---------------

 exponents in 1! are 0. So total is 3+0+0=3. That works.

Second possibility: (3,2,2). The exponent in 3! is floor(3/2)+floor(3/4)=1+0=1.

---------------

 Wait, no, exponent of 2 in 3! is calculated as:

Wait, exponent of prime p in n! is sum_{k=1}^∞ floor(n/p^k).

---------------

 For prime 2 in 3!:

floor(3/2)=1, floor(3/4)=0. So total exponent 1.

Similarly

---------------

, exponent of 2 in 2! is 1 (floor(2/2)=1). So for (3,2,2), the

---------------

 exponents are 1 (from 3!) +1 (from first 2!) +1 (from second 2!) = total

---------------

 3. Perfect, that adds to 3. So that works.

Therefore, the exponents for prime 2 check

---------------

 out.

Similarly, check another prime, say 3.

In case2, exponent of 3 in 23! is floor(23/3)+floor(23/9)+floor(23/27)=7+2+0=9.

Total

---------------

 exponent of 3 in 24! is 10, so remaining three factorials must contribute 1.

First

---------------

 case (4,1,1):

Exponent of 3 in 4! is floor(4/3)+floor(4/9)=1+0=1. The others

---------------

 are 0. Total 1. Good.

Second case (3,2,2):

Exponent of 3 in 3! is 1 (floor(3/3)=1). The 

---------------

2!s have 0. Total 1. Good.

Thus exponents of 3 work.

Similarly, prime 5:



---------------

In case2, 23! has exponent of 5: floor(23/5)+floor(23/25)=4+0=4. The

---------------

 total in 24! is 4, so remaining must contribute 0. The remaining numbers are up to 4, so their factorials don

---------------

't have 5 as a factor. So okay.

Prime 7:

23! has exponent floor(23/7)+floor(23/49)=3+0=3. 

---------------

24! has exponent 3, so remaining contribute 0. The remaining numbers are ≤4, so okay.

Similarly

---------------

, primes 11,13,17,19,23:

In case2, the 23! already

---------------

 includes all these primes (except 23 is exactly once). The remaining numbers are ≤4, so they don't contribute to

---------------

 these primes. So exponents match.

Therefore, all primes are accounted for.

Therefore, case2 is valid, and the

---------------

 total is indeed 28.

Wait, but I just thought of something else. In case2, when we have the

---------------

 three numbers whose factorials multiply to 24, perhaps there are more possibilities if considering different orderings?

Wait, no

---------------

. We considered ordered triples. For example, for the (4,1,1), there are 3 permutations, and for (3,2,2), there are 3 permutations. So when

---------------

 we multiplied by 4 positions for the 23, that should be correct.

Alternatively, let me think of an explicit example.



---------------

Take the quadruple (23,4,1,1). This is one quadruple where the 23 is first, then

---------------

 4,1,1.

Another is (23,1,4,1), etc. So for each of

---------------

 the 4 positions of 23, the remaining three can be arranged in 3 ways for the 4 case and 3 ways for the 3,2,2 case. So

---------------

 total 6 per 23 position, so 4×6=24. That seems right.

Therefore, I

---------------

 think the total number is 28. Hmm.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says "ordered quadruples", so different

---------------

 orderings count as different even if they have the same numbers. So in case1, where you have (24,1,1,1), the

---------------

 24 can be in any of the four positions, so 4 quadruples. That's straightforward.

In case2, for

---------------

 each position of the 23, the remaining three numbers can be arranged in different ways. For example, suppose 23 is in the first position. Then the remaining

---------------

 three numbers can be (4,1,1) in any order, so 3 permutations (the 4 can be in positions

---------------

 2,3, or 4). Similarly, the (3,2,2) can be arranged in 3 ways (the 3 can be in any of the three positions). So 

---------------

3+3=6 for each position of 23, so 4×6=24.

Therefore, adding

---------------

 case1 and case2 gives 4+24=28.

Therefore, the answer is 28. Wait

---------------

, but let me check once more for any oversight.

Is there a case where two of the numbers are 23? Let

---------------

 me see. Suppose two 23s. Then the product would be 23! *23! *a

---------------

! *b!.

But 23! *23! is way larger than 24! since 23! *

---------------

23! = (23!)^2 and 24! =24*23!.

So (23!)^2 /

---------------

24! =23! /24, which is an integer? 23! divided by 24 is 23!/(24)= (23)!/(24)= (23×22!)/ (24)= (23×22!)/(24). Since

---------------

 24=4×6, but 22! includes factors up to 22, so 24 divides 22!? Wait

---------------

 24=2^3*3. 22! has plenty of 2s and 3s, so yes, 23! divided

---------------

 by24 is integer. However, the product would then be 23! *23! *a! *b! =24! =>

---------------

 23! *a! *b! =24!/23! =24.

Therefore, the remaining two factorials must

---------------

 multiply to 24/(23! /23! ?) Wait, no, let me re-express:

Wait, if

---------------

 two of the numbers are 23, then:

Total product is 23!^2 *a! *b! =24!.

So

---------------

 a! *b! =24!/(23!^2)= (24×23!)/(23!×

---------------

23!)=24/(23!).

Wait, 24/(23!)? That's a fraction. So

---------------

 that can't be, since a! and b! are integers. Therefore, this is impossible.

Therefore, two 23s are

---------------

 impossible. So no such quadruples.

Similarly, having a 23 and a 24 would give 23! *24! * ...

---------------

 which is way too big. So that's invalid.

Therefore, the only cases are the two considered, totaling 28.

Wait

---------------

, but hold on. Let me think of another prime, say 7. In case2, the exponent of 7 in 23! is 3, which

---------------

 matches the exponent in 24!.

The remaining three numbers (up to 4) don't contribute any 7s, so that's okay.

Hmm

---------------

, everything seems okay.

Alternatively, let me think of an explicit example of a quadruple in case2:

(23,4,1,1).

---------------

 This works because 23! *4! *1! *1! =23! *24 =24!.

Yes

---------------

, that works.

Another example: (23,3,2,2). 23! *6 *2*2=23! *24=24!.

Also

---------------

 works.

Another one: (1,23,2,3). The order doesn't matter except for counting ordered quadruples.

---------------

 So each permutation is counted separately.

Therefore, I think the answer is 28. But I need to be 100% sure.

---------------

 Wait, but let me see if there are other factorizations for the remaining three numbers.

Wait, suppose the three numbers are

---------------

 (2,3,4). Then their factorials multiply to 2! *3! *4! =2*6*24=288, which is more

---------------

 than 24. Not good.

Alternatively, (2,2,3). 2!*2!*3! =2*2*6=24. Wait

---------------

, hold on! Wait, that's the same as (3,2,2). So that's already counted.

Alternatively

---------------

, (2,4,1): 2! *4! *1! =2*24*1=48,

---------------

 which is more than 24. Not okay.

Alternatively, (3,1,4): same as (4,3,1),

---------------

 which is part of the (4,1,1) case? No, wait, (3,1,4) would

---------------

 be 6*1*24=144, which is too big. Wait, no, hold on.

---------------

 Wait, if the numbers are (3,1,4), then their factorials multiply to 3! *1! *4! =6*1*24=144.

---------------

 Not 24. So that's invalid. So only the two cases where the product is exactly 24.

Therefore

---------------

, yes, only the two unordered triples. So I think 28 is correct.

Therefore, the answer is 28.

---------------

 So I should write:

Answer: 28

Wait, but wait, I just thought of something. The problem says "ordered quadruples of positive integers (a, b, c, d)". In case2, when we

---------------

 have the 23 in one position and then the three numbers which can be arranged in 6 ways, but are we

---------------

 overcounting?

Wait, let's take an example where the three numbers are (4,1,1). The number

---------------

 of ordered triples here is 3 (since the 4 can be in any of the three positions). Similarly, for (3,2,2), the 3 can be in any of the three positions, so 

---------------

3 ordered triples.

Therefore, for each position of the 23 (4 positions), we have 3+3=6 ordered triples for

---------------

 the remaining three numbers. So 4×6=24. That is correct.

Therefore, total is 28. I

---------------

 think that is correct. Therefore, the answer should be 28.

But wait, let me check an online resource or think

---------------

 if there's another possible case.

Wait, let me think if there is a case with a 24 and another number besides

---------------

 1's. Suppose we have (24, 1,1,1) as case1. But suppose someone

---------------

 says, can we have (24, 2,1,1) ?

Then the product would be 24! *2! *1! *1! =24! *2 which is double

---------------

 24!, so that's too big. So no, that's invalid. So you can't have anything else except

---------------

 1's with the 24.

Similarly, if you have (24, 1,1,2), same problem

---------------

.

Therefore, case1 is only 4.

Therefore, yes, I think 28 is correct.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{28}


To solve the problem of finding the number of ordered quadruples of positive integers \((a, b, c, d)\) such that \(a! \cdot b! \cdot c! \cdot d! = 24!\), we consider

---------------

 the prime factorization of \(24!\) and analyze the possible cases for the values of \(a, b, c, d\).

### Key Steps:

1. **Prime Factorization of \(24!\)**:
   - The prime factors of \(24!\) include primes up to 23.

---------------

 The exponents of these primes in \(24!\) are calculated as follows:
     - \(2^{22} \cdot 3^{10} \cdot 5^4 \cdot 7^3 \cdot 11^2 \cdot 13^1 \cdot 17^1 \cdot 19^1 \cdot 23^1\).

2. **Cases

---------------

 Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: One of the numbers is \(24\). The remaining three numbers must be \(1\) since

---------------

 \(24! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! = 24!\). There are \(4\) such quadruples (each position can be \(24\)).
   - **Case 2**: One of the numbers is \(23\). The remaining three numbers must multiply

---------------

 their factorials to \(24\) (since \(24! / 23! = 24\)). The valid

---------------

 triples (considering factorials) are:
     - \((4!, 1!, 1!)\) leading to \(

---------------

3\) permutations for each position of \(4\).
     - \((3!, 2!, 2!)\) leading to \(3\) permutations for each position of \(3\).
     - For

---------------

 each position of \(23\), there are \(3 + 3 = 6\) permutations. Thus, \(4 \times 6 = 24\) quadruples.

3. **Verification

---------------

**:
   - The prime exponents (especially primes like \(23\), \(19\), etc.) are

---------------

 checked to ensure they sum correctly in both cases.
   - Other cases (e.g., including \(22\) or more

---------------

 than one \(23\)) are invalid due to exceeding the prime exponents or factorial values.

### Conclusion:
The total number of ordered quadruples is the sum of the valid cases:
- Case 1: \(4\)
- Case 2: \(24\)

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{28}\).<|im_end|>
