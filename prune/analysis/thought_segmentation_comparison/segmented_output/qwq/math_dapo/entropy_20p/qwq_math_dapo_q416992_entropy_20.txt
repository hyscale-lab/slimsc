Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. We have 36 objects arranged in a circle, each equally spaced. We need to find the number of ways to choose 3 objects such that no two chosen objects

---------------

 are adjacent or diametrically opposite. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.

First, let's recall that when dealing with circular arrangements, sometimes

---------------

 it's helpful to fix one point and consider the rest relative to it, but I'm not sure yet. Let's start

---------------

 by calculating the total number of ways to choose any 3 objects out of 36 without any restrictions. That should be straightforward.

---------------

 The combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), so here it would be C(36, 3). Let me compute that:



---------------

C(36, 3) = 36 * 35 * 34 / (3 * 2 * 1) = (36*35*34)/6. Let me compute

---------------

 that step by step. 36 divided by 6 is 6, so 6 * 35 * 34. 35*34 is 1190, so 6*1190 = 7140. Wait, actually

---------------

, let me check that again. 36*35 is 1260, 1260*34.

---------------

 Hmm, maybe I should compute it properly:

36 * 35 = 1260, 1260 * 34 =

---------------

 let's see, 1260*30 = 37,800 and 1260*4=5,040, so total is 37,800 +5,040 = 42,840. Then divide by 6: 42,840 /6 = 7,140. Yeah

---------------

, so total is 7,140. Got that.

Now, the problem says we have to exclude the cases where any two of the chosen objects are adjacent or diametrically opposite. So

---------------

 we need to subtract all the triplets that have at least one pair adjacent or diametrically opposite. But we have to be careful with

---------------

 overlapping cases where a triplet might have both an adjacent pair and a diametrically opposite pair, so inclusion-exclusion principle might

---------------

 be needed here.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute the total number of valid triplets directly by considering the restrictions. Let

---------------

 me think. Hmm, perhaps inclusion-exclusion is the way to go here. Let's see.

First, let's define

---------------

 the forbidden conditions:

1. Any two of the three chosen objects are adjacent.

2. Any two of the three chosen objects are diametrically opposite.

We

---------------

 need to count all triplets that don't have either of these. So, the total valid is total triplets minus those

---------------

 that have at least one forbidden pair.

Alternatively, we can compute it as:

Total = C(36,3) - [number of triplets with at least one adjacent pair + number of triplets with at least one diametrically opposite pair] + [number of triplets with both an adjacent pair and a diametrically opposite pair].

---------------

 

Wait, right, because when we subtract both the adjacent and the diametrically opposite cases, we might have subtracted too

---------------

 much where a triplet has both an adjacent pair and a diametrically opposite pair. So we need to add those back in. So

---------------

 inclusion-exclusion formula.

So the formula is:

Valid = Total - (A + D) + (A ∩ D),

where A is the number of triplets with at least one adjacent pair, D is the number with at least one diametrically opposite pair, and A ∩ D is the number with both.

Therefore

---------------

, I need to compute A, D, and A ∩ D.

Let me compute each term step by step.

First, compute

---------------

 A: the number of triplets with at least one adjacent pair.

To compute A: How many triplets have at least one adjacent pair.

---------------

 Since the objects are arranged in a circle, each pair of adjacent objects can form part of such a triplet. Let's think

---------------

 of it this way: For each adjacent pair, how many triplets can be formed by adding a third object that is not part of the pair?

---------------

 But then, this might overcount because a triplet can have two adjacent pairs (like three consecutive objects). Hmm, so maybe

---------------

 we need to use inclusion-exclusion here too. Wait, perhaps another approach is better.

Alternatively, the number of triplets with at least one adjacent pair can be calculated as follows

---------------

:

First, count the number of adjacent pairs. In a circle of 36 objects, each object has two neighbors, so there are 36 adjacent pairs.

---------------

 Each adjacent pair can be considered as a single unit. To form a triplet with this pair, we need to choose a third object not

---------------

 adjacent to either end of the pair? Wait no, actually, any third object not part of the pair. Wait, but if

---------------

 we just take any third object, then the triplet will include the adjacent pair plus another object. However, the problem is that if

---------------

 the third object is adjacent to one of the pair's endpoints, then the triplet could form another adjacent pair, but that's okay because

---------------

 we are counting all triplets with at least one adjacent pair.

Wait, actually, maybe a better approach is:

The number of triplets with at least one adjacent pair is equal to the

---------------

 number of adjacent pairs multiplied by (n - 4). Wait, why? Let me think again.

Suppose we fix an adjacent pair,

---------------

 say between positions 1 and 2. Then the third object can be any of the remaining 34 objects (since total

---------------

 is 36, minus the two in the pair). However, but if the third object is adjacent to either 1 or 2, then

---------------

 we might be forming another adjacent pair. But in this approach, we are counting all triplets that include the original adjacent pair,

---------------

 regardless of the third element. However, this counts each triplet with two adjacent pairs multiple times. For example, a triplet with

---------------

 three consecutive objects (like 1,2,3) would be counted once for the pair (1,2) and once for the pair (2,3). So

---------------

 we need to adjust for overcounting.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Number of triplets with at least one adjacent pair = (number of adjacent pairs) * (n

---------------

 - 2) - (number of triplets with two adjacent pairs). Hmm, but this seems recursive.

Alternatively, let

---------------

 me recall that for a circle, the number of ways to choose 3 objects with at least one adjacent pair is equal to n*(n - 4). Wait, maybe

---------------

 not exactly. Let me see.

Alternatively, here's a standard formula for circular arrangements:

The number of ways to choose k objects with

---------------

 no two adjacent is C(n - k, k) + C(n - k -1, k -1). But that

---------------

's for no two adjacent. But here we want at least one adjacent. Hmm, maybe better to compute total minus the number

---------------

 with no two adjacent.

Wait, perhaps that's a better approach. Let me think again.

Total triplets: C(36,3)

---------------

 = 7140.

Number of triplets with no two adjacent: ?

If I can compute that, then A

---------------

 = total - no two adjacent.

Wait, actually, since we need the number of triplets with at least one adjacent pair, then

---------------

 A = Total - (number of triplets with no two adjacent). So maybe that's easier.

Similarly for diametrically opposite.



---------------

Wait, perhaps this approach is better. Let me try that.

First, compute the number of triplets with no two adjacent and

---------------

 no two diametrically opposite, but that might be complicated. Wait, no, actually, the problem requires that both conditions are satisfied: no two are adjacent AND no two are diametrically opposite. So

---------------

 perhaps the inclusion-exclusion approach is better.

Alternatively, let me first compute A (number of triplets with at least one adjacent pair)

---------------

 using the total minus the non-adjacent triplets.

So first, compute the number of triplets with no two adjacent.

---------------

 Let me recall that for circular arrangements, the formula for the number of ways to choose k non-consecutive objects is C(n - k, k) + C(n - k -1, k -1). Wait, but

---------------

 I might need to verify this.

Alternatively, here's a method. Let's fix one object, say object 1. To

---------------

 avoid adjacency, the next object can't be 2 or 36. Hmm, this might get complicated.

Alternatively, here

---------------

's a standard approach for circular non-adjacent selections:

The number of ways to choose k non-consecutive objects from n arranged in a circle is C

---------------

(n - k, k) + C(n - k -1, k -1). Let me check for small n and

---------------

 k.

Suppose n=5, k=2. Then the number of ways should be 5 (each pair is

---------------

 two apart, but in a circle of 5, choosing two non-adjacent would actually be 5, since each is

---------------

 opposite? Wait, no, in a pentagon, two vertices are adjacent or separated by one vertex. Wait, actually,

---------------

 in a 5-gon, two non-adjacent vertices are those with one vertex between them. So the number of such

---------------

 pairs is 5. Using the formula: C(5-2,2) + C(5-2-1, 

---------------

2-1) = C(3,2) + C(2,1)=3 +2=5. That

---------------

 works. So formula is correct.

So, for n=36, k=3, the number of triplets with no two adjacent is C(36 -3,3) + C(36 -3 -1,3-1) = C(33,3) + C(32,2).

Wait

---------------

 let's compute that.

C(33,3) = (33×32×31)/(3×2×1) = (33×32×31)/6. Let me compute 

---------------

33×32=1056, then 1056×31. 1056×30=31,680 and

---------------

 1056×1=1,056, so total 32,736. Div

---------------

ided by 6: 32,736 /6 = 5,456.

Then C(32,2) is (32×31)/2 = 496.

Therefore

---------------

 total non-adjacent triplets: 5,456 + 496 = 5,952.

Wait

---------------

, so A = total triplets - non-adjacent triplets = 7,140 - 5,952 = 1,188. Hmm

---------------

, so that's the number of triplets with at least one adjacent pair. Okay, that's A.

Now, moving on to D, which is the number of triplets with at least one diametrically opposite pair.

Hmm

---------------

, so first, how many diametrically opposite pairs are there in 36 objects?

Since it's a circle with 36 objects, each object has exactly one diametrically opposite object. Since

---------------

 36 is even, the number of diametrically opposite pairs is 36/2 = 18.

---------------

 So there are 18 such pairs.

Each diametrically opposite pair can form a triplet by adding any third object not

---------------

 in the pair. Wait, but again, similar to the adjacent case, we have to be careful about overcounting.



---------------

Wait, the number of triplets with at least one diametrically opposite pair can be calculated as:

Number of diametrically opposite pairs ×

---------------

 (number of remaining objects) - but subtract overlaps where a triplet has two diametrically opposite pairs? Hmm, but in

---------------

 a triplet, can there be two diametrically opposite pairs?

Suppose we have three objects, A, B, C. If A and B are diametrically opposite, and also

---------------

 B and C are diametrically opposite, then A and C would have to be the same as each other, which is

---------------

 impossible unless the circle has only two points. Since 36 is even but not 2, so each object has only

---------------

 one diametrically opposite. Therefore, a triplet cannot have two diametrically opposite pairs, because that would require three objects

---------------

 where two are opposite each of the other two, which would force all three to be in a line? Wait, maybe not

---------------

. Let me think.

Suppose you have three objects: A, B, and C. Suppose A is opposite B, and B is opposite C. Then A

---------------

 must be the same as C, which can't happen. Similarly, if A is opposite B and A is opposite C, then B and C would

---------------

 have to be the same. So, in a triplet, there can be at most one diametrically opposite pair. Therefore

---------------

, there is no overlap where a triplet has two such pairs. Therefore, the count is straightforward.

Therefore, the number of triplets with at least one diametrically opposite pair is simply

---------------

 the number of diametrically opposite pairs multiplied by (36 - 2), since for each such pair, we can choose any third object (

---------------

excluding the two in the pair). However, wait, but in this case, if the third object is adjacent to either of the pair?

---------------

 Wait, no, the problem only restricts that in the final count, but here we are just counting all triplets that include a

---------------

 diametrically opposite pair, regardless of other adjacencies. So the count is indeed 18 * 34.

---------------

 Wait, because for each of the 18 diametrically opposite pairs, we can choose any of the remaining 34 objects.

---------------

 So 18*34 = 612. But hold on, but wait, is this overcounting?



---------------

Wait, suppose a triplet has two diametrically opposite pairs. But as we saw, that's impossible, so each triplet is

---------------

 counted at most once. Hence, yes, it's 18 * 34 = 612. Therefore

---------------

 D=612.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. Suppose a triplet has a diametrically opposite pair and another

---------------

 pair that is also diametrically opposite? But that would require three objects where two are opposite each other, and another two are opposite each other, but as

---------------

 I thought before, that's impossible unless they are the same, so no such triplets. So D is indeed 18*

---------------

34 = 612.

Hmm, but let me verify with an example. Suppose we have objects 1 and 19 (

---------------

since 1+18=19, so diametrically opposite). Then if we pick another object, say 2, then

---------------

 the triplet (1,19,2) has the diametrically opposite pair (1,19). If another

---------------

 triplet (1,19,38) but 38 mod 36 is 2, so same as above

---------------

. Wait, but in any case, each triplet with a diametrically opposite pair is counted exactly once. So D is

---------------

 18*34 = 612. Okay.

Now, moving on to A ∩ D, the number of triplets that have at least one adjacent pair AND at least one diametrically opposite pair.

This

---------------

 is the overlap between A and D. So these are triplets where one pair is adjacent and another pair (or the same pair

---------------

?) is diametrically opposite. Wait, but a pair can't be both adjacent and diametrically opposite unless the circle has only

---------------

 4 objects, right? Since in 36 objects, the distance between adjacent is 1, and diametrically opposite is 18 apart. So adjacent

---------------

 pairs are distance 1, diametrically opposite are distance 18. So they can't overlap. So in a

---------------

 triplet, an adjacent pair and a diametrically opposite pair must be two different pairs. So, the triplet must have both

---------------

 an adjacent pair and a diametrically opposite pair. Let me think of how this can happen.

Suppose we have three objects: A, B, and C. Let’s say A and B are adjacent, and A

---------------

 and C are diametrically opposite. Then, B and C would be separated by (distance from A to C is 18, so

---------------

 B is next to A, so the distance from B to C would be 17 or 19, depending on direction.

---------------

 Not diametrically opposite. So in this case, the triplet has one adjacent pair (A,B) and one diametrically opposite pair (A,C). Similarly

---------------

, the triplet could have another configuration where B and C are adjacent and A and C are opposite, etc.

Alternatively, the

---------------

 triplet could have two different pairs: one adjacent and one diametrically opposite. Let me think of how to count these.

First

---------------

, let's consider that in such a triplet, there must be an adjacent pair and a diametrically opposite pair. Since

---------------

 the adjacent pair and the diametrically opposite pair must share a common element or not? Let's see.

Case 1: The adjacent

---------------

 pair and the diametrically opposite pair share a common element. For example, A-B adjacent and A-C opposite. So

---------------

 the triplet is A,B,C where A-B are adjacent, and A-C are opposite.

Case 2: The adjacent pair and diametrically opposite pair are disjoint. So

---------------

 the triplet has three elements where two are adjacent (say A-B) and two others (A-C) are opposite, but that

---------------

 would require a fourth element, which isn't possible here. Wait, in a triplet, if the adjacent pair is A-B and the diametrically opposite pair is C-D, but since

---------------

 it's a triplet, there are only three elements. So the diametrically opposite pair must include one of the adjacent pair.

---------------

 Therefore, the two pairs must share a common element.

Therefore, all triplets in A ∩ D must have one adjacent

---------------

 pair and one diametrically opposite pair that share a common element. So the triplet is structured as A, B, C where A and B are adjacent, and A and C are diametrically opposite.

---------------

 Alternatively, A and B adjacent, and B and C are diametrically opposite. So two possibilities for each such triplet.

Therefore

---------------

, to count A ∩ D, we can consider all such triplets where there is an adjacent pair and a diametrically opposite pair sharing

---------------

 one element.

Let me formalize this:

Let’s consider each adjacent pair. For each adjacent pair (A, B), we

---------------

 can look for a third point C such that either A and C are diametrically opposite, or B and C are diametrically opposite.

So

---------------

 for each adjacent pair (A,B):

- The diametrically opposite point of A is A_opposite, and the diametrically opposite of B is B_opposite.

Therefore

---------------

, the third point C can be either A_opposite or B_opposite.

However, we have to ensure that C is not already

---------------

 in the pair (A,B). Since A_opposite is different from A and B (since the distance between A and A

---------------

_opposite is 18, while adjacent is 1). Similarly, B_opposite is not adjacent to B except in

---------------

 a circle of 4, which isn't our case. Therefore, for each adjacent pair (A,B), there are two possible C

---------------

's: A_opposite and B_opposite. Thus, each adjacent pair contributes two triplets to A ∩ D.

However

---------------

, we must be careful not to double count. Let me see.

Each triplet in A ∩ D is counted once for each adjacent pair that

---------------

 it contains. Wait, but if a triplet has two adjacent pairs, which is possible (like three consecutive objects), then it

---------------

 would be counted for each adjacent pair. However, in our current approach, for each adjacent pair (A,B), we add

---------------

 two triplets (with C as A_opposite or B_opposite). So if a triplet has two adjacent pairs, say

---------------

 (A,B) and (B,C), then when considering the pair (A,B), we might have added C as A

---------------

_opposite or B_opposite, but if the triplet is (A,B,C) where, say, A and C are opposite, then it

---------------

's counted once here. However, the pair (B,C) would also be considered, and if, say, B and some

---------------

 other point is opposite, but unless C is B's opposite, which would require that. Hmm, perhaps it's manageable.



---------------

Wait, let me think again. Let me first compute the total number contributed by each adjacent pair.

There are 36 adjacent pairs.

---------------

 Each contributes 2 triplets (adding A_opposite or B_opposite). So total would be 36 * 2 = 72. But this

---------------

 counts each triplet in A ∩ D exactly how many times?

Suppose a triplet has an adjacent pair and a diametrically opposite pair. Let

---------------

's see: The triplet has an adjacent pair, say (A,B), and a diametrically opposite pair (A,C). Then

---------------

 this triplet is counted when considering the adjacent pair (A,B), with C=A_opposite. Similarly, it could also be counted if

---------------

 there's another adjacent pair in the triplet. For example, if the triplet is (A,B,C), where A and B are adjacent, and B

---------------

 and C are adjacent (so three in a row), and also, say, A and D are opposite, but that might

---------------

 not be part of the triplet. Wait, no, in this case, the triplet (A,B,C) would only have the

---------------

 diametrically opposite pair if, say, A and C are opposite? Let me think.

Wait, let's take a concrete example. Suppose the

---------------

 triplet is (A, B, A_opposite). Here, A and B are adjacent, and A and A_opposite are diametrically opposite. So

---------------

 this triplet is counted once when we look at the adjacent pair (A,B) and add A_opposite. It is also counted

---------------

 when considering the adjacent pair (B, A_opposite)? Wait, but B and A_opposite are not adjacent. The

---------------

 distance between B and A_opposite would be (distance from A to A_opposite is 18, so from B to

---------------

 A_opposite is 17 or 19, depending on direction). Since the circle has 36 objects, moving

---------------

 from B in one direction, the distance to A_opposite is 18 -1 =17. So not adjacent. Therefore

---------------

, the triplet is only counted once, via the adjacent pair (A,B).

Another example: suppose the triplet is (A, B, B_opposite). Here

---------------

, the adjacent pair is (A,B), and the diametrically opposite pair is (B, B_opposite). So

---------------

 this triplet is counted when considering the adjacent pair (A,B) and adding B_opposite. Also, if there is another adjacent pair in

---------------

 the triplet, but in this case, only (A,B) is adjacent, so only counted once.

Therefore, each triplet in A ∩ D is counted exactly once for

---------------

 each adjacent pair that it contains. However, a triplet can have more than one adjacent pair. For instance, if the triplet has three consecutive objects,

---------------

 like (A, B, C) where A-B and B-C are adjacent. Then, such a triplet would have two adjacent pairs. However

---------------

, unless one of those pairs also forms a diametrically opposite pair with the third object, which would require that either A and C are diametrically opposite (

---------------

distance 18 apart). Since they are two apart, that would only happen if 2 ≡ 18 mod 36, which is

---------------

 not true. So in such a triplet of three consecutive objects, there is no diametrically opposite pair, so they are

---------------

 not part of A ∩ D.

Wait, but if three consecutive objects have one of them being diametrically opposite to another? Let

---------------

's see. Let me think of a specific example. Let's say object 1 is adjacent to 2 and 36. The

---------------

 diametrically opposite of 1 is 19. So if we have triplet (1,2,19), then

---------------

 1 and 19 are opposite, and 1 and 2 are adjacent. So that's a valid triplet in A ∩ D. Similarly

---------------

, triplet (2,3,20), etc. So in this case, each such triplet is only counted once when

---------------

 considering the adjacent pair (1,2) and adding 19. So even if the triplet has another adjacent pair (

---------------

like (2,3)), but in this case, the triplet (1,2,19) only has one adjacent pair (1,2).

---------------

 The other pair (2,19) is not adjacent. So such a triplet is only counted once.

Therefore, the

---------------

 total count via 36 adjacent pairs * 2 is 72, but we need to check if there are any

---------------

 overlaps where a triplet is counted more than once. But as per above, it seems each triplet is counted exactly once. Because

---------------

 for a triplet in A ∩ D, there is exactly one adjacent pair in it (since otherwise, if there were two adjacent pairs, the

---------------

 third element would be two away from the first, so not opposite). Therefore, each triplet in A ∩ D is counted exactly once in

---------------

 this method. Hence, the total A ∩ D is 72. Wait, but hold on, let me think

---------------

 again.

Wait, in the example I had, (A, B, A_opposite): this triplet has the adjacent pair (A,B) and the diametrically opposite pair (A, A_opposite). So

---------------

 counted once when considering the adjacent pair (A,B). Similarly, (A,B,B_opposite) is counted once when considering (

---------------

A,B). So each triplet is indeed counted once. Thus, the total is 36*2=72. But

---------------

 let me check another way.

Alternatively, think of how many such triplets exist. For each object A, the adjacent pairs

---------------

 are (A, A+1) and (A-1, A). For each A, the diametrically opposite of

---------------

 A is A+18 (mod 36). So for each adjacent pair (A, A+1), the third

---------------

 object can be A-18 or (A+1)-18 = A-17 (mod 36). Wait, but

---------------

 maybe better to think in terms of each A.

Alternatively, for each object A, there is an adjacent pair (A, A+1). The diametrically opposite of

---------------

 A is A+18. So the triplet (A, A+1, A+18) would be one

---------------

 such triplet. Similarly, the diametrically opposite of A+1 is (A+1)+18 = A+19. So the

---------------

 triplet (A, A+1, A+19) is another. Therefore, for each A, there are two triplets.

---------------

 Since there are 36 objects, each contributing two triplets, but each triplet is being counted once per its adjacent pair. Since

---------------

 each triplet has exactly one adjacent pair, this counts each exactly once. So total is 36*2=72. So

---------------

 that seems correct. Therefore, A ∩ D is 72.

Therefore, going back to inclusion-exclusion, the number

---------------

 of triplets with at least one forbidden pair (either adjacent or diametrically opposite) is A + D - (A ∩ D) = 1,188 + 612 - 72 = 

---------------

1,188 + 612 is 1,800; minus 72 is 1,728.

Therefore, the number of valid triplets is Total - (A + D - A ∩ D) = 7,140 - 1,728 = 5,412.



---------------

Wait, hold on a second. Wait, no. Wait, the inclusion-exclusion formula for the count of triplets that

---------------

 have at least one forbidden pair is A + D - (A ∩ D). Therefore, the valid triplets are Total - (A + D - A ∩ D)

---------------

 = 7140 - (1188 + 612 - 72) = 7140 - 1728 = 5412.

---------------

 Hmm, but let me verify this.

Alternatively, let me check my calculations again step by step.

First, Total triplets: 36C3 = 7140.

A

---------------

 (triplets with at least one adjacent pair): 7140 - (non-adjacent triplets). The

---------------

 non-adjacent triplets were calculated as 5952. So 7140 - 5952 = 1188. That's

---------------

 correct.

D (triplets with at least one diametrically opposite pair): 18 diametrically opposite pairs, each can

---------------

 pair with 34 other objects, so 18*34=612. Correct.

A ∩ D: 72.

---------------

 So inclusion-exclusion gives A + D - A∩D = 1188 +612 -72 = 1728.

Total

---------------

 - forbidden = 7140 -1728 = 5412.

Hmm, but wait a

---------------

 second, the problem says "no two chosen objects are adjacent OR diametrically opposite". Wait, actually, the wording is "

---------------

no two chosen objects are adjacent or diametrically opposite". So that means that in the triplet, none of the three pairs can be adjacent or diametrically opposite. So

---------------

 each pair must be neither adjacent nor diametrically opposite.

Therefore, my calculation above may have an error. Wait, let

---------------

 me check.

Wait, in inclusion-exclusion, when we subtract A and D, we subtract all triplets with at least one adjacent pair or

---------------

 at least one diametrically opposite pair. So the remaining should be triplets with no adjacent pairs and no diametrically opposite pairs. So

---------------

 that's exactly what we need. So the calculation seems correct.

But let me see if 5412 is the correct

---------------

 answer, but maybe I made a mistake in computing non-adjacent triplets?

Wait, let me recompute the non-adjacent triplets again

---------------

. The formula was C(n -k, k) + C(n -k -1, k -1). For n=36, k=3,

---------------

 so:

C(33,3) + C(32,2).

C(33,3) is (33×32×31)/6.

---------------

 Let me compute that again.

33×32 = 1056. 1056×31 =

---------------

 let's see, 1000×31 = 31,000, 56×31=1,736,

---------------

 so total 31,000 +1,736 = 32,736. Div

---------------

ided by 6: 32,736 /6 = 5,456.

C(32,2) is (32×31)/2 = 496. So

---------------

 total non-adjacent triplets: 5,456 + 496 = 5,952. So

---------------

 that's correct.

So 7140 - 5952 = 1188. That's

---------------

 A. Okay.

Then D is 18×34 = 612. Correct.

A ∩ D is 72. So

---------------

 total forbidden triplets: 1188 +612 -72 = 1728. So

---------------

 total allowed is 7140 -1728 = 5412. Hmm, but let me think

---------------

 again.

Wait, but there is another way to compute the desired count directly, maybe?

Alternatively, let me try computing the

---------------

 number of triplets with no two adjacent and no two diametrically opposite. That is exactly what we need. So that

---------------

 would be the total non-adjacent triplets (5952) minus those non-adjacent triplets which have at least one diametrically opposite pair.

Wait, that

---------------

's another approach. Let me see:

The desired count = (number of triplets with no two adjacent) minus (number of triplets with no two adjacent but at

---------------

 least one diametrically opposite pair).

Let me compute that way as a check.

First, non-adjacent triplets: 5952.

Now, from

---------------

 these, we need to subtract those triplets which have at least one diametrically opposite pair but no adjacent pairs.

So

---------------

, how many triplets have no two adjacent but do have at least one diametrically opposite pair?

Let me call this number

---------------

 X. Then desired count is 5952 - X.

To compute X:

These are triplets where one pair is diametrically opposite, and the third is

---------------

 neither adjacent to either of them nor forming another forbidden pair (but since they are non-adjacent, we just need to ensure that

---------------

 the third is not adjacent to either, but also not diametrically opposite to any? Wait, no. Wait, the

---------------

 triplet has one diametrically opposite pair and the third is not adjacent to either, but could be diametrically opposite to another

---------------

?

Wait, actually, in this case, since we are considering triplets with no two adjacent but with at least one diametrically opposite pair. So the

---------------

 triplet has exactly one diametrically opposite pair, and the third element is not adjacent to either of the pair, nor forming

---------------

 another diametrically opposite pair? Or is that allowed?

Wait, the requirement is that in the desired count, there are no two adjacent

---------------

 and no two diametrically opposite. So in the forbidden X, we have triplets that have no two adjacent but do have a diametrically opposite pair. So they

---------------

 are invalid because of the diametrically opposite pair. So we need to subtract those.

To compute X: the number of triplets with exactly

---------------

 one diametrically opposite pair and the third element not adjacent to either of the pair.

Wait, but actually, even if the third element is adjacent to one

---------------

 of them, but since the triplet is supposed to have no two adjacent, then such a triplet would already be excluded from the non-adjacent triple

---------------

ts. Therefore, in the non-adjacent triplets, any triplet with a diametrically opposite pair must have the third element neither adjacent to the pair nor forming another diam

---------------

etrically opposite pair.

Wait, actually, in the non-adjacent triplets, the third element can still be diametrically opposite to one of the pair

---------------

, but that would form another diametrically opposite pair.

Wait, let me clarify. Let me think of a triplet (

---------------

A, B, C) where A and B are diametrically opposite, and C is not adjacent to A or B.

---------------

 But if C is diametrically opposite to A or B, then that would form another diametrically opposite pair. However

---------------

, such a triplet would still be in the non-adjacent triplets (since no two adjacent), but we need to exclude those

---------------

 with any diametrically opposite pairs. So X is exactly the number of triplets in non-adjacent triplets that have at least one diametrically opposite pair.

Therefore

---------------

, X is equal to the number of triplets with a diametrically opposite pair and the third element not adjacent to either member

---------------

 of the pair.

So how do we compute X?

First, the number of diametrically opposite pairs is 18. For each such pair (A, A_op

---------------

posite), we need to choose a third element C such that C is not adjacent to A or A_opposite, and also,

---------------

 C is not forming another diametrically opposite pair with either A or A_opposite. Wait, but actually, since we

---------------

 are counting all triplets with at least one diametrically opposite pair, and the third element can be anything except adjacent to

---------------

 A or A_opposite (since the triplet must be non-adjacent). Wait, but actually, the non-adjacent triple

---------------

ts already exclude any adjacency. So for each diametrically opposite pair (A, A_opposite), the third element can

---------------

 be any of the remaining 34 objects except those adjacent to A or A_opposite. Each of A and A_opposite has two adjacent objects, so total forbidden for

---------------

 C are 2 + 2 =4 objects. But since A and A_opposite are 18 apart, their adjacent objects are distinct. So

---------------

 the forbidden are A-1, A+1, A_opposite-1, A_opposite+1. So 

---------------

4 distinct objects. So the number of available C's is 36 - 2 (the pair) -4 (adjacent to pair

---------------

) = 30.

Wait, let me compute step by step:

Total objects excluding A and A_opposite: 34.

From these 34, we

---------------

 must exclude the two adjacent to A and the two adjacent to A_opposite. Since these are four distinct objects (because A

---------------

 and A_opposite are 18 apart, their neighbors are not overlapping). So 34 -4 = 30.

Therefore, for each diametrically opposite pair, there are 30 possible Cs

---------------

. So total X = 18 * 30 = 540.

But wait, but this counts each

---------------

 triplet exactly once, right? Because each triplet with a diametrically opposite pair is counted once for that pair. Since a triplet can't

---------------

 have two diametrically opposite pairs, so no overlaps. Therefore, X = 18 *30 = 540.

Therefore, the desired count is

---------------

 5952 - 540 = 5412. Which matches the previous result. So that's a

---------------

 good check.

Therefore, the answer is 5412. Wait, but hold on, but let me think once more to

---------------

 be thorough.

Wait, but in the first approach, we had 7140 - (1188 +612 -72)= 

---------------

5412. In the second approach, we had 5952 -540=5412. So both

---------------

 agree. So that gives me more confidence.

But let me check another way. Let's compute directly the number of triplets with no two adjacent and no two diametrically opposite.

To

---------------

 do that, perhaps arrange the 36 objects in a circle, and choose three such that none are adjacent and none are opposite. Hmm

---------------

, maybe inclusion-exclusion again but more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps use the principle of inclusion-exclusion but considering both conditions from

---------------

 the start.

Alternatively, let me try to compute it step by step.

First, pick the first object, say object 1. Then the second object can

---------------

't be adjacent to 1 (so not 2 or 36) and can't be diametrically opposite (19). Also

---------------

, can't be 1 itself. So from 36, subtract 2 (adjacent) +1 (opposite) +1 (itself) = 34 available

---------------

. Wait, but actually, we have to choose three distinct objects, so first object is 1, second can be any except 1, 

---------------

2, 36, 19. So 36 -4 =32. Wait, but this is

---------------

 getting into a counting method which might be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps using the multiplication principle but considering the restrictions.

But perhaps

---------------

 it's better to stick with the previous results since they cross-validate.

Wait, but let me check the value 5412 with

---------------

 another angle.

Suppose the answer is 5412, but I want to see if that's reasonable. Let

---------------

 me see:

Total triplets: ~7k, subtract ~1.7k forbidden, getting ~5.4k. Seems

---------------

 plausible.

Alternatively, let me think about the diametrically opposite pairs again. Each diametrically opposite pair has 30 possible

---------------

 third elements in the non-adjacent case. So 18*30=540. So subtract that

---------------

 from non-adjacent gives 5412.

Alternatively, if I made an error in calculating the adjacent pairs?



---------------

Wait, let me think about the A ∩ D term again. I thought it was 72. Let me confirm

---------------

 again with another approach.

Suppose we have an adjacent pair (A, A+1). The third element must be either A's

---------------

 opposite or (A+1)'s opposite. The opposite of A is A+18, and opposite of A+1 is (A+1)+18 = A+19.

---------------

 Now, we need to ensure that these third elements are not adjacent to the pair.

Wait, the third element being A+18: is

---------------

 A+18 adjacent to A or A+1? Since the distance between A and A+18 is 18, which is not

---------------

 adjacent (adjacent is 1). The distance between A+1 and A+18 is 17, which is also not adjacent. Similarly, the

---------------

 distance from A to A+19 is 19, which is not adjacent. So the third elements A+18 and A+19 are not

---------------

 adjacent to the pair (A, A+1). Therefore, the triplet (A, A+1, A+18) is

---------------

 valid for A ∩ D (has an adjacent pair and a diametrically opposite pair). Similarly for (A, A+1, A+19). Therefore

---------------

, each adjacent pair indeed contributes two triplets to A ∩ D. Since there are 36 adjacent pairs, 

---------------

36×2=72. So that is correct.

Therefore, all steps seem consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 5412. Wait

---------------

, but the problem says "no two chosen objects are adjacent or diametrically opposite". So that's exactly the count we arrived

---------------

 at, 5412. Therefore, I think that is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
Answer: 5412


To determine the number of ways to choose 3 objects from 36 arranged in a circle such that no two chosen objects are adjacent or diametrically opposite, we use the inclusion-exclusion principle.

1. **Total number of ways to choose 3 objects**

---------------

:
   \[
   \binom{36}{3} = \frac{36 \times 35 \times 34}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 7140
   \]

2. **Number of triplets with at least one adjacent pair (A)**:
   - First

---------------

, calculate the number of non-adjacent triplets using the formula for circular arrangements:
     \[
     \binom{33}{3} + \binom{32}{2} = 5456 + 496 = 5952
     \]
   - Subtract from the total to get A

---------------

:
     \[
     A = 7140 - 5952 = 1188
     \]

3. **Number of triplets with at least one diametrically opposite pair (D)**:
   - There are 18 diametrically opposite pairs. Each pair can be combined with any of the remaining 34 objects:
     \[
     D = 18 \times 34 = 612
     \]

4. **Number of triplets with both an adjacent pair and a diametrically opposite pair (A ∩ D)**:
   - For each of the 36 adjacent pairs, there are 2 possible third objects (the

---------------

 opposites of each element in the pair):
     \[
     A \cap D = 36 \times 2 = 72
     \]

5. **Apply inclusion-exclusion principle**:
   - Calculate the number of forbidden triplets:
     \[
     A + D - (A \cap D) = 1188 + 612 - 72 = 1728
     \]
   - Subtract from the total to get the valid triplets:
     \[
     7140 - 1728 = 5412
     \]

Thus, the number of ways to choose 3 objects such that no two are adjacent or diametrically opposite is \(\boxed{5412}\).
