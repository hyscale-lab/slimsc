Okay, so I need to solve the equation sin x + cos x = √2/2 and find the sum of the first 20 positive real solutions, then give the integer part of that sum. Hmm, let's start by recalling

---------------

 some trigonometric identities or methods to solve such equations. 

First, maybe I can rewrite sin x + cos x in a different form. I remember there's a formula to

---------------

 combine sine and cosine into a single sine function. Like, a sin x + b cos x can be written as R sin(x + φ) or something like that. Let me recall

---------------

 the exact formula. 

Yes, the identity is: a sin x + b cos x = √(a² + b²) sin(x + φ), where φ is the phase shift such that tan φ = b/a. Wait, actually, maybe

---------------

 it's cos φ = a/√(a² + b²) and sin φ = b/√(a² + b²).

---------------

 Let me check. 

Alternatively, another way is to write it as √2 sin(x + π/4). Let

---------------

 me see: sin x + cos x = √2 sin(x + π/4). Because sin(x + π/4) = sin x cos π/4 + cos x sin π/4 = (sin x + cos x)/√2. So multiplying by √2 gives exactly sin x + cos x. So

---------------

 that works! 

Therefore, the equation becomes √2 sin(x + π/4) = √2 / 2. Div

---------------

iding both sides by √2 gives sin(x + π/4) = 1/2. 

Alright, so now

---------------

 the equation is sin(θ) = 1/2 where θ = x + π/4. The general solution for sin θ = 1/2 is θ = π/6 + 2πk or θ = 5π/6 + 2πk, where k is any integer. 

Therefore, substituting back θ = x + π/4, we have:

Case 1: x + π/4 = π/6 + 2πk ⇒

---------------

 x = π/6 - π/4 + 2πk = (2π/12 - 3π/12) + 2πk = (-π/12) + 2πk

Case 2: x + π/4 = 5π/6 + 2πk ⇒ x = 5π/6 - π/4 + 2πk = (10π/12 - 3π/12) + 2πk = 7π/12 + 2πk

So

---------------

 the solutions are x = -π/12 + 2πk and x = 7π/12 + 2πk for integers k. 



---------------

But we need the positive real solutions. Let's find for which k these expressions are positive.

First, for the first case: x = -π/12 + 2πk. To

---------------

 be positive, we need -π/12 + 2πk > 0 ⇒ 2πk > π/12 ⇒ k > 1/24. Since k must be an integer, the smallest k here is k=1. Then

---------------

, substituting k=1 gives x = -π/12 + 2π = (24π/12 - π/12) = 23π/12. Hmm

---------------

, but wait, that's actually 23π/12 ≈ 6.03 radians, which is positive

---------------

. Wait, but maybe there are smaller positive solutions from the second case?

Looking at the second case: x = 7π/12 + 2πk. For

---------------

 k=0, x = 7π/12 ≈ 1.832 radians, which is positive. So the

---------------

 first solution comes from the second case when k=0. The first case's first positive solution is at k=1,

---------------

 which is 23π/12. So the solutions in order will be starting from 7π/12, then 23π/12, then adding

---------------

 2π each time? Wait, let me check.

Wait, perhaps I need to list all solutions and order them.

---------------

 Let me see:

The solutions can be written as two sequences:

First sequence from case 1: x = -π/12 + 2πk. For

---------------

 k=1: 23π/12, k=2: -π/12 + 4π = 47π/12, etc.

Second sequence from case 2: x =7π/12 +2πk. For k=0:7π/12, k=1:7π/12 +2π=31π/12, k=2: 

---------------

55π/12, etc.

Now, to order these solutions from smallest to largest, we need to see which

---------------

 comes first between the first case's solutions and the second case's solutions.

The first solution from case 2 when k=0 is 7π/12 ≈ 1.832.

---------------

 The first solution from case 1 when k=1 is 23π/12 ≈ 6.03. So

---------------

 indeed, the first solution is 7π/12, then the next would be 23π/12?

---------------

 Wait, no. Wait, between k=0 and k=1 for case 2, let's see.

Wait,

---------------

 actually, let's list the first few solutions:

From case 2 (starting at k=0):

x₁ =7π/12 �

---------------

�1.832,

x₂ (next solution from case 2 with k=1) is 7π/12 +2π =

---------------

 31π/12 ≈8.163,

x₃ from case1 with k=1 is

---------------

 23π/12≈6.03,

Wait, but 23π/12 is about

---------------

 6.03, which is less than 31π/12 (~8.16). So the

---------------

 ordering would be:

First: 7π/12 (k=0 from case2),

Second:23π/12 (k=1 from case1),

Third:31π/12 (k=1 from case2),

Fourth: 

---------------

23π/12 + 2π = 23π/12 +24π/12=47π/12 �

---------------

�12.06,

Wait, but wait, let's see step by step.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider

---------------

 all solutions and list them in order.

Let me list the solutions in order:

Starting from k=0 in case2: 7π/12 (~

---------------

1.832).

Then the next solution would be the next smallest, which is from case1 with k=1: 

---------------

23π/12 (~6.03).

Then next would be case2 with k=1: 31π/12 (~8.163).

Then next

---------------

 is case1 with k=2: -π/12 +4π =47π/12 (~12.06).

Then case2 with k=2: 

---------------

55π/12 (~14.45).

Then case1 with k=3: 23π/12 +4π = 

---------------

23π/12 +48π/12=71π/12 (~18.90

---------------

).

Wait, actually, each subsequent solution alternates between case1 and case2, each time adding 2π? Wait

---------------

, perhaps the pattern is that the solutions are spaced by π?

Wait, let me think again. Let's note that the

---------------

 two solutions for θ are π/6 and 5π/6 in each 2π interval. Then, when

---------------

 we subtract π/4, the x solutions would be each of those minus π/4. So in each 2π interval of

---------------

 θ, there are two solutions for θ, so each 2π interval for x also has two solutions, but

---------------

 shifted.

Alternatively, perhaps the solutions for x are spaced by π, but offset?

Wait, perhaps let's look at the general

---------------

 solutions again. The solutions for x are:

From case1: x = -π/12 + 2πk,

and case2: x =7π/12 +2πk.



---------------

So, if we consider all solutions, they can be written as x =7π/12 +2πk and x = -π/12 +2πk for

---------------

 integer k. 

But note that x = -π/12 +2πk can also be written as x= (24πk - π)/12 =

---------------

 (24k -1)π/12,

and x=7π/12 +2πk = (7π +24πk)/12 = (24k +7)π/12.

Therefore

---------------

, all solutions can be written as (24k +7)π/12 and (24k -1)π/12 for integers

---------------

 k.

But to arrange them in order, let's see:

Let me think of k values such that the solutions are positive.

---------------

 Let me tabulate some values:

For case2 (7π/12 +2πk):

k=0:7π/12 �

---------------

�1.832,

k=1:7π/12 +2π = 31π/12 ≈8.163,

k=2:5

---------------

5π/12≈14.45,

k=3:79π/12≈20.74,

k=4:103π/12≈27.03,

k=5:127π/12≈33.32,

k

---------------

=6:151π/12≈39.61,

and so on.

For case1 (-π/12 +2πk):

k=1: -

---------------

π/12 +2π =23π/12≈6.03,

k=2: -π/12 +4π=47π/12≈12.06,

k=3: -π/12 +6π=71π/12≈18.90,

k=4: -π/12 +8π=95π/12≈25.18,

k=5: -π/12 +10π=119π/12≈31.47,

k=6: -π/12 +12π=143π/12≈37.76,

and so on.

Now, let

---------------

's list all solutions in order:

Starting from the smallest positive:

First solution is case2 with k=0:7π/12≈

---------------

1.832 (x₁).

Next is case1 with k=1:23π/12≈6.03 (x₂).

Then case2 with k=1:31π/12≈8.163 (x₃).

Then case1 with k=2:47π/12≈12.06 (x₄).

Then case2 with k=2:55π/12≈14.45 (x₅).

Then

---------------

 case1 with k=3:71π/12≈18.90 (x₆).

Then case2 with k=3:79π/12≈20.74 (x₇).

Wait, hold on,

---------------

 between x₅ (≈14.45) and x₆ (≈18.90), but

---------------

 case1 with k=3 is 71π/12≈18.90, and case2 with k=3 is 79π/12≈20.74.

---------------

 Wait, but between x₅ (≈14.45) and x₆, is there another solution? Let

---------------

 me check.

Wait, after x₅ (55π/12 ≈14.45):

Next would

---------------

 be case1 with k=3:71π/12≈18.90, and case2 with k=3:

---------------

79π/12≈20.74. So 18.90 comes before 20.74. So that

---------------

's correct.

Continuing:

x₆:71π/12≈18.90,

x₇:79π/12≈20.74,

x

---------------

₈: case1 with k=4:95π/12≈25.18,

x₉: case2 with k=4:103π/12≈27.03,

x₁₀: case1 with k=5:119π/12≈31.47,

x₁₁: case2 with k=5:127π/12≈33.32,

x₁₂: case1 with k=6:143π/12≈37.76,

x₁₃: case2 with k=6:151π/12≈39.61,

and

---------------

 so on.

Wait, so the pattern here is that each pair of solutions (case2 and case1) alternates,

---------------

 but each time increasing by 2π? Let me see the spacing between consecutive solutions:

Between x₁ (≈1.832) and x₂ (≈6.03): difference �

---------------

�4.2.

Between x₂ and x₃ (≈8.163): difference ≈2.13.

Between x₃ and x₄ (≈12.06): difference≈3.9.

Hmm, that

---------------

 seems inconsistent. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the ordering. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps there's a better

---------------

 way to see the pattern. Let me think of all solutions as two interleaved arithmetic sequences.

The solutions from case2:

---------------

 starting at 7π/12 and increasing by 2π each time: 7π/12, 31π/12, 55π/12, etc

---------------

. So each term is previous + 2π.

The solutions from case1: starting at 23π/12 (when

---------------

 k=1) and increasing by 2π each time: 23π/12, 47π/12, 71π/12, etc.

So

---------------

 the two sequences are:

Case2: 7π/12, 31π/12, 55π/12, 79π/12, 103π/12, 127π/12, 151π/12, ...

---------------

 (each +24π/12=2π)

Case1:23π/12, 47π/12, 71π/12, 95π/12, 119π/12, 143π/12, 167π/12, ... (each +24π/12=2π)

Now, to

---------------

 interleave these two sequences in order, let's see:

Start with the first term of case2:7π/12 (

---------------

x₁)

Then the first term of case1:23π/12 (x₂)

Then the second term of case2:31π/12 (x₃)

Then the second term of case1:47π/12 (x₄)

Then third term case2:55π/12 (x₅)

Third term case1:71π/12 (x₆)

Fourth term case2:79π/12 (x₇)

Fourth term case1:95π/12 (x₈)

And

---------------

 so on. So the pattern is that the solutions alternate between case2 and case1 terms, each time taking the next term from each sequence altern

---------------

ately. Therefore, the sequence of solutions is:

x₁ =7π/12,

x₂=23π/12,

x₃=31π/12,

x₄=47π/12,

x₅=55π/12,

x₆=71π/12,

x₇=79π/12,

x₈=95π/12,

x₉=103π/12,

x₁₀=119π/12,

x₁₁=127π/12,

x₁₂=143π/12,

x₁₃=151π/12,

x₁₄=167π/12,

x₁₅=175π/12,

Wait

---------------

, hold on, perhaps I need to check the next terms. Wait, after x₈=95π/12 (

---------------

≈25.18), the next would be case2's fourth term:103π/12 (

---------------

≈27.03), so x₉=103π/12,

x₁₀ is case1's fifth term: 

---------------

119π/12 (≈31.47),

x₁₁ is case2's fifth term:127π/12≈

---------------

33.32,

x₁₂ is case1's sixth term:143π/12≈37.76,

x₁₃ is case2's sixth term:151π/12≈39.61,

x₁₄ is

---------------

 case1's seventh term:167π/12≈44.0,

Wait, 167π/12 is

---------------

 (167*3.1416)/12 ≈ (524.8)/12≈43.73,



---------------

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate more carefully.

Wait, maybe I should note that each pair of solutions (case2 and

---------------

 case1) after the first two terms form an arithmetic progression with a common difference?

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider

---------------

 that each solution alternates between the two sequences, so the nth solution is:

If n is odd: it comes from case2,

---------------

 term (n+1)/2,

If n is even: it comes from case1, term n/2.

Wait,

---------------

 let's see:

For n=1 (odd): case2 term (1+1)/2=1st term:

---------------

7π/12,

n=2 (even): case1 term 2/2=1st term:23π/12,

n=3 (odd): case2 term 2nd term:31π/12,

n=4 (even): case1 term 2nd term:47π/12,

Yes, that

---------------

 works. So in general,

For odd n=2k-1: x_{2k-1}= case2's kth term =

---------------

7π/12 +2π(k-1),

For even n=2k: x_{2k}= case1's kth term=23π/12 +2π(k-1).

Alternatively

---------------

, maybe better to write formulas for x_n.

Let me see:

The first solution (n=1):7π/12,

The

---------------

 second (n=2):23π/12,

Third (n=3):31π/12,

Fourth (n=4):47π/12,

Fifth (n=5):55π/12,

Six

---------------

th (n=6):71π/12,

Etc.

Looking at the terms, each term alternates between adding 16π/12 and 14π/12?

---------------

 Wait:

From x₁ to x₂:23π/12 -7π/12=16π/12=

---------------

4π/3,

x₂ to x₃:31π/12 -23π/12=8π/12=2π/3,

x₃ to x₄:47π/12 -31π/12=16π/12=4π/3,

x₄ to x₅:55π/12 -47π/12=8π/12=2π/3,

Hmm

---------------

, so the differences alternate between 4π/3 and 2π/3. Interesting. So the pattern is +

---------------

4π/3, +2π/3, +4π/3, +2π/3, etc. So

---------------

 every two terms, the total increase is 6π/3=2π. That makes sense since the solutions are part

---------------

 of two sequences each with period 2π, interleaved.

Therefore, over every two terms, the total increment is 2π, so the

---------------

 average spacing between consecutive terms is π. But individually, they alternate between 4π/3 and 2π/3.

However

---------------

, perhaps the key is to find a general formula for the nth term. Let me try to see:

Looking at the first

---------------

 few terms:

n | x_n (in terms of π/12)
1 |7
2 |23
3 |31
4 |47
5 |55
6 |71
7 |79
8 |95
9 |103
10|119
11|127
12|143
13|151
14|167
15|175
...



---------------

Looking at the coefficients:

Term 1:7,

Term2:23,

Term3:31,

Term4:47,

Term5:55,

Term6:71,

Term

---------------

7:79,

Term8:95,

Term9:103,

Term10:119,

Term

---------------

11:127,

Term12:143,

Term13:151,

Term14:167,

Term15:175,...

Looking

---------------

 at the differences between terms:

Between term1 and term2:16,

term2-term3:+8,

term3-term4:+16,

term4-term5:+8,

term5-term6:+16,

term6-term7:+8,

term

---------------

7-term8:+16,

term8-term9:+8,

term9-term10:+16,

term10-term11:+8,

term11-term12:+16,

term12-term13:+8,

term13-term14:+16,

term14-term15:+8,



---------------

So the differences between coefficients (in units of π/12) alternate between +16 and +8. So the

---------------

 sequence of coefficients is 7, 23,31,47,55,71, etc.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the nth term can be expressed as follows:

Looking for a pattern. Let me see:

Term 1:7 =

---------------

7,

Term2:23 =7 +16,

Term3:23 +8=31,

Term4:31 +16=47,

Term5:47 +8=55,

Term6:55 +16=71,

E

---------------

tc. So every two terms, the coefficient increases by 24 (16+8). So over two terms, the

---------------

 coefficient increases by 24. So every pair of terms (odd and even n) increases by 24.

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps for term n, the coefficient is 7 + 24*(floor((n)/2)) + something?



---------------

Wait, let's see for n=1:

floor(1/2)=0, so 7 +24*0=7.

---------------

 Then, for odd n: 7 +24*( (n-1)/2 ) + ?

Wait, maybe for

---------------

 odd n=2k-1:

The coefficient is 7 +24*(k-1) + 0?



---------------

Wait term1 (k=1):7 +24*(0)=7,

term3 (k=2):7+24*(1)=31,



---------------

term5 (k=3):7+24*2=55,

Yes, that works for the odd terms.



---------------

For even n=2k:

The coefficient is 23 +24*(k-1). For example,

term2 (k=1):23,

term4 (k=2):23 +24=47,

term6 (k=3):23 +48=71,

Yes

---------------

, that works. So:

For odd n=2k-1: coefficient =7 +24(k-1)=

---------------

24k -17,

Wait 7 +24(k-1)=24k -24 +7=24k -17,



---------------

Wait 24k -17? Let me check:

For k=1:24(1)-17=7,

---------------

 yes,

k=2:24(2)-17=48-17=31, yes,

k=3:24*3-17=72-17=55, correct,

Yes

---------------

.

Similarly for even n=2k: coefficient=23 +24(k-1)=24k -1,

Check

---------------

:

k=1:24(1)-1=23,

k=2:24*2-1=47,

k=3:24*3 -1=71,

Perfect

---------------

.

Therefore, in general:

For n odd: n=2k-1,

x_{2k-1}= (24k -17)π/12,

For n even: n=2k,

x_{2k}= (24k -1)π/12.

Alternatively, we

---------------

 can write a general formula for x_n in terms of n.

Let me see if we can write this as a function of n:



---------------

Let me consider n as either even or odd.

Suppose n is odd: n=2m-1,

then m

---------------

=(n+1)/2,

so x_n= (24*( (n+1)/2 ) -17 ) π/12,

=

---------------

 (12(n+1) -17) π/12,

= (12n +12 -17)/12 π,

= (12n -5)/12 π,

Hmm

---------------

,

Wait let's compute:

24*( (n+1)/2 ) =12(n+1),

then subtract

---------------

 17,

so 12(n+1) -17 =12n +12 -17=12n -5,

Therefore

---------------

,

x_n= (12n -5)π/(12).

Wait, let's check for n=1:

---------------

 (12*1 -5)π/12=7π/12, correct.

n=3: (36 -5)

---------------

π/12=31π/12, correct,

Yes, that works.

For even n=2m,

x

---------------

_n= (24m -1)π/12,

where m =n/2,

so substituting m

---------------

 =n/2,

x_n= (24*(n/2) -1)π/12 = (12n -1)π/12,

Check n

---------------

=2: (24*1 -1)π/12=23π/12,

Yes,

---------------

 and n=4: (48 -1)/12 π=47π/12, correct.

Therefore

---------------

, the general formula is:

For any positive integer n,

x_n = ( (12n -5)π )

---------------

 /12 if n is odd,

x_n = ( (12n -1)π ) /12 if n is even.

Alternatively, combining

---------------

 both cases:

x_n = [12n - (5 if n odd else 1)] π /12.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps we can write this as:

x_n = ( (12n - a_n )π ) /12,

---------------

 where a_n is 5 when n odd, 1 when even.

Alternatively, note that 12n - (5 +

---------------

 4*(n mod 2)), but maybe not necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write it as x_n = (1

---------------

2n - (5*(n mod 2) +1*(1 -n mod 2))) π/12,



---------------

but maybe that complicates.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express it as:

x_n = π/12*(12n - c

---------------

_n),

where c_n is 5 for odd n and 1 for even n.

Alternatively, let me see if there

---------------

's a way to write a single formula without piecewise.

Alternatively, notice that for odd n, 12n -5 = 

---------------

12(n - 0.5) - (5 - 6*0.5)= ?

Hmm, maybe not helpful

---------------

.

Alternatively, perhaps notice that for all n,

x_n = (12n - (5 + 4*(n mod 2))) π

---------------

 /12,

Wait, let's test for n=1 (odd):

5 +4*(1 mod2)=5+4=

---------------

9,

so 12*1 -9=3, 3π/12= π/4, which

---------------

 is not correct. Wait, that's not working.

Hmm, maybe better to stick with the piecewise formula.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 it's easier to separate the sum into odd and even terms.

Since we need the sum up to n=20, which is even, so

---------------

 20 terms consist of 10 odd terms and 10 even terms?

Wait, 20 terms: from

---------------

 n=1 to 20, so 10 odd and 10 even terms.

Wait, n=1 (

---------------

odd) to n=20 (even), so yes, 10 each.

Therefore, we can compute the sum as

---------------

:

Sum = sum_{k=1 to 10} x_{2k-1} + sum_{k=1 to10} x_{2k}

From

---------------

 the formulas above,

For odd terms (n=2k-1):

x_{2k-1}= (12*(2k-1) -5)

---------------

π/12 = (24k -12 -5)π/12 = (24k -17)π/12,

Wait,

---------------

 but earlier we had for n=2k-1,

so substit

---------------

uting n=2k-1,

x_{2k-1}= (12*(2k-1) -5)π/12 = (24k -12 -5)π/12 = (24k -17)π/12,

Yes

---------------

,

Similarly for even terms,

x_{2k}= (12*(2k) -1)π/12=(

---------------

24k -1)π/12,

Therefore,

Sum = Σ_{k=1 to10} (24k -17)π/12 + Σ_{k=1 to10} (24k -1)π/12

Let

---------------

 me compute each sum separately.

First sum (odd terms):

Sum1 = Σ_{k=1 to10} (24k -17)π/12



---------------

= π/12 [ Σ_{k=1 to10}24k - Σ_{k=1 to10}17 ]

= π/12 [24 �

---------------

�k -17*10 ]

Similarly, Σk from1 to10 is (10)(11)/2=55,

Thus

---------------

,

Sum1= π/12 [24*55 -170 ]

= π/12 [1320 -170]



---------------

= π/12 [1150]

Similarly, second sum (even terms):

Sum2= Σ_{k=1 to10} (24k -1)π/12

= π/12 [2

---------------

4 Σk - Σ1 ]

= π/12 [24*55 -10 ]

=

---------------

 π/12 [1320 -10 ]

= π/12 [1310]

Therefore

---------------

 total Sum= Sum1 + Sum2 = π/12*(1150 +1310)= π/12*(2460)= π*(

---------------

2460/12)= π*(205).

So the total sum is 205π.

Wait, that

---------------

's a nice simplification! Let me check the calculations again to make sure.

First Sum1:

24*55:

---------------

 24*50=1200, 24*5=120, so total 1320,



---------------

1320 -170=1150,

Sum1=1150π/12,

Sum2:

24*55=1320,

1320 -10=1310,

Sum2=1310π/12,

Total

---------------

 sum:

(1150 +1310)=2460,

2460/12=205,

Yes

---------------

, so 205π.

Therefore, the sum of the first 20 solutions is 205π.

Now

---------------

, the question asks for the integer part of this sum.

We need to compute 205 multiplied by π, then

---------------

 take the integer part.

Since π≈3.1415926535,

205 *

---------------

 π ≈205 *3.1415926535.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 200π =

---------------

 200*3.1415926535 ≈628.3185307,

5π≈15.7079632675,

Thus

---------------

 total 205π≈628.3185307 +15.7079632675≈644.026494.

Wait

---------------

, that can't be. Wait, 200π is approximately 628.3185,

---------------

 plus 5π≈15.70796, so total is 628.3185 +15.70796≈644.0265.

Wait, but that

---------------

 can't be right, because 205*3.1416 is approximately 205*3=615, 205*0.1416≈205*0.1 +205*0.0416≈20.5 +8.548≈29.048, so total≈

---------------

615+29.048≈644.048, yes. So approximately 644.0265

---------------

.

Therefore, the integer part is 644.

Wait, but let me compute more precisely.

Compute 205 *

---------------

 π:

First, π ≈3.141592653589793.

---------------

05 *3=615,

205 *0.141592653589793≈

---------------



First, 200*0.141592653589793=

---------------

28.3185307179586,

5*0.141592653589793≈0.7079632679,

Adding:

---------------

28.3185307179586 +0.7079632679≈29.02649398585

---------------

86,

Thus total:615 +29.0264939858586≈644.0264939858586,

Therefore

---------------

, the integer part is 644.

But wait, the problem says "the integer part of that sum".

Wait

---------------

, but before I confirm, let me check if my calculation of the sum was correct.

Wait, the key step was that

---------------

 the total sum was 205π. Let me verify the steps again.

Sum1 (odd terms):

Each odd term is

---------------

 (24k -17)π/12 for k from1 to10,

Sum over k=1 to10:



---------------

24*(1+2+...+10) -17*10,

24*(55) -170 =

---------------

24*55=1320, 1320-170=1150,

Yes

---------------

,

Sum2 (even terms):

Each term (24k -1)π/12,

Sum over k=1 to10,



---------------

24*(1+2+...+10) -1*(10),

24*55 -10=1320-10=1310,

Total

---------------

 sum:1150+1310=2460,

2460 divided by12 is

---------------

 205,

Yes, so 205π.

Therefore, the sum is exactly 205π,

---------------

 which is approximately 644.02649...,

Thus, the integer part is 644.

Wait

---------------

, but let me make sure that my general formula for x_n is correct, because if there's an error there, the

---------------

 entire calculation is off.

Let me check with the first few terms:

For n=1 (odd):

x₁=(12*1 -5)π/12=(7π)/12 �

---------------

�1.8326,

Which matches the first term,

n=2 (even):

x₂=(12*2 -1)π/12=(23π)/12≈6.038,



---------------

Which is correct,

n=3 (odd):

(12*3-5)=31, so 31π/12≈8.168,

Wait

---------------

 31π/12≈8.168, but in my earlier list, third term was 31π/12≈

---------------

8.163 (which is the same, since π≈3.1416, so 31*3.1416/12≈3

---------------

1*0.2618≈8.1158? Wait, wait, let me compute 31π/12:



---------------

31 divided by12≈2.5833,

2.5833 * π≈2.5833*3.1416≈8.115,



---------------

Wait, but earlier when I listed the terms, I had x₃ as 31π/12≈8.163?

---------------

 Wait, maybe miscalculation before.

Wait, 31π/12:

31 divided by 12 is approximately

---------------

 2.5833333,

times π≈2.5833333 *3.14159265≈2

---------------

.5833*3=7.75, 2.5833*0.14159≈0.365,



---------------

Total≈8.115,

Wait, but earlier I had written 31π/12≈8.163.

---------------

 Wait, that must have been a mistake. Let me recalculate:

Wait 31π/12:

π≈3.14159265,

31 *

---------------

3.14159265 = 31*3=93, 31*0.14159265≈4.389,

Total≈93+4.389=97.389,

Div

---------------

ide by12:97.389/12≈8.11575,

So approximately

---------------

 8.11575,

Whereas earlier when I thought 31π/12≈8.163,

---------------

 that was incorrect. Probably I had miscalculated as 31*3.14/12≈31*0.2618≈8.1158

---------------

.

Similarly, 23π/12≈23*3.1416/12≈23*0.2618≈6.0214

---------------

,

So the first few terms are:

x₁≈1.8326,

x₂≈6.0214,

x₃≈8.1158,

x₄≈(

---------------

47π)/12≈47*3.1416/12≈47*0.2618≈12.30,



---------------

Wait 47π/12≈12.30,

x₅=55π/12≈55*0.2618≈14.40,

x₆=71π/12≈71*0.2618≈18.58,

Wait

---------------

, so the terms are increasing, but the spacing alternates between ~4.189 (from x₁ to x₂),

---------------

 ~2.094 (from x₂ to x₃), ~4.09 (x₃ to x₄), ~2.18 (

---------------

x₄ to x₅), etc., which is consistent with the 4π/3 and 2π/3 differences.



---------------

But the key point is that the general formula seems correct because the sum comes out as 205π, and the

---------------

 approximate value is ~644.026, so the integer part is 644.

Wait, but let

---------------

 me check another term:

Take n=10 (even):

x_{10}= (12*10 -1)π/12=(120-1)π/12=119π/12≈119*0.2618≈31.17

---------------

,

Which matches the earlier calculation of 119π/12≈31.47? Wait, no

---------------

, 119*0.2618≈31.17, but 119*(

---------------

π/12)= (119/12)*π≈9.916666*3.1416≈31.17,



---------------

But in my earlier list, I had x₁₀ as 119π/12≈31.47,

---------------

 which is a miscalculation. Wait, perhaps I used a different approximation for π? Let me check with more precise

---------------

 π value.

Take π≈3.14159265,

119π/12 =

---------------

 (119/12)*π≈9.9166666667 *3.14159265≈

---------------



9 *3.14159265=28.27433385,

0.9166666667 *3.14159265≈2.880,



---------------

Total≈28.274+2.880≈31.154,

So ≈31.154,

---------------

 not 31.47. Wait, so my previous mistake was in the initial listing where I thought 119π/12≈

---------------

31.47, which was wrong. Probably I added an extra 0.3. But the key is that the general

---------------

 formula is correct, so the sum is indeed 205π.

Therefore, the integer part is 644.

Therefore

---------------

, the answer should be 644.

**Final Answer**
Answer: 644


To solve the equation \(\sin x + \cos x = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\) and find the sum of the first 20 positive real solutions, we start by rewriting the equation using a trigonometric identity:

\[
\sin x + \cos x = \sqrt{2} \sin\left(x + \frac{\pi}{4}\right)
\]

Thus, the equation becomes:

\[
\sqrt{2} \sin\left(x + \frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

Dividing both sides by \(\sqrt{2}\):



---------------

\[
\sin\left(x + \frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The general solutions for \(\sin \theta = \frac{1}{2}\) are \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{6} + 2k\pi\) or \(\theta = \frac{5\pi}{6} + 2k\pi\) where \(k\) is an integer. Substituting \(\theta = x + \frac{\pi}{4}\), we get:

1. \(x + \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\pi}{6} + 2k\pi \implies x = -\frac{\pi}{12} + 2k\pi\)
2. \(x + \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{5\pi}{6} + 2k\pi \implies x = \frac{7\pi}{12} + 2k\pi\)

Considering

---------------

 positive solutions, we analyze the sequences:

- For \(x = -\frac{\pi}{12} + 2k\pi\), the smallest positive solution occurs at \(k = 1\): \(x = \frac{23\pi}{12}\).
- For \(x = \frac{7\pi}{12} + 2k\pi\), the smallest positive solution occurs at \(k = 0\): \(x = \frac{7\pi}{12}\).

The solutions are

---------------

 interleaved as follows:

- The solutions from \(x = \frac{7\pi}{12} + 2k\pi\) (case

---------------

 2) are \(\frac{7\pi}{12}, \frac{31\pi}{12}, \frac{55\pi}{12}, \ldots\)
- The solutions from \(x = -\frac{\pi}{12} + 2k\pi\) (case 1) are \(\frac{23\pi}{12}, \frac{47\pi}{12}, \frac{71\pi}{12}, \ldots\)

The

---------------

 solutions in order are:

\[
x_1 = \frac{7\pi}{12}, \quad x_2 = \frac{23\pi}{12}, \quad x_3 = \frac{31\pi}{12}, \quad x_4 = \frac{47\pi}{12}, \quad \ldots
\]

The general formula

---------------

 for the \(n\)-th solution is:
- For odd \(n\): \(x_n = \frac{(12n - 5)\pi}{12}\)
- For even \(n\): \(x_n = \frac{(12n - 1)\pi}{12}\)

Summing the first 20 solutions (

---------------

10 odd and 10 even terms):

\[
\text{Sum} = \sum_{k=1}^{10} \frac{(24k - 17)\pi}{12} + \sum_{k=1}^{10} \frac{(24k - 1)\pi}{12}
\]

Calculating each sum separately:

\[
\text{Sum}_1 = \frac{\pi}{12} \left[24 \sum_{k=1}^{10} k - 17 \cdot 10 \right] = \frac{\pi}{12} [24 \cdot 55 - 170] = \frac{\pi}{12} \cdot 1150
\]

\[
\text{Sum}_2 = \frac{\pi}{12} \left[24 \sum_{k=1}^{10} k - 1 \cdot 10 \right] = \frac{\pi}{12} [24 \cdot 55 - 10] = \frac{\pi}{12} \cdot 1310
\]

Total sum:

\[
\text{Total Sum} = \frac{\pi}{12} (1150 + 1310) = \frac{\pi}{12} \cdot 2460 = 205\pi
\]

Approximating \(205\pi\

---------------

):

\[
205\pi \approx 205 \times 3.1415926535 \approx 644.026
\]

The integer part is:

\[
\boxed{644}
