Okay, let's see. The problem is about a sequence defined by a_{i+1} = 2^{a_i}, and we need to find how many integers n between 1 and 1000 inclusive

---------------

 satisfy that 100 divides a_{1000} - a_1 when starting with a_0 = n. Hmm, so

---------------

 we need 100 divides a_{1000} - a_1. Since a_1 is 2^{a_0}, so

---------------

 a_{1000} - 2^{a_0} must be divisible by 100. 



---------------

First, let's understand the sequence. Starting with a_0 = n, then a_1 = 2^n, a_2 = 2^{2^n}, and so on. Each

---------------

 term is a tower of exponents of 2's, getting huge very quickly. Since we're dealing with modulo 100, maybe we can work

---------------

 modulo 100 for these terms. The key is that a_{1000} mod 100 must

---------------

 equal a_1 mod 100, so that their difference is 0 mod 100. So,

---------------

 the condition is a_{1000} ≡ a_1 mod 100. Since the sequence is

---------------

 defined by exponentiation, perhaps we can find a cycle or periodicity in the exponents modulo φ(100), where

---------------

 φ is Euler's totient function. 

Let me recall Euler's theorem: if a and m are coprime, then a^φ(m) ≡ 1 mod m. Since

---------------

 100 = 2^2 * 5^2, φ(100) = 100*(1 - 1/2)*(1 - 1/5) = 100 * 1/2 * 4/5 = 40. So φ(100) = 40. But

---------------

 since 2 and 100 are not coprime, Euler's theorem doesn't apply directly here. Hmm, so

---------------

 maybe we need to handle modulo 4 and 25 separately, then use the Chinese Remainder Theorem? Since 100 = 4*25,

---------------

 and 4 and 25 are coprime. 

Alternatively, maybe we can compute modulo 4 and modulo 25,

---------------

 then combine the results. Let's try breaking it down. 

First, let's consider modulo 4. Since 100 mod

---------------

 4 is 0, so modulo 4 is part of the modulus. Let's see what a_{1000} -

---------------

 a_1 mod 4 is. 

Compute a_1 mod 4: a_1 = 2^{a_0}. Since

---------------

 a_0 is an integer. 2^k mod 4 cycles every 2. For k ≥ 2, 2^k mod 4 is 0. For

---------------

 k=0, 1; k=1, 2. So if a_0 is 1, then 2^1 mod

---------------

 4 is 2. If a_0 is 2, then 2^2=4 mod4=0. Similarly

---------------

, for a_0 ≥2, 2^{a_0} mod4 is 0. 

Then a_{1000} mod

---------------

4: since each term is 2^{previous term}. Let's see. Let's see the sequence mod4. Starting

---------------

 from a_0 = n. 

a1 = 2^{a0} mod4. As above, if a0 ≥2, then a1 mod4 is

---------------

 0. If a0=1, a1 mod4 is 2. 

Then a2 = 2^{a1} mod4. If

---------------

 a1 mod4 is 0, then a2 mod4 is 0 (since exponent is ≥2). If a1 mod4 is 2, then a

---------------

2 = 2^2 mod4 = 0. So regardless, for a1 ≥2, a2 mod4 is 0. So

---------------

 after the second term, all terms mod4 are 0. 

Therefore, a_{1000} mod4 is 0,

---------------

 except if a0 =1? Let's see. Let me check for a0=1:

a0=1:

---------------

 a1 =2^1=2 mod4. a2=2^2=4 mod4=0, and

---------------

 then all subsequent terms are 0 mod4. So even starting at a0=1, a_{1000} mod4 is 0. 



---------------

Wait, so for any a0, a_{1000} mod4 is 0. 

Then a1 mod4:

---------------

 

If a0 ≥2, then a1 mod4 =0. 

If a0=1, a1 mod4=2. 

Therefore

---------------

, the difference a_{1000} -a1 mod4 is: 

If a0 ≥2: 0 -0 =

---------------

0 mod4. 

If a0=1: 0 -2 = -2 mod4 = 2 mod4. 

Therefore

---------------

, in order to have a_{1000} -a1 ≡0 mod4, we need either a0 ≥

---------------

2 (then it works), or if a0=1, then 2 mod4 ≠0, so it doesn't work. 



---------------

Therefore, modulo4 condition is satisfied when a0 ≠1. But we need to also consider modulo25. 

Now

---------------

, moving on to modulo25. Since 100 =4*25, and we need the difference to

---------------

 be 0 mod25 as well. 

So, the problem reduces to finding n between 1 and 1000 such that a_{1000} ≡ a1 mod25.

---------------

 

To compute a_{1000} mod25, we can use Euler's theorem here since 2 and25 are coprime. φ(25)=20, so 2^20 ≡1 mod25. 



---------------

Therefore, exponents can be considered modulo φ(25)=20, but since exponents themselves are also exponents, this

---------------

 becomes a tower. 

Let me try to formalize this. 

We need to compute a_{1000} mod25. Since

---------------

 a_{k} = 2^{a_{k-1}}, so:

a_{1000} mod25 = 2^{a_{999}} mod25. 

To compute this, since

---------------

 2^20 ≡1 mod25, we can write the exponent a_{999} mod φ(25)=20. 



---------------

Similarly, a_{999} mod20 = 2^{a_{998}} mod20. 

To

---------------

 compute that, we can use φ(20)=8, so 2^8 ≡1 mod20?

---------------

 Wait, 20 is 4*5, φ(20)=φ(4)*φ(5)=2*4=8. 



---------------

But 2 and 20 are not coprime, so Euler's theorem doesn't apply here. Hmm. Let

---------------

 me see. 

Wait, when computing 2^k mod20, perhaps we can compute it directly. Let's see:



---------------

2^1 mod20=2

2^2=4 mod20

2^3=8 mod20

2^4=16 mod20

2^5=32 mod20=12

2^6=24 mod20=4

2

---------------

^7=8 mod20

2^8=16 mod20

2^9=12 mod20



---------------

Hmm, so starting at exponent 2, the cycle is 4,8,16,12,4,8,16,12,... every

---------------

 4 terms. Wait, starting from exponent 2:

Exponent 2:4

3:8

4:16

5:12

6:4 (

---------------

since 2^6 mod20=4). So cycle length is 4. 

Therefore, 2^k mod20 cycles with period 4 starting

---------------

 at exponent 2. 

Therefore, for k ≥2, 2^k mod20 cycles every 4. 



---------------

Thus, to compute a_{999} mod20, which is 2^{a_{998}} mod20. 



---------------

So first, we can note that if a_{998} ≥2, then the exponent a_{998} is

---------------

 ≥2, so 2^{a_{998}} mod20 cycles with period 4. 

Therefore, to

---------------

 compute 2^{a_{998}} mod20, we can compute a_{998} mod4 (

---------------

since the cycle length is 4). 

Wait, but the cycle length is 4, so exponent mod4? Let me see

---------------

:

The cycle is 4,8,16,12 for exponents 2,3,4,5 mod

---------------

4? Let's see:

If exponent is 2 mod4 (since starting from exponent 2):

Wait exponent k=

---------------

2: 2^2 mod20=4

k=3: 8

k=4:16

k=5:12

k=6:4

---------------

 (since exponent 6: 2^6 mod20=4). So exponent 6 is 6 mod4 =2.

---------------

 So exponent mod4=2 gives 4, mod4=3 gives 8, mod4=0 (since 4 mod4=0)

---------------

 gives 16, mod4=1 (5 mod4=1) gives12. 

Therefore, the value

---------------

 of 2^k mod20 depends on k mod4, but shifted. 

So to compute 2^k mod20,

---------------

 for k ≥2, the result is:

If k ≡2 mod4: 4

k≡3 mod4:8

k≡0 mod4 (i.e. 

---------------

4 mod4):16

k≡1 mod4:12

Thus, to compute 2^k mod20, we

---------------

 need to know k mod4. 

Therefore, to compute a_{999} mod20 = 2^{a_{998}} mod20, we need to know

---------------

 a_{998} mod4. 

Similarly, to compute a_{998} mod4, since a_{998} = 2^{a_{997}} mod4. 



---------------

Earlier, we saw that for a term in the sequence beyond the second term, all terms are 0 mod4. Wait

---------------

, let me check again:

Starting from a0, a1 is 2^{a0}, so unless a0=1, a

---------------

1 mod4 is 0. If a0=1, then a1=2 mod4, then a2=

---------------

2^2 mod4=0. So from a2 onwards, all terms are 0 mod4. 

Therefore, for

---------------

 k ≥2, a_k mod4 =0. 

Therefore, a_{998} mod4 =0 (

---------------

since 998 ≥2). 

Therefore, to compute a_{999} mod20 = 2^{a_{998}} mod20.

---------------

 Since a_{998} mod4 is 0 (as a_{998} is 0 mod4),

---------------

 so exponent a_{998} mod4 is 0. Therefore, looking at the earlier pattern, exponent k≡

---------------

0 mod4 gives 16 mod20. So 2^{a_{998}} mod20 =16. 

Therefore

---------------

, a_{999} mod20=16. 

Therefore, going back, a_{1000} mod25 =2^{a_{999}} mod25. Since

---------------

 a_{999} mod20=16 (since φ(25)=20), so 2^{16} mod25. Let me compute that:



---------------

2^10=1024 mod25. 1024 divided by25: 25*40=1000, so 1024-1000=24 mod

---------------

25. So 2^10 ≡24 mod25. 

Then 2^16=2^10 *2^6.

---------------

 2^6=64 mod25=64-2*25=14. So 24*14=336 mod25. 25*13=325, so 336-325=11 mod25. So

---------------

 2^16 ≡11 mod25. 

Therefore, a_{1000} mod25=

---------------

11. 

Wait, so regardless of the starting n (as long as the sequence progresses beyond a1?), a_{1000} mod25 is always 11? Let

---------------

 me check if that's the case. 

Wait, let's see. Let's retrace:

We assumed that a_{998} mod4 is

---------------

 0. Since for any starting n, as long as a_2 is 0 mod4, then all subsequent terms will

---------------

 be 0 mod4. Therefore, for any n ≥1, a_2 is 0 mod4. So even

---------------

 if n=1, a1=2 mod4, a2=2^2=4 mod4=0, so

---------------

 a_2 and beyond are 0 mod4. Therefore, a_{998} mod4=0, so a

---------------

_{999}=2^{a_{998}} mod20=16, so a_{1000}=2^{16} mod25=11. 

Therefore, a

---------------

_{1000} mod25 is always 11, regardless of n? 

Wait, but that can

---------------

't be. Wait, unless the exponent tower is so tall that it's always reducing to the same value mod25?

---------------

 Hmm, maybe so. Let me confirm with an example. Let's take n=2. Then a0=2, a1=4, a2=16 mod4=0, and

---------------

 so on. Then a_{1000} mod25 would be 11. 

If n=3, a

---------------

0=3, a1=8 mod4=0, so a2=2^8 mod4=0, etc

---------------

., so same result. 

Even n=1, a0=1, a1=2 mod4, then a2=4

---------------

 mod4=0, so the rest follow. So yes, regardless of n, a_{1000} mod25 is 11. 

Therefore

---------------

, a_{1000} mod25 is always 11. 

Therefore, the difference a_{1000} -a1 must

---------------

 be ≡ (11 - a1 mod25) mod25. We need this difference ≡0 mod25, so 11 ≡a1 mod25. 

Therefore, the condition reduces

---------------

 to a1 ≡11 mod25. 

Therefore, the problem becomes: find the number of integers n between 1 and 1000 such that 2^{n} ≡11 mod25. 

Therefore

---------------

, we need to solve 2^{n} ≡11 mod25. 

So now, the problem is

---------------

 reduced to solving for n in 1 ≤n ≤1000 where 2^n ≡11 mod25. 

So

---------------

, first, let's find all n such that 2^n ≡11 mod25. 

To solve 2^n ≡11 mod25. Since

---------------

 2 and25 are coprime, we can use Euler's theorem. φ(25)=20, so 2^20≡1 mod25. 



---------------

Therefore, the multiplicative order of 2 modulo25 divides 20. Let's find the order. 

Compute

---------------

 powers of 2 mod25:

2^1=2

2^2=4

2^4=16

2^5=32≡7 mod25

2^10=(2^5)^2≡

---------------

7^2=49≡49-25=24 mod25

2^20=(2^10)^2≡24^2=576≡576-23*25=576-575=1 mod25. 

So

---------------

 the order is indeed 20. 

Therefore, 2 is a primitive root mod25? Wait, since the

---------------

 order is φ(25)=20, so yes, 2 is a primitive root modulo25. 

Therefore, the equation 2^n ≡11 mod25 has a unique solution modulo20.

---------------

 

Therefore, we can write n ≡k mod20, where k is the discrete logarithm of 11 base2 mod25. 

We

---------------

 need to find k such that 2^k ≡11 mod25. Let's compute 2^k mod25 until

---------------

 we find 11. 

Let's compute step by step:

2^1=2

2^2=4

2^3=8

2^4=16

2^5=32 mod

---------------

25=7

2^6=14

2^7=28 mod25=3

2^8=6

2^9=12

2^10=24

2^11=48 mod25=23

2^12=46 mod25=21

2^13=42 mod25=17

2^14=34 mod25=9

2^15=18

2^16=36 mod25=11



---------------

Ah, there we go. 2^16 ≡11 mod25. 

Therefore, k=16. 



---------------

Therefore, the solutions are n ≡16 mod20. 

Therefore, all n such that n ≡16 mod20 will

---------------

 satisfy 2^n ≡11 mod25. 

Therefore, the numbers n between1 and1000 where

---------------

 n ≡16 mod20. 

Now, we need to count how many numbers between1 and1000 inclusive are congruent to16 mod20. 

The numbers

---------------

 are 16,36,56,..., up to the largest number ≤1000. 

Let

---------------

 me compute the first term a=16, common difference d=20. 

The nth term is 16 +20(m

---------------

-1)=20m -4. 

We need 20m -4 ≤1000 =>20m ≤1004 => m ≤1004/20=50.2. So

---------------

 m can be up to50. 

Check for m=50: 20*50 -4=1000-4=996. 



---------------

m=51 would be 20*51 -4=1020-4=1016>1000. 

Therefore

---------------

, there are50 terms. 

Wait, but let me check starting from m=1:

Term1:16=

---------------

16+20*(1-1)=16

Term2:36=16+20*1=36

...

Term50:16+20*(49)=16+980=996. 

Yes

---------------

, so 50 terms. 

But wait, let me count using another method. The numbers congruent to16 mod20 between

---------------

1 and1000. 

The first number is16, the last is996. 

The count

---------------

 is ((last - first)/difference)+1 = ((996-16)/20)+1=(980/20)+1=49 +1=50. 

Therefore

---------------

, 50 numbers. 

However, remember that earlier we had the modulo4 condition. The problem required that 100 divides a

---------------

_{1000}-a1, so both mod4 and mod25 must hold. 

Earlier, we saw

---------------

 that mod4 requires that a0 ≠1. But in the mod25 condition, we found that n must be ≡16 mod20. 



---------------

Wait, but when n=16 mod20, does that exclude n=1? Since 16 mod20≠

---------------

1 mod20. So n=16 mod20 numbers are okay for mod4? 

Wait, let's check

---------------

: the mod4 condition requires that a0 ≠1. But the numbers we're counting are n≡16 mod20. Since

---------------

 16 mod20≠1, so none of them are 1. Therefore, all n≡16 mod20 automatically

---------------

 satisfy the mod4 condition (since they are not 1). 

Therefore, the total numbers are exactly 50. 

Wait, but hold

---------------

 on. Let me confirm if n=1 is included in our count. Since 1 mod20 is 1, which

---------------

 is different from16, so n=1 is excluded. So yes, all the 50 numbers are valid.

---------------

 

Wait, but wait another thing: the problem states "the number of integers 1 ≤n ≤1000".

---------------

 So the answer is 50? Hmm. 

Wait, but let me check again. Let me confirm with n=16:



---------------

If n=16, then a1=2^16. Let's compute a1 mod25. Since

---------------

 2^16 mod25=11 as before, so a1 mod25=11. Then

---------------

 a_{1000} mod25 is also11, so the difference mod25 is0. 



---------------

Mod4: a_{1000} mod4=0, a1=2^16 mod4=0 (since exponent1

---------------

6≥2), so a1 mod4=0. Therefore difference mod4=0. 

Thus, n=16 is good

---------------

. 

Another test case: n=36. 2^36 mod25. Since 36 mod20=16, so 2^36=

---------------

2^(20+16)=2^20*2^16≡1*11 mod25=11. So yes

---------------

, same. 

Similarly, n=16 +20*(m) up to 996, so all

---------------

 those n's satisfy 2^n ≡11 mod25, and mod4 they are okay. 

Therefore, the total

---------------

 numbers are 50. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check n=16. 

Wait, but

---------------

 let me think again: when n=16, a1 =2^16. Let me compute 2^16 mod2

---------------

5. Earlier, we saw 2^16 mod25=11, so that's correct. 

Therefore

---------------

, yes, the count is50. 

Wait, but the problem says "the number of integers 1 ≤n ≤1000".

---------------

 So 50 is the answer? Hmm. 

Wait, but hold on a second. Let me check if n=16 mod

---------------

20 is the only solution. Suppose someone made a mistake in the exponent. Let me retrace solving 2^n ≡11 mod25. 

We found that 2^16 mod

---------------

25=11, so the solution is n≡16 mod20. Since the order is20. So

---------------

 yes, solutions are n≡16 mod20. 

Therefore, the numbers are 16,36,...,996.

---------------

 

Total numbers: (996-16)/20 +1 = (980)/20 +1=49+1=50. 

H

---------------

ence, the answer is50. 

Wait, but the problem says "the number of integers 1 ≤ n ≤1000".

---------------

 So 50? 

Wait, but perhaps I missed something. Let me check n=16+20*50=16+1000=1016,

---------------

 which is over 1000, so the last term is16+20*49=16+980=996, which

---------------

 is correct. 

Wait, but let me check if there are other solutions. Suppose 2^k ≡11 mod25.

---------------

 Since the order is20, the solutions are k≡16 mod20. So only numbers congruent to16 mod20. 



---------------

Therefore, yes, only 50 numbers. 

Wait, but let me check with another exponent. Let's take n=16+

---------------

20=36. 

Compute 2^36 mod25. Since 36 mod20=16, so 

---------------

2^36≡2^16≡11 mod25, correct. 

Similarly, n=56:

---------------

 56 mod20=16, so same. 

Therefore, all those n's will satisfy the condition. 

Therefore

---------------

, the answer should be 50. 

Wait, but the problem says "Find the number of integers 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000 such

---------------

 that if a_0 = n, then 100 divides a_{1000} - a_1".

---------------

 

Wait, so the answer is 50? Hmm, but let me think again. 

Wait, but let me check

---------------

 n=16 mod20, but n can be 16,36,...,996. 



---------------

Wait, 16 to 996 with step20: (996-16)/20 =

---------------

 980/20=49, so 49+1=50 numbers. 

Therefore, yes

---------------

. 

Therefore, the answer is 50. 

Wait, but let me confirm with n=16. 



---------------

If n=16, then a0=16, a1=2^16. 

a_{1000} mod100.

---------------

 Since mod4 and mod25. 

We already know mod4 it's0, mod25 it's11. 



---------------

So 100 divides a_{1000} -a1 requires that a_{1000} ≡a1 mod100. 

Therefore

---------------

, a_{1000} mod25 must equal a1 mod25 and a_{1000} mod4 must

---------------

 equal a1 mod4. 

We have a_{1000} mod25=11, and a1 mod25=11,

---------------

 so that's good. 

a_{1000} mod4=0, and a1 mod4=0

---------------

 (since a0=16, which is ≥2, so a1 mod4=0). 

Thus, yes

---------------

, 0≡0 mod4. 

Therefore, 100 divides the difference. 

Another test case: n=1. 



---------------

a0=1, a1=2^1=2. 

a_{1000} mod4=0, a

---------------

1 mod4=2. 

So mod4 difference is -2 mod4≠0. So n=1 is excluded, which is correct

---------------

. 

Another test case: n=17. 

17 mod20=17≠16, so 

---------------

2^17 mod25. 17 mod20, so exponent 17. 

2^17 mod25=

---------------

2^16*2 mod25=11*2=22 mod25. Not 11, so it

---------------

's excluded. 

Therefore, yes, only numbers congruent to16 mod20. 

Therefore, I think the answer is 50. 

Wait, but hold

---------------

 on. Wait, in the problem statement, the sequence is defined as a_{i+1}=2^{a_i}. 



---------------

Wait, but in the problem statement, a_{i+1}=2^{a_i}, so the first term is a0

---------------

, then a1=2^{a0}, a2=2^{a1}, etc. 

Therefore, when considering

---------------

 a_{1000}, that's 2^{a_{999}}, and so on. 

Therefore, my

---------------

 previous analysis holds. 

Therefore, the answer is 50. 

Wait, but the problem says "the number of integers 1 ≤ n ≤1000". So

---------------

 unless there's an error in my calculation, the answer is 50. 

Wait, but let me check the count

---------------

 again. Let me list some terms:

Start at 16, next 36, 56,... up to 996. 

Number

---------------

 of terms: Let me see how many terms between16 and996 inclusive with step20. 

The formula is ((

---------------

last - first)/step)+1 = ((996-16)/20)+1= (980/20)+1=49+1=50. 

Yes

---------------

, that's correct. 

Alternatively, the numbers can be represented as n=20k +16, where k is

---------------

 from0 to49. 

Because 20*0 +16=16, 20*49 +16=980+16=996. 

Therefore

---------------

, k=0,...,49, so 50 numbers. 

Therefore, the answer is 50. 

Wait

---------------

, but I feel like maybe I made a mistake because 50 seems low, but given the modulus conditions, maybe it

---------------

's correct. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires n such that 2^n ≡11 mod100?

---------------

 Wait no, the problem requires 100 divides a_{1000}-a1, so we split into

---------------

 mod4 and mod25. 

We found that mod25 requires 2^n≡11 mod25, which

---------------

 gives n≡16 mod20. 

Mod4 requires n≠1, which is already satisfied because n≡16 mod20 implies

---------------

 n is 16 mod20, so n mod4=0 (since 16 mod4=0). 



---------------

Wait, hold on. Wait, n≡16 mod20 implies n mod4=0. 

Wait a second,

---------------

 if n≡16 mod20, then n mod4=0. 

Therefore, n must be divisible by4? Because

---------------

 16 mod4=0. 

Wait, so actually n must be ≡0 mod4. 

Wait, but

---------------

 16 mod20 is 0 mod4. 

Therefore, all the n's we are counting are multiples of4 plus

---------------

 16 mod20, which are 0 mod4. 

Wait, so n must be ≡0 mod4.

---------------

 

Wait, but 16 mod20 is 0 mod4. 

Therefore, the numbers n≡16 mod20 are exactly

---------------

 the numbers ≡0 mod4 and ≡16 mod20. 

So, in other words, n≡

---------------

16 mod20 is stricter than just mod4. 

Therefore, all n in the count are divisible by4,

---------------

 so a1=2^n mod4=0, so mod4 is okay. 

Therefore, the count is indeed50. 

Hmm

---------------

, so I think the answer is 50. But let me check with another example. 

Suppose n=16,

---------------

 which is included. 

n=16 mod20. 

Another number, say n=4: 4 mod20=

---------------

4. Then 2^4 mod25=16 mod25. So 16≠11,

---------------

 so not included. 

n=8: 8 mod20=8. 2^8 mod25=256 mod25=256-10*25=6,

---------------

 so 6≠11. 

n=12: 2^12 mod25=4096 mod25. 

---------------

2^10=24 mod25, so 2^12=24*4=96 mod25=21.

---------------

 

21≠11. 

n=16: 2^16 mod25=11,

---------------

 which works. 

So that's correct. 

Therefore, yes, the answer is50. 

Wait, but the

---------------

 problem says "the number of integers 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000". 

Wait, but maybe I missed

---------------

 n=16 + 20*50=1016, but that's over 1000, so the

---------------

 last term is 996. So the count is indeed50. 

Therefore, I think the answer is 

---------------

50. 

**Final Answer**
Answer: 50


To solve the problem, we need to find the number of integers \(1 \le n \le 1000\) such that \(100\) divides \(a_{1000} - a_1\) where the sequence \(a_i\) is defined by \(a_{i+1} = 2^{a_i}\) and \(a_0 = n\).

### Key Steps:

1. **Modulo 4 Analysis**:
   - \(a_1 = 2^n \mod 4\):


---------------

     - If \(n \ge 2\), \(a_1 \equiv 0 \mod 4\).
     - If \(n = 1\), \(a_1 \equiv 2 \mod 4\).
   - For \(i

---------------

 \ge 2\), \(a_i \equiv 0 \mod 4\). Thus, \(a_{1000} \equiv 0 \mod 4\).
   - The

---------------

 condition \(a_{1000} \equiv a_1 \mod 4\) requires \(a_1 \equiv 0 \mod 4\), so

---------------

 \(n \neq 1\).

2. **Modulo 25 Analysis**:
   - Using Euler's theorem, since

---------------

 \(\phi(25) = 20\), we need \(a_{1000} \equiv a_1 \mod 25\).
   - \(a_{1000} \mod 25\) is

---------------

 always \(11\) regardless of \(n\) (computed using properties of exponents modulo 20 and 25).
   - Therefore

---------------

, \(a_1 \equiv 11 \mod 25\), which translates to solving \(2^n \equiv 11 \mod 25\).

3. **Solving \(2^n \equiv 11 \mod 25\)**:
   - The order

---------------

 of 2 modulo 25 is 20. Finding \(k\) such that \(2^k \equiv 11 \mod 25\) gives \(k = 16\).
   - Solutions are \(n \equiv 16 \mod 20\).

4. **Counting Valid \(n\)**:
   - Numbers between 1 and 1000 congruent to 16 modulo 20 are: 16, 36, 56, ..., 996.
   - This forms an arithmetic sequence with first term 16, common difference 20, and last term 996.
   - Number of terms: \(\frac{996 - 16}{20} + 1 = 50\).

### Conclusion:
The number of integers \(1 \le n \le 1000\) that satisfy the condition is \(\boxed{50}\).
