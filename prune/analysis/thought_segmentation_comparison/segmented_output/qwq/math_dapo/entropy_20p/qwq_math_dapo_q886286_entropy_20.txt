Okay, so I need to find all integers n such that both n - 3 and n² + 4 are perfect cubes. Then,

---------------

 I have to sum all those n's. Hmm, let me start by understanding what the problem is asking.

First, a perfect cube is a number that can be written as k³ where k is an integer. So, the

---------------

 problem is saying that there exist integers a and b such that:

n - 3 = a³  
and  
n² + 4 = b³.

So

---------------

, I need to find all integers n where both of these equations hold for some integers a and b. Then, add all those n's together.

Let

---------------

 me see how to approach this. Since n - 3 is a cube, maybe I can express n in terms of a,

---------------

 then substitute into the second equation. Let me try that.

From the first equation, n = a³ + 3. Substitute

---------------

 this into the second equation:

(n)² + 4 = (a³ + 3)² + 4 = b³.

So expanding (a³ + 3)² gives

---------------

 a⁶ + 6a³ + 9. Then adding 4 gives a⁶ + 6a³ + 13. So

---------------

, the equation becomes:

a⁶ + 6a³ + 13 = b³.

Hmm, so now

---------------

 I have an equation in terms of a and b. I need to find integers a and b such that this holds. Since

---------------

 a and b are integers, maybe I can look for small integer values of a and see if the left side becomes a cube?



---------------

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps set up the equation as:

b³ - a⁶ = 6a³ + 13.

Hmm

---------------

, but that might not be helpful. Maybe trying small a values first.

Let me try small integers for a and see if the left

---------------

-hand side becomes a cube.

Let me note that a can be positive or negative. Let me start with a = 0:

If

---------------

 a = 0:

Left side: 0 + 0 + 13 = 13. 13 is not a cube.

---------------

 2³=8, 3³=27. So no.

a = 1:

Left side: 1 + 6 + 13 = 20. 20 is not a cube.



---------------

a = -1:

Left side: (-1)^6 is 1, 6*(-1)^3 = -6. So 1 -6 + 13 = 8. 8 is 2³. Oh

---------------

! Wait, that works. So when a = -1, the left side is 8, which is 2³. Therefore, b would

---------------

 be 2 here. So that gives a solution. Let me note that down.

So when a = -1, then n = a³ + 3 = (-1)^3 + 3 = -1 + 3 = 2. So

---------------

 n = 2 is a possible solution. Let me check:

n - 3 = 2 - 3 = -1, which is (-1)^3, so

---------------

 that's a cube. Then n² + 4 = 4 + 4 = 8, which is 2³. So

---------------

 yes, that works. So n=2 is valid.

Okay, so that's one solution. Let's continue.

a = 2:

Left side: (2)^6 + 6*(2)^3 +13 = 64 + 6*8 +13 = 64 +48 +13 = 125. 125 is 5³. So

---------------

 that's a cube. So b=5 here. So that works.

Therefore, a=2 gives n = (2)^3 + 3 = 8 +3 =11. Let me check n

---------------

=11:

n -3 = 8, which is 2³, okay. n² +4 = 121 +4 =125 =

---------------

5³. Perfect. So n=11 is another solution.

a= -2:

Left side: (-2)^6 +6*(-2)^3 +13 = 64 + 6*(-8) +13 = 64 -48 +13 = 29. 29 is not a cube. 3³ is 27, 4³ is 64. So no.

a=3:

Left side: 3^6 +6*3^3 +13. Let's compute that

---------------

:

3^6 is 729, 6*27 is 162, so total is 729 +162 +13 = 904. Hmm

---------------

, 904. What's the cube near that? 9³ is 729, 10³ is 1000. So 

---------------

904 is between 9³ and 10³. Not a cube.

a= -3:

Left side: (-3)^6 +6*(-3)^3 +13 = 729 + 6*(-27) +13 = 729 -162 +13 = 729 -162 is 567, plus13 is 580. 

---------------

580 is not a cube. 8³ is 512, 9³ is 729. Nope

---------------

.

a=4:

Left side: 4^6 +6*4^3 +13. 4^6 is 4096, 4^3=64, so 6*64=384. So

---------------

 total is 4096 + 384 +13 = 4493. 16³ is 4096, 17³ is 4913. So 

---------------

4493 is between them, not a cube.

a=-4:

Similarly, (-4)^6 is 4096, 6*(-4)^3 =

---------------

 6*(-64)= -384. So 4096 -384 +13 = 4096 -384 is 3712 +13 is

---------------

 3725. 15³=3375, 16³=4096. Not a cube.

Hmm, so

---------------

 maybe going further out won't help? Let's check a=5:

a=5:

a^6=15625, 6a

---------------

^3=6*125=750. So total 15625+750+13=16388. 25³=15625, 26³=17576. So between

---------------

 them, not a cube.

a=-5:

(-5)^6=15625, 6*(-5)^3=6*(-125)= -750. So total 

---------------

15625-750+13=15625-750 is 14875 +13 is 14888. 

---------------

24³ is 13824, 25³=15625. So between them

---------------

, not a cube.

Hmm, maybe a=1:

Wait, we tried a=1 already, which gave 20, which is

---------------

 not a cube. What about a= -2, we saw 29, no. So maybe the only a's that work are a=-1 and a=2?



---------------

Wait, let me check a= -0. Wait, a=0 we already did. Hmm.

Wait, let's check

---------------

 a= maybe 1, but 20 isn't a cube. Let me check a= 3, 904,

---------------

 not a cube. So maybe only a=-1 and a=2. So that gives n=2 and 11.

---------------

 Wait, but let me check a= maybe 6?

Wait, perhaps there's another value? Let me see. Let

---------------

 me check a= maybe fractions? But a must be integer because n -3 is a cube, so a is integer. So only

---------------

 integers.

Wait, perhaps a= maybe a= something else?

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe set up the equation as

---------------

 b³ - a⁶ =6a³ +13. Hmm, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe set variables

---------------

 differently. Let me see.

Alternatively, let me denote x = a³. Then, the equation becomes:

x² + 6x +13 = b³.

So,

---------------

 x² +6x +13 = b³. So, for integer x (since a is integer, x must be a

---------------

 cube, but not necessarily, because x is a³, so x is a cube. Wait, actually, x is a³, so x is

---------------

 a cube, but in this substitution, x is a³. So the equation is (a³)^2 +6a

---------------

³ +13 = b³. Which is the same as before. Hmm, maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps rearr

---------------

ange terms:

b³ = (a³)^2 +6a³ +13. Let me think of this as b

---------------

³ = (a³ + 3)^2 + (13 - 9). Wait, (a³ + 3)^2 is

---------------

 a^6 + 6a³ +9, so adding 4 gives a^6 +6a³ +13. So

---------------

, that's exactly the left side. So, the equation is (a³ +3)^2 +4 = b³. Wait

---------------

, but that's the original equation: n^2 +4 = b³, where n = a³ +3. So that

---------------

's just the substitution again. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps think of this as an equation in integers: find integers a and b such

---------------

 that b³ - (a³ +3)^2 =4. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe try to bound the possible

---------------

 a's? Let's see, for large a, the term a⁶ dominates, so b³ ≈ a⁶, so b ≈ a². Let me see

---------------

:

Suppose that b is approximately a². Let me write b = a² + k, where k is some integer. Then,

---------------

 substituting into the equation:

(a² +k)^3 = a⁶ +6a³ +13.

Expanding left side:

a^6 + 3a^4k + 3a²k² +k³ = a^6 +6a³ +13.

Subtract a^6 from both sides:

3a^4k + 3a²k² +k³ =6a³ +13.

Hmm, this

---------------

 might not be helpful unless k is small. Let me suppose that k is small, say between -2 and 2.

---------------

 Let's try k=1:

Then,

3a^4(1) + 3a²(1)^2 +1^3 = 3a^4 +3a² +1 =6a³ +13

So

---------------

,

3a^4 +3a² +1 -6a³ -13 =0

3a^4 -6a³ +3a² -12 =0

Hmm, not

---------------

 sure. Let's see if there are integer solutions here. Let me try a=2:

3*(16) -6*(8) +3*(4) -12 = 48 -48 +12 -12=0. Wait

---------------

, that gives 0. So when a=2 and k=1, this equation holds. So that gives b = a² +1 =4+1=5, which matches the

---------------

 earlier solution when a=2, b=5. So that works. So that case is covered.

Similarly, trying k= -1:

Then

---------------

, 3a^4*(-1) +3a²*(-1)^2 + (-1)^3 = -3a^4 +3a² -1 =6a³ +13



---------------

So moving everything to left:

-3a^4 +3a² -1 -6a³ -13=0



---------------

-3a^4 -6a³ +3a² -14=0

Hmm, not sure. Let me plug

---------------

 in a=-1:

-3*(1) -6*(-1)^3 +3*(1) -14 =

---------------

 -3 - (-6) +3 -14 = (-3 +6)=3; 3 +3=6; 6-14= -8≠0.

---------------

 Not zero.

a= -2:

-3*(16) -6*(-8) +3*(4) -14 = -48 +48 +12 -14= (-48+48)=0; 12-14= -2≠0.

Hmm.



---------------

What if k=0? Then:

Left side:0 +0 +0 =0, so equation becomes 0 =6a³ +13 →

---------------

 6a³= -13, which is not integer.

k=2:

Then,

3a^4*2 +3a²*(4) +8 =6a^4 +12a² +8 =6a³ +13

Thus

---------------

,

6a^4 +12a² +8 -6a³ -13=0 →6a^4 -6a³ +12a² -5=0



---------------

Hmm, let's try a=1:

6 -6 +12 -5=7≠0.

a=0: 0 -0 +0 -5= -5≠0

a=2:6*(16) -6*(8)+12*(4)-5= 96-48+48-5=91≠0

Not

---------------

 helpful.

k=-2:

Then,

3a^4*(-2) +3a²*(4) + (-8)= -6a^4 +12a² -8 =6a³ +13

Moving

---------------

 all terms left:

-6a^4 -6a³ +12a² -21=0

Hmm

---------------

, testing a=-1:

-6*(-1)^4 -6*(-1)^3 +12*(-1)^2 -21=

---------------

 -6(1) -6*(-1)+12(1)-21= -6 +6 +12 -21= -9≠0.

Hmm

---------------

. So perhaps this approach isn't the best. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the only solutions are the ones we found when

---------------

 a=-1 and a=2. Let's check a= maybe 1, but that didn't work. Let me check

---------------

 a= maybe 4? Wait, tried a=4, which gave 4493, which is not a cube. Hmm

---------------

.

Alternatively, maybe negative a's beyond -1. Let's try a=-4 again. Wait, a=-4 gives

---------------

 3725, which is not a cube. So perhaps those are the only solutions?

Wait, let me check

---------------

 a= -1, 2 gives n=2 and 11. Let me see if there are other possible a's where

---------------

 the equation might hold.

Wait, perhaps a= -2 gives 29. 29 isn't a cube, but

---------------

 maybe negative b? Wait, b³ must equal 29, but 29 is not a cube. So no.

Wait

---------------

, maybe a= 0 gives 13. 13 isn't a cube either. So maybe those are the only two

---------------

 solutions?

Wait, but let me think again. Let me check a= maybe 3 again. 3^6 is 729, plus 6*27=162, so

---------------

 729+162=891, plus 13 is 904. 904 is

---------------

 not a cube. 9.5^3 is like 857, 10^3 is 1000. So

---------------

 no.

Wait, let me check a= maybe 6, just in case. a=6: 6^6 is 46656, 6*

---------------

6^3=6*216=1296. So total is 46656 +1296 +

---------------

13 = 46656+1296=47952 +13=47965. Is

---------------

 that a cube? Let's see, cube of 36 is 36³=46656, 37³=50653. So between them, not

---------------

 a cube.

Hmm. How about a= -6: (-6)^6=46656, 6*(-6)^3=6*(-216)= -1296. So 46656 -1296 +

---------------

13= 46656-1296 is 45360 +13=45373. 

---------------

35³=42875, 36³=46656. So between them, not a cube.

Hmm

---------------

, so maybe only a= -1 and a=2. Therefore, the corresponding n's are 2 and 11. Then

---------------

 the sum would be 2 +11=13. Wait, but let me check if there are other possible a's.

---------------

 Maybe a= some other numbers?

Wait, let me check a= 1 again. 1^6=1, 6*1=6, so

---------------

 1+6+13=20. 20 isn't a cube. a= -3 gives 580,

---------------

 which isn't a cube. How about a= maybe 10? Probably too big, but let me see:

a=10: 10^6 is

---------------

 1,000,000; 6*1000=6000; so

---------------

 total 1,000,000 +6000 +13=1,006,013. Cube

---------------

 of 100 is 1,000,000. 100³=1e6, 101³=1,030,301. So between

---------------

 those, so not a cube.

Hmm, so maybe only two solutions. But let me think again: perhaps there are other

---------------

 solutions where a is larger negative?

Wait, a= -2 gives 29, not a cube. a= -5

---------------

 gives 14888, which is between 24³=13824 and 25³=15625, so

---------------

 no. a= -7: Let's see:

a=-7: (-7)^6=117649, 6*(-7)^3=6*(-343)= -2058. So total is

---------------

 117649 -2058 +13 = 117649 -2058 =

---------------

 115591 +13=115604. 48³ is 110592, 49³=117649. So between them

---------------

, not a cube.

Hmm, so I think maybe only a=-1 and a=2. Therefore n=2 and n=11. Their

---------------

 sum is 13. But wait, let me check if there are other solutions where maybe a is not an integer? Wait, but

---------------

 a must be an integer because n-3 is a cube, so a is cube root of (n-3). Since n is integer, a

---------------

 must be integer. So a must be integer. So I think those are the only two solutions.

Wait, hold on,

---------------

 let me think again. Let me check a= maybe a= -1 gives n=2, which works, a=2 gives n=11.

---------------

 Let me see if there's another a where the left side is a cube. Let me think of cubes near the expressions.

---------------

 Let me think of b³ = (a³)^2 +6a³ +13. Let me see for a

---------------

= -1, 2, maybe a= maybe some other value?

Wait, let me see when a= -2:

---------------

 64 - 48 +13=29. Not a cube. a= -1 gives 1 -6 +13=8.

---------------

 a=0 gives 13, a=1 gives 20, a=2 gives 125,

---------------

 a=3 gives 904, which is not a cube.

Wait, let me check a= maybe a= -

---------------

4 gives 64 - 384 +13? Wait, no, wait when a= -2,

---------------

 the calculation was:

Wait, actually, let me recast. For a general a:

Left side is a^6 +6a^3 +13. So

---------------

 for a= -2, that's (-2)^6 +6*(-2)^3 +13 = 64 +6*(-8)+13 = 64-48+13=29.

---------------

 Yes, that's correct.

Wait, a= -1 gives 1 + (-6) +13=8.

---------------

 So that's 8, which is 2³. So that works.

a=2 gives 64 + 6*8 +13 = 64+48+13=125,

---------------

 which is 5³. So that works.

Hmm, so perhaps only two solutions. Therefore the answer is 2+11=13.

---------------

 But wait, let me check if there are other possible a's where this might hold. For example, a= maybe 

---------------

3, but 904 is not a cube. Let me see 904 divided by 2 is 452, 

---------------

452 divided by 2 is 226, divided by 2 is 113. So prime

---------------

 factors 2^3 *113. Not a cube.

Alternatively, maybe a= -3 gives 729 +6*(-27)=

---------------

729-162=567 +13=580. 580 factors into

---------------

 4*145=4*5*29. Not a cube. So no.

Alternatively, maybe a

---------------

= maybe 10? No, as before. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another solution where a is a larger

---------------

 number? Let me see, but as a increases, the left side a^6 grows much faster than b³. Wait

---------------

, but since b³ = a^6 + ... So b is roughly a². So the difference between (a²)^3 and a

---------------

^6 is zero, but the other terms are 6a³ +13. So maybe for larger a, the

---------------

 difference between b and a² would be small. Let's suppose that b = a² +k where k is small.

---------------

 Wait, like before.

Suppose that b = a² + k, where k is small integer, then:

b³ = (a² +k)^3 = a^6 + 3a^4k + 3a²k² +k³.



---------------

Set equal to a^6 +6a³ +13:

So, 3a^4k + 3a²k² +k³ =6a³ +13.

This

---------------

 equation must hold for some integer k. Let's rearrange:

3a^4k -6a³ + 3a²k² -13 +k³=0.

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 trying k=1 again:

3a^4(1) -6a³ +3a²(1) -13 +1= 3a^4 -6a³ +3a² -12=0.



---------------

Wait, this is the same as before. For a=2, this gives 3*16 -6*8 +3*4 -12 = 48-48+12-12=0. So that

---------------

 works. Any other a?

Let me see if a=1: 3 -6 +3 -12 = -12≠

---------------

0.

a=0: 0 -0 +0 -12= -12≠0.

a=3: 3*81 -6*27 +3*9 -12 = 243 -162 +27 -12= 96≠

---------------

0.

Hmm, so only a=2 here. What about k= -1?

Then, substituting k=-1 into

---------------

 the equation:

3a^4*(-1) -6a³ +3a²*(-1)^2 -13 + (-1)^3 =



---------------

-3a^4 -6a³ +3a² -13 -1 =

-3a^4 -6a³ +3a² -14 =0.

Hmm

---------------

, let me see if there are any integer solutions here. Let me try a= -1:

-3*(-1)^4 -6*(-1)^3 +3*(-1)^2 -14 =

---------------

 -3(1) -6*(-1)+3(1) -14 = -3+6+3-14= -8≠0.

a= -2:

-3*(16) -6*(-8) +3*(4) -14 = -48 +48 +12 -14= (-48+48)=0,

---------------

 12-14= -2≠0.

Hmm, no. Maybe a=?

Not sure. Let's try

---------------

 a= maybe 3?

-3*(81) -6*(27) +3*(9) -14 = -243 -162 +27 -14= -

---------------

402 +27= -375 -14= -389≠0.

Not helpful. So

---------------

 maybe no solutions here.

Trying k=2:

Then, with k=2:

3a^4(2) -6a³ +3a²(4) -13 +8 =

---------------

6a^4 -6a³ +12a² -5=0.

Trying a=1: 6 -6 +12 -5=7≠0.

a=0: 0 -0 +0 -5= -5≠0.

a=2

---------------

: 6*(16) -6*8 +12*4 -5= 96-48+48-5=91≠0.

Hmm

---------------

, nothing.

Alternatively, trying k=3:

Wait, this might get too complicated. Let me think of another approach.

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 the equation b³ - a^6 =6a³ +13.

We can think of this as b³ = a^6 +6a³ +13.

Looking

---------------

 for integer solutions. Let me note that when a is large, the term a^6 dominates, so b must be roughly

---------------

 a², as before. Let me set b = a² +k, where k is small. We saw for k=1,

---------------

 when a=2, it works. Let's see for k=2 and a=?

Suppose that k=2

---------------

, then:

b =a² +2,

so,

(a² +2)^3 =a^6 +6a^5

---------------

 +12a^4 +8.

Wait, no, expanding (a² +2)^3:

= a^6 + 3a

---------------

^4*2 + 3a²*(2)^2 + 8 = a^6 +6a^4 +12a² +8.

Set equal to a^6 +6a³ +13,



---------------

so:

6a^4 +12a² +8 =6a³ +13,

then,

6a^4 -6a³ +12a² -5 =0.

Which

---------------

 is same as above. Not helpful.

Alternatively, let me try k= -1:

b = a² -1,

then,

(a² -1)^3 = a^6 -3a^4 +3a² -1.

Set equal to a^6 +6a³ +13,

so,

-3a^4 +3a² -1 =6a³ +13,

thus

---------------

,

-3a^4 -6a³ +3a² -14 =0,

which is the same equation as before

---------------

, which didn't have solutions except maybe a=-1 or something, but didn't work.

Hmm, so perhaps the only solution

---------------

 is when k=1 and a=2, and when k=?

Wait, let me check a= maybe -2 with

---------------

 k=?

Wait, for a=-1, then b=2. Let me see if that can be represented as a

---------------

² +k. a=-1, so a²=1, so b=2=1 +1, so k=1.

---------------

 So that's the same as the previous case. So indeed, when a=-1, b= (a²)+1=

---------------

2. So the same k=1. So that suggests that the only solutions come from k=1, and a=2 and a=-1.

---------------

 Since when a=-1, a²=1, so b=2=1+1. So k=1.

---------------

 So that's why both solutions come from the same k=1 case.

Therefore, perhaps those are the only two solutions.



---------------

Wait, but let me check for a= maybe 1/2? No, a must be integer. So I think the

---------------

 only solutions are n=2 and n=11. So their sum is 13.

Wait, but wait a

---------------

 second. Let me check if there are other a's where the left-hand side is a cube. Let me see, perhaps

---------------

 a= maybe -2 gives 29, which is not a cube, but maybe negative b?

Wait, 29 is positive, so b would

---------------

 have to be positive. So no. a= -3 gives 580, not a cube. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 a= some other number where the expression is a negative cube?

Wait, let me see. Suppose that b is negative. For

---------------

 instance, if a is such that the left side is negative, then b could be negative.

Let me see, for example, a

---------------

= -2 gives 29, which is positive. a= -3 gives 580, positive. a

---------------

= -4 gives 3725, positive. So even for negative a, the left side is positive. So

---------------

 b must be positive. So no negative cubes here.

Alternatively, when a is such that a^6 +6a^3 +13 is negative. Let

---------------

 me see when is that?

a^6 is always non-negative. 6a^3 can be negative if a is negative. So let

---------------

 me see when a^6 +6a^3 +13 <0.

Let me set a negative integer. Let me see

---------------

:

Let me try a= -2:

(-2)^6 +6*(-2)^3 +13 =64 -48 +13=29>0.

a= -3:

729 - 162 +13= 580>0.

a= -4: 4096 - 384 +13= 3725>0.

a

---------------

= -5: 15625 - 750 +13= 14888>0.

Even

---------------

 for a= -10, a^6 is 1e6, 6a^3 is -6000, so total

---------------

 is 1,000,000 -6,000 +13= 994,013>

---------------

0.

So, the left side is always positive, so b has to be a positive integer. Therefore, only positive cubes to

---------------

 consider.

Therefore, I think the only solutions are a=-1 and a=2, leading to n=2 and n=11, so

---------------

 their sum is 13.

Wait, but let me check if there's another possible a where a^6 +6a^3 +13 is a cube. Let me think

---------------

 of small a's again. a=1 gives 20, not a cube. a= -0 gives 13, not

---------------

 a cube. a= maybe 4 gives 4096 + 6*64 +13= 4096 + 384 +13=4493. Let

---------------

 me see 16³ is 4096, 17³ is 4913, so between

---------------

 them. Not a cube.

Wait, perhaps a= maybe 3: 729 + 162 +13= 904. 

---------------

9.5³ is like 857. 10³ is 1000. So no.

Hmm

---------------

, so I think that's it. So the answer is 2+11=13. Wait, but let

---------------

 me check once more. Let me see if there is a case where a= maybe 0. Wait, a=0 gives n=3. Then

---------------

, n^2 +4=9+4=13, which isn't a cube. So no. So yeah

---------------

, 2 and 11 are the only ones.

Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check a= maybe 

---------------

10, but that's too big. Wait, but let's see a= maybe 5: 5^6 is 15625, plus 6*125=750, so

---------------

 total 15625+750=16375 +13=16388. 

---------------

25³ is 15625, 26³ is 17576. Not a cube. So

---------------

 no.

Hmm, I think that's all. Therefore, the sum is 13.

**Final Answer**
Answer: 13


To solve the problem, we need to find all integers \( n \) such that both \( n - 3 \) and \( n^2 + 4 \) are perfect cubes. 

First, we express \( n \) in terms of an integer \( a \) such that \( n - 3 = a^3 \). This gives \( n = a^3 + 3 \). Substituting this into the second equation \( n^2 + 4 = b^3 \), we get:
\[
(a^3 + 3)^2 + 4 = b^3
\]
Expanding and simplifying, we have:
\[
a^6 + 6a^3 + 13 = b^3
\]

We then

---------------

 test small integer values of \( a \) to find solutions:

- For \( a = -1 \):
  \[
  (-1)^6 + 6(-1)^3 + 13 = 1 - 6 + 13 = 8 = 2^3
  \]
  This gives \( n = (-1)^3 + 3 = 2 \).

- For \( a = 2 \):
  \[
  2^6 + 6(2)^3 + 13 = 64 + 48 + 13 = 125 = 5^3
  \]
  This gives \( n = 2^3 + 3 = 11 \).

Testing other values of \( a \) (both positive and negative) shows that they do not yield perfect cubes for the expression \( a^6 + 6a^3 + 13 \).

Thus, the valid solutions

---------------

 for \( n \) are 2 and 11. Summing these values gives:
\[
2 + 11 = 13
\]
