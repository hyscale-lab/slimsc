Alright, so I need to solve this problem about finding the minimum possible value of the sum of |y_n - 1| + |y_n + 1| for 24 distinct integer points y_1 to y_{24}. The catch

---------------

 is that for each k from 1 to 12, y_{2k-1} is the reflection of y_{2k} across the point x =

---------------

 10. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's recall what reflection across a point means. If y

---------------

_{2k-1} is the reflection of y_{2k} across x = 10, then the midpoint between y_{2k-1} and y_{2k} should be 10. So,

---------------

 mathematically, that would mean (y_{2k-1} + y_{2k}) / 2 = 10. Therefore

---------------

, y_{2k} = 20 - y_{2k-1}. So each pair (y_{2k-1}, y_{2k}) adds up to 20. That's an important point

---------------

. So each pair of points must sum to 20, and they are distinct integers. Since all the y's are

---------------

 distinct, that means for each k, y_{2k-1} ≠ y_{2k}, but since they are reflections, they

---------------

 can't be the same unless they are both 10, but since they have to be distinct, they can't both be 10. So each

---------------

 pair is two distinct integers that add to 20.

So, the 24 points are formed by 12 such pairs. Each

---------------

 pair contributes two numbers that add to 20. Since all 24 points must be distinct integers, none of the pairs can overlap

---------------

 with each other. So, for example, if one pair is (a, 20 - a), another pair can't have

---------------

 either a or 20 - a again. So all the pairs must consist of distinct numbers not used in other pairs.

Our

---------------

 goal is to choose these 12 pairs such that when we compute the sum over all 24 points of (|y_n - 1| + |y_n + 1|), this

---------------

 total is minimized.

First, let me think about the expression |y - 1| + |y + 1|. Maybe I

---------------

 can simplify this expression for a general y. Let's see:

The expression |y - 1| + |y + 1|. Let me consider different cases for y.

Case 1: y >= 1. Then |y - 1| = y - 1, and |y + 1| = y + 1. So the

---------------

 sum is (y - 1) + (y + 1) = 2y. So for y >=1, the expression is 2y.

Case 2: -1 <= y < 1. Here

---------------

, |y - 1| = 1 - y, and |y + 1| = y + 1. So

---------------

 sum is (1 - y) + (y + 1) = 2. So between -1 and 1, the expression is always

---------------

 2.

Case 3: y < -1. Then |y - 1| = -(y - 1) = -y +1, and |y +1| = -(y +1). So the

---------------

 sum is (-y +1) + (-y -1) = -2y. So for y < -1, the expression is -2y.

So summar

---------------

izing:

If y <= -1, then the expression is -2y when y < -1, but at y = -1, it's

---------------

 2. Wait, actually, let's check at y = -1:

At y = -1: | -1 -1 | + | -1 +1 | = | -2 | + | 0 | = 2 + 0 = 2. Similarly

---------------

, at y = 0: | -1 | + |1| = 1 + 1 = 2. So actually

---------------

, the expression is 2 when -1 <= y <=1, 2y when y >1, and -2y when y < -1.

Therefore, the expression |y -1| + |y +1| is

---------------

 minimized when y is between -1 and 1, where it's always 2, and it increases linearly as you

---------------

 move away from that interval.

Therefore, to minimize the total sum, we want as many of the y_n as possible to be in the interval [-1, 1], because

---------------

 that's where the expression is smallest (2). However, since all the y_n must be integers, the possible values in

---------------

 that interval are -1, 0, 1. But each of these can only be used once because the points have

---------------

 to be distinct. Since there are 24 points, we can have at most three of them in [-1, 1], but

---------------

 since each pair has to sum to 20, we can't have both a number and its complement (since 20 - (-

---------------

1) =21, which is not in the interval, etc.) So perhaps we need to see how to arrange the

---------------

 pairs so that as many as possible of the points are near -1, 0, 1? But maybe that's not possible

---------------

 because of the reflection requirement.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal total sum is achieved when the points are as close as possible to the

---------------

 interval [-1,1], but arranged in pairs that sum to 20. Let me think.

First, note that each

---------------

 pair (a, 20 -a) must be two distinct integers. To have their points as close to the interval [-1,1] as possible, perhaps

---------------

 we can have pairs where a is as close to the interval as possible, but their reflections 20 - a would then be on

---------------

 the other side of 10.

Wait, but if we want a pair (a, 20 -a), the

---------------

 distance from a to the interval [-1,1] and the distance from 20 -a to the interval would depend

---------------

 on a. Since reflections are symmetric around 10, so if a is to the left of 10, then

---------------

 20 -a is to the right of 10. So to minimize the total sum, maybe we can have

---------------

 pairs where one is as close as possible to the interval [-1,1], but then the other would be far away,

---------------

 which might not be helpful. Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't the best.

Alternatively, maybe we can model the total sum over

---------------

 all pairs. Since each pair (a, 20 -a) contributes (|a -1| + |a +1|) + (|20 -a -1| + |20 -a +1|). Let's compute that expression

---------------

 for a pair. Let me denote for a given a:

Term1 = |a -1| + |a +1|

Term2 = |(20 -a) -1| + |(20 -a) +1| = |19 -a| + |21 -a|

So the total for the pair is Term1 + Term2.

Therefore

---------------

, if I can compute Term1 + Term2 in terms of a, maybe I can find the value of a that minimizes this total

---------------

 for the pair, and then choose such a's to form the pairs, making sure all numbers are distinct.

So let's compute

---------------

 Term1 + Term2 as a function of a.

First, let's note that Term1 + Term2 = (|a -1| + |a +1|) + (|19 -a| + |21 -a|)



---------------

Let me consider different ranges for a where the expressions inside the absolute values change their behavior.

The critical points for the absolute value expressions

---------------

 are at a = -1, 1, 19, 21. So we can break down the real

---------------

 line into intervals based on these points:

1. a < -1

2. -1 ≤ a < 1

3. 1 ≤ a < 19

4. 19 ≤ a < 21

5. a ≥ 21

Let

---------------

 me compute Term1 + Term2 in each interval.

Case 1: a < -1

Then:

|a -1| = -(a -1) = -a +1

|a +1| = -(a +1)

So

---------------

 Term1 = (-a +1) + (-a -1) = -2a

Similarly,

|19 -a|: Since a < -1 <19, so 19 -a is positive, so |

---------------

19 -a| = 19 -a

|21 -a|: Similarly, 21 -a is positive, so |21 -a| = 21 -a

Thus

---------------

, Term2 = (19 -a) + (21 -a) = 40 - 2a

Total

---------------

 for the pair: (-2a) + (40 - 2a) = 40 -4a

Since

---------------

 a < -1, so -4a is positive, so the total is 40 -4a, which is

---------------

 greater than 40 -4*(-1) = 44? Wait, actually, when a is more negative, -

---------------

4a becomes larger, so the total increases as a decreases. So the minimum in this interval would be when a approaches -infinity

---------------

? But since a has to be integer, but we can't go too far because we need to pair with 20 -a.

---------------

 Wait, but actually, the problem is that a has to be part of a pair, so 20 -a must

---------------

 also be an integer. But we can choose a as any integer except those already used, but perhaps the minimal total here is

---------------

 when a is as large as possible in this interval, i.e., approaching -1 from the left. So at a = -2,

---------------

 for example:

At a = -2,

Total would be 40 -4*(-2) = 40 +8 =48.



---------------

Wait, but let me check:

Term1 for a=-2: | -2 -1 | + | -2 +1 | = 3 +1 =4



---------------

Term2 for a=-2 (so 20 -a =22):

|22 -1| + |22 +1| =21 +23=44,

---------------

 so total 4 +44=48. Correct. So for a=-2, the pair contributes 48.

Case

---------------

 2: -1 ≤ a <1

Here, Term1 is 2, as we saw before. Because for

---------------

 a between -1 and 1, the first expression is 2. So Term1 =2.

Term2 is still

---------------

 |19 -a| + |21 -a|. Since a is between -1 and1, so 19 -a is between

---------------

 18 and 20, so positive, and 21 -a is between 20 and22, also

---------------

 positive. Thus,

Term2 = (19 -a) + (21 -a) = 40 - 2a

Thus

---------------

, the total is 2 + (40 - 2a) =42 - 2a

Since a is between -1 and1, so

---------------

 when a is at its maximum (a approaching 1 from below), the total is 42 -2*(1) =40,

---------------

 and when a is at its minimum (a approaching -1 from above), the total is 42 -2*(-1)=44. So

---------------

 the minimal total in this interval is 40 (approaching a=1). However, since a must be integer,

---------------

 in this interval, the possible integer a's are 0 and -0? Wait, integers between -1 and1 are

---------------

 0 and -1? Wait, since the interval is -1 ≤a <1, so integers are -1, 0. Wait

---------------

, but when a is exactly -1 or 0 or 1?

Wait, let me clarify:

The interval is -1 ≤ a <1, so integers

---------------

 in this interval are -1, 0. Because 1 is excluded.

Wait, but a can be exactly -1,

---------------

 but in that case, since a is in the interval, so:

If a is exactly -1, then since -1 is included in

---------------

 this interval, so:

At a = -1,

Term1 = | -1 -1 | + | -1 +1 | = 2 +0 =2 (

---------------

matches the interval's term1=2).

Term2 would be |19 - (-1)| + |21 - (-1)| = |20| + |22| =20 +22=42.

---------------

 So total is 2 +42=44.

At a =0,

Term1 =2,

Term2 =

---------------

 |19 -0| + |21 -0| =19 +21=40, so total 

---------------

2+40=42.

At a approaching 1 from below (but a must be integer, so a=0 is the closest).

---------------

 So the minimal in this interval is 42 when a=0. However, a=1 is not included here,

---------------

 but in the next interval.

Case 3: 1 ≤ a <19

Here, Term1 = |a -1| + |a +1|. Since a ≥

---------------

1, |a -1|=a -1, and |a +1|=a +1. Thus Term1 = (a -1) + (a +1)=2a.

Term2 =

---------------

 |19 -a| + |21 -a|. Since a is between 1 and19, 19 -a is non-negative (since

---------------

 a <19), and 21 -a is positive (since a <19 <21). So:



---------------

Term2 = (19 -a) + (21 -a) = 40 -2a.

Therefore

---------------

, total for the pair is 2a + (40 -2a) =40. So this is constant 

---------------

40 for all a in this interval. Interesting! So for any a between 1 and 19 (not including 19), the total contribution

---------------

 of the pair is 40. That's a key point.

Case4: 19 ≤ a <21

Here, Term1 is

---------------

 2a (since a ≥1, so same as previous case). But let's check:

Wait, a is between 19 and21,

---------------

 so a is still greater than 1, so Term1 is still 2a. 

Term2: |19 -a| + |21 -a|. Since

---------------

 19 ≤a <21,

|19 -a| = a -19,

|21 -a| =21 -a,



---------------

Thus Term2 = (a -19) + (21 -a) =2.

Therefore, the total for

---------------

 the pair is 2a +2.

Since a is between 19 and21 (but a is integer,

---------------

 so 19 or20):

At a=19,

Total is 2*19 +2=3

---------------

8 +2=40.

At a=20,

Total is 2*20 +2=40 +2=42.

Wait

---------------

, but a=20 is included in this interval (since 19 ≤a <21). But 20 is allowed

---------------

. Wait, but a=20 would pair with 20 -a =0, right? Because the pair is (a,20 -a). So

---------------

 if a=20, then 20 -20=0. But 0 is already considered in case2.

---------------

 Hmm, but need to ensure that all pairs are distinct.

But let's see for the total:

At a=19,



---------------

Total contribution is 2*19 +2 =40, same as the previous interval.

At a=20,

Total contribution is 42.



---------------

So in this interval, the minimal contribution is 40 at a=19.

Case5: a ≥21

Then

---------------

 Term1 is |a -1| + |a +1|. Since a ≥21, both terms are positive,

---------------

 so Term1 = (a -1)+(a +1)=2a.

Term2 = |19 -a| + |21 -a|. Since a ≥21,

|19 -a|=a -19,

|21 -a|=a -21,

Thus Term2 = (a -19) + (a -21)=2a -40.

Thus

---------------

 total is 2a + (2a -40)=4a -40.

Since a ≥21, this

---------------

 is 4*21 -40=84-40=44 when a=21, and increases as a increases. So the

---------------

 minimal here is 44 at a=21.

So summarizing all cases:

- For a < -1: total

---------------

 is 40 -4a, which is minimized when a is as large as possible (closest to -1), so

---------------

 at a=-2 gives 48, but actually the minimal in this interval is when a approaches -1 from left, but

---------------

 a must be integer. So a=-2 gives 48, which is higher than other intervals.

- For -1 ≤a <1 (int

---------------

egers -1,0): the total is 42 (at a=0) or 44 (at a=-1).

---------------

 The minimal here is 42.

- For 1 ≤a <19 (integers 1 through 18): total

---------------

 is always 40.

- For 19 ≤a <21 (integers 19,20): total is 40 (at

---------------

 a=19) or 42 (at a=20).

- For a ≥21 (a=21,

---------------

22,...): total is 4a-40, starting at 44 when a=21.

Therefore, the minimal total

---------------

 contribution per pair is 40, which occurs when a is in [1,19], excluding 19?

---------------

 Wait, no, even at a=19, the total is still 40. Wait in case4, at

---------------

 a=19, it's 40, so actually from a=1 to a=19 inclusive, the total is 40.

---------------

 Because:

Wait for a=19, which is in case4, the total is 40. So actually,

---------------

 the interval 1 ≤a ≤19 (since a=19 is allowed here). So the minimal contribution per pair is 40, achieved

---------------

 for a from 1 to19 inclusive.

Therefore, to get the minimal total sum, we want as many pairs as possible to have their a in the

---------------

 range 1 to19 so that each contributes 40. However, since we have 12 pairs, each

---------------

 contributing 40 would give a total of 12*40=480. But we need to check if this

---------------

 is possible, given the constraints of distinct integers.

Wait, but each pair (a,20 -a) must consist of distinct integers, and all 24 points must be distinct. So we

---------------

 need to select 12 distinct pairs (a_i, 20 -a_i) such that all a_i and 20 -a_i are distinct integers.

---------------

 Since each pair (a,20 -a) are distinct as long as a ≠10, which they are because

---------------

 a is between 1 and19 (so 20 -a would be between 1 and19 as well?

---------------

 Wait, no:

Wait if a is between 1 and19, then 20 -a is between 1 and19 as

---------------

 well? Let's see:

If a is 1, then 20 -a =19.

If a is 2, then 20 -a=18,

---------------

 etc., up to a=10, which would give 20 -10=10, but since a

---------------

 must be different from 20 -a (they have to be distinct points), so a cannot be 10. Therefore

---------------

, the pairs (a,20 -a) for a from 1 to19, excluding 10, would

---------------

 give pairs where each pair sums to 20 and the two elements are distinct. However, note that when a is from

---------------

 1 to9, the pairs are (1,19), (2,18), ..., (9,11). Then (

---------------

10,10) is invalid, so we can't use a=10. Then from a=11 to19, those

---------------

 would pair with 9 down to1, so those are the same pairs as before. So actually, there are 9 pairs

---------------

 from 1-9 and their counterparts 19-11. Then to get 12 pairs, we need 

---------------

3 more pairs. 

Wait, so if we use a from 1 to19 (excluding 10), that

---------------

 gives us 19 -1 =18 numbers, but paired as 9 pairs. So 9 pairs. To

---------------

 get 12 pairs, we need 3 more pairs. So we have to go outside the 1-19 range for

---------------

 the remaining pairs, which would mean that their contribution would be higher than 40.

Alternatively, maybe we can include a

---------------

=0 and a=20, but let's see.

Wait, the pairs can include numbers outside 1 to19 as

---------------

 long as they are reflections around 10, but their total contribution would be higher. For example, if we take a=0, then the pair is (0,20). The total contribution would

---------------

 be 42 (as computed earlier for a=0). Similarly, a=20 gives (20,0), same

---------------

 as above. Similarly, a=-1 gives (-1,21), which contributes 44, etc.

Therefore, if

---------------

 we use 9 pairs within 1-19 (each contributing 40) and 3 more pairs outside,

---------------

 which would contribute more. Let's see what's the minimal total.

Suppose we need 12 pairs. The first

---------------

 9 pairs can be (1,19), (2,18), ..., (9,11) each

---------------

 contributing 40. Then we need 3 more pairs. To minimize the total, we should choose the next best possible

---------------

 pairs, which would be those contributing the least. The next best contributions are 40 (if possible), but since we

---------------

 have already used all a from1 to19 except 10. Wait, 10 can't be used because

---------------

 it would pair with itself. So the remaining numbers outside 1-19 would have to be used. So the next best

---------------

 is a=0 and 20, which gives a total of 42 per pair. Similarly, a= -1 and 21 would

---------------

 give 44, which is worse.

Therefore, to get the minimal total, we should take the next pairs as (0,20), (

---------------

20,0) but wait, but they are the same pair. Since we need distinct points. Wait, the pair (0,20) is one pair.

---------------

 Similarly, if we take a=0, then the pair is (0,20). Then another pair could be ( -

---------------

1,21), but that's 44, but perhaps there are other options?

Wait, let's see:

---------------

 To get three more pairs beyond the 9 pairs in the 1-19 range, we have to pick pairs outside

---------------

. The minimal contribution per pair beyond the 40 is 42 (for a=0 or a=20)

---------------

 or 44 (for a=-1 or 21) or higher. So to minimize the total, we need

---------------

 to use as many as possible of the pairs contributing 42, then 44, etc.

So the minimal would

---------------

 be to have three pairs each contributing 42, so adding 3*42 = 126, plus

---------------

 the 9*40=360, total 360+126=486.

Alternatively

---------------

, can we find other pairs that contribute 40? Let me check if there are other a's that can give 40?



---------------

Wait, for a=19, the pair is (19,1). Wait, but (19,1) is already included

---------------

 in the first set as (1,19). So we can't use it again. Similarly, a=20 would

---------------

 pair with 0, which is a new pair.

Alternatively, is there another a outside 1-19 that can

---------------

 give a total of 40?

Looking back at the cases:

In case3, the total was 40 for a between 1 and19. So

---------------

 to get 40, the a must be in that interval. Therefore, the only way to get 40 is to

---------------

 have the pair within 1-19. So no other pairs outside can contribute 40. Hence, the minimal

---------------

 beyond that is 42. So if we have to take 3 more pairs, each contributing 42, then

---------------

 the total would be 9*40 + 3*42 = 360 +126=486.

Wait

---------------

, but can we use a=10? But a=10 would pair with itself, but they have to be distinct,

---------------

 so that's invalid. So no. Alternatively, are there other pairs?

Wait, maybe using a=20 and 

---------------

0, that's one pair. Then, can we have a= -0? No, same as 0. Alternatively

---------------

, maybe using a= 21 and -1? That would be another pair contributing 44. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 there's a smarter way to choose the pairs so that some pairs outside 1-19 can be arranged to have lower contributions

---------------

? Wait, let me see.

Wait, for example, if a=10 is excluded, but maybe some other a

---------------

's?

Wait, perhaps I made an error in considering the pairs. Let me think again.

The problem states that all 24 points must be distinct integers. So

---------------

 when choosing pairs (a,20 -a), each of these must not have been used in another pair.

So,

---------------

 if we take the first 9 pairs as (1,19), (2,18), ..., (9,11), that

---------------

 uses up the numbers 1 through19 except 10, but actually, each pair uses two numbers, so total

---------------

 numbers used in these 9 pairs are 1,2,...,9 and 11,...,19. So numbers

---------------

 from 1-9 and 11-19, which is 18 numbers, leaving out 10,

---------------

0, -1, -2,... and 20,21, etc.

Thus, to get the remaining 6 numbers (since 24 total,

---------------

 18 already used), we need three more pairs. The minimal contribution would be to take the next closest pairs to the 

---------------

1-19 range.

The closest numbers are 0 and20. So pair (0,20) contributing

---------------

 42. Then next would be (-1,21), which contributes 44. Then maybe ( -2,22)

---------------

 contributing 48, but that's worse. Alternatively, maybe (21, -1) is same as (-1,21). So

---------------

 if we take three pairs: (0,20), (-1,21), and ( -2,22),

---------------

 then their contributions are 42,44,48. Total would be 42+44+48=134, leading

---------------

 to total sum 9*40 + 134= 360 +134=494.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe there are other pairs with lower contributions? Let me see:

Suppose instead of going to negative numbers, can

---------------

 we go higher? For example, a=20 pairs with 0, which we already considered. a=21 pairs with -1,

---------------

 which is 44. a=22 pairs with -2, 48. a=23 pairs with -3, which

---------------

 would be 52, etc. So they get worse as we go further.

Alternatively, can we use a= 10?

---------------

 But 10 pairs with itself, which is invalid. So no.

Alternatively, can we use a= 19.

---------------

5? No, because they have to be integers.

Alternatively, is there a way to have some overlapping pairs? No, all

---------------

 points must be distinct.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of taking the first 9 pairs as 1-9 and their counterparts, maybe

---------------

 we can shift some pairs to include 0 and 20 in the 40 contribution? Wait, but 0 and

---------------

20 can't be part of a pair that contributes 40 because they are outside the 1-19 range.

Wait,

---------------

 but let me think differently. Suppose we don't take all the pairs from 1-19 first, but instead,

---------------

 leave some of them to pair with others to get lower total?

Wait, for example, if we can have a pair that

---------------

 includes 0 and 20, which gives 42, but maybe another pair that can also give 42.

---------------

 Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps some of the pairs in the 1-19 range can be "sacrificed" to allow more

---------------

 low-contribution pairs? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal total is indeed 486, but let's check

---------------

.

Wait, let me recast the problem:

We need 12 pairs (each pair (a,20 -a)), all

---------------

 24 numbers distinct integers. The total sum is sum over all pairs of (Term1 + Term2) for each pair.

---------------

 Each pair's contribution is either:

- 40 if a is between 1 and19 (excluding 10,

---------------

 but pairs are already accounted for as long as distinct),

- 42 if a is 0 or20,

- 44 if a is -1 or21,

- 

---------------

48 if a is -2 or22,

and so on.

So, to minimize the total sum, we need

---------------

 as many pairs as possible with contribution 40, then as many as possible with 42, etc.

The maximum number of pairs contributing

---------------

 40 is 9 (since numbers 1-19 excluding10 gives 18 numbers, which is

---------------

 9 pairs). The remaining 3 pairs must be outside. The minimal contribution for those 3 pairs is to take the next smallest

---------------

 contributions, which are 42 each. However, can we actually get three pairs each contributing 42?

The pairs that contribute 42 are (

---------------

0,20) and (20,0) but that's the same pair, so only one pair can be (0,20). Then

---------------

 the next would be (a=20, but already used. Then next is a=-1 and21, which

---------------

 is 44, and a=21 and -1, same pair. Then next is a= -2 and22 (

---------------

48). Hmm, so actually, the next available pairs after the 9 pairs are (0,20) [

---------------

42], (-1,21)[44], (-2,22)[48], (1,19)

---------------

 already used, etc. So we can only get one pair at 42, then the next two pairs have to be 

---------------

44 and48. That would give total contributions for the remaining three pairs as 42+44+48=134, leading

---------------

 to total sum 9*40 +134= 360+134=494.

Wait

---------------

, but maybe there are other pairs with lower contributions? Let me see:

Wait, if I take a=10 is

---------------

 invalid. What about a=20, which gives (20,0), which is the same as (0,20). So only one pair with

---------------

 contribution 42. Then, perhaps another pair using a= something else?

Wait, maybe instead of taking the first 9 pairs as

---------------

 1-9 and 19-11, perhaps we can exclude some pairs in the middle to include 0 and20?



---------------

For example, if we take the pair (0,20) instead of one of the pairs in the 1-19 range, then

---------------

 we can have an extra pair contributing 42 instead of 40, but that would actually increase the total. So

---------------

 that's worse.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to have more pairs contributing 42?

Wait, the only way

---------------

 to get a contribution of 42 is pairs (0,20) or (20,0) which is same

---------------

, so only one such pair. Similarly, (a=20) and (a=0) are same pair. So

---------------

 only one pair can have 42. Similarly, if you take a= -0, but that's same as 0. So no

---------------

.

Alternatively, maybe there is another a where the contribution is 42? Let me see:

Looking back at the cases

---------------

:

In case2, when a=0, gives 42. In case5, when a=20,

---------------

 but a=20 is in case5, which gives 4a-40, so when a=20, 

---------------

4*20-40=40? Wait wait, hold on, in case5, a >=21,

---------------

 so a=20 is actually in case4.

Wait, let me recheck the case breakdown:

Case4 was 19 ≤a <21.

---------------

 So a=19 and20. So a=20 is in case4. Then in case4, when

---------------

 a=20, the total contribution is 2a +2. So 2*20 +2=42. So that

---------------

's correct. So (a=20, pair is (20,0)), so that is in case4,

---------------

 which allows a=20. So that is indeed a contribution of 42. So the pair (20,0) is in

---------------

 case4.

Similarly, the pair (-1,21): a=-1 is in case2, so contribution was 44.

---------------

 Wait, but a=-1 in case2 gives Term1 + Term2=44, yes. So (a=-1,

---------------

21) gives 44.

So, the pairs contributing 42 are only (0,20). Then

---------------

, the next possible is (21, -1) at 44, then (22,-2) at48, etc.

Therefore

---------------

, for the remaining three pairs beyond the 9 pairs in 1-19, we can only get one pair at42, one

---------------

 at44, and one at48, totaling 134, leading to 494.

Wait, but maybe

---------------

 there are other pairs with a in other regions that can give lower?

Wait, let me see: if I take a=1

---------------

0, but that's invalid. What about a=19.5? Not integer.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of taking

---------------

 the 9 pairs from 1-9 and 11-19, maybe take some pairs that include 0 and20 but

---------------

 still stay within 1-19? No, 0 and20 are outside that range.

Alternatively, is there a way

---------------

 to have more than one pair with contribution 42? Let me see. Suppose we don't use 0 and20 in the

---------------

 first 9 pairs? Wait, they are not in 1-19, so they are not part of the first 9 pairs. So

---------------

 the only way to get 42 is to have the pair (0,20). So only one such pair.



---------------

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe there is a different way to arrange the pairs so that more pairs can be in the 40 contribution?



---------------

Wait, suppose instead of taking all the pairs from 1-9 and 11-19, which are 9 pairs, maybe

---------------

 we can take some pairs that include numbers beyond 19 but still have their counterparts within the range so that they can contribute

---------------

 40?

Wait, for example, if we take a=19, which is allowed, and pairs with 1. That

---------------

's already counted in the first 9. Alternatively, a=20 pairs with0, which is outside. So no

---------------

. So actually, all pairs with a from1 to19 (excluding10) must pair with their counterparts within 

---------------

1 to19. So the first 9 pairs are indeed the maximum number of pairs that can contribute 40.

Thus

---------------

, the minimal total would be 9*40 +1*42 +1*44 +1*48= 360 +42+44+48= 360+134=494.

But wait

---------------

, is there a way to have two pairs contributing 42?

Wait, perhaps if I take the pair (0,20) and

---------------

 (20,0) but that is the same pair. So only one pair can be (0,20). So

---------------

 no.

Alternatively, perhaps another pair with a different a that also gives 42? Let me see:

Wait, let

---------------

 me re-examine the case for a=20. If a=20, then the pair is (20,0). The

---------------

 contribution is 42. Similarly, if a=0, the pair is (0,20), same as before. So only

---------------

 one pair here.

Alternatively, is there another a where the contribution is 42?

Looking at the case for a=19,

---------------

 which is in case4:

At a=19, contribution is 40. So that's already part of the 9 pairs.



---------------

Wait, a=10 is invalid. Hmm.

Alternatively, let me check if there is a miscalculation in

---------------

 my earlier analysis.

Wait, in case4, when a is between19 and21, for a=19,

---------------

 contribution is 40. For a=20, it's 42, and a=21 would be in

---------------

 case5, giving 44? Wait, a=21 is in case5 (a≥21), so contribution

---------------

 is 4a-40. So 4*21-40=84-40=44. So yes

---------------

, that's correct.

Therefore, the only pairs that can contribute less than 44 are:

- The 9 pairs in

---------------

 1-19 (excluding 10) contributing 40 each,

- The pair (0,20) contributing42,

-

---------------

 The next is ( -1,21) contributing44,

- Then ( -2,22) contributing48,

But

---------------

 we need three more pairs beyond the 9. So first is (0,20)=42, second (-1,21)=44, third (-2,22)=48. Total

---------------

 extra 134, so total sum 494.

Alternatively, can we choose different pairs to get lower total

---------------

?

Suppose instead of taking (-2,22)=48, we take (2,18) but that's already used

---------------

 in the first 9 pairs. So no.

Alternatively, is there another pair that can contribute 44?

Yes, for

---------------

 example, the pair (a=21, -1) is one pair contributing44. Similarly, (a= -1,21).

---------------

 So that's one pair. Then, is there another pair that can contribute44? Let's see:

If a=21,

---------------

 which pairs with -1, giving44. If a= -2, pairs with22, which is48. a

---------------

=2, already used. a=22 would pair with-2, which is48. a= -3 pairs

---------------

 with23 (52), etc. So the next after44 is48. So no, there's only one pair at

---------------

44, then the next is48.

Alternatively, maybe using a=1 and19? But those are already in

---------------

 the first set.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of taking the pair (0,20), we can take another pair which allows

---------------

 another pair with lower contribution? Not sure.

Alternatively, is there a different arrangement where some pairs are arranged to have lower total

---------------

?

Suppose instead of taking the first 9 pairs as (1,19) up to (9,11), maybe

---------------

 we can exclude one of those pairs to include two pairs with lower total?

Wait, for example, if we exclude the pair (1,19) which contributes40, then we can have

---------------

 two other pairs: (0,20) and (-1,21). Then their total would be42+44=86,

---------------

 compared to the original40. So that would actually be worse (86 vs40). So that's not helpful

---------------

.

Alternatively, maybe exclude two pairs contributing40 to get three pairs contributing lower? Wait, but the other pairs outside contribute

---------------

 more than40, so that would be worse.

Hmm, so it seems unavoidable that the minimal total is 494.

---------------

 But let me check another approach.

Alternatively, what if we arrange the pairs so that some of the pairs are symmetric around 10 but include

---------------

 numbers closer to -1,0,1, where the expression |y -1| + |y +1| is minimized

---------------

 (i.e., equals2). However, since each pair must sum to20, if one element is near -1, the other is

---------------

 near21, which is far from the interval [-1,1], so the total contribution might not be better.

For

---------------

 example, let's take the pair (-1,21). Their contributions would be:

For -1: | -1 -1| + | -1 +1| =2 +0=2,

For21: |21 -1| + |21 +1|=20+22=42,

Total for

---------------

 pair:2+42=44.

Alternatively, if we take the pair (0,20):

0 contributes

---------------

2, 20 contributes |20-1| + |20+1|=19+21=40,



---------------

Total:2+40=42.

Similarly, pair (1,19):

1: |1-1| + |1+1|=0 +2=2,

19: |19-1| + |19+1|=18+20=38,

Total:2+38=40.

Ah! Wait a second,

---------------

 I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate the contribution for each pair.

Wait, earlier I considered for a pair (a, 20 -a), the total is

---------------

 Term1(a) + Term2(a). But actually, the total contribution for the pair is (Term1(a) + Term1(20 -a)). Wait

---------------

, no, actually, each pair has two elements: a and 20 -a. So for each pair, the

---------------

 total contribution is [ |a -1| + |a +1| ] + [ |(20 -a) -1| + |(20 -a) +1| ]

---------------

.

Which is exactly what I computed before as Term1(a) + Term2(a). So the previous analysis holds. But

---------------

 when I broke it down for specific examples like (1,19):

The total contribution was 2 +38=40, which matches the

---------------

 previous calculation (for a=1, which is in case3, giving total40). Similarly, (0,20) gives 

---------------

2 +40=42, which is correct. So the previous analysis is correct.

However, here's an idea

---------------

: If I can have as many points as possible in the interval [-1,1], since their contribution is 2 each

---------------

. Each such point can be paired with another point (20 - y), but if y is in [-1,1], then 20 - y is between

---------------

19 and21. So for each y in [-1,1], the other point is in [19,21],

---------------

 contributing a higher amount.

So to have a point y in [-1,1], you have to pair it with 20 - y in

---------------

 [19,21]. So for each such y, the pair contributes 2 + (contribution of 20 - y). For

---------------

 example, if y=0, the pair contributes 2 +40=42 (as before). If y=1, the

---------------

 pair contributes2 +38=40. If y=-1, the pair contributes2 + (contribution of21)=

---------------

2 + (|21-1|+|21+1|)=2 +42=44. Wait

---------------

, but 21's contribution is |21 -1| + |21+1|=20+22=42, so total

---------------

 pair is 2 +42=44, yes.

Therefore, to have a point in [-1,1], you

---------------

 have to take the hit of their partner's contribution. The minimal contribution for such a pair is when y=1, giving

---------------

 total40. Because y=1 pairs with19, which contributes38, so total40. Similarly, y=0 pairs

---------------

 with20, contributing40, total42. y=-1 pairs with21, contributing42, total44.

Therefore, the

---------------

 best among these is to have y=1 paired with19 (total40). So that's already accounted for in our initial

---------------

 9 pairs (since (1,19) is part of the first 9 pairs contributing40). So that

---------------

 pair is already in the optimal set.

Therefore, the points y=1 and19 are already included in the first9

---------------

 pairs. Similarly, y=0 would require pairing with20, which adds42. So to minimize the total, it

---------------

's better to include as many pairs from the first9 as possible (since they give40 each), and only use the pairs

---------------

 involving [-1,0,1] when necessary.

Since we have to have 24 distinct points, and the first9 pairs use

---------------

 up numbers1-9 and11-19 (18 numbers), we need 6 more numbers, which must

---------------

 be 0, -1, -2,... and20,21, etc. To minimize the total, we need

---------------

 to choose the minimal contributions for those 6 numbers.

The minimal contributions for the remaining numbers would be:

The next closest pairs

---------------

 are (0,20) contributing42,

(-1,21) contributing44,

and then (-2,22) contributing48,

but

---------------

 since we need three more pairs (6 numbers), those three pairs are necessary.

Thus, the total would indeed be 9*40 + 

---------------

42 +44 +48 = 494.

Wait, but let me confirm with an explicit example.



---------------

Suppose we have the first 9 pairs as:

(1,19), (2,18), (3,17), (4,16), (5,15), (6,14), (7,13), (8,12), (9,11).

---------------

 These contribute 9*40=360.

Then the remaining three pairs:

(0,20): contributes

---------------

42,

(-1,21): contributes44,

(-2,22): contributes48.

Total extra

---------------

:42+44+48=134,

Total sum: 360+134=494.

Alternatively, could

---------------

 we choose different pairs for the last three to get a lower total?

Suppose instead of taking (-2,22),

---------------

 which is48, we take another pair like (23,-3), which would contribute even more (52). So that's worse.

Alternatively, is

---------------

 there a pair that uses a number between1-19 not already used? All numbers from1-19 except10 are already used. So no

---------------

.

Alternatively, can we use a=10? No, since it pairs with itself.

Alternatively, use a=2

---------------

0 with0, which we did.

Alternatively, is there a way to have two pairs with contribution42? Like (

---------------

0,20) and (20,0) but that's the same pair.

Alternatively, can we have another

---------------

 a where the contribution is42? For example, a=20 gives42, but that's the same pair.

Alternatively

---------------

, a= -0? No, same as0.

Hmm, so I don't think so. Therefore, 494 might

---------------

 be the minimal.

Wait, but let's think again. The problem states that the 24 points must be distinct integers. So

---------------

 when I have the pair (0,20), those numbers are new. Similarly, (-1,21), (-

---------------

2,22) are new. So all 24 points are distinct.

Alternatively, maybe there's another set of pairs that can

---------------

 be arranged to have lower total.

Suppose instead of taking ( -2,22), can we take a pair like

---------------

 (10,10)? No, since they must be distinct.

Alternatively, what if we rearrange some of the first pairs to free

---------------

 up numbers?

Suppose we remove one pair from the first9 pairs, say (9,11), and instead use

---------------

 those numbers in another pair to get a better total. Let's see:

If we remove (9,11), which

---------------

 contributes40, and instead use 9 and11 in other pairs. For example, pair9 with something else,

---------------

 but they have to be reflections. So 9 must pair with20 -9=11, which is the original pair. So can

---------------

't change that.

Alternatively, perhaps not take (1,19) but instead use1 in another pair? But1

---------------

 has to pair with19. So no.

Alternatively, is there a different pairing strategy?

Wait, what if we don

---------------

't take the first9 pairs but instead take some other pairs that might allow us to have more low contributions?

Suppose instead of taking

---------------

 pairs from1-9 and11-19, we take some pairs that include0 and20 but still get

---------------

 most pairs at40.

Wait, let's see: suppose we take the pair (0,20) contributing42.

---------------

 Then we can still take pairs from1-19 excluding0 and20. Wait, but0 and20 are outside that

---------------

 range.

Wait, the numbers from1-19 excluding10 give18 numbers, which is9 pairs. If we use

---------------

 one of those numbers in another pair with0 or20, we lose a pair that would have contributed40 and instead

---------------

 get a pair contributing42 but also have to deal with another pair.

For example, suppose we take the pair (0,20)

---------------

 instead of the pair (1,19). Then we lose the40 contribution and gain42, so net loss

---------------

 of2. But then we still need to use1 and19 in another pair? But they have to be paired with their reflections.

---------------

1 must pair with19, so they have to be together. So you can't separate them. So if you don

---------------

't pair them, you can't use either of them in another pair without breaking the reflection rule.

Therefore, it's impossible

---------------

 to "free up" numbers from the first9 pairs without losing their contribution.

Hence, the minimal total is indeed 494.

Wait, but let

---------------

 me check one more thing. The problem says "24 distinct integer points y_1,…,y_{24}". So

---------------

 all the numbers must be distinct integers. In the arrangement I suggested, all numbers from1-19 (except10),0

---------------

,-1,-2,20,21,22 are used. That's 18 +4 +4

---------------

=26? Wait no, let's count:

First9 pairs use numbers1-9 and11-19: that's9

---------------

+9=18 numbers.

Then three more pairs: (0,20), (-1,21), (-2,22).

---------------

 These add0,20,-1,21,-2,22: 6 new numbers. Total numbers:18+6=24. Correct

---------------

.

All distinct. So that's valid.

Is there a different set of three pairs beyond the first9 that can give a lower total?

Suppose instead of taking

---------------

 (-2,22)=48, can we take (a=2,18) but they are already used

---------------

. No.

Alternatively, pair (-3,23) contributing | -3 -1| + |-3 +1| + |23 -1| + |23 +1|

---------------

 = (4 + 2) + (22 +24)=6+46=52. Worse.

Alternatively, (

---------------

 -1,21)=44, (0,20)=42, and ( maybe (3,17)

---------------

 but that's already used. No.

Alternatively, perhaps a different combination: (0,20)=42, (1

---------------

,19)=40, but (1,19) is already in the first9 pairs. So can't reuse

---------------

.

Alternatively, perhaps taking one of the pairs from the first9 and combining it with others? Doesn't seem possible.

Therefore

---------------

, I think the minimal total is 494.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me recalculate the total

---------------

 for the three additional pairs:

(0,20): contribution is |0-1|+|0+1| + |20-1|+|20+1| = (1+1)+(19+21)=2+40=42.



---------------

(-1,21): | -1-1| + | -1+1| + |21-1| + |21+1| = (2+0)+(20+22)=2+42=44.

(-2,22): | -2-1| + |-2+1| + |22-1| + |22+1| = (3 +1)+(21+23)=4+44=48.

Yes

---------------

, so those are correct. So 42+44+48=134. 9*40=360. 360+134=494.

But

---------------

 hold on, the problem says "24 distinct integer points". The points include all the numbers from the pairs. Let me verify

---------------

 that all numbers are distinct.

First9 pairs: 1-9 and11-19 (excluding10). So numbers:

---------------

1,2,...,9,11,12,...,19. That's 18 numbers.

Then

---------------

 the three additional pairs:

0,20; -1,21; -2,22.

These are 

---------------

0,20,-1,21,-2,22. None of these are in the first set except maybe 20 and

---------------

21,22 which are outside 1-19 except20 is outside. So yes, all distinct. 

---------------

18+6=24. Perfect.

Therefore, the minimal total is 494. But wait, let

---------------

 me check once more if there's a smarter combination.

Suppose instead of taking the pair (-2,22), can

---------------

 I take another pair that uses a number already in the first set but that's not possible because all first set numbers are already paired.

Alternatively, is

---------------

 there a different way to choose the first9 pairs to allow a better combination?

Wait, the first9 pairs are forced to be the

---------------

 9 pairs from1-9 and11-19. There's no other way to choose 9 pairs within1-19 without

---------------

 overlapping. So that's optimal.

Alternatively, perhaps using a different reflection point? Wait, no, the reflection is fixed around

---------------

x=10.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the contribution for a pair like (a=1

---------------

,19). Let me recalculate that:

For a=1:

Term1 = |1 -1| + |1 +1| =0 +2=2,

Term2 (

---------------

for20 -1=19):

|19-1| + |19+1| =18+20=38,

Total contribution

---------------

:2+38=40. Correct.

Similarly, for a=9:

|9-1| + |9+1|=8+10=18,

Term

---------------

2 for20-9=11:

|11-1| + |11+1|=10+12=22,

Total:

---------------

18+22=40. Correct.

So all those pairs contribute40. So that's solid.

Hmm

---------------

. So I think 494 is correct, but the problem says "the minimum possible value". Wait, but maybe

---------------

 there's a different configuration where some pairs can have lower contributions?

Wait, another idea: What if some pairs are arranged such that both elements are in [-1,1]

---------------

?

But for two numbers to be reflections across10 and both be in [-1,1], their midpoint must be10. So

---------------

 (y1 + y2)/2=10, so y1 + y2=20. But if both y1 and y2 are between-1 and1, their sum can

---------------

 be at most1+1=2, which is way less than20. So impossible. So no such pairs can

---------------

 exist. Thus, any pair must have one element significantly larger than10 and the other smaller, but not both in the low

---------------

 interval.

Therefore, the minimal total is indeed 494. But wait, let me check the problem statement again:



---------------

"24 distinct integer points y_1, y_2, …, y_{24} on the number line such that for all k where 1 ≤k ≤12, we have y_{2k-1} is the reflection of y_{2k} across x."

So

---------------

 each pair (y_{2k-1}, y_{2k}) must be reflections. So each pair must sum to20. So

---------------

 yes, our approach is correct.

Wait, but maybe there is a different pairing where some pairs have a contribution less than40?

Wait

---------------

, in case3, when a is between1 and19, the contribution is40. So no pair can have less

---------------

 than40 unless a is in other regions where the total is less than40. Looking back:

In case2 (a

---------------

 between-1 and1), the total is42 -2a. The minimal in that interval is40 when a approaches1 from

---------------

 below (a=1 gives40? Wait a=1 is in case3. Wait when a=1, it

---------------

's in case3 (1≤a<19), so contribution is40. So actually, at a=1, it

---------------

's in case3. So the minimal contribution per pair is indeed40, and you can't get lower than that.

---------------

 So 40 is the minimal per pair possible.

Therefore, with 12 pairs, the theoretical minimum would be12×40=480, but since

---------------

 we can only have9 pairs at40, the rest have to be higher, so 494 is the minimal

---------------

.

Wait, but hold on, the problem says "24 distinct integer points". So perhaps there's a way to have more than9 pairs in

---------------

 the 40 contribution?

Wait, how many pairs can we have with a between1 and19 (excluding10)?



---------------

Numbers from1 to19 excluding10: that's18 numbers, which make9 pairs. So that's the

---------------

 maximum. So no, can't have more.

Therefore, I think the minimal total is494. But I have

---------------

 a doubt because maybe I missed a configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps using a=10 in some way, but since it can

---------------

't pair with itself, no.

Alternatively, using non-integer points? No, the points must be integers.

Hmm.



---------------

Wait, let me try to compute for another configuration where instead of going to -2,22, maybe take another pair that

---------------

 gives a lower contribution?

Suppose instead of taking (-2,22), take (23,-3). But that would

---------------

 give even higher contribution.

Alternatively, perhaps (a= -3,23), contribution would be:

For a=-3,



---------------

Term1= |-3-1| + |-3+1| =4 +2=6,

Term2 for23:

|23-1| + |23+1|=22+24=46,

Total:

---------------

6+46=52. Worse.

Alternatively, (a= -4,24), contribution60?

---------------

 Even worse.

Hmm. So no improvement there.

Alternatively, what about a=10.5? Not integer.

Alternatively

---------------

, maybe using a=19.5? No.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal is actually 480 +

---------------

 14=494? Wait, but why 14? No, it's 9×40 +

---------------

 three pairs:42+44+48=134. 9×40=360,

---------------

 360+134=494.

Alternatively, let me think differently.

The total sum over all pairs

---------------

 is sum_{n=1}^{24} (|y_n -1| + |y_n +1|).

---------------

 Since each pair (a,20 -a) contributes (|a-1| + |a+1|) + (|19 -a| + |21 -a|).



---------------

So maybe there's a way to write the total sum as a function over all a_i where the pairs are (a_i,20 -a_i),

---------------

 and then find the minimal sum over all possible such pairings.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for each pair (a,20 -a), the total contribution is f

---------------

(a) where f(a) is:

As before:

If a is between1 and19 (excluding10), f(a)=40,

If

---------------

 a=0 or20, f(a)=42,

a=-1 or21: f(a)=44,

a=-2 or22: f(a)=48,

and

---------------

 so on.

Therefore, to minimize the total sum, we need as many as possible of the f(a_i)=40, then 

---------------

42, etc.

Thus, with 12 pairs, the minimal is 9×40 +3×42= 360+126=486?

---------------

 Wait, but how?

Wait, if I can have three pairs at42 instead of one at42, one at44, one at48.



---------------

Wait, but how? The only way to get42 is with a=0 or20. So only one pair can be

---------------

42. The next is44 with a=-1 or21. So two pairs can give42 and44?



---------------

Wait no, only one pair can be (0,20). The next is (-1,21)=44. The

---------------

 third is (-2,22)=48. So three pairs give 42+44+48=134.



---------------

Alternatively, can I have another pair that gives42? For instance, using a different a?

Wait, a=20 gives

---------------

42, but that's the same pair. So no.

Alternatively, a= something else?

Wait, if a= 

---------------

10, but that's invalid.

Hmm.

Wait a different approach: Let me compute the total sum for the configuration I considered

---------------

:

First9 pairs (1-9 and11-19):

Each contributes40, so 9×40=360.

The

---------------

 three additional pairs:

(0,20):42,

(-1,21):44,

(-2,22):48,

Total extra

---------------

:134,

Total:360+134=494.

Alternatively, suppose I take three

---------------

 pairs as (0,20), ( -1,21), and (1,19). But (1,19) is already in the first set. Can't reuse

---------------

.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different way to arrange the first pairs to free up a number?

Wait, suppose I don

---------------

't take the pair (9,11), but instead take (9, something else). But9 must pair with11.

---------------

 So no.

Alternatively, is there a pair that can be formed outside the 1-19 range but still gives a

---------------

 lower total than48?

Wait, for example, take a= -3 and23: total52, which is worse.

Alternatively

---------------

, a= -4 and24: 56.

No.

Alternatively, maybe instead of taking three pairs beyond the

---------------

 first9, maybe there is a smarter way.

Wait, if I take the first10 pairs as follows:

Take pairs

---------------

 (0,20), (1,19), (2,18), ..., (9,11). That

---------------

's10 pairs:

(0,20) contributes42,

Then (1,19) to(9,11) are

---------------

9 pairs contributing40 each.

Total for10 pairs:42 +9×40= 42+360=402.

Then remaining

---------------

 two pairs need to be formed from remaining numbers.

The used numbers so far are0,20, and1-9,11-19. So

---------------

 total used numbers:2+18=20. Remaining numbers: -1,-2,... and21,22,...



---------------

Need four more numbers, forming two pairs.

To minimize, take the next best pairs:

Pair (-1,21):

---------------

44,

Pair (-2,22):48.

Total for these two pairs:44+48=92.

Total overall:402+92=494. Same result.

Alternatively, if

---------------

 I take the first11 pairs as:

(0,20)=42,

(1,19)=40,

(

---------------

2,18)=40,

...

(10th pair: (10,10) invalid),

Wait no

---------------

, can't do that. So up to (10 pairs: (0,20) plus nine pairs from1-9 and11-19 (

---------------

excluding10). So same as before.

Alternatively, take first pair as (0,20), then pairs (1,19) to (10,10)

---------------

 but the last is invalid.

No, so no improvement.

Alternatively, another configuration where two of the additional pairs are ( -

---------------

1,21) and ( -0,20), but -0 is0, so that's same as before.

Alternatively

---------------

, maybe take pairs like ( -1,21), ( -2,22), and ( -3,23),

---------------

 totaling three pairs with contributions44,48,52. That would be worse.

Alternatively, perhaps using a=

---------------

 20 and0, then a= 21 and-1, and a=19 and1 (already counted

---------------

). No, can't.

Hmm. It seems no matter how I arrange it, the minimal total I can get is494. Therefore

---------------

, I think that must be the answer.

But wait, wait a second. Let me think differently. The expression |y -1| + |y +1| can

---------------

 be written as 2*max(|y|,1). Wait let me see:

Wait, for y >=1, it's2y.

---------------

 Since y>=1, max(|y|,1)=y, so2y.

For y between-1 and1, it's2, which is2*max(1, since

---------------

 |y| <=1).

For y <=-1, it's-2y. Since y is negative, -2y=

---------------

2|y|. And since |y| >=1, so that's 2*|y|.

Therefore, the expression simplifies to 2*max(|y|,1).

Therefore

---------------

, the total sum is 2*sum_{n=1}^{24} max(|y_n|,1).

Therefore

---------------

, to minimize the total sum, we need to minimize the sum of max(|y_n|,1) over all2

---------------

4 points.

Ah, this is a key insight! Maybe this reformulation can help.

Since max(|y|,1) is equal to |y| if |y| >=

---------------

1, else1.

Therefore, the total sum is twice the sum over all y_n of max(|y_n|,1).

Therefore

---------------

, to minimize this, we need as many y_n as possible with |y_n| <1, i.e., y_n in

---------------

 {-0,0}, but since they have to be integers, only y=0 is in that range where max(|y|,1)=1. The

---------------

 points y=-1 and1 have max(|y|,1)=1 as well? Wait no:

Wait for y=1

---------------

: |1|=1, so max(|1|,1)=1, so contribution1.

Similarly y=-1: max

---------------

(1,1)=1.

y=0: max(0,1)=1.

Therefore, for y in {-1,0,1}, the max is1. For other

---------------

 integers, it's |y|.

Therefore, the total sum is 2*(number_of_points_in_{-1,0,1} *1 + sum_{other points

---------------

} |y| )

Therefore, to minimize this, we want as many points as possible in {-1,0,1}, and for the remaining points, have

---------------

 their absolute values as small as possible.

However, due to the reflection condition, each pair (y,20 -y) must be

---------------

 such that they are reflections across10. So for each such pair, if one is in {-1,0,1}, the other will

---------------

 be20 - y, which will be in {19,20,21}. So for each point in {-1,0,1}, its

---------------

 pair is in {19,20,21}. Thus, the pairs involving {-1,0,1} will have one

---------------

 point contributing1 and the other contributing max(|20 - y|,1). For y in {-1,0,1}, 20 - y is in

---------------

 {21,20,19}, so their contributions are max(21,1)=21, max(20,1)=20, max(19,1)=19. Therefore

---------------

, those pairs would contribute1 +21,1+20,1+19 respectively.

Thus, if we have

---------------

 a pair (y,20-y) where y is in {-1,0,1}, their total contribution to the sum is

---------------

 (1 + max(|20 - y|,1)). For y=-1:1+21=22,

---------------

 y=0:1+20=21, y=1:1+19=20.

Therefore

---------------

, to minimize the total, if we have to include such pairs, it's better to have y=1 paired with19 (total

---------------

20), then y=0 paired with20 (21), then y=-1 paired with21 (22). So

---------------

 the minimal contribution for each such pair is20,21,22.

However, if we don't use these

---------------

 points in {-1,0,1}, then their pairs are in {19,20,21}, which

---------------

 would contribute max(|19|,1)=19, max(20,1)=20, max(21,1)=21.



---------------

Wait, let's clarify:

If we don't use y=1, then the pair (1,19) would

---------------

 be part of the main pairs contributing40, which corresponds to their contributions:

For y=1: contribution is1 (since |

---------------

1| >=1, max(|1|,1)=1? Wait no, max(|1|,1) is1, but

---------------

 the expression is 2*max(|y|,1). Wait, no:

Wait, the total contribution for the pair (1,19) is:



---------------

For y=1: max(|1|,1)=1,

For y=19:max(|19|,1)=19,

Total

---------------

 for the pair: (1 +19)*2=40, which matches previous calculation.

Similarly, if we instead

---------------

 have the pair (0,20):

For y=0: max(0,1)=1,

For y=20:max(20,1)=20,

Total contribution

---------------

: (1+20)*2=42, which also matches.

Therefore, the earlier analysis holds.

Therefore, to

---------------

 minimize the total sum, we want as many pairs as possible to be from the 1-19 range (excluding10), giving

---------------

 contributions of40 each, and the remaining pairs must be formed with points outside, adding the minimal possible.

Therefore, the

---------------

 minimal total is indeed494. Hence, the answer is 494.

Wait, but according to the problem

---------------

 statement, the answer should be in a box as Answer: \boxed{494}

But let me cross-verify once

---------------

 more:

Total for first9 pairs:9×40=360.

Additional three pairs:

(0,20):42,

(-1,21):44,

(-2,22):48,

Total:

---------------

42+44+48=134,

360+134=494.

Yes,

---------------

 that seems correct.

However, let me see an alternative configuration where the three extra pairs are (0,20), ( -

---------------

1,21), and ( 10,10). But the last is invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach

---------------

 where instead of taking -2,22, take another pair with a higher number but lower contribution? Not possible.

Alternatively

---------------

, maybe using a different set of three pairs beyond the first9 that somehow overlap?

No, all must be distinct.

Hmm

---------------

. I think I've exhausted all possibilities, so I'll go with494.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{494}


To solve the problem, we need to find the minimum possible value of the sum \(\sum_{n=1}^{24} (|y_n - 1| + |y_n + 1|)\) for 24 distinct integer points \(y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_{24}\) such that each pair \(y_{2k-1}\) and \(y_{2k}\) are reflections across \(x = 10\). 

### Key Steps:

1. **Reflections

---------------

 and Pair Sum**:
   - Each pair \((y_{2k-1}, y_{2k})\) must satisfy \(y_{2k-1} + y_{2k} = 20\).

2. **Expression Simplification**:
   - The expression \(|y - 1| + |y + 1|\) simplifies to:
     - \(2y\) if \(y \geq 1\),
     - \(2\) if \(-1 \leq y \leq 1\),
     - \(-2y\) if \(y \leq -1\).

3. **Opt

---------------

imal Pair Contribution**:
   - For pairs \((a, 20 - a)\), the total contribution is minimized

---------------

 when \(a\) is in the range \([1, 19]\), excluding 10, resulting in a contribution of 40 per pair.
   - P

---------------

airs involving values outside this range (e.g., 0, 20, -1, 21, etc.) have higher contributions.

4. **Maximizing Opt

---------------

imal Pairs**:
   - The maximum number of pairs with contribution 40 is 9, using numbers from 1 to 19 (excluding 10), which

---------------

 gives 18 distinct integers.
   - The remaining 6 numbers must form 3 pairs, which must be outside the 1-19 range.

5. **Remaining

---------------

 Pairs**:
   - The next optimal pairs are:
     - \((0, 20)\) contributing 42,
     - \((-1, 21)\) contributing 44,
     - \((-2, 22)\) contributing 48.

### Calculations:
- Contribution from 9 optimal pairs: \(9 \times 40 = 360\)
- Contribution from remaining 3 pairs: \(42 + 44 + 48 = 134\)
- Total minimum value: \(360 + 134 = 494\)

### Final Answer:
\boxed{494}<|im_end|>
