Okay, so Maisy is starting at the origin (0,0) and she moves in a pattern. Let me see if I can figure out her path step by step. The problem says:

On her first step, she moves 1 unit up. Then second step, 1 unit right. Third step, 2 units up. Fourth step, 2 units right. Then she repeats this pattern with each odd-numbered step being 1 unit more than the previous step. We need to find where she is after 21 steps and then compute x + y.

Hmm, let me parse that again. The key points are the steps alternate between vertical (up) and horizontal (right) movements. The odd-numbered steps (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.) are vertical, and the even-numbered ones (2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.) are horizontal. Also, each odd step is 1 unit more than the previous odd step. Wait, actually, the problem says "each odd-numbered step being 1 unit more than the previous step." Wait, maybe I need to check that again.

Wait the problem states: "she moves 1 unit up. On her second step, she moves 1 unit to the right. On her third step, she moves 2 units up. On her fourth step, she moves 2 units to the right. She repeats this pattern with each odd-numbered step being 1 unit more than the previous step."

Wait, so the odd-numbered steps (steps 1, 3, 5,...) are the vertical movements, and each of these is increasing by 1 each time. So step 1: 1 unit up. Step 3: 2 units up. Step 5: 3 units up, etc. Similarly, the even-numbered steps (steps 2,4,6,...) are horizontal movements, and each of these is also increasing by 1 each time? Because step 2 is 1 right, step 4 is 2 right, step 6 would be 3 right? Wait, let me confirm.

Looking at the problem statement again: "the pattern" after the first four steps. The first four steps are 1 up, 1 right, 2 up, 2 right. So the pattern is that each pair of steps (odd then even) increases by 1 unit each. So step 1 (odd): 1 up, step 2 (even):1 right; step3 (odd):2 up, step4 (even):2 right; step5 (odd):3 up, step6 (even):3 right; and so on. So yes, each odd-numbered step's magnitude is 1 more than the previous odd step, and similarly for even steps. So the horizontal steps (even) also increase by 1 every two steps. So step 2 is 1, step4 is 2, step6 is 3, etc. So both

---------------

 the vertical and horizontal steps increase by 1 every two steps.

Therefore, after n steps, we need to figure out how many vertical and horizontal steps she has taken, and their magnitudes.

Since we need the 21st step, let's note that steps come in pairs: each pair consists of an odd step (vertical) followed by an even step (horizontal). Each pair corresponds to a "cycle" where the vertical and horizontal steps increase by 1 each cycle. Wait, actually, each pair is one

---------------

 step up and one step right, with their magnitudes increasing each time. Let me think in terms of cycles.

Each "cycle" is two steps: an odd step (vertical) and the next even step (horizontal). The first cycle (steps 1 and 2): 1 up, 1 right. The second cycle (steps 3 and 4): 2 up, 2 right. The third cycle (steps 5 and 6):3 up, 3 right. So each cycle k (starting at 1) consists of (2k-1)th and 2kth steps, moving k units up and then k units right. So the nth cycle has step 2n-1 and 2n, moving n units up and n units right.

Therefore, after n cycles (i.e., 2n steps), the total vertical movement is the sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + ... +n, and the same for horizontal. Therefore, after n cycles, x-coordinate is sum_{k=1}^n k, and y-coordinate is also sum_{k=1}^n k. Therefore, each coordinate would be (n(n+1)/2, n(n+1)/2).

However, the problem is asking for 21 steps. Since 21 is an odd number, that means she has completed some number of full cycles (each being 2 steps) plus one additional step. Let's see: 21 divided by 2 is 10.5, so 10 full cycles (20 steps) plus one more step (the 21st step). Since each cycle is two steps, 10 cycles would be 20 steps, so step 21 is the next odd-numbered step (since 21 is odd), which is part of the 11th cycle. The

---------------

 11th cycle's first step (step 21) would be moving vertically (up) with magnitude equal to 11 units, since each cycle k has movement of k units. Wait, hold on: Let me confirm.

Wait in the first cycle (steps 1-2), k=1, so 1 unit up and 1 right.

Second cycle (steps 3-4), k=2, so 2 up and 2 right.

Third cycle (steps 5-6), k=3, so 3 up and 3 right.

So for the nth cycle (steps 2n-1 and 2n), the vertical movement is n units up, and horizontal is n units right.

Therefore, the 11th cycle (steps 21 and 22) would have k=11, so step 21 (2*11 -1 =21) is 11 units up, and step 22 would be 11 units right.

But since we're only going up to step 21, we have 10 full cycles (steps 1-20) plus step 21 (the first part of the 11th cycle).

Therefore, the total vertical movement after 20 steps (10 cycles) is sum_{k=1}^{10} k, which is (10)(11)/2 = 55. Similarly, horizontal movement is also 55. Then, step 21 is the 11 units up, so adding 11 to the y-coordinate. Therefore, total y-coordinate becomes 55 +11 =66, and x-coordinate remains 55. Thus, the point after 21 steps is (55,66), so x + y is 55 +66=121.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me verify step by step to make sure.

Alternatively, let me think

---------------

 again:

Let me tabulate the steps to confirm:

Step 1: 1 up → (0,1)

Step 2: 1 right → (1,1)

Step 3: 2 up → (1,3)

Step 4: 2 right → (3,3)

Step 5: 3 up → (3,6)

Step 6: 3 right → (6,6)

Step 7: 4 up → (6,10)

Step 8:4 right → (10,10)

Step 9:5 up → (10,15)

Step 10:5 right → (15,15)

Step 11:6 up → (15,21)

Step12:6 right → (21,21)

Step13:7 up → (21,28)

Step14:7 right → (28,28)

Step15:8 up → (28,36)

Step16:8 right → (36,36)

Step17:9 up → (36,45)

Step18:9 right → (45,45)

Step19:10 up → (45,55)

Step20:10 right → (55,55)

Step21:11 up → (55, 55+11=66)

Yes, so after step 21, she is at (55,66). Therefore x + y = 55 +66 =121.

Hmm, that seems correct. Let me check another way.

Alternatively, since

---------------

 after every two steps (each cycle), the coordinates increase by (k, k) where k is the cycle number. So after n cycles (2n steps), the coordinates are (sum_{k=1}^n k, sum_{k=1}^n k). Therefore, after 10 cycles (20 steps), it

---------------

's (55,55). Then step 21 is the 11th cycle's first step, adding 11 to y: so (55,66). Thus x+y=121.

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 we can model the coordinates after n steps. Let's see:

For any step number, say step m. Let's see if m is odd or even. Let m = 2k-1 or 2k.

Suppose m is odd: m = 2k-1. Then that's the k-th odd step, so the vertical movement for that step is k units up. Wait, no

---------------

: Let me see.

Wait step 1: k=1, movement 1 up.

Step3 (2*2-1=3): movement 2 up.

Step5 (2*3-1=5):3 up. So yes, for step number 2k-1 (odd steps), the vertical movement is k units. So in general, for the (2k-1)th step, the movement is k units up.

Similarly, even steps: step 2 is 1 right, step4 is 2 right, step6 is 3 right. So step 2k is k units right.

Therefore, for any step number:

If step number is odd: 2k-1, then movement is k units up.

If even: 2k, movement is k units right.

Therefore, after 21 steps, which is an odd step (21=2*11 -1), so the 21st step is the 11th odd step, so it's moving 11 units up. To compute total coordinates:

First, the number of vertical steps: since every odd step is vertical, so up to step 21, there are 11 vertical steps (since 21 is the 11th odd number). The total vertical movement is sum_{k=1}^{11} k. Wait, but hold on. Wait, actually, each vertical step (odd steps) is k units where k is (step number +1)/2. Wait, perhaps better to think:

Each vertical step (step 1,3,...,21) is step number m =2k-1, so k=(m+1)/2. Therefore, the vertical steps are 1,2,3,...,11 units respectively. So total vertical movement is sum_{k=1}^{11}k = (11)(12)/2=66.

The horizontal steps are the even steps up to step 20 (since step21 is odd). The even steps are steps 2,4,...,20. There are 10 even steps here. Each even step m=2k, so k= m/2. The horizontal movement for each even step is k units, so steps 2 (k=1), 4 (k=2), ..., 20 (k=10). So total horizontal movement is sum_{k=1}^{10}k = (10)(11)/2=55.

Therefore, total coordinates after 21 steps: x=55, y=66, so x+y=121.

Yes, that's another way to get the same answer, which confirms it. Therefore, the answer is 121.

**Final Answer**
Answer: 121


Maisy starts at the origin (0,0) and moves according to a specific pattern. Each odd-numbered step is vertical (up) and each even-numbered step is horizontal (right). The magnitude of each vertical step increases by 1 unit every two steps, and similarly for the horizontal steps.

To determine her position after 21 steps, we note the following:
- After 20 steps (10 full cycles), each cycle consisting of two steps (vertical then horizontal), the coordinates are calculated as follows:
  - Vertical movement after 10 cycles: Sum of the first 10 natural numbers: \(\sum_{k=1}^{10} k = \frac{10 \cdot 11}{2} = 55\).
  - Horizontal movement after 10 cycles: Similarly, \(\sum_{k=1}^{10} k = 55\).
  - Thus, after 20 steps, Maisy is at \((55, 55)\).

- The 21st step is the first step of the 11th cycle, which is a vertical movement of 11 units up.
  - Adding this to the previous vertical position: \(55 + 11 = 66\).

Therefore, after 21 steps, Maisy is at the point \((55, 66)\). The sum of the coordinates is \(55 + 66 = 121\).

\boxed{121}
