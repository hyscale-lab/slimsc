Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Angeline has a 6-digit number, and when she moves the last digit to the front, the new number is four times the original number. We need to find the smallest possible original number. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, let me denote the original number as a 6-digit number. Let's call the original number N. Since it's a 6-digit number, the first digit can't be zero. Let's represent N as:

N = 100000a + 10000b + 1000c + 100d + 10e + f

Where a, b, c, d, e are digits from 0 to 9, and a can't be zero. The last digit is f, which we're going to move to the front. So when we move the last digit f to the front, the new number becomes:

New Number = 100000f + 10000a + 1000b + 100c + 10d + e

According to the problem, this new number is equal to 4 times the original number. So:

100000f + 10000a + 1000b + 100c + 10d + e = 4*(100000a + 10000b + 1000c + 100d + 10e + f)

Hmm, okay. Let's write that equation out more clearly. Let me denote N as the original number, so the equation becomes:

New Number = 4*N

But the New Number can also be expressed in terms of N's digits. Let me see if I can find a relationship between N and the new number without breaking it into digits. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Suppose the original number N is a 6-digit number, so N = 10*x + y, where x is the first 5 digits and y is the last digit (so y is between 0 and 9). For example, if N is 100823, then x is 10082 and y is 3. Then moving the last digit to the front would give us a new number which is 100000*y + x. 

So the equation is:

100000*y + x = 4*(10*x + y)

That's a better way to write it. Let me write that down:

100000y + x = 4*(10x + y)

Let me expand the right-hand side:

100000y + x = 40x + 4y

Now, let's bring all terms to one side:

100000y - 4y + x - 40x = 0

Simplify:

99996y - 39x = 0

Hmm, so:

99996y = 39x

We can simplify this equation. Let's see, 99996 and 39 have a common divisor. Let me check:

Divide both sides by 3:

99996 ÷ 3 = 33332

39 ÷ 3 = 13

So, 33332y = 13x

Therefore,

x = (33332 / 13) * y

Hmm, let me compute 33332 divided by 13. Let me do that division:

13 into 33332. Let's see:

13*2500 = 32500

33332 - 32500 = 832

13*64 = 832, since 13*60=780, 13*4=52, so 780+52=832

So total is 2500 + 64 = 2564

Therefore, 33332 /13 = 2564

Therefore, x = 2564*y

So, x = 2564*y

But remember, x is the first five digits of the original number N. Since N is a 6-digit number, x must be a 5-digit number (since the first digit a can't be zero). Also, y is a single digit from 0 to 9. However, moving the last digit to the front gives a 6-digit number, so the new number starts with y, which must not be zero either. Therefore, y can't be zero. So y is between 1 and 9.

So, x = 2564*y must be a 5-digit number. Let's see what values of y make x a 5-digit number.

Let me compute x for y from 1 upwards until x becomes a 5-digit number:

Starting

---------------

 with y=1:

x = 2564*1 = 2564 → 4-digit, which is too small (needs to be 5-digit). So y=1 is invalid.

y=2:

2564*2 = 5128 → still 4-digit. Not enough.

y=3:

2564*3 = 7692 → 4-digit. Still not 5-digit.

y=4:

2564*4 = 10256 → 5-digit. Okay, so this is acceptable.

Similarly:

y=4 gives x=10256

y=5: 2564*5=12820

y=6: 15384

y=7: 17948

y=8: 20512

y=9: 23076

So, possible y values are 4 through 9. Since we need the smallest original number N, which is 10*x + y, so we need the smallest possible x and y. Since x is 2564*y, and y starts at 4, the smallest y is 4. Let's check y=4 first.

So let's start with y=4:

x = 2564 *4 = 10256

Therefore, N = 10*x + y = 10*10256 +4 = 102560 +4 = 102564

Wait, but let's check if moving the last digit (which is 4) to the front gives 410256, and see if that's equal to 4*N.

Compute 4*N: 4*102564 = 410256. Yes, exactly. Wait, so does this work?

Hold on, let me confirm:

Original number N is 102564. Moving last digit (4) to front gives 410256. 4*102564 is indeed 410,256. So that works. Hmm, so is 102564 the answer?

But wait, the problem says "the smallest possible value of her original number". But wait, let

---------------

 me check if y=4 gives the minimal N. Since y=4 gives N=102564, which is a 6-digit number starting with 1. Let

---------------

 me see if there are smaller numbers with smaller first digits. Wait, 102564 is starting with 1, so that's the smallest possible first digit. But maybe with a smaller y? Wait, y had to be at least 4 to make x a 5-digit number. So the smallest possible y is 4, so N=102564 would be the minimal.

Wait, but hold on a second. Let me check with y=4. Let me verify again step by step:

Original number N = 102564.

Moving last digit (4) to front: 4 followed by 10256 → 410256.

4 times N is 4*102564 = 410,256. So yes, that works.

Hmm, so that seems to work, but wait, the problem is presented as a competition problem, so maybe the answer is different? Because sometimes there might be constraints that I missed.

Wait, but let me check the next

---------------

 possible y to see if there is a smaller N. Wait, no, since y=4 gives the smallest possible N, as higher y's would lead to higher N's. For example, y=5 gives N=10*(2564*5)+5 = 10*12820 +5 = 128205, which is larger. Similarly, so 102564 is the smallest possible?

Wait, but let

---------------

 me think again. Wait, perhaps my approach is missing something?

Wait, the problem states that the original number is a 6-digit number. So moving the last digit to front must also result in a 6-digit number. Therefore, the moved digit (the original last digit) must not be zero. So y can't be zero, which we already considered.

But let me see another way. Let me think in terms of modular arithmetic. Since N is 10*x + y, and the new number is 100000*y + x. So, according to the problem, 100000y + x = 4N = 4*(10x + y). So,

---------------

 same equation as before. So, leading to 99996y = 39x. So x = (99996/39)y = 2564y. So that's correct. So x must be 2564*y, and since x is a 5-digit number, y must be at least 4 (as above). Therefore, the minimal N is 102564. But wait, let

---------------

 me check if 102564 is indeed the minimal.

Wait, but let me check another thing: perhaps

---------------

 there is a smaller number with leading digits less than 102564? Let's see. Let's see what is

---------------

 the value when y=4. The x is 10256, so the original number is 102564. Let

---------------

 me see if there is a smaller y. Wait, y can't be 3, because then x would be 2564*3=7692, which is 4-digit, so N would be 7692*10 +3 = 76923, but that's a 5-digit number, which is invalid. Similarly, y=2 gives x=5128, so N=51282, which is 5-digit. So indeed

---------------

 y must be at least 4. Therefore, 102564 is the minimal.

Wait, but hold

---------------

 on. Wait, in the problem statement, the example given is 100823 becomes 310082. Let me check 4 times 100823 is 403292, which is not 310082. Wait, that example is just an example of moving the last digit to the front, not that it satisfies the 4 times condition. So the example is just to illustrate the operation.

So the example isn't a solution, just an example. So maybe

---------------

 102564 is the correct answer, but let me check again.

Wait, but I feel like maybe there is a smaller number. Let me check with another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps we

---------------

 can think of this as a cyclic number problem or something related. Let me see:

Let me denote N as a 6-digit number. Let me write N as:

N = 10^5 * a + B, where B is the last 5 digits. Wait, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, as

---------------

 before, N = 10x + y, where x is the first 5 digits, so a 5-digit number, and y is the last digit (0-9). Then moving the last digit to the front gives 100000y + x, which equals 4N = 4*(10x + y). So the

---------------

 equation is 100000y + x = 40x + 4y => 99996y = 39x => x = (99996/39)y. Which simplifies to x = 2564y. Since x must be an integer, so y must be such that 2564y is integer, but since 2564 is already integer, any y from 1-9 will do. But x must be a 5-digit number, so 2564y ≥ 10000. 2564*4 = 10256, which is the first 5-digit number. So that

---------------

 gives the minimal N as 102564.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of 99996 divided by 39. Let me check again:

99996 ÷ 39. Let me compute 39*2564:

39 * 2564:

First, 2564 * 40 = 102,560

Subtract 2564: 102,560 - 2,564 = 100,000 - (2,564 - 2,560?) Wait, perhaps better:

2564 * 39:

Breakdown: 2564 * 30 = 76,920

2564 *9 = 23,076

Add them together: 76,920 + 23,076 = 100,  (Wait 76,920 +23,000 is 99,920, plus 76 is 99,996). Wait, so 2564*39 = 99,996. Which

---------------

 is exactly the left side: 99,996 y = 39x, so x = (99996/39)y = 2564y. So that's correct.

Therefore, the calculation is correct.

So then, the minimal N is 102564. But I recall

---------------

 that in some problems like this, the minimal number is 102564, but maybe there's a smaller one?

Wait, perhaps there is a mistake here. Let me check the next possible value. Let me check for y=4, gives

---------------

 N=102564. Let me check if moving the last digit gives 410256, which is 4*102564=410,256. So that works. So that seems to check out.

Alternatively, maybe there is a smaller number where

---------------

 y is higher but x is smaller? Wait, no, because as y increases, x increases as x=2564*y, so higher y gives higher x, leading to a higher N. Therefore, the minimal N occurs at minimal y which is 4, so N=102564. Therefore, the answer is 102564?

Wait, but I remember

---------------

 a similar problem where the answer is 102564, but let me see if that's the case here. Alternatively, maybe I need to check for

---------------

 the cyclic number. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the number must be 6-digit, but when moving the last digit to front, the new number is also 6-digit, so y can't be 0, which we considered.

Alternatively, perhaps there is another solution with a smaller y? But as we saw, y=4 is the first possible y that makes x a 5-digit number. So I

---------------

 think that's correct.

Wait, but let me see another way. Let me suppose that the original number N is 102564. Let me verify

---------------

 once again:

Original number: 102564

Move last digit (4) to front: 410256

4 times original: 4*102564 = 410,256. Which

---------------

 matches exactly. So that works.

Is there a smaller number? Let's see. Let's check y=4 gives 102564. What about y=4 and x=10256. Let

---------------

 me see if there's a smaller N.

Suppose there is a smaller N, say starting with 102... but maybe

---------------

 a smaller 5-digit x?

Wait, but x must be 2564*y, so with y=4, that's the minimal possible. Let's see, if y=4, x=10256, which is the first 5-digit x possible. So that

---------------

's the minimal. Therefore, 102564 is indeed the minimal. 

Alternatively, maybe I can code a small program to check, but since I can't do that here, let me think of another approach. Let me see if there's another way to get a smaller number.

Suppose we model this as a cyclic number problem where multiplying by 4 cycles the digits. Let me think of the number as a 6-digit number, so perhaps we can think in terms of fractions

---------------

. Let me see:

Let me suppose that N is a 6-digit number, and when you move the last digit to the front, you get 4*N. Let me represent N as a number where moving the last digit to front is equivalent to (N mod 10)*10^5 + floor(N/10). So:

Let me denote N as:

Let N = K, so moving last digit to front: ( (K mod 10) * 10^5 ) + floor(K / 10) = 4*K

Therefore:

Let me write this equation:

Let d = K mod 10 (the last digit)

Then, (d * 100000) + (K - d)/10 = 4*K

Multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate the division:

10*d*100000 + (K - d) = 40*K

So:

1000000*d + K - d = 40*K

Bring terms with K to one side:

1000000d - d = 40K - K

So:

999999d = 39K

Therefore, K = (999999 / 39)*d

Compute 999999 divided by 39:

Let me compute 999999 ÷ 39.

39 × 25640 = 39 × 25000 = 975000; 39×640=24,960 → total 975000+24,960 = 999,960

Subtract from 999,999: 999,999 - 999,960 = 39. So 25640 + 1 = 25641.

Thus, 39 × 25641 = 999,999.

Therefore, K = 25641*d

Therefore, K must be equal to 25641*d, where d is a digit from 1 to 9 (since d can't be 0, as before). Since

---------------

 K is a 6-digit number, 25641*d must be a 6-digit number. Let's see what d can be:

25641*1 = 25641 → 5-digit, too small.

25641*2 = 51282 → 5-digit.

25641*3 = 76923 → 5-digit.

25641*4 = 102564 → 6-digit. Okay, so first valid d is 4.

25641*4 = 102,564.

Continuing:

d=5: 128,205

d=6: 153,846

d=7: 179,487

d=8: 205,128

d=9: 230,769

So the possible K values are 102564, 128205, 153846, etc. So the smallest K is 102564 when d=4. Thus, this approach also gives the same result. Therefore, this must be the correct answer.

Therefore, the minimal original number is 102564. 

Wait, but hang on, this contradicts my previous thought that the

---------------

 answer might be different. Wait, but according to this, K = 25641*d, so when d=4, K=102564. So

---------------

 that's correct. Thus, the answer is 102564. 

Therefore, after verifying through two different methods, it seems that 102564 is indeed the correct answer. I think my initial approach was correct, and the second method using the equation rearranged to K = 25641*d confirms it. Therefore, the smallest possible original number is 102564.

**Final Answer**
Answer: 102564


Let \( N \) be the original 6-digit number. When the last digit is moved to the front, the new number is 4 times the original number. We denote \( N \) as \( 10x + y \), where \( x \) is the first 5 digits and \( y \) is the last digit. The new number after moving the last digit to the front is \( 100000y + x \). According to the problem, this new number is 4 times the original number:

\[
100000y + x = 4(10x + y)
\]

Expanding and simplifying this equation:

\[
100000y + x = 40x + 4y
\]
\[
99996y = 39x
\]
\[
x = \frac{99996}{39}y
\]
\[
x = 2564y
\]

Here, \( x \) must be a 5-digit number, so \( 2564y \) must be a 5-digit number. The smallest \( y \) that satisfies this is 4, since:

- For \( y = 4 \), \( x = 2564 \times 4 = 10256 \)

Thus, the original number \( N \) is:

\[
N = 10x + y = 10 \times 10256 + 4 = 102564
\]

Verification:
- Moving the last digit (4) to the front gives \( 410256 \).
- \( 4 \times 102564 = 410256 \), which matches the new number.

Therefore, the smallest possible original number is:

\[
\boxed{102564}
