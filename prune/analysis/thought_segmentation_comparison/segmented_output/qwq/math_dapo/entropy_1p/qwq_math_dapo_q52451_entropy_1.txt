Okay, so I need to figure out the quotient of the count of numbers in the first n rows of Pascal's triangle that are not 1's divided by the count of 1's. The answer is supposed to be in the form (kn² - mn + p)/(qn - r), and then I have to find k + m + p + q + r. Hmm, let me think step by step.

First, let me recall how Pascal's triangle is structured. Each row starts and ends with 1, and the numbers in between are sums of the two numbers above them. The first row is just 1. The second row has two 1's. The third row is 1, 2, 1, and so on. So, for each row number, say row number m, the number of elements in that row is m. Wait, actually, hold on. Wait, the first row is row 0? Or is it row 1? Hmm, the problem says "the first row consists of 1, the second row contains two 1's". So maybe

---------------

 they are counting rows starting from 1. So row 1 has 1 element, row 2 has 2 elements, row 3 has 3 elements, etc. So row n has n elements. So the first n rows would be rows 1 through n. Each of these rows has 1, 2, ..., n elements respectively.

Now, the problem is asking for two counts: the number of numbers that are not 1's in the first n rows, and the number of 1's in the first n rows. Then we need to divide those two counts and express the result in the given format.

Let me start by figuring out how many 1's there are in the first n rows. Since each row starts and ends with 1, except maybe the first row which only has one element (so it's just a single 1). Wait, let's check:

Row 1: 1 → 1 one.

Row 2: 1, 1 → 2 ones.

Row 3: 1, 2, 1 → 2 ones (the first and last elements).

Row 4: 1, 3, 3, 1 → 2 ones.

Wait, so starting from row 2, every row has exactly two 1's, except row 1 which has one. So the total number of 1's in the first n rows would be 1 (from row 1) plus 2*(n - 1) (since rows 2 through n each contribute two 1's). Let me verify that:

Total 1's = 1 + 2*(n - 1) = 1 + 2n - 2 = 2n -1. Wait, hold on, let me check with small n:

For n=1: total 1's should be 1. Plugging in n=1: 2*1 -1 =1, that works.

For n=2: rows 1 and 2. Row1 has 1, row2 has 2 → total 3. But according to the formula 2*2 -1=3, that's correct.

For n=3: rows 1,2,3. 1 +2 +2 =5. Formula gives 2*3 -1=5. Correct again. Okay, so total number of 1's is 2n -1? Wait, but wait, actually when n=4, rows 1-4: 1 +2+2+2=7, and 2*4 -1=7. Yeah

---------------

, so the formula holds. So total 1's are 2n -1. Wait, but hold on a second. Wait, actually, in

---------------

 row 1, there's 1, row 2 has two 1's, row3 has two, row4 has two, etc. So starting

---------------

 from row1, the total is 1 + 2*(n-1). Which simplifies to 2n -1. So that's correct.

Now, the next part is the number of numbers that are not 1's in the first n rows. Let's think. Each row has a certain number of elements, and the

---------------

 number of non-1's in each row would be (number of elements in row) minus the number of 1's in that row.

So for each row i (from 1 to n):

Number of elements in row i is i.

Number of 1's in row i is 1 if i=1, else 2.

Thus, the number of non-1's in row i is:

If i=1: 1 -1 =0

For i ≥2: i -2.

Therefore, the total number of non-1's in the first n rows is the sum from i=1 to n of (number of non-1's in row i).

So that would be:

For i=1: 0

For i=2 to n: (i -2)

Therefore total non-1's = sum_{i=2}^n (i - 2) = sum_{k=0}^{n-2} k (by substituting k = i-2)

Wait, let's check:

When i=2, k=0; when i=n, k =n-2. So the sum is from 0 to n-2 of k.

The sum of integers from 0 to m is m(m+1)/2. Wait, but here m = n-2, so the sum is (n-2)(n-1)/2.

Therefore total non-1's = (n-2)(n-1)/2.

Wait let me verify with n=1, 2, 3, etc.

For n=1: non-1's should be 0. Plugging in n=1: (1-2)(1-1)/2 = (-1)(0)/2=0. Correct.

n=2: non-1's in row2 is 0 (since row2 has two 1's). So total non-1's is 0. The formula: (2-2)(2-1)/2 =0*1/2=0. Correct.

n=3: non-1's in row3 is 1 (since row3 has 3 elements, two 1's, so 1 non-1). So total non-1's is 0 (row1) + 0 (row2) +1 (row3) =1. Formula: (3-2)(3-1)/2 =1*2/2=1. Correct.

n=4: row4 has 4 elements, two 1's, so two non-1's. Total non-1's up to row4 would be 0+0+1+2=3. Formula: (4-2)(4-1)/2 =2*3/2=3. Correct. So the formula holds.

Therefore, the number of non-1's is (n-1)(n-2)/2. Wait, actually, the formula I had was (n-2)(n-1)/2 which is the same. So that's the numerator.

So now, the problem wants the quotient of non-1's divided by 1's. So that's [(n-1)(n-2)/2] divided by (2n -1). So the quotient is [(n² -3n +2)/2] / (2n -1) = [n² -3n +2]/[2*(2n -1)].

Hmm, so let's see. The problem states the original answer is in the form (kn² - mn + p)/(qn - r). Comparing this

---------------

 to our expression:

Numerator: n² -3n +2 → so k=1, m=3, p=2.

Denominator: 2*(2n -1) → which is 4n -2. Wait, hold on. Wait, wait

---------------

. Wait, actually, the denominator in my calculation is 2*(2n -1) ?

Wait, let me recheck:

Wait, the total non-1's is (n-1)(n-2)/2. The total 1's is 2n -1. Therefore the quotient is [(n-1)(n-2)/2] divided by (2n -1) → [(n² -3n + 2)/2] / (2n -1) = (n² -3n +2)/(2*(2n -1)) → which is (n² -3n +2)/(4n -2). So denominator is 4n -2, so q=4, r=2.

So putting into the given format:

Numerator: 1*n² - 3*n + 2 → k=1, m=3, p=2

Denominator:4*n - 2 → q=4, r=2

Therefore, k + m + p + q + r =1 +3 +2 +4 +2 =12?

Wait, but let me confirm once again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in simplifying. Let me re

---------------

-express the quotient again step by step.

Total non-1's: (n-1)(n-2)/2.

Total 1's: 2n -1.

Therefore, the quotient is [(n² -3n +2)/2] divided by (2n -1). So that is equal to (n² -3n +2)/[2*(2n -1)].

Yes, so denominator is 2*(2n -1) =4n -2. So the fraction is (n² -3n +2)/(4n -2). So numerator coefficients: 1, -3, +2. So k=1, m=3 (since it's -m n), p=2. Denominator: 4n -2, so q=4, r=2. So adding them: 1 +3 +2 +4 +2 =12.

Wait, but let me check with n=3. For n=3, the quotient should be 1 (non-1's) divided by 5 (1's) → 1/5. Plugging into the formula: (9 -9 +2)/(12 -2)= (2)/10 =1/5. Correct. Similarly n=4: non-1's are 3, 1's are 7, so 3/7. The formula: (16 -12 +2)/(16 -2)=6/14 =3/7. Correct. So the formula works.

Therefore, the values are k=1, m=3, p=2, q=4, r=2. Adding them together gives 1+3+2+4+2=12.

Wait, but hold on, I just want to make sure that in the problem statement, the original answer is in the form (kn² - mn + p)/(qn - r). So in our case, the numerator is n² -3n +2, so indeed k=1, m=3, p=2. The denominator is 4n -2, so q=4, r=2. So yes, the sum is 1+3+2+4+2=12. So the answer should be 12?

Wait, but wait, let me check again. Wait in the numerator, the problem says "kn² - mn + p", so the coefficients are k for n², -m for n, and +p. So in our case, the numerator is 1n² -3n +2, so m is 3. So that's correct.

Denominator is qn - r, so 4n -2, so q is 4, r is 2. So adding all together, 1+3+2+4+2=12. Hmm, okay, that seems right.

Alternatively, maybe I made an error in counting the number of non-1's?

Wait let's rec

---------------

alculate the non-1's again.

Total non-1's is sum_{i=1}^n (number of non-1's in row i). For row i, the number of non-1's is (number of elements in row i) minus number of 1's in row i.

Row 1 has 1 element, all 1's, so 0 non-1's.

Row 2 has 2 elements, both 1's, so 0.

Row 3 has 3 elements, two 1's, so 1 non-1.

Row 4 has 4 elements, two 1's, so 2 non-1's.

Row 5 has 5 elements, two 1's, so 3 non-1's.

So the pattern is for row i (i >=2), non-1's = i - 2. So the total non-1's from row 1 to n is sum_{i=2}^n (i-2). Which is the same as sum_{k=0}^{n-2} k, since when i=2, k=0; up to i=n, k =n-2. The sum of numbers from 0 to (n-2) is (n-2)(n-1)/2. Which is correct. So that's the same as (n²-3n +2)/2. So that's correct.

Therefore, all steps check out. So the final answer is 12. I think that's it.

**Final Answer**
Answer: 12


To determine the quotient of the count of numbers in the first \( n \) rows of Pascal's triangle that are not 1's divided by the count of 1's, we start by calculating the number of 1's and non-1's in the first \( n \) rows.

**Count of 1's:**
- The first row (row 1) has 1 one.
- Each subsequent row (rows 2 to \( n \)) has 2 ones.
- Total number of 1's: \( 1 + 2(n - 1) = 2n - 1 \).

**Count of non-1's:**
- For each row \( i \) (from 1 to \( n \)), the number of non-1's is \( i - 2 \) for \( i \geq 2 \), and 0 for \( i = 1 \).
- The total number of non-1's is the sum from \( i = 2 \) to \( n \) of \( (i - 2) \):
  \[
  \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i - 2) = \sum_{k=0}^{n-2} k = \frac{(n - 2)(n - 1)}{2}
  \]
- This simplifies to \( \frac{(n - 1)(n - 2)}{2} \).

**Quotient Calculation:**
- The quotient is the ratio of non-1's to 1's:
  \[
  \frac{\frac{(n - 1)(n - 2)}{2}}{2n - 1} = \frac{(n^2 - 3n + 2)/2}{2n - 1} = \frac{n^2 - 3n + 2}{4n - 2}
  \]

The given format is \( \frac{kn^2 - mn + p}{qn - r} \). Comparing coefficients, we find:
- Numerator: \( k = 1 \), \( m = 3 \), \( p = 2 \)
- Denominator: \( q = 4 \), \( r = 2 \)

Summing these values: \( k + m + p + q + r = 1 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 12 \).
