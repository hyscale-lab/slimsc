Okay, let's see. The problem is asking for the least positive integer n such that the product of any n odd consecutive positive integers is divisible by 45. Hmm, right. So I need to find the smallest n where no matter which n odd numbers you pick in a row, their product will be a multiple of 45. 

First, let me recall that 45 factors into prime factors as 3² × 5. So, the product needs to have at least two 3s and one 5 in its prime factors. Since we're dealing with consecutive odd integers, maybe I need to ensure that in any such sequence, there are enough multiples of 3 and 5?

Wait, but they are consecutive odd integers, so the numbers are like 1, 3, 5, 7, 9,... So each step increases by 2. So for example, three consecutive odd integers could be 3,5,7 or 5,7,9, etc. 

So, to have the product divisible by 45, the product must have at least two factors of 3 and one factor of 5. Let me think about how to guarantee that in any such sequence of n terms.

First, let's tackle the divisibility by 5. Since 5 is a prime, we need at least one multiple of 5 in the sequence. The

---------------

 question is, how many consecutive odd numbers do we need to ensure that one of them is a multiple of 5? The spacing between multiples of 5 in the odd numbers is... Well, multiples of 5 are every 5 numbers, but since we're only considering odd numbers, the distance between two odd multiples of 5 would be 10. For example, 5, 15, 25, etc. So between any two odd multiples of 5, there are four other odd numbers. 

Therefore, to ensure that in any set of n consecutive odd numbers, there is at least one multiple of 5, n must be at least 5? Wait, let me think again. Let's see: if you have 5 consecutive odd numbers, like 1,3,5,7,9. Here 5 is a multiple of 5. Another example: 7,9,11,13,15. Here 15 is a multiple of 5. But if you take a sequence starting at 11: 11,13,15,17,19. Here

---------------

 15 is included. Wait, actually, every 5 consecutive odd numbers must include a multiple of 5? Hmm, let's check starting at 9: 9,11,13,15,17. Yes, 15 is there. Starting at 13: 13,15,17,19,21. 15 is still there. Wait, starting at 15: 15,17,19,21,23. Still

---------------

 has 15. Hmm, but what if starting at 5: 5,7,9,11,13. Yes

---------------

, 5 is there. 

Wait, so actually, any 5 consecutive odd numbers must include a multiple of 5? Let me check a different starting point. Suppose starting at 1: 1,3,5,7,9. 5 is there. Starting at 3: 3,5,7,9,11. 5 is there. Starting at 5: already has 5. Starting at 7: 7,9,11,13,15. 15 is there. Starting at 9: 9,11,13,15,17. 15. Starting at 11: 11,13,15,17,19. 15. Starting at 13: 13,15,17,19,21. 15. Starting at 15: same. Starting at 17: 17,19,21,23,25. 25. So yeah, every 5 consecutive odd numbers must include a multiple of 5. Because between any two odd numbers spaced by 4 steps (i.e., 5 numbers), you have a multiple of 5. Wait, actually, the distance

---------------

 between two odd multiples of 5 is 10, so every 5 odd numbers will span a span of 8 (since 5 numbers with step 2 each: 2*4=8). Hmm, maybe my initial thought is right. 

So,

---------------

 for the 5 divisibility, n must be at least 5? But maybe even less? Let me check with n=4. Let's see if there exists 4 consecutive odd numbers without a multiple of 5. For example, 1,3,5,7: has 5. 3,5,7,9: has 5. 5,7,9,11: has 5. 7,9,11,13: 10 is even, so 15 is not here. Wait, 7,9,11,13. The numbers here are 7,9,11,13. None of these are multiples of 5. So here

---------------

's a sequence of 4 odd numbers with no multiple of 5. So that's a problem. So 4 is insufficient. Therefore, to guarantee a multiple of 5, n must be at least 5. So 5 is required for the 5 part.

Now moving on to the 3² part. We need at least two factors of 3 in the product. So, how do we ensure that any n consecutive odd integers will have at least two multiples of 3, or at least one multiple of 9? Hmm, because

---------------

 two multiples of 3 would give two 3s, but a multiple of 9 would give two 3s as well. So either way, we need to have at least two 3s in the product. 

So, let's think of two scenarios: either there are two distinct multiples of 3 in the sequence, or one multiple of 9. Since

---------------

 9 is 3², so if there's a multiple of 9, that contributes two 3s. 

First, let's see how often multiples of 3 occur in odd numbers. The odd multiples of 3 are every 6 numbers. Because every third number is a multiple of 3, but since we're only considering odds, the step between them is 6. For example: 3,9,15,21,... each is 6 apart. So between two odd multiples of 3, there are two other odd numbers. 

Therefore, to have two multiples of 3 in a sequence of n odd numbers, the length must be such that within n numbers, you can't have a gap larger than the distance between two multiples of 3. Wait, perhaps

---------------

 another approach: to guarantee at least two multiples of 3 in any n consecutive odd numbers, how big does n have to be?

Alternatively, the maximum gap between two multiples of 3 in the odd numbers is 6, so to have two multiples, the sequence must span more than that. Wait, let's think in terms of the spacing. Since the odd multiples of 3 are spaced 6 apart, then between them, there are two odd numbers that are not multiples of 3. For example, between 3 and 9: 5,7 are in between. Similarly, between 9 and 15: 11,13. So, if you have a run of 5 odd numbers, could you have only one multiple of 3?

Let me see. Let's try to construct a sequence of 5 odd numbers with only one multiple of 3. Let's see. Starting at 5: 5,7,9,11,13. Here, 9 is a multiple of 3. So that's one. So

---------------

 that's okay. But how about starting at 7: 7,9,11,13,15. Here, 9 and 15 are multiples of 3. So two. Hmm. Starting at 11: 11,13,15,17,19. 15 is a multiple of 3. Only one. Wait, so here's a sequence with only one multiple of 3. So 15 is there. So in 5 consecutive odds starting at 11, we have 15 as the only multiple of 3. Similarly, starting at 13: 13,15,17,19,21. 15 and 21 are multiples of 3. So two. Hmm, so depending

---------------

 on where you start, 5 numbers can have one or two multiples. 

Therefore, 5 numbers might not be enough. Let's see, what

---------------

's the maximum number of non-multiples of 3 between two odd multiples of 3? Between 3 and 9, there are 5,7. Between 9 and 15: 11,13. So two numbers. So the maximum number of odd numbers between two multiples of 3 is two. Therefore, if you have a run of three non-multiples of 3, that's not possible. So between two multiples of 3, there can only be two non-multiples. Therefore, in a sequence of 5 odd numbers, you can have at most two non-multiples of 3 between two multiples, so the

---------------

 total would be 3 multiples? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the maximum number of consecutive odd numbers without a multiple of 3 is 2. For example, between 3 and 9, there are 5 and 7, which are two numbers. So, if you have three consecutive odd numbers, you must contain a multiple of 3? Let's see: 5,7,9. Here, 9 is a multiple. 7,9,11: 9 is a multiple. 9,11,13: 9 is there. 11,13,15: 15 is there. So yes, any three consecutive odds will have at least one multiple of 3. Wait, so that

---------------

's important. So for three consecutive odds, you must have at least one multiple of 3. 

Therefore, in any n consecutive odds, the number of multiples of 3 is at least floor(n/3) or something? Hmm, not exactly. Let me see: since

---------------

 every three consecutive odds must include a multiple of 3, then in n consecutive odds, the number of multiples of 3 is at least ceiling(n/3). Wait, maybe not

---------------

 exactly, but perhaps the minimum number of multiples of 3 in n consecutive odds is floor((n + something)/something). Let's think differently.

Suppose we want at least two multiples of 3 in the sequence. The worst case would be when the sequence starts just after a multiple of 3. Let's see. Suppose starting at 5: 5,7,9,11,13. Here, 9 is the first multiple of 3. Then 15 would be the next. So between 5 and 15, the multiples of 3 are 9 and 15. So in

---------------

 a span of 5,7,9,11,13, there's only one multiple of 3 (9). Then to get another multiple of 3, you have to go to 15. So if I have a sequence starting at 5, with

---------------

 n=5, only one multiple of 3. To get two multiples, the sequence would need to include 9 and 15. So starting at 5, to reach 15, that's 5 numbers: 5,7,9,11,13,15 would be 6 numbers. Wait, 5 to 15 is 6 numbers (since each step is +2). So starting at 5, the first multiple is at 9 (position 3), next at 15 (position 6). Therefore, to have two multiples of 3, you need at least 6 numbers? Let me check. 

Take 5 numbers: 5,7,9,11,13: only one multiple of 3 (9). 6 numbers: 5,7,9,11,13,15: two multiples (9 and15). So 

---------------

6 numbers would guarantee two multiples of 3? Let's see another example. Starting at 7: 7,9,11,13,15,17: multiples at 9 and15. Two. Starting at 11: 11,13,15,17,19,21: 15 and21. Two. Starting at 1: 1,3,5,7,9,11: multiples at 3 and9. Two. So yes

---------------

, in 6 numbers, you have two multiples of 3. However, let me check a shorter sequence. What if n=5? As above, sometimes

---------------

 only one. So n=6 would guarantee two. 

Wait, but let's see if there's a way to have a 6-length sequence with only one multiple of 3? Let's see. Starting at 8? Wait, but we can't start at even numbers. Let's try starting at 14 (but 14 is even, so next odd is 15). Hmm, starting at 15: 15,17,19,21,23,25. Multiples at 15 and21. Two again. Starting at 17:17,19,21,23,25,27: 21 and27. Two. So no, seems like any 6 consecutive odds must include two multiples of 3. Because the spacing between multiples is 6, so in 6 numbers, you can have at most two non-multiples between them? Wait, actually, the distance between multiples of 3 in odds is 6. So every

---------------

 6 numbers, you get a multiple. So over 6 numbers, you must have at least two? Wait, let

---------------

 me think of the first multiple, then 6 numbers later. Wait, perhaps a better way is to note that in any block of 6 consecutive odd numbers, since every third odd number is a multiple of 3, so 6 odds would contain two multiples of 3. Since 6 divided by 3 is 2. Exactly. Because every third odd number is a multiple of 3, so in 3 numbers, 1 multiple, so in 6 numbers, 2 multiples. So yeah, so 6 numbers would have two multiples of 3. Therefore, the minimal n needed for the 3² part would be 6? Because with

---------------

 two multiples of 3, you have at least two 3s. Unless one of them is a multiple of 9, which would give an extra 3. 

Wait, but even if one of them is a multiple of 9, that's still okay. The key is that the product must have at least two 3s. So if you have two multiples of 3, even if one is 3 itself, then 3*3 would give two 3s. Alternatively

---------------

, if one is a multiple of 9 (like 9, 15 is not a multiple of 9, but 9 is), then that's two 3s from that single number. So either

---------------

 way, two multiples of 3 give at least two 3s, so 6 is sufficient. But is 5 sufficient? Let's see. For

---------------

 example, take the sequence 5,7,9,11,13. Here, only one multiple of 3 (9), so only one 3. So

---------------

 that product would have only one 3, which is insufficient for 3². So 5 is not enough. So n=6 is needed for the 3² part.

Therefore, combining both requirements: the product must have at least one 5 and two 3s. 

So for the 5, we needed n at least 5, and for the 3², n at least 6. So the total n must satisfy both, so the maximum of 5 and 6, which is 6. But wait, but maybe there's an overlap? For example, maybe when n=6, we can satisfy both conditions. Let me check.

Wait, but actually

---------------

, the problem says "the product of any n odd consecutive positive integers is divisible by 45". So n must be such that both conditions are satisfied for any sequence. So n

---------------

 must be at least 6 to ensure two 3s, and at least 5 to ensure one 5. Since 6 is larger, that

---------------

 would be the minimal n? But maybe 6 is not sufficient? Let me test with n=6.

Take the sequence starting at 1: 1,3,5,7,9,11. The product includes 3,5,9. The factors of 3: 3 and 9 (which is 3²), so total 3^3. The factor of 5 is 5. So 3²×5 is present. So divisible by 45. 

Another example: starting at 5: 5,7,9,11,13,15. Here, multiples of 3 are 9 and 15 (but 15 is 3×5). So total factors of 3: two (from 9: 3² and 15: 3^1). So total 3^3? Wait, 9 has two, 15 has one. So total three 3s, which is more than enough. Also, the 5 is in 5 and 15. So 5 is present. So divisible by 45.

Another test case: starting at 7:7,9,11,13,15,17. Here, multiples of 3:9 and15. So two 3s (from 9 and15). The 5 is in 15. So 3²×5 is there. Good.

What about starting at 11:11,13,15,17,19,21. Multiples of 3:15 and21. 15 gives 3 and5, 21 gives 3. So total 3^2×5. So yes, divisible by 45.

Starting at 15:15,17,19,21,23,25. 15 gives 3 and5, 21 gives 3. Also, 25 is 5². So 3²×5². Good.

Starting at 17:17,19,21,23,25,27. 21 gives 3, 27 gives 3³, 25 gives 5. So 3^4×5. Okay.

Hmm, seems okay. What about a sequence that might have only one multiple of 5? Let's see. Let's try starting at 1: the first 6 numbers include 5. Starting at 3: 3,5,7,9,11,13. 5 is there. Starting at 5: as before. Starting at 7: includes 15? Wait, 7,9,11,13,15,17. 15 is the 5. Starting at 9:9,11,13,15,17,19. 15 again. Starting at 11:11,13,15,17,19,21. 15. Starting at 13:13,15,17,19,21,23. 15. Starting at 15:15,... so

---------------

 15 is there. Starting at 17:17,... has 25? Wait, 17 to 27: the 5 is in 25? Wait, 17,19,21,23,25,27. 25 is there. So yes, every 6 consecutive odds will include a multiple of 5. Because 

---------------

6 odds span 10 numbers (since 6*2=12? Wait, actually, 6 odd numbers starting at x would be x, x+2, x+4, x+6, x+8, x+10. So the span is 10. So over 10 numbers, there must be at least two multiples of 5, but even one is sufficient here. Wait, but 

---------------

10 numbers would include at least one multiple of 5? Wait, 10 numbers in a row (consecutive integers) will include exactly two multiples of 5, but since we are only taking the odd ones, maybe

---------------

 only one?

Wait, actually, in 6 consecutive odd numbers, the numbers are spaced by 2, so over a span of 10 numbers (from x to x+10). In those 10 numbers, there are two multiples of 5 (since 10 is a multiple of 5). But since we are only taking the odd numbers, how

---------------

 many of those multiples of 5 are odd?

Suppose the starting number is odd. Let me think of an example. Let's say starting at 1: numbers 1,3,5,7,9,11. The multiples of 5 here are 5. So one. Starting at 3:3,5,7,9,11,13. 5 again. Starting at 5:5,7,9,11,13,15. 5 and15. So two multiples of 5. Starting at 7:7,9,11,13,15,17. 15. Starting at 9:9,11,13,15,17,19. 15. Starting at 11:11,13,15,17,19,21. 15. Starting at 13:13,15,17,19,21,23. 15. Starting at 15:15,17,19,21,23,25. 15 and25. So two. Starting at 17:17,19,21,23,25,27. 25. Starting at 19:19,21,23,25,27,29. 25. Starting at 21:21,23,25,27,29,31. 25. Starting at 23:23,25,27,29,31,33. 25 and35? Wait, 25 and 35 would be in the next set. Hmm, 23 to 33: 25 and 35? Wait 23,25,27,29,31,33. The multiples of 5 are 25. 35 is outside. So only one. Wait, 23 to 33: the numbers are 23,25,27,29,31,33. 25 is there. 35 would be the next, but that's beyond. So only

---------------

 one. 

Wait a second, so starting at 23, the six numbers are 23,25,27,29,31,33. Here, 25 is a multiple of 5, so that's one. So okay, still at least one. So

---------------

 in any 6 consecutive odds, you have at least one multiple of 5. Because in 6 numbers, the span is 10 (since 6 steps of 2). Since 10 is a multiple of 5, the

---------------

 span includes at least one multiple of 5. Wait, actually, even more precise: in any 10 consecutive numbers (since

---------------

 the span is 10), there are exactly two multiples of 5. But when taking only the odd numbers within that span, you can have either one or two multiples of 5, depending on where you start. Wait, but in the case starting at 23, the span is 23 to 33. The multiples of 5 in that span are 25 and 30. But 30 is even, so only 25 is included in the odd numbers. So one. Similarly, starting at 25:25,27,29,31,33,35. 25 and 35. So two. 

So in some cases, you can have two, but the minimum is one. Therefore, 6 consecutive odds will always include at least one multiple of 5. So that

---------------

's good. So with n=6, the product will have at least one 5 and at least two 3s, so divisible by 45. 

But wait, let's check the case when n=5. For

---------------

 example, the sequence 1,3,5,7,9. The product includes 3,5,9 (which is 3²). So that's 3²×5, so divisible by 45. Hmm, so that works. Wait, but earlier I thought that n=5 might not be enough because of the 3's part? Wait, but here in n=5, the

---------------

 product can have two 3s (if there is a multiple of 9). Wait, but in some sequences of 5 odds, maybe there is only one 3?

Wait, let's see. Let's take the sequence 5,7,9,11,13. Here, the multiples of 3 are only 9. So that's 3². So the 3 exponent is 2. So that's okay. The

---------------

 5 is there. So 5×3² is present. So divisible by 45. Wait, so maybe even n=5 is sufficient?

Wait, but hold on. Let me think of a sequence of 5 odd numbers that has only one 3 and one 5. Wait, is that possible?

Wait, take 7,9,11,13,15. Here, multiples of 3 are 9 and 15 (since 15 is 3×5). So 9 gives two 3s, 15 gives one 3 and one 5. So total 3³×5. That's okay. Another example: 11,13,15,17,19. 15 is 3×5, so one 3 and one 5. But also 15 is the

---------------

 only multiple of 3. Wait, so total 3^1? Wait no, 15 is 3×5, so that's one 3. But the other numbers: 11,13,17,19 are not multiples of 3. So total exponent of 3 is 1, which is insufficient. Wait, so here's a problem. 

Wait, the sequence 11,13,15,17,19. The product is 11×13×15×17×19. Let's see factors of 3: only in 15. So 15 is 3×5. So the exponent of 3 is 1. So 3^1×5^1. But

---------------

 45 requires 3²×5^1. So that's not enough. Therefore, n=5 is insufficient because in this case, there's only one 3. 

Ah! So that's a key point. So even though some 5-number sequences have two 3s (like the first example with 1,3,5,7,9), there exists a sequence (like 11,13,15,17,19) where there is only one 3. Hence, n=5 is not sufficient. 

So n

---------------

=5 is insufficient. Therefore, n must be 6. Let's confirm with n=6. Let's take the problematic sequence extended

---------------

 to 6 numbers. The previous example with 11 to 19 is 5 numbers. Let's take 6 numbers starting at 11: 11,13,15,17,19,21. Now, the multiples of 3 are 15 and21. 15 is 3×5, and 21 is 3×7. So total 3^2×5×... So that gives us two 3s and one 5. So divisible by 45. 

Another test case: starting at 23, six numbers:23,25,27,29,31,33. The multiples of 3 are 27 (3^3) and 33 (3×11). So two multiples of 3, giving 3^4, and 25 (5²). So that's good. 

Wait, so even

---------------

 the sequence starting at 11, which failed for n=5, when extended to 6, works. So n=6 is sufficient. 

But let's check another edge case. Suppose starting at 15: 15,17,19,21,23,25. Here, multiples of 3 are 15 (3×5) and21 (3×7). So two 3s and one 5 (from 15 and25). 

Another edge case: starting at 5:5,7,9,11,13,15. Multiples of 3:9 (3²) and15 (3×5). So two 3s. 

Wait

---------------

, so all the 6-length sequences seem to have at least two 3s and at least one 5. Therefore, n=6 is sufficient. 

Is there a smaller n? Let's check n=6 is minimal. Since n=5 can fail (as shown), so 6 is indeed the minimal. 

Wait, but let me think if there is a case where n=6 might not have two 3s? Suppose starting at 3: 3,5,7,9,11,13. Multiples of 3:3 (3^1) and9 (3²). So total exponent of 3 is 3. Okay. 

Starting at 7:7,9,11,13,15,17. 9 and15. 9 gives 2, 15 gives 1. Total 3. 

Starting at 9:9,11,13,15,17,19. 9 and15: same as above. 

Starting at 1:1,3,5,7,9,11. 3 and9: 1+2=3. 

Starting at 25:25,27,29,31,33,35. 27 (3^3), 33 (3×11). So two multiples. 

So all

---------------

 sequences of 6 have at least two multiples of 3. Therefore, two 3s at minimum, so the product will have 3²×5. So 45 divides it. 

Therefore, the minimal n is 6. Wait, but let me check n=6 with

---------------

 another example where maybe the 5 is not present? Wait, can a 6-term sequence of odd numbers not include any multiple of 5? 

Wait, let

---------------

's see. Let's try to find 6 consecutive odd numbers with no multiple of 5. Let's see. Let's start at 7:7,9,11,13,15,17. 15 is a multiple of 5. Not good. Starting at 1: includes 5. Starting at 3: includes 5. Starting at 11:11,13,15,17,19,21. 15. Starting at 17:17,19,21,23,25,27. 25. Starting at 19:19,21,23,25,27,29. 25. Starting at 21:21,23,25,27,29,31. 25. Starting at 23:23,25,27,29,31,33. 25. Starting at 27:27,29,31,33,35,37. 35 is a multiple of 5. So 35 is included. 

Hmm, so it

---------------

's impossible to have 6 consecutive odd numbers without a multiple of 5. Because every 5 consecutive odds must include a multiple of 5, as earlier reasoning. Wait, actually, the

---------------

 span of 6 odd numbers is 10 numbers apart. Since 5 divides into 10, so within any 10 consecutive numbers, there must be at least two multiples of 5, but since we are only taking the odd ones, at

---------------

 least one must be present. 

Therefore, 6 consecutive odds must contain at least one multiple of 5. So yes

---------------

, so n=6 is sufficient for both conditions. 

Therefore, the minimal n is 6. 

Wait, but let me check the

---------------

 problem statement again. It says "the product of any n odd consecutive positive integers is divisible by 45". So n

---------------

=6 works, and n=5 doesn't (as shown in the 11-19 example). Therefore, the answer should be 6. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me think again. The problem says "the least positive integer n". So 

---------------

6 is the minimal. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the 3 exponents. Let me verify the case of n=6 with the sequence starting at 11:11,13,15,17,19,21. The multiples of 3 here are 15 (3×5) and21 (3×7). So the total number of 3s is 2. So 3²×5 is present, so divisible by 45. 

Another test: starting at 23:23,25,27,29,31,33. 27 is 3³, 33 is 3×11. So 3^4×5 (from 25). 

Starting

---------------

 at 7:7,9,11,13,15,17. 9 is 3², 15 is 3×5. So 3³×5. 

So all of them have at least two 3s and one 5. 

Therefore, 6 is the minimal n. 

Therefore, the answer should be 6. Wait, but let me check once

 more if there's a case where even with n=6, the product might not be divisible by 45. 

Suppose starting at 1:1×3×5×7×9×11. The product includes 3,5,9 (which is 3²). So 3³×5×... So yes, divisible by 45. 

Another edge case: starting at 49 (just

---------------

 to check higher numbers). 49,51,53,55,57,59. Here, multiples of 3:51 (3×17),57 (3×19). So two 3s. 55 is 5×11. So 5 is present. So divisible by 45. 

Thus

---------------

, I think 6 is correct. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me see if there is a smaller n where maybe

---------------

 the overlapping of conditions could work. For instance, n=5. Suppose there is a case where even with n=5, it's okay? But as we saw, the sequence 11,13,15,17,19 gives a product with only one 3. So that's not enough. 

Alternatively, perhaps n=5 could

---------------

 be sufficient if the multiple of 5 is also a multiple of 9? For example, if the 5 multiple is 15 (which is 3×5), but that only gives one 3. So

---------------

 even if the multiple of 5 is a multiple of 3, you still need another multiple of 3 to get two 3s. 

So in the example starting at 11, the 15 gives one 3, but there's another multiple of 3 at 21 only when you have n=6. So n

---------------

=5 can't reach that. 

Therefore, the minimal n is indeed 6. 

Therefore, the answer is 6. 

**Final Answer**
\boxed{6}


To determine the least positive integer \( n \) such that the product of any \( n \) consecutive odd positive integers is divisible by 45, we need to ensure the product has at least \( 3^2 \) and \( 5 \) in its prime factors.

1. **Divisibility by 5**:
   - The multiples of 5 in odd numbers are spaced 10 apart (e.g., 5, 15, 25, ...).
   - To guarantee at least one multiple of 5 in any sequence of \( n \) consecutive odd numbers, \( n \) must be at least 5. However, checking smaller values, we find that 5 consecutive odd numbers can sometimes exclude a multiple of 5 (e.g., 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 includes 15, but starting at 11: 11, 13, 15, 17, 19 includes 15). However, further

---------------

 analysis shows that any 5 consecutive odd numbers will include a multiple of 5. However, to ensure this, we need to check higher

---------------

 \( n \).

2. **Divisibility by \( 3^2 \)**:
   - The multiples of 3 in odd numbers are spaced 6 apart (e.g., 3, 9, 15, ...).
   - To guarantee at least two multiples of 3 (or one multiple of 9) in any sequence, we need \( n \) to be at least 6. For example, 6 consecutive odd numbers will always include two multiples of 3 (e.g., 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 includes 9 and 15).

3. **Combining Both Conditions**:
   - For \( n = 5 \), there exists a sequence (e.g., 11, 13, 15, 17, 19) that only has one multiple of 3 (15), which is insufficient for \( 3^2 \).
   - For \( n = 6 \), every sequence of 6 consecutive odd numbers will include at least one multiple of 5 and two multiples of 3. Examples:
     - Starting at 11: 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21 includes 15 (3×5) and 21 (3×7), providing \( 3^2 \times 5 \).
     - Starting at 23: 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33 includes 25 (5×5) and 27 (3³), providing \( 3^2 \times 5 \).

Thus, the minimal \( n \) ensuring the product is divisible by 45 for any sequence of \( n \) consecutive odd positive integers is \( \boxed{6} \).<|im_end|>
