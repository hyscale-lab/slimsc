Okay, so I need to figure out how many pairs of cubes in a 3x3x1 block form a line at a 45-degree angle with the horizontal plane. Hmm, let me start by visualizing the cube. The problem mentions a 3x3x3 cube made up of 27 unit cubes, but we're focusing on a 3x3x1 block. Wait, actually, is the 3x3x1 block part of the larger cube? The problem says "from a 3x3x1 block", so maybe the entire structure we're considering is a single 3x3x1 block? Or is it within the 3x3x3 cube? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that first.

Wait, the problem says "A 3×3×3 cube composed of 27 unit cubes rests on a horizontal plane. Determine the number of ways to select two distinct unit cubes from a 3×3×1 block..." So the 3x3x1 block is part of the larger 3x3x3 cube. So each 3x3x1 block is like a horizontal layer or a vertical column? Wait, the problem says "3×3×1 block", so that's a flat block, like a single layer, so 

---------------

3x3x1 would be a horizontal layer, right? Since the cube is resting on a horizontal plane, the horizontal layers are each 3x3x1. So maybe we need to consider all possible 3x3x1 blocks in the cube? Or is the block fixed? Wait, the problem says "from a 3×3×1 block", so perhaps we are to consider any such block in the cube and count for each block the number of pairs in it that satisfy the angle condition, then sum over all such blocks? Or maybe it's a

---------------

 single block?

Wait, actually, the problem says "the line joining the centers of the two cubes forms a 45° angle with the horizontal plane." So the line has to be at 45 degrees from horizontal. Since the horizontal plane is the plane the cube is resting on, the horizontal direction is along the x and y axes, and vertical is z. So the line must be going at 45 degrees from horizontal. That would mean that the vertical component (change in z) is equal in magnitude to the horizontal component (change in x or y or both). But since the cubes are in a 3x3x1 block, which is only 1 unit thick in one direction, maybe z-direction?

Wait, actually

---------------

, a 3x3x1 block can be oriented in different ways. The problem doesn't specify the orientation of the block. Hmm, that complicates things. Because a 3x3x1 block could be aligned along the x, y, or z-axis. Since the cube is 3x3x3, a 3x3x1 block could be any of the three orientations: horizontal (along z-axis, so each horizontal layer is a 3x3x1), or vertical along the x or y axes. Wait, but the problem says "from a 3×3×1 block", so perhaps the block can be in any orientation? Hmm, the problem isn't entirely clear. Wait, let me read the problem again.

"A 3×3×3 cube composed of 27 unit cubes rests on a horizontal plane. Determine the number of ways to select two distinct unit cubes from a 3×3×1 block (the order is irrelevant) such that the line joining the centers of the two cubes forms a 45° angle with the horizontal plane."

Hmm, so it's talking

---------------

 about selecting two cubes within a single 3x3x1 block, and the line between them has to form 45 degrees with the horizontal plane. The key here is that the block is 3x3x1, so it's a flat block, but the

---------------

 orientation isn't specified. So perhaps we need to consider all possible 3x3x1 blocks in the 3x3x3 cube, regardless of their orientation (horizontal, vertical along x, vertical along y), and for each such block, count the number of pairs of cubes within it that form a 45-degree angle with the horizontal plane, then sum all those?

Wait, but the problem says "from a 3×3×1 block", so maybe it's per

---------------

 block, but the question is asking for the total over all such blocks? Or perhaps the problem is just referring to a single 3x3x1 block? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me parse it again.

The problem says: "Determine the number of ways to select two distinct unit cubes from a 3×3×1 block (the order is irrelevant) such that the line joining the centers of the two cubes forms a 45° angle with the horizontal plane."

Ah, maybe it's per

---------------

 3x3x1 block, so the answer is the number for a single such block, but we have to consider all orientations? Wait, but the problem is about a 3x3x3 cube. Maybe the question is asking for all possible such pairs in the entire 3x3x3 cube where the two cubes are part of some 3x3x1 block and the line between them is at 45 degrees? Hmm, the

---------------

 wording is tricky.

Wait, let's see. The problem says "from a 3×3×1 block". So perhaps each pair must be in some 3×3×1 block, and the line between them must form 45 degrees with horizontal. So the total over all such pairs in the entire cube where the pair is contained in at least one 3×3×1 block and their line is at 45 degrees.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking

---------------

 for each 3×3×1 block in the cube, how many such pairs exist in that block, and then sum over all blocks? The wording is ambiguous, but let

---------------

 me think again.

The problem says "the number of ways to select two distinct unit cubes from a 3×3×1 block". The phrase "from a 3×3×1 block" probably means that the two cubes must both be in the same 3×3×1 block, and we need to count all such pairs across all possible 3×3×1 blocks in the cube. So the total number of pairs in any 3×3×1 block (regardless of orientation) that form a 45-degree angle with the horizontal plane.

Alternatively, maybe it's just

---------------

 considering the horizontal 3×3×1 blocks (the layers) and not the vertical ones? But the problem says "a 3×3×1 block", which can be oriented in any direction.

Hmm. Since the problem mentions the cube is resting on a horizontal plane, so the horizontal plane is the base. So vertical is the z-direction. So the 3x3x1 blocks can be in three orientations: horizontal (along z-axis, so each horizontal layer is 3x3x1), or vertical along the x-axis (so each vertical column along the x-direction would be 3x1x3, but that

---------------

's 3x1x3, which isn't 3x3x1), wait, perhaps I need to clarify.

Wait, a 3×3×1 block can be oriented such that its dimensions are 3 along x, 3 along y, and 1 along z (so horizontal layers), or 3 along x, 1 along y, and 3 along z (so vertical along y), or 1 along x, 3 along y, and 3 along z (vertical along x). Each of these orientations is a different 3x3x1 block. So in the cube, there are multiple such blocks in each orientation. For example, there are 3 horizontal layers (z=1, z=2, z=3), but also vertical columns along the x or y directions.

Therefore, the problem is asking for all pairs of cubes that lie within any such 3×3×1 block (regardless of orientation) and such that the line between them makes 45 degrees with the horizontal plane.

So first, we need to consider all possible 3x3x1 blocks in the cube (in all orientations), then for each such block, count the number of unordered pairs of cubes in the block where the line between them forms a 45-degree angle with the horizontal plane, then add them all up. But since

---------------

 some pairs might be in multiple blocks, but the problem says "select two distinct unit cubes from a 3×3×1 block", so each pair is counted once for each block they are in? Or only once even

---------------

 if they are in multiple blocks? Hmm, the wording is ambiguous here too.

Alternatively, maybe it's just considering each 3x3x1 block individually, and for each such block, compute the number of valid pairs in it, and then sum over all blocks. That would make sense, as

---------------

 the problem says "the number of ways to select two... from a 3x3x1 block". Since the blocks can be in different orientations, each contributes their own count. So perhaps

---------------

 that's the approach.

Therefore, we need to compute for each orientation of the 3x3x1 blocks, how many such blocks there are, and for each block, how many pairs in it form a 45-degree angle with the horizontal plane. Then multiply the number of blocks by the number per block (if uniform) or sum appropriately.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to first figure out, for a single 3x3x1 block in a given orientation, how many pairs of cubes in it form a 45-degree angle with the horizontal, then multiply by the number of such blocks in all orientations.

Let me try this approach.

First, let's consider horizontal 3x3x1 blocks (i.e., layers along the horizontal plane, so z is fixed). In such a block, all cubes are in the same horizontal plane. Therefore, any line between two cubes in the same horizontal plane is horizontal, so it would form 0 degrees with the horizontal plane, not 45. Therefore, such blocks contribute nothing. So horizontal layers can be ignored.

Next, consider vertical blocks. Let's consider vertical blocks along the x-axis. That is, the blocks are aligned along the y and z axes, with the x-coordinate fixed. So each such block is a 1x3x3 block? Wait, but the problem states 3x3x1. Wait, orientation matters here. Let me clarify the dimensions.

A 3×3×1 block can be oriented so that its length is along the x-axis (so 3 units in x, 3 in y, 1 in z), or along the y-axis (3 in y, 3 in z, 1 in x), or along the z-axis (3 in z, 3 in x, 1 in y). Wait, perhaps I need to fix

---------------

 an axis.

Let me define the coordinate system. Let’s assume the cube is aligned with the coordinate axes, with the horizontal plane being the xy-plane, so the vertical direction is the z-axis. Then:

- A horizontal 3×3×1 block is along the z-axis, so it's a layer at a particular z-coordinate, with x from 1 to 3 and y from 1 to 3, z fixed. As before, these can't form 45-degree angles with the horizontal.

- A vertical block along the x-axis would have a fixed y and z, varying x from 1 to 3, and varying y and z? Wait, maybe not. Wait, perhaps better to think of the 3×3×1 block as extending in two directions and fixed in the third. So for example:

- If the block is aligned along the x and y axes (so fixed

---------------

 z), that's the horizontal layer.

- If the block is aligned along x and z axes (fixed y), then it's a vertical block extending in x and z, so its

---------------

 dimensions are 3 (x) ×1 (y) ×3 (z). But the problem says 3×3×1, so that would be 3 in x, 3 in z, and 1 in y. Wait, but that is 3×3×1, yes. Similarly, a block aligned along y and z axes (fixed x) would be 1 (x) ×3 (y) ×3 (z). So those are the vertical blocks.

Therefore, there are three orientations for the 3×3×1 blocks:

1. Horizontal (fixed z): 3×3×1 in x,y,

---------------

 fixed z. There are 3 such blocks (z=1,2,3).

2. Vertical along y (fixed y): 3×1×3 in x,z, fixed y. There are 3 such blocks (y=1,2,3).

3. Vertical along x (fixed x): 1×3×3 in y,z, fixed x. There are 3 such blocks (x=1,2,3).

So total blocks: 3 + 3 + 3 =9.

Now, we need to analyze each type of block.

First, let's consider the vertical blocks aligned along the y-axis (fixed y). These are 3×1×3 blocks (x from 1-3, fixed y, z from 1-3). Let's consider one such block. Let me think

---------------

 of coordinates here. Let's say fixed y = k, so coordinates are (x, k, z) where x ∈ {1,2,3}, z ∈ {1,2,3}.

In this block, the cubes are arranged in a vertical plane perpendicular to the y-axis. The horizontal plane is the xy or xz? Wait, the horizontal plane is the original xy plane, so vertical direction is z. Wait, in this block, the coordinates vary in x and z, with y fixed. So the block is vertical in the x-z plane. So in this block, the horizontal direction would be along x, and the vertical is z. Wait, but the horizontal plane is still the original xy plane. Hmm, so the line between two cubes in this block can have both x and z components.

The angle with the horizontal plane is determined by the vertical (z) component and the horizontal component (which would be the projection

---------------

 onto the horizontal plane, so sqrt(x^2 + y^2), but since y is fixed here, the horizontal component between two points in this block would be the difference in x (since y is fixed) and the difference in z is vertical. Wait, actually, the horizontal component is the distance in the horizontal plane between the two points, but since the block is fixed in y, moving along x and z. Wait, actually, in this block, moving along x is horizontal, moving along z is vertical. So the horizontal displacement between two cubes is the

---------------

 difference in x, and vertical is the difference in z.

Therefore, the line between two cubes in this block will have a horizontal component (Δx) and vertical component (Δz). The angle θ with the horizontal plane is given by tanθ = (Δz)/sqrt( (Δx)^2 ). Wait, no. Wait, the angle with the horizontal plane is the angle between the line and the horizontal. The angle θ satisfies tanθ = (vertical component)/(horizontal component). The vertical component is Δz, and the horizontal component is the distance in the horizontal plane between the two points, which in this case, since y is fixed, is sqrt( (Δx)^2 + 0 ) = |Δx|. So tanθ = Δz / |Δx|.

We need this angle to be 45°, so tanθ = 1. Therefore, |Δz| / |Δx| = 1 => |Δz| = |Δx|. So the vertical change must equal the horizontal change (in x direction). Therefore, in this block, pairs of cubes where the difference in z equals the difference in x (in absolute value).

Similarly, for the vertical blocks aligned along the x-axis (fixed x), so coordinates (fixed x, y, z). Wait

---------------

, actually, let's think again. If the block is vertical along the x-axis, then the fixed coordinate is x, so varying y and z. So coordinates are (k, y, z) where y ∈ {1,2,3}, z ∈ {1,2,3}. So similar to the previous case, but now the horizontal displacement between two points would be in the y direction, and vertical in z. So the angle condition would require that the vertical component (Δz) equals the horizontal component (Δy). So tanθ = Δz / |Δy| = 1 => |Δz| = |Δy|.

Therefore, in such blocks (fixed x), pairs where the difference in z and y are equal in absolute value.

Finally, the vertical blocks along the y-axis (fixed y) had

---------------

 the condition |Δz| = |Δx|.

Horizontal blocks (fixed z) can't contribute because their vertical difference is zero, so angle is 0.

Therefore, the contributing

---------------

 blocks are the vertical ones (along x or y axes). So we can compute the number of valid pairs in each vertical block and then multiply by the number of such blocks.

First, let's handle vertical blocks fixed y (so varying x and z). Let's take one such block. Let me model coordinates here. Let's say fixed y = 1. The cubes in this block are at positions (x,1,z) where x and z from 1 to 3. So it

---------------

's a 3x3 grid in x-z plane. Now, we need pairs where |Δx| = |Δz|. So the displacement between two cubes must have equal horizontal (x) and vertical (z) differences.

Possible differences where

---------------

 |Δx| = |Δz|:

Δx can be -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 and similarly for Δz. But since |Δx| = |Δz|, possible cases:

Case 1: |Δx| = |Δz| = 1. So Δx = ±1 and Δz = ±1. So the displacement is like (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1). These correspond to moving diagonally one step in x and one in z.

Case 2: |Δx| = |Δz| = 2. So Δx = ±2 and Δz = ±2. This would be moving two steps in x and two in z.

Case

---------------

 3: |Δx| = |Δz| =0, but that would mean same cube, which is excluded since we need distinct cubes.

So the

---------------

 valid displacements are those with |Δx|=|Δz|=1 or 2.

Now, let's count the number of such pairs in a single y-fixed block.

First, for |Δx|=|Δz|=1. Let

---------------

's see how many such pairs exist.

In a 3x3 grid, moving one step in x and one in z. So starting from any cube, except those on the edges where moving would go out of bounds.

For example, starting at (1,1,1), moving +1 in x and +1 in z would go to (2,1,2). Similarly, other directions. Let's count all possible such pairs.

Alternatively, note

---------------

 that in an n x n grid, the number of such diagonal pairs with step 1 is (n -1)^2 * 2. Wait, in a 3x3 grid, the number of 

---------------

1,1 diagonals:

For the positive diagonal direction (right and up), starting at (x, z), you can go to (x+1, z+1). The number of such steps is (3-1)*(3-1)= 2*2=4 positions where you can start, so 4 such pairs. Similarly, the negative diagonal direction (right and down), (x+1, z-1). But z can't go below 1, so starting from z=2 or 3. Wait, let's do it systematically.

Number

---------------

 of pairs with displacement (1,1):

The starting x can be 1 or 2 (since x+1 must be ≤3), and starting z can be 1 or 2 (z+1 ≤3). So 2*2=4 such pairs.

Similarly, displacement (1,-1): starting x can be 1 or 2, starting z can be 2 or 3 (since z-1 ≥1). So 2*2=4.

Displacement (-1,1): starting x can be 2 or 3 (since x-1 ≥1), z can be 1 or 2. 2*2=4.

Displacement (-1,-1): starting x 2 or 3, z 2 or 3. 2*2=4.

Wait, but each of these counts the same pair twice? Because the

---------------

 pair (A,B) is the same as (B,A). Wait, but in the problem statement, the order is irrelevant, so we need to count unordered pairs. So if

---------------

 I count all ordered pairs and divide by 2, but maybe it's better to think in terms of unordered.

Alternatively, each direction (like (1,1)) gives 4 ordered pairs, but since we are considering unordered, each unordered pair is counted once. Wait, actually, for displacement (1,1), each unordered pair is counted once. For

---------------

 example, the pair between (1,1,1) and (2,1,2) is only in the (1,1) direction. Similarly, (2,1,2) and (3,1,3) is another. So in total for the (1,1) direction, there are 2 in each row? Wait, maybe better

---------------

 to think of the number of such diagonals.

Alternatively, in a 3x3 grid, the number of diagonal pairs with step (±1, ±1):

Each such diagonal of length 2 (since step of 1) has 2 cubes, so the number of such diagonals in each direction:

For the main diagonals (like top-left to bottom-right):

In a 3x3 grid, there are 2 diagonals in the (1,1) direction with length 2: starting at (1,1) going to (2,2), (3,3); but actually, the diagonal from (1,1) to (3,3) has length 2 steps (over

---------------

 3 points). Wait, the number of such pairs would be (3-1) along the main diagonal. Similarly for the other directions.

Wait, perhaps it

---------------

's better to compute as follows:

The number of pairs with Δx=1 and Δz=1:

For each starting point (x,z), if x+1 ≤3 and z+1 ≤3, then the pair (x,z) and (x+1,z+1). The number of such is 2*2=4 (x from 1-2, z from 1-2). Similarly, for Δx=1 and Δz=-1: pairs (x,z) and (x+1,z-1), which requires z-1 ≥1, so z from 2-3, so again 2*2=4.

Same for Δx=-1 and Δz=1: starting x from 2-3, z from 1-2, so 2*2=4.

Δx=-1 and Δz=-1: x from 2-3, z from 2-3, so 2*2=4.

So total for |Δx|=|Δz|=1: 4*4=16? Wait no, each direction gives 4 pairs, so total 4 directions *4? Wait no, wait. Wait, each of the four displacement directions ( (

---------------

1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1) ) has 4 ordered pairs. But since unordered pairs are considered, each unordered pair is counted once in each direction? Wait no, actually, each unordered pair is only counted once in one direction. For example, the pair between (1,1) and (2,2) is only in the (1,1) direction. The pair between (2,2) and (3,3) is also in the same direction. So in total, for the (1,1) direction, there are 2 pairs per diagonal? Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, the total number of unordered pairs with displacement (Δx, Δz) where |Δx|=|Δz|=1 is 4 directions each with (n-1)^2 pairs? Wait in a 3x3 grid, for each of the four diagonal directions (like NE, NW, SE, SW), the number of such pairs is (3-1)*(3-1) =

---------------

4? Wait, no, in each diagonal direction, the number of steps is 2, so the number of edges (pairs) is 2 in each direction. Wait, maybe

---------------

 this is getting too confusing.

Alternatively, let's count all possible pairs where the difference in x and z coordinates are ±1. Let's think of all possible pairs in the 3x3 grid where |x1 - x2| = |z1 - z2| =1. How

---------------

 many such pairs are there?

Let me list them:

For each cell (x,z):

Starting from (1,1):

- Can go to (2,2)

Starting from (1,2):

- Can go to (2,1) or (2,3)

Wait, no. Wait, if

---------------

 starting at (1,2):

To have |Δx|=1 and |Δz|=1, the other cube must be (2,1) or (2,3). So two options.

Similarly:

(1,3):

- (2,2)

(2,1):

- (1,2), (3,2)

(2,2):

- (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3)

Wait, but (2,2) can go in all four directions. Wait, but each

---------------

 of these would have been counted from the other side.

Wait, but if we count all ordered pairs, then for each cell, count the number of neighbors at (±1, ±1), but then divide by 2 for unordered.

Alternatively, let me count all unordered pairs:

Total

---------------

 number of such pairs where |Δx|=1 and |Δz|=1:

Looking at the grid:

The cells are arranged in 3 rows (x from 1-3) and 3 columns (z from 1-3). The diagonally adjacent cells (distance in both x and z of 1) form the pairs.

In each 2x2 square within the 3x3 grid, there are two diagonals. Since the grid is 3x3, there are 2x2 such 2x2 squares in

---------------

 the x-z plane.

Wait, maybe it's easier to count:

Number of such pairs:

In the first two rows and first two columns: the pair (1,1)-(2,2)

Similarly, (1,2)-(2,1), (1,2)-(2,3), (1,3)-(2,2)

Wait, this is getting tangled. Let me think

---------------

 of it as for each cell not on the edge, how many diagonal neighbors they have.

But perhaps it's better to note

---------------

 that in a 3x3 grid, the number of such diagonal pairs is 2*(3-1)*(3-1) = 8? Wait, no. Wait, in each row, except the last, you can have a diagonal to the next row's adjacent column. Hmm.

Alternatively, in

---------------

 each of the 3 rows, except the last one, and for each column except the last one, you have a diagonal pair to the cell (x+1,z+1). So that's 2 rows * 2 columns =4 pairs. Similarly, for the other diagonal direction (x+1,z-1), which

---------------

 would be columns except the first: 2 rows * 2 columns =4. Then the other two directions (starting from the right side or bottom), but since we're considering unordered, those are already counted. Wait, no, actually, the other

---------------

 two directions would be moving left and up or left and down, but those are the same as the reverse of the previous.

Wait, so total for

---------------

 the two diagonal directions (like northeast and southeast?), actually, no, perhaps there are four directions but they form two pairs of opposites.

Alternatively, let

---------------

 me just count all possible unordered pairs:

Looking at all possible cells:

Total cells:9. Each cell can have up to 4 diagonal neighbors (except edge cells).

Let me list all:

(1,1):

neighbors: (2,2)

(1,2):

neighbors: (2,1), (2,3)

(1,3):

neighbors: (2,2)

(2,1):

neighbors: (1,2), (3,2)

(2,2):

neighbors: (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3)

(2,3):

neighbors: (1,2), (3,2)

(3,1):

neighbors: (2,2)

(3,2):

neighbors: (2,1), (2,3), (3,3), (3,1) ?

---------------

 Wait no, (3,2) can go to (2,1), (2,3), and (3,3)? Wait, (3,2) moving in Δx=-1 and Δz=±1 would be (2,1) and (2,3). Also, moving in Δz=1 (Δ

---------------

x=0?), no. Wait no, for (3,2), the diagonal moves would be:

Δx= -1, Δz=1: (2,3)

Δx=-1, Δz=-1: (2,1)

Δx=0,

---------------

 Δz=±1 are not diagonal in both x and z.

So only two neighbors for (3,2): (2,1) and (2,3). Wait, but (3,2) can also go to (3,3) with Δz=+1, but that's only in z, not diagonal.

Wait, I

---------------

 think I need to be strict: only pairs where both Δx and Δz are ±1. So for (3,2):

Δx can only be -1, and Δz can be ±1. So (2,1) and (2,3). Similarly, (3,3):

neighbors: (2,2), (2,4) but z can't be 4. So only (2,2).

Continuing:

(3,3):

neighbors: (2,2)

So let's list all the unordered pairs:

From (1,1): pair with (2,2)

From (1,2): pairs with (2,1), (2,3)

From (1,3): pair with (2,2)

From (2,1): pairs with (1,2), (3,2)

From (2,2): pairs with (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3)

From (2,3): pairs with (1,2), (3,2)

From (3,1): pair with (2,2)

From (3,2): pairs with (2,1), (2,3)

From (3,3): pair with (2,2)

Now, let's list all unique pairs:

1. (1,1)-(2,2)

2. (1,2)-(2,1)

3. (1,2)-(2,3)

4. (1,3)-(2,2)

5. (2,1)-(3,2)

6. (2,2)-(3,1)

7. (2,2)-(3,3)

8. (2,3)-(3,2)

Wait, let's see:

Wait, the pair (2,1)-(3,2) is from

---------------

 (3,2) paired with (2,1), which is already counted as (2,1)-(3,2).

Similarly, (2,2)-(3,1) is from (3,1) paired with (2,2), which was already counted in (3,1)'s neighbor with (2,2). Wait, but (3,1) is only paired with (2,2). So the pair (3,1)-(2,2) is unique.

Similarly, (3,3)-(2,2) is unique.

The

---------------

 pair (2,3)-(3,2) is same as (3,2)-(2,3), which is already listed as 8.

Wait, let me count again:



---------------

1. (1,1)-(2,2)

2. (1,2)-(2,1)

3. (1,2)-(2,3)

4. (1,3)-(2,2)

5. (2,1)-(3,2)

6. (2,2)-(3,1)

7. (2,2)-(3,3)

8. (2,3)-(3,2)

Wait, that's 8 pairs. Wait, but (2,3)-(3,2) is the same as (3,2)-(2,3), which is already counted as 5? No, (2,1)-(3,2) is different from (2,3)-(3,2). Wait:

Wait, (2,3) paired with (3,2) is a separate pair from (2,1)-(3,2). So actually

---------------

:

Looking at all the pairs listed:

1. (1,1)-(2,2)

2. (1,2)-(2,1)

3. (1,2)-(2,3)

4. (1,3)-(2,2)

5. (2,1)-(3,2)

6. (2,2)-(3,1)

7. (2,2)-(3,3)

8. (2,3)-(3,2)

So that's 8 pairs. Wait, but when I look at (2,3) and (3,2), that's pair 8, and (3,2) also pairs with (2,1) in pair 5. So total of 8 pairs.

Wait, but let me recount by

---------------

 considering each possible pair:

The pairs where the coordinates differ by (±1, ±1):

List all possible such unordered pairs:

(1,1) with (2,2)

(1,2) with (2,1)

(1,2) with (2,3)

(1,3) with (2,2)

(2,1) with (3,2)

(2,2) with (3,1)

(2,2) with (3,3)

(2,3) with (3,2)

(3,1) with (2,2)

(3,3) with (2,2)

Wait, but some of these are duplicates. For example, (2,3)-(3,2) is same as (3,2)-(2,3). So total unique pairs are indeed 8? Wait, let's see:

Looking

---------------

 at the list above, the pairs are:

1. (1,1)-(2,2)

2. (1,2)-(2,1)

3. (1,2)-(2,3)

4. (1,3)-(2,2)

5. (2,1)-(3,2)

6. (2,2)-(3,1)

7. (2,2)-(3,3)

8. (2,3)-(3,2)

9. (3,1)-(2,2) [already counted as 6? No, (2,2)-(3,1) is the same as (3,1)-(2,2), which is pair 6]

Wait, pair

---------------

 6 is (2,2)-(3,1), which is same as (3,1)-(2,2). Similarly, pair 7 is (2,2)-(3,3), same as (3,3)-(2,2).

Similarly, pair 8 is (2,3)-(3,2). So total unique pairs are 8. Wait, but (3,3)-(2,2) is pair 7, (3,1)-(2,2) is pair 6, etc. So total 8 pairs.

Wait, but let me count again in another way. Each of the four diagonal directions contributes how much?

For the NE direction (Δx=+1, Δz=+1):

Start at (1,1): goes to (2,2), then (3,3). So two pairs: (1,1)-(2,2), (2,2)-(3,3). But as

---------------

 unordered pairs, those are two separate pairs.

Similarly, starting at (1,2): can't go further in NE beyond (2,3).

Wait, maybe not

---------------

 the right way.

Alternatively, in the grid, the number of such pairs is equal to:

For each possible difference of (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1), count the number of such pairs.

For (1,1): the number of pairs where x2 = x1 +1 and z2 = z1 +1. The number of such is 2 (x from 1 to 2, z from 1 to 2). So (1,1)-(2,2), (2,2)-(3,3). Wait, but (2,2)-(3,3) is another, so actually 2 pairs.

Wait, starting

---------------

 x from 1 and 2, z from 1 and 2, so 2*2=4 ordered pairs? Wait no, the pairs where x increases by 1 and z increases by 1: starting at (1,1), (1,2) can't go to z+1=

---------------

3 with x+1=2, but (1,2) would be (2,3). Wait, actually, for the direction (1,1):

The number of such pairs is (3 -1) choose 1 in both x and z, so 2 in x and 2 in z, so 2*2=4 ordered pairs? But unordered would be the same as the number of edges in that direction.

Hmm, perhaps this is taking too long. Let me just accept that in the 3x3 grid, there are 8 such pairs where the displacement is (±1,±1). So 8 pairs with |Δx|=|Δz|=1.

Now, moving on to displacement with |Δx|=|Δz|=2. That would mean moving two units in both x and z. So for example, from (1,1) to (3,3), Δx=2, Δz=2. Similarly, (1,3) to (3,1), etc.

Let's count these.

Possible displacements:

(2,2), (2,-2), (-2,2), (-2,-2). But in a 3x3 grid, the maximum displacement is 2 (from 1 to 3). So possible pairs are those where the difference in x and z is ±2.

How many such pairs are there?

Starting from (1,1):

Can go to (3,3) (Δx=2, Δz=2).

(1,3) can go to (3,1) (Δx=2, Δz=-2).

(3,1) can go to (1,3).

(3,3) can go to (1,1).

Additionally, are there others?

(1,1) to (3, something else? Δz can't be 2 in another direction. Similarly, (1,2) can't reach with Δx=2 and Δz=±2 because z would go to 4 or 0. So only the four corners can form such pairs.

So the pairs are:

(1,1)-(3,3),

(1,3)-(3,1),

(2,2) can't form such a pair because displacement from center would need to go 2 in both directions, but (

---------------

2,2) to (4,4) is out of bounds.

Wait, only the four corner pairs. So there are two unordered pairs here: (1,1)-(3,3) and (1,3)-(3,1). Because the reverse pairs are the same.

So total of 2 pairs with |Δx|=|Δz|=2.

Therefore, in a single y-fixed vertical block (3x3x1), the total number of pairs with angle 45 degrees is 8 (for step

---------------

 1) + 2 (for step 2) =10.

Wait, but let me verify:

The two longer diagonals (distance sqrt(8)) which

---------------

 have a displacement of (2,2), so the angle would still be 45°, because tanθ = 2/2 =1, so yes, 45°. So those count. The shorter diagonals (displacement 1,1) also give tanθ =1, so they also count. So total 8+2=10 pairs per such block.

Similarly, for the blocks fixed along the x-axis (the other vertical orientation), the calculation is analogous. Let's confirm.

Take a block fixed along the x-axis, say x=1. Then the coordinates are (1,y,z) with y and z from 1-3. So similar to the previous case but with y and z varying. The horizontal direction here is y (since the block is fixed in x, and the horizontal plane is xy), so the horizontal component is Δy, and vertical is Δz. So the condition is |Δz| = |Δy|. So same as before, pairs

---------------

 where the difference in y and z are equal in absolute value.

So the number of such pairs in this block would also be 10, by the same reasoning.

Therefore, each vertical block (fixed x or fixed y) contributes 10 pairs.

Now, how many such blocks are there?

There are 3 blocks fixed along the y-axis (y=1,2,3) and 3 blocks fixed along the x-axis (x=1,2,3). So total of 6 blocks, each contributing 10 pairs, so 6*10=60.

However, wait, we need to check if any pairs are counted multiple times because they belong to more than one block.

For example, consider a pair of cubes that lie in two different 3x3x1 blocks. If such a pair is counted in both blocks, we would be overcounting.

Is this possible?

Let me think. Let's take a pair in the y=1 block (fixed y=1). The

---------------

 cubes must have y=1. So if another block includes them, it must be either another y-fixed block (but y is fixed to 1 already), or an x-fixed or z-fixed block. Wait, actually, a pair in the y=1 block can also be in an x-fixed block or a z-fixed block?

Wait, the

---------------

 other vertical blocks are fixed x or fixed y. Wait, the x-fixed blocks are fixed x, varying y and z. So a cube with coordinates (x,y,z) is in the x-fixed block corresponding to its x-coordinate, and in the y-fixed block corresponding to its y-coordinate. So a pair of cubes with the same y-coordinate (so in a y-fixed block) can

---------------

 also be in different x-fixed blocks unless they share the same x-coordinate. Wait, actually, for two cubes in the same y-fixed block, they have the same y-coordinate, but different x and z.

For

---------------

 example, take two cubes at (1,1,1) and (2,1,2). They are both in the y=1 block. Are they in any other 3x3x1 block?

They could be in an x-fixed block only if they share the same x-coordinate, but here they have different x's. Similarly, they can't be in a z-fixed block because their z's are different. So this pair is only in the y=1 block.

Another example: the pair (1,1,1) and (3,1,3). They are in the y=1 block. Are they in any other block? For

---------------

 example, the x=1 block includes (1,1,1) but not (3,1,3). The x=3 block includes (3,1,3) but not (1,1,1). So they are only in the y=1 block.

Therefore, pairs in a y-fixed block are unique to that block, because

---------------

 their y-coordinate is fixed and they can't be in another block with a different fixed coordinate unless overlapping, but since the other coordinates vary.

Wait, but let

---------------

's consider a pair that lies in two different blocks of different orientations. For example, take a pair that is in both an x-fixed block and a y-fixed block. Suppose two cubes have the same x and same y. Then they would be in both the x-fixed block (for their x) and the y-fixed block (for their y). But in that case, their z coordinates must differ. Wait, but if they have the same x and y, then their line is vertical (along z), which would have an angle of 90° with the horizontal, not 45°, so such pairs wouldn't be counted anyway.

Alternatively, suppose two cubes are in both an x-fixed block and a y-fixed block. For that, they must have the same x (to be in an x-fixed block) and same y (to be in a y-fixed block). Thus, they must share both x and y, so their coordinates are (x,y,z1) and (x,y,z2). The line between them is vertical, angle 90°, so not counted. Hence, any pair counted in our previous calculation (with angle 45°) cannot be in two different blocks of different orientations, because that would require them to have two coordinates fixed, leading to a vertical line.

Therefore, all the pairs we counted are unique to their respective blocks. Therefore, the total is indeed 6 blocks *10 pairs =60.

Wait, but let me confirm with an example. Let's take the pair (1,1,1) and (2,2,2). Wait, hold on, wait

---------------

 a second. Wait, in a y-fixed block (say y=1), the coordinates are (x,1,z). So the pair (1,1,1) and (2,2,2) can't both be in a y=1 block because the second cube has y=2. Wait, no, I

---------------

 made a mistake here.

Wait, actually, in the y-fixed block y=1, all cubes have y=1, so the second cube (2,2,2) has y=2, so it's not in that block. Therefore, my previous examples were correct.

Another example: the

---------------

 pair (1,1,1) and (2,1,2) are in the y=1 block, and nowhere

---------------

 else. Similarly, (1,2,1) and (2,2,2) would be in the y=2 block, etc.

Therefore, all pairs counted in the vertical blocks are unique to their respective blocks, so no overlap. Thus total is 6 blocks *10 pairs each =60.

Wait, but hold on. Wait, let

---------------

 me check the math again.

Earlier, in the vertical blocks fixed y (3 blocks) and fixed x (another 3 blocks). Each contributes 10 pairs, so 6×10=60. But let me check the count again for the 3x3 block.

Earlier, in a single vertical block (fixed y), we had 8 pairs with step 1 and 2 pairs with step 2, totaling 10. Is that accurate?

Wait, in the 3x3 grid, we had 8 pairs with displacement (±1,±1) and 2 pairs with displacement (±2,±2). So total 10. That seems correct.

Therefore, 3 blocks (y=1,2,3) each have 10 pairs, so 3×10=30.

Similarly, the vertical blocks fixed x (x=1,2,3), each also 10 pairs, so another 3×10=30. Total 60. So that seems right.

But wait, let me think of another way. Let's think of all possible lines in the entire cube that form 45 degrees with the horizontal, and see how many of them lie within some 3x3x1 block.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake here because in the vertical blocks fixed x or y, the displacement is in two axes, but maybe there are other orientations where the 45-degree lines could be in different planes?

Wait, but the problem specifies that the two cubes must be in a 3x3x1 block. So the pairs must lie within such a block, so our initial approach is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I missed the vertical blocks along the z-axis? Wait, no, the 3x3x1 blocks along the z-axis are the horizontal layers, which we already determined can't contribute because they are horizontal.

Therefore, the total number should be 60. But let me think again.

Wait, but

---------------

 the problem says "a 3×3×1 block". So each such block is either horizontal or vertical. We considered all vertical ones (along x or y). So total 6 blocks, each with 10 pairs, totaling 60.

But let me check

---------------

 with a smaller example. Let's take a single vertical block fixed y=1. Let me count the pairs again.

Take coordinates (x,1,z). The pairs with |Δx|=|Δz|:

For displacement (1,1):

(1,1,1) and (2,1,2),

(2,1,2) and (3,1,3),

(1,1,2) and (2,1,3),

Wait, hold on, wait

---------------

 a second! Wait, in my previous analysis, I considered the coordinates in terms of x and z, but actually, in 3D, the vertical blocks fixed y have coordinates (x, y, z), so in the block y=1, the coordinates are (x,1,z). The displacement in x and z must satisfy |Δx|=|Δz|.

Wait, but in my earlier analysis, I considered the x-z plane as a 2D grid, so treating x and z as the two varying coordinates, so the analysis holds. But when I listed the pairs earlier, I considered (

---------------

1,1) to (2,2), which would correspond to (x,z) pairs. So translating back, (1,1) in x-z would be (x=1,z=1), so the cube (1,1,1). Then (2,2) would be (2,1,2). So yes, that pair is valid.

But in my earlier count for the 3x3 grid (x and z), I had 8+2=10 pairs, which seems correct. So 

---------------

10 per block.

Alternatively, let's list all 10 pairs in the y=1 block:

First, the displacement (±1,±1):

The

---------------

 eight pairs:

1. (1,1,1) - (2,1,2)

2. (1,1,2) - (2,1,3)

3. (2,1,1) - (3,1,2)

4. (2,1,2) - (3,1,3)

5. (1,1,2) - (2,1,1) [Wait, no, displacement here would be Δx=+1, Δz=-1]

Wait, let me do this systematically:

Pairs with Δx=+1 and Δz=+1:

(1,1,1)-(2,1,2),

(1,1,2)-(2,1,3),

(2,1,1)-(3,1,2),

(2,1,2)-(3,1,3).

That's four pairs.

Pairs with Δx=+1 and Δz=-1:

(1,1,3)-(2,1,2),

(2,1,3)-(3,1,2).

Wait, (1,1,3) can go to (2,1,2),

(2,1,3) to (3,1,2),

and also (1,1,2) can go to (2,1,1),

(2,1,2) to (3,1,1).

Wait, so:



---------------

Δx=+1, Δz=-1:

(1,1,2)-(2,1,1),

(1,1,3)-(2,1,2),

(2,1,2)-(3,1,1),

(2,1,3)-(3,1,2).

That's four pairs.

Similarly, Δx=-1, Δz=+1:

These would be the reverse of the first set, so already counted as unordered pairs.

Wait no, Δ

---------------

x=-1 and Δz=+1 would mean going left in x and up in z.

For example:

(2,1,1)-(1,1,2),

(3,1,1)-(2,1,2),

(2,1,2)-(1,1,3),

(3,1,2)-(2,1,3),

but these are the same as the previous pairs counted in the Δx=+1, Δz=-1 direction when reversed.

Since we are counting unordered pairs, those are already included.

Similarly for Δx=-1, Δz=-1: those would be the reverse of the Δx=+1, Δz=+1 pairs.

Therefore, total for displacement ±1 in both directions is 4+4=8 pairs.

Then the displacement of ±2:

(1,1,1) - (3,1,3),

(1,1,3) - (3,1,1).

That's two pairs.

Total 10. So that checks out.

Therefore, each such block indeed has 10 pairs. So 6 blocks give 60.

But wait, the problem says "the number of ways to select two distinct unit cubes from a 3×3×1 block". So if we have multiple blocks, each contributes their own pairs, and since the pairs are unique to each block, the total is 6×10=60.

But let me confirm once more.



---------------

Wait, another thought: are there any 3x3x1 blocks oriented along the z-axis? Wait, the horizontal layers are 3x3x1 along the z-axis. But we determined those can't have any pairs with 45 degrees, so they contribute 0. So total is indeed 60.

But let me think of another perspective. Let's imagine all possible lines in the cube that form 45 degrees with the horizontal. Such lines must have a vertical component equal in magnitude to their horizontal component.

The horizontal component is the distance in the x-y plane, and vertical is z.

So for a line between two cubes, let the coordinates be (x1,y1,z1) and (x2,y2,z2). The horizontal distance squared is (Δx)^2 + (Δy)^2, and vertical distance is Δz. The angle θ with horizontal satisfies tanθ = |Δz| / sqrt( (Δx)^2 + (Δy)^2 ). We need tanθ =1, so |Δz| = sqrt( (Δx)^2 + (Δy)^2 ).

Thus, the vertical difference must equal the horizontal distance. So possible

---------------

 cases where this can happen?

This can occur in two ways:

1. The horizontal displacement is 1 unit and vertical displacement is 1 unit (so sqrt(1) =1).

2. The horizontal displacement is sqrt(2) units (i.e., moving 1 in x and 1 in y) and vertical displacement is sqrt(2), but since we are dealing with unit cubes, the vertical displacement must be integer. So sqrt(2) is not integer, so this is impossible.

Wait, but

---------------

 vertical displacement must be an integer (since cubes are separated by integer units in z). The horizontal distance must also be an integer or sqrt(2). Hmm

---------------

, so the only possibilities are:

Either the horizontal displacement is 1 in one axis (so Δx=±1 or Δy=±1) and vertical displacement 1, but also combined displacements where horizontal displacement squared is 1 (so Δx or Δy is ±1, the other 0) and Δz=±1.

Or, horizontal displacement squared is 2 (Δx=±1 and Δy=±1) and Δz=±√2, but since z must be integer, this is impossible.

Alternatively, horizontal

---------------

 displacement squared must be equal to (Δz)^2. Since Δz is integer, then (Δz)^2 must equal (Δx)^2 + (Δy)^2.

Thus, the possible solutions are when (Δx, Δy, Δz) is such that (Δx)^2 + (Δy)^2 = (Δz)^2.

Possible small integer solutions:

- (Δx, Δy, Δz) = (±1, 0, ±1), (0, ±1, ±1): here, 1 +0 =1, so yes.

- (±1, ±1, ±√2): but √2 isn't integer.

- (0,0,0): same cube.

- (2,0, ±2): 4 +0=4, so yes.

- (0,2, ±2): same.

- (1,1, ±√2): nope.

- (3,0, ±3): but in a 3x3x3 cube, the max Δz is 2 (from z=1 to 3).

Wait, in a 3x3x3 cube, the maximum Δz is 2 (between z=1 and z=3). Similarly, Δx or Δy can be up to 2.

Thus, possible vectors where (Δx)^2 + (Δy)^2 = (Δz)^2 are:

1. (Δx, Δy, Δz) = (±1, 0, ±1), (0, ±1, ±1)

2. (±2, 0, ±2), (0, ±2, ±2)

These

---------------

 are the only possibilities with integer coordinates within the cube.

Therefore, the lines forming 45° with the horizontal must have either:

- A horizontal step of 1 in x or y, and vertical step of 1.

- A horizontal step of 2 in x or y, and vertical step of 2.

Thus

---------------

, the pairs must be separated by either (1,0,1), (0,1,1), (2,0,2), or (0,2,2), and their negatives.

Now, we need to count all such pairs in the entire cube, but only those that lie within some 3×3×1 block.

Wait, but the problem requires that the two cubes are selected from a single 3×3×1 block, so the pair must be contained within such a block.

Therefore, we can model

---------------

 this as follows:

For each such vector (Δx, Δy, Δz), we need to see if there exists a 3×3×1 block that contains both cubes.

Let's analyze each case.

First, the vectors with (Δx, Δy, Δz) = (±1, 0, ±1):

This

---------------

 corresponds to moving 1 in x, 0 in y, and 1 in z. So, for example, from (x,y,z) to (x+1,y,z+1). For

---------------

 such a pair to lie in a 3×3×1 block, the block must include both these cubes.

A 3×3×1 block is aligned along two axes. Let's see:

If the block is fixed along y (so varying x and z), then yes, since

---------------

 y is fixed, and both cubes have the same y-coordinate. So as long as the y-coordinate is the same, they are in a y-fixed block.

Similarly, if the displacement is (0,1,1), then the

---------------

 cubes have the same x-coordinate, so they can be in an x-fixed block (varying y and z).

Similarly for the negative directions.

So pairs with (Δx, ±1, Δz=±1) and

---------------

 (Δy, ±1, Δz=±1) can be in either y-fixed or x-fixed blocks respectively.

Similarly for the (2,0,2) vectors: moving 2 in x and 2 in z. These would require that the two cubes are in a y-fixed block, with x differing by 2 and z differing by 2, which is allowed in a 3×3×1 block (since the block has x from 1-3 and z from 1-3, so moving

---------------

 2 in both is possible from (1, y, 1) to (3, y, 3)).

Similarly for (0,2,2).

Therefore, all these vectors correspond to pairs that lie within some 3×3×1 block.

Therefore, to find the total number, we can compute the number of such pairs in the cube and ensure they are counted only once per block. But since our previous method counted per block and summed

---------------

, giving 60, that should be correct.

Alternatively, let's compute using this method:

First, count all pairs with vector (1,0,1):

For each cube (x,y,z), check if (x+1,y,z+1) is also a cube. The number of such pairs is:

x can be from 1 to 2 (since x+1 ≤3),

z can be from 1 to 2 (since z+1 ≤3),

y can be anything from 1 to 3.

Thus, the number is 2 (x) * 2 (z) *3 (y) = 12. But since each pair is counted once (as ordered?), but we want unordered, so actually, each such pair is unique, so 12.

Similarly for (-1,0,-1): same as the reverse, so already counted.

Similarly for (1,0,-1): moving

---------------

 in x+1, z-1. Here, z must be ≥2.

Number of such pairs:

x from 1-2,

z from 2-3,

y from 1-3.

2*2*3=12.

Similarly for (-1,0,1): x from 2-3, z from 1-2, 2*2*3=12.

Wait, but this

---------------

 is getting too involved. Alternatively, for each direction:

For vectors (±1,0,±1):

There are four directions: (1,0,1), (1,0,-1), (-1,0,1), (-1,0,-1).

Each direction contributes 2*2*3=12 ordered pairs, but since unordered, each unordered pair is counted twice except when the vector is its own inverse, which it isn't. So total for all four directions is (4*12)/2=24.

Wait, no, perhaps better:

The number of unordered pairs with Δx=±1 and Δz=±1, Δy=0:

For each cube (x,y,z), the number of neighbors at (x±1,y,z±1) with same y.

As before, in the y-fixed blocks, these

---------------

 are the same as the pairs we counted earlier.

But this is getting complex. Since we already have a consistent count of 60 via the first method, perhaps it's safe to go with that.

Therefore, the final answer is 60. Wait, but let me see.

Wait, in each y-fixed block, there are 10 pairs. There are 3 y-fixed blocks and 3 x-fixed blocks, so 6 blocks. 6×10=60. So the answer should be 60?

But let me confirm with an example.

Take the y=1 block:

It has 10 pairs. Similarly, the x=1 block also has 10 pairs. Let

---------------

's see if there is overlap between them.

Take a pair in the x=1 block: say (1,1,1) and (1,2,2). This pair has Δy=1 and Δz=1, so it's in the x=1 block (since x is fixed at 1). This pair cannot be in a y-fixed block because their y's are different. Similarly, pairs

---------------

 in x=1 are unique to x=1.

Thus, all pairs are unique to their respective blocks, so total is indeed 6×10=60.

Wait, but wait

---------------

 a second. Let's think of the pair (2,2,2) and (3,2,3). This is in the y=2 block. Also, is this pair present in any other block? For instance, is there a z-fixed block? Wait, z-fixed blocks are horizontal layers. The pair has different z's (2 and 3), so they can't be in the same horizontal layer. So no overlap.

Thus, I think the total is 60.

But let me check the

---------------

 problem statement once again to ensure I didn't misinterpret.

"A 3×3×3 cube composed of 27 unit cubes rests on a horizontal plane. Determine the number of ways to select two distinct unit cubes from a 3×3×1 block (the order is irrelevant) such that the line joining the centers of the two cubes forms a 45° angle with the horizontal plane."

Yes, so it's the total over all 3×3×1 blocks of the number of such pairs in each block. Since each pair is only in one block, it's 6×10=60.

Wait, but hold

---------------

 on! Wait, the problem says "from a 3×3×1 block", so maybe it's per block, but the question is asking for the total over all such blocks? Yes, the wording is "the number of ways to select two...", so it's the total number across all blocks. So 60 is the answer.

However, let me think again about the vertical blocks along the z-axis. Wait no, those are the horizontal layers, which don't contribute.

Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation in the number of pairs per block.

Wait, in each vertical block (either x or y fixed), we had 10 pairs. Let me recount for a specific block.

Take the block fixed at y=1:

The pairs are those with |Δx|=|Δz|.

As

---------------

 listed before, there are 10 pairs. Let's count them again:

Displacement (1,1):

(1,1,1)-(2,1,2)

(2,1,2)-(3,1,3)

(1,1,2)-(2,1,3)

(2,1,3) can't go further in x.

Wait no, actually

---------------

, in displacement of (1,1), starting from x=1,z=1 to x=2,z=2, etc.:

The four pairs with step (1,1):

(1,1,1)-(2,1,2),

(2,1,2)-(3,1,3),

(1,1,2)-(2,1,3),

(1,1,3) can't go further in x (

---------------

since z would go to 4),

Wait, no, (1,1,1) to (2,1,2),

(1,1,2) to (2,1,3),

(2,1,1) to (3,1,2),

(2,1,2) to (3,1,3),

so that's four pairs.

Similarly for (1,-1):

(1,1,3)-(2,1,2),

(2,1,2)-(3,1,1),

(1,1,2)-(2,1,1),

(2,1,3)-(3,1,2).

That's four more.

Then the two with displacement (2,2):

(1,1,1)-(3,1,3),

(1,1,3)-(3,1,1).

Total 4+4+2=10. Yes.

So that's correct.

Therefore, the total is 6×10=60.

Hmm, but I feel like I might have missed something. Let me think of the cube's total possible pairs.

The total number of pairs in the entire cube is C(27,2)=351. We're only counting those pairs that lie within some 3×3×1 block and form a 45° angle.

Alternatively, maybe I need

---------------

 to consider that in addition to the vertical blocks along x and y, there are also vertical blocks along z? Wait, no, a vertical block along z would be 3×1×3, but oriented

---------------

 along z? Wait, actually, a 3×3×1 block can also be oriented along the z-axis as 3×3×1 in x,y,z? Wait, no, the 3×3×1 block must have one dimension of 1. So along z-axis, it would be fixed z, hence horizontal layer.

Therefore, only

---------------

 the vertical blocks along x and y contribute, totaling 6 blocks, 10 each: 60.

Alternatively, let me think of another way. For each of the 3 layers (horizontal), there are 0 pairs. For each of the 3 vertical slices along the x-axis (fixed x), 10 pairs each. Similarly, 3 vertical slices along y-axis, 10 each. Total 6×10=60.

Yes, this seems consistent.

Therefore, I think the answer is 60. But to be thorough, let me see if any other pairs could be counted.

Wait, what

---------------

 about pairs in the z-fixed blocks? For example, a horizontal layer (fixed z). In such a layer, all pairs are in the horizontal plane, so angle 0°, so no. So no contribution.

Therefore, I believe the correct answer is 60. But wait, hold on, let me check an example with coordinates

---------------

.

Take the pair (1,1,1) and (2,1,2): this is in the y=1 block, counted there.

Pair (1,2,1) and (2,2,2): in y=2 block.

Pair (2,3,1) and (3,3,2): in y=3 block.

Similarly, in x=1 block, pairs like (1,1,1)-(1,2,2), (1,2,1)-(1,3,2), etc.

All of these are unique to their blocks.

Therefore, I think the answer is 60. Wait, but I recall that in some similar problems, the answer might be different. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps I overcounted by a factor. Wait, in each vertical block, there are 10 pairs, but maybe

---------------

 some of these pairs are counted in two different blocks of the same orientation?

Wait, for example, take the pair (2,1,2) and (3,1,3). This is in the y=1 block. Could it also be in another y=1 block? No, since y is fixed. Or in an x=2 block?

The x=2 block includes cubes with x=2, varying y and z. So (2,1,2) and (3,1,3) have x=2 and x=3, so they can't both be in the x=2 block. So no overlap.

Thus, I think the count is correct.

Therefore, I will go with 60 as the answer.

**Final Answer**
Answer: 60


To determine the number of ways to select two distinct unit cubes from a \(3 \times 3 \times 1\) block such that the line joining their centers forms a \(45^\circ\) angle with the horizontal plane, we analyze the possible orientations of the \(3 \times 3 \times 1\) blocks and the valid pairs within each block.

### Key Steps:

1. **Orientation of Blocks**:
   - **Horizontal blocks**: These are layers fixed along the z-axis. Since they are horizontal, the line joining any two cubes in the same layer is horizontal, so they do not form a \(45^\circ\) angle. These contribute 0 pairs.
   - **Vertical blocks**:
     - **Fixed y-coordinate**: These blocks are aligned along the x and z axes (e.g., fixed y = 1, 2, or 3).
     - **Fixed x-coordinate**: These blocks are aligned along the y and z axes (e.g., fixed x = 1, 2, or 3).

2. **Valid Pairs in Vertical Blocks**:
   - For a vertical block fixed along the y-axis (e.g., y = k), the coordinates are \((x, k, z)\). The line between two cubes must have equal horizontal (x) and vertical (z) differences. This results in pairs where \(|\Delta x| = |\Delta z|\).
   - Similarly, for a vertical block fixed along the x-axis (e.g., x = k), the coordinates are \((k, y, z)\). The line between two cubes must have equal horizontal (y) and vertical (z) differences, resulting in pairs where \(|\Delta y| = |\Delta z|\).

3. **Counting Pairs**:
   - In each vertical block (fixed y or x), the valid pairs are those with \(|\Delta x| = |\Delta z|\) or \(|\Delta y| = |\Delta z|\).
   - For a \(3 \times 3\) grid (either in x-z or y-z plane), the valid pairs are:
     - **Step 1**: Pairs with \(\Delta x = \pm 1\) and \(\Delta z = \pm 1\) (or similar for y and z), resulting in 8 pairs.
     - **Step 2**: Pairs with \(\Delta x = \pm 2\) and \(\Delta z = \pm 2\) (or similar for y and z), resulting in 2 pairs.
   - Total pairs per vertical block: \(8 + 2 = 10\).

4. **Total Count**:
   - There are 3 vertical blocks fixed along the y-axis and 3 vertical blocks fixed along the x-axis, totaling 6 blocks.
   - Each block contributes 10 pairs, leading to \(6 \times 10 = 60\) pairs.
