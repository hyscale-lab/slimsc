Okay, so I have this problem here: For each positive integer n, S(n) is the sum of the digits of n. I need to find how many values of n satisfy the equation n + S(n) + S(S(n)) = 2007. Hmm, alright. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First off, I know that S(n) is the sum of the digits of n. So, for example, if n is 123, then S(n) would be 1+2+3=6. Then S(S(n)) would be S(6)=6. So in that case, n + S(n) + S(S(n)) would be 123+6+6=135. But in our problem, we need this sum to be 2007. 

The question is asking for how many such n exist. Alright, so I need to find all n where when you add the number itself, the sum of its digits, and the sum of the digits of that sum, you get 2007. 

Let me think about possible strategies here. Since the equation involves n and its digit sums, maybe I can find some bounds on n first. Let's see. Since S(n) is at most 9 times the number of digits of n. For example, if n is a 4-digit number, the maximum S(n) would be 9*4=36, and then S(S(n)) would be at most S(36)=3+6=9. So the total maximum contribution from S(n) and S(S(n)) for a 4-digit number would be 36 + 9 = 45. Therefore, n must be at least 2007 - 45 = 1962. Wait, but that might not be precise because S(n) can be smaller. Hmm, maybe I need to get tighter bounds.

Alternatively, maybe I can express

---------------

 n in terms of the equation. Let me rearrange the equation:

n = 2007 - S(n) - S(S(n))

So n must be equal to 2007 minus the sum of its digits and the sum of the digits of that sum. Since S(n) and S(S(n)) are both positive integers, n must be less than 2007. So n is in the range 1 to 2006. But actually

---------------

, since S(n) can't be too big, maybe n is closer to 2007. Let me see.

Let me think about the maximum possible value of S(n) for a number n less than 2007. The maximum S(n) would be for the number 1999, which has digits 1+9+9+9=28. Then S(S(n)) would be S(28)=10, so S(S(n)) is 10. Therefore, the maximum possible value of S(n) + S(S(n)) would be 28 + 10 = 38. Therefore, the minimal n would be 2007 - 38 = 1969. Wait, so n has to be between 1969 and 2006? Because n = 2007 - (S(n) + S(S(n))), and S(n) + S(S(n)) is at least, say, 1 + 1 = 2 (for n=1, but n is up to 2006). But actually, since n is close to 2007, maybe the lower bound is 1969. Hmm, okay

---------------

. So n is in the range 1969 to 2006. That narrows it down a bit.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of modulo 9. Because the sum of the digits of a number is congruent to the number modulo 9. So S(n) ≡ n mod 9, and then S(S(n)) would also be ≡ S(n) mod 9, so S(S(n)) ≡ n mod 9 as well. Therefore, the equation becomes n + S(n) + S(S(n)) ≡ n + n + n ≡ 3n mod 9. Since 2007 is divisible by 9, because 2+0+0+7=9, which is divisible by 9. So 2007 ≡ 0 mod 9. Therefore, 3n ≡ 0 mod 9 ⇒ n ≡ 0 mod 3. So n must be a multiple of 3. That's a useful piece of information. So n must be divisible by 3. That reduces the possible candidates.

So n must be between 1969 and 2006, divisible by 3, so let's see. Let me note

---------------

 that 2007 divided by 3 is 669, so 2007 is a multiple of 3, so numbers around that would be multiples of 3. Let me compute the lower bound again. Wait, the

---------------

 maximum S(n) + S(S(n)) is 38 as above, so n is at least 2007 - 38 = 1969. But 

---------------

1969 divided by 3 is approximately 656.333. So the first multiple of 3 in that range would be 1970? Wait, 1969 divided by 3 gives a remainder. Let me check 1969 mod 3. 1+9+6+9 = 25, 2+5=7, so 7 mod 3 is 1. So 1969 mod 3 is 1, so the next number divisible by 3 is 1970? 1+9+7+0=17, 1+7=8, so 8 mod 3 is 2. Hmm, not

---------------

. Wait maybe I should compute 1969 divided by 3. 3*656=1968, so 1969 is 1968 +1, so yes, remainder 1. So next multiple of 3 is 1971. So starting from 1971 up to 2007, but n must be less than 2007, so up to 2004. Wait 2004 is the last multiple of 3 before 2007. So the possible n's are from 1971 to 2004, stepping by 3. Let me confirm that upper bound. The maximum n is 2006, but 2004 is the last multiple of 3 below 2007. So n can be from 1971 to 2004, in steps of 3. That's (2004 - 1971)/3 +1 = (33)/3 +1 = 11 +1 = 12 numbers? Wait, maybe not. Let me compute how many terms: The numbers are 1971, 1974,...,2004. The number of terms is ((2004 -1971)/3)+1 = (33/3)+1=11+1=12. So 12 numbers. But maybe

---------------

 not all of them will satisfy the equation. So I need to check each of these 12 numbers? Hmm, but maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, maybe I can let n = 2007 - S(n) - S(S(n)). Since n must be equal to that, so perhaps

---------------

 I can denote x = S(n), then S(S(n)) is S(x). So the equation becomes n = 2007 - x - S(x). Then, since x is the sum of the digits of n, which is S(n) = x, so we can write n = 2007 - x - S(x). Therefore, if

---------------

 I can find x such that when you compute n as 2007 - x - S(x), then S(n) = x. So this

---------------

 is a system where x must be the digit sum of n, and n must be 2007 - x - S(x). So perhaps I can loop over possible x values and see if the corresponding n has digit sum x. 

So first, I need to find possible x's. Since x = S(n), and n is between 1969 and 2006, let's see what possible values x can take. The minimal digit sum for numbers in that range: the smallest number is 1969, so its digit sum is 1+9+6+9=25. The largest number is 2006, digit sum is 2+0+0+6=8. Wait, wait a second. Wait, 2006 is 2+0+0+6=8? Wait that's way lower. Hmm, so actually the digit sums can vary quite a bit. Wait, maybe

---------------

 my previous assumption about the maximum S(n) was wrong. Let me check.

Wait, 1999 has a digit sum of 1+9+9+9=28. 2006 is 2+0+0+6=8. So actually, the maximum digit sum in that range (1969 to 2006) would be 28, as in 1999, and the minimum digit sum is 8 (for 2006) or maybe even lower. Wait, 1980 would be 1+9+8+0=18. Hmm. Wait, actually

---------------

, the minimal digit sum would be for 2000, which is 2, but 2000 is not in the range (since n has to be less than 2007, but 2000 is okay). Wait, 2000 is 2+0+0+0=2. So the digit sums can range from 2 up to 28. However, since n must be between 1969 and 2006, let

---------------

's see:

Wait, 1969's digit sum is 1+9+6+9=25.

Wait, 2001 is 2+0+0+1=3.

2002 is 2+0+0+2=4.

2003 is 5, 2004 is 6, 2005 is 7, 2006 is 8. So actually, the minimum digit sum in the range from 1969 to 2006 is 2 (for 2000), but since 2000 is within that range. Wait, but 2000 is included

---------------

 in the possible n's. Wait, but 2000 is a possible n? Let's check. Wait, n must be such that n + S(n) + S(S(n)) = 2007. So if n=2000, then S(n)=2, S(S(n))=2. Then total would be 2000+2+2=2004, which is less than 2007. So 2000 is not a solution, but the digit sum can indeed be as low as 2. However, since

---------------

 n must be at least 1969, but 2000 is above that. Wait, but 

---------------

1970 would have digit sum 1+9+7+0=17. Hmm.

So the possible x (digit sum) can range from, say, 2 up to 28. But given that n is between 1969 and 2006, and

---------------

 n = 2007 - x - S(x), then n must be in that interval. So let's think of x as between, say, let's find the possible x such that 1969 ≤ 2007 - x - S(x) ≤ 2006.

So rearranged, 2007 - x - S(x) ≥ 1969 ⇒ x + S(x) ≤ 2007 - 1969 = 38.

Similarly, 2007 - x - S(x) ≤ 2006 ⇒ x + S(x) ≥ 1.

But the upper bound here is x + S(x) ≤ 38. Since x can be up to 28 (as in 1999's digit sum is 28), then S(x) would be at most S(28)=10. So x + S(x) would be up to 28 + 10 = 38. So the maximum x + S(x) is exactly 38. So that's why the upper bound is 38, so x can be up to 28, but even

---------------

 with x=28, S(x)=10, so x + S(x)=38. So the possible x's are those integers where x + S(x) ≤ 38, and x is between, say, 2 up to 28. But actually, x must be the digit sum of n, which is between 2 and 28 as above, so x ∈ [2,28].

Therefore, x

---------------

 can range from 2 to 28, but with x + S(x) ≤ 38. Let me see, for x from 2 to 28, compute x + S(x) and see which ones are ≤38. But since for x up to 28, the maximum x + S(x) is 28 + 10 = 38, so all x from 2 to 28 are possible except maybe some? Wait, for example, if x=19, then S(x)=10, so x+S(x)=29, which is less than 38. So actually, all x from 2 to 28 satisfy x + S(x) ≤38. Wait, because even for x=28, it's exactly 38. So all x from 2 to 28 are possible candidates. But actually

---------------

, the digit sum x must correspond to some n in the range 1969 to 2006, so maybe

---------------

 not all x are possible. Hmm. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to iterate through possible x from, say, let's see, the minimal possible x such that n =2007 -x - S(x) is at least 1969. Let me think. The minimal x would correspond to the maximal n, which is 2006. Let's see, if n=2006, then x = S(n)=8, so S(S(n))=8. Then n + S(n) + S(S(n)) = 2006 +8 +8=2022, which is more than 2007, so that's not a solution. Wait, so perhaps my initial thought that n can be up to 2006 is wrong? Wait, hold

---------------

 on. Wait, n has to satisfy n + S(n) + S(S(n)) =2007. So if n is 2006, then the total would be 2006 +8 +8=2022 which is too big. Therefore, n can't be that big. So maybe my initial upper bound was wrong? Hmm, so perhaps I need to think again.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 my mistake was in the initial calculation. Let me see. Since n =2007 - S(n) - S(S(n)), so n must be less than 2007, but actually, S

---------------

(n) and S(S(n)) are positive, so n is less than 2007. But when n is large, S(n) is smaller? Wait, for example, 2000 has digit sum 2. So if

---------------

 n is near 2007, like 2000, the digit sum is small, so n + S(n) + S(S(n)) would be 2000 +2 +2=2004, which is under 2007. Wait, so actually, to

---------------

 reach 2007, n has to be such that when you add its digit sum and the digit sum of that, you get up to 2007 -n. So perhaps n is around 2007 minus something like 30? Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider

---------------

 that for n in the range of 1969 to 2006, but when n is higher, S(n) is lower, so the total sum n + S(n) + S(S(n)) would be less? Wait, maybe

---------------

 the maximum value of n + S(n) + S(S(n)) occurs at some point. Let me check with n=1999: 1999 +28 +10=2037. Which is over 2007. Hmm, so that's actually over. So if

---------------

 n is 1999, the total is 2037. So that's too big. Therefore, n must be less than 1999? Wait, but 1999 gives 2037, which is higher than 2007, so to get 2007, n must be less than that?

Wait, let's see. Let's take n=2007 - (S(n) + S(S(n))). Since S(n) + S(S(n)) must be equal to 2007 -n. Since S(n) is at least 1 (for n ≥1), so 2007 -n must be at least 1, so n ≤2006. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can set variables. Let me denote x = S(n), y = S(S(n)). Then the equation is n + x + y =2007. Also, since y = S(x), because y is the sum of the digits of S(n). So we can write y = S(x). So the equation becomes n + x + S(x) =2007. So n =2007 -x -S(x). So given

---------------

 that, n must be a positive integer, and x must be the digit sum of n, and y must be the digit sum of x. 

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding all x such that:

1. x = S(n), where n=2007 -x -S(x)

2. y = S(x), and the

---------------

 equation holds.

Additionally, n must be a positive integer, so 2007 -x -S(x) must be positive, so x + S(x) <2007. Which is certainly true since x ≤28 (as digit sum of n which is less than 2007), so x + S(x) ≤28 +10=38 <2007. So that condition is okay.

Therefore, the key is to find all x in the possible range (probably 1 to 28) such that when you compute n=2007 -x -S(x), then the digit sum of n is x. 

Therefore, the plan is:

- Iterate x from possible minimum to maximum (probably 1 to 28)

- For each x, compute n =2007 -x -S(x)

- Check if the digit sum of n is indeed x

- If yes, then check if S(S(n)) is equal to S(x). Wait, but since y=S(x) and the equation already includes that, perhaps

---------------

 that is automatically satisfied? Wait, let me see. 

Wait, since in the equation n +x + y =2007, and y=S(x). So once n is computed as 2007 -x - y, then if S(n)=x, then it

---------------

's okay. Because then the equation is satisfied. So the key condition is that S(n)=x. Since y is S(x), so once x is fixed, y is determined, so the only condition is that S(n)=x where n=2007 -x - S(x). Therefore, for each x, compute n and check if S(n)=x.

Therefore, the steps are:

1. For x from, say, 1 up to 28:

   a. Compute y = S(x)

   b. Compute n_candidate =2007 -x - y

   c. Compute S(n_candidate). If this equals x, then x is valid, so n_candidate is a solution.

2. Count all such n_candidate where this holds.

So let's try to do this step by step. Let me make a table.

First, let's note that x must be between 1 and 28. Let's start with x=1:

x=1:

y=S(1)=1

n_candidate=2007 -1 -1=2005

Check S(2005): 2+0+0+5=7≠1. Not valid.

n=2007-14-5=1988

S(1988)=1+9+8+8=26≠14. No.

x=15:

y=S(15)=6

n=2007-15-6=1986

x=16:

y=S(16)=7

n=2007-16-7=1984

S(1984)=1+9+8+4=22≠16. Nope.

x=17:

x=18:

y=S(18)=9

n=2007-18-9=1980

S(1980)=1+9+8+0=18. Hey, this works! So x=18 is valid. n=1980 is a solution.

x=19:

y=S(19)=10+1=10 (Wait S(19)=1+9=10)

Wait, so y=10

Wait, n=2007 -19 -10=2007 -29=1978

Compute S(1978)=1+9+7+8=25≠19. Not valid.

x=20:

y=S(20)=2

n=2007-20-2=1985

S(1985)=1+9+8+5=23≠20. Nope.

x=21:

y=S(21)=3

n=2007-21-3=1983

S(1983)=1+9+8+3=21. Wait, that's equal to x=21! So this works. So n=1983 is a solution.

x=22:

y=S(22)=4

n=2007 -22 -4=1981

x=25:

y=S(25)=7

n=2007 -25 -7=1975

S(1975)=1+9+7+5=22≠25. Nope.

x=26:

y=S(26)=8

n=2007-26-8=1973

y=S(28)=10 (since 2+8=10)

n=2007-28-10=1969

S(1969)=1+9+6+9=25≠28. Not valid.

Okay, so from x=1 to x=28, the valid x's where S(n)=x are x=3, 18,21,24. 



---------------

So that gives us four n's: 2001,1980,1983,1977. Wait, let me check each of those again:

For x=3, n=2001: S(2001)=2+0+0+1=3 ✔️

x=18: n=1980: S(1980)=1+9+8+0=18 ✔️

x=21: n=1983: 1+9+8+3=21 ✔️

x=24: n=1977:1+9+7+7=24 ✔️

So four solutions? Wait, but let's check if there are any others. Wait, when I went through each x from 1 to 28, these were the only ones that worked. But let me check if maybe I missed any?

Wait, when x=24, n=1977, which is within the 1969-2006 range. Similarly

---------------

 for the others. 

Wait, but let me check x=25, 26, etc., just to be sure. Wait, I

---------------

 think I covered all. Let me recount the valid x's:

At x=3: yes

x=18: yes

x=21: yes

x=24: yes

So total of 4. Hmm, but let me check if there are any other x's where

---------------

 S(n)=x.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation for some x? Let me double-check some of the edge

---------------

 cases.

x=24:

n=1977: digits 1,9,7,7. Sum is 1+9+7+7=24. Correct.

x=21:

n=1983: 1+9+8+3=21. Correct.

x=18:

1980: 1+9+8+0=18. Correct.

x=3:

2001: 2+0+0+1=3. Correct.

Hmm. So four solutions. But wait, let me check x= 27:



---------------

Wait for x=27, n=1971, S(n)=18. Not 27. Correct.

x=25: n=1975, sum is 22. Not 25. Okay.

Wait, what

---------------

 about x= 12? n=1992, sum is 21. Not 12. So no.

Wait, x

---------------

= 9: n=1989, sum 27. Not 9. So that's not.

Hmm, so four

---------------

 solutions. Wait, but let me see if there are any other x's. Let me check x= 15: n=1986, sum 24. Not 15. No

---------------

.

Wait, x=6: n=1995, sum 24. Not 6.

Hmm. Maybe I missed some?

Wait, let's try x= 12 again. Wait, no. Wait, let

---------------

 me check x= 20:

x=20, n=1985, sum is 1+9+8+5=23. Not 20.

Hmm, so only

---------------

 four? Wait, but let me check x= 10:

n=1996, sum is 1+9+9+6=25. Not 10.

Hmm. Wait, maybe

---------------

 x= 15?

Wait, x=15 gives n=1986, sum is 1+9+8+6=24≠15. So

---------------

 no.

Hmm. Wait, so four solutions. But let me check if there are any other x's between 1 to 28 that I might have miscalculated.

Wait, let's check x= 24 again. 

---------------

2007 -24 -6 (since S(24)=6+2=6? Wait, S(24) is 2+4=6. So yes, y=6. So 2007-24-6=1977. Correct. S

---------------

(1977)=24.

Wait, x= 21: S(21)=3. So 2007-21-3=1983. Correct.

Wait, x= 18: S(18)=9, so 2007-18-9=1980. Correct.

x=3: S(3)=3, so 2007-3-3=2001. Correct.

So,

---------------

 four values. But let me check x= 27 again: S(27)=9, so n=2007-27-9=1971. S(n)=1+9+7+1=18, which is not 27. So no. 

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I missed an x where S(n)=x?

Wait, let me check x= 15 again. Wait, x

---------------

=15, n=1986, sum is 24, which would mean x=24. So that's covered when x=24. 

Hmm. Wait

---------------

, maybe I should check x= 24 again. So n=1977, which gives S(n)=24, so that's correct.

Hmm. So total

---------------

 of four solutions. But let me see if there's a possibility of x= something else.

Wait, let me check x= 12 again. x=12, n=1992, sum is 1+9+9+2=21, so that's x

---------------

=21. So when x=21, n=1983. Wait, but that's different. So perhaps

---------------

 there is a chain here?

Wait, perhaps there is an error in my process. Let me check x= 21:

Wait, when x=21, then n=2007 -21 - S(21). S(21)=3, so 2007-24=1983. Correct. And S(1983)=21. Correct.

Wait, so

---------------

 all steps are correct. So that gives four n's. But wait, let me check another possible x. 

Wait, x= 24, n=1977. Let me confirm S(n)=24. 1+9+7+7=24. Yes. 

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 there are more?

Wait, let me check x= 17 again. x=17, n=1982. S(n)=1+9+8+2=20≠17. 

Hmm. Hmm

---------------

. Wait, perhaps I missed x= 6? Wait, x=6, n=1995, sum is 24. So that would be x

---------------

=24. So that's covered when x=24. 

Wait, perhaps I need to check x=24 again. So

---------------

, yes, that's already counted. 

Wait, maybe I need to check x= 25. 2007-25-7=1975. S(n)=1+9+7+5=22≠25. 

Hmm. Hmm

---------------

. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in calculation for x= 15, but I think I didn't. Let me see:

Wait, let me check x= 18 again. n=1980. 1+9+8+0=18. Correct. 

Wait, maybe

---------------

 I should check if there are other x's beyond 28? Wait, the maximum digit sum for numbers less than 2007 is 28 (for 1999). So x cannot be more than 28, so that

---------------

's covered. 

Wait, perhaps x= 1. Wait, x=1, n=2005, which gives sum 7. Not 1. 

Hmm. 

Wait, perhaps I missed x= 27? But no, that gives n=1971 with sum 18. 

Wait, so four

---------------

 solutions. Hmm. But maybe I made a mistake in the initial steps? Let me check another way. 

Alternatively, perhaps the four numbers are 1977,1980,1983,2001. Let me compute n + S(n) + S(S(n)) for each of these to confirm.

First, 1977:

n=1977, S(n)=24, S(S(n))=S(24)=6. So total:1977+24+6=2007. Correct.

1980: S(n)=18, S(S(n))=9. 1980+18+9=2007. Correct.

1983: S(n)=21, S(S(n))=3. 1983+21+3=2007. Correct.

2001: S(n)=3, S(S(n))=3. 2001+3+3=2007. Correct.

So all four are valid. So that gives four solutions. Hmm, but the problem says "how many values of n". So the answer is 4?

Wait, but let me check if there are any other numbers. Wait, when I was going through x=1 to 28, I found four. But let me check x= 12 again. Wait, n=1992, which had S(n)=21. But 

---------------

21 is another x. So that's already accounted for when x=21. So no problem.

Wait, what

---------------

 about x=22? n=1981, S(n)=1+9+8+1=19. So that's x=19, but when x=19, n=1978, whose digit sum was 25. So no cross-over. 

Hmm. Wait

---------------

, maybe I need to check x= 16? Let me see, x=16 gives n=1984, S(n)=22, which would be x=22. But x=22 gives n=1981, which has sum 19. So there's no cycle here.

Hmm. So

---------------

 perhaps only four solutions. Wait, but let me check another possible x. Let me see x= 7:

x=7 gives n=1993, S(n)=22, which would be x=22. But when x=22, n=1981, which has S(n)=19. So nothing there. 

Hmm, so I think only

---------------

 four. But wait, the problem might have more? Wait, let me think again. Wait, when I considered x from 1 to 28, I found four. But maybe there are some x values where n is a 3-digit number? Wait, but n has to be at least 1969, so n must be 4-digit. Except

---------------

 maybe 1969 itself. Wait, 1969 is a four-digit number. So all n's are four-digit numbers between 1969 and 2006. So the

---------------

 four solutions I found are all four-digit numbers. 

Wait, but let me check n=1998. Just for

---------------

 fun. S(n)=1+9+9+8=27. Then S(S(n))=9. So total would be 1998+27+9=2034. Which is over. 

Wait, another

---------------

 thought: perhaps I missed x= 15? Let me see, x=15, n=1986. S(n)=1+9+8+6=24. So that would correspond to x=24. Which is already counted. So that's okay. 

Wait, so perhaps

---------------

 four is the correct answer. Hmm. But let me think again. 

Wait, another way to approach: Let me see if there are other numbers between 1969 and 2006 where n + S(n) + S(S(n)) =2007. Let me pick n=1998: already checked. 

n=1995: S(n)=24, S(S(n))=6. 1995+24+6=2025. Too big.

n=1992: 1992+21+3=2016. Still over.

n=1989: 1989+27+9=2025. 

n=1986: 1986+24+6=2016. 

n=1983: 1983+21+3=2007. Correct.

n=1980: 1980+18+9=2007. Correct.

n=1977: 1977+24+6=2007. Correct.

n=2001: 2001+3+3=2007. Correct.

Hmm. What about n=1995? Wait, that gives 2025, which is too big.

Wait, n=1990: S(n)=1+9+9+0=19. Then S(S(n))=10. So total is 1990+19+10=2019. Still over.

n=1986: already checked.

Wait, n=1974: Let's see. 1+9+7+4=21. Then S(S(n))=3. So total:1974 +21 +3=1998. Not 2007. 

Hmm. n=1971: 1+9+7+1=18, S(S(n))=9. So total 1971+18+9=1998. Nope.

n=1968: 1+9+6+8=24. S(S(n))=6. Total:1968+24+6=1998. Hmm. 

Hmm. Wait

---------------

, what about n=1995? 1995+24+6=2025. Still over.

Hmm. So

---------------

 it seems like only those four numbers work. Therefore, the answer is 4?

Wait, but I recall that in some problems like this, sometimes there can be more solutions. Let me check another

---------------

 number. Let's see n=1992: sum is 21, so 1992+21+3=2016. Not enough. 

Wait, n=1986: 1986+24+6=2016. Still over.

Wait, n=1983: correct

---------------

. 

Wait, n=1980: correct. 

Wait, n=1977: correct.

n=2001: correct.

Hmm. Maybe

---------------

 I need to check numbers below 1977? For example, n=1974. Let me check n=1974: S(n)=1+9+7+4=21. S(S(n))=3. So total is 1974+21+3=1998. Not enough. 

n=1971: 1971+18+9=1998. Still not. 

Wait, n=1969: S(n)=1+9+6+9=25. S(S(n))=7. So total is 1969+25+7=2001. Not 2007. 

Hmm. 

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 n= 1998? Wait, that was over. 

Wait, n=1995? Over. 

Wait, n=1993: sum 22, so total is 1993+22+4=2019. 

Hmm. 

Wait, so I

---------------

 think only four numbers satisfy the equation. So the answer should be 4. 

Wait, but let me check once more. Let me check n= 1983: 

1983 + 21 + 3 = 2007. Correct. 

1980 +18 +9 =2007. 

1977 +24 +6=2007. 

2001 +3 +3=2007. 

Yes, four numbers. 

Wait, but wait

---------------

 a second, I just thought of something. When I considered x from 1 to 28, I assumed that x can be up to 28. But the

---------------

 digit sum of n can be 28, as in n=1999. Let me check if n=1999 is a solution. 

n=1999: S(n)=28, S(S(n))=10. So total is 1999 +28 +10=2037. Which is way over. 

Hmm. So not a solution. 

Wait, but maybe

---------------

 another number with digit sum 28? Like 1899? Let's see: 1+8+9+9=27. Not 28. 1989: 1+9+8+9=27. 1998:27. 1999:28. So only 1999 has digit sum 28, and that's over.

Okay. So I think four

---------------

 is correct. 

Wait, but let me check x= 24. So n=1977. Is

---------------

 there another x that can lead to another n?

Wait, let me check x=24, n=1977. 

If there's another x where n=2007 -x - S(x) gives S(n)=x. 

Wait, let

---------------

 me think of n=1986. Its digit sum is 24, so x would have to be 24. But n

---------------

=1986 would require x=24, but then n=2007-24 - S(24)=2007-24-6=1977, not 1986. So that's why only 1977 corresponds to x=24. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, perhaps I missed an x where x is higher

---------------

? But no, since x can't be higher than 28. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a three-digit number? Wait, n has to be at least 1969, so three-digit numbers are 100-999, which are too low. 

Hmm. 

Wait, perhaps there is a mistake in my initial assumption that n must be between 1969 and 2006. Let me confirm that. 

The

---------------

 maximum possible S(n) + S(S(n)) is 28+10=38. So n must be at least 2007-38=1969. So yes, that's correct. So n can't be lower than 1969. 

Therefore, the four numbers found are indeed the only solutions. So the answer is 4. 

Wait, but hold

---------------

 on. Let me check x= 15 again. Wait, if x=15, then n=2007-15-6=1986 (since S(15)=6). Then S(n)=1+9+8+6=24. So this would require x=24, but in

---------------

 this case, we started with x=15. So that's why it didn't work. But when x=24, we get n=1977, which does work. 

So the

---------------

 process is correct. 

Therefore, the answer is 4. 

Wait, but in my earlier check, I found four numbers. But let me see, perhaps

---------------

 I missed x= 12? Let me see, when x=12, n=1992. The digit sum of n is 1+9+9+2=21. So that would require x=21, which is another

---------------

 x. So when x=21, we get n=1983, which does work. So that's accounted for. 

So yeah

---------------

, it's four. 

Hmm. I think that's it. So the answer should be 4. 

**Final Answer**
\boxed{4}


To solve the problem, we need to find the number of values of \( n \) such that \( n + S(n) + S(S(n)) = 2007 \), where \( S(n) \) denotes the sum of the digits of \( n \).

1. **Key Observations**:
   - \( n \) must be a positive integer.
   - \( S(n) \) and \( S(S(n)) \) are the sums of the digits of \( n \) and the sum of the digits of \( S(n) \), respectively.
   - The equation can be rearranged to \( n = 2007 - S(n) - S(S(n)) \).
   - \( n \) must be between 1969 and 2006 because the maximum value of \( S(n) + S(S(n)) \) is 38 (achieved when \( n = 1999 \)).

2. **Modulo 9 Analysis**:
   - Since \( 2007 \equiv 0 \mod 9 \), \( n \) must be a multiple of 3.

3. **Iterate Over Possible Values**:
   - We consider \( x = S(n) \) and compute \( n = 2007 - x - S(x) \).
   - Check if \( S(n) = x \).

4. **Checking Each \( x \)**:
   - For \( x \) from 1 to 28 (since the maximum digit sum for \( n \) in the range is 28), we compute \( n \) and check if \( S(n) = x \).

5. **Valid Solutions**:
   - \( x = 3 \): \( n = 2001 \), \( S(2001) = 3 \)
   - \( x = 18 \): \( n = 1980 \), \( S(1980) = 18 \)
   - \( x = 21 \): \( n = 1983 \), \( S(1983) = 21 \)
   - \( x = 24 \): \( n = 1977 \), \( S(1977) = 24 \)

These are the only values of \( n \) that satisfy the equation. Therefore, the number of such values is:
