Okay, so I need to figure out how many values of x satisfy the equation f(f(x)) = 3. The problem gives me the graph of the function f(x), but since I can't see the actual image, I have to rely on the Asymptote code provided to visualize it. Let me parse the Asymptote code step by step to understand the graph's structure.

First, the Asymptote code starts by importing the graph package and setting some parameters for the size and style of the plot. Then, it draws the grid lines for x from -4 to 5 and y from 1 to 6, with dashed grey lines. The x and y axes are labeled, and there are arrows at the ends. 

The main part is the drawing of the function f(x). Let's look at the lines that define the graph:

1. The first segment is drawn from (xmin, (-(0) - (-2)*xmin)/-2) to (-1, (-(0) - (-2)*-1)/-2) with a linewidth of 1.2. Let me simplify that equation. The formula for the line seems to be y = [ -0 - (-2)x ] / -2. Wait, that might be a bit confusing. Let me re-express that.

The general formula for a line can be written as y = mx + b. Let me see if I can parse the Asymptote code's line equation. The first segment is from xmin (which is -4.4) to x = -1. The equation given is (-(0) - (-2)*x)/-2. Let me compute that step by step:

The expression inside the y-coordinate is ( - (0) - (-2)*x ) divided by -2. Simplifying numerator: -0 is 0, so it's 0 + 2x. Then divided by -2 gives (2x)/(-2) = -x. So the equation for this first segment is y = -x. But this is drawn from x = -4.4 up to x = -1. Wait, but the starting point is when x is xmin, which is -4.4, but the line is drawn until x = -1. So the first part of the function from x = -4.4 to x = -1 is the line y = -x.

But let me confirm. The code says:

draw((i,-1)--(i,6), dashed+mediumgrey); for the vertical grid lines, but that's just the grid. The function is drawn with three segments:

First segment: from (xmin, [equation]) to (-1, ...). The equation for the first segment's y-coordinate is (-(0) - (-2)*x)/-2. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me look again. The code says:

draw((xmin, (-(0) - (-2)*xmin)/-2) -- (-1, (-(0) - (-2)*-1)/-2), linewidth(1.2));

Wait, so the y-coordinate at any x in the first segment is calculated as [ -0 - (-2)*x ] divided by -2. Wait, that would be (0 + 2x)/-2 = (2x)/-2 = -x. So yes, the first part is the line y = -x from x = -4.4 to x = -1.

Second segment: draw((-1,1)--(3,5),linewidth(1.2)). So from the point (-1, 1) to (3, 5). Let's see the slope here: from x=-1 to x=3 is 4 units in x, and from y=1 to y=5 is 4 units in y, so slope is 1. So that's a line with slope 1, so equation y = x + b. Plugging in x=-1, y=1: 1 = -1 + b => b=2. So equation here is y = x + 2 from x=-1 to x=3.

Third segment: draw((3, [equation]) -- (xmax, [equation]), linewidth(1.2)). The equation here is written as ( -(-16) - (2)*x ) / 2. Let me parse this. The y-coordinate at x is [ -(-16) - 2x ] divided by 2. That simplifies to (16 - 2x)/2 = 8 - x. Wait, let me check again:

The code says for the third segment: 

draw((3, ( -(-16) - (2)*3 ) / 2 ) -- (xmax, ( -(-16) - (2)*xmax ) / 2 ), linewidth(1.2));

So the y-coordinate is [16 - 2x]/2 = 8 - x. Wait, 

---------------

16 divided by 2 is 8, and -2x/2 is -x, so yes, that's 8 - x. So the third segment is the line y = 8 - x from x=3 to x=5.66 (since xmax is 5.66). 

Additionally, there are some dots mentioned: 

dot((-1,1),ds); dot((3,5),ds); dot((-3,3),ds); dot((1,3),ds); dot((5,3),ds);

These are points that are emphasized on the graph. The points (-1,1), (3,5), (-3,3), (1,3), and (5,3) are plotted as dots. Also, there are two other dots at (-4.32,4.32) and (5.56,2.44), but those might just be endpoints beyond the main graph segments? Wait, but the first segment starts at x=-4.4, so maybe those are just endpoints

---------------

? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, the first segment is from xmin (-4.4) to (-1, ...). The starting point's y-coordinate is -x, so at x=-4.4, that would be y=4.4. But the code also has a dot at (-4.32, 4.32), which is very close to (-4.4, 4.4). Maybe that's just an endpoint. Similarly, the third segment ends at xmax (5.66), so x=5.66, y=8 - 5.66 = 2.34, but the dot is at (5.56, 2.44). Close, perhaps due

---------------

 to rounding. So maybe those dots are just endpoints.

But the other dots: (-3,3), (1,3), (5,3) – these are points on the graph? Wait, let's see. Let me check if those points lie on the lines.

First, (-3,3): Let's see which segment that's in. The first segment is from x=-4.4 to x=-1. So x=-3 is in that interval. The line here is y = -x. So at x=-3, y should be -(-3)=3. So yes, that point is on the first segment. So (-3,3) is on the graph.

Similarly, (1,3): x=1 is between -1 and 3, so in the second segment (y = x + 2). Plugging x=1: y=1 + 2=3. Correct, so (1,3) is on the graph.

(5,3): x=5 is in the third segment (x from 3 to 5.66). The third segment's equation is y=8 - x. So at x=5, y=8 -5 = 3. So yes, (5,3) is on the third segment.

Therefore, those three points (-3,3), (1,3), (5,3) are points on the graph where the function f(x) equals 3. So f(-3)=3, f(1)=3, f(5)=3. The other dots at (-1,1) and (3,5) are the points

---------------

 where the segments connect. 

So putting this all together, the graph of f(x) is a piecewise linear function with three segments:

1. From x = -4.4 to x = -1: f(x) = -x. This is a line going from (-4.4, 4.4) down to (-1,1). 

2. From x = -1 to x = 3: f(x) = x + 2. This line goes from (-1,1) up to (3,5).

3. From x = 3 to x = 5.66: f(x) = 8 - x. This line goes from (3,5) down to (5.66, ~2.34).

Additionally, there are points at (-3,3), (1,3), and (5,3) where f(x)=3. 

Now, the problem is asking for the number of x-values that satisfy f(f(x)) = 3. 

To solve this, I need to find all x such that when you apply f twice, you get 3. That is, first find all x where f(x) = y, and then y must satisfy f(y) = 3. So first, find all y where f(y) = 3, then for each such y, find all x where f(x) = y. The total number of such x's will be the answer.

So first step: find all y such that f(y) = 3. From the graph, we can see that f(y)=3 occurs at three points: y = -3, 1, and 5. Because f(-3)=3, f(1)=3, and f(5)=3 as noted earlier.

Therefore, to have f(f(x)) = 3, we need f(x) to be one of these y-values: -3, 1, or 5. So next, we need to find all x such that f(x) = -3, f(x)=1, or f(x)=5. Then, the total number of such x's is the answer.

Therefore, we need to solve three equations:

1. f(x) = -3

2. f(x) = 1

3. f(x) = 5

For each of these, find the number of solutions x, then add them up.

Let me tackle each case one by one.

First, f(x) = -3.

Looking at the graph of f(x):

The function f(x) is made up of three linear segments. Let's check each segment to see if f(x) = -3 is possible.

First segment: f(x) = -x for x between -4.4 and -1.

Set -x = -3 → x = 3. But x=3 is not in the interval [-4.4, -1]. So no solution here.

Second segment: f(x) = x + 2 for x between -1 and 3.

Set x + 2 = -3 → x = -5. But x=-5 is not in [-1, 3]. No solution here.

Third segment: f(x) = 8 - x for x between 3 and 5.66.

Set 8 - x = -3 → x = 11. But x=11 is outside the interval [3,5.66]. So no solution here.

Therefore, f(x) = -3 has no solutions. So that

---------------

 case contributes 0.

Second equation: f(x) = 1.

Again, check each segment:

First segment: f(x) = -x. Solve -x = 1 → x = -1. Check if x is in [-4.4, -1]. x=-1 is the endpoint. So that's a solution.

Second segment: f(x) = x + 2. Solve x + 2 = 1 → x = -1. But x=-1 is the left endpoint of this segment. However, in the second segment, the domain starts at x=-1. So x=-1 is included here as well. Wait, but in the first segment, the endpoint is at x=-1, so perhaps

---------------

 there's a point at (-1,1). The problem's Asymptote code has a dot at (-1,1), so that point is included in both segments? Wait, actually, in the Asymptote code, the first segment is drawn up to (-1,1), and the second segment starts at (-1,1). So the point (-1,1) is included in both, but since it's a single point, it's part of both segments. So x=-1 is a valid solution here as well. Wait, but when solving f(x)=1, x=-1 is a solution from both segments? Hmm, but since the function is continuous there, it's just one point. So the equation f(x)=1 has x=-1 as a solution.

Third segment: f(x)=8 -x. Solve 8 -x =1 → x=7. But 7 is outside the domain [3,5.66]. So no solution here.

Therefore, f(x)=1 has exactly one solution at x=-1.

Third equation: f(x) =5.

Check each segment:

First segment: f(x) = -x. Set -x =5 → x = -5. Not in [-4.4, -1]. So no.

Second segment: f(x)=x+2. Solve x+2=5 → x=3. Check if x=3 is in [-1,3]. x=3 is the right endpoint. The second segment goes up to x=3, so x=3 is included here, and there's a dot at (3,5). So x=3 is a solution here.

Third segment: f(x)=8 -x. Set 8 -x =5 → x=3. But x=3 is the left endpoint of the third segment. Since the third segment starts at x=3, the

---------------

 point (3,5) is part of both the second and third segments. So x=3 is included here as well. But again, since it's a single point, the equation f(x)=5 has x=3 as the solution. 

Therefore, f(x)=5 has exactly one solution at x=3.

Therefore, putting it all together:

Number of solutions for f(x) = -3: 0

Number of solutions for f(x) =1: 1 (x=-1)

Number of solutions for f(x)=5:1 (x=3)

Therefore, total solutions for f(f(x))=3 is 0 +1 +1 =2?

Wait, hold on, that seems low. Wait, maybe I missed something here. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I need to check for all possible x such that f(x) equals to each of the y-values (which are -3,1,5). But when

---------------

 solving f(x)=1, we found x=-1, and f(x)=5 gives x=3, but perhaps there are more solutions?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in solving f(x)=1 and f(x)=5. Let me re-examine each equation.

Starting with f(x)=1:

First segment: f(x) = -x. Setting that equal to 1 gives x = -1. Since the first segment is from x=-4.4 to x=-1, so x=-1 is the endpoint. So that is valid.

Second segment: f(x)=x+2. Setting to 1 gives x = -1. But the second segment starts at x=-1. So x=-1 is part of the second segment as well. However, since x=-1 is the boundary point between the first and second segments, but the function is continuous there. So in

---------------

 terms of solutions, x=-1 is counted once here. 

Third segment: f(x)=8 -x. Setting to 1 gives x=7, which is outside the domain. So total for f(x)=1 is only x=-1. So that's 1 solution.

For f(x)=5:

First segment: f(x) = -x =5 → x=-5, which is too low.

Second segment: f(x)=x+2=5 → x=3. The second segment goes up to x=3, so that's valid.

Third segment: f(x)=8 -x =5 → x=3. The third segment starts at x=3, so x=3 is part of the third segment as well, but again, it's the same point. So x=3 is the only solution here, counted once. 

Therefore, that

---------------

 gives 1 solution for f(x)=5.

Wait, but maybe there are more points where f(x)=1 or f(x)=5? Let me check the graph's shape again.

Looking at the first segment, from x=-4.4 to x=-1: f(x) = -x. So as x goes from -4.4 to -1, the function goes from 4.4 down to 1. So at x=-1, it's 1, and before that, it's higher. So only x=-1 gives f(x)=1 here.

Second segment from x=-1 to x=3: f(x)=x+2. This goes from 1 up to 5. So at

---------------

 x=3, it's 5. Along the way, it's increasing from 1 to 5, so every value between 1 and 5 is achieved here. Wait, so if we set f(x)=1, the only solution here is x=-1, which is the starting point. Similarly, for f(x)=5, only x=3 here. 

Third segment from x=3 to x=5.66: f(x)=8 -x. This starts at 5 and decreases to 8 -5.66 ≈ 2.34. So in

---------------

 this segment, f(x) goes from 5 down to about 2.34. Therefore, f(x)=5 is achieved only at x=3, and f(x)=1 isn't achieved here because it only goes down to ~2.34, which is above 1. 

Wait a second, but f

---------------

(x)=1 isn't achieved in the third segment because the third segment's minimum y-value is about 2.34. So no

---------------

, only x=-1 is the solution for f(x)=1. Similarly, f(x)=5 is only at x=3. 

Hmm, so that gives 2 solutions total

---------------

? But the problem is asking for how many x satisfy f(f(x))=3. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here because when

---------------

 I considered the equations f(x)= -3, 1, or 5, but maybe there are other points where f(x) can be those values?

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I need to consider that the function f(x) could take the values 1 or 5 at other points?

Wait, let's think again. The function f(x) is piecewise linear, so maybe in the second segment, from x=-1 to 3, the function f(x)=x+2 goes from 1 to 5. So every

---------------

 value between 1 and 5 is achieved here. Therefore, if I set f(x)=1, that occurs only at x=-1. Similarly, f(x)=5 only at x=3. But if I set f(x)= some value between 1 and 5, there are multiple x's, but here we need f(x)= exactly 1 or exactly 5. So only one x each. 

Wait, but maybe

---------------

 I missed something in the first segment?

Wait, in the first segment, f(x) = -x from x=-4.4 to x=-1. So the

---------------

 range here is from 4.4 down to 1. So f(x) here can take any value between 1 and 4.4. So if I set f(x)=3, which is between 1 and 4.4, then that equation would have a solution here. Wait, but in our problem, we are looking for f(x) equal to -3,1, or 5, so 3 isn't in those. Wait, but in

---------------

 the problem, the first step was to find all y where f(y)=3, which are y=-3,1,5. Then, for each of those y's, find the x's such that f(x)=y. So for

---------------

 y=3, which is one of the original f(y)=3, but wait, no. Wait, actually, the process is:

We need f(f(x)) = 3. Let me rephrase:

Let me denote y = f(x). Then f(f(x)) = f(y) = 3. Therefore, first find all y such that f(y)=3. Those y's are the solutions to f(y)=3, which are y = -3, 1, 5 as established. Then, for each of these y's, find all x such that f(x)=y. The total number of x's is the sum over each y of the number of x's that map to y via f(x).

So, for each y in {-3,1,5}, find the number of x with f(x)=y, then add them up.

Earlier, I found that:

For y = -3: f(x) = -3 has 0 solutions.

For y =1: f(x)=1 has 1 solution (x=-1)

For y=5: f(x)=5 has 1 solution (x=3)

Total: 0 +1 +1 =2.

But wait, but

---------------

 that would mean only two solutions. However, maybe I made an error here because in the first segment, f(x) can take the value 3. Wait, but in

---------------

 this case, we are looking for x such that f(x) is equal to -3, 1, or 5. So the

---------------

 3 is only on the first level (the y's that lead to f(y)=3). So 3 is not a target here for f(x). 

Wait, but perhaps there's another way. Wait, let me re

---------------

-express this step by step again.

First step: Find all y such that f(y) = 3. From the graph, this

---------------

 happens at three points: y = -3, 1, and 5. So these are the three y-values that when plugged into f give 3. 

Second step: For each of these y-values, find the number of x such that f(x) = y. 

So for y = -3: How

---------------

 many x with f(x) = -3? 

Looking at f(x):

First segment: f(x) = -x. So solving -x = -3 → x = 3. But x=3 is in the second segment's domain (from -1 to 3). Wait, hold on. Wait, the first segment is up to x=-1, so x=3 is in the second or third segment. Wait, the

---------------

 second segment is up to x=3. So at x=3, f(x)=5. So solving for f(x) = -3 in first segment: x would need to be 3, but that's not in the first segment. The first segment is only up to x=-1. So no solution here. 

Second segment: f(x) =x +2. Setting x+2 = -3 → x = -5. Not in the domain [-1,3]. 

Third segment: f(x)=8 -x. 8 -x = -3 → x=11. Not in [3, 5.66]. 

Thus, no solutions for f(x)=-3.

For y=1: f(x)=1. As before, only x=-1.

For y=5: f(x)=5. Only x=3.

Hence, total solutions are 0+1+1=2.

But that seems low. Let me check again. Wait, perhaps I'm missing solutions where f(x)=1 or f(x)=5 have

---------------

 more solutions?

Wait, let's think again about f(x)=1. The equation f(x)=1 is solved at x=-1, but is

---------------

 there another point? For instance, in the third segment, does f(x) ever equal 1?

The third segment is f(x) =8 -x. So solving 8 -x =1 → x=7, which is outside the domain. So no. 

Wait

---------------

, but the first segment's maximum value is 4.4 (at x=-4.4), going down to 1. So f(x)=1 only at x=-1. 

Similarly for f(x)=5, the second segment reaches 5 at x=3, and the third segment starts at 5 and goes down, so no other x gives f(x)=5. 

Hmm, so that gives two solutions. But the problem is from an Olympiad, maybe the answer is different. Maybe I missed something?

Wait, let me check the Asymptote code again for any other points or segments. The code also has:

// draw((min,(-(-9)-(0)*xmin)/3)--(xmax,(-(-9)-(0)*xmax)/3),linetype("6pt 6pt"));

This line is commented out, so it's not part of the graph. So probably

---------------

 not relevant.

Additionally, the dots at (-3,3), (1,3), (5,3) are on the graph. So f(-3)=3, f(1)=3, f(5)=3. So those are the three y-values that give f(y)=3. 

Wait, but let

---------------

 me think differently. Maybe I made a mistake in the first step. Let me confirm again the values where f(y)=3. The dots at (-3,3), (1,3), (5,3) are on the graph. Therefore, those three points are the only points where f(y)=3. So y=-3,1,5. Correct. 

Therefore, the process is correct. Then, the

---------------

 equations f(x)= -3,1,5 have solutions counts 0,1,1, totaling 2. But maybe I need to check if there are other points where f(x) equals 1 or 5? Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the second segment (from x=-1 to 3) is f(x)=x+2. So for

---------------

 this segment, when x is between -1 and 3, f(x) goes from 1 to 5. So f

---------------

(x)=1 is only at x=-1, and f(x)=5 is only at x=3, which are the endpoints. So that's correct. 

Third segment (x from 3 to 5.66): f(x)=8 -x. So starting

---------------

 at (3,5) and decreasing. So f(x)=5 is only at x=3. 

First segment (x from -4.4 to -1): f(x)=-x, so from

---------------

 4.4 down to 1. So f(x)=1 is only at x=-1. 

Therefore, the count is indeed 2. But that

---------------

 seems too low. Wait, perhaps I need to check if the function f(x) can take the value 1 or 5 at other points?

Wait, let

---------------

 me consider if there are any other intersections. Let me think of the graph:

First segment (left part): from (-4.4, 4.4) down to (-1,1). So slope

---------------

 -1.

Second segment (middle): from (-1,1) up to (3,5). Slope +1.

Third segment (right): from (3,5) down to (5.66, ~2.34). Slope -1.

Therefore, the graph is a zig-zag. 

So the function f(x) is decreasing on the first and third segments, increasing on the second. 

Now, when

---------------

 solving f(x)=1, the only solution is x=-1 because in the first segment, it reaches 1 at x=-1, and in the second segment, it starts at 1 and goes up. So the only point where f(x)=1 is x=-1. 

Similarly, for f(x)=5, only at x=3. 

Therefore, the total number of x's is 2. 

But the problem says "how many values of x satisfy f(f(x)) =3". If

---------------

 the answer is 2, but maybe I made an error in the first step? Wait, let me see the Asymptote code again. It mentions:

label("$f(x)$",(-3.52,4.6),SE*lsf);

And the dots: 

dot((-1,1),ds); dot((3,5),ds); dot((-3,3),ds); dot((1,3),ds); dot((5,3),ds);

So the dots at (-3,3), (1,3), (5,3) are on the graph, so those are three points where f(x)=3. Thus, f

---------------

(y)=3 when y is -3,1,5. 

Wait, but maybe there are other points where f(y)=3? Let me check:

Looking at the first segment: f(x)=-x. So solving

---------------

 f(x)=3 gives -x=3 → x=-3. Which is exactly the point (-3,3). So that's included.

Second segment: f(x)=x+2. Setting x+2=3 gives x=1. Which is the point (1,3). 

Third segment: f(x)=8 -x. Setting 8 -x =3 → x=5, which is (5,3). 

Therefore, those three points are the only ones where f(y)=3. So that's correct. 

Therefore, the only

---------------

 possible y's are -3,1,5, leading to x solutions 0,1,1. 

Hmm. Maybe I need to check if the function f(x) can take the value 1 or 5 at other x's outside

---------------

 the obvious points? Let me see:

For f(x)=1:

First segment: f(x)=-x=1 → x=-1 (which is the endpoint between first and second segments).

Second segment: f(x)=x+2=1 → x=-1 (the start of the second segment).

Third segment: f(x)=8 -x=1 → x=7 (outside domain).

So only x=-1.

For f(x)=5:

Second segment: x+2=5 →x=3 (end of second segment).

Third segment: 8 -x=5 →x=3 (start of third segment).

So only x=3.

Therefore, yes

---------------

, only two solutions. 

Wait, but the problem is from an Olympiad, and the answer seems too small. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the Asymptote code?

Let me re-examine the Asymptote code for the first segment:

The first segment is drawn from (xmin, [equation]) to (-1, ...). The equation given for the first segment is (-(0) - (-2)*x)/-2, which we determined simplifies to -x. 

Wait, let me check that again. The code says:

draw((xmin, (-(0) - (-2)*xmin)/-2) -- (-1, (-(0) - (-2)*-1)/-2), linewidth(1.2));

Breaking down the y-coordinate for the first point (xmin, ...):

The y-coordinate is computed as ( -0 - (-2)*xmin ) divided by -2.

So that's (0 + 2*xmin)/-2 = (2*xmin)/-2 = -xmin. So the y-coordinate is -xmin. 

Wait a second! Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate.

The formula is: 

For the first segment's y-coordinate, the code says:

(-(0) - (-2)*x)/-2

Wait, that's numerator

---------------

: -0 - (-2)x = 0 + 2x, then divided by -2: (2x)/(-2) = -x. So that is correct. So the first segment is indeed y = -x. 

But then, when x is xmin, which is -4.4, then y would be -(-4.4)=4.4. So the starting point is (-4.4,4.4), which is consistent with the dot at (-4.32,4.32) (probably rounded). 

Therefore, my previous analysis holds. 

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the function might be defined at points beyond the drawn segments? But the problem says "the graph of the function f(x) is shown below", so we can assume the graph is exactly as drawn, with the three segments. 

Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the number of solutions for f(x)=1 or f(x)=5?

Wait, let me think of the entire graph again. 

Suppose someone draws the graph:

- From the left, starting at (-4.4,4.4), going down to (-1,1).

- Then up to (3,5).

- Then down again to (5.66, ~2.34).

The three key points where f(x)=3 are at x=-3 (on first segment), x=1 (on second), and x=5 (on third). 

So f

---------------

(f(x))=3 requires that f(x) must be one of those three x-values (-3,1,5). 

Thus, to find x such that f(x) is -3,1, or5. 

For

---------------

 f(x)=-3: no solutions.

For f(x)=1: x=-1.

For f(x)=5: x=3.

So total x's are -1 and 3, so two solutions. 

Wait, but the problem says "how many values of x satisfy...", so the answer is 2? 

Alternatively, maybe there are more solutions because when solving f(x)=1 or f(x)=5, there are more x's?

Wait, let me consider the entire

---------------

 graph again for f(x)=1 and f(x)=5:

For f(x)=1:

The function reaches 1 only at x=-1. Since the first segment is decreasing from 4.4 to 1, and the second segment starts at 1 and goes up. So yes, only x=-1.

For f(x)=5:

The function reaches 5 only at x=3. The second segment ends at 5, and the third segment starts there and goes down. So only x=3. 

Hence, only two x's. 

Wait, but maybe the function

---------------

 has other intersections? For instance, in the third segment, when x=5, f(x)=3. So if we consider

---------------

 f(f(5)) = f(3) =5. But that would be f(f(5))=5, which is not 3, so that's irrelevant. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to check if f(x)= y where y is such that f(y)=3, but considering

---------------

 multiplicities? Wait, no. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is defined at the endpoints correctly. For example, at x=-1, the first segment ends and the second starts. So f(-1)=1 is part of both segments, but it's a single point, so no extra solutions there. 

Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the number of solutions for f(x)=1 or f(x)=5?

Wait, let's take a different approach. Let me tabulate the possible ranges and see for each y in {-3,1,5}, how many x satisfy f(x)=y.

Starting with y=-3:

Looking at f(x)= -3.

Looking at each segment:

1. First segment (x from -4.4 to -1): f(x) = -x. Set to -3:

-x = -3 → x=3. But 3 is not in [-4.4, -1]. So no solution.

2. Second segment (x from -1 to 3): f(x)=x +2. Set to -3:

x +2 = -3 → x = -5. Not in [-1,3]. No.

3. Third segment (x from 3 to 5.66): f(x)=8 -x. Set to -3:

8 -x =-3 → x=11. Not in domain. No. So total 0.

y=1:

1. First segment: -x =1 → x=-1. In domain. So 1 solution.

2. Second segment: x+2=1 → x=-1. In domain (since x=-1 is the start). So same point. So total 1 solution.

3. Third segment:8 -x=1 →x=7. No. 

Total 1 solution.

y=5:

1. First segment: -x=5 →x=-5. No.

2. Second segment: x+2=5 →x=3. In domain (up to 3). So yes.

3. Third segment:8 -x=5 →x=3. In domain (starting at 3). Same point. So total 1 solution.

Total solutions:0+1+1=2.

Hmm. So that

---------------

's consistent. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem counts the point x=3 as two solutions because it's the endpoint of two segments? But no, even

---------------

 though it's part of two segments, the function's value there is uniquely 5, so f(3)=5 is only one x=3. 

Same with x=-1: it's part of both segments, but f(-1)=1 is only one x=-1.

Therefore, total two solutions. 

Wait, but maybe the Asymptote code has another part I didn't consider. The commented-out line:

// draw((min,(-(-9)-(0)*xmin)/3)--(xmax,(-(-9)-(0)*xmax)/3),linetype("6pt 6pt"));

This line is commented out, so it's not part of the graph. So I can ignore it.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the slope

---------------

 for the third segment? Let me check:

The third segment is drawn from (3, [equation]) to (xmax, [equation]). The equation given is ( -(-16) -2*x ) / 2. 

Wait, let me parse that again. The y-coordinate at any x in the third segment is:

[ -(-16) - (2)*x ] / 2. 

Wait, -(-16) is 16, so (16 - 2x)/2 = 8 -x. Yes, that's correct. So the third segment is y=8 -x. So that's correct. 

Hmm, so unless

---------------

 there's an error in my reasoning, the answer should be 2. But I feel like maybe I'm missing something because often these problems have more solutions. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the first segment goes from x=-4.4 to x=-1, so in

---------------

 that segment, f(x) = -x. So for any x between -4.4 and -1, f(x) is between 1 and 4.4. 

Therefore

---------------

, the equation f(x)=3 has solutions in this segment. Wait a second! Wait, hold on. Wait, if

---------------

 f(y)=3, then y can be -3,1,5. But to get f(f(x))=3, we need f(x) to be one of those y's. However, when I considered f(x)= -3,1,5, I found only two solutions. But what about if f(x) is equal

---------------

 to other values that might lead to f(y)=3 through another path?

Wait no. Wait, no. The logic is correct. To have f(f(x))=3, f(x) must be a value y where f(y)=3. Since f(y)=3 only when y is -3,1,5, then f(x) must be one of those three. So f

---------------

(x) must equal to -3,1, or5. 

Therefore, only those three possibilities. Hence, only two solutions. 

Alternatively, maybe there are other y-values where f(y)=3? For example, maybe

---------------

 at x= something else?

Wait, let me see. The three points where f(y)=3 are at x=-3,1,5. Are

---------------

 there any other points on the graph where the y-coordinate is 3?

Looking at the first segment: from x=-4.4 to x=-1, f(x) is -x. So setting

---------------

 f(x)=3 → x=-3. Which is indeed in that segment (since -4.4 < -3 < -1). So that's the point (-3,3). 

Second segment: from x=-1 to 3, f(x)=x+2. Setting f(x)=3 gives x+2=3 →x=1. Which is in the domain. 

Third segment: from x=3 to 5.66, f(x)=8 -x. Setting to 3 gives 8 -x=3 →x=5. Which is in the domain. 

Therefore, those three points are the only ones where f(y)=3. So that's correct. 

Therefore, the only possible y's are -3,1,5. 

Thus, the equations

---------------

 f(x)=y for those y's give 0,1,1 solutions. So total 2. 

Hmm. Maybe the answer is 2. But let me check once more for f(x)=1 and f(x)=5. 

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 when solving f(x)=1, even though x=-1 is the only solution, but maybe in another segment?

Wait, in the first segment, f(x)= -x. So when

---------------

 x=-1, f(x)=1, which is the end of the first segment. The second segment starts at x=-1 with f(x)=1. So x

---------------

=-1 is included in both, but it's just one point. 

Similarly, x=3 is the end of the second segment and the start of the third, so only

---------------

 one point. 

Alternatively, maybe there are other x's where f(x)=1 or 5?

Wait, let me think of the entire graph:

The function f(x) is piecewise linear with three segments. Let me list

---------------

 the equations and their domains again:

1. For x ∈ [-4.4, -1]: f(x) = -x. This is a line from (-4.4,4.4) to (-1,1). 

2. For x ∈ [-1, 3]: f(x) =x+2. This is a line from (-1,1) to (3,5). 

3. For x ∈ [3,5.66]: f(x) =8 -x. This is a line from (3,5) to (5.66, ~2.34). 

So, for f(x)=1:

In segment 1, solving -x=1 gives x=-1, which is in the domain. 

In segment 2, solving x+2=1 gives x=-1, which is the start of the segment, so included. 

In segment 3, solving 8 -x=1 gives x=7, which is outside. 

Thus, only x=-1. 

Similarly, for f(x)=5:

Segment 1: -x=5 →x=-5 not in domain.

Segment 2: x+2=5 →x=3, which is the end of the segment. 

Segment 3:8 -x=5 →x=3, the start of the segment. 

Thus, only x=3. 

Therefore, two

---------------

 solutions. 

Hmm. Maybe the answer is indeed 2. 

Alternatively, perhaps I missed the points where f(x) equals to the

---------------

 y-values at the other 3 points?

Wait, the problem mentions dots at (-3,3), (1,3), (5,3). So maybe those are the only points where f(x)=3, so f

---------------

(f(x))=3 requires f(x) to be one of those x-values (-3,1,5). 

Thus, the x's that map to -3,1,5 via f(x). 

Therefore

---------------

, f(x)=-3: 0

f(x)=1:1 (x=-1)

f(x)=5:1 (x=3)

Total 2. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem counts x=-3,1,5 as possible x's? Wait, no. Because f(f(x))=3 requires f(x) to be in {-3,1,5}, but the x's we are counting are the pre-images of those y's. 

Wait, but

---------------

 maybe x=-3 is a solution? Let me check:

If x=-3, then f(-3)=3. Then f(f(-3))=f(3)=5. So f(f(-3))=5≠3. So x=-3 is not a solution. 

Similarly, x=1: f(1)=3, so f(f(1))=f(3)=5≠3. Not a solution. 

x=5: f(5)=3, so f(f(5))=f(3)=5≠3. Not a solution. 

Therefore, those x's where f(x)=3 do not satisfy f(f(x))=3. 

Therefore

---------------

, only the x's that map to -3,1,5 are the ones to consider, which are 0,1,1. 

Therefore, the answer must be 2. 

Hmm, maybe the answer is 2, but perhaps I made a mistake in the Asymptote code parsing? Let me check once more the Asymptote code for any other segments

---------------

 or points. 

Looking back at the Asymptote code:

The first segment is drawn from xmin to -1, the second from -1 to3, third from3 to xmax. The dots at (-3,3), (1,3), (5,3) are on the graph. 

No

---------------

 other segments are mentioned. The commented line is for a horizontal line at y= -3? Let me see:

The commented line was:

// draw((min,(-(-9)-(0)*xmin)/3)--(xmax,(-(-9)-(0)*xmax)/3),linetype("6pt 6pt"));

This

---------------

 seems like it would draw a horizontal line at y=3, since the equation simplifies to y= [9 -0]/3 = 3. But it's commented out, so it's not part of the graph. So the horizontal line at y=3 is not part of the function. The three dots at (-3,3), (1,3), (5,3) are on the graph, but the line y=3 isn't. 

Therefore, the only points where f(x)=3 are those three dots. 

Therefore, my conclusion is that there are 2 solutions. 

Wait, but let

---------------

 me consider if f(x) can be 1 or5 at more points. For example, in the first segment, is

---------------

 there another x where f(x)=1? 

Wait, f(x) in first segment is -x. So f(x)=1 only when x=-1, which is the endpoint. 

In the second segment, f(x)=x+2=1 only

---------------

 at x=-1. 

Similarly, f(x)=5 only at x=3. 

Thus, I think the answer is indeed 2. 

However, since

---------------

 this is an Olympiad problem, maybe there is a trick here. Let me think differently. 

Suppose someone interprets the graph as including open or closed endpoints differently. For example, if the first segment is up to but not including x=-1, then x=-1 would belong only to the second segment. But in the Asymptote code, the first segment is drawn to (-1, ...), so it includes x=-1. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is discontinuous at x=-1 or x=3, but the dots are there, and the lines connect, so it's continuous. 

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the inverse functions?

Let me try to sketch the graph mentally:

From left to right:

- Starting at x=-4.4, y=4.4, going down to (-1,1). So this is a line with slope -1.

Then, from (-1,1), going up to (3,5), slope +1.

Then, from (3,5) going down to (5.66, ~2.34), slope -1.

Thus, the graph has three linear pieces. 

Now, the equation f(f(x))=3 requires f(x) to be in {-3,1,5}. 

Now

---------------

, the question is, how many x satisfy f(x) = -3,1, or5. 

We already saw that f(x) =-3 has no solution.

f(x)=1 has one solution at x=-1.

f(x)=5 has one solution at x=3.

Thus, total 2. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem counts the points where f(x) equals to those values in

---------------

 different segments as separate solutions?

Wait, for example, when solving f(x)=1, even though it's the same point x=-1, but maybe

---------------

 it's counted twice because it's in two segments? But no, it's a single point. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem's

---------------

 graph is different? For example, maybe the third segment is different?

Wait, in the Asymptote code, the third segment is drawn from (3, [equation]) to (xmax, ...). The equation for the third segment is ( -(-16) - 2x ) / 2 = (16 -2x)/2=8 -x. So yes, slope -1, starting at (3,5). 

Alternatively, maybe the third segment is a

---------------

 different line? Let me see:

The code says:

draw((3,(-(-16)-(2)*3)/2)--(xmax,(-(-16)-(2)*xmax)/2),linewidth(1.2));

So for the starting point at x=3:

y = (16 - 2*3)/2 = (16-6)/2=10/2=5. So that's correct. 

Thus, the third segment is correct. 

Hmm, I think I have to go with 2 as the answer. Maybe the problem is designed to have two solutions. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the first step,

---------------

 thinking that f(y)=3 has three solutions, but perhaps there are more? 

Wait, let me recheck f(y)=3.

First segment: f(x)=-x=3 ⇒x=-3. Which

---------------

 is between -4.4 and -1. So yes.

Second segment: f(x)=x+2=3 ⇒x=1. Between -1 and 3. Yes.

Third segment: f(x)=8 -x=3 ⇒x=5. Between 3 and 5.66. Yes. 

So three solutions for f(y)=3. 

Then, for each of those y's (which are -3,1,5), find x such that f(x)=y. 

So for y=-3: 0 solutions.

For y=1: x=-1.

For y=5: x=3.

Total of 2. 

Therefore, I think the answer is 2. 

Wait, but maybe I made

---------------

 a mistake in the problem's initial interpretation. The Asymptote code draws some dots at (-4.32,4.32) and (5.56,2.44). These are likely the endpoints of the first and third segments, so they don't add any new solutions. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a horizontal

---------------

 line at y=3 which is part of the graph, but it's commented out. The commented line:

// draw((min,(-(-9)-(0)*xmin)/3)--(xmax,(-(-9)-(0)*xmax)/3),linetype("6pt 6pt"));

This line, if not commented, would draw a horizontal line at y=3 from x=min to x=xmax. Because the y-coordinate is computed as [ -(-9) -0*x ]/3 = 9/3=3. So that would be a horizontal line at y=3 across the entire domain. But it's commented out, so not part of the graph. 

Therefore, the only points where f(x)=3 are the three dots. 

Thus, I think the answer is 2. 

Wait, but let

---------------

 me think once more of the entire process. Maybe I can visualize the function and the composition.

Suppose I want f(f(x)) =3. That means first applying f to x, getting some value y, then applying f again to y to get 3. So y must be such that f(y)=3, so y is -3,1,5. 

Thus, the

---------------

 x's are those that map to -3,1, or5 via f(x). 

The count for each:

- For y=-3: no x's.

- For y=1: x must be -1.

- For y=5: x must be 3.

Thus, total 2 x's: x=-1 and x=3. 

Therefore, the answer is 2. 

Hmm

---------------

, maybe the answer is 2. I think that's correct. 

**Final Answer**
Answer: 2


To determine how many values of \( x \) satisfy \( f(f(x)) = 3 \), we need to analyze the given piecewise function \( f(x) \) and its graph. The function \( f(x) \) is defined as follows:

1. For \( x \in [-4.4, -1] \): \( f(x) = -x \)
2. For \( x \in [-1, 3] \): \( f(x) = x + 2 \)
3. For \( x \in [3, 5.66] \): \( f(x) = 8 - x \)

Key points on the graph where \( f(x) = 3 \) are at \( x = -3 \), \( x = 1 \), and \( x = 5 \). Therefore, the values of \( y \) such that \( f(y) = 3 \) are \( y = -3 \), \( y = 1 \), and \( y = 5 \).

Next, we need to find the number of solutions \( x \) such that \( f(x) = -3 \), \( f(x) = 1 \), or \( f(x) = 5 \):

1. **For \( f(x) = -3 \)**:
   - No

---------------

 solutions exist because solving \( -x = -3 \), \( x + 2 = -3 \), or \( 8 - x = -3 \) results in \( x = 3 \), \( x = -5 \), or \( x = 11 \), none of which are within the respective domains.

2. **For \( f(x) = 1 \)**:
   - The solution is \( x = -1 \) (endpoint of both the first and second segments).

3. **For \( f(x) = 5 \)**:
   - The solution is \( x = 3 \) (endpoint of both the second and third segments).

Summarizing the results:
- \( f(x) = -3 \) has 0 solutions.
- \( f(x) = 1 \) has 1 solution (\( x = -1 \)).
- \( f(x) = 5 \) has 1 solution (\( x = 3 \)).

Thus, the total number of values of \( x \) that satisfy \( f(f(x)) = 3 \) is \( 0 + 1 + 1 = 2 \).

\[
\boxed{2}
