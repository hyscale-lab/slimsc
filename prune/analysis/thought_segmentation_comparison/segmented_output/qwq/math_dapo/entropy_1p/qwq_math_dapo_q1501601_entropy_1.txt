Okay, so I have this problem about a rectangular prism, ABCD-A₁B₁C₁D₁. The given lengths are AB = AA₁ = 2, and AD = 2√3. There's a point M in the plane BA₁C₁, and I need to find the minimum value of the dot product of vectors MA and MC. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are integers, and then I need to find m + n. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I should probably sketch the rectangular prism to get a better visual. Let me recall the standard labeling: the base is ABCD, and the top face is A₁B₁C₁D₁, with edges like AA₁, BB₁, etc. So AB is the edge from A to B, which is given as 2 units. Similarly, AA₁ is also 2 units, so the height of the prism is 2. The length AD is 2√3, which is the edge from A to D on the base. Since it's a rectangular prism, all angles are right angles.

Now, point M is in the plane BA₁C₁. Let me figure out what that plane looks like. The plane BA₁C₁ connects points B, A₁, and C₁. Let me note the coordinates of these points. Maybe setting up a coordinate system would help here. Let me assign coordinates to the vertices. Let's place point A at the origin (0,0,0). Then, since AB is 2, and AB is along the x-axis, point B would be (2,0,0). AD is 2√3 along the y-axis, so point D would be (0, 2√3, 0). Since AA₁ is 2 along the z-axis, point A₁ is (0,0,2). 

Now, let me find coordinates for the other points. Point C is diagonally opposite to A on the base, so since AB is along x and AD along y, then C would be (2, 2√3, 0). Similarly, point C₁ is directly above C, so its coordinates are (2, 2√3, 2). Point B₁ is (2,0,2).

So the plane BA₁C₁ includes points B(2,0,0), A₁(0,0,2), and C₁(2, 2√3, 2). I need to find the equation of this plane first so that I can describe point M's coordinates in terms of parameters, then compute the vectors MA and MC and their dot product, and find its minimum.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way using vectors and coordinates. Let me try to set up coordinates for point M. Since M is in the plane BA₁C₁, perhaps I can parametrize the coordinates of M using parameters and then express the vectors MA and MC in terms of those parameters, then compute their dot product and find the minimum.

First, let's find the equation of the plane BA₁C₁. To do that, I can use the three points B(2,0,0), A₁(0,0,2), and C₁(2, 2√3, 2). Let me find two vectors in the plane, say BA₁ and BC₁.

Vector BA₁ is A₁ - B = (0-2, 0-0, 2-0) = (-2, 0, 2).

Vector BC₁ is C₁ - B = (2-2, 2√3 - 0, 2 - 0) = (0, 2√3, 2).

Then the normal vector to the plane can be found by taking the cross product of BA₁ and BC₁.

Let me compute BA₁ × BC₁:

|i     j         k|
|-2    0        2|
|0   2√3     2|

Calculating determinant:

i*(0*2 - 2*2√3) - j*(-2*2 - 2*0) + k*(-2*2√3 - 0*0)

Simplify each component:

i*(0 - 4√3) - j*(-4 - 0) + k*(-4√3 - 0)

So that's:

-4√3 i + 4 j -4√3 k

Therefore, the normal vector is (-4√3, 4, -4√3). To make it simpler, we can divide by 4 to get (-√3, 1, -√3). 

The equation of the plane can be written as:

-√3(x - x0) + 1(y - y0) - √3(z - z0) = 0

We can use point B(2,0,0) to plug in:

-√3(x - 2) + 1(y - 0) - √3(z - 0) = 0

Expanding:

-√3 x + 2√3 + y - √3 z = 0

So the plane equation is:

-√3 x + y - √3 z + 2√3 = 0

Alternatively, rearranged:

√3 x - y + √3 z = 2√3

Hmm, perhaps better to write in standard form. Anyway, maybe

---------------

 it's better to parametrize point M in this plane.

Alternatively, since we need to find the minimum of MA · MC, perhaps using coordinates would be straightforward.

Let me denote coordinates of M as (x, y, z). Since M is in the plane BA₁C₁, it must satisfy the plane equation. Let me write the plane equation again:

-√3 x + y - √3 z + 2√3 = 0

So, equation (1): y = √3 x + √3 z - 2√3

Alternatively, rearr

---------------

anged as y = √3 (x + z) - 2√3.

Alternatively, perhaps parametrizing the plane with two parameters. Let me choose parameters such

---------------

 that we can express coordinates of M in terms of two variables. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of vectors. Let me think of vectors BA₁ and BC₁ as direction vectors in the plane. Since BA₁ is (-2, 0, 2) and BC₁ is (0, 2√3, 2). So any point M in the plane can be expressed as B + s*(BA₁) + t*(BC₁), where s and t are real numbers. Let me check.

So point B is (2,0,0). Then, M = (2,0,0) + s*(-2,0,2) + t*(0, 2√3, 2). 

Therefore, coordinates of M are:

x = 2 - 2s + 0*t = 2 - 2s,

y = 0 + 0*s + 2√3 t = 2√3 t,

z = 0 + 2s + 2t.

So parametrizing M as:

x = 2 - 2s,

y = 2√3 t,

z = 2s + 2t.

So s

---------------

 and t can be any real numbers. So this parametrization covers the entire plane BA₁C₁.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use parameters u and v, but anyway, s and t are fine. So now, with coordinates of M expressed in terms of s and t, we can write vectors MA and MC.

First, let's write coordinates of A and C.

Point A is (0,0,0).

Point C is (2, 2√3, 0).

So vector MA = A - M = (0 - x, 0 - y, 0 - z) = (-x, -y, -z).

Vector MC = C - M = (2 - x, 2√3 - y, 0 - z).

So the dot product MA · MC is:

(-x)(2 - x) + (-y)(2√3 - y) + (-z)(0 - z).

Let me compute each term:

First term: -x*(2 - x) = -2x + x²,

Second term: -y*(2√3 - y) = -2√3 y + y²,

Third term: -z*(-z) = z².

So altogether, the dot product is:

x² - 2x + y² - 2√3 y + z² + z²? Wait, wait, hold on. Wait the third term is (-z)*( - z) ?

Wait, no. Wait, MC is (2 - x, 2√3 - y, 0 - z). So the z-component is (0 - z). So when we take the dot product of MA and MC, the z-component is (-z) * (0 - z) = (-z)(-z) = z². So that's correct. So altogether, the dot product is:

(x² - 2x) + (y² - 2√3 y) + (z²) + z²? Wait, no, wait

---------------

:

Wait the third term is (-z)*( - z) = z², so total terms:

x² - 2x + y² - 2√3 y + z².

Wait, yes

---------------

, that's correct. So the total is:

x² + y² + z² - 2x - 2√3 y.

Hmm, okay. So the dot product MA · MC simplifies to x² + y² + z² - 2x - 2√3 y.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write this expression in terms of coordinates of M, then substitute the parametrization from the plane.

Alternatively, since we have parametrized M in terms of s and t, we can substitute x, y, z in terms of s and t, then write the expression in terms of s and t, then find its minimum.

Let me proceed with that.

So from earlier:

x = 2 - 2s,

y = 2√3 t,

z = 2s + 2t.

Therefore:

x² = (2 - 2s)^2 = 4 - 8s + 4s²,

y² = (2√3 t)^2 = 12 t²,

z² = (2s + 2t)^2 = 4s² + 8st + 4t²,

Then, substituting into the expression:

x² + y² + z² - 2x - 2√3 y.

Let me compute each term step by step:

First term: x² = 4 - 8s + 4s²,

Second term: y² = 12 t²,

Third term: z² = 4s² + 8st + 4t²,

Fourth term: -2x = -2*(2 - 2s) = -4 + 4s,

Fifth term: -2√3 y = -2√3*(2√3 t) = -2√3*2√3 t = -12 t,

So putting all together:

(4 - 8s + 4s²) + (12 t²) + (4s² + 8st + 4t²) + (-4 + 4s) + (-12 t).

Now combine like terms:

First, the constants: 4 - 4 = 0.

Terms with s:

-8s + 4s = -4s,

Terms with t:

-12 t,

Terms with s²:

4s² + 4s² = 8s²,

Terms with t²:

12t² + 4t² = 16 t²,

Cross terms with st:

8st,

So altogether:

8s² + 16 t² + 8st -4s -12t.

So the expression to minimize is 8s² + 16 t² + 8st -4s -12t.

Hmm, that's a quadratic in variables s and t. To find its minimum, perhaps we can complete the square or use calculus. Let me try using calculus here, taking partial derivatives with respect to s and t, setting them to zero.

Let me denote the function as f(s,t) = 8s² + 16t² +8st -4s -12t.

Compute partial derivatives:

df/ds = 16s +8t -4,

df/dt = 32t +8s -12.

Set both partial derivatives to zero:

1) 16s +8t -4 =0,

2) 8s +32t -12 =0.

Wait, hold on, let me check:

Wait the derivative of 8s² is 16s, 8st with respect to s is 8t, and the rest terms: -4 and

---------------

 -12t don't involve s, so derivative of those with respect to s is 0 and -12t's derivative with respect to s is 0. Wait, no, the -12t term is -12t, so its derivative with respect to s is 0. Wait, so the first derivative is 16s +8t -4, yes.

Second derivative:

df/dt is 32t (from 16t² *

---------------

2?), wait wait, let me recompute.

Wait f(s,t) = 8s² +16t² +8st -4s -12t.

The

---------------

 derivative with respect to t:

d/dt [8s²] =0,

d/dt [16t²] = 32t,

d/dt [8st] =8s,

d/dt [-4s] =0,

d/dt [-12t] = -12.

Therefore, df/dt = 32t +8s -12.

So equations:

1) 16s +8t =4,

2) 8s +32t =12.

Let me write them as:

Equation 1: 16s + 8t =4,

Equation 2: 8s +32t =12.

Let me simplify these equations by dividing by common factors.

Equation 1: divide by 4: 4s + 2t =1,

Equation 2: divide by 4: 2s +8t =3.

So now:

Equation 1: 4s + 2t =1,

Equation 2: 2s +8t =3.

Let me solve this system. Let's use elimination. Let me multiply Equation 1 by 2 to get:

Equation1 *2: 8s +4t =2,

Equation2: 2s +8t =3.

Now subtract equation 2 multiplied by 4 from equation 1*2?

Wait, maybe better to multiply

---------------

 equation2 by 2 and subtract equation1*2?

Alternatively, let me write equations:

Equation1: 4s +2t =1,

Equation2: 2s +8t =3.

Let me solve for one variable. Let's solve equation1 for 4s =1 -2t, so s=(1 -2t)/4.

Substitute into equation2:

2*( (1 -2t)/4 ) +8t =3,

Simplify:

( (2)(1 -2t) ) /4 +8t =3,

( (1 -2t)/2 ) +8t =3,

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate denominator:

(1 -2t) +16t =6,

Combine like terms:

1 +14t =6,

14t=5,

t=5/14.

Then plug back into s=(1 -2t)/4,

s=(1 -2*(5/14))/4 = (1 - 5/7)/4 = (2/7)/4 = (2)/(28) = 1/14.

So s=1/14 and t=5/14.

Therefore, the critical point is at s=1/14 and t=5/14.

Now, we need to check if this is indeed a minimum. Since the function is a quadratic form and the coefficients of s² and t² are positive (8 and 16), the quadratic form is convex, so this critical point should be a minimum.

Now, compute the value of f(s,t) at s=1/14, t=5/14.

First, let me compute each term:

8s² =8*(1/14)^2 =8*(1/196)= 8/196 = 2/49,

16t²=16*(25/196)=400/196=100/49,

8st=8*(1/14)*(5/14)=40/(196)=10/49,

-4s= -4*(1/14)= -2/7,

-12t= -12*(5/14)= -60/14= -30/7.

Adding all terms:

First, the terms with denominator 49:

2/49 +100/49 +10/49 = (2+100+10)/49=112/49=16/7,

Then the terms with denominator 7:

-2/7 -30/7 = (-32)/7,

So total f(s,t)=16/7 -32/7 = (-16)/7.

Wait, that's -16/7? Hmm, but let me check the calculation again step by step to be sure.

Wait let me compute each term again:

First term: 8s² =8*(1/14)^2 =8*(1/196)=8/196=2/49 ≈0.0408,

Second term:16t²=16*(5/14)^2=16*(25/196)=400/196=100/49≈2.0408,

Third term:8st=8*(1/14)*(5/14)=8*(5)/196=40/196=10/49≈0.2041,

Fourth term: -4s= -4*(1/14)= -4/14= -2/7≈-0.2857,

Fifth term: -12t= -12*(5/14)= -60/14= -30/7≈-4.2857,

Now adding them all numerically:

First three terms: 2/49 +100/49 +10/49 =112/49 ≈2.2857,

Then the last two terms: -2/7 -30/7 = -32/7≈-4.5714,

So total is 2.2857 -4.5714≈-2.2857,

Which is -16/7≈-2.2857.

Hmm, so the minimal value is -16/7. Wait, but the problem asks for the minimal value of the dot product MA · MC. So is this the answer? Let me confirm.

Wait, but let

---------------

 me check the calculation again to be precise.

Wait 8s²: s is 1/14, so squared is 1/196, times 8 is 8/196 = 2/49,

16t²: t is 5/14, squared is 25/196, times 16 is 400/196 = 100/49,

8st: 8*(1/14)*(5/14) = 40/196 =10/49,

Then the

---------------

 rest terms:

-4s = -4*(1/14) = -2/7,

-12t= -12*(5/14)= -60/14 = -30/7,

Now adding all terms:

2/49 +100/49 +10/49 = (2+100+10)/49 = 112/49 = 16/7,

Then -2/7 -30/7 = (-32)/7,

So total is 16/7 -32/7 = (-16)/7. So yes, that's correct.

So the minimal value is -16/7. Wait

---------------

, but the problem says "the minimal value of the dot product". Since the dot product can be negative, so -16/7 is the minimal value. However, let me make sure that this is indeed the minimal value and that there are no calculation errors.

Alternatively, perhaps there is an error in the parametrization?

Wait, let me confirm the parametrization again.

We set M = B + s*BA₁ + t*BC₁,

Where BA₁ is vector from B to A₁: (-2,0,2),

and BC₁ is vector from B to C₁: (0,2√3,2).

Therefore, the parametrization is correct:

x = 2 - 2s +0*t,

y =0 +0*s +2√3 t,

z=0 +2s +2t,

Yes, that's correct.

Then substituting into the expression for MA · MC, which is x² + y² + z² -2x -2√3 y.

Wait, let me check the expression again. Wait when I computed MA · MC earlier, I had:

MA · MC = (-x)(2 -x) + (-y)(2√3 - y) + (-z)(-z),

Wait, let

---------------

's redo that step again to confirm:

MA = ( -x, -y, -z )

MC = (2 -x, 2√3 - y, -z )

Wait, no, wait point

---------------

 C is (2, 2√3, 0), so MC is (2 - x, 2√3 - y, 0 - z). So the third component is -z.

Therefore, the dot product is:

(-x)(2 -x) + (-y)(2√3 - y) + (-z)(-z) =

-2x +x² -2√3 y + y² + z²,

Yes, so that's correct: x² + y² + z² -2x -2√3 y.

Therefore, the substitution into the parametrization is correct.

Therefore, the calculation leading to -16/7 is correct.

But let me check if the

---------------

 critical point is indeed in the plane. Since we derived the parametrization from the plane, any s and t will give a point in the plane, so the critical point is valid.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using vectors and coordinate geometry another way for confirmation.

Another approach: Since we need to minimize MA · MC, perhaps we can consider this as a function over the plane and use calculus or geometric interpretations.

Alternatively, note that MA · MC can be expressed in terms of coordinates, but perhaps using vectors from the origin.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 using the formula:

MA · MC = (A - M) · (C - M) = (A - M) · (C - M).

Expanding this, it's equal to A·C - A·M - C·M + M·M.

But M·M is |M|²,

A·C is the dot product of vectors A and C,

Similarly, A·M is A · M,

C·M is C · M,

But maybe this isn't helpful. Alternatively, perhaps rewrite

---------------

 the expression:

MA · MC = |MA| |MC| cos(theta), where theta is the angle between them. But minimizing this might not be straightforward because it's a product involving cosine, which complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps consider

---------------

 that MA · MC = ( (A - M) · (C - M) )

= (A - M) · (C - M)

= A·C - A·M - C·M + M·M

= (A·C) - (A + C)·M + |M|².

Hmm, so this

---------------

 can be written as |M|² - (A + C)·M + (A·C).

This is a quadratic in terms of M. To minimize this expression, perhaps we can consider it as a function over the plane BA₁C₁. Since it's a quadratic function, the minimum occurs at the point where the gradient is orthogonal to the plane or something like that. Alternatively, maybe using projection.

Alternatively, let

---------------

 me think of this as a function f(M) = |M|² - (A + C)·M + (A·C). To minimize f(M) over M in the plane.

The minimum of a quadratic function over a plane can be found by projecting the "center" of the quadratic onto the plane.

Alternatively, the

---------------

 expression |M|² - (A + C)·M can be rewritten as |M - (A + C)/2|² - |(A + C)/2|², but let me check:

Let me complete the square.

Let me see:

|M|² - (A + C)·M = |M|² - (A + C)·M + |(A + C)/2|² - |(A + C)/2|²

= |M - (A + C)/2|² - |(A + C)/2|².

Therefore, f(M) = |M - (A + C)/2|² - |(A + C)/2|² + (A·C).

Simplify the constants:

- |(A + C)/2|² + A·C.

Let me compute that term:

Let me denote D = (A + C)/2,

then - |D|² + A·C.

Compute |D|² = ( (A + C)/2 )·( (A + C)/2 ) = (A·A + 2A·C + C·C)/4,

So - |D|² + A·C = - (A·A + 2A·C + C·C)/4 + A·C

= (-A·A -2A·C - C·C)/4 + (4A·C)/4

= (-A·A + 2A·C - C·C)/4

Hmm, perhaps not so helpful. Anyway, the key point is that f(M) can be written as |M - D|² + constant, so the minimum of f(M) over the plane is the square of the distance from D to the plane minus the constant term?

Wait, actually, since f(M) = |M - D|² + (constant), then the minimum of f(M) would be the minimum of |M - D|² plus the constant. The minimum of |M - D|² is the square of the distance from point D to the plane, so then the minimal value of f(M) would be (distance)^2 + constant.

Wait let me formal

---------------

ize this.

Let me set D = (A + C)/2. Then f(M) = |M - D|² - |D|² + A·C.

Wait, let me compute A·C. Since A is (0,0,0), and C is (2, 2√3,0), then A·C = 0*2 +0*2√3 +0*0 =0. Wait, that

---------------

's not right. Wait A is at origin, so vector OA is (0,0,0), so A·C would be the dot product of vectors OA and OC, which is indeed 0*2 +0*2√3 +0*0=0.

Wait, but then f(M) = |M - D|² - |D|² +0.

Therefore, f(M) = |M - D|² - |D|².

Therefore, the minimum of f(M) is the minimum of |M - D|² minus |D|². The minimum of |M - D|² over M in the plane is the square of the distance from D to the plane. Let me denote this minimal squared distance as d². Then the minimal value of f(M) is d² - |D|².

Therefore, the minimal value of MA · MC is d² - |D|², where d is the distance from D to the plane BA₁C₁, and D is the midpoint of A and C.

Wait

---------------

, let me verify this approach again.

Wait, let me recap:

We had MA · MC = |M|² - (A + C)·M + A·C,

then completing

---------------

 the square gives |M - D|² - |D|² + A·C,

where D is (A + C)/2,

since:

|M - D|² = |M|² - 2 D·M + |D|²,

so |M|² - (A + C)·M + A·C = ( |M - D|² + 2 D·M - |D|² ) - (A + C)·M + A·C,

Wait maybe I messed up the completion.

Wait let me do it step by step:

We have:

f(M) = |M|² - (A + C)·M + A·C.

Let me write |M - D|² = |M|² - 2 D·M + |D|²,

Therefore, rearranged:

|M|² = |M - D|² + 2 D·M - |D|².

Substitute into f(M):

f(M) = ( |M - D|² + 2 D·M - |D|² ) - (A + C)·M + A·C,

= |M - D|² + 2 D·M - |D|² - (A + C)·M + A·C,

Now, note that D = (A + C)/2, so 2 D = A + C,

Thus, 2 D·M = (A + C)·M,

Therefore,

f(M) = |M - D|² + (A + C)·M - |D|² - (A + C)·M + A·C,

The (A + C)·M terms cancel,

So f(M) = |M - D|² - |D|² + A·C.

But A·C = 0 as before

---------------

,

Therefore, f(M) = |M - D|² - |D|².

Therefore, the minimum of f(M) over the plane is equal to (distance from D to the plane)^2 - |D|².

Therefore, if

---------------

 we can compute the distance from point D to the plane BA₁C₁, then square it and subtract |D| squared, that would give the minimal value.

Let me compute that.

First, point D is the midpoint of A and C. Since A is (0,0,0) and C is (2, 2√3, 0), then D is (1, √3, 0).

Now, the plane equation was earlier found as -√3 x + y - √3 z + 2√3 =0, or rearranged as √3 x - y + √3 z = 2√3.

Wait, let me confirm the plane equation again. Let me recast it in standard form ax + by + cz + d =0.

Earlier, after computing

---------------

 the normal vector, the plane equation was:

-√3 x + y - √3 z + 2√3 =0,

So coefficients are:

a = -√3,

b = 1,

c = -√3,

d = 2√3.

Wait, but the

---------------

 distance from a point (x₀,y₀,z₀) to the plane ax + by + cz + d =0 is |a x₀ + b y₀ + c z₀ + d| / sqrt(a² + b² + c²).

So let

---------------

's compute the distance from D(1, √3, 0):

Compute numerator: | -√3*1 + 1*(√3) - √3*0 + 2√3 | = | -√3 + √3 +0 +2√3 | = |2√3| = 2√3.

Denominator: sqrt( ( (-√3)^2 +1^2 + (-√3)^2 )) = sqrt( 3 +1 +3 ) = sqrt(7).

Therefore, distance d = 2√3 / sqrt(7).

Therefore, squared distance is (2√3)^2 /7 = (4*3)/7 = 12/7.

Then the minimal value of f(M) = (12/7) - |D|².

Compute |D|²: coordinates of D are (1, √3,0),

so |D|² =1² + (√3)^2 +0 =1 +3=4.

Therefore, minimal value is 12/7 -4 = 12/7 -28/7 = -16/7. Which matches the previous result.

Therefore, the minimal value is indeed -16/7, so m = -16 and n=7? Wait, but m and n should be positive integers with the fraction in simplest terms. Since -16/7 is already reduced, but the problem mentions "the minimal value of ... which is m/n", so m

---------------

 and n are integers with no common factors, and the problem probably expects the absolute value? Wait, no, the problem just says the minimal value is m/n, so since

---------------

 it's negative, m would be -16 and n=7, but fractions are usually written with positive denominators, so perhaps m

---------------

 is numerator and n is denominator regardless of sign? The question says "the answer is of the form m/n", so likely m is -16 and n is7, but since m and n are probably required to be coprime integers with n positive, then m = -16 and n=7, so m +n= -16 +7= -9? But that can't be right, since the problem probably expects a positive answer. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the sign somewhere?

Wait let's check again. The minimal value is -16/7, so m is -16, n is7. But fractions

---------------

 are usually written with positive denominators, so if they want m and n positive integers, then perhaps the problem considers the absolute value? Wait, but the question says "the minimal value", so if the minimal value is negative, then m/n should be negative. But in Chinese math problems, sometimes they might expect

---------------

 the answer as a positive fraction, but the problem says "the answer is of the form m/n", so maybe m and n can be negative? But in

---------------

 the problem statement, it says "put your answer as Answer: $Answer", where $Answer is the answer to the problem. The original problem says

---------------

 "则向量MA · MC的最小值为。原始答案为 m/n 的格式，请给出 m + n 的值。" which translates to "then the minimal value of the vector MA · MC is. The original answer is in m/n format, please give the value of m +n."

Therefore, the

---------------

 problem is expecting m and n to be integers (probably positive, coprime) such that the minimal value is m/n, so even if the value is negative, m would be negative, so m +n is still

---------------

 an integer. But maybe in the problem's context, they might have considered the absolute value? Wait, but according to the calculation, it's -16/7, so m =-16, n=7, so m +n= -16+7= -9, but that's negative. However

---------------

, since fractions are usually written with positive denominators, perhaps the question expects m and n to be coprime integers with n positive, so m can be negative, but the sum m +n would still be -9, but that's not

---------------

 possible since the problem probably expects a positive answer.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the sign of the plane equation? Let me check the plane equation again.

Earlier steps:

The normal vector was found as (-4√3, 4, -4√3). Then,

---------------

 using point B(2,0,0):

-√3(x -2) +1*(y -0) -√3(z -0)=0,

Which is -√3 x +2√3 + y -√3 z =0,

So rearranged: -√3 x + y -√3 z +2√3 =0,

Alternatively, moving all terms to the other side: √3 x - y +√3 z = 2√3,

Which is the plane equation.

So the distance formula was computed correctly.

Wait, let

---------------

 me recalculate the distance:

Point D is (1, √3,0).

Plugging into the plane equation √3 x - y +√3 z = 2√3,

Left side: √3*1 - √3 + √3*0 = √3 - √3 =0,

Wait wait a second, hold on! Wait, this

---------------

 can't be right. If the point D(1,√3,0) is plugged into the plane equation √3 x - y + √3 z,

then it's √3*(1) - √3 + √3*0 = √3 - √3 =0,

So the left side is 0, but the right side is 2√3. Therefore, the distance should be |0 -2√3| / sqrt( (√3)^2 + (-1)^2 + (√3)^2 )?

Wait, hold on, the

---------------

 plane equation can be written as √3 x - y + √3 z -2√3 =0,

so the distance formula is |√3*1 -1*(√3) +√3*0 -2√3| / sqrt( (√3)^2 + (-1)^2 + (√3)^2 )

Compute numerator:

√3*1 - √3 +0 -2√3 = (√3 - √3) -2√3 = -2√3,

Absolute value is | -2√3 | =2√3,

Denominator:

sqrt(3 +1 +3)=sqrt(7),

Therefore, distance is 2√3 / sqrt(7),

which

---------------

 is the same as before. So squared distance is (2√3)^2 /7 = 12/7,

So

---------------

 the previous calculation is correct. However, the point D lies on the plane? Wait, no. Wait when plugging into √3 x - y + √3 z =2√3,

For

---------------

 D(1,√3,0):

√3*1 -√3 +√3*0 =0, which equals 0, but the right side is 2√3. So D is not on the plane, so the distance is 2√3/sqrt(7).

Therefore, calculations are correct.

So the minimal value is indeed -16/7. Therefore m =-16, n=7, so m +n = -16 +7 =-9. But that's a negative number, which is odd. Maybe the problem expects the absolute value? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of the dot product?

Wait let me re-examine the expression for MA · MC.

Earlier, I had MA · MC = x² + y² + z² -2x -2√3 y,

But let me confirm this again.

MA is ( -x, -y, -z )

MC is (2 -x, 2√3 - y, -z )

Dot product:

(-x)(2 -x) + (-y)(2√3 - y) + (-z)(-z)

First term: -2x +x²,

Second term: -2√3 y + y²,

Third term: z²,

Total: x² + y² + z² -2x -2√3 y + z²? Wait wait, hold on, third term is (-z)(-z)=z², so total z².

---------------

 Wait, so total is x² + y² + z² -2x -2√3 y. Yes, that's correct.

Wait but in the param

---------------

etrization, when I substituted, I had z =2s +2t, so z² is part of the expression, but in the alternative

---------------

 method, the expression was correct.

Wait, but maybe the problem is asking for the minimal value, and even if it's negative, then m is -16 and n=7, so m +n is -9. But maybe I made an error in the problem setup?

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in interpreting the coordinates.

Wait let me check coordinates again.

Given AB=2, AA₁=2, AD=2√3.

Setting

---------------

 A at (0,0,0),

AB is along x-axis to B(2,0,0),

AD is along y-axis to D(0, 2√3, 0),

AA₁ is along z-axis to A₁(0,0,2).

Therefore, point C is (2, 2√3,0),

C₁ is (2, 2√3, 2),

B₁ is (2,0,2),

So

---------------

 the plane BA₁C₁ is through points B(2,0,0), A₁(0,0,2), and C₁(2,2√3,2).

The

---------------

 coordinates are correct.

Wait, the midpoint D between A and C is (1, √3, 0), which is correct.

The plane equation was

---------------

 derived correctly.

Hmm, so calculations seem correct. Therefore, the minimal value is indeed -16/7, so m =-16 and n=7, so m +n= -9. But the problem might expect m and n to be positive. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the direction of vectors?

Wait the problem says "向量MA · 向量MC" which is vector MA · vector MC, which is the same as (A - M) · (C - M). So

---------------

 the calculation is correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem requires the minimal value in absolute terms? But the question says "最小值", which is "minimum value", so it should be the actual minimum, which is negative.

Alternatively, maybe I messed up the sign in the plane equation? Let me recheck.

The normal vector was computed as BA₁ × BC₁ = (-4√3,4,-4√3). The plane equation using point B(2,0,0):

-4√3 (x -2) +4(y -0) -4√3(z -0)=0,

Divide both sides by 4:

-√3(x -2) + y -√3 z =0,

Which simplifies to:

-√3 x + 2√3 + y -√3 z=0,

Thus

---------------

,

-√3 x + y -√3 z + 2√3 =0,

Which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in the coordinate system? Maybe I should have set another

---------------

 coordinate system?

Alternatively, let me try a different approach.

Let me consider that MA · MC can be written as:

MA · MC = (A - M) · (C - M) = (A - M) · (C - M).

Expand this:

= A·C - A·M - C·M + M·M

= (A·C) - (A + C)·M + |M|².

To find the minimum of this expression over all M in the plane.

This is equivalent to minimizing |M|² - (A + C)·M + constant.

This is a quadratic function in M. The minimum occurs at the point M where the gradient is zero, which is the same as the projection of (A + C)/2 onto the plane? Wait, maybe.

Alternatively, the minimum of |M|² - (A + C)·M is achieved at the point M that is the projection of the point (A + C)/2 onto the plane, but with some scaling?

Alternatively, let

---------------

 me think of this as minimizing f(M) = |M|² - (A + C)·M over the plane.

The minimum of f(M) occurs where the gradient of f is orthogonal to the plane.

The gradient of f with respect to M is 2M - (A + C). So setting this equal to a scalar multiple of the plane's normal vector.

Let me formalize this.

Let me denote the gradient ∇f = 2M - (A + C).

This gradient must be parallel to the plane's normal vector n. Because at the minimum, the direction of steepest ascent is perpendicular to the plane, hence parallel to the normal vector.

So, ∇f = λ n, for some scalar λ.

Therefore,

2M - (A + C) = λ n,

where n is the normal vector of the plane.

Additionally, M lies on the plane.

So we have two equations:

1) 2M - (A + C) = λ n,

2) M lies on the plane.

We can solve these equations for M and λ.

Let me express this in coordinates.

First, let me write vectors as coordinates.

Let me denote:



---------------

A is (0,0,0),

C is (2, 2√3,0),

so A + C is (2, 2√3,0).

The normal vector n to the plane is (-√3,1,-√3) as before (divided by 4).

Wait, earlier the normal vector was (-√3,1,-√3). Let me confirm:

The normal vector computed was (-4√3,4,-4√3), so dividing by 4 gives (-√3,1,-√3). So n = (-√3,1,-√3).

Therefore, equation 1:

2M - (2, 2√3,0) = λ*(-√3,1,-√3).

Let me denote M as (x,y,z). Then:

2x -2 = -λ√3,

2y - 2√3 = λ*1,

2z -0 = -λ√3.

So three equations:

1) 2x -2 = -λ√3,

2) 2y - 2√3 = λ,

3) 2z = -λ√3.

Additionally, equation 2: M lies on the plane: -√3 x + y -√3 z +2√3 =0.

We can solve these equations step by step.

From equation 2: λ = 2y -2√3,

From equation 3: 2z = - (2y -2√3) *√3,

=> 2z = -2y√3 + 2*3,

=> 2z = -2√3 y +6,

=> z = -√3 y +3,

From equation 1:

2x -2 = - (2y -2√3) *√3,

Expand RHS:

-2y√3 +2√3*√3,

= -2√3 y + 2*3,

= -2√3 y +6,

Thus,

2x -2 = -2√3 y +6,

=> 2x = -2√3 y +8,

=> x = -√3 y +4.

Now, substitute x and z in terms of y into the plane equation:

-√3 x + y -√3 z +2√3 =0,

Substituting x= -√3 y +4 and z= -√3 y +3,

Compute each term:

-√3 x = -√3*(-√3 y +4) = (√3)^2 y -4√3 = 3y -4√3,

y term remains y,

-√3 z = -√3*(-√3 y +3) = (√3)^2 y -3√3 = 3y -3√3,

Adding all terms:

(3y -4√3) + y + (3y -3√3) +2√3 =0,

Combine like terms:

3y + y +3y =7y,

-4√3 -3√3 +2√3 = (-5√3),

Thus equation becomes:

7y -5√3 =0,

=> 7y =5√3,

=> y= (5√3)/7.

Now compute x and z:

x = -√3*(5√3/7) +4 = - (3*5)/7 +4 = -15/7 +28/7 =13/7,

z = -√3*(5√3/7) +3 = - (3*5)/7 +3 = -15/7 +21/7=6/7.

Therefore, the point M that minimizes the expression is (13/7, 5√3/7, 6/7).

Now, let's compute MA · MC using this point.

Coordinates of M: (13/7,5√3/7,6/7),

Coordinates of A: (0,0,0),

Coordinates of C: (2,2√3,0).

Compute vectors MA and MC:

MA = A - M = (-13/7, -5√3/7, -6/7),

MC = C - M = (2 -13/7, 2√3 -5√3/7, 0 -6/7),

Compute components:

2 -13/7 = (14 -13)/7 =1/7,

2√3 =14√3/7,

so 14√3/7 -5√3/7 =9√3/7,

and the z-component is -6/7.

So MC = (1/7, 9√3/7, -6/7).

Now compute the dot product MA · MC:

(-13/7)(1/7) + (-5√3/7)(9√3/7) + (-6/7)(-6/7).

Compute each term:

First term: (-13)(1)/(49) = -13/49,

Second term: (-5√3)(9√3)/(49) = (-5*9)*(√3)^2 /49 = (-45)*(3)/49 = -135/49,

Third term: (-6)(-6)/49 =36/49,

Adding them all together:

-13/49 -135/49 +36/49 = (-13 -135 +36)/49 = (-112)/49 = -16/7.

Same result as before. So this confirms the minimal value is indeed -16/7, so m is -16, n is7, so m +n= -9. But the problem says

---------------

 "请给出 m + n 的值", which is "please give the value of m +n". Since m and n are numerator and denominator in reduced form, and they must be integers with no common factors. Since -16 and7 are coprime, the answer is -16+7= -9. But negative? That seems odd. Maybe there's an error in the problem's translation or my understanding.

Wait, the problem says "则向量MA · MC的最小值为。原始答案为 m/n 的格式，请给出 m + n 的值。" which translates to "then the minimal value of the vector MA · MC is. The original answer is in m/n format, please give the value of m +n."

The

---------------

 minimal value is a fraction m/n, which is -16/7, so m is -16 and n is7. Since

---------------

 fractions can have negative numerators, the question likely accepts m as negative. Thus m +n is -16+7= -9. But the

---------------

 problem might expect the absolute value? Or maybe I made a mistake in calculation?

Wait another way to think: maybe the problem is in Chinese, and sometimes in Chinese math problems, fractions are presented with positive numerators and denominators, so perhaps the minimal value is 16/7, but that would be the maximum?

Wait, but our calculation clearly shows it's negative. Let me check with an example point.

Suppose point M is point B. Let's compute MA · MC when M is B(2,0,0).

MA = A - B = (-2,0,0),

MC = C - B = (0, 2√3,0),

Dot product: (-2)(0) +0*(2√3) +0*0=0. So 0.

If M is at A₁(0,0,2):

MA = A - A₁ = (0,0,-2),

MC = C - A₁ = (2,2√3,-2),

Dot product:0*2 +0*2√3 + (-2)*(-2)=4,

Which is positive.

If M is at point C₁ (2,2√3,2):

MA = A - C₁ = (-2, -2√3, -2),

MC = C - C₁ = (0,0,-2),

Dot product: (-2)(0) + (-2√3)(0) + (-2)(-2)=4,

Again

---------------

 positive.

If M is at point D (the midpoint), which is (1,√3,0):

MA = (-1, -√3,0),

MC = (1, √3,0),

Dot product: (-1)(1) + (-√3)(√3) +0*0= -1 -3 = -4,

Which is -4, which is less than 0, but greater

---------------

 than -16/7≈-2.2857.

Hmm, so the minimal value is indeed less than -4? Wait but according to our calculation it's -16/7≈-2.2857, which is greater than -4. Wait, so

---------------

 maybe my calculation is wrong?

Wait when M is at (1,√3,0), the midpoint D, then the value is -4, but according to our previous result, the minimal is -16/7≈-2.2857, which is higher than -4. That suggests that maybe the minimal is even lower? But according to the calculations, the critical point gives a higher value than the midpoint?

Wait there must be a mistake here.

Wait wait, let me compute MA · MC at point M=(13/7,5√3/7,6/7):

MA · MC = -16/7≈-2.2857,

but at midpoint D (1,√3,0), it's -4.

Wait

---------------

 that's a contradiction, which means I must have messed up.

Wait let me recalculate MA · MC at point D.

Point D is (1, √3, 0).

MA = A - D = (-1, -√3, 0),

MC = C - D = (2 -1, 2√3 -√3, 0 -0) = (1, √3, 0),

Dot product: (-1)(1) + (-√3)(√3) +0*0 = -1 -3 = -4.

But according to our previous result, the minimal value is -16/7≈-2.2857 which is higher than -4. That suggests that the minimal value is actually lower than that, so my calculation must be wrong.

This is a problem. There must be an error in my approach.

Wait let me check the critical point coordinates:

Earlier, using the parametrization with s=1/14 and t=5/14,

Coordinates of M are:

x =2 -2*(1/14)=2 -1/7=13/7≈1.857,

y=2√3*(5/14)= (10√3)/14=5√3/7≈1.285,

z=2*(1/14)+2*(5/14)= (2 +10)/14=12/14=6/7≈0.857.

So M is at (13/7,5√3/7,6/7).

Compute MA · MC:

MA = A - M = (-13/7, -5√3/7, -6/7),

MC = C - M = (2 -13/7, 2√3 -5√3/7, -6/7),

Wait wait, the z-coordinate of C is 0, so MC's z-component is 0 -6/7 = -6/7.

Wait yes

---------------

, so:

MC's components:

x: 2 -13/7= (14-13)/7=1/7,

y: 2√3 -5√3/7= (14√3 -5√3)/7=9√3/7,

z:0 -6/7= -6/7,

So MC=(1/7, 9√3/7, -6/7),

MA=(-13/7, -5√3/7, -6/7).

Dot product:

(-13/7)(1/7) + (-5√3/7)(9√3/7) + (-6/7)(-6/7),

First term: -13/49,

Second term: (-5√3)(9√3)= -5*9*3= -135, so -135/49,

Third term: 36/49,

Total: (-13 -135 +36)/49 = (-112)/49 = -16/7≈-2.2857,

But at point D(1,√3,0), the value is -4, which is lower. This suggests that my critical point is a local maximum?

Wait that's a problem. Because

---------------

 if the function has a critical point which is a local minimum, but there exists a point with lower value, that means the critical point is actually a maximum?

Hmm, this indicates that my earlier assumption that the critical point is a minimum is wrong. So

---------------

 where is the mistake?

Let me re-examine the quadratic function f(s,t)=8s² +16t² +8st -4s -12t,

We found a critical point at s=1/14, t=5/14,

But when substituting s and t,

---------------

 we get a value of -16/7≈-2.2857,

But at point D, which corresponds to some s and t?

Wait, let

---------------

 me see. To get to point D(1,√3,0), we need to find s and t such that:

x=2 -2s =1 => 2-2s=1 => s=0.5,

y=2√3 t=√3 => t=1/2,

z=2s +2t,

With s=0.5 and t=0.5,

z=2*(0.5)+2*(0.5)=1+1=2,

But the point D has z-coordinate 0, so that's inconsistent. So point D is not in the plane BA₁C₁.

Wait a second! Point D is the midpoint of A and C, which is (1,√3,0). But this point is not on the plane BA₁C₁. Therefore, when I calculated MA · MC at point D, that point is not in the plane, so it's irrelevant. So my mistake was evaluating at a point not in the plane.

Therefore, the minimal value is indeed -16/7, which is approximately -2.2857, and point D is not in the plane, so the minimal value is correct.

Therefore, the answer should be m + n = -16 +7 =-9? But the problem likely expects positive integers. Maybe I messed up the sign in the expression.

Wait let me re-express the problem again

---------------

.

The problem says "向量MA · 向量MC的最小值", which is the minimum of the dot product of vectors MA and MC. The dot product can indeed be negative, so the minimal value is -16/7. However

---------------

, in the problem's context, maybe they want the answer as a positive fraction, so perhaps I made a mistake in the sign during the calculation.

Wait let me check the vectors

---------------

 again. MA is from M to A, and MC is from M to C. So vectors MA and MC are pointing towards A and C from M. The dot product's minimum can indeed be negative.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires the minimal value in absolute terms, but the question explicitly says "最小值", which is the minimum value, so negative is acceptable.

However, since the problem asks for m and n to be integers with the answer as m/n, and m +n, then

---------------

 m=-16 and n=7, so m +n=-9. But in Chinese math problems, often fractions are presented with positive numerators and denominators, so maybe I made an error in the sign during the calculation.

Wait let me check the expression for MA · MC again:

MA · MC = (A - M) · (C - M).

Exp

---------------

anding this:

= A·C - A·M - C·M + M·M,

= A·C - (A + C)·M + |M|².

Alternatively, perhaps I should have written the vectors as vectors from M to A and M to C:

MA is vector from M to A: A - M,

MC is vector from M to C: C - M,

Their

---------------

 dot product is (A - M) · (C - M).

Alternatively, if someone mistakenly took vectors as MA and MC as vectors from A and C to M, then the calculation would differ, but the problem says 向量MA · 向量MC, which is vectors from M to A and M to C.

Wait,

---------------

 in Chinese, 向量MA is the vector from M to A, yes. Because in Chinese notation, 向量AB is the vector from A to B, so 向量MA is from M to A.

Thus the calculation is correct.

Therefore, the minimal value is indeed -16/7, so m +n is -16 +7 = -9. But since the problem asks for m +n, and the

---------------

 answer is to be given as a number, perhaps it's a trick question? Or maybe I made an error in the plane equation?

Wait let me recalculate the distance from D to the plane:

Wait point D is (1,√3,0),

Plane equation: √3 x - y +√3 z =2√3,

Plug in D's coordinates:

√3*1 - √3 +√3*0 =0 ≠2√3,

So distance is |0 -2√3| / sqrt( (√3)^2 + (-1)^2 + (√3)^2 )

Which is 2√3/sqrt(7),

Squared distance is 12/7,

Then f(M) = (distance)^2 - |D|² =12/7 - (1^2 + (√3)^2 +0^2)=12/7 - (1+3)=12/7 -4= -16/7,

So

---------------

 this is correct.

Therefore, the answer is -16/7, so m +n =-16+7= -9. However, the problem might expect the answer in positive terms, perhaps I missed an absolute value or there's a different interpretation.

Alternatively, maybe I should have considered the other

---------------

 direction of the normal vector?

The normal vector could be pointing in the opposite direction, but that would just flip the sign of the plane equation, but the distance would remain the same.

Alternatively, maybe the problem requires

---------------

 the minimal value of |MA · MC|, but the question doesn't say that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem

---------------

 setup. Wait, the problem states "M为平面B A₁C₁内的一点", so M is inside the plane BA₁C₁, so the

---------------

 minimal value is indeed -16/7.

Given that the problem specifies the answer as m/n with m and n integers, and asks for m +n, I think the answer is -9, but since the problem might expect positive integers, maybe there's a miscalculation.

Wait let me check once more the coordinates

---------------

 of the critical point M(13/7,5√3/7,6/7),

Compute the plane equation:

√3 x - y +√3 z = ?

Plug in:

√3*(13/7) - (5√3/7) +√3*(6/7) = (√3/7)(13 -5 +6)= (√3/7)(14)=2√3,

Which matches the plane equation. So M is indeed on the plane.

Therefore

---------------

, the calculation is correct. So the answer must be -16/7, so m +n =-9.

However, since the problem is likely expecting a positive answer, perhaps the minimal value is 16/7 and the question had a typo, but according to all calculations, it's -16/7.

Alternatively, maybe I messed

---------------

 up the sign in the expression MA · MC.

Wait let me recompute MA · MC for the critical point:

MA = (-13/7, -5√3/7, -6/7),

MC = (1/7, 9√3/7, -6/7),

Dot product:

(-13/7)(1/7) + (-5√3/7)(9√3/7) + (-6/7)(-6/7),

First term: -13/49,

Second term: (-5√3)(9√3) = -45*(3) =-135 → -135/49,

Third term: 36/49,

Total: (-13 -135 +36)/49 = (-112)/49 = -16/7,

Yes, correct.

Therefore, I think the answer is indeed -16/7, so m +n= -16+7= -9. Since the problem didn't specify that m and n must be positive, just that the answer is in m/n format, I

---------------

 think this is correct.

But since the problem might expect positive integers, perhaps there's an error in the problem's translation or my interpretation. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the direction

---------------

 of vectors.

Wait another thought: the problem says "长方体", which is a rectangular prism, but in my coordinate system, the edges are AB=2, AA₁=2, AD=2√3. The edges are mutually perpendicular, so the coordinates are correct.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal value is the

---------------

 absolute value? But the problem says "最小值", which is minimum, so the negative value is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the minimal value of |MA · MC|, but that's not what's stated.

Given that all calculations confirm -16/7, I will proceed with that.

**Final Answer**
Answer: -9


To solve the problem of finding the minimum value of \(\overrightarrow{MA} \cdot \overrightarrow{MC}\) for a point \(M\) in the plane \(BA_1C_1\) of the rectangular prism \(ABCD-A_1B_1C_1D_1\) with given dimensions \(AB = AA_1 = 2\) and \(AD = 2\sqrt{3}\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Coordinate Setup**:
   - Assign coordinates to the vertices:
     - \(A(0, 0, 0)\), \(B(2, 0, 0)\), \(D(0, 2\sqrt{3}, 0)\), \(A_1(0, 0, 2)\), \(C(2, 2\sqrt{3}, 0)\), \(C_1(2, 2\sqrt{3}, 2)\).

2. **Plane Equation**:
   - The plane \(BA_1C_1\) is determined using points \(B(2, 0, 0)\), \(A_1(0, 0, 2)\), and \(C_1(2, 2\sqrt{3}, 2)\).
   - The normal vector is found using the cross product of vectors \(BA_1\) and \(BC_1\), resulting in the plane equation \(\sqrt{3}x - y + \sqrt{3}z = 2\sqrt{3}\).

3. **Parametrization of Point \(M\)**:
   - Parametrize \(M\) using vectors from \(B\) to \(A_1\) and \(C_1\):
     - \(M = (2 - 2s, 2\sqrt{3}t, 2s + 2t)\).

4. **Expression for Dot Product**:
   - Express \(\overrightarrow{MA} \cdot \overrightarrow{MC}\) in terms of coordinates:
     - \(\overrightarrow{MA} \cdot \overrightarrow{MC} = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2x - 2\sqrt{3}y\).

5. **Substitute Parametrization**:
   - Substitute \(x = 2 - 2s\), \(y = 2\sqrt{3}t\), \(z = 2s + 2t\) into the expression and simplify:
     - Resulting quadratic function in \(s\) and \(t\): \(8s^2 + 16t^2 + 8st - 4s - 12t\).

6. **Critical Points**:
   - Solve the system of equations from partial derivatives:
     - \(s = \frac{1}{14}\), \(t = \frac{5}{14}\).
     - Coordinates of \(M\) are \(\left(\frac{13}{7}, \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{7}, \frac{6}{7}\right)\).

7. **Compute Minimum Value**:
   - Calculate the dot product at the critical point:
     - \(\overrightarrow{MA} \cdot \overrightarrow{MC} = -\frac{16}{7}\).

8. **Result**:
   - The minimum value is \(-\frac{16}{7}\), leading to \(m = -16\) and \(n = 7\).
   - Sum \(m + n = -16 + 7 = -9\).
