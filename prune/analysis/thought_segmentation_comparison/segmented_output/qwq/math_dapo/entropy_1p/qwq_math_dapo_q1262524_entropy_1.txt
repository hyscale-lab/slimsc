Okay, so I need to solve this problem about Pick's Formula and figure out the greatest possible value of the ratio n = I/B where Pat mistakenly swapped I and B, leading to an area that was too small by 35. Hmm. Let me start by recalling Pick's Formula properly. 

Pick’s Formula states that the area A of a polygon with integer coordinates is A = I + (B/2) - 1, where I is the number of interior lattice points and B is the number of boundary lattice points. 

Pat used the formula but swapped I and B, so Pat calculated the area as A' = B + (I/2) - 1. The problem says this incorrect calculation was too small by 35, so the actual area A is 35 more than Pat's result. Therefore, we can write the equation:

A = A' + 35  
But since A is also equal to I + (B/2) - 1, substituting gives:

I + (B/2) - 1 = [B + (I/2) - 1] + 35

Let me write that out step by step. 

Original formula:  
A = I + (B/2) - 1  

Pat's incorrect formula:  
A' = B + (I/2) - 1  

Given that A = A' + 35, so:

I + (B/2) - 1 = B + (I/2) - 1 + 35

Let me simplify both sides. Let's subtract the right-hand side from both sides to see the difference, but maybe it's easier to rearrange the equation. 

First, subtract the right-hand side from both sides:

I + (B/2) - 1 - [B + (I/2) - 1] = 35

Simplify the left side:

I + (B/2) -1 - B - (I/2) + 1 = 35

Combine like terms:

I - (I/2) + (B/2 - B) + (-1 +1) = 35  
Which simplifies to:

(I/2) - (B/2) = 35  
Multiply both sides by 2:

I - B = 70

So, we have the equation I - B = 70.

Additionally, the problem states that the ratio n = I/B is an integer, and we need the greatest possible value of n.

So, we need to maximize n = I/B, given that I - B =70 and n is an integer.

Let me write I = B +70. Then n = (B +70)/B = 1 + 70/B. Since n must be an integer, 70/B must also be an integer. Therefore, B must be a divisor of 70. 

Wait, but we also have to remember that in Pick's formula, B counts the number of boundary points. For a polygon on a lattice, B must be a positive integer, and I must also be a non-negative integer. Also, since I = B +70, then B can't be so large that I would be negative, but since B is positive, I is at least 71 (if B is 1). But we need to ensure that the polygon actually exists with those values. Hmm, but maybe the constraints from Pick's theorem are more involved?

Wait, maybe there's more constraints. Let me recall that in Pick's theorem, the area must be a positive number, so I + (B/2) -1 must be positive. Also, for a polygon, B must be at least 3 (since a polygon must have at least 3 sides, hence at least 3 boundary points). But actually, even a triangle on a lattice has at least 3 boundary points. So B must be an integer greater or equal to 3, and I must be a non-negative integer. 

Additionally, the

---------------

 formula requires that B and I are integers. Since we already have I = B +70, and n = I/B must be an integer, let's think

---------------

 again. 

Since n = (B +70)/B must be an integer. Let me denote n = k, so k = 1 + 70/B. Therefore, 70/B must be an integer, so B must divide 70. 

Therefore, possible values of B are the positive divisors of 70. Since B must divide 70, the divisors of 70 are: 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35, 70. 

But as mentioned, B must be at least 3 (since a polygon can't have less than 3 boundary points). So possible B values are 5,7,10,14,35,70. 

Wait, hold on, 1 and 2 are excluded. So starting from B=5 upwards. 

We

---------------

 need to maximize k = (B +70)/B = 1 + 70/B. To maximize k, we need to minimize B. Wait, but that

---------------

 would give a higher value? Wait, actually, if B is smaller, 70/B is larger, so k is larger. Therefore, the smallest possible B (which

---------------

 is 5 here) would give the largest k. Wait, but let me check:

If B=5, then k = (5 +70)/5 =75/5=15. 

If B=7, then k=(7+70)/7=77/7=11.

If B=10, then (10+70)/10=80/10=8.

B=14: 14+70=84/14=6.

B=35: 35+70=105/35=3.

B=70: 70+70=140/70=2.

So, the largest possible k here is 15, when B=5. 

But wait, but hold on. Before

---------------

 jumping to the conclusion, we need to check if such a polygon can actually exist with B=5 and I=75. Because Pick

---------------

's theorem has some constraints. 

For instance, in Pick's formula, the area must equal I + B/2 -1. So,

---------------

 if B=5 and I=75, then the area would be 75 +5/2 -1 = 75 +2.5 -1=76.5. But area must be a positive real number, which it is, but polygons on lattice points must have areas that are half-integers? Wait, actually, the area according to Pick's theorem can be a half-integer, yes. For example, a triangle with base and height 1 would have area 0.5, which would correspond to I=0 and B=3, so 0 + 3/2 -1 = 0.5. 

So 76.5 is okay. But perhaps

---------------

 there's another constraint? For instance, the number of boundary points B must satisfy certain conditions with the actual edges of the polygon. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem allows any I and B as long as they satisfy the equation I - B =70 and n is integer, but the problem says "using the correct values for I and B", so they must correspond to some actual polygon. 

Therefore, perhaps there are additional constraints from Pick's theorem. For instance, in Pick's theorem, the area must be equal to I + B/2 -1, so the area must be at least 1 (since the smallest polygon is a triangle with area 0.5, but maybe

---------------

 that's allowed). Wait, actually a polygon can have area 0.5. So maybe the only constraints are that I and B are non-negative integers with B ≥ 3, and that the area is positive. 

Wait, but in

---------------

 the problem statement, it says "the vertices of a polygon all lie on a rectangular lattice". So it's a polygon with vertices on lattice points, but the edges can go through other lattice points. 

However

---------------

, there is also the condition that for any polygon, the number of boundary points B must satisfy certain properties. For instance, each edge of the polygon must have at least 2 lattice points (its endpoints). The number of edges is equal to the number of sides, which is at least 3. 

But maybe the key point here is that for a polygon with B boundary points, each edge contributes at least 1 lattice point (the vertices), but actually, each edge between two vertices will have exactly

---------------

 gcd(delta_x, delta_y) +1 lattice points, where delta_x and delta_y are the differences in coordinates. So the total number of boundary points B is equal to the sum over edges of gcd(delta_x, delta_y) for each edge. 

Therefore, B must be at least the number of edges (since each edge contributes at least 1, but actually more if the edge is longer). 



---------------

However, maybe this complicates things. Since the problem doesn't specify any further constraints, maybe we can assume that as long as B and I are integers with B ≥3 and I ≥0, and the area is positive (so I + B/2 -1 ≥0), then such a polygon exists? 

Wait

---------------

, let's check for B=5 and I=75. The area would be 75 + 5/2 -1 = 75 +2.5 -1 = 76.5. That seems okay. 

But maybe there is another constraint from Pick's theorem that relates I and B? For example, maybe

---------------

 the area must be at least something? Not sure. Let me think. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the only constraints are that B divides 70, B ≥3, and I = B +70 is non-negative, so the

---------------

 maximum n is 15. 

However, let me check with B=5. Let's see if a polygon with B=5 and I=75 is possible. 

Wait, a polygon with only 5 boundary points. Let's consider that. For example, a convex polygon with 5 vertices? But each edge between two vertices would contribute lattice points. 

Wait, the

---------------

 minimal B for a polygon with m edges is m, but actually, each edge between two vertices can have more lattice points. For example, a square with side length 1 has 4 vertices and each edge has 2 points (so total boundary points 4, since the corners are counted once each). Wait, actually, each edge of a unit square has endpoints only, so each edge contributes 2 points, but since they are shared between edges, total boundary points would be 4. 

Wait, in

---------------

 general, for a polygon with m edges, the number of boundary points is the sum over edges of (gcd(delta_x, delta_y) for each edge). 

So for a polygon with 5 boundary points, that would require that the total sum over edges of gcd(delta_x, delta_y) is 5. Since each edge must have at least 1 (the endpoints), so for a polygon with m edges, the minimal B is m. So for a triangle (3 edges), minimal B is 3. For a quadrilateral (4 edges), minimal B is 4, etc. 

Therefore, if B=5, then the polygon could be a triangle with edges that have some lattice points along them. 

Wait, let's see an example. Let's try to make a polygon with B=5. 

Suppose a triangle where each side has one lattice point in between. For example, take a right triangle with legs of length 2. The vertices at (0,0), (2,0), (0,2). The edges: from (0,0) to (2,0): has 3 points (including endpoints). From (2,0) to (0,2): the difference is (-2,2). The gcd of 2 and 2 is 2, so number of points on that edge is gcd(2,2)+1 = 3. Similarly, the edge from (0,2) to (0,0): 

---------------

3 points. 

Wait, but then total boundary points would be 3 + 3 + 3 - 3 (since the vertices are counted twice) = 6 - 3? Wait no, actually when you add up all the edges' points, you have to subtract the vertices because they are counted twice. Wait, perhaps the formula is that B = sum_{edges} (gcd(delta_x, delta_y) +1) - m, where m is the number of edges (since each vertex is counted in two edges). Wait, maybe better

---------------

 to think of each edge contributes (gcd(delta_x, delta_y) +1) points, but each vertex is shared by two edges. 

Wait, actually, the total number of boundary points B is equal to the sum over all edges of (gcd(delta_x, delta_y) for that edge). Because each edge between two vertices has gcd(delta_x, delta_y) steps, so the number of lattice points on the edge is gcd(delta_x, delta_y) +1, but when you traverse the polygon, each vertex is counted in two edges, so when you add up all edges' (gcd +1), you get B + m, where m is the number of edges (since each vertex is counted twice, so subtract m). Therefore, B = sum_{edges} gcd(delta_x, delta_y). 

Therefore, for each edge, the number of lattice points on it is gcd(delta_x, delta_y) +1, so the total lattice points on all edges would be sum (gcd +1) over edges, which equals B + m. Hence, B = sum(gcd) over edges. 

Therefore, to have B=5, the sum of gcds over all edges must be 5. Let's see. Let's take a triangle (3 edges). Then, to have sum of gcds equal to 5. Let me see: for

---------------

 example, one edge with gcd 2, and the other two edges with gcd 1 each. So 2+1+1=4. Not enough. To

---------------

 get 5, perhaps one edge with gcd 3, and two edges with gcd 1. 3+1+1=5. 

Is that possible? Let's try to construct such a triangle. 

Suppose we have a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (3,0), and (0,1). 

First edge from (0,0) to (3,0): delta_x=3, delta_y=0. gcd(3,0)=3. So that edge contributes 3 to the sum. 

Second edge from (3,0) to (0,1): delta_x=-3, delta_y=1. gcd(3,1)=1. 

Third edge from (0,1) to (0,0): delta_x=0, delta_y=-1. gcd(0,1)=1. 

Thus total B=3+1+1=5. 

Therefore, such a triangle exists with B=5. So that's possible. 

So in this case, the boundary points are 5, so that works. Then I would need to be 75? Wait, but in this case, the area would be I + B/2 -1. Let's calculate the area of that triangle first. 

The triangle with vertices (0,0), (3,0), (0,1). The area is (base * height)/2 = (3 *1)/2 = 1.5. 

But according to Pick's formula, that

---------------

 area should equal I + B/2 -1. 

So 1.5 = I + 5/2 -1 → I + 1.5 = 1.5 → I = 0. 

But in our problem, we have I = B +70, so if B=5, then I=75, which would give an area of 75 + 5/2 -1 = 76.5. That's way larger than the actual area of 1.5. 

Ah, so that shows a problem. The

---------------

 example I just made has B=5 and I=0, but the problem requires that I = B +70. So in

---------------

 this case, such a polygon can't have I=75 if B=5. 

Therefore, my mistake was assuming that any B and I satisfying I - B =70 would work, but actually, Pick's theorem requires

---------------

 that the area must be equal to I + B/2 -1. Therefore, the values of I and B must also satisfy that the area is consistent with some polygon. 

Therefore, in

---------------

 order to have I = B +70, the area would be I + B/2 -1 = (B +70) + B/2 -1 = (3B/2) +69. 

But this area must also be equal to the actual area of some polygon with those B and I. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows for any I and B as long as they are integers with B ≥3, I ≥0, and the area is positive, but in reality, there are more constraints. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is set

---------------

 in such a way that we don't have to worry about the actual existence of the polygon, and just work with the algebra given. The problem says "using the correct values for I and B", so they must satisfy Pick's formula for some polygon, so perhaps we need to ensure that the area computed via Pick's formula is possible. 

Wait, but how

---------------

 do we know that there exists a polygon with given B and I? That might be complicated, but perhaps the problem is designed so that we can ignore that and just use

---------------

 the equation I - B =70 and n = I/B is integer, so the maximum n is 15. However, in the example above, that

---------------

 would require I=75 and B=5, but such a polygon would have an area of 76.5, but if

---------------

 you can find a polygon with such a large I and small B, maybe it's possible. 

Alternatively, perhaps I and B must satisfy some

---------------

 inequality. For example, in Pick's theorem, the area must be at least 1 (if it's a triangle with area 0.5, but maybe the problem allows that). Wait, but the

---------------

 area when I=0 and B=3 would be 0 + 3/2 -1 = 0.5, which is acceptable. 

But in our case, if

---------------

 I = B +70, then the area is (3B/2) +69. Since area must be positive, this is always true as B is positive. 

However, another constraint comes from Euler's formula for planar graphs? Wait, perhaps not necessary here. 

Alternatively, maybe there is a relation between I and B in Pick's theorem. Let me think. For a polygon, the number of interior points I and boundary points B must satisfy some inequality? 

Wait

---------------

, according to Pick's theorem, the area is I + B/2 -1. Since the area must be at least 0.5 (for a minimal triangle), so I + B/2 -1 ≥ 0.5 → I + B/2 ≥ 1.5. But with I = B +70, that would give B +70 + B/2 ≥ 1.5 → (3B)/2 +70 ≥1.5, which is always true for positive B. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting

---------------

 that we can proceed purely algebraically, given that the problem states "using the correct values for I and B", so they

---------------

 must satisfy Pick's formula, but the question is only about the ratio n = I/B being an integer. 

Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting

---------------

 us to proceed with the algebra, and the constraints are just that B divides 70 and B ≥3, so the maximum n is 15. 

But the problem mentions that Pat's calculation was too small by 35. Let me check with B=5 and I=75. 

Pat's calculation was A' = B + I/2 -1 =5 +75/2 -1 =5 +37.5 -1=41.5. The actual area is A =75 +5/2 -1=76.5. The difference is 76.5 -41.5 =35, which matches. 

Therefore, the

---------------

 problem is set up so that as long as I - B =70 and n is integer, then such a polygon exists. Therefore

---------------

, the maximum n is 15. 

Wait, but in the example I thought of earlier with B=5 and I=0, that gives a different scenario, but in that case, the problem would not have I - B =70. 

Therefore, if

---------------

 we just take the mathematical constraints given by the problem, which are I - B =70 and n=I/B is integer, then the maximum n is indeed 15, when B=5 and I=75. 

Therefore, maybe the answer is 15. But let me check with

---------------

 another possible B. 

Take B=7, which gives n=(7+70)/7=77/7=11. That's lower. 

Similarly, B=10 gives 80/10=8. So yes, 15 is the maximum. 

But let

---------------

 me check if there are any other divisors of 70 that I missed. 

Divisors of 70: 1,2,5,7,10,14,35,70. 

We excluded 1 and 2 since B must be at least 3. So the next is 5,7, etc. So 5 is the smallest B, leading to the largest n. 

Therefore, unless there is a hidden constraint, 15 is the answer. 

Wait, but in

---------------

 the problem statement, it says "the vertices of a polygon all lie on a rectangular lattice". So maybe the polygon must be a simple polygon (not self-intersecting), but that might not affect the count. 

Alternatively, perhaps the number of boundary points B must be at least the number of edges, but as we saw in the triangle with B=5, that's okay. 

Alternatively, maybe the formula requires that B is at least 3, which we have. 

Therefore, given that the problem doesn

---------------

't specify any further constraints, the answer should be 15. 

Wait, but let me think again. Let me check

---------------

 for B=5, I=75. 

Suppose there exists a polygon with B=5 boundary points and I=75 interior points. The area would be 75 + 5/2 -1 = 76.5. 

Is such a polygon possible? 



---------------

I can imagine a very large polygon with a huge area, so the number of interior points can be large. For example, a polygon that's almost a large rectangle with a small "bite" taken out so that the boundary points remain small. 

Alternatively, think

---------------

 of a polygon that is a convex polygon with a very large area but only 5 boundary points. Wait, but convex polygons with 5 boundary points would have 5 vertices? 

Wait, if it's a convex polygon with 5 vertices, then each edge can't have too many lattice points. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe a polygon that is very "wiggly" but still has only 5 boundary points? Hmm, not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the polygon is a spiral or something, but the

---------------

 key is that the boundary points count all the lattice points on the edges, not just the vertices. 

Wait, but if you have a polygon with only 5 boundary points, that suggests that all edges have minimal lattice points. For instance, edges that are between vertices that are adjacent on the lattice (so gcd(delta_x, delta_y)=1). Except for one edge which has gcd=2? 

Wait, for example, take a polygon with vertices arranged such that most edges have gcd 1, but one edge has gcd 2. 

Wait, let me think of a polygon with B=5. Let me try to create a polygon where B=5. 

Suppose we have a polygon like a "house" shape but with minimal points. 

Alternatively, a

---------------

 polygon with vertices at (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,0), but that's a square with B=4. 

Alternatively, a

---------------

 polygon with vertices (0,0), (2,0), (1,1), (0,1). Let's see:

Edges:

(0,0) to (2,0): gcd(2,0)=2, so contributes 2.

(2,0) to (1,1): gcd(1,1)=1, so contributes 1.

(1,1) to (0,1): gcd(1,0)=1, contributes 1.

(0,1) to (0,0): gcd(0,1)=1, contributes 1.

Total B = 2 +1+1+1=5. 

So that's a quadrilateral with B=5. 

Now, let's compute its area. The coordinates are (0,0), (2,0), (1,1), (0,1). 

Using the shoelace formula:

Order of points: (0,0), (2,0), (1,1), (0,1), back to (0,0).

Compute sum of x_i y_{i+1}:

0*0 + 2*1 +1*1 +0*0 = 0 + 2 +1 +0 =3.

Sum of y_i x_{i+1}:

0*2 +0*1 +1*0 +1*0 =0 +0 +0 +0=0.

Area = |3 -0| /2 =1.5.

Pick's formula: I + B/2 -1. 

We have B=5, area=1.5. So I + 5/2 -1 = I +1.5=1.5 ⇒ I=0.

Thus, again, if

---------------

 we want I=75 and B=5, the area would need to be 76.5, but this example only gives I=0. 

Therefore, to

---------------

 have I=75, the polygon must enclose a huge area with very few boundary points. 

Perhaps a polygon that is a large rectangle with a small hole? Wait, but holes would complicate the lattice points. Alternatively, a polygon that is a very long and thin rectangle with a

---------------

 zig-zag path, but keeping the number of boundary points low. 

Alternatively, maybe a polygon that is almost a square of side length L, but with some edges

---------------

 adjusted so that the total boundary points remain 5? Probably not. 

Alternatively, maybe a polygon that is a large square

---------------

 with most edges aligned along the grid, but with one side indented slightly so that the total boundary points remain 5? 

Alternatively, perhaps it's possible through some complex

---------------

 shape. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is purely mathematical, and existence isn't required? The problem states "using the correct values for I and B", so maybe as long as the values satisfy the equation I - B =70 and n is integer, then it's acceptable, even if constructing such a polygon is non-trivial. 

Given that the problem is from a competition, maybe we are to assume that such a polygon exists as long as the basic

---------------

 conditions (B divides 70, B ≥3, I non-negative) are met. Therefore, the answer is 15. 

Alternatively, perhaps there is an upper bound on n because B must be at least something related to I? For instance, in Pick's theorem, maybe

---------------

 the area must be at least B/2 -1, so I must be at least ... Wait, area = I + B/2 -1, so I = Area - B/2 +1. Since area must be positive, I can be zero or positive. 

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 the problem wants us to consider that B must be greater than or equal to 3, but since we already considered that, and

---------------

 the maximum n is 15. 

Alternatively, maybe there is a mistake in my initial equation. Let me recheck the setup. 

Pat applied Pick's formula with I and B swapped, so Pat computed A' = B + (I)/2 -1. 

The correct area is A = I + (B)/2 -1. 

The problem states that Pat's area was too small by 35, so A - A' =35. 

Therefore:

A - A' = [I + B/2 -1] - [B + I/2 -1] = I - B + (B/2 - I/2) = I - B - (I - B)/2 = (I - B)/2 *2? Wait, perhaps better to recompute:

Let me recompute the difference:

A - A' = (I + B/2 -1) - (B + I/2 -1) = I - B + (B/2 - I/2) = I - B - (I - B)/2 = (2(I - B) - (I - B))/2 = (I - B)/2. 

Wait, that contradicts my previous result. Wait, let me do term by term:

Expand the terms:

I + (B/2) -1 - B - (I/2) +1 = [I - (I/2)] + [(B/2 - B)] + [-1 +1]

So that is (I/2) + (- B/2) + 0 = (I - B)/2. 

So the difference A - A' = (I - B)/2 =35. 

Therefore, (I - B)/2 =35 ⇒ I - B =70. 

Ah! Wait a second! I made a mistake earlier. The difference is (I - B)/2 =35, so I - B=70. Which is what I had before. So that part was correct. 

Therefore, my equations

---------------

 are correct. 

Therefore, the rest follows. 

Hence, since the problem allows for any I and B that satisfy I - B =70 and n=I/B is integer, with B dividing 70 and B≥3, then the maximum n is 15. 

Therefore, I think the answer is 15. 

Wait, but let

---------------

 me confirm once again with the problem's exact wording: "the ratio n = I/B is an integer. Find the greatest possible value of n." So we

---------------

 need to maximize n = I/B, given I - B =70 and B divides 70 (since n = (B +70)/B must be integer). 

Therefore, yes, the maximum is 15. 

Therefore, the answer is 15.

**Final Answer**
Answer: 15


Pat applied Pick’s Formula to find the area of a polygon but mistakenly interchanged the values of \( I \) (interior lattice points) and \( B \) (boundary lattice points). The correct area using Pick’s Formula is \( A = I + \frac{B}{2} - 1 \), while Pat calculated \( A' = B + \frac{I}{2} - 1 \). The problem states that Pat’s result was too small by 35, so we have:

\[
A - A' = 35
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( A \) and \( A' \):

\[
\left( I + \frac{B}{2} - 1 \right) - \left( B + \frac{I}{2} - 1 \right) = 35
\]

Simplifying the left-hand side:

\[
I + \frac{B}{2} - 1 - B - \frac{I}{2} + 1 = \frac{I}{2} - \frac{B}{2} = \frac{I - B}{2}
\]

Thus, we get:

\[
\frac{I - B}{2} = 35 \implies I - B = 70
\]

We need to find the greatest possible value of \( n = \frac{I}{B} \) where \( n \) is an integer. Expressing \( I \) in terms of \( B \):

\[
I = B + 70
\]

Substituting into \( n \):

\[
n = \frac{B + 70}{B} = 1 + \frac{70}{B}
\]

For \( n \) to be an integer, \( \frac{70}{B} \) must be an integer, meaning \( B \) must be a divisor of 70. The divisors of 70 are 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35, and 70. Since \( B \) must be at least 3 (as a polygon must have at least 3 boundary points), the valid divisors are 5, 7, 10, 14, 35, and 70. 

To maximize \( n \), we choose the smallest valid \( B \):

- If \( B = 5 \), then \( n = 1 + \frac{70}{5} = 15 \)
- If \( B = 7 \), then \( n = 1 + \frac{70}{7} = 11 \)
- If \( B = 10 \), then \( n = 1 + \frac{70}{10} = 8 \)
- If \( B = 14 \), then \( n = 1 + \frac{70}{14} = 6 \)
- If \( B = 35 \), then \( n = 1 + \frac{70}{35} = 3 \)
- If \( B = 70 \), then \( n = 1 + \frac{70}{70} = 2 \)

The greatest possible value of \( n \) is 15 when \( B = 5 \).
