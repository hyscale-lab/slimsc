Alright, so I need to solve this problem about finding the minimum possible value of the sum of |y_n - 1| + |y_n + 1| for 24 distinct integer points y_1 to y_{24}. The catch is that for each k from 1 to 12, y_{2k-1} is the reflection of y_{2k} across the point x = 10. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's recall what reflection across a point means. If y_{2k-1} is the reflection of y_{2k} across x = 10, then the midpoint between y_{2k-1} and y_{2k} should be 10. So, mathematically, that would mean (y_{2k-1} + y_{2k}) / 2 = 10. Therefore, y_{2k} = 20 - y_{2k-1}. So each pair (y_{2k-1}, y_{2k}) adds up to 20. That's an important point. So each pair of points must sum to 20, and they are distinct integers. Since all the y's are distinct, that means for each k, y_{2k-1} ≠ y_{2k}, but since they are reflections, they can't be the same unless they are both 10, but since they have to be distinct, they can't both be 10. So each pair is two distinct integers that add to 20.

So, the 24 points are formed by 12 such pairs. Each pair contributes two numbers that add to 20. Since all 24 points must be distinct integers, none of the pairs can overlap with each other. So, for example, if one pair is (a, 20 - a), another pair can't have either a or 20 - a again. So all the pairs must consist of distinct numbers not used in other pairs.

Our goal is to choose these 12 pairs such that when we compute the sum over all 24 points of (|y_n - 1| + |y_n + 1|), this total is minimized.

First, let me think about the expression |y - 1| + |y + 1|. Maybe I can simplify this expression for a general y. Let's see:

The expression |y - 1| + |y + 1|. Let me consider different cases for y.

Case 1: y >= 1. Then |y - 1| = y - 1, and |y + 1| = y + 1. So the sum is (y - 1) + (y + 1) = 2y. So for y >=1, the expression is 2y.

Case 2: -1 <= y < 1. Here, |y - 1| = 1 - y, and |y + 1| = y + 1. So sum is (1 - y) + (y + 1) = 2. So between -1 and 1, the expression is always 2.

Case 3: y < -1. Then |y - 1| = -(y - 1) = -y +1, and |y +1| = -(y +1). So the sum is (-y +1) + (-y -1) = -2y. So for y < -1, the expression is -2y.

So summarizing:

If y <= -1, then the expression is -2y when y < -1, but at y = -1, it's 2. Wait, actually, let's check at y = -1:

At y = -1: | -1 -1 | + | -1 +1 | = | -2 | + | 0 | = 2 + 0 = 2. Similarly, at y = 0: | -1 | + |1| = 1 + 1 = 2. So actually

---------------

, the expression is 2 when -1 <= y <=1, 2y when y >1, and -2y when y < -1.

Therefore, the expression |y -1| + |y +1| is minimized when y is between -1 and 1, where it's always 2, and it increases linearly as you move away from that interval.

Therefore, to minimize the total sum, we want as many of the y_n as possible to be in the interval [-1, 1], because that's where the expression is smallest (2). However, since all the y_n must be integers, the possible values in that interval are -1, 0, 1. But each of these can only be used once because the points have to be distinct. Since there are 24 points, we can have at most three of them in [-1, 1], but since each pair has to sum to 20, we

---------------

 can't have both a number and its complement (since 20 - (-1) =21, which is not in the interval, etc.) So perhaps we need to see how to arrange

---------------

 the pairs so that as many as possible of the points are near -1, 0, 1? But maybe that

---------------

's not possible because of the reflection requirement.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal total sum is achieved when the points are as close as possible to the interval [-1,1], but arranged in pairs that sum to 20. Let me think.

First

---------------

, note that each pair (a, 20 -a) must be two distinct integers. To have their points as close to the interval [-1,1] as possible, perhaps we can have pairs where a is as close to the interval as possible, but their reflections 20 - a would then be on the other side of 10.

Wait, but

---------------

 if we want a pair (a, 20 -a), the distance from a to the interval [-1,1] and the distance from 20 -a to the interval would depend on a. Since

---------------

 reflections are symmetric around 10, so if a is to the left of 10, then 20 -a is to the right of 10. So to minimize the total sum, maybe we can have pairs where one is as close as possible to the interval [-1,1], but then the other would be far away, which might not be helpful. Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't the best.

Alternatively, maybe we can model

---------------

 the total sum over all pairs. Since each pair (a, 20 -a) contributes (|a -1| + |a +1|) + (|20 -a -1| + |20 -a +1|). Let's compute that expression for a pair. Let me denote for a given a:

Term1 = |a -1| + |a +1|

Term2 = |(20 -a) -1| + |(20 -a) +1| = |19 -a| + |21 -a|

So the total for the pair is Term1 + Term2.

Therefore, if I can compute Term1 + Term2 in terms of a, maybe I can find the value of a that minimizes this total for the pair, and then choose such a's to form the pairs, making sure all numbers are distinct.

So let's compute Term1 + Term2 as a function of a.

First, let's note that Term1 + Term2 = (|a -1| + |a +1|) + (|19 -a| + |21 -a|)

Let me consider different ranges for a where the expressions inside the absolute values change their behavior.

The critical points for the absolute value expressions are at a = -1, 1, 19, 21. So we can break down the real line into intervals based on these points:

1. a < -1

2. -1 ≤ a < 1

3. 1 ≤ a < 19

4. 19 ≤ a < 21

5. a ≥ 21

Let me compute Term1 + Term2 in each interval.

Case 1: a < -1

Then:

|a -1| = -(a -1) = -a +1

|a +1| = -(a +1)

So Term1 = (-a +1) + (-a -1) = -2a

Similarly,

|19 -a|: Since a < -1 <19, so 19 -a is positive, so |19 -a| = 19 -a

|21 -a|: Similarly, 21 -a is positive, so |21 -a| = 21 -a

Thus, Term2 = (19 -a) + (21 -a) = 40 - 2a

Total for the pair: (-2a) + (40 - 2a) = 40 -4a

Since a < -1, so -4a is positive, so the total is 40 -4a, which is greater than 40 -4*(-1) = 44? Wait, actually, when a is more negative, -4a becomes larger, so the total increases as a decreases. So the minimum in this interval would be when a approaches -infinity? But since a has to be integer, but we can't go too far because we need to pair with 20 -a. Wait, but actually

---------------

, the problem is that a has to be part of a pair, so 20 -a must also be an integer. But we can choose a as any integer except those already used, but perhaps

---------------

 the minimal total here is when a is as large as possible in this interval, i.e., approaching -1 from the left. So at a = -2, for example:

At a = -2,

Total would be 40 -4*(-2) = 40 +8 =48.

Wait, but let me check:

Term1 for a=-2: | -2 -1 | + | -2 +1 | = 3 +1 =4

Term2 for a=-2 (so 20 -a =22):

|22 -1| + |22 +1| =21 +23=44, so total 4 +44=48. Correct. So for

---------------

 a=-2, the pair contributes 48.

Case 2: -1 ≤ a <1

Here, Term1 is 2, as we saw before. Because

---------------

 for a between -1 and 1, the first expression is 2. So Term1 =2.

Term2 is still |19 -a| + |21 -a|. Since a is between -1 and1, so 19 -a is between 18 and 20, so positive, and 21 -a is between 20 and22, also positive. Thus,

Term2 = (19 -a) + (21 -a) = 40 - 2a

Thus, the total is 2 + (40 - 2a) =42 - 2a

Since a is between -1 and1, so when a is at its maximum (a approaching 1 from below), the total is 42 -2*(1) =40, and when a is at its minimum (a approaching -1 from above), the total is 42 -2*(-1)=44. So the minimal total in this interval is 40 (approaching a=1). However, since a must be integer, in this interval, the possible integer a's are 0 and -0? Wait, integers between -1 and1 are 0 and -1? Wait, since

---------------

 the interval is -1 ≤a <1, so integers are -1, 0. Wait, but when a is exactly -1 or 0 or 1?

Wait, let

---------------

 me clarify:

The interval is -1 ≤ a <1, so integers in this interval are -1, 0. Because 1 is excluded.

Wait, but a

---------------

 can be exactly -1, but in that case, since a is in the interval, so:

If a is exactly -1, then since -1 is included in this interval, so:

At a = -1,

Term1 = | -1 -1 | + | -1 +1 | = 2 +0 =2 (matches

---------------

 the interval's term1=2).

Term2 would be |19 - (-1)| + |21 - (-1)| = |20| + |22| =20 +22=42. So total is 2 +42=44.

At a =0,

Term1 =2,

Term2 = |19 -0| + |21 -0| =19 +21=40, so total 2+40=42.

At a approaching 1 from below (but a must be integer, so a=0 is the closest). So the minimal in this interval is 42 when a=0. However, a=1 is not included here, but in the next interval.

Case 3: 1 ≤ a <19

Here, Term1 = |a -1| + |a +1|. Since a ≥1, |a -1|=a -1, and |a +1|=a +1. Thus Term1 = (a -1) + (a +1)=2a.

Term2 = |19 -a| + |21 -a|. Since a is between 1 and19, 19 -a is non-negative (since a <19), and 21 -a is positive (since a <19 <21). So:

Term2 = (19 -a) + (21 -a) = 40 -2a.

Therefore, total for the pair is 2a + (40 -2a) =40. So this is constant 40 for all a in this interval. Interesting! So for any a between 1 and 19 (not including 19), the total contribution of the pair is 40. That's a key point.

Case4: 19 ≤ a <21

Here, Term1 is 2a (since a ≥1, so same as previous case).

---------------

 But let's check:

Wait, a is between 19 and21, so a is still greater than 1, so Term1 is still 2a. 

Term2: |19 -a| + |21 -a|. Since 19 ≤a <21,

|19 -a| = a -19,

|21 -a| =21 -a,

Thus Term2 = (a -19) + (21 -a) =2.

Therefore, the total for the pair is 2a +2.

Since a is between 19 and21 (but a is integer, so 19 or20):

At a=19,

Total is 2*19 +2=38 +2=40.

At a=20,

Total is 2*20 +2=40 +2=42.

Wait, but a=20 is included in this interval (since 19 ≤a <21). But 20 is allowed. Wait, but a=20 would pair with 20 -a =0, right? Because the pair is (a,20 -a). So if a=20, then 20 -20=0. But 0 is already considered in case2. Hmm, but need

---------------

 to ensure that all pairs are distinct.

But let's see for the total:

At a=19,

Total contribution is 2*19 +2 =40, same as the previous interval.

At a=20,

Total contribution is 42.

So in this interval, the minimal contribution is 40 at a=19.

Case5: a ≥21

Then Term1 is |a -1| + |a +1|. Since a ≥21, both terms are positive, so Term1 = (a -1)+(a +1)=2a.

Term2 = |19 -a| + |21 -a|. Since a ≥21,

|19 -a|=a -19,

|21 -a|=a -21,

Thus Term2 = (a -19) + (a -21)=2a -40.

Thus total is 2a + (2a -40)=4a -40.

Since a ≥21, this is 4*21 -40=84-40=44 when a=21, and increases as a increases. So the minimal here is 44 at a=21.

So summarizing all cases:

- For a < -1: total is 40 -4a, which is minimized when a is as large as possible (closest to -1), so at a=-2 gives 48, but actually

---------------

 the minimal in this interval is when a approaches -1 from left, but a must be integer. So a=-2 gives 48, which is higher than other intervals.

- For -1 ≤a <1 (integers -1,0): the total is 42 (at a=0) or 44 (at a=-1). The minimal here is 42.

- For 1 ≤a <19 (integers 1 through 18): total is always 40.

- For 19 ≤a <21 (integers 19,20): total is 40 (at a=19) or 42 (at a=20).

- For a ≥21 (a=21,22,...): total is 4a-40, starting at 44 when a=21.

Therefore, the minimal total contribution per pair is 40, which occurs when a is in [1,19], excluding 19? Wait, no, even at a=19, the total is still 40. Wait in case4, at a=19, it's 40, so actually from a=1 to a=19 inclusive, the total is 40. Because:

Wait for a=19, which is in case4, the total is 40. So actually, the interval 1 ≤a ≤19 (since a=19 is allowed here). So the

---------------

 minimal contribution per pair is 40, achieved for a from 1 to19 inclusive.

Therefore, to get the minimal total sum, we want as many pairs as possible to have their a in the range 1 to19 so that each contributes 40. However, since we have 12 pairs, each contributing 40 would give a total of 12*40=480. But we need to check if this is possible, given the constraints of distinct integers.

Wait, but each pair (a,20 -a) must consist of distinct integers, and all 24 points must be distinct. So we need to select 12 distinct pairs (a_i, 20 -a_i) such that all a_i and 20 -a_i are distinct integers. Since each pair (a,20 -a) are distinct as long as a ≠10, which they are because a is between 1 and19 (so 20 -a would be between 1 and19 as well? Wait, no:

Wait if a is between 1 and19, then 20 -a is between 1 and19 as well? Let's see:

If a is 1, then 20 -a =19.

If a is 2, then 20 -a=18, etc., up to a=10, which would give 20 -10=10, but since a must be different from 20 -a (they have to be distinct points), so a cannot be 10. Therefore, the pairs (

---------------

a,20 -a) for a from 1 to19, excluding 10, would give pairs where each pair sums to 20 and the two elements are distinct. However, note

---------------

 that when a is from 1 to9, the pairs are (1,19), (2,18), ..., (9,11). Then (10,10) is invalid, so we can't use a=10. Then from a=11 to19, those would pair with 9 down to1, so those are the same pairs as before. So actually, there are 9 pairs from 1-9 and their counterparts 19-11. Then to

---------------

 get 12 pairs, we need 3 more pairs. 

Wait, so if we use a from 1 to19 (excluding 10), that gives us 19 -1 =18 numbers, but paired as 9 pairs. So 9 pairs. To get 12 pairs, we need 3 more pairs. So

---------------

 we have to go outside the 1-19 range for the remaining pairs, which would mean that their contribution would be higher than 40.

Alternatively, maybe we can include a=0 and a=20, but let's see.

Wait, the pairs can

---------------

 include numbers outside 1 to19 as long as they are reflections around 10, but their total contribution would be higher. For example, if we take a=0, then the pair is (0,20). The total contribution would be 42 (as computed earlier for a=0). Similarly, a=20 gives (20,0), same as above. Similarly, a=-1 gives (-1,21), which contributes 44, etc.

Therefore, if we use 9 pairs within 1-19 (each contributing 40) and 3 more pairs outside, which

---------------

 would contribute more. Let's see what's the minimal total.

Suppose we need 12 pairs. The first 9 pairs can be (1,19), (2,18), ..., (9,11) each contributing 40. Then we need 3 more pairs. To minimize the total, we should choose the next best possible pairs, which would be those contributing the least. The next best contributions

---------------

 are 40 (if possible), but since we have already used all a from1 to19 except 10. Wait, 10 can't be used because it

---------------

 would pair with itself. So the remaining numbers outside 1-19 would have to be used. So the next best is a=0 and 20, which gives a total of 42 per pair. Similarly, a= -1 and 21 would give 44, which is worse.

Therefore, to get the minimal total, we should take the next pairs as (0,20), (20,0) but wait, but they are the same pair. Since we need distinct points. Wait, the pair (0,20) is one pair. Similarly, if

---------------

 we take a=0, then the pair is (0,20). Then another pair could be ( -1,21), but that's 44, but perhaps there are other options?

Wait, let

---------------

's see: To get three more pairs beyond the 9 pairs in the 1-19 range, we have to pick pairs outside. The minimal contribution per pair beyond the 40 is 42 (for a=0 or a=20) or 44 (for a=-1 or 21) or higher. So to minimize the total, we need to use as many as possible of the pairs contributing 42, then 44, etc.

So the minimal

---------------

 would be to have three pairs each contributing 42, so adding 3*42 = 126, plus

---------------

 the 9*40=360, total 360+126=486.

Alternatively, can we find other pairs that contribute 40? Let me check if there are other a's that can give 40?

Wait, for a=19, the pair is (19,1). Wait, but (19,1) is already included in the first set as (1,19). So we

---------------

 can't use it again. Similarly, a=20 would pair with 0, which is a new pair.

Alternatively, is there another a outside 1-19 that can give a total of 40?

Looking back at the cases:

In

---------------

 case3, the total was 40 for a between 1 and19. So to get 40, the a must be in that interval. Therefore, the

---------------

 only way to get 40 is to have the pair within 1-19. So no other pairs outside can contribute 40. Hence, the minimal beyond

---------------

 that is 42. So if we have to take 3 more pairs, each contributing 42, then the total would be 9*40 + 3*42 = 360 +126=486.

Wait, but can we use a=10? But a=10 would pair with itself, but they have to be distinct, so that's invalid. So no. Alternatively, are there other pairs?

Wait, maybe using

---------------

 a=20 and 0, that's one pair. Then, can we have a= -0? No, same as 0. Alternatively, maybe using a= 21 and -1? That would be another pair contributing 44. Hmm

---------------

.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way to choose the pairs so that some pairs outside 1-19 can be arranged to have lower contributions? Wait, let me see.

Wait, for

---------------

 example, if a=10 is excluded, but maybe some other a's?

Wait, perhaps I made an error in considering the pairs. Let me think again.

The problem states that all 24 points must be distinct integers. So when choosing pairs (a,20 -a), each of these must not have been used in another pair.

So, if we take the first 9 pairs as (1,19), (2,18), ..., (9,11), that uses up the numbers 1 through19 except 10, but actually, each pair uses two numbers, so total numbers used in these 9 pairs are 1,2,...,9 and 11,...,19. So numbers from 1-9 and 11-19, which is 18 numbers, leaving out 10,0, -1, -2,... and 20,21, etc.

Thus, to get the remaining 6 numbers (since 24 total, 18 already used), we need three more pairs. The minimal contribution would be to take the next closest pairs to the 1-19 range.

The closest numbers

---------------

 are 0 and20. So pair (0,20) contributing 42. Then next would be (-1,21), which contributes 44. Then maybe

---------------

 ( -2,22) contributing 48, but that's worse. Alternatively, maybe (21, -1) is same as (-1,21). So if

---------------

 we take three pairs: (0,20), (-1,21), and ( -2,22), then their contributions are 42,44,48. Total would be 42+44+48=134, leading to total sum 9*40 + 134= 360 +134=494.

Alternatively, maybe there are other pairs with lower contributions? Let me see:

Suppose instead of going to negative numbers, can we go higher? For example, a=20 pairs with 0, which we already considered. a=21 pairs with -1, which is 44. a=22 pairs with -2, 48. a=23 pairs with -3, which would be 52, etc. So they

---------------

 get worse as we go further.

Alternatively, can we use a= 10? But 10 pairs with itself, which is invalid. So no.

Alternatively, can

---------------

 we use a= 19.5? No, because they have to be integers.

Alternatively, is there a way to have some overlapping pairs? No, all points must be distinct.

Alternatively, perhaps instead

---------------

 of taking the first 9 pairs as 1-9 and their counterparts, maybe we can shift some pairs to include 0 and 20 in the 40 contribution? Wait, but 0 and20 can't be part of a pair that contributes 40 because they are outside the 1-19 range.

Wait, but let me think differently. Suppose we don't take all the pairs from 1-19 first, but instead, leave some of them to pair with others to get lower total?

Wait, for example, if we can have a pair that includes 0 and 20, which gives 42, but maybe another pair that can

---------------

 also give 42. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps some of the pairs in the 1-19 range can be "

---------------

sacrificed" to allow more low-contribution pairs? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal total is indeed 486, but let's check.

Wait, let me recast the problem:

We need 12 pairs (each pair (a,20 -a)), all 24 numbers distinct integers. The total sum is sum over all pairs of (Term1 + Term2) for each pair. Each

---------------

 pair's contribution is either:

- 40 if a is between 1 and19 (excluding 10, but pairs

---------------

 are already accounted for as long as distinct),

- 42 if a is 0 or20,

- 44 if a is -1 or21,

- 48 if a is -2 or22,

and so on.

So, to minimize the total sum, we need as many pairs as possible with contribution 40, then as many as possible with 42, etc.

The maximum number of pairs contributing 40 is 9 (since numbers 1-19 excluding10 gives 18 numbers, which is 9 pairs). The remaining 3 pairs must be outside. The minimal contribution for those 3 pairs is to take the next smallest contributions, which are 42 each. However, can we actually get three pairs each contributing 42?

The pairs that contribute 42 are (0,20) and (20,0) but that's the same pair, so only one pair can be (0,20). Then the next would be (a=20, but already used. Then next is a=-1 and21, which is 44, and a=21 and -1, same pair. Then next is a= -2 and22 (48). Hmm, so actually, the next available pairs after the 9 pairs are (0,20) [42], (-1,21)[44], (-2,22)[48], (1,19) already used, etc. So we

---------------

 can only get one pair at 42, then the next two pairs have to be 44 and48. That would give total contributions for the remaining three pairs as 42+44+48=134, leading to total sum 9*40 +134= 360+134=494.

Wait, but maybe there are other pairs with lower contributions? Let me see:

Wait, if

---------------

 I take a=10 is invalid. What about a=20, which gives (20,0), which is the same as (0,20). So only one pair with contribution 42. Then, perhaps

---------------

 another pair using a= something else?

Wait, maybe instead of taking the first 9 pairs as 1-9 and 19-11, perhaps we can exclude

---------------

 some pairs in the middle to include 0 and20?

For example, if we take the pair (0,20) instead of one of the pairs in the 1-19 range, then we can have an extra pair contributing

---------------

 42 instead of 40, but that would actually increase the total. So that's worse.

Alternatively, perhaps there

---------------

's a way to have more pairs contributing 42?

Wait, the only way to get a contribution of 42 is pairs

---------------

 (0,20) or (20,0) which is same, so only one such pair. Similarly, (

---------------

a=20) and (a=0) are same pair. So only one pair can have 42. Similarly, if

---------------

 you take a= -0, but that's same as 0. So no.

Alternatively, maybe there is another a where the contribution is 42? Let me see:

Looking back at the cases

---------------

:

In case2, when a=0, gives 42. In case5, when a=20, but a=20 is in case5, which gives 4a-40, so when a=20, 4*20-40=40? Wait wait, hold on, in case5, a >=21, so a=20 is actually in case4.

Wait, let

---------------

 me recheck the case breakdown:

Case4 was 19 ≤a <21. So a=19 and20. So a=20 is in case4. Then in case4, when a=20, the total contribution is 2a +2. So 2*20 +2=42. So that

---------------

's correct. So (a=20, pair is (20,0)), so that is in case4, which allows a=20. So that is indeed

---------------

 a contribution of 42. So the pair (20,0) is in case4.

Similarly, the pair (-1,21): a=-1 is in case2, so contribution

---------------

 was 44. Wait, but a=-1 in case2 gives Term1 + Term2=44, yes. So (a=-1,21) gives 44.

So, the pairs contributing 42 are only (0,20). Then, the next possible is (21, -1) at 44, then (22,-2) at48, etc.

Therefore, for

---------------

 the remaining three pairs beyond the 9 pairs in 1-19, we can only get one pair at42, one at44, and one at48, totaling 134, leading to 494.

Wait, but maybe there are other pairs with

---------------

 a in other regions that can give lower?

Wait, let me see: if I take a=10, but that's invalid. What about a=19.5? Not integer.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 instead of taking the 9 pairs from 1-9 and 11-19, maybe take some pairs that include 0 and20 but still stay within 1-19? No, 0 and20 are outside that range.

Alternatively, is there a way to have more

---------------

 than one pair with contribution 42? Let me see. Suppose we don't use 0 and20 in the first 9 pairs? Wait, they are not in 1-19, so they are not part of the first 9 pairs. So the only way to get 42 is to

---------------

 have the pair (0,20). So only one such pair.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe there is a different way to arrange the pairs so that more pairs can be in the 40 contribution?

Wait, suppose

---------------

 instead of taking all the pairs from 1-9 and 11-19, which are 9 pairs, maybe we can take

---------------

 some pairs that include numbers beyond 19 but still have their counterparts within the range so that they can contribute 40?

Wait, for example, if we take a=19, which is allowed, and

---------------

 pairs with 1. That's already counted in the first 9. Alternatively, a=20 pairs with0, which is outside. So no. So actually, all pairs with a from1 to19 (excluding10) must pair with their counterparts within 1 to19. So the

---------------

 first 9 pairs are indeed the maximum number of pairs that can contribute 40.

Thus, the minimal total would be 9*40 +1*42 +1*44 +1*48= 360 +42+44+48= 360+134=494.

But wait, is

---------------

 there a way to have two pairs contributing 42?

Wait, perhaps if I take the pair (0,20) and (20,0) but that is the same pair. So only one pair can be (0,20). So no.

Alternatively, perhaps another

---------------

 pair with a different a that also gives 42? Let me see:

Wait, let me re-examine the case for a=20. If a=20, then the pair is (20,0). The contribution is 42. Similarly, if a=0, the pair is (0,20), same as before. So only one pair here.

Alternatively, is there another a where the contribution is 42?

Looking at the case for a=19, which is in case4:

At a=19, contribution is 40. So that's already

---------------

 part of the 9 pairs.

Wait, a=10 is invalid. Hmm.

Alternatively, let me check if there is a miscalculation in my earlier analysis.

Wait, in

---------------

 case4, when a is between19 and21, for a=19, contribution is 40. For a=20, it's 42, and a=21 would be in case5, giving 44? Wait, a

---------------

=21 is in case5 (a≥21), so contribution is 4a-40. So 4*21-40=84-40=44. So yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the only pairs that can contribute less than 44 are:

- The 9 pairs in 1-19 (excluding 10) contributing 40 each,

- The pair (0,20) contributing42,

- The next is ( -1,21) contributing44,

- Then ( -2,22) contributing48,

But we need three more pairs beyond the 9. So first

---------------

 is (0,20)=42, second (-1,21)=44, third (-2,22)=48. Total extra 134, so total sum 494.

Alternatively, can we choose different pairs to

---------------

 get lower total?

Suppose instead of taking (-2,22)=48, we take (2,18) but that's already used in the first 9 pairs. So no.

Alternatively, is

---------------

 there another pair that can contribute 44?

Yes, for example, the pair (a=21, -1) is one pair contributing44. Similarly

---------------

, (a= -1,21). So that's one pair. Then, is there another pair that can contribute44? Let's see:

If a=21, which

---------------

 pairs with -1, giving44. If a= -2, pairs with22, which is48. a=2, already used. a=22 would pair with-2, which is48. a= -3 pairs with23 (52), etc. So the next after44 is48. So no

---------------

, there's only one pair at44, then the next is48.

Alternatively, maybe using a=1 and19? But those are already in the first set.

Alternatively, perhaps instead

---------------

 of taking the pair (0,20), we can take another pair which allows another pair with lower contribution? Not sure.

Alternatively, is there a different arrangement where some pairs are

---------------

 arranged to have lower total?

Suppose instead of taking the first 9 pairs as (1,19) up to (9,11), maybe we can exclude one of those pairs to include two pairs with lower total?

Wait, for example, if we exclude the pair (1,19) which contributes40, then we can have two other pairs: (0,20) and (-1,21). Then their total would be42+44=86, compared to the original40. So that would actually be worse (86 vs40). So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe exclude two pairs contributing40 to get three pairs contributing lower? Wait

---------------

, but the other pairs outside contribute more than40, so that would be worse.

Hmm, so it seems unavoidable that the minimal total is 494. But let me check another approach.

Alternatively, what if we arrange

---------------

 the pairs so that some of the pairs are symmetric around 10 but include numbers closer to -1,0,1, where the expression |y -1| + |y +1| is minimized (i.e., equals2). However, since each pair must sum to20, if one element is near -1, the other is near21, which is far from the interval [-1,1], so the total contribution might not be better.

For example, let's take the pair (-1,21). Their contributions would be:

For -1: | -1 -1| + | -1 +1| =2 +0=2,

For21: |21 -1| + |21 +1|=20+22=42,

Total for pair:2+42=44.

Alternatively, if we take the pair (0,20):

0 contributes2, 20 contributes |20-1| + |20+1|=19+21=40,

Total:2+40=42.

Similarly, pair (1,19):

1: |1-1| + |1+1|=0 +2=2,

19: |19-1| + |19+1|=18+20=38,

Total:2+38=40.

Ah! Wait a second, I

---------------

 think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate the contribution for each pair.

Wait, earlier I considered for a pair (a, 20 -a), the total is Term1(a) + Term2(a). But actually, the total contribution for the pair is (Term1(a) + Term1(20 -a)). Wait, no

---------------

, actually, each pair has two elements: a and 20 -a. So for each pair, the total contribution is [ |a -1| + |a +1| ] + [ |(20 -a) -1| + |(20 -a) +1| ].

Which is exactly what I computed before as Term1(a) + Term2(a). So the previous analysis holds. But when I broke

---------------

 it down for specific examples like (1,19):

The total contribution was 2 +38=40, which matches the previous calculation (for a=1, which is in case3, giving

---------------

 total40). Similarly, (0,20) gives 2 +40=42, which is correct. So the previous analysis is correct.

However, here

---------------

's an idea: If I can have as many points as possible in the interval [-1,1], since their contribution is 2 each. Each such point can be paired with another point (

---------------

20 - y), but if y is in [-1,1], then 20 - y is between19 and21. So for each y in [-1,1], the other point is in [19,21], contributing a higher amount.

So to have a point y in [-1,1], you have to pair it with 20 - y in [19,21]. So

---------------

 for each such y, the pair contributes 2 + (contribution of 20 - y). For example, if y=0, the pair contributes 2 +40=42 (as before). If y=1, the pair contributes2 +38=40. If y=-1, the pair contributes2 + (contribution of21)=2 + (|21-1|+|21+1|)=2 +42=44. Wait, but 

---------------

21's contribution is |21 -1| + |21+1|=20+22=42, so total pair is 2 +42=44, yes.

Therefore, to have a point in [-1,1], you have to take the hit of their partner's contribution. The minimal contribution for such a pair is when y=1, giving total40. Because

---------------

 y=1 pairs with19, which contributes38, so total40. Similarly, y=0 pairs with20, contributing40, total42. y=-1 pairs with21, contributing42, total44.

Therefore, the best among these is to have y=1 paired with19 (total40). So that

---------------

's already accounted for in our initial 9 pairs (since (1,19) is part of the first 9 pairs contributing40). So that

---------------

 pair is already in the optimal set.

Therefore, the points y=1 and19 are already included in the first9 pairs. Similarly, y=0 would require pairing with20, which adds42. So to minimize the total, it's better to include as many pairs from the first9 as possible (since they give40 each), and only use the pairs involving [-1,0,1] when necessary.

Since

---------------

 we have to have 24 distinct points, and the first9 pairs use up numbers1-9 and11-19 (18 numbers), we need 6 more numbers, which must be 0, -1, -2,... and20,21, etc. To minimize the total, we need to choose the minimal

---------------

 contributions for those 6 numbers.

The minimal contributions for the remaining numbers would be:

The next closest pairs are (0,20) contributing42,

(-1,21) contributing44,

and then (-2,22) contributing48,

but since we need three more pairs (6 numbers), those three pairs are necessary.

Thus, the total would indeed be 9*40 + 42 +44 +48 = 494.

Wait, but let me confirm with

---------------

 an explicit example.

Suppose we have the first 9 pairs as:

(1,19), (2,18), (3,17), (4,16), (5,15), (6,14), (7,13), (8,12), (9,11). These contribute 9*40=360.

Then the remaining three pairs:

(0,20): contributes42,

(-1,21): contributes44,

(-2,22): contributes48.

Total extra:42+44+48=134,

Total sum: 360+134=494.

Alternatively, could we choose different pairs for the last three to get a lower total?

Suppose instead of taking (-2,22), which is48, we take another pair like (23,-3), which would contribute even more (52). So that's worse.

Alternatively, is there a pair that uses a number between1-19 not already used? All numbers from1-19 except10 are already used. So no.

Alternatively, can

---------------

 we use a=10? No, since it pairs with itself.

Alternatively, use a=20 with0, which we did.

Alternatively, is

---------------

 there a way to have two pairs with contribution42? Like (0,20) and (20,0) but that's the same pair.

Alternatively, can

---------------

 we have another a where the contribution is42? For example, a=20 gives42, but that's the same pair.

Alternatively, a= -0? No, same as0.

Hmm, so I don't think so. Therefore, 494 might be the minimal.

Wait, but let's think again. The problem states that the 24 points must be distinct integers. So when

---------------

 I have the pair (0,20), those numbers are new. Similarly, (-1,21), (-2,22) are new. So all 24 points are distinct.

Alternatively, maybe there's another set of pairs that can be arranged to have lower total.

Suppose instead of taking ( -2,22), can we take a pair like (10,10)? No, since they must be distinct.

Alternatively, what

---------------

 if we rearrange some of the first pairs to free up numbers?

Suppose we remove one pair from the first9 pairs, say (9,11), and instead use those numbers in another pair to get a better total. Let's see:

If we remove (9,11), which contributes40, and instead use 9 and11 in other pairs. For example, pair9 with something else, but they have to be reflections. So 9 must pair with20 -9=11, which is the original pair. So can't change that.

Alternatively, perhaps not

---------------

 take (1,19) but instead use1 in another pair? But1 has to pair with19. So no.

Alternatively, is there a different pairing strategy?

Wait, what if we don

---------------

't take the first9 pairs but instead take some other pairs that might allow us to have more low contributions?

Suppose instead of taking pairs from1-9 and11-19, we take some pairs that include0 and20 but still get most pairs at40.

Wait, let's see: suppose we take the pair (0,20) contributing42. Then we can still take pairs from1-19 excluding0 and20. Wait, but0 and20 are outside that range.

Wait, the

---------------

 numbers from1-19 excluding10 give18 numbers, which is9 pairs. If we use one of those numbers in another pair with0 or20, we lose a pair that would have contributed40 and instead get a pair contributing42 but also have to deal

---------------

 with another pair.

For example, suppose we take the pair (0,20) instead of the pair (1,19). Then we lose the40 contribution and gain42, so net loss of2. But then we still need to use1 and19 in another pair? But they have to be paired with their reflections.1 must pair with19, so they have to be together. So you can't separate them. So if you don't pair them, you can't use either of them in another pair without breaking the reflection rule.

Therefore, it

---------------

's impossible to "free up" numbers from the first9 pairs without losing their contribution.

Hence, the minimal total is indeed 494.

Wait, but let me check one more thing. The problem says "24 distinct integer points y_1,…,y_{24}". So all the numbers must be distinct integers. In the arrangement I suggested, all numbers from1-19 (except10),0,-1,-2,20,21,22 are used. That's 18 +4 +4=26? Wait no, let's count:

First9 pairs use numbers1-9 and11-19: that's9+9=18 numbers.

Then three more pairs: (0,20), (-1,21), (-2,22). These add0,20,-1,21,-2,22: 6 new numbers. Total numbers:18+6=24. Correct.

All distinct. So that's valid.

Is there a different set of three pairs beyond the first9 that can give a lower total?

Suppose instead of taking (-2,22)=48, can we take (a=2,18) but they are already used. No.

Alternatively, pair

---------------

 (-3,23) contributing | -3 -1| + |-3 +1| + |23 -1| + |23 +1| = (4 + 2) + (22 +24)=6+46=52. Worse.

Alternatively, ( -1,21)=44, (0,20)=42, and ( maybe

---------------

 (3,17) but that's already used. No.

Alternatively, perhaps a different combination: (0,20)=42, (1,19)=40, but (1,19) is already in the first9 pairs. So can't reuse.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 taking one of the pairs from the first9 and combining it with others? Doesn't seem possible.

Therefore, I think the minimal total is 494.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me rec

---------------

alculate the total for the three additional pairs:

(0,20): contribution is |0-1|+|0+1| + |20-1|+|20+1| = (1+1)+(19+21)=2+40=42.

(-1,21): | -1-1| + | -1+1| + |21-1| + |21+1| = (2+0)+(20+22)=2+42=44.

(-2,22): | -2-1| + |-2+1| + |22-1| + |22+1| = (3 +1)+(21+23)=4+44=48.

Yes, so those are correct. So 42+44+48=134. 9*40=360. 360+134=494.

But hold on, the problem says "24 distinct integer points". The

---------------

 points include all the numbers from the pairs. Let me verify that all numbers are distinct.

First9 pairs: 1-9 and11-19 (excluding10). So numbers:1,2,...,9,11,12,...,19. That's 18 numbers.

Then the three additional pairs:

0,20; -1,21; -2,22.

These are 0,20,-1,21,-2,22. None of these are in the first set except maybe 20 and21,22 which are outside 1-19 except20 is outside. So yes, all distinct. 18+6=24. Perfect.

Therefore, the minimal total is 494. But wait, let me check once more if there's a smarter combination.

Suppose instead of taking the pair (-2,22), can I take another pair that uses a number already in the first set but that's not possible because all first set numbers are already paired.

Alternatively, is

---------------

 there a different way to choose the first9 pairs to allow a better combination?

Wait, the first9 pairs are forced to be the 9 pairs from1-9 and11-19. There's no other way to choose 9 pairs within1-19 without overlapping. So that's optimal.

Alternatively, perhaps using

---------------

 a different reflection point? Wait, no, the reflection is fixed aroundx=10.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I

---------------

 made a mistake in calculating the contribution for a pair like (a=1,19). Let me recalculate that:

For a=1:

Term1 = |1 -1| + |1 +1| =0 +2=2,

Term2 (for20 -1=19):

|19-1| + |19+1| =18+20=38,

Total contribution:2+38=40. Correct.

Similarly, for a=9:

|9-1| + |9+1|=8+10=18,

Term2 for20-9=11:

|11-1| + |11+1|=10+12=22,

Total:18+22=40. Correct.

So all those pairs contribute40. So that's solid.

Hmm. So

---------------

 I think 494 is correct, but the problem says "the minimum possible value". Wait, but maybe there's a different configuration where some pairs can have lower contributions?

Wait, another idea: What if some pairs are arranged such that both elements are in [-1,1]?

But for two numbers to be reflections across10 and both be in [-1,1], their midpoint must be10. So (y1 + y2)/2=10, so y1 + y2=20. But if both y1 and y2 are between-1 and1, their sum can be at most1+1=2, which is way less than20. So impossible. So no such pairs can exist. Thus, any pair must have one element significantly

---------------

 larger than10 and the other smaller, but not both in the low interval.

Therefore, the minimal total is indeed 494. But wait, let me check the

---------------

 problem statement again:

"24 distinct integer points y_1, y_2, …, y_{24} on the number line such that for all k where 1 ≤k ≤12, we have y_{2k-1} is the reflection of y_{2k} across x."

So each pair (y_{2k-1}, y_{2k}) must be reflections. So each pair must sum to20. So yes, our

---------------

 approach is correct.

Wait, but maybe there is a different pairing where some pairs have a contribution less than40?

Wait, in case3, when a is between1 and19, the contribution is40. So no pair can have less than40 unless a is in other regions where the total is less than40. Looking back:

In case2 (a between-1 and1), the total is42 -2a. The minimal in that interval is40 when a approaches1 from below (a=1 gives40? Wait a=1 is in case3. Wait when a=1, it's in case3 (1≤a<19), so contribution is40. So actually, at a=1, it's in case3. So the minimal contribution per pair is indeed40, and you can't get lower than that. So 40 is the minimal per pair possible.

Therefore, with 12 pairs, the theoretical minimum would be12×40=480, but since we can only have9 pairs at40, the rest have to be higher, so 494 is the minimal.

Wait, but hold

---------------

 on, the problem says "24 distinct integer points". So perhaps there's a way to have more than9 pairs in the 40 contribution?

Wait, how many pairs can we have with a between1 and19 (excluding10)?

Numbers from1 to19 excluding10: that's18 numbers, which make9 pairs. So that's the maximum. So no, can't have more.

Therefore, I think the minimal total is494. But I have a doubt because maybe I missed a configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps using

---------------

 a=10 in some way, but since it can't pair with itself, no.

Alternatively, using non-integer points? No, the points must be integers.

Hmm.

Wait, let me try to compute for another configuration where instead of going to -2,22, maybe take

---------------

 another pair that gives a lower contribution?

Suppose instead of taking (-2,22), take (23,-3). But that would give even higher contribution.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 (a= -3,23), contribution would be:

For a=-3,

Term1= |-3-1| + |-3+1| =4 +2=6,

Term2 for23:

|23-1| + |23+1|=22+24=46,

Total:6+46=52. Worse.

Alternatively, (

---------------

a= -4,24), contribution60? Even worse.

Hmm. So no improvement there.

Alternatively, what about a=10.5? Not integer.

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 using a=19.5? No.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal is actually 480 + 14=494? Wait, but why

---------------

 14? No, it's 9×40 + three pairs:42+44+48=134. 9×40=360, 360+134=494.

Alternatively, let me think differently.

The total sum over all pairs is sum_{n=1}^{24} (|y_n -1| + |y_n +1|). Since each pair (a,20 -a) contributes (|a-1| + |a+1|) + (|19 -a| + |21 -a|).

So maybe

---------------

 there's a way to write the total sum as a function over all a_i where the pairs are (a_i,20 -a_i), and then find the minimal sum over all possible such pairings.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for each pair (a,20 -a), the total contribution is f(a) where f(a) is:

As before

---------------

:

If a is between1 and19 (excluding10), f(a)=40,

If a=0 or20, f(a)=42,

a=-1 or21: f(a)=44,

a=-2 or22: f(a)=48,

and so on.

Therefore, to minimize the total sum, we need as many as possible of the f(a_i)=40, then 42, etc.

Thus, with 12 pairs, the minimal is 9×40 +3×42= 360+126=486? Wait, but how?

Wait, if I can have three pairs at42 instead of one at42, one at44, one at48.

Wait, but how? The only way to get42 is with

---------------

 a=0 or20. So only one pair can be42. The next is44 with a=-1 or21. So two pairs can give42 and44?

Wait no, only

---------------

 one pair can be (0,20). The next is (-1,21)=44. The third is (-2,22)=48. So three

---------------

 pairs give 42+44+48=134.

Alternatively, can I have another pair that gives42? For instance, using a different a?

Wait, a=20 gives42, but that's the same pair. So no.

Alternatively, a

---------------

= something else?

Wait, if a= 10, but that's invalid.

Hmm.

Wait a different approach: Let me compute

---------------

 the total sum for the configuration I considered:

First9 pairs (1-9 and11-19):

Each contributes40, so 9×40=360.

The three additional pairs:

(0,20):42,

(-1,21):44,

(-2,22):48,

Total extra:134,

Total:360+134=494.

Alternatively, suppose

---------------

 I take three pairs as (0,20), ( -1,21), and (1,19). But (1,19) is already in the first set. Can't reuse.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 there's a different way to arrange the first pairs to free up a number?

Wait, suppose I don't take the pair (9,11), but instead take (9, something else). But9 must pair with11. So no.

Alternatively, is

---------------

 there a pair that can be formed outside the 1-19 range but still gives a lower total than48?

Wait, for

---------------

 example, take a= -3 and23: total52, which is worse.

Alternatively, a= -4 and24: 56.

No.

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 instead of taking three pairs beyond the first9, maybe there is a smarter way.

Wait, if I take the first10 pairs as follows:

Take pairs (0,20), (1,19), (2,18), ..., (9,11). That's10 pairs:

(0,20) contributes42,

Then (1,19) to(9,11) are9 pairs contributing40 each.

Total for10 pairs:42 +9×40= 42+360=402.

Then remaining two pairs need to be formed from remaining numbers.

The used numbers so far are0,20, and1-9,11-19. So total used numbers:2+18=20. Remaining numbers: -1,-2,... and21,22,...

Need four more numbers,

---------------

 forming two pairs.

To minimize, take the next best pairs:

Pair (-1,21):44,

Pair (-2,22):48.

Total for these two pairs:44+48=92.

Total overall:402+92=494. Same result.

Alternatively, if I take the first11 pairs as:

(0,20)=42,

(1,19)=40,

(2,18)=40,

...

(10th pair: (10,10) invalid),

Wait no, can't do that. So up to (10 pairs: (0,20) plus nine pairs from1-9 and11-19 (

---------------

excluding10). So same as before.

Alternatively, take first pair as (0,20), then pairs (1,19) to (10,10) but the

---------------

 last is invalid.

No, so no improvement.

Alternatively, another configuration where two of the additional pairs are ( -1,21) and ( -0,20), but -0 is0, so that's same as before.

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 take pairs like ( -1,21), ( -2,22), and ( -3,23), totaling three pairs with contributions44,48,52. That would be worse.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 using a= 20 and0, then a= 21 and-1, and a=19 and1 (already counted). No, can't.

Hmm. It seems no matter how I arrange it, the minimal total I can get is494. Therefore, I think that must be the answer.

But wait, wait a second. Let me think differently. The expression |y -1| + |y +1| can be written as 2*max(|y|,1). Wait let me see:

Wait, for y >=1, it's2y. Since y>=1, max(|y|,1)=y, so2y.

For y between-1 and1, it's2, which is2*max(1, since |y| <=1).

For y <=-1, it's-2y. Since y is negative, -2y=2|y|. And since |y| >=1, so that's 2*|y|.

Therefore, the expression simplifies to 2*max(|y|,1).

Therefore, the total sum is 2*sum_{n=1}^{24} max(|y_n|,1).

Therefore, to minimize the total sum, we need to minimize the sum of max(|y_n|,1) over all24 points.

Ah

---------------

, this is a key insight! Maybe this reformulation can help.

Since max(|y|,1) is equal to |y| if |y| >=1, else1.

Therefore, the total sum is twice the sum over all y_n of max(|y_n|,1).

Therefore, to minimize this, we need as many y_n as possible with |y_n| <1, i.e., y_n in {-0,0}, but since they have to be integers, only y=0 is in that range where max(|y|,1)=1. The points y=-1 and1 have max(|y|,1)=1 as well? Wait no:

Wait for y=1: |1|=1, so max(|1|,1)=1, so contribution1.

Similarly y=-1: max(1,1)=1.

y=0: max(0,1)=1.

Therefore, for y in {-1,0,1}, the max is1. For other integers, it's |y|.

Therefore, the total sum is 2*(number_of_points_in_{-1,0,1} *1 + sum_{other points} |y| )

Therefore, to minimize this, we want as many points as possible in {-1,0,1}, and for the remaining points, have their absolute values as small as possible.

However, due to the reflection condition, each pair (y,20 -y) must be such that they are reflections across10. So for each such pair, if one is in {-1,0,1}, the other will be20 - y, which will be in {19,20,21}. So

---------------

 for each point in {-1,0,1}, its pair is in {19,20,21}. Thus, the pairs involving {-1,0,1} will have one point contributing1 and the other contributing max(|20 - y|,1). For y in {-1,0,1}, 20 - y is in {21,20,19}, so their contributions are max(21,1)=21, max(20,1)=20, max(19,1)=19. Therefore, those pairs would contribute1 +21,1+20,1+19 respectively.

Thus, if we have a pair (y,20-y) where y is in {-1,0,1}, their total contribution to the sum is (1 + max(|20 - y|,1)). For y=-1:1+21=22, y=0:1+20=21, y=1:1+19=20.

Therefore, to minimize the total, if we have to include such pairs, it's better to have y=1 paired with19 (total20), then y=0 paired with20 (21), then y=-1 paired with21 (22). So the minimal contribution for each such pair is20,21,22.

However, if we don't use these points in {-1,0,1}, then their pairs are in {19,20,21}, which would contribute max(|19|,1)=19, max(20,1)=20, max(21,1)=21.

Wait, let's clarify:

If we don't use y=1, then the pair (1,19) would be part of the main

---------------

 pairs contributing40, which corresponds to their contributions:

For y=1: contribution is1 (since |1| >=1, max(|1|,1)=1? Wait no, max(|1|,1) is1, but the expression is 2*max(|y|,1). Wait, no

---------------

:

Wait, the total contribution for the pair (1,19) is:

For y=1: max(|1|,1)=1,

For y=19:max(|19|,1)=19,

Total for the pair: (1 +19)*2=40, which matches previous calculation.

Similarly, if we instead have the pair (0,20):

For y=0: max(0,1)=1,

For y=20:max(20,1)=20,

Total contribution: (1+20)*2=42, which also matches.

Therefore, the earlier

---------------

 analysis holds.

Therefore, to minimize the total sum, we want as many pairs as possible to be from the 1-19 range (excluding10), giving

---------------

 contributions of40 each, and the remaining pairs must be formed with points outside, adding the minimal possible.

Therefore, the minimal total is indeed494. Hence

---------------

, the answer is 494.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, the answer should be in a box as Answer: \boxed{494}

But let me cross-verify once more:

Total for first9 pairs:9×40=360.

Additional three pairs:

(0,20):42,

(-1,21):44,

(-2,22):48,

Total:42+44+48=134,

360+134=494.

Yes, that seems correct.

However, let me see an alternative configuration where the three extra pairs are (0,20), ( -1,21), and ( 10,10). But the last is invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 another approach where instead of taking -2,22, take another pair with a higher number but lower contribution? Not possible.

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 using a different set of three pairs beyond the first9 that somehow overlap?

No, all must be distinct.

Hmm. I think I've exhausted all possibilities, so I'll go with494.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{494}


To solve the problem, we need to find the minimum possible value of the sum \(\sum_{n=1}^{24} (|y_n - 1| + |y_n + 1|)\) for 24 distinct integer points \(y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_{24}\) such that each pair \(y_{2k-1}\) and \(y_{2k}\) are reflections across \(x = 10\). 

### Key Steps:

1. **Reflections and Pair Sum**:
   - Each pair \((y_{2k-1}, y_{2k})\) must satisfy \(y_{2k-1} + y_{2k} = 20\).

2. **Expression Simplification**:
   - The expression \(|y - 1| + |y + 1|\) simplifies to:
     - \(2y\) if \(y \geq 1\),
     - \(2\) if \(-1 \leq y \leq 1\),
     - \(-2y\) if \(y \leq -1\).

3. **Optimal Pair Contribution**:
   - For pairs \((a, 20 - a)\), the total contribution is minimized when \(a\) is in the range \([1, 19]\), excluding 10, resulting in a contribution of 40 per pair.
   - Pairs involving values outside this range (e.g., 0, 20, -1, 21, etc.) have higher contributions.

4. **Maximizing Optimal Pairs**:
   - The maximum number of pairs with contribution 40 is 9, using numbers from 1 to 19 (excluding 10), which gives 18 distinct integers.
   - The remaining 6 numbers must form 3 pairs, which must be outside the 1-19 range.

5. **Remaining Pairs**:
   - The next optimal pairs are:
     - \((0, 20)\) contributing 42,
     - \((-1, 21)\) contributing 44,
     - \((-2, 22)\) contributing 48.

### Calculations:
- Contribution from 9 optimal pairs: \(9 \times 40 = 360\)
- Contribution from remaining 3 pairs: \(42 + 44 + 48 = 134\)
- Total minimum value: \(360 + 134 = 494\)

### Final Answer:
\boxed{494}<|im_end|>
