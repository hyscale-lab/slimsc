Okay, so I need to solve this problem about Pick's Formula and figure out the greatest possible value of the ratio n = I/B where Pat mistakenly

---------------

 swapped I and B, leading to an area that was too small by 35. Hmm. Let me start by recalling Pick's Formula properly. 



---------------

Pick’s Formula states that the area A of a polygon with integer coordinates is A = I + (B/2) - 1, where I is the number of interior lattice points and B is the number of boundary lattice points. 



---------------

Pat used the formula but swapped I and B, so Pat calculated the area as A' = B + (I/2) - 1. The problem says this incorrect calculation was too small by 35, so the actual area A

---------------

 is 35 more than Pat's result. Therefore, we can write the equation:

A = A' + 35  
But since

---------------

 A is also equal to I + (B/2) - 1, substituting gives:

I + (B/2) - 1 = [B + (I/2) - 1] + 35

Let me write that out step by step.

---------------

 

Original formula:  
A = I + (B/2) - 1  

Pat's incorrect formula:  
A' = B + (I/2) - 1  

Given that A = A' + 35, so:



---------------

I + (B/2) - 1 = B + (I/2) - 1 + 35

Let

---------------

 me simplify both sides. Let's subtract the right-hand side from both sides to see the difference, but maybe it's easier to rearrange the equation.

---------------

 

First, subtract the right-hand side from both sides:

I + (B/2) - 1 - [B + (I/2) - 1] = 35

Simplify the left side:

I + (B/2) -1 - B - (I/2) + 1 = 35

Combine

---------------

 like terms:

I - (I/2) + (B/2 - B) + (-1 +1) = 35  
Which

---------------

 simplifies to:

(I/2) - (B/2) = 35  
Multiply both sides by 2:

I - B = 70

So,

---------------

 we have the equation I - B = 70.

Additionally, the problem states that the ratio n = I/B is an integer, and we need the greatest possible value of n.

So

---------------

, we need to maximize n = I/B, given that I - B =70 and n is an integer.

Let

---------------

 me write I = B +70. Then n = (B +70)/B = 1 + 70/B. Since n must be an integer, 70/B must also be an integer. Therefore, B must be a divisor of 70. 

Wait

---------------

, but we also have to remember that in Pick's formula, B counts the number of boundary points. For a polygon on a lattice, B must be a positive integer, and I

---------------

 must also be a non-negative integer. Also, since I = B +70, then B can't be so large that I would be negative

---------------

, but since B is positive, I is at least 71 (if B is 1). But we need to ensure

---------------

 that the polygon actually exists with those values. Hmm, but maybe the constraints from Pick's theorem are more involved?

Wait, maybe

---------------

 there's more constraints. Let me recall that in Pick's theorem, the area must be a positive number, so I + (B/2) -1 must be positive. Also

---------------

, for a polygon, B must be at least 3 (since a polygon must have at least 3 sides, hence

---------------

 at least 3 boundary points). But actually, even a triangle on a lattice has at least 3 boundary points. So

---------------

 B must be an integer greater or equal to 3, and I must be a non-negative integer. 

Additionally, the

---------------

 formula requires that B and I are integers. Since we already have I = B +70, and n = I/B must be an integer, let

---------------

's think again. 

Since n = (B +70)/B must be an integer. Let me denote n = k, so

---------------

 k = 1 + 70/B. Therefore, 70/B must be an integer, so B must divide 70. 



---------------

Therefore, possible values of B are the positive divisors of 70. Since B must divide 70, the

---------------

 divisors of 70 are: 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35, 70. 

But as

---------------

 mentioned, B must be at least 3 (since a polygon can't have less than 3 boundary points). So possible

---------------

 B values are 5,7,10,14,35,70. 

Wait, hold on,

---------------

 1 and 2 are excluded. So starting from B=5 upwards. 

We need to maximize k = (B +70)/B = 1 + 70/B. To maximize k, we need to minimize B.

---------------

 Wait, but that would give a higher value? Wait, actually, if B is smaller, 70/B is larger, so k is

---------------

 larger. Therefore, the smallest possible B (which is 5 here) would give the largest k. Wait, but let

---------------

 me check:

If B=5, then k = (5 +70)/5 =75/5=15.

---------------

 

If B=7, then k=(7+70)/7=77/7=11.

If B=10, then (10+70)/10=80/10=8.

B=14: 14+70=84/

---------------

14=6.

B=35: 35+70=105/35=3.

B=70: 70+70=140/70=2.

So

---------------

, the largest possible k here is 15, when B=5. 

But wait, but hold on. Before

---------------

 jumping to the conclusion, we need to check if such a polygon can actually exist with B=5 and I=75. Because Pick

---------------

's theorem has some constraints. 

For instance, in Pick's formula, the area must equal I + B/2 -1. So

---------------

, if B=5 and I=75, then the area would be 75 +5/2 -1 = 75 +2.5 -1=76.5. But

---------------

 area must be a positive real number, which it is, but polygons on lattice points must have areas that are half-integers? Wait, actually, the

---------------

 area according to Pick's theorem can be a half-integer, yes. For example, a triangle with base and height 1 would have area 0.5, which would

---------------

 correspond to I=0 and B=3, so 0 + 3/2 -1 = 0.5. 

So 

---------------

76.5 is okay. But perhaps there's another constraint? For instance, the number of boundary points B must satisfy certain

---------------

 conditions with the actual edges of the polygon. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem allows any I and B as long as they satisfy the equation I - B =70 and n is integer, but

---------------

 the problem says "using the correct values for I and B", so they must correspond to some actual polygon. 

Therefore, perhaps

---------------

 there are additional constraints from Pick's theorem. For instance, in Pick's theorem, the area must be equal to I + B/2 -1, so

---------------

 the area must be at least 1 (since the smallest polygon is a triangle with area 0.5, but maybe

---------------

 that's allowed). Wait, actually a polygon can have area 0.5. So maybe the only constraints are that I and B are non-negative integers with B ≥ 3,

---------------

 and that the area is positive. 

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "the vertices of a polygon all lie on a rectangular lattice". So it

---------------

's a polygon with vertices on lattice points, but the edges can go through other lattice points. 

However, there is also

---------------

 the condition that for any polygon, the number of boundary points B must satisfy certain properties. For instance, each edge of the polygon must have at least 2 lattice points (its endpoints). The

---------------

 number of edges is equal to the number of sides, which is at least 3. 

But maybe the key point here is that for

---------------

 a polygon with B boundary points, each edge contributes at least 1 lattice point (the vertices), but actually, each edge between

---------------

 two vertices will have exactly gcd(delta_x, delta_y) +1 lattice points, where delta_x and delta_y are the differences in coordinates. So

---------------

 the total number of boundary points B is equal to the sum over edges of gcd(delta_x, delta_y) for each edge. 

Therefore

---------------

, B must be at least the number of edges (since each edge contributes at least 1, but actually more if the edge is longer). 



---------------

However, maybe this complicates things. Since the problem doesn't specify any further constraints, maybe we can assume that as long as B and I are integers with B ≥3 and I ≥0, and the

---------------

 area is positive (so I + B/2 -1 ≥0), then such a polygon exists? 

Wait, let

---------------

's check for B=5 and I=75. The area would be 75 + 5/2 -1 = 75 +2.5 -1 = 76.5. That

---------------

 seems okay. 

But maybe there is another constraint from Pick's theorem that relates I and B? For example, maybe the

---------------

 area must be at least something? Not sure. Let me think. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the

---------------

 only constraints are that B divides 70, B ≥3, and I = B +70 is non-negative, so the

---------------

 maximum n is 15. 

However, let me check with B=5. Let's see if a polygon with B=5 and I=75 is

---------------

 possible. 

Wait, a polygon with only 5 boundary points. Let's consider that. For example, a convex polygon with 5 vertices?

---------------

 But each edge between two vertices would contribute lattice points. 

Wait, the minimal B for a polygon with m edges is m, but actually

---------------

, each edge between two vertices can have more lattice points. For example, a square with side length 1 has 4 vertices and each edge has 2 points (so total

---------------

 boundary points 4, since the corners are counted once each). Wait, actually, each edge of a unit square has endpoints

---------------

 only, so each edge contributes 2 points, but since they are shared between edges, total boundary points would be 4. 

Wait

---------------

, in general, for a polygon with m edges, the number of boundary points is the sum over edges of (gcd(delta_x, delta_y) for each edge). 



---------------

So for a polygon with 5 boundary points, that would require that the total sum over edges of gcd(delta_x, delta_y) is

---------------

 5. Since each edge must have at least 1 (the endpoints), so for a polygon with m edges, the

---------------

 minimal B is m. So for a triangle (3 edges), minimal B is 3. For a quadrilateral (4 edges), minimal B is 4, etc. 

Therefore

---------------

, if B=5, then the polygon could be a triangle with edges that have some lattice points along them. 

Wait, let

---------------

's see an example. Let's try to make a polygon with B=5. 

Suppose a triangle where each side has one

---------------

 lattice point in between. For example, take a right triangle with legs of length 2. The vertices at (0,0), (2,0), (0,2). The

---------------

 edges: from (0,0) to (2,0): has 3 points (including endpoints). From (2,0) to (0,2): the difference

---------------

 is (-2,2). The gcd of 2 and 2 is 2, so number of points on that edge is gcd(2,2)+1 = 3. Similarly, the edge from (0,2) to (0,0): 

---------------

3 points. 

Wait, but then total boundary points would be 3 + 3 + 3 - 3 (since the vertices are counted twice) = 6 - 3?

---------------

 Wait no, actually when you add up all the edges' points, you have to subtract the vertices because they are counted twice. Wait

---------------

, perhaps the formula is that B = sum_{edges} (gcd(delta_x, delta_y) +1) - m, where m is the number of edges (

---------------

since each vertex is counted in two edges). Wait, maybe better to think of each edge contributes (gcd(delta_x, delta_y) +1) points, but each

---------------

 vertex is shared by two edges. 

Wait, actually, the total number of boundary points B is equal to the sum over all edges of (gcd(delta_x, delta_y) for

---------------

 that edge). Because each edge between two vertices has gcd(delta_x, delta_y) steps, so the number of lattice points on the edge is

---------------

 gcd(delta_x, delta_y) +1, but when you traverse the polygon, each vertex is counted in two edges, so when

---------------

 you add up all edges' (gcd +1), you get B + m, where m is the number of edges (

---------------

since each vertex is counted twice, so subtract m). Therefore, B = sum_{edges} gcd(delta_x, delta_y). 



---------------

Therefore, for each edge, the number of lattice points on it is gcd(delta_x, delta_y) +1, so the total lattice

---------------

 points on all edges would be sum (gcd +1) over edges, which equals B + m. Hence, B = sum(g

---------------

cd) over edges. 

Therefore, to have B=5, the sum of gcds over all edges must be 5. Let

---------------

's see. Let's take a triangle (3 edges). Then, to have sum of gcds equal to 5. Let

---------------

 me see: for example, one edge with gcd 2, and the other two edges with gcd 1 each. So

---------------

 2+1+1=4. Not enough. To get 5, perhaps one edge with gcd 3, and two edges with gcd 1.

---------------

 3+1+1=5. 

Is that possible? Let's try to construct such a triangle. 

Suppose we

---------------

 have a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (3,0), and (0,1). 

First edge from (0,0) to (3,0): delta_x=3, delta_y=0. gcd

---------------

(3,0)=3. So that edge contributes 3 to the sum. 

Second edge from (3,0) to (0,1): delta_x=-3, delta_y=1. gcd(3,1)=1. 

Third edge from (0,1) to (0,0): delta_x=0, delta_y=-1. gcd(0,1)=1. 

Thus

---------------

 total B=3+1+1=5. 

Therefore, such a triangle exists with B=5. So that

---------------

's possible. 

So in this case, the boundary points are 5, so that works. Then I would need to be 75?

---------------

 Wait, but in this case, the area would be I + B/2 -1. Let's calculate the area of that triangle first

---------------

. 

The triangle with vertices (0,0), (3,0), (0,1). The area is (base * height)/2 = (3 *1)/2 = 1.5. 

But

---------------

 according to Pick's formula, that area should equal I + B/2 -1. 

So 1.5 = I + 5/2 -1 →

---------------

 I + 1.5 = 1.5 → I = 0. 

But in our problem, we have

---------------

 I = B +70, so if B=5, then I=75, which would give an area of 75 + 5/2 -1 = 76.5. That

---------------

's way larger than the actual area of 1.5. 

Ah, so that shows a problem. The example I just

---------------

 made has B=5 and I=0, but the problem requires that I = B +70. So in this

---------------

 case, such a polygon can't have I=75 if B=5. 

Therefore, my mistake was assuming that any

---------------

 B and I satisfying I - B =70 would work, but actually, Pick's theorem requires that the area must be

---------------

 equal to I + B/2 -1. Therefore, the values of I and B must also satisfy that the area is

---------------

 consistent with some polygon. 

Therefore, in order to have I = B +70, the area would be I + B/2 -1 = (B +70) + B/2 -1 = (3B/2) +69. 

But this

---------------

 area must also be equal to the actual area of some polygon with those B and I. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows

---------------

 for any I and B as long as they are integers with B ≥3, I ≥0, and the area is positive,

---------------

 but in reality, there are more constraints. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is set in such a way that we don't have to worry about the actual

---------------

 existence of the polygon, and just work with the algebra given. The problem says "using the correct values for I and B", so they

---------------

 must satisfy Pick's formula for some polygon, so perhaps we need to ensure that the area computed via Pick's formula is possible

---------------

. 

Wait, but how do we know that there exists a polygon with given B and I? That might be complicated, but perhaps the

---------------

 problem is designed so that we can ignore that and just use the equation I - B =70 and n = I/B is

---------------

 integer, so the maximum n is 15. However, in the example above, that would require I=75 and B=5, but such

---------------

 a polygon would have an area of 76.5, but if you can find a polygon with such a large I and

---------------

 small B, maybe it's possible. 

Alternatively, perhaps I and B must satisfy some inequality. For example, in Pick's theorem, the

---------------

 area must be at least 1 (if it's a triangle with area 0.5, but maybe the problem allows

---------------

 that). Wait, but the area when I=0 and B=3 would be 0 + 3/2 -1 = 0.5, which is acceptable

---------------

. 

But in our case, if I = B +70, then the area is (3B/2) +69. Since

---------------

 area must be positive, this is always true as B is positive. 

However, another constraint comes from Euler's formula for planar graphs?

---------------

 Wait, perhaps not necessary here. 

Alternatively, maybe there is a relation between I and B in Pick's theorem. Let me think.

---------------

 For a polygon, the number of interior points I and boundary points B must satisfy some inequality? 

Wait, according to Pick's theorem, the

---------------

 area is I + B/2 -1. Since the area must be at least 0.5 (for a minimal triangle), so

---------------

 I + B/2 -1 ≥ 0.5 → I + B/2 ≥ 1.5. But

---------------

 with I = B +70, that would give B +70 + B/2 ≥ 1.5 → (3B)/2 +70 ≥1.5, which is always

---------------

 true for positive B. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting that we can proceed purely algebraically, given that the problem

---------------

 states "using the correct values for I and B", so they must satisfy Pick's formula, but the question is only about the ratio n = I/B being an integer. 



---------------

Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting us to proceed with the algebra, and the constraints are just that B divides 70 and B ≥3, so the maximum n is 15. 

But the

---------------

 problem mentions that Pat's calculation was too small by 35. Let me check with B=5 and I=75. 

Pat

---------------

's calculation was A' = B + I/2 -1 =5 +75/2 -1 =5 +37.5 -1=41.5. The actual area is A =75 +5/2 -1=76.5. The difference is 76.5 -41.5 =35, which matches. 

Therefore, the

---------------

 problem is set up so that as long as I - B =70 and n is integer, then such a polygon exists.

---------------

 Therefore, the maximum n is 15. 

Wait, but in the example I thought of earlier with B=5 and I=0, that

---------------

 gives a different scenario, but in that case, the problem would not have I - B =70. 

Therefore, if

---------------

 we just take the mathematical constraints given by the problem, which are I - B =70 and n=I/B is

---------------

 integer, then the maximum n is indeed 15, when B=5 and I=75. 

Therefore, maybe

---------------

 the answer is 15. But let me check with another possible B. 

Take B=7, which gives n=(7+70)/7=77/7=11. That

---------------

's lower. 

Similarly, B=10 gives 80/10=8. So yes, 15 is the maximum. 

But

---------------

 let me check if there are any other divisors of 70 that I missed. 

Divisors of 70: 1,2,5,7,10,14,35,70. 



---------------

We excluded 1 and 2 since B must be at least 3. So the next is 5,7, etc. So 

---------------

5 is the smallest B, leading to the largest n. 

Therefore, unless there is a hidden constraint, 15 is the answer. 

Wait

---------------

, but in the problem statement, it says "the vertices of a polygon all lie on a rectangular lattice". So maybe the

---------------

 polygon must be a simple polygon (not self-intersecting), but that might not affect the count. 

Alternatively, perhaps the

---------------

 number of boundary points B must be at least the number of edges, but as we saw in the triangle with B=5, that

---------------

's okay. 

Alternatively, maybe the formula requires that B is at least 3, which we have. 

Therefore, given

---------------

 that the problem doesn't specify any further constraints, the answer should be 15. 

Wait, but let me think

---------------

 again. Let me check for B=5, I=75. 

Suppose there exists a polygon with B=5 boundary points and I=75 interior points. The

---------------

 area would be 75 + 5/2 -1 = 76.5. 

Is such a polygon possible? 



---------------

I can imagine a very large polygon with a huge area, so the number of interior points can be large. For example, a

---------------

 polygon that's almost a large rectangle with a small "bite" taken out so that the boundary points remain small. 

Alternatively, think

---------------

 of a polygon that is a convex polygon with a very large area but only 5 boundary points. Wait, but convex polygons with 

---------------

5 boundary points would have 5 vertices? 

Wait, if it's a convex polygon with 5 vertices, then each

---------------

 edge can't have too many lattice points. 

Alternatively, maybe a polygon that is very "wiggly" but still

---------------

 has only 5 boundary points? Hmm, not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the polygon is a spiral or something, but the

---------------

 key is that the boundary points count all the lattice points on the edges, not just the vertices. 

Wait, but if

---------------

 you have a polygon with only 5 boundary points, that suggests that all edges have minimal lattice points. For instance, edges

---------------

 that are between vertices that are adjacent on the lattice (so gcd(delta_x, delta_y)=1). Except for one edge which

---------------

 has gcd=2? 

Wait, for example, take a polygon with vertices arranged such that most edges have gcd 1, but one edge has gcd 2. 



---------------

Wait, let me think of a polygon with B=5. Let me try to create a polygon where B=5.

---------------

 

Suppose we have a polygon like a "house" shape but with minimal points. 

Alternatively, a polygon with vertices at (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,0), but that's a square with B=4. 

Alternatively, a

---------------

 polygon with vertices (0,0), (2,0), (1,1), (0,1). Let's see:



---------------

Edges:

(0,0) to (2,0): gcd(2,0)=2, so contributes 2.

(2,0) to (1,1): gcd(1,1)=1, so contributes 1.

(1,1) to (0,1): gcd(1,0)=1, contributes 1.

(0,1) to (0,0): gcd(0,1)=1, contributes 1.

Total B = 2 +1+1+1=5. 

So that's a quadrilateral with B=5. 



---------------

Now, let's compute its area. The coordinates are (0,0), (2,0), (1,1), (0,1). 



---------------

Using the shoelace formula:

Order of points: (0,0), (2,0), (1,1), (0,1), back to (0,0).

Compute sum of x_i y_{i+1}:

0*0 + 2*1 +1*1 +0*0 = 0 + 2 +1 +0 =3.

Sum of y_i x_{i+1}:

0*2 +0*1 +1*0 +1*0 =0 +0 +0 +0=0.

Area = |3 -0| /2 =1.5.

Pick

---------------

's formula: I + B/2 -1. 

We have B=5, area=1.5. So

---------------

 I + 5/2 -1 = I +1.5=1.5 ⇒ I=0.

Thus, again

---------------

, if we want I=75 and B=5, the area would need to be 76.5, but this

---------------

 example only gives I=0. 

Therefore, to have I=75, the polygon must enclose a huge area with very few boundary points. 



---------------

Perhaps a polygon that is a large rectangle with a small hole? Wait, but holes would complicate the lattice points. Alternatively

---------------

, a polygon that is a very long and thin rectangle with a zig-zag path, but keeping the number of boundary points low. 

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 a polygon that is almost a square of side length L, but with some edges adjusted so that the total boundary points remain 5? Probably

---------------

 not. 

Alternatively, maybe a polygon that is a large square with most edges aligned along the grid, but with one side ind

---------------

ented slightly so that the total boundary points remain 5? 

Alternatively, perhaps it's possible through some complex shape. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the problem is purely mathematical, and existence isn't required? The problem states "using the correct values for I and B", so maybe

---------------

 as long as the values satisfy the equation I - B =70 and n is integer, then it's acceptable, even if constructing such a polygon is non-trivial. 

Given

---------------

 that the problem is from a competition, maybe we are to assume that such a polygon exists as long as the basic conditions (B divides 70, B ≥3, I non

---------------

-negative) are met. Therefore, the answer is 15. 

Alternatively, perhaps there is an upper bound on n because

---------------

 B must be at least something related to I? For instance, in Pick's theorem, maybe the area must be at least B

---------------

/2 -1, so I must be at least ... Wait, area = I + B/2 -1, so I = Area - B/2 +1. Since

---------------

 area must be positive, I can be zero or positive. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants us to consider that B must be greater than or equal to 3, but

---------------

 since we already considered that, and the maximum n is 15. 

Alternatively, maybe there is a mistake in my initial

---------------

 equation. Let me recheck the setup. 

Pat applied Pick's formula with I and B swapped, so Pat computed A

---------------

' = B + (I)/2 -1. 

The correct area is A = I + (B)/2 -1. 

The problem states that Pat's area was too small by 35, so A - A' =35. 

Therefore

---------------

:

A - A' = [I + B/2 -1] - [B + I/2 -1] = I - B + (B/2 - I/2) = I - B - (I - B)/2 = (I - B)/

---------------

2 *2? Wait, perhaps better to recompute:

Let me recompute the difference:

A - A' = (I + B/2 -1) - (B + I/2 -1) = I - B + (B/2 - I/2) = I - B - (I - B)/2 = (2(I - B) - (I - B))/2 = (I - B)/2.

---------------

 

Wait, that contradicts my previous result. Wait, let me do term by term:

Expand the terms:

I + (B/2) -1 - B - (I/2) +1 =

---------------

 [I - (I/2)] + [(B/2 - B)] + [-1 +1]

So that is (I/2) + (- B/2) + 0 = (I - B)/2.

---------------

 

So the difference A - A' = (I - B)/2 =35. 

Therefore, (I - B)/2 =35 ⇒ I - B =70. 

Ah

---------------

! Wait a second! I made a mistake earlier. The difference is (I - B)/2 =35, so I - B=70. Which

---------------

 is what I had before. So that part was correct. 

Therefore, my equations are correct. 

Therefore, the rest

---------------

 follows. 

Hence, since the problem allows for any I and B that satisfy I - B =70 and n=I/B is integer, with

---------------

 B dividing 70 and B≥3, then the maximum n is 15. 

Therefore, I think the answer is 15. 

Wait

---------------

, but let me confirm once again with the problem's exact wording: "the ratio n = I/B is an integer. Find the greatest possible value of n." So we

---------------

 need to maximize n = I/B, given I - B =70 and B divides 70 (since n = (B +70)/B must be integer).

---------------

 

Therefore, yes, the maximum is 15. 

Therefore, the answer is 15.

**Final Answer**
Answer: 15


Pat applied Pick’s Formula to

---------------

 find the area of a polygon but mistakenly interchanged the values of \( I \) (interior lattice points) and \( B \) (boundary lattice points). The correct area using Pick’s Formula is \( A = I + \frac{B}{2} - 1 \), while Pat calculated \( A' = B + \frac{I}{2} - 1 \). The problem states that Pat’s result was too small by 35, so we have:

\[
A - A' = 35
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( A \) and \( A' \):

\[
\left( I + \frac{B}{2} - 1 \right) - \left( B + \frac{I}{2} - 1 \right) = 35
\]

Simplifying the left-hand side:

\[
I + \frac{B}{2} - 1 - B - \frac{I}{2} + 1 = \frac{I}{2} - \frac{B}{2} = \frac{I - B}{2}
\]

Thus, we get:

\[
\frac{I - B}{2} = 35 \implies I - B = 70
\]

We need to find the greatest possible value of \( n = \frac{I}{B} \) where \( n \) is an integer. Expressing \( I \) in terms of \( B \):

\[
I = B + 70
\]

Substituting into \( n \):

\[
n = \frac{B + 70}{B} = 1 + \frac{70}{B}
\]

For \( n \) to be an integer, \( \frac{70}{B} \) must be an integer, meaning \( B \) must be a divisor of 70. The divisors of 70 are 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35, and 70. Since \( B \) must be at least 3 (as a polygon must have at least 3 boundary points), the valid divisors are 5, 7, 10, 14, 35, and 70. 

To maximize \( n \), we choose the smallest valid \( B \):

- If \( B = 5 \), then \( n = 1 + \frac{70}{5} = 15 \)
- If \( B = 7 \), then \( n = 1 + \frac{70}{7} = 11 \)
- If \( B = 10 \), then \( n = 1 + \frac{70}{10} = 8 \)
- If \( B = 14 \), then \( n = 1 + \frac{70}{14} = 6 \)
- If \( B = 35 \), then \( n = 1 + \frac{70}{35} = 3 \)
- If \( B = 70 \), then \( n = 1 + \frac{70}{70} = 2 \)

The greatest possible value of \( n \) is 15 when \( B = 5 \).
