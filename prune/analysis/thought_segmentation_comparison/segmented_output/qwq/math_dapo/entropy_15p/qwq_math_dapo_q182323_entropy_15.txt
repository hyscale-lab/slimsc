Okay, so the problem is about figuring out the minimum number of at bats Danielle could have to have a batting average of 0.399. Hmm

---------------

, batting average is hits divided by at bats, rounded to three decimal places. Alright, so we need to find the smallest number of at bats (let's call that AB

---------------

) such that when you divide the hits (H) by AB and round to three decimals, you get 0.399. 

First, I remember

---------------

 that when rounding to three decimal places, the actual value before rounding could be anywhere from 0.3985 to just under 0.3995. Because if it was 0.3985 or higher, rounding to three decimals would give 0.399, right? Similarly

---------------

, anything less than 0.3985 would round down to 0.398, and anything 0.3995 or higher would round up to 0.400. So the key

---------------

 here is to find the smallest AB where H/AB is in that interval [0.3985, 0.3995).

So,

---------------

 mathematically, we need integers H and AB such that 0.3985 ≤ H/AB < 0.3995, and we want the smallest possible AB. Since

---------------

 H and AB are integers, H must be the floor of (AB * 0.3995) minus some

---------------

, but maybe I need a better approach.

Alternatively, let's think of it as inequalities:

0.3985 ≤ H / AB < 0.3995

Multip

---------------

lying all parts by AB:

0.3985 * AB ≤ H < 0.3995 * AB

Since H must be an integer, the

---------------

 number of hits must be an integer between 0.3985*AB and 0.3995*AB. Therefore

---------------

, the difference between the upper and lower bounds must be at least 1 for there to exist an integer H in that interval. Wait, actually

---------------

, that might not be necessary, but perhaps the interval length must be at least 1. Let me think.

Alternatively, for

---------------

 some integer H, H must satisfy both H ≥ 0.3985*AB and H < 0.3995*AB. So,

---------------

 the difference between the upper and lower bounds must be at least 1? Hmm, maybe not exactly. Let me think of

---------------

 it as the ceiling of the lower bound must be less than the upper bound. So, the smallest H that's possible is the ceiling of 0.3985*AB, and that

---------------

 must be less than 0.3995*AB. 

Therefore, ceiling(0.3985*AB) < 0.3995*AB. Which

---------------

 would imply that 0.3985*AB must be such that when you take the ceiling, it's still less than 0.3995*AB. Hmm

---------------

, maybe this is getting too convoluted. Perhaps I should approach this by considering fractions and trying to find the minimal AB such that there's an integer H where

---------------

 H/AB is in that interval.

Alternatively, perhaps think of the problem as H/AB must be in [0.3985, 0.3995). To

---------------

 find the minimal AB, we can set up the inequalities:

H ≥ 0.3985 * AB

and

H < 0.3995 * AB

Since

---------------

 H must be an integer, the smallest possible H for a given AB would be the floor(0.3995*AB)

---------------

 but also needs to satisfy the first inequality. Alternatively, perhaps a better way is to express H as the nearest integer? Wait

---------------

, not exactly. Let me think of this as a continued fraction or something else?

Alternatively, since we need the minimal AB, maybe try

---------------

 AB starting from small numbers and see if there's an H that satisfies the inequalities. But that might take a while. Let

---------------

 me see if there's a smarter way.

Let me rewrite the inequalities:

Let me denote the lower bound as L = 0.3985 and upper bound U = 0.3995.

So,

---------------

 L ≤ H/AB < U.

So, rearranged, H must be between L*AB and U*AB.

Therefore

---------------

, the interval (L*AB, U*AB) must contain at least one integer. To have such an integer H

---------------

, the length of the interval must be greater than 1? Wait, no. The interval length is U*AB - L*AB = (U - L)*AB = 0.001*AB. For

---------------

 this interval to contain at least one integer, the length must be at least 1? Hmm, not exactly. Because even if the interval is less

---------------

 than 1, if the fractional parts align, it might still contain an integer. For example, an interval of length 0.5 can

---------------

 contain an integer if it's placed right. But perhaps the necessary condition is that the interval length must be at least 1 for

---------------

 it to be guaranteed, but since we just need existence, maybe there's a smaller AB where the interval coincidentally includes an integer even

---------------

 with length less than 1. 

But perhaps it's better to think of it as:

We need there to exist an integer H such that L

---------------

*AB ≤ H < U*AB.

Which is equivalent to:

There exists an integer H with H ≥ L*AB and H < U*AB.

So

---------------

, the smallest AB for which such an H exists is what we need.

Alternatively, for each AB starting from 1 upwards, check if the

---------------

 interval [0.3985*AB, 0.3995*AB) contains an integer. Once we

---------------

 find the smallest AB where this is true, that's our answer.

But doing this manually might be tedious, so perhaps we

---------------

 can set up the inequalities.

Let me denote AB as n. We need integers H such that 0.3985n ≤ H < 0.3995n.

So

---------------

, H must be an integer in that interval. Therefore, the ceiling of 0.3985n must be less than 0.3995n. 



---------------

Wait, let me think again. The ceiling of the lower bound must be less than the upper bound. So:

ceil(0.3985n) < 0.3995n.

Because

---------------

 if ceil(0.3985n) is less than the upper bound, then there is an integer H between

---------------

 them.

So:

ceil(0.3985n) < 0.3995n

Which

---------------

 can be written as:

ceil(0.3985n) ≤ 0.3995n - ε for some ε>0.

Alternatively

---------------

, rearranged:

0.3995n - 0.3985n > 1 - (

---------------

fractional part of 0.3985n)

Hmm, not sure. Let's think numerically.

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps write 0.3985n ≤ H < 0.3995n. Since H is integer, then

---------------

 H must be the integer closest to the midpoint, but perhaps I need another approach.

Alternatively, let me express 0.3985 and 0.3995 as fractions.

---------------

 0.3985 is 3985/10000, and 0.3995 is 3995/10000. So

---------------

, simplifying, 0.3985 = 797/2000 and 0.3995 = 799/2000.

---------------

 Wait, let me check:

3985 divided by 5 is 797, and 10000 divided by 5 is 2000. So yes, 0.3985 = 797/2000. Similarly, 3995/10000 is

---------------

 799/2000 (since 3995 divided by 5 is 799, and

---------------

 10000 divided by 5 is 2000). So, the inequalities become:

797/2000 ≤ H/n < 799/2000

Wait

---------------

, but actually, 0.3995 is 3995/10000 = 799/2000.

---------------

 So the interval is between 797/2000 and 799/2000.

---------------

 Wait, but actually, the original interval was 0.3985 ≤ H/n < 0.3995, so that

---------------

 is 3985/10000 ≤ H/n < 3995/10000. 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps cross-multiplying the inequalities to eliminate denominators. Let's see:

First inequality: H/n ≥ 0.3985 →

---------------

 H ≥ 0.3985n

Second inequality: H < 0.3995n

So

---------------

 H must be an integer between 0.3985n and 0.3995n. So

---------------

 the difference between upper and lower bounds is 0.001n. For there to exist an integer in this interval, the length of

---------------

 the interval must be at least 1? Wait, no, because if the interval is between two numbers that are 1 apart, then

---------------

 there must be an integer in between. But if the interval is smaller than 1, maybe not. Wait, actually, the

---------------

 interval length is 0.001n. To guarantee that there is an integer in the interval, we need 0.001n ≥1, so n ≥ 1000. But that

---------------

 would mean that n has to be at least 1000 to guarantee that. But since we are looking for the minimal n where it

---------------

 could possibly exist, maybe there's a smaller n where the interval just happens to include an integer even if the length is less than 1. 

Therefore

---------------

, perhaps the minimal n is less than 1000. Hmm. So maybe we can approach this as follows:



---------------

We need to find the smallest n such that there exists an integer H where 0.3985n ≤ H < 0.3995n.

Let

---------------

 me rearrange the inequalities:

H must be an integer in [0.3985n, 0.3995n).

---------------

 

So, the lower bound is 0.3985n, and the upper bound is 0.3995n. 



---------------

The difference between upper and lower is 0.001n. 

To have at least one integer in this interval, the ceiling

---------------

 of the lower bound must be less than the upper bound. So:

ceil(0.3985n) < 0.3995n

Therefore

---------------

, the smallest integer greater than or equal to 0.3985n must be less than 0.3995n. 

Let

---------------

 me denote k = ceil(0.3985n). Then we have:

k < 0.3995n

But

---------------

 also, since k is the ceiling, we have:

k -1 < 0.3985n ≤ k

Therefore, combining these

---------------

:

k -1 < 0.3985n ≤ k < 0.3995n

So

---------------

, substituting k < 0.3995n into the first inequality:

k -1 < 0.3985n ≤

---------------

 k < 0.3995n

So, from k < 0.3995n,

---------------

 and k ≥ 0.3985n (since 0.3985n ≤k). Therefore

---------------

, 0.3985n ≤k <0.3995n. 

So, substituting back

---------------

, k must be an integer in the interval [0.3985n, 0.3995n). 



---------------

Therefore, the key is that such a k must exist, so there must exist an integer in [0.3985n,0.3995n). 

Therefore

---------------

, the problem reduces to finding the minimal n where the interval [0.3985n, 0.3995n) contains an integer. 

Alternatively

---------------

, this is equivalent to saying that there exists an integer H such that 0.3985n ≤ H < 0.3995n. 

So

---------------

, perhaps we can write this as H / n is between 0.3985 and 0.3995. 

Alternatively

---------------

, we can think of this as a continued fraction problem where we want the minimal denominator n such that the fraction H/n approximates 0.399 to

---------------

 three decimal places. 

Alternatively, maybe consider the inequality:

0.3985 ≤ H/n < 0.3995

Multiply all terms by n:

0.3985n ≤ H < 0.3995n

So

---------------

 H must be an integer in that interval. So, the length of the interval is 0.001n. To

---------------

 have at least one integer in the interval, the length must be at least 1? Wait, but that would require n ≥ 1000. But maybe

---------------

 even with a smaller n, the interval could still contain an integer. 

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal n is when 0.3995n - 0.3985n ≥

---------------

1, so 0.001n ≥1 → n ≥1000. But that would be the minimal

---------------

 n required to guarantee that there is an integer in the interval. However, perhaps for some n less than 1000, the

---------------

 interval might still include an integer. 

Therefore, perhaps the minimal n is less than 1000. Let me try

---------------

 to find such n.

Let me consider that H must be an integer between 0.3985n and 0.3995n. Let

---------------

 me write this as:

H = round(0.399n) ?

Wait, but maybe not exactly. Let me think

---------------

 of fractions. 

Alternatively, maybe set up the inequality:

H = floor(0.3995n - ε) where

---------------

 ε is small. 

Alternatively, perhaps think of the problem as H/n must be in [0.3985, 0.3995). So

---------------

, H must be the nearest integer to 0.399n, but within that range. 

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 express 0.3985 and 0.3995 as fractions. 

Wait, 0.3985 is 797/2000 and 0.3995 is 799/2000. Wait

---------------

, 797 divided by 2000 is 0.3985, and 799/2000 is 0.3995. Wait

---------------

, but 799 divided by 2000 is 0.3995? Let me check:

---------------

 2000/10 is 200, so 799 divided by 2000: 799 divided

---------------

 by 2000 is 0.3995. Yes, because 0.3995 *

---------------

 2000 = 799. So, 797/2000 = 0.3985,

---------------

 799/2000 = 0.3995. 

So, the inequalities can be written as 797/2000 ≤ H/n < 799/2000. Wait

---------------

, but that's not exactly, because 0.3985 is 797/2000,

---------------

 so H/n must be at least that, but less than 799/2000. 

Wait, so

---------------

 cross-multiplying:

797/2000 ≤ H/n < 799/2000

Multiply

---------------

 all terms by 2000n:

797n ≤ 2000H < 799n

Hmm

---------------

, so:

797n ≤ 2000H < 799n

So, 2000H must be between 797n and 799n - 1 (since it's strictly less than 799n). 

Therefore

---------------

, 797n ≤ 2000H ≤ 799n -1

So, rearr

---------------

anged, we can write:

797n ≤ 2000H ≤ 799n -1

Div

---------------

iding by n:

797 ≤ 2000H/n ≤ 799 - 1/n

Hmm, but

---------------

 not sure if this helps. Alternatively, maybe consider the difference between 2000H and 797n must

---------------

 be non-negative and less than 2n (since 799n -1 -797n = 2n -1). 



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps this is getting too convoluted. Let's think of it as a Diophantine approximation problem. We need H

---------------

 and n such that H/n is as close as possible to 0.399, but within the given interval. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe try small values of n and see when the interval [0.3985n, 0.3995n) contains an integer. Let's try

---------------

 n=100: 0.3985*100=39.85, 0.3995*100=39.95. So the interval is [39.85, 39.95), so the

---------------

 only integer in there would be 40? But 40 is 40.0, which is outside the upper bound.

---------------

 So no integer here. 

n=200: 0.3985*200=79.7, 0.3995*200=79.9. The interval is [79.7, 79.9). So possible

---------------

 integer is 80? But 80 is 80, which is above 79.9. So

---------------

 no integer here either. 

n=250: 0.3985*250 = 99.625, 0.3995*250=99.875. So the

---------------

 interval is [99.625,99.875). The integer here would be 100? 

---------------

100 is 100, which is above 99.875. So no. 

n=300: 0.3985*300 = 119.55, 0.3995*300=119.85. So interval

---------------

 is [119.55,119.85). The integer here would be 120? Again

---------------

 too high. 119.55 to 119.85, so the integer 119.55 is

---------------

 less than 120, but the integer would be 119? 119 is below 119.55? Wait

---------------

, 119.55 is the lower bound. So 119 is below that, so no integer in

---------------

 the interval. 

Hmm, so n=300 also not working. 

n=400: 0.3985*400=159.4, 0.3995*400=159.8. So the interval [159.4,159.8). The integer here

---------------

 is 159.4 to 159.8, so 159.4 is the lower bound. The integer 159 is below,

---------------

 160 is above. So no integer in the interval. 

n=500: 0.3985*500=199.25, 0.3995*500=199.75. So the interval [199.25,199.75). The integer here

---------------

 is 199.25 to 199.75, so 199 is below, 200 is above. So

---------------

 no. 

Hmm, this is frustrating. Let me try n=667. Wait, maybe there's a better

---------------

 way. 

Alternatively, let me think of the inequality 0.3985 ≤ H/n < 0.3995. Let

---------------

 me rearrange this to H = 0.399n ± some error. 

Alternatively, perhaps use continued fractions to

---------------

 approximate 0.399. 

Alternatively, let me note that 0.399 is approximately 399/1000. So

---------------

 maybe 399/1000 is the exact value, but since the average is rounded, the actual value must

---------------

 be between 0.3985 and 0.3995. 

Therefore, the fraction H/n must be in that

---------------

 interval. So, the minimal n where such a fraction exists. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of fractions close to 0.399 with

---------------

 small denominators. Let's see:

Suppose H/n is approximately 0.399. Let me see for

---------------

 n= 254, H=101: 101/254 ≈ 0.3976,

---------------

 which is below 0.3985. 

n=255: 101/255≈0.396,

---------------

 still too low. 

n=256: 101/256≈0.3945. 



---------------

Hmm, maybe I need higher H. Let's see:

Suppose n= 257: H=102.

---------------

 102/257≈0.3969. 

n=258: 102/258≈0.3953. 

Hmm

---------------

, still low. 

Wait, perhaps trying fractions where the numerator is close to 0.399 times denominator. 

Let

---------------

 me try n= 667. 0.399*667≈266.133. So H≈266. Let

---------------

's see 266/667≈0.3988. That is within the interval 0.3985 to 0.3995. 



---------------

Wait, let me compute 266 divided by 667:

266 ÷ 667. Let me compute

---------------

 this division. 

667 × 0.4 = 266.8. 

So 266 is

---------------

 0.4 - 0.008. So 266/667 is approximately 0.3988. 



---------------

Which is between 0.3985 and 0.3995. So that works. 

Wait

---------------

, so n=667 gives H=266, which is 266/667≈0.3988, which is

---------------

 within the required interval. 

Is 667 the minimal possible? Let's see if there is a smaller n.

Wait, let

---------------

 me check n= 666: 0.3985*666 ≈ 265.64

---------------

1, and 0.3995*666≈266.027. So the interval is [265.641, 266.027). So

---------------

 possible H would be 266? 266 is within that interval. Let's check 266/666.

---------------

 

266 divided by 666 is equal to 266/666 ≈ 0.3994. 



---------------

Wait, 0.3994 is just under 0.3995, so that's okay. Because

---------------

 the upper limit is less than 0.3995, so 0.3994 is acceptable. 



---------------

Wait, so 266/666 ≈ 0.3994. That's within the desired

---------------

 range. Therefore, n=666 would also work. 

Wait, so that's better. Let me check 

---------------

266/666. Let's compute exactly:

266 divided by 666: Let's divide numerator and denominator by 2: 133/333. 

3

---------------

33 × 0.4 = 133.2. So 133/333 ≈ 0.399399…

---------------

 which is approximately 0.3994. 

So that is within the interval [0.3985, 0.3995). 



---------------

Therefore, n=666 would work. 

Hmm, so that's better than 667. Let me see if there

---------------

's a smaller n. 

Let me try n= 532. 

0.3985*532 �

---------------

� 211.9, and 0.3995*532≈212.5. So the

---------------

 interval is [211.9,212.5). The integer here is 212. Let

---------------

 me check 212/532. 

212 divided by 532. Let's see

---------------

, 532 divided by 4 is 133, so 212 is 532*(212/532)= approx

---------------

 0.4, but exact calculation:

212 ÷532 = 0.3985 (

---------------

exactly?) Let me compute 212/532:

Divide numerator and denominator by 4: 53/133. 

53 divided

---------------

 by 133: 133 ×0.4=53.2. So 53 is 0.4 -0.0015.

---------------

 So approximately 0.39848. 

Which is just below 0.3985. So

---------------

 that would be 0.39848, which is below the required lower bound of 0.3985. So

---------------

 that's not acceptable. 

Hmm. Close but not enough. 

Trying n= 665. 

0.3985*665≈

---------------

265. 0325, and 0.3995*665≈265.6675. So interval is [265.0325, 265.6675). The

---------------

 integer here would be 265. Let me check 265/665. 

265 divided by 665:

---------------

 divide numerator and denominator by 5: 53/133 ≈0.39848.

---------------

 Same as before. So again, below the lower bound. 

Hmm. 

n= 665 gives H=265,

---------------

 which is 265/665 ≈0.39848, which is below 0.3985. So

---------------

 not good. 

n=664:

0.3985*664= 0.3985*

---------------

600=239.1; 0.3985*64≈25.504 →

---------------

 total ≈239.1+25.5=264.6. 

0.3995*664≈

---------------

0.3995*(600+64)= 239.7 + 25.568= 265.268. 

So interval is [264.6, 265.268). So

---------------

 H=265. 

265/664 ≈ 0.3988. Let me compute exactly

---------------

:

265/664. Let's divide numerator and denominator by common factors. Let's see, 265 divides

---------------

 by 5: 53. 664 divided by 4 is 166, so 5

---------------

3 and 166 have a common factor? 53 is prime, 166 is 2×83. So no. So 265/664=

---------------

53/132.8? Wait, no, better to compute decimal:

265 divided by 664.

---------------

 Let me do the division:

664 goes into 2650 (adding decimal) 3 times (3×664=1992), subtract:

---------------

 2650-1992=658. Bring down a zero: 6580. 664×9=5976. Subtract: 6580-5976=604. Bring down zero: 6040. 664×9=5976 again. So

---------------

 6040-5976=64. So up to now, 0.399...

---------------

 So approximately 0.3990. 

So 0.3990 is within [0.3985,0.3995). So

---------------

 yes, 265/664≈0.3990. So that works. 

So n=664.

---------------

 

Wait, so that's better. 

Wait, let me check 265/664:

Let me do exact

---------------

 division:

265 divided by 664. Let's see:

664 × 0.4 = 265.6. So 265 is 0.4 minus 0.6/

---------------

664? Wait, no. 

Wait, 0.4 would be 265.6, so 265 is 0.4 - (0.6/664). 



---------------

Wait, perhaps better to write as:

265/664 = (265.6 - 0.6)/664 = 0.4 - 0.6/664 ≈0.4 -0.0009≈

---------------

0.3991. So approximately 0.3991. 

So that's within the interval. 

Therefore, n=664 works

---------------

. 

Is there a smaller n?

Let me try n= 663:

0.3985×663≈

---------------

0.3985×600=239.1; 0.3985×63≈25.10

---------------

55 → total≈239.1+25.1055=264.2055.

---------------

 

0.3995×663≈0.3995×600=239.7; 0.3995×63≈25.1685 → total≈239.7+25.1685≈264.8685. 

So interval [264.2055, 264.8685). So

---------------

 possible H is 264 or 265? 264.2 to 264.86

---------------

, so H=264 or 265? Wait, 264 is within the lower part,

---------------

 but 264.2055 ≤ H <264.8685. So H must

---------------

 be 264.2055 ≤ H <264.8685. Since H must be integer, H

---------------

=264 or 265? 

Wait 264.2055 ≤ H <264.8685 →

---------------

 H can be 265? Wait, 265 is 265, which is greater than 264.8685? 

---------------

264.8685 is less than 265? Wait, 264.8685 is less

---------------

 than 265, so H can only be 264 or 265? Wait, no,

---------------

 H must be less than 264.8685. So H can only be 264.

---------------

 

Wait, 264.2055 ≤ H <264.8685 → H

---------------

 must be 264 because 264.2055 ≤264 <264.8685?

---------------

 Wait, no, 264 is less than 264.2055? Wait, no,

---------------

 264 is less than 264.2055. So actually, the interval [264.2055, 264.8685). The

---------------

 integers in this interval would be 265 is too big, because 264.8685 is less than 265. So

---------------

 there is no integer in that interval. Because the lower bound is ~264.2 and upper ~264.8685. So the

---------------

 only integer in that interval would be 264. But 264 is below the lower bound? Wait,

---------------

 264 is less than 264.2055? 264 is 264.0, which is less than 264.2055. Therefore, there

---------------

 is no integer H in that interval. So n=663 does not work. 

So n=664 works.

---------------

 Let me check n= 662:

0.3985×662 ≈0.3985×600=239.1; 0.3985×62≈24.697 → total≈239.1+24.697=263.797. 

0.3995×662≈0.3995×600=239.7; 0.3995×62≈24.769 → total≈239.7+24.769≈264.469. 

Interval

---------------

 is [263.797, 264.469). So possible H is 264. 



---------------

Check 264/662. Let me compute that:

264 divided by 662. Let's see:



---------------

Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 132/331. 

331×0.4 =132.4. So 132/331 is

---------------

 0.3988 approximately. 

Compute 132/331:

331 ×0.398=

---------------

 131.858. Hmm, 0.398×331≈131.858, so 132 is 131.858+0.142,

---------------

 so 0.398 + (0.142/331)≈0.398 +0.00043≈0.39843. 



---------------

Which is below 0.3985. So 264/662≈0.3984,

---------------

 which is below the lower bound. Therefore, not acceptable. 

Hmm. 

n= 661:

0.3985×661≈0.3985×600=239.1; 0.3985×61≈24.2985 → total≈263.3985. 

0.3995×661≈0.3995×600=239.7; 0.3995×61≈24.3695 → total≈264.0695. 

Interval [263.3985, 264.0695). So

---------------

 H can be 264. 

Check 264/661. Let's compute:

264 divided

---------------

 by 661. 

661×0.4=264.4. So 264 is 0.4 minus 0.4/661≈

---------------

0.39924. 

Wait, 264/661 = (264.4 -0.4)/661 =0.4 -0.4/661≈0.4 -0.0006≈0.3994. 

Wait, let

---------------

 me do exact division:

264 divided by 661:

661 into 264.00

---------------

00...

661 goes into 2640 (after decimal) 3 times (3×661=1983), subtract 

---------------

1983 from 2640 → 657. Bring down 0: 6570. 

661×9=5949. Subtract from 6570: 621. Bring down 0: 6210. 

661×9=5949 again

---------------

. Subtract: 6210-5949=261. Bring down 0: 2610. 

661×3=1983. Subtract: 2610-1983=627. 



---------------

So up to now, 0.3993... So approximately 0.3993. Which is within the interval. 

Wait, so

---------------

 264/661≈0.3993. 

Wait, but let me confirm:

2

---------------

64 divided by 661:

If 661 × 0.399 = 661*(

---------------

0.4 -0.001)=264.4 -0.661=263.739. 

So

---------------

 264 is 263.739 +0.261, so 0.399 + 0.261/661≈0.399+0.000395≈0.3994. So approximately

---------------

 0.3994. 

Therefore, 0.3994 is within [0.3985,0.3995). Therefore

---------------

, n=661 works. 

So that's better than 664. 

Wait, so n=661 works

---------------

. 

Hmm, so let's see if even smaller n works. 

n= 660:

0.3985×660=0.3985×600 +0.3985×60=239.1 +23.91=263.01

0.3995×660=0.3995×600 +0.3995×60=239.7 +23.97=263.67. 

So

---------------

 interval [263.01, 263.67). 

So possible H is 263. 

Check 263/660.

---------------

 Let's compute:

263 divided by 660. 

Divide numerator and denominator by common factors? 263 is a prime? Maybe

---------------

. 

263/660 ≈0.3985. Let me compute 263/

---------------

660:

660×0.4=264. So 263 is 0.4 -1

---------------

/660≈0.39848. 

Which is just below 0.3985. 



---------------

So, 0.39848 is below the lower bound. 

Thus, n=660 does

---------------

 not work. 

n=659:

0.3985×659≈0.3985×600=239.1 +0.3985×59≈23.5115 → total≈262.6115



---------------

0.3995×659≈0.3995×600=239.7 +0.3995×59≈23.5605 → total≈263.2605

Interval [262.6115, 263.2605). So

---------------

 possible H=263. 

Check 263/659:

Let me compute:

659×0.4=263.6, so 263 is 0.4 -0.6/659≈0.3991. 

Wait

---------------

, 263/659: 

Compute 263 divided by 659. 

6

---------------

59 into 2630 (after decimal):

659×3=1977. Subtract from 2630: 653. Bring down 0: 6530. 

659×9=5931. Subtract: 6530-5931=599. Bring down 0: 5990. 

659×9=5931 again. Subtract: 5990-5931=59. 

So up

---------------

 to now, 0.399... So approximately 0.3991. 

Which is within the interval. 

So

---------------

 263/659≈0.3991. So that works. 

Therefore, n=659 is acceptable

---------------

. 

Hmm, so even smaller. 

Continuing this process is tedious, but maybe I can see a pattern. Let's see

---------------

:

n=659 works. Let's check n= 658:

0.3985×658≈0.3985×600=239.1 +0.3985×58≈23.013 → total≈262.113

0.3995×658≈0.3995×600=239.7 +0.3995×58≈23.061 → total≈262.761

Interval [262.113, 262.761). So

---------------

 possible H=262 or 263? 

262.113 ≤ H <262.761 → H must

---------------

 be 262. 

Check 262/658. 

262 divided by 658. 



---------------

Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 131/329. 

329×0.4=131.6. So 131/329≈

---------------

0.3981. 

Which is below 0.3985. 

Thus, n=658 doesn

---------------

't work. 

n=657:

0.3985×657≈0.3985×600=239.1 +0.3985×57≈22.7145 → total≈261.8145

0.3995×657≈0.3995×600=239.7 +0.3995×57≈22.7715 → total≈262.4715

Interval [261.8145, 262.4715). So

---------------

 H=262. 

262/657. Let me compute:

657×0.4=262.8. So 262 is 0.4 -0.8/657≈0.3988

---------------

. 

So approximately 0.3988, which is within the interval. 

Therefore, n=657 works. 

Hmm

---------------

, even smaller. 

Continuing:

n=656:

0.3985×656≈239.1 +0.3985×56≈22.316 → total≈261.416

0.3995×656≈239.7 +0.3995×56≈22.372 → total≈262.072

Interval [261.416, 262.072). So H=262.

---------------

 

262/656. Let's compute:

Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 131/328. 

328×0.4=131.2. So 131/328≈0.3994. 

So

---------------

 0.3994 is within the interval. 

Thus, n=656 works. 

n=655:

0.3985×655≈239.1 +0.3985×55≈21.9175 → total≈261.0175

0.3995×655≈239.7 +0.3995×55≈21.9725 → total≈261.6725

Interval [261.0175,261.6725). So H=261 or 262? 

2

---------------

61.0175 ≤ H <261.6725. So H must be 261. 

Check 261/655.

---------------

 

Compute 261 divided by 655. 

655×0.4=262. So 261 is 0.4 -1/655≈0.39848

---------------

. 

Which is just below 0.3985. So not acceptable. 

Thus, n=655 doesn

---------------

't work. 

n=654:

0.3985×654≈239.1 +0.3985×54≈21.519 → total≈260.619

0.3995×654≈239.7 +0.3995×54≈21.573 → total≈261.273

Interval [260.619,261.273). H=261. 

261/654.

---------------

 Let me compute:

Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 87/218. 

218×0.4=87.2. So 87/218≈0.39908. 

Which

---------------

 is within the interval. 

Therefore, n=654 works. 

Hmm, so n=654 works

---------------

. 

Continuing:

n=653:

0.3985×653≈239.1 +0.3985×53≈21.1205 → total≈260.2205

0.3995×653≈239.7 +0.3995×53≈21.1735 → total≈260.8735

Interval [260.2205,260.8735). H=260 or 261?

---------------

 

260.2205 ≤ H <260.8735. So H must be 260. 

Check 260/653.

---------------

 

260 divided by 653. 

653×0.4=261.2. So 260 is 0.4 -1.2/653≈0.3982

---------------

. 

Below 0.3985. 

Thus, n=653 doesn't work. 

n=652:

Interval [259.822,260.474). H=260. 

260/652.

---------------

 Divide numerator and denominator by 4: 65/163. 

163×0.4=65.2. So 65/163≈0.39877. 

Which

---------------

 is within the interval. 

Thus, n=652 works. 

Continuing:

3. 

Which is within the interval. 

Thus, n=651 works. 

n=650:

0.3985×650=0.3985×600 +0.3985×50=239.1 +19.925=259.025

0.3995×650=239.7 +19.975=259.675

Interval [259.025,259.675). H=259. 

259 divided by 650.

 no. 

Thus, n=650 doesn't work.

258.228 ≤ H <258.876 → H must be 258 or 259? 

258 is below

---------------

 the lower bound (258.228), so H=259? 

259 is within

---------------

 the interval? 259 <258.876? No, 259 is higher than 258.876. 



---------------

Wait, 258.876 is approximately 258.876, so 259 is 

---------------

259.0, which is above. 

Thus, no integer in the interval. 

Thus, n=648 doesn't work.

 is getting really tedious, but I see a pattern here where every few numbers, there's a valid n. Let me try

 so no. 

Thus, no H in interval. 

n=637:

Thus, n=627 works. 

Hmm

---------------

---------------

 if even smaller n work. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can use continued fractions or another method. 

Alternatively, the problem is

 similar to finding the minimal denominator such that the fraction H/n is in [0.3985, 0.3995). 

Alternatively

Wait, perhaps there's a better way. Let me think

---------------

 of fractions with denominator n and numerator H such that 0.3985n ≤ H <0.3995n. 

Let

---------------

 me rearrange this as H = round(0.399n). So, H must be the nearest integer to 0.399n, but within

---------------

 the interval. 

Alternatively, let me set H = floor(0.3995n) and check if it

Divide numerator and denominator by 6: 41/103≈0.39805.

305 ×0.4=122. So 122/305=0.4 exactly? Wait, no.

---------------

 0.4×305=122. So yes, 122/305=0.4. 



---------------

Wait, but 0.4 is 0.4000, which is above the upper bound of 0.3995. 



---------------

Oh! Wait, the upper bound is less than 0.3995. So 0.4 is too

---------------

 high. 

Therefore, 122/305=0.4 is not less than 0.3995. 



---------------

Thus, it's outside the interval. 

Therefore, n=305 doesn't work. 

Hmm, so I

Interval [121.136,121.748). H=121.

But 80 is above 79.7005? 80>79.7005,

Thus, no H in interval. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, perhaps n= 199 is

---------------

 too low. 

Alternatively, going back to n= 617, which worked. 

Continuing down to n= 6

---------------

00:

Wait, tried n=600 earlier. 

n=600 gives H=239.4

239/600≈0.3983.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal n is 617.

 Let me check n= 317 again. 

Wait, n= 317 gives H=159,

 but 159/317≈0.4984? Wait no, 159 divided by 317:

Wait, 317×0.5=158.5, so 159 is 0.5 +0.5/317≈0.50158

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate:

Wait for n=317:

Wait

---------------

, so H must be between ~126.3245 and ~126.6415. So

---------------

 H=126 or 127? 

126.3245 ≤ H <126.6415 → H must be 126 or

---------------

 127? 

126 is below the lower bound, so H=127? 

Wait, 127 is above

---------------

 upper bound? 126.6415 is less than 127? 

Yes, so no

---------------

 integer H in the interval. 

Thus, n=317 doesn't work. 

Okay, so returning to n

244 is below lower bound, so H=245? 245 is

 above upper bound (244.8985). 

Thus, no. 

n=612:

0.3995×612≈244.494

Interval [243.912,244.494). H=244. 

244 divided by 612. 

Divide numerator and denominator by 4: 61/153.

222 is below, 223 is above. 

Thus, no. 

n=557:

0.3985×557≈221.9245

0.3995×557≈221.8945 → 

0.3995×557=0.3995×500 +0.3995×57=199.75 +22.7665≈222.5165

Interval [221.9245,222.5165). H=222. 

222 divided by 557. 

557×0.4=222.8. So 222 is 0.4 -0.8/557≈0.3985. 

Within

---------------

 interval. 

Thus, n=557 works. 

Continuing down:

n=556:

0.3985×556≈221.526

0.3995×556≈221.486 → 

0.3995×556=0.3995×500 +0.3995×56=199.75 +22.368≈222.118

Interval [221.526,222.118). H=222. 

222 divided by 556≈0.3993. 

Within interval. 

Thus, n=556 works. 

Contin

---------------

uing down, n=556 works. 

Continuing this process, it seems the minimal n is getting lower and

---------------

 lower, but I need to find the smallest possible. 

Let me try to find a pattern or formula. 

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 the minimal n is 627, but I'm not sure. 

Wait, let's consider that the minimal n is

---------------

 when the interval [0.3985n,0.3995n) contains an integer H. 



---------------

The length of the interval is 0.001n. To have at least one integer in the interval, the length must be at

---------------

 least 1, so n >=1000. But we already found smaller n's, so that's not the

---------------

 case. 

Alternatively, the minimal n is the minimal denominator where the fraction H/n is in [0.3985,0.3995). 

This

---------------

 is similar to finding the minimal denominator for a fraction in that interval. 

The minimal denominator would be related to the Farey sequence or continued fractions. 

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 the minimal n is 627, but I need to check further. 

Alternatively, let me try n= 6

---------------

27:

0.3985×627≈248.3195

0.3995×627≈248.9

---------------

465

Interval [248.3195,248.9465). H=248 or 249? 

248 is below, 249 is above

---------------

? 

248.3195 ≤ H <248.9465 → H must be 248 or 249? 

248.3195 ≤

---------------

249 <248.9465? No, 249 is above the upper bound. 

Wait

---------------

, 248.9465 is less than 249. 

Thus, H=248 is

---------------

 below, so no integer in the interval. 

Wait, this contradicts my previous calculation. 

Wait, perhaps I made an error.

---------------

 

Wait, 0.3985×627:

0.3985 ×600=239.1,

---------------

 0.3985×27≈10.7595 → total≈250. 



---------------

Wait, my mistake earlier. Let me recalculate n=627:

Wait, 0.3985×627:



---------------

Let me compute 627×0.3985:

627 ×0.4 =250.8 



---------------

Minus 627 ×0.0015=0.9405 

So 250.8 -0.9405≈249.8595 

Similarly

---------------

, 0.3995×627:

627×0.4=250.8 

Plus 627×0.0005=0.3135 

Total

---------------

≈250.8+0.3135≈251.1135 

Thus, the interval is [249.8595,251.1135). 



---------------

Thus, H can be 250 or 251. 

250 divided by 627≈0.3987. 

2

---------------

51 divided by 627≈0.4003. 

Thus, H=250 gives

---------------

 250/627≈0.3987 which is within the interval. 

Thus, n=627 works. 

Wait

---------------

, my previous calculation was wrong because I miscalculated the multiplication. 

Thus, n=627 works. 

Contin

---------------

uing down, perhaps the minimal n is 627? 

Wait, let me try n= 617:



---------------

0.3985×617≈245.9145

0.3995×617≈246.4985

Interval [245.9145,246.4985). H=246. 

246 divided by 617≈0.3987. 

Within

---------------

 interval. 

Thus, n=617 works. 

Continuing down to n= 317 doesn't work, but n= 30

---------------

Wait, let me try n= 600:

No, it didn't work. 

Wait

---------------

, let me try n= 617 and n= 616 works. 

Continuing to n= 6

---------------

00, but no. 

Continuing down to n= 399, no. 

Hmm, perhaps the minimal n is 305 but

---------------

 that didn't work. 

Wait, let me try n= 600:

0.3985×600=239.1,

---------------

 0.3995×600=239.7. 

Thus, interval [239.1,239.7). H=239. 

239/600≈0.3983.

Thus, no. 

Hmm. 

Continuing down to n= 305 didn't work. 

The

---------------

 smallest n I can find so far is 305 didn't work, but n= 305 gives

Wait, let me try n= 305:

Wait, 0.3985×305≈121.5425



---------------

0.3995×305≈122.2975

Interval [121.5425,122.2975). H=122. 

122/305=0.4 exactly

, which is over the upper limit. 

Thus, no. 

Hmm. 

Continuing down to n= 6

0.3995×306=0.3995*300 +0.3995*6=119.85 +2.397=122.247

Interval [121.941,122.247). So H=122 is within the

122 divided by 306 is 122/306=61/153≈0.3987.
