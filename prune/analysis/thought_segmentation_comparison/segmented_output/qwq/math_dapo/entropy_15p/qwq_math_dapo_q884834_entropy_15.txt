Okay, let me see. So there's this problem about cards in a box, and I need to find the probability that the other side is red given that I see a red side. Hmm, sounds

---------------

 like a conditional probability question. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me get all the details straight. The box has six cards:

- Three cards are black on both sides (so both sides are black).
- One card is black on one side and red on the other.
- Two cards are red on both sides.

We pick a card at random and then look at one side, which turns out to be red. We need the probability that the other side is also red. 

Alright

---------------

, so since it's a conditional probability problem, maybe I should use Bayes' theorem here. But let me think in

---------------

 terms of possible outcomes.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to consider all the possible sides and count the favorable ones. Since we're picking a card and then a side, the

---------------

 sample space might be all the sides of all the cards. Let me try that approach.

First, let me figure out how many sides there are in total. Each card has two sides, so 6 cards ×

---------------

 2 = 12 sides. But maybe it's better to count the number of red and black sides.

Wait, let

---------------

's do it properly. Let's list out all the cards and their sides:

1. Card 1: Black, Black
2. Card 2: Black, Black
3. Card 3: Black, Black
4. Card 4: Black, Red
5. Card 5: Red, Red
6. Card 6: Red, Red

So,

---------------

 for each card:

- The first three cards (1-3) have two black sides each. So total black sides from these: 3×

---------------

2=6.
- Card 4 has one black and one red side. So that's 1 black and 1 red.
- Cards 5 and 6 are both red on both sides, so each contributes two red sides. So that

---------------

's 2×2=4 red sides from those.

Total red sides: 1 (from card 4) + 4 (from cards 5 and 6) = 5 red sides.

Total black sides: 6 (from first three) +1 (from card 4) =7 black sides. 



---------------

Total sides: 12, which checks out (6 cards × 2 sides =12). 

Now, the problem states that we picked a card at random, then a random side, and that side is red. So, given that we've

---------------

 observed a red side, what is the probability that the other side of the same card is also red?

Hmm. So,

---------------

 perhaps the way to approach this is: among all the red sides, how many of them have a red on the other side? The

---------------

 probability would then be the number of such favorable red sides divided by the total number of red sides.

Wait, that makes sense. Because when we pick a card and a side at random, each side is equally likely. Since there

---------------

 are 12 sides, each side has a 1/12 chance of being selected. So, given that the selected side is red (so

---------------

 we're in the subset of red sides), the probability is the number of red sides that have red on the other side divided by total red sides.

Let

---------------

 me confirm that approach. Since the selection is uniform over the sides, yes. So, the probability is (number of red sides with

---------------

 red on the other side) divided by (total red sides). 

So, let's count the red sides that have red on the other side. 



---------------

Looking at the red sides:

- The two red-red cards (cards 5 and 6) each have two red sides. So each of their red sides has another red side on the reverse

---------------

. So for each of these 4 red sides, the other side is red. 

- The black-red card (card 4) has one red side, which

---------------

 has a black side on the other. So that red side does not have red on the other side.

Therefore, the number of red sides with red on the other side is 4 (from the two red-red cards),

---------------

 and the total red sides are 5 (4 from red-red cards plus 1 from the black-red card). 

Therefore

---------------

, the probability is 4/5. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let

---------------

 me recheck:

Total red sides:

Cards 5 and 6 are both red-red, so each has 2 red sides, so 2×2=4?

---------------

 Wait, no. Wait, there are two cards that are red-red. Each has two red sides, so that's 2×

---------------

2=4 red sides. Then the black-red card (card 4) has one red side. So total red sides are 4+1=5. That

---------------

's correct.

Of those 5 red sides, how many have red on the other side? The red sides from the red-red cards: each of those red

---------------

 sides has another red side. So all 4 of those. The red side from the black-red card has a black on the other. So yes

---------------

, 4 out of 5. 

Therefore, the probability is 4/5. 

Wait, but hold on.

---------------

 The problem says "you pick a card uniformly at random from the box and look at a random side." So is this equivalent to selecting

---------------

 a side uniformly at random? Because when you pick a card uniformly at random (so each card has 1/6 chance) and then pick a side uniformly at random (each side has 1/2 chance),

---------------

 then the probability of selecting any particular side is (1/6)*(1/2)=1/12, same as if

---------------

 you selected a side uniformly from all 12 sides. So yes, the two approaches are equivalent. 

Therefore, the answer should be 4/5, so m=4, n=5, so

---------------

 m + n=9. 

Wait, but let me think again. Because sometimes in probability problems, especially with cards, there can be a

---------------

 gotcha. Let me try another approach using Bayes theorem to confirm.

Let me denote the events:

Let A be the event that the card is a red-red card.

Let B be the event that the card is the black-red card.

Let C be the event that the card is a black-black card.

But perhaps

---------------

 better to frame the problem in terms of the desired probability.

We need P(other side is red | observed side is red).

Alternatively, the

---------------

 probability that the card is a red-red card given that we observed a red side. 

Because if the card is red-red, then the other side is red. If it's black-red, the other is black. So,

---------------

 the problem reduces to finding the probability that the card is a red-red card given that we saw a red side. 

So

---------------

, applying Bayes' theorem here:

P(Red-Red card | red side) = P(red side | Red-Red card) * P(Red-Red card) / P(red side)

First, compute each term.

P(Red-Red card) is the prior probability of picking a red-red card. There are two red-red cards out of six, so 2/6 = 1/3.

P(red side | Red-Red card) is 1, since both sides are red. So given

---------------

 that the card is red-red, any side you pick is red.

P(red side) is the total probability of seeing a red side, which can be calculated as:

Total red sides / total sides, which is 5/12 as

---------------

 before. Wait, but let me compute it using the law of total probability.

P(red side) = P(red side | Red-Red) * P(Red-Red) + P(red side | Black-Red) * P(Black-Red) + P(red side | Black-Black)*P(Black-Black)

So

---------------

:

= 1*(2/6) + (1/2)*(1/6) + 0*(3/6)

Because

---------------

:

- For Red-Red cards: probability of red side is 1, and there are 2 such cards out of 6.

- For Black-Red card: probability of red side is 1/2 (since one side is red, one is black), and it's 1 card out of 6.

- For Black-Black cards: probability of red side is 0, and there are 3 such cards out of 6.

Calcul

---------------

ating this:

1*(2/6) = 2/6

1/2*(1/6) = 1/12

0*(3/6)=0

Total P(red side) = 2/6 + 1/12 = (4/12 + 1/12) = 5/12. Which matches the previous count

---------------

.

Therefore, applying Bayes' theorem:

P(Red-Red | red side) = (1 * 2/6) / (5/12) = (2/6) / (5/12) 

Simplify numerator and denominator:

2/6 is 1/3. 

---------------

1/3 divided by 5/12 is (1/3)*(12/5) = 4/5. 

Same result. So that confirms it. 



---------------

Therefore, the probability is 4/5, so m + n is 4 +5=9. 

Hmm, seems

---------------

 like that's the answer. Let me check again in case I missed something. 

Wait, another way to think: when

---------------

 you pick a card and a side, and see red, the possible scenarios are the 5 red sides. Out of those, 4 lead to the other side being red. So 

---------------

4/5. 

Yes, that's the same as before. 

Alternatively, if someone gets confused between counting cards vs. sides, they might make

---------------

 a mistake. For example, if someone says there are 2 red-red cards, 1 black-red, and 3 black-black. Given

---------------

 that you saw red, so you must have picked either a red-red or black-red card. So probability is 2/(2+1)=2/3. But that's wrong because it doesn't account for the number of red sides. 



---------------

Ah, right, that's a common mistake. Because the black-red card only has one red side, while each red-red card has two. So the probability

---------------

 should weight by the number of red sides each contributes. So the correct way is indeed 4/5. 

Therefore, I think the

---------------

 answer is 4/5, so 4+5=9.

**Final Answer**
Answer: 9


Given a box containing six cards: three black on both sides, one black on one side and red on the other, and two red on both sides, we need to find the probability that the other side is red given that a randomly picked side is red.

First, we count the total number of red sides:
- The three black-black cards contribute 0 red sides.
- The one black-red card contributes 1 red side.
- The two red-red cards contribute 4 red sides (2 sides per card × 2 cards).

Thus, there are \(0 + 1 + 4 = 5\) red sides in total.

Next, we determine how many of these red sides have a red on the other side:
- The red sides of the two red-red cards each have a red on the other side, contributing 4 red sides.
- The red side of the black-red card has a black on the other side.

Therefore, there are 4 favorable red sides out of 5 total red sides.

The probability is thus

---------------

 \(\frac{4}{5}\). Expressing this as a common fraction, we have \(m = 4\) and \(n = 5\), so \(m + n = 4 + 5 = 9\).

\[
\boxed{9}
