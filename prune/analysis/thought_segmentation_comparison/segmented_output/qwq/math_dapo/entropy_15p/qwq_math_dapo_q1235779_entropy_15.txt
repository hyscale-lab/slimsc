Okay, let's see. I need to find a number in this matrix that is both the largest in its column and the smallest in its row. Hmm, so

---------------

 the problem is asking for a number that satisfies two conditions: first, it has to be the smallest in its own row, and second, it has to be the largest in its own column. 



---------------

Let me start by recalling that rows go from left to right, and columns go up and down. The matrix given here has 5 columns and 5 rows,

---------------

 but wait, looking at the matrix:

First row: 10, 6, 4, 3, 2  


---------------

Second row: 11,7,14,10,8  
Third row:8,3,4,5,9  
Fourth row:13,4,15,12,1  
Fifth row:8,2,5,9,3  

Wait, actually, let

---------------

 me count again. The problem says "the array" and the matrix is written with 5 rows each. Each row has 5 numbers, so it

---------------

's a 5x5 matrix. So rows are horizontal, columns are vertical. Each element is in a specific row and column. 

So the

---------------

 task is to find an element that is the smallest in its row, but also the largest in its column. Since it's the smallest in its row, it has to be less than or equal to all other elements in that row. But

---------------

 at the same time, it has to be the largest in its column, meaning it has to be greater than or equal to all other elements in that column. 

So

---------------

, to approach this, maybe I can first list for each row the minimum element (since we need the smallest in its row), and then check if that minimum element is also the maximum in its column. Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps I can check each element in the matrix to see if it meets both criteria. 

Let me think. Let's first

---------------

 go row by row, find the minimum in each row, and note their positions (row and column). Then, for each of these minima, check if they are the maximum in their respective columns. 

Starting

---------------

 with the first row: 10, 6, 4, 3, 2. The smallest here is 2, which is in column 5. Now, is

---------------

 2 the largest in column 5? Let's check column 5. The elements in column 5 are 2 (from first row), 8 (second row), 9 (third row), 1 (fourth row), and 3 (fifth row). The largest in column 5 is 9, which is in the third row. So 2 is not the maximum in its column. So 

---------------

2 is out. 

Second row: 11, 7,14,10,8. The smallest here is 7, which is in column 2. Now, check column 2. Column 2 has elements 6 (row1), 7 (row2), 3 (row3), 4 (row4), 2 (row5). The largest in column 2 is 7.

---------------

 Because 7 is the highest in column 2. Wait, 7 is in row2, column2. So 

---------------

7 is the minimum of its row (second row's minimum is 7?) Wait, let's check again. The second row elements

---------------

: 11,7,14,10,8. The smallest is 7, yes. Then,

---------------

 column2's elements are 6,7,3,4,2. The maximum in column2 is indeed 7. So 

---------------

7 is both the smallest in its row and the largest in its column. Hmm, so that could be a candidate. But

---------------

 let's check the other rows to make sure there isn't another one. 

Third row: 8,3,4,5,9. The minimum here is 3, which is in column2. Wait

---------------

, column2's maximum was already 7, so 3 is not the maximum in column2. So that's out. 

Fourth row:13,4,15,12,1. The minimum here is 1, column

---------------

5. But column5's maximum was 9, so 1 is not the maximum. 

Fifth row:8,2,5,9,3. The minimum here is 2, column2. Again

---------------

, column2's maximum is 7, so 2 is not the maximum. 

Wait, so only the second row's minimum (7) is the maximum in its column. So

---------------

 that would be the answer? But let me check again. 

Wait, let me double-check each step. 

First row's minimum is 2 in

---------------

 column5. Column5's max is 9, so no. 

Second row's minimum is 7 in column2. Column2's elements: first

---------------

 element 6, then 7, then 3,4,2. So yes, 7 is the maximum in

---------------

 column2. So 7 is a candidate. 

Third row's minimum is 3 (column2). But column2's max is 7, so no

---------------

. 

Fourth row's minimum is 1 (column5). Column5's max is 9, so no. 

Fifth row's minimum is 2 (column2). Again, column2's max is 7, so no. 

Therefore

---------------

, the only number that satisfies both conditions is 7. 

Wait, but let me check again if there might be another number

---------------

 that I missed. Maybe I made a mistake in considering the rows. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach it the other way: For

---------------

 each column, find the maximum, and see if that maximum is the minimum in its row. 

Let me try that approach

---------------

 as a cross-check. 

Columns: 

Column1: elements 10,11,8,13,8. The maximum here is 13 (fourth row, column1). Now, check if 13 is the smallest in its row (fourth row: 13,4,15,12,1). The smallest

---------------

 in the fourth row is 1, so 13 is not the minimum in its row. 

Column2: elements 6,7,3,4,2. The maximum is 7 (second row, column2). The

---------------

 second row's elements: 11,7,14,10,8. The minimum in that row is 7, so yes, that

---------------

's the same as before. 

Column3: elements 4,14,4,15,5. The maximum here is 15 (fourth row, column3). Now

---------------

, check the fourth row. The elements are 13,4,15,12,1. The minimum in the fourth row is 1, so 15 is not the minimum.

---------------

 

Column4: elements 3,10,5,12,9. The maximum here is 12 (fourth row, column4). The fourth row's minimum is 1, so no. 

Column5: elements 2,8,9,1,3. The maximum here is 9 (third row, column5). The

---------------

 third row's elements are 8,3,4,5,9. The minimum in that row is 3, so 9 is not the minimum in its row. 

So the

---------------

 only candidate here is again 7. 

Therefore, both approaches confirm that 7 is the number that is both the smallest in its row and the largest in its column. 

Hmm

---------------

, so I think that must be the answer. But let me check once more each step for errors. 

First row's

---------------

 min is definitely 2, which is in column5. Column5's max is 9. 

Second row's min is 7,

---------------

 which is in column2. Column2's elements: 6,7,3,4,2. The max there is 7, correct

---------------

. 

Third row's min is 3 (column2). Column2's max is 7, so no. 

Fourth row's min is 1 (column5), which

---------------

 is way below the column max. 

Fifth row's min is 2 (column2). 

So yes, only

---------------

 7. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the second row? Let me confirm the elements of the second row again: 11,7,14,10,8. The numbers are

---------------

 11,7,14,10,8. The smallest is indeed 7. 

Therefore, I

---------------

 think the answer is 7. 

Wait, but let me check another possibility. Let me go through each element in the matrix and see if any other element

---------------

 could satisfy both conditions. 

Take the first row:

10: Is it the smallest in its row? No, because

---------------

 there are smaller numbers like 6, etc. 

6: Not the smallest in row. 

4: Not the smallest. 

3: Not the smallest.

---------------

 

2: It is the smallest in its row, but as we saw, not the column max. 

Second row:



---------------

11: Not the smallest in row. 

7: smallest in row, and column max. 

14: Not the smallest. 

10: Not the smallest. 

8: Not the smallest. 

Third row:

8: Not the smallest.

---------------

 

3: the smallest (3), but in column2, which max is 7. 

4: Not the smallest. 

5: Not the smallest. 

9: Not the smallest. 

Fourth row:

13: Not the smallest. 

4: Not the smallest (the

---------------

 min is 1). 

15: Not the smallest. 

12: Not the smallest. 

1: smallest

---------------

, but not column max. 

Fifth row:

8: Not the smallest. 

2: smallest in row, but column2's max is 7. 

5: Not the smallest. 

9: Not the smallest. 

3: Not the smallest. 

So,

---------------

 indeed, the only element that meets both criteria is 7. 

Therefore, the answer should be 7. 

**Final Answer**
Answer: 7


To solve the problem of finding a number that is both the largest in its column and the smallest in its row, we analyze each row and column step by step.

1. **First Row**: The elements are \(10, 6, 4, 3, 2\). The smallest element is \(2\) (column 5). Checking column 5, the elements are \(2, 8, 9, 1, 3\). The largest element in column 5 is \(9\), so \(2\) is not the largest in its column.

2. **Second Row**: The elements are \(11, 7, 14, 10, 8\). The smallest element is \(7\) (column 2). Checking column 2, the elements are \(6, 7, 3, 4, 2\). The largest element in column 2 is \(7\), so \(7\) is both the smallest in its row and the largest in its column.

3. **Third Row**: The elements are \(8, 3, 4, 5, 9\). The smallest element is \(3\) (column 2). Checking

---------------

 column 2 again, the largest element is \(7\), so \(3\) is not the largest in its column.

4. **Fourth Row**: The elements are \(13, 4, 15, 12, 1\). The smallest element is \(1\) (column 5). Checking column 5, the largest element is \(9\), so \(1\) is not the largest in its column.

5. **Fifth Row**: The elements are \(8, 2, 5, 9, 3\). The smallest element is \(2\) (column 2). Checking column 2 again, the largest element is \(7\), so \(2\) is not the largest in its column.

After verifying all rows and columns, the only number that satisfies both conditions is \(7\).
