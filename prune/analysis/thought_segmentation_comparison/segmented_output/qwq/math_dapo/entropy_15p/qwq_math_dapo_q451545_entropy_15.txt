Okay, let's see. The problem is asking for the least positive integer n such that the product of any n odd consecutive positive integers is divisible by 45. Hmm, right

---------------

. So I need to find the smallest n where no matter which n odd numbers you pick in a row, their product will be a multiple of 45. 

First, let me recall that 45 factors into prime factors as 3² × 5. So,

---------------

 the product needs to have at least two 3s and one 5 in its prime factors. Since we're dealing with consecutive odd integers, maybe

---------------

 I need to ensure that in any such sequence, there are enough multiples of 3 and 5?

Wait, but they

---------------

 are consecutive odd integers, so the numbers are like 1, 3, 5, 7, 9,... So

---------------

 each step increases by 2. So for example, three consecutive odd integers could be 3,5,7 or 5,7,9, etc. 

So

---------------

, to have the product divisible by 45, the product must have at least two factors of 3 and one factor of 5. Let

---------------

 me think about how to guarantee that in any such sequence of n terms.

First, let's tackle the divisibility by 5. Since

---------------

 5 is a prime, we need at least one multiple of 5 in the sequence. The question is, how many consecutive

---------------

 odd numbers do we need to ensure that one of them is a multiple of 5? The spacing between multiples of 5 in the odd numbers is...

---------------

 Well, multiples of 5 are every 5 numbers, but since we're only considering odd numbers, the distance between two

---------------

 odd multiples of 5 would be 10. For example, 5, 15, 25, etc. So

---------------

 between any two odd multiples of 5, there are four other odd numbers. 

Therefore, to ensure that in any set

---------------

 of n consecutive odd numbers, there is at least one multiple of 5, n must be at least 5? Wait, let me think

---------------

 again. Let's see: if you have 5 consecutive odd numbers, like 1,3,5,7,9.

---------------

 Here 5 is a multiple of 5. Another example: 7,9,11,13,15.

---------------

 Here 15 is a multiple of 5. But if you take a sequence starting at 11: 11,13,15,17,19.

---------------

 Here 15 is included. Wait, actually, every 5 consecutive odd numbers must include a multiple of 5? Hmm

---------------

, let's check starting at 9: 9,11,13,15,17. Yes

---------------

, 15 is there. Starting at 13: 13,15,17,19,21. 15 is still there. Wait

---------------

, starting at 15: 15,17,19,21,23. Still has

---------------

 15. Hmm, but what if starting at 5: 5,7,9,11,13. Yes

---------------

, 5 is there. 

Wait, so actually, any 5 consecutive odd numbers must include a multiple of 5? Let

---------------

 me check a different starting point. Suppose starting at 1: 1,3,5,7,9. 

---------------

5 is there. Starting at 3: 3,5,7,9,11. 5 is there. Starting at 5: already

---------------

 has 5. Starting at 7: 7,9,11,13,15. 15 is there

---------------

. Starting at 9: 9,11,13,15,17. 15.

---------------

 Starting at 11: 11,13,15,17,19. 15. Starting

---------------

 at 13: 13,15,17,19,21. 15. Starting at 15: same.

---------------

 Starting at 17: 17,19,21,23,25. 25. So

---------------

 yeah, every 5 consecutive odd numbers must include a multiple of 5. Because between any two odd numbers spaced by 4

---------------

 steps (i.e., 5 numbers), you have a multiple of 5. Wait, actually, the distance between two

---------------

 odd multiples of 5 is 10, so every 5 odd numbers will span a span of 8 (since 

---------------

5 numbers with step 2 each: 2*4=8). Hmm, maybe my initial thought is right. 



---------------

So, for the 5 divisibility, n must be at least 5? But maybe even less? Let me check with

---------------

 n=4. Let's see if there exists 4 consecutive odd numbers without a multiple of 5. For example, 1,3,5,7:

---------------

 has 5. 3,5,7,9: has 5. 5,7,9,11: has

---------------

 5. 7,9,11,13: 10 is even, so 15 is

---------------

 not here. Wait, 7,9,11,13. The numbers here are 7,9,11,13. None of these are multiples of 5. So

---------------

 here's a sequence of 4 odd numbers with no multiple of 5. So that's a problem. So 4 is insufficient. Therefore

---------------

, to guarantee a multiple of 5, n must be at least 5. So 5 is required for the 5 part

---------------

.

Now moving on to the 3² part. We need at least two factors of 3 in the product. So,

---------------

 how do we ensure that any n consecutive odd integers will have at least two multiples of 3, or at least one multiple of 9? Hmm

---------------

, because two multiples of 3 would give two 3s, but a multiple of 9 would give two 3s as well. So either

---------------

 way, we need to have at least two 3s in the product. 

So, let's think of two scenarios: either there

---------------

 are two distinct multiples of 3 in the sequence, or one multiple of 9. Since 9 is 3², so

---------------

 if there's a multiple of 9, that contributes two 3s. 

First, let's see how often multiples of 3 occur in odd numbers. The odd multiples of 3 are every 6 numbers.

---------------

 Because every third number is a multiple of 3, but since we're only considering odds, the step between them is 6. For example: 3,9,15,21,... each is

---------------

 6 apart. So between two odd multiples of 3, there are two other odd numbers. 

Therefore, to have

---------------

 two multiples of 3 in a sequence of n odd numbers, the length must be such that within n numbers, you can't have

---------------

 a gap larger than the distance between two multiples of 3. Wait, perhaps another approach: to guarantee at least two multiples of 3 in any

---------------

 n consecutive odd numbers, how big does n have to be?

Alternatively, the maximum gap between two multiples of 3 in the odd numbers is 6,

---------------

 so to have two multiples, the sequence must span more than that. Wait, let's think in terms of the spacing. Since

---------------

 the odd multiples of 3 are spaced 6 apart, then between them, there are two odd numbers that are not multiples of 3. For example, between 3 and 9:

---------------

 5,7 are in between. Similarly, between 9 and 15: 11,13. So,

---------------

 if you have a run of 5 odd numbers, could you have only one multiple of 3?

Let me see.

---------------

 Let's try to construct a sequence of 5 odd numbers with only one multiple of 3. Let's see. Starting

---------------

 at 5: 5,7,9,11,13. Here, 9 is a multiple of 3. So

---------------

 that's one. So that's okay. But how about starting at 7: 7,9,11,13,15. Here, 9 and 15 are multiples of 3. So two.

---------------

 Hmm. Starting at 11: 11,13,15,17,19. 15 is a

---------------

 multiple of 3. Only one. Wait, so here's a sequence with only one multiple of 3. So 

---------------

15 is there. So in 5 consecutive odds starting at 11, we have 15 as the only multiple of 3. Similarly

---------------

, starting at 13: 13,15,17,19,21. 15 and 21 are

---------------

 multiples of 3. So two. Hmm, so depending on where you start, 5 numbers can have one or two multiples. 



---------------

Therefore, 5 numbers might not be enough. Let's see, what's the maximum number of non-multiples of 3 between

---------------

 two odd multiples of 3? Between 3 and 9, there are 5,7. Between 9 and 15: 11,13. So two

---------------

 numbers. So the maximum number of odd numbers between two multiples of 3 is two. Therefore, if you have a run of three

---------------

 non-multiples of 3, that's not possible. So between two multiples of 3, there can only be two non-multiples. Therefore

---------------

, in a sequence of 5 odd numbers, you can have at most two non-multiples of 3 between two multiples,

---------------

 so the total would be 3 multiples? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the maximum number of consecutive

---------------

 odd numbers without a multiple of 3 is 2. For example, between 3 and 9, there are 5 and 7, which are two numbers. So

---------------

, if you have three consecutive odd numbers, you must contain a multiple of 3? Let's see: 5,7,9.

---------------

 Here, 9 is a multiple. 7,9,11: 9 is a multiple. 9,11,13: 9 is there

---------------

. 11,13,15: 15 is there. So yes, any three consecutive odds will have

---------------

 at least one multiple of 3. Wait, so that's important. So for three consecutive odds, you must have at least one multiple of 3. 



---------------

Therefore, in any n consecutive odds, the number of multiples of 3 is at least floor(n/3) or something? Hmm

---------------

, not exactly. Let me see: since every three consecutive odds must include a multiple of 3, then in n consecutive

---------------

 odds, the number of multiples of 3 is at least ceiling(n/3). Wait, maybe not exactly, but perhaps

---------------

 the minimum number of multiples of 3 in n consecutive odds is floor((n + something)/something). Let's think differently

---------------

.

Suppose we want at least two multiples of 3 in the sequence. The worst case would be when the sequence starts

---------------

 just after a multiple of 3. Let's see. Suppose starting at 5: 5,7,9,11,13. Here

---------------

, 9 is the first multiple of 3. Then 15 would be the next. So between 5 and 15, the

---------------

 multiples of 3 are 9 and 15. So in a span of 5,7,9,11,13, there

---------------

's only one multiple of 3 (9). Then to get another multiple of 3, you have to go to 15. So if

---------------

 I have a sequence starting at 5, with n=5, only one multiple of 3. To get two multiples, the

---------------

 sequence would need to include 9 and 15. So starting at 5, to reach 15, that

---------------

's 5 numbers: 5,7,9,11,13,15 would be 6 numbers. Wait, 

---------------

5 to 15 is 6 numbers (since each step is +2). So starting at 5, the first

---------------

 multiple is at 9 (position 3), next at 15 (position 6). Therefore, to have two multiples of 3, you

---------------

 need at least 6 numbers? Let me check. 

Take 5 numbers: 5,7,9,11,13:

---------------

 only one multiple of 3 (9). 6 numbers: 5,7,9,11,13,15: two multiples (9 and15). So

---------------

 6 numbers would guarantee two multiples of 3? Let's see another example. Starting at 7: 7,9,11,13,15,17: multiples

---------------

 at 9 and15. Two. Starting at 11: 11,13,15,17,19,21: 15 and21. Two

---------------

. Starting at 1: 1,3,5,7,9,11: multiples at 3 and9. Two. So

---------------

 yes, in 6 numbers, you have two multiples of 3. However, let me check a shorter sequence. What

---------------

 if n=5? As above, sometimes only one. So n=6 would guarantee two. 

Wait, but let

---------------

's see if there's a way to have a 6-length sequence with only one multiple of 3? Let's see. Starting

---------------

 at 8? Wait, but we can't start at even numbers. Let's try starting at 14 (but 14 is even,

---------------

 so next odd is 15). Hmm, starting at 15: 15,17,19,21,23,25. Multiples at

---------------

 15 and21. Two again. Starting at 17:17,19,21,23,25,27: 21 and27. Two

---------------

. So no, seems like any 6 consecutive odds must include two multiples of 3. Because the spacing between multiples is 6, so in

---------------

 6 numbers, you can have at most two non-multiples between them? Wait, actually, the distance between multiples

---------------

 of 3 in odds is 6. So every 6 numbers, you get a multiple. So over 6 numbers, you must

---------------

 have at least two? Wait, let me think of the first multiple, then 6 numbers later. Wait, perhaps a

---------------

 better way is to note that in any block of 6 consecutive odd numbers, since every third odd number is a multiple of 3, so

---------------

 6 odds would contain two multiples of 3. Since 6 divided by 3 is 2. Exactly. Because

---------------

 every third odd number is a multiple of 3, so in 3 numbers, 1 multiple, so in 6 numbers, 2 multiples. So

---------------

 yeah, so 6 numbers would have two multiples of 3. Therefore, the minimal n needed for the 3² part

---------------

 would be 6? Because with two multiples of 3, you have at least two 3s. Unless one of them is a multiple of 9, which would

---------------

 give an extra 3. 

Wait, but even if one of them is a multiple of 9, that's still okay. The

---------------

 key is that the product must have at least two 3s. So if you have two multiples of 3, even

---------------

 if one is 3 itself, then 3*3 would give two 3s. Alternatively, if one is a multiple of 9 (like

---------------

 9, 15 is not a multiple of 9, but 9 is), then that's two 3s from

---------------

 that single number. So either way, two multiples of 3 give at least two 3s, so 6 is

---------------

 sufficient. But is 5 sufficient? Let's see. For example, take the sequence 5,7,9,11,13. Here

---------------

, only one multiple of 3 (9), so only one 3. So that product would have only one 3, which is insufficient for 3². So

---------------

 5 is not enough. So n=6 is needed for the 3² part.

Therefore, combining both requirements: the

---------------

 product must have at least one 5 and two 3s. 

So for the 5, we needed n at least 5, and for the 3², n at least 6. So

---------------

 the total n must satisfy both, so the maximum of 5 and 6, which is 6. But wait, but

---------------

 maybe there's an overlap? For example, maybe when n=6, we can satisfy both conditions. Let me check.



---------------

Wait, but actually, the problem says "the product of any n odd consecutive positive integers is divisible by 45". So n

---------------

 must be such that both conditions are satisfied for any sequence. So n must be at least 6 to ensure two 3s, and at least 5 to ensure one 5. Since

---------------

 6 is larger, that would be the minimal n? But maybe 6 is not sufficient? Let me test with n=6.

Take the

---------------

 sequence starting at 1: 1,3,5,7,9,11. The product includes 3,5,9. The

---------------

 factors of 3: 3 and 9 (which is 3²), so total 3^3. The

---------------

 factor of 5 is 5. So 3²×5 is present. So divisible by 45. 

Another example: starting at 5: 5,7,9,11,13,15. Here

---------------

, multiples of 3 are 9 and 15 (but 15 is 3×5). So total

---------------

 factors of 3: two (from 9: 3² and 15: 3^1). So total

---------------

 3^3? Wait, 9 has two, 15 has one. So total three 3s, which

---------------

 is more than enough. Also, the 5 is in 5 and 15. So 5 is present. So divisible

---------------

 by 45.

Another test case: starting at 7:7,9,11,13,15,17. Here

---------------

, multiples of 3:9 and15. So two 3s (from 9 and15). The

---------------

 5 is in 15. So 3²×5 is there. Good.

What about starting at 11:11,13,15,17,19,21. Multip

---------------

les of 3:15 and21. 15 gives 3 and5, 21 gives 3. So total 

---------------

3^2×5. So yes, divisible by 45.

Starting at 15:15,17,19,21,23,25. 15 gives

---------------

 3 and5, 21 gives 3. Also, 25 is 5². So 3²×5². Good

---------------

.

Starting at 17:17,19,21,23,25,27. 21 gives

---------------

 3, 27 gives 3³, 25 gives 5. So 3^4×5. Okay

---------------

.

Hmm, seems okay. What about a sequence that might have only one multiple of 5? Let's see. Let

---------------

's try starting at 1: the first 6 numbers include 5. Starting at 3: 3,5,7,9,11,13.

---------------

 5 is there. Starting at 5: as before. Starting at 7: includes 15? Wait, 7,9,11,13,15,17.

---------------

 15 is the 5. Starting at 9:9,11,13,15,17,19. 15 again. Starting at 11:1

---------------

1,13,15,17,19,21. 15. Starting at 13:13,15,17,19,21,23. 15. Starting at 15:15,...

---------------

 so 15 is there. Starting at 17:17,... has 25? Wait, 17 to

---------------

 27: the 5 is in 25? Wait, 17,19,21,23,25,27. 

---------------

25 is there. So yes, every 6 consecutive odds will include a multiple of 5. Because 6 odds

---------------

 span 10 numbers (since 6*2=12? Wait, actually, 6 odd numbers starting at x

---------------

 would be x, x+2, x+4, x+6, x+8, x+10. So the span

---------------

 is 10. So over 10 numbers, there must be at least two multiples of 5, but even

---------------

 one is sufficient here. Wait, but 10 numbers would include at least one multiple of 5? Wait, 

---------------

10 numbers in a row (consecutive integers) will include exactly two multiples of 5, but since we are only

---------------

 taking the odd ones, maybe only one?

Wait, actually, in 6 consecutive odd numbers, the numbers are spaced by 2, so over

---------------

 a span of 10 numbers (from x to x+10). In those 10 numbers, there are

---------------

 two multiples of 5 (since 10 is a multiple of 5). But since we are only taking the odd numbers, how

---------------

 many of those multiples of 5 are odd?

Suppose the starting number is odd. Let me think of an example.

---------------

 Let's say starting at 1: numbers 1,3,5,7,9,11. The multiples of 5 here are 5. So

---------------

 one. Starting at 3:3,5,7,9,11,13. 5 again. Starting at 5:5,7,9,11,13,15. 5 and15.

---------------

 So two multiples of 5. Starting at 7:7,9,11,13,15,17. 15. Starting at 9:9,11,13,15,17,19. 15. Starting at 11:11,13,15,17,19,21. 15. Starting at 13:13,15,17,19,21,23. 15. Starting at 15:15,17,19,21,23,25. 15 and25. So

---------------

 two. Starting at 17:17,19,21,23,25,27. 25. Starting

---------------

 at 19:19,21,23,25,27,29. 25. Starting

---------------

 at 21:21,23,25,27,29,31. 25. Starting

---------------

 at 23:23,25,27,29,31,33. 25 and35? Wait, 25 and 

---------------

35 would be in the next set. Hmm, 23 to 33: 25 and 35?

---------------

 Wait 23,25,27,29,31,33. The multiples of 5 are 25. 

---------------

35 is outside. So only one. Wait, 23 to 33: the numbers are 23,25,27,29,31,33. 

---------------

25 is there. 35 would be the next, but that's beyond. So only one. 

Wait a second, so

---------------

 starting at 23, the six numbers are 23,25,27,29,31,33. Here

---------------

, 25 is a multiple of 5, so that's one. So okay, still at least one. So

---------------

 in any 6 consecutive odds, you have at least one multiple of 5. Because in 6 numbers, the span is 10 (

---------------

since 6 steps of 2). Since 10 is a multiple of 5, the span includes at least one multiple of 5. Wait

---------------

, actually, even more precise: in any 10 consecutive numbers (since the span is 10), there are

---------------

 exactly two multiples of 5. But when taking only the odd numbers within that span, you can have either one or two multiples

---------------

 of 5, depending on where you start. Wait, but in the case starting at 23, the span is 23 to 33.

---------------

 The multiples of 5 in that span are 25 and 30. But 30 is even, so only 25 is included in the odd numbers. So one

---------------

. Similarly, starting at 25:25,27,29,31,33,35. 

---------------

25 and 35. So two. 

So in some cases, you can have two, but the minimum is one. Therefore

---------------

, 6 consecutive odds will always include at least one multiple of 5. So that's good. So with n=6, the

---------------

 product will have at least one 5 and at least two 3s, so divisible by 45. 

But wait

---------------

, let's check the case when n=5. For example, the sequence 1,3,5,7,9. The

---------------

 product includes 3,5,9 (which is 3²). So that's 3²×5, so divisible by 45. Hmm

---------------

, so that works. Wait, but earlier I thought that n=5 might not be enough because of the 3's

---------------

 part? Wait, but here in n=5, the product can have two 3s (if there is a multiple of 9). Wait

---------------

, but in some sequences of 5 odds, maybe there is only one 3?

Wait, let's see. Let

---------------

's take the sequence 5,7,9,11,13. Here, the multiples of 3 are only 9. So that

---------------

's 3². So the 3 exponent is 2. So that's okay. The 5 is there.

---------------

 So 5×3² is present. So divisible by 45. Wait, so maybe even n=5 is

---------------

 sufficient?

Wait, but hold on. Let me think of a sequence of 5 odd numbers that has only one 3 and

---------------

 one 5. Wait, is that possible?

Wait, take 7,9,11,13,15. Here, multiples of 3 are 9 and 15 (since

---------------

 15 is 3×5). So 9 gives two 3s, 15 gives one 3 and one 5. So total 3³×5. That

---------------

's okay. Another example: 11,13,15,17,19. 15 is 

---------------

3×5, so one 3 and one 5. But also 15 is the only multiple of 3. Wait, so

---------------

 total 3^1? Wait no, 15 is 3×5, so that's one 3. But

---------------

 the other numbers: 11,13,17,19 are not multiples of 3. So total

---------------

 exponent of 3 is 1, which is insufficient. Wait, so here's a problem. 

Wait, the sequence 11,13,15,17,19. The

---------------

 product is 11×13×15×17×19. Let's see factors of 3: only in 15.

---------------

 So 15 is 3×5. So the exponent of 3 is 1. So 3^1×

---------------

5^1. But 45 requires 3²×5^1. So that's not enough. Therefore, n

---------------

=5 is insufficient because in this case, there's only one 3. 

Ah! So that's a key point. So even

---------------

 though some 5-number sequences have two 3s (like the first example with 1,3,5,7,9),

---------------

 there exists a sequence (like 11,13,15,17,19) where there is only one 3.

---------------

 Hence, n=5 is not sufficient. 

So n=5 is insufficient. Therefore, n must be 6. Let

---------------

's confirm with n=6. Let's take the problematic sequence extended to 6 numbers. The previous example with 11 to

---------------

 19 is 5 numbers. Let's take 6 numbers starting at 11: 11,13,15,17,19,21. Now, the multiples of 3 are 15 and21. 15 is

---------------

 3×5, and 21 is 3×7. So total 3^2×5×... So that

---------------

 gives us two 3s and one 5. So divisible by 45. 

Another test case: starting at 2

---------------

3, six numbers:23,25,27,29,31,33. The multiples of 3 are 27 (3^3) and 33 (3×11). So two

---------------

 multiples of 3, giving 3^4, and 25 (5²). So that's good. 

Wait

---------------

, so even the sequence starting at 11, which failed for n=5, when extended to 6, works

---------------

. So n=6 is sufficient. 

But let's check another edge case. Suppose starting at 15: 15,17,19,21,23,25. Here

---------------

, multiples of 3 are 15 (3×5) and21 (3×7). So two 3s and

---------------

 one 5 (from 15 and25). 

Another edge case: starting at 5:5,7,9,11,13,15. Multip

---------------

les of 3:9 (3²) and15 (3×5). So two 3s. 

Wait

---------------

, so all the 6-length sequences seem to have at least two 3s and at least one 5. Therefore

---------------

, n=6 is sufficient. 

Is there a smaller n? Let's check n=6 is minimal. Since n=5 can

---------------

 fail (as shown), so 6 is indeed the minimal. 

Wait, but let me think if there is a case

---------------

 where n=6 might not have two 3s? Suppose starting at 3: 3,5,7,9,11,13. Multip

---------------

les of 3:3 (3^1) and9 (3²). So total exponent of 3 is 3. Okay

---------------

. 

Starting at 7:7,9,11,13,15,17. 9 and15.

---------------

 9 gives 2, 15 gives 1. Total 3. 

Starting at 9:9,11,13,15,17,19. 9 and15: same

---------------

 as above. 

Starting at 1:1,3,5,7,9,11. 3 and9: 

---------------

1+2=3. 

Starting at 25:25,27,29,31,33,35. 27 (3^3), 33 (3×11). So two multiples.

---------------

 

So all sequences of 6 have at least two multiples of 3. Therefore, two 3s at minimum, so

---------------

 the product will have 3²×5. So 45 divides it. 

Therefore, the minimal n is 6. Wait, but let

---------------

 me check n=6 with another example where maybe the 5 is not present? Wait, can a 6-term sequence of odd numbers not

---------------

 include any multiple of 5? 

Wait, let's see. Let's try to find 6 consecutive odd numbers with no multiple of 5. Let

---------------

's see. Let's start at 7:7,9,11,13,15,17. 

---------------

15 is a multiple of 5. Not good. Starting at 1: includes 5. Starting at 3: includes 5. Starting at 11:11,13,15,17,19,21. 15. Starting at 17:17,19,21,23,25,27. 25. Starting at 19:19,21,23,25,27,29. 25. Starting at 21:21,23,25,27,29,31. 25. Starting at 23:23,25,27,29,31,33. 25. Starting at 27:27,29,31,33,35,37. 35 is a multiple of 5. So

---------------

 35 is included. 

Hmm, so it's impossible to have 6 consecutive odd numbers without a multiple of 5. Because every

---------------

 5 consecutive odds must include a multiple of 5, as earlier reasoning. Wait, actually, the span of 6 odd numbers is

---------------

 10 numbers apart. Since 5 divides into 10, so within any 10 consecutive numbers, there must

---------------

 be at least two multiples of 5, but since we are only taking the odd ones, at least one must be present

---------------

. 

Therefore, 6 consecutive odds must contain at least one multiple of 5. So yes, so n=6 is

---------------

 sufficient for both conditions. 

Therefore, the minimal n is 6. 

Wait, but let me check the problem statement again. It says "the product of any n odd consecutive positive integers is divisible by 45". So n

---------------

=6 works, and n=5 doesn't (as shown in the 11-19 example). Therefore, the answer should be 6. 

Wait

---------------

, but hold on. Let me think again. The problem says "the least positive integer n". So 6 is the minimal.

---------------

 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the 3 exponents. Let me verify the case of n=6 with

---------------

 the sequence starting at 11:11,13,15,17,19,21. The multiples

---------------

 of 3 here are 15 (3×5) and21 (3×7). So the total number

---------------

 of 3s is 2. So 3²×5 is present, so divisible by 45. 



---------------

Another test: starting at 23:23,25,27,29,31,33. 

---------------

27 is 3³, 33 is 3×11. So 3^4×5 (

---------------

from 25). 

Starting at 7:7,9,11,13,15,17. 9 is

---------------

 3², 15 is 3×5. So 3³×5. 

So all of them have

---------------

 at least two 3s and one 5. 

Therefore, 6 is the minimal n. 

Therefore, the answer should be 6. Wait, but let

---------------

 me check once more if there's a case where even with n=6, the product might not be divisible by 45. 



---------------

Suppose starting at 1:1×3×5×7×9×11. The product includes 3,5,9 (which is 3²). So 3³

---------------

×5×... So yes, divisible by 45. 

Another edge case: starting at 49 (just

---------------

 to check higher numbers). 49,51,53,55,57,59. Here

---------------

, multiples of 3:51 (3×17),57 (3×19). So two 3s. 

---------------

55 is 5×11. So 5 is present. So divisible by 45. 

Thus, I

---------------

 think 6 is correct. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me see if there is a smaller n where maybe the

---------------

 overlapping of conditions could work. For instance, n=5. Suppose there is a case where even with n=5, it

---------------

's okay? But as we saw, the sequence 11,13,15,17,19 gives

---------------

 a product with only one 3. So that's not enough. 

Alternatively, perhaps n=5 could be sufficient if the

---------------

 multiple of 5 is also a multiple of 9? For example, if the 5 multiple is 15 (which is 3×5), but

---------------

 that only gives one 3. So even if the multiple of 5 is a multiple of 3, you still need another multiple of 3 to

---------------

 get two 3s. 

So in the example starting at 11, the 15 gives one 3, but there

---------------

's another multiple of 3 at 21 only when you have n=6. So n=5 can't reach

---------------

 that. 

Therefore, the minimal n is indeed 6. 

Therefore, the answer is 6. 

**Final Answer**
\boxed{6}


To determine the least positive integer \( n \) such that the product of any \( n \) consecutive odd positive integers is divisible by 45, we need to ensure the product has at least \( 3^2 \) and \( 5 \) in its prime factors.

1. **Divisibility by 5**:
   - The

---------------

 multiples of 5 in odd numbers are spaced 10 apart (e.g., 5, 15, 25, ...).
   - To guarantee at least one multiple of 5 in any sequence of \( n \) consecutive odd numbers, \( n \) must be at least 5. However, checking

---------------

 smaller values, we find that 5 consecutive odd numbers can sometimes exclude a multiple of 5 (e.g., 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 includes 15, but starting at 11:

---------------

 11, 13, 15, 17, 19 includes 15). However, further

---------------

 analysis shows that any 5 consecutive odd numbers will include a multiple of 5. However, to ensure this, we need to check

---------------

 higher \( n \).

2. **Divisibility by \( 3^2 \)**:
   - The multiples of 3 in odd numbers are spaced 6 apart (e.g., 3, 9, 15, ...).
   - To guarantee at least two multiples of 3 (or one multiple of 9) in any sequence, we need \( n \) to be at

---------------

 least 6. For example, 6 consecutive odd numbers will always include two multiples of 3 (e.g., 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 includes 9 and 15).

3. **Combining Both

---------------

 Conditions**:
   - For \( n = 5 \), there exists a sequence (e.g., 11, 13, 15, 17, 19) that

---------------

 only has one multiple of 3 (15), which is insufficient for \( 3^2 \).
   - For \( n = 6 \), every sequence of 6 consecutive odd numbers will include at least one multiple of 5 and two multiples of 3. Examples:


---------------

     - Starting at 11: 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21 includes 15 (3×5) and 21 (3×7), providing \( 3^2 \times 5 \).
     - Starting at 23: 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33 includes 25 (5×5) and 27 (3³), providing \( 3^2 \times 5 \).

Thus, the minimal \( n \) ensuring the product is divisible by 45 for any sequence of \( n \) consecutive odd positive integers is \( \boxed{6} \).<|im_end|>
