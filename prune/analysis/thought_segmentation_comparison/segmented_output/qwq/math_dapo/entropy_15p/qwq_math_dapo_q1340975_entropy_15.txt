Okay, let's see. The problem says a softball team played ten games, scoring runs from 1 up to 10 in each game. So their

---------------

 scores are exactly 1,2,3,...,10. Now, they lost by one run in exactly five of these games. In the other five games, they scored twice as many runs as their opponents. The question is asking for the total runs scored by their opponents across

---------------

 all ten games.

Hmm, so first, maybe I need to figure out for each game whether it was a loss by one run or a win where they scored twice as much. Since they lost five games by one run, that means in those five games, the opponent's score was one more than theirs. In

---------------

 the other five games, they won by having twice the opponent's runs. 

Wait, actually, when they lost by one run, that

---------------

 means the opponent scored one more run than them. So in those five games, opponent's runs = their runs + 1. In

---------------

 the other five games, they won, so their runs were twice the opponent's. So opponent's runs in those games would be their runs divided by 2. But since runs have to be whole numbers, that

---------------

 might be important.

So, the total runs by opponents would be the sum over all ten games of (opponent's runs in each game). So

---------------

 for each game, if the game was a loss by 1, then opponent's runs = their runs +1. If it was a win by

---------------

 twice as many, opponent's runs = their runs / 2. But we need to assign which of the 1-10 runs games

---------------

 correspond to which category (loss by 1 or win by twice).

The challenge here is to figure out which of the ten

---------------

 games (with scores 1-10) are the five losses and which are the five wins. The key is that in the winning

---------------

 games, their runs must be even numbers because they have to be twice the opponent's runs. Because if they scored twice as many, then opponent's runs must be half

---------------

 of theirs, so their runs must be even. So, in the winning games, their runs have to be even numbers,

---------------

 so that when divided by 2, you get an integer.

Therefore, the five games where they won (and scored twice as much) must correspond to even-number

---------------

ed runs they scored. Wait, but the runs they scored are 1 through 10. The even numbers among those are 2,4,6,8,10. That's five numbers. Perfect

---------------

! So maybe those five games (2,4,6,8,10 runs) are their wins, where they scored twice as much as the opponent. Then the other five games (1,3,5,7,9 runs) are the losses by one run, so opponents

---------------

 scored one more than them in those games.

Wait, but let me check that. If the even runs are the wins, then opponent

---------------

's runs in those games would be their runs divided by 2. So for example, when they scored 2, opponent scored

---------------

 1; 4 would be 2, 6 would be 3, 8 would be 4, and 10 would be 5. Then

---------------

 in the odd runs (1,3,5,7,9), they lost by one, so opponents scored 2,4,6,8,10 respectively. 



---------------

So total opponent runs would be:

For the wins (their even runs):

Opponent runs: (2/2)+(4/2)+(6/2)+(8/2)+(10/2) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.

For the losses (their odd runs):

Opponent runs: (1+1)+(3+1)+(5+1)+(7+1)+(9+1) = 2 +4 +6 +8 +10 = 30.

So

---------------

 total opponent runs would be 15 + 30 = 45. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me check

---------------

 again.

Wait, but hold on. The problem says they lost by one run in exactly five games. So in those five games, they

---------------

 lost, meaning the opponent had more runs. So in those games, their runs are 1,3,5,7,9, and opponents had

---------------

 2,4,6,8,10. So opponents in those five games: 2+4+6+8+10=30. 



---------------

In the other five games, which are their wins, they scored twice as many as the opponent. Since they scored even numbers (

---------------

2,4,6,8,10), opponents in those games would have 1,2,3,4,5. So adding

---------------

 those: 1+2+3+4+5=15. 

Total opponents runs: 30+15=45. So

---------------

 the answer would be 45? 

Wait, but let me make sure there isn't another way to assign the games. For

---------------

 example, maybe some of the even numbers could be in the losses? But if they lost by one run, their score is one less than the opponent. So

---------------

 if they scored an even number in a loss, the opponent would have an odd number (even +1). But the opponent's runs don

---------------

't have to be even or odd, but the problem states that the team's scores are exactly 1-10. The

---------------

 opponents' runs aren't constrained except by the conditions given.

Wait, but the key point is that in the winning games, the team's runs must be even so

---------------

 that the opponent's runs can be half of that. So if in any of the winning games, the team's runs were odd, then the

---------------

 opponent's runs would have to be a non-integer, which isn't possible. Therefore, the winning games must be exactly the even numbered

---------------

 scores. So that's the only possible way. Therefore, the total runs by opponents would indeed be 45.

Hmm

---------------

, but let me think again. Let me try to see if there's an alternative assignment. Suppose instead, for example, that one of the even

---------------

 scores is a loss. Let's say, for instance, the game where they scored 2 runs was a loss. Then the opponent would have scored 3 runs. Then,

---------------

 the opponent's runs in that game would be 3, and the team's score is 2. But then, the

---------------

 team's other wins would have to be the remaining even numbers (4,6,8,10) but that's

---------------

 only four games, so they need one more game where they won by twice as many. But the remaining scores are the odd numbers except

---------------

 for 1,3,5,7,9. Wait, but if they assigned one even game as a loss, then the

---------------

 remaining even games would be four, so they need five wins but only four even scores left. So that's not possible. So

---------------

 that's why the only way is to have all even scores as wins and odd as losses. Therefore, the total is 45. 

Therefore

---------------

, the answer should be 45. Wait, but let me check once again with the actual numbers. 

Calculating opponents'

---------------

 runs for each game:

When the team scored 1 (a loss): opponent has 2. 

Team 2 (a win): opponent has 1.

Team 3 (loss): opponent 4.

Team4 (win): 2.

Team5 (loss): 6.

Team6 (win):3.

Team7 (loss):8.

Team8 (win):4.

Team9 (loss):10.

Team10 (win):5.

Adding all

---------------

 opponents' runs:

2 +1 +4 +2 +6 +3 +8 +4 +10 +5. Let's add these step by step:

Start with 2 (from first

---------------

 game)

+1 =3

+4 =7

+2 =9

+6 =15

+3 =18

+8 =26

+4 =30

+10 =40

+5 =45.

Yep, that adds up to 45. So that

---------------

's correct. So I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
Answer: 45


The softball team played ten games, scoring runs from 1 to 10. They lost by one run in five games and won the other five games by scoring twice as many runs as their opponents. 

To determine the opponents' total runs:
1. **Losses by one run**: The team's scores in these games must be odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9). The opponents' scores are therefore one more than these scores:
   - Opponents' runs: \( (1+1) + (3+1) + (5+1) + (7+1) + (9+1) = 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30 \).

2. **Wins by twice as many runs**: The team's scores in these games must be even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, 10). The opponents' scores are half of these scores:
   - Opponents' runs: \( \frac{2}{2} + \frac{4}{2} + \frac{6}{2} + \frac{8}{2} + \frac{10}{2} = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 \).

Summing the opponents' runs from both scenarios:
- Total opponents' runs: \( 30 + 15 = 45 \).
