Okay, so I need to find the maximum possible value of the sum of the squares of the distances between all pairs of 12 points in the plane, where each pair of points is at most 1 unit apart. Hmm, let

---------------

's see. The problem is asking for the maximum of the sum of |P_iP_j|² over all i < j, given that no

---------------

 two points are more than 1 unit apart. 

First, I should recall that the square of the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is (x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)². So the sum we want

---------------

 to maximize is the sum over all pairs of these squared distances. Since all distances are at most 1, each term in the sum is at most 1² = 1. But since

---------------

 we want to maximize the total sum, maybe we need to arrange the points so that as many pairs as possible have the maximum distance of 1.

---------------

 

But how do you arrange 12 points so that as many pairs as possible are exactly 1 unit apart? Maybe

---------------

 arranging them in some regular polygon? But wait, in a regular polygon with n vertices, each vertex is distance 1 from its neighbors, but the distance between non-adjacent vertices can

---------------

 be larger than 1. Since the problem states that all distances must be at most 1, so that won't work because

---------------

 in a regular polygon with more sides, the diameter (distance between opposite vertices) can be greater than 1. For example, in a regular hexagon, the distance between opposite vertices is 2, which is more

---------------

 than 1. So that's not allowed here. 

Hmm, so perhaps arranging all the points in a configuration where every

---------------

 pair is exactly 1 unit apart? But that's impossible unless all points are the same point, but then all distances are zero. Wait

---------------

, no, that's not the case. Wait, actually, if all points coincide, then all distances are zero, so the sum would be zero, which is the

---------------

 minimum. So that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe arrange points such that as many pairs as possible are exactly 1 unit apart, but keeping

---------------

 all other distances within 1. Maybe arranging them in some configuration where points form a regular simplex? But in the plane, a simplex can

---------------

 only have three points (equilateral triangle) with all distances equal. For more points, you can't have all pairs at

---------------

 the same distance. 

Alternatively, perhaps arrange the points in two separate clusters, each cluster forming an equilateral triangle with side length 1, and the

---------------

 clusters separated by some distance. Wait, but then points from different clusters would have distances between them that might exceed 1.

---------------

 

Alternatively, maybe arrange all points on a circle of radius r such that the maximum distance between any two points is 1. The maximum distance on a circle is the diameter, so if

---------------

 the diameter is 1, then the radius is 0.5. But then, all points lie on a circle of radius 0.5. The

---------------

 distance between two points on such a circle would be at most 1 (the diameter). Then, the squared distance between two points separated

---------------

 by angle θ would be 2r²(1 - cosθ). Since r = 0.5, this

---------------

 becomes 2*(0.25)*(1 - cosθ) = 0.5*(1 - cosθ). To

---------------

 maximize the sum of all squared distances, we need to arrange as many points as possible such that their angular separation is as large as possible (

---------------

to maximize 1 - cosθ). 

But if all points are on a circle of radius 0.5, the maximum distance

---------------

 between any two is 1 (the diameter). But if we have 12 points on such a circle, how do

---------------

 we maximize the sum of squared distances? 

Alternatively, maybe arrange the points in such a way that as many pairs as possible are exactly 1 unit apart, but

---------------

 without violating the maximum distance constraint. Since each point can be part of multiple edges of length 1, but all other distances must be

---------------

 ≤1. 

Alternatively, think of the problem as an optimization problem. Let me consider coordinates. Suppose we can place points

---------------

 in the plane such that many pairs are at distance 1, and others are as far as possible (but still ≤1). 



---------------

Wait, maybe the optimal configuration is when all points are arranged in two diametrically opposed clusters. For instance, split the 12 points into two groups of 6 points each, placed

---------------

 at two opposite points, separated by 1 unit. Then, the distance between any two points within the same cluster is 0 (since they are all at the same point), and the distance between any two points from different clusters is exactly 1. 



---------------

Wait, this might work. Let me see. If we have two points, say point A and point B, separated by 1 unit. Then, if

---------------

 we have 6 points at A and 6 points at B, then each pair of points within the same cluster (all

---------------

 at A or all at B) have distance 0, and each pair between the clusters have distance 1. Then the total sum would be the number of cross pairs multiplied by 1². The number of cross pairs is 6*6=36. The

---------------

 total sum would be 36*1 = 36. 

Is that the maximum? Let's see if we

---------------

 can do better. 

Alternatively, maybe having three clusters? Suppose three points each separated by 1 unit from each other, forming an equilateral triangle.

---------------

 Then place 4 points at each vertex. Then, the distance between points in the same cluster is 0, between different

---------------

 clusters: between two vertices, the distance is 1. So the number of cross pairs would be 4*4 (

---------------

between first and second) + 4*4 (between first and third) + 4*4 (between second and third) = 3*(16) = 48. Each of these pairs

---------------

 contributes 1², so total sum is 48. Wait, that's better. But can we do this?

Wait, but

---------------

 in an equilateral triangle with three vertices, each pair of vertices is exactly 1 unit apart. So if we have three

---------------

 clusters each at the vertices of an equilateral triangle with side length 1, then placing 4 points at each vertex,

---------------

 then indeed, the distance between any two points in different clusters is exactly 1. The total cross pairs would be (4*4)*3 = 48, so

---------------

 the sum would be 48. But the problem allows up to 12 points, so 4+4+4=12.

---------------

 That works. 

Wait, so that gives a higher total than the two-cluster case. So maybe three clusters are better. 



---------------

Continuing this idea, if we can have more clusters, each pair of clusters separated by 1 unit, then the total

---------------

 number of cross pairs would be higher. But how many clusters can we have such that every pair of clusters is exactly 1 unit apart?

Wait

---------------

, in the plane, how many points can you have such that every pair is exactly 1 unit apart? That's the

---------------

 problem of equidistant points. In the plane, the maximum number is 3 (equilateral triangle). So if you want multiple

---------------

 clusters (points) each separated by 1 unit, you can only have 3 clusters. So three clusters forming an equilateral triangle with

---------------

 side 1, each cluster having 4 points. Then the total sum is 3*(4*4)=48. 

Alternatively, what

---------------

 if we have four clusters? To have four points in the plane with each pair at distance 1, that's impossible,

---------------

 since you can't have four equidistant points in the plane. The regular tetrahedron is in 3D. So in 2D, the

---------------

 maximum is three. Therefore, with three clusters, each separated by 1, that's the maximum. 

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 arrange the points in a different configuration where some distances are 1, but not all between clusters. Maybe overlapping clusters? Or

---------------

 arranging points in some other symmetric figure?

Wait, another thought. If I arrange all 12 points on the circumference of a regular hexagon with side length 1. Then

---------------

, the distance between adjacent vertices is 1, but the distance between vertices two apart is √3, which is about

---------------

 1.732, which exceeds 1. So that's not allowed. So that won't work. 

Alternatively, a

---------------

 regular hexagon with radius 0.5. Then, the side length would be equal to the radius? Wait, no

---------------

. Let's recall that in a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the side length is equal to r. So if we have a regular hexagon with side length 1, the radius is 1. Then

---------------

 the distance between opposite vertices is 2, which is over 1. So that's bad. To have all points within distance

---------------

 1, the maximum distance between any two points must be ≤1. So the diameter of the set must be ≤1. So

---------------

 the entire set must fit within a circle of diameter 1, or within some other shape where the maximum distance between any two points is 1. 

Wait

---------------

, so if all points are in a circle of diameter 1, then the maximum distance between any two is 1, so

---------------

 that satisfies the condition. To maximize the sum of squared distances, perhaps arranging the points as far apart as possible within that circle. 



---------------

The problem then reduces to arranging 12 points in a circle of diameter 1 (radius 0.5) to maximize the sum of squared distances between all pairs. 

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps the optimal arrangement is when the points are equally spaced on the circumference of such a circle. Let me compute the squared distance between two points on a circle of radius r separated

---------------

 by angle θ. The distance squared is 2r²(1 - cosθ). Since the radius here is 0.5, so

---------------

 r = 0.5, so the squared distance becomes 2*(0.25)*(1 - cosθ) = 0.5*(1 - cosθ). 

If

---------------

 the points are equally spaced, then the angle between adjacent points is 2π/12 = π/6. The

---------------

 angle between two points separated by k steps is kπ/6. 

The total sum would be the sum over all pairs of 0.5*(1 - cosθ_ij

---------------

), where θ_ij is the angle between points i and j. 

Hmm, but calculating that might be complicated. Alternatively

---------------

, maybe arranging points in two opposite clusters as before, but with more clusters? Wait, but as before, three clusters give

---------------

 a higher total. Let me see. 

Wait, let's compare the two cases. 

Case 1: Two clusters,

---------------

 6 points each, separated by 1 unit. The total sum is 6*6*1² = 36. 

Case 2: Three clusters, 4 points each, forming an equilateral triangle with side 1. The total sum is 3*(4*4)*1² = 48. 

Case

---------------

 3: Maybe four clusters? But as I thought before, in 2D, you can't have four points all pairwise

---------------

 1 unit apart. But maybe three clusters with some other points? Not sure. 

Alternatively, if we have three clusters (

---------------

equilateral triangle) with 4 points each, that gives 48. What if we have more clusters but with distances

---------------

 less than 1? For example, if we have four clusters arranged in a square of side length 1. Wait, but in a square with side length 1, the diagonal is √2 �

---------------

� 1.414, which is more than 1, so that's not allowed. 

Alternatively, arrange

---------------

 four clusters in a square with side length less than 1, so that the diagonal is at most 1. Then the side length would have to be at most 1/√2 ≈ 0.707. Then the distance between adjacent clusters is 0.707, and

---------------

 the diagonal would be 1. But then the distance between opposite vertices is 1. So if we have four clusters at the four

---------------

 corners of a square with side length 1/√2, then the distance between adjacent clusters is 1/√2, and the distance between opposite clusters is 1. 



---------------

But then, if we have, say, 3 points in each cluster, then total points would be 12. The

---------------

 total sum would be: 

First, between each pair of clusters: 

Adjacent clusters (distance 1/√2): each

---------------

 pair of adjacent clusters contributes 3*3*( (1/√2)^2 ) = 3*3*(0.5) = 4.5 per edge. There are 4 edges, so 4*4.5 = 18. 

Opposite clusters (distance 1): there

---------------

 are two pairs of opposite clusters (in a square, each cluster has one opposite). Each opposite pair contributes 3*3*(1^2) = 9. So

---------------

 two pairs give 18. 

Additionally, within each cluster, the distances are 0, so they contribute nothing. 

Total

---------------

 sum would be 18 (adjacent) + 18 (opposite) = 36. 

That

---------------

's worse than the three cluster case (48). So that's not better. 

Hmm, so three clusters give a

---------------

 better total. 

Alternatively, maybe arrange the points in three clusters but with different numbers? Suppose instead of 4 each, maybe

---------------

 5,4,3? Not sure if that would help, but let's see. Let me see the total cross

---------------

 terms. Suppose one cluster has a, b, c points, such that a + b + c = 12. Then the total cross pairs between the

---------------

 three clusters would be ab + ac + bc. To maximize ab + ac + bc given a + b + c = 12. 

Wait

---------------

, this is a known optimization problem. The maximum of ab + ac + bc under a + b + c = N is achieved when the variables are as equal as possible. So

---------------

 for N=12, the maximum is when a, b, c are 4,4,4, giving ab + ac + bc = 4*4 +4*4 +4*4 = 48. If

---------------

 they are 5,4,3, then it's 5*4 +5*3 +4*3 =20 +15 +12=47, which is less. So indeed

---------------

, equal distribution gives the maximum. 

Therefore, three clusters of 4 each is optimal for that configuration. 

Is there a better configuration than three clusters? Let's see. 



---------------

Suppose instead of three clusters, we have four clusters arranged in a regular tetrahedron... but that's 3D. In

---------------

 2D, we can't have four points with all pairs at 1 unit. 

Alternatively, arrange points in a

---------------

 three-dimensional configuration but projected onto the plane? Probably not, since projections might reduce distances. 

Alternatively, maybe arrange points not in

---------------

 clusters but in some other configuration where more pairs can have distance 1. For example, maybe a combination of clusters and some

---------------

 individual points. 

Suppose we have an equilateral triangle with three clusters (each with 4 points) as before. Then

---------------

, adding another point... but we have 12 points. Wait, three clusters of 4 gives exactly 12. So

---------------

 adding another cluster would require taking away points from others. 

Alternatively, maybe arrange points in a hexagon where each vertex has two points. Wait

---------------

, a regular hexagon with side length 1 would have opposite vertices at distance 2, which is too much. If

---------------

 the side length is 0.5, then opposite vertices are 1 unit apart. Let's see. 

Suppose we have a regular hexagon with side length 0.5. Then the distance between opposite vertices is 1.

---------------

 So if we place two points at each vertex, then the distance between two points at the same vertex is 0. The distance between points

---------------

 at adjacent vertices is 0.5, and between opposite vertices is 1. 

The total number of points is 12 (6 vertices ×

---------------

 2 points each). Let's compute the total sum. 

First, within each vertex (same cluster): 2 points, so 

---------------

1 pair each, but distance 0, so contributes 0. 

Between adjacent vertices: each edge of the hexagon has two points at each end. The distance between each

---------------

 pair across the edge is 0.5. The number of such pairs: each edge has 2×2 =4 pairs, and there are 6 edges. So total adjacent

---------------

 cross pairs contribute 6×4 × (0.5)^2 = 6×4×0.25 = 6×1 =6. 

Between vertices two apart (distance 

---------------

1 apart? Wait, in a regular hexagon with side 0.5, the distance between vertices two edges apart is 

---------------

1? Let me confirm. 

In a regular hexagon with side length s, the distance between two vertices separated by k steps is 2s sin(kπ/6). For

---------------

 k=1: 2s sin(π/6)=2s×0.5= s. So for s=0.5, that's 0.5. For k=2: 2s

---------------

 sin(2π/6)=2s sin(π/3)=2s*(√3/2)=s√3. With

---------------

 s=0.5, that's 0.5*1.732≈0.866, which is less than 1. Wait

---------------

, so the distance between vertices two apart is ~0.866, and between three apart (opposite) is 2s*(

---------------

sin(3π/6))=2s*1=2*0.5=1. 

Ah, so

---------------

 the opposite vertices are distance 1 apart. 

So vertices separated by 3 steps (opposite) are distance 1 apart. 



---------------

So between vertices separated by 1 step (adjacent): distance 0.5

Separated by 2 steps: ~0.866

Separated by 3 steps: 1.0

So

---------------

, for the hexagon with side 0.5 and two points per vertex:

Total pairs between vertices separated by 1 step: each

---------------

 edge has two vertices with two points each, so 2×2 pairs per edge, and 6 edges. Each contributes

---------------

 (0.5)^2. So 6 edges ×4 pairs ×0.25= 6×1=6 as

---------------

 before.

Between vertices separated by 2 steps: each such pair of vertices (there are 6 vertices, so each vertex has two vertices two steps away).

---------------

 For each vertex, the two vertices two steps away. So total pairs: for each vertex, 2 vertices ×2 points each

---------------

, so 2×2 pairs per vertex, but this counts each pair twice. So total number is (6 × 2 ×2)/2 = 12. Wait

---------------

, perhaps better to compute as follows:

Total number of vertex pairs separated by two steps: in a hexagon, each vertex has two vertices at two steps,

---------------

 so total number is 6×2 /2 =6. Each such vertex pair has two points each, so number of point pairs is 2×2=4 per vertex pair. So total is

---------------

 6×4=24. Each distance is ~0.866, so squared distance is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 =

---------------

 3/4. So total contribution is 24 × (3/4) = 18.

Between vertices separated by three steps (opposite): each vertex

---------------

 has one opposite vertex. There are 3 pairs of opposite vertices (since 6 vertices total). Each pair has two points each, so 2×2=4 pairs per vertex pair. So

---------------

 total pairs: 3×4=12. The squared distance is 1²=1. So contribution is 12×1=12.

Additionally

---------------

, the same-vertex pairs contribute 0.

Total sum is 6 (adjacent) + 18 (two steps) + 12 (opposite) = 36. 



---------------

Hmm, that's 36, which is less than the three cluster case of 48. So the three clusters are

---------------

 better. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, what if instead of three clusters, we arrange points in four clusters? Wait, but in

---------------

 2D, four points with all pairwise distances equal to 1 is impossible. So maybe arrange four clusters where each cluster is at

---------------

 a vertex of a square with side length 1/√2 so that the diagonals are 1. Let me see

---------------

:

Suppose we have a square with side length s, so the diagonal is s√2. To have the diagonal equal to 1, s

---------------

 must be 1/√2 ≈0.707. Then, the side length is 0.707. So

---------------

 the distance between adjacent clusters is 0.707, and opposite clusters are 1.0. 

If we have four clusters at

---------------

 the four corners of this square, each with 3 points (since 4×3=12), then the total cross

---------------

 pairs would be:

Adjacent clusters: each edge has 3×3 pairs. There are four edges. Each contributes (0

---------------

.707)^2 = 0.5. So 4 ×9 ×0.5 = 4×4.5 =18.

Opposite clusters: two pairs of opposite clusters

---------------

, each with 3×3 pairs, distance squared 1. So 2×9×1=18.

Other

---------------

 distances: clusters separated by a corner (distance sqrt( (s)^2 + (s)^2 )? Wait, no

---------------

. In a square, the distance between diagonal clusters is the diagonal of the square, which is 1. The distance between clusters

---------------

 not adjacent nor opposite? Wait, in a square, every pair is either adjacent or opposite. Wait no, in a square with four vertices, each pair is either adjacent (distance s) or opposite (distance sqrt

---------------

(2)s). Wait, but we set sqrt(2)s =1, so the distance between opposite is 1, and adjacent is s =1/√2≈

---------------

0.707. 

So for four clusters of 3 each:

Total sum contributions:

Adjacent pairs: 4 edges × (

---------------

3×3)*( (1/√2)^2 ) =4×9×0.5 =18.

Opposite pairs: 2 pairs × (3×3)*1²

---------------

 = 2×9 =18.

Total sum 36 again. 

Same as the hexagon case, less

---------------

 than the three cluster case. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe a different configuration. Let me think of another way. 



---------------

Suppose we have four points forming a square with side length 1, but then that square's diagonal is sqrt(2) which is too

---------------

 big. So that's invalid. 

Alternatively, a regular pentagon? Probably similar issues. 

Alternatively, perhaps arranging points

---------------

 in three clusters but with more points in some clusters. Wait, but earlier we saw that equal distribution gives the maximum for the

---------------

 cross terms. 

Alternatively, maybe not clusters but some other configuration where more distances are 1. For instance, if you

---------------

 can have multiple pairs at distance 1 without forcing other distances to exceed 1. 

Wait, perhaps arranging all 12 points as

---------------

 vertices of a regular 12-gon inscribed in a circle of radius r, such that the maximum distance between any two points is 1. The maximum distance in

---------------

 the 12-gon would be the diameter, so 2r =1, so r=0.5. Then

---------------

, similar to the hexagon case. 

In this case, the squared distance between two points separated by k steps is 2*(0.5)^2*(1 - cos(k*π/6))

---------------

 because the angle between adjacent vertices is 2π/12 = π/6. So for each pair separated by angle θ = k*(π/6), the squared distance is 0.5*(1 - cosθ). 

The

---------------

 total sum over all pairs would be the sum over all pairs of this value. 

Calculating this might be tedious, but perhaps we

---------------

 can compute it. Let me see:

There are C(12,2)=66 pairs. 

Each pair separated by k steps (for

---------------

 k=1 to 6, since beyond that it's symmetric). 

For each k from 1 to 6, the number of pairs separated by k steps is 12.

---------------

 Because in a 12-gon, each vertex has two vertices at each step, but when k=6, it's the diameter, so each vertex has only one opposite. Wait actually, in

---------------

 a 12-gon, for k from 1 to 5, each step k has 12 pairs (since for

---------------

 each vertex, there's one vertex k steps clockwise and one counter-clockwise, but when you count all, you have 12 for

---------------

 each k from 1 to 5, and for k=6, it's 6 pairs (each diameter counted once). 

Wait actually

---------------

, let me think again. In a regular n-gon, the number of pairs separated by k steps is n for each k from 1 to floor(n/2). So

---------------

 for n=12, for k=1 to 6:

For k=1 to 5: each has 12 pairs.



---------------

For k=6: 6 pairs (each diameter).

Therefore total pairs: 12×5 +6=66, which matches C(12,2)=66. 

So

---------------

 for each k from 1 to 6, compute the squared distance and multiply by the number of pairs.

The squared distance for angle

---------------

 θ = (kπ)/6 (since each step is π/6 radians).

Thus squared distance is 0.5*(1 - cos(kπ/6)).

Therefore

---------------

 total sum S is sum_{k=1}^6 [number of pairs * squared distance]

So:

For k=1 to

---------------

 5:

Each term is 12 * 0.5*(1 - cos(kπ/6))

For k=6:

6 * 0.5*(1 - cos(π)) [

---------------

since cos(π)= -1, so 1 - (-1)=2]

Compute each term:

First, let's compute for

---------------

 k from 1 to 5:

k=1:

cos(π/6)=√3/2 ≈0.866



---------------

So 1 - √3/2 ≈1 -0.866=0.134

Term

---------------

: 12 *0.5*(0.134)=6*0.134≈0.804

k=2:

cos(2π/6)=cos(π/3)=0.5

1 -0.5=0.5

Term:12 *0.5*0.5=12*0.25=3.0

k=3:

cos(3π/6)=cos(π/2)=0

1 -0=1

Term:12 *0.5*1=6.0

k=4:

cos(4π/6)=cos(2π/3)= -0.5

1 - (-0.5)=1.5

Term:12 *0.5*1.5=9.0

k=5:

cos(5π/6)=cos(π - π/6)= -cos(π/6)= -√3/2≈-0.866

1 - (-0.866)=1.866

Term:12 *0.5*1.866≈12*0.933≈11.196

Now

---------------

 for k=6:

cos(π)= -1, so 1 - (-1)=2

Term:6 *0.5*2=6*1=6.0

Now sum

---------------

 all these terms:

k=1: ~0.804

k=2: 3.0

k=3:6.0

k=4:9.0

k=5: ~11.196

k=6:6.0

Adding up:

0.804 +3 =3.804

+6=

---------------

9.804

+9=18.804

+11.196=30.0

+6=36.0

So total sum is 36.0

---------------

. 

Same as the two cluster case and the square and hexagon cases. Hmm, so arranging them equally spaced on a circle of diameter 1 gives total

---------------

 sum 36. But the three cluster case gives 48. So that's better. 

Therefore, the three cluster case

---------------

 is better. 

Wait, but is there a way to get even higher?

Suppose we have four clusters but with some

---------------

 distances less than 1, but more clusters? Hmm, but in 2D, you can't have four clusters with all pairwise distances exactly

---------------

 1. 

Alternatively, arrange the clusters in a three-dimensional simplex but projected onto 2D? Not sure. 



---------------

Alternatively, maybe arranging some points in clusters and others not. Let me think.

Suppose we have three clusters forming an equilateral triangle with side length 1, each cluster has 4 points. That

---------------

 gives 48. 

Alternatively, if we can have some points not in clusters but arranged such that they can have distance

---------------

 1 with more points. For example, adding a point in the center? But then the distance from the center to each cluster would have to be ≤0.5, since

---------------

 the clusters are 1 unit apart. Wait, let me think.

Suppose the three clusters are at the vertices of an equilateral triangle of side length 1. The

---------------

 center of the triangle is at a distance of (2/3)*height from each vertex. The height of the triangle is (sqrt(3)/2)*1.

---------------

 So the distance from center to each vertex is (2/3)*(sqrt(3)/2)= sqrt(3)/3≈0.577. So

---------------

 if we put a point at the center, its distance to each cluster is ~0.577 <1. So then

---------------

 we can have 12 points as three clusters of 4 and a central point? Wait but that would be 13 points. We

---------------

 need exactly 12. 

Alternatively, have three clusters of 3 each and three points at the center? Wait, 

---------------

3+3+3+3=12? No, that's 12. Wait, three clusters of 3 and

---------------

 three central points? Not sure. Let me see:

Suppose three clusters at the triangle vertices (each with 3 points) and three points

---------------

 at the center. Then, the distance from center to each cluster is ~0.577, so those are okay. The distance

---------------

 between the center points (if they are all at the center, then they have 0 distance among themselves). The distance between the

---------------

 central points and the clusters is ~0.577. The distance between clusters is 1. 

Then the total sum would be:

First

---------------

, the cross between the clusters:

Each pair of clusters (3 pairs) have 3×3 points each, distance 1.

---------------

 So 3*(9)*1=27.

Then, the central points (3) with each cluster: each central point is

---------------

 at distance ~0.577 from each cluster. Since there are three central points, each contributing to 3 clusters.

---------------

 

Wait, each central point is at the center, so distance to each cluster is same. 

The central points themselves:

---------------

 3 points at center, so the distance between them is 0, contributing nothing. 

The central points to each cluster: each

---------------

 central point has 3 points in each cluster, so for each central point, 3 clusters ×3 points each, so 9 pairs per

---------------

 central point. There are three central points, so total 27 pairs. Each distance is ~0.577, so squared is (sqrt(3)/3)^2 = 1/3 ≈0.333. So total contribution is

---------------

 27*(1/3)=9. 

Additionally, within the clusters: each cluster has 3 points, so C(3,2)=3 pairs each, but

---------------

 they are all at the same point (the cluster), so distance 0. So no contribution. 

Total sum: 27 (between clusters) +9 (center

---------------

 to clusters)=36. 

Which is less than the 48 from three clusters of 4 each. So that

---------------

's worse. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe having some clusters with more points and some with fewer but allowing some longer distances? Wait

---------------

, but all distances must be ≤1. 

Alternatively, perhaps arranging points in four clusters arranged as a regular tetrahedron on

---------------

 a sphere? But projected into 2D, distances might not all be ≤1. Not sure. 

Alternatively, think

---------------

 of the problem in terms of vectors. Let me denote each point as a vector in the plane. The sum of squared distances between all pairs is equal to (sum_{i<j} |P_i - P_j|^2). 

There is a formula for the sum of squared distances between all pairs of

---------------

 points. 

Recall that sum_{i<j} |P_i - P_j|^2 = (1/2) [ n sum |P_i|^2 - |sum P_i|^2 ] where n is the number of points. Wait, let me confirm

---------------

 this formula. 

Yes, the identity is:

sum_{i < j} |P_i - P_j|^2 = (1/2)[ n sum_{i=1}^n |P_i|^2 - |sum_{i=1}^n P_i|^2 ]

So perhaps

---------------

 using this identity could help. 

Let me denote S = sum_{i < j} |P_i P_j|^2.

---------------

 Then,

S = (1/2)[ 12 * (sum |P_i|²) - |sum P_i|² ]

To maximize S, given that all |P_i - P_j| ≤1 for i

---------------

 ≠ j. 

Hmm, so perhaps we can use this formula to find the maximum. 

Let me denote the centroid as G = (sum P_i)/12. Then,

---------------

 |sum P_i|² = (12)^2 |G|². 

So S = (1/2)[12 sum

---------------

 |P_i|² - 144 |G|² ] = 6 sum |P_i|² - 72 |G|².

---------------

 

Alternatively, written as S = 6 [ sum |P_i|² - 12 |G|² ].

Hmm

---------------

, so to maximize S, we need to maximize sum |P_i|² - 12 |G|². 

Alternatively, note

---------------

 that sum |P_i|² = sum |P_i - G + G|² = sum |P_i - G|² + 2 G •

---------------

 sum (P_i - G) + 12 |G|². But since sum (P_i - G) =0, this

---------------

 simplifies to sum |P_i - G|² + 12 |G|². 

Thus, sum |P_i|² - 12 |G|² = sum |P_i - G|². 

Therefore, S =6 * sum |P_i - G|². 

So

---------------

 the problem reduces to maximizing the sum of squared distances from the centroid. 

Therefore, to maximize S, we need to maximize the sum of squared distances from the centroid, given that all pairwise distances are at most 1. 

Hmm, interesting

---------------

. So perhaps arranging the points as far as possible from the centroid, but keeping all pairwise distances ≤1. 

Alternatively, the

---------------

 maximum of sum |P_i - G|² occurs when the points are as spread out as possible. 

If all points are at

---------------

 maximum distance from the centroid, but their mutual distances are also constrained. 

Alternatively, if all points are on the circumference of a circle of radius r, then the centroid is the center. Then sum

---------------

 |P_i - G|² = 12 r². 

In that case, S =6*(12 r²)=72 r². But

---------------

 the pairwise distances must be ≤1. The maximum distance between any two points is 2r, so 2r ≤1 →

---------------

 r ≤0.5. Thus S ≤72*(0.25)=18. But this is worse than the cluster cases

---------------

. 

Wait, so this suggests that arranging points on a circle with r=0.5 gives S=18, but previously

---------------

 when we calculated the regular 12-gon, we got 36. Wait, but according to the formula,

---------------

 if all points are on a circle of radius 0.5, then sum |P_i - G|² =12*(0.5)^2=3, so S=6*3=18. But earlier

---------------

 calculation gave 36. Contradiction? 

Ah, because in the regular 12-gon with radius 0.5, the sum

---------------

_{i<j}|P_i P_j|² was calculated as 36, but according to this formula, it should be 18. There

---------------

 must be an error here. 

Wait, let me recalculate using the formula. 

Suppose all points are on a circle of radius r.

---------------

 Then the centroid is the center, so G is the center. Then sum |P_i|² =12 r². 



---------------

Then S = (1/2)[12*(12 r²) - (12 G)^2 ] Wait

---------------

 no, sorry:

Wait the formula is S = (1/2)[n sum |P_i|² - |sum P_i|²]



---------------

Here, sum P_i =12 G, so |sum P_i|² = (12)^2 |G|². Since

---------------

 G is the centroid, if all points are on a circle with center G, then sum P_i =12 G,

---------------

 so |sum P_i|² = (12)^2 |G|². But if G is the origin (centroid

---------------

 at center), then G=0, so |sum P_i|²=0. 

Thus, in that case, S=(

---------------

1/2)[12*(12 r²) -0 ] = (1/2)(144 r²)=72 r². Wait, so

---------------

 if r=0.5, then S=72*(0.25)=18, but my previous direct

---------------

 calculation gave 36. 

Hmm, discrepancy here. There must be a miscalculation in one of the steps. 

Wait in

---------------

 my direct calculation for the regular 12-gon, I assumed radius 0.5 (so diameter 1), and

---------------

 computed the sum of squared distances between all pairs as 36. But according to the formula, it's 18. Which

---------------

 one is correct?

Wait let me check with a simple case. Let's take n=2 points. Two points at opposite

---------------

 ends of a diameter of a circle of radius r. Then the distance between them is 2r. The sum of squared distances is (2r)^2=4r². 

Using the formula: S=(1/2)[2*(2r²) - (2r)^

---------------

2 ]? Wait no, wait for two points at (-r,0) and (r,0). 

sum |P_i|² = r² + r² =2r²



---------------

sum P_i = (-r + r, 0 +0 ) =0. So |sum P_i|²=0. 

Thus S=(1/2)(2*(2r²) -0)= 2r². 

But actual sum is (2r)^2=4r². 



---------------

Wait, so discrepancy here. Wait the formula must be different. 

Wait I think I misremembered the formula. Let me re

---------------

derive it. 

The squared distance between two points P_i and P_j is |P_i - P_j|² = |P_i|² + |P_j|² - 2 P_i • P_j. 

Therefore, sum_{i<j} |P_i - P_j|² = sum_{i<j} (|P_i|² + |P_j|² - 2 P_i • P_j )

= sum_{i<j} |P_i|² + sum_{i<j} |P_j|² - 2 sum_{i<j} P_i • P_j 

Note

---------------

 that sum_{i<j} |P_i|² = sum_{i=1}^n |P_i|²*(n-1 - (i-1 terms

---------------

?)) Wait better:

Each |P_i|² appears in the first term for all j >i, so (n-1) times for

---------------

 each i. Similarly for the second term. 

Wait actually, in the first term, for each i, |P_i|² appears in all terms where i is the first index, so (n-1) terms. Similarly for the second term, each

---------------

 |P_j|² appears (n-1) times as the second term. 

Thus, sum_{i<j} (|P_i|² + |P_j|² ) = (n-1) sum_{i=1}^n |P_i|² 

Because

---------------

 for each |P_i|², it appears in (n-1) terms (paired with every j >i and

---------------

 j <i? Wait no, only j >i. Wait actually for each i, it is paired with j from i+1 to n, so (n -i) terms,

---------------

 but summed over all i from 1 to n-1. 

Alternatively, the total over all i<j of |P_i|² is equal to sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (n -i) |P_i|². But

---------------

 this is complicated. 

Alternatively, note that the total over all i≠j of |P_i|² is 2 sum_{i<j} |P_i|²,

---------------

 but actually no. Wait, perhaps better to note that sum_{i<j} (|P_i|² + |P_j|²) = sum_{i≠j} |P_i|².

---------------

 Because for each pair (i,j), i≠j, |P_i|² is counted once when i is first and once when i is second? Wait no.

---------------

 

Wait for each unordered pair {i,j}, the term |P_i|² + |P_j|² is added once. So

---------------

 the total is equal to the sum over all unordered pairs of (|P_i|² + |P_j|²)

---------------

 = sum_{i≠j} |P_i|². Because each |P_i|² is paired with every other |P_j|².

---------------

 Wait, no. 

Wait for each i, |P_i|² is added to the sum for every j >i. So the

---------------

 total sum is sum_{i=1}^n |P_i|²*(n -1). Because for each i

---------------

, it is in (n -1) pairs (with each j≠i). Wait yes! 

Wait actually, in

---------------

 the sum over all i < j of (|P_i|² + |P_j|²), each |P_i|² term

---------------

 appears in all pairs where it is the first element (i from 1 to n-1, and j from i+1 to n),

---------------

 so for each i, the number of times |P_i|² appears is (n -i). Similarly, for |

---------------

P_j|² terms, each |P_j|² appears in the number of pairs where it is the second element, which is (j -1). 



---------------

But overall, each |P_i|² appears exactly (n -1) times in the entire sum. Because for each point

---------------

 P_i, there are (n -1) other points P_j, so in the sum over all i < j, |

---------------

P_i|² appears in (n -1) terms where j >i, and |P_j|² appears in (n -1) terms where i <j. Wait,

---------------

 but in the sum over i <j, the total number of terms where |P_i|² appears is (n-1) for

---------------

 each i. 

Wait, perhaps it's simpler to note that the total sum over i <j (|P_i|² + |P_j|²) is equal to (sum_{i=1}^n |P_i|²) * (n -1). Because each |P_i|² is added

---------------

 (n-1) times (once for each j ≠i). 

Yes, that's correct. So:

sum_{i<j} (|P_i|² + |P_j|² ) = (n -1) sum_{i=1}^n |P_i|² 

Then, the cross term:

sum_{i<j} 

---------------

2 P_i • P_j = 2 sum_{i<j} P_i • P_j 

Note that sum_{i<j} P_i • P_j = (1/2)[ (sum_{i=1}^n P_i)^2 - sum_{i=1}^n |P_i|^2 ]

Because

---------------

 (sum P_i)^2 = sum |P_i|² + 2 sum_{i<j} P_i • P_j 

Therefore

---------------

, sum_{i<j} P_i • P_j = [ (sum P_i)^2 - sum |P_i|² ] /2 

Putting it

---------------

 all together:

sum_{i<j} |P_i - P_j|² = (n-1) sum |P_i|² - 2 * [ ( (sum P_i)^2 - sum |P_i|² ) /2 ]

Simplify:

= (n-1) sum |P_i|² - [ (sum P_i)^2 - sum |P_i|² ]

= (n -1) sum |P_i|² - sum P_i^2 + sum |P_i|² 

Wait,

---------------

 no, let me do it step by step:

Let me expand the terms:

First term: (n-1) sum |P_i|² 

Second term: -2 * [ ( (sum P_i)^2 - sum |P_i|² ) /2 ] = - [ (sum P_i)^2 - sum |P_i|² ]

Thus

---------------

, total:

(n-1) sum |P_i|² - (sum P_i)^2 + sum |P_i|² 

Combine like terms:

(n -1 +1) sum |P_i|² - (sum P_i)^2 

= n sum |P_i|² - (sum P_i)^2 

Therefore, the correct formula is:

sum_{i < j} |P_i - P_j|² = n sum |P_i|² - |sum P_i|² 

Wait

---------------

, so my initial formula was missing a factor of 1/2? Wait no, in the derivation above, I see

---------------

 that it is:

sum_{i<j} |P_i - P_j|² = n sum |P_i|² - |sum P_i|² 

Wait

---------------

 but let me test with n=2:

Two points at -r and +r on the x-axis. 

sum |P_i|² = r² + r² =2r² 

sum P_i = (-r + r)=

---------------

0 

Thus, the formula gives 2*(2r²) -0 =4r², which matches the actual squared

---------------

 distance (2r)^2=4r². Good. 

Earlier mistake was that I had a wrong factor. The correct formula is:



---------------

S = sum_{i<j} |P_i - P_j|² = n sum |P_i|² - |sum P_i|² 

So

---------------

 for the regular 12-gon case with radius 0.5, the centroid is the center, so sum P_i =0. 



---------------

Thus S =12*(12*(0.5)^2) -0 =12*(3)=36. Which matches the previous direct calculation. Ph

---------------

ew. 

So the formula is correct now. 

Therefore, to maximize S = n sum |P_i|² - |sum P_i|² 



---------------

Given n=12, and all pairwise distances ≤1. 

So to maximize S, we need to maximize 12 sum |P_i|² - |sum P_i|². 

Hmm

---------------

. To maximize this expression, perhaps we can consider that sum |P_i|² is maximized when the points are as far from the origin as possible, but subject

---------------

 to the distance constraints. However, the term |sum P_i|² can be minimized (ideally zero) to help

---------------

 maximize the total. 

Alternatively, if the centroid is at the origin (sum P_i=0), then S =12 sum |P_i|². So

---------------

 to maximize S, we need to maximize sum |P_i|², with the constraints that all pairwise distances are ≤1. 

Therefore

---------------

, the problem reduces to arranging 12 points in the plane with all pairwise distances ≤1, such that the sum of their squared distances from the origin is maximized, with

---------------

 the centroid at the origin. 

Alternatively, even if centroid isn't at origin, but the term |sum P_i|² complic

---------------

ates things. 

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when the centroid is at the origin. Let me assume that for maximum S, the centroid is at the origin.

---------------

 Because if not, we can translate the points so that centroid is at origin, which might not decrease the sum. 

Wait, actually

---------------

, if we have a configuration with centroid not at origin, then moving all points by a translation doesn't change the pairwise distances, so we can translate

---------------

 them so that centroid is at origin, which would set |sum P_i|²=0, so S=12 sum |P_i|². Since

---------------

 moving the points doesn't affect the pairwise distances, but allows us to possibly increase S by eliminating the |sum P_i|² term. 



---------------

Therefore, the maximum S is achieved when the centroid is at the origin, so S=12 sum |P_i|². Therefore

---------------

, we need to maximize sum |P_i|² with all pairwise distances ≤1 and centroid at origin. 

Therefore, the

---------------

 problem reduces to placing 12 points with centroid at origin, all pairwise distances ≤1, and maximize sum |P_i|². 

To

---------------

 maximize the sum of squared distances from the origin, the points should be as far as possible from the origin, but subject to the

---------------

 constraints. 

The maximum distance any point can be from the origin is constrained by the requirement that all pairwise distances are ≤1. 



---------------

Suppose one point is at distance R from the origin. Then any other point must be within distance ≤1 from it. So

---------------

 all other points must lie in the intersection of the disk of radius 1 around that point and the disk of radius something around the origin. 

This

---------------

 might be complex. Alternatively, perhaps the optimal configuration is the three clusters we considered earlier, arranged symmetrically around the origin. 

In

---------------

 the three cluster case (equilateral triangle with side length 1, each cluster at a vertex with 4 points), the

---------------

 centroid is the center of the triangle. Let's see:

Suppose the three clusters are at the vertices of an equilateral triangle with side length 1. Let me

---------------

 place the three vertices at coordinates:

Let’s place one cluster at (0,0), another at (1,0), and the third at (0.5, sqrt(3)/2). Wait

---------------

, but then the centroid of the entire set would be the average of all points. Since each cluster has 4 points, the centroid would be the average of the three cluster centers weighted

---------------

 by 4 each. 

The three cluster centers are at (0,0), (1,0), and (0.5, sqrt(3)/2). The centroid G

---------------

 would be:

G_x = [4*(0) +4*(1)+4*(0.5)] /12 = [0 +4 +2]/12 =6/12=0.5

G_y= [4*0 +4*0 +4*(sqrt(3)/2)]/12 = [2 sqrt(3)] /12 = sqrt(3)/6 ≈0.2887

---------------



Thus the centroid is not at the origin. Therefore, in this configuration, sum |P_i|² would be sum

---------------

 of each point's squared distance from origin, but the centroid isn't at origin, so the total S would be 12 sum |P_i|² - |sum P_i|². 

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps we can shift the clusters so that the centroid is at origin. Let me see.

Suppose we arrange the three clusters symmetrically around the origin. Let me

---------------

 place the three cluster centers at positions forming an equilateral triangle centered at the origin. 

Let each cluster be at a distance d from the origin, separated

---------------

 by 120 degrees. The distance between any two cluster centers would then be 2d sin(60°)= 2d*(√3/2)= d√3. 



---------------

We want this distance between clusters to be 1, so d√3 =1 → d=1/√3 ≈0.577. 

Thus

---------------

, each cluster is at distance 1/√3 from the origin, and the three cluster centers form an equilateral triangle of side length 1. 

Then

---------------

, the centroid of all 12 points (4 in each cluster) would be the average of the three cluster centers (

---------------

each multiplied by 4). Since the three cluster centers are symmetric around the origin, their average is the origin. 

Yes

---------------

, because each cluster is at (d, 0), (-d/2, d*(√3)/2), (-d/2, -d*(√3)/2). 



---------------

So the centroid would be:

sum P_i =4*(d,0) +4*(-d/2, d√3/2) +4*(-d/2, -d√3/2)

---------------

 

= (4d -2d -2d, 0 + 2d√3/2 - 2d√3/2 )

= (0,0). 

Thus

---------------

 the centroid is at origin. 

Therefore, in this configuration, the sum S is 12*(sum |P_i|²)

---------------

 because |sum P_i|²=0. 

Each point in a cluster is at distance d from the origin, so |P_i|² =d².

---------------

 Since there are 12 points, sum |P_i|² =12*d². 

Thus, S=12*(12*d²)=144*d². 

But

---------------

 d=1/√3, so d²=1/3, so S=144*(1/3)=48. Which matches the previous calculation where

---------------

 three clusters each with 4 points, separated by 1 unit, gave a total sum of 48. 

Therefore

---------------

, this configuration gives S=48, and this is the maximum? 

Is there a configuration where S can be higher? 

Suppose we try

---------------

 to place four clusters. Let's see. 

Suppose four clusters arranged in a square, each cluster at a vertex of a square with side length s, such that the distance between any two clusters is 1. 



---------------

Wait, in a square, the distance between adjacent clusters is s, and the distance between diagonal clusters is s√2. To have all pairwise distances ≤1, we

---------------

 need s√2 ≤1 → s ≤1/√2≈0.707. 

If we set s=1/√2, then the diagonal distance is 1. 

The

---------------

 four clusters would be at (s, s), (-s, s), etc. Wait, actually, placing them at (s,0), (0,s), (-s,0), (0,-s) to

---------------

 form a square rotated by 45 degrees, with vertices at distance sqrt(s² + s²)=s√2 from the origin. 



---------------

Wait, perhaps better to have a square with side length s, so the distance between adjacent clusters is s, and diagonals s√2. To have the

---------------

 maximum distance between any two clusters as 1, set s√2=1 → s=1/√2. 

The

---------------

 four clusters are at (s,0), (-s,0), (0,s), (0,-s). Each cluster has 3 points (total 12). 

The centroid is at the origin because

---------------

 of symmetry. 

Then, each point is at distance s from the origin, so |P_i|² =s²=

---------------

1/2. 

Thus, sum |P_i|² =12*(1/2)=6. 

H

---------------

ence S=12*6 -0=72? Wait, no, wait using the formula S= n sum |P_i|² - |sum P_i|².

---------------

 Here n=12, sum |P_i|²=12*(1/2)=6. 

So S=12*6 -0=72? Wait that

---------------

 can’t be right because the distances between clusters are s=1/√2≈0.707 and diagonally 1. 



---------------

Wait but the pairwise distances between points in different clusters: adjacent clusters are distance s apart, diagonal clusters are 1 apart. 

Wait the

---------------

 total sum of squared distances would be:

Between points in the same cluster: 0, since each cluster has 3 points at the same location. 

Between adjacent

---------------

 clusters: each cluster has 3 points, and each adjacent cluster also has 3. There are four edges in the square, each edge connecting two clusters. Each

---------------

 edge contributes 3×3 pairs with distance s. 

Total adjacent contributions:4 edges ×9 pairs × (s²)=4×9×(0.5)=18. 

Between diagonal clusters (distance 1): there

---------------

 are two diagonals in the square, each connecting two opposite clusters. Each diagonal has 3×3 pairs, distance 1. 

Total

---------------

 diagonal contributions:2×9×1²=18. 

Other distances: clusters not adjacent or opposite? In a square, each

---------------

 cluster is adjacent to two others and opposite to one. So all other pairs are accounted for. 

Total sum is 18 +18=36. 

Wait but according to the formula S=12 sum

---------------

 |P_i|² - |sum P_i|²= 12×6 -0=72. But

---------------

 direct calculation gives 36. Contradiction. 

Ah, because in this configuration, the points in each cluster are all

---------------

 at the same location. So the squared distance between two points in different clusters is either s² or 1², but the

---------------

 formula counts all pairs. 

Wait according to the formula, sum |P_i|² is sum over each point's squared distance from origin. Each of the 12 points is at distance s from the origin, so |

---------------

P_i|² = s² for each. Thus sum |P_i|² =12*(s²)=12*(0.5)=6. 



---------------

Then S=12×6 -0=72. But direct calculation gives 36. 

This discrepancy arises

---------------

 because when points are coincident (all in a cluster at a single point), the distance between two points in different clusters is the

---------------

 distance between their cluster centers. But in reality, if all points in a cluster are exactly at the cluster center, then the

---------------

 distance between any two points in different clusters is indeed the distance between their centers. So the direct calculation is correct, but the

---------------

 formula also should give the same. 

Wait let me recheck the formula. 

sum_{i<j} |P_i - P_j|².

---------------

 

If we have four clusters with three points each at four positions: A,B,C,D. 

Each cluster has 3 points,

---------------

 so total pairs between A and B:3×3=9, each with distance |A-B|. 

Similarly for A

---------------

-C, A-D, B-C, B-D, C-D. 

Wait in a square with four clusters at the four vertices:



---------------

Each cluster is at a vertex, so distance between adjacent clusters is s, non-adjacent (diagonal) is s√2. 

Wait in

---------------

 my previous setup, I considered the clusters at (s,0), (-s,0), (0,s), (0,-s). Then

---------------

 the distance between (s,0) and (0,s) is sqrt(s² + s²)=s√2. 



---------------

But if we set s√2 =1 (so s=1/√2), then the diagonal distance is 1. 



---------------

Then, the distance between adjacent clusters (e.g., (s,0) to (0,s)) is s√2=1. Wait,

---------------

 no, adjacent clusters in the square as I placed them would actually be separated by distance sqrt{(s -0)^2 + (0 -s)^2}=sqrt

---------------

(2)s. Wait, actually in that configuration, all pairs of clusters are separated by distance s√2. Wait no

---------------

:

Wait the four clusters are at (s,0), (-s,0), (0,s), (0,-s). 

The distance between (s,0) and (0,s) is sqrt(s² + s²)=s√2. 

Similarly between any two non-opposite clusters.

---------------

 The distance between (s,0) and (-s,0) is 2s. 

Ah! So if we

---------------

 want all distances between clusters to be ≤1, then both 2s and s√2 must be ≤1. 

To

---------------

 have 2s ≤1 → s ≤0.5 

and s√2 ≤1 → s ≤1/√2 ≈0.707. 

Thus

---------------

 the stricter condition is s ≤0.5. 

If we set s=0.5, then the distance between opposite clusters (like

---------------

 (s,0) and (-s,0)) is 1, and the distance between non-opposite clusters is sqrt(0.5² +0.5²)=sqrt(0.5)=≈0.707.

---------------

 

Thus, with s=0.5, all pairwise distances between clusters are ≤1. 

Then, the total sum would

---------------

 be:

Between adjacent clusters (distance 0.707):

Each pair of non-opposite clusters: there are four clusters. Each cluster has two non-opposite clusters at

---------------

 distance s√2≈0.707. Wait no, let's count properly:

The four clusters are at positions

---------------

:

A: (0.5,0)

B: (-0.5,0)

C: (0,0.5)

D: (0,-0.5)

Distance

---------------

 between A and C: sqrt(0.5² +0.5²)=sqrt(0.5)≈0.707

Distance between A and B: 1.0

Distance between A and D: same as A and C,

---------------

 ~0.707

Similarly for others. 

So for each cluster, it has two clusters at distance ~0.707 and one at distance 1.0 (opposite). 

Wait

---------------

 for cluster A (0.5,0):

Opposite cluster is B (-0.5,0), distance 1.0.



---------------

The other two clusters (C and D) are at distance sqrt(0.5) each. 

So for each cluster, there

---------------

 are two clusters at distance sqrt(0.5) and one at distance 1.0. 

Thus total pairs between clusters:

Between

---------------

 A and B: distance 1.0, 3×3=9 pairs. 

Between A and C: distance sqrt(0.5), 3×3=9 pairs. 

Similarly A

---------------

 and D: same as A and C. 

Same for other clusters. 

Total contributions:

Opposite pairs (A-B, C-D, etc

---------------

.): there are two pairs of opposites (A-B and C-D). Each contributes 9×1²=9. So total opposite

---------------

:2×9=18.

The non-opposite pairs (like A-C, A-D, B-C, B-D, etc.)

---------------

:

Each cluster has two non-opposite clusters at distance sqrt(0.5). For each cluster, two such clusters. 



---------------

Total number of such pairs: 

Each non-opposite pair is counted twice (e.g., A-C and C-A), so total unique non-opposite pairs are 

---------------

4 clusters ×2 /2 =4. Each pair has distance sqrt(0.5). Each pair has 3×3=9 pairs.

---------------

 

Thus contribution:4×9× (0.5) =4×4.5=18. 

Wait

---------------

 let me recount carefully:

Total number of non-opposite pairs:

Between A and C:1 pair

A and D:1 pair

B and C:1 pair

B and D:1 pair

C and A: same as A and C



---------------

Wait actually, for four clusters, the non-opposite pairs are:

A-C, A-D, B-C, B-D, C-A is

---------------

 same as A-C etc. So total 4 unique non-opposite pairs. 

Each contributes 9 pairs of points,

---------------

 with squared distance 0.5. 

Total non-opposite contribution:4×9×0.5=18. 

Opp

---------------

osite contributions:2 pairs (A-B and C-D) each with 9 pairs, squared distance 1. Total 18. 

Additionally

---------------

, between the other two opposite pairs? Wait C and D are opposites, yes. Wait A and B are opposites, C and D are opposites. 



---------------

Total opposite pairs are two: (A,B) and (C,D). 

Thus total sum:18+18=36. 

Using

---------------

 the formula, with s=0.5, the points are at distance 0.5 from the origin. So sum |P_i|² =12*(0.5)^2=3. 



---------------

Thus S=12×3 -0=36, which matches the direct calculation. 

Therefore, the formula works

---------------

. 

Thus, the three cluster configuration (equilateral triangle with clusters at vertices distance 1 apart, each cluster with 4 points, centroid at origin) gives S=48, which is higher than the square

---------------

 case's 36. 

Is there a configuration where S is higher than 48?

Suppose we try with

---------------

 four clusters but arranged differently? 

Alternatively, maybe arrange the clusters in a different symmetric configuration. 

Suppose we have four

---------------

 clusters arranged in a regular tetrahedron configuration, but projected onto the plane. Wait, but in 2D, we

---------------

 can't have four points with all pairwise distances equal. 

Alternatively, arrange three clusters as before but with more points in each

---------------

. Wait, but we need exactly 12 points. 

Alternatively, adding another cluster but with fewer points. 

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 arrange points not in clusters but in some other symmetric fashion. 

Wait let's think again of the three cluster case. 



---------------

Each cluster is at a vertex of an equilateral triangle with side length 1, centroid at origin, each cluster has 4 points. 

The

---------------

 distance from each cluster to the origin is d=1/√3≈0.577. 

Thus, each point is at distance d from the origin, so |

---------------

P_i|²=d²=1/3. 

Sum |P_i|²=12*(1/3)=4. 

Then

---------------

 S=12*4 -0=48. 

Is it possible to have a configuration where the points are further from the origin?

---------------

 

Suppose we have two clusters instead of three. Let's try two clusters arranged on opposite sides of the origin, separated by distance 1. Each cluster has 6 points. 

The

---------------

 centroid is at the origin because of symmetry. 

Each cluster is at distance 0.5 from the origin. 

Thus each point is at distance 0.5 from the origin, so sum |P_i|²=12*(0.25)=3. 

Thus

---------------

 S=12×3 -0=36. 

Less than 48. 

Alternatively, three clusters but

---------------

 with some points further out? 

Suppose instead of placing all points exactly at the cluster centers, we spread them out a

---------------

 bit. But then the pairwise distances between points in different clusters might exceed 1. 

Alternatively, suppose we have three clusters forming

---------------

 an equilateral triangle of side length 1, but with points not all coinciding at the vertices. 

For example, each

---------------

 cluster is a small group of points around each vertex, such that the distance between any two points in different clusters is still 

---------------

1. But arranging points around the vertices would require that the clusters are very tight (points at the vertices), otherwise the distance between points in different clusters might

---------------

 exceed 1. 

Alternatively, maybe arranging points in a hexagon with two points per vertex, but adjusted so that distances

---------------

 between non-adjacent vertices are within 1. But earlier calculations showed that gives 36. 

Alternatively, let

---------------

's consider another configuration: six pairs of points, each pair separated by 1 unit, and arranged such that all other distances are ≤

---------------

1. 

Imagine six pairs arranged as three perpendicular diameters of a circle with radius 0.5. Each diameter has two points at the ends, separated

---------------

 by 1 unit. There are three diameters at 60-degree angles. 

So, for example, points at (0.5,0), (-0.5,0), (0.5*cos60, 0.5*sin60), etc. 



---------------

Wait let's see:

Let me place three diameters at angles 0°, 120°, 240°. Each diameter has two points at distance

---------------

 0.5 from the origin, so the distance between the two points on a diameter is 1. 

The angle between any two diameters is 120°, so the distance between a point on one diameter and a point on another diameter

---------------

 can be calculated. 

Take two points on different diameters: say (0.5,0) and (0.5*cos120°, 0.5*sin120°). 

The

---------------

 coordinates are (0.5, 0) and (0.5*(-0.5), 0.5*(√3/2)) = (-0.25, (√3)/4). 

The distance between them is sqrt( (0.5 +0.25)^2 + (0 - (√3)/4)^2 ) 

= sqrt( (0.75)^2 + ( (√3)/4 )^2 )

= sqrt(0.5625 + 0.1875 )



---------------

= sqrt(0.75) ≈0.866, which is less than 1. 

The

---------------

 maximum distance between any two points would be between points on the same diameter (1 unit) or between points on different diameters.

---------------

 The maximum among the latter is sqrt(0.75) ≈0.866. 

Therefore, all pairwise distances are ≤1. 

Each

---------------

 diameter has two points, so total points are 6. But we need 12 points. 

Hmm, so if

---------------

 we have three diameters, each with four points (two at each end), then total 12 points. 

Wait, each

---------------

 diameter can have two points at each end, but to have four points on a diameter, spaced how? 

Wait, if

---------------

 each diameter has two points at each end (total four points per diameter), but that would mean two points at each end of

---------------

 the diameter. 

Wait, perhaps two points at each end of each diameter, so each diameter contributes four points. Three diameters would give 12 points. 

Each

---------------

 point is at a distance of 0.5 from the origin. 

The distance between two points on the same diameter would

---------------

 be 1 unit (if they are at opposite ends) or 0 (if at the same end). 

Wait, let

---------------

 me clarify:

Suppose each diameter has two points at each end, so for a diameter along the x-axis: two points at (0.5, 0), two at (-0.5,0). Similarly for the other two diameters at 120° and 240°. 

Thus

---------------

 each diameter has four points: two at each end. 

Total points: 3 diameters ×4 points=12 points. 

Now, the

---------------

 distance between two points on the same diameter:

- Points at the same end: distance 0. 

- Points at opposite ends: distance 1. 

Between

---------------

 points on different diameters: 

Take two points on different diameters. For instance, a point at (0.5,0) and a point on another diameter,

---------------

 say at (0.5*cos120°,0.5*sin120°)= (-0.25, ~

---------------

0.433). 

The distance between these two points is sqrt( (0.5 +0.25)^2 + (0 -0.433)^2 )

= sqrt(0.75² +0.433²)=

---------------

 sqrt(0.5625 +0.1875)=sqrt(0.75)=≈0.866 as

---------------

 before. 

Similarly between other points. 

Thus all distances are ≤1. 

Now compute the total sum S. 

First, note

---------------

 that each point is at distance 0.5 from the origin, so sum |P_i|²=12*(0.25)=3. Thus S

---------------

=12×3 -0=36. 

Same as previous cases. 

Hmm, so that's not better. 

Alternatively

---------------

, maybe arranging points in a three-dimensional configuration but projected into 2D? Probably not helpful as distances would be distorted. 

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps the three-cluster case is indeed the best. 

Another thought: What if we have four clusters arranged as a regular tetrahedron in

---------------

 3D, but since we are confined to the plane, perhaps arranging them in a way that approximates that? But

---------------

 in 2D, it's impossible to have four points all mutually at distance 1. 

Alternatively, arrange points in a

---------------

 different symmetric polygon. For example, a square with side length 1, but with three points at each corner. Wait, four

---------------

 corners with three points each gives 12 points. 

But the distance between adjacent corners is 1, which is okay. The distance between diagonal corners is sqrt(2) >

---------------

1, which violates the condition. So that won't work. 

Alternatively, a square with side length 1/sqrt(2), so that

---------------

 diagonal is 1. 

Then, side length s =1/sqrt(2), so adjacent distance is 1/sqrt(2)≈0.707, diagonal

---------------

 is 1. 

Placing three points at each corner (total 12). 

The centroid is at the center. 

The

---------------

 distance from each point to the center is sqrt( (s/2)^2 + (s/2)^2 )=s

---------------

/√2= (1/sqrt(2))/sqrt(2)=1/2. 

Thus each point is at distance 0.5 from center. 

Then

---------------

 sum |P_i|²=12*(0.25)=3. So S=36 again. 

Hmm

---------------

. 

So far, the best configuration I can find is the three cluster case giving S=48. 

Is there any other

---------------

 configuration that can give a higher value? 

Suppose we try with six clusters arranged as vertices of a regular hexagon with side length 0.5. Each

---------------

 cluster has two points. 

The distance between adjacent clusters is 0.5, between opposite clusters is 1.0. 

The

---------------

 centroid is at the center. 

Each point is at distance r from the center, where r is the radius of the hexagon. For a regular hexagon with side length s, the radius is s. So here, r=0.5. 

Thus each point is at 0.5 from center, so sum |P_i|²=12*(0.25)=3 ⇒

---------------

 S=36. 

Same as others. 

Alternatively, suppose we have four clusters arranged in a square with side length 1, but with

---------------

 three points each, but that would have diagonal sqrt(2) >1, so invalid. 

Alternatively, arrange points in a

---------------

 different symmetric shape. 

Wait, maybe the three cluster case is indeed the optimal. Let me see if there's a way

---------------

 to prove that 48 is the maximum. 

Suppose that in any configuration, the maximum sum is achieved when the points are divided

---------------

 into three clusters at the vertices of an equilateral triangle with side length 1, each cluster containing 4 points. 

Alternatively

---------------

, using the formula S = n sum |P_i|² - |sum P_i|², to maximize S, we need to maximize sum |P_i|².

---------------

 

The maximum possible sum |P_i|² is achieved when the points are as far as possible from the origin, but

---------------

 with all pairwise distances ≤1. 

If the points are arranged in three clusters at the vertices of an equilateral triangle of side length 1, placed

---------------

 symmetrically around the origin, each at distance d from the origin where d=1/√3. 

Then, the

---------------

 distance between any two clusters is 1, and each point is at distance d from the origin. 

This seems to maximize

---------------

 the individual distances from the origin because any point further out would require other points to be closer, but constrained by the pairwise distances. 

Suppose we

---------------

 try to place four points at a larger distance from the origin. Let's say four points placed at the vertices of a square with side

---------------

 length s, but this might not help as seen before. 

Alternatively, if we try to place points in four clusters arranged

---------------

 in a square with side length 1/√3, but that might not give a better sum. 

Alternatively, consider

---------------

 that in the three cluster case, each point is as far from the origin as possible given the constraints. Since the clusters are placed

---------------

 at the vertices of a triangle with side 1, the distance from the centroid to each vertex is 1/√3. 



---------------

Any other configuration where points are further from the origin would require that the distance between some pair of points exceeds 1. For example, if a point is placed at distance greater than 1/√3 from the origin, then another point in

---------------

 another cluster would have to be within distance 1 from it, which might pull that point closer to the origin, reducing the overall sum. 

Therefore

---------------

, the three cluster configuration might indeed be optimal. 

Therefore, the maximum possible value is 48. 

**Final Answer**
\boxed{48}


To solve the problem of finding the maximum possible value of the sum of the squares of the distances between all pairs of 12 points in the plane, where each pair of points is at most 1 unit apart, we consider various configurations of points and

---------------

 use geometric and algebraic reasoning.

1. **Key Formula**: The sum of squared distances between all pairs of points can be expressed using the formula:
   \[
   \sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} |P_i P_j|^2 = n \sum_{i=1}^n |P_i|^2 - \left| \sum_{i=1}^n P_i \right|^2
   \]
   where \( n = 12 \).



---------------

2. **Cluster Configuration**: We consider arranging the points into clusters such that the distance between any two clusters is exactly 1 unit. The optimal configuration is found by placing

---------------

 the points in three clusters forming an equilateral triangle with side length 1, each cluster containing 4 points. This configuration ensures all

---------------

 pairwise distances between points in different clusters are 1 unit, and the centroid of the entire set is at the origin, simpl

---------------

ifying calculations.

3. **Distance Calculation**: 
   - Each cluster is placed at a vertex of an equilateral triangle with side length 1.
   - The distance from each cluster to the origin (centroid) is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \).
   - Each point is at a distance of \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \) from the origin, so the squared distance is

---------------

 \( \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3} \).

4. **Sum of Squared Distances**:
   - The sum of the squared distances from each point to the origin is \( 12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \).
   - Using the formula, the total sum of squared distances between all pairs is:
     \[
     12 \times 4 - 0 = 48
     \]

5. **Verification**: Other configurations such as two clusters, square arrangements, or hexagons were considered but resulted in lower sums due

---------------

 to constraints on distances and centroid placement.

Thus, the maximum possible value of the sum of the squares of the distances between all pairs of 12 points is:

\[
\boxed{48}
