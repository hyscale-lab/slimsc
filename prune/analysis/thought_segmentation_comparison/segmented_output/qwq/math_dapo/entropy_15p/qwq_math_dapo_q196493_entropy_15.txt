Okay, let's see. I need to find the probability that the sum of two dice is odd. But these aren't regular dice. One die has the 4 replaced by 3, and the other has the 3 replaced by 4. Hmm. Alright

---------------

, let me break this down step by step.

First, I should figure out what each die actually looks like. Let's call the first die Die A, which has the 4 replaced by 3. So,

---------------

 normally a die has numbers 1 through 6. If Die A replaces 4 with 3, then its faces are: 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 6. Wait, so

---------------

 there are two 3s on Die A? That's important. The second die, Die B, has the 3 replaced by 4. So its faces are 1, 2, 4, 4, 5, 6. So

---------------

 Die B has two 4s. Okay, got that.

Now, since both dice are fair, each face has an equal probability of 1/6. But because

---------------

 of the duplicates, some numbers are more likely? Wait no, actually, each face is equally likely, but since Die A has two 3s, the probability of rolling a 3 on Die A is 2/6 = 1/3, whereas

---------------

 the probability of rolling a 4 on Die A is 0, since it was replaced. Similarly, Die B has two 4s, so the probability of rolling a 4 on Die B is 2/6 = 1/3, and the probability of rolling a 3 on Die B is 0. Got

---------------

 it.

Now, the question is the probability that the sum is odd. Remember that the sum of two numbers is odd if one is even and the other is odd. So, the

---------------

 two dice must show numbers of opposite parity (one even, one odd). Therefore, the probability we're looking for is the probability that Die A is even and Die B is odd, plus the probability that Die A is odd and Die B is even.

So, first

---------------

, let's figure out the number of even and odd numbers on each die.

Starting with Die A (the one with two 3s):

Numbers

---------------

 on Die A: 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 6.

Let's list them:



---------------

- 1: odd

- 2: even

- 3: odd

- 3: odd

- 5: odd

- 6: even

So, how

---------------

 many even numbers? 2 and 6, so two evens. The rest are odd: 1,3,3,5. That's four odds. Wait

---------------

, 1,3,3,5: four numbers. So Die A has 2 evens and 4 odds. Therefore, the probability Die A is even is 2/6 = 1/3, and odd is 4/6 = 2/3.

Now Die B (the one with two 4s):

Numbers on Die B: 1, 2, 4, 4, 5, 6.

Listing

---------------

 them:

- 1: odd

- 2: even

- 4: even

- 4: even

- 5: odd

- 6: even

So,

---------------

 how many evens here? 2,4,4,6. That's four even numbers. The odd numbers are 1 and 5: two odds. Therefore, Die B has 4 evens and 2 odds. So the probability Die B is even is 4/6 = 2/3, and odd is 2/6 = 1/3.

Alright

---------------

, so now, the total probability of the sum being odd is:

P(A even and B odd) + P(A odd and B even)

Calcul

---------------

ating each term:

First term: P(A even) * P(B odd) = (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9

Second term: P(A odd) * P(B even) = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9

Wait, hold on. Wait, let

---------------

 me check again. Wait, Die B's even probability is 4/6 which is 2/3, right? So:



---------------

Wait, first term: A even (1/3) times B odd (1/3) = 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9

Second term: A odd (2/3) times B even (2/3) =

---------------

 2/3 * 2/3 = 4/9

Wait, but adding those together gives 1/9 + 4/9 = 5/9. Hmm. But

---------------

 let me make sure I didn't miscalculate.

Wait, hold on. Let me verify again the counts for each die.



---------------

For Die A:

Numbers: 1 (odd), 2 (even), 3 (odd), 3 (odd), 5 (odd), 6 (even). So total

---------------

 evens: 2 (2 and 6). Odds: 4 (1,3,3,5). So that

---------------

's correct.

For Die B:

Numbers:1 (odd), 2 (even),4 (even),4 (even),5 (odd),6 (even). So evens: 2,4,4,6.

---------------

 That's four, so 4/6. Odds:1 and 5, so two, which is 2/6. Correct

---------------

.

Therefore, the probabilities are correct. So then P(A even) = 1/3, P(B odd)=1/3, so 

---------------

1/3*1/3 = 1/9. P(A odd)=2/3, P(B even)=2/3,

---------------

 so 2/3*2/3 = 4/9. Then total is 5/9. Hmm. So

---------------

 is that the answer? Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again.

Wait, hold on. Maybe I need

---------------

 to think in terms of actual possible outcomes and count the number of favorable outcomes over total outcomes.

Because sometimes when there are duplicates on the dice, the

---------------

 possible outcomes might not be all equally likely? Wait, but the problem states that each face is equally likely. So even though Die A has two 3s, each face (including the two 3s) has a 1/6 chance. Similarly for Die B's two 4s. So the

---------------

 total number of possible outcomes when rolling both dice is 6*6 = 36, each with equal probability.

Therefore, perhaps

---------------

 I can model each die's numbers as their faces, even with duplicates, so Die A is [1,2,3,3,5,6], and Die B is [1,2,4,4,5,6]. Each

---------------

 face is distinct in terms of their positions, even if numbers repeat. So each of the 36 pairs is equally likely. Therefore, perhaps

---------------

 I can compute the number of pairs where the sum is odd.

Alternatively, since the calculation above gave 5/9, but let me confirm

---------------

 by counting.

Let me list all possibilities.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it by considering the parity contributions.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 my first approach was correct, but let me check again.

Wait, if Die A has 4 odd numbers and 2 even numbers, so

---------------

 the chance of A being odd is 4/6 = 2/3, and even is 1/3. Die B has 4 even and 2 odd, so chance

---------------

 of even is 2/3, odd is 1/3. Therefore, the probability of (A even, B odd) is (1/3)(1/3)=1/9, and (A odd, B even) is (2/3)(2/3)=4/9, so total 5/9. So

---------------

 that's 5/9. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake here. Wait, hold on. Wait, Die

---------------

 B's even probability is 4/6 which is 2/3. So (A odd) is 2/3, (

---------------

B even) is 2/3, so their product is (2/3)(2/3)=4/9. Then

---------------

 adding 1/9 gives 5/9. So that's 5/9. Hmm. But let's see

---------------

, maybe there's a mistake here because the dice have duplicate numbers but different counts. Maybe the actual number of combinations where the sum is odd is different?

Alternatively, let

---------------

's compute it manually.

Let me consider Die A and Die B's numbers:

Die A: [1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 6]

Die B: [1, 2, 4, 4, 5, 6]

Now

---------------

, let me compute all possible pairs and count how many have an odd sum.

Alternatively, maybe compute the number of pairs where one

---------------

 is even and the other is odd.

First, count the number of even numbers on Die A: 2 (2 and 6)

The number of odd numbers on Die A: 4 (1,3,3,5)

Number

---------------

 of even numbers on Die B: 4 (2,4,4,6)

Number of odd numbers on Die B: 2 (1,5)

Therefore, the number of pairs where Die A is even and Die B is odd: (number of evens on A) * (number of odds on B) = 2 * 2 =4

The

---------------

 number of pairs where Die A is odd and Die B is even: (number of odds on A)*(number of evens on B)=4 *4=16

So

---------------

 total favorable pairs: 4 +16=20

Total possible pairs: 6*6=36

Therefore, probability is 20/36=5/9. Okay

---------------

, that matches the earlier result. So that's good.

Wait, but let me make sure that when we count the numbers of

---------------

 evens and odds, even with duplicates, each face is considered a separate outcome. For example, Die A has two 3s, so when paired

---------------

 with Die B's numbers, each 3 on Die A is a separate face, so each combination is counted separately. Similarly

---------------

 for Die B's two 4s.

Therefore, in terms of counts, the number of even numbers on Die A is indeed 2 (faces

---------------

 with 2 and 6), so 2 options. The odd numbers on Die A are 4 faces: 1,3,3,5. So

---------------

 4 options. So when pairing, for the first case (A even, B odd), each even on A (2 choices

---------------

) can pair with each odd on B (2 choices: 1 and 5 on Die B). Since Die B has two 

---------------

1s? Wait no. Wait, Die B's odd numbers are 1 and 5. Each of those is one

---------------

 face. Wait, no, Die B's numbers are [1,2,4,4,5,6]. So the odd numbers on Die B are 1 and 5. Each is

---------------

 a single face. So there are two odd numbers on Die B, each on one face. So the number of odd faces on Die B is two.

---------------

 So when Die A is even (2 faces) and Die B is odd (2 faces), the number of such combinations is 2 * 2 =4.

Similarly, Die

---------------

 A's odd faces are 4 (the 1, 3, 3, 5), so four faces, and Die B's even faces are four (2,4,4,6). So 

---------------

4 *4 =16.

Therefore, total is 20, over 36. 20/36 simplifies to 5/9. So that

---------------

 seems correct.

Therefore, the probability is 5/9, so k is 5 and m is 9, so k + m =14. Wait

---------------

, but hold on, let me check once more to be absolutely sure.

Wait, let me actually list all possibilities for Die

---------------

 A and Die B. But that might take time, but maybe for a few cases.

Alternatively, let me think of the

---------------

 possible numbers:

For Die A, the numbers are 1,2,3,3,5,6.

For Die B, numbers are 1,2,4,4,5,6.

Let

---------------

 me compute the number of pairs where sum is odd.

First, take each number on Die A and see how many numbers on Die B will

---------------

 give an odd sum.

Starting with Die A's 1 (odd):

To get an odd sum, Die B must be even. Die B has 

---------------

2,4,4,6 (four evens). So 4 options. So 4 pairs here.

Next, Die A's 2 (even):

To get odd sum, Die B must be odd. Die B's odd numbers are 1 and 5. So two options. So 2 pairs.

Die A's 3 (odd):

Same as 

---------------

1. So Die B needs to be even. 4 options. So 4 pairs. But there are two 3s on Die A, so each

---------------

 3 will have 4 options. So total for both 3s: 2 *4 =8? Wait, hold

---------------

 on.

Wait, actually, let's do this step by step:

Take each face of Die A one by one:

First face of Die A: 1 (odd):

Pair

---------------

 with each face of Die B:

1 (odd): sum 2 (even) → no.

2 (even): sum 3 (odd) → yes.

4 (even): sum 5 (odd) → yes.

4 (even): sum 5 (odd) → yes.

5 (odd): sum 6 (even) → no.

6 (even): sum 7 (odd) → yes.

So for Die A's

---------------

 first face (1), the number of B faces giving odd sum: 2,4,4,6 → that's four.

---------------

 So 4.

Second face of Die A: 2 (even):

Pair with each of Die B's faces:

1 → sum 3 (odd) → yes.

2 → 4 (even) → no.

4 → 6 (even) → no.

4 → 6 (even) → no.

5 →7 (odd) → yes.

6 →8 (even) → no.

So only

---------------

 two: 1 and 5. So two.

Third face of Die A: 3 (odd):

Same as the first face (1). So pairing

---------------

 with Die B's numbers, same as before. So again 4.

Fourth face of Die A: 3 (odd):



---------------

Same as above, another 4.

Fifth face of Die A: 5 (odd):

Same as 1 and 3. Pairing with Die B's evens.

---------------

 So 4 again.

Sixth face of Die A: 6 (even):

Similar to the second face (2). Let

---------------

's see:

Pair with Die B's faces:

1 →7 (odd) → yes.

2 →8 (even) → no.

4 →10 (even) → no.

4 →10 (even) → no.

5 →11 (odd) → yes.

6 →12 (even) → no.

So two

---------------

 again (1 and 5).

So let's add up all these:

First face (1):4

Second face (2):2

Third face (3):4

Fourth face (3):4

Fifth face (5):4

Sixth face (6):2

Total:

---------------

 4 +2 +4 +4 +4 +2 = 20. Yep, that's 20. So over

---------------

 36 total, so 20/36 reduces to 5/9. So that's correct.

Therefore, the probability is 5/9, so k is

---------------

 5, m is 9, so k + m =14. Therefore, the answer is 14.

Wait, but let

---------------

 me check again if the problem mentions anything about the dice being distinguishable. Since they are two different dice, one with the 4 replaced by 3 and the other with 3 replaced by 4, so they

---------------

 are different. So when we count the outcomes, each die is separate, so the 36 pairs are indeed all distinct

---------------

 and equally likely. So the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, maybe there is a trick here I missed?

Wait, the problem says "two six-sided dice are fair in the sense that each face is equally likely to turn up". So each face, regardless of number, has probability 1/6. So even though Die A has two 3s, each of those faces is 

---------------

1/6. So yes, the calculation is correct. So I think 5/9 is correct. Therefore, the

---------------

 answer is 14.

**Final Answer**
Answer: 14


To find the probability that the sum of two modified six-sided dice is odd, we first analyze each die:

- **Die A** (with 4 replaced by 3): Faces are [1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 6]. This die has 4 odd numbers (1, 3, 3, 5) and 2 even numbers (2, 6).
- **Die B** (with 3 replaced by 4): Faces are [1, 2, 4, 4, 5, 6]. This die has 2 odd numbers (1, 5) and 4 even numbers (2, 4, 4, 6).

The sum of two numbers is odd if one is even and the other is odd. We calculate the probabilities for each case:

1. **Probability Die A is even and Die B is odd**:
   - Probability Die A is even: \( \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \)
   - Probability Die B is odd: \( \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \)
   - Combined probability: \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{9} \)

2. **Probability Die A is odd and Die B is even**:
   - Probability Die A is odd: \( \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \)
   - Probability Die B is even: \( \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \)
   - Combined probability: \( \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{9} \)

Adding these probabilities gives the total probability of an odd sum:
\[ \frac{1}{9} + \frac{4}{9} = \frac{5}{9} \]

The fraction \(\frac{5}{9}\) simplifies to \( \frac{5}{9} \), so \( k = 5 \) and \( m = 9 \). Therefore, \( k + m = 5 + 9 = 14 \).
