Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electrons and positrons annihilating into photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, let's read the question again. An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are upper-right and lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Wait, Lore

---------------

ntz factors. The Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But I

---------------

'm not sure if I'll need the actual velocities here. Since we're dealing with relativistic particles, maybe their energies and momenta are important.

Electron and positron. Both

---------------

 have the same mass, right? The electron's mass is m, so the positron is also mass m. But their

---------------

 directions are opposite. The electron is moving to the right (from left), and the positron to the left (from right). So their momenta are in opposite directions.

Wait

---------------

, no. Wait, the problem says the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left. So the electron's direction is to the right. The positron is moving along the same axis but from the right, which would be to the left. So their velocities are opposite in direction.

When

---------------

 they collide, they annihilate into two photons. The photons have the same energy and move in upper-right and lower-right directions. So the

---------------

 angle between them is the angle between the two photon directions.

Hmm. So in the center-of-momentum frame, perhaps? Because when two particles annihilate, the photons are

---------------

 usually emitted in opposite directions to conserve momentum. But wait, in this case, the initial particles have different momenta, so the system's center of momentum isn't at rest.

Wait, no

---------------

. Because the electron and positron are moving in opposite directions, but with different speeds (different Lorentz factors). So their momenta are

---------------

 not equal and opposite. Let me think about that.

Let's calculate their momenta. The momentum p is gamma * m * v. But since they

---------------

're moving in opposite directions, their momenta will add vectorially.

Wait, the electron is moving to the right, so its momentum is positive. The positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative. So

---------------

 the total initial momentum is p_electron + p_positron.

But wait, their velocities are in opposite directions, so let

---------------

 me get the signs right. Let's set the direction to the right as positive. The electron's velocity is positive, positron's velocity is negative.

But wait

---------------

, Lorentz factor gamma is a scalar, so the same for both. The electron's momentum is gamma_e * m * v_e. The positron's momentum is gamma_p * m * v_p, but since it's moving in the opposite direction, the

---------------

 velocity is negative. So the positron's momentum is gamma_p * m * (-v_p). So the total initial momentum is (gamma_e * v_e - gamma_p * v_p) * m.

But I don't know the velocities yet. Alternatively

---------------

, maybe I can express the velocities in terms of gamma.

Wait, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me solve

---------------

 for v.

v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Hmm, but maybe I can avoid calculating

---------------

 v directly. Alternatively, I can think in terms of their energies.

The total energy of each particle is gamma * m * c². So the electron's energy is E_e = gamma_e * m c², and the positron's energy is E_p = gamma_p * m c².

Since

---------------

 the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative. So the total momentum before collision is (gamma_e v_e - gamma_p v_p) m.

Wait, but wait

---------------

, the momentum is gamma m v. So for the electron, it's gamma_e m v_e, and for the positron, gamma_p m v_p. But since the positron is moving left, v_p is negative, so the momentum is gamma_p m (-v_p). So the total momentum P_total is gamma_e m v_e - gamma_p m v_p.

Wait, but I

---------------

 don't have v_e and v_p. Alternatively, perhaps I can express v in terms of gamma.

Because gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

So for the electron, v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/4²) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = c * (sqrt(15)/4) ≈ 0.968 c.

Similarly, the positron's v_p is c * sqrt(1 - 1/(2^2)) = c * sqrt(3/4) = (c * sqrt(3))/2 ≈ 0.866 c.

But since the positron is moving left, v_p is negative, so v_p = -0.866 c.

So the

---------------

 electron's momentum is gamma_e m v_e = 4 m (0.968 c) = 3.873 m c.

The positron's momentum is gamma_p m v_p = 2 m (-0.866 c) = -1.732 m c.

So the total momentum before collision is 3.873 m c - 1.732 m c = 2.141 m c.

Wait, so

---------------

 the total initial momentum is positive, meaning in the right direction.

Now, after annihilation, two photons are produced. Both

---------------

 have the same energy, E_photon.

Each photon's momentum is E_photon / c, and the direction is either

---------------

 upper-right or lower-right. So their momenta vectors are in the first and fourth quadrants, respectively.

Let me represent the photons' momenta as vectors. Let's denote the direction

---------------

 of each photon by an angle θ from the horizontal (x-axis). The first photon is in the upper-right, so θ1 is above the x-axis. The second is in the lower-right, θ2 below.

But wait, the photons are emitted in opposite directions?

---------------

 Because in annihilation, conservation of momentum usually requires that. But here, the problem states that one is upper-right, another lower-right, but same energy. So their momenta would be in

---------------

 the first and fourth quadrants, but their angles might not be symmetric.

Wait, but their energies are the same, so the magnitudes of their momenta are the same (since |p| = E/c). So each photon has momentum p_photon = E_photon / c, same

---------------

 magnitude.

So the total momentum after annihilation is the vector sum of the two photons' momenta. This must equal the initial total momentum, which was 2.141 m c (right

---------------

 direction).

So let me set up the vector equations.

Let me denote the photons' momenta as vectors. Photon 1 has components (p, 0) + (p sin θ1, p cos θ1). Wait, no, perhaps

---------------

 I should use unit vectors.

Wait, the momenta of the photons are vectors. Since each photon's momentum is E/c in their

---------------

 direction, which is determined by their angles.

But perhaps it's easier to work in terms of angles. Let me define θ as the angle each photon makes with the x-axis. So

---------------

 for the first photon, moving upper-right, θ is positive (say, θ1). The second photon moves lower-right, so its angle is θ2, which is negative (

---------------

or perhaps 360 - θ if it's in the lower right; but in terms of vectors, it would be in

---------------

 the fourth quadrant, so θ2 is negative).

Wait, but in the problem statement, one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So both

---------------

 are in the right half-plane, but one above, one below the x-axis.

So let me model their momenta:

Photon 1: p1 = (E_photon/c) (cos θ, sin θ)
Photon 2: p2 = (E_photon/c) (cos(-θ), sin(-θ)) =

---------------

 (E_photon/c) (cos θ, -sin θ)

Wait, but the problem says the energies are same, but their

---------------

 directions are upper-right and lower-right. So maybe the angles are symmetric about the x-axis. So perhaps θ1 = θ, θ2 = -θ. But

---------------

 wait, no. Because if they are symmetric, their y-components would cancel each other, but their x-components would add. But in

---------------

 this case, the initial momentum is along the x-axis, so the x-component of the total photon momentum must equal the initial momentum.

Wait, let me think. The initial momentum is along

---------------

 the x-axis. So the sum of the photons' momenta must also be along the x-axis. So the y-components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other out.

If

---------------

 that's the case, then for photon 1 and 2, their y-components must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So,

---------------

 for example, photon 1 has a y-component of +p, photon 2 has -p. So their angles would be θ and -θ.

Wait

---------------

, but in that case, the sum of their y-components is zero. So the total momentum would be along the x-axis. Which makes sense, because the initial momentum is along the x-axis.

So if

---------------

 the photons are at angles θ and -θ, then their momenta are symmetric about the x-axis. So their y

---------------

-components cancel, and their x-components add.

So the total momentum after annihilation is the sum of their momenta:

p_total = (p1_x + p2_x, p1_y + p2_y) = (p1_x + p2_x, 0)

Which equals (2 p cos θ, 0) because

---------------

 p1_x = p cos θ and p2_x = p cos θ (since cos is even).

Wait, but wait

---------------

. Photon 1 has p1_x = E_photon/c * cos θ, and photon 2 has p2_x = E_photon/c * cos(-θ) = E_photon/c * cos θ. So their

---------------

 x-components add up to 2 (E_photon/c) cos θ.

The initial total momentum before annihilation was 2.141 m c (right

---------------

 direction). So this must equal the sum of the photons' x-components.

So:

2 (E_photon/c) cos θ = 2.141 m c

But

---------------

 wait, the sum of the photons' momenta must equal the initial momentum. So,

Total momentum after = sum of photons' momenta.

Which is:



---------------

p_photon1 + p_photon2 = (2 E_photon/c cos θ) in x-direction, and 0 in y.

So,



---------------

2 E_photon/(c) cos θ = initial_p (which is 2.141 m c).

So,

E_photon = (initial_p * c) / (2 cos θ)

But I

---------------

 don't know E_photon yet. Hmm.

Wait, but what about energy conservation? The total energy before must equal the total energy after.

The total energy before is the sum of the electron's and positron's energies.

Electron's energy is E_e = gamma_e * m c² = 4 m c².

Positron's energy is E_p = gamma_p * m c² = 2 m c².

So total energy before is 6 m c².

After annihilation, the total energy is the sum of the two photons' energies: 2 E_photon.

So,

2 E_photon = 6 m c² → E_photon = 3 m c².

So E

---------------

_photon is 3 m c².

Now, going back to the momentum equation.

2 E_photon/(c) cos θ = initial_p

Which

---------------

 is,

2*(3 m c²)/(c) * cos θ = 2.141 m c

Simplify:

(6 m c) cos θ = 2.141 m c

Divide both sides by m c:

6 cos θ = 2.141 → cos θ = 2.141 /6 ≈ 0.3568.

So θ ≈ arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69 degrees.

Wait, that

---------------

 can't be right. Wait, if each photon is at 69 degrees from the x-axis, but one is above and the other is below, then the angle between the two photons would be 2θ,

---------------

 which is 138 degrees. Because each is θ above and below the x-axis.

Wait, because the angle between the two photons would be θ1 - θ2. Since θ1 is 69 degrees above, θ2 is 69 degrees below, the angle between them is 69 + 69 = 138 degrees.

So the angle between the two photons is 138 degrees. Looking at the options, option C is 138.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Wait

---------------

, let's recalculate the initial momentum.

Electron's gamma is 4. Its velocity is v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (sqrt(15)/4) c ≈ 0.9682 c.

Momentum of electron, p_e = gamma_e * m * v_e = 4 * m * (sqrt(15)/4) c = m * sqrt(15) c ≈ 3.87298 m c.

Positron's gamma is 2. Its velocity is v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) c = (sqrt(3)/2) c ≈ 0.8660 c.

But since it's moving to the left, its momentum is negative: p_p = gamma_p * m * v_p * (-1) = 2 * m * (sqrt(3)/2) c * (-1) = - sqrt(3) m c ≈ -1.732 m c.

So total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e + p_p = 3.87298 m c - 1.732 m c ≈ 2.14098 m c.

So that

---------------

's correct.

Then, energy before annihilation is E_initial = 4 m c² + 2 m c² = 6 m c².

After annihilation, two

---------------

 photons each with E_photon = 3 m c².

So each photon's momentum magnitude is E_photon / c = 3 m c.

Now

---------------

, the photons' momenta vectors must sum to the initial momentum, which is 2.14098 m c in x-direction.

So

---------------

, each photon's x-component is (3 m c) cos θ. Two photons: 2 * 3 m c cos θ = 6 m c cos θ.

Set that equal to initial momentum:

6 m c cos θ = 2.14098 m c → cos θ = 2.14098/(6) ≈ 0.3568.

So θ ≈ arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69 degrees.

So each photon is at 69 degrees above and below the x-axis, making the angle between them 138 degrees. So the correct answer is C) 138.


To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation of the electron and positron, focusing on energy and momentum conservation principles.

### Step 1: Initial Momentum and Energy
- **Electron**: Moving to the right with a Lorentz factor $\gamma_e = 4$. Its velocity is $v_e = c \sqrt{1 - 1/4^2} = c \sqrt{15/16} = (\sqrt{15}/4)c \approx 0.968c$. Its momentum is $p_e = \gamma_e m v_e = 4m (\sqrt{15}/4)c = m\sqrt{15}c \approx 3.873mc$.
- **Positron**: Moving to the left with a Lorentz factor $\gamma_p = 2$. Its velocity is $v_p = c \sqrt{1 - 1/2^2} = c \sqrt{3/4} = (\sqrt{3}/2)c \approx 0.866c$. Its momentum is $p_p = \gamma_p m v_p = 2m (\sqrt{3}/2)c = \sqrt{3}mc \approx 1.732mc$, but since it is moving left, its momentum is $-1.732mc$.

The total initial momentum is:
\[
p_{\text{initial}} = p_e + p_p = 3.873mc - 1.732mc = 2.141mc.
\]

The total initial energy is:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_e mc^2 + \gamma_p mc^2 = 4mc^2 + 2mc^2 = 6mc^2.
\]

### Step 2: Energy and Momentum After Annihilation
After annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energies $E_{\text{photon}}$. Since the total energy is conserved:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = 2E_{\text{photon}} \implies E_{\text{photon}} = 3mc^2.
\]

Each photon's momentum magnitude is:
\[
p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = \frac{3mc^2}{c} = 3mc.
\]

### Step 3: Momentum Conservation
The photons are emitted symmetrically about the x-axis, one in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right direction. Let $\theta$ be the angle each photon makes with the x-axis. The x-components of their momenta add, while the y-components cancel due to symmetry.

The total momentum after annihilation is:
\[
p_{\text{total}} = 2p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta = 2(3mc)\cos\theta = 6mc\cos\theta.
\]

This must equal the initial momentum:
\[
6mc\cos\theta = 2.141mc \implies \cos\theta = \frac{2.141}{6} \approx 0.3568.
\]

Thus:
\[
\theta \approx \arccos(0.3568) \approx 69^\circ.
\]

### Step 4: Angle Between the Photons
Since one photon is at $+69^\circ$ and the other at $-69^\circ$, the angle between them is:
\[
\Delta\theta = 69^\circ + 69^\circ = 138^\circ.
\]

### Final Answer
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
