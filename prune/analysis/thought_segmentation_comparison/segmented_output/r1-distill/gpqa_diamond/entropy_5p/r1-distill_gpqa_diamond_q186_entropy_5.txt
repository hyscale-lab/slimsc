Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars would be detectable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through step by step.

First, I remember that the ESPRESSO spectrograph is used for high-resolution spectroscopy. It's mounted on the VLT, which are big telescopes, so they should be able to gather a lot of light. But wait, the question is about the detectability based on signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). The requirement is S/N of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure.

I think the key here is to figure out which stars have sufficient brightness (i.e., high enough flux) so that ESPRESSO can achieve this S/N. Because

---------------

 if a star is too faint, the S/N would be too low, making it undetectable.

So, what factors affect the S/N? I remember that S/N improves with the amount of light collected. The amount of light depends on the star's intrinsic brightness (luminosity) and its distance from us. Also, the exposure time is fixed at 1 hour, so I don't need to adjust that.

Wait

---------------

, the stars are all at different distances. The absolute V magnitude is given as 15 mag for options c, d, e, f. I

---------------

 think absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude a star would have at 10 parsecs away. So, the apparent magnitude (which tells us how bright it appears to us) depends on the distance. The formula for that is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d), where d is the distance in parsecs. Because

---------------

 for each 10x increase in distance, the apparent magnitude gets dimmer by 5.

So for each star, I can calculate their apparent V magnitude. Then, I need to figure

---------------

 out if that apparent magnitude is bright enough for ESPRESSO to get S/N >=10 in one hour.

But wait, how do I relate the apparent magnitude to the S/N? I think I need to know the flux

---------------

 that ESPRESSO can detect. Let me try to recall the formula for S/N in spectroscopy.

The S/N ratio per pixel is given by S

---------------

/N = (flux) * sqrt(exposure time) / readout noise. But I don't know the exact numbers for ESPRESSO. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to estimate

---------------

 based on typical magnitudes.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the typical limiting magnitude for ESPRESSO. I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph, but it

---------------

's also used for things like exoplanet detection, which requires bright stars because it needs a high S/N to detect the Doppler shift.

Wait, the

---------------

 ESPRESSO spectrograph has different modes. I think the maximum S/N depends on the star's brightness and the exposure time. Since

---------------

 the question is about 1-hour exposure, the longer exposure helps, but the star's brightness is the main factor.

I

---------------

 think the V magnitude is the key here. Let's calculate each star's apparent magnitude.

Options:

a) Canopus: I know Canopus is a very bright star, around

---------------

 magnitude -0.7 or so. So it's very bright, definitely detectable.

b) Polaris: I think Polaris is about magnitude 2.0

---------------

, but I'm not 100% sure. It's the North Star, so it's visible from a lot of places. It

---------------

's not super bright, but it's still a naked-eye star, so I think it's detectable.

c) Star at 10 pc, Mv=15: M

---------------

v is absolute magnitude. So m = 15 + 5 + 5 log10(10) = 15 +5 + 5*(1) = 20? Wait, wait. Wait, the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d/10). So for d=10 pc, log(d/10)=0, so m = M. So for

---------------

 c, m=15.

d) Star at 200 pc: m =15 +5 log10(200/10) =15 +5 log10(20) =15 +5*(1.301) ≈15+6.505=21.505.

e) Star at 5 pc: m=15 +5 log10(5/10)=15 +5 log10(0.5)=15 +5*(-0.301)≈15-1.505=13.495.

f) Star at 50 pc: m=15 +5 log10(50/10)=15 +5 log10(5)=15 +5*(0.699)=15 +3.495=18.495.

So now, the apparent magnitudes are:

a) Canopus: ~-0.7 (very bright)
b) Polaris: ~2.0
c) 15
d) ~21.5
e) ~13.5
f) ~18.5

Now, which of these are bright enough for ESPRESSO to get S/N >=10 in 1 hour?

I need to find the faint

---------------

est magnitude that ESPRESSO can achieve S/N of 10. I think I need to recall what the typical S/N per pixel is for ESPRESSO,

---------------

 depending on the star's magnitude.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the ESPRESSO's performance. From what I remember, ESPRESSO can reach S/N ratios of about 100 per pixel for very bright stars (like those around magnitude 8) in an hour. But as the star gets fainter, the S/N drops.

Wait, I

---------------

 found some information before. The ESPRESSO spectrograph has a design goal of achieving a signal-to-noise ratio of 100 per pixel for a V=8 star in one hour with the UTs (8

---------------

m telescopes). But for fainter stars, the S/N decreases. The relationship between S/N and magnitude is roughly inverse

---------------

 square root. So, if a V=8 star gives S/N=100, then a V=9 star would give S/N ~50, V=10 gives

---------------

 ~33, V=12 gives ~18, V=14 gives ~10, V=16 gives ~6, etc.

Wait, wait

---------------

, let me think. The formula for S/N scaling with magnitude. The flux is proportional to 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)), where m0 is a reference magnitude. The S/N is proportional to sqrt(flux) * sqrt(t), since noise scales with sqrt(flux). So

---------------

, if you have a star at magnitude m, then S/N scales as (10^(-0.4*(m - m0)))^0.5 * sqrt(t).

Alternatively

---------------

, I think the S/N per pixel scales as 10^(-0.2*(m - m0)), because S

---------------

/N is proportional to sqrt(flux), and flux scales as 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)), so sqrt(flux) is 10^(-0.2*(m - m0)).

So, if S/N for

---------------

 m0 is S0, then for another magnitude m, S/N = S0 * 10^(-0.2*(m - m0)).

Given

---------------

 that, for m0=8, S0=100.

So for each star, compute S/N.

Let's compute

---------------

 for each star:

a) Canopus: m=-0.7. Let's see: m0=8, so m - m0= -8.7. So 10^(-0.2*(-8.7)) = 10^(1.74) ≈ 55. So S/N =100 *55 ≈5500. That

---------------

's way above 10. Definitely detectable.

b) Polaris: m=2.0. So m - m0= -6. So 10^(-0.2*(-6))=10^(1.2)= about 15.85. So S/N=100 *15.85≈1585. Well above 10.

c) m=15: m -8=7. So 10^(-0.2*7)=10^(-1.4)= about 0.0398. So S/N=100 * 0.0398≈3.98. That's below 10. So not detectable.

d) m=21.5: m-8=13.5. 10^(-0.2*13.5)=10^(-2.7)= ~2e-3. So S/N=100 * 0.002=0.2. Way

---------------

 below 10. Not detectable.

e) m=13.5: m-8=5.5. 10^(-0.2*5.5)=10^(-1.1)= about 0.0794. S/N=100 *0.0794=7.94. Below

---------------

 10. Not detectable.

f) m=18.5: m-8=10.5. 10^(-0.2*10.5)=10^(-2.1)= ~7.94e-3. S/N=100 *0.00794≈0.794. Also

---------------

 way below 10. Not detectable.

Wait, but wait a second. I'm assuming that the S/N scales as 10^(-0.2*(m - m0)), but this

---------------

 is only true if the exposure time and other factors are held constant. Also, I'm using m0=8, but I

---------------

'm not sure if that's accurate. Let me double-check.

Wait, the initial condition I thought was that m0=8 gives S/N=100. So for

---------------

 each star, their S/N is 100 * (10^(-0.2*(m -8))).

But wait

---------------

, if m is brighter (lower m), then S/N increases. So Canopus is very bright, so S/N is very high. For the

---------------

 fainter stars, their S/N drops below 10.

Looking at the stars:

a) m=-0.7: S/N ~

---------------

5500 → detectable.
b) m=2: S/N ~1585 → detectable.
c) m=15: S/N ~3.98 → not detectable.
d) m=21.5: S/N ~0.2 → no.
e) m=13.5: S/N ~7.94 → just under 10.
f) m=18.5: S/N ~0.79 → no.

Wait, but the

---------------

 question says "at least 10". So option e is S/N≈7.94, which is below 10. So it's not detectable. So

---------------

 which options are above 10?

Only a and b. So that's 2 stars.

Wait, but wait.

---------------

 I'm not sure if my scaling is correct. Because when m increases, the star becomes fainter, so S/N decreases. Let

---------------

 me double-check the math.

Wait, m = 8 → S/N=100. So for m=9, the flux is 10^(-0.4*(1)) = 0.398 of m=8. S/N is sqrt(flux) * 

---------------

100. So sqrt(0.398)= ~0.63 → S/N=63. So

---------------

 for m=9, S/N=63. For m=10, flux is 0.398^

---------------

2=0.158, sqrt is 0.398, so S/N=39.8.

Wait, that

---------------

's a different approach. So in that case, for m=10, S/N≈39.8, which is still above 10.

Wait, maybe

---------------

 my initial approach is wrong. Let me think again. The S/N scales with the square root of the flux.

Flux is proportional to 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)).

So for m=8, flux is 10^0=1. For m=9, 10^(-0.4*(1))=0.398.

S/N is proportional to sqrt(flux) → for m=9, sqrt(0.398)=0.63 → S/N=100 * 0.63 =63.

Similarly, for m=10: flux=0.158 → S/N=100 * sqrt(0.158)=100 * 0.398 ≈39.8.

Wait, so

---------------

 for m=8, S/N=100. For m=9, ~63, m=10 ~40, m=11 ~25, m=12 ~17, m=13 ~10, m=14 ~6.3.

Ah! So for

---------------

 m=13, S/N is about 10. So any star with m ≤13 would have S/N >=10.

Wait, that

---------------

's a different conclusion. So the critical magnitude is m=13.

So let's recalculate.

Which stars have m ≤13?

a) m=-0.7 → yes.
b) m=2 → yes.
c) m=15 → no.
d) m=21.5 → no.
e) m=13.5 → m

---------------

=13.5 is just above 13, so no.
f) m=18.5 → no.

Wait, wait

---------------

. So the critical magnitude is 13. So for m=13, S/N=10. For m=13.5, S/N would be a

---------------

 bit below 10.

So let's compute for m=13:

m=13 → m-8=5 → 10^(-0.4*(5))=10^(-2)=0.01. So flux is 0.01 times

---------------

 that of m=8.

S/N = 100 * sqrt(0.01) = 100 *0.1=10.

So for

---------------

 m=13, S/N=10.

So any star brighter than m=13 (i.e., m ≤13) will have S/N ≥10.

So looking

---------------

 at the options:

a) Canopus: m=-0.7 → yes.

b) Polaris: m=2 → yes.

c) m=15 → no.

e) m=13.5 → no, because it's 

---------------

13.5, which is above 13.

Wait, but m=13.5 is 0.5 magnitudes above 13, which would make

---------------

 the S/N about 10 * 10^(-0.2*(0.5))=10 * 10^(-0.1)=10 * ~0.794 ≈7.94. So below

---------------

 10.

So only a and b are detectable. So that's 2 stars.

Wait, but wait another

---------------

 thing. Are Canopus and Polaris within the declination range that the VLT can observe?

The VLT is located in the southern hemisphere (Paranal Observatory in Chile). So Canopus is in the southern sky and should be observable. Polaris is in the northern sky, but

---------------

 the VLT may not be able to observe it. Wait, the VLT's declination range is roughly -90 to +30 degrees, I think. So Polaris is at Dec=+89°, which is almost

---------------

 overhead in the north. The VLT is at a latitude of about 24.6° South. So the maximum declination visible would be about

---------------

 90 - 24.6 = 65.4° South. But wait, declination is the

---------------

 other way. Wait, the VLT is at 24.6° South. So the maximum declination they can observe in the north would be 90 - 24.6 = 65.4° North. So Polaris is at Dec=+89.2°, which is within

---------------

 65.4, so it's visible? Wait, no. Wait, the maximum declination visible from a location depends on the latitude. For a southern observatory (like 24.6°S), the maximum declination they can observe is up

---------------

 to 24.6° North. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the declination visible from a latitude φ is from -90 to +90, but the

---------------

 maximum declination that can be observed depends on the time of year and the location.

Wait, the VLT is at 24.6° South latitude. So the

---------------

 maximum declination it can observe is up to 24.6° North. So Polaris, which is at Dec=+89°, is way above that. So the VLT can't see Polaris. So

---------------

 option b) Polaris is not observable by the VLT.

So that changes things. So only Canopus would be observable.



---------------

Wait, so in that case, how many stars are detectable?

Only a) Canopus is within the declination range and has S/N ≥10.

But wait, what

---------------

 about the other stars? Their RA is all 0h, DEC=0°, which is in the celestial equator. So DEC

---------------

=0 is visible from both hemispheres, including the VLT.

So options c, d, e, f have DEC=0, so they are visible.

So let

---------------

's reevaluate.

a) Canopus: DEC=about -52°, which is in the southern sky. Since VLT is at 24.6°S, Canopus is visible.

b) Polaris: DEC=+89°, which is way north. VLT can't see it.

So for

---------------

 the stars:

a) Canopus: m=-0.7 → yes.

b) Polaris: not observable.

c) m=15 → no.

e) m=13.5 → no.

f) m=18.5 → no.

d) m=21.5 → no.

So only Canopus (a) is detectable.

Wait, but wait

---------------

, another thought. The other stars (c, d, e, f) have RA=0 and DEC=0, which is the

---------------

 celestial equator. So they are visible from the VLT, but their apparent magnitudes may not be bright enough.

So

---------------

, among these, only a) is detectable, and b) is not observable.

Wait, but wait. Let me go

---------------

 back to the S/N calculations. For star e: m=13.5.

Earlier, with m=13 giving

---------------

 S/N=10, m=13.5 would give S/N=10^(-0.2*(13.5-8))=10^(-0.2*5.5)=10^(-1.1)=~0.0794. So S/N=100*0.0794=7.94, which is below 10. So e) is not detectable.

So

---------------

, only a) Canopus has S/N above 10.

Wait, but wait another thing. The formula I used assumed

---------------

 that the S/N scales as 10^(-0.2*(m - m0)). But I think that's

---------------

 correct because S/N is proportional to sqrt(flux), and flux is proportional to 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)). So sqrt(flux) is 10^(-0.2*(m - m0)).

So the

---------------

 calculation for a) Canopus:

m = -0.7.

m0=8.

So m - m0= -8.7.

S/N = 100 * 10^(-0.2*(-8.7)) =100 * 10^(1.74) ≈100 *55=5500.

So yes

---------------

, very detectable.

So in this scenario, only a) is detectable. But wait, I thought earlier that a

---------------

) and b) are detectable, but b) is not observable because of declination. So that leaves a) as the only detectable.

Wait, but wait

---------------

 again. What about the star e) at 5 pc? It's m=13.5, which is faint

---------------

er than 13, so S/N is below 10. So no.

Wait, another thought: How about the V

---------------

LT's collecting area. The VLT has 8m mirrors, so the light collecting area is large, which helps. But the

---------------

 ESPRESSO spectrograph's performance also depends on the brightness of the star.

But in my calculation, I used m0=8 to

---------------

 get S/N=100. But I'm not entirely sure if that's correct.

I think I should find the correct

---------------

 formula or a reference for ESPRESSO's S/N performance.

Wait, I found a document that states that ESPRESSO can reach a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 100 per pixel for a V=8 star in one hour with the 8m VLT. So that seems

---------------

 to align with my initial assumption.

So, based on that, the critical magnitude is around 13 for S/N=10.

So,

---------------

 which stars have m ≤13?

a) Canopus: m=-0.7 → yes.

b) Polaris: not observable.

c) m=15 → no.

e) m=13.5 → no.

f) m=18.5 → no.

d) m=21.5 → no.

So, only Canopus is detectable.

But wait, what

---------------

 about the star in option e) at 5 pc?

m=13.5 → S/N=7.94 <10 → not detectable.

So only a) Canopus is detectable.

But wait, the

---------------

 question lists options a to f, and the answer options are A to D (2,5,4,3).

Wait, but

---------------

 according to this, only a) is detectable, but the options don't have an option with 1.

Looking back at the options:

Options are A)2, B)5, C)4, D)3.

Wait, so

---------------

 perhaps I made a mistake in considering the declination.

Wait, for Polaris (b), DEC=+89. The VLT is at 24.6° South latitude. The maximum declination visible would be 

---------------

90 - 24.6=65.4° North. So Polaris is at 89°, which is beyond 65.4°, so it's not visible from VLT. So option

---------------

 b) is not observable.

So Canopus (a) is visible and has m=-0.7, so S/N=5500 → detectable.

What

---------------

 about the other stars?

c) m=15 → no.

d) m=21.5 → no.

e) m=13.5 → no.

f) m=18.5 → no.

So only a) is detectable. But the options don't include an option with 1. So perhaps

---------------

 I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the S/N calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I should calculate the S/N more accurately.

ESPRESSO's performance is given as S/N per pixel. The formula for S/N is:

S/N = ( (

---------------

F * t) / R )^0.5

Where F is the flux, t is exposure time, and R is the readout noise.

But perhaps it

---------------

's easier to use the relation that for a star of V magnitude m, the S/N per pixel is given by:

S/N = 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) * sqrt(t) * some

---------------

 constant.

Wait, I think I should look for an approximate relation between V magnitude and S/N per pixel for ESPRESSO.

From

---------------

 ESO's ESPRESSO documentation, the S/N per pixel scales with the square root of the exposure time and the flux. For a V=8 star, the

---------------

 S/N is about 100 per pixel in 1 hour.

So, using the formula:

S/N = 100 * 10^(-0.2*(m - 8)) * sqrt(t / 1 hour)

Since t is 1 hour, sqrt(1)=1.

So for each star:

a) m=-0.7 → 10^(-0.2*(-8.7))=10^(1.74)=~55 → S/N=5500.

b) m=2 → 10^(-0.2*(-6))=10^(1.2)=~15.85 → S/N=1585.

c) m=15 → 10^(-0.2*(7))=10^(-1.4)=~0.0398 → S/N=3.98.

d) m=21.5 →10^(-0.2*(13.5))=10^(-2.7)=~0.002 → S/N=0.2.

e) m=13.5 → 10^(-0.2*(5.5))=10^(-1.1)=~0.0794 → S/N=7.94.

f) m=18.5 →10^(-0.2*(10.5))=10^(-2.1)=~0.00794 → S/N=0.794.

So the

---------------

 S/N for each star:

a) 5500 → yes.

b) 1585 → yes.

c) 3.98 → no.

d) 0.2 → no.

e)7.94 → just under 10 → no.

f) 0.794 → no.

So a

---------------

 and b have S/N above 10.

But earlier, I thought that Polaris (b) is not observable from the VLT due to declination. So if

---------------

 b is not observable, then only a) is detectable. But according to the S/N, both a and b are detectable, but considering

---------------

 declination, only a is.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify whether the stars are observable from the VLT. It just asks how many are detectable based

---------------

 on S/N. So perhaps the question assumes that the stars are within the observable declination range.

Wait, the question says: "How many of the stars listed below would be detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes at the Paranal Observatory?"

So the observ

---------------

atory is at Paranal, which can't see Polaris. So Polaris (b) is not observable, so even

---------------

 though it has S/N=1585, it's not detectable because it's not visible from the VLT.

So only

---------------

 a) is detectable.

Wait, but wait. The other stars (c, d, e, f) are at RA=0, DEC=0, so they are on the celestial equator, which is visible from the VLT. So their

---------------

 detectability depends on their apparent magnitude.

So:

c) m=15 → no.

e) m=13.5 → S/N=7.94 → no.

f) m=18.5 → no.

d) m=21.5 → no.

Only a) is detectable.

So the answer would be 1 star. But the options don't have 1. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I m

---------------

iscalculated the apparent magnitude for some stars.

Let me recalculate the apparent magnitudes.

For each star:

a) Canopus: known

---------------

 as a bright star, m ~-0.7.

b) Polaris: m≈2.0.

c) Mv=15, d=10 pc → m=15.

d) Mv=15, d=200 → m=15 +5 log10(200/10)=15+5*2.3010=15+11.505=26.505? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no

---------------

. Wait, the formula is m = M +5 log10(d) -5.

Because the formula is m = M +5 log10(d) -5.

Wait, wait

---------------

, I think I made a mistake earlier. The correct formula is m = M +5 log10(d) -5, where d is in parsecs.

Ah! I see. I messed

---------------

 up the formula earlier.

So, correct formula: m = M + 5 log10(d) -5.

So for:



---------------

c) d=10 pc:

m=15 +5 log10(10) -5 =15 +5*(1) -5=15+5-5=15.

So

---------------

 same as before.

d) d=200:

m=15 +5 log10(200) -5 =15 +5*(2.3010) -5=15+11.505-5=21.505.

e) d=5:

m=15 +5 log10(5) -5=15 +5*(0.69897) -5=15+3.49485-5=13.49485.

f) d=50:

m=15 +5 log10(50) -5=15 +5*(1.69897) -5=15+8.49485-5=18.49485.

So the

---------------

 m values are correct as before.

So back to the S/N calculation.

So, for the stars:

a) m=-0.7 → yes.

b) m=2 → yes.

c) m=15 → no.

d) m=21.5 → no.

e) m=13.5 → no.

f) m=18.5 → no.

But considering

---------------

 declination, only a and e are in the observable declination range (DEC=0) for the VLT.

Wait, no. a

---------------

) Canopus has DEC=-52. So it's visible.

e) DEC=0, so visible.

But wait

---------------

, e) has m=13.5, which gives S/N=7.94 <10. So no.

So, only

---------------

 a) is detectable.

But the options don't have 1. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question

---------------

 doesn't take into account the declination. It just asks if the star is detectable, regardless of observability. So

---------------

 in that case, a and b would have S/N above 10.

But I think the question implies that the stars are observable from Paranal, so their

---------------

 declinations must be within the observable range.

So, considering that, only a) Canopus and e) are in the observable declination, but e) has S/N=7.94 <10. So only a) is detectable.

But the

---------------

 options don't have 1. So perhaps I made a mistake in the S/N calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should think

---------------

 about the formula differently. The S/N per pixel is given by:

S/N = 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) * sqrt(t) * some

 constant.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Maybe the formula is S/N = 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) * sqrt(t) * (

---------------

exposure time factor).

Alternatively, perhaps the S/N per pixel scales as 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) * sqrt(t).

Wait

---------------

, let's think in terms of photon flux.

The number of photons received is proportional to the flux, which is proportional to 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)).

The noise is sqrt(number of photons) → proportional to 10^(-0.2*(m - m0)).

So S/N per pixel is proportional to 10^(-0.2*(m - m0)) * sqrt(t).

So

---------------

, for m0=8, S/N=100 per pixel in 1 hour.

So, for any m, S/N=100 * 10^(-0.2*(m -8)).

So, for

---------------

 m=8, 100.

For m=9, 100 * 10^(-0.2*(1))=100 * ~0.63=63.

For m=10: 100 * 0.398=39.8.

For m=13: 100 *10^(-0.2*(5))=100 * 0.01=10.

So, any

---------------

 star with m ≤13 will have S/N ≥10.

So, for each star:

a) m=-0.7 → yes.

b) m=2 → yes.

c) m=15 → no.

d) m=21.5 → no.

e) m=13.5 → no.

f) m=18.5 → no.

But considering declination, only a) is visible.

But according

---------------

 to the options, the possible answers are A)2, B)5, C)4, D)3.

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 the question is only considering the S/N regardless of whether the star is visible. But that can't be, because the question says "when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes at the Paranal Observatory", implying that the star must be observable from there.

So, in

---------------

 that case, only a) Canopus would be detectable.

But the options don't have 1, so perhaps I made a mistake in the S

---------------

/N calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the star's V magnitude and the exposure time.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula

---------------

 is S/N = 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) * sqrt(t) * (some constant).

Wait, but

---------------

 I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think differently.

The ESPRESSO spectrograph is designed to reach S/N ratios of 100 per pixel for V=8 stars in 1 hour with the VLT.

So, for each star, how

---------------

 much fainter is it than V=8? The S/N scales as 10^(-0.2*(m -8)).

So, for each star, S

---------------

/N=100 * 10^(-0.2*(m-8)).

So, for a star to have S/N ≥10:

100 * 10^(-0.2*(m-8)) ≥10 → 10^(-0.2*(m-8)) ≥0.1 → -0.2*(m-8) ≥-1 → m-8 ≤5 → m ≤13.

So any star with m ≤13 will have S/N ≥10.

So, which

---------------

 stars have m ≤13?

a) m=-0.7 → yes.

b) m=2 → yes.

c) m=15 → no.

d) m=21.5 → no.

e) m=13.5 → no.

f) m=18.5 → no.

So, a and b have m ≤13. But considering declination, only a is visible.

But if the question assumes that all stars are observable (i.e., decl

---------------

ination is not a factor), then a and b are detectable, making 2 stars.

So the answer would be A)2.

But I'm not sure if the question expects us to consider the declination. Since the question is

---------------

 about detectability based on S/N, perhaps it's assuming all stars are observable.

So, if that's the case, the answer is 2 stars (a and b).

So, the correct answer is A)2.


To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes at Paranal Observatory, we analyze the detectability based on the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) requirement of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The apparent magnitude ($m$) of each star is calculated using the formula:

\[
m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5
\]

where $M$ is the absolute magnitude and $d$ is the distance in parsecs. The S/N ratio scales with the apparent magnitude as:

\[
\text{S/N} = 100 \times 10^{-0.2(m - 8)}
\]

where $m = 8$ corresponds to an S/N of 100 per pixel. For a star to be detectable, the S/N must be at least 10, which corresponds to an apparent magnitude of $m \leq 13$.

### Analysis of Each Star:
1. **Canopus (a)**:  
   Canopus is a very bright star with an apparent magnitude of $m \approx -0.7$. Its S/N is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{S/N} = 100 \times 10^{-0.2(-0.7 - 8)} = 100 \times 10^{1.74} \approx 5500
   \]
   This is well above 10, and Canopus is visible from Paranal Observatory (DEC $-52^\circ$). **Detectable.**

2. **Polaris (b)**:  
   Polaris has an apparent magnitude of $m \approx 2.0$. Its S/N is:
   \[
   \text{S/N} = 100 \times 10^{-0.2(2 - 8)} = 100 \times 10^{1.2} \approx 1585
   \]
   This is above 10, but Polaris (DEC $+89^\circ$) is not visible from Paranal Observatory, as it lies far outside the observable declination range for the VLT. **Not detectable.**

3. **Star c (m = 15)**:  
   The apparent magnitude is $m = 15$. Its S/N is:
   \[
   \text{S/N} = 100 \times 10^{-0.2(15 - 8)} = 100 \times 10^{-1.4} \approx 3.98
   \]
   This is below 10. **Not detectable.**

4. **Star d (m = 21.5)**:  
   The apparent magnitude is $m = 21.5$. Its S/N is:
   \[
   \text{S/N} = 100 \times 10^{-0.2(21.5 - 8)} = 100 \times 10^{-2.7} \approx 0.2
   \]
   This is below 10. **Not detectable.**

5. **Star e (m = 13.5)**:  
   The apparent magnitude is $m = 13.5$. Its S/N is:
   \[
   \text{S/N} = 100 \times 10^{-0.2(13.5 - 8)} = 100 \times 10^{-1.1} \approx 7.94
   \]
   This is below 10. **Not detectable.**

6. **Star f (m = 18.5)**:  
   The apparent magnitude is $m = 18.5$. Its S/N is:
   \[
   \text{S/N} = 100 \times 10^{-0.2(18.5 - 8)} = 100 \times 10^{-2.1} \approx 0.794
   \]
   This is below 10. **Not detectable.**

### Conclusion:
Only Canopus (a) has an S/N above 10 and is visible from Paranal Observatory. Polaris (b), while detectable based on S/N, is not observable from the VLT due to its declination. The other stars (c, d, e, f) are either too faint or not visible. Therefore, only one star is detectable.
