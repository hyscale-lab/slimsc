Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking at the gene sequences to find which mutation would eliminate the compound.

The intact gene and the mutants are given as DNA sequences. I think the key here is to look at the mutations in the exons because exons are the coding regions of the gene. Changes

---------------

 in exons, especially in the beginning where they are, might affect the protein product.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a change somewhere in the first exon. The

---------------

 anti-nutritional compound is likely a protein, so if the gene's product is a protein, a mutation that disrupts the gene's function would be desired.

I

---------------

 remember that to disrupt a gene's function, you can cause a frameshift or a premature stop codon. Frameshifts change the reading frame, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence from the mutation point onward. Alternatively, a nonsense mutation introduces a stop codon early, making a shorter, nonfunctional protein.

So, I need to check each mutant's sequence for either

---------------

 a frameshift or a stop codon.

Let's look at each mutant:

Intact gene sequence starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant 1:
ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

Comparing to intact, let's see where the changes are. Let me write the

---------------

 wild-type and mutant sequences.

Wild-type first part: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT

---------------

 ATT TAT TGT CGT...

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT ACG C TGG TAC TTCTGTGGAT... Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I should write the sequences line by line.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look for where the sequences differ.

In Mutant 1, the change

---------------

 is in the first part. Let me look at each triplet:

Wild-type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCTGTG GAT GAA ...

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the exact differences matter. Let me compare each nucleotide.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to see if the mutations cause a frameshift or a premature stop.

Frames

---------------

hift occurs when the reading frame is altered, which happens when the number of nucleotides changed isn't a multiple of three. So

---------------

, if a deletion or insertion is not in threes, it causes frameshift.

Looking at the mutants:

Mutant 1: Let's see the

---------------

 sequence. The first part of the wild-type is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant 1 is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

Compar

---------------

ing:

Wild-type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT ACG C TGG TAC TTCTGTG GAT GAA ...

Wait, perhaps I

---------------

 should look for the point where they differ.

Alternatively, perhaps I should count the number of nucleotides changed in each mutant.

But

---------------

 another approach: looking for in-frame changes that might cause a stop codon.

Looking at the wild-type, the start codon is ATG. Let

---------------

's see the first few codons:

Wild-type:
ATG (start)
TTT (Phe)
CTC (Leu)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATA (Ile)
TTT (Phe)
TGT (Cys)
CGT (Arg)
...

Mutant 1:
ATG (start)
TTT (Phe)
CTA (Leu)
CGC (Arg)
TGG (Trp)
TAC (Tyr)
TTCTGTG (Hmm, that

---------------

's a longer stretch; wait, perhaps I should write out the codons.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to see if any of the mutations introduce a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA) in the reading

---------------

 frame.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: Let's compare the wild-type and mutant 1 sequences.

Wild-type: positions 1-3

---------------

: ATG (start)
Positions 4-6: TTT
Positions 7-9: CTC
Positions 10-12: GCT
Positions 13-15: GGT
Positions 16-18: ACT
Positions 19-21: TCT
Positions 22-24: GTG
Positions 25-27: GAT
Positions 28-30: GAA
...

Mutant 1: Let

---------------

's see where the change is. Looking at the sequences:

Wild-type: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...
Mutant 1: ...CTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGC...

Wait, so the

---------------

 change is at position 7-9 perhaps? Let me line them up.

Wild-type: positions 7-9: CTC (Leu)
Mutant 1: positions 7-9: CTA (Leu)

---------------

 [Wait, is that correct? Because in the mutant, the sequence after ATGTTT is CTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGCG...

Wait, perhaps it's better to look

---------------

 for where the change occurs. The wild-type sequence at the beginning is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant 1 is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

So, looking

---------------

 at the first part, the wild-type has CTC (Leu) at positions 7-9, then GCT (Ala) at 10-12.

Mutant 1 has CTA (Leu) at 7-9, then CGC (Arg) at 10-12.

So, in mutant

---------------

 1, the codon at positions 10-12 changes from GCT (Ala) to CGC (Arg). That's an in-frame change, same reading frame, so no frameshift. So the protein would have Leu, then Arg instead of Ala.

No

---------------

 stop codon introduced. So the protein might still function, but with a different amino acid. So this probably doesn't eliminate the compound.

Mutant 2:

Sequence: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

Compar

---------------

ing to wild-type, let's see where it changes.

Wild-type: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...
Mutant 2: ...CTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGC...

Wait, so

---------------

 the wild-type after CTC is GCT, then GGT. Mutant 2 has CTA AGC TGG.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I should look for the exact differences. Let's see:

Wild-type: positions 7-9: CTC (Leu)
Positions 10-12: GCT (Ala)
Positions 13-15: GGT (Gly)
...

Mutant 2: positions 7-9: CTA (Leu)
Positions 10-12: AGC (Ser)
Positions 13-15: TGG (Trp)
...

So the change

---------------

 is in positions 10-12 from GCT to AGC, and position 13-15 from GGT to TGG.

So again

---------------

, same frame, no stop codon. So the protein is altered but still likely functional. So this probably doesn't eliminate the compound.

Mutant 3:

Sequence: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Looking for changes:

Wild-type after ATGTTT is CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...

Mutant 3 has TTCTACGCTGGTGTCACTTC...

Wait, perhaps the

---------------

 changes are in the middle. Let's see:

Wild-type: ...TTCTGTGG...

Mutant 3: ...TCACTTCTGTGC...

Wait, I think it's better to check

---------------

 the codon structure.

Wild-type: positions 7-9: CTC (Leu)
Positions 10-12: GCT (Ala)
Positions 13-15: GGT (Gly)
Positions 16-18: ACT (Thr)
Positions 19-21: TCT (Ser)
Positions 22-24: GTG (Val)
...

Mutant 3: positions 7-9: TTA (Leu)
Positions 10-12: CGC (Arg)
Positions 13-15: TGG (Trp)
Positions 16-18: GTC (Val)
Positions 19-21: ACT (Thr)
Positions 22-24: GCT (Ala)
...

Wait, I

---------------

'm a bit confused. Let me try to align the sequences.

Wild-type: ...TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant3: ...TTCTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 the changes are in positions 7-9 and 13-15.

Wait, maybe I should look for a frameshift or a stop codon.

Wait

---------------

, in mutant 3, the sequence after ATG is TTT (Phe), then TAC, which is Tyr. Wait

---------------

, but that's in the same frame.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mutation causes a frameshift. Let me count the nucleotides.

Looking

---------------

 at the wild-type and mutant 3, maybe a base is inserted or deleted.

Alternatively, perhaps a substitution that leads to a stop codon.

Wait, let

---------------

's look for any TGA in the reading frame. The wild-type has TGA at the end as the stop codon.

In mutant 3, the

---------------

 end is ...GTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

So, the stop codon is still present. But perhaps

---------------

 an earlier stop occurs.

Looking for TGA in the middle.

Looking at mutant 3's sequence: ...TTCTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Wait

---------------

, let's see each codon:

ATG (start)
TTT (Phe)
CTA (Leu)
CGC (Arg)
TGG (Trp)
TCA (Ser)
CTT (Leu)
CTG (Leu)
GGA (Gly)
TGA (stop)

Wait, no

---------------

, the stop codon is at the end, so the earlier codons are normal. So in mutant3, the 

---------------

5th codon after start is CGC (Arg), then TGG (Trp), etc. So no stop codon introduced.

---------------

 So this probably doesn't eliminate the compound.

Mutant4:

Sequence: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Comparing to wild-type:

Wild-type: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...

Mutant4: ...TACGCTACTTCTGTGG...

Wait, perhaps looking at the codons.

Wild-type:

ATG (start)
TTT (Phe)
CTC (Leu)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
...

Mutant4:

ATG (start)
TTT (Phe)
TTT (Phe) ??

---------------

 Wait, no, let me see.

Wait, the mutant4 sequence starts with ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGG...

So after ATG, it's TTTTACGCTACT...

Wait, wait

---------------

, let's write the nucleotides:

Wild-type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTT CTT GTG GAT GAA ...

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the mutant4 has a deletion or insertion that causes a frameshift. Because in

---------------

 the given sequences, the mutant4 sequence is shorter?

Wait, looking at the sequences:

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Comparing the two

---------------

, I see that in mutant4, the sequence after ATG is TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGG...

In

---------------

 the wild-type, it's TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...

So, the wild-type has CT

---------------

 CGC TGG TAC T... while mutant4 has TTACGCTAC TTCT...

Wait, perhaps the mutant

---------------

4 has a deletion or insertion.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of nucleotides changed is not a multiple of three, causing a frameshift.

Looking at the exact

---------------

 changes:

Wild-type after ATG is TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...

Mutant4 after ATG is TTCTACGCTACTTCTGTGG...

Wait, perhaps I

---------------

 should count the number of nucleotides.

Alternatively, perhaps the wild-type's first exon has a certain number of nucleotides, and mutant4's first

---------------

 exon has a different length.

Wait, perhaps the way the sequences are presented can help. For instance, the wild-type starts

---------------

 with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Mutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Looking at the initial

---------------

 part:

Wild-type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTT CTT GTG GAT GAA ...

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the change is that after TTT, instead of CTC, it's TTA, then CGC, then TAC, etc.

So, let

---------------

's see:

Wild-type:

Positions 1-3: ATG (start)
4-6: TTT (Phe)
7-9: CTC (Leu)
10-12: GCT (Ala)
13-15: GGT (Gly)
16-18: ACT (Thr)
19-21: TCT (Ser)
22-24: GTG (Val)
...

Mutant4:

1-3: ATG (start)
4-6: TTT (Phe)
7-9: TTA (Leu)
10-12: CGC (Arg)
13-15: TAC (Tyr)
16-18: TTT (Phe)
19-21: CTT (Leu)
22-24: GTG (Val)
...

So the codons are

---------------

:

ATG, TTT, TTA, CGC, TAC, TTT, CTT, GTG...

So from

---------------

 position 7-9, the wild-type has CTC (Leu), and mutant4 has TTA (Leu). Then,

---------------

 wild-type has GCT (Ala) at 10-12, mutant4 has CGC (Arg). Then wild-type has GGT (Gly) at 13-15, mutant4 has TAC (Tyr). So

---------------

, it's in frame, no frameshift. But looking for any stop codon.

Looking through the codons:

AT

---------------

G (start)
TTT (Phe)
TTA (Leu)
CGC (Arg)
TAC (Tyr)
TTT (Phe)
CTT (Leu)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATA (Ile)
TTT (Phe)
TGT (Cys)
CGT (Arg)
...
TGA (stop)

So no stop codon introduced in

---------------

 the middle. So the protein is longer but might be nonfunctional if a key amino acid is altered. But the question is about eliminating the anti-nutritional compound, which is

---------------

 likely caused by the protein product of this gene. So disrupting the gene would be best.

Wait, but none of the options seem

---------------

 to introduce a stop codon early. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check each mutant again for a stop codon.

Mut

---------------

ant 1:

Codons:

ATG, TTT, CTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), TGG (Trp), TAC (Tyr), TTT (Phe), CTT (Leu), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), ...

No TGA or TAG or TAA in

---------------

 the middle.

Mutant2:

ATG, TTT, CTA (Leu), AGC (Ser), TGG (Trp), TAC (Tyr), TTT (Phe), CTT (Leu), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), ...

No stop codon.

Mutant3:

ATG, TTT, TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), TGG (Trp), TCA (Ser), CTT (Leu), CTG (Leu), GGA (Gly), TGA (stop).

Oh wait! In mutant3, the codon after T

---------------

CA (Ser) is CTT (Leu), then CTG (Leu), then GGA (Gly), then TGA (stop). So the mutation introduced

---------------

 a stop codon at the position where the wild-type would have continued. So the protein would be shorter, possibly nonfunctional.

Wait, let

---------------

 me check the exact sequence. Let me see the mutant3's sequence:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So the first

---------------

 part after ATG is TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 it's better to write the codons:

ATG (start)
TTT (Phe)
TTT (Phe) ???

---------------

 Wait, no. Wait, the first part after ATG is TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, wait

---------------

, perhaps I'm getting the codons wrong. Let me write it as triplets:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

So each

---------------

 triplet:

ATG (start)
TTT (Phe)
TAC (Tyr)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
GTC (Val)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
...

Wait, that

---------------

's the wild-type? No, in mutant3, the sequence is:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Wait, no

---------------

, that's not the wild-type. The wild-type after ATG is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I'm getting confused because the way the sequences are written. Let me count each triplet.

Wild-type:

1-3: ATG
4-6: TTT
7-9: CTC
10-12: GCT
13-15: GGT
16-18: ACT
19-21: TCT
22-24: GTG
25-27: GAT
28-30: GAA
...

Mutant3:

1-3: ATG
4-6: TTT
7-9: TTA (Leu)
10-12: CGC (Arg)
13-15: TGG (Trp)
16-18: TCA (Ser)
19-21: CTT (Leu)
22-24: CTG (Leu)
25-27: GGA (Gly)
28-30: TGA (stop)
...

So the

---------------

 codons after the mutation are:

ATG, TTT, TTA, CGC, TGG, TCA, CTT, CTG, GGA, TGA.

So the stop codon is at position 28-30. But

---------------

 in the wild-type, the stop codon is at the end. So in mutant3, the stop is introduced earlier. So the protein would be shorter. Depending

---------------

 on where the stop is, it could disrupt the function.

But wait, in the given sequences, the mutant3 ends with ...TGA-3’, just like the wild-type. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look

---------------

 again.

Wait, the wild-type ends with TGA, as does mutant3. So perhaps the stop codon is still

---------------

 at the end, but the earlier codons are changed.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about what

---------------

 each mutation does.

The question asks which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That would happen if the gene is nonfunctional, so

---------------

 the compound isn't produced.

To make the gene nonfunctional, the mutation should disrupt the coding sequence, either by causing a frameshift (which changes most of the downstream amino acids) or by introducing a premature stop codon.

Looking again at the options:

Mutant 1: No

---------------

 stop codon. Changes in codons, but in-frame. So the protein is altered but may still function.

Mutant 2: Same as above. No stop, in frame.

Mutant3: Int

---------------

roduces a stop codon in the middle? Wait, in the codon list I made earlier, mutant3's 10th codon is CGC (Arg), 11th is TGG (Trp), 12th is TCA (Ser), 13th is CTT (Leu), 14th is CTG (Leu), 15th is GGA (Gly), and 16th is TGA (stop). So the stop is introduced at

---------------

 position 16. So the protein would be shorter, missing the last 10 amino acids or so. This could disrupt the function.

Mutant4: No

---------------

 stop codon introduced. Just changes in some codons, but in frame. So the protein may be altered but not necessarily nonfunctional.

Wait, but wait

---------------

. Let me make sure. In mutant3, the stop is introduced early. So the protein would be shorter. That would likely make it nonfunctional, especially

---------------

 if it's a critical region.

So among the options, mutant3 (option B) would cause a premature stop codon, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Wait, but looking

---------------

 back, I'm a bit confused because in the mutant3 sequence, the stop codon is at the same position as in the wild-type. Or

---------------

 is it?

Wait, no, in the wild-type, the stop codon is at the end, so the sequence continues

---------------

 beyond that. In mutant3, perhaps the stop codon is introduced earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should count the number of nucleotides.



---------------

Wild-type: Let's count the length up to the stop codon.

Wild-type starts with ATG followed by TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Let

---------------

 me count the letters before TGA:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA.

Each triplet is 3 nucleotides, so let

---------------

's count:

ATG (3) TTT (6) CTC (9) GCT (12) GGT (15) ACT (18) TCT (21) GTG (24) GAT (27) GAA (30) CAT (33) ATT (36) TAT (39) TGT (42) CGT (45) ... TGA (48).

So 48 nucleotides before the stop.

In mutant3: sequence is ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Breaking into triplets:

ATG (3)
TTT (6)
TAC (9)
GCT (12)
GGT (15)
GTC (18)
ACT (21)
TCT (24)
GTG (27)
GAT (30)
GAA (33)
CAT (36)
ATT (39)
TAT (42)
TGT (45)
CGT (48)
... TGA (51).

Wait, so the stop codon is at 51, which is three nucleotides after position 48. So the wild-type's stop is at 48, mutant3's is at 51. So no

---------------

, the stop codon is not earlier. So I must have made a mistake earlier.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for a frameshift.

---------------

 Let's see if any of the mutants have a change in the number of nucleotides, which would cause a frameshift.

Looking at the sequences:

Mutant1: same

---------------

 length as wild-type? Let me see.

Wild-type sequence before TGA: 50 nucleotides (since 48 before stop plus 3 for TGA is

---------------

 51? Not sure, but the important part is whether the number of nucleotides changed.

If the number of nucleotides is not a multiple of three, that would cause a frameshift.

Looking at each mutant's sequence:

Mutant1: same length as wild-type? It seems so. So no frameshift.

Mutant2: same length. No frameshift.

Mutant3: same length? Yes

---------------

. So no frameshift.

Mutant4: same length? Let me check.

Wild-type: ...TTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant4: ...TTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 in mutant4, the sequence is shorter. Let me count the nucleotides.

Wild-type: Let's count the letters

---------------

 after ATG.

ATG (3) TTT (6) CTC (9) GCT (12) GGT (15) ACT (18) TCT (21) GTG (24) GAT (27) GAA (30) CAT (33) ATT (36) TAT (39) TGT (42) CGT (45) ... TGA (48).

Mutant4: ATG (3) TTT (6) TTA (9) CGC (12) TAC (15) TTT (18) CTT (21) GTG (24) GAT (27) GAA (30) CAT (33) ATT (36) TAT (39) TGT (42) CGT (45) ... TGA (48).

Same length, so no frameshift.

Hmm, this

---------------

 is confusing. Maybe I should think of another approach. The question says that the mutation is in the first exon area. So the

---------------

 mutations are in the coding region.

The goal is to disrupt the gene. So perhaps a nonsense mutation (early stop) or a frameshift that

---------------

 disrupts the protein.

Looking at the options, only Mutant3 introduces a stop codon in the middle. Wait, no

---------------

, because earlier analysis suggested the stop is at the same position.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me look

---------------

 again.

Mutant3's sequence: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Breaking into triplets:

ATG, TTT, TTA, CGC, TGG, TCA, CTT, CTG, GGA, TGA.

So the stop codon is at the 10th position. In

---------------

 the wild-type, the stop is much later. So the stop is introduced early, leading to a truncated protein.

Wait, that can't be right because the stop

---------------

 in the mutant3 is at position 10, but in the wild-type, the stop is at position 16 (if

---------------

 I count correctly). So in mutant3, the stop is introduced much earlier, leading to a much shorter protein.

If that's the case, then Mutant3 would likely

---------------

 disrupt the gene function.

But why didn't I notice this earlier? Because when I was looking at the entire sequence, I thought the stop was at the same point, but actually

---------------

, the stop is much earlier in mutant3.

So, the correct answer would be Mutant3 (option B), as it introduces a premature stop codon.


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we need to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. This can occur through a frameshift mutation (altering the reading frame) or a nonsense mutation (introducing a premature stop codon). The question provides four mutants, and we analyze each for these disruptive effects.

### Intact Gene Sequence:
```
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
```
The start codon is **ATG**, and the stop codon is **TGA** at the end.

---

### Mutant 1:
```
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
```
- **Changes**: 
  - Codon 7-9: **CTC** (Leu) → **CTA** (Leu)
  - Codon 10-12: **GCT** (Ala) → **CGC** (Arg)
- **Analysis**: No frameshift or premature stop codon. The mutation introduces an in-frame alteration, likely resulting in a functional protein with altered amino acids. This does not eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

---

### Mutant 2:
```
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
```
- **Changes**:
  - Codon 7-9: **CTC** (Leu) → **CTA** (Leu)
  - Codon 10-12: **GCT** (Ala) → **AGC** (Ser)
  - Codon 13-15: **GGT** (Gly) → **TGG** (Trp)
- **Analysis**: No frameshift or premature stop codon. The mutation introduces in-frame changes, likely resulting in a functional protein with altered amino acids. This does not eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

---

### Mutant 3:
```
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
```
- **Changes**:
  - Codon 7-9: **CTC** (Leu) → **TTA** (Leu)
  - Codon 10-12: **GCT** (Ala) → **CGC** (Arg)
  - Codon 13-15: **GGT** (Gly) → **TGG** (Trp)
  - Codon 16-18: **ACT** (Thr) → **TCA** (Ser)
  - Codon 19-21: **TCT** (Ser) → **CTT** (Leu)
  - Codon 22-24: **GTG** (Val) → **CTG** (Leu)
  - Codon 25-27: **GAT** (Asp) → **GGA** (Gly)
  - Codon 28-30: **TGA** (stop codon introduced)
- **Analysis**: A premature stop codon (**TGA**) is introduced at position 28-30, significantly shortening the protein. This disrupts the protein's structure and function, effectively eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.

---

### Mutant 4:

- **Changes**:
  - Codon 7-9: **CTC** (Leu) → **TTA** (Leu)
  - Codon 10-12: **GCT** (Ala) → **CGC** (Arg)
  - Codon 13-15: **GGT** (Gly) → **TAC** (Tyr)
- **Analysis**: No frameshift or premature stop codon. The mutation introduces in-frame changes, likely resulting in a functional protein with altered amino acids. This does not eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

---

### Conclusion:
Among the mutants, **Mutant 3** introduces a premature stop codon (**TGA**), which disrupts the gene's function and eliminates the anti-nutritional compound.
