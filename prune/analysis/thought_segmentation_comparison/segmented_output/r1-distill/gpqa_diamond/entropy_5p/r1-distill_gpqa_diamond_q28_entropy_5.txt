Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. 

So the question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking for the one that eliminates the compound. 

The intact

---------------

 gene's sequence starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA. Each

---------------

 mutant has some changes in the first exon area.

I remember that EMS (Ethyl Methanesulfonate) is a mutagen that primarily causes point mutations, usually substitutions. So each mutant probably has a substitution in the DNA sequence. 

The goal is to find a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, thereby

---------------

 eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. So we need a mutation that causes a premature stop codon or changes the protein structure enough to make it non-functional.

Looking at the options, each mutant shows a change in the first exon. Exons are coding regions, so any mutation here would affect the protein.

Let me look at each mutant's sequence:

Intact gene: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Wait

---------------

, comparing to the intact gene, the first part is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGT... So let's see

---------------

 where the change is.

Looking at the first part: the intact is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT… 

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC… 

Hmm, let

---------------

's compare. The intact has TTCTC GCTGGTACTT. Mutant1 has TTCTA CGCTGGTACTT. Wait, maybe

---------------

 I should count the letters. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to see where the change occurs. Let me write out the first

---------------

 part:

Intact: positions 1-20 maybe?

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …

---------------

 TGA

Mutant1: ATG TTT CT CAG C TGG TACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC …

Wait, not sure. Maybe I

---------------

 should look for where the change is in the sequence. Let me see the first exon in more detail.

Looking at the initial

---------------

 part:

Intact: starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT… 

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC… 

So the

---------------

 difference is in the first part. Let's line them up.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT

---------------

 ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

Mutant1: ATG TTT CT ACG C TGG TACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC …

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the fourth codon is different. The fourth codon in the intact is CTC (which is Leu), but in mutant1 it's CT ACG? Hmm, maybe I should think

---------------

 in terms of individual nucleotides.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for where the mutation occurred. Let me look

---------------

 for the exact point.

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Looking

---------------

 for differences. Let's break it down:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ...



---------------

Mutant1: ATG TTT CT ACG C TGG TACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ...

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the third codon is different. Let me compare each position.

Looking at the first 12 nucleotides:

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTG

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTG

Wait, let

---------------

's count each position.

Positions 1-3: ATG (same)
Positions 4-6: TTT (same)
Positions 7-9: CTC (intact) vs CT A (mutant1

---------------

). Hmm, perhaps I should index the sequences.

Alternatively, perhaps the change is in the third codon after the start. Let me count

---------------

 the letters:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … 

Mutant1: ATG TTT CT ACG C TGG TACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … 

So,

---------------

 the third codon in the intact is CTC (Leu), and in mutant1, it's CTA (Leu again

---------------

). Wait, that's same? Or maybe I'm getting the positions wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's the fourth codon.

Wait, the

---------------

 intact gene has CT CGC TGG TAC TTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Wait, maybe I should line

---------------

 them up:

Intact: positions 1-20:
1-3: ATG
4-6: TTT
7-9: CTC
10-12: GCT
13-15: GGT
16-18: ACT
19-21: TCT
22-24: GTG
25-27: GAT
28-30: GAA
31-33: CAT
34-36: ATT
37-39: TAT
40-42: TGT
43-45: CGT
... then

---------------

 TGA.

Mutant1: same positions:
1-3: ATG
4-6: TTT
7-9: CTA (maybe

---------------

)
Wait, perhaps the fourth codon is different. Let's see:

Mutant1's sequence: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Wait

---------------

, perhaps it's easier to see the exact change. Let me look for where the letters differ.

Intact: ...TT

---------------

CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT… 

Mutant1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC… 

Ah, so

---------------

 in the intact, the sequence is TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGA...

In mutant1, it's TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGA...

So the change is from

---------------

 TTCTCGC to TTCTACG. Let me see which nucleotides have changed.

Looking at the third cod

---------------

on after TTT (position 7-9):

Intact: CTC (Leu)
Mutant1: CT A? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe the

---------------

 fifth codon is different. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution in the middle of a codon.

Alternatively, perhaps the fourth

---------------

 codon in the intact is GCT (Ala), and in mutant1, it's ACG (Thr). So

---------------

 that's a substitution from Ala to Thr. So, a point mutation, but doesn't cause a stop.

Similarly, looking at mutant2:

Mutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So comparing

---------------

 to the intact, which has CT CGC TGG TAC. Mutant2 has CT AAG C TGG TAC.

Wait, so

---------------

 in the intact, it's CGCTGGTACT, which would be CGC TGG TAC (Ala Trp Tyr).

Mutant2's sequence:

---------------

 AAG C TGG TAC. So the codon after TTT would be CT AAG C... Wait, perhaps I should look

---------------

 at the exact letters.

In the intact, the sequence is TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT… 

Mutant2: TTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC… 

So the change is from TTCTCGC TGGTACT to TTCTAAG C TGGTACT.

So the

---------------

 first part, after TTT, the intact has CTCGCTG G TAC, while mutant2 has CTAA G C TGG TAC.

Hmm, that might mean that in

---------------

 mutant2, the third codon is changed. Let me see: the third codon in the intact is CTC (Leu), and in mutant2, it's CTA (Leu again).

---------------

 Then the next codon in intact is GCT (Ala), and in mutant2, it's AAG (Lys). So that

---------------

's a substitution from Ala to Lys. Still a point mutation but not a stop.

Mutant3:

Mutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So

---------------

 the intact has TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant3's sequence: TTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

So the change is from TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTG to TTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTG.

Looking at the sequence

---------------

, perhaps the fourth codon is changed. Let me count the codons.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …

Mutant3: ATG TTT TT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …

So the third codon in intact is CTC (Leu), in mutant3, it's TTA (Leu again). Then the fourth codon in intact is GCT (Ala), and in mutant3 it's GCT (Ala).

---------------

 Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the fifth codon is different.

Wait, let's look at the exact

---------------

 nucleotides:

In the intact, the first part is TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

In mutant3, it's TTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

So in the intact

---------------

, after TTT, it's CTCGCTG G TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

In mutant3, after TTT, it's TTA CGC TGG GTG TCA CTTCTGTG GAT...

So, perhaps the change

---------------

 is in the codon after CTCGCTG G TAC. Wait, perhaps the change is in the third codon.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I should look for a frame shift or a stop codon. Because if a mutation introduces a stop codon early, that would truncate the protein, possibly making it non-functional.

Looking at the options, which

---------------

 mutant has a mutation that causes a stop codon?

Let's examine each mutant.

Stop codons are TAA, TAG, and TGA. So

---------------

 any mutation that creates one of these in the reading frame would cause a premature stop.

Looking at the sequences, the end is ...TGA, which is a stop codon. So perhaps

---------------

 the end is the same.

Wait, but the start is ATG, so the reading frame is determined from there.

Let me look

---------------

 for any mutation that introduces a stop codon.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant1:

Sequence after ATG: TTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Looking

---------------

 for any TAA, TAG, or TGA codons.

Looking at the sequence, let's see:

Looking for triple

---------------

ts:

TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Wait, CG

---------------

C is codon, then TGG, then TAC. So no stop codons.

Mutant2:

ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

So

---------------

 the sequence is:

TTT CTA AAG C TGG TAC TTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Looking

---------------

 for stop codons. AAG is Lys. TGG is Trp. TAC is Tyr. No stop codons.

Mutant3:

ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

So after ATG, the sequence is TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Looking for triple

---------------

ts:

TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, TAC is Tyr, GCT is Ala, GGT is Gly, GTC is Val, ACT is Thr, TCT is Ser, GTG is Val, GAT is Asp. No stop codons here.

Mutant4:

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So the sequence is:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA.

So after

---------------

 ATG, TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Looking for triplets:

TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So TAC is Tyr, GCT is Ala, ACT is Thr, TCT is Ser, GTG is Val, GAT is Asp. Hmm

---------------

, but wait, looking at the start.

Wait, in the intact gene, the fifth codon is GCT (Ala), but

---------------

 in mutant4, after TTT, the next codon is TAC (Tyr), then GCT (Ala), but wait

---------------

, let's see the exact sequence.

Wait, the intact gene's sequence in this region is TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

In mutant4, it's TTCTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re

---------------

-examine.

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So after ATG, it's TT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So the first codon is ATG (start), second is TTT (Phe), third is TAC (Tyr), fourth is GCT (Ala), fifth is ACT (Thr), sixth is TCT (Ser), seventh is GTG (Val), eighth is GAT (Asp), etc.

Wait, but the

---------------

 original gene has after ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So in mutant4, the third codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). So

---------------

 that's a substitution from Leu to Tyr. No stop codon here.

Wait, but let's check if any of the mutations lead

---------------

 to a frameshift. Frameshifts would change all downstream codons, possibly creating a stop codon earlier.

Looking at the mutations, they

---------------

 all appear to be point mutations (substitutions) since the sequence length is the same. So no insertions or deletions,

---------------

 so no frameshifts. So, no new in-frame stop codons due to frameshift.

Wait, but maybe a

---------------

 substitution creates a stop codon in the same frame.

Looking again at the sequences:

Mutant1:

Looking for any triplet that is TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Looking

---------------

 at the sequence after ATG:

TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

So

---------------

, looking for TAA, TAG, TGA. The last part is TGA at the very end, but that's the normal stop. The question

---------------

 is whether any mutation introduces a stop codon before that.

Mutant1: ...GTCGC… so the codon is CGC, which is Arg. No

---------------

 stop.

Mutant2:

...AAG C TGG TAC TTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

AAG is Lys, C is part of the next codon. No stops.

Mutant3:

...GTCGT… which

---------------

 is Val. No stops.

Mutant4:

Looking at the sequence, after ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

No

---------------

 stop codons in the first few codons.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Another

---------------

 approach: a mutation that disrupts the gene's function could be a missense mutation that changes an essential amino acid, but without

---------------

 knowing which amino acids are critical, it's hard to say. Alternatively, a nonsense mutation (stop codon) would definitely disrupt the protein.

Looking at the mutants, which

---------------

 one introduces a stop codon?

Wait, looking at mutant4's sequence:

The end is ...TGA-3’

---------------

 as the terminator. But the rest is normal. So where is the change?

Wait, in the intact gene, the sequence after ATG is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

In mutant4, it's TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, the change

---------------

 is in the fourth codon. The intact has GCT (Ala) as the fourth codon, but in mutant4, it's ACT (Thr). Wait, no. Wait, no

---------------

, the fourth codon in intact is GCT (Ala), but in mutant4, the third codon is TAC (Tyr), then GCT (Ala), then

---------------

 ACT (Thr). So the fourth codon in mutant4 is ACT (Thr), whereas in the intact, it's GCT (Ala). Hmm, but

---------------

 that's just a substitution.

Wait, perhaps I should look for any mutation that creates a stop codon in the coding sequence.

Looking back at the sequences:

Mutant 4's sequence:

---------------

 ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

Wait, the

---------------

 last part before TGA is TGT CGT. TGT is Cys, CGT is Arg.

Hmm, I

---------------

 don't see a stop codon introduced. So perhaps none of the mutations cause a premature stop.

Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me think again

---------------

.

Alternatively, perhaps a mutation causes a frameshift, but since the length is the same, that's not the case. So all are point mutations.

Hmm

---------------

, so perhaps the question is which mutation disrupts the gene function, not necessarily by a stop codon but by a critical amino acid change.

But without knowing which amino acids are critical, it's tricky. Alternatively, maybe one of the mutations leads

---------------

 to a premature stop.

Wait, perhaps looking at the mutant4's sequence, let me count the nucleotides after the mutation.

Wait, in

---------------

 the intact gene, the part after ATG is TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

In mutant4, it's TTCTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Wait, perhaps I'm getting

---------------

 mixed up. Let me try to write the exact regions.

Intact: ...TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant4: ...TTCTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Wait, looking

---------------

 at the exact change:

Intact: TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant4: TTCTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

So, the first

---------------

 part is TTCTCGC in intact, and in mutant4, it's TTCTTAC.

So, the change

---------------

 is from CGC to TAC. Let me see what that does.

Wait, in the intact, the sequence is:

After

---------------

 TTCTC, the next is GCTGGTACT. So, the codons would be CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), etc.

In mutant4, after TTCTT, it's AC GCTACT. So, the codons would be TTA (Leu), C GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), etc.

Wait, perhaps I should look

---------------

 for any stop codons in the coding regions.

Another approach: the question is which mutation would most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That would

---------------

 require the gene product to be non-functional. So, the best way is to have a mutation that leads to a non-functional protein.

If

---------------

 the mutation creates a stop codon early in the sequence, the protein would be shorter and likely non-functional.

Looking again:

Mutant1: No

---------------

 stop codon.

Mutant2: No stop.

Mutant3: No stop.

Mutant4: No stop.

Hmm, then

---------------

 perhaps the correct approach is to look for a mutation that disrupts the reading frame, but as I thought earlier, all are substitutions, so no frame shifts.

Wait, wait

---------------

 a second. Let me look at the sequences again.

Mutant4's sequence:

Looking at the initial part, perhaps the change

---------------

 is in the first exon, but does it create a stop codon? Let me see:

Mutant4's sequence after

---------------

 ATG is TT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, codons are TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), etc.

No stop codons.

---------------

 So perhaps none of the mutations introduce a stop. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the mutation disrupts a critical region of the gene. For example, if

---------------

 the mutation is in a critical exon region, such as a catalytic site, it could disable the protein.

Looking at the sequences

---------------

, perhaps the change in Mutant4 disrupts a crucial part. Let me compare the sequences.

In the intact gene, the first few codons after ATG are Phe (TTT), Leu (CTC), Ala (GCT), Gly (GGT), Thr (ACT), Ser (TCT), Val (GTG), Asp (GAT), etc.

In Mutant4, after Phe (TTT), it's Tyr (TAC), Ala (GCT), Thr (ACT), Ser (TCT), Val (GTG), Asp (GAT), etc.

So, the substitution

---------------

 is from Leu (CTC) to Tyr (TAC). That's a significant change in the second codon. Le

---------------

u is hydrophobic, Tyr is aromatic. But without knowing the structure, it's hard to say if this is critical.

Wait

---------------

, another approach: perhaps one of the mutations leads to a shorter mRNA due to a mutation in the intron-exon boundaries, but the question says the mutations are in the first exon area, so likely

---------------

 within the coding region.

Wait, but the question states that all mutations are in the target gene, which is the gene for the anti-nutritional compound. So,

---------------

 the correct mutation would disrupt the gene's function.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the mutations creates a splice donor or acceptor site, but the problem states that the changes are in the exon area.

Wait, but

---------------

 the question says that all mutants have changes in the first exon area. So, they're in exons, meaning they're in the coding regions.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the correct answer is Mutant4, which has a larger change in the sequence.

Wait, let's count the nucleotides in

---------------

 the intact and each mutant.

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Length: Let's count the letters before

---------------

 the ellipsis. Let's see: ATG is 3, then TTT (6), CTC (9), GCT (12), GGT (15), ACT (18), TCT (21), GTG (24), GAT (27), GAA (30), CAT (33), ATT (36), TAT (39), TGT (42), CGT (45). Then ...TGA.

So from

---------------

 ATG to CGT is 15 codons (positions 1-45), then TGA.

Now, looking at Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So the first part is ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Which is 15 nucleotides as

---------------

 well. So no frameshift.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, the sequence is missing some nucleotides, but it

---------------

's the same length as the intact.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The question asks which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, the

---------------

 gene product is non-functional. So, a mutation that creates a premature stop codon would be ideal.

Looking again, perhaps

---------------

 I missed a stop codon in one of the mutants.

Wait, let me check Mutant3's sequence:

Mutant3: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So the sequence after ATG is TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So the codons are: TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), GTC (Val), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), etc.

No stop codon here.

Wait, what

---------------

 about Mutant4:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

No stop codons.

Hmm, perhaps none of the mutations create a stop codon. Then the answer

---------------

 must be based on which mutation is most likely to disrupt the protein structure.

Looking at each mutation:

Mutant1: Change

---------------

 in the third codon from CTC (Leu) to CTA (Leu) and then CGC (Arg) in the fourth codon? Wait, no

---------------

.

Wait, the fourth codon in the intact is GCT (Ala), and in Mutant1, it's ACG (Thr). So substitution from Ala to Thr. That

---------------

's a conservative change perhaps.

Mutant2: Change in the fourth codon from GCT (Ala) to AAG (Lys). That's a more significant change, from small to charged.

Mutant3: Change in the third codon from CTC (Leu) to TTA (Leu), so

---------------

 same amino acid. Then fourth codon from GCT (Ala) to GCT (Ala) again. Wait, but wait

---------------

, perhaps the fifth codon is different.

Wait, in the intact, the fifth codon is GGT (Gly), and in Mutant3, it's GGT (Gly) again. Wait, no, perhaps

---------------

 I'm miscalculating.

Wait, let me think again about Mutant3.

In intact, after ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

In Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, the third codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). Oh wait, so

---------------

 the third codon is changed from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). That's a substitution from hydrophobic (Leu) to aromatic (Tyr). Could this disrupt a critical part of the protein?

Similarly

---------------

, in Mutant4, the third codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). So same as Mutant3?



---------------

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong. Let me try to index each codon.

Intact:

1: ATG (start)
2: TTT (Phe)
3: CTC (Leu)
4: GCT (Ala)
5: GGT (Gly)
6: ACT (Thr)
7: TCT (Ser)
8: GTG (Val)
9: GAT (Asp)
10: GAA (Glu)
... and so on.

Mutant1:

1: ATG
2: TTT
3: CTA (Leu)
4: ACG (Thr)
5: GCT (Ala)
6: ACT (Thr)
7: TCT (Ser)
8: GTG (Val)
9: GAT (Asp)
...

So, in

---------------

 Mutant1, the fourth codon is ACG (Thr) instead of GCT (Ala). So a substitution from Ala to Thr.

Mutant2:

1: ATG
2: TTT
3: CT A (wait

---------------

, perhaps the third codon is CTA (Leu))
Wait, let me see. The sequence for Mutant2 is:

ATG TTT CT AAG C TGG TACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, after ATG and TTT (positions 1 and 2), the third codon is CT A (no

---------------

, that's not a triplet). Wait, perhaps the sequence is:

ATG TTT CT AAG C TGG TACT...

So, the

---------------

 third codon is CT AAG? No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps the third codon is CT A, which isn't a full codon. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps the correct

---------------

 way is to compare the exact nucleotide sequences.

Let me take the first 24 nucleotides of each:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT G

---------------

AA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA.

Mutant1: ATG TTT CT ACG C TGG TACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA.

Mutant2: ATG TTT CT AAG C TGG TACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA.

Mutant3: ATG TTT TT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA.

Mutant4: ATG TTT TT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA.

Wait, perhaps I

---------------

 should look for a mutation that introduces a stop codon.

Looking at Mutant3's sequence: ...TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...

No

---------------

 TAA, TAG, or TGA in the first few codons.

Wait, but looking at Mutant4: after TTT, it's TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

No stop codons.

Hmm. Maybe

---------------

 I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options.

The question is about which mutation would eliminate the compound. So, perhaps

---------------

 the mutation that disrupts the gene's function is the one where a crucial part of the gene is altered.

Another approach: the

---------------

 presence of a nonsense mutation (stop codon) would be the most effective in knocking out the gene.

Looking again, perhaps I missed a stop codon in one of the mutants.

Wait, in Mutant4, the sequence is ...TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Looking

---------------

 for triplets:

TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp).

No stop codons.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I should look beyond the initial part.

In the intact gene, the sequence continues beyond the initial part. Let's say the

---------------

 first few codons are Phe, Leu, Ala, Gly, Thr, Ser, Val, Asp, Glu, His, Ile, Ile, Tyr, Cys, Arg, and then stop.

In Mutant4, the sequence after ATG is:

Phe (TTT), Tyr (TAC), Ala (GCT), Thr (ACT), Ser (TCT), Val (GTG), Asp (GAT), Glu (GAA), His (CAT), Ile (ATT), Tyr (TAT), Cys (TGT), Arg (CGT), and then stop.

No stop codons introduced

---------------

.

Hmm. So none of the mutations introduce a stop codon. Then, perhaps the correct answer is based on which mutation is

---------------

 most likely to disrupt the gene's function through a missense mutation in a critical region.

But without knowing which region is critical, it's hard to say. However, the question states

---------------

 that the mutations are at the beginning of the first exon. So the early part of the gene.

A mutation early in the gene could disrupt the start codon or the initial structure.

Wait, the start codon is ATG, and all mutants have ATG as the first three nucleotides, so the start is intact.

So

---------------

, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has a larger change in the early exons, perhaps leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Wait, looking at Mutant4's sequence:

After

---------------

 the start, the sequence is TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

In the intact, it's TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So the third codon is changed from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). That's a significant change. Le

---------------

u is a hydrophobic residue, while Tyr is hydroxylated and has a phenol group. This could disrupt the structure of the protein, possibly leading to a nonfunctional product.

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1, which has a change in the fourth codon from GCT (Ala) to ACG (Thr). Ala is a small, neutral residue, and Thr is also small but has a hydroxyl group. This substitution might have less impact than a Leu to Tyr change.

So

---------------

, considering the options, Mutant3 changes the third codon from Leu to Leu (same amino acid, because

---------------

 CTA is Leu as well?), wait no. Wait, CTA is Leu, TAC is Tyr. So in Mutant3, the third codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). So that's a substitution from Leu to Tyr.

Wait

---------------

, no, in Mutant3, the third codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). So that's a change

---------------

 in amino acid.

Wait, but in the intact gene, the third codon is CTC (Leu), and in Mutant3, it's TAC (Tyr), which is a different amino acid.

So

---------------

, which mutation changes a crucial residue? Without knowing which part of the protein is important, it's hard to say, but the question is

---------------

 looking for the most probable.

Another angle: the question says the compound is anti-nutritional. So, perhaps disrupting the gene would prevent

---------------

 its production. So any mutation that disrupts the gene's function, whether by stop codon or by altering the protein structure, would be acceptable.

But since

---------------

 none of the mutations introduce a stop codon, perhaps the intended answer is the one where a stop codon is introduced. But I must

---------------

 have missed it.

Wait, looking again, perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing the sequences.

Let me look at Mutant4's sequence again:

Mutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So the sequence is ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So

---------------

 the third codon is TAC (Tyr), fourth is GCT (Ala), fifth is ACT (Thr), sixth is TCT (Ser), seventh is GTG (Val), eighth is GAT (Asp), ninth is GAA (Glu), tenth is CAT (His), eleventh is ATT (Ile), twelfth is TAT (Tyr), thirteenth is TGT (Cys), fourteenth is CGT (Arg), then TGA (stop).

Wait a minute! The

---------------

 last codon before the stop is CGT (Arg), then TGA. So the stop is at the end, which is normal.

But in

---------------

 Mutant4, perhaps the CGT is followed by TGA, so that's the normal stop. So no early stop.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the mutation in

---------------

 Mutant4 leads to a frameshift, but earlier I thought all mutations were substitutions, not insertions or deletions. But

---------------

 looking again, perhaps not.

Wait, looking at the length of the sequences:

The intact gene sequence is 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’


---------------

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Wait

---------------

, perhaps the sequence in Mutant4 is missing some nucleotides. Let me count the letters before the ellipsis.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT (

---------------

that's 24 nucleotides, 8 codons).

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT (that's 18 nucleotides, 6 codons). Wait, no, that

---------------

 can't be. The sequences are the same length, so perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, perhaps the sequences are the

---------------

 same length, so no frameshift.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about which mutation is most likely to disrupt the gene.

If

---------------

 I'm stuck, perhaps I should think about the options given. The options are A to D, with the choices being Mutant1, 2,3,4.

The question states that the correct

---------------

 mutation will let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, implying that the gene product is non-functional.

Since none of the mutations create a premature stop codon, perhaps the correct answer is the one where the change is in a critical region, perhaps leading to a nonfunctional enzyme.

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, which has a large change in the sequence, perhaps disrupting a crucial part.

Wait, looking

---------------

 at the sequences again:

Mutant4's sequence after ATG is TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

In the intact gene, it's TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So the third codon is changed from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). That's a significant change in the third codon. Maybe

---------------

 that's in a critical region.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it's the only one where the sequence

---------------

 in the first exon is altered in a way that removes a part of the coding region, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a nonsense mutation. If

---------------

 any of the mutations creates a stop codon early, that's the answer. But I can't find any.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a stop codon in Mutant4.

Looking again: the

---------------

 sequence in Mutant4 after the change is ...TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So the codons are TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAT (His), ATT (Ile), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys), CGT (Arg), then TGA (stop).

No early stops.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe

---------------

 the intended answer is Mutant4 because it's the only one that changes the third codon to a different amino acid, thus

---------------

 disrupting the protein structure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a mutation that changes a codon to a stop codon.

Wait, in

---------------

 Mutant4, the third codon is TAC (Tyr), which is not a stop. What about the fifth codon?

In Mutant4, the fifth codon is ACT (Thr), which is not a stop.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe

---------------

 the correct answer is Mutant4 because it's the only one that changes the third codon from Leu to Tyr, which could disrupt the protein's function.

But I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1, which changes a codon from GCT (Ala) to ACG (Thr), which is a substitution

---------------

 that might affect the protein's structure.

Wait, but without more information, it's hard to decide. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is Mutant4, which changes the third codon to Tyr, which

---------------

 is a significant change.


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the mutations introduced in the first exon of the gene. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, either by introducing a premature stop codon or by altering a critical region of the protein.

### Key Observations:
1. **Intact Gene Sequence**:  
   The intact gene starts with `ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA`.  
   The first few codons are:  
   - ATG (start)  
   - TTT (Phe)  
   - CTC (Leu)  
   - GCT (Ala)  
   - GGT (Gly)  
   - ACT (Thr)  
   - TCT (Ser)  
   - GTG (Val)  
   - GAT (Asp)  
   - GAA (Glu)  
   - CAT (His)  
   - ATT (Ile)  
   - TAT (Tyr)  
   - TGT (Cys)  
   - CGT (Arg)  
   - TGA (stop).

2. **Mutant 1**:  
   Sequence: `ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA`.  
   Changes:  
   - Codon 3: CTC (Leu) → CTA (Leu) (no change in amino acid).  
   - Codon 4: GCT (Ala) → ACG (Thr) (substitution).  
   - No premature stop codon introduced.

3. **Mutant 2**:  
   Sequence: `ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA`.  
   Changes:  
   - Codon 3: CTC (Leu) → CTA (Leu) (no change in amino acid).  
   - Codon 4: GCT (Ala) → AAG (Lys) (substitution).  
   - No premature stop codon introduced.

4. **Mutant 3**:  
   Sequence: `ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA`.  
   Changes:  
   - Codon 3: CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr) (substitution).  
   - Codon 5: GGT (Gly) → GTC (Val) (substitution).  
   - No premature stop codon introduced.

5. **Mutant 4**:  
   Sequence: `ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA`.  
   Changes:  
   - Codon 3: CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr) (substitution).  
   - Codon 4: GCT (Ala) → ACT (Thr) (substitution).  
   - No premature stop codon introduced.

### Analysis:
- **None of the mutations introduce a premature stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA) within the coding sequence**, so the disruption must arise from a missense mutation altering a critical amino acid.
- **Mutant 3** changes codon 3 from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr), which is a significant substitution from a hydrophobic (Leu) to an aromatic (Tyr) residue. This could disrupt a critical region of the protein, potentially rendering it non-functional.
- **Mutant 4** also changes codon 3 from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr), similar to Mutant 3, but the additional substitution in codon 4 (GCT → ACT) may further destabilize the protein.
- **Mutant 1** and **Mutant 2** introduce less impactful substitutions, with conservative changes in codon 3 and more moderate changes in codon 4.

### Conclusion:
The most likely mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound is **Mutant 4**, as it introduces two significant substitutions early in the coding sequence, disrupting the gene's function.
