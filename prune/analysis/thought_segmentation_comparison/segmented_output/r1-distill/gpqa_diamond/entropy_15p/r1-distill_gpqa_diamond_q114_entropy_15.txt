Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure it out. Hmm

---------------

, the question is about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. The setup is a bit specific, so I'll need to break

---------------

 it down.

Alright, so the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. The

---------------

 positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured

---------------

—one upper-right, the other lower-right. We need to find the angle between them.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma is

---------------

 the factor by which time and length dilate in special relativity. But for this problem, I think it's more about the

---------------

 energies and momenta of the particles before the collision. Because when they annihilate, energy and momentum are conserved, so the photons' energies and directions must match

---------------

 that.

So, first, I should find the rest masses and their relativistic energies. The rest mass of an electron and positron is the same: m_e =

---------------

 9.109e-31 kg, but wait, actually, for calculations, sometimes it's easier to work in units where c=1 and use

---------------

 energies in terms of rest mass energy. But I'm not sure yet.

Wait, the problem states that both photons have the same energy. So each

---------------

 photon has energy E_photon = same value. Since the total energy from the annihilation must equal the sum of the electron and positron's energies.

But

---------------

 let's get into the initial setup. The electron and positron are moving towards each other on the same axis. So the

---------------

 electron is moving to the right (from left), and the positron is moving to the left (from right). So their velocities are opposite in

---------------

 direction.

I need to compute their relativistic momenta and energies before collision.

The Lorentz factor gamma is given for

---------------

 each. So for the electron, gamma_e = 4. For the positron, gamma_p = 2.

Wait

---------------

, but wait a second: the positron has the same mass as the electron, right? So their rest masses are the same. So m

---------------

_e for both.

So the total energy before collision is the sum of their relativistic energies. The relativistic energy E is gamma * m_e c². So

---------------

 E_e = 4 m_e c², E_p = 2 m_e c². So total energy is 6 m_e c².

But

---------------

 when they annihilate, the energy goes into two photons, each with energy E_photon. Since E_photon1 = E_photon2 = E_ph

---------------

oton, each has E_photon = 3 m_e c². Because 2 E_photon = 6 m_e c².



---------------

Wait, but wait, photons carry momentum as well. The momentum of a photon is E/c, but since they're massless, p

---------------

 = E/c. But the direction of the momentum is the direction the photon is moving.

So the problem says one photon is moving upper-right, another lower-right. So their

---------------

 momenta are in different directions, but both in the right direction in the x-component. Wait, but the initial system has

---------------

 some momentum.

Wait, let's think about the total momentum before collision. Since the electron and positron are moving towards each other, their momenta are

---------------

 opposite in direction.

The electron's momentum is gamma_e * m_e v_e, but wait, velocity is a vector. So

---------------

 for the electron, moving to the right, its momentum is positive. The positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative.

But

---------------

 let's compute each's momentum in terms of gamma and mass.

The momentum p = gamma * m_e * v. But v

---------------

 can be expressed in terms of gamma. Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

Alternatively

---------------

, another way: p = gamma m_e v = gamma m_e (c) sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²)

---------------

 = m_e c sqrt( gamma² (1 - 1/gamma²) ) = m_e c sqrt( gamma² - 1 )



---------------

Wait, let me compute that again. Let me think about it.

Wait, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²))

---------------

.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1/(gamma²), so v = c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

So

---------------

 p = gamma m_e v = gamma m_e c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) = m_e c sqrt( gamma² (1 - 1/gamma²) ) =

---------------

 m_e c sqrt( gamma² - 1 )

Yes, that's right.

So for the electron, gamma_e =4,

---------------

 so p_e = m_e c sqrt(4² -1 ) = m_e c sqrt(15) ≈ m_e c * 3.87298.

But

---------------

 wait, the positron is moving in the opposite direction, so its momentum is negative. Its gamma_p is 2, so p_p = - m_e c sqrt(2² - 1) = - m_e c sqrt(3) ≈ - m_e c * 1.73205.

So the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e + p_p = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait

---------------

, wait, but the positron's momentum is in the opposite direction, so the electron's is positive, the positron's is negative. So p

---------------

_initial = p_e - |p_p|?

Wait, no. Let me think again: the electron is moving to the right, so its momentum is positive. The positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative. So when

---------------

 adding, the total momentum is p_e (positive) + p_p (negative).

So p_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait

---------------

, sqrt(15) is about 3.872, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 

---------------

3.872 - 1.732 ≈ 2.140 m_e c.

So the total initial momentum is approximately

---------------

 2.14 m_e c in the positive x-direction.

Now, after the collision, the photons must carry away momentum such

---------------

 that the total momentum equals the initial. Also, the photons' energies are equal, so each has energy E_photon = 3 m_e c².

Each

---------------

 photon's momentum is p_photon = E_photon / c = (3 m_e c²) / c = 3 m_e c.

But

---------------

 wait, the photon's momentum is a vector. So the first photon is moving upper-right, the second lower-right. So both

---------------

 have x-components in the positive direction and y-components either positive or negative.

Let me denote the angles. Let's say photon 1 makes an angle theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 makes an angle -theta below the x-axis.

---------------

 But wait, the problem states one is upper-right and the other lower-right, but not necessarily symmetric. Hmm, but the

---------------

 problem says that their energies are the same, which would imply their momenta magnitudes are the same. So their p vectors

---------------

 have the same magnitude but different directions.

So, since each photon has the same energy, and the same |p|,

---------------

 which is 3 m_e c.

So the momentum vectors are p1 = (3 m_e c) * (cos(theta

---------------

), sin(theta)) and p2 = (3 m_e c) * (cos(phi), sin(phi)), where theta is positive

---------------

 (upper) and phi is negative (lower). Or maybe theta is the angle from the x-axis for one, and phi

---------------

 is the same magnitude but in the opposite direction. Alternatively, perhaps they are symmetric about the x-axis.

Wait, but in

---------------

 the problem, one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So both have positive x-components, but one has positive y, the other negative.

So

---------------

, the sum of their momenta must equal the initial total momentum. Let's write the equations.

Total momentum after collision is

---------------

 p1 + p2 = (3 m_e c (cos(theta) + cos(phi)), 3 m_e c (sin(theta) + sin(phi))).

This must equal the initial momentum,

---------------

 which is (m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)), 0).

So, the x-component:

---------------

 3 m_e c (cos(theta) + cos(phi)) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Divide both sides by m_e c:

3 (cos(theta) + cos(phi)) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.87298 - 1.73205 ≈ 2.14093.

Wait

---------------

, but wait: sqrt(15) is approximately 3.872, sqrt(3) is about 1.732. So sqrt(15)-sqrt(3) ≈ 2.140.

So,

---------------

 3 (cos(theta) + cos(phi)) ≈ 2.140.

Divide both sides by 3: cos(theta) + cos(phi) ≈ 0.7133.

But

---------------

 wait, if the photons are symmetric about the x-axis, then phi = -theta. So let's test that possibility.

If phi = -theta, then cos(phi) = cos(theta), and sin(phi) = -sin(theta).

So,

---------------

 cos(theta) + cos(phi) = 2 cos(theta).

So equation becomes 2 cos(theta) ≈ 0.7133 → cos(theta) ≈ 0.35666 →

---------------

 theta ≈ arccos(0.35666) ≈ 69 degrees.

Wait, but

---------------

 wait, if theta is about 69 degrees, then the angle between the photons would be theta + |phi| = 69 +69=138 degrees? Because

---------------

 each is at +/- theta from the x-axis. So the angle between them would be 2 theta, which would be approximately

---------------

 138 degrees. That's one of the options, option C.

But wait, let's check the y-component.

---------------

 The sum of the y-components of the photons' momenta must be zero because the initial total momentum in the y-direction is zero.

So the

---------------

 y-component equation is:

3 m_e c (sin(theta) + sin(phi)) = 0.

Again, if phi = -theta, then sin(phi) = -sin(theta), so sin

---------------

(theta) + sin(phi) = 0, which satisfies the equation.

So that's consistent. So the assumption that the photons are symmetric about

---------------

 the x-axis seems valid.

So theta is arccos(0.35666). Let me calculate that more

---------------

 accurately.

Compute arccos(0.35666):

cos(60°) is 0.5, cos(70°) is about 0.3420. So

---------------

 0.3566 is between 69 and 70 degrees.

Wait, let me compute it.

---------------

 Let's think in terms of calculator steps. Let me use a calculator.

Wait, 0.35666 is

---------------

 the value.

Using a calculator: arccos(0.35666) is approximately 69 degrees.



---------------

So 69 degrees each from the x-axis, one above, one below.

So the angle between the two photons is 69 +69=138 degrees, which is option C.

So

---------------

 the answer is C) 138.


To solve the problem, we analyze the collision of an electron and a positron, which annihilate into two photons. The electron moves to the right with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron moves to the left with a Lorentz factor of 2. The photons produced have equal energies and move in directions symmetric about the x-axis, one upper-right and the other lower-right. The goal is to determine the angle between the directions of the photons.

### Step 1: Relativistic Energy and Momentum
The total energy before the collision is the sum of the relativistic energies of the electron and positron:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.
\]
After the collision, this energy is converted into the energy of two photons, each with energy:
\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{2} = 3 m_e c^2.
\]

The momentum of each photon is:
\[
p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = \frac{3 m_e c^2}{c} = 3 m_e c.
\]

### Step 2: Conservation of Momentum
The total momentum before the collision is the sum of the momenta of the electron and positron. Using the relativistic momentum formula \( p = \gamma m_e v \) and the relationship \( v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \), the momenta are:
\[
p_e = \gamma_e m_e c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_e^2}} = 4 m_e c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{16}} = 4 m_e c \sqrt{\frac{15}{16}} = m_e c \sqrt{15},
\]
\[
p_p = \gamma_p m_e c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_p^2}} = 2 m_e c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4}} = 2 m_e c \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = m_e c \sqrt{3}.
\]
Since the positron moves to the left, its momentum is negative:
\[
p_{\text{initial}} = p_e - p_p = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
\]

After the collision, the photons carry the total momentum. Let the angles of the photons above and below the x-axis be \(\theta\). The momentum components of the photons are:
\[
p_1 = 3 m_e c (\cos\theta, \sin\theta), \quad p_2 = 3 m_e c (\cos\theta, -\sin\theta).
\]
The total momentum after the collision is:
\[
p_{\text{total}} = p_1 + p_2 = (6 m_e c \cos\theta, 0).
\]
Equating the total momentum before and after the collision:
\[
6 m_e c \cos\theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
\]
Dividing through by \( m_e c \):
\[
6 \cos\theta = \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}.
\]
Approx

---------------

imating \(\sqrt{15} \approx 3.872\) and \(\sqrt{3} \approx 1.732\):
\[
6 \cos\theta \approx 3.872 - 1.732 = 2.140,
\]
\[
\cos\theta \approx \frac{2.140}{6} \approx 0.3567.
\]
Thus:
\[
\theta \approx \arccos(0.3567) \approx 69^\circ.
\]

### Step 3: Angle Between the Photons
The two photons are symmetric about the x-axis, one at \(+\theta\) and the other at \(-\theta\). The angle between them is:
\[
\text{Angle} = \theta + \theta = 2\theta \approx 2 \times 69^\circ = 138^\circ.
\]

### Final Answer:
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
