Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about binary star systems. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully

---------------

.

So, there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipsing binaries, meaning their stars pass in front of each other from our point of view, causing eclipses. The periods between two primary eclipses are 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2.

The

---------------

 problem gives me radial velocity (RV) amplitudes. For system_1, the stars have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, they're 15 and 10 km/s. I need to find by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass of each system is the sum of the two stars' masses.

Wait, I

---------------

 remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocity curves are related to the masses of the stars. The more massive star would

---------------

 have a smaller velocity amplitude because it's moving less due to the gravitational pull. Oh right, the mass is inversely proportional to the velocity amplitude since

---------------

 they're orbiting a common center of mass.

So the formula I think I need is something like M1/M2 = (V2)/(V1), where M1 and M2 are the masses of the two stars, and V1 and V2 their velocities. Or

---------------

 wait, actually, I think the mass ratio is (V2/V1), because the more massive star has a smaller velocity.

But

---------------

 wait, in a binary system, the mass ratio q is m2/m1. And the velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses. So if

---------------

 star A has velocity vA and star B has velocity vB, then mA/mB = vB/vA. Because

---------------

 m1*v1 = m2*v2 (since they orbit the same center of mass, their momentum must be equal).

---------------

 So yes, m1/m2 = v2/v1.

So for each system, I can find the mass ratio of

---------------

 the two stars. Then sum the masses for each system and compare.

Wait, but the problem gives the total mass of each system,

---------------

 right? Because the question is about the total mass. So I need to find the sum of the masses in system_1 and system_2 and then

---------------

 find the ratio.

But how do I find the masses using the given data?

Wait, another approach. The period is the same for both stars in a binary system because they orbit each other. So

---------------

 for each system, the period P is given. For system_1, P=2 years, system_2, P=1 year.

The

---------------

 radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given for each star. For system_1, K1 is 10 km/s, K2 is 5 km/s. So the

---------------

 two stars have velocities of 10 and 5 km/s.

In binary stars, the relation between the velocities and masses is given

---------------

 by the mass function. But I think the mass function is for when you don't know the inclination. But in this case, since we

---------------

're given the RV amplitudes, maybe we can assume that the orbits are edge-on, so the inclination is 90 degrees, making

---------------

 the RV amplitudes equal to the actual velocities (since sin(90) is 1). Or wait, maybe

---------------

 the RV amplitude is K = v * sin(i), but if the system is eclipsing, the inclination must be close to 90 degrees, so sin(i) ≈ 1. So I

---------------

 can take K as the actual velocity.

So for each system, the sum of the velocities is v1 + v2 = K1 + K2.



---------------

Wait, but the masses are related to the velocities. So for system_1:

v1 = 10 km/s, v2 =5 km/s.

The

---------------

 mass ratio is m1/m2 = v2/v1 = 5/10 = 0.5. So m1 = 0.5 * m2.

The

---------------

 total mass M1 = m1 + m2 = 0.5 m2 + m2 = 1.5 m2.

Similarly

---------------

 for system_2: K1 is 15, K2 is 10. So v1=15, v2=10.

Mass ratio m1/m2 = v2/v1 = 10/15 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667.

Total mass M2 = m1 + m2 = (2/3 m2) + m2 = (5/3) m2.

Wait, wait

---------------

, no. Wait, I think I got that wrong. Let me recheck.

Wait, the mass ratio q = m2/m1 = v1/v2. Because

---------------

 m1 v1 = m2 v2. So m2/m1 = v1/v2.

Wait, let me get

---------------

 this straight. The center of mass requires m1 * a1 = m2 * a2, where a is the orbital radius. Since

---------------

 the orbital period is the same, the velocities v are proportional to a (v = 2πa/P). So m1 * (v1) = m2 * v2.

So

---------------

, m1/m2 = v2/v1.

Alternatively, m2/m1 = v1/v2.

So for

---------------

 system_1:

v1=10, v2=5. So m2/m1 = 10/5=2. So m2 = 2 m1.

Total

---------------

 mass M1 = m1 + m2 = m1 + 2 m1 = 3 m1.

Similarly, system_2: v1=15, v2=10.

So m2/m1 = 15/10 = 3/2.

---------------

 So m2 = (3/2) m1.

Total mass M2 = m1 + (3/2 m1) = (5/2) m1.

Wait, but wait

---------------

, in system_2, are the velocities from the same stars? Or is it that each system has two stars, each

---------------

 with their own velocities.

Wait, let's clarify. For system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 and 5 km/s. So star

---------------

 A has K1=10, star B has K2=5. So in terms of velocities, vA = 10, vB=5.

Similarly

---------------

, system_2's stars have K1=15, K2=10. So vA=15, vB=10.

Wait

---------------

, but in the mass ratio, it's about the mass of each star in the system. So in system_1, the

---------------

 mass of star A is m1, and star B is m2.

So for system_1:

m1/m2 = vB / vA = 5/10 = 0.5 →

---------------

 m1 = 0.5 m2.

So m2 = 2 m1.

Total mass M1 = m1 + m2 = 3 m1.

Similarly

---------------

, system_2:

vA=15, vB=10.

m1/m2 = vB/vA =10/15=2/3 → m1 = (2/3) m2.

So

---------------

 M2 = m1 + m2 = (2/3 m2) + m2 = (5/3) m2.

Wait, but I

---------------

'm comparing the total masses of each system. So M1 is 3 m1, and M2 is (5/3) m2.

---------------

 But m2 in system_1 is 2 m1, so maybe I can express both in terms of m1.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I should find the total mass of each system in terms of their own parameters, then find the ratio.

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps I can relate the total mass of each system to their velocity amplitudes and the period.

Wait, I recall

---------------

 that the total mass of a binary system can be found using the formula derived from Kepler's third law. The formula is:

M1 + M2 = ( (4

---------------

 π²) / (G P²) ) * (a1 + a2)^3 ) / (1 + (m2/m1)) )

Wait, but

---------------

 that's getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, I remember that for a binary system, the mass function relates the observed velocities and the period to the masses. The mass function is:

f(M) = ( (K1^3 P) ) / (241 * (1 + q)^2 )

where

---------------

 q is the mass ratio m2/m1.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's the right approach because it

---------------

 might require knowing the inclination. But since the systems are eclipsing, their inclination is close to 90 degrees, so sin i is approximately

---------------

 1. So the mass function would give the true mass ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the mass ratio for each system and then find

---------------

 the total mass.

Wait, let's try to model each system.

For system_1:

Star A: K1 = 10 km/s.



---------------

Star B: K2 = 5 km/s.

The period is P1 = 2 years.

The velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses. So m

---------------

_A/m_B = K_B/K_A =5/10=0.5 → m_A =0.5 m_B.

So m

---------------

_A =0.5 m_B.

Total mass M1 = m_A + m_B = 0.5 m_B + m_B = 1.5 m_B.

Similarly

---------------

, for system_2:

Star A: K1=15, Star B: K2=10.

So

---------------

 m_A/m_B = K_B/K_A =10/15=2/3.

So m_A = (2/3) m_B.

Total mass M2 = m_A + m_B = (2/3 m_B) + m_B = (5/3 m_B).

Wait, but I

---------------

 think I'm getting confused here because in system_2, the stars have different velocities. Wait, no—each system has two stars, each with their own velocities.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I should express each system's total mass in terms of their respective velocities and periods.

Wait, another approach: the mass of the binary system can be found

---------------

 using the formula:

M = (4 π² / G) * (a1 + a2)^3 / P²



---------------

But I don't know the semi-major axes a1 and a2. But I know that a1/a2 = m2/m1.



---------------

Because m1 a1 = m2 a2.

So a1 = (m2/m1) a2.

And

---------------

 a1 + a2 = a_total, the separation between the stars.

Alternatively, since the period is the same for both stars, the

---------------

 velocity is v = 2 π a / P.

So for star A: vA = 2 π a1 / P.

Star B: vB = 2 π a2 / P.

From

---------------

 this, a1 = (vA P) / (2 π), and a2 = (vB P)/(2 π).

So a1 + a2 = (vA + vB) P/(2 π).

So

---------------

 the separation a = (vA + vB) P/(2 π).

Then, using Kepler's third law:

(M1 + M2) = (4 π² a^3) / (G P²).

Substituting a from

---------------

 above:

a = (vA + vB) P/(2 π).

So a^3 = [ (vA + vB) P/(2 π) ]^3.

Putting

---------------

 it into Kepler's equation:

M_total = [4 π² * ( (vA + vB) P/(2 π) )^3 ] / (G P² )

Simplify this

---------------

:

Let me compute the numerator:

4 π² * ( (vA + vB) P/(2 π) )^3



---------------

=4 π² * ( (vA + vB)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π^3 )

= [4 π² * (vA + vB)^3 P^3 ] / (8 π^3 )

= [ (4/8) (vA + vB)^3 P^3 ) π² ] / π^3

= [ (0.5) (vA + vB)^3 P^3 ) ] / π.

Then

---------------

, the denominator is G P².

So M_total = [0.5 (vA + vB)^3 P^3 / π ] / (G P² )

= [0.5 (vA + vB)^3 P ] / ( π G )

So

---------------

,

M_total = ( (vA + vB)^3 P ) / ( 2 π G )

Hmm, that

---------------

's the formula for the total mass of the binary system in terms of their velocities and the period.

Wait, but I'm

---------------

 not sure if I did the algebra correctly. Let me check:

a = (vA + vB) P/(2 π)

---------------

 ? No, wait. Because a1 + a2 is the separation, which is a. And a1 = (vA P)/(2 π), a2 = (vB P)/(2 π). So a = a1 + a2 = (vA + vB) P/(2 π). So

---------------

 yes.

So, the formula for M_total is (4 π² a^3)/(G P²).

Substituting a =

---------------

 (vA + vB) P/(2 π):

M_total = [4 π² * ( (vA + vB) P/(2 π) )^3 ] / ( G P² )

Exp

---------------

anding the cube:

= [4 π² * ( (vA + vB)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π^3) ) ] / ( G P² )

Simplify numerator:

4 π² * (vA + vB)^3 P^3 / (8 π^3 )

= (4 /8 ) * (vA + vB)^3 P^3 * π² / π^3

= (0.5) * (vA + vB)^3 P^3 / π

So the

---------------

 numerator is (0.5 (vA + vB)^3 P^3 ) / π.

Divided by denominator G P²:

M

---------------

_total = [0.5 (vA + vB)^3 P^3 / π ] / ( G P² )

= 0.5 (vA + vB)^3 P / ( π G )

So

---------------

 M_total = [ (vA + vB)^3 * P ] / ( 2 π G )

But wait, I

---------------

 think I'm missing a factor. Let me try to calculate this again.

Wait, perhaps I should express it in terms of solar

---------------

 masses and other units to make it easier.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for the mass function. The mass function is:

f(M) = ( (K^3 P) ) / (2.15e5 )

where

---------------

 K is in km/s, P in years, and f(M) is in solar masses.

Wait, that formula might be easier

---------------

. The mass function is defined as:

f(M) = ( (K1^3 P ) / (241) ) / (1 + q)^2,



---------------

where q is the mass ratio m2/m1.

But for an edge-on orbit (i=90 degrees), the mass function equals

---------------

 the true mass function, and when the system is eclipsing, it's likely edge-on, so sin i =1.

Wait

---------------

, but the mass function gives a lower limit on the mass. Hmm, but if the system is eclipsing, that means

---------------

 the inclination is close to 90 degrees, so the mass function gives the actual mass ratio. So perhaps I can use

---------------

 the mass function to find the mass.

Wait, the mass function is given by:

f(M) = ( (K^

---------------

3 P ) ) / (2.15e5 )

where K is the semi-amplitude in km/s, P is the period in years.

But

---------------

 wait, the mass function is f(M) = (m2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (m1 + m2)^2 (1 + m2/m1) ) )

But

---------------

 for i=90, sin i=1, so f(M) = (m2^3 ) / ( (m1 + m2)^2 (1 + m2/m1) ) )

Wait

---------------

, maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps for each system, I can compute the total mass using the formula I

---------------

 derived earlier.

So, for system_1:

vA =10 km/s, vB=5 km/s. Sum is

---------------

 15 km/s.

P1=2 years.

So M1 = [ (15)^3 * 2 ] / (2 π G )

Wait, but I

---------------

 need to compute this in terms of solar masses. Let me think about the units.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute

---------------

 the ratio of the masses between system_1 and system_2.

Because the question asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, I

---------------

 can compute M1/M2.

Let me compute M1 and M2 using the formula M = ( (vA + vB)^3 * P ) / (2 π G )

But wait

---------------

, G is in m^3 kg^-1 s^-2. But perhaps it's easier to work in units where G and other constants are accounted

---------------

 for.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the ratio M1/M2. Let's see:

M1 = ( (v1A

---------------

 + v1B)^3 * P1 ) / (2 π G )

M2 = ( (v2A + v2B)^3 * P2 ) / (2 π G )

So the ratio M1/M2 = [ (v1A + v1B)^3 P1 ] / [ (v2A + v2B)^3 P2 ]

Because the denominator

---------------

 (2 π G ) cancels out.

So substituting the numbers:

v1A + v1B =10 +5 =15 km/s.

v2A +v2B=15+10=25 km/s.

P1=2 years, P2=1 year.

So M1/M2 = [ (15)^3 * 2 ] / [ (25)^3 * 1 ]

Let me compute this

---------------

.

15^3 = 3375.

25^3=15625.

So numerator

---------------

: 3375 *2 = 6750.

Denominator: 15625 *1 =15625.

So ratio =

---------------

 6750 / 15625 = let's compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 270 / 625.

Hmm

---------------

, 270 divided by 625. Let me compute that.

270 ÷ 625 = 0.432.

So M1/M2 �

---------------

� 0.432.

Wait, but the question asks by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So if

---------------

 M1 is 0.432 times M2, then system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So

---------------

 system_2 is more massive.

Wait, but wait a second. The question is phrased as "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" If

---------------

 M1 is 0.43 times M2, then system_1 is 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive.

---------------

 So the factor is about 0.4, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation.

1

---------------

5^3 =3375.

25^3=15625.

So (15^3 *

---------------

2) = 3375 *2=6750.

(25^3 *1)=15625.

6750 /15625 = (

---------------

6750 ÷ 15625) = 0.432.

So M1 is 0.432 times M2. So system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive than

---------------

 system_2 by a factor of about 0.43.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.4 and option B is ~0.6. So 0.43 is closer to 0.4,

---------------

 so the answer would be A.

Wait, but wait another moment. Did I make a mistake in the formula for M_total?

Because

---------------

 in the formula I used, M_total is proportional to (vA + vB)^3 * P.

But I'm

---------------

 not certain if that's correct. Let me think again.

Earlier, I derived:

M_total = [ (vA + vB)^3 * P ] / (2 π G )

But I

---------------

'm not sure if I accounted for all the units correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the formula I should be using is:

M_total = (4 π² a

---------------

^3) / (G P² )

But a is the separation, which is (vA + vB) P/(2 π),

---------------

 as before.

So a = (vA + vB) P/(2 π).

So a^3 = [ (vA + vB) P/(2 π) ]^3 = (vA + vB)^3 P^3 / (8 π^3 )

So

---------------

 M_total = (4 π² * (vA + vB)^3 P^3 / 8 π^3 ) ) / ( G P² )

Simplify numerator:

4 π² * (vA + vB)^3 P^3 / (8 π^3 )

= [4/(8)] * (vA + vB)^3 P^3 π^2 / π^3

= 0.5 (vA + vB)^3 P^3 / π.

Den

---------------

ominator: G P^2.

So M_total = (0.5 (vA + vB)^3 P^3 / π ) / ( G P^2 )

= (0.5 (vA + vB)^3 P ) / ( π G )

So

---------------

 M_total is indeed proportional to (vA + vB)^3 * P.

Thus, the ratio M1/M2 is

---------------

 [ (v1A +v1B)^3 * P1 ] / [ (v2A +v2B)^3 * P2 ]

Which is

---------------

 [15^3 *2 ]/[25^3 *1] = (3375 *2)/(15625) = 6750/15625 = 0.432.

So system

---------------

_1 is 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is about 0.4 times more massive than system_2.

---------------

 But wait, no, because 0.43 is less than 1. So system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of approximately

---------------

 0.43.

So the factor by which system_1 is more massive is 0.43, which is approximately

---------------

 0.4. So the correct option is A.


To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data using the relationship between radial velocity amplitudes and stellar masses. In binary systems, the masses of the stars are inversely proportional to their radial velocity amplitudes, as they orbit a common center of mass. The total mass of a binary system can be expressed as:

\[
M_{\text{total}} \propto (v_A + v_B)^3 \cdot P
\]

where \(v_A\) and \(v_B\) are the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars, and \(P\) is the orbital period.

### System_1:
- Radial velocity amplitudes: \(v_A = 10 \, \text{km/s}, v_B = 5 \, \text{km/s}\)
- Total velocity: \(v_A + v_B = 15 \, \text{km/s}\)
- Orbital period: \(P_1 = 2 \, \text{years}\)

### System_2:
- Radial velocity amplitudes: \(v_A = 15 \, \text{km/s}, v_B = 10 \, \text{km/s}\)
- Total velocity: \(v_A + v_B = 25 \, \text{km/s}\)
- Orbital period: \(P_2 = 1 \, \text{year}\)

The ratio of the total masses is given by:

\[
\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{(v_{A1} + v_{B1})^3 \cdot P_1}{(v_{A2} + v_{B2})^3 \cdot P_2}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{(15)^3 \cdot 2}{(25)^3 \cdot 1}
\]

###

---------------

 Calculations:
1. \(15^3 = 3375\)
2. \(25^3 = 15625\)
3. Numerator: \(3375 \cdot 2 = 6750\)
4. Denominator: \(15625 \cdot 1 = 15625\)
5. Ratio: \(\frac{6750}{15625} = 0.432\)

Thus, system_1 is approximately \(0.432\) times as massive as system_2. Since

---------------

 the question asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, the answer is approximately \(0.4\).

### Conclusion:
System_1 is about \(0.4\) times as massive as system_2. Therefore, the correct answer is:
