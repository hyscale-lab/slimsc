Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. I remember that particles

---------------

 like mesons can decay into other particles, and the mean decay distance is how far they travel before decaying on average.

The given data is

---------------

:
- Production energy E_X = 8 GeV
- Mass m_X = 1.2 GeV
- Width Γ_X = 320 MeV

Wait, the

---------------

 width is given in MeV, and the others are in GeV. I should probably convert them all to the same unit to avoid confusion. Let

---------------

's see, 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So, what's the formula for the mean decay distance? I think it's related to the particle's lifetime. The

---------------

 mean lifetime τ is connected to the decay width Γ by τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, wait, no,

---------------

 I think Γ is the total decay width, and the lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ. But ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Right

---------------

.

Once I have the lifetime τ, the mean decay distance would be the speed of the particle multiplied by τ, right? So distance

---------------

 d = v * τ. But wait, the particle's speed depends on its energy and mass. Since E is much larger than m, perhaps

---------------

 we can approximate it as being relativistic, so v is approximately c.

But wait, E is the production energy, which I

---------------

 suppose is the energy of the meson. So we can find the velocity from E. But I'm a bit confused about

---------------

 how to relate E to v. For a relativistic particle, E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. And

---------------

 γ is also equal to 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)). But maybe there's a simpler way to

---------------

 find v in terms of E and m.

Alternatively, the momentum p can be found using E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Then

---------------

, p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c. And since momentum p is also equal to γ m v, so

---------------

 v = p c²/(E). Hmm, let me think. Wait, maybe I should just calculate the velocity as v = c * sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²))

---------------

.

Wait, because for a relativistic particle, when E is much larger than m c², v is approximately c. Let

---------------

 me see: if E is 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV, then E is about 6.666 times m. So

---------------

 not extremely high, but still relativistic. So perhaps v is close to c, but I should calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps the mean decay length can be approximated using the formula d = (c * τ) * β γ, where β is v/c and γ is the Lorentz factor. Hmm

---------------

, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Calculate the lifetime

---------------

 τ using Γ. τ = ħ / Γ.
2. Find the velocity v of the meson using its energy E and mass m.
3. Compute the mean decay distance as d = v * τ.

Wait, but

---------------

 wait. I think the decay length is given by L = c * τ * β γ, where β is v/c and γ is 1/sqrt(1 - β²). So

---------------

 that's another approach.

Alternatively, since E = γ m c², and p = γ m v = γ m (β c) = β γ m c. So

---------------

 p = β γ m c. Then, since E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2, so

---------------

 (E/(c²))² = (p)^2 + m² c². Hmm, maybe that's a det

---------------

our.

Let me try to compute β and γ first.

Given E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV/c

---------------

². So E = γ m c². So γ = E/(m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ) =

---------------

 6.666... So γ is about 6.6667.

But wait, I think E

---------------

 is in GeV, and m is in GeV/c², so when we write E = γ m c², the

---------------

 units should match. But in natural units, c=1, so E = γ m. So E (in GeV) = γ * m (in GeV). So γ

---------------

 is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666..., which is 20/3.

So

---------------

 γ = 20/3 ≈6.6667.

Then, γ = 1/ sqrt(1 - β²)

---------------

 → β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)). Let's compute that.

1/γ² is (3/20)^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So

---------------

 sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So β ≈ 0.9887.



---------------

So v ≈ 0.9887 c.

Now, τ is the lifetime. The decay width Γ is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But

---------------

 wait, units are a bit tricky. ħ is in J·s. Γ is in GeV. So I need to convert units

---------------

 appropriately.

Let me recall that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm (femto meters). Because

---------------

 1 fm is 1e-15 meters. So 197.33 MeV·fm is equal

---------------

 to ħ c.

So, ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / c. Wait

---------------

, because ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm, so ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c. But

---------------

 c is in units of fm per second? Wait, I might be mixing units here.

Alternatively, let's compute τ.

Γ

---------------

 is given as 320 MeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ. Let's compute this.

ħ =

---------------

 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and 

---------------

1 eV·s is 1e-18 J·s. Hmm, but I think the commonly used value is ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

So τ

---------------

 = ħ / Γ. So Γ is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) ) → 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait

---------------

, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately 2.056e-24 seconds.

Wait

---------------

, but wait, I think I should double-check the value of ħ in GeV·s. Let me recall:

---------------

 ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Yes, that's correct.

So τ

---------------

 ≈ 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let's calculate that.

6.582e-25 / 0.32 →

---------------

 6.582 / 0.32 = approximately 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s

---------------

 = 2.056875e-24 s.

Now, the decay distance is d = v * τ.

v is approximately 0.9887 c, so

---------------

 let's take v ≈ c for approximation, but since it's close, maybe we need to use the exact value. Let

---------------

's compute it more accurately.

But let's proceed step by step.

v = β c = 0.9887 c.

So d = v * τ = β c * τ.

We

---------------

 have β ≈ 0.9887, c = 3e8 m/s, τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

So d

---------------

 = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute

---------------

 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 → 3 * 2.056875 = 6.170625 → 6.170625e-16 meters.

Then multiply by 0.9887: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ approximately

---------------

 6.108e-16 m.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see that

---------------

. The options are around 4e-15 or 5e-15, or similar.

Hmm, that

---------------

's way smaller than the options given. So I must have made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation

---------------

 of tau. Let me check again.

Wait, τ = ħ / Γ → ħ in GeV·s is 6.582e-25, Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So 6.582e-25 / 0.32 → let

---------------

 me compute that again.

6.582e-25 / 0.32 → 6.582 / 0.32 = 

---------------

20.56875 → so 20.56875e-25 s → which is 2.056875e-24 s.

Hmm

---------------

, that seems right. Then, decay length is v * τ.

v is 0.9887 c →

---------------

 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = approx 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply

---------------

 by τ: 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

So

---------------

 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = let's compute 

---------------

2.966 * 2.056875 ≈ 6.109, then

---------------

 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16. So 6.109e-16 m.

But

---------------

 the options are around 4e-15 and 5e-15, which are about ten times larger. So

---------------

 why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let me re-calculate beta and gamma.

E

---------------

 = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV.

So E = gamma m c². So gamma = E / (m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) )= 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667

---------------

.

Gamma is 6.6667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) → 1/gamma² is (1/6.6667)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775 → sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta is correct

---------------

.

Wait, but perhaps I should use the exact expression for the mean decay length.

The mean decay length L is given by L = (c * tau) * beta gamma.

Wait, because

---------------

 tau is the proper lifetime, and the lab frame observes the lifetime as gamma tau. So L = v * gamma tau.



---------------

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. So the mean decay length is v

---------------

 * gamma tau.

But wait, tau is the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame). So in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau. So the distance

---------------

 is v multiplied by gamma tau.

So L = v * gamma tau.

Wait, but that's different from what I did before. I

---------------

 think I made a mistake earlier by not considering gamma in the decay length.

So let's recalculate.

So, L = v * gamma tau.

We

---------------

 have v = beta c, gamma is 6.6667, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So,

---------------

 L = beta c gamma tau.

So, beta is 0.9887, gamma is 6.6667.

So

---------------

 beta * gamma is 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.5913.

So

---------------

 L = 6.5913 * c * tau.

c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So,

---------------

 L = 6.5913 * (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s).

Compute

---------------

 the numbers:

3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by 6.5913: 6.170625e-16 * 6.5913 ≈ 

---------------

40.73e-16 m.

Which is 4.073e-15 m.

Ah

---------------

, that's about 4.07e-15 meters, which is option B (4.0655e-15 m) or option D (4.0655e-16 m).

---------------

 Wait, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is close to this value.

So the

---------------

 correct answer should be option B.

But wait, let's do the exact calculation for beta * gamma.

beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666667

---------------

.

So 1/gamma^2 = (1/6.6666667)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.98872

---------------

.

So beta * gamma = 0.98872 * 6.6666667.

Let

---------------

 me compute 0.98872 * 6.6666667:

0.98872 * 6 = 5.93232



---------------

0.98872 * 0.6666667 ≈ 0.98872 * 2/3 ≈ 0.659147.

So total is approximately

---------------

 5.93232 + 0.659147 ≈ 6.591467.

So beta

---------------

 gamma ≈6.591467.

So L = beta gamma c tau.

c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L

---------------

 = 6.591467 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Calcul

---------------

ating 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by 6.591467: 6.170625e-16 * 6.591467 ≈ ?



---------------

6 * 6.170625e-16 = 3.702375e-15

0.591467 *6.170625e-16 �

---------------

� approx 3.646e-16.

Wait, wait, perhaps a better way: 6.591467 *

---------------

 6.170625e-16 = ?

Let me compute 6 * 6.170625e-16 = 3.702375e-15.

0.591467 *6.170625e-16 =

---------------

 let's compute 6.170625 *0.591467 ≈ approx 3.658

---------------

e-16.

Wait, 6.170625 *0.591467 →

---------------

 6 *0.591467 is about 3.5488, and 0.170625 *0.591467 ≈ 

---------------

0.1009, so total ≈3.6497.

So 3.6497e-16.

So total

---------------

 L ≈ 3.702375e-15 + 3.6497e-16 = 

---------------

4.067345e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.067e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.

So the correct answer is B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the following data:

- Production energy: \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Mass: \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \)
- Decay width: \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \)

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
The relation between \( \beta \) and \( \gamma \) is:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the lifetime \( \tau \)
The lifetime is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \) and \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
The mean decay distance is given by:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

Here:
- \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \),
- \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \tau \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \).

First, calculate \( \beta \gamma \):

\[
\beta \gamma = 0.9887 \times 6.6667 \approx 6.5914
\]

Now, calculate \( L \):

\[
L = 6.5914 \times (3 \times 10^8) \times (2.056875 \times 10^{-24})
\]

\[
L \approx 6.5914 \times 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the options
The calculated mean decay distance \( L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) matches closely with option **B** (\( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)).
