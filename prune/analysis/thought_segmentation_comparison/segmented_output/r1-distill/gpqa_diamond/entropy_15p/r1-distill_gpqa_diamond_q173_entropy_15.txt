Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Oh

---------------

 wait, and the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. Interesting.

So, the nucleus

---------------

 is initially at rest, which means the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. So

---------------

 their momenta should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1, and the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. So

---------------

 I need to calculate both and find the difference.

Let me jot down the given data:

- Initial rest mass energy: 300 GeV.

---------------

 So M c² = 300 GeV.

After fission:
- Let the two masses be m1 and m2. Given

---------------

 that m1 = 2 m2. So m1 = 2m2.
- Sum of rest masses: m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Because

---------------

 it's 99% of M.

Wait, so substituting m1 = 2 m2 into the sum equation

---------------

:

2 m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = (0.99/3) M = 0.33 M.

---------------

 So m1 is 2/3 M? Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, 0.99 M is

---------------

 the sum, so 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = (0.99/3) M = 0.33 M. So m1 is 2 *

---------------

 0.33 M = 0.66 M. Hmm, but 0.66 + 0.33 is 0.99, correct

---------------

.

So, the two fragments have rest masses 0.66 M and 0.33 M. But wait, the

---------------

 initial nucleus is M, so the rest mass has decreased by 1% (because 0.99 M is 99% of M). So the

---------------

 mass deficit is 0.01 M, which must be converted into kinetic energy and any binding energy or other forms, but the

---------------

 problem says to ignore electrons, so probably we can consider that all the mass deficit goes into kinetic energy of the two fragments.

But wait, in

---------------

 reality, some energy is released as kinetic, but the problem states that the sum of rest masses is 99% of M. So the

---------------

 rest mass energy after fission is 0.99 * M c², which is 297 GeV. The initial rest mass energy was 300 GeV. So the energy released is 3 GeV, which is

---------------

 the total kinetic energy plus any binding energy, but since the problem says to ignore electrons and nothing else is produced, perhaps all

---------------

 the released energy goes into kinetic energy.

So, the total kinetic energy (K_total) of the two fragments is 3 GeV.

---------------

 Because 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.

Now, since the nucleus

---------------

 was at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta.

Let me denote the velocities of

---------------

 the two fragments as v1 and v2. Since momentum is conserved, m1 v1 = m2 v2 (

---------------

but in opposite directions, so maybe I should take magnitudes here). Wait, but directionally, they must be opposite, so the

---------------

 momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So, m1 v1 = m2 v2. Because momentum

---------------

 is conserved, so the product m v for each should be equal in magnitude.

Since m1 = 2 m2, so

---------------

 2 m2 v1 = m2 v2 → 2 v1 = v2. So the lighter fragment moves

---------------

 twice as fast as the heavier one.

Now, the kinetic energy of each fragment is (1/2) m v².

---------------

 So let's compute their kinetic energies.

But wait, wait a second. The problem is that in reality, for high speeds (like

---------------

 in nuclear reactions), relativistic effects are significant. So the kinetic energies would be calculated using relativistic mechanics. But the question also asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. So I need to compute both.



---------------

Let me plan this out:

1. Calculate the speeds of the two fragments using conservation of momentum and energy.

2. Compute

---------------

 the relativistic kinetic energies of each fragment.

3. Compute the non-relativistic kinetic energies (classical approximation).

4. Find the difference between the relativistic and classical values for the more massive fragment (T1 is

---------------

 the kinetic energy of the more massive one).

Wait, but perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me think about it.

Alternatively

---------------

, I can model this as a two-body problem in relativity, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, since the problem

---------------

 is about the difference between relativistic and non-relativistic approaches, maybe the velocities are high enough that the difference is non-negligible.

But

---------------

 maybe for this problem, the velocities are not extremely high, so the non-relativistic approximation is a decent starting point, but the

---------------

 exact answer requires relativistic calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the center-of-momentum frame.

Wait, but

---------------

 the initial nucleus is at rest, so the center-of-momentum frame is the same as the rest frame of the nucleus. After fission, the two fragments move in opposite directions with

---------------

 velocities such that their momenta cancel out.

Wait, so the total momentum is zero, so each fragment's momentum is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So, the

---------------

 momentum of the first fragment (m1) is p = m1 v1 (relativistic momentum is gamma m v, but wait

---------------

, in non-relativistic, it's m v. Hmm, so maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.)

Wait, let

---------------

's try to model this correctly.

In the center-of-momentum frame (which is the initial rest frame of the nucleus), the two fragments move

---------------

 with velocities v1 and v2 in opposite directions, such that their momenta are equal and opposite.

In the non-relativistic case, momentum

---------------

 is m v. So m1 v1 = m2 v2.

But in the relativistic case, momentum is gamma m v. So gamma

---------------

1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Wait, this complicates things, but perhaps for the non

---------------

-relativistic case, we can proceed, and then see the relativistic case.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to calculate

---------------

 the velocities of the two fragments using conservation of momentum and energy.

Let me outline the steps.

First, for the non-relativistic case:

Ass

---------------

ume that kinetic energy is (1/2) m v².

We have:

1. Conservation of momentum: m1 v1 = m2 v2.



---------------

2. Conservation of energy: The initial rest energy is M c². After fission, the rest energies are m1 c² and m2 c², plus the kinetic energies.



---------------

So, M c² = (m1 + m2) c² + K_total.

Wait, but wait, the

---------------

 initial energy is only the rest energy, and after fission, each fragment has their rest energy plus kinetic energy. So:



---------------

M c² = (m1 + m2) c² + K1 + K2.

But from the problem statement, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. So:



---------------

M c² = 0.99 M c² + K1 + K2 → K1 + K2 = 0.01 M c².

Which

---------------

 is 3 GeV, as I thought earlier.

Now, in non-relativistic case, K1 = (1/2) m1 v1², K2 = (1/2) m2 v2².

Using

---------------

 the momentum equation, m1 v1 = m2 v2 → v2 = (m1/m2) v1.

Since

---------------

 m1 = 2 m2, v2 = (2 m2 / m2) v1 = 2 v1.

So,

---------------

 substituting into K2:

K2 = (1/2) m2 (2 v1)^2 = (1/2) m2 (4 v1²) = 2 m2 v1².

Similarly

---------------

, K1 = (1/2) m1 v1² = (1/2)(2 m2) v1² = m2 v1².

So K1 + K2 = m2 v1² + 2 m2 v1² = 3 m2 v1².

But

---------------

 K1 + K2 is 3 GeV, so 3 m2 v1² = 3 GeV.

Wait

---------------

, but m2 is 0.33 M. Hmm, but I'm not sure if I can proceed without knowing M's

---------------

 actual value. Oh wait, but perhaps I can express v in terms of M.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of M and

---------------

 c.

Wait, let's see. Let me consider M as the initial rest mass. So M c² = 300 GeV.

In

---------------

 non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v².

We have K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

But

---------------

 from the earlier substitution, K1 = m2 v1².

Because:

K1 = (1/2) m1 v1² = (1/2)(2 m2) v1² = m2 v1².

So

---------------

, K1 + K2 = m2 v1² + 2 m2 v1² = 3 m2 v1² = 3 GeV.

So,

---------------

 3 m2 v1² = 3 GeV → m2 v1² = 1 GeV.

But

---------------

 m2 is 0.33 M. So 0.33 M v1² = 1 GeV.

Wait

---------------

, but M is in units of mass, and I need to relate it to energy. Maybe I should express M in terms of GeV/c².

So

---------------

, M = (300 GeV) / c².

So m2 = 0.33 M = (0.33 * 300 GeV) / c² = 99 GeV / c².

So,

---------------

 m2 v1² = 1 GeV → (99 GeV/c²) v1² = 1 GeV → v1² = (1 GeV) / (99 GeV/c²) ) =

---------------

 (1/99) c².

So v1 = c * sqrt(1/99) ≈ c * 0.1005.

So

---------------

 v1 is about 10% the speed of light. Hmm, that's already a significant fraction, so relativistic effects may be noticeable.

Now

---------------

, using this, I can compute the non-relativistic kinetic energy, K1_nonrel = m2 v1².

Wait, no

---------------

, K1_nonrel is (1/2) m1 v1². Let's compute that.

m1 = 2 m2 = 2 * 99 GeV/c² = 198 GeV/c².

v1²

---------------

 = (1/99) c².

So K1_nonrel = (1/2) * 198 GeV/c² * (1/99 c²) ) = (1/2) * (198 * 1/99) GeV.



---------------

198 / 99 = 2, so (1/2)*2 GeV = 1 GeV.

Wait

---------------

, that's interesting. So the more massive fragment's kinetic energy in the non-relativistic approximation is 1 GeV. But

---------------

 the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, so the lighter fragment must have 2 GeV in the non-relativistic case.

---------------

 Wait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive because the heavier fragment is less massive, but moving slower.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I made a miscalculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, in non-relativistic case, K1 = (1/2) m1 v1^2.

m

---------------

1 is 198 GeV/c².

v1^2 is (1/99) c².

So:



---------------

K1 = (1/2) * 198 GeV/c² * (1/99 c²) )

---------------

 = (1/2) * (198 /99) GeV = (1/2)*2 GeV = 1 GeV. Yes

---------------

, correct.

Similarly, K2 would be 2 GeV, as I thought earlier.

So, in the non-relativistic case, the more massive fragment has K

---------------

1_nonrel = 1 GeV.

Now, let's compute the relativistic case.

In the relativistic case, the energy of

---------------

 each fragment is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy, so total energy E1 = (m1 c²) γ, where γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v1²/c²).

Similarly

---------------

, E2 = (m2 c²) γ2, where γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v2²/c²).

But also

---------------

, the total energy must be equal to the initial rest energy plus the kinetic energy.

Wait, no. The initial energy is only

---------------

 the rest energy M c². After fission, each fragment has their rest energy plus kinetic energy, so:

M c² = E1 + E2 = (m1 c²) γ1 + (m2 c²) γ2.

And

---------------

 the total momentum is zero, so:

m1 γ1 v1 = m2 γ2 v2.

Because momentum is cons

---------------

erved.

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Let me see if I can find a way to relate γ1 and γ2.

We

---------------

 have m1 v1 = m2 v2 from the non-relativistic case, but in the relativistic case, it

---------------

's (m1 γ1 v1) = (m2 γ2 v2).

Wait, but since in the relativ

---------------

istic case, the velocities are different, perhaps I need to find a relation between v1 and v2.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 I can express v2 in terms of v1 using the momentum equation.

Wait, let me write the momentum equation:

m1 γ1 v1 = m2 γ2 v2.

But

---------------

 from the non-relativistic case, we have m1 v1 = m2 v2 → v2 = (m1/m2) v1.

So

---------------

, substituting into the relativistic momentum equation:

m1 γ1 v1 = m2 γ2 ( (m1/m2) v1 )

Simplify:

m1 γ1 v1 = m1 γ2 v1 → γ1 = γ2.

So

---------------

, the two γ factors are equal. So γ1 = γ2 = γ.

Hmm, that's a useful simplification. So each fragment has the same gamma factor.

So

---------------

, both fragments have the same γ, which simplifies the equations.

Now, the energy equation becomes:

M c² = m1 c² γ + m2 c² γ = (m1 + m2) c² γ.

We

---------------

 know that m1 + m2 = 0.99 M, so:

M c² = 0.99 M c² γ → γ = M c² / (0.99 M c²) ) → γ = 1 / 0.99 ≈ 1.010101.

Wait

---------------

, that's interesting. So the gamma factor is approximately 1.01.

So, γ = 1.01010

---------------

1.

Now, the kinetic energy for each fragment is (γ - 1) m c².

So for the more massive fragment (m1), K

---------------

1_rel = (γ -1) m1 c².

Similarly, K2_rel = (γ -1) m2 c².

So

---------------

, the total kinetic energy is K1_rel + K2_rel = (γ-1)(m1 + m2) c² = (γ-1) * 0.99 M c².

But we

---------------

 know that the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, which is 3 GeV = 0.01 M c².



---------------

So, let me check:

(γ-1) * 0.99 M c² = 0.01 M c² → (γ-1) = (0.01 M c²) / (0.99 M c²) ) → (γ-1) = 0.01 / 0.99 ≈ 0.010101.

So

---------------

 γ = 1.010101, which matches the earlier calculation.

So, the relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m1) is K1_rel = (γ -1) m1 c².

Sub

---------------

stituting the values:

m1 c² = 198 GeV (since m1 = 0.66 M, and M c² = 300 GeV →

---------------

 0.66 * 300 = 198 GeV).

So K1_rel = (0.010101) * 198 GeV ≈ (0.010101) * 198 ≈ approx 2 GeV.

Wait, wait

---------------

, no. Because (0.010101) * 198 = approximately 2 GeV.



---------------

Wait, let me calculate:

0.010101 * 198 = 198 * (1/99) )

---------------

 → because 0.010101 is approximately 1/99.

Wait, 1/99 is approximately 0.010101.

So 198 * (1/99) ) = 2.



---------------

So K1_rel = 2 GeV.

Wait, but earlier in the non-relativistic case, K1_nonrel was 1 GeV.

So the difference between the relativistic and non-relativistic values

---------------

 for T1 (which is K1) would be 2 GeV - 1 GeV = 1 GeV.

But wait, that

---------------

's 1000 MeV. But the options are A) 2 MeV, B)5, C)10, D)20. So

---------------

 this can't be right. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the relativistic calculation.

Wait, let me go

---------------

 back.

In the relativistic case, the gamma is approximately 1.010101, which is very

---------------

 close to 1.

So, the gamma minus 1 is about 0.010101.

So

---------------

, for K1_rel, it's (gamma-1) * m1 c².

m1 c² is 198 GeV, so 

---------------

0.010101 * 198 GeV = approximately 2 GeV.

But wait, the

---------------

 non-relativistic K1 was 1 GeV, so the difference is 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV. But the options don't have anything

---------------

 near that.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculations. Let me recheck.

Wait, the initial rest energy is 300 GeV, and

---------------

 the sum of rest masses is 297 GeV. So the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, which is correct

---------------

.

In the non-relativistic case, the more massive fragment (m1) has K1_nonrel = 1 GeV, and the lighter (m2) has 2 GeV.

In the relativistic case, since

---------------

 both have the same gamma, each fragment's KE is (gamma-1) * m c².

So, K1_rel = (gamma-1)*198 GeV.



---------------

gamma is 1/(0.99) ≈ 1.010101.

So, gamma-1 = 0.010101.

So K1_rel = 0.010101 * 198 GeV ≈ 2 GeV.

So

---------------

, the non-relativistic K1 is 1 GeV, and the relativistic is 2 GeV. So the difference is 1 GeV,

---------------

 which is 1000 MeV. But the options don't have that. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I made a mistake in the assumption that both fragments have the same gamma. Let me double-check that.

From the momentum equation,

---------------

 we have:

m1 γ1 v1 = m2 γ2 v2.

But in the non-relativistic case, m1 v1 = m2 v2 → v2 = (m1/m2) v1.

In

---------------

 the relativistic case, perhaps the velocities are different. So the earlier assumption that γ1 = γ2 might not hold.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I made an error there. Let me re-express the momentum equation.

We have:

m1 γ1 v1 = m2 γ2 v2.

And from the non-relativistic case, v2 = (m1/m2) v1.

So

---------------

 substituting into the momentum equation:

m1 γ1 v1 = m2 γ2 ( (m1/m2) v1 )

Simplify:

m1 γ1 v1 = m1 γ2 v1 → γ1 = γ2.

So yes

---------------

, γ1 = γ2.

So, the earlier assumption holds.

Hmm, so perhaps the error is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I'm miscalculating the relativistic kinetic energy. Because in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c², not

---------------

 (gamma) m c².

Wait, let's recompute.

In the relativistic case:

E1 = gamma * m1 c².



---------------

E2 = gamma * m2 c².

The sum E1 + E2 = gamma (m1 + m2) c² = gamma * 0.99 M c².

But the

---------------

 initial energy is M c², so:

gamma * 0.99 M c² = M c² → gamma = 1 / 0.99 ≈ 1.010101.

So, gamma

---------------

 is 1.010101.

So, the kinetic energy for each fragment is:

K1_rel = (gamma - 1) m1 c² = (0.010101) * 198 GeV ≈ 2 GeV.

Similarly

---------------

, K2_rel = (gamma-1) m2 c² = 0.010101 * 99 GeV ≈ 1 GeV.

So, the

---------------

 total K is 2 + 1 = 3 GeV, which is correct.

So, the non-relativistic K

---------------

1 is 1 GeV, relativistic is 2 GeV.

Wait, but that makes the difference 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV, which is way larger

---------------

 than any of the options given. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that

---------------

 I'm not considering that the fragments' rest masses are less than M, so the binding energy is included, but the problem says to ignore electrons. Hmm

---------------

, maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, let me think again. The initial nucleus has rest mass M, and after fission, the sum

---------------

 of rest masses is 0.99 M, so the mass lost is 0.01 M. So the energy

---------------

 released is (0.01 M c²) which is 3 GeV. So the total kinetic energy of both fragments is 3 GeV.

In the non-relativistic case, the

---------------

 more massive fragment has 1 GeV, the lighter has 2 GeV.

In the relativistic case, the more massive fragment has 2 GeV, the

---------------

 lighter has 1 GeV. So the difference is 1 GeV for T1.

But the options are in MeV, and

---------------

 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the relativ

---------------

istic KE.

Wait, perhaps I should not assume that the kinetic energy is (gamma-1) m c². Wait

---------------

, in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is indeed (gamma - 1) m c². So that part is correct.

Wait

---------------

, perhaps I made a mistake in the non-relativistic calculation. Let me recheck.

In the non-relativistic case, the

---------------

 more massive fragment has K1_nonrel = 1 GeV. So the difference is 2 GeV - 1 GeV = 1 GeV.

---------------

 So the difference is 1000 MeV, which is not among the options. So I must have made a mistake in my

---------------

 approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Let me think: perhaps the problem is not about the difference

---------------

 between relativistic and non-relativistic KE, but the other way around. Wait, the question says, "the difference between the correct T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical approximation."



---------------

So, correct T1 is relativistic, and classical is non-relativistic. So the difference is 2 GeV - 1 GeV = 1 GeV,

---------------

 which is 1000 MeV, but that's not an option.

Hmm, maybe I got the velocities wrong.

---------------

 Let me re-express the velocities.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the actual velocities more accurately.

In the non-relativistic case, we

---------------

 had v1 = c * sqrt(1/99) ≈ 0.1005 c.

In

---------------

 the relativistic case, perhaps the velocities are higher, leading to higher gamma.

Wait, but earlier calculation shows that gamma is only

---------------

 about 1.01, which suggests that the velocities are not extremely high, but perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I should compute the actual velocity using the gamma.

gamma = 1.010101 → 1/gamma = 0.990099.

So, 1 - v²/c² = (1/gamma²) → v²/c² = 1 - (1/ (gamma^2)).

gamma is

---------------

 1.010101 → gamma squared is approximately 1.0203.

So, 1/g

---------------

amma^2 ≈ 0.9806.

So, v²/c² = 1 - 0.9806 = 0.0194 → v = c * sqrt(0.0194) ≈ 0.139 c.

So, v

---------------

1 is about 0.139 c.

Wait, that's higher than the non-relativistic 0.1005 c. So the

---------------

 relativistic velocity is a bit higher than the non-relativistic case, which makes sense.

Now, let's compute the non

---------------

-relativistic K1 and relativistic K1.

Non-rel K1: (1/2) m1 v1^2.

m1 is 198 GeV/c².

v1 is

---------------

 0.139 c, but wait no, in the non-rel case, v1 was 0.1005 c. So

---------------

 let me compute both.

Wait, no, in the non-rel case, v1 was sqrt(1/99) c ≈ 0.1005 c.

In

---------------

 the relativistic case, v1 is 0.139 c.

So, for the non-relativistic K

---------------

1_nonrel, it's (1/2) * 198 GeV/c² * (0.1005 c)^2.

Calcul

---------------

ating:

(0.1005 c)^2 = (0.01010025) c².

So,

K1_nonrel = (1/2) * 198 GeV/c² * 0.01010025 c².



---------------

= (1/2) * 198 * 0.01010025 GeV.

= 99 * 0.01010025 GeV ≈ 1 GeV.

Which matches earlier

---------------

 calculation.

In the relativistic case, K1_rel = (gamma -1) m1 c² = (0.010101) * 198 GeV ≈ 2 GeV.

So the difference is 1 GeV.

But the

---------------

 options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in the relativistic case, the kinetic

---------------

 energy is higher than the non-relativistic case, but the actual difference is small compared to the non-rel value. But

---------------

 in this case, the difference is 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV, but the options are much

---------------

 smaller.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the sum of rest masses is 0.99 M. Let me re

---------------

check.

Problem statement: "The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M." So yes

---------------

, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

So, initial rest energy is 300 GeV.

---------------

 Sum of rest energies is 0.99 * 300 = 297 GeV. So the

---------------

 kinetic energy is 3 GeV, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm computing the difference as (rel - non-rel) =

---------------

 1 GeV, but the options are in MeV, so perhaps I made a mistake in units.

Wait, 

---------------

1 GeV is 1000 MeV. But the options are 2,5,10,20 MeV. So perhaps

---------------

 the correct answer is 20 MeV, but I'm getting 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV. So

---------------

 something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption that gamma is 1.010101. Let me recompute

---------------

 gamma.

M c² = (m1 + m2) c² * gamma → gamma = M c² / ( (m1 + m2) c² ) ) = M / (m1 + m2) ) = 1 / 0.99 → gamma

---------------

 = 1.010101.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is elsewhere. Let me think:

---------------

 perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the difference in the kinetic energies, but perhaps the initial calculation of the non-relativistic case

---------------

 is wrong.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, K1_nonrel = (1/2) m1 v1^2 = 1 GeV.

In the relativistic case, K1_rel = 2 GeV.

So, the difference is 1 GeV,

---------------

 which is 1000 MeV.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I've misunderstood the problem.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the question is not about the difference between the relativistic and non-relativistic T1, but the other way around.

---------------

 No, the question says "the difference between the correct T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation." So correct is relativistic, and

---------------

 the difference is rel - non-rel.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is 20 MeV, which is option D. But according

---------------

 to my calculation, it's 1000 MeV. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should

---------------

 consider that the kinetic energy difference is small because the velocity is not that high. But in this case, gamma is only about 1.01, so the KE

---------------

 in the relativistic case is about 2 GeV, which is 2 times the non-relativistic value. So the difference is 1 GeV.

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps I should compute the exact value of (gamma - 1) m1 c^2 and (1/2 m1 v^2) and

---------------

 find the difference.

Wait, let's compute more accurately.

gamma = 1/0.99 = 1.0101010101...

gamma -1 = 0.0101010101...

So, K1_rel = (0.0101010101) * 198 GeV.

0

---------------

.0101010101 * 198 = ?

Well, 198 * 0.01 = 1.98.

198 * 0.0001010101 ≈ 0.0200000

---------------

002.

So total is approximately 1.98 + 0.02 = 2 GeV.

So

---------------

 K1_rel = 2 GeV.

Non-rel K1 is 1 GeV. So the difference is 1 GeV,

---------------

 which is 1000 MeV. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem is stated differently.

Wait, perhaps I made

---------------

 a mistake in the initial assumption that the entire 3 GeV is the kinetic energy. Because in reality, some energy is

---------------

 released as binding energy or other forms, but the problem says to ignore electrons and nothing else is produced, so I think that

---------------

's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the velocities more accurately and then compute the non-rel and rel KE.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute

---------------

 the velocities relativistically.

Wait, but the problem is getting complicated, and I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look

---------------

 for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the difference is small, so the correct answer is 20 MeV.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I'm using m1 = 0.66 M, but perhaps the actual rest

---------------

 mass is different.

Wait, let me recompute the rest masses.

Problem statement: sum of rest masses is 99% of M →

---------------

 0.99 M.

And one fragment is twice as massive as the other.

So, m1 = 2 m2.

m1 + m2 = 0.99 M → 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.33 M, m1 = 0.66 M.

So, that

---------------

's correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value of (gamma-1) m1 c² and (

---------------

1/2 m1 v²) and find the difference.

In non-relativistic case, K1_nonrel = (1/2) m1 v1² = 1 GeV.

In relativistic case, K1_rel = (gamma-1) m1 c² = 2 GeV.

So difference is 1 GeV.



---------------

But the options don't have that, so perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the kinetic

---------------

 energy is not (gamma-1) m c², but perhaps I'm missing a factor. Or perhaps I should use

---------------

 the relation between energy and momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the velocities using the relativistic equations.

We have:

gamma

---------------

 = 1.010101.

v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

gamma squared

---------------

 is (1.010101)^2 ≈ 1.020303.

So, 1/gamma^2 ≈ 0.9804

---------------

.

So, 1 - 1/gamma^2 ≈ 0.0196.

v = c * sqrt(0.0196) = c * 0.14.

So, v is

---------------

 0.14 c.

In non-relativistic case, v was 0.1005 c.

So, perhaps

---------------

 I can compute the exact relativistic and non-relativistic KEs.

Wait, let me compute the non-rel K1.



---------------

K1_nonrel = (1/2) m1 v^2.

m1 = 0.66 M = 0.66 * (300 GeV / c²) ) = 198 GeV/c².

v = 0.14 c.

So, v² = (0.14)^2 c² = 0.0196 c².

So, K1_nonrel = (1/2) * 198 GeV/c² * 0.0196 c².

= (1/2) * 198 * 0.0196 GeV.

= 99 * 0.0196 GeV ≈ 1.9404 GeV.

Wait, wait

---------------

, this is different from the earlier 1 GeV.

Hmm, earlier calculation of non-rel K1 was 1 GeV, but using

---------------

 v = 0.14 c, it's about 1.94 GeV. That's a contradiction.

Wait, what

---------------

's going on here. Oh, perhaps I confused the velocities in the non-rel and relativistic cases.

In the non-rel case, the

---------------

 velocity is v1 = sqrt( (K1_nonrel * 2) / m1 ), but perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, earlier

---------------

 I found that in the non-rel case, K1_nonrel = 1 GeV. But using v = 0.14 c,

---------------

 which is the relativistic velocity, the non-rel K1 would be higher.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the velocities correctly in each case.

Wait

---------------

, perhaps the non-relativistic case has v1 = sqrt( (2 K1_nonrel) / m1 ), and

---------------

 the relativistic case has a different velocity.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact

---------------

 relativistic and non-rel KE and find the difference.

But given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is option

---------------

 D, 20 MeV.

But according to my earlier calculations, the difference is 1 GeV, which is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in

---------------

 the problem setup.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem asks for the difference between the correct and the non-relativistic value

---------------

, but perhaps the correct value is less than the non-relativistic. That would change the difference.

Wait, but in

---------------

 our case, the relativistic KE is higher than non-rel. So difference is positive.

Wait, perhaps I should re-ex

---------------

press everything in terms of MeV.

1 GeV = 1000 MeV.

So, 1 GeV difference is 1000 MeV, but the options are up

---------------

 to 20 MeV. So I'm off by a factor of 50.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation

---------------

 of m1.

Wait, m1 is 0.66 M. M is 300 GeV/c². So m1 = 0.66 * 300 GeV/c² = 198 GeV/c².

So

---------------

, m1 c² is 198 GeV.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm. Maybe the mistake is that I'm

---------------

 using the wrong expression for relativistic KE.

Wait, the correct relativistic KE is (gamma-1) m c².

Yes

---------------

, that's correct.

So, I'm confident that the relativistic KE is about 2 GeV, and non-rel is 1 GeV. Difference is 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV. But the

---------------

 options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption that the sum of rest masses is 0.99 M. Oh

---------------

 wait, the problem says, "the sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M." So yes

---------------

, 0.99 M.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps the intended answer is option D) 20 MeV, but according to my calculation, it's 1000 MeV. So

---------------

 perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the binding energy or other factors, but the problem says to ignore electrons and nothing else is produced. So I

---------------

 think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the non-relativistic case overestimates the kinetic energy, and

---------------

 the relativistic is lower, but that doesn't fit with the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value of

---------------

 (gamma-1) * m1 c^2 and compare it with the non-rel K1.

Wait, gamma is 1.010101.



---------------

gamma -1 = 0.010101.

So, 0.010101 * 198 GeV = (

---------------

198 * 0.010101) GeV.

198 * 0.01 = 1.98 GeV.

198 * 0.000101 = 

---------------

0.019998 GeV.

Total is approximately 2 GeV.

So, K1_rel = 2 GeV.

Non-rel K1 is 1 GeV.

Difference is 1 GeV,

---------------

 which is 1000 MeV.

But the options are much smaller. So perhaps the intended answer is option D) 20 MeV, but I'm

---------------

 not seeing where I went wrong.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the initial rest mass is 300 GeV, but the

---------------

 sum of rest masses is 99% of the initial mass. So the sum is 297 GeV, but

---------------

 the initial mass is 300 GeV. So the mass defect is 3 GeV, which is the total kinetic energy.

But

---------------

 in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments, but perhaps the distribution is different.

Wait, in

---------------

 the non-rel case, the more massive fragment has K1_nonrel = 1 GeV, and in rel case, K1_rel = 2 GeV. So difference is 1 GeV.

But the

---------------

 options don't have this.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that I'm miscalculating the velocities.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I should compute the exact value of the velocities.

In the non-rel case, v1 = sqrt( (2 K1_nonrel) / m1 ) )

---------------

 = sqrt( (2 * 1 GeV ) / (198 GeV/c²) ) ) → units

---------------

: GeV / GeV c^{-2} → c².

So, v1^2 = (2 *1) / 198 *

---------------

 c² → 2/198 = 1/99 → v1 = c / sqrt(99) ≈ 0.1005 c.

So, non

---------------

-rel v1 is 0.1005 c.

In the relativistic case, using the velocity from gamma.



---------------

gamma = 1.010101 → v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2)) ) → sqrt

---------------

(1 - 0.9804) = sqrt(0.0196) → 0.14 c.

So, in

---------------

 rel case, v1 is 0.14 c.

So, the non-rel velocity is 0.1005 c, and the rel velocity is 0.14 c.

So, the

---------------

 non-rel K1 is (1/2) m1 v1^2 = 1 GeV.

The rel K1 is (gamma-1) m1 c^2 = 2 GeV.

So, the difference is 1 GeV.

But the

---------------

 options don't have that, so perhaps the intended answer is option D) 20 MeV, but I'm not seeing the

---------------

 error.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the difference to be small because the velocities are low, but in this case, the relativistic KE

---------------

 is significantly higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.

Wait, gamma = 1.010101 →

---------------

 gamma-1 = 0.010101.

So, for m1 = 198 GeV, K

---------------

1_rel = 0.010101 * 198 GeV = 2 GeV.

Yes

---------------

, correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll proceed with the conclusion that the difference is 1 GeV, which is not among the options, but perhaps the intended answer is option D) 20 MeV,

---------------

 but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem

---------------

 considers the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment as T1, and the difference is the relativistic T1 minus the non-rel T1.

In

---------------

 that case, the difference is 1 GeV, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I'm

---------------

 using the sum of rest masses as 0.99 M, but perhaps it's the sum of rest energies that's 99% of the initial rest energy.

Wait, initial

---------------

 rest energy is 300 GeV. So 99% is 297 GeV. So sum of rest energies is 297 GeV. So the

---------------

 mass sum is 297 GeV / c², which is 0.99 M, correct.

Hmm. I'm not sure

---------------

 where I went wrong, but based on the calculations, the difference is 1 GeV, which is not among the options. So

---------------

 perhaps the intended answer is option D) 20 MeV, but I'm not confident.


The problem involves an atomic nucleus of rest mass energy 300 GeV undergoing spontaneous fission into two fragments. The more massive fragment has twice the rest mass of the lighter one, and the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass, i.e., 297 GeV. The total energy released in the process is 3 GeV, which is distributed

---------------

 as the kinetic energy of the two fragments. The task is to compute the difference between the relativistic and non-relativistic kinetic energies of the more massive fragment, \( T_1 \).

### Key Analysis:

1. **Rest Masses of Fragments**:
   - Let the rest masses of the two fragments be \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \), with \( m_1 = 2m_2 \).
   - The sum of rest masses is \( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \), where \( M = 300 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \).
   - Solving, \( m_1 = 0.66M = 198 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_2 = 0.33M = 99 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \).

2. **Total Kinetic Energy**:
   - The initial rest energy is \( M c^2 = 300 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - The total rest energy of the fragments is \( (m_1 + m_2)c^2 = 297 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - The total kinetic energy of the fragments is \( 300 - 297 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

3. **Non-Relativistic Case**:
   - Using conservation of momentum, \( m_1 v_1 = m_2 v_2 \), and the relationship

---------------

 \( v_2 = 2v_1 \) (since \( m_1 = 2m_2 \)).
   - The kinetic energies are \( K_1 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 \) and \( K_2 = \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2 \).
   - Substituting \( v_2 = 2v_1 \), \( K_1 + K_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \) gives \( K_1 = 1 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( K_2 = 2 \, \text{GeV} \).

4. **Relativistic Case**:
   - The total energy of each fragment is \( E_1 = \gamma m_1 c^2 \) and \( E_2 = \gamma m_2 c^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \).
   - Conservation of energy gives \( \gamma (m_1 + m_2)c^2 = M c^2 \), leading to \( \gamma = \frac{1}{0.99} \approx 1.0101 \).
   - The relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is \( K_1 = (\gamma - 1)m_1 c^2 \).
   - Substituting \( \gamma - 1 \approx 0.0101 \) and \( m_1 c^2 = 198 \, \text{GeV} \), \( K_1 \approx 2 \, \text{GeV} \).

5. **Difference Between Relativistic and Non-Relativistic \( T_1 \)**:
   - The non-relativistic \( K_1 \) is \( 1 \, \text{GeV} \), and the relativistic \( K_1 \) is \( 2 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - The difference is \( 2 - 1 = 1 \, \text{GeV} = 1000 \, \text{MeV} \).

6. **Dis

---------------

crepancy with Options**:
   - The calculated difference of \( 1000 \, \text{MeV} \) does not match any of the provided options (\( 2, 5, 10, 20 \, \text{MeV} \)).
   - This suggests a possible error in the problem setup or interpretation. However, based on the calculations, the closest

---------------

 plausible answer is **D) 20 MeV**, though the reasoning for this discrepancy is unclear.

### Conclusion:
The relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is significantly higher than the non-relativistic value, but the exact difference does not align with the provided options. Given the constraints, the most reasonable choice is:
