Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about the reaction of a specific compound with hydrogen bromide (HBr) and the resulting products as

---------------

 seen by TLC. Hmm.

The compound given is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me draw its structure to

---------------

 visualize better. The benzene ring has an ether group attached, right? The ether part is O connected to a butenyl group. The

---------------

 butenyl is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, wait, no. Wait, but-

---------------

3-en-1-yl means the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH

---------------

3)2-CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-?

---------------

 Wait, maybe I should think again.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl: The butenyl group is four carbons long

---------------

, with the double bond starting at carbon 3. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2 but

---------------

 that can't be right. Wait, no. Let's number the butenyl from the oxygen. The oxygen is attached to the first carbon of the butenyl. So,

---------------

 the structure is O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond. Oh, wait, the

---------------

 structure is O-CH2-CH2-C(=CH2)-CH3? Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 it's O-CH2-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, because the but

---------------

-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4. So the structure is O

---------------

-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons. Wait

---------------

, but that can't be because but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-O-

---------------

 attached to benzene. Wait, perhaps it's O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between

---------------

 C3 and C4, but that would be impossible because the chain would be four carbons long. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused

---------------

.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, that

---------------

 doesn't fit the butenyl description. Let me try to write it correctly. But-3-en-1-yl is

---------------

 CH2=CHCH2CH2-O- attached to benzene. Wait, no. Wait, the butenyl group is CH

---------------

2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond. But the numbering is from the oxygen. So,

---------------

 the first carbon is the one attached to oxygen. So, the structure is O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2,

---------------

 but where is the double bond? Oh, wait, but the position is 3-en, so the double bond is between C3 and C4.

---------------

 Wait, but that would be the third and fourth carbons, but in a four-carbon chain, that would be between

---------------

 the third and fourth. So the structure would be O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, but

---------------

 that can't be because the chain isn't long enough. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, but

---------------

-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-O- attached to benzene. So

---------------

 the structure is O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C1 and C2? No, wait

---------------

, because the double bond is at position 3. Oh, wait, perhaps it's O-CH2-CH2-C(=CH2)-.

---------------

 Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck on this. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2 but

---------------

 with a double bond. Wait, the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl, so the structure is O

---------------

-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond. Oh wait, the but

---------------

-3-en-1-yl would be O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. No, because

---------------

 butenyl is four carbons, so that would make it O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2,

---------------

 but that's but-1-enyl? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe the correct structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 but

---------------

 with a double bond. Wait, but the but-3-en-1-yl implies that the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4,

---------------

 but in a four-carbon chain, the positions are 1,2,3,4. So the double bond between

---------------

 3 and 4 would be impossible because that's the end. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the correct structure is O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2 but that doesn't fit

---------------

 the butenyl part. Alternatively, maybe the structure is O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2 but

---------------

 with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but that would make it O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2 with

---------------

 a double bond between CH2 and CH2, which isn't possible. Hmm, maybe I should move on and think about the reaction.

So the compound is an

---------------

 ether, with a benzene ring attached via an oxygen to a butenyl group that has two methyl groups on the second carbon. So the

---------------

 structure is O-benzene attached to a butenyl group where the second carbon has two methyl substituents. So the

---------------

 butenyl group is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond? Wait, but

---------------

 where is the double bond? Let me correct: the group is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So the structure

---------------

 is O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Or

---------------

 wait, but but-3-en-1-yl: the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the

---------------

 structure is O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. But that's

---------------

 impossible because the chain would be four carbons, so C3 and C4 are the third and fourth, but that would require

---------------

 a four-carbon chain with the double bond between third and fourth, which isn't possible as the fourth is the end. So

---------------

 perhaps it's O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. But that would be but-1-enyl,

---------------

 right? Because the double bond is between C1 and C2 in that case. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on

---------------

 the structure. Maybe it's better to think about the reaction.

The reaction is with HBr. So, the compound is an ether with a double

---------------

 bond adjacent to a branching point. When alkenes react with HBr, they typically undergo addition reactions, like acid-catalyzed addition.

---------------

 But ethers are generally not reactive towards HBr. Wait, but if the ether is adjacent to a double bond, perhaps it

---------------

 can undergo some kind of acid-catalyzed reaction.

Wait, but in this case, the compound is an allyl ether. The

---------------

 structure is benzene-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2? No, perhaps the structure

---------------

 is O-benzene attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a C(CH3)2 group, which is attached to a CH2 group

---------------

, which is attached to a CH2. But with a double bond in the butenyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's O-benzene-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait

---------------

, but the double bond is between C3 and C4, so in a four-carbon chain, that's the end, so it

---------------

's CH2-CH2-C=CH2. So the structure would be O-benzene-CH2-CH2-C(=CH2)-CH3? Wait, but

---------------

 that would make the structure O-benzene-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Hmm.

Wait

---------------

, perhaps I should think of the structure as O-benzene attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a C(CH3)2 group, but that

---------------

 doesn't fit the butenyl. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O-benzene-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 but

---------------

 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons. Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would have

---------------

 the double bond between C3 and C4, which would be the end. So the structure would be O-benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. But

---------------

 that's impossible because that's the end. So maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O-benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2,

---------------

 but with a double bond somewhere else.

Alternatively, maybe it's O-benzene attached to a CH2 group, then a CH(CH3)2 group, but

---------------

 with a double bond. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's proceed.

When HBr is added to an allyl ether, what

---------------

 reaction occurs? Well, HBr can add to the double bond via an acid-catalyzed mechanism. Alternatively, in

---------------

 some cases, allyl ethers can undergo acid-catalyzed cleavage. Wait, but more commonly, when an allyl ether is treated with H

---------------

Br, it can undergo an addition reaction across the double bond. Alternatively, maybe the acid could protonate the ether oxygen, making it a better leaving group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the reaction is similar to the acid-catalyzed addition to alkenes. So, HBr would add across the double bond, leading

---------------

 to the formation of a bromide. But in this case, the double bond is in the butenyl group attached to the benzene via

---------------

 an ether.

So, let's think: the starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. The

---------------

 double bond is between C3 and C4. So, when HBr adds to this double bond, what would happen? In

---------------

 an acid-catalyzed addition, the H would add to one end and Br to the other. But since the double

---------------

 bond is in a substituted position, perhaps there's some possibility for different regiochemistry.

Wait, but in an allyl ether, the

---------------

 addition could be more complex. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a bromide at the end of the chain, but

---------------

 I'm not sure.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the reaction leads to the cleavage of the ether. Wait, but

---------------

 I don't think HBr typically cleaves ethers. Ethers are generally unreactive towards HBr unless there's a strong acid and specific

---------------

 conditions. Alternatively, perhaps under certain conditions, the ether could undergo some rearrangement.

Wait, another thought: when allyl ethers react with HBr, they

---------------

 can undergo a reaction called the acid-catalyzed cleavage of ethers, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the double

---------------

 bond in the allyl group could undergo addition, leading to a bromide.

Wait, perhaps the HBr adds to the double bond, leading

---------------

 to the formation of a bromide at the end. So, the double bond is between C3 and C4. Adding

---------------

 HBr would make the structure O-benzene-CH2-CH2-CBr(CH3)-CH2? No

---------------

, wait, adding HBr would make the bromide on the adjacent carbon. Let me think: the double bond is between C3 and C4. So

---------------

, when HBr adds, H would add to C3, and Br to C4, or vice versa.

Wait, the

---------------

 structure before reaction is O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. So

---------------

, adding HBr would result in either O-CH2-CH2-CH2Br-CH3 or O-CH2-CH2-CH3-CH2Br, but that

---------------

 doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the addition would occur in a way that the Br adds to the more substituted carbon.

---------------

 So, in this case, the double bond is between C3 and C4, which are both CH2 groups. Wait, but

---------------

 in the actual structure, perhaps the substituents are different.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O-benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2,

---------------

 but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Hmm, I'm getting stuck on the structure, which is making

---------------

 it hard to proceed. Maybe I should look at the reaction from another angle.

The TLC shows that the reactant spot has diminished, and two new spots have formed. So, the reaction is

---------------

 not complete, but two products have formed. The reaction is with HBr, which is a strong acid and a source of Br-.

Another

---------------

 possibility is that the ether undergoes acid-catalyzed cleavage. For example, under strong acidic conditions, ethers can cleave, especially if they're allylic or adjacent

---------------

 to a good leaving group. But I'm not sure if HBr alone would do that. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is

---------------

 an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the benzene ring, but that's unlikely because benzene is quite stable.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the reaction is an example of the formation of a bromide via addition to the double bond, leading to two possible products due to the

---------------

 possibility of addition in two different positions or maybe some rearrangement.

Wait, considering the structure again: the butenyl group is O

---------------

-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, because the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl. So the

---------------

 structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond? Or wait, perhaps

---------------

 it's O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond. No, maybe

---------------

 the correct structure is O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between the second

---------------

 and third carbons. Wait, but that would be but-2-en-1-yl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the structure is O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So, the double bond is between the third and fourth carbons.

---------------

 So, the structure is O-benzene-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

In that case, when HBr adds, the

---------------

 H would add to one end and Br to the other. So, possible addition would lead to two products: one where Br is on the third carbon and H on the fourth, and another where Br is on the fourth and H on the third. But wait

---------------

, in allylic systems, there might be some possibility of carbocation rearrangements, leading to different products.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 the reaction leads to the formation of a bromide at the end of the chain. So, when HBr adds to the double bond, the more

---------------

 substituted carbon would get the Br. In this case, the double bond is between C3 and C4, which are both CH2 groups,

---------------

 so addition would be straightforward, leading to either 3-bromo or 4-bromo product. But wait, the structure

---------------

 is O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So, the double bond is between C3 and C4,

---------------

 with C3 being attached to a CH2 group and C4 to a CH2 group. Wait, but in that case, when

---------------

 HBr adds, the Br would add to the more substituted carbon, which in this case, both are equally substituted, so it

---------------

 would lead to a single product.

Hmm, but the TLC shows two new spots, which suggests two products. So, perhaps the reaction doesn

---------------

't just add HBr to the double bond but leads to some rearrangement or cleavage.

Wait, another possibility is that the reaction

---------------

 undergoes a ring-opening of the benzene via some mechanism, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the double bond is

---------------

 in a position that allows for some hydride shift or carbocation rearrangement, leading to different products.

Wait, let

---------------

 me think about the addition of HBr to the double bond. Let's say the structure is O-benzene-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. When

---------------

 HBr adds, the proton adds to one end, and Br to the other, forming a carbocation intermediate. But the

---------------

 position of the carbocation could lead to a rearrangement.

For example, if the Br adds to the end (C4), then the carbocation would form on C3. But

---------------

 C3 is attached to a CH2 group and a C(CH3) group, so maybe it's more stable. Alternatively, if

---------------

 the Br adds to C3, then the carbocation would form on C4, which is attached to a CH2 group and

---------------

 perhaps less stable, leading to a hydride shift to form a more stable carbocation.

Wait, but wait, the

---------------

 structure after adding HBr would be O-benzene-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)-CH2Br,

---------------

 assuming Br adds to C4. Or O-benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2Br-C(CH3), but

---------------

 I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the addition leads to a bromide on C3 and C4.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition

---------------

 leads to two different products due to different regiochemistry or possible carbocation rearrangements.

Wait, another angle: when

---------------

 HBr adds to an allyl ether, it can lead to the formation of a bromide at the end of the chain.

---------------

 But in this case, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of two different bromides, such as 4-bromo and 3-bromo products, depending on where the addition occurs.

Looking

---------------

 at the options, option D is (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. So,

---------------

 these would be the two products if the bromine adds to either the third or fourth carbon of the butenyl group.

Alternatively

---------------

, option B has a bromo product and another ether with a different double bond position. So, perhaps the reaction leads to the

---------------

 formation of a bromide and another ether with a different structure.

Wait, but if the double bond is in the butenyl group, adding HBr would satur

---------------

ate the double bond, leading to a single bromide product. But since two products are formed, maybe there's a possibility of different

---------------

 regioselectivity or some rearrangement.

Another possibility is that the reaction doesn't just add HBr to the double bond but also

---------------

 cleaves the ether. For example, if the ether oxygen is protonated, making it a better leaving group, and then the

---------------

 adjacent carbon could form a carbocation, leading to cleavage. But I'm not sure if that would happen with HBr alone.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads

---------------

 to the formation of a phenol and a bromide. But the starting material is an ether, so that's possible.

---------------

 Wait, how? If the HBr adds to the double bond, and then the oxygen leaves as an alcohol, but that seems

---------------

 unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an example of acid-catalyzed cleavage of the ether. For example, if

---------------

 the ether is treated with HBr, the oxygen could be protonated, leading to cleavage. But I'm not sure

---------------

 about that. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is in a position that allows for some kind of ring-opening or rearrangement.

Wait

---------------

, maybe the reaction is more about the allyl group. If the double bond is in the allyl position, adding HBr could lead to a

---------------

 bromide at the end. But if the structure is such that the double bond is conjugated with the ether oxygen, perhaps

---------------

 it can lead to some kind of cyclic transition state or rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benz

---------------

yl bromide and another product. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option A: Two phenol derivatives. So

---------------

, perhaps the reaction involves the cleavage of the ether to form a phenol and another compound.

Option B: Two ether

---------------

 products, one with Br and another with a different double bond position.

Option C: Two cyclic structures, like chromane and something else.

Option D: Two ether products with Br at different positions.

So

---------------

, if the reaction is the addition of HBr to the double bond, then the product would be a single bromide. But since two products are formed, perhaps there

---------------

's some rearrangement.

Wait, another possibility is that the reaction undergoes a hydride shift after the initial addition, leading to two different products. For example, initial

---------------

 addition of HBr could form a bromide on one carbon, but then a hydride shift could move the bromide to a different position, leading to two products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction

---------------

 leads to the formation of a bromide and another product where the double bond has shifted.

Wait, looking at option B: (

---------------

4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. So, the first product is a bromide at

---------------

 position 4, and the second is an ether with a double bond between C2 and C3, with methyl groups on C2 and C3.

So

---------------

, perhaps the reaction is such that HBr adds to the double bond in two different ways, leading to different positions of the

---------------

 Br. Or perhaps the reaction leads to a shift in the double bond position, forming a new ether with a different double bond.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an acid-catalyzed hydration of the double bond, but that doesn't fit with HBr.

Hmm. Another

---------------

 thought: perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of the benzene via some mechanism, but I don't think so.

Wait, considering

---------------

 the structure again: the starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So, the structure

---------------

 is O-benzene attached to a butenyl group where the double bond is between C3 and C4, and the second carbon has two methyl groups.

So, the structure is O-benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2 with

---------------

 a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but that would make the structure O-benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Hmm

---------------

, but that would be O-benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2,

---------------

 but that can't have a double bond between C3 and C4 because the chain is only four carbons. Wait, perhaps it's O-benzene-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. So

---------------

, the structure would be O-benzene-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that would

---------------

 make the double bond between the third and fourth carbons, which is at the end, so perhaps it's O-benzene-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

Wait

---------------

, but but-3-en-1-yl would imply that the double bond is between C3 and C4. So, the

---------------

 structure is O-benzene-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, that makes more sense. So, the double

---------------

 bond is between C3 and C4. So, the structure is O-benzene-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but with

---------------

 methyl groups on the second carbon. Wait, no, the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl, so the structure is O-benzene-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. So

---------------

, the double bond is between C3 and C4, with C2 having two methyl groups.

In that case, when HBr adds to the double bond, the Br

---------------

 could add to C3 or C4. Let's see: adding H to C3 and Br to C4, or H to C4 and Br to C3.

Wait

---------------

, but in an acid-catalyzed addition, the H adds to the less substituted carbon, and Br to the more substituted. So

---------------

, in this structure, the double bond is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. Wait, no, the

---------------

 structure is O-benzene-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait

---------------

, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O-benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. Hmm

---------------

, I'm getting stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O-benzene-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So, the double bond is between C3 and C4, with C3 having a methyl group.



---------------

In this case, adding HBr would result in the formation of a bromide. The H would add to C3, and Br to C4. So

---------------

, the product would be O-benzene-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)Br-CH2.

But wait

---------------

, that would be a secondary bromide. Alternatively, if the H adds to C4, then Br would be on C3, which

---------------

 is more substituted (since C3 is attached to a methyl group). So, that might be more favorable.

Wait, but

---------------

 if the Br adds to C3, which is attached to a methyl group, making it more substituted, that would be more stable. So, the major product would be O

---------------

-benzene-CH2-CH2-CBr(CH3)-CH2.

But then why are two products formed? Unless

---------------

 there's a possibility of different regiochemistry or some rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps the addition leads to a bromide on

---------------

 C4, and another product where the double bond shifts. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a bromide and some

---------------

 other product, like a di-substituted ether.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of the ether. If

---------------

 the ether oxygen is protonated, making it a better leaving group, and then the adjacent carbon forms a carbocation, which could lead to cleavage. But I

---------------

'm not sure if HBr alone would do that.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement. Suppose

---------------

 HBr adds to the double bond, forming a carbocation that can rearrange. For example, if the initial addition forms a less

---------------

 stable carbocation, it could rearrange to a more stable one, leading to different products.

In the structure O-benzene-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2, adding HBr to

---------------

 the double bond would form a carbocation on C4 (if Br adds to C3) or C3 (if Br adds to C4). Wait

---------------

, but if Br adds to C3, which is already substituted with two methyl groups, that might be more stable, so the

---------------

 carbocation would form on C4. But C4 is a primary carbon, which is not very stable. So, perhaps the carbocation would rearrange via a hydride shift to form a more stable carbocation elsewhere.

Wait

---------------

, for example, if the initial addition leads to a carbocation on C4, which is primary, it might undergo a hydride shift to form a carbocation on C3, which is more

---------------

 substituted. But C3 is attached to two methyl groups, so that would be more stable. So, the carbocation would form

---------------

 on C3, leading to a different product.

So, in that case, the initial addition could lead to two different carbocations, or

---------------

 perhaps the reaction could proceed through different pathways, leading to two different products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't involve addition to the double bond but rather some other mechanism. Hmm

---------------

.

Looking at the options, option D has two products where the bromine is on the 3rd and 4th positions of the butenyl group. So, that

---------------

 would fit with the addition of HBr leading to bromides on either position.

But why would there be two products? Maybe

---------------

 because the reaction can proceed via different addition paths, leading to different regioselectivity, or perhaps some carbocation rearrangement.



---------------

Another thought: maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a bromide and a di-substituted product, such as a di

---------------

-bromide, but that seems less likely with HBr.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a bromide and some

---------------

 other product, such as a phenol, if the ether cleaves. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads

---------------

 to the formation of a bromide and an allylic bromide, but that's speculative.

Wait, another approach: think

---------------

 about the reaction conditions. HBr is a strong acid, so it can protonate the double bond, making it more electrophilic, and then add

---------------

 Br-.

In the case of an allyl ether, the addition of HBr could lead to the formation of a bromide at

---------------

 the end of the chain, but also perhaps some rearrangement.

But I'm not making much progress. Let me think about the options again.

Option B: (

---------------

4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene.

So, one product is a bromide at

---------------

 position 4, and the other is an ether with a double bond between C2 and C3, with methyl groups on both C2 and C3.

Hmm

---------------

, that suggests that the double bond has shifted from C3-C4 to C2-C3, which could happen via a carbocation rearrangement.

So, the

---------------

 initial addition of HBr to the double bond between C3 and C4 would form a bromide on C4 (or

---------------

 C3), but then a hydride shift could move the carbocation to C2, leading to a new double bond between C2 and C3.

So

---------------

, the first product is the bromide at C4, and the second product is the ether with the double bond shifted.

That

---------------

 would explain two products.

Similarly, option D has two bromides, which would suggest that the bromide adds to either C3 or C4, but why

---------------

 two bromides? Unless there's some regioselectivity leading to two different bromides, but I'm not sure.

Option

---------------

 C has two cyclic structures, which would require some kind of ring formation, perhaps via a pinacol rearrangement or similar, but I'm not sure.

Option A has two phenols, which would imply that the ether has cleaved to form phenol and another compound, but that would

---------------

 require the cleavage of the ether, which I'm not sure HBr would do.

So, given all this, I

---------------

 think the most plausible scenario is that the reaction adds HBr to the double bond, forming a bromide, and possibly a rearrangement leading

---------------

 to a new double bond position. So, the products would be a bromide and an ether with a shifted double bond.

Looking at the options, option B fits

---------------

 this scenario. The first product is a bromide at position 4, and the second is an ether with the double bond between C2 and C3, with

---------------

 methyl groups on both.

So, the answer would be option B.


The reaction involves treating ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). The starting material is an allyl ether, where the benzene ring is attached to an ether group (-O-) that is further connected to a butenyl group. The butenyl group has a double bond between C3 and C4, with two methyl groups attached to C2. The reaction with HBr likely proceeds via acid-catalyzed addition to the double bond, forming a bromide. However, the presence of two new spots in the TLC suggests that two products are formed, likely due to reg

---------------

ioselectivity or rearrangement during the reaction.

When HBr adds to the double bond, the bromine atom adds to the more substituted carbon (C3), while the hydrogen adds to the less substituted carbon (C4). This forms a carbocation intermediate at C4. However, since C4 is a primary carbon and less stable, a hydride shift occurs, moving the carbocation to C3, which is more substituted and stable. This rearrangement leads to two distinct products:

1. **(4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene**: This is the product where the bromine is added to C4 of the butenyl group.
2. **((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene**: This is the product where the double bond shifts from C3-C4 to C2-C3 due to the hydride shift, forming a new ether with a double bond between C2 and C3.

Option

---------------

 B matches this scenario, as it includes both the brominated product and the ether with the shifted double bond. The other options do not align with the reaction mechanism or the observed products.
