Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transition probabilities. Hmm, let's try to think through this. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try

---------------

 to remember what I learned.

The question is about the state |3,0,0> decaying to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I

---------------

 need to find the correct transition route and the corresponding probability among the options given.

Wait, dipole transitions... Oh right, in

---------------

 the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels via emission or absorption of a photon, which is a dipole transition. The

---------------

 selection rules for dipole transitions are important here. The selection rules for l (the angular momentum quantum number) and m (the magnetic quantum number) are

---------------

 Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1.

So, the initial state is |3,0,0>. It

---------------

 needs to go through two transitions to reach |1,0,0>. Let me break it down step by step.

First transition: from n=3 to some

---------------

 intermediate state, then from there to n=1. Each step must follow the selection rules.

Starting with |3,0,0>. The

---------------

 possible l for the next state must be l = 0 ±1. Since the initial l is 0, the next l can be 1. So,

---------------

 the first transition must go to a state with l=1. Also, m can change by -1, 0, +1. The

---------------

 initial m is 0, so m can become -1, 0, or +1.

So the possible states after the first transition are |2,1, -1>, |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>, and

---------------

 maybe even |1,1, -1>, etc. But wait, since we're going to n=1 in two steps, the

---------------

 first transition must take n=3 to n=2 because 3 → 2 → 1 is two steps, each changing

---------------

 by one n. Because each dipole transition changes n by ±1. Wait, no, wait. The dipole selection rules for

---------------

 n are Δn = ±1? Or is that for electric dipole? Oh yeah, I think for electric dipole transitions, the selection rule is Δn = ±1.

---------------

 So from n=3, you can only go to n=2 or n=4, but since the final state is n=1, you

---------------

 have to go down two steps. So two transitions: 3 → 2 → 1.

So the first transition is from n=3, l=0, m=0 to n=2, l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1.

So

---------------

 the first step is |3,0,0> → |2,1, m>, where m is -1,0, or +1.

Then the second transition is

---------------

 from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>. Let's see what's allowed here.

For the second transition, from

---------------

 n=2, l=1, m=? to n=1, l=0, m=0.

The selection rules again

---------------

: Δl = ±1. So from l=1, you can go to l=0 or l=2. But the target is l=0, so that's allowed. For

---------------

 m, Δm can be 0, ±1. So m in the intermediate state can change by 0, +1, or -1 to reach m=0.

So

---------------

 let's see the possible intermediate states after the first transition:

Option 1: |2,1,1> → in

---------------

 the second step, m can go down by 1 to reach m=0. So |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>

---------------

 is allowed.

Option 2: |2,1,0> → m doesn't change, so that's allowed too

---------------

. So |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> is allowed.

Option 3: |2,1,-1> → m can

---------------

 go up by 1 to reach 0. So that's allowed as well.

So any of these m values in the intermediate state could

---------------

 work. But the question is about the transition routes, so the options are about which intermediate states are used.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, probability 1/3.

Option B: |

---------------

3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>, probability 1/4.

Option C: |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>, probability 1/4.

Option D: Well

---------------

, looking at the options, D says |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, and probability 2/3. Wait

---------------

, the option seems cut off in the question. Let me check again.

Wait, the options are:

A) |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> and 1/3.

B) |

---------------

3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0> and 1/4.

C) |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0> and 1/4.

D) The

---------------

 transition route seems unclear in the question. Let me check the original question again.

Wait, the user wrote: "D) \rangle\rightarrow|2,1,0\rangle\rightarrow|1,0,0\rangle and \frac{2}{3}"

---------------

.

Wait, that seems like a typo, the first part of D is missing. So probably D is |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> and 2/3.

So

---------------

 the question is about which transition path is correct and what is the probability.

Now, the problem is to find the correct probability

---------------

 for the given transitions.

Wait, but how do we calculate the transition probability? I think the probability depends on the square of the transition dipole moment, which involves

---------------

 the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or Wigner 3-j symbols. Alternatively, the transition probability can be determined by the number

---------------

 of possible paths and the selection rules.

Wait, but perhaps a simpler approach is to think about the possible intermediate states and the

---------------

 possible m transitions. So from |3,0,0>, the first transition can go to any of the |2,1,m> states where m=-1,0,1.

Then

---------------

 from each of those, the second transition can go to |1,0,0> only if the m changes appropriately.

But

---------------

 the overall probability would be the sum of the squares of the transition amplitudes for each possible path.

Wait, but the

---------------

 options only show single-step paths, so perhaps each path contributes a certain probability, and the total is the sum.

Wait, but

---------------

 the problem states it's a two-step transition. So each transition is via an intermediate state, and each has its own probability.

But

---------------

 the question is about the probability of the entire process (the two-step transition), so the probability would be the product of the probabilities of each step.



---------------

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the overall transition probability is the sum of probabilities of all possible two-step paths.



---------------

Wait, but the options give specific transition paths and their probabilities. So perhaps each option represents a specific path and its probability, and we

---------------

 have to choose which path is possible and which probability is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the possible transition paths,

---------------

 and the correct one has the correct probability.

Wait, but the problem statement says the state decays via two dipole transitions, and

---------------

 the transition route and corresponding probability are given as options. So each option gives a possible route and the probability.

We need to find

---------------

 which option is correct.

So for each option, we can check if the transitions are allowed, and then compute the probability for

---------------

 each path.

But how to compute the probability?

In hydrogen atom transitions, the transition probability is proportional to the square of the matrix

---------------

 element of the dipole operator between the initial and final states. The dipole operator has components proportional to r Y_{l,m

---------------

}, where Y are spherical harmonics.

The transition amplitude is proportional to the integral of the initial wavefunction, the dipole operator, and the final wavefunction.

The

---------------

 matrix element for the dipole transition is non-zero only if the selection rules are satisfied, which we've already considered (Δl=±1, Δm=0,±1).

The

---------------

 probability for each transition step would depend on the square of the matrix element.

But for a two-step process, the total probability would be the product of the probabilities of each step.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the overall transition probability is the sum of the squares of the amplitudes for each possible intermediate state.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the correct approach is to calculate the number of possible paths.

Wait, from |3,0,0>, the first transition can go to |2,1, -1>, |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>. So

---------------

 three possible intermediate states.

Each of these can then transition to |1,0,0>, but let's check each:



---------------

- From |2,1,1> to |1,0,0>: m changes by -1 (from 1 to 0). So

---------------

 that's allowed.

- From |2,1,0> to |1,0,0>: m stays the same, allowed

---------------

.

- From |2,1,-1> to |1,0,0>: m changes by +1, allowed.

So all three intermediate states can transition

---------------

 to the final state.

Thus, the total amplitude is the sum of the amplitudes for each possible intermediate state.

Ass

---------------

uming each transition has an amplitude, the total amplitude is the sum, and the probability is the square of the amplitude.

But wait

---------------

, I'm not sure about the actual values of the probabilities for each transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition probabilities are determined by the number

---------------

 of possible ways, so the total probability is the sum of the squares of each possible path.

Wait, perhaps each intermediate state contributes

---------------

 a certain amount to the probability. For example, if each of the three paths has equal probability, the total would be 3 times the square of one path.

But I

---------------

'm not certain about that. Another approach is to use the Wigner-Eckart theorem, which tells us that the transition probability is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps the transition probabilities can be determined by the possible m changes.

Wait, for each step, the transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m> and

---------------

 then to |1,0,0>.

The transition dipole moment matrix elements are proportional to <2,1,m| r |3,0,0> and then <1,0,0| r |2,1,m>.

The

---------------

 overall amplitude would be the product of these two matrix elements.

But I'm not sure how to compute these exactly. Maybe I

---------------

 can find a pattern or a formula.

Wait, I remember that for electric dipole transitions in hydrogen, the transition probability is

---------------

 proportional to (2l_i +1)(something), but I'm not recalling exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the transition probability is

---------------

 proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of possible ways to

---------------

 go from |n,l,m> to |n', l', m'> is determined by the number of possible m transitions.



---------------

Wait, for each transition, the change in m can be -1, 0, +1.

But for each step

---------------

, the transition from m=0 in the first state to m in the intermediate state, then m to m=0 in the final state.

So

---------------

, the possible m changes are:

First transition: m changes from 0 to m1, where m1 can be -1, 0, +1.

Second transition: m1 changes to 0, so m1 can be -1, 0, +1.



---------------

Each of these contributes a term to the amplitude.

The amplitude is the sum over m1 of the product of the two transition amplitudes for each m1.

Ass

---------------

uming the transition amplitudes are real and the same for each m1, then the total amplitude would be the sum of each

---------------

 possible m1.

Wait, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps each m1 contributes a term, and the total

---------------

 amplitude is the sum of these terms.

But without knowing the exact values, maybe I can think about the symmetry. For example

---------------

, the transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m> might have different probabilities for m=-1, 0, +1.

Wait

---------------

, but for the first transition, the initial state is l=0, m=0. The dipole operator has components proportional

---------------

 to Y_1^m, so m can change by ±1, 0. So the transition to m=0,

---------------

 ±1 are possible.

But the probability for each m in the first step might be the same? Or perhaps not.

Wait, another

---------------

 approach: the matrix element <2,1,m | e r | 3,0,0> is proportional to the

---------------

 integral of Y_{1,m} Y_{0,0} Y_{L=1, M=0} }, but

---------------

 I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of possible transition paths and their probabilities

---------------

.

The initial state |3,0,0> can go to |2,1, -1>, |2,1,0>, |2,1,1> in the first step. Then

---------------

 each of these can go to |1,0,0>.

So for each possible intermediate state, the transition amplitude is non

---------------

-zero.

The total transition probability would be the sum of the probabilities of each possible two-step path.

So the total probability is P = P1 + P2 + P3, where each Pi is the product of the probabilities of each transition for that path.

But how

---------------

 to find each Pi?

Alternatively, perhaps each transition has an equal probability. But I don't think that's the case.



---------------

Wait, I remember that the transition probability is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding angular momenta l

---------------

1 and l2 to get L and M.

In the first transition, from l=0 (since |3,0,0> has l=0) to l'=1 (since |

---------------

2,1,m> has l=1). The dipole operator has l=1, so the transition is allowed.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=0 and l=1 to get l'=1 is

---------------

 non-zero only when the sum is possible. Wait, actually, the dipole operator is proportional to Y_1^m, so the matrix element <

---------------

2,1,m | r |3,0,0> is proportional to the integral of Y_{1,m} Y_{0,0} Y_{2,1,m}^

---------------

* ?

Hmm, maybe I'm complicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition probability for each m is proportional to the square of the Cle

---------------

bsch-Gordan coefficient for the transition.

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=0 and l=1 to get l=1 would

---------------

 be something like <1, m | 0,0 ; 1, m>. Since 0 and 1 combine to give

---------------

 1.

But I'm not entirely sure about the exact values. Alternatively, perhaps the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for

---------------

 each m is the same. For example, for m=0, it's sqrt(1/3), m=1,

---------------

 sqrt(1/3), etc.

Wait, I think the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining l=0 and l=1 to

---------------

 get l=1 are as follows:

For m = 1: the coefficient is 1/sqrt(2).

For m = 0: 

---------------

1/sqrt(6).

For m = -1: 1/sqrt(2).

Wait, no, I'm not confident

---------------

 about this. Maybe I should look up the CG coefficients for l=1 and l=0.

Wait, another approach: the

---------------

 CG coefficients for combining l=0 and l=1 to get l=1.

The CG coefficients are given by:

<1, m | 0,0 ; 1, m>



---------------

Which is non-zero only when m is in the range [-1, 1].

The CG coefficients for l=1 and m=

---------------

 -1, 0, +1 when combining l=0 and l=1 are:

For m=1: sqrt

---------------

(1/2) 

For m=0: sqrt(1/6)

For m=-1: sqrt(1/2)

Wait, but

---------------

 I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: the sum of squares should be 1, since they are orthonormal.

So 

---------------

1/2 + 1/6 + 1/2 = (3/6 + 1/6 + 3/6) )= 7/6?

---------------

 That can't be right because the sum should be 1.

Hmm, that suggests I'm wrong. Maybe I'm mixing

---------------

 up the coefficients.

Wait, perhaps the CG coefficients are different. For the combination of l=0 and l=1 to get l=1, the coefficients for

---------------

 each m are:

For m=1: 1/sqrt(2)

For m=0: 1/sqrt(6)

For m=-1: 1/sqrt(2)

Because

---------------

 (1/2) + (1/6) + (1/2) = (3/6 + 1/6 + 3/6) = 7/6,

---------------

 which is more than 1. So that can't be right. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the CG coefficients for the specific case of combining l=0 and l=1 to get L=1 are:

For m=1: 

---------------

1/sqrt(2)

For m=0: 0

For m=-1: 1/sqrt(2)

Wait, that doesn

---------------

't make sense because m=0 would have zero contribution, but I thought the transition to m=0 is allowed.

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps I should use the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The matrix element <f | r | i> is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient multiplied

---------------

 by the Gaunt integral.

But maybe that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the three possible intermediate states has the same transition probability,

---------------

 so each contributes 1/3 to the total probability. So the total probability would be the sum of (1/3) *

---------------

 (1/3) for each path, but wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps each step has a

---------------

 certain probability, and the two steps are independent. So the total probability for a specific path (like |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>) is the product of the probabilities of each step.

But without

---------------

 knowing the exact probabilities for each step, it's hard to calculate the total.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D, with

---------------

 probability 2/3, because the sum of the probabilities for all possible paths is 1, and if each path contributes 

---------------

1/3, but that's not matching the options.

Wait, let me think again. The initial state is |3,0,0>. The possible first transitions are to |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>, each with some

---------------

 probability.

Let's say each transition to these states has equal probability. Then each has a probability of 1/3.

Then, from each of these, the transition to |1,0,0> must

---------------

 happen. What's the probability of each second transition?

From |2,1,1> to |1,0,0>: m

---------------

 changes from 1 to 0, which is allowed. The probability would depend on the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. Similarly

---------------

 for the other states.

Wait, maybe the probability for each second transition is 1/3 as well.

So for each path, the probability would be (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9. But

---------------

 since there are three such paths, the total would be 3*(1/9)=1/3. So the total probability would be 1/3, which is

---------------

 option A's probability.

Wait, but option A has a probability of 1/3. So if all three paths contribute equally, the

---------------

 total would be 1/3. But in reality, the probabilities for each path might not be the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition

---------------

 probabilities for each step are not the same. For example, the transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,0> might have a higher probability than to |2,1,1> or |2,1,-1>.

Wait

---------------

, but why would that be? The initial state is spherically symmetric (l=0), so transitions to any m are

---------------

 equally likely. Hmm, but the dipole operator has components for m=0, ±1, so perhaps the transition probabilities for

---------------

 m=0 are higher.

Wait, but no, because the dipole operator has three components (m= -1, 0, +1), each contributing

---------------

 equally. So perhaps each m has the same transition probability for the first step.

Wait, but the matrix element <2,1,m | e r |3,0,0> would

---------------

 be proportional to the integral of Y_{1,m} Y_{0,0} Y_{2,1,m}^* ?



---------------

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the selection rules and the possible options.

Looking at the options, option

---------------

 A is |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, probability 1/3.

Option B and C have probability

---------------

 1/4 each, and D has 2/3.

But wait, the total probability of all possible two-step paths should sum up to something

---------------

 less than or equal to 1.

If each possible path contributes equally, and there are three possible paths (m=-1,0,1), each with

---------------

 probability 1/3, then the total would be 3*(1/3 * 1/3) = 1/3. But

---------------

 that's just the sum for each path, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition

---------------

 probabilities for the first step are as follows:

The transition to m=0 has a higher probability than m=±1. Because

---------------

 the dipole operator has a component along the quantization axis (m=0), so transitions where m doesn't change are

---------------

 more probable.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the transition probability for m=0 is 

---------------

1/3, and for m=±1 each is 1/3 as well. So each first step has 

---------------

1/3 probability.

Then, for each of these, the second step would have a certain probability.

Wait, for the transition from |2,1,0> to |1,0,0>, the

---------------

 m doesn't change, so the probability is higher?

Alternatively, perhaps the transition from |2,1,0> to |1,0,0> has a higher probability than from |2,1,1> or |2,1,-1>.

Because

---------------

 when m doesn't change, the transition is more probable.

If that's the case, then the path through |2,1,0> would have a higher probability, contributing

---------------

 more to the total.

But I'm not sure how much higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition probability is higher for m=0 because

---------------

 of the symmetry.

But without exact calculations, it's hard to say. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, another

---------------

 thought: the initial state is |3,0,0>, and the final state is |1,0,0>.

In

---------------

 the first transition, the electron goes from n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1.

The possible

---------------

 m values are -1,0,1.

The probability of each transition depends on the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for the transition

---------------

.

The CG coefficient for combining l=0 and l=1 to get l=1 is as follows:

For m=1: sqrt

---------------

(1/2)

For m=0: 0

Wait, that can't be right because the sum of squares would be 1/2 + 0 + 1/2 = 1.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 for m=1 and m=-1, the CG coefficients are sqrt(1/2), and m=0 is 0. So

---------------

 the transition to m=0 is not allowed?

But that contradicts the selection rules. Because the initial state is m=0, and the dipole operator has m=±1 and 0, so transitions

---------------

 to m=0 are allowed.

Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the CG coefficients. Maybe in this specific case, the transition to m=0 is allowed,

---------------

 but with a different CG coefficient.

Alternatively, perhaps the CG coefficients for adding l=0 and l=1 to get l=1 are as

---------------

 follows:

For m=1: sqrt(1/2)

For m=0: 1/sqrt(6)

For m=-1: sqrt(1/2)

Because

---------------

 then the squares add up to 1/2 + 1/6 + 1/2 = (3/6 + 1/6 + 3/6 ) = 7/6, which is more than 1, so that's not possible. So

---------------

 perhaps I'm incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the CG coefficients are different. Let me try to think again.

The CG coefficients for combining

---------------

 l1=0 and l2=1 to get L=1:

The possible m values are m = m1 + m2, where m1 is from l1=0 (so m1=0), and m2 can be -1, 0, +1.

So for

---------------

 L=1 and M=1: m1=0 and m2=1 → CG coefficient is 1/sqrt(2)

For M=0: m1=0 and m2=0 → CG coefficient is 1/sqrt(2) *

---------------

 sqrt(2/3) )?

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the factors. Alternatively, perhaps the CG coefficients are given

---------------

 by:

<1, m | 0,0; 1, m> = sqrt( (2 - m)/(

---------------

2(2 + m)) ) * something.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the CG coefficients for l=1 and m=

---------------

1,0,-1 when combining l=0 and l=1.

Wait, I found a reference that the CG coefficients for combining

---------------

 l=0 and l=1 to get L=1 are:

For M=1: 1/sqrt(2)

For M=0: 0

For M=-1: 1/sqrt(2)

Wait, that's

---------------

 not possible because that would imply that M=0 transition is forbidden, but according to selection rules, it's allowed.

Hmm

---------------

, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the CG coefficient for M=0 is non-zero, but I'm not finding

---------------

 the correct value.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition to M=0 is allowed, but with a different CG coefficient.

Wait, another

---------------

 approach: the sum of squares of the CG coefficients for a given L must be 1.

If for L=1, the CG coefficients for M=1, 0, -1 are a, b, a respectively, then 2a² + b² = 1.

If

---------------

 the transition to M=0 is allowed, then b must be non-zero.

But without knowing the exact values, perhaps I can proceed

---------------

 by assuming that each transition has an equal probability. That would make the first step have 3 possible states, each with probability 1/3.

Then, from each of these, the transition to the final state has

---------------

 a certain probability.

Wait, but for the second transition, from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>, the probability

---------------

 depends on the square of the CG coefficient for that transition.

Assuming each second transition has the same probability, say 1/3, then each path contributes

---------------

 (1/3)*(1/3)=1/9. With three paths, the total is 3*(1/9)=1/3, which would match

---------------

 option A's probability of 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps the second transition from |2,1,0> to |1,0,0> has a higher probability than

---------------

 from |2,1,1> or |2,1,-1> because m doesn't change.

So the path

---------------

 through |2,1,0> would contribute more to the total probability.

If the first step to |2,1,0> has probability 1/3, and the second step has probability 

---------------

1/2, then the total for that path is (1/3)*(1/2)=1/6.

Similarly

---------------

, the other two paths each contribute (1/3)*(1/4)=1/12 each. Then the total would be 1/6 + 1/12 + 1/12 = 1/6 + 2/12 = 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3.

So

---------------

 again, the total is 1/3, which would correspond to option A.

But I'm not sure about the probabilities for each step. Another

---------------

 possibility is that the transition from |2,1,0> to |1,0,0> has a higher probability because

---------------

 m remains the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition from |2,1,0> has a probability of 1/2, while the others have 1/4 each.

Wait

---------------

, let me think about the selection rules again. The dipole operator has three components, each corresponding to m= -1, 0, +1. So the

---------------

 transition probabilities for each m in the first step are the same.

Thus, the first step has three equally probable paths, each with probability 1/3.

Then, the second step's

---------------

 probability depends on the m of the intermediate state.

For example, from |2,1,1> to |1,0,0>, the change in m is -1, so that's allowed. The probability for

---------------

 this step might be 1/3.

Similarly, from |2,1,0> to |1,0,0>, the m doesn't change, so that

---------------

's allowed and perhaps has a higher probability, say 1/2.

Wait, but without exact values, this is speculative

---------------

.

Alternatively, perhaps each second transition has the same probability, regardless of the intermediate m. So each second step has probability 1/3.

Thus

---------------

, each path contributes (1/3)*(1/3) = 1/9, and the total is 3*(1/9) = 1/3, which would

---------------

 correspond to option A.

But wait, option A is the only one with probability 1/3, and the correct answer

---------------

 might be option D with 2/3. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible number of ways the

---------------

 transitions can happen. For the first step, there are three possible m values, each allowed. For each of these, the second step is

---------------

 allowed in only one way (since m must go from whatever to 0).

So the total number of possible two-step paths is 3. Each

---------------

 contributes a certain amount to the total probability.

If each step is equally probable, then each path contributes the same, and the total is 3*(1

---------------

/3 * 1/3) = 1/3, as before.

But perhaps the first step's probabilities are not equal. For

---------------

 example, the transition to m=0 might have a higher probability than m=±1.

Because the dipole operator has a component along

---------------

 the m=0 direction, which would make transitions where m doesn't change more probable.

So, perhaps the first transition to m=0 has a higher probability, say 1/2, and m=±1 each have 1/4.

Then, the second transition from |2,1,0> to |1,0,0> would

---------------

 have a higher probability, say 1/2, while the others have 1/3 each.

Wait, but without

---------------

 exact numbers, this is hard. Maybe another approach: the possible options are A, B, C, D. Among them, the

---------------

 correct transition must have intermediate states that are allowed.

Looking at the options, all options except D have the correct intermediate states (

---------------

since D seems to have a typo, but assuming it's |2,1,0>).

So the correct transition paths

---------------

 are any of the options A, B, C, or D, but the probability depends on the path.

But the question states

---------------

 that the decay occurs via two dipole transitions, so all options are possible in terms of allowed transitions.

But the correct answer

---------------

 is the one that correctly states the transition route and the probability.

Wait, another thought: the probability for the two-step transition via

---------------

 |2,1,0> would be the product of the first and second transition probabilities.

If the first transition to |2,1,0> has a probability of 1/3, and the second transition from |2,1,0> has a probability of 1/3, then the total for this path is 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9.

Similarly, the

---------------

 other paths would contribute 1/9 each, but since there are three, the total is 3*(1/9)=1/3. So the total

---------------

 probability would be 1/3, which is option A.

But wait, the question is about the transition route and the corresponding probability. So perhaps

---------------

 the correct answer is option A, as it's the only one with probability 1/3, which matches the total.



---------------

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, with probability 2/3, but I can't see why.

Wait, another

---------------

 approach: the transition from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> via two steps could also have

---------------

 other possible paths, but perhaps the given options only show the possible ones.

Wait, but the options only show single transition paths, so

---------------

 perhaps the question is about the dominant contribution.

Wait, perhaps the transition via |2,1,0> is more probable than the others, so

---------------

 option A's probability of 1/3 is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, with probability 2/3, but

---------------

 I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: the transition via |2,1,0> might have a higher probability because the

---------------

 m doesn't change, making it more likely. So perhaps the total probability is higher for this path, but I don't know the exact value.

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps the correct answer is option D with 2/3, but I can't justify it.

Hmm, maybe I should think

---------------

 about the possible number of ways the electron can transition. Since the initial state is spherically symmetric, perhaps the transition to

---------------

 m=0 is more probable, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the probability for the transition via |2,1,0> is 

---------------

1/3, and the other two paths contribute nothing because their probabilities are zero. But that can't be right because the

---------------

 selection rules allow them.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability for the path via |2,1,0> is higher.

Wait

---------------

, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, I'm probably overcomplicating this.

Wait

---------------

, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but the probability is 2/3. But I can't see why.

Wait

---------------

, another angle: the total probability for all possible two-step transitions is the sum of the probabilities of each path.

If each path has a probability of 1/4, and

---------------

 there are two paths (like options B and C), then their total would be 1/2, but that's not matching any option.

Wait, maybe

---------------

 the correct path is via |2,1,0>, which has the highest probability, and the others are negligible. So the probability

---------------

 is 1/3, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I can't see

---------------

 why.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible transition dipole moments. The transition dipole moment between |3,0,0> and |2,1,m> is non-zero only for m=-1,0,1.

The

---------------

 probability for each transition is proportional to the square of the matrix element.

The matrix element for the dipole transition is proportional to the integral of Y_{1,m} Y_{0,0} Y_{2,1,m}^*.

Wait

---------------

, but I'm not sure how to calculate this. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix element is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which for

---------------

 m=0 is zero? No, that can't be right because the selection rules allow it.

Wait, perhaps the matrix

---------------

 element is zero for m=0, but I don't think so. Because the dipole operator can cause transitions where m changes by 0, ±1.

Wait

---------------

, perhaps the transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,0> is forbidden because the dip

---------------

ole operator has l=1, and the initial state has l=0. So the transition is allowed for any m change

---------------

 of 0, ±1. So m=0 is allowed.

But perhaps the matrix element for m=0 is zero.

---------------

 That would be possible if the integral of Y_{1,0} Y_{0,0} Y_{2,1,0}^* is zero.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the Gaunt integral for Y_{1,0} Y_{0,0} Y_{2,1,0}^* is zero,

---------------

 making the transition to m=0 impossible. Then, the only possible transitions are m=±1.

In that case, the first transition can only go to |2,1,1> and |2,1,-1>, each with probability

---------------

 1/2.

Then, from each of these, the second transition to |1,0,0> must change m by -1 or +1, respectively.

So the

---------------

 transition from |2,1,1> to |1,0,0> is allowed (m changes by -1), and from

---------------

 |2,1,-1> to |1,0,0> is allowed (m changes by +1).

Ass

---------------

uming each first step has probability 1/2, and each second step has probability 1/2, then each path contributes (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4. With

---------------

 two paths, the total probability would be 2*(1/4)=1/2.

But none of the options have 1/2.

Alternatively, perhaps each second transition has a probability of 1/3, making each path contribute 1/2 * 1/3=1/6. Two

---------------

 paths sum to 2*(1/6)=1/3.

So the total would be 1/3, which is option A's probability.

Wait, but option

---------------

 A's path is |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, which we

---------------

're now assuming is forbidden because the matrix element is zero.

Hmm, this is getting really complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but

---------------

 I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the transition via |2,1,0> is forbidden because the matrix

---------------

 element is zero. So the only possible paths are via |2,1,1> and |2,1,-1>, each contributing 

---------------

1/4 to the probability, making the total 1/2. But again, no option matches.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct

---------------

 answer is option B or C, each with 1/4 probability, but then the total would be 1/2, but that

---------------

's not an option.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is option D, which has probability 2/3, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps the transition via |2,1,0> is allowed, and has a higher probability than the others, so

---------------

 the total probability is 2/3.

But without the exact calculation, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the

---------------

 correct answer is option A, which states a probability of 1/3, but I'm not certain.

Given the time I've spent on this, I think the most plausible answer is option A, with

---------------

 the path |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> and probability 1/3.


The question involves the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state in the hydrogen atom to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The analysis focuses

---------------

 on the selection rules for electric dipole transitions, which require Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. The initial state |3,0,0⟩ dec

---------------

ays through two steps: first to an intermediate state |2,1,m⟩ (where m = -1, 0, +1), and then to the final state |1,0,0⟩.

### Key Points:
1. **First Transition**: From |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩:
   - The selection rules allow transitions to |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.
   - The probabilities for these transitions depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which are proportional to the square of the matrix elements of the dipole operator.

2. **Second Transition**: From |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩:
   - For each intermediate state |2,1,m⟩, the transition to |1,0,0⟩ is allowed if the change in m (Δm) satisfies the selection rules.
   - The probabilities for these transitions also depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

3. **Total Probability**:
   - The total probability for the two-step transition is the sum of the probabilities for all possible paths: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, and |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.
   - Assuming equal probabilities for the first step (1/3 for each intermediate state), the second step probabilities depend on the specific intermediate state. For example, the transition from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ may have a higher probability due to the symmetry of the dipole operator.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3. This is plausible if the transition via |2,1,0⟩ dominates due to symmetry.
   - **Option B**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4. This is possible

---------------

 but less likely to dominate.
   - **Option C**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4. Similar to Option B, this is possible but less likely to dominate.
   - **Option D**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 2/3. This suggests a much higher probability for the |2,1,0⟩ intermediate state, which is inconsistent with the symmetry

---------------

 of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible answer is **Option A**, as it aligns with the idea that the transition via |2,1,0⟩ is more probable due to the symmetry of the dipole operator, and the total probability matches the expected value of 1/3.
