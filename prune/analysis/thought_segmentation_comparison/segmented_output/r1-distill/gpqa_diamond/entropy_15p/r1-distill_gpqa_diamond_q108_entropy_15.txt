Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particles emitted. Hmm, let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says that two nucleons (NN) are in a 1S0 state and emit a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. Paul

---------------

i statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. The

---------------

 final NN state has T(NN) = 0. I need to figure out which partial wave is not permitted. The options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, I

---------------

'm a bit fuzzy on some concepts here, so let me start by recalling what each term means.

The initial state is 1S0. The

---------------

 notation (2S+1)L(J) is given. So for 1S0, 2S+1 is

---------------

 1, meaning S=0. L is S, so L=0. J is 0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

When

---------------

 they emit a particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1. So the process is NN → NN' + X.

Wait

---------------

, actually, the system is emitting a particle, so it's more like the two nucleons are in a bound state and emit a particle, so

---------------

 the initial state is NN (bound) and the final state is NN' (maybe a different state) plus X. But

---------------

 the problem says the final NN state has T=0. So T is the isospin, right? So the is

---------------

ospin of the final NN state is T=0.

Wait, but the question is about partial waves. Partial waves are about

---------------

 the orbital angular momentum L of the emitted particle, I think. So the process involves the orbital angular momentum state of X,

---------------

 which is denoted by the lowercase letter in the options (like p, s, etc.).

The key point is about conservation of angular momentum and parity. Also

---------------

, Pauli's exclusion statistics are involved, which tie together the isospin, spin, and angular momentum.

The given

---------------

 equation is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. So T is equal

---------------

 to S plus L plus 1, modulo 2.

In the final state, T is 0. So substituting:



---------------

0 ≡ S + L + 1 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2.

So

---------------

 S and L must have opposite parity. Either S is even and L is odd, or vice versa.

But wait, what

---------------

 is S in this context? Wait, S is the spin quantum number of the NN state. Or is it the isospin? No

---------------

, wait. The equation says T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. So T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum.



---------------

Wait, no. Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So S is the total spin of the nucleons, L is their orbital angular momentum, and J is the total angular momentum. So S

---------------

 is the spin, L is orbital.

So in the final NN state, which has T=0, the isospin is

---------------

 0.

So the equation is T = S + L + 1 mod 2. So 0 ≡ S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2.

Which means that S and L must have

---------------

 opposite parity. So if S is even, L must be odd, and vice versa.

But wait, what's the spin

---------------

 S of the final NN state? The initial state is 1S0, so S=0. But when they emit a particle, does

---------------

 the spin change? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the initial state is the same as the final state's

---------------

 spin? Or does the spin change during the emission?

Wait, the initial state is 1S0, which has S=0, L=0, J=0. After

---------------

 emitting X, the final NN state must have some S', L', and J', and the emitted X has its own angular

---------------

 momentum, say, l. But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the main focus is on the conservation of angular momentum and parity.



---------------

Wait, but the problem is about the parity. The initial parity is that of the NN state, and the final parity is

---------------

 the product of the parity of the NN' state and the parity of X, considering the orbital angular momentum.

Wait, the

---------------

 parity of a state is given by (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum. So for the initial state, L

---------------

=0 → parity is +1.

When X is emitted, the orbital angular momentum l of X will contribute to the parity. The

---------------

 parity of X is given as -1. But the overall parity after emission would involve the orbital angular momentum l, and the parity

---------------

 of the X.

Wait, the total parity after emission would be the product of the parity of the NN' state and the parity of X,

---------------

 multiplied by (-1)^l, where l is the orbital angular momentum of X. Because when you have orbital angular momentum l between the two particles

---------------

, the parity is (-1)^l. But wait, the parity of the X is intrinsic, so perhaps the orbital angular momentum contributes

---------------

 as part of the process.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

The process is: NN

---------------

 (initial state) → NN' (final state) + X.

The parity of the initial state is P_initial = (-1)^L_initial = (-1)^0 = +1.

The parity of the final state must

---------------

 be the same as the initial, because parity is conserved in strong interactions, which I think is what's happening here.

---------------

 Wait, but if the emission is via the strong force, then parity is conserved. But wait, I'm not entirely

---------------

 sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's not necessarily conserved, but the problem says to make use of conservation of angular momentum and parity.

Wait, the problem statement

---------------

 says: "Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity." So parity must be conserved.

So the parity of the initial state equals

---------------

 the parity of the final state.

The parity of the initial state is (+1), as L_initial is 0.

The parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN' state and the parity of X, multiplied

---------------

 by (-1)^l, where l is the orbital angular momentum of X. Because when X is emitted, the orbital angular momentum l

---------------

 contributes a factor of (-1)^l to the parity.

So P_final = P_NN' * P_X * (-1)^l.

But

---------------

 since P_initial = P_final, we have:

(+1) = P_NN' * (-1) * (-1)^l → (+

---------------

1) = P_NN' * (-1)^{l+1}.

So rearranging:

P_NN' = (-1)^{l+1}.

But

---------------

 what is the parity of the NN' state? The parity of the NN' state is determined by their orbital angular momentum. So

---------------

 P_NN' = (-1)^{L_NN'}.

So substituting:

(-1)^{L_NN'} = (-1)^{l + 1}.

Which

---------------

 implies:

L_NN' ≡ l + 1 mod 2.

So L_NN' and l must have opposite parity. So

---------------

 if l is even, L_NN' is odd, and vice versa.

But wait, what is L_NN' in

---------------

 the options? Hmm, looking at the options, each option describes the final NN state as, for example, 7D1 or

---------------

 3S1, etc. The letters denote the orbital angular momentum.

Wait, the options list the final state as something

---------------

 like 3S1, which is (2S+1)L(J). So for 3S1, 2S+1=3 → S=1. L is S

---------------

 (the letter), which for S states is L=0. Wait, no, wait: in spectroscopic notation, the letters

---------------

 correspond to L. S is L=0, P is L=1, D is L=2, F is L=3, etc.

So for

---------------

 each option, the final state is a specific L value. For example:

Option D) 1S0 → 3P0 + s.

Wait

---------------

, the final state in the options is given as the NN state after emission. So each option's first part is the initial state, then

---------------

 the final state and the emitted particle.

Wait, the question says "the term symbol (e.g. 1S0)" is

---------------

 (2S+1)L(J). So in each option, the initial state is 1S0, and the final state is something

---------------

 else plus X.

So for each option, the emitted particle X has a certain angular momentum state (like p, s, etc.), which is

---------------

 the orbital angular momentum l of X.

So for example, option A: 1S0 →7D1 + p. The emitted

---------------

 particle is p, which is a p state, so l=1.

So for each option, the emitted particle has orbital angular momentum l.

---------------

 And the final NN state has a certain L value. So from earlier, we have L_NN' ≡ l +1 mod 2.

So

---------------

 for each option, compute L_NN' and l, see if L_NN' ≡ l +1 mod 2. If

---------------

 not, that partial wave is not permitted.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider the spin and isospin condition as well.

Earlier

---------------

, I had the equation:

T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2.

In

---------------

 the final state, T=0, so S(NN) + L(NN) +1 ≡ 0 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2.

So

---------------

 S and L must be of opposite parity.

But what is S in the final state?

The initial state has S=0. When

---------------

 emitting a particle, the spin might change, but I think in this case, the problem is considering the total spin S of the NN state

---------------

. Wait, but the initial state is 1S0, so S=0, and the final state's S'

---------------

 would be the same? Or does it change?

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think again.

The

---------------

 initial state is NN in 1S0: S=0, L=0, J=0.

After emitting X, the NN' state has

---------------

 S', L', and J'. The emitted X has spin, but I'm not sure if that affects the spin of the NN' state.

---------------

 Alternatively, perhaps the spin of NN' is the same as the initial S=0? Or does it change?

Wait, the

---------------

 problem statement says that the NN state emits X. So the NN' state must be in a state that is compatible with the initial state.

---------------

 Since the initial S is 0, perhaps the final S' is 0 as well. But wait, that might not necessarily be the case.

---------------

 Alternatively, the spin could change if the interaction involves some process that changes it. But the question doesn't specify, so maybe I

---------------

 should assume that the spin S remains the same. Alternatively, perhaps the spin isn't changing because the process conserves it.



---------------

Wait, but the problem gives the equation T = S + L +1 mod 2. So for the final state, T

---------------

=0, so S + L must be 1 mod 2.

So if the spin S of the final NN' state is S

---------------

' =0 (same as initial), then L' must be 1 mod 2. Because 0 + L' +1 ≡ 0 mod 2 → L' ≡ 1 mod 2. So L' is odd.

Alternatively

---------------

, if the spin S' changes, but I don't have information about that. Hmm, perhaps the spin S' of

---------------

 the NN' state is the same as the initial spin. Because the initial state is S=0, and in the absence

---------------

 of other information, maybe it remains 0.

Wait, but the initial state is 1S0, so S=0. The

---------------

 emitted particle X will have its own spin, but the NN' state's spin could be different. But without knowing the details

---------------

 of the interaction, perhaps the spin isn't changing, so S' =0.

But let's proceed with that assumption.

---------------

 So S' =0. Then L' must be 1 mod 2, because 0 + L' +1 ≡0 → L' ≡1 mod 2.

So L' must be odd:

---------------

 1, 3, 5, etc.

Now, from earlier, we have L_NN' ≡ l +1 mod 2. So L

---------------

' ≡ l +1 mod 2.

But L' must be odd. So:

l +1 ≡ 1 mod 2 → l ≡0 mod 2.

So l must be even.

So

---------------

 the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X must be even (l=0,2,4,...). But wait, the

---------------

 options have the emitted X in s, p, d, f states.

The letters correspond to l:

s → l=0 (

---------------

even)
p → l=1 (odd)
d → l=2 (even)
f → l=3 (odd)

So,

---------------

 from our condition, l must be even. So X must be emitted in s or d state.

So any options where X is emitted in p or f states

---------------

 (l=1 or 3, which are odd) would violate this condition.

So looking at the options:

Option A: X

---------------

 is p (l=1) → not allowed.

Option B: X is p → not allowed.

Option C: X is f (l=3) → not allowed.

Option D: X is s (l=0) → allowed.

Wait, but according

---------------

 to this, options A, B, and C would have l odd, which is not allowed. But the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the

---------------

 incorrect options are A, B, C, and D is allowed?

But wait, that can't be right. Because only

---------------

 one option is the answer. So perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the parity

---------------

 condition. Let me go back.

The parity condition: P_initial = P_final.

P_initial is 1 (since L_initial=0).

P_final is P_NN' * P_X * (-1)^l.

But

---------------

 what's P_X? The problem says X has intrinsic parity -1.

So P_final = P_NN' * (-1) * (-1)^l = P_NN' * (-1)^{l+1}.

Setting

---------------

 this equal to P_initial =1:

1 = P_NN' * (-1)^{l+1}.

So P_NN' = (-1)^{l+1}.

But P_NN' is (-

---------------

1)^{L_NN'}, so:

(-1)^{L_NN'} = (-1)^{l +1} → L_NN' = l +1 mod 2.

So L_NN' and

---------------

 l must have opposite parity. So if l is even, L_NN' is odd, and vice versa.

Earlier, I

---------------

 thought that L_NN' must be odd because S'=0 and T=0 requires S + L +1 ≡0 → 0 + L +1 ≡0 → L �

---------------

�1 mod2. So L' must be odd.

So from L_NN' = l +1 mod2 →

---------------

 since L' is odd, then l must be even (because l+1 is odd → l is even).

So l

---------------

 must be even. So the emitted X must have even l (s or d states).

Looking at the options:

Option A: X is p → l=1 → odd

---------------

 → not allowed.

Option B: X is p → not allowed.

Option C: X is f → l=3 → odd → not allowed.

Option D: X is s → l=0 → allowed.

So the

---------------

 only allowed option is D, the others are not allowed. But the question asks which partial wave is not permitted. So the

---------------

 answer would be the options where X is emitted in p or f.

But the options are A, B, C, D.

---------------

 So the correct answer is any of A, B, C, but the question is which is not permitted.

Wait, but the

---------------

 problem says which partial wave is not permitted. So among the options, options A, B, and C have l odd, which are

---------------

 not allowed. So all except D are not allowed. But the options can't all be invalid, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made

---------------

 a mistake in assuming S' is 0. Let me think again.

The initial state is S=0, but the

---------------

 final state's S' could be different. Because the emission of a particle could change the spin. So perhaps S' isn

---------------

't necessarily 0. So the equation T = S' + L' +1 mod2 must hold, with T=0.

So 0 = S' + L' +1 mod2 → S' + L' ≡1 mod2.

So

---------------

 S' and L' must be of opposite parity.

But then, the parity condition is L' = l +1 mod2.

So L

---------------

' = l+1 mod2.

So substituting into the equation:

S' + (l +1) ≡1 mod2 → S' + l ≡0 mod2.

So S' ≡ -l mod2 → S' ≡ l mod2.

So

---------------

 the spin S' of the final NN' state must have the same parity as l.

But what is the spin S' of the final state? The

---------------

 initial state has S=0. The spin can change based on the process. But without knowing the process, perhaps I can't

---------------

 determine S'.

Alternatively, perhaps the spin is determined by the conservation of angular momentum. So the total angular momentum J must be conserved.

---------------

 But that's getting more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem only requires considering the parity and the isospin condition, without

---------------

 considering the spin.

Hmm, perhaps another approach: for each option, check whether the parity condition holds and whether the isospin condition holds.

Let me go

---------------

 through each option.

Option A: 1S0 →7D1 + p.

So the emitted X is p → l=1.

The

---------------

 final NN' state is 7D1. Let's parse this term symbol.

7D1: (2S'+1) L'

---------------

 (J').

So 2S' +1 =7 → S'=3.

L' is D → L'=2.

J' is 1.

So,

---------------

 from the isospin condition: T = S' + L' +1 mod2.

T is 0 → 0 ≡3 +2 +1 mod2 → 3+2=5,

---------------

 +1=6 →6 mod2=0 → 0≡0. So condition holds.

Now parity condition:

P

---------------

_initial =1.

P_final = P_NN' * P_X * (-1)^l.

P_NN' is (-1)^L' = (-1)^2=1.

P_X is -1.

l=1.

So P_final =1 * (-1) * (-1)^1 = 1 * (-1) * (-1) = 1.



---------------

Which matches P_initial=1. So parity is conserved.

So option A is allowed.

Wait, but earlier analysis suggested that l

---------------

 must be even, but in this case l=1 (odd), but it seems to satisfy the parity condition. So my

---------------

 previous assumption that l must be even is incorrect.

Hmm, that's confusing. So perhaps my earlier approach was wrong.

Let me re

---------------

-examine the parity condition.

Parity of the initial state: +1.

Parity of the final state: P_NN' * P_X * (-1)^l.

So

---------------

 1 = P_NN' * (-1) * (-1)^l.

Which can be rewritten as 1 = P_NN' * (-1)^{l+1}.

Which

---------------

 implies P_NN' = (-1)^{l+1}.

But P_NN' is (-1)^L'.

So (-1)^L' = (-1)^{l+1}.

Which

---------------

 implies L' = l +1 mod2.

So L' and l must be opposite in parity.

So for each option, compute

---------------

 L' and l.

Let's do this for each option:

Option A: X is p (l=1, odd).



---------------

Final NN' state is 7D1 → L'=2 (even).

Check L' = l +1 mod2 →

---------------

 2 ≡1+1 → 2 ≡ 0 mod2. 2 mod2 is 0, 1+1=2 mod2 is 0. So 0≡0 → condition

---------------

 holds.

So this is allowed.

Option B: X is p (l=1, odd).

Final NN' state is 3S1 → S

---------------

'=1 (from 2S+1=3), L'=0 (S state).

So L' =0,

---------------

 even.

Check L' = l+1 mod2 → 0 ≡1+1 → 0≡0 → holds.

But

---------------

 also, the isospin condition: T=0 = S' + L' +1 mod2 → 0 ≡1 +0 +1 → 0 ≡2 mod2 → 0=0 → condition holds.

Par

---------------

ity:

P_NN' = (-1)^0=1.

P_final = 1 * (-1) * (-1)^1 = 1*(-1)*(-1)=1 → matches

---------------

 initial parity.

So option B is allowed.

Option C: X is f (l=3, odd).

Final NN' state is 3D3 → L

---------------

'=2 (even).

Check L' = l+1 mod2 → 2 ≡3+1 → 2 ≡4 → 2 mod2=0, 4 mod2=0 → holds.

Isospin condition: T=0 =

---------------

 S' + L' +1 mod2.

S' for 3D3: 2S+1=3 → S'=1.

So 0 =1 +2 +1 → 4 mod2=0 → holds

---------------

.

Parity:

P_NN' = (-1)^2=1.

P_final =1 * (-1) * (-1)^3 =1*(-1)*(-1)=1 → matches

---------------

 initial.

So option C is allowed.

Option D: X is s (l=0, even).

Final NN' state is 3P0 → L'=1 (odd).

Check L' = l+1 mod2 →1 ≡0+1 →1≡1 → holds.

Isospin condition: T=0 = S' + L' +1 mod2.

S' from 3P0: 2S+1=3 → S'=1.

So 0 =1 +1 +1 →3 mod2=1 → 0≡1? No. So

---------------

 this condition doesn't hold.

Wait, that's a problem. So the isospin condition isn't satisfied in option D.

So

---------------

 for option D:

S'=1, L'=1, T=0.

So 0 ≡1 +1 +1 →3

---------------

 mod2=1 → 0≡1 → which is false.

So the isospin condition is not satisfied for option D. Thus

---------------

, option D is not allowed.

But earlier, all the other options (A, B, C) satisfy both conditions. So

---------------

 the only one that doesn't satisfy the isospin condition is option D.

Wait, but why? Because in option D, the

---------------

 isospin equation doesn't hold.

So the question is, which partial wave is not permitted. The answer would be the one that doesn't satisfy either the isospin condition or the parity condition.

In

---------------

 this case, option D violates the isospin condition, so it's not permitted.

Wait, but earlier, when I

---------------

 thought that l must be even, but options A, B, C have l odd and were allowed. So perhaps the is

---------------

ospin condition is more restrictive.

So the answer is option D, because it doesn't satisfy T=0 condition.


To solve the problem, we analyze the conditions for conservation of angular momentum, parity, and the isospin relation provided: 

1. **Initial State**: The initial

---------------

 NN state is in the 1S0 configuration, which corresponds to \( S = 0 \), \( L = 0 \), and \( J = 0 \). The intrinsic parity of the initial state is \( P_{\text{initial}} = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1 \).

2. **Final State**: The final NN state has \( T = 0 \). The isospin relation given is:
   \[
   T = S + L + 1 \mod 2
   \]
   Substituting \( T = 0 \), we get:
   \[
   0 \equiv S + L + 1 \mod 2 \implies S + L \equiv 1 \mod 2
   \]
   This means \( S \) and \( L \) must have opposite parity.

3. **Parity Conservation**: The parity of the final state is given by:
   \[
   P_{\text{final}} = P_{\text{NN}} \cdot P_X \cdot (-1)^l
   \]
   where \( P_{\text{NN}} = (-1)^{L'} \) (parity of the final NN state), \( P_X = -1 \) (intrinsic parity of the emitted particle), and \( l \) is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle \( X \). Since parity is conserved:
   \[
   P_{\text{initial}} = P_{\text{final}} \implies 1 = (-1)^{L'} \cdot (-1) \cdot (-1)^l
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   (-1)^{L'} = (-1)^{l+1} \implies L' \equiv l + 1 \mod 2
   \]
   Thus, \( L' \) and \( l \) must have opposite parity.

4. **Analysis of Each Option**:
   - **Option A**: \( 1S0 \to 7D1 + p \)
     - Final NN state: \( 7D1 \), so \( S' = 3 \) (from \( 2S'+1 = 7 \)), \( L' = 2 \) (from \( D \)).
     - Emitted particle: \( p \), so \( l = 1 \) (odd).
     - Check isospin condition: \( T = S' + L' + 1 \mod 2 \):
       \[
       0 \equiv 3 + 2 + 1 \mod 2 \implies 0 \equiv 6 \mod 2 \implies 0 \equiv 0
       \]
       Condition holds.
     - Check parity condition: \( L' \equiv l + 1 \mod 2 \):
       \[
       2 \equiv 1 + 1 \mod 2 \implies 0 \equiv 0
       \]
       Condition holds.
     - **Allowed**.

   - **Option B**: \( 1S0 \to 3S1 + p \)
     - Final NN state: \( 3S1 \), so \( S' = 1 \) (from \( 2S'+1 = 3 \)), \( L' = 0 \) (from \( S \)).
     - Emitted particle: \( p \), so \( l = 1 \) (odd).
     - Check isospin condition: \( T = S' + L' + 1 \mod 2 \):
       \[
       0 \equiv 1 + 0 + 1 \mod 2 \implies 0 \equiv 2 \mod 2 \implies 0 \equiv 0
       \]
       Condition holds.
     - Check parity condition: \( L' \equiv l + 1 \mod 2 \):
       \[
       0 \equiv 1 + 1 \mod 2 \implies 0 \equiv 0
       \]
       Condition holds.
     - **Allowed**.

   - **Option C**: \( 1S0 \to 3D3 + f \)
     - Final NN state: \( 3D3 \), so \( S' = 1 \) (from \( 2S'+1 = 3 \)), \( L' = 2 \) (from \( D \)).
     - Emitted particle: \( f \), so \( l = 3 \) (odd).
     - Check isospin condition: \( T = S' + L' + 1 \mod 2 \):
       \[
       0 \equiv 1 + 2 + 1 \mod 2 \implies 0 \equiv 4 \mod 2 \implies 0 \equiv 0
       \]
       Condition holds.
     - Check parity condition: \( L' \equiv l + 1 \mod 2 \):
       \[
       2 \equiv 3 + 1 \mod 2 \implies 0 \equiv 0
       \]
       Condition holds.
     - **Allowed**.

   - **Option D**: \( 1S0 \to 3P0 + s \)
     - Final NN state: \( 3P0 \), so \( S' = 1 \) (from \( 2S'+1 = 3 \)), \( L' = 1 \) (from \( P \)).
     - Emitted particle: \( s \), so \( l = 0 \) (even).
     - Check isospin condition: \( T = S' + L' + 1 \mod 2 \):
       \[
       0 \equiv 1 + 1 + 1 \mod 2 \implies 0 \equiv 3 \mod 2 \implies 0 \equiv 1
       \]
       Condition does not hold.
     - **Not Allowed**.

5. **Conclusion**: The only partial wave that does not satisfy the isospin condition is **Option D**.
