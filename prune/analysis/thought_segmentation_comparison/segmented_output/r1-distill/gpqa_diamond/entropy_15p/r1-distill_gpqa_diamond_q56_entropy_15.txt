Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons, and I'm supposed to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, elastic scattering... I remember that in

---------------

 such processes, electrons scatter off nuclei, and their paths are deflected. The phase shifts are given, and I need to find

---------------

 the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.

Wait, the question gives me several phase shifts: δ₀ is 90 degrees, δ₁ is 67, δ₂ is 55, δ₃ is 30, and δ₄ is 13 degrees. Oh

---------------

, and I'm supposed to ignore the rest beyond δ₄. So I guess that means I'll only consider up to l=4,

---------------

 where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number.

I think the scattering amplitude f(θ) for electrons involves the sum over these phase shifts. The

---------------

 formula I remember is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum over l [ ( (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) ) * ( (

---------------

2l +1)/(l(l+1)) ) * ( (sin θ)^{2l} ) ) ]

---------------

 multiplied by some other factors. Wait, wait, maybe the imaginary part is just the imaginary component of each term in this sum. Oh

---------------

 right, because the amplitude f has a real and imaginary part. Since the question asks for the imaginary part along the beam direction, which is θ=0 degrees

---------------

. Oh wait, but wait: when θ is 0, sinθ is zero, so (sinθ)^{2l} would

---------------

 be zero except when l=0. Because any higher l would make that term zero.

So when θ is 0, the

---------------

 only non-zero term in the sum is for l=0. Because for l=0, (sinθ)^{0} is 1. So

---------------

 all other terms (l=1,2,3,4) would contribute nothing because sin0 is zero to any positive power. That

---------------

 simplifies things a lot.

So the imaginary part of f(0) would only come from the l=0 term. Let

---------------

 me think about the formula again. The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum [ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * ( (2l+1)/(l(l+1)) ) * (sinθ)^{2l} ) ]

But

---------------

 wait, for θ=0, sinθ is zero, so only l=0 term remains.

So for l=0, the

---------------

 term becomes (e^{2iδ₀} -1) * ( (2*0 +1)/(0*(0+1)) ) * 1. Wait

---------------

, but wait, 0*(0+1) is 0, so that's a division by zero. Oh,

---------------

 right! Because for l=0, the formula is a bit different. Because when l=0, the denominator becomes zero, but the

---------------

 numerator is 1. So perhaps that term is handled separately.

Wait, I think for l=0, the term is

---------------

 just (e^{2iδ₀} - 1), multiplied by 1/(2ik). Because the general formula for

---------------

 the amplitude is:

f(θ) = [ (e^{2iδ₀} - 1) ] / (2ik) + sum_{l=1}^∞ [ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) * (2l +1) * (sinθ)^{2l} ) ] / [ l(l+1) * (2ik) ) ]

So

---------------

 for θ=0, the sum from l=1 onwards is zero because of the (sinθ)^{2l} factor. So f(0) is just (e^{2iδ₀} -1)/(2ik).

Wait

---------------

, but I'm supposed to find the imaginary part of f along the beam direction, which is f(θ=0)

---------------

 but only the imaginary component.

So let's compute Im[f(0)]. So f(0) = [e^{2i δ₀} - 1 ] / (2ik)



---------------

First, compute e^{2i δ₀}. Since δ₀ is 90 degrees, which is π/2 radians. So 2δ₀ is π radians. So e^{iπ} is -1. So e^{2i δ₀} is e^{i π} = -1.

So [

---------------

e^{2i δ₀} -1] = (-1) -1 = -2.

So f(0) = (-2)/(2ik) = (-1)/(ik)

Now

---------------

, the imaginary part of f(0) is the coefficient of i in the expression when written in terms of real and imaginary parts. Let

---------------

's express 1/(ik) in terms of real and imaginary components.

Wait, 1/(ik) can be written as (1/i) * (1/k) = ( -i ) * (1/k ), since 1/i = -i.

So 1/(ik) = -i/(k).

---------------

 So f(0) = (-1) * (-i)/(k) ) = i/(k)

So f(0) = i/(k)



---------------

The imaginary part is the coefficient of i, which is 1/k.

Wait, but I'm supposed to compute the imaginary part.

---------------

 So Im[f(0)] = 1/k.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the units here. The problem

---------------

 states that the energy is 50 MeV. Wait, but what is k? The wave number k is given by k

---------------

 = sqrt(2mE)/(ħ). But wait, E is the kinetic energy. So let me compute k.

Wait

---------------

, the energy E is 50 MeV. Electrons have a rest mass of about 0.511 MeV/c². So

---------------

 when E is much larger than the rest mass, we can approximate E ≈ (ħ²k²)/(2m). So

---------------

 k ≈ sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

Wait, m is the mass of the electron, which is 9.10938356 × 10^-31 kg. Let

---------------

 me compute k.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to compute k in atomic units or using some standard formula.

Wait, but

---------------

 in natural units where ħ = c = 1, but perhaps I should use the formula for k in terms of the

---------------

 energy.

Wait, the kinetic energy E is 50 MeV. The rest mass energy of the electron is m c² = 0.511 MeV. So E

---------------

 is much larger than m c², so relativistic effects are important, but perhaps for the purpose of this problem, we

---------------

 can approximate using the non-relativistic formula.

Wait, but the non-relativistic formula is k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

Wait

---------------

, let's compute E in Joules. 1 eV is 1.60218 × 10^-19 J. So 50 MeV is 50 × 10^6 eV =

---------------

 5e7 eV.

E = 5e7 eV * 1.60218e-19 J/eV = 8.0109e-12 J.

m

---------------

 is 9.10938356e-31 kg.

So k = sqrt(2mE) / ħ.

Wait

---------------

, ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So compute numerator: sqrt(2 * 9.10938356e-31 kg * 8.0109e-12 J )



---------------

Compute 2mE: 2 * 9.10938e-31 * 8.0109e-12 = ?



---------------

9.10938e-31 *8.0109e-12 = approx 7.298

---------------

e-42 kg·J.

Wait, 2 * 7.298e-42 = 1.4596e-41.

sqrt

---------------

(1.4596e-41) = sqrt(1.4596) * 1e-20.5 �

---------------

� 1.208e-20.5. Wait, 1e-41 is (1e-20.5)^2. So sqrt(1.4596e-41) ≈ 1.208e-20.5 m

---------------

^-1? Wait, no, sqrt(kg·J) is kg^0.5 * J^0.5. Hmm

---------------

, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, J is kg·m²/s². So 2mE has units kg * kg·m²/s² = kg²·m²/s². So

---------------

 sqrt(2mE) is kg·m/s. So when you divide by ħ (J·s), which is kg·m²/s, then

---------------

 k has units 1/m.

Wait, let's proceed numerically.

Compute sqrt(2 * m * E) =

---------------

 sqrt(2 * 9.10938e-31 kg * 8.0109e-12 J )



---------------

So 2 *9.10938e-31 = 1.821876e-30 kg.

Multiply by 8.0109e-12 J: 1.821876e-30 *8.0109e-12 = 

---------------

1.460e-41 kg·J.

Wait, but J is kg·m²/s², so kg

---------------

·J is kg^2·m²/s².

So sqrt(1.46e-41 kg²·m²/s²) = sqrt(1.46e-41) kg·m/s.

sqrt(1.46e-41) = approx

---------------

 3.82e-21 kg·m/s.

So sqrt(2mE) = 3.82e-21 kg·m/s.

Divide by ħ (

---------------

1.05457e-34 J·s = 1.05457e-34 kg·m²/s).



---------------

So k = (3.82e-21 kg·m/s) / (1.05457e-34 kg·m²/s) ) 

Wait

---------------

, let's compute that: numerator is 3.82e-21, denominator is 1.05457e-34.

Dividing gives

---------------

 (3.82e-21)/(1.05457e-34) ) ≈ (3.82 /1.05457 ) * 1e13 �

---------------

� 3.62 *1e13 m^-1.

Wait, 3.62e13 m^-1 is

---------------

 a very large k. Wait, but 50 MeV is a high energy, so high k makes sense.

Wait, but wait

---------------

, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, another approach: I can use the relation k

---------------

 = (sqrt(2mE)) / ħ.

But E is in Joules.

E = 50 MeV = 50e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 = 8.01e-12 J.

m is 9.109e-31 kg.

So sqrt

---------------

(2mE) = sqrt(2 * 9.109e-31 * 8.01e-12 )



---------------

Calculate 2 *9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30.

1.8218e-30 *8.01e-12 = 1.8218e-30 *8.01e-12 = (

---------------

1.8218 *8.01) e-42 = approx 14.596

---------------

e-42 = 1.4596e-41.

sqrt(1.4596e-41) = sqrt(1.4596) * 1e-20.5 =

---------------

 approx 1.208 * 1e-20.5. Since 1e-20.5 is sqrt

---------------

(1e-41), which is 1e-20.5. So sqrt(1.4596e-41) ≈ 1.208e-20.5 m

---------------

^-0.5?

Wait, maybe I'm getting the exponents wrong. Let me compute sqrt(1e-41) as

---------------

 1e-20.5. So sqrt(1.4596e-41) = sqrt(1.4596) * 1e-20.5 = 

---------------

1.208 * 1e-20.5 = 1.208e-20.5.



---------------

But 1e-20.5 is 3.16e-21. So 1.208 *3.16e-21 ≈ 3.815

---------------

e-21 m^-0.5?

Wait, no, wait. The units of sqrt(2mE) are

---------------

 sqrt( kg * J ), and J is kg m²/s². So sqrt( kg * kg m²/s² ) = sqrt(kg² m²/s² ) = kg m / s. So the

---------------

 units are kg m/s.

Then, when you divide by ħ (which is kg m²/s), you get (kg m/s) / (kg m²/s) ) = 1/(m), so units of k

---------------

 are 1/m. So yeah, the calculation gives k ≈ 3.62e13 m^-1.

Wait, but

---------------

 3.62e13 m^-1 is 3.62e13 per meter, which is 3.62e19 per

---------------

 femtometer (since 1 m = 1e15 fm). Because 1 fm is 1e-15 m. So 1/m is 1e15 fm^-1. So 3.62e13 m^-1 = 3.62e13 * 1e15 fm^-1 = 3.62e28 fm^-1? That can't be right because

---------------

 the options are in the order of 1e5 fm. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I messed up the exponents. Let me recompute:

sqrt(2mE) = sqrt(2 * 9.10938e-31 kg * 8.01e-12 J )



---------------

= sqrt( 2 * 9.10938e-31 * 8.01e-12 ) 

Compute

---------------

 2 *9.10938e-31 = 1.821876e-30.

Multiply by 8.01e-12: 1.821876e-30 *8.01e-12 = 

---------------

1.821876 *8.01 = approx 14.6, and exponents:

---------------

 e-30 *e-12 = e-42.

So 14.6e-42 = 1.46e-41.

sqrt

---------------

(1.46e-41) = sqrt(1.46) * sqrt(1e-41) ≈ 1.208 * 1e-20.5.

But

---------------

 1e-20.5 is approximately 3.16e-21. So 1.208 *3.16e-21 = approx

---------------

 3.81e-21.

So sqrt(2mE) ≈ 3.81e-21 kg·m/s.

Now, ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s, which is 1.0545718e-34 kg·m²/s.

So k = (3.81e-21 kg·m/s ) / (1.0545718e-34 kg·m²/s )

Div

---------------

iding these, the kg cancels, m/s divided by m²/s is 1/m.

So (3.81e-21) / (1.0545718e-34) ) = (3.81 / 1.0545718) ) * 1e13.



---------------

3.81 / 1.0545718 ≈ 3.61.

So k ≈ 3.61e13 m^-1.

Wait

---------------

, but 3.61e13 m^-1 is 3.61e13 / (1e15 fm) ) because

---------------

 1 m = 1e15 fm. So 3.61e13 /1e15 = 3.61e-2 fm^-1. Wait

---------------

, that doesn't make sense because the options are in the order of 1e5 fm.

Wait, perhaps I made

---------------

 a mistake in the units somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should compute k in terms of inverse femtometers because

---------------

 the options are given in fm. So 1 fm is 1e-15 meters. So 1 m is 1e15 fm. So 1 m^-1 is 1e-15 fm^-1.

So 

---------------

3.61e13 m^-1 = 3.61e13 * 1e-15 fm^-1 = 3.61e-2 fm^-1.

Wait

---------------

, that's 0.0361 fm^-1. But that's a very small number. Hmm, but

---------------

 that can't be right because the options are on the order of 1e5 fm. So maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I should have used the relativistic formula for k. Because 50 MeV is much larger than the rest mass energy of the electron (0.511 MeV), so the

---------------

 non-relativistic formula isn't accurate. Let me try using the relativistic energy relation.

The relativistic energy is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) - m c^2.

---------------

 But perhaps for high energies, E ≈ pc. So p ≈ E/c.

Wait, but for electrons, the

---------------

 momentum p is given by sqrt(2 m E) when E is much larger than m c^2, but maybe the

---------------

 relativistic approach would give a better approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation k = p/ħ, where p is the momentum.

If

---------------

 E is much larger than m c², then E ≈ pc, so p ≈ E/(c).

Wait, let

---------------

 me compute p = E/(c), and then k = p/ħ.

E is 50 MeV. Let

---------------

 me convert E into Joules again.

E = 50e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 8.01e-12 J.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So p = E/(c) = 8.01e-12 J / 3e8 m/s.

J is kg·m²/s², so J

---------------

/(m/s) )= kg·m/s. So p = (8.01e-12) / (3e8) ) kg·m/s.

=

---------------

 2.67e-20 kg·m/s.

Then, k = p/ħ = (2.67e-20 kg·m/s) / (1.0545718e-34 J·s )



---------------

Wait, J·s is kg·m²/s, so (kg·m/s) / (kg·m²/s) ) = 1/m.

So (

---------------

2.67e-20) / (1.0545718e-34) ) = 

---------------

2.53e14 m^-1.

Convert m^-1 to fm^-1: 1 m^-1 = 1e15 fm^-1. So 2.53e14 m^-1 = 2.53e14 * 1e15 fm^-1 = 2.53e29 fm^-1. Wait

---------------

, that's even worse. Hmm, but that can't be right because the options are in the hundreds of fm. So

---------------

 perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I should use the relation between the scattering amplitude and the phase

---------------

 shifts. Since the imaginary part of f(0) is 1/(k), but wait, no, earlier I found

---------------

 f(0) = i/(k), so Im[f(0)] is 1/k.

Wait, but in the

---------------

 calculation, k was 3.6e13 m^-1, which is 3.6e13 per

---------------

 meter, which is 3.6e13 * 1e-15 fm^-1 = 3.6e-2 fm^-1. So 1/k is 

---------------

1/(3.6e-2 fm^-1) ) = (1/0.036 ) fm ≈ 27.78 fm.

But the

---------------

 options are in the hundreds of fm. So that's not matching any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula

---------------

 for the scattering amplitude.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the formula for the scattering amplitude. I'm a bit confused about

---------------

 the exact expression. Let me recall.

The scattering amplitude f(θ) for spinless particles is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum

---------------

_{l=0}^∞ ( (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) ) * (2l + 1) * (sin θ)^{2l} ) / ( l (l+1) )

But

---------------

 when θ=0, sinθ is zero, so all terms with l≥1 vanish, and only l=0 remains. For

---------------

 l=0, the denominator is 0, but the term is taken as a limit. So the l=0 term becomes (e^{2iδ_0} -1 ) / (2ik).



---------------

Wait, that's correct. So for l=0, the term is (e^{2iδ_0} -1) / (2ik).



---------------

So then f(0) = (e^{2i δ_0} -1) / (2ik )

As

---------------

 I computed earlier, when δ₀ is 90 degrees, e^{2i δ₀} is e^{i π} = -1. So [

---------------

 -1 -1 ] = -2.

So f(0) = (-2)/(2ik) = -1/(ik).



---------------

Which is the same as i/(k), because 1/(ik) = -i/(k^2) ? Wait, no

---------------

. Wait, 1/(ik) can be written as (1/i) * (1/k) ) = (-i) * (1/k).



---------------

Wait, 1/i = -i, because i*(-i) = 1.

So 1/(ik) = (1/k) * (1/i) )= (1/k)* (-i)

---------------

 ) = -i/(k).

So f(0) = (-1) * (-i/(k) ) = i/(k).

So the imaginary part of f(0) is (

---------------

1/k ), because i/(k) = 0 + i*(1/k), so Im[f(0)] = 1/k.

Wait

---------------

, but then 1/k is in units of fm, because k is 1/fm. Wait, no, because

---------------

 earlier I calculated k as 3.6e13 m^-1, which is 3.6e13 per meter, which is 3.6e13 * 1e-15 per femtometer,

---------------

 which is 3.6e-2 per femtometer, so 1/k is (1/(3.6e-2 per fm )) ) = (1/(3.6e-2 )) fm �

---------------

� 27.78 fm.

But the options are much larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use

---------------

 the relation between the scattering amplitude and the cross-section, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Maybe

---------------

 the imaginary part of f is related to the total cross-section. The total cross-section σ_total is given by 4π |f|^2,

---------------

 but wait, no, that's for the differential cross-section.

Wait, but the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 might have

---------------

 a physical meaning, such as the total absorption or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is

---------------

 different. Wait, perhaps the formula is f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) ) * ( (2l+1)/(2l(l+1)) ) * (sin θ)^{2l} )

Wait, that

---------------

 might be the case. Because I've seen different forms of the scattering amplitude, sometimes with a factor of (2l+1)/(2l(l+1)).



---------------

Wait, let me recheck. The general form is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l} (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) (sinθ)^{2l} / ( l (l+1) ) )

Hmm

---------------

, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l} ( (e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) ( (2l+1)/(2l(l+1)) ) ) (sinθ)^{2l} )

So

---------------

 if that's the case, then for θ=0, only l=0 term remains.

So for l=0, (sinθ)^{0}=1, and (2l+1)/(2l(l+1)) )

---------------

 becomes 1/(0*(1)) ), which is undefined. So perhaps that formula is not correct for l=0.

Wait

---------------

, perhaps the correct expression is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (e^{2iδ_l} -1) ) * ( (2l+1)/(l(l+1)) ) ) (sinθ)^{2l} )

But

---------------

 for l=0, this becomes (e^{2iδ_0} -1) * (1/(0*(

---------------

1)) ), which is undefined. So perhaps the l=0 term is treated separately.

Wait, perhaps the correct expression is f(θ) = (e^{2iδ_0} -1)/(2ik) + sum_{l=1}^∞ [ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) (sinθ)^{2l} ] / [ 2k l (l+1) ) ]

In

---------------

 that case, for θ=0, only the l=0 term remains.

So f(0) = (e^{2iδ_0} -1)/(2ik )



---------------

Which brings us back to the same conclusion as before.

So Im[f(0)] = 1/k.

But earlier,

---------------

 my calculation of k gave me Im[f(0)] ≈ 27.78 fm, but the options are much

---------------

 larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different approach to compute k. Let

---------------

 me think about the relation between the energy and the wavelength.

The electron's energy is 50 MeV. The De

---------------

 Broglie wavelength λ is given by λ = h / p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum.

But

---------------

 since E = p²/(2m) (non-relativistic approximation), so p = sqrt(2 m E ),

---------------

 and λ = h / p = h / sqrt(2 m E )

h is Planck's constant, 6.62607015e-34 J·s.

m

---------------

 is 9.10938356e-31 kg.

E is 50 MeV = 50e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 8.01e-12 J.

So p

---------------

 = sqrt(2 * 9.10938e-31 kg * 8.01e-12 J ) = sqrt( 2 * 9.10938e-31 *8.01e-12 )

Compute

---------------

 2 *9.10938e-31 = 1.821876e-30.

Multiply by 8.01e-12: 1.821876e-30 *8.01e-12 = 1.4596e-41.

sqrt(1.4596e-41) = approx 3.82e-21 kg·m/s.

So p = 3.82e-21 kg·m/s.

Then λ = h / p = 6.626e-34 / 3.82e-21 = approx 1.734e-13 meters.

Which is 1.734e-13 m = 173.4 fm.

So

---------------

 k = 2π / λ = 2π / (1.734e-13 m) ≈ 3.64

---------------

e13 m^-1.

Wait, that's consistent with the earlier calculation. So 1/k = 1/(3.64e13 m^-1 ) = 2.747e-14 meters.



---------------

Convert meters to femtometers: 1 m = 1e15 fm. So 2.747e-14 m = 2.747e-14 * 1e15 fm = 27.47 fm.

But

---------------

 the options are in the range of hundreds of fm. So I'm getting 27 fm, but the closest option is C) 177.675 fm,

---------------

 which is about 6.5 times larger. Hmm, but that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts include

---------------

 other terms beyond l=4, but the problem says to ignore the rest beyond δ₄. So I'm only considering up to l=4. But for

---------------

 θ=0, only l=0 contributes. So the phase shifts beyond l=0 don't affect the result.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the imaginary part of the amplitude in terms of the imaginary unit times some factor. Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for f(0). Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The

---------------

 imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by the optical theorem, which relates the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude to the total cross-section. The optical theorem says that Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) * σ_total.

But I

---------------

 don't know the total cross-section here. But perhaps the scattering amplitude's imaginary part can be calculated using the given phase shifts.



---------------

Wait, but earlier we determined that for θ=0, only the l=0 phase shift contributes. So the imaginary

---------------

 part of f(0) is (1/k) because f(0) = i/(k).

But according to the

---------------

 calculation, that's about 27 fm, but none of the options match this. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I should re-express k in terms of energy in a different way. Let's try using the relation k = (sqrt

---------------

(2mE)) / ħ.

E =50 MeV =50e6 eV.

But 

---------------

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So E=50e6 *1.602e-19 =8.01e-12 J.

m=9.10938356e-31 kg.

So

---------------

 sqrt(2mE)=sqrt(2*9.10938356e-31 *8.01e-12 )

---------------

=sqrt(1.4596e-41)=3.82e-21 kg m/s.

k

---------------

=3.82e-21/(1.0545718e-34 )=3

---------------

.62e13 m^-1.

So 1/k=2.76e-14 m=27.6 fm.

Wait

---------------

, but the options are way larger. So perhaps the mistake is in the initial assumption. Maybe the formula for the imaginary part is

---------------

 different.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is different. I've heard that for spin-½ particles, the scattering amplitude involves

---------------

 more terms, but the problem states that it's about electrons, which are spin-½. But perhaps in this problem, we

---------------

're treating them as spinless for simplicity.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part of f(θ) is given by the sum of the phase

---------------

 shifts. Wait, but that doesn't sound right.

Wait, another thought: The scattering amplitude's imaginary part at θ=0 is given

---------------

 by (1/k) sum ( sin(2δ_l) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the

---------------

 sum of sin(δ_l) for each l.

Wait, but earlier I thought that only l=0 contributes, so

---------------

 the sum would be sin(δ_0). But δ_0 is 90 degrees, sin(90) is 1. So (

---------------

1/k) *1= 27.6 fm.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm

---------------

 missing a factor.

Wait, maybe the formula for the imaginary part of f(θ) is (1/k) sum_{

---------------

l=0}^∞ sin(2δ_l) * ( (2l+1)/(2l(l+1)) ) * (sinθ)^{2l} )

Wait

---------------

, but again, for θ=0, only l=0 would contribute, giving (1/k) sin(2δ_0) * (1/(0*1)) ), which is undefined. So that can

---------------

't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ sin(2δ_l) * (2l+1)/(l(l+1)) )

But for

---------------

 l=0, that term is undefined. So perhaps it's only the sum from l=1.

But that can't be right

---------------

 because for θ=0, only l=0 contributes, so perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0)) = (1/k) sin

---------------

(2δ_0).

Because, when l=0, the term is (e^{2iδ_0} -1 )/(2ik ),

---------------

 which is ( (cos(2δ_0) + i sin(2δ_0)) -1 )/(2ik )

Which

---------------

 simplifies to ( (cos(2δ_0) -1) + i sin(2δ_0) )/(2ik )

The imaginary part is [ sin(2δ_0) ]/(2k )

So

---------------

 Im(f(0)) = [ sin(2δ_0) ]/(2k )

Wait, earlier I thought it

---------------

 was 1/k, but perhaps it's [ sin(2δ_0) ]/(2k )

Ah, I

---------------

 think I made a mistake earlier. Because, let's compute f(0) again.

f(0) = (e^{2iδ_0} -1 )/(2ik )

Which

---------------

 is [ (cos(2δ_0) + i sin(2δ_0)) -1 ] / (2ik )

= [ (cos(2δ_0) -1) + i sin(2δ_0) ] / (2ik )

The

---------------

 imaginary part is [ sin(2δ_0) ] / (2k )

So Im(f(0)) = [ sin(2δ_0) ] / (2k )

Ah

---------------

! So I missed a factor of 2 earlier. So the correct expression is Im(f(0)) = sin(2δ_0)/(2k )

So

---------------

 now, let's compute this.

δ_0 is 90 degrees. So 2δ_0 is 180 degrees.

sin(180 degrees) is 0. So Im(f(0)) would

---------------

 be zero. But that's not possible because the options don't include zero.

Wait, this can't be right because in

---------------

 the earlier approach, we found Im(f(0)) = 1/k, but with the correct analysis, it's sin(2δ_0)/(2k )



---------------

Wait, so when δ_0 is 90 degrees, 2δ_0 is 180 degrees, sin

---------------

(180)=0. So the imaginary part is zero. But that's not matching the options.

Hmm, this

---------------

 is confusing. I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: Maybe the correct formula for the imaginary part of f(0) is (

---------------

1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (sin δ_l) ) * ( (2l+1)/(2l(l+1)) ) )

But for

---------------

 θ=0, only l=0 contributes, which is undefined. So perhaps this isn't the right formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct

---------------

 formula is Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ sin(2δ_l) * ( (2l+1)/(l(l+1)) ) )

But

---------------

 for l=0, this would be sin(2δ_0) * (1/(0*1)) ), which is undefined. So perhaps

---------------

 the correct formula is only for l≥1.

But then, for θ=0, the sum would be zero because

---------------

 (sinθ)^{2l} is zero. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact

---------------

 formula for the scattering amplitude in elastic scattering. From what I recall, the scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) ) * ( (2l +1)/(l(l+1)) ) ) (sinθ)^{2l} )

So

---------------

 for θ=0, only l=0 term remains. But for l=0, (2l+1)/(l(l+1)) ) is 1/(0*1) which

---------------

 is infinity. So perhaps the l=0 term is treated separately.

Wait, perhaps the correct expression for l=0 is f

---------------

(0) = (e^{2iδ_0} - 1 )/(2ik )

Which is the same as earlier

---------------

.

So f(0) = (e^{i π} -1 )/(2ik ) = (-1 -1 )/(2ik ) = (-2)/(2ik ) = (-1)/(ik )

Which

---------------

 is (i)/(k ), because 1/(ik ) = -i/(k^2 )? Wait, no,

---------------

 1/(ik) = (1/i) * (1/k ) = (-i) * (1/k )

So f(0) = (-1) * ( -i/k

---------------

 ) ) = i/(k )

So Im(f(0)) = 1/k.

Earlier, I computed 1/k as approximately

---------------

 27.6 fm.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I should compute k using the relativistic relation. Let me try that.

The relativistic energy is E = gamma m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma

---------------

 = E/(m c² ). For E =50 MeV, m c²=0.511 MeV. So gamma =50 / 0.511 ≈97.8.



---------------

The momentum p is gamma m v, where v is the velocity. For relativistic speeds, v ≈ c. So p ≈ gamma m c.

m

---------------

 c is 9.10938e-31 kg *3e8 m/s =2.7328e-22 kg·m/s.

p

---------------

 ≈ gamma * m c =97.8 * 2.7328e-22 ≈2.672

---------------

e-20 kg·m/s.

k = p/ħ =2.672e-20 /1.05457e-34 ≈2.534e14 m^-1.

So

---------------

 1/k =3.95e-15 meters =39.5 fm.

Hmm, that's about

---------------

 39.5 fm, which is closer to option C (177.675 fm) but still not matching.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I should compute k in terms of the Compton wavelength.

The Compton wavelength λ_c = h/(m c) = (6.626e-34 J·s)/(9.109e-31 kg *3e8 m/s )=

---------------

 (6.626e-34)/(2.7327e-22 )=2.426e-12 m=24.26 fm.

So

---------------

 k = 2π/λ = 2π/(24.26e-15 m )=2

---------------

.58e13 m^-1.

Then 1/k=3.88e-14 m=38.8 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the mistake is that the problem is asking for the scattering amplitude's imaginary part multiplied by some factor. For example, maybe it's Im

---------------

(f) multiplied by 4π.

Wait, the differential cross-section is |f(θ)|^2, but the

---------------

 problem is about the scattering amplitude, not the cross-section.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the imaginary part in units of inverse

---------------

 femtometers, but when I calculated 1/k, I got 27.6 fm, which is 27.6 fm⁻

---------------

¹? No, that's not right.

Wait, no, 1/k is in meters, which is 27.6 fm.

---------------

 So if Im(f(0)) = 1/k, then it's 27.6 fm.

But the options don't include that. So perhaps I made

---------------

 a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for Im(f(0)) is sum_{l=0}^∞ [ sin(δ_l) * (2l+1)/(2l(l+1)) ) ]

But for θ=0, only l=0 contributes, which would be

---------------

 [ sin(δ_0) * (1) ]/(0*1*2 ), which is undefined. So that

---------------

's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0)) = sum_{l=0}^∞ [ sin(2δ_l) * (2l+1)/(2l(l+1)) ) ] *

---------------

 (1/k )

But for l=0, that would be sin(180) which is zero, so no

---------------

 contribution. Then, the sum starts from l=1. But for θ=0, other terms vanish, so this

---------------

 approach doesn't work.

I'm stuck. Let me try to look for another approach. Perhaps the given phase shifts are for

---------------

 partial waves, and I need to sum them up in some way.

Wait, but for θ=0, only l=0 contributes, so the

---------------

 sum is just l=0. So the imaginary part is [ sin(2δ_0) ]/(2k )

But

---------------

 δ_0 is 90 degrees, so sin(180) is zero. So Im(f(0)) is zero. But the options don't include zero. So that

---------------

 can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the formula is Im(f) = sum [ ( sin

---------------

(δ_l) ) * ( (2l+1)/(2l(l+1)) ) ) ] * (1/k )

But

---------------

 then for l=0, (2l+1)/(2l(l+1)) ) is (1)/(0*

---------------

1*2 )= undefined. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum [ ( sin(δ_l) ) * ( (2l+1)/(l(l+1)) ) ) ] * (1/(2k) )

For

---------------

 l=0, (2l+1)/(l(l+1)) )=1/(0*1)=infinite. So again

---------------

, not possible.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for the answer in the options that matches 27.6 fm. But the options don't have that. The

---------------

 closest is option C) 177.675 fm, which is about 6.4 times larger.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me recheck the calculation.

E=50 MeV=50e6 eV *

---------------

1.602e-19 J/eV=8.01e-12 J.

m=9.10938356e-31 kg.

k

---------------

= sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

sqrt(2mE)=sqrt(2 *9.10938e-31 *8.01e-12 )=sqrt(1.4596e-41)=3.82e-21 kg·m/s.

k=3.82e-21 /1.05457e-34=3.62e13 m^-1.

1/k=2.76e-14 m=27.6 fm.

So

---------------

 I think the calculation is correct. So the answer should be approximately 27.6 fm, but none of the options match.

Wait, looking

---------------

 back at the question, the phase shifts are given as δ_0=90 degrees, δ_1=67, etc. But

---------------

 I only considered δ_0. So perhaps the problem expects the sum of the phase shifts, but no, for θ=0, only l=0 contributes.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the formula is different. Maybe the imaginary part is the sum of the phase shifts multiplied by some factors.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula

---------------

 is Im(f) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ ( sin(δ_l) ) * (2l+1)/(2l(l+1)) )

But for l=0, this

---------------

 is (sin(90)) * (1) / (0) which is undefined. So no.

Another thought: Perhaps

---------------

 the formula for the scattering amplitude in the optical model includes the real and imaginary parts as Re(f) = sum (e^{2iδ_l} -1 )/(

---------------

2ik) and Im(f) = sum ( (2l+1)/(2k l(l+1)) ) * sin(2δ_l) *

---------------

 (sinθ)^{2l} )

But for θ=0, only l=0 term remains, which is

---------------

 undefined. So perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps the imaginary part of f(0) is given by (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ sin(2δ_l) * (2l+1)/(l(l+1)) )

But for l=0, this

---------------

 becomes sin(180)/something which is zero. So again, no contribution.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe

---------------

 I should go with the calculation I have, which gives approximately 27.6 fm, and see if any option is close. But the options don't have that.

Wait, looking

---------------

 at the options:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Hmm

---------------

, option C is approximately 177.675 fm, which is about 6.4 times my calculated value. Could

---------------

 I have missed a factor of 2 somewhere?

Wait, in the formula for Im(f(0)), I have Im(f(0)) = [ sin(2δ_0) ]/(2k )

But

---------------

 for δ_0=90 degrees, sin(180)=0. So Im(f(0))=0. But that's not possible

---------------

.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used δ_0=45 degrees, but no, the question states δ_0=90 degrees.

Wait, perhaps the correct

---------------

 formula is Im(f(0)) = [ (e^{2iδ_0} -1 )/(2ik ) ] *

---------------

 i.

Wait, because f(0) = (e^{2iδ_0} -1 )/(2ik ), and the

---------------

 imaginary part is the coefficient of i.

Which would be [ (e^{2iδ_0} -1 )/(2ik ) ] = (

---------------

cos(2δ_0) -1 + i sin(2δ_0) )/(2ik )

So the imaginary part is sin(2δ_0)/(2k )

Which

---------------

 for δ_0=90 degrees, sin(180)=0, so Im(f(0))=0.

But the options don't have zero. So perhaps

---------------

 I made a mistake in the initial formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is different. I found a reference that says the

---------------

 scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (e^{2iδ_l} -1) ) * (2l +1)/(l(l+1)) ) * (sinθ)^{2l}

So

---------------

 for θ=0, only l=0 term remains, which is (e^{2iδ_0} -1 )/(2ik )

So

---------------

 f(0)= (e^{2iδ_0} -1 )/(2ik )

Which is (cos(2δ_0) +i sin(2δ_0) -1 )/(2ik )

The

---------------

 imaginary part is [ sin(2δ_0) ]/(2k )

But δ_0=90 degrees, so sin(180)=0, Im

---------------

(f(0))=0.

But this can't be right because the options don't have zero. So perhaps the mistake

---------------

 is that δ_0 is not 90 degrees, but perhaps it's given in another way.

Wait, the problem states δ

---------------

_0=90 degrees, which is correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is zero, but it's not among the options. So

---------------

 I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the forward scattering direction but another angle, but the question says

---------------

 along the incident beam direction, which is θ=0.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a

---------------

 different approach.

Wait, perhaps the given phase shifts are not for the same l as I'm considering. For example, δ

---------------

_0 is for l=0, δ_1 for l=1, etc. So in the sum, each term contributes

---------------

 to a different angular momentum state.

But for θ=0, only the l=0 term contributes. So I'm

---------------

 back to the same conclusion.

Another thought: Perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is different, and the imaginary part is the

---------------

 sum of the phase shifts multiplied by some factors.

Wait, perhaps the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/k) times

---------------

 the sum of all δ_l. But that would be (1/k) * sum δ_l, but that seems unlikely.

But

---------------

 let's try: sum δ_l from l=0 to 4: 90 +67 +55 +30 +13 = 255 degrees.

So

---------------

 (1/k)*255*(π/180) [convert degrees to radians] → 255*(0.01745) ≈4.44 radians.

But

---------------

 1/k is 27.6 fm, so 27.6 *4.44 ≈121.3

---------------

 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is (sum (sin δ_l )) * (1/k )

Sum sin δ_l:

---------------

 sin(90)=1, sin(67)=0.92, sin(55)=0.82, sin(30)=0.5, sin(13)=0.225.

Sum:

---------------

 1+0.92=1.92, +0.82=2.74, +0.5=3.24, +0.225=3.465.

So

---------------

 3.465 * (1/k )=3.465 *27.6 fm ≈95.4

---------------

 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (1/(2k)) sum ( (

---------------

2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ) )

For l=0 to 4.

So compute for each l:

l=0: (1) * sin(180)=0.

l=1:3 * sin(134)=3*sin(134)=

---------------

3*(0.6947)=2.084.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5*(0.9397)=4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7*(0.8660)=6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9*(0.4384)=3.9456.

Sum these

---------------

: 0 +2.084 +4.6985 +6.062 +3.9456 �

---------------

�16.789.

Multiply by (1/(2k )) → 16.789/(2*3.62e13 m^-1 )=16.789/(7.24e13 )=2.316e-13 m=

---------------

23.16 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (1/k) sum ( (2l+1) sin(δ_l) )

For

---------------

 l=0 to 4.

Compute each term:

l=0:1 * sin(90)=1*1=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)=3*0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5*0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9*0.22495≈2.0245.

Sum:1+2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.0245=13.382.

Multiply by (1/k )=27.6 fm →

---------------

 13.382 *27.6 ≈368 fm.

But that's not an option either.

I

---------------

 think I'm stuck and not making progress. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options

---------------

 provided. My earlier calculation suggested approximately 27.6 fm, but that's not an option. The closest option is C) 177.675 fm, which is about 6.4 times larger. Perhaps

---------------

 I missed a factor of 2 or another factor somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the formula includes a factor of 2 from the spin

---------------

, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for Im(f(0)) is (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ sin(δ_l)

---------------

 * (2l+1)/(2l(l+1)) )

But for l=0, this is undefined. So perhaps the

---------------

 sum starts from l=1.

Compute for l=1 to 4:

l=1: (3)/(2*1*2) )=3/(4)=0.75.

---------------

 sin(67)=0.9205. 0.75 *0.9205≈0.690.

l=2:5/(2*2*3)=5/12≈0.4167. sin(55)=0.8192. 0.4167 *0.8192≈0.340.



---------------

l=3:7/(2*3*4)=7/24≈0.2917. sin(30)=0.5. 0.2917 *0.5≈0.1458.

l=4:9/(2*4*5)=9/40=0.225. sin(13)=0.22495. 0.225 *0.22495≈0.0507.

Sum:0.690 +0.340=1.03 +0.1458=1.1758 +0.0507≈1.2265.

Multiply by (1/k )=27.6 fm → 1.2265 *27.6 ≈33.75

---------------

 fm.

Still not matching any option.

At this point, I think I must have made a mistake in the approach, but I can't figure it out. I

---------------

'll have to go with the initial calculation, which was approximately 27.6 fm, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm, which is exactly

---------------

 6.44 times my calculated value. Maybe I missed a factor of 6.44 somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the correct

---------------

 answer is option C.


To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, we analyze the given phase shifts $\delta_0 = 90^\circ$, $\delta_1 = 67^\circ$, $\delta_2 = 55^\circ$, $\delta_3 = 30^\circ$, and $\delta_4 = 13^\circ$. The scattering amplitude $f(\theta)$ is expressed as:

\[
f(\theta) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^\infty \left( e^{2i\delta_l} - 1 \right) \frac{(2l+1)}{l(l+1)} (\sin\theta)^{2l}.
\]

For $\theta = 0$, only the $l=0$ term contributes because $(\sin\theta)^{2l} = 0$ for $l \geq 1$. The $l=0$ term simplifies to:

\[
f(0) = \frac{e^{2i\delta_0} - 1}{2ik}.
\]

Substituting $\delta_0 = 90^\circ$ (or $\pi/2$ radians), we compute $e^{2i\delta_0} = e^{i\pi} = -1$. Thus:

\[
f(0) = \frac{-1 - 1}{2ik} = \frac{-2}{2ik} = \frac{-1}{ik}.
\]

The imaginary part of $f(0)$ is:



---------------

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{k}.
\]

To calculate $k$, we use the relation $k = \sqrt{2mE}/\hbar$, where $m$ is the electron mass ($9.10938356 \times 10^{-31}$ kg), $E = 50$ MeV ($8.01 \times 10^{-12}$ J), and $\hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}$ J·s. Substituting these values:

\[
k = \frac{\sqrt{2mE}}{\hbar} = \frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot 9.10938356 \times 10^{-31} \cdot 8.01 \times 10^{-12}}}{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}.
\]

First, compute $\sqrt{2mE}$:

\[
\sqrt{2mE} = \sqrt{2 \cdot 9.10938356 \times 10^{-31} \cdot 8.01 \times 10^{-12}} = \sqrt{1.4596 \times 10^{-41}} \approx 3.82 \times 10^{-21} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

Then, divide by $\hbar$:

\[
k = \frac{3.82 \times 10^{-21}}{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}} \approx 3.62 \times 10^{13} \, \text{m}^{-1}.
\]

Convert $k$ to inverse femtometers ($1 \, \text{m}^{-1} = 10^{15} \, \text{fm}^{-1}$):

\[
k \approx 3.62 \times 10^{13} \, \text{m}^{-1} = 3.62 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{k} \approx \frac{1}{3.62 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{fm}^{-1}} \approx 27.6 \, \text{fm}.
\]

This result does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is **C) 177.675 fm**, which is approximately $6.44$ times larger than the calculated value. This discrepancy suggests a possible missing factor in the calculation or an error in the problem setup. Based on the options provided, the best choice is:
