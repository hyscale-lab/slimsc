Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it again.



---------------

The question says that there are five exoplanets with circular orbits, found using the TTV method. They're in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in the ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. All

---------------

 the planets have the same albedo. The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star. The formula I

---------------

 think is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ)) )^(1/4) *

---------------

 ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) * (1/a)^0.5 ), where a is the distance from the star. But wait, maybe

---------------

 I should think about it in terms of the inverse square law for radiation.

Oh right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T

---------------

 = T_eff * ( (1 - A) / (2) )^(1/4) * ( L / (16πσ a²) )^(1/4)

---------------

 ), but perhaps an easier way is to use the proportionality. Since all planets have the same albedo, A is the same for all. So

---------------

 the ratio of their temperatures will depend only on their distances from the star.

Wait, the key here is that the planets are in orbital resonance, and

---------------

 their periods are in a ratio. But how does that relate to their distances?

Oh, Kepler's third law comes into play here. The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance

---------------

 from the star). So, P² ∝ a³.

But wait, since the periods are given as a ratio, we

---------------

 can use that to find the a ratio. Let me think about that.

Given that the orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, I

---------------

'll assign variables. Let me say that the periods are P1, P2, P3, P4, P5.

---------------

 So P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.

Since

---------------

 P² ∝ a³, the ratio of a's would be (P1²) : (P2²) : (P3²) : (P4²) : (P5²) all

---------------

 raised to the 1/3 power. Or more accurately, a_i = k * P_i^(2/3), where k is a constant.

Wait, let

---------------

 me correct that. Because from Kepler's law, a³ ∝ P². So a = (P²)^(1/3) * some

---------------

 constant. So the ratio of a's for each planet is (P_i)^ (2/3) divided by the same constant.



---------------

So to find the ratio of a4 to a2, I can compute (P4/P2)^(2/3). Because a

---------------

 is proportional to P^(2/3).

Wait, no. Because for a2, the period is P2, and a4 is P

---------------

4. So the ratio a4/a2 would be (P4/P2)^(2/3).

Wait, no

---------------

, because a is proportional to P^(2/3). So a4 = k * P4^(2/3), a2 = k * P2^(2/3). So a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3).

Yes

---------------

, that makes sense.

So for Planet_4 and Planet_2, their periods are 3.5 and 2,

---------------

 respectively. So P4/P2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75.

So the ratio of their a's is (1.75)^(2/3). Let

---------------

 me calculate that.

Wait, 1.75 is equal to 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3). Let

---------------

 me compute that.

Alternatively, take the cube root of (7/4) squared. Let's compute (7/4) squared

---------------

: 49/16. Cube root of 49/16 is approximately (3.13)

---------------

^(1/3) because 49/16 is about 3.0625. Wait, 

---------------

3.0625 is 49/16. Hmm, the cube root of 3.0625 is about

---------------

 1.45, because 1.45^3 is approximately 3.05.

Wait, wait

---------------

, no. Wait, no, I think I messed up. Because (7/4)^(2/3) is the

---------------

 same as ( (7/4)^(1/3) )^2.

Alternatively, compute 1.75^(2/3).

Another

---------------

 approach: 1.75 is 7/4. Let's calculate ln(7/4) = ln(1.75) ≈ 0.5596. Multiply by 2/3: 0.5596 * 0.6667 ≈ 0.373. Then exponentiate: e^0.373 ≈ 1.453.

So a

---------------

4 is approximately 1.453 times a2.

Wait, wait, no. Because a4 is larger than a2 because

---------------

 P4 is larger than P2. So if a4 is 1.453 times a2, that means

---------------

 Planet 4 is farther away.

But wait, the equilibrium temperature depends on the inverse square root of the distance. Because the formula

---------------

 is T ∝ (1/a)^(1/2), since the flux is inversely proportional to a², and T

---------------

 is proportional to the fourth root of flux (from the Stefan-Boltzmann law).

Wait, the equilibrium temperature is given by T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)} )

---------------

 * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4) ). But since all planets have the same albedo and same

---------------

 star, the ratio of their temperatures will be inversely proportional to the square root of their distance from the star.

So, T �

---------------

� 1/√a.

So the ratio T4/T2 = (a2 / a4 )^(1/2).



---------------

Because T4 is proportional to 1/√a4, and T2 is proportional to 1/√a2. So T

---------------

4/T2 = (√a2 / √a4 ) = sqrt( a2 / a4 ).

So now

---------------

, from earlier, a4/a2 = (1.75)^(2/3) ≈ 1.453.

So a2/a4 = 1/(1.453) ≈ 0.688.

Wait

---------------

, wait, no. Wait, a4 is 1.453 * a2. So a2 = a4 / 1.453.

Wait

---------------

, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, the ratio a4/a2 is (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3) ≈ 1.453.

So a4 = a2 * 1.453.

So

---------------

 a2 = a4 / 1.453 ≈ a4 * 0.688.

Wait

---------------

, no. If a4 is 1.453 times a2, then a2 is a4 divided by 1.453, which is approximately

---------------

 0.688 times a4.

But when we take the ratio T4/T2, it's (1/√a4) / (1/√a2) ) = sqrt(a2/a4).

Which

---------------

 is sqrt(0.688) ≈ 0.829.

Wait, 0.829 is approximately 0.83. Looking

---------------

 at the options, option C is ~0.83. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me make

---------------

 sure I'm not making any mistakes here.

So the steps are:

1. The planets are in orbital resonance, so their periods are in the given ratio.

2. Using Kepler's law, P² ∝ a³,

---------------

 so a ∝ P^(2/3).

3. For Planet 2 and 4, their periods are P2 = 2 and P4 = 3.5.



---------------

4. So a4/a2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3) ≈ 1.453.

5. The

---------------

 equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of a, so T4/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 ) = sqrt(1/(1.453)) ≈ sqrt(0.688) ≈ 0.829.

Which

---------------

 is approximately 0.83, so option C.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation of (1.75)^(2/3). Let

---------------

 me compute it step by step.

First, 1.75 is 7/4. Let's compute ln(7/4):

ln(7) ≈ 1.9459



---------------

ln(4) ≈ 1.3863

So ln(7/4) ≈ 1.9459 - 1.3863 ≈ 0.5596.

Multiply by 2/3: 0.5596 * 2/3 ≈ 0.373.

Now

---------------

 e^0.373 ≈ e^0.37 is about 1.447, e

---------------

^0.373 is about 1.452. So yes, 1.453.



---------------

So a4 = a2 * 1.453.

So a2 is a4 / 1.453 ≈ 0.688 * a4.

So

---------------

 a2/a4 = 0.688.

So sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt(0.688) ≈ 0.829.



---------------

Which is approximately 0.83.

So the ratio T4/T2 is about 0.83, which is option C.

Wait

---------------

, but wait. Alternatively, the ratio is T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2) = (1

---------------

/1.453)^(1/2) ≈ (0.688)^(1/2) ≈ 0.829.

Yes

---------------

, that's correct.

So the answer should be option C, ~0.83.


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the fact that equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's distance from the star, \( T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \). The planets' orbital periods are in the ratio \( 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \), and from Kepler's third law (\( P^2 \propto a^3 \)), the semi-major axis \( a \) is proportional to \( P^{2/3} \).

### Step 1: Ratio of distances
For Planet_2 and Planet_4, their periods are \( P_2 = 2 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5 \). The ratio of their distances is:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left( \frac{P_4}{P_2} \right)^{2/3} = \left( \frac{3.5}{2} \right)^{2/3} = (1.75)^{2/3}.
\]

Calculating \( (1.75)^{2/3} \):
- \( 1.75 = \frac{7}{4} \),
- \( \ln(1.75) \approx 0.5596 \),
- \( \ln\left((1.75)^{2/3}\right) = \frac{2}{3} \cdot 0.5596 \approx 0.373 \),
- \( e^{0.373} \approx 1.453 \).

Thus, \( \frac{a_4}{a_2} \approx 1.453 \).

### Step 2: Ratio of equilibrium temperatures
The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance, so:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1.453}}.
\]

Calculating \( \sqrt{\frac{1}{1.453}} \):
- \( \frac{1}{1.453} \approx 0.688 \),
- \( \sqrt{0.688} \approx 0.829 \).

Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is approximately \( 0.83 \).

### Final Answer:
The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is closest to **0.83**, corresponding to option **C**.
