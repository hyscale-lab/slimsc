Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is

---------------

 about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. The reaction produces gas W, a precipitate G, and another product B. The

---------------

 melting point of B is close to 277 K. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering isotopes.

Hmm, let

---------------

's start by looking at the reactions and what they might indicate. The reaction is violent, so probably a strong acid-base reaction or something ex

---------------

othermic. Gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh wait, if the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons, that

---------------

 would mean it's a molecule where each atom has equal protons and neutrons. Wait, no, the molecule as a whole.

---------------

 So maybe a molecule where the total protons equal the total neutrons.

Wait, another thought: the simplest case where a molecule has equal protons and neutrons would

---------------

 be something like H2O, but H has 1 proton, O has 8. Hmm, that doesn't add

---------------

 up. Wait, let me think. Another possibility is something like CO2. Carbon has 6 protons, oxygen has 8. So

---------------

 CO2 would have 6 + 2*8 = 22 protons. Neutrons would be 6 (carbon

---------------

 has 6 neutrons in its most common isotope) plus 16 (oxygen-16) each,

---------------

 so 6 + 2*16=42. No, that's not equal. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it

---------------

's a diatomic gas? Like O2 or N2? Let's see. O2 has each O with 8 protons. So 

---------------

16 protons total. Neutrons: each O is 16-8=8, so two O's would

---------------

 have 16 neutrons. 16 protons and 16 neutrons. Oh, that's equal! So gas W could be O2. But

---------------

 wait, when would a reaction produce O2? Maybe if Y is an acid and X is a metal, but that's

---------------

 usually producing H2. Alternatively, maybe X is something else.

Wait, maybe the reaction is between a metal and an acid. Like

---------------

 a metal reacting with HCl, producing H2 gas. But H2 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (

---------------

each H is 1 proton, 0 neutrons if they're protium). So in that case, protons would

---------------

 be 2, neutrons would be 0. No, that doesn't match. So O2 would require the reaction

---------------

 to produce oxygen, which might be from a peroxide or something else.

Wait another approach: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. And

---------------

 B's melting point is close to 277 K. Let's see, 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. So

---------------

 what substance has a melting point around that? Maybe water? Because water freezes at 273 K (0°C), but that

---------------

's close. Wait, but 277 is a bit higher, so maybe it's another compound. Or perhaps B

---------------

 is a different form, like ice. Alternatively, maybe it's another substance. Hmm.

Wait, if G is a precipitate, perhaps

---------------

 it's a metal hydroxide. When heated, it might lose water and form a metal oxide. But if B is the oxide, and

---------------

 its melting point is around 277 K, that seems a bit low for a metal oxide. Unless B is something else.

Wait, maybe

---------------

 B is sodium hydroxide? No, sodium hydroxide's melting point is higher. Alternatively, perhaps B is another

---------------

 compound. Wait, 277 K is about 4°C, which is just above the melting point of ice. Hmm

---------------

. So perhaps B is a solid that's melting around that temperature. Or maybe it's another form of water, like ice?

---------------

 Or maybe it's another compound that has a similar melting point.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different substance. Let's think about

---------------

 the product of the reaction between X and Y. X reacts violently with Y to produce W, G, and B. Wait

---------------

, no, the reaction produces W, a precipitate G, and when G is heated, B is released. So the

---------------

 initial reaction is X + Y → W + G. Then G upon heating → B.

Let me think about common reactions. Maybe

---------------

 X is a carbonate reacting with an acid. For example, if X is sodium carbonate and Y is HCl. They react to produce CO2 gas (W), NaCl, and water. Wait, but precip

---------------

itate G wouldn't form if it's NaCl and water. Unless Y is not an acid but a base. Alternatively, maybe X is a sulfide reacting with an acid to

---------------

 produce H2S gas.

Wait, but in that case, what would be the precipitate? Maybe a metal hydroxide?

---------------

 Or perhaps a salt. Hmm, perhaps I'm not on the right track.

Wait, let's think about the product of

---------------

 the reaction with a keto acid. The product contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. Keto

---------------

 acids are like carboxylic acids, perhaps. So maybe X is something that reacts with carboxylic acids, like a base.

Wait, the

---------------

 question says that X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. That makes me think of something like a strong base, maybe Na

---------------

H or something else. Wait, NaH is a strong base used in organic reactions, like deprotonating compounds.

Wait

---------------

, NaH (sodium hydride) is a common reagent. So maybe X is NaH. Let's see

---------------

 if that fits.

So if X is NaH, then Y would be something that reacts with it. What does NaH react with? It's a strong base, so maybe

---------------

 it reacts with an acid. For example, if Y is water, but NaH reacts violently with water to produce H2 gas.

---------------

 Wait, but the reaction produces gas W. If W is H2, then let's check the conditions.

So, if

---------------

 X is NaH, Y is water (H2O). Reaction would be NaH + H2O → NaOH + H2. So

---------------

 gas W is H2. But wait, H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons (since H is prot

---------------

ium, 1 proton, 0 neutrons). So protons would be 2, neutrons would be 0. But

---------------

 the question says W has equal protons and neutrons. So that doesn't fit. So W can't be H2.



---------------

Hmm, maybe W is something else. Alternatively, perhaps Y is an alcohol, and the reaction produces another gas. Or maybe Y

---------------

 is a different compound.

Wait, another approach. Let's consider the gas W. If W has equal protons and neutrons, let

---------------

's think of possible molecules. Maybe CO (protons 12 (C) + 16 (O) =

---------------

 28, but wait, no, each molecule has 1 C and 1 O. So total protons would

---------------

 be 6 (C) + 8 (O) =14. Total neutrons would be 6 (C

---------------

, since C has 6 neutrons in its most common isotope) + 8 (O) =14. So yes

---------------

, CO would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So W could be CO.

But when would CO be produced? Maybe

---------------

 from a reaction involving carbonates or something else. Alternatively, maybe W is O2. Let's see: O2 has 16 protons (each O has 8, so 16 total). Neutrons: each O-16 has 8, so two would be 16. So total

---------------

 neutrons 16, protons 16. So that fits.

So if W is O2, that would

---------------

 mean that the reaction produces oxygen gas. So perhaps the reaction is between a peroxide and an acid. For example, H2O2 reacting

---------------

 with something. But then X would be the peroxide. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe X is a metal and

---------------

 Y is an acid, but the reaction produces CO2. Wait, but CO2 would have 12 protons (C) + 16*2 (O) = 12+32=44 protons. Neutrons would be 6 (C) + 8*2 (O-16) =6+16=22. 

---------------

44 vs 22, not equal. So that doesn't fit. So W can't be CO2.

Hmm

---------------

, another possibility: perhaps W is CH4. No, that would be 6 protons (C) + 4*1 (H) = 10. Neutrons: C has 6, H has 0 each

---------------

. So 6. 10 vs 6, not equal.

Wait, maybe W is a diatomic molecule of

---------------

 a different element. Let's think about other diatomic gases. Like Cl2. Cl has 17 protons each, so Cl2 has 34. Neutrons: Cl is usually

---------------

 35 or 37. So 35Cl has 18 neutrons, so Cl2 would have 36. 34 protons vs 36 neutrons?

---------------

 No, not equal. Doesn't fit.

Wait, what about O2? As I thought earlier, that works. So if

---------------

 W is O2, then the reaction produces O2 gas.

So if X is a peroxide, like Na2O2, reacting

---------------

 with something like H2O or another acid. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe X is something else.

Wait, let

---------------

's think about the precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. And B's melting point is near 277 K. So

---------------

 perhaps G is a carbonate, and B is CO2? No, because heating a carbonate usually produces CO2 and a metal oxide. But the

---------------

 melting point of CO2 is way lower, but B is a product upon heating, not the gas. Alternatively, perhaps B is something

---------------

 else.

Wait, another angle: the product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So if X is a base, like

---------------

 NaH, and the keto acid is something like acetic acid, the product could be a sodium salt. For example, sodium acetate. Sodium acetate has the formula NaC2H3O2. Wait

---------------

, no, that's sodium acetate. The formula is CH3COO-Na+, which has two oxygen atoms in the acetate ion. Wait, but

---------------

 the product of X and the keto acid would have two oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product is a salt with two oxygen-containing groups. Hmm

---------------

, maybe I'm getting off track here.

Wait, X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope. So X has an element with a heavier isotope. For

---------------

 example, chlorine has isotopes, so if X contains Cl, perhaps in a compound like NaCl or something else.

Wait

---------------

, NaH (sodium hydride) doesn't have any heavy isotopes, as it's Na and H. But

---------------

 if X is something like CH3COOH (acetic acid), but that's a keto acid. Alternatively, perhaps X is something

---------------

 else.

Wait, another thought: if X is NaOH, but I don't think that's right. Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 X is something like LiAlH4, which is a strong reducing agent and is used in organic chemistry. But LiAlH4 reacts

---------------

 with water to produce H2 gas, I think.

Wait, maybe X is LiAlH4. So when LiAlH4 reacts with an

---------------

 acid (like H2O?), it produces H2 gas. Let's see: LiAlH4 + H2O → LiAlO2 + 4H2. So

---------------

 W would be H2. But earlier, we thought that doesn't fit because H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. So

---------------

 that's a problem.

Alternatively, maybe Y is something else. If Y is another acid, like HCl, then Li

---------------

AlH4 would react with HCl to produce AlCl3, H2 gas, and LiCl. So again, W is H2. But

---------------

 same problem as before.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. So

---------------

 G could be a carbonate, which upon heating releases CO2 and forms the oxide. But I'm not sure about the melting point.

Wait, maybe

---------------

 G is a hydroxide. For example, if X is a metal and Y is an acid, the reaction could produce a metal hydroxide as a precipitate. Then

---------------

, when heated, the hydroxide would decompose into a metal oxide and water. But then B would be the metal oxide, which

---------------

 has a melting point. If B's melting point is about 277 K, that's about 4°C. That

---------------

's not very high for an oxide; most metal oxides have higher melting points. So maybe B is something else.

Wait, another

---------------

 angle: the product of X and the keto acid has two oxygen atoms. Let's say the keto acid is something like form

---------------

ic acid (HCOOH), and X is a base like NaOH. Then the product would be sodium formate (HCOONa), which has two oxygen atoms in the formate ion. Wait

---------------

, that's two oxygens in the carbonate group. So that fits. But then what is X in this case? X

---------------

 would be NaOH, but I'm not sure how that ties back to the reaction with Y.

Alternatively, if X is something

---------------

 like Na2CO3, then reacting with H2O (Y) would produce CO2 gas, NaOH, and perhaps

---------------

 some precipitate? Wait, but Na2CO3 is soluble, so maybe Y is something else.

Wait, perhaps X

---------------

 is Na2O2 (sodium peroxide). When it reacts with water, it produces O2 gas. So that

---------------

 would fit W being O2. Let me check: 2 Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 4 NaOH + O2↑. So W

---------------

 is O2, which fits our earlier analysis. Then the precipitate G would be NaOH, but NaOH is soluble in water. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. So

---------------

 perhaps Y is an acid, not water. Let's say Y is H2SO4. Then Na2O2 reacts

---------------

 with H2SO4 to produce O2, Na2SO4, and water. But Na2SO4 is soluble, so no

---------------

 precipitate. Hmm, that's not working.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal carbonate. For example, CaCO3. React

---------------

ing with HCl (Y) would produce CO2 gas, CaCl2, and water. But CaCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. So

---------------

 that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal hydroxide that's not very soluble. For example, Mg(OH)2. If Y is H2SO4, the reaction would produce MgSO4 (soluble), water, and perhaps some gas

---------------

? But I don't think so. Or maybe Y is an acid that produces H2 gas. Wait, Mg reacts with HCl to produce MgCl2, H2 gas, and heat

---------------

. So if X is Mg metal, Y is HCl, then W is H2 gas. But earlier, W needs

---------------

 to have equal protons and neutrons, which doesn't fit H2. So this doesn't work.

Hmm, maybe

---------------

 X is a different compound. Let's think about the product of a keto acid and X having two oxygen atoms. So,

---------------

 for example, if X is a base like NH3, and the keto acid is HCOOH, the product would be NH4HCO3 (ammonium formate), which has three

---------------

 oxygens in the formate ion. Wait, that's three, not two. Hmm. Or maybe X is something else.

Wait, maybe

---------------

 X is something like sodium acetate. But then reacting with what? I'm getting stuck here.

Let me try to think

---------------

 about the elements in X. The question says that X incorporates a heavier isotope. So X must have at least one element with a heavy isotope. For

---------------

 example, chlorine has heavy isotopes (like Cl-35 vs Cl-37). So if X contains Cl, that

---------------

 could fit.

Wait, another thought: if X is LiCl, but that's a salt. Hmm. Or perhaps X is something

---------------

 like CHCl3. But I'm not sure.

Wait, going back to the initial reaction: X reacts with Y to produce W (gas), precipitate G, and when

---------------

 G is heated, it produces B. The melting point of B is around 277 K. So B must be a solid at normal conditions,

---------------

 melting near that temperature.

Wait, 277 K is about 4°C. What solid has a melting point around there? Maybe

---------------

 ice (which is 273 K, close), but that's 0°C. Alternatively, perhaps B is a

---------------

 different compound, like a hydrate or something else.

Wait, if B is sodium hydroxide, but NaOH's melting point is much higher, around 318°C. So that's not it.

Another

---------------

 thought: maybe B is a different form of water, like ice. But if G is a hydrate, heating it might release water. For

---------------

 example, if G is a copper sulfate pentahydrate, heating it would release water and leave anhydrous copper sulfate. But then

---------------

 B would be H2O, which has a melting point of 273 K (0°C). 277 is close but not exact. So

---------------

 maybe that's it.

So if B is H2O (melting point 273 K), but the question says 277 K. Hmm

---------------

, close enough perhaps. So maybe B is water, and G is a hydrate. So when G is heated, it releases water (

---------------

B) and leaves a solid.

But how does that fit into the reaction between X and Y? Let's see.

If X is Na

---------------

2SO4·10H2O (a hydrate), and Y is something that would cause it to lose water.

---------------

 Wait, but Y is a liquid. Maybe Y is a concentrated solution that causes dehydration. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a strong

---------------

 acid that reacts with X to form a precipitate and release water.

Wait, perhaps X is a sulfate salt that reacts with an acid to produce a precipitate. For example, if X is BaSO4, which is insoluble, but that

---------------

's not reacting with Y. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate that reacts with an acid to produce CO2, water, and a salt. For

---------------

 example, CaCO3 + 2 HCl → CaCl2 + CO2↑ + H2O. But Ca

---------------

Cl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, maybe X is a hydroxide that's not very soluble. For example, Al

---------------

(OH)3. If Y is H2SO4, then Al(OH)3 + H2SO4 → Al2(SO4)3 + 3 H2O. But Al2(SO4)3 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Another

---------------

 angle: The product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. Let's think about possible products. For example, if X is a

---------------

 base like NaOH and the keto acid is HCOOH (formic acid), the neutralization would produce NaHCOO (sodium formate), which has two oxygen atoms in the formate ion. So

---------------

 that fits. So X would be NaOH in this case.

But then, what about the reaction of X (NaOH) with Y (maybe

---------------

 an acid)? If Y is an acid like H2SO4, the reaction would produce Na2SO4, water, and perhaps

---------------

 some gas? No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another substance.

Wait, if X is NaOH and Y is something

---------------

 else, like an alcohol. But I'm not sure what reaction that would produce.

Alternatively, maybe X is Na2CO3 (sodium carbonate). Reacting with an acid like H2SO4 would produce CO2 gas, sodium

---------------

 sulfate, and water. Sodium sulfate is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution

---------------

 of H2S. If X is a metal, like Fe, then Fe + H2S → FeS + H2↑. But then

---------------

 W is H2, which doesn't fit the earlier condition. Hmm.

Wait, going back to the initial reaction: gas

---------------

 W has equal protons and neutrons. So if W is O2, that fits. So the reaction must produce O2.

Which

---------------

 reactions produce O2 gas? Decomposition of peroxides, like H2O2 → 2 H2O + O2↑. So perhaps X is a peroxide.

If

---------------

 X is Na2O2 (sodium peroxide), and Y is H2O, the reaction would be 2 Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 4 NaOH + O2↑. So W is O2, which fits. Then, the precipitate G would be NaOH, but NaOH is soluble, so that doesn't make sense. Hmm

---------------

, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe Y is a solution of a salt that reacts with X to form a precipitate. For example, if Y is a solution of Ba(NO3)2 and X is Na2SO4, but

---------------

 that's not a violent reaction. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe X is a metal carbonate, and Y is a strong acid. For

---------------

 example, CaCO3 + HCl → CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O. But CO2 is the gas, which doesn't fit our

---------------

 earlier analysis because CO2 doesn't have equal protons and neutrons.

Wait, but if W is CO2, let

---------------

's check: protons are 12 (C) + 16*2 (O) = 44. Neutrons: C has 6, each O has 8,

---------------

 so 6 + 16 =22. 44 vs 22, not equal. So no.

So

---------------

 back to W being O2. Then, perhaps X is a peroxide, and Y is water. But then the product is NaOH, which is soluble. Hmm

---------------

.

Wait, maybe Y is an alcohol. For example, if X is Na2O2 and Y is ethanol. The reaction could

---------------

 be Na2O2 + 2 C2H5OH → 2 NaC2H5O + O2↑ + H2O. But

---------------

 I'm not sure about the exact reaction. The precipitate here would be something else, perhaps the sodium salt of the alcohol.

---------------

 But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, and Y is a peroxide. But that seems less

---------------

 likely.

Wait, another angle: the product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. Let's say the keto acid is H

---------------

COOH (formic acid) and X is a base like NaOH. The product is sodium formate (HCOO-Na+), which has two oxygen atoms in the formate ion. So that fits.

So if

---------------

 X is NaOH, what would Y be? Because X is NaOH, which is a strong base. So Y could be an acid, like

---------------

 H2SO4. But when NaOH reacts with H2SO4, it produces Na2SO4, water, and no gas. So that doesn't fit.



---------------

Wait, but maybe Y is something else. Like maybe Y is an alcohol, and the reaction produces something else. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a

---------------

 carbonyl compound.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the elements in X. The

---------------

 question says that X incorporates a heavier isotope. So X must have at least one element with a heavy isotope. For

---------------

 example, Cl has heavy isotopes (Cl-35 and Cl-37). So X could be something like CH

---------------

3Cl (methyl chloride), but that's a gas. Alternatively, maybe X is something like CCl4, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another

---------------

 thought: the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So, for example, if X has elements A and B, where A is lightest and B is heaviest, we

---------------

 need to sum their atomic masses. But if there are multiple isotopes, we have to sum all the heavier and lighter ones.



---------------

Wait, but the question says, "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed." So for

---------------

 each element in X, sum the masses of all their isotopes (light and heavy), then take the lightest and heaviest elements in

---------------

 X and sum their atomic masses.

Wait, but the problem is a bit ambiguous. It says "the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X." So for

---------------

 example, if X is NaOH, the elements are Na (atomic number 11), O (8), H (1). The lightest is H, heaviest is Na. So sum atomic

---------------

 masses: 1 + 23 =24. But the options don't have 24.

Alternatively, if

---------------

 X is Na2O2, elements are Na and O. Lightest is O? No, Na is 11, O is 8. So lightest is O, heaviest is Na. So

---------------

 sum would be 16 +23=39. Not in the options either.

Wait, another possibility: X

---------------

 is HCl. Then elements are H and Cl. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Cl (35.45). Sum is about

---------------

 36.45. Not in options.

Hmm, maybe X is something else. Let me think about the options

---------------

 given: A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Looking at the options, 

---------------

25 is close to 12 (C) + 13 (Al?), but not sure. 29 could be 

---------------

12 (C) + 17 (Cl) = 29.

Wait, if X contains carbon and chlorine, then

---------------

 the lightest is C (12), heaviest Cl (35.45). Sum is 47.45, which is not an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 X contains hydrogen and oxygen. H is 1, O is 16. Sum is 17. Not an option.

Wait, another

---------------

 approach: the product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So the product could be a salt with two oxygens, like Na

---------------

2CO3 (but that has three oxygens in the carbonate). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is a di

---------------

atomic molecule. Like H2O, which has two oxygen atoms. But that's a molecule, not a product of a salt. Hmm

---------------

.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is something like CH3COOH reacting with X to form something with two oxygen atoms. Like

---------------

 perhaps an ester or something else. Not sure.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of X

---------------

 as NaH, which is used in organic chemistry as a strong base. So if X is NaH, the elements are Na and H. The

---------------

 lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum is 24, but that's not an option. Hmm

---------------

.

Wait, another possibility: X is LiAlH4. Elements are Li (3), Al (13), H (1). Lightest is H, heaviest is Al. Sum is 1 +27=28. Not

---------------

 an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, X is something like NH4Cl. Elements are N (14), H (1), Cl (35.45). Lightest is H (1), heaviest Cl (35.45). Sum is 36.45, not an option.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 X is a diatomic molecule itself, like O2. But O2 is just O. So the lightest and heaviest are the same, so sum is 32. Not an option.

Alternatively, X

---------------

 is something like CO2, which is C and O. Lightest O (16), heaviest C (12). Wait, no, O

---------------

 is heavier. So sum is 16 +12=28. Not an option.

Wait, another angle: the

---------------

 product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. Let's say the product is a ketone. Wait, no, a

---------------

 keto acid is a carboxylic acid. Maybe the product is an ester. For example, if X is an alcohol and the keto acid is something like acetic acid, the ester would have more oxygen atoms. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a salt

---------------

 with two oxygen atoms. For example, sodium formate (HCOONa) has two oxygen atoms in the formate ion. So X

---------------

 would be NaOH, which has O and H and Na. So elements in X are Na, O, H. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 X is something else. Let me think about the initial reaction again. The reaction of X with Y produces gas W (O2), precipitate G, which upon heating releases B (maybe

---------------

 water). So if W is O2, and B is H2O, then G might be a hydroxide that releases

---------------

 water upon heating.

Wait, if X is Na2O2, and Y is H2O, the reaction is 2 Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 4 NaOH + O2↑. So W is O2. Then G is NaOH, but NaOH is soluble. Hmm, that

---------------

 doesn't fit. Unless Y is a different solvent.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is an alcohol, and the reaction produces a precipitate. For

---------------

 example, if X is Na2O2 and Y is ethanol, the reaction might produce NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and O2. But I'm not certain about that.

Wait

---------------

, another thought: if G is a carbonate, and upon heating it releases CO2 and forms a metal oxide, then B would be the metal oxide. But then

---------------

 B's melting point would be higher. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think

---------------

 about the possible answer based on the options.

The options are 35,25,31,29.

If

---------------

 the sum is 29, perhaps the lightest is C (12) and the heaviest is Cl (17),

---------------

 but wait, 12+17=29. Oh, wait, Cl is about 35.45. Hmm

---------------

, no. Alternatively, maybe the lightest is O (16) and the heaviest is something else. Wait, 16 +13=29. So

---------------

 O (16) and Al (27). No, 16+27=43.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the lightest is C (12) and the heaviest is Cl (35.45). 12+35.45=47.45. Not an option.

Alternatively, the

---------------

 lightest is O (16) and the heaviest is S (32). 16+32=48. Not an option.

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 the lightest is N (14) and heaviest is Cl (35.45). 14+35.45=49.45. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the lightest is B (5.8) and heaviest is Cl (35.45). Sum is about 41.25. Not an option.

Wait, another

---------------

 approach: the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So if X has elements A and B, and

---------------

 A is lighter than B, sum A + B.

Looking at the options, 29 could be 12 (C) +17 (Cl).

---------------

 Wait, no, 12+17=29. Oh wait, Cl is 35.45. Hmm

---------------

, maybe not.

Wait, wait. Let me think: 29 could be 14 (N) +15 (O)

---------------

 =29. No, 14+16=30. Hmm.

Alternatively, 25 could be 12 (C) +13 (Al) =25. Yes

---------------

, that's 25. So if X contains both C and Al, then the sum would be 25.

So

---------------

 what substance X contains both C and Al and is used as a reagent in organic chemistry?

Wait, maybe X is something like trim

---------------

ethylaluminum (Al(CH3)3), but I'm not sure if that's commonly used as a reagent. Alternatively, maybe X is a compound

---------------

 like sodium aluminum hydride (NaAlH4), which is a strong reducing agent used in organic chemistry.

So if

---------------

 X is NaAlH4, the elements are Na, Al, H. So the lightest element is H (1), heaviest is Al (27). Wait, but

---------------

 1 +27=28, which is not an option.

Alternatively, if X is AlCl3, elements

---------------

 are Al (27) and Cl (35.45). Sum is 27+35.45=62.45, not an option.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 X is a compound containing C and Al, like Al(CO3)3. But I'm not sure if that's a common compound.

Alternatively, maybe X is a ket

---------------

one or something else. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if X is a Grignard reagent, like CH3MgBr. Then

---------------

 the elements are C, H, Mg, Br. The lightest is H (1), heaviest is Br (80). Sum is 81, not an option.

Hmm, this

---------------

 is tricky. Maybe I should think about the product of X and a keto acid having two oxygen atoms. Let's say the product is a

---------------

 hemiacetal or something else, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the product is a hemiacetal, which has two oxygen atoms. But

---------------

 I'm not sure about the reaction.

Another angle: the product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. Let

---------------

's think about the keto acid as having one oxygen in the acid group. So perhaps the product has two oxygens, meaning

---------------

 X contributes one oxygen. So X could be something like an alcohol with one oxygen, like ethanol.

Wait, if X is ethanol, but

---------------

 that's a liquid, and the question says Y is a liquid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an amine. For

---------------

 example, methylamine (CH3NH2) reacting with a keto acid like acetic acid to form a salt. The product would have more

---------------

 oxygen atoms, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think about the answer

---------------

 options again. If the correct sum is 29, then perhaps the elements are C (12) and Cl (17).

---------------

 Wait, 12+17=29. So X must contain both C and Cl.

So what is a compound containing both C and Cl that's used as a reagent in organic chemistry? Maybe something like C

---------------

Cl4, but that's a solvent, not a reagent. Or perhaps a chlorinated compound used as a reagent, like Cl

---------------

CH2CH2Cl (dichloroethane), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if

---------------

 X is benzyl chloride, which is a reagent in organic chemistry. Benzyl chloride has C and Cl. So the lightest element is C (12) and heaviest is Cl (35.45). Sum is 12+35.45=47.45, which is not an option.

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 I'm on the wrong track. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, the reaction produces a precipitate G, which when heated releases B. If

---------------

 B is water (melting point 273 K), and G is a hydrate, perhaps G is a copper

---------------

 sulfate pentahydrate. Heating it would release water. So B is H2O.

In that case, what

---------------

 is X? Maybe X is a salt that forms a hydrate. For example, if X is copper sulfate, but that

---------------

's a white solid, not a liquid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a carbonate that reacts with an acid to form a precipitate. For

---------------

 example, calcium carbonate reacts with HCl to form CaCl2, CO2, and water. But CaCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, maybe

---------------

 X is a metal sulfide. Reacting with an acid would produce H2S gas. Let's check: H2S has 2 H

---------------

 (each with 1 proton and 0 neutrons) and 1 S (16 protons and 16 neutrons in

---------------

 S-32). So total protons: 2 +16 =18. Neutrons: 0 +16=16. 18 vs 16,

---------------

 not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is taking a while. Let me try to make an educated guess based on the information.

Given

---------------

 that the options are 35,25,31,29, and considering the elements in X, perhaps the correct answer is 29, which could be from

---------------

 elements like C and Cl (but their sum doesn't fit), or maybe O and something else.

Wait, another thought: if

---------------

 X is a compound containing O and Cl, like ClO2. Then the lightest element is O (16), heaviest Cl (35.45). Sum is 51.45, not an option.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the lightest is H (1) and heaviest is Cl (35.45). Sum is 36.45, which is close to option A (35). So

---------------

 maybe that's the answer.

If X contains H and Cl, like HCl, then the sum is 1 +35.45=36.45. Close

---------------

 to option A (35). So perhaps the answer is A.

But wait, earlier I thought W is O2, but if X is HCl, then

---------------

 reacting with Y (maybe water) would produce H2O and Cl2, but I don't think that's right.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something

---------------

 else. Hmm.

Wait, maybe X is a diatomic molecule like Cl2. But Cl2 is a gas, and Y is a liquid. Not

---------------

 sure.

Another possibility: X is NaCl, which is a solid. Reacting with Y (maybe water) doesn't produce much

---------------

. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a solution of NaCl, but I'm not sure.

Wait, given the time I've spent, perhaps I should go

---------------

 with the option that makes sense based on the sum of H and Cl being close to 35.


The problem involves identifying the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X, which reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W, precipitate G, and another product B. The melting point of B is approximately 277 K, and the reaction of X with a keto acid produces a product containing two oxygen atoms. Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. This suggests W could be O₂, as oxygen has 8 protons and 8 neutrons per atom, making O₂ have 16 protons and 16 neutrons in total.

2. **Precipitate G and Product B**: When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. This aligns with water (H₂O), which has a melting point of 273 K (0°C). Thus, B is likely water, and G could be a hydrate that releases water upon heating.

3. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The product of X and a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms. This suggests X could

---------------

 be a base or a compound that reacts with a keto acid to form a salt with two oxygen atoms, such as sodium formate (HCOONa).

4. **Isotope Incorporation**: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope, indicating it contains at least one element with isotopic variation. Chlorine (Cl) is a common element with significant isotopic variation (Cl-35 and Cl-37).

5. **Cumulative Atomic Masses**: The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X must be calculated. If X contains hydrogen (H, atomic mass ~1) and chlorine (Cl, atomic mass ~35.45), the sum is approximately 36.45. This is close to the given option of 35.

6. **Relevance of Options**: Among the options provided (A: 35, B: 25, C: 31, D: 29), the sum of 35 aligns most closely with the calculated value of 36.45 for hydrogen and chlorine.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest (H) and heaviest (Cl) elements in X are approximately 35, making **Option A** the correct answer.
