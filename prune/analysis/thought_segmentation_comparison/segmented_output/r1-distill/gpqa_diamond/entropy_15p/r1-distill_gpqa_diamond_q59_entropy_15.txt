Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

So

---------------

, there's this civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and they've built a super fast spacecraft. It's going at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's really, really fast. The average

---------------

 lifetime of these aliens is about 150 solar years. Now, they're sending an astronaut who's 22 years old, and we need to find out how long it takes for him to reach Earth from his own perspective. The options are A

---------------

 to D, with A being that he dies before getting there.

Hmm. So, the question is about time dilation in special relativity. I

---------------

 remember that when you're moving at speeds close to the speed of light, time slows down from the perspective of someone not moving relative to you. But

---------------

 wait, from whose perspective? The astronaut's or the Earth's?

Wait, the question says, "how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth." Oh, right, so we're considering the proper time experienced by the astronaut.

So

---------------

, the proper time τ is what the astronaut experiences. The Earth observer would see a longer time, but we don't need that here. We

---------------

 need the astronaut's time.

But wait, another thing. The distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. How

---------------

 far is that? I think the LMC is about 160,000 light-years away from the Milky Way, but I

---------------

'm not exactly sure. Wait, but the problem doesn't give any distance. Oh, that's a problem. Or does

---------------

 it? Because if we're given the speed, perhaps we can compute the time in Earth's frame and then apply the time dilation formula

---------------

.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplified. Let me think. Suppose the distance is D in Earth's frame. The time

---------------

 from Earth's perspective would be t = D / v, where v is 0.99999987c.

But from

---------------

 the astronaut's perspective, due to time dilation, the time experienced would be less. The formula for time dilation is τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Because

---------------

 the astronaut's clock runs slower in Earth's frame, but the astronaut's own time is shorter.

Wait, no, actually

---------------

, the proper time τ is the shortest time, so for the astronaut, the time experienced is τ. The Earth time is longer.

So

---------------

, first, compute t (Earth time), then multiply by sqrt(1 - v²/c²) to get τ.

But wait

---------------

, I don't know D. Oh wait, maybe the problem expects us to use the speed and ignore the distance, but that doesn't make sense. Hmm

---------------

.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the distance to Earth as approximately the same as the distance to the LMC, but maybe

---------------

 it's given in the problem? Let me check. Oh, the problem doesn't give the distance. That's confusing. Without

---------------

 knowing D, how can I compute t?

Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me read the problem again. The question

---------------

 is about the astronaut's lifetime. The average lifetime is 150 years. Oh, but the astronaut is 22 years

---------------

 old. So, from his perspective, how much time passes during the trip.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the distance

---------------

 is such that at 0.99999987c, the time is about 150 years or

---------------

 something. But that seems unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the time taken as per Earth is, say, T

---------------

 years, and then the astronaut's experienced time is T multiplied by the Lorentz factor.

Wait, let me think again

---------------

. The astronaut is 22, and their average lifetime is 150. So, in their frame, the

---------------

 trip time must be such that 22 + τ < 150, otherwise they wouldn't survive. If τ is the

---------------

 time experienced during the trip, then if τ is, say, 77 years, 22 + 77 = 99, which is less than 150, so they live

---------------

. But if the trip takes longer than 128 years (150-22), then they would die.

But

---------------

 without knowing τ, how can we calculate? So I must have missed something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the distance

---------------

 is negligible compared to the speed, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the speed to compute

---------------

 the time in the astronaut's frame without considering the distance. That can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using

---------------

 the concept of length contraction. From the astronaut's perspective, the distance to Earth is contracted, so the time experienced is (

---------------

contracted distance) / speed.

Ah, that makes sense. Because in the astronaut's frame, the distance is contracted. So,

---------------

 the proper length is D (Earth's frame), and the contracted length is D' = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Then, the time τ is

---------------

 D' / v.

So, putting it together: τ = (D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) ) / v.

But I

---------------

 still don't know D. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the distance is such that the Earth is a

---------------

 certain number of light-years away, but the problem doesn't state it. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe

---------------

 the problem is expecting me to compute the time it takes for the trip from the Earth's frame, then apply the time dilation formula

---------------

. But without knowing the distance, I can't compute t.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the speed and the fact

---------------

 that the speed is 0.99999987c, which is very close to c. So

---------------

, the time experienced would be approximately the Earth time multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but without

---------------

 knowing the distance, I can't find the Earth time. So maybe the problem is assuming that the time from Earth's frame is the

---------------

 same as the distance in light-years divided by the speed in terms of c. But without knowing the distance, this approach is

---------------

 impossible.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the problem is referring to the distance between the LMC and Earth, which is about

---------------

 163,000 light-years. Let me confirm that. Yes, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 to 170,000 light-years away. Let's take

---------------

 D = 160,000 light-years.

So, the time from Earth's frame would be t = D / v.

v is 0.99999987 c, so v

---------------

 ≈ c. So, t ≈ D / c = 160,000 / 1 =

---------------

 160,000 years. Wait, that can't be right. Because 0.99999987 is very

---------------

 close to c, so t is approximately D / v ≈ 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ roughly

---------------

 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 160,000.002 years

---------------

. Wait, that's still about 160,000 years.

But the astronaut's experienced time τ is t multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Compute

---------------

 sqrt(1 - v²/c²): v = 0.99999987c, so v² = (0.99999987)^2 c².



---------------

(0.99999987)^2 ≈ (1 - 1.3e-6)²

---------------

 ≈ 1 - 2.6e-6. So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 2.6e-6. So

---------------

 sqrt(2.6e-6) ≈ sqrt(2.6)*1e-3 ≈ 1.612e-3.



---------------

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 0.001612.

So τ = t * 0.001612.

t is 

---------------

160,000 years, so τ ≈ 160,000 * 0.001612 ≈ 258 years.

Wait, but

---------------

 the astronaut is 22 years old. 22 + 258 = 280, which is way beyond

---------------

 their 150-year lifespan. So the astronaut would die before reaching Earth. So option A is correct.

Wait, but the

---------------

 options don't have 258. The options are 72, 81, 77, or the

---------------

 astronaut dies. So if the calculation says 258 years, then the astronaut dies before reaching Earth.

So the answer would be A.

Wait, but perhaps

---------------

 I made a mistake in calculating the distance. Because the distance between the LMC and Earth is about 160,000 light-years. So

---------------

 if the spaceship is going at 0.99999987c, the Earth time is 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 

---------------

160,000 years, as I said. The astronaut's time is about 258 years. But

---------------

 the astronaut's average lifetime is 150, so 258 is more than that. So they would not survive.

But

---------------

 wait, the calculation gives 258 years, which is way beyond 150. So the astronaut would die before

---------------

 reaching Earth. So option A is correct.

But wait, let me double-check the math. Let me compute v²/c

---------------

² again. v = 0.99999987c. So v² = (0.99999987)^2 c². Let me compute 

---------------

0.99999987 squared.

0.99999987 * 0.99999987.

---------------

 Let's compute this.

(1 - 1.23e-6)² = 1 - 2*1.23e-6 + (1.23e-6)^2 ≈ 1 - 2.46e-6 +

---------------

 negligible. So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 2.46e-6.

Then, sqrt(2.46e-6) is sqrt(2.46)*1e-3. sqrt(2.46) is approximately 1.568. So 1.568e-3 �

---------------

� 0.001568.

So τ = t * 0.001568.

t is 160,000 years.

---------------

 So τ = 160,000 * 0.001568 ≈ 250.88 years.

So

---------------

 around 251 years. The astronaut is 22, so 22 + 251 = 273,

---------------

 which is way over 150. So he wouldn't survive.

So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait

---------------

 a second. The problem says the average lifetime is about 150 years. So if the astronaut is 22, he

---------------

 has about 150 - 22 = 128 years left. So if the trip takes 251 years, he would

---------------

 have died before reaching Earth.

But wait, another thought. Maybe I got the distance wrong. Because the problem doesn't specify

---------------

 the distance, perhaps it's considering that the time from Earth's frame is much less. Or perhaps I should think in terms of velocity

---------------

 being so high that the time is small.

Wait, maybe I should think about the time in Earth's frame. Let's see

---------------

, if the distance is D, then t = D/(0.99999987c). So

---------------

, D is 160,000 light-years. So t = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 *

---------------

 (1 + 1.3e-6) ≈ 160,000 + 208 ≈ 160,208 years.

So

---------------

, the time from Earth's perspective is about 160,208 years. The astronaut's time is 

---------------

160,208 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 160,208 * 0.001568 ≈ 251 years.



---------------

So, same as before. The astronaut would die before reaching Earth.

But wait, looking at the options, the only option that makes

---------------

 sense is A. So the answer is A.


To determine whether the astronaut survives the journey to Earth, we analyze the situation using special

---------------

 relativity. The spacecraft travels at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), and the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Earth is approximately \( D = 160,000 \) light-years. The astronaut is 22 years old, and the average lifetime of these aliens is 150 years. We calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (\( \tau \)) using the time dilation formula:

\[
\tau = t \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]

where \( t \) is the time measured in Earth's frame. First, we compute \( t \) as the time it takes to travel the distance \( D \) at speed \( v \):

\[
t = \frac{D}{v} = \frac{160,000}{0.99999987} \approx 160,208 \, \text{years}.
\]

Next, we calculate \( \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \). Squaring \( v \):

\[
v^2 = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974.
\]

Thus:

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \approx 1 - 0.99999974 = 2.6 \times 10^{-6}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \approx \sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 0.001612.
\]

Now, substit

---------------

uting into the time dilation formula:

\[
\tau = t \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \approx 160,208 \cdot 0.001612 \approx 258 \, \text{years}.
\]

The astronaut is 22 years old, so the total age upon reaching Earth would be:

\[
22 + 258 = 280 \, \text{years}.
\]

Since the average lifetime of these aliens is 150 years, the astronaut would die before reaching Earth. Therefore, the correct answer is:
