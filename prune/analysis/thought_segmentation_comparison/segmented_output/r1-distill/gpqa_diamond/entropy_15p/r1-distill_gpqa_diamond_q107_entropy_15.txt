Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with

---------------

 the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. The setup is a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, and they mention that m (the orbital magnetic quantum number) has small values. The magnetic field strength is 1 Tesla, and the transition energy corresponds

---------------

 to a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers.

Hmm, I remember that the paramagnetic coupling term is

---------------

 related to the Zeeman effect. The Zeeman effect involves the splitting of atomic energy levels in a magnetic field. The param

---------------

agnetic term would be the contribution from the electron's orbital motion, while diamagnetic is from its spin. But wait, the

---------------

 problem specifies paramagnetic coupling, so that's the orbital part.

The transition energy ΔE is given by the wavelength λ. I

---------------

 can calculate ΔE using the energy of a photon formula: E = hc/λ. Since λ is 0.4861 micrometers, that's 486.1 nanometers, which I think is in the visible range,

---------------

 maybe the Balmer series of hydrogen. So ΔE would be the energy difference between two energy levels in the hydrogen atom.



---------------

Wait, but the paramagnetic term is the Zeeman splitting. So the Zeeman energy shift is given by ΔE_zeeman = μ_B * B * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m is the magnetic quantum number. Oh

---------------

 wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The Zeeman effect for orbital motion is given

---------------

 by ΔE = (e^2 * B * m) / (8π m_e c), which is the same as μ_B * m * B. Alternatively

---------------

, I've seen it expressed as (μ_B * m) * B.

Wait, the Bohr magneton μ_B is (

---------------

eħ)/(2 m_e), and the orbital contribution is given by that. So the paramagnetic term is proportional to B and m.

The

---------------

 problem states that m is small, which probably means m is near zero or a small integer. But wait, in hydrogen, the possible

---------------

 m values are from -l to +l. For example, in the p orbital (l=1), m can be -1, 0, +1. So if

---------------

 m is small, maybe m is zero, but that would make the term zero. Alternatively, maybe m is ±1,

---------------

 but small in magnitude.

But in any case, the question is comparing the paramagnetic coupling term (which I'll call H_p

---------------

) with the transition energy ΔE.

So first, I need to compute both values.

Let me compute ΔE first. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 μm, which is 486.1e-9 meters. So

---------------

 using E = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. c is speed of light, about 3e8 m/s.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9) 



---------------

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 486.1e-9 m: 1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 = Let

---------------

's compute that.

486.1e-9 is 4.861e-7 m. So 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = approximately

---------------

 (1.9878 / 4.861) * 1e-18.

1.9878 / 4.861 ≈ 0.41,

---------------

 so E ≈ 0.41e-18 J. That's 4.1e-19 J.

But wait, I

---------------

 should check the exact value. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, another approach: 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So I

---------------

 can compute E in eV.

E = (12400 eV·nm) / λ in nm.

λ

---------------

 is 486.1 nm.

So E = 12400 / 486.1 ≈ 

---------------

25.5 eV. Wait, that can't be right. Wait no, 486 nm is about

---------------

 2.5 eV? Wait, no, wait: 12400 eV·nm is the

---------------

 product hc in eV·nm. So E (eV) = 12400 / λ(nm).

So 

---------------

12400 / 486.1 ≈ let's compute that.

486.1 is

---------------

 approximately 486, so 12400 / 486 ≈ 25.52

---------------

 eV? Wait, that can't be right. Because the visible spectrum is about 1.5 to 3 eV. Wait

---------------

, I'm confused.

Wait, no, 486 nm is in the visible range, which is about 2.5 eV.

---------------

 Wait, let me compute it accurately.

12400 / 486.1 = let's compute 

---------------

12400 ÷ 486.1.

Well, 486 * 25 is 12150. 12400-12150=250. So 25 + 250/486.1 ≈ 25 + 0.514 ≈ 25.514 eV. Hmm

---------------

, that's about 25.5 eV. But wait, that's way higher than typical hydrogen transition energies. Wait

---------------

, no, because the Balmer series transition is from n=2 to n=3 or something? Wait, the Balmer-alpha line is about

---------------

 486 nm, which is the transition from n=4 to n=2. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So the

---------------

 transition from n=4 to n=2 would be E4 - E2 = (-13.6 / 16) - (-13.6 /4 ) = (-0.85) + 3.4 = 2.55 eV. So

---------------

 why am I getting 25 eV when I calculate with the wavelength?

Ah! Oh wait, I think I made

---------------

 a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check. 486 nm is 486e-9 meters. So

---------------

 E = hc/λ.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
λ = 486e-9 m

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486e-9) = (1.9878e-25) / (486e-9) = 1.9878e-25 / 4.86e-7 = approximately

---------------

 4.1e-19 J.

Wait, but converting J to eV: 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 4.1e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.56 eV. Oh

---------------

, okay, that makes sense. So ΔE is about 2.56 eV.

Wait, but that's

---------------

 the energy of the photon, which is the transition energy. So ΔE is about 2.56 eV.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term is

---------------

 the Zeeman energy shift. The formula is ΔE_zeeman = μ_B * B * m, where m is the magnetic quantum number. But

---------------

 wait, I'm not sure about the exact expression. Alternatively, it's given by the expectation value of the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field. The paramagnetic term (

---------------

orbital contribution) is H_p = (e^2 B)/(8π m_e c) * L · B, but

---------------

 since B is along Oz, it becomes proportional to m. So H_p = μ_B * B * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

Wait

---------------

, μ_B is (eħ)/(2 m_e), and for orbital angular momentum, the expectation value is μ_B * m * B. So

---------------

 the energy shift is ΔE_p = μ_B * B * m.

But wait, what's the value of μ_B? Let me recall

---------------

. μ_B ≈ 9.274e-24 J/T.

So B is 1 T. So

---------------

 ΔE_p = 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T * m.

But what's m? The problem says m is small. Let

---------------

's think about possible m values in hydrogen. For example, in the ground state, l=0, so m=0. For

---------------

 l=1 (p orbital), m can be -1, 0, +1. For l=2 (d orbital), m can

---------------

 be -2, -1, 0, +1, +2. But since the problem says small m, perhaps m is 

---------------

0 or ±1.

Wait, but the problem is about the hydrogen atom. Let's think about which transition this wavelength corresponds to. The

---------------

 wavelength λ=0.4861 μm is the Balmer-alpha line, which is the transition from n=4 to n=2, so

---------------

 the energy difference is about 2.55 eV, as we calculated earlier.

In that transition, the possible m values would

---------------

 depend on the angular momentum change. For hydrogen, the transition from n=4 to n=2 can involve l values changing

---------------

 from, say, l=2 to l=1, or other possibilities. Let's say for the transition, the m

---------------

 values could be such that the change in m is zero, but perhaps that's not directly relevant here.

But the question is about the paramagnetic term for

---------------

 a given state. So for each state, the paramagnetic term would be ΔE_p = μ_B * B * m. But

---------------

 since m can be small, like m=0 or ±1, we can compute that.

Wait, but if m is 0, then ΔE_p is zero. But

---------------

 the question says m is small, not necessarily zero. So perhaps m is ±1. Let's proceed with m=1.

So ΔE_p = μ_B * B * m = (9.274e-24 J/T) * 1 T * 1 = 9.274e-24 J.

But

---------------

 wait, what about the actual value of m in the state? Because for a given state, m can be from -l to +l. But

---------------

 the problem doesn't specify the state, just that m is small. So perhaps we can assume m=1.

So let

---------------

's compute ΔE_p in eV. 9.274e-24 J is equal to 9.274e-24 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 5.79e-5 eV. So about 5.8e-5 eV.

Wait

---------------

, and the transition energy ΔE is about 2.56 eV. So comparing 5.8e-5 eV to 2.56 eV, the paramagnetic term is much smaller. So the

---------------

 paramagnetic term is much less than the transition energy.

But wait, the question is about the order of magnitude. So which

---------------

 is bigger, the paramagnetic term or the transition energy? Since the paramagnetic term is about 1e-4 eV, and the transition is 2.56 eV, the paramagnetic term is much smaller.

So

---------------

 the paramagnetic term H_p is much less than ΔE.

Wait, but wait. What's the question exactly? It says to

---------------

 compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy ΔE.

So if H_p is the paramagnetic term, which is much

---------------

 smaller than ΔE, then ⟨H⟩ (the expectation value of the paramagnetic term) is much less than ΔE. So the answer would be C) ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE.

Wait, but the

---------------

 question says "compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with transition energy ΔE". So the paramagnetic term is H

---------------

_p, and it's much smaller than ΔE.

So the correct option would be C) ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE.


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters:

1. **Transition Energy (\( \Delta E \))**:  
   The transition energy corresponds to a wavelength \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} \). Using the formula \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we calculate:  
   \[
   E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{486.1 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 4.1 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):  
   \[
   \Delta E \approx \frac{4.1 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.56 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term (\( \langle H \rangle \))**:  
   The paramagnetic term arises from the Zeeman effect and is given by \( \langle H \rangle = \mu_B \cdot B \cdot m \), where \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton, \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \), and \( m \) is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Since \( m \) is small (e.g., \( m = 1 \)), we calculate:  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle = (9.274 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \approx 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Converting to electron volts:  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle \approx \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

3. **Comparison**:  
   The transition energy \( \Delta E \approx 2.56 \, \text{eV} \) is significantly larger than the paramagnetic coupling term \( \langle H \rangle \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \). Thus, the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy.

The correct option is:  
**C) \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \).**
