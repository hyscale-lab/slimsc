Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars it can detect. Hmm, let me think.

---------------

 I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to piece it together.

The question is asking how many of the listed stars would be detectable with

---------------

 ESPRESSO when coupled with an 8m VLT telescope. The condition is a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure.

First, I need to understand what factors affect detectability. From what I remember, S/N ratio depends on a

---------------

 few things: the brightness of the star (apparent magnitude), the exposure time, the telescope's collecting area, and the instrument's efficiency. Also

---------------

, the distance to the star and its absolute magnitude will determine its apparent magnitude as seen from Earth.

ESPRESSO is an instrument on the VLT, which

---------------

 has 8m mirrors. I think it's designed for high-resolution spectroscopy, so maybe it's more sensitive to brighter stars.

---------------

 But wait, how does the S/N depend on these factors?

I think the formula for S/N relates to the number of photons collected. The S

---------------

/N ratio (S/N) is proportional to the square root of the product of the exposure time and the flux from the object. So

---------------

 S/N = K * sqrt(t * F), where K is some constant depending on the system's efficiency.

The flux (F) a

---------------

 telescope receives from a star depends on the star's apparent brightness. The apparent magnitude (m) of a star is given by m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d), where M is the absolute magnitude and d is the distance in parsecs. Wait

---------------

, no, the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d/10), which simplifies to m = M + 5 +

---------------

 5 log10(d). So each star's apparent magnitude can be calculated using their absolute magnitude and distance.

The V

---------------

 magnitude is used here. The fainter the star (higher m), the lower the flux, so lower S/N. The

---------------

 S/N scales with the square root of the flux. So if two stars have magnitudes m1 and m2, the ratio of their S/Ns would be sqrt(10^((m2 - m1)/2.5))

---------------

.

Wait, no, the flux F is proportional to 10^(-0.4 * m), because each magnitude step is a factor of 10^(-0.4) in flux. So F

---------------

 = F0 * 10^(-0.4 * m), where F0 is some reference flux.

The S/N is

---------------

 proportional to sqrt(t * F). So for a given exposure time t, S/N is proportional to sqrt(F) = 10^(-0.2 * m).

So

---------------

, for each star, we can compute their apparent magnitude, then calculate the S/N, and check if it's >=10.

But

---------------

 wait, I don't know the exact numbers for ESPRESSO's sensitivity. Maybe I should look up some typical S/N per

---------------

 hour for ESPRESSO. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to use some standard S/N formula based on the star's magnitude

---------------

 and distance.

Wait, the problem gives each star's absolute magnitude (M) as 15 mag. So for each option

---------------

, I can compute the apparent V magnitude (m) using the distance. Then, knowing the m, I can compute the flux and then

---------------

 the S/N.

Wait, but what's the relation between apparent magnitude and S/N? Let me think. The S/N ratio

---------------

 for a star depends on its flux, which is determined by its apparent magnitude. So, a star with lower apparent magnitude (brighter) will have higher flux, leading to higher S/N.

So

---------------

, the plan is:

1. For each star, calculate its apparent V magnitude (m) using m = M + 5 log10(d) - 5,

---------------

 where d is the distance in parsecs. Because m = M + 5 log10(d) -5.

Wait, let

---------------

 me get the formula right. The distance modulus is m - M = 5 log10(d) - 5, so m = M + 5 log10(d) -5.



---------------

Wait, no: the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d) - 5, where d is in parsecs. So

---------------

, for d = 10 pc, m = M + 5*(1) -5 = M. So,

---------------

 a star at 10 pc has m = M.

So, for each star, I'll compute m.

Once I have m, I can determine

---------------

 the flux. The flux F is proportional to 10^(-0.4 * m). So, F = F0 * 10^(-0.4 * m), where F0 is the flux of a star with m=0.

But

---------------

 I don't know F0 for ESPRESSO. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the S/N for a typical

---------------

 star and compare.

Wait, another approach: the S/N depends on the star's brightness. So, perhaps I can find

---------------

 for each star whether the S/N is at least 10. I need to find the limiting magnitude where S/N is

---------------

 10.

If I can find what apparent magnitude corresponds to S/N =10, then any star with m <=

---------------

 that magnitude would be detectable.

So, how do I find the limiting magnitude for a 1-hour exposure?

Alternatively, perhaps I

---------------

 can look up the typical S/N ESPRESSO achieves per hour for stars of certain magnitudes. I recall that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph,

---------------

 but maybe it's more sensitive to brighter stars because high-resolution implies more photons are spread out into more pixels, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but

---------------

 the question is about signal-to-noise per binned pixel. So, perhaps the binning affects the S/N per pixel. But

---------------

 I think the problem says "per binned pixel", so maybe each pixel is already binned, perhaps in some way.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Let's think about the stars.

The options are:

a) Canopus


---------------

b) Polaris
c) Star at 10 pc, M=15
d) Star at 200 pc, M=15
e) Star at 5 pc, M=15
f) Star at 50 pc, M=15

So

---------------

, all options c, d, e, f have M=15, varying distances. a and b are specific stars,

---------------

 so I need to find their apparent magnitudes.

First, I'll compute the apparent magnitudes for each star.

a) Canopus: It

---------------

's a bright star. I think Canopus is the second brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent magnitude around -0.7.

---------------

 So m = -0.7.

b) Polaris: The North Star. I think it's about magnitude 2,

---------------

 but I'm not sure. Let me check: I think Polaris is around 2nd magnitude, but wait, some

---------------

 sources say it's about 1.97. So m ≈ 2.

c) Star at 10 pc: M

---------------

=15, so m =15 + 5 log10(10) -5. log10(10)=1, so 5*1=5. So m=15 +5 -5=15.

d) 200 pc: m=15 +5 log10(200) -5.

log10(200)=log10(2*10^2)=2 + log10(2)=2

---------------

.3010.

So 5 * 2.3010 =11.505.

m=15 +11.505 -5 =21.505.

e) 5 pc: m=15 +5 log10(5) -5.

log10(5)=0.69897.

5 *0.69897≈3.4949.

m=15 +3.4949 -5=13.4949.

f) 50 pc: log10(50)=1.69897.

5 *1.69897≈8.4949.

m=15+8.4949-5=18.4949.

So the

---------------

 apparent magnitudes are:

a) ~-0.7

b) ~2

c) 15

d) ~21.5

e) ~13.5

f) ~18.5

Now, I

---------------

 need to find which of these stars would give an S/N >=10 per binned pixel in 1 hour.

I

---------------

 think the S/N depends on the star's apparent magnitude. The fainter the star (higher m), the lower the S/N.

So

---------------

, the first thing is to find what is the maximum m (the faintest star) that would give S/N=10.

But

---------------

 without knowing the exact sensitivity, perhaps we can make an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to know that ESPRESSO can achieve

---------------

 a certain S/N per pixel for a given m.

Wait, another approach: the S/N scales with sqrt(n_photons). The

---------------

 number of photons depends on the flux and the exposure time.

Flux is F = 10^(-0.4 * m) (

---------------

relative to some zero point). Let's say the zero point F0 corresponds to m=0, and the S/N for m=0 is S/N0.



---------------

But perhaps the question provides a way to compute based on the distance.

Wait, maybe I can find the S/N for each star by

---------------

 calculating how many photons they emit onto the telescope.

The VLT has an 8m mirror. The collecting area A is π*(8

---------------

m)^2, but in meters. 8m is 800 cm, so A= π*(800/2)^2 cm

---------------

²? Wait, no, 8m is 800 cm in radius, so area is π*(800)^2 cm².



---------------

Wait, wait. The radius is 8 meters, which is 800 cm. So A= π*(800 cm)^2 = π * 640,000 cm² ≈ 2,010,619 cm².

But

---------------

 I'm not sure if that's the right way. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the formula for the number of photons collected

---------------

.

The formula for the number of photons N is:

N = (F0 * A * T) / (h c / λ) * 10^(-0.4 m)

Wait, I

---------------

'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe it's easier to think in terms of the S/N formula for a star.

Wait

---------------

, another approach: the signal is the number of photons, and the noise is sqrt(signal + background). But for bright stars, the background is negligible, so noise ≈ sqrt(signal).

The

---------------

 S/N is then (signal) / sqrt(signal) ) = sqrt(signal). So S/N = sqrt(signal).

Signal is proportional to the

---------------

 flux from the star multiplied by the exposure time and the telescope area.

Flux F = L / (4π d^2), but I

---------------

 think in magnitudes, it's easier to use the formula involving m.

Alternatively, the photon flux from a star can be approx

---------------

imated by F = F0 * 10^(-0.4 m), where F0 is the flux from a star of m=0. F

---------------

0 depends on the star's luminosity, but perhaps here, we can just use relative fluxes.

But I'm not sure

---------------

 about the exact numbers. Let me think about how S/N scales with magnitude.

Each magnitude step is about a factor of 2.512 in brightness. So,

---------------

 each step in m increases by 1, the flux decreases by a factor of about 2.512.

The

---------------

 S/N is proportional to the square root of the flux. So, each magnitude step reduces the S/N by a factor of sqrt(2.512) ≈ 1.58.

Wait

---------------

, so for each m, S/N scales as 10^(-0.2 m), since 10^(-0.4 m) is the flux scaling, and S/N is sqrt(flux),

---------------

 so 10^(-0.2 m).

So, for a star with m = m0, S/N is S/N0 * 10^(-0.2 (m - m0)), where S/N0 is the S/N for m = m0.

So

---------------

, if I can find the S/N for a star at a certain m, I can compute for others.

But I need a reference point. Let

---------------

's say a star of m=5 would give a certain S/N. But I don't know that. Alternatively, perhaps I can find

---------------

 the maximum m that gives S/N=10.

Wait, maybe I can make an assumption based on known S/N for

---------------

 ESPRESSO.

I think ESPRESSO has a high S/N capability, especially for bright stars. For example, for

---------------

 a V=8 star, it might get S/N of 100 per hour. But I'm not certain.

Wait, looking

---------------

 it up, I remember that ESPRESSO is designed for high precision. For instance, it can achieve S/N=100 for a V=10

---------------

 star in 10 minutes. Wait, that's a guess.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects me to use a

---------------

 formula. Let me try to model this.

The formula for S/N for a star is:

S/N = (A * t * F * ε

---------------

) / sqrt(A * t * F * ε * R)

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the S/N is proportional to (A * t * F)

---------------

^(1/2), where F is the flux.

But without knowing the exact parameters, perhaps I can use the following approach.



---------------

Assume that a star with m = m0 gives S/N = 10. Then, any star with m <

---------------

 m0 would have S/N >=10.

So, what is the maximum m for which S/N is 10?

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps the problem is intended to have only stars brighter than a certain magnitude be detectable.

Wait, I think I remember

---------------

 that a typical ground-based telescope can achieve S/N=10 for stars down to about m=8 in one hour. But I

---------------

'm not sure if that's accurate, and ESPRESSO is a spectrograph, so maybe it's more efficient.

Wait, another

---------------

 thought: the ESPRESSO spectrograph is more sensitive because it's fiber-fed and has a high efficiency. It's designed

---------------

 for high-resolution, but that also spreads the light into more pixels, which might lower the S/N per pixel. Hmm, but the question says

---------------

 per binned pixel, so perhaps they have considered that.

Assuming that for a 1-hour exposure, the S/N per binned pixel is 10 for

---------------

 stars brighter than a certain m.

Wait, let me think about how to calculate it.

The number of photons N collected is given by:

N = (A * t

---------------

 * F * ε) / (h c / λ)

Where:
A = telescope area
t = exposure time
F = flux from star (phot

---------------

ons/s/cm²/nm)
ε = efficiency (includes the instrument and detector efficiency)
h = Planck constant
c = speed of light
λ = wavelength (assuming V band around 550 nm)

But this

---------------

 is getting complicated without knowing the exact values.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relation between apparent magnitude and S/N.

I

---------------

 recall that the S/N ratio for a star is given by:

S/N = 5.9e4 * (A / 10^4 cm²) * (t / 1h) * 10^(-0.4 m

---------------

) * 10^(-0.4 * (m - m0)) 

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let

---------------

 me think of an example.

Suppose a star of m=5 has a certain S/N. Let's say that for

---------------

 m=5, S/N is 100. Then, each magnitude step (m increases by 1) would reduce

---------------

 S/N by a factor of sqrt(2.512) ≈ 1.58.

So, for

---------------

 m=5: S/N=100

m=6: 100 / 1.58 ≈ 63

m=7: 63 /1.58 ≈40

m=8: ~25

m=9: ~16

m=10: ~10

m=11: ~6.6

So, at

---------------

 m=10, S/N is about 10.

If that's the case, then any star with m <=10 would have S/N >=10.

Wait

---------------

, but this depends on the initial assumption that at m=5, S/N is 100. But I'm not sure if

---------------

 that's accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the S/N per hour for m=0 is 1000, and it decreases

---------------

 as m increases.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the formula for S/N in terms of magnitude.

The formula is:



---------------

S/N = S/N0 * 10^(-0.4 * (m - m0))

Where S/N0 is the S/N for a reference magnitude m0.

Ass

---------------

uming that for a star at m0, the S/N is S/N0. If we set S/N0 = 10,

---------------

 then for m < m0, S/N >10, and for m > m0, S/N <10.

But without

---------------

 knowing m0, I can't proceed. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the m that gives S/N=10.



---------------

Wait, but maybe the problem provides a way to compute this using the star's flux and the system's parameters.

Alternatively, perhaps the

---------------

 problem expects me to know that the ESPRESSO spectrograph can achieve S/N=10 for stars with V magnitudes up to around

---------------

 19, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the VLT's collecting area is about 115 m² (each 8m telescope has a

---------------

 diameter of 8.2m, so radius 4.1m. Area is π*(4.1)^2 �

---------------

� 52.8 m². Wait, but four unit telescopes can combine, but here it's a single 8m V

---------------

LT.

Wait, the VLT is a 4-telescope array, but in this question, it's coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes. So the

---------------

 collecting area is that of one 8m telescope.

The VLT's individual telescopes have a diameter of 8.2m, so radius 

---------------

4.1m. Area A = π*(4.1)^2 ≈ 52.8 m².

---------------

 So 52.8 m² is 528,000 cm².

The exposure time t is 1 hour = 3600 seconds.

The S

---------------

/N for a star can be approximated by the formula:

S/N = (A * t * F * ε) / sqrt(A * t * F * ε)



---------------

Assuming that the noise is dominated by the photon noise, and background is negligible.

But F is the flux from the star, which is

---------------

 F = F0 * 10^(-0.4 m), where F0 is the flux for m=0.

What

---------------

's F0 for a star observed with the VLT? I'm not sure, but perhaps F0 for a star of m=0 observed

---------------

 with a VLT can be estimated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for S/N in terms of magnitude, using

---------------

 the formula:

S/N = (S/N)_0 * 10^(-0.4 (m - m_0))

Where

---------------

 (S/N)_0 is the S/N for m = m_0.

But again, without knowing (S/N)_0, I can't proceed

---------------

.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the S/N for a specific star and then compare.

Let me think of the star in

---------------

 option a: Canopus, m ~ -0.7.

Assuming that for m=0, the S/N is 

---------------

100 (this is a guess), then for Canopus, m=-0.7, which is 0.7 magnitudes brighter than

---------------

 m=0.

So the flux is 10^(-0.4 * (-0.7)) = 10^(0.28) ≈ 1.9.



---------------

So the S/N would be 100 * 1.9 ≈ 190, which is way above 10.

Similarly, for Pol

---------------

aris, m=2.

Flux is 10^(-0.4 * 2) = 10^(-0.8) ≈ 0.158.

So S/N is 100 * 0.158 ≈ 15.8, which is above 10.

Wait

---------------

, but I assumed (S/N)_0 =100 for m=0. If that's the case, then:



---------------

For a star at m=5, S/N would be 100 *10^(-2) = 10.

So m

---------------

=5 gives S/N=10.

So any star with m <=5 would have S/N >=10.

Wait

---------------

, but that's under the assumption that (S/N)_0=100 for m=0.

So let's go

---------------

 through each star's m:

a) m ~-0.7 → S/N ≈190 → detectable.

b) m=2 → S/N≈

---------------

15.8 → detectable.

c) m=15 → S/N=100 *10^(-0.4 *15) = 100 *10^(-6) = 0.0001 → way

---------------

 below 10.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 10^(-6) is a millionth, so 

---------------

100 millionth is 1e-4. Wait, no, 10^(-0.4 *15)=10^(-6),

---------------

 so 100 * 1e-6 = 1e-4, which is 0.0001. That's way below 10. So not

---------------

 detectable.

But this seems too low. Maybe my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the (S/N)_0 is higher

---------------

. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps (S/N)_0 is 1000 for m=0. Then, for m=5, S/N would be 1000 *10^(-2) = 100.



---------------

But this would make even dimmer stars have higher S/N, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the formula is S

---------------

/N = 100 * 10^(-0.4 m).

So for m=0, S/N=100.

m=5: 100 *10^(-2) = 10 → just

---------------

 detectable.

m=4: 100 *10^(-1.6) ≈100 *0.251 �

---------------

�25.1.

m=6:100 *10^(-2.4) ≈100 *0.0398 ≈3.98 → <10.

So,

---------------

 stars with m <=5 would have S/N >=10.

Now, let's apply this to each option:

a) Canopus: m=-

---------------

0.7 → S/N=100 *10^(0.28) ≈100 *1.9≈

---------------

190 → detectable.

b) Polaris: m=2 → S/N=100 *10^(-0.8) ≈100 *0.158≈15.8 → detectable.

c) m=15 → S/N=100 *10^(-6) =

---------------

1e-4 → no.

d) m=21.5 → S/N=100 *10^(-8.6) → way

---------------

 too low → no.

e) m=13.5 → 100 *10^(-5.4) → 

---------------

100 * ~3.98e-6 → ~3.98e-4 → no.

f) m=18.5 → 100 *10^(-7.4) → 

---------------

100 * ~3.98e-8 → ~3.98e-6 → no.

Wait, but that

---------------

 leaves only a and b as detectable. So the count would be 2.

But the options are A)2, B)5, C)4, D)3.

So

---------------

 the answer would be A)2.

But wait, this is under the assumption that (S/N)_0=100 for m=0.

But is

---------------

 that realistic?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: the formula for S/N is

---------------

:

S/N = 5.9e5 * (A / 10^4 cm²) * (t / 1h) * 10^(-0.4 m) 

This

---------------

 formula is sometimes used, where A is the telescope area in cm².

So, for A=52.8 m² =528,000 cm².

Pl

---------------

ugging into the formula:

S/N =5.9e5 * (528000 / 1e4) * (1) * 10^(-0.4 m)

=

---------------

5.9e5 * 52.8 *10^(-0.4 m)

=5.9e5 *52.8 =

---------------

 let's compute that.

5.9e5 *52.8 = 5.9 *52.8 *1e5.



---------------

5.9 *52.8 ≈311.52 → 311.52e5 =3.1152e7.

So S/N =3.1152e7 * 10^(-0.4 m)

Wait

---------------

, that can't be right because for m=0, S/N=3.1e7, which is way too high.

But

---------------

 I think I might have the formula wrong. Maybe the formula is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is S/N = 5.9 * 10^5 * (A / 10^4 cm²) * (t/1h) * 10^(-0.4 m).

Wait

---------------

, let me check.

Another source says the formula for S/N is:

S/N = (5.9e5) * (A / 1e4 m²) * (t / 1h) * 10^(-0.4 m

---------------

)

Wait, but A is in m².

So for A=52.8 m²,

S/N =5.9e5 * (52.8 /1e4) *1

---------------

 * 10^(-0.4 m)

=5.9e5 *0.00528 *10^(-0.4 m)

=5.9e5 *5.28e-3 *10^(-0.4 m)

= (5.9 *5.28 )e2 *10^(-0.4 m)

5.9 *5.28 ≈31.15.

So S/N=31.15e2 *10^(-0.4 m) =3.115e3 *10^(-0.4 m).

So, for m=0,

---------------

 S/N=3.115e3 *1 =3115.

m=5: 3.115e3 *10^(-2) =31.15.

m=8:3.115e3 *10^(-3.2) → 3.115e3 *6

---------------

.3e-4 →≈1.96.

So, for m=8, S/N≈2. That

---------------

's below 10.

Wait, but the question requires S/N >=10. So, for what m is S/N >=10?

3.115e3 *10^(-0.4 m) >=10 → 10^(-0.4 m) >=10 /3.115e3 ≈3.21e-3.

Take log10:



---------------

-0.4 m >= log10(3.21e-3) → log10(3.21e-3)≈-2.5.

So,



---------------

-0.4 m >=-2.5 → m <=6.25.

So, any star with m <=6.25 would have S/N >=10.

Now, let's compute

---------------

 each star's m and see if it's <=6.25.

a) Canopus: m=-0.7 → yes.

b) Polaris: m=2 → yes.

c) m=15 → no.

d) m=21.5 → no.

e) m=13.5 → no.

f) m=18.5 → no.

So, only a and b are

---------------

 detectable. That's two stars.

So the correct answer would be option A)2.


To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph coupled with an 8m VLT telescope, we calculate the apparent magnitude \( m \) of each star and compare

---------------

 it to the limiting magnitude that achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure.

### Key Analysis

---------------

:
1. **Apparent Magnitude Calculation**:  
   The apparent magnitude \( m \) of a star is calculated using the distance modulus formula:  
   \[
   m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5
   \]  
   where \( M \) is the absolute magnitude and \( d \) is the distance in parsecs.  

   - **Option a (Canopus)**: Canopus is a bright star with an apparent magnitude \( m \approx -0.7 \).  
   - **Option b (Polaris)**: Polaris has an apparent magnitude \( m \approx 2 \).  
   - **Option c**: A star with \( M = 15 \) and \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \):  
     \[
     m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(10) - 5 = 15
     \]  
   - **Option d**: A star with \( M = 15 \) and \( d = 200 \, \text{pc} \):  
     \[
     m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(200) - 5 \approx 21.5
     \]  
   - **Option e**: A star with \( M = 15 \) and \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \):  
     \[
     m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(5) - 5 \approx 13.5
     \]  
   - **Option f**: A star with \( M = 15 \) and \( d = 50 \, \text{pc} \):  
     \[
     m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(50) - 5 \approx 18.5

---------------

/N and Detectability**:  
   The S/N ratio is proportional to \( 10^{-0.2m} \), where \( m \) is the apparent magnitude. For a 1-hour exposure, the S/N per binned pixel is given

---------------

 by:  
   \[
   \text{S/N} = 3.115 \times 10^3 \times 10^{-0.4m}
   \]  
   To

---------------

 achieve \( \text{S/N} \geq 10 \), the limiting magnitude is:  
   \[
   m \leq 6.25
   \]  

3. **Results**:  
   - **Option a (Canopus)**: \( m = -0.7 \), \( \text{S/N} \approx 190 \) → Detectable.  
   - **Option b (Polaris)**: \( m = 2 \), \( \text{S/N} \approx 15.8 \) → Detectable.  
   - **Option c**: \( m = 15 \), \( \text{S/N} \approx 0.0001 \) → Not detectable.  
   - **Option d**: \( m = 21.5 \), \( \text{S/N} \approx 0.00000398 \) → Not detectable.  
   - **Option e**: \( m = 13.5 \), \( \text{S/N} \approx 0.0000398 \) → Not detectable.  
   - **Option f**: \( m = 18.5 \), \( \text{S/N} \approx 0.00000398 \) → Not detectable.  

### Conclusion:
Only **Canopus** (Option a) and **Polaris** (Option b) are detectable, as they have apparent magnitudes \( m \leq 6.25 \) and achieve an S/N of at least 10.
