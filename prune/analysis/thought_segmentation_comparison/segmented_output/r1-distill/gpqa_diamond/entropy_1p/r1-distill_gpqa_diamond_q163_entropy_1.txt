Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, binary stars... I remember they orbit around a common center of mass. The question is about determining which system is more massive and by what factor. Let me try to break this down.

So, the problem says there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses with different periods: system_1 has a period of 2 years, and system_2 has 1 year. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses. Then, there are radial velocity (RV) measurements. For system_1, the velocities have amplitudes of 10 and 5 km/s. System_2's are 15 and 10 km/s.

Wait, I think the radial velocity method in binary stars is

---------------

 used to find the masses of the stars. Because each star's velocity is measured, and from that, you can find their masses. The more massive star would have a smaller velocity because it's closer to the center of mass.

I remember Kepler's third law might come into play here. The formula for the orbital period and

---------------

 the masses. Let me think. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M1 + M2)) * a³, where 'a' is the separation between the two stars. But wait, in binary systems, the velocity

---------------

 of each star is related to the mass. There's another relation: the velocities of the two stars are inversely proportional to their masses. So v1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) * V, where V is the orbital speed related to the period and separation.

Alternatively, I recall that the sum of the velocities of the two stars is proportional to the total mass. Because the more massive star moves slower. So, for each system, the sum

---------------

 of the RV amplitudes (v1 + v2) would be proportional to the mass function, which relates to the total mass of the system.

Wait, no, actually

---------------

 the RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitudes, K1 and K2, for each star. The mass function for

---------------

 a spectroscopic binary is given by (M2^3 sin^3 i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ), but when

---------------

 you have both stars' velocities, maybe I can find the mass ratio first.

Wait, the mass ratio q is M2/M1. Oh

---------------

, right! Because in a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. So the more massive star is closer to the center, moving slower. So the velocities are inversely proportional to their masses.

So, for each system, the velocities of the two stars (K1 and K2) should satisfy K1/K2 = M2/M1. Because the more massive star has a smaller velocity.

Wait, let me get that right. Let's say M1 is the mass of the first star, M2 the second. The center of mass is at (M1 * a1) = (M2 * a2), where a1 and a2 are the distances from the center. So a1/a2 = M2/M1. Their velocities are v1 = (2π a1)/P and v2 = (2π a2)/P. So v1/v2 = a1/a2 = M2/M1. So K1/K2 = M2/M1.

So for each system, the ratio of the two RV amplitudes gives the inverse of the mass ratio.

So for system_1: K1 = 10 km/s, K2 =5 km/s. So K1/K2 = 2. So M2/M1 = 2. So M1/M2 = 1/2. So the mass ratio q = M2/M1 = 2. So M2 is twice as massive as M1 in system_1.

Wait, but wait, the

---------------

 sum of the masses is M1 + M2. So for system_1, M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1. So the total mass is 3 M1.

Similarly, in system_2, K1 is 15 and K2 is 10. So K1/K2 = 15/10 = 3/2. So M2/M1 = 3/2. So M2 = 1.5 M1. So the total mass is M1 + M2 = M1 + 1.5 M1 = 2.5 M1.

Wait, but wait a second. In

---------------

 system_1, K1 is larger than K2. So K1 is the velocity of star 1, and K2 is star 2. So if

---------------

 K1 is larger, that means star 1 is less massive than star 2. Because K1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) * V, where V is the orbital speed. So higher

---------------

 K means lower mass for that star.

So in system_1, K1=10, K2=5. So star 1 has higher velocity, so it's less massive than star 2. So M2 is twice M1.

In system_2, K1=15, K2=10. So K1/K2=3/2. So M2= (2/3) M1? Wait, wait no. Wait, the ratio is K1/K2 = M2/M1. So if K1=15, K2=10, then 15/10 = 3/2 = M2/M1. So M2 = (3/2) M1. So M1 is smaller than M2.

Wait, no

---------------

, because if K1 is higher, that would mean M2 is bigger. Because M2 is in the numerator. So yes

---------------

, M2 is larger than M1.

So for system_1: M2 = 2 M1. So M_total = 3 M1.

System_2: M2 = 1.5 M1. So M_total = 2.5 M1.

Wait, but how does this relate to the period? Because the period is given for each system. How

---------------

 does the period tie into the mass?

Ah, right, the period is the same as the orbital period. So the period P is related to the masses and the separation. Using Kepler's third law: P² = (4π² G)⁻¹ * (a³ (M1 + M2)).

But wait, I

---------------

 think for binary stars, the formula is P² (M1 + M2) = (4 π² a³) / G. So a

---------------

³ is proportional to (M1 + M2) P².

But how does that help me? I'm trying to find the ratio of the total masses of the two systems.

Wait, perhaps I can find the mass function for each system, but since we have both stars' velocities, maybe I can find the actual masses.

Wait, but the

---------------

 problem is asking by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So the question is (M_system_1) / (M_system_2) = ?

Each system's mass is the sum of the two stars. So for system_1, M_total_1 = M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1.

For system_2, M_total_2 = M1' + M2' = M1' + 1.5 M1' = 2.5 M1'.

Wait, but M1 and M1' are different for each system. So I can't directly compare 3 M1 and 2.5 M1'. I need another relation.

Hmm, perhaps I can use the fact

---------------

 that the period relates to the masses and separation.

Wait, another approach. Since in each system, the two stars are orbiting each other with a certain period. The separation

---------------

 'a' can be found from the velocity and period. Because the orbital velocity v is 2π a / P.

Wait, but wait, each star has a velocity. So the actual separation is a1 + a2 = a, the total separation.

Because

---------------

 each star orbits the center of mass, their orbits are a1 and a2, with a1 + a2 = a.

So for each system, a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) a, and a2 = (M1/(M1+M2)) a.

The velocities are v1 = 2π a1 / P, v2 = 2π a2 / P.

So, for system_1:

v1 = 10 km/s = 2 π (M2/(M1+M2)) a / P1

v2 = 5 km/s = 2 π (M1/(M1+M2)) a / P1

Similarly, for system_2:

v1 =15 km/s = 2 π (M2'/(M1'+M2')) a' / P2

v2 =10 km/s = 2 π (M1'/(M1'+M2')) a' / P2

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I can find a ratio of the masses and

---------------

 then find the total mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate the velocities and periods to the masses. Let me think.

Wait

---------------

, for each system, the sum of the velocities is v1 + v2 = 2 π (a1 + a2) / P = 2 π a / P. But a is the separation between the stars.

So, v

---------------

1 + v2 = (2 π a) / P. So a = (v1 + v2) P / (2 π).

But from Kepler's third law, (a1 + a2)^3 / P^2 = (G (M1 + M2)) / (4 π²).

Wait, because

---------------

 Kepler's third law is P² = (4 π² a³) / (G (M1 + M2)).

So substituting a from the velocity equation into Kepler's law.

a = (v1 + v2) P / (2 π)

So a³ = [ (v1 + v2) P / (2 π) ]³

Substitute into Kepler's law:

P² = (4 π²) [ (v1 + v2) P / (2 π) ]³ / (G (M1 + M2)) )

Hmm, let's work this out.

Let me rewrite Kepler's law as:

M1 + M2 = (4 π² a³) / (G P² )

Substituting a from the velocity equation:

M1 + M2 = (4 π² [ (v1 + v2) P/(2 π) ]³ ) / ( G P² )

Simplify the equation.

Let me compute the numerator:

(4 π²) * [ (v1 + v2)³ P³ / (8 π³) ) ] 

= 4 π² * (v1 + v2)³ P³ / (8 π³)

= (4 /8 ) * (π² / π³) ) * (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 

= (1/2) * (1/π) ) * (v1 + v2)^3 P^3

So numerator is ( (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 ) / (2 π )

Denominator is G P^2.

So overall,

M1 + M2 = [ (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 / (2 π) ) ] / ( G P^2 )

= (v1 + v2)^3 P / (2 π G )

So,

M_total = ( (v1 + v2)^3 P ) / ( 2 π G )

Wait, this seems promising. So the total mass is proportional to (v1 + v2)^3 * P, divided by constants.

So for each system, M_total is proportional to (v1 + v2)^3 * P.

Wait, but we

---------------

 can ignore the constants because we're looking for a ratio between the two systems.

So, M1_total / M2_total = [ (v1_1 + v2_1)^3 * P1 ] / [ (v1_2 + v2_2)^3 * P2 ]

Let me plug in the numbers.

System_1: v1 =10, v2=5. So v1+v2=15. P1=2 years.

System_2: v1=15, v2=10. So v1+v2=25. P2=1 year.

So,

M1/M2 = [ (15)^3 * 2 ] / [ (25)^3 * 1 ]

Compute each part:

15^3 = 3375

25^3 = 15625

So,

M1/M2 = (3375 * 2) / (15625 * 1 )

= 6750 / 15625

Simplify this fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 6750 ÷25=270; 15625 ÷25=625.

So 270 / 625.

Hmm, 270 ÷ 5=54; 625 ÷5=125. So 54/125.

54 ÷3=18; 125 ÷3 is not an integer. So 18/ (125/3) )

---------------

= 18/(41.666...) )= no, perhaps leave it as 54/125.

54/125 is 0.432.

So M1 is about 0.432 times M2. So system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2.

Wait, but the question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So if M1 is 0.43 M2, then system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of about 0.43.

Wait, looking at the options, the options are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, C) ~1.2, D) ~0.7.

Hmm, 0.43 is closest to option A) ~0.4. But wait, maybe

---------------

 I made a miscalculation.

Let me double-check the calculations.

Compute M1/M2 = (15^3 * 2) / (25^3 * 1 )

15^3=3375, 25^3=15625.

So (3375 * 2) = 6750.

Divided by 15625: 6750 / 15625.

Compute 15625 ÷ 6750: Let's see. 6750 × 2 =13500, which is less than 15625. 6750 ×2.3= 15525, which is very close to 15625. So 2.3 times

---------------

. So 6750 /15625 = 1/2.303... So approximately 0.433.

Yes, so 0.433. So about 0.43.

But wait, the options are A) ~0.4, D) ~0.7. So 0.43 is closer to 0.4 (option A) than to 0.7.

Wait, but wait. Let

---------------

 me re-examine the formula.

Wait, the formula I derived was M_total = (v1 + v2)^3 * P / (2 π G )

So M1 and M2 are proportional

---------------

 to (v1 +v2)^3 * P.

So the ratio is ( (v1+ v2)_1^3 * P1 ) / ( (v1 +v2)_2^3 * P2 )

Which is (15^3 * 2) / (25^3 *1 ) = (3375 *2) / (15625 *1 ) = 6750/15625=0.432.

So M1 is 0.432 times M2.

So system_1's mass is about 0.43 times that of system_2.

But the question is, "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So system_1 is less massive. So the factor is approximately 0.43, which is option A (~0.4).

But wait, let

---------------

 me check: the question says, "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2." So if system_1 is 0.43 times the mass of system_2, then it's about 0.43 times as massive. So system_1 is less massive by a factor of approximately 0.43. So the answer would be A

---------------

) ~0.4.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait another approach: For each system, the total velocity is v1 + v2. The total

---------------

 mass is M_total.

From the velocity measurements, the mass function is:

M_total = ( (v1 + v2)^3 P ) / (2 π G )

But wait, no

---------------

, that's not quite right. Because the formula for M_total is ( (v1 + v2)^3 P ) / (2 π G )

But wait

---------------

, perhaps I should have considered the mass function correctly. Another way to think about this is that the mass function is (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But since we have both K1 and K2, perhaps I can find the mass ratio directly.

Wait, another

---------------

 approach: the mass ratio q = M2/M1 = K1/K2.

In system_1: q1 = K1_1/K2_1 = 10/5 = 2.

So M2 = 2 M1.

So M_total_1 = M1 + M2 = 3 M1.

In system_2: q2 = K1_2/K2_2 =15/10=1.5.

So M2 =1.5 M1.

M_total_2 = M1 + M2 = 2.5 M1.

Wait, but now

---------------

 we have M_total_1 =3 M1 and M_total_2=2.5 M1. But these are in terms of M1, but M1 is the mass of the primary in each system, which are different. So I

---------------

 can't directly compare unless I relate M1 and M1' through the period.

Wait, but how?

Ah, perhaps using Kepler's law for each system. Let me write Kepler's law for each.

Kepler's third law: (P^2 G) / (4 π²) = a^3 / (M1 + M2)

But 'a' is the separation between the stars, which can be expressed in terms of velocities and period.

Because a = (v1 + v2) * P/(2 π )

So for system_1:

a1 = (10 +5) * 2 / (2 π ) = 15 * 2 / (2 π ) = 30/(2 π )= 15/π.

Similarly, for system_2:

a2 = (15 +10)*1/(2 π )=25/(2 π )

So,

---------------

 substituting into Kepler's law:

For system_1:

P1² = (4 π² a1³) / ( G (M1 + M2) )

Similarly

---------------

 for system_2:

P2² = (4 π² a2³ ) / ( G (M1' + M2') )

So

---------------

, taking the ratio of P1² / P2² = [ (a1³ (M1' + M2') ) ] / [ a2³ (M1 + M2) ) ]

Wait, no, more

---------------

 accurately:

P1² / P2² = [ (a1³ (M1 + M2) ) ] / [ a2³ (M1' + M2') ) ]

Wait, no, let's write

---------------

 each equation:

For system_1:

P1² = (4 π² a1³) / ( G M_total_1 )

For system_2:

P2² = (4 π² a2³ ) / ( G M_total_2 )

So, the ratio P1² / P2² = (a1³ M_total_2) / (a2³ M_total_1 )

So,

(P1² / P2² ) = (a1³ / a2³) * ( M_total_2 / M_total_1 )

Let me plug in the numbers.

P1 = 2 years, P2=1 year.

a1 =15/π, a2=25/(2 π )

So a1 =15/(3.1416) ≈4.775, a2=25/(6.283)≈3.979.

a1³ ≈4.775^3 ≈ 108.5

---------------

.

a2³ ≈3.979^3 ≈62.3.

So,

P1²/P2² = (4^2)/(1^2) )= 16/1=16.

So,

16 = (108.5 /62.3) * ( M_total_2 / M_total_1 )

Compute 108.5/62.3 ≈1.741.

So,

16 ≈ 1.741 * ( M_total_2 / M_total_1 )

So,

M_total_2 / M_total_1 = 16 / 1.741 ≈9.19.

So,

M_total_1 / M_total_2 ≈ 1/9.19 ≈0.108.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier calculation gave 0.43. There's a discrepancy here.

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, let's redo the ratio.

P1² / P2² = (a1³ / a2³ ) * ( M_total_2 / M_total_1 )

We have:

a1 = (v1 +v2) * P / (2 π ) =15 *2/(2 π )=15/π.

a2 =25 *1/(2 π )=25/(2 π )

So a1³ = (15/π )^3, a2³=(25/(2 π ))^3.

So a1³ / a2³ = (15^3 / π^3 ) / (25^3/(8 π^3 )) ) = (15^3 *8 ) / 25^3.

15^3 =3375, 25^3=15625.

So (3375 *8 ) /15625 = (27000 ) /15625 = 27000 ÷15625 = 1.728.

So,

P1²/P2² = (1.728) * ( M_total_2 / M_total_1 )

But P1 is 2, P2 is1.

So P1²/P2² =4/1=4.

So,

4 = 1.728 * ( M_total_2 / M_total_1 )

So,

M_total_2 / M_total_1 =4 / 1.728 ≈2.3148.

So,

M_total_1 / M_total_2 ≈ 1 / 2.3148 ≈0.432.

Ah! So that's consistent with the earlier calculation. So M_total_1 is about 0.43 times M_total_2.

So system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive by a factor of 0.43.

So the question is, "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" It's less, so the factor is about 0.43, which is closest to option A) ~0.4.

Wait, but the options are:

A) ~ 0.4

B) ~ 0.6

C) ~ 1.2

D) ~ 0.7

So 0.43 is closer to 0.4 than to 0.7.

So the correct answer would be option A) ~0.4.

Wait, but I

---------------

 thought I had a different approach earlier where I got 0.432, which is approximately 0.43, which would round to 0.4.

But why did I get a different initial approach when

---------------

 I tried another method? Because in the first approach, I considered the formula M_total = (v1 +v2)^3 * P / (2 π G ), which would give the mass,

---------------

 and then taking the ratio. Which gives the same result.

So, the answer is approximately 0.43, so option A is correct.


To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data using the relationship between radial velocity amplitudes, orbital periods, and total system mass. The total mass of a binary system can be expressed as:

\[
M_{\text{total}} \propto (v_1 + v_2)^3 \cdot P
\]

where \(v_1\) and \(v_2\) are the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars, and \(P\) is the orbital period.

### Step 1: Calculate the total velocity for each system
- For system_1: \(v_1 = 10 \, \text{km/s}, \, v_2 = 5 \, \text{km/s}\), so \(v_1 + v_2 = 15 \, \text{km/s}\).
- For system_2: \(v_1 = 15 \, \text{km/s}, \, v_2 = 10 \, \text{km/s}\), so \(v_1 + v_2 = 25 \, \text{km/s}\).

### Step 2: Calculate the ratio of total masses
The ratio of the total masses of the two systems is given by:

\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{(v_1 + v_2)_1^3 \cdot P_1}{(v_1 + v_2)_2^3 \cdot P_2}
\]

Substitute the values:
- \((v_1 + v_2)_1 = 15 \, \text{km/s}, \, P_1 = 2 \, \text{years}\),
- \((v_1 + v_2)_2 = 25 \, \text{km/s}, \, P_2 = 1 \, \text{year}\).

\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{15^3 \cdot 2}{25^3 \cdot 1}
\]

### Step 3: Compute the numerical values
- \(15^3 = 3375\),
- \(25^3 = 15625\),
- \(15^3 \cdot 2 = 3375 \cdot 2 = 6750\),
- \(25^3 \cdot 1 = 15625\).

\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{6750}{15625} \approx 0.432
\]

### Step 4: Interpret the result
The total mass of system_1 is approximately \(0.432\) times the total mass of system_2. This means system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of approximately \(0.43\). Among the given options, the closest value is \(0.4\).

### Final Answer:
The factor by which system_1 is less massive than system_2 is approximately **0.4**.
