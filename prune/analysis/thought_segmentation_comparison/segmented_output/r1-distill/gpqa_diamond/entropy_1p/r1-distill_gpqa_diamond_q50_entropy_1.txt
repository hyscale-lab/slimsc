Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the potential energy of a charge near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is: A charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. We need to find the net potential energy of the system. The options are given as A to D.

Alright, first, I remember that when dealing with potential energy between charges, it's often related to the work done in assembling the system. But wait, this is a conducting sphere, so I should think about how charges distribute on it.

Since the sphere is grounded, any excess charge will reside on its surface. But wait, if the sphere is neutral to begin with, grounding

---------------

 it would allow charges to flow in or out. So when a charge q is placed nearby, the conducting sphere might induce charges on its surface. But wait, if the sphere is grounded, the induced charges can leave, so the sphere's net charge remains zero. Hmm, no

---------------

, wait, wait. Or does the sphere get a charge because of the external field? Let me think again.

Wait, no. The sphere is a conductor, so the charge q will induce a charge on the sphere. But because the sphere is grounded, the induced charge can flow into the ground. So the sphere remains neutral? Or does it have an induced dipole or something else?

Wait, maybe I should think about image charges. I remember something about image charges in the method of images for solving problems with conductors. The method involves replacing the conductor with an image charge to find the potential.

So when you have a charge q outside a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge approach would model this as the charge q and an image charge -q' located somewhere inside the sphere. But wait, the

---------------

 sphere is grounded, which means its potential is zero. So the image charge method might help here.

Wait, I think the image charge for a point charge outside a conducting sphere is such that the sphere's potential is zero. The image charge would be inside the sphere, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

Alternatively, another approach: the potential at the surface of the grounded sphere is zero. So the potential due to the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere should be zero at the sphere's surface.

But wait

---------------

, the sphere is conducting, so all points on its surface are at the same potential. Since it's grounded, that potential is zero.

So the potential due to the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere must be zero at the sphere's surface.

Hmm. Let me think about the induced charges. The charge q outside the sphere will induce a charge on the sphere. Let's call the induced charge on the sphere as Q. But wait, since the sphere is grounded, any induced charge can leave, so the sphere's net charge is zero. So does that mean Q is zero? That doesn't make sense because then the potential wouldn't be zero at the surface.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing things. Let me think again. The sphere is a conductor, so charges can move freely. The charge q outside will induce a charge distribution on the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, the potential at the surface is zero, which is the same as the ground's potential.

So the potential at the surface due to q and the induced charges must be zero. So, the induced charge on the sphere must be such that the sum of potentials from q and the induced charges equals zero at the surface.

Alternatively, perhaps the image charge approach is better. The image charge would be placed at a point such that the potential due to the real charge and the image charge is zero on the sphere's surface.

Wait, the method of images says that for a conducting sphere of radius R and potential V, the image charge q' is located at a distance such that the potential at the sphere's surface is maintained. Since the sphere is grounded, V is zero.

So, the image charge would be placed inside the sphere? Or outside?

Wait, no. Let me recall. The image charge for a point charge outside a conducting sphere. The real charge is at a distance d from the center. The image charge would be on the line connecting the charge and the center of the sphere, but inside the sphere, right?

The formula for the image charge when the sphere is grounded is q' = -q (R/d), but I'm not sure. Wait, I

---------------

 think the image charge q' is given by q' = (R^2/d) * q, but with a negative sign.

---------------

 Or maybe it's (R/d) times something.

Wait, no. Let me think. The image charge method says that for a point charge outside a conducting sphere of radius R, the image charge q' is inside the sphere, located at a distance from the center such that the sphere's surface is at zero potential.

The potential at the surface due to q and q' must be zero. So, the image charge q' must be placed such that V_sphere = V_q + V_q' = 0.

The distance from the charge q to the center is d, so the distance from the image charge to the center is (

---------------

R^2)/d. Because, in the image charge method, the product of the distances from the real charge and image charge to the center is R^2. So, if the real charge is at distance d, the image is at distance R^2/d from the center but in the opposite direction.

So the image charge is located at a distance of R^2/d from the center, on the same line as q and the center, but inside the sphere.

Wait, let me confirm

---------------

. The formula is: if the real charge is at distance d from the center, the image charge is at a distance of R^2/d from the center, towards the charge. So, for example, if d > R, then R^2/d is less than R, so it's inside the sphere.

So the image charge q' is inside

---------------

 the sphere, located at a distance of (R²/d) from the center. The magnitude of the image charge is q' = (R/d) q. Wait, no. Wait, the image charge's magnitude is (R^2/d) * (something), but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the image charge is q' = - (R/d) q. Or maybe it's q' = - (R²/d) q. I'm not certain, but let's proceed.

The

---------------

 potential energy of the system would be the potential energy between the charge q and the image charge q', because the system consists of these two charges. So

---------------

 the potential energy U is k q q' / r, where r is the distance between q and q'.

Wait, but since the image charge is inside the sphere, maybe the system's potential energy is the work done to bring them together. But I'm a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, the potential energy of the system is the work done in assembling the charges. But the sphere is grounded, so perhaps the potential of the sphere is zero, so the potential energy is only due to the charge q and the image charge.

Wait, but

---------------

 the image charge is a mathematical construct, so perhaps the actual potential energy is calculated as if the image charge were present.

So, the potential energy U would be the potential energy between q and the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is a conductor, the induced charges can be considered as a single image charge located at a certain position.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the potential energy is the potential energy between the charge q and the image charge q'. Since the sphere is conducting, the potential energy is U = (1/2) k q q' / (distance between q and q').

Wait, but why

---------------

 1/2? Because when you bring charges together, you account for each pair once. So if you have two charges, the potential energy is (1/2) k q1 q2 / r, but wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, but since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero, which might affect the calculation.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the potential at the point where q is placed. The potential there would be due to q itself and the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, no. The potential at the location of q is due to the sphere's charges. But the sphere's potential is zero at its surface. So the potential at the location of q is due to the sphere's induced charges.

But perhaps

---------------

 it's easier to model it with the image charge. The image charge approach says that the potential outside the sphere is the same as if the real charge and the image charge were present.

So, the potential at the surface of the sphere is zero because of the image charge. So, the potential due to both q and the image charge q' must cancel each other at the sphere's surface.

Now, the potential energy of the system would be the potential energy stored in the configuration of the real charge and the image charge.

So, the potential energy U is the work done to bring the real charge q and the image charge q' from infinity to their positions, considering each other's presence.

Wait, but image charges are a bit abstract. Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the energy stored in the electric fields due to the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for a formula or standard

---------------

 result.

Wait, another approach: when a charge q is placed outside a grounded conducting sphere, the induced charges on the sphere create a potential such that the sphere's surface is at zero potential. The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position in the presence of the sphere.

But how to compute that?

The potential energy U can be calculated as the integral of the force over distance, but that might be complicated.

Alternatively, the potential at the location of q is due to the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is a conductor, the potential inside the conductor is constant, which is zero (because it's grounded). So the potential at the location of q is the same as the potential due to the induced charges at that point.

Wait, but the potential due to a conductor's charges outside the conductor can be considered as if all the charge were at the center, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential at the point where q is placed is equal to the potential due to the induced charge on the sphere.

But the sphere is conducting, so the induced charges arrange themselves such that the potential at the surface is zero. So, the potential at the point where q is placed (distance d from center) is due to the induced charge Q on the sphere.

Wait, but the sphere is neutral overall because it's grounded, right? So the induced charge on the sphere is -q, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the sphere would have induced charges, but because it's grounded, any excess charge can leave, so the sphere remains neutral. Hmm, maybe not. I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the sphere's induced charges are such that the potential due to them at the location of q is equal to the negative of the potential due to q at the sphere's surface.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 that's getting too complicated.

Let me try another approach. The potential energy of the system is the work done in assembling the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, the potential at the sphere's surface is zero.

The potential energy can be thought of as the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential at each point due to the induced charges on the sphere.

But the induced charges on the sphere would produce a potential at the location of q, and the work done would be q multiplied by that potential.

So, U = q * V(q), where V(q) is the potential at the location of q due to the induced charges on the sphere.

But how to find V(q)?

Alternatively, using the image charge method, the potential at the location of q due to the sphere's induced charges is the same as the potential due to the image charge q' located inside the sphere.

So, if the image charge is q', then V(q) = k q' / r, where r is the distance between q and q'.

Wait, the distance between q (at d from center) and q' (at R²/d from center, same line) is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

So, the potential at q due to q' is k q' / [(d² - R²)/d] = k q' d/(d² - R²).

But wait

---------------

, the image charge is inside the sphere, so the potential due to it at q's position is k q' / [d - (R²/d)] = k q' d/(d² - R²).

But I

---------------

'm not sure about the sign of q'. I think the image charge for a grounded sphere is negative. Wait, no, the image charge's magnitude is (R/d) q. Let me think.

Wait, the image charge method states that for a grounded sphere, the image charge q' is inside the sphere, at a distance R²/d from the center, and its magnitude is q' = (R/d) q. Wait, no, maybe it's (R^2/d) * (something).

Wait, I think I'm mixing up the formulas. Let me think again. The image charge for a conducting sphere of radius R, when a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center (d > R), is given by q' = (R^2/d) q, but with a negative sign because it's inside the sphere.

Wait, no, maybe the image charge is q' = -(R/d) q. Hmm, perhaps I should look up the image charge formula, but since I can't, I'll try to derive it.

The potential at the surface of the sphere must be zero. The potential due to the real charge q and the image charge q' must sum to zero at the sphere's surface.

So, the potential due to q at a point on the sphere's surface (say, a point at distance R from the center, along the line connecting the center and q) is V_q = k q / (d - R).

Wait, no, the distance from q to a point on the sphere's surface along that line is (d - R). So, V_q = k q/(d - R).

Similarly, the potential due to the image charge q' at that point is V_q' = k q' / (R - R'), where R' is the distance of the image charge from the center.

Wait, I

---------------

'm getting confused. Let me correct: the image charge is at a distance x from the center, in the same direction as q. So, the distance from q to the image charge is (d - x).

Wait, no, if the image charge is inside the sphere, then x is R^2/d, right? Because in the image charge method, the product of the distances from the real charge and the image charge to the center is R^2.

So, d * x = R^2 → x = R^2/d.

So, the image charge is at a distance x = R²/d from the center, towards the charge q.

So, the distance between q and q' is d - x = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d.

Now, the potential at the surface due to both charges must be zero. So, the potential from q and q' at a point on the sphere's surface (say, the point closest to q) is:

V = V_q + V_q' = 0.

So, V_q = k q / (d - R), because the distance from q to that point is (d - R).

Similarly, the image charge q' is at a distance x from the center, so the distance from q' to that point is R - x = R - (R²/d) = R (d - R)/d.

Wait, wait, no. The point on the sphere's surface is at a distance R from the center, in the same direction as q. The image charge is at x = R²/d from the center towards q.

So, the distance between the image charge and the point on the sphere's surface is R - x = R - R²/d = R (d - R)/d.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's x - R, but since x is R²/d and d > R, x is less than d but greater than R? Wait, if d > R, then x = R²/d, which is less than R,

---------------

 because R² < d R when d > R. So x is inside the sphere, closer to the center than R. Wait, no, because x is R²/d. Let's plug in numbers: if d is 2R, then x is R²/(2R) = R/2, which is inside the sphere. So the point on the sphere's surface is at R from the center, and the image charge is at R/2 from the center, same line. So the distance between the image charge and the surface point is R - (R/2) = R/2.

So the potential due to q at the surface is k q/(d - R), and the potential due to q' is k q'/(R/2).

The

---------------

 sum of these potentials must be zero because the sphere is grounded (V=0 at the surface). So,

k q/(d - R) + k q'/(R/2) = 0.

Divide both sides by k:

q/(d - R) + 2 q'/(R) = 0.

Solve for q':

2 q'/(R) = - q/(d - R)

q' = - (q R)/(2 (d - R)).

Wait, that doesn't look familiar. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the

---------------

 point on the sphere's surface is at a distance R from the center in the direction of q. The distance from q to that point is (d - R), as before.

The image charge is at x = R²/d from the center, same direction as q. So the distance from the image charge to the surface point is R - x = R - (R²/d) = R (d - R)/d.

So the potential due to q' is k q' / [R (d - R)/d] = k q' d / [R (d - R)].

So, the condition is:

k q/(d - R) + k q' d / [R (d - R)] = 0.

Factor out k/(d - R):

[ q + (q' d)/(R) ] = 0.

So,

q + (q' d)/R = 0 → q' = - (q R)/d.

Ah, that makes more sense. So the image charge is q' = - (R q)/d.

So, the image charge is negative, and its magnitude is (R q)/d.

Now, the potential energy U of the system would be the potential energy between the real charge q and the image charge q'.

The distance between them is (d - x) = d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

So, the potential energy is:

U = k q q' / r,

where r is (d² - R²)/d.

Substituting q' = - (R q)/d,

U = k q * (- R q/d) / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

Simplify:

U = k (- R q²/d) * [ d/(d² - R²) ) ]

The d in the denominator and numerator cancels:

U = - (k R q² ) / (d² - R² )

But wait, potential

---------------

 energy is usually written as U = (1/2) k q1 q2 / r when considering two charges. Wait

---------------

, no, that's when you bring the charges from infinity to their positions. Wait, but in the image charge method, I think the potential energy is just the energy between q and q', so perhaps

---------------

 I should include a 1/2 factor.

Wait, in the standard two-point-charge system, the potential energy is U = (1/2) k q1 q2 / r. But in this case, the image charge is a construction, so perhaps it's just

---------------

 the energy between the two, which would be (1/2) times the energy we calculated.

Wait, but wait. The image charge is a mathematical construct; the actual energy comes from the real charge and the induced charges on the conductor. So perhaps the energy is U

---------------

 = (1/2) k q q' / r, where q' is the image charge.

Wait, let me think. The potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So for two charges, it's (1/2) k q1 q2 / r.

In our case, the real charge q and the image charge q' (which represents the induced charges) contribute to the potential energy. So,

U = (1/2) * k * q * q' / r,

where r is the distance between q and q'.

But wait, earlier I found that q' = - (R q)/d.

So substituting,

U = (1/2) * k * q * (- R q/d) / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

Simplify denominator:

= (1/2) * k * (- R q²/d) * [ d/(d² - R²) )

= (1/2) * k * (- R q²) / (d² - R² )

= - (1/2) k R q² / (d² - R² )

Hmm, looking at the options, option C is -(1/2) k q^2 R^2/(d^2 - R^2), which isn't matching. Option D is -(1/2) k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2 ), which matches what I have except for the R in the numerator.

Wait, I

---------------

 have - (1/2) k R q^2 / (d^2 - R^2 ), which would match option D if q^2 is correct

---------------

. Let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

A) U=- (1/2) k q² d/(d² + R²)

B) U=- k q² d/(d² - R² )

C) U= -(1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R² )

D) U=- (1/2) *k q² R/(d² - R^2 )

Hmm, my result is -(1/2) k R q^2 / (d² - R^2 ), which matches option D.

Wait, but I thought the image charge was q' = - (R q)/d, so substit

---------------

uting that into U gives:

U = (1/2) k q * q' / r = (1/2) k q (-R q/d) / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

= (1/2) k (- R q²/d) * (d/(d² - R²)) )

= (1/2) (- R q²) * k / (d² - R² )

Which simplifies to - (1/2) k R q^2 / (d² - R^2 )

So yes, that matches option D.

Wait, but looking

---------------

 at the options, option D is written as U = - (1/2) k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2 ), which is exactly what I have.

So the correct answer should be option D.


To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we use the method of images for a grounded conducting sphere. When a charge \( q \) is placed at a distance \( d \) from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius \( R \), the sphere's surface remains at zero potential due to grounding. The induced charges on the sphere can be modeled as an image charge \( q' \) inside the sphere, located at a distance \( x = \frac{R^2}{d} \) from the center, along the line connecting the charge \( q \) and the center of the sphere.

The image charge \( q' \) is determined by ensuring that the total potential at the sphere's surface is zero. Using the condition for the potential at the surface, the image charge is found to be:

\[
q' = -\frac{R q}{d}.
\]

The potential energy \( U \) of the system is the energy between the real charge \( q \) and the image charge \( q' \). The distance between \( q \) and \( q' \) is:

\[
r = d - x = d - \frac{R^2}{d} = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}.
\]

The potential energy is given by:

\[
U = \frac{k q q'}{r}.
\]

Substituting \( q' = -\frac{R q}{d} \) and \( r = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d} \):

\[
U = \frac{k q \left(-\frac{R q}{d}\right)}{\frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}} = -\frac{k R q^2}{d^2 - R^2}.
\]

Since potential energy for a system of charges is typically expressed as half the energy between two charges, we include a factor of \( \frac{1}{2} \):

\[
U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k R q^2}{d^2 - R^2}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A** involves \( d^2 + R^2 \) in the denominator, which does not match the derived result.
- **Option B** lacks the factor of \( \frac{1}{2} \) and has incorrect units.
- **Option C** incorrectly includes \( R^2 \) in the numerator instead of \( R \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
