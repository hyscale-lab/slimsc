Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Wait, I

---------------

 remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So for a non-relativistic oscillator, the max speed v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m). But this is a relativistic case, so things are different because of the speed of light limit.

Relativistic effects come into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So I need to consider the relativistic equations of motion and energy.

In special relativity, the total energy E is given by gamma mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor: 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The kinetic energy is E - mc², which equals (gamma - 1) mc².

In the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy at maximum displacement is (1/2)kA². So the total energy E is (1/2)kA². But wait, in relativity, the energy expression

---------------

 might change because of the relativistic mass or the form of energy.

Wait, no, the potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore because of relativistic effects. So the total energy would be the sum of relativistic kinetic energy and potential energy.

At maximum displacement x = A, the oscillator is momentarily at rest, so all energy is potential. Then, as it moves towards the equilibrium point, potential energy converts to kinetic, reaching maximum speed when all potential is converted to kinetic. But wait, in the relativistic case, the maximum speed isn't achieved because as v approaches c, gamma increases, making kinetic energy approach

---------------

 infinity. But in this case, the oscillator is constrained by the potential, so maybe there's a point where the speed is maximum but less than c.

Wait, perhaps the approach

---------------

 is to equate the total energy at the maximum displacement with the total energy when the oscillator is at the equilibrium point (x=0) but moving at maximum speed.

So when x=A, the speed is zero, so the total energy E is (1/2)kA². But wait, in relativity, the potential energy is the same as in the classical case, but the kinetic energy is relativistic. So, when the oscillator is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic, so E = K + mc², where K is the relativistic kinetic energy.

Wait, no, wait

---------------

. Wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx². So at x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². The total energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. At x=A, the kinetic energy is zero because the velocity is zero. So E = (1/2)kA².

But in relativity, the total energy is also given by E = gamma mc². Wait, no. No, because when the oscillator is at x=A, it's at rest, so gamma is just 1, so E should be mc² + (1/2)kA². Wait, that can't be right because for small amplitudes, the potential energy is small, but the rest energy is mc². So that seems correct

---------------

.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The rest energy is mc², and when the oscillator is at x=A, all energy is potential: E = (1/2)kA². But this can't be right because then

---------------

 E would have to equal both (1/2)kA² and gamma mc². But that would mean (1/2)kA² = gamma mc², but at x=A, the velocity is zero, so gamma is 1, so (1/2)kA² = mc², which would require

---------------

 kA² = 2mc². But that's a specific condition, and the problem doesn't state that. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy. So when x=A, E = mc² + (1/2)kA². Because the rest energy is always there, and the potential adds to it. Then, when the oscillator is at x=0, the potential is zero, and the kinetic energy is at maximum. So the total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy.

So at x=0, E = mc² + K, where K is the relativistic kinetic energy. K is (gamma - 1) mc². So,

E = mc² + (gamma - 1) mc² = gamma mc².

But E is also (1/2)kA² + mc², from when x=A. So,

gamma mc² = (1/2)kA² + mc².

Subtracting mc² from both sides:

gamma mc² - mc² = (1/2)kA².

mc² (gamma -1) = (1/2) k A².

So,

gamma -1 = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Gamma

---------------

 is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) -1 = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me let

---------------

 x = v²/c². Then,

1/sqrt(1 -x) -1 = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me call (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a variable, say, alpha. So,

1/sqrt(1 -x) = 1 + alpha.

S

---------------

quaring both sides,

1/(1 -x) = (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

1 -x = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Rearranging,

x = 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2].

But x is v²/c², so,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2].

So

---------------

,

v_max = c sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2 ] )

Wait, but let me plug in alpha:

alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 ] )

Let me compute

---------------

 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2.

Wait, let me see the options. Option D is v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)))^2 ). That matches what I have here. So the correct answer would be option D.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps.

Wait

---------------

, when x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². So the total energy is E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

When the oscillator is at x=0, it's moving at maximum speed v_max. The total energy at that point is E = mc² + K, where K is relativistic kinetic energy.

So,

E = mc² + K = mc² + (gamma -1) mc² = gamma mc².

Set equal:

gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)k A².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

Hmm

---------------

, wait, wait. Because (1/2)k A^2 = (k A^2)/2, so (k A^2)/(2 m c²) is alpha.

So,

gamma = 1 + alpha.

Which is the same as earlier.

So,

gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) = 1 + alpha.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha.

Then

---------------

, solving for v²/c²:

1/(1 + alpha)^2 = 1 - v²/c².

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Which is,

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²) ) )^2 ] )

Which matches option D.

Looking at the options:

Option D) v_max = c√[1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c²))^2 ) ]

Wait, no, the denominator in the fraction is (1 + (kA²/(2mc²))) squared, yes.

So the answer should be option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we consider the relativistic energy conservation. The total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is the sum of the rest energy \( mc^2 \) and the potential energy at maximum displacement \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). Thus, at \( x = A \), the total energy is:

\[
E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

At \( x = 0 \), all the energy is converted into relativistic kinetic energy. The total energy is also given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. Equating the two expressions for \( E \), we have:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Subtracting \( mc^2 \) from both sides:

\[
\gamma mc^2 - mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Factoring out \( mc^2 \):

\[
mc^2 (\gamma - 1) = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Dividing through by \( mc^2 \):

\[
\gamma - 1 = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Let \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \alpha.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \alpha.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = (1 + \alpha)^2.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}.
\]

Thus:

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}}.
\]

Substituting \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A** and **Option B** incorrectly modify the denominator or the structure of the equation.
- **Option C** is the classical (non-relativistic) result and does not account for relativistic effects.

Thus, the correct answer is:
