Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, specifically about detecting large clouds of neutral hydrogen using ground-based optical telescopes. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question says that these clouds absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. Wait, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet range, right? Because hydrogen's Lyman series transitions are in UV. So if

---------------

 the quasar emits this light, and the hydrogen clouds absorb it, the absorption line would be shifted due to the expansion of the universe, right? So redshift comes into play here.

The main point is to find the lower limit on the redshift such that these objects can be detected with optical telescopes. Optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because the atmosphere blocks it. So the observed wavelength after redshift must be in the optical range.

Let me recall the redshift formula. The observed wavelength lambda_obs is equal to the emitted wavelength lambda_emit multiplied by (1 + z), where z is the redshift. So lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + z).

We want the Lyman alpha line (1216 Angstroms) to be in the optical range. What's the cutoff between optical and UV? I think the atmosphere is opaque to UV below about 3000 Angstroms (which is 300 nm, since 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm). So anything

---------------

 longer than that can pass through the atmosphere and be seen by ground-based telescopes.

Wait, actually, no. Let me double-check. The Earth's atmosphere is transparent to wavelengths longer than about 3000 Angstroms (300 nm) into the UV, but for

---------------

 ground-based optical, visible light is about 400-700 nm. So optical telescopes can't observe UV. So the Lyman alpha absorption line, when redshifted, needs to be in the optical, i.e., longer than 400 nm but not

---------------

 too long. Wait, actually, no—the question is about being detectable with optical telescopes. So the redshifted wavelength must be in the optical, which is longer than about 400 nm (4000 Angstroms). Wait, no, 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. So 1216 Angstroms is about 121.6 nm, which is in the far UV. So if this is redshifted into the optical, the

---------------

 observed wavelength must be above 4000 Angstroms (400 nm) because that's where optical starts.

Wait, but I

---------------

'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The observed wavelength must be in the range that optical telescopes can detect. So for

---------------

 ground-based telescopes, the observed wavelength must be longer than about 3000 Angstroms (since shorter is blocked by atmosphere). So the Lyman alpha line, at 1216 Angstroms, when redshifted, must be longer than 3000 Angstroms. Let's calculate the minimum redshift.

So, lambda_obs >= 3000 Angstroms. So

---------------

,

lambda_obs = 1216 * (1 + z) >= 3000

Divide both sides by 1216:

1 + z >= 3000 / 1216 ≈ 2.4658

So z >= ~1.4658. Wait, but wait, the

---------------

 question says 'lower limit' on the redshift. So any z higher than this would make the observed wavelength longer than 3000 Angstroms, meaning it's in the optical range. So the minimum redshift is when lambda_obs is just 3000 Angstroms. So z ≈ 1.4658, which is approximately 1.47.

Looking at the options, the choices are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Wait, none of these options match 1.47. Hmm. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, maybe I got the cutoff wrong. Maybe the optical range starts at a longer wavelength. Let me think: the atmosphere is opaque to wavelengths below about 3000 Angstroms (300 nm), which is in the UV. So for

---------------

 a ground-based telescope, to observe a wavelength in the optical, the observed wavelength must be longer than 3000 Angstroms. So the

---------------

 calculation I did is correct, which gives z ~1.47.

But none of the options are near 1.47. Let me check the options again. Option B is 1.2, which is lower than 1.47. So z=1.2 would give lambda_obs = 1216*(1+1.2)= 1216*2.2≈2675 Angstroms. Which is still in the UV (since 3000 is the cutoff). So that's below 3000, so it's not visible. So z must be higher than ~1.47. The next higher options are D)1.9 and C)2.4.

Wait, but

---------------

 the question is about the lower limit. So the minimal z is 1.47, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the cutoff wavelength.

Wait, another approach: maybe the optical range is considered to start at 400 nm (4000 Angstroms). So let's recalculate with lambda_obs >= 4000 Angstroms.

So 1216*(1+z) >=4000

1+z >= 4000/1216 ≈3.289

z >= 2.289.

So the lower limit is approximately 2.29. So looking at the options, the closest higher is option C)2.4 and D)1.9 is lower than that.

Wait, but if

---------------

 the cutoff is 3000 Angstroms, then 1.47 is the limit, but that's not an option. But if the cutoff is 4000 Angstroms, then 2.29 is the limit, which isn't an option either.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the Lyman limit or something else. Alternatively, maybe the quasar's light is being absorbed, but the rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, and when redshifted, we need it to be in the visible spectrum. So the

---------------

 observed wavelength should be greater than 400 nm (4000 Angstroms).

Wait, let me rec

---------------

alculate.

If the observed wavelength is 4000 Angstroms:

z = (4000/1216) -1 ≈ (3.289) -1 = 2.289.

So the redshift needs to be at least 2.29. So the minimal redshift is 2.29, so the lower limit is that

---------------

. The options given are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So 2.4 is option C, which is higher than 2.29. So the minimal redshift is approximately 2.29, which is close to 2.4. But wait, why

---------------

 is 2.4 the option and not 2.3 or something?

Alternatively, perhaps the cutoff is 3000 Angstroms, which gives z= (3000/1216) -1 ≈ (2.466) -1 = 1.466. So the minimal redshift is approximately 1.47.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is considering that the quasar's light is being observed in the optical. Wait, no—the quasar's light is from

---------------

 the background, but the absorption is by the hydrogen cloud. So the absorption line must be in the observed spectrum.

Wait, another angle: perhaps

---------------

 the quasar itself is at a redshift where its visible light is being observed. Wait, no, the quasar emits light across the spectrum. The absorption occurs at the Lyman alpha wavelength in the quasar's frame. So when the cloud is at a higher redshift, the absorption line is shifted further.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the rest frame of the quasar and the cloud. Let me imagine that the quasar is at a certain redshift, and the cloud is at a higher redshift. So the cloud's Lyman alpha line, when observed, is in the optical.

Wait, but the question says the clouds are absorbing the light from the background quasars. So the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud. Because the cloud is in front, so the light from the quasar passes through the cloud, which is at a lower redshift. Wait, no—wait

---------------

, the quasar is behind the cloud. So the cloud is at a higher redshift than the quasar. No, wait, higher redshift means further away. So if the cloud is between us and the quasar, then the cloud has a lower redshift than the quasar. Because the quasar is farther away.

Wait, I

---------------

'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. If the cloud is in front of the quasar, then the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar. Because the quasar is farther away. So when we observe the quasar's light, it has been redshifted more than the cloud's.

So the Lyman alpha absorption line from the cloud would be at a wavelength that is (

---------------

1 + z_cloud) * 1216 Angstroms. But the quasar's own emission lines are at (1 + z_quasar) * their rest wavelengths. So if the cloud is at z_cloud, then the absorption line is at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). We

---------------

 want this to be in the optical, so 1216*(1 + z_cloud) > 3000 Angstroms.

So z

---------------

_cloud must be >= (3000/1216) -1 ≈ 1.466.

So the minimal z_cloud is about 1.466. Now, looking at the options, the closest higher is option D)1.9, but that's larger than 1.47. Wait

---------------

, but why not pick the minimal z where it's just possible.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the quasar's own emission is in the optical, so the quasar must be at a higher redshift than the cloud. But that's a different point.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the quasar's light must have its own optical lines. But I think the main point is about the absorption line being in the optical.

Wait, but the options don't have 1.47. So perhaps I made a mistake in the cutoff.

Alternatively, maybe the question is using the Lyman break as the cutoff. The Lyman limit is about 912 Angstroms (91.2 nm), but I'm not sure that's relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the question

---------------

 is considering the Lyman-alpha forest, where absorption lines are seen in quasar spectra. But for ground-based telescopes, the observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha line must be in the optical, which is about 400-700 nm (4000-7000 Angstroms).

So let's calculate when 1216*(1+z) is in

---------------

 the optical range, say above 4000 Angstroms.

1216*(1+z) >=4000

1+z >=4000/1216 ≈3.289

z >=2.289.

So the minimal redshift is about 2.29. So the lower limit would be just above 2.29. Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.29. So if the options don't have 2.3, then 2.4 is the next possible choice.

But wait, let me recheck the calculations.

If z=2.289, then the observed wavelength is exactly 4000 Angstroms. So anything higher than that would make the wavelength longer than 4000, which is in the optical. So the lower limit is 2.289, so the minimal redshift is just over 2.29. So any option higher than that would suffice. But the question asks for the lower limit. So the minimal redshift is approximately 2.29, so the lower limit is z=2.29.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.29, so that's acceptable. So the answer would be option C)2.4.

Wait, but why

---------------

 is option D)1.9 even an option? Because if z=1.9, then 1216*(1+1.9)=1216*2.9≈3526.4 Angstroms. 3526 is in the UV (since it's less than 3000? Wait, wait no: 3000 Angstroms is 300 nm, which is the cutoff. 3526 is about 352.6 nm, which is still in the UV. So a

---------------

 redshift of 1.9 would result in observed wavelength 3526, which is below the 3000 cutoff. So it can't be detected by optical telescopes. Therefore, the redshift must be higher than ~2.29.

So the correct answer is option C)2.4.


To determine the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen such that their Lyman alpha absorption line (rest wavelength ~1216 Å) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to ensure that the redshifted wavelength falls within the optical range. Optical telescopes are sensitive to wavelengths in the range of approximately 400–700 nm (4000–7000 Å). Additionally, the Earth's atmosphere is opaque to wavelengths shorter than ~3000 Å, so the observed wavelength must be at least 3000 Å to be detectable.

The relationship between the observed wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)), the rest wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{emit}} \)), and the redshift (\( z \)) is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot (1 + z)
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the minimum redshift for detection
To ensure the Lyman alpha line is in the optical range, we set \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \geq 3000 \, \text{Å} \). Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{emit}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \):

\[
1216 \cdot (1 + z) \geq 3000
\]

\[
1 + z \geq \frac{3000}{1216} \approx 2.466
\]

\[
z \geq 2.466 - 1 \approx 1.466
\]

Thus, the minimum redshift is approximately \( z \geq 1.47 \).

### Step 2: Adjust for stricter optical cutoff
If we consider the optical range to start at 4000 Å (visible light), the calculation becomes:

\[
1216 \cdot (1 + z) \geq 4000
\]

\[
1 + z \geq \frac{4000}{1216} \approx 3.289
\]

\[
z \geq 3.289 - 1 \approx 2.289
\]

Thus, the minimum redshift is approximately \( z \geq 2.29 \).

### Step 3: Compare with the options
The options provided are:
- **A) 3**
- **B) 1.2**
- **C) 2.4**
- **D) 1.9**

From the calculations:
- A redshift of \( z = 1.2 \) (option B) results in \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \cdot (1 + 1.2) = 2675 \, \text{Å} \), which is in the UV and not detectable by optical telescopes.
- A redshift of \( z = 1.9 \) (option D) results in \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \cdot (1 + 1.9) = 3526 \, \text{Å} \), which is still in the UV and not detectable.
- A redshift of \( z = 2.4 \) (option C) results in \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \cdot (1 + 2.4) = 4126

---------------

 \, \text{Å} \), which is in the optical range and detectable.
- A redshift of \( z = 3 \) (option A) is also valid but unnecessarily high since \( z = 2.4 \) suffices.

### Conclusion
The lower limit on the redshift is approximately \( z \geq 2.29 \), and the closest option is **C) 2.4**.
