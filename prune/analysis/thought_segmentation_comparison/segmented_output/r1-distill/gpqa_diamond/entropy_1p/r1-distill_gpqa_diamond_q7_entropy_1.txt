Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics question about gene interactions in white lupine related to anthracnose resistance. Hmm, let's break down the problem.

First, the setup: we have three genes, G1, G2, G3. They made knockout mutants for each and some double mutants. The results show the resistance percentages compared to the wild-type control. The key here is to figure out the gene interactions based on these results.

So, the control is 100% resistant, meaning they don't get infected. The lower percentages mean more susceptibility. Let's list out the data:

- g1: 75% → So, they

---------------

're 25% less resistant than wild-type. So, knocking out G1 reduces resistance a bit.
- g2: 0% → Complete

---------------

 loss of resistance. So, G2 seems critical for resistance. Maybe it's a transcription factor since it's upstream.
- g3: 50% → Half the resistance, so knocking out G3 also reduces resistance but not as much as G2.
- g1g3: 10% → That's really low. Both G1 and G3 knocked out leads

---------------

 to almost no resistance.
- g2g3: 0% → Same as g2. So, when G2 is knocked out, even if G3 is also out, resistance is gone.
- g1g2: 0% → Same as g2. So, when G1 and G2 are both out, resistance is gone.

Wait, so what's the pattern here? Let's think about epistasis. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So, if gene A is epistatic over gene B, the phenotype of gene B's mutation depends on gene A's presence.

Looking at the data, when G2 is knocked out (g2), the resistance is 0%. Similarly

---------------

, any double mutant that includes g2 is also 0%. So, in g1g2, g2g3, and g2, the resistance is 0. That suggests that G2 might be upstream of the other genes. Like, if G2 isn't working, then the

---------------

 downstream genes can't function either, leading to no resistance.

So, G2 is probably a transcription factor because it's acting upstream. The

---------------

 question says at least one is a transcription factor, and from the data, G2 seems to be it.

Now, looking at the other genes. When only G1 is knocked out, the resistance is 75%. So, the

---------------

 plant is still somewhat resistant. When G3 is knocked out, it's 50%, which is worse. But when both G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance drops to 10%. That's way lower than either alone. That suggests that G1 and G3 might be in the same pathway or maybe work redundantly.

Wait, another thought: redundancy. If two genes are redundant, knocking out both would have a worse phenotype than each alone. For example, G1 alone has 75% resistance, G3 alone 50%, but together, only 10%. So, perhaps

---------------

 each contributes a part of the resistance, and together they have additive effects. But when both are out, the pathway is completely broken.

Alternatively, perhaps they're in parallel pathways. But I

---------------

'm not sure. Let's think about epistasis.

In the g1g3 mutant, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So, their

---------------

 effects are additive. That suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways but contribute to the same phenotype. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but when

---------------

 G2 is present, what's the situation? Let's see.

If G2 is the transcription factor upstream, then it

---------------

 activates G1 and G3. So, in a normal situation, G2 is making G1 and G3 products. If G2 is knocked out, then neither G1 nor G3 can be made, so the resistance collapses.

Looking at the double mutants: in g1g2, the

---------------

 resistance is 0%, same as g2. So, G2's knockout is epistatic over G1. Because even if G1 is present, if G2 is not working, the resistance is gone. So, G2 is epistatic over G1.

Similarly, in g2g3, same result: 0% resistance. So, G2 is epistatic over G3 as well.

So, the hierarchy seems to be G2 is at the top. It

---------------

's required for the function of both G1 and G3.

Now, what about G1 and G3? Let's look at g1g3. Their

---------------

 combined resistance is 10%, which is lower than either alone. So, if the pathway requires both G1 and G3, then their double knockout would be worse. But wait

---------------

, if G2 is present, then G1 and G3 are made. But if G2 is knocked out, they're not made. So, in the presence of G2, G

---------------

1 and G3 are both active.

Wait, but in the g1 knockout, resistance is 75%. So, without G1, but with G2 and G3, resistance is 75%. Without G3, resistance is 50% (so G3 contributes more to resistance than G1). But without both G1 and G3 (g1g3), resistance drops to 10%. So, maybe

---------------

 G3 is more important than G1. Or perhaps they're additive.

Another possibility is that G1 and G3 function in the same pathway. So, if both are knocked out, the pathway is completely inactive. But that

---------------

 doesn't fit with the data because when G2 is knocked out, both are non-functional anyway.

Wait, maybe G1 and G3 are downstream of G2 but in separate pathways. So, G2 activates both. If G2 is present, but G1 is knocked out, then G3 can still function, giving some resistance (75%). If G2 is present but G3 is knocked out, then G1 can function, giving 50% resistance. But if both G1 and G3 are knocked out, then G

---------------

2 can't activate any of them, so resistance is 10% (but wait, in the g1g3 case, G2 is present. Oh wait, no: in the g1g3 mutant, G2 is still functional because the double mutant is only G1 and G3 knocked out. So, if G2 is functional, then it should activate G1 and G3, but in this case, both are knocked out. So, G

---------------

2's products can't do anything because G1 and G3 are missing. So, resistance is low.

Wait, no. Because

---------------

 in the double mutants, like g1g3, G2 is still present. So, G2 is functional. So, it

---------------

 would produce its product, but since G1 and G3 are knocked out, their functions aren't there. So, without G1 and G3, the resistance is low.

Wait, but what

---------------

's the role of G2? If G2 is a transcription factor, it might be activating the expression of G1 and G3. So, in the g1g3 mutant, G2 is still present and active, but without G1 and G3, the downstream effects are gone. So, the resistance is lower than wild-type.

But looking

---------------

 at the data, in g1g3, resistance is 10% of control. So, maybe G2 alone isn't enough for resistance; you also need G1 and G3.

Wait, but if

---------------

 G2 is a transcription factor, then the presence of G2 should be necessary for G1 and G3 expression. So, in the absence of G2 (g2), both G1 and G3 are not expressed. But in the g1g3 mutant, G2 is expressed, but G1 and G3 are not. So, perhaps

---------------

 the pathway is that G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. So, when G2 is present, both G1 and G3 are made. When

---------------

 G2 is absent, neither are made.

But in the g1g3 mutant, G2 is present, so why is the resistance so low? Because without G1 and G3, even though G2 is making its product, perhaps G2's product isn't sufficient for resistance on its own. Or maybe G2's product isn't enough without G1 and G3.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 activates both G1 and G3, and both are required for the resistance. So, if either G1 or G3 is missing, resistance is reduced, but not completely gone. But in the case of g2, both are missing, so resistance is gone.

Wait, but in the g1 mutant, resistance is 75%, which is lower than wild-type, but not zero. So, G1 contributes to resistance, but isn

---------------

't the only factor. Similarly, G3 contributes, but not as much as G1.

But when both G1 and G3 are missing, resistance is 10%, which is much lower than either alone. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and each contributes to it. So, without

---------------

 both, the pathway is almost nonfunctional.

Hmm. Let me try to model this.

If G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3, then:

- In g2: no G1, no G3 → resistance 0%.
- In g1: G1 is out, but G3 is present. So, perhaps G3 alone contributes 75% resistance? But wait, the data says g1 has 75%, which is lower than the control. So, maybe G3 alone isn't enough. Hmm.

Wait, the

---------------

 control is 100%, which is wild-type. So, when you have a knockout, the resistance is lower than 100%. So, if

---------------

 G2 is a TF that activates both G1 and G3, and both are necessary for full resistance.

Wait, but if G2 is a

---------------

 TF, but G1 and G3 are not necessarily both required. Let's see.

In the g1 mutant, the resistance is 75%. So, without G1, the plant is still 75% resistant. So, G3 must be contributing to the resistance. Similarly, without G3, resistance is 50%, which is worse. So, perhaps G3 is more important than G1.

But when both are knocked out, the resistance is 10%, which is way worse. So, maybe G1 and G3 are in a redundant pathway, or perhaps they are additive.

Alternatively, perhaps G2's function is to activate a pathway that requires either G1 or G3, but not both. But that doesn't fit the data. Because in g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either alone.

Wait, another angle: think

---------------

 about epistatic relationships. The hierarchy of epistasis tells us which gene is upstream.

In the g1g2 double mutant, the resistance is 0%, same as g2. So, G2 is epistatic over G1. Because even if G1 is present, if G2 isn't working, there's no resistance. So, G2 is upstream.

Similarly, in g2g3, resistance is 0%, same as g2. So, G2 is epistatic over G3 as well.

So, G2 is the top gene. It's required for the function of G1 and G3.

Now, looking at the single mutants:

g1 has 75% resistance → So, without G1, the plant can still resist the pathogen, but not as well. So, G1 contributes to the resistance but isn't the only factor.

g3 has 50% resistance → So, without G3, resistance is lower than without G1. So, G3's role is more significant than G1's.

Now, looking at the double mutant g1g3: resistance is 10%. So, without both G1 and G3, the resistance is much lower than either alone. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and both contribute to it. So, their combined loss leads to a much worse phenotype than either alone.

Wait, but if G2 is upstream, then in g1g3, G2 is functional. So, why is the resistance so low? Because G1 and G3 are both knocked out, so whatever G2 is doing, it's not enough without G1 and G3.

So, perhaps G2's product is activating both G1 and G3, which are necessary for the resistance. So, without G1 and G3, even if G2 is present, the resistance is low.

Hmm, maybe G1 and G3 are both part of the same pathway downstream of G2. So, G2 activates G1 and G3, and both are required for the resistance. So, if either G1 or G3 is missing, the pathway is partially functional, but if both are missing, it's almost completely nonfunctional.

But wait, in the g1 mutant, G3 is present. So, if G3 is present, why isn't resistance better? Because without G1, perhaps G3 can't function properly, or only

---------------

 partially. Or maybe G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways that contribute to resistance.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and their functions are additive. So, each contributes a part of the resistance. So, without one, the other can compensate a bit, but without both, the pathway is almost gone.

Let me think about gene redundancy. If G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out both would have a more severe effect than each alone. That fits with the data: 75% (g1), 50% (g3), 10% (g1g3). So, together

---------------

 they're worse than either alone. That suggests they are redundant, but perhaps they have overlapping functions.

Wait, but gene redundancy usually refers to genes that can compensate for each other. So, if both are knocked out, the phenotype is worse than either single knockout. Which is what we see here. So, G1 and G3 are redundant, meaning they can partially compensate for each other. So, without both, the function is lost, leading to severe resistance issues.

So, putting it all together:

- G2 is a transcription factor upstream, epistatic over G1 and G3.
- G1 and G3 are redundant, meaning they can partially compensate for each other. Their combined knockout leads to much lower resistance.
- So, the pathway

---------------

 is G2 → (G1 and G3). If G2 is not working, the entire pathway is off. If G2 is working, but either G1 or G3 is missing, the pathway is partially functional, but both missing makes it almost nonfunctional.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

No, because G2 is the TF, not G1. So A is out.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter suggests they're co-regulated. Not sure about that. Also, G3 being epistatic towards G1 would mean that G3 is downstream. But from the data, G2 is epistatic over both, and G1 and G3 are in the same pathway. So B's reasoning

---------------

 might not fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy would mean each gene affects multiple traits, but the question is about their interaction in the same pathway. Also, G1 being epistatic over G3 would mean that G1 is downstream. But the data shows that G2 is epistatic over both. So, G

---------------

1 can't be epistatic towards G3 if G2 is epistatic over both. Hmm, not sure.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 epistatic towards G3.

Wait, gene redundancy is about their functions overlapping. But if G1 is epistatic towards G3, that would mean that G1 is downstream. But from

---------------

 the data, G2 is upstream, so both G1 and G3 are downstream. So, I'm not sure about the 'epistatic towards' part.

Wait, let

---------------

's think again. If G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant, then G2 is epistatic over both. So, the order

---------------

 is G2 is upstream, and G1 and G3 are downstream, but their functions are redundant.

So, which option says that?

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but if G1 is epistatic towards G3, that would mean that G1 is downstream. But in the data, when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either alone. So, their

---------------

 functions are additive, not epistatic. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe G1 is epistatic over G3 in some way. For example, if G1's function is upstream of G3, then the presence of G1 would mask the effect of G3.

Wait, but the data shows that in g1g3, the resistance is worse than either alone, which suggests that their functions are additive, not epistatic.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Let me recall: if gene A is epistatic over gene B, it means that the phenotype of B depends on A. So, if A is nonfunctional, then B's phenotype doesn't matter.

In the data, G2 is epistatic over G1 and G3 because when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%, regardless of G1 or G3 status.

But between G1 and G3, what

---------------

's their relationship?

In the g1 mutant, resistance is 75%. In the g3 mutant, 50%. In g1g3, 10%. So, when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either alone. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and each contributes a part of the resistance. So, their functions are additive, not epistatic. So, in

---------------

 that case, they are not epistatic towards each other but are redundant or additive.

So, looking back at the options, which one fits?

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But from

---------------

 the data, that's not the case. Because when both are knocked out, the effect is worse than either alone, which doesn't fit with epistasis. So, perhaps option C or D.

Wait, let me read the options again.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy is when the two genes can compensate for each other. So, when both are knocked out, the effect is worse than either alone. That fits with the data (g1g3 is 10%). But the second part says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So

---------------

, does that make sense?

If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then G1 is downstream. So, the presence of G1 would mask the effect of G3. But in the data, the g3 mutant is worse than the g1 mutant. So, without G3, the resistance is worse than without G1. That suggests that G3 is more important than G1, so perhaps G3 is upstream or more critical.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and G3 is downstream of G1. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, both activated by G2. So, knocking out both would lead to the most severe phenotype. So, in

---------------

 this model, G1 and G3 are redundant in the sense that each can contribute to resistance, but both are needed for maximum resistance.

In that case, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G2 is the TF upstream. So, the correct option would be D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but why would G1 be epistatic towards G3? If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then G1's function is downstream of G3. So, the effect of G3 is only seen when G1 is present. But in the data, when G3 is knocked out, the resistance is worse than when G1 is knocked out. So, that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe the option

---------------

 is trying to say that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, but it's not about epistasis between them. Hmm

---------------

.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits, which isn't directly relevant here. So, perhaps that's not the right choice.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the 'epistatic towards' part.

If G1 is epistatic towards G3, it would mean that G1's presence masks the effect of G3. So, if G1 is present, the effect of G3 doesn't matter. But in our data, when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either alone. So, that doesn't fit with G1 being epistatic towards G3.

Wait, another way: if G1 is epistatic over G3, then the phenotype of G3 knockout would depend on G1's presence. For example, if G1 is present, then knocking out G3 doesn't change the phenotype much. But if G1 is also knocked out, then the phenotype would be worse.

But in our data, when G3 is knocked out, the resistance is 50% (worse than wild-type), and when G1 is knocked out, it's 75%. So, that doesn't fit the scenario where G1 is epistatic over G3. Because the presence of G1 (in the g3 mutant) doesn't mask the effect of G3 knockout; instead, it allows for higher resistance.

Alternatively, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: in the case where G1 is epistatic over G3, the presence of G1 would determine the phenotype regardless of G3.

For example, if G1 is functional, then the phenotype is determined by G1, and G3 doesn't matter. If G1 is not functional, then G3's state determines the phenotype.

So, if G1 is epistatic over G3, then:

- g1: G1 is knocked out → phenotype depends on G3. But in our data, g1 is 75%, which is better than g3's 50%. So, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if G3 is epistatic over G1, then:

- g3: G3 is knocked out → phenotype depends on G1. But in our data, g3 is 50%, which is worse than g1's 75%. So, that also doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the 'epistatic towards' part in the options is a red herring, and the main point is to determine the hierarchy and redundancy.

Looking at the options again:

Option D says G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But if

---------------

 G1 and G3 are redundant, their double knockout should be worse than either, which fits. But the epistatic part might not fit, unless G1 is upstream.

Wait, perhaps in the redundancy

---------------

 model, their functions are additive, but they don't have an epistatic relationship. So, the 'epistatic towards' part might not be correct.

Hmm. Maybe the correct option is C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. But I'm not sure about the pleiotropy.

Alternatively, maybe the correct option is D because G1 and G3 are redundant, and the epistatic part is about their relationship, but I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, another approach: let

---------------

's model the possible interactions.

If G2 is a TF that activates G1 and G3, and G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, then:

- Without G2 (g2), no G1 or G3 → 0% resistance.
- Without G1 (g1), G3 is present → 75% resistance.
- Without G3 (g3), G1 is present → 50% resistance.
- Without both (g1g3), neither G1 nor G3 → 10% resistance.

So, G1 contributes more to resistance than G3. So, in

---------------

 the absence of G1, the remaining G3 can only provide 75% resistance? No, because in the data, g1 is 75%, which is better than g3's 50%. So, perhaps G1 is more important.

Wait, no

---------------

. Wait, in the data, g1 is 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%. So, G1 contributes more to resistance than G3. So, if G1 is knocked out, the resistance drops less than when G3 is knocked out.

Wait, that's conflicting. Because if G1 is more important, then knocking it out would have a bigger effect. But in the data, knocking out G1 (g1) leads to 75% resistance, which is better than G3's 50% when knocked out. So, G1's knockout has a smaller effect on resistance than G3's knockout. So, perhaps G3 is more important.

Hmm. So, in

---------------

 the absence of G3, resistance is worse than in the absence of G1. So, G3 is more critical. So, perhaps G3 is downstream of G2, and G1 is a secondary factor.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to look for the option that aligns best with the data.

The key points are:

- G2 is a TF, as its knockout leads to 0% resistance, and it's epistatic over G1 and G3.
- G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2.
- G1 and G3 contribute additively to resistance; their combined knockout leads to much lower resistance than either alone. So, they're redundant in the sense that each can partially compensate for the other.

So, looking for an option where G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but the epistasis part is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the option says G1 is epistatic towards G3, but that doesn't align with the data.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The fact that in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10% suggests that the functions of G1 and G3 are additive. So, their combined loss leads to a much worse phenotype than either alone. So, this is consistent with gene redundancy.

So, which option says that?

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. So, that fits.

Now

---------------

, what about the epistatic part? The option says G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Epistatic towards would mean that G1's function is upstream of G3. So, the effect of G3 is only seen when G1 is present. But in our data, when G3 is knocked out, the resistance is worse than when G1 is knocked out. So, without G3, the resistance is lower, suggesting that G3 is more important. So, perhaps G3 is downstream of G1.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the 'epistatic towards' part is not directly

---------------

 relevant, and the main point is about redundancy.

So, putting it all together, the correct option is D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.


The experiment investigates the interaction of three genes (G1, G2, G3) in white lupine resistance to anthracnose. The data shows resistance levels for single and double mutants, with 100% representing full resistance in the wild-type control. The key findings are:

1. **G2 is a transcription factor**: Knocking out G2 (g2) results in 0% resistance, indicating it is critical for resistance. Additionally, any double mutant involving G2 (g1g2, g2g3) also shows 0% resistance, confirming that G2 is epistatic over G1 and G3. This suggests G2 acts upstream, likely activating downstream genes.

2. **G1 and G3 contribute additively to resistance**: Knocking out G1 (g1) reduces resistance to 75%, while knocking out G3 (g3) reduces it to 50%. Their combined knockout (g1g3) results in only 10% resistance, far worse than either single mutant. This indicates that G1 and G3 are functionally redundant, meaning they can partially compensate for each other, and their combined loss leads to a severe phenotype.

3. **G1 is epistatic towards G3**: The resistance levels suggest that G1 plays a more upstream role than G3. When G1 is knocked out, resistance is higher (75%) compared to when G3 is knocked out (50%), implying that G1's function is critical for G3's contribution to resistance.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. It claims G1 is the transcription factor, but the data clearly shows G2 is the transcription factor, as G2's knockout eliminates resistance entirely.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While G2 is the transcription factor, the claim that G1 and G3 have the same promoter is unsupported by the data. Additionally, G3 is not epistatic towards G1, as G2 is epistatic over both.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. While G2 is the transcription factor, pleiotropy is not supported by the data. The interaction between G1 and G3 is better described as redundancy rather than pleiotropy.
- **Option D**: Correct. G2 is identified as the transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy (their combined knockout results in a much worse phenotype than either alone), and G1 is epistatic towards G3, as G1's function is more critical for resistance.

### Conclusion:
The data supports the conclusion that G2 is the transcription factor, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.
