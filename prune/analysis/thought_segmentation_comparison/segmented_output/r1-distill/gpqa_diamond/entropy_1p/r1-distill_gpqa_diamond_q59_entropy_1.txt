Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details right.

So, there's an intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They've built a super fast spacecraft that can travel at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The aliens have an average lifetime of about 150 solar years. Now, they want to come to Earth, and the question is about how long their 22-year-old astronaut will experience the trip taking, from their own perspective.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, special relativity comes into play. Specifically, time dilation and length contraction effects. So I think this problem is about calculating the proper time experienced by the astronaut.

Wait, the question says "from the point of view of the astronaut." So I should be using the astronaut's proper time, which is the time experienced in their own frame of reference. That would involve the Lorentz factor and time dilation.

But wait, to

---------------

 calculate proper time, I need to know the distance between the starting point (Large Magellanic Cloud) and Earth, right? Oh, but wait, the problem doesn't give me the distance. Hmm, maybe I can find the distance based on the speed of the spacecraft and the time as observed from Earth?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The problem gives the speed as a fraction of c, but it doesn't mention any distance. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Oh wait, maybe the distance is the same as the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud from Earth. I think the LMC is about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. Is

---------------

 that correct? Let me confirm. Yeah, I remember it's roughly around 160,000 light-years. So the distance D is approximately 160,000 light-years.

Wait, but the problem states that the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987c. So from Earth's perspective, the time taken would be D divided by speed. So time t_earth = D / v.

But wait, the astronaut's experienced time is different due to time dilation. The proper time τ is given by τ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Or wait, no

---------------

, the proper time is the time measured in the moving frame (the spacecraft), so I think τ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the formula for time dilation is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t' is the dilated time (in

---------------

 the spaceship's frame) and t is the time in the Earth's frame. So if the trip takes t years according to Earth, the astronaut's clock will show τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but wait, the

---------------

 speed is 0.99999987c, which is extremely close to the speed of light. So v ≈ c. Let me calculate v²/c².

v = 0.99999987c, so v/c = 0.99999987. Squaring that, (0.99999987)^2 = approximately 0.99999974. So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 0.00000026. The square root of that would be sqrt(2.6e-7). Let me calculate that.

Hmm, sqrt(2.6e-7) is approximately sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5. Wait, sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612, and 1e-3.5 is 3.16e-4. So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4. So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 5.09e-4.

So the Lorentz factor gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 1/(5.09e-4) ≈ 1968. So gamma is about 1968.

Now, the time according to Earth t_earth is D / v. D is 160,000 light-years, and v is 0.99999987c. So t_earth = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987c) ≈ (160,000 / 0.99999987) years. Let me compute that. 160,000 divided by almost 1 is about 160,000 years. Wait, but wait, 0.99999987 is almost 1, so 160,000 / 0.99999987 is approximately 160,000 * (1 + 1.23e-6) ≈ 160,000 + 160,000 * 1.23e-6. Let's compute that. 160,000 * 1e-6 is 0.16, so 1.23e-6 would be about 0.1968. So t_earth ≈ 160,000 + 0.1968 ≈ 160,000.1968 years. Approximately 160,000 years.

Wait, but that seems too long. Wait

---------------

, wait, no, the distance is 160,000 light-years, and the speed is 0.99999987c. So the time from Earth's frame is (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987c) = (160,000 / 0.99999987) years. Let me compute that division

---------------

 more accurately.

So 160,000 divided by 0.99999987 is the same as 160,000 * (1 / 0.99999987). Since 1/0.99999987 is approximately 1.00000013 (because 1/(1 - x) ≈ 1 + x for small x). So 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 160,000 + (160,000 * 1.3e-6). Let me calculate 160,000 * 1.3e-6: 160,000 * 1.3e-6 = (160,000) * 0.0000013 = 0.208. So t_earth ≈ 160,000.208 years. So about 160,000 years, which

---------------

 is way longer than the astronaut's lifespan.

Wait, but that's from Earth's perspective. The astronaut's time is τ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 160,000 * 5.09e-4 ≈ 81.44 years.

Wait, because τ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So 160,000 * 5.09e-4 is approximately 81.44 years.

But wait, the astronaut is 22 years old. So adding 81 years would make them 103 years old. But the alien's average lifetime is 150 years. So they would live long enough to reach Earth. So the time experienced is about 81 years.

Looking at the options, option C is 81 years. So the answer would be C.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations. Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps I should consider using the relativistic velocity and compute the distance in the astronaut's frame using length contraction.

Wait, length contraction formula is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where L0 is the proper length (Earth's frame), and L is the length in the spaceship's frame. So the distance the astronaut travels would be L = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 160,000 * 5.09e-4 ≈ 81.44 light-years.

Then, the time experienced by the astronaut is τ = L / v. Because in their frame, they're stationary, and the Earth is approaching at speed v. So τ = (81.44 ly) / (0.99999987c) ≈ 81.44 / 0.99999987 ≈ 81.44 years. So that's consistent with the earlier result.

So the astronaut would experience about 81 years of travel time. Since they're 22, they would be 103 when they arrive, which is well within their 150-year lifespan. So the answer is option C, 81 years.


To determine how long the astronaut will experience the trip taking, we use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and length contraction. The spacecraft travels at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), and the distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately \( D = 160,000 \) light-years.

### Step 1: Time from Earth's perspective
From Earth's frame, the time taken for the trip is given by:
\[
t_{\text{earth}} = \frac{D}{v} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987c} \approx 160,000 \, \text{years}.
\]

### Step 2: Proper time experienced by the astronaut
The proper time \( \tau \) experienced by the astronaut is related to \( t_{\text{earth}} \) by the time dilation formula:
\[
\tau = t_{\text{earth}} \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}.
\]
First, calculate \( \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \):
\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974, \quad \text{so } 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \approx 0.00000026.
\]
\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \approx \sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 5.09 \times 10^{-4}.
\]
Substitute \( t_{\text{earth}} \) and \( \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \) into the formula for \( \tau \):
\[
\tau = 160,000 \times 5.09 \times 10^{-4} \approx 81.44 \, \text{years}.
\]

### Step 3: Verification using length contraction
In the astronaut's frame, the distance to Earth is contracted:
\[
L = D \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \approx 160,000 \times 5.09 \times 10^{-4} \approx 81.44 \, \text{light-years}.
\]
The time experienced by the astronaut is then:
\[
\tau = \frac{L}{v} \approx \frac{81.44 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987c} \approx 81.44 \, \text{years}.
\]

### Step 4: Conclusion
The astronaut will experience approximately 81 years of travel time. Since they are 22 years old, they will be 103 years old upon arrival, which is within their average lifespan of 150 years. Therefore, the correct answer is:
