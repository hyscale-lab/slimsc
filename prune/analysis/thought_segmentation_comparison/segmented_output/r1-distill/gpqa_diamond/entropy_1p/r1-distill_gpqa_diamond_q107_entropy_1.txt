Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. The setup is a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, and they mention that m (the orbital magnetic quantum number) has small values. The magnetic field strength is 1 Tesla, and the transition energy corresponds to a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers.

Hmm, I remember that the paramagnetic coupling term is related to the Zeeman effect. The Zeeman effect involves the splitting of atomic energy levels in a magnetic field. The paramagnetic term would be the contribution from the electron's orbital motion, while diamagnetic is from its spin. But wait, the problem specifies paramagnetic coupling, so that's the orbital part.

The transition energy ΔE is given by the wavelength λ. I can calculate ΔE using the energy of a photon formula: E = hc/λ. Since λ is 0.4861 micrometers, that's 486.1 nanometers, which I think is in the visible range, maybe the Balmer series of hydrogen. So

---------------

 ΔE would be the energy difference between two energy levels in the hydrogen atom.

Wait, but the paramagnetic term is the Zeeman splitting. So the Zeeman energy shift is given by ΔE_zeeman = μ_B * B * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m is the magnetic quantum number. Oh wait, but wait

---------------

, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The Zeeman effect for orbital motion is given by ΔE = (e^2 * B * m) / (8π m_e c), which is the same as μ_B * m * B. Alternatively

---------------

, I've seen it expressed as (μ_B * m) * B.

Wait, the Bohr magneton μ_B is (eħ)/(2 m_e), and the orbital contribution is given

---------------

 by that. So the paramagnetic term is proportional to B and m.

The problem states that m is small, which probably means m is near

---------------

 zero or a small integer. But wait, in hydrogen, the possible m values are from -l to +l. For example, in the p orbital (l=1), m can be -1, 0, +1. So if m is small, maybe m is zero, but that

---------------

 would make the term zero. Alternatively, maybe m is ±1, but small in magnitude.

But in any case, the question is comparing the paramagnetic coupling term (which I'll call H_p) with the transition energy ΔE.

So first, I need to compute both values.

Let me compute ΔE first. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 μm, which is 486.1e-9 meters. So using E = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. c is speed of light, about 3e8 m/s.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9) 

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 486.1e-9 m: 1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 = Let's compute that.

486.1e-9 is 4.861e-7 m. So 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = approximately (1.9878 / 4.861) * 1e-18.

1.9878 / 4.861 ≈ 0.41, so E ≈ 0.41e-18 J. That's 4.1e-19 J.

But wait, I

---------------

 should check the exact value. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, another approach: 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So I can compute E in eV.

E = (12400 eV·nm) / λ in nm.

λ is 486.1 nm.

So E = 12400 / 486.1 ≈ 25.5 eV. Wait, that can't be right. Wait no, 486 nm is about 2.5 eV? Wait, no, wait: 12400 eV·nm is the product hc in eV·nm. So E (eV) = 12400 / λ(nm).

So 12400 / 486.1 ≈ let's compute that.

486.1 is approximately 486, so 12400 / 486 ≈ 25.52 eV? Wait, that can't be right. Because the visible spectrum is about 1.5 to 3 eV. Wait, I

---------------

'm confused.

Wait, no, 486 nm is in the visible range, which is about 2.5 eV. Wait, let

---------------

 me compute it accurately.

12400 / 486.1 = let's compute 12400 ÷ 486.1.

Well, 486 * 25 is 12150. 12400-12150=250. So 25 + 250/486.1 ≈ 25 + 0.514 ≈ 25.514 eV. Hmm, that's about 25.5 eV. But wait, that's way higher than typical hydrogen transition energies. Wait, no

---------------

, because the Balmer series transition is from n=2 to n=3 or something? Wait, the Balmer-alpha line is about 486 nm, which is the transition from n=4 to n=2. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So the transition from n=4 to n=2 would be E4 - E2 = (-13.6 / 16) - (-13.6 /4 ) = (-0.85) + 3.4 = 2.55 eV. So why am I getting 25 eV when I calculate with the wavelength?

Ah! Oh wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check. 

---------------

486 nm is 486e-9 meters. So E = hc/λ.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
λ = 486e-9 m

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486e-9) = (1.9878e-25) / (486e-9) = 1.9878e-25 / 4.86e-7 = approximately 4.1e-19 J.

Wait, but converting J to eV: 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 4.1e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.56 eV. Oh, okay, that makes sense. So ΔE is about 2.56 eV.

Wait, but that's the energy of the photon, which is the transition energy. So ΔE is about 2.56 eV.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term is the Zeeman energy shift. The formula is ΔE_zeeman = μ_B * B * m, where m is the magnetic quantum number. But wait, I

---------------

'm not sure about the exact expression. Alternatively, it's given by the expectation value of the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field. The paramagnetic term (orbital contribution) is H_p = (e^2 B)/(8π m_e c) * L · B, but since B is along Oz, it becomes proportional to m. So H_p = μ_B * B * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

Wait, μ_B is (eħ)/(2 m_e), and for orbital angular momentum, the expectation value is μ_B * m * B. So the energy shift is ΔE_p = μ_B * B * m.

But wait, what's the value of μ_B? Let me recall. μ_B ≈ 9.274e-24 J/T.

So B

---------------

 is 1 T. So ΔE_p = 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T * m.

But what's m? The problem says m is small. Let's think about possible m values in hydrogen. For example, in the ground state, l=0, so m=0. For l=1 (p orbital), m can be -1, 0, +1. For l=2 (d orbital), m can be -2, -1, 0, +1, +2. But since the problem says small m, perhaps m is 0 or ±1.

Wait, but the problem is about the hydrogen atom. Let's think about which transition this

---------------

 wavelength corresponds to. The wavelength λ=0.4861 μm is the Balmer-alpha line, which is the transition from n=4 to n=2, so the energy difference is about 2.55 eV, as we calculated earlier.

In that transition, the possible

---------------

 m values would depend on the angular momentum change. For hydrogen, the transition from n=4 to n=2 can involve l values changing from, say, l=2 to l=1, or other possibilities. Let's say for the transition, the m values could be such

---------------

 that the change in m is zero, but perhaps that's not directly relevant here.

But the question is about the paramagnetic term for

---------------

 a given state. So for each state, the paramagnetic term would be ΔE_p = μ_B * B * m. But since

---------------

 m can be small, like m=0 or ±1, we can compute that.

Wait, but if m is 0, then ΔE_p is zero. But the question says m is small, not necessarily zero. So perhaps m is ±1. Let's proceed with m=1.

So ΔE_p = μ_B * B * m = (9.274e-24 J/T) * 1 T * 1 = 9.274e-24 J.

But wait, what

---------------

 about the actual value of m in the state? Because for a given state, m can be from -l to +l. But the

---------------

 problem doesn't specify the state, just that m is small. So perhaps we can assume m=1.

So let's compute ΔE_p in eV. 9.274e-24 J is equal to 9.274e-24 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 5.79e-5 eV. So about 5.8e-5 eV.

Wait, and the transition energy ΔE is about 2.56 eV. So comparing 5.8e-5 eV to 2.56 eV, the paramagnetic term is much smaller. So the paramagnetic term is much less than the transition energy.

But wait, the question is about the order of magnitude. So which is bigger, the paramagnetic term or the transition energy? Since

---------------

 the paramagnetic term is about 1e-4 eV, and the transition is 2.56 eV, the paramagnetic term is much smaller.

So the paramagnetic term H_p is much less than ΔE.

Wait, but wait. What's the question exactly? It says to compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy ΔE.

So if H_p is the paramagnetic term, which is much smaller than ΔE, then ⟨H⟩ (the expectation value of the paramagnetic term) is much less than ΔE. So the answer would be C) ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE.

Wait, but the question says "compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with transition energy ΔE". So the

---------------

 paramagnetic term is H_p, and it's much smaller than ΔE.

So the correct option would be C) ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE.


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters:

1. **Transition Energy (\( \Delta E \))**:  
   The transition energy corresponds to a wavelength \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} \). Using the formula \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we calculate:  
   \[
   E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{486.1 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 4.1 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):  
   \[
   \Delta E \approx \frac{4.1 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.56 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term (\( \langle H \rangle \))**:  
   The paramagnetic term arises from the Zeeman effect and is given by \( \langle H \rangle = \mu_B \cdot B \cdot m \), where \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton, \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \), and \( m \) is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Since \( m \) is small (e.g., \( m = 1 \)), we calculate:  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle = (9.274 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \approx 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Converting to electron volts:  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle \approx \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

3. **Comparison**:  
   The transition energy \( \Delta E \approx 2.56 \, \text{eV} \) is significantly larger than the paramagnetic coupling term \( \langle H \rangle \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \). Thus, the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy.

The correct option is:  
**C) \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \).**
