Okay, so I have this question about a diatomic molecule's quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The given data includes the masses of the atoms, the bond length, and the angular frequency of vibration.

Wait, so the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, the non-rigid rotor is an extension of the rigid rotor model where the bond length isn't fixed. But I think in this question, since we're given the bond length, maybe it's treated as rigid for the rotation part, but considering the vibration as well. Hmm.

The fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. But wait, the question is about absorbing a photon that causes the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I guess the photon provides the energy to move to the next energy level.

Wait, what's the next state after the fundamental? The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next state would either be a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). But which one requires less energy? Because the question is about the lowest possible energy,

---------------

 so we need the photon with the least energy possible to cause a transition.

Wait, no, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, I think I might have it the other way around. The next state after the fundamental state would be either the next vibrational state (v=1, J=0) or the next rotational state (v=0, J=1). Which transition requires less energy? Because the photon's energy has to match the energy difference.

I remember that for diatomic molecules, the vibrational energy levels are quantized as (n + ½) ħω, where ω is the angular frequency. The rotational energy is quantized as (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

So the energy difference for vibration from v=0 to v=1 is ħω. The rotational energy difference from J=0 to J=1 is (2 ħ²)/(2I) = ħ²/(I). Wait, let's compute that.

The moment of inertia I is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass. So μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20*2)/(22) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But wait, I should convert that to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg. Let me calculate that: 1.818 * 1.6605 is roughly 3.018

---------------

, so 3.018e-27 kg.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m. So I = μ R² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

Now the rotational energy for J=1 is (2)(1+1) ħ²/(2I) = (2)(2) ħ²/(2I) → Wait, no. The rotational energy is E_rot = (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I). For J=0, it's 0. For J=1, it's (1*2 ħ²)/(2I) )= (2 ħ²)/(2I) = ħ²/I.

So the rotational energy difference is E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = ħ²/I.

The

---------------

 vibrational energy difference is E_vib = ħ ω.

Which of these is smaller? Let's compute both.

First, let's compute E_rot. ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So ħ² is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

So E_rot = ħ² / I. I is 1.207e-46 kg m².

So E_rot = (1.112e-68) / (1.207e-46) ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

Now the vibrational energy E_vib = ħ ω. ω is 4e14 rad/s.

So E_vib = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) * (4e14 1/s) = 4.218e-20 J.

Comparing E_rot (~9.2e-23 J) and E_vib (~4.2e-20 J), the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon should be in the rotational transition.

Wait, but wait. The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. So the fundamental state is v=0 and J=0. The next possible state with the lowest energy would be the next state

---------------

 with the lowest energy, which is either J=1 or v=1. Which of these has lower energy? The rotational transition's energy is lower than the vibrational. So the photon would have to match the energy required for the J=1 transition.

Wait, but I

---------------

'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The energy levels are quantized, and each state is a combination of vibrational and rotational. The fundamental state is (v=0, J=0). The next state in energy could be (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). Which one is lower in energy?

From

---------------

 the calculations, E_rot(J=1) is about 9.2e-23 J, and E_vib(v=1) is about 4.2e-20 J. So E_rot is smaller. So the next state with the lowest possible energy is (v=0, J=1). So the photon should have energy equal to the rotational energy difference.

Wait, but wait another thing. The question

---------------

 says, "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the molecule is in the lowest energy state (v=0, J=0). The next state with the lowest possible energy is the one that requires the least energy to reach. So the

---------------

 photon's energy should match the smallest possible energy jump, which is the rotational one. Because 9.2e-23 J is less than 4.2e-20 J. So the photon must have energy E_photon = E_rot = 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, the options are given in momentum, not energy. So we need to find the momentum p of the photon such that its energy E_photon = p c, where c is the speed of light.

Wait, wait

---------------

, no. Photon's energy is E = p c, because for photons, E = pc, since they have zero mass. So if E = p c, then p = E / c.

So p

---------------

 = (9.21e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. Wait, but looking at the options, they are on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28. Hmm, that's way smaller than what I just calculated. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me recheck the calculations. Maybe I messed up the exponents.

Let me compute E_rot again.

E_rot = ħ² / I.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

I = μ R².

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) * amu. Oh wait, 20 amu is 20 * 1.66e-27 kg. Similarly, 2 amu is 2 * 1.66e-27 kg.

Wait, let

---------------

's recalculate μ.

Mx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg.

My = 2 amu = 2 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-27 kg.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (3.321e-26 kg * 3.321e-27 kg) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27) kg.

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator.

Denominator: 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.321e-26 + 0.3321e-26 = 3.653e-26 kg.

Numerator: 3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27 = (3.321)^2 * 1e-53 = approx 11.025 * 1e-53 = 1.1025e-52 kg².

So μ = (1.1025e-52) / (3.653e-26) kg.

Div

---------------

ide 1.1025e-52 by 3.653e-26: that's approximately 3.017e-27 kg.

So I = μ R².

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

R squared is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So I = 3.017e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.207e-46 kg m².

So that part was correct.

Now E_rot = ħ² / I.

ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 J² s².

So E_rot = (1.112e-68) / (1.207e-46) ≈ 9.21e-23 J. That's correct.

Now, the energy of the photon is E_photon = 9.21e-23 J.

But wait, photons have energy E = pc, since their mass is zero. So p = E / c.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.21e-23 J / 3e8 m/s.

Calculating that: 9.21e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

Wait, 1 Ns is 1 kg·m/s. So 1.9e-28 Ns is 1.9e-28 kg m/s.

Wait, my calculation gives 3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is way smaller than any of the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Hmm, what's wrong here. Let me check the steps

---------------

 again.

Wait, perhaps I confused the model. The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which is the non-rigid rotor model. But wait, in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length isn't fixed. But when

---------------

 calculating the moment of inertia, do I use the same approach as the rigid rotor?

Wait, perhaps the question is actually considering the transition from the ground state to the next vibrational state, not the rotational. Because sometimes, in molecules

---------------

, the vibrational transitions are considered in the context of the rigid rotor, but perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: maybe the question is about the fundamental vibrational state, and the next state is the first overtone. But no, the question says it's in the fundamental state, which is the lowest.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that

---------------

 the molecule is in its fundamental state, and the photon is absorbed to cause a transition to the next state, which is the first excited state. But in the rotational

---------------

-vibration model, the states are combinations of v and J. The energy of the state is a combination of vibrational and rotational energies.

But the question is about the transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the lowest energy transition is the one with the smallest energy difference. So that

---------------

 would be the smallest possible ΔE.

Wait, but in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are E_J = [J(J+1)] * ħ²/(2I). For J=0, E_0=0. For J=1, E_1 = 2 * ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(I). For J=2, E_2=6 ħ²/(2I) = 3 ħ²/(I), etc.

The vibrational energy is E_vib = (v + ½) ħω. So the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is ħω.

So which is smaller: ħ²/(I) or ħω?

We

---------------

 have to compute both.

Compute ħ²/(I):

We have I = 1.207e-46 kg m².

So ħ² is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

So ħ² / I = 1.112e-68 / 1.207e-46 ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

And ħω is 1.0545718e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

So the rotational transition is much smaller in energy.

Therefore, the photon's energy should match the rotational transition, which is about 9.21e-23 J.

Then, since E_photon = p c → p = E_photon / c.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.21e-23 J / 3e8 m/s.

Compute that: 9.21e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But the options are in the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 kg·m/s (since 1 Ns = 1 kg·m/s). So 3.07e-31 is way smaller than any option. So I'm making

---------------

 a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the model is different. Maybe it's considering the transition from the ground vibrational state to the first rotational state, but including

---------------

 the vibrational energy. Hmm, no, I think the fundamental state is v=0, J=0.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the R

---------------

aman transition, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I've made a mistake in calculating the moment of inertia.

Wait, perhaps I should re

---------------

compute I.

I = μ R².

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (22) amu. 20*2=40, 22 is denominator. So μ is 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but in

---------------

 kilograms, 1.818 amu is 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Compute that: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 = approx 3.018e-27 kg.

Wait, then

---------------

 R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

So I = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m². That seems correct.

Wait, maybe I made

---------------

 a mistake in E_rot. Let me recalculate E_rot.

E_rot for J=1 is (1*(1+1)) * ħ²/(2I) → 2 * ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/I.

Yes, that's correct.

So E_rot is 9.21e-23 J.

But the photon's energy is E_photon = 9.21e-23 J.

So

---------------

 p = E_photon / c = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Hmm, but none of the options match this. So perhaps the mistake is that I'm considering only the rotational transition. But maybe the question is about the vibrational transition.

Wait, the

---------------

 options are all about 1e-27 or 1e-28. Let's see what happens if I compute p for the vibrational transition.

E_vib = ħω = 1.0545718e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

Then p = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns, which is 1.4e-28 kg m/s. So that matches.

But earlier I thought the rotational transition requires less energy, but according to the calculations, the rotational transition is smaller, but the photon's momentum for that is 3e-31 kg m/s, which isn't an option. So why is the option D matching the vibrational transition?

Ah, perhaps I misunderstood the model. Maybe the question is considering the transition where the photon is absorbed, causing a change in both rotational and vibrational states. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the model assumes

---------------

 that the molecule is treated as a rigid rotor, and the energy levels are purely rotational. But that can't be, because the question says rotation-vibration model.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is only considering the vibrational energy. But that would ignore

---------------

 the rotational.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the fundamental vibration state (v=1), but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate whether the rotational energy is smaller than the vibrational one. Let's recompute.

E_rot(J=1) = ħ²/(I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.207e-46).

Wait, let me compute that:

(1.0545718e-34)^2 = (1.0545718)^2 * 1e-68 = approx 1.112 * 1e-68 = 1.112e-68.

I is 1.207e-46.

So E_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.207e-46 = 9.21e-23 J.

E_vib = 4.218e-20 J.

So E_rot is much smaller than E_vib. So the photon should have E_rot =9.21e-23 J. But that gives p_photon =3.07e-31 kg m/s, which isn't any of the options.

So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the possible mistake.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the next

---------------

 state with the lowest energy, which could be a combination of rotational and vibrational. So the next state after (v=0, J=0) is (v=0, J=1), but perhaps the energy is lower than (v=1, J=0). But according

---------------

 to the numbers, yes, E_rot is smaller.

But the options don't have a value close to 3e-31. So perhaps I made a mistake in the model.

Wait, another approach: maybe the molecule is considered as a rigid rotor, and the energy levels are purely rotational. But that can't be, because the question says rotation-vibration model.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually asking about the energy difference between the ground state and the next possible energy level, which is the first rotational state (J=1) or the first vibrational state (v=1), whichever has the lower energy.

But according to the calculations, the rotational transition has lower energy. So the photon should match that.

But the

---------------

 options don't have that value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I. Let me recheck.

Wait, M

---------------

x = 20 amu, My = 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (22) = 40/22 = 1.818 amu. Correct.

Then

---------------

, R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m. Correct.

I = μ R² = 1.818 amu * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg, so 1.818 amu = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

So I = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m². Correct.

Hmm, maybe I should check

---------------

 E_rot again.

E_rot(J=1) = [ (1)(2) * ħ² ] / (2I) ) = (2 * ħ² )/(2I) ) = ħ²/(I).

Yes, correct. So that's 9.21e-23 J.

But the

---------------

 options don't have that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." So perhaps the molecule is in a state with both

---------------

 vibrational and rotational energy, but I'm not considering that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the fundamental state being (v=0, J=0), but perhaps

---------------

 the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which could include some rotational or vibrational contributions. Wait, no, the fundamental state in the rotation-vibration model is the lowest possible energy, which is v=0 and J=0.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the transition from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, which would require the photon's energy to be E_vib = ħω.

In

---------------

 that case, p = E_vib / c = (4.218e-20 J) / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 1.406e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns, which is 1.4e-28 kg m/s. So that's the answer

---------------

.

But why did I think the rotational transition was lower? Because the rotational energy is lower than the vibrational. But maybe the question is about the next state in terms of the vibrational state, not considering rotation. Or perhaps the model used

---------------

 in the question doesn't account for rotation when considering transitions.

Wait, the question states that the model is the quantum rotation-vibration model, so both are considered. So the next state would be the one with the lowest energy, which is the rotational transition. But since

---------------

 the options don't include that, perhaps the intended answer is the vibrational one.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I should use the vibrational transition, but why?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the energy required for a transition that includes both a vibrational and rotational change, but that seems more complicated.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is about the transition that requires

---------------

 the least energy, but the energy is the sum of the vibrational and rotational changes. No, that wouldn't make sense because the next

---------------

 state would have the smallest possible energy increment.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong formula for the rotational energy. Let me double-check. For the rigid rotor, the rotational energy levels are E_J = [J(J+1)ħ²]/(2I). So for J=0, E_0=0; J=1, E_1= (2 ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/I. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that I'm not considering the vibrational contribution to the moment of inertia. Oh! Because in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length isn't fixed, but perhaps when calculating the moment of inertia, it's considered as a variable. But in the rigid rotor model, R is fixed, so I is fixed. Hmm, but the question says it's the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, non

---------------

-rigid rotor model (also called the "rotating vibration" model) includes the effect of bond vibrations on the rotational energy. So in the non-rigid rotor, the moment of inertia isn't fixed because the bond length changes during vibration.

Wait, but in

---------------

 the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational energy depends on the vibrational state. So the rotational energy levels are not quantized in the same way as the rigid rotor. So

---------------

 perhaps the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational.

This complicates things because the energy levels are not simply E_rot + E_vib. Instead, the rotational energy depends on the vibrational state.

But I'm not exactly sure how to handle that. Maybe the problem simplifies it by considering the molecule

---------------

 as a rigid rotor for the rotational part, but allowing the vibrational part. But perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only

---------------

 considering the vibrational transition, ignoring rotation. But why would that be? The question says it's using the rotation-vibration model.

Hmm, perhaps the answer

---------------

 is option D, 1.4e-28 kg m/s, which corresponds to the vibrational transition. But according to my earlier calculations, the rotational transition has a lower energy, so that would be the correct transition. But since none of the options match that, perhaps the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating E_rot. Let me try another

---------------

 approach. Let me compute the rotational energy for J=1.

E_rot = (ħ²) / (2I) * J(J+1).

Wait, no, E_rot = [J(J+1) ħ²]/(2I).

For J=1, E_rot = (2 ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/I.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the question

---------------

 is considering the molecule as a rigid rotor, but the energy difference for the next state is not just rotational. Maybe it's the combination of a vibrational and rotational change, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the photon to have energy equal to the vibrational energy, which

---------------

 would give option D.

But why would that be the case if the rotational transition requires less energy? Because the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would be the one that requires the least energy, which is the rotational.

But perhaps the options don't include that, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I. Let me recheck I.

μ = (Mx My)/(Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (22) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

1

---------------

.818 amu in kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

R = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the photon's momentum is not E/c, but something

---------------

 else. Because photons have E = pc, so p = E / c. So that part should be correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is not considering the fundamental state as (v=0, J=0), but as (v=0, J=1), but that can't be because the fundamental state is the lowest energy.

Wait, perhaps I should think

---------------

 about the possible answers. The only option that matches the vibrational transition is D (1.4e-28 kg m/s). The others are much

---------------

 larger.

So perhaps despite the rotational transition being lower in energy, the intended answer is D, assuming that the question is only considering the vibrational transition. Or perhaps I made a miscalculation in the rotational energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the next state in terms of higher vibrational state, ignoring rotation. But that would be odd.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement is that

---------------

 the molecule is in the fundamental state, and the photon is absorbed to cause a transition to the next state, which is the first vibrational state (v=1), regardless of rotation. But that's not the lowest energy state.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0) but in the lowest rotational state (J=0), and the next state is either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. The question is which requires less energy, and thus which photon momentum is needed.

But according to the numbers, the rotational transition is much lower. So the correct answer would be the rotational transition, but none of the options match that.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_rot. Let me recompute E_rot.

E_rot = ħ² / I.

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s.

I is 1.207e-46 kg m².

So E_rot = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.207e-46) → (1.112e-68) / (1.207e-46) = 9.21e-23 J.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the question

---------------

 is about the transition from the ground state to the first vibrational state, not considering rotation. But why would that be the case?

Wait, perhaps the problem is a typo and meant to ask for the vibrational transition. So the answer would be D.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, which would have a higher energy than J=1. But that wouldn't make sense as the next state.

Another thought: perhaps the question is about the photon causing a transition to the next state in the rotational-vibration model, which is the next state in terms of quantum

---------------

 numbers, not energy. But the question specifies the next state with the lowest possible energy.

I'm stuck. The calculations say

---------------

 that the rotational transition is lower in energy, but the options don't match. So perhaps the intended answer is D, 

---------------

1.4e-28 kg m/s, which corresponds to the vibrational transition.

But why? Unless I made a mistake in the calculation of E_rot. Let me compute E_rot again.

Wait, E_rot = ħ²/(I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.207e-46).

Compute numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 = (1.0545718)^2 * 1e-68 = approx 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 1.207e-46.

So E_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.207e-46 = 9.21e-23 J.

Yes.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the question

---------------

 is referring to the transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=2), but that's a higher energy transition. No, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the model used in the question treats the rotational energy differently. For instance, sometimes the rotational energy is modeled as (J + ½) ħω_rot, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next vibrational state (v=1), regardless of rotation, but that would require a photon with E = ħω =4.2e-20 J, which gives p=1.4e-28 kg m/s (option D).

So perhaps despite the rotational transition being lower, the problem expects the answer to be D.

I think I'll go with that. So the answer is D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences in the quantum rotation-vibration model. The fundamental state corresponds to \( v = 0 \) (lowest vibrational state) and \( J = 0 \) (lowest rotational state). The next state with the lowest energy could either be \( v = 1, J = 0 \) (vibrational transition) or \( v = 0, J = 1 \) (rotational transition). The energy required for each transition is calculated as follows:

### 1. **Rotational Transition (\( J = 0 \to J = 1 \))**
The rotational energy levels are given by:
\[
E_J = \frac{J(J+1)\hbar^2}{2I}
\]
where \( I = \mu R^2 \) is the moment of inertia, \( \mu \) is the reduced mass, and \( R \) is the bond length. The energy difference for the transition \( J = 0 \to J = 1 \) is:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = E_1 - E_0 = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}
\]
The reduced mass \( \mu \) is calculated as:
\[
\mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y}
\]
Given \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \) and \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \), we find:
\[
\mu = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
\]
Converting to kilograms (\( 1 \, \text{amu} \approx 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)):
\[
\mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
\]
The bond length \( R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), so:
\[
I = \mu R^2 = (3.018 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
\]
The rotational energy difference is:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}
\]
Using \( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \):
\[
\hbar^2 \approx (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2 \approx 1.112 \times 10^{-68} \, \text{J}^2 \cdot \text{s}^2
\]
\[
\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1.112 \times 10^{-68}}{1.207 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
\]

### 2. **Vibrational Transition (\( v = 0 \to v = 1 \))**
The vibrational energy levels are given by:
\[
E_v = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar \omega
\]
The energy difference for the transition \( v = 0 \to v = 1 \) is:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega
\]
Given \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \):
\[
\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
\]

### 3. **Comparison of Transition Energies**
The rotational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), while the vibrational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \approx 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \). The rotational transition requires significantly less energy. However, none of the provided options match the momentum corresponding to the rotational transition (\( p = \Delta E / c \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)).

### 4. **Photon Momentum for Vibrational Transition**
If the question instead refers to the vibrational transition, the momentum of the photon is:
\[
p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s}
\]
This matches option **D** (\( p = 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \)).

### Conclusion
Although the rotational transition requires less energy, the provided options suggest that the question intends for the vibrational transition to be considered. Therefore, the correct answer is:
