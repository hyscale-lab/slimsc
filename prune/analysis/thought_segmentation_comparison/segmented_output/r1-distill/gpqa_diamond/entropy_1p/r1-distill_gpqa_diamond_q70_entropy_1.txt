Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me read it again. Hmm, it's about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

So, the setup: five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered via the TTV method. They're in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Same albedo for all, so that shouldn

---------------

't complicate things.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature of a planet. It depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh right, the formula is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), where T_star is the star's effective temperature, R is its radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance. But wait, actually

---------------

, the exact formula might be T = (L/(16πσ a² (1 - A)))^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, A is the albedo, and a is the semi-major axis (distance). Since all planets have the same albedo, A is the same for all, so when taking the ratio, that cancels out.

Alternatively, another

---------------

 version I've heard is T_eq = T_star * (R_star/(2a))^(1/2). Because the star's luminosity is L = 4πR²σT_star⁴, so substituting that into the first equation would give the same result. So either

---------------

 way, the key is the ratio of their distances.

But wait, the problem gives the orbital periods in a ratio. So the periods are P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures, which depends on their distances from the star.

But

---------------

 wait, Kepler's third law comes into play here. Kepler's law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a³). So P² ∝ a³. So the ratio of a's can be found from the ratio of the periods.

So for any two planets, say Planet_i and Planet_j, (a_i / a_j) = (P_i / P_j)^(2/3). Because P² is proportional to a³, so a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So,

---------------

 the equilibrium temperature ratio would be (T_eq4 / T_eq2) = (a2 / a4)^(1/2), because T_eq is inversely proportional to the square root of a. Because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), so higher a means lower T.

Wait, let's get this straight. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)). So T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So if a increases, T decreases. So the ratio T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2) * (T_star same for all) * (R_star same for all, so cancels out).

So let

---------------

's compute a2 and a4. Since the periods are in ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, so

---------------

 P2 is 2 units, P4 is 3.5 units.

So the ratio a2 / a4 = (P2 / P4)^(2/3). Because a ∝ P^(2/3).

So let me compute P2/P4: 2 / 3.5. That's the same as 4/7, since 2 ÷ 3.5 = 4/7. So (4/7)^(2/3).

Wait, let

---------------

's compute that.

First, 4/7 is approximately 0.5714. Raising that to the power of 2/3.

Alternatively, 

---------------

4/7 = (2^2)/(7^1). So (4/7)^(2/3) = [ (2^2)/(7) ]^(2/3) = 2^(4/3) * 7^(-2/3). Hmm, not sure if that helps numerically.

Alternatively, think

---------------

 about taking the cube root first. The cube root of 4/7 is approximately (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.829. Then square that: (0.829)^2 ≈ 0.687. So about 0.687.

Wait, but wait, (

---------------

4/7) is (approx 0.5714). Let's calculate 0.5714^(2/3). Another approach: take natural log. ln(0.5714) ≈ -0.555. Multiply by 2/3: -0.37. Exponentiate: e^-0.37 ≈ 0.689. So about 0.689.

So a2/a4 ≈ 0.689. Then, the temperature ratio T4/T2 is sqrt(0.689). Because T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4). So sqrt(0.689) ≈ 0.83. Wait, wait: because

---------------

 T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so T4 = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a4)), and T2 = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a2)). So T4/T2 = sqrt( (R/(2a4)) / (R/(2a2)) ) = sqrt(a2/a4).

So yes

---------------

, T4/T2 is sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt( (a2/a4) ) = sqrt( ( (P2/P4)^(2/3) ) ) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Wait, wait, let me clarify. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake.

a

---------------

 ∝ P^(2/3). So a2 = (P2)^(2/3) * k, and a4 = (P4)^(2/3) * k, where k is a constant.

So a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3). So sqrt

---------------

(a2/a4) is (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Because sqrt( (P2/P4)^(2/3) ) ) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

So T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

So P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5. So 2/3.5 is 4/7. So (4/7)^(1/3). Let's compute that.

The cube root of 4 is about 1.5874. The cube root of 7 is about 1.913. So 1.5874 / 1.913 ≈ 0.829. So about 0.829. So T4 is about 0.829 times T2.

Wait, but the question asks for the ratio of Planet_4 to Planet_2, which is T4/T2. So that's approximately 0.829, which is close to option C, which is ~0.83. But wait, looking at the options:

Options:
A) ~0.57
B) ~0.69
C) ~0.83
D) ~0.75

So 0.83 is option C. But wait, let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't mix up anything.

Wait, when I calculated

---------------

 T4/T2, I had that as (P2/P4)^(1/3). Because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), and a is proportional to P^(2/3). So T ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)).

So T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3). So yes

---------------

, that's correct.

Wait, another way to think about it: since T ∝ 1/(a^(1/2)) and a ∝ P^(2/3), then T ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)). So T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3). Yes.

So the ratio is (2/3.5)^(1/3). 2/3.5 is 4/7, which is approximately 0.571. The cube root of 0.571 is about 0.829, which is ~0.83. So option C.

Wait, but wait, another thought. Are

---------------

 the periods in the order 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, so the periods are P1=1, P2=2, P3=2.5, P4=3.5, P5=5. So P2=2, P4=3.5.

So the

---------------

 ratio is P2/P4 = 2/3.5 = 4/7.

Yes, that's correct.

So T4/T2 = (4/7)^(1/3). Let me compute that more accurately.

4/7 is approximately 0.57142857.

The cube root of 0.57142857.

I know that 0.7 cubed is 0.343. 0.8 cubed is 0.512. 0.83^3 = let's compute 0.83*0.83=0.6889, then *0.83= approx 0.5717. Oh, that's very close to 0.5714. So 0.83^3 ≈ 0.5717. So the cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83.

So T4/T2 ≈ 0.83. So the ratio is about 0.83, so the answer is C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance. The equilibrium temperature \( T_{\text{eq}} \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance \( a \), i.e., \( T_{\text{eq}} \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \). From Kepler's third law, \( a \propto P^{2/3} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period. Thus, \( T_{\text{eq}} \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \).

The orbital periods of the planets are in the ratio \( 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \). For Planet_2 and Planet_4, the periods are \( P_2 = 2 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5 \). The ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is given by:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_4} \right)^{1/3}.
\]

Substituting \( P_2 = 2 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5 \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.571.
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.83.
\]

Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately \( 0.83 \), which corresponds to option C.
