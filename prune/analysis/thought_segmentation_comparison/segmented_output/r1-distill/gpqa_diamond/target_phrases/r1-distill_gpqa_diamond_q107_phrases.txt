Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem states that there's a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, which I think is the z-axis. The magnetic field has a value of 1 Tesla, and the orbital magnetic quantum number m has small values. So m is small, which probably means it's in the range of -1, 0, 1, maybe up to a couple higher, but not extremely large.

The question is about comparing the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term (which I believe is the energy due to the magnetic field interacting with the electron's magnetic moment) with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The transition has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers, which I recognize as the wavelength for the Balmer series, specifically the H-alpha line, corresponding to a transition in hydrogen from n=2 to n=1. 

---------------

Wait, no, wait—Balmer series is n=2 to n=1? Or maybe I'm mixing that up. 

---------------

Wait, the Balmer series is transitions to n=2, so H-alpha is n=3 to n=2. Oh, but the exact details might not matter here; what matters is the energy scale of ΔE.

So, the problem is asking whether the paramagnetic term is much larger, much smaller, or about the same as ΔE. The options are A to D, with A saying they're equal, B that paramagnetic term is much greater, C much smaller, D that it's larger.

I need to compute the order of magnitude for both terms and compare them.

Let's start with the transition energy ΔE. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by the Rydberg formula. The energy of an electron in the nth level is E_n = - (13.6 eV) / n². So the transition energy ΔE is the difference between two energy levels. Let's say from n=2 to n=1, for example. E_2 is -13.6 /4 = -3.4 eV, E_1 is -13.6 eV. So ΔE = E_1 - E_2 = (-13.6) - (-3.4) = -10.2 eV. But we're considering the magnitude, so 10.2 eV. 

---------------

Wait, but the wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers. Oh wait, that's the wavelength of the emitted photon. So the energy ΔE corresponds to the photon's energy. Let me compute ΔE using the wavelength.

The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. The speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 0.4861e-6 meters.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.4861e-6) = let's compute that.

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 0.4861e-6 m: 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 ≈ 4.086e-19 J.

Convert that to electron volts. Since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so E = 4.086e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV.



---------------

Wait, that doesn't match the previous calculation of 10.2 eV. Hmm, perhaps because I chose the wrong transition. Oh, right, the Balmer-alpha line is from n=3 to n=2, which would be a smaller energy difference than n=2 to n=1. Let me compute that. E3 = -13.6 /9 ≈ -1.511 eV. E2 is -3.4 eV. So ΔE would be E2 - E3 = (-3.4) - (-1.511) = -1.889 eV. The magnitude is about 1.89 eV. 

---------------

But wait, the photon energy from the wavelength was about 2.55 eV. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the wavelength provided is for a different transition. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the Balmer-alpha line, but perhaps my initial approach is better to compute ΔE via the Rydberg formula.



---------------

Alternatively, let's compute it using the Rydberg formula: 1/λ = R (1/n1² - 1/n2²), where R is the Rydberg constant, approximately 1.097e4 m^-1. For Balmer-alpha, n1=2, n2=3. So 1/λ = 1.097e4 (1/4 - 1/9) = 1.097e4 ( (9-4)/(36) )= 1.097e4 * (5/36) ≈ 1.097e4 * 0.1389 ≈ 1.537e3 m^-1. So λ ≈ 1/(1.537e3) ≈ 6.5e-4 m, which is 650 nm, which is about 0.65 micrometers. But the given λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is about 486 nm. That's the H-alpha line, but wait, H-alpha is n=3 to n=2, which gives 656 nm. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. 

---------------

Alternatively, maybe it's another line. Alternatively, perhaps it's the Lyman series. Let me check: Lyman-alpha is n=2 to n=1, which gives about 121.6 nm. So that's 0.1216 micrometers. The given λ is 0.4861, which is in the visible range, so Balmer series. So for Balmer-alpha, λ≈656 nm (0.656 micrometers). But the problem gives 0.4861 micrometers, which is about 486 nm, which is the H-alpha line. 

---------------

Wait, no, H-alpha is 656 nm. Hmm, perhaps the given λ corresponds to a different transition. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I should just proceed with the given λ to compute the energy.

Using the given λ=0.4861e-6 m, E=hc/λ.

h=6.626e-34 Js, c=3e8 m/s.

E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.4861e-6) = (1.9878e-25) / (4.861e-7) = wait, wait, 0.4861e-6 m is 4.861e-7 m. So 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = approximately 4.086e-19 J.

Convert to eV: 4.086e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV.

So ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term. I think this refers to the Zeeman effect, which is the interaction of the magnetic moment of the electron with the external magnetic field. The energy term due to the Zeeman effect is given by H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) * (L + 2S), but for hydrogen, since it's a 1s orbital, S is 1/2. 

---------------

But wait, the problem states that m is small, which is the magnetic quantum number. Wait, the orbital quantum number is l, and m is the z-component, m_l. But for the hydrogen atom, the ground state (n=1) has l=0, so m=0. For higher states, like n=2, l can be 0 or 1, so m can be -1, 0, +1.



---------------

Wait, but the problem states that m is small, so perhaps it's considering m=0. But wait, the magnetic moment due to orbital angular momentum is μ_L = (eħ/(2m_e)) * m_l * l(l+1)^½, but for l=0, it's zero. So maybe the paramagnetic term is due to the spin part, but wait, spin is S, but the magnetic quantum number for spin is s=1/2, but the paramagnetic term is usually due to the spin-orbit interaction. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.



---------------

Wait, no. Wait, the paramagnetic effect in atoms is due to the spin of the electron. The paramagnetic term in the Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment due to spin. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = (g_s * μ_B) * S_z, where g_s is the gyromagnetic ratio (about 2), and μ_B is the Bohr magneton. The Bohr magneton is μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e) ≈ 9.274e-24 J/T.

So the energy term due to the magnetic field is H = -μ·B = -g_s μ_B m_s B, where m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number, which can be ±1/2.



---------------

Wait, but wait: for hydrogen, in the ground state, the electron has spin 1/2. So the possible m_s values are ±1/2. So the paramagnetic coupling energy would be H = -g_s μ_B m_s B.



---------------

But wait, the problem states that m is small, so perhaps they are considering m=0 for orbital angular momentum, but the spin is always contributing. Hmm, but the paramagnetic effect is due to spin, not orbital angular momentum. So perhaps the paramagnetic term is H = μ·B, where μ is the spin magnetic moment. So H = g_s μ_B m_s B.



---------------

But wait, the energy levels shift due to the magnetic field. The energy shift is approximately H = μ·B, which for a magnetic field in the z-direction is H = g_s μ_B m_s B.

Since m_s can be ±1/2, the maximum shift would be ± (g_s μ_B B) * (1/2). So the energy shift would be ± (1/2) g_s μ_B B.

Given that B is 1 T, let's compute this.

g_s is approximately 2. So:

H = 2 * μ_B * (1/2) * B = μ_B * B.



---------------

Wait, because m_s is 1/2, so H = g_s * μ_B * m_s * B. For m_s=1/2, H = 2 * μ_B * (1/2) * B = μ_B * B.

So H = μ_B * B.

μ_B is about 9.274e-24 J/T. So H = 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T = 9.274e-24 J.

Convert that to eV: 9.274e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.79e-5 eV.



---------------

Wait, that's a very small energy compared to the transition energy of 2.55 eV. So the paramagnetic term is much smaller than ΔE.



---------------

Wait, but wait. Did I get the correct expression for H? Let me think again. The paramagnetic term (Zeeman effect due to spin) is H = -μ·B = -g_s μ_B m_s B. So the energy shift is proportional to m_s B. Since m_s is ±1/2, the energy shift is ±(g_s μ_B B) (1/2).

So for B=1 T, H = ± (2 * 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T) * (1/2) ) = ±9.274e-24 J.

Which is about 5.79e-5 eV, as before.

So the paramagnetic coupling term is about 5.79e-5 eV, while the transition energy is about 2.55 eV.

Comparing these, the paramagnetic term is much smaller than ΔE. So ⟨H⟩ (the expectation value of the paramagnetic term) is much less than ΔE. So the correct option is C) ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE.


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, we analyze both terms based on the given parameters.

### Transition Energy (ΔE)
The transition energy ΔE corresponds to the energy difference between two energy levels of the hydrogen atom. Using the wavelength provided, λ = 0.4861 μm (486.1 nm), the energy of the photon is calculated using the formula:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 0.4861 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \). Substituting these values:

\[
E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{0.4861 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 4.086 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
\]

Converting this to electron volts (1 eV = \( 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
E \approx \frac{4.086 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}
\]

Thus, the transition energy ΔE is approximately **2.55 eV**.

### Paramagnetic Coupling Term
The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction of the electron's spin magnetic moment with the external magnetic field \( \vec{B} \). The energy shift due to this interaction is given by:

\[
H = g_s \mu_B m_s B
\]

where:
- \( g_s \approx 2 \) is the spin gyromagnetic ratio,
- \( \mu_B = \frac{e \hbar}{2 m_e} \approx 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton,
- \( m_s = \pm \frac{1}{2} \) is the spin magnetic quantum number,
- \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \) is the magnetic field strength.

Substituting these values:

\[
H = 2 \cdot (9.274 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}
\]

Converting this to electron volts:

\[
H \approx \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}
\]

Thus, the paramagnetic coupling term is approximately **5.79 × 10⁻⁵ eV**.

---

### Comparison
The transition energy ΔE is approximately **2.55 eV**, while the paramagnetic coupling term is approximately **5.79 × 10⁻⁵ eV**. Clearly, the paramagnetic coupling term is many orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy. Therefore, the correct comparison is:

\[
\langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E
\]

**Answer: C**
