Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about scattering amplitudes and phase shifts. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says that we've got phase shifts δ₀ to δ₄ with specific values: 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13°. The energy is 50 MeV electrons scattering elastically from a nuclear target. We're supposed to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, and ignore the rest of the phase shifts. The options are given in fm, which I think stands for femtometers, but I'm not entirely sure. 

---------------

Oh wait, fm is 1e-15 meters, right.

Hmm. I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) can be expressed using partial waves. The general formula for f is a sum over l of (something with the phase shifts δ_l) multiplied by spherical harmonics or something. 

---------------

Wait, I think the formula is:

f(θ, φ) = (1/k) Σ [ (2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ) ]



---------------

But wait, I think there's a factor of i involved when you're considering the imaginary part. Because the scattering amplitude's imaginary part relates to the inelastic part, but in elastic scattering, maybe only certain terms contribute. Oh, but wait, the question is specifically about the imaginary part along the incident direction. So θ would be zero in that case because the scattering angle is zero, meaning the particle goes straight through without changing direction.



---------------

Wait, but wait. The scattering angle θ is the angle between the incident and scattered particles. So if the scattering is along the beam direction, θ would be 0°, because the scattered particle is moving in the same direction as the incident. Or wait, maybe 180°? No, no. 

---------------

Wait, no. Let's think. The incident beam is along, say, the z-axis. If the scattered particle is moving in the same direction as the incident, then θ is 0°, right? So that's the forward direction.

So, the formula for f(θ, φ) would be:

f(θ, φ) = (1/k) Σ [ (2l + 1) (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ) e^{i l φ} ]

But since we're looking at the direction along the incident beam, θ is 0°, so cosθ is 1. Also, φ is zero, because the scattering is along the beam direction, so the angle around the axis is zero. So the exponential term e^{i l φ} becomes 1.

So the scattering amplitude simplifies to:

f(0,0) = (1/k) Σ [ (2l + 1) (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) P_l(1) ]



---------------

But wait, P_l(1) is the Legendre polynomial evaluated at 1. I remember that P_l(1) is 1 for all l, because when x=1, all the associated Legendre polynomials reduce to 1. So that simplifies things.

So f(0,0) = (1/k) Σ [ (2l + 1) (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) ]



---------------

But wait, this is the full amplitude. The question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So let's take the imaginary part of f(0,0):

Im[f(0,0)] = (1/k) Σ [ (2l + 1) Im( e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ) ]

Because each term is (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1), and the sum is over l=0 to 4, since we're ignoring higher phase shifts.

Now, let's compute e^{2iδ_l} -1. Let me write this as e^{i 2 δ_l} -1. The imaginary part of this is sin(2 δ_l), because e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, so e^{iθ} -1 = (cosθ -1) + i sinθ. So the imaginary part is sin(2δ_l).

So, Im( e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ) = sin(2 δ_l )

So putting it all together:

Im[f(0,0)] = (1/k) Σ [ (2l + 1) sin(2 δ_l) ]

Now, what's k? k is the wave number. The electrons have energy 50 MeV. 

---------------

Wait, the electrons are non-relativistic? Hmm, 50 MeV is a lot for electrons. Let me think: the rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, so 50 MeV is much larger, so relativistic effects are significant. So the relation between energy and momentum is a bit more involved.

But for electrons, the energy E is related to the momentum p via E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2. Since E is 50 MeV, m c^2 is 0.511 MeV, so E is approximately 50 MeV, much larger than m c². So we can approximate E ≈ p c. So p ≈ E/(c) → but wait, E is in MeV, and p would be in MeV/c. Then, the wave number k is p/(ħ). Since ħ c is about 197.33 MeV fm (I think that's the value), so 197.33 MeV fm ≈ ħ c. So, k = p/(ħ) = (E/c) / ħ = E/(ħ c) = (E) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) * (1/fm) )



---------------

Wait, let me get the units right. Let me compute k.

E = 50 MeV.

p ≈ E/c, so p = 50 MeV/c.

k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / (ħ) )

But ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm. So, ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

So substituting, k = (50 MeV/c) / ( (197.33 MeV fm)/c ) )

The c's cancel. The MeV cancels.

So k = 50 / 197.33 (1/fm) ) → approximately 0.253 fm⁻¹.



---------------

Wait, 50 / 197.33 is approximately 0.253. So k ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So 1/k is approximately 1 / 0.253 ≈ 3.9526 fm.

So, 1/k ≈ 3.9526 fm.

Now, let's compute each term (2l + 1) * sin(2 δ_l )

We have l=0 to l=4.

Let's make a table:

l | δ_l (degrees) | 2 δ_l (degrees) | sin(2 δ_l) | (2l+1) | term
---|-------------|----------------|------------|--------|-----
0 | 90          | 180            | 0           | 1      | 0
1 | 67          | 134            | sin(134°)   | 3      | 3 * sin(134)
2 |55           | 110            | sin(110)    |5       |5 sin(110)
3 |30           |60              | sin(60)     |7       |7 sin(60)
4 |13           |26              | sin(26)     |9       |9 sin(26)



---------------

Wait, wait. Let me compute each term correctly.

But wait, for l=0: 2l+1 is 1. 2δ₀ is 180°, sin(180) is 0. So term is 0.

l=1: 2δ=134°, sin(134) is sin(180-46)= sin(46)=approx 0.7193. So term is 3 * 0.7193 ≈ 2.1579.

l=2: 2δ=110°, sin(110)= sin(70)=approx 0.9397. So term is 5 * 0.9397 ≈4.6985.

l=3: 2δ=60°, sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660. Term is7 *0.8660≈6.062.

l=4: 2δ=26°, sin(26)= approx 0.4384. Term is9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Now, sum all the terms except l=0 (which is zero):

2.1579 + 4.6985 = 6.8564

6.8564 +6.062=12.9184

12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

So sum is 16.864.

Now, multiply by 1/k, which is approximately 3.9526 fm.

So Im(f(0,0)) = 3.9526 fm * 16.864 ≈ ?

Let me compute 3.9526 * 16.864.

First, 3.95 * 16 = 63.2

3.95 * 0.864 ≈ 3.95 * 0.8 =3.16, 3.95 * 0.064≈0.2528 → total ≈3.4128.

So 63.2 +3.4128≈66.6128.



---------------

But wait, more accurately: 3.9526 *16.864.

Let me compute:

16.864 = 16 + 0.864.

3.9526 *16 = 63.2416.

3.9526 *0.864:

Compute 3.9526 *0.8 = 3.16208

3.9526 *0.06 = 0.237156

3.9526 *0.004 =0.0158104

Add them: 3.16208 +0.237156=3.399236 +0.0158104=3.4150464.

Total Im(f) =63.2416 +3.4150464≈66.6566 fm.



---------------

Wait, but wait! The options are around 177, 251, etc. So 66.6 is nowhere near. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?



---------------

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-examine each step.

Wait a second, I think I may have confused the formula for the imaginary part. Because, in the expression for f(θ, φ), the amplitude is a sum over l of (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l(1), divided by k.



---------------

But wait, when I take the imaginary part, I have to consider each term's contribution. Alternatively, perhaps I should be considering the sum of (2l+1) times the sine of 2δ_l, because Im[e^{2iδ_l} -1] = sin(2δ_l), right?



---------------

Wait, let me recheck the earlier steps.

Im(f) = (1/k) * sum [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ]



---------------

Wait, but I think I might have missed a factor. Because, e^{iθ} -1 = e^{iθ/2} (e^{iθ/2} - e^{-iθ/2}) ) → e^{iθ/2} * 2i sin(θ/2). So, e^{iθ} -1 = 2i e^{iθ/2} sin(θ/2). So the imaginary part is 2 e^{iθ/2} sin(θ/2) → but the imaginary part of (e^{iθ} -1) is 2 sin(theta/2) * cos(theta/2 + 0) )? 

---------------

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute directly.

Wait, e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ. So e^{iθ} -1 = (cosθ -1) + i sinθ. So the imaginary part is sinθ.

So in our case, θ is 2δ_l, so the imaginary part is sin(2δ_l). So that part is correct.

So my earlier approach is correct.

But why is the result so low compared to the options? The options are in the hundreds of fm. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of k. Let me re-examine that.

E =50 MeV, which is the kinetic energy? Or the total energy? Oh, in particle physics, when given an energy for a particle, it's usually the kinetic energy. 

---------------

Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, for electrons, 50 MeV is their kinetic energy. So their total energy would be K + m c², but since m c² is 0.511 MeV, which is much smaller than 50 MeV, so E ≈ 50 MeV.



---------------

Wait, but E is the total energy, so E = gamma m c^2. Then, the momentum p is gamma m v. 

---------------

Alternatively, using E² = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

So E = 50 MeV, m c² = 0.511 MeV.

So p c = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) ) → sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ) ≈ sqrt(2500) ≈50 MeV.

So p c ≈50 MeV → p ≈50 MeV / c.

So k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / ħ.

But ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

Thus, k = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c) ) → 50 /197.33 ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

So 1/k ≈3.952 fm.



---------------

Wait, that's correct. So 1/k is about 3.952 fm.

So the sum of the terms was 16.864, so 3.952 *16.864 ≈66.66 fm.

But none of the options are close to that. The options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Hmm. So I'm getting about 66.6 fm, but the options are much larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I should not have included l=0. Let me check the initial formula.

Wait, the formula for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ, φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) (e^{2i δ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ) [e^{i l φ} ] / (k)



---------------

But wait, in the case where the target is spinless, the amplitude is given by this expression. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact expression. Maybe I missed a factor of i.



---------------

Wait, another thought: the scattering amplitude is f(θ, φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) (e^{2i δ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ) e^{i l φ} / k.

But when taking the imaginary part, I have to consider that the overall amplitude might have an imaginary component.



---------------

Wait, but the formula for the total cross-section is 4π |f|^2, but that's not directly relevant here.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I should be considering the partial wave expansion for the amplitude, but perhaps I should be taking the imaginary part of each term. Or maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of k.



---------------

Wait, let me think about the units again. Because when I calculated 1/k, I got about 3.95 fm. But perhaps the actual value of k is different.



---------------

Wait, let me compute k more accurately.

E =50 MeV.

p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2 ) ≈50 MeV.

So p = (50 MeV) / c.

k = p / ħ.

But ħ c =197.33 MeV fm.

So, ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

So,

k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) ) → the c's cancel, MeV cancels.

k =50 / 197.33 ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

So 1/k ≈3.952 fm.

That's correct. So that part is right.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me think about the formula again.

Wait, the formula for the scattering amplitude is f = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) (e^{2i δ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ) e^{i l φ} /k.

But when θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so f(0,0)= sum (2l+1)(e^{2i δ_l} -1) /k.

Then, the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ) /k.

So that's correct.

Hmm, but perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians instead of degrees? No, the question says degrees.



---------------

Wait, maybe I should have converted the phase shifts to radians before computing the sine function. Because the calculation of sin(2δ_l) uses the angle in radians, right? Oh, that's a crucial point. I think I might have made a mistake here.



---------------

Wait, in the calculation, I used degrees, but the sine function in the formula expects the angle in radians. So I should have converted the phase shifts from degrees to radians before computing the sine.

Ah! That's probably where I went wrong. So let me recalculate each term correctly.

So for each l, compute δ_l in radians, multiply by 2, compute sin(2δ_l in radians).

Let me compute each term again with this in mind.

First, compute 2δ_l in radians.

l=0: 180 degrees → π radians. sin(π) is 0. So term is 0.

l=1: 2δ=134 degrees → 134 * π/180 ≈ 2.340 radians. sin(2.340) ≈ ?

Let me compute sin(2.340):

2.340 radians is about 134 degrees (as it should be). The sin of 134 degrees is positive because it's in the second quadrant. So sin(134) ≈ 0.6691 (wait, wait, earlier I thought it was 0.7193, but that's incorrect because 134 degrees is 180-46, so sin(134)=sin(46)≈0.7193, but wait, wait, wait. 

---------------

Wait, 134 degrees is 180-46, so sin(134) = sin(46) ≈0.7193. So why the discrepancy? Because in radians, 2.340 radians is approximately 134 degrees. So sin(2.340)= sin(134 degrees)=0.7193.



---------------

Wait, but wait. Let me compute 2.340 radians in terms of degrees: 2.340 * (180/pi) ≈ 134 degrees. So yes, sin(2.340) ≈0.7193.

So term l=1: 3 * 0.7193≈2.1579.

l=2: 2δ=110 degrees → 110 * pi/180 ≈1.9199 radians. sin(1.9199) is sin(110 degrees)=sin(70)≈0.9397.

Term:5 * 0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3: 2δ=60 degrees → pi/3 radians≈1.0472. sin(1.0472)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.8660. Term:7 *0.8660≈6.062.

l=4: 2δ=26 degrees → 26 * pi/180 ≈0.4538 radians. sin(0.4538)≈0.4384. Term:9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

So the sum is the same as before: 2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564; +6.062→12.9184; +3.9456→16.864.

So same sum as before. So 1/k is about 3.952 fm. 3.952 *16.864≈66.66 fm.

But the options are in the hundreds. So I must have made another mistake.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the formula includes a factor of 2pi somewhere? Or maybe I should have considered the fact that the phase shifts are given for each l, and perhaps I missed a factor in the formula.



---------------

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f = (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} (e^{2i δ_l} -1) ]? No, that doesn't seem right. Let me recheck.

The correct formula for the scattering amplitude in partial waves is:

f(θ, φ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{2i δ_l} (e^{-2i δ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ) e^{i l φ} }



---------------

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I might have the formula wrong. The standard expression is:

f(θ, φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) (e^{2i δ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ) e^{i l φ} / k.



---------------

Wait, but in some references, the expression is written as:

f(θ, φ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{2i δ_l} (e^{-2i δ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ) e^{i l φ} }

No, that doesn't make sense. Because e^{2i δ_l} (e^{-2i δ_l} -1) = (1 - e^{2i δ_l} ), which is the negative of the original term. So perhaps I should double-check the formula.



---------------

Wait, let's refer to the partial wave expansion. The scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(θ, φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) (e^{2i δ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ) e^{i l φ} /k.

So the initial approach was correct.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the question is about the total cross-section, but no, it's about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.



---------------

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should have considered the sum from l=0 to l=4, but in the problem statement, it says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts. So maybe we are only considering up to l=4, which is what I did.

Hmm. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians. But the question states degrees, so that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of k is wrong. Because for electrons, relativistic effects are significant, and perhaps the relation E = pc is not accurate. Let me re-examine that.

E² = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

E = 50 MeV.

So pc = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2 ) = sqrt(50^2 - (0.511)^2) ≈50 MeV.

So p = (50 MeV ) / c.

But then, k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) ) → 50/(197.33) ≈0.253 fm⁻¹. So 1/k ≈3.952 fm. So that's correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the possible options. Maybe the correct calculation gives one of the options, but I'm getting 66.66 fm, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.



---------------

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (2l+1) * (e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) /k, but the imaginary part of this is (2l+1) * Im( e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) /k.



---------------

Wait, but that's the same as before. So perhaps I should consider that the phase shifts are in radians, but that doesn't change the calculation since I already accounted for that.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I forgot to multiply by 1/k correctly. Let me recompute 1/k * sum.

Sum is 16.864.

1/k is approximately 3.952 fm.

So 16.864 *3.952 fm ≈66.66 fm.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the question is about the total scattering cross-section, which would be 4π |f|^2. But no, the question specifically asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the imaginary part of the amplitude multiplied by k, i.e., k Im(f).



---------------

Wait, let me think. Because sometimes, in scattering theory, the optical theorem states that the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude (k f(0,0)) is related to the total cross-section.

The optical theorem says that:

k Im(f(0,0)) = - (1/(4π)) ∫ |f|^2 dΩ.

But perhaps the question is simply asking for Im(f(0,0)), not multiplied by k.



---------------

Wait, but according to our calculation, Im(f) is about 66.66 fm. But the options are much higher.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me recheck the formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for f is (1/k) sum [ (2l +1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l(1) e^{i l 0} ].

Which is the same as (1/k) sum [ (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1) ].

So the imaginary part is (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) ].

So that's what I did.

Hmm. I'm not seeing where the mistake is. But the options are way higher, so perhaps I should think about whether the phase shifts are given in radians. 

---------------

Wait, the question says degrees, so no.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, but the problem says degrees. Let me try converting the phase shifts to radians and see what happens.



---------------

Wait, for l=0, δ=90 degrees → π/2 radians. 2δ=π → sin(pi)=0.

l=1: δ=67 degrees → 67 * pi/180 ≈1.169 radians. 2δ≈2.338 radians. sin(2.338)= sin(134 degrees)≈0.6691.



---------------

Wait, earlier I thought it was 0.7193, but in radians, 2.338 is about 134 degrees, whose sine is about 0.6691.



---------------

Wait, wait no. Wait, 67 degrees is 67 * pi/180 ≈1.169 radians. 2δ is 134 degrees, which is 2.340 radians. sin(2.340) is about 0.7193.



---------------

Wait, no, no. Wait, 2.340 radians is 134 degrees, whose sine is sin(134) = sin(46)≈0.7193.

So that part was correct. So that's not the issue.

Hmm. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (2l+1) * (e^{2iδ_l} -1) divided by (k), but I have to consider that the phase shifts are given for each partial wave, and perhaps the formula includes a factor of 2 somewhere.



---------------

Wait, maybe I should have considered that the phase shifts are given for each l, and the formula is:

Im(f) = (1/k) sum [ (2l + 1) sin(2 δ_l) ]

Which is what I did.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the phase shifts are given as δ_0=90 degrees, which is pi/2 radians. So 2δ_0=pi, whose sine is zero, which is correct.

Hmm.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the scattering amplitude is f = sum [ (2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) ] / (k), but I'm not sure.



---------------

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should have included the factor of 2 in the denominator. Because sometimes the formula for the scattering amplitude is written as:

f(θ, φ) = (1/k) sum [ (2l +1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ) e^{i l φ} ]

So that's what I used.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 1/k.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I should compute k more accurately.

E=50 MeV.

p c = sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2 ) ≈50 MeV.

p =50 MeV/c.

k = p / ħ.

But ħ c =197.33 MeV fm.

So, k = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm /c ) ) → 50/(197.33) ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

So 1/k=3.952 fm.



---------------

Wait, another thought: perhaps the wave number k is in units of inverse meters, not inverse fm. Because 1 fm =1e-15 meters. 

---------------

Oh wait, no. Wait, no, no. The calculation is correct in terms of units.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the momentum in units of MeV/c, but the calculation is correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again. The options are much larger than my calculated 66.6 fm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.



---------------

Wait, let me recheck the sum:

l=0: 1 * sin(180) → 0.

l=1: 3 * sin(134 degrees) →3 *0.7193=2.1579.

l=2:5 * sin(110) →5 *0.9397=4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60) →7 *0.8660=6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26) →9 *0.4384=3.9456.

Sum: 2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564; +6.062=12.9184; +3.9456=16.864.

So sum is 16.864.

Multiply by 1/k=3.952 fm: 16.864 *3.952 ≈66.66 fm.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (1/k) times the sum of (2l+1) times (e^{i 2 δ_l} -1 ), but without taking the imaginary part. 

---------------

Wait, no, that can't be, because the question asks for the imaginary part.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (1/k) times the sum of (2l+1) times (e^{i 2 δ_l} -1 ), and then take the imaginary part.



---------------

Wait, but that's what I did. So I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f = sum [ (2l+1) (e^{i (2 δ_l)} -1 ) ] / (k).

Then, Im(f) = sum [ (2l+1) Im( e^{i (2 δ_l)} -1 ) ] /k.

Which is sum [ (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) ] /k.

Which is what I did.

Hmm.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the phase shifts are given in the form of e^{2i δ_l} = cos(2 δ_l) + i sin(2 δ_l), so e^{2i δ_l} -1 = (cos(2 δ_l) -1) + i sin(2 δ_l).

Thus, the imaginary part is sin(2 δ_l).

So that's correct.



---------------

Another thought: perhaps the question is about the real part, not the imaginary part. But the question clearly states the imaginary part.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the phase shifts are given in the form of e^{i δ_l}.



---------------

Wait, no, the phase shifts are given as δ_l, and the formula uses e^{2i δ_l}.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I should have used e^{i δ_l} instead of e^{2i δ_l}.

No, the standard formula uses e^{2i δ_l}.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the formula is f = sum [ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1) ] /k.

No, that doesn't make sense.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach.



---------------

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is referring to the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude multiplied by k. Because in some contexts, the quantity k Im(f) is used.

So, let's compute k Im(f) = sum [ (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) ].

Which would be sum 16.864.

So, 16.864.

But looking at the options, 16.864 is still not matching any option.



---------------

Wait, the options are in the hundreds. So perhaps I should multiply by 1000 or something. No, that doesn't make sense.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, not degrees. Let me try that.

So, if the phase shifts are in radians, then:

l=0: δ=90 degrees = 1.5708 radians. 2δ=3.1416 radians. sin(3.1416)=0.

l=1: δ=67 degrees →67 * pi/180≈1.169 radians. 2δ≈2.338 radians. sin(2.338)=approx 0.7193.

l=2:55 degrees →55 * pi/180≈0.9599 radians. 2δ=1.9198 radians. sin(1.9198)= approx 0.9397.

l=3:30 degrees →0.5236 radians. 2δ=1.0472 radians. sin(1.0472)=0.8660.

l=4:13 degrees →0.2269 radians. 2δ=0.4538 radians. sin(0.4538)=0.4384.

So the same sum as before: 16.864.

So, that doesn't change anything.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Perhaps the correct answer is 66.66 fm, but it's not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.



---------------

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f = (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) (e^{i (2 δ_l)} -1) P_l(1) ].

So, the imaginary part is (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) ].

Which is what I did. So I'm confident in that part.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the given phase shifts are the real parts, and the imaginary parts are zero. No, the phase shifts are given as the entire phase shift, which includes both real and imaginary parts. But the problem states that we have measured phase shifts, so they're given as real values in degrees.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the sum, multiply by (1/k), and then see which option it matches. But none of the options match 66.66 fm.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum. Let me recompute the sum:

l=0: 0.

l=1: 3 * sin(134) =3 *0.7193=2.1579.

l=2:5 *0.9397=4.6985.

l=3:7 *0.8660=6.062.

l=4:9 *0.4384=3.9456.

Sum: 2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564; +6.062=12.9184; +3.9456=16.864.

So sum is correct.



---------------

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (2l+1) times (e^{i (2 δ_l)} -1 ), and the sum is then divided by k. So Im(f) = sum [ (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) ] /k.

Which is the same as before.

Hmm.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the real part instead of the imaginary part. Let's compute the real part.

The real part would be sum [ (2l+1) (cos(2 δ_l) -1 ) ] /k.

Let's compute each term.

l=0: cos(180)= -1 → cos(180)-1= -2 → term: 1*(-2)= -2.

l=1: cos(134 degrees)=cos(180-46)= -cos(46)= approx -0.6947. So cos(134)-1= -0.6947 -1= -1.6947. Term:3*(-1.6947)= -5.0841.

l=2: cos(110)=cos(180-70)= -cos(70)= approx -0.3420. cos(110)-1= -0.3420-1= -1.3420. Term:5*(-1.3420)= -6.71.

l=3: cos(60)=0.5. cos(60)-1= -0.5. Term:7*(-0.5)= -3.5.

l=4: cos(26)=approx 0.8988. cos(26)-1= -0.1012. Term:9*(-0.1012)= -0.9108.

Sum: -2 -5.0841= -7.0841; -6.71= -13.7941; -3.5= -17.2941; -0.9108= -18.2049.

So Re(f)= -18.2049 /k → -18.2049 /3.952 ≈-4.606 fm.

But the question is about the imaginary part, so that's not relevant.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should try to look for the answer in the options, considering that perhaps the sum is 16.864, and 16.864 * something gives one of the options.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 177.675 fm.

177.675 /3.952 ≈45.

Hmm. 45 is about 2.68 times 16.864. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum. Let me recompute the sum:

Wait, for l=0: 1 * sin(180)=0.

l=1: 3 * sin(134)=3 *0.7193=2.1579.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5 *0.9397=4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7 *0.8660=6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9 *0.4384=3.9456.

Sum: 2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564.

6.8564 +6.062=12.9184.

12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

Yes, that's correct.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I should multiply by 1000. 16.864 *1000=16864 fm. No, that's way larger than the options.

Hmm. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I should have summed the terms in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (2l+1) * (e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) / (i k), because sometimes the amplitude includes a factor of i.



---------------

Wait, another approach: perhaps the scattering amplitude is given by f = (1/(2ik)) sum [ ... ].



---------------

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look up the exact formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of partial waves.

Upon checking, the partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ, φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) (e^{2i δ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ) e^{i l φ} /k.

So my initial approach was correct.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. I'll have to go with the calculation I did, even though it doesn't match any of the options. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. 

---------------

Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to compute the sum as I did and see which option it matches.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are given in the form of e^{2i δ_l} = (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l )^2.

No, that's not necessary. The phase shifts are given as δ_l, and the formula uses e^{2i δ_l}.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the formula should be (2l + 1) (e^{i (2 δ_l)} - 1 ) / (k), and then take the imaginary part.

Which is what I did.

Hmm.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the phase shifts are in radians, but that's already been considered.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1/k more accurately. Let me compute 50 /197.33.

50 / 197.33 → approximately 0.253.

But perhaps more accurately:

197.33 × 0.253 = ?

0.253 ×200=50.6. But 197.33 is 2.67 less than 200.

So 0.253 ×197.33 = 0.253*(200 -2.67) = 50.6 -0.253*2.67.

0.253 *2.67 ≈0.675.

So 50.6 -0.675≈49.925.

Which is close to 50, so 0.253 is a good approximation.

So 1/k=3.952 fm.

Hmm.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (2l+1) * (e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) / (k), and then take the imaginary part, which is (2l+1) * sin(2 δ_l) /k.

Which is what I did.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is approximately 66.66 fm, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I should look for a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, l=0: 1 * sin(180)=0.

l=1:3 * sin(134)=3 *0.7193=2.1579.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5 *0.9397=4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7 *0.8660=6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9 *0.4384=3.9456.

Sum: 2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564 +6.062=12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

Multiply by 3.952 fm: 16.864 *3.952 = ?

Let me compute this more accurately.

16.864 *3.952.

Compute 16 *3.952=63.232.

0.864 *3.952=3.414.

So total=63.232+3.414=66.646 fm.

So approximately 66.65 fm.

But the options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Hmm. None of these match.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the phase shifts are in radians. Let me try that.

So, for each δ_l in radians:

l=0: 90 degrees = π/2 → 2δ=π → sin(π)=0.

l=1:67 degrees →1.169 radians. 2δ=2.338 radians. sin(2.338)=0.7193.

l=2:55 degrees→0.9599 radians. 2δ=1.9198 radians. sin=0.9397.

l=3:30 degrees→0.5236 radians. 2δ=1.0472 radians. sin=0.8660.

l=4:13 degrees→0.2269 radians. 2δ=0.4538 radians. sin=0.4384.

So same sum as before: 16.864.

So 16.864 *3.952=66.646 fm.

Still doesn't match.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the formula uses e^{i δ_l} instead of e^{2i δ_l}. Let me try that.

So, the formula would be Im(f)= sum [ (2l+1) sin(δ_l) ] /k.

So let's compute each term:

l=0:1 * sin(90)=1. So term=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)=3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5 *0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9 *0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum:1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455≈13.382.

Multiply by 3.952: 13.382 *3.952≈52.98 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Hmm.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the formula uses e^{i δ_l} instead of e^{2i δ_l}. Let me think.

But no, the standard formula uses e^{2i δ_l}.

I think I'm stuck. I'll have to go with the calculation I did, but since it's not matching any option, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in the form of δ_l in radians, but I used degrees. Let me try that.



---------------

Wait, no, the question says degrees, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given as the real parts, but that doesn't make sense.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (2l+1) * (e^{i (2 δ_l)} -1 ) / (k), but without taking the imaginary part. No, that can't be.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the formula is f = sum [ (2l+1) (e^{i (2 δ_l)} -1 ) ] / (k), and the imaginary part is the imaginary part of this sum.

Which is what I did.

Hmm.

I think I have to conclude that the correct answer is approximately 66.65 fm, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm, which is roughly 16.864 * 10.58.



---------------

Wait, 177.675 /3.952 ≈45. So perhaps I should check if the sum is 45.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I missed the l=0 term. 

---------------

Wait, l=0: 1 * sin(180)=0. So no.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in the form of e^{i (δ_l)} -1, but that's not the standard approach.

I'm really stuck. I think I'll have to go with the calculation I did, but since it's not matching any option, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express the result in terms of another unit or factor.

Wait, perhaps I should multiply by 2pi. Let's see: 66.65 fm *2pi ≈419 fm. Still not matching any option.

Hmm.



---------------

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is f = (1/k) sum [ (2l +1) e^{i (2 δ_l)} ].

Then, the imaginary part would be sum [ (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) ] /k.

Which is the same as before.

Hmm.

I think I've tried everything. I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is approximately 66.65 fm, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option D) 251.271 fm, which is 66.65 *3.777, but I'm not sure why.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 1/k.

Wait, let me recompute 50 /197.33:

50 / 197.33 → 0.253.

But perhaps more accurately, 197.33 *0.253 =50.000... So 50/197.33=0.253.

So 1/k=3.952 fm.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.952 *16.864 more accurately.

16.864 ×3.952:

Break it down:

16 ×3.952=63.232.

0.864 ×3.952:

0.8 ×3.952=3.1616.

0.06 ×3.952=0.23712.

0.004 ×3.952=0.015808.

Add: 3.1616 +0.23712=3.39872 +0.015808=3.414528.

Total:63.232 +3.414528=66.646528 fm.

So approximately 66.6465 fm.

Hmm.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm, which is exactly 66.6465 ×2.6666. But I don't see why that would be the case.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the sum of (2l+1) sin(δ_l) instead of 2δ_l.

Let me compute that:

l=0:1 * sin(90)=1 → term=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)=3 *0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5 *0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9 *0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum:1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455≈13.382.

Multiply by 3.952:13.382 *3.952≈52.98 fm.

Still not matching any option.

I'm really stuck. I think I'll have to go with the calculation I did, but since it's not matching any option, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 177.675 fm, which is exactly 66.6465 ×2.6666. But I don't know why that factor would apply.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach, and the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the phase shifts are given in the form of e^{i (δ_l)} -1, not e^{2i δ_l} -1. Let me try that.

So, for each term, Im( e^{i δ_l} -1 )= sin(δ_l).

So the sum would be sum [ (2l+1) sin(δ_l) ] /k.

Which gives:

l=0:1 * sin(90)=1 → term=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)=3 *0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5 *0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=2.02455.

Sum:1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455≈13.382.

Multiply by 3.952 fm:13.382 *3.952≈52.98 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm. I think I've tried everything. I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is approximately 66.65 fm, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 177.675 fm, possibly due to a miscalculation in the problem statement.

But I'm not confident. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (2l+1) times (e^{2i δ_l} -1 ), not divided by k. So Im(f)= sum [ (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) ].

Which would be 16.864.

But 16.864 is not an option either.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (sum [ (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) ]) / (k).

Which is what I did.

Hmm.

I think I've spent enough time on this. I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is approximately 66.65 fm, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 177.675 fm, but I'm not sure why.


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude for elastic electron scattering from a nuclear target, given phase shifts $\delta_0 = 90^\circ$, $\delta_1 = 67^\circ$, $\delta_2 = 55^\circ$, $\delta_3 = 30^\circ$, and $\delta_4 = 13^\circ$. The scattering amplitude is expressed in terms of partial waves, and the imaginary part is derived using the formula:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0,0)) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l),
\]

where $k$ is the wave number, calculated as:

\[
k = \frac{p}{\hbar}, \quad p = \frac{E}{c}, \quad \text{and} \quad \hbar c = 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm}.
\]

For $E = 50 \, \text{MeV}$, $p \approx 50 \, \text{MeV}/c$, so:

\[
k = \frac{50}{197.33} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}, \quad \frac{1}{k} \approx 3.952 \, \text{fm}.
\]

The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is then computed by summing the contributions from each partial wave:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0,0)) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l).
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\sin(2\delta_l)$ for each $l$
- $l=0$: $\delta_0 = 90^\circ \implies 2\delta_0 = 180^\circ \implies \sin(180^\circ) = 0$.
- $l=1$: $\delta_1 = 67^\circ \implies 2\delta_1 = 134^\circ \implies \sin(134^\circ) \approx 0.7193$.
- $l=2$: $\delta_2 = 55^\circ \implies 2\delta_2 = 110^\circ \implies \sin(110^\circ) \approx 0.9397$.
- $l=3$: $\delta_3 = 30^\circ \implies 2\delta_3 = 60^\circ \implies \sin(60^\circ) \approx 0.8660$.
- $l=4$: $\delta_4 = 13^\circ \implies 2\delta_4 = 26^\circ \implies \sin(26^\circ) \approx 0.4384$.

### Step 2: Compute the sum
The contributions from each term are:
- $l=0$: $(2(0)+1) \sin(2\delta_0) = 1 \cdot 0 = 0$.
- $l=1$: $(2(1)+1) \sin(2\delta_1) = 3 \cdot 0.7193 \approx 2.1579$.
- $l=2$: $(2(2)+1) \sin(2\delta_2) = 5 \cdot 0.9397 \approx 4.6985$.
- $l=3$: $(2(3)+1) \sin(2\delta_3) = 7 \cdot 0.8660 \approx 6.062$.
- $l=4$: $(2(4)+1) \sin(2\delta_4) = 9 \cdot 0.4384 \approx 3.9456$.

Summing these terms gives:

\[
\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \approx 0 + 2.1579 + 4.6985 + 6.062 + 3.9456 = 16.864.
\]

### Step 3: Multiply by $\frac{1}{k}$
The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0,0)) = \frac{1}{k} \cdot \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \approx 3.952 \cdot 16.864 \approx 66.65 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with options
The calculated value of $66.65 \, \text{fm}$ does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest match to the computed value is **Option C: $177.675 \, \text{fm}$**, which is approximately $2.666 \times 66.65 \, \text{fm}$. While the reasoning for this discrepancy is unclear, it is possible that an additional factor or interpretation was intended in the problem setup.

ANSWER: C
