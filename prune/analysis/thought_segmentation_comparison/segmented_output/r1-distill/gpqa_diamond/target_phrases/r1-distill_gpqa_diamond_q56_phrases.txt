Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons, and I'm supposed to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, elastic scattering... I remember that in such processes, electrons scatter off nuclei, and their paths are deflected. The phase shifts are given, and I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.



---------------

Wait, the question gives me several phase shifts: δ₀ is 90 degrees, δ₁ is 67, δ₂ is 55, δ₃ is 30, and δ₄ is 13 degrees. Oh, and I'm supposed to ignore the rest beyond δ₄. So I guess that means I'll only consider up to l=4, where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number.

I think the scattering amplitude f(θ) for electrons involves the sum over these phase shifts. The formula I remember is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum over l [ ( (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) ) * ( (2l +1)/(l(l+1)) ) * ( (sin θ)^{2l} ) ) ] multiplied by some other factors. 

---------------

Wait, wait, maybe the imaginary part is just the imaginary component of each term in this sum. Oh right, because the amplitude f has a real and imaginary part. Since the question asks for the imaginary part along the beam direction, which is θ=0 degrees. 

---------------

Oh wait, but wait: when θ is 0, sinθ is zero, so (sinθ)^{2l} would be zero except when l=0. Because any higher l would make that term zero.

So when θ is 0, the only non-zero term in the sum is for l=0. Because for l=0, (sinθ)^{0} is 1. So all other terms (l=1,2,3,4) would contribute nothing because sin0 is zero to any positive power. That simplifies things a lot.

So the imaginary part of f(0) would only come from the l=0 term. Let me think about the formula again. The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum [ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * ( (2l+1)/(l(l+1)) ) * (sinθ)^{2l} ) ]



---------------

But wait, for θ=0, sinθ is zero, so only l=0 term remains.

So for l=0, the term becomes (e^{2iδ₀} -1) * ( (2*0 +1)/(0*(0+1)) ) * 1. 

---------------

Wait, but wait, 0*(0+1) is 0, so that's a division by zero. Oh, right! Because for l=0, the formula is a bit different. Because when l=0, the denominator becomes zero, but the numerator is 1. So perhaps that term is handled separately.



---------------

Wait, I think for l=0, the term is just (e^{2iδ₀} - 1), multiplied by 1/(2ik). Because the general formula for the amplitude is:

f(θ) = [ (e^{2iδ₀} - 1) ] / (2ik) + sum_{l=1}^∞ [ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) * (2l +1) * (sinθ)^{2l} ) ] / [ l(l+1) * (2ik) ) ]

So for θ=0, the sum from l=1 onwards is zero because of the (sinθ)^{2l} factor. So f(0) is just (e^{2iδ₀} -1)/(2ik).



---------------

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the imaginary part of f along the beam direction, which is f(θ=0) but only the imaginary component.

So let's compute Im[f(0)]. So f(0) = [e^{2i δ₀} - 1 ] / (2ik)

First, compute e^{2i δ₀}. Since δ₀ is 90 degrees, which is π/2 radians. So 2δ₀ is π radians. So e^{iπ} is -1. So e^{2i δ₀} is e^{i π} = -1.

So [e^{2i δ₀} -1] = (-1) -1 = -2.

So f(0) = (-2)/(2ik) = (-1)/(ik)

Now, the imaginary part of f(0) is the coefficient of i in the expression when written in terms of real and imaginary parts. Let's express 1/(ik) in terms of real and imaginary components.



---------------

Wait, 1/(ik) can be written as (1/i) * (1/k) = ( -i ) * (1/k ), since 1/i = -i.

So 1/(ik) = -i/(k). So f(0) = (-1) * (-i)/(k) ) = i/(k)

So f(0) = i/(k)

The imaginary part is the coefficient of i, which is 1/k.



---------------

Wait, but I'm supposed to compute the imaginary part. So Im[f(0)] = 1/k.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the units here. The problem states that the energy is 50 MeV. 

---------------

Wait, but what is k? The wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/(ħ). 

---------------

But wait, E is the kinetic energy. So let me compute k.

Wait, the energy E is 50 MeV. Electrons have a rest mass of about 0.511 MeV/c². So when E is much larger than the rest mass, we can approximate E ≈ (ħ²k²)/(2m). So k ≈ sqrt(2mE)/ħ.



---------------

Wait, m is the mass of the electron, which is 9.10938356 × 10^-31 kg. Let me compute k.



---------------

But wait, perhaps it's easier to compute k in atomic units or using some standard formula.

Wait, but in natural units where ħ = c = 1, but perhaps I should use the formula for k in terms of the energy.



---------------

Wait, the kinetic energy E is 50 MeV. The rest mass energy of the electron is m c² = 0.511 MeV. So E is much larger than m c², so relativistic effects are important, but perhaps for the purpose of this problem, we can approximate using the non-relativistic formula.



---------------

Wait, but the non-relativistic formula is k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

Wait, let's compute E in Joules. 1 eV is 1.60218 × 10^-19 J. So 50 MeV is 50 × 10^6 eV = 5e7 eV.

E = 5e7 eV * 1.60218e-19 J/eV = 8.0109e-12 J.

m is 9.10938356e-31 kg.

So k = sqrt(2mE) / ħ.



---------------

Wait, ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So compute numerator: sqrt(2 * 9.10938356e-31 kg * 8.0109e-12 J )

Compute 2mE: 2 * 9.10938e-31 * 8.0109e-12 = ?

9.10938e-31 *8.0109e-12 = approx 7.298e-42 kg·J.



---------------

Wait, 2 * 7.298e-42 = 1.4596e-41.

sqrt(1.4596e-41) = sqrt(1.4596) * 1e-20.5 ≈ 1.208e-20.5. 

---------------

Wait, 1e-41 is (1e-20.5)^2. So sqrt(1.4596e-41) ≈ 1.208e-20.5 m^-1? 

---------------

Wait, no, sqrt(kg·J) is kg^0.5 * J^0.5. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.



---------------

Wait, J is kg·m²/s². So 2mE has units kg * kg·m²/s² = kg²·m²/s². So sqrt(2mE) is kg·m/s. So when you divide by ħ (J·s), which is kg·m²/s, then k has units 1/m.



---------------

Wait, let's proceed numerically.

Compute sqrt(2 * m * E) = sqrt(2 * 9.10938e-31 kg * 8.0109e-12 J )

So 2 *9.10938e-31 = 1.821876e-30 kg.

Multiply by 8.0109e-12 J: 1.821876e-30 *8.0109e-12 = 1.460e-41 kg·J.



---------------

Wait, but J is kg·m²/s², so kg·J is kg^2·m²/s².

So sqrt(1.46e-41 kg²·m²/s²) = sqrt(1.46e-41) kg·m/s.

sqrt(1.46e-41) = approx 3.82e-21 kg·m/s.

So sqrt(2mE) = 3.82e-21 kg·m/s.

Divide by ħ (1.05457e-34 J·s = 1.05457e-34 kg·m²/s).

So k = (3.82e-21 kg·m/s) / (1.05457e-34 kg·m²/s) ) 



---------------

Wait, let's compute that: numerator is 3.82e-21, denominator is 1.05457e-34.

Dividing gives (3.82e-21)/(1.05457e-34) ) ≈ (3.82 /1.05457 ) * 1e13 ≈ 3.62 *1e13 m^-1.



---------------

Wait, 3.62e13 m^-1 is a very large k. Wait, but 50 MeV is a high energy, so high k makes sense.



---------------

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, another approach: I can use the relation k = (sqrt(2mE)) / ħ.

But E is in Joules.

E = 50 MeV = 50e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 = 8.01e-12 J.

m is 9.109e-31 kg.

So sqrt(2mE) = sqrt(2 * 9.109e-31 * 8.01e-12 )

Calculate 2 *9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30.

1.8218e-30 *8.01e-12 = 1.8218e-30 *8.01e-12 = (1.8218 *8.01) e-42 = approx 14.596e-42 = 1.4596e-41.

sqrt(1.4596e-41) = sqrt(1.4596) * 1e-20.5 = approx 1.208 * 1e-20.5. Since 1e-20.5 is sqrt(1e-41), which is 1e-20.5. So sqrt(1.4596e-41) ≈ 1.208e-20.5 m^-0.5?



---------------

Wait, maybe I'm getting the exponents wrong. Let me compute sqrt(1e-41) as 1e-20.5. So sqrt(1.4596e-41) = sqrt(1.4596) * 1e-20.5 = 1.208 * 1e-20.5 = 1.208e-20.5.

But 1e-20.5 is 3.16e-21. So 1.208 *3.16e-21 ≈ 3.815e-21 m^-0.5?



---------------

Wait, no, wait. The units of sqrt(2mE) are sqrt( kg * J ), and J is kg m²/s². So sqrt( kg * kg m²/s² ) = sqrt(kg² m²/s² ) = kg m / s. So the units are kg m/s.

Then, when you divide by ħ (which is kg m²/s), you get (kg m/s) / (kg m²/s) ) = 1/(m), so units of k are 1/m. So yeah, the calculation gives k ≈ 3.62e13 m^-1.



---------------

Wait, but 3.62e13 m^-1 is 3.62e13 per meter, which is 3.62e19 per femtometer (since 1 m = 1e15 fm). Because 1 fm is 1e-15 m. So 1/m is 1e15 fm^-1. So 3.62e13 m^-1 = 3.62e13 * 1e15 fm^-1 = 3.62e28 fm^-1? That can't be right because the options are in the order of 1e5 fm. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Let me recompute:

sqrt(2mE) = sqrt(2 * 9.10938e-31 kg * 8.01e-12 J )

= sqrt( 2 * 9.10938e-31 * 8.01e-12 ) 

Compute 2 *9.10938e-31 = 1.821876e-30.

Multiply by 8.01e-12: 1.821876e-30 *8.01e-12 = 1.821876 *8.01 = approx 14.6, and exponents: e-30 *e-12 = e-42.

So 14.6e-42 = 1.46e-41.

sqrt(1.46e-41) = sqrt(1.46) * sqrt(1e-41) ≈ 1.208 * 1e-20.5.

But 1e-20.5 is approximately 3.16e-21. So 1.208 *3.16e-21 = approx 3.81e-21.

So sqrt(2mE) ≈ 3.81e-21 kg·m/s.

Now, ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s, which is 1.0545718e-34 kg·m²/s.

So k = (3.81e-21 kg·m/s ) / (1.0545718e-34 kg·m²/s )

Dividing these, the kg cancels, m/s divided by m²/s is 1/m.

So (3.81e-21) / (1.0545718e-34) ) = (3.81 / 1.0545718) ) * 1e13.

3.81 / 1.0545718 ≈ 3.61.

So k ≈ 3.61e13 m^-1.



---------------

Wait, but 3.61e13 m^-1 is 3.61e13 / (1e15 fm) ) because 1 m = 1e15 fm. So 3.61e13 /1e15 = 3.61e-2 fm^-1. 

---------------

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the options are in the order of 1e5 fm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units somewhere. Let me think again.



---------------

Wait, maybe I should compute k in terms of inverse femtometers because the options are given in fm. So 1 fm is 1e-15 meters. So 1 m is 1e15 fm. So 1 m^-1 is 1e-15 fm^-1.

So 3.61e13 m^-1 = 3.61e13 * 1e-15 fm^-1 = 3.61e-2 fm^-1.



---------------

Wait, that's 0.0361 fm^-1. But that's a very small number. Hmm, but that can't be right because the options are on the order of 1e5 fm. So maybe I did something wrong.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I should have used the relativistic formula for k. Because 50 MeV is much larger than the rest mass energy of the electron (0.511 MeV), so the non-relativistic formula isn't accurate. Let me try using the relativistic energy relation.

The relativistic energy is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) - m c^2. But perhaps for high energies, E ≈ pc. So p ≈ E/c.



---------------

Wait, but for electrons, the momentum p is given by sqrt(2 m E) when E is much larger than m c^2, but maybe the relativistic approach would give a better approximation.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation k = p/ħ, where p is the momentum.

If E is much larger than m c², then E ≈ pc, so p ≈ E/(c).



---------------

Wait, let me compute p = E/(c), and then k = p/ħ.

E is 50 MeV. Let me convert E into Joules again.

E = 50e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 8.01e-12 J.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So p = E/(c) = 8.01e-12 J / 3e8 m/s.

J is kg·m²/s², so J/(m/s) )= kg·m/s. So p = (8.01e-12) / (3e8) ) kg·m/s.

= 2.67e-20 kg·m/s.

Then, k = p/ħ = (2.67e-20 kg·m/s) / (1.0545718e-34 J·s )



---------------

Wait, J·s is kg·m²/s, so (kg·m/s) / (kg·m²/s) ) = 1/m.

So (2.67e-20) / (1.0545718e-34) ) = 2.53e14 m^-1.

Convert m^-1 to fm^-1: 1 m^-1 = 1e15 fm^-1. So 2.53e14 m^-1 = 2.53e14 * 1e15 fm^-1 = 2.53e29 fm^-1. 

---------------

Wait, that's even worse. Hmm, but that can't be right because the options are in the hundreds of fm. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.



---------------

Wait, maybe I should use the relation between the scattering amplitude and the phase shifts. Since the imaginary part of f(0) is 1/(k), but wait, no, earlier I found f(0) = i/(k), so Im[f(0)] is 1/k.



---------------

Wait, but in the calculation, k was 3.6e13 m^-1, which is 3.6e13 per meter, which is 3.6e13 * 1e-15 fm^-1 = 3.6e-2 fm^-1. So 1/k is 1/(3.6e-2 fm^-1) ) = (1/0.036 ) fm ≈ 27.78 fm.

But the options are in the hundreds of fm. So that's not matching any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the scattering amplitude.



---------------

Wait, maybe I should double-check the formula for the scattering amplitude. I'm a bit confused about the exact expression. Let me recall.

The scattering amplitude f(θ) for spinless particles is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) ) * (2l + 1) * (sin θ)^{2l} ) / ( l (l+1) )

But when θ=0, sinθ is zero, so all terms with l≥1 vanish, and only l=0 remains. For l=0, the denominator is 0, but the term is taken as a limit. So the l=0 term becomes (e^{2iδ_0} -1 ) / (2ik).



---------------

Wait, that's correct. So for l=0, the term is (e^{2iδ_0} -1) / (2ik).

So then f(0) = (e^{2i δ_0} -1) / (2ik )

As I computed earlier, when δ₀ is 90 degrees, e^{2i δ₀} is e^{i π} = -1. So [ -1 -1 ] = -2.

So f(0) = (-2)/(2ik) = -1/(ik).

Which is the same as i/(k), because 1/(ik) = -i/(k^2) ? 

---------------

Wait, no. Wait, 1/(ik) can be written as (1/i) * (1/k) ) = (-i) * (1/k).



---------------

Wait, 1/i = -i, because i*(-i) = 1.

So 1/(ik) = (1/k) * (1/i) )= (1/k)* (-i) ) = -i/(k).

So f(0) = (-1) * (-i/(k) ) = i/(k).

So the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/k ), because i/(k) = 0 + i*(1/k), so Im[f(0)] = 1/k.



---------------

Wait, but then 1/k is in units of fm, because k is 1/fm. Wait, no, because earlier I calculated k as 3.6e13 m^-1, which is 3.6e13 per meter, which is 3.6e13 * 1e-15 per femtometer, which is 3.6e-2 per femtometer, so 1/k is (1/(3.6e-2 per fm )) ) = (1/(3.6e-2 )) fm ≈ 27.78 fm.

But the options are much larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation between the scattering amplitude and the cross-section, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Maybe the imaginary part of f is related to the total cross-section. The total cross-section σ_total is given by 4π |f|^2, but wait, no, that's for the differential cross-section.



---------------

Wait, but the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 might have a physical meaning, such as the total absorption or something else, but I'm not sure.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is different. Wait, perhaps the formula is f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) ) * ( (2l+1)/(2l(l+1)) ) * (sin θ)^{2l} )



---------------

Wait, that might be the case. Because I've seen different forms of the scattering amplitude, sometimes with a factor of (2l+1)/(2l(l+1)).



---------------

Wait, let me recheck. The general form is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l} (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) (sinθ)^{2l} / ( l (l+1) ) )

Hmm, but I'm not entirely certain. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l} ( (e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) ( (2l+1)/(2l(l+1)) ) ) (sinθ)^{2l} )

So if that's the case, then for θ=0, only l=0 term remains.

So for l=0, (sinθ)^{0}=1, and (2l+1)/(2l(l+1)) ) becomes 1/(0*(1)) ), which is undefined. So perhaps that formula is not correct for l=0.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the correct expression is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (e^{2iδ_l} -1) ) * ( (2l+1)/(l(l+1)) ) ) (sinθ)^{2l} )

But for l=0, this becomes (e^{2iδ_0} -1) * (1/(0*(1)) ), which is undefined. So perhaps the l=0 term is treated separately.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the correct expression is f(θ) = (e^{2iδ_0} -1)/(2ik) + sum_{l=1}^∞ [ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) (sinθ)^{2l} ] / [ 2k l (l+1) ) ]

In that case, for θ=0, only the l=0 term remains.

So f(0) = (e^{2iδ_0} -1)/(2ik )

Which brings us back to the same conclusion as before.

So Im[f(0)] = 1/k.

But earlier, my calculation of k gave me Im[f(0)] ≈ 27.78 fm, but the options are much larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I should use a different approach to compute k. Let me think about the relation between the energy and the wavelength.

The electron's energy is 50 MeV. The De Broglie wavelength λ is given by λ = h / p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum.

But since E = p²/(2m) (non-relativistic approximation), so p = sqrt(2 m E ), and λ = h / p = h / sqrt(2 m E )

h is Planck's constant, 6.62607015e-34 J·s.

m is 9.10938356e-31 kg.

E is 50 MeV = 50e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 8.01e-12 J.

So p = sqrt(2 * 9.10938e-31 kg * 8.01e-12 J ) = sqrt( 2 * 9.10938e-31 *8.01e-12 )

Compute 2 *9.10938e-31 = 1.821876e-30.

Multiply by 8.01e-12: 1.821876e-30 *8.01e-12 = 1.4596e-41.

sqrt(1.4596e-41) = approx 3.82e-21 kg·m/s.

So p = 3.82e-21 kg·m/s.

Then λ = h / p = 6.626e-34 / 3.82e-21 = approx 1.734e-13 meters.

Which is 1.734e-13 m = 173.4 fm.

So k = 2π / λ = 2π / (1.734e-13 m) ≈ 3.64e13 m^-1.



---------------

Wait, that's consistent with the earlier calculation. So 1/k = 1/(3.64e13 m^-1 ) = 2.747e-14 meters.

Convert meters to femtometers: 1 m = 1e15 fm. So 2.747e-14 m = 2.747e-14 * 1e15 fm = 27.47 fm.

But the options are in the range of hundreds of fm. So I'm getting 27 fm, but the closest option is C) 177.675 fm, which is about 6.5 times larger. Hmm, but that's not matching.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts include other terms beyond l=4, but the problem says to ignore the rest beyond δ₄. So I'm only considering up to l=4. But for θ=0, only l=0 contributes. So the phase shifts beyond l=0 don't affect the result.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the imaginary part of the amplitude in terms of the imaginary unit times some factor. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for f(0). Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by the optical theorem, which relates the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude to the total cross-section. The optical theorem says that Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) * σ_total.

But I don't know the total cross-section here. But perhaps the scattering amplitude's imaginary part can be calculated using the given phase shifts.



---------------

Wait, but earlier we determined that for θ=0, only the l=0 phase shift contributes. So the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/k) because f(0) = i/(k).

But according to the calculation, that's about 27 fm, but none of the options match this. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I should re-express k in terms of energy in a different way. Let's try using the relation k = (sqrt(2mE)) / ħ.

E =50 MeV =50e6 eV.

But 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So E=50e6 *1.602e-19 =8.01e-12 J.

m=9.10938356e-31 kg.

So sqrt(2mE)=sqrt(2*9.10938356e-31 *8.01e-12 )=sqrt(1.4596e-41)=3.82e-21 kg m/s.

k=3.82e-21/(1.0545718e-34 )=3.62e13 m^-1.

So 1/k=2.76e-14 m=27.6 fm.



---------------

Wait, but the options are way larger. So perhaps the mistake is in the initial assumption. Maybe the formula for the imaginary part is different.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is different. I've heard that for spin-½ particles, the scattering amplitude involves more terms, but the problem states that it's about electrons, which are spin-½. But perhaps in this problem, we're treating them as spinless for simplicity.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part of f(θ) is given by the sum of the phase shifts. Wait, but that doesn't sound right.



---------------

Wait, another thought: The scattering amplitude's imaginary part at θ=0 is given by (1/k) sum ( sin(2δ_l) ), but I'm not sure. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps it's the sum of sin(δ_l) for each l.

Wait, but earlier I thought that only l=0 contributes, so the sum would be sin(δ_0). But δ_0 is 90 degrees, sin(90) is 1. So (1/k) *1= 27.6 fm.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.



---------------

Wait, maybe the formula for the imaginary part of f(θ) is (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ sin(2δ_l) * ( (2l+1)/(2l(l+1)) ) * (sinθ)^{2l} )



---------------

Wait, but again, for θ=0, only l=0 would contribute, giving (1/k) sin(2δ_0) * (1/(0*1)) ), which is undefined. So that can't be right.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ sin(2δ_l) * (2l+1)/(l(l+1)) )

But for l=0, that term is undefined. So perhaps it's only the sum from l=1.

But that can't be right because for θ=0, only l=0 contributes, so perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0)) = (1/k) sin(2δ_0).

Because, when l=0, the term is (e^{2iδ_0} -1 )/(2ik ), which is ( (cos(2δ_0) + i sin(2δ_0)) -1 )/(2ik )

Which simplifies to ( (cos(2δ_0) -1) + i sin(2δ_0) )/(2ik )

The imaginary part is [ sin(2δ_0) ]/(2k )

So Im(f(0)) = [ sin(2δ_0) ]/(2k )



---------------

Wait, earlier I thought it was 1/k, but perhaps it's [ sin(2δ_0) ]/(2k )

Ah, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because, let's compute f(0) again.

f(0) = (e^{2iδ_0} -1 )/(2ik )

Which is [ (cos(2δ_0) + i sin(2δ_0)) -1 ] / (2ik )

= [ (cos(2δ_0) -1) + i sin(2δ_0) ] / (2ik )

The imaginary part is [ sin(2δ_0) ] / (2k )

So Im(f(0)) = [ sin(2δ_0) ] / (2k )

Ah! So I missed a factor of 2 earlier. So the correct expression is Im(f(0)) = sin(2δ_0)/(2k )

So now, let's compute this.

δ_0 is 90 degrees. So 2δ_0 is 180 degrees.

sin(180 degrees) is 0. So Im(f(0)) would be zero. But that's not possible because the options don't include zero.



---------------

Wait, this can't be right because in the earlier approach, we found Im(f(0)) = 1/k, but with the correct analysis, it's sin(2δ_0)/(2k )



---------------

Wait, so when δ_0 is 90 degrees, 2δ_0 is 180 degrees, sin(180)=0. So the imaginary part is zero. But that's not matching the options.

Hmm, this is confusing. I must have made a mistake in the approach.



---------------

Alternative approach: Maybe the correct formula for the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (sin δ_l) ) * ( (2l+1)/(2l(l+1)) ) )

But for θ=0, only l=0 contributes, which is undefined. So perhaps this isn't the right formula.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ sin(2δ_l) * ( (2l+1)/(l(l+1)) ) )

But for l=0, this would be sin(2δ_0) * (1/(0*1)) ), which is undefined. So perhaps the correct formula is only for l≥1.

But then, for θ=0, the sum would be zero because (sinθ)^{2l} is zero. So I'm stuck.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact formula for the scattering amplitude in elastic scattering. From what I recall, the scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) ) * ( (2l +1)/(l(l+1)) ) ) (sinθ)^{2l} )

So for θ=0, only l=0 term remains. But for l=0, (2l+1)/(l(l+1)) ) is 1/(0*1) which is infinity. So perhaps the l=0 term is treated separately.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the correct expression for l=0 is f(0) = (e^{2iδ_0} - 1 )/(2ik )

Which is the same as earlier.

So f(0) = (e^{i π} -1 )/(2ik ) = (-1 -1 )/(2ik ) = (-2)/(2ik ) = (-1)/(ik )

Which is (i)/(k ), because 1/(ik ) = -i/(k^2 )? 

---------------

Wait, no, 1/(ik) = (1/i) * (1/k ) = (-i) * (1/k )

So f(0) = (-1) * ( -i/k ) ) = i/(k )

So Im(f(0)) = 1/k.

Earlier, I computed 1/k as approximately 27.6 fm.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of k.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I should compute k using the relativistic relation. Let me try that.

The relativistic energy is E = gamma m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma = E/(m c² ). For E =50 MeV, m c²=0.511 MeV. So gamma =50 / 0.511 ≈97.8.

The momentum p is gamma m v, where v is the velocity. For relativistic speeds, v ≈ c. So p ≈ gamma m c.

m c is 9.10938e-31 kg *3e8 m/s =2.7328e-22 kg·m/s.

p ≈ gamma * m c =97.8 * 2.7328e-22 ≈2.672e-20 kg·m/s.

k = p/ħ =2.672e-20 /1.05457e-34 ≈2.534e14 m^-1.

So 1/k =3.95e-15 meters =39.5 fm.

Hmm, that's about 39.5 fm, which is closer to option C (177.675 fm) but still not matching.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I should compute k in terms of the Compton wavelength.

The Compton wavelength λ_c = h/(m c) = (6.626e-34 J·s)/(9.109e-31 kg *3e8 m/s )= (6.626e-34)/(2.7327e-22 )=2.426e-12 m=24.26 fm.

So k = 2π/λ = 2π/(24.26e-15 m )=2.58e13 m^-1.

Then 1/k=3.88e-14 m=38.8 fm.

Still not matching any options.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the problem is asking for the scattering amplitude's imaginary part multiplied by some factor. For example, maybe it's Im(f) multiplied by 4π.



---------------

Wait, the differential cross-section is |f(θ)|^2, but the problem is about the scattering amplitude, not the cross-section.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the imaginary part in units of inverse femtometers, but when I calculated 1/k, I got 27.6 fm, which is 27.6 fm⁻¹? No, that's not right.



---------------

Wait, no, 1/k is in meters, which is 27.6 fm. So if Im(f(0)) = 1/k, then it's 27.6 fm.

But the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for Im(f(0)) is sum_{l=0}^∞ [ sin(δ_l) * (2l+1)/(2l(l+1)) ) ]

But for θ=0, only l=0 contributes, which would be [ sin(δ_0) * (1) ]/(0*1*2 ), which is undefined. So that's not possible.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0)) = sum_{l=0}^∞ [ sin(2δ_l) * (2l+1)/(2l(l+1)) ) ] * (1/k )

But for l=0, that would be sin(180) which is zero, so no contribution. Then, the sum starts from l=1. But for θ=0, other terms vanish, so this approach doesn't work.

I'm stuck. Let me try to look for another approach. Perhaps the given phase shifts are for partial waves, and I need to sum them up in some way.



---------------

Wait, but for θ=0, only l=0 contributes, so the sum is just l=0. So the imaginary part is [ sin(2δ_0) ]/(2k )

But δ_0 is 90 degrees, so sin(180) is zero. So Im(f(0)) is zero. But the options don't include zero. So that can't be right.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the formula is Im(f) = sum [ ( sin(δ_l) ) * ( (2l+1)/(2l(l+1)) ) ) ] * (1/k )

But then for l=0, (2l+1)/(2l(l+1)) ) is (1)/(0*1*2 )= undefined. So that can't be.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum [ ( sin(δ_l) ) * ( (2l+1)/(l(l+1)) ) ) ] * (1/(2k) )

For l=0, (2l+1)/(l(l+1)) )=1/(0*1)=infinite. So again, not possible.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for the answer in the options that matches 27.6 fm. But the options don't have that. The closest is option C) 177.675 fm, which is about 6.4 times larger.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me recheck the calculation.

E=50 MeV=50e6 eV *1.602e-19 J/eV=8.01e-12 J.

m=9.10938356e-31 kg.

k= sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

sqrt(2mE)=sqrt(2 *9.10938e-31 *8.01e-12 )=sqrt(1.4596e-41)=3.82e-21 kg·m/s.

k=3.82e-21 /1.05457e-34=3.62e13 m^-1.

1/k=2.76e-14 m=27.6 fm.

So I think the calculation is correct. So the answer should be approximately 27.6 fm, but none of the options match.



---------------

Wait, looking back at the question, the phase shifts are given as δ_0=90 degrees, δ_1=67, etc. But I only considered δ_0. So perhaps the problem expects the sum of the phase shifts, but no, for θ=0, only l=0 contributes.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe the imaginary part is the sum of the phase shifts multiplied by some factors.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ ( sin(δ_l) ) * (2l+1)/(2l(l+1)) )

But for l=0, this is (sin(90)) * (1) / (0) which is undefined. So no.



---------------

Another thought: Perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude in the optical model includes the real and imaginary parts as Re(f) = sum (e^{2iδ_l} -1 )/(2ik) and Im(f) = sum ( (2l+1)/(2k l(l+1)) ) * sin(2δ_l) * (sinθ)^{2l} )

But for θ=0, only l=0 term remains, which is undefined. So perhaps the formula is different.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the imaginary part of f(0) is given by (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ sin(2δ_l) * (2l+1)/(l(l+1)) )

But for l=0, this becomes sin(180)/something which is zero. So again, no contribution.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should go with the calculation I have, which gives approximately 27.6 fm, and see if any option is close. But the options don't have that.



---------------

Wait, looking at the options:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Hmm, option C is approximately 177.675 fm, which is about 6.4 times my calculated value. Could I have missed a factor of 2 somewhere?



---------------

Wait, in the formula for Im(f(0)), I have Im(f(0)) = [ sin(2δ_0) ]/(2k )

But for δ_0=90 degrees, sin(180)=0. So Im(f(0))=0. But that's not possible.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used δ_0=45 degrees, but no, the question states δ_0=90 degrees.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0)) = [ (e^{2iδ_0} -1 )/(2ik ) ] * i.



---------------

Wait, because f(0) = (e^{2iδ_0} -1 )/(2ik ), and the imaginary part is the coefficient of i.

Which would be [ (e^{2iδ_0} -1 )/(2ik ) ] = (cos(2δ_0) -1 + i sin(2δ_0) )/(2ik )

So the imaginary part is sin(2δ_0)/(2k )

Which for δ_0=90 degrees, sin(180)=0, so Im(f(0))=0.

But the options don't have zero. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is different. I found a reference that says the scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (e^{2iδ_l} -1) ) * (2l +1)/(l(l+1)) ) * (sinθ)^{2l}

So for θ=0, only l=0 term remains, which is (e^{2iδ_0} -1 )/(2ik )

So f(0)= (e^{2iδ_0} -1 )/(2ik )

Which is (cos(2δ_0) +i sin(2δ_0) -1 )/(2ik )

The imaginary part is [ sin(2δ_0) ]/(2k )

But δ_0=90 degrees, so sin(180)=0, Im(f(0))=0.

But this can't be right because the options don't have zero. So perhaps the mistake is that δ_0 is not 90 degrees, but perhaps it's given in another way.



---------------

Wait, the problem states δ_0=90 degrees, which is correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is zero, but it's not among the options. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the forward scattering direction but another angle, but the question says along the incident beam direction, which is θ=0.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the given phase shifts are not for the same l as I'm considering. For example, δ_0 is for l=0, δ_1 for l=1, etc. So in the sum, each term contributes to a different angular momentum state.

But for θ=0, only the l=0 term contributes. So I'm back to the same conclusion.



---------------

Another thought: Perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is different, and the imaginary part is the sum of the phase shifts multiplied by some factors.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/k) times the sum of all δ_l. But that would be (1/k) * sum δ_l, but that seems unlikely.

But let's try: sum δ_l from l=0 to 4: 90 +67 +55 +30 +13 = 255 degrees.

So (1/k)*255*(π/180) [convert degrees to radians] → 255*(0.01745) ≈4.44 radians.

But 1/k is 27.6 fm, so 27.6 *4.44 ≈121.3 fm.

Still not matching any options.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is (sum (sin δ_l )) * (1/k )

Sum sin δ_l: sin(90)=1, sin(67)=0.92, sin(55)=0.82, sin(30)=0.5, sin(13)=0.225.

Sum: 1+0.92=1.92, +0.82=2.74, +0.5=3.24, +0.225=3.465.

So 3.465 * (1/k )=3.465 *27.6 fm ≈95.4 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (1/(2k)) sum ( (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ) )

For l=0 to 4.

So compute for each l:

l=0: (1) * sin(180)=0.

l=1:3 * sin(134)=3*sin(134)=3*(0.6947)=2.084.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5*(0.9397)=4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7*(0.8660)=6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9*(0.4384)=3.9456.

Sum these: 0 +2.084 +4.6985 +6.062 +3.9456 ≈16.789.

Multiply by (1/(2k )) → 16.789/(2*3.62e13 m^-1 )=16.789/(7.24e13 )=2.316e-13 m=23.16 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm.



---------------

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (1/k) sum ( (2l+1) sin(δ_l) )

For l=0 to 4.

Compute each term:

l=0:1 * sin(90)=1*1=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)=3*0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5*0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9*0.22495≈2.0245.

Sum:1+2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.0245=13.382.

Multiply by (1/k )=27.6 fm → 13.382 *27.6 ≈368 fm.

But that's not an option either.

I think I'm stuck and not making progress. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options provided. My earlier calculation suggested approximately 27.6 fm, but that's not an option. The closest option is C) 177.675 fm, which is about 6.4 times larger. Perhaps I missed a factor of 2 or another factor somewhere. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the formula includes a factor of 2 from the spin, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for Im(f(0)) is (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ sin(δ_l) * (2l+1)/(2l(l+1)) )

But for l=0, this is undefined. So perhaps the sum starts from l=1.

Compute for l=1 to 4:

l=1: (3)/(2*1*2) )=3/(4)=0.75. sin(67)=0.9205. 0.75 *0.9205≈0.690.

l=2:5/(2*2*3)=5/12≈0.4167. sin(55)=0.8192. 0.4167 *0.8192≈0.340.

l=3:7/(2*3*4)=7/24≈0.2917. sin(30)=0.5. 0.2917 *0.5≈0.1458.

l=4:9/(2*4*5)=9/40=0.225. sin(13)=0.22495. 0.225 *0.22495≈0.0507.

Sum:0.690 +0.340=1.03 +0.1458=1.1758 +0.0507≈1.2265.

Multiply by (1/k )=27.6 fm → 1.2265 *27.6 ≈33.75 fm.

Still not matching any option.

At this point, I think I must have made a mistake in the approach, but I can't figure it out. I'll have to go with the initial calculation, which was approximately 27.6 fm, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm, which is exactly 6.44 times my calculated value. Maybe I missed a factor of 6.44 somewhere. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.


To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, we analyze the given phase shifts $\delta_0 = 90^\circ$, $\delta_1 = 67^\circ$, $\delta_2 = 55^\circ$, $\delta_3 = 30^\circ$, and $\delta_4 = 13^\circ$. The scattering amplitude $f(\theta)$ is expressed as:

\[
f(\theta) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^\infty \left( e^{2i\delta_l} - 1 \right) \frac{(2l+1)}{l(l+1)} (\sin\theta)^{2l}.
\]

For $\theta = 0$, only the $l=0$ term contributes because $(\sin\theta)^{2l} = 0$ for $l \geq 1$. The $l=0$ term simplifies to:

\[
f(0) = \frac{e^{2i\delta_0} - 1}{2ik}.
\]

Substituting $\delta_0 = 90^\circ$ (or $\pi/2$ radians), we compute $e^{2i\delta_0} = e^{i\pi} = -1$. Thus:

\[
f(0) = \frac{-1 - 1}{2ik} = \frac{-2}{2ik} = \frac{-1}{ik}.
\]

The imaginary part of $f(0)$ is:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{k}.
\]

To calculate $k$, we use the relation $k = \sqrt{2mE}/\hbar$, where $m$ is the electron mass ($9.10938356 \times 10^{-31}$ kg), $E = 50$ MeV ($8.01 \times 10^{-12}$ J), and $\hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}$ J·s. Substituting these values:

\[
k = \frac{\sqrt{2mE}}{\hbar} = \frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot 9.10938356 \times 10^{-31} \cdot 8.01 \times 10^{-12}}}{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}.
\]

First, compute $\sqrt{2mE}$:

\[
\sqrt{2mE} = \sqrt{2 \cdot 9.10938356 \times 10^{-31} \cdot 8.01 \times 10^{-12}} = \sqrt{1.4596 \times 10^{-41}} \approx 3.82 \times 10^{-21} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

Then, divide by $\hbar$:

\[
k = \frac{3.82 \times 10^{-21}}{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}} \approx 3.62 \times 10^{13} \, \text{m}^{-1}.
\]

Convert $k$ to inverse femtometers ($1 \, \text{m}^{-1} = 10^{15} \, \text{fm}^{-1}$):

\[
k \approx 3.62 \times 10^{13} \, \text{m}^{-1} = 3.62 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{k} \approx \frac{1}{3.62 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{fm}^{-1}} \approx 27.6 \, \text{fm}.
\]

This result does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is **C) 177.675 fm**, which is approximately $6.44$ times larger than the calculated value. This discrepancy suggests a possible missing factor in the calculation or an error in the problem setup. Based on the options provided, the best choice is:

**Answer: C**
