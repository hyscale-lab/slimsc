Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating non-Gaussianity using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The state given is a Schrödinger cat state. The state vector is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. I remember that |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states, right? And N is the normalization constant. The normalization N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha²)). 

The task is to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure. The formula provided is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.



---------------

Wait, non-Gaussian states are those that can't be described by Gaussian statistics, like coherent, squeezed, or thermal states. So the question is about measuring how non-Gaussian this particular state is.

The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. So let's plug those in.

First, let's compute N. N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha²)). Let's compute sin(2phi) when phi is -pi/4. 2phi is -pi/2, so sin(-pi/2) is -1. Then exp(-2*(0.5)^2) is exp(-0.5) which is about 0.6065. So sin(2phi)*exp(...) is (-1)*0.6065 = -0.6065. So 1 + (-0.6065) is 0.3935. Then N is sqrt(0.3935) which is approximately 0.6275.

So the state |psi> is (cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5>)/0.6275.

Cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2, which is about 0.7071. Sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2, same magnitude, but negative. So the coefficients are 0.7071 and -0.7071, but divided by N.



---------------

Wait, but wait: in the state, it's cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>. So with phi=-pi/4, cos(phi)=sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi)=-sqrt(2)/2. So the state becomes [ (sqrt(2)/2)|0.5> - (sqrt(2)/2)|-0.5> ] / N.

But the exact values might not matter yet. Let's think about the density matrices. The state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states. Coherent states are Gaussian states, but their superposition is non-Gaussian. So the state rho is non-Gaussian, and tau is a Gaussian state, perhaps a coherent state or maybe the maximally mixed Gaussian state.



---------------

Wait, the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is the difference between the von Neumann entropy of rho and tau. 

---------------

But wait, the formula given is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. 

---------------

Wait, that's actually the von Neumann entropy of rho minus that of tau. So S(rho) - S(tau). Since entropy is always positive, but I'm not sure if del_b can be negative. 

---------------

Wait, but non-Gaussian states usually have higher entropy compared to Gaussian states? Or maybe it's the other way around. I'm a bit confused.



---------------

Wait, the relative entropy is a measure of how different rho is from tau. So if rho is non-Gaussian, and tau is a Gaussian state, then if rho is more mixed, the entropy S(rho) would be higher, so del_b would be positive. But I'm not entirely certain.



---------------

Wait, but the problem is about the non-Gaussianity, which is the relative entropy between rho and a reference Gaussian state. So to compute nG, I need to compute the relative entropy, which is S(rho) - S(tau). 

---------------

But wait, no, the relative entropy is usually defined as S(rho || tau) = Tr(rho log rho) - Tr(rho log tau). 

---------------

Oh wait, that's different. Wait, in this problem, the formula given is del_b = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). So that's S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von Neumann entropy. Because S(rho) is Tr(rho ln rho), and similarly for tau.

So the non-Gaussianity is the difference in the entropies. 

---------------

But wait, wait. The von Neumann entropy of a Gaussian state can sometimes be higher or lower than a non-Gaussian state, depending on the situation. For example, if the Gaussian state is a coherent state, it's a pure state, so S(tau) would be zero. But the non-Gaussian state here is a superposition, which is a pure state as well. So in that case, S(rho) would be zero, and S(tau) would be zero, so del_b would be zero. That can't be right. So perhaps the reference Gaussian state is not a pure state.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the maximally mixed Gaussian state. Or perhaps it's the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as the non-Gaussian state. 

---------------

Wait, but I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the one that minimizes the relative entropy. So it's the Gaussian state closest to rho in some sense. But I'm not exactly sure about that.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is a thermal state or a squeezed state. Hmm.

But wait, let's think about the state |psi>. It's a superposition of two coherent states. The density matrix rho would be |psi><psi|, which is a pure state. So S(rho) is zero, since rho is pure. But what about tau? If tau is a Gaussian state, perhaps a maximally mixed Gaussian state. Or maybe it's a Gaussian state that best approximates rho.



---------------

Wait, but wait. The von Neumann entropy is zero for a pure state. So if tau is a Gaussian state that's also pure, then S(tau) is zero. Then del_b would be zero. But that can't be the case, because the options don't include zero except option D. Hmm, but wait, the problem says "relative entropy measure", which is the formula given. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.



---------------

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity. Another possibility is that the non-Gaussianity is computed with respect to a specific Gaussian state, perhaps the maximally mixed one. But I'm not entirely certain.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the vacuum state. But the vacuum state is a Gaussian state, and if rho is a superposition of coherent states, which are displaced vacuum states, then the entropy difference could be something else.



---------------

Wait, maybe I should compute the density matrices for both rho and tau. Let's see.

The state |psi> is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. So rho is |psi><psi|.

But what is the reference Gaussian state tau? The problem says tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. So perhaps tau is a Gaussian state that is the closest to rho in some sense, but without knowing more, it's hard to say.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the maximally mixed Gaussian state with the same purity as rho. But I'm not sure.



---------------

Wait, but in the case where the state is a superposition of two coherent states, the density matrix rho is a pure state, so S(rho) = 0. The reference Gaussian state might be a mixed state, perhaps a thermal state, which has a certain entropy. So if tau is a Gaussian state with the same purity as rho, but being Gaussian, maybe it has a different entropy.



---------------

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the properties of the state.

Wait, let's compute N first. For phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

N = sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) * exp(-2 alpha²)).

2 phi is -pi/2. sin(-pi/2) is -1.

exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

So N = sqrt(1 + (-1)(0.6065)) = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state |psi> is [ cos(-pi/4) |0.5> + sin(-pi/4) | -0.5> ] / 0.6275.

cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071, sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

So |psi> = [0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 | -0.5> ] / 0.6275.



---------------

But wait, coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha> are orthogonal when alpha is real and non-zero. Because <alpha| -alpha> = exp(-|alpha|^2) e^{2i Im(alpha)}, but since alpha is real (as given), the overlap is exp(-alpha²) e^{0} = exp(-alpha²). 

---------------

Wait, but for real alpha, |alpha> and |-alpha> are not orthogonal unless alpha is zero.

Wait, let me compute <alpha | -alpha> = exp(-|alpha|^2) e^{2i Im(alpha)}. Since alpha is real, Im(alpha)=0, so <alpha| -alpha> = exp(-alpha^2).

So for alpha=0.5, this is exp(-0.25) ≈ 0.7788.

So the inner product is not zero, so the states |alpha> and |-alpha> are not orthogonal. So the state |psi> is a superposition of two non-orthogonal states.

But perhaps I'm getting too deep into that. Let's think about the density matrix rho. rho is |psi><psi|, which would be a pure state, so its entropy is zero.



---------------

Wait, but the problem is about the relative entropy measure with respect to a Gaussian state. So if tau is a Gaussian state, perhaps the vacuum state, which is a pure Gaussian state, then S(tau)=0 as well. So del_b would be zero minus zero, which is zero. But that's option D. So the answer would be D) 0.



---------------

Wait, but that can't be right because the state is non-Gaussian, but perhaps the relative entropy isn't zero because the states are different. Hmm, but relative entropy being zero would imply that the states are identical, which they are not. So maybe I'm missing something.



---------------

Wait, no. The relative entropy as defined here is S(rho) - S(tau), not the usual relative entropy which is S(rho || tau). So if rho is pure (S(rho)=0) and tau is a pure Gaussian state (S(tau)=0), then del_b would be zero. But that doesn't make sense because the state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity shouldn't be zero. So maybe the reference Gaussian state isn't pure.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state isn't pure. Maybe it's a maximally mixed Gaussian state, which would have maximum entropy. For a single mode, the maximum entropy Gaussian state is the thermal state with the highest possible entropy, which is when the temperature is infinite, so it's the vacuum. 

---------------

Wait, no, the vacuum is pure, so maybe it's the completely mixed state, but for Gaussian states, the completely mixed state isn't Gaussian unless it's a thermal state with some parameters.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is a coherent state with the same first moment as rho. Wait, but rho is a superposition, so its first moment might be different.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the one that has the same first and second moments as rho, but is Gaussian. So to find tau, we'd have to compute the first and second moments of rho and then construct a Gaussian state with those moments.

But that's complicated. Let me think. The state |psi> is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, so let's compute the expectation values.

The expectation value of the position operator x would be (since coherent states have expectation values proportional to alpha):



---------------

But wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the first and second moments.

The density matrix rho is |psi><psi|. So the first moment <x> would be Tr(rho x), and the second moment <x²> would be Tr(rho x²).

But calculating that might be complicated. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states, so the expectation value of x would be [cos^2(phi) alpha + sin^2(phi) (-alpha)] / N^2. 

---------------

Wait, but let's see.

Wait, more accurately, the expectation value <x> is given by:

Tr(rho x) = [ <alpha| + < -alpha | ] (cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) | -alpha> ) / N^2 * x (cos(phi) <alpha| + sin(phi) < -alpha | ) ) 



---------------

Wait, maybe I'm getting too stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the Wigner function of the state. A superposition of two coherent states would have a Wigner function that is non-positive in some regions, which is a hallmark of non-Gaussianity.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the options. The options are A) 2.48, B) 0.25, C) 1.38, D) 0.

If the non-Gaussianity is the difference in entropies, and if the state is pure (S(rho)=0) and the reference Gaussian state is also pure (S(tau)=0), then the del_b would be zero. So the non-Gaussianity would be zero, which is option D.

But that can't be correct because the state is non-Gaussian. 

---------------

Wait, but the relative entropy as defined here is the difference between the entropies of rho and tau, not the relative entropy between rho and tau. So if both are pure, the difference is zero, implying no non-Gaussianity. But that seems counterintuitive.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state isn't pure. Maybe it's a maximally mixed state, which would have S(tau) = 1 (in nats, or ln 2 units if using base 2), but I'm not sure.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the vacuum, which is pure. So S(rho)=0, S(tau)=0, del_b=0.

But then why is the non-Gaussianity zero? Because both are pure states, but one is non-Gaussian. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the definition of non-Gaussianity here.



---------------

Wait, another approach: perhaps the relative entropy measure for non-Gaussianity is defined as the relative entropy between the state rho and the closest Gaussian state tau. But in that case, it's not just the difference in entropies; it's the full relative entropy.



---------------

Wait, the formula given is del_b = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau) = S(rho) - S(tau). But the relative entropy between rho and tau is usually S(rho || tau) = S(rho) - S(rho_tilde) where rho_tilde is the state that minimizes the entropy. Hmm, I'm getting confused.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the relative entropy between rho and tau as the measure. But the given formula isn't the standard relative entropy. Because the standard relative entropy is S(rho || tau) = Tr(rho (ln rho - ln tau)). That's different from what's given here.

So according to the problem, del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)] = S(rho) - S(tau).

But if rho is a non-Gaussian state and tau is a Gaussian state, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is S(rho) - S(tau). But in the case where rho is a pure state (S(rho)=0) and tau is a pure Gaussian state (S(tau)=0), del_b would be zero. So the non-Gaussianity would be zero, which is option D.

But that seems to suggest that the non-Gaussian state has zero non-Gaussianity, which can't be right. So perhaps I'm missing something.



---------------

Wait, maybe the reference Gaussian state isn't a pure state. Maybe it's a maximally mixed Gaussian state. Let's think: for a single mode, the maximum entropy Gaussian state is the thermal state with infinite temperature, which is the vacuum. 

---------------

Wait, no, the vacuum is pure. The maximally mixed Gaussian state for a single mode is the completely depolarized state, which has entropy S=1 (in nats) for a single qubit, but for a continuous variable system, I'm not sure. 

---------------

Wait, perhaps in this case, the reference Gaussian state is the completely mixed Gaussian state, which has the maximum possible entropy for a Gaussian state. Then, S(tau) would be higher, making del_b positive.

But without knowing the exact form of tau, it's hard to compute. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed in such a way that the non-Gaussianity is zero. Maybe because the state is a superposition of two coherent states with equal amplitudes and opposite phases, leading to a Gaussian state.



---------------

Wait, wait. Let me think again about the state. The state is |psi> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N.

If phi is such that cos(phi) = sin(phi), then |psi> is (|alpha> + |-alpha>)/sqrt(2 N^2), but perhaps in this case, the state might be Gaussian.



---------------

Wait, when phi is -pi/4, cos(phi) = sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi) = -sqrt(2)/2. So the state becomes [ |alpha> - |-alpha> ] / (sqrt(2) N ). Hmm, but wait, when alpha is real, |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states with real amplitudes, and their difference could lead to a non-Gaussian state.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps for certain parameters, the state becomes Gaussian. For example, when the state is a cat state, which is a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases, it's known to be highly non-Gaussian. 

---------------

But wait, in some cases, like when the two amplitudes are orthogonal, perhaps the state becomes a squeezed state, which is Gaussian.



---------------

Wait, wait. Let me think about the case when the state is a superposition of two coherent states that are orthogonal. If |alpha> and |-alpha> are orthogonal, then the state |psi> would be a maximally mixed state, which is a pure state but non-Gaussian. But in our case, alpha is 0.5, so |alpha> and |-alpha> are not orthogonal because <alpha| -alpha> = exp(-alpha^2) = exp(-0.25) ≈ 0.7788, so they are not orthogonal.

So |psi> is a superposition of two non-orthogonal coherent states. Now, what's the density matrix rho? rho = |psi><psi|.

But regardless, the state is a pure state, so S(rho)=0.

If the reference Gaussian state tau is also pure, then S(tau)=0, so del_b=0, which would be option D. But that can't be right because the state is non-Gaussian. Hmm.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is not pure. Maybe it's the maximally mixed Gaussian state. Let's say that the entropy of tau is S(tau)=1. Then, since S(rho)=0, del_b = 0 - 1 = -1. But that's not one of the options.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the vacuum, which is pure (S(tau)=0), so del_b=0. But that would suggest that the non-Gaussianity is zero, which contradicts the expectation.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the problem statement again. The relative entropy measure is given as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So it's the difference in the von Neumann entropies. If rho is a pure state, S(rho)=0. If tau is a pure Gaussian state, then S(tau)=0. So del_b=0.

But that can't be right because the state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero. But according to the problem, the options include D) 0. So perhaps the answer is D) 0. But why?



---------------

Wait, maybe the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is actually Gaussian. How? Because the state |psi> is a Gaussian state.



---------------

Wait, can a superposition of two coherent states be Gaussian? Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superpositions are usually non-Gaussian. But under certain conditions, perhaps it's Gaussian.



---------------

Wait, for example, if the two coherent states are orthogonal and have the same amplitude, the superposition could be a squeezed state, which is Gaussian. But in our case, |alpha> and |-alpha> are not orthogonal, so that's not the case.



---------------

Wait, but wait. Let's compute the Wigner function of |psi> to see if it's Gaussian.

The Wigner function of a coherent state |alpha> is Gaussian. The Wigner function of a superposition of two coherent states is non-Gaussian. So the state |psi> must be non-Gaussian, implying that the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.

But according to the calculation, del_b is zero because both rho and tau are pure. So I'm confused.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is not a pure state. Maybe it's a mixed state, and tau is the maximally mixed Gaussian state. In that case, S(tau) would be higher than zero. So del_b would be S(rho) - S(tau) = 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau). But then del_b would be negative, but the options don't have negative numbers.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the formula is the other way around. Maybe it's S(tau) - S(rho). But the problem states it's [rho ln rho] - [tau ln tau], which would be S(rho) - S(tau). So if S(rho) is less than S(tau), del_b would be negative.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe the answer is D) 0 because the non-Gaussianity is defined as the difference between the entropies, and for pure states, it's zero regardless of whether the state is Gaussian or not.

But that doesn't make sense because non-Gaussian states should have non-zero non-Gaussianity. So perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the state is Gaussian, making the non-Gaussianity zero.



---------------

Wait, when can a superposition of coherent states be Gaussian? Only if the superposition leads to a state that is a Gaussian state. For example, a squeezed state is a Gaussian state and can be written as a superposition of coherent states, but with specific coefficients and phases.



---------------

Wait, perhaps when the phase phi is such that the state becomes a squeezed state. Let's see. The given state is |psi> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N.

If phi is such that the coefficients lead to a squeezed state, then the state is Gaussian, making non-Gaussianity zero. But for phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5, is that the case?

I'm not sure. Let me think about the general form of a squeezed state. A squeezed vacuum state can be written as S(r) |0>, where S is the squeezing operator. The squeezing operator can be expressed in terms of exponentials of (a^2 and (a†)^2) operators.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the state |psi> can be written as a squeezed state under certain conditions. But I'm not sure about the exact conditions.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the state |psi> is a coherent state when phi is zero or pi/2. Let me see:

At phi=0, |psi> becomes |alpha> / sqrt(1 + 0) = |alpha>, which is a Gaussian state.

At phi=pi/2, |psi> becomes [0 + 1 * |-alpha> ] / N. N is sqrt(1 + sin(pi) exp(-2 alpha^2)) = sqrt(1 + 0) =1. So |psi> = |-alpha>, which is a Gaussian state.

So for phi=0 and phi=pi/2, the state is Gaussian. But for other phi values, it's a superposition of two different coherent states, leading to a non-Gaussian state.

In our case, phi is -pi/4, which is between 0 and pi/2, so the state is a superposition, hence non-Gaussian. So the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.

But according to the earlier calculation, del_b is zero because both rho and tau are pure. So perhaps the problem is considering the relative entropy differently. Maybe the formula is S(rho||tau), which would be different.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is not pure. Maybe it's a thermal state or a mixed Gaussian state. But without knowing which Gaussian state to use, I can't compute the exact entropy.



---------------

Wait, maybe the problem is designed so that the non-Gaussianity is zero. Perhaps because the state is a Gaussian state. But earlier, I thought that when phi is not 0 or pi/2, the state is non-Gaussian.



---------------

Wait, let's think about the state |psi> when phi is -pi/4.

The state is [ |alpha> - |-alpha> ] / N.



---------------

Wait, if we expand this, perhaps it's a squeezed state.

Wait, perhaps the state can be rewritten as a squeezed state. Let's consider the case when alpha is real. The state |alpha> is a coherent state, and |-alpha> is another coherent state.

The state |psi> is (|alpha> - |-alpha>)/sqrt(2) when N is 1. But in our case, N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the state can be written as a squeezed state. Let me recall that a squeezed vacuum state can be written as S(r) |0>, where S(r) is the squeezing operator.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a two-photon coherent state or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a coherent state under a different parameter. But I don't think so.



---------------

Another thought: perhaps the state is a cat state, which is known to be non-Gaussian. So the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero, so option D can't be correct.

But according to the problem statement, the relative entropy is calculated as S(rho) - S(tau). So if S(rho) is zero (because rho is pure) and S(tau) is zero (because tau is a pure Gaussian state), then del_b is zero, which would suggest option D.

But this seems contradictory. So perhaps I'm missing a key point here.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different reference Gaussian state. For example, the reference Gaussian state could be the maximally mixed state, which has maximum entropy. For a single mode, the maximum entropy Gaussian state is the thermal state with infinite temperature, which is the vacuum, but that's pure. So that doesn't help.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the vacuum, but rho is a non-pure state. But in this case, rho is a pure state because it's a superposition, so S(rho)=0.



---------------

Wait, but wait. Let me compute N again. N is sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)).

At phi=-pi/4, 2 phi = -pi/2, so sin(-pi/2)=-1. alpha=0.5, so exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-0.5)≈0.6065.

So N = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) ≈ sqrt(0.3935) ≈0.6275.

So |psi> is [ (sqrt(2)/2)|0.5> - (sqrt(2)/2)|-0.5> ] / 0.6275.



---------------

But wait, perhaps the state can be written as a single coherent state. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a squeezed state. Because when you have a superposition of two coherent states, sometimes it can be expressed as a squeezed state.



---------------

Wait, for example, the squeezed vacuum state can be written as (|alpha> - | - alpha> ) / sqrt(2), but I'm not sure. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a single-photon Fock state, which is non-Gaussian, but that's not the case here.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the state can be expressed as a squeezed state. Let me think about the squeezing operator. The squeezing operator S(r) acts on the vacuum to produce a squeezed vacuum state. The squeezing parameter r can be complex, but for simplicity, let's consider real r.

The squeezed vacuum state S(r)|0> can be written as a superposition of even photon number states. But I'm not sure if it can be written as a superposition of two coherent states.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the state |psi> is a squeezed state. If that's the case, then it would be Gaussian, making the non-Gaussianity zero.

But how can I check that?

Let me compute the Wigner function. The Wigner function of a coherent state is Gaussian. The Wigner function of a squeezed state is also Gaussian. But the Wigner function of a superposition of two coherent states is non-Gaussian. So if |psi> is a Gaussian state, it must have a Gaussian Wigner function.

But for the state given, it's a superposition of two coherent states, which should have a non-Gaussian Wigner function, implying that the state is non-Gaussian. Thus, the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.

But according to the calculation of del_b being zero, which would suggest option D is correct.



---------------

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the relative entropy between the state and a reference Gaussian state, but the formula given is not the standard relative entropy. Perhaps it's the difference in the entropies, which would be zero if both are pure.

But that would imply that the non-Gaussianity is zero, which contradicts the expectation.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of another approach. Perhaps I can compute the density matrix rho and see if it's Gaussian.

The state rho is |psi><psi|. The density matrix for a Gaussian state has a specific form. For a single mode, a Gaussian state can be represented by its first and second moments. If the state rho has a density matrix that can be written in terms of the number operator and displacement, then it's Gaussian.

But for a superposition of coherent states, the density matrix would involve cross terms between |alpha> and |-alpha>, which are non-Gaussian. So the state is non-Gaussian, implying that the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.

But according to the formula, del_b is zero. So perhaps the problem is designed such that the non-Gaussianity is zero. But that would mean that the state is Gaussian, which seems contradictory.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the state is Gaussian under these specific parameters. Maybe when phi is -pi/4 and alpha=0.5, the state becomes Gaussian.



---------------

Wait, but how? Let me think about the state.

|psi> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N.

Let me choose phi such that the state becomes a coherent state. For example, if phi=0, then |psi> = |alpha>, which is Gaussian. Similarly, phi=pi/2 would make |psi> = |-alpha>, which is Gaussian.

But for other phi values, it's a superposition, which is non-Gaussian. So for phi=-pi/4, the state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.

But according to the calculation, del_b is zero. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the definition of non-Gaussianity here.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is defined as the relative entropy between rho and the closest Gaussian state. If the state is already Gaussian, then the relative entropy would be zero. But if it's non-Gaussian, then it would be positive.

But in this problem, the formula given isn't the relative entropy between rho and tau, but the difference in their entropies.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different definition of non-Gaussianity. For example, the Hilbert-Schmidt distance to the set of Gaussian states. But the problem states it's using relative entropy.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the problem is not correctly stated, and the non-Gaussianity is the relative entropy between rho and tau, which would be a positive quantity. But according to the formula given, it's the difference in entropies, which could be zero.

I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again. The options are A) 2.48, B) 0.25, C) 1.38, D) 0.

If the state is non-Gaussian, the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero, so D) 0 is unlikely. But according to the earlier calculation, del_b is zero because both states are pure. So perhaps the correct answer is D) 0.



---------------

Wait, but that would mean that the state is Gaussian, which contradicts the intuition. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's answer is D) 0 because the state is a cat state, which is non-Gaussian, but the non-Gaussianity measure happens to be zero.

But I'm not sure. I think I'll have to make an educated guess here. Since the state is a superposition, it's non-Gaussian, but according to the formula, the non-Gaussianity is zero. So perhaps the answer is D) 0.



---------------

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a different reference state. If the reference Gaussian state is a maximally mixed Gaussian state, then S(tau) would be higher than zero, making del_b positive.

But without knowing the exact form of tau, it's hard to say. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to realize that the state is Gaussian, leading to non-Gaussianity zero.

Wait, perhaps the state is a coherent state when phi is -pi/4. Let me compute N again.

N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*(-pi/4)) exp(-2*(0.5)^2)).

sin(-pi/2) = -1.

So N = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)) = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

But the state is [ cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Which is [ (sqrt(2)/2)|0.5> - (sqrt(2)/2)|-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Hmm, perhaps this can be written as a single coherent state. Let me think: can a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha> be written as a single coherent state?



---------------

Wait, |beta> = A [ |alpha> + e^{i theta} |-alpha> ].

If we choose theta and A appropriately, perhaps |beta> can be a coherent state. But I'm not sure about the exact conditions.



---------------

Wait, for the state to be a coherent state, it must satisfy the relation a|beta> = beta |beta>, where a is the annihilation operator.

Let me see if this state satisfies that condition. Let's compute a |psi>.

a |psi> = [ cos(phi) a |alpha> + sin(phi) a |-alpha> ] / N.

We know that a |alpha> = (alpha) |alpha> + sqrt(alpha^2 -1) ??? 

---------------

Wait, no. Wait, the annihilation operator acting on a coherent state |alpha> gives alpha |alpha>.

So a |alpha> = alpha |alpha>, and a |-alpha> = (-alpha) |-alpha>.

So a |psi> = [ cos(phi) alpha |alpha> + sin(phi) (-alpha) |-alpha> ] / N.

Which is [ alpha cos(phi) |alpha> - alpha sin(phi) |-alpha> ] / N.

But |psi> is [ cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) |-alpha> ] / N.

So a |psi> = alpha [ cos(phi) |alpha> - sin(phi) |-alpha> ] / N.

Which is alpha [ (cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) |-alpha> ) - 2 sin(phi) |-alpha> ] / N.



---------------

Wait, perhaps this can be written as alpha times a combination. Let me factor this out.

a |psi> = alpha [ cos(phi) |alpha> - sin(phi) |-alpha> ] / N.

But |psi> is [ cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) |-alpha> ] / N.

So unless alpha is zero or some other condition, a |psi> won't be equal to beta |psi>, meaning |psi> isn't a coherent state.

Thus, the state isn't a coherent state, implying it's non-Gaussian. So the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.

But according to the formula given, del_b is zero. So perhaps the problem is using a different definition, leading to the non-Gaussianity being zero.

I'm stuck. I think I'll have to go with the calculation that del_b is zero, so the answer is D) 0.


The problem involves calculating the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is defined as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N},
\]
where \( \alpha \) is the amplitude, \( \phi \) is the phase, and \( N \) is the normalization constant given by:

\[
N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi) \exp(-2\alpha^2)}.
\]

The relative entropy measure is defined as:

\[
\Delta_b = \text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau),
\]
where \( \rho \) is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state \( |\psi\rangle \), and \( \tau \) is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Normalization Constant \( N \):**
   For \( \phi = -\pi/4 \) and \( \alpha = 0.5 \):
   \[
   \sin(2\phi) = \sin(-\pi/2) = -1, \quad \exp(-2\alpha^2) = \exp(-0.5) \approx 0.6065.
   \]
   Substituting into \( N \):
   \[
   N = \sqrt{1 + (-1)(0.6065)} = \sqrt{1 - 0.6065} = \sqrt{0.3935} \approx 0.6275.
   \]

2. **State \( |\psi\rangle \):**
   Substituting \( \phi = -\pi/4 \) and \( \alpha = 0.5 \):
   \[
   |\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(-\pi/4)|0.5\rangle + \sin(-\pi/4)|-0.5\rangle}{0.6275}.
   \]
   Using \( \cos(-\pi/4) = \sin(\pi/4) = \sqrt{2}/2 \approx 0.7071 \) and \( \sin(-\pi/4) = -\sqrt{2}/2 \approx -0.7071 \):
   \[
   |\psi\rangle = \frac{0.7071|0.5\rangle - 0.7071|-0.5\rangle}{0.6275}.
   \]

3. **Non-Gaussianity and Relative Entropy:**
   The state \( |\psi\rangle \) is a superposition of two coherent states \( |0.5\rangle \) and \( |-0.5\rangle \). Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superposition is generally non-Gaussian. However, the relative entropy measure \( \Delta_b \) is defined as the difference in von Neumann entropies:
   \[
   \Delta_b = S(\rho) - S(\tau),
   \]
   where \( S(\rho) = \text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) \) and \( S(\tau) = \text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau) \).

   - If \( \rho \) is a pure state (as it is for \( |\psi\rangle \)), \( S(\rho) = 0 \).
   - If \( \tau \) is a pure Gaussian state (e.g., a coherent state), \( S(\tau) = 0 \).

   Thus, \( \Delta_b = 0 - 0 = 0 \), implying no non-Gaussianity. This result aligns with the fact that the relative entropy measure as defined here does not capture the non-Gaussian nature of the state.

4. **Critical Evaluation of Options:**
   - **Option A (2.48):** This value is inconsistent with the calculation, as the relative entropy measure yields zero.
   - **Option B (0.25):** Similarly inconsistent with the calculation.
   - **Option C (1.38):** Also inconsistent with the calculation.
   - **Option D (0):** Matches the result of the calculation, where \( \Delta_b = 0 \).

### Conclusion:
The non-Gaussianity, as defined by the given relative entropy measure, is zero because both \( \rho \) and \( \tau \) are pure states, leading to \( S(\rho) = S(\tau) = 0 \). Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
