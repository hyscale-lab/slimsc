Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. Oh right, N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi)*exp(-2alpha²)). 

---------------

Oh wait, and phi is given as -pi/4, and alpha is 0.5. So I need to plug these values into the formula.



---------------

Wait, non-Gaussianity here is measured using relative entropy. The formula is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). Tau is the reference Gaussian state, and rho is the non-Gaussian state's density matrix.



---------------

But wait a second, the state given is a superposition of coherent states. Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superposition is non-Gaussian. So the state |psi> is non-Gaussian, right? So the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero. So option D, which is 0, probably isn't the right answer unless something cancels out.

But I'm not sure. Let's think about when the state becomes Gaussian. If the state is a single coherent state, then it's Gaussian. But here it's a superposition of two coherent states, so definitely non-Gaussian.

So the relative entropy should be positive, meaning the non-Gaussianity is positive. So options A, B, or C are possibilities. But let me think deeper.



---------------

Wait, the relative entropy is between the state rho and a Gaussian state tau. So if the state is already Gaussian, the relative entropy would be zero. But since the state is a superposition, it's non-Gaussian, so the relative entropy should be positive, which means non-Gaussianity is positive. So option D is zero, which would be incorrect.



---------------

But wait, maybe if the state is a specific superposition that's actually Gaussian? Hmm, that's possible if the state can be written as another Gaussian state. Let me see: a superposition of two coherent states. Are there any conditions under which this becomes a Gaussian state?

I remember that for certain parameters, like when the superposition is symmetric or when the phase phi is such that the cross terms vanish. 

---------------

Wait, in our case, phi is -pi/4, so sin(2phi) would be sin(-pi/2) = -1. So the normalization N becomes sqrt(1 + (-1)*exp(-2*(0.5)^2)).

Calculating that: 0.5 squared is 0.25, multiplied by 2 gives 0.5. So exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065. So N is sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.627.



---------------

Wait, but maybe the state simplifies in some way. Let me think: when you have a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, perhaps when phi is such that the coefficients make it a specific kind of state.



---------------

Wait, the state is |psi> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N. For phi = -pi/4, cos(phi) is cos(-pi/4) which is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071, and sin(phi) is sin(-pi/4) which is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071. So the state becomes [ 0.7071 |alpha> - 0.7071 |-alpha> ] / N.



---------------

But wait, |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states. So when you take their superposition with coefficients of equal magnitude but opposite signs, does that form a specific state like a squeezed state or something else?



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps when the state is an equal superposition, it's an eigenstate of the position or momentum operator, but I'm not sure.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps in some cases, this state becomes a squeezed vacuum state, which is Gaussian. But I'm not entirely certain.



---------------

Wait, but the non-Gaussianity is being measured relative to a Gaussian state. So if the state |psi> is actually Gaussian, then the relative entropy would be zero, making the non-Gaussianity zero. So I need to check if the given state is Gaussian.

But how can a superposition of coherent states be Gaussian? Because Gaussian states are those that can be written as displaced Gaussian (coherent) states or squeezed states. But a superposition of two different coherent states isn't a Gaussian state. 

---------------

Wait, unless the superposition has a specific form, like a cat state. Oh wait, the question is about a Schrödinger cat state, which is a specific non-Gaussian state. So the state in the question is a non-Gaussian state, so the non-Gaussianity shouldn't be zero.



---------------

Wait, but wait another thought. The relative entropy is between rho and tau, where tau is a Gaussian state. So if the state |psi> is Gaussian, then rho would be the same as tau, so the entropy difference would be zero. But since it's a cat state, it's non-Gaussian, so the relative entropy should be positive.

So why is option D (0) one of the options? Maybe I made a mistake in thinking. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps under certain conditions, the state becomes Gaussian.

Wait, another approach: perhaps when the parameters are such that the state becomes a single coherent state. Let's see: when phi is zero, sin(phi) is zero, so the state becomes |alpha> / sqrt(1), since N would be sqrt(1+0) =1. So when phi is zero, it's a coherent state, which is Gaussian. So in that case, the non-Gaussianity would be zero.

But in our case, phi is -pi/4, which is not zero, so the state is a superposition of two coherent states. So the state is non-Gaussian, implying non-zero non-Gaussianity. So the answer shouldn't be D.



---------------

But wait, maybe for specific values of alpha and phi, the state is Gaussian. Let me see. For example, if phi is pi/2, then sin(2phi) is sin(pi) = 0. So N becomes sqrt(1 +0) =1. Then the state becomes sin(phi)|-alpha> /1. 

---------------

Wait, sin(pi/2) is 1, so the state is | - alpha >, which is a coherent state, so Gaussian. So in that case, non-Gaussianity is zero.

But in our problem, phi is -pi/4, so 2phi is -pi/2. So sin(2phi) is -1. So N is sqrt(1 - exp(-2 alpha²)).

Hmm. Let me compute N with alpha=0.5. Then 2alpha^2 = 2*(0.25) = 0.5. exp(-0.5) is about 0.6065. So 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.627.

So the state is [ cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5> ] / 0.627.

Which is [ (sqrt(2)/2)|0.5> - (sqrt(2)/2)|-0.5> ] / 0.627.



---------------

Wait, but perhaps this state can be written as a single coherent state? Or maybe a squeezed state?

Wait, another thought: coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator. If the state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, perhaps it's a cat state, which is non-Gaussian.

But perhaps in some cases, the state is Gaussian. Like if it's a single coherent state. But in this case, it's a superposition, so it's non-Gaussian.

So the non-Gaussianity should be positive, so options A, B, or C are possible.

But how to compute it? Because I don't remember the exact formula for relative entropy in this context.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps there's a trick. The relative entropy is the difference between the von Neumann entropy of rho and tau. But if rho is a pure state, then trace(rho ln rho) is zero (since rho is a projection operator, its entropy is zero). 

---------------

But wait, wait no: the von Neumann entropy is S(rho) = -Tr(rho ln rho). If rho is a pure state, S(rho) is zero.



---------------

Wait, but here rho is the state |psi><psi|, so it's a pure state. So the von Neumann entropy of rho is zero. So del_b = 0 - [ trace(tau ln tau) ].



---------------

Wait, no: the formula is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So if rho is pure, trace(rho ln rho) is zero, so del_b = - trace(tau ln tau).

But that's only if rho is pure. 

---------------

Wait, no, wait: rho is pure, so its entropy is zero. So trace(rho ln rho) is zero, because rho is a projector.



---------------

Wait, no: rho is |psi><psi|, so rho^2 = rho. So ln(rho) is ln(|psi><psi|) which is ln(rho) where rho is a projector. Hmm, but ln(rho) for a projector is problematic because it's not analytic. 

---------------

Wait, actually, the von Neumann entropy is defined as -Tr(rho ln rho), but for pure states, rho is a rank-1 projector, so ln(rho) is ln(1) which is zero for the non-zero component. So the von Neumann entropy of a pure state is zero.

So if rho is pure, then trace(rho ln rho) is zero.

So del_b = 0 - trace(tau ln tau) = - trace(tau ln tau). But trace(tau ln tau) is the entropy of the Gaussian state tau. So del_b would be negative. But relative entropy is usually defined as S(rho || tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). 

---------------

Wait, but in the question, it's given as del_b = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau), which is a bit different.



---------------

Wait, the relative entropy here is defined as the difference between rho's entropy and tau's entropy. So S(rho) is zero (since rho is pure), and S(tau) is the entropy of the Gaussian state.

So del_b = 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau). But since S(tau) is positive, del_b would be negative. But that can't be right because relative entropy is usually non-negative when rho is the true state. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the definition wrong.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different convention. Let me think again.

The relative entropy measure given is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)].

So if rho is pure, trace(rho ln rho) is zero. So del_b = - trace(tau ln tau). But trace(tau ln tau) is the entropy of the Gaussian state. So del_b would be negative. But how can that be? Because relative entropy is usually S(rho || tau) = S(rho) - S(rho relative to tau). Hmm, perhaps the question is using a different definition.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the B relative entropy, which is defined as S(rho||tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). But in the question, it's written as Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau), which is different. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the non-Gaussianity is defined as the relative entropy between the state and the most similar Gaussian state. But I'm not sure about the exact definition.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the difference in their entropies. So if rho is more non-Gaussian, its entropy would be different.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is the state that is closest to rho in some sense. But without knowing the specifics, it's hard to proceed.

But let me think differently. For a given state, the non-Gaussianity can sometimes be zero. For example, when the state itself is Gaussian. So in this case, if the state is Gaussian, the relative entropy would be zero. But earlier analysis suggests that the state is a superposition and hence non-Gaussian. So why is option D (0) an option?



---------------

Wait, maybe when the state is a cat state with alpha=0.5 and phi=-pi/4, it's actually a Gaussian state. How?



---------------

Wait, perhaps when alpha is zero. Then the state becomes [ cos(phi)|0> + sin(phi)|0> ] / N. Because |alpha> is |0> when alpha=0. So N would be sqrt(1 + sin(2phi)*1) = sqrt(1 + sin(2phi)). For phi=-pi/4, 2phi=-pi/2, sin is -1. So N = sqrt(1-1)=0. Which can't be, so alpha can't be zero in this case. So that's not applicable.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps when the state is an even or odd coherent state, which are non-Gaussian. But I'm not sure how that applies here.



---------------

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the given options. The options are A: 2.48, B:0.25, C:1.38, D:0.

If the state is a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases, it's a non-Gaussian state, so the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero. So D is zero, which would be incorrect. So the correct answer must be A, B, or C.

But how to compute it? I'm not sure. Since I'm a bit stuck, maybe I can think about what the answer is. Since the state is a cat state, which is highly non-Gaussian, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is significant, which would suggest option A (2.48) is the answer. But I'm not certain.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the given state is actually a Gaussian state for these parameters. Let me think again. Maybe when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5, the state is Gaussian. How?



---------------

Wait, perhaps the state can be written as a single coherent state. Let me see: when you have a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, can it be rewritten as another coherent state?

The state is |psi> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N. Let me compute N.

phi = -pi/4, so cos(phi)=sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi)= -sqrt(2)/2. So:

|psi> = [ (sqrt(2)/2) |alpha> - (sqrt(2)/2) |-alpha> ] / N.

N = sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)).

sin(2phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1. So N = sqrt(1 - exp(-2*(0.5)^2)).

exp(-2*0.25)=exp(-0.5)= ~0.6065.

So N= sqrt(1 -0.6065)=sqrt(0.3935)=~0.627.

So |psi> = [ (sqrt(2)/2) |0.5> - (sqrt(2)/2)|-0.5> ] / 0.627.

Hmm. Let me compute the coefficients numerically. sqrt(2)/2 is approximately 0.7071. So the coefficients are 0.7071 / 0.627 ≈ 1.127.

So the state is approximately 1.127 |0.5> - 1.127 | -0.5>.



---------------

Wait, but coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha> are orthogonal, right? Because <alpha | -alpha> = exp(-|alpha|^2/2) * something? Hmm, no, wait, the inner product of |alpha> and |-alpha> is exp(-|alpha|^2/2) * e^{i alpha^2/2} * e^{-i alpha^2/2}? 

---------------

Wait, maybe it's more complicated.

Wait, the inner product <alpha | beta> is exp( - (|alpha|^2 + |beta|^2)/2 + alpha* beta^* ), assuming real alphas and betas. So in this case, beta is -alpha. So <alpha | -alpha> = exp( - (alpha^2 + alpha^2)/2 + alpha*(-alpha) ) = exp( -alpha^2 + (-alpha^2) )= exp(-2 alpha^2).

So for alpha=0.5, <0.5 | -0.5> = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

So the density matrix rho for |psi> is |psi><psi|.

Calculating the density matrix might be complicated, but perhaps I can compute the relative entropy.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps there's a known formula for the non-Gaussianity of such states. I remember that for the cat state, the non-Gaussianity can be calculated using the relative entropy of steering or something similar.

But I'm not sure about the exact formula. 

---------------

Alternatively, maybe the non-Gaussianity is zero in some cases. Wait, maybe when the state is a squeezed state, which is Gaussian. But I don't think the given state is a squeezed state.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps when the state is a coherent state, which is Gaussian, but that's only when the state is a single coherent state.



---------------

Wait, perhaps if the parameters make the state a single coherent state. Let me see when that happens.

The state is [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N.

If cos(phi) = 0, then the state is sin(phi)|-alpha> / N. But N would be sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)).

If cos(phi) =0, phi would be pi/2 or -pi/2. Let's take phi = pi/2. Then sin(phi)=1. So sin(2phi)=sin(pi)=0. So N=1. So the state becomes | - alpha >. Which is a coherent state, hence Gaussian. So in that case, non-Gaussianity is zero.

But in our case, phi is -pi/4, so it's not pi/2. So the state is a superposition, hence non-Gaussian. So the non-Gaussianity is non-zero.



---------------

But wait, perhaps when alpha is zero. Then |alpha> is |0>, and |-alpha> is also |0>, so the state becomes [cos(phi)|0> + sin(phi)|0> ] / N. But N would be sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * 1) = sqrt(1 + sin(2phi)).

If phi is such that sin(2phi) = -1, then N would be zero, which is impossible. So alpha can't be zero in this case.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps for some specific values of phi and alpha, the state becomes a squeezed vacuum state, which is Gaussian. But I'm not sure about that.

But I'm getting stuck trying to think of whether the state is Gaussian. Perhaps I should think about the given options. If the non-Gaussianity is zero, then option D is correct. But earlier reasoning suggests that the state is non-Gaussian, so D is wrong.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe when the state is written as a sum of |alpha> and |-alpha>, and given the normalization, it's actually a squeezed state.



---------------

Wait, squeezed vacuum states are Gaussian, but they are superpositions in a different sense. For example, a squeezed state can be written as a superposition of even or odd photon number states. But a superposition of coherent states is different.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps when the state is a cat state, which is a superposition of two coherent states, it's non-Gaussian. So the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.

But without knowing the exact calculation, I'm not sure. Given that, perhaps the correct answer is option D) 0, but that doesn't align with my earlier reasoning.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the state is actually a Gaussian state when the parameters are chosen such that it's a single coherent state. But with phi=-pi/4, it's a superposition, so it's non-Gaussian. So why is option D present?



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the state being a coherent state, but only when certain conditions are met.

Wait, another thought. The state is |psi> = (cos phi |alpha> + sin phi |-alpha> ) / N.

If phi is zero, then |psi> is |alpha> / 1, a coherent state. So for phi=0, the state is Gaussian. So in that case, non-Gaussianity is zero.

In our case, phi is -pi/4. So the state is a superposition, hence non-Gaussian. So non-Gaussianity should be positive, so D is incorrect.

But I'm not sure about the exact value. Among the options, C) 1.38 seems a reasonable number, but I'm not sure.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is Gaussian. But earlier analysis says it's not.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.



---------------

Wait, another approach: the state |psi> is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, but perhaps when phi is such that cos(phi)=sin(phi), which is when phi=pi/4, but in our case, phi is -pi/4.



---------------

Wait, in that case, cos(phi)=sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi)= -sqrt(2)/2.

So the state is ( |alpha> - | -alpha> ) / sqrt(2 * N^2), because N would be sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)).



---------------

Wait, perhaps the state is an eigenstate of the position operator, but I'm not sure.

But regardless, I think the state is non-Gaussian, so non-Gaussianity is positive.

So, the correct answer is not D. But I'm not certain which of the other options is correct. Without knowing the exact calculation, I'm a bit stuck.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero when the state is a coherent state. But in our case, it's a superposition, so non-zero. So D is not the answer.

Given that, perhaps the answer is C) 1.38. But I'm not entirely sure. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D) 0, but I think that's not the case.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the state is a Gaussian state because the density matrix can be expressed in a Gaussian form. Let me think about the density matrix.

The density matrix rho is |psi><psi|.

So rho = [ (cos phi |alpha> + sin phi |-alpha> ) ( <alpha| cos phi + < -alpha| sin phi ) ] / N^2.

Expanding this, rho = [ cos^2 phi |alpha><alpha| + cos phi sin phi |alpha><-alpha| + sin phi cos phi | -alpha><alpha| + sin^2 phi | -alpha>< -alpha| ] / N^2.

Now, considering the cross terms: |alpha><-alpha| and | -alpha><alpha|.

The expectation values of the position and momentum operators in such a state would involve terms from these cross terms. For Gaussian states, the density matrix can be expressed in terms of first and second moments, but superpositions usually lead to non-Gaussian features like higher-order moments.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a squeezed vacuum state. Wait, but a squeezed vacuum state is a superposition of even photon number states, not coherent states. So I don't think that's the case here.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the state is a coherent state in a different basis. Like, if the displacement is in a different direction. But I don't think so, because it's a superposition of two different coherent states.

In conclusion, I think the state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity is non-zero. So options A, B, or C are possible.

But without knowing the exact calculation steps, I'm not sure which one is correct. However, since the options given include 0 and non-zero, and I'm confident the state is non-Gaussian, I'll eliminate option D.



---------------

But wait, looking at the options, option D is zero, which I think is incorrect. So the answer must be one of the other options.



---------------

Wait, but maybe when phi is -pi/4, the state is actually a coherent state. How?

Wait, perhaps when phi is -pi/4, the combination of the coefficients and the phase causes the state to be a single coherent state. Let me check.

phi is -pi/4. So cos(phi) = sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi) = -sqrt(2)/2. So the state becomes [ (sqrt(2)/2)|alpha> + (-sqrt(2)/2)|-alpha> ] / N.

Which can be written as [ |alpha> - | -alpha> ] / (sqrt(2) N).

But this is a superposition, not a single coherent state. So the state remains non-Gaussian.

So, I think the non-Gaussianity is non-zero. So the answer must be one of A, B, or C.

But without knowing the exact calculation, I'm not certain. Since the problem is about the relative entropy measure, and the state is non-Gaussian, I'll have to make an educated guess.

Given that, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 1.38.


The problem involves calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state defined as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N},
\]
where \( N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}} \). The non-Gaussianity is measured using the relative entropy:

\[
\Delta_b = \text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau),
\]
where \(\rho\) is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and \(\tau\) is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Nature of the State**: The given state is a superposition of two coherent states \(|\alpha\rangle\) and \(|-\alpha\rangle\). Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superposition is generally non-Gaussian. This makes the state \(|\psi\rangle\) non-Gaussian unless specific conditions are met (e.g., reducing to a single coherent state).

2. **Parameters**: For \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\):
   - \(\cos(\phi) = \sin(\phi) = \sqrt{2}/2\), but with opposite signs.
   - \(N = \sqrt{1 - e^{-2\alpha^2}} = \sqrt{1 - e^{-0.5}} \approx 0.627\).
   - The state becomes:
     \[
     |\psi\rangle = \frac{\sqrt{2}/2 \cdot |0.5\rangle - \sqrt{2}/2 \cdot |-0.5\rangle}{0.627}.
     \]
     This is a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases, which is a hallmark of a non-Gaussian state.

3. **Non-Gaussianity**: Since the state is a superposition of coherent states, it is non-Gaussian. Therefore, the non-Gaussianity should be positive, ruling out option \(D = 0\).

4. **Relative Entropy**: The relative entropy \(\Delta_b\) involves the von Neumann entropy of the non-Gaussian state \(\rho\) and the reference Gaussian state \(\tau\). For a pure state like \(|\psi\rangle\), \(\text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) = 0\), so:
   \[
   \Delta_b = -\text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau).
   \]
   This implies that \(\Delta_b\) is positive, consistent with the state being non-Gaussian.

5. **Options**: Among the options, \(D = 0\) is incorrect because the state is non-Gaussian. The other options (\(A = 2.48\), \(B = 0.25\), \(C = 1.38\)) represent positive values of non-Gaussianity. Without exact calculations, the most reasonable choice based on the magnitude of the parameters is \(C = 1.38\).

### Conclusion:
The state is non-Gaussian, and the non-Gaussianity is positive. Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is:

**Answer: C**
