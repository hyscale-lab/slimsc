Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator given a specific state. Alright, let's break it down.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable, like P_z, is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in the given state.

The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me write that down. So, it's a three-component vector. And the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which makes sense because the matrix forms of P_x, P_y, and P_z are given in this basis.



---------------

Wait, the operator P_z is given as a diagonal matrix: the first row is (ħ, 0, 0), second (0,0,0), and third (0,0,-ħ). So P_z is diagonal, which means its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors here. So the state provided is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. That should simplify things because in this basis, measuring P_z is straightforward.



---------------

But wait, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. Oh, right, the state is given, so that's the state vector I have. So I don't need to worry about eigenstates of P_x unless I'm calculating expectation values for P_x, which I'm not. The question is about P_z's uncertainty.

So, to find ΔP_z, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩.



---------------

Wait, but the state is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Let me check if this is normalized. The sum of squares should be 1. Let's compute: ( (-1/2)^2 ) + ( (1/√2)^2 ) + ( (-1/2)^2 ) = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) = 1/2 plus 1/2 equals 1. Oh, okay, it's normalized. Good, so I don't have to normalize it.

Now, let's find ⟨P_z⟩. That's the expectation value of P_z in state |ψ⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, the expectation value is the sum of the diagonal elements multiplied by the respective probabilities (squares of the components of |ψ⟩).



---------------

Wait, another way: since P_z is diagonal, in the given basis, the expectation value is just the sum over the components of |ψ|^2 multiplied by the corresponding diagonal elements.

So, the components of |ψ⟩ are: ψ₁ = -1/2, ψ₂ = 1/√2, ψ₃ = -1/2.

The squares of these are |ψ₁|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4, |ψ₂|² = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2, |ψ₃|² = 1/4.

The diagonal elements of P_z are ħ, 0, -ħ.

So, ⟨P_z⟩ = |ψ₁|² * (ħ) + |ψ₂|² * 0 + |ψ₃|² * (-ħ) = (1/4)(ħ) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-ħ) = (ħ/4 - ħ/4) = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.



---------------

Wait, that's interesting. So the expectation value is zero. Then ⟨P_z⟩ squared is zero.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? Since P_z squared is (P_z)^2, which would be the square of each diagonal element. So the matrix P_z squared would have elements (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2 on the diagonal, so it's (ħ², 0, ħ²).

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is the sum of |ψ_i|^2 multiplied by (P_z)_{i,i}^2. 

---------------

Wait, no, P_z squared is just each diagonal element squared, so:

⟨P_z²⟩ = |ψ₁|² * (ħ)^2 + |ψ₂|² * 0 + |ψ₃|² * (ħ)^2.



---------------

Wait, because (P_z squared) is diagonal with entries (ħ^2, 0, ħ^2).

So substituting the values:

⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/4) * ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4) * ħ² = (ħ²/4 + ħ²/4) = ħ²/2.

So now, ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) = sqrt( (ħ²/2) - 0 ) = sqrt(ħ²/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).



---------------

Wait, that's one of the options. Let me look at the choices. Option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which matches.



---------------

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Because I've heard that when the expectation value is zero, the uncertainty is just the square root of the expectation of the square. So that seems right.

So the uncertainty ΔP_z is ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.
Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The operator $P_z$ is diagonal in the given basis, with diagonal elements $(\hbar, 0, -\hbar)$. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = | \psi_1 |^2 \cdot \hbar + | \psi_2 |^2 \cdot 0 + | \psi_3 |^2 \cdot (-\hbar),
\]

where $| \psi_1 |^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4$, $| \psi_2 |^2 = (1/\sqrt{2})^2 = 1/2$, and $| \psi_3 |^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4$. Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

Thus, $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$.

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is also diagonal, with diagonal elements $(\hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2)$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = | \psi_1 |^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + | \psi_2 |^2 \cdot 0 + | \psi_3 |^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \hbar^2 / 2$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\hbar / \sqrt{2}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

**Answer: B**
