Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to how much energy a planet absorbs and how much it emits. Since these planets are in orbital resonance and have circular orbits, their distances from the star must be key here.

The question says the planets are in a system where their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has the shortest period, then Planet_2 is twice that, Planet_3 is 2.5 times, and so on up to Planet_5. They also have the same albedo, which means the same reflectivity, so that shouldn't affect the calculation.



---------------

Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance, and the planet's albedo. The formula I remember is T = T_earth * sqrt(L/(16πσ)) * (1 - a)^(1/4) / d^(1/2), but maybe it's easier to think in terms of the inverse square law for energy. Oh right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * ( (1 - A)^(1/4) ) * ( L / (16πσ) )^(1/4) * (1/d)^(1/2) ), but perhaps a simpler way is to use the proportionality.

Since all planets orbit the same star, their T_star and L are the same. Albedo A is the same for all, so that cancels out. So the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star.



---------------

But wait, the orbital periods are given. How do I relate the period to the distance? Oh, Kepler's third law comes into play here. The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from the star). Since the orbits are circular, the semi-major axis is just the radius.

So, P² ∝ d³. Therefore, d ∝ P^(2/3). So the distance is proportional to the period raised to the 2/3 power.

But for the equilibrium temperature, which depends on 1/sqrt(d), we can substitute d in terms of P.

So, T ∝ 1 / sqrt(d) = 1 / sqrt( P^(2/3) ) = 1 / (P^(1/3)).



---------------

Wait, let me make that substitution correctly. Let me write it as T = k * (1 / sqrt(d)), where k is a constant. Since d ∝ P^(2/3), then sqrt(d) = (d)^(1/2) = (P^(2/3))^(1/2) = P^(1/3). So T ∝ 1 / (P^(1/3)).

So the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. So if Planet_4 has a period P4 and Planet_2 has P2, the ratio T4/T2 is (P2 / P4)^(1/3).



---------------

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Because T is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so T4 = k / (P4^(1/3)) and T2 = k / (P2^(1/3)). So the ratio T4/T2 would be [ (1/P4^(1/3)) ] / [ (1/P2^(1/3)) ] = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Yes, that's right. So the ratio is (P2/P4)^(1/3). Now, the given ratios are 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for the periods.



---------------

Wait, let me make sure about the planet designations. The periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planets 1 to 5. So Planet_1 has P1 = 1x, Planet_2 is 2x, Planet_3 is 2.5x, Planet_4 is 3.5x, and Planet_5 is 5x.

So, for Planet_4, P4 is 3.5x. Planet_2's P2 is 2x.

So the ratio T4/T2 is (P2/P4)^(1/3) = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3).



---------------

Wait, 2/3.5 is the same as 4/7, approximately 0.5714. So the cube root of 4/7.

What's 4/7? Let me compute 4 divided by 7. 4 ÷7 is approximately 0.5714. So cube root of 0.5714.

Cube of 0.8 is 0.512, which is a bit lower than 0.5714. Cube of 0.82 is 0.82^3 = approx 0.551368, still lower. 0.83^3 is 0.571787. Oh, that's very close to 0.5714.

So cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83. So the ratio T4/T2 is approximately 0.83.



---------------

Wait, but wait a second. Because the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance, which relates to the period via Kepler's law. So the formula is correct, but let me double-check the math.



---------------

Alternatively, let me compute (2/3.5)^(1/3) numerically.

3.5 is equal to 7/2. So 2/(7/2) = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

Cube root of 0.5714: Let me think about numbers. 0.8^3 is 0.512. 0.82^3 is about 0.82 * 0.82 = 0.6724, times 0.82 is around 0.551. 0.83^3: 0.83 *0.83 = 0.6889, multiplied by 0.83 gives 0.5717. So yeah, the cube root of 0.5714 is about 0.83.

So T4 is about 0.83 times T2. So the ratio T4/T2 is 0.83. So looking at the options, option C is ~0.83. So the answer should be C.



---------------

Wait, but wait another thing. Because in the equilibrium temperature formula, the temperature is proportional to (1 - A)^0.25 * (L/(16πσ))^0.5 * (1/d)^0.5. Or perhaps I should think in terms of T = T_sun * ( (1-A)^(1/4) ) * ( L )^(1/4) * (1/(d))^(1/2) * (1/(16πσ))^(1/4). 

---------------

Wait, maybe it's easier to use the inverse square law.

Wait, the formula I should use is T = T_star * sqrt( (1 - A) ) / (2 ) ) * (1/d)^0.5. 

---------------

Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula:

The equilibrium temperature T is given by:

T = T_earth * sqrt( (L / L_earth) ) * ( (1 - A) / (1 - A_earth) )^(1/4) * ( d_earth / d )^(1/2 )

But in this case, all planets are around the same star, so L is the same, and A is the same, so the ratio of their temperatures depends only on their distance.



---------------

Alternatively, I think the correct proportionality is T ∝ (1/d)^0.5. But wait, no, because T scales as (L/(16πσ d²))^(1/4), so T ∝ (1/d²)^(1/4) = (1/d)^0.5.



---------------

Wait, so T ∝ (1/d)^0.5. Since d is proportional to P^(2/3), then T ∝ (1/P^(2/3 * 0.5)) ) = (1/P^(1/3)).

So yes, T is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So my initial approach was correct.

So the ratio T4/T2 is (P2 / P4)^(1/3) = (2/3.5)^(1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83.

So the correct answer is option C, ~0.83.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital period. The equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star, \( d \), and Kepler's third law relates the orbital period \( P \) to the distance as \( d \propto P^{2/3} \). Substituting \( d \) into the temperature formula, we find \( T \propto P^{-1/3} \).

Given the orbital period ratios of the planets as \( 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \), Planet_2 has a period \( P_2 = 2x \) and Planet_4 has \( P_4 = 3.5x \). The ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_4} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{3.5} \right)^{1/3}.
\]

Simplifying \( \frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714 \), the cube root of \( 0.5714 \) is approximately \( 0.83 \). Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is \( T_4 / T_2 \approx 0.83 \).

From the options provided, the closest match is:

**A) ~0.57**  
**B) ~0.69**  
**C) ~0.83**  
**D) ~0.75**

The correct answer is **C) ~0.83**.
