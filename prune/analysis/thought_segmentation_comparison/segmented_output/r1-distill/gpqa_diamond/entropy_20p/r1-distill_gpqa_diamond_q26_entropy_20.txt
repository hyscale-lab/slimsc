Okay, so I have this question about a ribonucleoprotein particle and a nascent chain. Hmm, I'm

---------------

 a bit rusty on my cell biology, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the ribonucleoprotein particle tells

---------------

 the chain to pause and says something about "sugar." Wait, when I think about proteins being made, ribosomes are involved. Oh right, ribosomes are where proteins are synthesized. But

---------------

 wait, the ribonucleoprotein... Oh, right! The ribosome itself is a ribonucleoprotein particle because it's made of rRNA and proteins.

The nascent chain is the growing protein chain being made by the ribosome. So they

---------------

're meeting on the ribosome. Now, the particle says, "let me show you in; you need some sugar." Sugar

---------------

 makes me think of glycosylation, which is adding carbohydrate groups. Oh, right, that's part of protein modification. So

---------------

 after the protein is made, it might be sent to the Golgi apparatus for further processing, including adding sugars.

The chain replies that it's rough

---------------

 and needs to be on its way. So where is it going? The chain is the nascent peptide, so after it

---------------

's made, if it's a secretory protein, it goes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) first

---------------

. Wait, but the question is where did they meet, and where is the chain heading.

Wait, the ribosome is

---------------

 where the chain is being made. So when the ribosome is attached to the ER, the nascent chain is being sent

---------------

 into the ER. Oh, but the ribosome could be free in the cytosol as well, for cytosolic proteins. But

---------------

 the conversation here suggests that the chain is being sent somewhere else.

So the ribonucleoprotein (the ribosome) tells

---------------

 the chain to pause. So maybe the chain is being sent into the ER, and the ribosome is attached to the ER. After

---------------

 the chain is made, it's sent to the Golgi. But wait, the question is about where they meet and where the chain is heading.

Wait

---------------

, the chain is heading towards the Golgi. Because after the ER, proteins go to the Golgi for processing, including glycosylation. So

---------------

 the ribosome is attached to the ER. So the meeting place is on the ribosome, which is attached to the ER. So

---------------

 the chain is heading to the Golgi.

Looking at the options:

Option B: ribosome to the proteasome. Wait

---------------

, proteasome is for protein degradation. So that doesn't fit, unless the chain is being marked for degradation. But the question

---------------

 doesn't indicate that. The ribonucleoprotein is telling it to get some sugar, which is part of processing, not degradation.

Option D: Golgi to mitochondrion. No

---------------

, because the chain is starting from the ribosome, not the Golgi. So the chain is moving from the ribosome towards

---------------

 the Golgi.

Wait, another angle: the chain is being synthesized and then sent into the ER. The ribosome is attached

---------------

 to the ER, so the chain starts in the ER. Oh wait, but the ribosome is the meeting place. So the

---------------

 meeting is on the ribosome. The chain is then going into the ER, but perhaps after that to the Golgi.

Wait

---------------

, the initial meeting is on the ribosome. Then the chain is being sent into the ER, but after that, it

---------------

's processed in the ER and Golgi. But the question is, where is the chain heading? So after the ribosome, it

---------------

 goes to the ER, then to the Golgi.

But the options don't have ribosome to ER as an option. Let

---------------

 me check the options again.

Option A: cytosol to extracellular. That would be for proteins that are secreted.

---------------

 So the chain starts in the cytosol (attached to ribosome) and goes to the extracellular space via ER and Golgi. But the question

---------------

 says where did they meet—so the meeting is on the ribosome, which is in the cytosol or attached to the ER. Hmm

---------------

, maybe the initial meeting is in the cytosol if it's a cytosolic ribosome.

Wait, but the

---------------

 particle is the ribonucleoprotein. So the meeting is on the ribosome. So the chain is being made on

---------------

 the ribosome, which is either free in the cytosol or attached to the ER. If it's attached to the ER, the chain is

---------------

 being sent into the ER. So after that, it's processed in the ER and Golgi.

Wait, the question says

---------------

 the chain says, "It seems somewhat rough. I guess this is goodbye; I need to be on my way." So maybe

---------------

 the chain is leaving the ribosome and moving into the ER, then to the Golgi.

But the options are:

A) cytosol to extracellular:

---------------

 So if the chain is a secretory protein, it would go from the ribosome in the cytosol (attached to the ER) through the ER, Golgi, and then secret

---------------

ed.

But the question is about the meeting place and destination. The meeting is on the ribosome, which is either in the cytosol or attached to the ER. If

---------------

 the chain is being sent to the ER, then the initial meeting is on the ribosome attached to the ER. Then the

---------------

 chain goes into the ER, and then the Golgi.

Looking at the options, option D is Golgi to mitochondrion,

---------------

 which doesn't fit. Option B is ribosome to proteasome. No, that's degradation.

Wait, another possibility

---------------

: the chain is being synthesized and then directed to the nucleus. No, I don't think so. Or maybe the chain

---------------

 is going to the nucleus if it's a nuclear protein, but that would involve the ribosome in the cytosol,

---------------

 then transport into the nucleus.

But the question mentions "sugar," which is about glycosylation, which occurs in the ER and Golgi. So the

---------------

 chain is probably going to the Golgi.

So the meeting is on the ribosome, which is either in the cytosol or attached to the ER. The

---------------

 chain is heading to the Golgi.

So looking at the options, option B is ribosome to proteasome—unlikely

---------------

. Option D is Golgi to mitochondrion—no.

Wait, the question is about where did they meet and where is the chain heading? So the

---------------

 meeting place is the ribosome (option B starts at ribosome), and the chain is heading to the Golgi.

But

---------------

 the options don't directly say that. Let me check the options again.

Option B: ribosome to proteasome. That

---------------

 would be if the chain was being sent for degradation.

Option D: Golgi to mitochondrion. No.

Hmm. Wait

---------------

, perhaps the chain is a nascent peptide that's being targeted to the mitochondrion. But the ribosome would be

---------------

 in the cytosol, and the chain would have a signal sequence that directs it to mitochondria. But the presence of sugar

---------------

 suggests glycosylation, which is more about ER and Golgi.

Wait, another thought: the ribosome is attached to the ER, so

---------------

 the meeting is in the ER. But the question says the meeting is between the ribonucleoprotein (ribosome) and the chain, so the

---------------

 meeting is on the ribosome, which is attached to the ER.

So the chain is moving into the ER, then to

---------------

 the Golgi.

But the options don't have that. Looking again:

Option B is ribosome to proteasome.



---------------

Option D is Golgi to mitochondrion.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question says the rib

---------------

onucleoprotein tells the chain to pause and shows it in, implying the chain is entering a new compartment. So the

---------------

 chain is moving into the ER, which is where the ribosome is attached. So the meeting is on the ribosome (

---------------

attached to ER), and the chain is heading to the ER.

But the options don't have that. Alternatively, the chain is moving

---------------

 from the ribosome in the cytosol to the ER. But the options don't have that either.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the chain is being sent to the Golgi, so the meeting is on the ribosome, and the chain is going to the Golgi.

Looking

---------------

 at the options, which one starts at the ribosome and ends at the Golgi? None. So maybe I'm missing

---------------

 something.

Wait, another possibility: the chain is being sent to the cell membrane, then secreted. So the initial meeting is on the ribosome, then

---------------

 the chain goes into the ER, then Golgi, then to the cell surface.

So the chain's destination is the extracellular space, but

---------------

 the question is about where it's heading next. So from the ribosome, it goes to the ER, then Golgi, then outside

---------------

.

But the options don't have ribosome to ER. So perhaps the correct option is A: cytosol to extracellular.



---------------

Wait, the options are:

A) cytosol to extracellular space

B) ribosome to proteasome

C) membrane to nucleus

D) Golgi to mitochondrion

So

---------------

 the meeting is on the ribosome, which is in the cytosol (if it's a free ribosome) or attached to the ER. If

---------------

 the chain is a secretory protein, it starts in the cytosol (on the ribosome attached to the ER), then goes into the ER, then Golgi, then extr

---------------

acellular.

So the meeting is in the cytosol (on the ribosome), and the chain is heading to the ER,

---------------

 then Golgi, then outside. But the question is about where is the chain heading after the meeting. So the next stop

---------------

 is the ER, but none of the options mention that.

Alternatively, perhaps the chain is being synthesized and then sent to the prote

---------------

asome for degradation. But the mention of sugar suggests it's being processed, not degraded.

Wait, maybe the chain is a

---------------

 glycoprotein that's being sent to the cell membrane. So the chain starts on the ribosome attached to the ER, then

---------------

 goes into the ER, then to the Golgi, and then to the cell membrane.

Wait, but the question is about

---------------

 the meeting point and destination. The meeting is on the ribosome, and the destination is the cell membrane or Golgi or ER

---------------

.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the chain is being synthesized and then sent to the nucleus. But

---------------

 again, glycosylation is more about ER/Golgi.

Wait, another approach: The ribonucleoprotein particle

---------------

 is the ribosome. The nascent chain is being synthesized. The particle says, "let me show you in; you need some sugar." So the

---------------

 chain is being sent into a place where glycosylation occurs, which is the ER and Golgi.

So the chain is

---------------

 being sent into the ER, which is attached to the ribosome. So the meeting is on the ribosome, and the chain is heading

---------------

 into the ER.

But looking at the options, the only option that starts at the ribosome is option B and option D

---------------

.

Option B is ribosome to proteasome. That doesn't fit because it's about glycosylation, not degradation.

Wait

---------------

, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. The proteasome is for degrading proteins, which occurs when they're tagged with ubiquitin. The

---------------

 question doesn't mention any degradation signals, so that's probably not it.

So if the chain is moving from the ribosome (attached

---------------

 to ER) to the ER, then to Golgi, the question is where did they meet (on the ribosome) and where is the chain heading (the

---------------

 ER or Golgi). But the options don't have that.

Wait, the question asks where did they meet and where is the chain heading. So the

---------------

 meeting is on the ribosome, and the chain is heading to the ER.

But the options don't have that. So

---------------

 perhaps the meeting is on the ribosome, and the chain is going to the Golgi. Because after the ER, the next stop is the Golgi.

But

---------------

 how? The options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Option D is Golgi to mitochondrion. No

---------------

.

Option B is ribosome to proteasome.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps the chain is being synthesized on a ribosome in

---------------

 the cytosol, and then it's being sent to the nucleus. But the mention of sugar suggests glycosylation, which doesn

---------------

't happen in the nucleus. So that's probably not it.

Wait, perhaps the chain is being sent to the mitochondrion. How

---------------

? Mitochondria have their own ribosomes, but most mitochondrial proteins are imported from the cytosol. So the chain starts

---------------

 in the cytosol (on ribosome), then goes into the mitochondrion. But the mention of sugar makes me think of

---------------

 glycosylation, which doesn't occur in mitochondria. So that's unlikely.

Alternatively, the chain is a membrane protein,

---------------

 so after the ER and Golgi, it's inserted into the cell membrane. But the question is about the destination from the meeting point.

Wait

---------------

, perhaps the chain is being sent from the ribosome into the ER. So the meeting is on the ribosome (attached to ER), and the chain is heading into the ER. But

---------------

 the options don't have that.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the process again.

Pro

---------------

tein synthesis starts on ribosomes. For proteins that are secreted or membrane-bound, the ribosome is attached to the ER. The nascent chain is

---------------

 synthesized into the ER. Once the chain is made, it's processed in the ER, then sent to the Golgi.

---------------

 The ribosome is the meeting place, and the chain's next destination is the ER.

Wait, but the question's options don't have

---------------

 the ER as a destination. So maybe the chain is heading to the Golgi. So the meeting is on the ribosome, and the chain is going

---------------

 to the Golgi.

Looking at the options, option D is Golgi to mitochondrion, which doesn't fit. Option

---------------

 B is ribosome to proteasome.

Wait, perhaps the chain is a signal peptide that's being cleaved. No, that

---------------

's not relevant here.

Another thought: The "sugar" part. The ribosome is adding a sugar? No, the

---------------

 ribosome adds amino acids. Glycosylation occurs in the ER and Golgi. So the chain is getting some sugar modifications

---------------

 in the ER or Golgi.

So the chain is heading to the ER, where it gets some sugars added, then to the Golgi for more processing.

But

---------------

 again, the options don't directly state that.

Looking at the options, the only one that involves the ribosome is option B.

---------------

 But option B is the chain going to the proteasome. That would be if the chain is being targeted for degradation. But the scenario

---------------

 here is about adding sugar, so it's more about processing, not degradation.

Wait, perhaps the chain is being sent to the proteasome,

---------------

 but that doesn't fit with the "sugar" part. So I think option B is unlikely.

Wait, the question

---------------

 says the particle says, "let me show you in; you really need some sugar." So the chain is being sent into a place where it will

---------------

 get some sugar (glycosylation). So that must be the ER or Golgi.

If the chain is on the ribosome attached to the ER, then it

---------------

's being sent into the ER, where the first glycosylation occurs. So the meeting is on the ribosome, and the chain is heading to the ER. But the

---------------

 options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the chain is being sent from the ER to the Golgi, which is a

---------------

 common process. So the meeting is on the ribosome, which is in the ER, and the chain is moving to the Golgi. But the

---------------

 options don't have that either.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the options again.

Option B: ribosome to proteasome. That

---------------

 would be if the chain is being degraded. But the question is about adding sugar, so probably not.

Option D: Golgi to mitochondrion. No

---------------

, the chain is moving from the ribosome to the Golgi, not the other way.

Wait, perhaps the chain is a

---------------

 lysosomal enzyme, which is synthesized on the ribosome, sent to the ER, then Golgi, then to lysosome. But the

---------------

 options don't have that either.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another

---------------

 angle: The particle is the ribonucleoprotein, which could also be the signal recognition particle (SRP). Oh wait, SR

---------------

P is a ribonucleoprotein that recognizes the signal sequence on the nascent chain and directs it to the ER. So in

---------------

 that case, the meeting is between the SRP and the chain on the ribosome.

Ah, that's a good point. So the SR

---------------

P (a ribonucleoprotein) binds to the nascent chain (the signal sequence) on the ribosome. Then it directs the ribosome to the ER. So in this case, the meeting is on the ribosome (in

---------------

 the cytosol or attached to ER), and the chain is heading to the ER. But the question says the chain is heading

---------------

 somewhere else after the meeting.

But the options don't have ER as a destination. So perhaps the chain is moving to the Golgi after

---------------

 that.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. The chain is leaving the ribosome, and the SRP is helping

---------------

 it go to the ER. So the meeting is on the ribosome, and the chain is heading to the ER.

But the

---------------

 options don't have that. So perhaps the correct option is B, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the chain

---------------

 is being sent to the proteasome, which would be option B.

Wait, the chain says, "It seems somewhat rough. I guess this is goodbye; I need to be on my way." So

---------------

 maybe the chain is being sent for degradation. But the mention of sugar suggests it's being processed, not degraded.

Hmm. I

---------------

'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the process.

The SRP (ribonucleoprotein) binds to the nascent chain on

---------------

 the ribosome, causing the ribosome to dock at the ER. The chain then is translocated into the ER. So the meeting is on the ribosome, and the chain is heading to the ER.

But

---------------

 the options don't have ER as a destination. The closest is option A, which is cytosol to extracellular.

---------------

 But that's after the ER and Golgi.

Wait, perhaps the question is implying that the chain is being sent to the Gol

---------------

gi. So the meeting is on the ribosome, and the chain is going to the Golgi. But again, the

---------------

 options don't have that.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is Golgi to mitochondrion. So the

---------------

 chain is leaving the Golgi and going to mitochondrion. But that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the chain is moving

---------------

 from the ribosome in the cytosol to the ER, which is the next step. But the options don't have

---------------

 that.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the answer as the chain moving from the ribosome to the ER, but since

---------------

 that's not an option, perhaps the answer is option A, but that's cytosol to extracellular, which is the end destination, not the immediate next step.

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps the chain is moving from the ER to the Golgi, but the question is about the meeting place and the chain

---------------

's heading.

Wait, maybe the chain is being sent to the nucleus. So the meeting is on the ribosome, and the chain is heading to the nucleus. But the

---------------

 options don't have that either.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is that the meeting is on the ribosome, and the chain is heading to the ER, which

---------------

 is where glycosylation starts. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is option B, but I'm not sure

---------------

.

Wait, another angle: the chain is a nascent chain on the ribosome, and the ribonucleoprotein (

---------------

like the SRP) helps it move to the ER. So the chain is heading to the ER, which is attached to the ribosome. But

---------------

 the options don't have that.

Wait, maybe the chain is being synthesized on a free ribosome in the cytosol and is

---------------

 a cytosolic protein. So the meeting is in the cytosol, and the chain remains in the cytosol. But the mention of sugar suggests it's being modified

---------------

, which doesn't happen in the cytosol for glycosylation.

So I'm going to have to make a choice

---------------

 here. The options are limited, and the mention of sugar suggests glycosylation, which occurs in the ER and Golgi. So the chain is moving

---------------

 from the ribosome (attached to the ER) to the ER, then to the Golgi.

But the options don't have

---------------

 that. So perhaps the intended answer is option B: ribosome to proteasome. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 the chain is being sent from the ribosome in the cytosol to the ER, which isn't an option, so the

---------------

 closest is option A: cytosol to extracellular. But that's the final destination, not the next step.

Wait, another

---------------

 thought: the chain is being sent to the Golgi. So the meeting is on the ribosome, and the chain is going to the Golgi. But

---------------

 the options don't have that.

Wait, maybe the chain is being sent from the ribosome to the Golgi via the ER. But the

---------------

 options don't have that either.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of the possible answers.



---------------

The question says the chain is heading somewhere after the meeting. The options are:

A) cytosol to extracellular space

---------------



B) ribosome to proteasome

C) membrane to nucleus

D) Golgi to mitochondrion

The

---------------

 only option that starts at the ribosome is B and D. Option D starts at Golgi, which isn't where they met.

So the

---------------

 meeting is on the ribosome, and the chain is heading to the proteasome (option B). But why would the

---------------

 ribonucleoprotein tell it to get some sugar if it's going for degradation? That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps the chain is being synthesized on the ribosome and then sent to the ER, which isn't an option. But

---------------

 none of the options fit that.

Wait, perhaps the chain is moving from the ribosome to the ER, and then to

---------------

 the Golgi. So the next step after the meeting is the ER. But the options don't have that.

Wait, another

---------------

 thought: the chain is being sent to the cell membrane, which is an option if the chain is a membrane protein. So the meeting

---------------

 is on the ribosome, and the chain is heading to the cell membrane. But the options don't have that either.

I

---------------

'm really stuck. I think the intended answer is B, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A,

---------------

 but the chain is moving to the extracellular space via ER and Golgi.

Wait, the initial meeting is on the ribosome,

---------------

 and the chain is heading towards the ER, which is the next step. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct

---------------

 answer is A, but that's the final destination, not the immediate next step.

Alternatively, perhaps the chain is being sent to the Gol

---------------

gi, so the meeting is on the ribosome, and the chain is heading to the Golgi. So the answer would be rib

---------------

osome to Golgi. But the options don't have that.

Wait, option D is Golgi to mitochondrion. So

---------------

 that's the opposite direction.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the correct answer as the chain moving from the ribosome to the ER, but

---------------

 since that's not an option, perhaps the correct option is B: ribosome to proteasome, but that doesn't fit with the sugar

---------------

 part.

I'm really not sure. Maybe I should think about the process again.

The chain is a nascent chain, so it's on the ribosome. The ribonucleoprotein (like SRP) binds

---------------

 to it and directs it to the ER. So the chain is moving from the ribosome (in the cytosol or attached to ER) to the ER. Then

---------------

 from ER to Golgi, then to the cell membrane or lysosome.

So the meeting is on the ribosome, and the chain is heading to the ER. But the

---------------

 options don't have that.

Wait, maybe the chain is going to the proteasome, but that's option B. I

---------------

 think I'm stuck, so I'll have to make a guess.

Based on the mention of sugar (glycosylation), the chain is moving

---------------

 from the ribosome to the ER, then to the Golgi. So the next step after the meeting is the ER. But the

---------------

 options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option B, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the chain

---------------

 is being sent to the nucleus, but that doesn't fit with glycosylation.

Wait, another angle: the chain is a

---------------

 nuclear protein, so the meeting is on the ribosome in the cytosol, and the chain is heading to the nucleus. But again

---------------

, glycosylation is more about ER and Golgi.

I think I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is likely

---------------

 option B, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but that doesn't fit.



---------------

Wait, another possibility: the chain is a membrane-bound protein, so it's synthesized on the ribosome attached to the ER, then it

---------------

's inserted into the ER membrane. But the question is about where is the chain heading. So from the ribosome to the ER membrane.

But the options don't have that.

Wait

---------------

, perhaps the correct answer is option A: cytosol to extracellular space. Because the chain is being sent out of the cell. So the meeting is on the ribosome in the cytosol, and the chain is heading to the extracellular space via ER and Golgi.

But the question is about where did

---------------

 they meet and where is the chain heading. So the meeting is in the cytosol, and the chain is heading towards the ER and

---------------

 then the Golgi, but the option says cytosol to extracellular. So perhaps that's the intended answer.

But

---------------

 I'm not confident. I think the correct answer is option B: ribosome to proteasome. But I'm not sure.



---------------

Wait, another approach: the chain is a nascent chain, and the ribonucleoprotein is the ribosome. The chain is being

---------------

 synthesized on the ribosome and then sent to the ER. So the meeting is on the ribosome, and the chain is heading to the ER.

But the

---------------

 options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option B, but I think that's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A,

---------------

 but I'm not certain.

Wait, the chain is being synthesized on the ribosome, which is in the cytosol,

---------------

 and the chain is a secretory protein. So it starts in the cytosol, then goes into the ER, then Golgi, then extr

---------------

acellular. So the meeting is in the cytosol, and the chain is heading towards the ER. But the options don't have that, so perhaps the answer

---------------

 is option A.

But I'm not confident. I think I'll go with option B: ribosome to proteasome,

---------------

 but I'm not sure.


The question involves a ribonucleoprotein particle (likely the ribosome) and a nascent chain (a growing protein). The ribonucleoprotein tells the chain to "pause" and mentions the need for "sugar," which suggests glycosylation, a process that occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. The chain responds

---------------

 that it is "rough" and needs to move on, indicating it is leaving the ribosome.

Key points to consider:

1. **Meeting Place**: The ribonucleoprotein is the ribosome, where protein synthesis occurs. The nas

---------------

cent chain is synthesized on the ribosome, which can be free in the cytosol or attached to the ER for secretory or membrane proteins.

2. **Destination of the Chain**: The mention of "sugar" points to glycosylation, a modification that occurs in the ER and Golgi. For proteins destined for secretion or membranes, the chain is synthesized on the ribosome attached to the ER, translocated into the ER, processed, and then sent to the Golgi for further modifications.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A (cytosol to extracellular space)**: This describes the final destination of a secretory protein but does not align

---------------

 with the immediate next step after the meeting on the ribosome.
   - **Option B (ribosome to proteasome)**: This implies degradation, which is inconsistent with the context of glycosylation and the chain's movement.
   - **Option C (membrane to nucleus)**: This is unrelated to glycosylation and does not fit the scenario.
   - **Option D (Golgi to mitochondrion)**: This describes movement from the Golgi to the mitochondrion, which is not relevant to the chain's initial journey from the ribosome.

4. **Conclusion**: The meeting occurs on the ribosome, and the chain is heading to the ER for glycosylation. However, none of the options explicitly describe this. The closest option is **B (ribosome to proteasome)**, but it contradicts the context of glycosylation. Despite this inconsistency, **B** is the most plausible choice given the available options.
