Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about nucleon systems emitting a particle. Hmm, let me read the question again.



---------------

Alright, the question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. The

---------------

 Pauli statistics condition says that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Oh

---------------

 wait, T is the isospin, S is the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum of the NN system.

---------------

 

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So I need to find which partial wave is not permitted based

---------------

 on conservation laws.

First, I should probably figure out what the initial state is. The initial state is 1S0. The

---------------

 term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So for 1S0, 2S+1 = 1 implies

---------------

 S=0. The L is S, so L=0, and J is 0. So initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

The

---------------

 system emits a particle X. So the initial state is NN in 1S0, and after emitting X, the NN

---------------

 state must be in some other state. Let's denote the final state as T, L, S.

Wait, but the

---------------

 problem says the final NN state has T(NN)=0. So the isospin is 0. 

The Paul

---------------

i statistics condition given is T = S + L +1 mod 2. Since T is 0, that equation becomes 0 ≡ S + L + 1 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2. So S and L must have opposite parities.

---------------

 If S is even, L is odd, and vice versa.

Now, the parity of the final state must be considered.

---------------

 Because parity is conserved in strong interactions, but wait, particle emission can change the parity based on the emitted particle's parity. Wait

---------------

, parity conservation in strong interactions? Hmm, but the problem says to consider both parity and angular momentum conservation.

The initial parity is

---------------

 for the NN system. The parity of a state is given by (-1)^L. Since the initial state is 1S0, L=0 → parity is 

---------------

1.

After emission, the parity of the NN system must be such that the initial parity equals the product of the parity of the emitted

---------------

 particle and the parity of the final state. Because parity is conserved (assuming the interaction is parity-conserving, which I

---------------

 think is the case here since it's a strong interaction process), but wait, the emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So

---------------

 the parity of the final state multiplied by the parity of X should equal the initial parity.

Wait, the parity of the initial

---------------

 state is P_initial = (-1)^L_initial. L_initial is 0, so P_initial = 1.

The parity

---------------

 after emission would be P_final = (-1)^{L_final} multiplied by the parity of the emitted particle X, which is -1. So P

---------------

_initial = P_final * parity(X) → 1 = P_final * (-1) → P_final = -1.

So the parity of the final NN state is -1. Therefore

---------------

, (-1)^{L_final} = -1 → L_final must be odd.

So L_final is odd. So

---------------

 possible L_final values are 1, 3, 5, etc.

Now, from the Pauli condition, T

---------------

=0. So S + L must be odd (since 0 ≡ S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L ≡1 mod 2).

We

---------------

 have L_final is odd, so S must be even for their sum to be odd. Because odd (L) + even (S) = odd.



---------------

So S_final must be even. What are the possible S values? S can be 0,1,2,... but

---------------

 for two nucleons, the possible total spin states are S=0 (singlet) or S=1 (triplet). So

---------------

 in the final state, S_final can be 0 or 1.

But wait, since S must be even, and

---------------

 S can be 0 or 1, the only possibility is S=0. Because 0 is even and 1 is odd. So S_final =

---------------

0.

So now, the final state has S=0, L is odd.

But wait, the two nucleons can

---------------

 have spin S=0 or S=1. So in the final state, S=0. So the isospin T is

---------------

 0, which is given.

Now, the problem asks about the partial waves of the emitted particle. The options give different

---------------

 emitted particles (like p, which is a pseudoscalar?), but wait, the options are about the angular momentum state of X.

---------------

 Each option gives the term symbol of the final NN state and the emitted particle's state.

Wait, the options are of the form 

---------------

1S0 → something + something. So the initial state is 1S0, and the final NN state is something

---------------

, and X is emitted in a certain state.

Wait, no, perhaps the options are the possible transitions. For example, option

---------------

 A is 1S0 →7D1 + p. So the NN goes from 1S0 to 7D1, and emits

---------------

 a p (proton?), which is in state p (probably p-wave? Or the letter denotes the orbital angular momentum).

---------------

 Hmm, the question says the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X. So 'p' is probably the orbital angular momentum quantum

---------------

 number. So for example, the emitted particle is in an l=1 state (p-wave), etc.

Wait, the

---------------

 notation is: initial state (1S0) → final state (like 7D1) plus particle X in state

---------------

 p. So the final NN state is 7D1, and X is emitted in a p (l=1) state.

I

---------------

 need to check each option to see if it's allowed under the conservation laws. The problem says to consider both angular momentum and parity.

So

---------------

 for each option, let's analyze.

The initial state has L_initial=0, S_initial=0, J_initial=0.

After

---------------

 emission, the final NN state has L_final, S_final=0, T_final=0.

The emitted particle X has its

---------------

 own orbital angular momentum, say l. And its spin. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify spin, so perhaps we

---------------

're considering only orbital angular momentum for X.

Wait, the problem says 'the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J),

---------------

 where S is total spin, L is orbital angular momentum, and J is total angular momentum.'

So in the options, the

---------------

 first part is the final NN state's term symbol, and the second is the emitted X's angular momentum state, which I

---------------

 think refers to its orbital angular momentum l.

So for each option, the final NN state is given, and X is emitted with a

---------------

 certain l.

We need to ensure that:

1. Angular momentum is conserved: The initial angular momentum J_initial (which is 0) must equal the sum of the final NN's J and X's J

---------------

. But wait, J_initial is 0, so the sum of the final J's must be 0. So J

---------------

_NN_final + J_X =0. But J can't be negative, so both must be zero. Wait, that

---------------

 can't be unless both J's are zero.

Wait, no. Wait, in a decay process, the total angular momentum must

---------------

 be conserved. The initial total J is 0, so the sum of the J of the final NN and X must be 0. So

---------------

 their J's must be such that their vector sum is zero. Which means J_NN and J_X must have the same magnitude but opposite directions. But

---------------

 since J is a non-negative integer, the only way their vector sum is zero is if both J's are zero. Because

---------------

 if one is non-zero, the other can't have the same magnitude but opposite direction if it's a non-negative integer.

Wait, but

---------------

 wait. Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The initial J is 0. So the sum of the final

---------------

 J's (NN and X) must be 0. So their total angular momentum must be zero. But since angular momentum is a vector quantity, this

---------------

 implies that J_NN and J_X must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. But since J is quantized,

---------------

 the only way for this to happen is if both J's are zero. Because you can't have a spin in opposite directions if

---------------

 their magnitudes are non-zero integers.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because J is a vector, and for the

---------------

 sum to be zero, the vectors must cancel each other. So the magnitudes can be the same, and their directions opposite. But

---------------

 J must be integer values, so for example, J_NN could be 1 and J_X could be 1, but

---------------

 with opposite orientations. But in terms of quantum numbers, this is possible only if the total J is 0. But wait

---------------

, when adding two angular momenta, you can get a total J=0 only if their sum is possible. So for

---------------

 example, if J_NN is 1 and J_X is 1, the possible total J could be 0,1,2. So it

---------------

's possible for the total to be zero. So that would require the initial J to be zero, which it is. So perhaps

---------------

 the process is allowed.

But wait, the problem says that the initial state has J=0. So the sum of the final

---------------

 J's must be zero. So J_NN + J_X must be zero, which implies that J_NN and J_X are

---------------

 such that their vector sum is zero. So the only way this can happen is if both J's are zero, or if

---------------

 they're non-zero but in opposite directions, but I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, perhaps I should approach

---------------

 this differently. The initial angular momentum is zero, so the total angular momentum after emission must be zero. So the sum of the angular

---------------

 momenta of the NN system and the emitted X must be zero. But angular momentum addition is a vector addition, so the

---------------

 only way their sum is zero is if their J's are such that they can combine to zero. So for example, J_NN and

---------------

 J_X must be such that |J_NN - J_X| ≤ 0 ≤ J_NN + J_X. So

---------------

 J_NN = J_X, and their directions are opposite. But since J is a non-negative integer, the only way

---------------

 for their vector sum to be zero is if both are zero, or if they have the same magnitude but opposite directions, but in

---------------

 quantum mechanics, that's a bit tricky because of the possible values.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to consider that the initial

---------------

 state has J=0, so the total J after must also be 0. So the possible J's of the final NN and X must combine

---------------

 to 0. But this can happen only if their J's are such that J_NN = J_X and their spins

---------------

 are opposite. But since spin is quantized, this isn't straightforward. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps we

---------------

 should think in terms of orbital angular momentum only, considering that spin might complicate things. Wait, but the problem says to

---------------

 use conservation of both angular momentum and parity.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed step by step for each option, checking the conditions

---------------

.

First, let me note down the initial state and the conditions:

- Initial state: 1S0 → S=0, L=0, J=0.


---------------

- Emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1.
- Final NN state: T=0 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2 →

---------------

 since L is odd (from parity condition), S must be even. But for two nucleons, S can only be 0 or 1. So S must

---------------

 be 0.
- So final state has S=0, L is odd (1,3,5...), and J is

---------------

 to be determined.

Now, the parity condition: the parity of the initial state is 1. After emission, the parity is

---------------

 P_NN * P_X. So P_initial = P_NN * P_X → 1 = (-1)^{L_final} * (-1)^

---------------

{l_X}, where l_X is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of X.

Because the parity of X is given as -1, which

---------------

 is (-1)^{l_X + s_X}, but for a spin-0 particle, it's (-1)^l. Wait

---------------

, but particles like pions are pseudoscalar (l=0, s=0 → parity -1). But I

---------------

'm not sure about the spin of X. The problem says X has intrinsic parity -1, but doesn't specify its spin. Hmm

---------------

, but perhaps since the options only give the orbital angular momentum state (like p, s, etc.), maybe we're to

---------------

 assume that X's spin is 0, so that its parity is (-1)^l.

Wait, the problem says the

---------------

 term symbol of X is given by the lowercase letter, which denotes the angular momentum state. So perhaps X is a pseudoscalar (

---------------

like a pion), so l=0 and spin 0, making parity (-1)^0 * (-1)^0 = 1?

---------------

 Wait, no, because a pion is a pseudoscalar, which has parity -1. So perhaps X has l=0 and spin 0,

---------------

 but then parity would be (-1)^0 * (-1)^0 = 1, which doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 X is a spin-1/2 particle, but that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the parity is given as -

---------------

1 regardless of l, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem says that the intrinsic parity of X is -1. So the

---------------

 parity of X is -1, regardless of its orbital angular momentum. So the parity of X is (-1)^{l_X + s_X} = -1. But

---------------

 without knowing s_X, it's tricky. Hmm, but perhaps the problem is considering only the orbital part, assuming that the spin doesn

---------------

't contribute to the parity. Or perhaps X is a spin-0 particle, so s_X=0, making the parity (-1)^{l_X} = -1 → l_X must be odd.

---------------

 Or if X is a spin-1 particle, then l_X +1 must be odd, so l_X even.

Wait

---------------

, maybe the problem is considering X as a spin-0 particle, so that its parity is (-1)^l_X. Because

---------------

 then, given that P_X is -1, (-1)^l_X = -1 → l_X is odd. So X

---------------

 has l=1,3,5... So for the parity condition, the parity of the NN system after emission is (-

---------------

1)^{L_final} * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{L_final + l_X}.

But

---------------

 earlier, we determined that P_NN_final must be -1 because initial parity is 1, and X's parity is -1,

---------------

 so 1 = (-1) * P_NN_final → P_NN_final = -1. So (-1)^{L_final} = -1 → L_final is odd.

So

---------------

 now, for each option, the emitted X has a certain l_X. Let's check each option:

Option A: 1S0 →7D1 + p



---------------

So the final NN state is 7D1. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). Here, S

---------------

=0 (since it's 1D... Wait, 7D1 → (2S+1)=7 → S=3,

---------------

 because 2*3+1=7. So S=3, L=D=2 (since S=0 is

---------------

 S, P=1, D=2, F=3, etc.), so L=2. Then J=1.

Wait, wait

---------------

, 7D1: (2S+1)=7 → S=3. L is D → L=2. J is 1.

So

---------------

 in the final state, S=3, L=2. But earlier, from the Pauli condition, the final state must have S=0 because

---------------

 T=0 and L is odd. So in this case, L=2 is even. Which contradicts our earlier conclusion that L must be odd. Because from

---------------

 the parity, L_final must be odd.

So this option's final NN state has L=2, which is even. Which

---------------

 doesn't satisfy the parity condition, so this transition is not allowed. So option A is not permitted. But let me check

---------------

 other options too.

Wait, no, because the initial state is 1S0, and the final state is 7D1.

---------------

 So S_final=3, which is odd. Earlier, we thought that S_final must be even (0). So this

---------------

 is a contradiction. So this option is not allowed.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. The final state must

---------------

 have T=0. So the Pauli condition says T = S + L +1 mod 2. For T=0, S + L must be 1 mod 2.

---------------

 So S and L must be opposite in parity.

In option A, the final state has S=3 (which is odd), L=2 (even). So S+

---------------

L is odd + even = odd → 1 mod 2. So the condition holds. But the parity of the NN state is

---------------

 (-1)^L = (-1)^2 = 1. But earlier, we determined that the parity of the NN must

---------------

 be -1. Because initial parity is 1, X has parity -1, so 1 = (-1) * P_NN → P_NN = -1 → (-1)^{L_final} = -1 → L_final must be odd. But in option A, L_final=2,

---------------

 which is even. So this violates the parity condition.

So this option can't be allowed because the parity of the final NN state is

---------------

 positive, but it should be negative.

So option A is not allowed.

Option B: 1S0 →3S1 + p

Final

---------------

 NN state: 3S1. (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is S → L=0 (since S state

---------------

 is L=0). J=1.

So S_final=1 (odd), L=0 (even). S+L=1,

---------------

 which is 1 mod 2. So the Pauli condition holds.

Parity of NN: (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = 1. But earlier

---------------

, the parity must be -1. So this violates the parity condition. So this option is not allowed.

Wait, but wait

---------------

, what about the emitted particle's l? Let's think. The emitted X has state p, which I think refers to l=1.

---------------

 So l_X=1.

So the parity condition is P_NN * P_X = P_initial → (-1)^{L_final} * (-1)^{l_X} = 1 →

---------------

 (-1)^{L_final + l_X} = 1.

In option B, L_final=0, l_X=1 → 

---------------

0+1=1 → (-1)^1 = -1 ≠1. So this doesn't satisfy the parity condition. So this

---------------

 option is not allowed.

Option C: 1S0 →3D3 + f

Final NN state: 3D3 → (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L=D → L=2. J=3.

So

---------------

 S=1 (odd), L=2 (even). S+L=3 → 1 mod 2. So Pauli condition holds.

Parity of NN: (-1)^2 = 1. But

---------------

 required is -1. So parity condition is not met. So this option is invalid.

Wait, but the emitted X has

---------------

 state f, which I think is l=3.

So P_NN * P_X = (-1)^{L_final} * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^2 * (-1)^3 = (1)*(-1) = -1. Which

---------------

 equals the initial parity (1) only if 1 * (-1) = 1 → which is not true. Because

---------------

 1 * (-1) = -1, which doesn't equal the initial 1. So this doesn't satisfy the parity condition. So option C is invalid.

Option D: 1S0 →3P0 + s

Final NN state: 3P0 → (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L=P → L=1. J=0.

So S=1 (odd), L=1 (odd). S+L=2 → 0 mod 2. So the

---------------

 Pauli condition would require T=0 → 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L must

---------------

 be 1 mod 2. Here, S+L=2 → 0 mod 2. So condition doesn't hold. So this option is

---------------

 not allowed.

Wait, but wait, the Pauli condition is T = S + L +1 mod 2. T

---------------

 is 0, so 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L =1 mod 2. In

---------------

 this case, S=1, L=1 → sum is 2 → 0 mod 2. So condition not

---------------

 met. So option D is invalid.

Wait, but let me check the parity condition. L_final=1, so (-

---------------

1)^1 = -1. X's state is 's' → l=0.

So P_NN * P_X = (-1)^1 * (-1)^0 = (-1)*(

---------------

1) = -1. But initial parity is 1. So 1 = (-1)*(-1) → 1=1. So

---------------

 parity condition holds.

But the Pauli condition doesn't hold because S+L=2 → 0 mod 2. So T

---------------

 would be 0 = 0 +1 mod 2 → 1 mod 2? No, because T=0.

---------------

 So condition not met.

So which options are invalid? Let's recap:

Option A: L=2 (even), so

---------------

 parity condition not met. So invalid.

Option B: L=0, parity condition not met. Invalid.

Option C: L=2, parity condition not met. Invalid.

Option D: Paul

---------------

i condition not met, but parity holds.

Wait, but the problem asks which partial wave is not permitted. So which options

---------------

 are invalid based on conservation laws.

Wait, the options are possible emission processes. So we need to find which of these is

---------------

 not allowed.

From the parity condition, the final NN state must have L=odd, and the emitted X must have l such that (-1)^L_final * (-1)^l_X = 1 (

---------------

since initial parity is 1, and X's parity is (-1)^{l_X + s_X}, but perhaps for

---------------

 simplicity, we're assuming X is spin-0, so parity is (-1)^l_X. So the condition is (-1)^{L_final} * (-1)^{l_X} = 1 → L_final + l_X must be even.

Because

---------------

 initial parity is 1, and P_initial = P_NN * P_X → 1 = (-1)^{L_final} * (-1)^{l_X} → (-1)^{L_final + l_X} =1 → L_final + l_X must be even.

So

---------------

 for each option:

Option A: L_final=2 (even), l_X=p=1. Sum is 3, odd. So

---------------

 parity condition not met.

Option B: L_final=0 (even), l_X=1. Sum 1 → odd. Not

---------------

 met.

Option C: L_final=2, l_X=3 (f). Sum 5 → odd. Not met.

Option D: L_final=1 (odd), l_X=0 (s). Sum 1 → odd. Not

---------------

 met.

Wait, all options have L_final + l_X odd, which would imply that the parity condition is not met, which

---------------

 can't be right. Because that would mean all options are invalid, but the question says one is not permitted.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I made a mistake. Let me re-express the parity condition correctly.

The initial parity is 1. The parity after emission is P_NN_final * P_X.

---------------

 Since X has intrinsic parity -1, and assuming that X's parity is (-1)^{l_X + s_X}, but if

---------------

 we're to ignore spin, perhaps X's parity is (-1)^{l_X}.

But the problem says the intrinsic parity of X is -1. So the

---------------

 parity of X is -1, regardless of l. So the condition becomes:

P_initial = P_NN_final * P_X → 1 = (-1)^{L_final} * (-1)

---------------

 → (-1)^{L_final} = -1 → L_final is odd.

So L_final must be odd.

Now

---------------

, for each option:

Option A: L_final=2 → even → invalid.

Option B: L_final=0 → even → invalid.

Option C: L_final=2 → even → invalid.

Option D: L_final=1 → odd → valid.

---------------

 So the parity condition is met.

So only option D meets the parity condition. But we also need to check the Pauli condition.



---------------

In option D: L_final=1 (odd), S_final=1 (since term is 3P0 → S=1).

---------------

 So S + L = 1 +1=2 → 0 mod 2. Pauli condition is T= S + L +1 mod 2 → T=0=

---------------

0+1 mod 2 → 1 mod 2 → which is not correct. So T would be 1, but it

---------------

's given as 0. So this violates the Pauli condition.

Wait, but earlier I thought that for T=0, S must be even.

---------------

 But in option D, S=1 (odd), which would require L to be even for S+L to be odd. But L is 1 (odd), so S+L=2 →

---------------

 even. So Pauli condition not met.

So which options are allowed? Only option D meets the parity condition, but violates

---------------

 the Pauli condition. So the other options all have L_final even, which violates parity condition.

Wait, but the question

---------------

 is asking which partial wave is not permitted. So which options are not allowed due to the Pauli condition or parity.

So

---------------

 let's check each option again, considering both conditions.

Option A: L_final=2 (even) → parity condition not

---------------

 met. So invalid.

Option B: L_final=0 (even) → parity condition not met. Invalid.

Option C: L_final=2 → parity condition not met. Invalid.

Option D: L_final=1 → parity condition met. Now

---------------

 check Pauli condition.

Final state: S=1, L=1. T = S + L +1 mod 2 → T =1+1+1=3 mod 2 → 1. But T is given as 0. So condition

---------------

 not met → invalid.

So all options except D meet the parity condition? No, D meets parity, but violates Pauli. The

---------------

 other options violate parity.

Wait, but the question says which partial wave is not permitted. So perhaps the correct answer is option

---------------

 D, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the conditions. Let's think again.

The correct

---------------

 conditions are:

1. Parity: L_final must be odd (since (-1)^L_final = -1).

2. Pauli: S_final must be even (

---------------

since T=0 → S + L must be 1 mod 2. Since L is odd, S must be even (

---------------

because odd + even = odd).

So the final state must have S=0, L=odd.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Final

---------------

 state S=3, L=2 → L even. No → invalid.

Option B: Final state S=1, L=0 → L even. No → invalid.

Option C: Final state S=1, L=2 → L even. No → invalid.

Option D: Final state S=1, L=1 → L odd. But

---------------

 S=1 is odd. So S is odd. So S + L = 2 → even. Which doesn't meet Pauli condition (needs

---------------

 to be 1 mod 2). So option D is invalid.

Wait, so all options are invalid except... but that

---------------

 can't be right. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in determining S from the term symbol.

Wait, the term symbol is

---------------

 (2S+1)L(J). So for option D, the term is 3P0. So (2S+1)=3 → S=1. So

---------------

 yes, S=1. But we need S to be even (0 or 2) because S must be even.



---------------

So all options have S=1 or S=3, which are odd, but we need S=0 (even) for

---------------

 T=0. So none of the options have a final state with S=0. But that's impossible because the options

---------------

 are given, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the Pauli condition. The condition is T = S + L + 1 mod 2. So

---------------

 for T=0:

0 = S + L + 1 mod 2 → S + L = 1 mod 2.

So S and L must have opposite parities. So

---------------

 if L is odd, S must be even. If L is even, S must be odd.

In the initial state, the

---------------

 NN is in 1S0 → S=0, L=0. After emission, the final state must have T=0.



---------------

So the final state must have S and L with opposite parities.

Now, considering each option:

Option A: L=2 (even), S=3 (odd). So S+

---------------

L=5 → 1 mod 2. So condition holds. But L must be odd (from parity condition), so

---------------

 this is invalid.

Option B: L=0 (even), S=1 (odd). S+L=1 → 1 mod 2. Condition holds. But L must be odd →

---------------

 invalid.

Option C: L=2 (even), S=1 (odd). S+L=3 → 1 mod 2. Condition holds. But L must be odd → invalid.

Option D: L=1 (odd), S=1 (odd). S+L=2 → 0 mod 2. Condition not met. So this

---------------

 is invalid.

Wait, but none of the options meet both conditions. Because the only option that meets the parity condition (L_final

---------------

 odd) is option D, but it doesn't meet the Pauli condition.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try

---------------

 a different approach. Let's consider each option's final NN state and check the conditions.

The correct final state must have:

- L_final is odd (from parity condition).


---------------

- S_final is even (because L is odd, so S must be even for S+L to be odd, making

---------------

 T=0).

Looking at the options:

Option A: L=2 (even) → no.

Option B: L=0 (even) → no.

Option C: L=2 → no.

Option D: L=1 (odd). Now

---------------

, S_final must be even. The term is 3P0 → S=1 (odd). So S is 

---------------

1 → which is odd. So condition not met.

Wait, so all options either have L even or S odd. So

---------------

 none satisfy both conditions. But that can't be right because the question expects one option to be invalid.

Wait, perhaps I made

---------------

 a mistake in the parity condition. Let me recheck.

The parity condition is that the parity of the final NN state must

---------------

 be -1 because:

P_initial = P_NN_final * P_X → 1 = (-1) * P_NN_final → P_NN_final = -1 → (-1)^{L_final} = -1 → L_final is odd.

So L

---------------

_final must be odd.

Now, looking at the options again:

Option A: L_final=2 → even → invalid.

Option B: L_final=0 → even → invalid.

Option C: L_final=2 → even → invalid.

Option D: L_final=1 → odd → valid.

---------------

 Now, check S_final.

In option D, the final state is 3P0 → S=1. So S_final is 1 (odd). So

---------------

 S + L = 1 +1 =2 → even. So Pauli condition requires T=0 → 0 = (

---------------

even) +1 mod 2 → 1 → which is not correct. So Pauli condition not met.

So all

---------------

 options are invalid except none. But the question says one is not permitted. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem

---------------

 is considering that the emitted X carries away some angular momentum, so the total angular momentum must be conserved. So the initial J=0 must equal the sum of the final NN J and X's J.

But

---------------

 I'm not sure how to handle that, as it complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering orbital angular momentum,

---------------

 and not spin.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that the emitted X has orbital angular momentum l, and the total

---------------

 orbital angular momentum must be conserved.

Wait, the initial orbital angular momentum is L_initial=0. After emission, the orbital

---------------

 angular momentum of the NN system is L_final, and the emitted X has orbital angular momentum l_X. So conservation of orbital angular momentum would

---------------

 require L_initial = L_final + l_X → 0 = L_final + l_X → L_final = -l_X. But since L

---------------

 and l are non-negative integers, the only solution is L_final = l_X =0. But in our case, L_final must be odd, so this can

---------------

't be. So this approach can't be correct.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try

---------------

 to summarize:

The correct option must have:

1. L_final is odd.

2. S_final is even (0 or

---------------

 2, but for two nucleons, only S=0 is possible).

So looking at the options, none have L_final odd and S=0.

Wait, but

---------------

 perhaps I'm making a mistake in determining S from the term symbol. Let me recheck:

Option D: 3P0 → (2S+1)=3 → S=1.

---------------

 So S=1 (odd). So can't have S even.

So none of the options have S=0 and L=odd. So

---------------

 perhaps the correct answer is option D, which violates the Pauli condition, but meets the parity condition. But since the question

---------------

 is about which partial wave is not permitted, I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to look for which

---------------

 option violates either the parity or Pauli condition.

The only option that meets the parity condition is D, but it violates the Pauli condition. The others violate the parity condition.

So

---------------

 the question is which partial wave is not permitted. Since the problem states that the final NN state has T=0, and

---------------

 the options must satisfy both conditions.

Therefore, the correct answer must be the option that either violates the parity condition or the Pauli condition.

Looking

---------------

 at the options:

Option D: Meets parity condition but violates Pauli.

The others: violate parity condition.

So the

---------------

 problem is asking which partial wave is not permitted. So the option that is not allowed is the one that violates either condition.

But

---------------

 the question is about which partial wave is not permitted, so perhaps the correct answer is option D because it violates the Pauli condition.

Wait, but I

---------------

'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis.

Wait, another approach: since the initial state is 

---------------

1S0 (S=0, L=0, J=0), and the emitted particle has l_X. The final state must

---------------

 have:

- L_final is odd (from parity condition).
- S_final is even (so S=0).

So the

---------------

 final NN state must have S=0, L=odd.

Now, looking at the options:

Which option has S=0 and L=odd?

Looking

---------------

 at each option's term symbol:

Option A: 7D1 → (2S+1)=7 → S=3 (

---------------

odd). No.

Option B: 3S1 → S=1 (odd). No.

Option C: 3D3 → S=1 (odd). No.

Option D: 3P0 → S=1 (odd). No.

So

---------------

 none of the options have S=0. So all options are invalid. But that can't be right. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding

---------------

 the Pauli condition.

Wait, perhaps the Pauli condition is T = (S + L) mod 2, but

---------------

 the problem states T = S + L +1 mod 2. So for T=0:

S + L +1 ≡0 mod 2 → S + L ≡1 mod 2.

So S

---------------

 and L must have opposite parities.

So in the final state, if L is odd, S must be even, and vice versa.

But

---------------

 in all the options, the final state has S=1 (odd) and L varies.

So the only way to have

---------------

 S+L=1 mod 2 is if L is even. Because 1 (S) + even (L) = odd.



---------------

But L must be odd from parity condition. So this is a contradiction.

So all the options are invalid, but the question expects

---------------

 one correct answer. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the initial state's S is 0, but the

---------------

 emitted X carries away some spin, so the final S could be 0.

Wait, but the problem states that the NN

---------------

 system's spin is S_final, which must be even. So the only possible S_final is 0.

Looking again at the options, none

---------------

 have S=0. So all options are invalid, but the question says one is not permitted.

Hmm, perhaps I'm

---------------

 missing something. Maybe the emitted X's spin affects the NN's spin. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem

---------------

 is expecting us to look for which option doesn't have L_final + l_X even, i.e., parity condition not met.

So

---------------

 the correct answer would be the option where L_final + l_X is odd.

Looking at the options:

Option A: L=2, l_X=1 → sum 3 → odd → parity condition not met.

Option B: L=0, l_X=1 → sum 1 → odd → parity

---------------

 condition not met.

Option C: L=2, l_X=3 → sum 5 → odd → parity condition not met.

Option D: L=1, l_X=0 → sum 1 → odd → parity condition not met.

Wait, but

---------------

 that can't be. Because earlier I thought option D meets the parity condition. But according to this, all options have L + l_X odd, which

---------------

 would mean their parity condition is not met.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Perhaps the correct answer is option D because

---------------

 it's the only one that meets the parity condition but violates the Pauli condition, making it the one not permitted.


To solve the problem, we analyze the conditions given

---------------

 and evaluate each option systematically:

### Key Conditions:
1. **Parity Conservation**:  
   The initial parity of the NN system is \( P_{\text{initial}} = 1 \) (from the \( 1S_0 \) state). After emission, the parity of the final NN state \( P_{\text{NN}} \) and the emitted particle \( X \) must satisfy:  
   \[
   P_{\text{initial}} = P_{\text{NN}} \cdot P_X
   \]  
   Given \( P_X = -1 \), this implies:  
   \[
   1 = P_{\text{NN}} \cdot (-1) \implies P_{\text{NN}} = -1
   \]  
   The parity of the NN system is \( (-1)^{L_{\text{final}}} \), so:  
   \[
   (-1)^{L_{\text{final}}} = -1 \implies L_{\text{final}} \text{ is odd}.
   \]

2. **Pauli Condition**:  
   For the final NN state, the isospin \( T_{\text{NN}} \), spin \( S_{\text{NN}} \), and orbital angular momentum \( L_{\text{NN}} \) satisfy:  
   \[
   T_{\text{NN}} = S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2).
   \]  
   Given \( T_{\text{NN}} = 0 \), this simplifies to:  
   \[
   S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2).
   \]  
   Since \( L_{\text{final}} \) is odd (from the parity condition), \( S_{\text{NN}} \) must be even to satisfy \( S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \).

### Analysis of Each Option:
#### **Option A: \( 1S_0 \to 7D_1 + p \)**
- Final NN state: \( 7D_1 \).  
  - \( (2S+1) = 7 \implies S = 3 \) (odd).  
  - \( L = D = 2 \) (even).  
- **

---------------

Parity Check**:  
  \( L_{\text{final}} = 2 \) (even) \(\implies (-1)^{L_{\text{final}}} = 1 \).  
  This violates the parity condition \( P_{\text{NN}} = -1 \).  
- **Conclusion**: Invalid.

#### **Option B: \( 1S_0 \to 3S_1 + p \)**
- Final NN state: \( 3S_1 \).  
  - \( (2S+1) = 3 \implies S = 1 \) (odd).  
  - \( L = S = 0 \) (even).  
- **Parity Check**:  
  \( L_{\text{final}} = 0 \) (even) \(\implies (-1)^{L_{\text{final}}} = 1 \).  
  This violates the parity condition \( P_{\text{NN}} = -1 \).  
- **Conclusion**: Invalid.

#### **Option C: \( 1S_0 \to 3D_3 + f \)**
- Final NN state: \( 3D_3 \).  
  - \( (2S+1) = 3 \implies S = 1 \) (odd).  
  - \( L = D = 2 \) (even).  
- **Parity Check**:  
  \( L_{\text{final}} = 2 \) (even) \(\implies (-1)^{L_{\text{final}}} = 1 \).  
  This violates the parity condition \( P_{\text{NN}} = -1 \).  
- **Conclusion**: Invalid.

#### **Option D: \( 1S_0 \to 3P_0 + s \)**
- Final NN state: \( 3P_0 \).  
  - \( (2S+1) = 3 \implies S = 1 \) (odd).  
  - \( L = P = 1 \) (odd).  
- **Parity Check**:  
  \( L_{\text{final}} = 1 \) (odd) \(\implies (-1)^{L_{\text{final}}} = -1 \).  
  This satisfies the parity condition \( P_{\text{NN}} = -1 \).  
- **Pauli Condition Check**:  
  \( S_{\text{NN}} = 1 \) (odd), \( L_{\text{NN}} = 1 \) (odd).  
  \( S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} = 2 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod } 2) \).  
  This violates the Pauli condition \( S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \).  
- **Conclusion**: Invalid.

### Final Answer:
All options are

---------------

 invalid under the given conditions. However, the problem specifies that one partial wave is not permitted. Based on the analysis, **Option D** is the only option that satisfies the parity condition but violates the Pauli condition, making it the correct answer.
