Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator

---------------

 has mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. The

---------------

 options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Wait, I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is

---------------

 when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So for a non-relativistic oscillator, the max speed v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m). But

---------------

 this is a relativistic case, so things are different because of the speed of light limit.

Relativistic effects come into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So

---------------

 I need to consider the relativistic equations of motion and energy.

In special relativity, the total energy E is given by gamma mc

---------------

², where gamma is the Lorentz factor: 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The kinetic

---------------

 energy is E - mc², which equals (gamma - 1) mc².

In the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy at maximum displacement is (1/2)kA². So

---------------

 the total energy E is (1/2)kA². But wait, in relativity, the energy expression might

---------------

 change because of the relativistic mass or the form of energy.

Wait, no, the potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is still

---------------

 (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore because

---------------

 of relativistic effects. So the total energy would be the sum of relativistic kinetic energy and potential energy.

At maximum displacement x = A, the oscillator

---------------

 is momentarily at rest, so all energy is potential. Then, as it moves towards the equilibrium point, potential energy converts to kinetic, reaching

---------------

 maximum speed when all potential is converted to kinetic. But wait, in the relativistic case, the maximum speed isn't achieved

---------------

 because as v approaches c, gamma increases, making kinetic energy approach infinity. But in this case, the oscillator is constrained by the potential, so maybe

---------------

 there's a point where the speed is maximum but less than c.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to equate the total energy at

---------------

 the maximum displacement with the total energy when the oscillator is at the equilibrium point (x=0) but moving at maximum speed.

So when

---------------

 x=A, the speed is zero, so the total energy E is (1/2)kA². But wait

---------------

, in relativity, the potential energy is the same as in the classical case, but the kinetic energy is relativistic. So

---------------

, when the oscillator is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic, so E = K + mc², where

---------------

 K is the relativistic kinetic energy.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx². So

---------------

 at x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². The total energy E is the sum of kinetic

---------------

 and potential. At x=A, the kinetic energy is zero because the velocity is zero. So E = (1/2)kA².

But

---------------

 in relativity, the total energy is also given by E = gamma mc². Wait, no. No, because when

---------------

 the oscillator is at x=A, it's at rest, so gamma is just 1, so E should be mc² +

---------------

 (1/2)kA². Wait, that can't be right because for small amplitudes, the potential

---------------

 energy is small, but the rest energy is mc². So that seems correct.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The

---------------

 rest energy is mc², and when the oscillator is at x=A, all energy is potential: E = (1/2)kA². But

---------------

 this can't be right because then E would have to equal both (1/2)kA² and gamma mc².

---------------

 But that would mean (1/2)kA² = gamma mc², but at x=A, the velocity is zero, so gamma is 1, so

---------------

 (1/2)kA² = mc², which would require kA² = 2mc². But that

---------------

's a specific condition, and the problem doesn't state that. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the

---------------

 total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy. So when x=A, E = mc² + (1/2)kA². Because

---------------

 the rest energy is always there, and the potential adds to it. Then, when the oscillator is at x=0, the

---------------

 potential is zero, and the kinetic energy is at maximum. So the total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy.



---------------

So at x=0, E = mc² + K, where K is the relativistic kinetic energy. K is (gamma - 1) mc². So,



---------------

E = mc² + (gamma - 1) mc² = gamma mc².

But E is also (1/2)kA² + mc²,

---------------

 from when x=A. So,

gamma mc² = (1/2)kA² + mc².

Subtracting mc² from both sides:

gamma mc² - mc² = (1/2)kA².

mc

---------------

² (gamma -1) = (1/2) k A².

So,

gamma -1 = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Gamma

---------------

 is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) -1 = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me let

---------------

 x = v²/c². Then,

1/sqrt(1 -x) -1 = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let

---------------

 me call (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a variable, say, alpha. So,

1/sqrt(1 -x) = 1 + alpha.

S

---------------

quaring both sides,

1/(1 -x) = (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

1 -x = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

R

---------------

earranging,

x = 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2].

But x is v²/c², so,



---------------

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2].

So,

v_max = c sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2 ]

---------------

 )

Wait, but let me plug in alpha:

alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^

---------------

2 ] )

Let me compute 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2.



---------------

Wait, let me see the options. Option D is v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)))

---------------

^2 ). That matches what I have here. So the correct answer would be option D.

Wait, but let me double

---------------

-check the steps.

Wait, when x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². So the total energy is

---------------

 E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

When the oscillator is at x=0, it's moving at

---------------

 maximum speed v_max. The total energy at that point is E = mc² + K, where K is relativistic kinetic energy.



---------------

So,

E = mc² + K = mc² + (gamma -1) mc² = gamma mc².

Set

---------------

 equal:

gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)k A².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

Hmm

---------------

, wait, wait. Because (1/2)k A^2 = (k A^2)/2, so (

---------------

k A^2)/(2 m c²) is alpha.

So,

gamma = 1 + alpha.

Which is the

---------------

 same as earlier.

So,

gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) = 1 + alpha.

So

---------------

,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha.

Then, solving for v²/c²:



---------------

1/(1 + alpha)^2 = 1 - v²/c².

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Which

---------------

 is,

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)

---------------

 ) )^2 ] )

Which matches option D.

Looking at the options:

Option D) v_max = c√[1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c²))^

---------------

2 ) ]

Wait, no, the denominator in the fraction is (1 + (kA²/(2mc²)))

---------------

 squared, yes.

So the answer should be option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we consider the relativistic energy conservation

---------------

. The total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is the sum of the rest energy \( mc^2 \) and the potential energy at maximum displacement \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). Thus, at \( x = A \), the total energy is:

\[
E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

At \( x = 0 \), all the energy is converted into relativistic kinetic energy. The total energy is also given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. Equating the two expressions for \( E \), we have:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Subtracting \( mc^2 \) from both sides:

\[
\gamma mc^2 - mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Factoring out \( mc^2 \):

\[
mc^2 (\gamma - 1) = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Dividing through by \( mc^2 \):

\[
\gamma - 1 = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Let \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \alpha.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \alpha.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = (1 + \alpha)^2.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}.
\]

Thus:

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}}.
\]

Substituting \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A** and **Option B** incorrectly

---------------

 modify the denominator or the structure of the equation.
- **Option C** is the classical (non-relativistic) result and does not account for relativistic effects.

Thus, the correct answer is:
