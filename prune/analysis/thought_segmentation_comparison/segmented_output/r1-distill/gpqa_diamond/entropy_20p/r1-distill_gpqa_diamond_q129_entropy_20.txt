Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, specifically about detecting large clouds of neutral hydrogen using ground-based optical telescopes. Hmm, let me think through

---------------

 this step by step.

The question says that these clouds absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. Wait

---------------

, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet range, right? Because hydrogen's Lyman series transitions

---------------

 are in UV. So if the quasar emits this light, and the hydrogen clouds absorb it, the absorption line would be shifted

---------------

 due to the expansion of the universe, right? So redshift comes into play here.

The main point is to find the lower limit on the redshift such

---------------

 that these objects can be detected with optical telescopes. Optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because the atmosphere blocks it.

---------------

 So the observed wavelength after redshift must be in the optical range.

Let me recall the redshift formula. The observed wavelength lambda_obs is equal to the emitted wavelength lambda_emit multiplied by (1 + z), where z is the redshift. So lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + z).

We

---------------

 want the Lyman alpha line (1216 Angstroms) to be in the optical range. What's the cutoff

---------------

 between optical and UV? I think the atmosphere is opaque to UV below about 3000 Angstroms (which is 300 nm,

---------------

 since 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm). So anything longer than that can pass through the atmosphere and be seen by ground-based telescopes.

Wait, actually

---------------

, no. Let me double-check. The Earth's atmosphere is transparent to wavelengths longer than about 3000 Angstroms (3

---------------

00 nm) into the UV, but for ground-based optical, visible light is about 400-700 nm. So

---------------

 optical telescopes can't observe UV. So the Lyman alpha absorption line, when redshifted, needs to be in the optical,

---------------

 i.e., longer than 400 nm but not too long. Wait, actually, no—the question is about being

---------------

 detectable with optical telescopes. So the redshifted wavelength must be in the optical, which is longer than about 400 nm (

---------------

4000 Angstroms). Wait, no, 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms.

---------------

 So 1216 Angstroms is about 121.6 nm, which is in the far UV. So

---------------

 if this is redshifted into the optical, the observed wavelength must be above 4000 Angstroms (

---------------

400 nm) because that's where optical starts.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again

---------------

. The observed wavelength must be in the range that optical telescopes can detect. So for ground-based telescopes, the observed

---------------

 wavelength must be longer than about 3000 Angstroms (since shorter is blocked by atmosphere). So the Ly

---------------

man alpha line, at 1216 Angstroms, when redshifted, must be longer than 3000 Angstroms.

---------------

 Let's calculate the minimum redshift.

So, lambda_obs >= 3000 Angstroms. So,

lambda

---------------

_obs = 1216 * (1 + z) >= 3000

Divide both sides by 1216:

1 + z >= 3000 / 1216 ≈ 2.465

---------------

8

So z >= ~1.4658. Wait, but wait, the question says 'lower limit' on

---------------

 the redshift. So any z higher than this would make the observed wavelength longer than 3000 Angstroms, meaning

---------------

 it's in the optical range. So the minimum redshift is when lambda_obs is just 3000 Angstroms. So z �

---------------

� 1.4658, which is approximately 1.47.

Looking at the options, the choices

---------------

 are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Wait, none

---------------

 of these options match 1.47. Hmm. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, maybe I got the cutoff

---------------

 wrong. Maybe the optical range starts at a longer wavelength. Let me think: the atmosphere is opaque to wavelengths below about 3000 Angstroms (3

---------------

00 nm), which is in the UV. So for a ground-based telescope, to observe a wavelength in the optical, the

---------------

 observed wavelength must be longer than 3000 Angstroms. So the calculation I did is correct, which gives z ~

---------------

1.47.

But none of the options are near 1.47. Let me check the options again.

---------------

 Option B is 1.2, which is lower than 1.47. So z=1.2 would give

---------------

 lambda_obs = 1216*(1+1.2)= 1216*2.2≈

---------------

2675 Angstroms. Which is still in the UV (since 3000 is the cutoff).

---------------

 So that's below 3000, so it's not visible. So z must be higher than ~1.47.

---------------

 The next higher options are D)1.9 and C)2.4.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit.

---------------

 So the minimal z is 1.47, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the cutoff

---------------

 wavelength.

Wait, another approach: maybe the optical range is considered to start at 400 nm (4000 Angstroms). So

---------------

 let's recalculate with lambda_obs >= 4000 Angstroms.

So 1216*(1+z) >=4000



---------------

1+z >= 4000/1216 ≈3.289

z >= 2.289.



---------------

So the lower limit is approximately 2.29. So looking at the options, the closest higher is option C)2.4 and

---------------

 D)1.9 is lower than that.

Wait, but if the cutoff is 3000 Angstroms, then

---------------

 1.47 is the limit, but that's not an option. But if the cutoff is 4000 Angstroms, then

---------------

 2.29 is the limit, which isn't an option either.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the Ly

---------------

man limit or something else. Alternatively, maybe the quasar's light is being absorbed, but the rest wavelength is 1216 Ang

---------------

stroms, and when redshifted, we need it to be in the visible spectrum. So the observed wavelength should be greater

---------------

 than 400 nm (4000 Angstroms).

Wait, let me recalculate.

If the observed

---------------

 wavelength is 4000 Angstroms:

z = (4000/1216) -1 ≈ (

---------------

3.289) -1 = 2.289.

So the redshift needs to be at least 

---------------

2.29. So the minimal redshift is 2.29, so the lower limit is that. The

---------------

 options given are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So

---------------

 2.4 is option C, which is higher than 2.29. So the minimal redshift is approximately

---------------

 2.29, which is close to 2.4. But wait, why is 2.4 the

---------------

 option and not 2.3 or something?

Alternatively, perhaps the cutoff is 3000 Angstroms,

---------------

 which gives z= (3000/1216) -1 ≈ (2.466) -1 =

---------------

 1.466. So the minimal redshift is approximately 1.47.

But the options don't have that

---------------

. So perhaps the question is considering that the quasar's light is being observed in the optical. Wait, no—the qu

---------------

asar's light is from the background, but the absorption is by the hydrogen cloud. So the absorption line must be in the observed

---------------

 spectrum.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the quasar itself is at a redshift where its visible light is being observed. Wait

---------------

, no, the quasar emits light across the spectrum. The absorption occurs at the Lyman alpha wavelength in the quasar's frame. So

---------------

 when the cloud is at a higher redshift, the absorption line is shifted further.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the

---------------

 rest frame of the quasar and the cloud. Let me imagine that the quasar is at a certain redshift, and the cloud is at a higher redshift. So

---------------

 the cloud's Lyman alpha line, when observed, is in the optical.

Wait, but the question says the clouds are absorbing

---------------

 the light from the background quasars. So the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud. Because the

---------------

 cloud is in front, so the light from the quasar passes through the cloud, which is at a lower redshift.

---------------

 Wait, no—wait, the quasar is behind the cloud. So the cloud is at a higher redshift than the quasar. No

---------------

, wait, higher redshift means further away. So if the cloud is between us and the quasar, then the cloud has a lower redshift than the quasar. Because

---------------

 the quasar is farther away.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. If the cloud is in front of the quasar, then

---------------

 the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar. Because the quasar is farther away. So when we observe the quasar's light, it

---------------

 has been redshifted more than the cloud's.

So the Lyman alpha absorption line from the cloud would be at a wavelength

---------------

 that is (1 + z_cloud) * 1216 Angstroms. But the quasar's own emission lines

---------------

 are at (1 + z_quasar) * their rest wavelengths. So if the cloud is at z_cloud, then the absorption line is

---------------

 at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). We want this to be in the optical, so 1216*(1 + z_cloud) >

---------------

 3000 Angstroms.

So z_cloud must be >= (3000/1216) -1 ≈ 1.466.

So

---------------

 the minimal z_cloud is about 1.466. Now, looking at the options, the closest higher is option D)1.9,

---------------

 but that's larger than 1.47. Wait, but why not pick the minimal z where it's just possible

---------------

.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the quasar's own emission is in the optical, so the quasar must

---------------

 be at a higher redshift than the cloud. But that's a different point.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the qu

---------------

asar's light must have its own optical lines. But I think the main point is about the absorption line being in the optical.

Wait

---------------

, but the options don't have 1.47. So perhaps I made a mistake in the cutoff.

Alternatively, maybe the question

---------------

 is using the Lyman break as the cutoff. The Lyman limit is about 912 Angstroms (91.2 nm), but

---------------

 I'm not sure that's relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the Lyman-alpha forest, where absorption lines are seen

---------------

 in quasar spectra. But for ground-based telescopes, the observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha line must be in the optical

---------------

, which is about 400-700 nm (4000-7000 Angstroms).

So let

---------------

's calculate when 1216*(1+z) is in the optical range, say above 4000 Angstroms.

1

---------------

216*(1+z) >=4000

1+z >=4000/1216 ≈3.289

z >=2.289.

So the

---------------

 minimal redshift is about 2.29. So the lower limit would be just above 2.29. Looking

---------------

 at the options, option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.29. So if the options

---------------

 don't have 2.3, then 2.4 is the next possible choice.

But wait, let me re

---------------

check the calculations.

If z=2.289, then the observed wavelength is exactly 4000 Angstroms.

---------------

 So anything higher than that would make the wavelength longer than 4000, which is in the optical. So the lower limit is 

---------------

2.289, so the minimal redshift is just over 2.29. So any option higher than that would suffice

---------------

. But the question asks for the lower limit. So the minimal redshift is approximately 2.29, so the lower

---------------

 limit is z=2.29.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is higher

---------------

 than 2.29, so that's acceptable. So the answer would be option C)2.4.

Wait, but why

---------------

 is option D)1.9 even an option? Because if z=1.9, then 1216*(1+1.9)=1216*2.9≈3526.4 Angstroms. 

---------------

3526 is in the UV (since it's less than 3000? Wait, wait no:

---------------

 3000 Angstroms is 300 nm, which is the cutoff. 3526 is about

---------------

 352.6 nm, which is still in the UV. So a redshift of 1.9 would

---------------

 result in observed wavelength 3526, which is below the 3000 cutoff. So it can't be detected by

---------------

 optical telescopes. Therefore, the redshift must be higher than ~2.29.

So the correct answer is option

---------------

 C)2.4.


To determine the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen such that their Lyman alpha absorption line (

---------------

rest wavelength ~1216 Å) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to ensure that the redshifted wavelength falls within the optical range. Optical telescopes are

---------------

 sensitive to wavelengths in the range of approximately 400–700 nm (4000–7000 Å). Additionally

---------------

, the Earth's atmosphere is opaque to wavelengths shorter than ~3000 Å, so the observed wavelength must be at least 3000 Å to be detectable.

The relationship between the observed wavelength (\

---------------

( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)), the rest wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{emit}} \)), and the redshift (\( z \)) is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot (1 + z)
\]

###

---------------

 Step 1: Calculate the minimum redshift for detection
To ensure the Lyman alpha line is in the optical range, we set \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \geq 3000 \, \text{Å} \). Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{emit}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \):

\[
1216 \cdot (1 + z) \geq 3000
\]

\[
1 + z \geq \frac{3000}{1216} \approx 2.466
\]

\[
z \geq 2.466 - 1 \approx 1.466
\]

Thus, the minimum redshift is approximately \( z \geq 1.47 \).

### Step 2: Adjust

---------------

 for stricter optical cutoff
If we consider the optical range to start at 4000 Å (visible light), the calculation becomes:

\[
1216 \cdot (1 + z) \geq 4000
\]

\[
1 + z \geq \frac{4000}{1216} \approx 3.289
\]

\[
z \geq 3.289 - 1 \approx 2.289
\]

Thus, the minimum redshift is approximately \( z \geq 2.29 \).

### Step 3: Compare with the options
The options provided are:
- **A) 3**
- **B) 1.2**
- **C) 2.4**
- **D) 1.9**

From the calculations:
- A redshift of \( z = 1.2 \) (option B) results in \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \cdot (1 + 1.2) = 2675 \, \text{Å} \), which is in the UV and not detectable by optical telescopes.
- A redshift of \( z = 1.9 \) (option D) results in \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \cdot (1 + 1.9) = 3526 \, \text{Å} \), which is still in the UV and not detectable.
- A redshift of \( z = 2.4 \) (option C) results in \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \cdot (1 + 2.4) = 4126

---------------

 \, \text{Å} \), which is in the optical range and detectable.
- A redshift of \( z = 3 \) (option A) is also valid but unnecessarily

---------------

 high since \( z = 2.4 \) suffices.

### Conclusion
The lower limit on the redshift is approximately \( z \geq 2.29 \), and the closest option is **C) 2.4**.
