Okay, so I've got this question about redshift and detecting objects with ground-based telescopes. Hmm, let me think.

---------------

 The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space. These clouds absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is around 1216 Angstroms. The

---------------

 question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

Wait, I

---------------

 remember that the Lyman alpha line is emitted by hydrogen when it transitions from an excited state to a lower energy state. The

---------------

 rest wavelength of Lyman alpha is about 121.6 nanometers, which is 1216 Angstroms. Right

---------------

, because 1 nm is 10 Angstroms. So the quasar's light at this wavelength is being absorbed by the hydrogen clouds.

But

---------------

 when the hydrogen cloud is moving away from us due to the expansion of the universe, the wavelength gets stretched, or redshifted. So the observed wavelength (

---------------

λ_observed) would be longer than the rest wavelength (λ_rest). The formula I think is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z), where z is the redshift.

But

---------------

 wait, the question is about detecting these absorption lines. So the quasar's light must pass through the hydrogen cloud, and the cloud's

---------------

 redshifted Lyman alpha wavelength must fall into the observable range of the telescope.

Ground-based optical telescopes can't observe all

---------------

 wavelengths. They can't see through the atmosphere, right? So what's the atmospheric window? Oh, right, the atmosphere is opaque to many

---------------

 wavelengths. For optical, the visible spectrum is about 400-700 nm. But wait, Lyman alpha is 

---------------

121 nm, which is in the far ultraviolet. So if the cloud is at a certain redshift, the observed

---------------

 wavelength might shift into the visible range, making it detectable from the ground.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The

---------------

 quasar emits light across the spectrum, including the Lyman alpha. But if the cloud is at a high redshift, then

---------------

 the Lyman alpha absorption line would be shifted into a longer wavelength. So if the cloud is at redshift z, the observed

---------------

 wavelength is 1216 Angstroms * (1 + z). We need this wavelength to be in the range that ground

---------------

-based telescopes can observe. Since the atmosphere blocks a lot of UV, but allows some optical (visible) wavelengths through.

So

---------------

 the question is, what's the minimum redshift such that the Lyman alpha line is redshifted into the optical range.

---------------

 Because if it's redshifted into the optical, then it can be detected from the ground. If it's still in UV, then

---------------

 it's blocked by the atmosphere and can't be seen.

What's the threshold? So let's find the redshift where 1216 Angstroms * (1 + z) is

---------------

 equal to about 400 nm (since 400 nm is the start of the visible spectrum). Wait, no

---------------

, wait: 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. Because 1 nm is 10 Angstroms. So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms.

So setting

---------------

 up the equation: 1216 * (1 + z) = 4000.

Wait, let

---------------

 me compute that. 1216 * (1 + z) = 4000.

Divide both sides by 1216: 1 + z = 4000 / 1216.

Let

---------------

 me calculate that: 4000 divided by 1216. Let's see, 1216 *

---------------

 3 is 3648, which is less than 4000. 1216 * 3.296

---------------

... Let me compute 4000 / 1216.

Hmm, 1216 times 3 is 3648. 4000-3648 = 352. So 352 / 1216 = 0.289 approximately. So total is 

---------------

3.289. So 1 + z = ~3.289, so z is approximately 2.289.

Wait, but

---------------

 the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal z such that the observed wavelength is just entering the optical range

---------------

 (i.e., above 400 nm or 4000 Angstroms). So the minimum z is about

---------------

 2.29.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4 and option D is 1.9. So

---------------

 2.29 is closest to option C (2.4), but wait, maybe I did the calculation wrong.

---------------

 Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the wavelength range that is accessible. Another thought: the quasar's light

---------------

 is being absorbed at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is 1216 Angstroms. If the cloud is at redshift z, then the observed

---------------

 wavelength is 1216*(1+z) Angstroms.

But ground-based telescopes can't observe below about 300 nm (which

---------------

 is 3000 Angstroms), because the atmosphere absorbs below that. Wait, no, the atmosphere is opaque to most

---------------

 UV. The window for ground-based optical is roughly 300 nm (near UV) to about 1000 nm (infrared). Wait

---------------

, no, visible is about 400-700 nm. So if the observed wavelength is in the visible,

---------------

 say 400 nm and above, then it's detectable.

Wait, but 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. So to

---------------

 have the Lyman alpha line shifted into the visible range, the observed wavelength should be at least 4000 Angstroms.

---------------

 So 1216*(1 + z) >= 4000.

So solving for z: z >= (4000/1216) - 1.

Compute

---------------

 4000 / 1216: Let's calculate that.

1216 * 3 = 3648.

---------------

 4000-3648 = 352. 352 / 1216 = 0.289 approx

---------------

. So 3.289. So z = 2.289.

So z must be at least approximately

---------------

 2.29. So looking at the options, the closest is option C) 2.4, which is just

---------------

 above. But option D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.29.

Wait, but wait

---------------

, perhaps the quasar's light is observed in the optical, but the absorption line is in the UV part of the quasar's spectrum. Wait

---------------

, no, I think I have it right. The absorption line is from the cloud, which is at a higher redshift than the quasar?

---------------

 Or is the quasar at a higher redshift?

Wait, no. The quasar is the background object, so its

---------------

 light passes through the hydrogen cloud, which is in front of it (i.e., closer to us). So the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud. So

---------------

 the cloud's redshift is lower than the quasar's. So when we observe the quasar's spectrum, the absorption line from

---------------

 the cloud is at a wavelength corresponding to z_cloud.

Wait, that's correct. So the observed wavelength of the absorption line is 

---------------

1216*(1 + z_cloud). To be in the optical range (so that we can detect it from the ground), this

---------------

 wavelength must be >= 400 nm (4000 Angstroms). So the calculation we did earlier holds

---------------

.

So the minimal z is about 2.29. So the lower limit is just above 2.29. The

---------------

 options are 1.9, 2.4, etc. So the lower limit would be when z is about 2.29. So

---------------

 the minimal z is approximately 2.3. So the options given are C) 2.4 and D) 1.9. So

---------------

 2.4 is higher than the calculated value, but perhaps the question is asking for the lower limit such that it's in

---------------

 the optical. So any z above 2.29 would be detected. So the lower limit is z=2.29,

---------------

 so the minimal z is just above that. The options don't have 2.3, but the closest higher value is 2.4,

---------------

 option C.

Wait, but wait another thing: perhaps the ground-based telescopes can't observe wavelengths less than about 300 nm (

---------------

3000 Angstroms), because of atmospheric absorption. So if the observed Lyman alpha is 3000 Angstroms, then

---------------

 z would be (3000/1216) -1. Let's calculate that.

3000 / 1216 �

---------------

� 2.468. So 2.468 -1 = 1.468. So z �

---------------

�1.47.

Wait, but then the observed wavelength would be 3000 Angstroms, which is 300 nm, which is in the near UV, but

---------------

 perhaps ground-based telescopes can't observe that because of atmospheric absorption. So the minimal redshift where the Lyman alpha is shifted

---------------

 into the visible (so that we can detect it with optical telescopes) would be when the observed wavelength is 400 nm (

---------------

4000 Angstroms).

Wait, so perhaps I was correct in the first calculation, where the observed wavelength needs

---------------

 to be at least 4000 Angstroms (400 nm). So the minimal z is approximately 2.29. So

---------------

 the lower limit is around 2.3, so the minimal z is 2.3. Looking at the options, the

---------------

 closest is option C) 2.4.

Wait, but the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. So 

---------------

2.3 is closest to option C.

But wait another thought: perhaps the quasar's light is observed in the optical, but

---------------

 the Lyman-alpha absorption is in the UV part of the quasar's spectrum. So if the cloud's redshift is such

---------------

 that the Lyman alpha line is in the UV, but the quasar's rest frame is emitting the light, which is

---------------

 redshifted further.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The quasar emits light across the spectrum, including the Lyman alpha at

---------------

 1216 Angstroms. But if the quasar is at a redshift z_q, then the qu

---------------

asar's Lyman alpha emission line would be observed at 1216*(1 + z_q). But in this problem, the hydrogen

---------------

 cloud is in front of the quasar, so the cloud's redshift z_cloud is less than z_q. So the hydrogen

---------------

 cloud absorbs the quasar's light at 1216 Angstroms (in the quasar's frame), which corresponds

---------------

 to a longer wavelength in our frame.

Wait, no. The hydrogen cloud is at redshift z_cloud. So the wavelength

---------------

 of the Lyman alpha absorption in our frame is 1216*(1 + z_cloud). So if that's

---------------

 in the optical (e.g., 4000 Angstroms), then the cloud's redshift is about 2.29.



---------------

But if the quasar is at a higher redshift, then its own Lyman alpha emission line would be even longer. But that

---------------

's a separate issue. The question is about the hydrogen cloud's redshift being detectable via Lyman alpha absorption in the quasar's spectrum.

So the

---------------

 cloud's Lyman alpha absorption line must be observed in the optical range. So the lower limit on the cloud's redshift is when the

---------------

 absorption line is at 4000 Angstroms. So the calculation gives z_cloud ≈ 2.29.

Looking

---------------

 back at the options, the closest is C) 2.4, which is higher than 2.29. So

---------------

 the minimal z is approximately 2.29, so the lower limit is 2.29. So any cloud

---------------

 with z >= 2.29 can be detected. So the minimal redshift is 2.29, so

---------------

 the lower limit is 2.29.

But the options don't have 2.3, but they have C) 2.4 and

---------------

 D) 1.9. So the correct option would be C)2.4.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps

---------------

 the quasar's emission line itself is redshifted into the optical, but the absorption line is in the UV. Wait

---------------

, no, because the absorption is at a lower redshift than the quasar.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the

---------------

 quasar's light being absorbed by the cloud, so the cloud must be at a higher redshift than the quasar?

---------------

 No, that can't be. Because the cloud is in front of the quasar, so the quasar is behind the cloud, meaning the cloud is closer to us,

---------------

 so lower redshift.

Wait, no. Let me get this right. The quasar is a background object, so the

---------------

 hydrogen cloud is in the foreground. So the light from the quasar passes through the cloud on its way to us. So the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar.

Therefore

---------------

, the Lyman alpha absorption line from the cloud is at a wavelength of 1216*(1 + z_cloud). So

---------------

 if z_cloud is too small, then the observed wavelength is still in the UV, which we can't see from the ground. So

---------------

 to be detected, the observed wavelength must be in the optical (e.g., 400-700 nm or

---------------

 4000-7000 Angstroms).

So the minimal redshift is when 1216*(1+z_cloud) = 4000 Angstroms.

---------------

 Which gives z_cloud ≈ 2.29.

So the lower limit on the redshift is approximately 2.3. The

---------------

 options given are 1.9 (D), 2.4 (C), etc. So the minimal z is about

---------------

 2.3, so the lower limit is 2.3, so the correct answer would be the option just above that, which is 2.4 (

---------------

option C).

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the quasar's light is observed in the optical, which is redshifted from

---------------

 the quasar's own emission. So the quasar's emission is in the optical, implying that the quasar's redshift z

---------------

_q is such that, for example, its Lyman alpha emission (at 1216 Angstroms) is observed at a

---------------

 wavelength longer than 4000 Angstroms. Wait, no, that's not necessary. The quasar's

---------------

 light is observed in optical, but the absorption line is at a different wavelength.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The main

---------------

 point is that the Lyman alpha absorption line must be in the optical (visible) range for ground-based telescopes to detect it. So the

---------------

 calculation I did earlier holds.

So the minimal z is about 2.29, so the lower limit is approximately 2.3. Among

---------------

 the options, the closest higher value is 2.4, which is option C.

But wait, another angle: perhaps

---------------

 the quasar's light is observed in the optical, so the quasar's redshift must be such that its own emission

---------------

 lines are in the optical. But that's a separate consideration from the absorption line. Because the absorption line is from a cloud

---------------

 in front of the quasar, so the cloud's redshift is lower than the quasar's.

Hmm, perhaps the

---------------

 question is asking about the cloud's redshift relative to the quasar. But no, the question states the clouds are in

---------------

 deep space, and the absorption is in the quasar's light. So the cloud's redshift is z_cloud, and the

---------------

 quasar's redshift is higher, z_quasar > z_cloud.

But the problem is only about the cloud's redshift.

---------------

 So the cloud's Lyman alpha absorption line must be observed in the optical.

Thus, the minimal z_cloud is when 1216*(1 + z_cloud) = 4000 Angstroms →

---------------

 z_cloud ≈ 2.29.

So the lower limit is approximately 2.3. The options are C

---------------

) 2.4 and D)1.9. So the correct answer is C)2.4.


To determine the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen such that their Lyman alpha absorption lines can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the situation as follows:

The Lyman alpha wavelength emitted

---------------

 by hydrogen is 1216 Angstroms. When redshifted due to the expansion of the universe, the observed wavelength is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z)
\]

Here, \(\lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Angstroms}\), and \(z\) is the redshift. For the absorption line to be detectable by optical ground-based telescopes, the observed wavelength must fall within the visible spectrum, approximately \(4000 \, \text{Angstroms}\) (or

---------------

 \(400 \, \text{nm}\)), as shorter wavelengths are blocked by atmospheric absorption.

Setting \(\lambda_{\text{obs}} = 4000 \, \text{Angstroms}\), we solve for \(z\):

\[
1216 \cdot (1 + z) = 4000
\]

\[
1 + z = \frac{4000}{1216} \approx 3.289
\]

\[
z \approx 2.289
\]

Thus, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately \(z \approx 2.29\). Among the given options, the closest value above

---------------

 this limit is \(z = 2.4\), corresponding to option C. Option D (\(z = 1.9\)) is too low, as it would result in an observed wavelength still in the ultraviolet, which cannot be detected by ground-based optical telescopes.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
