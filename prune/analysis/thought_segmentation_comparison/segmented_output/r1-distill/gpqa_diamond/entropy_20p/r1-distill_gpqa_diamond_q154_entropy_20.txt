Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z. Hmm, let

---------------

 me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the uncertainty of an observable, like P_z, is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩ - ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩²). So I need to compute the

---------------

 expectation value of P_z and the expectation value of P_z squared, then take the square root of their difference.

Wait, the

---------------

 state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let

---------------

 me write that down. So the state |ψ⟩ is:

|ψ⟩ = [ -1/2,
          1/√2,
         -1/2 ]

But

---------------

 wait, I should check if this is normalized. Let me calculate the sum of the squares of the absolute values. 

(

---------------

 (-1/2)^2 ) + ( (1/√2)^2 ) + ( (-1/2)^2 ) = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) is 1/2, plus 1/2 gives

---------------

 1. Oh, so it's already normalized. That's good because I don't have to worry about normalizing it.

Next

---------------

, I need to compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩. The operator P_z is given as a matrix with first

---------------

 row [ħ, 0, 0], second row [0, 0, 0], third row [0, 0, -ħ]. Let me write that matrix

---------------

 out:

P_z = [ [ ħ, 0, 0 ],
         [ 0, 0, 0 ],
         [ 0, 0, -ħ ] ]

Wait

---------------

, so the diagonal matrix. The eigenstates are the basis vectors, right? So the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So

---------------

, each basis vector corresponds to an eigenstate of P_z.

So to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I can perform the matrix multiplication of

---------------

 ψ† P_z ψ.

Wait, ψ is a column vector, so ψ† is a row vector with

---------------

 complex conjugate entries. But in this case, all the entries are real, so ψ† is just the transpose.

---------------

 So ψ† is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

Now, let

---------------

 me compute ψ† P_z ψ. Let's write it out as a matrix multiplication.

ψ† P_z �

---------------

� = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ] * P_z * [ -1/2,


---------------

                                             1/√2,
                                             -1/2 ]

Alternatively, I can compute it as the sum over the diagonal

---------------

 elements multiplied by the squares of the components, since P_z is diagonal. Because when you multiply ψ† P_z ψ, each

---------------

 term is (ψ_i)^* * (P_z)_ii * ψ_i.

So for each component i, it

---------------

's ψ_i^2 * (P_z)_ii. Because the off-diagonal terms of P_z are zero.

So let

---------------

's compute each term:

i=1: ψ_1 = -1/2, (P_z)_11 = ħ. So term is ( (-1/2)^2 ) * ħ = (1/4) ħ.

i=2: ψ_2 = 1/√2, (P_z)_22 = 0. So term is (1/√2)^2 * 0 = 0.

i=3: ψ_3 = -1/2, (P_z)_33 = -ħ. So term is ( (-1/2)^2 ) * (-ħ) = (1/4)(-ħ) = - ħ/4.

Adding

---------------

 them up: (1/4 ħ) + 0 + (- ħ/4 ) = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.



---------------

Wait, that's interesting. So the expectation value of P_z is zero.

Now, I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩, which is ψ† P_z^2 ψ. Since

---------------

 P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just each diagonal element squared.

So P_z^2 is:

[ [ (ħ)^2, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, (-ħ)^2 ] ] =

---------------

 [ [ ħ², 0, 0 ],
                          [ 0, 0, 0 ],
                          [ 0, 0, ħ² ] ]

Wait

---------------

, because (-ħ)^2 is ħ², same as (ħ)^2.

So now, ⟨P_z²⟩ is again

---------------

 the sum of (ψ_i)^2 * (P_z^2)_ii.

i=1: ( (-1/2)^2 ) * ħ² = (1/4) ħ².

i=2: (1/√2)^2 * 0 = 0.

i=3: ( (-1/2)^2 ) * ħ² = (1/4) ħ².

Adding

---------------

 them: (1/4 + 0 + 1/4 ) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/2) ħ².

Now

---------------

, the variance is ⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2. Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, the variance is just ⟨P_z²⟩,

---------------

 which is (1/2) ħ².

So the uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of the variance:

---------------

 sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (ħ) / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, option B is ħ/

---------------

√2. So the answer should be option B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle \psi | P_z^2 | \psi \rangle - \langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The operator $P_z$ is a diagonal matrix:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Since $P_z$ is diagonal, the expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_{i} \psi_i^2 \cdot P_z^{(i,i)}.
\]

-

---------------

 For $i=1$: $\psi_1^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, and $P_z^{(1,1)} = \hbar$. Contribution: $\frac{1}{4} \hbar$.
- For $i=2$: $\psi_2^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}$, and $P_z^{(2,2)} = 0$. Contribution: $0$.
- For $i=3$: $\psi_3^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, and $P_z^{(3,3)} = -\hbar$. Contribution: $\frac{1}{4}(-\hbar) = -\frac{1}{4}\hbar$.

Adding these contributions:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4}\hbar + 0 - \frac{1}{4}\hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is computed similarly:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_{i} \psi_i^2 \cdot P_z^{(i,i)^2}.
\]

- For $i=1$: $\psi_1^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, and $P_z^{(1,1)^2} = \hbar^2$. Contribution: $\frac{1}{4}\hbar^2$.
- For $i=2$: $\psi_2^2 = \frac{1}{2}$, and $P_z^{(2,2)^2} = 0$. Contribution: $0$.
- For $i=3$: $\psi_3^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, and $P_z^{(3,3)^2} = \hbar^2$. Contribution: $\frac{1}{4}\hbar^2$.

Adding these contributions:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty is given by:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, we have:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
