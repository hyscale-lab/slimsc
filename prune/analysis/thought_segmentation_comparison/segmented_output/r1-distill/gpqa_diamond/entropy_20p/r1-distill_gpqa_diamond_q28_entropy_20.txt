Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read through it again and think step by step.

The question is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are

---------------

 looking for the one that would eliminate the compound.

The intact gene sequence is given, and there are four mutants. Each mutant shows changes in the first exon area. The

---------------

 task is to determine which mutation would likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, I think the goal is to find

---------------

 a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, probably by causing a premature stop codon or altering the protein enough that it doesn't produce the compound.

Looking

---------------

 at the sequences, I'll compare each mutant to the intact gene. I'll need to see where the mutations are and what kind

---------------

 of changes they cause.

Intact gene: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mut

---------------

ant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Mut

---------------

ant 2: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Mutant 3: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Let

---------------

 me break down each mutant:

Starting with the beginning of the sequence, each mutant's first part is compared to the intact gene.

Int

---------------

act: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...



---------------

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...
Hmm

---------------

, let's see the differences. Let's look at each position:

Looking at the first part: ATG is the start codon,

---------------

 same in all. Then, the next few nucleotides:

Intact: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...


---------------

Mutant 1: TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Wait, perhaps it's easier to align

---------------

 the sequences.

Another approach: Let's count the nucleotides where they differ.

For each mutant, let's compare the

---------------

 first part.

Mutant 1:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG G

---------------

AT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...
Mutant1:   ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC...

Wait

---------------

, perhaps I should write out the exact differences.

Let me write the first part of each sequence.

Intact:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...

Mutant1:
ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC...

So

---------------

, comparing the two, I can see where the changes are.

Looking at the first part:

- Position after ATG:

---------------

 Intact has TTT, Mutant1 has TCT (so the second codon is different).
- Then, Int

---------------

act has CTC, Mutant1 has TAC. So, the third codon is different.
- Then, the

---------------

 rest seems to match until later.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for the first differing nucleotide.

Another approach: Let

---------------

 me write each mutant's sequence and the changes.

Mutant 1: The sequence is 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Compar

---------------

ing to the intact gene:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ...


---------------

Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ...

So,

---------------

 the first change is at the third nucleotide (since the first codon is ATG, then the second codon is

---------------

 TTT in intact vs TCT in Mutant1). That would change the amino acids.

So, the second codon in the intact gene is TTT, which is phenylalanine. In Mutant1, it's TCT, which is serine. So

---------------

, the amino acid changes from Phe to Ser.

Then, the third codon in intact is CTC (Leu), but

---------------

 in Mutant1 it's TAC (Tyr). So, two changes here. But wait, I think I need

---------------

 to count each position.

Wait, perhaps I should compare the exact nucleotides.

Looking at the intact gene's first part

---------------

:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...



---------------

Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC...

So, the

---------------

 differences are:

At position 3-5: Intact is TTT, Mutant1 is TCT. So,

---------------

 the second codon changes from TTT (Phe) to TCT (Ser).

At position 6-8: Intact is CTC (Leu), Mutant1 is TAC (Tyr). So, third codon changes from Leu to Tyr.

Wait

---------------

, no, perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong. Let me count the nucleotides.

Intact: positions 1-2

---------------

4: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATG...

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATG...

Looking

---------------

 at each position:

Position 3: Intact has T, Mutant1 has T. Same.

Position 4: Intact has T, Mutant1 has C.

Position

---------------

 5: Intact has C, Mutant1 has T.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to write the exact

---------------

 sequences.

Intact: positions 1-18: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GT

---------------

G GAT GAA

Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA

So, the

---------------

 changes are at positions 4 and 5 (nucleotide-wise), but in codons, that's the second and third codons.

So

---------------

, second codon in intact is TTT (Phe), in Mutant1 it's TCT (Ser). Third codon in

---------------

 intact is CTC (Leu), in Mutant1 it's TAC (Tyr). So, two amino acid changes,

---------------

 but no stop codon.

Hmm, so that's a missense mutation in two positions.

What about the other mutants?

Mutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Compar

---------------

ing to intact:

Intact: ... TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ...
Mutant2: TCT TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT ...

So, the

---------------

 second codon in intact is TTT (Phe) in Mutant2 it's TCT (Ser), third codon C

---------------

TC (Leu) becomes TAA (stop codon?), but wait, the third codon in Mutant2 is T

---------------

AA.

Wait, in the intact gene, the third codon is CTC (Leu), but in Mutant2, it

---------------

's TAA. Let's see: TAA is a stop codon (amber). Oh, wait, that's a

---------------

 big deal.

So, in Mutant2, the third codon is TAA, which is a stop codon. That would cause

---------------

 the translation to terminate early, leading to a truncated protein. If the gene product is responsible for the anti-nutritional compound, then

---------------

 a truncated protein might not function, thus reducing or eliminating the compound. So, this could be a good candidate.

Wait, let me double

---------------

-check. In Mutant2's sequence, after ATG, the next codons are TCT (Ser), then TAA (stop). So the protein

---------------

 would be much shorter. That's a nonsense mutation, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

What about Mutant3:

Mutant3: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Compar

---------------

ing to intact:

Intact: ... TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ...
Mutant3: TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT ...

Wait, let

---------------

 me line it up.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...
Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...

Wait

---------------

, no. Let me look at the sequences:

Intact: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATG

---------------

...
Mutant3: ...TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACTTCTGTGGATG...

So

---------------

, the third codon in Mutant3 is TAC (Tyr), whereas in intact it's CTC (Leu). So

---------------

, that's a change from Leu to Tyr. Then, the next codon in intact is GCT (Ala), in

---------------

 Mutant3 it's GTC (Val). So, another change.

So, Mutant3 has two amino acid changes,

---------------

 but no stop codon. So, the protein is still made but altered. It depends on whether these changes disrupt the function. However

---------------

, without a premature stop, the protein might still be produced, but perhaps not functional. Alternatively, maybe it's still made

---------------

, but the anti-nutrient is still present. So, this might not eliminate the compound unless the changes disrupt the active

---------------

 site.

Mutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
So

---------------

, comparing to intact:

Intact: ... TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ...
Mutant4: TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT ...

Wait, in

---------------

 Mutant4, after the TTT (Phe), the next codon is TAC (Tyr), and the one

---------------

 after is GCT (Ala) in intact, but in Mutant4, it's ACT (Thr). So, the

---------------

 fourth codon is changed.

Wait, let me see:

Intact: ...TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...
Mutant4: ...TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So, the

---------------

 third codon in intact is CTC (Leu), in Mutant4 it's TAC (Tyr). Fourth

---------------

 codon in intact is GCT (Ala), in Mutant4 it's ACT (Thr). So, two amino acid changes again

---------------

. No stop codon, so the protein is still produced. But if the changes are in a critical region, the function may be disrupted. However

---------------

, without a stop codon, it's less likely to completely eliminate the compound compared to a null mutation.

So, back

---------------

 to the options. The question is which mutation will eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The best way is probably to disrupt

---------------

 the gene's function, which can be done by introducing a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) or a frameshift leading

---------------

 to a completely different downstream sequence.

Looking at the mutants:

Mutant2 has a TAA codon, which is a stop. So, the

---------------

 mRNA would be translated until that point, resulting in a much shorter protein. If the anti-nutritional compound is produced by the full-length protein, then

---------------

 a truncated version might not produce it. Alternatively, the gene might be nonfunctional, so the compound isn't synthesized.

Mut

---------------

ant4: Let's see, after the TTT, it's TAC and then ACT. So, the third codon is TAC (Tyr), fourth

---------------

 is ACT (Thr). No stop codon.

Wait, but looking again at Mutant2: the third codon is TAA,

---------------

 which is a stop. So, the protein would be shorter. So, if the gene's function requires the entire protein, the

---------------

 anti-nutritional compound might not be made. So, Mutant2 could be the answer.

Wait, another point: the

---------------

 question says the gene has five exons and four introns. But since the mutations are in the first exon, the mRNA

---------------

 would include that exon. So, the changes are in the coding region.

Now, which mutation would cause a frameshift? Let

---------------

's see.

Looking at the sequences, all the mutants only have point mutations, not insertions or deletions. So, no

---------------

 frameshifts. So, all are missense or nonsense mutations.

So, Mutant2 introduces a stop codon in

---------------

 the third codon. That would cause the protein to be about 1/3 shorter. That's a strong candidate for a

---------------

 loss-of-function mutation.

Mutant4: the sequence after the changes continues, but the question is whether the change leads to a stop

---------------

. No, in Mutant4, the third codon is TAC (Tyr), which is fine. No stop.



---------------

So, the best bet is Mutant2, which introduces a premature stop. So, the protein is not made correctly, so

---------------

 the anti-nutritional compound isn't synthesized.

Wait, but what about the other possibilities? Let me check each.

Mutant1: Two

---------------

 amino acid changes. Maybe the protein is still functional, so the compound remains. So, this won't eliminate it.

Mutant3: Two changes,

---------------

 but no stop. So, the protein might be altered but perhaps still functional. Or maybe not. It depends on which amino

---------------

 acids are changed. Without a stop, the compound might still be present.

Mutant4: Two changes, but again, no

---------------

 stop. So, same as Mutant3.

So, the only one that causes a stop is Mutant2. So

---------------

, that's the one that would eliminate the compound.


To determine which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, we analyze the mutations

---------------

 in the first exon of the gene. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, either by introducing a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) or significantly altering the protein's

---------------

 structure (missense mutation). Here's the analysis of each mutant:

### Intact Gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’  
- **

---------------

Key Features**: No mutations; the full-length protein is synthesized.

### Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’  
- **Changes**:  
  - Second codon: TTT (Phe) → TCT (Ser)  
  - Third codon: CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr)  
- **Outcome**: Two amino acid changes (Ser and Tyr instead of Phe and Leu). The protein is altered but not truncated. Likely functional, so the anti-nutritional compound may still be produced.

### Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’  
- **Changes**:  
  - Second codon: TTT (Phe) → TCT (Ser)  
  - Third codon: CTC (Leu) → TAA (Stop)  
- **Outcome**: A premature stop codon (amber codon, TAA) is introduced after

---------------

 the second codon. This results in a truncated protein. If the full-length protein is required for the anti-nutritional compound, this mutation would likely eliminate its production.

### Mutant 3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’  
- **Changes**:  
  - Third codon: CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr)  
  - Fourth codon: GCT (Ala) → GTC (Val)  
- **Outcome**: Two amino acid changes (Tyr and Val instead of Leu and Ala). The protein is altered but not truncated. Depending

---------------

 on the critical residues required for function, the compound may still be produced.

### Mutant 4:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’  
- **Changes**:  
  - Third codon: CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr)  
  - Fourth codon: GCT (Ala) → ACT (Thr)  
- **Outcome**: Two amino acid changes (Tyr and Thr instead of Leu and Ala). The protein is altered but not truncated. Similar to Mutant 3, the compound may still be produced unless the changes disrupt a critical functional region.

### Conclusion:
The most effective mutation for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound is **Mutant 2**, as it introduces a premature stop codon (TAA), resulting in a truncated and nonfunctional protein. This strongly

---------------

 suggests that the compound will not be synthesized.
