Okay, so I have this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me think through it step by step.

The

---------------

 problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then

---------------

 it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of their rest masses. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M.

So

---------------

, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. That means after fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So

---------------

, the velocities of the two fragments would be such that their momenta cancel each other out.

The kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. The question is asking about the difference between the correct T1 (rel

---------------

ativistic) and the one calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, right. So I need to find

---------------

 T1 relativistically and compare it with the classical T1. The difference would be the relativistic correction.

Let me break

---------------

 it down. First, let's get the rest masses of the two fragments. Let me denote them as m1 and m2. According

---------------

 to the problem, m1 is twice m2. So, m1 = 2 m2.

Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Substituting m1 =

---------------

 2 m2 into that equation:

2 m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M =>

---------------

 m2 = (0.99/3) M = 0.33 M.

So m1 = 2 * 0.33 M = 0.66 M.

Wait, but

---------------

 M is the initial mass. So the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. But in relativity, energy

---------------

 isn't just the rest mass; there's kinetic energy too. But in this problem, I think the initial nucleus is at rest, so its total energy is just

---------------

 its rest mass energy, 300 GeV.

After fission, the two fragments have rest mass energies and kinetic energies. So

---------------

 the total energy after must be the sum of their rest energies plus their kinetic energies. But because the initial nucleus is at rest, the total energy before

---------------

 is 300 GeV, so after fission, the total energy is also 300 GeV.

---------------

 So the sum of the rest masses plus the kinetic energies equals 300 GeV.

Wait, but the sum of the rest masses is 0.99 M.

---------------

 Wait, no, the sum of the rest masses is 0.99 M, but M is the initial mass. Wait

---------------

, no, the initial rest mass is M, and the sum of the two fragments' rest masses is 0.99 M. So

---------------

 the initial rest mass is M, which is 300 GeV. So the sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 0.99 M, which is 0.99 * 

---------------

300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the initial energy is 300 GeV, so

---------------

 the sum of the kinetic energies of the two fragments must be 3 GeV.

But wait, that's the total kinetic energy.

---------------

 But how is that divided between the two fragments?

Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum is zero. So the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. So

---------------

 p1 = -p2. But since momentum is gamma m v, their velocities and masses will determine this.

Wait, but

---------------

 for relativistic speeds, it's not just mass times velocity. Hmm, this could get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the concept

---------------

 of invariant mass or energy-momentum relations.

Wait, the problem is about the difference between relativistic and classical kinetic energy. So

---------------

 perhaps I can first calculate the classical T1, then the relativistic T1, and find their difference.

Wait, but

---------------

 in the classical case, we're assuming non-relativistic speeds, so kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². But

---------------

 wait, in reality, the velocities here might be significant fractions of the speed of light, so relativistic effects matter. So

---------------

 the classical approximation would ignore relativistic effects, probably leading to a lower kinetic energy than the actual relativistic value.

Wait, but

---------------

 the question is about the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1. So I need to compute both and subtract.

But

---------------

 how?

Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine the rest masses of the two fragments.
2. Use conservation of energy and momentum to find their velocities.


---------------

3. Compute the kinetic energy in the relativistic case.
4. Compute the kinetic energy using the classical approximation.
5. Find the difference.



---------------

But this might be a bit involved. Let's start with the rest masses.

We have m1 = 0.66 M and m2 = 0.33 M.

Wait

---------------

, but M is the initial rest mass, which is 300 GeV/c². But in the problem, the

---------------

 rest mass energy is 300 GeV, so M c² = 300 GeV, so M = 300 GeV / c². Hmm

---------------

, but perhaps it's easier to work in units where c=1, so M is 300 GeV.

But

---------------

 for the rest masses, m1 is 0.66 * M = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV,

---------------

 and m2 is 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.

Wait no, wait

---------------

. Because the sum of the rest masses is 0.99 M, which is 297 GeV. So

---------------

 m1 is 0.66 M (198 GeV) and m2 is 0.33 M (99 GeV).

---------------

 So their rest mass energies are 198 GeV and 99 GeV respectively.

So the total rest mass energy

---------------

 after fission is 297 GeV, leaving 3 GeV as the total kinetic energy of both fragments.

But

---------------

 how is that 3 GeV split between T1 and T2? Well, in the center-of-momentum frame, which

---------------

 is the rest frame of the initial nucleus, the two fragments will have equal and opposite momenta.

So the total momentum is

---------------

 zero.

Let me denote the velocities of the fragments as v1 and v2. Since momentum is gamma m v, and

---------------

 m1 = 2 m2, but the momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2,

---------------

 but with opposite signs. But since v1 and v2 are in opposite directions, perhaps it's easier to take magnitudes.



---------------

Wait, let's say m1 is moving to the right, m2 to the left. So p1 = gamma1 m1 v1, p2 = gamma2 m2 v2. But

---------------

 since p1 = - p2, so gamma1 m1 v1 = - gamma2 m2 v2.

Taking

---------------

 magnitudes, gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But because the problem is symmetric, perhaps

---------------

 the velocities are related via the masses. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to work with energies and velocities.



---------------

But maybe another approach: Since the total energy is 300 GeV, and the rest mass is 297 GeV, the total

---------------

 kinetic energy is 3 GeV.

But wait, no. Wait, the total rest mass is 297 GeV, but

---------------

 the initial rest mass is 300 GeV. So the total energy after fission is 300 GeV,

---------------

 which is the same as before.

So the sum of the rest masses plus the kinetic energies is 300 GeV.

So

---------------

 (m1 + m2) c² + (T1 + T2) = M c².

But m1 + m2 = 0.99 M, so 

---------------

0.99 M c² + (T1 + T2) = M c².

So T1 + T2 = M c² (1 - 0.99) = 0.01 M c² = 3 GeV.

So

---------------

 the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV. Now, how is this split between T1 and T2?

In the center

---------------

-of-momentum frame, the two fragments have equal and opposite momenta. So, their velocities are such that m1 v1 = m2 v2 (

---------------

considering magnitudes, since they are opposite in direction).

Wait, but relativistically, momentum is gamma m v. So for

---------------

 the two fragments, their momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So:

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2

But

---------------

 m1 = 2 m2, so:

gamma1 (2 m2) v1 = gamma2 m2 v2

Div

---------------

ide both sides by m2:

2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2

Hmm, but that's getting complicated. Maybe

---------------

 it's better to find the velocities in terms of each other.

Wait, let me make the assumption that in the non-relativistic case, the

---------------

 velocities would be related by v1 = -2 v2, because m1 = 2 m2, so to conserve momentum,

---------------

 m1 v1 = m2 v2. So if m1 is twice m2, then v1 would be (m2/(2 m2)) v2 =

---------------

 (1/2) v2. Wait, but that's for non-relativistic. Hmm, perhaps I should think

---------------

 about that.

Wait, non-relativistic momentum is p = m v. So for the two fragments, p1 = m1 v1, p2 = m2 v2. Since

---------------

 p1 = -p2, m1 v1 = -m2 v2. So v2 = -(m1/m2) v1. Since m1 = 2 m2, v2 = -(2 m2 / m2) v1 = -2 v1.

So in

---------------

 non-relativistic case, the velocity of m2 is twice that of m1 in the opposite direction.

But in the relativistic case, the

---------------

 velocities are not simply related by their masses because of the gamma factors.

Hmm. So perhaps for the relativistic case, the

---------------

 velocities are not so straightforward.

But maybe there's a better approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the system's total energy and momentum.



---------------

The initial nucleus is at rest, so total energy is M c² = 300 GeV, and total momentum is zero.

After fission, the two fragments have energies E1 and E2, and

---------------

 momenta p1 and p2.

So,

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

p1 + p2 = 0 =>

---------------

 p2 = -p1.

Each energy E is related to momentum and mass by E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So,



---------------

E1² = (p1 c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2,

E2² = (p2 c)^2 + (m2 c²)^2.

But p2 = -p1, so E

---------------

2² = (p1 c)^2 + (m2 c²)^2.

So,

E1² = p1² c² + m1² c^4,

E2² = p1² c² + m2² c^4.

Adding

---------------

 E1 and E2:

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

But this seems a bit tricky

---------------

. Let me substitute m1 and m2.

We have m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M.

So

---------------

,

E1² = p1² c^4 + (0.66 M c²)^2,

E2² = p1² c^4 + (0.33 M c²)^2.

And

---------------

 E1 + E2 = 300 GeV = M c².

Hmm. Let me denote x = p1 c²

---------------

.

So,

E1² = x² + (0.66 M c²)^2,

E2² = x² + (0.33 M c²)^2.

And

---------------

 E1 + E2 = M c².

Wait, but M c² is 300 GeV, so

---------------

 E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to write E1 and E2 in terms of x.

But

---------------

 this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I can square the sum and use the expressions for E1² and E2².

Let

---------------

 me write (E1 + E2)^2 = E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2 = (300 GeV)^2.

Sub

---------------

stituting E1² and E2²,

(x² + (0.66 M c²)^2) + 2 E1 E2 + (x² + (0.33 M c²)^2) = (300 GeV)^2.

S

---------------

implify:

2 x² + (0.66^2 + 0.33^2) (M c²)^2 + 2 E1 E2 = (300 GeV)^2.

Calculate

---------------

 0.66^2 + 0.33^2:

0.66^2 = 0.4356,

0.33^2 = 0.1089,

Sum

---------------

 is 0.5445.

So,

2 x² + 0.5445 (300 GeV)^2 + 2 E1 E2 = (300 GeV)^2.

Wait

---------------

, but 300 GeV is M c². So,

2 x² + 0.5445 (M c²)^2 + 2 E1 E2 = (M c²)^2.

Sub

---------------

tract 0.5445 (M c²)^2 from both sides:

2 x² + 2 E1 E2 = (M c²)^2 (1 - 0.5445) ) 



---------------

Which is,

2 x² + 2 E1 E2 = 0.4555 (M c²)^2.

Hmm

---------------

, but I'm not sure if this is getting me closer to the solution. Maybe I need another equation.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 I can express E1 and E2 in terms of x.

Wait, E1 = sqrt(x² + (0.66 M c²)^2 )



---------------

E2 = sqrt(x² + (0.33 M c²)^2 )

And E1 + E2 = M c².

This

---------------

 seems like a system of equations. Let me let y = x / (M c²).

Then, E1 = M c² sqrt( y² + (0.66)^2 )

E2 = M c² sqrt( y² + (0.33)^2 )

So

---------------

,

sqrt( y² + 0.4356 ) + sqrt( y² + 0.1089 ) = 1.

Because

---------------

 E1 + E2 = M c², and each E is scaled by M c².

Let me denote A = sqrt( y² + 0.4356 ), B = sqrt( y² + 0.1089 ).



---------------

So, A + B = 1.

Let me square both sides:

A² + 2 A B + B² = 1.

But A² = y² + 0.4356,

B² = y² + 0.1089.

So,

(y² + 0.4356) + 2 A B + (y² + 0.1089) = 1.

Combine

---------------

 terms:

2 y² + 0.5445 + 2 A B = 1.

So,

2 y² + 2 A B = 0.4555.

Hmm

---------------

, but this still includes A and B, which are sqrt terms. Maybe I can express A B in terms of y.

A

---------------

 B = sqrt( (y² + 0.4356)(y² + 0.1089) )

Hmm

---------------

, not sure. Let me try plugging in some numbers.

Wait, let me assume y is small. Because if the velocities

---------------

 are not too high, y would be small. Let's see.

If y is small, then:

A ≈ sqrt(0.4356) = 0.66,

B ≈ sqrt(0.1089) = 0.33.

So,

---------------

 A + B = 0.66 + 0.33 = 0.99, which is less than 1. So we

---------------

 need to adjust y to make A + B =1.

So, let's try y^2 = some value.

Wait

---------------

, perhaps it's better to make a substitution. Let me let u = y².

So,

A = sqrt( u + 0.4356 )

B = sqrt( u + 0.1089 )

We

---------------

 have:

sqrt(u + 0.4356) + sqrt(u + 0.1089) = 1.

Let me denote

---------------

 S = sqrt(u + 0.4356) + sqrt(u + 0.1089) = 1.

Let

---------------

 me square both sides:

(u + 0.4356) + 2 sqrt( (u + 0.4356)(u + 0.1089) ) + (u + 0.1089) = 1.

Combine

---------------

 terms:

2u + 0.5445 + 2 sqrt( (u + 0.4356)(u + 0.1089) ) = 1.

Sub

---------------

tract 2u + 0.5445:

2 sqrt( (u + 0.4356)(u + 0.1089) ) = 1 - (2u + 0.5445).



---------------

Square again:

4 (u + 0.4356)(u + 0.1089) = [1 - 2u - 0.5445]^2.

Compute

---------------

 the RHS:

1 - 2u - 0.5445 = (0.4555 - 2u).

So,

---------------

 RHS is (0.4555 - 2u)^2.

LHS: 4 (u^2 + 0.4356 u + 0.1089 u + 0.4356 * 0.1089 )

S

---------------

implify inside:

u^2 + (0.4356 + 0.1089) u + (0.04749

---------------

) → u^2 + 0.5445 u + 0.04749.

So LHS is

---------------

 4 (u^2 + 0.5445 u + 0.04749)

---------------

 = 4u² + 2.178 u + 0.18996.

RHS: (0.4555 - 2u)^2 = ( -

---------------

2u + 0.4555 )^2 = 4u² - 2 * 2u * 0.4555 + (0.4555)^2.

Which

---------------

 is 4u² - 1.822 u + 0.2075.

So equation becomes:

4u² + 2.178 u + 0.18996 = 4u² - 1.822 u + 0.2075.

Subtract 4u² from both sides:

2.178 u + 0.18996 = -1.822 u + 0.2075.

Bring all terms to left:

2.178 u + 1.822 u + 0.18996 - 0.2075 = 0.

Which

---------------

 is (4 u) + (-0.01754) = 0.

So 4u = 0.01754 → u = 0.01754 /4 = 0.004385.

So u = y² = 0.004385 → y = sqrt(0.004385) ≈ 0.0662.

So y

---------------

 ≈ 0.0662.

Now, we can find x = y (M c²) → x

---------------

 = 0.0662 * 300 GeV ≈ 19.86 GeV.

Wait

---------------

, but x is p c. So p = x / c → but perhaps in units where c=1, p = x.

Wait

---------------

, so p1 = x = 19.86 GeV.

Now, let's compute E1 and E2.

E1 = sqrt( (19.86 GeV)^2 + (0.66 * 300 GeV)^2 )

Calculate

---------------

 0.66 *300 = 198 GeV.

So,

E1 = sqrt( (19.86)^2 + (198)^2 ) GeV.

(

---------------

19.86)^2 ≈ 394.4, (198)^2 = 39204.

So sum

---------------

 is 394.4 + 39204 = 39598.4 → sqrt(39598.4) ≈ 198.99 Ge

---------------

V.

Similarly, E2 = sqrt( (19.86)^2 + (99)^2 ) GeV.

(99)^2 =9801.



---------------

So sum is 394.4 +9801 = 10195.4 → sqrt ≈ 100.97 GeV.

So

---------------

 E1 ≈ 198.99 GeV, E2 ≈ 100.97 GeV.

Check

---------------

 E1 + E2 = 198.99 + 100.97 = 300 GeV, which matches.

So

---------------

 the kinetic energy T1 is E1 - m1 c² = 198.99 GeV - 198 GeV = 0.99 GeV.



---------------

Wait, that's 990 MeV? That can't be right because the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV.



---------------

Wait, because E1 + E2 is 300 GeV, and m1 + m2 is 297 GeV, so the

---------------

 total KE is 3 GeV. So T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

Wait, but according to my

---------------

 calculation, T1 is 0.99 GeV and T2 is 0.97 GeV, which

---------------

 sums to 1.96 GeV, which is less than 3. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation

---------------

.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, E1 = 198.99 GeV, which is m

---------------

1 c² (198 GeV) plus T1. So T1 = E1 - 198 GeV = 0.99 GeV.

Similarly, E2 = 100.97 GeV,

---------------

 which is m2 c² (99 GeV) plus T2. So T2 = 1.97 GeV.

So

---------------

 T1 = 0.99 GeV, T2 = 1.97 GeV. Sum is 2.96 GeV, which is close

---------------

 to 3 GeV. Probably due to rounding errors in the calculation.

So the correct T1 is approximately 0.99 GeV,

---------------

 which is 990 MeV.

Now, what's the classical approximation? In the non-relativistic case, the

---------------

 kinetic energy would be (1/2) m v².

But how do I find the velocities classically?

In the classical case, the

---------------

 momentum is conserved, so m1 v1 = - m2 v2.

But m1 = 2 m2 → v1 = - (m2 / m1) v2 = - (1/2) v2.

Wait

---------------

, but since they move in opposite directions, perhaps I can model the velocities as v1 and v2 in opposite directions,

---------------

 but with magnitudes v and 2v.

Wait, let me think again.

In the non-relativistic case, the

---------------

 momentum of the more massive fragment (m1) would be m1 v1, and the momentum of the lighter (m2) would be m2 v2. Since

---------------

 they must cancel, m1 v1 = - m2 v2.

Because m1 = 2 m2, so

---------------

 2 m2 v1 = - m2 v2 → 2 v1 = - v2.

So v2 = -2 v1.

So

---------------

 the velocities are v1 and v2 = -2 v1.

The kinetic energies would be (1/2) m1 v1² and (1/2) m2 v2².

So

---------------

,

T1_classical = (1/2) m1 v1²,

T2_classical = (1/2) m2 ( (

---------------

2 v1)^2 ) = (1/2) m2 (4 v1²) = 2 m2 v1².

But

---------------

 m1 = 2 m2,

So,

T1_classical = (1/2) (2 m2) v1² = m2 v1².

T2_classical = 2 m2 v1².

So T

---------------

1_classical = m2 v1²,

T2_classical = 2 m2 v1².

Sum T

---------------

1 + T2 = 3 m2 v1² = 3 GeV.

So,

3 m2 v1² = 3 GeV → m2 v1² = 1 GeV.

But

---------------

 m2 = 99 GeV / c². Wait, no, m2 is 0.33 M, and

---------------

 M is 300 GeV/c². So m2 = 0.33 * 300 GeV/c² = 99 GeV/c².

But

---------------

 in the non-relativistic case, kinetic energy is (1/2) m v². So, for the more

---------------

 massive fragment, T1_classical is (1/2) m1 v1².

Wait, but in the non

---------------

-relativistic case, we can express v1 in terms of the momentum.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to use

---------------

 the fact that the total momentum is zero.

In the non-relativistic case, the momentum of each fragment is p = m v.

So,



---------------

p1 = m1 v1,

p2 = m2 v2.

Since p1 = -p2,

m1 v1 = - m2 v2.

As

---------------

 before, v2 = -(m1/m2) v1 = -(2 m2 / m2) v1 = -2 v1.

So v

---------------

2 = -2 v1.

So, the kinetic energies would be:

T1 = (1/2) m1 v1²,

T2 = (1/2) m2 (2

---------------

 v1)^2 = (1/2) m2 4 v1² = 2 m2 v1².

Sum

---------------

 T1 + T2 = (1/2 m1 v1²) + 2 m2 v1².

But

---------------

 m1 = 2 m2, so,

= (1/2 * 2 m2 v1²) + 2 m2 v1² =

---------------

 m2 v1² + 2 m2 v1² = 3 m2 v1².

Which equals 3 GeV.



---------------

So,

3 m2 v1² = 3 GeV → m2 v1² = 1 GeV.

So

---------------

,

v1² = (1 GeV) / m2.

But m2 = 99 GeV / c² →

---------------

 v1² = (1 GeV) / (99 GeV / c²) ) → v1² = c² / 99.

So

---------------

,

v1 = c / sqrt(99) ≈ c * 0.1005.

So,

---------------

 v1 ≈ 0.1005 c.

Now, T1_classical = (1/2) m1 v1².

m

---------------

1 = 2 m2 = 2 * 99 GeV / c² = 198 GeV / c².

v1² = (c²)/99.

So,

T1_classical = (1/2) * (198 GeV/c²) * (c² /99)

---------------

 )

= (1/2) * 198 GeV/c² * c² /99.

The c² cancels,



---------------

= (1/2) * (198 /99 ) GeV.

198/99 = 2.



---------------

So,

T1_classical = (1/2) * 2 GeV = 1 GeV.

So,

---------------

 in the classical approximation, T1 is 1 GeV.

But earlier, in the relativistic calculation, T1 was approximately 0.99 GeV.

Wait, but

---------------

 that's the opposite of what I expected. Because in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is lower than the classical case

---------------

? Or did I make a mistake.

Wait, wait, no. Because in the relativistic case, the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, which

---------------

 is split into T1 ≈ 0.99 GeV and T2 ≈ 2.01 GeV (

---------------

summing to about 3 GeV). But in the classical case, T1 is 1 GeV and T2 is 2 GeV, sum

---------------

ming to 3 GeV.

So, the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1 would be 0.99 GeV - 1 GeV = -0.01 GeV,

---------------

 which is -10 MeV. But since the question asks for the difference, perhaps the absolute value is 10 MeV.

Wait, but wait

---------------

, in the relativistic case, T1 is 0.99 GeV, which is 990 MeV. The classical T

---------------

1 is 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV. So the difference is 10 MeV.

---------------

 So the correct T1 is 10 MeV less than the classical value.

Wait, but wait, according to my

---------------

 earlier calculation, T1 is 0.99 GeV, which is 990 MeV. The classical T

---------------

1 is 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV. So the correct T1 is 10 MeV less than the classical approximation

---------------

. So the difference is 10 MeV.

But the question says, what is the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1?

---------------

 So, correct T1 is 990 MeV, classical is 1000 MeV. So the

---------------

 difference is 10 MeV. So the correct T1 is 10 MeV less than the classical value.

But

---------------

 wait, the options are A) 2 MeV, B)5, C)10, D)20.

So the difference is 10 MeV. So the answer is option C)

---------------

 10 MeV.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I might have made a mistake in the relativistic calculation.

---------------

 Let me double-check.

In the relativistic case, I found that E1 was approximately 198.99 GeV, so

---------------

 T1 = E1 - m1 c² = 198.99 - 198 = 0.99 GeV.

---------------

 So that's 990 MeV.

In the classical case, T1 was 1 GeV (1000 MeV).

So the correct T1 is 990 MeV, the

---------------

 classical is 1000 MeV. The difference is 10 MeV. So the correct T1 is 10 MeV less than the classical value

---------------

. So the difference between correct and classical is 10 MeV.

So the answer is option C) 10 MeV.


To solve the problem, we analyze the nuclear fission process and compare the relativistic and classical kinetic energies of the more massive fragment.

### Key Information:
1. **Initial Setup

---------------

**:  
   - The initial nucleus has a rest mass energy of \( 300 \, \text{GeV} \).  
   - After fission, the nucleus splits into two fragments:  
     - Fragment 1 (more massive): \( m_1 = 0.66M \)  
     - Fragment 2 (less massive): \( m_2 = 0.33M \)  
   - The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is \( 0.99M \), leaving \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \) as the total kinetic energy of the system.

2. **Relativistic Kinetic Energy**:  
   - The total energy of each fragment is the sum of its rest mass energy and kinetic energy:  
     \[
     E_1 = \sqrt{(p_1 c)^2 + (m_1 c^2)^2}, \quad E_2 = \sqrt{(p_2 c)^2 + (m_2 c^2)^2}
     \]
   - Using conservation of momentum (\( p_1 = -p_2 \)) and energy (\( E_1 + E_2 = 300 \, \text{GeV} \)), the momentum

---------------

 \( p_1 \) is solved iteratively.  
   - The relativistic kinetic energy of Fragment 1 is:  
     \[
     T_1 = E_1 - m_1 c^2
     \]
   - After calculations, \( T_1 \) is found to be approximately \( 0.99 \, \text{GeV} \) or \( 990 \, \text{MeV} \).

3. **Classical Kinetic Energy**:  
   - In the non-relativistic approximation, kinetic energy is given by \( T = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \).  
   - Using conservation of momentum (\( m_1 v_1 = -m_2 v_2 \)) and the total kinetic energy (\( T_1 + T_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \)), the velocities of the fragments are determined.  
   - The classical kinetic energy of Fragment 1 is calculated as \( T_1 = 1 \, \text{GeV} \) or \( 1000 \, \text{MeV} \).

4. **Difference Between Relativistic and Classical \( T_1 \)**:  
   - The relativistic \( T_1 \) is \( 990 \, \text{MeV} \), and the classical \( T_1 \) is \( 1000 \, \text{MeV} \).  
   - The difference is:  
     \[
     \Delta T_1 = |T_{1, \text{relativistic}} - T_{1, \text{classical}}| = |990 - 1000| = 10 \, \text{MeV}.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The difference between the correct relativistic \( T_1 \) and the classical \( T_1 \) is \( 10 \, \text{MeV} \).
