Okay, so I've got this question about nucleophilicity in aqueous solution. Hmm, I need to arrange these five nucleophiles from the most reactive to the least. Let me think about

---------------

 what I know about nucleophilicity.

First, the nucleophiles given are:
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. Hydroxide (OH-)
3. Propionate (CH2CH2COO- maybe?

---------------

 Or is it just CH3CH2COO-?)
4. Methanol (CH3OH)
5. Ethanethiolate (CH

---------------

3CH2S-)

Wait, but wait, I should probably write them all out properly. So, 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a cyclohexoxide ion

---------------

 with a methyl group in the 4 position. Hydroxide is OH-. Propionate is the conjugate base of propionic acid, so it

---------------

's CH2CH2COO- or CH3CH2COO-? Either way, it's an acetate derivative. Methanol is CH

---------------

3OH, which is a neutral molecule. Ethanethiolate is CH3CH2S-.

Now, I remember that nucleophilicity can

---------------

 depend on the solvent. The question says aqueous solution, so it's in water. In a polar aprotic solvent, the

---------------

 order is usually based on basicity because the solvent doesn't stabilize the ions as much. But in a polar protic solvent like water, sol

---------------

vation plays a big role. Stronger bases are better nucleophiles in aprotic solvents, but in protic solvents, the

---------------

 more polarizable ions (like S- over O-) and the ability to shed solvent molecules matter more.

Wait, but wait

---------------

. In aqueous solution, the solvent is water, which is a polar protic solvent. So the nucleophilicity order

---------------

 can be a bit different from the basicity order. For example, in aqueous solution, thiols are better nucleophiles than hydroxide because they

---------------

're less solvated. Because S is bigger, so it can donate electrons better and is less tightly held by the solvent.

So

---------------

, looking at the nucleophiles:

Ethanethiolate (5) is a good nucleophile because S- is a weaker

---------------

 base than O- but in a protic solvent, it's a better nucleophile. Wait, no, actually, in

---------------

 a protic solvent, the nucleophilicity order is usually: weaker bases are better because they're less solvated. Wait

---------------

, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. In polar aprotic solvents, the order is based

---------------

 on basicity, so stronger bases are better nucleophiles. In polar protic solvents, the solvent can stabilize the nucle

---------------

ophile through solvation. So stronger bases (like OH-) are more stabilized, making them less nucleophilic. So in

---------------

 a protic solvent, the order is opposite in a way.

Wait, for example, in aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity for

---------------

 common nucleophiles is usually: I- > Br- > Cl- > F- (because F- is a stronger base and more

---------------

 solvated), but wait, that's for halides. But for O and S nucleophiles, what's the deal

---------------

?

Sulfide ions (S^2- is a stronger base than OH-), but in aqueous solution, the

---------------

 order is different. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in protic solvents, the more polarizable the nucleophile, the better. S

---------------

ulfur is more polarizable than oxygen. So ethanethiolate (5) should be a better nucleophile than hydroxide (2) in aqueous solution.

Wait

---------------

, but also, the strength of the base might influence this. For example, OH- is a stronger base than CH3O- because

---------------

 it's less stabilized. But in aqueous solution, stronger bases are less nucleophilic because they are more solvated.

Wait

---------------

, but in the case of O- and S-: OH- is a stronger base than SH-, right? Because H

---------------

2O is a weaker acid than H2S. So, in a protic solvent, which is more nucleophilic between

---------------

 OH- and SH-? I think SH- is a better nucleophile in protic solvents because it's less solvated.

---------------

 Because S is bigger, it can form weaker bonds with the solvent, making it more available to attack.

So in this case, the

---------------

 order between 5 (ethanethiolate) and 2 (hydroxide) would have 5 being more reactive.



---------------

Next, looking at the other nucleophiles. Number 1 is 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate. That's an alkoxide ion, similar

---------------

 to OH-, but in a more substituted position. So, cyclohexoxide. How does its nucleophilicity compare to hydro

---------------

xide?

Well, in aprotic solvents, larger, more substituted alcohols (like tert-butoxide) are better nucleophiles because they're stronger

---------------

 bases. But in protic solvents, the solvation effect is more important. So, in aqueous solution, more

---------------

 substituted alcohols (like tert-butoxide) are more stabilized (because they're stronger bases) but that makes

---------------

 them less nucleophilic.

Wait, but cyclohexoxide is a conjugate base of a secondary alcohol. So compared

---------------

 to hydroxide, which is a primary base, how does that affect things? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the steric effects

---------------

 play a role. 4-Methylcyclohexanolate has a bulky structure. So, in a substitution reaction, a

---------------

 bulky nucleophile might be less reactive because it's harder for the nucleophile to approach the electrophilic center.

Wait

---------------

, but when considering nucleophilicity in a solution, steric effects are more about the reaction's success once the nucleophile is near

---------------

 the electrophile. So in a solution, without the electrophile, how does the bulk affect the overall reactivity as

---------------

 a nucleophile? Maybe it's more about the solvation and basicity.

Wait, another approach: the strength of the conjugate acid.

---------------

 Stronger acids have weaker conjugate bases. So, in aqueous solution, the weaker the base, the less it's stabilized by solvation, so

---------------

 the more nucleophilic it is. Wait, no: stronger bases are more stabilized by solvation, making them less nucleophilic. So,

---------------

 weaker bases are better nucleophiles in protic solvents.

Wait, let's think: the conjugate acid of OH

---------------

- is H2O. The pKa of water is about 15.7. The conjugate acid of CH

---------------

3CH2S- is H2S, pKa around 7. So, H2S is a stronger acid than H2O, which

---------------

 means that S- is a weaker base than OH-.

So, OH- is a stronger base than S-.

In a polar aprotic solvent, stronger

---------------

 bases are better nucleophiles. So OH- would be a better nucleophile than S-.

But in a polar protic solvent, the

---------------

 more the nucleophile is stabilized by solvation (i.e., the stronger the base), the less available it is to react. So,

---------------

 weaker bases are better nucleophiles in protic solvents.

So, in water, S- (ethanethiolate) is a weaker base than OH-, so it's a better nucleophile in

---------------

 aqueous solution.

So, putting 5 (ethanethiolate) above 2 (hydroxide) in nucleophilicity.

Now

---------------

, what about the other nucleophiles.

Number 3 is propionate. Propionate is the conjugate base of propionic acid. Prop

---------------

ionic acid is a weak acid, so its conjugate base (propionate) is a weaker base. So in aqueous solution, prop

---------------

ionate is less basic, so it's less stabilized by solvation, making it a better nucleophile than hydroxide?



---------------

Wait, no. Wait, no: propionate is a weaker base than hydroxide. So in aqueous solution, because

---------------

 it's a weaker base, it's less solvated and thus more available to attack. So propionate would be a better nucleophile than hydroxide.



---------------

Wait, but wait: propionate is a larger anion. So, it's less nucleophilic than, say, eth

---------------

anethiolate because of its negative charge being delocalized over more atoms. Propionate has a negative charge on the oxygen, but it

---------------

's resonance-stabilized. So, its nucleophilicity would be lower compared to something with a single, strong negative charge,

---------------

 like OH- or S-.

Wait, but in terms of basicity, propionate is weaker than hydroxide. So in aque

---------------

ous solution, propionate is a better nucleophile than hydroxide?

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's think

---------------

 about this again. In aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity is often: weaker bases are better nucleophiles. So,

---------------

 for example, I- is a better nucleophile than F- because F- is a stronger base and more solvated.

So

---------------

, propionate (3) is a weaker base than hydroxide (2), so in aqueous solution, propionate is

---------------

 a better nucleophile than hydroxide.

Wait, but wait: propionate is the conjugate base of propionic acid (CH2CH2COOH),

---------------

 which has a pKa around 4.88. So, propionate's conjugate acid is stronger than water (pKa ~15.7), so

---------------

 propionate is a weaker base than hydroxide.

So, in water, propionate (3) is a weaker base than OH- (2), so

---------------

 it's less solvated, making it a better nucleophile. So, propionate is more nucleophilic than hydroxide in

---------------

 aqueous solution.

Wait, but I thought that in a protic solvent, the order of nucleophilicity is weaker base,

---------------

 better nucleophile. So, propionate is weaker base than hydroxide, so propionate is a better nucleophile.



---------------

But wait, I'm not sure about that because propionate is an acetate-like ion, which is a weaker base than

---------------

, say, CH3O- but compared to OH-?

Wait, wait, let me compare their conjugate acids.

---------------

 The pKa of propionic acid is about 4.88. The pKa of water is 15.7. So, propionic acid is a stronger acid than water, meaning

---------------

 that propionate is a weaker base than OH-.

So, propionate is a weaker base than OH-, so in aqueous solution, it's a better nucleophile.

---------------

 So, propionate would be more reactive than hydroxide.

But wait, another factor is the structure. Propionate has a negative

---------------

 charge on the oxygen, but it's resonance-stabilized. So, the actual nucleophilic site is the oxygen, but because

---------------

 the charge is delocalized, it's less available. So, propionate is less nucleophilic than, say, OH

---------------

- because the charge is spread out, but in aqueous solution, because it's a weaker base, it's more reactive as

---------------

 a nucleophile than stronger bases.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to list the nucleophiles in order.



---------------

So, the five nucleophiles are:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (a

---------------

 substituted alkoxide)
2. OH- (hydroxide)
3. Propionate (CH2CH2COO-)
4. Methanol (CH3OH)


---------------

5. Ethanethiolate (CH3CH2S-)

I need to arrange them from most reactive to least reactive in

---------------

 aqueous solution.

So, first, the strongest nucleophiles in aqueous solution would be the weakest bases, as they are less solvated.

So

---------------

, among the given options, the weakest bases would be:

Methanol is a neutral molecule, so it's the weakest base here

---------------

. So, it's a poor nucleophile.

Wait, but wait, the other nucleophiles are all deprotonated (

---------------

they are either anions or from a weak acid). Methanol is a neutral molecule, so it's a weak nucleophile.



---------------

So, the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution would have the anions first, with the weakest bases being better

---------------

 nucleophiles.

So, the anions are 1, 2, 3, 5.

Let me think

---------------

 about their basicity.

Basicity order (strongest to weakest):

5. Ethanethiolate (S-) is a weaker base than OH- because

---------------

 H2S is a stronger acid than H2O. So, 5 is weaker than 2.

2. OH- is stronger base than propionate (3)

---------------

 because propionic acid is stronger acid than water. So, 3 is weaker than 2.

1. 4-methylcyclohexanolate:

---------------

 the basicity depends on the stability of the conjugate acid. The more stable the conjugate acid, the weaker the base. If

---------------

 the cyclohexanol is a weaker acid than water, then 1 is a stronger base than 2.

Wait, wait

---------------

, what's the pKa of cyclohexanol? I remember that alcohols like ethanol have pKa around 19. Cyclohexanol is similar

---------------

, perhaps a bit more acidic because of the ring's stability. Wait, no, I think cyclohexanol is less acidic than water. Wait

---------------

, no, wait: Water has a pKa of ~15.7. Ethanol has a pKa around 19. So

---------------

, cyclohexanol's pKa is about 20 or so. So, the conjugate acid of 4-methylcyclohexanolate is cyc

---------------

lohexanol, which is a weaker acid than water. So, 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH-.

So

---------------

, basicity order: 1 > 2 > 3 > 5?

Wait, no, because 5 is S

---------------

- which is weaker base than OH-.

Wait, wait. Let's think again. The conjugate acid of 5 is H2S, which is a

---------------

 stronger acid than H2O. So, 5 is a weaker base than OH- (2).

Conjugate acid p

---------------

Ka:

- 4-methylcyclohexanol: maybe around 20, so 1 is a strong base.



---------------

- Water: pKa ~15.7, so OH- is a strong base.

- Ethanethiol (HS-): H2S pKa ~7, so S- is a weaker base.

- Propionic acid: pKa ~4.88, so propionate is weaker base than OH-.

So, the

---------------

 basicity order is: 1 (strongest base) > 2 > 3 > 5 (weakest base).

Wait

---------------

, but 5 is weaker than 3? Because propionic acid's pKa is 4.88, which

---------------

 is lower than H2S's pKa of ~7? Wait, no, H2S is stronger acid than propionic acid.

---------------

 So, propionate (3) is weaker base than S- (5).

Wait, no: The strength of the conjugate acid determines

---------------

 the strength of the base. A stronger conjugate acid means the base is weaker.

H2S has a pKa of ~7, while

---------------

 propionic acid is ~4.88. So, propionic acid is stronger than H2S. So, propionate (3

---------------

) is a weaker base than S- (5). Because if the acid is stronger, the conjugate base is weaker.

Wait, that

---------------

's correct. So, the order of basicity is:

1 (4-methylcyclohexanolate) > 2 (OH-) > 5 (ethanethiolate) > 3 (propionate).



---------------

Wait, wait, no. Wait, let me clarify.

Conjugate acid strengths:

- 4-methylcyclohexanol: weaker

---------------

 acid (pKa ~20), so its conjugate base (1) is a stronger base.

- Water: pKa 15.7, so OH- is a strong base.

- Ethanethiol: H2S pKa ~7, so S- is a weaker base than OH-.

- Propionic acid: pKa ~4.88, so propionate (3) is weaker base than S-.

So, the

---------------

 basicity order from strongest to weakest is: 1 > 2 > 5 > 3.

So, in terms

---------------

 of basicity: 1 is the strongest base, then 2, then 5, then 3.

Now, in aqueous solution, the

---------------

 weaker the base, the better the nucleophile. Because stronger bases are more solvated, making them less reactive.

So, the

---------------

 order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution should be the reverse of basicity: 3 < 5 < 2 < 1?

---------------

 No, wait, no. Because nucleophilicity in aqueous solution is inversely related to basicity.

Wait, no

---------------

: the weaker the base, the better the nucleophile in protic solvents.

So, the order from strongest to weakest nucleophile would

---------------

 be: 3 (weakest base) < 5 < 2 < 1? No, that can't be right

---------------

.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think: the weakest base is the best nucleophile in a protic solvent.

So, in

---------------

 order of nucleophilicity (from best to worst):

3 (propionate, weakest base) < 5 (ethanethiolate, next weakest) < 2 (hydroxide, stronger base) < 1 (4-methylcyclohexanolate, strongest base).



---------------

Wait, but that can't be right because, in reality, S- is a better nucleophile than O- in protic solvents.



---------------

Wait, let me correct this. Wait, the order in a protic solvent is based on how well the nucleophile is solvated. Strong

---------------

er bases are more stabilized by solvation, making them less reactive.

So, the correct order would be: the weakest base is the best nucleophile.

So, the

---------------

 order from best to worst nucleophile in aqueous solution would be:

5 (ethanethiolate, weaker base than OH- and

---------------

 1) > 3 (propionate, weakest base?) Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm getting confused

---------------

.

Wait, the basicity order is 1 > 2 >5>3.

So, the weakest base is 3,

---------------

 then 5, then 2, then 1.

So, nucleophilicity order (best to worst) is 

---------------

3 >5>2>1.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because I know that S- is a better nucleophile in aqueous solution than OH-.

Wait

---------------

, perhaps I made a mistake in the basicity order. Let me double-check.

Conjugate acid of 3 is propionic acid, pKa ~4.88.

Conjugate acid of 5 is H2S, pKa ~7.

So, propionic acid is stronger than H2S,

---------------

 so propionate is weaker base than S-.

So, the basicity order is 1 > 2 >5>3.

So

---------------

, the weakest base is 3, then 5, then 2, then 1.

So, in aqueous solution, the

---------------

 nucleophilicity order would be 3 (weakest base) >5>2>1.

But wait, that would

---------------

 mean propionate is a better nucleophile than ethanethiolate, which can't be right. Because I remember that in

---------------

 aqueous solution, thiols are better nucleophiles than carboxylate ions.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something here

---------------

. The structure of the nucleophile also matters. For example, propionate has a negative charge on the oxygen, but it's resonance-stabilized, making it less nucleophilic.



---------------

In contrast, ethanethiolate has a single negative charge on sulfur, which is larger and more polarizable, making it a better nucleophile.



---------------

So, despite propionate being a weaker base than ethanethiolate, its structure (resonance) makes it a worse nucleophile.



---------------

Hmm, so maybe the order isn't just based on basicity but also on the structure.

So, perhaps the order of

---------------

 nucleophilicity in aqueous solution is:

5 (ethanethiolate) > 2 (OH-) > 1 (cyclohexanolate) > 3 (propionate) >4 (methanol).

Wait, but

---------------

 why would 1 be more nucleophilic than 2? Because 1 is a stronger base, but in aqueous solution, stronger bases are worse nucleophiles.

Wait

---------------

, that can't be right. So, 2 is a stronger base than 3 and 5, but weaker than 1.

So

---------------

, in aqueous solution, 5 is a better nucleophile than 2, because 5 is a weaker base.



---------------

Wait, but 1 is a stronger base than 2, so in aqueous solution, 2 is a better nucleophile than 1.



---------------

Wait, no, that can't be. Because 1 is stronger base than 2, so 1 is more stabilized by solvation, making it less nucleophilic than 2.

Wait, no

---------------

, I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

In aqueous solution, the strength of the base is inversely related to nucleophilicity. So, stronger

---------------

 bases are worse nucleophiles.

So, the order of nucleophilicity is:

Weakest base first, strongest base last.

So

---------------

, the order is 3 (weakest base) >5>2>1 (strongest base).

But I'm

---------------

 not confident because I think S- is a better nucleophile than OH- in aqueous solution.

So, in aqueous solution, the

---------------

 order should be:

5 (ethanethiolate) > 3 (propionate) >2 (hydroxide) >1 (4-methylcyclohexanolate) >4 (methanol).

Wait, but prop

---------------

ionate is a weaker base than ethanethiolate. So, according to the basicity, 3 is weaker than 5, so 

---------------

3 is a better nucleophile than 5? No, wait, in protic solvents, weaker bases are better nucleophiles.

So, 

---------------

3 is a weaker base than 5, so 3 is a better nucleophile than 5.

But wait, earlier

---------------

 I thought that in reality, S- is a better nucleophile than O- in aqueous solution. So, which is correct?

Let

---------------

 me think of some examples. For example, in SN2 reactions in water, which is a protic solvent, thiolate ions are better nucleophiles than hydroxide ions

---------------

. So, 5 (ethanethiolate) is a better nucleophile than 2 (hydroxide).

So

---------------

, according to that, 5 should be more nucleophilic than 2.

But according to the basicity, 5 is a weaker base than 2,

---------------

 so it should be a better nucleophile in protic solvent.

So, the order would be 5 >2 >1

---------------

 (no, because 1 is stronger base than 2, so 1 is worse nucleophile than 2).

Wait, no

---------------

. Because 1 is stronger base than 2, so 1 is more stabilized by solvation, making it a worse nucleophile than 2.

So, putting

---------------

 this together:

Nucleophilicity order (best to worst):

5 (ethanethiolate) > 2 (hydroxide) > 

---------------

3 (propionate) >1 (4-methylcyclohexanolate) >4 (methanol).

Wait, but

---------------

 why is propionate above 1? Because propionate is a weaker base than 1, so it's a better nucleophile.



---------------

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me correct the order.

Nucleophilicity order:

Weakest base is

---------------

 best nucleophile.

So, 3 (weakest) >5>2>1>4.

Wait, but I

---------------

 thought 5 is a weaker base than 2. So, 5 is a weaker base than 2, so it's a better nucleophile than 2.

But

---------------

 according to the basicity, 2 is a stronger base than 5, which makes 5 a weaker base and a

---------------

 better nucleophile.

Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Let me make a table:

Nucleophile | Conjugate Acid pKa | Basicity (strong to weak) | Nucleophilicity (prot

---------------

ic solvent)
--- | --- | --- | ---
1. 4-methylcyclohexanolate | ~20 | Strong | Worse nucleophile
2. OH- | ~15.7 | Strong | Worse
3. Propionate | ~4.88 | Weak | Better
5. Ethanethiolate | ~7 | Weak | Better
4. Methanol | ~19.2 | Very weak (neutral) | Worst

---------------



Wait, but wait, the conjugate acid of methanol is CH3OH, which has a pKa of ~19.2. So, it

---------------

's a weaker acid than water, so methanol is a weaker base than OH-.

But methanol is neutral, so it

---------------

's a poor nucleophile in aqueous solution.

So, arranging the nucleophilicity from best to worst:

The weakest bases are

---------------

 the best nucleophiles in protic solvents.

So, weakest base is propionate (3), then ethanethiolate (5), then hydroxide (2), then 4-methylcyclohexanolate (1), and the

---------------

 worst is methanol (4).

Wait, but that would make the order: 3 >5>2>1>4.

But wait

---------------

, I thought that S- is a better nucleophile than O- in aqueous solution. So, 5 should be better

---------------

 than 2.

But according to the table, 5 is a weaker base than 2, so in protic solvent, 5 is a better nucleophile than 2.

So, the

---------------

 order should be: 5 >2>1>3>4.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because

---------------

 propionate is a weaker base than 5.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try a different approach.

In

---------------

 aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity for common nucleophiles is generally:

I- > Br- > Cl- > F- (because

---------------

 F- is a stronger base and more solvated)
S- > O- (like OH- and RO-)



---------------

So, S- is a better nucleophile than OH- in aqueous solution.

Now, comparing with propionate and others

---------------

.

Propionate is a conjugate base of propionic acid, which is a stronger acid than water. So, propionate is a weaker base than OH-. But

---------------

 its structure (resonance) makes it less nucleophilic than S-.

So, in aqueous solution, nucleophilicity order:



---------------

5 (ethanethiolate) > 2 (hydroxide) > 1 (4-methylcyclohexanolate) >3 (propionate) >4 (methanol).

Wait, but

---------------

 why is 1 more nucleophilic than 3? Because 1 is a stronger base than 3. But in protic solvents, stronger bases are worse nucleophiles.

So

---------------

, 3 is a weaker base than 1, so 3 should be a better nucleophile than 1. So

---------------

, the order would be 5 > 2 >3 >1 >4.

Wait, that makes sense because 3 is weaker base than 2, so

---------------

 it's a better nucleophile.

Wait, but 1 is a stronger base than 2, so 1 is worse nucleophile than 2. So, the

---------------

 order would be 5 >2 >3 >1 >4.

Hmm, but why is 3 (propionate) a

---------------

 better nucleophile than 1 (cyclohexanolate)?

Because 3 is a weaker base than 1, so in aqueous solution, 3 is a better nucleophile than 1.

So, putting

---------------

 it all together, the order from best to worst nucleophilicity is:

5 (ethanethiolate) > 2 (hydroxide) >3 (propionate) >1 (4-methylcyclohexanolate) >4 (methanol).

But wait, wait

---------------

. Let me think about the actual structures.

Propionate (CH2CH2COO-) is a larger ion, with

---------------

 a negative charge on O. The negative charge is delocalized, so the nucleophilicity is less than a species with a single, localized charge.



---------------

Ethanethiolate (CH2CH2S-) has a single negative charge on S, which is larger and more polarizable, making it a better nucleophile than

---------------

 propionate.

So, 5 is better than 3.

Hydroxide (2) is an O- with

---------------

 a single negative charge. It's more nucleophilic than propionate but less than ethanethiolate.

So, 

---------------

5 >2>3>1>4.

But wait, 1 is 4-methylcyclohexanolate. It

---------------

's a bulky alkoxide. So, in terms of nucleophilicity, steric hindrance might make it less reactive.

---------------

 But in aqueous solution, it's a stronger base than 2, which makes it worse nucleophile than 2.

So, the

---------------

 order should be 5 >2>3>1>4.

Wait, but wait, another factor: the leaving group ability.

---------------

 Wait, no, that's for substitution reactions. Here, we're just arranging the nucleophiles.

Alternatively, another way

---------------

 to approach this is by considering the stability of the conjugate acid and the solvent.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

---------------

 Let me think of each nucleophile's nucleophilicity in aqueous solution.

1. 4-methylcyclohexanolate: Strong

---------------

 base, so in aqueous solution, it's a poor nucleophile because it's heavily solvated.

2. Hydroxide: Strong base, but less

---------------

 than 1. So, it's less solvated than 1, making it a better nucleophile than 1.

3. Propionate: Weaker base than 2 and 5. So, it

---------------

's a better nucleophile than 2 and 5? No, because 5 is a weaker base than 2,

---------------

 so 5 is a better nucleophile than 2.

Wait, but propionate is a weaker base than 5,

---------------

 so it's a better nucleophile than 5?

No, that doesn't make sense. Because 5 is weaker base than 2, which

---------------

 is weaker than 1.

Wait, I'm getting myself into a loop. Let me try to list the order from most

---------------

 to least reactive.

Most reactive: 5 (ethanethiolate) >2 (hydroxide) >3 (propionate) >1 (cyclohexanolate) >4 (methanol).

But

---------------

 earlier I thought that 3 is a weaker base than 5, so 3 is a better nucleophile than 5,

---------------

 which contradicts.

Wait, no. Because 3 is a weaker base than 5, so in aqueous solution, 3 should be a better nucleophile than 5. But

---------------

 I thought that S- is a better nucleophile than O- in aqueous solution.

I think I'm missing something here

---------------

. Let me think about this: in aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity for some common ions is:

HS

---------------

- > S^2- > I- > Br- > Cl- > F- > OH- > RO- >

---------------

 RCOO-.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that in aqueous solution, the order is:

---------------

 I- > Br- > Cl- > F- for halides, and S- > O- (like OH- and RO-).

So, in

---------------

 that case, 5 (ethanethiolate) would be more nucleophilic than 2 (hydroxide), which is more nucleophilic than 3 (propionate),

---------------

 which is more than 1 (cyclohexanolate), and methanol is the least.

So, the order would be 5 >2>3>1>4.

But

---------------

 wait, propionate is a conjugate base of a stronger acid than ethanethiolate. So, propionate is weaker base than ethanethiolate,

---------------

 so propionate is better nucleophile than ethanethiolate? No, that can't be right because S- is a

---------------

 better nucleophile.

Wait, no. Wait, the conjugate acid of ethanethiolate is H2S (pKa ~7), and propionic acid is ~4.88. So, propionate is a weaker base than ethanethiolate.

---------------

 So, in aqueous solution, propionate is a better nucleophile than ethanethiolate.

Wait, but I

---------------

 thought that S- is a better nucleophile than O- in aqueous solution. So, this is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps I

---------------

'm making a mistake in comparing the basicity. Let me get the basicity right.

Conjugate Acid pKa:



---------------

- Ethanethiolate (S-): H2S pKa ~7.

- Propionate (3): propionic acid pKa ~4.88.

So

---------------

, since propionic acid is a stronger acid (lower pKa), propionate is a weaker base than S-.

So

---------------

, basicity order: 5 (ethanethiolate) >3 (propionate).

Wait, no. Because

---------------

 if the conjugate acid is stronger (lower pKa), the conjugate base is weaker. So, propionate is a weaker base than S-.

So, basic

---------------

ity order: 5 >3? No, that's not right. Because the conjugate acid of 5 (H2S) has a higher pKa than the conjugate acid of 3 (propionic acid).

---------------

 So, H2S is weaker acid than propionic acid, meaning that S- is a stronger base than propionate.

Wait, wait

---------------

, that can't be. Wait, if H2S has a pKa of ~7, and propionic acid has

---------------

 pKa ~4.88, then H2S is a weaker acid than propionic acid. So, S- is a stronger base than propionate.

So, basic

---------------

ity order: 5 (S-) >3 (propionate).

So, in aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity is

---------------

:

Weakest base first.

3 (weaker than 5) >5 (weaker than 1 and 2) >

---------------

 others.

Wait, no, that can't be right because 5 is a stronger base than 3.

Wait, this

---------------

 is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Another approach: in aqueous solution, the nucleophilicity order

---------------

 is:

ethanethiolate (5) > hydroxide (2) > propionate (3) >4-methylcyclohexanolate (1) > methanol (4).

Because

---------------

:

- Ethanethiolate is a weaker base than hydroxide (since H2S is weaker acid than H2O),

---------------

 so in aqueous solution, 5 is a better nucleophile than 2.

Wait, no, wait. H2S is a weaker acid than H2O,

---------------

 which means S- is a stronger base than OH-.

So, in aqueous solution, stronger bases are worse nucleophiles. So, OH

---------------

- is a stronger base than S-? No, wait, H2S is weaker acid than H2O, so S- is stronger base than OH-.

Wait, no

---------------

, if H2S is weaker acid (higher pKa), then S- is a stronger base.

Wait, no,

---------------

 I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify:

If acid HA has a lower pKa, it's a stronger acid. Its conjugate base A- is a weaker base.

So, H

---------------

2S (pKa ~7) is weaker acid than H2O (pKa ~15.7). So

---------------

, H2O is a stronger acid than H2S.

Wait, no, wait: no, H2O has a higher pKa,

---------------

 so it's a weaker acid. H2S has a lower pKa, so it's a stronger acid. So, the

---------------

 conjugate base of H2S (S^2-) is a weaker base than OH-.

Wait, no, wait

---------------

: the conjugate base of H2S is HS- (HS^-). Wait, no: H2S is a diprotic acid. The

---------------

 first dissociation is H2S ↔ H+ + HS^-, pKa ~7. The second dissociation is HS^- ↔ H+ + S^2-, pKa ~13.

So

---------------

, HS^- is the conjugate base of H2S, and S^2- is the conjugate base of HS^-.

So

---------------

, the conjugate base of H2S is HS^-, which has a pKa of ~7. So, HS

---------------

^- is a weaker base than OH- (since H2O has pKa ~15.7).

Wait, no

---------------

, because the conjugate acid of HS^- is H2S, pKa ~7. The conjugate acid of OH- is H2O, pKa ~15.7. So, since

---------------

 H2S is a stronger acid (lower pKa) than H2O, HS^- is a weaker base than OH-.

So, the

---------------

 basicity order: OH- > HS^-.

So, in aqueous solution, OH- is a stronger base than HS^-.

So

---------------

, in aqueous solution, HS^- is a better nucleophile than OH-.

Wait, but in the options, 

---------------

5 is ethanethiolate, which is CH2CH2S^-.

So, HS^- is the conjugate base of H2S, which

---------------

 is a weaker base than OH^-.

So, in aqueous solution, HS^- is a better nucleophile than OH^-.

So

---------------

, the order of nucleophilicity is 5 (HS^-) >2 (OH^-).

Now, comparing to prop

---------------

ionate (3), which is a conjugate base of propionic acid (pKa ~4.88). So, propionate is a weaker base than HS^- because

---------------

 propionic acid is stronger acid (lower pKa) than H2S.

So, propionate is a weaker base than HS^-, so

---------------

 in aqueous solution, propionate is a better nucleophile than HS^-.

Wait, no, because if propionate is a weaker base, it's a better nucleophile.



---------------

So, the order would be:

3 (propionate) >5 (HS^-) >2 (OH^-) >1 (4-methylcyclohexanolate) >4 (methanol).

But I

---------------

'm not sure about this because I thought S- is better than O-.

Alternatively, perhaps propionate is less nucleophilic than eth

---------------

anethiolate because of its structure.

Wait, propionate has a negative charge on the oxygen, which is resonance-stabilized, making it less nucleophilic compared to eth

---------------

anethiolate, which has a single negative charge on S.

So, perhaps the order is 5 >3 >2>1>4.

But

---------------

 I'm not confident.

Another approach: think about the solvent and the ability to shed solvent molecules.

In aqueous solution, the

---------------

 nucleophile must break away from solvent molecules. The larger and more polarizable the nucleophile, the easier it is to shed the solvent.



---------------

So, ethanethiolate (5) is larger and more polarizable than OH- (2), so it's a better nucleophile.

Between

---------------

 2 and 3: OH- is smaller, more tightly solvated than propionate? Or is it the other way around.

Prop

---------------

ionate is a larger ion, so it might be less tightly solvated, making it a better nucleophile than OH-.

Wait, but I

---------------

'm not sure. Let me think: propionate is CH2CH2COO^-, which is a larger anion.

---------------

 Its charge is delocalized, so it's less solvated than OH^-.

So, in aqueous solution, propionate might

---------------

 be a better nucleophile than OH^-.

So, the order would be 5 >3>2>1>4.

But earlier

---------------

 I thought that in aqueous solution, S- is better than O-.

So, perhaps the correct order is 5 >2>3>1>4.

But

---------------

 I'm not confident. I think I'm getting stuck because I'm trying to recall conflicting information.

Alternatively, I can look

---------------

 at the options provided and see which one fits.

The options are:

A) 5, 2, 3, 1 and 4

B) 2, 5, 1, 4 and 3

C) 2, 5, 3, 4 and 3

D) 5, 2, 1, 3 and 4

Wait, option

---------------

 A is 5, 2, 3, 1,4.

Which would be 5>2>3>1>4.

But

---------------

 earlier I thought that 3 might be better than 2.

Alternatively, option D is 5,2,1,3,4.

Which

---------------

 would be 5>2>1>3>4.

But that would suggest that 1 is better than 3, which I

---------------

'm not sure about.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is 5>2>3>1>4.

Which would

---------------

 correspond to option A.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is 5>3>2>1>4.

But

---------------

 that's not an option.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 5, 2, 3,1,4.



---------------

Option D:5,2,1,3,4.

Hmm. I think the correct order is 5>2>3>1>4.

Which

---------------

 matches option A.

But wait, earlier I thought that 3 is a weaker base than 5, so 3 is a better nucleophile. So, in

---------------

 that case, 5 should be less reactive than 3.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because 5 is a stronger base than 3,

---------------

 so in aqueous solution, 5 is a worse nucleophile than 3.

Wait, no, I'm getting this

---------------

 wrong again.

Wait, if 5 is a stronger base than 3, then in aqueous solution, 5 is more solvated and thus

---------------

 a worse nucleophile than 3.

So, the correct order should be 3>5>2>1>4.

But that

---------------

's not one of the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A:5,2,3,1,4.

Option B:2,5,1,4,3.

Option C:2,5,3,4,3.



---------------

Option D:5,2,1,3,4.

Hmm, none of these match 3>5>2>1>4.

So

---------------

, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the order is 5>2>1>3>4.

Which would be option D.

But why

---------------

 would 1 be more nucleophilic than 3?

Because 1 is a stronger base than 3, so in aqueous solution, 1 is a worse nucleophile than 3.

So

---------------

, the order should have 3 after 5 and 2.

But I'm not getting any of the options to match.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the order is 5>2>3>1>4.

Which is option A.

In that case, 

---------------

5 is first, then 2, then 3, then 1, then 4.

But why would 3 be better

---------------

 than 1? Because 3 is a weaker base, so it's a better nucleophile.

So, putting it all together, I

---------------

 think the correct order is 5>2>3>1>4, which is option A.


To determine the nucleophilicity order of the given nucleophiles in aqueous solution, we analyze their basicity, solvation effects, and structural properties

---------------

. In aqueous solution (a polar protic solvent), nucleophilicity trends are influenced by solvation: weaker bases are better nucleophiles because they are less solvated and more available to react. Additionally, polar

---------------

izable and less sterically hindered nucleophiles are more reactive.

### Nucleophiles:
1. **4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate**: A strong base due to its alkoxide structure, but st

---------------

eric hindrance from the methyl group reduces its nucleophilicity slightly.
2. **Hydroxide (OH⁻)**: A strong base, but in aqueous solution, it is heavily solvated, making it less nucleophilic than weaker bases.
3. **Propionate (CH₃CH₂COO⁻)**: A weaker base than hydroxide and ethanethiolate due to resonance stabilization of the negative charge on oxygen, which reduces its nucleophilicity.
4. **Methanol (CH₃OH)**: A neutral molecule, making it the poorest nucleophile in this set.
5. **Ethanethiolate (CH₃CH₂S⁻)**: A weaker base than hydroxide because

---------------

 H₂S is a stronger acid than H₂O. The sulfur atom is larger, more polarizable, and less solvated, making it a better nucleophile than hydroxide in aqueous solution.

### Analysis:
- **Ethanethiolate (5)**: Being

---------------

 a weaker base and more polarizable, it is the most nucleophilic in aqueous solution.
- **Hydroxide (2)**: A strong base but heavily solvated, making it the second most nucleophilic.
- **Propionate (3)**: A weaker base than hydroxide and ethanethiolate, but its resonance-stabilized charge makes it less nucleophilic than ethanethiolate.
- **4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1)**: A strong base but steric hindrance and strong

---------------

 solvation reduce its nucleophilicity compared to hydroxide.
- **Methanol (4)**: A neutral molecule, making it the poorest nucleophile.

### Final Order:
The nucleophilicity order in aqueous solution is **5 > 2 > 3 > 1 > 4**, corresponding to **Option A**.
