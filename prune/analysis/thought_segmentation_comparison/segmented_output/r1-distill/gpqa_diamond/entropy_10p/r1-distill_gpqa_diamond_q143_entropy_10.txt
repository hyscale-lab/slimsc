Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. They've given me the production energy, mass, and width. Let

---------------

 me jot down the values:

E_X = 8 GeV
m_X = 1.2 GeV
Γ_X = 320 MeV

Wait, I

---------------

 remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. The formula I think is τ = ħ / Γ, but I'm not entirely

---------------

 sure. Oh right, Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the particle's lifetime. And since the mean lifetime τ is ħ divided by Γ, that makes sense.

But wait, how

---------------

 do I get the decay distance? Oh right, the decay distance (L) would be the velocity (v) multiplied by the lifetime (τ). So L = v * τ.

Hmm

---------------

, so I need to find v first. The velocity can be found using the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The total

---------------

 energy E is related to the momentum p and mass m by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². But

---------------

 wait, here E is given in GeV, and mass is also in GeV/c² maybe? Let me get the units straight.

Wait, E

---------------

 is given as 8 GeV. The mass is 1.2 GeV, which I think is GeV/c². So E

---------------

² = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. Let me rearrange that to find p.

So

---------------

, (pc)^2 = E² - (m c^2)^2. Let's plug in the numbers.

E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So,



---------------

(pc)^2 = (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 (GeV)^2.

So pc = sqrt(62.56) GeV. Let's calculate that. Hmm

---------------

, sqrt(62.56) is about 7.91 GeV. So p = 7.91 GeV / c.

Now, to find the velocity v, I can use the relativistic formula:



---------------

E = γ m c², where γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But another approach is to use the relation between momentum and velocity. The

---------------

 relativistic momentum is p = γ m v. So, p = γ m v.

But wait, I have E and

---------------

 p, so maybe I can find β (v/c) and γ.

Alternatively, β = (pc)/(E). Because

---------------

 p c is 7.91 GeV, E is 8 GeV, so β = 7.91 / 8 ≈ 0.98875.

So v = β c ≈ 0.98875 * c. That

---------------

's a significant fraction of the speed of light.

Now, let's calculate the lifetime τ. τ = ħ / Γ. Wait

---------------

, Γ is given in MeV, so I need to make sure the units are consistent. ħ has units of GeV·s when

---------------

 we use GeV for energy.

Wait, let me think about the units. The Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So

---------------

, Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait

---------------

, that seems really small. But particles with short lifetimes decay quickly, so that makes sense.

Now, the decay length L is v * τ. Let

---------------

's compute that.

v is 0.98875c. c is about 3e8 m/s. So v ≈ 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Wait

---------------

, no: 0.98875 * 3e8 = 0.98875 * 3 =

---------------

 2.96625, so 2.96625e8 m/s.

Now, τ is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = v * τ = 2.96625e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiplying those together:

2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (

---------------

2.96625 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.

Let

---------------

 me calculate 2.96625 * 2.056875. Hmm, 3 * 2 is 6, but more accurately:

2.96625 ≈ 2.966,

---------------

 2.056875 ≈ 2.057.

2.966 * 2.057 ≈ let's compute:



---------------

2 * 2.057 = 4.114

0.966 * 2.057 ≈ approx

---------------

 2.000 (since 0.966 *2=1.932, and 0.966*0.057≈0.055, total about

---------------

 1.987)

So total is around 4.114 + 1.987 ≈ 6.101.

Wait, maybe

---------------

 better to do exact multiplication:

2.96625 * 2.056875.

Let

---------------

 me compute:

2.96625 * 2 = 5.9325

2.96625 * 0.056875 ≈



---------------

Well, 0.056875 is about 56875e-6.

So 2.96625 * 0.05 = 0.1483125

2.96625 * 0.006875 = 

---------------

0.02031328125

Adding those: 0.1483125 + 0.02031328125 = 0.16862578125.

So total is 5.9325 + 0.16862578125 ≈ 6.10112578125.

So approximately

---------------

 6.101e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see:

Option C is 5.0223e-15 m,

---------------

 option A is 5.02e-16, D is 4.06e-16, B is 4.06e-15.

Wait, but

---------------

 wait, did I miscalculate? Because 6e-16 isn't one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation steps

---------------

. Let me double-check.

Wait, I think I made a mistake with the calculation of the velocity. Let me re-c

---------------

alculate β.

β = (p c) / E = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) = 0.98875. That seems correct.

So

---------------

 v = 0.98875c = approx 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s = 2.966e8 m/s. Correct.

Tau

---------------

 calculation: ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is 0.32 GeV.

Tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 s. That's correct.

So

---------------

 L = v * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let

---------------

 me compute that exactly.

2.966e8 = 2.966 * 1e8 =

---------------

 2.966 * 10^8

2.056875e-24 = 2.056875 * 10^-24

Multiply them

---------------

:

(2.966 * 2.056875) * 10^(8-24) = (approx

---------------

 6.101) * 10^-16 m.

So about 6.101e-16 meters. But looking at the options, none

---------------

 of them match that. So maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe the formula for decay length is wrong. Let

---------------

 me think again.

Wait, another approach: the mean path is (c * tau) * beta.

So c tau is (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) = 6.170625e-16 m.

Then multiply by beta (0.98875): 6.170625e-16 * 0.98875 ≈ 6.106

---------------

e-16 m.

Again, same result.

But the options don't have this value. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I messed

---------------

 up the calculation of p. Let me recheck that step.

E_X = 8 GeV, m_X = 1.2 GeV.

E² = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

So, (pc)^2 = (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56.



---------------

So pc = sqrt(62.56) = 7.91 GeV.

Wait, wait, wait

---------------

. Wait a minute, wait a minute. I think I messed up the units here. Because E is given in GeV, and m is in GeV/c².

---------------

 Because E is energy, and m is mass, which is in GeV/c². So when I compute (m c²), that

---------------

 would be (1.2 GeV/c²) * c² = 1.2 GeV. So units are

---------------

 correct.

So, (pc)^2 = (E)^2 - (m c^2)^2, yes. So correct

---------------

.

So pc = 7.91 GeV. So p = 7.91 GeV / c.

Wait

---------------

, but when calculating beta, which is (pc)/E, that's (7.91 GeV)/8 GeV = 0.98875. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 I made a mistake in the calculation of ħ. Let me double-check the value of ħ.

Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Yes

---------------

, that's correct.

So, tau = ħ / Γ. Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approx

---------------

 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately. Let me compute 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32.

6.582 / 0.32 = (

---------------

6.582 * 1000)/(320) = (6582)/(320) = approx

---------------

 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s

---------------

? No, wait, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25.

6.582 / 0.32 = 

---------------

20.56875. So tau is 20.56875e-25 s?

---------------

 Wait no, 6.582e-25 is 6.582 * 1e-25. Dividing by 0.32,

---------------

 which is 3.2e-1, so (6.582 / 3.2 ) * 1e-24.

6.582 / 3.2 is approx 2.056875. So 2.056875e-24 s. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 I made a mistake in the calculation of L.

Wait, let me recompute L = v * tau.

v = beta c = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s = 2.96625e8 m/s.

tau = 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 2.96625e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Calcul

---------------

ating 2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.96625 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.

2

---------------

.96625 * 2.056875: Let me compute this accurately.

2.056875 * 2.96625.

Let

---------------

 me break it down:

2.056875 * 2 = 4.11375

2.056875 * 0.96625 = let's compute 

---------------

0.9 * 2.056875 = 1.8511875,

---------------

 0.06625 * 2.056875 = approx 0.1361

---------------

03515625.

Adding 1.8511875 + 0.136103515625 = 1.987291015625.

So total is 4.11375 + 1.987291 ≈ 6.0990

---------------

41.

So 6.099041e-16 m.

Hmm, that's about 6.1e-16 m. But none of the options match this.

Wait, looking

---------------

 at the options again:

Option A: 5.0223e-16 m

Option D: 4.0655e-16 m.

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 I made a mistake in the calculation of beta.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate beta more precisely. Let me compute beta again

---------------

.

p c = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4) / c^2? Wait, perhaps I'm

---------------

 getting confused.

Wait, no. The correct formula is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So (

---------------

pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2.

So, (pc) = sqrt(8^2 - 1.2^2) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV.

So beta = (pc)/(E) = 7.91 /8 = 0.98875.

Wait

---------------

, that's correct. So v = 0.98875c.

Wait, maybe I should compute beta

---------------

 more accurately. Let me compute 7.91 /8 exactly.

7.91 divided by 8 equals 0.98875 exactly. So no

---------------

 mistake there.

Hmm, perhaps I should check the calculation of L again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of 

---------------

2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Wait, 2.96625e8 is 2.96625 * 1e8.



---------------

2.056875e-24 is 2.056875 * 1e-24.

Multiply them

---------------

: (2.96625 * 2.056875) * (1e8 * 1e-24) = (6

---------------

.101) * 1e-16.

Which is 6.101e-16 m.

But the

---------------

 options don't have this. So I must have made a mistake somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the

---------------

 fact that the decay width is given as Γ, and the mean lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, is

---------------

 the decay width the same as the total decay rate? I think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the natural

---------------

 line width formula, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the decay width is given in MeV, and I should

---------------

 convert it properly.

Wait, Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So that

---------------

 part was correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the product.

Wait, 2.96625e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = (2.96625 * 2.056875) * 1e-16 m.

Wait

---------------

, 2.96625 * 2.056875: let me compute it again

---------------

.

2.056875 * 2 = 4.11375.

2.056875 * 0.96625:

---------------

 let me compute that as (2.056875 * 0.9) + (2.056875 * 0.06625).

2.056875 * 0.9 = 1.8511875.

2.056875 * 0.06625 = 

---------------

0.136103515625.

Adding them gives 1.8511875 + 0.136103515625 = 1.987291015625.

So total is 4.11375 + 1.987291015625 = 6.099041015625.

So 

---------------

6.099e-16 m. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different approach, such as using the mean

---------------

 lifetime based on the uncertainty principle.

Wait, but that's what I did. Another thought: perhaps the decay width is related

---------------

 to the lifetime as τ = ħ/(Γ/2), but I don't think that's correct. Because the width

---------------

 Γ is equal to ħ/τ, so τ = ħ/Γ.

Wait, perhaps the width is given in natural

---------------

 units, so I have to convert it correctly.

Wait, ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So that

---------------

's correct.

Wait, perhaps the calculation for the momentum was wrong because I used GeV and GeV/c².

Wait, let

---------------

 me think again. E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c².

So, E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 )

So, (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2.

But

---------------

 E is in GeV, m c² is GeV. So yes, (pc) would be in GeV as well.

So p

---------------

 = (sqrt(E² - m²)) / c.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (pc) as sqrt(E² - m²), which

---------------

 is correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A)5.0223e-16 m

B)4.0655e-15 m

C)5.0223e-15 m

D)4.0655e-16 m

Wait

---------------

, my calculated value is about 6.1e-16 m, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the

---------------

 calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the mean path in a different way. Let me think about the relation

---------------

 between decay width and lifetime.

Wait, another approach: the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ.

So τ = ħ / Γ.

So

---------------

, tau = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.

Then

---------------

, the mean decay distance is c * tau * beta.

Wait, that's another way to compute it. So, L = beta c tau.

So

---------------

, beta is 0.98875, c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So, beta c tau = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let

---------------

 me compute this:

3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by 0.98875: 6.170625e-16 * 0.98875 ≈ 6.106

---------------

e-16 m.

Again, same result.

Hmm, perhaps the given options have a typo, but that's unlikely. So

---------------

 maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of beta.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should have used the relativistic relation

---------------

 involving gamma.

Wait, another approach: gamma = E/(m c^2). So gamma is 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Then

---------------

, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1/(44.444...))) = sqrt( (43.4444

---------------

)/44.4444 ) ≈ sqrt(0.97777) ≈ 0.9888.

Wait, that's consistent with beta

---------------

 being 0.98875. So that's correct.

Hmm. Maybe the problem expects me to use the speed

---------------

 of light as 3e8 m/s, but perhaps I should use a more precise value, like 2.99792e8 m/s. Let's try that.

v = 0.98875 * 2.99792e8 m/s ≈ 0.98875 * 2.99792e8 ≈ 

---------------

2.965e8 m/s.

So tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 2.965e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (

---------------

2.965 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.

2.965 * 2.056875 �

---------------

� let's compute:

2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375

0.965 * 2.056875 ≈ 2.0 (approx).

---------------

 Let's compute:

0.965 * 2 = 1.93

0.965 * 0.056875 ≈ 0.055.



---------------

Total ≈ 1.93 + 0.055 = 1.985.

So total is 4.11375 + 1.985 ≈ 6.09875.

So L

---------------

 ≈ 6.09875e-16 m, which is about 6.1e-16 m.

Still

---------------

, not matching any options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of p. Let me compute

---------------

 (pc) again.

E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV.

(pc)^2 = 8^2 - 1.2^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56.

So pc = sqrt(62.56) = 7.91 GeV. So p = 7.91 GeV / c.

But

---------------

 wait, perhaps I should compute beta as (p c)/(E) = 7.91 /8 = 0.98875. Correct.

Wait, another

---------------

 thought: perhaps the decay width is given as the total width, but I should use the natural line width formula, which might

---------------

 involve the width in a different way. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for decay length is L = (c * tau) * (gamma

---------------

 v), but I don't think that's right.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma and then use it to find beta

---------------

. Gamma is E/(m c^2) = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1/44.444...)) = sqrt(43.444/44.444) = sqrt(0.97777) ≈ 0.9888.

Same

---------------

 as before.

Wait, perhaps the error is elsewhere. Let me check the calculation of the product 2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Wait, 2.96625e8 is 2.96625 * 1e8 =

---------------

 296,625,000.

2.056875e-24 is 2.056875 * 1e-24 = 0.000000000000000000000002056875.

Multiply them: 296,625,000 * 0.000000000000000000000002056875.

Wait

---------------

, 296,625,000 = 2.96625e8.

2

---------------

.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.96625 * 2.056875) * 1e8 * 1e-24 = (6.101) * 1e-16.

So

---------------

 6.101e-16 m.

Hmm. I'm stuck. None of the options match. Perhaps

---------------

 I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the decay length formula is L = (c * tau) * beta.



---------------

Wait, that's what I did. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the speed of light as 3e8 m/s exactly

---------------

, and compute more accurately.

v = 0.98875 * 3e8 = 2.96625e8 m/s.

Tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Compute

---------------

 2.96625 * 2.056875:

Let me compute 2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375.

0.96625 * 2.056875 = let's compute 

---------------

0.9 * 2.056875 = 1.8511875.

0.06625 * 2.056875 = 0.136103515625.

Adding 

---------------

1.8511875 + 0.136103515625 = 1.987291015625.

So total is 4.11375 + 1.987291015625 = 6.099041015625.

So 6.099e-16 m.

But

---------------

 the options don't have that. So perhaps I should look for a calculation error elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the question uses a

---------------

 different value for ħ. Let me check what the exact value is.

The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 197.327 MeV·fm. Wait

---------------

, that's another unit system. Hmm, perhaps I should compute using different units.

Wait, another approach: perhaps use natural units where c=1, and then convert to

---------------

 meters.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the decay length using the formula L = (E *

---------------

 tau) / m.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because E = gamma m c², and L = beta gamma c tau.

Wait, gamma

---------------

 is E/(m c²) = 8/(1.2) = 6.6667.

So, L = beta gamma c tau.

Beta

---------------

 is 0.98875, gamma is 6.6667.

So, L = 0.98875 * 6.6667 * c * tau.

Wait, c * tau is (3e8 m/s) * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.

So, 0.98875 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.591

---------------

6.

So L = 6.5916 * 6.170625e-16 ≈ 4.065e-15 m.

Wait, that's approximately

---------------

 4.065e-15 m. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option D is 4.0655e-16 m.

Wait, wait

---------------

, did I make a mistake here? Because earlier calculations didn't give this.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Beta

---------------

 is 0.98875, gamma is 8/(1.2) = 6.6666666667.

So beta * gamma = 0.98875 * 6.6666666667 ≈ 6.5916666667.

c

---------------

 * tau is 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.

So L = 6.5916666667 * 6.170625e-16 = let's compute this

---------------

.

6.5916666667 * 6.170625 = ?

Let

---------------

 me compute 6 * 6.170625 = 37.02375.

0.5916666667 * 6.170625 ≈ let

---------------

's compute:

0.5 * 6.170625 = 3.0853125.

0.0916666667 * 6.170625 ≈ approx 0.5655

---------------

.

So total ≈ 3.0853125 + 0.5655 ≈ 3.6508.

So total 6.5916666667 *6.170625 ≈ 37.02375 +3.6508 ≈ 40.67455.

Wait, that

---------------

 can't be right because 6.5916666667 *6.170625 is

---------------

 about 40.67455.

So 40.67455e-16 m = 4.067455e-15 m.

Which

---------------

 is approximately 4.067e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. Close

---------------

 enough, considering rounding.

So perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but earlier calculations didn't account for this approach. Hmm

---------------

, why the discrepancy?

Because earlier I computed L as v * tau, which gave me around 6.1e-16 m, but this

---------------

 approach gives 4.06e-15 m.

Wait, I think I see the mistake. I think I confused

---------------

 the formula for L. Let me think again.

The mean decay length is L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Which

---------------

 is L = gamma beta c tau.

Gamma is 8/(1.2) ≈6.6667.

Beta is 0.98875.

So gamma beta = 6.6667 * 0.98875 ≈6.5916666667.

c tau is 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.

So L = 6.5916666667 *6.170625e-16 ≈40.67e-16 m =4.067e-15 m.

Ah, so

---------------

 that's option B:4.0655e-15 m.

So I think I made a mistake in my initial approach by not considering gamma. Wait

---------------

, no, wait: in the initial approach, I used L = beta c tau, which is the same as beta gamma c tau *

---------------

 (1/gamma), because gamma is E/(m c^2).

Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing the formulas

---------------

.

Wait, the correct formula for decay length is L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Because gamma is the Lorentz factor, and beta is v/c. So L

---------------

 = gamma * beta * c * tau.

But tau is the proper lifetime, so the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau.

Wait, no, wait

---------------

: the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. Because the particle's lifetime is longer due to time dilation.

So tau_lab = gamma tau_proper.

And

---------------

 the decay length is L = v tau_lab = beta c gamma tau_proper.

Which is the same as gamma beta c tau_proper.

But

---------------

 tau_proper is the proper lifetime, which is hbar / Gamma.

So, tau_proper = hbar / Gamma.

So

---------------

, putting it all together:

L = gamma beta c (hbar / Gamma).

Alternatively, L = (gamma beta c hbar) / Gamma.

Hmm

---------------

, so perhaps I should compute it using this formula.

Gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.

Beta =0.98875.

c =3e8 m/s.

hbar =6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma (

---------------

the decay width) is 0.32 GeV.

So, L = (6.6667 *0.98875 *3e8 m/s *6.582e-25 GeV·s ) / (0.32 GeV).

Let me compute numerator

---------------

 and denominator.

Numerator: 6.6667 *0.98875 ≈6.5916666667.

6.5916666667 *3e8 ≈1.9775e9.

1.9775e9 *6.582e-25 ≈1.9775 *6.582 *1e-16.

1.9775 *6.582 ≈ approx

---------------

 13.05.

So numerator ≈13.05e-16 GeV·m.

Denominator: 0.32 GeV.

So L = (13.05e-16 GeV·m) / (0.32 GeV) )= 40.78e-16 m =4.078e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.078e-15 m. Close

---------------

 to option B's 4.0655e-15 m.

Hmm, perhaps the exact calculation would give

---------------

 a slightly different number.

Wait, let me compute 6.6666666667 *0.98875 =

---------------

 ?

6.6666666667 *0.98875.

Let me compute:

6 * 0.98875 =5.9325.

0.6666666667 *0.98875 ≈0.6591666667.

Total:

---------------

5.9325 +0.6591666667=6.5916666667.

So

---------------

, 6.5916666667.

Multiply by 3e8:6.5916666667 *3e8=1.9775e9.

Multiply by hbar (6.582e-25 GeV·s):1.9775e9 *6.582e-25 = ?



---------------

1.9775 *6.582 = let's compute.

1.9775 *6=11.865.

1.9775 *0.582= approx 1.9775 *0.5=0.98875; 1.9775 *0.082≈0.162.

---------------

 Total ≈1.15075.

So total 11.865 +1.15075=13.01575.

So 13.01575e-16 GeV·m.

Divide by 0.32 GeV:

13.01575e-16 / 0.32=40.67421875e-16 m=4.067421875e-15 m.

So L≈4.067e-15 m.

Which is very close to option B:4.0655e-15 m.

So, the correct answer is option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for the decay length:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the mean lifetime, with \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The energy \( E \) and mass \( m \) are given as \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). Using the relativistic energy relation:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
The momentum \( p \) is determined from the relativistic energy-momentum relation:

\[
E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 \implies (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2
\]

Substituting \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \):

\[
(pc)^2 = 8^2 - 1.2^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 \implies pc = \sqrt{62.56} \approx 7.91 \, \text{GeV}
\]

The velocity fraction \( \beta \) is then:

\[
\beta = \frac{pc}{E} = \frac{7.91}{8} \approx 0.98875
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau \)
The mean lifetime \( \tau \) is given by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s}}{0.32 \, \text{GeV}} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( L \)
The decay length is:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \), \( \beta = 0.98875 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 6.6667 \cdot 0.98875 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24})
\]

First, calculate \( \gamma \beta \):

\[
\gamma \beta = 6.6667 \cdot 0.98875 \approx 6.5916666667
\]

Then, calculate \( c \tau \):

\[
c \tau = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) \approx 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
\]

Finally, calculate \( L \):

\[
L = 6.5916666667 \cdot 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The calculated decay length \( L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B: \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.
