Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure it out. Hmm

---------------

, the question is about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. The setup is a bit specific, so I'll need to break

---------------

 it down.

Alright, so the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. The

---------------

 positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured

---------------

—one upper-right, the other lower-right. We need to find the angle between them.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma is the factor by which time and length dilate in special relativity. But

---------------

 for this problem, I think it's more about the energies and momenta of the particles before the collision. Because when they annihilate, energy and momentum are conserved, so the photons' energies and directions must match

---------------

 that.

So, first, I should find the rest masses and their relativistic energies. The rest mass of an electron and positron is the same: m_e =

---------------

 9.109e-31 kg, but wait, actually, for calculations, sometimes it's easier to work in units where c=1 and use

---------------

 energies in terms of rest mass energy. But I'm not sure yet.

Wait, the problem states that both photons have the same energy. So each

---------------

 photon has energy E_photon = same value. Since the total energy from the annihilation must equal the sum of the electron and positron's energies.

But

---------------

 let's get into the initial setup. The electron and positron are moving towards each other on the same axis. So the

---------------

 electron is moving to the right (from left), and the positron is moving to the left (from right). So their velocities are opposite in direction.

I

---------------

 need to compute their relativistic momenta and energies before collision.

The Lorentz factor gamma is given for each. So for the electron, gamma_e = 4. For the positron, gamma_p = 2.

Wait

---------------

, but wait a second: the positron has the same mass as the electron, right? So their rest masses are the same. So m

---------------

_e for both.

So the total energy before collision is the sum of their relativistic energies. The relativistic energy E is gamma * m_e c². So

---------------

 E_e = 4 m_e c², E_p = 2 m_e c². So total energy is 6 m_e c².

But

---------------

 when they annihilate, the energy goes into two photons, each with energy E_photon. Since E_photon1 = E_photon2 = E_photon, each

---------------

 has E_photon = 3 m_e c². Because 2 E_photon = 6 m_e c².

Wait, but

---------------

 wait, photons carry momentum as well. The momentum of a photon is E/c, but since they're massless, p = E/c. But

---------------

 the direction of the momentum is the direction the photon is moving.

So the problem says one photon is moving upper-right, another lower-right. So their momenta are in different directions, but both in

---------------

 the right direction in the x-component. Wait, but the initial system has some momentum.

Wait, let's think about the total momentum before collision. Since

---------------

 the electron and positron are moving towards each other, their momenta are opposite in direction.

The electron's momentum is gamma_e * m_e v_e, but wait

---------------

, velocity is a vector. So for the electron, moving to the right, its momentum is positive. The positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative.

But let

---------------

's compute each's momentum in terms of gamma and mass.

The momentum p = gamma * m_e * v. But v

---------------

 can be expressed in terms of gamma. Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

Alternatively, another

---------------

 way: p = gamma m_e v = gamma m_e (c) sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) =

---------------

 m_e c sqrt( gamma² (1 - 1/gamma²) ) = m_e c sqrt( gamma² - 1 )

Wait, let

---------------

 me compute that again. Let me think about it.

Wait, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So 

---------------

1 - v²/c² = 1/(gamma²), so v = c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

So p = gamma m_e v = gamma m_e c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) = m_e c sqrt( gamma² (1 - 1/gamma²) ) = m_e c sqrt( gamma² - 1 )

Yes

---------------

, that's right.

So for the electron, gamma_e =4, so p_e = m_e c sqrt(4² -1 ) = m_e c sqrt(15) ≈ m_e c * 3.87298.

But

---------------

 wait, the positron is moving in the opposite direction, so its momentum is negative. Its gamma_p is 2, so p_p = - m_e c sqrt(2² - 1) = - m_e c sqrt(3) ≈ - m_e c * 1.73205.

So the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e + p_p = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait

---------------

, wait, but the positron's momentum is in the opposite direction, so the electron's is positive, the positron's is negative. So p

---------------

_initial = p_e - |p_p|?

Wait, no. Let me think again: the electron is moving to the right, so its momentum is positive. The positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative. So when

---------------

 adding, the total momentum is p_e (positive) + p_p (negative).

So p_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait

---------------

, sqrt(15) is about 3.872, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 

---------------

3.872 - 1.732 ≈ 2.140 m_e c.

So the total initial momentum is approximately

---------------

 2.14 m_e c in the positive x-direction.

Now, after the collision, the photons must carry away momentum such that the total momentum equals the initial. Also

---------------

, the photons' energies are equal, so each has energy E_photon = 3 m_e c².

Each photon's momentum is p_photon = E_photon / c = (3 m_e c²) / c = 3 m_e c.

But wait

---------------

, the photon's momentum is a vector. So the first photon is moving upper-right, the second lower-right. So both have x-components in

---------------

 the positive direction and y-components either positive or negative.

Let me denote the angles. Let's say photon 1 makes an angle theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 makes an angle -theta below the x-axis. But

---------------

 wait, the problem states one is upper-right and the other lower-right, but not necessarily symmetric. Hmm, but the problem

---------------

 says that their energies are the same, which would imply their momenta magnitudes are the same. So their p vectors have the same magnitude but different directions.

So,

---------------

 since each photon has the same energy, and the same |p|, which is 3 m_e c.

So the

---------------

 momentum vectors are p1 = (3 m_e c) * (cos(theta), sin(theta)) and p2 = (3 m_e c) * (cos(phi), sin(phi)), where theta is positive (upper) and phi is negative (lower). Or maybe

---------------

 theta is the angle from the x-axis for one, and phi is the same magnitude but in the opposite direction. Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 they are symmetric about the x-axis.

Wait, but in the problem, one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So both

---------------

 have positive x-components, but one has positive y, the other negative.

So, the sum of their momenta must equal the initial total momentum.

---------------

 Let's write the equations.

Total momentum after collision is p1 + p2 = (3 m_e c (cos(theta) + cos(phi)), 3 m_e c (sin(theta) + sin(phi))).

This must equal the initial momentum, which is (m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)), 0).

So,

---------------

 the x-component: 3 m_e c (cos(theta) + cos(phi)) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Divide both sides by m_e c:

3 (cos(theta) + cos(phi)) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.87298 - 1.73205 ≈ 2.14093.

Wait

---------------

, but wait: sqrt(15) is approximately 3.872, sqrt(3) is about 1.732. So sqrt(15)-sqrt(3) ≈ 2.140.

So,

---------------

 3 (cos(theta) + cos(phi)) ≈ 2.140.

Divide both sides by 3: cos(theta) + cos(phi) ≈ 0.7133.

But

---------------

 wait, if the photons are symmetric about the x-axis, then phi = -theta. So let's test that possibility.

If phi = -theta, then cos(phi) = cos(theta), and sin(phi) = -sin(theta).

So,

---------------

 cos(theta) + cos(phi) = 2 cos(theta).

So equation becomes 2 cos(theta) ≈ 0.7133 → cos(theta) ≈ 0.35666 →

---------------

 theta ≈ arccos(0.35666) ≈ 69 degrees.

Wait, but

---------------

 wait, if theta is about 69 degrees, then the angle between the photons would be theta + |phi| = 69 +69=138 degrees? Because each

---------------

 is at +/- theta from the x-axis. So the angle between them would be 2 theta, which would be approximately 138 degrees. That

---------------

's one of the options, option C.

But wait, let's check the y-component. The sum of the y-components of the photons' momenta must be zero because the initial total momentum in the y-direction is zero.

So the

---------------

 y-component equation is:

3 m_e c (sin(theta) + sin(phi)) = 0.

Again, if phi = -theta, then sin(phi) = -sin(theta), so sin(theta) + sin(phi) = 0, which satisfies the equation.

So that

---------------

's consistent. So the assumption that the photons are symmetric about the x-axis seems valid.

So theta is arccos(0.35666). Let me calculate that more

---------------

 accurately.

Compute arccos(0.35666):

cos(60°) is 0.5, cos(70°) is about 0.3420. So 0.3566 is between 69 and 70 degrees.

Wait

---------------

, let me compute it. Let's think in terms of calculator steps. Let me use a calculator.

Wait, 0.35666 is

---------------

 the value.

Using a calculator: arccos(0.35666) is approximately 69 degrees.

So 

---------------

69 degrees each from the x-axis, one above, one below.

So the angle between the two photons is 69 +69=138 degrees, which is option C.

So

---------------

 the answer is C) 138.


To solve the problem, we analyze the collision of an electron and a positron, which annihilate into two photons. The electron moves to the right with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron moves to the left with a Lorentz factor of 2. The photons produced have equal energies and move in directions symmetric about the x-axis, one upper-right and the other lower-right. The goal is to determine the angle between the directions of the photons.

### Step 1: Relativistic Energy and Momentum
The total energy before the collision is the sum of the relativistic energies of the electron and positron:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.
\]
After the collision, this energy is converted into the energy of two photons, each with energy:
\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{2} = 3 m_e c^2.
\]

The momentum of each photon is:
\[
p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = \frac{3 m_e c^2}{c} = 3 m_e c.
\]

### Step 2: Conservation of Momentum
The total momentum before the collision is the sum of the momenta of the electron and positron. Using the relativistic momentum formula \( p = \gamma m_e v \) and the relationship \( v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \), the momenta are:
\[
p_e = \gamma_e m_e c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_e^2}} = 4 m_e c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{16}} = 4 m_e c \sqrt{\frac{15}{16}} = m_e c \sqrt{15},
\]
\[
p_p = \gamma_p m_e c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_p^2}} = 2 m_e c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4}} = 2 m_e c \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = m_e c \sqrt{3}.
\]
Since the positron moves to the left, its momentum is negative:
\[
p_{\text{initial}} = p_e - p_p = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
\]

After the collision, the photons carry the total momentum. Let the angles of the photons above and below the x-axis be \(\theta\). The momentum components of the photons are:
\[
p_1 = 3 m_e c (\cos\theta, \sin\theta), \quad p_2 = 3 m_e c (\cos\theta, -\sin\theta).
\]
The total momentum after the collision is:
\[
p_{\text{total}} = p_1 + p_2 = (6 m_e c \cos\theta, 0).
\]
Equating the total momentum before and after the collision:
\[
6 m_e c \cos\theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
\]
Dividing through by \( m_e c \):
\[
6 \cos\theta = \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}.
\]
Approximating \(\sqrt{15} \approx 3.872\) and \(\sqrt{3} \approx 1.732\):
\[
6 \cos\theta \approx 3.872 - 1.732 = 2.140,
\]
\[
\cos\theta \approx \frac{2.140}{6} \approx 0.3567.
\]
Thus:
\[
\theta \approx \arccos(0.3567) \approx 69^\circ.
\]

### Step 3: Angle Between the Photons
The two photons are symmetric about the x-axis, one at \(+\theta\) and the other at \(-\theta\). The angle between them is:
\[
\text{Angle} = \theta + \theta = 2\theta \approx 2 \times 69^\circ = 138^\circ.
\]

### Final Answer:
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
