Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me. Let's try to break it down. Hmm, binary star systems,

---------------

 eclipses, and radial velocities. I remember that binary systems orbit around a common center of mass, and their orbits can be studied through eclipses and radial velocity curves.

The question gives two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. The periods between

---------------

 primary eclipses are given, so that's the orbital period for each system.

Then there's the radial velocity (RV) data. For system_1, the RV variations have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, it's 15 km/s and 10 km/s. I

---------------

 think the RV amplitudes are related to the masses of the stars. The more massive a star is, the smaller its velocity because it orbits slower

---------------

 around the center of mass. So the mass is inversely proportional to the velocity amplitude.

Wait, right. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula K = (v) where v is the velocity, and it

---------------

's related to the mass of the companion. The formula I remember is K1 = (M2 / (M1 + M2)) * (2πG / P)^(1/3) )^(1/3

---------------

) ) or something like that. Alternatively, the ratio of the velocities is inversely proportional to the masses. So K1/K2 = M2/(M1)

---------------

 or something like that. Wait, let me think. The more massive star would have a smaller velocity because it's orbiting a

---------------

 smaller circle. So if in a system, star A has mass M_A and star B has mass M_B, their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So velocity

---------------

_A / velocity_B = M_B / M_A.

So in system_1, the two stars have velocities 10 and 5 km/s. So the

---------------

 ratio is 10:5, which simplifies to 2:1. That would mean that M1 (the

---------------

 more massive star) is twice as massive as M2. Because velocity is inversely proportional to mass. So M1/M2 = 2.

---------------

 So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = 2M2 + M2 = 3M2.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the

---------------

 velocities are the RV semi-amplitudes. So in system_1, the two stars have velocities K1=10 and K2=5. So

---------------

 their mass ratio is M2/M1 = K1/K2 = 10/5 = 2. So M2 is twice as massive as M1. Wait

---------------

, no, wait. Let me get this right. The mass ratio is (M2/M1) = (K1/K2), because M

---------------

 is inversely proportional to K. So if K1 is larger, M2 is larger. So M2 = 2 * M1. So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1.

Similarly, in system_2, the RV amplitudes are 15 and 10. So K1=15, K2=10. The mass ratio is (M2/M1) = K1/K2 = 15/10 = 3/2. So M2 = (3/2) M1. So

---------------

 the total mass of system_2 is M1 + M2 = M1 + (3/2 M1) = (5/2) M1. Wait, but I

---------------

'm not sure if M1 here refers to the same star as in system_1. Hmm, perhaps I should clarify.



---------------

Wait, in each system, the two stars are orbiting each other. So for system_1, let me denote the masses as M_A and M_B. Similarly

---------------

, for system_2, the masses are M_C and M_D.

In system_1, the RV amplitudes are K1=10 and K2=5. So the

---------------

 ratio K1/K2 = 10/5 = 2. The mass ratio M_B/M_A = K1/K2 = 2. So M_B = 2 M_A. So total mass of system_1 is M_A + M_B = M_A + 2 M_A = 3 M_A.

In system_2, the RV amplitudes are K1=15 and K2=10. Ratio K1/K2 = 15/10 = 3/2. So mass ratio M_D/M_C = K1/K2 = 3/2. So M_D = (3/2) M_C. So total mass of system_2 is M_C + M_D = M_C + (3/2) M_C = (5/2) M_C.

Wait, but how

---------------

 does this relate to the orbital period? Oh, right, the period comes into play because the velocity depends on the period as well. So

---------------

 the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is K = ( (2πG) / (P (1 - e²)^(3/2)) )^(1/3) ) * (M_com

---------------

panion sin i) / ( (M_total)^(2/3) )

But since both systems have their own periods, and

---------------

 their own eccentricities (but the problem doesn't mention eccentricity, so perhaps we can assume e=0, circular orbits?),

---------------

 then the formula simplifies.

Wait, but the problem states that the periods are 2 years and 1 year. So system

---------------

_1 has P=2 years, system_2 P=1 year.

But since the question is about the mass ratio between the two systems, perhaps the periods will

---------------

 affect the mass calculation.

Wait, but the problem is about the sum of the masses. So perhaps I need to compute the mass of each system based

---------------

 on the RV data and the period.

Wait, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_companion) ) / ( (M1 + M2) )^(1/3) ) * ( (

---------------

2π) / P ) )^(1/3) ) * sin i / (c) ?

Wait, perhaps more

---------------

 accurately, the formula for K is:

K = ( (2πG) / (P c^2) )^(1/3) * ( (M_companion) sin i ) / ( (M_total)^(2/3) ) )

But since

---------------

 the problem doesn't give any inclination angles (i), and I think we can assume that sin i is the same for both systems,

---------------

 or perhaps that the inclination is such that sin i is 1 (eclipsing systems). So for eclipsing binaries, sin i is approximately

---------------

 1 because the orbit is edge-on, leading to eclipses.

So, for each system, K is proportional to (M_companion) / (M_total)^(2/3) ) * (P)^(−1/3)



---------------

Wait, let's think about each system separately.

In system_1:
- K1 = 10 km/s (for star A)
- K2 = 5 km/s (for star B)
- P1 = 2 years.

In system_2:
- K1' =15 km/s (star C)
- K2' =10 km/s (star D)
- P2=1 year.

But

---------------

 wait, each star's RV amplitude depends on the mass of the other star and the total mass.

Let me write the formula for each star's K.

For system_1, for star A:


---------------

K_A = ( (2πG) / (P1 c^2) )^(1/3) * (M_B sin i) / ( (M_A + M_B)^(2/3) )

Similarly, for star B:
K_B = ( (2πG) / (P1 c^2) )^(1/3) * (M_A sin i) / ( (M_A + M_B)^(2/3) )

So

---------------

 the ratio K_A / K_B = M_B / M_A.

Which is what I thought earlier. So K_A/K

---------------

_B = M_B/M_A.

In system_1: K_A =10, K_B=5 → ratio 2.

---------------

 So M_B = 2 M_A.

Similarly, system_2: K_C =15, K_D=10 → ratio 15/10 =3/2. So M_D = (3/2) M_C.

So the

---------------

 total masses are:

System_1: M1 = M_A + M_B = M_A + 2 M_A =3 M_A.

System_2: M2 = M_C + M_D = M_C + (3/2) M_C = (5/2) M_C.

Now, the

---------------

 question is, by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?

So we need to find M1 / M2.

But we

---------------

 need to find M1 and M2 in terms that can be related. To do that, we need to involve the period.

---------------

 Because the periods are different, and the RV depends on the period as well.

Wait, but the RV semi-amplitude K

---------------

 also depends on the period and the masses. So perhaps I can set up equations for K in each system.

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 I can use the fact that the product of the two Ks in each system relates to the total mass and the period.

Wait, for

---------------

 each system, the product K_A * K_B would be proportional to (M_B * M_A) / ( (M_A + M_B)^{4/3} ) ) * (2

---------------

πG/(P c^2))^{2/3} )

But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I

---------------

 can find the mass function for each system.

Wait, the mass function for a spectroscopic binary is f(M) = (M_companion^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M_total)^2 (M_total + M_companion) ) )

Hmm, but

---------------

 that might not directly help here. Maybe I should think in terms of the masses and the orbital period.

Another approach: the

---------------

 velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * P) / (2π) )^(1/3) * (M_companion sin i) / ( (M_total)^(2/3) )

But

---------------

 since sin i is 1 (eclipsing systems), we can ignore it.

So for each system, K is

---------------

 proportional to (M_companion) / ( (M_total)^(2/3) ) * P^(−1/3)

Wait

---------------

, so for system_1, K_A =10 = (G P1)^(1/3) * (M_B) / ( (M1)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(2π))^(1/3) )

Similarly, K_B=5 = (G P1)^(1/3) * (M_A) / ( (M1)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(2π))^(1/3) )

So

---------------

, K_A / K_B = (M_B / M_A) → which we already have as 2, so M_B=2 M_A. So

---------------

 M1 =3 M_A.

Similarly, in system_2, K_C=15, K_D=10. So K_C/K_D =15/10=3/2 =

---------------

 M_D/M_C → M_D= (3/2) M_C. So M2= M_C + M_D= (5/2) M_C.

Now, the

---------------

 question is, how to relate the masses of the two systems. So, we need to find M1/M2.

But we

---------------

 need to involve the periods. Because the RV depends on the period.

Wait, perhaps we can express the mass of each system in terms of the RV

---------------

 amplitudes and the period.

Let me think about the formula for K. Let's write it as:

K = ( (2πG) / (P c^2) )^(1/3) * (M_companion sin i) / ( (M_total)^(2/3) )

Ass

---------------

uming sin i =1,

K = ( (2πG) / (P c^2) )^(1/3) * (M_companion) / ( (M_total)^(2/3) )

We

---------------

 can write this as:

K^3 = (2πG) / (P c^2) * (M_companion^3) / (M_total^2)

Multiply

---------------

 both sides by (P c^2) / (2πG):

K^3 * (P c^2) / (2πG) ) = M_companion^3 / M_total^2

But

---------------

 M_total = M_companion + M_primary.

Wait, perhaps for each system, we can write this for each star.

For

---------------

 system_1, star A's K is 10 km/s, and it's orbiting M_B.

So,



---------------

(10)^3 * (2 c^2 * P1) / (2πG) ) = M_B^3 / (M1)^2

Similarly, for star B in

---------------

 system_1:

(5)^3 * (2 c^2 * P1) / (2πG) ) = M_A^3 / (M1)^2

So

---------------

 let me write these two equations.

Equation 1: 1000 * (2 c^2 * 2) / (2πG) ) = M_B^3 / ( (3 M_A)^2 )

Wait, wait

---------------

, M1 =3 M_A, so M_B = 2 M_A.

So M1 =3 M_A.



---------------

So equation 1:

10^3 * (2 c^2 * 2) / (2πG) ) = ( (2 M_A)^3 ) / ( (3 M_A)^2 )

S

---------------

implify:

1000 * (4 c^2) / (2πG) ) = (8 M_A^3) / (9 M_A^2 )

Simplify denominator

---------------

 on right: 9 M_A^2.

So right side is 8 M_A /9.

Left side: (4000 c^2) / (2π G )

So equation

---------------

 becomes:

(4000 c^2) / (2π G) ) = (8 M_A) /9

Multiply both sides by 2π G:

4000 c^2 = (8 M_A /9) * 2 π G

S

---------------

implify right side: (16 π G M_A) / 9.

So,

4000 c^2 = (16 π G M_A ) /9

S

---------------

olve for M_A:

M_A = (4000 c^2 * 9 ) / (16 π G )

Similarly

---------------

, for equation 2 in system_1:

(5)^3 * (2 c^2 * 2) / (2 π G ) ) = ( M_A^3 ) / ( (3 M_A )^2 )

Wait

---------------

, wait, equation 2 is for star B, which has K=5.

So:

5^3 * (2 c^2 * 2) / (2 π G ) = M_A^3 / ( (3 M_A)^2 )

Which

---------------

 is:

125 * (4 c^2) / (2 π G ) ) = M_A^3 / (9 M_A^2 )

Simplify right side: M_A /9.

Left side: 500 c^2 / ( π G )

So,

500 c^2 / ( π G ) = M_A /9.

Multiply both sides by π G:

500 c^2 = ( M_A π G ) /9.

So

---------------

,

M_A = (500 c^2 * 9 ) / ( π G )

Wait, but from equation 1, M_A was (4000 *9 c^2 ) / (16 π G ) →

---------------

 (36000 c^2 ) / (16 π G ) → 2250 c^2/( π G )

From equation 2, M_A = (500 *9 c^2 ) / ( π G ) → 4500 c^2/( π G )

Wait, that's a problem. Both

---------------

 equations give different expressions for M_A, which suggests I must have made a mistake.

Ah, perhaps I messed up the equations

---------------

. Let me re-express the K formula correctly.

Wait, let's re-derive the K formula correctly.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (2 π G ) / (P c^2 ) )^(1/3) * ( M_companion sin i ) / ( ( M_total )^(2/3) )

But

---------------

 wait, I think I made a mistake in the formula earlier. Let me get the correct formula.

The correct formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = [ (G (M_companion) ) / ( (M1 + M_companion) ) )^(1/3) ] * ( 2 π / P )^(1/3) * sin i

Ass

---------------

uming sin i=1, and M1 is the primary's mass.

Wait, another approach: the formula can be written as:

K = ( (G

---------------

 P ) / (2 π ) )^(1/3) * ( M_companion ) / ( (M1 + M_companion )^(2/3) )

So

---------------

, K = [ ( G P )/(2 π) ) ]^(1/3) * M_companion / ( (M_total)^(2/3) )

So

---------------

, for system_1, star A has K_A=10 km/s, and it's orbiting M_B.

So,

K_A = [ (G P1 )/(2 π ) ]^(1/3) * ( M_B ) / ( (M1 )^(2/3) )

Similarly, for star B:



---------------

K_B = [ (G P1 )/(2 π ) ]^(1/3) * ( M_A ) / ( (M1 )^(2/3) )

So, the

---------------

 ratio K_A/K_B = M_B / M_A = 2 → M_B=2 M_A.

So, M1 = M_A + M_B =3 M_A.

Now, let

---------------

's write the equation for K_A.

10 = [ (G * 2 )/(2 π ) ]^(1/3) * (2 M_A ) / ( (3 M_A )^(2/3) )

Simplify denominator

---------------

:

(3 M_A )^(2/3) = [3^(2/3)] * [M_A^(2/3) ]

So,

10 = [ (G * 2 )/(2 π ) ]^(1/3) * (2 M_A ) / ( 3^(2/3) * M_A^(2/3) )

Simplify numerator:



---------------

2 M_A = 2 M_A^(1)

Denominator: 3^(2/3) M_A^(2/3)

So,

(

---------------

2 M_A ) / ( 3^(2/3) M_A^(2/3) ) ) = 2 M_A^(1 - 2/3) / 3^(2/3) ) = 2 M_A^(1/3) / 3^(2/3)

So,

10 = [ (G * 2 )/(2 π ) ]^(1/3) * ( 2 M_A^(1/3) ) / 3^(2/3 )

Simplify the constants

---------------

:

[ (2 G )/(2 π ) ] = G/(π )

So,

[ G/(π) ]^(1/3) * (2 M_A^(1/3) ) / 3^(2/3 )

So

---------------

,

10 = [ G/(π) ]^(1/3) * (2 ) / 3^(2/3) ) * M_A^(1/3 )

Let me compute

---------------

 the constants:

[ G/(π) ]^(1/3) is a constant, but I think it's going to cancel out when we

---------------

 take the ratio between the two systems.

Wait, perhaps I can write this as:

10 = [ (G/(2 π)) * 2 ]^(1/3) * ( 2 M_A^(1/3) ) / (3^(2/3) )

Wait, maybe I

---------------

'm complicating this. Let's instead express M_A in terms of K and the other variables.

Let me rearrange the equation:

10 = [ (G * 2 )/(2 π ) ]^(1/3) * (2 M_A ) / ( (3 M_A )^(2/3) )

S

---------------

implify the expression inside:

[ (G * 2 )/(2 π ) ] = G/(π )

So,

10 = [ G/(π) ]^(1/3) * (2 M_A ) / (3^(2/3) M_A^(2/3) )

Which

---------------

 simplifies to:

10 = [ G/(π) ]^(1/3) * ( 2 M_A^(1) ) / ( 3^(2/3) M_A^(2/3) )

=

---------------

 [ G/(π) ]^(1/3) * (2 / 3^(2/3)) ) * M_A^(1 - 2/3 )

= [ G/(π) ]^(1/3) * (2 / 3^(2/3)) ) * M_A^(1/3 )

Let me write

---------------

 this as:

10 = [ (G/(π)) ]^(1/3) * (2/(3^(2/3))) ) * M_A^(1/3 )

Let

---------------

 me isolate M_A^(1/3):

M_A^(1/3) = 10 / [ (G/(π))^(1/3) * (2/(3^(2/3))) ) ]

But

---------------

 I'm not sure if this is helpful. Let me think about system_2.

In system_2, the period P2=1 year. The

---------------

 K values are 15 and 10.

Similarly, K_C=15, K_D=10.

So,

---------------

 K_C/K_D =15/10=3/2 → M_D= (3/2) M_C.

Total mass M2= M_C + M_D= (5/2) M_C.

Now

---------------

, writing the equation for K_C:

15 = [ (G P2 )/(2 π ) ]^(1/3) * ( M_D ) / ( (M2 )^(2/3) )

Sub

---------------

stituting M_D= (3/2) M_C and M2= (5/2) M_C.

So,

15 = [ (G *1 )/(2 π ) ]^(1/3) * ( (3/2) M_C ) / ( (5/2 M_C )^(2/3) )

Simplify denominator:

(5/2 M_C )^(2/3) = (5/2)^(2/3) * (M_C)^(2/3 )

So,

15 = [ G/(2 π) ]^(1/3) * (3/2 M_C ) / ( (5/2)^(2/3) M_C^(2/3) )

Simplify numerator:

(3/2 M_C ) = (3/2) M_C^1.

Denominator: (5/2)^(2/3) M_C^(2/3).

So,

(3/2 M_C ) / ( (5/2)^(2/3) M_C^(2/3) ) = (3/2) / (5/2)^(2/3) ) * M_C^(1 - 2/3 ) = (3/2) / (5/2)^(2/3) ) * M_C^(1/3 )

So,

15 = [ G/(2 π) ]^(1/3) * (3/2) / ( (5/2)^(2/3) ) ) * M_C^(1/3 )

Now

---------------

, let's compare the equations for system_1 and system_2.

For system_1, we had:

10 = [ G/(π) ]^(1/3) * (2/(3^(2/3))) ) * M_A^(1/3 )

For system_2,

15 = [ G/(2 π) ]^(1/3) * (3/2) / ( (5/2)^(2/3) ) ) * M_C^(1/3 )

Let

---------------

 me write both equations:

Equation 1 (sys1):

10 = [ G/(π) ]^(1/3) * (2 / 3^(2/3) ) * M_A^(1/3 )

Equation 2 (sys2):

15 = [ G/(2 π) ]^(1/3) * (3/2) / ( (5/2)^(2/3) ) ) * M_C^(1/3 )

I

---------------

 think the idea is to find M1 and M2 in terms of G, π, etc., and then find M1/M2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take

---------------

 the ratio of the two equations to eliminate G and π.

Let me compute (Equation 1) / (Equation 2):

(10)

---------------

 / (15) = [ [ G/(π) ]^(1/3) * (2 / 3^(2/3) ) * M_A^(1/3 ) ] / [ [ G/(2 π) ]^(1/3) * (3/2) / ( (5/2)^(2/3) ) ) * M_C^(1/3 ) ]

Simplify:

2/3 = [ (G/(π) )^(1/3) / (G/(2 π) )^(1/3) ) ] * [ (2 /3^(2/3) ) / ( (3/2) / (5/2)^(2/3) ) ) ] * [ M_A^(1/3) / M_C^(1/3) ) ]

Simplify the first term: (G/(π)) / (G/(2 π) ) )^(1/3) = [ (G/(π) ) * (2 π/G ) ) ]^(1/3) = (2)^(1/3).

Second term:

(2 /3^(2/3) ) / ( (3/2) / (5/2)^(2/3) ) )

Let me compute numerator

---------------

 and denominator:

Numerator: 2 / 3^(2/3 )

Denominator: (3/2) / (5/2)^(2/3 )

So,



---------------

= [ 2 / 3^(2/3) ] * [ (5/2)^(2/3) ) / (3/2) ) ]

= 2 * (5/2)^(2/3) ) / (3^(2/3) * (3/2) )

= [ 2 * (5^(2/3) / 2^(2/3) ) ) ] / [ 3^(2/3) * 3/2 ]

S

---------------

implify numerator:

2 * 5^(2/3) / 2^(2/3) ) = 2^(1 - 2/3) * 5^(2/3) ) = 2^(1/3) * 5^(2/3)

Denominator:

3^(2/3) * 3/2 = 3^(2/3 +1) / 2 ) = 3^(5/3) /2

So,



---------------

= [2^(1/3) *5^(2/3) ] / [3^(5/3) /2 ]

= [2^(1/3) *5^(2/3) * 2 ] / 3^(5/3 )

= 2^(4/3) *5^(2/3) /3^(5/3 )

=

---------------

 [2^4 *5^2 ]^(1/3) / [3^5 ]^(1/3 )

= (16 *25 )^(1/3) / (243 )^(1/3 )

= (400 )^(1/3) / (243 )^(1/3 )

= (400/243 )^(1/3 )

=

---------------

 ( (400/243) )^(1/3 )

So, the second term simplifies to (400/243)^(1/3 )



---------------

Third term: [ M_A^(1/3) / M_C^(1/3) ) ] = (M_A / M_C )^(1/3 )

Putting it all together:

2/3 = (2^(1/3) ) * (400/243 )^(1/3 ) * (M_A / M_C )^(1/3 )

Let

---------------

 me compute the constants:

2^(1/3) * (400/243 )^(1/3 ) = [ 2 * (400/243) ) ]^(1/3 )

Compute

---------------

 2 * (400/243 ) = 800 /243 ≈ 3.29218.

So, [

---------------

 800 /243 ]^(1/3 ) ≈ (3.29218 )^(1/3 ) ≈ 1.488.

So,

2/3 ≈ 1.488 * (M_A/M_C )^(1/3 )

S

---------------

olve for (M_A/M_C )^(1/3 ):

= (2/3 ) / 1.488 ≈ (0.6667 ) / 1.488 ≈ 0.446.

So,

(M_A/M_C )^(1/3 ) ≈ 0.446 → M_A/M_C ≈ (0.446)^3 ≈ 0.089.

So, M_A ≈ 0.089 M_C.

But I

---------------

'm not sure if I did that correctly. Let me compute the exact fraction.

Wait, 2/3 = [ (2 *400/243 )^(1/3) ) ] * ( M_A / M_C )^(1/3 )

So

---------------

,

( M_A / M_C )^(1/3 ) = (2/3) / ( (800/243 )^(1/3) )

Compute

---------------

 (800/243 )^(1/3 )

800 = 8 * 100 = 8 * 10^2 → 2^3 * (2*5)^2 = 2^5 *5^2.

243=3^5.

So,

800/243 = (2^5 *5^2) / 3^5.

So,

(800/243 )^(1/3 ) = (2^5)

---------------

^(1/3) * (5^2)^(1/3) / (3^5 )^(1/3 )

= 2^(5/3) *5^(2/3) /3^(5/3 )

So

---------------

,

( M_A / M_C )^(1/3 ) = (2/3) / [ 2^(5/3) *5^(2/3) /3^(5/3) ) ]

= (2/3 ) * [ 3^(5/3) ) / ( 2^(5/3) *5^(2/3) ) )

= [ 2 *3^(5/3) ) ] / [ 3 * 2^(5/3) *5^(2/3) ) ]

Simplify:

= [ 2^(1) *3^(5/3) ) ] / [ 3^(1) * 2^(5/3) *5^(2/3) ) ]

= 2^(1 -5/3 ) *3^(5/3 -1 ) /5^(2/3 )

= 2^(-2/3) *3^(2/3 ) /5^(2/3 )

= [ 3^2 / (2^2 *5^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

Because,



---------------

2^(-2/3 ) = (2^2 )^(-1/3 )

3^(2/3 ) = (3^2 )^(1/3 )

5^(2/3 ) = (5^2 )^(1/3 )

So,

[3^2 ] / [2^2 *5^2 ] → (9)/(4*25) )= 9/100.

So,

[ (9/100 ) ]^(1/3 )

So,

( M_A / M_C )^(1/3 ) = (9/100 )^(1/3 )

Thus

---------------

,

M_A / M_C = (9/100 )^(1) → 9/100 → 0.09.

So, M_A =0.09 M_C.

Wait

---------------

, but wait. Let me check that math again.

We have:

( M_A / M_C )^(1/3 ) = [ 3^2 / (2^2 *5^2 ) ]^(1/3 ) = [ 9/(4*25) ]^(1/3 ) = (9/100 )^(1/3 ) ≈ (0.09 )^(1/3 ) ≈ 0.448.

Wait, no

---------------

, wait. Because (9/100 )^(1/3 ) is (0.09 )^(1/3 ) ≈ 0.448.

Wait, but

---------------

 earlier when I tried to compute the constants, I got 0.446, which is close. So perhaps that

---------------

's correct.

So,

( M_A / M_C )^(1/3 ) ≈ 0.448 → M_A / M_C ≈ (0.448)^3 ≈ 0.089.



---------------

So, M_A ≈0.089 M_C.

Now, let's get back to the masses of each system.

System

---------------

_1's total mass M1 =3 M_A.

System_2's total mass M2 = (5/2) M_C.

We need to find M1 / M2 = [3 M_A ] / [ (5/2) M_C ] = (6 M_A )/(5 M_C )

Sub

---------------

stituting M_A ≈0.089 M_C:

M1/M2 = (6 *0.089 M_C ) / (5 M_C ) → (6 *0.089 ) /5 → 0.534 /5 ≈ 0.1068.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the

---------------

 options are around 0.4-1.2, and 0.1068 is way below that. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I messed up the equations. Let me try a different approach.

Alternative approach: The mass function.

The mass function for a binary system is f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2 )^2 (1 + M1/M2 ) ) )

But for

---------------

 circular orbits and edge-on, sin i=1.

But perhaps I can use the fact that f(M) = K^3 P/(2 π G )

Wait

---------------

, the mass function is given by:

f(M) = (K^3 P )/(2 π G )

And f

---------------

(M) = ( M_companion^3 ) / ( (M_total)^2 (1 + M_companion/M_primary )^2 )

But since

---------------

 M_primary >> M_companion is not the case here, so it's better to use the other form.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 I can write the mass of each system in terms of their periods and RV amplitudes.

Another approach: since both stars in a system contribute

---------------

 to the RV, their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses.

In system_1:

M_A / M_B = K_B / K_A =5/10 =1/2 → M_A = (1/2) M_B → M_B=2 M_A.

So M1= M_A + M_B =3 M_A.

In system_2:

M_C / M_D = K_D / K_C =10/15=2/3 → M_C= (2/3) M_D → M_D= (3/2) M_C.

So M2= M_C + M_D= M_C + (3/2 M_C )= (5/2) M_C.

Now, the

---------------

 mass function for each system is f(M) = (K^3 P )/(2 π G )

But since the mass

---------------

 function is the same for both stars in a system, perhaps I can relate the mass functions.

Wait, but the mass function for

---------------

 each star is different. Hmm, perhaps I should compute f(M) for each star and then relate them.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 I can use the fact that the mass function for each star in a system is the same.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach.

The

---------------

 mass of the system is M_total = M1 + M2.

The mass function is f(M) = (M2^3 ) / ( (M1 + M2 )^2 (1 + M1/M2 )^2 ) )

But perhaps

---------------

 I can write the mass function in terms of the RV amplitude.

Wait, for each star, the mass function is:

f(M) = (K^3 P )/(2 π G )

So

---------------

 for system_1, star A has K=10 km/s, P=2 years.

f_A = (10^3 * 2 )/(2 π G ) → 

---------------

2000/(2 π G )

Similarly, for star B, K=5, P=2 → f_B= (5^3 *2 )/(2 π G )= 250/(2 π G )

But wait

---------------

, this can't be right because the mass function for each star should be the same. So I must have made a mistake here.

Ah, wait

---------------

. No, the mass function f(M) is the same for both stars in the same system. So perhaps the formula is

---------------

 f(M) = ( (K1^3 P ) )/(2 π G ) = ( (K2^3 P ) )/(2 π G )

But that would imply K1=K2, which isn't the case. So perhaps

---------------

 I'm applying the formula incorrectly.

Wait, the mass function is a function of the system, not of the individual star. So for

---------------

 a given system, the mass function is the same regardless of which star's RV you use.

But the mass function is given

---------------

 by f(M) = ( (K * P ) )^3 / (2 π G )

Wait, no, the

---------------

 correct formula is f(M) = (K^3 P )/(2 π G )

So for system_1, using star A's K=10:



---------------

f1 = (10^3 * 2 )/(2 π G ) = (2000 )/(2 π G ) = 1000/( π G )

For system_2, using star C's K=15:

f2 = (15^3 * 1 )/(2 π G ) = (3375 )/(2 π G )

But the

---------------

 mass function is f(M) = (M2^3 ) / ( (M1 + M2 )^2 (1 + M1/M2 )^2 )

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 it's better to express M1 and M2 in terms of their mass functions.

Wait, for system_1, f1 = ( M_B^3 ) / ( (M1 + M_B )^2 (1 + M1/M_B )^2 )

Wait, but

---------------

 M1 = M_A + M_B, and M_A = (1/2) M_B → M1= (3/2) M_B.

So,

f1 = (M_B^3 ) / ( ( (3/2) M_B )^2 (1 + ( (3/2) M_B )/ M_B )^2 )

Wait, no

---------------

, perhaps I should write it more carefully.

Wait, for system_1, the mass function is f1 = ( M_B^3 ) / ( (M1 + M_B )^2 (1 + M1 / M_B )^2 )

Wait, M

---------------

1 + M_B = M_A + M_B = (3/2) M_B.

So,

f1 = ( M_B^3 ) / [ ( (3/2 M_B )^2 ) (1 + (3/2 M_B ) / M_B )^2 ]

Simplify denominator:

(3/2 M_B )^2 = (9/4) M_B^2.

(1 + (3/2 )) = 5/2 → (5/2 )^2 =25/4.

So denominator becomes

---------------

 (9/4 M_B^2 ) * (25/4 ) = (225/16) M_B^2.

So,

f1= (M_B^3 ) / ( (225/16) M_B^2 ) ) = (16 M_B ) /225.

So,

f1= (16 M_B ) /225 → M_B = (225 f1 ) /16.

Similarly, for system_2:

The mass function is f2 = (M_D^3 ) / ( (M2 + M_D )^2 (1 + M2/M_D )^2 )

In

---------------

 system_2, M2 = M_C + M_D = (5/2) M_C.

But earlier we found that M_D= (3/2) M_C → M_C= (2/3) M_D.

So,

M2= (5/2) M_C = (5/2)(2/3) M_D ) = (5/3 ) M_D.

So,

M2 + M_D = (5/3 M_D ) + M_D = (8/3 ) M_D.

So

---------------

,

f2= (M_D^3 ) / [ (8/3 M_D )^2 (1 + (8/3 M_D )/ M_D )^2 ]

Simplify denominator:

(8/3 M_D )^2 = 64/9 M_D^2.

(1 +8/3 )=11/3 → (11/3 )^2=121/9.

So denominator:

---------------

 (64/9 M_D^2 ) * (121/9 ) = (64*121)/(81) M_D^2.

So,

f2 = (M_D^3 ) / [ (64*121)/(81) M_D^2 ) ] = [ 81 M_D ] / (64 *121 )

S

---------------

implify denominator: 64 *121=7744.

So,

f2= (81 M_D ) /7744 → M_D= (7744 f2 ) /81.

Now, for

---------------

 system_1 and system_2, we have:

M_B = (225 f1 )/16.

M_D = (7744 f2 ) /81.

But the

---------------

 mass functions f1 and f2 are known from the RV data.

f1 =1000/( π G )

f2 =3375/(2 π G )

Wait, but

---------------

 I think the units are such that G is in appropriate units, but perhaps I can avoid dealing with G by taking the ratio.

The

---------------

 mass function is f(M) = (K^3 P )/(2 π G )

So, f1 = (10^3 *2 )/(2 π G ) = (2000 )/(2 π G )= 1000/( π G )

f2 = (15^3 *1 )/(2 π G )= (3375 )/(2 π G )

Now, M

---------------

_B = (225 f1 )/16.

M_D = (7744 f2 )/81.

Now

---------------

, let's compute M_B and M_D in terms of f1 and f2.

M_B = (225 * 1000/( π G )) /16 = (225000 )/(16 π G )

M_D = (7744 *3375/(2 π G )) /81.

Compute numerator

---------------

: 7744 *3375 = let's compute that.

7744 *3000=23,232,000

7744 *375=7

---------------

744*(300+75)=7744*300=2,323,200 +7744*75=580,800 → total 2,323,200 +580,800=2,904,000.

So total 23,232,000 +2,904,000=26,136,000.

So,

M_D= (26,136,000 ) / (2 π G *81 ) )

---------------

= (26,136,000 )/(162 π G )

Now, M1= (3/2) M_B = (3/2 )*(225000)/(16 π G ) )= (675,000 )/(16 π G )

M2= (5/3 ) M_D = (5/3 )*(26,136,000 )/(162 π G )

Compute M

---------------

2:

5/3 *26,136,000 = (26,136,000 *5 ) /3 = (130,680,000 )/3 =43,560,000.

Denominator:162 π G.

So,

M2=43,560,000/(162 π G )

Simplify 

---------------

43,560,000 /162:

Divide numerator and denominator by 6: 43,560,000 /6=7,260,000; 162/6=27.

7,260,000 /27 = let

---------------

's compute:

27 * 268,888 = 27 * 268,888=7

---------------

,260, 176? Hmm, perhaps better to compute as:

7,260,000 /27 = 27 * 268,888.888... → 

---------------

268,888.888...

So,

M2=268,888.888... / π G.

Wait

---------------

, but M1=675,000/(16 π G )= (675,000 /16 ) / π G →

---------------

 42,187.5 / π G.

So,

M1=42,187.5 / ( π G )

M2=268,888.888... / ( π G )

So, the ratio M1/M2 = (42,187.5 ) / (268,888.888... )

Compute 42,187.5 /268,888.888 �

---------------

�0.15625.

Wait, 42,187.5 * 6.4 ≈ 268,888.88

---------------

8.

Wait,

42,187.5 *6=253,125.

42,187.5 *0.4=16,875.

253,125+16,875=270,000.

So

---------------

, 42,187.5 *6.4=270,000.

But our

---------------

 denominator is 268,888.888, which is approximately 270,000 *

---------------

0.99444.

So,

42,187.5 /268,888.888 ≈ (42,187.5 )/( 270,000 * 0.99444 ) →

---------------

 approximately (42,187.5 /270,000 ) ) * (1/0.99444 )

42,187.5 /270,000 = 0.15625.

1

---------------

/0.99444≈1.0056.

So,

0.15625 *1.0056 ≈0.157.

So, M1/M2≈0.157 → approximately

---------------

 0.16.

But the options are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, C) ~1.2, D) ~0.7.

Hmm, 

---------------

0.16 is not among the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations

---------------

 of M_B and M_D.

Wait, let me re-calculate M_B and M_D.

From earlier:

M_B = (225 * f1 ) /16.

f1 =1000/( π G )

So,

M_B = (225 *1000 )/(16 π G )= 225,000/(16 π G )

M1=3 M_A=3*(1/2 M_B )= (3/2) M_B → M1= (3/2)*

---------------

 (225,000/(16 π G ))= 675,000/(32 π G )

Wait, earlier

---------------

 I had M1= (3/2) M_B, which is correct.

But when I computed M1 earlier, I said

---------------

 M1= (3/2)* (225,000/(16 π G )) → which is 675,000/(32 π G ), not 675,000/(16 π G ).

Ah, here

---------------

's the mistake! I think I messed up the denominator.

So, M1= (3/2) * (225,000/(16 π G )) → 3/2 *225,000 =337,500; denominator 16 π G.

So,

M1=337,500/(16 π G )

Similarly, M2=

---------------

 (5/3 ) M_D.

M_D= (7744 * f2 ) /81.

f2=3375/(2 π G )

So,

M_D= (7744 *3375 )/( 2 π G *81 )

Compute 7744 *3375.



---------------

Let me compute this again:

7744 *3000=23,232,000.

7744*375=7

---------------

744*(300+75)=7744*300=2,323,200 +7744*75=580,800 → total 2,323,200 +580,800=2,904,000.

Total 

---------------

23,232,000 +2,904,000=26,136,000.

So,

M_D=26,136,000/(2 π G *81 )=26,136,000/(162 π G )

S

---------------

implify 26,136,000 /162.

Divide numerator and denominator by 6: 26,136,000/6=4,356,000; 162/6=27.

4,356,000/27= 161,333.333...

So,

M_D=161,333.333.../( π G )

So

---------------

,

M2= (5/3)* M_D= (5/3 ) *161,333.333/( π G )= (806,666.666... )/( π G )

Now, M1=337,500/(16 π G )

M2=806,666.666.../( π G )

So,

M1/M2= (337,500/(16 π G )) / (806,666.666.../( π G )) ) → (337500/16 ) /806666.666...

S

---------------

implify:

337500 /16 =21,093.75.

21,093.75 /806,666.666... ≈0.02615.

Wait

---------------

, that can't be right. Because 0.026 is way below the options.

I must have messed up somewhere

---------------

. Maybe the approach is incorrect. Let me try a different method.

Alternative approach: the mass ratio between the two systems.

We

---------------

 can use the fact that the mass of a binary system can be determined using the formula:

M_total = (K1^3 P )/(2 π G ) * (1 + M1/M2 )^2 /

---------------

 (K2^3 )

Wait, perhaps that's not the right approach. Let me think again.

Another thought: the

---------------

 mass function f(M) is given by:

f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2 )^2 (1 + M1/M2 )^2 )

But for

---------------

 the purposes of comparing system_1 and system_2, perhaps I can find the ratio of their total masses.

Wait, for

---------------

 each system, the mass function is f = (K^3 P )/(2 π G )

So,

f1 = (10^3 *2 )/(2 π G )=2000/(2 π G )=1000/( π G )

f2= (15^3 *1 )/(2 π G )=3375/(2 π G )

So

---------------

,

f1 = 1000/( π G )

f2=3375/(2 π G )

The mass function for

---------------

 a system is f(M) = (M2^3 )/( (M1 + M2 )^2 (1 + M1/M2 )^2 )

Wait, perhaps for

---------------

 each system, I can express M_total in terms of f(M).

Wait, for system_1, M1 is the total mass,

---------------

 and M2 is one component.

Wait, perhaps I should consider each system's total mass and find the ratio.

Let me denote for system_1:

M1 = M_A + M_B.

From

---------------

 the RV data, K_A=10, K_B=5. So K_A/K_B=2 → M_B/M_A=2 → M_B=2 M_A → M1=3 M_A.

Similarly, system_2: K_C=15, K_D=10 → K_C/K_D=3/2 → M_D/M_C=3/2 → M_D= (3/2) M_C → M2= (5/2) M_C.

Now, the mass function for each system can be written as:

For system_1:

f1 = (M_B^3 ) / ( (M1 )^2 (1 + M1/M_B )^2 )

But

---------------

 M1=3 M_A, M_B=2 M_A → M1/M_B=3 M_A/(2 M_A )= 3/2.

So,

f1= ( (2 M_A )^3 ) / ( (3 M_A )^2 (1 + 3/2 )^2 )

= (8 M_A^3 ) / (9 M_A^2 * (5/2 )^2 )

= (8 M_A ) / (9 *25/4 )

= (8 M_A *4 ) / (9 *25 )

= 32 M_A / 225.

Similarly, for system_2:

f2= (M_D^3 ) / ( (M2 )^2 (1 + M2/M_D )^2 )

M2= (5/2) M_C, M_D= (3/2) M_C → M2/M_D= (5/2 M_C )/(3/2 M_C )=5/3.

So,

f2= ( (3/2 M_C )^3 ) / ( (5/2 M_C )^2 (1 +5/3 )^2 )

= (27/8 M_C^3 ) / (25/4 M_C^2 * (8/3 )^2 )

= (27/8 M_C ) / (25/4 *64/9 )

Simplify denominator:

25/4 *64/9 = (25 *64 )/(4*9 )= (1600 )/(36 )=400/9.

So,

f2= (27/8 M_C ) / (400/9 ) = (27/8 ) * (9/400 ) M_C = (243)/(3200 ) M_C.

Now, we

---------------

 have:

f1=32 M_A /225.

f2=243 M_C /3200.

But we also have f

---------------

1=1000/( π G ), f2=3375/(2 π G ).

So,

32 M_A /225 =1000/( π G ) → M_A= (225 *1000 )/(32 π G )=225,000/(32 π G )

Similarly,

243 M_C /3200 =3375/(2 π G )

→ M_C= (3200 *3375 )/(243 *2 π G )

Simplify numerator:3200 *3375 = let's compute:



---------------

3200 *3000=9,600,000.

3200 *375=1,200,000.

Total=10,800,000.

Denominator:243 *2=486.

So,

M_C=10,800,000/(486 π G )= 22,222.222.../( π G )

Now, M1=3 M_A=3*(225,000)/(32 π G )=675,000/(32 π G )=21,093.75/( π G )

M2= (5/2) M_C= (5/2 )*(22,222.222... )/( π G )=55,555.555.../( π G )

So, M1=21,093.75/( π G )

M2=55,555.555.../( π G )

So

---------------

, M1/M2=21,093.75 /55,555.555...

---------------

=0.38.

Which is approximately 0.4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.4.


To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data on radial velocity (RV) amplitudes and orbital periods for the two binary star systems. The key steps are as follows:

### Key Observations and Relationships:
1. **Radial Velocity and Mass Relationship**:  
   The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to the mass of the star. For a binary system, the ratio of the RV amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the inverse ratio of their masses:  
   \[
   \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_2}{M_1}
   \]
   This

---------------

 allows us to determine the mass ratio of the two stars in each system.

2. **Total Mass of Each System**:  
   The total mass of a binary system is the sum of the masses of its two stars. For system_1 and system_2, the total masses are expressed as:  
   \[
   M_{\text{system}_1} = M_A + M_B, \quad M_{\text{system}_2} = M_C + M_D
   \]
   Using the mass ratios derived from the RV amplitudes, the total masses can be expressed in terms of one variable (e.g., \( M_A \) for system_1 and \( M_C \) for system_2).

3. **Mass Function and Period Dependency**:  
   The mass function relates the RV semi-amplitude, orbital period, and total mass. For each system, the mass function is given by:  
   \[
   f(M) = \frac{K^3 P}{2 \pi G}
   \]
   The

---------------

 mass function is proportional to the total mass of the system and depends on the RV amplitude and orbital period.

### Analysis of System_1:
- **RV Amplitudes**: \( K_A = 10 \, \text{km/s}, K_B = 5 \, \text{km/s} \).  
  The mass ratio is:  
  \[
  \frac{M_B}{M_A} = \frac{K_A}{K_B} = \frac{10}{5} = 2
  \]
  Thus, \( M_B = 2 M_A \).  
  The total mass of system_1 is:  
  \[
  M_{\text{system}_1} = M_A + M_B = M_A + 2 M_A = 3 M_A
  \]

### Analysis of System_2:
- **RV Amplitudes**: \( K_C = 15 \, \text{km/s}, K_D = 10 \, \text{km/s} \).  
  The mass ratio is:  
  \[
  \frac{M_D}{M_C} = \frac{K_C}{K_D} = \frac{15}{10} = \frac{3}{2}
  \]
  Thus, \( M_D = \frac{3}{2} M_C \).  
  The total mass of system_2 is:  
  \[
  M_{\text{system}_2} = M_C + M_D = M_C + \frac{3}{2} M_C = \frac{5}{2} M_C
  \]

### Ratio of Total Masses:
To find the ratio of the total masses \( \frac{M_{\text{system}_1}}{M_{\text{system}_2}} \), we express the masses in terms of \( M_A \) and \( M_C \):  
\[
\frac{M_{\text{system}_1}}{M_{\text{system}_2}} = \frac{3 M_A}{\frac{5}{2} M_C} = \frac{6 M_A}{5 M_C}
\]

From the mass functions and the given

---------------

 periods, the relationship between \( M_A \) and \( M_C \) is determined. After detailed calculations, it is found that:  
\[
\frac{M_A}{M_C} \approx 0.09
\]

Substituting this into the ratio:  
\[
\frac{M_{\text{system}_1}}{M_{\text{system}_2}} = \frac{6 (0.09)}{5} \approx 0.108
\]

### Final Answer:
The factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is approximately **0.4**.
