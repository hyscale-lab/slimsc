Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state. The options are given as A to D.

First, I remember that in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are

---------------

 a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which I think corresponds to the vibrational ground state (v=0) and the rotational ground state (maybe

---------------

 J=0 or J=1? Wait, for diatomic molecules, the rotational state J starts at 0, but the

---------------

 selection rules might allow transitions. Or wait, no, for rigid rotor, the energy levels are quantized with J as integer values starting

---------------

 from 0.)

Wait, the question is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I

---------------

 think that would involve a transition where the energy increases the least. That probably means either a vibrational transition or a rotational one, whichever requires less energy.

But

---------------

 wait, the problem mentions the non-rigid rotor model, which probably includes both rotation and vibration. So the total energy would be the sum of rotational and vibrational energies.

The

---------------

 fundamental state is the lowest energy. The next state would be the next higher energy level. But how do these states combine? Do

---------------

 they form a single energy level each, or are they multiple levels? I'm a bit confused.

Let me think. The molecule

---------------

 is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0).

---------------

 To go to the next state, the molecule would need to absorb a photon that provides the least possible energy. So the photon

---------------

's energy should match the energy difference between the fundamental state and the next possible state.

What's the next possible state after (v=0, J=0)? It

---------------

 could be either increasing v by 1 (v=1) or increasing J by 1 (J=1). Which

---------------

 one requires less energy?

I remember that the vibrational energy levels are given by the formula E_vibrational = (v + 1/2) ħω, where ω is the angular frequency. The rotational energy is E_rotational = (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

So the

---------------

 energy difference for a vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1 is ΔE_vib = ħω. For rotational, from J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is ΔE_rot = (ħ²(

---------------

2))/(2I) = ħ²/(I).

Which one is smaller? It depends on the value of ħω and ħ²/(I).

I

---------------

 should calculate both and compare.

Wait, let's compute I first. I is the moment of inertia, which is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

The reduced

---------------

 mass μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Given Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But wait, I

---------------

 need to convert amu into kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605×10^-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605 is about 3.023

---------------

e-27 kg.

Wait, 1.818 * 1.6605 is approximately:

1.8 * 1.66 is about 2.988. 

---------------

0.018 *1.66 is about 0.02988. So total about 3.0178e-27 kg.

So

---------------

 μ ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

The bond length r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r = 2e-10 m.

So I = μ r² = (3.018e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = (3.018e-27) * 4e-20 = 1.2072e-46 kg m².

Now, let

---------------

's compute ΔE_rot. That's (ħ²)/(2I) for J=0 to J=1. Wait, wait

---------------

. The rotational energy for J is E_rot = [J (J+1) ħ² ] / (2I). So when

---------------

 J=0, E=0. When J=1, E_rot = (2 ħ²)/(2I) = ħ²/(I).

So ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I).

ħ

---------------

 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ² is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

So

---------------

 ΔE_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.2072e-46 ≈ 

---------------

9.21e-23 J.

Wait, let me compute that again. 1.112e-68 divided by 1.2072e-46 is

---------------

 equal to (1.112 / 1.2072) * 1e-22 �

---------------

� approximately 0.921 * 1e-22 ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

Hmm, that

---------------

's the energy difference for the rotational transition.

Now, the vibrational energy difference ΔE_vib is ħω. �

---------------

� is 4e14 rad/s.

So ħω = (1.0545718e-34 J s) * (4e14 rad/s) = 4.218e-20 J.

Wait

---------------

, 4.218e-20 J is the vibrational energy difference.

So which is smaller: 9.21e-23 J (rotational) or 4.218e-20 J (vibrational)? The

---------------

 rotational is smaller by about three orders of magnitude.

So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the rotational transition, from

---------------

 J=0 to J=1.

So the photon must have energy equal to ΔE_rot = 9.21e-23 J.

But wait, the

---------------

 question asks for the momentum of the photon. Oh right, because photons carry energy and momentum. The energy of a photon is E = hf = pc, where h is Planck's constant, f is frequency, p is momentum, and c is speed of light.

So E

---------------

 = pc → p = E/c.

Wait, but c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = (9.21e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, that's the

---------------

 momentum. But wait, looking at the options, none of them are around 3e-31. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C) 1.1e-27

D) 1.4e-28

Hmm, none

---------------

 of these are 3e-31. Did I make a mistake in calculations?

Wait a second, maybe I mixed

---------------

 up the energy differences. Because the fundamental state might be a combination of both vibrational and rotational states. Or perhaps the next

---------------

 state is a vibrational transition, which requires higher energy than the rotational, but the question is about the next state regardless of whether

---------------

 it's a higher vibrational or rotational state.

Wait, but the problem states the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the lowest energy. The next state would

---------------

 be the next higher energy level. So perhaps the next state is the first excited state, which could be either rotational or vibrational. But

---------------

 since the rotational transition requires less energy, the photon must supply that.

Wait, but according to my calculation, the rotational energy difference is 

---------------

9.21e-23 J, which would correspond to a photon momentum of 3e-31 kg m/s. But the options are much

---------------

 larger. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe the model considers both rotational and vibrational changes

---------------

. Oh wait, perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state to the first excited state, which could involve a combination of rotational

---------------

 and vibrational changes. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the model is such that the fundamental state is the lowest

---------------

 vibrational state (v=0) with the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state could be the next vibr

---------------

ational state (v=1) but with J=0, or the same vibrational state with J=1.

Which

---------------

 one has a lower energy difference? As I calculated earlier, the rotational transition requires less energy, so the photon's energy would be in

---------------

 the rotational transition.

Wait, but wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of the moment of inertia. Let me double-check.

μ

---------------

 is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (22) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Con

---------------

verting 1.818 amu to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

Bond length r = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = (3.018e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2072e-46 kg m².

Then

---------------

, ΔE_rot = ( (1) (1+1) ħ² ) / (2I) - 0 =

---------------

 (2 ħ²)/(2I) = ħ²/(I).

Wait, so ħ² is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

So ħ² / I = 1.112e-68 / 1.2072e-46 = approximately

---------------

 9.21e-23 J. That's correct.

Then, E_photon = 9.21e-23 J.

M

---------------

omentum p = E/c = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 = approximately 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the

---------------

 options don't have this. Hmm. Did I get the wrong energy difference?

Wait, maybe I should consider the vibrational energy.

---------------

 Let me compute that again.

ΔE_vib = ħ ω = 1.05457e-34 * 4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

Which

---------------

 is about 4e-20 J, which is way bigger than the rotational 9e-23 J.

So the rotational

---------------

 transition is lower energy. So the photon should have p=3e-31 kg m/s.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps

---------------

 I'm wrong about the next state.

Alternatively, perhaps the next state isn't a pure rotational state but a combination of rotational

---------------

 and vibrational.

Wait, maybe the energy levels are such that the next state is the first excited vibrational state. Because

---------------

 perhaps the rotational transitions are forbidden or have some selection rules.

Wait, the selection rules for diatomic molecules: for pure rotational transitions, ΔJ = ±1. But for

---------------

 vibrational transitions, Δv = ±1. But in the context of the rotation-vibration model, perhaps the transitions are considered

---------------

 where both rotational and vibrational quantum numbers can change.

Wait, but in the problem, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is (v=0, J=0). The next state would be the next

---------------

 higher energy level, which could be (v=1, J=0), (v=0, J=1), or even

---------------

 (v=1, J=1). But the lowest energy next state would be either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1), whichever has lower energy.

As

---------------

 I calculated, (v=0, J=1) is lower in energy than (v=1, J=0). So the photon's

---------------

 energy should be the rotational energy.

Wait, but the options don't have anything near 3e-31. So

---------------

 perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule in a non-rigid rotor model, which might

---------------

 include the effect of bond vibrations on the moment of inertia. But I'm not sure how that would affect the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question

---------------

 is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule transitions to the next state, which could be a combination of a vibrational and rotational change. But I'm not sure about

---------------

 that.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the molecule's transition involves both a vibrational and rotational change, but that would be

---------------

 a higher energy than either alone. But that's not the next lowest state.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the

---------------

 calculation of the rotational energy difference.

Let me recalculate the rotational energy difference.

I = μ r² = ( (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) ) * (1e-27 kg/amu) * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I made a mistake in converting amu to kg.

Wait, 20 amu is 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg.

Similarly, 2 amu is 3.321e-27 kg? Wait, 2 * 1.6605e-27 is 3.321e-27 kg.

So μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (22 amu) = (40)/(22) amu = 1.81818 amu.

So

---------------

 1.81818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu = 

---------------

1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 = approximately 3.018e-27 kg.

So

---------------

 that part was correct.

I = μ r² = (3.018e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2.

2e-10 squared is 4e-20 m². So I = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

Then

---------------

, E_rot for J=1 is (1*2) * ħ²/(2I) )= 2 * (ħ²/(2I)) )= ħ²/(I).

So �

---------------

� is 1.05457e-34 J s.

So ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

So

---------------

 E_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.207e-46 = approx

---------------

 9.21e-23 J.

So E_rot is 9.21e-23 J. So

---------------

 p = E/c = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 = approx 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But none

---------------

 of the options match this. So perhaps the question is considering the transition to the first vibrational state instead.

Wait, let

---------------

's calculate the photon momentum for the vibrational transition.

E_photon_vib = ħω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

p = E/c = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s.

Looking

---------------

 at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 N s. Because 1 N s = 1 kg m/s, so that

---------------

 matches.

But wait, earlier calculation shows that the rotational transition has lower energy, so the photon should have lower momentum. But according

---------------

 to the options, the correct answer would be D if the transition is vibrational. But why would the next state be vibrational then

---------------

?

Hmm, maybe the rotational transition is not allowed. Maybe the selection rules for rotation and vibration apply. For example, in infrared

---------------

 spectroscopy, vibrational transitions are allowed with Δv = ±1, and rotational transitions can accompany them with ΔJ = ±1. So perhaps

---------------

 the question is considering a vibrational transition with a rotational change.

Wait, but the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, and we

---------------

 need the photon to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So if the rotational transition is lower energy, why

---------------

 is the photon's momentum based on the vibrational transition?

Alternatively, perhaps the model used here is such that the energy levels are quant

---------------

ized but the molecule can only undergo vibrational transitions, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering

---------------

 the molecule as a rigid rotor and not a non-rigid rotor. Wait, the question says it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which is the non-rigid rotor. So the

---------------

 model accounts for both rotation and vibration.

So the energy levels are a combination of both, and the next state could be a combination

---------------

 of a vibrational and rotational state. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the energy levels are such that the next

---------------

 state is the first vibrational level, which would require the photon to have energy equal to the vibrational energy difference. That

---------------

 would give a momentum of about 1.4e-28 kg m/s, which is option D.

But why would the next state be a vibrational transition if

---------------

 the rotational is lower? Maybe because in the non-rigid rotor model, the vibrational energy is a part of the energy

---------------

, and the rotational states are higher in energy when the bond length changes.

Wait, perhaps the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state with the lowest rotational state, and the next state is the first vibrational state,

---------------

 even though it's higher in energy than a rotational state. But that contradicts the earlier calculation that the rotational transition requires less energy.

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps I messed up the energy levels. Maybe the rotational energy is higher than the vibrational one. But according to my calculations, the

---------------

 rotational transition's energy is lower.

Wait, let me recompute the rotational energy.

Wait, perhaps I forgot a factor. The rotational energy for

---------------

 J=1 is (J(J+1) ħ²)/(2I) = (2 ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

So

---------------

 that's correct. And the vibrational energy is ħω.

So 9e-23 J vs. 4e-20 J. So

---------------

 rotational is way lower.

But the options don't have the 3e-31 kg m/s. So perhaps I'm

---------------

 missing something.

Wait, maybe the question is about the transition from the (v=0, J=0) state to the (v=0, J=1) state, which is a pure rotational transition. So

---------------

 the photon's energy is the rotational energy, which is 9.21e-23 J, leading to p=3e-31 kg m/s.

But the

---------------

 options don't have that. So perhaps the question is actually about the transition to the next vibrational state, ignoring the rotational possibilities

---------------

. But that doesn't make sense because the rotational transition is lower in energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the moment of inertia. Let me double

---------------

-check.

Wait, bond length is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m. So r^2 is 4e-20 m².

μ is 1.818 amu,

---------------

 which is 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = approx 3.018e-27 kg.

So I = μ r² = 3.018e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m². Correct.

So

---------------

 E_rot = (ħ²)/(I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / 1.207e-46.

Wait

---------------

, let me compute that again.

(1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68.

1.112e-68 / 1.207e-46 = 

---------------

9.21e-23 J. Correct.

Hmm.

So perhaps the options are incorrect, but that's unlikely. Let

---------------

 me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state, which is a combination of a vibrational and rotational change, but that's a

---------------

 higher energy. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the first allowed transition, which could be vibrational.

Alternatively, perhaps the question

---------------

 is considering the molecule's transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited vibrational state (v=1, J=0), which would require the

---------------

 photon to have energy equal to the vibrational energy.

In that case, E_photon = ħω = 4.218e-20 J, which

---------------

 would give p = 4.218e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s, which is option D.

But earlier calculation

---------------

 shows that the rotational transition requires less energy. So why would the next state be a higher energy transition?

Maybe I'm missing

---------------

 something about the selection rules or the model. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is in a non-rigid rotor model, so the moment

---------------

 of inertia varies with vibration, but I'm not sure how that affects the transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition,

---------------

 and the rotational transitions are not considered here. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule's fundamental state is the first

---------------

 rotational state, but that doesn't make sense because J=0 is the ground state.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let

---------------

's look at the options again.

The options are:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C) 1.1e-27

D) 1.4e-28

If

---------------

 I consider the vibrational transition, p=1.4e-28, which is option D.

If I consider the rotational, p=3e-31, which isn't present.

So

---------------

 perhaps the correct answer is D.

But why? Because maybe the next state is a vibrational transition, not rotational.

Wait, perhaps the molecule

---------------

 is modeled in such a way that the vibrational energy is the main contributor, and the rotational transitions are higher. Or perhaps the selection

---------------

 rules allow only vibrational transitions in this context.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the rotational transition is not possible because J

---------------

 must change by 1, but perhaps the molecule is in a state where J can't go lower, so the only possible

---------------

 transition is vibrational.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question says, "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the

---------------

 next state would be the state with the next lowest energy, which could be either the first rotational state or the first vibrational state. Since

---------------

 the rotational state is lower in energy, the photon should have that energy. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the question

---------------

 is expecting the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me try

---------------

 again.

Wait, E_rot for J=1 is (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/I. Correct

---------------

.

Wait, let me compute ħ²/(I):

ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 = 

---------------

1.112e-68 J² s².

I = 1.207e-46 kg m².

So E_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.207e-46 = 

---------------

9.21e-23 J.

Hmm. So E_rot is 9.21e-23 J, which is about

---------------

 9e-23 J.

Photon's momentum p = E_rot / c = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait

---------------

, but this isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moment of inertia.

Wait, bond length is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m. So r² is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

μ

---------------

 is (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) =40/22= 1.818 amu.

1

---------------

.818 amu in kg is 1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg= approx

---------------

 3.018e-27 kg.

So I = μ r² = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 =1.207e-46 kg m².

So

---------------

 I think the calculation is correct. So why isn't the answer matching the options?

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rigid

---------------

 rotor model, which doesn't include vibration. But the question states it's the non-rigid rotor model, which includes both.

Wait, another

---------------

 possibility: perhaps the problem is using the harmonic oscillator approximation for the vibrational energy, but that doesn't change the fact that the vibrational transition is higher than rotational.

Alternatively, perhaps the question

---------------

 is about the transition from the (v=0, J=0) state to the (v=1, J=0) state, which would require a photon with energy equal to the vibrational energy.

In that case, p = (

---------------

ħω)/c = (1.05457e-34 *4e14)/3e8 = (4.218e-20)/3e8 =1.406e-28 kg m/s.

Which is option D.

But then

---------------

 why would that be the next state? Because the rotational transition requires less energy.

Wait, perhaps the rotational transition isn't allowed,

---------------

 perhaps due to selection rules. For example, in rotational transitions, the dipole selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. But for

---------------

 a diatomic molecule, a photon must cause a change in dipole moment, which depends on the molecule's symmetry. If

---------------

 the molecule is such that a rotational transition is forbidden, then the next possible transition would be vibrational.

But the question doesn't provide any information about selection rules, so I have

---------------

 to assume that the next state is the one with the least energy difference, which would be the rotational transition.

But since the options don't include that, perhaps the question is expecting

---------------

 the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy, and the actual energy is higher than I thought.

Wait, another

---------------

 approach: perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state in the rotational-vibrational coupling, which might have a different energy.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited vibrational state (v=1, J=0), which would require the photon to have energy equal to the vibrational energy. So

---------------

 the answer would be D.

In that case, the correct option is D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences associated with rotational and vibrational transitions.

### Key Information:
1. **Molecular Parameters**:
   - Mass of atom X: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \)
   - Mass of atom Y: \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
   - Bond length: \( r = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
   - Angular frequency of vibration: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

2. **Reduced Mass**:
   The reduced mass \( \mu \) is calculated as:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
   \]
   Converting to kilograms:
   \[
   \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
   \]

3. **Moment of Inertia**:
   The moment of inertia \( I \) is:
   \[
   I = \mu r^2 = (3.018 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2072 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2.
   \]

4. **Energy Differences**:
   - **Rotational Transition**: The energy difference for a transition from \( J = 0 \) to \( J = 1 \) is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}.
     \]
     Using \( \hbar \approx 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{s} \):
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.2072 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
     \]
   - **Vibrational Transition**: The energy difference for a transition from \( v = 0 \) to \( v = 1 \) is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
     \]

5. **Photon Momentum**:
   The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).
   - For the rotational transition:
     \[
     p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.21 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}.
     \]
   - For the vibrational transition:
     \[
     p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}.
     \]

### Analysis:
- The rotational transition requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition (\( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \ll \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \)). However, the options provided do not include the momentum corresponding to the rotational transition (\( p_{\text{rot}} \)).
- The vibrational transition corresponds to a photon momentum of approximately \( 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s} \), which matches option D.

### Conclusion:
Given the options and the calculations, the correct answer is the vibrational transition, as it aligns with the provided choices.
