Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating non-Gaussianity using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The state given is a Schrödinger cat state. The state vector is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. I

---------------

 remember that |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states, right? And N is the normalization constant. The normalization N

---------------

 is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha²)). 

The task is to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure. The formula provided is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

Wait, non

---------------

-Gaussian states are those that can't be described by Gaussian statistics, like coherent, squeezed, or thermal states. So the

---------------

 question is about measuring how non-Gaussian this particular state is.

The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. So

---------------

 let's plug those in.

First, let's compute N. N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha²)). Let's compute sin(2phi) when phi is -pi/4. 2phi is -pi/2, so sin(-pi/2) is -1. Then

---------------

 exp(-2*(0.5)^2) is exp(-0.5) which is about 0.6065. So sin(2phi)*exp(...) is (-1)*0.6065 = -0.6065. So

---------------

 1 + (-0.6065) is 0.3935. Then N is sqrt(0.3935) which is approximately 0.6275.

So the state |psi> is (cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5>)/0.6275.

Cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2, which

---------------

 is about 0.7071. Sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2, same

---------------

 magnitude, but negative. So the coefficients are 0.7071 and -0.7071, but

---------------

 divided by N.

Wait, but wait: in the state, it's cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>. So

---------------

 with phi=-pi/4, cos(phi)=sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi)=-sqrt(2)/2. So the state becomes [ (sqrt(2)/2)|0.5> - (sqrt(2)/2)|-0.5> ] / N.

But

---------------

 the exact values might not matter yet. Let's think about the density matrices. The state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states. Co

---------------

herent states are Gaussian states, but their superposition is non-Gaussian. So the state rho is non-Gaussian, and tau is a Gaussian state,

---------------

 perhaps a coherent state or maybe the maximally mixed Gaussian state.

Wait, the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is the

---------------

 difference between the von Neumann entropy of rho and tau. But wait, the formula given is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Wait

---------------

, that's actually the von Neumann entropy of rho minus that of tau. So S(rho) - S(tau). Since

---------------

 entropy is always positive, but I'm not sure if del_b can be negative. Wait, but non-Gaussian states usually

---------------

 have higher entropy compared to Gaussian states? Or maybe it's the other way around. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the

---------------

 relative entropy is a measure of how different rho is from tau. So if rho is non-Gaussian, and tau is a Gaussian state, then

---------------

 if rho is more mixed, the entropy S(rho) would be higher, so del_b would be positive. But I

---------------

'm not entirely certain.

Wait, but the problem is about the non-Gaussianity, which is the relative entropy between rho and a reference Gaussian state. So to

---------------

 compute nG, I need to compute the relative entropy, which is S(rho) - S(tau). But wait

---------------

, no, the relative entropy is usually defined as S(rho || tau) = Tr(rho log rho) - Tr(rho log tau). Oh wait, that

---------------

's different. Wait, in this problem, the formula given is del_b = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). So that's S(rho) - S(tau), where

---------------

 S is the von Neumann entropy. Because S(rho) is Tr(rho ln rho), and similarly for tau.

So the

---------------

 non-Gaussianity is the difference in the entropies. But wait, wait. The von Neumann entropy of a Gaussian state can

---------------

 sometimes be higher or lower than a non-Gaussian state, depending on the situation. For example, if the Gaussian state is a

---------------

 coherent state, it's a pure state, so S(tau) would be zero. But the non-Gaussian state here

---------------

 is a superposition, which is a pure state as well. So in that case, S(rho) would be zero, and

---------------

 S(tau) would be zero, so del_b would be zero. That can't be right. So perhaps the reference Gaussian state is not a pure state.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the maximally mixed Gaussian state. Or perhaps it's the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as the non-Gaussian state. Wait

---------------

, but I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the one that minimizes the relative entropy.

---------------

 So it's the Gaussian state closest to rho in some sense. But I'm not exactly sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is a thermal

---------------

 state or a squeezed state. Hmm.

But wait, let's think about the state |psi>. It's a superposition of two coherent states. The

---------------

 density matrix rho would be |psi><psi|, which is a pure state. So S(rho) is zero, since rho is pure. But

---------------

 what about tau? If tau is a Gaussian state, perhaps a maximally mixed Gaussian state. Or maybe it's a Gaussian

---------------

 state that best approximates rho.

Wait, but wait. The von Neumann entropy is zero for a pure state. So if tau is a Gaussian state that's also pure, then S(tau) is zero. Then del_b would be zero. But that

---------------

 can't be the case, because the options don't include zero except option D. Hmm, but wait, the problem says

---------------

 "relative entropy measure", which is the formula given. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the relative entropy of

---------------

 non-Gaussianity. Another possibility is that the non-Gaussianity is computed with respect to a specific Gaussian state, perhaps

---------------

 the maximally mixed one. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the vacuum state. But

---------------

 the vacuum state is a Gaussian state, and if rho is a superposition of coherent states, which are displaced vacuum states, then the

---------------

 entropy difference could be something else.

Wait, maybe I should compute the density matrices for both rho and tau. Let's see

---------------

.

The state |psi> is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. So rho

---------------

 is |psi><psi|.

But what is the reference Gaussian state tau? The problem says tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. So

---------------

 perhaps tau is a Gaussian state that is the closest to rho in some sense, but without knowing more, it's hard to say

---------------

.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the maximally mixed Gaussian state with the same purity as rho. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but

---------------

 in the case where the state is a superposition of two coherent states, the density matrix rho is a pure state, so

---------------

 S(rho) = 0. The reference Gaussian state might be a mixed state, perhaps a thermal state, which has a certain entropy. So

---------------

 if tau is a Gaussian state with the same purity as rho, but being Gaussian, maybe it has a different entropy.

Wait, but

---------------

 I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the properties of the state.

Wait, let's compute N first. For

---------------

 phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

N = sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) * exp(-2 alpha²)).

2

---------------

 phi is -pi/2. sin(-pi/2) is -1.

exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

So N = sqrt(1 + (-1)(0.6065)) = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state |psi> is [ cos(-pi/4) |0.5> + sin(-pi/4) | -0.5> ] / 0.6275.

cos

---------------

(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071, sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

So |psi> = [0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 | -0.5> ] / 0.6275.

But

---------------

 wait, coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha> are orthogonal when alpha is real and non-zero. Because <alpha| -alpha> = exp(-|alpha|^2) e

---------------

^{2i Im(alpha)}, but since alpha is real (as given), the overlap is exp(-alpha²) e^{0} = exp(-alpha²). Wait, but

---------------

 for real alpha, |alpha> and |-alpha> are not orthogonal unless alpha is zero.

Wait, let me compute <alpha | -alpha> =

---------------

 exp(-|alpha|^2) e^{2i Im(alpha)}. Since alpha is real, Im(alpha)=0, so <alpha| -alpha> = exp(-alpha^2).

So

---------------

 for alpha=0.5, this is exp(-0.25) ≈ 0.7788.

So

---------------

 the inner product is not zero, so the states |alpha> and |-alpha> are not orthogonal. So the state |psi> is a superposition of two non-orthogonal states.

But

---------------

 perhaps I'm getting too deep into that. Let's think about the density matrix rho. rho is |psi><psi|, which would

---------------

 be a pure state, so its entropy is zero.

Wait, but the problem is about the relative entropy measure with respect to a Gaussian state. So if

---------------

 tau is a Gaussian state, perhaps the vacuum state, which is a pure Gaussian state, then S(tau)=0 as well. So del_b would be zero minus zero, which is zero. But that

---------------

's option D. So the answer would be D) 0.

Wait, but that can't be right because the state is non-Gaussian, but perhaps

---------------

 the relative entropy isn't zero because the states are different. Hmm, but relative entropy being zero would imply that the states are identical, which they are not. So maybe

---------------

 I'm missing something.

Wait, no. The relative entropy as defined here is S(rho) - S(tau), not the usual relative entropy which

---------------

 is S(rho || tau). So if rho is pure (S(rho)=0) and tau is a pure Gaussian state (S(tau)=0), then del_b would be zero. But that

---------------

 doesn't make sense because the state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity shouldn't be zero. So maybe the reference Gaussian state isn't pure.

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state isn't pure. Maybe

---------------

 it's a maximally mixed Gaussian state, which would have maximum entropy. For a single mode, the maximum entropy Gaussian state is the thermal state with the highest possible entropy, which is when the temperature is infinite, so

---------------

 it's the vacuum. Wait, no, the vacuum is pure, so maybe it's the completely mixed state, but for

---------------

 Gaussian states, the completely mixed state isn't Gaussian unless it's a thermal state with some parameters.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is a coherent

---------------

 state with the same first moment as rho. Wait, but rho is a superposition, so its first moment might be different

---------------

.

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the one that has the same first and second moments as rho, but is Gaussian. So

---------------

 to find tau, we'd have to compute the first and second moments of rho and then construct a Gaussian state with those moments.

But that

---------------

's complicated. Let me think. The state |psi> is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, so let

---------------

's compute the expectation values.

The expectation value of the position operator x would be (since coherent states have expectation values proportional to alpha):



---------------

But wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the first and second moments.

The density matrix rho is |psi><psi|. So the

---------------

 first moment <x> would be Tr(rho x), and the second moment <x²> would be Tr(rho x²).

But calculating

---------------

 that might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states, so the expectation value of x would be [

---------------

cos^2(phi) alpha + sin^2(phi) (-alpha)] / N^2. Wait, but let's see.

Wait, more

---------------

 accurately, the expectation value <x> is given by:

Tr(rho x) = [ <alpha| + < -alpha | ] (cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) | -alpha> ) / N^2 *

---------------

 x (cos(phi) <alpha| + sin(phi) < -alpha | ) ) 

Wait, maybe I'm getting too

---------------

 stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the Wigner function of the state. A superposition of two coherent states would have a Wigner function that is non-positive in some regions, which is a hallmark of non-Gaussianity.

But I

---------------

'm not making progress. Let me think about the options. The options are A) 2.48, B) 0.25, C) 1.38, D) 0.

If the non

---------------

-Gaussianity is the difference in entropies, and if the state is pure (S(rho)=0) and the reference Gaussian state is also pure (S(tau)=0), then the del_b would be zero. So the non-Gaussianity would be zero, which is option D.

But that can't be correct because the state is non-Gaussian. Wait

---------------

, but the relative entropy as defined here is the difference between the entropies of rho and tau, not the relative entropy between

---------------

 rho and tau. So if both are pure, the difference is zero, implying no non-Gaussianity. But that seems

---------------

 counterintuitive.

Alternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state isn't pure. Maybe it's a maximally mixed state, which would have S

---------------

(tau) = 1 (in nats, or ln 2 units if using base 2), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the reference Gaussian state is the vacuum, which is pure. So S(rho)=0, S(tau)=0, del_b=0.

But then

---------------

 why is the non-Gaussianity zero? Because both are pure states, but one is non-Gaussian. Hmm, that

---------------

 doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the definition of non-Gaussianity here.

Wait, another approach: perhaps

---------------

 the relative entropy measure for non-Gaussianity is defined as the relative entropy between the state rho and the closest Gaussian state tau. But

---------------

 in that case, it's not just the difference in entropies; it's the full relative entropy.

Wait, the formula

---------------

 given is del_b = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau) = S(rho) - S(tau). But

---------------

 the relative entropy between rho and tau is usually S(rho || tau) = S(rho) - S(rho_t

---------------

ilde) where rho_tilde is the state that minimizes the entropy. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the problem is referring to the relative entropy between rho and tau as the measure. But the given formula isn't the standard relative entropy. Because

---------------

 the standard relative entropy is S(rho || tau) = Tr(rho (ln rho - ln tau)). That's different

---------------

 from what's given here.

So according to the problem, del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)] = S(rho) - S(tau).

But

---------------

 if rho is a non-Gaussian state and tau is a Gaussian state, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is S(rho) - S(tau). But

---------------

 in the case where rho is a pure state (S(rho)=0) and tau is a pure Gaussian state (S(tau)=0), del_b would be zero. So the non-Gaussianity would be zero, which is option D.

But that

---------------

 seems to suggest that the non-Gaussian state has zero non-Gaussianity, which can't be right. So perhaps I'm missing something.



---------------

Wait, maybe the reference Gaussian state isn't a pure state. Maybe it's a maximally mixed Gaussian state. Let's think

---------------

: for a single mode, the maximum entropy Gaussian state is the thermal state with infinite temperature, which is the vacuum. Wait

---------------

, no, the vacuum is pure. The maximally mixed Gaussian state for a single mode is the completely depolarized state, which has

---------------

 entropy S=1 (in nats) for a single qubit, but for a continuous variable system, I'm not sure. Wait

---------------

, perhaps in this case, the reference Gaussian state is the completely mixed Gaussian state, which has the maximum possible entropy for a Gaussian state. Then

---------------

, S(tau) would be higher, making del_b positive.

But without knowing the exact form of tau, it's hard to compute. Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps the problem is designed in such a way that the non-Gaussianity is zero. Maybe because the state is a super

---------------

position of two coherent states with equal amplitudes and opposite phases, leading to a Gaussian state.

Wait, wait. Let

---------------

 me think again about the state. The state is |psi> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N.

If

---------------

 phi is such that cos(phi) = sin(phi), then |psi> is (|alpha> + |-alpha>)/sqrt(2 N

---------------

^2), but perhaps in this case, the state might be Gaussian.

Wait, when phi is -pi/4, cos(phi) = sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi) = -sqrt(2)/2. So the state becomes [ |alpha> - |-alpha> ] / (sqrt(2) N ). Hmm

---------------

, but wait, when alpha is real, |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states with real amplitudes, and their difference could

---------------

 lead to a non-Gaussian state.

Alternatively, perhaps for certain parameters, the state becomes Gaussian. For example, when the state is a cat state, which is a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases, it

---------------

's known to be highly non-Gaussian. But wait, in some cases, like when the two amplitudes are orthogonal

---------------

, perhaps the state becomes a squeezed state, which is Gaussian.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the case when the state is a super

---------------

position of two coherent states that are orthogonal. If |alpha> and |-alpha> are orthogonal, then the state |psi> would be a maximally mixed state,

---------------

 which is a pure state but non-Gaussian. But in our case, alpha is 0.5, so |alpha> and |-alpha> are not orthogonal because

---------------

 <alpha| -alpha> = exp(-alpha^2) = exp(-0.25) ≈ 0.7788, so they are not orthogonal.

So

---------------

 |psi> is a superposition of two non-orthogonal coherent states. Now, what's the density matrix rho? rho = |psi><psi|.

But

---------------

 regardless, the state is a pure state, so S(rho)=0.

If the reference Gaussian state tau is also pure, then S(tau)=0, so del_b=0, which

---------------

 would be option D. But that can't be right because the state is non-Gaussian. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is not pure. Maybe

---------------

 it's the maximally mixed Gaussian state. Let's say that the entropy of tau is S(tau)=1. Then, since S(rho)=0, del_b = 0 - 1 = -1. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the vacuum, which is pure (S(tau)=0), so del_b=0. But

---------------

 that would suggest that the non-Gaussianity is zero, which contradicts the expectation.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the problem

---------------

 statement again. The relative entropy measure is given as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So it

---------------

's the difference in the von Neumann entropies. If rho is a pure state, S(rho)=0. If tau is a pure Gaussian state, then S(tau)=0. So del_b=0.

But that

---------------

 can't be right because the state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero. But according

---------------

 to the problem, the options include D) 0. So perhaps the answer is D) 0. But why?

Wait, maybe the non

---------------

-Gaussianity is zero because the state is actually Gaussian. How? Because the state |psi> is a Gaussian state.

Wait, can

---------------

 a superposition of two coherent states be Gaussian? Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superpositions are usually non-Gaussian. But

---------------

 under certain conditions, perhaps it's Gaussian.

Wait, for example, if the two coherent states are orthogonal and have the same amplitude, the

---------------

 superposition could be a squeezed state, which is Gaussian. But in our case, |alpha> and |-alpha> are not orthogonal,

---------------

 so that's not the case.

Wait, but wait. Let's compute the Wigner function of |psi> to see if it's Gaussian.

The Wigner function of a coherent state |alpha> is Gaussian. The Wigner function of a superposition of two coherent states is non-Gaussian. So the

---------------

 state |psi> must be non-Gaussian, implying that the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.

But according to the calculation

---------------

, del_b is zero because both rho and tau are pure. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is not a pure state. Maybe

---------------

 it's a mixed state, and tau is the maximally mixed Gaussian state. In that case, S(tau) would be higher

---------------

 than zero. So del_b would be S(rho) - S(tau) = 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau). But then

---------------

 del_b would be negative, but the options don't have negative numbers.

Wait, perhaps the formula is the other way around. Maybe it's S(tau) - S(rho). But

---------------

 the problem states it's [rho ln rho] - [tau ln tau], which would be S(rho) - S(tau). So if S(rho) is less than S(tau), del_b would be negative.

Hmm. I

---------------

'm stuck. Maybe the answer is D) 0 because the non-Gaussianity is defined as the difference between the ent

---------------

ropies, and for pure states, it's zero regardless of whether the state is Gaussian or not.

But that doesn't make sense because

---------------

 non-Gaussian states should have non-zero non-Gaussianity. So perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the state is Gaussian,

---------------

 making the non-Gaussianity zero.

Wait, when can a superposition of coherent states be Gaussian? Only if the superposition leads

---------------

 to a state that is a Gaussian state. For example, a squeezed state is a Gaussian state and can be written as a superposition of coherent states, but with

---------------

 specific coefficients and phases.

Wait, perhaps when the phase phi is such that the state becomes a squeezed state. Let's see. The

---------------

 given state is |psi> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N.

If

---------------

 phi is such that the coefficients lead to a squeezed state, then the state is Gaussian, making non-Gaussianity zero. But

---------------

 for phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5, is that the case?

I'm not sure. Let

---------------

 me think about the general form of a squeezed state. A squeezed vacuum state can be written as S(r) |0>, where S is the squeezing operator. The

---------------

 squeezing operator can be expressed in terms of exponentials of (a^2 and (a†)^2) operators.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 the state |psi> can be written as a squeezed state under certain conditions. But I'm not sure about the exact conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the state |psi> is a coherent

---------------

 state when phi is zero or pi/2. Let me see:

At phi=0, |psi> becomes |alpha> / sqrt(1 + 0) = |alpha>, which is a Gaussian state.

At phi=pi/2, |psi> becomes [0 + 1 * |-alpha> ] / N. N

---------------

 is sqrt(1 + sin(pi) exp(-2 alpha^2)) = sqrt(1 + 0) =1. So |psi> = |-alpha>, which is a Gaussian state.

So for phi=0 and phi=pi/2, the state is Gaussian. But for other phi values, it's a superposition of two different coherent states, leading to a non-Gaussian state.

In our case, phi is -pi/4, which is between 0 and pi/2, so the state is a superposition, hence

---------------

 non-Gaussian. So the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.

But according to the earlier calculation, del_b is zero because both rho and tau are pure. So perhaps

---------------

 the problem is considering the relative entropy differently. Maybe the formula is S(rho||tau), which would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference

---------------

 Gaussian state is not pure. Maybe it's a thermal state or a mixed Gaussian state. But without knowing which Gaussian state to use, I can't compute the exact entropy.

Wait, maybe the problem is

---------------

 designed so that the non-Gaussianity is zero. Perhaps because the state is a Gaussian state. But earlier, I thought that when

---------------

 phi is not 0 or pi/2, the state is non-Gaussian.

Wait, let's think about the state

---------------

 |psi> when phi is -pi/4.

The state is [ |alpha> - |-alpha> ] / N.

Wait

---------------

, if we expand this, perhaps it's a squeezed state.

Wait, perhaps the state can be rewritten as a squeezed state. Let's consider

---------------

 the case when alpha is real. The state |alpha> is a coherent state, and |-alpha> is another coherent state.

The

---------------

 state |psi> is (|alpha> - |-alpha>)/sqrt(2) when N is 1. But in

---------------

 our case, N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the state can be written as a squeezed state. Let me recall that a squeezed vacuum state can be written as S(r) |0>, where S(r) is the squeezing operator.

Alternatively, perhaps the

---------------

 state is a two-photon coherent state or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a coherent

---------------

 state under a different parameter. But I don't think so.

Another thought: perhaps the state is a cat state, which is known to be non-Gaussian. So the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero, so

---------------

 option D can't be correct.

But according to the problem statement, the relative entropy is calculated as S(rho) - S(tau). So if S(rho) is zero (because rho is pure) and S(tau) is zero (because tau is a pure Gaussian state), then del_b is zero, which

---------------

 would suggest option D.

But this seems contradictory. So perhaps I'm missing a key point here.

Wait, perhaps the problem

---------------

 is using a different reference Gaussian state. For example, the reference Gaussian state could be the maximally mixed state, which has maximum entropy. For

---------------

 a single mode, the maximum entropy Gaussian state is the thermal state with infinite temperature, which is the vacuum, but that's pure. So that doesn

---------------

't help.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the vacuum, but rho is a non-pure state. But in

---------------

 this case, rho is a pure state because it's a superposition, so S(rho)=0.

Wait, but

---------------

 wait. Let me compute N again. N is sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)).

At

---------------

 phi=-pi/4, 2 phi = -pi/2, so sin(-pi/2)=-1. alpha

---------------

=0.5, so exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-0.5)≈0.6065.

So N = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) ≈ sqrt(0.3935) ≈0.6275.

So |psi> is [ (

---------------

sqrt(2)/2)|0.5> - (sqrt(2)/2)|-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

But

---------------

 wait, perhaps the state can be written as a single coherent state. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a squeezed

---------------

 state. Because when you have a superposition of two coherent states, sometimes it can be expressed as a squeezed state.

Wait, for

---------------

 example, the squeezed vacuum state can be written as (|alpha> - | - alpha> ) / sqrt(2), but

---------------

 I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the state is a single-photon Fock state, which is non-Gaussian, but that's not the case here.

Wait

---------------

, perhaps the state can be expressed as a squeezed state. Let me think about the squeezing operator. The squeezing operator S(r) acts

---------------

 on the vacuum to produce a squeezed vacuum state. The squeezing parameter r can be complex, but for simplicity, let's consider real r.

The squeezed vacuum state S(r)|0> can be written as a superposition of even photon number states. But I

---------------

'm not sure if it can be written as a superposition of two coherent states.

Alternatively, perhaps the state |psi> is a squeezed

---------------

 state. If that's the case, then it would be Gaussian, making the non-Gaussianity zero.

But how can I check that?

Let

---------------

 me compute the Wigner function. The Wigner function of a coherent state is Gaussian. The Wigner function of a squeezed state is also Gaussian. But the Wigner function of a superposition of two coherent states is non-Gaussian. So if

---------------

 |psi> is a Gaussian state, it must have a Gaussian Wigner function.

But for the state given, it's a superposition of two coherent states, which should

---------------

 have a non-Gaussian Wigner function, implying that the state is non-Gaussian. Thus, the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.

But according to the calculation

---------------

 of del_b being zero, which would suggest option D is correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the relative entropy between

---------------

 the state and a reference Gaussian state, but the formula given is not the standard relative entropy. Perhaps it's the difference in the entropies, which

---------------

 would be zero if both are pure.

But that would imply that the non-Gaussianity is zero, which contradicts the expectation.

I

---------------

'm getting stuck here. Let me think of another approach. Perhaps I can compute the density matrix rho and see if it's Gaussian.

The state rho is |psi><psi|. The

---------------

 density matrix for a Gaussian state has a specific form. For a single mode, a Gaussian state can be represented by its first and second moments. If

---------------

 the state rho has a density matrix that can be written in terms of the number operator and displacement, then it's Gaussian.

But for

---------------

 a superposition of coherent states, the density matrix would involve cross terms between |alpha> and |-alpha>, which are non-Gaussian. So the state is non-Gaussian, implying

---------------

 that the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.

But according to the formula, del_b is zero. So perhaps the problem

---------------

 is designed such that the non-Gaussianity is zero. But that would mean that the state is Gaussian, which seems contradictory.

Alternatively, perhaps the state

---------------

 is Gaussian under these specific parameters. Maybe when phi is -pi/4 and alpha=0.5, the state becomes Gaussian.

Wait, but

---------------

 how? Let me think about the state.

|psi> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N.

Let

---------------

 me choose phi such that the state becomes a coherent state. For example, if phi=0, then |psi> = |alpha>, which is Gaussian. Similarly, phi=pi/2 would make |psi> = |-alpha>, which is Gaussian.

But for other phi values, it's a superposition, which

---------------

 is non-Gaussian. So for phi=-pi/4, the state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.

But according to the calculation

---------------

, del_b is zero. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the definition of non-Gaussianity here.

Wait, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is defined

---------------

 as the relative entropy between rho and the closest Gaussian state. If the state is already Gaussian, then the relative entropy would be zero. But if

---------------

 it's non-Gaussian, then it would be positive.

But in this problem, the formula given isn't the relative entropy between rho and tau, but the difference in their entropies.

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps the problem is using a different definition of non-Gaussianity. For example, the Hilbert-Schmidt distance to the set of Gaussian states. But the problem states

---------------

 it's using relative entropy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not correctly stated, and the non-Gaussianity is the relative entropy between rho and tau, which would be a

---------------

 positive quantity. But according to the formula given, it's the difference in entropies, which could be zero.

I

---------------

'm stuck. Let me look at the options again. The options are A) 2.48, B) 0.25, C) 1.38, D) 0.

If the state

---------------

 is non-Gaussian, the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero, so D) 0 is unlikely. But according

---------------

 to the earlier calculation, del_b is zero because both states are pure. So perhaps the correct answer is D) 0.

Wait, but that

---------------

 would mean that the state is Gaussian, which contradicts the intuition. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's answer is D) 0 because the state is a cat

---------------

 state, which is non-Gaussian, but the non-Gaussianity measure happens to be zero.

But I'm not sure

---------------

. I think I'll have to make an educated guess here. Since the state is a superposition, it's non-Gaussian, but according to the formula

---------------

, the non-Gaussianity is zero. So perhaps the answer is D) 0.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively

---------------

, maybe the problem is using a different reference state. If the reference Gaussian state is a maximally mixed Gaussian state, then S(tau) would be higher

---------------

 than zero, making del_b positive.

But without knowing the exact form of tau, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the problem

---------------

 expects me to realize that the state is Gaussian, leading to non-Gaussianity zero.

Wait, perhaps the state is a coherent

---------------

 state when phi is -pi/4. Let me compute N again.

N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*(-pi/4)) exp(-2*(0.5)^2)).

sin(-pi/2) = -1.

So N = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)) = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

But the

---------------

 state is [ cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Which

---------------

 is [ (sqrt(2)/2)|0.5> - (sqrt(2)/2)|-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Hmm

---------------

, perhaps this can be written as a single coherent state. Let me think: can a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha> be written as a single coherent state?

Wait

---------------

, |beta> = A [ |alpha> + e^{i theta} |-alpha> ].

If we choose theta and A appropriately, perhaps |

---------------

beta> can be a coherent state. But I'm not sure about the exact conditions.

Wait, for the state to be a coherent state, it must satisfy the relation a|beta> = beta |beta>, where a is the annihilation operator.

Let me see

---------------

 if this state satisfies that condition. Let's compute a |psi>.

a |psi> = [ cos(phi) a |alpha> + sin(phi) a |-alpha> ] / N.

We know that a |alpha> = (alpha) |alpha> +

---------------

 sqrt(alpha^2 -1) ??? Wait, no. Wait, the annihilation operator acting on a coherent state |alpha> gives alpha |alpha>.

So a |alpha> = alpha |alpha>, and a |-alpha> = (-alpha) |-alpha>.

So a |psi> = [ cos(phi) alpha |alpha> + sin(phi) (-alpha) |-alpha> ] / N.

Which

---------------

 is [ alpha cos(phi) |alpha> - alpha sin(phi) |-alpha> ] / N.

But |psi> is [ cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) |-alpha> ] / N.

So a |psi> = alpha [ cos(phi) |alpha> - sin(phi) |-alpha> ] / N.

Which

---------------

 is alpha [ (cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) |-alpha> ) - 2 sin(phi) |-alpha> ] / N.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 this can be written as alpha times a combination. Let me factor this out.

a |psi> = alpha [ cos(phi) |alpha> - sin(phi) |-alpha> ] / N.

But

---------------

 |psi> is [ cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) |-alpha> ] / N.

So unless alpha

---------------

 is zero or some other condition, a |psi> won't be equal to beta |psi>, meaning |psi> isn't a coherent state.

Thus, the state isn't a coherent state, implying it's non-Gaussian. So the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.

But according to the formula

---------------

 given, del_b is zero. So perhaps the problem is using a different definition, leading to the non-Gaussianity being zero.

I

---------------

'm stuck. I think I'll have to go with the calculation that del_b is zero, so the answer is D) 0.


The problem involves calculating the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is defined as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N},
\]
where \( \alpha \) is the amplitude, \( \phi \) is the phase, and \( N \) is the normalization constant given by:

\[
N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi) \exp(-2\alpha^2)}.
\]

The relative entropy measure is defined as:

\[
\Delta_b = \text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau),
\]
where \( \rho \) is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state \( |\psi\rangle \), and \( \tau \) is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Normalization Constant \( N \):**
   For \( \phi = -\pi/4 \) and \( \alpha = 0.5 \):
   \[
   \sin(2\phi) = \sin(-\pi/2) = -1, \quad \exp(-2\alpha^2) = \exp(-0.5) \approx 0.6065.
   \]
   Substituting into \( N \):
   \[
   N = \sqrt{1 + (-1)(0.6065)} = \sqrt{1 - 0.6065} = \sqrt{0.3935} \approx 0.6275.
   \]

2. **State \( |\psi\rangle \):**
   Substituting \( \phi = -\pi/4 \) and \( \alpha = 0.5 \):
   \[
   |\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(-\pi/4)|0.5\rangle + \sin(-\pi/4)|-0.5\rangle}{0.6275}.
   \]
   Using \( \cos(-\pi/4) = \sin(\pi/4) = \sqrt{2}/2 \approx 0.7071 \) and \( \sin(-\pi/4) = -\sqrt{2}/2 \approx -0.7071 \):
   \[
   |\psi\rangle = \frac{0.7071|0.5\rangle - 0.7071|-0.5\rangle}{0.6275}.
   \]

3. **Non-Gaussianity and Relative Entropy:**
   The state \( |\psi\rangle \) is a superposition of two coherent states \( |0.5\rangle \) and \( |-0.5\rangle \). Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superposition is generally non-Gaussian. However, the relative entropy measure \( \Delta_b \) is defined as the difference in von Neumann entropies:
   \[
   \Delta_b = S(\rho) - S(\tau),
   \]
   where \( S(\rho) = \text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) \) and \( S(\tau) = \text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau) \).

   - If \( \rho \) is a pure state (as it is for \( |\psi\rangle \)), \( S(\rho) = 0 \).
   - If \( \tau \) is a pure Gaussian state (e.g., a coherent state), \( S(\tau) = 0 \).

   Thus, \( \Delta_b = 0 - 0 = 0 \), implying no non-Gaussianity. This result aligns with the fact that the relative entropy measure as defined here does not capture the non-Gaussian nature of the state.

4. **Critical Evaluation of Options:**
   - **Option A (2.48):** This value is inconsistent with the calculation, as the relative entropy measure yields zero.
   - **Option B (0.25):** Similarly inconsistent with the calculation.
   - **Option C (1.38):** Also inconsistent with the calculation.
   - **Option D (0):** Matches the result of the calculation, where \( \Delta_b = 0 \).

### Conclusion:
The non-Gaussianity, as defined by the given relative entropy measure, is zero because both \( \rho \) and \( \tau \) are pure states, leading to \( S(\rho) = S(\tau) = 0 \). Thus, the correct answer is:
