Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator given a specific state. Alright, let's break

---------------

 it down.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable, like P_z, is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in the given state.

The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let

---------------

 me write that down. So, it's a three-component vector. And the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which makes

---------------

 sense because the matrix forms of P_x, P_y, and P_z are given in this basis.

Wait, the operator

---------------

 P_z is given as a diagonal matrix: the first row is (ħ, 0, 0), second (0,0,0), and third (0,0,-ħ). So P

---------------

_z is diagonal, which means its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors here. So the state provided is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. That should

---------------

 simplify things because in this basis, measuring P_z is straightforward.

But wait, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. Oh

---------------

, right, the state is given, so that's the state vector I have. So I don't need to worry about eigen

---------------

states of P_x unless I'm calculating expectation values for P_x, which I'm not. The question is about P_z's uncertainty.

So,

---------------

 to find ΔP_z, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩.

Wait, but the

---------------

 state is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Let me check

---------------

 if this is normalized. The sum of squares should be 1. Let's compute: ( (-1/2)^2 ) + ( (1/√2)^2 ) + ( (-1/2)^2 ) = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) = 1/2 plus 1/2 equals

---------------

 1. Oh, okay, it's normalized. Good, so I don't have to normalize it.

Now, let

---------------

's find ⟨P_z⟩. That's the expectation value of P_z in state |ψ⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, the expectation value is the sum of the diagonal

---------------

 elements multiplied by the respective probabilities (squares of the components of |ψ⟩).

Wait, another way: since P_z is diagonal, in

---------------

 the given basis, the expectation value is just the sum over the components of |ψ|^2 multiplied by the corresponding diagonal elements.

So,

---------------

 the components of |ψ⟩ are: ψ₁ = -1/2, ψ₂ = 1/√2, ψ₃ = -1/2.

The squares

---------------

 of these are |ψ₁|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4, |ψ₂|² = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2, |ψ₃|² = 1/4.

The

---------------

 diagonal elements of P_z are ħ, 0, -ħ.

So, ⟨P_z⟩ = |ψ₁|² * (ħ) + |ψ₂|² * 0 + |ψ₃|² * (-ħ) = (1/4)(ħ) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-ħ) = (ħ/4 - ħ/4) = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Wait

---------------

, that's interesting. So the expectation value is zero. Then ⟨P_z⟩ squared is zero.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? Since

---------------

 P_z squared is (P_z)^2, which would be the square of each diagonal element. So the matrix P_z squared would have elements (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2 on

---------------

 the diagonal, so it's (ħ², 0, ħ²).

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is the sum of |ψ_i|^2 multiplied by (P_z)

---------------

_{i,i}^2. Wait, no, P_z squared is just each diagonal element squared, so:

⟨P_z²⟩ = |ψ₁|² * (ħ)^2 + |ψ₂|² * 0 + |ψ₃|² * (ħ)^2.

Wait

---------------

, because (P_z squared) is diagonal with entries (ħ^2, 0, ħ^2).

So substit

---------------

uting the values:

⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/4) * ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4) * ħ² = (ħ²/4 + ħ²/4) = ħ²/2.

So now, ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) = sqrt( (ħ²/2) - 0 ) = sqrt(ħ²/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, that's one of the options. Let me look at

---------------

 the choices. Option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which matches.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check.

---------------

 Because I've heard that when the expectation value is zero, the uncertainty is just the square root of the expectation of the square. So

---------------

 that seems right.

So the uncertainty ΔP_z is ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.
</think>

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The operator $P_z$ is diagonal in the given basis, with diagonal elements $(\hbar, 0, -\hbar)$. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = | \psi_1 |^2 \cdot \hbar + | \psi_2 |^2 \cdot 0 + | \psi_3 |^2 \cdot (-\hbar),
\]

where $| \psi_1 |^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4$, $| \psi_2 |^2 = (1/\sqrt{2})^2 = 1/2$, and $| \psi_3 |^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4$. Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

Thus, $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$.

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is also diagonal, with diagonal elements $(\hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2)$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = | \psi_1 |^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + | \psi_2 |^2 \cdot 0 + | \psi_3 |^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \hbar^2 / 2$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\hbar / \sqrt{2}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
