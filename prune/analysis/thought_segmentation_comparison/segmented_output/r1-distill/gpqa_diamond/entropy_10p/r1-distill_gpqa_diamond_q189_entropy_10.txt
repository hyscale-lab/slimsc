Okay, so I've got this question about nucleophilicity in aqueous solution. I remember that nucleophilicity can depend on a few factors like the solvent, the charge, and the structure of the molecule. Let me think through this step by step.

The question asks me to arrange the given nucleophiles from the most reactive to the least reactive in aqueous solution. The options are 

---------------

1 to 5, and the choices are A to D.

First, let me list out the nucleophiles:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate:

---------------

 That's an alkoxide ion, right? It's the conjugate base of 4-methylcyclohexanol. Alkoxides are strong bases and good nucleophiles, especially in polar aprotic solvents. But wait, the solvent here is aqueous, which is polar protic. In polar protic solvents, larger

---------------

, bulkier ions are less solvated, making them better nucleophiles. So the cyclohexanolate would

---------------

 have some bulk, but I'm not sure how that ranks.

2. Hydroxide: OH⁻. This is a strong nucleophile, but in aqueous solution, it's the

---------------

 conjugate base of water. In polar protic solvents, the OH⁻ is solvated by water molecules, which reduces

---------------

 its nucleophilicity. So OH⁻ is a good nucleophile but maybe not the best in water.

3. Propionate: That's CH₂CH₂COO⁻. It

---------------

's the conjugate base of propionic acid. Since it's a carboxylate, it's a weaker base than alkoxides because the negative charge is delocalized over two oxygen atoms. So prop

---------------

ionate should be less nucleophilic than hydroxide and cyclohexanolate.

4. Methanol: CH3OH. Meth

---------------

anol is a neutral molecule and a poor nucleophile because it's not deprotonated. It's more of a nucleophile when deprotonated as methoxide, but in aqueous solution, it

---------------

's just a weak acid (I think pKa around 19), so not very ionized. So methanol would

---------------

 be a poor nucleophile here.

5. Ethanethiolate: That's the thiolate ion, S⁻. Thiolate ions are stronger nucleophiles than the corresponding hydroxide ions because sulfur is less electronegative than oxygen and holds onto the negative charge less tightly. So

---------------

 in aqueous solution, the thiolate should be a better nucleophile than hydroxide because it's less solvated or

---------------

 something? Wait, but wait—solvation can affect this. In polar protic solvents, larger ions are less solvated. S

---------------

ulfur is bigger, so maybe the thiolate is less solvated than hydroxide. That would make it a stronger nucleophile.

Wait, I

---------------

'm a bit confused about the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution. I remember that in polar aprotic solvents, nucleophilicity tends

---------------

 to follow basicity because solvation isn't as strong. But in polar protic solvents like water, the more polarizable and less solvated ions are better nucleophiles.

So in

---------------

 aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity is usually: thiolate (RS⁻) > alkoxide (RO⁻) > other

---------------

 weak bases. But wait, let me think about the exact order for the given options.

Looking at the options:

5. Ethanethiolate (RS⁻) should

---------------

 be the strongest nucleophile here because S is less electronegative, so the thiolate is a better nucleophile than hydroxide. So

---------------

 5 is first.

Next is 2. Hydroxide (OH⁻). But wait, another possibility is the cyclohexanolate (1). But

---------------

 the cyclohexanolate is an alkoxide, same as OH⁻. But the structure matters. The 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a bulky base. Bulky bases are less

---------------

 nucleophilic in SN2 reactions because of steric hindrance, but in terms of basicity, perhaps not. But in aque

---------------

ous solution, the solvent is H2O. So maybe the less bulky alkoxide would be more nucleophilic. Wait, but

---------------

 the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than hydroxide? Because bulky bases are weaker bases due to less solvation.

---------------

 Wait, no—bulky groups make the base less accessible, so they are weaker bases. For example, tert-butoxide is a weaker base than hydroxide because it's bulk

---------------

ier and less solvated. Wait, but in aqueous solution, the strength of the base is determined by how well it's solvated. So,

---------------

 the more solvated, the weaker the base. So, the 4-methylcyclohexanolate might be a weaker base than hydroxide because it's bulk

---------------

ier, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should compare the pKa of their conjugate acids. The lower

---------------

 the pKa, the stronger the acid, so the weaker the conjugate base. For cyclohexanol, the pKa is around 16-18. Water has a pKa of about 15.7. So,

---------------

 cyclohexanol is a weaker acid than water. That means the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than hydroxide. So

---------------

, the cyclohexanolate (1) is a stronger base than OH⁻ (2).

But in aqueous solution, the

---------------

 strength of the base (how well it can deprotonate) doesn't directly translate to nucleophilicity because of solvation. Strong

---------------

er bases are often better nucleophiles in aprotic solvents, but in protic solvents, it's more about how well they're solvated. So

---------------

, a stronger base like the cyclohexanolate is less solvated than hydroxide because it's bulkier. Wait, no

---------------

, bulky bases are less solvated because the solvent can't get in as easily. So, if the cyclohexanolate is bulkier, it's less solvated, making it a better nucleophile than OH⁻.



---------------

Wait, but in water, the OH⁻ is highly solvated. So, in terms of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution, the

---------------

 order is typically: RS⁻ > RO⁻ (alkoxides) > others. So, if 5 is ethanethiolate, that

---------------

's the strongest. Then comes the cyclohexanolate (1) as a stronger base and less solvated than OH⁻. Or

---------------

 wait, maybe the cyclohexanolate is less solvated than OH⁻, making it a better nucleophile.



---------------

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to outline the factors:

Nucleophilicity in aqueous solution (polar protic):

1. Polar

---------------

izable ions (like S⁻) are better nucleophiles because they're less solvated. So thiolate (5) is the

---------------

 strongest.

2. Then come the alkoxides (like 1 and 2). Which is stronger between 1 and 2? Well

---------------

, the cyclohexanolate is an alkoxide, so same as OH⁻, but is it a stronger base?

The

---------------

 pKa of cyclohexanol is around 16, while water is ~15.7. So cyclohexanol is a weaker acid than water, meaning cyclohexanolate (1) is a stronger base than OH⁻. But

---------------

 in terms of solvation, the cyclohexanolate is bulkier than OH⁻. In aqueous solution, the

---------------

 more bulky the ion, the less solvated it is. So, the cyclohexanolate would be a better nucleophile than OH⁻ because

---------------

 it's less solvated. Wait, but OH⁻ is more solvated, so its nucleophilicity is lower.

So the

---------------

 order would be: 5 (ethanethiolate) > 1 (cyclohexanolate) > 2 (OH⁻) ?

Wait, but I

---------------

'm not so sure. Because I've heard that in aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity is: RS⁻ > RO⁻ (alk

---------------

oxides) > HO⁻ > others.

Wait, but I think that's in a different solvent. Let me think again

---------------

. In polar protic solvents, the order of nucleophilicity is usually: I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻ (but

---------------

 these are halides). For oxygen and sulfur nucleophiles, thiolates are better because they're less electronegative and more

---------------

 polarizable.

So, putting it all together:

Nucleophilicity order (most to least) in aqueous solution:

5. Ethanethiolate (RS⁻) →

---------------

 strongest.

Then, between 1 (cyclohexanolate) and 2 (OH⁻): cyclohexanolate is a stronger base because

---------------

 its conjugate acid (cyclohexanol, pKa ~16) is weaker than water (pKa ~15.7). So the

---------------

 cyclohexanolate is a stronger base, meaning it's a better nucleophile in aprotic solvents. But in aqueous solution, it

---------------

's less solvated because it's bulkier, making it a better nucleophile than OH⁻, which is more solvated.

So,

---------------

 5 > 1 > 2.

Then comes 3. Propionate (CH2CH2COO⁻). Since

---------------

 it's a carboxylate, which is a weaker base than alkoxides. So propionate is less nucleophilic than OH

---------------

⁻ and cyclohexanolate.

Then comes 4. Methanol (CH3OH), which is a neutral molecule and a poor nucleophile compared

---------------

 to the deprotonated ones.

Wait, but wait, methanol is neutral. So its nucleophilicity is low

---------------

 because it's not charged. So the order would be:

5 (ethanethiolate) > 1 (cyclohexanolate) > 2 (OH⁻) > 3 (propionate) > 4 (methanol).

Wait, but I

---------------

'm not sure about the order between 1 and 2. Because if the cyclohexanolate is bulkier, it

---------------

's less solvated, making it a better nucleophile than OH⁻. So 1 comes before 2.

So

---------------

 the order is 5,1,2,3,4.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option D is 5,2,1,3,4. That's 5 first, then 2, then 1, then 3, then 4. That

---------------

 doesn't fit my conclusion.

Option A: 5,2,3,1,4 → No, because 1 should come before 2.

Option B: 2,5,1,4,3 → No, 

---------------

5 is first.

Option D: 5,2,1,3,4 → No, because 1 should be before 2.

Hmm, none

---------------

 of the options seem to match that order. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the order between 1 and 2.

Alternatively, perhaps in aqueous solution, the hydro

---------------

xide (2) is more nucleophilic than the cyclohexanolate (1) because OH⁻ is a stronger base and

---------------

 despite being more solvated. Or wait, maybe the cyclohexanolate is less solvated because it's bulkier, making it a better nucleophile than OH⁻.

Wait, but

---------------

 in aqueous solution, the hydroxide is more available because the cyclohexanolate is less so? No, I

---------------

'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is 5 (ethanethiolate) is first. Then comes hydroxide (2), because in

---------------

 some cases, OH⁻ is a stronger nucleophile than other alkoxides. Wait, no, because the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than

---------------

 OH⁻, so in a polar aprotic solvent, it would be more nucleophilic. But in a polar protic solvent, sol

---------------

vation matters more. So maybe the more solvated the base, the less nucleophilic it is.

Wait, the

---------------

 cyclohexanolate is less solvated than OH⁻ because it's bulkier, so it's a better nucleophile. So the

---------------

 order after 5 would be 1, then 2, then 3, then 4.

So the order is 5 >1 >2 >3 >4.

Looking at the options, none

---------------

 seem to match this. Let me check the options again.

Option A: 5,2,3,1,4 → No.

Option B: 2,5,1,4,3 → No.

Option D: 5,2,1,3,4 → So

---------------

 5 first, then 2, then 1, then 3, then 4.

Wait, that's not

---------------

 matching what I thought. So in option D, the order after 5 is 2 (OH⁻) before 1 (cyclohexanolate). But according to what I thought, 1 should be before 2.

So

---------------

 perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe in aqueous solution, the hydroxide is more nucleophilic than the cyclohexanolate.

Wait

---------------

, I need to think about the strength of the base. Cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than hydroxide because the pKa of cyclohexanol is higher than that of water. So,

---------------

 in a polar aprotic solvent, the cyclohexanolate would be a better nucleophile than hydroxide. But in a polar protic solvent like water, sol

---------------

vation effects dominate. So which is more important?

In aqueous solution, the more basic the ion, the more it's solvated. Wait, no

---------------

, stronger bases are more stabilized by solvation. Wait, stronger bases (like RO⁻) are more solvated because

---------------

 they can better stabilize the solvent (H2O) by accepting protons. So, the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, so it's more solvated. Wait

---------------

, that can't be right. Wait, no, actually, stronger bases are less solvated because they're more willing

---------------

 to accept protons from the solvent. Wait, I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, in a polar protic solvent, the strength

---------------

 of the base is inversely related to solvation. Stronger bases are less solvated because they can more easily accept

---------------

 a proton from the solvent. So, if the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, it would be less solvated, making it a better nucleophile. So

---------------

 in aqueous solution, the cyclohexanolate would be a better nucleophile than OH⁻.

So the order is

---------------

 5 (ethanethiolate) >1 (cyclohexanolate) >2 (OH⁻) >3 (propionate) >4 (methanol).

Looking at the options again:

Option A: 5,2,3,1,4 → No.

Option D: 5,2,1,3,4 → No, because 1 should be after 5 but before 2.

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 I made a mistake. Maybe in aqueous solution, the hydroxide is a better nucleophile than the cyclohexanolate. Because

---------------

 the cyclohexanolate is less available due to being a stronger base and more solvated.

Wait, maybe I

---------------

'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. In a polar protic solvent, the nucleophilicity is inversely related to the ability

---------------

 to stabilize the charge (i.e., more stabilized → less nucleophilic). So, the more stabilized (more solvated) the ion, the less nucleophilic it is.

The

---------------

 cyclohexanolate ion is a stronger base than OH⁻, so it's less stabilized (because it's a stronger base,

---------------

 meaning it holds the negative charge less tightly, making it more willing to accept a proton). So, the cyclohexanolate is less solvated than OH⁻. Thus

---------------

, it's a better nucleophile than OH⁻.

So the order is 5 >1 >2 >3 >4.

But looking at the options, none have that order. So

---------------

 perhaps the correct order is 5, then 1, then 2, then 3, then 4.

Wait

---------------

, looking back at the options:

Option D: 5,2,1,3,4 → So 5, then 2, then 1, then 3, then 4.

Hmm

---------------

, but according to my analysis, 1 comes before 2. So none of the options match, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the order

---------------

 is 5, then 2, then 1, then 3, then 4.

Wait, another possibility: maybe

---------------

 the cyclohexanolate is more bulky, so in SN2 reactions, it's worse, but in terms of nucle

---------------

ophilicity in substitution, maybe it's better because it's less solvated.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is 5,2,1,3,4,

---------------

 which is option D.

But according to the analysis, 1 should come before 2. So perhaps the options don't have that,

---------------

 but maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the actual pKa values. Let me recall:

-

---------------

 Ethanethiol (HSCH2CH3) has a pKa around 10.

- Water has a pKa of ~15.7.

Wait, no, wait: wait

---------------

, no, wait. Wait, the pKa of H2S is around 7, and the pKa of the second dissociation is around 19. But eth

---------------

anethiol (CH3CH2SH) has a pKa around 10.

So, the thiolate ion (RS⁻) is a stronger base than hydroxide (pKa of conjugate acid is

---------------

 ~10 for ethanethiol, vs ~15.7 for water). So RS⁻ is a stronger base than OH⁻.

In aqueous solution, stronger

---------------

 bases are less solvated, so RS⁻ is less solvated than OH⁻, making it a better nucleophile.

So,

---------------

 the order is 5 (RS⁻) first.

Then comes the cyclohexanolate (1), which is a stronger base than OH⁻ (2), so it

---------------

's less solvated, making it a better nucleophile than OH⁻.

So, after 5 comes 1, then 2.

Wait, but the

---------------

 cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, so in a polar protic solvent, it's less solvated, making it a better nucleophile than OH⁻.

So, order is

---------------

 5 >1 >2 >3 >4.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D: 5,2,1,3,4. But that would

---------------

 put 2 before 1, which contradicts what I thought.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the strength

---------------

 of the base. Let me check the pKa of cyclohexanol. I think it's around 16-18. So, the

---------------

 conjugate acid of cyclohexanolate is pKa ~16, which is weaker than water (pKa ~15.7). So, the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻.

So

---------------

 in aqueous solution, the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base, so it's less solvated than OH⁻, making it a better nucleophile.

So, the

---------------

 order is 5 (ethanethiolate) >1 (cyclohexanolate) >2 (OH⁻) >3 (propionate) >4 (methanol).

Looking at the options, none

---------------

 have this exact order. So perhaps I need to reevaluate.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option D is 5,2,1,3,4.

Which

---------------

 would be 5 first, then 2 (OH⁻), then 1 (cyclohexanolate), then 3, then 4.

But according to my analysis, 1 should be before 2. So perhaps

---------------

 the correct order isn't in the options, but that can't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the order between 1 and 2. Maybe in aqueous solution, the hydroxide is a better nucleophile than the cyclohexanolate.

Wait

---------------

, because the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base, but in a polar protic solvent, the solvent can stabilize the charge

---------------

 better. So, perhaps the hydroxide is more solvated, making it a weaker nucleophile than the cyclohexanolate.

Wait

---------------

, but in polar protic solvents, the less solvated (more polarizable) ions are better nucleophiles. So, if

---------------

 the cyclohexanolate is less solvated, it's a better nucleophile than OH⁻.

So the order should

---------------

 be 5 >1 >2 >3 >4.

Looking at the options, perhaps none match. Wait, perhaps I should

---------------

 look for an option that starts with 5, followed by 1, then 2, etc. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made

---------------

 a mistake and the order is 5, then 2, then 1, then 3, then 4. That

---------------

 would be option D.

But why would 2 come before 1? Because in aqueous solution, OH⁻ is more nucleophilic than the cyclohexanolate.

Wait

---------------

, perhaps the cyclohexanolate is more hindered, making it a worse nucleophile despite being a stronger base.

Ah

---------------

, steric hindrance! The cyclohexanolate is a bulky ion. In SN2 reactions, bulky nucleophiles are less effective because of steric hindrance. But in terms of simple

---------------

 nucleophilicity in solution, perhaps the bulk makes the ion less effective.

Wait, but in solution, the steric factors might

---------------

 affect how well the nucleophile can attack, but in terms of basicity and solvation, perhaps the cyclohexanolate is a better nucleophile.

But

---------------

 considering steric hindrance, perhaps the hydroxide (2) is a better nucleophile than the bulky cyclohexanolate (1). So the order would be 5 >2 >1 >3 >4.

That

---------------

 would match option D: 5,2,1,3,4.

So the order would be option D: 5,2,1,3,4.

I

---------------

 think that's the correct order. So the answer is option D.


To determine the nucleophilicity of the given species in aqueous solution, we analyze their basicity, solvation effects, and steric hindrance. In polar protic solvents like water, nucleophilicity is influenced by how well the nucleophile is solvated. Stronger bases are less solvated and tend to be better nucleophiles. Additionally, steric hindrance can reduce the effectiveness of bulky nucleophiles in certain reactions.

### Analysis of the Nucleophiles:
1. **4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1)**: This is an alkoxide ion, a strong base due to its conjugate acid (cyclohexanol) having a pKa of ~16. However, it is bulky, which can reduce its nucleophilicity in reactions involving steric hindrance. Despite this, it is less solvated than hydroxide due to its bulkiness, making it a better nucleophile than OH⁻ in aqueous solution.

2. **Hydroxide (2)**: OH⁻ is a strong base with a pKa of ~15.7 for water. It is highly solvated in aqueous solution, which reduces its nucleophilicity compared to less solvated species like the thiolate ion. However, it is less bulky than the cyclohexanolate, making it a better nucleophile than the cyclohexanolate in some cases.

3. **Propionate (3)**: As a carboxylate ion, it is weaker in basicity compared to alkoxides and thiolates. Its negative charge is delocalized over two oxygen atoms, reducing its nucleophilicity. It is less reactive than hydroxide and cyclohexanolate.

4. **Methanol (4)**: A neutral molecule, methanol is a poor nucleophile compared to deprotonated species like alkoxides and thiolates. Its nucleophilicity is much

---------------

 lower in aqueous solution.

5. **Ethanethiolate (5)**: The thiolate ion (RS⁻) is highly nucleophilic due to sulfur's lower electronegativity and greater polarizability compared to oxygen. It is less solvated than hydroxide, making it the strongest nucleophile in this list.

### Order of Nucleophilicity:
- **Ethanethiolate (5)** is the strongest nucleophile due to its polarizability and reduced solvation.
- **Hydroxide (2)** follows, as it is less solvated than propionate and methanol but more solvated than the cyclohexanolate.
- **4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1)** comes next, as it is less bulky than hydroxide but still highly nucleophilic.
- **Propionate (3)** is weaker due to its delocalized charge.
- **Methanol (4)** is the poorest nucleophile as it is neutral.

### Correct Option:
The correct order is **5 > 2 > 1 > 3 > 4**, which matches **Option D**.
