Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find the product of AB and AC in triangle ABC. The problem states that the circumcenter is O, the incenter is I, and IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. Hmm, okay

---------------

, let me break this down.

First, I remember that in a triangle, the circumradius R is related to the sides of

---------------

 the triangle and the area. The formula I know is that the area Δ can be expressed as (a*b*c)/(4R), where a, b, c are the sides.

---------------

 Since R is 13, maybe that will come into play later.

The inradius r is 6, and I know

---------------

 another formula that relates the area to the inradius: Δ = r*s, where s is the semi-perimeter. So if

---------------

 I can find s, or somehow relate it to other variables, that might help.

But the key condition here is that IA is perpendicular to OI. IA

---------------

 is the inradius direction from I to A, and OI is the line connecting the incenter to the circumcenter. So

---------------

, these two lines are perpendicular. I wonder what that implies about the triangle.

I recall that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula OI² = R(R - 2r). Let me verify

---------------

 that: OI² = R² - 2Rr. Yeah, that's the formula. So, plugging in R=13 and r=6, OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI = sqrt(13). Interesting

---------------

.

Wait, but in this case, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, triangle IOA is a right triangle with legs IA and OI, and hypotenuse OA. Since

---------------

 OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So, OA = 13, OI = sqrt(13), IA is the inradius,

---------------

 which is 6? Wait, no, IA isn't the inradius. The inradius is the distance from I to any side, but IA is the distance from I to vertex A. So

---------------

, IA isn't 6; that's a mistake.

So, I need to find the length of IA, which is the distance from the incenter to vertex A. I

---------------

 remember that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be found using the formula IA = sqrt(r² + (s - a)²), where s is the semi-perimeter and a is the side opposite vertex A. Let

---------------

 me make sure that's correct. Alternatively, there's another formula: IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)). Hmm

---------------

, which one is it?

Wait, I think it's IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)). Let me see

---------------

. The inradius is related to the angles as well. So, if I can find angle A, then I can find IA.

But how

---------------

 does the condition IA perpendicular to OI help? Since IA is perpendicular to OI, the triangle IOA is right-angled at I. So, by

---------------

 the Pythagorean theorem, OA² = OI² + IA².

We know OA is 13, OI is sqrt(13), so pl

---------------

ugging in:

13² = (sqrt(13))² + IA²
169 = 13 + IA²
IA² = 156
IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39)

Okay

---------------

, so IA is 2*sqrt(39). Now, using the formula IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)), we

---------------

 can write:

2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2)
sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = (3*sqrt(39)) / 39 = sqrt(39)/13

Wait, let

---------------

 me compute that again. 6 divided by 2*sqrt(39) is 3/sqrt(39). Rationalizing the denominator: 3*sqrt(39)/39 = sqrt(39)/13. So, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.

Now

---------------

, I can find cos(A/2) using the identity sin²θ + cos²θ = 1.

So, cos²(A/2) = 1 - (39/169) = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169 =

---------------

 10*13/(13²) = 10/13. So, cos(A/2) = sqrt(10/13).

Now

---------------

, I need to find AB * AC. Let me denote AB = c, AC = b, and BC = a. So

---------------

, I'm to find b*c.

I know that in a triangle, the product b*c can be related to the area and the sine

---------------

 of the included angle. Since angle A is between sides b and c, the area Δ can be expressed as (1/2)*b*c*sin A. Also

---------------

, from the inradius formula, Δ = r*s, where s = (a + b + c)/2.

But

---------------

 I also know that the area can be expressed using the circumradius as Δ = (a*b*c)/(4R). Hmm

---------------

, but that involves all three sides, which I don't know yet.

Wait, perhaps I can express b*c in terms of other variables. Let

---------------

 me think.

From the Law of Sines, a = 2R sin A, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C. So, b

---------------

*c = (2R)^2 sin B sin C.

But that might not be directly helpful unless I can relate angles B and C somehow

---------------

.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for the product of two sides in terms of the semi-perimeter and other variables.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I can find angle A first. Since I have sin(A/2) and cos(A/2), I can find sin A and cos A.

Using

---------------

 double angle formulas:

sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(10)/sqrt(13)).



---------------

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13, and

---------------

 cos(A/2) = sqrt(10/13) = sqrt(130)/13.

So, sin A = 2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13) = 2*sqrt(39*130)/(13^2).

Compute

---------------

 39*130: 39*100=3900, 39*30=1170, total 5070.

So, sqrt(5070) = sqrt(5070). Hmm, 

---------------

5070 factors into 10*507, and 507 is 13*39, which is 13*13*3. So, sqrt(5070) = sqrt(10*13^2*3) = 13*sqrt(30).

So, sin A = 2*(13*sqrt(30))/(13^2) ) = 2*sqrt(30)/13.

So

---------------

, sin A = 2*sqrt(30)/13.

Now, the area Δ can be expressed as (1/2)*b*c*sin A.

---------------

 Also, Δ = r*s, where r=6 and s=(a + b + c)/2.

So, (

---------------

1/2)*b*c*(2*sqrt(30)/13) = 6*s.

Simplify:

---------------

 (b*c * sqrt(30))/13 = 6*s.

So, (b*c) = (6*s *13)/sqrt(30) = (78 s)/sqrt(30).

Hmm

---------------

, but I don't know s yet. So, perhaps I can find s another way.

Alternatively, I can express b

---------------

*c in terms of the area and sin A.

Wait, another approach: Since I know OI and IA, and they

---------------

 are perpendicular, perhaps I can find some relation between the sides.

Wait, let me think about coordinates. Maybe placing the triangle in a coordinate system would

---------------

 help. Let me try that.

Let me place point O at the origin (0,0). Then, point I is somewhere in

---------------

 the plane. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, and O is the circumcenter, perhaps I can assign coordinates to I

---------------

 such that this condition holds.

Let me denote point I as (h, k). Then, vector OI is (h, k). Vector IA is from

---------------

 I to A. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, their dot product is zero.

But wait, point A is on the circumcircle, so OA = 13. Let

---------------

 me denote point A as (x, y). Then, OA vector is (x, y), with magnitude 13.

Vector

---------------

 IA is (x - h, y - k). Vector OI is (h, k). Their dot product is zero: h*(x - h) + k*(y - k) = 0.

So

---------------

, h x + k y - (h² + k²) = 0.

But since point A is on the circumcircle, x² + y² = 13² = 169.

Hmm

---------------

, not sure if this is the best approach. Maybe it's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate the sides

---------------

 using trigonometric identities and the information I have.

I know that in a triangle, the inradius r = (Δ)/s, and the circumradius R = (a b c)/(4Δ). So

---------------

, maybe I can find expressions for a, b, c.

Wait, but I don't know the individual sides. Alternatively

---------------

, I can use the formula that relates R, r, and the distance between O and I, which I've already used.



---------------

Wait, another idea: The formula for the length of the inradius IA is sqrt(r^2 + (s - a)^2). So

---------------

, IA = sqrt(r² + (s - a)^2). Earlier, I found IA = 2*sqrt(39). So,

2*sqrt(39) = sqrt(6² + (s - a)^2)
S

---------------

quaring both sides: 4*39 = 36 + (s - a)^2
156 = 36 + (s - a)^2
(s - a)^2 = 120
s - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30)

So, s = a + 2*sqrt(30).

Hmm

---------------

, that's an equation relating s and a.

Now, I know that s = (a + b + c)/2, so:



---------------

(a + b + c)/2 = a + 2*sqrt(30)
Multiply both sides by 2: a + b + c = 2a + 4*sqrt(30)
Sub

---------------

tract a: b + c = a + 4*sqrt(30)
So, b + c = a + 4*sqrt(30)



---------------

Now, I have that.

Also, I know from the Law of Sines that a = 2R sin A = 2*13*sin A.

Earlier

---------------

, I found sin A = 2*sqrt(30)/13, so:

a = 26*(2*sqrt(30)/13) = 26*(2 sqrt

---------------

(30))/13 = 2*2*sqrt(30) = 4 sqrt(30)

So, a = 4 sqrt(30).

Wait

---------------

, that's a useful piece of information. So, side BC is 4 sqrt(30).

Now, from earlier, b + c = a + 4*sqrt(30) = 4 sqrt(30) + 4 sqrt(30) = 8 sqrt(30)

So, b + c = 8 sqrt(30)

Also

---------------

, from the Law of Cosines, I can relate the sides. But I need more information.

Wait, maybe I can find

---------------

 the semi-perimeter s.

From earlier, s = a + 2 sqrt(30) = 4 sqrt(30) + 2 sqrt(30) = 6 sqrt(30)

So, s = 6 sqrt(30)

Then

---------------

, the area Δ = r * s = 6 * 6 sqrt(30) = 36 sqrt(30)

Alternatively

---------------

, from the other area formula: Δ = (1/2)*b*c*sin A

We have Δ = 36 sqrt(30), sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13.

So,

36 sqrt(30) = (1/2)*b*c*(2 sqrt(30)/13)
Simplify:

---------------

 36 sqrt(30) = (b*c * sqrt(30))/13

Multiply both sides by 13:

36*13 sqrt(30) = b*c sqrt(30)

Divide both sides by sqrt(30):

36*13 = b*c

So, b*c = 36*13 = 468

Wait

---------------

, so AB * AC = c * b = 468

So, the answer is 468.

Wait

---------------

, that seems straightforward. Let me recap to ensure I didn't skip any steps.

1. Calculated OI using OI² = R(R - 2r) = 13*(

---------------

13 - 12) = 13. So, OI = sqrt(13).

2. Since IA perpendicular to OI, triangle IOA is right-angled at

---------------

 I, so OA² = OI² + IA².

3. OA is 13, so 169 = 13 + IA² =>

---------------

 IA² = 156 => IA = 2 sqrt(39).

4. IA formula: IA = sqrt(r² + (s - a)^2). Plugged in IA

---------------

 = 2 sqrt(39), r=6, solved for s - a = 2 sqrt(30). Thus, s = a + 2 sqrt(30).

5. From

---------------

 semi-perimeter, s = (a + b + c)/2. Plugged in and found that b + c = a + 4 sqrt(30).

6. From

---------------

 Law of Sines, a = 2R sin A. Found sin A using IA = r / sin(A/2),

---------------

 which gave sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13, then sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13.

7. Calcul

---------------

ated a = 4 sqrt(30).

8. Then, s = a + 2 sqrt(30) = 6 sqrt(30).

9. Calcul

---------------

ated area Δ = r*s = 36 sqrt(30).

10. Also, Δ = (1/2)*b*c*sin A. Plugged in known

---------------

 values and solved for b*c = 468.

Seems solid. I don't see any mistakes in the steps.


To solve the problem, we start by noting that the circumradius \( R = 13 \) and the inradius \( r = 6 \). The condition \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \) implies that triangle \( IOA \) is right-angled at \( I \). Using the formula for the distance between the incenter and circumcenter, we find \( OI = \sqrt{R(R - 2r)} = \sqrt{13} \). 



---------------

Applying the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \( IOA \), we have:
\[
OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2 \implies 13^2 = (\sqrt{13})^2 + IA^2 \implies IA^2 = 156 \implies IA = 2\sqrt{39}.
\]

Using the formula \( IA = \frac{r}{\sin(A/2)} \), we find:
\[
\sin(A/2) = \frac{6}{2\sqrt{39}} = \frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}.
\]
From the double-angle identity, we calculate:
\[
\sin A = 2 \sin(A/2) \cos(A/2) = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{39}}{13} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{10}{13}} = \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13}.
\]

The semi-perimeter \( s \) is found using \( IA = \sqrt{r^2 + (s - a)^2} \), leading to \( s - a = 2\sqrt{30} \) and \( s = a + 2\sqrt{30} \). Using the Law of Sines, \( a = 2R \sin A = 4\sqrt{30} \). Thus, \( s = 6\sqrt{30} \).

The area \( \Delta \) of the triangle is given by \( \Delta = r \cdot s = 36\sqrt{30} \). Using the area formula \( \Delta = \frac{1}{2}bc \sin A \), we solve for \( bc \):
\[
36\sqrt{30} = \frac{1}{2} bc \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13} \implies bc = 468.
\]

Thus, the product \( AB \cdot AC = 468 \).

\[
\boxed{468}
