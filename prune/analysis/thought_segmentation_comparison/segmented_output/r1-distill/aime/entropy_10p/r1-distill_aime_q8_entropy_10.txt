Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the product xy, given that both x and y are real numbers greater than 1. The problem

---------------

 states that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^(4y) also equals 10. Hmm, let

---------------

's try to unpack this step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but maybe if I convert them into exponential form, it might

---------------

 become clearer. Let me write down the two equations:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

Starting

---------------

 with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the logarithm power rule, I can bring the exponent x

---------------

 down. The power rule says that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So applying that here, the

---------------

 equation becomes:

x * log_x(y) = 10.

Wait, but log_x(y) is the logarithm of y with base x. Let

---------------

 me denote log_x(y) as some variable to make it easier. Let's say log_x(y) = a. Then the first equation becomes:

x * a = 10.



---------------

So from here, I can express a as 10/x.

But since a is log_x(y), that means y = x^a. Substituting a,

---------------

 we get y = x^(10/x).

Hmm, okay, so that's one relationship between x and y. Now let's look at the second equation:

---------------

 log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

Again, I'll apply the power rule here. So this becomes:

4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Let

---------------

 me denote log_y(x) as another variable, say b. So the equation becomes:

4y * b = 10.

Which

---------------

 simplifies to b = 10/(4y) = 5/(2y).

But since b is log_y(x), that means x = y^b. Substituting b, we get x = y^(5/(2y)).

Wait

---------------

, so now I have expressions for both x and y in terms of each other. From the first equation, y = x^(10/x), and from the second equation, x = y^(5/(2y)).

This

---------------

 seems like a system of equations where each variable is expressed in terms of the other. Maybe I can substitute one into the other.

Let me substitute y from the first equation into the second. So,

---------------

 x = (x^(10/x))^(5/(2y)).

Wait, but y is x^(10/x), so let

---------------

 me write that in. So substituting, we get:

x = [x^(10/x)]^(5/(2 * x^(10/x))).

Hmm

---------------

, that looks complicated, but let's try to simplify it. Let's take the exponents step by step.

First, [

---------------

x^(10/x)] is the base, and the exponent is 5/(2 * x^(10/x)).

So the

---------------

 entire right-hand side is x^{(10/x) * [5/(2 * x^(10/x))]}.

Let

---------------

 me compute the exponent:

(10/x) * [5/(2 * x^(10/x))] = (10 * 5) / (x * 2 * x^(10/x)) )

---------------

 = 50/(2x^{1 + (10/x)}).

Wait, no, let's see. The

---------------

 denominator is x * (2 * x^(10/x)), which is 2x^{1 + 10/x}.

So the

---------------

 exponent becomes 50/(2x^{1 + 10/x}) = 25/(x^{1 + 10/x}).

So now

---------------

, the equation is x = x^{25/(x^{1 + 10/x})}.

Since the bases are the same and x > 1, the

---------------

 exponents must be equal. So:

1 = 25/(x^{1 + 10/x}).

That

---------------

 gives us x^{1 + 10/x} = 25.

Hmm, okay, so x^{1 + 10/x} = 25.

Let

---------------

 me write that as x^{(x + 10)/x} = 25.

Taking both sides to the power of x/(

---------------

x + 10) to solve for x:

x = 25^{x/(x + 10)}.

Wait

---------------

, that's a bit tricky. Let's take the natural logarithm of both sides to make it easier.

Let’s denote

---------------

 t = x/(x + 10). So, x = 25^t.

Then, t = x/(x + 10) = [25^t]/(25^t + 10).

Hmm, this

---------------

 is an equation in terms of t. Let me write it as:

t = 25^t / (25^t + 10).

Multiply

---------------

 both sides by denominator:

t*(25^t + 10) = 25^t.

Expanding:



---------------

t*25^t + 10t = 25^t.

Bring all terms to one side:

t*25^t + 10t - 25^t = 0.

Factor out 25^t:

25^t*(t - 1) + 10t = 0.

Hmm, this

---------------

 looks complicated. Maybe I can try plugging in some integer values for t to see if it satisfies the equation.

Let me think

---------------

 about possible t values. Since x > 1, t = x/(x +10) will be less than 1 because

---------------

 x +10 > x. So t is between 0 and 1.

Let me test t=0.5:

Left

---------------

 side: 25^0.5 * (0.5 -1) + 10*(0.5) = 5*(-0.5) + 5 = (-2.5) +5 = 2.5 ≠

---------------

 0.

t=0.6:

25^0.6 ≈ 25^(3/5) = (5^2)^(3/5) =5^(6/5)=5

---------------

^(1.2)≈5*5^0.2≈5*1.38≈6.9.

So 

---------------

6.9*(0.6-1) +10*0.6=6.9*(-0.4) +6= -2.76 +6=3.24 ≠

---------------

0.

t=0.4:

25^0.4 = 5^(0.8)≈ 5^0.8≈3

---------------

.31.

So 3.31*(0.4-1) +10*0.4=3.31*(-0.6)+4≈-1.986 +4≈2.014≠0.

t=0.2

---------------

5:

25^0.25=5^(0.5)=√5≈2.236.

So 2.236*(0.25-1) +10*0.25=2.236*(-0.75)+2.5≈-1.677+2.5≈0.823≠0.

t=0.7

---------------

:

25^0.7≈5^(1.4)=5^(1 +0.4)=5*5^0.4≈5*2.378≈11.89.

11.89*(0.7-1) +10*0.7=11.89*(-0.3)+7≈-3.567+7≈3.433≠0.

Hmm, not

---------------

 zero yet. Let's try t=0.8:

25^0.8≈5^(1.6)=5^(1+0.6)=5*5^0.6≈5*3.311≈16.555.

16.555*(0.8-1)+10*0.8=16.555*(-0.2)+8≈-3.311+8≈4.689≠0.

Still

---------------

 positive. Maybe t=0.3:

25^0.3≈5^(0.6)=sqrt(5^0.6)=

---------------

sqrt(5^(3/5))≈sqrt(3.311)≈1.819.

So

---------------

 1.819*(0.3-1)+10*0.3=1.819*(-0.7)+3≈-1.273+3≈1.727≠0.

Hmm

---------------

, not zero. Maybe I need a better approach here. Perhaps instead of plugging in t, I should look for a

---------------

 substitution or another way to solve this.

Wait, going back to the equation x^{(x + 10)/x} = 25.

Which

---------------

 is x^{1 + 10/x} = 25.

Let me take natural logarithm on both sides:

(1 + 10/x) * ln x = ln 25.

So

---------------

, (1 + 10/x) * ln x = ln 25.

Let me write it as:

ln x + (10/x) ln x = ln 25.

Hmm

---------------

, perhaps I can factor out ln x:

ln x (1 + 10/x) = ln 25.

Wait

---------------

, that's the same as before. Maybe I can make a substitution here. Let me set u = ln x, which

---------------

 implies x = e^u.

Then, substituting, the equation becomes:

u (1 + 10/(e^u)) = ln 25.

So

---------------

,

u + (10u)/(e^u) = ln 25.

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation and

---------------

 might not have an algebraic solution. Maybe I can guess a value for u that satisfies this.

Let me compute ln 25.

---------------

 Since 25 is 5^2, ln25=2 ln5≈2*1.609≈3.218.

So,

---------------

 the equation is u + (10u)/(e^u) ≈3.218.

Let me try u=2:

Left side: 2 + (20)/(e^2)≈2 + 20/(7.389)≈2 +2.709≈4.709>3.218.

u=1:

1 + 10/(e)≈1 + 10/2.718≈1 +3.68≈4.68>3.218.

Too big. Let

---------------

's try u=0.5:

0.5 + (5)/(e^0.5)≈0.5 +5/1.648≈0.5+3.03≈3.53>3.218.

Clo

---------------

ser. Now, u=0.4:

0.4 + (4)/(e^0.4)≈0.4 +4/(1.4918)≈0.4 +2.68≈

---------------

3.08≈3.08<3.218.

So between 0.4 and 0.5.

At

---------------

 u=0.45:

0.45 + (4.5)/(e^0.45).

Compute e^0.45: e

---------------

^0.4≈1.4918; e^0.45≈1.5683.

So 4.5/1.5683≈2.871

---------------

.

So total≈0.45 +2.871≈3.321>3.218.

Hmm

---------------

, so between 0.4 and 0.45.

Wait, u=0.42:

0.42 + (4.2)/(e^0.42).

e^0.42≈1

---------------

.521.

4.2/1.521≈2.759.

Total≈0.42 +2.759≈3.179≈

---------------

3.179<3.218.

So between 0.42 and 0.45.

Let

---------------

 me try u=0.435:

0.435 + (4.35)/(e^0.435).

Compute e^0.435:

---------------

 Let's see, e^0.4≈1.4918, e^0.435≈

---------------

1.545 (approximating).

4.35/1.545≈2.817

---------------

.

Total≈0.435 +2.817≈3.252>3.218.

So

---------------

 between 0.42 and 0.435.

Hmm, u=0.43:

0.43 + (4.3)/(e^0.43).

e^0.43≈e

---------------

^0.4 * e^0.03≈1.4918 *1.03045≈1.538

---------------

.

4.3/1.538≈2.800.

Total≈0.43 +2.800≈3.230

---------------

>3.218.

Close. u=0.425:

0.425 + (4.25)/(e^0.425).

e^0.425≈e

---------------

^0.4 * e^0.025≈1.4918 *1.0253≈1.528.

4.25/1.528≈2.779.

Total≈0.425 +2.779≈3.204≈3.204<3.218.

So u

---------------

 is between 0.425 and 0.43.

At u=0.4275:

0

---------------

.4275 + (4.275)/(e^0.4275).

e^0.4275≈e

---------------

^0.42 * e^0.0075≈1.527 *1.0075≈1.537.

4.275/1.537≈2.781

---------------

.

Total≈0.4275 +2.781≈3.2085≈3.2085<

---------------

3.218.

Almost there. u=0.428:

0.428 +4.28/(e^0.428).

e^0.428≈ e

---------------

^0.42 * e^0.008≈1.527 *1.008≈1.538.

4.28/1.538≈2.782

---------------

.

Total≈0.428 +2.782≈3.210.

Still less than 3.218.

u=0.429:

0.429 +4.29/(e^0.429).

e^0.429≈1

---------------

.5385.

4.29/1.5385≈2.785.

Total≈0.429+2.785≈3.214.

Still

---------------

 less than 3.218.

u=0.43:

We did u=0.43,

---------------

 got 3.230.

Wait, but maybe my approximations are off. Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that u

---------------

 is such that 10u / e^u is approximately 3.218 - u.

But this might

---------------

 not lead me anywhere. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of x as 5, since 25 is 5 squared, and

---------------

 5 is a common log base. Let me test x=5.

If x=5, then from the first equation,

---------------

 log_x(y^x)=10.

Which is log_5(y^5)=10.

So 5 * log_5(y) =10 →

---------------

 log_5(y)=2 → y=5^2=25.

So y=25. Now check the second equation: log_y(x^{4y})=10.

So

---------------

 log_{25}(5^{4*25})= log_{25}(5^{100}).

But

---------------

 log_{25}(5^{100}) = (100) * log_{25}(5).

Since

---------------

 25 is 5^2, log_{25}(5)=1/2.

So (100)*(1/2)=50≠

---------------

10.

Hmm, that's not equal to 10. So x=5 is not a solution.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I made a mistake. Let me double-check.

Wait, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y})=10.

If

---------------

 x=5 and y=25, then x^{4y}=5^{100}.

log_{25}(5^{100})= ?



---------------

Since 25=5^2, so log_{25}(5) = 1/2, because (5^2)^(1/2)=5.

Therefore

---------------

, log_{25}(5^{100})=100 * log_{25}(5)=100*(1/2)=50.

---------------

 Which is not 10. So that's not a solution.

So x=5 is not the solution. Hmm.

Wait

---------------

, maybe x is 25. Let me try x=25.

From first equation: log_{25}(y^{25})=10.

So 25 * log_{25}(y)=10 → log_{25}(y)=10/25=0.4.

So

---------------

 y=25^{0.4}= (5^2)^{0.4}=5^{0.8}≈3.311.

Now check the second equation: log_y(x^{4y})=10.

x

---------------

=25, y≈3.311.

Compute x^{4y}=25^{4*3.311}=25^{13.244}.

log

---------------

_{3.311}(25^{13.244})=13.244 * log_{3.311}(25).

Compute

---------------

 log_{3.311}(25)= ln(25)/ln(3.311)≈3.2188

---------------

/1.199≈2.683.

So 13.244 * 2.683≈3

---------------

5.49≠10.

Not equal to 10. So x=25 is not the solution either.

Hmm, maybe

---------------

 I should think differently. Let's recall that I have y = x^(10/x) and x = y^(5/(2y)).

So

---------------

 maybe I can substitute y from the first equation into the second. So:

x = [x^(10/x)]^(5/(2y)).

But wait

---------------

, y is x^(10/x), so substituting:

x = [x^(10/x)]^(5/(2*x^(10/x))).

S

---------------

implify the exponent:

[10/x] * [5/(2*x^(10/x))] = (10 *5)/(x * 2 *x^(10/x)) )= 50/(2 x^{1 +10/x} )=25/(x^{1 +10/x}).

So x

---------------

 = x^{25/(x^{1 +10/x})}.

Which implies that 1 = 25/(x^{1 +10/x}).

Thus

---------------

, x^{1 +10/x}=25.

Which is the same equation I had before.

Hmm, perhaps taking

---------------

 log on both sides again:

(1 +10/x) ln x = ln25.

Let me write it as:

(1 +10/x) ln x = ln25.

Let

---------------

 me denote t = x, so the equation is:

(1 +10/t) ln t = ln25.

Hmm

---------------

, this seems like a transcendental equation. Maybe I can use substitution or trial and error to find t.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 I can set t = 5, but we saw that didn't work.

Wait, let me think of possible integer values for

---------------

 x. Let me try x=25, which didn't work. x=5 didn't work.

Wait, maybe

---------------

 x= sqrt(25)=5, which I tried. What about x= sqrt(5)? Let me see.

x

---------------

= sqrt(5)≈2.236.

Compute y =x^(10/x)= (2.236)^(10/2.236)≈2.236^(4.472).

Compute

---------------

 2.236^4≈25, and 2.236^0.472≈?



---------------

Wait, 2.236 is 5^0.5.

So 2.236^4=5^2=25.

2

---------------

.236^0.472= (5^0.5)^0.472=5^(0.236).

5

---------------

^0.236≈1.767.

So total y≈25 *1.767≈44.175.

Now

---------------

, check the second equation: log_y(x^{4y})=10.

x=2.236, y≈44.175.

Compute x^{4y}=2.236^{4*44.175}=2.236^{176.7}.

Take

---------------

 log base y of that: log_{44.175}(2.236^{176.7})=176.7 * log_{44.175}(2.236).

Compute log_{44.175}(2.236)= ln(2.236)/ln(44.175)≈0.807

---------------

/3.787≈0.213.

So 176.7 *0.213≈37.63

---------------

≈37.63≠10.

Hmm, not 10. So x= sqrt(5) is

---------------

 not the solution.

Wait, maybe I should think of x such that x^{1 +10/x}=25.

Let

---------------

 me consider that 25 is 5^2, so maybe x is 5^(something).

Let me let x=5^k, where k is some exponent.

Then x^{1 +10/x}= (5^k)^{1 +10/(5^k)}=5^{k(1 +10/(5^k))}=25=5^2.

Therefore, the

---------------

 exponents must be equal:

k(1 +10/(5^k)) =2.

So,

k + (10k)/(5^k)=2.

Hmm

---------------

, perhaps I can find k such that this holds.

Let me try k=1:

1 +10/5=1+2=3≠2.

k=0.5:

0.5 + (5)/(sqrt(5))=0.5 + sqrt(5)≈0.5+2.236≈2.736>2.

k=0.4:

0.4 + (4)/(5^0.4)=0.4 +4/(~

---------------

2.378)≈0.4 +1.68≈2.08>2.

k=0.35:

0.35 + (3.5)/(5^0.35).

5^0.35≈5^(0.35)=e^{0.35 ln5}≈e^{0.35*1.609}≈e^{0.563}≈1.756.

So 3.5/1.756≈2.0.

So 0.35 +2.0=2.35>2.

Wait

---------------

, that's not right. Wait, 3.5/1.756≈2.0.

So 

---------------

0.35 +2.0=2.35>2.

Hmm, too big. Let's try k=0.3.

0.3 + (3)/(5^0.3).

5^0.3≈e^{0.3*1.609}=e^{0.4827}≈1.62.

3/1.62≈1.85.

So 0.3 +1.85≈2.15>2.

k

---------------

=0.25:

0.25 + (2.5)/(5^0.25).

5^0.25=√√5≈1.495.

2.5/1.495≈1.671.

0.25 +1.671≈1.921<2.

So between k=0.25 and 0.3.

At

---------------

 k=0.28:

0.28 + (2.8)/(5^0.28).

Compute 5^0.28:

---------------

 ln5=1.609, 0.28*1.609≈0.4505.

---------------

 e^0.4505≈1.568.

2.8/1.568≈1.785

---------------

.

So 0.28 +1.785≈2.065>2.

k=0.27:

0.27 + (2.7)/(5^0.27).

5^0.27≈e^{0.27*1.609}≈e^{0.434}≈1.543.

2.7/1.543≈1.75.

0.27 +1.75≈2.02>2.

k=0.26:

0.26 +2.6/(5^0.26).

5^0.26≈e^{0.26*1.609}=e^{0.418}≈1.519.

2.6/1.519≈1.713

---------------

.

0.26 +1.713≈1.973<2.

So between 0.26 and 0.27.

k

---------------

=0.265:

0.265 +2.65/(5^0.265).

5^0.265≈e^{0.265*1.609}=e^{0.426}≈1.53.

2.65/1.53≈1.732.

0.265 +1.732≈1.997≈2. So

---------------

 k≈0.265.

So x=5^k≈5^0.265.

Compute 5^0.265: since

---------------

 5^0.25≈1.495, 5^0.3≈1.62, so 0.265 is closer

---------------

 to 0.25, let's approximate it as around 1.52.

So x≈1.52.

Now

---------------

, from y =x^(10/x).

x≈1.52, so 10/x≈6.585.

So y≈1.52^6.585.

Compute 1.52^6≈

---------------

1.52^2=2.31, ^4≈(2.31)^2≈5.34, ^6≈5.34*2.31≈12.35

---------------

.

1.52^0.585≈sqrt(1.52^0.585).

---------------

 Wait, 0.585 is about 0.6, so 1.52^0.6≈ e

---------------

^{0.6 ln1.52}≈e^{0.6*0.418}=e^{0.2508}≈1.284.

So total y≈12.35 *1.284≈15.91

---------------

.

Now, let's check the second equation: log_y(x^{4y})=10.

Compute x^{4y}=1.52^{4*15.91}=1.52^{63.64}.

Compute

---------------

 log base y of that: log_{15.91}(1.52^{63.64})=63.64 * log_{15.91}(1.52).

Compute log_{15.91}(1.52)= ln(1.52)/ln(15.91)≈0.418/2.763

---------------

≈0.1514.

So 63.64 *0.1514≈9.62≈9.62, which is close to 10, but not exact. Hmm

---------------

.

But perhaps with a more accurate k, we can get closer. Alternatively, perhaps I made some approximations that are leading

---------------

 to inaccuracies.

Wait, perhaps there's a better approach. Let me think again.

From earlier, we have:

x

---------------

^{1 + 10/x} =25.

Let me take the natural log:

(1 +10/x) ln x = ln25.

Let

---------------

 me denote t = x, then the equation becomes:

(1 + 10/t) ln t = ln25.

Hmm

---------------

, perhaps I can make a substitution u = t.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let z = ln t, so t = e^z.

Substituting, the

---------------

 equation becomes:

(1 +10/e^z) * z = ln25.

So,

z + (10 z)/e^z = ln25 ≈3.218.

Hmm

---------------

, this seems similar to before. Let me try to find z such that z +10z e^{-z}=3.218.

Let

---------------

 me write it as:

z (1 +10 e^{-z})=3.218.

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 trying z=1:

1*(1 +10/e)=1 +3.679≈4.679>3.218.

z=0.5:

0.5*(1 +10 e^{-0.5})=0.5*(1 +10/1.648)≈0.5*(1 +6.065)≈0.5*7.065≈3.532>3.218.

z=0.4:

0.4*(1 +10 e^{-0.4})=0.4*(1 +10/1.4918)≈0.4*(1 +6.7)=

---------------

0.4*7.7≈3.08≈3.08<3.218.

So between 0.4 and 0.5.

z=0.45:

0.45*(1 +10 e^{-0.45})=0.45*(1 +10/1.5683)≈0.45*(1+6.38)=

---------------

0.45*7.38≈3.321>3.218.

z=0.43:

0.43*(1 +10 e^{-0.43})=0.43*(1 +10/1.537)=0.43*(1+6.505

---------------

)=0.43*7.505≈3.227≈3.227>3.218.

Close.

z=0.425:

0.425*(1 +10 e^{-0.425})=0.425*(1 +10/1.528)=0.425*(1+6.548

---------------

)=0.425*7.548≈3.205≈3.205<3.218.

So between 0.425 and 0.43.

At

---------------

 z=0.4275:

0.4275*(1 +10 e^{-0.4275})=0.4275*(1 +10/1.532

---------------

)=0.4275*(1 +6.527)=0.4275*7.527≈3.216

---------------

≈3.216.

Almost there. So z≈0.4275.

So x=e^{z}=e^{0.4275}≈1.533.

Now

---------------

, y =x^{10/x}=1.533^{10/1.533}=1.533^{6.523

---------------

}.

Compute 1.533^6: 1.533^2≈2.351; ^4≈(2.351)^2≈5.527

---------------

; ^6≈5.527 *2.351≈13.00.

1.533^0.523≈e

---------------

^{0.523 ln1.533}=e^{0.523*0.427}=e^{0.223}≈1.25.

So y≈13.00 *1.25≈16.25.

Now, check the second equation: log_y(x^{4y})=10.

x=1.533, y≈16.25.

Compute x^{4y}=1.533^{4*16.25}=1.533^{65}.

Compute

---------------

 log_{16.25}(1.533^{65})=65 * log_{16.25}(1.533).

Compute log_{16.25}(1.533)= ln1.533 / ln16.25≈0.427/2.786

---------------

≈0.1533.

So 65 *0.1533≈9.965≈10.

That

---------------

's very close, so this suggests that x≈1.533 and y≈16.25, leading

---------------

 to xy≈1.533*16.25≈24.85.

Hmm, but the

---------------

 problem states that x and y are both greater than 1, so 24.85 is plausible, but perhaps

---------------

 the exact value is 25.

Wait, maybe I made some approximation errors. Let me see if xy=25 is

---------------

 the exact solution.

Wait, let me think again. If I assume that xy=25, does that satisfy the original

---------------

 equations?

Let me check.

Suppose xy=25.

Then, from the first equation, log_x(y^x)=10.

Which is x log_x(y) =10.

So

---------------

, log_x(y)=10/x.

Which implies y =x^{10/x}.

Similarly, from the second equation, log_y(x^{4y})=10.

Which is 4y log_y(x)=10.

So, log_y(x)=10/(4y)=5/(2y).

Which implies x=y^{5/(2y)}.

Now

---------------

, since y =x^{10/x}, substitute into x=y^{5/(2y)}.

So, x= [x^{10/x}]^{5/(2y)}.

But

---------------

 y= x^{10/x}, so substitute y:

x= [x^{10/x}]^{5/(2 *

---------------

x^{10/x})}.

Which is x= x^{(10/x) * [5/(2 *

---------------

x^{10/x})]}.

Simplify the exponent:

(10/x) * [5/(2 *x^{10/x})] = (50)/(2 x^{1 +10/x})=25/(x^{1 +10/x}).

So x= x^{25/(x^{1 +10/x})}.

Which

---------------

 implies that 1=25/(x^{1 +10/x}).

So, x^{1 +10/x}=25.

Which

---------------

 is the same equation as before. So if x^{1 +10/x}=25, and since we're assuming

---------------

 xy=25, then perhaps it's consistent.

Wait, if x^{1 +10/x}=25, and xy

---------------

=25, then y=25/x.

So substituting y=25/x into x^{1 +10/x}=25.

Let

---------------

 me write x^{1 +10/x}=25.

Take natural log:

(1 +10/x) ln x = ln25.

But

---------------

 if y=25/x, then from y =x^{10/x}, we have:

25/x =x^{10/x}.

Multiply

---------------

 both sides by x:

25 =x^{1 +10/x}.

Which is exactly the equation we had.

---------------

 So this suggests that if xy=25, then the equations are satisfied.

Therefore, the product xy=25.


We

---------------

 are given that real numbers \( x \) and \( y \), both greater than 1, satisfy the equations:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.
\]

###

---------------

 Step 1: Convert Logarithmic Equations to Exponential Form

1. From \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \):
   \[
   x \cdot \log_x(y) = 10 \implies \log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x}.
   \]
   Let

---------------

 \( y = x^{10/x} \).

2. From \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \):
   \[
   4y \cdot \log_y(x) = 10 \implies \log_y(x) = \frac{10}{4y} = \frac{5}{2y}.
   \]
   Let \( x = y^{5/(2y)} \).

### Step 2: Substitute \( y \) from the First Equation into the Second

Substitute \( y = x^{10/x} \) into \( x = y^{5/(2y)} \):
\[
x = \left(x^{10/x}\right)^{5/(2y)}.
\]
Since \( y = x^{10/x} \), substitute \(

---------------

 y \):
\[
x = \left(x^{10/x}\right)^{5/(2x^{10/x})}.
\]
Simplify the exponent:
\[
x = x^{\frac{10/x \cdot 5}{2x^{10/x}}} = x^{\frac{25}{x^{1 + 10/x}}}.
\]
Since

---------------

 the bases are equal, the exponents must be equal:
\[
1 = \frac{25}{x^{1 + 10/x}} \implies x^{1 + 10/x} = 25.
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \) and \( y \)

Taking

---------------

 the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[
(1 + \frac{10}{x}) \ln x = \ln 25.
\]
Let \( t = \ln x \), then \( x = e^t \), and the equation becomes:
\[
(1 + \frac{10}{e^t}) t = \ln 25.
\]
This

---------------

 transcendental equation is solved numerically, yielding \( x \approx 1.533 \).

Using \( y = x^{10/x} \), we find:
\[
y \approx 1.533^{6.523} \approx 16.25.
\]

### Step 4: Verify the Product \( xy \)

Given

---------------

 \( x \approx 1.533 \) and \( y \approx 16.25 \), the product is:
\[
xy \approx 1.533 \times 16.25 \approx 25.
\]

### Conclusion

The exact product \( xy \) is \( 25 \), satisfying both original logarithmic equations.

\[
\boxed{25}
