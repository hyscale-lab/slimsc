Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. 

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The

---------------

 tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We are

---------------

 given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find the length of AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

First, I should

---------------

 probably draw a diagram to visualize what's going on. But since I don't have paper right now, I'll try to imagine it. Triangle

---------------

 ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. The

---------------

 tangents at B and C meet at D, which is the ex-pole of BC. Then AD intersects ω again at P. So

---------------

, we need to find AP.

I remember that when two tangents are drawn from a point to a circle, the lengths from that point to the points of tangency are equal. So, BD

---------------

 = CD because both are tangents from D to ω. That might come in handy.

Since ABC is inscribed in ω, �

---------------

� is its circumcircle. So, points A, B, C, P lie on ω. AD is a secant that

---------------

 intersects ω at A and P, so by the power of a point, the power of point D with respect to ω should relate the

---------------

 lengths of DB, DC, DA, and DP.

Wait, Power of a Point says that for a point D outside the circle, the power is equal to DB^2 = DC^2 = DA * DP. Because

---------------

 DB and DC are both tangent lengths, so DB = DC, and DA * DP is the power as well.

So, let

---------------

 me write that down: DB^2 = DA * DP.

Hmm, so if I can find DA, then I can find

---------------

 DP, and since AP = DP - DA (or maybe DA + DP? Wait, no, AP is the length from A to P,

---------------

 so if D is outside, then AD is a secant, and AP is from A to P, which is inside the circle. So,

---------------

 AP = AD - DP? Wait, no, wait. Let me think.

Actually, AD is a line from A through D, but

---------------

 since D is outside the circle, AD extends beyond the circle to P. So, the order is A, then P, then D.

---------------

 So, AP is the segment from A to P, and PD is from P to D. So, the length AP is

---------------

 less than AD. So, the power of point D is DP * DA = DB^2.

Wait, actually, Power

---------------

 of a Point says that for a point outside the circle, the power is equal to the product of the lengths from the point to the intersection points of any secant line through the point. So, in

---------------

 this case, the secant is DP and DA, but wait, D is outside, so the two intersection points are P and A. So, the

---------------

 power should be DP * DA.

But wait, more precisely, the Power of a Point formula is: If a secant from D passes through the circle at two

---------------

 points X and Y, then DX * DY = power of D. In this case, the two points are P and A, so it's DP * DA = DB^2.

But

---------------

 wait, actually, the order is important. Since D is outside, the points are D, then P, then A?

---------------

 No, because A is on the circle, so from D, the line goes through P first, then A. Wait, no

---------------

, that can't be, because A is on the circle, so if D is outside, the line from D to A must

---------------

 enter the circle at P and exit at A. Wait, but A is already on the circle. Hmm, no. Wait

---------------

, actually, A is on the circle, so the line DA starts at D, goes through P, which is the other intersection point, then through

---------------

 A. So, the order is D, P, A.

So, the distances would be DP and DA. But DA

---------------

 is from D to A, which is the entire length, and DP is from D to P, which is shorter. So, the

---------------

 power of D is DP * DA = DB^2.

Wait, but I think the correct formula is DP * DA = DB^2. So

---------------

, DP * DA = DB^2. Therefore, DP = DB^2 / DA.

But then, AP is the length from A to P. Since the

---------------

 points are in the order D, P, A, AP would be DA - DP. Wait, but DA is from D to A, and

---------------

 DP is from D to P, so AP = DP + PA? Wait, no, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 it's better to think in terms of segments. Let me denote:

- Let’s say the length from D to P is x, and from P to A is y. So, DA

---------------

 = DP + PA, which would be x + y. But since A is on the circle, and P is another intersection point, then

---------------

 AP is y. So, from D, the line goes through P (length x from D) and then A (length y from P). So, DA = x + y.

But

---------------

 according to the Power of a Point, we have DP * DA = DB^2. So, x*(x + y) = DB^2.

But we

---------------

 need to find AP, which is y. So, y = AP = (DA * DB^2)/(x * (

---------------

x + y))? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think of DA as the length from D to A, and DP as the length from D to P. Since

---------------

 P is between D and A, DA = DP + AP. So, DA = DP + AP.

So, the Power of a Point gives

---------------

 us DP * DA = DB^2.

But DA = DP + AP, so substituting:

DP * (DP + AP) = DB^2.

So

---------------

, DP^2 + DP * AP = DB^2.

But that still leaves us with two variables, DP and AP. Hmm

---------------

, not helpful yet.

Wait, maybe there's another approach. Since we have triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10, we can compute

---------------

 its circumradius. Then, perhaps use that to find other lengths.

Yes, that seems promising. Let's compute the circumradius R of triangle ABC.

The

---------------

 formula for the circumradius R is (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where a, b, c are the sides, and Δ is the area.

So

---------------

, let's assign the sides: Let’s say a = BC = 9, b = AC = 10, c = AB = 5.

First

---------------

, compute the semi-perimeter, s = (a + b + c)/2 = (9 + 10 + 5)/2 = (24)/2 = 12.

Then, the

---------------

 area Δ can be found using Heron's formula: sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)].

So, Δ = sqrt[12*(12 - 9)*(12 - 10)*(12 -5)] = sqrt[12 * 3 * 2 *7] = sqrt[12*3*2*7] = sqrt[504].

Simplify sqrt(504): 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, no

---------------

, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5? Wait, 504 = 16*31.5?

---------------

 No, 16*31 is 496, 16*31.5=504. But

---------------

 31.5 is 63/2, so sqrt(16 * 63/2) = 4 * sqrt(63/2) = 4 * (sqrt(63)/sqrt(2)) ) = 4*(3*sqrt(7)/sqrt(2)) ) = 12*sqrt(7/2). Hmm, but

---------------

 that's messy. Maybe factor 504 differently.

Wait, 504 = 8 * 63 = 8 * 9 *7. So, sqrt(504) = sqrt(8*9*7) = sqrt(8)*sqrt(9)*sqrt(7) = 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14). Wait

---------------

, is that right?

Wait, 8*9*7 is 504, so sqrt(8*9*7) = sqrt(8) * sqrt(9) * sqrt(7) = 2√2 * 3 * √7 = 6√14. Yes, that's correct. So, Δ = 6√14.

So

---------------

, the area is 6√14.

Now, the circumradius R = (a*b*c)/(4Δ) = (9*10*5)/(4*6√14) = (450)/(24√14) = (75)/(4√14).

We

---------------

 can rationalize the denominator: (75)/(4√14) = (75√14)/(4*14) = (75√14)/56.

So, R = 75√14 / 56.

Wait

---------------

, but is that correct? Let me double-check:

a=9, b=10, c=5.

a

---------------

*b*c = 9*10*5 = 450.

4Δ = 4*6√14 =24√14.

So, R = 450 / (24√14) = (450)/(

---------------

24√14). Simplify numerator and denominator:

Divide numerator and denominator by 6: 450/6 =75, 24/6=4.

So, R =75/(4√14).

---------------

 Then, rationalizing, 75√14/(4*14)=75√14/56. So

---------------

 yes, correct.

So, R =75√14 /56.

But how does that help us? Hmm

---------------

.

Wait, perhaps we can use coordinates or trigonometric relations. Alternatively, maybe use inversion, but that might be complicated

---------------

.

Alternatively, maybe use the concept of harmonic division or projective geometry, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Since

---------------

 D is the intersection of tangents at B and C, then D is the ex-similicenter of the circumcircle with

---------------

 respect to BC. Or maybe it's related to the symmedian point.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps use coordinates. Let me try

---------------

 coordinate geometry.

Let me place point C at the origin (0,0). Let me place point A at (10,0), since AC=10. Then point B is somewhere in the plane.

---------------

 We can find its coordinates using the distances AB=5 and BC=9.

So, coordinates:

Let’s denote:

- C = (0,0)
- A = (10,0)
- B = (x,y)

We know that AB

---------------

=5 and BC=9.

So, distance from A to B: sqrt[(x -10)^2 + y^2] =5 =>

---------------

 (x-10)^2 + y^2=25. (1)

Distance from B to C: sqrt[x^2 + y^2]=9 => x^2 + y^2=81. (2)

Subtract equation (2) from equation (1):

(x-10)^2 + y^2 - (x^2 + y^2) =25 -81 =>

---------------

 (x^2 -20x +100) + y^2 -x^2 - y^2 = -56 => -20x +100 = -56 => -20x = -156 => x=156/20=39/5=7.8.

So, x=7.8=

---------------

39/5.

Then, from equation (2), x^2 + y^2=81:

(39/5)^2 + y^2=81 => (1521/25) + y^2=81 => y^2=81 -1521/25= (2025/25 -1521/25)=504/25.

So, y= sqrt(504/25)=sqrt(504)/5.



---------------

Simplify sqrt(504): 504=16*31.5? Wait, 504=16*31.5?

---------------

 Wait, 16*31=496, 16*31.5=504. So

---------------

 sqrt(504)=sqrt(16*31.5)=4*sqrt(31.5). But 31.5 is 63/2, so sqrt(31.5)=sqrt(63/2)= (3√14)/√2=

---------------

 (3√14)/√2= 3√7.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(504):



---------------

504=16*31.5=16*(63/2)=8*63=8*9*7= 72*7. Hmm, sqrt

---------------

(72*7)=sqrt(72)*sqrt(7)=6√2 * √7=6√14.

Wait

---------------

, yes, because sqrt(72)=6√2, so sqrt(72*7)=6√14. So, sqrt(504)=6√14. Therefore

---------------

, y=6√14 /5.

So, point B is at (39/5, 6√14/5). So

---------------

, coordinates:

A=(10,0), B=(39/5, 6√14/5), C=(0,0).

Now, we

---------------

 need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle ω of ABC.

First

---------------

, we need the equation of the circumcircle ω. Since points A, B, C lie on it.

We can find the equation of ω using

---------------

 the coordinates of A, B, C.

Alternatively, since we already computed the circumradius R=75√14/56, and

---------------

 knowing that the center is at the circumcenter O.

Wait, maybe computing the circumcenter O is a good idea.

The

---------------

 circumcenter is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC.

Let me compute the perpendicular bisector of AC first

---------------

.

AC is from (0,0) to (10,0). The midpoint is (5,0). The perpendicular bisector is the line perpendicular to AC (which is horizontal) at

---------------

 (5,0). So, it's the vertical line x=5.

Now, find the perpendicular bisector of AB.

Point

---------------

 A is (10,0), point B is (39/5, 6√14/5).

Midpoint M of AB: x

---------------

=(10 + 39/5)/2, y=(0 + 6√14/5)/2.

Compute x: 10=50/5, so 50/5 +39/5=89/5. Div

---------------

ided by 2: 89/10=8.9.

y: (6√14/5)/2=3√14/5.

So, midpoint M is (89/10, 3√14/5).

Now, the slope of AB: (yB - yA)/(xB - xA)= (6√14/5 -0)/(39/5 -10)= (6√14/5)/(39/5 -50/5)= (6√14/5)/(-11/5)= -6√14/11.

So, the slope of AB is -6√14/11. Therefore, the slope of the perpendicular bisector is the negative reciprocal, which is 11/(6√14).

S

---------------

implify: 11/(6√14) = (11√14)/(6*14)= (11√14)/84. Wait, no

---------------

, that's rationalizing, but actually, it's just 11/(6√14). Alternatively, we can leave

---------------

 it as is.

So, the equation of the perpendicular bisector of AB is:

(y - 3√14/5) = (11/(6√14))(x - 89/10).

Now

---------------

, the circumcenter O is at the intersection of x=5 and this line.

So, substitute x=5 into the equation:

y - 3√14/5 = (11/(6√14))(5 - 89/10).

Compute 5 -89/10: 5 is 50/10, so 50/10 -89/10= -39/10.

So,

y - 3√14/5 = (11/(6√14))*(-39/10).

Compute the right-hand side:

(11 * (-39)) / (6√14 *10) = (-429)/(60√14) = (-143)/(20√14).

R

---------------

ationalizing the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by √14:

(-143√14)/(20*14)= (-143√14)/280.

So,

y = 3√14/5 + (-143√14)/280.

Convert 3√14/5 to denominator

---------------

 280:

3√14/5 = (3√14 *56)/280=168√14/280.

So,

y = (168√14/280) - (143√14)/280 = (168√14 -143√14)/280 = (25√14)/280 = (5√14)/56.

Thus, the circumcenter O is at (5, 5√14/56).

So

---------------

, O=(5,5√14/56).

Now, we can find the equation of the tangent at B to

---------------

 the circumcircle ω.

The tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, the slope of the tangent at B is the negative reciprocal of the slope of OB.

First, compute the slope of OB.

Point O is (5,5√14/56), point B is (39/5,6√14/5).

Slope of OB: (yB - yO)/(xB - xO) = [6√14/5 -5√14/56]/[39/5 -5].

Compute numerator:

Convert to common denominator, which is 56*5=280.

6√14/5 = (6√14 *56)/280=336√14/280.

5√14/56= (5√14 *5)/280=25√14/280.

So, numerator=336√14/280 -25√14/280=311√14/280.

Denominator: 39/5 -5=39/5 -25/5=14/5.

So, slope of OB=

---------------

 (311√14/280)/(14/5)= (311√14/280)*(5/14)= (311√14 *5)/(280*14)= (1555√14)/(3920).

Simplify numerator

---------------

 and denominator:

Divide numerator and denominator by 5: 1555/5=311, 3920/5=784.

So, slope of OB=311√14/784.

Thus

---------------

, the slope of the tangent at B is the negative reciprocal: -784/(311√14).

We

---------------

 can rationalize this: -784/(311√14) = (-784√14)/(311*14) = (-784√14)/(4354) = (-

---------------

784/4354)√14.

Simplify 784/4354: Let

---------------

's see, 784 divides by 2: 392, 4354/2=2177. 392 and 2177.



---------------

Check if 392 and 2177 have a common factor. 392=49*8=7^2*2^3. 2177 divided by 7: 2177/7=311, which

---------------

 is a prime number. So, 2177=7*311.

So, 392/2177= (49*8)/(7*311)= (7*7*8)/(7*311)= (7*8)/311=56/311.

So, slope of tangent at B is (-56√14)/311.

Similarly, the

---------------

 tangent at C: since C is at (0,0), the tangent at C can be found similarly.

Slope of OC: point

---------------

 O is (5,5√14/56), point C is (0,0).

Slope of OC: (5√14/56 -0)/(5 -0)= (5√14/56)/5= √14/56.

Thus, slope of tangent at C is the negative reciprocal: -56/√14= -56√14/14= -4√14.

So, the

---------------

 tangent at C has slope -4√14.

Now, we have equations for both tangents at B and C. Their

---------------

 intersection is point D.

So, equation of tangent at B:

We have point B=(39/5,6√14/5) and slope m=-56√14/311.

Equation: y -6√14/5 = (-56√14/311)(x -39/5).

Equation of tangent at C:

Point

---------------

 C=(0,0), slope m=-4√14.

Equation: y = -4√14 x.

Now, to

---------------

 find point D, solve these two equations.

So, substitute y from the second equation into the first.

So,

-4√14 x -6√14/5 = (-56√14/311)(x -39/5).

Let me write this

---------------

 out:

Left side: y = -4√14 x.

So, plug into the first equation:

-4√14 x -6√14/5 = (-56√14/311)(x -39/5).

Let

---------------

 me factor out √14 from all terms:

√14 [ -4x -6/5 ] = √14 [ (-56/311)(x -39/5) ].

We can divide both sides by √14:

-4x -6/5 = (-56/311)(x -39/5).

Multiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:

311*(-4x -6/5) = -56*(x -39/5).

Compute left side:

311*(-4x) +311*(-6/5) = -1244x - (1866/5).

Right side:

-56x + (56*39)/5 = -56x + 2184/5.

So, equation

---------------

 becomes:

-1244x -1866/5 = -56x +2184/5.

Bring all terms to left side:

-1244x +56x -1866/5 -2184/5=0.

Combine like terms:

(-1244 +56)x + (-1866 -2184)/5=0.

-

---------------

1188x -4050/5=0.

Simplify:

-1188x -810=0.

So

---------------

,

-1188x =810 => x=810/(-1188)= -810/1188.

Simplify the

---------------

 fraction:

Divide numerator and denominator by 18:

810 ÷18=45, 1188 ÷18=66.

So, x= -45/66= -15/22.

So, x= -15/22.

Now, substitute

---------------

 x into y= -4√14 x:

y= -4√14*(-15/22)= (60√14)/22= (30√14)/11.

So, point D is at (-15/22, 30√14/11).

Now, we have point D,

---------------

 and we need to find the equation of line AD.

Point A is at (10,0), point D is at (-15/22, 30√14/11).

Compute the slope of AD:

m_AD

---------------

= (yD - yA)/(xD - xA)= (30√14/11 -0)/(-15/22 -10)= (30√14/11)/(-15/22 -220/22)= (30√14/11)/(-235/22)= (30√14/11)*( -22/235 )= (30√14 * -22)/(11*235).

Simplify:

30 and 235: 235=5*47, 30=5*6. So, 30/235=6/47.

-

---------------

22/11= -2.

So, slope m_AD= (6√14)*(-2)/47= (-12√14)/47.

So, the slope of AD is -12√14/47.

Now, equation of AD: using

---------------

 point A (10,0):

y -0 = (-12√14/47)(x -10).

So, y= (-12√14/47)x + (120√14)/47.

Now, we

---------------

 need to find point P, which is the other intersection of AD with ω.

We already know that A is on both AD and ω. We need the other point P.

So

---------------

, we can solve the equation of AD with the equation of ω.

We have the equation of ω: It's a circle passing through A, B, C.

---------------

 We can find its equation using the center O=(5,5√14/56) and radius R=75√14/56.

The

---------------

 equation is (x -5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

Alternatively

---------------

, since we have coordinates for O and R, we can plug in the equation of AD into the circle equation.

But that

---------------

 might be a bit involved, but let's proceed.

First, write the equation of AD: y= (-12√14/47)x + (120√14)/47.

Sub

---------------

stitute this into the circle equation:

(x -5)^2 + [ (-12√14/47 x +120√14/47 -5√14/56 ) ]^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

This

---------------

 looks complicated. Let me simplify step by step.

First, let me compute the y-component:

y - yO = [ (-12√14/47)x +120√14/47 -5√14/56 ].

Let

---------------

 me factor out √14:

= √14 [ (-12/47)x +120/47 -5/56 ].

Compute

---------------

 the constants inside:

Let me compute 120/47 -5/56.

Find a common denominator,

---------------

 which is 47*56=2632.

120/47= (120*56)/2632=6720/2632.

5/56= (5*47)/2632=235/2632.

So, 120/47 -5/56=6720/2632 -235/2632=6485/2632.

So

---------------

, y - yO= √14 [ (-12/47)x +6485/2632 ].

So

---------------

, the equation becomes:

(x -5)^2 + [√14*(-12x/47 +6485/2632)]^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

S

---------------

implify the terms:

First, square the second term:

[√14*(-12x/47 +6485/2632)]^2=14*( (-12x/47 +6485/2632 )^2.

So, the

---------------

 equation is:

(x -5)^2 +14*( (-12x/47 +6485/2632 )^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

Compute the

---------------

 right-hand side:

(75√14/56)^2= (75^2 *14)/(56^2)= (5625 *14)/(3136)=78750/3136.

Simplify 78750/3136: Divide

---------------

 numerator and denominator by 2: 39375/1568.

So, RHS=39375/1568.

Now, expand

---------------

 the equation:

(x -5)^2 +14*( ( (-12x/47 +6485/2632 ) )^2 )=39375/1568.

This is

---------------

 going to be messy. Let me try to compute each part.

First, expand (x -5)^2= x^2 -10x +25.

Now, the second term: 14*( (-12x/47 +6485/2632 )^2.

Let me compute (-12x/47 +6485/2632 )

---------------

^2:

Let me denote A= -12x/47, B=6485/2632.

So, (A + B)^2= A^2 + 2AB + B^2.

Compute each term:

A^2= (144x²)/(47²)=144x²/2209.

2AB=2*(-12x/47)(6485/2632)=2*(-12x*6485)/(47*2632).

Compute denominator:47*2632=4

---------------

7*(2600 +32)=47*2600 +47*32=122,200 + 1,504=123,704.

Numerator:2*(-12x*6485)= -24x*6485= -155,640x.

So, 2AB= (-155,640x)/123,704.

Simplify the

---------------

 fraction:

Divide numerator and denominator by 8:

-155,640 ÷8= -19,455,

---------------

 123,704 ÷8=15,463.

So, 2AB= (-19,455x)/15,463.

Wait

---------------

, 15,463: let me see if it divides into 19,455.

15,463 *1=15,463.

---------------

 19,455 -15,463=3,992.

So, no, not

---------------

 a factor. So, 2AB= (-19,455x)/15,463.

B

---------------

^2= (6485)^2/(2632)^2.

Compute 6485^2: Let

---------------

 me compute 6485*6485.

This is a bit tedious, but perhaps we can note that 6485=6400+85.

So, (6400 +85)^2=6400² +2*6400*85 +85²=40,960,000 + 1,088,000 +7,225=40,960,000+1,088,000=42,048,000 +7,225=42,055,225.

Similarly

---------------

, 2632^2: Let's compute 2632*2632.

2632 is

---------------

 2600 +32.

So, (2600 +32)^2=2600² +2*2600*32 +32²=6,760,000 + 166,400 +1,024=6,760,000+166,400=6,926,400 +1,024=6,927,424.

So, B^2=42,055,225 /6,927,424.

So

---------------

, putting it all together, the second term is:

14*(144x²/2209 + (-19,455x)/15,463 +42,055,225 /6,927,424).

So

---------------

, let's compute each part:

14*(144x²/2209)= (14*144x²)/2209=2016x²/2209.

14*(-19,455x)/15,463= (-272,370x)/15,463.

14*(42,055,225 /6,927,424)= (588,773,150)/6,927,424.

Simplify fractions

---------------

 where possible.

So, the entire equation becomes:

(x² -10x +25) + [2016x²/2209 -272,370x/15,463 +588,773,150/6,927,424] =39375/1568.

Combine

---------------

 like terms:

x² + (2016/2209)x² + (-10x) + (-272,370/15,463)x +25 +588,773,150/6,927,424 =39375/1568.

Compute

---------------

 coefficients:

Coefficient of x²:1 +2016/2209= (2209 +2016)/2209=4225/2209.

Coefficient of x: -10 -272,370/15,463= Let

---------------

's compute 10 as 154,630/15,463 (since 10*15,463=154,630). So, -154,630/15,463 -272,370/15,463= (-427,000)/15,463.

Constant term:25 +588,773,150/6,927,424.

Convert

---------------

 25 to 6,927,424 denominator:25=25*6,927,424/6,927,424=173,185,600/6,927,424.

So, constant

---------------

 term=173,185,600/6,927,424 +588,773,150/6,927,424= (173,185,600 +588,773,150)/6,927,424=761,958,750/6,927,424.

So, now

---------------

 the equation is:

(4225/2209)x² + (-427,000/15,463)x +761,958,750/6,927,424 =39375/1568.

Multiply

---------------

 both sides by the least common multiple (LCM) of denominators to eliminate fractions.

The denominators are 2209,15,463,6,927,424, and 1568.

Let

---------------

 me factor each denominator:

2209=47².

15,463: Let me check if

---------------

 15,463 divides by 47: 47*329=15,463? 47*300=14,100; 47*29=1,363. So, 14,100 +1,363=15,463. Yes, 47*329=15,463.

6

---------------

,927,424: Let me see, 6,927,424 ÷ 

---------------

47=?

Well, 47 *147,000=6,909,000. 6,927,424 -6,909,000=18,424.

47*392=18,424. So, 6,927,424=47*(147,000 +392)=47*147,392.

Similarly

---------------

, 1568= 16*98=16*14²=2^4 *7².

So, L

---------------

CM of denominators:

Factors:

2209=47²,

15,463=47*329,

6,927,424=47*147,392,

1568=2^4*7².

So, LCM would

---------------

 be 47² * 329 *147,392 *2^4 *7².

This is getting

---------------

 too big; maybe instead of multiplying all terms by LCM, which is massive, perhaps find a better approach.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 we can parameterize the line AD and plug into the circle equation.

Alternatively, since we have point A on the circle and line

---------------

 AD, perhaps parametrize AD with a parameter t and find t where the parametric equations satisfy the circle.

Parametrize AD:

---------------

 starting at A (10,0), direction vector towards D (-15/22 -10, 30√14/11 -0)= (-15/22 -220/22, 30√14/11)= (-235/22, 30√14/11).

So, the direction vector is (-235/22, 30√14/11).

Parametric equations:

x =10 + (-235/22)t,

y=0 + (30√14/11)t.

We

---------------

 need to find t where (x,y) lies on ω.

So, plug into circle equation: (x -5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

Substitute x and y:

[ (10 -5) + (-235/22)t ]^2 + [ (30√14/11 t) -5√14/56 ]^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

Simplify each term.

First term: (5 -235t/22)^2.

Second term: [

---------------

 (30√14/11)t -5√14/56 ]^2.

Let me compute each term

---------------

.

First term: (5 - (235t)/22)^2=25 - 2*5*(235t)/22 + (235t/22)^2=25 - (2350t)/22 + (55,225t²)/484.

Second term: [

---------------

 (30√14/11 t) -5√14/56 ]^2.

Factor out √14: √14[

---------------

30t/11 -5/56].

So, squared:14*(30t/11 -5/56)^2.

Compute inside:

30t/11 -5/56=

---------------

 (30*56 t -5*11)/(11*56)= (1680t -55)/616.

So, squared

---------------

: (1680t -55)^2 / (616)^2.

Multiply by 14:14*(1680t -55)^2 / (616)^2.

S

---------------

implify:

14/(616)^2=14/(379,456)=1/(27,104).

So

---------------

, second term= (1680t -55)^2 /27,104.

So, putting

---------------

 it all together:

[25 - (2350t)/22 + (55,225t²)/484] + [ (1680t -55)^2 /27,104 ] = (75√14/56)^2=3

---------------

9375/1568.

Multiply both sides by 27,104 to eliminate denominators.

2

---------------

7,104*[25 - (2350t)/22 + (55,225t²)/484] + (1680t -55)^2 =27,104*(39375/1568).

Compute each term.

First term:27,104*25=677,600.

27,104*( -2350t/22 )=2

---------------

7,104*(-2350)/22 *t= (27,104/22)*(-2350)t=1,232*(-2350)t= -2,906

---------------

,000t.

27,104*(55,225t²)/484= (27,104/484)*55,225t²= (56)*55,225t²=3,097

---------------

,  56*55,225=56*(55,000 +225)=56*55,000=3,080,000 +56*225=12,600 →

---------------

 total 3,092,600 t².

Second term: (1680t -55)^2= (1680t)^2 - 2*1680t*55 +55^2=2,822,400t² -184,800t +3,025.

Right

---------------

 side:27,104*(39375/1568)= (27,104/1568)*39,375.

Simplify 27,104 ÷1568: 

---------------

1568*17=26,656; 27,104 -26,656=448. 448=

---------------

1568*(448/1568)=1/3.5? Wait, 448=

---------------

1568/3.5=448=1568*(1/3.5)=1

---------------

568*(2/7)=448. So, 27,104=1568*17 +448=1568*(17 + 0.2857)=

---------------

approximately, but perhaps better to compute 27,104 ÷1568.

Divide numerator and denominator by 16: 27,104/16=1,694; 1568/16=98.

So, 1,694/98=1

---------------

7.2857.

Wait, 98*17=1,666. 1,694-1,666=28. So, 17 +28/98=17 +2/7=17.2857.

So, 27,104/1568=17 +2/7=121/7.

So

---------------

, right side= (121/7)*39,375= (121*39,375)/7.

Compute 39,375 ÷7=5,625.

So, 121*5,625= Let

---------------

's compute:

121*5,000=605,000.

121*625=75,625.

So, total=605,000 +75,625=680,625.

So, right side=680,625.

Now, putting

---------------

 it all together:

First term:677,600 -2,906,000t +3,092,600t².

Second term:+2,822,400t² -184,800t +3,025.

Total

---------------

 left side:677,600 +3,025 + (-2,906,000t -184,800t) + (3,092,600t² +2,822,400t²).

Compute each:

Constants:677,600 +3,025=680,625.

t terms: -2,906,000t -184,800t= -3,090,800t.

t² terms:3,092,600 +2,822,400=5,915,000t².

So, left side=5,915,000t² -3,090,800t +680,625.

Set equal to right side=

---------------

680,625.

So,

5,915,000t² -3,090,800t +680,625=680,625.

Subtract 680,625 from both sides:

5,915,000t² -3,090,800t=0.

Factor t:

t*(5,915,000t -3,090,800)=0.

Solutions: t=0, which corresponds to point A, and 

---------------

5,915,000t -3,090,800=0 → t=3,090,800 /5,915,000.

Simplify the

---------------

 fraction:

Divide numerator and denominator by 100:30,908 /59,150.

Check if they

---------------

 have common factors. Let's see, 30,908 and59,150.

Compute GCD(30,908,59,150).

5

---------------

9,150 ÷30,908=1 with remainder 59,150 -30,908=28,242.

30,908 ÷28,242=1 with remainder 2,666.

28,242 ÷2,666=10 with remainder 28,242 -26,660=1,582.

2,666 ÷1,582=1 with remainder 1,084.

1,582 ÷1,084=1 with remainder 498.

1,084 ÷498=2 with remainder 88.

498 ÷88=5 with remainder 58.

88 ÷58=1 with remainder 30.

58 ÷30=1 with remainder 28.

30 ÷28=1 with remainder 2.

28 ÷2=14 with remainder 0.

So, GCD is 2.

So, divide numerator and denominator by 2:

30,908 ÷2=15,454,

59,150 ÷2=29,575.

So, t=15,454 /29,575.

Check if they

---------------

 can be reduced further.

15,454 and29,575.

Check divisibility by 7: 15,454 ÷7=2,207.714…

---------------

 No.

Check divisibility by 13: 15,454 ÷13=1,188.769… No.

Check

---------------

 29,575 ÷5=5,915. So, 29,575=5*5,915=5*5*1,183. Not

---------------

 sure.

Not obvious. Let me compute GCD(15,454,29,575).

2

---------------

9,575 ÷15,454=1 with remainder 14,121.

15,454 ÷14,121=1 with remainder 1,333.

14,121 ÷1,333=10 with remainder 7

---------------

81.

1,333 ÷781=1 with remainder 552.

781 ÷552=1 with remainder 229.

552 ÷229=2 with remainder 94.

229 ÷94=2 with remainder 31

---------------

.

94 ÷31=3 with remainder 1.

31 ÷1=31 with remainder 0.

So, GCD is 1. Therefore, t=15,454/29,575.

So, t≈0.523.

So

---------------

, point P corresponds to t≈0.523.

But we need exact value.

So, t=15,454/29,575.

S

---------------

implify:

Divide numerator and denominator by GCD which is 1. So, t=15,454/29,575.

Now

---------------

, compute AP.

AP is the distance from A to P along AD.

Parametrize AD: when t=0, we are at A;

---------------

 when t=1, we are at D. So, the length from A to P is t times the length from A to D, but

---------------

 wait, no. Wait, in parametric terms, t is a scaling factor for the direction vector. So, the actual distance is

---------------

 |t| times the length of the direction vector.

Wait, let me think. The parametric equations are:

x=10 + (-235/22)t,

y=0 + (30√14/11)t.

So, the

---------------

 vector from A to D is (-235/22,30√14/11). So, the length of AD is sqrt[ (-235/22)^2 + (30√14/11)^2 ].

Compute this

---------------

:

(-235/22)^2= (235)^2/(22)^2=55,225/484.

(30√14/11)^2=900*14/121=12,600/121.

So, length squared

---------------

=55,225/484 +12,600/121.

Convert to common denominator,

---------------

 484:

55,225/484 + (12,600 *4)/484=55,225/484 +50,400/484=105,625/484.

So, length AD= sqrt(105,625/484)=3

---------------

25/22.

Because sqrt(105,625)=325, sqrt(484)=22.

So, AD=325/22.

So

---------------

, the length from A to P is t * AD, where t=15,454/29,575.

Wait

---------------

, no, wait. Because in the parametrization, t=0 is at A, and t=1 is at D. So, the

---------------

 length from A to P is |t| * AD, but only if the parametrization is normalized by the length. However

---------------

, in our parametrization, the direction vector isn't necessarily a unit vector. So, the actual distance from A to P is t multiplied by the length of the direction vector.

---------------

 Wait, no, because the parametric equations are linear in t, but the direction vector's length is 325/22,

---------------

 as we found.

Wait, actually, in our parametrization, t is a scalar multiple along the vector from A to D. So, when

---------------

 t=1, we reach D, which is 325/22 units away from A. So, the

---------------

 distance from A to P is |t| * (325/22).

But in our case, t is 15,454/29,575,

---------------

 which is less than 1, so AP= t*(325/22).

Compute AP= (15,454/29,575)*(325/22).

Simplify the fraction:

First

---------------

, compute 325/22=14.7727 approximately.

But let's do it fraction

---------------

ally.

15,454 and29,575: GCD is 1.

325 and22: GCD is 13 and 22

---------------

 are coprime.

So, AP= (15,454 *325)/(29,575 *22).

S

---------------

implify numerator and denominator:

First, factor numerator and denominator:

15,454=2*7,727.

7

---------------

,727: let's check divisibility by 7: 7*1,103=7,721, which

---------------

 is less than 7,727. 7,727-7*1,103=6. So, not divisible by7.

Div

---------------

isible by 13: 13*594=7,722. 7,727-7,722=5. Not divisible.

Maybe

---------------

 7,727 is prime? Not sure, but perhaps.

325=5²*13.

29,575=29,575.

---------------

 Let's factor:

29,575 ÷25=1,183. 1,183: check

---------------

 divisibility by 7: 7*169=1,183? 7*160=1,120, 7*9=63,

---------------

 1,120+63=1,183. Yes, 7*169=1,183. But

---------------

 169=13². So, 29,575=25*7*13².

22=2*11.

So, let

---------------

's write all factors:

AP= (2*7,727 *5²*13)/(25*7*13² *2*11).

Simplify:

Cancel 2 in numerator and denominator.

Cancel 5² with

---------------

 25=5².

Cancel 7 in numerator and denominator.

Cancel 13 in numerator and one 13 in denominator (leaving one 13 in denominator).

So, we

---------------

 have:

AP= (7,727 *5²*13)/(25*7*13² *11) → wait

---------------

, let me write it step by step.

Wait, numerator: 2 *7,727 *5² *13.

Denominator:25 *7 *13² *2*11.

Cancel

---------------

 2: numerator and denominator.

Cancel 5² and 25: 5²/25=1/1.

Cancel 7: numerator and denominator.

Cancel 13: numerator and denominator.



---------------

So, remaining:

Numerator:7,727.

Denominator:13 *11.

So, AP=7,727/(13*11)=7,727/143.

Compute

---------------

 7,727 ÷143:

143*54=143*(50+4)=7,150 +572=7,722.

7,727 -7,722=5.

So, 7,727=143*54 +5.

So, 7,727/143=54 +5/143=54 5/143.

But as

---------------

 an improper fraction, it's 54*143 +5=7,722 +5=7,727.

---------------

 So, 7,727/143=54 5/143.

But we can write

---------------

 it as 7,727/143.

Check if 7,727 and143 have common factors.

143=11*13.

7,727 ÷11=702.454… No

---------------

.

7,727 ÷13=594.384… No.

So, 7,727 and143 are coprime?

---------------

 Wait, 7,727 ÷11=702.454… Not integer.

So

---------------

, AP=7,727/143.

Wait, but 7,727 divided by 143:

---------------

 143*54=7,722, remainder 5. So, it's 54 5/143, but as an improper fraction, it's 7,727/143.

But

---------------

 wait, let's double-check the calculation:

AP= (15,454 *325)/(29,575 *22).

We

---------------

 can factor numerator and denominator:

15,454=2*7,727.

325=5²*13.

29,575=25*7*13².

22=2*11.

So,

AP= (2*7,727 *5²*13)/(25*7*13² *2*11).

Cancel 2 in

---------------

 numerator and denominator.

Cancel 5² with 25.

Cancel 7.

Cancel 13.

Remaining:

7

---------------

,727/(13*11)=7,727/143.

Yes, correct.

So, AP=7,727/143.

S

---------------

implify 7,727 ÷143:

143*54=7,722,

---------------

 as before. So, 7,727=143*54 +5.

So, AP=54 +5/143=54 5/143, but as an improper fraction, it's 7,727/143.

Check

---------------

 if 7,727 and143 have any common factors. 143=11*13. 

---------------

7,727 ÷11=702.454… No. 7,727 ÷13=594.384… No. So, 

---------------

7,727 and143 are coprime? Wait, 7,727 ÷11=702.454…

---------------

 Not integer.

Wait, 7,727 ÷11=702.454… Hmm

---------------

, 7,727 ÷11=702.454, but let me compute 11*702=7,722, so

---------------

 7,727-7,722=5. So, 7,727=11*702 +5, so remainder

---------------

 5. So, not divisible by11.

Similarly, 7,727 ÷13: 13*594=7,722, 

---------------

7,727-7,722=5, so remainder 5. So, not divisible by13.

Therefore

---------------

, 7,727 and143 are coprime except for the 143=11*13,

---------------

 which don't divide 7,727. So, the fraction is reduced.

Wait, but 7,727 divided

---------------

 by 143 is 54 with a remainder of 5, so 7,727=143*54 +5.

So

---------------

, 7,727 and143 share no common factors besides 1, so the fraction is 7,727/143, which reduces

---------------

 to 54 5/143, but as an improper fraction, it's 7,727/143.

But 

---------------

7,727/143 can be simplified further? Wait, 7,727 ÷1

---------------

1=702.454, which is not integer. 7,727 ÷13=594.384, not integer. So, no

---------------

, it's irreducible.

Wait, but 7,727 is a prime? Let me check.

Wait, 7,727:

---------------

 Let me test for divisibility by 7: 7*1,103=7,721, which

---------------

 is less than 7,727 by 6. So, not divisible by7.

Divisible by 17: 17*454=7,718, 7,727-7,718=9, not divisible.

Divisible by 19: 19*406=7,714, 7,727-7,714=13, not divisible.

Divisible by 23: 23*336=7,728, which is 

---------------

1 more than 7,727. So, not divisible.

So, 7,727 is likely a prime number.

---------------

 So, the fraction 7,727/143 is in simplest terms, since 143=11*13, and 7,727 isn't divisible by either.

Wait, but 

---------------

7,727 ÷ 17=454.529… Not integer.

7,727 ÷ 7=1,103.857… Not integer.

So, yes

---------------

, 7,727 is prime.

So, AP=7,727/143.

But

---------------

 wait, 7,727 is a large numerator. Let me check the earlier steps to see if I made a mistake

---------------

.

Wait, when I calculated t=15,454/29,575, which is approximately

---------------

 0.523. Then, AP= t*(325/22)= (15,454/29,575)*(325/22)= (

---------------

15,454 *325)/(29,575 *22).

Wait, perhaps I

---------------

 can simplify this fraction before multiplying.

Let me see:

325=5²*13,

29,575=25*7*13²,

22=2*11,

15,454=2*7,727.

So,

AP= (2*7,727 *5²*13)/(25*7*13² *2*11).

Cancel 2:

---------------

 numerator and denominator.

Cancel 5² with25: 5²/25=1.

Cancel 13: numerator and denominator.

So, AP

---------------

= (7,727)/(7*11*13).

Wait, 7*11=77, 77*13=1,001.

So, AP=7,727/1,001.

Wait, that

---------------

's different from what I had earlier. Did I make a mistake in denominator factors?

Wait, denominator is29,575 *22= (25*7*13²)*(2*11)=25*7*13²*2*11.

So

---------------

, denominator=2*25*7*11*13².

Numerator=2*7,727*5²*13.

So,

AP= (2*7,727*5²*13)/(2*25*7*11*13²).

Cancel 2:

---------------

 numerator and denominator.

Cancel 5² with25: 5²/25=1.

Cancel 13: numerator and denominator.

So, AP

---------------

=7,727/(7*11*13).

Compute denominator:7*11=77, 77*13=1,001.

So, AP=7,727/1,001.

Wait

---------------

, that's different from before. So, earlier I must have miscalculated.

So, AP=7,727/1,001.

Now

---------------

, check if 7,727 and1,001 have common factors.

1,001=7*11*13.

7,727 ÷7=1,103.857… Not integer.

7,727 ÷11=702.454… Not integer.

7,727 ÷13=594.384… Not integer.

So, 7,727 and1,001 are coprime.

---------------

 Therefore, AP=7,727/1,001.

But 7,727 is equal

---------------

 to 7*1,103.857, which isn't integer. So, it's reduced.

Wait, but 7,727 �

---------------

�7=1,103.857, which is not integer. So, 7,727 and1,001 are coprime.



---------------

So, AP=7,727/1,001.

But 7,727/1,001 can

---------------

 be simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by GCD(7,727,1,001).

Compute GCD(7,727,1,001):

Use

---------------

 Euclidean algorithm.

7,727 ÷1,001=7, remainder 7,727 -7*1,001=7,727-7,007=720.

Now, GCD(1,001,720).

1,001 ÷720=1, remainder 281.

GCD(720,281).

720 ÷281=2, remainder 720 -2*281=720-562=158.

GCD(281,158).

281 ÷158=1, remainder 123.

GCD(158,123).

158 ÷123=1, remainder35.

GCD(123,35).

123 ÷35=3, remainder 123-3*35=123-105=18.

GCD(35,18).

35 ÷18=1, remainder17.

GCD(18,17).

18 ÷17=1, remainder1.

GCD(17,1)=1.

So, GCD is1. Therefore, 7,727/1,001 is reduced

---------------

.

But wait, 7,727/1,001=7.72 approximately.

Wait, but earlier

---------------

 I thought it was 54 5/143, but that was a miscalculation.

Wait, I

---------------

 think I messed up the parametrization step.

Wait, because in parametrization, t is a parameter, not necessarily the fraction of the length. So, perhaps

---------------

 I should have used the value of t to find the coordinates of P and then compute the distance from A to P.

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps there's a better approach.

Wait, let me consider using inversion or harmonic division, but that might be too advanced.

Alternatively, use

---------------

 the Power of a Point.

Earlier, I had the equation: DP * DA = DB².

If I can compute DB, then I

---------------

 can find DP, and since AP=DA - DP, I can find AP.

So, let's compute DB.

Point D is (-15/22,30√14/11).

Point B is (39/5,6√14/5).

Compute distance DB.

Use

---------------

 distance formula:

DB= sqrt[ (xB -xD)^2 + (yB -yD)^2 ].

Compute xB -xD=39/5 - (-15/22)=39/5 +15/22= (39*22 +15*5)/110= (858 +75)/110=933/110.

yB -yD=6√14/5 -30√14/11= (6√14*11 -30√14*5)/55= (66√14 -150√14)/55= (-84√14)/55.

So,

DB²= (933/110)^2 + (-84√14/55)^2.

Compute each term:

(933/110)^2= (933²)/(110²)=870,489/12,100.

(-84√14/55)^2= (84² *14)/55²= (7,056 *14)/3,025=98,784/3,025.

So, DB²=870,489/12,100 +98,784/3,025.

Convert to common denominator:

---------------

12,100 is 4*3,025.

So, 98,784/3,025= (98,784*4)/12,100=395,136/12,100.

So, DB²=870,489/12,100 +395,136/12,100= (870,489 +395,136)/12,100=1,265,625/12,100.

Simplify:



---------------

1,265,625 ÷25=50,625; 12,100 ÷25=484.

So, 50,625/484.

Check

---------------

 if reducible:

50,625 ÷5=10,125; 484 ÷5=96.8.

---------------

 Not integer.

50,625 ÷11=4,602.27… Not integer.

So, DB²=50,625/484.

Therefore

---------------

, DB= sqrt(50,625/484)=225/22.

Because sqrt(50,625)=225, sqrt(484)=22.

So, DB=225/22.

Earlier

---------------

, we found AD=325/22.

So, from Power of a Point:

DB²=DA * DP.

So,

(225/22)^2= (325/22)*DP.

Compute left

---------------

 side: (225)^2/(22)^2=50,625/484.

So,

50,625/484= (325/22)*DP.

Solve for DP:

DP= (50,625/484)/(325/22)= (50,625/484)*(22/325).

Simplify:

50,625 ÷325=5

---------------

0,625 ÷325=50,625 ÷25=2,025; 2,025 ÷13=155.769… Wait, 

---------------

325=25*13.

So, 50,625 ÷325= (50,625 ÷25) ÷13=2,025 ÷13=155.769… Hmm

---------------

, not integer.

Wait, perhaps factor numerator and denominator:

50,625=225²= (15²)²=15^4.

3

---------------

25=5²*13.

22=2*11.

484=22²=4*121=4*11².

So,

DP= (15^4 / (4*11²)) * (2*11)/(5²*13)).

Simplify:

= (15^4 *2*11)/(4*11² *5²*13).

=

---------------

 (15^4 *2)/(4*11*5²*13).

Simplify 15^4= (3*5)^4=3^4*5^4.

So,

= (3^4*5^4 *2)/(4*11*5²*13).

Cancel 5²:

= (3^4*5² *2)/(4*11*13).

=

---------------

 (81*25*2)/(4*11*13).

= (81*50)/(4*143).

= (4,050)/(572).

Simplify 4,050 ÷2=2,025; 572 ÷2=286.

So, 2,025/286.

Check if reducible:

286=2*11*13.

2,025 ÷11=184.09… No.

2,025 ÷13=155.769… No.

So, DP=2,025/286.

Now

---------------

, AP= DA - DP= (325/22) - (2,025/286).

Convert to common denominator:



---------------

325/22= (325*13)/286=4,225/286.

2,025/286 remains.



---------------

So, AP=4,225/286 -2,025/286=2,200/286.

Simplify:

2,200 ÷2=1,100; 286 ÷2=143.

So, AP=1,100/143.

Check if reducible:

143=11*13.

1,100 ÷11=100; 1,100 ÷13≈84.615… Not integer.

So, AP=1,100/143.

Simplify:



---------------

1,100 ÷11=100; 143 ÷11=13.

So, 1,100/143=100/13.

Wait, 

---------------

143*100=14,300. Wait, no, 143*100=14,300,

---------------

 but 1,100 is 11*100. So, 1,100/143= (11*100)/(11*13)=100/13.

Ah

---------------

, so AP=100/13.

So, AP=100/13.

Which is in

---------------

 simplest terms, since 100 and13 are coprime.

So, m=100, n=13. m

---------------

 +n=113.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{113}


Given triangle \(ABC\) with sides \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\), we need to find the length of \(AP\) where \(P\) is the intersection of line \(AD\) with the circumcircle \(\omega\) of \(ABC\). 

First, we compute the circumradius \(R\) of triangle \(ABC\). Using Heron's formula, the area \(\Delta\) of triangle \(ABC\) is found to be \(6\sqrt{14}\). The circumradius \(R\) is calculated as:
\[
R = \frac{abc}{4\Delta} = \frac{9 \times 10 \times 5}{4 \times 6\sqrt{14}} = \frac{450}{24\sqrt{14}} = \frac{75\sqrt{14}}{56}
\]

Next, we find the coordinates of points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\). Placing \(C\) at the origin \((0,0)\), \(A\) at \((10,0)\), and \(

---------------

B\) at \((39/5, 6\sqrt{14}/5)\), we determine the circumcenter \(O\) and

---------------

 the equation of the circumcircle \(\omega\).

The tangents at \(B\) and \(C\) intersect at point \(D\). Using coordinate geometry, we find the coordinates of \(D\) as \((-15/22, 30\sqrt{14}/11)\).

We then find the equation of line \(AD\) and solve

---------------

 for its intersection with the circumcircle \(\omega\). Using the power of a point theorem, we know that \(DB^2 = DA \times DP\). Calculating \(DB\) and \(DA\), we find:
\[
DB = \frac{225}{22}, \quad DA = \frac{325}{22}
\]
Using the power of a point theorem:
\[
DB^2 = DA \times DP \implies \left(\frac{225}{22}\right)^2 = \frac{325}{22} \times DP \implies DP = \frac{2025}{286}
\]
Finally, we find \(AP\) as:
\[
AP = DA - DP = \frac{325}{22} - \frac{2025}{286} = \frac{1100}{143} = \frac{100}{13}
\]
Thus, \(AP = \frac{100}{13}\), and the sum of the numerator and denominator is \(100 + 13 = 113\).

\[
\boxed{113}
