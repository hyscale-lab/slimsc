Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break

---------------

 it down step by step. 

First, the problem says there are 900 residents in total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. So

---------------

, candy hearts are universal—everybody has that. Then, there are other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades. The

---------------

 numbers are 195 owning a diamond ring, 367 owning golf clubs, and 562 owning a garden spade. 

Wait

---------------

, but hold on. The total number of people is 900, but each person owns at least a candy heart. So, when

---------------

 they talk about people owning other things, they're in addition to the candy hearts. But the candy hearts are already included for

---------------

 everyone. 

The problem then states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. We

---------------

're supposed to find how many own all four. Hmm. So, all four would be those who have the candy hearts plus the other three items.



---------------

Wait, but wait again. Wait, the candy hearts are owned by everyone, so when it says someone owns exactly two of these things, does that mean two

---------------

 of the other items plus the candy hearts? Or does it mean exactly two among all four, including candy hearts? Hmm, that

---------------

's a critical point. 

Let me think. The way the problem is phrased: "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, the

---------------

 candy hearts are a given for everyone. Then, the other three items are additional. So, when it says someone owns exactly two of these things, I

---------------

 think it's referring to the other three things, not including candy hearts. Because otherwise, if you include candy hearts, then

---------------

 everyone already has at least one, and you can't have exactly two without considering candy hearts. 

But wait, the problem

---------------

 says "exactly two of these things." The way it's written, the things are the four: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. So

---------------

, does "exactly two" include the candy hearts? Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. Let me read the problem again.



---------------

It says, "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, the candy hearts are a

---------------

 separate thing. Then, it mentions the number of people owning diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. Then, it says,

---------------

 "there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things." 



---------------

So, the "these things" here would refer to the four: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. Because

---------------

 that's what was just mentioned. So, if someone owns exactly two of these, that includes the possibility of having the candy hearts plus

---------------

 one other. Wait, but that would mean that each person owns at least the candy hearts, so "exactly two" would mean

---------------

 two things in total, including the candy hearts. So, for example, someone could have the candy hearts and a diamond ring—

---------------

so exactly two. Or the candy hearts and a golf club, etc. 

Wait, but that complicates things. Because in

---------------

 that case, the number of people owning exactly two of these four items would include those who have the candy hearts plus one other. Similarly

---------------

, exactly three would include those who have the candy hearts plus two others, and so on. 

But maybe another approach is to model this using the

---------------

 principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's try that. 

Let me denote the sets as follows:
- Let D be the set of people owning a diamond ring.
- Let G be the set of people owning golf clubs.
- Let S be the set of people owning a garden spade.
- Let C be the set of people owning candy hearts. Since

---------------

 everyone owns this, C is the universal set with 900 elements.

We are given:
- |D| = 195
- |G| = 367
- |S| = 562
- |C| = 900


---------------

- Number of people owning exactly two of these four items: 437
- Number owning exactly three: 234
- We need to find the number owning all four: |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|, which is the same as |D ∩ G ∩ S| since C is universal.

Wait, but

---------------

 since C is universal, any intersection that includes C is just the intersection of the other sets. So, for example, D ∩ C is just D, since

---------------

 everyone has C. So, if someone is in D ∩ C, they're just in D. So, in this

---------------

 case, the number of people who own exactly two of the four items would include people who have, say, D and G but not S or C?

---------------

 Wait, no, because C is already included in everyone. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.

Wait, perhaps it

---------------

's better to model this as four sets where C is the universal set. So, when considering the other three sets (D, G, S), each

---------------

 is a subset of C. So, for inclusion-exclusion, we can think about the union of D, G, S within

---------------

 C.

But the problem is about the counts of people owning exactly two or exactly three of the four items, which include C. Wait

---------------

, no, because C is owned by everyone. So, if someone owns exactly two of the four, it must include C plus

---------------

 one of the other three. Because if they don't have C, that's impossible—they all have C. So, exactly

---------------

 two would be C plus one other item. Similarly, exactly three would be C plus two others, and exactly four would be all four,

---------------

 which is C plus the other three.

Wait, but that seems to fit. So, let me try to model it this

---------------

 way.

Let me denote:
- a = number of people with exactly D and C (so only D and C)
- b = exactly G and C
- c = exactly S and C
- d = exactly D and G and C
- e = exactly D and S and C
- f = exactly G and S and C
- g = exactly D, G, S, and C (so

---------------

 all four)

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says that 437 own exactly two of the four things

---------------

, and 234 own exactly three. So, the exactly two would be a + b + c. The exactly three would be d + e + f. And the exactly four is g. 



---------------

But wait, in this model, a, b, c are exactly two, each including C. Similarly, d, e, f are exactly three, including C. And g is all four.

Now

---------------

, the total number of people in each category is 437 exactly two, 234 exactly three, and we

---------------

're looking for g, the exactly four. But wait, the problem says that these are the only possibilities? Or are there people who own only

---------------

 C? Because the problem says each of the 900 owns a bag of candy hearts, so everyone is in C. But the

---------------

 other items are optional. So, some people might own only C, some might own C and one other, C and two others, etc. 



---------------

Wait, the problem says that 437 own exactly two of the four, 234 own exactly three, and we're

---------------

 to find the number who own all four. But that doesn't account for everyone. Because there might be people who own only C,

---------------

 and not any of the other three. So, the total would be:

Number of people owning only C + exactly two (437) + exactly three (234) + exactly four (g) = 900.

Wait

---------------

, but the problem doesn't mention the number of people owning only C. Hmm, but perhaps that's something we can calculate

---------------

. Because if we know the total number in each category, we can find that.

Alternatively, maybe using inclusion-exclusion for

---------------

 the three sets D, G, S within the universal set C. Let's think about that.

The inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

But since

---------------

 C is the universal set, |D ∪ G ∪ S| is equal to the number of people who own at least one of D, G, or S. But

---------------

 wait, everyone owns C, but not everyone owns D, G, or S. So, the number of people who don't own D, G, or S is equal

---------------

 to the number of people who own only C. Let's denote that as x. So, x = 900 - |D ∪ G ∪ S|.

But

---------------

 I don't know if that's helpful yet. Let me think about the other approach.

We know the number of people in each category

---------------

: exactly two, exactly three, exactly four, and only C. Let's denote:

- Only C: x
- Exactly two: a + b + c = 437
- Exactly three: d + e + f = 234
- Exactly four: g = ?

So

---------------

, x + 437 + 234 + g = 900.

So, x + g = 900 - (437 + 234) = 900 - 671 = 229.

So, x + g = 229.

Now

---------------

, we need another equation to relate x and g.

Let me think about how to compute |D|, |G|, |S| in terms of the other

---------------

 variables. Because each of |D|, |G|, |S| can be expressed as the sum of people who have only D, those

---------------

 who have D and another item, etc.

So, for example, |D| is the number of people who have D. These

---------------

 include:

- a (only D and C)
- d (D, G, and C)
- e (D, S, and C)
- g (all four)



---------------

Similarly, |G| includes:

- b (only G and C)
- d (D, G, C)
- f (G, S, C)
- g

And |S| includes:

- c (only S and C)
- e (D, S, C)
- f (G, S, C)
- g

So, we

---------------

 can write:

|D| = a + d + e + g = 195

|G| = b + d + f + g = 367

|S| = c + e + f + g = 562

We

---------------

 also know that a + b + c = 437 (exactly two items, including C)

And d + e + f = 234 (exactly three items, including C)

We

---------------

 have these three equations:

1. a + d + e + g = 195
2. b + d + f + g = 367
3. c + e + f + g = 562

And we

---------------

 have:

a + b + c = 437 (exactly two)
d + e + f = 234 (exactly three)

Also

---------------

, x + g = 229 (from earlier)

We have 6 variables: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and x. Wait, that

---------------

's seven variables. But we have more equations. Let me count:

We have the three equations from |D|, |G|, |S|.



---------------

Then, we have a + b + c = 437

d + e + f = 234

And x + g = 229.

Wait

---------------

, that's 5 equations, and variables are a, b, c, d, e, f, g, x. That

---------------

's 8 variables. Hmm, maybe I'm missing another equation. Alternatively, perhaps I can find another relation.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 we can sum the three equations from |D|, |G|, |S|.

Summing equations 1, 2, 3:

(a + d + e + g) + (b + d + f + g) + (c + e + f + g) = 195 + 367 + 562

Left

---------------

 side: a + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f + 3g

Right side: 195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124?

---------------

 Wait, no: 195 + 367 is 562, plus 562 is 1124.

Wait, 

---------------

195 + 367 = 562? Wait, 195 + 367: 195 + 300 is 495, plus 67 is 562. Yes. Then 

---------------

562 + 562 is 1124.

So, the sum is 1124.

So

---------------

, left side: (a + b + c) + 2*(d + e + f) + 3g = 1124

We know that a + b + c = 437, and d + e + f = 234.

So, substituting:

437 + 2*(234) + 3g = 1124

Compute

---------------

 2*234: 468

So, 437 + 468 = 905

Then

---------------

, 905 + 3g = 1124

Subtract 905 from both sides: 3g = 1124 - 905 = 219

So, 3g = 219 → g = 73.

So

---------------

, the number of residents who own all four things is 73.

Wait, let me verify that. So, 

---------------

3g = 219 → g = 73. 

Then, from x + g = 229, x = 229 -73 = 156.

So, 

---------------

156 people own only C, and 73 own all four.

Does this make sense? Let me check the

---------------

 equations.

We can plug g =73 into the three initial equations.

Equation 1: a + d + e +73 = 195 → a + d + e = 122

Equation 2: b + d + f +73 =367 → b + d + f =294

Equation3: c + e + f +73=562 → c + e + f=489

We

---------------

 also know that d + e + f =234.

So, from equation 2: b + (d + e + f) =294 → b + 234 =294 → b=60.

From equation 1: a + (d + e) =122.

---------------

 But d + e =234 - f.

Hmm, perhaps it's getting too detailed, but since the calculations led us to g=73, which seems

---------------

 consistent, I think that's the answer.


To solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and analyze

---------------

 the given data step by step.

We denote:
- \( |D| = 195 \) (diamond ring owners),
- \( |G| = 367 \) (golf clubs owners),
- \( |S| = 562 \) (garden spade owners),
- \( |C| = 900 \) (candy hearts owners, universal set),
- 437 residents own exactly two of the four items,
- 234 residents own exactly three of the four items.

Let:
- \( a, b, c \) be the number of residents owning exactly two items (including

---------------

 candy hearts),
- \( d, e, f \) be the number owning exactly three items (including candy hearts),
- \( g \) be the number owning all four items.

From

---------------

 the problem, we have:
- \( a + b + c = 437 \),
- \( d + e + f = 234 \).

The total number of residents is:
\[ x + 437 + 234 + g = 900 \]
where \( x \) is the number of residents owning only candy hearts. Simplifying:
\[ x + g = 229 \]

Using the inclusion-exclusion principle for \( |D|, |G|, |S| \), we write:
\[ |D| + |G| + |S| = (a + d + e + g) + (b + d + f + g) + (c + e + f + g) \]
\[ 195 + 367 + 562 = (a + b + c) + 2(d + e + f) + 3g \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ 1124 = 437 + 2(234) + 3g \]
\[ 1124 = 437 + 468 + 3g \]
\[ 1124 = 905 + 3g \]
\[ 3g = 219 \]
\[ g = 73 \]

Thus, the number of residents owning all four items is \(

---------------

 \boxed{73} \).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
