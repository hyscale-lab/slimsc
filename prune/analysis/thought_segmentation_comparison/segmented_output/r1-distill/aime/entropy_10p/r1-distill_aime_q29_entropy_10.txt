Okay, so I have this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, okay.

First, I remember that roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy ω^n = 1 for some integer n. Since ω is a 13th root of unity and ω ≠ 1, it must be one of the primitive 13th roots. That means ω^k for k from 0 to 12 will cycle

---------------

 through all the 13th roots of unity. But wait, when k=0, ω^0 is 1, right

---------------

? So in the product, when k=0, the term becomes 2 - 2*1 + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So that term is just 1. So

---------------

 maybe I can ignore k=0 since it doesn't affect the product? Or maybe it's better to include it because the

---------------

 product is from k=0 to 12.

But let me think about the structure of the product. The product is over all

---------------

 k from 0 to 12, each term being (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). I

---------------

 wonder if there's a way to simplify this expression or relate it to known polynomials or properties of roots of unity.

Let

---------------

 me denote each term as f(ω^k) where f(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2. So each

---------------

 term is f(ω^k). So the product is the product of f(ω^k) for k=0 to 12.

Wait

---------------

, but since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, the set {ω^k | k=0,1,...,12} are all the 13th roots of unity. So the

---------------

 product over k=0 to 12 of f(ω^k) is the same as the product over all 13th roots of unity x

---------------

 of f(x). Hmm, but in that case, I might be able to use the fact that the product over all roots of a polynomial evaluated

---------------

 at a function can be related to the resultant or something like that.

I remember that for a polynomial P(x), the product over all roots α of P(x) of (x - α) is just P(x). But in

---------------

 this case, the product is over f(α) where α are the roots of x^13 - 1 = 0.

---------------

 So the product is the product of (2 - 2α + α^2) for each root α of x^13 - 1.



---------------

Wait, but maybe I can relate this to another polynomial. Let me think: if I have a polynomial Q(x) whose

---------------

 roots are the α^2, then maybe f(α) = 2 - 2α + α^2 can

---------------

 be related to Q(x). Alternatively, perhaps I can manipulate f(x) into a different form.

Let me write f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. So

---------------

 f(x) is a quadratic. Hmm, maybe factor it? Let's see if it factors.

The discriminant is b

---------------

² - 4ac = 4 - 8 = -4. So it factors into (x - [1 + i])(x - [1 - i]). So

---------------

 f(x) = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

So the product becomes the product over all 13th roots of unity α of (α - (1 + i))(α - (1 - i)).

Wait

---------------

, so that would be the product over α of (α - (1 + i)) times the product over α of (α - (1 - i)). Because

---------------

 each term is a product of two factors, so I can split the product into two separate products.

So the entire product is equal to [product over α of (α - (1 + i))] * [product over α of (α - (1 - i))].

But now

---------------

, what is the product over all 13th roots of unity α of (x - α)? That's just the polynomial x^13 - 1, since

---------------

 the roots are exactly the 13th roots of unity. So the product over α of (x - α) = x^13 - 1.

Therefore

---------------

, the product over α of (α - (1 + i)) is equal to (1 + i)^13 - 1. Similarly, the product over α of (α - (1 - i)) is equal to (1 - i)^13 - 1.

Wait, let

---------------

 me check that: If I set x = 1 + i, then the product becomes (1 + i)^13 - 1. Similarly

---------------

 for x = 1 - i.

So the total product is [(1 + i)^13 - 1] * [(1 - i)^13 - 1].

So

---------------

 now, I need to compute this expression and then find the remainder when divided by 1000.

But first, let's compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.

I remember that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(2), and the argument is π/4. So (1 + i) = sqrt(2) * e^{iπ/4}.

Similarly, (1 - i) = sqrt(2) * e^{-iπ/4}.

So raising

---------------

 to the 13th power:

(1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * π/4}.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13 * π/4}.

Let

---------------

 me compute (sqrt(2))^13. Since sqrt(2) = 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).

Now

---------------

, the exponents: e^{i * 13π/4} and e^{-i * 13π/4}.

But 13π/4 is equal

---------------

 to 3π + π/4, which is the same as π/4 beyond 3π, which is equivalent

---------------

 to π/4 beyond π, since angles are modulo 2π. So 13π/4 - 2π = 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4. Similarly, -

---------------

13π/4 is equivalent to -13π/4 + 4π = -13π/4 + 16π/4 = 3π/4.

Wait, let

---------------

 me check: 13π/4 divided by 2π is 13/8, which is 1 and 5/8. So subtracting 2π once gives

---------------

 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4. So e^{i * 13π/4} = e^{i * 5π/4}.

Similarly, e^{-i * 13π/4} = e^{-i * (3π/4)}. Because e

---------------

^{-i * 13π/4} = e^{-i*(3π/4 + 2π)} = e^{-i*3π/4}.



---------------

Wait, actually, let me compute it step by step.

13π/4 is equal to 3π + π/4. So

---------------

 3π is π more than 2π, so 13π/4 is the same as 13π/4 - 2π = 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4. So e

---------------

^{i * 13π/4} = e^{i * 5π/4}.

Similarly, e

---------------

^{-i * 13π/4} = e^{-i*(5π/4)}.

Wait, but 

---------------

5π/4 is in the third quadrant, and 3π/4 is in the second. Hmm, but perhaps

---------------

 it's easier to just compute the trigonometric functions.

So, e^{i * 5π/4} = cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.

Similarly, e^{-i * 5π/4} = cos(5π/4) - i sin(5π/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2.

So

---------------

, let's compute (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].

Wait

---------------

, let's compute this step by step.

First, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 5π/4} = (2^{1/2})^13 * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].

Compute

---------------

 (sqrt(2))^13:

sqrt(2) = 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).

So,

---------------

 (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].

Multiply

---------------

 64 * sqrt(2) by each term inside the brackets.

First term: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (- (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 ) = 64 * (- (2)/2 ) = 64 * (-1) = -64.

Second term: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64 * (-i * (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 ) = 64 * (-i * 2 / 2 ) = 64 * (-i) = -64i.

So (1 + i)^13 = (-64) + (-64i) = -64(1 + i).

Similarly, (

---------------

1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 5π/4} = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ].

Compute

---------------

 this:

64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = same as before, -64.

64 * sqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64 * (i * 2 / 2 ) = 64i.

So (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i = -64(1 - i).

So

---------------

 now, going back to the product:

Product = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] = [ (-64(1 + i) ) - 1 ] * [ (-64(1 - i) ) - 1 ].

Let

---------------

 me compute each bracket separately.

First bracket: (-64(1 + i) ) - 1 = -64 - 64i - 1 = (-65) - 64i.

Second bracket: (-64(1 - i) ) - 1 = -64 + 64i - 1 = (-65) + 64i.

So now, the

---------------

 product is (-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i). That's a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's equal to (-65)^2 + (64)^2.

Compute that: (-65)^2 = 4225, (64)^2 = 4096. So total

---------------

 is 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

Wait, let me double-check:



---------------

4225 + 4096: 4000 + 4000 = 8000, 225 + 96 = 321. So 8000 + 321 = 8321. Yep

---------------

.

So the product is 8321.

But wait, the original product was from k=0 to 12, which

---------------

 included k=0. When k=0, the term was 2 - 2*1 + 1 = 1, so

---------------

 the entire product is 8321. But wait, is that correct?

Wait, no, because in my earlier

---------------

 reasoning, I considered all 13th roots of unity, including 1 (when k=0). So the product over

---------------

 all 13th roots of f(α) is 8321. But wait, in the original problem, the

---------------

 product is over k=0 to 12, which includes all 13th roots of unity, so yes, it

---------------

's correct.

So the product is 8321. Now, I need to find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000.

So

---------------

 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. Because 8*1000=8000, and 8321 - 8000 = 321.

Therefore

---------------

, the remainder is 321.

Wait, but let me confirm that 8321 is indeed the correct value.

---------------

 Let me retrace the steps.

We started by writing f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2, fact

---------------

ored as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

Then, the product over all 13th roots α of f(α) is equal

---------------

 to product over α of (α - (1 + i))(α - (1 - i)) = [product over α (α - (1 + i)) ] * [product over α (α - (1 - i)) ].

Then

---------------

, each product is the evaluation of the polynomial x^13 - 1 at x = (1 + i) and x = (1 - i), respectively

---------------

.

So, (x^13 - 1) evaluated at x = (1 + i) is (1 + i)^13 - 1, and same for (1 - i).

We

---------------

 computed (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i), so (1 + i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 + i) - 1 = -65 - 64i.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 - 1 = -65 + 64i.

Multiplying these two

---------------

 gives (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

Yes

---------------

, that seems correct. So the product is 8321, and mod 1000 is 321.

Wait

---------------

 a second, but 8321 mod 1000 is 321? Let me confirm:

---------------

 1000*8 = 8000, 8321 - 8000 = 321. Yes

---------------

, correct.

So the remainder is 321.
</think>

The product is computed by recognizing it as the product of evaluations of a quadratic polynomial at all 13th roots of unity. By

---------------

 expressing the quadratic as a product of linear factors involving complex numbers, we relate the product to evaluations of a polynomial at those points. After

---------------

 calculating these evaluations and simplifying, the product is found to be 8321. The remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321.
