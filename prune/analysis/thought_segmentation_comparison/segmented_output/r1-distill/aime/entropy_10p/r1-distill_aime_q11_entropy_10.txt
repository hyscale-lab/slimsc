Okay, so I've got this problem here about a 2x3 grid where each cell is a digit. The goal is to find

---------------

 how many ways we can fill the grid such that two conditions are met:

1. The sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999.
2. The sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99.

Hmm

---------------

, let me try to visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so there are two rows and three columns. Each

---------------

 cell is a digit, meaning it can be from 0 to 9. 

Let me denote the grid as follows:

\

---------------

[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\ \hline
d & e & f \\ \hline
\end{array}
\]

So, the first

---------------

 number formed by reading left to right in the top row would be the three-digit number abc. Similarly, the bottom row would

---------------

 form def. The sum of these two numbers is 999.

So, mathematically, the first condition is:
abc

---------------

 + def = 999.

The second condition is about the columns. Each column, read top to bottom, forms a two-digit number. So, the first column is ad, the second is be, and the third is cf. Their sum should be 99.

So, the second condition is:
ad + be + cf = 99.

I

---------------

 need to find the number of possible assignments of digits a, b, c, d, e, f (each from 0 to 9) that satisfy both conditions

---------------

.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's tackle the first condition: abc + def = 999.

Since

---------------

 abc and def are both three-digit numbers, their sum is 999. Let's think about the maximum and minimum possible sums. The smallest sum

---------------

 would be 000 + 000 = 0, and the largest would be 999 + 999 = 1998. But

---------------

 here, the sum is fixed at 999, which is exactly 1000 - 1. Hmm

---------------

, that might be a clue.

Wait, if abc + def = 999, then def = 999 - abc. Since

---------------

 both abc and def are three-digit numbers, their possible ranges are 000 to 999. So, def

---------------

 must also be a three-digit number, which it is because we're subtracting from 999.

But wait, if

---------------

 abc is 000, then def would be 999. If abc is 999, then def would be 000. So, abc

---------------

 can range from 000 to 999, and def would correspondingly range from 999 down to 000.

But

---------------

 wait, each digit is from 0 to 9, so let's think about each digit's place.

Let me consider

---------------

 the addition digit by digit, starting from the units place.

So, when adding abc and def, we can think of it as:

 

---------------

 a b c
+ d e f
-------
  9 9 9

Let me write this as:

-

---------------

 Units place: c + f = 9 or 19 (if there's a carryover from the tens place)
- Tens place: b + e + carryover = 9 or 19
- Hundreds place: a + d + carryover = 9

Wait, but

---------------

 since the sum is 999, which is a three-digit number with no thousands place, the maximum possible sum in

---------------

 each digit without carryover is 9. But when adding two digits, the maximum is 9 + 9 = 18, which would

---------------

 produce a carryover of 1.

Let me break it down:

Starting from the units digit:

1. Units place: c + f =

---------------

 9 or 19
   - If c + f = 9, then there's no carryover to the tens place.
   - If c + f = 19, then

---------------

 we carryover 1 to the tens place.

2. Tens place: b + e + carryover (from units) = 9 or 19
   - Similarly

---------------

, if the sum is 9, no carryover to the hundreds place.
   - If the sum is 19, carryover 1 to the hundreds place.

3. Hundreds place: a + d + carryover (from tens) = 9
   - Since

---------------

 the total sum in hundreds place is 9, and the maximum possible without carryover is 9 + 9 = 18. But since

---------------

 we can have a carryover from the tens place, which is either 0 or 1.

Wait, so in the hundreds place,

---------------

 a + d + carryover_from_tens = 9.

But since a and d are digits (0-9), the

---------------

 sum a + d can be from 0 to 18. But with the carryover from the tens place, the

---------------

 total is 9.

So, let's think about the possible cases.

Case 1: No carryover from tens place to

---------------

 hundreds place.

Then, a + d = 9.

Case 2: There is a carryover of 1 from the tens place.

Then, a + d + 1 = 9 →

---------------

 a + d = 8.

So, now let's consider the tens place:

The tens place sum (b + e + carryover_from_units) must

---------------

 be either 9 or 19.

Wait, but in the hundreds place, if there's a carryover, it

---------------

's either 0 or 1. So, in the tens place, the sum could be 9 (no carryover) or 19 (carryover 1).

---------------

 But wait, 19 would require that in the hundreds place, the sum is a + d + 1 = 9,

---------------

 which would require a + d = 8.

Similarly, if the tens place sum is 9, then the carryover is 0, so

---------------

 a + d must equal 9.

So, the tens place can either be 9 or 19, and the

---------------

 hundreds place depends on that.

Similarly, the units place can be 9 or 19, leading to a carryover into

---------------

 the tens place.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe it's better to model this with equations.

Let me denote:

Let C

---------------

 be the carryover from units to tens: C = 0 if c + f < 10, else C = 1.

Let T be the carryover from tens to hundreds: T = 0 if (b + e + C) < 10, else T = 1.

Then, from

---------------

 the hundreds place:

a + d + T = 9.

So, a + d = 9 - T.

Since

---------------

 a and d are digits (0-9), their sum can be 9 or 8.

So, two possibilities:

1. T = 0 ⇒

---------------

 a + d = 9
2. T = 1 ⇒ a + d = 8

Now, moving to the tens place:

b

---------------

 + e + C = 9 + 10*T'

Wait, but in the hundreds place, T is the carryover from the tens, so:



---------------

In the tens place, sum S = b + e + C.

If S < 10, then T = 0;

---------------

 else, T = 1.

But in our case, from the hundreds place, we have either T = 0 or 1.

So

---------------

, for the tens place:

If T = 0 (from hundreds), then S = b + e + C = 9.



---------------

If T = 1 (from hundreds), then S = b + e + C = 19.

Wait, but

---------------

 19 is possible only if b + e + C = 19, which would require that b and e are both

---------------

 9, and C is 1.

But let me think: For T=1, S must be 19,

---------------

 which is only possible if b=9, e=9, and C=1.

Because 9 + 9 + 1 = 19.

Similarly

---------------

, if T=0, then S = 9, which can be achieved in multiple ways.

So, let's structure

---------------

 the problem.

First, the hundreds place:

Case 1: a + d = 9, T = 0.

Case

---------------

 2: a + d = 8, T = 1.

Now, for each case, let's look at the tens place.

Case 1: T = 0 ⇒

---------------

 S = b + e + C = 9.

But S is the sum in the tens place, which can be 

---------------

9 or 19.

Wait, no, because T is 0, so the sum in the tens place is 9,

---------------

 meaning no carryover to the hundreds place.

But wait, in the hundreds place, T is the carryover from the tens,

---------------

 so if T=0, then the sum in the tens place (b + e + C) must be less than 10. So

---------------

, S = b + e + C < 10.

But wait, from the hundreds place, the sum is 9,

---------------

 so a + d + T = 9.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, the hundreds place equation

---------------

 is:

a + d + T = 9.

So, if T is 0, a + d = 9.

If T is 1, a + d = 8.

But

---------------

 in the tens place, the sum is:

b + e + C = 10*T + 9.

Wait, no

---------------

, because the total sum is 999, so the hundreds place is 9, tens place is 9, units place is 9.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I should model the addition digit by digit with carries.

Let me write the addition vertically:

  a b c
+ d e f
--------


---------------

  9 9 9

So, starting from the units place:

c + f = 9 + 10*k1, where k1 is the carryover to the tens place (0 or 1).

Then, moving

---------------

 to the tens place:

b + e + k1 = 9 + 10*k2, where k2 is the carryover to the hundreds place (0 or 1).

Then, moving

---------------

 to the hundreds place:

a + d + k2 = 9.

So, from the hundreds place: a + d + k2 = 9.

So

---------------

, possible values:

k2 can be 0 or 1.

If k2=0: a + d =9.

If k2=1: a + d=8.

Now

---------------

, in the tens place: b + e + k1 =9 +10*k2.

So, depending on k2, which

---------------

 is either 0 or 1, the equation changes.

If k2=0: Then, b + e + k1 =9.

If

---------------

 k2=1: Then, b + e +k1=19.

Because 9 +10*1=19.

Similarly

---------------

, in the units place: c + f =9 +10*k1.

So, k1 can be 0 or 1.

So

---------------

, let's consider all possible combinations of k1 and k2.

Possible combinations:

1. k1=0, k2=0



---------------

2. k1=0, k2=1

3. k1=1, k2=0

4. k1=1, k2=1

But

---------------

 we need to check which of these are possible.

First, let's see if all four combinations are possible.

Case 1: k1=0, k2=0.

Then

---------------

:

From units: c + f =9.

From tens: b + e +0 =9 → b + e=9.

From hundreds: a + d +0=9 → a + d=9.

Case

---------------

 2: k1=0, k2=1.

From units: c + f=9.

From tens: b + e +0=19 → b + e=19.

But b and e are digits, maximum 

---------------

9 each. So, 9 +9=18 <19. So, this case is impossible.

Case 3: k1=1, k2=0.

From units: c + f=19 →

---------------

 c +f=19.

But digits go up to 9, so c=9, f=10?

---------------

 No, f can't be 10. So, c + f=19 is impossible. So, this case is invalid.

Case 4: k1=1, k2=1.

From units: c + f=19,

---------------

 which is impossible as above.

So, only Case 1 is possible.

Wait, so the only valid case is k1=0, k2=0.

Which

---------------

 gives:

c + f=9,

b + e=9,

a + d=9.

So, that simplifies things a

---------------

 bit. So, all the digit pairs in the same column (a & d, b & e, c & f) must sum to 9.

Wait

---------------

, that's an interesting observation. So, each column's top and bottom digits add up to 9. Because a + d=9, b + e=9, c + f=9.

So

---------------

, each column is a pair of digits that add to 9.

Therefore, the grid is such that:

a + d =9,

b + e=9,

c + f=9.

So

---------------

, in each column, the two digits add to 9. That's a key insight.

So, the grid can be thought

---------------

 of as each column being a pair of digits (x, 9 -x). So, for each column, once we

---------------

 choose the top digit, the bottom digit is determined as 9 minus the top digit.

But wait, is that necessarily the case?

Wait

---------------

, no, because for example, in the example given:

Top row: 0 0 8

Bottom row:9 9 1

So

---------------

, the first column:0 +9=9,

Second column:0 +9=9,

Third column:8 +1=9.

So, yes

---------------

, each column's digits add up to 9.

So, that's a necessary condition. So, this gives us a

---------------

 structure to work with.

So, given that, let's consider that in each column, the two digits add to 9.

So

---------------

, for each column, the top digit can be from 0 to9, and the bottom digit is 9 - top digit.

But

---------------

 wait, digits are 0-9, so 9 - top digit must also be a digit (0-9). So, if

---------------

 the top digit is 0, the bottom is 9; if top is 9, bottom is 0.

So, for

---------------

 each column, the pair is (x, 9 -x), where x is the top digit (0-9).

So

---------------

, now, the second condition is about the sum of the three two-digit numbers formed by the columns.

Each column is a two-digit number:

---------------

 first column is ad, second is be, third is cf.

Sum: ad + be + cf =99.

But

---------------

 since a + d =9, b + e=9, c + f=9, each column's two-digit number is 

---------------

10*a + d, which is 10*a + (9 -a) =9*a +9.

Similarly, for

---------------

 the second column:10*b + e=10*b + (9 -b)=9*b +9.

Third column:10*c + f=10*c + (9 -c)=9*c +9.

So, each

---------------

 column's two-digit number is 9*(digit) +9.

So, the sum ad + be + cf = (9a +9) + (9b +9) + (9c +9) =9(a + b + c) + 27.

And

---------------

 this sum is equal to 99.

So, 9(a + b + c) +27 =99.

Let me write that equation:

9(a + b + c) +27 =99.

Subtract 27 from both sides:

9(a + b + c) =72.

Divide both sides by9:

a + b + c =8.

So, the sum of the top row digits a, b, c must be 8.

Therefore

---------------

, the problem reduces to finding the number of possible assignments of a, b, c, d, e, f such that:

1. a + d =9,

2. b + e=9,

3. c + f=9,

4. a + b + c =8.

So

---------------

, now, since d=9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c.

So, the

---------------

 variables a, b, c can be chosen freely such that a + b + c=8, with a, b, c each

---------------

 between 0 and9, inclusive.

But since a, b, c are digits, each can be 0-9.

So

---------------

, the problem now is to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8, where a, b, c are each

---------------

 between 0 and9.

Wait, but since 8 is less than 3*9=27, and each

---------------

 variable is at most 9, the constraints are automatically satisfied because the maximum any of a, b, c can be is 8 when

---------------

 the other two are 0.

So, the number of solutions is the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =8, which is C(8 +3 -1, 3-1)=C(10,2)=45.

Wait, but

---------------

 each variable a, b, c is a digit (0-9), so 8 is less than 9, so no

---------------

 variable exceeds 9. So, all solutions are valid.

So, the number of possible (a, b, c) is

---------------

 45.

But wait, each of a, b, c can be 0-9, so 45 possibilities

---------------

.

Once a, b, c are chosen, d, e, f are determined as 9 -a, 9 -b, 9 -c.

So

---------------

, each of these 45 assignments will give a valid grid that satisfies both conditions.

But wait, is that all? Are

---------------

 there any other constraints?

Wait, let me check the example given:

In the example, the top row is 0,0,8.

---------------

 So, a=0, b=0, c=8. Their sum is 8, which satisfies the condition.

Then

---------------

, d=9, e=9, f=1. So, ad=09, be=09, cf=81. Their

---------------

 sum is 09 +09 +81=99, which is correct.

And the sum of abc=008=

---------------

8, def=991. 8 +991=999, which is correct.

So, that

---------------

's a valid case.

So, each possible (a,b,c) with a + b + c=8 will produce a valid grid.

So

---------------

, the number of grids is equal to the number of such triplets (a,b,c).

Which is 45.

But wait, wait

---------------

 a second.

Wait, the problem is about a 2x3 grid. Each cell is a digit, but the problem

---------------

 didn't specify that leading zeros are allowed or not.

Wait, in the example, the top row is 0 0 8, which is

---------------

 008, which is 8. So, leading zeros are allowed because the sum is 8 +991=999.

Similarly, the bottom

---------------

 row is 9 9 1, which is 991.

So, leading zeros are allowed because the grid

---------------

 is treated as numbers with three digits each, regardless of leading zeros.

So, the numbers can have leading zeros, so all

---------------

 45 possibilities are valid.

Wait, but hold on: is there any possibility that a, b, c could be

---------------

 such that when combined with d, e, f, they form numbers that have leading zeros but are still valid?

Wait, the

---------------

 problem doesn't restrict leading zeros, so each of the numbers abc and def can be from 000 to 999, so

---------------

 leading zeros are allowed.

Therefore, all 45 possibilities are acceptable.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything else.

Wait

---------------

, another thing: the columns are two-digit numbers. In the example, the first column is 0 and9, which is 09. But

---------------

 if a=0, then d=9, so the two-digit number is 09. Similarly, if a=9, d=0, which

---------------

 is 90.

So, the two-digit numbers can have leading zeros because they're formed by the top and bottom digits.

---------------

 So, 09 is a valid two-digit number in this context.

Therefore, all 45 possibilities are valid, leading

---------------

 to 45 possible grids.

Wait, but let me think again: a, b, c are each digits, so

---------------

 their possible values are 0-9. The sum a + b + c=8.

The number of solutions is C

---------------

(8 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(10,2)=45. So, that seems correct.

So

---------------

, the answer is 45.

But wait, wait, I'm a bit confused because the problem says "the sum

---------------

 of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999", which includes abc and def. So, abc

---------------

 and def are both three-digit numbers, which can have leading zeros. So, that's fine.

Similarly, the columns'

---------------

 two-digit numbers can have leading zeros, as in the example, 09.

Therefore, all 45 possibilities are acceptable.

Wait

---------------

, but let me think again: in the example, a=0, b=0, c=8.

But if

---------------

 a=0, then d=9, which is allowed.

But if a=0, then the first column is 09, which is 

---------------

09, a valid two-digit number.

So, yes, all possibilities are acceptable.

Therefore, the number of ways is 45.

Wait

---------------

, but wait, is that all? Because in the problem statement, the grid is 2x3, and each cell is a digit, but

---------------

 the sum conditions are met.

Wait, but I'm getting 45, but maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another

---------------

 way to think about it: since each column must sum to 9, the digits in each column are determined by the top digit. So, for

---------------

 each column, the top digit can be from 0 to9, and the bottom is 9 - top.

But then

---------------

, the sum of the three two-digit numbers is 99.

Wait, but earlier, I found that the sum is

---------------

 9(a +b +c) +27=99, leading to a +b +c=8.

So, the

---------------

 number of possible a, b, c is the number of non-negative integer solutions to a +b +c=8, which is 45.

So

---------------

, that seems correct.

But let me check with another example.

Suppose a=1, b=2, c=5. Their

---------------

 sum is 8.

Then, d=8, e=7, f=4.

So, the grid is:

1 2 5

8 7 4

Then

---------------

, the top row is 125, the bottom is 874. Their sum is 125 +874=999, correct.

The columns are 18, 27, 54.

18 +27=45; 45 +54=99. Correct.

So, that's another valid grid.

Another

---------------

 example: a=8, b=0, c=0.

d=1, e=9, f=9.

Grid:

8 0 0

1 9 9

Top row:800, bottom row:199. Sum:800 +199=999.

Columns:81, 09, 09.

81 +09=90; 90 +09=99.

Yes

---------------

, that works.

Another example: a=4, b=3, c=1.

d=5, e=6, f=8.

Top row:431, bottom row:568. 431 +568=999.

Columns:45, 36, 18. Sum:45 +36=81; 81 +18=99.

Yes

---------------

.

So, all these examples work, and they're all counted in the 45 possibilities.

So, I think my

---------------

 reasoning is correct. Therefore, the number of ways is 45.


The problem involves finding the number of ways to fill a 2x3 grid with digits such that the sum of the two three-digit numbers formed by the rows is 999, and the sum of the three two-digit numbers formed by the columns is 99.

###

---------------

 Key Steps:

1. **Define the Grid:**
   The grid is represented as:
   \[
   \begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
   \hline
   a & b & c \\ \hline
   d & e & f \\ \hline
   \end{array}
   \]
   Here

---------------

, the top row forms the number \(abc\), and the bottom row forms \(def\). The sum \(abc + def = 999\).

2. **Column

---------------

 Constraints:**
   Each column forms a two-digit number: \(ad\), \(be\), and \(cf\). Their sum is \(ad + be + cf = 99\).

3. **Digit

---------------

 Pairing:**
   From the row sum condition, it is deduced that each column's digits must add to 9. Thus:
   \[
   a + d = 9, \quad b + e = 9, \quad c + f = 9
   \]
   This means each column is of the form \((x, 9 - x)\).

4. **Sum of Top Row Digits:**
   The sum of the two-digit column numbers is given

---------------

 by:
   \[
   ad + be + cf = 99
   \]
   Substituting the column forms:
   \[
   (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99
   \]
   Simplifying using \(d = 9 - a\), \(e = 9 - b\), \(f = 9 - c\):
   \[
   9a + 9 + 9b + 9 + 9c + 9 = 99 \implies 9(a + b + c) + 27 = 99 \implies a + b + c = 8
   \]

5. **Counting Solutions:**
   The number of non-negative integer solutions to \(a + b + c = 8\) is given

---------------

 by the stars and bars theorem:
   \[
   \binom{8 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{10}{2} = 45
   \]
   Each solution corresponds to a valid grid configuration.

### Conclusion:
The number of ways to fill the grid is **45**.
