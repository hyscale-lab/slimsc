Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set B. Each box in B has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Then

---------------

, I need to express r squared as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I

---------------

 remember that a rectangular box has three dimensions: length (let's say x), width (y), and height (z). The surface area of

---------------

 a rectangular box is given by 2(xy + yz + xz), and the volume is xyz. 

So, for

---------------

 each box in set B, we have:

1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54


---------------

2. xyz = 23

I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere's

---------------

 diameter has to be at least as long as the space diagonal of the box because the sphere must enclose the entire box. The space diagonal d

---------------

 of a box is given by sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius r of the sphere would

---------------

 be half of that, so r = d/2. Thus, r squared would be (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, my

---------------

 goal is to minimize r squared, which is equivalent to minimizing (x² + y² + z²). Alternatively, I can just

---------------

 minimize x² + y² + z² because dividing by 4 won't affect where the minimum occurs.

So, I

---------------

 need to minimize x² + y² + z² subject to the constraints:

1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 →

---------------

 xy + yz + xz = 27
2. xyz = 23

This seems like an optimization problem with constraints. I think I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers,

---------------

 but maybe there's a simpler way using inequalities or substitution.

Let me think about using the method of Lagrange multipliers. We

---------------

 can set up the function to minimize as f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z², and the constraints are g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + xz = 27 and h(x, y, z) = xyz = 23.

Wait

---------------

, but Lagrange multipliers with two constraints might get complicated. Maybe there's a smarter substitution or an inequality I can use.

I

---------------

 remember that for positive real numbers, the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean inequality (AM-GM) might help. But how

---------------

?

Alternatively, maybe I can express two variables in terms of the third using the constraints and then minimize the function.

Let me try

---------------

 that. Let me assume that x, y, z are positive real numbers.

Let me denote S = x + y + z, P = xy + yz + xz = 27, and Q = xyz = 23.

I

---------------

 need to find x² + y² + z². I know that x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + xz) = S² - 2P = S² - 54.

So, to

---------------

 minimize x² + y² + z², I need to minimize S², which is the square of the sum of the sides.

So

---------------

, I need to find the minimum value of S, given that P = 27 and Q = 23.

Hmm

---------------

, how can I relate S, P, and Q?

I know that for three variables, given P and Q, the

---------------

 minimum S is not straightforward. Maybe I can express variables in terms of each other.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider symmetry. Maybe

---------------

 the minimal S occurs when x = y = z, but wait, if x = y = z, then the box is a cube. Let me check if that's possible.

If x = y = z = a, then the

---------------

 surface area is 6a² = 54 → a² = 9 → a = 3. Then the volume would be a³ = 27, but the

---------------

 volume is given as 23, which is less than 27. So, a cube isn't possible here because

---------------

 the volume doesn't match. Therefore, the minimal S may not occur at x = y = z.

Hmm, so the

---------------

 minimal S is when the box is as close to a cube as possible? Or perhaps when two variables are equal?

Wait, in

---------------

 optimization problems with symmetric constraints, sometimes the extremum occurs when two variables are equal. Maybe I can set y = z and see what happens.

Let me assume

---------------

 y = z. Then, let's express the variables in terms of x.

If y = z, then the surface area equation becomes:

2(xy + yz + xz) = 2(xy + y² + xy) = 2(2xy + y²) = 54.

Divide both sides by 2: 2xy + y² = 27.

Similarly

---------------

, the volume is xyz = x y² = 23.

So, now I have two equations:

1. 2xy + y² = 27
2. x y² = 23

Let me solve these equations for x and y.

From equation 2: x = 23 / y².

Substitute into equation 1:

2*(23 / y²)*y + y² = 27


---------------

Simplify:

(46 / y) + y² = 27

Multiply both sides by y to eliminate the denominator:

46 + y³ = 27y

Bring all terms to one side:

y³ - 27y + 46 = 0

Hmm

---------------

, solving this cubic equation. Maybe I can factor it.

Let me try possible rational roots. The possible roots are factors of 46 over 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Let me test y=2:

2³ -27*2 +46 = 8 -54 +46 = 0 → 0. So

---------------

, y=2 is a root.

So, (y - 2) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or factorization.

Divide y³ -27y +46 by (y - 2).

Using synthetic division:

2 | 1  0  -27  46
       

---------------

 2   4  -46
      1  2  -23  0

So, the cubic factors as (y - 2)(y² + 2y -23) = 0.

So

---------------

, other roots are solutions to y² + 2y -23 =0.

Using quadratic formula: y = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6).

Since y must be positive (as

---------------

 a dimension), we have y = -1 + 2*sqrt(6). Let's approximate sqrt(6) ≈ 2.449, so y ≈ -1 + 4.898 ≈ 3.898.

Wait, so when

---------------

 y=2, that's another solution. So, y=2, and the other positive solution is y ≈ 3.898.

So

---------------

, let's consider both possibilities.

First, y=2:

If y=2, then from equation 2: x = 23 / y² = 23 /4 = 5.75.

So, x=5.75, y=2, z=2.

Compute

---------------

 S = x + y + z = 5.75 + 2 + 2 = 9.75.

Then

---------------

, x² + y² + z² = (5.75)^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 33.0625 + 4 + 4 = 41.0625.

So

---------------

, r^2 = 41.0625 /4 ≈ 10.265625. Hmm

---------------

, that's one possibility.

Alternatively, let's consider y = -1 + 2*sqrt(6). Let's compute that

---------------

.

Compute y: sqrt(6) ≈ 2.449, so 2*sqrt(6) ≈ 4.898. So, y ≈ -1 + 4.898 ≈ 3.898.

Then, from equation 2: x = 23 / y².

Compute y²: (3.898)^2 ≈ 15.193

---------------

.

So, x ≈ 23 / 15.193 ≈ 1.513.

So, x ≈ 1.513, y ≈3.898, z=y

---------------

≈3.898.

Compute S = x + y + z ≈ 1.513 + 3.898 + 3.898 ≈ 9.309.

Compute

---------------

 x² + y² + z² ≈ (1.513)^2 + (3.898)^2 + (3.898)^2 ≈ 2.289 + 15.193 +15.193 ≈ 32.675.

So

---------------

, r squared is 32.675 /4 ≈ 8.16875.

Wait

---------------

, that's smaller than the previous case. So, which one is the actual minimum?

Hmm, perhaps the case where y=

---------------

2 gives a larger x² + y² + z², while the other case where y≈3.898 gives a smaller sum. So, the

---------------

 minimal x² + y² + z² occurs when y and z are larger, but x is smaller.

But wait, in

---------------

 the second case, x is approximately 1.513, which is less than y and z. So, perhaps

---------------

 that's the minimal sum.

But I need to confirm whether this is indeed the minimal value.

Alternatively, maybe I can use

---------------

 the method of Lagrange multipliers more formally.

Let me set up the Lagrangian function.

We have to minimize f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z².



---------------

Subject to the constraints:

g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + xz = 27,

h(x, y, z) = xyz = 23.

So

---------------

, the Lagrangian is:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ(xy + yz + xz -27) - μ(xyz -23).

We

---------------

 can take partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, and set them to zero.

Compute ∂L/∂x = 2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0,

Similarly,

∂L/∂y = 2y - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) = 0,

∂L/∂z = 2z - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) = 0.

So

---------------

, we have the system:

1. 2x = λ(y + z) + μ(yz)

2. 2y = λ(x + z) + μ(xz)

3. 2z = λ(x + y) + μ(xy)

And

---------------

 the constraints:

4. xy + yz + xz = 27,

5. xyz =23.

Hmm, this

---------------

 is a system of five equations with five variables: x, y, z, λ, μ.

This looks quite involved. Maybe I

---------------

 can find a relationship between variables.

Let me try subtracting equation 1 and equation 2.

Equation 1 - Equation 2:

2x - 2y = λ(y + z - x - z) + μ(yz - xz)

Simplify:

2(x - y) = λ(y - x) + μ z (y - x)

Factor out (y - x):

2(x - y) = (λ + μ z)(y - x)

Multiply

---------------

 both sides by (-1):

2(y - x) = (λ + μ z)(y - x)

If y ≠ x, we can divide both sides by (y - x):

2 = λ + μ z.

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 - equation 3:

2y - 2z = λ(x + z - x - y) + μ(xz - xy)

Simplify:

2(y - z) = λ(z - y) + μ x (z - y)

Factor out (z - y):

2(y - z) = (λ - μ x)(z - y)

Multiply both sides by (-1):

2(z - y) = (λ - μ x)(z - y)

If z ≠ y, we can divide both sides by (z - y):

2 = λ - μ x.

Similarly, subtracting equation 1 - equation 3:

2x - 2z = λ(y + z - x - y) + μ(yz - xy)

Simplify:

2(x - z) = λ(z - x) + μ y (z - x)

Factor out (z - x):

2(x - z) = (λ + μ y)(z - x)

Multiply both sides by (-1):

2(z - x) = (λ + μ y)(z - x)

If z ≠ x, divide both sides by (z - x):

2 = λ + μ y.

So now, from these three

---------------

 results:

A. 2 = λ + μ z,

B. 2 = λ - μ x,

C. 2 = λ + μ y.

So

---------------

, from A and C:

λ + μ z = λ + μ y → μ z = μ y.

If μ ≠ 0, then z = y.

If

---------------

 μ = 0, then equations A and C would become λ = 2. Let me check that case.

Case 1: μ = 0.

Then, from equations A and C: λ = 2.

Then

---------------

, from equation B: 2 = λ - μ x → 2 = 2 - 0 → 2=2, which is okay

---------------

.

From equation 1: 2x = λ(y + z) + μ yz → 2x = 2(y + z).

So

---------------

, x = y + z.

Similarly, equation 2: 2y = 2(x + z) → y = x + z.

But

---------------

 from equation 1: x = y + z. So substituting into equation 2: y = (y + z) + z → y = y + 2z → 0 = 2z → z=0.

But z=0 is

---------------

 not possible because the volume xyz=23 can't be zero. So, this case is invalid. Therefore, μ ≠ 0.

So

---------------

, from earlier, when μ ≠0, we have z = y.

So, z = y.

Therefore, the box is such

---------------

 that two sides are equal: z = y.

So, this brings us back to the earlier assumption where I set y = z. So, that

---------------

 was a valid approach.

So, now, going back, we have y = z, so the variables are x, y, y.

So

---------------

, the surface area equation is 2(xy + y^2 + xy) = 54 → 2(2xy + y^2) =54 → 4xy + 2y²=54 → 2xy + y²=27.

The

---------------

 volume is x y²=23.

So, from the volume equation, x=23/(y²).

Substitute into surface area equation:

2*(23/(y²))*y + y²=27 → 46/y + y²=27.

Multiply by y: 46 + y³=27y → y³ -27y +46=0.

Earlier

---------------

, I found that y=2 is a root. So, factoring gives (y-2)(y² + 2y -23)=0.

So

---------------

, the other roots are y = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = (-2 ± 4*sqrt(6))/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6).

Since

---------------

 y must be positive, y= -1 + 2*sqrt(6) ≈ 3.898.

So, we

---------------

 have two possible solutions:

1. y=2, leading to x=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75,

---------------

 z=2.

2. y= -1 + 2*sqrt(6), leading to x=23/(y²)

---------------

 ≈1.513, z=y≈3.898.

Now, let's compute x² + y² + z² for both cases.

Case 1:

x=5.75, y=2, z=2.

x²=33.0625, y²=4, z²=4.

Sum: 33.0625 + 4 +4=41.0625.

Case 2:

x≈1.513, y≈3.898, z≈3.898.

x²≈(1.513)^2≈2.289, y²≈(3.898)^2≈15.193, z²≈15.193.

Sum≈2.289 +15.193 +15.193≈32.675.

So, case

---------------

 2 gives a smaller sum, which is better for minimizing r².

Therefore, the minimal x² + y² + z² is approximately 32.675, but let

---------------

's find the exact value.

Since in case 2, y= -1 + 2*sqrt(6).

Compute y²

---------------

:

y = -1 + 2√6.

y² = (-1)^2 + (2√6)^2 + 2*(-1)*(2√6) =1 + 24 -4√6 =25 -4√6.

Wait

---------------

, let me compute that again:

Wait, (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b². But

---------------

 here, a=-1, b=2√6.

So,

y² = (-1 + 2√6)^2 = (-1)^2 + 2*(-1)*(2√6) + (2√6)^2 =1 -4√6 + 24=25 -4√6.

So

---------------

, y²=25 -4√6.

Similarly, x=23/(y²)=23/(25 -4√6).

We

---------------

 can rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

x=23*(25 +4√6)/[(25)^2 - (4√6)^2] =23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 16*6)=23*(25 +4√6)/(625 -96)=23*(25 +4√6)/529.

Simplify denominator

---------------

: 529=23².

So, x= [23*(25 +4√6)] /23² = (25 +4√6)/23.

So, x= (25 +4√6)/23.

Now

---------------

, compute x²:

x² = [(25 +4√6)/23]^2.

Let me compute numerator:

(25 +4√6)^2=25² + 2*25*4√6 + (4√6)^2=625 +200√6 + 16*6=625 +200√6 +96=721 +200√6.

So, x²= (721 +200√6)/23²= (721 +200√6)/529.

Similarly, y²=25 -4√6.

z

---------------

²=y²=25 -4√6.

So, sum x² + y² + z² = [721 +200√6]/529 + 2*(25 -4√6).

Wait

---------------

, let me compute 2*(25 -4√6)=50 -8√6.

Now, express everything

---------------

 over 529:

Sum = [721 +200√6 + 50*529 -8√6*529]/529.

Wait, no

---------------

. Wait, I think I made a mistake here.

Wait, the sum is x² + y² + z² = (721 +200√6)/529 + (25 -4√6) + (25 -4√6).

But

---------------

 to add these, I need to express them with a common denominator.

So, let's write each term:

x² = (721 +200√6)/529,

y²=25 -4√6 = (25*529 -4√6*529)/529,



---------------

Wait, actually, better to compute each term as fractions:

x² = (721 +200√6)/529,

y² =25 -4√6 = (25*1) -4√6,



---------------

z² =25 -4√6.

So, sum = (721 +200√6)/529 + 25 -4√6 +25 -4√6.

Combine

---------------

 like terms:

Sum = (721 +200√6)/529 + 50 -8√6.

Convert

---------------

 50 and -8√6 to have denominator 529:

50 = (50*529)/529 = 26450/529,

-8√6 = (-8√6 *529)/529 =

---------------

 (-4232√6)/529.

So,

Sum = [721 +200√6 +26450 -4232√6]/529.

Combine like terms:

N

---------------

umerator: 721 +26450 =27171,

200√6 -4232√6 = -4032√6.

So,

Sum = (27171 -4032√6)/529.

Thus

---------------

, x² + y² + z² = (27171 -4032√6)/529.

Therefore

---------------

, r squared is this divided by 4.

So,

r² = (27171 -4032√6)/(529*4) = (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

Wait

---------------

, but 27171 and 4032 may have a common factor with 2116.



---------------

Let me check.

2116 is 46². Let me factor numerator and denominator.

First, check if numerator and

---------------

 denominator have a common factor.

Compute GCD of 27171, 4032, and 2116.

First

---------------

, factor 2116:

2116 ÷ 2 = 1058

1058 ÷2=529

529 is 23².

So, 2116=2² *23².

Now, check 27171:

27171 ÷23: 23*1000=23000, 27171-23000=4171.

4171 ÷23: 23*181=4163, 4171-4163=8 → Not

---------------

 divisible by 23.

Check 27171 ÷ 3: 2+7+1+7+1=18, which is divisible by 3. 27171 ÷3=9057.

9057 ÷3=3019.

3019 is a prime? Let me check.



---------------

3019 ÷7≈431.28, 7*431=3017, remainder 2.



---------------

3019 ÷11≈274.45, 11*274=3014, remainder 5.

3

---------------

019 ÷13≈232.23, 13*232=3016, remainder 3.

3

---------------

019 ÷17≈177.58, 17*177=3009, remainder 10.

3

---------------

019 ÷19≈158.89, 19*158=3002, remainder 17.

3

---------------

019 ÷23≈131.26, 23*131=3013, remainder 6.

So

---------------

, 3019 is prime. So, 27171=3² *3019.

Similarly

---------------

, 4032: 4032 ÷2=2016, ÷2=1008, ÷2=504, ÷2=252, ÷2=126, ÷2=63,

---------------

 ÷3=21, ÷3=7.

So, 4032=2^6 *3^2 *7.

So

---------------

, the numerator is (27171 -4032√6) = 3²*3019 - 2^6*3²*7 *√6.

Looking

---------------

 for common factors with denominator 2²*23².

I don't see any common factors between numerator and denominator,

---------------

 except possibly 1.

Wait, 27171 and 2116: 27171 is

---------------

 3²*3019, 2116 is 2²*23². No common factors.



---------------

Similarly, 4032 and 2116: 4032 is 2^6*3²*7, 2116 is 2²*23². Common

---------------

 factor is 4.

So, can we factor 4 from numerator and denominator?

Yes, because 4032 is divisible by 4, and 2116 is 4*529.

So, let's factor 4 from numerator and denominator.

N

---------------

umerator: 27171 -4032√6 =27171 -4*(1008√6).

Denominator:2116=4*529.

So,

r² = (27171 -4*1008√6)/(4*529) = [27171/4 - 1008√6]/529.

But 27171 ÷4 is not an integer. 

---------------

27171 = 4*6792.75.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier

---------------

.

Wait, perhaps I can write numerator as (27171 -4032√6) and denominator 2116.

But

---------------

 27171 and 4032√6 don't share a common factor with denominator except 1.

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of x² + y² + z².

Let me go back.

Wait

---------------

, x² + y² + z² = x² + 2y².

We have x= (25 +4√6)/23,

x

---------------

²= (25 +4√6)^2 /23²= (625 + 200√6 + 96)/529= (721 +200√6)/529.

y

---------------

²=25 -4√6.

So, x² + 2y²= (721 +200√6)/529 + 2*(25 -4√6).

Compute

---------------

 2*(25 -4√6)=50 -8√6.

So, x² + 2y²= (721 +200√6)/529 +50 -8√6.

Convert

---------------

 50 to over 529: 50= (50*529)/529=26450/529.

Similarly, -8√6= (-8√6 *529)/529= (-4232√6)/529.

So, adding

---------------

 all together:

x² + 2y²= [721 +200√6 +26450 -4232√6]/529.

Compute

---------------

 numerator:

721 +26450=27171,

200√6 -4232√6= -4032√6.

So, numerator is 27171 -4032√6.

Thus

---------------

, x² + y² + z²= (27171 -4032√6)/529.

Therefore

---------------

, r²= (27171 -4032√6)/(4*529)= (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

So

---------------

, now, is this fraction reducible? Let's check if numerator and denominator have a common factor.

We have numerator

---------------

: 27171 -4032√6,

Denominator:2116=4*529=4*23².

Looking

---------------

 at the rational part and the irrational part separately.

The rational part of numerator is 27171, which is 3²*3019.



---------------

The denominator is 4*23². 23 is a prime number.

Since 3019 is a prime and

---------------

 3019 is not a multiple of 23 (as 23*131=3013, 

---------------

3019-3013=6), so no common factors.

Similarly, the coefficient of √6 is -4032, which is 2^6*3^2*7.

Den

---------------

ominator is 4*23², which is 2²*23².

So, the common factor between numerator

---------------

's coefficient of √6 and denominator is 4.

Therefore, I can factor 4 from the numerator and denominator.

So

---------------

,

r² = [ (27171 -4032√6) ] / 2116

= [ (27171/

---------------

4) - (4032/4)√6 ] / (2116/4 )

= [ (27171/4) - 1008√6 ] / 529.

But 27171 �

---------------

�4 is 6792.75, which is not an integer. Hmm, maybe this isn't helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I

---------------

 can write numerator as (27171 -4032√6) and see if it can be expressed

---------------

 as a multiple of something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating x² + y² + z². Let me double

---------------

-check.

We have x= (25 +4√6)/23,

y= z= -1 +2√6.

So

---------------

,

x² + y² + z² = x² + 2y².

Compute x²:

(25 +4√6)^2=625 + 200√6 + 96=721 +200√6.

So

---------------

, x²= (721 +200√6)/529.

Compute y²:

y= -1 +2√6,

y²=1 -4√6 +24=25 -4√6.

So, 2y²=50 -8√6.

Now

---------------

, x² + 2y²= (721 +200√6)/529 +50 -8√6.

To

---------------

 add these, express 50 and -8√6 with denominator 529.

So,

50=50*529/529=26450/529,

-8√6= (-8√6)*529/529= (-4232√6)/529.

Thus

---------------

,

x² + 2y²= [721 +200√6 +26450 -4232√6]/529.

Which

---------------

 is (27171 -4032√6)/529.

Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, r²= (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

But

---------------

 this is a messy expression, and I need to write it as p/q where p and q are coprime integers.

Wait, but in

---------------

 the numerator, we have a term with √6, which is irrational. So, how can r² be a rational number?

Wait, that

---------------

 can't be. Because r² must be a real number, but here, it's expressed as a fraction involving √6, which is irrational.

But

---------------

 the problem states that r² can be written as p/q, which are integers, meaning r² is rational. So, perhaps

---------------

 I made a mistake in my earlier approach.

Wait, let's think again. When we set y = z, we found

---------------

 two possible solutions, but the case where y=2 gives x=5.75, which is a rational number, but

---------------

 the other case gives irrational numbers.

But perhaps the minimal r² is achieved at y=2, but that contradicts the

---------------

 earlier calculation where the sum was smaller in the other case.

Wait, but if r² is rational, then the case where y

---------------

=2 must be the correct one because the other case gives an irrational r².

Wait, but that can't be,

---------------

 because the minimal sphere must have a rational radius squared?

Wait, the problem says r² can be written as p/q, so

---------------

 it must be rational. Therefore, perhaps the minimal occurs at y=2, but that seems contradictory because in that case, the

---------------

 sum was larger.

Hmm, perhaps I made a wrong assumption earlier.

Wait, let's go back. Maybe the minimal x

---------------

² + y² + z² is achieved when the box is a cube, but that's not possible because the volume doesn

---------------

't match.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider other cases where variables are not equal.

Wait, perhaps the minimal occurs when all

---------------

 three variables are equal, but as we saw, that's not possible because the volume is 23, not 27.

Wait

---------------

, another thought: perhaps the minimal sphere is determined by the space diagonal, which is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So

---------------

, to minimize r, we need to minimize sqrt(x² + y² + z²), which is equivalent to minimizing x² + y² + z².

But

---------------

 from the earlier analysis, when y = z, we get two possibilities: one with x=5.75, y=z=2, which

---------------

 gives x² + y² + z²=41.0625, and another with x≈1.513, y=z≈3.898, which gives x² + y² + z²≈32.675.

But the

---------------

 problem is, in the second case, r² is irrational, but the problem states that r² is a rational number p/q.

So

---------------

, perhaps the minimal occurs at y=2, which gives a rational r².

Wait, but why would that be? Because

---------------

 if the minimal occurs at the other point, which gives an irrational r², but the problem states that r² is rational.

Hmm

---------------

, maybe my earlier approach is flawed.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the minimal sphere that can contain all boxes in set B has

---------------

 a radius determined by the maximum of the space diagonals of all boxes in B. But the problem says "the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes",

---------------

 which suggests that the sphere must enclose all such boxes, so the sphere must have a radius at least as large as the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B.

Wait, no

---------------

, wait. The sphere must contain each individual box, so for each box, the sphere must contain it. So, the sphere must have a radius at

---------------

 least as large as the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B. But the problem says "the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes", meaning that it

---------------

's the minimal sphere that works for all boxes in B. Therefore, the radius must be the supremum of the space diagonals of all boxes in B. So

---------------

, perhaps the sphere's radius is determined by the maximum possible space diagonal among all boxes in B.

But wait, that's

---------------

 different from what I thought earlier. So, perhaps I need to find the maximum of x² + y² + z² given

---------------

 the constraints, but that would make r² as large as possible. But the problem says "the smallest sphere that can contain each of the boxes", which implies

---------------

 that the sphere must contain all boxes, so the sphere's radius must be at least as large as the maximum space diagonal of any box in B. Therefore

---------------

, r is the maximum of (sqrt(x² + y² + z²)) over all boxes in B.

But then

---------------

, to find r, I need to find the maximum of x² + y² + z² given the constraints.

Wait, but

---------------

 earlier, I thought I needed to minimize x² + y² + z², but now, perhaps it's the opposite: find

---------------

 the maximum of x² + y² + z².

Wait, let me re-read the problem statement.

"The last line of your response should be your integer answer within \boxed{}.

Let B be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. Let r be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B. The value of r² can be written as p/q, where p and q are relatively prime positive integers. Find p+q."

So

---------------

, the sphere must contain each box in B. So, the sphere must enclose every possible box with surface area 54 and volume 23. Therefore, the sphere's radius must be large enough to contain the "

---------------

largest" such box, where "largest" is in terms of the space diagonal.

Therefore, r is the maximum of the space diagonals of all boxes in B.

So

---------------

, I need to find the maximum of sqrt(x² + y² + z²) over all x, y, z>

---------------

0 satisfying 2(xy + yz +xz)=54 and xyz=23.

Thus, I need to maximize x² + y² + z².



---------------

Hmm, that's different from my initial approach where I tried to minimize it. So, I need to find the maximum of x² + y² + z² given the constraints.

So

---------------

, let's redefine the problem: maximize x² + y² + z² subject to 2(xy + yz + xz)=54 and xyz=23.

So

---------------

, how do I approach this? Again, perhaps using Lagrange multipliers.

Let me set up the Lagrangian.



---------------

We need to maximize f(x,y,z)=x² + y² + z²,

Subject to g(x,y,z)=xy + yz + xz=27,

and h(x,y,z)=xyz=23.

So

---------------

, the Lagrangian is:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ(xy + yz + xz -27) - μ(xyz -23).

Compute

---------------

 partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x=2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz)=0,

∂L/∂y=2y - λ(x + z) - μ(xz)=0,

∂L/∂z=2z - λ(x + y) - μ(xy)=0,

and

---------------

 the constraints:

xy + yz + xz=27,

xyz=23.

So, the same system as before, but now we are looking for the

---------------

 maximum.

So, the same system applies. So, from the partial derivatives, we get:

1. 2x = λ(y + z) + μ(yz),

2. 2y = λ(x + z) + μ(xz),

3. 2z = λ(x + y) + μ(xy).

Earlier

---------------

, when I subtracted equations, I found that if y≠x, then 2=λ + μ z,

Similarly

---------------

, if z≠y, then 2=λ - μ x,

and 2=λ + μ y.

From

---------------

 these, we concluded that either variables are equal or μ=0, but μ=0 led to a contradiction.

So, in

---------------

 the case where variables are not equal, we have:

λ + μ z=2,

λ - μ x=2,

λ + μ y=2.

Subtracting the first and third equations:

(λ + μ z) - (λ + μ y) = 2 - 2 → μ(z - y)=0.

Since

---------------

 μ≠0 (as we saw earlier), this implies z=y.

Similarly, subtracting the second and first equations:

(λ - μ x) - (λ + μ z)=2 -2 → -μ x -μ z=0 → μ(-x -z)=0.

Since μ≠0, this implies -x -z=0 → x= -z.

But x and z are lengths, so positive. Thus

---------------

, x= -z is impossible. Therefore, this case is invalid.

Therefore, the only possibility is that two variables are equal, say

---------------

 y=z.

So, again, we have y=z.

Thus, the problem reduces to the same case as before.

So

---------------

, we have y=z.

So, the constraints become:

xy + y² + xy=27 → 2xy + y²=27,

xyz= x y²=23.

So, same

---------------

 as before.

So, solving for x and y:

From volume: x=23/(y²).

Substitute into surface area equation:

2*(23/(y²))*y + y²=27 → 46/y + y²=27.

Multiply by y:46 + y³=27y → y³ -27y +46=0.

Which

---------------

 factors as (y-2)(y² +2y -23)=0.

So, solutions y=2, y= -1 + 2√6≈3.898, y= -1 -2√6≈-4.898 (discarded as negative).

So, the

---------------

 possible y values are 2 and ≈3.898.

So, for y=2, x=23/4=5.75, z=2.

For

---------------

 y≈3.898, x≈1.513, z≈3.898.

Now

---------------

, compute x² + y² + z² for both cases.

Case 1: x=5.75, y=2, z=2.

x²=33.0625, y²=4, z²=4.

Sum=33.0625+4+4=41.0625.

Case 2: x≈1.513, y≈3.898, z≈3.898.

x²≈2.289, y²≈15.193, z²≈15.193.

Sum≈2.289 +15.193 +15.193≈32.675.

So, the

---------------

 maximum of x² + y² + z² is 41.0625, which is larger than the other case.

Therefore

---------------

, the maximum space diagonal occurs when y=2, x=5.75, z=2.

Thus, the maximum

---------------

 x² + y² + z² is 41.0625.

Therefore, r is half of sqrt(41.0625).

Compute sqrt(41.0625):

---------------

 sqrt(41.0625)=6.40625, because 6.40625²=41.0625.

Wait

---------------

, 6.40625 *6.40625:

6*6=36,

6*0.40625=2.4375,

0.40625*6=2.4375,

0.40625*0.40625≈0.165.

So

---------------

, 36 +2.4375 +2.4375 +0.165≈41.039,

---------------

 which is close to 41.0625.

Wait, perhaps a better way: 41.0625 = 41 + 0.0625.



---------------

0.0625=1/16, so sqrt(41 + 1/16).

But

---------------

 6.4²=40.96, 6.41²= approx 6.4² + 2*6.4*0.01 +0.01²=40.96 +0.128 +0.0001=41.0881.

Wait

---------------

, 6.41²=41.0881, which is larger than 41.0625.

So

---------------

, let's compute 6.40625²:

6.40625 *6.40625.

Compute

---------------

 6 *6=36,

6 *0.40625=2.4375,

0.40625 *6=2.4375,

0.40625 *0.40625=0.1650390625.

So

---------------

, 36 +2.4375 +2.4375 +0.1650390625= 36 +4.875 +0.1650390625=40.0

---------------

400390625? Wait, that can't be.

Wait, no, perhaps a better way:

---------------

 6.40625 is 6 + 0.40625.

(6 + 0.40625)^2 = 6² + 2*6*0.40625 + (0.40625)^2 =36 + 4.875 +0.1650390625=40.0400390625.



---------------

Wait, that's 40.04, but our value is 41.0625. Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 I'm miscalculating.

Wait, 6.40625 is equal to 6 + 65/160?

---------------

 Wait, 0.40625=13/32.

Wait, 13/32=0.40625.

So, 6.40625=6 +13/32= (6*32 +13)/32= (192 +13)/32=205/32.

Compute (205/32)^2= (205)^2/(32)^2=42025/1024.

Compute

---------------

 42025 ÷1024≈41.0625.

Yes, because 42025=

---------------

1024*41 + 0.0625*1024.

So, 42025=1024*41=41984, plus

---------------

 41. So, 41984 +41=42025.

So, (205/32)^2=42025/1024=41.0625.

Therefore

---------------

, sqrt(41.0625)=205/32=6.40625.

So, the space diagonal is 205/32, so the radius r is half of that: (205/32)/2=205/64.

Thus, r squared is (205/64)^2= (205)^2/(64)^2=42025/4096.

S

---------------

implify 42025 and 4096.

4096 is 2^12.

42025: let's check if it's divisible by 5: 

---------------

42025 ends with 5, so yes.

42025 ÷5=8405.

8405 ÷5=1681.

1681 is 41².

So, 42025=5² *41².

4096=2^12.

So, 42025/4096= (5*41)^2/(2^6)^2= (205)^2/(64)^2.

But

---------------

 205 and 64 are coprime because 205 factors into 5*41, and 64 is 2^6.

---------------

 No common factors.

So, 42025 and 4096 are coprime?

Wait, 42025=5² *41²,

4096=2^12.

No common prime factors. So, yes

---------------

, 42025/4096 is in lowest terms.

Therefore, r²=42025/4096.

Thus, p=42025, q=4096.

p

---------------

+q=42025 +4096=46121.

Wait, but let me confirm

---------------

 if 42025 and 4096 are coprime.

Yes, as 42025 is 5² *41², and 4096 is 2^12. They share no common prime factors. So, the

---------------

 fraction is reduced.

Therefore, p+q=42025 +4096=46121.

Wait

---------------

, but 42025 +4096=46121.

Yes, 42025 +4096=46121.

So

---------------

, the answer is 46121.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the minimal x² + y² + z² was 

---------------

32.675, but that would give a smaller sphere. But the problem says the sphere must contain each box in B, which would

---------------

 require the sphere to have a radius large enough to contain the box with the maximum space diagonal.

Therefore, the correct approach was to find the maximum x² + y² + z², which occurs when y=2, giving r²=42025/4096, leading

---------------

 to p+q=46121.


To solve the problem, we need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set $\

---------------

mathcal{B}$, where each box has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The radius squared, $r^2$, must

---------------

 be expressed as a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$, and we need to find $p + q$.

### Key Steps:

1. **Constraints on

---------------

 the Box**:
   - Surface area: $2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 \implies xy + yz + xz = 27$.
   - Volume: $xyz = 23$.

2. **Space Diagonal**:
   - The space diagonal of a box with dimensions $x, y, z$ is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$.
   - The radius $r$ of the smallest sphere containing the box is half the space diagonal: $r = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}{2}$.
   - Thus, $r^2 = \frac{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}{4}$.

3. **Maximizing the Space Diagonal**:
   - To ensure the sphere contains all boxes in $\mathcal{B}$, we need the maximum space diagonal among

---------------

 all such boxes.
   - This requires maximizing $x^2 + y^2 + z^2$ under the given constraints.

4. **Using

---------------

 Symmetry**:
   - Assume $y = z$ to simplify the problem. This reduces the constraints to:
     - $2xy + y^2 = 27$.
     - $x y^2 = 23$.
   - Solving these, we find two possible solutions: $y = 2$ with $x = 5.75$, and $y \approx 3.898$ with $x \approx 1.513$.

5. **Calculating $x^2 + y^2 + z^2$**:
   - For $y = 2$ and $x = 5.75$, $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 41.0625$.
   - For $y \approx 3.898$, $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \approx 32.675$.
   - The maximum occurs at $y = 2$, giving $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 41.0625$.

6. **Finding

---------------

 $r^2$**:
   - $r^2 = \frac{41.0625}{4} = \frac{42025}{4096}$.
   - Here

---------------

, $p = 42025$ and $q = 4096$, which are coprime.

7. **Final Result**:
   - $p + q = 42025 + 4096 = 46121$.
