Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Aya's morning walk. Let me try to understand what's going on. 



---------------

So, every morning, Aya walks 9 kilometers. She stops at a coffee shop after her walk. The problem is

---------------

 about figuring out how long her walk takes when she walks at a slightly increased speed, including the time she spends at the coffee shop.

Let

---------------

 me parse the details. 

First scenario: She walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour. The walk takes her 4 hours, which

---------------

 includes 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop. 

Second scenario: She walks at 's + 2' kilometers per hour. This

---------------

 time, the walk takes 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including 't' minutes at the coffee shop. 

We

---------------

 need to find the time her walk takes when she walks at 's + 1/2' kilometers per hour, including 't' minutes at

---------------

 the coffee shop.

Hmm, okay. So, the key here is to find the values of 's' and 't' first

---------------

, right? Because once we have those, we can compute the time for the third scenario.

Wait, but let's think

---------------

 about how to model this. Since she walks 9 kilometers each time, the time she spends walking (excluding coffee shop time) should

---------------

 be total time minus 't' minutes. 

Wait, but time is given in hours for the first scenario and in hours and minutes for the second. I

---------------

 should convert all times to the same unit, probably minutes, to make it easier.

Let's see. 

In the first scenario, the total time is 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. Out

---------------

 of these, 't' minutes are spent in the coffee shop, so the actual walking time is (240 - t) minutes.

Similarly, the second scenario has

---------------

 a total time of 2 hours and 24 minutes. Converting that to minutes: 2 * 60 + 24 = 120 + 24 = 144 minutes. So, walking time is (144 - t) minutes.

But

---------------

 wait, walking time can also be calculated based on distance and speed. The formula is time = distance / speed. But the

---------------

 speed is given in km/h, and time is in minutes, so I need to convert units.

Let me outline the equations

---------------

. 

First scenario:
Walking speed = s km/h
Distance = 9 km
Total time including coffee = 4 hours = 240 minutes
Walking time = 240 - t minutes



---------------

So, walking time in hours would be (240 - t)/60 hours.

Therefore, 9 = s * [(240 - t)/60]

Similarly

---------------

, second scenario:
Walking speed = s + 2 km/h
Total time including coffee = 2h24m = 144 minutes
Walking time = 144 - t minutes



---------------

So, walking time in hours is (144 - t)/60

Thus, 9 = (s + 2) * [(144 - t)/60]

So now, I have two equations:

1) 9 = s * [(240 - t)/60]
2) 9 = (s + 2) * [(144 - t)/60]

I

---------------

 can write these equations as:

Equation 1: 9 = s * (240 - t)/60


---------------

Equation 2: 9 = (s + 2) * (144 - t)/60

Let

---------------

 me simplify these equations.

Starting with Equation 1:
Multiply both sides by 60:
9 * 60 = s * (240 - t)
540 = s*(240 - t) -->

---------------

 Equation 1a

Equation 2:
Multiply both sides by 60:
9 * 60 = (s + 2)*(144 - t)
540 = (s + 2)*(144 - t) --> Equation 2a

So now, I have two equations:

540 = s*(240 - t) ...

---------------

 (1a)
540 = (s + 2)*(144 - t) ... (2a)

So

---------------

, now I can set these two expressions equal to each other since both equal 540.

s*(240 - t) = (s + 2)*(144 - t)

Let me expand both sides:

Left side: s*240 - s*t
Right side: (s + 2)*144 - (s + 2)*t = s*144 + 2*144 - s*t - 2*t

So,

---------------

 equation becomes:

s*240 - s*t = s*144 + 288 - s*t - 2*t

Hmm

---------------

, let's subtract s*144 and add s*t to both sides to simplify.

Left side: s*240 - s*t - s*144 + s*t = s*(240 - 144) = s*96
Right side: 288 - 2*t

So,

---------------

 s*96 = 288 - 2*t

Let me write that as:

96s = 288 - 2t -->

---------------

 Equation 3

So, Equation 3 is 96s + 2t = 288

I

---------------

 can divide both sides by 2 to simplify:

48s + t = 144 --> Equation 3a

Now

---------------

, I need another equation to solve for s and t. Let's go back to Equation 1a: 540 = s*(240 - t)

We

---------------

 can express 240 - t from here:

240 - t = 540 / s

But

---------------

 maybe it's better to express t from Equation 3a.

From Equation 3a: t = 144 - 48s

So

---------------

, substituting t into Equation 1a:

540 = s*(240 - (144 - 48s))

Simplify inside the parentheses:

240 - 144 + 48s = 96 + 48s

So, 540 = s*(96 + 48s)

Which

---------------

 is:

540 = 96s + 48s^2

Let me rewrite this:

48s^2 + 96s - 540 = 0

I

---------------

 can divide all terms by 12 to simplify:

4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0

So, now

---------------

 I have a quadratic equation: 4s² +8s -45 =0

Let me solve for s using quadratic formula.

The

---------------

 quadratic is in the form ax² + bx + c =0, so a=4, b=8, c= -45.

Discriminant D = b² -4ac = 8² -4*4*(-45) = 64 + 720 = 784

Square root of 784 is 28.

So, solutions are:

s = [-b ± sqrt(D)]/(2a) = [-8 ±28]/(8)

So

---------------

, two possible solutions:

s = (-8 +28)/8 = 20/8 = 2.5

s = (-8 -28)/8 = (-36)/8 = -4.5

But speed can't be negative, so s=2.5 km/h.

So

---------------

, s=2.5 km/h.

Now, from Equation 3a: t =144 -48s

Sub

---------------

stituting s=2.5:

t =144 -48*(2.5) =144 -120 =24.

So, t=24 minutes.

So

---------------

, now we have s=2.5 and t=24.

Now, the question is asking: when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, which

---------------

 is 2.5 + 0.5 =3 km/h, how long does the walk take, including t minutes.



---------------

So, her walking speed is 3 km/h, distance is 9 km.

Time taken walking is 9 /3 =3 hours.

But

---------------

 wait, we have to include the coffee shop time 't' which is 24 minutes.

So, total time is 3 hours plus 24 minutes.

Convert

---------------

 3 hours to minutes: 3*60=180 minutes.

Adding 24: 180 +24=204 minutes.

So

---------------

, the total time is 204 minutes.

Let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First

---------------

, I set up the two equations based on the two scenarios, then I solved for s and t, found s=2.5 and t=24.

Then, for

---------------

 the third scenario, speed is 3 km/h, distance is 9 km, so time is 3 hours, plus 24 minutes,

---------------

 which totals 204 minutes.

Wait, another thought: in the first scenario, the total time was 4 hours including

---------------

 t=24 minutes. So, walking time would be 4 hours minus 24 minutes: 240 -24=216 minutes walking

---------------

.

At speed s=2.5 km/h, walking time is 216 minutes, which is 3.6 hours.

Distance

---------------

 is 9 km, so 9 = 2.5 * 3.6

2.5 *3.6:

---------------

 2.5 *3=7.5, 2.5*0.6=1.5, total 9. Correct

---------------

.

Second scenario: speed s+2=4.5 km/h.

Walking time is 2h24m =

---------------

144 minutes, which is 2.4 hours.

Distance is 9 km.

9 =4.5 *2.4?



---------------

4.5 *2=9, 4.5*0.4=1.8, so 9 +1.8=10.8?

---------------

 Wait, that's not right.

Wait, wait, wait, I think I messed up.

Wait, 4.5 *2.4:

---------------

 4 *2.4=9.6, 0.5*2.4=1.2, total 10.8?

---------------

 But the distance is 9 km.

Wait, that can't be right. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the

---------------

 calculation.

Wait, wait, no. Because the walking time in the second scenario is 144 minutes, which is 2.4 hours. So

---------------

, 4.5 km/h *2.4 hours = 10.8 km. But she only walks 9 km.

Wait

---------------

, that's a problem. That suggests a miscalculation.

Wait, so where did I go wrong?

Wait, let

---------------

's check the equations again.

Wait, from the second scenario:

Equation 2a: 540 = (s+2)*(144 - t)

We

---------------

 found s=2.5, t=24.

So, (s+2)=4.5, (144 - t)=120.

So, 4.5 *120 = 540.

---------------

 Yes, that's correct.

So, walking time is 120 minutes, which is 2 hours.

Wait, but

---------------

 earlier I thought the total time was 2h24m, which includes t=24 minutes.

So, walking

---------------

 time is 2h24m -24m=2 hours. So, 2 hours walking at 4.5 km/h:

---------------

 4.5*2=9 km. Correct.

So, no problem there. I think I made a mistake earlier when I

---------------

 thought 2.4 hours was the walking time. No, 144 minutes is 2.4 hours,

---------------

 but 144 - t=120 minutes, which is 2 hours.

So, 4.5 km/h *2 hours=9 km. Correct.

So

---------------

, my previous calculation was wrong because I thought 2h24m was walking time, but actually it's total time,

---------------

 so walking time is 2h, coffee time 24m.

So, that's correct.

So, going back,

---------------

 for the third scenario, speed is 3 km/h, distance 9 km.

Walking time is 9 /3 =3 hours.

---------------

 Including coffee time of 24 minutes, total time is 3h24m, which is 204 minutes.

So

---------------

, that's correct.

So, the answer is 204 minutes.


To solve the problem, we first determine Aya's walking speed \( s \) and the time \( t \) she spends at the coffee shop. 

1

---------------

. **First Scenario:**
   - Walking speed: \( s \) km/h
   - Total time: 4 hours (240 minutes)
   - Walking time: \( 240 - t \) minutes
   - Equation: \( 9 = s \times \frac{240 - t}{60} \)
   - Simplified: \( 540 = s(240 - t) \) ...

---------------

 (1)

2. **Second Scenario:**
   - Walking speed: \( s + 2 \) km/h
   - Total time: 2 hours 24 minutes (144 minutes)
   - Walking time: \( 144 - t \) minutes
   - Equation: \( 9 = (s + 2) \times \frac{144 - t}{60} \)
   - Simplified: \( 540 = (s + 2)(144 - t) \) ... (2)

3. **Equating the two expressions for 540:**
   \[
   s(240 - t) = (s + 2)(144 - t)
   \]
   Expanding and simplifying:
   \[
   96s = 288 - 2t \quad \Rightarrow \quad 48s + t = 144 \quad \text{(3)}
   \]

4. **Substitute \( t = 144 - 48s \) into Equation (1):**
   \[
   540 = s(240 - (144 - 48s)) \quad \Rightarrow \quad 540 = s(96 + 48s)
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   48s^2 + 96s - 540 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0
   \]
   Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{784}}{8} \quad \Rightarrow \quad s = 2.5 \, \text{km/h}
   \]
   Substituting \( s = 2.5 \) into Equation (3):
   \[
   t = 144 - 48(2.5) = 24 \, \text{minutes}
   \]

5. **Third Scenario:**
   - Walking speed: \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h
   - Walking time: \( \frac{9}{3} = 3 \) hours (180 minutes)
   - Total time including coffee: \( 180 + 24 = 204 \) minutes

Thus, the total time for the walk, including coffee, is \(\boxed{204}\) minutes.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
