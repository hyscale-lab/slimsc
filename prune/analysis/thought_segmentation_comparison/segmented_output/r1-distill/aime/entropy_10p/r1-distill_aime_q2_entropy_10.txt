Okay, so I have this probability problem about a lottery that Jen is entering. Let me try to understand it step by step.

First, Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the randomly chosen ones

---------------

. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen. The question is asking for the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. They

---------------

 mention this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. Since winning the grand prize means

---------------

 all four numbers are chosen, it's a subset of winning a prize (since at least two are chosen). So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize.

So, the

---------------

 probability we need is P(A) / P(B), where P(A) is the probability that all four of her numbers are chosen, and P(B) is the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen.

Let me formal

---------------

ize this.

First, the total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from S is C(10,4). That

---------------

's the denominator for all probabilities.

P(A): The number of favorable outcomes is 1, because Jen has to pick exactly the 4 numbers that are chosen. So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).

P(B): The probability of at least two numbers matching. That

---------------

 includes cases where exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four numbers match. So, I need to compute the number of ways to

---------------

 have exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 matches.

Let me calculate each component.

Number of ways to have exactly k matches (

---------------

where k=2,3,4):

For exactly k matches, we choose k numbers from Jen's 4, and the remaining (4 - k) numbers from the other 6 numbers in S (since S has 10 numbers, and Jen picked 4, the rest are 6). 



---------------

So, the number of favorable combinations for exactly k matches is C(4,k) * C(6,4 - k).

Therefore

---------------

:

- Exactly 2 matches: C(4,2) * C(6,2)
- Exactly 3 matches: C(4,3) * C(6,1)
- Exactly 4 matches: C(4,4) * C(6,0)

Let

---------------

 me compute these:

C(4,2) = 6, C(6,2)=15. So exactly 2 matches: 6*15=90
C(4,3)=4, C(6,1)=6. Exactly 3 matches:4*6=24
C(4,4)=1, C(6,0)=1. Exactly 4 matches:1*1=1

So total number of favorable outcomes for B is 90 +24 +1=115.

Wait

---------------

, but the total possible combinations are C(10,4)=210. So, P(B)=115/210.

Wait

---------------

, let me double-check that. Because 90 +24 is 114, plus 1 is 115. Yes

---------------

.

But wait, when I think about it, the number of ways to have at least two matches is equal to the sum of exactly 2, exactly 3, and exactly 4 matches, which we've

---------------

 calculated as 90+24+1=115.

So, P(B)=115/210.

And

---------------

 P(A)=1/210.

Therefore, the conditional probability P(A|B) is (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

Wait, that

---------------

 seems low, but let me check the calculations again.

Wait, C(10,4) is 210, correct.

Exactly

---------------

 2 matches: C(4,2)*C(6,2)=6*15=90
Exactly 3 matches: C(4,3)*C(6,1)=4*6=24
Exactly 4 matches: 1


---------------

Total: 90+24+1=115.

So, yes, P(B)=115/210.



---------------

P(A)=1/210.

Therefore, P(A|B)= (1/210)/(115/210)=1/115.

So

---------------

, the probability is 1/115, which simplifies to 1/115 since 1 and 115 are coprime.

Therefore

---------------

, m=1, n=115, so m +n=116.

Wait, but let me think again.

---------------

 Is there a mistake here? Because sometimes in conditional probability, especially with combinatorics, it's easy to make an error.

Wait

---------------

, another way to calculate P(B) is to subtract the probabilities of 0,1 matches from 1.

Wait, let

---------------

 me compute it that way as a check.

Total combinations:210.

Number of ways with 0 matches: C

---------------

(4,0)*C(6,4)=1*15=15.

Number of ways with 1 match: C(4,1)*C(6,3)=4*20=80.

So, total

---------------

 ways with 0 or 1 matches:15+80=95.

Therefore, number of ways with at least 2 matches:210 -95=115.

So

---------------

, same as before. So, P(B)=115/210.

So, that's correct.

H

---------------

ence, P(A|B)=1/115, so m +n=1 +115=116.

Wait

---------------

, but wait a second. Let me think about the problem again.

Wait, the problem says that the probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is m/n. So, is

---------------

 that correct?

Yes, because winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize. So, the conditional probability is correct

---------------

.

Alternatively, another way to think about it: the number of ways she can win a prize is 115, as calculated

---------------

. Of these, only one way is the grand prize. So, the conditional probability is 1/115. So

---------------

 that's consistent.

So, yeah, I think 116 is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( m + n \) is \boxed{116}.


Jen enters a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 9, 10\} \). Four numbers are randomly chosen from \( S \). She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the chosen ones, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen. We need to find the probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize.

First, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from \( S \), which is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \).

Next, we calculate the number of favorable outcomes for each case:
- Exactly 2 matches: \( \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{6}{2} = 6 \times 15 = 90 \)
- Exactly 3 matches: \( \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{6}{1} = 4 \times 6 = 24 \)
- Exactly 4 matches: \( \binom{4}{4} \times \binom{6}{0} = 1 \times 1 = 1 \)

The total number of favorable outcomes for winning a prize is \( 90 + 24 + 1 = 115 \).

The probability of winning a prize \( P(B) \) is \( \frac{115}{210} \).

The probability of winning the grand prize \( P(A) \) is \( \frac{1}{210} \).

The conditional probability \( P(A|B) \) is given by:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{115}{210}} = \frac{1}{115}
\]

Thus, the probability is \( \frac{1}{115} \), where \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

The final answer is \(\boxed{116}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
