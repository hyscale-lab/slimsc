Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and

---------------

 try to understand what's being asked.

Jen enters a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,9,10}. So, S

---------------

 has 10 elements, and she picks 4 unique numbers. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. 

She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. And

---------------

 she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are the ones chosen. 

The question is about the probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize. They

---------------

 say this probability is m/n, where m and n are coprime positive integers, and I need to find m + n.

Alright

---------------

, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, A is the event that she wins the grand prize, and B is the event that she wins a prize. 



---------------

But wait, if she wins the grand prize, that automatically means she also won a prize because having all four numbers match is

---------------

 a subset of having at least two numbers match. So, A is a subset of B, which means P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). Therefore, the conditional probability P(A|B) is P(A)/P(B).

So, I need to find P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize, and P(B), the probability of winning any prize (

---------------

at least two numbers matching). Then, I'll divide them to get the required probability.

First, let's compute P(A). The

---------------

 grand prize is when all four of her numbers are chosen. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4), which is 210. The

---------------

 number of favorable outcomes for the grand prize is just 1 because she has to pick exactly the four numbers that are chosen. So, P(A) is 1 / 210.

Wait, hold

---------------

 on. Is that correct? Let me think. Jen is picking 4 numbers, and the lottery also picks 4 numbers. The probability that Jen

---------------

's four numbers are exactly the same as the lottery's four numbers is indeed 1 / C(10,4) because there's only one way

---------------

 to choose those specific four numbers. So, yes, P(A) is 1/210.

Now, I

---------------

 need to compute P(B), the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen. To find this, it might be easier to compute the complement: the probability that fewer than two numbers are chosen, i.e., zero or one number is chosen. Then, subtract that from 1.

So, P(B) = 1 - P(less than two numbers match

---------------

) = 1 - [P(zero numbers match) + P(exactly one number matches)].

Let me compute each of these.



---------------

First, P(zero numbers match). This is the probability that none of her four numbers are in the lottery's four numbers. So

---------------

, the lottery picks 4 numbers from 10, and Jen has 4 numbers. The number of ways the lottery can pick 4 numbers that don't include any of Jen's numbers is C

---------------

(10 - 4, 4) = C(6,4) = 15. So, the probability is 15 / C(10,4) = 15/210 = 1/14.

Next, P(exactly one number matches). This is the probability that exactly one of her four numbers is picked

---------------

 by the lottery. To compute this, we can think: choose 1 number from Jen's 4, and 3 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers not

---------------

 in Jen's set. So, the number of favorable outcomes is C(4,1)*C(6,3). Let's calculate that:

---------------

 C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, total is 4*20=80. Therefore

---------------

, the probability is 80 / 210.

So, P(less than two numbers match) is P(zero) + P(one) = (15 + 80)/210 = 95/210.

Therefore

---------------

, P(B) = 1 - 95/210 = (210 - 95)/210 = 115/210. Simpl

---------------

ify that: 115 and 210 are both divisible by 5. 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42. So

---------------

, P(B) is 23/42.

Wait, hold on, let me double-check that calculation. 

---------------

15 (for zero) plus 80 (for one) is 95. 210 - 95 is 115, so

---------------

 yes, 115/210. Divided by 5, 23/42. That

---------------

 seems correct.

So, P(A) is 1/210, and P(B) is 23/42.

Therefore

---------------

, the conditional probability P(A|B) is (1/210) / (23/42). Let's compute that.

First, write

---------------

 it as (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23). Simplify 42/210: that's 1/5. So, it

---------------

's (1/5) / 23 = 1/(5*23) = 1/115.

Wait, let

---------------

 me do that again. (1/210) divided by (23/42) is equal to (1/210) * (42/23). 

---------------

42 divided by 210 is 1/5. So, 1/210 * 42/23 = (42)/(210*23) = (1/5)/

---------------

23 = 1/(115). So, yes, 1/115.

But wait, is

---------------

 that correct? 1/210 divided by 23/42 is equal to (1/210)*(42/23). 

---------------

42/210 is 1/5, so it's (1/5)*(1/23) = 1/115. So

---------------

, yes, that's correct.

But wait, 1/115 seems a bit low. Let me think again

---------------

. So, the probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is 1/115. Hmm

---------------

, is that right? Let me think about the numbers again.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating P(B). Let me re

---------------

-examine that.

P(B) is the probability of at least two matches. So, P(B) = 1 - [P(zero) + P(one)]. P

---------------

(zero) is C(6,4)/C(10,4) = 15/210.

---------------

 P(one) is C(4,1)*C(6,3)/C(10,4) = 4*20=

---------------

80, so 80/210. So, 15 + 80 = 95. So

---------------

, 1 - 95/210 = 115/210 = 23/42. That

---------------

 seems correct.

So, P(A|B) is (1/210) / (23/42) = (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23). 

---------------

42 is 1/5 of 210, so 1/5 * 1/23 = 1/115. So

---------------

, yes, that seems correct.

Wait, but intuitively, if she has already won a prize (at least two matches), the

---------------

 chance that it's the grand prize is 1/115? That seems low, but considering that the grand prize is a

---------------

 very specific case, maybe that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute it as the number of favorable cases over the number of possible prize-winning cases.

Wait

---------------

, another approach: instead of computing probabilities, compute the number of favorable cases for A and the number of cases for B, then take

---------------

 the ratio.

So, the total number of possible lottery draws is C(10,4)=210.

Number of cases

---------------

 where she wins the grand prize (A): 1.

Number of cases where she wins a prize (B): all cases where at least two of her numbers are in

---------------

 the lottery draw.

So, how many such cases are there?

Number of ways to choose 4 numbers that include at least two of Jen's four numbers. 



---------------

Alternatively, the number of 4-number draws that intersect Jen's 4 numbers in at least two numbers.

So, to

---------------

 compute the number of such draws, it's equal to total draws minus draws with less than two matches.

Which is the same as earlier

---------------

: 210 - [C(6,4) + C(4,1)*C(6,3)] = 210 - [15 + 80] = 210 - 95 = 115.

So, the number of cases where she wins a prize is 115.

Therefore

---------------

, the conditional probability is 1 (number of grand prize cases) divided by 115 (number of prize cases). So, 1/115. Which

---------------

 matches what I found earlier.

So, that seems to confirm that the conditional probability is indeed 1/115.

Therefore

---------------

, m is 1, n is 115. Are they coprime? 1 and 115 share no common factors besides 1, so yes. Therefore, m + n is 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, but

---------------

 let me just think again if I did everything correctly. Sometimes, in probability, it's easy to make an oversight.

Another

---------------

 way to think about it: given that at least two numbers match, what's the chance that all four match. So, the

---------------

 conditional probability is the number of grand prize draws (1) over the number of prize draws (115). So, 

---------------

1/115.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use hypergeometric distribution concepts here. The probability of k successes (matches) in the draw.



---------------

But I think the way I approached it is correct. So, I think 1/115 is the right probability.

Thus

---------------

, the answer is 1 + 115 = 116.


The problem involves calculating the conditional probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize in a lottery. 

First

---------------

, we determine the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10, which is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \).

-

---------------

 **Probability of winning the grand prize (P(A))**: This occurs when all four of Jen's numbers are chosen. There is only 1 favorable outcome, so \( P(A) = \frac{1}{210} \).

- **Probability of winning a prize (P(B))**: This is the probability of having at least two numbers match. We calculate the complement (

---------------

probability of having fewer than two matches) and subtract it from 1:
  - **Zero matches**: The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the remaining 6 is \( \binom{6}{4} = 15 \), so \( P(\text{zero}) = \frac{15}{210} \).
  - **One match**: The number of ways to choose 1 number from Jen's 4 and 3 from the remaining 6 is \( \binom{4}{1} \times \binom{6}{3} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \), so \( P(\text{one}) = \frac{80}{210} \).
  - **

---------------

Total for fewer than two matches**: \( \frac{15 + 80}{210} = \frac{95}{210} \).
  - **Thus

---------------

, \( P(B) = 1 - \frac{95}{210} = \frac{115}{210} = \frac{23}{42} \).

The

---------------

 conditional probability \( P(A|B) \) is calculated as:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{23}{42}} = \frac{1}{210} \times \frac{42}{23} = \frac{1}{115}.
\]

Thus

---------------

, \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \), which are coprime. Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).
