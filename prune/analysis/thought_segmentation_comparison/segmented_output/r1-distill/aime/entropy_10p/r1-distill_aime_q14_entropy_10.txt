Okay, so I need to figure out how many paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try

---------------

 to understand the problem first.

An 8x8 grid means we're talking about a grid with 8 rows and 8 columns, right? So,

---------------

 the grid has points from (0,0) to (8,8). A path from the lower left corner (0,0) to the upper right corner (8,8) would

---------------

 consist of moving right and up steps. Since each step is either right or up, the total number of steps required is 16: 8 rights and 8 ups.

Now

---------------

, the problem is about paths that change direction exactly four times. Wait, what does that mean? So, each time the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. So

---------------

, for example, if you start by moving right, then switch to up, that's one change. Then switch back to right, that's another change, and so on.

Let

---------------

 me think: how many direction changes are there in a path? Well, the minimum number of direction changes is 1.

---------------

 For example, moving all the way right first and then all the way up. That's just one direction change. Similarly, if you go

---------------

 all up first then right, that's also one change.

The maximum number of direction changes would be when you alternate directions as much as possible. Since

---------------

 there are 16 steps, the maximum number of changes would be 15, but that's not possible because you need

---------------

 at least two steps in each direction to change. Wait, actually, maybe not. Wait, if you alternate right and up each

---------------

 time, but you have 8 rights and 8 ups, the maximum number of direction changes would be 15,

---------------

 but that's only possible if you have 8 rights and 8 ups. Wait, no, wait. If you have

---------------

 8 rights and 8 ups, each time you switch, you use one step. So, starting right, then up, then right, etc

---------------

. But you have 8 rights and 8 ups, so you can have 15 switches. Wait, no, that

---------------

 can't be. Because each switch requires at least one step in each direction. So, if you have 8 rights and 8 ups, the

---------------

 maximum number of direction changes is 15, but that would require you to have 1 step in each direction alternately. Wait

---------------

, but that would require 16 steps, which is correct. So, for example, R, U, R, U,...,

---------------

 ending with U. That's 15 direction changes.

But in our case, we need exactly four direction changes. So, how

---------------

 do we model this?

I think it's helpful to model the path as a sequence of runs. A run is a consecutive sequence of steps in the same direction. So, each

---------------

 time the direction changes, a new run begins.

If there are four direction changes, that would mean the path has five runs. Because the number of runs is one more than the number of direction changes. So, for

---------------

 example, if you have no direction changes, you have one run. One direction change gives two runs, etc. So, four direction changes give

---------------

 five runs.

Now, these five runs consist of alternating right and up steps. So, the first run could be right or up, and

---------------

 then it alternates.

Since we need to reach (8,8), the total number of right steps is 8 and the total number of up steps is 8.

So

---------------

, the runs are a partition of the 8 right steps and 8 up steps into five runs, with the runs alternating between right and up.

But

---------------

 wait, the number of runs must be odd or even? Let's see: since the path starts at (0,0) and ends at (8,8), the

---------------

 number of runs must be either starting with right or up, and then alternates.

But the total number of runs is five. So

---------------

, five runs can be either starting with right and then up, right, up, etc., or starting with up, then right, up, etc.

So

---------------

, two cases: starting with right or starting with up.

In each case, the number of runs in each direction will differ by at most one.

Let

---------------

 me consider starting with right. Then, the runs would be: right, up, right, up, right. So, three

---------------

 right runs and two up runs.

Similarly, starting with up, the runs would be up, right, up, right, up. So, three up runs and two right runs.

But

---------------

 wait, in both cases, since there are five runs, starting with right or up, the number of right runs and up runs would

---------------

 differ by one. So, if starting with right, you have three right runs and two up runs. If starting with up, you

---------------

 have three up runs and two right runs.

But in our case, the total right steps are 8 and the total up steps are 8. So, in

---------------

 the first case, starting with right, we have three right runs and two up runs. So, the sum of the lengths of the right runs is 8, and the sum of the lengths of the up runs is 8.

Similarly, in

---------------

 the second case, starting with up, we have three up runs and two right runs.

So, in each case, the

---------------

 number of runs is five, with three runs in one direction and two in the other.

So, for each case, we

---------------

 can model it as a stars and bars problem. Wait, yes, because the runs are sequences of steps in each direction, so

---------------

 the number of ways to partition 8 steps into, say, three runs is the number of compositions of 8 into three parts, which is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21. Similarly for the other direction.

Wait

---------------

, but in the starting with right case: the number of ways is the number of compositions of 8 into three right runs multiplied

---------------

 by the number of compositions of 8 into two up runs.

Similarly for starting with up.

So, the total number of paths is

---------------

 2 * [C(7,2) * C(7,1)].

Wait, let me check that.

So

---------------

, starting with right: three right runs and two up runs.

Each right run has at least one step, because you can't have a run of zero steps.

---------------

 Similarly, each up run has at least one step.

So, the number of ways to partition 8 right steps into three runs is equal

---------------

 to the number of solutions to r1 + r2 + r3 = 8, where each ri >=1. That

---------------

's C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21.

Similarly, the number of ways to partition 8 up steps into two runs is C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1) = 7.

So, the number of paths starting with right is 21 * 7 = 147.

Similarly, starting with up: three up runs and two right runs. The number of ways is the

---------------

 same: 21 *7 =147.

So, total number of paths is 147 +147 = 294.

Wait, so

---------------

 is that the answer? 294.

But wait, let me think again. Is this correct?

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 not. Because when starting with right, the number of up runs is two, so the number of up runs is two,

---------------

 each with at least one step. So, the number of compositions is C(7,1)=7. Similarly, starting

---------------

 with up, the right runs are two, so C(7,1)=7.

But wait, wait, when starting with right, the

---------------

 number of up runs is two, so the number of compositions is C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1)=7. Similarly

---------------

, the right runs are three, so C(7,2)=21.

So, yeah, 21*7=147 for

---------------

 each case, and total 294.

But wait, let me think about another way to model this.

Another approach: the

---------------

 number of direction changes is four, so five runs.

Each run alternates between right and up. So, for the starting

---------------

 direction, it's either right or up.

If starting with right, then the runs are R, U, R, U, R.

Each

---------------

 R run has at least one step, each U run has at least one step.

So, the number of R runs is three, and

---------------

 the number of U runs is two.

Similarly, the total R steps are 8, so we have to distribute 8 steps

---------------

 into three runs, each run at least one step. That's C(8-1,3-1)=C(7,2)=21.

Similarly, the

---------------

 U steps are 8, distributed into two runs, each at least one step: C(8-1,2-1)=C(7,1)=7.

So

---------------

, the number of paths starting with R is 21*7=147.

Similarly, starting with U: three

---------------

 U runs and two R runs.

Number of ways: C(8-1,3-1)=21 for U runs, and C(8-1,2-1)=7 for R runs. So, 21*7=147.

Total number

---------------

 of paths: 147+147=294.

So, that seems consistent.

Wait, but I

---------------

'm wondering if the starting direction affects the count, but in both cases, the number is the same, so 294 in

---------------

 total.

But wait, another way to think about this is using the concept of compositions.

The number of compositions of 8 into k parts is C(7, k-1), as

---------------

 I used earlier.

So, yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, I can think of it as arranging the steps.

Wait

---------------

, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about how direction changes occur.

Each time you switch from right to up or up to right, that's a direction change. So, four

---------------

 direction changes mean five runs.

So, the first run could be either right or up. So, two possibilities for the starting direction.

Each

---------------

 subsequent run alternates direction.

So, the number of runs in each direction depends on whether the number of runs is odd or even. Wait

---------------

, in our case, five runs, which is odd. So, starting with right, the runs would be R, U, R, U, R:

---------------

 three R runs and two U runs.

Similarly, starting with U, it's U, R, U, R, U: three U runs and two R runs.

So

---------------

, as I did before, the number of ways is 2 * [C(7,2)*C(7,1)].

So

---------------

, that's 2*(21*7)=294.

Hmm, that seems correct.

Wait, but maybe

---------------

 I should check with smaller grids to see if the reasoning holds.

Suppose I have a 2x2 grid. Paths

---------------

 from (0,0) to (2,2). How many paths change direction exactly two times?

Wait, let's compute

---------------

 it.

First, the total number of paths is C(4,2)=6.

Now, how many of these paths change direction exactly two times.

Wait

---------------

, in a 2x2 grid, a path from (0,0) to (2,2) can have 

---------------

0, 1, or 2 direction changes.

Wait, no. Wait, starting with right, right, up, up: that's one

---------------

 direction change. Similarly, right, up, right, up: that's three direction changes.

Wait, maybe in a 2x2 grid, the

---------------

 maximum number of direction changes is 3.

Wait, let me think. Each time you switch direction, that's a change. So, for

---------------

 four steps, the number of direction changes can be 1, 3, or something else?

Wait, for a 2x2 grid, the

---------------

 path has four steps: two rights and two ups.

If the path is RRUU: one direction change.

If it's RURU: three direction changes.

If

---------------

 it's RUUR: two direction changes.

Wait, so in this case, the number of direction changes can be 1, 2, or 3.

So, how

---------------

 many paths have exactly two direction changes?

Wait, for 2x2 grid, let's list all possible paths and count the

---------------

 direction changes.

Possible paths:

1. RRUU: direction changes once (after two steps).

2. RURU: direction changes three times (after first

---------------

 R, then U, then R, then U).

3. RUUR: direction changes twice (after R, U, then R again at

---------------

 step 3).

4. UURR: same as RRUU, but mirrored: direction changes once.

5. URUR: same as RURU, but

---------------

 starting with U: direction changes three times.

6. URRU: same as RUUR, mirrored: direction changes twice.

So, the

---------------

 paths with exactly two direction changes are RUUR and URRU. So, two paths.

Now, using our formula:

---------------

 for a 2x2 grid, n=2, m=2.

Number of direction changes is two. So, number

---------------

 of runs is three.

So, starting with R or U.

Case 1: starting with R. Then runs are R, U, R. So, two R runs and one U run.

Wait

---------------

, no, three runs: R, U, R. So, two R runs and one U run.

Total R steps: 2, split

---------------

 into two runs: each run at least one step. So, number of compositions: C(2-1, 2-1)=C(1,1)=1.

Similarly, U steps: 2, split into one run: only one way.

So, number of paths starting with R: 1*1=1.

Case 2: starting with U. Runs are U, R, U.

Total

---------------

 U steps: 2, split into two runs: C(1,1)=1.

Total R steps: 2, split into one run: 1 way.

So, number of paths starting with U: 1*1=1.

Total paths: 1+1=2. Which matches our manual count.

So, the

---------------

 formula works for the 2x2 grid.

Similarly, let's test for a 1x1 grid. Wait, a

---------------

 1x1 grid would have a path of two steps: right and up.

Number of direction changes: one.

But

---------------

 according to the formula, for n=1, m=1, direction changes=1.

Number of runs=2.

Starting with R or U.

Case

---------------

 1: starting with R: runs R, U. Each run has 1 step. So, number of compositions: R

---------------

 steps split into one run: 1 way. U steps split into one run:1 way. So, 1*1=1.

Case 2: starting with U: same, 1*1=1.

Total paths: 2. Which is correct, because the

---------------

 two paths are RU and UR, each with one direction change.

So, the formula works.

So, going back to the original problem,

---------------

 it seems that 294 is the correct answer.

Wait, but wait, another thought: in the 8x8 grid, the

---------------

 number of direction changes is four, which implies five runs. But is that possible? Because in each run, you have at least one step. So, for

---------------

 five runs, you need at least five steps, but our path has 16 steps, so that's fine.

But

---------------

 let me think if there's another way to model this. Maybe using combinations with direction changes.

Wait, another approach: the

---------------

 number of direction changes is four. So, the path alternates direction four times.

Each direction change can occur either from right to up or up to right.

But perhaps

---------------

 another way is to model the path as a sequence of moves, and count the number of times the direction changes.

Wait, but

---------------

 that might complicate things. I think the initial approach is correct.

So, to recap:

- The path has four direction changes, so

---------------

 five runs.

- Each run is either right or up.

- The runs alternate direction.

- The number of runs in each direction is either three and

---------------

 two, depending on starting direction.

- For each starting direction, the number of ways is C(7,2)*C(7,1)=21*7=147.

- Since

---------------

 starting direction can be right or up, total is 294.

Therefore, the answer should be 294.


The problem involves counting the number of paths from the lower left corner to the upper right corner of an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times. Each path consists of 16 steps (8 right and 8 up). A direction change occurs when the path switches from moving right to up or vice versa.

To solve this, we model

---------------

 the path as a sequence of runs (consecutive steps in the same direction). Four direction changes imply five runs. These runs alternate between right and up steps. Depending on whether the path starts with a right or up step, the runs will be distributed as follows:

- **Starting with right**: Three right runs and two up runs.
- **Starting with up**: Three up runs and two right runs.

For each case, we calculate the number of ways to partition the 8 steps in each direction into the required number of runs. This is done using the stars and bars method, where the number of compositions of 8 into k

---------------

 parts is given by \( \binom{8-1}{k-1} \).

- **Right runs**: For

---------------

 three right runs, the number of ways is \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \).
- **Up runs**: For two up runs, the number of ways is \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \).

Thus, the number of paths starting with right is \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \). Similarly, the number of paths starting with up is also \( 147 \). Adding both cases gives the total number of paths:

\[
147 + 147 = 294
\]

Therefore, the number of paths that change direction exactly four times is:
