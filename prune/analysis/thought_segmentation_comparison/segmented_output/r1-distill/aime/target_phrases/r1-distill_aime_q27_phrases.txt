Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (I think that's what they're calling point I) to each face. The distance should be in a particular form, and then I have to find the sum m + n + p. Hmm.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The tetrahedron has opposite edges equal: AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), and BC = AD = sqrt(89). So, it's like a symmetrical tetrahedron where each pair of opposite edges are equal. That probably means it's a kind of isosceles tetrahedron or something like that.

Now, the point I is inside the tetrahedron such that its distances to each of the four faces are equal. I remember that in a tetrahedron, the incenter (if it exists) is the point equidistant from all four faces. For a tetrahedron to have an incenter, it must be "tangential," meaning that there exists a sphere (insphere) tangent to all four faces. I think that requires the tetrahedron to be isohedral or something like that, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the condition of opposite edges being equal ensures that it is tangential.

So, assuming that such a point I exists, how do I find the distance from I to each face? I recall that in a tetrahedron, the volume can be expressed as (1/3) * base area * height. But since the inradius is involved, maybe the volume can also be expressed in terms of the inradius and the total surface area?



---------------

Wait, right! For a tetrahedron, the volume V is equal to (1/3) times the sum of the areas of the four faces multiplied by the inradius r. So, V = (1/3) * (A1 + A2 + A3 + A4) * r, where A1, A2, A3, A4 are the areas of the four faces. So, if I can find the volume of the tetrahedron and the areas of each face, I can solve for r, which is the distance we're looking for.

So, the plan is:

1. Calculate the volume V of tetrahedron ABCD.
2. Calculate the areas of each of the four faces.
3. Sum the areas to get the total surface area S.
4. Use the formula V = (1/3) * S * r to solve for r.

Alright, let's tackle each step.

First, step 1: Calculating the volume V. Since the tetrahedron has opposite edges equal, maybe there's a formula for the volume in terms of the edges. I think there's a formula for the volume of a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, but I'm not exactly sure. 

---------------

Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinates.

Yes, using coordinates might be a good approach. Let me try to assign coordinates to the vertices such that the symmetries of the tetrahedron are reflected.

Let me place the points in 3D space in a symmetric way. Maybe set the centroid at the origin or something, but perhaps a better approach is to position the points such that the opposite edges are equal and the coordinates are symmetric.

Let me think: in a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, the coordinates can be set such that the midpoints of opposite edges are the same. 

---------------

Wait, maybe I can use the following coordinate system.

Let me denote the points as A, B, C, D. Since AB = CD, AC = BD, and BC = AD, it's like a symmetrical tetrahedron where each pair of opposite edges are equal. So, perhaps it's a tetrahedron where each pair of opposite edges are equal and perpendicular? Hmm, not necessarily, but perhaps.



---------------

Alternatively, I remember that for such a tetrahedron, it's called a "disphenoid," which is a tetrahedron where each pair of opposite edges are equal. So, in a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles, right? 

---------------

Wait, no, not necessarily. If all faces are congruent, it's a regular tetrahedron, but in a disphenoid, the faces come in congruent pairs. So, in this case, since the edges are given as AB = CD, AC = BD, and BC = AD, it's a disphenoid.

I think in a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2) ) / 72, but I'm not sure. Maybe I need to derive the volume.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe using coordinates is better. Let's try to assign coordinates to the points.

Let me set point A at (x, y, z), point B at (-x, -y, z), point C at (-x, y, -z), and point D at (x, -y, -z). This way, the coordinates are symmetric, and opposite edges should have equal lengths.



---------------

Wait, let me check. Let me compute AB, CD, AC, BD, BC, and AD.

Point A: (x, y, z)
Point B: (-x, -y, z)
Point C: (-x, y, -z)
Point D: (x, -y, -z)

Compute AB: distance between A and B.

AB^2 = (x - (-x))^2 + (y - (-y))^2 + (z - z)^2 = (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0 = 4x^2 + 4y^2.

Similarly, CD is the distance between C and D.

C: (-x, y, -z); D: (x, -y, -z)
CD^2 = ( -x - x )^2 + (y - (-y))^2 + (-z - (-z))^2 = (-2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0 = 4x^2 +4y^2.

So AB^2 = CD^2, which is consistent with AB=CD= sqrt(41). So 4x^2 +4y^2 = 41.

Similarly, compute AC: distance between A and C.

A: (x,y,z); C: (-x,y,-z)
AC^2 = (x - (-x))^2 + (y - y)^2 + (z - (-z))^2 = (2x)^2 + 0 + (2z)^2 = 4x^2 + 4z^2.

Similarly, BD is the distance between B and D.

B: (-x,-y,z); D: (x,-y,-z)
BD^2 = (-x -x)^2 + (-y - (-y))^2 + (z - (-z))^2 = (-2x)^2 + 0 + (2z)^2 = 4x^2 +4z^2.

So AC=BD= sqrt(80), so 4x^2 +4z^2=80.

Similarly, compute BC: distance between B and C.

B: (-x,-y,z); C: (-x,y,-z)
BC^2 = (-x - (-x))^2 + (-y - y)^2 + (z - (-z))^2 = 0 + (-2y)^2 + (2z)^2 = 4y^2 +4z^2.

Similarly, AD is the distance between A and D.

A: (x,y,z); D: (x,-y,-z)
AD^2 = (x -x)^2 + (y - (-y))^2 + (z - (-z))^2 = 0 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2 =4y^2 +4z^2.

So BC=AD= sqrt(89), so 4y^2 +4z^2=89.

Now, we have three equations:

1. 4x^2 +4y^2 =41 → x^2 + y^2 = 41/4.
2. 4x^2 +4z^2=80 → x^2 + z^2 = 20.
3. 4y^2 +4z^2=89 → y^2 + z^2 = 89/4.

So, we have:

Equation 1: x² + y² = 41/4.
Equation 2: x² + z² = 20.
Equation 3: y² + z² = 89/4.

Let me write these as:

1. x² + y² = 10.25.
2. x² + z² = 20.
3. y² + z² = 22.25.

Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2: (x² + z²) - (x² + y²) = 20 - 10.25 → z² - y² = 9.75.

From equation 3: y² + z² =22.25.

So, we have:

z² - y² = 9.75,
z² + y² =22.25.

Let me add these two equations:

2z² = 32 → z²=16 → z=4 or z=-4. Since we are dealing with coordinates, z can be positive or negative, but since we are squaring it, the sign doesn't matter. So z=4.

Then, from equation 3: y² + 16 =22.25 → y²=6.25 → y=2.5 or y=-2.5.

Similarly, from equation 1: x² + y²=10.25 → x² +6.25=10.25 → x²=4 → x=2 or x=-2.

So, we have x=2 or x=-2, y=2.5 or y=-2.5, and z=4 or z=-4.



---------------

But wait, in the coordinate assignments earlier, I had points A, B, C, D with specific signs. Let me recall:

A: (x, y, z)
B: (-x, -y, z)
C: (-x, y, -z)
D: (x, -y, -z)

So, to ensure the coordinates are consistent, I need to assign the signs correctly. Let's choose x=2, y=2.5, z=4.

So, points are:

A: (2, 2.5, 4)
B: (-2, -2.5, 4)
C: (-2, 2.5, -4)
D: (2, -2.5, -4)



---------------

Wait, but let me check the coordinates again. Let me verify if with these coordinates, the distances match.

Compute AB: distance between A and B.

A: (2, 2.5, 4)
B: (-2, -2.5, 4)
AB² = (2 - (-2))² + (2.5 - (-2.5))² + (4 -4)² = (4)^2 + (5)^2 + 0 = 16 +25=41. Correct, since AB= sqrt(41).

AC: distance between A and C.

A: (2, 2.5, 4)
C: (-2, 2.5, -4)
AC² = (2 - (-2))² + (2.5 -2.5)^2 + (4 - (-4))² = (4)^2 +0 + (8)^2=16 +64=80. Correct, since AC= sqrt(80).

BC: distance between B and C.

B: (-2, -2.5, 4)
C: (-2, 2.5, -4)
BC² = (0)^2 + (5)^2 + (-8)^2=25 +64=89. Correct, since BC= sqrt(89).

Looks good. So, with x=2, y=2.5, z=4, all edge lengths are satisfied.

Now, with these coordinates, I can compute the volume of the tetrahedron.

The volume of a tetrahedron can be found using the scalar triple product formula:

V = | (AB · (AC × AD)) | / 6



---------------

But wait, actually, I can use the coordinates of the four points to compute the volume.

The formula is:

V = |det(B - A, C - A, D - A)| / 6

Where B - A, C - A, D - A are vectors from point A to points B, C, D.

So, let's compute vectors AB, AC, AD.



---------------

Wait, no, vectors AB, AC, AD are from A to B, A to C, A to D.



---------------

Wait, no, actually, to compute the volume, we need three vectors emanating from the same point, say A, so vectors AB, AC, AD.

So, vectors:

AB = B - A = (-2 -2, -2.5 -2.5, 4 -4) = (-4, -5, 0)



---------------

Wait, hold on, coordinates of A are (2, 2.5, 4).

Coordinates of B are (-2, -2.5, 4).

So, vector AB = B - A = (-2 -2, -2.5 -2.5, 4 -4) = (-4, -5, 0).

Similarly, vector AC = C - A = (-2 -2, 2.5 -2.5, -4 -4) = (-4, 0, -8).

Vector AD = D - A = (2 -2, -2.5 -2.5, -4 -4) = (0, -5, -8).

So, the vectors are:

AB = (-4, -5, 0)
AC = (-4, 0, -8)
AD = (0, -5, -8)

Now, the volume is the absolute value of the scalar triple product divided by 6.

Compute the scalar triple product: AB · (AC × AD).

First, find AC × AD.

Let me compute the cross product AC × AD.

AC = (-4, 0, -8)
AD = (0, -5, -8)

The cross product is determinant:

|i   j   k |
|-4  0 -8|
|0 -5 -8|

Calculating the determinant:

i*(0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) - j*(-4*(-8) - (-8)*0) + k*(-4*(-5) - 0*0)

Compute each component:

i: 0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5) = 0 - 40 = -40 → i*(-40)
j: - [ (-4)*(-8) - (-8)*0 ] = - [32 -0] = -32 → j*(-32)
k: (-4)*(-5) -0*0=20 -0=20 → k*20

So, AC × AD = (-40, -32, 20)

Now, compute AB · (AC × AD)

AB = (-4, -5, 0)

Dot product with (-40, -32, 20):

= (-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*20
= 160 + 160 + 0
= 320

So, the scalar triple product is 320.

Hence, volume V = |320| / 6 = 320/6 = 160/3 ≈ 53.333...

So, V = 160/3.



---------------

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check the calculations.

First, cross product AC × AD:

i component: (0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) = 0 - 40 = -40.

j component: - [ (-4)*(-8) - (-8)*0 ] = - [32 - 0] = -32.

k component: (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 =20 -0=20.

Yes, correct. So cross product is (-40, -32, 20).

Dot product with AB = (-4, -5, 0):

(-4)*(-40) = 160,

(-5)*(-32)=160,

0*20=0.

Total: 160 + 160 =320.

Yes, correct. So, scalar triple product is 320, so volume is 320/6 = 160/3.

So, V=160/3.

Now, moving on to step 2: calculating the areas of each face.

The tetrahedron has four triangular faces: ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD.



---------------

Wait, but given the symmetry, maybe the areas come in pairs. Since opposite edges are equal, perhaps opposite faces have the same area.



---------------

Wait, let's see: Each face is a triangle with sides of certain lengths.

Let me list the faces:

1. Face ABC: edges AB, BC, AC.
2. Face ABD: edges AB, BD, AD.
3. Face ACD: edges AC, CD, AD.
4. Face BCD: edges BC, CD, BD.

Given the edge lengths, since AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD, each pair of opposite edges are equal. So, perhaps the areas of opposite faces are equal.

Let me check.

Compute the area of each face.

First, let me compute area of face ABC.

Face ABC has sides AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), AC = sqrt(80).

So, sides a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(89), c = sqrt(80).



---------------

Wait, let me compute the area using Heron's formula.

Heron's formula: area = sqrt[s(s -a)(s -b)(s -c)], where s = (a + b + c)/2.

Compute s for triangle ABC.

s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(89) + sqrt(80)) / 2.

Hmm, that seems a bit messy, but let's try.



---------------

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the area using vectors.

Since I have coordinates for points A, B, C, I can compute the area as half the magnitude of the cross product of vectors AB and AC.

So, for face ABC:

Vectors AB and AC are:

AB = (-4, -5, 0)
AC = (-4, 0, -8)

Compute the cross product AB × AC.

AB × AC = |i   j   k|
             -4  -5  0
             -4   0  -8

Calculating determinant:

i*(-5*(-8) - 0*0) - j*(-4*(-8) - 0*(-4)) + k*(-4*0 - (-5)*(-4))

Compute each component:

i: (-5)*(-8) - 0 =40 → i*40
j: - [ (-4)*(-8) -0 ] = - [32] → j*(-32)
k: 0 - (5*4)= -20 → k*(-20)

So, AB × AC = (40, -32, -20)

Magnitude squared: 40² + (-32)² + (-20)² =1600 +1024 +400= 3024

So, magnitude is sqrt(3024). Let's simplify that.

3024: Divide by 16: 3024/16=189. So sqrt(16*189)=4*sqrt(189).

189 factors: 9*21=9*3*7. So sqrt(189)=3*sqrt(21).

Thus, magnitude is 4*3*sqrt(21)=12 sqrt(21).

So, area of ABC is (1/2)*12 sqrt(21)=6 sqrt(21).



---------------

Wait, that's the area of face ABC.

Similarly, since the tetrahedron is symmetrical, perhaps the opposite face ACD has the same area.

But let me confirm.

Compute area of face ACD.

Points A, C, D.

Vectors AC and AD.



---------------

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute using vectors from point A.

Vectors AC = (-4, 0, -8)
AD = (0, -5, -8)

Compute cross product AC × AD.

AC × AD = |i   j   k|
             -4   0  -8
              0  -5  -8

Determinant:

i*(0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) - j*(-4*(-8) - (-8)*0) + k*(-4*(-5) - 0*0)

Compute each component:

i: 0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5) = 0 -40 = -40 → i*(-40)
j: - [ (-4)*(-8) - (-8)*0 ] = - [32 -0] = -32 → j*(-32)
k: (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 =20 -0=20 → k*20

So, cross product AC × AD = (-40, -32, 20)

Magnitude squared: (-40)^2 + (-32)^2 +20^2=1600 +1024 +400=3024.

Same as before, so magnitude is 12 sqrt(21).

Hence, area of ACD is (1/2)*12 sqrt(21)=6 sqrt(21).

So, faces ABC and ACD have the same area: 6 sqrt(21).

Similarly, let's compute the area of face ABD.

Face ABD has sides AB, BD, AD.



---------------

Wait, AB = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80), AD = sqrt(89).

Wait, same as face ABC but with different side lengths.



---------------

Alternatively, since the tetrahedron is symmetrical, perhaps the areas are the same. Wait, no, in the previous case, the areas were same because of the way the edges were arranged.



---------------

Wait, let me compute the area using vectors.

Face ABD: points A, B, D.

Vectors AB and AD.

AB = (-4, -5, 0)
AD = (0, -5, -8)

Compute cross product AB × AD.

AB × AD = |i   j   k|
             -4  -5   0
              0  -5  -8

Compute determinant:

i*(-5*(-8) - 0*(-5)) - j*(-4*(-8) - 0*0) + k*(-4*(-5) - (-5)*0)

Compute each component:

i: (-5)*(-8) -0=40 → i*40
j: - [ (-4)*(-8) -0 ] = - [32] → j*(-32)
k: (-4)*(-5) -0=20 → k*20

So, cross product AB × AD = (40, -32, 20)

Magnitude squared:40² + (-32)^2 +20^2=1600 +1024 +400=3024.

Same as before, so magnitude is 12 sqrt(21).

Area is half that: 6 sqrt(21).

Similarly, face BCD should have the same area. Let me compute it just to confirm.

Face BCD: points B, C, D.

Vectors BC and BD.



---------------

Wait, let me get vectors from point B to C and D.

Point B: (-2, -2.5,4)
Point C: (-2,2.5,-4)
Point D: (2,-2.5,-4)

Compute vectors BC and BD.



---------------

Wait, vectors BC and BD.

Wait, actually, for the area, it's better to compute vectors from point B: vectors BC and BD.



---------------

Wait, vector BC = C - B = (-2 - (-2), 2.5 - (-2.5), -4 -4) = (0,5,-8).

Vector BD = D - B = (2 - (-2), -2.5 - (-2.5), -4 -4) = (4,0,-8).

Compute cross product BC × BD.

BC × BD = |i   j   k|
              0   5  -8
              4   0  -8

Determinant:

i*(5*(-8) - (-8)*0) - j*(0*(-8) - (-8)*4) + k*(0*0 -5*4)

Compute each component:

i: 5*(-8) -0= -40 → i*(-40)
j: - [0*(-8) - (-8)*4 ] = - [0 +32 ] = -32 → j*(-32)
k: 0 -20= -20 → k*(-20)

So, cross product BC × BD = (-40, -32, -20)

Magnitude squared: (-40)^2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2=1600 +1024 +400=3024.

Same as before, magnitude is 12 sqrt(21).

So, area is 6 sqrt(21).

Thus, all four faces have the same area: 6 sqrt(21).



---------------

Wait, that's interesting. So, the total surface area S is 4 *6 sqrt(21) =24 sqrt(21).



---------------

Wait, so S=24 sqrt(21).

Earlier, we found the volume V=160/3.

Now, the formula is V = (1/3) * S * r.

So, 160/3 = (1/3) * 24 sqrt(21) * r.

Simplify:

Multiply both sides by 3: 160 = 24 sqrt(21) * r.

So, r = 160 / (24 sqrt(21)).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Divide numerator and denominator by 8: 20 / (3 sqrt(21)).

Rationalize the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(21):

r = (20 sqrt(21)) / (3 *21) = (20 sqrt(21)) /63.

So, r=20 sqrt(21)/63.



---------------

Wait, let me check the calculations again.

Yes, V =160/3, S=24 sqrt(21).

So,

r = (3V)/S = (3*(160/3)) / (24 sqrt(21)) = 160 / (24 sqrt(21)) = (20)/(3 sqrt(21)) = (20 sqrt(21))/63.

Yes, that's correct.

Now, the problem says the distance can be written as m sqrt(n)/p, where m and p are coprime, and n is square-free.

Looking at 20 sqrt(21)/63.

Check if 20 and 63 are coprime: 20 factors are 2^2 *5, 63 is 7*3^2. No common factors, so yes, they are coprime.

n=21, which factors into 3*7, both primes, neither squared. So, n is square-free.

Thus, m=20, n=21, p=63.



---------------

Wait, but 20 and 63 are coprime? 20 and 63 share any common factors? 20 is 2²*5, 63 is 7*3². So, no common prime factors. So yes, they are coprime.

So, m=20, n=21, p=63.

Therefore, m +n +p=20 +21 +63=104.



---------------

Wait, but wait, is the inradius 20 sqrt(21)/63? Let me just confirm the formula again.

V = (1/3) * S * r.

So, r= 3V/S.

V=160/3, S=24 sqrt(21).

So, r= 3*(160/3) / (24 sqrt(21)) )=160/(24 sqrt(21)).

Simplify 160/24: 160 ÷8=20, 24 ÷8=3. So, 20/3.

Thus, r=20/(3 sqrt(21)) = (20 sqrt(21))/63.

Yes, correct.

So, the distance is 20 sqrt(21)/63, so m=20, n=21, p=63, sum is 104.



---------------

Wait, but let me just double-check all steps because sometimes in these problems, it's easy to make a mistake in the cross product or area calculation.



---------------

Wait, when I calculated the cross product for ABC, I got (40, -32, -20), magnitude squared 40²+32²+20²=1600+1024+400=3024. sqrt(3024)=sqrt(16*189)=4 sqrt(189)=4*3 sqrt(21)=12 sqrt(21). So area is 6 sqrt(21). Correct.

Similarly, all other faces had cross product magnitudes of sqrt(3024)=12 sqrt(21), so areas all 6 sqrt(21). So, total surface area 24 sqrt(21). Correct.

Volume was 160/3. So, 3V=160, then r=160/(24 sqrt(21))=20/(3 sqrt(21))=20 sqrt(21)/63. Correct.

So, the final answer is 20+21+63=104.


To solve the problem, we start by noting that the tetrahedron is a disphenoid with opposite edges equal. We assign coordinates to the vertices to exploit the symmetry. Using the given edge lengths, we determine the coordinates of the vertices and compute the volume using the scalar triple product. We then calculate the areas of each face using the cross product method. Finally, we use the formula relating volume, surface area, and the inradius to find the desired distance.

1. **Volume Calculation**:
   - Using coordinates for the vertices, we compute vectors and apply the scalar triple product.
   - Volume \( V = \frac{160}{3} \).

2. **Face Areas**:
   - Each face is a triangle with sides \( \sqrt{41} \), \( \sqrt{80} \), and \( \sqrt{89} \).
   - Using the cross product, each face area is found to be \( 6\sqrt{21} \).
   - Total surface area \( S = 24\sqrt{21} \).

3. **Inradius Calculation**:
   - Using the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} S r \), we solve for \( r \):
     \[
     r = \frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63}
     \]
   - The distance is expressed as \( \frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63} \), where \( m = 20 \), \( n = 21 \), and \( p = 63 \).

4. **Final Sum**:
   - Summing \( m + n + p \) gives \( 20 + 21 + 63 = 104 \).

\boxed{104}
