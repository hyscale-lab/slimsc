Okay, so I have this problem here: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, let's see. I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but maybe I can convert these logarithmic equations into exponential form to make it easier. Let me write down the given equations.

First equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. 

I know that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So applying that here, it becomes x^10 = y^x. Okay, that's one equation.

Second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

Again, converting that, it becomes y^10 = x^{4y}. So now I have two equations:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

I need to solve for x and y, both greater than 1, and then find their product.

Hmm, these are exponential equations with variables in both the base and the exponent. That seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can take logarithms again or find a way to relate x and y.

Let me write down the equations again:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

I wonder if I can express y in terms of x from the first equation and substitute it into the second equation. Let's try that.

From equation 1: x^10 = y^x.

Taking natural log on both sides: 10 ln x = x ln y.

So, ln y = (10 ln x) / x.

Similarly, from equation 2: y^10 = x^{4y}.

Taking natural log on both sides: 10 ln y = 4y ln x.

So, ln y = (4y ln x) / 10 = (2y ln x)/5.



---------------

Wait, so from equation 1, I have ln y = (10 ln x)/x, and from equation 2, ln y = (2y ln x)/5.

Since both equal ln y, I can set them equal to each other.

So, (10 ln x)/x = (2y ln x)/5.

Hmm, I can cancel ln x from both sides because x and y are greater than 1, so ln x is positive and not zero.

So, 10/x = (2y)/5.

Let's solve for y.

Multiply both sides by x: 10 = (2y x)/5.

Multiply both sides by 5: 50 = 2y x.

Divide both sides by 2: 25 = y x.

So, xy = 25. Hmm, that seems straightforward. 

---------------

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, so from equation 1, I had ln y = (10 ln x)/x, and from equation 2, ln y = (2y ln x)/5.

Setting them equal: 10/x = (2y)/5.

Yes, that's correct. Then 10/x = 2y/5.

Multiply both sides by 5x: 50 = 2xy.

Divide both sides by 2: 25 = xy. So xy is 25. So the product is 25.



---------------

Wait, but let me double-check that. Maybe I should find the actual values of x and y to ensure that they satisfy both equations.

Let me denote xy = 25. So y = 25/x.

Now, substitute y =25/x into equation 1: x^10 = y^x.

So, x^10 = (25/x)^x.

Hmm, that's x^10 = (25^x)/(x^x).

Multiply both sides by x^x: x^{10 + x} = 25^x.

Take natural log: (10 + x) ln x = x ln 25.

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can express it as (10 + x)/x = ln25 / lnx.



---------------

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me take equation 1: x^10 = y^x. And since y =25/x, substitute that in.

So, x^10 = (25/x)^x.

Which is x^10 = (25^x)/(x^x).

Multiply both sides by x^x: x^{10 + x} =25^x.

So, x^{10 + x} =25^x.

Taking both sides to the power of 1/x: x^{(10 + x)/x} =25.

Simplify the exponent: x^{1 + 10/x} =25.

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful yet. Let me try taking the natural logarithm of both sides.

(10 + x) ln x = x ln25.

Hmm, let's write that as:

(10 + x) ln x = x ln25.

Let me rearrange:

10 ln x + x ln x = x ln25.

Bring all terms to one side:

10 ln x + x ln x - x ln25 =0.

Factor x:

10 ln x + x(ln x - ln25)=0.

Hmm, maybe factor ln x:

ln x (10 + x) - x ln25=0.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe express as:

10 ln x = x (ln25 - ln x).

Wait, that might not directly help. Maybe I can write it as:

10 ln x = x ln(25/x).



---------------

Wait, that's interesting because from earlier, we had ln y = (10 ln x)/x, and since y =25/x, ln y = ln(25/x). So let's see.

From equation 1, we had ln y = (10 ln x)/x.

But y =25/x, so ln y = ln(25/x) = ln25 - lnx.

So, ln25 - ln x = (10 ln x)/x.

So, let's write that equation:

ln25 - ln x = (10 ln x)/x.

Multiply both sides by x:

x ln25 - x ln x =10 ln x.

Bring all terms to left:

x ln25 - x ln x -10 ln x=0.

Factor ln x:

x ln25 - ln x (x +10) =0.

So, x ln25 = ln x (x +10).

Hmm, perhaps we can write this as:

ln25 / ln x = (x +10)/x.

Which is the same as:

ln(25)/ln x = 1 + 10/x.



---------------

Alternatively, let me denote t = ln x. Then, ln25 = t * (x +10)/x.

But x is e^t, so x = e^t. So substituting that:

ln25 = t * (e^t +10)/e^t = t*(1 + 10 e^{-t}).

Hmm, that seems complicated. Maybe it's better to try to find x numerically or see if there's an integer solution.



---------------

Wait, let's see if x=5 works. Because 25 is 5 squared, and if x=5, then y=25/5=5. So x=y=5.

Let's check if that satisfies the original equations.

First equation: log_5(5^5) = log_5(3125) =5. 

---------------

But wait, the equation says it's equal to 10. So that doesn't work.

Hmm, so x=5 is not a solution. Hmm.



---------------

Wait, maybe x=25? Then y=25/25=1. But y has to be greater than 1, so y=1 is invalid.

Hmm, what about x=25^(1/ something)?



---------------

Wait, perhaps x and y are the same? Let me test if x=y.

If x=y, then from equation 1: log_x(x^x)=x. But the equation says it's equal to 10, so x=10. Then y=10, and xy=100.

But let's check the second equation: log_y(x^{4y})=log_10(10^{40})=40, but it's supposed to be 10. So that doesn't work either.

So, x and y can't be the same. So scratch that idea.

Hmm, maybe I can take the ratio of the two equations. Let me think.



---------------

Wait, from equation 1: x^10 = y^x.

From equation 2: y^10 =x^{4y}.

So, let's take the ratio of equation 1 to equation 2.

(x^10)/(y^10) = (y^x)/(x^{4y}).

Simplify left side: (x/y)^10.

Right side: y^x / x^{4y} = (y^x)/(x^{4y}) = (y/x)^{4y} * y^{x -4y}.



---------------

Wait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, express both sides with same base.

Wait, perhaps better to write both equations in terms of exponents.



---------------

Wait, from equation 1: x^10 = y^x.

From equation 2: y^10 =x^{4y}.

Let me write equation 1 as y = x^{10/x}.

Then substitute this into equation 2: (x^{10/x})^10 = x^{4y}.

Simplify left side: x^{100/x} =x^{4y}.

Since the bases are same and x>1, the exponents must be equal.

So, 100/x =4y.

But from earlier, we had xy=25, so y=25/x.

Substitute into 100/x =4*(25/x).

So, 100/x =100/x.

Which is an identity. Hmm, so that doesn't give any new information.

So, that suggests that as long as xy=25, these equations hold. 

---------------

But wait, that can't be because when I tried x=5, y=5, which gives xy=25, but it doesn't satisfy the original equations.

So, perhaps there are multiple solutions with xy=25, but only specific x and y satisfy both equations.



---------------

Wait, so maybe I need another equation to find x and y.

Wait, from earlier steps, we had:

From equation 1: ln y = (10 ln x)/x.

From equation 2: ln y = (2y ln x)/5.

Setting them equal, we get (10 ln x)/x = (2y ln x)/5.

Which led us to xy=25.

So, that's one equation, but we have two variables. So we need another equation.



---------------

But wait, in the process, we used both equations to get to that point. So perhaps the only condition is xy=25, but then when we plug back in, we might have to find the specific x and y.



---------------

Wait, perhaps we can write the equations in terms of each other.

From equation 1: x^10 = y^x.

From equation 2: y^10 =x^{4y}.

Let me take equation 1 and raise both sides to the power of y: (x^10)^y = (y^x)^y => x^{10y} = y^{xy}.

Similarly, from equation 2, take both sides to the power of x: (y^10)^x = (x^{4y})^x => y^{10x} = x^{4xy}.

Now, we have:

x^{10y} = y^{xy}  --> Equation 3.

y^{10x} = x^{4xy} --> Equation 4.

Hmm, perhaps we can take equation 3 and substitute into equation 4.



---------------

Wait, equation 3: x^{10y} = y^{xy}.

Take natural log: 10y ln x = xy ln y.

Divide both sides by y (since y>1, yâ‰ 0): 10 ln x =x ln y.



---------------

Wait, but that's exactly equation 1. So that's consistent.

Similarly, equation 4: y^{10x} =x^{4xy}.

Take natural log:10x ln y=4xy ln x.

Divide both sides by x:10 ln y =4y ln x.

Which is the same as equation 2. So, again, consistent.

So, perhaps we can't get more information this way.



---------------

Wait, maybe I can express equation 1 and equation 2 as ratios.

Equation 1: x^10 = y^x.

Equation 2: y^10 =x^{4y}.

Let me take equation 1 and raise both sides to the power of 10: (x^10)^10 = (y^x)^10 => x^{100}= y^{10x}.

But from equation 2, y^{10} =x^{4y}.

So, y^{10x} = (y^{10})^x = (x^{4y})^x =x^{4y x}.

So, from above, x^{100}=x^{4y x}.

Since x>1, the exponents must be equal: 100=4y x.

But from earlier, we have xy=25, so 4y x=4*25=100. So that's consistent.

So, that doesn't give new info.

Hmm, maybe I need to consider the earlier equation where I substituted y=25/x into equation 1 and got to x^{10 +x}=25^x.



---------------

Wait, let's write that again:

x^{10 +x}=25^x.

Take both sides to the power of 1/x:

x^{(10 +x)/x} =25.

Simplify the exponent:

x^{1 + 10/x}=25.

Let me write this as:

x * x^{10/x}=25.

Hmm, maybe take natural log of both sides:

ln(x) + (10/x) ln x = ln25.

Which is:

ln x (1 + 10/x )= ln25.

So,

ln x = ln25 / (1 + 10/x).

But from earlier, we had ln y = (10 ln x)/x, and y=25/x.



---------------

Wait, maybe this is going in circles.

Alternatively, let me let t = x^{1/x}.

Wait, because in the equation x^{1 + 10/x}=25, I can write it as x * (x^{1/x})^10=25.

So, x*(t)^10=25, where t= x^{1/x}.

Hmm, I don't know if that helps. Maybe take logs.



---------------

Wait, ln(x) +10*(ln x)/x = ln25.

Which is the same as:

ln x (1 +10/x )= ln25.

Hmm, not helpful yet.



---------------

Wait, let me write 1 +10/x as (x +10)/x.

So,

ln x * (x +10)/x = ln25.

So,

ln x = (ln25 *x )/(x +10).

Hmm, I can write this as:

ln x = [ln25 * x ] / (x +10).

Let me denote this as equation A.

Similarly, from equation 1, ln y = (10 ln x)/x.

But y=25/x, so ln y = ln(25) - ln x.

So,

ln(25) - ln x = (10 ln x)/x.

So,

ln25 = ln x + (10 ln x)/x.

Factor ln x:

ln25 = ln x (1 +10/x).

Which is the same as equation A.

So, no new info again.

Hmm, this seems tricky. Maybe I can make a substitution.

Let me let u = ln x.

Then, equation A becomes:

u = (ln25 * e^u )/(e^u +10).



---------------

Wait, because x = e^u, so 1/x = e^{-u}.

Wait, wait, actually, let me substitute x = e^u.

Then,

From equation A:

u = (ln25 * e^u )/(e^u +10).

Multiply both sides by (e^u +10):

u (e^u +10) = ln25 * e^u.

Bring all terms to left:

u e^u +10u - ln25 e^u =0.

Factor e^u:

e^u (u - ln25) +10u =0.

Hmm, not sure if that helps.



---------------

Alternatively, rearrange:

u (e^u +10) = e^u ln25.

Divide both sides by e^u:

u (1 +10 e^{-u}) = ln25.

Hmm, perhaps this can be expressed as:

u = ln25 / (1 +10 e^{-u}).

This looks like a transcendental equation, which might not have a closed-form solution. So, maybe I need to solve it numerically.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps we can make an intelligent guess for u.

Let me assume that u is a multiple of ln5, since 25 is 5^2.

Let me try u=2 ln5, which is ln25.

So, let me test u= ln25.

Left side: u = ln25.

Right side: ln25/(1 +10 e^{-ln25}).

Compute denominator: 1 +10 e^{-ln25} =1 +10*(1/25)=1 + 10/25=1 +0.4=1.4.

So right side: ln25 /1.4 â‰ˆ (3.2189)/1.4 â‰ˆ2.299.

But u= ln25â‰ˆ3.2189â‰ 2.299. So that doesn't work.



---------------

Wait, maybe u= ln5â‰ˆ1.609.

Compute right side: ln25/(1 +10 e^{-ln5}).

Compute e^{-ln5}=1/5=0.2.

So denominator=1+10*0.2=1+2=3.

So, right side= ln25 /3 â‰ˆ3.2189/3â‰ˆ1.073.

But u= ln5â‰ˆ1.609â‰ 1.073.

Hmm, not matching.



---------------

Alternatively, try u= ln10â‰ˆ2.3026.

Compute right side: ln25/(1 +10 e^{-ln10}).

e^{-ln10}=1/10=0.1.

Denominator=1+10*0.1=1+1=2.

Right side= ln25/2â‰ˆ3.2189/2â‰ˆ1.609.

But u= ln10â‰ˆ2.3026â‰ 1.609.

Hmm, not matching.



---------------

Wait, perhaps u= something else.

Wait, let me think. Maybe u= ln(25/ something). Not sure.



---------------

Alternatively, let me make a table of u and right side.

u | RHS= ln25/(1 +10 e^{-u})

Let me compute for u=2:

RHS= ln25/(1 +10 e^{-2})=3.2189/(1 +10*(0.1353))=3.2189/(1+1.353)=3.2189/2.353â‰ˆ1.368.

u=2: RHSâ‰ˆ1.368.

u=1.5:

RHS=3.2189/(1 +10 e^{-1.5})=3.2189/(1 +10*(0.2231))=3.2189/(1 +2.231)=3.2189/3.231â‰ˆ0.996.

u=1.5: RHSâ‰ˆ0.996.

u=1.7:

RHS=3.2189/(1 +10 e^{-1.7})=3.2189/(1 +10*(0.1827))=3.2189/(1 +1.827)=3.2189/2.827â‰ˆ1.138.



---------------

Wait, so when u=1.5, RHSâ‰ˆ0.996 <u.

When u=1.7, RHSâ‰ˆ1.138 <u.



---------------

Wait, but u is increasing from 1.5 to 1.7, RHS also increases but less than u.



---------------

Wait, maybe trying higher u.

u=2.5:

RHS=3.2189/(1 +10 e^{-2.5})=3.2189/(1 +10*(0.0821))=3.2189/(1+0.821)=3.2189/1.821â‰ˆ1.767.

Which is less than u=2.5.



---------------

Wait, but RHS is increasing as u increases, but not as fast as u.

Wait, perhaps the solution is when u= RHS.

So, when u=1.5, RHS=0.996 <1.5.

At u=1.7, RHS=1.138 <1.7.

At u=2, RHS=1.368 <2.



---------------

Wait, but at u=ln25â‰ˆ3.2189:

RHS= ln25/(1 +10 e^{-ln25})= ln25/(1 +10*(1/25))= ln25/(1 +0.4)= ln25/1.4â‰ˆ2.299.

Which is less than u=3.2189.



---------------

Wait, so perhaps the function f(u) = ln25/(1 +10 e^{-u}) is always less than u for u>0. So, does that mean that the equation u = f(u) has no solution?

But that can't be, because we have the problem statement that such x and y exist. So maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps.



---------------

Wait, let me retrace.

We have:

From equation 1: x^10 = y^x.

From equation 2: y^10 =x^{4y}.

We set ln y = (10 ln x)/x and ln y = (2y ln x)/5, leading to (10/x)=(2y)/5, so xy=25.

So, that's correct.

Then, substituting y=25/x into equation 1: x^10=(25/x)^x.

Which is x^{10 +x}=25^x.

So, x^{10 +x}=25^x.

Which is (x^{1 + 10/x})^x=25^x.

So, x^{1 +10/x}=25.

So, x^{1 +10/x}=25.

Hmm, perhaps I can take both sides to the power of something.



---------------

Alternatively, let me write x^{1 +10/x}=25.

Let me write 25 as 5^2.

So, x^{1 +10/x}=5^2.

Hmm, can I find x such that x is a power of 5? Let's say x=5^k.

Let me try x=5^k.

Then, equation becomes:

(5^k)^{1 +10/(5^k)}=5^2.

Which is 5^{k(1 +10/(5^k))}=5^2.

So, the exponents must be equal:

k(1 +10/(5^k))=2.

So, k + 10k/(5^k)=2.

Hmm, let's test k=1:

1 +10(1)/5=1 +2=3â‰ 2.

k=2:

2 +10*2/(25)=2 +20/25=2 +0.8=2.8â‰ 2.

k=0.5:

0.5 +10*(0.5)/sqrt(5)=0.5 +5/(2.236)â‰ˆ0.5 +2.236â‰ˆ2.736â‰ 2.

k=1. Let's see, we saw k=1 gives 3. What about k=0. Let's see, but x>1, so k>0.



---------------

Wait, perhaps k= something else.

Wait, let me rearrange:

k + (10k)/(5^k) =2.

Let me denote f(k)=k + (10k)/(5^k). We need f(k)=2.

Compute f(0.8):

k=0.8.

5^0.8â‰ˆ5^(4/5)= (5^{1/5})^4â‰ˆ(1.379)^4â‰ˆ3.568.

So, 10k/(5^k)=10*0.8/3.568â‰ˆ8/3.568â‰ˆ2.24.

So, f(0.8)=0.8 +2.24â‰ˆ3.04>2.

Hmm, need smaller f(k).

k=0.6:

5^0.6â‰ˆ5^(3/5)= (5^{1/5})^3â‰ˆ(1.379)^3â‰ˆ2.605.

10k/(5^k)=10*0.6/2.605â‰ˆ6/2.605â‰ˆ2.303.

f(k)=0.6 +2.303â‰ˆ2.903>2.

Still too high.

k=0.4:

5^0.4â‰ˆsqrt(5^0.8)=sqrt(3.568)=â‰ˆ1.889.

10k/(5^k)=10*0.4/1.889â‰ˆ4/1.889â‰ˆ2.113.

f(k)=0.4 +2.113â‰ˆ2.513>2.

Closer.

k=0.3:

5^0.3â‰ˆe^{0.3 ln5}â‰ˆe^{0.3*1.609}=e^{0.4827}â‰ˆ1.620.

10k/(5^k)=10*0.3/1.620â‰ˆ3/1.620â‰ˆ1.852.

f(k)=0.3 +1.852â‰ˆ2.152>2.

Almost there.

k=0.25:

5^0.25â‰ˆsqrt(sqrt(5))â‰ˆ1.495.

10k/(5^k)=10*0.25/1.495â‰ˆ2.5/1.495â‰ˆ1.671.

f(k)=0.25 +1.671â‰ˆ1.921<2.

So, f(k) crosses 2 between k=0.25 and k=0.3.

Let me try k=0.28:

5^0.28â‰ˆe^{0.28*1.609}=e^{0.4505}â‰ˆ1.568.

10k/(5^k)=10*0.28/1.568â‰ˆ2.8/1.568â‰ˆ1.786.

f(k)=0.28 +1.786â‰ˆ2.066>2.

k=0.27:

5^0.27â‰ˆe^{0.27*1.609}=e^{0.4344}â‰ˆ1.544.

10k/(5^k)=10*0.27/1.544â‰ˆ2.7/1.544â‰ˆ1.747.

f(k)=0.27 +1.747â‰ˆ2.017>2.

Close.

k=0.26:

5^0.26â‰ˆe^{0.26*1.609}=e^{0.418}â‰ˆ1.519.

10k/(5^k)=10*0.26/1.519â‰ˆ2.6/1.519â‰ˆ1.711.

f(k)=0.26 +1.711â‰ˆ1.971<2.

So, between k=0.26 and k=0.27.

Using linear approximation:

At k=0.26, f=1.971.

At k=0.27, f=2.017.

We need f(k)=2.

Difference between k=0.26 and 0.27 is 0.01, f increases by ~0.046.

We need to cover 2-1.971=0.029.

So, fraction=0.029 /0.046â‰ˆ0.63.

So, kâ‰ˆ0.26 +0.63*0.01â‰ˆ0.26+0.0063â‰ˆ0.2663.

So, kâ‰ˆ0.2663.

Thus, x=5^{0.2663}.

Compute 5^{0.2663}=e^{0.2663 * ln5}=e^{0.2663*1.6094}=e^{0.4284}â‰ˆ1.534.

So, xâ‰ˆ1.534.

Then, y=25/xâ‰ˆ25/1.534â‰ˆ16.30.



---------------

Wait, let me check if these approximate values satisfy the original equations.

First equation: log_x(y^x)=10.

Compute y^x:16.30^{1.534}.

Compute ln(16.30^{1.534})=1.534 ln16.30â‰ˆ1.534*2.793â‰ˆ4.294.

So, e^{4.294}=â‰ˆ74.1.

So, y^xâ‰ˆ74.1.

Then, log_x(74.1)= ln74.1 / ln x.

ln74.1â‰ˆ4.306, ln xâ‰ˆln1.534â‰ˆ0.428.

So, log_x(74.1)=4.306/0.428â‰ˆ10.06. Close to 10.

Second equation: log_y(x^{4y})=10.

Compute x^{4y}=1.534^{4*16.30}=1.534^{65.2}.

Hmm, that's a huge number. Let me compute ln(x^{4y})=65.2 ln1.534â‰ˆ65.2*0.428â‰ˆ28.0.

So, x^{4y}=e^{28}â‰ˆ4.36*10^12.

Then, log_y of that is ln(4.36e12)/ln y.

ln y=ln16.30â‰ˆ2.793.

ln(4.36e12)=ln4.36 +12 ln10â‰ˆ1.473 +12*2.302â‰ˆ1.473 +27.624â‰ˆ29.097.

So, log_y=29.097 /2.793â‰ˆ10.406.

Hmm, that's about 10.4, which is close to 10, but not exact. Perhaps the approximation is not precise enough.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe there's an exact solution where x and y are 5 and 5, but that didn't work earlier.



---------------

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe x and y are such that x=25/y, but that's same as xy=25.



---------------

Wait, but perhaps I can express the equations in terms of t=xy=25.

Wait, not sure.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I can use substitution.

Let me consider that equation 1: x^10 = y^x.

Take both sides to the power of 1/x: x^{10/x}=y.

Similarly, equation 2: y^10 =x^{4y}.

Take both sides to the power of 1/(4y): y^{10/(4y)}=x.

But since y= x^{10/x}, substitute into this:

y^{10/(4y)}=x.

So, (x^{10/x})^{10/(4y)}=x.

Simplify exponent: (10/x)*(10/(4y))=100/(4xy)=25/(xy).

But from earlier, xy=25, so this becomes 25/25=1.

So, (x^{10/x})^{1}=x.

So, x^{10/x}=x.

So, x^{10/x}=x.

Which implies that 10/x=1, because x^a =x implies a=1.

So, 10/x=1 => x=10.

Ah! So, x=10.

Then, since xy=25, y=25/10=2.5.

So, x=10, y=2.5.



---------------

Wait, let me check if these satisfy the original equations.

First equation: log_x(y^x)=log_10(2.5^{10}).

Compute 2.5^10.

2.5^2=6.25, 2.5^4=6.25^2=39.0625, 2.5^5=97.65625, 2.5^10=(2.5^5)^2â‰ˆ(97.65625)^2â‰ˆ9536.743.

So, log_10(9536.743)= log10(9.536743e3)=3 + log10(9.536743)â‰ˆ3 +0.979â‰ˆ3.979â‰ˆ4, which is not 10. So, that's not correct.

Hmm, that contradicts. So, perhaps I made a mistake in that step.



---------------

Wait, when I substituted y= x^{10/x} into equation 2, let me double-check.

Equation 2: y^10 =x^{4y}.

Substitute y= x^{10/x}:

(x^{10/x})^10 =x^{4y}.

So, x^{100/x}=x^{4y}.

Which implies that 100/x=4y.

But since xy=25, y=25/x.

So, 100/x=4*(25/x)=100/x.

Which is an identity. So, no new information.

So, x can be any value such that xy=25, but only specific x and y will satisfy both equations.



---------------

Wait, but earlier when I set x^{10/x}=x, I concluded x=10, but that didn't satisfy the original equation.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in that substitution.

Wait, when I substituted into equation 2, I had:

y^{10/(4y)}=x.

But y= x^{10/x}, so:

(x^{10/x})^{10/(4y)}=x.

Which is x^{(10/x)*(10/(4y))}=x.

So, the exponent is (100)/(4xy x).



---------------

Wait, no, let me compute the exponents correctly.

The exponent is (10/x) multiplied by (10/(4y)).

Which is (100)/(4x y).

But since xy=25, this is (100)/(4*25)=100/100=1.

So, the exponent is 1, so x^{1}=x.

Which is always true.

So, that doesn't give any new info.

Hmm, perhaps I need to accept that the equations reduce to xy=25, but with x and y satisfying x^{1 +10/x}=25.

Which is a transcendental equation and can't be solved exactly, but the problem says such numbers exist and asks for xy, which we have as 25.



---------------

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "there exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that..." So, perhaps the answer is 25, regardless of the specific x and y.



---------------

Wait, but earlier when I tried x=10, y=2.5, the logs didn't equal 10. So, that suggests that even though xy=25, the specific x and y must satisfy the equations, so xy=25 is the answer.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the answer is 25, as per the problem's instruction, but the initial step led us to xy=25, regardless of the specific x and y.

But the problem asks for xy, so maybe the answer is 25, and the specific x and y are not necessary.



---------------

Wait, but I thought the problem was more complex, but perhaps not. Let me read the problem again.

It says "there exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log_x(y^x)=10 and log_y(x^{4y})=10. Find xy."

So, from the given, we found that xy=25. So, maybe the answer is 25.

But earlier, when I tried x=10 and y=2.5, it didn't satisfy the first equation.



---------------

Wait, let me compute log_x(y^x) when x=10, y=2.5.

log_10(2.5^10)= log_10(9536.743)= approximately 3.979, which is not 10.

So, that's a problem.



---------------

Wait, but according to our earlier steps, we have:

From equation 1: x^{10}= y^x.

From equation 2: y^{10}=x^{4y}.

And from these, we derived that xy=25.

But when I assumed x=10, y=2.5, it didn't satisfy equation 1.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that x^{10/x}=x.



---------------

Wait, that was a wrong assumption because when I substituted y= x^{10/x} into equation 2, I ended up with an identity, which only tells me that the substitution is valid, but doesn't give new info.

So, perhaps the only condition is that xy=25, but to find specific x and y, we need to solve the transcendental equation, which we can't do algebraically.

But the problem only asks for xy, which we found as 25.

So, perhaps the answer is 25.


Given the problem, we need to find real numbers \( x \) and \( y \), both greater than 1, such that:
\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.
\]
We are to determine the product \( xy \).

### Step 1: Convert Logarithmic Equations to Exponential Form
Using the property \( \log_b(a) = c \iff b^c = a \), we rewrite the given equations:
1. \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) implies \( x^{10} = y^x \).
2. \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \) implies \( y^{10} = x^{4y} \).

### Step 2: Relate \( x \) and \( y \)
From the first equation, take the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[
10 \ln x = x \ln y \quad \Rightarrow \quad \ln y = \frac{10 \ln x}{x}.
\]
From the second equation, take the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[
10 \ln y = 4y \ln x \quad \Rightarrow \quad \ln y = \frac{2y \ln x}{5}.
\]
Set the two expressions for \( \ln y \) equal:
\[
\frac{10 \ln x}{x} = \frac{2y \ln x}{5}.
\]
Cancel \( \ln x \) (since \( x > 1 \), \( \ln x \neq 0 \)):
\[
\frac{10}{x} = \frac{2y}{5}.
\]
Multiply both sides by \( 5x \):
\[
50 = 2xy.
\]
Divide by 2:
\[
xy = 25.
\]

### Conclusion
The product \( xy \) is \( \boxed{25} \).
