Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the value of OC² where C is a specific point on segment AB. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the points given are O(0,0), A(1/2, 0), and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway to (1,0), and B is on the y-axis somewhere above (0,1) but a bit closer because sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. 

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant. P is on the x-axis, and Q is on the y-axis. So, each PQ is a line segment from some point (p,0) to (0,q), with p and q positive, and the distance between P and Q is 1. So, the length of PQ is 1.

I remember that the distance between two points (p,0) and (0,q) is sqrt(p² + q²). So, for PQ to be of unit length, we have sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, which means p² + q² = 1.

So, all these segments PQ lie in the first quadrant, connecting the x-axis to the y-axis, each of length 1. So, the family F is all such segments.

Now, the problem says there's a unique point C on AB, other than A and B, that isn't on any other segment from F except AB. So, point C is on AB, but it's not on any other PQ in F. So, it's only on AB and no other such segment.

We need to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then express it as p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.

Alright, let me visualize this. Points O, A, B form a triangle? 

---------------

Wait, O is (0,0), A is (1/2,0), and B is (0,sqrt(3)/2). So, if I connect these points, O to A is along the x-axis, O to B is along the y-axis, and A to B is a line segment.



---------------

Wait, connecting A(1/2,0) to B(0,sqrt(3)/2), that's a straight line. So, AB is a straight line in the first quadrant, from (1/2,0) to (0,sqrt(3)/2).

So, AB is part of a line. I can write the equation of line AB.

Let me find the equation of AB. The slope would be (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the slope is -sqrt(3). Since it passes through point A (1/2,0), the equation is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, any point C on AB can be parametrized as (x, y) where y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. 

---------------

Alternatively, I can parameterize it using a parameter t, where t ranges from 0 to 1. Let me think.

Let me define point C as moving from A to B. So, when t=0, C is at A (1/2, 0), and when t=1, C is at B (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the parametric equations would be x = 1/2 - (1/2)t, y = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)t. So, x = (1 - t)/2, y = (sqrt(3)/2)t.

So, C can be represented as ((1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3)/2)t) for t between 0 and 1.

Now, the key is that point C is on AB and not on any other PQ from family F except AB. So, for any other segment PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

So, for C not to lie on any other PQ in F, except AB, that means that for all other PQ segments in F, the point C does not lie on PQ.

But AB is one such PQ segment in F? 

---------------

Wait, is AB in F?

Wait, AB is a segment from A(1/2,0) to B(0,sqrt(3)/2). Let's check if AB is in F.

F consists of segments PQ of unit length, with P on x-axis and Q on y-axis. The length of AB is the distance between A and B, which is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So, yes, AB is a segment of length 1, so AB is in F.

Therefore, point C is on AB, which is in F, but it's not on any other segment in F. So, for all other PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

So, the point C is the only point on AB (other than A and B) that isn't on any other PQ in F.

Therefore, C must be such that it's the intersection point of AB and another PQ in F, but for some reason, it can't be on any other PQ except AB. Hmm, maybe C is the point where AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F.



---------------

Wait, I think the family F forms an envelope, and the envelope is a curve that is tangent to all the segments PQ in F. So, maybe point C is where AB is tangent to this envelope. Therefore, C would be the point of tangency, and hence, it's the only point on AB that lies on such a tangent, hence not lying on any other PQ except AB.

So, perhaps I need to find the envelope of the family F.

Let me recall that the envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. In this case, the family is all line segments PQ of length 1 from the x-axis to y-axis. So, each PQ is a straight line segment between (p,0) and (0,q), with p² + q² =1.

So, parametric equations for PQ can be written as x/p + y/q =1, with p² + q² =1.

So, the family of lines is x/p + y/q =1, where p² + q² =1.

To find the envelope, we can use the method of solving for the envelope. The envelope satisfies both the equation of the family and the derivative with respect to the parameter.

So, in this case, let me let the parameter be, say, p. Then q is determined by p since p² + q² =1 => q = sqrt(1 - p²). But since we are in the first quadrant, q is positive.

So, the equation of the line PQ is x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) =1.

To find the envelope, we can treat this as a function F(p, x, y) = x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) -1 =0.

Then, the envelope must satisfy F(p, x, y)=0 and dF/dp =0.

So, compute dF/dp.

dF/dp = -x/p² + y*( (1/2)(-2p)/( (1 - p²)^(3/2) )) = -x/p² - y*p/( (1 - p²)^(3/2) )

Set dF/dp =0:

-x/p² - y*p/( (1 - p²)^(3/2) ) =0.

So, we have two equations:

1. x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) =1.

2. -x/p² - y*p/( (1 - p²)^(3/2) ) =0.

Let me try to solve these equations for x and y in terms of p.

From equation 2:

-x/p² = y*p/( (1 - p²)^(3/2) )

So, x = - y*p^3 / ( (1 - p²)^(3/2) )

But from equation 1:

x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) =1.

Substitute x from equation 2 into equation 1.

So, [ (- y*p^3 / ( (1 - p²)^(3/2) )) ] / p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) =1.

Simplify the first term:

(- y*p^2 ) / ( (1 - p²)^(3/2) ) + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) =1.

Factor out y/(sqrt(1 - p²)):

y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) [ -p²/(1 - p²) + 1 ] =1.

Simplify inside the brackets:

- p²/(1 - p²) + 1 = (-p² + (1 - p²)) / (1 - p²) ) = ( -2p² +1 ) / (1 - p² )

So, the equation becomes:

y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) * ( (1 - 2p²) / (1 - p²) ) ) =1.

Multiply the terms:

y * (1 - 2p²) / ( (1 - p²)^(3/2) ) ) =1.

So, y = (1 - p²)^(3/2) / (1 - 2p²).

Similarly, from equation 2, x = - y*p^3 / ( (1 - p²)^(3/2) )

Substituting y into this:

x = [ (1 - p²)^(3/2) / (1 - 2p²) ) ] * ( - p^3 / (1 - p²)^(3/2) )

Simplify:

x = - p^3 / (1 - 2p² )

So, now we have expressions for x and y in terms of p.

So, parametric equations for the envelope are:

x = - p^3 / (1 - 2p² )

y = (1 - p²)^(3/2) / (1 - 2p² )

But we need to consider the range of p. Since p² + q² =1, p is in (0,1). Also, in the denominator, 1 - 2p² cannot be zero, so p² ≠ 1/2, so p ≠ sqrt(1/2) ≈0.707.

But looking at the parametric equations, when p approaches sqrt(1/2), the denominator approaches zero, so x and y go to infinity or negative infinity. But since we're in the first quadrant, p must be such that x and y are positive.

So, for x to be positive, since numerator is -p^3 (negative), denominator must be negative. So, denominator 1 - 2p² <0 => 2p² >1 => p² >1/2 => p>sqrt(1/2). But p is in (0,1). So, p must be in (sqrt(1/2),1).

But if p is greater than sqrt(1/2), then y would be (1 - p²)^(3/2) / (1 - 2p²). Let's check the sign. 1 - p² is negative because p>sqrt(1/2), so (1 - p²)^(3/2) is imaginary. 

---------------

Wait, that's a problem.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, in the parametric equations, x is given as -p^3/(1 - 2p²). For p > sqrt(1/2), denominator is negative, so x is positive because numerator is negative divided by negative.

Similarly, y is (1 - p²)^(3/2)/(1 - 2p²). Since 1 - p² is negative for p > sqrt(1/2), (1 - p²)^(3/2) is imaginary. 

---------------

Wait, that can't be. So, perhaps I missed a square somewhere.

Wait, the original equation is x/p + y/q =1, where q = sqrt(1 - p²). So, when p > sqrt(1/2), q is imaginary? No, because p² + q² =1, so q is real as long as p is real and |p| <=1.



---------------

Wait, but when p > sqrt(1/2), 1 - p² is negative, so q = sqrt(1 - p²) is imaginary. So, that can't be.



---------------

Wait a minute, that suggests that p cannot be greater than sqrt(1/2), because then q becomes imaginary, which isn't allowed because q must be a real number on the y-axis. So, p must be in [0,1], but q must also be real. So, perhaps the parametric equations only make sense for p in [0,1/sqrt(2)]?



---------------

Wait, because when p is in [0,1/sqrt(2)], then q is sqrt(1 - p²) >= sqrt(1 - 1/2) = sqrt(1/2) >0.



---------------

Wait, but when p is in [1/sqrt(2),1], q would be imaginary. So, perhaps the family F only considers p in [0,1/sqrt(2)], because beyond that, q becomes imaginary, which isn't in the first quadrant.

So, perhaps p is in (0,1/sqrt(2)), so that q is positive real.

So, in that case, for p in (0,1/sqrt(2)), q is positive, and the line PQ is in the first quadrant.

So, going back, for p in (0,1/sqrt(2)), our parametric equations for the envelope would be:

x = - p^3 / (1 - 2p² )

But if p is in (0,1/sqrt(2)), then denominator 1 - 2p² is positive because 2p² <1.

So, denominator is positive, numerator is -p^3, so x would be negative. But we need x to be positive because we're in the first quadrant.

So, this suggests that our parametric equations give x negative, which is not acceptable.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when solving for x.



---------------

Wait, let's go back to equation 2:

From equation 2: -x/p² - y*p/( (1 - p²)^(3/2) ) =0.

So, -x/p² = y*p/( (1 - p²)^(3/2) )

Multiply both sides by -1:

x/p² = - y*p/( (1 - p²)^(3/2) )

So, x = - y*p^3 / ( (1 - p²)^(3/2) )

So, x is negative if y is positive because numerator is - y*p^3, which is negative, and denominator is positive since (1 - p²) is positive for p <1/sqrt(2).

So, x is negative, which is not in the first quadrant. Hmm, that's a problem.



---------------

Wait, maybe I should have considered the absolute value when taking square roots, but I don't think that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have taken the parameter as q instead of p. Let me try that.

Let me consider the parameter as q, so p = sqrt(1 - q²). Then, the equation of PQ is x/p + y/q =1 => x/sqrt(1 - q²) + y/q =1.

Then, to find the envelope, compute derivative with respect to q and set it to zero.

So, F(q, x, y) = x/sqrt(1 - q²) + y/q -1 =0.

Compute dF/dq:

dF/dq = x*( (1/2)(1 - q²)^(-3/2)*(2q) ) + (- y / q² )

Simplify:

= x*q/( (1 - q²)^(3/2) ) - y/q² =0.

So, equation 2 is x*q/( (1 - q²)^(3/2) ) - y/q² =0.

So, from equation 1: x/sqrt(1 - q²) + y/q =1.

From equation 2: x*q/( (1 - q²)^(3/2) ) = y/q².

Let me solve for x from equation 1:

x/sqrt(1 - q²) =1 - y/q => x = sqrt(1 - q²)*(1 - y/q )

Plug into equation 2:

[ sqrt(1 - q²)*(1 - y/q ) ] * q/( (1 - q²)^(3/2) ) = y/q².

Simplify:

sqrt(1 - q²) * q * (1 - y/q ) / (1 - q²)^(3/2) ) = y/q².

Simplify the left side:

q * (1 - y/q ) / (1 - q²) )

So,

q*(1 - y/q) / (1 - q²) = y/q².

Multiply both sides by (1 - q²):

q*(1 - y/q ) = y*(1 - q²)/q².

Simplify left side:

q - y = y*(1 - q²)/q².

Multiply both sides by q²:

q³ - y q² = y (1 - q²).

Bring all terms to left:

q³ - y q² - y + y q² =0.

Simplify:

q³ - y =0 => y = q³.

So, from this, y = q³.

Now, substitute back into equation 1:

x/sqrt(1 - q²) + q³/q =1 => x/sqrt(1 - q²) + q² =1.

So, x/sqrt(1 - q²) =1 - q² => x = (1 - q²)^(3/2).

So, the parametric equations for the envelope are:

x = (1 - q²)^(3/2 )

y = q³

But since q is a parameter, let's express q in terms of x and y.



---------------

Wait, perhaps it's better to write in terms of a parameter t, but maybe not necessary.

Alternatively, we can write this as:

Let me express x and y in terms of q.

x = (1 - q²)^(3/2 )

y = q³.

We can try to eliminate q to find the relation between x and y.

Let me take q = y^(1/3).

Then, x = (1 - y^(2/3))^(3/2 )

Hmm, not sure if that helps.



---------------

Alternatively, let me square both sides:

x² = (1 - q²)^3.

But y = q³, so q = y^(1/3).

So, x² = (1 - (y^(1/3))² )^3 = (1 - y^(2/3))^3.

So, x² = (1 - y^(2/3))^3.

But that's a bit complicated. 

---------------

Alternatively, maybe express it as x = (1 - q²)^(3/2), y = q³.

I think that's the envelope curve.

But now, how does this help us? We need to find point C on AB such that C is only on AB and no other PQ in F. So, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to this envelope.

So, the envelope is the curve x = (1 - q²)^(3/2 ), y = q³.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to parametrize the envelope in terms of p, but earlier we had x negative, which isn't in the first quadrant. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization.



---------------

Wait, maybe the envelope lies entirely in the first quadrant, so perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when solving for x. Let me double-check.



---------------

Wait, when I solved equation 2, I had:

From equation 2: x*q/( (1 - q²)^(3/2) ) = y/q².

So, x = [ y/q² ] * [ (1 - q²)^(3/2) / q ]

Which is x = y*(1 - q²)^(3/2) / q^3.

But since y = q³, then x = q³ * (1 - q²)^(3/2) / q^3 = (1 - q²)^(3/2 ).

So, that's consistent.

So, x = (1 - q²)^(3/2 ), y = q³.

So, the parametric equations are correct.

So, the envelope is given by x = (1 - q²)^(3/2 ), y = q³.

Now, we need to find where the line AB is tangent to this envelope.

Because point C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope, so it's the only point on AB that lies on the envelope, hence not lying on any other PQ in F.

So, we need to find the point of tangency between AB and the envelope.

Equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, to find the point C where AB is tangent to the envelope, we can set y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 and the parametric equations of the envelope.

So, substitute y = q³ and x = (1 - q²)^(3/2 ) into the equation of AB.

So,

q³ = -sqrt(3)*(1 - q²)^(3/2 ) + sqrt(3)/2.

Let me rearrange:

q³ + sqrt(3)*(1 - q²)^(3/2 ) = sqrt(3)/2.

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but perhaps we can solve for q numerically or find a substitution.

Let me denote t = q², so q = sqrt(t), and 1 - q² =1 - t.

So, substituting:

(sqrt(t))³ + sqrt(3)*(1 - t)^(3/2 ) = sqrt(3)/2.

Simplify:

t^(3/2) + sqrt(3)*(1 - t)^(3/2 ) = sqrt(3)/2.

Let me divide both sides by sqrt(3):

( t^(3/2) ) / sqrt(3) + (1 - t)^(3/2 ) = 1/2.

Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe try a substitution.

Let me denote u = t^(1/2), so t = u², and 1 - t =1 - u².

So, t^(3/2) = u^3, and (1 - t)^(3/2 ) = (1 - u²)^(3/2).

So, substituting:

u³ / sqrt(3) + (1 - u²)^(3/2 ) = 1/2.

This still looks complicated, but perhaps I can guess a value for u.

Let me try u = 1/2.

So, u =1/2:

u³ / sqrt(3) = (1/8)/sqrt(3) ≈ 0.204.

(1 - u²)^(3/2 ) = (1 - 1/4)^(3/2 ) = (3/4)^(3/2 ) = (sqrt(3)/2)^3 ≈ (0.866)^3 ≈ 0.6495.

Adding together: approx 0.204 + 0.6495 ≈ 0.8535, which is greater than 1/2.

Hmm, too big. Let me try u= sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.



---------------

Wait, u can't be larger than 1 because t = u², and t is q², which is less than 1.



---------------

Wait, let me try u=1/√3 ≈0.577.

u=1/√3:

u³ / sqrt(3) = (1/(3√3))/sqrt(3) )= (1/(3*3)) )=1/9 ≈0.111.

(1 - u² )=1 -1/3=2/3, so (2/3)^(3/2 )= (2√2)/(3√3) )= approx (2.828)/(5.196)≈0.544.

Adding: 0.111 + 0.544≈0.655>0.5.

Still too big.



---------------

Wait, trying u=1/√2≈0.707.

u=1/√2:

u³ / sqrt(3)= (1/(2√2))/sqrt(3)≈(0.3535)/1.732≈0.204.

(1 - u² )=1 -1/2=1/2, so (1/2)^(3/2 )= (sqrt(1/8))≈0.3535.

Sum≈0.204 +0.3535≈0.5575>0.5.

Still too big.

Let me try u=0.6.

u=0.6:

u³=0.216, so 0.216 /1.732≈0.1247.

(1 -0.36)=0.64, so (0.64)^(3/2 )=0.64*sqrt(0.64)=0.64*0.8=0.512.

Sum≈0.1247 +0.512≈0.6367>0.5.

Still too big.

Hmm, perhaps u=0.55.

u=0.55:

u³≈0.55^3=0.166.

0.166 /1.732≈0.0958.

(1 -0.3025)=0.6975.

(0.6975)^(3/2 )=sqrt(0.6975^3).

Calculate 0.6975^3≈0.6975*0.6975=0.4865, then *0.6975≈0.339.

sqrt(0.339 )≈0.582.



---------------

Wait, no, wait: (0.6975)^(3/2 )=sqrt(0.6975^3).



---------------

Wait, 0.6975^3≈0.339, so sqrt(0.339 )≈0.582.



---------------

Wait, no, wait: no, (a)^(3/2 )=a*sqrt(a).

So, 0.6975 * sqrt(0.6975 )≈0.6975 *0.835≈0.582.

So, sum≈0.0958 +0.582≈0.6778>0.5.

Hmm, still too big.



---------------

Wait, maybe u=0.4.

u=0.4:

u³=0.064.

0.064 /1.732≈0.037.

(1 -0.16)=0.84.

(0.84)^(3/2 )=sqrt(0.84^3).

0.84^3≈0.5927, sqrt≈0.77.

So, sum≈0.037 +0.77≈0.807>0.5.

Too big.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I should try a larger u? Wait, but as u increases, the first term increases, but the second term decreases.



---------------

Wait, at u=0, the sum is 0 +1=1>0.5.

At u approaching 1, the first term approaches1/sqrt(3)≈0.577, and the second term approaches0. So, the sum approaches ~0.577>0.5.

So, the function is decreasing as u increases from 0 to1, but it's always above 0.5. So, maybe there's no solution? That can't be, because we know there is a point C.



---------------

Wait, perhaps my approach is wrong. Alternatively, maybe I should parametrize the envelope differently.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that the envelope is the astroid.



---------------

Wait, the family of lines x/p + y/q =1, with p² + q²=1, is known to form an astroid as the envelope. So, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.



---------------

Wait, is that correct?

Let me check: the astroid is given by x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = a^(2/3), but in our case, it's x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.



---------------

Wait, let's verify:

If x = (1 - q²)^(3/2 ), y= q³.

Then, x^(2/3) = (1 - q²)^( (3/2)*(2/3) )=1 - q².

y^(2/3)= (q³)^(2/3 )= q².

So, x^(2/3 ) + y^(2/3 )=1 - q² + q²=1.

So, yes, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3 ) + y^(2/3 )=1.

So, that's a much simpler way to represent the envelope.

Therefore, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.

So, now, the point C is the point where line AB is tangent to this astroid.

So, we need to find the point of tangency between AB and the astroid.

So, line AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

We need to find the point (x,y) on the astroid that lies on AB and is a point of tangency.

So, substituting y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 into the astroid equation x^(2/3 ) + y^(2/3 )=1.

So, x^(2/3 ) + ( -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 )^(2/3 ) =1.

This seems complicated, but perhaps we can solve for x.

Let me denote t = x^(1/3), so x = t³.

Similarly, let me write y in terms of t.

But maybe it's better to let s = x^(2/3 ), so x = s^(3/2 ).



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps a substitution.

Wait, maybe express everything in terms of x.

So, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, substitute into the astroid equation:

x^(2/3 ) + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3 ) =1.

Let me factor sqrt(3) from the bracket:

[ sqrt(3)( -x + 1/2 ) ]^(2/3 ) = [ sqrt(3) ]^(2/3 ) * ( -x +1/2 )^(2/3 ) = (3^(1/2))^(2/3) * ( -x +1/2 )^(2/3 ) = 3^(1/3 ) * (1/2 -x )^(2/3 )

So, the equation becomes:

x^(2/3 ) + 3^(1/3 )*(1/2 -x )^(2/3 ) =1.

Let me denote u =x^(1/3 ), so x= u³.

Similarly, (1/2 -x )=1/2 - u³.

So, x^(2/3 )= u².

And (1/2 -x )^(2/3 )= (1/2 -u³ )^(2/3 ).

So, the equation becomes:

u² + 3^(1/3 )*(1/2 -u³ )^(2/3 ) =1.

This still looks complicated, but maybe I can make a substitution for v= u³.

Let me let v= u³, so u= v^(1/3 ), u²= v^(2/3 ).

Then, the equation becomes:

v^(2/3 ) + 3^(1/3 )*(1/2 -v )^(2/3 ) =1.

Hmm, still not helpful.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps let’s let z = (1/2 -x )^(1/3 ), so (1/2 -x )= z³.

Then, x=1/2 - z³.

So, substituting into the equation:

x^(2/3 ) + 3^(1/3 ) z² =1.

But x=1/2 - z³, so:

(1/2 - z³ )^(2/3 ) + 3^(1/3 ) z² =1.

Not sure if that helps.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe I can set both terms equal to something.

Alternatively, perhaps using calculus. Since the point C is on both the astroid and the line AB, and it's a point of tangency, their derivatives at that point should be equal.

So, compute the derivative of the astroid and the slope of AB, set them equal.

Equation of astroid: x^(2/3 ) + y^(2/3 )=1.

Differentiate implicitly:

(2/3)x^(-1/3 ) + (2/3)y^(-1/3 ) dy/dx =0.

So, dy/dx= - [ x^(-1/3 ) ] / [ y^(-1/3 ) ] = - (y^(1/3 )) / (x^(1/3 )).

So, the slope of the astroid at point (x,y) is m= - (y^(1/3 )) / (x^(1/3 )).

But the slope of AB is -sqrt(3).

So, setting them equal:

- (y^(1/3 )) / (x^(1/3 )) = -sqrt(3).

Simplify:

(y^(1/3 )) / (x^(1/3 )) = sqrt(3).

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

y / x = (sqrt(3))^3 = 3*sqrt(3).

So, y = 3*sqrt(3) x.

But we also have y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, set 3*sqrt(3) x = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Divide both sides by sqrt(3):

3x = -x + 1/2.

Bring terms together:

3x +x =1/2 =>4x=1/2 =>x=1/8.

So, x=1/8.

Then, y=3*sqrt(3)*(1/8 )= (3 sqrt(3))/8.



---------------

Wait, but from AB's equation, y= -sqrt(3)*(1/8 ) + sqrt(3)/2= (-sqrt(3)/8 ) + (4 sqrt(3)/8 )= (3 sqrt(3))/8. So, consistent.

So, the point C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 ).

Now, we can compute OC².

OC²= (1/8 )² + (3 sqrt(3)/8 )² =1/64 + (27)/64=28/64=7/16.



---------------

Wait, 1² is 1, 3² is 9, (sqrt(3))² is 3, so 9*3=27.

So, 1 +27=28, over 64. Simplify: 28/64=7/16.

So, OC²=7/16.

Therefore, p=7, q=16, which are coprime. So, p+q=23.

So, the answer is 23.


To solve the problem, we need to find the point \( C \) on segment \( \overline{AB} \) that does not lie on any other segment from the family \( \mathcal{F} \) except \( \overline{AB} \). The family \( \mathcal{F} \) consists of unit-length segments \( \overline{PQ} \) with \( P \) on the \( x \)-axis and \( Q \) on the \( y \)-axis. 

The line \( \overline{AB} \) has the equation \( y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). The envelope of the family \( \mathcal{F} \) forms an astroid given by \( x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = 1 \). The point \( C \) is where the line \( \overline{AB} \) is tangent to this astroid.

To find \( C \), we set the slope of the astroid equal to the slope of \( \overline{AB} \) at the point of tangency. This gives the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = 1
\end{cases}
\]
Solving this system, we find \( x = \frac{1}{8} \) and \( y = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} \). 

The distance \( OC \) is calculated as:
\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{64} + \frac{27}{64} = \frac{28}{64} = \frac{7}{16}
\]
Thus, \( OC^2 = \frac{7}{16} \), and the sum \( p + q \) where \( \frac{p}{q} = \frac{7}{16} \) is \( 7 + 16 = 23 \).

\boxed{23}
