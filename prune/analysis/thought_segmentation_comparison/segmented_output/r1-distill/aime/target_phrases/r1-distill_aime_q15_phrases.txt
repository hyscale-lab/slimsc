Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what it's asking.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Alright, so first, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some positive integer n. Once I find that p, I have to find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Let me break this down. I think the first part is about finding primes p where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² has a solution. Since p is prime, I can maybe use some number theory here.

I remember that for primes p, the equation x² ≡ -1 mod p has a solution if and only if p ≡ 1 mod 4. But this is for squares. Here we're dealing with fourth powers. Hmm, so maybe the condition is similar but a bit different?



---------------

Wait, if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p², then (n²)² ≡ -1 mod p². So, that would mean that -1 is a quadratic residue modulo p². But when does -1 become a quadratic residue mod p²?

I think that if -1 is a quadratic residue mod p, then it's also a quadratic residue mod p². 

---------------

But wait, for primes p ≡ 1 mod 4, -1 is a quadratic residue mod p. So, for p ≡ 1 mod 4, does that mean that x² ≡ -1 mod p² has a solution?



---------------

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. For p=5, which is 1 mod 4, does x² ≡ -1 mod 25 have a solution?

Let me check. So, 2²=4≡4 mod25, 3²=9, 4²=16, 7²=49≡24, 8²=64≡14, 13²=169≡19, 18²=324≡24, 23²=529≡4. Hmm, I don't see any squares that are 24 mod25. 

---------------

Wait, but 24 is equivalent to -1 mod25.

Wait, let's compute 7²=49≡24 mod25, so yes, 7²≡-1 mod25. So, for p=5, which is 1 mod4, x²≡-1 mod25 has a solution. So, p=5 is a candidate.



---------------

But wait, the problem is about n⁴≡-1 mod p². So, n⁴≡-1 mod p². So, for p=5, does there exist an n such that n⁴≡-1 mod25?

Well, let's see. Let me compute n⁴ mod25 for some small n.

n=1: 1⁴=1 mod25
n=2: 16 mod25
n=3: 81 mod25 is 6
n=4: 256 mod25 is 6
n=5: 0 mod25
n=6: 6⁴=1296 mod25: 1296/25=51*25=1275, 1296-1275=21, so 21 mod25
n=7: 7⁴=2401 mod25: 2401 - 96*25=2401-2400=1
n=8: 8⁴=4096 mod25: 4096 - 163*25=4096-4075=21
n=9: 9⁴=6561 mod25: 6561 - 262*25=6561-6550=11
n=10: 0 mod25
n=11: 11⁴=14641 mod25: 14641 - 585*25=14641-14625=16
n=12: 12⁴=20736 mod25: 20736 - 829*25=20736-20725=11
n=13: 13⁴=28561 mod25: 28561 - 1142*25=28561-28550=11


---------------

Wait, n=7: 7⁴=2401, which is 1 mod25. So, 7⁴≡1 mod25, which isn't -1.



---------------

Wait, but earlier I saw that 7²≡-1 mod25, so (7²)²=7⁴≡1 mod25. So, that's consistent. So, maybe for p=5, n⁴≡-1 mod25 has no solution? Because n⁴ can be 1, 16, 6, 21, etc., but not -1.



---------------

Wait, so maybe p=5 is not suitable. Hmm, so perhaps the next prime that's 1 mod4 is p=13. Let me check p=13.



---------------

Wait, before that, let's think about whether n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² is possible. So, if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p², then n² must satisfy n² ≡ sqrt(-1) mod p². But maybe that's a bit vague.



---------------

Alternatively, I remember that for primes p, the multiplicative group mod p² is cyclic if p is odd. So, the multiplicative group mod p² has order p(p-1). So, for n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² to have a solution, -1 must be in the subgroup generated by n².



---------------

Wait, but n⁴ = (n²)^2, so if (n²)^2 ≡ -1 mod p², then the order of n² would have to divide 8, because (n²)^4 ≡ 1 mod p². So, the multiplicative order of n² would be 8, which would mean that 8 divides the order of the multiplicative group, which is p(p-1). So, 8 must divide p(p-1).

Since p is prime, either p=2 or p is odd. Let's check p=2 first.



---------------

Wait, p=2: Let's see if there's an n where n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4. So, n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod4. Let's compute n⁴ mod4.

n even: n=2k: n⁴=16k⁴≡0 mod4. So, 0+1=1≡1 mod4≠0.

n odd: n=2k+1: n⁴=(2k+1)^4. Let's compute mod4.

(2k+1)^2=4k²+4k+1≡1 mod4.

(2k+1)^4=(1)^2=1 mod4. So, 1+1=2≡2 mod4≠0.

So, for p=2, n⁴ +1 can never be divisible by 4. So, p=2 is out.

So, p must be an odd prime. So, p is an odd prime where 8 divides p(p-1). Since p is odd, p-1 must be even. So, for 8 to divide p(p-1), since p is odd, p must be ≡1 mod8, because p-1 must be divisible by 8, so p≡1 mod8.



---------------

Wait, let me check: if p is an odd prime, then p is 1 mod2. So, p-1 is even, so 2 divides p-1. To have 8 divide p(p-1), since p is odd, 8 must divide p-1. So, p ≡1 mod8.

So, the primes p≡1 mod8 are 17, 97, etc., but wait, wait, let me check the primes. The primes that are 1 mod8 are 17, 41, 73, 89, 97, etc. 

---------------

But wait, 5 is 5 mod8, 13 is 5 mod8. Wait, so maybe I'm wrong.



---------------

Wait, let me think again. If p is an odd prime, and 8 divides p(p-1), then since p is odd, p is coprime to 8. So, 8 must divide p-1. Therefore, p ≡1 mod8.

So, the smallest primes that are 1 mod8 are 17, 97, etc. 

---------------

But wait, wait, wait, 17 is the first prime after 2 that's 1 mod8. 

---------------

Wait, 17 is 1 mod8, 17=8*2 +1. 97 is next.



---------------

Wait, but wait, 5 is 5 mod8, which is 5, and 13 is 5 mod8 as well. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier, maybe p can be 5 mod8.



---------------

Wait, no, because if p is 5 mod8, then p-1 is 4 mod8, which is only divisible by 4, not 8. So, 8 doesn't divide p(p-1) in that case. So, p must be 1 mod8.

So, the smallest such primes are 17, 97, etc. So, p=17 is the smallest prime where 8 divides p(p-1). So, p=17 is a candidate.



---------------

But wait, wait, let me check p=5 again. Earlier, I thought that maybe p=5 might work, but when I checked n⁴ mod25, I didn't find any n where n⁴≡-1 mod25.



---------------

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in checking. Let me try n=7 again. n=7: 7²=49≡-1 mod25, so 7⁴=(7²)^2=(-1)^2=1 mod25. So, 7⁴≡1 mod25, which isn't -1. So, no solution for n⁴≡-1 mod25.



---------------

Wait, but maybe there's another n. Let me try n= 3: 3⁴=81≡6 mod25. n=2: 2⁴=16 mod25. n=1:1 mod25. n=4: 256 mod25 is 6. n=6: 6⁴=1296 mod25=21. n=8: 4096 mod25=21. n=9: 6561 mod25=11. n=11: 14641 mod25=16. n=12: 20736 mod25=11. n=13: 28561 mod25=11. Hmm, I don't see any n where n⁴≡-1 mod25. So, p=5 doesn't work.

So, maybe the next prime is p=17.

So, let me check if n⁴≡-1 mod17²=289 has a solution.



---------------

Wait, 17 is 1 mod8, so maybe there's a solution here.

Alternatively, maybe p=5 is not suitable, and the next possible prime is p=17.



---------------

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I was too hasty. Are there any primes between 5 and 17 that are 1 mod8? Let's see: primes are 2,3,5,7,11,13,17. So, after 5, the next is 17. So, perhaps p=17 is the first prime where n⁴≡-1 mod p² has a solution.



---------------

But wait, let me check p=13. 13 is 5 mod8, so p-1=12, which is divisible by 4 but not 8. So, 8 doesn't divide p(p-1) for p=13, so maybe n⁴≡-1 mod13²=169 has no solution.



---------------

Wait, but maybe I'm wrong. Let me see if there's an n such that n⁴≡-1 mod169.

Hmm, that's a bit tedious, but let's try a few numbers.

Let me see, n=5: 5²=25, 5⁴=625 mod169. 169*3=507, 625-507=118. 118 mod169 is 118, which is not -1.

n=7: 7²=49, 7⁴=49²=2401. 2401 mod169: 169*14=2366. 2401-2366=35. 35≠-1 mod169.

n=10: 10²=100, 10⁴=10000. 169*59=10071. 10000-10071= -71 mod169, which is 98. Not -1.

n=11: 11²=121, 11⁴=14641. Let's compute 14641 mod169.



---------------

Wait, 169*86=169*(80+6)=169*80=13520, 169*6=1014; total 13520+1014=14534.

14641-14534=107. So, 107 mod169, which is not -1.

n=12: 12²=144, 12⁴=144²=20736. 169*122=169*(120+2)=169*120=20280, 169*2=338; total 20280+338=20618. 20736-20618=118. Again, not -1.

n=14: 14²=196, 14⁴=196²=38416. 169*227=169*(200+27)=169*200=33800, 169*27=4563; total 33800+4563=38363. 38416-38363=53. Not -1.

Hmm, this is taking too long. Maybe there's a better way.



---------------

Wait, perhaps for p=17, let's see if there's an n where n⁴≡-1 mod17²=289.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe I can use Hensel's lemma. If I can find a solution mod17, maybe I can lift it to mod17².

So, first, check if n⁴≡-1 mod17 has a solution.

Let me compute n⁴ mod17 for n from 1 to 8, since 17 is prime, and mod17, the residues repeat every 17 numbers.

n=1:1⁴=1 mod17
n=2:16 mod17
n=3:81 mod17. 17*4=68, 81-68=13. So, 13 mod17.
n=4:256 mod17. 17*15=255, 256-255=1 mod17.
n=5:625 mod17. 17*36=612, 625-612=13 mod17.
n=6:6⁴=1296 mod17. 17*76=1292, 1296-1292=4 mod17.
n=7:7⁴=2401 mod17. 17*141=2397, 2401-2397=4 mod17.
n=8:8⁴=4096 mod17. Let's compute 4096/17: 17*241=4097, so 4096≡-1 mod17.



---------------

Wait, so n=8: 8⁴≡-1 mod17.

So, n=8 is a solution to n⁴≡-1 mod17.

Now, can I lift this solution to mod17²=289 using Hensel's lemma?

Hensel's lemma says that if f(n) ≡0 mod p and f'(n) not≡0 mod p, then there's a unique lift mod p².

Here, f(n) = n⁴ +1.

f'(n) = 4n³.

At n=8 mod17, f'(8)=4*(8)^3=4*512=2048.

2048 mod17: Let's compute 17*120=2040, so 2048-2040=8 mod17.

So, f'(8)≡8 mod17, which is not 0. Therefore, Hensel's lemma applies, and there's a unique lift of n=8 mod17 to a solution mod289.

So, the solution mod289 is n=8 +17k for some integer k. Let me compute k.

We need to solve (8 +17k)^4 ≡-1 mod289.

Let me compute (8 +17k)^4 mod289.

Using the binomial theorem:

(8 +17k)^4 = 8^4 + 4*8^3*(17k) + 6*8^2*(17k)^2 + 4*8*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.

But since we're working mod289=17², any term with (17k)^2 or higher will be 0 mod289, because 17²=289.

So, the expansion reduces to:

8^4 + 4*8^3*(17k) mod289.

Compute 8^4: 8^2=64, 8^4=64^2=4096. 4096 mod289: Let's compute 289*14=4046. 4096-4046=50. So, 8^4≡50 mod289.

Then, 4*8^3*(17k): 8^3=512. 4*512=2048. 2048*(17k) = 2048*17k.

But 2048 mod289: Let's compute how many times 289 goes into 2048.

289*7=2023. 2048-2023=25. So, 2048≡25 mod289.

So, 4*8^3*(17k) ≡25*17k mod289.

25*17=425. 425 mod289: 425-289=136. So, 25*17k≡136k mod289.

So, putting it all together:

(8 +17k)^4 ≡50 +136k mod289.

We want this to be ≡-1 mod289, which is 288 mod289.

So, 50 +136k ≡288 mod289.

Subtract 50: 136k ≡238 mod289.

Now, solve for k: 136k ≡238 mod289.

Let me compute the inverse of 136 mod289.

First, check gcd(136,289). 289=17²=289. 136=17*8. So, gcd(136,289)=17. Since 238 is 17*14, the equation 136k ≡238 mod289 has solutions.

Divide both sides by 17: 8k ≡14 mod17.

Now, solve 8k≡14 mod17.

Find the inverse of 8 mod17. 8*2=16≡-1 mod17, so 8*(-2)=1 mod17. So, inverse of 8 is -2=15 mod17.

Multiply both sides by 15: k≡14*15 mod17.

14*15=210. 210 mod17: 17*12=204, 210-204=6. So, k≡6 mod17.

So, k=6 +17m for some integer m.

Thus, the solution mod289 is n=8 +17k=8 +17*(6 +17m)=8 +102 +289m=110 +289m.

So, the smallest positive integer m is 110. 

---------------

Wait, but wait, 110 is less than 289, so that's the solution mod289.



---------------

Wait, but wait, I'm trying to find the minimal m such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by p², which is 289 in this case.

So, the minimal m is 110, but let me check if 110 is the minimal solution.



---------------

Wait, but perhaps there's a smaller positive integer m. Let me check m=110 mod289.



---------------

Wait, 110 is less than 289, so it's the smallest positive integer in its equivalence class.



---------------

Wait, but let me verify if 110⁴ +1 is indeed divisible by 289.

Compute 110 mod17: 17*6=102, 110-102=8. So, 110≡8 mod17, which matches our earlier solution.

But let me compute 110⁴ mod289.



---------------

Alternatively, since we know that 110 is the solution, 110⁴≡-1 mod289. So, 110⁴ +1≡0 mod289, which is what we want.

So, m=110 is the minimal positive integer such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by p²=289.



---------------

Wait, but wait, is there a smaller m than 110? Let me check m=8. 

---------------

Wait, earlier, we saw that 8⁴=4096≡50 mod289, which is not -1. So, 8⁴ +1=4097≡51 mod289≠0.

Similarly, m=25: Let's compute 25⁴ mod289.

25²=625. 625 mod289: 289*2=578, 625-578=47. So, 25²≡47 mod289.

25⁴=(25²)²=47²=2209. 2209 mod289: 289*7=2023, 2209-2023=186. 186≠288, so 25⁴ +1=187≡187 mod289≠0.

Hmm, what about m=44? Let's compute 44 mod17: 44-17*2=10. So, 44≡10 mod17. Let me compute 44⁴ mod289.

Compute 44²=1936. 1936 mod289: 289*6=1734, 1936-1734=202. So, 44²≡202 mod289.

44⁴=(44²)²=202²=40804. Now, 40804 mod289.

Let me compute how many times 289 goes into 40804.

Well, 289*141=289*(140+1)=289*140=40460, plus 289=40460+289=40749.

40804-40749=55. So, 44⁴≡55 mod289. 55+1=56≡56 mod289≠0. So, 44 isn't a solution.

Hmm, perhaps I should check m=110. Let me compute 110 mod17=8, as before.

Compute 110²=12100. 12100 mod289: Let's compute 289*41=289*(40+1)=11560+289=11849.

12100-11849=251. So, 110²≡251 mod289.

110⁴=(110²)²=251²=63001. Now, 63001 mod289.

Compute 289*217=289*(200+17)=289*200=57800, 289*17=4913. So, 57800+4913=62713.

63001-62713=288. So, 110⁴≡288 mod289, which is -1 mod289. So, 110⁴ +1≡0 mod289. So, yes, m=110 works.

Is there a smaller m than 110? Let's see, maybe m=110-289= negative, which isn't positive. So, 110 is the smallest positive integer.



---------------

Wait, but wait a second. Earlier, I thought that p=17 is the smallest prime where such an m exists, but I also considered p=5, which didn't work, and p=13, which also didn't seem to work.

So, the least prime p is 17, and the minimal m is 110.



---------------

Wait, but let me double-check if there's a prime smaller than 17 that satisfies the condition. Wait, p=5 didn't work, p=13 didn't work. So, the next is p=17.

So, the answer should be m=110.


To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) where \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Then, we determine the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

### Step 1: Identify the smallest prime \( p \)
For \( n^4 + 1 \) to be divisible by \( p^2 \), \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \) must have a solution. This requires that \(-1\) is a quartic residue modulo \( p^2 \). 

Using number theory, we know that for an odd prime \( p \), \(-1\) is a quartic residue modulo \( p^2 \) if and only if \( p \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \). The smallest such prime is \( p = 17 \).

### Step 2: Find the smallest \( m \) for \( p = 17 \)
We need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{17^2} \) or \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{289} \).

#### Step 2.1: Solve \( m^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{17} \)
First, solve \( m^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{17} \). Testing small values:
- \( 8^4 = 4096 \equiv -1 \pmod{17} \).

Thus, \( m \equiv 8 \pmod{17} \) is a solution.

#### Step 2.2: Lift the solution to modulo \( 289 \) using Hensel's Lemma
Using Hensel's Lemma, we lift \( m \equiv 8 \pmod{17} \) to a solution modulo \( 289 \). Let \( m = 8 + 17k \). Expanding \( m^4 \) modulo \( 289 \):
\[
(8 + 17k)^4 \equiv 8^4 + 4 \cdot 8^3 \cdot 17k \pmod{289}.
\]
Calculating:
- \( 8^4 = 4096 \equiv 50 \pmod{289} \),
- \( 4 \cdot 8^3 \cdot 17k = 2048 \cdot 17k \equiv 25 \cdot 17k \equiv 136k \pmod{289} \).

Thus:
\[
50 + 136k \equiv -1 \pmod{289} \implies 136k \equiv 238 \pmod{289}.
\]
Dividing by \( \gcd(136, 289) = 17 \):
\[
8k \equiv 14 \pmod{17}.
\]
The inverse of \( 8 \) modulo \( 17 \) is \( 15 \), so:
\[
k \equiv 14 \cdot 15 \equiv 210 \equiv 6 \pmod{17}.
\]
Thus, \( k = 6 + 17m \), and substituting back:
\[
m = 8 + 17 \cdot 6 = 110.
\]

### Conclusion
The smallest prime \( p \) is \( 17 \), and the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 = 289 \) is \( 110 \).

\[
\boxed{110}
\]
