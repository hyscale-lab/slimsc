Okay, so I have this problem about rectangular boxes with a fixed surface area and volume. The goal is to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, and then compute r squared, which will be a fraction p/q. Finally, I need to find p + q.

First, let's parse the problem. We have a set B of rectangular boxes where each box has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. We need to find the minimal sphere that can contain any such box. The radius of this sphere will be half the space diagonal of the box because the sphere must enclose the entire box, so the diameter of the sphere must be at least the space diagonal of the box.

So, the key here is to find the maximum possible space diagonal among all such boxes in set B, and then r will be half of that maximum diagonal. Then, we can compute r squared.

Let me denote the dimensions of the box as x, y, z. So, the surface area S is given by 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, and the volume V is xyz = 23.

We need to find the maximum value of sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2), which is the space diagonal, and then r would be half of that.

So, the problem reduces to optimizing (maximizing) the space diagonal given the constraints on surface area and volume.

To approach this, maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers because it's an optimization problem with constraints.

Let me write down the functions:

Objective function to maximize: f(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2.

Constraints:
1. g(x, y, z) = 2(xy + yz + zx) - 54 = 0.
2. h(x, y, z) = xyz - 23 = 0.

So, we need to find the maximum of f(x,y,z) subject to g(x,y,z)=0 and h(x,y,z)=0.

Using the method of Lagrange multipliers for multiple constraints, we set up the system:

∇f = λ∇g + μ∇h.

So, compute the gradients.

∇f = (2x, 2y, 2z).

∇g = (2(y + z), 2(x + z), 2(x + y)).

∇h = (yz, xz, xy).

So, the equations become:

2x = λ * 2(y + z) + μ * yz,
2y = λ * 2(x + z) + μ * xz,
2z = λ * 2(x + y) + μ * xy.

Hmm, that's three equations.

Additionally, we have the constraints:

2(xy + yz + zx) = 54,
xyz = 23.

So, five equations with five variables: x, y, z, λ, μ.

This looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can find some symmetry or assume that two variables are equal to simplify.

In optimization problems with symmetric functions, often the extrema occur when variables are equal or in some proportion.

Let me assume that x = y, which might simplify things. Let's see if that assumption holds.

If x = y, then the equations become:

2x = λ * 2(x + z) + μ * xz,
2x = λ * 2(x + z) + μ * xz,
2z = λ * 2(2x) + μ * x^2.

So, the first two equations are the same, which is consistent.

So, from the first equation:

2x = 2λ(x + z) + μ x z.

Similarly, the third equation becomes:

2z = λ * 4x + μ x^2.

So, now we have:

Equation 1: 2x = 2λ(x + z) + μ x z.
Equation 3: 2z = 4λ x + μ x^2.

Let me denote these as Eq1 and Eq3.

Also, we have the constraints:

Surface area: 2(x^2 + x z + x z) = 54 ⇒ 2(x^2 + 2x z) = 54 ⇒ x^2 + 2x z = 27.

Volume: x * x * z = x^2 z = 23.

So, let me write down these two:

x^2 + 2x z = 27 → (1)
x^2 z = 23 → (2)

From (2): z = 23 / (x^2).

Substitute into (1):

x^2 + 2x*(23 / x^2) = 27 ⇒ x^2 + 46 / x = 27.

Multiply both sides by x:

x^3 + 46 = 27 x ⇒ x^3 -27x +46 =0.

Hmm, solving this cubic equation. Let's see if it has rational roots.

Possible rational roots are factors of 46 over 1: ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x=1: 1 -27 +46 = 20 ≠0.
x=2: 8 -54 +46= 0. Oh, x=2 is a root.

So, we can factor out (x-2):

Using polynomial division or synthetic division.

Divide x^3 -27x +46 by (x-2):

Coefficients: 1 (x^3), 0 (x^2), -27 (x), 46.

Bring down 1.

Multiply by 2: 2.

Add to next term: 0 +2=2.

Multiply by 2: 4.

Add to next term: -27 +4= -23.

Multiply by 2: -46.

Add to last term: 46 + (-46)=0.

So, quotient is x^2 +2x -23.

Thus, x^3 -27x +46 = (x -2)(x^2 +2x -23).

Set equal to zero: x=2 or x^2 +2x -23=0.

Solving x^2 +2x -23=0: x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4 sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2 sqrt(6).

Since x is a length, it must be positive. So, x=2 or x= -1 + 2 sqrt(6). Since sqrt(6)≈2.45, 2 sqrt(6)≈4.90. So, -1 +4.90≈3.90, which is positive. So, x=2 or x≈3.90.

So, possible x values are 2 and approximately 3.90.

Now, let's consider x=2. Then, from (2): z=23/(2^2)=23/4=5.75.

So, x=y=2, z=5.75.

Check if this satisfies the original equations.

But before that, let me see if this is a maximum or a minimum.



---------------

Wait, we assumed x=y, so perhaps the maximum occurs when x=y, but maybe not. But let's see.



---------------

Alternatively, the other solution is x=-1 + 2 sqrt(6). Let me compute that.

Compute x= -1 + 2√6 ≈ -1 +4.898 ≈3.898.

Then, z=23/(x^2). Let me compute x^2:

x= -1 +2√6, so x^2= ( -1 +2√6 )^2 =1 -4√6 + (2√6)^2=1 -4√6 +24=25 -4√6.

Thus, z=23/(25 -4√6).

To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

z=23*(25 +4√6)/[(25)^2 - (4√6)^2] =23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 16*6)=23*(25 +4√6)/(625-96)=23*(25 +4√6)/529.

Simplify: 529 is 23^2, so 23 cancels:

z=(25 +4√6)/23.

So, z≈ (25 +4*2.449)/23≈(25 +9.796)/23≈34.796/23≈1.513.

So, x≈3.898, y≈3.898, z≈1.513.

Now, let's see which of these two cases (x=2, z=5.75 or x≈3.898, z≈1.513) gives a larger space diagonal.

Compute x^2 + y^2 + z^2 for each.

Case 1: x=2, y=2, z=5.75.

Space diagonal squared: 2^2 +2^2 +5.75^2=4 +4 +33.0625=41.0625.

Case 2: x≈3.898, y≈3.898, z≈1.513.

Compute 3.898^2 +3.898^2 +1.513^2.

Compute 3.898^2: approx (3.9)^2=15.21, but more accurately, 3.898*3.898≈ (4 -0.102)^2=16 - 2*4*0.102 +0.102^2≈16 -0.816 +0.0104≈15.1944.

So, two times that is ≈30.3888.

z^2≈1.513^2≈2.289.

Total≈30.3888 +2.289≈32.6778.

So, case 1 gives a larger space diagonal squared (41.0625) compared to case 2 (~32.6778). So, the maximum occurs at x=2, y=2, z=5.75.



---------------

Wait, but is that necessarily the maximum? Because we assumed x=y, but maybe the maximum occurs when all variables are different.

Hmm, so perhaps the assumption x=y gives us a local maximum, but maybe the global maximum occurs elsewhere.

So, to confirm, maybe I should consider the general case without assuming x=y.

But solving the Lagrange multipliers without assuming x=y is more complex. Let me think.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe I can use the method of substitution.

We have two constraints: 2(xy + yz + zx)=54 and xyz=23.

Let me denote S = x + y + z, P = xy + yz + zx =27, and Q=xyz=23.

We are to maximize x^2 + y^2 + z^2.

Note that x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx) = S^2 - 2P.

Since P is fixed at 27, then x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = S^2 - 54.

So, to maximize x^2 + y^2 + z^2, we need to maximize S^2, i.e., maximize S.

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible value of S, given that P=27 and Q=23.

So, the maximum of S^2 -54 will give the maximum of x^2 + y^2 + z^2.

Thus, our task is to maximize S, the sum of the sides, given P=27 and Q=23.

Is there a known inequality or method to maximize S given P and Q?

I remember that for positive real numbers, there are inequalities involving S, P, Q.

The AM ≥ GM inequality, but that might not directly help here.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps using the method of Lagrange multipliers again, but this time considering S as the function to maximize with the constraints P=27 and Q=23.



---------------

Wait, but that's similar to what I was trying earlier. Let's try that.

Let me set up the Lagrangian with function f(x, y, z) = x + y + z.

Constraints:
g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + zx -27 =0,
h(x, y, z) = xyz -23=0.

Then, the Lagrangian is L = x + y + z - λ(xy + yz +zx -27) - μ(xyz -23).

Taking partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x = 1 - λ(y + z) - μ yz =0,
∂L/∂y = 1 - λ(x + z) - μ xz =0,
∂L/∂z = 1 - λ(x + y) - μ xy =0.

So, we have:

1 = λ(y + z) + μ yz, (1)
1 = λ(x + z) + μ xz, (2)
1 = λ(x + y) + μ xy. (3)

Subtract (1)-(2):

0 = λ(y + z - x - z) + μ(yz - xz) ⇒ 0 = λ(y -x) + μ z (y -x).

Factor out (y -x):

(y -x)(λ + μ z)=0.

So, either y = x, or λ + μ z=0.

Similarly, subtract (2)-(3):

0=λ(x + z -x - y) + μ(xz - xy) ⇒ 0=λ(z - y) + μ x(z - y).

Factor out (z - y):

(z - y)(λ + μ x)=0.

So, either z = y or λ + μ x=0.

Similarly, subtract (1)-(3):

0=λ(y + z -x - y) + μ(yz - xy) ⇒ 0=λ(z -x) + μ y (z -x).

Factor out (z -x):

(z -x)(λ + μ y)=0.

So, either z =x or λ + μ y=0.

So, from these, either variables are equal or λ + μ times another variable is zero.

Case 1: All variables are equal.

If x=y=z, then from the volume constraint: x^3=23 ⇒x= cube root of 23≈2.84. But let's see if this satisfies the surface area.

Surface area: 6x^2=54 ⇒x^2=9 ⇒x=3. But 3^3=27≠23. So, this is a contradiction. So, variables cannot all be equal.

Case 2: Two variables are equal.

Assume x=y. Then, from earlier, we have the two cases: either x=2, z=5.75, or x≈3.898, z≈1.513.

In the first case, x=2, y=2, z=5.75.

In the second case, x≈3.898, y≈3.898, z≈1.513.

From the earlier calculation, in the first case, S =2 +2 +5.75=9.75, whereas in the second case, S≈3.898 +3.898 +1.513≈9.309.

So, the first case gives a larger S.



---------------

But wait, when x=y=2, z=5.75, S=9.75, which is higher than the other case.

So, perhaps x=y=2, z=5.75 is the maximum.

But earlier, when we assumed x=y, we found two possible solutions, but the one with x=2 gives a higher S. So, maybe that is the maximum.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum S occurs when x≠y≠z.

But it's difficult to solve the system without the assumption.



---------------

Alternatively, let's see if the case x=2, y=2, z=5.75 is a critical point.

From earlier, when x=2, y=2, z=5.75, let's check if the Lagrangian conditions hold.

Compute λ and μ.

From equation (1): 1 = λ(y + z) + μ yz.

Plug in y=2, z=5.75.

So, 1 = λ(2 +5.75) + μ*(2*5.75).

Which is 1= λ*7.75 + μ*11.5.

Similarly, equation (2) is the same as equation (1) because x=y.

Equation (3): 1 = λ(x + y) + μ xy.

x=2, y=2.

So, 1= λ*(4) + μ*(4).

Thus, 1=4λ +4μ.

So, from equation (3): 4λ +4μ =1 ⇒ λ + μ = 1/4.

From equation (1): 7.75λ +11.5 μ =1.

Express λ = (1/4 - μ).

Substitute into equation (1):

7.75*(1/4 - μ) +11.5 μ =1.

Compute 7.75*(1/4)=7.75/4≈1.9375.

7.75*(-μ) +11.5 μ = ( -7.75 +11.5 ) μ ≈3.75 μ.

So, 1.9375 +3.75 μ =1.

Thus, 3.75 μ =1 -1.9375= -0.9375.

Thus, μ= (-0.9375)/3.75= -0.25.

Then, λ=1/4 - (-0.25)=1/4 +1/4=0.5.

So, λ=0.5, μ=-0.25.

Thus, these values satisfy the equations.

Therefore, x=y=2, z=5.75 is a critical point.

Similarly, in the other case, x≈3.898, y≈3.898, z≈1.513.



---------------

But wait, in that case, perhaps the Lagrangian conditions are also satisfied, but let's not check that.

Given that, in this critical point, we have S=9.75, which is higher than the other case, and it satisfies the Lagrangian conditions, so perhaps it's a maximum.

But we should also check if this is indeed a maximum.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the other case is a minimum.

But since we're looking for the maximum sphere that can contain any of the boxes, we need the maximum space diagonal.

Thus, the maximum occurs at x=2, y=2, z=5.75, giving a space diagonal squared of 41.0625.



---------------

Wait, 41.0625 is 41 and 1/16, since 0.0625=1/16. So, 41.0625=41 1/16= 657/16.



---------------

Wait, 41*16=656, plus 1 is 657. So, 657/16.



---------------

Wait, 41.0625=41 +0.0625=41 +1/16= (41*16 +1)/16= (656 +1)/16=657/16.

So, the space diagonal squared is 657/16, so the radius r is half the space diagonal, so r squared is (sqrt(657/16))/2 squared?



---------------

Wait, no. Wait, the space diagonal is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So, the space diagonal is sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4.

Then, the radius r is half of that, so r= sqrt(657)/(4*2)=sqrt(657)/8.



---------------

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the space diagonal is the diameter of the sphere. So, the radius is half the space diagonal.



---------------

Wait, no. Wait, the space diagonal is the maximum distance between any two points in the box, which would be the diameter of the smallest sphere that can contain the box. Therefore, the radius is half the space diagonal.

So, the radius squared is (space diagonal /2)^2= (space diagonal squared)/4.

So, if the space diagonal squared is 657/16, then r squared is (657/16)/4=657/(64).



---------------

Wait, that seems too big. Wait, 657/16 is the space diagonal squared. Then, the radius is half of the space diagonal, so radius squared is (space diagonal squared)/4.

So, yes, 657/(16*4)=657/64.



---------------

Wait, 657 divided by 64.

Wait, but 657 and 64: 64 is 2^6, 657 divided by 3 is 219, then 219 divided by 3 is 73. So, 657=3^2 *73. 64 is 2^6. So, they are coprime since 73 is a prime number and doesn't divide into 2. So, p=657, q=64. Thus, p+q=657+64=721.



---------------

Wait, but earlier, I thought the space diagonal squared was 657/16, so r squared is 657/64.



---------------

But wait, wait, let me double-check.

Wait, the space diagonal is sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4.

Then, the radius is half of that, so sqrt(657)/8.

Thus, r squared is (sqrt(657)/8)^2=657/64.

Yes, that's correct.



---------------

But wait, I thought earlier that the space diagonal squared was 41.0625, which is 657/16. But 41.0625 * (1/4)=10.265625, which is 657/64≈10.265625.

So, 657 divided by 64 is 10.265625.



---------------

Wait, but let me make sure that this is indeed the maximum.

Because, in the case where x=y=2, z=5.75, we get the space diagonal squared as 657/16, which is 41.0625, which is the maximum.

But earlier, when I assumed x=y, I found another critical point where x≈3.898, y≈3.898, z≈1.513, which gave a lower space diagonal squared. So, that's probably a local minimum.

Thus, the maximum occurs at x=y=2, z=5.75.



---------------

Wait, but let me think about another approach. Maybe using the AM-QM inequality.

Wait, the space diagonal squared is x² + y² + z², and we want to maximize this given the constraints on surface area and volume.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps using some substitution.

Let me consider variables a, b, c such that a=xy, b=yz, c=zx.

Then, the surface area is 2(a + b + c)=54 ⇒a + b + c=27.

The volume is xyz=23.

But we can write xyz=23 ⇒x=23/(yz)=23/(b), since a=xy, c=zx.



---------------

Wait, maybe this substitution complicates things.

Alternatively, let me consider using the method of Lagrange multipliers without assuming x=y.

We have the three equations:

1 = λ(y + z) + μ yz, (1)
1 = λ(x + z) + μ xz, (2)
1 = λ(x + y) + μ xy. (3)

Let me subtract equation (1) - equation (2):

0 = λ(y + z - x - z) + μ(yz - xz) ⇒ 0=λ(y -x) + μ z (y -x).

So, (y -x)(λ + μ z)=0.

Similarly, from (2)-(3):

0=λ(x + z -x - y) + μ(xz - xy)=λ(z - y) + μ x (z - y)= (z - y)(λ + μ x)=0.

And from (1)-(3):

0=λ(y + z -x - y) + μ(yz - xy)=λ(z -x) + μ y (z -x)= (z -x)(λ + μ y)=0.

So, for each pair, either two variables are equal, or λ + μ times the third variable is zero.

So, possibilities:

1. x=y=z: We saw this is impossible because x^3=23 and 6x²=54 implies x=3, but 3^3=27≠23.

2. Two variables equal, third different.

Assume x=y≠z.

Then, as before, we get x=2, z=5.75 or x≈3.898, z≈1.513.

But as we saw, the first gives a larger space diagonal.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe another case where all three variables are different, but the other conditions hold.

But solving that case would be more complicated.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal, as in case 1.

Since in case 1, we get a valid solution, and it gives a higher space diagonal, perhaps that is indeed the maximum.

Thus, the maximum space diagonal squared is 657/16, so r squared is 657/64.

Simplify 657 and 64: 657 divided by 3 is 219, which is 3*73. 64 is 2^6. No common factors, so 657/64 is reduced.

Thus, p=657, q=64, so p+q=657+64=721.


To solve the problem, we consider rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. The goal is to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any such box, which is half the space diagonal of the box. 

Let the dimensions of the box be \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). The surface area constraint is \(2(xy + yz + zx) = 54\), and the volume constraint is \(xyz = 23\). The space diagonal of the box is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}\), and we aim to maximize this value.

Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, we set up the system to maximize \(f(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) subject to the constraints \(g(x, y, z) = 2(xy + yz + zx) - 54 = 0\) and \(h(x, y, z) = xyz - 23 = 0\). After solving the system, we find that the maximum space diagonal occurs when \(x = y = 2\) and \(z = \frac{23}{4} = 5.75\).

The space diagonal squared is calculated as:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 + \left(\frac{23}{4}\right)^2 = 4 + 4 + \frac{529}{16} = \frac{657}{16}.
\]
The radius \(r\) of the sphere is half the space diagonal, so \(r^2 = \frac{657}{64}\). Since 657 and 64 are coprime, we have \(p = 657\) and \(q = 64\), giving \(p + q = 721\).

\[
\boxed{721}
\]
