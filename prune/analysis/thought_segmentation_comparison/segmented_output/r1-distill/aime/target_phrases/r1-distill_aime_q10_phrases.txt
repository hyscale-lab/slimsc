Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but I think I can break it down.

First, since \( |z| = 4 \), I know that \( z \) lies on a circle in the complex plane with radius 4. So, I can represent \( z \) in its polar form, right? That would make things easier, maybe. So, \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). 

---------------

Alternatively, I could write \( z = 4(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \). Either way, both forms might be useful later.

Now, the expression we're dealing with is \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\]. Let me denote this expression as \( E \) for simplicity. So, \( E = (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \).

Since I need to find the maximum real part of \( E \), I should probably express \( E \) in terms of \( \theta \) and then find its real part. Then, I can maximize that real part with respect to \( \theta \).

Let me start by substituting \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) into \( E \). Then, \( 1/z = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \) because \( |z| = 4 \), so \( 1/z = \overline{z}/|z|^2 \), which in this case is \( \overline{z}/16 \). 

---------------

Wait, but since \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), \( \overline{z} = 4e^{-i\theta} \), so \( 1/z = \overline{z}/16 \) which is \( (4e^{-i\theta})/16 = (1/4)e^{-i\theta} \). That makes sense.

So, substituting into \( E \):

\( E = (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + (96 + 144i) \cdot \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \).

Let me compute each part separately.

First term: \( (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} \).

Second term: \( (96 + 144i) \cdot \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \).

Let me compute the coefficients:

First term coefficient: \( 4(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i \).

Second term coefficient: \( \frac{1}{4}(96 + 144i) = 24 + 36i \).

So now, \( E = (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

Hmm, okay. Now, I need to compute this expression and find its real part.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe I can write \( e^{i\theta} \) as \( \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \), and \( e^{-i\theta} \) as \( \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \). Let me try that.

So, expanding \( E \):

First term: \( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \).

Second term: \( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \).

Let me compute each part.

First, compute the first term:

Multiply \( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \).

Using distributive property:

= 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2 \sin\theta.

Since \( i^2 = -1 \), this becomes:

= 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta.

Now, group the real and imaginary parts:

Real part: 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta.

Imaginary part: (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta) i.

Similarly, compute the second term:

\( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \).

Again, distribute:

= 24\cos\theta -24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta -36i^2 \sin\theta.

Simplify \( i^2 = -1 \):

= 24\cos\theta -24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta +36\sin\theta.

Group real and imaginary parts:

Real part: 24\cos\theta +36\sin\theta.

Imaginary part: (-24\sin\theta +36\cos\theta) i.

Now, adding the first and second terms together to get E:

Real parts: (300\cosθ -468\sinθ) + (24cosθ +36sinθ) = (300 +24)cosθ + (-468 +36) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Imaginary parts: (300 sinθ +468 cosθ) i + (-24 sinθ +36 cosθ) i = [300 sinθ -24 sinθ +468 cosθ +36 cosθ] i = (276 sinθ + 504 cosθ) i.

So, the entire expression E is:

E = (324 cosθ - 432 sinθ) + (276 sinθ + 504 cosθ) i.

But we are interested in the real part of E, which is Re(E) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So, the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of Re(E) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, okay. So, now I have Re(E) as a function of θ: Re(E)(θ) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

I need to find the maximum value of this function. I remember that expressions of the form a cosθ + b sinθ can be rewritten as R cos(θ + φ), where R = sqrt(a² + b²) and φ is some phase shift. The maximum value of such an expression is R, so that would give me the maximum real part.



---------------

Wait, but in our case, it's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So, it's like a cosθ + b sinθ, but with a negative sign. Let me write it as:

Re(E)(θ) = 324 cosθ + (-432) sinθ.

So, a = 324, b = -432.

The maximum value of a cosθ + b sinθ is sqrt(a² + b²). So, the maximum Re(E) is sqrt(324² + 432²).

Let me compute that.

First, compute 324 squared:

324^2: 324 * 324. Let me compute that.

300^2 = 90,000, 24^2=576, and cross term 2*300*24=14,400.

So, 324^2 = (300 +24)^2 = 300² + 2*300*24 +24² = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 90,000 + 14,400 is 104,400; plus 576 is 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2: 432*432.

Hmm, 400^2=160,000, 32^2=1,024, cross term 2*400*32=25,600.

So, 432^2 = (400 +32)^2 = 400² + 2*400*32 +32² = 160,000 +25,600 +1,024.

160,000 +25,600 is 185,600; plus 1,024 is 186,624.

So, a² + b² = 324² + (-432)^2 = 104,976 + 186,624.

Adding those together: 104,976 + 186,624.

104,976 + 186,624: 100,000 + 180,000 = 280,000; 4,976 +6,624=11,600. So total is 280,000 +11,600 = 291,600.

So, sqrt(291,600) is the maximum Re(E). Let me compute that.

I know that 540^2 = 291,600, because 54^2 = 2,916, so 540^2 = (54*10)^2 =54² *100=2,916*100=291,600. So sqrt(291,600) =540.



---------------

Wait, that's nice. So the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but hold on. Let me think again. Because in the expression Re(E) = a cosθ + b sinθ, the maximum is sqrt(a² + b²). So yes, in this case, 324^2 +432^2 = 104,976 +186,624 =291,600. So sqrt(291,600)=540.

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.



---------------

But wait, let me double-check if I did everything correctly. Because sometimes when you have a function like a cosθ + b sinθ, you can also write it as R cos(theta - phi) or something, but regardless, the maximum is R = sqrt(a² + b²).

In this case, a is 324, b is -432. So, yeah, sqrt(324² +432²) is sqrt(104,976 +186,624)=sqrt(291,600)=540.

So, I think that's correct.

But let me just think again about the setup. The expression E is given as (75+117i) z + (96+144i)/z, with |z|=4.

I converted z into 4e^{iθ}, which is correct because |z|=4.

Then, I expanded E correctly, breaking it into real and imaginary parts, and then I correctly identified the real part as Re(E)=324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the maximum real part is 540.

I think that's the answer.


To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in polar form as \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Substituting \(z\) into the expression, we get:

\[
E = (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}
\]

Simplifying each term:

\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} = (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta}
\]
\[
\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Expanding these using \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\), we compute the real and imaginary parts:

\[
(300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) = 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)
\]
\[
(24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) = 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta + i(-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)
\]

Adding the real parts and imaginary parts separately:

\[
\text{Real part: } (300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta
\]
\[
\text{Imaginary part: } (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta) + (-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta) = 276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta
\]

The real part of \(E\) is \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). To find its maximum, we use the fact that the maximum of \(a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta\) is \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\):

\[
\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540
\]

Thus, the largest possible real part is \(\boxed{540}\).
