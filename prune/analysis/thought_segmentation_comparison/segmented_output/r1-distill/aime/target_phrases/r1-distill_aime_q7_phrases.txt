Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that when dealing with equations involving sums and products, sometimes symmetry can be exploited. The given equation is symmetric in a, b, and c, which suggests that maybe I can find a way to express it in terms of symmetric sums or something like that.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. Maybe I can factor this somehow. Let me try to factor it.



---------------

Wait, I think I can rewrite the expression as a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b). That's because, for example, a²b + a²c = a²(b + c), and similarly for the other terms. So, the entire expression becomes a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c). So substituting these into the expression, it becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c).

So, the second equation simplifies to a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay. So now I have:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

I need to find all nonnegative integer triples (a, b, c) that satisfy both equations. Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can express this in terms of symmetric functions or find a way to relate it to the sum a + b + c.

Let me consider expanding the expression a²(300 - a). That would be 300a² - a³. Similarly for the other terms. So, the entire expression becomes:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

So, 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay, so I have an equation involving a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³. I also know that a + b + c = 300. Maybe I can express a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of the sums of a, ab, etc.

I remember that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc). So, since a + b + c = 300, then 300² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc). That gives me a² + b² + c² = 300² - 2(ab + ac + bc).

Similarly, I think there's a formula for a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of a + b + c, ab + ac + bc, and abc. The formula is a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc.

So, let me write down these expressions:

Let S = a + b + c = 300.

Let P = ab + ac + bc.

Let Q = abc.

Then,

a² + b² + c² = S² - 2P = 300² - 2P.

And,

a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3SP + 3Q.

Substituting these into the equation I had earlier:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Which becomes:

300*(300² - 2P) - [300³ - 3*300*P + 3Q] = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute 300*(300² - 2P):

300*(300²) = 300*90,000 = 27,000,000.

300*( -2P ) = -600P.

So, the first term is 27,000,000 - 600P.

Now, the second part is subtracting [300³ - 3*300*P + 3Q]. Let me compute each term inside the brackets:

300³ = 27,000,000.

3*300*P = 900P.

3Q remains as is.

So, the bracket is 27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q.

Putting it all together:

27,000,000 - 600P - (27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q) = 6,000,000.

Let's distribute the negative sign:

27,000,000 - 600P - 27,000,000 + 900P - 3Q = 6,000,000.

Simplify terms:

(27,000,000 - 27,000,000) + (-600P + 900P) - 3Q = 6,000,000.

So, that simplifies to:

0 + 300P - 3Q = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3 to simplify:

100P - Q = 2,000,000.

So, now I have an equation involving P and Q: 100P - Q = 2,000,000.

Which can be rewritten as Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

Now, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, Q = abc must also be a nonnegative integer. So, 100P - 2,000,000 must be ≥ 0.

Therefore, 100P ≥ 2,000,000 → P ≥ 20,000.

So, P must be at least 20,000.

But I also know that for nonnegative integers a, b, c with a + b + c = 300, the maximum possible value of P (ab + ac + bc) is when two variables are as large as possible, and the third is as small as possible. Let me think about that. For example, if one variable is 0, then the other two sum to 300. Then, ab would be maximized when a and b are as close as possible to each other, so around 150 each. So, ab would be around 22500, and ac and bc would be 0. So, in that case, P would be 22500.



---------------

Wait, but that's just one scenario. Actually, the maximum of ab + ac + bc occurs when all variables are as equal as possible. Let me see.



---------------

Wait, no, actually, I think when two variables are as large as possible, and the third is as small as possible, then ab would be large. Let me check. Let's say c=0, then a + b = 300. Then ab is maximized when a = b = 150, so ab = 22500. Then ac = 0, bc = 0, so P = 22500.

But if all three variables are equal, then a = b = c = 100. Then, ab + ac + bc = 3*(100*100) = 30,000. Which is larger than 22500. So, the maximum P is 30,000 when a = b = c = 100.



---------------

Wait, but that's when all variables are equal. So, in that case, P = 3*(100)^2 = 30,000.

So, P can range from a minimum of when two variables are 0 and the third is 300. Then, ab + ac + bc = 0. 

---------------

But wait, in our case, P must be at least 20,000 because Q = 100P - 2,000,000 ≥ 0.



---------------

Wait, so if P is at least 20,000, then the possible range of P is from 20,000 up to 30,000.

So, P ∈ [20,000, 30,000].

Now, I have Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

So, for each possible P in that range, Q is determined as 100P - 2,000,000.

But since Q is the product abc, which is nonnegative, and given that a, b, c are nonnegative integers summing to 300, I need to find all triples (a, b, c) where a + b + c = 300, ab + ac + bc = P, and abc = Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

Hmm, so for each P from 20,000 to 30,000, I can compute Q and then check if there exist nonnegative integers a, b, c such that a + b + c = 300, ab + ac + bc = P, and abc = Q.

But this seems a bit broad. Maybe I can find a way to relate these variables more directly.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for given S = 300, P, and Q, the variables a, b, c are the roots of the cubic equation x³ - Sx² + Px - Q = 0. So, x³ - 300x² + Px - Q = 0.

Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, this cubic must factor into (x - a)(x - b)(x - c) = 0.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can think about the possible values of a, b, c.



---------------

Wait, let me think about the problem again. The original equations are a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.



---------------

Another approach: Maybe I can factor this expression.

Wait, I remember that a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.



---------------

Wait, is that correct? Let me check.

Let me compute (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a(ab + bc + ca) + b(ab + bc + ca) + c(ab + bc + ca).

Which is a²b + a b c + a c² + a b² + b²c + b c a + a c b + b c² + c²a.



---------------

Wait, that's a lot. Let me see:

Wait, (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a(ab) + a(bc) + a(ca) + b(ab) + b(bc) + b(ca) + c(ab) + c(bc) + c(ca).

Simplify each term:

= a²b + abc + a²c + ab² + b²c + abc + abc + bc² + c²a.

So, combining like terms:

= a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + bc² + c²a + 3abc.

So, (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + bc² + c²a + 3abc.

Comparing this to the given expression, which is a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + bc² + c²a = 6,000,000.

So, the given expression is equal to (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.

Therefore, 6,000,000 = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.

Given that a + b + c = 300, this becomes:

6,000,000 = 300 * (ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.

Divide both sides by 3:

2,000,000 = 100 * (ab + bc + ca) - abc.

Which can be written as:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

So, 100P - Q = 2,000,000.

Which is exactly the equation we derived earlier. So, that checks out.

So, the key equation is 100P - Q = 2,000,000, with P = ab + bc + ca and Q = abc.

Given that, and knowing that a + b + c = 300, we need to find all nonnegative integer triples (a, b, c) such that these conditions hold.

Now, perhaps it's useful to consider that for a given sum S = a + b + c, the product abc is maximized when a, b, c are as equal as possible. But in our case, the product Q is determined by P via Q = 100P - 2,000,000. So, for each P, Q is fixed.

But how can I find all possible triples (a, b, c) that satisfy these conditions? Maybe I can think of a substitution or find constraints on a, b, c.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that if a, b, c are all equal, then a = b = c = 100. Let me check if that satisfies the conditions.

If a = b = c = 100:

Then, a + b + c = 300, which is good.

Then, ab + bc + ca = 3*(100*100) = 30,000, so P = 30,000.

Then, Q = abc = 100^3 = 1,000,000.

Substituting into 100P - Q: 100*30,000 - 1,000,000 = 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 2,000,000. So yes, that works.

So, (100, 100, 100) is a solution.

But are there other solutions? Let me think.

Suppose that two of the variables are equal, say a = b, and c is different. Then, perhaps we can find a solution.

Let me try setting a = b, so let's let a = b = x, and c = 300 - 2x.

Then, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, x can range from 0 to 150.

Now, let's compute P and Q in terms of x.

P = ab + ac + bc = x^2 + x*(300 - 2x) + x*(300 - 2x) = x^2 + 2x*(300 - 2x) = x^2 + 600x - 4x^2 = -3x^2 + 600x.

Similarly, Q = abc = x * x * (300 - 2x) = x^2*(300 - 2x) = 300x^2 - 2x^3.

Now, from the equation 100P - Q = 2,000,000, substituting P and Q:

100*(-3x^2 + 600x) - (300x^2 - 2x^3) = 2,000,000.

Let's compute this:

100*(-3x² + 600x) = -300x² + 60,000x.

Subtracting (300x² - 2x³) gives:

-300x² + 60,000x - 300x² + 2x³.

Combine like terms:

2x³ - 600x² + 60,000x.

Set equal to 2,000,000:

2x³ - 600x² + 60,000x = 2,000,000.

Divide both sides by 2:

x³ - 300x² + 30,000x = 1,000,000.

Bring all terms to one side:

x³ - 300x² + 30,000x - 1,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, now I need to solve this cubic equation for integer x in [0, 150].

Let me try to see if I can find integer roots. Maybe using Rational Root Theorem, possible roots are factors of 1,000,000.

But that's a lot, so perhaps I can try plugging in some values.

Let me try x = 100:

100³ - 300*(100)^2 + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000

= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0.

So, x = 100 is a root.

Therefore, (x - 100) is a factor.

Let me perform polynomial division or factor it out.

Dividing x³ - 300x² + 30,000x - 1,000,000 by (x - 100):

Using synthetic division:

100 | 1   -300    30,000    -1,000,000
          100     -20,000      1,000,000
        -------------------------------
          1    -200     10,000          0

So, the cubic factors as (x - 100)(x² - 200x + 10,000).

Now, set the quadratic equal to zero:

x² - 200x + 10,000 = 0.

Solving using quadratic formula:

x = [200 ± sqrt(200² - 4*1*10,000)] / 2.

Compute discriminant: 40,000 - 40,000 = 0.

So, x = 200 / 2 = 100.

So, the equation has a double root at x = 100.

Therefore, the only real solution is x = 100.

So, when a = b = x = 100, then c = 300 - 2x = 100. So, this is the same solution as before, where a = b = c = 100.

So, in the case where a = b, the only solution is the symmetric one.

Hmm, so maybe the only solution is when all three variables are equal? Let me check another case.

Suppose that one of the variables is zero. Let's say c = 0. Then, a + b = 300, and the equation becomes:

a²b + a²*0 + b²a + b²*0 + 0²a + 0²b = a²b + b²a = ab(a + b) = ab*300.

We are given that this equals 6,000,000.

So, 300ab = 6,000,000 → ab = 20,000.

So, we have a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000.

We can solve for a and b.

Let me set up the quadratic equation: x² - 300x + 20,000 = 0.

Compute discriminant: 300² - 4*1*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000.

Square root of discriminant is 100.

Solutions: x = [300 ± 100]/2 → x = 200 or x = 100.

So, when c = 0, possible solutions are (200, 100, 0) and (100, 200, 0). But since a and b are nonnegative integers, these are valid.

Now, let's check if these satisfy the second equation.

For (200, 100, 0):

Compute a + b + c = 200 + 100 + 0 = 300, which is correct.

Compute a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

= 200²*100 + 200²*0 + 100²*200 + 100²*0 + 0²*200 + 0²*100.

= (40,000 * 100) + 0 + (10,000 * 200) + 0 + 0 + 0.

= 4,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 6,000,000. So, that works.

Similarly, (100, 200, 0) would give the same result.

So, these are valid solutions.



---------------

Wait, so when c = 0, there are two solutions: (200, 100, 0) and (100, 200, 0). But since the problem counts ordered triples, these are distinct.



---------------

Wait, but earlier when a = b = c = 100, that's a single solution.

So, so far, I have three solutions: (100, 100, 100), (200, 100, 0), and (100, 200, 0). 

---------------

But wait, actually, in the case where c = 0, the permutations would give more solutions.

Wait, because in the case where c = 0, the solutions are (200, 100, 0) and (100, 200, 0). But also, if a = 0, then similar solutions exist: (0, 200, 100) and (0, 100, 200). Similarly, if b = 0, we have (200, 0, 100) and (100, 0, 200). So, actually, for each permutation where one variable is zero and the other two are 200 and 100, there are 3 variables, each can be zero, leading to 2 solutions per zero variable, so 6 solutions in total.



---------------

Wait, let me check: If c = 0, then a and b are 200 and 100, which can be arranged in two ways: (200, 100, 0) and (100, 200, 0). Similarly, if a = 0, then b and c are 200 and 100, leading to (0, 200, 100) and (0, 100, 200). If b = 0, then a and c are 200 and 100, leading to (200, 0, 100) and (100, 0, 200). So, that's 2 solutions per zero variable, and 3 zero variables, totaling 6 solutions.

So, that's 6 solutions so far.

Additionally, we have the solution where all three variables are 100, so that's 1 solution.

Are there any other solutions where none of the variables are zero?

Let me see. Let's suppose that all a, b, c are positive integers. Then, perhaps we can find other solutions.



---------------

Wait, let's consider another case where two variables are equal, but not all three. Let me try setting a = b, but not necessarily equal to c.



---------------

Wait, earlier, when I set a = b, the only solution was when a = b = c = 100. So, perhaps that's the only case when two variables are equal.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I can try setting a = 100, and see what happens.

Wait, but maybe I can consider that if a, b, c are all positive, perhaps the only solution is when they are all 100. Let's test that.

Suppose that a, b, c are all positive, and a + b + c = 300.

We have 100P - Q = 2,000,000.

But if a, b, c are all positive, then P is at least 3*(1)^2 = 3, but in our case, P must be at least 20,000.



---------------

Wait, but when a = b = c = 100, P = 30,000, which is the maximum possible. So, perhaps the only solution with all variables positive is when a = b = c = 100.



---------------

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose that a, b, c are all different. Could that satisfy the conditions?



---------------

Alternatively, maybe there are other solutions where two variables are 100 and the third is 100 as well, but that's the same as all three being 100.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the only possible solutions are the ones where one variable is zero and the other two are 200 and 100, and the case where all three are 100.

But let me check another case. Let's say that one variable is 150, another is 150, and the third is 0.



---------------

Wait, let's see: a = 150, b = 150, c = 0.

Then, a + b + c = 300, which is correct.

Compute the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

= 150²*150 + 150²*0 + 150²*150 + 150²*0 + 0²*150 + 0²*150.

= 2*(150^3) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2*(3,375,000) = 6,750,000.

Which is greater than 6,000,000, so that doesn't satisfy the condition.

Hmm, so that's not a solution.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe I can try a = 150, b = 100, c = 50.

Then, a + b + c = 300.

Compute the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

= 150²*100 + 150²*50 + 100²*150 + 100²*50 + 50²*150 + 50²*100.

Compute each term:

150² = 22,500.

22,500*100 = 2,250,000.

22,500*50 = 1,125,000.

100² = 10,000.

10,000*150 = 1,500,000.

10,000*50 = 500,000.

50² = 2,500.

2,500*150 = 375,000.

2,500*100 = 250,000.

Now, sum all these:

2,250,000 + 1,125,000 = 3,375,000.

3,375,000 + 1,500,000 = 4,875,000.

4,875,000 + 500,000 = 5,375,000.

5,375,000 + 375,000 = 5,750,000.

5,750,000 + 250,000 = 6,000,000.

Oh! So this triple (150, 100, 50) satisfies both conditions.



---------------

Wait, that's another solution. So, that suggests there are more solutions than just the ones with a zero and the symmetric one.



---------------

Wait, so this is a new case where none of the variables are zero, and they are all different.

Hmm, so maybe there are more solutions. Let me check.

So, in this case, a = 150, b = 100, c = 50.

Let me compute P and Q for this case.

P = ab + ac + bc = 150*100 + 150*50 + 100*50 = 15,000 + 7,500 + 5,000 = 27,500.

Q = abc = 150*100*50 = 750,000.

Now, check 100P - Q = 100*27,500 - 750,000 = 2,750,000 - 750,000 = 2,000,000. So, that works.

So, this is a valid solution. So, there are more solutions.



---------------

Wait, so perhaps there are multiple solutions where variables are different, not necessarily zero.

Hmm, so I need to find all such triples.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the solutions can be categorized into two types:

1. Triples where one variable is zero, and the other two are 200 and 100. As we saw earlier, these give 6 solutions.

2. Triples where all variables are positive and satisfy the conditions, such as (150, 100, 50) and its permutations.

So, perhaps I can find all such triples where variables are positive and find how many there are.



---------------

Wait, but how?

Let me think about the equation 100P - Q = 2,000,000, where P = ab + bc + ca and Q = abc.

Given that a + b + c = 300, and a, b, c are positive integers, perhaps I can find all possible triples (a, b, c) that satisfy these.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that in the case where all variables are positive, we can set up the problem in terms of variables x, y, z, but I'm not sure.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for a given P, Q is determined as 100P - 2,000,000. So, for each possible P, I can check if there exists a triple (a, b, c) with a + b + c = 300, ab + bc + ca = P, and abc = Q.

But that might be time-consuming.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that when a, b, c are all positive, the equation 100P - Q = 2,000,000 must hold, along with a + b + c = 300.

But maybe I can find another way.



---------------

Wait, let's consider that when a, b, c are positive integers, perhaps the variables can be expressed as multiples of 50, given that 150, 100, 50 are multiples of 50.



---------------

Wait, in the example I found, a = 150, b = 100, c = 50, which are multiples of 50.

Let me see if other such triples exist where a, b, c are multiples of 50.

Let me set a = 50k, b = 50m, c = 50n, where k, m, n are positive integers.

Then, a + b + c = 50(k + m + n) = 300 → k + m + n = 6.

So, the problem reduces to finding positive integers k, m, n such that k + m + n = 6, and:

100*(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

But substituting a = 50k, etc., we get:

ab = (50k)(50m) = 2500 km.

Similarly, bc = 2500 mn, ca = 2500 kn.

So, ab + bc + ca = 2500(km + mn + kn).

abc = (50k)(50m)(50n) = 125,000 kmn.

Now, substituting into 100P - Q = 2,000,000:

100*(2500(km + mn + kn)) - 125,000 kmn = 2,000,000.

Simplify:

250,000(km + mn + kn) - 125,000 kmn = 2,000,000.

Divide both sides by 25,000:

10(km + mn + kn) - 5 kmn = 80.

Simplify:

10(km + mn + kn) - 5 kmn = 80.

Let me factor out 5:

5[2(km + mn + kn) - kmn] = 80 → 2(km + mn + kn) - kmn = 16.

So, 2(km + mn + kn) - kmn = 16.

Now, since k, m, n are positive integers and k + m + n = 6, let me list all possible triples (k, m, n) where k ≤ m ≤ n and k + m + n = 6.

Possible triples:

1. (1, 1, 4)
2. (1, 2, 3)
3. (2, 2, 2)

Let me check each case.

Case 1: (1, 1, 4)

Compute 2(km + mn + kn) - kmn.

km = 1*1 = 1

mn = 1*4 = 4

kn = 1*4 = 4

Sum: 1 + 4 + 4 = 9

So, 2*9 = 18

kmn = 1*1*4 = 4

So, 18 - 4 = 14, which is less than 16. So, this doesn't satisfy the equation.

Case 2: (1, 2, 3)

Compute:

km = 1*2 = 2

mn = 2*3 = 6

kn = 1*3 = 3

Sum: 2 + 6 + 3 = 11

2*11 = 22

kmn = 1*2*3 = 6

22 - 6 = 16. That's exactly what we need.

So, this triple satisfies the equation.

Case 3: (2, 2, 2)

Compute:

km = 2*2 = 4

mn = 2*2 = 4

kn = 2*2 = 4

Sum: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12

2*12 = 24

kmn = 2*2*2 = 8

24 - 8 = 16. So, this also satisfies.

So, the triples (1,2,3) and (2,2,2) satisfy the condition.

Now, let's check what these correspond to in terms of a, b, c.

For (1,2,3):

k=1, m=2, n=3.

So, a = 50*1 = 50

b = 50*2 = 100

c = 50*3 = 150

Which is the solution we found earlier: (50, 100, 150). But since the variables are ordered, we can permute these.

Similarly, for (2,2,2):

k=m=n=2 → a = b = c = 100.

Which is the symmetric solution.

Now, let's see how many ordered triples correspond to each case.

First, the case (1,2,3):

The number of permutations is the number of distinct orderings of (1,2,3), which is 3! = 6.



---------------

But wait, since in the problem, a, b, c are ordered, each permutation would count as a distinct solution. So, (50, 100, 150), (50, 150, 100), (100, 50, 150), (100, 150, 50), (150, 50, 100), (150, 100, 50) are all distinct solutions.

Similarly, the case (2,2,2) corresponds to a single solution where all three are 100.

So, in the case where a, b, c are multiples of 50, we have 6 + 1 = 7 solutions. 

---------------

But wait, earlier when I considered the case where one variable is zero, I found 6 solutions, and now I have another 6 from the (1,2,3) case and 1 from (2,2,2). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.



---------------

Wait, no, in the case where a, b, c are multiples of 50 and positive, we have two types:

- The (1,2,3) case, which gives 6 ordered triples.

- The (2,2,2) case, which gives 1 ordered triple.

So, that's 7 solutions where a, b, c are positive and multiples of 50.

Additionally, we have the 6 solutions where one variable is zero, and the other two are 100 and 200.

So, total solutions so far are 6 (zero case) + 7 (positive multiples of 50) = 13.



---------------

But wait, I found a solution where a=150, b=100, c=50, which is part of the 6 permutations of (50,100,150). So, that's 6 solutions.

Plus the all-100s solution, which is 1.

Plus the 6 solutions where one variable is zero, the other two being 100 and 200.

So, total is 6 + 1 + 6 = 13 solutions.



---------------

Wait, but when I considered a=150, b=100, c=50, that's part of the (1,2,3) case, which gives 6 solutions.



---------------

Wait, but let me make sure that these are all the solutions.

Wait, perhaps I can check if there are any other solutions where a, b, c are not multiples of 50.



---------------

But wait, the approach where I set a = 50k, etc., might have limited the search to multiples of 50, but perhaps there are other solutions where the variables are not multiples of 50.



---------------

Wait, but in that case, when I set a = 50k, etc., I found that the equation reduces to 2(km + mn + kn) - kmn = 16, which only has solutions when k + m + n = 6 and k, m, n are positive integers.

And the only solutions in that case are (1,2,3) and (2,2,2), leading to the 7 solutions mentioned earlier.

But perhaps there are other solutions where a, b, c are not multiples of 50, but still satisfy the original equations.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps all solutions must have a, b, c as multiples of 50. Let me see.

Suppose that a, b, c are not multiples of 50, but their sum is 300, which is a multiple of 50. Let me see if that's possible.



---------------

Wait, for example, a=100, b=100, c=100: all multiples of 50.



---------------

Another example: a=200, b=100, c=0: 200 and 100 are multiples of 50, 0 is a multiple of 50.



---------------

Another example: a=150, b=100, c=50: all multiples of 50.

But could there be a solution where, say, a=175, b=100, c=25?

Let me check if that works.

Compute a + b + c = 175 + 100 + 25 = 300: correct.

Now, compute the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

= 175²*100 + 175²*25 + 100²*175 + 100²*25 + 25²*175 + 25²*100.

Compute each term:

175² = 30,625.

30,625*100 = 3,062,500.

30,625*25 = 765,625.

100² = 10,000.

10,000*175 = 1,750,000.

10,000*25 = 250,000.

25² = 625.

625*175 = 109,375.

625*100 = 62,500.

Now, sum all terms:

3,062,500 + 765,625 = 3,828,125.

+1,750,000 = 5,578,125.

+250,000 = 5,828,125.

+109,375 = 5,937,500.

+62,500 = 6,000,000.

So, this also works! So, (175, 100, 25) is another solution.



---------------

Wait, but 175 and 25 are not multiples of 50. Hmm, so my earlier assumption that all solutions are multiples of 50 was incorrect.

So, that suggests that there are more solutions beyond the ones I found by setting a = 50k, etc.

Hmm, so perhaps my approach was too restrictive. I need another way to find all possible solutions.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I can consider that a, b, c are such that 50 divides a, b, c, but that's not necessarily the case, as shown by the example (175, 100, 25).



---------------

Wait, let me check if 175, 100, 25 can be expressed as 50k, 50m, 50n where k, m, n are integers.

175 = 50*3.5 → which is not an integer, so no. So, that's why the earlier approach missed this solution.

So, perhaps I need a different strategy.

Let me try to think differently.

We have a + b + c = 300 and 100P - Q = 2,000,000, where P = ab + bc + ca and Q = abc.

We can consider that for positive integers a, b, c, the equation 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000 must hold.

Let me write this as abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this equation.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe I can add 100^3 to both sides to make it factorable.

Wait, let me try adding 100^3 to both sides:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) + 100^3 = -2,000,000 + 100^3.

Compute RHS: 100^3 = 1,000,000.

So, -2,000,000 + 1,000,000 = -1,000,000.

So, now the equation is:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) + 100^3 = -1,000,000.

Hmm, can I factor the left side?

Let me see: abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) + 100^3.

Hmm, perhaps factor as (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100).

Let me compute (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100):

= abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) + 100^2(a + b + c) - 100^3.



---------------

Wait, that's different from what I have. Let me compute:

(a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) = abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) + 100^2(a + b + c) - 100^3.

But in our equation, we have abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) + 100^3 = -1,000,000.

Comparing, the difference is that in our case, the term 100^2(a + b + c) is present in the expanded form but not in our equation.

So, perhaps I can adjust for that.

Let me compute:

(a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) = abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) + 100^2(a + b + c) - 100^3.

We know that a + b + c = 300, so 100^2*300 = 100^2*300 = 100*100*300 = 3,000,000.

So, substituting:

(a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) = abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000.

Which simplifies to:

= (abc - 100(ab + bc + ca)) + 2,000,000.

But from our earlier equation, abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000.

So,

(a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) = (-2,000,000) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Therefore,

(a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) = 0.

Which implies that at least one of (a - 100), (b - 100), or (c - 100) must be zero. So, at least one of a, b, c must be 100.

Ah, that's a crucial insight!

So, this tells me that in any solution where a, b, c are positive integers, at least one of them must be equal to 100.

So, that greatly simplifies the problem.

Therefore, all solutions must have at least one variable equal to 100.

So, let's consider the cases where one of a, b, or c is 100.

Case 1: a = 100.

Then, the equation becomes:

100 + b + c = 300 → b + c = 200.

And the second equation becomes:

100²b + 100²c + b²*100 + b²c + c²*100 + c²b = 6,000,000.



---------------

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to use the earlier equation.

Since a = 100, let's compute P and Q.

P = ab + ac + bc = 100b + 100c + bc.

Q = abc = 100bc.

From 100P - Q = 2,000,000:

100*(100b + 100c + bc) - 100bc = 2,000,000.

Simplify:

100*(100b + 100c + bc - bc) = 2,000,000.



---------------

Wait, because the last term is -100bc, which is subtracted.

Wait, wait, let me compute correctly:

100P - Q = 100*(100b + 100c + bc) - 100bc.

= 100*100b + 100*100c + 100*bc - 100bc.

= 10,000b + 10,000c + 100bc - 100bc.

= 10,000b + 10,000c.

So, 10,000b + 10,000c = 2,000,000.

Divide both sides by 10,000:

b + c = 200.

Which we already knew, since a = 100 and a + b + c = 300.

So, this doesn't give us new information. Hmm.



---------------

But wait, perhaps using the second equation in terms of a, b, c.

Wait, when a = 100, the second equation is:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Substituting a = 100:

100²b + 100²c + b²*100 + b²c + c²*100 + c²b.

= 10,000b + 10,000c + 100b² + b²c + 100c² + c²b.

Hmm, perhaps we can factor this expression.

Let me factor terms:

= 100b² + 100c² + (10,000b + 10,000c) + (b²c + c²b).

Factor b²c + c²b = bc(b + c).

And since b + c = 200, this becomes bc*200.

So, putting it all together:

= 100b² + 100c² + 10,000*(b + c) + 200bc.

= 100(b² + c²) + 10,000*200 + 200bc.



---------------

Wait, because b + c = 200, so 10,000*(b + c) = 10,000*200 = 2,000,000.

So, the equation becomes:

100(b² + c²) + 2,000,000 + 200bc = 6,000,000.

Subtract 2,000,000:

100(b² + c²) + 200bc = 4,000,000.

Divide both sides by 100:

b² + c² + 2bc = 40,000.

Note that b² + c² + 2bc = (b + c)^2.

Since b + c = 200, (b + c)^2 = 200² = 40,000.

So, this equation is satisfied for any b and c such that b + c = 200.

So, that means that whenever a = 100, and b + c = 200, the second equation is automatically satisfied.

Therefore, any triple where a = 100 and b + c = 200 will satisfy both equations.

Similarly, if b = 100 or c = 100, the same logic applies.

So, this suggests that all solutions must have at least one variable equal to 100.

Therefore, the total number of solutions is the number of triples where at least one of a, b, c is 100, and the other two sum to 200.



---------------

But wait, we also have the case where one of the variables is zero, and the other two are 100 and 200, which also satisfies the conditions.

So, let me structure the solutions into two categories:

1. Exactly one variable is 100, and the other two are positive integers summing to 200.

2. One variable is zero, another is 100, and the third is 200.



---------------

Wait, but in the second case, the variables are (100, 200, 0), which is a case where one variable is 100, another is 200, and the third is zero.

So, perhaps these are all covered in the case where one variable is 100, and the other two sum to 200, including the possibility of one of them being zero.



---------------

Wait, but in the earlier example where a=175, b=100, c=25, that's a case where a=175, which is not 100, but b=100. So, it's included in the first category.

So, let's compute the number of solutions in each case.

Case 1: Exactly one variable is 100, and the other two are positive integers summing to 200.

The number of such triples is equal to the number of ways to assign which variable is 100 (3 choices: a, b, or c), multiplied by the number of ordered pairs (x, y) where x + y = 200 and x, y are positive integers.

The number of ordered pairs (x, y) where x + y = 200 and x, y ≥ 1 is 199. Because x can range from 1 to 199, and y = 200 - x.

So, for each choice of which variable is 100, there are 199 possible ordered pairs for the other two variables.



---------------

But wait, this would suggest 3 * 199 = 597 solutions, but that can't be right because when x and y are swapped, they are considered different ordered pairs.



---------------

Wait, but in our problem, the variables are ordered triples, so each permutation counts separately.

Wait, but in our problem, when a variable is fixed as 100, the other two variables can be any positive integers summing to 200, and each permutation is a distinct solution.

So, for each of the 3 choices (a=100, b=100, c=100), the number of ordered pairs is 199. So, total solutions in this case would be 3 * 199 = 597.



---------------

But wait, this would include cases where two variables are 100, but that's not possible because a + b + c would then be 100 + 100 + c = 200 + c = 300 → c = 100. So, when two variables are 100, the third must also be 100, which is the all-100s solution, which is already counted when a=100, b=100, c=100. But in our earlier count, when a=100, we're considering the other two variables to sum to 200, which includes the case where they are both 100. So, the all-100s solution is included in each of the 3 cases where a=100, etc.



---------------

Wait, but this would mean that the all-100s solution is being counted three times in the 597 total, but it's actually a single solution where all three are 100. So, we need to adjust for that overcounting.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that when exactly one variable is 100, the other two are distinct and sum to 200, and when two variables are 100, the third is also 100.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the number of solutions where exactly one variable is 100, and the other two are positive integers summing to 200, and then add the solution where all three are 100.



---------------

Wait, but the all-100s solution is already included in each of the three cases where a=100, etc. So, perhaps the total number of solutions where at least one variable is 100 is 3*199 - 2*1 + 1, but I'm getting confused.



---------------

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the number of solutions where exactly one variable is 100, and the other two are positive and distinct, plus the number of solutions where exactly two variables are 100, and the third is 100, which is just the all-100s solution.



---------------

Wait, but if two variables are 100, then the third must be 100 as well because a + b + c = 300. So, the only solution where two variables are 100 is when all three are 100.

So, the number of solutions where exactly one variable is 100 is 3*(number of ordered pairs (x, y) where x + y = 200 and x ≠ 100, y ≠ 100). 

---------------

But wait, no, because when x or y is 100, the other is 100 as well.



---------------

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it as follows:

The number of ordered triples where exactly one variable is 100 is 3*(number of ordered pairs (x, y) where x + y = 200 and x ≠ 100, y ≠ 100).



---------------

But wait, when x + y = 200, and neither x nor y is 100, then the number of such ordered pairs is 199 - 2 = 197, because when x=100, y=100 is the only case where x or y is 100. 

---------------

But wait, no, because x and y can be 100 independently.

Wait, no, because if x=100, then y=100. So, in the ordered pairs where x + y = 200, only one pair has x=100 and y=100. All others have x ≠ 100 and y ≠ 100.



---------------

Wait, but in the ordered pairs, (100,100) is the only pair where x=100 or y=100. So, the number of ordered pairs where x + y = 200 and x ≠ 100 and y ≠ 100 is 199 - 1 = 198.

So, the number of solutions where exactly one variable is 100 is 3*198 = 594.

Plus the solution where all three are 100, which is 1.

So, total solutions where at least one variable is 100 is 594 + 1 = 595.

Additionally, we have the solutions where one variable is zero, another is 100, and the third is 200.



---------------

Wait, but in those cases, the variable that is 100 is already counted in the above cases. So, perhaps I need to separate the cases where variables are zero.



---------------

Wait, but earlier, when I considered the case where a variable is zero, like c=0, then a + b = 300, and ab = 20,000, leading to solutions where the other two variables are 200 and 100. But in those cases, one of the variables is 100, so they are included in the 595 solutions where at least one variable is 100.



---------------

Wait, but when c=0, a and b are 200 and 100, so that's a solution where two variables are 200 and 100, and the third is zero. But in this case, the variable 100 is included, so it's already part of the 595 solutions.



---------------

Wait, but earlier when I considered the case where a=100, the other two variables could be any positive integers summing to 200, including cases where one is zero. 

---------------

Wait, no, because in that case, when a=100, and c=0, then b=200. So, that's included in the 199 ordered pairs for a=100.

So, perhaps the 595 solutions already include all cases where at least one variable is 100, whether or not another variable is zero.



---------------

Wait, but in the earlier example where a=175, b=100, c=25, that's included in the 595 solutions as a case where b=100, and a and c sum to 200.

Similarly, the case where a=200, b=100, c=0 is included as a case where a=200 and c=0, with b=100.

So, perhaps the 595 solutions include all possible cases where at least one variable is 100, whether the other variables are positive or zero.



---------------

Wait, but in the case where a=100, the other two variables can be any positive integers summing to 200, including cases where one is zero. So, for example, when a=100, and c=0, then b=200.

So, in that case, the solution (100, 200, 0) is included in the 595 solutions.

Similarly, all other cases where one variable is 100 and another is zero are included.

So, perhaps the total number of solutions is 595.



---------------

Wait, but earlier I found 6 solutions where one variable is zero, and the other two are 100 and 200. So, those 6 solutions are included in the 595.

Additionally, the solution where all three are 100 is included once.

And the other solutions where one variable is 100, and the other two are positive and sum to 200, but not including zero, are included in the 595.

So, perhaps the total number of solutions is 595.



---------------

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The 595 solutions include all ordered triples where at least one variable is 100, regardless of the other variables. So, that includes:

- The all-100s solution: 1.

- The 6 solutions where one variable is zero, another is 100, and the third is 200.

- The other solutions where one variable is 100, and the other two are positive and sum to 200.

So, the total is 595.

But earlier, when I thought about the example where a=175, b=100, c=25, that's included in the 595.

So, perhaps the answer is 595.



---------------

Wait, but let me verify that.

Wait, the number of solutions where at least one variable is 100 is 3*(number of ordered pairs (x, y) where x + y = 200) = 3*199 = 597.

But this counts the all-100s solution three times (once for each variable being 100), so we need to subtract the overcounts.

The all-100s solution is counted three times, but it should be counted once. So, we subtract 2.

So, total solutions would be 597 - 2 = 595.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, the total number of solutions is 595.



---------------

Wait, but earlier when I considered the case where one variable is zero, I found 6 solutions, which are included in the 595.

And the all-100s solution is also included.

So, that seems correct.



---------------

Wait, but let me think about the example I had earlier where a=175, b=100, c=25. That's a valid solution and is included in the 595.

Similarly, the solution (100, 200, 0) is included as one of the 595.

So, I think the total number of solutions is 595.



---------------

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought that the case where a=100, b=200, c=0 is included, and there are 6 such solutions (permutations of (100, 200, 0)), which are all included in the 595.

So, perhaps the answer is 595.



---------------

Wait, but let me think again. Each of the 3 choices (a=100, b=100, c=100) has 199 solutions, which includes the cases where the other two variables are zero or positive.

But when a=100, and c=0, then b=200, which is a valid solution.

Similarly, when a=100, and b=0, then c=200.

So, each of these zero cases is included in the 199 solutions for each choice of a=100, etc.

So, the 595 includes all possible cases where at least one variable is 100, including those where another variable is zero.

Thus, the total number of solutions is 595.



---------------

Wait, but let me confirm that.

Wait, 3 choices for which variable is 100, each with 199 ordered pairs for the other two variables summing to 200.

But when two variables are 100, the third must be 100, so that's the all-100s solution, which is counted three times in the 3*199.

So, the total number of distinct solutions is 3*199 - 2*1 = 597 - 2 = 595.

Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the total number of ordered triples (a, b, c) satisfying the conditions is 595.



---------------

Wait, but earlier when I considered the case where a=100, and the other two variables sum to 200, I thought that would give 199 solutions per choice, but that includes the all-100s solution.



---------------

Wait, but in the problem, the variables are ordered triples, so (100, 200, 0) is different from (200, 100, 0), etc.

So, the 595 solutions include all possible permutations.

Therefore, the final answer is 595.


The number of triples is 595.

$\boxed{595}$
