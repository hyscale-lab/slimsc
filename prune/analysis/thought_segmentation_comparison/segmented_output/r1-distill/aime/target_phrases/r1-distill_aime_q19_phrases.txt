Okay, so I've got this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to understand it step by step. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but they're indistinguishable except for their color. I need to figure out how many ways there are to place some of these chips in the grid under certain conditions.

The conditions are:

1. Each cell can have at most one chip.
2. All chips in the same row must be the same color.
3. All chips in the same column must be the same color.
4. Any additional chip placed would violate one or more of the previous conditions.

Hmm. So, let me break this down. First, each row must have chips of the same color. So, for each row, I can choose either white or black, but once I choose a color for a row, all the chips in that row must be that color. Similarly, each column must also have chips of the same color. So, for each column, I choose a color, and all chips in that column must be that color.



---------------

Wait, but if each row has a single color and each column has a single color, how do these interact? Because a cell is at the intersection of a row and a column. So, the color of the cell must satisfy both the row's color and the column's color. That means that if a row is white and a column is black, their intersection can't have a chip because it would have to be both white and black, which is impossible. So, for a cell to have a chip, the row and column it's in must have the same color.

Therefore, the grid can only have chips where the corresponding row and column colors agree. So, the grid must be such that all the rows and columns with white chips form a sort of rectangle (or union of rectangles), and similarly for black chips. But since the grid is 5x5, it's a single rectangle if all the white rows and columns are chosen together.



---------------

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because if I choose some rows and columns to be white, their intersection is where the white chips go, but the other cells in those rows and columns must also be white or black according to their respective row or column.



---------------

Wait, maybe it's better to model this as a matrix where each row is assigned a color, each column is assigned a color, and then the cell is assigned a chip if the row and column colors match. So, the placement is determined by the row and column color assignments, with the condition that if a row is white, all chips in that row must be white, and same for the columns.

But then, the problem says that after placing the chips, any additional chip would violate the conditions. That suggests that the current placement is maximal; you can't add any more chips without breaking the row or column color uniformity.

So, the grid must be such that every cell that is not yet occupied is such that either its row is already assigned a color different from the column, or adding a chip there would require changing the color of its row or column, which isn't allowed because the conditions must hold.



---------------

Wait, but if a cell is empty, that could be because either the row is white and the column is black, or vice versa. Because if the row and column are both white, the cell should have a white chip. So, in other words, every empty cell must lie in a row and column of different colors.

So, the grid must be such that every cell that's empty is in a row and column of different colors. So, the occupied cells are exactly where the row and column colors agree.

So, the problem reduces to assigning each row and column a color (white or black), such that the number of white chips is less than or equal to 25, and similarly for black chips. But since we have 25 white and 25 black chips, the total number of chips placed is the sum of white and black, which would be 25 each? 

---------------

Wait, no, because each cell can have at most one chip, so the total number of chips is the number of cells where row and column colors agree.



---------------

Wait, let me think again. Each row is either white or black. Each column is either white or black. Then, the number of white chips is the number of cells where the row is white and the column is white. Similarly, the number of black chips is the number of cells where the row is black and the column is black.

So, if I let R be the set of white rows and C be the set of white columns, then the number of white chips is |R ∩ C|? 

---------------

Wait, no. Wait, the number of white chips would be the number of cells where both the row and column are white. So, that's |R| * |C|? No, because each cell is in one row and one column. So, if R is the number of white rows and C is the number of white columns, then the number of white chips is R*C. Similarly, the number of black chips would be (5 - R)*(5 - C), because the remaining rows are black, and the remaining columns are black.



---------------

Wait, that might make sense. Let me test with an example. Suppose R=3, C=2. Then white chips are 3*2=6, and black chips are (5-3)*(5-2)=2*3=6. So total chips would be 12. But the problem allows up to 25 white and 25 black, but in this case, it's 6 each. So, that doesn't add up. 

---------------

Wait, maybe I'm modeling this incorrectly.

Alternatively, perhaps R is the set of rows colored white, and C is the set of columns colored white. Then, the number of white chips is |R| * |C|, and the number of black chips is (5 - |R|) * (5 - |C|). So, if |R| is the number of white rows, and |C| is the number of white columns.



---------------

But wait, the total number of white and black chips must not exceed 25 each. So, |R|*|C| ≤ 25 and (5 - |R|)*(5 - |C|) ≤25.



---------------

Wait, but in the example where |R|=3 and |C|=2, |R|*|C|=6 and (5-3)*(5-2)=2*3=6. So, each is 6, which is under 25. So, that's acceptable.

But the problem allows up to 25 white and 25 black. So, |R|*|C| can be up to 25, and (5 - |R|)*(5 - |C|) can also be up to 25.



---------------

Wait, but in the case where |R|=5 and |C|=5, then the number of white chips is 25, and the black chips are 0. That's allowed. Similarly, if |R|=0 and |C|=0, then all cells are black, which is allowed.

But the problem states that the placement is maximal; you can't add any more chips without violating the conditions. So, in this case, that means that for every empty cell, either the row is white and the column is black, or the row is black and the column is white. Because if a cell is empty, it's because the row and column have different colors. So, the placement is such that the grid is as filled as possible, given the row and column color assignments.

So, the number of white chips is |R|*|C|, and the number of black chips is (5 - |R|)*(5 - |C|). But since we have 25 white and 25 black chips, we must have |R|*|C| + (5 - |R|)*(5 - |C|) = 50.



---------------

Wait, but |R|*|C| + (5 - |R|)*(5 - |C|) = 25. Because the grid has 25 cells. So, each cell is either white or black, but in our case, the white and black regions are determined by the row and column color assignments.



---------------

Wait, no. Wait, each cell is either white or black, but the number of white cells is |R|*|C|, and the number of black cells is (5 - |R|)*(5 - |C|). So, |R|*|C| + (5 - |R|)*(5 - |C|) = 25. So, that's always true because R and C are subsets of the rows and columns.



---------------

Wait, but in our problem, the total number of chips is |R|*|C| + (5 - |R|)*(5 - |C|) = 25, which is always the case, but we have 25 white and 25 black chips. 

---------------

Wait, no, because we have 25 white and 25 black chips available, but we don't necessarily have to use all of them.



---------------

Wait, the problem says "some of these chips". So, we can use any number of chips as long as we don't exceed 25 white or 25 black. So, the number of white chips is |R|*|C|, which must be ≤25, and the number of black chips is (5 - |R|)*(5 - |C|) ≤25.

But in the maximal case, we can't add any more chips. So, that implies that for any empty cell, adding a chip would require that row and column to have the same color, which they don't. So, every empty cell is in a row and column of different colors.

Therefore, the grid must be such that the white and black regions form a sort of bipartition where white and black regions are determined by the row and column colorings, and the intersection of white rows and black columns, and black rows and white columns are empty.

So, the question is to count the number of such assignments where:

1. For each row, assign white or black.
2. For each column, assign white or black.
3. The number of white chips (|R|*|C|) ≤25.
4. The number of black chips ((5 - |R|)*(5 - |C|)) ≤25.
5. The assignment is such that the placement is maximal, meaning you can't add any more chips without violating the conditions.



---------------

But wait, since the grid is 5x5, the total number of chips is |R|*|C| + (5 - |R|)*(5 - |C|) = 25. So, the total is fixed at 25, but the problem allows up to 25 white and 25 black. So, in our case, the total is 25, which is less than or equal to 25 for each color. So, the constraints are automatically satisfied as long as |R|*|C| ≤25 and (5 - |R|)*(5 - |C|) ≤25.

But since |R| and |C| are numbers of rows and columns, they can range from 0 to 5. So, we need to find all possible pairs (r, c) where r is the number of white rows, c is the number of white columns, such that r*c ≤25 and (5 - r)*(5 - c) ≤25.



---------------

But wait, since r and c are between 0 and 5, let's compute r*c and (5 - r)*(5 - c) for all possible (r, c):

Let me list all possible (r, c) pairs from (0,0) to (5,5):

For (0,0):
r*c = 0, (5-0)*(5-0)=25 → 25 ≤25. So, valid.

For (0,1):
0*1=0, 5*4=20 ≤25. Valid.

Similarly, all (0, c) where c from 0 to5:
r=0, c: 0-5. r*c=0, (5-0)*(5-c)=5*(5 -c). Since 5 -c is 5 down to 0, so 5*(5-c) is 25, 20, 15, 10,5,0. All ≤25. So, all valid.

Similarly, for r=1, c from0-5:

r=1, c=0: 0, (4)*5=20 ≤25. Valid.
r=1, c=1: 1, 4*4=16 ≤25.
...
r=1, c=5: 5, 4*0=0. Both ≤25.

Similarly, for r=2, c=0-5:
r=2, c=0: 0, 3*5=15 ≤25.
r=2, c=1: 2, 3*4=12 ≤25.
r=2, c=2:4, 3*3=9 ≤25.
r=2, c=3:6, 3*2=6 ≤25.
r=2, c=4:8, 3*1=3 ≤25.
r=2, c=5:10, 3*0=0 ≤25.

Similarly, for r=3:

r=3, c=0: 0, 2*5=10 ≤25.
r=3, c=1:3, 2*4=8 ≤25.
r=3, c=2:6, 2*3=6 ≤25.
r=3, c=3:9, 2*2=4 ≤25.
r=3, c=4:12, 2*1=2 ≤25.
r=3, c=5:15, 2*0=0 ≤25.

For r=4:

r=4, c=0:0,1*5=5 ≤25.
r=4, c=1:4,1*4=4 ≤25.
r=4, c=2:8,1*3=3 ≤25.
r=4, c=3:12,1*2=2 ≤25.
r=4, c=4:16,1*1=1 ≤25.
r=4, c=5:20,1*0=0 ≤25.

For r=5:

r=5, c=0:0,0*5=0 ≤25.
r=5, c=1:5,0*4=0 ≤25.
r=5, c=2:10,0*3=0 ≤25.
r=5, c=3:15,0*2=0 ≤25.
r=5, c=4:20,0*1=0 ≤25.
r=5, c=5:25,0*0=0 ≤25.

So, all possible (r, c) pairs satisfy the constraints. Therefore, for each possible (r, c), we can compute the number of ways to choose r white rows, c white columns, and then the number of white chips is r*c, and black chips is (5 - r)*(5 - c).



---------------

But wait, the problem says "some of these chips", meaning we can use any number up to 25 each, but in our case, the total is 25, which is within the limit. So, all possible (r, c) are valid.

Now, for each (r, c), the number of ways to choose r white rows is C(5, r), and the number of ways to choose c white columns is C(5, c). However, we have to consider that the placement is maximal, meaning that you can't add any more chips. So, the color assignments must be such that every empty cell is in a row and column of different colors.



---------------

Wait, but if we choose any r and c, and assign the rows and columns accordingly, then the grid will automatically be maximal because any empty cell is in a row and column of different colors, so you can't add a chip there without violating the color conditions.

So, the total number of such colorings is the sum over all possible r and c of [C(5, r) * C(5, c)]. 

---------------

But wait, no, because for each (r, c), the number of ways is C(5, r) * C(5, c). But we have to make sure that the white and black regions don't overlap in a way that allows adding more chips. But as we discussed earlier, any such assignment is maximal because all empty cells are in conflicting rows and columns.



---------------

Wait, but let's think about this. Suppose I choose r=3, c=2. Then, the white chips are in the 3x2=6 cells where the white rows and white columns intersect. The black chips are in the (5-3)x(5-2)=2x3=6 cells where the black rows and black columns intersect. The remaining cells (which are 5x5 - 6 -6=13 cells) are empty because they are in rows and columns of different colors. So, in this case, the placement is maximal because you can't add any more chips without changing the row or column colors.

So, each possible (r, c) pair corresponds to a valid maximal placement. Therefore, the total number of ways is the sum over all possible r and c of [C(5, r) * C(5, c)].



---------------

But wait, let's compute this. The total would be sum_{r=0 to5} sum_{c=0 to5} C(5, r) * C(5, c). But that's equal to [sum_{r=0 to5} C(5, r)]^2 = (2^5)^2 = 1024. But that can't be right because the problem says "some of these chips", but we're counting all possible assignments, including those that don't use all 25 cells.



---------------

Wait, but the problem doesn't require using all 25 cells, just that the placement is maximal. So, the total number of such assignments is indeed 1024. 

---------------

But wait, the problem also says that each cell can have at most one chip, which is already satisfied.

Wait, but the problem says that any additional chip would violate the conditions. So, our reasoning that each (r, c) assignment is maximal is correct, so the total number of such assignments is 1024. 

---------------

But wait, that seems too high because the answer is supposed to be an integer, but 1024 is 2^10, which is plausible, but let's check.



---------------

Wait, but wait a second. When r=0, c=0: all cells are black. Similarly, r=5, c=5: all cells are white. These are valid assignments. But the problem says "some of these chips", so it's possible to have all cells empty? No, because the problem says "place some of these chips", which implies at least one chip. 

---------------

Wait, but in the case where r=0 and c=0, all cells are black, so all 25 cells have black chips. 

---------------

Wait, no, because r=0 means no white rows, so all rows are black. c=0 means no white columns, so all columns are black. So, the white chips are 0*0=0, and black chips are 5*5=25. So, all cells have black chips. Similarly, r=5, c=5: all cells have white chips.

But the problem says "some of these chips", so it's possible to have all 25 chips placed, as long as they meet the conditions. So, the total number of possible assignments is indeed 1024, but let's think again.



---------------

Wait, but the problem says "some of these chips", so it's possible to have any number from 0 to 25 chips, as long as the conditions are met. But in our earlier analysis, each (r, c) pair corresponds to a unique assignment where the white and black regions are determined by the row and column colorings. So, the total number of such assignments is 1024.



---------------

But wait, the problem says "the number of ways to place some of these chips...". So, perhaps the answer is 1024. But let me think again.



---------------

Wait, but in the problem statement, the chips are placed in the grid, with each cell having at most one chip. So, the total number of chips placed is |R|*|C| + (5 - |R|)*(5 - |C|) =25, as we saw earlier. So, in each assignment, exactly 25 chips are placed, either some white and some black, or all white or all black.

But the problem says "some of these chips", which could include any number from 0 to 25. 

---------------

Wait, but in our earlier reasoning, each (r, c) pair corresponds to exactly 25 chips placed. So, perhaps the problem is that each assignment corresponds to placing exactly 25 chips, but the problem allows for placing any number up to 25. So, perhaps we're missing something.



---------------

Wait, no. Because if you choose r=0, c=0, then all 25 cells have black chips. Similarly, r=5, c=5 gives all white. But for other (r, c), you have a mix. So, the total number of chips placed is always 25, which is the maximum. So, the problem says "some of these chips", but in reality, each assignment uses exactly 25 chips, which is the maximum possible. So, the problem's condition that any additional chip would violate the conditions is automatically satisfied because the grid is full.



---------------

Wait, but that can't be right because in our earlier example with r=3, c=2, the number of chips is 6 + 6=12, which is less than 25. 

---------------

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, because |R|*|C| + (5 - |R|)*(5 - |C|) =25. So, in all cases, the total number of chips is 25. So, the grid is always completely filled, but with a certain pattern of white and black chips.



---------------

Wait, that makes sense. Because each cell is either in a white row and white column (white chip), or in a black row and black column (black chip), or in conflicting rows and columns (empty). 

---------------

But wait, no, because if a cell is in a white row and black column, it's empty. Similarly, black row and white column, empty. So, the total number of chips is |R|*|C| + (5 - |R|)*(5 - |C|), which equals 25. So, the grid is always completely filled, but the chips are either white or black based on their row and column colors.

So, the problem is equivalent to assigning colors to each row and column, such that the grid is filled with white and black chips where the row and column colors agree. Each such assignment corresponds to a unique way of placing the chips.

Therefore, the number of ways is the number of possible assignments of row colors and column colors. Each row can be white or black, independently, and each column can be white or black, independently. So, there are 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024 possible assignments.



---------------

But wait, the problem says "some of these chips", but in our analysis, each assignment uses exactly 25 chips. So, perhaps the answer is 1024. But let's think again.



---------------

Wait, but the problem says that any additional chip placed would violate the conditions. So, in our assignments, the grid is already completely filled with 25 chips, so you can't add any more. So, each assignment is maximal. Therefore, the number of such assignments is 1024.



---------------

But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Is there any overcounting?

Wait, because if we have row colorings and column colorings, but perhaps some assignments lead to the same chip placement. For example, flipping all row colors and column colors would result in the same grid but swapping white and black. So, are these considered different?

Yes, because the problem distinguishes between white and black chips. So, if you swap all row and column colors, the white and black regions swap, leading to a different placement. So, these are different assignments.



---------------

Wait, but in our count, each assignment is unique because it's determined by the row and column colorings. So, the total is indeed 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024.



---------------

But wait, the problem says "some of these chips", which could mean that the grid doesn't have to be completely filled. But as we saw earlier, each assignment fills the grid completely, because |R|*|C| + (5 - |R|)*(5 - |C|) =25. So, the grid is always full.



---------------

Wait, but the problem says "some of these chips", which implies that the number of chips placed can vary. But in our model, it's fixed at 25. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.



---------------

Wait, let me read the problem again:

"Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the 25 unit cells of a 5×5 grid such that:

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions."

So, the placement must be such that it's maximal: you can't add any more chips without violating the conditions. So, the grid must be in a state where every empty cell is in a row and column of different colors, meaning that the grid is as filled as possible given the row and column color assignments.

But in our earlier model, each (r, c) assignment leads to a grid where exactly |R|*|C| + (5 - |R|)*(5 - |C|) =25 chips are placed. So, the grid is full. Therefore, the problem's condition is satisfied.

But then, the number of such assignments is 1024. But I have a feeling that this might not be correct because the problem seems to imply that the number is something else.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I'm overcounting. Because when you assign colors to rows and columns, some assignments lead to the same grid but with white and black swapped. But the problem counts these as different because the chips are colored. So, each assignment is unique.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the grid as a whole, so that if you have the same pattern but with colors swapped, it's considered a different way. So, 1024 is the correct count.



---------------

But wait, let me think differently. Suppose that for each cell, the color is determined by the row and column. So, for each cell (i,j), its color is white if row i is white and column j is white, or black if row i is black and column j is black. Otherwise, the cell is empty.

But the problem says that each cell can have at most one chip, and the grid must be maximal. So, each such assignment corresponds to a unique grid configuration.

But perhaps the answer is 1024, but I'm not sure. Let me think of a smaller case to verify.

Let's take a 1x1 grid. Then, the number of ways would be 2 (white or black) plus the case where no chips are placed. 

---------------

Wait, no, because the problem says "some of these chips", which could include placing zero chips. But in the 1x1 case:

- Place a white chip: 1 way.
- Place a black chip: 1 way.
- Place no chips: 1 way.

But according to our earlier model, the number of assignments would be 2^1 * 2^1 =4. But in reality, the valid maximal placements are:

- All cells (just one) are white: 1 way.
- All cells are black:1 way.
- No chips placed:1 way.



---------------

Wait, but according to our earlier model, for a 1x1 grid, r and c can be 0 or 1.

So, possible (r, c) pairs:

(0,0): white chips=0, black chips=1*1=1. So, the grid has one black chip. But the condition is that any additional chip would violate the conditions. But in this case, the grid has one cell, which is filled with a black chip. So, you can't add any more chips. So, this is valid.

Similarly, (0,1): white chips=0*1=0, black chips=(1-0)*(1-1)=1*0=0. So, the grid has zero chips. But the condition is that any additional chip would violate the conditions. But in this case, you can add a black chip, but that would require the row and column to be black, which they are (since r=0, c=1). 

---------------

Wait, no, because r=0 means the row is black, c=1 means the column is white. So, the cell is in a black row and white column, so it's empty. So, you can add a chip there, but it would have to be both black (row) and white (column), which is impossible. So, you can't add any chips. So, this is a valid maximal placement.



---------------

Wait, but in this case, the grid is empty. So, the number of chips placed is zero. But according to our earlier model, (0,1) would give white chips=0 and black chips=0, so total chips=0. So, it's a valid assignment.

Similarly, (1,0): white chips=1*0=0, black chips=0*1=0. So, grid is empty. So, this is another valid assignment.

(1,1): white chips=1*1=1, black chips=0*0=0. So, grid has one white chip. Maximal.

So, for 1x1 grid, the number of valid assignments is 4, which matches 2^(1+1)=4.

But according to the problem's conditions, the answer would be 4, which includes the case where no chips are placed. But the problem says "some of these chips", which might imply that at least one chip is placed. So, in the 1x1 case, the answer would be 3: all white, all black, or no chips. But according to the problem's statement, the last condition requires that any additional chip would violate the conditions. So, in the case where no chips are placed, you can add any chip, but that would require that the row and column have the same color, which they can be set to. So, the no-chip case is not maximal because you can add a chip by setting the row and column to white or black.



---------------

Wait, but in the no-chip case, the row and column are not yet assigned any color. Or are they?



---------------

Wait, no. Because in our model, each row and column must be assigned a color. So, in the no-chip case, the row and column are assigned different colors, leading to the cell being empty. So, you can't add a chip because the row and column are different. So, the no-chip case is a valid maximal placement.



---------------

Wait, but in the 1x1 case, if the row is black and the column is white, the cell is empty, and you can't add a chip because it would require the row and column to have the same color. So, the no-chip case is valid.

But according to the problem's statement, the answer for 1x1 would be 4, which includes all possible assignments. So, perhaps the answer for the 5x5 grid is indeed 1024.



---------------

But wait, let me think again. The problem says "some of these chips", which might imply that at least one chip is placed. But in our model, the no-chip case is allowed because it's maximal. So, perhaps the answer is 1024.

But I'm a bit unsure. Let me think of another small case, say 2x2 grid.

For a 2x2 grid, the number of assignments would be 2^2 * 2^2 =16.

But let's see:

Each assignment is determined by row colors (r1, r2) and column colors (c1, c2).

Each cell (i,j) is white if ri=white and cj=white, else black if ri=black and cj=black, else empty.

But the total number of chips is |R|*|C| + (2 - |R|)*(2 - |C|), which is 4 for any (r, c). So, the grid is always full.



---------------

Wait, no. Wait, for example, if r=1, c=1. Then, white chips=1*1=1, black chips=(2-1)*(2-1)=1. So, total chips=2. So, the grid is not full. 

---------------

Wait, but 1+1=2, which is less than 4. So, the grid isn't full. So, our earlier conclusion that the grid is always full is incorrect.



---------------

Wait, so in the 2x2 case, the number of chips is |R|*|C| + (2 - |R|)*(2 - |C|). For r=1, c=1, that's 1 +1=2. So, the grid has 2 chips. So, it's not full.

So, in this case, the grid isn't full, but the placement is maximal because any empty cell is in a row and column of different colors. So, you can't add any more chips.

So, the number of such assignments is indeed 16 for the 2x2 grid.

But the problem's answer for 5x5 would then be 1024.



---------------

But wait, let me confirm with r=1, c=1 in 2x2. The grid would have 1 white chip and 1 black chip. The other two cells are empty because their rows and columns have conflicting colors. So, it's a valid maximal placement.

So, in the 2x2 case, the total number of assignments is 16, which includes all possible row and column colorings.

Therefore, for the 5x5 grid, the number is 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024.

But wait, the problem says "some of these chips", which could imply that the grid isn't necessarily full. But in our model, the grid is always maximal, meaning that it's as filled as possible given the row and column colorings, but not necessarily completely filled.



---------------

Wait, but in the 2x2 case, when r=2, c=2, the grid is fully filled with white chips. Similarly, r=0, c=0 gives all black chips. For other (r, c), the grid is partially filled, but maximally so.

So, the total number of such assignments is indeed 2^(5+5)=1024.

Therefore, the answer should be 1024.


To solve the problem, we analyze the conditions and constraints step by step:

1. **Conditions on Placement**:
   - Each cell can contain at most one chip.
   - All chips in the same row must be the same color.
   - All chips in the same column must be the same color.
   - The placement is maximal, meaning no additional chip can be placed without violating the previous conditions.

2. **Implications of the Conditions**:
   - For each row, we assign a color (white or black). Similarly, for each column, we assign a color (white or black).
   - A cell will contain a chip only if the row and column it belongs to have the same color. If the row and column have different colors, the cell remains empty.
   - The placement is maximal, meaning every empty cell is in a row and column of different colors. Thus, the grid is as filled as possible given the row and column color assignments.

3. **Counting Valid Assignments**:
   - Each row can independently be assigned a color (white or black), and each column can independently be assigned a color (white or black).
   - There are \(2^5\) ways to assign colors to the rows and \(2^5\) ways to assign colors to the columns.
   - Therefore, the total number of valid assignments is \(2^5 \times 2^5 = 1024\).

4. **Verification**:
   - For smaller grids (e.g., \(1 \times 1\) or \(2 \times 2\)), the same reasoning applies, confirming that the total number of valid assignments is indeed \(2^{n+m}\) for an \(n \times m\) grid. For a \(5 \times 5\) grid, this is \(2^{5+5} = 1024\).

Thus, the number of ways to place the chips under the given conditions is:

\boxed{1024}
