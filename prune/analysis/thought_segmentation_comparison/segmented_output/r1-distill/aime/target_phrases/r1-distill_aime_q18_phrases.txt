Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. It's about triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. The problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB·AC. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, let me recall what circumradius and inradius mean. The circumradius is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius is the radius of the inscribed circle. So, R = 13 and r = 6.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems important. Maybe I can use some properties related to the incenter and circumradius.

I remember that in any triangle, the inradius r can be expressed in terms of the area (Δ) and the semiperimeter (s) as r = Δ/s. Also, the circumradius R is given by R = (a·b·c)/(4Δ), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle.

But I'm not sure how to use the fact that IA is perpendicular to OI. Let me think about the positions of O and I. The circumcenter is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors, and the incenter is the intersection of the angle bisectors. Maybe there's a relationship between their positions when IA is perpendicular to OI.



---------------

Wait, maybe I can use coordinate geometry. Let me place the triangle in a coordinate system to make things easier. Maybe place point A at (0,0), point B at (c,0), and point C somewhere in the plane. But I'm not sure if that will help directly.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula that relates the distance between the incenter and circumcenter. I remember the formula: OI² = R(R - 2r). Let me verify that. Yes, that's correct. The distance between the circumcenter and incenter is sqrt(R(R - 2r)). 



---------------

Wait, in this case, OI is the distance between O and I, so OI² = R(R - 2r) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So OI = sqrt(13). But the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So maybe I can use the Pythagorean theorem somewhere.

Let me consider triangle IOA. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, triangle IOA is a right-angled triangle with right angle at A. 

---------------

Wait, no, the right angle is at I because IA is perpendicular to OI. So point I is the right angle. So triangle IOA is right-angled at I.

So in triangle IOA, OA is the distance from O to A, which is the circumradius, so OA = R = 13. OI is sqrt(13), as we calculated. IA is the length from I to A, which is the distance from the inradius to vertex A.



---------------

Wait, IA isn't the inradius. The inradius is the distance from I to any side, not to the vertex. Hmm, so IA is a segment from the incenter to vertex A. Is there a formula for that?

Yes, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed. Let me recall. For any triangle, the distance from the incenter I to vertex A is sqrt(r² + (s - a)²), where s is the semiperimeter and a is the side opposite vertex A. 

---------------

Wait, is that correct?

Alternatively, maybe it's better to use vectors or coordinate geometry. Let me think about another approach.

Since triangle IOA is right-angled at I, by Pythagoras, OA² = OI² + IA². OA is 13, OI is sqrt(13), so:

13² = (sqrt(13))² + IA²  
169 = 13 + IA²  
IA² = 169 -13 = 156  
IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39)

So IA is 2*sqrt(39). Now, I need to relate IA to the sides of the triangle.



---------------

Wait, IA is the distance from incenter I to vertex A. I remember that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles. Maybe using trigonometric identities.

Let me denote the angles at A, B, C as α, β, γ respectively. Then, the inradius r = 6, and the distance IA can be expressed as IA = r / sin(α/2). 

---------------

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, I think the formula is that the distance from the inradius to the vertex is IA = r / sin(α/2). Let me check.



---------------

Alternatively, I think IA = (r) / sin(α/2). Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should derive it.

Let me consider the inradius. The inradius is the distance from I to each side. So in triangle AIF, where F is the point where the incircle touches side BC, the distance from I to BC is r = 6. The angle at A is α, so the angle between IA and the angle bisector is α/2.



---------------

Wait, in triangle AIF, angle at I is α/2. So using the sine formula: IA / sin(angle opposite) = IF / sin(angle at A). 

---------------

Wait, maybe not. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, in triangle AIF, which is a right triangle because IF is perpendicular to BC, and angle at I is α/2. So IA is the hypotenuse, and IF is opposite to angle α/2. So sin(α/2) = IF / IA. But IF is the inradius r, so sin(α/2) = r / IA. Therefore, IA = r / sin(α/2).

Yes, that makes sense. So IA = r / sin(α/2). So IA = 6 / sin(α/2). Earlier, we found IA = 2*sqrt(39). So:

6 / sin(α/2) = 2*sqrt(39)  
sin(α/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39))  
sin(α/2) = 3 / sqrt(39)  
Simplify sqrt(39): sqrt(13*3) = sqrt(13)*sqrt(3). So:

sin(α/2) = 3 / (sqrt(13)*sqrt(3))  
Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(3):

sin(α/2) = (3*sqrt(3)) / (sqrt(13)*3) )  


---------------

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, 3/sqrt(39) can be written as sqrt(3)/sqrt(13). Because 3/sqrt(39) = 3/(sqrt(13)*sqrt(3)) )= (3)/(sqrt(13)*sqrt(3)) = sqrt(3)/sqrt(13) after rationalizing.



---------------

Wait, let's do it step by step:

sin(α/2) = 3 / sqrt(39)  
Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(39):

sin(α/2) = (3*sqrt(39)) / 39  
Simplify 3/39 = 1/13:

sin(α/2) = sqrt(39)/13  


---------------

Wait, that can't be right because sqrt(39) is approximately 6.245, so sqrt(39)/13 ≈ 0.48. So sin(α/2) ≈ 0.48, which is acceptable since it's less than 1.

So, sin(α/2) = sqrt(39)/13.

Then, cos(α/2) can be found using the identity sin²x + cos²x = 1.

So cos(α/2) = sqrt(1 - (39/169)) = sqrt( (169 - 39)/169 ) = sqrt(130/169) = sqrt(130)/13.

Now, I need to relate this to the sides of the triangle. Maybe using the formula for area.

The area Δ can be expressed in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter: Δ = r*s, where s is the semiperimeter.

Also, the area can be expressed using the formula (1/2)*ab*sinC, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.



---------------

Wait, let me recall that in any triangle, the length of the side can be expressed in terms of the circumradius and the angles. The formula is a = 2R sinα, b = 2R sinβ, c = 2R sinγ.

So, since R = 13, a = 26 sinα, b = 26 sinβ, c = 26 sinγ.

But I need AB·AC, which is the product of sides b and c (if we consider standard notation where a is BC, b is AC, c is AB). 

---------------

Wait, actually, let me confirm the notation.

In standard notation, a is BC, opposite angle A; b is AC, opposite angle B; c is AB, opposite angle C. So AB is c, and AC is b. So AB·AC = b*c.

So, I need to find b*c. Since b = 26 sinβ and c = 26 sinγ, then b*c = (26)^2 sinβ sinγ = 676 sinβ sinγ.

So, if I can find sinβ sinγ, then I can find b*c.

But how can I find sinβ sinγ? Maybe using angle relations.

In a triangle, α + β + γ = π. So, β + γ = π - α.

I also know that cos(α/2) = sqrt(130)/13, so α/2 is an angle whose cosine is sqrt(130)/13, and sine is sqrt(39)/13.

Hmm, perhaps using the formula for sinβ sinγ. Let me think.

We can use the identity:

sinβ sinγ = [cos(β - γ) - cos(β + γ)] / 2

Since β + γ = π - α, we have:

sinβ sinγ = [cos(β - γ) - cos(π - α)] / 2  
But cos(π - α) = -cosα, so:

sinβ sinγ = [cos(β - γ) + cosα] / 2

But I don't know cosα or cos(β - γ). Maybe I can find cosα.

We know that α is an angle in the triangle, and we have sin(α/2) and cos(α/2). So, we can find cosα using the double-angle formula:

cosα = 1 - 2 sin²(α/2)  
= 1 - 2*(39/169)  
= 1 - 78/169  
= (169 - 78)/169  
= 91/169  
= 13/23.



---------------

Wait, 91 divided by 13 is 7, 169 is 13². So 91/169 = 7/13. So cosα = 7/13.



---------------

Wait, let me check that again:

cosα = 1 - 2 sin²(α/2)  
= 1 - 2*(39/169)  
= 1 - (78/169)  
= (169 - 78)/169  
= 91/169  
= 7/13. Yes, correct.

So cosα = 7/13.

So, sinβ sinγ = [cos(β - γ) + 7/13]/2

But I don't know cos(β - γ). Hmm, maybe I can find another relation.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for area in terms of inradius and semiperimeter.

Δ = r*s = 6*s.

Also, Δ can be expressed as (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/52.

So, 6*s = (a*b*c)/52.

But a = 26 sinα, b = 26 sinβ, c = 26 sinγ.

So, a*b*c = 26³ sinα sinβ sinγ.

So, 6*s = (26³ sinα sinβ sinγ)/52  
Simplify 26³ /52 = (26*26*26)/(2*26) ) = (26²)/2 = (676)/2 = 338.

So, 6*s = 338 sinα sinβ sinγ  
=> sinα sinβ sinγ = (6*s)/338 = (3*s)/169.

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe I need another approach.



---------------

Wait, let's think about the formula for the area. Also, Δ = (1/2)ab sinC, but again, not sure.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe using the formula for the semiperimeter s in terms of the inradius and the area. s = Δ/r.

So, s = Δ/6.

But Δ is also equal to (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/52.

So, s = (a*b*c)/(52*6) = (a*b*c)/312.

But s is also equal to (a + b + c)/2.

So,

(a + b + c)/2 = (a*b*c)/312  
Multiply both sides by 312:

156(a + b + c) = a*b*c

Hmm, that's an equation involving a, b, c. But I'm not sure how to proceed from here.



---------------

Wait, let me think about another formula. The distance from the inradius to the vertex A is IA = 2*sqrt(r R). 

---------------

Wait, does that formula exist?

Wait, no, I think that's for the exradius or something else. Let me think again.



---------------

Wait, earlier I found IA = 2*sqrt(39). And I also have IA = r / sin(α/2) = 6 / sin(α/2). So, 6 / sin(α/2) = 2*sqrt(39) => sin(α/2) = 3/sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13, which we already did.

Is there a way to relate α to the sides? Maybe using the Law of Cosines.

Law of Cosines says:

a² = b² + c² - 2bc cosα

But a = 26 sinα, as before.

So,

(26 sinα)² = b² + c² - 2bc*(7/13)

But I also have expressions for b and c in terms of angles.



---------------

Wait, b = 26 sinβ, c = 26 sinγ.

So, plug these in:

(26 sinα)² = (26 sinβ)^2 + (26 sinγ)^2 - 2*(26 sinβ)*(26 sinγ)*(7/13)

Simplify:

676 sin²α = 676 sin²β + 676 sin²γ - 2*(676 sinβ sinγ)*(7/13)

Divide both sides by 676:

sin²α = sin²β + sin²γ - (2* sinβ sinγ *7/13)

But since β + γ = π - α, maybe we can express sin²β + sin²γ in terms of α.



---------------

Wait, let's compute sin²β + sin²γ.

We can use the identity:

sin²β + sin²γ = 1 - cos²β + 1 - cos²γ all over 2? 

---------------

Wait, no, that's for sum.

Wait, another approach. Since β + γ = π - α, let me set θ = β and φ = γ, so θ + φ = π - α.

We can express sin²θ + sin²φ.

We know that sin²θ + sin²φ = 1 - cos(2θ)/2 + 1 - cos(2φ)/2 = 1 - [cos(2θ) + cos(2φ)] / 2



---------------

Alternatively, using sum-to-product:

cos(2θ) + cos(2φ) = 2 cos(θ + φ) cos(θ - φ) = 2 cos(π - α) cos(θ - φ) = -2 cosα cos(θ - φ)

So,

sin²θ + sin²φ = 1 - [ -2 cosα cos(θ - φ) ] / 2  
= 1 + cosα cos(θ - φ)

Hmm, but I don't know cos(θ - φ) which is cos(β - γ). So,

sin²β + sin²γ = 1 + cosα cos(β - γ)

But from earlier, we have:

sin²α = sin²β + sin²γ - (14/13) sinβ sinγ

Substituting sin²β + sin²γ = 1 + cosα cos(β - γ):

sin²α = 1 + cosα cos(β - γ) - (14/13) sinβ sinγ

But sin²α = 1 - cos²α = 1 - (49/169) = 120/169.

So,

120/169 = 1 + (7/13) cos(β - γ) - (14/13) sinβ sinγ



---------------

Wait, because cosα = 7/13. So,

120/169 = 1 + (7/13) cos(β - γ) - (14/13) sinβ sinγ

Let me subtract 1 from both sides:

120/169 - 1 = (7/13) cos(β - γ) - (14/13) sinβ sinγ  
-49/169 = (7/13) cos(β - γ) - (14/13) sinβ sinγ

Multiply both sides by 13 to eliminate denominators:

-49/13 = 7 cos(β - γ) - 14 sinβ sinγ

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I need another approach.



---------------

Wait, earlier I found that sinβ sinγ = [cos(β - γ) + cosα]/2, which is [cos(β - γ) + 7/13]/2.

Let me substitute that into the equation.

So,

-49/13 = 7 cos(β - γ) - 14 * [ (cos(β - γ) + 7/13)/2 ]

Simplify the second term:

14 * [ (cos(β - γ) + 7/13)/2 ] = 7 [cos(β - γ) + 7/13]

So,

-49/13 = 7 cos(β - γ) -7 cos(β - γ) - 49/13

Simplify:

-49/13 = 0 - 49/13  
-49/13 = -49/13

Hmm, that's an identity. So this approach doesn't give new information. Maybe I need another way.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I can express the product b*c in terms of the area and other known quantities.

We know that Δ = r*s = 6*s, and also Δ = (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/52.

So,

6s = (a b c)/52  
=> a b c = 312 s

But a = 26 sinα, b = 26 sinβ, c = 26 sinγ.

So,

26 sinα * 26 sinβ * 26 sinγ = 312 s  
=> 26³ sinα sinβ sinγ = 312 s  
Divide both sides by 26:

26² sinα sinβ sinγ = 12 s  
=> 676 sinα sinβ sinγ = 12 s  
So,

s = (676 / 12) sinα sinβ sinγ  
s = (169 / 3) sinα sinβ sinγ

But s is also equal to (a + b + c)/2 = (26 sinα + 26 sinβ + 26 sinγ)/2 = 13 (sinα + sinβ + sinγ).

So,

13 (sinα + sinβ + sinγ) = (169 / 3) sinα sinβ sinγ  
Divide both sides by 13:

sinα + sinβ + sinγ = (13 / 3) sinα sinβ sinγ

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can express sinα in terms of sinβ and sinγ.



---------------

Wait, since α + β + γ = π, perhaps using the sine addition formula.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to use another formula. 

---------------

Wait, I remember that in a triangle, the product sinα sinβ sinγ can be expressed in terms of the area and the circumradius.



---------------

Wait, the formula is:

sinα sinβ sinγ = (Δ)/(2R³)

Wait, let me check. Since a = 2R sinα, b = 2R sinβ, c = 2R sinγ.

So, a b c = 8 R³ sinα sinβ sinγ.

But Δ = (a b c)/(4R) => Δ = (8 R³ sinα sinβ sinγ)/(4 R) ) = 2 R² sinα sinβ sinγ.

So,

sinα sinβ sinγ = Δ/(2 R²) = Δ/(2*169)

But Δ = 6 s, so:

sinα sinβ sinγ = (6 s)/(2*169) = (3 s)/169.

So, from earlier, we have:

sinα + sinβ + sinγ = (13/3) sinα sinβ sinγ = (13/3)*(3 s /169) )= (13/3)*(3 s /169) )= s /13.

So,

sinα + sinβ + sinγ = s /13.

But s = (a + b + c)/2 = (26 sinα + 26 sinβ + 26 sinγ)/2 = 13 (sinα + sinβ + sinγ).

So,

sinα + sinβ + sinγ = s /13 = [13 (sinα + sinβ + sinγ)] /13 = sinα + sinβ + sinγ.

Which is just an identity, so again, not helpful.

Hmm, I'm stuck here. Maybe I need to find another relationship.



---------------

Wait, let me think about the formula for the distance from I to A again. IA = 2*sqrt(r R) = 2*sqrt(6*13) = 2*sqrt(78). 

---------------

Wait, but earlier I found IA = 2*sqrt(39). So which is it?

Wait, that formula might not be correct. Let me check. I think the formula IA = sqrt(r² + (s - a)^2) is correct, where s is the semiperimeter and a is the side opposite vertex A.

So, IA² = r² + (s - a)^2.

We have IA = 2*sqrt(39), so IA² = 4*39 = 156.

So,

156 = r² + (s - a)^2  
156 = 36 + (s - a)^2  
(s - a)^2 = 156 - 36 = 120  
s - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30)

So, s - a = 2*sqrt(30)

Similarly, the distances from the inradius to other vertices can be expressed, but maybe this will help.

We know that s - a = (b + c - a)/2. Because s = (a + b + c)/2, so s - a = (-a + b + c)/2.

So,

(-a + b + c)/2 = 2 sqrt(30)  
=> -a + b + c = 4 sqrt(30)  
=> b + c = a + 4 sqrt(30)

Hmm, that's one equation.

We also have the Law of Cosines:

a² = b² + c² - 2 b c cosα  
We know cosα = 7/13, so:

a² = b² + c² - (14/13) b c

Also, from earlier, we have:

b + c = a + 4 sqrt(30)

Let me denote b + c = a + k, where k = 4 sqrt(30).

So, (b + c)^2 = a² + 2 a k + k²  
=> b² + c² + 2 b c = a² + 8 a sqrt(30) + 16*30  
= a² + 8 a sqrt(30) + 480

But from the Law of Cosines, a² = b² + c² - (14/13) b c.

So, let's substitute a² into the equation:

b² + c² + 2 b c = [b² + c² - (14/13) b c] + 8 a sqrt(30) + 480

Subtract b² + c² from both sides:

2 b c = - (14/13) b c + 8 a sqrt(30) + 480

Bring the (14/13) b c to the left:

2 b c + (14/13) b c = 8 a sqrt(30) + 480  
Convert 2 to 26/13 to have a common denominator:

(26/13 +14/13) b c = 8 a sqrt(30) + 480  
(40/13) b c = 8 a sqrt(30) + 480

Multiply both sides by 13:

40 b c = 104 a sqrt(30) + 6240  
Divide both sides by 8:

5 b c = 13 a sqrt(30) + 780  
So,

5 b c = 13 a sqrt(30) + 780

Hmm, that's another equation. Now, I have two equations:

1) b + c = a + 4 sqrt(30)  
2) 5 b c = 13 a sqrt(30) + 780

I need to solve these equations for b and c in terms of a.

Let me denote S = b + c = a + 4 sqrt(30), and P = b c.

From equation 2:

5 P = 13 a sqrt(30) + 780  
=> P = (13 a sqrt(30) + 780)/5

Now, from equation 1, S = a + 4 sqrt(30). So, we can express P in terms of S:

P = (13 a sqrt(30) + 780)/5

But S = a + 4 sqrt(30)  
=> a = S - 4 sqrt(30)

Substitute a into P:

P = [13 (S - 4 sqrt(30)) sqrt(30) + 780 ] /5  
Let me compute this:

First, compute 13 (S - 4 sqrt(30)) sqrt(30):

= 13 S sqrt(30) - 13 * 4 * 30  
= 13 S sqrt(30) - 1560

So,

P = [13 S sqrt(30) - 1560 + 780 ] /5  
= [13 S sqrt(30) - 780 ] /5  
= (13 S sqrt(30))/5 - 156

So, P = (13 S sqrt(30))/5 - 156

But we also know that in a quadratic equation, if b and c are roots, then x² - S x + P = 0. So,

x² - S x + P = 0  
But I don't know if that's helpful here.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I can express S in terms of a, but that might not help. Alternatively, maybe I can express a in terms of S.



---------------

Wait, let me think about another approach. We have S and P in terms of a, so perhaps I can find another equation involving a.



---------------

Wait, we know that a = 26 sinα, and earlier, we have expressions involving sinα, etc. Maybe I can relate a to S and P.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the area in two different ways.

We have Δ = 6 s = 6*( (a + b + c)/2 ) = 3*(a + b + c).

Also, Δ = (1/2) b c sinA.



---------------

Wait, sinA is sinα, which we know. From earlier, sinα = 2 sin(α/2) cos(α/2) = 2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13) )= 2*sqrt(39*130)/169.

Compute sqrt(39*130):

39*130 = 5070. sqrt(5070) = sqrt(10*507) = sqrt(10*3*13*13) )= 13 sqrt(390). 

---------------

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 5070 = 507 * 10 = 13*39 * 10 = 13*13*3*10. So sqrt(5070) = 13*sqrt(30).

So, sinα = 2*(13 sqrt(30))/169 = (26 sqrt(30))/169 = 2 sqrt(30)/13.

So, sinα = 2 sqrt(30)/13.

Therefore, Δ = (1/2) b c sinα = (1/2) b c (2 sqrt(30)/13) )= (b c sqrt(30))/13.

But also, Δ = 3*(a + b + c) = 3*(a + S) = 3*(a + a + 4 sqrt(30)) )= 3*(2a + 4 sqrt(30)) )= 6a + 12 sqrt(30).

So,

(b c sqrt(30))/13 = 6a + 12 sqrt(30)

Multiply both sides by 13:

b c sqrt(30) = 78 a + 156 sqrt(30)

Divide both sides by sqrt(30):

b c = (78 a)/sqrt(30) + 156

Rationalize the denominator:

78 a / sqrt(30) = (78 a sqrt(30)) /30 = (13 a sqrt(30))/5

So,

b c = (13 a sqrt(30))/5 + 156

But from equation 2 earlier, we had:

P = b c = (13 a sqrt(30) + 780)/5

Which is the same as (13 a sqrt(30))/5 + 156, since 780/5 = 156. So that's consistent.

Hmm, so this doesn't give any new information. I'm going in circles here.



---------------

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that b + c = a + 4 sqrt(30), and we have expressions for b c in terms of a. So, perhaps I can write a quadratic equation in terms of a.

Let me denote S = b + c = a + 4 sqrt(30), and P = b c = (13 a sqrt(30) + 780)/5.

So, if I consider b and c as roots of the quadratic equation x² - S x + P = 0.

So,

x² - (a + 4 sqrt(30)) x + (13 a sqrt(30) + 780)/5 = 0

But I don't know if that's helpful. Maybe I can find another equation involving a.



---------------

Wait, earlier we had from Law of Cosines:

a² = b² + c² - (14/13) b c

But b² + c² = (b + c)^2 - 2 b c = S² - 2 P

So,

a² = (S² - 2 P) - (14/13) P  
= S² - 2 P - (14/13) P  
= S² - (26/13 +14/13) P  
= S² - (40/13) P

So,

a² = S² - (40/13) P

But S = a + 4 sqrt(30), and P = (13 a sqrt(30) + 780)/5

So,

a² = (a + 4 sqrt(30))² - (40/13)* (13 a sqrt(30) + 780)/5

Let me compute each term.

First, expand (a + 4 sqrt(30))²:

= a² + 8 a sqrt(30) + 16*30  
= a² + 8 a sqrt(30) + 480

Second, compute (40/13) * (13 a sqrt(30) + 780)/5:

= (40/13) * [ (13 a sqrt(30) + 780) /5 ]  
= (40/13) * (13 a sqrt(30)/5 + 780/5)  
= (40/13)*( (13 a sqrt(30))/5 + 156 )

Simplify:

= (40/13)*( (13 a sqrt(30))/5 ) + (40/13)*156  
= (40/5) a sqrt(30) + (40 *156)/13  
= 8 a sqrt(30) + (40 *12)  
= 8 a sqrt(30) + 480

So, putting it all together:

a² = [a² + 8 a sqrt(30) + 480] - [8 a sqrt(30) + 480]

Simplify the right-hand side:

a² + 8 a sqrt(30) + 480 -8 a sqrt(30) -480 = a²

So,

a² = a²

Which is an identity. Again, no new information. Hmm.

I'm stuck here. Maybe I need to find another equation or approach.



---------------

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that s = (a + b + c)/2 = 13 (sinα + sinβ + sinγ)

But earlier, we found that sinα = 2 sqrt(30)/13. So,

s = 13 [ (2 sqrt(30)/13) + sinβ + sinγ ]

But I don't know sinβ + sinγ. Hmm.



---------------

Wait, another idea. Since α + β + γ = π, perhaps using the sine addition formulas.

But I don't see a direct way to apply that.



---------------

Wait, maybe using the formula for the distance between O and I.

Earlier, we found that OI² = R(R - 2r) = 13*(13 -12) =13. So, OI = sqrt(13).

We also know that in triangle IOA, which is right-angled at I, we have OA =13, OI= sqrt(13), IA=2 sqrt(39).

So, from triangle IOA, we have:

OA² = OI² + IA²  
13² = (sqrt(13))² + (2 sqrt(39))²  
169 =13 + 4*39  
169 =13 +156  
169=169. Correct.

So, that's consistent, but doesn't give new info.



---------------

Wait, perhaps using vector methods. Let me consider vectors for points O and I.

But I don't have enough information about their positions relative to the triangle.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe using trigonometric identities.

Wait, I know that in any triangle, the distance between O and I is given by OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r)).

We used that already.



---------------

Wait, perhaps using Euler's formula, which states OI² = R(R - 2r). We did that.



---------------

Another thought: maybe using the formula for the distance from I to A, which we have as IA = 2 sqrt(39).

But IA is the length from I to A, and I is the inradius. Maybe using coordinates.

Let me try coordinate geometry. Let me place the incenter I at (0,0). Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and OI is the line from I(0,0) to O. So, if IA is perpendicular to OI, then IA is along the direction perpendicular to OI.

But this might get complicated. 

---------------

Alternatively, let me place point A at (0,0), point I at some point (h,k), and point O somewhere else.



---------------

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the formula for IA.

Earlier, we had IA² = r² + (s - a)^2. So, IA² = 36 + (s - a)^2 = 156. So, (s -a)^2 = 120, s -a = 2 sqrt(30). So, s = a + 2 sqrt(30).

But s = (a + b + c)/2. So,

(a + b + c)/2 = a + 2 sqrt(30)  
=> a + b + c = 2 a + 4 sqrt(30)  
=> b + c = a + 4 sqrt(30)

Which is the same as before.

So, I'm not making progress. Maybe I need to find another equation involving a, b, c.



---------------

Wait, from the Law of Sines:

a = 2 R sinα = 26 sinα  
b = 26 sinβ  
c = 26 sinγ

We know that sinα = 2 sqrt(30)/13.

So,

a = 26 * (2 sqrt(30)/13) )= 2*2 sqrt(30) = 4 sqrt(30)

So, a =4 sqrt(30). Oh! That's a breakthrough.

So, a =4 sqrt(30). Then, from earlier, b + c = a +4 sqrt(30) =4 sqrt(30) +4 sqrt(30) =8 sqrt(30).

So, b + c =8 sqrt(30).

Also, from equation 2:

5 b c =13 a sqrt(30) +780  
=13*(4 sqrt(30))*sqrt(30) +780  
=13*4*30 +780  
=1560 +780  
=2340  
So,

5 b c =2340  
=> b c =468

So, the product of b and c is 468. Since AB is c and AC is b, then AB·AC = b c =468.

So, the answer is 468.


To solve the problem, we start by noting that the circumradius \( R = 13 \) and the inradius \( r = 6 \). The condition \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \) implies that triangle \( IOA \) is right-angled at \( I \). Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \( IOA \), we have:

\[
OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2
\]

Since \( OA = R = 13 \) and \( OI = \sqrt{R(R - 2r)} = \sqrt{13(13 - 12)} = \sqrt{13} \), we substitute these values:

\[
13^2 = (\sqrt{13})^2 + IA^2 \implies 169 = 13 + IA^2 \implies IA^2 = 156 \implies IA = 2\sqrt{39}
\]

The distance \( IA \) can also be expressed as \( IA = \frac{r}{\sin(\alpha/2)} \), where \( \alpha \) is the angle at vertex \( A \). Substituting \( IA = 2\sqrt{39} \) and \( r = 6 \):

\[
2\sqrt{39} = \frac{6}{\sin(\alpha/2)} \implies \sin(\alpha/2) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{39}} = \frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}
\]

Using the double-angle identity for cosine:

\[
\cos\alpha = 1 - 2\sin^2(\alpha/2) = 1 - 2\left(\frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}\right)^2 = 1 - \frac{78}{169} = \frac{91}{169} = \frac{7}{13}
\]

Next, we use the Law of Cosines in triangle \( ABC \):

\[
a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\cos\alpha
\]

We also know from the Law of Sines that \( a = 2R\sin\alpha \). Since \( \sin\alpha = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2\alpha} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{7}{13}\right)^2} = \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13} \), we find:

\[
a = 26 \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13} = 4\sqrt{30}
\]

Using the relationship \( b + c = a + 4\sqrt{30} \) and substituting \( a = 4\sqrt{30} \), we get:

\[
b + c = 8\sqrt{30}
\]

Finally, using the product \( bc \) from the quadratic equation derived earlier:

\[
5bc = 13a\sqrt{30} + 780 \implies 5bc = 13 \cdot 4\sqrt{30} \cdot \sqrt{30} + 780 = 2340 \implies bc = 468
\]

Thus, the product \( AB \cdot AC = bc = 468 \).

\[
\boxed{468}
\]
