Okay, so I have this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to parse what's being asked.

The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. That's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis is along the x-axis because the positive term is with x².

Now, points A, B, C, D are on this hyperbola, and they form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. That makes sense because in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other.

I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, essentially, I'm looking for the infimum of BD², the lower bound, but expressed as the greatest number less than BD². 

---------------

Wait, no, wait. The problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So that would be the infimum of BD² across all possible such rhombi. Because BD² can get arbitrarily close to some minimum value, and we're looking for the greatest number that is still less than all BD². So, maybe the infimum is the minimum possible BD², and we have to find that.



---------------

Wait, actually, let me think again. If we have multiple rhombi, each with their own BD². The problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. That is, find the maximum lower bound for BD² across all possible rhombi. So, it's like the infimum of BD². Because the infimum is the greatest lower bound. So, yes, the answer would be the infimum of BD².

So, I need to find the minimum possible value of BD², which is the square of the length of one of the diagonals of the rhombus, and then express it as the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi. So, if the minimum BD² is m, then the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi would be m itself, but if BD² can be as small as m, then m is the infimum. 

---------------

Wait, but the problem says "less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, perhaps it's the infimum. Hmm.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe BD² can approach a certain limit, but never actually reach it. So, the infimum would be that limit. So, I need to find the minimum possible BD² across all rhombi, but maybe it's not attainable, so the infimum is that value.

But let's move on and try to model the problem.

Given that ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, which is the midpoint. So, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin. So, points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other.

Since the hyperbola is symmetric about both axes, and the origin is the center, the rhombus must be symmetric with respect to both axes as well. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, points B and D must be symmetric in some way. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, they must pass through the origin. So, the diagonals are the lines connecting A to C and B to D.

In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular to each other. 

---------------

Wait, no, that's only in a square. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Yes, that's correct. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular.

Therefore, the lines AC and BD are perpendicular and intersect at the origin.

So, if points A and C are on the hyperbola, and points B and D are also on the hyperbola, with diagonals AC and BD being perpendicular, intersecting at the origin.

So, let's model the points. Let me denote points A, B, C, D as follows: since it's a rhombus, the sides are equal, but the diagonals are perpendicular.

Let me denote point A as (x, y), so point C is (-x, -y). Similarly, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the other diagonal BD must be along a line perpendicular to AC.

The line AC has a slope of (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x. So, the slope of BD, being perpendicular, must be -x/y.

So, the diagonal BD is a line through the origin with slope -x/y.

Therefore, points B and D lie on this line, so their coordinates can be expressed as (t, (-x/y) t) for some parameter t.

But points B and D are also on the hyperbola. So, substituting into the hyperbola equation:

x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.



---------------

Wait, no. For points B and D, which are (t, (-x/y) t), substituting into the hyperbola equation:

t² / 20 - [(-x/y t)²] / 24 = 1.

Simplify that:

t² / 20 - (x² t² / y²) / 24 = 1.

Factor out t²:

t² [1/20 - (x²)/(24 y²)] = 1.

So, t² = 1 / [1/20 - (x²)/(24 y²)].



---------------

But wait, t² must be positive, so the denominator must be positive. So,

1/20 - (x²)/(24 y²) > 0.

So,

(24 y² - 20 x²) / (24*20 y²) > 0.

Which implies 24 y² - 20 x² > 0.

But the hyperbola equation is x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, so x² = 20(1 + y²/24). Let's substitute that into the inequality.

24 y² - 20 * [20(1 + y²/24)] > 0.



---------------

Wait, that might get messy. Let me compute 24 y² - 20 x².

But since x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, x² = 20(1 + y²/24). So,

24 y² - 20 x² = 24 y² - 20 * [20(1 + y²/24)] = 24 y² - 400(1 + y²/24).

Let's compute that:

24 y² - 400 - (400 y²)/24.

Simplify the terms:

Convert 24 y² to 24*24 y² /24 to have a common denominator.



---------------

Wait, maybe it's better to compute it as:

24 y² - 400 - (400 y²)/24 = (24^2 y² - 400 *24 - 400 y²) /24.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I should compute it step by step.

Compute 24 y² - 400 - (400 y²)/24.

Convert 24 y² to (24^2 y²)/24 to have a common denominator.

24 y² = (576 y²)/24.

So,

(576 y²)/24 - 400 - (400 y²)/24 = [576 y² - 400 y²]/24 - 400 = (176 y²)/24 - 400.

Simplify:

176/24 = 22/3.

So,

(22/3) y² - 400 > 0.

So,

(22/3) y² > 400

y² > (400 * 3)/22 = 1200/22 ≈ 54.545.

So, y² must be greater than approximately 54.545 for the denominator to be positive, which allows t² to be positive.

Hmm, that's interesting. So, for points B and D to exist on the hyperbola on the line with slope -x/y, the y-coordinate of A must satisfy y² > 1200/22.



---------------

Wait, let me check my calculations again because that seems a bit high.

Wait, starting again.

Given that points B and D are (t, (-x/y) t). Substituting into hyperbola:

t² /20 - [ ( (-x/y) t )² ] /24 = 1.

Which is t² [1/20 - (x²)/(24 y²)] =1.

So, t² = 1 / [1/20 - (x²)/(24 y²)].

We need 1/20 - (x²)/(24 y²) > 0.

So, (24 y² - 20 x²) / (24*20 y²) > 0.

Which implies 24 y² - 20 x² >0.

But from the hyperbola equation, x² = 20(1 + y²/24).

So, substituting:

24 y² -20 * [20(1 + y²/24)] >0.

Compute that:

24 y² - 400(1 + y²/24) >0.

Multiply out:

24 y² - 400 - (400 y²)/24 >0.

Convert 24 y² to 24^2 y² /24:

24 y² = (576 y²)/24.

So,

(576 y²)/24 - (400 y²)/24 - 400 >0.

Combine terms:

(576 y² - 400 y²)/24 - 400 >0.

Which is (176 y²)/24 - 400 >0.

Simplify:

176/24 = 22/3.

So,

(22/3)y² - 400 >0.

Then,

(22/3)y² >400.

Multiply both sides by 3/22:

y² > (400 *3)/22 = 1200/22 ≈54.545.

So, yes, y² must be greater than approximately 54.545 for t² to be positive, meaning points B and D exist on the hyperbola on that line.

So, that's a condition on point A. So, point A must lie on the hyperbola such that y² > 1200/22.

So, perhaps point A is in the upper or lower part of the hyperbola beyond a certain point.

Now, moving on.

So, the diagonal BD is along the line with slope -x/y, passing through the origin, and points B and D are at (t, (-x/y) t) and (-t, (x/y) t), since they are symmetric with respect to the origin.



---------------

Wait, no, if the line is through the origin with slope m, then points are (t, m t) and (-t, -m t). So, in this case, m = -x/y, so points B and D are (t, (-x/y) t) and (-t, (x/y) t).

So, the length of BD is the distance between (t, (-x/y) t) and (-t, (x/y) t).

Compute that distance:

sqrt[ (t - (-t))² + ( (-x/y t) - (x/y t) )² ]

Which is sqrt[ (2t)² + ( (-2x/y t) )² ] = sqrt[4t² + 4x² t² / y² ] = 2t sqrt(1 + x² / y² ).

So, BD² = [2t sqrt(1 + x²/y²)]² = 4t² (1 + x² / y²).

But from earlier, t² = 1 / [1/20 - x²/(24 y²)].

So, BD² = 4 * [1 / (1/20 - x²/(24 y²))] * (1 + x²/y²).

Let me compute that.

First, let's compute 1 + x²/y².

From the hyperbola equation, x²/20 - y²/24 =1. Let's solve for x²:

x² =20(1 + y²/24).

So,

x²/y² = 20(1 + y²/24)/y² =20/y² + 20/(24) =20/y² + 5/6.

So, 1 + x²/y² =1 +20/y² +5/6= (6/6 +5/6) +20/y²=11/6 +20/y².

So, BD²=4*(1/[1/20 -x²/(24 y²)])*(11/6 +20/y²).

Now, let's compute the denominator 1/20 -x²/(24 y²).

From x²=20(1 + y²/24), so x²/(24 y²)=20(1 + y²/24)/(24 y²)= [20/(24 y²)] + [20 y²/(24 y²)].

Simplify:

20/(24 y²) =5/(6 y²).

20 y²/(24 y²)=20/24=5/6.

So,

x²/(24 y²)=5/(6 y²) +5/6.

Thus,

1/20 -x²/(24 y²)=1/20 -5/(6 y²) -5/6.

So,

Denominator D=1/20 -5/(6 y²) -5/6.

Let me combine terms:

1/20 -5/6 = (3/60 -50/60)= (-47/60).

So,

D= -47/60 -5/(6 y²).

So,

BD²=4 * [1/(D)] * (11/6 +20/y²).

Substituting D:

BD²=4 * [1/( -47/60 -5/(6 y²) )] * (11/6 +20/y²).

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but perhaps we can simplify it.

Let me factor out some terms.

First, note that:

Denominator D= -47/60 -5/(6 y²)= - (47/60 +5/(6 y²)).

So,

1/D= -1/(47/60 +5/(6 y²)).

So,

BD²=4 * [ -1/(47/60 +5/(6 y²)) ] * (11/6 +20/y²).

But BD² must be positive, so the negative sign must be accounted for.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, the denominator D=1/20 -x²/(24 y²)=1/20 - [20(1 + y²/24)]/(24 y²).

Which is 1/20 - [20/(24 y²) + 20 y²/(24 y²)].

Which is 1/20 - [5/(6 y²) +5/6].

So,

D=1/20 -5/(6 y²) -5/6.

Compute 1/20 -5/6:

1/20 = 3/60,

5/6 =50/60,

So,

3/60 -50/60= -47/60.

Thus,

D= -47/60 -5/(6 y²).

Yes, that's correct.

So, D is negative because both terms are negative. So, 1/D is negative.

But BD² is positive, so when I multiply 4 * [1/D] * (11/6 +20/y²), it's 4*(negative)*(positive), so it's negative. That can't be, because BD² is positive.

Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake in the direction of the diagonal.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I should have considered points B and D as (t, (x/y) t) and (-t, -(x/y) t), but that would be if the slope is positive x/y, but the slope of BD is perpendicular to AC, which had slope y/x. So, the slope of BD should be -x/y, which is negative if x and y are positive.



---------------

Wait, but the points (t, (-x/y) t) and (-t, (x/y) t) would be symmetric across the origin. So, their distance would still be correct.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the hyperbola is symmetric, so when I plug in the points, I have to make sure that they lie on the hyperbola.



---------------

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the direction of the slope. Let me think again.

The slope of AC is y/x, so the slope of BD is -x/y. So, if point A is (x,y), then the line BD has slope -x/y.

So, points on BD are (t, (-x/y) t). So, for t positive and negative, you get two points symmetric about the origin.

So, their coordinates are (t, (-x/y) t) and (-t, (x/y) t).

So, the distance between these two points is sqrt[(2t)^2 + (2x t / y)^2] = 2t sqrt(1 + (x²/y²)).

So, BD squared is 4 t² (1 + x²/y²).

But t² is 1/(1/20 - x²/(24 y²)).

So, BD²=4*(1/(1/20 -x²/(24 y²)))*(1 +x²/y²).



---------------

Wait, earlier I had 1 + x²/y² as 11/6 +20/y², but that might have been incorrect.



---------------

Wait, let me recompute 1 + x²/y².

From hyperbola equation, x²=20(1 + y²/24).

So,

x²/y²=20(1 + y²/24)/y²=20/y² +20/(24)=20/y² +5/6.

Thus,

1 +x²/y²=1 +20/y² +5/6= (6/6 +5/6) +20/y²=11/6 +20/y².

Yes, that part was correct.

So, BD²=4*(1/(D))*(11/6 +20/y²), where D=1/20 -x²/(24 y²)= -47/60 -5/(6 y²).

So,

BD²=4*(1/( -47/60 -5/(6 y²) ))*(11/6 +20/y²).

Let me factor out the negative sign:

BD²=4*(-1/(47/60 +5/(6 y²)))*(11/6 +20/y²).

But BD² is positive, so the negative sign must be canceled. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the direction.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the denominator is positive? Let me check.

Wait, from earlier, we saw that 24 y² -20 x²>0.

But from the hyperbola equation, x²=20(1 + y²/24).

So,

24 y² -20 x²=24 y² -20*20(1 + y²/24)=24 y² -400 - (400 y²)/24.

Which is 24 y² -400 - (16.666... y²)= (24 -16.666...) y² -400.

Which is approximately 7.333 y² -400.



---------------

Wait, but earlier I had:

24 y² -20 x²=22/3 y² -400>0.



---------------

Wait, 22/3≈7.333.

So, 7.333 y² -400>0 implies y²>400/(22/3)=400*3/22≈54.545.

So, when y²>54.545, 24 y² -20 x²>0, which makes D=1/20 -x²/(24 y²)= positive?



---------------

Wait, no, wait.

Wait, D=1/20 -x²/(24 y²)= [24 y² -20 x²]/(24*20 y²).

So, if 24 y² -20 x²>0, then D is positive.

But earlier, I thought D was negative, but that must have been a miscalculation.



---------------

Wait, yes, because:

D= [24 y² -20 x²]/(24*20 y²).

If 24 y² -20 x²>0, then D>0.

So, that would mean t² is positive, as 1/D is positive.

So, BD² is positive.

So, that was my mistake earlier. So, BD² is positive because D is positive.

So, BD²=4*(1/D)*(11/6 +20/y²)=4*(24*20 y²/(24 y² -20 x²))*(11/6 +20/y²).

But since x²=20(1 + y²/24), let's substitute that into D:

D=1/20 -x²/(24 y²)= [24 y² -20 x²]/(24*20 y²).

So, 24 y² -20 x²=24 y² -20*(20(1 + y²/24))=24 y² -400 - (400 y²)/24.

Which is (24 y² - (400 y²)/24) -400.

Compute 24 y² - (400 y²)/24:

24 y² = (24^2 y²)/24=576 y²/24.

So,

576 y²/24 -400 y²/24= (576 y² -400 y²)/24=176 y²/24=22 y²/3.

So,

24 y² -20 x²=22 y²/3 -400.

So,

D=(22 y²/3 -400)/(24*20 y²).

Thus,

1/D=24*20 y²/(22 y²/3 -400).

So,

BD²=4*(24*20 y²/(22 y²/3 -400))*(11/6 +20/y²).

Simplify this expression.

First, compute 24*20=480.

So,

BD²=4*(480 y²/(22 y²/3 -400))*(11/6 +20/y²).

Let me write 22 y²/3 -400 as (22 y² -1200)/3.

So,

BD²=4*(480 y² / [(22 y² -1200)/3 ])*(11/6 +20/y²).

Simplify the division:

480 y² / [(22 y² -1200)/3 ]=480 y² *3/(22 y² -1200)=1440 y²/(22 y² -1200).

So,

BD²=4*(1440 y²/(22 y² -1200))*(11/6 +20/y²).

Now, compute 11/6 +20/y²= (11 y² +120)/6 y².

So,

BD²=4*(1440 y²/(22 y² -1200))*((11 y² +120)/(6 y²)).

Simplify:

4 * [1440 y² * (11 y² +120) ] / [ (22 y² -1200) *6 y² ].

Simplify numerator and denominator:

1440 /6=240.

y² in numerator cancels with y² in denominator.

So,

BD²=4*(240*(11 y² +120))/(22 y² -1200).

Simplify 4*240=960.

So,

BD²=960*(11 y² +120)/(22 y² -1200).

Now, let me write 22 y² -1200 as 22(y² - 1200/22)=22(y² - 54.545...).

But perhaps factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator:11 y² +120=11 y² +120.

Denominator:22 y² -1200=22(y² - 1200/22).

Hmm, perhaps factor 11:

Numerator:11(y² + 120/11)=11(y² + 10.909...).

Denominator:22(y² - 54.545...)=22(y² - 54.545...).

So,

BD²=960*(11(y² +120/11))/(22(y² - 54.545)).

Simplify 11/22=1/2.

So,

BD²=960*(1/2)*(y² +120/11)/(y² - 54.545).

Which is 480*(y² +120/11)/(y² - 54.545).

But 54.545 is 1200/22=54.545...



---------------

Wait, 120/11≈10.909.

So,

BD²=480*(y² +10.909)/(y² -54.545).

Let me write it as:

BD²=480*(y² + 120/11)/(y² - 1200/22).

But 1200/22=600/11≈54.545.

So,

BD²=480*(y² + 120/11)/(y² -600/11).

Let me write this as:

BD²=480*(y² + a)/(y² - b), where a=120/11, b=600/11.

So,

BD²=480*(y² +120/11)/(y² -600/11).

Now, let me set z=y². Since y²>54.545 (which is 600/11≈54.545), z>600/11.

So, BD²=480*(z +120/11)/(z -600/11).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

(z +120/11)=z + (120/11).

(z -600/11)=z - (600/11).

So,

BD²=480*(z +120/11)/(z -600/11).

We can write this as:

BD²=480*(z +120/11)/(z -600/11).

Now, let me write this as:

BD²=480*(z +120/11)/(z -600/11)=480*[(z -600/11 +720/11)]/(z -600/11).

Because 120/11=720/66, but perhaps I can express z +120/11 as (z -600/11) +720/11.

Yes, because:

(z -600/11) +720/11= z + (720/11 -600/11)=z +120/11.

So,

BD²=480*[ (z -600/11) +720/11 ]/(z -600/11).

Which is 480*[1 + (720/11)/(z -600/11)].

So,

BD²=480 + 480*(720/11)/(z -600/11).

Which simplifies to:

BD²=480 + (480*720)/(11*(z -600/11)).

Compute 480*720=345600.

So,

BD²=480 + 345600/(11*(z -600/11)).

But z=y²>600/11, so as z increases, the term 345600/(11*(z -600/11)) decreases, approaching zero. Therefore, BD² approaches 480 as z approaches infinity.

On the other hand, as z approaches 600/11 from above, the denominator approaches zero, making the second term go to infinity. So, BD² approaches infinity as z approaches 600/11+.

Therefore, BD² can be made arbitrarily large, but it has a lower bound.



---------------

Wait, but the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, the infimum of BD² is 480, because as z increases, BD² approaches 480 from above.

So, BD² is always greater than 480, but can be made as close to 480 as desired by choosing points A with very large y². Therefore, the infimum is 480.

Hence, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 480.



---------------

Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, when z approaches infinity, BD² approaches 480.

But when z approaches 600/11 from above, BD² approaches infinity.

So, BD² can be as large as possible, but the minimal BD² is 480, approached as z increases.

Therefore, BD² is always greater than or equal to 480, but since z can't be infinity, BD² can't actually reach 480. It can only approach it.



---------------

Wait, but in reality, since z can be as large as possible, BD² can be as close to 480 as desired, but never less than 480.



---------------

Wait, but wait, in the expression BD²=480 + 345600/(11*(z -600/11)), as z increases, the second term becomes smaller, so BD² approaches 480 from above. So, BD² is always greater than 480.

Therefore, the infimum of BD² is 480. So, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480.



---------------

Wait, but hold on. The problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, since BD² can be made as close to 480 as we like, but never less than 480, the greatest number less than all BD² is 480, because any number greater than 480 would not be less than all BD² (since BD² can be 480 + ε for any ε>0).



---------------

Wait, no. Wait, if the infimum is 480, then for any ε>0, there exists a rhombus with BD² <480 +ε. So, the set of BD² is [480, ∞). So, the greatest number less than all BD² would be 480, because any number less than 480 would not be less than all BD² (since BD² can be larger than 480). 

---------------

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, no. Let me clarify.

If BD² can take any value greater than or equal to 480, then the set of BD² is [480, ∞). So, the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all rhombi would be 480, because for any number less than 480, there exists a rhombus with BD² less than that number? No, wait, no.



---------------

Wait, no. Because BD² is always ≥480, so any number less than 480 would be less than BD² for all rhombi. But the problem asks for the greatest such number. So, the maximum lower bound is 480, since BD² can't be less than 480.



---------------

Wait, I think I got confused earlier.

Wait, the set of BD² is [480, ∞). So, the infimum is 480. So, the greatest number that is less than BD² for all rhombi would be 480, because any number greater than 480 is not less than all BD² (since BD² can be 480). So, the greatest number that is less than BD² for all rhombi is 480, because for any ε>0, 480 +ε is not less than all BD² (since BD² can be 480).



---------------

Wait, that's correct. Because if you take the number 480, it is less than all BD² except when BD²=480. But the problem says "less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, if there exists a rhombus with BD²=480, then 480 is not less than BD² for that rhombus. Therefore, the number must be less than 480.



---------------

Wait, but in our earlier analysis, BD² approaches 480 as z approaches infinity. So, BD² can get arbitrarily close to 480, but never actually reaches 480. So, BD² is in (480, ∞).



---------------

Wait, so if BD² is always greater than 480, then the infimum is 480, but it's not attained. So, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi would be 480, because BD² is always greater than 480, so 480 is less than all BD². 

---------------

But wait, no, because 480 is less than or equal to BD², but the problem says "less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, if BD² can be 480, then 480 is not less than BD² for that rhombus. But in our case, BD² approaches 480 but never actually reaches it. So, BD² is always greater than 480, so 480 is less than all BD².



---------------

Wait, but in reality, BD² can be as close to 480 as we want, but not equal to 480. So, the infimum is 480, but it's not attained. Therefore, for any ε>0, there exists a rhombus with BD² <480 +ε, but BD² is always greater than 480.

So, the set of BD² is (480, ∞). Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480, because any number greater than 480 would not satisfy being less than BD² for all rhombi (since BD² can be just above 480). So, the maximum lower bound is 480.



---------------

Wait, but if BD² is always greater than 480, then 480 is less than all BD². So, 480 is the greatest number with that property.

Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the answer is 480.

But let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

We started by parameterizing points A and C as (x,y) and (-x,-y), then points B and D as (t, (-x/y)t) and (-t, (x/y)t). We substituted into hyperbola equation, found t² in terms of x and y, then expressed BD² in terms of x and y, then substituted x² from hyperbola equation, and after some algebra, found BD² in terms of y², which we set as z. Then, after simplifying, we found BD²=480 + 345600/(11(z -600/11)). As z increases, BD² approaches 480, but is always greater than 480. So, the infimum is 480, which is the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi.

So, the answer is 480.


To solve the problem, we analyze the rhombus \(ABCD\) inscribed in the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Hyperbola and Rhombus Properties**: The hyperbola is centered at the origin, and the rhombus is symmetric with respect to both axes. The diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular.

2. **Parameterization of Points**: Let point \(A\) be \((x, y)\), so point \(C\) is \((-x, -y)\). The other diagonal \(BD\) lies on a line perpendicular to \(AC\), with slope \(-\frac{x}{y}\). Points \(B\) and \(D\) are \((t, -\frac{x}{y}t)\) and \((-t, \frac{x}{y}t)\).

3. **Substituting into Hyperbola**: Substituting \(B\) and \(D\) into the hyperbola equation gives \(t^2 = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{20} - \frac{x^2}{24y^2}}\). This requires \(\frac{1}{20} - \frac{x^2}{24y^2} > 0\), leading to \(24y^2 - 20x^2 > 0\).

4. **Expressing \(BD^2\)**: The length of diagonal \(BD\) is calculated as \(BD^2 = 4t^2 \left(1 + \frac{x^2}{y^2}\right)\). Using \(x^2 = 20(1 + \frac{y^2}{24})\), we express \(BD^2\) in terms of \(y^2\).

5. **Simplifying**: After substituting and simplifying, \(BD^2\) is found to be \(480 + \frac{345600}{11(y^2 - \frac{600}{11})}\). As \(y^2\) increases, \(BD^2\) approaches 480 from above.

6. **Conclusion**: Since \(BD^2\) can be made arbitrarily close to 480 but never less than it, the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi is 480.

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{480}\).
