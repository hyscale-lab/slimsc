Okay, so I have this problem here with logarithms and three variables x, y, z. They're all positive real numbers, which is good because logarith

---------------

ms of non-positive numbers aren't defined. The equations given are:

log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2



---------------

log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3

log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

And I need to find the absolute value of log₂(x⁴ y³ z²), which

---------------

 will be a fraction m/n, then find m + n where m and n are coprime. Alright, let's break

---------------

 this down.

First, I remember that log₂(a/b) = log₂ a - log₂ b. So maybe I can rewrite each equation using

---------------

 this property. Let me try that.

So, the first equation: log₂(x/(y z)) = log₂ x - log₂(y z). Hmm

---------------

, wait, and log₂(y z) is log₂ y + log₂ z. So, putting it all together,

---------------

 the first equation becomes:

log₂ x - (log₂ y + log₂ z) = 1/2

Similarly

---------------

, the second equation: log₂(y/(x z)) = log₂ y - (log₂ x + log₂ z) = 1/3

And the third equation: log₂(z/(x y)) = log₂ z - (log₂ x + log₂ y) = 1/4

Okay

---------------

, so now I have three equations:

1) log₂ x - log₂ y - log₂ z = 1/2


---------------

2) -log₂ x + log₂ y - log₂ z = 1/3
3) -log₂ x - log₂ y + log₂ z = 1/4

Hmm

---------------

, this seems like a system of linear equations with variables as log₂ x, log₂ y, log₂ z. Let

---------------

 me denote:

Let a = log₂ x

b = log₂ y

c = log₂ z

So the equations become:

1) a - b - c = 1/2


---------------

2) -a + b - c = 1/3
3) -a - b + c = 1/4

Now

---------------

, I have three equations:

Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2

Equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3

Equation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4

I

---------------

 need to solve for a, b, c. Once I have a, b, c, I can compute log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)

---------------

 since that's equal to 4a + 3b + 2c. Then take its absolute value.

So,

---------------

 let's write the system:

1) a - b - c = 1/2

2) -a + b - c = 1/3

3) -a - b + c = 1/4

Hmm

---------------

, okay, let's see. Maybe I can add the equations together to find a relation.

Wait, if I add all

---------------

 three equations:

(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4

Let

---------------

's compute the left side:

a - b - c - a + b - c - a - b + c

S

---------------

implify term by term:

a - a - a = -a

-b + b - b = -b

-c - c + c = -c

So the

---------------

 left side is -a - b - c.

The right side: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4.

---------------

 Let's compute that. Let's find a common denominator, which is 12.

1/2 = 6/12,

---------------

 1/3 = 4/12, 1/4 = 3/12. So adding them

---------------

 up: 6 + 4 + 3 = 13/12.

So, we have:

-a - b - c = 13/12

Which

---------------

 can be rewritten as:

a + b + c = -13/12

Hmm, that's interesting. So

---------------

, equation 4 is:

a + b + c = -13/12

Now, I have four equations,

---------------

 but the first three are the original ones. Let's see if I can express each variable in terms of others.

Looking at

---------------

 equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2

If I add equation 4 to equation 1:



---------------

(a - b - c) + (a + b + c) = 1/2 + (-13/12)

S

---------------

implify left side: 2a = (6/12 - 13/12) = (-7/12)

So, 2a = -7/12 =>

---------------

 a = -7/24

Wait, that's a value for a. Let me check that again.

Wait, 

---------------

1/2 is 6/12. So, 6/12 + (-13/12) =

---------------

 (6 - 13)/12 = -7/12. So yes, 2a = -7/12,

---------------

 so a = -7/24.

Okay, so a = -7/24. Let's note that.



---------------

Now, let's use equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3

We can plug in

---------------

 a = -7/24 into this equation.

So, -(-7/24) + b - c = 1/3



---------------

Which is 7/24 + b - c = 1/3

Let me subtract 7/24 from both sides:

b - c = 1/3 - 7/24

Convert

---------------

 1/3 to 8/24, so 8/24 - 7/24 = 1/24



---------------

So, equation 5: b - c = 1/24

Similarly, let's use equation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4

Again

---------------

, plug in a = -7/24:

-(-7/24) - b + c = 1/4

Which

---------------

 is 7/24 - b + c = 1/4

Subtract 7/24 from both sides:

-

---------------

 b + c = 1/4 - 7/24

Convert 1/4 to 6/24:

---------------

 6/24 - 7/24 = -1/24

So, equation 6: -b + c = -1/24

Now

---------------

, we have equation 5: b - c = 1/24 and equation 6: -b + c = -1/24

Hmm

---------------

, let's add these two equations together:

(b - c) + (-b + c) = 1/24 + (-1/24)

Left

---------------

 side: 0 = 0

Hmm, that doesn't help. Maybe I can solve for one variable in terms of another.

From equation 5: b = c + 1/24

Plug

---------------

 this into equation 6:

- (c + 1/24) + c = -1/24

Simplify:



---------------

- c - 1/24 + c = -1/24

Which simplifies to -1/24 = -1/24



---------------

Hmm, so it's an identity, meaning that the two equations are dependent. So, I have infinitely many solutions? But

---------------

 wait, since we have three equations and three variables, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, but in equation 4,

---------------

 a + b + c = -13/12, and a is known as -7/24. So,

---------------

 let's plug a into equation 4.

Equation 4: (-7/24) + b + c = -13/12

So

---------------

, b + c = -13/12 + 7/24

Convert to 24 denominator: -26/24 + 7/24 = (-26 +7)/24 = (-19)/24

So, equation 7: b + c = -19/24

And

---------------

 from equation 5: b - c = 1/24

So now, equations 5 and 7:



---------------

Equation 5: b - c = 1/24

Equation 7: b + c = -19/24

Now

---------------

, I can solve these two equations together.

Adding them:

( b - c ) + (b + c ) = 1/24 + (-19)/24

Left

---------------

 side: 2b = (-18)/24 = -3/4

So, 2b = -3/4 => b = -3/8

Now

---------------

, plug b = -3/8 into equation 5: (-3/8) - c = 1/24

Wait

---------------

, equation 5 is b - c = 1/24, so:

(-3/8) - c = 1/24

Sub

---------------

tract (-3/8) from both sides:

- c = 1/24 + 3/8

Convert 3/8 to 9/24:



---------------

1/24 + 9/24 = 10/24 = 5/12

So, -c = 5/12 => c = -5/12

So

---------------

 now, we have a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12.

Let

---------------

 me verify these values in the original equations to make sure.

Equation 1: a - b - c = (-7/24) - (-3/8) - (-5/12)

Convert

---------------

 all to 24 denominator:

-7/24 + 9/24 + 10/24 = ( -7 + 9 + 10 ) /24 = 12/24 = 1/2.

---------------

 Correct.

Equation 2: -a + b - c = 7/24 + (-3/8) - (-5/12)

7

---------------

/24 - 9/24 + 10/24 = (7 -9 +10)/24 = 8/24 = 1/3. Correct.

Equation 3: -a - b + c = 7/24 - (-3/8) + (-5/12)

7/24 + 9/24 - 10/24 = (7 +9 -10)/24 =6/24=1/4. Correct.

So

---------------

, all equations are satisfied. Great.

Now, the next step is to find log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)

---------------

 which is 4a + 3b + 2c.

Let me compute that:

4a = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6

3b = 3*(-3/8) = -9/8

2c = 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6

So

---------------

, adding them all together:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6

First, let's combine the

---------------

 fractions with denominator 6: -7/6 -5/6 = (-12/6) = -2

So

---------------

 now, we have -2 -9/8.

Convert -2 to eighths: -16/8



---------------

So, -16/8 -9/8 = (-25)/8

So, log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = -25/8



---------------

The absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8.

So, m =25, n=8.

---------------

 Are they coprime? Yes, since 25 and 8 share no common divisors except 1.

So

---------------

, m +n=25+8=33.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{33}


Given the system of equations involving logarithms:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

We start

---------------

 by converting these logarithmic equations into linear equations using the properties of logarithms. Let \(a = \log_2 x\), \(b = \log_2 y\), and \(c = \log_2 z\). The equations become:

1. \(a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(-a + b - c = \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(-a - b + c = \frac{1}{4}\)

We also

---------------

 add all three equations to find:

\[
(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get \(-a - b - c\). The

---------------

 right side, with a common denominator of 12, is:

\[
\frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
-a - b - c = \frac{13}{12} \implies a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}
\]

Next

---------------

, we solve the system of equations. From equation 1 and equation 4, we find:

\[
2a = -\frac{7}{12} \implies a = -\frac{7}{24}
\]

Using \(

---------------

a = -\frac{7}{24}\) in equations 2 and 3, we solve for \(b\) and \(c\):

From equation 2:
\[
\frac{7}{24} + b - c = \frac{1}{3} \implies b - c = \frac{1}{24}
\]

From equation 3:
\[
\frac{7}{24} - b + c = \frac{1}{4} \implies -b + c = -\frac{1}{24}
\]

Adding

---------------

 these two results, we find \(b = -\frac{3}{8}\) and \(c = -\frac{5}{12}\).

Finally

---------------

, we compute \(\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\):

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 4\left(-\frac{7}{24}\right) + 3\left(-\frac{3}{8}\right) + 2\left(-\frac{5}{12}\right) = -\frac{7}{6} - \frac{9}{8} - \frac{5}{6}
\]

Con

---------------

verting to a common denominator:

\[
-\frac{28}{24} - \frac{27}{24} - \frac{20}{24} = -\frac{75}{24} = -\frac{25}{8}
\]

The absolute value is \(\left| -\frac{25}{8} \right| = \frac{25}{8}\). Thus, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), giving \(m + n = 33\).

\[
\boxed{33}
