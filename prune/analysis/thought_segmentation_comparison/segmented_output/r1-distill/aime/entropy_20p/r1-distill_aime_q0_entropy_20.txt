Okay, so I've got this problem here with logarithms and three variables: x, y, and z. They're

---------------

 all positive real numbers, which is good because logarithms of non-positive numbers aren't defined. The problem gives me three equations involving

---------------

 logarithms base 2, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), which

---------------

 will result in a fraction m/n. Then, I have to find m + n where m and n are coprime. 



---------------

Alright, let me write down the given equations:

1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

And

---------------

 the expression I need is |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|.

Hmm. So, I think I can

---------------

 convert these logarithmic equations into exponential form to make them easier to handle. Let me recall that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a.

So,

---------------

 applying that to each equation:

1. 2^(1/2) = x / (y z)
2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)
3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)

So

---------------

, now I have:

Equation 1: x = 2^(1/2) * y z

Equation 2: y = 2^(1/3) * x z

Equation 3: z = 2^(1/4) * x y

Hmm

---------------

, so now I have expressions for x, y, z in terms of the others. Maybe I can substitute these into each other to find expressions

---------------

 for x, y, z in terms of one variable.

Let me try to express everything in terms of x first.

From Equation 1: x = 2^(1/2) y z.

---------------

 Let me note that.

From Equation 2: y = 2^(1/3) x z. So, I

---------------

 can substitute this y into Equation 1.

So, substituting y into Equation 1: x = 2^(1/2) * (2^(1/3) x z) * z.



---------------

Simplify that:

x = 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) * x * z *

---------------

 z

Which is x = 2^(1/2 + 1/3) * x * z²

S

---------------

implify the exponents: 1/2 + 1/3 is 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6.



---------------

So, x = 2^(5/6) * x * z².

Hmm, I can divide both sides by x (

---------------

since x is positive, so it's not zero):

1 = 2^(5/6) * z²

So

---------------

, z² = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6)

Taking square roots:

---------------

 z = 2^(-5/12) since z is positive.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that

---------------

. 2^(-5/6) is z squared, so z is sqrt(2^(-5/6)) which

---------------

 is 2^(-5/12). Yeah, that's correct.

So, z = 2^(-5/12)



---------------

Alright, now that I have z, I can substitute back into Equation 3 to find x in terms of y, maybe

---------------

?

Wait, Equation 3: z = 2^(1/4) * x y.

Wait, but I just

---------------

 found z, so maybe I can express x in terms of y.

Wait, but I have z in terms of x and y,

---------------

 so maybe I can substitute z into Equation 3.

Wait, let me see. From Equation 3: z = 2^(1/4) x y.



---------------

But I found z = 2^(-5/12), so:

2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) x y

So

---------------

, 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/4) = x y

Simplify the

---------------

 exponents: 1/4 is 3/12, so 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3)

---------------

 = x y.

So, x y = 2^(-2/3)

Hmm, so x y = 2^(-2/3).

---------------

 I'll note that as Equation 4.

Now, let's go back to Equation 2: y = 2^(1/3) x z.

We

---------------

 know z is 2^(-5/12), so let's substitute that into Equation 2.

So, y = 2^(1/3) * x * 2^(-5/12)

S

---------------

implify the exponents: 1/3 is 4/12, so 4/12 -5/12 = -1/12.

So, y = 2^(4

---------------

/12 -5/12) x = 2^(-1/12) x.

So, y = 2^(-1/12) x.

So

---------------

, y is expressed in terms of x. Let me write that as Equation 5.

So, y = 2^(-1/12) x.

Now, plug

---------------

 this into Equation 4, which is x y = 2^(-2/3).

Substituting y:

x * [2^(-1/12) x] = 2^(-2/3)

So

---------------

, x^2 * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3)

So, x^2 = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3 + 1/12)

Convert

---------------

 to twelfths: -2/3 is -8/12, so -8/12 + 1/12 = -7/12.

So, x^2 = 2^(-7/12)

Taking

---------------

 square roots, x = 2^(-7/24) since x is positive.

Wait, wait. Let me check

---------------

:

2^(-7/12) is x squared, so x is sqrt(2^(-7/12)) =

---------------

 2^(-7/24). Yes, because sqrt(a^b) is a^(b/2).

So

---------------

, x = 2^(-7/24)

Now, from Equation 5: y = 2^(-1/12) x.



---------------

So, substituting x:

y = 2^(-1/12) * 2^(-7/24)

S

---------------

implify exponents: -1/12 is -2/24, so -2/24 -7/24 = -9/24 = -3/8.

Wait, no

---------------

. Wait, 2^(-1/12) is 2^(-2/24), and x is 2^(-7/24).

---------------

 So, adding exponents: -2/24 -7/24 = -9/24 = -3/8.

Wait

---------------

, but 1/12 is 2/24, so 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/24).

---------------

 So, yeah.

So, y = 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-3/8).



---------------

Wait, 9/24 is 3/8. So, y = 2^(-3/8).

Alright

---------------

, so now I have expressions for x, y, z:

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24)

z = 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24)

Wait

---------------

, let me write all in 24 denominators to make it easier:

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-9/24)

z = 2^(-10/24) =

---------------

 2^(-5/12)

Hmm, okay.

Now, the next step is to find log₂(x⁴ y³ z²).

---------------

 Let me compute that.

First, compute the exponents:

x⁴ = [2^(-7/24)]^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6)

y³ = [2^(-9/24)]^3 = 2^(-27/24) = 2^(-9/8)

z² = [2^(-10/24)]² = 2^(-20/24) = 2^(-5/6)

So

---------------

, multiplying these together:

x⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6)

Add

---------------

 exponents:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6

Let me find a common denominator, which is 24.

Convert each:



---------------

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

Adding

---------------

 them together: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24

So, x⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-75/24) = 2^(-25/8)

So

---------------

, log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = log₂(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.

Taking

---------------

 the absolute value: | -25/8 | = 25/8.

So, the value is 25/8. Since

---------------

 25 and 8 are coprime (no common factors besides 1), m is 25 and n is 8.

---------------

 Thus, m + n is 33.

Wait, let me double-check the exponents to make sure I didn't make a mistake.



---------------

x = 2^(-7/24). x^4 is 2^(-7/24 *4)

---------------

 = 2^(-7/6). Correct.

y = 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-3/8). y^3 is 2^(-9/8). Correct.

z = 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-5/12). z² is 2^(-5/6). Correct.

Adding

---------------

 exponents: (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6). Let me compute each as

---------------

 fractions:

Convert to 24ths:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

So

---------------

, total: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8.

---------------

 Yep, that's correct.

So, log₂ is -25/8. Absolute value is 25/8.

---------------

 So, m=25, n=8. 25+8=33.

I think that's solid

---------------

. Let me just check if I substituted correctly.

From Equation 1: x = 2^(1/2) y z.

---------------

 Let me plug in x, y, z.

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-9/24)

---------------

 = 2^(-3/8)

z = 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-5/12)

So

---------------

, 2^(1/2) y z = 2^(1/2) * 2^(-3/8) * 2^(-5/12)

Compute

---------------

 exponents:

1/2 is 12/24, -3/8 is -9/24, -5/12 is -10/24.

So

---------------

, adding: 12 -9 -10 = -7. So, 2^(-7/24).

---------------

 Which is x. Correct.

Similarly, check Equation 2: y = 2^(1/3) x z.

2

---------------

^(1/3) is 8/24 exponent? Wait, 1/3 is 8/24?

---------------

 Wait, 1/3 is 8/24? No, 1/3 is 8/24?

---------------

 Wait, 1/3 is 8/24? Wait, no. 1/3 is 8/24?

---------------

 8/24 is 1/3. Oh, yes, because 8/24 = 1/3.

So

---------------

, 2^(1/3) is 2^(8/24). Then x z is 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-17/24).



---------------

So, 2^(8/24) * 2^(-17/24) = 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-3/8)

---------------

 which is y. Correct.

Similarly, check Equation 3: z = 2^(1/4) x y.

2^(1/4) is 6/24 exponent

---------------

. x y is 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-16/24) = 2^(-2/3).

So, 2^(6/24) * 2^(-16/24) = 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-5/12) which is z. Correct.

So

---------------

, all equations are satisfied. Therefore, my earlier calculations are correct.

Therefore, the answer is 25/8, so

---------------

 m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.


To solve the given system of logarithmic equations, we start

---------------

 by converting each equation into exponential form:

1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\) implies \(x = 2^{1/2} \cdot yz\).
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\) implies \(y = 2^{1/3} \cdot xz\).
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\) implies \(z = 2^{1/4} \cdot xy\).

Sub

---------------

stituting \(y\) from the second equation into the first, we get:
\[
x = 2^{1/2} \cdot (2^{1/3} \cdot xz) \cdot z = 2^{5/6} \cdot x \cdot z^2.
\]
Dividing both sides by \(x\) and solving for \(z\), we find:
\[
z^2 = 2^{-5/6} \implies z = 2^{-5/12}.
\]

Substituting \(z\) into the third equation,

---------------

 we get:
\[
2^{-5/12} = 2^{1/4} \cdot x \cdot y \implies xy = 2^{-2/3}.
\]

Express

---------------

ing \(y\) in terms of \(x\) using the second equation:
\[
y = 2^{-1/12} \cdot x.
\]
Substituting this into \(xy = 2^{-2/3}\), we find

---------------

:
\[
x \cdot (2^{-1/12} \cdot x) = 2^{-2/3} \implies x^2 = 2^{-7/12} \implies x = 2^{-7/24}.
\]
Thus, \(y = 2^{-3/8}\).

Now, we compute \(\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\):
\[
x^4 = (2^{-7/24})^4 = 2^{-7/6}, \quad y^3 = (2^{-3/8})^3 = 2^{-9/8}, \quad z^2 = (2^{-5/12})^2 = 2^{-5/6}.
\]
Adding

---------------

 the exponents:
\[
-7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6 = -25/8.
\]
Thus, \(\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -25/8\), and its absolute value is \(25/8\). Therefore, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), giving \(m + n = 33\).

\[


---------------

\boxed{33}
