Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I have to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Hmm

---------------

, let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, let's parse the definition. A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:



---------------

1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

The

---------------

 example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (

---------------

since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is the

---------------

 square root of 81.

So, my goal is to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such numbers n that

---------------

 satisfy these conditions.

Let me try to formalize this. If n is a two-digit number in base b, that means in

---------------

 base 10, n can be expressed as:

n = a * b + c

where a and c are the digits in base b. Since

---------------

 it's a two-digit number, a must be at least 1 (since leading zeros aren't allowed), and both a and c must be less than b (

---------------

since in any base, digits go from 0 to base-1). So, 1 ≤ a < b and 0 ≤ c < b.

The

---------------

 second condition is that the sum of the digits a and c equals the square root of n. So,

a + c = sqrt(n)

But

---------------

 since n is a two-digit number in base b, n = a*b + c. So substituting, we get:

a + c = sqrt(a*b + c)

Let

---------------

 me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Expanding the left side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a*b + c

Let

---------------

 me rearrange this equation to group like terms:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0

Hmm

---------------

, maybe I can factor this or find a way to express it in terms of b.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write it

---------------

 as:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a*b + c

Let me bring all terms to one side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0

Hmm

---------------

, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I can factor in terms of b.

Let's see, the terms involving b are only

---------------

 -a*b. So, let's rearrange:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c = a*b

So

---------------

,

b = (a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c) / a

Simplify numerator:

a

---------------

^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c = a^2 + 2ac + c(c - 1)

Hmm

---------------

, but maybe I can factor it differently. Let me see:

Wait, a^2 + 2ac + c^2 is (a + c)^2.

---------------

 So,

b = [(a + c)^2 - c] / a

Because from earlier, (a + c)^2 = a*b + c,

---------------

 so a*b = (a + c)^2 - c, so b = [(a + c)^2 - c]/a

That

---------------

 seems useful. So, b = [ (a + c)^2 - c ] / a

Since b must be an integer greater

---------------

 than or equal to 2, and a and c are digits in base b, meaning 1 ≤ a < b and 0 ≤ c < b.

So

---------------

, for given a and c, b must be an integer, and must satisfy the digit constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write

---------------

 this as:

b = (a + c)^2 / a - c / a

But that might not be very helpful.

---------------

 Let me think of another approach.

Alternatively, since a and c are digits, a can range from 1 to b-1, and c can

---------------

 range from 0 to b-1. But since b is the base, and we are trying to find b, perhaps

---------------

 it's better to fix a and c and find possible b.

Wait, but the problem is to find the minimal b such

---------------

 that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. So perhaps for each b, I can count how many n satisfy the conditions

---------------

, and find the minimal b where this count exceeds ten.

So, the plan is:

1. For each base b starting from 2 upwards:


---------------

   a. For each a from 1 to b-1 (since a is the first digit in base b, two

---------------

-digit number):
      i. For each c from 0 to b-1:
         - Check if a + c =

---------------

 sqrt(n), where n = a*b + c
         - So, sqrt(n) must be an integer, because a + c is integer

---------------

.
         - So, n must be a perfect square.

So, n is a perfect square, and n = a*b + c.

---------------

 Also, a + c = sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) must be equal to a + c.

Let me denote

---------------

 s = a + c. Then, s must be equal to sqrt(n), so n = s^2.

Also, since

---------------

 n = a*b + c, we have:

s^2 = a*b + c

But since s = a + c, we

---------------

 can substitute c = s - a into the equation:

s^2 = a*b + (s - a)

Simplify:

s^2 = a*b + s - a

Bring

---------------

 all terms to one side:

s^2 - s = a*b - a

Factor the right side:

s^2 - s = a*(b - 1)

So

---------------

,

a = (s^2 - s) / (b - 1)

Since a must be an integer, (

---------------

s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). Also, since a must satisfy 1 ≤ a < b, this

---------------

 gives constraints on s and b.

Wait, but perhaps I can solve for b in terms of s and a.

From the

---------------

 equation:

s^2 = a*b + (s - a)

So,

a*b = s^2 - s + a

Thus

---------------

,

b = (s^2 - s + a)/a

Simplify:

b = (s^2 - s)/a + 1

So

---------------

,

b = (s(s - 1))/a + 1

Hmm, this might be a better way to express

---------------

 it.

So, for given s and a, b must be equal to (s(s - 1))/a + 1.



---------------

But since b must be an integer, (s(s - 1)) must be divisible by a.

Also, since a must

---------------

 be at least 1 and less than b, which is (s(s - 1))/a + 1, so

---------------

 a must be less than that.

Moreover, since c = s - a, and c must be less than b, we

---------------

 have:

c = s - a < b

So,

s - a < (s(s - 1))/a + 1

This

---------------

 is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I can approach this differently.

Let me consider s as a positive integer, since s = a + c,

---------------

 and a and c are digits, so s must be at least 1 (if a=1, c=0)

---------------

 and at most (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2. But since n

---------------

 is a two-digit number in base b, n is less than b^2, so s^2 < b^2,

---------------

 which implies s < b. So, s can range from 1 to b-1.

Wait, that's an important point. Since n is

---------------

 a two-digit number in base b, n is between b (inclusive) and b^2 (exclusive). So, n

---------------

 = s^2, which must be ≥ b and < b^2. Therefore, s must satisfy sqrt(b) ≤ s < b.

But

---------------

 s is an integer, so s can range from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1.

So, for each base b, s

---------------

 can take integer values from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1.

For each such s, we can find the possible a and

---------------

 c.

From earlier, we have:

s^2 = a*b + c

And s = a + c, so c = s - a.

Substituting into

---------------

 the equation:

s^2 = a*b + (s - a)

Which simplifies to:

s^2 = a*(

---------------

b - 1) + s

Then,

a*(b - 1) = s^2 - s

So

---------------

,

a = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1)

Since a must be a positive integer, (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1).

---------------

 Also, a must be at least 1 and less than b.

So, for a given b, s can be from

---------------

 ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1. For each s, check if (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1). If it

---------------

 is, then a = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1). Then, check if a is an integer,

---------------

 1 ≤ a < b, and c = s - a is also less than b (since c < b as a digit in

---------------

 base b).

So, for each b, we can iterate s from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1, compute a

---------------

 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1), check if a is integer, and if so, check the

---------------

 constraints on a and c.

If all conditions are met, then n = s^2 is a b-eautiful number.

So

---------------

, the plan is:

For each base b starting from 2 upwards:

1. For each s from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1:



---------------

   a. Compute numerator = s^2 - s

   b. If numerator is divisible by (b-1), then

---------------

 compute a = numerator / (b-1)

   c. Check if a is an integer (which it will be if step

---------------

 b is satisfied), and 1 ≤ a < b.

   d. Compute c = s - a.

   e. Check if c is an

---------------

 integer between 0 and b-1.

   f. If all conditions are satisfied, then count this n = s^2 as a b-eautiful number.

2

---------------

. After checking all s for a given b, count how many b-eautiful numbers exist.

3. Find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.

This

---------------

 seems manageable, but doing this manually for each b might be tedious. Perhaps I can find a pattern or formula to compute the number of b

---------------

-eautiful numbers for a given b.

Let me try to find a relationship between s and a for a given b.

We

---------------

 have:

a = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1)

Let me denote k = b - 1.

---------------

 Then, a = (s^2 - s)/k.

So, for each b, k = b -1,

---------------

 and s must be such that (s^2 - s) is divisible by k.

Also, since s ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1, which

---------------

 is s from ceil(sqrt(k+1)) to k.

So, for each k, s ranges from ceil(sqrt(k+1)) to k.

We

---------------

 can write:

a = (s^2 - s)/k

Which can be rewritten as:

a = s(s - 1)/k

Since

---------------

 a must be integer, s(s-1) must be divisible by k.

But s and s-1 are consecutive integers, so they are coprime. Therefore

---------------

, k must divide the product s(s - 1). Since s and s -1 are coprime, k must divide

---------------

 either s or s -1.

So, for each k, s must be such that either:

1. k divides s, or

2. k divides (s - 1)

But

---------------

 since s ranges up to k, let's see:

Case 1: k divides s.

But s ≤ k, so s

---------------

 can be k. But s ranges up to k, so s = k is possible. Then, a = (k^2 -k)/k = k -1.



---------------

But a must be less than b = k + 1, so a = k -1 < k +1, which is true

---------------

.

Case 2: k divides (s -1)

Then, s -1 must be a multiple of k. Since

---------------

 s ≤ k, s -1 can be at most k -1. So the only possibility is s -1 = 0,

---------------

 i.e., s = 1. But s starts from ceil(sqrt(k+1)), which is at least 2 for

---------------

 k ≥3. So s=1 is not in the range. Hence, case 2 only applies when s=1, which is not

---------------

 in our range for s. Therefore, only case 1 is applicable, where k divides s.

Wait, but when s=

---------------

1, s-1=0, which is divisible by k, but s=1 is only possible when sqrt(k+1) ≤1, which

---------------

 is when k+1 ≤1, so k ≤0, but k = b-1 ≥1 (since b≥2). So s

---------------

=1 is not in the range. Therefore, only case 1 is possible.

Wait, but that can't be right

---------------

 because in the example given, 81 is 13-eautiful. Let's check that.

In that case, b=13, so k=12.

s

---------------

 = a + c = 6 + 3 =9.

So, s=9.

Compute a = (9^2 -9)/12 = (81 -9)/12=72/12=6.



---------------

Which is valid.

But 12 divides 72, which is s(s-1)=9*8=72.



---------------

So, 12 divides 72, which is true.

But 12 doesn't divide s=9,

---------------

 but 12 divides s(s-1)=72.

Wait, so my earlier conclusion that k must divide s or s-1 is

---------------

 incorrect because in this case, 12 divides 72, which is s(s-1), but 12 doesn't divide s=

---------------

9 or s-1=8. So, perhaps my earlier reasoning was flawed.

Wait, perhaps since s and s-1 are coprime, k

---------------

 must divide either s or s-1. But in this case, 12 divides 72, which is s

---------------

(s-1). Since 72=8*9, and 12=4*3. Hmm, but

---------------

 12 divides 72, but 12 doesn't divide 8 or 9. So, my earlier

---------------

 conclusion that k must divide s or s-1 is incorrect.

Wait, that's a mistake. Because s and s-1 are coprime, any

---------------

 divisor of s(s-1) must divide s or s-1. But wait, no, that's not necessarily the

---------------

 case. For example, 6 divides 2*3, but 6 doesn't divide 2 or 3.

---------------

 So, my earlier conclusion is wrong. So, I need to correct that.

So, if s and s-1 are coprime, then

---------------

 any divisor of s(s-1) can be a product of a divisor of s and a divisor of s-1. So

---------------

, k can be any divisor of s(s-1), not necessarily a divisor of s or s-1.

Therefore, for

---------------

 each k, s can be any integer in the range [ceil(sqrt(k+1)), k] such that k divides s(s-1).

So

---------------

, for each k, the number of valid s is equal to the number of s in that range where k divides s(s-1).

Hmm

---------------

, this complicates things because for each k, I need to find s in [ceil(sqrt(k+1)),k] such that s(s-1) is

---------------

 divisible by k.

But perhaps we can think of it differently. For each k, the possible s are such that s ≡ 0 or 1 mod factors

---------------

 of k. But this might be getting too abstract.

Alternatively, perhaps for each k, the number of valid s is equal to the number of div

---------------

isors of k, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the equation:

k divides s(s - 1)



---------------

Which is equivalent to s(s - 1) ≡ 0 mod k.

So, for each s in [ceil(sqrt(k+1)),k], check

---------------

 if s(s-1) is divisible by k.

The number of such s for each k will determine the number of b

---------------

-eautiful numbers for base b = k +1.

So, the problem reduces to, for each k starting from 1 (

---------------

since b starts from 2), count the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(k+1)),k] such that s(s -1) is

---------------

 divisible by k. Then, for each b =k +1, the count is equal to the number of such s.



---------------

We need to find the smallest b such that this count exceeds 10.

So, perhaps I can compute this count for increasing

---------------

 k until I find the first k where the count is >10, then b =k +1.

This seems manageable

---------------

, but it's going to take some time.

Let me start with small k and compute the count.

Let me make a table:



---------------

k | b=k+1 | s_min=ceil(sqrt(k+1)) | s_max=k | Number of s where k divides

---------------

 s(s-1)
---|-------|-------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------
1 | 2     | ceil(sqrt(2))=2         |1       | s

---------------

 ranges from 2 to1, which is invalid. So 0
2 |3      | ceil(sqrt(3))=2         |2       | s

---------------

=2: check if 2 divides 2*1=2: yes. So count=1

So

---------------

 for k=30, count=7

Wait, that's a jump. So for k=30, the

---------------

 count is 7, which is more than 10? No, 7 is less than 10. So

---------------

 we need to continue.

But this is taking a lot of time. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute

---------------

 the count more efficiently.

Looking back, for k from 1 to 30, the counts are mostly 1 or 3, except

---------------

 for k=2, which had count=1, and k=30 which had count=7.

Wait, let

---------------

's see:

Looking at k=30, which is 30, the count was 7. So, perhaps

---------------

 when k is highly composite, the count increases.

Wait, for k=30, which is 2*3*5, the

---------------

 number of s where 30 divides s(s-1) is higher.

In general, for a given k, the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(k+1)),k] such that k divides s(s-1)

---------------

 is equal to the number of divisors of k that are less than or equal to k and satisfy s(s-1) divisible

---------------

 by k.

But perhaps a better approach is to note that s(s-1) must be a multiple of k. So, s

---------------

 must be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo the prime factors of k.

Alternatively, since s and s-1 are coprime, for

---------------

 each prime p dividing k, p must divide either s or s-1.

So, for each prime p dividing k, we

---------------

 can assign p to divide either s or s-1. This is similar to the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

Therefore, the number of possible

---------------

 s is 2^m, where m is the number of distinct prime factors of k. But this is only if each

---------------

 prime can independently divide either s or s-1, which may not always be the case.

Wait, but for example, for

---------------

 k=30=2*3*5, the number of possible s is 2^3=8. But in

---------------

 our earlier calculation, for k=30, the count was 7. Hmm, so perhaps it's 2^m -1,

---------------

 but not sure.

Wait, for k=30, the s values that worked were:

s=6,10,15,16,21,25,30.



---------------

Which is 7 values. So, 2^3 -1=7, which matches.

Similarly, for k=6

---------------

=2*3, the number of s was 3, which is 2^2 -1=3.

For

---------------

 k=12=2^2*3, the number of s was 3, which is less than 2^2=4.



---------------

Hmm, maybe the formula is not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of s is equal to the number of divisors of k that

---------------

 are ≤ s_max and satisfy s ≡0 or 1 mod the prime factors.

But I'm not sure. Maybe

---------------

 it's better to think in terms of multiplicative functions.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions s for a given k is equal to the

---------------

 number of ways to assign each prime factor of k to either s or s-1, leading to 2^m solutions

---------------

, where m is the number of distinct prime factors. But in the case where k has repeated prime factors, like k=4=2^2, the

---------------

 number of solutions is less.

Wait, for k=4, which is 2^2, the number of s was 1 (

---------------

s=4). But 2^1=2, which is more than 1.

Hmm, perhaps the formula isn

---------------

't straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions s is equal to the number of divisors of k that are ≤k

---------------

 and satisfy s ≡0 or 1 mod the exponents.

But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I can think

---------------

 differently.

Each s must satisfy s ≡0 mod d or s ≡1 mod d, where d is a divisor of k. But

---------------

 since d can be any divisor, it's complicated.

Alternatively, for each s in [ceil(sqrt(k+1)),k], check if k

---------------

 divides s(s-1). If yes, count it.

But this is computationally intensive, but perhaps manageable for small k.

Given

---------------

 that, let's proceed.

Continuing from where I left off with k=30:

k=30, count=7 (

---------------

for b=31)

k=31 |32| ceil(sqrt(32))=6 |31|

s=47:47*46=2162, 50 doesn't divide 2162. No.

s=48:48*47=2256, 50 doesn't divide 2256. No.

s=49:49*48=2352, 50 doesn't divide 2352. No.

s=50:50*49=2450, 50 divides 2450. Yes. Count=7

So for k=50, count=7

So

---------------

 for b=51, the count is 7.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the least b where the count exceeds 10. So

---------------

 far, the maximum count I've found is 7 for k=30 (b=31), k=42 (b=43), and k=50 (b=51).

Wait

---------------

, maybe I need to go further.

Let me try k=60:

Wait, but this is getting tedious. Maybe

---------------

 I can find a pattern or mathematical formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think that when k is a multiple of many numbers, the

---------------

 count increases.

But perhaps the count increases when k is a factorial or a highly composite number.

Alternatively, let's consider that

---------------

 the number of solutions s for a given k is equal to the number of divisors d of k such that d ≤ k

---------------

 and d divides s(s-1). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the equation:

s(s - 1) ≡ 0 mod k

Which implies

---------------

 that s ≡ 0 mod d or s ≡ 1 mod d for each prime power d dividing k.

But

---------------

 this is getting too abstract.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions s is equal to 2^m, where m is the number of distinct prime factors of k.

---------------

 But earlier, for k=30 (which has m=3), the count was 7, which is less than 2^3=8.

Wait

---------------

, perhaps it's 2^m -1.

For k=30, m=3, 2^3 -1=7, which matches.

For k=6,

---------------

 m=2, 2^2 -1=3, which matches.

For k=12, which has m=2 (since

---------------

 12=2^2*3), the count was 3, which is 2^2 -1=3.

Similarly

---------------

, for k=30, count=7=2^3 -1.

k=60=2^2*3*5, m=3, so

---------------

 count=2^3 -1=7.

Wait, but for k=60, would the count be 7?

Let

---------------

 me test k=60.

k=60 |61| ceil(sqrt(61))=8 |60|

s=60:60*59=3540, 60 divides 3540. Yes. Count=7

So for k=60, count=7



---------------

Hmm, so even for k=60, which has more factors, the count is still 7.

Wait, maybe

---------------

 I need to find a k where the number of divisors is high enough that the count exceeds 10.

Alternatively, perhaps the

---------------

 count increases as k increases, but it's not guaranteed.

Wait, let me think about the formula.

From earlier, for

---------------

 a given k, the number of s is equal to the number of solutions to s(s-1) ≡0 mod k,

---------------

 where s is in [ceil(sqrt(k+1)),k].

This is equivalent to finding s such that s ≡0 or 1 mod each

---------------

 prime power dividing k.

So, for each prime power p^e dividing k, s must be ≡0 or 1 mod p^e.

The

---------------

 number of solutions is the product over all prime powers dividing k of (number of choices for each p^e).

For each prime power p^e,

---------------

 there are 2 choices: s ≡0 or 1 mod p^e.

However, since the moduli are not

---------------

 coprime (as they may share primes), the Chinese Remainder Theorem doesn't directly apply.

But if k is square-free, the

---------------

 number of solutions is 2^m, where m is the number of distinct prime factors.

But in our case, k

---------------

 is not necessarily square-free.

Wait, but even so, for k=30=2*3*5, which

---------------

 is square-free, the number of solutions is 2^3 -1=7.

Similarly, for k=6=2*3, the

---------------

 number of solutions is 3=2^2 -1.

So perhaps the formula is 2^m -1,

---------------

 where m is the number of distinct prime factors.

If that's the case, then for k=30, m=3, count

---------------

=7.

For k=60=2^2*3*5, m=3, count=7.



---------------

Wait, but 60 has m=3, same as 30, but the count is still 7.

So

---------------

 perhaps the count is 2^m -1 regardless of exponents.

If that's the case, then to get a

---------------

 count exceeding 10, we need 2^m -1 >10, so 2^m >11,

---------------

 so m≥4.

So, for k with m=4 distinct prime factors, the count would be 2^4 -1=15.



---------------

Therefore, the minimal k with m=4 would be the product of the first four primes: 2*3*5*7=210.

But

---------------

 210 is quite large, so the corresponding b would be 211.

But perhaps there's a smaller k with m=4.



---------------

Wait, the smallest k with m=4 is indeed 210.

But let me check.

Wait, 2*3*5*7=210.

Yes

---------------

, that's the smallest number with four distinct prime factors.

So, for k=210, the count would be 2^4 -1=15.



---------------

Thus, for b=211, the count would be 15, which is more than 10.

But perhaps

---------------

 there's a smaller k where the count exceeds 10.

Wait, perhaps for k=120=2^3*3*5, which has m=3,

---------------

 but higher exponents.

But according to our earlier formula, count=2^3 -1=7.

So, even

---------------

 with higher exponents, the count remains the same.

So, the count depends only on the number of distinct prime factors.



---------------

Therefore, the minimal k with m=4 is 210, leading to b=211.

But wait

---------------

, let's test this.

For k=210, the number of solutions s would be 2^4 -1=15.

But

---------------

 is that accurate?

Alternatively, perhaps the count is 2^m, not 2^m -1.

Wait, for

---------------

 k=6=2*3, m=2, and count=3=2^2 -1.

For k=30=2*3*5, m=3, count=7=2^3 -1.

For

---------------

 k=210=2*3*5*7, m=4, count=15=2^4 -1.

So

---------------

, the formula seems to hold.

Therefore, the count for k is 2^m -1, where m is the number of distinct prime factors.

Thus

---------------

, to have count >10, we need 2^m -1>10 → 2^m>11 → m≥4.

Thus

---------------

, the smallest k with m=4 is 210.

Therefore, the corresponding b is 211.

But

---------------

 wait, is 210 the minimal k with m=4? Let me check.

Yes, because the next possible

---------------

 k would be 2*3*5*7=210.

So, the minimal b is 211.

But wait

---------------

, in our earlier calculations, for k=30 (b=31), the count was 7, which is

---------------

 less than 10.

Similarly, for k=60 (b=61), count=7.

So, unless

---------------

 there's a k with m=4 before 210, which I don't think exists, the minimal b is 211.

But let

---------------

 me think again.

Wait, 2*3*5*7=210, which is the smallest number with four distinct prime factors.

Thus

---------------

, the minimal b is 211.

But wait, in the problem statement, it's stated that the example is 

---------------

81 is 13-eautiful because 81=6*13 +3, and 6+3=9=

---------------

√81.

So, in that case, k=12, which is 13-1=12.



---------------

k=12 has m=2 (prime factors 2 and 3), so the count is 3, which matches

---------------

 our earlier count for k=12.

Thus, the formula seems to hold.

Therefore, the minimal b is 211.



---------------

But wait, 211 is quite large. The problem might have a smaller b.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming

---------------

 the count is 2^m -1.

Let me think again.

In the case of k=30, which

---------------

 is 2*3*5, m=3, count=7=2^3 -1.

Similarly, for k=60

---------------

=2^2*3*5, m=3, count=7.

But what about k=105=3*5*7, m=3, count=7.

Thus

---------------

, the count depends only on m, not on the exponents.

Thus, to get count>10, we need m=

---------------

4.

Therefore, the minimal k is 210, leading to b=211.

But I'm not

---------------

 sure if this is correct because in the earlier examples, the counts were lower.

Wait, perhaps I can find a smaller k with

---------------

 m=4.

Wait, the next number after 210 with m=4 is 2*3*5*7=210.

Wait

---------------

, no, 210 is the first.

So, I think the minimal b is 211.

But I

---------------

'm not entirely confident because perhaps the count isn't exactly 2^m -1.

Alternatively, perhaps the count is 

---------------

2^m.

Wait, for k=6, m=2, count=3=2^2 -1.

For

---------------

 k=30, m=3, count=7=2^3 -1.

So, the formula holds.

Thus, to

---------------

 get count>10, we need 2^m -1>10 → m≥4.

Thus, the

---------------

 minimal k with m=4 is 210.

Therefore, the minimal b is 211.

But wait

---------------

, let me check for k=105=3*5*7, m=3, count=7.

Similarly

---------------

, k=165=3*5*11, m=3, count=7.

So, no

---------------

, there's no smaller k with m=4.

Thus, the minimal b is 211.

But in the problem

---------------

 statement, the example is b=13, which corresponds to k=12, which has m=2, count=3.

So

---------------

, the formula seems to hold.

Therefore, the minimal b is 211.

But wait, let me think again

---------------

.

Wait, perhaps for some k with m=4, the count could be higher.

Wait, no, the count is 

---------------

2^m -1, so for m=4, it's 15.

Thus, the minimal b is 211.

But

---------------

 I'm not sure if this is correct because I haven't seen any b less than 211 with more than 10 b

---------------

-eautiful numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, let's think differently.

The number of solutions s is

---------------

 equal to the number of ways to assign each prime factor of k to either s or s-1.

Thus, for each prime p

---------------

 dividing k, s can be ≡0 or 1 mod p.

Thus, the number of solutions is 2^m, where m is the number of distinct prime factors.

But since

---------------

 s must satisfy all these congruences simultaneously, the total number of solutions is 2^m.

However, some solutions may not

---------------

 satisfy s ≤k or other constraints.

Wait, but in our earlier examples, for k=6=2*3, m=2, the

---------------

 count was 3, which is less than 2^2=4.

Similarly, for k=30=2*3*5, m=3, count=7 <

---------------

8.

So, perhaps the formula is 2^m -1.

Thus, to get count>10, m

---------------

=4 gives count=15.

Thus, the minimal b is 211.

But I'm not entirely confident

---------------

, but given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this conclusion.


The least integer \( b \geq 2 \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful integers is **

---------------

211**.
