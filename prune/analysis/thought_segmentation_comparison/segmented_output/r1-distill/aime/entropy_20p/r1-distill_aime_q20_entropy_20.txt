Okay, so I have this math problem here about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. Let me try to wrap my head around it.



---------------

The problem says that for a given integer b (which is at least 2), a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met.

---------------

 First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. 



---------------

The example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because when you write 81 in base 13, it's 63

---------------

 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is sqrt(81). That

---------------

 makes sense.

The task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, I

---------------

 need to figure out for each base b, how many numbers n satisfy the two conditions, and find the smallest b where this count exceeds ten.

Let

---------------

 me break it down. First, let's understand what it means for a number n to have exactly two digits in base b. In base b, the two

---------------

-digit numbers range from b^1 to b^2 - 1. Specifically, a two-digit number in base b is of

---------------

 the form d1*d2, where d1 is the first digit (from the left) and d2 is the second digit. Here

---------------

, d1 can be from 1 to b-1, and d2 can be from 0 to b-1. So, n

---------------

 can be written as d1 * b + d2.

The second condition is that the sum of these two digits, d1 + d2, equals

---------------

 sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) must be an integer because d1 and d2 are integers, right? Because sqrt

---------------

(n) is the sum of two integers, it must itself be an integer. Therefore, n must be a perfect square.

Wait

---------------

, that's an important point. So n is a perfect square, and in base b, it's a two-digit number.

---------------

 So, n = k^2, where k is an integer, and n is in the range [b, b^2 - 1].

---------------

 So, k must be such that b ≤ k^2 ≤ b^2 - 1.

Also, since n is a

---------------

 two-digit number in base b, n = d1*b + d2, where d1 is between 1 and b-1, and d2 is between 0 and b-1. So

---------------

, d1 + d2 = k.

So, putting it all together, we have:

1. n = k^2


---------------

2. n = d1*b + d2
3. d1 + d2 = k
4. 1 ≤ d1 ≤ b-1
5. 0 ≤ d2 ≤ b-1

So

---------------

, substituting equation 3 into equation 2:

k^2 = d1*b + (k - d1)

---------------

  [since d2 = k - d1]

Simplify that:

k^2 = d1*b + k - d1



---------------

Bring all terms to one side:

k^2 - k = d1*(b - 1)

So, d1 = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1)

Hmm

---------------

, so d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1. Therefore, (k^2 - k) must be divisible by (b - 1), and the result must

---------------

 be an integer between 1 and b-1.

So, (k^2 - k) mod (b - 1) =

---------------

 0, and 1 ≤ (k^2 - k)/(b - 1) ≤ b-1.

Let

---------------

 me denote m = b - 1. Then, d1 = (k^2 - k)/m, and 

---------------

1 ≤ d1 ≤ m.

So, m must be a divisor of k(k - 1). Also, d1 must

---------------

 be between 1 and m.

So, for each base b, m = b - 1, and we can find

---------------

 all k such that m divides k(k - 1), and d1 = (k^2 - k)/m is between

---------------

 1 and m.

Moreover, n = k^2 must be a two-digit number in base b, so n must

---------------

 be between b and b^2 - 1.

So, b ≤ k^2 ≤ b^2 - 1.



---------------

But since b = m + 1, we can write this as:

m + 1 ≤ k^2 ≤ (m + 1)^2 - 1.



---------------

Expanding (m+1)^2 -1:

(m + 1)^2 - 1 = m^2 + 2m + 1 -1 = m^2 + 2m.

So, m

---------------

 + 1 ≤ k^2 ≤ m^2 + 2m.

Taking square roots:

sqrt(m + 1) ≤ k ≤ sqrt(m^2 + 2m).

But

---------------

 sqrt(m^2 + 2m) is approximately m + 1, but let's compute it exactly:

sqrt(m^2 + 2m) = m *

---------------

 sqrt(1 + 2/m) ≈ m + 1 for large m, but for exactness, perhaps it

---------------

's better to keep it as is.

But wait, let's see. For each m, which is b - 1, we

---------------

 need to find k such that:

1. m divides k(k - 1)
2. 1 ≤ d1 = (k^2 - k)/m ≤ m
3. m

---------------

 + 1 ≤ k^2 ≤ m^2 + 2m

Wait, that's a lot of conditions. Maybe

---------------

 I can approach this differently.

Let me try to think about the possible values of k for a given m. Since k^

---------------

2 must be a two-digit number in base b, which is m + 1, so k^2 must be between

---------------

 m + 1 and (m + 1)^2 - 1.

Which is the same as:

sqrt(m + 1) ≤ k ≤ sqrt(m

---------------

^2 + 2m).

But sqrt(m^2 + 2m) is sqrt(m(m + 2)),

---------------

 which is between m and m + 1.

Wait, actually, let's compute sqrt(m^2 + 2m).

---------------

 Let me consider m^2 + 2m = (m + 1)^2 -1. So, sqrt(m^2 + 2m) = sqrt((m + 1)^2 -1)

---------------

 < m + 1.

So, k must be an integer such that:

sqrt(m + 1) ≤ k ≤ m +

---------------

 1 - ε, where ε is a small positive number.

But since k must be integer, the maximum k is m.



---------------

Wait, let's see:

Wait, (m + 1)^2 = m^2 + 2m + 1,

---------------

 so (m + 1)^2 - 1 = m^2 + 2m.

So, k^2 must

---------------

 be ≤ m^2 + 2m, so k ≤ sqrt(m^2 + 2m) < m + 1.



---------------

Therefore, k can be at most m.

Wait, because k is integer, so k ≤ m.

Similarly, the lower bound:

---------------

 k ≥ sqrt(m + 1).

So, for each m, k can range from ceil(sqrt(m + 1)) up to m.

But

---------------

 k must also satisfy that m divides k(k - 1), and that d1 = (k^2 - k)/m is between

---------------

 1 and m.

Wait, but since d1 = (k^2 -k)/m, and m divides k(k -1), so

---------------

 d1 is an integer.

Additionally, since d1 must be at least 1, we have:

(k^2 - k)/m ≥ 1 ⇒

---------------

 k^2 - k ≥ m.

But m = b - 1, and b = m +1. So, k

---------------

^2 -k ≥ m.

But since k can be up to m, let's substitute k = m:

m^2 - m ≥ m ⇒ m^2 - 2m ≥ 0 ⇒ m(m - 2) ≥ 0.



---------------

So, for m ≥ 2, this holds. For m =1, m^2 - 2m =1

---------------

 -2= -1 <0. So, for m=1, k^2 -k must be ≥1.

---------------

 So, for m=1, k^2 -k ≥1. But k can be up to m=1,

---------------

 so k=1: 1 -1=0, which is less than 1. So, m=1 has

---------------

 no solutions. So, for m=1, no b-eautiful numbers.

But let's not get bogged down here

---------------

. Let me try to think about how to model this.

For each m ≥1, we can find the number of k

---------------

's such that:

1. m divides k(k -1)
2. 1 ≤ (k^2 -k)/m ≤ m
3. ceil

---------------

(sqrt(m +1)) ≤k ≤ m

And then, for each m, count the number of such k's,

---------------

 which would correspond to the number of b-eautiful numbers for b = m +1.

We need to find the smallest m +

---------------

1 such that the count exceeds ten.

So, perhaps we can approach this by iterating over m starting from 1 upwards, for

---------------

 each m, compute the number of valid k's, and find the smallest m where this count is >10.

But

---------------

 doing this manually for each m might be time-consuming, so maybe I can find a pattern or a formula.

Let me think

---------------

: m divides k(k -1). Since m = b -1, and k is in the range [ceil(sqrt(m +1)), m].



---------------

Given that m divides k(k -1), which is two consecutive integers, so k and k-1 are coprime.

---------------

 Therefore, m must be a product of two factors, one dividing k and the other dividing k-1.

So, m

---------------

 can be factored into two coprime factors, say, a and b, such that a divides k and b divides k -1,

---------------

 and a*b = m.

Therefore, for each m, the number of solutions k is equal to the number of ways to write

---------------

 m as a product of two coprime factors a and b, with a ≤ b, and then solving for k ≡ 0 mod a and k ≡1 mod b.

But

---------------

 since k is in the range [ceil(sqrt(m +1)), m], perhaps for each factorization of m into a*b,

---------------

 coprime, we can find the number of solutions for k in that range.

Wait, this seems a bit abstract, but maybe

---------------

 manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that since m divides k(k -1), then k ≡0 or 1 mod m

---------------

's factors.

Wait, perhaps not. Maybe let's think about m as a product of primes.

Alternatively, perhaps for each m, the

---------------

 number of k's is equal to the number of divisors d of m such that d divides k and (m/d) divides (k -1),

---------------

 or vice versa. Since m = a*b, with a and b coprime, then for each such pair, we

---------------

 can solve the congruence k ≡0 mod a and k ≡1 mod b.

But I think this is

---------------

 getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps for each m, the number of k's is equal to the number of divisors t

---------------

 of m such that t ≤ k and (m/t) divides (k -1).

Wait, maybe I should think about

---------------

 the equation d1 = (k^2 -k)/m.

Since d1 must be between 1 and m, we

---------------

 have:

1 ≤ (k^2 -k)/m ≤ m.

So,

m ≤ k^2 -k ≤ m^2.

Which

---------------

 can be rewritten as:

k^2 -k -m ≥0,

and

k^2 -k -m^2 ≤0.

So

---------------

, solving k^2 -k -m ≥0:

Using quadratic formula:

k = [1 ± sqrt(1 +4m)]/2.

Since

---------------

 k is positive, we take the positive root:

k ≥ [1 + sqrt(1 +4m)]/2.

Similarly, solving

---------------

 k^2 -k -m^2 ≤0:

k ≤ [1 + sqrt(1 +4m^2)]/2.

But

---------------

 since m is positive, sqrt(1 +4m^2) is approximately 2m, so [1 + sqrt

---------------

(1 +4m^2)]/2 ≈ m + 1/(4m), which is just a bit more

---------------

 than m. So, since k must be integer, k ≤ m.

So, k must satisfy:

ceil([1 + sqrt(1 +4m)]/2) ≤k ≤m.

Additionally

---------------

, m divides k(k -1). So, for each m, we can iterate k from that lower bound to m, and check if m divides k(k -1).

---------------

 The number of such k's would be the number of b-eautiful numbers for base b = m +1.

So, perhaps

---------------

 the way to proceed is to iterate m starting from 1 upwards, for each m, compute the lower bound for k,

---------------

 then iterate k from that lower bound up to m, and count how many k's satisfy m divides k(k -1). Then

---------------

, for each m, if the count exceeds 10, we can note the corresponding b = m +1 as a

---------------

 candidate.

But since the problem is asking for the minimal b where the count exceeds ten, I need to find the smallest m +

---------------

1 where the count is >10.

But doing this manually for each m is going to take a lot of time. Maybe

---------------

 I can find a pattern or a formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of k's for a given m is equal to the number of divisors of m.

---------------

 Wait, not exactly, because it's not just any divisor, but a pair of coprime divisors.

Wait, considering

---------------

 that m divides k(k -1), and since k and k -1 are coprime, m must be a product of two coprime factors

---------------

, one dividing k, the other dividing k -1.

Therefore, for each pair of coprime divisors (a, b) of

---------------

 m with a*b = m, there is a unique solution modulo m to the system:

k ≡0 mod a,

k ≡1 mod b.

By

---------------

 the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since a and b are coprime, there is a unique solution modulo m.

Therefore

---------------

, for each such pair (a, b), there is exactly one k modulo m that satisfies these conditions. But since we are

---------------

 looking for k in the range [ceil([1 + sqrt(1 +4m)]/2), m], the number of solutions

---------------

 depends on whether this k falls within that interval.

But this is getting a bit too abstract. Maybe an example would help.

Take m =6

---------------

 (so b=7). Let's compute the number of k's.

First, compute the lower bound for k:

sqrt

---------------

(m +1) = sqrt(7) ≈ 2.645, so ceil(2.645) =3.

So

---------------

 k ranges from 3 to 6.

Now, for each k from 3 to6, check if 6 divides k(k -1).

k

---------------

=3: 3*2=6, which is divisible by6. So yes. So d1=(9 -3)/6=6/6=1.

---------------

 Which is valid since d1=1.

k=4:4*3=12, which is divisible by6. d

---------------

1=(16-4)/6=12/6=2, which is valid.

k=5:5*4=20, which

---------------

 is not divisible by6 (20/6=3.333). So no.

k=6:6*5=30, which is divisible by6. d1=(36 -6)/6=30/6=5, which is valid.



---------------

So, for m=6, there are three k's:3,4,6. So three b=7-eautiful numbers.

But

---------------

 wait, let's verify:

For k=3: n=9. In base7, 9 is 12 (

---------------

1*7 +2=9). The digits are 1 and 2, sum is3, which is sqrt(9). So

---------------

 yes.

For k=4: n=16. In base7, 16 is 22 (2*7 +2=16). Sum

---------------

 is4, which is sqrt(16). So yes.

For k=6: n=36. In base7, 36 is 51 (5*7 +1=36). Sum is5+1=6, sqrt(36)=6. So

---------------

 yes.

So that's three numbers.

So, for m=6, count is3.

Wait, but in the range

---------------

 k=3 to6, we had k=3,4,6. So three numbers.

Hmm.

So, perhaps

---------------

 for each m, the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to write m as a product of two coprime factors

---------------

 a and b, such that a divides k and b divides (k -1). Each such pair (a,b) gives

---------------

 a solution for k.

Since m can be written as a product of coprime pairs (a,b), the number of such pairs is 2^{number

---------------

 of prime factors of m}, but since (a,b) and (b,a) are different unless a=b, but since

---------------

 a and b are coprime, unless m=1.

Wait, no, actually, for each factorization into coprime a

---------------

 and b, a*b =m, we have two possibilities unless a=b. But since a and b are coprime, a

---------------

 and b can only be equal if a=b=1. So, the number of such pairs is 2^{number of distinct prime factors of

---------------

 m}.

Wait, for example, m=6, which has prime factors 2 and3. So, number of coprime pairs (a,b) is

---------------

 2^2=4. But for m=6, the factorizations into coprime pairs are (1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1). But

---------------

 in reality, each unordered pair is unique, so for m=6, the number of unordered coprime pairs is 

---------------

2.

Wait, perhaps the number of coprime ordered pairs is 2^{number of prime factors}.

But perhaps

---------------

 I should think differently.

Wait, in any case, for each m, the number of solutions k is equal to the number of cop

---------------

rime pairs (a,b) such that a*b=m.

But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe another approach is better.

Let

---------------

 me try to compute for small m and see the pattern.

Compute for m from 1 to, say, 20, and

---------------

 see how the counts go.

Starting with m=1:

m=1:

Compute lower bound k: sqrt(2)≈1.414, ceil=

---------------

2. But k must be ≤1. So no solutions. Count=0.

m=2:

sqrt(3)=1.732, ceil=2. So k ranges

---------------

 from 2 to2.

Check if 2 divides k(k -1). For k=2: 2*1=2, which

---------------

 is divisible by2. So yes. d1=(4 -2)/2=2/2=1. Valid.



---------------

So count=1.

m=3:

sqrt(4)=2. So k=2,3.

Check k=2: 

---------------

2*1=2. Does 3 divide 2? No.

k=3:3*2=6. 3 divides6?

---------------

 Yes. d1=(9 -3)/3=6/3=2. Valid.

So count=1.

m=4:

sqrt(5)=~

---------------

2.236, ceil=3. So k=3,4.

k=3:3*2=6. 4 divides6? No.

k=4:4*3=12. 4 divides12? Yes. d1=(16 -4)/4=12/4=3. Valid.

Count=1.

Wait, but

---------------

 wait: is k=3 valid?

n=9. In base5, 9 is 14 (1*5 +4=9). Sum

---------------

 1+4=5, which is not equal to sqrt(9)=3. So no, that's not valid

---------------

. Hmm, so maybe my earlier logic is missing something.

Wait, no, in m=4, b=5.



---------------

Wait, for m=4, k=3: n=9.

In base5, 9 is 1*5 +4=9. Sum

---------------

 is 1+4=5, which is not equal to sqrt(9)=3. So this is invalid.

Wait

---------------

, so why did I think it was valid? Because d1= (9 -3)/4=6/4=1.5, which is not integer. Wait

---------------

, but earlier I thought it was.

Wait, no, wait, for m=4, k=3:

d1=(9

---------------

 -3)/4=6/4=1.5, which is not integer. So it's invalid. So why

---------------

 did I think it was?

Ah, because I thought 4 divides 6, but 6/4 is not integer. So,

---------------

 my mistake earlier.

So, for m=4, k=3: 4 divides6? 6 mod4=2,

---------------

 so no. So invalid.

k=4: 4*3=12, 12 mod4=0. So yes.



---------------

d1=(16-4)/4=12/4=3, which is ≤4. So valid.

So only

---------------

 k=4 is valid. So count=1.

Wait, so m=4, count=1.

Similarly, m

---------------

=5:

sqrt(6)=~2.449, ceil=3. So k=3,4,5.

Check each

So, count=3 (k=9,10,18).

m=18, count=3.

Hmm, so

---------------

 up to m=18, the maximum count is 3. So, for each m, the count is mostly 1 or 3,

---------------

 but not higher yet.

Wait, maybe when m is highly composite, the number of divisors increases, leading to more k's.



---------------

So, let's try m=24.

m=24:

sqrt(25)=5, so k ranges

---------------

 from5 to24.

Check each k:

But this is time-consuming. Maybe I can find a smarter way.

Wait

---------------

, perhaps for m=24, the number of k's is higher.

Alternatively, maybe m=24 is a

---------------

 candidate. Let me try.

m=24:

Compute lower bound: sqrt(25)=5. So k=

---------------

5 to24.

Now, check which k satisfy 24 dividesk(k-1).

So, k(k-1) must be divisible by24.

Since

---------------

 24=8*3, and k and k-1 are consecutive, one of them is even, and one

---------------

 of them must be divisible by3.

But to have k(k-1) divisible by8, either k or k-1 must be divisible by8, or one divisible

---------------

 by4 and the other divisible by2.

So, let's list the k's from5 to24 where k(k -1) is divisible by24.

Let

---------------

 me list the k's:

k=5:5*4=20. 24 divides20? No.

k=6:6*5=30. 24 divides30? No.

k=7:7*6=42. 24 divides42? No.

k=8:8*7=56. 24 divides56? No.

k=9:9*8=72. 24 divides72? Yes. So

---------------

, d1=(81 -9)/24=72/24=3. Valid.

k=10:10*9=90. 24 divides90? No.

k=11:11*10=110. 24 divides110? No.

k=12:12*11=132. 24 divides132? 

---------------

132/24=5.5. No.

k=13:13*12=156. 24 divides156? 156/24=6.5. No.

k=14:14*13=182. 24 divides182? No.

k=15:15*14=210. 24 divides210? 210/24=8.75. No.

k=16:16*15=240. 24 divides240? Yes. d1=(256 -16)/24=240/24=10. Valid.

k=17:17*16=272. 24 divides272? 272/24≈11.333. No.

k=18:18*17=306. 24 divides306? 306/24=12.75. No.

k=19:19*18=342. 24 divides342? 342/24=14.25. No.

k=20:20*19=380. 24 divides380? 380/24≈15.833. No.

k=21:21*20=420. 24 divides420? 420/24=17.5. No.

k=22:22*21=462. 24 divides462? 462/24=19.25. No.

k=23:23*22=506. 24 divides506? 506/24≈21.083. No.

k=24:24*23=552. 24 divides552? Yes. d1=(576 -24)/24=552/24=23. Valid.

So, for

---------------

 m=24, the valid k's are9,16,24. So count=3.

Hmm, same

---------------

 as before.

Wait, maybe m=30.

m=30:

sqrt(31)=5.567, ceil=6. So k=6 to30.

Check

---------------

 each k where 30 dividesk(k-1).

Since 30=2*3*5.

k(k -1) must be divisible by3

---------------

0.

Which requires that among k and k-1, one is divisible by2, one by3, and one by5.

But

---------------

 since k and k-1 are consecutive, one is even (divisible by2), one of them must be divisible by3, and one of

---------------

 them must be divisible by5.

So, let's find k such that either k or k-1 is divisible by5, and either

---------------

 k or k-1 is divisible by3.

So, for k from6 to30:

k=6:6*5=30. 30 divides30? Yes. d1=(36 -6)/30=30/30=1. Valid.

k=7:7*6=42. 30 divides42? No.

k=8:8*7=56. 30 divides56? No.

k=9:9*8=72. 30 divides72? No.

k=10:10*9=90. 30 divides90? Yes. d1=(100 -10)/30=90/30=3. Valid.

k=11:11*10=110. 30 divides110? No.

k=12:12*11=132. 30 divides132? No.

k=13:13*12=156. 30 divides156? No.

k=14:14*13=182. 30 divides182? No.

k=15:15*14=210. 30 divides210? Yes. d1=(225 -15)/30=210/30=7. Valid.

k=16:16*15=240. 30 divides240? Yes. d1=(256 -16)/30=240/30=8. Valid.

k=17:17*16=272. 30 divides272? No.

k=18:18*17=306. 30 divides306? 

---------------

306/30=10.2. No.

k=19:19*18=342. 30 divides342? 342/30=11.4. No.

k=20:20*19=380. 30 divides380? 380/30≈12.666. No.

k=21:21*20=420. 30 divides420? Yes. d1=(441 -21)/30=420/30=14. Valid.

k=22:22*21=462. 30 divides462? 462/30=15.4. No.

k=23:23*22=506. 30 divides506? 506/30≈16.866. No.

k=24:24*23=552. 30 divides552? 552/30=18.4. No.

k=25:25*24=600. 30 divides600? Yes. d1=(625 -25)/30=600/30=20. Valid.

k=26:26*25=650. 30 divides650? 650/30≈21.666. No.

k=27:27*26=702. 30 divides702? 702/30=23.4. No.

k=28:28*27=756. 30 divides756? 756/30=25.2. No.

k=29:29*28=812. 30 divides812? 812/30≈27.066. No.

k=30:30*29=870. 30 divides870? Yes. d1=(900 -30)/30=870/30=29. Valid.

So, for

---------------

 m=30, the valid k's are6,10,15,16,21,25,30. That

---------------

's 7 numbers. So count=7.

That's more than previous counts. So, m=30, count

---------------

=7.

Wait, 7 is more than 3 but still less than 10. So, need to go

---------------

 higher.

m=60:

sqrt(61)=7.81, ceil=8. So k=8 to60.

But

---------------

 m=60 is quite large. Let's see.

Wait, but perhaps m=60, which is 60,

---------------

 but it's time-consuming to compute manually. Maybe I can find a pattern.

Wait, perhaps the number of solutions for m is equal to the number of divisors of m,

---------------

 but only considering certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps m must be such that m has many small factors, allowing for more k's to

---------------

 satisfy m dividesk(k-1).

Wait, maybe m=60 has more solutions.

But let's think: m

---------------

=60.

Compute lower bound k: sqrt(61)=7.81, ceil=8. So k=8 to60.

For

---------------

 k in this range, check if 60 dividesk(k-1).

So, 60=4*3*5.

So

---------------

, for k(k-1) to be divisible by60, it must be divisible by4,3,5.

Since

---------------

 k and k-1 are consecutive, one is even, and one is odd.

To be divisible by4, either k or k-1 must be divisible by4.

To

---------------

 be divisible by3, either k or k-1 must be divisible by3.

To be divisible by5, either k or k-1 must be divisible by5.

So, for

---------------

 k from8 to60, let's find the k's where:

Either k or k-1 is divisible by4,

Either

---------------

 k or k-1 is divisible by3,

Either k or k-1 is divisible by5.

So, the valid

---------------

 k's are those where k ≡0 or1 mod4, k≡0 or1 mod3, and k≡0 or1 mod5.

So

---------------

, using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the solutions are the numbers where k ≡ a mod lcm(4,3,5)=60,

---------------

 for a=0 or1 in each modulus.

But since we are dealing with k up to60, let's list

---------------

 them:

Possible combinations:

For mod4: 0 or1

mod3: 0 or1

mod5:0 or1

So

---------------

, each combination is 2*2*2=8 possibilities.

But since we are looking for k in [8,60], we

---------------

 can compute the solutions for each combination.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe an alternative approach.

Alternatively, for m=60, the

---------------

 number of k's is equal to the number of integers in [8,60] such that k ≡0 or1 mod4, k≡0 or1 mod3, and k≡0 or1 mod5.

But

---------------

 perhaps it's easier to note that the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of m, but only for

---------------

 specific cases.

Wait, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to choose for each prime factor whether it divides k or k-1.



---------------

Since m is 60=2^2*3*5.

For each prime power, we can assign it to divide

---------------

 either k or k-1.

But since 2^2 is a prime power, and 3 and5 are primes

---------------

.

So, for 2^2: it can divide k or k-1.

Similarly, 3 can divide k or k-1.

Similarly,5 can divide k or k-1.

So

---------------

, the total number of possibilities is 2^3=8.

Each possibility corresponds to a unique solution modulo m=60.

But

---------------

 since k must be in [8,60], each solution modulo60 will correspond to one k in that range.



---------------

So, for m=60, the number of solutions is8.

But wait, let me check.

But not all

---------------

 combinations may result in a k in [8,60]. For example, the solution k=1 mod4, 

---------------

1 mod3, 1 mod5 is k=1, which is below8.

Similarly, other solutions may be above

---------------

60, but since we're looking up to60, perhaps each of the 8 solutions falls within [8,60].



---------------

But let's compute.

The solutions are the numbers k such that:

k ≡ a mod4,

k ≡ b mod3,

k ≡ c mod5,

where a ∈

---------------

{0,1}, b ∈{0,1}, c ∈{0,1}.

So, 8 possibilities

---------------

.

We can compute each:

1. a=0, b=0, c=0: k ≡0 mod4, 0 mod3, 0 mod5.

---------------

 So, k ≡0 mod60. So, k=60. Which is within [8,60]. Valid

---------------

.

2. a=0, b=0, c=1: k≡0 mod4, 0 mod3, 1 mod5.

S

---------------

olve:

Find k ≡0 mod12 (since lcm(4,3)=12),

and k≡1 mod5.

Find

---------------

 k ≡0 mod12 and k≡1 mod5.

Let k=12m.

12m ≡1 mod5 ⇒12m �

---------------

�1 ⇒2m≡1 mod5 ⇒m≡3 mod5.

So, m=5n +3.

Thus, k=12*(5n +3)=60n +36.

Within

---------------

 [8,60], n=0: k=36.

n=1:60+36=96>60. So, only k=36.

3

---------------

. a=0, b=1, c=0: k≡0 mod4, 1 mod3, 0 mod5.

Find

---------------

 k ≡0 mod4, 1 mod3, 0 mod5.

So, k must be divisible by5

---------------

 and4, so divisible by20.

So, k=20m.

20m ≡1 mod3 ⇒20m �

---------------

�1 ⇒2m≡1 mod3 ⇒m≡2 mod3.

So, m=3n +2.

Thus, k=20*(3n +2)=60n +40.

Within [8,60], n=0:40.



---------------

n=1:100>60. So, k=40.

4. a=0, b=1, c=1: k≡0 mod4, 1 mod3, 1 mod5.

Find

---------------

 k≡0 mod4,

k≡1 mod3,

k≡1 mod5.

So, solve:

k ≡1 mod3 and k

---------------

≡1 mod5 ⇒k≡1 mod15.

So, k=15m +1.

Also, k≡

---------------

0 mod4.

So, 15m +1 ≡0 mod4 ⇒15m ≡-1 mod4 ⇒15m

---------------

 ≡3 mod4 ⇒15≡3 mod4 ⇒3m≡3 mod4 ⇒m≡1 mod4.

So, m=4n +1.

Thus, k=15*(4n +1)+1=60n +16.

Within [8,60], n=0:16.

n=1:76>60. So, k=16.

5. a=1, b=0, c=0: k≡1 mod4, 0 mod3, 0 mod5.

Find

---------------

 k≡1 mod4,

k≡0 mod3,

k≡0 mod5.

So, k must be divisible by15.



---------------

Let k=15m.

15m ≡1 mod4 ⇒15m ≡1 ⇒3m≡1 mod4 ⇒m≡3 mod4.

So, m=4n +3.

Thus, k=15*(4n +3)=60n +45.

Within [8,60], n=0:45.

n=1:105>60. So, k=45.

6. a=1, b=0, c=1: k≡1 mod4, 0 mod3, 1 mod5.

Find k≡1 mod4,

k≡0 mod3,

k≡1 mod5.

So

---------------

, solve:

k≡0 mod3,

k≡1 mod4,

k≡1 mod5.

First, find k ≡1 mod4 and k≡1 mod5.



---------------

Which is k≡1 mod20.

So, k=20m +1.

Now, 20m +1 ≡0 mod3 ⇒20m +1 ≡2m +1 ≡0 mod3 ⇒2m ≡-1 mod

---------------

3 ⇒2m ≡2 mod3 ⇒m≡1 mod3.

So, m=3n +1.

Thus, k=20*(3n +1) +1=60n +21.

Within [8,60], n=0:21.

n=1:81>60. So, k=21.

7. a=1, b=1, c=0: k≡1 mod4, 1 mod3, 0 mod5.

Find k≡1 mod4,

k≡1 mod3,

k≡0 mod5.

So

---------------

, k must be divisible by5.

Let k=5m.

Also, k≡1 mod4 and k≡1 mod3.

So, 5m ≡1 mod4 ⇒5m≡1 ⇒m≡1 mod4.



---------------

And 5m ≡1 mod3 ⇒5m≡1 ⇒2m≡1 mod3 ⇒m≡2 mod3.

So, m �

---------------

�1 mod4 and m≡2 mod3.

Find m using Chinese Remainder:

Find m ≡x mod12.

m

---------------

 ≡1 mod4,

m ≡2 mod3.

Possible m: Let's list m mod12.

m

---------------

=2: 2≡2 mod3, 2≡2 mod4≠1.

m=5:5≡2 mod3, 5≡1 mod4.

---------------

 Yes.

So, m≡5 mod12.

Thus, m=12n +5.

Thus, k=5*(12n +5)=60n +25.

Within [8,60], n=0:25.

n=1:85>60. So, k=25.

8. a=1, b=1, c=1: k≡1 mod4,1 mod3,1 mod5.

Find

---------------

 k≡1 mod4,

k≡1 mod3,

k≡1 mod5.

Thus, k ≡1 mod lcm(4,3,5)=60.

So, k=60n +1.

Within [8,60], n=0:1 (

---------------

too low).

n=1:61>60. So, no solution in [8,60].

So

---------------

, the solutions are:

k=60,36,40,16,45,21,25.

That

---------------

's7 solutions.

But wait, earlier when I thought m=60, I thought there would be8 solutions, but one

---------------

 falls below8, so only7.

But let's verify:

k=16: n=256. In base61, 

---------------

256 is represented as d1*d2.

Wait, base61: 256 divided by61 is4,

---------------

 remainder12. So, digits are4 and12. But 12 is a valid digit in base61.

---------------

 Sum is4+12=16. sqrt(256)=16. So valid.

Similarly, k=21: n=441.

In

---------------

 base61:441 /61=7, remainder14. So digits7 and14. Sum7

---------------

+14=21. sqrt(441)=21. Valid.

k=25: n=625.

625 /61=10, remainder15. So

---------------

 digits10 and15. Sum25. Valid.

k=36: n=1296.

1296 /61=21, remainder15. So

---------------

 digits21 and15. Sum36. Valid.

k=40: n=1600.

1600 /61=26, remainder1

---------------

4. Digits26 and14. Sum40. Valid.

k=45: n=2025.

2025 /61=33, remainder1

---------------

2. Digits33 and12. Sum45. Valid.

k=60: n=3600.

3600 /61=59, remainder1. Digits59 and1. Sum60. sqrt

---------------

(3600)=60. Valid.

So, that's7 solutions. So count=7.

Wait, but

---------------

 earlier I thought the number of solutions would be8, but one falls below8, so only7.

So, for m=60, count=7.

Hmm

---------------

, still less than10.

Wait, perhaps m=120.

But this is getting too big. Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 m=240.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to find m where the number of solutions is higher.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 m=120.

m=120:

sqrt(121)=11, so k=11 to120.

Number

---------------

 of solutions is equal to the number of k in [11,120] such that 120 dividesk(k -1).

1

---------------

20=8*3*5.

So, similar to m=60, but with an additional factor of2.



---------------

Wait, 120=8*3*5.

So, k(k -1) must be divisible by8,3,5.

Thus

---------------

, similar to before, but with higher powers.

So, for k in11 to120, find k where:



---------------

Either k or k-1 is divisible by8,

Either k or k-1 is divisible by3,

Either k or k-1 is divisible by5.

So

---------------

, the number of solutions is again 2^3=8 possibilities, but within the range.

But since m=120, the

---------------

 solutions would be:

Each combination of assignments of the prime powers to k or k-1.

Thus, for each of the 8 possibilities

---------------

, there would be one solution modulo120.

So, let's compute the solutions.

Each solution is k ≡ a

---------------

 mod8, k≡b mod3, k≡c mod5, where a ∈{0,1}, b∈{0,1}, c∈{0,1}.

But

---------------

 since m=120, the solutions will be in the range [1,120]. So, for each combination, there

---------------

 will be exactly one solution in that range.

So, 8 solutions.

But let's check if any fall below11.

The

---------------

 smallest solution is k=1, which is below11. The next is k=1 +120=121, which is above120.

Wait

---------------

, no, each combination will have exactly one solution in [1,120]. So, the solutions are:

1

---------------

. a=0,b=0,c=0: k=0 mod8,0 mod3,0 mod5 ⇒

---------------

k=0 mod120 ⇒k=120.

2. a=0,b=0,c=1: k=0 mod8,0 mod3,1 mod5.



---------------

Find k ≡0 mod24 (lcm(8,3)=24),

k≡1 mod5.

So

---------------

, 24m ≡1 mod5 ⇒24m≡4m≡1 mod5 ⇒4m≡1 ⇒m≡4^{-1}=4 mod5.



---------------

So, m=5n +4.

Thus, k=24*(5n +4)=120n +96.

Within [11,120], n=0:96.

3. a=0,b=1,c=0: k=0 mod8,1 mod3,0 mod5.

Find

---------------

 k ≡0 mod8,

k≡1 mod3,

k≡0 mod5.

k must be divisible by5

---------------

 and8, so divisible by40.

k=40m.

40m ≡1 mod3 ⇒40m≡1 ⇒m

---------------

≡1 mod3.

So, m=3n +1.

Thus, k=40*(3n +1)=120n +40.

Within [11,120], n=0:40.

n=1:160>120.

4. a=0,b=1,c=1: k=0 mod8,1 mod3,1 mod5.

Find k≡0 mod8,

k≡1 mod3,

k≡1 mod5.

So

---------------

, solve:

k≡1 mod3 and1 mod5 ⇒k≡1 mod15.

So, k=15m +1.

Also, k≡0 mod8 ⇒15m +1 ≡0 mod8 ⇒15m ≡-1 mod8 ⇒15m≡7 mod8 ⇒15≡7 mod8 ⇒7m≡7 mod8 ⇒m≡1 mod8.

Thus, m=8n +1.

So

---------------

, k=15*(8n +1)+1=120n +16.

Within [11,120], n=0:16.

n=1:136>120.

5. a=1,b=0,c=0: k=1 mod8,0 mod3,0 mod5.

Find k≡1 mod8,

k≡0 mod3,

k≡0 mod5.

k

---------------

 must be divisible by15.

k=15m.

15m ≡1 mod8 ⇒15m≡1 ⇒7

---------------

m≡1 mod8 ⇒m≡7 mod8.

So, m=8n +7.

Thus, k=15*(8n +7)=120n +105.

Within [11,120], n=0:105.

n=1:225>120.

6. a=1,b=0,c=1: k=1 mod8,0 mod3,1 mod5.

Find k≡1 mod8,

k≡0 mod3,

k≡1 mod5.

S

---------------

olve:

k≡0 mod3,

k≡1 mod5,

k≡1 mod8.

First, solve k≡1 mod5 and k

---------------

≡1 mod8.

Which is k≡1 mod40.

So, k=40m +1.

Now

---------------

, 40m +1 ≡0 mod3 ⇒40m +1 ≡1m +1 ≡0 mod3 ⇒m≡

---------------

-1≡2 mod3.

So, m=3n +2.

Thus, k=40*(3n +2)+1=120n +81.

Within [11,120], n=0:81.

n=1:201>120.

7. a=1,b=1,c=0: k=1 mod8,1 mod3,0 mod5.

Find k≡1 mod8,

k≡1 mod3,

k≡0 mod5.

So

---------------

, k must be divisible by5.

k=5m.

Also, k≡1 mod8 and1 mod3.

So

---------------

, 5m ≡1 mod8 ⇒5m≡1 ⇒m≡5^{-1}=5 mod8.

And

---------------

 5m ≡1 mod3 ⇒5m≡1 ⇒2m≡1 ⇒m≡2 mod3.

So

---------------

, m≡5 mod8 and m≡2 mod3.

Find m:

m ≡5 mod8,

m ≡2 mod3.

Let

---------------

 m=8n +5.

8n +5 ≡2 mod3 ⇒8n ≡-3 ≡0 mod3 ⇒8

---------------

n ≡0 ⇒2n ≡0 ⇒n≡0 mod3.

Thus, n=3k.

So, m=8*(3k) +5=24k +5.

Thus, k=5*(24k +5)=120k +25.

Within [11,120], k=0:25.

k=1:145>120.

8. a=1,b=1,c=1: k=1 mod8,1 mod3,1 mod5.

Find

---------------

 k≡1 mod8,

k≡1 mod3,

k≡1 mod5.

So, k≡1 mod lcm(8,3,5)=120.

Thus, k=120n +1.

Within [11,120], n=0:1 (too low).



---------------

n=1:121>120. So, no solution.

Thus, the solutions are:

k=120,96,40,16,105,81,25.

That

---------------

's7 solutions. Wait, same as m=60.

Hmm, but wait, m=120, count

---------------

=7. So, same as m=60.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Because m=120 is

---------------

 double m=60, but the number of solutions didn't double.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is not directly

---------------

 dependent on m but on the number of prime factors.

Wait, perhaps the number of solutions is 2^{number of distinct prime factors}

---------------

.

But m=60 has 3 distinct prime factors, so 2^3=8, but we have7 solutions because

---------------

 one is below the lower bound.

Similarly, m=120 has the same number of distinct prime factors, so same

---------------

 number of solutions.

Wait, perhaps for m=240, which has more prime factors?

Wait, m=240=16*3*5.

---------------

 So, same number of distinct prime factors (2,3,5), but higher exponents.

So, perhaps the number of solutions would

---------------

 still be8, but one is below the lower bound, so7.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps m=30 has

---------------

3 prime factors, and m=30 has7 solutions? Wait, no, earlier for m=30, count

---------------

 was7.

Wait, maybe the number of solutions isn't directly tied to the number of prime factors, but to the number

---------------

 of ways to assign the prime factors to k or k-1.

But for m=30, it's 7

---------------

 solutions, which is less than 2^3=8.

Wait, perhaps for m=30, one solution is

---------------

 below the lower bound, so we have7.

Similarly, for m=60 and m=120, one

---------------

 solution is below the lower bound, so7.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the least b where there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers.

---------------

 So, I need to find m where the count exceeds10.

So, perhaps I need to find m where the number of solutions is

---------------

 more than10.

Wait, maybe m=840, which is the least common multiple of1-8,

---------------

 but that's too big.

Alternatively, perhaps m=240.

Wait, but earlier, m=240 had

---------------

7 solutions.

Wait, perhaps I need to find m with more prime factors, allowing more combinations.

Wait, m=2

---------------

10=2*3*5*7. So, four distinct prime factors.

Thus, the number of solutions would be2^4=16,

---------------

 but one may be below the lower bound.

So, for m=210:

Compute the lower bound for k: sqrt(211)=14.525

---------------

, ceil=15.

So, k ranges from15 to210.

Number of solutions is16 (

---------------

all combinations of 4 prime factors assigned to k or k-1), but one may be below15.

Let me compute

---------------

:

Each combination of a=0 or1 mod2, b=0 or1 mod3, c=0 or1 mod5, d=0 or1 mod7.

But

---------------

 this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is16, but some are below15.

But

---------------

 it's time-consuming to compute manually.

Alternatively, perhaps for m=210, the count is15, which

---------------

 is more than10.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for m where m is a factorial

---------------

, as they have many factors.

Wait, m=720=6!.

But this is getting too big, and perhaps

---------------

 not necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps m=1260=2^2*3^2*5*7.

But

---------------

 again, this is too time-consuming.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of div

---------------

isors of m, but only considering the coprime pairs.

Wait, perhaps for m=240, which has3

---------------

2 divisors, but many of them are not coprime.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the

---------------

 number of solutions increases when m is a multiple of many small primes, allowing more combinations.

So, perhaps m=21

---------------

0=2*3*5*7.

So, for m=210, the number of solutions would be2^4=16.



---------------

But since the lower bound is sqrt(211)=14.5, so k starts at15.

So

---------------

, 16 solutions, but one is k=1, which is below15, so15 solutions.

Thus

---------------

, for m=210, count=15.

Which is more than10.

So, then b=m +1=211.

But wait

---------------

, is this the minimal m?

Wait, let's check for smaller m.

Wait, m=120 had7 solutions.



---------------

What about m=180=2^2*3^2*5.

Number of solutions would be2^3=8,

---------------

 but one is below the lower bound.

So, count=7.

Similarly, m=240, count=7.

Wait

---------------

, perhaps m=360.

m=360=2^3*3^2*5.

Number of solutions=

---------------

2^3=8, count=7.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe m=420=2^2*3*5*7.

Number

---------------

 of solutions=2^4=16, count=15.

So, b=421.

But perhaps

---------------

 m=210 is the first with15 solutions.

But is there a smaller m with more than10 solutions?

Wait, let

---------------

's think of m=60, which had7 solutions.

What about m=120, same as60.



---------------

Wait, perhaps m=840=2^3*3*5*7.

Number of solutions=2^4=16, count=15.

So

---------------

, perhaps the minimal m is210.

But I need to confirm.

Alternatively, perhaps m=60 has7

---------------

, m=120 has7, m=180 has7, m=240 has7, m=360 has7, m=420 has15.

Thus

---------------

, the minimal m where count>10 is m=210, giving b=211.

But wait

---------------

, m=210 is 2*3*5*7, which is the product of first four primes.

So

---------------

, the number of solutions is2^4=16, but one is below the lower bound, so15.

Thus

---------------

, for m=210, count=15>10.

So, the minimal b is211.

But wait

---------------

, is there a smaller m with count>10?

Wait, m=1260 is larger, but perhaps

---------------

 m=300.

Wait, m=300=2^2*3*5^2.

Number of solutions=

---------------

2^3=8, count=7.

No.

Wait, m=420=2^2*3*5*7.

Number

---------------

 of solutions=2^4=16, count=15.

So, yes, m=420 is

---------------

 smaller than m=1260.

Wait, but is there a smaller m than420 with count>10?

Wait

---------------

, m=210 is smaller than420, but m=210 is 210,

---------------

 which is smaller than420.

Wait, but m=210 is 210, which is smaller

---------------

 than420.

So, m=210, count=15.

Thus, b=211.

Wait

---------------

, but wait, I'm not sure if m=210 is the minimal m with count>10.

Wait

---------------

, perhaps m=840=2^3*3*5*7.

Which is larger than210, but the

---------------

 count would be16.

But I'm looking for the minimal b, so m=210 is better.

Wait

---------------

, but I'm not sure if m=210 is indeed the minimal.

Alternatively, perhaps m=240.



---------------

Wait, m=240=2^4*3*5.

Number of solutions=2^3=8, count=7.

No

---------------

.

Alternatively, m=1260=2^2*3^2*5*7.

Number of solutions=2^4=16, count=15.

So

---------------

, same as m=210 and m=420.

But m=210 is smaller.

Thus

---------------

, the minimal b would be211.

Wait, but wait, let's think again.

Earlier, for m=30, count

---------------

=7.

For m=60, count=7.

For m=120, count=7.

For m=180, count=7.

For m=240, count=7.

For m=360, count=7.

For m=420, count=15.

For

---------------

 m=210, count=15.

So, m=210 is the first m where count=

---------------

15>10.

Thus, b=211.

Wait, but is there a smaller m with count>10?

Wait

---------------

, perhaps m=840=2^3*3*5*7.

But m=840 is larger than210.

So

---------------

, m=210 is the minimal m with count>10.

Thus, the least integer b is211.

Wait

---------------

, but earlier I thought m=210, count=15.

But wait, for m=210, the

---------------

 lower bound is sqrt(211)=14.525, so k starts at15.

Thus, in

---------------

 the range15 to210, all solutions except k=1 are valid.

So, number of solutions=16-1=15.

Thus

---------------

, count=15>10.

So, the minimal b is211.

But wait, earlier for m=3

---------------

0, count=7.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, for m=30, the count was7,

---------------

 but for m=210, it's15.

So, the minimal m where count>10 is m=210, b

---------------

=211.

Thus, the answer is211.


The least integer \( b \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful integers is \(

---------------

 \boxed{211} \).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
