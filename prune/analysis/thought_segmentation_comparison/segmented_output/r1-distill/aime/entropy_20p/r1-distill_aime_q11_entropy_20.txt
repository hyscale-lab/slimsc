Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. Let me read it again carefully to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The

---------------

 problem is about a 2x3 grid. Each cell in the grid needs to have a digit placed in it. The

---------------

 conditions are that when you read the grid left to right, the two numbers formed should add up to 999. Additionally

---------------

, when you read the grid top to bottom, the three numbers formed should add up to 99. They gave an example grid

---------------

 that satisfies these conditions, and I need to find how many such arrangements are possible.

Alright, let me break this down. The

---------------

 grid is 2 rows by 3 columns. So, when reading left to right, each row forms a three-digit number. Let

---------------

's denote the grid as follows:

```
a b c
d e f
```

So, the first number (

---------------

top row) is 100a + 10b + c. The second number (bottom row) is 100d + 10e + f. Their

---------------

 sum should be 999. So,

(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999.

Also

---------------

, when reading top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. So, the first column is 10a + d, the second column is 10b + e, and the third column is 10c + f. Their sum should be 99.

---------------

 So,

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

So

---------------

, I have two equations:

1. (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999


---------------

2. (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

I

---------------

 think it would help to write these equations in a more manageable form. Let me expand the first equation:

100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.



---------------

I can group similar terms:

100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

Similarly, for

---------------

 the second equation:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Group

---------------

ing terms:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Hmm

---------------

. So now I have two equations:

1. 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.


---------------

2. 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

I

---------------

 need to find the number of possible digit assignments (a, b, c, d, e, f) that satisfy both equations.

---------------

 Each of a, b, c, d, e, f is a digit, meaning they can be from 0 to 9,

---------------

 except perhaps a and d, which are the first digits of three-digit and two-digit numbers, respectively. Wait, but in

---------------

 the example, a is 0 and d is 9. So, leading zeros are allowed? Because in the example, the top row is 008, which is 

---------------

8, and the bottom is 991, which is fine. So, leading zeros are allowed for both the rows

---------------

 and columns. So, a and d can be zero. So, all digits from 0 to 9 are allowed for

---------------

 all cells.

So, that's good to know. So, no restrictions on a and d being non-zero.

Now, let

---------------

 me try to manipulate these equations to find relationships between the variables.

Let me denote some variables to simplify:

Let S1 = a + d


---------------

S2 = b + e
S3 = c + f

From equation 1:

100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.



---------------

So, equation 1 is:

100 S1 + 10 S2 + S3 = 999.

---------------

  (Equation A)

Similarly, from equation 2, let's denote:

T1 = a + b + c
T2 = d + e + f

So

---------------

 equation 2 is:

10 T1 + T2 = 99.  (Equation B)

So now,

---------------

 we have Equation A and Equation B.

But I need to find the number of possible assignments of a, b, c, d, e, f such

---------------

 that both equations are satisfied.

Let me see if I can express some variables in terms of others.

Looking at Equation B:

---------------

 10 T1 + T2 = 99.

Let me solve for T2: T2 = 99 - 10 T1.

Since

---------------

 T1 and T2 are sums of digits, each T1 and T2 must be non-negative integers. Let's see

---------------

 the possible values T1 can take.

Since T1 = a + b + c, and each of a, b, c is between

---------------

 0 and 9, the minimum T1 is 0 and maximum is 27 (if all are 9). But since

---------------

 10 T1 + T2 = 99, T1 must satisfy 10 T1 ≤ 99,

---------------

 so T1 ≤ 9.9, so T1 can be from 0 to 9.

But T1 is

---------------

 an integer, so T1 can be 0,1,2,...,9.

Similarly, T2 = 99 - 10 T1.

---------------

 Since T2 is the sum of three digits (d + e + f), each of which is between 0 and 9, the

---------------

 minimum T2 is 0 and maximum is 27.

So, 99 - 10 T1 must be between 0 and 27.



---------------

So, 99 - 10 T1 ≥ 0 → T1 ≤ 9.9 → T1 ≤9.



---------------

And 99 - 10 T1 ≤ 27 → 99 -27 ≤ 10 T1 → 72 ≤ 10 T1 → T1 ≥7.2.



---------------

Since T1 is an integer, T1 ≥8.

So T1 can be 8 or 9.

So,

---------------

 T1 can be 8 or 9.

Let me consider each case.

Case 1: T1 =8



---------------

Then T2 =99 -10*8=99-80=19.

Case 2: T1=9

Then T2=99 -90=9.

So,

---------------

 we have two cases: T1=8, T2=19; or T1=9, T2=9.

Now

---------------

, let's go back to Equation A: 100 S1 +10 S2 + S3 =999.

But

---------------

 S1 =a +d, S2 =b +e, S3= c +f.

So, S1, S2, S3 are sums

---------------

 of two digits each. So each S can range from 0 to 18.

So, 100 S1 +10 S2 + S3 =

---------------

999.

Let me think about this. The left side is a three-digit number where S1 is the hundreds digit, S2 the tens, and S3 the units.

---------------

 So, 100 S1 +10 S2 + S3 = 999.

So, this

---------------

 implies that:

S1 must be 9, because 999 has 9 in the hundreds place.

So, S1=9.

Then

---------------

, the equation becomes:

100*9 +10 S2 + S3=999 → 900 +10 S2 + S3=999 → 10 S2 + S3=99.

So

---------------

, 10 S2 + S3=99.

Now, S2 and S3 are sums of two digits,

---------------

 so each can be from 0 to 18.

So, 10 S2 + S3=99.

Let

---------------

 me solve for possible S2 and S3.

Let me denote that equation as:

10 S2 + S3 =99.



---------------

We can write this as:

S3=99 -10 S2.

Since S3 must be between 0 and 18,

---------------

 let's see the possible values of S2.

99 -10 S2 ≥0 → 10 S2 ≤99 → S2 ≤9.9 →

---------------

 S2 ≤9.

Also, 99 -10 S2 ≤18 → 99-18 ≤10 S2 →81 ≤10 S2 → S2 ≥8.1 →

---------------

 S2 ≥9.

So, S2 must be exactly 9.

So, S2=9, then S3=99-90=9.

So, S

---------------

2=9, S3=9.

So, in Equation A, we have S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.

So

---------------

, summarizing, from Equation A, S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.

So, now

---------------

 we have:

From the grid:

S1 = a + d =9

S2 = b + e=9

S3 =c +f=9

So

---------------

, each pair of variables in a column sums to 9.

So, each pair (a,d), (b,e), (c,f) must

---------------

 add up to 9.

So, this is interesting. So, each column in the grid sums to 9.

Wait

---------------

, but wait. Because each column is read as a two-digit number. So, for example, the first column is 10a + d.

---------------

 But a + d =9, but 10a + d can be anything from 0 to 99,

---------------

 depending on a and d.

Wait, but we have that a + d=9, but 10a + d is

---------------

 a two-digit number. Wait, but a can be zero. So, for example, if a=0, d=9, then

---------------

 the column number is 09, which is 9. Similarly, if a=5, d=4, the

---------------

 column number is 54.

So, each column's two-digit number can vary based on a and d, but their

---------------

 sum is 9.

But from Equation B, which is 10 T1 + T2=99, and

---------------

 T1 is a +b +c, T2 is d +e +f.

But since S1=9, S

---------------

2=9, S3=9, T2 = d + e + f = (d + e + f)=

---------------

 (9 - a) + (9 - b) + (9 - c) = 27 - (a + b + c)

---------------

 =27 - T1.

So, T2=27 - T1.

But from Equation B, T2=99 -10 T1.

So,



---------------

27 - T1 =99 -10 T1 → 27 - T1 =99 -10 T1 →

---------------

 9 T1=72 → T1=8.

So, T1=8.

Thus, from earlier, T

---------------

1 can be 8 or 9, but in this case, it must be 8 because T2=27 - T1=

---------------

19, which fits into our earlier analysis.

Wait, so that means T1 must be 8, which makes T2=19.

So

---------------

, in this case, T1= a + b + c=8, and T2= d + e + f=19.

But since

---------------

 d=9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c, because a +d=9, etc., then

---------------

:

d + e + f= (9 -a) + (9 -b) + (9 -c)=27 - (a + b + c)=27 - T1=27 -8=19,

---------------

 which matches.

So, all right, so everything is consistent.

So, now, the problem reduces to finding the number of 

---------------

2x3 grids where each column sums to 9, and the sum of the top row digits (a + b + c) is 8, and

---------------

 the sum of the bottom row digits (d + e + f)=19.

But since d=9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c, and

---------------

 d + e + f=19, as we saw.

So, the key is to find the number of possible triples

---------------

 (a, b, c) such that a + b + c=8, and each of a, b, c is between 0 and 9 (

---------------

inclusive), and each pair (a, d), (b, e), (c, f) sums to 9,

---------------

 with d=9 -a, etc.

But since each a, b, c is a digit, and d, e, f are determined

---------------

 by a, b, c, the main variables are a, b, c.

So, the number of possible grids is equal to the number of non

---------------

-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8, where each of a, b, c is between 0 and 9,

---------------

 inclusive.

Wait, but since a, b, c are digits, each can be from 0 to 9, and

---------------

 a + b + c=8.

So, the number of solutions is the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8, with

---------------

 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤9.

Since 8 is less than 3*9=27, and

---------------

 each variable is at most 9, the constraints are automatically satisfied because a, b, c can be at most 8,

---------------

 which is less than 9.

Wait, no, because the maximum any of them can be is 8, since the

---------------

 sum is 8. So, each of a, b, c is ≤8, which is ≤9, so the

---------------

 upper bounds are automatically satisfied.

So, the number of solutions is the same as the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8,

---------------

 which is C(8 + 3 -1, 3 -1)=C(10,2)=45.

But

---------------

 wait, but digits can be zero, so yes, that's correct. So, 45 solutions.

But wait, each

---------------

 solution corresponds to a possible (a, b, c), and for each such solution, d=9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c.



---------------

But we need to make sure that d, e, f are digits, i.e., between 0 and 9.



---------------

Since a can be up to 8, d=9 -a is at least 1, and since a is at

---------------

 least 0, d is at most 9. So, d is a digit.

Similarly, e and f will be digits as

---------------

 well.

So, all the variables a, b, c, d, e, f are digits.

Therefore, each solution

---------------

 (a, b, c) with a + b + c=8 gives a valid grid.

So, the total number of grids

---------------

 is 45.

Wait, but wait a second.

In the example given, a=0, b=0, c=8.

---------------

 So, a + b + c=8, which fits.

But in that case, d=9-0=9, e=9-0=9, f=9-8=1.

---------------

 So, d + e + f=9+9+1=19, which matches T2=19.

So

---------------

, that example is one of the 45 possible grids.

But wait, is that all? Because I feel like that

---------------

's the case, but let me check.

Wait, but perhaps there are constraints I'm missing.

Wait, the top row is

---------------

 100a +10b +c, which is a three-digit number, but a can be zero, so

---------------

 it's effectively a three-digit number with leading zeros allowed. Similarly for the bottom row.

So, all grids are allowed as

---------------

 long as the digits sum correctly.

So, yes, the number of solutions is 45.

Wait, but wait,

---------------

 is that correct? Let me think again.

Wait, 45 is the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8.

---------------

 But each of a, b, c can be 0 to 8, inclusive, so yes, 45.



---------------

But let me think if any of the digits a, b, c can be more than 9? No, because 

---------------

8 is the maximum any can be, which is less than 9.

So, all 45 solutions are valid.

So

---------------

, the total number of such grids is 45.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think if there are

---------------

 other constraints.

Wait, when I look at the first equation, 100 S1 +10 S2 + S3=999,

---------------

 and we found S1=S2=S3=9.

So, each column sum is 9.

So, each column

---------------

 is a two-digit number where the digits sum to 9.

But in the example, the first column is 09

---------------

, which is 9, the second is 09, and the third is 81, which are all two

---------------

-digit numbers where digits sum to 9.

So, that's correct.

So, each column is a two-digit number (

---------------

possibly with leading zero) where the digits add to 9.

So, the number of such two-digit numbers is 10:

---------------

 09, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90.

Wait

---------------

, wait, 10 numbers because for each digit a from 0 to 9, d=9 -a.

---------------

 So, 10 possibilities.

So, for each column, there are 10 possibilities.

But in our case, the

---------------

 columns are determined by a, b, c and d, e, f.

But in our problem, the columns are (

---------------

a, d), (b, e), (c, f), each summing to 9.

So, for each column

---------------

, the digits sum to 9, so each column can be any of the 10 possibilities.

But in our problem

---------------

, the variables a, b, c are the top digits, and d, e, f are determined as 9 -a, 9 -b, 9 -c.

So

---------------

, for each column, the top digit is a variable, and the bottom is determined.

So, in this case, the

---------------

 number of grids is equal to the number of possible a, b, c such that a + b + c=8.



---------------

Which is 45.

So, that's the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again.



---------------

Wait, another approach: Each column can be any of the 10 possible two-digit numbers where the digits sum to 9.

---------------

 So, 10 possibilities per column.

So, for three columns, the total number of grids would be 10^3=1000.



---------------

But, we have the additional constraint that the sum of the top row digits is 8.

Because T1= a + b + c=8.

So

---------------

, the number of grids where each column sums to 9, and the top row digits sum to 8.

So, how

---------------

 does that affect the count?

Each column is (x, 9 -x), where x is from 0 to 9.



---------------

So, the top digits are a, b, c, which are x1, x2, x3 for the three columns.

So

---------------

, a =x1, b=x2, c=x3.

And we have x1 +x2 +x3=8.

So

---------------

, the number of possible (x1, x2, x3) where each xi is between 0 and 9, and their

---------------

 sum is 8.

Which is the same as the number of non-negative integer solutions to x1 +x2 +x3=8, which is C(8 +3 -1, 3-1)=C(10,2)=45.

So

---------------

, same as before.

So, that's correct.

Therefore, the total number of grids is 45.

But wait

---------------

, but in the example, a=0, b=0, c=8.

Which is one of the 45.



---------------

So, the answer is 45.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure.

Is there any other constraint I

---------------

'm missing?

Wait, the sum of the top row is 8, which is allowed, as digits can be zero.

But

---------------

 let me think if any of the digits in the top row could be greater than 9, but since the sum is 8, each

---------------

 digit is at most 8, which is fine.

So, no issues.

So, yes, the answer is 45.


To

---------------

 solve the problem, we analyze the given conditions. The grid is a 2x3 matrix where the sum of the two three-digit numbers formed by reading each

---------------

 row left to right is 999, and the sum of the three two-digit numbers formed by reading each column top to bottom is 99.

Let

---------------

 the grid be:

```
a b c
d e f
```

From the first condition, the sum of the two three

---------------

-digit numbers is:
\[
(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999
\]

From the second condition, the sum of the three two-digit numbers is:
\[
(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99
\]

Let \( S_1 = a + d \), \( S_2 = b + e \), \( S_3 = c + f \), and \( T_1 = a + b + c \), \( T_2 = d + e + f \). From

---------------

 the first equation:
\[
100S_1 + 10S_2 + S_3 = 999
\]
From

---------------

 the second equation:
\[
10T_1 + T_2 = 99
\]

From the first equation, \(

---------------

 S_1 = 9 \), \( S_2 = 9 \), and \( S_3 = 9 \)

---------------

 because \( 100 \times 9 + 10 \times 9 + 9 = 999 \). This means each column sums

---------------

 to 9, so \( a + d = 9 \), \( b + e = 9 \), and \( c + f = 9 \).

From the second equation, substituting \( T_2 = 27 - T_1 \) (since \( d + e + f = 27 - (a + b + c) \)):
\[
10T_1 + (27 - T_1) = 99 \implies 9T_1 = 72 \implies T_1 = 8
\]
Thus, \( a + b + c = 8 \).

The

---------------

 problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to \( a + b + c = 8 \), where \( 0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9 \). The number of solutions is given by the stars and bars theorem

---------------

:
\[
\binom{8 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{10}{2} = 45
\]

Thus

---------------

, there are **45** valid grids.
