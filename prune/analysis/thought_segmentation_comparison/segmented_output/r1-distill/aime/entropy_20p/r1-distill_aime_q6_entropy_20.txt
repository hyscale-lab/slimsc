Okay, so I've got this problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue, each with equal probability. The

---------------

 question is about finding the probability that after coloring, there's a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the

---------------

 red ones were originally, and vice versa. They mention that the probability will be m/n where m and n are coprime, and I

---------------

 need to find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to parse this. So each vertex is colored red or blue independently

---------------

 with a 50-50 chance. The octagon has eight vertices. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8 =

---------------

 256. That's the denominator of our probability.

Now, the numerator is the number of colorings where there

---------------

 exists a rotation such that when you rotate the octagon, all the blue vertices move to positions that were originally red, and the

---------------

 red ones move to where the blues were. So, essentially, after rotation, blue becomes red and red becomes blue. So

---------------

, it's like a perfect swapping of colors via rotation.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of transformations. The octagon has

---------------

 rotational symmetry. The group of rotations is cyclic of order 8, right? So, the rotations are by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., up to 315°,

---------------

 corresponding to rotation by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 positions.

So, for each rotation, say

---------------

 by k positions, we can check whether the coloring is such that when you rotate by k, the color at each vertex is

---------------

 flipped. That is, if the original color was red, it becomes blue, and vice versa.

But wait, the problem says

---------------

 that "all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, it's not necessarily that

---------------

 every blue vertex becomes red, but rather that when you rotate, every blue vertex moves to a spot that was red. So

---------------

, if you have a blue vertex at position i, after rotating by k, it's at position (i + k) mod 8, and that

---------------

 position was originally red.

But in the problem statement, it's the rotated octagon such that all blue vertices end up where

---------------

 there were originally red. So, for the rotated octagon, the blue vertices are exactly the red ones in the original.

---------------

 So, the rotated coloring is the complement of the original coloring.

Wait, that's an important point. So, the rotated

---------------

 version of the coloring is the complement of the original. That is, if C is the original coloring, then rotating C by k gives

---------------

 the complement of C.

So, mathematically, for each vertex i, color(i + k) = not color(i),

---------------

 where the addition is modulo 8.

So, the condition is that for some rotation k, the coloring is such that every

---------------

 vertex i has color(i + k) = 1 - color(i). Since colors are binary, red is 0 and blue is 1, or

---------------

 vice versa, doesn't matter as long as we're consistent.

So, how do we count such colorings? Let's denote

---------------

 the rotation by k steps, so k can be from 0 to 7. For each k, we can check how

---------------

 many colorings satisfy the condition that rotating by k gives the complement.

But we need to be careful because some colorings might satisfy this condition for multiple k

---------------

's. So, we can't just add up the counts for each k because that would overcount.

Alternatively, perhaps we

---------------

 can model this as a system of equations. For each vertex i, color(i + k) = 1 - color(i). Let

---------------

's write this as color(i + k) + color(i) = 1.

But since this must hold for all i, the

---------------

 coloring must satisfy a kind of linear recurrence.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Since the octagon is regular, the rotations form

---------------

 a group, and we can use group theory or Burnside's lemma or something similar. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively

---------------

, maybe think about the coloring as a binary string of length 8, and the rotation by k steps corresponds to shifting the string.

---------------

 The condition is that the shifted string is the bitwise complement of the original string.

So, the problem reduces to finding the number of binary strings of

---------------

 length 8 such that for some k, shifting the string by k positions results in the complement of the original string.

Hmm

---------------

, that's an interesting way to think about it. So, how many such binary strings are there?

Let me try to

---------------

 model this. Let me denote the original string as s = s0 s1 s2 ... s7, where each si is 0 or 1. The

---------------

 shifted string by k positions is s' = sk sk+1 ... s7 s0 s1 ... sk-1. We

---------------

 require that s' is the complement of s, so for all i, s'i = 1 - si.

So, for

---------------

 all i, sk + i = 1 - s_i, where the indices are modulo 8.

Wait, that's

---------------

 the same as s_{(i + k) mod 8} = 1 - s_i for all i.

So

---------------

, let's write this as s_{i + k} = 1 - s_i for all i.

This is a system

---------------

 of equations that the string s must satisfy.

Now, for each k, the system is:

s_{i + k} = 1 - s_i for

---------------

 i = 0, 1, ..., 7.

But we have to remember that (i + k) mod 8 is

---------------

 another index, so the equations are cyclic.

So, for each k, we can see if this system has solutions, and then

---------------

 count the number of solutions.

Wait, but for each k, we can think of the system as a linear recurrence. Let

---------------

 me see.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the orbit structure. Since shifting by k steps, the octagon is partitioned into cycles.

---------------

 Each cycle is a set of vertices that are mapped onto each other by repeated shifts of k.

The number of such cycles is equal

---------------

 to the greatest common divisor of k and 8, right? Because the number of cycles is gcd(k, 8).

---------------

 So, for example, if k=1, gcd(1,8)=1, so there's one cycle of length 8. If k=2, gcd(2,8)=2, so two cycles of length 4,

---------------

 etc.

Wait, yes, the number of cycles is d = gcd(k,8), and each cycle has length 8/d.

So

---------------

, in each cycle, the system of equations requires that s_{i + k} = 1 - s_i.

But

---------------

 since in each cycle, the indices wrap around, this imposes certain constraints.

Let me take an example. Suppose k=1.

---------------

 Then, the cycle is the whole octagon. So, s1 = 1 - s0, s2 = 1 - s1 = s0, s3 = 1 - s2 = 1 - s0, and

---------------

 so on. So, we get a pattern where s0, s2, s4, s6 are all equal, and s1, s3, s5, s7 are their

---------------

 complements.

So, for k=1, the coloring must alternate between two colors every step. But since 8 is even, this

---------------

 is possible. So, the number of such colorings is 2: all red and blue alternating starting with red, or starting with blue.



---------------

Wait, but in our case, the colors can be any combination as long as the condition holds. So, for k=1, the

---------------

 system reduces to s_{i+1} = 1 - s_i for all i. So, the coloring is forced

---------------

 to be alternating red and blue.

So, for k=1, the number of colorings is 2: one starting

---------------

 with red, the other starting with blue.

Similarly, for k=2. Let's see. Let's take k=2,

---------------

 so d = gcd(2,8)=2, so there are two cycles, each of length 4.

So, each

---------------

 cycle is i, i+2, i+4, i+6. So, for each cycle, we have s

---------------

_{i+2} = 1 - s_i, and s_{i+4} = 1 - s_{i+2} = s_i, and s_{i+6} = 1 - s_{i+4} = 1 - s_i.

So

---------------

, for each cycle, the coloring alternates every two steps. So, s0, s2, s4, s6 must

---------------

 satisfy s2 = 1 - s0, s4 = 1 - s2 = s0, s6 = 1 - s4 = 1 - s0.



---------------

Similarly, for the other cycle, s1, s3, s5, s7 must satisfy s3 = 1 - s1, s5 = 1 - s3 = s1, s7 = 1 - s5 = 1 - s1.

So

---------------

, each cycle is determined by the value of s0 and s1. Each cycle can independently choose s0 and s1,

---------------

 which then determine the rest of the cycle.

So, for each cycle, we have 2 choices (s0 can be 0 or 1, and

---------------

 s1 can be 0 or 1). So, the total number of colorings for k=2 is 2 *

---------------

 2 = 4.

Wait, but let's verify. For each cycle, we have two independent bits, s0 and s1, each

---------------

 can be 0 or 1. Then, the rest are determined. So, yes, 2^2 =4 color

---------------

ings for k=2.

Similarly, for k=3. Let's see: gcd(3,8)=1, so the

---------------

 entire octagon is one cycle.

So, s_{i+3} = 1 - s_i for all i. So

---------------

, let's try to write down the implications.

Starting with s0, s3 = 1 - s0.

s3 =

---------------

 1 - s0, so s6 = 1 - s3 = s0.

s6 = s0, so

---------------

 s1 = 1 - s6 = 1 - s0.

s1 = 1 - s0, so s4 = 1 - s1 = s0.

s4 = s0, so s7 = 1 - s4 = 1 - s0.

s7 = 1 - s0, so s2 = 1 - s7 = s0.

s2 = s0, so s5 = 1 - s2 = 1 - s0.

s

---------------

5 = 1 - s0, so s8 = 1 - s5 = s0. But s8 is s0,

---------------

 which is consistent.

So, the entire coloring is determined by s0. So, s0 can be 0 or 1,

---------------

 and all other s_i are determined based on s0.

So, the number of colorings is 2 for k=3.

Similarly

---------------

, for k=4. Let's compute gcd(4,8)=4. So, the number of cycles is 4, each of length 2.

Each

---------------

 cycle is i, i+4. So, for each cycle, s_{i+4} = 1 - s_i.

Therefore

---------------

, in each cycle, the two elements must be different. So, for each cycle, we have two choices: s_i =

---------------

 0, s_{i+4}=1 or s_i=1, s_{i+4}=0.

Since

---------------

 there are four cycles, each independent, the total number of colorings is 2^4 = 16.

Wait

---------------

, but let me think. Each cycle has two elements, and they must be different. So, for each cycle, 

---------------

2 choices. So, with four cycles, 2^4=16 colorings.

Similarly, for k=5.

---------------

 gcd(5,8)=1, so it's a single cycle. So, similar to k=3.

So, s

---------------

_{i+5} = 1 - s_i for all i.

So, let's see:

s5 = 1 - s0



---------------

s0 = 1 - s5 = 1 - (1 - s0) = s0. So, no

---------------

 problem.

s_{10} mod 8 is s2 = 1 - s5 = s0

s_{

---------------

15} mod8 is s7 = 1 - s2 = 1 - s0

s_{20} mod8 is s4 = 1 - s7 = s0

s_{25} mod8 is s1 = 1 - s4 = 1 - s0

s_{30} mod8 is s6 = 1 - s1 = s0

s_{35} mod8 is s3 = 1 - s6 = 1 - s0

s_{40} mod8 is s0 = 1 - s3 = 1 - (1 - s0) = s0.



---------------

So, all equations are consistent, and the coloring is determined by s0. So, two colorings for k=5.

Similarly, for k=6.

---------------

 gcd(6,8)=2. So, two cycles, each of length 4.

Each cycle is i, i+6, i+4

---------------

, i+2.

Wait, let's confirm: starting with i=0: 0,6,4,2.



---------------

i=1:1,7,5,3.

So, for each cycle, the four elements must satisfy s_{i+6} = 1 - s_i.

So

---------------

, for the first cycle: 0,6,4,2.

s6 = 1 - s0

s4 = 1 - s6 = 1 - (1 - s0) = s0

s2 = 1 - s4 = 1 - s0

s

---------------

0 = 1 - s2 = 1 - (1 - s0) = s0. Consistent.

Similarly, for

---------------

 the second cycle: 1,7,5,3.

s7 = 1 - s1

s5 = 1 - s7 = s1

s3 = 1 - s5 = 1 - s1

s1 = 1 - s3 = 1 - (1 - s1) = s1. Consistent.

So, each

---------------

 cycle is determined by s0 and s1, respectively. So, for each cycle, two choices (s0 and s1 can

---------------

 be 0 or 1). So, total colorings is 2^2 =4 for k=6.

For

---------------

 k=7. gcd(7,8)=1, so single cycle.

s_{i+7} = 1 - s_i.



---------------

So, similar to k=1,3,5. Let's see:

s7 = 1 - s0

s6 = 1 - s7 = s0

s5 = 1 - s6 = 1 - s0

s4 = 1 - s5 = s0

s3 = 1 - s4 = 1 - s0

s2 = 1 - s3 = s0

s1 = 1 - s2 = 1 - s0

s0 = 1 - s1 = 1 - (1 - s0) = s0.

---------------

 Consistent.

So, again, the entire coloring is determined by s0, so two colorings for k=7.

Finally

---------------

, k=0. That's the identity rotation. So, the condition is s_i = 1 - s_i for all i,

---------------

 which implies s_i = 0.5, which is impossible since s_i is either 0 or 1. So, no

---------------

 colorings satisfy the condition for k=0.

So, summarizing:

k | gcd(k,8) | Number of color

---------------

ings for this k
---|---------|---------------------------
0 | 1       | 0
1 | 1       | 2
2 | 2       | 4
3 | 1       | 2
4 | 4       | 16
5 | 1       | 2
6 | 2       | 4
7 | 1       | 2

So

---------------

, total colorings that satisfy the condition for some k is 0 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 16 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 

---------------

32.

Wait, 2+4=6, +2=8, +16=24, +2=26, +4=30, +2=32. So

---------------

, 32 colorings.

But wait, but this counts colorings that satisfy the condition for multiple k's multiple times. So

---------------

, we have overcounted.

For example, a coloring that works for k=1 and k=3 would be counted twice.

---------------

 So, to get the correct count, we need to use inclusion-exclusion, accounting for overlaps.

But this seems complicated.

---------------

 Maybe another approach is to consider that a coloring that works for some rotation is equivalent to the coloring being a fixed point under some

---------------

 rotation composed with the complement operation.

Wait, perhaps we can think in terms of group actions. The group of rotations acts on the set of colorings, and we're

---------------

 looking for colorings that are fixed by some group element combined with the complementation.

But maybe this is getting too abstract.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a necklace counting problem, where we want necklaces that are equivalent to their complement under some rotation.

But

---------------

 I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: For a coloring to satisfy the condition for some rotation k, it must be

---------------

 that the coloring is equal to its complement under rotation by k. So, the coloring is a fixed point of the rotation composed

---------------

 with complementation.

So, the group element is rotation by k, and the transformation is complementation.

Wait, but each

---------------

 rotation is an element of the cyclic group C8, and complementation is an automorphism of the colorings.

So, the

---------------

 group action is the combination of rotation and complementation.

But maybe it's getting too complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the total number of such

---------------

 colorings is equal to the number of colorings fixed by at least one group element (rotation and complementation).

But maybe

---------------

 Burnside's lemma can help here. Let me recall Burnside's lemma: the number of orbits is equal to the average number of fixed points.

But I

---------------

'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Wait, in our case, each coloring can be fixed by some rotation k

---------------

 and complementation. So, the number of such colorings is equal to the number of colorings fixed by some rotation and

---------------

 complementation.

So, the total number is the union over all k of the fixed colorings under rotation by k and complementation.

But

---------------

 inclusion-exclusion would be needed, which is complicated.

Alternatively, maybe we can think about the total number of colorings that

---------------

 are fixed by some rotation and complementation.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the number of colorings that satisfy the condition for some

---------------

 k, considering that different k's may lead to overlapping colorings.

Wait, but maybe the only colorings that satisfy the condition for multiple k's are the color

---------------

ings that are fixed under multiple transformations.

Wait, for example, the all-red and all-blue colorings: would they satisfy the condition for

---------------

 some k?

Wait, let's think about the all-red coloring. If we rotate by any k, the coloring remains all-red. The

---------------

 complement of all-red is all-blue, so unless the rotation transforms all-red into all-blue, which is only possible if all

---------------

-red is equal to all-blue, which is impossible. So, all-red and all-blue colorings are not counted here.

Wait

---------------

, but the only colorings that are counted are those that are not symmetric in that way.

Wait, but earlier, for

---------------

 k=4, the number of colorings was 16. Let me think about those. For k=4, each

---------------

 pair (i, i+4) must be colored oppositely. So, for each of the four pairs, we

---------------

 can choose either red or blue for the first element, and the other is determined. So, 2^4=16 color

---------------

ings. These are the colorings where opposite vertices are colored oppositely.

Similarly, for k=2 and k=6, which

---------------

 have two cycles each of length 4, each cycle has two choices, so 4 colorings each.

Wait, but

---------------

 now, are any of these colorings fixed under multiple k's? For example, a coloring fixed under both k=2 and k=4.



---------------

Wait, let's see: If a coloring is fixed under both k=2 and k=4, then it must satisfy both

---------------

 the condition for k=2 and k=4. But let's see what that implies.

If a coloring is fixed under k=4, then

---------------

 s_i and s_{i+4} are complements. If it's also fixed under k=2, then s_i and s_{i+2} are complements.



---------------

So, s_{i+4} = 1 - s_i, and s_{i+2} = 1 - s_i.



---------------

Then, s_{i+4} = 1 - s_i = s_{i+2}.

But s_{i+4} =

---------------

 s_{i+2 + 2} = 1 - s_{i+2} = 1 - (1 - s_i) = s_i.

So

---------------

, s_{i+4} = s_i.

But earlier, we have s_{i+4} = 1 - s_i.

---------------

 So, s_i = 1 - s_i, which implies s_i = 0.5, which is impossible.

---------------

 So, the only colorings that are fixed under both k=2 and k=4 are those that don't exist.

---------------

 So, no overlap.

Wait, but maybe another example: a coloring fixed under k=1 and k=3. Wait

---------------

, but if a coloring is fixed under k=1, it's an alternating coloring. If it's also fixed under k=3, what

---------------

 does that imply?

An alternating coloring has s_{i+1} = 1 - s_i. So, s_{i+3} = 1 - s_{i+2} = 1 - (1 - s_{i+1}) = s_{i+1} = 1 - s_i.

So

---------------

, s_{i+3} = 1 - s_i, which is consistent with the condition for k=3.

---------------

 So, in fact, any alternating coloring is fixed under both k=1 and k=3 and k=5 and k=7.

---------------

 Because shifting by any odd k would result in the same condition.

Wait, so the two alternating colorings (starting with red or blue) are fixed under all odd k's.

---------------

 So, these colorings are counted multiple times in our initial count.

So, in our initial count, for k=1,3

---------------

,5,7, each contributes 2 colorings, but all of these are the same two colorings. So, in

---------------

 reality, the two alternating colorings are each counted four times in the initial total of 32.

Similarly, for other

---------------

 k's, maybe some colorings are fixed under multiple k's.

So, to get the correct count, we need to subtract

---------------

 the overlaps.

This is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to compute the total number of colorings fixed under any rotation and

---------------

 complementation, using inclusion-exclusion.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a linear algebra problem.

Each condition s_{i + k} = 1 - s_i is

---------------

 a linear equation over GF(2), except that it's over integers mod 2, but with a twist because it's 

---------------

1 - s_i, which is equivalent to s_{i +k} + s_i = 1 mod 2.

So

---------------

, for each rotation k, the system of equations is s_{i +k} + s_i = 1 for all i.

This

---------------

 is a system of 8 equations, but they are not all independent.

The number of solutions is 2^{8 - rank}, where rank is the rank of the system.

But perhaps

---------------

 the system has a certain structure.

Alternatively, maybe we can model it as a graph, where each vertex is connected to its

---------------

 shifted version, and the equations form a set of constraints.

But perhaps another angle: For each rotation k, the system s

---------------

_{i +k} + s_i = 1 must hold for all i.

So, in terms of linear algebra, the

---------------

 matrix for the system would have 1's on the main diagonal and the k-th shifted diagonal, with the rest 0's

---------------

, and the right-hand side is all 1's.

But solving such a system might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 we can note that for each rotation k, the number of colorings that satisfy the condition is 2^{c}, where c is the number of independent

---------------

 cycles.

Wait, earlier, we saw that for k=1, the number of solutions is 2, which is 2^

---------------

1, as the system has one independent equation.

Wait, no, for k=1, the system is s_{i+1} + s_i = 1 for all i.

---------------

 But this is a single equation because s0 + s1 =1, s1 + s2=1, etc., which

---------------

 all collapse to s0 = s2 = s4 = s6 and s1 = s3 = s5 = s7,

---------------

 with s0 + s1 =1. So, two solutions.

Similarly, for k=2, the system is s_{i+2} + s_i =1 for

---------------

 all i. So, each pair (s0, s2), (s1, s3), etc., must satisfy s_i

---------------

 + s_{i+2}=1. So, each pair is independent, leading to 2^4 =16 solutions,

---------------

 but wait, no, earlier we saw for k=2, it was 4 solutions. Hmm, maybe my earlier approach

---------------

 was wrong.

Wait, no, wait. For k=2, the system is s_{i+2} = 1 - s_i.

---------------

 So, the system is s_{i+2} + s_i =1.

But for each cycle, this is a

---------------

 system that alternates every two steps. So, for a cycle of length 4, the system would be s0 + s2 =1, s2 + s4=1, s4 + s6=1, s6 + s0=1. But

---------------

 this is a system of equations:

s0 + s2 =1

s2 + s4=1

s4 + s6=1

s6 + s0=1

If

---------------

 we add all equations, 2(s0 + s2 + s4 + s6) =4, so s0 + s2 + s4 + s6=2.

But

---------------

 each individual equation is s_{i+2} =1 - s_i.

So, s0, s2, s4, s6 must

---------------

 alternate between two values. So, for a cycle of length 4, s0 determines s2=1 - s0, s4=1 - s2=s

---------------

0, s6=1 - s4=1 - s0, and then s0=1 - s6=

---------------

1 - (1 - s0)=s0, which is consistent. So, each cycle is determined by s0,

---------------

 which can be 0 or1, so 2 possibilities.

Since there are two such cycles for k=2, the

---------------

 total number of colorings is 2^2=4.

So, that's correct.

Similarly, for k=4, the

---------------

 cycles are of length 2, so each cycle has two elements, which must be complements. So, for each cycle, two

---------------

 possibilities, leading to 2^4=16.

So, in general, for each k, the number of color

---------------

ings is 2^{d}, where d is the number of cycles.

Wait, no. For k=2, d

---------------

=gcd(2,8)=2, so two cycles, each of length 4. But the number of colorings was

---------------

 4=2^2. Similarly, for k=4, d=4 cycles, each of length 2, number

---------------

 of colorings is 2^4=16.

Wait, yes, so in general, for each k, the number of colorings is 2^{d

---------------

}, where d is the number of cycles, which is gcd(k,8).

Wait, no, for k=1, d

---------------

=1, so 2^1=2 colorings. For k=3, d=1, so 2 color

---------------

ings. For k=5,7, same. So, yes, for each k, the number of colorings is 2^{gcd(k,8)}.

Wait

---------------

, but for k=2, the number of colorings was 4=2^2, which is 2^{gcd(2,8)}=2^2=

---------------

4. Similarly, k=4, 2^4=16. So, yes, that seems to hold.

So

---------------

, the formula is that for each k, the number of colorings is 2^{gcd(k,8)}.

So

---------------

, to compute the total number of colorings fixed by at least one rotation, we can sum over k=0 to 7 the

---------------

 number of colorings fixed by rotation k, which is 2^{gcd(k,8)}.

But wait, no,

---------------

 because we have to consider that the colorings fixed by multiple k's are being counted multiple times.

So, the total number

---------------

 is not just the sum, but the inclusion-exclusion over all k's.

But that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we

---------------

 can think of the total number as the sum over k of μ(k) * 2^{gcd(k,8)}, where μ is the

---------------

 Möbius function. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the principle from combinatorics that the number of color

---------------

ings fixed by at least one group element is equal to the sum over the group of the number of fixed colorings, divided by the size of the group.

---------------

 But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can use Möbius inversion here.

Wait, the total number of colorings fixed

---------------

 by some rotation is equal to the sum_{d|8} μ(d) * something.

Wait, maybe not. Let

---------------

 me think differently.

The problem is similar to counting the number of binary necklaces of length 8 that are equal to their complement under some rotation.

In

---------------

 combinatorics, a necklace is an equivalence class of colorings under rotation. But in our case, we're not considering

---------------

 equivalence classes; we're considering colorings that are fixed by some rotation composed with complementation.

Wait, perhaps another approach:

---------------

 for each divisor d of 8, consider the number of colorings that are periodic with period d and satisfy the condition.



---------------

But maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the total number of colorings is equal to the sum over all divisors d of 

---------------

8 of φ(d) * 2^{d}, where φ is Euler's totient function.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I

---------------

 think I need to compute the number of colorings fixed by at least one rotation k, considering that each rotation k contributes 2^{gcd(k,8)} colorings, but with

---------------

 overlaps.

But this is similar to the problem of counting the number of binary strings fixed by some rotation, which is a classic necklace

---------------

 counting problem.

In the necklace problem, the number of aperiodic necklaces is given by Möbius inversion. But

---------------

 in our case, the condition is more complex because it's not just fixed by rotation, but fixed by rotation and complementation.

Wait

---------------

, perhaps it's better to model this as a group action. The group is C8, the cyclic group of order 8, acting on the set of colorings.

---------------

 But each group element is combined with complementation.

Wait, but complementation is an involution (applying it twice gives

---------------

 the identity). So, the group is actually the dihedral group, which includes rotations and reflections. But in our case, the

---------------

 complementation is a global operation, not a reflection.

Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps think of the problem as color

---------------

ings that are fixed under some rotation followed by complementation.

In that case, the group is C8, and the transformation

---------------

 is rotation by k and then complementation. So, for each k, we can define an automorphism T_k: s_i →

---------------

 1 - s_{(i -k) mod 8}.

Then, the fixed colorings under T_k are those color

---------------

ings s such that s_i = 1 - s_{(i -k) mod 8} for all i.

Which is equivalent

---------------

 to s_{(i +k) mod8} = 1 - s_i for all i.

Which is exactly the condition we had

---------------

 earlier.

So, the number of fixed colorings under T_k is 2^{gcd(k,8)}.

So, to

---------------

 compute the total number of colorings fixed by at least one T_k, we can use inclusion-exclusion over the group.



---------------

But in group theory, the number of elements fixed by at least one group element can be computed using the formula:

Total = sum

---------------

_{g} fix(g) - sum_{g1 < g2} fix(g1 ∩ g2) + sum_{g1 < g2 < g3} fix(g1 ∩ g2 ∩ g3)

---------------

 - ... 

But this is complicated for a group of size 8.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use Burnside's lemma,

---------------

 but I'm not sure.

Wait, Burnside's lemma counts the number of orbits, which is equal to the average number of fixed points. But in

---------------

 our case, we want the total number of colorings fixed by at least one group element, not the number of orbits.

Wait

---------------

, but Burnside's lemma says that the number of orbits is equal to (1/|G|) * sum_{g ∈ G} fix(g).

---------------

 So, the average number of fixed colorings per group element is equal to the number of orbits.

But we don't know

---------------

 the number of orbits. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of the total number of colorings fixed by at least one group element as equal

---------------

 to the sum_{g ∈ G} fix(g) minus the sum over pairs, etc., but this inclusion-exclusion is

---------------

 complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps note that the only colorings fixed by multiple group elements are the all-red and all-blue, but in

---------------

 our case, those are not fixed because their complements are all-blue and all-red, respectively, which are different.

Wait, no

---------------

. Wait, all-red coloring: if you rotate it by any k, it's still all-red. Its complement is all-blue. So, unless

---------------

 all-red is equal to all-blue, which it isn't, the all-red coloring is not fixed under any T_k.

---------------

 Similarly for all-blue.

So, the only colorings fixed under T_k are those non-trivial colorings.

Wait, but

---------------

 earlier, for k=1,3,5,7, the number of fixed colorings is 2, which are the two alternating colorings.

---------------

 These are fixed under all T_k where k is odd.

Similarly, for k=2,6, the fixed colorings are the

---------------

 ones with two alternating colors every two steps, which are fixed under T_2 and T_6.

Similarly, for k=4, the fixed colorings are those with

---------------

 opposite vertices colored oppositely, fixed under T_4.

So, these colorings are fixed under multiple T_k's.

So

---------------

, the two alternating colorings are fixed under T_1, T_3, T_5, T_7.

The

---------------

 four colorings for k=2 and k=6 are fixed under T_2 and T_6.

The 16 colorings for k=4 are fixed under T_4.

So

---------------

, to compute the total number of colorings fixed by at least one T_k, we can take the union over all fixed

---------------

 colorings.

But since some colorings are fixed under multiple T_k's, we have to subtract the overlaps.

So, using

---------------

 inclusion-exclusion:

Total = sum fix(T_k) - sum fix(T_k ∩ T_{k'}) + sum fix(T_k ∩ T_{k'} ∩ T_{k''}) - ... 

But this

---------------

 is going to get very complicated because there are many overlaps.

But perhaps we can compute the total number as follows:

First, sum

---------------

 over all k: fix(T_k) = sum_{k=0}^7 2^{gcd(k,8)}.

But

---------------

 for k=0, fix(T_0) = 0, as we saw earlier.

For k=1,3

---------------

,5,7: each contributes 2 colorings.

For k=2,6: each contributes 4 colorings.

For k=4: contributes 16 colorings.

So, total

---------------

 sum is 0 + 2 + 4 + 2 +16 + 2 +4 +2 = 32.

But this

---------------

 counts colorings that are fixed under multiple T_k's multiple times.

So, we need to subtract the colorings fixed under the

---------------

 intersection of two T_k's.

So, for example, colorings fixed under both T_1 and T_3.



---------------

But if a coloring is fixed under T_1 and T_3, what does that imply?

Fixed under T_1: s_{i+1} = 1 - s_i.

Fixed under T_3: s_{i+3} = 1 - s_i.

But

---------------

 from T_1, s_{i+1} = 1 - s_i.

Then, s_{i+3} = s_{i+2 +1} = 1 - s_{i+2} = 1 - (1 - s_{i+1}) )

---------------

 = s_{i+1} = 1 - s_i.

Which is consistent with T_3. So, any

---------------

 coloring fixed under T_1 is automatically fixed under T_3, T_5, T_7.

Similarly, the

---------------

 two alternating colorings are fixed under all T_k with odd k.

So, the intersection of fix(T_1) and fix(T_3) is fix(T_1), which has 

---------------

2 colorings.

Similarly, the intersection of fix(T_1) and fix(T_2) would be colorings fixed under both T_1 and T_2.

But

---------------

 what does that imply?

If a coloring is fixed under T_1 and T_2, then:

From T_1: s_{i+1} = 1 - s_i.

From T_2: s_{i+2} = 1 - s_i.

But

---------------

 from T_1: s_{i+2} = s_{i+1 +1} = 1 - s_{i+1} = 1 - (1 - s_i) = s_i.

But from T_2: s_{i+2} = 1 - s_i.

So, s_i = 1 - s_i,

---------------

 which implies s_i = 0.5, which is impossible. So, the intersection of fix(T_1) and fix(T_2) is empty.

Similarly, the

---------------

 intersection of fix(T_2) and fix(T_6) would be colorings fixed under both T_2 and T_6.

But

---------------

 T_2 and T_6 are related because T_6 is T_{-2}.

So, if a coloring is fixed under T_2 and T_6, what

---------------

 does that imply?

From T_2: s_{i+2} = 1 - s_i.

From T_6: s_{i+6} = 1 - s_i.

But s_{i+6} = s_{i + 2*3} = (

---------------

1 - s_{i + 2*2}) = 1 - s_{i +4} = 1 - (1 - s_{i +2

---------------

}) ) = s_{i +2} = 1 - s_i.

Which is consistent. So, the colorings fixed under both T_2 and T_6 are the

---------------

 same as those fixed under T_2. So, the intersection is fix(T_2), which has 4 colorings.

Wait

---------------

, but wait, if a coloring is fixed under T_2, then it's automatically fixed under T_6, since

---------------

 T_6 is T_2 composed with T_4 (since 2+4=6, but not sure if

---------------

 that's accurate). Alternatively, since T_6 is the inverse of T_2, because 2 + 6 =8 �

---------------

�0 mod8. So, T_6 is the inverse of T_2. So, if a coloring is fixed under T_2, it

---------------

's also fixed under T_6.

So, the intersection of fix(T_2) and fix(T_6) is fix(T_2), which has 4 colorings.

Similarly, the

---------------

 intersection of fix(T_4) with any other fix(T_k) would be fix(T_4), since T_4 is of

---------------

 order 2, and any rotation by k=4 composed with itself gives identity.

Wait, no. Let's see,

---------------

 if a coloring is fixed under T_4 and T_2, what does that imply?

From T_4: s_{i+4} =1 - s_i.

From T_2: s_{i+2} =1 - s_i.

But

---------------

 then, s_{i+4} = (s_{i+2}) + something. Wait, s_{i+4} =1

---------------

 - s_i, and s_{i+2}=1 - s_i. So, s_{i+4}=s

---------------

_{i+2}.

But s_{i+4} = s_{i+2} implies that the coloring is periodic with period 2.

---------------

 But from T_2, s_{i+2}=1 - s_i. So, combining these, s_{i+4}=s

---------------

_{i+2}=1 - s_i, and s_{i+4}=1 - s_i. So, it

---------------

's consistent.

But then, s_{i+2} =1 - s_i and s_{i+4}=1 - s_i.

---------------

 So, s_{i+2}=s_{i+4}, which is consistent with the period.

So, the color

---------------

ings fixed under both T_2 and T_4 are the same as those fixed under T_2, which are 4 colorings.

Similarly

---------------

, the colorings fixed under T_4 and T_1 would be the intersection of fix(T_4) and fix(T_1).

---------------

 But fix(T_1) is the two alternating colorings, which are not fixed under T_4 because T_4 would

---------------

 require s_{i+4}=1 - s_i. But for the alternating colorings, s_{i+4}=s_i.

---------------

 So, s_i =1 - s_i → s_i=0.5, impossible. So, the intersection is empty.

So

---------------

, the overlaps are only within certain subsets.

This is getting quite involved. Maybe instead of trying to compute the exact number via

---------------

 inclusion-exclusion, which is complicated, I can instead note that the only colorings that are fixed under multiple T_k's are:



---------------

- The two alternating colorings, fixed under all T_k where k is odd.

- The four colorings fixed under T_2 and T_6.

- The 16 colorings fixed under T_4.

But

---------------

 these sets are mostly disjoint except for overlaps where colorings satisfy multiple conditions.

Wait, for example, are any of the color

---------------

ings fixed under T_4 also fixed under T_2?

A coloring fixed under T_4 has s_{i+4}=1 - s_i.



---------------

A coloring fixed under T_2 has s_{i+2}=1 - s_i.

So, if a coloring is fixed under both, then s

---------------

_{i+2}=1 - s_i and s_{i+4}=1 - s_i.

But s_{i+4}=s_{i+2 +2}=1 - s_{i+2}=1 - (1 - s_i)=s_i.

But s

---------------

_{i+4}=1 - s_i, so s_i=1 - s_i, which implies s_i=0.5, impossible. So, no

---------------

 overlap between fix(T_4) and fix(T_2).

Similarly, the two alternating colorings are not in fix(T_4),

---------------

 as we saw earlier.

So, the only overlaps are within the fix(T_1), fix(T_3), etc., which

---------------

 all share the same two colorings.

Similarly, fix(T_2) and fix(T_6) share the same four colorings.

So

---------------

, the total number of colorings fixed by at least one T_k is:

Number of colorings fixed by any T_k = |

---------------

fix(T_1) ∪ fix(T_2) ∪ fix(T_3) ∪ ... ∪ fix(T_7)|.

Using

---------------

 inclusion-exclusion:

= sum |fix(T_k)| - sum |fix(T_k) ∩ fix(T_{k'})| + sum |fix(T_k) ∩ fix(T_{k'}) ∩ fix(T_{k''})| - ... 

But

---------------

 this is going to be complicated because there are many terms.

But perhaps we can compute the first few terms.

First, sum

---------------

 |fix(T_k)| = 0 + 2 + 4 + 2 +16 + 2 +4 +2 = 32.

Now

---------------

, subtract the intersections. The intersections can be of two types:

1. Intersections of fix(T_k) where k is

---------------

 odd: fix(T_1) ∩ fix(T_3) = fix(T_1), which has 2 colorings.

Similarly, fix

---------------

(T_1) ∩ fix(T_5) = fix(T_1), etc. So, how many such intersections are there?

There

---------------

 are C(4,2)=6 intersections among the four odd k's. Each intersection is fix(T_1), which has 2 colorings. So

---------------

, total for these is 6 * 2 =12.

2. Intersections of fix(T_2) and fix(T_6): fix

---------------

(T_2) ∩ fix(T_6) = fix(T_2), which has 4 colorings. So

---------------

, 1 intersection, contributing 4.

3. Intersections between fix(T_odd) and fix(T_2 or T_6):

---------------

 For example, fix(T_1) ∩ fix(T_2). As we saw earlier, this intersection is empty.

---------------

 So, each such intersection contributes 0.

Similarly, any intersection between fix(T_odd) and fix(T_4) is empty.

4

---------------

. Intersections of fix(T_2) with itself: Not applicable since we're considering distinct pairs.

5. Intersections of

---------------

 fix(T_4) with others: As above, these are empty.

So, total intersections to subtract are 12 (from odd

---------------

 k's) + 4 (from T_2 and T_6) =16.

Now, moving to the next term:

---------------

 sum of intersections of three fix(T_k)'s.

Again, similar reasoning:

1. Intersections among three fix(T_odd)'s: Each

---------------

 such intersection is fix(T_1), which has 2 colorings. The number of such intersections is C(4,3)=4, each contributing 2.

---------------

 So, total 4*2=8.

2. Intersections involving fix(T_2) and two fix(T_odd)'s: For

---------------

 example, fix(T_1) ∩ fix(T_3) ∩ fix(T_2). As before, fix

---------------

(T_1) ∩ fix(T_2)=empty, so the intersection is empty.

3. Similarly, intersections involving fix(T_2) and fix(T_6) with another fix(T_odd): The

---------------

 intersection would be empty.

4. Intersections involving fix(T_4) with others: These are empty.

So, total for

---------------

 three-way intersections is 8.

Next term: sum of intersections of four fix(T_k)'s.

1. Intersections of all four fix(T_odd)'s: This

---------------

 is fix(T_1), which has 2 colorings. Only 1 such intersection.

2. Other four-way intersections involving

---------------

 fix(T_2), fix(T_6), or fix(T_4) would be empty.

So, total four-way intersections:

---------------

 2.

Now, higher-order intersections (five or more fix(T_k)'s) would also be empty, as the

---------------

 intersections beyond four are already empty.

Putting it all together:

Total = sum fix(T_k) - sum |fix(T_k) ∩ fix(T_{k'})| + sum |fix(T_k) ∩ fix(T_{k'}) ∩ fix(T_{k''})| - sum

---------------

 |fix(T_k) ∩ ... | + ...

So,

Total = 32 - 16 + 8 - 2 =

---------------

 32 -16=16; 16+8=24; 24-2=22.

Wait, is

---------------

 that correct? Let me double-check:

First term: 32

Subtract second term (intersections of two fix

---------------

(T_k)'s): 16

Add back third term (intersections of three fix(T_k)'s):8

---------------



Subtract fourth term (intersections of four fix(T_k)'s):2

So, 32 -16=

---------------

16; 16+8=24; 24-2=22.

So, the total number of colorings fixed by at least one T_k is 22.

But

---------------

 wait, earlier I thought the total was 32, but after inclusion-exclusion, it's 22.

But

---------------

 let's see: 32 (sum fix(T_k)) -16 (sum pairwise intersections) +8 (sum triple intersections) -2 (sum four-way

---------------

 intersections) = 22.

But is this the correct count? Let me think.

We have:

- 2 colorings fixed under all odd k's.



---------------

- 4 colorings fixed under T_2 and T_6.

- 16 colorings fixed under T_4.

But

---------------

 these sets are mostly disjoint except for overlaps within the odd k's.

Wait, the 2 colorings are fixed under all odd k's.

---------------

 The 4 colorings under T_2 and T_6 are separate. The 16 colorings under T_4 are separate.



---------------

So, the total colorings would be 2 +4 +16=22. Which matches our inclusion-exclusion result.

So, the

---------------

 total number is 22.

But wait, earlier, when we summed all fix(T_k), we got 32, which counts

---------------

 overlaps multiple times. So, inclusion-exclusion reduces it to 22.

So, the number of colorings that satisfy the condition is

---------------

 22.

But wait, let me verify with another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the number is 22, but

---------------

 let me think about the possible colorings:

- 2 colorings fixed under T_1, T_3, T_5, T_7.



---------------

- 4 colorings fixed under T_2 and T_6.

- 16 colorings fixed under T_4.

But

---------------

 these sets are pairwise disjoint except for the 2 colorings which are fixed under T_1, etc., but they are

---------------

 not in the other sets.

So, total colorings: 2 +4 +16=22.

Yes, that makes

---------------

 sense.

So, the number of colorings is 22.

But wait, wait a second. The problem says that

---------------

 the probability is m/n, where m and n are coprime. So, the total number of colorings is 256.



---------------

So, the probability is 22/256. Simplify that: divide numerator and denominator by 2,

---------------

 11/128.

So, m=11, n=128, which are coprime.

---------------

 So, m +n=139.

Wait, but hold on. Earlier, I thought the number of colorings was

---------------

 22, but I need to make sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in inclusion-exclusion. Let me recount

---------------

.

The inclusion-exclusion formula for the union is:

|A1 ∪ A2 ∪ ... ∪ An| = Σ|Ai| - Σ|Ai ∩ Aj| + Σ|Ai ∩ Aj ∩ Ak| - ... + (-1)^{n+1} |A1 ∩ A2 ∩ ... ∩ An}|.

In our case, the

---------------

 sets Ai are fix(T_k) for k=0 to7, but fix(T_0)=0, so we can ignore it.

So, the

---------------

 sets are fix(T_1), fix(T_2), fix(T_3), fix(T_4), fix(T_5), fix(T_6), fix(T_7).



---------------

So, n=7 sets.

So, the first term is sum |Ai|: 2+4+2+16+2+4+2=32.

Second term: sum |Ai ∩ Aj| for

---------------

 i<j.

There are C(7,2)=21 intersections.

But many of them are empty.

Let me categor

---------------

ize the intersections:

1. Intersections among fix(T_odd): There are C(4,2)=6 intersections. Each intersection

---------------

 is fix(T_1), which has 2 colorings.

2. Intersections between fix(T_2) and fix(T_6): 

---------------

1 intersection, which is fix(T_2), 4 colorings.

3. Intersections between fix(T_odd) and fix(T_2):

---------------

 Each of these is empty, as we saw earlier. There are 4*1=4 such intersections.

4. Intersections between fix(T_odd) and fix(T_4): Each

---------------

 is empty. 4*1=4 intersections.

5. Intersections between fix(T_2) and fix(T_4): Empty

---------------

, as we saw earlier. 1 intersection.

6. Intersections between fix(T_6) and fix(T_4): Empty,

---------------

 as fix(T_6) is same as fix(T_2). 1 intersection.

7. Intersections between fix(T_5

---------------

) and fix(T_6): Empty. 1 intersection.

Wait, actually, this is getting too messy. Let me instead

---------------

 compute all pairwise intersections:

- fix(T_1) ∩ fix(T_2): empty.

- fix(T_1) ∩ fix(T_3): fix(T_1),

---------------

 2.

- fix(T_1) ∩ fix(T_4): empty.

- fix(T_1) ∩ fix(T_5): fix(T_1), 2.

- fix(T_1) ∩ fix(T_6): empty.

- fix(T_1) ∩ fix(T_7): fix(T_1), 2.

Similarly:



---------------

- fix(T_2) ∩ fix(T_3): empty.

- fix(T_2) ∩ fix(T_4): empty.

- fix(T_2) ∩ fix(T_5): empty.

- fix(T_2) ∩ fix(T_6): fix(T_2),4.

- fix(T_2) ∩ fix(T_7): empty.

-

---------------

 fix(T_3) ∩ fix(T_4): empty.

- fix(T_3) ∩ fix(T_5): fix(T_3),

---------------

2.

- fix(T_3) ∩ fix(T_6): empty.

- fix(T_3) ∩ fix(T_7): fix(T_3),2.

-

---------------

 fix(T_4) ∩ fix(T_5): empty.

- fix(T_4) ∩ fix(T_6): empty.

- fix(T_4) ∩ fix(T_7): empty.

- fix(T_5) ∩ fix(T_6): empty.

- fix(T_5) ∩ fix(T_7): fix(T_5),2.

- fix(T_6) ∩ fix(T_7): empty.

So

---------------

, now, counting the non-empty intersections:

- fix(T_1) ∩ fix(T_3):2

- fix(T_1) ∩ fix(T_5):2

- fix(T_1) ∩ fix(T_7):2

- fix(T_2) ∩ fix(T_6):4

- fix(T_3) ∩ fix(T_5):2

- fix(T_3) ∩ fix(T_7):2

- fix(T_5) ∩ fix(T_7):2

So

---------------

, total non-empty intersections: 2+2+2+4+2+2+2=16.

So

---------------

, sum |Ai ∩ Aj|=16.

Third term: sum |Ai ∩ Aj ∩ Ak| for

---------------

 i<j<k.

Again, categorizing:

1. Intersections among three fix(T_odd)'s: Each such intersection is fix(T_1), which has 2 colorings. The

---------------

 number of such intersections is C(4,3)=4.

2. Intersections involving fix(T_2), fix(T_6), and a

---------------

 fix(T_odd): For example, fix(T_1) ∩ fix(T_2) ∩ fix(T_3)=

---------------

empty.

3. Intersections involving fix(T_4) and others: These are empty.

So, total for three-way intersections:4 *

---------------

2=8.

Fourth term: sum |Ai ∩ Aj ∩ Ak ∩ Al| for i<j<k<l.

Only

---------------

 one such intersection: fix(T_1) ∩ fix(T_3) ∩ fix(T_5) ∩ fix(T_7)=fix(T_1), which has 2 colorings.

So

---------------

, sum four-way intersections=2.

Now, higher-order intersections (five or more) are empty.

Putting it all together:

Total =

---------------

 32 (first term) -16 (second term) +8 (third term) -2 (fourth term) = 

---------------

32 -16=16; 16+8=24; 24-2=22.

So, the

---------------

 total number of colorings fixed by at least one T_k is 22.

Thus, the probability is 22/256.

---------------

 Simplify this fraction:

Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 11/128.

11 and 128 are coprime,

---------------

 so m=11, n=128. Thus, m +n=139.

Wait, but earlier

---------------

 when I thought about the colorings fixed under each k, I thought the total was 22, which aligns with this calculation

---------------

. So, I think this is correct.

So, the answer is 139.


The probability that a randomly colored regular octagon can be rotated such

---------------

 that all blue vertices align with original red vertices is $\frac{11}{128}$. Therefore, $m + n = 11 + 128 = 139$.

$\boxed{139}$<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
