Okay, so I have this problem here: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, let

---------------

's see. I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but maybe I can convert these logarithmic equations into exponential form to make it

---------------

 easier. Let me write down the given equations.

First equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. 



---------------

I know that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So applying that here, it becomes

---------------

 x^10 = y^x. Okay, that's one equation.

Second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

Again

---------------

, converting that, it becomes y^10 = x^{4y}. So now I have two equations:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

I

---------------

 need to solve for x and y, both greater than 1, and then find their product.

Hmm, these are exponential

---------------

 equations with variables in both the base and the exponent. That seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can take logarithms again

---------------

 or find a way to relate x and y.

Let me write down the equations again:

1. x^10 = y^x


---------------

2. y^10 = x^{4y}

I wonder if I can express y in terms of x from the first equation and substitute it into the second equation

---------------

. Let's try that.

From equation 1: x^10 = y^x.

Taking natural log on both sides:

---------------

 10 ln x = x ln y.

So, ln y = (10 ln x) / x.

Similarly

---------------

, from equation 2: y^10 = x^{4y}.

Taking natural log on both sides: 10 ln y = 4y ln x.

So

---------------

, ln y = (4y ln x) / 10 = (2y ln x)/5.

Wait, so

---------------

 from equation 1, I have ln y = (10 ln x)/x, and from equation 2, ln y = (2y ln x)/5.

Since

---------------

 both equal ln y, I can set them equal to each other.

So, (10 ln x)/x = (2y ln x)/5.

Hmm

---------------

, I can cancel ln x from both sides because x and y are greater than 1, so ln x is positive and

---------------

 not zero.

So, 10/x = (2y)/5.

Let's solve for y.

Multiply both sides by x: 10 = (2y x)/5.

Multiply both sides by 5: 50 = 2y

---------------

 x.

Divide both sides by 2: 25 = y x.

So, xy = 25.

---------------

 Hmm, that seems straightforward. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, so from equation

---------------

 1, I had ln y = (10 ln x)/x, and from equation 2, ln y = (2y ln x)/5.

Setting

---------------

 them equal: 10/x = (2y)/5.

Yes, that's correct. Then 10/x = 2y/5.



---------------

Multiply both sides by 5x: 50 = 2xy.

Divide both sides by 2: 25 = xy. So xy

---------------

 is 25. So the product is 25.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Maybe I should

---------------

 find the actual values of x and y to ensure that they satisfy both equations.

Let me denote xy = 25.

---------------

 So y = 25/x.

Now, substitute y =25/x into equation 1: x^10 = y^x.



---------------

So, x^10 = (25/x)^x.

Hmm, that's x^10 = (25^

---------------

x)/(x^x).

Multiply both sides by x^x: x^{10 + x} = 25^x.

Take

---------------

 natural log: (10 + x) ln x = x ln 25.

Hmm, not sure if that helps

---------------

 directly. Maybe I can express it as (10 + x)/x = ln25 / lnx.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 another approach. Let me take equation 1: x^10 = y^x. And since y =25/x, substitute

---------------

 that in.

So, x^10 = (25/x)^x.

Which is x^10 = (

---------------

25^x)/(x^x).

Multiply both sides by x^x: x^{10 + x} =25^x.

So

---------------

, x^{10 + x} =25^x.

Taking both sides to the power of 1/x: x^{(10 + x)/x} =25.

S

---------------

implify the exponent: x^{1 + 10/x} =25.

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful yet

---------------

. Let me try taking the natural logarithm of both sides.

(10 + x) ln x = x ln25.

Hmm

---------------

, let's write that as:

(10 + x) ln x = x ln25.

Let me rearrange:



---------------

10 ln x + x ln x = x ln25.

Bring all terms to one side:

10 ln x + x ln x - x ln25 =0.

Factor x

---------------

:

10 ln x + x(ln x - ln25)=0.

Hmm, maybe factor ln x:

ln x (10 + x) - x ln25=0.

Alternatively

---------------

, maybe express as:

10 ln x = x (ln25 - ln x).

Wait, that might not directly

---------------

 help. Maybe I can write it as:

10 ln x = x ln(25/x).

Wait, that's

---------------

 interesting because from earlier, we had ln y = (10 ln x)/x, and since y =25/x, ln

---------------

 y = ln(25/x). So let's see.

From equation 1, we had ln y = (10 ln x)/x.



---------------

But y =25/x, so ln y = ln(25/x) = ln25 - lnx.

So

---------------

, ln25 - ln x = (10 ln x)/x.

So, let's write that equation:

ln25 - ln x = (10 ln x)/x.

Multiply

---------------

 both sides by x:

x ln25 - x ln x =10 ln x.

Bring all terms to left:



---------------

x ln25 - x ln x -10 ln x=0.

Factor ln x:

x ln25 - ln x (x +10)

---------------

 =0.

So, x ln25 = ln x (x +10).

Hmm, perhaps we can write this

---------------

 as:

ln25 / ln x = (x +10)/x.

Which is the same as:

ln(25)/ln x

---------------

 = 1 + 10/x.

Alternatively, let me denote t = ln x. Then, ln25 =

---------------

 t * (x +10)/x.

But x is e^t, so x = e^t. So

---------------

 substituting that:

ln25 = t * (e^t +10)/e^t = t*(1 + 10 e^{-t}).

Hmm

---------------

, that seems complicated. Maybe it's better to try to find x numerically or see if there's an integer solution.

Wait

---------------

, let's see if x=5 works. Because 25 is 5 squared, and if x=5, then

---------------

 y=25/5=5. So x=y=5.

Let's check if that satisfies the original equations.

First equation: log_

---------------

5(5^5) = log_5(3125) =5. But wait, the equation says

---------------

 it's equal to 10. So that doesn't work.

Hmm, so x=5 is not a solution.

---------------

 Hmm.

Wait, maybe x=25? Then y=25/25=1. But y has to be greater than 1, so y

---------------

=1 is invalid.

Hmm, what about x=25^(1/ something)?

Wait, perhaps x and y are the

---------------

 same? Let me test if x=y.

If x=y, then from equation 1: log_x(x^x)=x.

---------------

 But the equation says it's equal to 10, so x=10. Then y=10, and

---------------

 xy=100.

But let's check the second equation: log_y(x^{4y})=log_10(10^{40})=40,

---------------

 but it's supposed to be 10. So that doesn't work either.

So, x and y can't be the

---------------

 same. So scratch that idea.

Hmm, maybe I can take the ratio of the two equations. Let me think.

Wait

---------------

, from equation 1: x^10 = y^x.

From equation 2: y^10 =x^{4y}.

So

---------------

, let's take the ratio of equation 1 to equation 2.

(x^10)/(y^10) = (y^x)/(x^{4y}).

S

---------------

implify left side: (x/y)^10.

Right side: y^x / x^{4y} = (y^

---------------

x)/(x^{4y}) = (y/x)^{4y} * y^{x -4y}.



---------------

Wait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, express both sides with same base.

Wait, perhaps better to write both equations

---------------

 in terms of exponents.

Wait, from equation 1: x^10 = y^x.

From equation 2: y^10 =x^{4y}.

Let

---------------

 me write equation 1 as y = x^{10/x}.

Then substitute this into equation 2: (x^{10/x})^10 = x^{4y}.

S

---------------

implify left side: x^{100/x} =x^{4y}.

Since the bases are same and x>1, the

---------------

 exponents must be equal.

So, 100/x =4y.

But from earlier, we had xy=25,

---------------

 so y=25/x.

Substitute into 100/x =4*(25/x).

So, 100/x =1

---------------

00/x.

Which is an identity. Hmm, so that doesn't give any new information.

So, that suggests that as

---------------

 long as xy=25, these equations hold. But wait, that can't be because when I tried x=5, y

---------------

=5, which gives xy=25, but it doesn't satisfy the original equations.

So, perhaps there are multiple

---------------

 solutions with xy=25, but only specific x and y satisfy both equations.

Wait, so maybe I need another equation

---------------

 to find x and y.

Wait, from earlier steps, we had:

From equation 1: ln y = (10 ln x)/x.

From equation 2: ln y = (2y ln x)/5.

Setting

---------------

 them equal, we get (10 ln x)/x = (2y ln x)/5.

Which led us to xy

---------------

=25.

So, that's one equation, but we have two variables. So we need another equation.

But wait

---------------

, in the process, we used both equations to get to that point. So perhaps the only condition is xy=25,

---------------

 but then when we plug back in, we might have to find the specific x and y.

Wait, perhaps we can write

---------------

 the equations in terms of each other.

From equation 1: x^10 = y^x.

From equation 2: y^10 =x^{4y}.

Let

---------------

 me take equation 1 and raise both sides to the power of y: (x^10)^y = (y^x)^y =>

---------------

 x^{10y} = y^{xy}.

Similarly, from equation 2, take both sides to the power of x: (y^10)^x = (x^{4y})^x => y^{10x} = x^{4xy

---------------

}.

Now, we have:

x^{10y} = y^{xy}  --> Equation 3.

y^{10x} = x^{4xy} --> Equation 4.

Hmm

---------------

, perhaps we can take equation 3 and substitute into equation 4.

Wait, equation 3: x^{10y} = y^{xy}.

Take

---------------

 natural log: 10y ln x = xy ln y.

Divide both sides by y (since y>1, y

---------------

≠0): 10 ln x =x ln y.

Wait, but that's exactly equation 1. So that

---------------

's consistent.

Similarly, equation 4: y^{10x} =x^{4xy}.

Take natural log:10x ln y=4xy ln x.

Divide both sides by x:10 ln y =4y ln x.

Which

---------------

 is the same as equation 2. So, again, consistent.

So, perhaps we can't get more information this way.



---------------

Wait, maybe I can express equation 1 and equation 2 as ratios.

Equation 1: x^10 = y^x.

Equation 2: y^10 =x^{4y}.

Let

---------------

 me take equation 1 and raise both sides to the power of 10: (x^10)^10 = (y^x)^10 =>

---------------

 x^{100}= y^{10x}.

But from equation 2, y^{10} =x^{4y}

---------------

.

So, y^{10x} = (y^{10})^x = (x^{4y})^x =x^{4y

---------------

 x}.

So, from above, x^{100}=x^{4y x}.

Since x>1, the

---------------

 exponents must be equal: 100=4y x.

But from earlier, we have xy=25,

---------------

 so 4y x=4*25=100. So that's consistent.

So, that doesn't give

---------------

 new info.

Hmm, maybe I need to consider the earlier equation where I substituted y=25/x into equation 1 and

---------------

 got to x^{10 +x}=25^x.

Wait, let's write that again:

x^{10 +x}=25^x.

Take

---------------

 both sides to the power of 1/x:

x^{(10 +x)/x} =25.

S

---------------

implify the exponent:

x^{1 + 10/x}=25.

Let me write this as:

x * x^{10/x}=25.

Hmm

---------------

, maybe take natural log of both sides:

ln(x) + (10/x) ln x = ln25.

Which

---------------

 is:

ln x (1 + 10/x )= ln25.

So,

ln x = ln25 / (1 + 10/x).



---------------

But from earlier, we had ln y = (10 ln x)/x, and y=25/x.

Wait

---------------

, maybe this is going in circles.

Alternatively, let me let t = x^{1/x}.

Wait, because in

---------------

 the equation x^{1 + 10/x}=25, I can write it as x * (x^{1/x})^10=

---------------

25.

So, x*(t)^10=25, where t= x^{1/x}.

Hmm

---------------

, I don't know if that helps. Maybe take logs.

Wait, ln(x) +10*(ln x)/x = ln25.

Which

---------------

 is the same as:

ln x (1 +10/x )= ln25.

Hmm, not helpful yet.

Wait

---------------

, let me write 1 +10/x as (x +10)/x.

So,

ln x * (x +10)/x = ln25.

So

---------------

,

ln x = (ln25 *x )/(x +10).

Hmm, I can write this as:

ln x = [

---------------

ln25 * x ] / (x +10).

Let me denote this as equation A.

Similarly, from equation

---------------

 1, ln y = (10 ln x)/x.

But y=25/x, so ln y = ln(25) - ln x.

So

---------------

,

ln(25) - ln x = (10 ln x)/x.

So,

ln25 = ln x + (10 ln x)/x.

Factor

---------------

 ln x:

ln25 = ln x (1 +10/x).

Which is the same as equation A.

So

---------------

, no new info again.

Hmm, this seems tricky. Maybe I can make a substitution.

Let me let u = ln

---------------

 x.

Then, equation A becomes:

u = (ln25 * e^u )/(e^u +10).

Wait

---------------

, because x = e^u, so 1/x = e^{-u}.

Wait, wait, actually, let

---------------

 me substitute x = e^u.

Then,

From equation A:

u = (ln25 * e^u )/(e^u +10).

Multiply

---------------

 both sides by (e^u +10):

u (e^u +10) = ln25 * e^u.

Bring

---------------

 all terms to left:

u e^u +10u - ln25 e^u =0.

Factor e^u:

e^u (u - ln25) +10u =0.

Hmm, not

---------------

 sure if that helps.

Alternatively, rearrange:

u (e^u +10) = e^u ln25.

Div

---------------

ide both sides by e^u:

u (1 +10 e^{-u}) = ln25.

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 this can be expressed as:

u = ln25 / (1 +10 e^{-u}).

This looks like

---------------

 a transcendental equation, which might not have a closed-form solution. So, maybe I need to solve it numerically.

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps we can make an intelligent guess for u.

Let me assume that u is a multiple of ln5, since 25 is 5^

---------------

2.

Let me try u=2 ln5, which is ln25.

So, let me test u= ln

---------------

25.

Left side: u = ln25.

Right side: ln25/(1 +10 e^{-ln

---------------

25}).

Compute denominator: 1 +10 e^{-ln25} =1 +10*(1/25)=1 + 

---------------

10/25=1 +0.4=1.4.

So right side: ln25 /1.4 �

---------------

� (3.2189)/1.4 ≈2.299.

But u= ln25≈3.2189≠

---------------

2.299. So that doesn't work.

Wait, maybe u= ln5≈1.609.

Compute

---------------

 right side: ln25/(1 +10 e^{-ln5}).

Compute e^{-ln5}=1/5=0.2.

So denominator=1+10*

---------------

0.2=1+2=3.

So, right side= ln25 /3 ≈3.2189/3≈1.073.

But

---------------

 u= ln5≈1.609≠1.073.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, try

---------------

 u= ln10≈2.3026.

Compute right side: ln25/(1 +10 e^{-ln10}).

e^{-ln10}=1/10=0.1.

Denominator=1+10*0.1=1+1=2.

Right

---------------

 side= ln25/2≈3.2189/2≈1.609.

But u= ln

---------------

10≈2.3026≠1.609.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps u

---------------

= something else.

Wait, let me think. Maybe u= ln(25/ something). Not sure.

Alternatively, let

---------------

 me make a table of u and right side.

u | RHS= ln25/(1 +10 e^{-u})



---------------

Let me compute for u=2:

RHS= ln25/(1 +10 e^{-2})=3

---------------

.2189/(1 +10*(0.1353))=3.2189/(1+1.353)=3.2189/2.353≈1.368

---------------

.

u=2: RHS≈1.368.

u=1.5:

RHS=3.2189/(1 +10 e^{-1.5})=3.2189/(1 +10*(0.2231))=3.2189/(1 +2.231)=3.2189/3.231≈0.996.

u

---------------

=1.5: RHS≈0.996.

u=1.7:

RHS=3.2189/(1 +10 e^{-1.7})

---------------

=3.2189/(1 +10*(0.1827))=3.2189/(1 +1.827)=3.2189/2.827≈1.138.

Wait

---------------

, so when u=1.5, RHS≈0.996 <u.

When u=1.7, RHS≈1.138 <

---------------

u.

Wait, but u is increasing from 1.5 to 1.7, RHS also increases but less than

---------------

 u.

Wait, maybe trying higher u.

u=2.5:

RHS=3.2189/(1 +10 e^{-2.5})=3.2189/(1 +10*(0.0821))=3.2189/(1+

---------------

0.821)=3.2189/1.821≈1.767.

Which

---------------

 is less than u=2.5.

Wait, but RHS is increasing as u increases, but not as fast as u.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the solution is when u= RHS.

So, when u=1.5, RHS=0.996 <

---------------

1.5.

At u=1.7, RHS=1.138 <1.7.

At u=2

---------------

, RHS=1.368 <2.

Wait, but at u=ln25≈3.2189:



---------------

RHS= ln25/(1 +10 e^{-ln25})= ln25/(1 +10*(1/25))= ln

---------------

25/(1 +0.4)= ln25/1.4≈2.299.

Which is less than u=

---------------

3.2189.

Wait, so perhaps the function f(u) = ln25/(1 +10 e^{-u}) is

---------------

 always less than u for u>0. So, does that mean that the equation u = f(u) has no solution?



---------------

But that can't be, because we have the problem statement that such x and y exist. So maybe I made a mistake in

---------------

 the earlier steps.

Wait, let me retrace.

We have:

From equation 1: x^10 = y^x.



---------------

From equation 2: y^10 =x^{4y}.

We set ln y = (10 ln x)/x and

---------------

 ln y = (2y ln x)/5, leading to (10/x)=(2y)/5, so xy

---------------

=25.

So, that's correct.

Then, substituting y=25/x into equation 1: x^10=(

---------------

25/x)^x.

Which is x^{10 +x}=25^x.

So, x^{1

---------------

0 +x}=25^x.

Which is (x^{1 + 10/x})^x=25^x.

So

---------------

, x^{1 +10/x}=25.

So, x^{1 +10/x}=25.

Hmm

---------------

, perhaps I can take both sides to the power of something.

Alternatively, let me write x^{1 +10/x}=25.



---------------

Let me write 25 as 5^2.

So, x^{1 +10/x}=5^2.

Hmm

---------------

, can I find x such that x is a power of 5? Let's say x=5^k.

Let

---------------

 me try x=5^k.

Then, equation becomes:

(5^k)^{1 +10/(5^k)}=5^2.

Which

---------------

 is 5^{k(1 +10/(5^k))}=5^2.

So, the exponents must be equal:

k(1 +10/(5^k))=2.

So

---------------

, k + 10k/(5^k)=2.

Hmm, let's test k=1:

1 +10(

---------------

1)/5=1 +2=3≠2.

k=2:

2 +10*2/(25)=2 +2

---------------

0/25=2 +0.8=2.8≠2.

k=0.5:

0.5 +10*(

---------------

0.5)/sqrt(5)=0.5 +5/(2.236)≈0.5 +2.236≈2.736≠2.

k=1

---------------

. Let's see, we saw k=1 gives 3. What about k=0. Let's see, but

---------------

 x>1, so k>0.

Wait, perhaps k= something else.

Wait, let me rearrange:

k + (

---------------

10k)/(5^k) =2.

Let me denote f(k)=k + (10k)/(5^k).

---------------

 We need f(k)=2.

Compute f(0.8):

k=0.8.

5^0.8≈5^(4/5)= (

---------------

5^{1/5})^4≈(1.379)^4≈3.568.

So, 

---------------

10k/(5^k)=10*0.8/3.568≈8/3.568≈2.24.



---------------

So, f(0.8)=0.8 +2.24≈3.04>2.

Hmm

---------------

, need smaller f(k).

k=0.6:

5^0.6≈5^(3/5)= (5^{1/5})^3≈(

---------------

1.379)^3≈2.605.

10k/(5^k)=10*0.6/2.605≈6/2.605≈2.303

---------------

.

f(k)=0.6 +2.303≈2.903>2.

Still too high.

k=0.4:

5^0.4≈sqrt

---------------

(5^0.8)=sqrt(3.568)=≈1.889.

10k/(5^k)=10*0.4/1.889≈4/1.889≈2.113

---------------

.

f(k)=0.4 +2.113≈2.513>2.

Closer.

k=0.3:

5^0.3≈e

---------------

^{0.3 ln5}≈e^{0.3*1.609}=e^{0.4827}≈1.620

---------------

.

10k/(5^k)=10*0.3/1.620≈3/1.620≈1.852.

f(k)=0.3 +1.852≈2.152>2.

Almost

---------------

 there.

k=0.25:

5^0.25≈sqrt(sqrt(5))≈1.495.

10k/(5^k)=10*0.25/1.495≈2.5/1.495≈1.671

---------------

.

f(k)=0.25 +1.671≈1.921<2.

So,

---------------

 f(k) crosses 2 between k=0.25 and k=0.3.

Let me try k=0.28:

5^0.28≈e^{0.28*

---------------

1.609}=e^{0.4505}≈1.568.

10k/(5^k)=10*0.28/1.568≈2.8/1.568≈1.786

---------------

.

f(k)=0.28 +1.786≈2.066>2.

k=0.27:

5^0.27≈e^{0.27*1.609}=e^{0.4344

---------------

}≈1.544.

10k/(5^k)=10*0.27/1.544≈2.7/1.544≈1.747

---------------

.

f(k)=0.27 +1.747≈2.017>2.

Close.



---------------

k=0.26:

5^0.26≈e^{0.26*1.609}=e^{0.418}

---------------

≈1.519.

10k/(5^k)=10*0.26/1.519≈2.6/1.519≈1.711

---------------

.

f(k)=0.26 +1.711≈1.971<2.

So,

---------------

 between k=0.26 and k=0.27.

Using linear approximation:

At k=0.26, f=1.971.

At k=0.27, f=2.017.

We need f(k)=2.



---------------

Difference between k=0.26 and 0.27 is 0.01, f increases by ~

---------------

0.046.

We need to cover 2-1.971=0.029.



---------------

So, fraction=0.029 /0.046≈0.63.

So, k≈0.26 +0.63*0.01≈0.26+

---------------

0.0063≈0.2663.

So, k≈0.2663.

Thus

---------------

, x=5^{0.2663}.

Compute 5^{0.2663}=e^{0.2663 *

---------------

 ln5}=e^{0.2663*1.6094}=e^{0.4284

---------------

}≈1.534.

So, x≈1.534.

Then, y=25/x≈25/1.534≈16.30

---------------

.

Wait, let me check if these approximate values satisfy the original equations.

First equation: log_x(y^x)=1

---------------

0.

Compute y^x:16.30^{1.534}.

Compute ln(16.30^{

---------------

1.534})=1.534 ln16.30≈1.534*2.793

---------------

≈4.294.

So, e^{4.294}=≈74.1.

So, y

---------------

^x≈74.1.

Then, log_x(74.1)= ln74.1 / ln

---------------

 x.

ln74.1≈4.306, ln x≈ln1.534≈0.428.

So, log

---------------

_x(74.1)=4.306/0.428≈10.06.

---------------

 Close to 10.

Second equation: log_y(x^{4y})=10.

Compute x^{4y}=1.534^{4*16.30}=1.534^{65.2}.

Hmm

---------------

, that's a huge number. Let me compute ln(x^{4y})=65.2 ln1.534≈65.2*0.428≈28.0.



---------------

So, x^{4y}=e^{28}≈4.36*10^12.

Then

---------------

, log_y of that is ln(4.36e12)/ln y.

ln y=ln16.30≈2.793.

ln(4.36e12)=ln4.36 +1

---------------

2 ln10≈1.473 +12*2.302≈1.473 +27.624≈29.097.

So, log_y=

---------------

29.097 /2.793≈10.406.

Hmm, that's about

---------------

 10.4, which is close to 10, but not exact. Perhaps the approximation is not precise enough.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe there's an exact solution where x and y are 5 and 5, but that didn't work earlier

---------------

.

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe x and y are such that x=25/y, but that's same

---------------

 as xy=25.

Wait, but perhaps I can express the equations in terms of t=xy=25.



---------------

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use substitution.

Let me consider that equation 1: x^10 = y^x.

Take

---------------

 both sides to the power of 1/x: x^{10/x}=y.

Similarly, equation 2: y^10 =x^{4y}.

Take both sides to the power of 1/(4y): y^{10/(4y)}=x.

But

---------------

 since y= x^{10/x}, substitute into this:

y^{10/(4y)}=x.

So

---------------

, (x^{10/x})^{10/(4y)}=x.

Simplify exponent: (10/x)*(10/(4y))=100/(4xy)=25/(xy).

But from

---------------

 earlier, xy=25, so this becomes 25/25=1.

So, (x^{10/x})^{1

---------------

}=x.

So, x^{10/x}=x.

So, x^{10/x}=x.

Which implies

---------------

 that 10/x=1, because x^a =x implies a=1.

So, 10/x=1 =>

---------------

 x=10.

Ah! So, x=10.

Then, since xy=25, y=25/10=2.5.

So

---------------

, x=10, y=2.5.

Wait, let me check if these satisfy the original equations.

First equation: log_x

---------------

(y^x)=log_10(2.5^{10}).

Compute 2.5^10.



---------------

2.5^2=6.25, 2.5^4=6.25^2=39.0625, 2.5^5=9

---------------

7.65625, 2.5^10=(2.5^5)^2≈(

---------------

97.65625)^2≈9536.743.

So, log_10(9536.743)= log

---------------

10(9.536743e3)=3 + log10(9.536743)

---------------

≈3 +0.979≈3.979≈4, which is not 10. So

---------------

, that's not correct.

Hmm, that contradicts. So, perhaps I made a mistake in that step.

Wait, when

---------------

 I substituted y= x^{10/x} into equation 2, let me double-check.

Equation 2:

---------------

 y^10 =x^{4y}.

Substitute y= x^{10/x}:

(x^{10/x})^10 =x^{4y

---------------

}.

So, x^{100/x}=x^{4y}.

Which implies that 100/x=4y.

But

---------------

 since xy=25, y=25/x.

So, 100/x=4*(25/x)=

---------------

100/x.

Which is an identity. So, no new information.

So, x can be any value such that xy=25,

---------------

 but only specific x and y will satisfy both equations.

Wait, but earlier when I set x^{10/x}=x, I

---------------

 concluded x=10, but that didn't satisfy the original equation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in that substitution

---------------

.

Wait, when I substituted into equation 2, I had:

y^{10/(4y)}=x.

But y

---------------

= x^{10/x}, so:

(x^{10/x})^{10/(4y)}=x.

Which

---------------

 is x^{(10/x)*(10/(4y))}=x.

So, the exponent is (100)/(4xy x

---------------

).

Wait, no, let me compute the exponents correctly.

The exponent is (10/x) multiplied by (10/(4y)).



---------------

Which is (100)/(4x y).

But since xy=25, this is (100)/(4*25)=100/100=1.

So, the

---------------

 exponent is 1, so x^{1}=x.

Which is always true.

So, that doesn't give any new info

---------------

.

Hmm, perhaps I need to accept that the equations reduce to xy=25, but with x and y satisfying x

---------------

^{1 +10/x}=25.

Which is a transcendental equation and can't be solved exactly, but the

---------------

 problem says such numbers exist and asks for xy, which we have as 25.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it

---------------

 says "there exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that..." So, perhaps the answer is 

---------------

25, regardless of the specific x and y.

Wait, but earlier when I tried x=10, y=2.5, the

---------------

 logs didn't equal 10. So, that suggests that even though xy=25, the specific x and y must

---------------

 satisfy the equations, so xy=25 is the answer.

Wait, perhaps the answer is 25, as per

---------------

 the problem's instruction, but the initial step led us to xy=25, regardless of the specific x and y.



---------------

But the problem asks for xy, so maybe the answer is 25, and the specific x and y are not necessary

---------------

.

Wait, but I thought the problem was more complex, but perhaps not. Let me read the problem again.

It says "

---------------

there exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log_x(y^x)=10 and log_y(x^{4y})=10. Find xy."

So

---------------

, from the given, we found that xy=25. So, maybe the answer is 25.

But earlier

---------------

, when I tried x=10 and y=2.5, it didn't satisfy the first equation.

Wait, let

---------------

 me compute log_x(y^x) when x=10, y=2.5.

log_10(2.5^10)=

---------------

 log_10(9536.743)= approximately 3.979, which is not

---------------

 10.

So, that's a problem.

Wait, but according to our earlier steps, we have:

From equation

---------------

 1: x^{10}= y^x.

From equation 2: y^{10}=x^{4y}.

And

---------------

 from these, we derived that xy=25.

But when I assumed x=10, y=2.5, it

---------------

 didn't satisfy equation 1.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that x^{10/x}=x.



---------------

Wait, that was a wrong assumption because when I substituted y= x^{10/x} into equation 2, I

---------------

 ended up with an identity, which only tells me that the substitution is valid, but doesn't give new info.

So, perhaps

---------------

 the only condition is that xy=25, but to find specific x and y, we need to solve the transcendental equation,

---------------

 which we can't do algebraically.

But the problem only asks for xy, which we found as 25.

So

---------------

, perhaps the answer is 25.


Given the problem, we need to find real numbers \( x \) and \( y \), both greater than 1, such that:


---------------

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.
\]
We are

---------------

 to determine the product \( xy \).

### Step 1: Convert Logarithmic Equations to Exponential Form
Using

---------------

 the property \( \log_b(a) = c \iff b^c = a \), we rewrite the given equations:
1. \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) implies

---------------

 \( x^{10} = y^x \).
2. \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \) implies \( y^{10} = x^{4y} \).

### Step 2: Rel

---------------

ate \( x \) and \( y \)
From the first equation, take the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[
10 \ln x = x \ln y \quad \Rightarrow \quad \ln y = \frac{10 \ln x}{x}.
\]
From the second equation, take the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[
10 \ln y = 4y \ln x \quad \Rightarrow \quad \ln y = \frac{2y \ln x}{5}.
\]
Set

---------------

 the two expressions for \( \ln y \) equal:
\[
\frac{10 \ln x}{x} = \frac{2y \ln x}{5}.
\]
Cancel

---------------

 \( \ln x \) (since \( x > 1 \), \( \ln x \neq 0 \)):
\[
\frac{10}{x} = \frac{2y}{5}.
\]
Multiply

---------------

 both sides by \( 5x \):
\[
50 = 2xy.
\]
Divide by 2:
\[
xy = 25.
\]

### Conclusion
The product \( xy \) is \( \boxed{25} \).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
