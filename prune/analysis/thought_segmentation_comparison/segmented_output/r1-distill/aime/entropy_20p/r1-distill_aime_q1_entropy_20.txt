Okay, so I've got this problem here with points O, A, and B. O is at (0,0), A

---------------

 is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). The family

---------------

 F consists of segments PQ of unit length, where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis in the first quadrant. I

---------------

 need to find a point C on AB, different from A and B, that isn't on any other segment from F except AB. Then,

---------------

 compute OC² and express it as a reduced fraction p/q, finally finding p+q.

Hmm. Let me try to visualize this. Points

---------------

 O, A, and B form a triangle in the first quadrant. AB is a line segment connecting A and B. The

---------------

 family F consists of all possible unit-length segments PQ where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis.

---------------

 So, for any point P on the x-axis, Q would be somewhere on the y-axis such that the distance between P and Q is 1.



---------------

Wait, so PQ is a line segment of length 1, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis.

---------------

 So, for each such PQ, the coordinates of P are (p,0) and Q are (0,q), with

---------------

 sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. So, p and q satisfy p² + q² = 1.

---------------

 Since we're in the first quadrant, p and q are positive.

So, the family F is all such segments PQ where

---------------

 p² + q² = 1, p > 0, q > 0. So, F is like a

---------------

 bunch of line segments from the x-axis to the y-axis, each of length 1.

Now, AB is a specific segment connecting

---------------

 A (1/2, 0) and B (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me compute the equation

---------------

 of line AB to help later.

The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation is

---------------

 y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)*(1/2) ??? Wait, let me check.

Wait, when

---------------

 x = 1/2, y = 0. So, plug into point-slope form: y - 0 = -

---------------

sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So, y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2). That

---------------

 makes sense because when x=0, y = sqrt(3)/2, which is point B.

So, equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now

---------------

, the problem says there's a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, we

---------------

 need to find C such that it's on AB and not on any other PQ from F. Then, compute OC².

I

---------------

 think the idea is that for point C on AB, it can only be on the segment AB from family F, and not

---------------

 on any other segment PQ from F. So, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to some curve related to family

---------------

 F.

Wait, the family F is a set of lines. For each PQ in F, it's a straight line from

---------------

 (p,0) to (0,q) where p² + q² =1. So, each PQ is a line

---------------

 in the first quadrant with intercepts (p,0) and (0,q), and p² + q² =1.

Wait

---------------

, so each PQ is a line with equation x/p + y/q =1, where p² + q² =1.

---------------

 So, these are lines with intercepts p on x-axis and q on y-axis, with p² + q²=1.

I

---------------

 remember that the envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So

---------------

, maybe the envelope of family F is a curve, and point C is where AB is tangent to this envelope.

Alternatively, since

---------------

 each PQ is a line, perhaps the envelope is a curve such that each PQ is tangent to it. If that's the case, then the

---------------

 point C where AB is tangent to this envelope would be the unique point on AB that only lies on AB from F and no

---------------

 other.

So, let's try to find the envelope of the family F.

To find the envelope of the family of lines x

---------------

/p + y/q =1 with p² + q² =1.

We can parametrize p and q such that p =

---------------

 cosθ, q = sinθ, since p² + q² =1.

So, the equation of each line can

---------------

 be written as x/cosθ + y/sinθ =1, where θ is between 0 and π/2.



---------------

The envelope is found by solving the system:

x/cosθ + y/sinθ =1,

and the derivative with respect to θ of

---------------

 (x/cosθ + y/sinθ -1) =0.

So, first equation: x secθ + y cscθ =1.

Second equation: derivative with

---------------

 respect to θ is x secθ tanθ - y cscθ cotθ =0.

So, x secθ tanθ = y cscθ cotθ.

S

---------------

implify:

x (1/cosθ)(sinθ/cosθ) = y (1/sinθ)(cosθ/sinθ).



---------------

Simplify both sides:

x (sinθ)/(cos²θ) = y (cosθ)/(sin²θ).

Cross

---------------

-multiplying:

x sinθ * sin²θ = y cosθ * cos²θ.

Which simplifies to x sin³θ = y cos³θ.

So

---------------

, x sin³θ = y cos³θ.

Let me solve for y: y = x (sin³θ)/(cos³θ) = x tan³θ.

So

---------------

, from the first equation, x secθ + y cscθ =1.

Substituting y = x tan³θ into

---------------

 this:

x secθ + (x tan³θ) cscθ =1.

Simplify each term:

x (

---------------

1/cosθ) + x (sin³θ / cos³θ) * (1/sinθ) )=1.

S

---------------

implify the second term: (sin³θ / cos³θ) * (1/sinθ) = sin²θ / cos³θ.

So, equation

---------------

 becomes:

x / cosθ + x sin²θ / cos³θ =1.

Factor x:

x [ 1/cosθ + sin²θ / cos³θ ] =1.

Combine

---------------

 terms inside the brackets:

1/cosθ = cos²θ / cos³θ,

so, [cos²θ + sin²θ]

---------------

 / cos³θ = [1]/cos³θ, since cos²θ + sin²θ=1.

So, the

---------------

 equation becomes x / cos³θ =1.

Thus, x = cos³θ.

Then, from earlier, y = x tan³θ =

---------------

 cos³θ * (sin³θ / cos³θ) )= sin³θ.

So, the envelope is param

---------------

etrized by θ as:

x = cos³θ,

y = sin³θ.

This is the astroid curve

---------------

. The envelope of the family F is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.

Wait

---------------

, let me check: (cos³θ)^(2/3) + (sin³θ)^(2/3) = cos²θ + sin²θ=1.

---------------

 Yes, that's correct. So, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1.

So

---------------

, the astroid is the envelope of the family F. So, each line PQ is tangent to this astroid.

Now

---------------

, the problem is that point C is on AB and not lying on any other segment from F except AB. So, perhaps

---------------

 C is the point where AB is tangent to the astroid.

Because if AB is tangent to the astroid, then C

---------------

 is the point of tangency, which is the only point where AB touches the astroid, and hence, the only point on

---------------

 AB that lies on a segment from F (other than AB itself) would be C. But wait, no, because each

---------------

 PQ is a segment, not the entire line. So, maybe C is the point where AB is tangent to the astroid, so

---------------

 it's the only point on AB that lies on any PQ from F, hence it's the unique point.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 C is the point where AB touches the envelope, meaning it's the only point on AB that lies on any PQ from F,

---------------

 so C can't be on any other PQ except AB.

So, let me find where line AB is tangent to the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1.

The

---------------

 equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

We can substitute this into the astroid equation and

---------------

 find the condition for tangency.

So, substitute y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 into x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.

Let

---------------

 me write that as:

x^(2/3) + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) =1.

This

---------------

 seems complicated, but maybe we can set t = x^(1/3), so x = t^3, and similarly

---------------

 for y.

But perhaps a better approach is to parameterize the astroid and find the tangent line.

Alternatively, compute the derivative of the astroid at

---------------

 a general point and set it equal to the slope of AB.

The astroid is given by x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1. Let

---------------

's differentiate implicitly with respect to x.

(2/3)x^(-1/3) + (2/3)y^(-1/3) dy/dx =0.

So, dy/dx = - [ (

---------------

x^(-1/3)) / (y^(-1/3)) ] = - (y^(1/3)

---------------

 ) / (x^(1/3)).

So, the slope of the tangent to the astroid at point (x,y) is -

---------------

 (y^(1/3) ) / (x^(1/3)).

But the slope of AB is -sqrt(3).

---------------

 So, setting them equal:

- (y^(1/3) ) / (x^(1/3)) = -sqrt(3).



---------------

Simplify:

(y^(1/3))/(x^(1/3)) = sqrt(3).

Raise both sides to the power

---------------

 of 3:

(y)/(x) = (sqrt(3))^3 = 3*sqrt(3).

So, y = 3*sqrt(3) x.

But

---------------

 wait, the line AB has equation y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, the tangent point must

---------------

 satisfy both y = 3*sqrt(3) x and y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Set

---------------

 them equal:

3*sqrt(3)x = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Divide both sides by sqrt(3):

3x = -x + 1/2.

Bring

---------------

 -x to the left:

4x =1/2.

So, x=1/8.

Then, y=3*sqrt(3)*(1/8)= 

---------------

3*sqrt(3)/8.

So, the point of tangency is (1/8, 3*sqrt(3)/8).

Wait

---------------

, but we need to check if this point lies on AB. Let's plug into AB's equation:

y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So

---------------

, plug x=1/8:

y= -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8 +

---------------

 4 sqrt(3)/8) = 3 sqrt(3)/8. Which matches. So, yes, the

---------------

 point (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8) is on AB and is the point where AB is tangent to the astroid.

So

---------------

, this must be the point C we're looking for because it's the only point on AB that lies on a segment from F (

---------------

the tangent point), and thus, it's the unique point on AB that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB.

Now

---------------

, compute OC². OC is the distance from O(0,0) to C(1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).

OC

---------------

² = (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2.

Compute each term:

(1/8)^2 =1/64.

(3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 =9

---------------

*3 /64 =27/64.

Add them: 1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16.

So, OC²=7/16.

---------------

 Therefore, p=7, q=16, which are coprime. So, p+q=23.

Wait

---------------

, but let me double-check that the point (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8) is indeed on

---------------

 AB and on the astroid.

From AB: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

At

---------------

 x=1/8: y= -sqrt(3)/8 + 4 sqrt(3)/8=3 sqrt(3)/8. Correct

---------------

.

On astroid: x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = (1/8)^(2/3) + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^(2/3).

Compute (

---------------

1/8)^(2/3)= (1^(2/3))/(8^(2/3))=1/(4)=

---------------

1/4.

(3 sqrt(3)/8)^(2/3)= (3^(3/2)/8 )

---------------

^(2/3)= [3^(3/2)]^(2/3) / [8]^(2/3)=

---------------

 3^(1) /4=3/4.

So, 1/4 + 3/4=1. Correct.



---------------

So, the point is on the astroid, which is the envelope, so it's the point where AB is tangent to the astroid,

---------------

 hence the unique point C.

Thus, OC²=7/16, so p+q=23.


To

---------------

 solve the problem, we first identify the points \( O(0,0) \), \( A\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right) \), and \( B\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) \). The segment

---------------

 \( \overline{AB} \) has the equation \( y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \).

The family \( \mathcal{F} \) consists of unit

---------------

-length segments \( \overline{PQ} \) with \( P \) on the x-axis and \( Q \) on the y-axis. Each segment satisfies

---------------

 \( p^2 + q^2 = 1 \) for \( P(p, 0) \) and \( Q(0, q) \). The

---------------

 envelope of these segments forms an astroid given by \( x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = 1 \).

To find the unique point \( C \) on \( \overline{AB} \) that does

---------------

 not lie on any other segment from \( \mathcal{F} \) except \( \overline{AB} \), we determine where \( \overline{AB} \) is tangent to the astroid. The

---------------

 slope of \( \overline{AB} \) is \( -\sqrt{3} \), and the tangent condition

---------------

 leads to solving the system:

\[
\begin{cases}
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \\
x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = 1.
\end{cases}
\]

Sub

---------------

stituting \( y \) into the astroid equation and solving, we find the point of tangency \( C \left( \frac{1}{8}, \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} \right) \). The

---------------

 distance \( OC \) is calculated as:

\[
OC^2 = \left( \frac{1}{8} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{64} + \frac{27}{64} = \frac{28}{64} = \frac{7}{16}.
\]

Thus, \( OC^2 = \frac{7}{16} \), and \( p + q = 7 + 16 = 23 \).
