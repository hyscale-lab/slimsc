Okay, so I need to solve this math problem where I have to find the greatest four-digit number N. The property of N is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I need to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000. 

Hmm, let me break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. I need the greatest such number, so I should probably start checking from 9999 downwards until I find a number that satisfies the condition.

The condition is that if any single digit is changed to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. So, for example, if N is abcd (where a, b, c, d are digits), then changing a to 1 gives 1bcd, changing b to 1 gives a1cd, changing c to 1 gives ab1d, and changing d to 1 gives ab11. Each of these should be divisible by 7.

Wait, actually, that

---------------

's not exactly right. Each digit can be changed to 1, regardless of its position. So, for each digit, replacing

---------------

 it with 1 in its place and checking if the new number is divisible by 7.

So, for N = d1 d2 d3 d4, replacing d1 with 1 gives 1 d2 d3 d4, replacing d2 with 1 gives d1 1 d3 d4, replacing d3 with 1 gives d1 d2 1 d4, and replacing d4 with 1 gives d1 d2 d3 1. Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

That

---------------

's a lot of conditions. So, N must be such that all four of these modified numbers are divisible by 7. 



---------------

Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can model each condition mathematically.

Let me denote N as 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits from 0 to 9, and a ≠ 0 because it's a four-digit number.

Now, when we replace a with 1, the number becomes 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. Let's call this number N1.

Similarly, replacing b with 1 gives 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. Let's call this N2.

Replacing c with 1 gives 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d. Let's call this N3.

Replacing d with 1 gives 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1. Let's call this N4.

Each of N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7.

So, N1 ≡ 0 mod 7,

N2 ≡ 0 mod 7,

N3 ≡ 0 mod 7,

N4 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So

---------------

, I can write equations for each of these.

First, N1: 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly,

N2: 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

N3: 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

N4: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, four

---------------

 congruence conditions.

Now, I can compute each of these modulo 7.

First, let's compute the coefficients modulo 7.

1000 mod 7: Let me compute 1000 / 7. 7*142=994, so 1000-994=6. So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

100 mod 7: 100 /7=14*7=98, so 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 mod 7=3.

1 mod 7=1.

So, let

---------------

's rewrite each condition:

N1: 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

N2: 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

N3: 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

N4: 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, four

---------------

 equations:

1. 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

2. 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

3. 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

4. 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Hmm, that

---------------

's four equations with four variables a, b, c, d, but each variable is a digit (0-9, except a which is 1-9).

This

---------------

 seems a bit complex, but maybe I can find relations between them.

Let me see if I can subtract some equations to eliminate variables.

First, let's subtract equation 1 from equation 4.

Equation4: 6a + 2b +3c +1 ≡0.

Equation1: 6 + 2b +3c +d ≡0.

Subtract 1 from 4: (6a +2b +3c +1) - (6 +2b +3c +d) ≡0-0 mod7.

Simplify: 6a +2b +3c +1 -6 -2b -3c -d ≡0.

So, 6a -6 +1 -d ≡0 → 6(a -1) + (1 -d) ≡0 mod7.

Hmm, that's 6(a-1) ≡ (d -1) mod7.

Similarly

---------------

, maybe subtract equation2 from equation4.

Equation4: 6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0.

Equation2:6a +2 +3c +d ≡0.

Subtract 2 from4: (6a +2b +3c +1) - (6a +2 +3c +d) ≡0-0.

Simplify: 2b +1 -2 -d ≡0 → 2b -1 -d ≡0 mod7.

So, 2b -d ≡1 mod7.

So, 2b -d =1 +7k for some integer k.

Similarly, let's subtract equation3 from equation4.

Equation4:6a +2b +3c +1≡0.

Equation3:6a +2b +3 +d≡0.

Subtract3 from4: (6a +2b +3c +1) - (6a +2b +3 +d) ≡0-0.

Simplify:3c +1 -3 -d ≡0 →3c -2 -d ≡0 mod7.

So, 3c -d ≡2 mod7.

So, 3c -d =2 +7m for some integer m.

Now, I have three

---------------

 new equations:

From equation4 - equation1: 6(a-1) ≡ (d -1) mod7. Let's call this equation5.

From equation4 - equation2: 2b -d ≡1 mod7. Equation6.

From equation4 - equation3:3c -d ≡2 mod7. Equation7.

So, equation6: 2b -d ≡1 mod7.

Equation7: 3c -d ≡2 mod7.

So, perhaps I can express d in terms of b and c from these.

From equation6: d ≡2b -1 mod7.

From equation7: d ≡3c -2 mod7.

So, since both equal d, 2b -1 ≡3c -2 mod7.

So, 2b -1 ≡3c -2 →2b ≡3c -1 mod7.

Let me write that as 2b -3c ≡-1 mod7 →2b -3c ≡6 mod7.

So, 2b -3c ≡6 mod7. Equation8.

Now

---------------

, I can perhaps express b in terms of c or vice versa.

But maybe it's easier to find possible values for c and b that satisfy this equation.

Let

---------------

 me try to find b and c such that 2b -3c ≡6 mod7.

So, for each c (0-9), find b such that 2b ≡3c +6 mod7.

Wait

---------------

, 3c +6 mod7 is equivalent to 3(c +2) mod7.

So, 2b ≡3(c +2) mod7.

I

---------------

 can compute 3(c+2) mod7 for c=0 to 6, and then solve for b.

Alternatively, since

---------------

 2 and 7 are coprime, I can multiply both sides by the inverse of 2 mod7. The inverse of 2 mod7 is 4 since 2*4=8≡1 mod7.

So, b ≡4*3(c+2) mod7 → b ≡12(c+2) mod7 →12 mod7 is 5, so b ≡5(c+2) mod7.

So, b ≡5(c+2) mod7.

So, for each c, b is congruent to 5*(c+2) mod7.

Let me compute 5*(c+2) mod7 for c=0 to 6:

c | c+2 | 5*(c+2) | mod7
0 | 2   |10       |3
1 |3    |15       |1
2 |4    |20       |6
3 |5    |25       |4
4 |6    |30       |2
5 |7    |35       |0
6 |8    |40       |5

So, for each c (0-6), b ≡ [

---------------

3,1,6,4,2,0,5] mod7.

So, for example, if c=0, then b ≡3 mod7. So possible b digits are 3 or 10, but since b is a digit, only 3 and 10 is invalid. So b=3 or 10 is

---------------

 too big, so only b=3.

Similarly, for c=1, b≡1 mod7. So b can be 1 or 8 (since 1+7=8).

c=2: b≡6 mod7 → b=6 or 13, but 13 is invalid, so b=6.

c=3: b≡4 mod7 → b=4 or 11 (invalid). So b=4.

c=4: b≡2 mod7 → b=2 or 9.

c=5: b≡0 mod7 → b=0 or7.

c=6: b≡5 mod7 → b=5 or12 (invalid). So b=5.

Wait, but c can be from 0 to 9, but modulo

---------------

7, so for c=7, which is 7 mod7=0, so c=7 would correspond to c=0 in the table above. Similarly, c=8 is c=1, c=9 is c=2.

Wait, maybe

---------------

 I should consider c beyond 6 as well. Because c can be 0-9, so c=7: c mod7=0, so same as c=0. So for c=7, same as c=0, so b≡3 mod7, so b=3 or 10 (invalid). So b=3.

Similarly, c=8: same as c=1, so b≡1 mod7 → b=1 or8.

c=9: same as c=2, so b≡6 mod7 → b=6.

So, now, for each c from 0-9, we have possible b values.

Let me make a table for c=0 to9:

c | mod7 c | b ≡5*(c+2) mod7 | possible b
0 |0       |3 mod7 → b=3,10→3
1 |1       |1 mod7 → b=1,8
2 |2       |6 mod7 →b=6,13→6
3 |3       |4 mod7 →b=4,11→4
4 |4       |2 mod7 →b=2,9
5 |5       |0 mod7 →b=0,7
6 |6       |5 mod7 →b=5,12→5
7 |0       |3 mod7 →b=3,10→3
8 |1       |1 mod7 →b=1,8
9 |2       |6 mod7 →b=6,13→6

So, for each c, the possible b's are:

c=0: b=3

c=1: b=1,8

c=2: b=6

c=3: b=4

c=4: b=2,9

c=5: b=0,7

c=6: b=5

c=7: b=3

c=8: b=1,8

c=9: b=6

So, now, for each possible c (0-9), and for each possible b in the above, I can compute d from equation6: d ≡2b -1 mod7.

And

---------------

 then check if d is a digit (0-9). Also, from equation7: d ≡3c -2 mod7.

So, perhaps I can compute d for each c and b, and then ensure it's a digit.

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps I can express d in terms of b or c.

Wait, from equation6: d=2b -1 mod7.

From equation7: d=3c -2 mod7.

So, for

---------------

 each c and b, d should satisfy both equations.

But since I have the possible b's for each c, I can compute d=2b -1 mod7 and see if it equals 3c -2 mod7.

Wait, let's take an example.

Take c=0: then b=3.

Compute d=2*3 -1=6-1=5 mod7. So d=5 mod7.

Also, from equation7: d=3*0 -2= -2 ≡5 mod7.

So, yes, d=5 mod7. So d can be 5 or 12, but since d is a digit, d=5.

So for c=0, b=3, d=5.

Similarly, take c=1: possible b=1 and 8.

For b=1: d=2*1 -1=1 mod7. So d=1.

Check equation7: d=3*1 -2=1 mod7. So yes, d=1.

For b=8: d=2*8 -1=16-1=15≡1 mod7. So d=1.

Equation7: d=3*1 -2=1 mod7. So yes, d=1.

So for c=1, both b=1 and b=8 give d=1.

Similarly, c=2: b=6.

d=2*6 -1=12-1=11≡4 mod7.

Equation7: d=3*2 -2=6-2=4 mod7. So d=4.

So, c=2, b=6, d=4.

c=3: b=4.

d=2*4 -1=8-1=7 mod7→0.

Equation7: d=3*3 -2=9-2=7≡0 mod7. So d=0.

c=4: possible b=2 and9.

For b=2: d=2*2 -1=4-1=3 mod7.

Equation7: d=3*4 -2=12-2=10≡3 mod7. So yes, d=3.

For b=9: d=2*9 -1=18-1=17≡3 mod7. So d=3.

So, c=4, b=2 or9, d=3.

c=5: possible b=0 and7.

For b=0: d=2*0 -1= -1≡6 mod7.

Equation7: d=3*5 -2=15-2=13≡6 mod7. So yes, d=6.

For b=7: d=2*7 -1=14-1=13≡6 mod7. So d=6.

c=5, b=0 or7, d=6.

c=6: b=5.

d=2*5 -1=10-1=9≡2 mod7.

Equation7: d=3*6 -2=18-2=16≡2 mod7. So yes, d=2.

c=6, b=5, d=2.

c=7: same as c=0, so b=3.

d=2*3 -1=5 mod7.

Equation7: d=3*7 -2=21-2=19≡5 mod7. So d=5.

c=7, b=3, d=5.

c=8: same as c=1, so b=1 or8.

For b=1: d=2*1 -1=1 mod7.

Equation7: d=3*8 -2=24-2=22≡1 mod7. So yes, d=1.

For b=8: d=2*8 -1=15≡1 mod7. So d=1.

c=8, b=1 or8, d=1.

c=9: same as c=2, so b=6.

d=2*6 -1=11≡4 mod7.

Equation7: d=3*9 -2=27-2=25≡4 mod7. So d=4.

So, summarizing, for each c, possible (b,d):

c | b | d
0 |3 |5
1 |1,8|1
2 |6 |4
3 |4 |0
4 |2,9|3
5 |0,7|6
6 |5 |2
7 |3 |5
8 |1,8|1
9 |6 |4

Now, so

---------------

 for each c, I have possible (b,d) pairs. Now, I can use this information to find possible N=

---------------

abcd.

But wait, I also have equation5: 6(a-1) ≡ (d-1) mod7.

So, 6(a-1) ≡ (d -1) mod7.

I can write this as 6(a -1) - (d -1) ≡0 mod7.

So, 6a -6 -d +1 ≡0 mod7 →6a -d -5 ≡0 mod7.

So, 6a ≡d +5 mod7.

So, 6a ≡(d +5) mod7.

Since

---------------

 6 and7 are coprime, I can multiply both sides by the inverse of6 mod7. The inverse of6 mod7 is 6, because 6*6=36≡1 mod7.

So, a ≡6*(d +5) mod7.

So, a ≡6d +30 mod7.

30 mod7 is 2, because 7*4=28, 30-28=2.

So, a ≡6d +2 mod7.

So, a ≡ (6d +2) mod7.

So, for each possible (c, b, d), I can compute a ≡ (6d +2) mod7.

And since a is a digit from1-9, let's compute possible a's for each d.

Let me make

---------------

 a table for each d (0-9) and a ≡(6d +2) mod7.

d |6d +2 mod7 | a ≡ [

---------------

value] mod7 | possible a
0 |2          | a≡2 mod7 →a=2,9
1 |8≡1        | a≡1 mod7 →a=1,8
2 |14≡0       | a≡0 mod7 →a=7
3 |20≡6       | a≡6 mod7 →a=6,13→6
4 |26≡5       | a≡5 mod7 →a=5,12→5
5 |32≡4       | a≡4 mod7 →a=4,11→4
6 |38≡3       | a≡3 mod7 →a=3,10→3
7 |44≡2       | a≡2 mod7 →a=2,9
8 |50≡1       | a≡1 mod7 →a=1,8
9 |56≡0       | a≡0 mod7 →a=7

So, for each d, possible a's:

d=0: a=2,9

d=1: a=1,8

d=2: a=7

d=3: a=6

d=4: a=5

d=5: a=4

d=6: a=3

d=7: a=2,9

d=8: a=1,8

d=9: a=7

So, now, combining all this information.

Each

---------------

 possible c has its own (b, d), and for each d, possible a's.

Now, since N is a four-digit number, a must be from1-9, and b

---------------

, c, d from0-9.

We need the greatest possible N, so ideally a=9, then 9xxx.

But let's see if a=9 is possible.

Let me check for a=9.

From the a table above, a=9 corresponds to d=0 or7 (since for d=0, a=2 or9; for d=7, a=2 or9).

Wait, no

---------------

, wait. Wait, in the a table, a=9 is possible when d=0 or7.

Wait, from

---------------

 the a table:

d=0: a=2,9.

d=7: a=2,9.

So, if a=9, then d must be 0 or7.

So, let's see.

Case 1: a=9, d=0.

Looking back, from the (c, b, d) table, d=0 occurs when c=3.

So, when c=3, d=0, and b=4.

So, N= a b c d =9 4 3 0.

Wait, let me check if this N satisfies all conditions.

But before that, let me check if a

---------------

=9 is possible with d=7.

Case 2: a=9, d=7.

Looking back, d=7 occurs when c=7.

So, c=7, b=3, d=5? Wait no, wait. Wait, let

---------------

 me check the (c, b, d) table again.

Wait, no, wait: when d=7, but

---------------

 in the (c, b, d) table, I think d is determined by c and b. Wait, no, actually

---------------

, d is determined by c and b. So, if d=7, that would be when d=7, but looking back, in the (c, b, d) table, d=5 occurs when c=0,7; d=1 when c=1,8; etc.

Wait, no, actually

---------------

, in the (c, b, d) table, for each c, we have a specific d.

Wait, maybe

---------------

 I'm getting confused. Let me think.

Wait, for a=9, possible d=0 or7.

But in the (c, b, d) table, for d=0, c

---------------

=3, b=4.

Similarly, for d=7, does any c have d=7? Let me check the (c, b, d) table.

Looking at the (c, b, d) table, d varies as follows:

c=0: d=5

c=1: d=1

c=2: d=4

c=3: d=0

c=4: d=3

c=5: d=6

c=6: d=2

c=7: d=5

c=8: d=1

c=9: d=4

So, d=7 is not present in the (c, b, d) table. So, perhaps

---------------

 d=7 is not a possible digit in N. Because for a=9, d=7 would require that for some c, d=7, but looking at the table, for c=3, d=0, and other

---------------

 c's have other d's.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Wait, when I was computing the (c, b, d) table, for each c, I computed

---------------

 d based on b and c. So, perhaps d=7 is not achievable because in the equations, d is determined by b and c, and for

---------------

 a=9, d must be 0 or7, but d=7 isn't in the (c, b, d) table.

So, for a=9, possible d=0 or7, but only d=0 is present in the (c, b, d) table, when c=3, b=4, d=0.

So, N=9 4 3 0.

Wait, but let me check if this N=9430 satisfies all the conditions.

So, N=9430.

Now, let's check each modified number:

1. Replace a with1: 1430. Is 1430 divisible by7?

Compute 1430 ÷7: 7*204=1428, so 1430-1428=2. So, remainder 2. Not divisible by7. So, this N doesn't satisfy the condition.

Hmm, so maybe a=9 is not possible because when a=9, d=0, but replacing a with1 gives 1430, which is not divisible by7.

So, a=9 is invalid. So, let

---------------

's try the next possible a, which would be a=8.

So, a=8.

From the a table, a=8 corresponds to d=1 or8.

Because for d=1, a=1 or8.

For d=8, a=1 or8.

Wait, from

---------------

 the a table, a=8 is possible when d=1 or8.

So, let's see.

Case 3: a=8, d=1.

Looking back at the (c, b, d) table, d=1 occurs when c=1 or8.

So, for c=1, b=1 or8, d=1.

For c=8, b=1 or8, d=1.

So, possible N's would be 8 b c d.

For c=1, d=1, b=1 or8.

So, N could be 8 1 1 1 or 8 8 1 1.

Similarly, for c=8, d=1, b=1 or8.

So, N could be 8 1 8 1 or 8 8 8 1.

Wait, let's check these possibilities.

First, N=8111.

Check the conditions:

Replace a=8 with1: 1111. 1111 ÷7: 7*158=1106, 1111-1106=5. Not divisible by7. So, invalid.

Next, N=8811.

Replace a=8 with1: 1811. 1811 ÷7: 7*258=1806, 1811-1806=5. Not divisible by7. Invalid.

Next, N=8181.

Replace a=8 with1: 1181. 1181 ÷7: 7*168=1176, 1181-1176=5. Not divisible by7. Invalid.

Next, N=8881.

Replace a=8 with1: 1881. 1881 ÷7: 7*268=1876, 1881-1876=5. Not divisible by7. Invalid.

Hmm, none of these N's with a=8, d=1 satisfy the condition when a is replaced by1. So, perhaps a=8 is not possible with d=1.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check N=8881.

Wait, 1881 ÷7: 7*268=1876. 1876+5=1881. So, remainder 5. Not divisible.

So, perhaps a=8 is not possible with d=1.

Now, let's check a=8 with d=8.

From the a table, a=8 corresponds to d=8.

Looking at the (c, b, d) table, d=8 occurs when c=8, because

---------------

 for c=8, d=1. Wait, no, looking at the table:

Wait, in the (c, b, d) table, for c=8, d=1. So, d=8 is not present in the (c, b, d) table.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the (c, b, d) table again.

Wait, in the (c, b, d) table, d varies as:

c=0: d=5

c=1: d=1

c=2: d=4

c=3: d=0

c=4: d=3

c=5: d=6

c=6: d=2

c=7: d=5

c=8: d=1

c=9: d=4

So, d=8 is not present in the (c, b, d) table. So, for a=8, d must be 1 or8, but d=8 is not present. So, only d=1 is possible, but as we saw, that doesn't work.

So, a=8 is not possible because when d=1, replacing a with1 doesn't give a number divisible by7.

So, let's try a=7.

From the a table, a=7 is possible when d=2 or9.

Because for d=2, a=3 or10→3.

Wait, no, wait: from the a table:

d=2: a=3

d=9: a=7.

Wait, no, looking back at the a table:

d | a possible
0 |2,9
1 |1,8
2 |7
3 |6
4 |5
5 |4
6 |3
7 |2,9
8 |1,8
9 |7

So, for a=7, possible d=2 or9.

So, for d=2, a=7.

For d=9, a=7.

Now, let's check the (c, b, d) table for d=2 and d=9.

d=2 occurs when c=6, b=5.

d=9 occurs when... wait, looking at the (c, b, d) table, d=9 isn't present. So, perhaps d=9 is not achievable.

Wait, no

---------------

, looking back, in the (c, b, d) table, for c=6, d=2.

c=9, d=4.

So, d=9 is not present in the (c, b, d) table. So, for a=7, d=2 is possible, but d=9 is not.

So, let's check d=2.

So, a=7, d=2.

From the (c, b, d) table, d=2 occurs when c=6, b=5.

So, N=7 5 6 2.

Let me check if this N satisfies all the conditions.

N=7562.

Check each modified number:

1. Replace a=7 with1: 1562. Is 1562 divisible by7?

Compute 1562 ÷7: 7*223=1561, 1562-1561=1. Not divisible. So, this N doesn't satisfy the condition.

Hmm, so a=7 is invalid.

Next, a=6.

From the a table, a=6 is possible when d=3.

Because for d=3, a=6.

So, a=6, d=3.

Looking at the (c, b, d) table, d=3 occurs when c=4, b=2 or9.

So, possible N's are 6 2 4 3 and 6 9 4 3.

Check N=6243.

Replace a=6 with1: 1243.

Check 1243 ÷7: 7*177=1239, 1243-1239=4. Not divisible. So, invalid.

Next, N=6943.

Replace a=6 with1: 1943.

Compute 1943 ÷7: 7*277=1939, 1943-1939=4. Not divisible. So, invalid.

So, a=6 is invalid.

Next, a=5.

From the a table, a=5 is possible when d=4.

Because for d=4, a=5.

Looking at the (c, b, d) table, d=4 occurs when c=2 or9.

For c=2: b=6, d=4.

For c=9: b=6, d=4.

So, possible N's are 5 6 2 4 and 5 6 9 4.

Check N=5624.

Replace a=5 with1: 1624.

Check 1624 ÷7: 7*232=1624. Exactly divisible. Good.

Now, check other conditions:

Replace b=6 with1: 5124.

5124 ÷7: 7*732=5124. Exactly divisible. Good.

Replace c=2 with1: 5614.

5614 ÷7: 7*802=5614. Exactly divisible. Good.

Replace d=4 with1: 5621.

5621 ÷7: 7*803=5621. Exactly divisible. Good.

So, N=5624 satisfies all conditions.

But wait, is

---------------

 there a higher N than 5624?

Because we're looking for the greatest four-digit N.

Wait, but let

---------------

's check the other N when c=9: N=5694.

Check N=5694.

Replace a=5 with1: 1694.

1694 ÷7: 7*242=1694. Exactly divisible.

Replace b=6 with1: 5194.

5194 ÷7: 7*742=5194. Exactly divisible.

Replace c=9 with1: 5614.

5614 ÷7: 7*802=5614. Exactly divisible.

Replace d=4 with1: 5691.

5691 ÷7: 7*813=5691. Exactly divisible.

So, N=5694 also satisfies all conditions.

Is 5694 greater than 5624? Yes, so 5694 is a better candidate.

But let's see if there are higher N's with a=5.

Wait, for

---------------

 a=5, d=4, and c=9, b=6.

So, N=5694.

Is there a higher N with a=5?

Wait

---------------

, perhaps if c=9, but higher b's? Wait, no, because for c=9, b is fixed at6.

So, the maximum N for a=5 is 5694.

But let's check higher a's.

Wait, earlier, a=9 didn't work, a=8 didn't work, a=7 didn't work, a=6 didn't work, a=5 worked.

But maybe I missed higher a's.

Wait, perhaps a=9,

---------------

 d=0, but that didn't work because replacing a=9 with1 gave a number not divisible by7.

But maybe there's another a=9 possibility.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I should check if a=9 is possible with d=0, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me re-examine N=9430.

Wait, when I replace a=9 with1, I get 1430.

1430 ÷7: 7*204=1428. 1430-1428=2. So, remainder 2. Not divisible.

So, N=9430 doesn't work.

Is there another N with a=9 that might work?

Wait, let

---------------

 me think.

From the a table, a=9 corresponds to d=0 or7.

But in the (c, b, d) table, d=0 occurs only when c=3, b=4.

So, N=9430.

But

---------------

 that doesn't work. So, perhaps a=9 is impossible.

So, the next possible a is 5, giving N=5694.

Wait, but maybe I can find a higher N with a=5.

Wait, N

---------------

=5694 is 5694. What about N=5994? But wait, from

---------------

 the (c, b, d) table, for a=5, d=4, and c=9, b=6. So, N=5694.

Wait, but perhaps I can have a higher c and

---------------

 b.

Wait, but for a=5, d=4, and c=9, b=6. So, that's the maximum for a=5.

Alternatively, maybe a=5, c=9, b=6, d=4.

Wait, let

---------------

's check if there's a higher N with a=5, but maybe higher b or c.

But from the (c, b, d) table, for c=9, b=6 is fixed.

So, N=5694 is the highest for a=5.

But wait, let's check a=5, c=9, b=6, d=4: N=5694.

Is there a higher N with a=5, but with higher digits in b, c, or d?

Wait, for

---------------

 a=5, d=4, and c=9, b=6.

Is there a way to have b=9 for c=4, but no, because for c=4, b=2 or9, but d=3.

So, N=5 9 4 3.

Wait, let me check if that works.

N=5943.

Check replacing a=5 with1: 1943.

1943 ÷7: 7*277=1939, remainder 4. Not divisible. So, invalid.

So, a=5, b=9, c=4, d=3 doesn't work.

So, N=5694 is valid.

But wait, is there a higher N with a=5?

Wait, let's check N=5994.

But from the (c, b, d) table, for c=9, b=6, d=4.

So, N=5 6 9 4.

Wait, that's 5694, which is less than 5994. So, no.

Alternatively, maybe a=5, c=9, b=6, d=4 is the highest possible for a=5.

So, N=5694.

But wait, perhaps a=5, c=9, b=6, d=4 is the highest possible.

But wait, 5694 is less than 9999, but maybe there's a higher N with a=5.

Wait, perhaps I should check a=5, c=9, b=6, d=4: 5694.

Is there a way to have a higher N with a=5? For example, a=5, c=9, b=6, d=4 is 5694.

Wait, what about a=5, c=9, b=6, d=4: that's 5694.

Wait, but

---------------

 if I can find a higher N with a=5, that's better.

Alternatively, perhaps I can check a=5, c=9, b=6, d=4: 5694.

Wait, but perhaps I can try a=5, c=9, b=6, d=4, which is 5694.

Wait, but maybe I can find a higher N with a=5, c=9, b=6, d=4.

Wait, no, that's the highest possible for a=5.

But wait, let's think again. Maybe a=5, c=9, b=6, d=4 is 5694.

Is there a higher N with a=5?

Wait, perhaps a=5, c=9, b=6, d=4 is the highest possible.

So, N

---------------

=5694.

Wait, but let's see if a=5, c=9, b=6, d=4 is valid.

Yes, as checked earlier, all modified numbers are divisible by7.

So, N=5694.

But wait, let

---------------

's check if there's a higher N with a=5.

Wait, perhaps if I can have a=5, c=9, b=6, d=4, which is 5694.

Alternatively, maybe a=5, c=9, b=6, d=4 is the maximum.

Wait, but let me think about a=5, c=9, b=6, d=4: 5694.

Is there a higher N with a=5?

Wait, perhaps if I can have a higher b, but for c=9, b is fixed at6.

So, no.

Alternatively, maybe a=5, c=9, b=6, d=4 is the highest possible.

But wait, let's check N=5994: but from

---------------

 the (c, b, d) table, for c=9, b=6, d=4.

So, N=5694.

Wait, but perhaps I can try a=5, c=9, b=6, d=4.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for higher a's.

Wait, but

---------------

 a=5 is lower than a=9,8,7,6, which didn't work, so 5694 might be the highest possible N.

Wait, but let me check a=5, c=9, b=6, d=4.

Yes, that's N=5694.

Wait, but let me check if there's a higher N with a=5, but perhaps with c=9, b=6, d=4 is 5694.

Wait, perhaps I should check if a=5, c=9, b=6, d=4 is the maximum possible.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I can try a=5, c=9, b=6, d=4: 5694.

But let's see if there's a higher N with a=5.

Wait, perhaps a=5, c=9, b=6, d=4 is the highest possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can try a=5, c=9, b=6, d=4: 5694.

But let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I can have a=5, c=9, b=6, d=4, which is 5694.

But let me check if N=5694 is the maximum possible.

Wait, but let

---------------

's think differently.

Suppose I consider that N must be the maximum possible four-digit number, so starting from 9999 and going down, checking each number to see if it satisfies the condition.

But that would be time-consuming, but perhaps for the sake of this

---------------

 problem, it's manageable.

Wait, but given the earlier analysis, the highest possible N is 5694.

Wait, but let's check if N=5694 is indeed the maximum.

Wait, another approach: Since a=5 is the highest possible a that works, then N=5xxx.

But wait, in

---------------

 the earlier analysis, a=5 gives N=5694.

But perhaps there's a higher N with a=5, but higher c and b.

Wait, for a=5, d=4, and c=9, b=6, which gives N=5694.

But let me check N=5994.

Wait, for N=5994, let's check if it satisfies the conditions.

So, N=5994.

Check replacing each digit with1:

1. Replace a=5 with1: 1994.

1994 ÷7: 7*285=1995, which is 1 more than 1994. So, remainder= -1, which is 6 mod7. Not divisible.

So, N=5994 doesn't satisfy the condition.

Similarly, N=5984: but I

---------------

 don't know if that's valid.

Alternatively, perhaps N=5694 is the highest possible.

Wait, but let me check N=5694.

Yes, as checked earlier, all modified numbers are divisible by7.

So, N=5694.

Wait, but let me check if there's a higher N with a=5.

Wait, N=5994: doesn't work.

N=5984: let's see.

But from the (c, b, d) table, for a=5, d=4, and c=9, b=6.

So, N=5694.

Is there a way to get a higher N with a=5?

Wait, perhaps a=5, c=9, b=6, d=4 is the maximum.

So, N=5694.

Wait, but let me check N=5694.

Yes, as earlier, it works.

So, perhaps N=5694 is the answer.

But wait, let me check if a=5 is the highest possible.

Wait, earlier, a=9,8,7,6 didn't work, so a=5 is the highest possible a that works.

So, N=5694.

Now, the problem asks for Q + R, where Q is the quotient when N is divided by1000, and R is the remainder.

So, N=5694.

Divide by1000: 5694 ÷1000=5 with remainder 694.

So, Q=5, R=694.

So, Q+R=5+694=699.

Wait, but wait, 5 + 694 is 699.

But wait, let me confirm N=5694.

Yes, N

---------------

=5694.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier because 5694 is a four-digit number, but when I checked

---------------

 a=5, c=9, b=6, d=4, I got N=5694.

Wait, but in the (c, b, d) table, for c=9, b=6, d=4.

So, N=5 6 9 4 →5694.

Yes.

So, Q=5, R=694, sum is 5+694=699.

But wait, let me check if I can find a higher N with a=5.

Wait, perhaps N=5994 doesn't work, but what about N=5984?

But I don't know if that satisfies the conditions.

Wait, let's try N=5984.

Check replacing a=5 with1: 1984.

1984 ÷7: 7*283=1981, 1984-1981=3. Not divisible.

So, invalid.

Similarly, N=5974.

Replace a=5 with1:1974.

1974 ÷7: 7*282=1974. Exactly divisible.

Now, check other conditions.

Replace b=9 with1:5174.

5174 ÷7: 7*739=5173, remainder1. Not divisible.

So, invalid.

Hmm, so N=5974 doesn't work.

Alternatively, N=5964.

Replace a=5 with1:1964.

1964 ÷7: 7*280=1960, 1964-1960=4. Not divisible.

So, invalid.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps N=5694 is indeed the highest possible.

So, I think N=5694 is the answer.

Thus, Q=5, R=694, so Q+R=5+694=699.

Wait, but let me check if there's a higher N with a=5.

Wait, another approach: Let

---------------

's consider that for a=5, c=9, b=6, d=4, which gives N=5694.

But wait, perhaps

---------------

 I can have a higher c or b.

Wait, for a=5, d=4, c=9, b=6.

So, N=5694.

Wait, but perhaps I can have a higher c, but from the (c, b, d) table, c=9 is the highest.

So, N=5694.

Yes, that seems to be the highest possible N that satisfies all conditions.

So, the answer is Q+R=5+694=699.


To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number \( N \) such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We then find \( Q + R \) where \( Q \) is the quotient and \( R \) is the remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - \( N \) is a four-digit number \( abcd \).
   - Changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7.
   - We need to find the largest such \( N \).

2. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - \( N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \).
   - When any digit is changed to 1, the resulting number must be divisible by 7.

3. **Modular Conditions:**
   - Derived

---------------

 four conditions based on replacing each digit with 1 and ensuring divisibility by 7.

4. **Solving for Digits:**
   - Through modular arithmetic and substitution, we determine possible values for \( a, b, c, d \) that satisfy all conditions.

5. **Finding the Maximum \( N \):**
   - After analyzing possible values, the highest valid \( N \) found is 5694.

6. **Calculating \( Q \) and \( R \):**
   - \( N = 5694 \).
   - \( Q = 5 \) (quotient when divided by 1000).
   - \( R = 694 \) (remainder).
   - \( Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699 \).
