Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product ∏_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, ω is a 13th root of unity and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, 

---------------

13th roots of unity... I remember that these are complex numbers that satisfy ω^13 = 1. So, ω can be written as e^(2πi/13), right?

Let me first write down what the product looks like. For each k from 0 to 12, I have a term (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). I need to compute the product of all these terms and then find the remainder when it's divided by 1000.

Wait, but k

---------------

 runs from 0 to 12, which is all the 13th roots of unity. So, ω^k for k=0 to 12 gives all the distinct 13th roots. That

---------------

 might be useful.

Let me consider each term in the product: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this or find a pattern. Let me try to rewrite

---------------

 it:

2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2.

Hmm, that's a quadratic in terms of ω^k. Let me think if that can be factored or expressed differently. Maybe factor

---------------

 it as a quadratic equation: x^2 - 2x + 2, where x = ω^k. So each term is x^2 - 2x + 2.

Wait, so

---------------

 the product becomes ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x^2 - 2x + 2) evaluated at x = ω^k. Since each ω^k is a root of x^13 - 1 = 0, except ω^0 = 1.

But how do I handle the product of such

---------------

 terms over all roots? Maybe I can relate this to polynomials. I remember that for a polynomial P(x), the product over (x - a_i) is P(x), where a_i are the roots. But here, it's not exactly a product of (x - a_i), but a product of quadratic terms evaluated at each root.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the product as the product over all roots of a certain polynomial. Let me define a polynomial Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. Then, the product I'm trying to compute is the product of Q(ω^k) for k=0 to 12.

Since ω^k are the 13th roots of unity, except

---------------

 ω^0=1 is included. So, is there a way to express the product of Q(ω^k) for all k?

I remember that for a polynomial f(x), the product over (f(ω^k)) for k=0 to n-1 is equal to the resultant of f(x) and x^n - 1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe using cyclotomic polynomials.

Wait, another approach: since

---------------

 ω^k are the roots of x^13 - 1 = 0, except x=1. So, the minimal polynomial is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that for each root ω^k, Q(ω^k) = 0 would be a

---------------

 quadratic equation. But perhaps that's not the way to go.

Wait, another thought: since the product is over all ω^k, which are all roots of x^13 - 1, maybe I can relate this product to evaluating some polynomial at x=1 or something like that.

Let me think about the product over all k of (x^2 - 2x + 2) evaluated at x = ω^k.

Wait, so

---------------

 if I consider the product over all roots ω^k of (Q(ω^k)) where Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2, then this product is equal to the resultant of Q(x) and x^13 - 1. Alternatively, it's the product of Q(x) evaluated at each root of x^13 - 1.

I think another way to compute the product is to note that for any polynomial f(x), the product of f(ω^k) over all k is equal to the resultant of f(x) and x^13 - 1. But I'm not exactly sure how to compute that.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the product over all ω^k of (a - ω^k) is equal to a^13 - 1. Because the

---------------

 product of (a - ω^k) for k=0 to 12 is equal to a^13 - 1, since each ω^k is a root of x^13 - 1.

But in my case, each term is Q(ω^k) = (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). So, perhaps

---------------

 I can express Q(ω^k) in terms of (something - ω^k). Hmm, not directly.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of Q(x) as (x - α)(x - β), where α and β are the roots of Q(x). Then, the product over all k of Q(ω^k) is equal to the product over all k of (ω^k - α)(ω^k - β). That would be equal to the product of (ω^k - α) times the product of (ω^k - β).

But the product of (ω^k - α) for all k is equal to α^13 - 1, because each

---------------

 ω^k is a root of x^13 - 1, so (x - ω^k) product

---------------

 is x^13 - 1, so substituting x = α gives product (α - ω^k) = α^13 - 1. Similarly for β.

Therefore, product_{k=0}^{12} Q(ω^k) = product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - α)(ω^k - β) = (α^13 - 1)(β^13 - 1).

So, I

---------------

 need to find α and β first. Since Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2, the roots are α and β. Let's compute them.

Using quadratic formula: α, β = [2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 ± 2i] / 2 = 1 ± i.

So, α = 1 + i, β = 1 - i.

Therefore, product_{k=0}^{12} Q(ω^k) = (α^13 - 1)(β^13 - 1) = [(1 + i)^13 - 1][(1 - i)^13 - 1].

Now, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.

First, let's compute (1 + i)^13. I know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is π/4 radians.

So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{iπ/4}.

Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * π/4}.

Similarly, (1 - i) is sqrt(2) * e^{-iπ/4}, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13π/4}.

Compute (sqrt(2))^13:

sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).

Now, the exponentials:

For (1 + i)^13: e^{i * 13π/4}.

13π/4 is equal to 3π + π/4, which is equivalent to π/4 (

---------------

since angles are modulo 2π). Wait, 13π/4 divided by 2π is 13/8, which is 1 and 5/8, so subtracting 2π (which is 8π/4) gives 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4.

Wait, no, 13π/4 is 3π + π/4. Since 3π is π + 2π, which is the same as π when considering modulo 2π. So, 13π/4 - 3*2π = 13π/4 - 12π/4 = π/4. Wait, no, that can't be right because 13π/4 is more than 3π.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 13π/4 modulo 2π. 2π is 8π/4. So 13π/4 divided by 8π/4 is 13/8, which is 1 with a remainder of 5/8. So, 5/8 * 2π = 5π/4.

Wait, no

---------------

, perhaps I should subtract 2π (which is 8π/4) from 13π/4 to get 5π/4. So, e^{i * 13π/4} = e^{i * (5π/4)} = cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2).

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = sqrt(2)^13 * e^{-i *13π/4} = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{-i * 5π/4}.

e^{-i *5π/4} = cos(5π/4) - i sin(5π/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2).

So, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = let's compute that.

First, multiply 64*sqrt(2) by (-sqrt(2)/2):

64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.

Similarly, the imaginary part: 64*sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-i * 2 / 2) = 64*(-i) = -64i.

So, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2).

Compute real part: 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-2/2) = -64.

Imaginary part: 64*sqrt(2)*(i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(i * 2 / 2) = 64i.

So, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.

Now, going

---------------

 back to the product:

[(1 + i)^13 - 1][(1 - i)^13 - 1] = [(-64 - 64i) - 1] * [(-64 + 64i) - 1] = (-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i).

This is a product of the form (a - b)(a + b) where a = -65 and b = 64i. So, it's a^2 - b^2.

Compute a^2: (-65)^2 = 4225.

Compute b^2: (64i)^2 = 64^2 * i^2 = 4096*(-1) = -4096.

So, a^2 - b^2 = 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 + 4096 = let's compute that.

4225 + 4096:

4000 + 4000 = 8000.

225 + 96 = 321.

So total is 8000 + 321 = 8321.

Wait, no, wait. 4225 + 4096:

4000 + 4000 is 8000.

225 + 96 is 321.

But 4225 is 4000 + 225, and 4096 is 4000 + 96.

Wait, actually

---------------

, 4225 + 4096:

4225 + 4096 = (4000 + 225) + (4000 + 96) = 8000 + (225 + 96) = 8000 + 321 = 8321.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the product is 8321.

Wait, but the

---------------

 problem says to find the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.

Wait, but

---------------

 let me double-check the calculations because that seems straightforward, but I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Let me recap:

1. The

---------------

 product is ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) = ∏_{k=0}^{12} Q(ω^k), where Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2.

2. Since Q(x) factors as (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)), the product becomes ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1+i)) (ω^k - (1-i)).

3. This is equal to [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1+i))] * [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1-i))].

4. Each product is equal to (1+i)^13 - 1 and (1-i)^13 - 1, respectively.

5. Calculated (1+i)^13 = -64 -64i, so (1+i)^13 -1 = -65 -64i.

6. Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = -64 +64i, so (1 -i)^13 -1 = -65 +64i.

7. Multiply these two: (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 +4096 = 8321.

8. 8321 divided by 1000 leaves a remainder of 321.

So, the remainder is 321.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me check if I made

---------------

 any mistake in the exponents or the calculations.

Wait, let me recalculate (1 + i)^13.

(1 + i) is sqrt(2) e^{iπ/4}, so (1 + i)^13 is (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i 13π/4}.

(sqrt(2))^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2). Correct.

13π/4: Let's compute 13 divided by 8 (since 2π is 8π/4). 13 -

---------------

 8 = 5, so 5π/4 is the equivalent angle.

e^{i5π/4} = cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2, -sqrt(2)/2). So, yes, (-

---------------

sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2).

Multiply by 64 sqrt(2):

64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2/2) = -64.

Similarly, the imaginary part: 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 i) = 64*(-2/2)i = -64i. So, correct.

So, (1 + i)^13 is -64 -64i, and

---------------

 subtracting 1 gives -65 -64i.

Similarly for (1 -i)^13: same modulus, angle -5π/4.

e^{-i5π/4} = cos(5π/4) - i sin(5π/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2, +sqrt(2)/2).

Multiply by 64 sqrt(2):

Real part: 64 sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = -64.

Imaginary part: 64 sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)/2 i) = 64i.

So, (1 - i)^13 is -64 +64i. Subtract 1: -65 +64i.

Multiply them: (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2.

(-65)^2 = 4225.

(64i)^2 = 64^2 * i^2 = 4096 * (-1) = -4096.

So, 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 +4096 = 8321. Correct.

So, 8321 mod 1000 is 8321 - 8*1000 = 8321 - 8000 = 321.

Therefore, the remainder is 321.


To solve the problem, we recognize that each term in the product is a quadratic evaluated at the 13th roots of unity. By factoring the quadratic and using properties of roots of unity, we find the product simplifies to a comput

---------------

able expression. Evaluating this expression modulo 1000 gives the remainder.

The remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is:
