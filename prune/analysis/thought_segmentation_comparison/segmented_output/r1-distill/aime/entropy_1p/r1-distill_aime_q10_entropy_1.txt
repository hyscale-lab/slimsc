Okay, so I've got this complex number problem to solve. The question is asking for the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I remember that when dealing with complex numbers, especially with modulus constraints, it's often helpful to express \( z \) in polar form. Since \( |z| = 4 \), I can write \( z \) as \( 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). That makes sense because the modulus is 4, so the magnitude is fixed, and \( \theta \) can vary to represent any point on the circle with radius 4 in the complex plane.

So, substituting \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) into the expression, let's see what happens. The first part of the expression is \( (75 + 117i)z \), which would become \( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} \). The second part is \( \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \), which would be \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} \). Simplifying both parts:

First term: \( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} \)
Second term: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = \frac{1}{4}(96 + 144i)e^{-i\theta} \) because \( 1/z = e^{-i\theta} \) when \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \).

So the entire expression becomes:
\[ 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{1}{4}(96 + 144i)e^{-i\theta} \]

Now, I need to compute the real part of this expression. To do that, I can express each term in terms of cosine and sine using Euler's formula. Remember that \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

Let me denote \( A = 75 + 117i \) and \( B = 96 + 144i \) for simplicity. So, the expression becomes:
\[ 4A e^{i\theta} + \frac{B}{4} e^{-i\theta} \]

Expanding each term using Euler's formula:
- \( 4A e^{i\theta} = 4A (\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) = 4A \cos\theta + 4iA \sin\theta \)
- \( \frac{B}{4} e^{-i\theta} = \frac{B}{4} (\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) = \frac{B}{4} \cos\theta - \frac{iB}{4} \sin\theta \)

Adding these together:
\[ (4A \cos\theta + \frac{B}{4} \cos\theta) + i(4A \sin\theta - \frac{B}{4} \sin\theta) \]

Since we are interested in the real part, we can ignore the imaginary components. So, the real part \( Re \) is:
\[ Re = (4A + \frac{B}{4}) \cos\theta \]

Wait, hold on, let me verify that. Because

---------------

 when you add \( 4A \cos\theta \) and \( \frac{B}{4} \cos\theta \), it's \( (4A + \frac{B}{4}) \cos\theta \). Similarly

---------------

, the imaginary part would involve \( (4A - \frac{B}{4}) \sin\theta \), but we don't need that here.

So, substituting back \( A = 75 + 117i \) and \( B = 96 + 144i \), let's compute \( 4A + \frac{B}{4} \).

First, compute \( 4A \):
\( 4A = 4*(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i \)

Then, compute \( \frac{B}{4} \):
\( \frac{B}{4} = \frac{96 + 144i}{4} = 24 + 36i \)

Adding them together:
\( 300 + 24 = 324 \)
\( 468i + 36i = 504i \)
So, \( 4A + \frac{B}{4} = 324 + 504i \)

Therefore, the real part of the entire expression is:
\[ Re = (324 + 504i) \cos\theta \]

Wait, but \( Re \) is a real number, right? So, if

---------------

 \( (324 + 504i) \) is a complex number, multiplying by \( \cos\theta \) would give another complex number. But I

---------------

 thought we were only taking the real part. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my earlier reasoning.

Let me think again. Let

---------------

's correctly compute the real part of the entire expression.

So, the expression is:
\[ (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \]
With \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), so \( 1/z = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \).

Sub

---------------

stituting:
\[ (75 + 117i)4e^{i\theta} + (96 + 144i)\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \]
Which simplifies to:
\[ 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{1}{4}(96 + 144i)e^{-i\theta} \]

Now, expand each term:
First term:
\( 4(75 + 117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \)
= \( 4*75 \cos\theta + 4*75 i \sin\theta + 4*117i \cos\theta + 4*117i^2 \sin\theta \)
But \( i^2 = -1 \), so:
= \( 300 \cos\theta + 300 i \sin\theta + 468 i \cos\theta - 468 \sin\theta \)

Second term:
\( \frac{1}{4}(96 + 144i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \)
= \( \frac{96}{4} \cos\theta - \frac{96}{4} i \sin\theta + \frac{144i}{4} \cos\theta - \frac{144i^2}{4} \sin\theta \)
Simplify:
= \( 24 \cos\theta - 24 i \sin\theta + 36 i \cos\theta + 36 \sin\theta \) (since \( i^2 = -1 \))

Now, let's combine both terms.

First, collect the real parts:
From first term: \( 300 \cos\theta - 468 \sin\theta \)
From second term: \( 24 \cos\theta + 36 \sin\theta \)
Total real part: \( (300 + 24) \cos\theta + (-468 + 36) \sin\theta = 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta \)

Imaginary parts (though we don't need them, but just for checking):
From first term: \( 300 i \sin\theta + 468 i \cos\theta \)
From second term: \( -24 i \sin\theta + 36 i \cos\theta \)
Total imaginary part: \( (300 \sin\theta -24 \sin\theta) i + (468 \cos\theta + 36 \cos\theta) i = (276 \sin\theta + 504 \cos\theta) i \)

So, the real part is \( 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta \). Now

---------------

, our goal is to find the maximum value of this real part as \( \theta \) varies.

So, we can think of the real part as a function \( f(\theta) = 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta \). We need to find the maximum value of \( f(\theta) \).

I remember that an expression of the form \( a \cos\theta + b \sin\theta \) can be rewritten as \( R \cos(\theta + \phi) \) where \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \) and \( \phi \) is some phase shift. The maximum value of such an expression is \( R \), since the cosine function has a maximum of 1.

Wait, but in our case, it's \( 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta \). So, \(

---------------

 a = 324 \), \( b = -432 \). So, \( R = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \).

Calculating \( R \):
\( 324^2 = (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 +24^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 105, 90000 + 14400 is 104400, plus 576 is 104,976 \)
Wait, actually

---------------

, 324^2: Let me compute 324*324. 300*300=90,000, 300*24=7,200, 24*300=7,200, 24*24=576. So, (300+24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 +24^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2: Let's compute 400^2 = 160,000, 32^2=1,024, and 2*400*32=25,600. So, (400+32)^2=400^2 + 2*400*32 +32^2=160,000 +25,600 +1,024= 186,624.

But since b is -432, b

---------------

^2 is same as 432^2, so 186,624.

So, R = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600). Hmm, what's sqrt(291,600)?

Well, 540^2 is 291,600 because 500^2=250,000, 40^2=1,600, and cross terms 2*500*40=40,000. So, 500+40 squared is 250,000 +40,000 +1,600 = 291,600. So sqrt(291,600) is 540.

So, R = 540. Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(\theta) \) is 540.

Wait, but let me make sure. The expression is \( 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta \), which can be written as \( R \cos(\theta + \phi) \), with R=540, so the maximum value is indeed 540.

So, the largest possible real part is 540. Therefore, the answer should be \boxed{540}.

But wait a second, let me just double

---------------

-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Expressed \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), correct.
2. Substituted into the expression, expanded

---------------

 both terms, correct.
3. Collected real parts correctly: 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, yes.
4. Recognized it as a linear combination of cosθ and sinθ, correct

---------------

.
5. Calculated R as sqrt(324² + 432²) = 540, yes.
6. So maximum real part is 540.

Wait

---------------

, but another way to think about this is by using vectors. The real part can be considered as the dot product of the vector (324, -432) with the vector (cosθ, sinθ). The maximum value of this dot product is the magnitude of the vector (324, -432), which is exactly R = 540. So that's

---------------

 another way to see it.

Alternatively, using calculus, take the derivative of f(θ) and set it to zero to find the maximum. Let me try that quickly

---------------

.

f(θ) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ
df/dθ = -324 sinθ -432 cosθ

Set to zero:
-324 sinθ -432 cosθ = 0
Divide both sides by -36:
9 sinθ + 12 cosθ = 0
Divide both sides by 3:
3 sinθ + 4 cosθ = 0
So, 3 sinθ = -4 cosθ
tanθ = -4/3

So θ = arctan(-4/3). So

---------------

, θ is in the fourth or second quadrant. But regardless, when we plug this back into f(θ), we should get the maximum value.

Alternatively, knowing

---------------

 that the maximum is R, which we've already calculated as 540, so that's consistent.

So, I think I can be confident that the maximum real part is 540.


The problem involves finding the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \).

1. Express \( z \) in polar form: \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \).
2. Substitute \( z \) into the expression:
   \[
   (75 + 117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\theta}
   \]
3. Expand each term using Euler's formula and collect the real parts:
   \[
   \text{Real part} = 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta
   \]
4. Recognize the expression as a linear combination of cosine and sine, which can be rewritten in the form \( R \cos(\theta + \phi) \), where \( R = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = 540 \).
5. The maximum value of this expression is the magnitude \( R \), which is 540.
