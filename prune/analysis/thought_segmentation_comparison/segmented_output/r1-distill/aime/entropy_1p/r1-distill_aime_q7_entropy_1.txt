Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.

First, let's understand the problem. We're dealing with three variables, a, b, and c, which are all nonnegative integers. Their sum is 300, which is a pretty large number, so we

---------------

're looking for triples that add up to 300. The second condition is a bit trickier—it's a symmetric expression involving squares and products. Let me write that down:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, I notice that each term is a product of two variables, with one of them squared. So

---------------

, for example, a²b is a squared times b, a²c is a squared times c, and so on. Also, since all the variables are nonnegative integers, all the terms in this expression are nonnegative as well.

I think symmetry might play a role here. Since the equation is symmetric in a, b, and c, maybe the solutions have some symmetric properties. Perhaps

---------------

 a, b, and c are all equal? Let me check that.

If a = b = c, then since a + b + c = 300, each of them would be 100. Let's plug that into the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b
= 3*(a²b) since all are equal
= 3*(100² * 100)
= 3*(1,000,000)
= 3,000,000.

Wait, but that's only 3,000,000, which is less than 6,000,000. So that can't be the case. Hmm. Maybe two of them are equal, and the third is different. Let me suppose that a = b ≠ c. Let's let a = b = x, and c = 300 - 2x.

Then, substituting into the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b
= x²x + x²(300 - 2x) + x²x + x²(300 - 2x) + (300 - 2x)²x + (300 - 2x)²x.

Wait, let me compute each term step by step.

First term: a²b = x² * x = x³.

Second term: a²c = x² * (300 - 2x).

Third term: b²a = x² * x = x³.

Fourth term: b²c = x² * (300 - 2x).

Fifth term: c²a = (300 - 2x)² * x.

Sixth term: c²b = (300 - 2x)² * x.

So adding all these together:

= x³ + x²(300 - 2x) + x³ + x²(300 - 2x) + x*(300 - 2x)² + x*(300 - 2x)².

Simplify term by term.

First, x³ + x³ = 2x³.

Then, the two x²(300 - 2x) terms: 2 * x²(300 - 2x) = 2x²(300 - 2x).

Then, the two x*(300 - 2x)² terms: 2x*(300 - 2x)².

So, putting it all together:

2x³ + 2x²(300 - 2x) + 2x*(300 - 2x)² = 6,000,000.

Let me factor out the 2:

2[ x³ + x²(300 - 2x) + x*(300 - 2x)² ] = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 2:

x³ + x²(300 - 2x) + x*(300 - 2x)² = 3,000,000.

Let me expand each term.

First term: x³.

Second term: x²(300 - 2x) = 300x² - 2x³.

Third term: x*(300 - 2x)². Let's compute (300 - 2x)² first:

(300 - 2x)² = 300² - 2*300*2x + (2x)² = 90,000 - 1,200x + 4x².

Multiply by x: x*(90,000 - 1,200x + 4x²) = 90,000x - 1,200x² + 4x³.

Now, adding

---------------

 all three terms together:

x³ + (300x² - 2x³) + (90,000x - 1,200x² + 4x³).

Combine like terms:

x³ - 2x³ + 4x³ = 3x³.

300x² - 1,200x² = -900x².

And the linear term is 90,000x.

So overall:

3x³ - 900x² + 90,000x = 3,000,000.

Let me write that as:

3x³ - 900x² + 90,000x - 3,000,000 = 0.

Divide both sides by 3 to simplify:

x³ - 300x² + 30,000x - 1,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, now I have a cubic equation in x. Let me see if I can factor this or find integer roots.

I

---------------

 can try rational root theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of 1,000,000 over factors of 1, so integer divisors of 1,000,000. But that's a lot. Maybe I can test some plausible values.

Given that x is part of a + b + c = 300, and a = b = x, so c = 300 - 2x. Since c must be nonnegative, 300 - 2x ≥ 0 => x ≤ 150.

So x is between 0 and 150.

Let me try x=100:

100³ - 300*(100)^2 +30,000*100 -1,000,000
= 1,000,000 - 300*10,000 + 3,000,000 -1,000,000
= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 +3,000,000 -1,000,000
= 0. Oh, so x=100 is a root.

So, (x - 100) is a factor.

Let me perform polynomial division or factor it out.

Divide x³ - 300x² +30,000x -1,000,000 by (x - 100).

Using synthetic division:

100 | 1   -300    30,000    -1,000,000
           100     -20,000      1,000,000
       -------------------------------
           1    -200     10,000         0

So, the cubic factors as (x - 100)(x² - 200x + 10,000).

Now, set the quadratic equal to zero:

x² - 200x +10,000 =0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [200 ± sqrt(200² - 4*1*10,000)] / 2
= [200 ± sqrt(40,000 -40,000)] /2
= [200 ± 0]/2
= 100.

So, the cubic factors as (x - 100)^2 (x - 100) = (x - 100)^3 = 0.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the quadratic is

---------------

 x² -200x +10,000, which factors as (x -100)^2.

So, the cubic is (x -100)^3.

So, the equation is (x -100)^3 =0, which has a triple root at x=100.

So, the only solution in this case is x=100.

But wait, if

---------------

 x=100, then c=300 -2x=300-200=100. So a=b=c=100, which is the case we first

---------------

 considered. But earlier, when we plugged in a=b=c=100, we got 3,000,000, which is only half of 6,000,000. So, this seems contradictory.

Wait, no

---------------

. Wait, in this case, we're assuming a = b, which gives x=100, but that leads to c=100, which is the same as a=b=c=100. So, perhaps

---------------

 this is the only solution in the case where a = b, but when we plug in, it doesn't satisfy the second equation. Hmm, but wait

---------------

, wait, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution. Let me recheck.

Wait, when I set a = b = x, c = 300 - 2x, and plug into the second equation, I get

---------------

:

2x³ + 2x²(300 - 2x) + 2x(300 - 2x)^2 =6,000,000.

Wait, no, wait

---------------

: earlier, when I set a = b = x, c=300 -2x, then the expression becomes:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b

= x²x + x²(300-2x) + x²x + x²(300-2x) + (300-2x)^2x + (300-2x)^2x.

So, 2x³ + 2x²(300 -2x) + 2x*(300 -2x)^2.

Which is 2x³ + 2*(300x² -2x³) + 2x*(90,000 -1,200x +4x²).

Wait, that

---------------

 would be:

2x³ + 600x² -4x³ + 2x*(90,000 -1,200x +4x²).

S

---------------

implify:

(2x³ -4x³) = -2x³.

+600x².

Then, the last term:

2x*90,000 = 180,000x.

2x*(-1,200x) = -2,400x².

2x*(4x²) =8x³.

So, altogether:

-2x³ +600x² +180,000x -2,400x² +8x³.

Combine like terms:

(-2x³ +8x³) =6x³.

(600x² -2,400x²) = -1,800x².

+180,000x.

So, the entire expression is:

6x³ -1,800x² +180,000x =6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 6:

x³ -300x² +30,000x =1,000,000.

Bring 1,000,000 to left:

x³ -300x² +30,000x -1,000,000 =0.

Wait, earlier, I had the

---------------

 same equation as before. So, when x=100, the equation is satisfied, but when I plug into the original expression, I get 3,000,000, not 6,000,000. So, why

---------------

 is that?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me compute the expression again when a = b = c =100.

Compute a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Each term is 100²*100 =1,000,000. There are six terms: 6*1,000,000=6,000,000.

Wait, wait, that

---------------

's right! So earlier, I thought that when a = b = c =100, the expression gives 3,000,000, but actually, it's 6,000,000. So, that case

---------------

 is valid.

So, when a = b = c =100, the conditions are satisfied. So, that's one solution. But when

---------------

 I assumed a = b, I ended up with x=100, which is the case where all are equal. So, in the case where a = b, the only solution is a = b = c =100.

But that

---------------

's just one triple. Are there other triples where two variables are equal, and the third is different? Or perhaps all variables are distinct?

Wait, but in

---------------

 the case where two variables are equal, we found that the only solution is when all three are equal. So, perhaps the only solution is a = b = c =100. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, no

---------------

. Let me consider another case where, say, a = c ≠ b. Maybe I can get another solution. Or perhaps the

---------------

 only possible solution is when all variables are equal.

Wait, but let's try another approach. Maybe I can express the second equation in terms of a + b + c and ab + bc + ca.

Wait, let's see. The second equation is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Let me factor this expression.

I can factor it as a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

Since a + b + c = 300, then b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c.

So, substituting:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c).

So, the second equation becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) =6,000,000.

Hmm, that's a bit more manageable. Let me write it as:

300a² -a³ +300b² -b³ +300c² -c³ =6,000,000.

Which can be rewritten as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) =6,000,000.

Hmm. Let me see if I can express this in terms of symmetric sums. I know that a + b + c =300, so let me denote S1 = a + b + c =300.

We also have S2 = ab + bc + ca, and S3 = abc.

But I'm not sure how to relate the given equation to these. Let's see.

Wait, a

---------------

² + b² + c² can be expressed as S1² - 2S2. So, a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 300² - 2S2 =90,000 - 2S2.

Similarly, a³ + b³ + c³ can be expressed as (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. So, that's S1³ - 3S1 S2 + 3S3.

So, plugging into the equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) =6,000,000.

Substitute a² + b² + c² =90,000 - 2S2, and a³ + b³ + c³ =300³ -3*300*S2 +3S3.

So:

300*(90,000 - 2S2) - [300³ -3*300*S2 +3S3] =6,000,000.

Compute each term:

300*(90,000) =27,000,000.

300*(-2S2) =-600 S2.

Then, subtract [300³ -3*300 S2 +3S3].

Compute 300³ =27,000,000.

3*300 S2 =900 S2.

So, putting it all together:

27,000,000 -600 S2 -27,000,000 +900 S2 -3S3 =6,000,000.

Simplify:

(27,000,000 -27,000,000) + (-600 S2 +900 S2) -3S3 =6,000,000.

So:

0 + 300 S2 -3S3 =6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100 S2 - S3 =2,000,000.

So, we have:

S3 =100 S2 -2,000,000.

Hmm, that's an equation relating S3 and S2.

Now, let

---------------

's think about the possible values. Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, S2 and S3 are also nonnegative.

But

---------------

 I'm not sure if this helps directly. Maybe I can find another equation involving S2 and S3.

Wait, but

---------------

 maybe it's better to consider the cases where two variables are equal or all are equal.

We saw that when a = b = c =100, the conditions are satisfied. So, that's one solution.

Are there other solutions where two variables are equal but the third is different?

Earlier, when I tried assuming a = b, I ended up with x=100, which led

---------------

 to a = b = c =100, which is the same as all three equal. So, perhaps there are no solutions where exactly two variables are equal.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in that assumption. Let me check again.

Wait, when I assumed a = b, I found that the only solution was x=100, which makes

---------------

 c=100 as well. So, that suggests that if two variables are equal, the third must also be equal. So, perhaps the only solution is when all three variables are equal.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose that two variables are equal, say a = b, and c is different. Then, from

---------------

 a + b + c =300, we have 2a + c=300, so c=300-2a.

Then, substit

---------------

uting into the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Since a = b, this becomes:

a²a + a²c + a²a + a²c + c²a + c²a.

Simplify:

2a³ + 2a²c + 2a c².

Factor:

2a³ + 2a²c + 2a c² = 2a(a² + a c + c²).

Set equal to 6,000,000:

2a(a² + a c + c²) =6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 2:

a(a² + a c + c²) =3,000,000.

But since c=300-2a, substitute:

a(a² + a(300-2a) + (300-2a)^2) =3,000,000.

Let me compute the terms inside the parentheses:

a² + a(300-2a) + (300-2a)^2.

Compute each part:

a².

a(300 -2a) =300a -2a².

(300 -2a)^2 =90,000 -1,200a +4a².

Add them all together:

a² + (300a -2a²) + (90,000 -1,200a +4a²).

Combine like terms:

a² -2a² +4a² =3a².

300a -1,200a =-900a.

+90,000.

So, the expression becomes:

3a² -900a +90,000.

Multiply by a:

a*(3a² -900a +90,000) =3,000,000.

Which is:

3a³ -900a² +90,000a =3,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

a³ -300a² +30,000a =1,000,000.

Which brings us back to the same cubic equation as before, which only has a=100 as a real root. So, when

---------------

 a=100, c=300-200=100. So, again, a=b=c=100.

So, that suggests that if two variables are equal, the third must also be equal. So, the only solution in that case is a=b=c=100.

Hmm. So, perhaps the only solution is when all three variables are equal. But let's check if there are any other solutions where all three variables are distinct.

Wait, but that

---------------

's going to be more complicated. Maybe I can consider the function f(a, b, c) = a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b, given a + b + c=300, and see if it's possible to have other triples (a, b, c) where a, b, c are distinct and satisfy f(a, b, c)=6,000,000.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider

---------------

 the case where one of the variables is zero. Let's say c=0. Then a + b =300, and the second equation becomes:

a²b + a²*0 + b²a + b²*0 +0²a +0²b = a²b + b²a = ab(a + b).

Since a + b=300, this becomes ab*300 =300ab.

Set equal to 6,000,000:

300ab =6,000,000 => ab=20,000.

So, we need to find the number of nonnegative integer solutions to a + b =300 and ab=20,000.

So, a

---------------

 and b are roots of the quadratic equation x² -300x +20,000=0.

Compute discriminant:

300² -4*1*20,000=90,000 -80,000=10,000.

Square root of 10,000 is 100. So, solutions:

x=(300 ±100)/2.

So, x=(400)/2=200, or x=200/2=100.

So, a=200, b=100; or a=100, b=200.

But since c=0, the triples would be (200,100,0), (100,200,0), (200,0,100), (100,0,200), (0,200,100), (0,100,200). Wait, but wait, in this case, c=0, so the possible permutations are when

---------------

 c is zero, and a and b are 200 and 100 in some order.

So, the possible triples are (200,100,0), (100,200,0), (200,0,100), (0,200,100), (100,0,200), (0,100,200). That's six triples where c=0, and a and b are 200 and 100.

But wait, earlier

---------------

 when a=100, b=100, c=100, that's a valid solution as well. So, so far, we have 6 +1=7 solutions. Wait, no, actually, when c=0, and a=200, b=100, that's one solution, and its

---------------

 permutations. So, for each permutation, that's 3 variables, so 3 permutations where one is zero, and the other two are 200 and 100. So, 3*

---------------

2=6 solutions.

Wait, but let me think: if c=0, then the triples are (200,100,0), (100,200,0), (200,0,100), (0,200,100), (100,0,200), (0,100,200). So, 6 solutions where one variable is zero, another is 200, and the third is 100.

So

---------------

, in addition to the case where a=b=c=100, which is one solution, we have 6 solutions where one variable is zero, another is 200, and the third is 100. So, total of 7 solutions so far.

Wait, but wait

---------------

, let me verify if these satisfy the second equation.

Take (200,100,0):

a²b +a²c +b²a +b²c +c²a +c²b
=200²*100 +200²*0 +100²*200 +100²*0 +0²*200 +0²*100
=40,000*100 + 0 +10,000*200 + 0 +0 +0
=4,000,000 + 2,000,000
=6,000,000. Correct.

Similarly, for (100,200,0), same result.

Now, what about the case where two variables are zero? Let's say b=c=0, then a=300.

Then the second equation becomes:

a²b +a²c +b²a +b²c +c²a +c²b =300²*0 +300²*0 +0²*300 +0²*0 +0²*300 +0²*0=0.

Which is not equal to 6,000,000. So, cases where two variables are zero are invalid.

So, so far, we have 7 solutions: 6 with one zero and two variables 200 and 100, and one solution with all variables 100.

Wait, but wait, let

---------------

 me check if there are other solutions where none of the variables are zero.

Suppose that a, b, c are all positive integers. Let me see if there are other solutions besides a=b=c=100.

Hmm. Let me consider the case where one of the variables is 100, and the others add up to 200. Let's say a=100, then b + c=200.

Substituting into the second equation:

a²b +a²c +b²a +b²c +c²a +c²b.

=100²b +100²c +b²*100 +b²c +c²*100 +c²b.

=10,000b +10,000c +100b² +b²c +100c² +c²b.

Factor:

=10,000(b + c) +100(b² +c²) + bc(b + c).

Since b + c=200, let's substitute:

=10,000*200 +100(b² +c²) + bc*200.

=2,000,000 +100(b² +c²) +200 bc.

We want this equal to6,000,000.

So:

2,000,000 +100(b² +c²) +200 bc =6,000,000.

Subtract 2,000,000:

100(b² +c²) +200 bc =4,000,000.

Divide both sides by 100:

b² +c² +2 bc =40,000.

Notice that b² +2bc +c² = (b +c)^2.

So, (b +c)^2 =40,000.

Since b +c=200, 200²=40,000. So, 40,000=40,000, which is always true.

Wait, that's interesting. So, in this case, when a=100, and b +c=200, the second equation is automatically satisfied for any b and c such that b +c=200.

Wait, that's a surprise

---------------

. So, if a=100, then any b and c that add up to 200 will satisfy the second equation.

But wait, that can't be right because when I tried

---------------

 a=100, b=100, c=100, that's a solution, but what about other values?

Wait, for example, let me take a=100, b=150, c=50. Then, a +b +c=300.

Compute the second equation:

a²b +a²c +b²a +b²c +c²a +c²b.

=100²*150 +100²*50 +150²*100 +150²*50 +50²*100 +50²*150.

Compute each term:

100²=10,000.

10,000*150=1,500,000.

10,000*50=500,000.

150²=22,500.

22,500*100=2,250,000.

22,500*50=1,125,000.

50²=2,500.

2,500*100=250,000.

2,500*150=375,000.

Adding all together:

1,500,000 +500,000 =2,000,000.

2,250,000 +1,125,000 =3,375,000.

250,000 +375,000 =625,000.

Total: 2,000,000 +3,375,000 +625,000 =6,000,000.

Wow, so that works. So, when a=100, any b and c that add up to 200 will satisfy the second equation.

Similarly, if a=100, then b and c can be any nonnegative integers such that b +c=200. So, the number of solutions in this case is the number of nonnegative integer solutions to b +c=200, which is 201 (from b=0 to b=200).

But wait, but in this case, a=100, so the triple is (100, b, c), where b +c=200. So, the number of such triples is 201. But wait, that's a lot more than 6 solutions I thought earlier. But wait, earlier when I considered c=0, I found 6 solutions, but perhaps

---------------

 those are included in this case where a=100.

Wait, but in the case where a=100, and c=0, then b=200, which gives the triple (100,200,0), which is one of the 6 solutions I found earlier. Similarly, when a=100, b=0, c=200, that's another solution, but in that case, the triple is (100,0,200), which is also among the 6. Wait, but in

---------------

 the case where a=100, and b=100, c=100, that's the solution where all are 100.

But wait, according

---------------

 to this, when a=100, any b and c adding up to 200 will satisfy the condition, so that would include all

---------------

 permutations where a=100, and the other two variables add up to 200.

But wait, but

---------------

 the problem counts triples (a, b, c), so if a=100, and b and c can be any pair adding up to 200, then the number of such triples is 201.

Similarly, if b=100, then a +c=200, and the second equation is satisfied, giving another 201 triples. And if c=100, then a +b=200, giving another 201 triples.

Wait, but wait, that would imply

---------------

 3*201=603 solutions, but that's not possible because when a=100, b=100, c=100, that's counted in all three cases, leading to overcounting.

Wait, but let

---------------

's think again. When I set a=100, I get 201 solutions where b +c=200. Similarly, when I set b=100, I get 201 solutions where a +c=200. And when I set c=100, I get 201 solutions where a +b=200.

But these

---------------

 sets overlap. For example, the triple (100,100,100) is counted three times, once in each case. Similarly, the triples where two variables are 100 would be counted twice. Wait, but in reality, the only triple where two variables are 100 is (100,100,100), because if two variables are 100, the third must be 100 as well.

Wait, no. Let me see. Suppose a=100, and b=100, then c=100. So, that's the only case where two variables are 100.

But in the cases where a=100, and b and c are such that b +c=200, but

---------------

 not necessarily both being 100.

Wait, but if I count all a=100, b +c=200, that's 201 triples. Similarly, all b=100, a +c=200, another 201, and all c=100, a +b=200, another 201.

But the

---------------

 total number of unique triples would be 3*201 - 3*1 +1, but that might not be accurate.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of inclusion-exclusion. The total number of triples where a=100 OR b=100 OR c=100 is equal to the sum of each individual count minus the sum of the pairwise overlaps plus the triple overlap.

So, the

---------------

 number of triples where a=100 is 201, same for b=100 and c=100. The overlaps are when two variables are 100: a=100 and b=100, which requires c=100, so that's one triple. Similarly, a=100 and c=100,

---------------

 b=100; and b=100 and c=100, a=100. So, three overlaps, each of size 1. The triple overlap is just the one triple (100,100,100).

So, applying inclusion-exclusion:

Total = (201 + 201 + 201) - (1 +1 +1) +1
= 603 -3 +1
= 601.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense, because when a=100, and b=100, that's included

---------------

 in both a=100 and b=100 counts, so we subtract the overlaps. So, I think the correct count would be:

Number of triples where a=100:201.

Number where b=100:201.

Number where c=100:201.

Subtract the cases where two are 100: each such

---------------

 case is counted twice, so subtract 3*(1) =3.

Add back the case where all three are 100, which was subtracted too many times: add 1.

So, total=201*3 -3*1 +1=603 -3 +1=601.

But wait, that suggests that there are 601 solutions where at least one variable is 100. But earlier, I found 6 solutions where one variable is 0, another 200, and the third 100. So, perhaps these are included in the 601.

Wait, but wait

---------------

, when a=100, and c=0, then b=200. So, that's included in the 201 triples where a=100. Similarly for other permutations.

So, the 6 solutions where one variable is 0 and another is 200, with the third being 100, are included in the 601.

But wait, I

---------------

'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Earlier, when I set a=100, I found that any b and c adding up to 200 would satisfy the equation. So, that gives 201 solutions where a=100, b +c=200.

Similarly, for b=100, 201 solutions where a +c=200.

And for c=100, 201 solutions where a +b=200.

But when

---------------

 I add these up, I get 603, but this counts the cases where two variables are 100 multiple times.

Specific

---------------

ally, the triple (100,100,100) is counted three times: once in each case.

The cases where two variables are 100 and the third is 100, but that's only one triple.

Wait, no, if two variables are 100, the third must be 100 as well because a +b +c=300. So, the only triple where two variables are 100 is (100,100,100). So, the overlaps between the three cases are only that one triple.

So, using inclusion-exclusion, the total number of unique triples where at least one variable is 100 is:

201 +201 +201 - (number of overlaps where two variables are 100) + (number where all three are 100).

But the number of overlaps where two variables are 100 is zero, because if two variables are 100, the third must be 100 as well. So, the only triple where two variables are 100 is (100,100,100), which was counted three times in the initial sum, so we subtract 2 to account for the overcounting.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the inclusion-exclusion formula is:

Total = (A + B + C) - (AB + AC + BC) + (ABC),

where A is the set of triples where a=100, B where b=100, C where c=100.

So, |A|=|B|=|C|=201.

|AB| is the number of triples where a=100 and b=100, which implies c=100. So, |AB|=1.

Similarly, |AC|=1 and |BC|=1.

|ABC|=1, the triple where a=b=c=100.

So, applying inclusion-exclusion:

Total = |A| + |B| + |C| - |AB| - |AC| - |BC| + |ABC|
= 201 +201 +201 -1 -1 -1 +1
=603 -3 +1
=601.

So, there are 601 unique triples where at least one variable is 100.

But wait, earlier, I found that when a=100, any b and c adding to 200 work, which includes the cases where one of them is zero. So, those 6 solutions are included in the 601.

But earlier

---------------

, when I considered a=100, b=150, c=50, that's a valid solution, and it's included in the 201 when a=100.

So, does

---------------

 that mean that all solutions are either where one variable is 100 and the other two add up to 200, or where one variable is zero, another is 200, and the third is 100?

Wait, no, because when I set a=100, I get all possible b and c adding to 200, including cases where one of them is zero, like

---------------

 b=200, c=0, which gives the triple (100,200,0), which is among the 6 solutions I found earlier.

So, the 6 solutions are included in the 601.

But wait, when

---------------

 I thought that when a=100, b and c can be any pair adding to 200, that includes all possible nonnegative integer solutions. So, that would give 201 solutions for each variable being 100, but with overlaps only at (100,100,100).

But wait

---------------

, when a=100, b can be from 0 to 200, and c=200 -b, so that's 201 solutions.

Similarly for b=100 and c=100.

So, in total, the number of solutions where at least one variable is 100 is 601, as per inclusion-exclusion.

But earlier, when I considered a=100, b=100, c=100, that's one solution, and when a=100, b=200, c=0, that's another solution, and so on.

So, in

---------------

 addition to these, are there any other solutions where none of the variables are 100?

Wait, suppose that none of the variables are 100. Then, a, b, c are all different from 100. But does

---------------

 such a solution exist?

Wait, let me try to find such a solution.

Suppose that a=150, b=150, c=0. Then, a +b +c=300.

Compute the second equation:

a²b +a²c +b²a +b²c +c²a +c²b
=150²*150 +150²*0 +150²*150 +150²*0 +0²*150 +0²*150
=2*(150^3)
=2*(3,375,000)
=6,750,000.

Which is larger than 6,000,000. So, that's not a solution.

Alternatively, try a=120, b=120, c=60.

a +b +c=300.

Compute the second equation:

a²b +a²c +b²a +b²c +c²a +c²b.

=120²*120 +120²*60 +120²*120 +120²*60 +60²*120 +60²*120.

Compute each term:

120²=14,400.

14,400*120=1,728,000.

14,400*60=864,000.

Same for the other terms:

14,400*120=1,728,000.

14,400*60=864,000.

60²=3,600.

3,600*120=432,000.

3,600*120=432,000.

Adding all together:

1,728,000 +864,000 =2,592,000.

Another 1,728,000 +864,000 =2,592,000.

And 432,000 +432,000=864,000.

Total: 2,592,000 +2,592,000 +864,000 =6,048,000.

Which is more than 6,000,000. So, that's not a solution.

Hmm, perhaps trying a=150, b=75, c=75.

a +b +c=300.

Compute the second equation:

a²b +a²c +b²a +b²c +c²a +c²b.

=150²*75 +150²*75 +75²*150 +75²*75 +75²*150 +75²*75.

Compute each term:

150²=22,500.

22,500*75=1,687,500.

Same for the next term: 1,687,500.

75²=5,625.

5,625*150=843,750.

5,625*75=421,875.

Same for the other terms: 843,750 and 421,875.

Adding all together:

1,687,500 +1,687,500 =3,375,000.

843,750 +843,750 =1,687,500.

421,875 +421,875 =843,750.

Total: 3,375,000 +1,687,500 +843,750 =5,906,250.

Which is less than 6,000,000.

Hmm, so perhaps there are no solutions where none of the variables are 100, except for the ones where one variable is 100 and the others add up to 200.

Wait, but earlier, when a=100, any b and c adding up to 200 works, which includes cases where one of them is zero.

So, perhaps all solutions are either where one variable is 100 and the others add up to 200, or where one variable is zero, another is 200, and the third is 100.

Wait, but in

---------------

 that case, the number of solutions would be 3*201 (for each variable being 100) but subtracting overlaps.

Wait, but earlier, when I applied

---------------

 inclusion-exclusion, I got 601 solutions where at least one variable is 100. But in reality, when a=100, any

---------------

 b and c adding to 200 is allowed, which includes the cases where b or c is zero.

So, the 6 solutions where one variable is zero are included in the 601.

But then, what

---------------

 about other solutions where none of the variables are zero or 100? From the earlier tests, it seems difficult to find such solutions, as they either fall short or exceed the required value.

Wait, but let's consider a=50, b=150, c=100. Then a +b +c=300.

Compute the second equation:

a²b +a²c +b²a +b²c +c²a +c²b.

=50²*150 +50²*100 +150²*50 +150²*100 +100²*50 +100²*150.

Compute each term:

50²=2,500.

2,500*150=375,000.

2,500*100=250,000.

150²=22,500.

22,500*50=1,125,000.

22,500*100=2,250,000.

100²=10,000.

10,000*50=500,000.

10,000*150=1,500,000.

Adding all together:

375,000 +250,000 =625,000.

1,125,000 +2,250,000 =3,375,000.

500,000 +1,500,000 =2,000,000.

Total: 625,000 +3,375,000 +2,000,000 =6,000,000.

So, that's a valid solution. Here, a=50, b=150, c=100. But in this case, c=100, which is included in the 601 solutions where at least one variable is 100.

Similarly, if I take a=75, b=125, c=100, that's another solution where c=100, so it's included in the 601.

So, perhaps all solutions are covered

---------------

 by the cases where at least one variable is 100, including the cases where one variable is zero, another is 200, and the third is 100.

So, the total number of solutions is 601.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that when a=100, any b and c adding to 200 would work, which gives 201 solutions for a=100, and similarly for b=100 and c=100. But when I apply

---------------

 inclusion-exclusion, I get 601 unique solutions.

But wait, I'm getting confused because when a=100, and b=100, c=100 is a solution, but when a=100, b=200, c=0 is another solution, and so on. So, perhaps all possible solutions are captured by the cases where at least one variable is 100.

But earlier

---------------

, when I tried a=50, b=150, c=100, which is a valid solution, and c=100, so it's included in the 601.

So, perhaps the total number of solutions is 601.

Wait, but wait, when I set a=100, I get 201 solutions where b +c=200, which includes the cases where b=0, c=200, and so on. Similarly for b=100 and c=100.

So, the total number of solutions would be the number of triples where at least one variable is 100, which is 601.

But let me verify with another example. Take a=100, b=50, c=150. Then, a +b +c=300.

Compute the second equation:

a²b +a²c +b²a +b²c +c²a +c²b.

=100²*50 +100²*150 +50²*100 +50²*150 +150²*100 +150²*50.

=10,000*50 +10,000*150 +2,500*100 +2,500*150 +22,500*100 +22,500*50.

=500,000 +1,500,000 +250,000 +375,000 +2,250,000 +1,125,000.

Adding together:

500,000 +1,500,000 =2,000,000.

250,000 +375,000 =625,000.

2,250,000 +1,125,000 =3,375,000.

Total: 2,000,000 +625,000 +3,375,000 =6,000,000. Correct.

So, that's another valid solution, included in the 601.

So, perhaps all solutions are captured

---------------

 by the cases where at least one variable is 100, leading to 601 solutions.

But wait, earlier when I considered a=100, I found that the equation is satisfied for any b and c adding up to 200. So, that would mean that the number of solutions is 3*(201) - 3*(1) +1=601.

But wait

---------------

, the problem statement requires nonnegative integers, so including zero.

So, the total number of solutions would be 601.

But wait, earlier I found 6 solutions where one variable is zero, another is 200, and the third is 100. So

---------------

, those are included in the 601.

So, the final answer is 601.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inclusion-exclusion.

Each of the cases where a=100, b=100, c=100 has 201 solutions. But the overlaps occur when two variables are 100, which is only possible when all three are 100, which is one solution.

So, the inclusion-exclusion formula would be:

Total = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |B∩C| + |A∩B∩C|.

Where |A|=|B|=|C|=201.

|A∩B| is the number of solutions where a=100 and b=100, which requires c=100, so |A∩B|=1.

Similarly, |A∩C|=1 and |B∩C|=1.

|A∩B∩C|=1.

So, total=201+201+201 -1-1-1 +1=603-3+1=601.

Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the number of triples is 601.


The number of triples is found by considering cases where at least one variable is 100, using inclusion-exclusion principle. The total is 601.
