Okay, so I have this problem about Aya's morning walk. Let me try to understand what's given and what I need to find. 

First, every morning Aya walks 9 kilometers. She goes at a constant speed, s kilometers per hour. The walk takes her 4 hours, but that includes t minutes she spends in a coffee shop. So, the total time she takes, including the coffee stop, is 4 hours. 

Then, when she increases her walking speed to s + 2 km/h, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including the same t minutes in the coffee shop. So, the

---------------

 total time here is 2 hours and 24 minutes. 

The question is asking me to find the number of minutes her walk takes when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including t minutes in the coffee shop. 

Alright, so I think I need to set up some equations based on the information given. Let me break

---------------

 it down.

First, when she walks at speed s km/h, the time taken is 4 hours, which includes t minutes. Wait, but time is usually in hours when dealing with km/h. So maybe I should convert t minutes into hours. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, t minutes would be t/60 hours. 

So, the total time for the walk and coffee is 4 hours. That means the actual walking time is 4 hours minus t/60 hours. 

Similarly, when she walks at s + 2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert that into hours. 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours, so total time is 2.4 hours. Again, the actual walking time is 2.4 hours minus t/60 hours. 

Wait, but the walking time can

---------------

 also be calculated based on distance and speed. Since the distance is 9 km, the time taken to walk is 9 divided by the speed. 

So, for the first case: walking time is 9/s hours. And the total time is walking time + t/60 hours. Which equals 4 hours. 

So, equation one: 9/s + t/60 = 4.

Similarly, for the second case: walking time is 9/(s + 2) hours. And the total time is 2.4 hours, so equation two: 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4.

Now I have two equations with two variables, s and t. I can solve these simultaneously to find s and t. Once I have s, I can compute the time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including t minutes in the coffee shop.

Let me write down the equations:

1. 9/s + t/60 = 4
2. 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate t. Let's see:

Equation 1 minus Equation 2:

[9/s + t/60] - [9/(s + 2) + t/60] = 4 - 2.4

Simplify:

9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

Let me compute 9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6.

Factor out the 9:

9[1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 1.6

Compute the difference inside the brackets:

1/s - 1/(s + 2) = [ (s + 2) - s ] / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)]

So,

9 * [2 / (s(s + 2))] = 1.6

Which simplifies to:

18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6

Let me write that as:

18 = 1.6 * s(s + 2)

Divide both sides by 1.6 to solve for s(s + 2):

s(s + 2) = 18 / 1.6

Calculate 18 divided by 1.6:

1.6 goes into 18 how many times?

1.6 * 11 = 17.6, so 11 times with 0.4 remaining.

0.4 / 1.6 = 0.25, so 11.25

So, s(s + 2) = 11.25

So

---------------

, s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

That's a quadratic equation: s² + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Let me solve for s using the quadratic formula. 

s = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)

Here, a=1, b=2, c=-11.25.

So discriminant D = b² - 4ac = (2)^2 - 4*1*(-11.25) = 4 + 45 = 49

So sqrt(D) = 7.

Thus,

s = [ -2 ±7 ] / 2

We can discard the negative solution because speed can't be negative.

So,

s = ( -2 +7 ) / 2 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h

So, s is 2.5 km/h.

Now, let's find t. Using equation 1:

9/s + t/60 = 4

Substitute s = 2.5:

9 / 2.5 + t/60 = 4

Compute 9 / 2.5:

2.5 * 3.6 = 9, because 2.5 * 3 = 7.5 and 2.5 * 0.6 = 1.5, so 7.5 +1.5=9. So, 9/2.5=3.6.

So,

3.6 + t/60 =4

Subtract 3.6 from both sides:

t/60 = 0.4

Multiply both sides by 60:

t = 0.4 * 60 = 24 minutes.

So, t is 24 minutes.

Now, the question is when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h. So, s was 2.5, so s + 1/2 is 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h.

So, her new speed is 3 km/h.

Now, compute the total time, which includes the walking time and t (24 minutes).

First, walking time is 9 km divided by 3 km/h, which is 3 hours.

So, walking time is 3 hours, plus t =24 minutes.

So, total time is 3 hours and 24 minutes.

Wait, but the question says "the number of minutes the walk takes her, including t minutes". So, I

---------------

 need to convert 3 hours and 24 minutes into total minutes.

3 hours is 180 minutes, plus 24 minutes is 204 minutes.

So, the answer is 204 minutes.

Let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, s was found as 2.5 km/h. Then

---------------

, t was 24 minutes.

At speed 3 km/h, walking time is 9/3=3 hours. 3 hours is 180 minutes. Adding t=24 minutes, total is 204 minutes. That seems right.

Another

---------------

 way to verify: when s=2.5, walking time is 9/2.5=3.6 hours, which is 3 hours and 36 minutes. Adding t=24 minutes, total time is 4 hours and 0 minutes, which matches the first condition.

When s=2.5+2=4.5 km/h, walking time is 9/4.5=2 hours. Adding t=24 minutes, total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which matches the second condition.

So, all conditions are satisfied.

Thus, the answer is 204 minutes.


Aya walks 9 kilometers at a constant speed of \( s \) km/h, taking 4 hours including \( t \) minutes in a coffee shop. When her speed increases to \( s+2 \) km/h, the walk takes 2 hours and 24 minutes, still including \( t \) minutes. We need to find the total time in minutes when she walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/h, including \( t \) minutes.

First, convert the total times into hours:
- 4 hours is 4 hours.
- 2 hours and 24 minutes is \( 2 + \frac{24}{60} = 2.4 \) hours.

Set up the equations:
1. \( \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4 \)
2. \( \frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4 \)

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:
\[
\frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s+2} = 1.6
\]
Simplify:
\[
9 \left( \frac{1}{s} - \frac{1}{s+2} \right) = 1.6
\]
\[
9 \left( \frac{2}{s(s+2)} \right) = 1.6
\]
\[
\frac{18}{s(s+2)} = 1.6
\]
\[
s(s+2) = \frac{18}{1.6} = 11.25
\]
\[
s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0
\]

Solve the quadratic equation:
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 45}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 7}{2}
\]
Take the positive root:
\[
s = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \, \text{km/h}
\]

Find \( t \) using equation 1:
\[
\frac{9}{2.5} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
\[
3.6 + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
\[
\frac{t}{60} = 0.4 \implies t = 24 \, \text{minutes}
\]

When Aya walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h:
- Walking time: \( \frac{9}{3} = 3 \) hours.
- Total time: \( 3 \) hours \( 24 \) minutes \( = 204 \) minutes.
