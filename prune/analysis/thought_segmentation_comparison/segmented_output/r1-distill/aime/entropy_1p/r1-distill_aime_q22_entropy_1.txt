Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand it step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening horizontally. The transverse axis is along the x-axis, and the conjugate axis is along the y-axis.

The points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, and they form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.

In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, if the diagonals intersect at the origin, then the diagonals are along

---------------

 the coordinate axes? Wait, not necessarily. Because the hyperbola is symmetric about both axes, but the rhombus could have its diagonals along any lines through the origin. Hmm, but in

---------------

 this case, the hyperbola is symmetric about both the x and y axes, so maybe the diagonals are along these axes? Or could they be along other lines?

Wait, no, the rhombus is determined

---------------

 by four points on the hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin. So, the diagonals are lines passing through the origin, but not necessarily the x and y axes. So, the

---------------

 diagonals can be at any angle, as long as they pass through the origin.

Since it's a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, if one diagonal has a slope m, the other will have a slope of -1/m, because they are perpendicular.

But the

---------------

 diagonals of a rhombus are not necessarily aligned with the coordinate axes. So, in this problem, the rhombus can be rotated.

Let

---------------

 me consider the properties of the rhombus. The diagonals bisect each other at the origin, so if one vertex is at (a, b), the opposite vertex is at (-a, -b). Similarly, the other two vertices are at some (c, d) and (-c, -d). Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal in length.

So, the four points are (a, b), (-a, -b), (c, d), (-c, -d). Since

---------------

 it's a rhombus, the distance between (a, b) and (c, d) should be equal to the distance between (c, d) and (-a, -b), and so on.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to parametrize the points on the hyperbola. Since the hyperbola is x²/20 - y²/24 =1, any

---------------

 point on it can be written in terms of hyperbola parametric equations. For hyperbola, the parametric equations are x = a secθ, y = b tanθ, where a²=20, so a=2√5, and b²=24, so b=2√6.

Wait, but

---------------

 hyperbola parametrization is usually in terms of hyperbolic functions. Alternatively, it's sometimes written as x = a cosh t, y = b sinh t, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, using

---------------

 trigonometric functions with a parameter θ, but it's a hyperbola, so maybe using θ as a hyperbolic angle.

Alternatively, perhaps using points symmetric with respect to the origin. Since the origin is the intersection point of the diagonals, and

---------------

 the diagonals are perpendicular, the four points can be considered as (p, q), (-p, -q), (r, s), (-r, -s), such that the diagonals are from (p, q) to (-p, -q) and (r, s) to (-r, -s). These diagonals are perpendicular, so the dot product of vectors (p, q) and (r, s) should be zero. So, pr + qs = 0.

Additionally

---------------

, all four points lie on the hyperbola, so (p²)/20 - (q²)/24 = 1, and similarly for (r, s): (r²)/20 - (s²)/24 = 1.

Since

---------------

 it's a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between (p, q) and (r, s) should be equal to the distance between (r, s) and (-p, -q), and so on.

Wait, maybe I

---------------

 can think in terms of vectors. Let me denote vectors OA = (p, q) and OC = (r, s). Then, since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. The

---------------

 vectors AB and AD can be expressed in terms of OA and OC.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: since the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, the rhombus can be considered as a paralle

---------------

logram with perpendicular diagonals. So, in such a case, the vertices are at (p, q), (-q, p), (-p, -q), (q, -p), but scaled appropriately. Hmm, maybe that's too

---------------

 specific.

Alternatively, let's consider that in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, the vertices

---------------

 can be thought of as lying along two perpendicular lines through the origin.

But the hyperbola is symmetric with respect to both the x-axis and y-axis, but not necessarily other lines. So, perhaps the diagonals are not along the axes but along some other perpendicular lines.

Let me consider that the diagonals are along two lines y = m x and y = (-1/m) x, since they are perpendicular. So, points A and C lie on one diagonal, say y = m x, and points B and D lie on the other diagonal y = (-1/m) x.

Since A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, let me find their coordinates.

For points on the diagonal y = m x: substit

---------------

uting into the hyperbola equation,

x²/20 - (m² x²)/24 = 1.

So, x² (1/20 - m²/24) = 1.

Similarly, for the other diagonal y = (-1/m) x: substituting,

x²/20 - ( (1/m²) x² ) /24 = 1.

So, x² (1/20 - 1/(24 m²)) = 1.

Wait

---------------

, but since both diagonals must have points on the hyperbola, these equations must have real solutions. So, the coefficients must be positive,

---------------

 otherwise x² would be negative, which isn't possible.

So, for the first diagonal y = m x:

1/20 - m²/24 > 0 ⇒ m² < 24/20 = 6/5. So, |m| < sqrt(6/5) ≈ 1.095.

Similarly, for the other diagonal y = (-1/m) x:

1/20 - 1/(24 m²) > 0 ⇒ 1/(24 m²) < 1/20 ⇒ 24 m² > 20 ⇒ m² > 20/24 = 5/6 ⇒ |m| > sqrt(5/6) ≈ 0.9129.

So, combining both conditions: sqrt(5/6) < |m| < sqrt(6/5).

Hmm

---------------

, interesting. So, m cannot be just any slope; it has to be within this range.

Now, the points on the first diagonal y = m x are (x, m x). Let me solve for x:

x² (1/20 - m²/24) = 1 ⇒ x² = 1 / (1/20 - m²/24).

Similarly, for the other diagonal, the points are (x, (-1/m) x), and substituting into the hyperbola equation, we get x² = 1 / (1/20 - 1/(24 m²)).

So, the coordinates of the points A and C on the first diagonal would be (sqrt(1/(1/20 - m²/24)), m sqrt(1/(1/20 - m²/24))) and (-sqrt(...), -m sqrt(...)).

Similarly, points B and D on the second diagonal would be (sqrt(1/(1/20 - 1/(24 m²))), (-1/m) sqrt(1/(1/20 - 1/(24 m²)))) and (-sqrt(...), (1/m) sqrt(...)).

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. Let me compute the distance between A and B, and set it equal to the distance between B and C, etc. But maybe it's easier to compute the vectors and set their magnitudes equal.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I can think of the rhombus as having two diagonals of lengths 2p and 2q, where p and q are the distances from the origin to points A and B, respectively. But since the diagonals are perpendicular, the area of the rhombus would be (2p)(2q)/2 = 2 p q.

But maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, let

---------------

's denote the distance from the origin to point A as OA = sqrt(p² + q²), but in this case, points A and C are on the diagonal y = m x, so their coordinates are (a, m a) and (-a, -m a). Similarly, points B and D are on y = (-1/m) x, so their coordinates are (b, (-1/m) b) and (-b, (1/m) b).

So, OA = sqrt(a² + (m a)^2) = a sqrt(1 + m²).

Similarly, OB = sqrt(b² + ( (1/m) b )^2 ) = b sqrt(1 + 1/m²).

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. Let's compute the distance between A and B.

Point A: (a, m a), Point B: (b, (-1/m) b).

Distance AB squared: (a - b)^2 + (m a + (1/m) b)^2.

Similarly, distance BC squared: (b - (-a))^2 + ((-1/m) b - m a)^2.

Wait, but in a rhombus, all sides are equal, so AB = BC. So, AB

---------------

² = BC².

Let me compute AB² and BC².

AB² = (a - b)^2 + (m a + (1/m) b)^2.

Expanding this:

= a² - 2 a b + b² + m² a² + 2 m a*(1/m) b + (1/m²) b².

Simplify:

= a² - 2 a b + b² + m² a² + 2 a b + (1/m²) b².

Combine like terms:

= (1 + m²) a² + (1 + 1/m²) b².

Similarly, BC² is the distance between B and C.

Point B: (b, (-1/m) b), Point C: (-a, -m a).

Distance BC squared: (b + a)^2 + ( (-1/m) b + m a )^2.

Expanding:

= (a + b)^2 + ( m a - (1/m) b )^2.

= a² + 2 a b + b² + m² a² - 2 m a (1/m) b + (1/m²) b².

Simplify:

= a² + 2 a b + b² + m² a² - 2 a b + (1/m²) b².

Combine like terms:

= (1 + m²) a² + (1 + 1/m²) b².

So, AB² = BC². So, that

---------------

 condition is automatically satisfied. Hmm, interesting.

So, perhaps all sides being equal is automatically satisfied because the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other? Maybe not

---------------

, perhaps there's another condition.

Wait, maybe I need to ensure that the sides are equal, but in this case, AB

---------------

² and BC² are equal, so that's already taken care of by the way we've constructed the points. Hmm, perhaps the

---------------

 other condition is that the sides are equal in the other direction as well, but I think this is sufficient because of the symmetry.

Wait, maybe not. Let me check the distance from A to B and from B to C. Wait

---------------

, in the calculation above, AB² and BC² are the same. So, that's a good sign.

But maybe

---------------

 I should also check another pair of sides, say AD and DC.

Point A: (a, m a), Point D: (-b, (1/m) b).

Distance AD squared: (a + b)^2 + (m a - (1/m) b)^2.

Which is the same as BC², which we already saw is equal to AB². So, yes

---------------

, all sides are equal. So, that condition is satisfied.

So, perhaps the only conditions we need are that the points lie on the hyperbola and that the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the

---------------

 diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, which gives us the condition pr + qs = 0 if points are (p, q) and (r, s).

Wait, but in our setup, points A and C are on one diagonal, and points B and D on the other. So, the vectors OA and OB are (a, m a) and (b, (-1/m) b). Their dot product is a*b + (m a)*(-1/m b) = a b - a b = 0. So, the diagonals are indeed perpendicular.

So, in

---------------

 this setup, the diagonals are perpendicular, and all sides are equal, so it's a rhombus.

Therefore, the only

---------------

 conditions we have are that the points lie on the hyperbola, and that the diagonals are perpendicular, which is already satisfied by our parametrization.

So, now, the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi.

Wait, BD is the diagonal from B to D. Wait, but in our setup, BD is from (b, (-1/m) b) to (-b, (1/m) b). So, the length of BD is the distance between these two points.

Distance BD squared: (b - (-b))² + ( (-1/m) b - (1/m) b )².

Simplify: (2 b)^2 + ( (-2/m) b )^2 = 4 b² + (4 / m²) b² = 4 b² (1 + 1/m²).

Similarly, the other diagonal AC is from (a, m a) to (-a, -m a). Its length squared is (2 a)^2 + (2 m a)^2 = 4 a² + 4 m² a² = 4 a² (1 + m²).

So, BD² = 4 b² (1 + 1/m²), AC² = 4 a² (1 + m²).

But from

---------------

 the hyperbola equation, we have expressions for a² and b².

From the first diagonal y = m x, substituting into hyperbola:

x² /20 - y² /24 =1 ⇒ x² (1/20 - m² /24) =1 ⇒ x² = 1 / (1/20 - m² /24).

So, a² = 1 / (1/20 - m² /24).

Similarly, for the other diagonal y = (-1/m) x:

x² /20 - y² /24 =1 ⇒ x² (1/20 - (1/m²)/24 ) =1 ⇒ x² = 1 / (1/20 - 1/(24 m²)).

So, b² = 1 / (1/20 - 1/(24 m²)).

So, BD² =4 * [1 / (1/20 - 1/(24 m²))] * (1 + 1/m²).

Similarly, AC² =4 * [1 / (1/20 - m² /24 )] * (1 + m²).

But we need to find BD² and find the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD², but the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, we're to find the infimum of BD², which

---------------

 is the minimum possible BD², but wait, no: the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi. So, it's like the supremum of the lower bounds, which is the infimum.

Wait, let

---------------

 me clarify. The problem asks for the greatest number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, it's the infimum of BD² over all possible rhombi, which would be the minimum value that BD² can take. Because for any number less than this infimum, there exists a rhombus with BD² less than that number. So, the greatest such number is the infimum itself, which is the minimal BD².

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. If we have a set S of BD² values, then the greatest number less than all elements of S is the infimum of S. So, if the infimum is attainable, then it's the minimum, otherwise, it's a limit.

So, our

---------------

 goal is to find the infimum of BD² over all possible rhombi as described.

So, to find the minimal BD², we can express BD² in terms of m and then find its minimum.

So, BD² is 4 b² (1 + 1/m²), and b² is 1 / (1/20 - 1/(24 m²)).

So, let's write BD² as:

BD² = 4 * [1 / (1/20 - 1/(24 m²))] * (1 + 1/m²).

Let me simplify this expression.

First, let me denote t = m². Since m² is positive and we have sqrt(5/6) < |m| < sqrt(6/5), so t is in (5/6, 6/5).

So, t ∈ (5/6, 6/5).

So, BD² becomes:

4 * [1 / (1/20 - 1/(24 t))] * (1 + 1/t).

Simplify the denominator:

1/20 - 1/(24 t) = (24 t - 20)/(20 * 24 t).

So, 1/(1/20 - 1/(24 t)) = (20 * 24 t)/(24 t - 20) = (480 t)/(24 t - 20).

So, BD² = 4 * (480 t)/(24 t - 20) * (1 + 1/t).

Simplify (1 + 1/t) = (t + 1)/t.

So, BD² = 4 * (480 t)/(24 t - 20) * (t + 1)/t.

Simplify:

The t in numerator and denominator cancels:

4 * 480 (t + 1)/(24 t - 20).

So, BD² = (4 * 480 (t + 1))/(24 t - 20).

Simplify constants:

4 * 480 = 1920.

So, BD² = 1920 (t + 1)/(24 t - 20).

Let me simplify the fraction:

(t + 1)/(24 t - 20).

We can factor numerator and denominator:

24 t - 20 = 4*(6 t -5).

So, BD² = 1920 (t + 1)/(4 (6 t -5)).

Simplify 1920 /4 = 480.

So, BD² = 480 (t +1)/(6 t -5).

Now, t is in (5/6, 6/5).

Let me write t as t = 5/6 + s, where s ranges from 0 to 1/6 (since t goes from 5/6 to 6/5 = 1.2, which is 5/6 + 1/6).

Wait, alternatively

---------------

, perhaps I can make a substitution to make it easier. Let me set u = 6 t -5. Then, when t = 5/6, u=0, and when t=6/5, u=6*(6/5) -5 = 36/5 -25/5 = 11/5.

So, u ∈ (0, 11/5).

Expressing t in terms of u: t = (u +5)/6.

So, t +1 = (u +5)/6 +1 = (u +5 +6)/6 = (u +11)/6.

So, BD² = 480 * ( (u +11)/6 ) / u.

Simplify:

480 /6 = 80.

So, BD² = 80 * (u +11)/u = 80*(1 + 11/u).

So, BD² =80*(1 + 11/u).

Now, u ranges from 0 to 11/5.

As u approaches 0 from the right, 11/u approaches infinity, so BD² approaches infinity.

As u approaches 11/5, BD² =80*(1 + 11/(11/5))=80*(1 +5)=80*6=480.

Wait, wait

---------------

, let me compute:

When u=11/5,

BD²=80*(1 +11/(11/5))=80*(1 +5)=80*6=480.

Wait, but u

---------------

 can't actually reach 11/5, because t can't reach 6/5 exactly, right? Because t is less than 6/5, so u approaches 11/5 but doesn't reach it. So, BD² approaches 480 from above.

Wait, but when u approaches 0, BD² approaches infinity. So, BD² can be as large as possible, but the problem is asking for the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, that

---------------

 is, the infimum of BD².

Wait, but BD² can be as small as approaching 480, but can

---------------

't be smaller than that. Because when u approaches 11/5, BD² approaches 480. So, 480 is the infimum. So, the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480.

Wait, but let me check.



---------------

Wait, when u approaches 11/5, t approaches 6/5, which is the upper limit of t. So, BD² approaches 480.

But can

---------------

 BD² actually attain 480? No, because t cannot be equal to 6/5, as that would make the denominator in the expression for b² zero, which would make b² undefined.

So, BD² can get arbitrarily close to 480 but never actually reaches it. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480. Because for any number less than 480, there exists a rhombus with BD² less than that number? Wait, no. Wait, no

---------------

, because BD² approaches 480 from above, meaning BD² can be made as close to 480 as desired, but never less than 480.

Wait, no, wait

---------------

. Wait, BD² is equal to 80*(1 + 11/u), and u is positive. So, when u approaches 0, BD² approaches infinity, and when u approaches 11/5, BD² approaches 480.

So, the minimal value BD² can take is approaching 480 from above. So, 480 is the infimum, but it's not attainable. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 480. Because BD² is always greater than 480, so 480 is the lower bound, and the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480.

Wait, but let

---------------

 me double-check the calculation.

Starting from BD² = 480*(t +1)/(6t -5).

Wait

---------------

, no, earlier substitution:

Wait, no, I think I made a substitution mistake.

Wait, let's go back.

Earlier, we had BD² = 480*(t +1)/(6t -5).

Wait, no

---------------

, wait, when I set u =6t -5, t = (u +5)/6.

So, t +1 = (u +5)/6 +1 = (u +5 +6)/6 = (u +11)/6.

So, BD² =480*( (u +11)/6 ) / u = 480*(u +11)/(6 u).

Which simplifies to 80*(u +11)/u =80*(1 + 11/u).

So, as u approaches 11/5, which is the upper limit, since

---------------

 u =6t -5, and t approaches 6/5, so u approaches 6*(6/5) -5 =36/5 -25/5=11/5.

So, when u approaches 11/5, 11/u approaches 5. So, 1 +11/u approaches 6, so BD² approaches 80*6=480.

So

---------------

, yes, as u approaches 11/5, BD² approaches 480.

But when u approaches 0, BD² approaches infinity.

So, BD² can be made as close to 480 as we like, but never less than 480.

Therefore, the infimum of BD² is 480, meaning BD² is always greater than 480.

So, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 480.

Wait, but the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, 

---------------

480 is the infimum, meaning that for any number less than 480, there exists a rhombus with BD² less than that number? No, wait, that's not correct.

Wait, no

---------------

. The infimum is the greatest lower bound, meaning that BD² is always greater than or equal to 480, but since BD² can't actually be 480, it's always greater than 480. So, the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480, because for any number greater than 480, there exists a rhombus with BD² less than that number, but 480 itself is not attainable. So, 480 is the lower bound, and the greatest number less than all BD² is 480.

Wait, but

---------------

 I think I'm getting confused here. Let me think about it differently. If we're looking for the greatest number that is less than BD² for all rhombi, that would be the infimum of BD², because the infimum is the smallest value that is still less than or equal to all BD². But in this case, the infimum is 480, and BD² is always greater than 480. So, 480 is the greatest lower bound. Therefore, the answer is 480.

Wait, but let me confirm

---------------

 this with another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express BD² in terms of t, then find its minimum.

We have BD² =480*(t +1)/(6t -5), where t ∈ (5/6, 6/5).

Let me set f(t) = (t +1)/(6t -5).

We can find the minimum of f(t) over t ∈ (5/6, 6/5).

Compute derivative of f(t):

f(t) = (t +1)/(6t -5).

f’(t) = [ (1)(6t -5) - (t +1)(6) ] / (6t -5)^2.

Simplify numerator:

= [6t -5 -6t -6] = (-11).

So, f’(t) = (-11)/(6t -5)^2.

Since denominator is squared, it's always positive. So, f’(t) is negative for all t ≠5/6.

Thus, f(t) is decreasing on the interval t ∈ (5/6, 6/5).

So, its minimum occurs at t approaching 6/5, which is the upper limit.

So, the minimum of f(t) is lim t→(6/5)^- f(t) = lim t→6/5^- (t+1)/(6t -5).

Compute this limit:

As t approaches 6/5 from below, 6t approaches 36/5, so 6t -5 approaches 36/5 -25/5=11/5.

So, t+1 approaches 6/5 +1=11/5.

So, f(t) approaches (11/5)/(11/5)=1.

Wait, that's not possible because earlier substitution gave BD² approaching 480, which would correspond to f(t) approaching 1.

Wait, but BD

---------------

²=480*(t +1)/(6t -5).

If f(t) approaches 1, then BD² approaches 480*1=480.

Wait, but when

---------------

 t approaches 6/5, 6t-5 approaches 11/5, and t+1 approaches 11/5, so (t+1)/(6t-5) approaches (11/5)/(11/5)=1. So, yes, f(t) approaches 1, so BD² approaches 480*1=480.

Since f(t) is decreasing, the minimal value is 1, so the minimal BD² is 480.

But wait, that

---------------

's not possible because when t approaches 5/6 from above, let's see:

At t=5/6, 6t-5=6*(5/6)-5=5-5=0, which is the lower limit. So, as t approaches 5/6 from above, 6t-5 approaches 0 from above, so (t+1)/(6t-5) approaches (5/6 +1)/0^+ = (11/6)/0^+ → +infty. So, f(t) approaches infinity as t approaches 5/6 from above.

Thus, f(t) is decreasing from +infty to 1 as t increases from 5/6 to 6/5.

So, the minimal value of f(t) is 1, so

---------------

 the minimal BD² is 480*1=480.

Therefore, BD² can be made arbitrarily close to 480, but never less than 480. Hence, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 480.

So, the answer is 480.


The problem involves finding the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all rhombi \( ABCD \) inscribed in the hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \), with diagonals intersecting at the origin.

1. **Hyperbola and Rhombus Properties**:
   - The hyperbola is centered at the origin and symmetric about both axes.
   - The rhombus \( ABCD \) has its diagonals intersecting at the origin and is symmetric with respect to both axes.

2. **Parametrization of Points**:
   - Points \( A \) and \( C \) lie on one diagonal with slope \( m \), and points \( B \) and \( D \) lie on the other diagonal with slope \( -1/m \).
   - Substituting the diagonal equations into the hyperbola gives expressions for \( a^2 \) and \( b^2 \), the squares of the distances from the origin to points on the diagonals.

3. **Expression for \( BD^2 \)**:
   - Using the parametrization, \( BD^2 \) is expressed in terms of \( m \) and simplified to \( BD^2 = 480 \cdot \frac{t + 1}{6t - 5} \), where \( t = m^2 \).
   - The range of \( t \) is \( \frac{5}{6} < t < \frac{6}{5} \).

4. **Minimizing \( BD^2 \)**:
   - By analyzing the function \( f(t) = \frac{t + 1}{6t - 5} \), it is found to be decreasing over the interval \( \left( \frac{5}{6}, \frac{6}{5} \right) \).
   - As \( t \) approaches \( \frac{6}{5} \), \( BD^2 \) approaches 480, but never actually reaches it.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The infimum of \( BD^2 \) is 480, meaning \( BD^2 \) is always greater than 480 for all such rhombi.
   - Therefore, the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all rhombi is **480**.

The final answer is:
\boxed{480}<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
