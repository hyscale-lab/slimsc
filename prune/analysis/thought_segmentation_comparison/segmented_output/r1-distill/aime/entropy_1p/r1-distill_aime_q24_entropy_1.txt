Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the problem says there are 900 residents in total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. So, candy hearts are universal—everybody has that. Then, there are other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades. The numbers are 195 owning a diamond ring, 367 owning golf clubs, and 562 owning a garden spade. 

Wait, but hold

---------------

 on. The total number of people is 900, but each person owns at least a candy heart. So, when they talk about people owning other things, they're in

---------------

 addition to the candy hearts. But the candy hearts are already included for everyone. 

The problem then states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. We

---------------

're supposed to find how many own all four. Hmm. So, all four would be those who have the candy hearts plus the other three items.

Wait, but wait

---------------

 again. Wait, the candy hearts are owned by everyone, so when it says someone owns exactly two of these things, does that mean two of the other items plus the candy hearts? Or does it mean exactly two among

---------------

 all four, including candy hearts? Hmm, that's a critical point. 

Let me think. The way the problem is phrased: "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, the candy hearts are a given for everyone. Then, the other three items are additional. So, when it says someone owns exactly two of these things, I think it's referring to the other three things, not including candy hearts. Because otherwise, if you include candy hearts, then everyone already has at least one, and you can't have exactly two without considering candy hearts. 

But wait, the

---------------

 problem says "exactly two of these things." The way it's written, the things are the four: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. So, does

---------------

 "exactly two" include the candy hearts? Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. Let me read the problem again.

It

---------------

 says, "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, the candy hearts are a separate thing. Then, it mentions the number of people owning diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. Then, it says, "there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things." 

So, the "these things" here

---------------

 would refer to the four: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. Because that's what was just mentioned. So, if

---------------

 someone owns exactly two of these, that includes the possibility of having the candy hearts plus one other. Wait, but that would mean that each

---------------

 person owns at least the candy hearts, so "exactly two" would mean two things in total, including the candy hearts. So, for example, someone could have the candy hearts and a diamond ring—so exactly two. Or the candy hearts and a golf club, etc. 

Wait, but that

---------------

 complicates things. Because in that case, the number of people owning exactly two of these four items would include those who have the candy hearts plus one other. Similarly, exactly three would include those who have the candy hearts plus two others, and so on. 

But maybe

---------------

 another approach is to model this using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's try that. 

Let me denote the sets as follows:
- Let D be the set of people owning a diamond ring.
- Let G be the set of people owning golf clubs.
- Let S be the set of people owning a garden spade.
- Let C be the set of people owning candy hearts. Since everyone owns this, C is the universal set with 900 elements.

We are given:
- |D| = 195
- |G| = 367
- |S| = 562
- |C| = 900
- Number of people owning exactly two of these four items: 437
- Number owning exactly three: 234
- We need to find the number owning all four: |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|, which is the same as |D ∩ G ∩ S| since C is universal.

Wait, but since

---------------

 C is universal, any intersection that includes C is just the intersection of the other sets. So, for example, D ∩ C is just D, since everyone has C. So, if

---------------

 someone is in D ∩ C, they're just in D. So, in this case, the number of people who own exactly two of the four items would include people who have, say, D and G but not S or C? Wait, no, because C is already included in everyone. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as four sets where C is the universal set. So, when

---------------

 considering the other three sets (D, G, S), each is a subset of C. So, for inclusion-exclusion, we can think about the union

---------------

 of D, G, S within C.

But the problem is about the counts of people owning exactly two or exactly three of the four items, which include C. Wait, no, because C is owned

---------------

 by everyone. So, if someone owns exactly two of the four, it must include C plus one of the other three. Because if they don't have C, that's impossible—they all have C. So, exactly

---------------

 two would be C plus one other item. Similarly, exactly three would be C plus two others, and exactly four would be all four, which is C plus the other three.

Wait, but that seems

---------------

 to fit. So, let me try to model it this way.

Let me denote:
- a = number of people with exactly D and C (so only D and C)
- b = exactly G and C
- c = exactly S and C
- d = exactly D and G and C
- e = exactly D and S and C
- f = exactly G and S and C
- g = exactly D, G, S, and C (so all four)

Wait

---------------

, but in the problem statement, it says that 437 own exactly two of the four things, and 234 own exactly three. So, the exactly

---------------

 two would be a + b + c. The exactly three would be d + e + f. And the exactly four is g. 

But wait, in

---------------

 this model, a, b, c are exactly two, each including C. Similarly, d, e, f are exactly three, including C. And g is all four.

Now, the total number of people in each category is 437 exactly two, 234 exactly three, and we're looking for g, the exactly four. But

---------------

 wait, the problem says that these are the only possibilities? Or are there people who own only C? Because the problem says each of the 900 owns a bag of candy hearts, so everyone

---------------

 is in C. But the other items are optional. So, some people might own only C, some might own C and one other, C and two others, etc. 

Wait, the problem says that 437 own exactly two of the four, 234 own exactly three, and we're to find the number who own all four. But that

---------------

 doesn't account for everyone. Because there might be people who own only C, and not any of the other three. So, the total would be:

Number of people owning only C + exactly two (437) + exactly three (234) + exactly four (g) = 900.

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention the number of people owning only C. Hmm, but perhaps that's something

---------------

 we can calculate. Because if we know the total number in each category, we can find that.

Alternatively, maybe using inclusion-exclusion for the three sets D, G, S within the universal set C. Let's think about that.

The inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

But since C is the universal set, |D ∪ G ∪ S| is equal to the number of people who own at least one of D, G, or S. But wait, everyone owns C, but not everyone owns D, G, or S. So, the number of people who don't own D, G, or S is equal to the number of people who own only C. Let's denote that as x. So, x = 900 - |D ∪ G ∪ S|.

But I

---------------

 don't know if that's helpful yet. Let me think about the other approach.

We know the number of people in each category: exactly two, exactly three, exactly four, and only C. Let's denote:

- Only C: x
- Exactly two: a + b + c = 437
- Exactly three: d + e + f = 234
- Exactly four: g = ?

So, x + 437 + 234 + g = 900.

So, x + g = 900 - (437 + 234) = 900 - 671 = 229.

So, x + g = 229.

Now, we

---------------

 need another equation to relate x and g.

Let me think about how to compute |D|, |G|, |S| in terms of the other

---------------

 variables. Because each of |D|, |G|, |S| can be expressed as the sum of people who have only D, those who have D and another item, etc.

So, for example, |D| is the number of people who have D. These include:

- a (only D and C)
- d (D, G, and C)
- e (D, S, and C)
- g (all four)

Similarly, |G| includes:

- b (only G and C)
- d (D, G, C)
- f (G, S, C)
- g

And |S| includes:

- c (only S and C)
- e (D, S, C)
- f (G, S, C)
- g

So, we

---------------

 can write:

|D| = a + d + e + g = 195

|G| = b + d + f + g = 367

|S| = c + e + f + g = 562

We also know that a + b + c = 437 (exactly two items, including C)

And d + e + f = 234 (exactly three items, including C)

We have these

---------------

 three equations:

1. a + d + e + g = 195
2. b + d + f + g = 367
3. c + e + f + g = 562

And we have:

a + b + c = 437 (exactly two)
d + e + f = 234 (exactly three)

Also, x + g = 229 (from earlier)

We have 

---------------

6 variables: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and x. Wait, that's seven variables. But we have more

---------------

 equations. Let me count:

We have the three equations from |D|, |G|, |S|.

Then, we have a + b + c = 437

d + e + f = 234

And x + g = 229.

Wait, that's 5 equations, and variables are a, b, c, d, e, f, g, x. That's 8 variables. Hmm, maybe

---------------

 I'm missing another equation. Alternatively, perhaps I can find another relation.

Alternatively, perhaps we can sum the three equations from |D|, |G|, |S|.

Summing equations 1, 2, 3:

(a + d + e + g) + (b + d + f + g) + (c + e + f + g) = 195 + 367 + 562

Left side: a + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f + 3g

Right side: 195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124? Wait, no: 195 + 367 is 562, plus 562 is 1124.

Wait, 195 + 367 = 562? Wait, 195 + 367: 195 + 300 is 495, plus 67 is 562. Yes. Then 562 + 562 is 1124.

So, the sum is 1124.

So, left side: (a + b + c) + 2*(d + e + f) + 3g = 1124

We know that a + b + c = 437, and d + e + f = 234.

So, substituting:

437 + 2*(234) + 3g = 1124

Compute 2*234: 468

So, 437 + 468 = 905

Then, 905 + 3g = 1124

Subtract 905 from both sides: 3g = 1124 - 905 = 219

So, 3g = 219 → g = 73.

So, the number of residents who own all four things is 73.

Wait, let me verify that. So, 

---------------

3g = 219 → g = 73. 

Then, from x + g = 229, x = 229 -73 = 156.

So, 156 people own only C, and 73 own all four.

Does this make sense? Let me check the equations.

We can plug

---------------

 g =73 into the three initial equations.

Equation 1: a + d + e +73 = 195 → a + d + e = 122

Equation 2: b + d + f +73 =367 → b + d + f =294

Equation3: c + e + f +73=562 → c + e + f=489

We also know that d + e + f =234.

So, from equation 2: b + (d + e + f) =294 → b + 234 =294 → b=60.

From equation 1: a + (d + e) =122. But d + e =234 - f.

Hmm, perhaps it

---------------

's getting too detailed, but since the calculations led us to g=73, which seems consistent, I think that's the answer.


To solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and analyze the given data step by step.

We denote:
- \( |D| = 195 \) (diamond ring owners),
- \( |G| = 367 \) (golf clubs owners),
- \( |S| = 562 \) (garden spade owners),
- \( |C| = 900 \) (candy hearts owners, universal set),
- 437 residents own exactly two of the four items,
- 234 residents own exactly three of the four items.

Let:
- \( a, b, c \) be the number of residents owning exactly two items (including candy hearts),
- \( d, e, f \) be the number owning exactly three items (including candy hearts),
- \( g \) be the number owning all four items.

From the problem, we have:
- \( a + b + c = 437 \),
- \( d + e + f = 234 \).

The total number of residents is:
\[ x + 437 + 234 + g = 900 \]
where \( x \) is the number of residents owning only candy hearts. Simplifying:
\[ x + g = 229 \]

Using the inclusion-exclusion principle for \( |D|, |G|, |S| \), we write:
\[ |D| + |G| + |S| = (a + d + e + g) + (b + d + f + g) + (c + e + f + g) \]
\[ 195 + 367 + 562 = (a + b + c) + 2(d + e + f) + 3g \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ 1124 = 437 + 2(234) + 3g \]
\[ 1124 = 437 + 468 + 3g \]
\[ 1124 = 905 + 3g \]
\[ 3g = 219 \]
\[ g = 73 \]

Thus, the number of residents owning all four items is \( \boxed{73} \).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
