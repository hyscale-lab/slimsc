Okay, so I've got this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, have a length of 16, and they change direction exactly four times. Hmm, I need to figure out how to approach this.

First, let me make sure I understand the grid. An 8x8 grid means there are 8 squares along each side, so the number of points (vertices) would be 9 along each row and column. So, moving from the lower left to the upper right would require moving 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. That makes sense because each step is either right or up, so the path is a sequence of these moves.

Now, the problem says the path changes direction exactly four times. Let

---------------

 me think about what that means. Each time the path changes direction, it switches from moving right to up or from up to right. So, the number of direction changes is one less than the number of segments in the path. Wait, no, actually, each segment is a straight line either right or up. So, the number of direction changes is equal to the number of times the path switches from right to up or up to right. So, if a path has k segments, then the number of direction changes is k-1.

Wait, let

---------------

 me clarify. Suppose the path has n segments. Then, the number of direction changes is n-1. Because each change happens between two segments. So, for example, if you have a path that goes right, right, up, up, right, that's 5 segments with 4 direction changes. So, yes

---------------

, direction changes are one less than the number of segments.

But in this problem, the path changes direction exactly four times. So, that means the path has 5 segments. Because direction changes = segments -1. So, 4 direction changes =

---------------

 5 segments.

Wait, but each segment is either right or up. So, the path consists of 5 segments, each either right or up. But the total number of right moves is 8, and the total number of up moves is 8.

So, the

---------------

 path is a sequence of 5 segments, each either right or up, with the total right steps being 8 and up steps being 8. But wait, that can't be right because 5 segments can't sum to 16 steps. Wait, wait, no, each segment is a straight line of multiple steps. So, each segment is a consecutive set of right or up moves.

Oh, right! So, each segment is a straight line, either all right or all up, and the length of each segment can vary. So, for example, a segment could be 1 step right, or 2 steps right, etc., up to 8 steps right. Similarly for up segments.

So, the problem is about partitioning the 8 right steps and 8 up steps into 5 segments, with each segment being entirely right or entirely up. And

---------------

 the number of direction changes is exactly 4, which implies 5 segments.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, if I have a path with k segments, the number of direction changes is k-1. So, if the number of direction changes is 4, then the number of segments is 5. So, the path consists of 5 segments, each either right or up, and the sum of the right segments is 8, and the sum of the up segments is 8.

So, the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to partition the 8 right moves into some number of segments and the 8 up moves into some number of segments, such that the total number of segments is 5. Because each change of direction adds a new segment. So, the total number of segments is 5, which is

---------------

 the number of direction changes plus 1.

Wait, but the direction changes happen between segments. So, if I have 5 segments, the

---------------

 number of direction changes is 4. So, yes, that's correct.

So, the problem becomes: how many ways can we partition the 8 right steps into m segments and the 8 up steps into n segments, such that m + n = 5. Because each segment is either right or up. So, the total number of segments is m + n, which is equal to 5.

Wait, but each right segment is a consecutive number of right steps, and similarly for up segments. So, the number of ways to split the 8 right steps into m segments is equal to the number of compositions of 8 into m parts, which is C(8-1, m-1) = C(7, m-1). Similarly, the number of ways to split the 8 up steps into n segments is C(7, n-1).

But since m + n =5, and both m and n are at least 1, because each path must have at least one right and one up segment. So, m can range from 1 to 4, because if m=1, then n=4; if m=2, n=3; m=3, n=2; m=4, n=1.

So, the total number of paths is the sum over m=1 to 4 of [C(7, m-1) * C(7, n-1)] where n=5 - m.

So, let's compute each term:

1. m=1, n=4:
   C(7,0) * C(7,3) = 1 * 35 = 35

2. m=2, n=3:
   C(7,1) * C(7,2) = 7 * 21 = 147

3. m=3, n=2:
   C(7,2) * C(7,1) = 21 * 7 = 147

4. m=4, n=1:
   C(7,3) * C(7,0) = 35 * 1 = 35

Adding them up: 35 + 147 + 147 + 35 = 364.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So, the total number of such paths is 364.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's double-check the reasoning.

Each path is a sequence of 5 segments, each either right or up. The number of right segments is m, and the number of up segments is n, with m + n =5. For each m from 1 to 4, the number of ways to split the 8 right steps into m segments is C(7, m-1), and similarly for the up steps into n segments as C(7, n-1). Then, multiply these for each m and sum over m.

Yes, that seems right. So, for each m, the number is C(7, m-1)*C(7, 4 - (m-1))? Wait, no, because n=5 - m, so n-1=4 - m. Wait, no

---------------

, n=5 - m, so n-1=4 - m? Wait, no, 5 - m -1 =4 -m. So, yes, C

---------------

(7, m-1) * C(7, (5 -m) -1) = C(7, m-1)*C(7,4 -m). But for

---------------

 m=1, 4 -1=3; for m=2, 4-2=2; m=3, 4-3=1; m=4, 4-4=0. So that's correct.

So, the sum

---------------

 is:

For m=1: C(7,0)*C(7,3)=1*35=35

m=2: C(7,1)*C(7,2)=7*21=147

m=3: C(7,2)*C(7,1)=21*7=147

m=4: C(7,3)*C(7,0)=35*1=35

Total: 35+147+147+35= 364.

Wait, but is

---------------

 there another way to think about this? Let's see.

Alternatively, the number of such paths is equal to the number of ways to interleave the right and up segments. Since we have 5 segments in total, with m right segments and n=5 -m up segments. For each possible m, the number of ways is C(5, m) multiplied by the number of ways to split the right steps into m segments and the up steps into n segments.

Wait, but that

---------------

's not exactly the case. Because the segments are ordered. The path alternates between right and up segments, starting with either right or up. So, the number of such interleavings would be 2 possibilities: starting with right or starting with up, but only if m and n are both

---------------

 at least 1.

Wait, hold on. Let me think. If the path starts with a right segment, then the sequence of segments would be R, U, R, U, ... etc., depending on the number of segments. Similarly, if it starts with U, it's U, R, U, R, etc.

But in our case, m and n can vary. So, for each m from 1 to 4, the number of sequences

---------------

 where the number of right segments is m and up segments is n=5 -m, is equal to 2 possibilities only when both m and n are at least 1. Wait, no. Let me see.

Wait, no. The number of ways to arrange m right segments and n up segments in a sequence is equal to the number of ways to alternate them. If the path starts with right, then the pattern is R, U, R, U,..., ending with either R or U depending on whether m > n or n > m. Similarly, if it starts with U.

But in our case, m + n =5, and m and n can vary.

Wait, maybe I

---------------

 should think of it as the number of ways to interleave m right segments and n up segments, which is C(m + n, m) = C(5, m). But wait

---------------

, no, because the segments are of variable lengths, but their order is determined by the direction changes.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let me think again.

Earlier, I considered that for each m, the number of ways is C(7, m-1) * C(7, n-1), where n=5 -m, and then multiplied by the number of ways to arrange the segments. Wait, but actually

---------------

, in the initial approach, I didn't account for the order of the segments. Because the segments are arranged in a specific order, either starting with R or U.

Wait, so

---------------

 perhaps each path corresponds to a specific arrangement of right and up segments. So, for each m (number of right segments) and n=5 -m (number of up segments), the number of sequences is equal to the number of ways to arrange m R's and n U's, which is C(m + n, m) = C(5, m). But for

---------------

 each such arrangement, we have to count the number of ways to split the steps into segments.

Wait, so perhaps the total number is the sum over m=1 to 4 of [C(5, m) * C(7, m -1) * C(7, n -1)] where n=5 - m.

Wait, but in my initial approach, I didn't include the C(5, m) factor because I assumed that for each m, the number of arrangements is already accounted for in the multiplication

---------------

 of the compositions. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps each composition corresponds to a specific arrangement. For example, if I have m right segments and n up segments, the number of ways to arrange them is the number of interleavings, which is C(m + n, m). But each interleaving corresponds to a different path.

Wait, so perhaps the correct formula is:

Total paths = sum over m=1 to 4 of [C(5, m) * C(7, m -1) * C(7, n -1)] where n=5 -m.

Wait, let's compute that.

For m=1:

C(5,1)=5

C(7,0)=1

C(7,4-1)=C(7,3)=35

So term is 5 *1 *35=175

For m=2:

C(5,2)=10

C(7,1)=7

C(7,2)=21

Term: 10*7*21= 1470

Wait, that's way too big. Hmm

---------------

, that can't be right because the total number of paths from (0,0) to (8,8) is C(16,8)=12870, which is much larger than 364, but 364 is the number of paths with exactly four direction changes.

Wait, but 175 + 1470 + ...?

---------------

 That would be way too big. So, I must have made a mistake in including the C(5, m) factor.

Wait, perhaps the C(5, m) is not needed because when you choose the compositions for right and up segments, the order is already determined by the direction

---------------

 changes. So, perhaps the initial approach is correct without the C(5, m) factor.

Wait, let's think of an example. Suppose m=2, n=3. So, number of right segments is 2, up segments is 3. The number of ways to arrange these segments is equal to the number of ways to interleave R and U segments, which is C(5,2)=10. For each such arrangement, the number of ways to split the 8 right steps into 2 segments is C(7,1)=7, and similarly for up steps into 3 segments is C(7,2)=21. So, for each arrangement, the number of paths is 7 *21=147. Then, since there are 10 arrangements, the total is 10*147=1470. But that can't be, because earlier

---------------

 without the 10, it was 147.

Wait, this suggests that the initial approach was incorrect. Because,

---------------

 in reality, each arrangement of R and U segments (like RURUR, RURRU, etc.) is a different path, and for each arrangement, you have to multiply by the number of ways to split the steps into the respective segments.

But that would mean that the initial approach missed the C(5, m) factor. So, perhaps the correct formula is sum over m=1 to 4 of [C(5, m) * C(7, m-1) * C(7, n-1)] where n=5 -m.

But then, as

---------------

 I saw, for m=1, it's 5 *1 *35=175

For m=2, 10 *7 *21=1470

For m=3, 10 *21 *7=1470

For m=4,5 *35 *1=175

Adding these up: 175 + 1470 + 1470 +175= 3290.

But that's 3290, which is much larger than the initial 364. But this

---------------

 seems contradictory.

Wait, maybe I'm overcounting because some arrangements are not possible. For example, if a path starts with R, then the sequence of segments must alternate R and U. So, for m=2 and n=3, the number of arrangements is C(5,2)=10, but some of these arrangements might not alternate correctly.

Wait, no, because m=2 and n=3, the arrangement must start with R and end with U, since m=2 < n=3. Similarly, starting with U would require m=3 and n=2. So, perhaps the number of valid arrangements is not C(5, m), but something else.

Wait, maybe the number of valid arrangements is equal to 2 if m = n, else 1 if m ≠ n. Because if m ≠n, then the path must start with the larger segment. For example, if m=2 and n=3, then the path must start with U, because otherwise you can't have 3 U segments and 2 R segments.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let's think: if m=2 and n=3, the path must start with U because otherwise you can't have 3 U segments if

---------------

 you start with R. Because starting with R would require alternating, so the segments would be R, U, R, U, U, but that's only 5 segments, but we

---------------

 have 3 U segments and 2 R segments. Wait, no, the arrangement would be R, U, R, U, U? That's 5 segments, but that would require the last two segments to be U, which is allowed. Wait, but starting

---------------

 with R, you have R, U, R, U, U: that's 2 R's and 3 U's, but the last

---------------

 segment is U, which is fine.

Wait, but wait, in this case, m=2, n=3, so starting with R, the sequence would be R, U, R, U, U. That's 5 segments, 2 R's and 3 U's. Similarly, starting with U, it would be U, R, U, R, U. So, both are possible. So, for m=2, n=3, there are two possible arrangements: starting with R or starting with U.

Wait, no, that can't be because if you start with R, you have R, U, R, U, U. But that requires that after the second R, you have two U's left, but the segments

---------------

 must be alternating until the end. Wait, no, actually, the segments can be any order as long as they alternate. So, for m=2, n=3, the number of possible arrangements is C(5,2)=10, but only

---------------

 those that alternate correctly are valid.

Wait, no, because in a path, once you choose to start with R, the segments must alternate R, U, R, U, etc., depending on the number of segments. So, for m=2, n=3, starting with R, the sequence would be R, U, R, U, U. But that's not a

---------------

 valid alternation because after the second R, you have two U's, but you can only have one U segment after each R. So, that

---------------

's not allowed.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because each segment is a single direction, but can consist of multiple steps. So, the segments are R, U, R, U, U. Wait, but that would be R (some steps), then U (some steps), then R (some steps), then U (some steps), then U (some steps). But that's not allowed because you can't have two U segments in a row. Wait, no, because

---------------

 each segment is a consecutive set of steps in one direction. So, the segments must alternate between R and U. So, if you start with R, the next segment must be U, then R, then U, then R, etc. So, for m=2 and n=3, starting with R would require the sequence R, U, R, U, U, but that's not possible because after the second R, you can't have two U segments. So, that's invalid.

Wait, so for

---------------

 m=2 and n=3, the only valid arrangement is starting with U. Because starting with U, the sequence would be U, R, U, R, U, which is 3 U's and 2 R's, and alternates correctly. So, in that case, the number of valid arrangements is 1.

Similarly, for m=3 and n=2, the only valid arrangement is starting with R, giving R, U, R, U, R.

Wait, so in general, for m ≠ n, the number of valid arrangements is 1. For m =n, it's 2, because you can start with R or U.

Wait, but in our case, m and n are such that m + n =5, which is odd. So, m and n cannot be equal, because 5 is odd. So, m and n are always different. Therefore, for each m from 1 to 4, the number of valid arrangements is 1.

Wait, but that contradicts the earlier thought where I thought maybe

---------------

 you could start with R or U, but perhaps not. Let me think again.

If m=2, n=3, then the path must start with U, because starting with R would require ending with U, but the

---------------

 number of U segments would have to be one more than R segments, which is possible. Wait, no, because if you start with R, the sequence would be R, U, R, U, U, but that's two R's and three U's, but the last segment is U, which is allowed. Wait, but the

---------------

 segments must alternate. So, after R, you have U, then R, then U, then U. But the last two segments are both U, which is not allowed because you can't have two U segments in a row. So, that's invalid. Therefore, starting with R is invalid for m=2, n=3, because it would require two U segments in a row.

Similarly, starting with U, the sequence is U, R, U, R, U, which is valid because each segment alternates.

So, in that case, for m=2, n=3, the only valid arrangement is starting with U, so the number of arrangements is 1.

Similarly, for m=3, n=2, the only valid arrangement is starting with R, so number of arrangements is 1.

For m=1, n=4: the arrangement must start with U, because starting with R would require 4 U segments, but starting

---------------

 with U, the sequence is U, R, U, R, U, R, U, which is 4 U's and 1 R. Wait, but m=1, n=4, so the number of segments is 5. So, starting with U, the sequence would be U, R, U, R, U, which is 3 U's and 2 R's, but n=4 and m=1. Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's clarify. For m=1, n=4, the path must have 1 R segment and 4 U segments. So, the arrangement must start with U, because starting with R would require the sequence R, U, R, U, R, U, R, U, which is 4 U's and 4 R's, but that's 8 segments, which is more than 5. Wait, no, because

---------------

 m=1, n=4, the number of segments is 5. So, starting with U, the sequence would be U, R, U, R, U, but that's 3 U's and 2 R's, which doesn't match m=1, n=4.

Wait, maybe I'm not thinking correctly. Let me think of it as the number of segments. For m=1, n=4, the path must have 1 R segment and 4 U segments, totaling 5 segments. So, the arrangement must be U, R, U, U, U. But that's invalid because after R, you can't have three U's in a row. Wait, no, because each segment is a single direction, so the arrangement would be U, R, U, U, U. But that's not allowed because after R, you can only have one U segment. So, you can't have multiple U segments in a row.

Wait, so perhaps for m=1, n=4, it's impossible to arrange the segments because you can't have four U segments separated

---------------

 by R segments when you only have one R segment. Because starting with U, the sequence would be U, R, U, U, U, but that's invalid. Alternatively, starting with R, the sequence would be R, U, U, U, U, which is also invalid because after R, you can't have four U segments in a row. So, that's impossible.

Wait, that can't be right because the problem statement says there are examples shown. So, perhaps my reasoning is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the definition of direction changes. Maybe the direction changes happen

---------------

 between segments, but each segment can consist of multiple steps. So, for example, a path could have a long right segment, then a long up segment, etc.

Wait, but in that case, for m=1, n=4, the path would consist of 1 right segment and 4 up segments, so

---------------

 the arrangement would have to alternate between R and U, starting with R or U. But since m=1 and n=4, the arrangement would have to start with U, because otherwise, after the R segment, you'd have to have a U segment, then another R segment, but m=1, so you can't have another R. So, starting with R would require the sequence R, U, R, U, R, U, R, U, which is 4 U's and 4 R's, but that's 8 segments, which is more than 5. So, that's not possible.

Alternatively, starting with U, the sequence would be U, R, U, R, U, R, U, R, which is 4 U's and 4 R's, again 8 segments. So, that's not possible either.

Wait, so perhaps for m=1, n=4, it's impossible to arrange the segments without having two U segments in a row. Therefore, such paths don't exist. Similarly, for m=4, n=1, it's impossible to arrange the segments without having two R segments in a row. Therefore, the only valid m are 2 and 3, where m=2 and n=3, and m=3 and n=2.

Wait, that makes sense because if you have m=2 and n=3, you can arrange the segments as U, R, U, R, U, which is 3 U's and 2 R's, and

---------------

 no two same segments in a row. Similarly, for m=3 and n=2, you can arrange as R, U, R, U, R.

So, that means for m=1 and m=4, there are zero valid paths because you can't arrange the segments without having two same segments in a row. Therefore, the only valid terms are m=2 and m=3.

So, let's recalculate:

For m=2, n=3:

Number of arrangements: 1 (starting with U)

Number of ways to split right steps into 2 segments: C(7,1)=7

Number of ways to split up steps into 3 segments: C(7,2)=21

Total for m=2: 1 *7 *21=147

For m=3, n=2:

Number of arrangements:1 (starting with R)

Number of ways to split right steps into 3 segments: C(7,2)=21

Number of ways to split up steps into 2 segments: C(7,1)=7

Total for m=3:1 *21 *7=147

So, total paths:147 +147=294.

Wait, that's different from the initial 364. So, which one is correct?

Wait, but

---------------

 earlier I thought that for m=1 and m=4, there are zero paths because you can't arrange the segments without having two same segments in a row. So, perhaps the correct answer is 294.

But let's think again. If

---------------

 m=1, n=4, is there a valid arrangement?

Wait, perhaps not. Because to have 4 U segments and 1 R segment, the arrangement would have to be U, R, U, U, U, which is invalid because after R, you can't have multiple U's in a row. Similarly, starting with R would require R, U, U, U, U, which is also invalid.

So, m=1 and m=4 contribute zero paths. Therefore, the total is 147 +147=294.

But wait, earlier

---------------

 I thought that the initial approach without considering the arrangement was correct, giving 364. But now, considering the arrangement, it's 294.

Which one is correct?

Let me take a small example to test.

Suppose we have a 2x2 grid, and we want paths from (0,0) to (2,2) that change direction exactly 2 times. So, number of segments is 3.

So, m + n =3.

Possible m=1, n=2 and m=2, n=1.

But for m=1, n=2: can we arrange 1 R and 2 U segments without having two U's in a row?

Starting with U: U, R, U. That's valid.

Starting with R: R, U, U. Invalid.

So, only one arrangement for m=1, n=2.

Similarly, for m=2, n=1: starting with R, R, U: invalid. Starting with U: U, R, R: invalid. Wait, no, for

---------------

 m=2, n=1, the arrangement must be R, U, R. Starting with R: R, U, R. That's valid. Starting with U: U, R, R, which is invalid.

So, for m=2, n=1: only one arrangement.

So, total paths:

For m=1, n=2: 1 arrangement.

Number of ways to split R into 1 segment:1

U into 2 segments: C(1,1)=1

So, total for m=1:1 *1 *1=1

Similarly, for m=2, n=1:

1 arrangement.

R into 2 segments: C(1,1)=1

U into 1 segment:1

Total:1 *1 *1=1

So, total paths:1 +1=2.

But what are the actual paths?

From (0,0) to (2,2):

1. Right, Right, Up, Up: but that's two direction changes (after first Right, then after second Right to Up). Wait, no, that's two direction changes. So, path is RRUU: changes direction once from R to U.

Wait, no, wait: RRUU is two direction changes: after first R, then after second R to U, but that's only one direction change. Wait, no, R

---------------

RUU: the first two are R, then the next two are U. So, direction changes once, from R to U.

Wait, but we wanted paths that change direction exactly two times.

So, in a 2x2 grid, how many paths change direction exactly two times?

Each path must have three segments.

Possible paths:

1. Right, Up, Right, Up: RURU

Wait, but that's four segments, which would change direction three times.

Wait, wait, no: from (0,0), R to (1,0), then U to (1,1), then R to (2,1), then U to (2,2). That's four segments, three direction changes.

But we wanted two direction changes, so three segments.

So, possible paths with three segments:

1. RRUU: two segments, direction change once.

Wait, no, that's two segments, one direction change.

Wait, I

---------------

'm getting confused.

Wait, the number of direction changes is equal to the number of segments minus one. So, for three segments, direction changes are two.

So, in a 2x2 grid, how many paths have exactly two direction changes, i.e., three segments.

Each path must have three segments, alternating between R and U.

So, starting with R: R, U, R. The lengths of R segments sum to 2, and U segments sum to 2.

Number of ways to split R into 2 segments: C(1,1)=1 (since 2=1+1)

Similarly, U into 1 segment:1

So, number of such paths:1 *1=1

Similarly, starting with U: U, R, U

Number of ways:1 *1=1

So, total paths:2.

Which matches our earlier calculation. So, the formula works.

So, applying the same logic to the 8x8 grid, we find that for m=2 and m=3, the number of valid arrangements is 1 each, and for m=1 and m=4, it's zero.

Therefore, the total number of paths is 147 +147=294.

Wait, but earlier when I didn't consider the arrangements, I got 364, but that must have been incorrect because it included impossible arrangements where two same segments are adjacent.

Therefore, the correct answer should be 294.

Wait, but let me check another example to be sure.

Take a 1x1 grid, from (0,0) to (1,1). How many paths change direction exactly once? That would be two segments, so direction changes once.

Possible paths:

1. Right, Up

2. Up, Right

Each has one direction change.

So, number of such paths is 2.

Using our formula:

m + n =2.

Possible m=1, n=1.

Number of arrangements:2 (starting with R or U)

Number of ways to split R into 1 segment:1

U into 1 segment:1

Total:2 *1 *1=2, which matches.

Another example: 3x3 grid, paths with exactly two direction changes (three segments).

So, m +n=3.

Possible m=1, n=2; m=2, n=1.

For m=1, n=2:

Number of arrangements:1 (starting with U)

Number of ways: C(2,0)*C(2,1)=1 *2=2

For m=2, n=1:

Number of arrangements:1 (starting with R)

Number of ways: C(2,1)*C(2,0)=2 *1=2

Total paths:2 +2=4.

But let's count manually.

From (0,0) to (3,3), with three segments.

Possible paths:

1. U, R, U

   U steps

---------------

: split into 2 segments, e.g., 1 and 2.

   R steps: split into 1 segment, 3.

   So, number of such paths: C(2,1) (for U splits) * C(2,0) (for R splits) =2 *1=2.

2. R, U, R

   R steps: split into 2 segments, e.g.,1 and 2.

   U steps: split into 1 segment,3.

   Number of such paths: C(2,1)*C(2,0)=2 *1=2.

So, total paths:4, which matches the formula.

Therefore, the formula works.

So, returning to the original problem, the correct total number of paths is 147 +147=294.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 364, but that was without considering the arrangement, leading to overcounting. So, the correct answer should be 294.

But wait, let me think again. In

---------------

 the 2x2 grid example, the formula gave the correct result. So, in the 8x8 grid, the formula gives 294.

But let me check the initial approach again. The initial approach considered all possible m from 1 to4, without considering whether the arrangement is possible, leading to 364. But in

---------------

 reality, only m=2 and m=3 are possible, leading to 294.

Therefore, the correct answer is 294.


To solve the problem of counting the number of paths from the lower left corner to the upper right corner of an 8×8 grid that change direction exactly four times, we analyze the structure of such paths.

Each path consists of 16 steps (8 right and 8 up), divided into segments where each segment is a consecutive sequence of right or up moves. A direction change occurs when the path switches from right to up or up to right. With exactly four direction changes, the path is divided into 5 segments.

To count the valid paths:
1. **Segments and Direction Changes**: With four direction changes, there are 5 segments. These segments alternate between right (R) and up (U) moves.
2. **Valid Segment Arrangements**: For the path to alternate correctly without consecutive same-direction segments, the number of right segments (m) and up segments (n) must satisfy m + n = 5. However, m and n cannot be equal because 5 is odd. Thus, m and n must differ by 1.
3. **Possible m and n Values**: The valid pairs are (m=2, n=3) and (m=3, n=2). For each pair:
   - **For m=2, n=3**: The path must start with an up segment (U, R, U, R, U).
   - **For m=3, n=2**: The path must start with a right segment (R, U, R, U, R).
4. **Counting Paths**:
   - **For m=2, n=3**: The number of ways to split 8 right steps into 2 segments is \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \), and the number of ways to split 8 up steps into 3 segments is \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \). Thus, there are \( 7 \times 21 = 147 \) paths.
   - **For m=3, n=2**: Similarly, the number of ways is \( \binom{7}{2} \times \binom{7}{1} = 21 \times 7 = 147 \) paths.
5. **Total Paths**: Adding both cases gives \( 147 + 147 = 294 \) paths.

Thus, the number of such paths is:
