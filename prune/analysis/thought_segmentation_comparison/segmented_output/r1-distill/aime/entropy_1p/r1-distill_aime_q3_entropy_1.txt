Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with tokens. The rules are that they take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's see. Since Alice goes first, Bob is the second player. So for Bob to have a guaranteed win, he must be able to force Alice into a losing position no matter what she does. I think I should model this using game theory concepts, probably by identifying winning and losing positions.

In game theory, a position is a losing position if every move from that position leads to a winning position for the opponent. Conversely, a winning position is one where there's at least one move that leads to a losing position for the opponent.

So let's try to find the pattern of winning (W) and losing (L) positions. Let me start by listing the possible values of n and see if I can find a pattern.

Let's consider

---------------

 small values of n:

n=1: Alice takes 1 and wins. So Bob can't win here. So n=1 is a losing position for Bob.

n=2: Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. Wait, no—if Alice takes 1, then Bob is faced with n=1, which he can take and win. Wait, but that would mean Bob wins when n=2. Wait, no—wait, n

---------------

=2: Alice's options are to take 1 or 4. But since 4 is larger than 2, she can only take 1. So she takes 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who takes it and wins. Wait, so Bob

---------------

 can win when n=2? Wait, but n=2: Alice takes 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who takes it and wins. So Alice

---------------

 loses because Bob took the last token. So n=2 is a winning position for Bob? No, wait, Alice is going first. If Alice takes 1 from n=2, she leaves n=1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. So Alice

---------------

 would lose if she takes 1. But wait, can she take 4? No, because 4 > 2, so she can't. So she has to take 1. So Bob can win when n=2. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win.

Wait, perhaps I should model

---------------

 this as for each n, if the current player can force a win, it's a W; else, it's an L.

Let me try to list

---------------

 n from 0 upwards:

n=0: Well, that's a terminal position; no tokens left, so the player who just moved wins. So if it's your turn and n=0, you lose because you can't move. So n=0 is a losing position.

n=1: You can take 1, leaving 0 for the opponent, who loses. So n=1 is a W.

n=2: You can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, which is a W for them. So if you leave them at a W, they can win. So is there another option? Taking 4 is not possible. So you

---------------

 can only take 1. So if you take 1, opponent is at n=1 (W), which means opponent can win. So n=2 is a L? Wait, no, because if you can only make a move that leaves the opponent in a W position, then n=2 is L for you. So if

---------------

 it's your turn at n=2, you lose because whatever you do, the opponent can win.

Wait, but wait

---------------

: When n=2, the current player can only take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, who can then take 1 and win. So the current player at n=2 has no winning moves, so n=2 is a losing position.

n=3: You can take 1, leaving n=2 (which is L for the opponent). So by taking 1, you leave opponent at a losing position. So n=3 is a W.

n=4: You can take 1, leaving n=3 (W) or take 4, leaving n=0 (L). So if you take 4, opponent is at n=0 and loses. So n=4 is a W.

n=5: Let's see. You can take 1, leaving n=4 (W), or take 4, leaving n=1 (W). So all options lead to opponent being at W. So n=5 is L.

Wait, so

---------------

 n=5 is a losing position. So the player whose turn it is at n=5 will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

Wait, let's confirm

---------------

:

At n=5, you can take 1, leaving n=4 (W) for the opponent. Opponent can then take 4, leaving n=0 and win. So yes, if you take 1, opponent can win. Alternatively, you could take 4, leaving n=1, which is W for opponent. They take 1 and win. So yes

---------------

, n=5 is L.

n=6: You can take 1, leaving n=5 (L). So you can force opponent into a losing position. So n=6 is W.

n=7: Take 1, leaving n=6 (W). Or take 4, leaving n=3 (W). So both options leave opponent at W. So n=7 is L?

Wait, wait. Let me think again. If you're at n=7 and take 1, opponent gets n=6 (W), which means opponent can win. If you take 4, opponent gets n=3 (W), which also opponent can win. So n=7 is L.

n=8: Take 1, leaving n=7 (L). So you can leave opponent at L, so n=8 is W.

n=9: Take 1, leaving n=8 (W). Take 4, leaving n=5 (L). So if you take 4, opponent is at L. So n=9 is W.

n=10: Take 1, leaving n=9 (W). Take 4, leaving n=6 (W). So both options leave opponent at W. So n=10 is L.

Wait, so let's list what we have so far:

n | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
   | L W L W W L W L W W L

Hmm, I

---------------

'm seeing a pattern here. Let's see the positions where it's L: n=0,2,5,7,10.

Wait, the differences between these L positions are 2, 3, 2, 3, etc. Let

---------------

 me see: 0 to 2 is +2, 2 to5 is +3, 5 to7 is +2, 7 to10 is +3, and so on. So the pattern alternates between adding 2 and 3.

So the losing positions are at n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20, etc.

If this pattern continues, then the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 mod 5? Wait, let me check. 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20:

---------------

 0 mod 5 is 0, 2 mod5 is 2,5 mod5 is 0,7 mod5 is 2,10 mod5 is 0,12 mod5 is 2,15 mod5 is 0,17 mod5 is 2, etc. So the losing positions are n ≡ 0 or 2 mod5?

Wait, no, because 5 mod5 is 0, 7 mod5 is 2, 10 mod5 is 0, 12 mod5 is 2, etc. So yes, the losing positions are numbers that are 0 or 2 mod5.

Wait, but let me check n=12: according

---------------

 to earlier analysis, n=12 is L. Let's confirm that.

n=12: Can I take 1, leaving n=11 (W), or take 4, leaving n=8 (W). So all moves lead to opponent being at W. So yes, n=12 is L.

n=13: Take 1, leaving n=12 (L). So n=13 is W.

n=14: Take 1, leaving n=13 (W). Take 4, leaving n=10 (L). So by taking 4, opponent is at L. So n=14 is W.

n=15: Take 1, leaving n=14 (W). Take 4, leaving n=11 (W). So both options leave opponent at W. So n=15 is L.

Yes, so the pattern seems to hold. So the losing positions are n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,... which are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo5.

Wait, let me check n=20: take

---------------

 1, leaves 19 (W). Take 4, leaves 16 (W). So n=20 is L.

Yes, so the losing positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

So for Bob to have a winning strategy, the starting position n must be a losing position for Alice, because she goes first. So if n is a losing position, then Bob can win regardless of Alice's moves.

Wait, but wait: if

---------------

 n is a losing position, then the current player (Alice) cannot force a win, so Bob can. So yes, Bob can win when n is a losing position.

So the losing positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5. So how

---------------

 many such numbers are ≤2024?

We need to count numbers ≤2024 where n ≡0 mod5 or n≡2 mod5.

Let's compute how many numbers ≤2024 are congruent to 0 mod5 and how many are congruent to 2 mod5.

First, numbers ≡0 mod5 up to 2024: the largest multiple of 5 ≤2024 is 2020 (since 2020=5×404). So the count is 404 (from 5×1=5 up to 5×404=2020).

Wait, but wait: 0 is included? Wait, n is positive integers, so n=5,10,...2020. So the number of terms is 2020/5=404. So 404 numbers.

Numbers ≡2 mod5 up to 2024: the sequence is 2,7,12,... up to the largest number ≤2024.

What's the largest number ≡2 mod5 ≤2024? Let's compute 2024 mod5: 2024 ÷5 is 404×5=2020, remainder 4. So 2024=5×404 +4. So the last number ≡2 mod5 is 2024 - (4-2)=2024-2=2022. Because 2022=5×404 +2. So the sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022.

How many terms? The first term is 2=5×0 +2, the last term is 2022=5×404 +2. So the number of terms is 405 (since it starts at 0:

---------------

 0,1,2,...404 → 405 terms).

Wait, let me check: 2022=5k+2 → 5k=2020 →k=404. So the terms are 2+5m where m ranges from 0 to 404. So that's 405 terms.

So total losing positions are 404 (for 0 mod5) plus 405 (for 2 mod5) = 809.

Wait, but wait: let

---------------

 me confirm whether 0 is included. But in our problem, n is a positive integer, so n starts from 1. So when n=0, it's not counted. But in our earlier analysis, n=0 is a losing position, but since the game starts with n≥1, we shouldn't include n=0.

So for numbers ≡0 mod5, the numbers are 5,10,15,...,2020. So the count is 2020/5=404.

For numbers ≡2 mod5, the numbers are 2,7,12,...,2022. The count is (2022-2)/5 +1 = (2020)/5 +1=404+1=405.

So total losing positions are 404 +405=809.

Wait, but let me check if

---------------

 2022 is indeed ≤2024. Yes, it's 2022. So that's correct.

So the answer should be 809.

Wait, but wait: let me make

---------------

 sure that the pattern holds beyond what I checked earlier. Let me check n=16:

n=16: You

---------------

 can take 1, leaving 15 (L), so n=16 is W.

n=17: Take 1, leaving 16 (W). Take 4, leaving 13 (W). So n=17 is L.

Yes, so the pattern continues. So the losing positions are indeed n≡0 or 2 mod5.

So the number of such n ≤2024 is 404 +405=809.
</think>

To determine the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) for which Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game's winning and losing positions. A losing position is one where every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent. 

By examining small values of \( n \), we identify the losing positions as those where \( n \equiv 0 \) or \( 2 \pmod{5} \). 

- **Count of \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \) up to 2024**: These are 5, 10, 15, ..., 2020. The count is \( \frac{2020}{5} = 404 \).
- **Count of \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \) up to 2024**: These are 2, 7, 12, ..., 2022. The count is \( \frac{2022 - 2}{5} + 1 = 405 \).

Adding these, the total number of losing positions is \( 404 + 405 = 809 \).

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) where Bob can guarantee a win is \(\boxed{809}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
