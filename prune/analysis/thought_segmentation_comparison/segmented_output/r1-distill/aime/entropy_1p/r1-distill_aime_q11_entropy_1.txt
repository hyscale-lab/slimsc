Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. Let me read it again carefully to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is about a 2x3 grid. Each cell in the grid needs to have a digit placed in it. The conditions are that when you read the grid left to right, the two numbers formed should add up to 999. Additionally, when you read the grid top to bottom, the three numbers formed should add up to 99. They gave an example grid that satisfies these conditions, and I need to find how many such arrangements are possible.

Alright, let me break this down. The grid is 2 rows by 3 columns. So, when reading left to right, each row forms a three-digit number. Let's denote the grid as follows:

```
a b c
d e f
```

So, the first number (top row) is 100a + 10b + c. The second number (bottom row) is 100d + 10e + f. Their sum should be 999. So,

(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999.

Also, when reading top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. So, the first column is 10a + d, the second column is 10b + e, and the third column is 10c + f. Their sum should be 99. So,

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

So, I have two equations:

1. (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
2. (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

I think it would help to write these equations in a more manageable form. Let me expand the first equation:

100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

I

---------------

 can group similar terms:

100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

Similarly, for the second equation:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Grouping terms:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Hmm. So now I have two equations:

1. 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.
2. 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

I need to find the number of possible digit assignments (a, b, c, d, e, f) that satisfy both equations. Each of a, b, c, d, e, f is a digit, meaning they can be from 0 to 9, except perhaps a and d, which are the first digits of three-digit and two-digit numbers, respectively. Wait, but in the example, a is 0 and d is 9. So, leading

---------------

 zeros are allowed? Because in the example, the top row is 008, which is 8, and the bottom is 991, which is fine. So, leading zeros are allowed for both the rows and columns. So, a and d can be zero. So, all digits from 0 to 9 are allowed for all cells.

So, that

---------------

's good to know. So, no restrictions on a and d being non-zero.

Now, let me try to manipulate these equations to find relationships between the variables.

Let me denote some variables to simplify:

Let S1 = a + d
S2 = b + e
S3 = c + f

From equation 1:

100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

So, equation 1 is:

100 S1 + 10 S2 + S3 = 999. 

---------------

 (Equation A)

Similarly, from equation 2, let's denote:

T1 = a + b + c
T2 = d + e + f

So equation 2 is:

10 T1 + T2 = 99.  (Equation B)

So now, we have Equation A and Equation B.

But

---------------

 I need to find the number of possible assignments of a, b, c, d, e, f such that both equations are satisfied.

Let me see if I can express some variables in terms of others.

Looking at Equation B: 10 T1 + T2 = 99.

Let

---------------

 me solve for T2: T2 = 99 - 10 T1.

Since T1 and T2 are sums of digits, each T

---------------

1 and T2 must be non-negative integers. Let's see the possible values T1 can take.

Since T1 = a + b + c, and each of a, b, c is between 0 and 9, the minimum T1 is 0 and maximum is 27 (if all are 9). But since

---------------

 10 T1 + T2 = 99, T1 must satisfy 10 T1 ≤ 99, so T1 ≤ 9.9, so T1 can be from 0 to 9.

But T1 is an integer, so T1 can be 0,1,2,...,9.

Similarly, T2 = 99 - 10 T1. Since T2 is the sum of three digits (d + e + f), each of which is between 0 and 9, the minimum T2 is 0 and maximum is 27.

So, 99 - 10 T1 must be between 0 and 27.

So, 99 - 10 T1 ≥ 0 → T1 ≤ 9.9 → T1 ≤9.

And 99 - 10 T1 ≤ 27 → 99 -27 ≤ 10 T1 → 72 ≤ 10 T1 → T1 ≥7.2.

Since T1 is an integer, T1 ≥8.

So T1 can be 8 or 9.

So, T1 can be 8 or 9.

Let me consider each case.

Case 1: T1 =8

Then T2 =99 -10*8=99-80=19.

Case 2: T1=9

Then T2=99 -90=9.

So, we

---------------

 have two cases: T1=8, T2=19; or T1=9, T2=9.

Now, let's go

---------------

 back to Equation A: 100 S1 +10 S2 + S3 =999.

But S1 =a +d, S2 =b +e, S3= c +f.

So

---------------

, S1, S2, S3 are sums of two digits each. So each S can range from 0 to 18.

So

---------------

, 100 S1 +10 S2 + S3 =999.

Let me think about this. The left side is a three-digit number where S1 is the hundreds digit, S2 the tens, and S3 the units. So, 100 S1 +10 S2 + S3 = 999.

So, this implies that:

S1 must be 9, because 999 has 9 in the hundreds place.

So, S1=9.

Then, the equation becomes:

100*9 +10 S2 + S3=999 → 900 +10 S2 + S3=999 → 10 S2 + S3=99.

So, 10 S2 + S3=99.

Now, S2 and S3 are sums of two digits, so each can be from 0 to 18.

So, 10 S2 + S3=99.

Let me solve for possible S2 and S3.

Let me denote

---------------

 that equation as:

10 S2 + S3 =99.

We can write this as:

S3=99 -10 S2.

Since S3 must be between 0 and 18, let's see the possible values of S2.

9

---------------

9 -10 S2 ≥0 → 10 S2 ≤99 → S2 ≤9.9 → S2 ≤9.

Also, 99 -10 S2 ≤18 → 99-18 ≤10 S2 →81 ≤10 S2 → S2 ≥8.1 → S2 ≥9.

So, S2 must be exactly 9.

So, S2=9, then S3=99-90=9.

So, S2=9, S3=9.

So, in Equation A, we have S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.

So, summar

---------------

izing, from Equation A, S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.

So, now we have:

From the grid:

S1 = a + d =9

S2 = b + e=9

S3 =c +f=9

So, each pair of variables in a column sums to 9.

So, each pair (a,d), (b,e), (c,f) must add up to 9.

So

---------------

, this is interesting. So, each column in the grid sums to 9.

Wait, but wait. Because each column is read as a two-digit number. So, for example, the first column is 10a + d. But a

---------------

 + d =9, but 10a + d can be anything from 0 to 99, depending on a and d.

Wait, but we

---------------

 have that a + d=9, but 10a + d is a two-digit number. Wait, but a

---------------

 can be zero. So, for example, if a=0, d=9, then the column number is 09, which is 9. Similarly, if a=5, d=4, the column number is 54.

So, each column's two-digit number can vary based on a and d, but their sum is 9.

But from

---------------

 Equation B, which is 10 T1 + T2=99, and T1 is a +b +c, T2 is d +e +f.

But since S1=9, S2=9, S3=9, T

---------------

2 = d + e + f = (d + e + f)= (9 - a) + (9 - b) + (9 - c) = 27 - (a + b + c) =27 - T1.

So, T2=27 - T1.

But from Equation B, T2=99 -10 T1.

So,

27 - T1 =99 -10 T1 → 27 - T1 =99 -10 T1 → 9 T1=72 → T1=8.

So, T1=8.

Thus, from earlier, T1 can be 8 or 9, but in this case, it must be 8 because T

---------------

2=27 - T1=19, which fits into our earlier analysis.

Wait, so that means T1 must be 8, which makes

---------------

 T2=19.

So, in this case, T1= a + b + c=8, and T2= d + e + f=19.

But since d=9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c, because a +d=9, etc., then:

d + e + f= (9 -a) + (9 -b) + (9 -c)=27 - (a + b + c)=27 - T1=27 -8=19, which matches.

So, all right

---------------

, so everything is consistent.

So, now, the problem reduces to finding the number of 2x3 grids where each column sums to 9, and the sum of the top row digits (a + b + c) is 8, and the sum of the bottom row digits (d + e + f)=19.

But since d=9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c, and d + e + f=19, as we saw.

So, the

---------------

 key is to find the number of possible triples (a, b, c) such that a + b + c=8, and each of a, b, c is between 0 and 9 (inclusive), and each

---------------

 pair (a, d), (b, e), (c, f) sums to 9, with d=9 -a, etc.

But since each a, b, c is a digit, and

---------------

 d, e, f are determined by a, b, c, the main variables are a, b, c.

So, the number of possible grids is equal to the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8, where each of a, b, c is between 0 and 9, inclusive.

Wait, but since

---------------

 a, b, c are digits, each can be from 0 to 9, and a + b + c=8.

So, the number of solutions is the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8, with 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤9.

Since 8 is less than 3*9=27, and each variable is at most 9, the constraints are automatically satisfied because a, b, c can be at most 8, which is less than 9.

Wait, no, because

---------------

 the maximum any of them can be is 8, since the sum is 8. So, each of a, b, c is ≤8, which is ≤9, so the upper bounds are automatically satisfied.

So, the number of solutions is the same as the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8, which is C(8 + 3 -1, 3 -1)=C(10,2)=45.

But wait, but

---------------

 digits can be zero, so yes, that's correct. So, 45 solutions.

But wait, each solution corresponds to a possible (a, b, c), and for each such solution, d=9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c.

But we need to make sure that d, e, f are digits, i.e., between 0 and 9.

Since a can be up to 8, d=9 -a is at least 1, and since a is at least 0, d is at most 9. So, d is a digit.

Similarly, e and f will be digits as well.

So, all the

---------------

 variables a, b, c, d, e, f are digits.

Therefore, each solution (a, b, c) with a + b + c=8 gives a valid grid.

So, the total number of grids is 45.

Wait, but wait a second.

In the example given, a=0, b=0, c=8. So, a + b + c=8, which fits.

But in that case, d=9-0=9, e=9-0=9, f=9-8=1. So, d + e + f=9+9+1=19, which matches T2=19.

So, that example is one of the 45 possible grids.

But wait, is

---------------

 that all? Because I feel like that's the case, but let me check.

Wait, but perhaps there are constraints I'm missing.

Wait, the

---------------

 top row is 100a +10b +c, which is a three-digit number, but a can be zero, so it's effectively a three-digit number with leading zeros allowed. Similarly for the bottom row.

So, all

---------------

 grids are allowed as long as the digits sum correctly.

So, yes, the number of solutions is 45.

Wait, but wait, is

---------------

 that correct? Let me think again.

Wait, 45 is the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8. But each of a, b, c can be 0 to 8, inclusive

---------------

, so yes, 45.

But let me think if any of the digits a, b, c can be more than 9? No, because 8 is the maximum any can be, which is less than 9.

So, all 45 solutions are valid.

So, the total number of such grids is 45.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think if there

---------------

 are other constraints.

Wait, when I look at the first equation, 100 S1 +10 S2 + S3=999, and we found S1=S2=S3=9.

So, each column sum is 9.

So, each column is

---------------

 a two-digit number where the digits sum to 9.

But in the example, the first column is 09, which is 9, the second is 09, and the third is 81, which are all two-digit numbers where digits sum to 9.

So, that's correct.

So, each column is a two-digit number (possibly with leading zero) where the digits add to 9.

So, the number

---------------

 of such two-digit numbers is 10: 09, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90.

Wait, wait

---------------

, 10 numbers because for each digit a from 0 to 9, d=9 -a. So, 10 possibilities.

So, for each column, there are 10 possibilities.

But in our case, the columns are determined by a, b, c and d, e, f.

But in our problem, the columns are (

---------------

a, d), (b, e), (c, f), each summing to 9.

So, for each column, the

---------------

 digits sum to 9, so each column can be any of the 10 possibilities.

But in our problem, the variables a, b, c are the

---------------

 top digits, and d, e, f are determined as 9 -a, 9 -b, 9 -c.

So, for each column, the top digit is a variable, and the bottom is determined.

So, in this

---------------

 case, the number of grids is equal to the number of possible a, b, c such that a + b + c=8.

Which is 45.

So, that

---------------

's the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: Each column can be any of the 10 possible two-digit numbers where the digits sum to 9. So, 10 possibilities per column.

So, for three columns, the total number of grids would be 10^3=1000.

But,

---------------

 we have the additional constraint that the sum of the top row digits is 8.

Because T1= a + b + c=8.

So, the

---------------

 number of grids where each column sums to 9, and the top row digits sum to 8.

So, how does that affect the count?

Each

---------------

 column is (x, 9 -x), where x is from 0 to 9.

So, the top digits are a, b, c, which are x1, x2, x3 for the three columns.

So, a =x1, b=x2, c=x3.

And we have x1 +x2 +x3=8.

So, the number of possible (x1, x2, x3) where each xi is between 0 and 9, and their sum is 8.

Which is the same as the number of non-negative integer solutions to x1 +x2 +x3=8, which is C(8 +3 -1, 3-1)=C(10,2)=45.

So, same as before.

So, that's correct.

Therefore, the total number of grids is 45.

But wait, but

---------------

 in the example, a=0, b=0, c=8.

Which is one of the 45.

So, the

---------------

 answer is 45.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure.

Is there any other constraint I'm missing?

Wait

---------------

, the sum of the top row is 8, which is allowed, as digits can be zero.

But let me think if any of the digits in the top row could be greater than 9, but since the sum is 8, each digit is at most 8, which is fine.

So, no issues.

So, yes, the answer is 45.


To solve the problem, we analyze the given conditions. The grid is a 2x3 matrix where the sum of the two three-digit numbers formed by reading each row left to right is 999, and the sum of the three two-digit numbers formed by reading each column top to bottom is 99.

Let the grid be:

```
a b c
d e f
```

From the first condition, the sum of the two three-digit numbers is:
\[
(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999
\]

From the second condition, the sum of the three two-digit numbers is:
\[
(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99
\]

Let \( S_1 = a + d \), \( S_2 = b + e \), \( S_3 = c + f \), and \( T_1 = a + b + c \), \( T_2 = d + e + f \). From the first equation:
\[
100S_1 + 10S_2 + S_3 = 999
\]
From the second equation:
\[
10T_1 + T_2 = 99
\]

From the first equation, \( S_1 = 9 \), \( S_2 = 9 \), and \( S_3 = 9 \) because \( 100 \times 9 + 10 \times 9 + 9 = 999 \). This means each column sums to 9, so \( a + d = 9 \), \( b + e = 9 \), and \( c + f = 9 \).

From the second equation, substituting \( T_2 = 27 - T_1 \) (since \( d + e + f = 27 - (a + b + c) \)):
\[
10T_1 + (27 - T_1) = 99 \implies 9T_1 = 72 \implies T_1 = 8
\]
Thus, \( a + b + c = 8 \).

The problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to \( a + b + c = 8 \), where \( 0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9 \). The number of solutions is given by the stars and bars theorem:
\[
\binom{8 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{10}{2} = 45
\]

Thus, there are **45** valid grids.
