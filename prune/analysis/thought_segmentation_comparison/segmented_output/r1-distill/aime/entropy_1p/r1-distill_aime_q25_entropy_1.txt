Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the parts.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find the length AP, which can be written as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, let's break this down. First, triangle ABC has sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. It's inscribed in a circle, which is the circumcircle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at D. Then, line AD meets the circle again at P.

I think the key here is to use properties of circles, tangents, and power of a point. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, D lies on the symmedian of triangle ABC. Also, the

---------------

 power of point D with respect to ω should be equal to DB² and DC², since DB and DC are tangent lengths from D to ω.

Wait, yes

---------------

, the power of a point D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² because both are tangent lengths from D to the circle. So, DB = DC. Hmm, that suggests that D lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC. That's something to note.

But

---------------

 maybe more importantly, since D is the intersection of tangents at B and C, AD is a line from A through D, intersecting the circle again at P. So, P

---------------

 is the second intersection point of AD with ω. Therefore, AP is a segment from A to P, and we can probably

---------------

 find it using some properties related to power of a point or similar triangles.

Let me recall that when you have a point outside a circle and a secant, the power of the point is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments of the secant. In this case, point D has a power equal to DB², which is equal to DC². Also, since AD is a secant passing through D, intersecting the circle at A and P, the power of D with respect to ω should be equal to DA * DP.

So, the

---------------

 power of point D is DB² = DA * DP.

Therefore, DB² = DA * DP.

If I can find DB, and if I can express DA in terms of AP, then maybe I can solve for AP.

Wait, let me think. Let's denote AP as x. Then, since AD is a line from A to D passing through P, the entire length AD is AP + PD. But wait, no, because D is outside the circle, and A is on the circle, so AD is a secant with

---------------

 A on the circle and P inside? No, actually, P is another intersection point on the circle. So, AD starts at A, goes through D, and intersects the circle again at P. Wait, no, that's not correct. If

---------------

 you have a point D outside the circle, and you draw a line from D through A, which is on the circle, then that line will intersect the circle again at another point P. So, in this case, AP is from A to P, and PD is from P to D. So, the lengths would be AD = AP + PD? Or is it AP = AD - PD?

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. Point

---------------

 D is outside the circle. Point A is on the circle. Line AD starts at D, goes through A, and then intersects the circle again at P. So, the order is D --- A --- P. So, DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is from D to P, which is DA + AP. So, DP = DA + AP. But wait

---------------

, no, because P is beyond A from D's perspective. So, from D to A is DA, then from A to P is AP. So, DP = DA + AP.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because if

---------------

 D is outside the circle and A is on the circle, then the line from D through A would exit the circle at A, and then the other intersection point would be on the opposite side of the circle. Wait, no, that

---------------

's not possible because a line can intersect a circle at most two points. So, if you have D outside, and line DA passes through A (on the circle), then it must intersect the circle again at another point P. So, the points are D --- A --- P, so DP is the entire length from D to P, which is DA + AP.

Wait, no, because A

---------------

 is between D and P. So, if you have D, then moving towards A, which is on the circle, then continuing past A to P, which is another point on the circle. So, the distance from D to A is DA, and from A to P is AP, so the total distance from D to P is DA + AP. So, DP = DA + AP.

But according

---------------

 to the power of point D, we have DB² = DA * DP.

So, substituting DP, we get DB² = DA * (DA + AP).

But we

---------------

're trying to find AP, which is x. Let me denote DA as y. Then, DP = y + x.

So, DB² = y * (y + x).

But I don't know DB or DA yet.

Alternatively, maybe we can find DA in terms of other known quantities.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use coordinates

---------------

 or trigonometry.

Wait, maybe it's better to use coordinate geometry here. Let me try setting up coordinates.

Let me place point C at the origin (0, 0), point A at (10, 0), since AC = 10. Then, point B is somewhere in the plane. We know the lengths AB = 5 and BC = 9.

So, with C at (0, 0), A at (10, 0), let me find coordinates for B.

Let me denote B as (x, y). Then, the distance from B to C is 9, so sqrt(x² + y²) = 9, so x² + y² = 81.

The distance from B to A is 5, so sqrt((x - 10)^2 + y²) = 5, so (x - 10)^2 + y² = 25.

Subtracting the first equation from the second:

(x - 10)^2 + y² - (x² + y²) = 25 - 81

Expanding (x - 10)^2: x² - 20x + 100.

So, x² - 20x + 100 + y² - x² - y² = -56

Simplify: -20x + 100 = -56

So, -20x = -156 → x = 156 / 20 = 39/5 = 7.8.

Then, x = 7.8. Now, plug

---------------

 into x² + y² = 81.

x = 7.8 = 39/5. So, x² = (39/5)^2 = (1521)/(25).

So, y² = 81 - (1521/25) = (2025/25) - (1521/25) = (504)/25.

So, y = sqrt(504/25) = (sqrt(504))/5.

Simplify sqrt(504): 504 = 16 * 31.5, wait, no. 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 16*31 is 496, 16*31.5 is 504.

Wait, 

---------------

504 = 16 * 31.5, but 31.5 is not an integer. Alternatively, factor 504: 504 = 8 * 63 = 8 * 9 * 7 = 8 * 9 *7. So, sqrt(504) = sqrt(8*9*7) = sqrt(8)*sqrt(9)*sqrt(7) = 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14).

So, sqrt(504) = 6*sqrt(14). Therefore, y = 6*sqrt(14)/5.

So, point B has coordinates (7.8, 6√14/5). Let me write that as (39/5, (6√14)/5).

Now, I can find the equation of the circumcircle ω of triangle ABC. Since points A, B, C are on ω, and we have their coordinates, we can find the equation.

But maybe it's better to compute the circumradius and other properties.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find point D, the intersection of the tangents at B and C.

Wait, in coordinate geometry, the tangent at a point on a circle can be found using the equation of the circle.

But first, let's find the equation of the circumcircle ω.

Points A(10,0), B(39/5, 6√14/5), C(0,0).

To find the circumcircle, we can find the perpendicular bisectors of two sides and find their intersection, which is the center O of the circle.

Let me compute the perpendicular bisector of AC and AB.

Wait, AC is from (10,0) to (0,0). The midpoint is (5, 0). The slope of AC is (0-0)/(0-10) = 0, so it's a horizontal line. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector is vertical, x = 5.

Now, let's find the perpendicular bisector of AB.

First, find the midpoint of AB. Point A is (10,0), point B is (39/5, 6√14/5). So, midpoint M is:

x-coordinate: (10 + 39/5)/2 = (50/5 + 39/5)/2 = (89/5)/2 = 89/10 = 8.9.

y-coordinate: (0 + 6√14/5)/2 = (6√14/5)/2 = 3√14/5.

So, M is (89/10, 3√14/5).

Now, the slope of AB is (6√14/5 - 0)/(39/5 - 10) = (6√14/5) / (-11/5) = -6√14/11.

Therefore, the perpendicular bisector will have slope reciprocal and opposite: 11/(6√14).

So, the equation of the perpendicular bisector of AB is:

(y - 3√14/5) = (11/(6√14))(x - 89/10)

We already know that the perpendicular bisector of AC is x = 5. So, to find the center O, we can plug x=5 into the above equation.

So, substitute

---------------

 x =5:

y - 3√14/5 = (11/(6√14))(5 - 89/10)

Compute 5 - 89/10 = 50/10 -89/10 = (-39)/10.

So,

y = 3√14/5 + (11/(6√14))*(-39/10)

Compute the second term:

(11 * (-39)) / (6√14 * 10) = (-429)/(60√14) = (-143)/(20√14)

Simplify:

Multiply numerator and denominator by √14:

(-143√14)/(20*14) = (-143√14)/280.

So,

y = 3√14/5 + (-143√14)/280.

Convert 3√14/5 to denominator 280:

3√14/5 = (3√14 * 56)/280 = 168√14/280.

So,

y = 168√14/280 -143√14/280 = (168√14 -143√14)/280 = (25√14)/280 = (5√14)/56.

Therefore, the center O is at (5, 5√14/56).

Wait, that seems a bit odd. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, when

---------------

 I computed the slope of AB, I had (6√14/5)/(39/5 - 10). 39/5 is 7.8, 10 is 10, so 7.8 -10 = -2.2 = -11/5. So, the slope is (6√14/5)/(-11/5) = -6√14/11. Correct.

So, the perpendicular bisector slope is reciprocal and opposite: 11/(6√14). Correct.

Midpoint M is at (89/10, 3√14/5). Correct.

Then, equation: y - 3√14/5 = (11/(6√14))(x - 89/10). Correct.

When x =5, substitute

---------------

:

y = 3√14/5 + (11/(6√14))(5 - 89/10)

5 is 50/10, so 5 - 89/10 = (50 -89)/10 = (-39)/10. Correct.

So, the term is (11/(6√14))*(-39/10) = (-429)/(60√14). Simplify numerator and denominator:

Divide numerator and denominator by 3: (-143)/(20√14). Correct.

Then, rationalizing the denominator:

(-143√14)/(20*14) = (-143√14)/280. Correct.

So, y = 3√14/5 + (-143√14)/280.

Convert 3√14/5 to denominator 280: 3√14/5 = (3√14 *56)/280 = 168√14/280. Correct.

So, y = (168√14 -143√14)/280 = 25√14/280 = 5√14/56. Correct.

So, center O is at (5, 5√14/56). Hmm, that seems correct.

Now, the radius R of the circumcircle is the distance from O to any of the points A, B, or C. Let's compute OA.

Point A is (10, 0), O is (5, 5√14/56).

Distance OA:

sqrt[(10 -5)^2 + (0 -5√14/56)^2] = sqrt[25 + (25*14)/(56^2)]

Simplify:

25 + (350)/(3136) = 25 + (350 ÷ 14)/(3136 ÷14) = 25 + 25/224.

Wait, 350 ÷14 is 25, and 3136 ÷14 is 224.

So, 25 + 25/224 = (25 * 224 +25)/224 = 25*(224 +1)/224 = 25*225/224.

Wait, that seems complicated, but perhaps it's correct.

Wait, 25 + 25/224 = (25*224 +25)/224 = 25*(224 +1)/224 = 25*225/224.

So, OA = sqrt(25*225/224) = (5 *15)/sqrt(224) = 75 / sqrt(224).

Simplify sqrt(224): 224 = 16*14, so sqrt(224) = 4*sqrt(14).

So, OA = 75/(4√14). Rationalize:

75/(4√14) * (√14/√14) = 75√14/(4*14) = 75√14/56.

So, the radius R is 75√14/56.

Hmm

---------------

, okay.

Now, we need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C.

Wait, in coordinate geometry, the tangent at a point on a circle can be found using the equation:

For a circle with center (h,k) and radius R, the tangent at point (x1,y1) is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y -k) = R².

Wait, no, the equation of the tangent line at (x1, y1) on the circle (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = R^2 is:

(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R^2.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The equation of the tangent line is actually:

(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R^2.

Wait, actually, I think the equation is (x1)(x) + (y1)(y) + ... Hmm, maybe it's better to use the point-form of the tangent.

Alternatively, the equation of the tangent at point (x1, y1) on the circle is:

(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y -k) = R^2.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The standard equation for the tangent at (x1,y1) is:

(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y -k) = R².

Wait, no, that's the equation of the circle itself. Wait, perhaps I should recall that the tangent line at (x1,y1) is perpendicular to the radius vector (x1 - h, y1 - k). So, the slope of the tangent line is -(x1 - h)/(y1 - k), assuming the radius isn't vertical.

Alternatively, using

---------------

 the formula:

The equation of the tangent at (x1,y1) is:

(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y -k) = R².

Wait, but that's the equation of the circle. Hmm, I think I'm confusing something.

Wait, maybe

---------------

 it's better to use the formula for the tangent line at (x1, y1):

For a circle (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = R^2, the tangent at (x1, y1) is:

(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R^2.

Wait, no, that's the equation for the tangent plane in 3D. In 2D, the equation is different.

Wait, no

---------------

, in 2D, the equation is:

(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R^2.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the

---------------

 equation of the tangent line is actually:

(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R^2.

Wait, but that

---------------

 would imply that (x1, y1) lies on the circle, so substituting (x1, y1) into the equation would give R^2 = R^2, which is true, but that's the equation for the circle, not the tangent.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. The equation of the tangent line can be written as:

(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = 0.

Wait, no, that would pass through (x1,y1) but not necessarily tangent.

Wait, maybe I should compute the tangent using the derivative or using the condition that the distance from the center to the line is equal to R.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 it's better to compute the equation of the tangent at point C(0,0). Since C is on the circle, the tangent at C can be found using the fact that it's perpendicular to the radius OC.

The center is O(5, 5√14/56). So, the vector OC is from O to C: (0 -5, 0 -5√14/56) = (-5, -5√14/56).

The slope of OC is ( -5√14/56 ) / (-5) = (√14)/56 * 5/5 = √14/56 * (-5)/(-5) = √14/56 *1 = √14/56 * (5/5) ???

---------------

 Wait, no.

Wait, slope is (y2 - y1)/(x2 -x1). From O(5, 5√14/56) to C(0,0):

Slope = (0 -5√14/56)/(0 -5) = (-5√14/56)/(-5) = (√14)/56 * (5/5) ??? Wait, no.

Wait, (-5√14/56) divided by (-5) is (5√14/56)/5 = √14/(56/5) = √14/(11.2). Hmm, maybe not the best approach.

Alternatively, since the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC, its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of OC.

Slope of OC is (0 -5√14/56)/(0 -5) = (-5√14/56)/(-5) = (√14)/56 * (5/5) = √14/11.2? Wait, let

---------------

 me compute it correctly.

Slope of OC: (0 -5√14/56) / (0 -5) = (-5√14/56)/(-5) = (√14)/56 *5/5 = √14/(56/5) = √14/(11.2). Wait, perhaps

---------------

 better to compute as fractions.

Slope of OC: ( -5√14/56 ) / ( -5 ) = (5√14/56)/5 = √14/56.

So, slope of OC is √14/56.

Therefore, the slope of the tangent at C is the negative reciprocal: -56/√14.

Simplify -56/√14: 56 = 4*14, so 56/√14 = 4√14. So, slope is -4√14.

So, the tangent at C is a line passing through (0,0) with slope -4√14.

Equation: y = -4√14 x.

Similarly, find the tangent at B.

Point B is (39/5, 6√14/5). Let's compute the slope of OB.

Slope of OB: (6√14/5 -5√14/56)/(39/5 -5).

Compute numerator: 6√14/5 -5√14/56 = (6√14 *56 -5√14 *5)/(5*56) = [336√14 -25√14]/280 = (311√14)/280.

Denominator: 39/5 -5 = 39/5 -25/5 =14/5.

So, slope of OB is (311√14/280)/(14/5) = (311√14/280) * (5/14) = (311√14 *5)/(280*14).

Simplify denominator: 280*14 = 3920.

So, slope is (1555√14)/3920.

Simplify numerator and denominator by 5: 1555 ÷5=311, 3920 ÷5=784.

So, slope is 311√14/784.

Therefore, the slope of the tangent at B is the negative reciprocal: -784/(311√14).

Simplify this: Multiply

---------------

 numerator and denominator by √14:

-784√14/(311*14) = -784√14/(4354).

Simplify 784 and 4354: Let's see, 784 ÷14 =56, 4354 ÷14 = 311. So, 784 =14*56, 4354=14*311.

So, -784√14/(4354) = -56√14/311.

So, the slope of the tangent at B is -56√14/311.

Thus, the equation of the tangent at B is:

y - 6√14/5 = (-56√14/311)(x -39/5).

Now, we have two tangent lines: one at C is y = -4√14 x, and the tangent at B is y = (-56√14/311)(x -39/5) +6√14/5.

We need to find their intersection point D.

So, set y = -4√14 x equal to the other equation.

So,

-4√14 x = (-56√14/311)(x -39/5) +6√14/5.

Let me divide both sides by √14 to simplify:

-4x = (-56/311)(x -39/5) +6/5.

Multiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:

-4x *311 = -56(x -39/5) +6/5 *311.

Compute each term:

Left side: -1244x.

Right side: -56x + (56*39)/5 + (6*311)/5.

Compute 56*39: 56*40=2240, minus 56=2184.

So, (56*39)/5 = 2184/5.

Compute 6*311=1866, so 1866/5.

So, right side becomes: -56x + (2184 +1866)/5 = -56x + 4050/5 = -56x + 810.

So, the equation is:

-1244x = -56x +810.

Bring -56x to the left:

-1244x +56x =810 → -1188x =810.

Solve for x:

x = 810 / (-1188) = -810/1188.

Simplify the fraction:

Divide numerator and denominator by 9: -90/132.

Again by 6: -15/22.

So, x= -15/22.

Now, substitute back into y = -4√14 x:

y = -4√14*(-15/22) = (60√14)/22 = (30√14)/11.

So, point D is at (-15/22, 30√14/11).

Now, we have point A at (10,0) and point D at (-15/22, 30√14/11). We need to find the equation of line AD and find its other intersection point P with the circumcircle ω.

First, let me find the parametric equation of line AD.

Parametrize from A to D. Let parameter t go from 0 to 1 for points from A to D.

But since we need to find the other intersection with the circle, perhaps it's better to write the equation in terms of slope.

Compute the slope of AD:

Slope m = (30√14/11 -0)/( -15/22 -10 ) = (30√14/11) / (-15/22 - 220/22) = (30√14/11) / (-235/22).

Simplify denominator: -235/22 = (-235)/22.

So, slope m = (30√14/11) * (22/-235) = (30√14 *22)/(11*(-235)).

Simplify: 30 and 235 can both be divided by 5: 30/5=6, 235/5=47.

22 and 11 can be divided by 11: 22/11=2, 11/11=1.

So,

(6√14 *2)/( -47 ) = (12√14)/(-47) = -12√14/47.

So, the slope m is -12√14/47.

Now, equation of line AD: y -0 = m(x -10).

So, y = (-12√14/47)(x -10).

Now, we need to find the other intersection point P of this line with the circumcircle ω.

We have the equation of ω: (x -5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

Let me write that out:

(x -5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

We can substitute y from the line equation into this circle equation.

So, substitute y = (-12√14/47)(x -10) into the circle equation.

Let me denote s = √14 to make the equation

---------------

 less cluttered.

So, y = (-12s/47)(x -10).

Substitute into the circle equation:

(x -5)^2 + [ (-12s/47)(x -10) -5s/56 ]^2 = (75s/56)^2.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute [ (-12s/47)(x -10) -5s/56 ].

Factor out s:

s [ (-12/47)(x -10) -5/56 ].

Let me compute the expression inside the brackets:

(-12/47)(x -10) -5/56.

Let me find a common denominator for 47 and 56. 47 is prime, 56=7*8, so LCM is 47*56=2632.

Convert each term:

-12/47 = (-12*56)/2632 = (-672)/2632.

-5/56 = (-5*47)/2632 = (-235)/2632.

So, the expression becomes:

(-672/2632)(x -10) -235/2632 = [ -672(x -10) -235 ] /2632.

So, the entire term becomes:

s * [ (-672(x -10) -235 ) /2632 ].

So, [ (-12s/47)(x -10) -5s/56 ] = s*(-672(x-10) -235)/2632.

Now, the square of this term is [s*(-672(x-10) -235)/2632]^2 = s²*(672(x-10) +235)^2/(2632)^2.

So, putting it all together, the circle equation becomes:

(x -5)^2 + [s*(-672(x-10) -235)/2632]^2 = (75s/56)^2.

Multiply both sides by (2632)^2 to eliminate denominators:

(x -5)^2*(2632)^2 + s²*( -672(x-10) -235 )^2 = (75s/56)^2*(2632)^2.

Hmm, this seems very messy. Maybe there's a better approach.

Alternatively, since we know point A(10,0) lies on both the line AD and the circle, when we substitute y from the line into the circle equation, we'll get a quadratic equation with roots at A and P. So, we can solve for x, knowing that x=10 is one solution, and the other solution will be x-coordinate of P.

Let me proceed step by step.

First

---------------

, expand the circle equation.

Circle equation: (x -5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

Expand (x -5)^2: x² -10x +25.

Expand (y -5√14/56)^2: y² - (10√14/56)y + (5√14/56)^2.

So, the circle equation becomes:

x² -10x +25 + y² - (10√14/56)y + (5√14/56)^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

Bring all terms to left:

x² -10x +25 + y² - (10√14/56)y + (5√14/56)^2 - (75√14/56)^2 =0.

Simplify the constants:

Compute (5√14/56)^2 = 25*14/(56^2) = 350/3136.

Compute (75√14/56)^2 = 5625*14/(56^2) = 78750/3136.

So, 350/3136 -78750/3136 = (350 -78750)/3136 = (-78400)/3136 = -25.

So, the equation becomes:

x² -10x +25 + y² - (10√14/56)y -25 =0.

Simplify 25 -25: they cancel.

So, x² -10x + y² - (10√14/56)y =0.

Now, substitute y from the line equation: y = (-12√14/47)(x -10).

So, y = (-12√14/47)x + 120√14/47.

Compute y²:

[ (-12√14/47)x + 120√14/47 ]^2.

Let me compute this:

= [ (-12√14/47)x ]^2 + 2*(-12√14/47)x*(120√14/47) + [120√14/47]^2.

Compute each term:

First term: (144*14)x²/(47)^2 = (2016)x²/2209.

Second term: 2*(-12√14)(120√14)/(47^2) x = 2*(-12*120)*(14)/(47^2) x.

Compute 

---------------

12*120=1440, so 2*(-1440)*14= -40320.

So, second term: (-40320)x/(2209).

Third term: (14400*14)/(47^2) = 201600/2209.

So, y² = (2016x² -40320x +201600)/2209.

Now, substitute into the circle equation:

x² -10x + y² - (10√14/56)y =0.

So,

x² -10x + (2016x² -40320x +201600)/2209 - (10√14/56)[ (-12√14/47)x + 120√14/47 ] =0.

Simplify each term.

First, let's compute the third term: -(10√14/56)y.

y = (-12√14/47)x + 120√14/47.

So,

-(10√14/56)*(-12√14/47)x + -(10√14/56)*(120√14/47).

Compute first part:

(10√14 *12√14)/(56*47) x = (120*14)/(56*47) x = (1680)/(2632) x.

Simplify 1680/2632: divide numerator and denominator by 4: 420/658. Again by 2: 210/329.

210 and 329: 329 ÷7=47. 210 ÷7=30. So, 30/47.

So, first part is 30/47 x.

Second part:

-(10√14 *120√14)/(56*47) = -(1200*14)/(56*47) = -(16800)/(2632).

Simplify 16800/2632: divide numerator and denominator by 4: 4200/658. Again by 2: 2100/329.

329 is 7*47. 2100 ÷7=300, 329 ÷7=47.

So, 2100/329 =300/47.

So, the second part is -300/47.

So, putting it all together, the third term is (30/47)x -300/47.

Now, let's write

---------------

 the entire equation:

x² -10x + (2016x² -40320x +201600)/2209 + (30/47)x -300/47 =0.

Multiply everything by 2209 to eliminate denominators:

2209x² -22090x +2016x² -40320x +201600 + (30/47)x*2209 -300/47*2209 =0.

Compute each term:

First term: 2209x².

Second term: -22090x.

Third term: 2016x².

Fourth term: -40320x.

Fifth term: 201600.

Sixth term: (30/47)x *2209 =30*(2209/47)x =30*47x=1410x.

Because 2209 ÷47=47 (since 47²=2209).

Seventh term: -300/47 *2209 = -300*47= -14100.

So, putting it all together:

2209x² +2016x² -22090x -40320x +1410x +201600 -14100=0.

Combine like terms:

x² terms: 2209 +2016=4225.

x terms: -22090 -40320 +1410= (-22090 -40320)= -62410 +1410= -61000.

Constants: 201600 -14100=187500.

So, equation is:

4225x² -61000x +187500=0.

Simplify by dividing all terms by 25:

4225 ÷25=169.

61000 ÷25=2440.

187500 ÷25=7500.

So, equation becomes:

169x² -2440x +7500=0.

Now, solve this quadratic equation.

Quadratic in form: ax² +bx +c=0.

a=169, b=-2440, c=7500.

Use quadratic formula:

x = [2440 ± sqrt(2440² -4*169*7500)]/(2*169).

Compute discriminant:

D=2440² -4*169*7500.

Compute 2440²: 2440*2440. Let me compute 244^2 and then add two zeros.

244^2: 244*244.

Compute 200*200=40000.

200*44=8800.

44*200=8800.

44*44=1936.

So, (200+44)^2=200² +2*200*44 +44²=40000 +17600 +1936=40000+17600=57600+1936=59536.

So, 244^2=59536, so 2440²=59536*100=5,953,600.

Now, compute 4*169*7500:

4*169=676.

676*7500=676*75*100.

Compute 676*75:

676 *75 = (600*75) + (76*75) =45,000 +5,700=50,700.

So, 676*7500=50,700*100=5,070,000.

Thus, discriminant D=5,953,600 -5,070,000=883,600.

So, sqrt(D)=sqrt(883600). Let's compute this.

8

---------------

83600 divided by 100 is 8836. sqrt(8836)=94, because 94^2=8836.

So, sqrt(883600)=940.

Thus, x = [2440 ±940]/(2*169).

Compute both solutions:

x1=(2440+940)/(338)=3380/338=10.

x2=(2440-940)/338=1500/338.

Simplify 1500/338: divide numerator and denominator by 2:750/169.

So, x=10 and x=750/169.

We already know that x=10 corresponds to point A, so the other intersection point P has x-coordinate 750/169.

Now, find the corresponding y-coordinate.

From the line equation y = (-12√14/47)(x -10).

Plug x=750/169:

y = (-12√14/47)(750/169 -10).

Compute 750/169 -10=750/169 -1690/169= (750 -1690)/169= (-940)/169.

So,

y = (-12√14/47)*(-940/169) = (12*940√14)/(47*169).

Simplify 940/47: 47*20=940. So, 940=47*20.

So,

(12*47*20√14)/(47*169)= (12*20√14)/169=240√14/169.

So, point P is at (750/169, 240√14/169).

Now, we need to find the length AP.

Point A is at (10,0), point P is at (750/169, 240√14/169).

Compute the distance between them.

AP = sqrt[ (10 -750/169)^2 + (0 -240√14/169)^2 ].

Compute 10 as 1690/169, so 10 -750/169= (1690 -750)/169=940/169.

So,

AP = sqrt[ (940/169)^2 + (240√14/169)^2 ].

Factor out (1/169)^2:

AP = (1/169) * sqrt(940² + (240√14)^2 ).

Compute inside the sqrt:

940² = (900 +40)^2=900² +2*900*40 +40²=810000 +72000 +1600=883600.

(240√14)^2=240² *14=57600*14=806400.

So, inside sqrt:883600 +806400=1,690,000.

So,

AP = (1/169)*sqrt(1,690,000).

sqrt(1,690,000)=1,300 (since 1300²=1,690,000).

So,

AP=1300/169.

Simplify 1300/169: 169*7=1183, 169*7=1183, 1300-1183=117. 169*0.7=118.3, but perhaps

---------------

 better to divide numerator and denominator by 13.

1300 ÷13=100, 169 ÷13=13.

So, AP=100/13.

So, AP=100/13. 100 and 13 are coprime, so m=100, n=13, m +n=113.


To solve the problem, we start by noting that triangle \(ABC\) has sides \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\). The tangents at \(B\) and \(C\) intersect at point \(D\), and line \(AD\) intersects the circumcircle \(\omega\) again at \(P\). We aim to find the length \(AP\).

1. **Power of a Point**: Since \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\), the power of point \(D\) with respect to \(\omega\) is \(DB^2 = DC^2 = DA \cdot DP\).

2. **Coordinate Setup**: Placing \(C\) at \((0, 0)\) and \(A\) at \((10, 0)\), we find the coordinates of \(B\) by solving the system of equations derived from the distances \(AB = 5\) and \(BC = 9\). This gives \(B = \left(\frac{39}{5}, \frac{6\sqrt{14}}{5}\right)\).

3. **Circumcircle Equation**: The circumcircle \(\omega\) of \(ABC\) is determined by finding the perpendicular bisectors of \(AC\) and \(AB\), leading to the center \(O = \left(5, \frac{5\sqrt{14}}{56}\right)\) and radius \(R = \frac{75\sqrt{14}}{56}\).

4. **Tangents at \(B\) and \(C\)**: The equations of the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\) are derived. Solving these gives the coordinates of \(D\) as \(\left(-\frac{15}{22}, \frac{30\sqrt{14}}{11}\right)\).

5. **Line \(AD\)**: The equation of line \(AD\) is found, and its intersection with \(\omega\) gives the coordinates of \(P\). Solving the quadratic equation for the intersection yields \(P = \left(\frac{750}{169}, \frac{240\sqrt{14}}{169}\right)\).

6. **Distance \(AP\)**: Using the distance formula between \(A(10, 0)\) and \(P\left(\frac{750}{169}, \frac{240\sqrt{14}}{169}\right)\), we find \(AP = \frac{100}{13}\).

Thus, \(AP = \frac{100}{13}\), and \(m + n = 100 + 13 = 113\).
