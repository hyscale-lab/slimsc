Okay, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, Alice

---------------

 goes first. On each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 make

---------------

 it so that Bob can guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, so this is a combinatorial game theory problem. I

---------------

 remember these often involve figuring out winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no

---------------

 matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite; no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

In

---------------

 this case, the players can remove 1 or 4 tokens each turn. So for each n, I need to determine if it

---------------

's a winning or losing position.

Let me think about small n first to see if I can find a pattern.

n=1: Alice takes 1 and wins. So Bob can't win here,

---------------

 so n=1 is a losing position for Bob.

n=2: Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. Then

---------------

 Bob can take 1 and win. Wait, but wait, no. Wait, if Alice takes 1 from 2, leaving

---------------

 1. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. So Bob can win. So n=2 is a winning position for Bob?

---------------

 Wait, no, wait. Wait, when n=2, it's Alice's turn first. So Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for

---------------

 Bob, who then takes 1 and wins. So in that case, Bob would win. But wait, is there another option for Alice? She

---------------

 can also take 4, but n=2, so she can't take 4. So she must take 1. So

---------------

 Bob can win when n=2.

Wait, but that's confusing. So if n=2, Alice takes 1, Bob

---------------

 takes 1 and wins. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob.



---------------

Wait, but maybe I should think in terms of who is the current player. So for each n, if the current player can force

---------------

 a win, it's a winning position, else it's a losing position.

Let me make a table:

n | Winner

---------------

 (if both play optimally)
--- | ---
1 | Alice (takes 1)
2 | Alice takes 1, Bob

---------------

 takes 1 → Bob wins. Wait, no, wait. Wait, if n=2, Alice's turn. She can take 1, leaving 1.

---------------

 Then Bob takes 1 and wins. So Alice can't prevent Bob from winning. So for n=2, the current

---------------

 player (Alice) cannot force a win, so it's a losing position for Alice, meaning a winning position for Bob.



---------------

Wait, no. Wait, the way it's defined is that the person who takes the last token wins. So when n=2, Alice

---------------

's options are to take 1 or 4. She can't take 4, so she takes 1, leaving 1. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. So yes

---------------

, Bob can win. So for n=2, the current player (Alice) can't force a win, so n

---------------

=2 is a losing position for Alice. So Bob can win when n=2.

Wait, but I'm getting confused.

---------------

 Maybe I should think in terms of Grundy numbers or something. Let me try to model this as a series of positions.



---------------

Let's define the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L) for the current player.

n=0: Well

---------------

, the game is over, so no one can move. But in our case, the last person to take a token wins, so n

---------------

=0 isn't a position in the game. But for analysis, we can think of n=0 as a losing position because the

---------------

 player can't make a move.

n=1: The current player can take 1 and win. So W.

n=2: Current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who can then take it and win. Or

---------------

 can the current player take 4? No, because n=2. So only option is to take 1. So

---------------

 after taking 1, the opponent is in a winning position, so n=2 is L for the current player. Because

---------------

 whatever move you make, opponent can win.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, if you're at n=2, you

---------------

 can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent. But the opponent can take 1 and win. So in that case, the

---------------

 current player (at n=2) can't force a win. So n=2 is L.

n=3: Current player can take 1, leaving 2 for

---------------

 the opponent. Since n=2 is L, the opponent is in a losing position, so current player can win. So n=3 is W.

n=4: Current player can take 4 and win immediately

---------------

. So W.

n=5: Current player can take 1, leaving 4, which is W for the opponent. Or take 4, leaving 1, which is W for the opponent. So

---------------

 both options leave opponent in W, so n=5 is L.

n=6: Current player can take 1, leaving 5 (L),

---------------

 so opponent is in L. So current player can win by taking 1. So n=6 is W.

n=7: Current

---------------

 player can take 1, leaving 6 (W). Or take 4, leaving 3 (W). So opponent

---------------

 can win in both cases. So n=7 is L.

n=8: Current player can take 1, leaving 7 (L). So opponent is in L, so current player can win. So n=8 is W.

n=9: Current

---------------

 player can take 1, leaving 8 (W), or take 4, leaving 5 (L). Wait, so

---------------

 if they take 4, leaving 5 (L), then opponent is in a losing position. So current player can win

---------------

 by taking 4. So n=9 is W.

Wait, no. Wait, n=9, taking 4 leaves 5,

---------------

 which is L. So opponent can't win from 5, so current player can win. So n=9 is W.

Wait, but

---------------

 let me check this again.

Wait, n=5 is L, so if I leave opponent at 5, they lose

---------------

. So if I can take 4 from 9, leaving 5, which is L, then I can force a

---------------

 win. So yes, n=9 is W.

n=10: Current player can take 1, leaving 9 (W), or take 4, leaving 6 (W). Both

---------------

 options leave opponent in W, so n=10 is L.

Wait, let's list these out:

n | W

---------------

/L
0 | L (no move)
1 | W
2 | L
3 | W
4 | W
5 | L
6 | W
7 | L
8 | W
9 | W
10| L
1

---------------

1| ?

Let me continue.

n=11: Current player can take 1, leaving 10 (L). So opponent

---------------

 is in L. So current player can win by taking 1. So n=11 is W.

n=12: Current

---------------

 player can take 1, leaving 11 (W), or take 4, leaving 8 (W). So

---------------

 both options leave opponent in W. So n=12 is L.

n=13: Current player can take 1, leaving 12 (L). So opponent is in L, so current player can win. So n=13 is W.

n=14: Current player can take 1, leaving 13 (W), or take 4, leaving 10 (L). So

---------------

 if they take 4, opponent is in L. So current player can win by taking 4. So n=14 is W.

n=15: Current player can take 1, leaving 14 (W), or take 4, leaving 11 (W). So both options leave opponent in W. So n=15 is L.

Hmm

---------------

, looking at this, let's see the pattern.

The losing positions so far are n=2,5,7,10,12,15.



---------------

Wait, what's the difference between these? Let's see:

2,5,7,10,12,15.



---------------

The differences between consecutive terms:

5-2=3

7-5=2

10-7=3

12-10=2

15-12=3

Hmm, alternating

---------------

 3 and 2.

So 2, then +3=5, +2=7, +3=10, +2=12, +3=15, then

---------------

 +2=17, etc.

So the losing positions are every 3 and 2 steps alternately.

Wait, let

---------------

 me check n=16.

n=16: Current player can take 1, leaving 15 (L), so opponent is in L. So current player can win. So n=16 is W.

n=17: Current

---------------

 player can take 1, leaving 16 (W), or take 4, leaving 13 (W). So both options leave opponent in W. So n=17 is L.

So

---------------

 yes, n=17 is L. So the pattern continues: 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,

---------------

20,...

Wait, so the losing positions are n=2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,...

---------------

 etc.

So the losing positions are numbers that are 2 mod 5 and 0 mod 5? Wait, let

---------------

 me check.

Wait, 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,

---------------

22,25,27,...

Looking at these numbers, they seem to be numbers congruent to 2 mod 5 and

---------------

 0 mod 5?

Wait, 2 mod 5 is 2,7,12,17,22,27,...



---------------

Wait, but 5 is 0 mod 5. So maybe the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod 5.



---------------

Wait, let's see:

n=0: L (but not in our problem)

n=2: L (2 mod 5 is

---------------

 2)

n=5: L (0 mod 5)

n=7: L (2 mod 5)



---------------

n=10: L (0 mod 5)

n=12: L (2 mod 5)

n=15: L (0 mod 5)

n=17: L (2 mod 5)

n=20: L (0 mod 5)

n

---------------

=22: L (2 mod 5)

So yes, the losing positions are n ≡ 0 or 2 mod 5.

Wait

---------------

, does this hold?

Let me check n=14: W. 14 mod 5 is 4,

---------------

 which is neither 0 nor 2, so it's a winning position. Correct.

n=13: W.

---------------

 13 mod 5 is 3. Correct.

n=16: W. 16 mod 5 is 1. Correct.

n=18

---------------

: Let's see, n=18: current player can take 1, leaving 17 (L), so opponent

---------------

 is in L. So current player can win. So n=18 is W.

n=18 mod 5 is 3.

---------------

 Correct.

n=19: current player can take 1, leaving 18 (W), or take 4, leaving 15 (L). So by

---------------

 taking 4, opponent is in L. So n=19 is W.

n=20: current player can take 1, leaving 19 (W), or take 4, leaving 16 (W). So both

---------------

 options leave opponent in W. So n=20 is L.

Yes, 20 mod 5 is 0,

---------------

 so it's a losing position. So the pattern seems to hold.

So the losing positions are n ≡ 0 or 2 mod 5.

So

---------------

 in other words, n is congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5.

So for Bob to have a winning strategy, n

---------------

 must be a losing position for Alice, which is when n ≡ 0 or 2 mod 5.

Wait, but

---------------

 wait, the initial player is Alice. So if n is a losing position, then the current player (Alice) cannot force a win, meaning

---------------

 Bob can. So yes, the losing positions are when n ≡ 0 or 2 mod 5.

So now

---------------

, I need to find the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 where n ≡ 0 or 2 mod 5.

So total

---------------

 numbers from 1 to 2024.

Number of n ≡ 0 mod 5: floor(2024/5) = 404 (

---------------

since 5*404=2020, then 2024 is 2020 +4, so 404 numbers).



---------------

Number of n ≡ 2 mod 5: Let's see, numbers start at 2,7,12,... up to ≤

---------------

2024.

The last term is the largest number ≤2024 that is 2 mod 5.

2

---------------

024 ÷5: 2024=5*404 +4, so 2024 mod

---------------

 5 is 4.

So the largest number ≤2024 that is 2 mod 5 is 2024 - (4-2) = 2024 -2=2022.

---------------

 Because 2022 mod5 is 2020+2=2 mod5.

So the sequence is 2,7,12,...2022.

This

---------------

 is an arithmetic sequence with first term 2, last term 2022, common difference 5.

Number of terms: ((

---------------

2022 - 2)/5) +1 = (2020/5)+1=404 +1=405.

Wait, let

---------------

 me compute it properly.

The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d.

Here

---------------

, a_1=2, d=5, a_n=2022.

So 2022=2 + (n-1)*5 → 2020=(

---------------

n-1)*5 → n-1=404 → n=405.

So there are 405 numbers ≡2 mod5.



---------------

Similarly, numbers ≡0 mod5: from 5,10,...2020. The last term is 2020,

---------------

 which is 5*404.

Number of terms: 404.

So total losing positions where Bob can win: 405 +

---------------

404=809.

Wait, but let me check: 405 numbers ≡2 mod5 and

---------------

 404 numbers ≡0 mod5, so total 809.

But wait, let me make sure that

---------------

 2024 is included if necessary. Wait, 2024 is 4 mod5, so it

---------------

's not included in either 0 or 2 mod5. So the counts are correct.

So the answer is 809.

Wait, but let

---------------

 me double-check the counts.

Numbers ≡0 mod5 up to 2024: 2020 is 5*404, so 

---------------

404 numbers.

Numbers ≡2 mod5: the first is 2, last is 2022.



---------------

Number of terms: ((2022 -2)/5)+1 = (2020/5)+1=404 +1=405.

So

---------------

 total is 404 +405=809.

Yes, that seems correct.

So the number of positive integers n ≤2024 where Bob can guarantee a win is 809.


To

---------------

 determine the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) for which Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game using

---------------

 combinatorial game theory. The game involves players taking turns removing 1 or 4 tokens, with Alice going first. The player

---------------

 who takes the last token wins.

We identify the positions as winning (W) or losing (L) for the current player. A

---------------

 losing position means the current player cannot force a win, allowing the opponent to guarantee victory. Through analysis, we find that the losing positions occur when \( n \equiv 0 \) or \( 2 \pmod{5} \).

To count the number

---------------

 of such \( n \) values up to 2024:
1. **Numbers \( \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \):** These are 5, 10, 15, ..., 2020. There are \( \left\lfloor \frac{2024}{5} \right\rfloor = 404 \) such numbers.
2. **Numbers \( \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \):** These are 2, 7, 12, ..., 2022. The sequence has \( \left( \frac{2022 - 2}{5} \right) + 1 = 405 \) terms.

Adding these, the total number of losing positions is \( 404 + 405 = 809 \).

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) where Bob can guarantee a win is:

\boxed
