Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a

---------------

 + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, okay. Let me try

---------------

 to break this down.

First, the problem is about finding triples (a, b, c) that are nonnegative integers.

---------------

 So, a, b, c can be 0 or any positive integer, but they must add up to 300. The

---------------

 second condition is a bit more complicated: it's a symmetric expression involving squares and products. Let me write that expression out again

---------------

 to see if I can simplify it.

The expression is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Hmm

---------------

, I notice that each term is a square of one variable multiplied by another. Maybe I can factor this or find a way

---------------

 to express it in terms of the sum a + b + c.

Wait, let's see: a²b + a²c is

---------------

 equal to a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c is b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b is c²(a + b). So,

---------------

 the entire expression can be written as a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b). That

---------------

's a bit neater.

But since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), right

---------------

? Because if a + b + c = 300, then b + c = 300 - a. Similarly, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c. So substit

---------------

uting these into the expression, it becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c)

---------------

 = 6,000,000.

So now, the equation is:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm

---------------

, interesting. So each term is of the form x²(300 - x), where x is a, b, or c. Let

---------------

 me think about that function f(x) = x²(300 - x). Maybe I can analyze this function to see

---------------

 how it behaves.

Let me compute f(x) for different values of x. For example, when x is 0, f(0) = 0. When x is 100, f(100) = 100²*(300 - 100) = 10,000 * 200 = 2,000,000. Hmm

---------------

, that's a pretty big value. If x is 200, f(200) = 40,000 * 100 = 4,000,000. And

---------------

 if x is 300, f(300) = 90,000 * 0 = 0. So

---------------

 the function f(x) starts at 0, increases, reaches a maximum at some point, then decreases back to 0.



---------------

Wait, so the function f(x) = x²(300 - x) is a cubic function. Let me find

---------------

 its maximum. To find the maximum, I can take the derivative and set it to zero. But since we're dealing with integers, maybe it

---------------

's not necessary, but just for understanding the behavior.

So, f(x) = x²(300 - x) = 300x² - x³. The derivative f’(x) is 600x - 3x². Setting this

---------------

 equal to zero: 600x - 3x² = 0 => x(600 - 3x) = 0 => x=0 or x=200. So the

---------------

 function has a maximum at x=200. So, f(200) is 4,000,000,

---------------

 which is the maximum value of f(x). So the function increases up to x=200, then decreases after that.

Wait

---------------

, but in our case, since a + b + c = 300, each of a, b, c is

---------------

 at most 300. So, the maximum value any of them can take is 300, but if

---------------

 one is 300, the others are zero, making the sum 300. Let me think about what

---------------

 the sum a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) equals

---------------

 6,000,000.

Since each term can be up to 4,000,000 (

---------------

if x=200), but when x=200, the term is 4,000,000, so

---------------

 if two variables are 200, that would be 8,000,000, which is more

---------------

 than 6,000,000. So perhaps only one variable can be 200, and

---------------

 the others must be lower.

Wait, but let's think about the possible maximums. Let me consider the case where one

---------------

 variable is 200. Let's say a=200, then b + c=100. Then

---------------

, the term a²(300 - a) would be 200²*(100) = 40,000 * 100 = 4,000,000. Then, the

---------------

 other terms would be b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c). Since b + c=100, let

---------------

 me let b= k, c=100 -k. Then, the sum becomes k²(300 -k) + (100 -k)^2*(

---------------

300 - (100 -k)).

Simplify that: k²(300 - k) + (100 -k)^2*(200 +k). Hmm, that

---------------

 seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can compute the value when a=200 and b + c=100.



---------------

Let me see if it's possible for the total sum to be 6,000,000. So

---------------

, if a=200, then the sum is 4,000,000 + [b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c)] = 6,000,000. So,

---------------

 the sum of the other two terms must be 2,000,000.

Now, since b and c are nonnegative integers adding up to 100, their

---------------

 possible values are from 0 to 100. Let's see if any pair (b, c) can make

---------------

 b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 2,000,000.

But

---------------

 wait, if b=100, then c=0, and the expression becomes 100²*(200) + 0 = 10,000 * 200 = 2,000,000. Oh

---------------

! So if a=200, b=100, c=0, then the sum would be 4,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 0 = 6,000,000. So

---------------

 that's a valid solution. Similarly, if a=200, b=0, c=100, that

---------------

's also a solution.

Wait, but are there other possibilities when a=200? Let me check for other values

---------------

 of b and c where b + c=100. Let's say b=50, c=50. Then, the

---------------

 expression becomes 50²*(250) + 50²*(250) = 25

---------------

00*250 + 2500*250 = 625,000 + 625,000 = 1,250,000. Adding

---------------

 that to the 4,000,000 from a=200 gives 5,250,000, which is less than 6,000,000. So that

---------------

's not enough.

What if b=99, c=1? Then, 99²*(201) + 1²*(299) = (

---------------

9801 * 201) + (1 * 299). Let me compute that:

9801 * 200 = 1,960,200,

---------------

 plus 9801 = 1,960,200 + 9,801 = 1,970,001. Then,

---------------

 1²*299 = 299. So total is 1,970,001 + 299 = 1,970,300. So

---------------

 that's still way less than 2,000,000. So, only when b=100 and

---------------

 c=0 (or vice versa) does the sum reach 2,000,000. So,

---------------

 when a=200, the only possible (b, c) pairs are (100, 0) and (0, 100). So

---------------

 that gives two solutions: (200, 100, 0) and (200, 0, 100). But

---------------

 wait, since the variables are symmetric, maybe other permutations are also possible.

Wait, but wait: in this problem, the

---------------

 variables are symmetric, so any permutation of (200, 100, 0) would be a solution

---------------

. Let me check that. So, (200, 100, 0), (200, 0, 100), (100, 200, 0), (100, 0, 200), (0, 200, 100), and (0, 100, 200) would

---------------

 all be valid solutions, right? Because in each case, one variable is 200, another is 100, and the last is 0.



---------------

Wait, but when a=100, then what happens? Let me try a=100. Then, b + c = 200. The

---------------

 expression becomes a²(300 - a) + ... So, a=100, so a²*(200) = 10,000 * 200 = 2,000,000. Then, the sum

---------------

 of b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) must be 6,000,000 - 2,000,000 = 4,000,000.

Now

---------------

, since b + c=200, let me see if any pairs (b, c) can satisfy this. Let

---------------

 me try b=200, c=0. Then, b²*(300 - 200) = 40,000 * 100 = 4,000,000. So

---------------

 that would make the sum 2,000,000 + 4,000,000 + 0 = 6,000,000. So yes

---------------

, (100, 200, 0) would be a solution, and similarly for other permutations.

Wait, so when

---------------

 a=100, and b=200, c=0, that's a valid solution. Similarly, when

---------------

 a=100, b=0, c=200. So, each of these permutations would give a

---------------

 valid solution.

So, so far, I've identified that the solutions are permutations of (200, 100, 0).

---------------

 How many such permutations are there? Let me count.

In the case where all three numbers are distinct, the number of permutations is 3! = 6. So

---------------

, for each arrangement where a=200, b=100, c=0, and all permutations, there

---------------

 are 6 solutions. Let me list them:

1. (200, 100, 0)
2. (200, 0, 100)
3. (100, 200, 0)
4. (100, 0, 200)
5. (0, 200, 100)
6. (0, 100, 200)

So

---------------

, that's 6 solutions so far. Are there any other solutions where the variables are not just permutations of (200, 100, 0)?

Let

---------------

 me consider another possibility. Suppose two variables are 150, and the third is 0. Let's check if

---------------

 that would satisfy the conditions. Let me compute a + b + c = 150 + 150 + 0 = 300, which satisfies

---------------

 the first condition. Now, let's compute the second condition:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Pl

---------------

ugging in a=150, b=150, c=0:

150²*150 + 150²*0 + 150²*150 + 150²*0 + 0²*150 + 0²*150.

So

---------------

, that's (22500 * 150) + 0 + (22500 * 150) + 0 + 0 + 0.



---------------

Each term is 22500 * 150 = 3,375,000. So,

---------------

 two of them would be 6,750,000, which is more than 6,000,000. So that's too big. So,

---------------

 that's not a solution.

Alternatively, maybe two variables are 100, and the third is 100.

---------------

 Wait, a=100, b=100, c=100. Let's check:

a

---------------

 + b + c = 300, which is good.

Now, the expression:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Each

---------------

 term is 100²*100 = 10,000 * 100 = 1,000,000. There are 6 terms, so 

---------------

6 * 1,000,000 = 6,000,000. Oh

---------------

! So (100,100,100) is another solution. So that's another triple.

---------------

 Now, how many permutations of this are there? Since all three are the same, there's only one unique solution here:

---------------

 (100, 100, 100).

So that's another solution. So now, we

---------------

 have 6 + 1 = 7 solutions.

Wait, but is that the only solution where all three variables are equal? Because

---------------

 if a = b = c, then each is 100. So that's the only case where all three are equal.



---------------

Now, are there any other solutions where two variables are equal, and the third is different? Let's suppose, for example, that two variables are 

---------------

150, and the third is 0, but we saw that sum is too big. Alternatively, maybe two variables are 1

---------------

20, and the third is 60, but I'm not sure. Let me try to find another solution.

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps one variable is 200, another is 100, and the third is 0, which

---------------

 we've already considered. Or maybe one variable is 200, another is 50, and the third is 50.

---------------

 Let's check if that works.

So, a=200, b=50, c=50.

Sum

---------------

: 200 +50 +50=300, which is good.

Now, compute the expression:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

a

---------------

²b = 40,000 *50=2,000,000
a²c=40,000 *50=2,000,000
b²a=2500 *200=500,000
b²c=2500*50=125,000
c²a=2500*200=500,000
c²b=2500*50=125,000

Now, adding

---------------

 all these up:

2,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 4,000,000

500,000 + 125,000 = 625,000



---------------

500,000 + 125,000 = 625,000

Total

---------------

 sum: 4,000,000 + 625,000 + 625,000 = 5,250,000.

---------------

 That's less than 6,000,000, so that's not a solution.

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 another approach. Let's think about possible values for a, b, c. Since the function f(x) = x²(300 - x) is

---------------

 involved, and we know that f(200) is 4,000,000, which

---------------

 is the maximum. So, if two variables are 200, then the sum would be 8,000,000, which is more

---------------

 than 6,000,000. So, that's impossible.

What about one variable being 200, another 100, and the third 0?

---------------

 We saw that gives exactly 6,000,000. What about another case where one variable is 200, another is,

---------------

 say, 150, and the third is 50. Let's check:

a=200, b=150, c=50.

Sum

---------------

: 200+150+50=400, which is more than 300. So

---------------

 that's invalid.

Wait, maybe a=150, b=150, c=0. Sum is 300.

---------------

 Let's compute the expression:

a²b = 22500 *150 = 3,375,000
a²c=22500*0=0
b²a=22500*150=3,375,000
b²c=22500*0=0
c²a=0*150=0
c²b=0*150=0

Total

---------------

 sum: 3,375,000 + 0 + 3,375,000 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 6,750,000, which is more

---------------

 than 6,000,000. So that's not a solution.

Alternatively, perhaps a=15

---------------

0, b=100, c=50.

Sum: 150+100+50=300.

Compute the expression:

a²b=22500*100=2,250,000
a²c=22500*50=1,125,000
b²a=10,000*150=1,500,000
b²c=10,000*50=500,000
c²a=2500*150=375,000
c²b=2500*100=250,000

Adding

---------------

 these up:

2,250,000 + 1,125,000 = 3,375,000

1,500,000 + 500,000 = 2,000,000

375,000 + 250,000 = 625,000

Total: 3,375,000 + 2,000,000 = 5,375,000 + 625,000 = 6,000,000.

Wait a

---------------

 minute! That adds up exactly to 6,000,000. So, (150, 100, 50) is another solution. Now

---------------

, that's interesting because it's a different kind of triple, not just a permutation of (200, 100, 0).

---------------

 So, that's another solution.

Wait, so how many permutations of this triple are there? Let's see, in (

---------------

150, 100, 50), all three numbers are distinct, so the number of permutations is 3! = 6. So that's

---------------

 6 more solutions. Let me list them:

1. (150, 100, 50)
2. (150, 50, 100)
3. (100, 150, 50)
4. (100, 50, 150)
5. (50, 150, 100)
6. (50, 100, 150)

So, that's 6 more solutions. So

---------------

 now, total solutions are 6 (from 200,100,0) + 1 (from 100,100,100) + 6 (from 150,100,50) = 13 solutions

---------------

. Wait, but is that correct? Let me double-check.

Wait, wait, when I took a=150, b=100, c=50, the

---------------

 sum was 6,000,000, which worked. So that's a valid solution, and all

---------------

 permutations of this would also be valid. So that adds 6 solutions.

But are there more such triples? Let me try

---------------

 another case. Suppose a=120, b=120, c=60. Let's check if

---------------

 that works.

Sum: 120+120+60=300, which is good.

Compute the expression:

a²b = 14,400 * 120 = 1,728,000
a²c=14,400 * 60 = 864,000
b²a=14,400 *120=1,728,000
b²c=14,400 *60=864,000
c²a=3,600 *120=432,000
c²b=3,600 *120=432,000

Adding

---------------

 these:

1,728,000 + 864,000 = 2,592,000
1,728,000 + 864,000 = 2,592,000
432,000 + 432,000 = 864,000

Total sum: 2,592,000 + 2,592,000 = 5,184,000 + 864,000 = 6,048,000. That

---------------

's more than 6,000,000, so that's not a solution.

Hmm, maybe another

---------------

 case. Let me try a=100, b=100, c=100. That's

---------------

 the all-100s case, which we've already considered. Let me try a=180, b=90, c=30.

Sum: 180 +90 +30=300.

Compute the expression:

a²b = 32,400 *90=2,916,000
a²c=32,400 *30=972,000
b²a=8,100 *180=1,458,000
b²c=8,100 *30=243,000
c²a=900 *180=162,000
c²b=900 *90=81,000

Adding them

---------------

 up:

2,916,000 + 972,000 = 3,888,000
1,458,000 + 243,000 = 1,701,000
162,000 + 81,000 = 243,000

Total: 3,888,000 + 1,701,000 = 5,589,000 + 243,000 = 5,832,000. That

---------------

's less than 6,000,000, so not a solution.

Hmm, maybe another approach. Let me consider

---------------

 that the expression a²b + a²c + ... can be rewritten as ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c). Wait, let

---------------

 me check that.

Wait, a²b + a²c = a²(b + c) = a²(300 - a),

---------------

 as before. So, perhaps it's better to stick with the earlier approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the expression as

---------------

 symmetric and look for solutions where two variables are equal, and the third is different.

So, let's assume that a = b,

---------------

 and then find c such that a + a + c = 300 => 2a + c = 300 => c = 300 - 2a.

Now, the

---------------

 expression becomes:

a²a + a²c + a²a + a²c + c²a + c²a.



---------------

Wait, that's a bit messy. Wait, let me compute each term:

a²b = a^3, since

---------------

 b = a.
a²c = a²c
b²a = a^3
b²c = a²c
c²a = c²a
c²b = c²a

So, the

---------------

 total expression is a^3 + a²c + a^3 + a²c + c²a + c²a.

S

---------------

implify:

2a^3 + 2a²c + 2c²a.

Factor out 2a:

2a(a² + a c + c²).

But

---------------

 since c = 300 - 2a, let's substitute that in:

2a [a² + a(300 - 2a) + (300 - 2a)^2 ]



---------------

Simplify inside the brackets:

a² + 300a - 2a² + (300 - 2a)^2.

Compute

---------------

 (300 - 2a)^2 = 90000 - 1200a + 4a².

So, the

---------------

 expression inside becomes:

a² + 300a - 2a² + 90000 - 1200a + 4a²



---------------

Combine like terms:

(a² - 2a² + 4a²) + (300a - 1200a) + 90000



---------------

That's (3a²) + (-900a) + 90000.

So, the entire

---------------

 expression is 2a (3a² - 900a + 90000).

Set this equal to 6,000,000:

2a (3a² - 900a + 90000) = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 2a (assuming a ≠ 0):

3a² - 900a + 90000 = 3,000,000 / a.

Hmm

---------------

, that's a bit complicated. Let me multiply both sides by a to eliminate the denominator:

3a^3 - 900a^2 + 90,000a = 3,000,000.

Bring all terms to one side:

3a^3 - 900a^2 + 90,000a - 3,000,000 = 0.

Div

---------------

ide through by 3 to simplify:

a^3 - 300a^2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0.

Hmm

---------------

, that's a cubic equation. Let me try to find integer roots. The possible rational roots are factors of 1,000,000 divided by factors of 1, so possible

---------------

 roots are ±1, ±2, ..., up to ±1,000,000, which is a lot, but maybe

---------------

 I can find a root by testing some small integers.

Let me try a=100:

100^3 - 300*(100)^2 + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000 =

---------------

 1,000,000 - 300*10,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000.

Compute

---------------

 each term:

1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0. So

---------------

, a=100 is a root.

Therefore, we can factor (a - 100) from the cubic equation

---------------

. Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.

Dividing a^3 - 300a^2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 by (a - 100):

Using synthetic division:

100 | 1   -300    30000    -1000000
         

---------------

 100      -20000      1000000
      --------------------------------
          1    -200     10000        

---------------

 0

So, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a^2 - 200a + 10,000) = 0.

Now, set

---------------

 each factor equal to zero:

a - 100 = 0 => a = 100.

a^2 - 200a + 10,000 = 0. Let's compute discriminant: D

---------------

 = (200)^2 - 4*1*10,000 = 40,000 - 40,000 = 0. So, a

---------------

 = [200 ± 0]/2 = 100.

Thus, the only real root is a=100,

---------------

 with multiplicity two.

So, in the case where a = b, the only solution is a=100, which

---------------

 gives c=300 - 2a=100. So, that's the triple (100,100,100), which we've already considered

---------------

. So, that's the only solution when a = b.

Now, are there any other cases where two variables are equal,

---------------

 but not a=100, b=100, c=100? Let me check another case

---------------

 where, say, a = c, and b is different.

So, let me suppose that a = c. Then, a

---------------

 + b + a = 300 => 2a + b = 300 => b = 300 - 2a.

Now

---------------

, the expression becomes:

a²b + a²a + b²a + b²a + a²a + a²b.

Wait, let

---------------

 me compute each term:

a²b (twice)
a²a = a³ (twice)
b²a (twice)

So, total

---------------

 expression is 2a²b + 2a³ + 2b²a.

Factor out 2a:

2a(a² + a b + b²).

Since

---------------

 b = 300 - 2a, substitute that in:

2a [a² + a(300 - 2a) + (300 - 2a)^2 ]

---------------

.

Simplify inside the brackets:

a² + 300a - 2a² + (300 - 2a)^2.

Compute

---------------

 (300 - 2a)^2 = 90,000 - 1,200a + 4a².

So, inside

---------------

 the brackets:

a² + 300a - 2a² + 90,000 - 1,200a + 4a².



---------------

Combine like terms:

(a² - 2a² + 4a²) + (300a - 1,200a) + 90,000.



---------------

Which is 3a² - 900a + 90,000.

So, the entire

---------------

 expression is 2a*(3a² - 900a + 90,000) = 6,000,000.

Div

---------------

ide both sides by 2a (assuming a ≠ 0):

3a² - 900a + 90,000 = 3,000,000 / a.

Multiply both sides by a:

3a^3 - 900a^2 + 90,000a = 3,000,000.

Bring

---------------

 all terms to one side:

3a^3 - 900a^2 + 90,000a - 3,000,000 = 0.

Divide through by 3:

a^3 - 300a^2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0.

Wait

---------------

, that's the same equation as before. So, the only solution is a=100, which gives b=300 - 2*

---------------

100=100, c=a=100. So, again, the triple is (100,100,100).



---------------

So, in the case where two variables are equal, the only solution is when all three are equal to 100.

Now

---------------

, let's consider the case where all three variables are different. So, a, b, c are all distinct.

Wait

---------------

, but earlier I found that (150,100,50) is a solution. Let me check

---------------

 if that's the only other case or if there are others.

Wait, perhaps I can find another solution by assuming that a

---------------

=150, b=100, c=50, as before. But let me see if there

---------------

's a way to find all such possible triples.

Alternatively, perhaps the only solutions are the permutations of (200,100,0) and (150,100,50), plus the triple

---------------

 (100,100,100). Let me see if that's the case.

Wait, let

---------------

 me try another approach. Let me suppose that one of the variables is 100. So, let's set a=100, then b + c = 200.

The

---------------

 expression becomes:

100²*b + 100²*c + b²*100 + b²*c + c²*100 + c²*b.

Which

---------------

 is 10,000*b + 10,000*c + 100b² + 100c² + 100c² + c

---------------

²*b.

Wait, maybe I should compute it step by step.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to compute it

---------------

 as a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

Since a=100, and

---------------

 b + c=200, then:

a²*(200) = 100²*200 = 10,000*200=2,000,000.

b

---------------

²*(100 + c) + c²*(100 + b) = b²*(300 - b) + c²*(300 - c),

---------------

 since a=100, so 100 + c = 300 - b, and 100 + b = 300 - c.

Wait

---------------

, that's similar to the earlier substitution. So, the expression becomes:

2,000,000 + [b²*(300 - b) + c²*(300 - c)] = 6,000,000.

Thus

---------------

, [b²*(300 - b) + c²*(300 - c)] = 4,000,000.

But

---------------

 since b + c = 200, perhaps I can let b = k, c = 200 - k, and then

---------------

 find k such that:

k²*(300 - k) + (200 -k)^2*(300 - (200 -k)) = 4,000,000.

Simplify the

---------------

 second term:

(200 -k)^2*(300 -200 +k) = (200 -k)^2*(100 +k).

So, the equation becomes:

k²*(300 -k) + (200 -k)^2*(100 +k) = 4,000,000.

Let

---------------

 me expand this:

First term: k²*(300 -k) = 300k² -k^3.

Second term: (200 -k)^2*(100 +k).

---------------

 Let's expand (200 -k)^2 = 40,000 -400k +k².

Multiply by (100 +k):

(40,000 -400k +k²)(100 +k) = 40,000*100 +40,000*k -400k*100 -400k*k +k²*100 +k²*k.

Compute

---------------

 each term:

40,000*100 = 4,000,000


---------------

40,000*k = 40,000k
-400k*100 = -40,000k
-400k*k = -400k²
k²*100 = 100k²
k²*k =k^3

Now

---------------

, combine like terms:

4,000,000 + (40,000k -40,000k) + (-400k² + 100k²) +k^3
= 4,000,000 + 0k + (-300k²) +k^3
= 4,000,000 -300k² +k^3.

So, the second

---------------

 term is 4,000,000 -300k² +k^3.

Now, the

---------------

 entire equation becomes:

(300k² -k^3) + (4,000,000 -300k² +k^3) = 4,000,000.

Simplify:

300k² -k^3 +4,000,000 -300k² +k^3 = 4,000,000.

The

---------------

 terms 300k² and -300k² cancel out, and -k^3 +k^3 canc

---------------

els out. So, we're left with 4,000,000 =4,000,000.



---------------

Hmm, that's an identity, which means that for any k, the equation holds as long as a=100, b=k, c=200 -k. Wait

---------------

, but that can't be right because earlier when I tried a=100, b=100, c=100, the

---------------

 expression was 6,000,000, but when I tried a=100, b=150, c=50, it

---------------

 worked as well. So, perhaps for a=100, any b and c that sum to 200 will

---------------

 satisfy the second condition? That seems to be the case from the equation above.

Wait, that's strange because when I tried

---------------

 a=100, b=150, c=50, it worked, but when I tried a=100, b=100, c=100, it also worked. But

---------------

 when I tried a=100, b=120, c=80, it didn't add up to

---------------

 6,000,000. Wait, but according to this equation, it should.

Wait, no

---------------

, that can't be. Let me check that again. When I set a=100, and b + c=200, the

---------------

 equation reduces to an identity, which suggests that any such triple would satisfy the condition. But that contradicts my earlier test where a=100, b=120, c=80 didn

---------------

't add up to 6,000,000. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations

---------------

.

Wait, let me try a=100, b=120, c=80 again.

Compute the expression:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

a

---------------

=100, so:

100²*120 = 10,000 * 120 = 1,200,000
100²*80 = 10,000 *80 = 800,000
b²a = 120² * 100 = 14,400 * 100 = 1,440,000
b²c = 14,400 *80 = 1,152,000
c²a =80² *100 = 6,400 *100 = 640,000
c²b =6,400 *120 = 768,000

Now, sum

---------------

 them up:

1,200,000 + 800,000 = 2,000,000
1,440,000 + 1,152,000 = 2,592,000
640,000 + 768,000 = 1,408,000

Total sum: 2,000,000 + 2,592,000 = 4,592,000 + 1,408,000 = 6,000,000.

Wait, that

---------------

 actually adds up to 6,000,000. So, that triple (100, 120, 80) is

---------------

 also a solution. So, this suggests that when a=100, any b and c that sum to 200 will satisfy the second

---------------

 condition. So, that's a whole family of solutions where a=100, and b + c=200,

---------------

 with b and c being any nonnegative integers adding up to 200.

Wait, but then that would mean that

---------------

 there are infinitely many solutions, which can't be right because the problem states that a, b, c are nonnegative integers,

---------------

 but it's expecting a finite number of triples. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, no, let

---------------

 me think again. When a=100, then b + c=200, and the expression reduces to 

---------------

2,000,000 + [b²*(300 - b) + c²*(300 - c)] = 6,000,000.

---------------

 But from earlier substitution, that expression simplifies to an identity, meaning that any b and c summing to 200 would work. So

---------------

, that suggests that any triple where a=100 and b + c=200 is a solution.

But

---------------

 that can't be correct because when I tried a=100, b=100, c=100, it

---------------

 worked, but when I tried a=100, b=200, c=0, it worked as well. But

---------------

 then, when I tried a=100, b=150, c=50, it worked,

---------------

 and a=100, b=120, c=80, it worked too. So, that

---------------

 suggests that any triple where a=100 and b + c=200 is a solution. So, how

---------------

 many such triples are there?

Well, since a=100, and b + c=200, the

---------------

 number of nonnegative integer solutions is 201 (from b=0 to b=200, with c=200 - b). But

---------------

 wait, but the problem is asking for triples (a, b, c), so each of these would be a distinct solution,

---------------

 right? But that would mean 201 solutions just from a=100, which is a lot. But earlier

---------------

, I found that (150, 100, 50) is a solution, but in that case, a=150, which

---------------

 is different.

Wait, no, in that case, a=150, so that's a different scenario. So

---------------

, perhaps the only solutions are those where a=100, and b + c=200, which would give 201 solutions, plus the permutations

---------------

 of (200, 100, 0), which are 6, plus the triple (100,100,100). Wait, but wait

---------------

, when a=100, b=100, c=100, that's included in the a

---------------

=100 case because b + c=200, but in that case, b=100, c=100,

---------------

 which is allowed. So, that's one of the 201 solutions.

But wait, earlier when I tried a=100, b=10

---------------

0, c=100, it worked. And when a=100, b=200, c=0, it worked,

---------------

 giving 6,000,000. So, that suggests that all triples where a=100 and b + c=200 are valid solutions

---------------

. So, that's 201 solutions. But that seems too many, and the problem is asking for the number of triples, which

---------------

 is likely to be a small number, so perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I should double

---------------

-check the substitution when a=100.

When a=100, the expression becomes:

100²b

---------------

 + 100²c + b²*100 + b²c + c²*100 + c²b.

Which

---------------

 is 10,000b + 10,000c + 100b² + 100c² + 100c² + c²b.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I made a mistake in the earlier substitution. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, the expression is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

So

---------------

, substituting a=100, we get:

100²b + 100²c + b²*100 + b²c + c²*100 + c²b.

Which is 10,000b + 10,000c + 100b² + b²c + 100c² + c²b.

Wait

---------------

, but when I set a=100, and b + c=200, then the expression becomes:

10,000b

---------------

 + 10,000c + 100b² + b²c + 100c² + c²b.

Now

---------------

, let me compute this for a=100, b=100, c=100:

10,000*100 +10,000*100 +100*(100)^2 + (100)^2*100 +100*(100)^2 + (100)^2*100.

Which

---------------

 is 1,000,000 +1,000,000 + 100*10,000 + 10,000*100 + 100*10,000 + 10,000*100.

Wait

---------------

, that's 1,000,000 +1,000,000 = 2,000,000.



---------------

Then, 100*10,000=1,000,000, and

---------------

 10,000*100=1,000,000, so two terms

---------------

 of 1,000,000 each, totaling 2,000,000.

Similarly

---------------

, the other two terms: 100*10,000=1,000,000 and 10,000*100=1,000,000, totaling

---------------

 another 2,000,000.

So, total sum is 2,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 6,000,000. That

---------------

 works.

Now, let's try a=100, b=200, c=0:

10,000*200 +10,000*0 +100*(200)^2 + (200)^2*0 +100*(0)^2 +0^2*200.

Which

---------------

 is 2,000,000 +0 +100*40,000 +0 +0 +0.

So

---------------

, 2,000,000 +4,000,000 =6,000,000. That works.

Now

---------------

, let me try a=100, b=150, c=50:

10,000*150 +10,000*50 +100*(150)^2 + (150)^2*50 +100*(50)^2 +50^2*150.

Compute each term:

10,000*150 =1,500,000
10,000*50=500,000
100*(22500)=2,250,000
22500*50=1,125,000
100*(2500)=250,000
2500*150=375,000

Now

---------------

, sum all:

1,500,000 +500,000 =2,000,000
2,250,000 +1,125,000 =3,375,000
250,000 +375,000 =625,000

Total: 2,000,000 +3,375,000 =5,375,000 +625,000=6,000,000. That

---------------

 works.

Hmm, so it seems that whenever a=100, and b + c=200, the expression equals

---------------

 6,000,000. So, that suggests that all such triples are valid solutions. So, how

---------------

 many such triples are there?

Since a=100, and b + c=200, the number of nonnegative integer solutions is 201 (

---------------

from b=0 to b=200). Each of these would be a distinct triple (100, b, 200 - b).

---------------

 So, that's 201 solutions.

But wait, earlier I found that (150, 100, 50) is a solution, which is

---------------

 not covered by a=100. So, that suggests that there are other solutions where a≠100.

---------------

 So, how can that be?

Wait, let me check the earlier substitution again. When I set a=100, and

---------------

 found that any b and c summing to 200 works, but when I set a=150, and

---------------

 found that (150,100,50) is a solution, that suggests that there are other solutions where

---------------

 a≠100.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier analysis when I set a=100.

---------------

 Let me check again.

When a=100, the expression becomes:

100²b + 100²c + b²*100 + b²c + c²*100 + c²b.

Which

---------------

 simplifies to:

10,000b +10,000c +100b² +b²c +100c² +c²b.

Now

---------------

, since b + c=200, let me let c=200 -b. Substitute that into the expression:

10,000b +10,000*(200 -b) +100b² +b²*(200 -b) +100*(200 -b)^2 + (200 -b)^2 *b.

S

---------------

implify term by term:

10,000b + 2,000,000 -10,000b = 2,000,000.

100b² +

---------------

 b²*(200 -b) = 100b² + 200b² -b^3 = 300b² -b^3.

100*(200 -b)^2 =100*(40,000 -400b +b²) =4,000,000 -40,000b +100b².

(200 -b)^2 *b = (40,000 -400b +b²)*b =40,000b -400b² +b^3.

Now, sum

---------------

 all terms:

2,000,000 + (300b² -b^3) + (4,000,000 -40,000b +100b²) + (40,000b -400b² +b^3).

Combine

---------------

 like terms:

2,000,000 +4,000,000 =6,000,000.

3

---------------

00b² +100b² -400b² =0.

-b^3 +b^3=0.

-40,000b +40,000b=0.

So, everything

---------------

 cancels out, leaving 6,000,000. So, yes, for any a=100 and b + c=200, the expression equals 6,000,000. So

---------------

, that's 201 solutions.

But then, earlier, I found that (150,100,50) is also a solution, which isn

---------------

't covered by a=100. So, that suggests that there are other solutions outside of a=100.

---------------

 So, perhaps the total number of solutions is 201 (from a=100) plus the solutions from other a

---------------

's, like a=150, etc.

Wait, but when I tried a=150, b=100, c=50, that

---------------

 worked, but what about other a's? Let me see.

Wait, but perhaps I can think of the problem in a different way. The

---------------

 expression a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b can be rewritten

---------------

 as ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c). But since a + b + c=300, then

---------------

 a + b=300 -c, a + c=300 -b, and b + c=300 -a. So, the expression becomes:

ab*(300 -c) + ac*(300 -b) + bc*(300 -a).

Which

---------------

 is equal to 300(ab + ac + bc) - (abc + abc + abc) = 300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc.

So, the expression

---------------

 is 300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc =6,000,000.

So

---------------

, 300(ab + ac + bc) -3abc =6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc =2,000,000.

So

---------------

, the equation becomes:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc =2,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 this form is easier to work with. Let me write that:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc =2,000,000.

Let

---------------

 me rearrange it:

abc -100(ab + ac + bc) = -2,000,000.

Hmm

---------------

, that might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor it differently.

Alternatively, let me think of this as:

abc =100(ab + ac + bc) -2,000,000.

But

---------------

 I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the equation as:

abc =100(ab + ac + bc) -2,000,000.

Hmm

---------------

, perhaps I can factor out ab + ac + bc, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider

---------------

 the equation:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc =2,000,000.

Let

---------------

 me factor 100 out:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc =2,000,000.

Hmm

---------------

, perhaps I can write this as:

abc -100(ab + ac + bc) = -2,000,000.

But

---------------

 I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the equation as:

abc -100(ab + ac + bc) +2,000,000 =0.

But

---------------

 I'm not sure how to proceed from here.

Wait, perhaps I can try substituting specific values for a, b, c.

---------------

 For example, when a=100, we saw that any b + c=200 works. So, that

---------------

 gives 201 solutions. Now, when a=150, b=100, c=50 works. Let

---------------

 me see if other values of a can give solutions.

Wait, perhaps I can find a general solution. Let me suppose that one

---------------

 of the variables is 100, say a=100, then as before, any b + c=200 works. Similarly

---------------

, if b=100, then a + c=200, and if c=100, then a + b=200. So, each

---------------

 of these cases would give 201 solutions, but we have to be careful not to double-count the cases where two variables are 100,

---------------

 like (100,100,100), which is counted in all three cases.

Wait, but in

---------------

 reality, when a=100, b + c=200, which includes the case where b=100 and c=100. Similarly, when b=100, a + c=200, which includes a=100 and c=100. So, the

---------------

 total number of solutions where at least one variable is 100 would be 3*201 - 3*(1

---------------

) + 1. Wait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the number of solutions where a

---------------

=100, plus those where a≠100 but the equation holds.

Wait, but from earlier, when

---------------

 a=100, there are 201 solutions. Now, when a≠100, like a=150, we

---------------

 found that (150,100,50) is a solution. So, perhaps there are other solutions where none of the variables are 100.



---------------

Wait, let me try to find another solution where none of a, b, c is 100. Let me suppose

---------------

 that a=120, b=80, c=100. Wait, but c=100,

---------------

 which we've already considered. Alternatively, let me try a=120, b=90, c=90. Let

---------------

's check if that works.

Sum:120+90+90=300.

Compute the expression:

120²*90 +120²*90 +90²*120 +90²*90 +90²*120 +90²*90.

Compute

---------------

 each term:

120²=14,400. So, 14,400*90=1,296,000. Two

---------------

 of these: 2,592,000.

90²=8,100. 8,100*120=972,000. Two of these: 1,944,000.

8,100*90=729,000. Two of these: 1,458,000.

Total

---------------

 sum:2,592,000 +1,944,000=4,536,000 +1,458,000=5,994,000. That

---------------

's 6,000,000 -6,000. So, not quite. So, that's not a solution.

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 another approach. Let me think about the equation:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc =2,000,000.

Let

---------------

 me write this as:

abc -100(ab + ac + bc) = -2,000,000.

Hmm

---------------

, perhaps I can factor this as:

abc -100(ab + ac + bc) = -2,000,000.

Hmm

---------------

, maybe I can factor it as:

abc -100ab -100ac -100bc = -2,000,000.

Hmm

---------------

, perhaps adding 10000 to both sides would help, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor

---------------

 it as:

( a -100 )( b -100 )( c -100 ) = something.

Wait, let me try expanding

---------------

 (a -100)(b -100)(c -100):

= abc -100ab -100ac -100bc +10,000a +10,000b +10,000c -1,000,000.

Hmm, that

---------------

's similar to our equation. Let me compare:

We have:

abc -100ab -100ac -100bc = -2,000,000.

So

---------------

, from the expansion:

(a -100)(b -100)(c -100) = abc -100ab -100ac -100bc +10,000a +10,000b +10,000c -1,000,000.

But

---------------

 our equation is:

abc -100ab -100ac -100bc = -2,000,000.

So, substit

---------------

uting:

(a -100)(b -100)(c -100) = (-2,000,000) +10,000(a + b + c) -1,000,000.

But a

---------------

 + b + c=300, so:

= (-2,000,000) +10,000*300 -1,000,000


---------------

= (-2,000,000) +3,000,000 -1,000,000
= 0.

So, (a -100)(b -100)(c -100) =0.

Which

---------------

 implies that at least one of the factors is zero. So, either a=100, or b=100, or c=100.

Ah

---------------

! So, this means that any solution must have at least one of the variables equal to 100. So, all

---------------

 solutions must have a=100, or b=100, or c=100.

That's

---------------

 a crucial insight. So, the only solutions are those where at least one variable is 100. So, that

---------------

 means that the earlier case where a=150, b=100, c=50 is a solution because b=100. Similarly, the

---------------

 case where a=100, b=150, c=50 is a solution because a=100. So, all

---------------

 solutions must have at least one variable equal to 100.

So, that means that the only possible solutions are the

---------------

 ones where one of the variables is 100, and the other two sum to 200. So, that

---------------

's the 201 solutions where a=100, plus the 201 solutions where b=100, and the 201 solutions where c=100. But wait, that

---------------

 would count some solutions multiple times. For example, the solution (100,100,100) would be counted in all three cases.

---------------

 So, we need to account for overlaps.

Wait, but according to the equation (a-100)(b-100)(c-100)=0, any

---------------

 solution must have at least one variable equal to 100. So, all solutions are covered by cases where a=100, or b=100, or c=100. So

---------------

, the total number of solutions is the number of triples where a=100, plus the number where b=100, plus the number where c=100, minus the overlaps where two variables are 100, plus the solution

---------------

 where all three are 100.

So, let's compute that.

Number of solutions where a=100: 

---------------

201 (since b + c=200).

Similarly, number where b=100: 201.

Number where c=100:201.

Now, the

---------------

 overlaps where two variables are 100:

- a=100 and b=100: Then c=300 -1

---------------

00 -100=100. So, only one solution: (100,100,100).

Similarly, a=100 and c=100: same

---------------

 as above.

And b=100 and c=100: same as above.

So, each pair contributes

---------------

 one solution, but all three being 100 is the same solution.

So, the total number of solutions is:

3

---------------

*201 - 3*1 +1 = 603 -3 +1=601.

Wait, that

---------------

's 3*201=603, minus 3*1=3 (for the overlaps where two variables are 100, each

---------------

 counted twice), plus 1 for the solution where all three are 100, which was subtracted too many times.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the inclusion-exclusion principle should be applied here.

Total solutions = (number where a=100) + (number where b=100) + (number where c=100) - (number where a=100 and b=100) - (number where a=100 and c=100) - (number where b=100 and c=100) + (number where a=100 and b=100 and c=100).

So

---------------

, substituting:

= 201 +201 +201 -1 -1 -1 +1.



---------------

Compute:

201*3=603.

Then, subtract 1 three times: 603 -3=600.

Add 1: 600 +1=601.

So, the total number of solutions is 601.

Wait, but earlier

---------------

 I found that (150,100,50) is a solution where b=100, which

---------------

 is included in the 201 solutions where b=100. Similarly, (100,150,50) is included in a=100.

---------------

 So, this seems to align.

But wait, earlier when I thought that a=100 gives 201 solutions, and

---------------

 similarly for b=100 and c=100, each giving 201, but with overlaps,

---------------

 the total is 601. So, that's the number of solutions.

But let me verify this. For example, the

---------------

 solution (100,100,100) is counted once in each of a=100, b=100, c=100, so in

---------------

 the inclusion-exclusion, it's added three times, then subtracted three times for the overlaps, and then added once,

---------------

 so it's counted once in total, which is correct.

Similarly, a solution like (100,150,50) is only counted in a=100, and

---------------

 not in b=100 or c=100, so it's correctly included once.

Similarly, a solution where b

---------------

=100, like (150,100,50), is counted in b=100,

---------------

 and not elsewhere.

So, the total number of solutions is 601.

But wait, earlier I thought that when

---------------

 a=100, any b + c=200 works, giving 201 solutions, but when

---------------

 I tried a=100, b=120, c=80, the expression worked. So, that

---------------

's consistent.

But then, when I considered the case where a=150, b=100, c=50, that's included

---------------

 in the b=100 case, which gives 201 solutions, so it's already counted.

So, according

---------------

 to this, the total number of solutions is 601.

Wait, but let me think again. When a=100, b

---------------

 can be from 0 to 200, giving 201 solutions. Similarly, when b=100, a can be from 0 to 200, giving

---------------

 201 solutions. But some of these solutions overlap, like when a=100 and b=100, which is

---------------

 the solution (100,100,100). So, using inclusion-exclusion, we get 601 solutions.

But

---------------

 wait, the problem is asking for the number of triples (a, b, c) where a, b, c are nonnegative integers.

---------------

 So, according to this analysis, the answer should be 601.

But wait, earlier I thought that (150,100,50) is a solution, and

---------------

 it's included in the b=100 case, so it's counted in the 601.

But let

---------------

 me check another case where a=200, b=100, c=0. That's a solution where

---------------

 a=200, which is not covered by a=100, but according to our earlier analysis, all

---------------

 solutions must have at least one variable equal to 100. But in this case, b=100, so it is covered by

---------------

 the b=100 case. So, that's included in the 601 solutions.

Similarly, the solution (100, 

---------------

200, 0) is included in a=100.

So, all the solutions we found earlier are included in the 601 count

---------------

.

Therefore, the total number of triples is 601.


The number of triples is calculated by considering all cases where at least one variable equals 100, leading

---------------

 to a total of 601 solutions.
