Alright, let me try to tackle this geometry problem. It's about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH, with some points collinear and others

---------------

 lying on a circle. I need to find the length of CE. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, let

---------------

's visualize the problem. We have two rectangles: ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, these

---------------

 four points lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. That

---------------

 means these four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. 

Given dimensions: BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. We

---------------

 need to find CE.

Let me sketch this mentally. Rectangle ABCD: so AB and CD are the lengths, and BC and AD are the widths. Similarly

---------------

, rectangle EFGH has EF and GH as lengths, FG and EH as widths.

Wait, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So,

---------------

 in ABCD, AB=CD=107, BC=AD=16. In EFGH, EF=GH=184, FG=EH=17.

Now

---------------

, points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, E is somewhere between D and C, or maybe

---------------

 C is between E and F? Hmm, not sure yet. Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle.

Let

---------------

 me think about the positions. Rectangle ABCD: Let's consider the points in order. Let's say ABCD is arranged

---------------

 so that AB is the base, BC is the height. So, points are A, B, C, D in order, making

---------------

 a rectangle. Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle, perhaps placed such that E is connected to F and G, etc

---------------

.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, I think the line passes through D, then E, then C, then F. Or

---------------

 maybe another order? Let me think. If D is a corner of the first rectangle, and E is a corner of the second, perhaps

---------------

 E is next to D on the line. So, the line could be DC, but E and F are on it as

---------------

 well.

Wait, but in rectangle ABCD, the sides are AB=107 and BC=16. So, the

---------------

 rectangle is longer along AB. Similarly, EFGH has EF=184 and FG=17, so it

---------------

's longer along EF.

Given that D, E, C, F are collinear, I think the line is DC extended

---------------

 with E and F on it.

Wait, but in rectangle ABCD, points are A, B, C, D.

---------------

 So, D is adjacent to C. So, if I extend DC, I might have points E and F on that line.

---------------

 So, E is somewhere on DC beyond C, or maybe between D and C? Hmm, but the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear.

---------------

 So, perhaps the order is D, E, C, F along the line.

Alternatively, maybe it's D, C, E, F?

---------------

 Wait, that would make more sense if C is between D and E, but since ABCD is a rectangle, D and C are adjacent.

---------------

 So, maybe E is beyond C on the DC line, and F is further beyond E.

Wait, but I'm not sure

---------------

. Let me try to sketch it.

Let me imagine ABCD as a rectangle with AB=107 (horizontal) and BC=16 (vertical). So, point

---------------

 A is at (0,0), B at (107,0), C at (107,16), D at (0,16). Wait

---------------

, no, that would make AD vertical, but in that case, D is at (0,16), C at (107,16), B

---------------

 at (107,0), and A at (0,0). So, DC is the top side from D(0,16) to C(107,16). 



---------------

Now, EFGH is another rectangle. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, and assuming the line is DC,

---------------

 which is horizontal at y=16. So, E and F must lie on this line.

Wait, but if E

---------------

 and F are on DC, which is a side of ABCD, then where is EFGH? Maybe EFGH is placed

---------------

 such that E is a point on DC, and F is another point on DC. So, EFGH would have sides

---------------

 EF and FG. Since EF=184, which is much longer than DC, which is 107 units

---------------

 long. Hmm, but DC is only 107 units. So, EF can't be on DC. Therefore, maybe

---------------

 the line D, E, C, F isn't DC, but another line.

Wait, maybe D, E, C, F are col

---------------

inear on a different line, not DC. Since in rectangle ABCD, D is at (0,16), and C is at (107,16). So, the

---------------

 line DC is horizontal. But if E and F are also on this line, then EFGH would have EF=184,

---------------

 which is longer than DC. That might not make sense because DC is only 107.

Alternatively, perhaps the line is

---------------

 not DC but another line. Maybe a vertical line or some other line passing through D and C. Wait, but in that

---------------

 case, D and C are diagonal points? No, D and C are adjacent in the rectangle, so they can't be diagonal.

---------------

 Wait, no, in a rectangle, D and C are adjacent, so they are connected by a side, which is DC,

---------------

 which is 107 units long.

Hmm, perhaps I need to reorient the rectangles. Maybe ABCD is not

---------------

 in the way I placed it. Maybe AB is vertical, BC is horizontal. Let me try that. Let's say point

---------------

 A is at (0,0), B at (0,107), C at (16,107), and D at (16,0). So

---------------

, ABCD is a rectangle with AB=107 (vertical) and BC=16 (horizontal). Then, DC is from (16,107) to (16,0),

---------------

 which is vertical. So, D is at (16,0), C at (16,107). 



---------------

Wait, but then D and C are on a vertical line x=16. So, if E and F are on

---------------

 that line, then EFGH would have E and F on x=16. But EF=184,

---------------

 which is longer than DC=107. So, EFGH's side EF would be 184,

---------------

 which is longer than DC. But where would that place E and F? If E is at (16, y), then

---------------

 F would be at (16, y+184) or (16, y-184). Hmm

---------------

, but if E is on DC, which goes from (16,0) to (16,107), then F

---------------

 would be outside of DC.

Wait, but in this arrangement, D is at (16,0), so E would

---------------

 be somewhere on DC, maybe beyond C. So, E is at (16,107 + something), and

---------------

 F would be further up. Hmm, but then EFGH is another rectangle. So, if E is at (16,1

---------------

07 + a), then F would be at (16,107 + a +184) because

---------------

 EF=184. Wait, but FG=17, so from F, moving 17 units in some direction to

---------------

 get to G, and then from G to H, and then back to E.

But this might not align with the other

---------------

 rectangle. I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should try a different approach.

We also know that points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, these

---------------

 four points are concyclic. That suggests that quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. So, the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral sum to 180 degrees. Maybe

---------------

 I can use that property.

But first, perhaps I should assign coordinates to all the points to make this easier. Let me try

---------------

 that.

Let me place rectangle ABCD such that point A is at (0,0), B is at (107,0), C at (107,16), and D at (0,16). So, ABC

---------------

D has AB=107, BC=16.

Now, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. So

---------------

, D is at (0,16), C is at (107,16). So, the line DC is the

---------------

 line y=16, from (0,16) to (107,16). So, E

---------------

 and F must lie on this line.

But wait, rectangle EFGH has EF=184. Since EF is a side of the rectangle, which

---------------

 is supposed to be on the line y=16. So, E and F are on this line, 184 units apart.

But

---------------

 the length DC is 107 units, so how can E and F be 184 units apart on this

---------------

 line? Maybe E is beyond D and F is beyond C? Or the other way around.

Wait, if E is to

---------------

 the left of D, then F would be 184 units to the right of E. Since D is at (0,16), E

---------------

 could be at (-a,16), and F would be at (-a +184,16). Similarly

---------------

, if E is beyond C, then E is at (107 + b,16), and F is at (107 + b -184,16).

---------------

 Hmm, but in both cases, F would be beyond C or beyond D.

But we also have that points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. Let

---------------

's think about that.

Point A is (0,0), D is (0,16), H and G are points from rectangle EFGH. Let

---------------

 me assign coordinates to E, F, G, H.

Since EFGH is a rectangle, and E and F are on y=16,

---------------

 then the other points G and H must be either above or below this line.

Let me assume that rectangle EFGH is above

---------------

 the line y=16. So, from E, moving up 17 units (since FG=17) to get

---------------

 to G, and from F, moving up 17 units to get to H.

Wait, no, in a rectangle, opposite

---------------

 sides are equal. So, if EF is the base, then FG is the height. So, from E, moving up

---------------

 17 units to G, and from F, moving up 17 units to H. Then, G and H would

---------------

 be connected by GH, which is equal to EF=184.

So, if E is at (e,16), then F is at (e + 184,16). Then, G would be at (e,16 +17)

---------------

 = (e,33), and H would be at (e +184, 33). So, the

---------------

 rectangle EFGH has points E(e,16), F(e+184,16), G(e,33), H(e+184,33).

Now

---------------

, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, A is (0,0), D is (0,16), G is (e,33), H is (e+184,33).

Wait

---------------

, four points lie on a circle. So, we can use the condition for concyclic points.

The general equation of a circle is x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0. Since

---------------

 points A, D, G, H lie on this circle, substituting their coordinates into the equation will give us equations to solve for g, f, c, and e

---------------

.

Let me plug in each point:

1. Point A: (0,0) → 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + c = 0 → c = 0.

So, the equation simplifies to x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy = 0.

2. Point D: (0,16) → 0 + (16)^2 + 0 + 2f*(

---------------

16) = 0 → 256 + 32f = 0 → 32f = -256 → f = -8.

So now, the equation is x² + y² + 2gx -16y = 0.

3. Point G: (e,33) → e² + (33)^2 + 2g*e -16*33 = 0 → e² + 1089 + 2g e -528 = 0 → e² + 2g e + 561 = 0.

4. Point H: (e+184,33) → (e+184)^2 + (33)^2 + 2g*(e+184) -16*33 = 0.

Let

---------------

 me compute this:

(e+184)^2 = e² + 368e + (184)^2 = e² + 368e + 33856.

So

---------------

, substituting:

(e² + 368e + 33856) + 1089 + 2g(e+184) -528 = 0.

Simplify:

e² + 368e + 33856 + 1089 -528 + 2g e + 368g = 0.

Combine

---------------

 like terms:

e² + (368e + 2g e) + (33856 + 1089 -528) + 368g = 0.

Compute

---------------

 constants: 33856 + 1089 = 34945; 34945 -528 = 34417.

So,

---------------

 equation becomes:

e² + e(368 + 2g) + 34417 + 368g = 0.

Now, from point G's equation,

---------------

 we have:

e² + 2g e + 561 = 0. Let's call this equation (1

---------------

).

From point H's equation, we have:

e² + (368 + 2g)e + 34417 + 368g = 0. Let's call this equation (2).

Now, subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

[e² + (368 + 2g)e + 34417 + 368g] - [e² + 2g e + 561] = 0 - 0.

Simplify:

e² - e² + (368 + 2g)e - 2g e + 34417 + 368g -561 = 0.

This

---------------

 simplifies to:

368 e + (34417 -561) + 368g = 0.

Compute constants: 34417 -561 = 33856.

So:



---------------

368e + 33856 + 368g = 0.

Divide both sides by 368:

e + (33856 / 368) + g = 0.

Compute 33856 / 368:

---------------

 Let's divide numerator and denominator by 16: 33856 ÷16=2116, 368 ÷16=23. So, 2116 /23 =

---------------

 92. So, 33856 /368=92.

So, equation becomes:

e + 92 + g = 0 → e + g = -92. Let's call this equation (3).

From equation (1): e² + 2g e + 561 = 0.

But

---------------

 from equation (3), g = -92 - e. Substitute into equation (1):

e² + 2*(-92 - e)*e + 561 = 0.

Compute

---------------

:

e² - 184 e - 2e² + 561 = 0.

Combine like terms:

-e

---------------

² -184e + 561 = 0 → Multiply both sides by -1:

e² + 184e -561 = 0.

Now

---------------

, solve for e using quadratic formula:

e = [-184 ± sqrt(184^2 -4*1*(-561))]/(2*1).

Compute discriminant:

184^2 = (180 +4)^2 = 180² + 2*180*4 +4² = 32400 + 1440 +16=33856.

4*1*(-561)= -2244.



---------------

So, discriminant D=33856 + 2244= 36100.

sqrt(36100)=190.

So, e = [ -184 ±190 ] / 2.

First

---------------

 solution: (-184 +190)/2=6/2=3.

Second solution: (-184 -190)/2=(-374)/2=-187.

So, e=3 or e=-187.

So

---------------

, two possibilities: e=3 or e=-187.

Now, let's think about the position of E.

---------------

 In the initial setup, E is on the line DC, which is from D(0,16) to C(107,16). So

---------------

, E should lie on this line. But if e=3, then E is at (3,16), which is between D(0,16) and C(107,16). That

---------------

 makes sense.

If e=-187, then E is at (-187,16), which is far

---------------

 to the left of D(0,16). But in that case, F would be at e +184= -187 +184= -3. So, F is

---------------

 at (-3,16), which is to the left of E. But in that case, points D(0,16), E(-187,16), C(107,16), F(-3,16) would

---------------

 be collinear, but the order would be E(-187), F(-3), D(0), C(107) along the line. So

---------------

, D is between F and C, which might not make sense for the rectangle EFGH.

Wait, but in the

---------------

 problem statement, it's said that D, E, C, F are collinear. So, their order could be D

---------------

, E, C, F or any other order as long as they are on the same line. So, if e=-187, E

---------------

 is at (-187,16), F is at (-187 +184= -3,16). So, the

---------------

 order would be E(-187), F(-3), D(0), C(107) along the line y=16. So, D

---------------

 is between F and C, which is possible.

But let's see if both solutions are valid. Let's check each case.

Case 1: e=3.

Then, from

---------------

 equation (3), g = -92 -3= -95.

So, the circle equation is x² + y² + 2*(-95)x -16y =0 → x² + y² -190x -16y =0.

We

---------------

 can check if points G and H lie on this circle.

Point G is (e,33) = (3,33).

Sub

---------------

stitute into circle equation:

3² +33² -190*3 -16*33 = 9 + 1089 -570 -528.

Compute: 9 +1089=1098; 570 +528=1098.

So, 1098 -1098=0. Yes

---------------

, it satisfies.

Point H is (e+184,33)= (187,33).

Substitute into equation:

187² +33² -190*187 -16*33.

Compute:



---------------

187²=34969; 33²=1089.

190*187= 

---------------

190*(180 +7)=190*180=34200 +190*7=1330 → total

---------------

 34200+1330=35530.

16*33=528.

So, equation

---------------

 becomes: 34969 +1089 -35530 -528.

Compute:



---------------

34969 +1089=36058.

35530 +528=36058.

So, 36058 -36058=0. Yes

---------------

, it satisfies.

So, case e=3 is valid.

Case 2: e=-187.

Then, g= -92 - (-187)= -

---------------

92 +187=95.

So, circle equation is x² + y² + 2*95 x -16 y=0 → x² + y² +190x -16y=0.

Check point G: (e,33)= (-187,33).

Substitute into

---------------

 equation:

(-187)^2 +33^2 +190*(-187) -16*33.

Compute:

187²=34969; 33²=1089.

190*(-187)= -190*187= -

---------------

35530.

16*33=528.

So, equation becomes: 34969 +1089 -35530 -528.

Compute

---------------

:

34969 +1089=36058.

35530 +528=36058.

So, 36058 -36058=0. So

---------------

, point G is on the circle.

Point H: (e+184,33)= (-187 +184,33)= (-3,33).

Substitute into equation:

(-3)^2 +33^2 +190*(-3) -16*33.

Compute:

9 +1089=

---------------

1098.

190*(-3)= -570.

16*33=528.

So, equation becomes: 1098 -570 -528=

---------------

 1098 -1098=0. So, point H is on the circle.

So, both cases are valid. Therefore

---------------

, there are two possible positions for E and F: one to the right of D, and one to the left.

Now, we

---------------

 need to find the length of CE.

Point C is at (107,16).

Case 1: e=3.

---------------

 So, E is at (3,16). So, CE is the distance between (107,16) and (3,16).



---------------

Since they are on the same horizontal line, the distance is |107 -3|=104.

Case 2: e=-187. So, E is at (-187,16). Then

---------------

, CE is the distance between (107,16) and (-187,16), which is |107 - (-187)|= |

---------------

394|=394.

But wait, the problem says "what is the length of CE?" without specifying which

---------------

 case. So, perhaps only one case is possible based on the rectangle structure.

Wait, in case e=-187, the

---------------

 rectangle EFGH would have E at (-187,16), F at (-3,16), G at (-187,33), and H at (-3,33). So

---------------

, the rectangle EFGH is placed to the left of D, which is at (0,16). So, points

---------------

 D, E, C, F are collinear on the line y=16, with E at (-187,16), F at (-3,16), D at (0,16), and C at (107,16). So, the

---------------

 order is E, F, D, C on the line.

But the problem states that D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the

---------------

 order might not necessarily be D, E, C, F. It could be any order as long as all four are on the same line. So, both

---------------

 cases are possible.

But the problem is asking for CE. So, in one case, CE is 104, in the other, 394. But

---------------

 which one is it?

Wait, perhaps only one case makes sense in the context of the rectangles being placed such that EFGH is connected

---------------

 correctly. Let me think.

If e=3, then E is between D and C, and F is beyond C.

---------------

 So, E is at (3,16), F at (187,16). Then, the rectangle EFGH would

---------------

 be above the line y=16, from E(3,16) to F(187,16), then

---------------

 up to G(3,33) and H(187,33). Then, point G is at (3,33), which is close

---------------

 to A(0,0). Hmm, but does that affect anything?

Alternatively, if e=-187, E

---------------

 is far to the left, F is at (-3,16), and the rectangle EFGH is also above the

---------------

 line y=16.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the orientation of the rectangles beyond their sides. So, perhaps both are

---------------

 possible. But the length CE can be either 104 or 394. However, the problem likely expects a

---------------

 single answer, so perhaps only one case is valid.

Wait, perhaps when e=-187, the rectangle EFGH would have

---------------

 EF=184, which is longer than DC=107, but since E and F are on the same line,

---------------

 that's acceptable. But perhaps the position of E affects whether A, D, H, G lie on a circle.

Wait, both

---------------

 cases satisfy the circle condition, as we saw earlier. So, both are possible. Hmm, but the problem says "rect

---------------

angles ABCD and EFGH are drawn such that D,E,C,F are collinear." So, perhaps in one case, the rectangles

---------------

 are on the same side of the line DC, and in the other case, they are on opposite sides.

Wait, in

---------------

 case e=3, EFGH is above DC, just like ABCD is below DC. So, both rectangles are on the same side relative

---------------

 to DC. In case e=-187, EFGH is above DC, while ABCD is below. So

---------------

, perhaps both are possible.

But maybe only one of them gives a valid rectangle. Let me think.

Wait, in case

---------------

 e=3, point G is at (3,33), which is above E(3,16). So

---------------

, the rectangle EFGH is placed above the line y=16. Similarly, in case e=-187, G is at (-187,33), which

---------------

 is above E(-187,16).

So, both are possible. So, why would the problem have two

---------------

 possible answers? But the problem asks for the length of CE, so perhaps both are possible, but in the context of the problem, only

---------------

 one makes sense.

Wait, perhaps considering the order of the points. The problem says D, E, C, F are collinear. So, perhaps

---------------

 the order is D, E, C, F along the line.

In case e=3: E is at (3,16), so

---------------

 the order would be D(0,16), E(3,16), C(107,16), F(187,16). So, that

---------------

 fits D, E, C, F in order.

In case e=-187: The points on the line y

---------------

=16 would be E(-187,16), F(-3,16), D(0,16), C(107,16). So, the order is E, F, D, C. But

---------------

 the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear, which doesn't specify the order, just that all four lie on the line. So, both

---------------

 cases are acceptable.

But the length CE in the first case is 104, and in the second case, 394.

Hmm

---------------

, but maybe I made a mistake in assigning the positions. Let me check the problem statement again.

"Rectangles ABCD and EFGH are drawn such that D,E,C,F are collinear.

---------------

 Also, A,D,H,G all lie on a circle."

It doesn't specify the order, just that they are collinear. So, both cases

---------------

 are acceptable. But perhaps in the problem, E is between D and C, making CE=104, which is more

---------------

 reasonable than 394. Alternatively, perhaps only one case makes the points A, D, H, G lie on a circle.



---------------

Wait, but both cases satisfy that condition, as we saw earlier. So, both are possible.

Wait, but perhaps in

---------------

 the problem, the rectangles are drawn such that EFGH is on the same side of DC as ABCD. Since ABCD is below DC, E

---------------

FGH is above DC in both cases. So, both are on the same side. Hmm.

Wait, but in case

---------------

 e=-187, EFGH is far away from ABCD, but still on the same side. So, both

---------------

 are possible.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the minimal length, which is 104. Alternatively, maybe I missed

---------------

 a constraint.

Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle EFGH is drawn such that E is between D and C, making CE=104.

---------------

 Let me think.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "Rectangles ABCD and EFGH are drawn such that D,E,C,F are collinear." So, perhaps

---------------

 E is between D and C, which would make F beyond C. So, in that case, CE would be the distance between C and E, which is 

---------------

107 -3=104.

Alternatively, if E is beyond D, then CE would be 107 +1

---------------

87=294, but wait, that's not matching our previous calculation. Wait, no, in case e=-187, F

---------------

 is at (-3,16), so CE would be |107 - (-187)|=394.

Hmm

---------------

, but without more constraints, it's hard to say. But since the problem is asking for CE, and the two possible values

---------------

 are 104 and 394, perhaps I need to think about the possible lengths.

Wait, in the problem

---------------

, EF=184. So, in case e=3, F is at (3+184,16)=187,16. So

---------------

, the distance from E(3,16) to F(187,16) is 184, which is correct.

In case e=-187, F is at (-187 +184,16)=(-3,16), so the

---------------

 distance from E(-187,16) to F(-3,16) is 184, which is correct.

So, both cases

---------------

 are correct. So, perhaps the answer is 104.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute both and see which one is

---------------

 more plausible.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify any other constraints. So, perhaps both are correct. But the answer is likely

---------------

 104, as it's smaller and more straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the coordinates. Let me try

---------------

 a different approach.

Let me consider the power of a point. Since A, D, H, G lie on a circle, perhaps

---------------

 point C has some relation. Alternatively, since A, D, H, G are concyclic, the power of point C with respect to that

---------------

 circle might be zero.

Wait, the power of point C with respect to the circle is CO² - r² =0, where O is the center.

---------------

 Alternatively, since C lies on the line y=16, which is the same line as D, E, F.

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps using coordinate geometry is the way to go, as I did earlier, but perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the positions

---------------

.

Wait, another approach: Since A, D, H, G lie on a circle, the quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. So, the

---------------

 product of the slopes of AD and AG should satisfy some condition, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, since I have

---------------

 the circle equation and found e=3 and e=-187, and both give valid positions, perhaps the answer is 104.



---------------

But wait, in the problem statement, it says "what is the length of CE?" without specifying further, so perhaps I

---------------

 should consider both possibilities.

Wait, but the problem might have a unique solution, so perhaps I made a mistake in my coordinate

---------------

 assignment.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that EFGH is such that E is between D and C, so E is at

---------------

 (3,16), making CE=107-3=104.

Alternatively, perhaps E is beyond

---------------

 C, making CE=184- something, but no, because EF=184.

Wait, no, EF

---------------

 is the side of the rectangle, so if E is beyond C, then F would be 184 units beyond E,

---------------

 but that might not make sense.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 104. I think I'll go with that.


To solve the problem, we start

---------------

 by assigning coordinates to the points of rectangles \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\). We place rectangle \(ABCD\) with \(A\) at \((0,0)\), \(B\) at \((107,0)\), \(C\) at \((107,16)\), and \(D\) at \((0,16)\). Since

---------------

 \(D\), \(E\), \(C\), and \(F\) are collinear on the line \(y=16\), we denote

---------------

 \(E\) as \((e,16)\) and \(F\) as \((e+184,16)\)

---------------

 because \(EF=184\).

Next, we know that points \(A\), \(D\), \(H\), and \(G\) lie on a circle. Using

---------------

 the general equation of a circle, we substitute the coordinates of these points into the equation to determine the values of \(e\). After solving the system of equations, we find two possible values for \(e\): \(e=3\) and \(e=-187\).

For \(e=3\), point \(E\) is at \((3,16)\), and the

---------------

 length \(CE\) is the horizontal distance between \(C(107,16)\) and \(E(3,16)\), which is \(|107 - 3| = 104\).

For \(e=-187\), point \(E\) is at \((-187,16)\), and the length \(CE\) is the horizontal distance between \(C(107,16)\) and \(E(-187,16)\), which is \(|107 - (-187)| = 394\).

However, considering the problem's context and the typical expectations

---------------

 of such problems, the smaller and more straightforward solution is likely intended. Therefore, the length of \(CE\) is:

\boxed
