Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. The

---------------

 total number of sets Bob lists is 2024. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let's break

---------------

 this down. So, Alice picks set A, and Bob creates all possible finite non-empty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. The number

---------------

 of such B sets is 2024. I have to figure out what A is such that this condition holds, and then sum the

---------------

 elements of A.

First, let's think about what a set B looks like. Each B is a finite, non-empty set of positive integers,

---------------

 and its maximum element is in A. So for each element a in A, how many sets B have maximum element a?

Well

---------------

, if the maximum is a, then the other elements of B must be less than a. So for each a in A, the number of possible subsets

---------------

 B where a is the maximum is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, right

---------------

? Because those subsets can be combined with a to form B. But wait, since B is non-empty, we have to consider

---------------

 that the subset can't be empty because then B would just be {a}, which is allowed. Wait, no, actually

---------------

, the subset can be empty. Because if the subset is empty, then B is just {a}, which is a valid

---------------

 non-empty set. So the number of subsets is 2^{a-1}, because each element less than a can be either included or not.



---------------

So for each a in A, the number of sets B with maximum a is 2^{a-1}. Therefore, the total number of sets Bob lists is the sum over all a in A of 2^{a-1}. So

---------------

, if we let S be the sum over a in A of 2^{a-1}, then S = 2024.

So

---------------

, our equation is:

Sum_{a ∈ A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

Now

---------------

, our task is to find such a set A where this sum equals 2024, and then find the sum of the elements in A.

Let

---------------

 me think about how to approach this. 2024 is the target sum, and each term in the sum is a power of two.

---------------

 Because 2^{a-1} is a power of two for each a. So, perhaps A is a set of

---------------

 integers such that the sum of 2^{a-1} for a in A is 2024. So

---------------

, 2024 can be represented as the sum of distinct powers of two. Wait, but 2^{a-1} are

---------------

 powers of two only if a-1 are unique. So, the set A must consist of numbers a where each a-1 is unique

---------------

, which they are since all a are positive integers, so a-1 are non-negative integers.

Wait, but 2^{a-1} for

---------------

 different a's will be different powers of two only if a-1 are unique. Since a is a positive integer, a

---------------

-1 is a non-negative integer, so each a gives a unique power of two. So, the sum is a sum of distinct powers of two,

---------------

 which is equal to 2024. Therefore, 2024 must be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of two.

---------------

 But 2024 in binary is... let me calculate that.

Let me convert 2024 to binary. 

---------------

2024 divided by 2: 2024 /2 = 1012, remainder 0.

---------------

 1012/2=506, rem 0. 506/2=253, rem 0. 253/2=126 rem 1. 126/2=63 rem 0. 63/2=31 rem 1. 31/2=15 rem 1. 15/2=7 rem 1. 7/2=3 rem 1. 3/2=1 rem 1. 1/2=0 rem 1.

So, writing the remainders from last to first: 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 

---------------

0.

Wait, let's count the bits:

2024 ÷ 2 = 1012,

---------------

 rem 0

1012 ÷2=506, rem 0

506 ÷2=253, rem 0

253 ÷2=126, rem 1

126 ÷2=63, rem 0

63 ÷2=31, rem 1

31 ÷2=15, rem 1

15 ÷2=7, rem 1

7 ÷2=3, rem 1

3 ÷2=1, rem 1

1 ÷2=0, rem 1

So the

---------------

 binary representation is the remainders read from bottom to top: 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0.

Wait, let

---------------

's count the bits:

Starting from the last division:

1st division: rem 1 (LSB)

2nd: 1

3rd: 1

4th: 1

5th: 0

6th: 1

7th: 1

8th: 0

9th: 0

10th: 0

11th: 0

So

---------------

, binary is 111111011000, but wait, let me count the bits

---------------

 correctly. Wait, 2024 is less than 2048 (2^11), so it

---------------

's 11 bits. Let me write it properly:

Let me calculate 2^10 is 1024,

---------------

 2^11 is 2048.

2024 - 1024 = 1000.

---------------

 So 1024 is 2^10, so bit 11 is 1.

1000 left

---------------

. 512 is 2^9. 1000 -512=488. Bit 10 is 1.

488 left

---------------

. 256 is 2^8. 488-256=232. Bit 9 is 1.

232-128=104. 128 is 2^7. Bit 8 is 1.

104-64=40. 64 is 2^6. Bit7 is 1.

40-32=8. 32 is 2^5. Bit6 is 1.

8-

---------------

16 is negative, so bit5 is 0.

8-8=0. 8 is 2^3. Bit4 is 1.

Wait

---------------

, maybe another approach.

Wait, 2024 in binary:

Let me compute 2^0 =1, 2^1=2, 2^2=4, 2^3=8, 2^4=16, 2^5=32, 2^6=64, 2^7=128, 2^8=256, 2^9=512, 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048.

So

---------------

, 2024 is less than 2048, so the highest bit is 1024 (2^10).

2024 -1024 = 1000.

---------------

 So, next, 512 (2^9). 1000 -512=488. So bit

---------------

 9 is 1.

488 -256 (2^8)=232. Bit8 is 1.

232-128 (2^7)=104. Bit7 is1.

104-64 (2^6)=40. Bit6 is1.

40-32 (2^5)=8. Bit5 is1.

8-16 is

---------------

 negative, so bit4 is 0.

8-8 (2^3)=0. Bit3 is1.

So

---------------

, bits set at positions 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

So binary is 11111101000.

Wait, let

---------------

 me write that out:

Position: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

Bits:       

---------------

 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0

So,

---------------

 11111101000.

Wait, that's 11 bits: 1 (

---------------

2^10), 1 (2^9), 1 (2^8), 1 (2^7), 1 (2^6), 1 (2^5), 0 (2^4), 1 (2^3), 0 (2^2), 0 (2^1), 0 (2^0).

So

---------------

, adding up:

2^10 +2^9 +2^8 +2^7 +2^6 +2^5 +2^3 =

---------------

 1024 + 512 +256 +128 +64 +32 +8 =

---------------

 let's compute:

1024 +512 = 1536

1536 +256=1792

1792 +128=1920

1920 +64=1984

1984 +32=2016

2016 +8=2024. Perfect

---------------

.

So, 2024 is equal to the sum of 2^10 +2^9 +2^8 +2^7 +2^6 +2^5 +2^3.

So

---------------

, that is 2^3 +2^5 +2^6 +2^7 +2^8 +2^9 +2^10.

Wait

---------------

, but in our problem, the sum is Sum_{a ∈ A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

So

---------------

, each term 2^{a-1} is a power of two. So, the terms must be distinct powers of two,

---------------

 because 2^{a-1} is unique for each a. So, A must be a set where a-1 corresponds

---------------

 to the exponents in the binary representation of 2024.

Wait, more precisely, since Sum 2^{a-1} = 2024, which

---------------

 is equal to 2^3 +2^5 +2^6 +2^7 +2^8 +2^9 +2^10.

So, each

---------------

 term is 2^{a-1}, so for each term in the sum, a-1 must be one of the

---------------

 exponents in the binary decomposition.

Therefore, a-1 can be 3,5,6,7,8,9,10.

So

---------------

, a = (3+1), (5+1), (6+1), (7+1), (8+1), (9+1), (10+1).



---------------

So, a =4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

So, the set A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Wait

---------------

, let me check: 2^{4-1}=8, 2^{6-1}=32, 2^{7-1}=64, 2^{8-1}=128, 2^{9-1}=256, 2^{10-1}=512, 2^{11-1}=1024.

So

---------------

, sum is 8+32+64+128+256+512+1024.



---------------

Let me compute that:

8 +32=40

40 +64=104

104 +128=232

232 +256=488

488 +512=1000

1000 +1024=2024. Perfect

---------------

.

So, the set A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Therefore

---------------

, the sum of the elements of A is 4+6+7+8+9+10+11.

Let me compute that:

4+6=10

10+7=17

17+8=25

25+9=34

34+10=44

44+11=55.

So, the sum is 55.

Wait

---------------

, is that correct? Let me add them again: 4+6 is 10, plus7 is17, plus8 is25, plus9 is34, plus10 is44, plus11 is55. Yeah

---------------

, that's correct.

So, the sum of the elements of A is 55.


The problem involves Alice choosing a set \( A \) of positive integers.

---------------

 Bob then lists all finite nonempty sets \( B \) of positive integers where the maximum element of \( B \) belongs to \( A \). The total number of such sets \( B \) is 2024. We need to determine the sum of the elements of \( A \).

To

---------------

 solve this, we recognize that for each element \( a \) in \( A \), the number of sets \( B \) with maximum element \( a \) is \( 2^{a-1} \). Therefore, the total number of sets \( B \) is the sum over

---------------

 all \( a \in A \) of \( 2^{a-1} \). This sum equals 2024.



---------------

Expressing 2024 in binary, we find it corresponds to the sum of powers of two: \( 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3 \). Each

---------------

 term \( 2^{a-1} \) must match these powers, implying \( a-1 \) corresponds to the exponents 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Thus, \( A = \{4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\} \).

Summing the elements of \( A \):



---------------

\[
4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55
\]

The

---------------

 sum of the elements of \( A \) is \(\boxed{55}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
