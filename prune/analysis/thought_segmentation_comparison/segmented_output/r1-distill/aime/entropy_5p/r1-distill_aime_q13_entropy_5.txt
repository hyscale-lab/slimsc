Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the greatest four-digit number N with a special property. The property is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, once I find N, I have to divide it by 1000 to get Q and R (quotient and remainder) and then find Q + R.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, N is a four-digit number. So, it's somewhere between 1000 and 9999. I

---------------

'm supposed to find the greatest such number, so I should probably start checking from 9999 downwards until I find one that satisfies the condition.

The condition is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. That means, for each digit in N, if I replace that digit with 1, the new number is a multiple of 7.

Let me think

---------------

 about what that implies. Suppose N has digits A, B, C, D. So, N = ABCD in four digits. If I change A to 1, I

---------------

 get 1BCD, and that should be divisible by 7. Similarly, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, which should be divisible by 7. The same goes for changing C to 1 (AB1D) and D to 1 (ABC1). So all four of

---------------

 these modified numbers must be divisible by 7.

Wait, but if I change a digit to 1, it's possible that the digit was already 1. In

---------------

 that case, changing it to 1 again doesn't change the number. So, if any digit of N is 1, then changing

---------------

 it to 1 doesn't affect the number, so N itself must be divisible by 7. But wait, the problem says that when you

---------------

 change one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. So if a digit is already 1, then N is already

---------------

 divisible by 7. But for other digits, changing them to 1 must also result in a number divisible by 7.

But

---------------

 wait, N could have multiple 1s. For example, if N is 1111, then changing any digit to 1 doesn't change the number, so N

---------------

 must be divisible by 7. But 1111 divided by 7 is 158.714..., which isn't an integer. So 1111 wouldn't work. So

---------------

, N can't have all digits as 1.

But perhaps N has some 1s and some other digits. Let

---------------

 me consider the implications for each digit.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number, so N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits from 0 to 9, and a is at least 1 since it's a four-digit number.

Now, when

---------------

 we change a to 1, the number becomes 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d. So

---------------

 1000 + 100b + 10c + d must be divisible by 7.

Similarly, changing b to 1 gives a*1000 + 100*1 + 10c + d, which is 1000a + 100 + 10c + d, and this must be divisible by 7.

Changing c to 1 gives a*1000 + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d, which must be divisible by 7.

Changing d to 1 gives a*1000 + 100b + 10c + 1, which must also be divisible by 7.

So, four

---------------

 conditions:

1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Hmm

---------------

, that's four congruences. Let me compute each of these modulo 7 and see what conditions they impose on a, b, c, d.

First, let me compute 1000 mod 7, 100 mod 7, 10 mod 7, and 1 mod 7.

Compute

---------------

 1000 mod 7: 7*142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 7*14=98, so 100-98=2. So 100 ≡ 2 mod7.

10 mod7 is 3, since 7*1=7, 10-7=3.

1 mod7 is 1.

So:



---------------

1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod7
2. 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡0 mod7
3. 1000a + 100b +10 + d ≡6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡0 mod7
4. 1000a + 100b +10c +1 ≡6a + 2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7

So,

---------------

 four equations:

Equation1: 6 + 2b +3c +d ≡0 mod7
Equation2:6a + 2 +3c +d ≡0 mod7
Equation3:6a + 2b +3 +d ≡0 mod7
Equation4:6a + 2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7

Hmm

---------------

, perhaps I can subtract equations to eliminate some variables.

Let me subtract Equation1 from Equation4:

Equation4 - Equation1: (6a +2b +3c +1) - (6 +2b +3c +d) = 6a -6 +0 +0 +1 -d.

So

---------------

, 6a -6 +1 -d ≡0 mod7.

Which simplifies to 6a -5 -d ≡0 mod7.

So, 6a -d ≡5 mod7.

Similarly

---------------

, let's subtract Equation2 from Equation4:

Equation4 - Equation2: (6a +2b +3c +1) - (6a +2 +3c +d) = 0a +2b -2 +0 +1 -d.

So, 2b -1 -d ≡0 mod7.

So, 2b -d ≡1 mod7.

Now

---------------

, Equation3:6a +2b +3 +d ≡0 mod7.

I can maybe express d from Equation

---------------

3.

From Equation3: d ≡ -6a -2b -3 mod7.

Similarly, from Equation1: d ≡ -6 -2b -3c mod7.

Wait

---------------

, but perhaps it's better to find relations between a, b, c, d.

Wait, let me see. Let

---------------

 me list all four equations again:

1. 6 +2b +3c +d ≡0 mod7 →

---------------

 d ≡ -6 -2b -3c mod7
2. 6a +2 +3c +d ≡0 mod7 → d ≡ -6a -2 -3c mod7
3. 6a +2b +3 +d ≡0 mod7 → d ≡ -6a -2b -3 mod7
4. 6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7 → d ≡ -6a -2b -3c -1 mod7



---------------

Wait, but each equation gives d in terms of other variables. Since all four must be true, perhaps I can set them

---------------

 equal to each other.

From Equation1 and Equation2:

d ≡ (-6 -2b -3c) mod7


---------------

d ≡ (-6a -2 -3c) mod7

So, (-6 -2b -3c) ≡ (-6a -2 -3c) mod7.

Simplify:

-6 -2b -3c +6a +2 +3c ≡0 mod7.

S

---------------

implify terms:

(-6 +2) + (-2b) + (-3c +3c) +6a → (-4) -2b +0 +6a ≡0 mod7.

So, 6a -2b -4 ≡0 mod7.

Let

---------------

 me write this as 6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

Similarly, I can factor out 2: 2*(3a -b) ≡4 mod7.

Div

---------------

ide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, the inverse of 2 mod7 is 4 because 2*4=8≡1 mod7).

So, 3a -b ≡4*4 mod7 → 3a -b ≡16 mod7 → 16 mod7 is 2, since 7*2=14, 16-14=2.

So, 3a -b ≡2 mod7. Let me note this as Equation A.

Similarly, let's take

---------------

 Equation1 and Equation3:

Equation1: d ≡ (-6 -2b -3c) mod7
Equation3: d ≡ (-6a -2b -3) mod7

Set them equal:

(-6 -2b -3c) ≡ (-6a -2b -3) mod7

Simplify:

-6 -2b -3c +6a +2b +3 ≡0 mod7.

S

---------------

implify terms:

(-6 +3) + (-2b +2b) + (-3c) +6a → (-3) + 0 + (-3c) +6a ≡0 mod7.

So, 6a -3c -3 ≡0 mod7.

Factor out 3: 3*(2a -c -1) ≡0 mod7.

Since 3 and 7 are coprime, this implies 2a -c -1 ≡0 mod7 → 2a -c ≡1 mod7. Let's call this Equation B.

Now, let's take Equation1 and Equation4.

Equation1: d ≡ (-6 -2b -3c) mod7
Equation4: d ≡ (-6a -2b -3c -1) mod7

Set equal:

-6 -2b -3c ≡ -6a -2b -3c -1 mod7.

Simplify:

-6 -2b -3c +6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

Simplify terms:

(-6 +1) + (-2b +2b) + (-3c +3c) +6a → (-5) +0 +0 +6a ≡0 mod7.

So, 6a -5 ≡0 mod7 →6a ≡5 mod7.

Multiply

---------------

 both sides by the inverse of 6 mod7. Since 6*6=36≡1 mod7, the inverse of 6 is 6.

So, a ≡5*6 mod7 →5*6=30 →

---------------

30 mod7: 7*4=28, so 30-28=2 →a ≡2 mod7.

Since a is a digit (1 to 9), possible values for a are 2 and 9 (since 2+7=9,

---------------

 which is still a single digit). But since we're looking for the greatest four-digit number, we should start with a=9 and

---------------

 check if it's possible, then a=2.

Wait, but wait, if a ≡2 mod7, possible digits for a are 2,9.

---------------

 Because 2+7=9, and the next would be 16, which is two digits, so a can only be 2 or 9.

Since

---------------

 we're looking for the greatest N, let's try a=9 first.

So, a=9.

From Equation A: 3a -b ≡2 mod7 →3*9 -b ≡2 mod7 →27 -b ≡2 mod7.

27 mod7: 7*3=21, 27-21=6 →6 -b ≡2 mod7 →-b ≡2 -6 →-b ≡-4 mod7 →b ≡4 mod7.

Since b is a digit (0-9), possible values for b are 4 and 11, but 11 is not a digit, so b=4.

So, b=4.

From Equation B: 2a -c ≡1 mod7 →2*9 -c ≡1 mod7 →18 -c ≡1 mod7.

18 mod7: 7*2=14, 18-14=4 →4 -c ≡1 mod7 →-c ≡1-4 →-c ≡-3 mod7 →c ≡3 mod7.

So, possible c values are 3 and 10, but 10 is invalid, so c=3.

So, c=3.

Now, from Equation1: d ≡ (-6 -2b -3c) mod7.

Substitute b=4, c=3:

d ≡ (-6 -2*4 -3*3) mod7 →-6 -8 -9 = -23 mod7.

Compute -23 mod7: 7*3=21, so -23 +21= -2, but

---------------

 that's negative. Alternatively, 23 ÷7 is 3*7=21, remainder 2. So, 23 ≡2 mod7, so -23 ≡-2 mod7 → which is equivalent to 5 mod7 (since -2 +7=5).

So, d ≡5 mod7. So, possible d values are 5 and 12, but 12 is invalid, so d=5.

So, with

---------------

 a=9, b=4, c=3, d=5, let's check if this satisfies all four equations.

Let

---------------

 me compute each condition.

First, N=9435.

Check changing each digit to 1:

1. Changing a to 1: 1435. Is 1435 divisible by 7?

Let me compute 1435 ÷7. 7*200=1400, so 1435-1400=35. 35 ÷7=5. So yes, 1435 is 205*7, so divisible by7.

2. Changing b to 1: 9135. Let's check 9135 ÷7. 7*1300=9100, 9135-9100=35. 35 ÷7=5, so 9135=1305*7, divisible by7.

3. Changing c to1: 9415. Let's see: 9415 ÷7. 7*1345=9415,

---------------

 because 7*1300=9100, 7*45=315, so 9100+315=9415. So yes, divisible by7.

4. Changing d to1: 9431. Let's check 9431 ÷7.

Hmm

---------------

, 7*1347=9429, because 7*1300=9100, 7*47=329, so 9100+329=9429. So 9431-9429=2. So remainder 2. That

---------------

 means 9431 is not divisible by7.

Oh no, that's a problem. So, changing d to 1 gives 9431, which isn't divisible by7. So N=9435 doesn't satisfy the condition. So,

---------------

 that's a problem. So, perhaps a=9 is not possible, or maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, maybe I made an error in calculating

---------------

 d.

Let me recheck Equation1: d ≡ (-6 -2b -3c) mod7.

With b=4, c=3: d ≡ (-6 -8 -9) = (-23) mod7.

Compute

---------------

 -23 mod7: 7*3=21, so -23 +28=5, because 28 is 7*4. So, -23 ≡5 mod7. So, d=5.



---------------

But when I changed d to1, the number was 9431, which is 9431 ÷7.



---------------

Wait, maybe I miscalculated 9431 ÷7. Let me try dividing 9431 by7.



---------------

7*1347=9429 as before. So 9431-9429=2. So, 9431=

---------------

7*1347 +2. So remainder 2, not 0. So, it's not divisible by7. So N=9435 doesn't satisfy the condition.

---------------

 So, that means a=9, b=4, c=3, d=5 is invalid.

Hmm, so maybe a=9 isn't possible. Let's try a=2.

So

---------------

, a=2.

From Equation A: 3a -b ≡2 mod7 →3*2 -b ≡2 →6 -b ≡2 mod7 →-b ≡2-6 →-b ≡-4 mod7 →b ≡4 mod7.

So, possible b values are 4 and 11, but 11 is invalid, so b=4.

From Equation B: 2a -c ≡1 mod7 →2*2 -c ≡1 →4 -c ≡1 mod7 →-c ≡1-4 →-c ≡-3 mod7 →c ≡3 mod7.

So, possible c values are 3 and 10, but 10 is invalid, so c=3.

Now, from Equation1: d ≡ (-6 -2b -3c) mod7.

Substitute b=4, c=3: d ≡ (-6 -8 -9) = (-23) mod7,

---------------

 which is 5, as before.

So, d=5.

So, N would be 2435.

Wait, but we

---------------

're looking for the greatest four-digit number, so 2435 is much smaller than 9435, but perhaps

---------------

 9435 doesn't work, so maybe a=2 is the only possible a.

Wait, but let's check if N=2435 satisfies the condition.

Check each digit

---------------

 change to1:

1. Changing a to1: 1435. As before, 1435 ÷7=205, which is exact

---------------

.

2. Changing b to1: 2135. Let's check 2135 ÷7.

7*305=2135, since 7*300=2100, 7*5=35, so 2100+35=2135. So yes, divisible by7.

3. Changing c to1: 2415. 2415 ÷7: 7*345=2415, since

---------------

 7*300=2100, 7*45=315, so 2100+315=2415. Divisible.

4. Changing d to1: 2431. Let's check 2431 ÷7.

7*347=2429, so 2431-2429=2. So remainder 2, not divisible by7. Hmm, so that

---------------

's a problem.

Wait, so N=2435 doesn't satisfy the condition either because changing d to1 gives 2431, which isn't divisible by7. So, perhaps

---------------

 my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the equations. Let me go back and check.

Wait, I

---------------

 had four equations:

1. 6 +2b +3c +d ≡0 mod7 → d ≡-6 -2b -3c mod7.

2. 6a +2 +3c +d ≡0 mod7 → d ≡-6a -2 -3c mod7.

3. 6a +2b +3 +d ≡0 mod7 → d ≡-6a -2b -3 mod7.

4. 6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7 → d ≡-6a -2b -3c -1 mod7.

So

---------------

, from equation1 and equation2, I derived that 6a -2b ≡4 mod7, leading to 3a -b ≡2 mod7.

From equation1 and equation3, I got 6a -3c -3 ≡0 mod7, leading to 2a -c ≡1 mod7.

From equation1 and equation4, I got 6a ≡5 mod7, leading to a ≡2 mod7.

Wait, but maybe

---------------

 I missed something else. Let me try to find another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express all variables in terms of a.

From equation4: 6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7 →6a +2b +3c ≡-1 mod7.

From equation3:6a +2b +3 +d ≡0 mod7 →d ≡-6a -2b -3 mod7.

From equation2:6a +2 +3c +d ≡0 mod7 →d ≡-6a -2 -3c mod7.

From equation1:6 +2b +3c +d ≡0 mod7 →d ≡-6 -2b -3c mod7.

So, from

---------------

 equation3 and equation2:

-6a -2b -3 ≡-6a -2 -3c mod7 → subtract right

---------------

 side from left:

(-6a -2b -3) - (-6a -2 -3c) ≡0 mod7 → (-2b -3) - (-2 -3c) →-2b -3 +2 +3c ≡0 mod7 →-2b +3c -1 ≡0 mod7.

Hmm, so

---------------

 -2b +3c ≡1 mod7 →2b -3c ≡-1 mod7 →2b -3c ≡6 mod7.

Not

---------------

 sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a value for a, then find b, c, d accordingly.

Wait

---------------

, from equation4: 6a +2b +3c ≡-1 mod7.

And from equation1: d ≡-6 -2b -3c mod7.

From

---------------

 equation4, 6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7 (since -1 mod7 is 6).

Wait

---------------

, perhaps I can find 6a mod7, given that a=2 or 9.

If a=9, 6a=54 →

---------------

54 mod7: 7*7=49, 54-49=5 →5 mod7.

So, 6a=5 mod7.

So, equation4:5 +2b +3c ≡6 mod7 →2b +3c ≡1 mod7.

From

---------------

 equation1: d ≡-6 -2b -3c mod7.

But 2b +3c ≡1 mod7 →-2b -3c ≡-1 mod7.

So, d ≡-6 + (-2b -3c) ≡-6 -1 mod7 →-7 mod7→0 mod7. So d≡0 mod7.

So, d must be 0 or7.

But from equation1, d �

---------------

� (-6 -2b -3c) mod7, and since 2b +3c ≡1 mod7, then d ≡ (-6 -1) mod7 →-7 mod7→0.

So, d must be 0 or7.

But earlier

---------------

, when a=9, I found d=5, which contradicts this. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, when

---------------

 a=9, from equation4, 6a=5 mod7, so 5 +2b +3c ≡6 →2b +3c ≡1 mod7.

From

---------------

 equation1, d ≡-6 -2b -3c mod7. Since 2b +3c ≡1, then d ≡-6 -1 �

---------------

�-7 ≡0 mod7. So d must be 0 or7.

But earlier, when I used equation1, I got

---------------

 d=5, which is not 0 mod7. So, that suggests an error in my earlier approach.

Wait, perhaps I made

---------------

 a mistake in equation1. Let me re-express equation1.

Equation1: 6 +2b +3c +d ≡0 mod7 →d ≡-6 -2b -3c mod7.

But from equation4, 6a +2b +3c ≡-1 mod7 → since

---------------

 a=9, 6*9=54≡5 mod7, so 5 +2b +3c ≡-1 →5 +2b +3c ≡6 mod7 →2b +3c ≡1 mod7.

So, equation

---------------

1: d ≡-6 -2b -3c mod7 → since 2b +3c ≡1 →-6 -1 →

---------------

-7 →0 mod7.

So, d ≡0 mod7. So, d=0 or7.

So

---------------

, when a=9, d must be 0 or7.

Wait, earlier, when I substituted a=9, b=4, c=3, I got d=5, which is

---------------

 wrong because d should be 0 or7. So, that suggests that perhaps my earlier approach was incorrect because I might have used

---------------

 the wrong equations.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me try to find a, b, c, d such that all four conditions are satisfied, especially

---------------

 ensuring that d is 0 or7 when a=9.

Let me try a=9 again.

So, a=9.

From equation A:3a -b ≡2 mod7 →27 -b ≡2 →6 -b ≡2 →-b ≡-4 →b ≡4 mod7. So b=4.

From equation B:2a -c ≡1 mod7 →18 -c ≡1 →-c ≡-17 →c ≡17 mod7 →17 mod7 is 3 (since 7*2=14, 17-14=3). So c=3.

Now, equation4:6a +2b +3c ≡6*9 +2*4 +3*3 =54 +8 +9=71. 71 mod7: 7*10=70, so 71-70=1 →71≡1 mod7. But equation4 requires it to be ≡-1 mod7, which is 6 mod7. So 1≡6 mod7? No, that's not true. So, this

---------------

 suggests inconsistency, meaning that a=9, b=4, c=3 doesn't satisfy equation4.

Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps a=9 is not possible.

Wait, let

---------------

 me check equation4 again: 6a +2b +3c ≡-1 mod7. So, with

---------------

 a=9, b=4, c=3, 6a=54≡5, 2b=8≡1, 3c=9≡2. So 5+1+2=8≡1 mod7. But equation4 requires it to be ≡6 mod7. So, 1≡6 mod7? No, so this is

---------------

 a contradiction. Therefore, a=9, b=4, c=3 is invalid.

So, perhaps a=9 isn't possible. Let's try a=2.

a=2.

From equation A:3a -b ≡2 →6 -b ≡2 →-b ≡-4 →b≡4 mod7. So, b=4.

From equation B:2a -c ≡1 →4 -c ≡1 →-c ≡-3 →c≡3 mod7. So, c=3.

Now, equation4:6a +2b +3c ≡6*2 +2*4 +3*3=12+8+9=29. 29 mod7: 7*4=28, 29-28=1. So, 29≡1 mod7. But equation4 requires it to be ≡6 mod7. So, 1≡6 mod7? No. So, this

---------------

 is also a contradiction.

Hmm, so both a=9 and a=2 lead to contradictions in equation4. That suggests that perhaps my earlier approach is missing something.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust

---------------

 the equations differently. Let me try another approach.

Let me consider that when I change any digit to 1, the number becomes divisible by7. So, perhaps

---------------

 the original number N is not necessarily divisible by7, but changing any digit to1 makes it so.

Wait, but if

---------------

 a digit is already 1, then changing it to1 doesn't change the number, so N must be divisible by7 in that case. So, N must be divisible by7 if any digit is1. But since

---------------

 we're looking for the greatest N, perhaps N itself is not divisible by7, but changing any digit to1 makes it divisible by7.

Wait, but if

---------------

 N has a 1 in any digit, then changing that digit to1 leaves N unchanged, so N must be divisible by7. So, if N has any digit as1, then N must be divisible by7. So, perhaps

---------------

 N is divisible by7, but when you change a non-1 digit to1, it's still divisible by7.

Wait, but the

---------------

 problem says that when you change any digit to1, the resulting number is divisible by7. So, if N has a digit that is1, then N must be divisible by7, but

---------------

 for digits that are not1, changing them to1 must also result in a number divisible by7.

But perhaps N itself is not necessarily divisible by7. For example, if all digits are not1, then changing any digit to1 would

---------------

 result in a number divisible by7, but N itself might not be.

But wait, if N has a digit that's1, then changing that digit to1 doesn't change the number, so N must be divisible by7.

So, if

---------------

 N has any digit that is1, then N must be divisible by7. But the problem doesn't specify that N must

---------------

 be divisible by7, only that changing any digit to1 results in a number divisible by7.

Wait, but if N has a digit that is1, then N must be divisible by7, because changing that digit to1 (which it already is) doesn't change N. So, in that case, N must be divisible by7.

But if

---------------

 N has no digits that are1, then changing any digit to1 will result in a number divisible by7, but N itself may or may not be divisible by7.

So

---------------

, perhaps the problem allows N to have digits that are1, but then N must be divisible by7.

But perhaps the maximum

---------------

 N is 9999, but let's check if that satisfies the condition.

Wait, 9999: changing any digit to1 gives

---------------

 1999, 9199, 9919, 9991.

Check 1999 ÷7: 7*285=1995, 1999-1995=4 → remainder 4. So, not divisible by7. So, 9999 doesn't work.

Next, 9998: changing any digit to1 gives 1998, 9198, 9918, 9991.

Check 1998 ÷7: 7*285=1995, 1998-1995=3 → remainder3. Not divisible.

This

---------------

 might take a while. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the earlier approach but correct the mistake.

Wait, earlier when a=9, I found that equation4 wasn

---------------

't satisfied, which suggests that perhaps a=9 isn't possible. So, maybe I need to consider other possibilities.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I made a mistake in the earlier steps when I subtracted equations. Let me try again.

From equation4:6a +2b +3c ≡-1 mod7.

From equation3:6a +2b +3 +d ≡0 mod7 →d ≡-6a -2b -3 mod7.

From equation2:6a +2 +3c +d ≡0 mod7 →d ≡-6a -2 -3c mod7.

From equation1:6 +2b +3c +d ≡0 mod7 →d ≡-6 -2b -3c mod7.

So, from equation3 and equation2, I

---------------

 have:

d ≡-6a -2b -3 mod7 (from equation3)
d ≡-6a -2 -3c mod7 (from equation2)

So, set equal:

-6a -2b -3 ≡-6a -2 -3c mod7.

Cancel -6a from both sides:

-2b -3 ≡-2 -3c mod7.

Rearrange:

-2b +3c ≡1 mod7.

Similarly, from equation1 and equation3:

d ≡-6 -2b -3c mod7 (from equation1)
d ≡-6a -2b -3 mod7 (from equation3)

Set equal:

-6 -2b -3c ≡-6a -2b -3 mod7.

Cancel -2b from both sides:

-6 -3c ≡-6a -3 mod7.

Rearrange:

6a -6 -3c +3 ≡0 mod7 →6a -3 -3c ≡0 mod7 →6a -3c ≡3 mod7.

Divide both sides by3 (since 3 and7 are coprime, inverse of3 is5 because 3*5=15≡1 mod7).

So, 2a -c ≡1 mod7 →2

---------------

a -c ≡1 mod7.

Which is equation B as before.

So, from equation B: 2a -c ≡1 mod7.

From equation A:3a -b ≡2 mod7.

And from the earlier step, -

---------------

2b +3c ≡1 mod7.

So, we have:

1. 3a -b ≡2 mod7 (

---------------

equation A)
2. 2a -c ≡1 mod7 (equation B)
3. -2b +3c ≡1 mod7 (new equation)
4. 6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7 (since -1 mod7 is6)

So

---------------

, perhaps I can solve these equations step by step.

Let me express b and c in terms of a.

From equation B: c ≡2a -1 mod7.

From equation A: b ≡3a -2 mod7.

Now, substitute b and c into equation3:

-2*(3a -2) +3*(2a -1) ≡1 mod7.

Compute:

-6a +4 +6a -3 ≡1 mod7.

Simplify:

(-6a +6a) + (4 -3) ≡1 →0a +1 ≡1 mod7.

Which is 1≡1 mod7, which is always true. So, no new information.

So, now

---------------

, equation4:6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

Express b and c in terms of a.

b=3a -2 mod7.

c=2a -1 mod7.

So, substitute into equation4:

6a +2*(3a -2) +3*(2a -1) ≡6 mod7.

Compute:

6a +6a -4 +6a -3 ≡6 mod7.

Combine like terms:

(6a +6a +6a) + (-4 -3) ≡6 mod7 →18a -7 ≡6 mod7.

Simplify:

18a mod7: 18 ÷7=2*7=14, remainder4 →18≡4 mod7. So, 4a -7 ≡6 mod7.

But -7 ≡0 mod7, so 4a ≡6 mod7.

So, 4a ≡6 mod7.

Multiply both sides by inverse of4 mod7. The inverse of4 mod7 is 2 because 4*2=8≡1 mod7.

So, a ≡6*2 mod7 →12 mod7 →5 mod7.

So, a≡5 mod7. Since a is a digit (1-9), possible a values are5 and 12, but 12 is invalid, so a=5.

So, a=5.

Now, from equation A: b=3a -2 mod7 →3*5=15 mod

---------------

7=1 →1 -2= -1 mod7=6. So, b=6.

From equation B: c=2a -1 mod7 →2*5=10 mod7=3 →3 -1=2 mod7. So, c=2.

Now, from equation1: d ≡-6 -2b -3c mod7.

Substitute b=6, c=2:

d ≡-6 -12 -6 =-24 mod7.

Compute -24 mod7: 7*3=21, so -24 +28=4 →-24≡4 mod7. So, d=4.

So, N=5624.

Wait, but let

---------------

's check if this works.

Check each condition:

1. Changing a to1:1624. 1624 ÷7: 7*232=1624, yes.

2. Changing b to1:5124. 5124 ÷7: 7*732=5124, yes.

3. Changing c to1:5614. 5614 ÷7: Let's compute 7*802=5614, yes.

4. Changing d to1:5621. Let's check 5621 ÷7.

7*803=5621,

---------------

 because 7*800=5600, 7*3=21, so 5600+21=5621. So yes, divisible by7.

So, N=5624 satisfies all four conditions.

But wait, is

---------------

 this the greatest possible N? Because earlier, when a=9, I found N=9435, but it didn't satisfy the condition because changing d to1 gave a non-divisible number. So, perhaps 5624 is the maximum

---------------

, but I'm not sure. Let's check if there are higher a's that could work.

Wait, from equation4, we found that a≡5 mod7. So, possible a's are5 and 12, but 12 is invalid. So, a=5 is the only possibility.

So, N=5624.

Wait, but wait

---------------

, 5624 is less than 9435, but 9435 didn't work. So, perhaps 5624 is the maximum possible. But let's check if a=5 is indeed the maximum possible.

Wait, but

---------------

 maybe I made a mistake in the equation. Let me confirm the calculations.

From equation4:6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

With a=5, b=6, c=2:

6*5=30≡

---------------

2 mod7, 2*6=12≡5, 3*2=6≡6.

So, 2 +5 +6=13≡6 mod7. So

---------------

 yes, 13 mod7=6. Correct.

So, equation4 is satisfied.

Similarly, check equation1: d=4.

From

---------------

 equation1: d≡-6 -2b -3c mod7 →-6 -12 -6 =-24≡4 mod7. So, d=4.

So, N=5624.

Wait, but I

---------------

 thought earlier that a=5 is the only possible a, so N=5624 is the maximum possible. But let

---------------

's check if there's a higher N.

Wait, but a=5, so the maximum four-digit number would have a=9, but that

---------------

 didn't work. So, perhaps 5624 is the answer.

But wait, let me check if there's a higher N. For

---------------

 example, what if a=5, but b is higher than6, but still satisfies b≡6 mod7. Since

---------------

 b is a digit, b can be6 or13, but 13 is invalid. So, b=6 is the only option.

Similarly, c=2 is

---------------

 the only option for c, since c≡2 mod7.

So, N=5624 is the maximum possible.



---------------

Wait, but let me check a=5, b=6, c=2, d=4.

Changing each digit to1:

1. a→1:1624,

---------------

 which is divisible by7.
2. b→1:5124, divisible by7.
3. c→1:5614, divisible by7.
4. d→1:5621, divisible by7.

All four

---------------

 are divisible by7, so N=5624 works.

Now, the problem asks for Q and R when N is divided by1000. So, N=5624.

Dividing 5624 by1000: Q=5, R=624.

So, Q+R=5+624=629.

Wait, but before

---------------

 finalizing, I should check if there's a higher N than5624 that satisfies the condition.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I missed something earlier. Let me think.

Wait, when a=5, N=5624. But is

---------------

 there a higher a that could work? Earlier, when I thought a=9 and a=2 didn't work, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let

---------------

 me try a=5, but perhaps there's a higher a possible. Wait, from equation4, a≡5 mod7, so a=5,12,... but a=12 is invalid. So, a=5 is the only possible.



---------------

Thus, N=5624 is the maximum four-digit number satisfying the condition.

Therefore, Q=5, R=624, so Q+R=5+624=629.


To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number \( N \) such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - \( N \) is a four-digit number, so \( 1000 \leq N \leq 9999 \).
   - Changing any digit of \( N \) to 1 must result in a number divisible by 7.

2. **Formulating the Conditions**:
   - Let \( N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \), where \( a, b, c, d \) are digits.
   - Changing each digit to 1 must

---------------

 satisfy the divisibility condition by 7:
     - \( 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
     - \( 1000a + 100 + 10c + d \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
     - \( 1000a + 100b + 10 + d \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
     - \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)

3. **Simplifying Modulo 7**:
   - Compute powers of 10 modulo 7:
     - \( 1000 \equiv 6 \mod 7 \)
     - \( 100 \equiv 2 \mod 7 \)
     - \( 10 \equiv 3 \mod 7 \)
     - \( 1 \equiv 1 \mod 7 \)
   - Rewrite

---------------

 each condition using these values:
     1. \( 6 + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
     2. \( 6a + 2 + 3c + d \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
     3. \( 6a + 2b + 3 + d \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
     4. \( 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)

4. **Deriving Equations**:
   - Subtract equations to eliminate variables:
     - From equations 1 and 4: \( 6a - d \equiv 5 \mod 7 \)
     - From equations 2 and 4: \( 2b - d \equiv 1 \mod 7 \)
     - From equations 1 and 2: \( 6a - 2b \equiv 4 \mod 7 \)
     - From equations 1 and 3: \( 6a - 3c \equiv 3 \mod 7 \)

5. **Solving for Variables**:
   - From \( 6a - 2b \equiv 4 \mod 7 \), we find \( 3a - b \equiv 2 \mod 7 \).
   - From \( 6a - 3c \equiv 3 \mod 7 \), we find \( 2a - c \equiv 1 \mod 7 \).
   - Solving these, we determine \( a \equiv 5 \mod 7 \), so \( a = 5 \) (since \( a \) is a digit).

6. **Finding \( b, c, d \)**:
   - With \( a = 5 \):
     - \( b \equiv 3(5) - 2 \equiv 13 \equiv 6 \mod 7 \), so \( b = 6 \).
     - \( c \equiv 2(5) - 1 \equiv 9 \equiv 2 \mod 7 \), so \( c = 2 \).
     - From \( d \equiv -6 - 2b - 3c \mod 7 \), substituting \( b = 6 \) and \( c = 2 \), we get \( d = 4 \).

7. **Constructing \( N \)**:
   - Thus, \( N = 5624 \).

8. **Verifying the Conditions**:
   - Changing each digit to 1:
     - \( 1624 \div 7 = 232 \) (exact)
     - \( 5124 \div 7 = 732 \) (exact)
     - \( 5614 \div 7 = 802 \) (exact)
     - \( 5621 \div 7 = 803 \) (exact)

9. **Calculating \( Q + R \)**:
   - \( N = 5624 \),

---------------

 so \( Q = 5 \) and \( R = 624 \).
   - \( Q + R = 5 + 624 = 629 \).
