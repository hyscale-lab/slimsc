Okay, so I've got this problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue, each with equal probability. The question is about finding the probability that after coloring, there's a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally, and vice versa. They

---------------

 mention that the probability will be m/n where m and n are coprime, and I need to find m + n.

Hmm, let me try

---------------

 to parse this. So each vertex is colored red or blue independently with a 50-50 chance. The octagon has eight vertices. So

---------------

, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256. That's the denominator of our probability.

Now, the numerator is the number of colorings where there exists a rotation such that when you rotate the octagon, all the blue vertices move to positions that were originally red, and the red ones move to where the blues were. So, essentially

---------------

, after rotation, blue becomes red and red becomes blue. So, it's like a perfect swapping of colors via rotation.

Wait, maybe

---------------

 I should think in terms of transformations. The octagon has rotational symmetry. The group of rotations is cyclic of order 8, right

---------------

? So, the rotations are by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., up to 315°, corresponding to rotation

---------------

 by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 positions.

So, for each rotation, say by k positions, we can check whether the coloring is such that when

---------------

 you rotate by k, the color at each vertex is flipped. That is, if the original color was red, it becomes blue, and vice versa.

But

---------------

 wait, the problem says that "all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, it

---------------

's not necessarily that every blue vertex becomes red, but rather that when you rotate, every blue vertex moves to a spot that was red. So

---------------

, if you have a blue vertex at position i, after rotating by k, it's at position (i + k) mod 8, and that position was originally red.

But

---------------

 in the problem statement, it's the rotated octagon such that all blue vertices end up where there were originally red. So, for

---------------

 the rotated octagon, the blue vertices are exactly the red ones in the original. So, the rotated coloring is the complement of the original coloring.

Wait

---------------

, that's an important point. So, the rotated version of the coloring is the complement of the original. That is, if

---------------

 C is the original coloring, then rotating C by k gives the complement of C.

So, mathematically, for each vertex i, color

---------------

(i + k) = not color(i), where the addition is modulo 8.

So, the condition is that for some rotation k, the

---------------

 coloring is such that every vertex i has color(i + k) = 1 - color(i). Since colors are binary, red

---------------

 is 0 and blue is 1, or vice versa, doesn't matter as long as we're consistent.

So, how

---------------

 do we count such colorings? Let's denote the rotation by k steps, so k can be from 0 to 7. For each k, we can check

---------------

 how many colorings satisfy the condition that rotating by k gives the complement.

But we need to be careful because some colorings might satisfy this condition for multiple k's. So, we

---------------

 can't just add up the counts for each k because that would overcount.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a

---------------

 system of equations. For each vertex i, color(i + k) = 1 - color(i). Let's write this as color(i + k) + color(i) = 1.

But

---------------

 since this must hold for all i, the coloring must satisfy a kind of linear recurrence.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Since

---------------

 the octagon is regular, the rotations form a group, and we can use group theory or Burnside's lemma or something similar. But I'm not sure.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe think about the coloring as a binary string of length 8, and the rotation by k steps corresponds to shifting the string. The condition is that the shifted string is the bitwise complement of the original string.

So, the

---------------

 problem reduces to finding the number of binary strings of length 8 such that for some k, shifting the string by k positions results in the complement of the original string.

Hmm

---------------

, that's an interesting way to think about it. So, how many such binary strings are there?

Let me try to model

---------------

 this. Let me denote the original string as s = s0 s1 s2 ... s7, where each si is 0 or 1. The

---------------

 shifted string by k positions is s' = sk sk+1 ... s7 s0 s1 ... sk-1. We require that s' is the complement of s, so for all i, s'i

---------------

 = 1 - si.

So, for all i, sk + i = 1 - s_i, where the indices are modulo 8.

Wait

---------------

, that's the same as s_{(i + k) mod 8} = 1 - s_i for all i.

So

---------------

, let's write this as s_{i + k} = 1 - s_i for all i.

This is a system of equations that

---------------

 the string s must satisfy.

Now, for each k, the system is:

s_{i + k} = 1 - s_i for i = 0, 1, ..., 7.

But

---------------

 we have to remember that (i + k) mod 8 is another index, so the equations are cyclic.

So, for

---------------

 each k, we can see if this system has solutions, and then count the number of solutions.

Wait, but for each

---------------

 k, we can think of the system as a linear recurrence. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the orbit

---------------

 structure. Since shifting by k steps, the octagon is partitioned into cycles. Each cycle is a set of vertices that are mapped

---------------

 onto each other by repeated shifts of k.

The number of such cycles is equal to the greatest common divisor of k and 8, right

---------------

? Because the number of cycles is gcd(k, 8). So, for example, if k=1, gcd(1,8)=1, so there

---------------

's one cycle of length 8. If k=2, gcd(2,8)=2, so two cycles of length 4, etc.

Wait

---------------

, yes, the number of cycles is d = gcd(k,8), and each cycle has length 8/d.

So, in each cycle, the system

---------------

 of equations requires that s_{i + k} = 1 - s_i.

But since in each cycle, the indices wrap around, this

---------------

 imposes certain constraints.

Let me take an example. Suppose k=1. Then, the cycle is the whole octagon. So, s

---------------

1 = 1 - s0, s2 = 1 - s1 = s0, s3 = 1 - s2 = 1 - s0, and so on. So, we

---------------

 get a pattern where s0, s2, s4, s6 are all equal, and s1, s3, s5, s7 are their complements.

So

---------------

, for k=1, the coloring must alternate between two colors every step. But since 8 is even, this is possible. So, the

---------------

 number of such colorings is 2: all red and blue alternating starting with red, or starting with blue.

Wait, but in

---------------

 our case, the colors can be any combination as long as the condition holds. So, for k=1, the system

---------------

 reduces to s_{i+1} = 1 - s_i for all i. So, the coloring is forced to be alternating red

---------------

 and blue.

So, for k=1, the number of colorings is 2: one starting with red, the other starting with blue.

Similarly, for k=2. Let's see.

---------------

 Let's take k=2, so d = gcd(2,8)=2, so there are two cycles, each of length 4.

So, each

---------------

 cycle is i, i+2, i+4, i+6. So, for each cycle, we have s_{i+2} = 1 - s_i, and s_{i+4} = 1 - s_{i+2} = s_i, and s_{i+6} = 1 - s_{i+4} = 1 - s_i.

So, for

---------------

 each cycle, the coloring alternates every two steps. So, s0, s2, s4, s6 must satisfy s2 = 1 - s0, s4 = 1 - s2 = s0, s6 = 1 - s4 = 1 - s0.

Similarly, for the other cycle, s1, s3, s5, s7 must satisfy s3 = 1 - s1, s5 = 1 - s3 = s1, s7 = 1 - s5 = 1 - s1.

So, each cycle is

---------------

 determined by the value of s0 and s1. Each cycle can independently choose s0 and s1, which then determine the rest of the cycle.

So, for each cycle, we

---------------

 have 2 choices (s0 can be 0 or 1, and s1 can be 0 or 1). So, the total number of colorings for k=2 is 2 * 2 = 4.

Wait, but let

---------------

's verify. For each cycle, we have two independent bits, s0 and s1, each can be 0 or 1. Then, the rest are determined. So, yes

---------------

, 2^2 =4 colorings for k=2.

Similarly, for k=3. Let's see: gcd(3,8)=1, so the

---------------

 entire octagon is one cycle.

So, s_{i+3} = 1 - s_i for all i. So, let

---------------

's try to write down the implications.

Starting with s0, s3 = 1 - s0.

s3 = 1 - s0,

---------------

 so s6 = 1 - s3 = s0.

s6 = s0, so s1 = 1 - s6 = 1 - s0.

s1 = 1 - s0, so s4 = 1 - s1 = s0.

s4 = s0, so s7 = 1 - s4 = 1 - s0.

s7 = 1 - s0, so s2 = 1 - s7 = s0.

s2 = s0, so s5 = 1 - s2 = 1 - s0.

s5 = 1 - s0, so s8 = 1 - s5 = s0. But s8 is s0, which is consistent.

So, the

---------------

 entire coloring is determined by s0. So, s0 can be 0 or 1, and all other s_i are determined based

---------------

 on s0.

So, the number of colorings is 2 for k=3.

Similarly, for k=4. Let's compute gcd

---------------

(4,8)=4. So, the number of cycles is 4, each of length 2.

Each cycle is i, i+4. So, for each cycle, s_{i+4} = 1 - s_i.

Therefore, in each cycle, the two elements must be different. So, for each cycle, we

---------------

 have two choices: s_i = 0, s_{i+4}=1 or s_i=1, s_{i+4}=0.

Since there are four cycles, each independent, the total number of colorings is 2^4 = 16.

Wait, but

---------------

 let me think. Each cycle has two elements, and they must be different. So, for each cycle, 2 choices. So

---------------

, with four cycles, 2^4=16 colorings.

Similarly, for k=5. gcd(5,8)=1, so it

---------------

's a single cycle. So, similar to k=3.

So, s_{i+5} = 1 - s_i for all i.

So

---------------

, let's see:

s5 = 1 - s0

s0 = 1 - s5 = 1 - (1 - s0) = s0. So, no

---------------

 problem.

s_{10} mod 8 is s2 = 1 - s5 = s0

s_{15} mod8 is s7 = 1 - s2 = 1 - s0

s_{20} mod8 is s4 = 1 - s7 = s0

s_{25} mod8 is s1 = 1 - s4 = 1 - s0

s_{30} mod8 is s6 = 1 - s1 = s0

s_{35} mod8 is s3 = 1 - s6 = 1 - s0

s_{40} mod8 is s0 = 1 - s3 = 1 - (1 - s0) = s0.

So, all

---------------

 equations are consistent, and the coloring is determined by s0. So, two colorings for k=5.

Similarly, for k=6. gcd(6,8)=2. So, two cycles, each of length 4.

Each cycle is i, i+6, i+4, i+2.

Wait, let

---------------

's confirm: starting with i=0: 0,6,4,2.

i=1:1,7,5,3.

So, for each cycle, the

---------------

 four elements must satisfy s_{i+6} = 1 - s_i.

So, for the first cycle: 0,6,4,2.

s6 = 1 - s0

s4 = 1 - s6 = 1 - (1 - s0) = s0

s2 = 1 - s4 = 1 - s0

s0 = 1 - s2 = 1 - (1 - s0) = s0. Consistent.

Similarly, for the second cycle: 1,7,5,3.

s7 = 1 - s1

s5 = 1 - s7 = s1

s3 = 1 - s5 = 1 - s1

s1 = 1 - s3 = 1 - (1 - s1) = s1. Consistent.

So, each cycle is determined by s0 and s1, respectively

---------------

. So, for each cycle, two choices (s0 and s1 can be 0 or 1). So, total colorings is 2^2 =4 for k=6.

For k=7. gcd(7,8)=1, so single

---------------

 cycle.

s_{i+7} = 1 - s_i.

So, similar to k=1,3,5. Let's see:

s7 = 1 - s0

s6 = 1 - s7 = s0

s5 = 1 - s6 = 1 - s0

s4 = 1 - s5 = s0

s3 = 1 - s4 = 1 - s0

s2 = 1 - s3 = s0

s1 = 1 - s2 = 1 - s0

s0 = 1 - s1 = 1 - (1 - s0) = s0. Consistent.

So, again

---------------

, the entire coloring is determined by s0, so two colorings for k=7.

Finally, k=0. That

---------------

's the identity rotation. So, the condition is s_i = 1 - s_i for all i, which implies s_i = 0.5, which is impossible since s_i is either 0 or 1. So, no colorings satisfy the condition for k=0.

So, summar

---------------

izing:

k | gcd(k,8) | Number of colorings for this k
---|---------|---------------------------
0 | 1       | 0
1 | 1       | 2
2 | 2       | 4
3 | 1       | 2
4 | 4       | 16
5 | 1       | 2
6 | 2       | 4
7 | 1       | 2

So, total

---------------

 colorings that satisfy the condition for some k is 0 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 16 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 32.

Wait, 

---------------

2+4=6, +2=8, +16=24, +2=26, +4=30, +2=32. So, 32 colorings.

But wait, but

---------------

 this counts colorings that satisfy the condition for multiple k's multiple times. So, we have overcounted.

For example, a

---------------

 coloring that works for k=1 and k=3 would be counted twice. So, to get the correct count, we need to use inclusion-exclusion, accounting

---------------

 for overlaps.

But this seems complicated. Maybe another approach is to consider that a coloring that works for some rotation is equivalent to the coloring being a

---------------

 fixed point under some rotation composed with the complement operation.

Wait, perhaps we can think in terms of group actions. The group of rotations acts on the set of colorings, and we're looking for colorings that are fixed by some group element combined

---------------

 with the complementation.

But maybe this is getting too abstract.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a necklace counting problem, where we want

---------------

 necklaces that are equivalent to their complement under some rotation.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: For a coloring to satisfy the condition for some rotation k, it must be that the coloring is equal to its complement under rotation by k. So, the

---------------

 coloring is a fixed point of the rotation composed with complementation.

So, the group element is rotation by k, and the transformation is complement

---------------

ation.

Wait, but each rotation is an element of the cyclic group C8, and complementation is an automorphism of the colorings.

So, the group

---------------

 action is the combination of rotation and complementation.

But maybe it's getting too complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the total number of such colorings is equal to the number of colorings fixed by at least one group element (rotation and

---------------

 complementation).

But maybe Burnside's lemma can help here. Let me recall Burnside's lemma: the number of orbits is equal to the average number of fixed points.

But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Wait, in

---------------

 our case, each coloring can be fixed by some rotation k and complementation. So, the number of such colorings is equal to the number of colorings fixed by some rotation and

---------------

 complementation.

So, the total number is the union over all k of the fixed colorings under rotation by k and complementation.

But

---------------

 inclusion-exclusion would be needed, which is complicated.

Alternatively, maybe we can think about the total number of colorings that

---------------

 are fixed by some rotation and complementation.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the number of colorings that satisfy the condition for some k, considering

---------------

 that different k's may lead to overlapping colorings.

Wait, but maybe the only colorings that satisfy the condition for multiple k's are the colorings that are fixed under multiple

---------------

 transformations.

Wait, for example, the all-red and all-blue colorings: would they satisfy the condition for some k?

Wait, let

---------------

's think about the all-red coloring. If we rotate by any k, the coloring remains all-red. The complement of all-red is all-blue, so unless

---------------

 the rotation transforms all-red into all-blue, which is only possible if all-red is equal to all-blue, which is impossible. So, all-red and all-blue colorings are not counted here.

Wait, but

---------------

 the only colorings that are counted are those that are not symmetric in that way.

Wait, but earlier, for k=4, the number of colorings was 16. Let

---------------

 me think about those. For k=4, each pair (i, i+4) must be colored oppositely. So, for

---------------

 each of the four pairs, we can choose either red or blue for the first element, and the other is determined. So, 2^4=16 colorings. These

---------------

 are the colorings where opposite vertices are colored oppositely.

Similarly, for k=2 and k=6, which

---------------

 have two cycles each of length 4, each cycle has two choices, so 4 colorings each.

Wait, but now

---------------

, are any of these colorings fixed under multiple k's? For example, a coloring fixed under both k=2 and k=4.

Wait

---------------

, let's see: If a coloring is fixed under both k=2 and k=4, then it must satisfy both the condition for k=2 and k=4. But

---------------

 let's see what that implies.

If a coloring is fixed under k=4, then s_i and s_{i+4} are complements. If it's also fixed under k=2, then s_i and s_{i+2} are complements.

So, s

---------------

_{i+4} = 1 - s_i, and s_{i+2} = 1 - s_i.

Then

---------------

, s_{i+4} = 1 - s_i = s_{i+2}.

But s_{i+4} = s_{i+2 + 2} = 1 - s_{i+2} = 1 - (1 - s_i) = s_i.

So, s_{i+4} = s_i.

But earlier, we have s_{i+4} = 1 - s_i. So, s_i = 1 - s_i, which implies s_i = 0.5, which is impossible. So, the only colorings that are fixed under both k=2 and k=4 are those that don

---------------

't exist. So, no overlap.

Wait, but maybe another example: a coloring fixed under k=1 and k=3. Wait

---------------

, but if a coloring is fixed under k=1, it's an alternating coloring. If it's also fixed under k=3, what

---------------

 does that imply?

An alternating coloring has s_{i+1} = 1 - s_i. So, s_{i+3} = 1 - s_{i+2} = 1 - (1 - s_{i+1}) = s_{i+1} = 1 - s_i.

So, s_{i+3} = 1 - s_i, which is consistent with the condition for k=3. So, in

---------------

 fact, any alternating coloring is fixed under both k=1 and k=3 and k=5 and k=7. Because shifting

---------------

 by any odd k would result in the same condition.

Wait, so the two alternating colorings (starting with red or blue) are fixed under all odd k's. So, these

---------------

 colorings are counted multiple times in our initial count.

So, in our initial count, for k=1,3,5,7, each contributes

---------------

 2 colorings, but all of these are the same two colorings. So, in reality, the two alternating colorings are each counted four times in the initial total of 32.

Similarly, for

---------------

 other k's, maybe some colorings are fixed under multiple k's.

So, to get the correct count, we need to subtract

---------------

 the overlaps.

This is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to compute the total number of colorings fixed under any rotation and complementation, using inclusion-exclusion.

Alternatively, perhaps we

---------------

 can model this as a linear algebra problem.

Each condition s_{i + k} = 1 - s_i is a linear equation over GF(2), except that it

---------------

's over integers mod 2, but with a twist because it's 1 - s_i, which is equivalent to s_{i +k} + s_i = 1 mod 2.

So, for

---------------

 each rotation k, the system of equations is s_{i +k} + s_i = 1 for all i.

This

---------------

 is a system of 8 equations, but they are not all independent.

The number of solutions is 2^{8 - rank}, where rank is the rank of the system.

But perhaps

---------------

 the system has a certain structure.

Alternatively, maybe we can model it as a graph, where each vertex is connected to its shifted version, and the equations form

---------------

 a set of constraints.

But perhaps another angle: For each rotation k, the system s_{i +k} + s_i = 1 must

---------------

 hold for all i.

So, in terms of linear algebra, the matrix for the system would have 1's on the main diagonal and the k-th shifted diagonal, with the

---------------

 rest 0's, and the right-hand side is all 1's.

But solving such a system might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 we can note that for each rotation k, the number of colorings that satisfy the condition is 2^{c}, where c is the number of independent cycles.

Wait, earlier, we saw that for k=1, the

---------------

 number of solutions is 2, which is 2^1, as the system has one independent equation.

Wait, no

---------------

, for k=1, the system is s_{i+1} + s_i = 1 for all i. But

---------------

 this is a single equation because s0 + s1 =1, s1 + s2=1, etc., which all

---------------

 collapse to s0 = s2 = s4 = s6 and s1 = s3 = s5 = s7, with s0 + s1 =1. So, two

---------------

 solutions.

Similarly, for k=2, the system is s_{i+2} + s_i =1 for all i. So

---------------

, each pair (s0, s2), (s1, s3), etc., must satisfy s_i + s_{i+2}=1. So, each pair is independent, leading to 2^4 =16 solutions,

---------------

 but wait, no, earlier we saw for k=2, it was 4 solutions. Hmm, maybe my earlier approach

---------------

 was wrong.

Wait, no, wait. For k=2, the system is s_{i+2} = 1 - s_i. So, the

---------------

 system is s_{i+2} + s_i =1.

But for each cycle, this is a system that altern

---------------

ates every two steps. So, for a cycle of length 4, the system would be s0 + s2 =1, s2 + s4=1, s4 + s6=1, s6 + s0=1. But

---------------

 this is a system of equations:

s0 + s2 =1

s2 + s4=1

s4 + s6=1

s6 + s0=1

If

---------------

 we add all equations, 2(s0 + s2 + s4 + s6) =4, so s0 + s2 + s4 + s6=2.

But each

---------------

 individual equation is s_{i+2} =1 - s_i.

So, s0, s2, s4, s6 must alternate between

---------------

 two values. So, for a cycle of length 4, s0 determines s2=1 - s0, s4=1 - s2=s0, s6=1 - s4=1 - s0, and then s0=1 - s6=1 - (1 - s0)=s0, which is consistent. So, each cycle is determined by s0, which can be 0 or1, so 2 possibilities.

Since there are two such cycles for k=2, the total number of colorings is 2^2=4.

So

---------------

, that's correct.

Similarly, for k=4, the cycles are of length 2, so each cycle has two elements,

---------------

 which must be complements. So, for each cycle, two possibilities, leading to 2^4=16.

So, in

---------------

 general, for each k, the number of colorings is 2^{d}, where d is the number of cycles.



---------------

Wait, no. For k=2, d=gcd(2,8)=2, so two cycles, each of length 4. But

---------------

 the number of colorings was 4=2^2. Similarly, for k=4, d=4 cycles, each of length 2, number

---------------

 of colorings is 2^4=16.

Wait, yes, so in general, for each k, the number of colorings is 2^{d}, where d is the number of cycles, which is gcd(k,8).

Wait, no

---------------

, for k=1, d=1, so 2^1=2 colorings. For k=3, d=1, so 2 colorings. For k=5,7, same. So, yes

---------------

, for each k, the number of colorings is 2^{gcd(k,8)}.

Wait, but for k=2, the

---------------

 number of colorings was 4=2^2, which is 2^{gcd(2,8)}=2^2=4. Similarly, k=4, 2^4=16. So, yes, that

---------------

 seems to hold.

So, the formula is that for each k, the number of colorings is 2^{gcd(k,8)}.

So

---------------

, to compute the total number of colorings fixed by at least one rotation, we can sum over k=0 to 7 the number of colorings fixed by rotation k, which is 2^{gcd(k,8)}.

But wait, no

---------------

, because we have to consider that the colorings fixed by multiple k's are being counted multiple times.

So, the total number is not just the sum, but the inclusion-exclusion over all k's.

But that

---------------

's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of the total number as the sum over k of μ(k) * 2^{gcd(k,8)}, where μ is the Möbius function. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using

---------------

 the principle from combinatorics that the number of colorings fixed by at least one group element is equal to the sum over the group of the number of fixed colorings, divided by the size of the group.

---------------

 But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can use Möbius inversion here.

Wait, the total number of colorings fixed by some rotation is equal to the sum_{d|8} μ(d) * something.

Wait, maybe

---------------

 not. Let me think differently.

The problem is similar to counting the number of binary necklaces of length 8 that are equal to their complement under some rotation.

In

---------------

 combinatorics, a necklace is an equivalence class of colorings under rotation. But in our case, we're not considering equivalence classes; we're considering colorings that are fixed by some rotation composed with complementation.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 another approach: for each divisor d of 8, consider the number of colorings that are periodic with period d and satisfy the condition.

But maybe that

---------------

's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the total number of colorings is equal to the sum over all divisors d of 8 of φ(d) * 2^{d}, where φ is Euler's totient function.

Wait, but

---------------

 I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I need to compute the number of colorings fixed by at least one rotation k,

---------------

 considering that each rotation k contributes 2^{gcd(k,8)} colorings, but with overlaps.

But this is similar

---------------

 to the problem of counting the number of binary strings fixed by some rotation, which is a classic necklace counting problem.

In the necklace problem, the number of aperiodic necklaces is given by Möbius inversion. But in our case, the condition is more complex because it's not just fixed by rotation, but fixed by rotation and complementation.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 it's better to model this as a group action. The group is C8, the cyclic group of order 8, acting on the set of colorings. But

---------------

 each group element is combined with complementation.

Wait, but complementation is an involution (applying it twice gives the identity). So, the group is actually the dihedral group, which includes rotations and reflections. But in our case, the

---------------

 complementation is a global operation, not a reflection.

Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps think of the problem as color

---------------

ings that are fixed under some rotation followed by complementation.

In that case, the group is C8, and the transformation is rotation

---------------

 by k and then complementation. So, for each k, we can define an automorphism T_k: s_i → 1 - s_{(i -k) mod 8}.

Then, the fixed colorings under T_k are those color

---------------

ings s such that s_i = 1 - s_{(i -k) mod 8} for all i.

Which is equivalent to s_{(i +k) mod8} = 1 - s_i for all i.

Which is exactly the condition we had earlier.

So, the

---------------

 number of fixed colorings under T_k is 2^{gcd(k,8)}.

So, to compute the total number of colorings fixed by at least one T_k, we can use inclusion-exclusion over the group.

But in

---------------

 group theory, the number of elements fixed by at least one group element can be computed using the formula:

Total = sum_{g} fix(g) - sum_{g1 < g2} fix(g1 ∩ g2) + sum_{g1 < g2 < g3} fix(g1 ∩ g2 ∩ g3) - ... 

But this is complicated for a group of size 8.

Alternatively, perhaps we

---------------

 can use Burnside's lemma, but I'm not sure.

Wait, Burnside's lemma counts the number of orbits, which is equal to the average number of fixed points. But in our case, we want the total number of colorings fixed by at least one group element, not the number of orbits.

Wait

---------------

, but Burnside's lemma says that the number of orbits is equal to (1/|G|) * sum_{g ∈ G} fix(g). So, the

---------------

 average number of fixed colorings per group element is equal to the number of orbits.

But we don't know the number of orbits.

---------------

 Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of the total number of colorings fixed by at least one group element as equal to the sum_{g ∈ G} fix(g) minus the sum over pairs, etc., but this inclusion-exclusion is complicated

---------------

.

Alternatively, perhaps note that the only colorings fixed by multiple group elements are the all-red and all-blue, but in

---------------

 our case, those are not fixed because their complements are all-blue and all-red, respectively, which are different.

Wait, no

---------------

. Wait, all-red coloring: if you rotate it by any k, it's still all-red. Its complement is all-blue. So, unless all-red is equal to all-blue, which it isn't, the

---------------

 all-red coloring is not fixed under any T_k. Similarly for all-blue.

So, the only colorings fixed under T_k are those non-trivial colorings.

Wait, but earlier

---------------

, for k=1,3,5,7, the number of fixed colorings is 2, which are the two alternating colorings. These

---------------

 are fixed under all T_k where k is odd.

Similarly, for k=2,6, the fixed colorings are the ones with two

---------------

 alternating colors every two steps, which are fixed under T_2 and T_6.

Similarly, for k=4, the fixed colorings are those with opposite vertices colored oppositely, fixed under T_4.

So, these

---------------

 colorings are fixed under multiple T_k's.

So, the two alternating colorings are fixed under T_1, T_3, T_5, T_7.

The four colorings for k=2 and k=6 are fixed under T_2 and T_6.

The 16 colorings for k=4 are fixed under T_4.

So, to

---------------

 compute the total number of colorings fixed by at least one T_k, we can take the union over all fixed colorings.

But since

---------------

 some colorings are fixed under multiple T_k's, we have to subtract the overlaps.

So, using inclusion-exclusion:

Total = sum fix(T_k) - sum fix(T_k ∩ T_{k'}) + sum fix(T_k ∩ T_{k'} ∩ T_{k''}) - ... 

But this is going

---------------

 to get very complicated because there are many overlaps.

But perhaps we can compute the total number as follows:

First, sum over all k:

---------------

 fix(T_k) = sum_{k=0}^7 2^{gcd(k,8)}.

But for k=0, fix(T_0) = 0, as we

---------------

 saw earlier.

For k=1,3,5,7: each contributes 2 colorings.

For k=2,6: each contributes 4 colorings.

For k=4: contributes 16 colorings.

So, total sum is 0 + 2 + 4 + 2 +16 + 2 +4 +2 = 32.

But this counts colorings that are fixed under multiple T_k's multiple times.

So, we need to subtract the colorings fixed under the intersection of two T_k's.

So

---------------

, for example, colorings fixed under both T_1 and T_3.

But if a coloring is fixed under T_1 and T_3, what does that imply?

Fixed

---------------

 under T_1: s_{i+1} = 1 - s_i.

Fixed under T_3: s_{i+3} = 1 - s_i.

But from T_1, s_{i+1} = 1 - s_i.

Then, s_{i+3} = s_{i+2 +1} = 1 - s_{i+2} = 1 - (1 - s_{i+1}) ) = s_{i+1} = 1 - s_i.

Which is consistent with T_3. So, any coloring fixed under T_1 is automatically fixed under T_3, T_5, T_7.

Similarly, the two alternating colorings are fixed under all T_k with odd k.

So, the

---------------

 intersection of fix(T_1) and fix(T_3) is fix(T_1), which has 2 colorings.

Similarly, the intersection of fix(T_1) and fix(T_2) would be colorings fixed under both T_1 and T_2.

But what

---------------

 does that imply?

If a coloring is fixed under T_1 and T_2, then:

From T_1: s_{i+1} = 1 - s_i.

From T_2: s_{i+2} = 1 - s_i.

But from T_1: s_{i+2} = s_{i+1 +1} = 1 - s_{i+1} = 1 - (1 - s_i) = s_i.

But from T_2: s_{i+2} = 1 - s_i.

So, s_i = 1 - s_i, which implies s_i = 0.5, which is impossible. So, the intersection of fix(T_1) and fix(T_2) is empty.

Similarly, the

---------------

 intersection of fix(T_2) and fix(T_6) would be colorings fixed under both T_2 and T_6.

But

---------------

 T_2 and T_6 are related because T_6 is T_{-2}.

So, if a coloring is fixed under T_2 and T_6, what does that imply?

From

---------------

 T_2: s_{i+2} = 1 - s_i.

From T_6: s_{i+6} = 1 - s_i.

But s_{i+6} = s_{i + 2*3} = (1 - s_{i + 2*2}) =

---------------

 1 - s_{i +4} = 1 - (1 - s_{i +2}) ) = s_{i +2} = 1 - s_i.

Which is consistent. So, the

---------------

 colorings fixed under both T_2 and T_6 are the same as those fixed under T_2. So, the intersection is fix(T_2), which has 4 colorings.

Wait, but wait

---------------

, if a coloring is fixed under T_2, then it's automatically fixed under T_6, since T_6 is T_2 composed with T_4 (since

---------------

 2+4=6, but not sure if that's accurate). Alternatively, since T_6 is the inverse of T_2, because 2 + 6 =8 ≡0 mod8. So, T_6 is the inverse of T_2. So, if a coloring is fixed under T_2, it's also fixed under T_6.

So, the intersection of fix(T_2) and fix(T_6) is fix(T_2), which has 4 colorings.

Similarly, the intersection of fix(T_4) with any other fix(T_k) would be fix

---------------

(T_4), since T_4 is of order 2, and any rotation by k=4 composed with itself gives identity.

Wait, no

---------------

. Let's see, if a coloring is fixed under T_4 and T_2, what does that imply?

From T_4: s_{i+4} =1 - s_i.

From T_2: s_{i+2} =1 - s_i.

But then, s_{i+4} = (s_{i+2}) +

---------------

 something. Wait, s_{i+4} =1 - s_i, and s_{i+2}=1 - s_i. So, s_{i+4}=s_{i+2}.

But s_{i+4} = s_{i+2} implies

---------------

 that the coloring is periodic with period 2. But from T_2, s_{i+2}=1 - s_i. So, combining these, s_{i+4}=s_{i+2}=1 - s_i, and s_{i+4}=1 - s_i. So, it

---------------

's consistent.

But then, s_{i+2} =1 - s_i and s_{i+4}=1 - s_i.

---------------

 So, s_{i+2}=s_{i+4}, which is consistent with the period.

So, the colorings fixed under both T_2 and T_4 are the same as those fixed under T_2, which are 4 colorings.

Similarly, the colorings fixed under T_4 and T_1 would be the

---------------

 intersection of fix(T_4) and fix(T_1). But fix(T_1) is the two alternating colorings, which are not fixed under T_4 because T_4 would require s_{i+4}=1 - s_i. But for the alternating colorings, s_{i+4}=s_i. So, s_i =1 - s_i → s_i=0.5, impossible. So, the intersection is empty.

So, the

---------------

 overlaps are only within certain subsets.

This is getting quite involved. Maybe instead of trying to compute the exact number via inclusion-exclusion, which is complicated

---------------

, I can instead note that the only colorings that are fixed under multiple T_k's are:

- The two alternating colorings, fixed under all T_k where k is odd.

- The four colorings fixed under T_2 and T_6.

- The 16 colorings fixed under T_4.

But

---------------

 these sets are mostly disjoint except for overlaps where colorings satisfy multiple conditions.

Wait, for example, are any of the colorings fixed under T_4 also fixed under T_2?

A

---------------

 coloring fixed under T_4 has s_{i+4}=1 - s_i.

A coloring fixed under T_2 has s_{i+2}=1 - s_i.

So, if a coloring is fixed under both, then s_{i+2}=1 - s_i and s_{i+4}=1 - s_i.

But s_{i+4}=s_{i+2 +2}=1 - s_{i+2}=1 - (1 - s_i)=s_i.

But s_{i+4}=1 - s_i, so s_i=1 - s_i, which implies s_i=0.5, impossible. So, no overlap between fix(T_4) and fix(T_2).

Similarly, the two alternating colorings are not in fix(T_4), as we saw earlier.

So, the only overlaps are within the fix(T_1), fix(T_3), etc., which all share the same two colorings.

Similarly, fix(T_2) and fix(T_6) share the same four colorings.

So, the

---------------

 total number of colorings fixed by at least one T_k is:

Number of colorings fixed by any T_k = |fix(T_1) ∪ fix(T_2) ∪ fix(T_3) ∪ ... ∪ fix(T_7)|.

Using

---------------

 inclusion-exclusion:

= sum |fix(T_k)| - sum |fix(T_k) ∩ fix(T_{k'})| + sum |fix(T_k) ∩ fix(T_{k'}) ∩ fix(T_{k''})| - ... 

But this

---------------

 is going to be complicated because there are many terms.

But perhaps we can compute the first few terms.

First, sum |fix(T_k)| = 0 + 2 + 4 + 2 +16 + 2 +4 +2 = 32.

Now, subtract the intersections. The intersections can be of two types:

1. Intersections of fix(T_k) where k is odd: fix

---------------

(T_1) ∩ fix(T_3) = fix(T_1), which has 2 colorings.

Similarly, fix(T_1) ∩ fix(T_5) = fix(T_1), etc. So

---------------

, how many such intersections are there?

There are C(4,2)=6 intersections among the four odd k's. Each intersection is fix(T_1), which has 2 colorings. So, total for these is 6 * 2 =12.

2. Intersections of fix(T_2) and fix(T_6): fix(T_2) ∩ fix(T_6) = fix(T_2), which has 4 colorings. So, 

---------------

1 intersection, contributing 4.

3. Intersections between fix(T_odd) and fix(T_2 or T_6): For example, fix(T_1) ∩ fix(T_2). As we saw earlier, this intersection is empty. So, each

---------------

 such intersection contributes 0.

Similarly, any intersection between fix(T_odd) and fix(T_4) is empty.

4. Intersections of fix(T_2) with itself: Not

---------------

 applicable since we're considering distinct pairs.

5. Intersections of fix(T_4) with others: As above, these

---------------

 are empty.

So, total intersections to subtract are 12 (from odd k's) + 4 (from T_2 and T_6) =16.

Now, moving to the next term: sum of intersections of three fix(T_k)'s.

Again

---------------

, similar reasoning:

1. Intersections among three fix(T_odd)'s: Each such intersection is fix(T_1), which has 2 colorings. The number of such intersections is C(4,3)=4, each contributing 2. So, total 4*2=8.

2. Intersections involving fix(T_2) and two fix(T_odd)'s: For example, fix(T_1) ∩ fix(T_3) ∩ fix(T_2). As before, fix(T_1) ∩ fix(T_2)=empty, so the intersection is empty.

3. Similarly, intersections involving fix(T_2) and fix(T_6) with another fix(T_odd): The

---------------

 intersection would be empty.

4. Intersections involving fix(T_4) with others: These are empty.

So, total for three-way intersections is 8.

Next term: sum of intersections of four fix(T_k)'s.

1. Intersections of all four fix(T_odd)'s: This is fix(T_1), which has 2 colorings. Only 1 such intersection.

2. Other four-way intersections involving fix(T_2), fix(T_6), or fix(T_4) would be empty.

So, total four-way intersections: 2.

Now

---------------

, higher-order intersections (five or more fix(T_k)'s) would also be empty, as the intersections beyond four are already

---------------

 empty.

Putting it all together:

Total = sum fix(T_k) - sum |fix(T_k) ∩ fix(T_{k'})| + sum |fix(T_k) ∩ fix(T_{k'}) ∩ fix(T_{k''})| - sum |fix(T_k) ∩ ... | + ...

So,

Total = 32 - 16 + 8 - 2 = 32 -16=16; 16+8=24; 24-2=22.

Wait, is

---------------

 that correct? Let me double-check:

First term: 32

Subtract second term (intersections of two fix(T_k)'s): 16

Add back third term (intersections of three fix(T_k)'s):8

Subtract fourth term (intersections of four fix(T_k)'s):2

So, 32 -16=16; 16+8=24; 24-2=22.

So, the total number of colorings fixed by at least one T_k is 22.

But wait, earlier

---------------

 I thought the total was 32, but after inclusion-exclusion, it's 22.

But let's see

---------------

: 32 (sum fix(T_k)) -16 (sum pairwise intersections) +8 (sum triple intersections) -2 (sum four-way intersections) = 22.

But is

---------------

 this the correct count? Let me think.

We have:

- 2 colorings fixed under all odd k's.

- 4 colorings fixed under T_2 and T_6.

- 16 colorings fixed under T_4.

But these

---------------

 sets are mostly disjoint except for overlaps within the odd k's.

Wait, the 2 colorings are fixed under all odd k's. The 4 colorings under T_2 and T_6 are separate. The 16 colorings under T_4 are separate.

So, the

---------------

 total colorings would be 2 +4 +16=22. Which matches our inclusion-exclusion result.

So, the total number is 22.

But wait, earlier

---------------

, when we summed all fix(T_k), we got 32, which counts overlaps multiple times. So, inclusion-exclusion reduces

---------------

 it to 22.

So, the number of colorings that satisfy the condition is 22.

But wait, let

---------------

 me verify with another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the number is 22, but let me think about the possible colorings:

- 2 colorings fixed

---------------

 under T_1, T_3, T_5, T_7.

- 4 colorings fixed under T_2 and T_6.

- 16 colorings fixed under T_4.

But

---------------

 these sets are pairwise disjoint except for the 2 colorings which are fixed under T_1, etc., but they are not in the other sets.

So, total colorings: 2 +4 +16=22.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, the number of colorings is 22.

But

---------------

 wait, wait a second. The problem says that the probability is m/n, where m and n are coprime. So, the

---------------

 total number of colorings is 256.

So, the probability is 22/256. Simplify that: divide numerator and denominator by 2, 11/128.

So, m=11, n=128, which are coprime. So, m +n=139.

Wait, but hold

---------------

 on. Earlier, I thought the number of colorings was 22, but I need to make sure.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I made a mistake in inclusion-exclusion. Let me recount.

The inclusion-exclusion formula for the union is:

|A1 ∪ A2 ∪ ... ∪ An| = Σ|Ai| - Σ|Ai ∩ Aj| + Σ|Ai ∩ Aj ∩ Ak| - ... + (-1)^{n+1} |A1 ∩ A2 ∩ ... ∩ An}|.

In our case, the sets Ai are fix(T_k) for k=0 to7, but fix(T_0)=0, so we can ignore it.

So, the sets

---------------

 are fix(T_1), fix(T_2), fix(T_3), fix(T_4), fix(T_5), fix(T_6), fix(T_7).

So

---------------

, n=7 sets.

So, the first term is sum |Ai|: 2+4+2+16+2+4+2=32.

Second term: sum |Ai ∩ Aj| for i<j.

There

---------------

 are C(7,2)=21 intersections.

But many of them are empty.

Let me categorize the intersections:

1. Intersections among fix(T_odd): There

---------------

 are C(4,2)=6 intersections. Each intersection is fix(T_1), which has 2 colorings.

2. Intersections between fix(T_2) and fix(T_6): 1 intersection, which is fix(T_2), 4 colorings.

3. Intersections between fix(T_odd) and fix(T_2): Each

---------------

 of these is empty, as we saw earlier. There are 4*1=4 such intersections.

4. Intersections between fix(T_odd) and fix(T_4): Each is empty. 4*1=4 intersections.

5. Intersections between fix(T_2) and fix(T_4): Empty, as we

---------------

 saw earlier. 1 intersection.

6. Intersections between fix(T_6) and fix(T_4): Empty, as fix(T_6) is same as fix(T_2). 1 intersection.

7. Intersections between fix(T_5) and fix(T_6): Empty. 

---------------

1 intersection.

Wait, actually, this is getting too messy. Let me instead compute all pairwise intersections:

- fix(T_1) ∩ fix(T_2): empty.

- fix(T_1) ∩ fix(T_3): fix(T_1), 2.

- fix(T_1) ∩ fix(T_4): empty.

- fix(T_1) ∩ fix(T_5): fix(T_1), 2.

- fix(T_1) ∩ fix(T_6): empty.

- fix(T_1) ∩ fix(T_7): fix(T_1), 2.

Similarly:

- fix(T_2) ∩ fix(T_3): empty.

- fix(T_2) ∩ fix(T_4): empty.

- fix(T_2) ∩ fix(T_5): empty.

- fix(T_2) ∩ fix(T_6): fix(T_2),4.

- fix(T_2) ∩ fix(T_7): empty.

- fix(T_3) ∩ fix(T_4): empty.

- fix(T_3) ∩ fix(T_5): fix(T_3),2.

- fix(T_3) ∩ fix(T_6): empty.

- fix(T_3) ∩ fix(T_7): fix(T_3),2.

- fix(T_4) ∩ fix(T_5): empty.

- fix(T_4) ∩ fix(T_6): empty.

- fix(T_4) ∩ fix(T_7): empty.

- fix(T_5) ∩ fix(T_6): empty.

- fix(T_5) ∩ fix(T_7): fix(T_5),2.

- fix(T_6) ∩ fix(T_7): empty.

So, now

---------------

, counting the non-empty intersections:

- fix(T_1) ∩ fix(T_3):2

- fix(T_1) ∩ fix(T_5):2

- fix(T_1) ∩ fix(T_7):2

- fix(T_2) ∩ fix(T_6):4

- fix(T_3) ∩ fix(T_5):2

- fix(T_3) ∩ fix(T_7):2

- fix(T_5) ∩ fix(T_7):2

So, total non-empty intersections: 2+2+2+4+2+2+2=16.

So, sum |Ai ∩ Aj|=16.

Third

---------------

 term: sum |Ai ∩ Aj ∩ Ak| for i<j<k.

Again, categorizing:

1. Intersections among three fix(T_odd)'s: Each

---------------

 such intersection is fix(T_1), which has 2 colorings. The number of such intersections is C(4,3)=4.

2. Intersections involving fix(T_2), fix(T_6), and a fix(T_odd): For example, fix(T_1) ∩ fix(T_2) ∩ fix(T_3)=empty.

3. Intersections involving fix(T_4) and others: These

---------------

 are empty.

So, total for three-way intersections:4 *2=8.

Fourth term: sum |Ai ∩ Aj ∩ Ak ∩ Al| for i<j<k<l.

Only one such intersection: fix(T_1) ∩ fix(T_3) ∩ fix(T_5) ∩ fix(T_7)=fix(T_1), which has 2 colorings.

So

---------------

, sum four-way intersections=2.

Now, higher-order intersections (five or more) are empty.

Putting it all together:

Total = 32 (first term) -16 (second term) +8 (third term) -2 (fourth term) = 32 -16=16; 16+8=24; 24-2=22.

So, the total number of colorings fixed by at least one T_k is 22.

Thus, the probability is 22/256. Simplify this fraction:

Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 11/128.

11 and 128 are coprime, so m=11, n=128. Thus, m +n=139.

Wait, but earlier

---------------

 when I thought about the colorings fixed under each k, I thought the total was 22, which aligns with this calculation. So, I think this is correct.

So, the answer is 139.


The probability that a randomly colored regular octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices align with original red vertices is $\frac{11}{128}$. Therefore, $m + n = 11 + 128 = 139$.

$\boxed{139}$<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
