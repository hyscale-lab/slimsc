Okay, so I have this math problem here about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. Let me try to wrap my head around it.

The problem says that for a given integer b (which is at least 2), a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. 



---------------

The example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because when you write 81 in base 13, it's 63 (

---------------

since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is sqrt(81). That

---------------

 makes sense.

The task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, I need to figure out for each base b, how many numbers n satisfy the two conditions, and find the smallest b where this count exceeds ten.

Let me break it down. First

---------------

, let's understand what it means for a number n to have exactly two digits in base b. In base b, the two-digit numbers range from b^1 to b^2 - 1. Specifically, a two-digit number in base b is of the form d1*d2, where d1 is the first digit (from

---------------

 the left) and d2 is the second digit. Here, d1 can be from 1 to b-1, and d2 can be from 0 to b-1. So, n can be written as d1 * b + d2.

The second condition is that the sum of these two digits, d1 + d2, equals sqrt(n). So, sqrt

---------------

(n) must be an integer because d1 and d2 are integers, right? Because sqrt(n) is the sum of two integers, it must itself be an integer. Therefore, n must be a perfect square.

Wait, that

---------------

's an important point. So n is a perfect square, and in base b, it's a two-digit number. So

---------------

, n = k^2, where k is an integer, and n is in the range [b, b^2 - 1]. So

---------------

, k must be such that b ≤ k^2 ≤ b^2 - 1.

Also, since n is a two-digit number in base b, n

---------------

 = d1*b + d2, where d1 is between 1 and b-1, and d2 is between 0 and b-1. So

---------------

, d1 + d2 = k.

So, putting it all together, we have:

1. n = k^2
2. n = d1*b + d2
3. d1 + d2 = k
4. 1 ≤ d1 ≤ b-1
5. 0 ≤ d2 ≤ b-1

So, substit

---------------

uting equation 3 into equation 2:

k^2 = d1*b + (k - d1)  [since d2 = k - d1]

Simplify that:

k^2 = d1*b + k - d1

Bring

---------------

 all terms to one side:

k^2 - k = d1*(b - 1)

So, d1 = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1)

Hmm, so

---------------

 d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1. Therefore, (k^2 - k) must be divisible by (b - 1), and the result must be an integer between 1 and b-1.

So

---------------

, (k^2 - k) mod (b - 1) = 0, and 1 ≤ (k^2 - k)/(b - 1) ≤ b-1.

Let

---------------

 me denote m = b - 1. Then, d1 = (k^2 - k)/m, and 1 ≤ d1 ≤ m.

So, m

---------------

 must be a divisor of k(k - 1). Also, d1 must be between 1 and m.

So, for each base b, m = b - 1, and we can find

---------------

 all k such that m divides k(k - 1), and d1 = (k^2 - k)/m is between 1 and m.

Moreover

---------------

, n = k^2 must be a two-digit number in base b, so n must be between b and b^2 - 1.

So

---------------

, b ≤ k^2 ≤ b^2 - 1.

But since b = m + 1, we can write this

---------------

 as:

m + 1 ≤ k^2 ≤ (m + 1)^2 - 1.

Expanding (m+1)^2 -1:

(m + 1)^2 - 1 = m^2 + 2m + 1 -1 = m^2 + 2m.

So, m + 1 ≤ k^2 ≤ m^2 + 2m.

Taking

---------------

 square roots:

sqrt(m + 1) ≤ k ≤ sqrt(m^2 + 2m).

But sqrt(m^2 + 2m) is approximately m + 1, but let's compute it exactly:

sqrt(m^2 + 2m) = m * sqrt(1 + 2/m) ≈ m + 1 for large m, but for

---------------

 exactness, perhaps it's better to keep it as is.

But wait, let's see. For each m, which

---------------

 is b - 1, we need to find k such that:

1. m divides k(k - 1)
2. 1 ≤ d1 = (k^2 - k)/m ≤ m
3. m + 1 ≤ k^2 ≤ m^2 + 2m

Wait, that

---------------

's a lot of conditions. Maybe I can approach this differently.

Let me try to think about the possible values of k for

---------------

 a given m. Since k^2 must be a two-digit number in base b, which is m + 1, so

---------------

 k^2 must be between m + 1 and (m + 1)^2 - 1.

Which is the

---------------

 same as:

sqrt(m + 1) ≤ k ≤ sqrt(m^2 + 2m).

But sqrt(m^2 + 2m) is sqrt

---------------

(m(m + 2)), which is between m and m + 1.

Wait, actually, let's compute sqrt(m^2 + 2m). Let me consider

---------------

 m^2 + 2m = (m + 1)^2 -1. So, sqrt(m^2 + 2m) = sqrt((m + 1)^2 -1) < m + 1.

So, k must be an integer such that:

sqrt(m + 1) ≤ k ≤ m + 1 - ε, where ε is a small positive number.



---------------

But since k must be integer, the maximum k is m.

Wait, let's see:

Wait, (m + 1)^2 = m^2 + 2m + 1, so (m + 1)^2 - 1 = m^2 + 2m.

So, k^2 must be ≤ m^2 + 2m, so k ≤ sqrt(m^2 + 2m) < m + 1.

Therefore

---------------

, k can be at most m.

Wait, because k is integer, so k ≤ m.

Similarly, the lower bound: k ≥ sqrt(m + 1).

So, for each m, k can range from ceil(sqrt(m + 1)) up to m.

But

---------------

 k must also satisfy that m divides k(k - 1), and that d1 = (k^2 - k)/m is between 1 and m.

Wait

---------------

, but since d1 = (k^2 -k)/m, and m divides k(k -1), so d1 is an integer.

Additionally

---------------

, since d1 must be at least 1, we have:

(k^2 - k)/m ≥ 1 ⇒ k^2 - k ≥ m.

But m = b - 1, and b

---------------

 = m +1. So, k^2 -k ≥ m.

But since k can be up to m, let

---------------

's substitute k = m:

m^2 - m ≥ m ⇒ m^2 - 2m ≥ 0 ⇒ m(m - 2) ≥ 0.

So, for m ≥ 2, this holds. For

---------------

 m =1, m^2 - 2m =1 -2= -1 <0. So, for m=1, k

---------------

^2 -k must be ≥1. So, for m=1, k^2 -k ≥1. But

---------------

 k can be up to m=1, so k=1: 1 -1=0, which is less than 1. So, m=1 has

---------------

 no solutions. So, for m=1, no b-eautiful numbers.

But let's not get bogged down here

---------------

. Let me try to think about how to model this.

For each m ≥1, we can find the number of k's such that:

1. m divides k(k -1)
2. 1 ≤ (k^2 -k)/m ≤ m
3. ceil(sqrt(m +1)) ≤k ≤ m

And

---------------

 then, for each m, count the number of such k's, which would correspond to the number of b-eautiful numbers for b = m +1.

We

---------------

 need to find the smallest m +1 such that the count exceeds ten.

So, perhaps we can approach this by iterating over m starting from 1 upwards, for

---------------

 each m, compute the number of valid k's, and find the smallest m where this count is >10.

But

---------------

 doing this manually for each m might be time-consuming, so maybe I can find a pattern or a formula.

Let me think

---------------

: m divides k(k -1). Since m = b -1, and k is in the range [ceil(sqrt(m +1)), m].

Given

---------------

 that m divides k(k -1), which is two consecutive integers, so k and k-1 are coprime. Therefore, m must be a product of two factors, one dividing k and the other dividing k-1.

So

---------------

, m can be factored into two coprime factors, say, a and b, such that a divides k and b divides k -1, and a*b = m.

Therefore

---------------

, for each m, the number of solutions k is equal to the number of ways to write m as a product of two coprime factors a and b, with a ≤ b, and then solving

---------------

 for k ≡ 0 mod a and k ≡1 mod b.

But since k is in the range [ceil(sqrt(m +1)), m], perhaps

---------------

 for each factorization of m into a*b, coprime, we can find the number of solutions for k in that range.

Wait

---------------

, this seems a bit abstract, but maybe manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that since m divides k(k -1), then k

---------------

 ≡0 or 1 mod m's factors.

Wait, perhaps not. Maybe let's think about m as a product of primes

---------------

.

Alternatively, perhaps for each m, the number of k's is equal to the number of divisors d of m such that d divides k and (m/d) divides (k -1), or

---------------

 vice versa. Since m = a*b, with a and b coprime, then for each such pair, we can solve the congruence k ≡0 mod a and k ≡1 mod b.

But

---------------

 I think this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps for each m, the number of k's is equal to the number of divisors t of m such that t ≤

---------------

 k and (m/t) divides (k -1).

Wait, maybe I should think about the equation d1 = (k^2 -k)/m.

Since d1 must be between 1 and m, we

---------------

 have:

1 ≤ (k^2 -k)/m ≤ m.

So,

m ≤ k^2 -k ≤ m^2.

Which

---------------

 can be rewritten as:

k^2 -k -m ≥0,

and

k^2 -k -m^2 ≤0.

So

---------------

, solving k^2 -k -m ≥0:

Using quadratic formula:

k = [1 ± sqrt(1 +4m)]/2.

Since k is positive, we take the positive root:

k ≥ [1 + sqrt(1 +4m)]/2.

Similarly, solving k^2 -k -m^2 ≤0:

k ≤ [1 + sqrt(1 +4m^2)]/2.

But since

---------------

 m is positive, sqrt(1 +4m^2) is approximately 2m, so [1 + sqrt(1 +4m^2)]/2 ≈ m + 1/(4m), which is just a bit more than m. So, since k must be integer, k ≤ m.

So, k

---------------

 must satisfy:

ceil([1 + sqrt(1 +4m)]/2) ≤k ≤m.

Additionally, m

---------------

 divides k(k -1). So, for each m, we can iterate k from that lower bound to m, and check if m divides k(k -1). The

---------------

 number of such k's would be the number of b-eautiful numbers for base b = m +1.

So, perhaps

---------------

 the way to proceed is to iterate m starting from 1 upwards, for each m, compute the lower bound for k, then iterate k from that lower bound up to m, and count how many k's satisfy m divides k(k -1). Then, for

---------------

 each m, if the count exceeds 10, we can note the corresponding b = m +1 as a candidate.

But since the

---------------

 problem is asking for the minimal b where the count exceeds ten, I need to find the smallest m +1 where the count is >10.

But

---------------

 doing this manually for each m is going to take a lot of time. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the

---------------

 number of k's for a given m is equal to the number of divisors of m. Wait, not exactly, because it's not

---------------

 just any divisor, but a pair of coprime divisors.

Wait, considering that m divides k(k -1), and since k and k -1 are coprime, m must be a product of two coprime factors, one dividing k, the other dividing k -1.

Therefore, for each pair

---------------

 of coprime divisors (a, b) of m with a*b = m, there is a unique solution modulo m to the system:

k ≡0 mod a,

k ≡1 mod b.

By

---------------

 the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since a and b are coprime, there is a unique solution modulo m.

Therefore, for each such pair (a, b), there is exactly one k modulo m that satisfies these conditions. But

---------------

 since we are looking for k in the range [ceil([1 + sqrt(1 +4m)]/2), m], the

---------------

 number of solutions depends on whether this k falls within that interval.

But this is getting a bit too abstract. Maybe an example would help.

Take m =6 (so b=7). Let's compute the number of k's.

First, compute

---------------

 the lower bound for k:

sqrt(m +1) = sqrt(7) ≈ 2.645, so ceil(2.645) =3.

So k ranges from 3 to 6.

Now, for each k from 3 to6, check if 6 divides k(k -1).

k=3: 3*2=6, which is divisible by6. So yes. So d1=(9 -3)/6=6/6=1. Which is valid since d1=1.



---------------

k=4:4*3=12, which is divisible by6. d1=(16-4)/6=12/6=2, which is valid.

k=5:5*4=20, which is not divisible by6 (20/6=3.333). So no.

k=6:6*5=30, which is divisible by6. d1=(36 -6)/6=30/6=5, which is valid.

So, for m=6, there are three k's:3,4,6. So three b=7-eautiful numbers.

But

---------------

 wait, let's verify:

For k=3: n=9. In base7, 9 is 12 (1*7 +2=9). The digits are 1 and 2, sum is3, which is sqrt(9). So yes.

For k=4: n=16. In base7, 16 is 22 (2*7 +2=16). Sum is4, which is sqrt(16). So

---------------

 yes.

For k=6: n=36. In base7, 36 is 51 (5*7 +1=36). Sum is5+1=6, sqrt(36)=6. So yes.

So that's three numbers.

So

---------------

, for m=6, count is3.

Wait, but in the range k=3 to6, we had k=3,4,6.

---------------

 So three numbers.

Hmm.

So, perhaps for each m, the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to write m as a product of two coprime factors a and b, such

---------------

 that a divides k and b divides (k -1). Each such pair (a,b) gives a solution for k.



---------------

Since m can be written as a product of coprime pairs (a,b), the number of such pairs is 2^{number of prime factors of m}, but

---------------

 since (a,b) and (b,a) are different unless a=b, but since a and b are coprime, unless

---------------

 m=1.

Wait, no, actually, for each factorization into coprime a and b, a*b =m, we

---------------

 have two possibilities unless a=b. But since a and b are coprime, a and b can only be equal if a=b=1. So, the number of such pairs is 2^{number

---------------

 of distinct prime factors of m}.

Wait, for example, m=6, which has prime factors 2 and3. So, number of coprime pairs (a,b) is 2^2=4.

---------------

 But for m=6, the factorizations into coprime pairs are (1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1). But in

---------------

 reality, each unordered pair is unique, so for m=6, the number of unordered coprime pairs is 2.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the number of coprime ordered pairs is 2^{number of prime factors}.

But perhaps I should think differently.

Wait

---------------

, in any case, for each m, the number of solutions k is equal to the number of coprime pairs (a,b) such that a*b=m.

But

---------------

 I'm getting stuck here. Maybe another approach is better.

Let me try to compute for small m and see the pattern.

Compute

---------------

 for m from 1 to, say, 20, and see how the counts go.

Starting with m=1:

m=1:

Compute

---------------

 lower bound k: sqrt(2)≈1.414, ceil=2. But k must be ≤1. So no solutions. Count=0.

m=2:

sqrt(3)=1.732, ceil=2. So k ranges from 2 to2.

Check if 2 divides k(k -1). For k=2: 2*1=2, which is divisible by2. So yes. d1=(4 -2)/2=2/2=1. Valid.

So count=1.

m=3:

sqrt(4)=2. So k=2,3.

Check k=2: 2*1=2. Does 3 divide 2? No.

k=3:3*2=6. 3 divides6? Yes. d1=(9 -3)/3=6/3=2. Valid.

So count=1.

m=4:

sqrt(5)=~2.236, ceil=3. So k=3,4.

k=3:3*2=6. 4 divides6? No.

k=4:4*3=12. 4 divides12? Yes. d1=(16 -4)/4=12/4=3. Valid.

Count=1.

Wait, but wait

---------------

: is k=3 valid?

n=9. In base5, 9 is 14 (1*5 +4=9). Sum 

---------------

1+4=5, which is not equal to sqrt(9)=3. So no, that's not valid. Hmm, so

---------------

 maybe my earlier logic is missing something.

Wait, no, in m=4, b=5.

Wait, for m=4, k

---------------

=3: n=9.

In base5, 9 is 1*5 +4=9. Sum is 1+4=5, which is not equal to sqrt(9)=3. So this

---------------

 is invalid.

Wait, so why did I think it was valid? Because d1= (9 -3)/4=6/4=1.5, which is not integer. Wait, but

---------------

 earlier I thought it was.

Wait, no, wait, for m=4, k=3:

d1=(9 -3)/4=6/4=1.5, which is not integer. So it

---------------

's invalid. So why did I think it was?

Ah, because I thought 4 divides 6, but 6/4 is not integer. So,

---------------

 my mistake earlier.

So, for m=4, k=3: 4 divides6? 6 mod4=2, so no. So invalid

---------------

.

k=4: 4*3=12, 12 mod4=0. So yes.

d1=(16-4)/4=12/4=3, which is ≤4. So valid.

So only k=4 is valid. So count=1.

Wait

---------------

, so m=4, count=1.

Similarly, m=5:

sqrt(6)=~2.449, ceil=3. So k=3,4,5.

Check each:

k=3:3*2=6. 5 divides6? No.

k=18:18*17=306. 18 divides306? Yes. d1=(324 -18)/18=306/18=17. Valid.

So, count=3 (k=9,10,18).

m=18, count=3.

Hmm, so up

---------------

 to m=18, the maximum count is 3. So, for each m, the count is mostly 1 or 3, but

---------------

 not higher yet.

Wait, maybe when m is highly composite, the number of divisors increases, leading to more k's.

So, let's try m=24.

m=24:

sqrt(25)=5, so k ranges from5 to24.

Check each k:

But this

---------------

 is time-consuming. Maybe I can find a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps for m=24, the number of k's is higher.

Alternatively

---------------

, maybe m=24 is a candidate. Let me try.

m=24:

Compute lower bound: sqrt(25)=5. So k=5 to24.

Now

---------------

, check which k satisfy 24 dividesk(k-1).

So, k(k-1) must be divisible by24.

Since

---------------

 24=8*3, and k and k-1 are consecutive, one of them is even, and one of them must be divisible by3.

But

---------------

 to have k(k-1) divisible by8, either k or k-1 must be divisible by8, or one divisible by4 and the other divisible by2.

So, let

---------------

's list the k's from5 to24 where k(k -1) is divisible by24.

Let me list

---------------

 the k's:

k=5:5*4=20. 24 divides20? No.

k=6:6*5=30. 24 divides30? No.

k=7:7*6=42. 24 divides42? No.

k=8:8*7=56. 24 divides56? No.

k=9:9*8=72. 24 divides72? Yes. So,

---------------

 d1=(81 -9)/24=72/24=3. Valid.

k=10:10*9=90. 24 divides90? No.

k=11:11*10=110. 24 divides110? No.

k=12:12*11=132. 24 divides132? 132/24=5.5. No.

k=13:13*12=156. 24 divides156? 156/24=6.5. No.

k=14:14*13=182. 24 divides182? No.

k=15:15*14=210. 24 divides210? 210/24=8.75. No.

k=16:16*15=240. 24 divides240? Yes. d1=(256 -16)/24=240/24=10. Valid.

k=17:17*16=272. 24 divides272? 272/24≈11.333. No.

k=18:18*17=306. 24 divides306? 306/24=12.75. No.

k=19:19*18=342. 24 divides342? 342/24=14.25. No.

k=20:20*19=380. 24 divides380? 380/24≈15.833. No.

k=21:21*20=420. 24 divides420? 420/24=17.5. No.

k=22:22*21=462. 24 divides462? 462/24=19.25. No.

k=23:23*22=506. 24 divides506? 506/24≈21.083. No.

k=24:24*23=552. 24 divides552? Yes. d1=(576 -24)/24=552/24=23. Valid.

So, for

---------------

 m=24, the valid k's are9,16,24. So count=3.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, maybe

---------------

 m=30.

m=30:

sqrt(31)=5.567, ceil=6. So k=6 to30.

Check each k where 30 dividesk(k-1).

Since

---------------

 30=2*3*5.

k(k -1) must be divisible by30.

Which requires that among

---------------

 k and k-1, one is divisible by2, one by3, and one by5.

But since k and k-1 are consecutive, one is even (divisible by2), one of them must be divisible by3, and one of them must be divisible by5.

So, let

---------------

's find k such that either k or k-1 is divisible by5, and either k or k-1 is divisible by3.

So, for

---------------

 k from6 to30:

k=6:6*5=30. 30 divides30? Yes. d1=(36 -6)/30=30/30=1. Valid.

k=7:7*6=42. 30 divides42? No.

k=8:8*7=56. 30 divides56? No.

k=9:9*8=72. 30 divides72? No.

k=10:10*9=90. 30 divides90? Yes. d1=(100 -10)/30=90/30=3. Valid.

k=11:11*10=110. 30 divides110? No.

k=12:12*11=132. 30 divides132? No.

k=13:13*12=156. 30 divides156? No.

k=14:14*13=182. 30 divides182? No.

k=15:15*14=210. 30 divides210? Yes. d1=(225 -15)/30=210/30=7. Valid.

k=16:16*15=240. 30 divides240? Yes. d1=(256 -16)/30=240/30=8. Valid.

k=17:17*16=272. 30 divides272? No.

k=18:18*17=306. 30 divides306? 306/30=10.2. No.

k=19:19*18=342. 30 divides342? 342/30=11.4. No.

k=20:20*19=380. 30 divides380? 380/30≈12.666. No.

k=21:21*20=420. 30 divides420? Yes. d1=(441 -21)/30=420/30=14. Valid.

k=22:22*21=462. 30 divides462? 462/30=15.4. No.

k=23:23*22=506. 30 divides506? 506/30≈16.866. No.

k=24:24*23=552. 30 divides552? 552/30=18.4. No.

k=25:25*24=600. 30 divides600? Yes. d1=(625 -25)/30=600/30=20. Valid.

k=26:26*25=650. 30 divides650? 650/30≈21.666. No.

k=27:27*26=702. 30 divides702? 702/30=23.4. No.

k=28:28*27=756. 30 divides756? 756/30=25.2. No.

k=29:29*28=812. 30 divides812? 812/30≈27.066. No.

k=30:30*29=870. 30 divides870? Yes. d1=(900 -30)/30=870/30=29. Valid.

So, for m=30, the valid k's are6,10,15,16,21,25,30. That's 7 numbers. So count=7.

That

---------------

's more than previous counts. So, m=30, count=7.

Wait, 7 is more than 3 but still less than 10. So, need

---------------

 to go higher.

m=60:

sqrt(61)=7.81, ceil=8. So k=8 to60.

But

---------------

 m=60 is quite large. Let's see.

Wait, but perhaps m=60, which is 60, but

---------------

 it's time-consuming to compute manually. Maybe I can find a pattern.

Wait, perhaps the number of solutions for m is equal to the number of divisors of m,

---------------

 but only considering certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps m must be such that m has many small factors, allowing for more k's to satisfy m dividesk(k-1).

Wait, maybe

---------------

 m=60 has more solutions.

But let's think: m=60.

Compute lower bound k: sqrt(61)=7.81, ceil=8. So k=8 to60.

For

---------------

 k in this range, check if 60 dividesk(k-1).

So, 60=4*3*5.

So

---------------

, for k(k-1) to be divisible by60, it must be divisible by4,3,5.

Since k and k-1 are consecutive, one is even, and

---------------

 one is odd.

To be divisible by4, either k or k-1 must be divisible by4.

To be divisible by3, either k or k-1 must be divisible by3.

To be divisible by5, either k or k-1 must be divisible by5.

So, for

---------------

 k from8 to60, let's find the k's where:

Either k or k-1 is divisible by4,

Either k or k-1 is divisible by3,

Either k or k-1 is divisible by5.

So

---------------

, the valid k's are those where k ≡0 or1 mod4, k≡0 or1 mod3, and k≡0 or1 mod5.

So

---------------

, using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the solutions are the numbers where k ≡ a mod lcm(4,3,5)=60, for a=0 or1 in each modulus.

But since

---------------

 we are dealing with k up to60, let's list them:

Possible combinations:

For mod4: 0 or1

mod3: 0 or1

mod5:0 or1

So, each

---------------

 combination is 2*2*2=8 possibilities.

But since we are looking for k in [8,60], we

---------------

 can compute the solutions for each combination.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe an alternative approach.

Alternatively, for m=60, the number of k's is equal to the number of integers

---------------

 in [8,60] such that k ≡0 or1 mod4, k≡0 or1 mod3, and k≡0 or1 mod5.

But

---------------

 perhaps it's easier to note that the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of m, but only for

---------------

 specific cases.

Wait, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to choose for each prime factor whether it divides k or k-1.

Since m is 60=2^2*3*5.

For

---------------

 each prime power, we can assign it to divide either k or k-1.

But since 2^2 is a prime power, and 3 and5 are primes.

So, for 2^2: it

---------------

 can divide k or k-1.

Similarly, 3 can divide k or k-1.

Similarly,5 can divide k or k-1.

So

---------------

, the total number of possibilities is 2^3=8.

Each possibility corresponds to a unique solution modulo m=60.

But

---------------

 since k must be in [8,60], each solution modulo60 will correspond to one k in that range.

So

---------------

, for m=60, the number of solutions is8.

But wait, let me check.

But not all combinations

---------------

 may result in a k in [8,60]. For example, the solution k=1 mod4, 1 mod3, 1 mod5 is k=1, which is below8.

Similarly, other solutions may be above

---------------

60, but since we're looking up to60, perhaps each of the 8 solutions falls within [8,60].

But let's compute.



---------------

The solutions are the numbers k such that:

k ≡ a mod4,

k ≡ b mod3,

k ≡ c mod5,

where a ∈

---------------

{0,1}, b ∈{0,1}, c ∈{0,1}.

So, 8 possibilities.

We

---------------

 can compute each:

1. a=0, b=0, c=0: k ≡0 mod4, 0 mod3, 0 mod5. So, k ≡0 mod60. So

---------------

, k=60. Which is within [8,60]. Valid.

2. a=0, b=0, c=1: k≡0 mod4, 0 mod3, 1 mod5.

Solve:

Find k ≡0 mod12 (since lcm(4,3)=12),

and k≡1 mod5.

Find k ≡0 mod12 and

---------------

 k≡1 mod5.

Let k=12m.

12m ≡1 mod5 ⇒12m ≡1 ⇒2m≡1 mod5 ⇒m≡3 mod5.

So, m=5n +3.

Thus, k=12*(5n +3)=60n +36.

Within [8,60], n=0: k=36.

n=1:60+36=96>60. So, only k=36.

3. a=0, b=1, c=0: k≡0 mod4, 1 mod3, 0 mod5.

Find k ≡0 mod4, 1 mod3, 0 mod5.

So

---------------

, k must be divisible by5 and4, so divisible by20.

So, k=20m.

20m ≡1 mod3 ⇒20m ≡1 ⇒2m≡1 mod3 ⇒m≡2 mod3.

So, m=3n +2.

Thus, k=20*(3n +2)=60n +40.

Within [8,60], n=0:40.

n=1:100>60. So, k=40.

4. a=0, b=1, c=1: k≡0 mod4, 1 mod3, 1 mod5.

Find k≡0 mod4,

k≡1 mod3,

k≡1 mod5.

So

---------------

, solve:

k ≡1 mod3 and k≡1 mod5 ⇒k≡1 mod15.

So, k=15m +1.

Also, k≡0 mod4.

So, 15m +1 ≡0 mod4 ⇒15m ≡-1 mod4 ⇒15m ≡3 mod4 ⇒15≡3 mod4 ⇒3m≡3 mod4 ⇒m≡1 mod4.

So, m=4n +1.

Thus, k=15*(4n +1)+1=60n +16.

Within [8,60], n=0:16.

n=1:76>60. So, k=16.

5. a=1, b=0, c=0: k≡1 mod4, 0 mod3, 0 mod5.

Find k≡1 mod4,

k≡0 mod3,

k≡0 mod5.

So, k must be divisible by15.

Let

---------------

 k=15m.

15m ≡1 mod4 ⇒15m ≡1 ⇒3m≡1 mod4 ⇒m≡3 mod4.

So, m=4n +3.

Thus, k=15*(4n +3)=60n +45.

Within [8,60], n=0:45.

n=1:105>60. So, k=45.

6. a=1, b=0, c=1: k≡1 mod4, 0 mod3, 1 mod5.

Find k≡1 mod4,

k≡0 mod3,

k≡1 mod5.

So, solve:

k≡0 mod3,

k≡1 mod4,

k≡1 mod5.

First

---------------

, find k ≡1 mod4 and k≡1 mod5.

Which is k≡1 mod20.

So, k=20m +1.

Now, 20m +1 ≡0 mod3 ⇒20m +1 ≡2m +1 ≡0 mod3 ⇒2m ≡-1 mod3 ⇒2m ≡2 mod3 ⇒m≡1 mod3.

So, m=3n +1.

Thus, k=20*(3n +1) +1=60n +21.

Within [8,60], n=0:21.

n=1:81>60. So, k=21.

7. a=1, b=1, c=0: k≡1 mod4, 1 mod3, 0 mod5.

Find k≡1 mod4,

k≡1 mod3,

k≡0 mod5.

So, k must be divisible by5.

Let k=5m.

Also, k≡1 mod4 and k≡1 mod3.

So, 5m ≡1 mod4 ⇒5m≡1 ⇒m≡1 mod4.

And 5m ≡1 mod3 ⇒5m≡1 ⇒2m≡1 mod3 ⇒m≡2 mod3.

So, m ≡1 mod4 and m≡2 mod3.

Find m using

---------------

 Chinese Remainder:

Find m ≡x mod12.

m ≡1 mod4,

m ≡2 mod3.

Possible

---------------

 m: Let's list m mod12.

m=2: 2≡2 mod3, 2≡2 mod4≠1.

m=5:5≡2 mod3, 5≡1 mod4. Yes.

So, m≡5 mod12.

Thus, m=12n +5.

Thus, k=5*(12n +5)=60n +25.

Within [8,60], n=0:25.

n=1:85>60. So, k=25.

8. a=1, b=1, c=1: k≡1 mod4,1 mod3,1 mod5.

Find k≡1 mod4,

k≡1 mod3,

k≡1 mod5.

Thus, k ≡1 mod lcm(4,3,5)=60.

So, k=60n +1.

Within [8,60], n=0:1 (

---------------

too low).

n=1:61>60. So, no solution in [8,60].

So, the

---------------

 solutions are:

k=60,36,40,16,45,21,25.

That's7 solutions.

But wait, earlier

---------------

 when I thought m=60, I thought there would be8 solutions, but one falls below8, so only7.

But let

---------------

's verify:

k=16: n=256. In base61, 256 is represented as d

---------------

1*d2.

Wait, base61: 256 divided by61 is4, remainder12. So, digits are4 and12. But 

---------------

12 is a valid digit in base61. Sum is4+12=16. sqrt(256)=16. So valid.

Similarly, k=21: n=441.

In base61:441 /61=7, remainder14. So digits7 and14. Sum7+14=21. sqrt(441)=21. Valid.

k=25: n=625.

625 /61=10, remainder15. So digits10 and15. Sum25. Valid.

k=36: n=1296.

1296 /61=21, remainder15. So digits21 and15. Sum36. Valid.

k=40: n=1600.

1600 /61=26, remainder14. Digits26 and14. Sum40. Valid.

k=45: n=2025.

2025 /61=33, remainder12. Digits33 and12. Sum45. Valid.

k=60: n=3600.

3600 /61=59, remainder1. Digits59 and1. Sum60. sqrt(3600)=60. Valid.

So, that

---------------

's7 solutions. So count=7.

Wait, but earlier I thought the number of solutions would be8, but one falls

---------------

 below8, so only7.

So, for m=60, count=7.

Hmm, still less than10.

Wait, perhaps m=120.

But this

---------------

 is getting too big. Alternatively, maybe m=240.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to find m where the number of solutions

---------------

 is higher.

Wait, perhaps m=120.

m=120:

sqrt(121)=11, so k=11 to120.

Number

---------------

 of solutions is equal to the number of k in [11,120] such that 120 dividesk(k -1).

1

---------------

20=8*3*5.

So, similar to m=60, but with an additional factor of2.

Wait, 

---------------

120=8*3*5.

So, k(k -1) must be divisible by8,3,5.

Thus

---------------

, similar to before, but with higher powers.

So, for k in11 to120, find k where:

Either k or k-1 is divisible by8,

Either k or k-1 is divisible by3,

Either k or k-1 is divisible by5.

So, the

---------------

 number of solutions is again 2^3=8 possibilities, but within the range.

But since m=120, the

---------------

 solutions would be:

Each combination of assignments of the prime powers to k or k-1.

Thus, for each of the 8 possibilities, there would

---------------

 be one solution modulo120.

So, let's compute the solutions.

Each solution is k ≡ a mod8, k≡b mod3, k≡c mod5, where a ∈{0,1}, b∈{0,1}, c∈{0,1}.

But

---------------

 since m=120, the solutions will be in the range [1,120]. So, for each combination, there

---------------

 will be exactly one solution in that range.

So, 8 solutions.

But let's check if any fall below11.

The smallest solution is k=1, which is below11. The next is

---------------

 k=1 +120=121, which is above120.

Wait, no, each combination will

---------------

 have exactly one solution in [1,120]. So, the solutions are:

1. a=0,b=0,c=0: k=0 mod8,0 mod3,0 mod5 ⇒k=0 mod120 ⇒k=120.

2. a=0,b=0,c=1: k=0 mod8,0 mod3,1 mod5.

Find k ≡0 mod24 (lcm(8,3)=24),

k≡1 mod5.

So

---------------

, 24m ≡1 mod5 ⇒24m≡4m≡1 mod5 ⇒4m≡1 ⇒m≡4^{-1}=4 mod5.

So, m=5n +4.

Thus, k=24*(5n +4)=120n +96.

Within [11,120], n=0:96.

3. a=0,b=1,c=0: k=0 mod8,1 mod3,0 mod5.

Find k ≡0 mod8,

k≡1 mod3,

k≡0 mod5.

k must be divisible by5 and8, so divisible by40.

k=40m.

40m ≡1 mod3 ⇒40m≡1 ⇒m≡1 mod3.

So, m=3n +1.

Thus, k=40*(3n +1)=120n +40.

Within [11,120], n=0:40.

n=1:160>120.

4. a=0,b=1,c=1: k=0 mod8,1 mod3,1 mod5.

Find k≡0 mod8,

k≡1 mod3,

k≡1 mod5.

So

---------------

, solve:

k≡1 mod3 and1 mod5 ⇒k≡1 mod15.

So, k=15m +1.

Also, k≡0 mod8 ⇒15m +1 ≡0 mod8 ⇒15m ≡-1 mod8 ⇒15m≡7 mod8 ⇒15≡7 mod8 ⇒7m≡7 mod8 ⇒m≡1 mod8.

Thus, m=8n +1.

So, k=15*(8n +1)+1=120n +16.

Within [11,120], n=0:16.

n=1:136>120.

5. a=1,b=0,c=0: k=1 mod8,0 mod3,0 mod5.

Find k≡1 mod8,

k≡0 mod3,

k≡0 mod5.

k must be divisible by15.

k=15m.

15m ≡1 mod8 ⇒15m≡1 ⇒7m≡1 mod8 ⇒m≡7 mod8.

So, m=8n +7.

Thus, k=15*(8n +7)=120n +105.

Within [11,120], n=0:105.

n=1:225>120.

6. a=1,b=0,c=1: k=1 mod8,0 mod3,1 mod5.

Find k≡1 mod8,

k≡0 mod3,

k≡1 mod5.

Solve:

k≡0 mod3,

k≡1 mod5,

k≡1 mod8.

First, solve k≡1 mod5 and k≡1 mod8.

Which

---------------

 is k≡1 mod40.

So, k=40m +1.

Now, 40m +1 ≡0 mod3 ⇒40m +1 ≡1m +1 ≡0 mod3 ⇒m≡-1≡2 mod3.

So, m=3n +2.

Thus, k=40*(3n +2)+1=120n +81.

Within [11,120], n=0:81.

n=1:201>120.

7. a=1,b=1,c=0: k=1 mod8,1 mod3,0 mod5.

Find k≡1 mod8,

k≡1 mod3,

k≡0 mod5.

So, k must be divisible by5.

k=5m.

Also, k≡1 mod8 and1 mod3.

So, 5m ≡1 mod8 ⇒5m≡1 ⇒m≡5^{-1}=5 mod8.

And 5m ≡1 mod3 ⇒5m≡1 ⇒2m≡1 ⇒m≡2 mod3.

So, m≡5 mod8 and m≡2 mod3.

Find m:

m

---------------

 ≡5 mod8,

m ≡2 mod3.

Let m=8n +5.

8n +5 ≡2 mod3 ⇒8n ≡-3 ≡0 mod3 ⇒8n ≡0 ⇒2n ≡0 ⇒n≡0 mod3.

Thus, n=3k.

So, m=8*(3k) +5=24k +5.

Thus, k=5*(24k +5)=120k +25.

Within [11,120], k=0:25.

k=1:145>120.

8. a=1,b=1,c=1: k=1 mod8,1 mod3,1 mod5.

Find k≡1 mod8,

k≡1 mod3,

k≡1 mod5.

So, k≡1 mod lcm(8,3,5)=120.

Thus, k=120n +1.

Within [11,120], n=0:1 (too low).

n=1:121>120. So, no solution.

Thus, the solutions are:

k=120,96,40,16,105,81,25.

That's7 solutions. Wait

---------------

, same as m=60.

Hmm, but wait, m=120, count=7. So, same as m=60.

Wait

---------------

, but maybe I made a mistake here. Because m=120 is double m=60, but the number of solutions didn't double.

Alternatively, perhaps the

---------------

 number of solutions is not directly dependent on m but on the number of prime factors.

Wait, perhaps the number of solutions is 2^{number of distinct prime factors}.

But m=60 has 3 distinct prime factors, so 2^3=8, but we

---------------

 have7 solutions because one is below the lower bound.

Similarly, m=120 has the same number of distinct prime factors, so same number of solutions.

Wait

---------------

, perhaps for m=240, which has more prime factors?

Wait, m=240=16*3*5. So, same

---------------

 number of distinct prime factors (2,3,5), but higher exponents.

So, perhaps the number of solutions would still be8

---------------

, but one is below the lower bound, so7.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps m=30 has3 prime factors, and

---------------

 m=30 has7 solutions? Wait, no, earlier for m=30, count was7.

Wait, maybe

---------------

 the number of solutions isn't directly tied to the number of prime factors, but to the number of ways to assign the prime factors to k or k-1.

But

---------------

 for m=30, it's 7 solutions, which is less than 2^3=8.

Wait, perhaps for

---------------

 m=30, one solution is below the lower bound, so we have7.

Similarly, for m=60 and m=120, one

---------------

 solution is below the lower bound, so7.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the least b where there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. So, I

---------------

 need to find m where the count exceeds10.

So, perhaps I need to find m where the number of solutions is more

---------------

 than10.

Wait, maybe m=840, which is the least common multiple of1-8, but that's too

---------------

 big.

Alternatively, perhaps m=240.

Wait, but earlier, m=240 had7 solutions.

Wait, perhaps I

---------------

 need to find m with more prime factors, allowing more combinations.

Wait, m=210=2*3*5*7. So, four distinct prime factors.

Thus, the number of solutions would be2^4=16, but one

---------------

 may be below the lower bound.

So, for m=210:

Compute the lower bound for k: sqrt(211)=14.525, ceil=15.

So, k ranges from15 to210.

Number of solutions is16 (all

---------------

 combinations of 4 prime factors assigned to k or k-1), but one may be below15.

Let me compute:

Each combination of

---------------

 a=0 or1 mod2, b=0 or1 mod3, c=0 or1 mod5, d=0 or1 mod7.

But

---------------

 this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is16, but some are below15.

But

---------------

 it's time-consuming to compute manually.

Alternatively, perhaps for m=210, the count is15, which is more than10.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look

---------------

 for m where m is a factorial, as they have many factors.

Wait, m=720=6!.

But this

---------------

 is getting too big, and perhaps not necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps m=1260=2^2*3^2*5*7.

But again, this

---------------

 is too time-consuming.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of m, but only considering

---------------

 the coprime pairs.

Wait, perhaps for m=240, which has32 divisors, but many

---------------

 of them are not coprime.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions increases when m is a multiple of many small primes, allowing more combinations.

So, perhaps m=210=

---------------

2*3*5*7.

So, for m=210, the number of solutions would be2^4=16.

But since

---------------

 the lower bound is sqrt(211)=14.5, so k starts at15.

So, 

---------------

16 solutions, but one is k=1, which is below15, so15 solutions.

Thus, for m=210, count=15.

Which is more than10.

So, then b=m +1=211.

But wait, is

---------------

 this the minimal m?

Wait, let's check for smaller m.

Wait, m=120 had7 solutions.

What about m=180=2^2*3^2*5.

Number of solutions would

---------------

 be2^3=8, but one is below the lower bound.

So, count=7.

Similarly, m=240, count=7.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 m=360.

m=360=2^3*3^2*5.

Number of solutions=2^3=8, count=7.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe m=420=2^2*3*5*7.

Number of solutions=2^4=16, count=15.

So, b

---------------

=421.

But perhaps m=210 is the first with15 solutions.

But is there a smaller m with more than10 solutions?

Wait, let's think of

---------------

 m=60, which had7 solutions.

What about m=120, same as60.

Wait, perhaps m=8

---------------

40=2^3*3*5*7.

Number of solutions=2^4=16, count=15.

So, perhaps the minimal m is210.

But I

---------------

 need to confirm.

Alternatively, perhaps m=60 has7, m=120 has7, m=180 has7, m=240 has7, m=360 has7, m=420 has15.

Thus, the minimal m where count>10 is m=210, giving

---------------

 b=211.

But wait, m=210 is 2*3*5*7, which

---------------

 is the product of first four primes.

So, the number of solutions is2^4=16, but one is below the lower bound, so15.

Thus, for

---------------

 m=210, count=15>10.

So, the minimal b is211.

But wait

---------------

, is there a smaller m with count>10?

Wait, m=1260 is larger, but perhaps m=3

---------------

00.

Wait, m=300=2^2*3*5^2.

Number of solutions=2^3=8, count=7.

No.

Wait

---------------

, m=420=2^2*3*5*7.

Number of solutions=2^4=16, count=15.

So, yes

---------------

, m=420 is smaller than m=1260.

Wait, but is there a smaller m than420 with count>10?

Wait, m=210 is smaller than420, but m

---------------

=210 is 210, which is smaller than420.

Wait, but m=210 is

---------------

 210, which is smaller than420.

So, m=210, count=15.

Thus

---------------

, b=211.

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure if m=210 is the minimal m with count>10.

Wait

---------------

, perhaps m=840=2^3*3*5*7.

Which is larger than210, but the

---------------

 count would be16.

But I'm looking for the minimal b, so m=210 is better.

Wait, but I

---------------

'm not sure if m=210 is indeed the minimal.

Alternatively, perhaps m=240.

Wait, m=240=

---------------

2^4*3*5.

Number of solutions=2^3=8, count=7.

No.

Alternatively, m=1260=2^2*3^2*5*7.

Number of solutions=2^4=16, count=15.

So, same

---------------

 as m=210 and m=420.

But m=210 is smaller.

Thus, the minimal b would be211.

Wait, but wait

---------------

, let's think again.

Earlier, for m=30, count=7.

For m=60, count=7.

For m=120, count=7.

For m=180, count=7.

For m=240, count=7.

For m=360, count=7.

For m=420, count=15.

For

---------------

 m=210, count=15.

So, m=210 is the first m where count=15>10.

Thus, b=211.

Wait, but is

---------------

 there a smaller m with count>10?

Wait, perhaps m=840=2^3*3*5*7.

But m=840 is larger than210.

So, m

---------------

=210 is the minimal m with count>10.

Thus, the least integer b is211.

Wait, but earlier

---------------

 I thought m=210, count=15.

But wait, for m=210, the lower bound is sqrt(211)=14.525, so k starts at15.

Thus

---------------

, in the range15 to210, all solutions except k=1 are valid.

So, number of solutions=16-1=15.

Thus, count=15>10.

So, the minimal b is211.

But wait, earlier

---------------

 for m=30, count=7.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, for m=30, the

---------------

 count was7, but for m=210, it's15.

So, the minimal m where count>10 is m=210, b

---------------

=211.

Thus, the answer is211.


The least integer \( b \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful integers is \( \boxed{211} \).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
