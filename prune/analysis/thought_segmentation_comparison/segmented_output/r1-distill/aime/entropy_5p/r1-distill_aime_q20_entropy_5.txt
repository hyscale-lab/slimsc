Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Let me try to unpack what this

---------------

 means.

First, the problem defines a b-eautiful number as a positive integer n that has exactly two digits when written in base b. Also

---------------

, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. 

Let me restate that to make sure I understand. If n is a two-digit number in base b, that means it can be expressed as n = a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero, and both a and c must be less than b. The

---------------

 sum of the digits, a + c, should equal sqrt(n). 

So, for n to be b-eautiful, the

---------------

 equation a + c = sqrt(a*b + c) must hold. Let me write that down:

a + c = sqrt(a*b + c)

If

---------------

 I square both sides to eliminate the square root, I get:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Expanding the left side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a*b + c

Hmm, let

---------------

's rearrange this equation to group like terms:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0

Maybe

---------------

 I can factor this or find a way to express it in terms of a or c. Let me try to rearrange it:

a^2 + (2c - b)a + (c^2 - c) = 0

This

---------------

 is a quadratic equation in terms of a. Let me denote this as:

A*a^2 + B*a + C = 0

Where:
A = 1
B = 2c - b
C = c^2 - c

So

---------------

 for each c (digit in base b, so c < b), I can solve for a using the quadratic formula. 



---------------

The quadratic formula says that a = [-B ± sqrt(B^2 - 4AC)] / (2A)

Plugging in A, B, C:

a = [-(2c - b) ± sqrt((2c - b)^2 - 4*1*(c^2 - c))]/2

Let me compute the discriminant:

D = (2c - b)^2 - 4(c^2 - c)

Expanding (2c - b)^2:

= 4c^2 - 4bc + b^2 - 4c^2 + 4c

Simplify:

= (4c^2 - 4c^2) + (-4bc) + (b^2) + 4c

= -4bc + b^2 + 4c

Factor terms

---------------

:

= b^2 -4bc +4c

Hmm, maybe factor out a c from the last two terms?

Wait, let

---------------

's see:

= b^2 + (-4bc +4c)

= b^2 + c*(-4b +4)

=

---------------

 b^2 +4c(1 - b)

Wait, not sure if that helps. Let me compute D as is:

D = b^2 -4bc +4c

So

---------------

, D = b^2 -4c(b -1)

Hmm, for the quadratic equation to have integer solutions, the discriminant must be a perfect square. Because a must be an integer (digit

---------------

 in base b, so a is integer between 1 and b-1).

So, D must be a perfect square.

So, for

---------------

 each base b and each c (from 0 to b-1), we can compute D and check if it's a perfect square. If it is, then we

---------------

 can compute a and check if a is a positive integer less than b.

Wait, but c is a digit in base b, so c must be in 0 to b-1. Similarly

---------------

, a must be in 1 to b-1 because it's the leading digit.

So, for each base b, I can iterate c from 0 to b-1, compute D, check if D is a perfect square. Then compute

---------------

 a, check if a is integer and in 1 to b-1. If so, then n = a*b + c is a b-eautiful number.

But

---------------

 since I need to find the smallest b where there are more than ten such numbers, perhaps I should find, for each b starting from 2 upwards, the number of b

---------------

-eautiful integers, and stop when I find the first b with more than ten.

But this could be time-consuming. Maybe I can find a pattern

---------------

 or a formula.

Let me see:

From the equation:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Let me denote

---------------

 s = a + c. Then s^2 = a*b + c.

But since a = s - c, substitute into the equation:

s^2 = (s - c)*b + c

=

---------------

 s*b - c*b + c

= s*b - c(b - 1)

So, s^2 = s*b - c(b -1)

Rearranged:

s^2 - s*b = -c(b -1)

Multiply both sides by -1:

s*b - s^2 = c(b -1)

So,

c = (s*b - s^2)/(b -1)

Hmm

---------------

, that's interesting. So c can be expressed in terms of s and b.

Since c must be an integer between 0 and b-1, inclusive

---------------

, and s is a + c, which is sqrt(n). Since n is a two-digit number in base b, the maximum value of n is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b^2 -1, so sqrt(n) is less than sqrt(b^2 -1) which is less than b. So

---------------

 s must be less than b.

Also, since a is at least 1 and c is at least 0, s = a + c is at least 1. So s ranges from 1 to b-1.

So, for each s from 1 to b-1, compute

---------------

 c = (s*b - s^2)/(b -1). If c is integer and 0 <= c < b, then a

---------------

 = s - c, which must satisfy 1 <= a < b.

So, for each b, we can iterate s from 1 to b-1, compute c, and check if c is integer and within range. If so, count that as a valid b-eautiful number.

This

---------------

 approach might be more efficient because it reduces the problem to iterating s for each b.

So, let's write down the formula for c again:

c = (s*b - s^2)/(b -1)

S

---------------

implify numerator:

s*(b - s)

So,

c = s*(b - s)/(b -1)

We need c to be an integer,

---------------

 so (b -1) must divide s*(b - s).

So, for each s in 1 to b-1, check if (b -1) divides s*(b - s).

If

---------------

 yes, then compute c, and check if c is between 0 and b-1.

Then, a = s - c must be between 1 and b-1.

So

---------------

, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of s in 1 to b-1 for which (b -1) divides s*(b - s), and c is within

---------------

 the digit constraints.

Hmm, so perhaps the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of divisors s of

---------------

 (b-1) or something like that.

Wait, because (b -1) divides s*(b - s). So s*(b - s) must be a multiple of (b -1).

Let

---------------

 me denote d = b -1. So d = b -1.

Then, s*(d +1 - s) must be divisible by d.

Because b = d +1, so s

---------------

*(b - s) = s*(d +1 - s) = s*(d +1 - s) = s*(d +1) - s^2.

Wait, maybe

---------------

 another approach.

Since d divides s*(d +1 - s), which is s*(d +1 - s).

So

---------------

, d | s*(d +1 - s).

But d and (d +1) are coprime, because consecutive integers.

Wait, so

---------------

 d and d+1 are coprime, so d divides s*(d +1 - s).

But since d and d+1 are coprime, d must divide s*(d+1 -s).

But

---------------

 d and s can share factors. Hmm.

Alternatively, since d = b -1, and s is from 1 to d.

So

---------------

, for each s in 1 to d, check if d divides s*(d +1 - s).

But s*(d +1 - s) = s*(d +1) - s^2.

Hmm

---------------

, not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps express it as:

s*(d +1 - s) = s*(d +1) - s^2 = s*d + s - s^2.

So

---------------

, s*(d +1 - s) = d*s + s - s^2.

Hmm.

Wait, since d divides this, d

---------------

 | (d*s + s - s^2).

But d divides d*s, so d must divide (s - s^2).

So, d divides s*(1 - s).

But

---------------

 s is from 1 to d, so s*(1 - s) is negative or zero when s=1, 

---------------

0 when s=1, negative for s>1.

Wait, s*(1 - s) = s - s^2.

Hmm, so

---------------

 d must divide s - s^2.

Which is equivalent to d divides s(1 - s).

So, s(1 - s) must be divisible by d.

But s is

---------------

 between 1 and d.

So, s can be 1, 2, ..., d.

Let me try small values of d to see if

---------------

 I can find a pattern.

For example, take d=2 (so b=3):

s can be 1 or 2.

For s=1: 1*(1 -1)=0. 0 is divisible by d=2. So c = 1*(3 -1)/(3-1) = 1*2/2 = 1. So

---------------

 c=1, which is less than 3. Then a = s - c = 1 -1=0, which is invalid because a must be at least 1. So this

---------------

 s=1 is invalid.

For s=2: 2*(1 -2)=2*(-1)=-2. -

---------------

2 is divisible by 2. So c=2*(3 -2)/(3-1)=2*1/2=1. So c=1. Then a=2-1=1, which is valid. So n = 1*3 +1=4. Check sqrt(4)=2, and digits sum 1+1=2. Correct. So for

---------------

 b=3, there is 1 b-eautiful number.

Similarly, let's try d=3 (b=4):

s ranges

---------------

 1,2,3.

s=1: 1*(1-1)=0. So c=1*(4 -1)/(4-1)=1*3/3=1. a=1-1=0 invalid.

s=2: 2*(1-2)= -2. 

---------------

3 does not divide -2? 3 doesn't divide 2, so no.

s=3: 3*(1-3)=3*(-2)=-6. 3 divides -6. So c=3*(4 -3)/(4-1)=3*1/3=1. Then a=3-1=2. Which is valid. So n=2*4 +1=9. sqrt(9)=3, digits sum 2+1=3. Correct. So for b=4, one

---------------

 b-eautiful number.

Hmm, seems like for each base, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of s where d divides s(1 -s), which is

---------------

 equivalent to d divides s(s -1). Wait, because s(1 - s) = -s(s -1). So d divides s(s -1).

So

---------------

, d divides s(s -1). Since d is fixed, for each s from 1 to d, check if d divides s(s -1).

But

---------------

 since s and s-1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. So d must divide either s or s-1.

Because

---------------

 if d divides s(s-1), and gcd(s, s-1)=1, then d must divide s or d must divide s-1.

So, for each s in 1 to d, either

---------------

 d divides s or d divides s-1.

But s ranges from 1 to d, so s-1 ranges from 0 to d-1.

So, when

---------------

 does d divide s or s-1?

Case 1: d divides s. Since s <= d, the only possibility is s = d. Because d divides d.

Case 2: d divides s-1. So s -1 must be a multiple of d. But s-1 <=

---------------

 d-1, so the only possibility is s -1 =0, i.e., s=1.

So, for s in 1 to d, only s=1 and s=d will satisfy that d divides s(s-1).

Wait

---------------

, that's interesting. So for each d, the only s that satisfy d | s(s-1) are s=1 and s=d.

But

---------------

 wait, let's test this with d=2:

d=2. s=1: 1*(1-1)=0, which is divisible by 2? Wait, 0 is divisible by any d, so yes. s=2: 2*(2-1)=2, which is divisible by 2. So yes

---------------

, both s=1 and s=2.

But earlier when d=2 (b=3), s=1 gave

---------------

 c=1, a=0 (invalid). s=2 gave c=1, a=1 (valid). So only s=2 was

---------------

 valid. So only one solution.

Similarly, d=3:

s=1: 1*0=0, which is divisible by 3. But

---------------

 a=0 invalid.

s=3: 3*2=6, which is divisible by 3. So c

---------------

=1, a=2. Valid.

So again, only one solution.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about d=4, let's see:

d=4, b=5.

s=1: c=1*(5 -1)/(5-1)=1*4/4=1. a=1-1=0 invalid.

s=4: c=4*(5 -4)/(5-1)=4*1/4=1. a=4-1=3. Valid. So n=3*5 +1=16. sqrt(16)=4, digits sum 3+1=4. Correct.

So again

---------------

, only one solution.

Wait, but when d=6, b=7.

s=1: c=1*(7-1)/(7-1)=6/6=1. a=0 invalid.

s=6: c=6*(7-6)/(7-1)=6*1/6=1. a=6-1=5. So n=5*7 +1=36. sqrt(36)=6, digits sum 5+1=6. Correct.

Only

---------------

 one solution.

Wait, but wait, this contradicts my initial thought. Because if for each d, only s=1 and s=d give

---------------

 c as integer, but s=1 gives a=0 which is invalid, except when s=d.

Wait, but let

---------------

's try d=1, which would be b=2.

s=1: c=1*(2 -1)/(2-1)=1*1/1=1. a=1-1=0 invalid. So no solution for b=2.

But wait

---------------

, in the problem statement, b >=2, but the example is 81 is 13-beautiful. So for

---------------

 bases like b=13, let's check.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe my earlier conclusion that only s=1 and s=d give

---------------

 c as integer is incorrect.

Wait, let me take d=4, b=5.

s=2:

c = 2*(5 -2)/(5 -1) = 2*3/4 = 6/4 = 1.5, which is not integer. So invalid.

s=3:

c=3*(5 -3)/(5-1)=3*2/4=6/4=1.5, not integer.

So,

---------------

 only s=1 and s=4 give c integer, but s=1 gives a=0 invalid. So only one solution.

Similarly

---------------

, let's take d=5, b=6.

s=1: c=1*(6-1)/(6-1)=5/5=1. a=0 invalid.

s=2: c=2*(6-2)/(6-1)=2*4/5=8/5=1.6, not integer.

s=3: c=3*(6-3)/5=3*3/5=9/5=1.8, not integer.

s=4: c=4*(6-4)/5=4*2/5=8/5=1.6, no.

s=5: c=5*(6-5)/5=5*1/5=1. a=5-1=4. So n=4*6 +1=25. sqrt(25)=5. 

---------------

4+1=5. Correct. So only one solution.

Wait, but earlier I thought maybe for some d, there are more s that satisfy the condition. But

---------------

 according to this, only s=1 and s=d yield integer c, but s=1 gives a=0 which is invalid, so only s=d gives a valid solution.

But wait

---------------

, in the problem statement, the example is 81 is 13-beautiful. Let's compute for b=13.

s

---------------

 = a + c = sqrt(81) =9.

So s=9.

c = s*(b - s)/(b -1) = 9*(13 -9)/(13 -1) =9*4/12= 36/12=3.

So c=3. Then a = s - c =9 -3=6. So n=6*13 +3=81.

So

---------------

 that's correct.

But according to my earlier conclusion, for b=13, d=12.

So s can

---------------

 be 1 and 12.

s=1: c=1*(13-1)/12=12/12=1. a=0 invalid.

s=12: c=12*(13-12)/12=12*1/12=1. a=12-1=11. n=11*13 +1=143 +1=144. sqrt(144)=12. 11+1=12. Correct.

So for

---------------

 b=13, two solutions: n=81 and n=144? Wait, but according to my earlier computation

---------------

, only s=12 would give a valid solution.

Wait, but according to the example, 81 is a solution with

---------------

 s=9. So how come s=9 is also a solution?

Wait, maybe my earlier conclusion was wrong. Because

---------------

 in the case of b=13, d=12.

s=9:

c=9*(13 -9)/(13 -1)=9*4/12=3. So c=3, which is an

---------------

 integer. So s=9 is a solution.

But according to my previous logic, only s=1 and s=12 would yield

---------------

 c as integer.

But in this case, s=9 also gives c integer. So my previous conclusion was incorrect.

So

---------------

, perhaps my initial assumption that only s=1 and s=d would give c integer was wrong.

So, I need to find

---------------

 all s in 1 to d such that (s*(d +1 -s)) is divisible by d.

Wait, but

---------------

 s*(d +1 -s) must be divisible by d.

So, for each s, compute s*(d +1 -s) and check if it's divisible by d.

Alternatively

---------------

, since d divides s*(d +1 -s), and d and d+1 are coprime, perhaps I

---------------

 can find s such that s*(d +1 -s) ≡ 0 mod d.

But s*(d +1 -s) mod d.



---------------

Since d+1 ≡1 mod d, so (d +1 -s) ≡ (1 -s) mod d.

So, s*(d +1 -s) ≡ s*(1 - s) mod d.

So, we

---------------

 have s*(1 -s) ≡ 0 mod d.

Which is equivalent to s(s -1) ≡ 0 mod d.

So, d

---------------

 divides s(s -1).

So, for each s in 1 to d, if d divides s(s -1), then c is integer.

But

---------------

 since s and s-1 are consecutive integers, their gcd is 1. So, d must divide either s or s-1.

But

---------------

 since s is from 1 to d, s can only be a multiple of d if s=d. Similarly, s-1 can be a multiple of d only if s-1=0, i.e., s=1.

Wait, but in the case of d=12, s=9:

s=9, s-1=8.

d=12.

---------------

 12 divides 9*8=72. 72/12=6. So yes, 12 divides 72.

But 12 does not divide 9 or 8 individually. 12 doesn't divide 9, and

---------------

 12 doesn't divide 8. So, how come 12 divides 9*8?

Because 9 and 8 are coprime, but their product is divisible by 12.

Hmm, so my earlier conclusion that d must divide s or s-1 is only a

---------------

 sufficient condition, but not necessary.

Wait, because if d is composite, it could have factors that are in s and s-1.

Wait

---------------

, for example, d=12=3*4. s=9, s-1=8.

So, 3 divides 9, and 4 divides 8. So, 3*4 divides 9*8.

So

---------------

, in this case, d=12 is the product of 3 and 4, and 3 divides s=9, 4 divides s-1=8.

So, in

---------------

 general, if d can be factored into two coprime factors, say m and n, such that m divides s and n divides s-1, then d= m*n divides s*(s-1).

So

---------------

, for d=12, m=3, n=4. Since 3 divides 9 and 4 divides 8, d

---------------

 divides 9*8=72.

So, in this case, s=9 is a solution.

Similarly, for

---------------

 other d's, we can have multiple s's that satisfy d divides s*(s-1) even if d doesn't divide s or s-1 individually, as long as d can be expressed as a product of two coprime factors that each divide s and s-1 respectively.

So, the

---------------

 number of solutions s for each d is equal to the number of ways to write d as a product of two coprime factors m and n, and then find s such that m divides s and n divides s-1.

But

---------------

 this seems a bit abstract. Maybe I can think in terms of the number of divisors.

Alternatively, perhaps for each d, the number of s in 1 to d such that d divides s(s-1) is equal to the number of divisors m of d where m divides s and d/m divides s-1.

But this might get complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps for

---------------

 each d, the number of solutions s is equal to the number of divisors of d, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's take d=6.

d=6. So b=7.

s

---------------

 can be from 1 to 6.

Compute for each s:

s=1: 1*0=0, divisible by 6? 0 is, but a=0 invalid.

s=2: 2*1=2, not divisible by 6.

s=3: 3*2=6, which is divisible by 6. So c=3*(7-3)/(7-1)=3*4/6=12/6=2. c=2. a=3-2=1. So n=1*7 +2=9. sqrt(9)=3, 1+2=3. Correct.

s=4: 4*3=12, which is divisible by 6. c=4*(7-4)/6=4*3/6=12/6=2. a=4-2=2. n=2*7 +2=16. sqrt(16)=4, 2+2=4. Correct.

s=5:5*4=20, not divisible by 6.

s=6:6*5=30, which is divisible by 6. c=6*(7-6)/6=6*1/6=1. a=6-1=5. n=5*7 +1=36. sqrt(36)=6, 5+1=6. Correct.

So for d=6, s=3,4,6 give valid solutions. s=1 and s=6 give

---------------

 c=2 and 1, but s=1 gives a=0 invalid, s=6 gives a=5 valid. So total of three solutions: s=3,4,6.

Wait, so

---------------

 for d=6, there are three solutions.

Similarly, let's check d=4:

d=4, b=5.

s=1: c

---------------

=1, a=0 invalid.

s=2:2*3=6, not divisible by 4.

s=3:3*2=6, not divisible by 4.

s=4:4*3=12, divisible by 4. c=1, a=3. So n=3*5 +1=16. Correct.

So only s=4 gives a solution. So one solution.

Wait, but earlier when

---------------

 d=6, there were three solutions. So the number of solutions can vary.

So, it seems that the number of solutions depends on the number of ways d can be expressed as a product of two coprime factors m and n, such that m divides s and n divides s-1.

But

---------------

 perhaps a better approach is to note that for each d, the number of solutions s is equal to the number of ways to write d as m*n where m and n are coprime, and then solve

---------------

 for s ≡0 mod m and s ≡1 mod n.

Each such pair (m,n) gives a solution s via the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

But

---------------

 since m and n are coprime, there is a unique solution modulo m*n.

But since s must be between 1 and d, each

---------------

 such pair (m,n) would give exactly one solution s in that range.

Therefore, the number of solutions s is equal to the number of ways to factor d into two coprime factors m and n, where m*n

---------------

=d.

But the number of such factorizations is 2^{k-1}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of d.

Because for each prime factor, you can assign it to m or to n, but since m and n are coprime, each prime must go entirely to m or to n.

So

---------------

, the number of coprime factorizations is 2^{k}, but since m and n are unordered, it's 2^{k-1}.

Wait, let me think

---------------

.

For example, d=6=2*3. The coprime factorizations are (1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1). But since m and n are positive integers, and order

---------------

 matters, but in our case, since m divides s and n divides s-1, the order matters because m and n are in specific roles.

Wait, no

---------------

, actually, for each factorization into m and n coprime, with m*n=d, we can have two possibilities: m divides s and n divides s-1, or n divides s and m divides s-1.

But in our case, since

---------------

 m and n are coprime, each factorization (m,n) gives a unique solution s.

Wait, perhaps the

---------------

 number of solutions is equal to the number of such factorizations, which is 2^{k}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of d.

Because for each prime, you can assign it to m or to n.

But let

---------------

 me test this.

Take d=6=2*3. k=2. So number of solutions should be 2^{2}=4.

But earlier, for d=6, we found three solutions: s=3,4,6.

Wait, that

---------------

 doesn't match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of such factorizations where m and n are greater than 1. Or maybe including

---------------

 1.

Wait, for d=6, the coprime factorizations are:

(1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1).

Each of these gives

---------------

 a solution s.

Let me check:

For (m,n)=(1,6):

s ≡0 mod 1 (always true), s ≡1 mod 6.

So s ≡1 mod6. In

---------------

 1<=s<=6, s=1,7,... but s<=6, so s=1. But a=0 invalid.

For (m,n)=(2,3):

s ≡0 mod2, s≡1 mod3.

Find s in 1-6:

s=4: 4≡0 mod2, 4≡1 mod3? 4 mod3=1. Yes. So s=4.

For (m,n)=(3,2):

s≡0 mod3, s≡1 mod2.

Find s in 1-6:

s=3: 3≡0 mod3, 3≡1 mod2? 3 mod2=1. Yes. So s=3.

s=9 would be next, but beyond d=6.

For (m,n)=(6,1):

s≡0 mod6, s≡1 mod1 (always true).

So s=6.

So,

---------------

 the solutions are s=1,3,4,6.

But s=1 gives a=0 invalid, so only s=3,4,6 are valid. So three solutions.

So, the

---------------

 number of valid solutions is equal to the number of coprime factorizations minus the ones where s=1 (which gives a=0 invalid).

But

---------------

 in this case, one of the four factorizations leads to s=1, which is invalid. So, the number of valid solutions is 3.

Similarly, for d=12=2^2*3.

Number of coprime factorizations: factors

---------------

 are pairs (m,n) where m*n=12 and gcd(m,n)=1.

Possible factorizations:

(1,12), (3,4), (4,3), (12,1).

So four factorizations.

Each gives a solution s:

(1,12): s≡0 mod1, s≡1 mod12. So s=1,

---------------

13,... but s<=12, so s=1. a=0 invalid.

(3,4): s≡0 mod3, s≡1 mod4.

Find s: 3 divides

---------------

 s, 4 divides s-1.

s=9: 9 mod3=0, 9 mod4=1. So s=9.

(4,3): s≡0 mod4, s≡1 mod3.

Find s: 4 divides s, 3 divides s-1.

s=4: 4 mod4=0, 4 mod3=1. So s=4.

s=12: 12 mod4=0, 12 mod3=0, which is not 1. So no.

Wait, next would be s=4+ lcm(3,4)=12, which is beyond d=12.

So s=4.

(12,1): s≡0 mod12, s≡1 mod1.

So s=12.

Thus, the solutions are s=1,4,9,12.

s=1 invalid, others valid. So three valid solutions.

Wait, but earlier with

---------------

 d=6, we had three solutions, and d=12 also has three solutions.

Wait, but the number of coprime factorizations is four, but one leads to s=1 which is invalid, so three valid solutions.

But

---------------

 wait, let's take d=4.

d=4=2^2.

Coprime factorizations: (1,4), (4,1).

So two factorizations.

Each gives s:

(1,4): s=1, invalid.

(4,1): s=4, valid.

So only one solution.

Similarly, d=8=2^3.

Coprime factorizations: (1,8), (8,1).

So two factorizations.

s=1 invalid, s=8 valid.

So only one solution.

But d=9=3^2.

Coprime factorizations: (1,9), (9,1).

Two factorizations.

s=1 invalid, s=9 valid.

So one solution.

Wait, but d=12,

---------------

 which has two distinct prime factors, gives three solutions.

Wait, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of cop

---------------

rime factorizations (excluding (1,d)) minus 1 if s=1 is included.

But this seems inconsistent.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of valid solutions is equal to the number of cop

---------------

rime factorizations (m,n) where m>1 and n>1, because when either m=1 or n=1, s=1 or s=d, which may or may not be valid.

Wait, for d=6, the

---------------

 coprime factorizations where both m>1 and n>1 are (2,3) and (3,2). Each gives a solution s=4 and s=3, respectively.

So

---------------

, two solutions from these, plus s=d=6, which gives another solution. So total three.

Similarly, for d=12, the coprime factorizations where both m>1 and n>1 are (3,4) and (4,3). Each gives s=9 and s=4, respectively. Plus s=d=12. So total three solutions.

For d=6, number

---------------

 of solutions is three.

For d=12, number of solutions is three.

Wait, but d=6 has two distinct prime factors, d=12 has two as well.

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to write d as a product of two coprime factors greater than 1, multiplied by 2 (since each such pair (m,n) and (n,m) gives a different s), plus one for s=d.

Wait, but

---------------

 in d=6, the coprime factorizations with m,n>1 are (2,3) and (3,2), each giving a solution. So two solutions from these, plus s=6, total three.

Similarly, for d=12, (3,4) and (4,3) give two solutions, plus s=12, total three.

But for d=8, which is 2^3, the only coprime factorization with m,n>1 is none, because 8 cannot be written as a product of two coprime numbers greater than 1. Because 8=2^3, and any factors would share the factor 2. So, only s=8 is a solution.

Similarly, for d=9=3^2, same thing: can't be written as a product of two coprime factors greater than 1. So only s=9 is a solution.

So, the

---------------

 number of solutions is:

Number of coprime factorizations (m,n) with m>1, n>1, and

---------------

 m*n=d: let's denote this as t.

Then total solutions = t*2 +1.

But for d=6, t=1 (only (2,3)), so 1*2 +1=3.

For d=12, t=1 (only (3,4)), so 1*2 +1=3.

For d=8, t=0, so 0 +1=1.

For d=9, t=0, so 1.

For

---------------

 d=4, t=0, so 1.

But wait, d=12 can be written as 3*4, which are coprime, but also 2*6, which are not coprime. So, t counts only the coprime factorizations where m and n are coprime and both >1.

So, t is the number of such pairs.

So

---------------

, t is equal to the number of ways to write d as a product of two coprime factors greater than 1.

This is equivalent to the number of unordered pairs {m,n} where m and n are coprime, m>1, n>1, and m*n=d.

Each

---------------

 such pair contributes two ordered pairs (m,n) and (n,m), except when m=n, but since m and n are coprime, m=n only if m=n=1, which is excluded.

So, t is the number of unordered coprime pairs {m,n} with m,n>1 and m*n=d.

Thus

---------------

, the number of such pairs is 2^{k-1}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of d.

Because each prime factor can be assigned to m or n, but since m and n are coprime, each prime must go entirely to m or to n.

Thus

---------------

, the number of ordered pairs is 2^{k}, but since unordered, it's 2^{k-1}.

But wait

---------------

, for d=6=2*3, k=2. So t=2^{2-1}=2. But earlier, for d=6, t=1 (

---------------

only (2,3) and (3,2) considered as one unordered pair). So, t=1.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 t=2^{k-1}.

Yes, for d=6, k=2, t=2^{1}=2.

---------------

 But we have only one unordered pair {2,3}, which gives two ordered pairs. So, in terms of ordered pairs, t=2.

But in our case, each ordered pair gives a different s.

For

---------------

 example, (m,n)=(2,3) gives s=4, and (m,n)=(3,2) gives s=3.

So, for each unordered pair, we get two s's.

Thus, the number of solutions s from these is

---------------

 2*t, where t is the number of unordered coprime pairs {m,n} with m,n>1.

Plus

---------------

 the solution s=d.

Thus, total solutions = 2*t +1.

But t is 2^{k-1}.

Wait, for

---------------

 d=6, k=2, t=2^{1}=2 (unordered pairs?), but actually, {2,3} is one unordered pair.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 it's better to think that the number of ordered coprime pairs (m,n) with m,n>1 and m*n=d is 2^{k}.

Because for each prime factor, you can assign it to m or n, leading

---------------

 to 2^{k} ordered pairs.

But since m and n are distinguishable (because one is assigned to divide s, the other to divide s-1), each ordered pair gives a different s.

Thus, for each d with k distinct prime factors, the number of such ordered pairs is 2^{k}.

But in

---------------

 the case of d=6=2*3, k=2, so 2^2=4 ordered pairs.



---------------

But earlier, for d=6, we have four factorizations: (1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1). Among

---------------

 these, only (2,3) and (3,2) are ordered pairs with m,n>1. So, t

---------------

=2.

Thus, the number of ordered pairs with m,n>1 is 2^{k} - 2.



---------------

Wait, because total ordered pairs including m=1 or n=1 is 2^{k}, but we subtract the two cases where m=1 or n=1.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 not exactly.

Alternatively, for d with k distinct prime factors, the number of ordered coprime pairs (m,n) with m,n>1 and m*n=d is 2^{k} - 2.

Because for each prime, you can assign it to m or n, leading to 2^{k} ordered pairs. But two

---------------

 of these are (1,d) and (d,1), which we exclude because m,n>1. So, the

---------------

 number is 2^{k} - 2.

Thus, for d=6, k=2, number of ordered pairs is 2^2 - 2=2. Which matches,

---------------

 since (2,3) and (3,2) are the two.

Similarly, for d=12=2^2*3, k=2, number of ordered pairs is 2^2 -2=2. Indeed

---------------

, (3,4) and (4,3).

So, for each d with k distinct prime factors, the number of ordered coprime pairs (m,n) with m,n>1 is 2^{k} -2.

Thus, the number of solutions s from these is equal to 2^{k} -2.

Plus the solution s=d.

So, total solutions = (2^{k} -2) +1=2^{k} -1.

Wait, but for d=6, k=2, 2^{2} -1=3, which matches.

For d=12, k=2, 2^{2} -1=3, which matches.

For d=8=2^3, k=1, 2^{1} -1=1, which matches.

For d=9=3^2, k=1, 2^{1}-1=1, which matches.

For d=4=2^2, k=1, 2^{1}-1=1, which matches.

For

---------------

 d=2=2, k=1, 2^{1}-1=1. But d=2, b=3.

s can be 1 and 2.

s=1: c=1*(3-1)/(3-1)=2/2=1. a=0 invalid.

s=2: c=2*(3-2)/2=2*1/2=1. a=2-1=1. So n=1*3 +1=4. sqrt(4)=2. Correct. So only one solution, which matches.

So, the

---------------

 formula seems to hold.

Thus, for a given d, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to 2^{k} -1, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of d.

But wait, for

---------------

 d=6, which is 2*3, k=2, so 2^2 -1=3 solutions.

But

---------------

 earlier, when d=6, we had three solutions: s=3,4,6.

Similarly, for d=12=2^2*3, k=2, so 3 solutions.

But

---------------

 wait, d=12 has two distinct prime factors, same as d=6.

So, the number of solutions is 2^{k} -1, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of d.

Thus, for each base b, where d = b -1, the number of b-eautiful numbers is 2^{k} -1, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of d.

But

---------------

 wait, let me check for d=30=2*3*5, k=3.

Number of solutions would be 2^3 -1=7.

Let me test

---------------

 d=30.

d=30, b=31.

We can find s in 1 to30 such that 30 divides s(s-1).

Number

---------------

 of solutions s is 2^{3} -1=7.

So, let's see:

The coprime factorizations of 30 into m and n where m,n>1:



---------------

Each prime can go to m or n.

So, the ordered pairs (m,n) are:

(2,15), (3,10), (5,6), (6,5), (10,3), (15,2), (30,1), (1,30).

But we exclude those

---------------

 with m=1 or n=1, so the remaining are (2,15), (15,2), (3,10), (10,3), (5,6), (6,5). So six ordered pairs.

Each of these gives a solution s.

For

---------------

 example:

(m,n)=(2,15):

s ≡0 mod2, s≡1 mod15.

Find s in 1-30.

s=16: 16 mod2=0, 16 mod15=1. So s=16.

(m,n)=(15,2):

s≡0 mod15, s≡1 mod2.

s=15: 15 mod15=0, 15 mod2=1. So s=15.

(m,n)=(3,10):

s≡0 mod3, s≡1 mod10.

Find s: 3 divides s, 10 divides s-1.

s= 3

---------------

*k, s-1=10*m.

So 3k -10m =1.

Find k and m integers.

Try k=7: 21 -10m=1 → 10m=20 → m=2. So s=21.

Check

---------------

:21 mod3=0, 21 mod10=1. Yes.

(m,n)=(10,3):

s≡0 mod10, s≡1 mod3.

s=10*k, 10k ≡1 mod3.

10 mod3=1, so 10k ≡k mod3 �

---------------

�1 → k=1 mod3.

So s=10,40,... but s<=30, so s=10,40 invalid. s=10: 10 mod10=0, 10 mod3=1. Yes.

(m,n)=(5,6):

s≡0 mod5, s≡1 mod6.

Find s: 5 divides s, 6 divides s-1.

s=5*k, 5k -6*m=1.

Try k=5:25 -6m=1→6m=24→m=4. So s=25.

Check:25 mod5=0, 25 mod6=1. Yes.

(m,n)=(6,5):

s≡0 mod6, s≡1 mod5.

s=6*k, 6k ≡1 mod5.

6 mod5=1, so 6k ≡k mod5≡1 →k=1 mod5.

So s=6,11,16,21,26,31,...

---------------

 but s<=30.

s=6:6 mod6=0,6 mod5=1. Yes.

s=11:11 mod6=5≠0.

Wait, s=6 is

---------------

 the only one in 1-30.

So, the solutions from these pairs are s=15,16,21,10,25,6.

Plus s=30.

So total solutions s=6,10,15,16,21,25,30.

That

---------------

's seven solutions. So, seven b-eautiful numbers for b=31.

Thus, the formula holds.

So, the

---------------

 number of b-eautiful numbers for base b is 2^{k} -1, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of d = b -1.

Thus

---------------

, to find the least b where the number of b-eautiful numbers exceeds ten, we need to find the smallest b such that 2^{k} -1 >10, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of b-1.

So, 2^{k} -1 >10 → 2^{k} >11 →k >=4, since 2^4=16>11.

Thus, we need b-1 to have at least 4 distinct prime factors.

Because then

---------------

 2^4 -1=15>10.

So, the smallest d =b-1 with at least 4 distinct prime factors is the product of the first four primes: 2*3*5*7=210.

Thus, b=211.

But wait, is

---------------

 there a smaller d with four distinct prime factors?

Yes, for example, 2*3*5*7=210 is the smallest number

---------------

 with four distinct primes.

But wait, 2*3*5*7=210.

But is there a smaller d with four distinct prime factors? No, because the first four primes are 2,3,5,7. So 210 is the smallest.

Thus, b=211.

But wait, let me check.



---------------

Wait, 210 is the smallest number with four distinct prime factors.

So, for b=211, d=210, which has four distinct prime factors, so k=4.

Thus, number of b-eautiful numbers is 2^4 -1=15>10.

But is there a smaller b where d has k=4?

Yes, because

---------------

 2*3*5*7=210 is the first, but perhaps another number less than 210 with four distinct prime factors.

Wait, for

---------------

 example, 2*3*5*7=210, which is the smallest.

No, because the primes are in order, so the next would be 2*3*5*11=330, which is larger.

Thus, 210 is the smallest d with four distinct prime factors.

Thus, the least b is 211.

But wait, wait a second. Let's check

---------------

 if d=105=3*5*7 has three distinct prime factors.

k=3, so number of solutions is 2^3 -1=7.

Which is less than 10.

Thus, to

---------------

 get more than ten solutions, we need k>=4.

Thus, the minimal d is 210, leading to b=211.

But wait, let

---------------

 me check for d=60=2^2*3*5, which has three distinct prime factors.

k=3, so 2^3 -1=7<10.

Thus

---------------

, not enough.

Similarly, d=120=2^3*3*5, k=3, solutions=7.

Still not enough.

Thus

---------------

, the first d with four distinct prime factors is 210, so b=211.

Thus, the answer is 211.

But wait, let

---------------

 me check if d=105=3*5*7, which has k=3, so solutions=7.

But

---------------

 wait, d=105 has three distinct prime factors, but what about d=2310=2*3*5*7*11, which has five distinct prime factors.

But that's larger, so not needed.

Thus, the minimal b is 211.


To determine the least integer \( b \geq 2 \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful integers, we analyze the problem as follows:

A positive integer \( n \) is \( b \)-eautiful if it has exactly two digits in base \( b \), and the sum of these digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \). Expressing \( n \) in base \( b \) as \( n = a \cdot b + c \), where \( a \) and \( c \) are digits in base \( b \), the condition becomes \( a + c = \sqrt{a \cdot b + c} \). Squaring both sides gives the equation \( (a + c)^2 = a \cdot b + c \), which simplifies to \( a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a \cdot b + c \). Rearranging terms yields a quadratic equation in \( a \):

\[
a^2 + (2c - b)a + (c^2 - c) = 0
\]

Using the quadratic formula, the discriminant must be a perfect square for \( a \) to be an integer. This leads to the condition that \( b - 1 \) must divide \( s(s - 1) \), where \( s = a + c \). The number of valid \( b \)-eautiful numbers is determined by the number of ways to factor \( b - 1 \) into coprime pairs \( (m, n) \), which is \( 2^{k} - 1 \), where \( k \) is the number of distinct prime factors of \( b - 1 \).

To exceed ten \( b \)-eautiful numbers, we need \( 2^{k} - 1 > 10 \), which requires \( k \geq 4 \). The smallest \( b - 1 \) with four distinct prime factors is \( 210 \) (the product of the first four primes: 2, 3, 5, 7). Thus, \( b = 211 \).

The least integer \( b \) is:
