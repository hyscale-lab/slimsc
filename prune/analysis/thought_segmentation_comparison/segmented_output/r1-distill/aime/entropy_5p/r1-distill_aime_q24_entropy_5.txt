Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to make sense of it step by step. 



---------------

First, the problem says there are 900 residents in total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. So, candy

---------------

 hearts are like a given for everyone. Then, there are other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers are 195 own

---------------

 a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. 

Wait

---------------

, so these are the counts for each item, but some people might own more than one. The problem also mentions that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The

---------------

 question is asking for the number of residents who own all four—so candy hearts, diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade. 

Hmm, this

---------------

 seems like a problem that involves sets and Venn diagrams. Maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion? I remember that inclusion

---------------

-exclusion helps calculate the union of multiple sets by adding up their individual sizes, subtracting the intersections, and so on.

But wait, the

---------------

 problem here is about four sets: diamond rings (D), golf clubs (G), garden spades (S), and candy hearts (C). But since

---------------

 everyone owns C, it's like the universal set. So, actually, all the residents are part of C. So, when

---------------

 considering the other three items, we can think of them as subsets of C.

Let me denote the number of people who own exactly k of the three items (D, G, S) as something

---------------

. Wait, the problem states that 437 own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. But wait

---------------

, these numbers are for exactly two and exactly three among D, G, S, right? Because candy hearts are already included in everyone.

Wait, no

---------------

, the problem says, "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, the other

---------------

 items (diamond, golf, spade) are in addition to the candy hearts. So, when they say 437 own exactly two of these things, it

---------------

's referring to exactly two of the four? Or exactly two of the three other things?

Wait, let me read the problem again. It says, "437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things." The "these things" probably

---------------

 refer to the four items: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. Because the way it's phrased is about

---------------

 all four.

Wait, but candy hearts are owned by everyone. So, if someone owns exactly two of the four things, does

---------------

 that include candy hearts? Because if candy hearts are already given, then owning exactly two would mean two of the other three.

---------------

 Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe it's better to think that since candy hearts are universal, we can model

---------------

 the problem with three sets: D, G, S, all subsets of the universal set C (which is all 900 residents). So, the

---------------

 problem reduces to three sets within the universal set.

But then the problem says that 437 own exactly two of the four things, but since everyone

---------------

 has C, perhaps exactly two of D, G, S. Similarly, 234 own exactly three of the four, which would translate to exactly three of D, G, S,

---------------

 because they already have C.

Wait, but that might not be accurate. Let me think again.

Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so when

---------------

 the problem talks about residents owning exactly two or three things, it's referring to the four items. So, if someone owns exactly two, that could

---------------

 include the candy hearts. So, for example, someone who owns candy hearts and a diamond ring would count as owning exactly two of the four things.

Wait

---------------

, but that complicates things because now we have four sets, including the universal set. But in inclusion-exclusion problems, the

---------------

 universal set isn't typically considered as an item to be owned, since everyone has it. So, perhaps the way to approach this is to consider only the three items:

---------------

 D, G, S, and model their overlaps, considering that everyone has C.

So, the counts for exactly two and exactly three are

---------------

 about D, G, S. That is, 437 people own exactly two of D, G, S, and 234 own exactly three of them. So

---------------

, the four items include C, but when considering how many people own two or three items, we're only counting D, G, S,

---------------

 because C is already included in everyone.

So, given that, let's model this with three sets: D, G, S.

We

---------------

 can use the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets. The formula is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|

But wait

---------------

, we don't know |D ∪ G ∪ S|, but since everyone owns C, and the other items are subsets

---------------

 of C, the total number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is |D ∪ G ∪ S|. But since

---------------

 everyone owns C, perhaps all 900 own at least C, but some may own more. Hmm, but in

---------------

 this problem, the numbers for D, G, S are given, but we don't know the overlaps.

But maybe I

---------------

 can model the problem by considering the numbers of people in each possible category: owning only D, only G, only S, exactly two of them, exactly three, and those

---------------

 who own only C.

Wait, but the problem says that 437 own exactly two of these things (including C?),

---------------

 and 234 own exactly three. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model

---------------

 this using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for four sets, but since C is universal, maybe we can ignore it in the counts

---------------

 except for the fact that everyone has it.

Wait, but the problem is about four things: D, G, S, C. But

---------------

 since C is universal, everyone has it, so the number of people who have all four is equal to the number of people who have D, G, and S, because C is already included.

So, the

---------------

 problem reduces to finding |D ∩ G ∩ S|, which is the number of people who own all three of

---------------

 D, G, S. Because those who own all four would be exactly |D ∩ G ∩ S|, since C is already given

---------------

.

So, if I can find |D ∩ G ∩ S|, that would be the answer.

But to find that, I can use inclusion-exclusion for three sets,

---------------

 but I need to know the number of people in the union of D, G, S. But since everyone owns C, the

---------------

 union of D, G, S is the number of people who own at least one of D, G, S. But

---------------

 how do I find that?

Wait, the total number of residents is 900. Each resident owns C, which is one

---------------

 item, plus possibly D, G, S. So, the total number of people owning at least one of D, G, S would be equal

---------------

 to the number of people who own any of these three, but since C is already included, the total number of people is

---------------

 900. But actually, the number of people who own at least one of D, G, S can be found

---------------

 by considering the given numbers.

Wait, no. Because some people might own only C, while others own C plus one, two, or three of D, G, S.

Wait

---------------

, the problem states that 437 own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. But wait

---------------

, these are in addition to C, right? Because if they owned exactly two of the four things, including C, that would mean they own C plus one other. Similarly, exactly three would mean C plus two others.

Wait, but

---------------

 the problem says, "437 residents who own exactly two of these things." So, each of the four items is

---------------

 considered here. So, for example, a person could own C and D, which would be two things. Or C and G, etc. So, in

---------------

 this case, the 437 is the number of people who own exactly two of the four things, which would include C plus

---------------

 one other, or maybe two others not involving C?

Wait, no. If someone owns exactly two of the four things, including

---------------

 C, that would mean they own C plus one more. So, for example, C and D is two things. Similarly

---------------

, C and G is two, C and S is two. Or, if they don't own C, but own two others, but wait, since

---------------

 everyone owns C, that's not possible. So, actually, all residents own C, so the only way to own exactly two things is to own C plus exactly one of D, G, or S.

Wait, no

---------------

, that can't be. Because if someone owns C, D, and G, that's three things. So, the

---------------

 437 is the number of people who own exactly two of the four things, which, since C is already owned

---------------

 by everyone, they must own C plus one more. So, 437 people own exactly two things: C and one other.

Similarly, the 234 own exactly three things: C plus two others. And

---------------

 the people who own all four would be those who have C, D, G, and S. So, that's four

---------------

 things. But wait, the problem is asking for the number of people who own all four, which would be the number of people in the intersection of D, G, S, and C. But since C is universal, it's just the intersection of D, G, S.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 it's better to model this with a Venn diagram approach, considering the three sets D, G, S, and the

---------------

 counts of people in each region.

Let me denote:

- a: number of people who own only C.
- b: number of people who own C and D only.
- c: number of people who own C and G only.
- d: number of people who own C and S only.
- e: number of people who own C, D, and G only.
- f: number of people who own C, D, and S only.
- g: number of people who own C, G, and S only.
- h: number of people who own all four, which is C, D, G, S.

Wait, but wait

---------------

, the problem says that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so a is zero because everyone owns C. So, a=0.

Now

---------------

, the problem states that 437 own exactly two of these four things. Since everyone owns C, the only way to have exactly two is to have C plus exactly one of D, G, S. So, the

---------------

 number of people who own exactly two things is the sum of those who own C and D only, C and G only, and C and S only. So, b + c + d = 437.

Similarly, the number of people who own exactly three of these four things is the sum of those who own C, D, G only; C, D, S only; C, G, S only; and all four. Wait, no, exactly

---------------

 three would exclude the ones who own all four. So, exactly three would be e + f + g = 234.

Wait, but the

---------------

 problem states that 234 own exactly three of the four things, which includes C. So, someone who owns exactly three would have C plus two others. So, exactly

---------------

 three is e + f + g = 234.

And the number of people who own all four (h) is what we're trying to find.

Now

---------------

, the total number of people is 900. So, let's sum up all the regions:

a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 900.

But a=0, so:

b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 900.

We also have:

b + c + d = 437 (exactly two things)


---------------

e + f + g = 234 (exactly three things)
h = ? (exactly four things)

So, substituting these

---------------

 into the total:

437 + 234 + h = 900.

Wait, that's because:



---------------

b + c + d = 437
e + f + g = 234
h = ?

So, 437 + 234 + h = 900 →

---------------

 671 + h = 900 → h = 900 - 671 = 229.

Wait, that would give

---------------

 h=229. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if I did that correctly.

Wait, no

---------------

, that's incorrect. Because the regions e, f, g are exactly those who have three things, and h is those with four. So, the

---------------

 total number of people is the sum of all regions, which is:

b + c + d (exactly two) + e + f + g (exactly three) + h (exactly four) = 900.

So, 437 + 234 + h = 900 → h = 900 - 437 - 234.

Calculating that: 437 + 234 = 671. 900 - 671 = 229. So, h=229.

But wait, the

---------------

 problem is that this approach ignores the individual counts for D, G, S. Because we have |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562. So, we

---------------

 might need to use inclusion-exclusion with these numbers.

Wait, maybe I oversimplified it. Let me think again.

Each

---------------

 of D, G, S has a certain number of owners. So, the total number of people owning D is 195, which includes those who own only D (with

---------------

 C), those who own D and G (with C), D and S, D and G and S, etc.

Similarly for G and S.

So, perhaps I should write

---------------

 the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets and use the given numbers.

The formula is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|

But we

---------------

 don't know |D ∪ G ∪ S|, but since everyone owns C, |D ∪ G ∪ S| is the number of people who own at least one of D, G, S, which is equal to 900 minus the number of people who own only C. But wait, since

---------------

 everyone owns C, the only way someone doesn't own D, G, or S is if they own only C. But earlier

---------------

, I thought a=0 because everyone owns C, but that's not correct. Wait, a is the number of people who own only C. So, if

---------------

 a>0, then |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 900 - a.

But earlier, I considered a=0, but that might not be the case. Because the problem states that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, but doesn

---------------

't say anything about owning at least one of D, G, S. So, a can be non-zero.

Wait, but in

---------------

 the problem statement, the numbers given are for those who own D, G, S. So, perhaps a is the number of people who don't own any of D, G, S, and

---------------

 thus own only C.

So, let me adjust the approach.

Let me denote:

a = number of people who own only C (

---------------

no D, G, S)
b = C and D only
c = C and G only
d = C and S only
e = C, D, G only
f = C, D, S only
g = C, G, S only
h = all four (C, D, G, S)

So, total residents

---------------

: a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 900.

The problem says that 437 own exactly two of these things. Which

---------------

, in this case, would be b + c + d = 437.

Similarly, exactly three would be e + f + g = 234.

And

---------------

 exactly four would be h, which is what we need to find.

Now, the number of people who own D is |D| = 195. So

---------------

, |D| = b + e + f + h.

Similarly, |G| = 367 = c + e + g + h.

|S| = 562 = d + f + g + h.

We

---------------

 can set up equations based on these.

So, let's write down:

1. b + c + d = 437
2. e + f + g = 234
3. a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 900
4. b + e + f + h = 195
5. c + e + g + h = 367
6. d + f + g + h = 562

We have six equations with variables a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h.

But since

---------------

 we're looking for h, maybe we can express other variables in terms of h and substitute.

From equation 3:

a = 900 - (b + c + d + e + f + g + h)
But from equations 1 and 2:

b + c + d =437; e + f + g=234.



---------------

So, a = 900 - (437 + 234 + h) → a=900 - (671 + h) = 229 - h.

Now

---------------

, let's look at equations 4,5,6.

Equation 4: b + e + f + h =195

Equation5: c + e + g + h=367

Equation6: d + f + g + h=562

Let

---------------

 me add equations 4,5,6:

(b + e + f + h) + (c + e + g + h) + (d + f + g + h) = 195 + 367 + 562.

S

---------------

implify left side:

b + c + d + 2e + 2f + 2g + 3h.

We

---------------

 know from equation1: b + c + d =437.

From equation2: e + f + g=234.

So, left side becomes:

437 + 2*(234) + 3h = 437 + 468 + 3h = 905 +3h.

Right side: 195 + 367 = 562, 562 +562= 1129? Wait, no. Wait, 195 + 367 is 562, plus 562 is 1124. So, 195+367+562= 1124.

So, 905 +3h=1124 → 3h=1124-905=219 → h=73.

Wait, that's

---------------

 different from the 229 I thought earlier. So, h=73.

Wait, but earlier when I thought

---------------

 h=229, I didn't consider the individual counts for D, G, S. So, perhaps this is the correct approach.

Let me double

---------------

-check the calculations.

Adding equations 4,5,6:

Equation4: b + e + f + h =195
Equation5: c + e + g + h=367
Equation6: d + f + g + h=562

Sum:

---------------

 (b + c + d) + (e + e + f + f) + (g + g) + 3h = 195+367+562.

Wait, no

---------------

, better to sum each term:

b + c + d is 437.

e appears twice in equation4 and 5: e

---------------

 + e =2e.

f appears in equation4 and 6: f + f = 2f.

g appears in equation5 and 6: g + g=2g.

h appears three times: h + h + h=3h.

So, total sum:

---------------

 437 + 2e + 2f + 2g +3h.

But from equation2: e + f + g=234 → 2e + 2f + 2g= 2*234=468.

So, total sum:437 +468 +3h=905 +3h.

Which

---------------

 equals the sum of the RHS:195+367+562=1124.

So, 905 +3h=1124 →3h=219 →h=73.

So, the number of people who own all four is 73.

Wait, but earlier I thought h

---------------

=229, which was based on the assumption that a=0, but that's not the case. Because when

---------------

 considering the individual counts for D, G, S, we have to account for their overlaps, which led us to h=73.

So, the correct answer should be 73.

Wait, but let me make

---------------

 sure that this makes sense. Let's see if all the numbers add up.

We have h=73.

From equation4: b + e + f +73=195 → b + e + f=122.

From equation5: c + e + g +73=367 → c + e + g=294.

From equation6: d + f + g +73=562 → d + f + g=489.

Now

---------------

, from equation1: b + c + d=437.

From equation2: e + f + g=234.

Let

---------------

 me see if I can find other variables.

We can express e + f + g=234.

From equation4: b + e + f=122 → b=122 - e -f.

From equation5: c + e + g=294 → c=294 -e -g.

From equation6: d + f + g=489 → d=489 -f -g.

Now, equation

---------------

1: b + c + d=437.

Substituting b, c, d:

(122 - e - f) + (294 - e - g) + (489 - f - g) =437.

Simplify:

122 + 294 +489 - e -f -e -g -f -g =437.

Sum

---------------

 of numbers: 122+294=416; 416+489=905.

So

---------------

, 905 -2e -2f -2g =437.

But from equation2: e + f + g=234 → 2e +2f +2g=468.

So, 905 -468=437.

Which is

---------------

 437=437. So, this checks out.

So, all the equations are consistent, and h=73 is the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we model the ownership of diamond rings (D), golf clubs (G), and garden spades (S) among the 900 residents of Aimeville, where everyone owns a bag of candy hearts (C). We use

---------------

 the principle of inclusion-exclusion and define the following regions based on ownership:

- \( b \): Residents who own C and D only.
- \( c \): Residents who own C and G only.
- \( d \): Residents who own C and S only.
- \( e \): Residents who own C, D, and G only.
- \( f \): Residents who own C, D, and S only.
- \( g \): Residents who own C, G, and S only.
- \( h \): Residents who own all four items (C, D, G, S).

Given:
- \( b + c + d = 437 \) (exactly two items, including C).
- \( e + f + g = 234 \) (exactly three items, including C).
- \( |D| = 195 \), \( |G| = 367 \), \( |S| = 562 \).

Using the inclusion-exclusion principle for the three

---------------

 sets D, G, and S, we set up the following equations:

1. \( b + e + f + h = 195 \) (for

---------------

 D).
2. \( c + e + g + h = 367 \) (for G).
3. \( d + f + g + h = 562 \) (for S).

Adding these three equations:

\[
(b + e + f + h) + (c + e + g + h) + (d + f + g + h) = 195 + 367 + 562
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
(b + c + d) + 2(e + f + g) + 3h = 1124
\]

Substituting \( b + c + d = 437 \) and \( e + f + g = 234 \):

\[
437 + 2(234) + 3h = 1124
\]

\[
437 + 468 + 3h = 1124
\]

\[
905 + 3h = 1124
\]

Solving for \( h \):

\[
3h = 219 \quad \Rightarrow \quad h = 73
\]

Thus, the number of residents who own all four items is:

\boxed{73}<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
