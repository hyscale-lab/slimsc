Okay, so I have this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to parse what's being asked.

The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. That's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis is along the x-axis because the positive term is with x².

Now

---------------

, points A, B, C, D are on this hyperbola, and they form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. That

---------------

 makes sense because in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other.

I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, essentially

---------------

, I'm looking for the infimum of BD², the lower bound, but expressed as the greatest number less than BD². Wait

---------------

, no, wait. The problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So that would be the infimum of BD² across

---------------

 all possible such rhombi. Because BD² can get arbitrarily close to some minimum value, and we're looking for the greatest

---------------

 number that is still less than all BD². So, maybe the infimum is the minimum possible BD², and we

---------------

 have to find that.

Wait, actually, let me think again. If we have multiple rhombi, each with their own BD². The problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. That is

---------------

, find the maximum lower bound for BD² across all possible rhombi. So, it's like the infimum of BD².

---------------

 Because the infimum is the greatest lower bound. So, yes, the answer would be the infimum of BD².

So, I

---------------

 need to find the minimum possible value of BD², which is the square of the length of one of the diagonals of the rhombus, and

---------------

 then express it as the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi. So, if the minimum BD² is m

---------------

, then the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi would be m itself, but if BD² can be

---------------

 as small as m, then m is the infimum. Wait, but the problem says "less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, perhaps

---------------

 it's the infimum. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe BD² can approach a certain limit, but never actually reach it. So, the infimum would be that limit. So

---------------

, I need to find the minimum possible BD² across all rhombi, but maybe it's not attainable, so the infimum is that

---------------

 value.

But let's move on and try to model the problem.

Given that ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, which

---------------

 is the midpoint. So, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin. So, points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other.

Since the hyperbola is symmetric about both axes, and

---------------

 the origin is the center, the rhombus must be symmetric with respect to both axes as well. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, points B and D must be symmetric in some way. Since

---------------

 the diagonals intersect at the origin, they must pass through the origin. So, the diagonals are the lines connecting A to C and B to D.

In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular to each other. Wait, no, that

---------------

's only in a square. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Yes

---------------

, that's correct. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular.

Therefore, the lines

---------------

 AC and BD are perpendicular and intersect at the origin.

So, if points A and C are on the hyperbola, and

---------------

 points B and D are also on the hyperbola, with diagonals AC and BD being perpendicular, intersecting at the origin.

So

---------------

, let's model the points. Let me denote points A, B, C, D as follows: since it's a rhombus, the sides

---------------

 are equal, but the diagonals are perpendicular.

Let me denote point A as (x, y), so point C is (-x, -y). Similarly, since

---------------

 the diagonals are perpendicular, the other diagonal BD must be along a line perpendicular to AC.

The line AC has a slope of (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x. So, the slope of BD, being perpendicular, must be -x/y.

So

---------------

, the diagonal BD is a line through the origin with slope -x/y.

Therefore, points B and D lie on this line,

---------------

 so their coordinates can be expressed as (t, (-x/y) t) for some parameter t.

But points B and D are also on the hyperbola. So, substituting into the hyperbola equation:

x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

Wait, no. For

---------------

 points B and D, which are (t, (-x/y) t), substituting into the hyperbola equation:

t² / 20 - [(-x/y t)²] / 24 = 1.

Simplify that:

t² / 20 - (x² t² / y²) / 24 = 1.

Factor out t²:

t² [1/20 - (x²)/(24 y²)] = 1.

So, t² = 1 / [1/20 - (x²)/(24 y²)].

But wait

---------------

, t² must be positive, so the denominator must be positive. So,

1/20 - (x²)/(24 y²) > 0.

So

---------------

,

(24 y² - 20 x²) / (24*20 y²) > 0.

Which

---------------

 implies 24 y² - 20 x² > 0.

But the hyperbola equation is x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, so x

---------------

² = 20(1 + y²/24). Let's substitute that into the inequality.

24 y² - 20 * [20(1 + y²/24)] > 0.

Wait, that

---------------

 might get messy. Let me compute 24 y² - 20 x².

But since x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, x

---------------

² = 20(1 + y²/24). So,

24 y² - 20 x² = 24 y² - 20 * [20(1 + y²/24)] = 24 y² - 400(1 + y²/24).

Let

---------------

's compute that:

24 y² - 400 - (400 y²)/24.

Simplify the

---------------

 terms:

Convert 24 y² to 24*24 y² /24 to have a common denominator.

Wait, maybe

---------------

 it's better to compute it as:

24 y² - 400 - (400 y²)/24 = (24^2 y² - 400 *24 - 400 y²) /24.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I should compute it step by step.

Compute 24 y² - 400 - (400 y²)/24.

Convert

---------------

 24 y² to (24^2 y²)/24 to have a common denominator.

24 y² = (576 y²)/24.

So,

(576 y²)/24 - 400 - (400 y²)/24 = [576 y² - 400 y²]/24 - 400 = (176 y²)/24 - 400.

Simplify:

176/24 = 22/3.

So,

(22/3) y² - 400 > 0.

So

---------------

,

(22/3) y² > 400

y² > (400 * 3)/22 = 1200/22 ≈ 54.545.

So, y² must be greater than approximately 54.545 for the denominator to be positive, which

---------------

 allows t² to be positive.

Hmm, that's interesting. So, for points B and D to exist on the hyperbola on the line with slope -x/y, the

---------------

 y-coordinate of A must satisfy y² > 1200/22.

Wait, let me check my calculations

---------------

 again because that seems a bit high.

Wait, starting again.

Given that points B and D are (t, (-x/y) t). Sub

---------------

stituting into hyperbola:

t² /20 - [ ( (-x/y) t )² ] /24 = 1.

Which is t² [1/20 - (x²)/(24 y²)] =1.

So, t² = 1 / [1/20 - (x²)/(24 y²)].

We

---------------

 need 1/20 - (x²)/(24 y²) > 0.

So, (24 y² - 20 x²) / (24*20 y²) > 0.

Which

---------------

 implies 24 y² - 20 x² >0.

But from the hyperbola equation, x² = 20(1 + y²/24).

So, substit

---------------

uting:

24 y² -20 * [20(1 + y²/24)] >0.

Compute that

---------------

:

24 y² - 400(1 + y²/24) >0.

Multiply out:

24 y² - 400 - (400 y²)/24 >0.

Convert

---------------

 24 y² to 24^2 y² /24:

24 y² = (576 y²)/24.

So,

(576 y²)/24 - (400 y²)/24 - 400 >0.

Combine terms:

(576 y² - 400 y²)/24 - 400 >0.

Which

---------------

 is (176 y²)/24 - 400 >0.

Simplify:

176/24 = 22/3.

So,

(22/3)y² - 400 >0.

Then

---------------

,

(22/3)y² >400.

Multiply both sides by 3/22:

y² > (400 *3)/22 = 1200/22 ≈54.545.

So, yes, y² must be greater than approximately 54.545 for t

---------------

² to be positive, meaning points B and D exist on the hyperbola on that line.

So, that's a condition

---------------

 on point A. So, point A must lie on the hyperbola such that y² > 1200/22.

So

---------------

, perhaps point A is in the upper or lower part of the hyperbola beyond a certain point.

Now, moving on.

So

---------------

, the diagonal BD is along the line with slope -x/y, passing through the origin, and points B and D are at (t, (-x/y) t) and (-t, (x/y) t), since

---------------

 they are symmetric with respect to the origin.

Wait, no, if the line is through the origin with slope m, then points are

---------------

 (t, m t) and (-t, -m t). So, in this case, m = -x/y, so points B and D are (t, (-x/y) t) and (-t, (x/y) t).

So, the

---------------

 length of BD is the distance between (t, (-x/y) t) and (-t, (x/y) t).

Compute

---------------

 that distance:

sqrt[ (t - (-t))² + ( (-x/y t) - (x/y t) )² ]

Which is sqrt[ (2t)² + ( (-2x/y t) )² ] = sqrt[4t² + 4x² t² / y² ] = 2t sqrt(1 + x² / y² ).

So, BD² = [2t sqrt(1 + x²/y²)]² = 4t² (1 + x² / y²).

But from earlier, t² = 1 / [1/20 - x²/(24 y²)].

So, BD

---------------

² = 4 * [1 / (1/20 - x²/(24 y²))] * (1 + x²/y²).

Let

---------------

 me compute that.

First, let's compute 1 + x²/y².

From the hyperbola equation, x²/20 - y²/24 =1. Let's solve for x²:

x² =20(1 + y²/24).

So,

x²/y² = 20(1 + y²/24)/y² =20/y² + 20/(24) =20/y² + 5/6.

So, 1 + x²/y² =1 +20/y² +5/6= (6/6 +5/6) +20/y²=11/6 +20/y².

So, BD²=4*(1/[1/20 -x²/(24 y²)])*(11/6 +20/y²).

Now, let's compute the denominator 

---------------

1/20 -x²/(24 y²).

From x²=20(1 + y²/24), so x²/(24 y²)=20(1 + y²/24)/(24 y²)= [20/(24 y²)] + [20 y²/(24 y²)].

Simplify:

20/(24 y²) =5/(6 y²).

20 y²/(24 y²)=20/24=5/6.

So,

x²/(24 y²)=5/(6 y²) +5/6.

Thus,

1/20 -x²/(24 y²)=1/20 -5/(6 y²) -5/6.

So

---------------

,

Denominator D=1/20 -5/(6 y²) -5/6.

Let me combine terms:

1

---------------

/20 -5/6 = (3/60 -50/60)= (-47/60).

So,

D= -47/60 -5/(6 y²).

So

---------------

,

BD²=4 * [1/(D)] * (11/6 +20/y²).

Substituting D:

BD²=4 * [1/( -47/60 -5/(6 y²) )] * (11/6 +20/y²).

Hmm

---------------

, this looks a bit complicated, but perhaps we can simplify it.

Let me factor out some terms.

First, note that:



---------------

Denominator D= -47/60 -5/(6 y²)= - (47/60 +5/(6 y²)).

So,

1/D= -1/(47/60 +5/(6 y²)).

So,

BD²=4 * [ -1/(47/60 +5/(6 y²)) ] * (11/6 +20/y²).

But

---------------

 BD² must be positive, so the negative sign must be accounted for.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier

---------------

.

Wait, the denominator D=1/20 -x²/(24 y²)=1/20 - [20(1 + y²/24)]/(24 y²).

Which is 1/20 - [20/(24 y²) + 20 y²/(24 y²)].

Which

---------------

 is 1/20 - [5/(6 y²) +5/6].

So,

D=1/20 -5/(6 y²) -5/6.

Compute

---------------

 1/20 -5/6:

1/20 = 3/60,

5/6 =50/60,

So,

3/60 -50/60= -47/60.

Thus,

D= -47/60 -5/(6 y²).

Yes, that's correct.

So, D

---------------

 is negative because both terms are negative. So, 1/D is negative.

But BD² is positive, so when I multiply

---------------

 4 * [1/D] * (11/6 +20/y²), it's 4*(negative)*(positive),

---------------

 so it's negative. That can't be, because BD² is positive.

Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake in the

---------------

 direction of the diagonal.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered points B and D as (t, (x/y) t) and (-t, -(x/y) t), but

---------------

 that would be if the slope is positive x/y, but the slope of BD is perpendicular to AC, which had slope y/x. So, the slope of BD should be -x/y, which

---------------

 is negative if x and y are positive.

Wait, but the points (t, (-x/y) t) and (-t, (x/y) t) would be

---------------

 symmetric across the origin. So, their distance would still be correct.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the hyperbola is

---------------

 symmetric, so when I plug in the points, I have to make sure that they lie on the hyperbola.

Wait, but

---------------

 maybe I made a mistake in the direction of the slope. Let me think again.

The slope of AC is y/x, so the slope of BD is -x/y. So, if

---------------

 point A is (x,y), then the line BD has slope -x/y.

So, points on BD are (t, (-x/y) t). So, for

---------------

 t positive and negative, you get two points symmetric about the origin.

So, their coordinates are (t, (-x/y) t) and (-t, (x/y) t).

So, the

---------------

 distance between these two points is sqrt[(2t)^2 + (2x t / y)^2] = 2t sqrt(1 + (x²/y²)).

So, BD squared

---------------

 is 4 t² (1 + x²/y²).

But t² is 1/(1/20 - x²/(24 y²)).

So, BD²=4*(1/(1/20 -x²/(24 y²)))*(1 +x²/y²).

Wait

---------------

, earlier I had 1 + x²/y² as 11/6 +20/y², but that might

---------------

 have been incorrect.

Wait, let me recompute 1 + x²/y².

From hyperbola equation, x²=20(1 + y²/24).

So,

x²/y²=20(1 + y²/24)/y²=20/y² +20/(24)=20/y² +5/6.

Thus,

1 +x²/y²=1 +20/y² +5/6= (6/6 +5/6) +20/y²=11/6 +20/y².

Yes, that part was correct.

So, BD

---------------

²=4*(1/(D))*(11/6 +20/y²), where D=1/20 -x²/(24 y²)= -47/60 -5/(6 y²).

So,

BD²=4*(1/( -47/60 -5/(6 y²) ))*(11/6 +20/y²).

Let

---------------

 me factor out the negative sign:

BD²=4*(-1/(47/60 +5/(6 y²)))*(11/6 +20/y²).

But BD² is positive, so the

---------------

 negative sign must be canceled. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the direction.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is positive

---------------

? Let me check.

Wait, from earlier, we saw that 24 y² -20 x²>0.



---------------

But from the hyperbola equation, x²=20(1 + y²/24).

So,

24 y² -20 x²=24 y² -20*20(1 + y²/24)=24 y² -400 - (400 y²)/24.

Which is

---------------

 24 y² -400 - (16.666... y²)= (24 -16.666...) y² -400.

Which is approximately 7.333 y² -400.

Wait

---------------

, but earlier I had:

24 y² -20 x²=22/3 y² -400>0.

Wait

---------------

, 22/3≈7.333.

So, 7.333 y² -400>0 implies

---------------

 y²>400/(22/3)=400*3/22≈54.545.

So, when

---------------

 y²>54.545, 24 y² -20 x²>0, which makes

---------------

 D=1/20 -x²/(24 y²)= positive?

Wait, no, wait.

Wait, D=1/20 -x²/(24 y²)= [24 y² -20 x²]/(24*20 y²).

So

---------------

, if 24 y² -20 x²>0, then D is positive.

But earlier, I thought D was negative, but that must

---------------

 have been a miscalculation.

Wait, yes, because:

D= [24 y² -20 x²]/(24*20 y²).

If 24 y² -20 x²>0, then D>0.

So, that

---------------

 would mean t² is positive, as 1/D is positive.

So, BD² is positive.

So, that was

---------------

 my mistake earlier. So, BD² is positive because D is positive.

So, BD²=4*(1/D)*(11/6 +20/y²)=4*(24*20 y²/(24 y² -20 x²))*(11/6 +20/y²).

But since

---------------

 x²=20(1 + y²/24), let's substitute that into D:

D=1/20 -x²/(24 y²)= [24 y² -20 x²]/(24*20 y²).

So

---------------

, 24 y² -20 x²=24 y² -20*(20(1 + y²/24))=24 y² -400 - (400 y²)/24.

Which

---------------

 is (24 y² - (400 y²)/24) -400.

Compute 24 y² - (400 y²)/24:

24 y² = (24^2 y²)/24=576 y²/24.

So,

576 y²/24 -400 y²/24= (576 y² -400 y²)/24=176 y²/24=22 y²/3.

So,

24 y² -20 x²=22 y²/3 -400.

So,

D=(22 y²/3 -400)/(24*20 y²).

Thus

---------------

,

1/D=24*20 y²/(22 y²/3 -400).

So,

BD²=4*(24*20 y²/(22 y²/3 -400))*(11/6 +20/y²).

Simplify this

---------------

 expression.

First, compute 24*20=480.

So,

BD²=4*(480 y²/(22 y²/3 -400))*(11/6 +20/y²).

Let

---------------

 me write 22 y²/3 -400 as (22 y² -1200)/3.

So,

BD²=4*(480 y² / [(22 y² -1200)/3 ])*(11/6 +20/y²).

Simplify the division:

480 y² / [(22 y² -1200)/3 ]=480 y² *3/(22 y² -1200)=1440 y²/(22 y² -1200).

So,

BD²=4*(1440 y²/(22 y² -1200))*(11/6 +20/y²).

Now

---------------

, compute 11/6 +20/y²= (11 y² +120)/6 y².

So,

BD²=4*(1440 y²/(22 y² -1200))*((11 y² +120)/(6 y²)).

Simplify:



---------------

4 * [1440 y² * (11 y² +120) ] / [ (22 y² -1200) *6 y² ].

Simplify numerator and denominator:

1440 /6=240.

y² in numerator cancels with y² in denominator.

So,

BD²=4*(240*(11 y² +120))/(22 y² -1200).

S

---------------

implify 4*240=960.

So,

BD²=960*(11 y² +120)/(22 y² -1200).

Now

---------------

, let me write 22 y² -1200 as 22(y² - 1200/22)=22(y² - 54.545...).

But

---------------

 perhaps factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator:11 y² +120=11 y² +120.

Denominator:22 y² -1200=22(y² - 1200/22).

Hmm

---------------

, perhaps factor 11:

Numerator:11(y² + 120/11)=11(y² + 10.909...).

Denominator:22(y² - 54.545...)=22(y² - 54.545...).

So,

BD²=960*(11(y² +120/11))/(22(y² - 54.545)).

Simplify 11/22=1/2.

So,

BD²=960*(1/2)*(y² +120/11)/(y² - 54.545).

Which is 480*(y² +120/11)/(y² - 54.545).

But

---------------

 54.545 is 1200/22=54.545...

Wait, 120/11≈10.909.

So,

BD²=480*(y² +10.909)/(y² -54.545).

Let

---------------

 me write it as:

BD²=480*(y² + 120/11)/(y² - 1200/22).

But

---------------

 1200/22=600/11≈54.545.

So,

BD²=480*(y² + 120/11)/(y² -600/11).

Let me write

---------------

 this as:

BD²=480*(y² + a)/(y² - b), where a=120/11, b=600/11.

So

---------------

,

BD²=480*(y² +120/11)/(y² -600/11).

Now

---------------

, let me set z=y². Since y²>54.545 (which is 600/11≈54.545), z>600/11.

So, BD²=480*(z +120/11)/(z -600/11).

S

---------------

implify numerator and denominator:

(z +120/11)=z + (120/11).

(z -600/11)=z - (600/11).

So,

BD²=480*(z +120/11)/(z -600/11).

We can write this as:

BD²=480*(z +120/11)/(z -600/11).

Now, let

---------------

 me write this as:

BD²=480*(z +120/11)/(z -600/11)=480*[(z -600/11 +720/11)]/(z -600/11).

Because 120/11=720/66, but perhaps

---------------

 I can express z +120/11 as (z -600/11) +720/11.

Yes

---------------

, because:

(z -600/11) +720/11= z + (720/11 -600/11)=z +120/11.

So,

BD²=480*[ (z -600/11) +720/11 ]/(z -600/11).

Which is 480*[1 + (720/11)/(z -600/11)].

So,

BD²=480 + 480*(720/11)/(z -600/11).

Which

---------------

 simplifies to:

BD²=480 + (480*720)/(11*(z -600/11)).

Compute

---------------

 480*720=345600.

So,

BD²=480 + 345600/(11*(z -600/11)).

But

---------------

 z=y²>600/11, so as z increases, the term 345600/(11*(z -600/11)) decreases, approaching zero. Therefore, BD² approaches 480 as z approaches infinity.

On

---------------

 the other hand, as z approaches 600/11 from above, the denominator approaches zero, making the second term go to infinity. So, BD² approaches infinity as z approaches 600/11+.

Therefore, BD² can be made arbitrarily large, but it has a lower bound.

Wait, but the

---------------

 problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, the infimum of BD² is 480, because

---------------

 as z increases, BD² approaches 480 from above.

So, BD² is always greater than 480, but can be made as close to 480 as desired by choosing points

---------------

 A with very large y². Therefore, the infimum is 480.

Hence, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 480.

Wait, but let me double

---------------

-check.

Wait, when z approaches infinity, BD² approaches 480.

But when z approaches 600/11 from above, BD² approaches infinity.

So, BD² can be as large as possible, but the

---------------

 minimal BD² is 480, approached as z increases.

Therefore, BD² is always greater than or equal to 480, but since

---------------

 z can't be infinity, BD² can't actually reach 480. It can only approach it.

Wait, but in

---------------

 reality, since z can be as large as possible, BD² can be as close to 480 as desired, but never less than 480.

Wait, but

---------------

 wait, in the expression BD²=480 + 345600/(11*(z -600/11)), as z increases, the second term becomes

---------------

 smaller, so BD² approaches 480 from above. So, BD² is always greater than 480.

Therefore

---------------

, the infimum of BD² is 480. So, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480.

Wait

---------------

, but hold on. The problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, since

---------------

 BD² can be made as close to 480 as we like, but never less than 480, the greatest number less than all BD² is 480, because any number greater than 480 would not be less than all BD² (since BD² can be 480 + ε for any ε>0).

Wait, no. Wait

---------------

, if the infimum is 480, then for any ε>0, there exists a rhombus with BD² <480 +ε. So, the set of BD² is [480, ∞). So, the greatest number less than all BD² would be 480, because any

---------------

 number less than 480 would not be less than all BD² (since BD² can be larger than 480). Wait, no, that

---------------

's not correct.

Wait, no. Let me clarify.

If BD² can take any value greater than or equal to 480, then the set of BD² is [480, ∞). So, the greatest

---------------

 real number that is less than BD² for all rhombi would be 480, because for any number less than 480, there exists a rhombus with BD² less than that number? No, wait, no.

Wait, no

---------------

. Because BD² is always ≥480, so any number less than 480 would be less than BD² for all rhombi. But the problem asks for the greatest such number. So, the maximum lower bound is 480, since BD² can't be less than 480.

Wait, I

---------------

 think I got confused earlier.

Wait, the set of BD² is [480, ∞). So, the infimum is 480. So, the greatest number that is less than BD² for all rhombi would be 480, because any

---------------

 number greater than 480 is not less than all BD² (since BD² can be 480). So

---------------

, the greatest number that is less than BD² for all rhombi is 480, because for any ε>0, 480 +ε is not less than all BD² (since BD² can be 480).



---------------

Wait, that's correct. Because if you take the number 480, it is less than all BD² except

---------------

 when BD²=480. But the problem says "less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, if there

---------------

 exists a rhombus with BD²=480, then 480 is not less than BD² for that rhombus. Therefore

---------------

, the number must be less than 480.

Wait, but in our earlier analysis, BD² approaches 480 as z approaches infinity. So, BD² can get arbitrarily close to 480, but never actually reaches 480. So, BD² is in (480, ∞).

Wait, so

---------------

 if BD² is always greater than 480, then the infimum is 480, but it's not attained. So, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi would be 480, because BD² is always greater than 480, so 480 is less than all BD². But wait, no

---------------

, because 480 is less than or equal to BD², but the problem says "less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, if BD² can be 480, then 480 is not less than BD² for that rhombus. But in our case, BD² approaches 480 but never actually reaches it. So, BD² is always greater than 480, so 480 is less than all BD².

Wait, but

---------------

 in reality, BD² can be as close to 480 as we want, but not equal to 480. So, the

---------------

 infimum is 480, but it's not attained. Therefore, for any ε>0, there exists a rhombus with BD² <480 +ε, but BD

---------------

² is always greater than 480.

So, the set of BD² is (480, ∞). Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480, because any

---------------

 number greater than 480 would not satisfy being less than BD² for all rhombi (since BD² can be just

---------------

 above 480). So, the maximum lower bound is 480.

Wait, but if BD² is always greater than 480, then 480 is less than all BD². So, 480 is the greatest number with that property.

Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the answer is 480.

But let me double

---------------

-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

We started by parameterizing points A and C as (x,y) and (-x,-y), then points B and D as (t, (-x/y)t) and (-t, (x/y)t). We substituted into hyperbola equation, found t² in terms of x and y, then expressed BD² in terms of x and y, then

---------------

 substituted x² from hyperbola equation, and after some algebra, found BD² in terms of y², which we set

---------------

 as z. Then, after simplifying, we found BD²=480 + 345600/(11(z -600/11)). As z increases, BD² approaches 480, but is

---------------

 always greater than 480. So, the infimum is 480, which is the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi.

So, the answer is 480.


To solve the problem, we analyze the rhombus \(ABCD\) inscribed in the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Hyperbola and Rhombus Properties**: The hyperbola is centered at the origin, and the rhombus is symmetric with respect to both axes. The diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular.

2. **Parameter

---------------

ization of Points**: Let point \(A\) be \((x, y)\), so point \(C\) is \((-x, -y)\). The other diagonal \(BD\) lies on a line perpendicular to \(AC\), with slope \(-\frac{x}{y}\). Points \(B\) and \(D\) are \((t, -\frac{x}{y}t)\) and \((-t, \frac{x}{y}t)\).

3. **Substituting into Hyperbola**: Substituting \(B\) and \(D\) into the hyperbola equation gives \(t^2 = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{20} - \frac{x^2}{24y^2}}\). This requires \(\frac{1}{20} - \frac{x^2}{24y^2} > 0\), leading to \(24y^2 - 20x^2 > 0\).

4. **Expressing \(BD^2\)**: The length of diagonal \(BD\) is calculated

---------------

 as \(BD^2 = 4t^2 \left(1 + \frac{x^2}{y^2}\right)\). Using \(x^2 = 20(1 + \frac{y^2}{24})\), we express \(BD^2\) in terms of \(y^2\).

5. **Simplifying**: After substituting and simplifying, \(BD^2\) is found to be \(480 + \frac{345600}{11(y^2 - \frac{600}{11})}\). As \(y^2\) increases, \(BD^2\) approaches 480 from above.

6. **Conclusion**: Since \(BD^2\) can be made arbitrarily close to 480 but never less than it, the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi is 480.

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{480}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
