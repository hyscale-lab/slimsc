Okay, so I've got this problem here with logarithms and three variables: x, y, and z. All of them are positive real numbers. The problem gives me three equations involving logarithms base 2, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x⁴y³z²), which will be a fraction m/n. Then I have to find m + n where m and n are coprime.

Hmm, let's see. The equations are:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

I think the first step is to convert these logarithmic equations into their exponential forms because that might make them easier to handle. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a.

So, for

---------------

 the first equation: log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2 implies that 2^(1/2) = x/(y z). Which

---------------

 is the same as sqrt(2) = x/(y z). So, x = sqrt(2) * y z.

Similarly, for the second equation: log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3 implies

---------------

 2^(1/3) = y/(x z). So, y = 2^(1/3) * x z.

And the third equation: log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4 implies 2^(1/4) = z/(x y). So, z = 2^(1/4) * x y.

Now

---------------

, I have expressions for x, y, and z in terms of the other two variables. Maybe I can substitute these into each other to find a relationship between x, y, and z.

Let me write down the three expressions again:

1. x = sqrt(2) * y z
2. y = 2^(1/3) * x z
3. z = 2^(1/4) * x y

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 I can substitute x from equation 1 into equation 2 and 3.

From equation 1: x = sqrt(2) y z

Substitute x into equation 2: y = 2^(1/3) * (sqrt(2) y z) * z

Simplify that: y = 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2) * y * z²

Let

---------------

 me compute 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2). Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so

---------------

 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2) = 2^(1/3 + 1/2). Let's compute the exponent: 1/3 + 1/2 = (2 + 3)/6 = 5/6. So, 2^(5/6).

So, equation 2 becomes: y = 2^(5/6) * y * z²

Hmm, so

---------------

 we can divide both sides by y (since y is positive, so it's not zero):

1 = 2^(5/6) * z²

Which

---------------

 means z² = 1 / (2^(5/6)) = 2^(-5/6)

Therefore, z = 2^(-5/12) since z

---------------

 is positive. Wait, let me compute that exponent: (-5/6) divided by 2 is (-5/12). So, z = 2^(-5/12).

Wait

---------------

, let me double-check that:

z² = 2^(-5/6), so z = sqrt(2^(-5/6)) = 2^(-5/12). Yes, that's correct.

Okay, so z is found. Now, maybe we can find y.



---------------

From equation 2: y = 2^(1/3) * x z

But I have x in terms of y and z,

---------------

 from equation 1: x = sqrt(2) y z.

So, substitute x into equation 2:

y = 2^(1/3) * (sqrt(2) y z) * z

Simplify that: y = 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2) * y * z²

Wait, that

---------------

's the same as before, which led us to z = 2^(-5/12). So, perhaps I

---------------

 should substitute z into equation 3 to find y or x.

Wait, equation 3 is z = 2^(1/4) * x y.

We

---------------

 know z is 2^(-5/12), so:

2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) * x y

Let

---------------

 me write that as:

x y = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/4) = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3)

So, x y = 2^(-2/3)

From

---------------

 equation 1: x = sqrt(2) y z. We know z is 2^(-5/12), so:



---------------

x = sqrt(2) * y * 2^(-5/12)

Simplify sqrt(2): that's 2^(1/2). So,

x = 2^(1/2) * y * 2^(-5/12) = y * 2^(1/2 - 5/12)

Compute the exponent: 1/2 is 6/12, so 6/12 - 5/12 = 1/12. So,

x = y * 2^(1/12)

So, x = y * 2^(1/12)

Now

---------------

, from equation 3, we have x y = 2^(-2/3)

But since x = y * 2^(1/12), substitute into x y:

(y * 2^(1/12)) * y = 2^(-2/3)

Which is y² * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3)

So, y² = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3 - 1/12)

Convert to twelfths: -2/3 is -8/12, so -8/12 -1/12 = -9/12 = -3/4.

Thus, y² = 2^(-3/4)

So, y = 2^(-3/8) since y is positive.

So

---------------

, y = 2^(-3/8)

Now, from x = y * 2^(1/12):

x = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8 + 1/12)

Compute the exponent: -

---------------

3/8 is -9/24, 1/12 is 2/24. So, -9/24 + 2/24 = -7/24.

Thus, x = 2^(-7/24)

So

---------------

, now we have x, y, z in terms of powers of 2:

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-3/8)

z = 2^(-5/12)

Let

---------------

 me check if these satisfy equation 1: x/(y z)

x = 2^(-7/24)

y z = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-3/8 -5/12)

Convert to 24 denominators: -3/8 is -9/24, -5/12 is -10/24. So, -9/24 -10/24 = -19/24.

Thus, y z = 2^(-19/24)

Then x/(y z) = 2^(-7/24) / 2^(-19/24) = 2^(-7/24 + 19/24) = 2^(12/24) = 2^(1/2) = sqrt(2), which matches equation 1.



---------------

Good, that works.

Similarly, check equation 2: y/(x z)

y = 2^(-3/8)

x z = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-7/24 -10/24) = 2^(-17/24)

So, y/(x z) = 2^(-3/8) / 2^(-17/24) = 2^(-9/24 +17/24) = 2^(8/24) = 2^(1/3), which matches equation 2.

And

---------------

 equation 3: z/(x y)

z = 2^(-5/12)

x y = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-7/24 -9/24) = 2^(-16/24) = 2^(-2/3)

So, z/(x y) = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(-2/3) = 2^(-5/12 + 8/12) = 2^(3/12) = 2^(1/4), which matches equation 3.

All

---------------

 right, so x, y, z are correctly found.

Now, the problem asks for |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|.

Let

---------------

's compute x⁴ y³ z²:

x⁴ = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6)

y³ = (2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8)

z² = (2^(-5/12))^2 = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)

Multiply them all together: 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6)

Add exponents: (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)

Let me compute each term:

-7/6 is equal

---------------

 to -56/48

-9/8 is -54/48

-5/6 is -40/48

Adding them together: (-56 -54 -40)/48 = (-150)/48 = -25/8

Wait, wait

---------------

, let me check:

-7/6 is -56/48

-9/8 is -54/48

-5/6 is -40/48

Sum: (-56 -54 -40) = (-150), over 48.

Simplify -150/48: divide numerator and denominator by 6: -25/8.

So, x⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-25/8)

Therefore

---------------

, log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = log₂(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.

The

---------------

 absolute value of that is | -25/8 | = 25/8.

So, the value is 25/8, where m =25 and n=8. They are coprime because 25 and 8 share no common factors besides 1.

Thus, m + n =25 +8=33.

I think that's the answer. Let me quickly recap to make sure I didn't make any calculation

---------------

 mistakes.

1. Converted each logarithmic equation to exponential form.
2. Expressed x, y, z in terms of each other.
3. Substituted into

---------------

 each other to find z first, then y, then x.
4. Verified that each found value satisfies the original equations.
5. Then, computed x⁴ y³ z² by converting

---------------

 each variable to exponent of 2, added exponents, took log base 2, took absolute value.
6. Ex

---------------

pressed as 25/8, so m + n is 33.

I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, so I think 33 is the correct answer.


Let

---------------

 \( x, y, \) and \( z \) be positive real numbers that satisfy the given system of equations. We start by converting each logarithmic equation into its exponential form:

1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\) implies \( \frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} \), so \( x = \sqrt{2} \cdot yz \).
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\) implies \( \frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3} \), so \( y = 2^{1/3} \cdot xz \).
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\) implies \( \frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4} \), so \( z = 2^{1/4} \cdot xy \).

Substituting \( x = \sqrt{2} \cdot yz \) into the second equation:
\[ y = 2^{1/3} \cdot (\sqrt{2} \cdot yz) \cdot z = 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/2} \cdot y \cdot z^2. \]
Simplifying, we find:
\[ 1 = 2^{5/6} \cdot z^2 \implies z^2 = 2^{-5/6} \implies z = 2^{-5/12}. \]

Next, substituting \( z = 2^{-5/12} \) into the third equation:
\[ 2^{-5/12} = 2^{1/4} \cdot x \cdot y \implies xy = 2^{-5/12 - 3/12} = 2^{-8/12} = 2^{-2/3}. \]

Using \( x = \sqrt{2} \cdot yz \) and substituting \( z = 2^{-5/12} \):
\[ x = 2^{1/2} \cdot y \cdot 2^{-5/12} = y \cdot 2^{-1/12}. \]

Substituting \( x = y \cdot 2^{-1/12} \) into \( xy = 2^{-2/3} \):
\[ y \cdot (y \cdot 2^{-1/12}) = 2^{-2/3} \implies y^2 \cdot 2^{-1/12} = 2^{-2/3} \implies y^2 = 2^{-2/3 + 1/12} = 2^{-7/12} \implies y = 2^{-7/24}. \]

Finally, substituting \( y = 2^{-7/24} \) into \( x = y \cdot 2^{-1/12} \):
\[ x = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-2/24} = 2^{-9/24} = 2^{-3/8}. \]

Now, we compute \( \left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right| \):
\[ x^4 = (2^{-3/8})^4 = 2^{-3/2}, \quad y^3 = (2^{-7/24})^3 = 2^{-7/8}, \quad z^2 = (2^{-5/12})^2 = 2^{-5/6}. \]
\[ x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-3/2} \cdot 2^{-7/8} \cdot 2^{-5/6} = 2^{-25/8}. \]
\[ \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = \log_2(2^{-25/8}) = -\frac{25}{8}. \]
Taking the absolute value, we get \( \frac{25}{8} \). Thus, \( m = 25 \) and \( n = 8 \), so \( m + n = 33 \).
