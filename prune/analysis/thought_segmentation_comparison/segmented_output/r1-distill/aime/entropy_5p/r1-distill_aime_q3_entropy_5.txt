Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game where they take turns removing 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 will

---------------

 result in Bob having a winning strategy, regardless of how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the game mechanics. Each player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens on their turn. So, from

---------------

 any given number of tokens, the next player can choose to reduce it by 1 or 4, right?

I remember that in such games, it's useful to determine

---------------

 the winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite—

---------------

no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, let's try to model this. Let's define P

---------------

(n) as true if the current player can force a win with n tokens, and false otherwise.

The base case would be P(0) = false, because if there are no tokens left, the player can't make a move and thus loses.

Now, for n ≥ 1, the current player can remove 1 token, leading to n-1 tokens for the opponent. Similarly, if n ≥ 4, the player can remove 4 tokens, leading to n-4 tokens for the opponent.

So, the recursive relation

---------------

 would be:
P(n) = not (P(n-1) and P(n-4)) if n >=1 and n >=4 respectively

---------------

.

Wait, actually, more accurately, the current player can win if either removing 1 token leads the opponent to a losing position or removing 4 tokens leads the opponent to a losing position. So, P(n) is true if either P(n-1) is false or P(n-4) is false.

Wait

---------------

, no, let's think again. For the current player to have a winning strategy, at least one of the moves (removing 1 or 4) must leave the opponent in a losing position. So, P(n) is true if either P(n-1) is false or P(n-4) is false.

So

---------------

, P(n) = (not P(n-1)) OR (not P(n-4)).

But wait, that

---------------

's only if n ≥1 and n ≥4, respectively.

Let me formalize this:

- If n == 0: P(n) = false (base

---------------

 case)
- If n == 1: P(n) = not P(0) = true
- If n == 2: P(n) = not P(1) = false (

---------------

since you can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent who can then take it and win)
Wait, no, wait

---------------

. Wait, when n=2, the current player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent. Then the opponent can take that 1 and win. So the

---------------

 current player cannot force a win, so P(2) is false.

Similarly, for n=3: current player takes 1, leaving 2 for opponent, who can't win. So P(3) would be true.



---------------

Wait, let's compute P(n) step by step.

n | P(n)
0 | false
1 | true (can take 1)
2 | can

---------------

 take 1, leaving 1 for opponent, who takes it and wins. So current player can't force a win. So P(2)=false.
3 | current player can take 1, leaving 2 for opponent, who can't win. So P(3)=true.
4 | current player can take 4 and win immediately. So P(4)=true.
5 | current player can take 1, leaving 4 for opponent. Since

---------------

 P(4)=true, opponent can win. Alternatively, take 4, leaving 1 for opponent, who can take it and win. So no

---------------

 matter what current player does, opponent can win. So P(5)=false.
6 | current player can take 1, leaving 5 for opponent, who can't win. So P(6)=true.
7 | current player can take 1, leaving 6 (which is a winning position for opponent). Alternatively, take 4, leaving 3 (which is a winning position for opponent). So both

---------------

 moves lead to opponent winning. So P(7)=false.
8 | current player can take 1, leaving 7 (which is losing for opponent). So P(8)=true.
9 | current player can take 1, leaving 8 (winning for opponent). Or take 4, leaving 5 (losing for opponent). So P

---------------

(9)=true, because the current player can take 4 and leave opponent with 5 (a losing position).
Wait, wait

---------------

, P(9) is true because taking 4 tokens leaves 5, which is a losing position for the opponent. So P

---------------

(9)=true.

Wait, let me make a table step by step to avoid confusion.

Let me list n from 0 to, say, 10, and compute P(n):

n | P(n)
0 | false
1 | true

---------------

 (take 1)
2 | can only take 1, leaving 1 for opponent who wins. So P(2)=false.
3 | take 1, leave 2 (which is losing for opponent). So P(3)=true.
4 | take 4 and win. So P(4)=true.
5 | options

---------------

:
   - take 1, leave 4 (opponent can take 4 and win)
   - take 4, leave 1 (opponent takes 1 and wins)
   So P

---------------

(5)=false.
6 | take 1, leave 5 (which is losing for opponent). So P(6)=true.
7 | options:
   - take 1, leave 6 (opponent can win)
   - take 4, leave 3 (opponent can win)
   So P(7)=false.
8 | take 1, leave 7 (opponent can't win). So P(8)=true.
9 | options:
   - take 1, leave 8 (opponent can win)
   - take 4, leave 5 (opponent can't win)
   So P(9)=true because taking

---------------

 4 leaves opponent in losing position.
10| options:
   - take 1, leave 9 (opponent can win)
   - take 4, leave 6 (opponent can win)
   So P(10)=false.



---------------

Hmm, interesting. So the pattern so far is:

n : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
P(n): F T F T T F T F T T F

Wait, that

---------------

's from n=0 to n=10.

Wait, maybe looking for a pattern here.

Let me see the positions

---------------

 where P(n) is false, i.e., losing positions. From the above, n=0,2,5,7,10 are losing positions.

Wait

---------------

, 0,2,5,7,10: the differences between them are 2,3,2,3.



---------------

So, 0, +2=2, +3=5, +2=7, +3=10, +

---------------

2=12, +3=15, etc. So perhaps the losing positions follow a cycle of adding 2 and 3 alternately.

Wait

---------------

, but let's see if this pattern continues beyond n=10.

Compute P(11):

n=11:

---------------

 current player can take 1, leaving 10 (which is a losing position for opponent). So P(11)=true.

n=12: take

---------------

 4, leaving 8, which is a winning position for opponent. Or take 1, leaving 11 (opponent can win). So P

---------------

(12)=false.

Wait, because if the current player takes 1 from 12, leaving 11, which is a winning position for the opponent. Alternatively

---------------

, taking 4 from 12 leaves 8, which is a winning position for the opponent. So P(12)=false.

So

---------------

 n=12 is a losing position.

Similarly, n=13: take 1, leaving 12 (losing for opponent). So P(13)=true.

n=14: take 4, leaving 10 (losing for opponent). So P(14)=true.

n=15: options

---------------

:
- take 1, leaving 14 (opponent can win)
- take 4, leaving 11 (opponent can win)
So P(15)=false.

So the

---------------

 losing positions up to n=15 are 0,2,5,7,10,12,15.

Wait

---------------

, so 0,2,5,7,10,12,15.

The differences between consecutive losing positions:

---------------

 2,3,2,3,2,3.

So it's a repeating pattern of adding 2 and 3 alternately.

So the

---------------

 losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 mod 5? Wait, let's see:

Wait, 0: 0 mod 5=0

2: 2 mod5=2

5: 0 mod5=0

7: 2 mod5=2

10: 0 mod5=0

12: 2 mod5=2

15: 0 mod5=0

Hmm, so

---------------

 it's alternating between 0 and 2 mod5.

Wait, but wait, 5 is 0 mod5, 7 is 2 mod5, 10 is 0, 12 is 2, 15 is 0, etc.

So the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5? But

---------------

 wait, 5 is 0 mod5, 7 is 2 mod5, 10 is 0, 12 is 2, 15 is 0, etc.

So,

---------------

 perhaps the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5, but starting from n=0, 

---------------

2, 5,7,10,12,15,17, etc.

Wait, but let

---------------

's check n=17:

n=17: can take 1, leaving 16. P(16) would be?



---------------

Wait, I didn't compute up to 17. Let's compute P(16):

n=16: options

---------------

:
- take 1, leaving 15 (losing position for opponent). So P(16)=true.

n=17: take 1, leaving 16 (opponent can win). Take 4, leaving 13 (opponent can win). So P(17)=false.

So n=17 is a losing position. 17 mod5 is 2. So yes, the

---------------

 losing positions are 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20, etc.

So the losing positions are numbers where n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Wait, but

---------------

 let me confirm with n=20:

n=20: take 1, leaves 19. P(19): let

---------------

's compute P(18) and P(19).

n=16: true

n=17: false

n=18: take 1, leaves 17 (losing for opponent), so P(18)=true.

n=19: take 1, leaves 18 (opponent can win). Take4, leaves 15 (opponent can't win). So P(19)=true, because taking 4 leaves opponent with 15 (losing).

n=20: take 4, leaves 16 (opponent can win). Or take 1, leaves 19 (opponent can win). So P(20)=false.

Yes, so n=20 is a losing position, and 20 mod5=0.

So the losing positions are n

---------------

 ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Wait, but wait, let's check n=22:

n=22: take

---------------

 1, leaves 21. Let's compute P(21):

n=21: take 1, leaves 20 (losing for opponent). So P(21)=true.

n=22: take 1, leaves 21 (opponent can win). Take4, leaves 18 (opponent can win). So P(22)=false.

22 mod5=2, which fits the pattern.

So it

---------------

 seems that the losing positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

But wait, let's check n=25:

n=25: take 1, leaves 24. Let

---------------

's compute P(24):

n=24: take 1, leaves 23. Let's compute P(23):

n=23: take 1, leaves 22 (losing), so P(23)=true.

n=24: take 1, leaves 23 (opponent can win). Take4, leaves 20 (losing). So P(24)=true because taking 4 leaves opponent at 20 (losing).

n=25: take 1, leaves 24 (opponent can win). Take4, leaves 21 (opponent can win). So P(25)=false.

25 mod5=0, which fits the losing position.

So the

---------------

 losing positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Therefore, for these values of n, the current player cannot force a win, meaning the opponent can force a win.

But wait, in the problem statement, Alice goes first. So if n is a losing position, Alice cannot force a win, so Bob can.

Therefore, the number of n ≤2024 where n ≡0 or 2 mod5 is the answer.

So we

---------------

 need to count the numbers ≤2024 where n mod5 is 0 or 2.

How many such numbers are there?

Let

---------------

 me compute.

First, for n mod5=0: numbers are 5,10,15,..., up to the maximum ≤2024.

Similarly for n mod5=2: 2,7,12,17,... up to ≤2024.

Compute

---------------

 how many terms are in each sequence.

For mod5=0:

The first term is 5, last term ≤2024 is the largest multiple of 5 ≤2024.

2024 ÷5=404.8, so 404×5=2020.

So number of terms is 2020/5=404. But wait, 

---------------

5×404=2020, which is the 404th term starting from 5.

---------------

 Wait, but the number of terms is 404 because 5×1=5, 5×2=10, ..., 5×404=2020.

Similarly, for mod5=2:

The first term is 2, next is 7=5×1+2, 12=5×2+2, etc.

The last term ≤2024: Let's compute 2024 ÷5=404.8, so 5×404=2020. Then 2020+2=2022, which is ≤2024. So the last term is 2022.

The number of terms in this sequence is 

---------------

405 because starting from 2, each term is 5k+2 where k starts at 0: 5×0+2=2, 5×1+2=7, ..., 5×404 +2=2022. So k

---------------

 ranges from 0 to 404, which is 405 terms.

Wait, wait: Let's see

---------------

. The number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is given by ((last - first)/common difference) +1.

For mod5=0: first=5, last=2020, common difference 5.

Number of terms: ((2020-5)/5)+1 = (2015/5)+1 = 403 +1=404.

For mod5=2: first=2, last=2022, common difference 5.

Number of terms: ((2022-2)/5)+1 = (2020/5)+1=404 +1=405.

So total losing positions are

---------------

 404 (for 0 mod5) +405 (for 2 mod5) =809.

Wait, but let's confirm

---------------

 whether 2022 is indeed ≤2024. Yes, it's 2022, which is less than 2024.

But

---------------

 wait, is 2024 included? Let's check 2024 mod5: 2024 ÷5 is 404×5=2020, remainder 4. So 2024 mod5=4. So 2024 is not a losing position.

So the total

---------------

 number is 404+405=809.

Wait, but let me double-check the counts.

For mod5=0:

Numbers

---------------

 are 5,10,15,...,2020.

Number of terms: (2020 -5)/5 +1= (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404.

Yes.

For mod5=2:

Numbers are 2,7,12,...,2022.

Number of terms: (2022-2)/5 +1=2020/5 +1=404 +1=405.

Yes.

So total is 404+405=809.

Therefore, the answer is 809.

Wait, but wait a

---------------

 minute. Let me check for n=0. But in the problem statement, n is a positive integer, so n starts at 1. So n

---------------

=0 is not counted.

In our earlier analysis, P(0)=false, but n=0 isn't part of the problem. So for

---------------

 n=1 to 2024, how many are losing positions?

The losing positions in this range are n ≡0 or 2 mod5, but

---------------

 n≥1.

So for mod5=0, the first n is 5, then 10, etc., up to 2020.

As

---------------

 computed, 404 terms.

For mod5=2, the first n is 2, then 7, 12, etc., up to 2022.

As

---------------

 computed, 405 terms.

So total is 404+405=809.

Yes

---------------

, that's correct.

So the number of positive integers n ≤2024 where Bob can guarantee a win is 809.


To determine the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) where Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game's winning and losing positions. A losing position is one where the current player cannot force a win, regardless of the opponent's moves. 

We observe

---------------

 that the losing positions follow a pattern where \( n \equiv 0 \) or \( 2 \pmod{5} \). This means that

---------------

 for \( n \) congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5, the current player cannot force a win. Since Alice goes first, these positions are winning for Bob.

To count the number of such \( n \) up to 2024:
1. **For \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \):** The sequence starts at 5 and ends at 2020. The number of terms is \( \frac{2020 - 5}{5} + 1 = 404 \).
2. **For \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \):** The sequence starts at 2 and ends at 2022. The number of terms is \( \frac{2022 - 2}{5} + 1 = 405 \).

Adding these, the total number of losing positions is \( 404 + 405 = 809 \).

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) where Bob can guarantee a win is \(\boxed{809}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
