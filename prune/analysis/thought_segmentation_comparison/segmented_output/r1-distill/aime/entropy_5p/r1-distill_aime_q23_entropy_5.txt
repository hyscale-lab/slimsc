Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

The problem says: We have a list of positive integers with three properties.

1. The sum of all the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9. That means 9 appears more times than any other number, and no other number shares this mode.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself.

And the question is asking for the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to figure

---------------

 out what the list looks like based on these constraints.

Starting with the mode: the unique mode is 9. So 9 has to appear more times than any other number. Since

---------------

 it's the unique mode, no other number can appear the same number of times as 9. So if 9 appears twice, no other number can appear twice or more. Wait

---------------

, no—if 9 appears three times, others can appear up to two times.

But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let's consider the possible

---------------

 lengths of the list.

The sum is 30. So the list has to consist of numbers that add up to 30. Also

---------------

, the median is a positive integer not in the list. Hmm, that's interesting. So the median is some integer, say m, which isn't in the list, but it's the median.

Wait

---------------

, the median is the middle number when the list is ordered. So if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If it's even, it's the average of the two middle numbers.

But the median here

---------------

 is a positive integer not in the list. So that tells me that the list can't have an even number of elements because

---------------

 if it's even, the median would be the average of two numbers. For that average to be an integer not in the list, those

---------------

 two middle numbers must add up to an even number, and their average is m, which is not in the list. Wait

---------------

, but the average of two integers is an integer only if both are even or both are odd. So that's possible.

But let

---------------

's think about whether the list is odd or even length. Because the median is a positive integer not present in the list, that

---------------

 might influence the structure.

Wait, let's consider both cases.

Case 1: The list has an odd number of elements. Then the median is the middle element, which is an

---------------

 integer, and it's not in the list. But wait, if the median is the middle element, how can it not be in the list? Because the list is ordered

---------------

, the middle element must be in the list. So that's a contradiction. So the list can't have an odd number of elements. Therefore, the list must have an even number of elements.

So

---------------

 the list has even length, say 2k elements. Then the median is the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th elements. So

---------------

 for the median to be an integer not present in the list, the two middle numbers must add up to 2m, where m is the median, and m is not in the list.

So

---------------

, for example, if the two middle numbers are a and b, then (a + b)/2 = m, which

---------------

 is an integer. So a + b = 2m. And m is not in the list.

Also, since the list is of

---------------

 positive integers, the numbers are in non-decreasing order.

Now, the mode is 9, unique. So 9 appears more times than any other number. Let's think

---------------

 about how many 9s there are.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Determine the length of the list, which is even.


---------------

2. Find the number of 9s such that 9 is the unique mode.
3. Ensure the median is an integer not in the list, so the two middle numbers must average to it

---------------

, and that integer isn't present elsewhere.
4. The sum of all numbers is 30.

Let me try to find

---------------

 possible lengths. Since the sum is 30, and all numbers are positive integers, the minimum number of elements is 30 (if all are 1), but that

---------------

's probably not the case here.

But considering the median and the mode, the list is likely to have a reasonable number of elements, maybe

---------------

 around 8 or so.

Wait, let's think about the minimal number of 9s required for it to be the unique mode.

Suppose the list has n elements. The

---------------

 mode is 9, which must appear more frequently than any other number.

So, if another number appears k times, 9 must appear at least k+1 times.

Since

---------------

 the numbers are positive integers, other numbers can be 1, 2, etc.

Let me try to find a possible list.

Since

---------------

 the median isn't in the list, the two middle numbers must be such that their average is an integer not in the list. Let's denote

---------------

 the two middle numbers as a and b, with a ≤ b. Then, (a + b)/2 = m, so

---------------

 a + b = 2m, and m is not in the list.

Also, the list is ordered, so all numbers before a are ≤ a, and all after b are ≥ b.

Also

---------------

, since 9 is the mode, it's likely that 9 appears several times.

Let me try to construct such a list.

Let me consider

---------------

 the list length as even, say 8 elements. Then the median is the average of the 4th and 5th elements.

So

---------------

, positions 1 to 8.

Suppose the 4th and 5th elements are a and b, such

---------------

 that (a + b)/2 = m, which is not in the list.

Let me try to set m to a

---------------

 value not present in the list.

Let me also try to have 9 appear at least twice, but to be the mode, it

---------------

 must appear more than any other number.

Wait, suppose 9 appears three times. Then no other number can appear three times or more.

Let

---------------

 me try to construct the list.

Suppose the list has 8 elements.

So, positions 1 to 8.

We

---------------

 need the sum to be 30.

Let me think about the numbers:

We can have several 9s, but

---------------

 let's see.

Wait, if 9 is the mode, it must appear more than any other number. So if 

---------------

9 appears three times, others can appear at most two times.

Let me try to make a list where 9 appears three times.

Let

---------------

 me arrange the list in non-decreasing order.

So, positions 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

Let

---------------

 me place the 9s in positions 5,6,7. So the list would be [x1, x2, x3, x4, 9,9,9, x8].

Wait, but then

---------------

 the median would be (x4 +9)/2. Because the 4th and 5th elements are x4 and 9.

So, (x4 +9)/2 must be an integer m, which is not in the list.

So, x4 +9 must be even, so x4 must be odd because

---------------

 9 is odd. So x4 is odd.

So m = (x4 +9)/2.

Since m is not in the list, it

---------------

 can't be x1, x2, x3, x4, 9, or x8.

Wait, but m

---------------

 is an integer, so x4 must be such that (x4 +9) is even. So x4 must be odd.

So, x

---------------

4 could be 1,3,5,7, etc.

But since the list is non-decreasing, x4 ≤ x5=9.

So x4 can be at

---------------

 most 9, but since it's before 9, it's less than or equal to 9.

Let me try x4=7.

Then m=(7+9)/2=16/2=8.

So m=8. Is

---------------

 8 in the list? No, because the list so far is [x1,x2,x3,7,9,9,9,x8]. So 8 is not present, which satisfies the condition.

So that

---------------

's a possibility.

Now, let's build the list.

We have:

x1 ≤ x2 ≤ x3 ≤7 ≤9 ≤9 ≤9 ≤x8.

The

---------------

 sum is 30.

So, x1 +x2 +x3 +7 +9 +9 +9 +x8 =30.

Calcul

---------------

ating the sum of known elements: 7+9+9+9=34? Wait, 7+9 is 16, plus two more 9s: 16+9=25, 25+9=34. Wait, but that's already

---------------

 34, but the total sum is 30. That can't be. So this is a problem.

So 

---------------

34 is more than 30, which is impossible. So this arrangement can't work.

Hmm, so perhaps 

---------------

9 appears fewer times? Or the list is shorter?

Wait, maybe the list has 6 elements. Let me try that.

If

---------------

 the list has 6 elements, the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th elements.

So, positions

---------------

 1-6.

Let me arrange the list as [x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6].

We

---------------

 need 9 to be the mode, so it has to appear more than any other number. So if 9 appears twice, others can appear at most once. Or if 9 appears three times, others can appear up to two times.

But let's see.

Let

---------------

 me try to have 9 appear three times.

So, positions 3,4,5 are 9,9,9.

Wait, but then the median would be (9+9)/2=9, which is in the list. But the problem says the median is not in the list. So that's a problem.

So,

---------------

 9 can't be in the middle. So if 9 appears three times, perhaps they are in positions 4,5,6. Then the list would be [x1,x2,x3,9,9,9].

The

---------------

 median is (x3 +9)/2.

This median must be an integer not in the list.

So, (x3 +9) must be even, so x3 must be odd.

Let

---------------

's set x3=7.

Then median is (7+9)/2=8, which is not in the list.

So the

---------------

 list would be [x1,x2,7,9,9,9].

Sum is x1+x2+7+9+9+9= x1+x2 +34=30.

But 34 is already more than 30. So that's impossible.

So,

---------------

 perhaps 9 appears only twice.

Wait, but then the mode is 9, so other numbers can appear at most once.

Wait, but if 9 appears twice, and

---------------

 others appear once, then the mode is 9, but it's not unique if another number also appears twice.

Wait, no,

---------------

 because the problem says the unique mode is 9, so no other number can appear twice or more.

So if 9 appears twice, others can appear at most once.

Let me try that

---------------

.

List length 6.

Let me have two 9s, and the rest are unique numbers.

So, list is [x1,x2,x3,x4,x5,x6], with two 9s, and the rest four

---------------

 numbers are unique.

The sum is 30.

Also, the median is (x3 +x4)/2, which is an integer not in the list.

Let me try

---------------

 to arrange the list so that the two 9s are in positions 4 and 5.

So the list is [x1,x2,x3,9,9,x6].

Sum

---------------

: x1 +x2 +x3 +9 +9 +x6= x1+x2+x3+x6 +18=30 → x1+x2+x3+x6=12.

Now

---------------

, the median is (x3 +9)/2 = m, which is not in the list.

So, x3 must be such that x3 +9 is even. So x3 is odd.

Possible x3: 1,3,5,7.

But since the list is non-decreasing, x3 ≤9.

Let's try x3=5.

Then m=(5+9)/2=7.

So

---------------

 m=7, which must not be in the list.

But in the list, x3=5, x4=9, so 7 is not present. Good.

Now, the sum x1+x2+5 +x6=12-5=7?

---------------

 Wait, no, wait: x1+x2+x3+x6=12.

Wait, x3 is 5, so x1 +x2 +5 +x6=12 → x1+x2 +x6=7.

Since

---------------

 x1 ≤x2 ≤5 and x6 ≥9.

Wait, x6 has to be ≥9 because it's after 9 in the list.

So x6 is at least 9.

But x1, x2, x6 are positive integers.

So x6 is at least 9.

So x1 +x2 +9 ≤ x1 +x2 +x6=7.



---------------

But x1 +x2 +9 ≤7 → 9 ≤7, which is impossible.

So x3=5 is too big.

Let me try x3=3.

Then m=(3+9)/2=6, which is not in the list.

So,

---------------

 x1+x2+3 +x6=12 → x1+x2 +x6=9.

x6 must be ≥9.

So x6=9.



---------------

Then x1+x2=0, but x1 and x2 are positive integers. So x1 and x2 can't be zero. So x

---------------

6=9, x1+x2=0 → impossible.

Wait, no, x1 and x2 are at least 1 each. So x1 +x2 ≥2.

So x1 +x2 +x6=9 → x6=9 - (x1 +x2). But x6 has to be ≥9.

So 9 - (x1 +x2) ≥9 → x1 +x2 ≤0. But x1 and x2 are positive integers, so this

---------------

 is impossible.

So x3=3 is not possible.

Next, x3=1.

Then m=(1+9)/2=5, which is not in the list.

Sum: x1 +x2 +1 +x6=12 → x1 +x2 +x6=11.

x6 ≥9.

So possible x6=9,

---------------

 then x1 +x2=2.

Possible only if x1=1 and x2=1.

So the list would be [1,1,1,9,9,9].

Wait, but then

---------------

 9 appears three times, 1 appears three times. So the mode is both 1 and 9, which contradicts the unique mode being 9.

So that's not acceptable.

Alternatively, x6=10, then x1+x2=11-10=1. But x1 and x2 are positive integers, so x

---------------

1=1 and x2=0, which is impossible because they must be positive.

So x6 can't be 10.

Wait

---------------

, x6=9, x1+x2=2: x1=1, x2=1.

So the list would be [1,1,1,9,9,9]. But as

---------------

 I said, modes are 1 and 9, which is a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps x3=7.

Wait, earlier

---------------

 I tried x3=7 and the sum became too big.

Wait, let's recalculate.

If x3=7, then x

---------------

1 +x2 +7 +x6=12 → x1 +x2 +x6=5.

But x6 must be ≥9, so x6=9.



---------------

Then x1 +x2=5-9= -4, which is impossible.

So x3=7 is not

---------------

 possible.

Hmm, maybe the list length is 8.

Wait, earlier I tried 8 elements with x4=7, but the sum was too big.

Wait, let me try a

---------------

 different approach.

Let me consider that the list has 8 elements, and 9 appears three times.

So the list is [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h], with

---------------

 a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d ≤ e ≤ f ≤ g ≤ h.

We need 9 to be the mode, so it appears more times than any other number.

Let's say 9 appears three times.

Then, the other numbers can appear at most two times.

But to

---------------

 make 9 the unique mode, no other number can appear three or more times.

So, let's place the 9s in positions 6,7,8.

So, e

---------------

, f, g, h are 9,9,9, something.

Wait, no, let's think about the

---------------

 median.

In a list of 8 elements, the median is (d + e)/2.

We want this to be an integer m not in the list.

So, d + e must be even.

Also, m is

---------------

 not present in the list.

Let me try to set d and e such that their average is an integer not in the list.

Let me assume

---------------

 that the two middle numbers are 8 and 10.

Then, (8 +10)/2=9, which is in the list because

---------------

 we have 9s. So that's bad.

Alternatively, let me set d=8 and e=10. Then m=9, which is in the list. Not allowed.

Alternatively

---------------

, d=7 and e=9. Then m=8, which is not in the list.

So the list would have d=7 and e=9.

So, the list would be [a, b, c,7,9, f, g, h].

We

---------------

 need to have three 9s. So perhaps f, g, h are 9,9,9.

So the list becomes [a, b, c,7,9,9,9,9].

Wait, but then 9 appears four times, which is more than the

---------------

 initial assumption of three. But that's okay; as long as 9 is the unique mode.

Now, the sum is a + b + c +7 +9 +9 +9 +9= a + b + c + 34=30 → a + b + c= -4. Impossible.

So that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the

---------------

 9s are in positions 5,6,7,8. So four 9s.

Then the list is [a, b, c, d,9,9,9,9].

Sum: a +b +c +d +9+9+9+9= a +b +c +d +36=30 → a +b +c +d= -6. Impossible.

So that's not working.

Alternative

---------------

 approach: Maybe the list has 6 elements, and 9 appears twice.

Wait, earlier that didn't work because the sum was too big.

Wait, let's try again

---------------

.

List length 6.

Two 9s.

Sum is 30.

So, sum of the rest four numbers is 30 - 18=12.

We

---------------

 need to arrange these four numbers such that the median is an integer not in the list.

So, the list is [a, b, c, d,9,9], but

---------------

 wait, no, the 9s have to be in the correct positions.

Wait, in a sorted list, the 9s would be at the end.

So, [

---------------

a, b, c, d, e, f], sorted.

If 9 is the mode, appearing twice, others can appear at most once.

So, two

---------------

 9s, and the rest four numbers are unique.

Sum is a +b +c +d +9 +9=30 → a +b +c +d=12.

Median is (c +d)/2=m, which is integer not in the list.

So, c +d must be even.

Let me try to set c=5, d=5.

Then,

---------------

 (5+5)/2=5, which is in the list. Not allowed.

So c and d can't both be 5.

Alternatively

---------------

, c=4, d=6. Then m=(4+6)/2=5, not in the list.

Sum a +b +4 +6=12 → a +b=2.

Possible:

---------------

 a=1, b=1.

So the list would be [1,1,4,6,9,9].

But then 1 appears twice, and 9 appears twice. So the mode is both 1 and 9. Not allowed,

---------------

 since the mode must be unique.

So that's a problem.

Alternatively, c=3, d=5. Then m=(3+5)/2=4, not in the list.

Sum a +b +3 +5=12 → a +b=4.

Possible: a=1, b=3. Then the list is [1,3,3,5,9,9]. Wait, but 3 appears twice, which ties with 9. So mode is both 3 and 9. Not allowed.

Alternatively, a=2, b=2. Then the list is [2,2,3,5,9,9]. Mode is 2 and 9, which is again

---------------

 a problem.

Hmm, tricky.

Alternatively, c=2, d=6. Then m=(2+6)/2=4, not in the list.

Sum a +b +2 +6=12 → a +b=4.

Possible a=1, b=3: list [1,3,2,6,9,9]. Wait, but the

---------------

 list must be sorted. So correct order is [1,2,3,6,9,9].

But then 1,2,3,6,9,9.

So

---------------

 the numbers are 1,2,3,6,9,9.

Sum is 1+2+3+6+9+9=30. Yes.

Now, the mode is 9, appearing twice. But

---------------

 1 appears once, 2 once, 3 once, 6 once. So 9 is the unique mode. Good.

Median is (3 +6)/2=4.5, which is not an integer. So that's a problem because the median has to be an integer.

Wait, no

---------------

, the problem says the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So if the median is 4.5, that's not an integer, so it's invalid.

So this arrangement doesn't work.

Alternatively

---------------

, c=2, d=4. Then m=(2+4)/2=3, which is in the list. Not allowed.

Alternatively

---------------

, c=4, d=4. Then m=4, which is in the list. Not allowed.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 c=1, d=7. Then m=(1+7)/2=4, which is not in the list.

Sum a +b +1 +7=12 → a +b=4.

Possible a=1, b=3: list [1,3,1,7,9,9]. Wait, but sorted,

---------------

 it's [1,1,3,7,9,9]. Then 1 appears twice, 9 appears twice. Mode is both 1 and 9. Not allowed.

Alternatively, a=2, b=2: list [2,2,1,7,9,9]. Sorted: [1,2,2,7,9,9]. Mode is 2 and 9. Not allowed.

Alternatively, a=1, b=3: same

---------------

 as before.

Hmm, not working.

Wait, perhaps c=3, d=3. Then m=3, which is in the list. Not allowed.

Alternatively, c=5, d=5. Then m=5, which is in the list.

Wait

---------------

, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that the two middle numbers add up to an even number, and

---------------

 their average is m, not in the list.

Let me try to have the two middle numbers as 8 and 10. Then m=9, which is in the list. Not allowed.

Alternatively, 7 and 9: m=8, not in the list.

So if

---------------

 the two middle numbers are 7 and 9, then the median is 8.

So the list would have 7 and 9 as the two middle numbers.

Let me try to

---------------

 construct such a list.

Suppose the list has 6 elements.

So the list is [a, b,7,9,c,d].

Wait, but it

---------------

's sorted, so c and d must be ≥9.

Wait, no, in a sorted list, the two middle numbers are the 3rd and 4th elements.

So,

---------------

 the list is [a, b, c, d, e, f], sorted.

If the 3rd and 4th elements are 7 and 9, then the median is (7+9)/2=8, which is not in the list.

So the list would be [a, b,7,9,e,f], with e and f ≥9.

Now

---------------

, the sum is a +b +7 +9 +e +f=30 → a +b +e +f=14.

We need to have 9 as the unique mode.

So 9 must appear more times than any other number.

Currently

---------------

, 9 appears once. So to be the mode, 9 must appear more than any other number.

So, perhaps

---------------

 9 appears three times.

So, e=9, f=9. Then 9 appears three times.

So the list is [a, b,7,9,9,9].

Sum: a +b +7 +9 +9 +9= a +b +34=30 → a +b= -4. Impossible.

So that's not possible.

Alternatively, 9 appears twice. Then no

---------------

 other number can appear twice.

So, e=9, f= something else.

Wait, but then 9 appears twice, and others

---------------

 can appear once.

So the list is [a, b,7,9,9,f], where f ≥9.

Sum: a +b +7 +9 +9 +f= a +b +f +25=30 → a +b +f=5.

But a and b are ≤7, and f ≥9.

So a +b ≤7 +7=14, but a

---------------

 +b +f=5.

Since f ≥9, a +b=5 -f ≤5 -9= -4. Impossible.

So that's not working.

Hmm, maybe the list has 8 elements.

Let me try 8 elements.

Median

---------------

 is the average of 4th and 5th elements.

Suppose the 4th and 5th elements are 7 and 9. Then median is 8, not in the list.

So the list is [a, b, c,7,9,d,e,f].

Sum

---------------

 is a +b +c +7 +9 +d +e +f=30 → a +b +c +d +e +f=14.

Now, 9 is the mode, so it must appear more times than any other number.

Currently, 9 appears once. So to be the mode, it needs to appear at least twice.

So let's have another 9.



---------------

So, d=9. Then the list is [a,b,c,7,9,9,e,f].

Sum: a +b +c +7 +9 +9 +e +f= a +b +c +e +f +25=30 → a +b +c +e +f=5.

But e and f must be ≥9.

So e and f are at least 9 each.

So e +f ≥18.

But a +b +c +e +f=5 → a +b +c=5 - (e +f) ≤5 -18= -13. Impossible.

So that's not working.

Alternatively, perhaps 9 appears three times.

So, d=9, e=9, f=9.

Then the list is [a, b, c,7,9,9,9,9].

Sum: a +b +c +7 +9 +9 +9 +9= a +b +c +34=30 → a +b +c= -4. Impossible.

So that's not possible.

Hmm, maybe the list has 10 elements. Let's try that.

Wait, but

---------------

 the sum is 30. If the list has 10 elements, the average is 3, but with some

---------------

 numbers being 9.

Wait, but let's see.

Wait, 10 elements would have a median of (5th +6th)/2.

Let

---------------

 me try to have the 5th and 6th elements as 7 and 9. Then median is 8, not in the list.

So the list is [a, b, c, d,7,9,e,f,g,h].

Sum is a +b +c +d +7 +9 +e +f +g +h=30 → a +b +c +d +e +f +g +h=14.

Now, 9 is the mode, so it must appear more than any other number.

Currently, 9 appears once. So let

---------------

's have two 9s.

So, e=9, f=9.

Now, the list is [a, b, c, d,7,9,9,9,g,h].

Wait, but that

---------------

's three 9s. Wait, no, e=9, f=9, and the 6th element is 9.



---------------

Wait, no, the 6th element is 9, and e and f are 9 and 9.

Wait, the

---------------

 list is [a,b,c,d,7,9,9,9,g,h].

But then 9 appears four times,

---------------

 which is more than any other number.

Sum is a +b +c +d +7 +9 +9 +9 +g +h= a +b +c +d +g +h +34=30 → a +b +c +d +g +h= -4. Impossible.

So that's not working.

Wait

---------------

, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think differently.

We need the sum of the list to be 30, and 9 is the unique mode. The median is an integer not in the list.

Let me consider that the list has 8

---------------

 elements.

Let me try to have the two middle numbers as 8 and 8. Then the median is 8, which is in the list. Not allowed.

Alternatively, two middle numbers as 7 and 9. Then median is 8, not in the list.

So, the list is [a,b,c,7,9,e,f,g].

Sum is a +b +c +7 +9 +e +f +g=30 → a +b +c +e +f +g=14.

Now, 9 is the mode, so it must appear more times than any other number.

Currently, 9 appears once. So to

---------------

 be the mode, it needs to appear at least twice.

So, let's have e=9.

Now, the list is [a,b,c,7,9,9,f,g].

Sum: a +b +c +7 +9 +9 +f +g= a +b +c +f +g +25=30 → a +b +c +f +g=5.

But f and g must be ≥9.

So f +g ≥18.

Thus, a +b +c=5 - (f +g) ≤5 -18= -13. Impossible.

So that's not working.

Hmm, maybe the list has 4

---------------

 elements.

Wait, let's try that.

List has 4 elements: [a,b,c,d].

Sum is 30.



---------------

Median is (b +c)/2 = m, an integer not in the list.

Also, 9 is the unique mode, so it must appear more times than any other number.

In a list of 4 elements, to be the mode, 9 must appear at least twice.

So, possible

---------------

 arrangements:

Case 1: 9 appears twice. Then the other two numbers can appear at most once.

So, list could be [9,9,x,y], sorted.

Sum: 9+9+x+y=30 → x + y=12.

Median is (9 +x)/2 = m, which must be an integer not in the list.

So, 9 +x must be even → x is odd.

Possible x values: 1,3,5,7, etc., but x ≤9.

Let me try x=5.

Then y=12 -5=7.

So the list is [5,7,9,9]. Wait, no, sorted it

---------------

's [5,7,9,9].

Median is (7 +9)/2=8, which is not in the list. Good.

Now, check the mode: 9 appears twice, others appear once. So 9 is the unique mode. Good.

Sum is 5+7+9+9=30. Perfect.

So the list is [5,7,9,9].

Wait, but wait

---------------

, the median is 8, which is not in the list. Good.

So this seems to satisfy all conditions.

Now

---------------

, the problem asks for the sum of the squares of all the items.

So, 5² +7² +9² +9²=25 +49 +81 +81.

Calculating:

25 +49=74.

74 +81=155.

155 +81=236.

So the sum of squares is 236.

Wait, but let me double-check the list.

List: [5,7,9,9].

Sum:5+7=12, 9+9=18. 12+18=30. Correct.

Mode: 9 appears twice, others once. Correct.

Median: (7+9)/2=8, not in the list. Correct.

Yes, this works.

So the answer is 236.


The list of positive integers has

---------------

 a sum of 30, a unique mode of 9, and a median that is a positive integer not present in the list. To

---------------

 satisfy these conditions, the list must have an even number of elements since the median is an integer not in the list. After testing various possibilities, the list [5, 7, 9, 9] meets all the criteria:

- Sum: \(5 + 7 + 9 + 9 = 30\)
- Mode: 9 appears twice, more than any other number.
- Median: \((7 + 9) / 2 = 8\), which is not in the list.

The sum of the squares of the elements is:

\[
5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236
\]
