Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break

---------------

 this down.

First, the problem is about finding triples (a, b, c) that are nonnegative integers. So, a, b, c can be 0 or any positive integer, but they must add up to 300. The second condition is a bit more complicated:

---------------

 it's a symmetric expression involving squares and products. Let me write that expression out again to see if I can simplify it.

The expression is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Hmm, I

---------------

 notice that each term is a square of one variable multiplied by another. Maybe I can factor this or find a way to express it in terms of the

---------------

 sum a + b + c.

Wait, let's see: a²b + a²c is equal to a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c is b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b is c²(a + b). So, the entire expression can be written as a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b). That's a bit neater.

But since a + b + c = 300, I

---------------

 can express (b + c) as (300 - a), right? Because if a + b + c = 300, then b + c = 300 - a. Similarly, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c. So substituting these into the expression, it becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

So

---------------

 now, the equation is:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, interesting

---------------

. So each term is of the form x²(300 - x), where x is a, b, or c. Let

---------------

 me think about that function f(x) = x²(300 - x). Maybe I can analyze this function to see how

---------------

 it behaves.

Let me compute f(x) for different values of x. For example, when x is 0, f(0) = 0. When x is 100, f(100) = 100²*(300 - 100) = 10,000 * 200 = 2,000,000. Hmm

---------------

, that's a pretty big value. If x is 200, f(200) = 40,000 * 100 = 4,000,000. And

---------------

 if x is 300, f(300) = 90,000 * 0 = 0. So the function f

---------------

(x) starts at 0, increases, reaches a maximum at some point, then decreases back to 0.

Wait, so

---------------

 the function f(x) = x²(300 - x) is a cubic function. Let me find its maximum. To find the maximum, I can take the derivative and

---------------

 set it to zero. But since we're dealing with integers, maybe it's not necessary, but just for understanding the behavior.

So

---------------

, f(x) = x²(300 - x) = 300x² - x³. The derivative f’(x) is 600x - 3x². Setting this equal to zero: 600x - 3x² = 0 => x(600 - 3x) = 0 => x=0 or x=200. So the function has a maximum at x=200. So

---------------

, f(200) is 4,000,000, which is the maximum value of

---------------

 f(x). So the function increases up to x=200, then decreases after that.

Wait, but in our case, since

---------------

 a + b + c = 300, each of a, b, c is at most 300. So,

---------------

 the maximum value any of them can take is 300, but if one is 300, the others are zero, making

---------------

 the sum 300. Let me think about what the sum a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) equals

---------------

 6,000,000.

Since each term can be up to 4,000,000 (if

---------------

 x=200), but when x=200, the term is 4,000,000, so

---------------

 if two variables are 200, that would be 8,000,000, which is more than 6,000,000. So perhaps

---------------

 only one variable can be 200, and the others must be lower.

Wait, but let's think about the

---------------

 possible maximums. Let me consider the case where one variable is 200. Let's say a=200, then b + c=100. Then, the term

---------------

 a²(300 - a) would be 200²*(100) = 40,000 * 100 = 4,000,000. Then, the other terms would be b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c). Since b + c=100, let

---------------

 me let b= k, c=100 -k. Then, the sum becomes k²(300 -k) + (100 -k)^2*(300 - (100 -k)).

Simplify that: k²(300 - k) + (100 -k)^2*(200 +k). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I

---------------

 can compute the value when a=200 and b + c=100.

Let me see if it's possible for the total sum to be 6,000,000. So, if

---------------

 a=200, then the sum is 4,000,000 + [b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c)] = 6,000,000. So, the sum of the other two terms must be 2,000,000.

Now

---------------

, since b and c are nonnegative integers adding up to 100, their possible values are from 0 to 100. Let's see

---------------

 if any pair (b, c) can make b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 2,000,000.

But wait, if

---------------

 b=100, then c=0, and the expression becomes 100²*(200) + 0 = 10,000 * 200 = 2,000,000. Oh! So if a=200, b=100, c=0, then the sum would be 4,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 0 = 6,000,000. So

---------------

 that's a valid solution. Similarly, if a=200, b=0, c=100, that's also a solution.

Wait

---------------

, but are there other possibilities when a=200? Let me check for other values of b and c where b + c=100. Let's say

---------------

 b=50, c=50. Then, the expression becomes 50²*(250) + 50²*(250) = 2500*250 + 2500*250 = 625,000 + 625,000 = 1,250,000. Adding

---------------

 that to the 4,000,000 from a=200 gives 5,250,000, which is less than 6,000,000. So that's not enough.

What if b=99, c=1? Then, 

---------------

99²*(201) + 1²*(299) = (9801 * 201) + (1 * 299). Let me compute that:

9801 * 200 = 1,960,200, plus 9801 =

---------------

 1,960,200 + 9,801 = 1,970,001. Then, 1²*299 = 299. So total is 1,970,001 + 299 = 1,970,300. So that

---------------

's still way less than 2,000,000. So, only when b=100 and c=0 (or vice versa) does the sum reach 2,000,000. So, when

---------------

 a=200, the only possible (b, c) pairs are (100, 0) and (0, 100). So

---------------

 that gives two solutions: (200, 100, 0) and (200, 0, 100). But wait, since

---------------

 the variables are symmetric, maybe other permutations are also possible.

Wait, but wait: in this problem, the variables are symmetric, so any

---------------

 permutation of (200, 100, 0) would be a solution. Let me check that. So

---------------

, (200, 100, 0), (200, 0, 100), (100, 200, 0), (100, 0, 200), (0, 200, 100), and (0, 100, 200) would all be valid

---------------

 solutions, right? Because in each case, one variable is 200, another is 100, and the last is 0.

Wait, but when

---------------

 a=100, then what happens? Let me try a=100. Then, b + c = 200. The

---------------

 expression becomes a²(300 - a) + ... So, a=100, so a²*(200) = 10,000 * 200 = 2,000,000. Then, the sum of b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) must be 6,000,000 - 2,000,000 = 4,000,000.

Now

---------------

, since b + c=200, let me see if any pairs (b, c) can satisfy this. Let

---------------

 me try b=200, c=0. Then, b²*(300 - 200) = 40,000 * 100 = 4,000,000. So

---------------

 that would make the sum 2,000,000 + 4,000,000 + 0 = 6,000,000. So yes, (100, 200, 0) would be a solution, and similarly

---------------

 for other permutations.

Wait, so when a=100, and b=200, c=0, that's a valid solution. Similarly, when

---------------

 a=100, b=0, c=200. So, each of these permutations would give a

---------------

 valid solution.

So, so far, I've identified that the solutions are permutations of (200, 100, 0). How

---------------

 many such permutations are there? Let me count.

In the case where all three numbers are distinct, the number of permutations is 3! = 6. So, for

---------------

 each arrangement where a=200, b=100, c=0, and all permutations, there are 6 solutions. Let

---------------

 me list them:

1. (200, 100, 0)
2. (200, 0, 100)
3. (100, 200, 0)
4. (100, 0, 200)
5. (0, 200, 100)
6. (0, 100, 200)

So, that's 6 solutions so

---------------

 far. Are there any other solutions where the variables are not just permutations of (200, 100, 0)?

Let me consider another

---------------

 possibility. Suppose two variables are 150, and the third is 0. Let's check if that would satisfy the conditions. Let me compute

---------------

 a + b + c = 150 + 150 + 0 = 300, which satisfies the first condition. Now, let's compute the second condition:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Pl

---------------

ugging in a=150, b=150, c=0:

150²*150 + 150²*0 + 150²*150 + 150²*0 + 0²*150 + 0²*150.

So

---------------

, that's (22500 * 150) + 0 + (22500 * 150) + 0 + 0 + 0.

Each

---------------

 term is 22500 * 150 = 3,375,000. So, two of them would

---------------

 be 6,750,000, which is more than 6,000,000. So that's too big. So, that's

---------------

 not a solution.

Alternatively, maybe two variables are 100, and the third is 100. Wait, a

---------------

=100, b=100, c=100. Let's check:

a + b + c = 300, which is good.

Now, the expression:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Each term is 100²*100 = 10,000 * 100 = 1,000,000. There are 6 terms, so 6 * 1,000,000 = 6,000,000. Oh! So (100,100,100) is another solution. So

---------------

 that's another triple. Now, how many permutations of this are there? Since all three are the same, there's only one unique solution here: (100, 100, 100).

So that's another solution. So now, we

---------------

 have 6 + 1 = 7 solutions.

Wait, but is that the only solution where all three variables are equal? Because if

---------------

 a = b = c, then each is 100. So that's the only case where all three are equal.

Now, are there any other solutions where two

---------------

 variables are equal, and the third is different? Let's suppose, for example, that two variables are 150, and the third is 0, but we saw that sum

---------------

 is too big. Alternatively, maybe two variables are 120, and the third is 60, but I'm not sure. Let me try to

---------------

 find another solution.

Alternatively, perhaps one variable is 200, another is 100, and the third is 0, which we've already considered. Or

---------------

 maybe one variable is 200, another is 50, and the third is 50. Let's check if

---------------

 that works.

So, a=200, b=50, c=50.

Sum: 200 +50 +50=300, which is good.

Now, compute the expression:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

a

---------------

²b = 40,000 *50=2,000,000
a²c=40,000 *50=2,000,000
b²a=2500 *200=500,000
b²c=2500*50=125,000
c²a=2500*200=500,000
c²b=2500*50=125,000

Now, adding all these up:

2,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 4,000,000

500,000 + 125,000 = 625,000

500,000 + 125,000 = 625,000

Total sum: 4,000,000 + 625,000 + 625,000 = 5,250,000. That's less than 6,000,000, so that's not a solution.

Hmm, perhaps

---------------

 another approach. Let's think about possible values for a, b, c. Since the function f(x) = x²(300 - x) is

---------------

 involved, and we know that f(200) is 4,000,000, which is the maximum. So, if

---------------

 two variables are 200, then the sum would be 8,000,000, which is more than 6,000,000. So, that

---------------

's impossible.

What about one variable being 200, another 100, and the third 0? We saw that gives

---------------

 exactly 6,000,000. What about another case where one variable is 200, another is,

---------------

 say, 150, and the third is 50. Let's check:

a=200, b=150, c=50.

Sum: 200+150+50=400, which is more than 300. So that's invalid.

Wait, maybe

---------------

 a=150, b=150, c=0. Sum is 300. Let's compute the expression:

a²b = 22500 *150 = 3,375,000
a²c=22500*0=0
b²a=22500*150=3,375,000
b²c=22500*0=0
c²a=0*150=0
c²b=0*150=0

Total sum: 3,375,000 + 0 + 3,375,000 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 6,750,000, which is more than 6,000,000. So that's not a solution.

Alternatively, perhaps

---------------

 a=150, b=100, c=50.

Sum: 150+100+50=300.

Compute the expression:

a²b=22500*100=2,250,000
a²c=22500*50=1,125,000
b²a=10,000*150=1,500,000
b²c=10,000*50=500,000
c²a=2500*150=375,000
c²b=2500*100=250,000

Adding these up:

2,250,000 + 1,125,000 = 3,375,000

1,500,000 + 500,000 = 2,000,000

375,000 + 250,000 = 625,000

Total: 3,375,000 + 2,000,000 = 5,375,000 + 625,000 = 6,000,000.

Wait a minute! That adds up exactly to 6,000,000. So, (150, 100, 50) is another solution. Now

---------------

, that's interesting because it's a different kind of triple, not just a permutation of (200, 100, 0). So, that

---------------

's another solution.

Wait, so how many permutations of this triple are there? Let's see, in (150, 100, 50), all three numbers are distinct, so the number of permutations is 3! = 6. So that's 6 more solutions. Let me list them:

1. (150, 100, 50)
2. (150, 50, 100)
3. (100, 150, 50)
4. (100, 50, 150)
5. (50, 150, 100)
6. (50, 100, 150)

So, that's 6 more solutions. So now, total

---------------

 solutions are 6 (from 200,100,0) + 1 (from 100,100,100) + 6 (from 150,100,50) = 13 solutions. Wait, but is

---------------

 that correct? Let me double-check.

Wait, wait, when I took a=150, b=100, c=50, the

---------------

 sum was 6,000,000, which worked. So that's a valid solution, and all

---------------

 permutations of this would also be valid. So that adds 6 solutions.

But are there more such triples? Let me try another case

---------------

. Suppose a=120, b=120, c=60. Let's check if that works.

Sum: 120+120+60=300, which is good.

Compute the expression:

a²b = 14,400 * 120 = 1,728,000
a²c=14,400 * 60 = 864,000
b²a=14,400 *120=1,728,000
b²c=14,400 *60=864,000
c²a=3,600 *120=432,000
c²b=3,600 *120=432,000

Adding these:

1,728,000 + 864,000 = 2,592,000
1,728,000 + 864,000 = 2,592,000
432,000 + 432,000 = 864,000

Total sum: 2,592,000 + 2,592,000 = 5,184,000 + 864,000 = 6,048,000. That's more than 6,000,000, so that's not a solution.

Hmm, maybe

---------------

 another case. Let me try a=100, b=100, c=100. That's

---------------

 the all-100s case, which we've already considered. Let me try a=180, b=90, c=30.

Sum: 180 +90 +30=300.

Compute the expression:

a²b = 32,400 *90=2,916,000
a²c=32,400 *30=972,000
b²a=8,100 *180=1,458,000
b²c=8,100 *30=243,000
c²a=900 *180=162,000
c²b=900 *90=81,000

Adding them up:

2,916,000 + 972,000 = 3,888,000
1,458,000 + 243,000 = 1,701,000
162,000 + 81,000 = 243,000

Total: 3,888,000 + 1,701,000 = 5,589,000 + 243,000 = 5,832,000. That's less than 6,000,000, so not a solution.

Hmm, maybe another

---------------

 approach. Let me consider that the expression a²b + a²c + ... can be rewritten as ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c). Wait, let

---------------

 me check that.

Wait, a²b + a²c = a²(b + c) = a²(300 - a), as

---------------

 before. So, perhaps it's better to stick with the earlier approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the expression as symmetric

---------------

 and look for solutions where two variables are equal, and the third is different.

So, let's assume that a = b, and then find c such

---------------

 that a + a + c = 300 => 2a + c = 300 => c = 300 - 2a.

Now, the

---------------

 expression becomes:

a²a + a²c + a²a + a²c + c²a + c²a.

Wait, that

---------------

's a bit messy. Wait, let me compute each term:

a²b = a^3, since b = a.
a²c = a²c
b²a = a^3
b²c = a²c
c²a = c²a
c²b = c²a

So, the total expression is a^3 + a²c + a^3 + a²c + c²a + c²a.

S

---------------

implify:

2a^3 + 2a²c + 2c²a.

Factor out 2a:

2a(a² + a c + c²).

But

---------------

 since c = 300 - 2a, let's substitute that in:

2a [a² + a(300 - 2a) + (300 - 2a)^2 ]

Simplify inside the brackets:

a² + 300a - 2a² + (300 - 2a)^2.

Compute

---------------

 (300 - 2a)^2 = 90000 - 1200a + 4a².

So, the

---------------

 expression inside becomes:

a² + 300a - 2a² + 90000 - 1200a + 4a²

Combine like terms:

(a² - 2a² + 4a²) + (300a - 1200a) + 90000

That's (3a²) + (-900a) + 90000.

So, the entire expression is 2a (3a² - 900a + 90000).

Set

---------------

 this equal to 6,000,000:

2a (3a² - 900a + 90000) = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 2a (assuming a ≠ 0):

3a² - 900a + 90000 = 3,000,000 / a.

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let me multiply

---------------

 both sides by a to eliminate the denominator:

3a^3 - 900a^2 + 90,000a = 3,000,000.

Bring all terms to one side:

3a^3 - 900a^2 + 90,000a - 3,000,000 = 0.

Divide through by 3 to simplify:

a^3 - 300a^2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, that

---------------

's a cubic equation. Let me try to find integer roots. The possible rational roots are factors of 1,000,000 divided by factors of 1, so possible roots are ±1, ±2, ..., up to ±1,000,000, which is a lot, but maybe I

---------------

 can find a root by testing some small integers.

Let me try a=100:

100^3 - 300*(100)^2 + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000 = 1,000,000 - 300*10,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000.

Compute each term:

1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0. So, a=100 is a root.

Therefore, we can factor (a - 100) from the cubic equation. Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.

Dividing a^3 - 300a^2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 by (a - 100):

Using synthetic division:

100 | 1   -300    30000    -1000000
          100      -20000      1000000
      --------------------------------
          1    -200     10000         0

So, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a^2 - 200a + 10,000) = 0.

Now, set each factor equal to zero:

a - 100 = 0 => a = 100.

a^2 - 200a + 10,000 = 0. Let's compute discriminant: D = (200)^2 - 4*1*10,000 = 40,000 - 40,000 = 0. So, a

---------------

 = [200 ± 0]/2 = 100.

Thus, the only real root is a=100, with multiplicity two.

So, in

---------------

 the case where a = b, the only solution is a=100, which gives c=300 - 2a=100. So, that

---------------

's the triple (100,100,100), which we've already considered. So, that's the only solution when a = b.

Now

---------------

, are there any other cases where two variables are equal, but not a=100, b=100, c=100? Let me check

---------------

 another case where, say, a = c, and b is different.

So, let me suppose that a = c. Then, a + b + a = 300 => 2a + b = 300 => b = 300 - 2a.

Now, the expression becomes:

a²b + a²a + b²a + b²a + a²a + a²b.

Wait, let

---------------

 me compute each term:

a²b (twice)
a²a = a³ (twice)
b²a (twice)

So, total expression is 2a²b + 2a³ + 2b²a.

Factor out 2a:

2a(a² + a b + b²).

Since

---------------

 b = 300 - 2a, substitute that in:

2a [a² + a(300 - 2a) + (300 - 2a)^2 ].

S

---------------

implify inside the brackets:

a² + 300a - 2a² + (300 - 2a)^2.

Compute (300 - 2a)^2 = 90,000 - 1,200a + 4a².

So, inside the brackets:

a² + 300a - 2a² + 90,000 - 1,200a + 4a².

Combine like terms:

(a² - 2a² + 4a²) + (300a - 1,200a) + 90,000.

Which is 3a² - 900a + 90,000.

So, the entire expression is 2a*(3a² - 900a + 90,000) = 6,000,000.

Div

---------------

ide both sides by 2a (assuming a ≠ 0):

3a² - 900a + 90,000 = 3,000,000 / a.

Multiply both sides by a:

3a^3 - 900a^2 + 90,000a = 3,000,000.

Bring

---------------

 all terms to one side:

3a^3 - 900a^2 + 90,000a - 3,000,000 = 0.

Divide through by 3:

a^3 - 300a^2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0.

Wait, that's the same equation as before. So, the

---------------

 only solution is a=100, which gives b=300 - 2*100=100, c=a=100. So, again, the

---------------

 triple is (100,100,100).

So, in the case where two variables are equal, the only solution is when all three are equal to 100.

Now

---------------

, let's consider the case where all three variables are different. So, a, b, c are all distinct.

Wait

---------------

, but earlier I found that (150,100,50) is a solution. Let me check if that's the only other

---------------

 case or if there are others.

Wait, perhaps I can find another solution by assuming that a=150, b=100, c=50, as before. But

---------------

 let me see if there's a way to find all such possible triples.

Alternatively, perhaps the only solutions are the permutations of (200,100,0) and (150,100,50), plus the triple (100,100,100). Let me see if that's the case.

Wait, let

---------------

 me try another approach. Let me suppose that one of the variables is 100. So, let's set a=100, then b + c = 200.

The

---------------

 expression becomes:

100²*b + 100²*c + b²*100 + b²*c + c²*100 + c²*b.

Which is 10,000*b + 10,000*c + 100b² + 100c² + 100c² + c²*b.

Wait, maybe

---------------

 I should compute it step by step.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to compute it as a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

Since

---------------

 a=100, and b + c=200, then:

a²*(200) = 100²*200 = 10,000*200=2,000,000.

b²*(100 + c) + c²*(100 + b) = b²*(300 - b) + c²*(300 - c), since a=100, so 100 + c = 300 - b, and 100 + b = 300 - c.

Wait, that

---------------

's similar to the earlier substitution. So, the expression becomes:

2,000,000 + [b²*(300 - b) + c²*(300 - c)] = 6,000,000.

Thus, [b²*(300 - b) + c²*(300 - c)] = 4,000,000.

But since b + c = 200, perhaps

---------------

 I can let b = k, c = 200 - k, and then find k such that:

k²*(300 - k) + (200 -k)^2*(300 - (200 -k)) = 4,000,000.

Simplify the second term:

(200 -k)^2*(300 -200 +k) = (200 -k)^2*(100 +k).

So, the equation becomes:

k²*(300 -k) + (200 -k)^2*(100 +k) = 4,000,000.

Let me expand this:

First term: k²*(300 -k) = 300k² -k^3.

Second term: (200 -k)^2*(100 +k). Let's expand (200 -k)^2 = 40,000 -400k +k².

Multiply by (100 +k):

(40,000 -400k +k²)(100 +k) = 40,000*100 +40,000*k -400k*100 -400k*k +k²*100 +k²*k.

Compute each term:

40,000*100 = 4,000,000
40,000*k = 40,000k
-400k*100 = -40,000k
-400k*k = -400k²
k²*100 = 100k²
k²*k =k^3

Now, combine like terms:

4,000,000 + (40,000k -40,000k) + (-400k² + 100k²) +k^3
= 4,000,000 + 0k + (-300k²) +k^3
= 4,000,000 -300k² +k^3.

So, the second term is 4,000,000 -300k² +k^3.

Now, the entire equation becomes:

(300k² -k^3) + (4,000,000 -300k² +k^3) = 4,000,000.

Simplify:

300k² -k^3 +4,000,000 -300k² +k^3 = 4,000,000.

The

---------------

 terms 300k² and -300k² cancel out, and -k^3 +k^3 cancels out. So, we're left with 4,000,000 =4,000,000.

Hmm, that's an identity, which means that for any k, the equation holds as long as a=100, b=k, c=200 -k. Wait, but that can't be right because earlier when I tried a=100, b=100, c=100, the expression was

---------------

 6,000,000, but when I tried a=100, b=150, c=50, it worked as well. So, perhaps

---------------

 for a=100, any b and c that sum to 200 will satisfy the second condition? That seems to

---------------

 be the case from the equation above.

Wait, that's strange because when I tried a=100, b=150, c=50, it worked, but when I tried a=100, b=100, c=100, it also worked. But

---------------

 when I tried a=100, b=120, c=80, it didn't add up to 6,000,000. Wait, but

---------------

 according to this equation, it should.

Wait, no, that can't be. Let me check that again. When I set a=100, and b

---------------

 + c=200, the equation reduces to an identity, which suggests that any such triple would satisfy the condition. But that contradicts my earlier test

---------------

 where a=100, b=120, c=80 didn't add up to 6,000,000. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations

---------------

.

Wait, let me try a=100, b=120, c=80 again.

Compute the expression:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

a

---------------

=100, so:

100²*120 = 10,000 * 120 = 1,200,000
100²*80 = 10,000 *80 = 800,000
b²a = 120² * 100 = 14,400 * 100 = 1,440,000
b²c = 14,400 *80 = 1,152,000
c²a =80² *100 = 6,400 *100 = 640,000
c²b =6,400 *120 = 768,000

Now, sum them up:

1,200,000 + 800,000 = 2,000,000
1,440,000 + 1,152,000 = 2,592,000
640,000 + 768,000 = 1,408,000

Total sum: 2,000,000 + 2,592,000 = 4,592,000 + 1,408,000 = 6,000,000.

Wait, that actually adds up to 6,000,000. So, that

---------------

 triple (100, 120, 80) is also a solution. So, this suggests that when a=100, any b and c that sum to 200 will satisfy the second condition. So, that

---------------

's a whole family of solutions where a=100, and b + c=200, with b and c being any nonnegative integers adding up to 200.

Wait, but then

---------------

 that would mean that there are infinitely many solutions, which can't be right because the problem states that a, b, c are nonnegative integers, but it

---------------

's expecting a finite number of triples. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, no, let me think

---------------

 again. When a=100, then b + c=200, and the expression reduces to 2,000,000 + [b²*(300 - b) + c²*(300 - c)] = 6,000,000. But

---------------

 from earlier substitution, that expression simplifies to an identity, meaning that any b and c summing to 200 would work. So, that

---------------

 suggests that any triple where a=100 and b + c=200 is a solution.

But that can't be correct because when I tried a=100, b=100, c=100, it worked, but when I tried a=100, b=200, c=0, it worked as well. But

---------------

 then, when I tried a=100, b=150, c=50, it worked, and a=100, b=120, c=80, it worked too. So, that

---------------

 suggests that any triple where a=100 and b + c=200 is a solution. So, how many such triples are there?

Well, since

---------------

 a=100, and b + c=200, the number of nonnegative integer solutions is 201 (from b=0 to b=200, with c=200 - b). But wait

---------------

, but the problem is asking for triples (a, b, c), so each of these would be a distinct solution, right

---------------

? But that would mean 201 solutions just from a=100, which is a lot. But earlier

---------------

, I found that (150, 100, 50) is a solution, but in that case, a=150, which is different.

Wait, no

---------------

, in that case, a=150, so that's a different scenario. So, perhaps the only solutions are those where a=100, and b + c=200, which

---------------

 would give 201 solutions, plus the permutations of (200, 100, 0), which are 6, plus the triple (100,100,100). Wait, but wait

---------------

, when a=100, b=100, c=100, that's included in the a=100 case because

---------------

 b + c=200, but in that case, b=100, c=100, which is

---------------

 allowed. So, that's one of the 201 solutions.

But wait, earlier when I tried a=100, b=100, c=100, it worked. And

---------------

 when a=100, b=200, c=0, it worked, giving 6,000,000. So, that

---------------

 suggests that all triples where a=100 and b + c=200 are valid solutions. So, that's 201 solutions. But that

---------------

 seems too many, and the problem is asking for the number of triples, which is likely to be a small number, so

---------------

 perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the substitution when a=100.

When

---------------

 a=100, the expression becomes:

100²b + 100²c + b²*100 + b²c + c²*100 + c²b.

Which is 10,000b + 10,000c + 100b² + 100c² + 100c² + c²b.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I made a mistake in the earlier substitution. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, the expression is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

So, substituting a=100, we get:

100²b + 100²c + b²*100 + b²c + c²*100 + c²b.

Which is 10,000b + 10,000c + 100b² + b²c + 100c² + c²b.

Wait

---------------

, but when I set a=100, and b + c=200, then the expression becomes:

10,000b + 10,000c + 100b² + b²c + 100c² + c²b.

Now

---------------

, let me compute this for a=100, b=100, c=100:

10,000*100 +10,000*100 +100*(100)^2 + (100)^2*100 +100*(100)^2 + (100)^2*100.

Which

---------------

 is 1,000,000 +1,000,000 + 100*10,000 + 10,000*100 + 100*10,000 + 10,000*100.

Wait

---------------

, that's 1,000,000 +1,000,000 = 2,000,000.

Then, 100*10,000=1,000,000, and 

---------------

10,000*100=1,000,000, so two terms of

---------------

 1,000,000 each, totaling 2,000,000.

Similarly, the other two terms: 100*10,000=1,000,000 and 10,000*100=1,000,000, totaling

---------------

 another 2,000,000.

So, total sum is 2,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 6,000,000. That works.

Now, let's try a=100, b=200, c=0:

10,000*200 +10,000*0 +100*(200)^2 + (200)^2*0 +100*(0)^2 +0^2*200.

Which is 2,000,000 +0 +100*40,000 +0 +0 +0.

So, 2,000,000 +4,000,000 =6,000,000. That works.

Now, let me try a=100, b=150, c=50:

10,000*150 +10,000*50 +100*(150)^2 + (150)^2*50 +100*(50)^2 +50^2*150.

Compute each term:

10,000*150 =1,500,000
10,000*50=500,000
100*(22500)=2,250,000
22500*50=1,125,000
100*(2500)=250,000
2500*150=375,000

Now, sum all:

1,500,000 +500,000 =2,000,000
2,250,000 +1,125,000 =3,375,000
250,000 +375,000 =625,000

Total: 2,000,000 +3,375,000 =5,375,000 +625,000=6,000,000. That works.

Hmm

---------------

, so it seems that whenever a=100, and b + c=200, the expression equals 6,000,000. So, that suggests that all such triples are valid solutions. So, how many such triples are there?

Since a=100, and b + c=200, the number of nonnegative integer solutions is 201 (from b=0 to b=200). Each of these would be a distinct triple (100, b, 200 - b). So, that's 201 solutions.

But wait, earlier I found that (150, 100, 50) is a solution, which is

---------------

 not covered by a=100. So, that suggests that there are other solutions where a≠100. So, how can

---------------

 that be?

Wait, let me check the earlier substitution again. When I set a=100, and found that any b and c summing to 200 works, but when I set a=150, and

---------------

 found that (150,100,50) is a solution, that suggests that there are other solutions where a≠100.

Wait, but perhaps

---------------

 I made a mistake in the earlier analysis when I set a=100. Let me check again.

When a=100, the expression becomes:

100²b + 100²c + b²*100 + b²c + c²*100 + c²b.

Which simplifies to:

10,000b +10,000c +100b² +b²c +100c² +c²b.

Now

---------------

, since b + c=200, let me let c=200 -b. Substitute that into the expression:

10,000b +10,000*(200 -b) +100b² +b²*(200 -b) +100*(200 -b)^2 + (200 -b)^2 *b.

Simplify term by term:

10,000b + 2,000,000 -10,000b = 2,000,000.

100b² + b²*(200 -b) = 100b² + 200b² -b^3 = 300b² -b^3.

100*(200 -b)^2 =100*(40,000 -400b +b²) =4,000,000 -40,000b +100b².

(200 -b)^2 *b = (40,000 -400b +b²)*b =40,000b -400b² +b^3.

Now, sum all terms:

2,000,000 + (300b² -b^3) + (4,000,000 -40,000b +100b²) + (40,000b -400b² +b^3).

Combine like terms:

2,000,000 +4,000,000 =6,000,000.

300b² +100b² -400b² =0.

-b^3 +b^3=0.

-40,000b +40,000b=0.

So, everything cancels out, leaving 6,000,000. So, yes

---------------

, for any a=100 and b + c=200, the expression equals 6,000,000. So, that's 201 solutions.

But then, earlier, I found that (150,100,50) is also a solution, which isn't covered by a=100. So, that suggests that there are other solutions outside of a=100. So, perhaps

---------------

 the total number of solutions is 201 (from a=100) plus the solutions from other a's, like a=150, etc.

Wait, but when

---------------

 I tried a=150, b=100, c=50, that worked, but what about other a's? Let me see.

Wait, but

---------------

 perhaps I can think of the problem in a different way. The expression a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b can be rewritten as ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c). But

---------------

 since a + b + c=300, then a + b=300 -c, a + c=300 -b, and b + c=300 -a. So, the expression becomes:

ab*(300 -c) + ac*(300 -b) + bc*(300 -a).

Which

---------------

 is equal to 300(ab + ac + bc) - (abc + abc + abc) = 300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc.

So, the expression is 300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc =6,000,000.

So, 300(ab + ac + bc) -3abc =6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc =2,000,000.

So, the equation becomes:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc =2,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps this form is easier to work with. Let me write that:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc =2,000,000.

Let

---------------

 me rearrange it:

abc -100(ab + ac + bc) = -2,000,000.

Hmm, that

---------------

 might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor it differently.

Alternatively, let me think of this as:

abc =100(ab + ac + bc) -2,000,000.

But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can write

---------------

 the equation as:

abc =100(ab + ac + bc) -2,000,000.

Hmm

---------------

, perhaps I can factor out ab + ac + bc, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider

---------------

 the equation:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc =2,000,000.

Let me factor

---------------

 100 out:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc =2,000,000.

Hmm

---------------

, perhaps I can write this as:

abc -100(ab + ac + bc) = -2,000,000.

But

---------------

 I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the equation as:

abc -100(ab + ac + bc) +2,000,000 =0.

But I'm not sure how to proceed from here.

Wait, perhaps I can try

---------------

 substituting specific values for a, b, c. For example, when a=100, we saw that any b + c=200 works. So, that gives 201 solutions. Now

---------------

, when a=150, b=100, c=50 works. Let me see if other

---------------

 values of a can give solutions.

Wait, perhaps I can find a general solution. Let me suppose that one of the variables is 100, say

---------------

 a=100, then as before, any b + c=200 works. Similarly, if b=100, then a + c=200, and if

---------------

 c=100, then a + b=200. So, each of these cases would give 201 solutions, but we

---------------

 have to be careful not to double-count the cases where two variables are 100, like (100,100,100), which is counted in all three cases.

Wait, but in

---------------

 reality, when a=100, b + c=200, which includes the case where b=100 and c=100. Similarly, when b=100, a + c=200, which includes a=100 and c=100. So, the total number of solutions where at least one variable is 100 would be 3*201 - 3*(1) + 1.

---------------

 Wait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the number of solutions where a=100, plus those where a≠100 but the

---------------

 equation holds.

Wait, but from earlier, when a=100, there are 201 solutions. Now

---------------

, when a≠100, like a=150, we found that (150,100,50) is a solution. So

---------------

, perhaps there are other solutions where none of the variables are 100.

Wait, let me try to find another solution where none of a, b, c is 100. Let me suppose

---------------

 that a=120, b=80, c=100. Wait, but c=100, which we've already considered. Alternatively, let me try a=12

---------------

0, b=90, c=90. Let's check if that works.

Sum:120+90+90=300.

Compute the expression:

120²*90 +120²*90 +90²*120 +90²*90 +90²*120 +90²*90.

Compute each term:

120²=14,400.

---------------

 So, 14,400*90=1,296,000. Two of these: 2,592,000.

90²=8,100. 8,100*120=972,000. Two of these: 1,944,000.

8,100*90=729,000. Two of these: 1,458,000.

Total sum:2,592,000 +1,944,000=4,536,000 +1,458,000=5,994,000. That's 6,000,000 -6,000. So, not quite. So, that's not a solution.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let me think

---------------

 about the equation:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc =2,000,000.

Let me write

---------------

 this as:

abc -100(ab + ac + bc) = -2,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this as

---------------

:

abc -100(ab + ac + bc) = -2,000,000.

Hmm

---------------

, maybe I can factor it as:

abc -100ab -100ac -100bc = -2,000,000.

Hmm

---------------

, perhaps adding 10000 to both sides would help, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor

---------------

 it as:

( a -100 )( b -100 )( c -100 ) = something.

Wait, let me try expanding (a -100)(b -100)(c -100):

= abc -100ab -100ac -100bc +10,000a +10,000b +10,000c -1,000,000.

Hmm, that

---------------

's similar to our equation. Let me compare:

We have:

abc -100ab -100ac -100bc = -2,000,000.

So

---------------

, from the expansion:

(a -100)(b -100)(c -100) = abc -100ab -100ac -100bc +10,000a +10,000b +10,000c -1,000,000.

But

---------------

 our equation is:

abc -100ab -100ac -100bc = -2,000,000.

So, substit

---------------

uting:

(a -100)(b -100)(c -100) = (-2,000,000) +10,000(a + b + c) -1,000,000.

But a + b + c=300, so:

= (-2,000,000) +10,000*300 -1,000,000
= (-2,000,000) +3,000,000 -1,000,000
= 0.

So, (a -100)(b -100)(c -100) =0.

Which

---------------

 implies that at least one of the factors is zero. So, either a=100, or b=100, or c=100.

Ah

---------------

! So, this means that any solution must have at least one of the variables equal to 100. So, all solutions must have a=100, or b=100, or c=100.

That

---------------

's a crucial insight. So, the only solutions are those where at least one variable is 100. So, that

---------------

 means that the earlier case where a=150, b=100, c=50 is a solution because b=100. Similarly, the case where a=100, b=150, c=50 is a solution because a=100. So, all solutions must have at least one variable equal to 100.

So

---------------

, that means that the only possible solutions are the ones where one of the variables is 100, and the other two sum to 200. So, that

---------------

's the 201 solutions where a=100, plus the 201 solutions where b=100, and the 201 solutions where c=100. But wait, that would count some solutions multiple times. For example, the solution (100,100,100) would be counted in all three cases. So, we need to account

---------------

 for overlaps.

Wait, but according to the equation (a-100)(b-100)(c-100)=0, any

---------------

 solution must have at least one variable equal to 100. So, all solutions are covered by cases where a=100, or b=100, or c=100. So, the total number of solutions is the number of triples where a=100, plus the number where b=100, plus the number where c=100, minus the overlaps where two variables are 100, plus the solution where all three are 100.

So, let's compute that.

Number of solutions where a=100: 

---------------

201 (since b + c=200).

Similarly, number where b=100: 201.

Number where c=100:201.

Now, the overlaps where two variables are 100:

-

---------------

 a=100 and b=100: Then c=300 -100 -100=100. So, only one solution: (100,100,100).

Similarly, a=100 and c=100: same as above.

And b=100 and c=100: same as above.

So, each pair contributes

---------------

 one solution, but all three being 100 is the same solution.

So, the total number of solutions is:

3*201 - 3*1 +1 = 603 -3 +1=601.

Wait, that

---------------

's 3*201=603, minus 3*1=3 (for the overlaps where two variables are 100, each counted twice), plus 1 for the solution where all three are 100, which was subtracted too many times.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the inclusion-exclusion principle should be applied here.

Total solutions = (number where a=100) + (number where b=100) + (number where c=100) - (number where a=100 and b=100) - (number where a=100 and c=100) - (number where b=100 and c=100) + (number where a=100 and b=100 and c=100).

So

---------------

, substituting:

= 201 +201 +201 -1 -1 -1 +1.

Compute

---------------

:

201*3=603.

Then, subtract 1 three times: 603 -3=600.

Add 1: 600 +1=601.

So, the total number of solutions is 601.

Wait, but earlier I found that (150,100,50) is a solution where b=100, which is included in the 201 solutions where b=100. Similarly, (100,150,50) is included in a=100. So, this

---------------

 seems to align.

But wait, earlier when I thought that a=100 gives 201 solutions, and similarly

---------------

 for b=100 and c=100, each giving 201, but with overlaps, the total is 601. So, that's the number of solutions.

But let me verify

---------------

 this. For example, the solution (100,100,100) is counted once in each of a=100, b=100, c=100, so in

---------------

 the inclusion-exclusion, it's added three times, then subtracted three times for the overlaps, and then added once,

---------------

 so it's counted once in total, which is correct.

Similarly, a solution like (100,150,50) is only counted in a=100, and not in b=100 or c=100, so it's correctly

---------------

 included once.

Similarly, a solution where b=100, like (150,100,50), is counted in b=100, and not elsewhere.

So, the

---------------

 total number of solutions is 601.

But wait, earlier I thought that when a=100, any b + c=200 works, giving 201 solutions, but when

---------------

 I tried a=100, b=120, c=80, the expression worked. So, that

---------------

's consistent.

But then, when I considered the case where a=150, b=100, c=50, that's included in the b=100 case, which gives

---------------

 201 solutions, so it's already counted.

So, according to this, the total number of solutions is 601.

Wait, but let

---------------

 me think again. When a=100, b can be from 0 to 200, giving 201 solutions. Similarly, when b=100, a can be from 0 to 200, giving 201 solutions. But some

---------------

 of these solutions overlap, like when a=100 and b=100, which is the solution (100,100,100). So, using

---------------

 inclusion-exclusion, we get 601 solutions.

But wait, the problem is asking for the number of triples (a, b, c) where a, b, c are nonnegative integers. So, according

---------------

 to this analysis, the answer should be 601.

But wait, earlier I thought that (150,100,50) is a solution, and it

---------------

's included in the b=100 case, so it's counted in the 601.

But let me check

---------------

 another case where a=200, b=100, c=0. That's a solution where a=200, which is not covered by a=100, but according to our earlier analysis, all

---------------

 solutions must have at least one variable equal to 100. But in this case, b=100, so it is covered by the b=100 case. So, that

---------------

's included in the 601 solutions.

Similarly, the solution (100, 200, 0) is included in a=100.

So, all

---------------

 the solutions we found earlier are included in the 601 count.

Therefore, the total number of triples is 601.


The number of triples is calculated

---------------

 by considering all cases where at least one variable equals 100, leading to a total of 601 solutions.
