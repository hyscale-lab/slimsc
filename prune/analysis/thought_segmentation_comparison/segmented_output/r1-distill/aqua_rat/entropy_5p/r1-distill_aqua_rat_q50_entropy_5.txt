Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about a money pouch with Rs. 700, and there are equal numbers of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins, and one rupee coins. I need to find out how many of each coin there are. The options are given as A)453, B)651, C)400, D)487, E)286. Wait, but

---------------

 the options seem a bit odd because each option is a single number, but the problem asks for the count of each coin. Maybe each option represents the number of each type of coin? Like

---------------

, if the answer is C)400, then there are 400 coins of each type. That would make sense because the

---------------

 question says "how many of each are there," implying the count per type.

Alright, let's break this down. So, all

---------------

 three types of coins—25 paise, 50 paise, and 1 rupee—have the same number of coins. Let's denote the number of each as 'n'. So, n coins of 25 paise, n of 50, and n of 1 rupee.

Now, the total amount is Rs. 700. Let

---------------

's convert everything into paise to make calculations easier. 1 rupee is 100 paise. So, the 1 rupee coins contribute 100 * n paise. The 50 paise coins contribute 50 * n paise, and the 25 paise coins contribute 25 * n paise.

Adding all these together gives the total amount in paise: 100n + 50n + 25n = 175n paise. But since the total is Rs. 700, which is 700 * 100 = 70,000 paise.

So, the equation is 175n = 70,000. Let me solve for n. Dividing both sides by 175:

n = 70,000 / 175.

Hmm, what's 70,000 divided by 175? Let's calculate. Well, 175 times 400 is 70,000 because 175*400 = 70,000. So, n is 400.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 400. So that would mean each type has 400 coins. Let me double-check the

---------------

 math to be sure.

Calculating the total amount with n=400:
- 25 paise: 25 *400 = 10,000 paise = 100 rupees.
- 50 paise:50 *400 = 20,000 paise = 200 rupees.
- 1 rupee: 100 *400 = 40,000 paise = 400 rupees.
Adding these: 100 + 200 + 400 = 700 rupees. Yep, that adds up perfectly.

So the correct answer should be option C)400.


To solve the problem, let the number of each type of coin be \( n \). The total amount contributed by each type of coin in paise is:

- **25 paise coins**: \( 25n \) paise  
- **50 paise coins**: \( 50n \) paise  
- **1 rupee coins**: \( 100n \) paise  

The total amount in paise is \( 700 \times 100 = 70,000 \) paise. Adding the contributions from all coins:

\[
25n + 50n + 100n = 175n
\]

Setting this equal to the total amount:

\[
175n = 70,000
\]

Solving for \( n \):

\[
n = \frac{70,000}{175} = 400
\]

Thus, there are 400 coins of each type. Verifying the total amount:

- **25 paise coins**: \( 25 \times 400 = 10,000 \) paise \( = 100 \) rupees  
- **50 paise coins**: \( 50 \times 400 = 20,000 \) paise \( = 200 \) rupees  
- **1 rupee coins**: \( 100 \times 400 = 40,000 \) paise \( = 400 \) rupees  

Adding these: \( 100 + 200 + 400 = 700 \) rupees, which matches the given total. Therefore, the correct answer is:
