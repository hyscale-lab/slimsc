Okay, so I've got this problem here about a worker who drives to work and now wants to cycle the same route. The question is asking how long it will take to cycle. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, so first, I remember that time, speed, and distance are related by the formula: time = distance divided by speed. That

---------------

's the key here. The worker's drive and cycle trips are along the same route, so the distance is the same for both. 

Wait, the problem says it takes the worker 9 minutes to drive at 20 km/h. I need to find the time it takes to cycle at 6 km/h. So maybe I can find the distance first using the driving details and then use that to find the cycling time.

Let me calculate the distance. But

---------------

 wait, the time given is in minutes, and the speed is in km per hour. I should convert the time to hours to match the units. So

---------------

 9 minutes is how many hours? There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 9 divided by 60 is 0.15 hours. Yeah

---------------

, because 60 times 0.15 is 9. So 0.15 hours.

Now, distance equals speed multiplied by time. So when driving, the distance is 20 km/h multiplied by 0.15 h. Let me do that math. 20 * 0.15 is 3. So the distance from home to work is 3 kilometers. Oh

---------------

, that's straightforward.

Now, for cycling, the speed is 6 km/h. Using the same distance of 3 km, time equals distance divided by speed. So 3 km divided by 6 km/h. Hmm, 3/6 is 0.5. But that's in hours, right? Because the speed is per hour.

So 0.5 hours. I

---------------

 need to convert that back to minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 0.5 hours is 30 minutes. Wait, but wait

---------------

 a second. Let me check that again.

Wait, 0.5 hours is 30 minutes because 0.5 *60 =30. So the cycling time would be 30 minutes? But looking at the options, option A is 30. But I'm

---------------

 a bit confused because 6 km/h seems slow, but maybe that's right.

Wait, another way to think about it. If

---------------

 the distance is 3 km, and the cycling speed is 6 km/h, then how long does it take to go 3 km? At

---------------

 6 km per hour, every hour you go 6 km, so 3 km is half of that, so half an hour, which is 30 minutes. Yeah, that makes sense.

So the answer should be option A)30. But wait, let

---------------

 me make sure I didn't make a mistake with the time conversion. Oh yeah, 9 minutes is 9/60 = 0.15 hours. 20 * 0.15 is 3 km. 3 divided by 6 is 0.5 hours, which is 30 minutes. Yep

---------------

, that's correct.


To determine how long it will take the worker to cycle from home to work, we start by calculating the distance of the route using the driving details. The worker drives at an average speed of 20 km/h and takes 9 minutes. Since time is given in minutes, we convert it to hours:  
\[
9 \, \text{minutes} = \frac{9}{60} = 0.15 \, \text{hours}.
\]  
The distance is then calculated using the formula:  
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}.
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
\text{Distance} = 20 \, \text{km/h} \times 0.15 \, \text{h} = 3 \, \text{km}.
\]  
Now, for cycling, the worker's average speed is 6 km/h. Using the same distance of 3 km, we calculate the time using the formula:  
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}.
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{3 \, \text{km}}{6 \, \text{km/h}} = 0.5 \, \text{hours}.
\]  
Finally, we convert the time back to minutes:  
\[
0.5 \, \text{hours} \times 60 \, \text{minutes/hour} = 30 \, \text{minutes}.
\]  
Thus, it will take the worker 30 minutes to cycle from home to work.
