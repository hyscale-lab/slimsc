Okay, so I've got this problem here about a cereal mixture. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The problem says the mixture has rice, wheat, and corn in the ratio of 2:3:5. Hmm

---------------

, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but I think I remember that ratios tell us how much of each part there is relative to each other.

So the ratio is 2:3:5. That means for every 2 parts of rice, there are 3 parts of wheat and 5 parts of corn. Wait

---------------

, but how do I apply that to the actual quantities given?

The question states that a bag of this mixture contains 3 pounds of rice. I need to find out how much corn is in the bag. 



---------------

Let me think about ratios and proportions. Ratios can be converted into fractions or parts. So if the total ratio is 2+3+5, that's 10 parts in total. Oh

---------------

 wait, no, wait. The total parts would be 2 (rice) +3 (wheat) +5 (corn) = 10 parts in total.

But wait, the

---------------

 3 pounds of rice is part of this. Since rice is 2 parts, then 2 parts correspond to 3 pounds. So each part must be 3 divided by 2, right? Let me calculate that. 3 divided by 2 is 1.5. So each part is 1.5 pounds.

Now, I need to find out how much corn there is. Corn is 5 parts. So 5 parts multiplied by 1.5 pounds per part. Let me compute that. 5 times 1.5 is 7.5. So the corn should be 7.5 pounds.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps. The

---------------

 ratio is 2:3:5, so for every 2 parts rice, 3 wheat, 5 corn. The

---------------

 total is 10 parts. But wait, I didn't need the total for this calculation because I used the individual ratio parts

---------------

. 

Wait, another approach: the ratio of rice to corn is 2:5. So the amount of rice is 3 pounds. So setting

---------------

 up the proportion: 2/5 = 3/x. Wait, no, that's not right. Because 2 parts rice to

---------------

 5 parts corn. So rice is 2, corn is 5. So the proportion is rice/corn = 2/5. So 3/x = 2/5. Solving for x: x= (3 *5)/2 = 15/2=7.5. Same

---------------

 answer.

So that's consistent. So the corn should be 7.5 pounds. Let me look at the options.

Options are:
A)6.5
B)7.5
C)7
D)6
E)None of the above

B is 7.5, which matches my calculation. So the correct answer should be B.


The cereal mixture contains rice, wheat, and corn in the ratio of 2:3:5. This means for every 2 parts of rice, there are 3 parts of wheat and 5 parts of corn. The total number of parts in the mixture is \(2 + 3 + 5 = 10\) parts. However, since the problem only asks for the amount of corn, we can focus on the ratio of rice to corn, which is \(2:5\).

Given that the bag contains 3 pounds of rice, we can determine the value of one part. Since 2 parts correspond to 3 pounds, one part is \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) pounds. Corn consists of 5 parts, so the amount of corn is \(5 \times 1.5 = 7.5\) pounds.

To confirm, we can set up the proportion \(\frac{\text{rice}}{\text{corn}} = \frac{2}{5}\). Substituting the given rice amount, \(\frac{3}{x} = \frac{2}{5}\), solving for \(x\) gives \(x = \frac{3 \times 5}{2} = 7.5\). This matches the earlier calculation.

Thus, the bag contains 7.5 pounds of corn. Among the options provided, the correct answer is **B) 7.5**.
