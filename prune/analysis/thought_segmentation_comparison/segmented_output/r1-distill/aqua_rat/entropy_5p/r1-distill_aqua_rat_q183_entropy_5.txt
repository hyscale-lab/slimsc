Okay, let's try to figure this problem out. So the question says, "A number is as much greater than 36 as it is less than 86." Hmm, I need to find what that number is. Let me break it down.

First, I'll try

---------------

 to translate the words into a mathematical equation. The number is greater than 36 by a certain amount, and it's less than 86 by the same amount. So, let's denote the number as x.

The phrase "as much greater than 36" suggests that x is 36 plus some difference. Similarly, "as much less than 86" implies that x is 86 minus the same difference. So the difference between

---------------

 x and 36 should be equal to the difference between 86 and x.

Wait, how do I write that? Oh right, the

---------------

 difference when x is greater than 36 is x - 36. And the difference when 86 is greater than x is 86 - x. Since these differences are equal, I can set up the equation:

x - 36 = 86 - x.

Now I need to solve for x. Let's add x to both sides to get rid of the minus x on the right. So, x + x -36 =86. That simplifies to 2x -36 =86.

Next, I'll add 36 to both sides. So 2x = 86 +36. 86 plus 36 is... let me calculate. 80+30 is 110, 6+6 is 12, so 110+12 is 122. So 2x=122.

Then I divide both sides by 2 to solve for x. 122 divided by 2 is 61. So x=61.

Let me check if that makes sense. If x is 61, then how much greater is it than 36? 61-36 is 25. How much less is it than 86? 86-61 is also 25. Yes, that works. Both differences are the same, so 61 is the correct number.

Looking at the options, D is 61. So the answer should be D.


The problem states that a number is as much greater than 36 as it is less than 86. Let the number be \( x \). The difference between \( x \) and 36 is \( x - 36 \), and the difference between 86 and \( x \) is \( 86 - x \). Since these differences are equal, we set up the equation:

\[
x - 36 = 86 - x
\]

Adding \( x \) to both sides gives:

\[
2x - 36 = 86
\]

Adding 36 to both sides:

\[
2x = 122
\]

Dividing by 2:

\[
x = 61
\]

To verify, \( 61 - 36 = 25 \) and \( 86 - 61 = 25 \), confirming the differences are equal. Thus, the number is 61.
