Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6. Also, the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. I need to find the probability that event B occurs.

Hmm, right

---------------

. So, since A and B are independent, that means the occurrence of one doesn't affect the other. I remember that for independent events, the probability of both happening is the product of their individual probabilities. So P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).

But wait, the question is about the probability that at least one occurs. Oh right, the formula for the probability of at least one of two events occurring is P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Since

---------------

 they are independent, P(A and B) is P(A) * P(B), so substituting that in, it becomes P(A) + P(B) - P(A)*P(B).

Given

---------------

 that P(A or B) is 0.96, and P(A) is 0.6, I can plug those into the equation.

Let me write that down:

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)*P(B)
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B))

Hmm, let's simplify the right side. So

---------------

 0.6 + P(B) minus 0.6 P(B). Let me factor that.

0.6 + P(B)(1 - 0.6) = 0.6 + 0.4 * P(B)

So the equation becomes 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4 P(B)

Now I'll subtract 0.6 from both sides to isolate the term with P(B).

0.96 - 0.6 = 0.4 P(B)
0.36 = 0.4 P(B)

So

---------------

 P(B) is 0.36 divided by 0.4. Let's calculate that.

0.36 / 0.4 is the same as 36/40, which simplifies to 9/10, so 0.9.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because if P(B) is 0.9, then let me check if

---------------

 that makes sense.

Let me plug back in to the original equation:

P(A or B) = 0.6 + 0.9 - (0.6 * 0.9)
So

---------------

 that's 0.6 + 0.9 = 1.5. Then subtract 0.54 (since 0.6 * 0.9 is 0.54). 1.5 - 0.54 is 0.96, which matches the given value.

Oh, wait, but the

---------------

 options don't have E as 0.9 as the correct answer. Wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A)0.5, B)0.6, C)0.7, D)0.8, E)0.9. So E is 0.9. So that would be the correct answer, right?

But wait a second, I

---------------

 thought that maybe I made a mistake because 0.9 seems high. Let me think again.

If P(A) is 0.6 and P(B) is 0.9, then the probability that at least one occurs is 0.96. So

---------------

 that's correct because 0.6 + 0.9 = 1.5, minus 0.54 is 0.96. So yes

---------------

, that's correct.

So the probability of B is 0.9, which is option E.

Wait, but I

---------------

 just thought that if B is 0.9, then the probability of at least one is 0.96, which is even

---------------

 higher than both. That's possible because when they are independent, their combined probabilities can sometimes sum beyond 1, but the

---------------

 formula correctly subtracts the overlap.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me do the steps again.

0

---------------

.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6 P(B)
Which is 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B)(1 - 0.6)
So 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4 P(B)
Subtract 0.6: 0.36 = 0.4 P(B)
Divide both sides by 0.4: P(B) = 0.36 / 0.4 = 0.9.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be E)0.9.


The problem involves two independent events, A and B. The probability that event A occurs is given as \( P(A) = 0.6 \), and the probability that at least one of the events occurs is \( P(A \text{ or } B) = 0.96 \). The goal is to find \( P(B) \).

Since A and B are independent, the probability of both events occurring is \( P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \cdot P(B) \). The formula for the probability of at least one event occurring is:

\[
P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A) \cdot P(B)
\]

Substituting the known values \( P(A) = 0.6 \) and \( P(A \text{ or } B) = 0.96 \) into the equation:

\[
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 \cdot P(B))
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side:

\[
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B)(1 - 0.6)
\]

\[
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)
\]

Subtracting \( 0.6 \) from both sides:

\[
0.36 = 0.4P(B)
\]

Dividing both sides by \( 0.4 \):

\[
P(B) = \frac{0.36}{0.4} = 0.9
\]

To verify, substituting \( P(B) = 0.9 \) back into the formula for \( P(A \text{ or } B) \):

\[
P(A \text{ or } B) = 0.6 + 0.9 - (0.6 \cdot 0.9)
\]

\[
P(A \text{ or } B) = 0.6 + 0.9 - 0.54 = 0.96
\]

This matches the given value of \( P(A \text{ or } B) = 0.96 \), confirming that \( P(B) = 0.9 \).

Thus, the probability that event B occurs is **0.9**, which corresponds to option **E**.
