Okay, so I've got this problem here about exam marks, and I need to figure out the value of M. Let me read it again and try to understand what's going on.

The question says that a candidate scored 504 marks out of the maximum M. Then, if M is converted into 800 marks, the candidate would have secured 420 marks. Hmm, wait, I think I need to model

---------------

 this with some equations.

So, initially, the candidate's score is 504 out of M. That means their percentage or ratio of the total is 504/M. But then, when the maximum mark is changed to 800, their score becomes 420. So,

---------------

 I guess this 420 is their new score based on the same performance, just scaled to the new maximum.

Wait, so

---------------

 the candidate's actual performance corresponds to 504/M of the total, and when the total is 800, 420 is their new score. So the ratio of their score to the maximum should be the same in both cases, right? Because it's the same exam, just scaling

---------------

 the marks.

So, the ratio 504/M should be equal to 420/800. That

---------------

 makes sense because the proportion of the marks they got shouldn't change when scaling the maximum.

Let me write that as an equation: 504 / M = 420 / 800.

Now, I can solve for M. Let me rearrange this. Cross-multiplying, I get 504 * 800 = 420 * M.

Calculating the left side: 504 * 800. Let me do that step by step. 500 * 800 is 400,000, and 4 * 800 is 3,200. So total is 403,200.

On the right side, 420 * M. So,

---------------

 420 * M = 403,200.

To find M, I divide both sides by 420. So, M = 403,200 / 420.

Let me compute that. 403,200 divided by 420. Hmm, I

---------------

 can simplify this division. Let's see, 420 goes into 403200 how many times?

Alternatively, maybe I can break it down. 420 is 42 * 10. So, 403200 divided by 42 is the

---------------

 same as (403200 / 42) / 10.

Wait, 403200 divided by 42. Let me see, 42 times 9600 is 403200 because 42 * 9000=378000, and 42*600=25200. 378000 +25200=403200. So 42*9600=403200. So 403200/42=9600. Then, since

---------------

 I had divided by 10 earlier, that would make it 9600/10=960.

Wait, no, wait. Let

---------------

 me recheck. Because the original equation was 403200 = 420 * M. So M is 403200 / 420. Which

---------------

 is the same as 403200 divided by 420. Let me compute that.

Alternatively, 

---------------

420 is 4.2e2, so 403200 /420 = (403200 / 420). Let me compute

---------------

 403200 divided by 420.

Divide numerator and denominator by 10: 40320 /42.

Now, 42 times 960 is 40320 because 42*900=37800, 42*60=2520. 37800+2520=40320. So 40320/42 is 960. So 403200/420 is 960. So M is 960.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 960. So the answer should be E.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me go

---------------

 through the steps again.

Original equation: 504/M = 420/800.

Cross multiply: 504 * 800 = 420 * M.

504 * 800: 504 * 8 = 4032, so 504*800=403200.

420 * M = 403200 → M = 403200 /420.

Compute

---------------

 403200 /420. Let's see, 420 * 960 = ?

4

---------------

20 * 900 = 378,000.

420 * 60 = 25,200.

Adding them: 378,000 +25,200=403,200. So yes, M=960.

Looking at the options, E is 960. So the correct answer is E.


The problem involves determining the maximum mark \( M \) in an exam where a candidate scored 504 marks. When \( M \) is converted to 800 marks, the candidate's score becomes 420. Since the ratio of the candidate's score to the maximum remains constant, we set up the equation:

\[
\frac{504}{M} = \frac{420}{800}.
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
504 \times 800 = 420 \times M.
\]

Calculating the left side:

\[
504 \times 800 = 403,200.
\]

Thus:

\[
420 \times M = 403,200.
\]

Solving for \( M \):

\[
M = \frac{403,200}{420} = 960.
\]

Therefore, the value of \( M \) is 960, which corresponds to option E.
