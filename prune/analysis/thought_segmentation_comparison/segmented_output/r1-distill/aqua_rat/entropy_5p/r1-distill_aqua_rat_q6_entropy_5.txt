Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers. The question is asking how many letters need to be distinct. Hmm, wait, no

---------------

, wait. Let me read that again. Oh right, the question is, "How many letters need to be distinct?" Or

---------------

 wait, no, the initial part is asking for the total number of distinct bike numbers, and then the options are given. So maybe I'm getting

---------------

 the question wrong. Let me read it again.

The problem says: "Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?" Wait, that doesn

---------------

't make sense. Oh, wait, maybe the question is, given that the two letters must be distinct, what's the total number? Or perhaps, do

---------------

 the letters have to be distinct, or not? Hmm, the way it's phrased is a bit confusing. Let me re

---------------

-examine the exact wording.

The original question: "Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?" Oh, wait, perhaps the question

---------------

 is part of a larger problem, but perhaps the question is: You have to form a bike number consisting of two letters followed by two numbers. How many such distinct numbers can be formed? And the

---------------

 options are given. But wait, the initial question seems to be asking about the count, but then the second part is a separate question,

---------------

 which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is: Find the total number of distinct bike numbers formed by 2 letters followed by 2 numbers, with the condition that the letters must be distinct. So

---------------

 the letters must be different, and the numbers can be anything.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me parse

---------------

 the question again. The problem says, "Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?"

Wait, that seems

---------------

 like two separate questions. Or perhaps, the first part is the problem, and the second part is the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question

---------------

 is: "Find the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers. How many letters need to be distinct?" Which

---------------

 would imply that the letters must be distinct, so the problem is to calculate that number.

Alternatively, maybe the letters don't need to be distinct, but the question is how

---------------

 many letters need to be distinct, which would be a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me try

---------------

 again.

The problem is: "Find the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers. How many letters need to be distinct?"

No, that can't be. Because

---------------

 if the question is about the total number, the letters' distinctness is a condition. So I think the correct interpretation is: You

---------------

 have to find the total number of possible bike numbers where each number is two letters followed by two digits. And the letters must be distinct (so two

---------------

 different letters), while the digits can repeat or not? Or perhaps the digits can also repeat. But the problem doesn't specify whether

---------------

 digits need to be distinct. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says, "using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s." So perhaps

---------------

 the two letters are followed by two numbers (digits). The question is, how many such distinct bike numbers can be formed, given that the letters must be distinct. Or is

---------------

 the letters' distinctness not a requirement?

Wait, the problem is a bit ambiguous. Let me read the exact wording again.

"Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?"

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the problem is asking for the total number of possible bike numbers, given that the two letters can be the same or different, and the two numbers can be same or different. But then, the second part is a question: How many letters need to be distinct? Which

---------------

 doesn't make sense in that context. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased as: You have to form a bike number with two letters followed by two digits. How many such distinct numbers are possible if the two letters must be distinct?

So

---------------

, perhaps the problem is: Letters must be distinct, and digits can be anything. Or perhaps digits must also be distinct. The

---------------

 problem isn't entirely clear. But given the options, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that letters must be distinct and digits can be anything.

Let

---------------

 me outline the steps.

First, the bike number format is: 2 letters followed by 2 digits.

Assuming that letters can be uppercase English letters (26 letters), but sometimes in

---------------

 such problems, it's 26 letters plus numbers, but no, wait, the letters are letters, digits are digits. So letters

---------------

 are 26 possible, digits are 10 possible.

Now, the letters: if they must be distinct, then the first letter can be any of 26, the second letter can be any of 25 (since it can't be the same as the first). If they can repeat, then it's 26 * 26.

But

---------------

 the problem states, "How many letters need to be distinct?" which suggests that the letters must be distinct, so we're

---------------

 to compute the count under that condition.

Wait, but the question is phrased as a single sentence: Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?"

Wait, perhaps the question

---------------

 is: What is the total number of distinct bike numbers possible when using 2 letters followed by 2 digits, and how many of the letters must be distinct?

---------------

 But that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is: How many distinct bike numbers can be formed if the letters must be distinct, and the digits can be anything.

So

---------------

, proceeding under that assumption.

So, letters: two letters, distinct. So 26 options for first letter, 25 for the second. D

---------------

igits: two digits, can be same or different. So 10 options for each digit.

So total combinations would be 26 *25 * 10 *10.

Let

---------------

 me compute that.

26*25 = 650.

10*10=100.

650 * 100 = 65,000.

Looking at the options, option D is 65000.

So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let

---------------

 me double-check.

Wait, wait. Wait, is there a possibility that the letters can be the same? Like, does

---------------

 the problem require the letters to be distinct or not?

The way the question is phrased: "Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?" Hmm

---------------

, perhaps the first part is the problem, and the second is part of the options. Or perhaps, the problem is ph

---------------

rased as: "Find the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers. How many letters need to be distinct?" But

---------------

 that still isn't entirely clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking: How many letters need to be distinct (i.e., the

---------------

 number of distinct letters used in the bike numbers), but that doesn't fit with the options given. The options are all numbers

---------------

 in the tens of thousands, which suggests they're counts of possible bike numbers.

So perhaps the correct interpretation is that the letters must be distinct, and the digits can be any digits

---------------

. So the calculation is 26 *25 *10 *10 = 65,000, which is option D.

Alternatively

---------------

, if the letters can be the same, the calculation would be 26*26*10*10= 67,600, which isn't an option. The

---------------

 options given are A)74453, B)64543, C)74325, D)65000, E)97656.

So 65,000 is option D.

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps the letters don't have to be distinct, but the digits must be distinct. Let's see what that would give.

Letters: 26 *26 = 676.

Digits: 10 *9 =90.

Total: 676 *90 = 60,840, which isn't an option either.

Another

---------------

 possibility: letters must be distinct, and digits must also be distinct.

Letters: 26 *25 = 650.

Digits:10 *9=90.

Total: 650 *90=58,500. Not an option.

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps the problem is that letters must be distinct, and digits can be anything. So 26 *25 *10*10=65,000, which is option D.

So

---------------

 I think the correct answer is D)65000.


To determine the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 digits, we assume the letters must be distinct, while the digits can repeat. 

1. **Letters**: There are 26 possible letters in the English alphabet. Since the letters must be distinct:
   - The first letter has 26 options.
   - The second letter has 25 options (since it cannot repeat the first).
   - Total combinations for letters: \( 26 \times 25 = 650 \).

2. **Digits**: There are 10 possible digits (0-9). Since digits can repeat:
   - The first digit has 10 options.
   - The second digit has 10 options.
   - Total combinations for digits: \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \).

3. **Total combinations**: Multiply the combinations for letters and digits:
   \[
   650 \times 100 = 65,000
   \]

This matches option D.
