Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully

---------------

.

The question says: In a chocolate store, all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored only. 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, 90% of the rest are squashed. What percentage of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed?

Hmm, let

---------------

 me break this down. So, the chocolates are only two types: vanilla or cocoa. So, all of them are vanilla or all are cocoa. There's no third option.

First, 10% are cocoa. That means the remaining 90% must be vanilla because they

---------------

're the only other option. So, total vanilla is 90%.

Now, the next part says 90% of the rest are squashed. Wait, "the rest"—does

---------------

 that refer to the vanilla ones or the remaining after considering both? Let me think.

I think the "rest" here refers to the vanilla chocolates because the

---------------

 initial 10% are cocoa. So, the rest would be 90% (vanilla). So, of those 90%, 90% are squashed. That

---------------

 leaves 10% of the vanilla chocolates that are not squashed.

Wait, let me rephrase. Total chocolates: 100% (for simplicity, let's assume 100 chocolates).

---------------

 10% are cocoa, so 10 chocolates. The remaining 90 are vanilla. Now, 90% of the vanilla are squashed. So, 90% of 90 is 81. So, 81 vanilla chocolates are squashed. That leaves 90 -81 =9 vanilla chocolates that are not squashed.

Wait, but the question is asking for the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla and not squashed. So, 

---------------

9 out of 100, which is 9%. So, looking at the options, D is 9%, so that should be the answer.

Wait, but I should

---------------

 double-check. Let me structure it more formally.

Let me denote:
Total chocolates = 100 (for easy percentage calculations)
Cocoa = 10% of 100 =10
Vanilla = 90 (since 100-10=90)

Now, 90% of the vanilla are squashed. So, 90% of 90 =81 squashed vanilla.
So

---------------

, the vanilla that's not squashed is 90 -81 =9.

So, the percentage is 9/100 *100% =9%.

Looking at the options, D is 9%, so the answer is D.


To solve the problem, we start by noting that all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored. Since 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, the remaining 90% must be vanilla. 

Next, we are told that 90% of the vanilla chocolates are squashed. This means that 10% of the vanilla chocolates are not squashed. To calculate this, we take 10% of the 90% vanilla chocolates: 

\[
0.10 \times 90 = 9\% \text{ of the total chocolates}.
\]

Thus, 9% of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed. 

The correct answer is **D) 9%**.
