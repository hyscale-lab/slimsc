Okay, so I've got this problem here about chocolates in a store, and I'm supposed to figure out what percentage are both vanilla and not squashed. Let's see... I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question says all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored only. So, that

---------------

 means every chocolate is vanilla or cocoa, no other options. Got it.

It says 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored. Wait, so if 10% are cocoa, then the rest must be vanilla. Because all

---------------

 are either vanilla or cocoa. So vanilla would be 100% minus 10%, which is 90%. So 90% are vanilla.

But then it says 90% of the rest are squashed. Hmm, wait, what

---------------

's the "rest" referring to here? Let me parse that again. Oh, maybe the rest after considering the cocoa.

---------------

 So the rest would be the vanilla ones. So 90% of the vanilla chocolates are squashed.

Wait, that

---------------

 can't be right. Let me think again. The first part: 10% are cocoa, so 90% are vanilla. Then, 90% of the rest (the vanilla) are squashed. So,

---------------

 90% of 90% are squashed.

Wait, but wait. So the vanilla chocolates are 90% of the total. Out of those, 90% are squashed. So the percentage of vanilla and squashed would be 90% * 90% = 81% of the total chocolates. But

---------------

 the question is asking for vanilla and not squashed. So that's the opposite.

So if 90% of vanilla are squashed, then 10% of vanilla are not squashed. So 10% of 90% is 9% of the total.

Wait, wait

---------------

. Let me think. Let's model this with numbers to make it clearer. Let's assume there are 100 chocolates in total for simplicity.

Total chocolates = 100.

Cocoa flavored = 10% of 100 = 10 chocolates.

So vanilla flavored = 100 - 10 = 90 chocolates.

Now, 90% of the rest (which are the vanilla) are squashed. Wait, so

---------------

 90% of the vanilla are squashed. So 90% of 90 is 81. So 81 vanilla chocolates are squashed. So

---------------

 the remaining vanilla ones (not squashed) would be 90 - 81 = 9.

So 9 out of 100 chocolates are vanilla and not squashed. So that's 9%.

Looking at the options, option D is 9%, so that's the answer.

Wait, let me double-check. Another

---------------

 way to think: the problem says 90% of the rest are squashed. The rest after cocoa is vanilla, so 90% of vanilla are squashed. So squ

---------------

ashed vanilla is 81%, as above. So not squashed is 9% of total.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is D)9%.


To determine the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed, we analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Total Chocolates**: Assume there are 100 chocolates for simplicity.

2. **Cocoa Flavored**: 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored.  
   \[
   \text{Cocoa flavored} = 10\% \times 100 = 10 \text{ chocolates}.
   \]

3. **Vanilla Flavored**: Since all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa, the remaining 90% are vanilla flavored.  
   \[
   \text{Vanilla flavored} = 100 - 10 = 90 \text{ chocolates}.
   \]

4. **Squashed Chocolates**: 90% of the vanilla flavored chocolates are squashed.  
   \[
   \text{Squashed vanilla} = 90\% \times 90 = 81 \text{ chocolates}.
   \]

5. **Not Squashed Vanilla**: The remaining vanilla chocolates are not squashed.  
   \[
   \text{Not squashed vanilla} = 90 - 81 = 9 \text{ chocolates}.
   \]

6. **Percentage of Not Squashed Vanilla**:  
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \frac{9}{100} \times 100 = 9\%.
   \]

Thus, 9% of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed.
