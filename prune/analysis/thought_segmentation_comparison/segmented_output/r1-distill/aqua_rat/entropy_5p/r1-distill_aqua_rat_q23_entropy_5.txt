Okay, so I've got this problem here about figuring out the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students in a class. Hmm, let's see what the question says again.

Alright, the problem states that 1/16 of the students study math, 1/10 study bio, and 1/8 study english. The total number of students is a four-digit number. I need to find the difference between the maximum and minimum possible number of students. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Wait, so the total number of students must be such that when divided by 16, 10, and 8, each of these gives an integer,

---------------

 right? Because you can't have a fraction of a student. So the total number has to be a multiple of all these denominators. That

---------------

 makes me think about least common multiples (LCM).

Let me jot down the denominators: 16, 10, 8. So

---------------

 I need to find the LCM of these numbers. Breaking them down into prime factors:

- 16 is 2^4
- 10 is 2 * 5
- 8 is 2^3

The LCM would take the highest powers of all primes present. So for 2, the highest power is 4 (from 16), and for 5, it's 1. So LCM is 2^4 *5 = 16 *5 =80.

Wait, but wait. If

---------------

 the total number of students is a four-digit number, it must be a multiple of 80. So the total number N must satisfy N = 80k, where k is an integer, and N is between 1000 and 9999 inclusive.

So let

---------------

 me find the possible range for k. The smallest four-digit number is 1000, so 1000 <=

---------------

80k <=9999.

Divide 1000 by 80: 1000 /80 is 12.5. Since k must be an integer, the smallest k is 13, because 12.5 is not integer. 80*13=1040.

The

---------------

 largest four-digit number is 9999. 9999/80 is approximately 124.9875. So the maximum k is 124 because 124*80=9920. Next

---------------

 multiple would be 125*80=10000, which is a five-digit number, so too

---------------

 big.

So the possible N values are from 1040 (k=13) to 9920 (k=124). Now

---------------

, the minimum N is 1040, maximum is 9920. So the difference would be 9920 -1040 = 8880. Wait

---------------

, but that's option A. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm missing something. Because the question says the

---------------

 total number is a four-digit number, but perhaps N must be such that all the fractions result in whole numbers. But wait

---------------

, I thought that was already covered by N being a multiple of LCM(16,10,8)=80. So yeah

---------------

, N has to be a multiple of 80.

So the minimum N is 1040, maximum is 9920. Their difference is 8880. So the answer should be A)8880.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 8870. Hmm, did

---------------

 I make a calculation mistake? Let me recalculate the difference.

9920 minus 1040: 9920 - 1000 is 8920, but wait

---------------

, 1040 is 40 more than 1000. So 9920 -1040 = (9920 -1000) -40= 8920 -40=8880. So

---------------

 yeah, 8880 is correct.

Wait, but why is option B 8870? Did I m

---------------

iscalculate the maximum N?

Wait, let me double-check the maximum k. 124 *80 is 9920, which

---------------

 is correct because 124 *80 = (120*80)+(4*80)=9600 +320=9920. Then

---------------

 125 *80=10000, which is five digits, so correct.

So the maximum N is 9920, min is 1040. 9920-1040=8880. So the answer is A)8880.

But wait, why

---------------

 is option B 8870? Maybe I'm missing something else. Oh wait, perhaps the total number of students must

---------------

 also satisfy that the sum of the students in each subject is less than or equal to the total? No, because the problem doesn't state any overlap or

---------------

 constraints on the sum. So each subject's count is a fraction of the total, but their sum could be more than 100%, but that's allowed

---------------

 because students can study multiple subjects.

Wait, but maybe the problem is that the number of students in each subject must be an integer, which we've already considered

---------------

 by taking N as a multiple of 80. So I think my initial calculation is correct.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students in a class where the total number of students is a four-digit number. The problem

---------------

 states that:

- \( \frac{1}{16} \) of the students study math,
- \( \frac{1}{10} \) of the students study bio, and
- \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the students study English.

Since the number of students in each subject must be an integer, the total number of students \( N \) must be a multiple of the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 16, 10, and 8. 

### Step 1: Calculate the LCM of 16, 10, and 8
- Prime factorization:
  - \( 16 = 2^4 \),
  - \( 10 = 2 \times 5 \),
  - \( 8 = 2^3 \).
- The LCM is obtained by taking the highest power of each prime factor:
  \[
  \text{LCM} = 2^4 \times 5 = 16 \times 5 = 80.
  \]

Thus, \( N \) must be a multiple of 80.

### Step 2: Determine the range of \( N \)
The total number of students \( N \) is a four-digit number, so:
\[
1000 \leq N \leq 9999.
\]
Since \( N \) is a multiple of 80, we can write:
\[
N = 80k,
\]
where \( k \) is an integer. To find the range of \( k \):
\[
\frac{1000}{80} \leq k \leq \frac{9999}{80}.
\]
- \( \frac{1000}{80} = 12.5 \), so the smallest integer \( k \) is 13.
- \( \frac{9999}{80} \approx 124.9875 \), so the largest integer \( k \) is 124.

Thus, \( k \) ranges from 13 to 124, and the corresponding \( N \) values are:
\[
N_{\text{min}} = 80 \times 13 = 1040, \quad N_{\text{max}} = 80 \times 124 = 9920.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference
The difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is:
\[
N_{\text{max}} - N_{\text{min}} = 9920 - 1040 = 8880.
\]

### Final Answer
The difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is **8880**.
