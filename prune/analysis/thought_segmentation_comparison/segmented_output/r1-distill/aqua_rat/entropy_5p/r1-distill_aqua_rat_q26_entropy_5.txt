Okay, so I've got this question here about simple interest. Hmm, I remember that simple interest is calculated using the formula I = P * R * T, right? Where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest per annum, and T is the time in years.

The question says Rahul borrowed Rs. 500 at 6% per annum simple interest for 4 years. I need to find out how much he'll pay to clear the debt after 4 years. So, I think the total amount he'll pay is the principal plus the interest.

Let me break it down. The principal P is 500. The rate R is 6% per year. Wait, percentage

---------------

, so I should convert that to a decimal. 6% is 0.06. Time T is 4 years.

So first

---------------

, calculate the interest. I = P*R*T = 500 * 0.06 *4. Let me compute that. 500 * 0.06 is 30, and 30 multiplied by 4 is 120. So the interest is 120 rupees.

Then the total amount to pay back is principal plus interest. So 500 + 120 equals 620. Looking

---------------

 at the options, option C is 620. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to be sure. 500 multiplied by 0.06 is indeed 30. And 30 times 4 is 120. Yeah

---------------

, that's right. So adding that to the principal gives 620. So the answer should be option C.


To determine the total amount Rahul will pay to clear the debt, we use the simple interest formula:

\[
I = P \times R \times T
\]

Where:
- \( P = 500 \) (principal amount),
- \( R = 6\% = 0.06 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( T = 4 \) years (time).

First, calculate the interest:
\[
I = 500 \times 0.06 \times 4 = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

The total amount to be paid back is the sum of the principal and the interest:
\[
\text{Total Amount} = P + I = 500 + 120 = 620
\]

Thus, Rahul will pay Rs. 620 to clear the debt. The correct option is:
