Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about a jeep traveling a certain distance and then returning with an increased speed. We need to find out the distance it traveled. Hmm, right

---------------

, I remember that distance equals speed multiplied by time. 

Alright, let's break it down. The jeep goes forward and takes 6 hours. Let's say the speed during the forward journey is 'v' km/hr. So the distance it

---------------

 covers would be v multiplied by 6, right? So distance D = v * 6. 

Now, on the return journey, the jeep increases its speed by 12 km/hr. So the new speed is v + 12. And this time, the trip takes 4 hours. So the distance for the return trip would be (v + 12) multiplied by 4. But wait, the distance going and returning should be the same, right? Because it's the same path. So the

---------------

 distance in both cases is equal. 

So I can set up an equation: v * 6 = (v + 12) * 4. Let

---------------

 me write that out. 

6v = 4(v + 12). Now I need to solve for v. Let's expand the right side. 6v = 4v + 48. Hmm

---------------

, subtract 4v from both sides. That gives 2v = 48. Oh wait, dividing both sides by 2 gives v = 24 km/hr. 

So the original speed was 24 km/hr. Now, the distance would be speed multiplied by time, so 24 * 6. Let me calculate that. 24*6 is 144. So the distance is 144 km. 

Looking at the options, option B is 144 km. So the answer should be B. 

Wait a minute, did I make any mistakes? Let me double-check. The

---------------

 return speed is 24+12=36 km/hr. Time taken is 4 hours. So distance is 36 *4=144. Yep, same as before. So that

---------------

's consistent. 

I think that's correct. So the answer is 144 km, which is option B.


The jeep travels the same distance during both the forward and return journeys. Let the speed during the forward journey be \( v \) km/hr. The distance for the forward journey is \( D = v \times 6 \). During the return journey, the speed increases by 12 km/hr, making the return speed \( v + 12 \). The time taken for the return journey is 4 hours, so the distance is \( D = (v + 12) \times 4 \). Since the distances are equal, we set up the equation:

\[
6v = 4(v + 12)
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
6v = 4v + 48 \implies 2v = 48 \implies v = 24 \, \text{km/hr}
\]

The distance traveled is:

\[
D = v \times 6 = 24 \times 6 = 144 \, \text{km}
\]

This matches option B. Verifying, the return speed is \( 24 + 12 = 36 \, \text{km/hr} \), and the distance is \( 36 \times 4 = 144 \, \text{km} \), confirming consistency.
