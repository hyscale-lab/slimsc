Okay, so I have this problem about tires and costs, and I'm supposed to figure out the percentage difference in average cost per year between buying new tires and repairing the old ones. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says that new tires last for four years and cost $180 each. Alternatively, you can repair the current tires for $40 each, which adds one more year to their life. So I need to compare the average cost per year for both options.

Wait, let

---------------

 me make sure I understand. If the customer buys new tires, each tire lasts four years. So for each tire, the cost is $180 over four years. The

---------------

 other option is repairing the current tires for $40, which makes each last for an additional year. So if they repair, the tire now

---------------

 lasts five years? Or does it add one year each time you repair? Hmm, the question says a repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So if

---------------

 I repair, each tire will last one extra year beyond what it was before. But wait, I'm not sure what the original lifespan is. Oh, the problem says that when purchased new, they last four years. So the

---------------

 customer's current tires were probably already in use. But perhaps the question is considering whether to buy new or repair the existing ones. But

---------------

 for the sake of this problem, perhaps I should focus on the average cost per year for each option, regardless of the initial

---------------

 condition.

Let me clarify the options:

Option 1: Buy new tires at $180 each. Each tire lasts four years. So the cost is $180 for four years. So the average cost per year is 180 divided by 4.

Option 2: Repair current tires for $40 each. Each repair adds one year to their lifespan. Wait, but how many times would you repair? Or

---------------

 is each repair extending the life by one year each time? Or is the $40 repair a one-time thing, making each tire last an extra year?

---------------

 The question says, "a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year." So maybe each repair adds one year. So for the repair

---------------

 option, each repair costs $40 and adds one year. So how many repairs would you need?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think

---------------

 again. The problem says, when purchased new, they last four years. If you repair, the current tires can last for an additional year. So,

---------------

 the current tires are, I assume, already in use. So if you don't repair, how long do they last? Or

---------------

 perhaps the question is comparing the cost of replacing versus repairing, but I need to calculate the average cost per year for each scenario

---------------

.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the initial purchase. Let me read the problem again carefully.

The customer can choose to purchase new tires at $180 each, which last four years, or repair current tires at $40 each, which extends their life by one year. So the

---------------

 customer is probably looking to extend the life of their current tires or replace them. The question is about the average cost per year for each option.

Wait, but

---------------

 I need to find the average cost per year of the new tires versus the cost of repairing. So for the new tires, each tire is $180 and lasts four years. So the average cost per year is 180/4 = $45 per year.

For the repair option, each repair is $40 and adds one year. But how many times would you repair? Because

---------------

 if the current tires are already in use, perhaps they have some life left. Wait, but the problem states that the new tires last four years. The customer's current tires may

---------------

 have been used for some time already. But the problem doesn't specify how old the current tires are. So perhaps this is a general

---------------

 case where the customer is deciding between replacing or repairing, and the repair adds one year to their current tires. So the repair

---------------

 cost is $40 per tire, adding one year. But if you repair, how many times would you do that? Or

---------------

 is it a one-time repair?

Wait, maybe I should model this as: if you repair the current tires, each repair extends

---------------

 their life by one year. So if you repair once, the tire lasts one more year. But for this problem, perhaps the customer is considering whether

---------------

 to buy new tires (which last four years) or repair their current tires (which would last one more year). Wait, no, the problem says the

---------------

 repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So perhaps the current tires are about to fail, and a repair would give them one more year. Alternatively, if

---------------

 the current tires have, say, three years of life left, a repair would add one more year, making it four years?

---------------

 Or perhaps the repair adds one year regardless of their current state.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try

---------------

 to model each option's cost per year.

Option 1: Buy new tires. Each tire is $180 and lasts four years. So for

---------------

 each tire, the cost per year is 180/4 = 45 dollars per year.

Option 2: Repair the current tires. Each repair costs $40 and adds one year. But how many repairs? Wait

---------------

, perhaps the customer is looking to get the maximum use from their tires. So if a repair adds one year, and the

---------------

 new tires last four, maybe the repair is a one-time thing. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the repair is a

---------------

 one-time cost that extends the life by one year. So for each tire, the cost is $40, and it lasts

---------------

 one more year. So the total lifespan would be, say, four years if you repair once, or maybe the original lifespan plus one year. But without

---------------

 knowing the original lifespan, perhaps we can assume that the customer's current tires have some remaining life. Alternatively, perhaps the repair is done

---------------

 once, extending the life by one year. But I'm not getting enough information. 

Wait, perhaps the question is assuming

---------------

 that the customer's current tires are already in their third year or something. So buying new would give four years, and repairing would give an additional one year. But

---------------

 I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the cost per year for each option, irrespective of the current state

---------------

. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is comparing the cost for a four-year period. So if you buy new tires, you spend $180 and have them for four years. If

---------------

 you repair, you pay $40 and get an extra year, making it five years? No, because the problem says the repair adds one additional year. So perhaps

---------------

 the new tires last four years, and the repaired ones last five years.

Wait, but that might not be right. Let me read

---------------

 the problem again: "tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year."

So, the

---------------

 repair adds one year to the current tires. So if the customer's current tires are, say, two years old, a

---------------

 repair would make them last three more years? Or perhaps the repair adds one year to the current lifespan. But without knowing how old the tires are, perhaps the problem is considering

---------------

 the repair as a one-time cost, which extends the current tires' life by one year.

Wait, maybe the problem is more

---------------

 straightforward. Let me model it as: when you buy new tires, each tire is $180 and lasts four years. When you repair, each tire is $40 and lasts one additional year. So the

---------------

 repair gives you one more year of life for the tire.

But wait, the problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So perhaps the current tires are

---------------

 about to stop being usable, and a repair gives them one more year. So for a single tire, if you repair, you pay $40 and get one more year of use. Alternatively

---------------

, you can buy a new tire for $180 and have four years.

But the problem is about the average cost per year. So for the new tire, the average cost is 180 / 4 = 45 per year.

For the repair, the cost is 40 for one year. So the average cost per year is 40 / 1 = 40 per year.

Wait, that's possible

---------------

. So the new tires cost $45 per year, the repair option is $40 per year. The question is asking what percent greater is the new tire's average cost compared to the repair cost.

So, the formula

---------------

 for percentage increase is: [(New Cost - Repair Cost) / Repair Cost] * 100%.

So the difference is 45 - 40 = 5. So

---------------

 5 / 40 = 0.125, which is 12.5%. So the average cost per year of the new tires is 12.5% higher than the repair.

Looking at the options, C is 12.5%, which would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let

---------------

 me double-check. Did I model the repair correctly?

If the repair adds one year, and the cost is $40, then for that one year, the cost is $40. So the average per year is $40.



---------------

The new tire gives four years for $180, so 45 per year.

So 45 is what percent higher than 40? (

---------------

45-40)/40 *100 = 12.5%. Yep, that's correct.


To determine the percentage by which the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires, we analyze both options:

### Option 1: New Tires
- **Cost per tire**: $180  
- **Lifespan**: 4 years  
- **Average cost per year**:  
  \[
  \frac{180}{4} = 45 \, \text{dollars per year}
  \]

### Option 2: Repairing Current Tires
- **Cost per tire**: $40  
- **Additional lifespan**: 1 year  
- **Average cost per year**:  
  \[
  \frac{40}{1} = 40 \, \text{dollars per year}
  \]

### Percentage Difference
The question asks for the percentage by which the average cost of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires. The formula for percentage increase is:  
\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Cost} - \text{Repair Cost}}{\text{Repair Cost}} \right) \times 100\%
\]
Substituting the values:  
\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{45 - 40}{40} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{5}{40} \right) \times 100\% = 12.5\%
\]

Thus, the average cost per year of the new tires is **12.5% greater** than the cost of repairing the current tires.
