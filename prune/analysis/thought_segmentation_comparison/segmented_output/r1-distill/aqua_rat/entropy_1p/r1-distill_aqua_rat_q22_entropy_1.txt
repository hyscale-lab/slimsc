Okay, so I've got this problem about John and his tea. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on mixtures and concentrations, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, the problem says John has a 50% strong milk tea. So that means half of the tea is milk and the other half is, well, tea, right? Wait, no, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Wait, 

---------------

50% strong milk tea—I think that refers to the concentration of milk in the tea. So 50% milk and 50% tea. Because strong

---------------

 milk tea would have a higher concentration of milk, maybe, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe it's 50% milk in the tea. So the

---------------

 initial solution is 50% milk.

So, he replaces 15% of it with milk twice. Wait, does

---------------

 that mean he does it two times? Or is it replacing 15% each time? Let me read that again: he replaces 15% of it with milk twice. Hmm, maybe he does it two times, each time replacing 15% of the solution with milk. So each time, he's taking 15% of the current mixture and replacing it with pure milk.

Wait, but wait

---------------

, the first part says he replaces 15% of it with milk twice. So maybe that's two instances of replacing 15% each? Or maybe he replaces 15% each time, and does it twice. So,

---------------

 the first step is replacing 15% with milk, and then he does it again. Then, after that, he replaces 10% of the resultant solution with more milk.

So the process is:

1. Start with 50% milk tea.

2. Replace 15% of it with milk. Do this twice.

3. Then, replace 10% of the resultant solution with milk.

And we need to find the final concentration of tea. Wait, wait—concentration of tea? Or milk? Because the question says "the final concentration of tea John drinks." So we're looking for the percentage of tea left in the solution.

Wait, but wait

---------------

, because when you add milk, you're increasing the milk concentration and decreasing the tea concentration. So each time he replaces some of the mixture with milk, he's diluting the tea, right?

Hmm, let

---------------

 me think about each step.

Let's assume the initial volume is 100 units for simplicity. So 100 units of 50% milk tea. That's 50 units milk and 50 units tea.

First replacement: he replaces 15% of it with milk. So 15% of 100 units is 15 units. So he removes 15 units of the mixture and replaces it with 15 units of milk.

Wait, but when you replace a portion of the mixture, the amount of milk and tea removed depends on their current concentrations. So the first time, the mixture is 50% milk. So in the 15 units removed, there's 7.5 units of milk and 7.5 units of tea. Then he adds 15 units of milk.

So the new mixture

---------------

 after first replacement:

Milk: 50 -7.5 +15 = 57.5 units.

Tea: 50 -7.5 =42.5 units.

So the concentration of milk is 57.5 / 100 = 57.5%, tea is 42.5%.

Then he does this again: replaces 15% of the mixture with milk. So again, 15 units of the current mixture are removed and replaced with 15 units milk.

The current mixture is 57.5% milk. So in 15 units removed, the milk is 0.575 *15 =8.625 units, and tea is 15 -8.625=6.375 units.

So after replacement:

Milk: 57.5 -8.625 +15 = (57.5 +6.375) = 63.875 units.

Wait wait, no: 57.5 minus 8.625 is 48.875, plus 15 added gives

---------------

 63.875.

Tea: 42.5 -6.375 =36.125 units.

So now the mixture is 63.875 milk and 36.125 tea. So 63.875% milk, 36.125% tea.

Now, the third step: he replaces 10% of the resultant solution with more milk.

So 10% of 100 is 10 units. He removes 10 units of the current mixture and replaces it with 10 units milk.

Current concentration is 63.875% milk, so in 10 units removed, milk is 6.3875 units, tea is 3.6125 units.

After replacement:

Milk: 63.875 -6.3875 +10 = (63.875 + 3.6125) =67.4875? Wait, wait no.

Wait, 63.875 -6.3875 = 57.4875. Then adding 10 units milk: 57.4875 +10=67.4875 units milk.

Tea: 36.125 -3.6125 =32.5125 units.

So total volume is still 100 units.

So the concentration of tea is 32.5125% /100 =32.5125%.

Looking at the options, option E is 32.51%. So that's the closest.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations, because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

First step: Initial 50% milk.

After first replacement (15% with milk):

Milk: 50 - (0.15 *50) + 0.15*100 = 50 -7.5 +15 =57.5.

Tea: 50 -7.5=42.5.

Second replacement: 15% of 100 is 15 units.

Milk in removed: 0.575 *15=8.625.

So milk becomes 57.5 -8.625 +15 =63.875.

Tea becomes 42.5 - (15 -8.625) =42.5-6.375=36.125.

Third step: 10% of 100 is 10 units.

Milk in removed: 0.63875 *10=6.3875.

So milk becomes 63.875 -6.3875 +10=67.4875.

Tea becomes 36.125 - (10 -6.3875)=36.125 -3.6125=32.5125.

So 32.5125% tea, which is about 32.51%, matching option E.


To determine the final concentration of tea in John's drink, we analyze the process step by step:

1. **Initial Setup**: John starts with 100 units of a 50% milk tea solution. This means 50 units are milk and 50 units are tea.

2. **First Replacement**: John replaces 15% of the solution with milk. Since the mixture is 50% milk, 15% of 100 units (15 units) contains 7.5 units of milk and 7.5 units of tea. After removing these and adding 15 units of milk:
   - Milk: \( 50 - 7.5 + 15 = 57.5 \, \text{units} \)
   - Tea: \( 50 - 7.5 = 42.5 \, \text{units} \)
   The new concentrations are 57.5% milk and 42.5% tea.

3. **Second Replacement**: John repeats the process, replacing another 15% of the solution with milk. The mixture is now 57.5% milk, so 15 units removed contain \( 0.575 \times 15 = 8.625 \, \text{units} \) of milk and \( 15 - 8.625 = 6.375 \, \text{units} \) of tea. After removing these and adding 15 units of milk:
   - Milk: \( 57.5 - 8.625 + 15 = 63.875 \, \text{units} \)
   - Tea: \( 42.5 - 6.375 = 36.125 \, \text{units} \)
   The new concentrations are 63.875% milk and 36.125% tea.

4. **Third Replacement**: John replaces 10% of the solution with milk. The mixture is now 63.875% milk, so 10 units removed contain \( 0.63875 \times 10 = 6.3875 \, \text{units} \) of milk and \( 10 - 6.3875 = 3.6125 \, \text{units} \) of tea. After removing these and adding 10 units of milk:
   - Milk: \( 63.875 - 6.3875 + 10 = 67.4875 \, \text{units} \)
   - Tea: \( 36.125 - 3.6125 = 32.5125 \, \text{units} \)
   The final concentrations are 67.4875% milk and 32.5125% tea.

Thus, the final concentration of tea is approximately **32.51%**, which matches option **E**.
