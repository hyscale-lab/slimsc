Okay, so I've got this problem here about a train journey, and I need to figure out the total duration. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, let's see.

The problem says the train is running at 100 miles per hour and takes 10 hours to reach its destination. So wait, if it's going at 100 mph for the entire trip and it takes 10 hours, I can probably find the total distance first. Oh right, because distance equals speed multiplied by time. So distance D is 100 mph * 10 hours = 1000 miles. That makes sense.

But then, after covering a quarter of the distance, it starts raining, and the train slows down to 75 mph. So I need to calculate how long the journey takes in two parts: the first quarter and the remaining three quarters.

Let me think about the first part. A quarter of the distance is 1000 miles divided by 4. So that's 250 miles. The train is going at 100 mph for this part. Time is distance divided by speed, so 250 miles / 100 mph = 2.5 hours. That's straightforward.

Now the second part is the remaining three quarters, which is 750 miles. But the speed drops to 75 mph. So time for this part is 750 miles divided by 75 mph. Let me do that calculation. 750 divided by 75 is 10 hours. Oh wait, that's interesting because the original total time was 10 hours. But wait, now the second part alone is taking 10 hours, which is more than the original time. So the total time must be longer than 10 hours.

So adding the two times together: 2.5 hours + 10 hours = 12.5 hours. So the total journey duration is 12.5 hours. Looking at the options, option C is 12.5. So that should be the answer.

Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. The distance is 1000 miles, correct. A quarter is 250 miles, first

---------------

 part at 100 mph: 250 / 100 = 2.5. Then 750 miles at 75 mph: 750 /75=10. Yes, that adds up to 12.5. So yeah, the answer should be C.


The train travels at 100 mph for the first quarter of the journey, which is 250 miles, taking 2.5 hours. For the remaining 750 miles, it slows to 75 mph, taking 10 hours. Adding these times gives a total journey duration of 12.5 hours.
