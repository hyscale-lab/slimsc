Okay, let's see. I have this problem where I need to find the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students in a class, given some fractions. The total number is a four-digit number. Hmm.

So, the problem states that 1/16 study math, 1/10 study bio, and 1/8 study English. Wait, but wait

---------------

 a minute—those fractions might not be the only students. Or do they? The question doesn't specify whether these are the only students or if there are overlaps. Oh, wait, the

---------------

 question is about the number of students studying each subject, but I think it's more about the total number of students being a four-digit number that's a multiple of the denominators of

---------------

 these fractions because the number of students in each subject has to be an integer.

Oh right! So, the total number of students, let's call it N, must be such that N is divisible by 16, 10, and 8. Because 1/16 of them must be an integer, same for 1/10 and 1/8.

So N has to be a common multiple of 16, 10, and 8. To find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers, right?

Let me break them down into their prime factors.

16 is 2^4.
10 is 2 * 5.
8 is 2^3.

The LCM would take the highest power of each prime. So for 2, the highest power is 4 (from 16). For 5, it's 5^1 (from 10). So LCM = 2^4 *5 = 16*5=80.

So N must be a multiple of 80. But N is a four-digit number. So the smallest four-digit number divisible by 80 is the smallest N ≥1000, and the largest is the largest N ≤9999.

Wait, let

---------------

's find the minimum possible N. The smallest four-digit number is 1000. But is 1000 divisible by 80? Let me check: 1000 divided by 80 is 12.5. Oh no, not an integer. So the next multiple would be 80 *13 = 1040. Because 12*80=960, which is three-digit. So the minimum N is 1040.

Now the maximum four-digit N divisible by 80. The largest four-digit number is 9999. Let's see what's the largest multiple of 80 less than or equal to 9999. 9999 divided by 80 is 124.9875. So the integer part is 124, so 124*80=9920. So the maximum N is 9920.

Wait, wait. But wait, 80 *125 is 10,000, which is a five-digit number. So yes, 9920 is the maximum.

Now, the problem asks for the difference between the maximum and minimum N. So 9920 - 1040 = ?

Let me calculate that: 9920 -1040. Hmm, 9920 minus 1000 is 8920, then plus 40 (since it's minus 1040, which is 1000+40). Wait, no, 9920 -1040 = 9920 - (1000 +40) = (9920-1000) -40 = 8920 -40 = 8880.

Wait, so the difference is 8880.

Looking at the options, option A is 8880.

But wait, let me double-check if I did

---------------

 everything correctly. Because sometimes I might have missed something.

Wait, the question is about the difference between maximum and minimum number of students, right? So N

---------------

 is the total, which must be a multiple of 80, four digits. So min N is 1040, max N is 9920. Difference is 8880.

So the correct answer is option A: 8880.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students in a class, given that the total number of students is a four-digit number and satisfies the conditions:

1. \( \frac{1}{16} \) of the students study math.
2. \( \frac{1}{10} \) of the students study bio.
3. \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the students study English.

For the number of students in each subject to be an integer, the total number of students \( N \) must be divisible by the denominators of the given fractions, i.e., 16, 10, and 8. The least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers is calculated as follows:

- Prime factorization:
  - \( 16 = 2^4 \),
  - \( 10 = 2 \cdot 5 \),
  - \( 8 = 2^3 \).
- The LCM is obtained by taking the highest power of each prime:
  - \( \text{LCM} = 2^4 \cdot 5 = 16 \cdot 5 = 80 \).

Thus, \( N \) must be a multiple of 80. Since \( N \) is a four-digit number, we find the smallest and largest four-digit multiples of 80:

- The smallest four-digit multiple of 80 is \( 1040 \) (since \( 80 \times 13 = 1040 \)).
- The largest four-digit multiple of 80 is \( 9920 \) (since \( 80 \times 124 = 9920 \)).

The difference between the maximum and minimum values of \( N \) is:

\[
9920 - 1040 = 8880
\]

Thus, the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is **8880**.
