Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the maximum distance I can travel with $8.50 in a cab. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile. Oh right, and then 10 cents for each additional quarter mile. Oh wait, so the initial charge covers the first quarter-mile, and every bit beyond that is 10 cents per quarter-mile. So I need to figure out how much money is left after the first charge and then see how many more quarter-miles I can add.

Wait, my total money is $8.50. The first part is $3.50, so subtracting that from 8.50 gives me the remaining money. Let me calculate that: 8.50 minus 3.50 is 5.00. So I have $5 left.

Each additional quarter-mile is 10 cents. Since it's 10 cents per quarter-mile, I can find out how many of those I can buy with $5. Oh

---------------

 wait, but I should convert that to the same units. So $5 is 500 cents, right? Because a dollar is 100 cents, so 5 times 100 is 500. And each quarter-mile is 10 cents, so how many times does 10 cents go into 500 cents? That's 500 divided by 10, which is 50. So I can go 50 more quarter-miles.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait

---------------

. No, because the first quarter-mile is already included. So the initial 3.50 covers the first quarter-mile. Then each additional is 0.10 dollars (10 cents) for a quarter-mile. So the 5 dollars would get me 5 / 0.10 = 50 more quarter-miles. So total distance is the first quarter-mile plus 50 quarter-miles.

So,

---------------

 first quarter is 0.25 miles. Then 50 times 0.25 miles. Let's calculate that. 50 * 0.25 is 12.5 miles. So adding the first quarter, 0.25 + 12.5 is 12.75 miles. Wait, but wait a second, I

---------------

 think I might be making a mistake here. Because the initial charge is for the first quarter-mile, and then each subsequent is 10 cents. So the total distance is 1 (for the first) + 50 (from the remaining money) quarter-miles. So 1 +50 is 51 quarter-miles. Each

---------------

 quarter-mile is 0.25 miles. So 51 * 0.25 is 12.75 miles. That seems right.

But wait, let me double-check the math. The

---------------

 total money is $8.50. After paying $3.50, I have $5 left. Each additional 0.25 miles costs $0.10. So the number of additional quarter-miles is 5 / 0.10 = 50. So 50 quarter-miles. So total distance is 1 +50 = 51 quarter-miles. 51 * 0.25 is 12.75 miles. So that's 12.75 miles total.

Looking at the options, option B is 12.75. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes

---------------

, cab fares might round up to the next quarter-mile. But the problem doesn't mention any such rounding, so I think we can assume that each quarter-mile is charged exactly. So I

---------------

 don't have to worry about partial quarters. So the calculation should be straightforward.

So yeah, the maximum distance is 12.75 miles, which is option B.


To calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 in a cab, start by subtracting the initial charge of $3.50 for the first quarter-mile from the total amount. This leaves $5.00 for additional travel. Each additional quarter-mile costs 10 cents, so divide the remaining $5.00 by $0.10 to determine how many additional quarter-miles can be purchased: 

\[
\frac{5.00}{0.10} = 50 \, \text{quarter-miles}.
\]

The total distance is the sum of the first quarter-mile and the additional 50 quarter-miles:

\[
1 \, \text{quarter-mile} + 50 \, \text{quarter-miles} = 51 \, \text{quarter-miles}.
\]

Convert quarter-miles to miles by multiplying by 0.25:

\[
51 \times 0.25 = 12.75 \, \text{miles}.
\]

Thus, the maximum distance you can travel is **12.75 miles**, which corresponds to option B.
