Okay, so I've got this question here about simple interest. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says Rahul borrowed Rs. 500 at 6% per annum simple interest. I need to find out how much he'll pay after 4 years. The options are A to E, but I'll focus on the calculation first.

Wait, I remember that simple interest is calculated using the formula: I = P * R * T. Where P is principal, R is rate of interest, and T is time in years. So the interest each year is just 6% of 500. Let me compute that.

P is 500. R is 6%, which is 0.06 in decimal. T is 4 years. So I = 500 * 0.06 * 4. Let me calculate that. 500 multiplied by 0.06 is 30. Then, 30 multiplied by 4 is 120. So the total interest over four years is Rs. 120.

Now, the total amount to pay back is the principal plus the interest. So 500 plus 120 is 620. Let me check the options. Option C is 620. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I remember

---------------

 the formula correctly? Oh right, simple interest is calculated only on the principal, not on the accumulated interest. So yeah, each year it's 6% of 500, which is 30 per year. Over four years, that's 30*4=120. So total amount is 500+120=620. So the answer should be option C.

Looking at the options again: A is 750, which seems way too high. B is 700, also higher than our calculation. C is 620, which matches. D is 600, which would be if the interest was 100, but that's not the case here. So the only correct option is C.


To determine the total amount Rahul will pay to clear the debt after 4 years, we use the simple interest formula:

\[
I = P \times R \times T
\]

Where:
- \( P = 500 \) (principal amount),
- \( R = 6\% = 0.06 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( T = 4 \) years.

Substituting the values:

\[
I = 500 \times 0.06 \times 4 = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

The total interest over 4 years is Rs. 120. Adding this to the principal:

\[
\text{Total Amount} = P + I = 500 + 120 = 620
\]

Thus, Rahul will pay Rs. 620 to clear the debt. Among the options, the correct answer is:
