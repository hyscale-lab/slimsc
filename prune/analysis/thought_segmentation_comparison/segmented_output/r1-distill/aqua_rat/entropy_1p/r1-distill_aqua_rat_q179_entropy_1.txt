Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and think through it step by step. 

The question is about Ace Book Company's sales revenue. Last year, 34% of their sales came from novels. Then, of the remaining revenue, 1/3 was from biographies. They're asking how many times the revenue from novels is compared to biographies. The options are A)1.3, B)1.5, C)2.1, D)2.5, E)3.1.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I think I should consider the total revenue as a whole, maybe 100% to make the percentages easier to work with. So if the total revenue is 100%, 34% is from novels. That leaves the remaining 66% for other stuff.

Of that remaining 66%, 1/3 comes from biographies. So I need to find out what 1/3 of 66% is. Let me calculate that. 66 divided by 3 is 22, so biographies make up 22% of the total revenue.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. No

---------------

, that's not right. Because the 1/3 is of the remaining revenue, not of the total. So the remaining revenue after novels is 66%, and 1/3 of that is biographies. So 1/3 of 66% is indeed 22%, so

---------------

 the biographies are 22% of the total revenue.

So the revenue from novels is 34%, and from biographies, it's 22%. They want to know how many times the novel revenue is compared to biographies. So I need to find the ratio of novels to biographies.

That would be 34 divided by 22. Let me do that calculation. 34 divided by 22 is... let's see. 22 times 1 is 22, subtract that from 34, we

---------------

 get 12. Bring down a zero: 120. 22 goes into 120 five times because 22 times 5 is 110. Subtract, we get 10. Bring down another zero: 100. 22 goes into 100 four times (22*4=88). Subtract, 12 again. Wait, this is starting to repeat. So 34 divided by 22 is 1.545454... approximately 1.545.

Looking at the options, the closest one is option C) 2.1? Wait, no. Wait, option B is 1.5, option C is 2.1. Wait, 1.545 is approximately 1.55, which is closer to 1.5 than 2.1. Or wait, perhaps

---------------

 I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 34 divided by 22. Let me calculate that again. 34 ÷ 22.

Alternatively, 34 ÷ 22 = (34 ÷ 11) ÷ 2 = (3.09) ÷ 2 ≈ 1.545. So that's correct. So about 1.545 times.

Looking at the options, option B is 1.5, which is pretty close. But wait, none

---------------

 of the options is exactly 1.545. The options are A)1.3, B)1.5, C)2.1, D)2.5, E)3.1.

Wait, but

---------------

 perhaps I misread the question. Let me go back. The question says, "the company's revenue from the sale of novels was approximately, how many times its revenue from the sale of biographies?" So that's novels / biographies. So 34% divided by (1/3 of the remaining 66%). Wait, wait, perhaps I should think

---------------

 in terms of fractions without percentages. Maybe that's where I went wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the total revenue as a variable, say, R. Then, the revenue from novels is 0.34 R. The remaining revenue is 0.66 R. Of that, 1/3 is from biographies, so that's (1/3)*0.66 R = 0.22 R. So the ratio is 0.34 R / 0.22 R = 34/22 = same as before, 1.545.

So the answer should be approximately 1.545, which is roughly 1.5. So option B is 1.5. But wait, looking

---------------

 at the options, option B is 1.5, which is 3/2. Hmm, 1.5 is 3/2, but 34/22 is 17/11, which is approximately 1.545. So 17/11 is about 1.545, which is about 1.55.

But none of the options is 1.55. So perhaps the problem expects me to compute it as 34 / (1/3 * (100-34)).



---------------

Wait, no, that's what I did. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the company's revenue from novels is 34%, and the revenue from biographies is (1/3) of the remaining 66%, which is 22%. So the ratio is 34 / 22, which is 1.545, approximately 1.55. So the options are:

A)1.3 → 1.3
B)1.5 → 1.5
C)2.1 → 2.1
D)2.5 → 2.5
E)3.1 → 3.1

So 1.55 is closer to option B)1.5, but wait, perhaps

---------------

 I made a mistake in my initial approach. Maybe I should compute the ratio differently.

Wait, another way: perhaps the question

---------------

 is asking how many times the revenue from novels is compared to biographies. So if I have R as the total revenue, then:

Novels: 0.34 R

Biographies: (1/3) * (R - 0.34 R) = (1/3)(0.66 R) = 0.22 R.

So the ratio is (0.34 R) / (0.22 R) = 34/22 = 17/11 ≈ 1.545.

So the closest

---------------

 option is B)1.5, but wait, perhaps the question is asking the opposite. Did I get the ratio right? Because if it's novels compared to biographies, it's 34/(1/3 * 66) = 34 / 22 = 1.545.

Alternatively, if the problem had said "how many times more"

---------------

 then sometimes people get confused. For example, if something is twice as much, it's 2 times. But in this case, 1.545 is about 1.5 times, so option B.

Wait, but looking

---------------

 at the options again, the first option is 1.3, which is lower than 1.5, then 1.5, then 2.1. So 1.5 is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute

---------------

 it as 34/(1/3 * (100-34)). Let me compute that numerically.

34 divided by ( (1/3) * 66 ) → 34 / 22 ≈ 1.545.

So the

---------------

 answer is approximately 1.55, which is about 1.5. So option B.

Wait, but wait

---------------

, another possibility: perhaps the question is asking for the number of times the revenue from novels is compared to the revenue from biographies, which is the same as (revenue novels)/(revenue biographies) = 34 / 22 ≈ 1.545.

So the closest option is B)1.5.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider

---------------

 the exact value. 34/22 is 17/11. 17 divided by 11 is approximately 1.545, which is about 1.55.

Looking at the options, none is exactly 1.55, but the options are A)1.3, B)1.5, C)2.1, D)2.5, E)3.1.

So 1.5 is the closest, so B is the answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because 1.55 is between 1.5 and 2.1. But 1.55 is much closer to 1.5 than to 2.1. The difference between 1.55 and 1.5 is 0.05, while the difference to 2.1 is 0.55. So definitely, 1.5 is the closest.

But wait, the

---------------

 options don't have 1.55. So the correct answer is option B)1.5.


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given data. Ace Book Company's total revenue is considered as 100%. Last year, 34% of this revenue came from the sale of novels. The remaining revenue is 100% - 34% = 66%. Of this remaining 66%, 1/3 was from the sale of biographies. 

To find the percentage of total revenue from biographies, we calculate:

\[
\text{Revenue from biographies} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66\% = 22\%.
\]

Next, we need to determine how many times the revenue from novels is compared to the revenue from biographies. This requires finding the ratio of the revenue from novels to the revenue from biographies:

\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Revenue from novels}}{\text{Revenue from biographies}} = \frac{34\%}{22\%}.
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\frac{34}{22} \approx 1.545.
\]

This value is approximately 1.545. Among the given options, the closest value to 1.545 is **1.5**. Therefore, the revenue from novels is approximately 1.5 times the revenue from biographies.
