Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says there are 200 students in total. At least 45% attended the prom night, and at least 35% took part in the debating session. I need to find the maximum number who didn't go to either. Hmm, okay

---------------

.

Let me first convert those percentages into actual numbers. 45% of 200 is... 45/100 * 200 = 90 students. So, at least 90 attended the prom. Similarly, 35% of 200 is 70 students. So, at least 70 were in the debate.

Wait, so the question is about finding the maximum number who didn't attend either. So, to maximize the number of students who didn't attend either event, I want to minimize the number who did attend at least one of them. But how?

Oh right, because if more students went to prom or debate, fewer would be left out. So to maximize the 'neither' group, I need to minimize the number of students who attended at least one event. But how do I do that when there are overlapping attendees?

Hmm. So

---------------

, the principle here is the inclusion-exclusion principle. The number of students who attended prom or debate is equal to the number who attended prom plus the number who attended debate minus the number who attended both. Because if some attended both, they're being counted twice when you add the two, so you subtract them once.

So, the formula is: |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|

In this case, |A| is 90 (prom attendees), |B| is 70 (debate attendees). We want to find the minimum possible |A ∪ B|, because that would leave the maximum number of students outside both.

Wait, but

---------------

 how? Because if we minimize |A ∪ B|, that would leave more students in neither. So, to minimize |A ∪ B|, I need to maximize the overlap between A and B. Because when |A ∩ B| is as large as possible, |A ∪ B| becomes as small as possible.

So, the maximum possible |A ∩ B| can't be more than the smaller of |A| and |B|. Since

---------------

 |A| is 90 and |B| is 70, the maximum possible overlap is 70. Because you can't have more people in both events than the number who attended each individual event.

Wait, but

---------------

 wait a second. Let me think. If all 70 debate attendees also went to prom, then the total number who attended at least one would be 90 + 70 - 70 = 90. So, |A ∪ B| would be 90. Then the number of students who didn't attend either would be 200 - 90 = 110. But wait, 110 is one of the options, option E. But wait, can that be the case?

Wait, but hold on. The problem states that at least 45% attended prom and at least 35% debated. So, if more than 70 attended both, would

---------------

 that violate any conditions? Wait, no, because the minimums are 90 and 70. So, if all 70 in debate also went to prom, that's allowed. But wait

---------------

, what if the overlap is more than 70? No, because the number in the debate is 70. So the maximum possible overlap is 70.

So, in that case, the total number in prom or debate is 90, so 200 - 90 = 110. So the maximum number who neither attended prom nor debate would be 110, which is option E.

Wait a minute, but wait

---------------

. Let me double-check. If the overlap is 70, that's the maximum possible. So, 90 + 70 -70 =90 in at least one. So, 200-90=110. That makes sense. But the options are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110.

So, E

---------------

 is 110. So that's the maximum. But wait, the question says "at least 45% attended prom" which is 90, and "at least 35%" is 70. So, the

---------------

 minimums are 90 and 70. So, the maximum number of students who could have neither is when the number of students attending at least one is minimized.

Wait, but wait

---------------

 another thing. If we have more people in both, then the union is smaller. So, that's correct. So, if I have maximum overlap, the union is as small as possible. So, in that case, 90+70-70=90. So, the union is 90, which leaves 110.



---------------

But wait, another way to think about it: the minimal number of students who attended either event is the sum of the two minimums minus the total number of students, but that might not apply here. Wait, no. Wait, no

---------------

, the inclusion-exclusion gives the minimal |A ∪ B| as max(|A| + |B| - N, 0), where N is the total. Hmm, let

---------------

 me think.

Wait, actually, the minimal possible |A ∪ B| is when their overlap is as large as possible, which would be |A| + |B| - N if that's positive. Wait, no, that

---------------

 would give the minimal |A ∪ B| as |A| + |B| - N, but if that's negative, it can't be, because you can't have a negative union.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I should think in terms of maximum possible overlap.

Wait, the maximum possible overlap is the minimum of |A| and |B|. So, in

---------------

 this case, min(90,70)=70.

So, |A ∪ B| = 90 +70 -70=90.

So, the number of students not in either is 200 -90=110.

So, E is the correct answer.

But wait, let

---------------

 me consider another approach. Suppose I have 90 in prom and 70 in debate. What's the minimal possible number in the union?

The minimal number of students in the union is when the overlap is as big as possible. So, that would be when all 70 debate attendees also attended prom. So, in that case, the union is 90. So, 200-90=110.

So, the maximum number of students who neither attended prom nor debate is 110.

But wait, why

---------------

 is that one of the options? Let me check the options again.

Options are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110.

Yes, E is 110.

Wait, but wait another thing. The

---------------

 problem says "at least 45% attended prom" and "at least 35% debated." So, what

---------------

 if more than 90 attended prom, and more than 70 debated? Then, the number of students who attended either would be larger, leaving fewer who didn't attend either. But we're trying to find the maximum number who could have neither, so that would require the minimal number attending either.

Ah, right. So, to find the maximum 'neither' group, we need the minimal 'either' group. Which occurs when the overlap is maximum, i.e., when as many as possible of the 70 debate attendees were also in prom.

So, that would give

---------------

 us 90 in prom (since 90 is the minimum required for prom) and 70 in debate, with all 70 in both. So, the union is 90, so

---------------

 200-90=110.

So, the answer should be E)110.


To determine the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session, we start by analyzing the given data:

1. **Total number of students**: 200.  
2. **Minimum number of prom attendees**: At least 45% of 200, which is \( 0.45 \times 200 = 90 \).  
3. **Minimum number of debate attendees**: At least 35% of 200, which is \( 0.35 \times 200 = 70 \).  

To maximize the number of students who neither attended the prom nor the debate, we need to minimize the number of students who attended at least one of the events. This can be achieved by maximizing the overlap between the two groups (students who attended both events).  

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:  
\[
|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|
\]  
Here, \( |A| = 90 \) (prom attendees), \( |B| = 70 \) (debate attendees), and \( |A \cap B| \) is the overlap. To minimize \( |A \cup B| \), \( |A \cap B| \) must be as large as possible. The maximum possible overlap is limited by the smaller of \( |A| \) and \( |B| \), which is 70.  

Substituting these values:  
\[
|A \cup B| = 90 + 70 - 70 = 90
\]  
Thus, the number of students who attended at least one event is 90. The number of students who neither attended the prom nor the debate is:  
\[
200 - |A \cup B| = 200 - 90 = 110
\]  

Therefore, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is **110**.
