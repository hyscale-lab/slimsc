Okay, so I've got this question here about finding the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers. The question is asking how many letters need to be distinct. Hmm, wait, no, actually, I think I misread. Let me read it again. Oh right, the question is to

---------------

 find the total number of distinct bike numbers, given that they consist of 2 letters followed by 2 numbers. And the options are given as A to E.

Wait, the question

---------------

 is a bit ambiguous. It says, "How many letters need to be distinct?" Oh, wait, no, wait, no. Let me read the question again. Oh, no, the actual question is to find the total number of distinct bike numbers. Oh, and

---------------

 the part in the parentheses says, "How many letters need to be distinct?" Maybe that's a typo or a misphrasing. Or

---------------

 perhaps the question is, given that the letters must be distinct, find the total number.

Wait, I think I need to clarify. The question

---------------

 is: Find the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers. How many letters need to be distinct?

Wait, maybe the question is ph

---------------

rased as: How many letters need to be distinct when forming the bike numbers? Or perhaps the letters must be distinct, and the numbers can be anything. Hmm, I

---------------

'm a bit confused now.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is to find the total number of distinct bike numbers, considering whether the two letters must be distinct or not. So

---------------

, for example, if the letters are allowed to repeat, the count would be different than if they have to be unique.

Wait, looking at the options, the numbers are in the tens of thousands, which suggests that the letters and numbers are allowed

---------------

 to have repeats. So maybe the letters don't need to be distinct, and the numbers don't need to be distinct either. Or perhaps the letters are required to be distinct, but the numbers can be the same.

Wait, perhaps the problem is:

---------------

 when forming the bike number, the two letters must be distinct, and the two numbers can be anything. Or maybe the letters can be the same, but the numbers can be anything. Or

---------------

 maybe both letters and numbers have to be distinct.

Wait, I need to figure out the problem correctly. Let's parse the question again: "Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?"

Hmm, perhaps the question is asking

---------------

, given that the bike numbers are formed as two letters followed by two numbers, how many letters need to be distinct? Or maybe the letters must be distinct, and we have to compute the total possibilities.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: the problem is about permutations with repetition. So, bike numbers have two letters followed by two digits.

Assuming that letters can be any from the English alphabet, but

---------------

 perhaps uppercase only. Let's assume 26 letters, uppercase. And the numbers are digits 0-9, so 10 possibilities each.

But the question is about whether the letters need to be distinct. So if letters can repeat, then each letter has 26 options, so 26 *26 for the letters. If letters must be distinct, then the first letter has 26 options, the second has 25, so 26*25.

Same with the numbers: if they can repeat, each has 10 options, so 10*10. If they must be distinct, 10*9.

But the question is phrased as "how many letters need to be distinct?" which is a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is:

---------------

 "Find the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers. How many letters need to be distinct?" which

---------------

 might imply that the letters must be distinct, and we have to compute the total number.

Wait, but perhaps the question is ph

---------------

rased in a way that it's asking for the total number of possible bike numbers, given that the letters are distinct. Or maybe it's asking, given

---------------

 that the letters must be distinct, what is the total number of possible bike numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the letters can be the same, but the question is how many letters need to be distinct to

---------------

 form a bike number. Hmm, that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the letters need to be distinct, and the numbers can be anything. So, the letters are distinct, but the numbers can repeat.

So the total would be:

Letters: first letter has 26 options, second has 25 (since distinct), so 26 *25.

Numbers: each digit can be 0-9, so 10 options each. So 10 *10.

Total combinations: (26*25) * (10*10) = 26*25*100.

Let me compute that:

26 *25 is 650.

650 *100 = 65,000.

Looking at the options, option D is 65000.

Alternatively, if the letters don't have to be distinct, the letters would be 26 *26 = 676, numbers 10*10=100, total 676 *100=67,600. But that's not one of the options. So perhaps the letters must be distinct.

Wait, the options don't have 67600. So in

---------------

 that case, the correct answer is 65000, which is option D.

But wait, the question says "how many letters need to be distinct?" which

---------------

 is a bit confusing. Maybe it's asking how many letters are needed to be distinct in the formation of the bike numbers. But

---------------

 in this context, perhaps it's about the number of distinct letters used across all possible bike numbers, which would be a different question. But that doesn't seem to fit with the options given.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking

---------------

 for the number of possible bike numbers where the two letters are distinct. Then the total would be 26 *25 *10 *10=65,000, which is option D.

So the correct answer is D.


To determine the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers, we analyze the problem as follows:

1. **Letters**: There are 26 letters in the English alphabet. If the letters must be distinct, the first letter has 26 options, and the second letter has 25 options (since it cannot repeat the first). Thus, the number of possible combinations for the letters is:
   \[
   26 \times 25 = 650
   \]

2. **Numbers**: There are 10 digits (0-9). Since the numbers can repeat, each digit has 10 options. Thus, the number of possible combinations for the numbers is:
   \[
   10 \times 10 = 100
   \]

3. **Total Combinations**: The total number of distinct bike numbers is the product of the number of letter combinations and the number of number combinations:
   \[
   650 \times 100 = 65,000
   \]

Given the options, the correct answer is **65,000**, which corresponds to option D.
