Okay, so I have this problem about finding the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers. The question is asking how many letters need to be distinct. Wait, no, actually, wait. Let me read the question again. Oh, wait, the first part is the question, and the second part is the options. Wait, no, the question is: "Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?" Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the question is ph

 of the problem. Oh wait, the options are numerical, so perhaps the first part is the actual question, and the second part is an option. No, wait, looking back, the question is:

---------------

 "Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?" So, maybe it's a two-part question? No, perhaps the question

 is to find the total number of distinct bike numbers, given that the letters must be distinct, or perhaps not. Wait, perhaps the wording is a bit unclear. Wait, the first

 part is the main question, and the second part is asking if the letters need to be distinct.

Wait, perhaps the actual problem is: "Find the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers. How many letters need to be distinct?" Or perhaps it's a

 translation issue. Maybe the question is: "Find the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers. How many letters need to be distinct?" Or perhaps, it's about

---------------

 whether the letters must be distinct or not, but the way the options are given (like 74453, etc.) suggests that the first part is the main question, and the options are the possible answers to that.

Wait, perhaps the question is simply: "Find the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers. How many letters need to be distinct?" But that seems a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is: "Find the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers. How many letters are needed to be distinct?" So maybe the letters have to be distinct, and the numbers can have duplicates.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think

---------------

 about the standard approach. Normally, when creating license plates or bike numbers, each character can be used more than once unless specified otherwise. So, if

---------------

 the problem says "using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers," the default assumption is that letters and numbers can repeat unless stated otherwise.

Wait, but the question is ph

---------------

rased as: "How many letters need to be distinct?" So perhaps the problem is asking for the number of possible combinations when the letters are distinct. Or maybe the problem is asking

---------------

 for the number of possible bike numbers when the letters are distinct.

Wait, perhaps the question is: "Find the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers, with the letters needing to be distinct. How many such combinations are possible?" So the letters must be distinct, but the numbers can be anything, possibly with repetition.

Alternatively, perhaps the letters don't need to be distinct, and the problem is simply asking for the total number, which would include all possibilities where letters can repeat. But the options given are E) 97656, which is 26*26*10*10 = 67600, but that's not matching any of the options. Wait, 26 letters, 10 digits. 26^2 * 10^2 is 67600, which is 67600. But looking at the options, option E is 97656, which is higher. So perhaps the letters must be distinct, meaning the first two letters are unique, so 26 *25 *10 *10 = 65000, which is option D.

Wait, let me think this through. If the letters must be distinct, then the first letter has 26 options, the second has 25 options (since it can't repeat the first). The numbers can be any digits, so each of the two digits has 10 options, and they can repeat. So the calculation is 26 *25 *10 *10 = 65000. Looking at the options, option D is 65000.

Alternatively, if the letters don't have to be distinct, then it's 26*26*10*10=67600. But 67600 isn't one of the options. The options given are A)74453, B)64543, C)74325, D)65000, E)97656.

Wait, option E is 97656. Let me compute that: 97656 is 26*26*10*10? No, 26*26 is 676, 10*10 is 100, 676*100=67600. So E is 97656, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the letters are case-sensitive, like uppercase and lowercase are considered different. But the problem didn't mention that, so probably not.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the letters are followed

---------------

 by two numbers, which could be two digits (00 to 99), so 100 possibilities. So the total number would be letters part multiplied by 100.

If letters must be distinct, it's 26*25=650 for the letters part. 650 * 100 = 65000, which is option D.

If letters can repeat, 26*26=676. 676 * 100 = 67600, which isn't an option. So the correct answer must be 65000, option D.

So the question must be that the letters need to be distinct, hence the answer is D)65000.


To determine the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers, we analyze the problem based on whether the letters must be distinct.

1. **If the letters are distinct**:  
   - The first letter has 26 options (A-Z).  
   - The second letter has 25 options (since it cannot repeat the first).  
   - Each of the two numbers has 10 options (0-9), and repetition is allowed.  
   - Total combinations = \( 26 \times 25 \times 10 \times 10 = 65000 \).

2. **If the letters are not distinct**:  
   - The first and second letters each have 26 options, with repetition allowed.  
   - Total combinations = \( 26 \times 26 \times 10 \times 10 = 67600 \).  
   - However, this value is not among the given options.

Given the options provided, the correct answer corresponds to the scenario where the letters are distinct, resulting in \( 65000 \) combinations.
