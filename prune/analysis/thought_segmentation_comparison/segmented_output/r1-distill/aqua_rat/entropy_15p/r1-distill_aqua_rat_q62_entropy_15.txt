Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the maximum distance I can travel with $8.50 in a cab. Let me try

---------------

 to figure this out step by step. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile. Oh

---------------

 right, and then 10 cents for each additional quarter mile. Oh wait, so the initial charge covers the first quarter-mile, and every

---------------

 bit beyond that is 10 cents per quarter-mile. So I need to figure out how much money is left after the first charge and then see how many more quarter-miles I can add

---------------

.

Wait, my total money is $8.50. The first part is $3.50, so subtract

---------------

ing that from 8.50 gives me the remaining money. Let me calculate that: 8.50 minus 3.50 is 5.00. So I have $5 left.



---------------

Each additional quarter-mile is 10 cents. Since it's 10 cents per quarter-mile, I can find out how many of

---------------

 those I can buy with $5. Oh wait, but I should convert that to the same units. So $5 is 

---------------

500 cents, right? Because a dollar is 100 cents, so 5 times 100 is 500. And

---------------

 each quarter-mile is 10 cents, so how many times does 10 cents go into 500 cents? That

---------------

's 500 divided by 10, which is 50. So I can go 50 more quarter-miles.

Wait, no

---------------

, wait. Wait, wait. No, because the first quarter-mile is already included. So the initial 3.50 covers the first quarter-mile

---------------

. Then each additional is 0.10 dollars (10 cents) for a quarter-mile. So the 5 dollars would

---------------

 get me 5 / 0.10 = 50 more quarter-miles. So total distance is the first quarter-mile plus 50 quarter

---------------

-miles.

So, first quarter is 0.25 miles. Then 50 times 0.25 miles.

---------------

 Let's calculate that. 50 * 0.25 is 12.5 miles. So adding the first quarter,

---------------

 0.25 + 12.5 is 12.75 miles. Wait, but wait a

---------------

 second, I think I might be making a mistake here. Because the initial charge is for the first quarter-mile, and then

---------------

 each subsequent is 10 cents. So the total distance is 1 (for the first) + 50 (

---------------

from the remaining money) quarter-miles. So 1 +50 is 51 quarter-miles. Each quarter-mile is 0.25 miles. So 51 * 0.25 is

---------------

 12.75 miles. That seems right.

But wait, let me double-check the math. The total money

---------------

 is $8.50. After paying $3.50, I have $5 left. Each additional 0.25 miles costs $0.10. So the

---------------

 number of additional quarter-miles is 5 / 0.10 = 50. So 50 quarter

---------------

-miles. So total distance is 1 +50 = 51 quarter-miles. 51 * 0.25 is

---------------

 12.75 miles. So that's 12.75 miles total.

Looking at the options, option B is 12.75. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but another

---------------

 thought: sometimes, cab fares might round up to the next quarter-mile. But the problem doesn't mention any such rounding, so I think we

---------------

 can assume that each quarter-mile is charged exactly. So I don't have to worry about partial quarters. So the calculation should

---------------

 be straightforward.

So yeah, the maximum distance is 12.75 miles, which is option B.


To calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 in a cab, start

---------------

 by subtracting the initial charge of $3.50 for the first quarter-mile from the total amount. This leaves $5.00 for additional travel. Each additional quarter-mile costs 10 cents, so divide the remaining $5.00 by $0.10 to determine how many additional quarter-miles can be purchased: 

\[
\frac{5.00}{0.10} = 50 \, \text{quarter-miles}.
\]

The

---------------

 total distance is the sum of the first quarter-mile and the additional 50 quarter-miles:

\[
1 \, \text{quarter-mile} + 50 \, \text{quarter-miles} = 51 \, \text{quarter-miles}.
\]

Convert quarter-miles to miles by multiplying by 0.25:

\[
51 \times 0.25 = 12.75 \, \text{miles}.
\]

Thus, the maximum distance you can travel is **12.75 miles**, which corresponds to option B.
