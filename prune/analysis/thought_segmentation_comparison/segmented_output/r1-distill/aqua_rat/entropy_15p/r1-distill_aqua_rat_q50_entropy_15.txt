Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that I have a money pouch with Rs. 700, and there are equal numbers of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins, and one rupee coins. I need to find out how many of each coin there are. The options are given, but I'll

---------------

 try to solve it without looking at them first.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I know that all the coins are of

---------------

 different denominations but the number of each type is the same. Let's call the number of each type of coin 'n'. So there are 'n' coins of 25 paise, 'n' coins of 50 paise, and 'n' coins of 1 rupee.

Wait, wait,

---------------

 but the total amount is in rupees. I should convert everything to the same unit to make it easier. Since the coins are in paise, maybe

---------------

 I should convert the total amount to paise. Oh right, because 1 rupee is 100 paise. So 700 rupees is 700 * 100 = 70,000 paise. That

---------------

 makes the math easier because I can work in paise without dealing with fractions.

So each type of coin contributes differently. Let's calculate

---------------

 the total paise contributed by each type.

25 paise coins: Each is 25 paise, so n coins would be 25n paise.
50 paise coins: Each is 50 paise, so n coins would

---------------

 be 50n paise.
1 rupee coins: Each is 100 paise, so n coins would be 100n paise.

The

---------------

 sum of all these should equal 70,000 paise. So adding them up:

25n + 50n + 100n = 70,000

Let me add

---------------

 those coefficients. 25 + 50 is 75, plus 100 makes 175. So 

---------------

175n = 70,000.

Now, to find n, I can divide both sides by 175.

n = 70,000 / 175.

Let me compute that. Hmm, 175 times 400 is 70,000 because 175*4 is 700, so 175*400 is 70,000. So n must

---------------

 be 400.

Wait, so each type of coin has 400 coins. Let me check that.



---------------

25 * 400 = 10,000 paise → 100 rupees.
50 * 400 = 20,000 paise → 200 rupees.
100 * 400 = 40,000 paise → 400 rupees.
Adding them

---------------

: 100 + 200 + 400 = 700 rupees. Yep, that adds

---------------

 up correctly.

So the number of each coin is 400. Now looking at the options, option C is 400. So

---------------

 that's the answer.
</think>

The problem involves finding the number of each type of coin in a money pouch containing Rs. 700, with equal numbers of 25 paise, 50 paise, and 1 rupee coins. 



---------------

Let the number of each type of coin be \( n \). Converting the total amount to paise, we have:



---------------

\[
700 \, \text{rupees} = 700 \times 100 = 70,000 \, \text{paise}.
\]

The total contribution from each type of coin is:

\[
25n \, \text{paise (from 25 paise coins)} + 50n \, \text{paise (from 50 paise coins)} + 100n \, \text{paise (from 1 rupee coins)}.
\]

Adding these contributions gives:

\[
25n + 50n + 100n = 175n.
\]

Setting this equal to the total amount in paise:

\[
175n = 70,000.
\]

Solving for \( n \):

\[
n = \frac{70,000}{175} = 400.
\]

Thus, there are 400 coins of each type. Verifying:

\[
25 \times 400 = 10,000 \, \text{paise} = 100 \, \text{rupees}, \\
50 \times 400 = 20,000 \, \text{paise} = 200 \, \text{rupees}, \\
100 \times 400 = 40,000 \, \text{paise} = 400 \, \text{rupees}.
\]

Adding these:



---------------

\[
100 + 200 + 400 = 700 \, \text{rupees}.
\]

The calculations confirm that the number of each type of coin is 400. Among the options, the correct answer is:
