Okay, so I've got this problem here about an astronaut's weight on Earth and Venus, and I need to find out what percentage the Venus weight is compared to Earth. Hmm, let me think about

---------------

 how to approach this.

Wait, the astronaut weighs 211 pounds on Earth and 182 pounds on Venus. The

---------------

 question is asking what percent 182 is of 211. Oh right, so I need to calculate (

---------------

182 / 211) * 100 to get the percentage.

Let me do the division first. 182 divided by 211. Hmm, 

---------------

211 is a bit larger than 180, so I'm expecting the result to be less than 90%

---------------

 because 180/200 is 90%. Wait, but 211 is more than 200, so maybe

---------------

 it's a bit lower than 90%?

Wait, let me actually compute this. Let's see, 211 times

---------------

 0.8 would be 168.8, right? 0.8 times 200 is 160, plus

---------------

 11*0.8 is 8.8, so 168.8. But 182 is higher than that. So

---------------

 80% is 168.8, 90% is 189.9 (since

---------------

 211 * 0.9 is 189.9). Wait, but 182 is less

---------------

 than 189.9, so the percentage is between 80% and 90%.

Wait, maybe

---------------

 I should compute it more accurately. Let me try 182 divided by 211. Let's see, 211 ×

---------------

 0.86 is what? 0.8*211=168.8, 0.06*211=12.66. So 168.8 +12.66=181.46. Oh, that's close

---------------

 to 182. So 0.86 of 211 is about 181.46, which is very

---------------

 close to 182. So the percentage would be approximately 86%.

Wait, but let me check. 

---------------

211 × 0.86 = 211 × (86/100) = (211 × 86) / 100. Let me compute 211 × 86. 

---------------

200 ×86 is 17,200. 11×86 is 946. So total is 17,200 + 946 = 18,146. Divide

---------------

 by 100, that's 181.46. So yeah, 86% gives 

---------------

181.46, which is just 0.54 less than 182. So the actual

---------------

 percentage is just a tiny bit over 86%. But the options have D as 86%, so that must be the correct

---------------

 choice.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate it exactly. Let me try 182 ÷ 211. Let

---------------

's compute this division. 

211 goes into 182 zero times. Add a decimal point, so 1820 divided by 211.

2

---------------

11 × 8 is 1688. So 8 times, subtract 1688 from 1820,

---------------

 we get 132. Bring down a zero: 1320.

211 ×6 is 1266. So

---------------

 6 times, subtract from 1320 gives 54. Bring down another zero: 540.

211 ×2 is 422. So 2 times, subtract 

---------------

422 from 540 gives 118. Bring down another zero: 1180.

211 ×5 is 1055. So 5 times, subtract:

---------------

 125. Hmm, so so far, we have 0.8625... So approximately 86.25%.

---------------

 So that's about 86%, which is option D.


To determine what percent the astronaut’s weight on Venus (182 pounds) is of their weight on Earth (211 pounds), the formula is:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Weight on Venus}}{\text{Weight on Earth}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{182}{211} \right) \times 100
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\frac{182}{211} \approx 0.8625
\]

Multiplying by 100 to convert to a percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage} \approx 86.25\%
\]

This value is very close to 86%, which corresponds to option D. Therefore, the weight of the astronaut on Venus is approximately **86%** of their weight on Earth.
