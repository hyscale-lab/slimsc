Okay, so I've got this problem here about someone named A who's moving in different directions, and I need to figure out how far they are from home after all that traveling. Hmm, let me break

---------------

 it down step by step.

Alright, A starts by traveling 3 km towards the south. So, if I imagine a coordinate system, maybe

---------------

 I can consider A's starting point as the origin (0,0). South would be in the negative y-direction. So after going

---------------

 south 3 km, A is at (0, -3). Got that.

Next, A travels 5 km towards the east. East is the positive x-direction. So adding 5 km to the x-coordinate.

---------------

 Now A is at (5, -3). Wait, wait, no. Wait, no, the first move is south, which is

---------------

 down on the y-axis. So starting at (0,0), moving south 3 would take them to (0,-3). Then east 5 would

---------------

 add 5 to x, so (5, -3). Yep.

Then, A travels 3 km to the north. North is the positive y-direction. So from (5,-3), adding 3 km north would

---------------

 bring them to (5, 0). Because -3 +3 is zero. So now they're at (5, 0).

Finally, A travels 2 km towards the west. West is the negative x-direction. So subtracting 2 from the x-coordinate. 

---------------

5 -2 is 3. So now their position is (3, 0).

Wait, so starting at (0,0), after

---------------

 all these moves, they end up at (3,0). So how far is that from home? Well, the distance from (0,0) to (3,0) is just 3 km.

---------------

 Because the y-coordinate is zero, so it's a straight line along the x-axis.

Looking at the options: option A is 3 km. So the answer should be A.



---------------

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the directions. South, then east, north, then west. Let

---------------

 me visualize this again.

Starting point: (0,0).
After south 3: (0,-3).
East 5: (5,-3).
North 3: (5,0) because moving

---------------

 up from -3 by 3.
West 2: (3,0). Yes, that's correct.

So the

---------------

 final position is 3 km east of home. So the distance is 3 km. So the answer is option A.


A starts at the origin (0,0). Moving 3 km south brings them to (0, -3). Then, moving 5 km east takes them to (5, -3). Next, moving 3 km north brings them to (5, 0). Finally, moving 2 km west places

---------------

 them at (3, 0). The distance from the starting point (0,0) to the final position (3,0) is 3 km.
