Okay, so I have this problem here about a shopkeeper who gave a 20% discount for a day and now needs to raise

---------------

 the price back to the original. The question is asking by what percentage he must increase the discounted price to bring it back to the original. Hmm, I

---------------

 remember this is a percentage increase problem. Let me think through it step by step.

First, let me visualize the situation. Suppose the original price of an item is, let's say, $100. That

---------------

's a common number to make percentages easy. So if the original price is $100, a 20% discount would be

---------------

 20% of 100, which is $20. So the discounted price becomes $80.



---------------

Now, the shopkeeper wants to bring the price back to the original $100 from the discounted $80. The question is, what percentage increase from $80 will

---------------

 get us back to $100?

I remember that percentage increase is calculated by the formula: (Increase / Original) * 100%. Here

---------------

, the original is the discounted price, which is $80. The increase needed is $20 because 100 minus 80 is 20.

So pl

---------------

ugging the numbers in: (20 / 80) * 100% equals what? Let's calculate that. 20 divided by 80 is 0.25. Multiply by 100 gives

---------------

 25%. Oh wait, so the increase needed is 25% of the discounted price.

Wait, but why

---------------

 can't it be 20% again? Because percentage changes are relative. When you take 20% off, you're taking it off the original 

---------------

100, but when you're increasing from a lower value, like 80, a 20% increase would be 

---------------

16, which brings it to 96, not 100. That's why you need a higher percentage to

---------------

 get back to the original price.

Let me check another example to confirm. Suppose the original price is $200. 20% discount is

---------------

 $40, so the price becomes $160. To get back to $200, the increase needed is $40.

---------------

 So, 40 divided by 160 is 0.25, which is 25%. Yep, same result.

So the correct percentage increase

---------------

 needed is 25%. Looking at the options, option C is 25%, so that must be the correct answer.


To determine the percentage increase needed to return the discounted price to the original price, consider the following:

1. Let the original price be \( P \). After a 20% discount, the price becomes \( P \times (1 - 0.20) = 0.80P \).
2. To return

---------------

 to the original price \( P \) from the discounted price \( 0.80P \), the required increase is \( P - 0.80P = 0.20P \).
3. The percentage increase is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase}}{\text{Discounted Price}} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20P}{0.80P} \right) \times 100\% = 25\%.
   \]

Thus, the shopkeeper must increase the discounted price by **25%** to restore it to the original price.
