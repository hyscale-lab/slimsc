Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to understand it. The shopkeeper gave a 20% discount on all items for one day, and now he needs to sell them back to the original price the next day. The question is asking by what percentage he must increase the discounted price to get back to the original price. Hmm, I

---------------

 think I remember something about percentage increases and decreases. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, let's break it down. Suppose the original price of an item is $100. That

---------------

 makes the math easier because percentages are straightforward with 100. So if the original price is $100, a 20% discount would reduce

---------------

 the price by $20. That would make the discounted price $80. 

Now, the next day, the shopkeeper wants to bring the price back to $100 from the discounted $80. So he

---------------

 needs to increase the $80 by a certain percentage to get back to $100. The question is, what's that percentage?

Wait, percentage

---------------

 increase is calculated based on the original amount, right? So in this case, the original for the increase would be the discounted price, which is $80. He

---------------

 needs to go from $80 to $100. 

Let me calculate the increase needed. The difference between $100 and $80 is $20. So he needs to add $20 to $80 to get back to $100. Now

---------------

, what percentage is $20 of $80? 

Percentage increase formula is: (Increase / Original) * 100. So here

---------------

, the increase is $20, and the original is $80. So 20 divided by 80 equals 0.25. Multiply by 100 gives 25%. 

Wait

---------------

, that makes sense. So the increase needed is 25%. So looking at the options, option C is 25%. 



---------------

But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's try with a different original price to see if the percentage still

---------------

 holds. Let's say the original price is $50. 20% discount would be $10, so the discounted price is $40. To get back to $50 from $40, the increase is $10. So

---------------

 10 divided by 40 is 0.25, which is 25%. Yep, same result. 

Another

---------------

 way to think about it: when you decrease by a certain percentage, the increase needed to get back to the original isn't the same percentage. Because the base changes. So

---------------

 when you apply a discount, the new base is lower, so a higher percentage is needed to get back up. 

So

---------------

 the correct answer should be 25%, which is option C.


To determine the percentage increase needed to return to the original price after a 20% discount, let's analyze the problem step by step. Suppose the original price of an item is $100. A 20% discount reduces the price by $20, making the discounted price $80. The next day, the shopkeeper wants to increase the price from $80 back to $100. 

The increase required is $20 ($

---------------

100 - $80). To calculate the percentage increase, use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase}}{\text{Original}}

---------------

 \right) \times 100
\]

Here, the increase is $20, and the original amount

---------------

 is $80. Substituting these values:

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{20}{80} \right) \times 100 = 0.25 \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Thus, the shopkeeper must increase the discounted price by 25% to return to the original price. This result

---------------

 holds regardless of the original price, as the percentage increase is based on the discounted price of $80.

The correct answer is **C) 25%**.
