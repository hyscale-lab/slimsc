Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many children are in a city. Let's see what the question says.

The population of the city is 5,265,526. Out

---------------

 of these, 4,169,516 are adults. I guess the rest must be children. Hmm, so

---------------

 I think the way to solve this is to subtract the number of adults from the total population to get the number of children.

Wait, let

---------------

 me make sure I understand. The total population includes both adults and children. So if I take away the adults, what's left should be the children. That makes sense.

So,

---------------

 the calculation should be: Total population minus adult population equals child population. Let me write that down.

Total = 5,265,526
Adults = 4,169,516
Children = Total - Adults

Let

---------------

 me do the subtraction step by step. Maybe I should write it out like a vertical subtraction to avoid mistakes.

Let's align

---------------

 the numbers:

5,265,526
-4,169,516
------------

---------------



Starting from the rightmost digit:

6 minus 6 is 0.
2 minus 1 is 1.
5 minus 5 is 0.
6 minus 9...

---------------

 oh wait, can't do that. So I need to borrow from the next higher digit.

Wait, let's see:



---------------

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute it step by step.

Another approach: Let me subtract 4,169,516 from 5,265,526.

Breaking

---------------

 it down:

5,265,526 minus 4,000,000 is 1,265,526.
Then, subtract the remaining 169,516.

Wait, no

---------------

, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, 4,169,516 is the

---------------

 same as 4,000,000 + 169,516.

So, subtracting 4,000,000 from 5,265,526 gives 1,265,526.

Now, subtract 169,516 from that.



---------------

1,265,526 - 169,516.

Hmm, let's subtract 

---------------

169,516 from 1,265,526.

Let me write this as 1,265,526 minus 169,516.

Breaking

---------------

 it down:

1,265,526
-  169,516
------------

---------------



Let me subtract digit by digit.

Starting from the units place:

6 - 6 = 0.
2 - 1 = 1.
5 - 5 = 0.
5 - 9.

---------------

 Oh, can't do that, so I need to borrow. So the 5 in the thousands place becomes 4, and the 

---------------

5 in the ten-thousands place becomes 5+1=6.

Wait, maybe I should handle it differently. Let

---------------

 me think in terms of place values.

Wait, 1,265,526 is the same as 1,200,000 + 65,526.

Wait

---------------

, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me just subtract each digit:

1,265,526


---------------

- 169,516

Let's line them up properly:

1,265,526
 

---------------

 169,516
Subtract:

Starting from the right:

6 -6 = 0
2 -1 = 1
5 -5 = 0
5 -9:

---------------

 Can't do that. So borrow 1 from the next higher digit. The 5 in the ten-thousands place becomes

---------------

 4, and the 5 in the thousands place becomes 15. So 15 -9=6.

Now

---------------

, moving to the next digit: The 4 (from the ten-thousands place after borrowing) minus 6 (from

---------------

 the 169,516's ten-thousands place). Wait, 169,516 is

---------------

 169 thousand, so the digits are: 1 (hundred thousands), 6 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 1 (tens), 6 (units).

Wait, maybe

---------------

 I'm getting confused. Let me write it out properly with place alignment.

Let me write the numbers with all digits:

1,265,526 is

---------------

:
1,265,526
= 1,000,000 + 200,000 + 60,000 + 5,000 + 500 + 20 + 6

And

---------------

 169,516 is:
169,516
= 100,000 + 60,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 10 + 6

Wait

---------------

, but when subtracting, perhaps it's easier to subtract each place.

Wait, let's write them as:

1,265,526
-  169,516
=

---------------

 ?

But to align correctly, it's:

  1,265,526
-    169,516
=

---------------

 ?

So:

Starting from the units digit:

6 (units) -6 (units) =0
2 (tens) -1 (tens) =1
5 (hundreds) -5 (hundreds) =0
5 (thousands) -9 (thousands). Can

---------------

't do that, so borrow from the ten-thousands place.

The 6 in the ten-thousands place of 1,265,526 is in

---------------

 the hundred thousands place? Wait, maybe I should break it down:

Wait, 1,265,526 is

---------------

:

1 (million)
2 (hundred thousand)
6 (ten thousand)
5 (thousand)
5 (hundred)
2 (ten)
6 (unit)

Wait

---------------

 no, let me think again. 1,265,526 is:

Millions: 1
Hundred thousands: 2
Ten thousands:6
Thousands:5
Hundreds:5
Tens:2
Units:6

So

---------------

 when subtracting 169,516, which is:

Hundred thousands: 1
Ten thousands:6
Thousands:9
Hundreds:5
Tens:1
Units:6

Wait, no

---------------

. 169,516 is 169 thousand, 516. So:

Hundred thousands: 1 (since

---------------

 169,516 is 1*100,000 + 69,516)


---------------

Wait, no. 169,516 is 100,000 + 60,000 + 9,000 + 500 +10 +6.



---------------

Wait, perhaps aligning the numbers would help:

1,265,526
-  169,516
=

---------------

 ?

Aligning:

1,265,526
   169,516
=

---------------

 ?

So, from the right:

6 -6=0
2-1=1
5-5=0
5 (thousands place) -9 (thousands place):

---------------

 Can't do that, so borrow from the ten thousands place.

The ten thousands place in the top number is 6. So we

---------------

 borrow 1, making it 5, and add 10 to the thousands place. So 5 becomes 15. 15-9=6.

Next, ten thousands place: the

---------------

 top is now 5 (after borrowing), and the bottom is 6. So 5-6. Can't do that, so we need to borrow from the hundred thousands place.

The hundred thousands place in the top number is 2. So

---------------

 we borrow 1, making it 1, and add 10 to the ten thousands place. Now, 5 becomes 15. 15-6=9.

Hundred thousands place: top

---------------

 is now 1, bottom is 1. 1-1=0.

Millions place: 1 - 0=1.

Wait, wait

---------------

, let me double-check each step.

So, after borrowing for the thousands place, the top number's ten thousands digit is

---------------

 5. Then, we subtract 6 (from 169,516's ten thousands digit). Since

---------------

 5 <6, we borrow from the hundred thousands place.

Hundred thousands digit: originally 2. After borrowing, it becomes 1. The

---------------

 ten thousands digit becomes 15.

So 15 -6=9.

Then, the hundred thousands digit is 1 (

---------------

after borrowing), and the bottom number's hundred thousands digit is 1. So 1-1=0.

The million

---------------

 digit remains 1.

Putting it all together, the result is 1,096,010? Wait, wait

---------------

, no.

Wait, let me re-express the subtraction:

We have:

1,265,526
-  169,516
= ?

Let

---------------

 me subtract 169,516 from 1,265,526.

1,265,526 minus

---------------

 169,516.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 1,265,526 - 169,516.



---------------

Let me compute 1,265,526 - 169,516.

Another approach: subtract

---------------

 170,000 from 1,265,526, which is 1,265,526 - 170,000 = 1,095,526. But since I subtracted 584 more than I should have (because 170,000 -169,516=484), I need to add 484 back.

Wait, that

---------------

 might complicate things. Let me think again.

Alternatively, let's compute it step by step:

1,265,526



---------------

Minus 100,000 is 1,165,526.

Minus 60,000 is 1,105,526.

Minus 9,000 is 1,096,526.

Minus 500 is 1,096,026.

Minus 10 is 1,096,016.

Minus 6 is 1,096,010.

Wait, that

---------------

 can't be right because 169,516 is 100k+60k+9k+500+10+6=

---------------

169,516.

So subtracting 169,516 from 1,265,526:



---------------

1,265,526
- 100,000 = 1,165,526
- 60,000 = 1,105,526
- 9,000 = 1,096,526
- 500 = 1,096,026
- 10 = 1,096,016
- 6 = 1,096,010.

Wait, but

---------------

 169,516 is 169,516, so the subtraction should result in 1,265,526 -169,516 = 1,096,010.

Wait, but when

---------------

 I subtracted 100k, 60k, etc., I ended up with 1,096,010.

So

---------------

, going back to the initial problem, the number of children would be 1,096,010.

Wait, but looking

---------------

 at the options:

Options are:

A)1,095,961
B)1,065,961
C)1,085,961
D)1,097,961
E)1,096,061

Hmm, none

---------------

 of these options match 1,096,010. Did I make a mistake in my calculation?

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I should approach the problem differently. Maybe I should subtract the numbers directly.

Let me try another method: 5,265,526 minus 4,169,516.

Let

---------------

 me write both numbers:

5,265,526
-4,169,516
= ?

Let

---------------

 me subtract each place:

Starting from the right:

6-6=0
2-1=1
5-5=0
5-9: Can't do, so borrow from

---------------

 the next higher digit.

The thousands place in 5,265,526 is 5. The next higher digit is the ten thousands place, which is 6. So,

---------------

 borrow 1 from the 6, making it 5, and add 10 to the 5, making it 15. So, 15-9=6.

Next digit: the

---------------

 ten thousands place is now 5 (after borrowing). Subtract 6 from it. 5-6 can't do, so borrow from the hundred thousands place.

Hundred thousands place is 6.

---------------

 After borrowing, it becomes 5, and the ten thousands place becomes 15. 15-6=9.

Next digit: hundred thousands place is 5 (

---------------

after borrowing). Subtract 1 from it. 5-1=4.

Million place: 5-4=1.

Wait, let

---------------

 me do it step by step.

5,265,526
-4,169,516
= ?

Starting

---------------

 from units:

6-6=0
2-1=1
5-5=0
5-9: Can

---------------

't do. So borrow from the ten thousands place.

Ten thousands place is 6, so it becomes 5. Add

---------------

 10 to the thousands place: 5 becomes 15. 15-9=6.

Ten thousands place now

---------------

 is 5 (after borrowing). Next digit is 6 (from 4,169,516's

---------------

 ten thousands place). 5-6: Can't do. Borrow from hundred thousands place.

Hundred thousands place is 2.

---------------

 Wait, no: the original number is 5,265,526.

Wait, wait, perhaps I need

---------------

 to write the numbers with place markers.

Let me write:

5,265,526 as:

5 (millions)
2 (hundred thousands)
6 (ten thousands)
5 (thousands)
5 (hundreds)
2 (tens)
6 (units)

4

---------------

,169,516 as:

4 (millions)
1 (hundred thousands)
6 (ten thousands)
9 (thousands)
5 (hundreds)
1 (tens)
6 (units)

So subtraction

---------------

:

5,265,526
-4,169,516
= ?

Let

---------------

's subtract each digit:

Millions place: 5-4=1.

Hundred thousands: 2-1=1.

Ten thousands: 6-6=0.

Thousands: 5-9. Can't do. So borrow from ten thousands place. But

---------------

 ten thousands is 0 after subtraction. So I need to go to the hundred thousands place.

Wait, wait, perhaps I

---------------

 should do this digit by digit.

Wait, let's subtract digit by digit, starting from the units.

Units: 6-6=0.

Tens: 2-1=1.

Hundreds:5-5=0.

Thousands:5-9. Can't do. So borrow

---------------

 from ten thousands.

Ten thousands digit is 6. So borrow 1, making it 5, and thousands digit becomes 15. 15-9=6.

Ten thousands digit now

---------------

 is 5. Next, ten thousands place in the minuend is 5, and the subtrahend is 6.

So 5-6.

---------------

 Can't do. So we need to borrow from hundred thousands place.

Hundred thousands digit is 2. Borrow 1, making it 1. Add

---------------

 10 to the ten thousands place: 5 becomes 15. Now, 15-6=9.

Hundred thousands digit is now 1. Next

---------------

, hundred thousands place: 1-1=0.

Millions place:5-4=1.

Putting it all together, the result is 1,096,010.

Wait, but

---------------

 none of the options match that. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A)1,095,961

B)1,065,961

C)1,085,961

D)1,097,961

E)1,096,061

Hmm, none

---------------

 of these is 1,096,010. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I made

---------------

 a mistake in subtraction. Let me try another approach, perhaps using addition to find the difference.

What's the total? 5,265,526.

Adult

---------------

s:4,169,516.

So, children = 5,265,526 -4,169,516.

Let

---------------

 me compute 5,265,526 minus 4,169,516.

Another

---------------

 approach: 5,265,526 = 5,000,000 + 265,526.

4,169,516 =4,000,000 +169,516.

So, 5,000,000 -4,000,000=1,000,000.

Then, 265,526 -169,516 = ?



---------------

Compute 265,526 minus 169,516.

265,526


---------------

-169,516
= ?

Let me subtract:

265,526 -169,516.

Units

---------------

:6-6=0.

Tens:2-1=1.

Hundreds:5-5=0.

Thousands:5-9. Can't do, so borrow.

The

---------------

 ten thousands place is 6, so borrow 1, making it 5, and add 10 to the thousands place:5 becomes 15. 15-9=6.

Ten thousands place is now 5. Subtract

---------------

 6 (from 169,516's ten thousands place): 5-6. Can't do, borrow from hundred thousands.

Hundred thousands place is 2,

---------------

 becomes 1. Ten thousands becomes 15. 15-6=9.

Hundred thousands:1-1=0.

So,

---------------

 265,526 -169,516=96,010.

So

---------------

 total children:1,000,000 +96,010=1,096,010.

But

---------------

 again, this doesn't match any of the options. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial subtraction.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I should compute 5,265,526 minus 4,169,516.



---------------

Let me line them up and subtract:

5,265,526
-4,169,516
=

---------------

 ?

Starting from the right:

6-6=0
2-1=1
5-5=0
5-9: can

---------------

't do. So borrow.

The ten thousands place is 6. So borrow 1, making it 5, and add

---------------

 10 to the thousands place (5 becomes 15). 15-9=6.

Now, ten thousands place is 5. Next

---------------

 digit: 5 (from 6 after borrowing) minus 6 (from 169,516's ten thousands). 5-6 can't do. So borrow from hundred thousands.

Hundred thousands digit is 2, which

---------------

 becomes 1. Ten thousands becomes 15. 15-6=9.

Hundred thousands digit is 1.

---------------

 Next digit: 1-1=0.

Millions digit:5-4=1.

So the result is 1,096,010.

But

---------------

 none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I should use another method.

---------------

 Let me add the number of children to the adult population and see if I get the total.

Suppose the number of children is option

---------------

 A:1,095,961.

Adding to adults:4,169,516 +1,095,961.

Let me compute that.

4,169,516 +1,095,961.

Adding

---------------

:

4,169,516
+1,095,961
= ?

Adding

---------------

 units:

6+1=7.

1+6=7.

5+9=14. Write down 4, carry 1.

9+5=14, plus 1=

---------------

15. Write down 5, carry 1.

6+9=15, plus 1=16. Write 6, carry 1.

1+0=1, plus 1=2.

4+1=5.

So total

---------------

 is 5,265,477.

But the total population is 5,265,526. So 

---------------

5,265,477 is 49 less. So option A is not correct.

Hmm, that

---------------

's not matching. Let me check another option.

Option E:1,096,061.

Adding to adults:4,169,516 +1,096,061.

Compute

---------------

:

4,169,516
+1,096,061
= ?

6

---------------

+1=7.

1+6=7.

5+0=5.

9+6=15, write 5, carry 1.

6+9=15, plus 1=16, write 6, carry 1.

1+0=1, plus 1=2.

4+1=5.

So total

---------------

 is 5,265,577. Which is 51 more than the total population of 5,265,526. So option

---------------

 E is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I should check option D:1,097,961.

Adding to adults:4,169,516 +1,097,961.

Compute

---------------

:

4,169,516 +1,097,961.

Adding units:

6+1=7.

1+6=7.

5+9=14, write 4, carry 1.

9+7=16, plus 1=17, write 7, carry 1.

6+9=15, plus 1=16, write 6, carry 1.

1+0=1, plus 1=2.

4+1=5.

So the sum is 5,267,477. Which is higher

---------------

 than 5,265,526. So option D is wrong.

What about option C:1,085,961.

Adding to adults:4,169,516 +1,085,961.

Compute

---------------

:

4,169,516
+1,085,961
= ?

6+1=7.

1+6=7.

5+9=14, write 4, carry 1.

9+8=17, plus 1=18, write 8, carry 1.

6+5=11, plus 1=12, write 2, carry 1.

1+0=1, plus 1=2.

4+1=5.

Sum

---------------

 is 5,255,477. Which is less than 5,265,526. So option

---------------

 C is not correct.

Option B:1,065,961.

Adding to adults:4,169,516 +1,065,961.

Compute

---------------

:

4,169,516
+1,065,961
= ?

6+1=7.

1+6=7.

5+9=14, write 4, carry 1.

9+6=15, plus 1=16, write 6, carry 1.

6+5=11, plus 1=12, write 2, carry 1.

1+0=1, plus 1=2.

4+1=5.

Sum is 5,235,477. Still

---------------

 less than the total.

So none of the options when added to the adult population gives the correct total. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in my

---------------

 initial subtraction?

Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator approach, but since I can't, maybe I should recount the subtraction

---------------

.

Wait, let's do it another way. Let me compute 5,265,526 minus 4,169,516.

5

---------------

,265,526 -4,169,516 = ?

Let me subtract 4 million from

---------------

 5 million: 1,265,526.

Then subtract 169,516 from 1,265,526.

Wait

---------------

, 1,265,526 minus 169,516.

Let me compute this

---------------

:

1,265,526
-169,516
= ?

1,265,526 minus

---------------

 100,000 is 1,165,526.

Minus 60,000: 1,105,526.

Minus 9,000: 1,096,526.

Minus 500: 1,096,026.

Minus 10: 1,096,016.

Minus 6: 1,096,010.

Wait, same

---------------

 result as before. So the correct number of children is 1,096,010. But none of the options match this

---------------

. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial problem understanding.

Wait, the question is: population is 5,265,526, and

---------------

 adults are 4,169,516. So children = total - adults.

Wait, perhaps the numbers

---------------

 are written with commas as thousand separators, so maybe 5,265,526 is 5 million 265 thousand 526.

---------------

 Or maybe not. Wait, but in the question, it's written as 5265526, which

---------------

 is 5,265,526. Similarly, 4,169,516 is 

---------------

4,169,516.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the subtraction. Let me try to

---------------

 compute 5,265,526 -4,169,516.

Let me write

---------------

 both numbers:

5,265,526
-4,169,516
= ?

Let

---------------

 me subtract each digit:

Start from the right:

6-6=0.

2-1=1.

5-5=0.

5-9: can't do. So borrow 

---------------

1 from the ten thousands place. The ten thousands digit is 6, so it becomes 5. Add 10 to the thousands digit:5 becomes 15. 15-9=6.

Now, ten thousands place: 

---------------

5 (after borrowing) minus 6 (from the subtrahend's ten thousands place). Can't do, so borrow from the hundred thousands place. The hundred thousands digit is 2, so it becomes 1. The ten thousands digit becomes 15. 15-6=9.

Hundred thousands place:1 (after borrowing) minus 1 (from the subtrahend's hundred thousands place).

---------------

 1-1=0.

Millions place:5-4=1.

So the result is 1,096,010.

Hmm

---------------

. So according to this, the correct number of children is 1,096,010. But none

---------------

 of the options match this. Wait, perhaps the options have a typo, or perhaps I made a mistake in reading the numbers.

Wait, let

---------------

 me check the problem again.

The population is 5265526. So 5,265,526.

Adults are 4169516. So 4,169,516.

So

---------------

 5,265,526 -4,169,516 =1,096,010.

Looking

---------------

 at the options:

E)1,096,061.

Wait, that's very close. The difference

---------------

 is 51.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the subtraction.

Wait, let me recompute the subtraction.



---------------

5,265,526 minus 4,169,516.

Another way: 

---------------

5,265,526 = 4,169,516 + X.

X =5,265,526 -4,169,516.

Let

---------------

 me compute this as (5,265,526 -4,000,000) =1,265,526.

Then subtract 169,516 from that: 1,265,526 -169,516.

Compute

---------------

 1,265,526 -169,516.

1,265,526 minus

---------------

 100,000 is 1,165,526.

Minus 60,000 is 1,105,526.

Minus 9,000 is 1,096,526.

Minus 500 is 1,096,026.

Minus 10 is 1,096,016.

Minus 6 is 1,096,010.

Same

---------------

 result.

Hmm. So the correct answer is 1,096,010, which isn't one of the options. But

---------------

 wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the numbers.

Wait, perhaps the numbers in the question are written

---------------

 differently. Let me check.

Question says: population is 5265526, adults 4169516.

Wait

---------------

, perhaps I misread the numbers. Let me count the digits.

5265526: let's count the

---------------

 digits. 5,2,6,5,5,2,6. That's 7 digits. So 5,265,526.

4169516: 4,1,6,9,5,1,6. 7 digits:

---------------

 4,169,516.

So my previous calculations are correct.

But the options don't include 1,096,010. So

---------------

 perhaps I made a mistake in the subtraction.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 5,265,526 minus 4,169,516 using

---------------

 another method.

Let me compute it digit by digit, borrowing as needed.

5,265,526
-4,169,516
= ?

Starting

---------------

 from the units:

6 -6 =0.

Tens:2-1=1.

Hundreds:5-5=0.

Thousands:5-9. Can't do. So borrow from ten thousands.

Ten thousands digit is 6.

---------------

 So borrow 1, making it 5. Thousands digit becomes 15. 15-9=6.

Ten thousands:5-6. Can't do. Borrow from hundred thousands.

Hundred thousands digit is 2, becomes 1. Ten thousands becomes 15. 15-6=9.

Hundred thousands:1-1=0.

Millions:5-4=1.

So,

---------------

 result is 1,096,010.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but looking

---------------

 at the options, option E is 1,096,061. That's 51 more than our

---------------

 calculated value. Could I have made a mistake in the subtraction somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I should add 4,169,516 and option E:

---------------

1,096,061.

4,169,516 +1,096,061 =5

---------------

,265,577.

But the total population is 5,265,526. So 

---------------

5,265,577 is 51 more. So option E is too high.

Hmm. So

---------------

 perhaps none of the options are correct, but that's unlikely. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial subtraction.

Wait, another

---------------

 approach: let me compute the difference between 5,265,526 and 4,169,516.

I

---------------

 can break it down:

5,265,526 =5,000,000 +265,526.

4,169,516 =4,000,000 +169,516.

Subtracting:

---------------

 5,000,000-4,000,000=1,000,000.

265,526 -169,516=96,010.

Total:1,096,010.

So

---------------

 the correct answer is 1,096,010.

Looking back at the options, the closest is option E:1,096,061, which is 51 more. So

---------------

 perhaps I made a mistake in the thousands place subtraction.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the thousands place. Let me re

---------------

-examine.

In the thousands place: the minuend is 5, and the subtrahend is 9.

So

---------------

 I borrow 1 from the ten thousands place, making it 5-1=4 (wait, no, the ten thousands digit was 6, which

---------------

 becomes 5 after borrowing 1 for the thousands place).

Wait, perhaps I should write down each digit:

5,265,526



---------------

-4,169,516

Let's subtract each digit:

Millions:5-4=1.

Hundred thousands:2-1=1.

Ten thousands:6-6=0.

Thousands:5-9. Can't do, so borrow from ten thousands.

---------------

 Ten thousands is 0, so need to go to hundred thousands.

Wait, wait, the ten thousands digit is 6,

---------------

 but after subtracting 6 (from 4,169,516's ten thousands), it's 0.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.

Let me write the numbers as:

5,265,526


---------------

-4,169,516
= ?

Let me write each digit:

Millions:5-4=1.

Hundred thousands:2-1=1.

Ten thousands:6-6=0.

Thousands:5-9. Can't do. So borrow 1 from the ten thousands place (which is 0),

---------------

 so need to go higher.

Ah, wait, ten thousands place is 0, so I need to borrow from the hundred thousands place.

Hundred thousands digit is 1 (after subtracting 1 in

---------------

 the hundred thousands place). So borrow 1, making it 0, and add 10 to the ten thousands place (

---------------

which was 0, now becomes 10). Then, thousands digit:5 +10 (from borrow?) Wait, maybe

---------------

 I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the thousands digit is 5, but after borrowing, it becomes 15.

---------------

 Wait, but the ten thousands place is 0, so to borrow, I need to go to the hundred thousands.

So

---------------

, hundred thousands digit is 1, borrow 1, making it 0. Ten thousands digit becomes 10 (from 0).

---------------

 Now, thousands digit is 5, and we need to subtract 9.

Wait, but the thousands digit is 5. So

---------------

 5 can't subtract 9, so we borrow 1 from the ten thousands place (which is now 10,

---------------

 so it becomes 9, and thousands becomes 15). Now, 15-9=6.

So,

---------------

 the thousands digit is 6.

Ten thousands digit: after borrowing, it's 9.

Hundred thousands digit:0.

Millions:1.

So the

---------------

 result is 1,096,010.

So, yes, the correct answer is 1,096,010. But the

---------------

 options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps I misread the population or

---------------

 the adult numbers.

Wait, the population is 5,265,526.

Adults:4,169,516.

Yes

---------------

, that's correct.

Hmm. Wait, looking at the options, option E is 1,096,061. That

---------------

's very close. Perhaps I made a mistake in the subtraction.

Wait, let me check another way. Let me add 4,169,516 and 1,096,010 to

---------------

 see if it equals 5,265,526.

4,169,516 +1,096,010.

Let

---------------

's add:

4,169,516
+1,096,010
= ?

6

---------------

+0=6.

1+1=2.

5+0=5.

9+6=15, write 5, carry 1.

6+9=15, plus 1=16, write 6, carry 1.

1+0=1, plus 1=2.

4+1=5.

So sum

---------------

 is 5,265,526. Correct.

So the correct number of children is 1,096,010. But none

---------------

 of the options match. So perhaps the options have a typo, or I made a mistake.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A)1,095,961

B)1,065,961

C)1,085,961

D)1,097,961

E)1,096,061

Option

---------------

 E is 1,096,061. Our calculated value is 1,096,010. So

---------------

 the difference is 51. Perhaps I made a mistake in the subtraction.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 5,265,526 minus 4,169,516 again

---------------

, but this time more carefully.

Let me write both numbers vertically:

     5,265,526
   - 4,169,516
   =------------

---------------



Starting from the right:

6-6=0.

2-1=1.

5-5=0.

5-9: Can't do. So borrow 1 from the ten thousands place. Ten thousands is 6, becomes 5. Thousands becomes 15. 15-9=6.

Next

---------------

 digit (ten thousands):5-6. Can't do. Borrow 1 from hundred thousands. Hundred thousands is 2, becomes 1. Ten thousands becomes 15. 15-6=9.

Hundred thousands:1-1=0.

Millions:5-4=1.

So result is 1,096,010.

I

---------------

 must have done this correctly. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but since that's unlikely, perhaps I made

---------------

 a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem was written with a comma as a thousand separator, and I misread the numbers. Let me check

---------------

 the numbers again.

The population is 5265526. That's 5,265,526.

Adults:4169516 →

---------------

4,169,516.

So subtraction is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again. Option

---------------

 E is 1,096,061, which is 51 more than our result.

Wait, 

---------------

1,096,010 +51=1,096,061.

Hmm. Could

---------------

 I have made a mistake in the thousands place subtraction? Let me check that step again.

Wait, in the thousands place: 

---------------

5-9. So I borrow 1 from ten thousands, making it 15-9=6.

But what

---------------

 if, instead, I have 5 in thousands and 9 in subtrahend's thousands. So 5 becomes

---------------

 15 after borrowing, 15-9=6.

Yes, correct.

In ten thousands place:6 becomes

---------------

 5 after borrowing. 5-6. Can't do, so borrow from hundred thousands. Hundred thousands is 2, becomes 1. Ten thousands becomes 15. 15-6=9.

Yes

---------------

.

Hundred thousands:1-1=0.

So, the result is 1,096,010.

Hmm

---------------

. Since none of the options match, perhaps I should re-examine the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the question states that the number

---------------

 of adults is 4,169,516, but perhaps it's 4,169,516 children

---------------

, and the question is asking for adults. No, the question states that 4,169,516 are adults, so children

---------------

 are the rest.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial subtraction. Let me try using another method: adding up

---------------

.

If the number of children is 1,096,010, adding to adults should give the total.

4

---------------

,169,516 +1,096,010 =5,265,526. Correct.

So,

---------------

 the correct answer is 1,096,010.

But looking at the options, the closest is option E:1,096,061.

Wait

---------------

, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Maybe I should recheck my subtraction.

Wait, perhaps I should

---------------

 compute 5,265,526 -4,169,516 using a calculator-like

---------------

 approach.

Let me compute 5,265,526 minus 4,169,516.

5

---------------

,265,526
-4,169,516
= ?

I can compute

---------------

 this as:

5,265,526 -4,169,516 = (5,265,526 -4,000,000) -169,516 =1,265,526 -169,516.

Compute

---------------

 1,265,526 -169,516.

Let me subtract 169,516 from 1,265,526.

1

---------------

,265,526 -100,000 =1,165,526.

1,165,526 -60,000=1,105,526.

1,105,526 -9,000=1,096,526.

1,096,526 -500=1,096,026.

1,096,026 -10=1,096,016.

1,096,016 -6=1,096,010.

Same

---------------

 result.

Hmm. So I think the correct answer is 1,096,010, but it's not among

---------------

 the options. But perhaps I made a mistake in reading the numbers.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the population

---------------

 is 5265526. Did I read it correctly? Yes, 5,265,526.

Adults:4169516 →4,169,516.

So

---------------

, perhaps the intended answer is option E:1,096,061, but I don't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the subtraction

---------------

. Let me compute 5,265,526 minus 4,169,516 again

---------------

.

Another approach: 5,265,526 -4,169,516.

I

---------------

 can write this as (5,265,526 -4,169,516) = ?

Let

---------------

 me compute 5,265,526 minus 4,169,516.

5

---------------

,265,526
-4,169,516
= ?

Starting from the right:

6-6=0.

2-1=1.

5-5=0.

5-9: Can

---------------

't do. So borrow 1 from the ten thousands place. Ten thousands is 6 →5. Thousands becomes 15 →15-9=6.

Ten thousands:5-6. Can't do. Borrow 1 from hundred thousands. Hundred thousands is 2→1. Ten thousands becomes 15 →15-6=9.

Hundred thousands:1-1=0.

Millions:5-4=1.

So the

---------------

 result is 1,096,010.

I'm confident this is correct. But the options don't have this. So

---------------

 perhaps the intended answer is E:1,096,061, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, perhaps I made

---------------

 a mistake in the thousands place subtraction. Let me recheck.

Wait, when I subtract 9 from 5 in thousands place, I borrow

---------------

 1, making it 15-9=6. Correct.

In the ten thousands place, 5 (after borrowing) -

---------------

6: can't do, so borrow from hundred thousands, making it 15-6=9.

So yes, that

---------------

's correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Since none of the options match, but the closest is E, perhaps that's the intended answer.

---------------

 But according to my calculations, it's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial problem.

Wait, perhaps the population

---------------

 is 5,265,526 and adults are 4,169,516. So

---------------

 children are 1,096,010.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that

---------------

's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express the numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 5,265,526 minus 4,169,516.



---------------

Let me compute this step by step:

5,265,526
-4,169,516
= (5,000,000 -4,000,000) + (265,526 -169,516)
=1,000,000 +96,010
=1,096,010.

Yes

---------------

, same result.

So, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed. But among the options, option E is 1,096,061, which is 

---------------

51 more than the correct value. So I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial problem

---------------

 setup. Let me re-read the question.

The question says: population is 5265526, adults

---------------

 4169516. How many children?

Yes, correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps

---------------

 I should choose the closest one. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the subtraction.

Wait, another approach: perhaps

---------------

 I should compute 5,265,526 minus 4,169,516 using

---------------

 another method, such as adding up.

Compute 4,169,516 + X =5,265,526.

So X=5,265,526 -4,169,516.

Let

---------------

 me compute 4,169,516 +1,000,000=5,169,516.

5

---------------

,265,526 -5,169,516=96,010.

So X=1,000,000 +96,010=1,096,010.

Yes

---------------

, same result.

So, I think the correct answer is 1,096,010, which isn't among

---------------

 the options. But since that's not possible, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking at the options again, option E is 1,096,061. Let

---------------

 me compute 4,169,516 +1,096,061.

4,169,516 +1,096,061.

Adding

---------------

:

6+1=7.

1+6=7.

5+0=5.

9+6=15,

---------------

 write 5, carry 1.

6+9=15, plus 1=16, write 6, carry 1.

1+0=1, plus 1=2.

4+1=5.

So sum is 5,265,577, which is 51 more than the population.

So option

---------------

 E is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A:1,095,961.

Compute

---------------

 4,169,516 +1,095,961.

4,169,516 +1,095,961.

6+1=7.

1+6=7.

5+9=14, write 4, carry 1.

9+5=14, plus 1=15, write 5, carry 1.

6+9=15, plus 1=16, write 6, carry 1.

1+0=1, plus 1=2.

4+1=5.

Sum is5,265,477. Which is 49 less than the population.

Hmm. Not correct.

So

---------------

, I think the correct answer is 1,096,010, which isn't listed. But perhaps

---------------

 I made a mistake in the subtraction.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the difference between the two numbers.

5

---------------

,265,526
-4,169,516
= ?

Let me subtract

---------------

 each digit:

Millions:5-4=1.

Hundred thousands:2-1=1.

Ten thousands:6-6=0.

Thousands:5-9. Can't do. Borrow 1 from ten thousands (

---------------

which is 0), so go to hundred thousands. Hundred thousands is 1, borrow 1, making it 0. Ten thousands becomes 10. Then, thousands digit

---------------

:5+10=15. 15-9=6.

Ten thousands: after borrowing, it's 9 (since

---------------

 10-1=9).

Hundred thousands:0.

So, result is 1,096,010.

Yes

---------------

, same result.

I think I've spent enough time on this. The correct answer is 1,096,010, but since it's not among the options, perhaps the intended answer is E:1,096,061, but I'm not sure why.


To determine the number of children in the city, we subtract the number of adults from the total population:

**Total population**: 5,265,526  
**Adults**: 4,169,516  
**Children**: Total population - Adults = 5,265,526 - 4,169,516.

### Step-by-Step Subtraction:
1. **Units place**: 6 - 6 = 0  
2. **Tens place**: 2 - 1 = 1  
3. **Hundreds place**: 5 - 5 = 0  
4. **Thousands place**: 5 - 9. Since 5 < 9, borrow 1 from the ten thousands place. The ten thousands digit (6) becomes 5, and the thousands digit becomes 15. Then, 15 - 9 = 6.  
5. **Ten thousands place**: After borrowing, the ten thousands digit is 5. Subtract 6 (from the subtrahend's ten thousands place). Since 5 < 6, borrow 1 from the hundred thousands place. The hundred thousands digit (2) becomes 1, and the ten thousands digit becomes 15. Then, 15 - 6 = 9.  
6. **Hundred thousands place**: After borrowing, the hundred thousands digit is 1. Subtract 1 (from the subtrahend's hundred thousands place). 1 - 1 = 0.  
7. **Millions place**: 5 - 4 = 1.

Thus, the result of the subtraction is **1,096,010**.

### Verification:
To confirm, add the number of adults and children:  
4,169,516 + 1,096,010 = 5,265,526, which matches the total population.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A) 1,095,961**: Adding this to the number of adults gives 4,169,516 + 1,095,961 = 5,265,477, which is 49 less than the total population.  
- **B) 1,065,961**: Adding this to the number of adults gives 4,169,516 + 1,065,961 = 5,235,477, which is significantly less than the total population.  
- **C) 1,085,961**: Adding this to the number of adults gives 4,169,516 + 1,085,961 = 5,255,477, which is less than the total population.  
- **D) 1,097,961**: Adding this to the number of adults gives 4,169,516 + 1,097,961 = 5,267,477, which is 1,951 more than the total population.  
- **E) 1,096,061**: Adding this to the number of adults gives 4,169,516 + 1,096,061 = 5,265,577, which is 51 more than the total population.

### Conclusion:
The correct number of children is **1,096,010**, but this value is not listed among the options. The closest option is **E) 1,096,061**, which is 51 more than the calculated value. Despite this

---------------

 discrepancy, **E** is the most reasonable choice based on the given options.
