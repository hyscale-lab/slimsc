Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about a positive integer Q that has exactly 5 factors. I

---------------

 need to figure out which of the given statements must be true about Q. The options are I, II, and III, and I have to choose which

---------------

 combination is correct. The options given are A, B, C, D, E, each corresponding to different combinations.

Hmm, I

---------------

 remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Let me think. The formula for finding the number of factors is that

---------------

 if a number N can be expressed as the product of primes raised to exponents, like N = p1^a * p2^b * p3^c...,

---------------

 then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc. 

So for

---------------

 Q, which has 5 factors, I need to find what its prime factorization must look like. Since 5 is a prime number, the only

---------------

 way to express 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 itself. So the formula (a+1)(b+1)... must equal 5. That

---------------

 means the exponents plus one multiply to 5. 

Looking at 5, the possible exponents would be when one

---------------

 of the exponents is 4 and the others are zero (since 4+1=5, and if there are other

---------------

 primes, their exponents would have to be zero, which would make them not present). Or wait, could it be a

---------------

 product of exponents in another way? Like, 5 is a prime, so no, because 5 can't be broken down further into

---------------

 smaller integers greater than 1. So that means the number Q must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime number. Because if

---------------

 it were, say, p^2 * q^1, then the number of factors would be (2+1)(1+1) = 3*2=6, which is more than 5. So that's

---------------

 not possible.

So Q must be the fourth power of a prime. Wait, but I think I might be getting confused. Let

---------------

 me think again. If Q is p^4, then the number of factors is 4+1=5, which

---------------

 fits. But is there any other possibility? Suppose Q is a product of two primes, like p^1 * q^1. Then the number of factors is (1+1)(1+1)=4, which is less than 5. So that's

---------------

 not it. Alternatively, if Q is p^2, then factors are 3, which is also not 5. Hmm

---------------

.

Wait, so the only way to get 5 factors is when Q is p^4. Because 5 is a prime number, and

---------------

 the exponents plus one multiply to 5. So that would mean only one prime with exponent 4. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Wait

---------------

, square would be p^2, which has 3 factors. So statement I is incorrect because Q is p^4, not p^2. So

---------------

 statement I is false.

Statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. That's exactly what we concluded. So statement II is true.

Statement III says Q is the product of two primes. Well

---------------

, if Q were p*q, then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1)=4, which is not 5. So statement III is false.

So the

---------------

 only correct statement is II. Looking at the options, option C is II only. But wait, let me double-check the

---------------

 options. The options are:

A) I only
B) III only
C) II only
D) I and II only
E) I and III only

Wait, but

---------------

 wait. Did I make a mistake earlier? Because another thought comes to mind. What about if Q is p^4, then

---------------

 it's the fourth power, which is also a square. Because (p^2)^2 = p^4. So,

---------------

 the square of p squared is p^4. So, is p^4 considered the square of a prime? Wait, no. Because the

---------------

 square of a prime would be p^2. So Q is p^4, which is the square of p squared, but p

---------------

 squared isn't necessarily a prime. Wait, p is a prime, so p squared is not a prime. So Q is

---------------

 the square of p squared, but that's not the same as the square of a prime. So statement I, which says Q is the square of a prime, would be incorrect because

---------------

 Q is p^4, which is (p^2)^2. But p^2 is not a prime unless p is 2,

---------------

 but even then, p^2 is 4, which is not prime. So statement I is false.

So only statement II is correct. So

---------------

 the correct option is C) II only.

Wait, but wait again. Let me think about the number of factors. If

---------------

 Q is p^4, then the factors are 1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4. So

---------------

 that's five factors. Yes, correct. So the only possible form is p^4, making statement II true.

So

---------------

 the answer should be option C.


To determine which statements about \( Q \) must be true, we analyze the number of factors \( Q \) has. The number of factors of a positive integer \( Q \), expressed in its prime factorization as \( Q = p_1^{a} p_2^{b} p_3^{c} \dots \), is given by \( (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)\dots \). Since \( Q \) has exactly 5 factors, and 5 is a prime number, the only way to express 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is \( 5 = 5 \times 1 \). This implies that \( Q \) must be of the form \( p^4 \), where \( p \) is a prime number. 

### Analysis of the Statements:
1. **Statement I: \( Q \) is the square of a prime number.**  
   If \( Q \) were the square of a prime number, it would be \( p^2 \). The number of factors of \( p^2 \) is \( 2 + 1 = 3 \), which is not equal to 5. Therefore, this statement is **false**.

2. **Statement II: \( Q \) is the fourth power of a prime number.**  
   If \( Q = p^4 \), the number of factors is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \), which matches the given condition. Therefore, this statement is **true**.

3. **Statement III: \( Q \) is the product of two prime numbers.**  
   If \( Q \) were the product of two prime numbers, it would be \( p \times q \), where \( p \) and \( q \) are distinct primes. The number of factors of \( p \times q \) is \( (1+1)(1+1) = 4 \), which is not equal to 5. Therefore, this statement is **false**.

### Conclusion:
Only Statement II is true. Thus, the correct answer is:
