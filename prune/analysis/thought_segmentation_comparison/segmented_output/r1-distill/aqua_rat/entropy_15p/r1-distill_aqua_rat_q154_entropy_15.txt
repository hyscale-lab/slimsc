Okay, so I have this problem about a room's height and semi-perimeter. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm

---------------

, the question says the height to semi-perimeter ratio is 2:5. So, I'll note that down as

---------------

 H:S = 2:5, where H is height and S is semi-perimeter.

Wait, what's the semi-perimeter of a room? Oh right, a

---------------

 room is usually a rectangular box, so it has a length and width. The semi-perimeter would be half the perimeter of the floor, which

---------------

 is (L + W)/2. So, S = (L + W)/2.

The ratio H:S is 2:5, so H

---------------

/S = 2/5. So H = (2/5) * S. Or, S = (5/2) * H. I

---------------

'll keep that in mind.

Next part of the problem is about the cost to paper the walls. It costs Rs.260,

---------------

 using paper that's 50cm wide, at Rs.2 per meter. They also allowed 15 sq.m for doors and windows.

Wait

---------------

, papering the walls means covering the lateral surface area, right? So the area of the walls is the perimeter times the height. But we

---------------

 have to subtract the area for doors and windows.

Wait, the total cost is Rs.260. The paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters. The cost per meter is Rs.2. Hmm, so

---------------

 I think the cost relates to the area of paper used. Because when you buy paper, you pay per meter length, but the area is

---------------

 width times length.

So, the paper's area used would be the length of the paper (which is the perimeter of the room,

---------------

 perhaps?) multiplied by the width of the paper. But wait, actually, you're covering the walls. So the total area of

---------------

 the walls is perimeter * height, minus the doors and windows area.

But the problem gives the cost, so let's think

---------------

 about how that relates to the area.

So, the paper cost is Rs.260. The paper is sold at Rs.2 per meter. Wait

---------------

, but paper is sold by the length, and each meter is 0.5m wide. So the area of paper bought

---------------

 is length (in meters) multiplied by 0.5m (width). So cost = (price per meter) * length.

---------------

 Because you buy L meters, each costing Rs.2, and each meter gives 0.5 m² of paper.

---------------

 So the area of paper is L * 0.5, and the cost is L * 2.

But wait, the

---------------

 cost is 260 Rs. So 260 = L * 2, so L = 130 meters. Hmm

---------------

, that's a lot. Wait, but that can't be right because 130 meters of paper is way too long for a room. Maybe

---------------

 I got that wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the cost is based on the area of the paper. Let me think again. The

---------------

 paper is 50 cm wide, so 0.5 meters. The price is Rs.2 per meter. Oh

---------------

 wait, per linear meter of paper. So, each linear meter is 0.5m wide and 1m long, so area per meter is 0.5 m². So

---------------

 the cost per m² of paper would be (2 Rs) / (0.5 m²) = 4 Rs per m². Wait

---------------

, no. Because you're buying 1m of paper, which is 0.5m², and you pay Rs.2 for that. So the

---------------

 cost per square meter is 2 Rs / 0.5 m² = 4 Rs/m². Hmm, but

---------------

 I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe the cost is calculated as the area of the walls (

---------------

minus doors and windows) times the price per m². Wait, but the problem states the cost is Rs.260 for

---------------

 papering, allowing 15 sq.m for doors and windows.

Wait, perhaps the total area of the walls is equal

---------------

 to the area covered by the paper minus the 15 sq.m. Or wait, the papering area is the wall

---------------

 area minus the doors and windows.

Let me clarify. The problem says, "allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows." So when

---------------

 they paper the walls, they don't cover the doors and windows, so the area of paper used is (total wall area) minus 15.

But

---------------

 how do we find the total wall area? The wall area (excluding doors and windows) is equal to the perimeter of the room multiplied by the height,

---------------

 minus the 15 sq.m.

Wait, no, wait. The total area of the four walls is 2*(L + W)*H. So

---------------

 that's the total wall area. But when papering, they don't cover the doors and windows, so the area of

---------------

 paper used is (2*(L+W)*H) - 15.

But the paper is bought in a certain width

---------------

. So the area of the paper used would be equal to the length of paper (let's say 'x' meters) multiplied by the width of the paper (0.5m). So,

---------------

 x * 0.5 = (2*(L + W)*H) - 15.

The cost is calculated

---------------

 as x meters of paper at Rs.2 per meter, so cost is 2*x = 260 Rs. So x

---------------

 = 130 meters. So, 130 m * 0.5 m = 65 m² is

---------------

 the area of paper used.

So, 65 m² = (2*(L + W)*H) - 15.

Wait

---------------

, because 2*(L+W)*H is the total wall area, and subtracting 15 for doors and windows gives the papered area,

---------------

 which is 65 m².

So, 2*(L+W)*H -15 = 65 →

---------------

 2*(L+W)*H = 80 → (L+W)*H =40.

But from the first

---------------

 part, the ratio H:S =2:5, and S is (L+W)/2. So H / [ (L+W)/2 ] = 2/5 → H * 2 / (L + W) )=2/5 → (

---------------

2H)/(L+W) )=2/5 → (H)/(L+W) )=1/5 → H

---------------

 = (L+W)/5.

So, from this, (L+W) =5 H.

Now, substitute into (L + W) * H =40 →

---------------

 5H * H =40 →5 H²=40 → H²=8 → H= sqrt(8) �

---------------

� 2.828 m.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are 2.828. The

---------------

 options are A)2.6, B)3.9, C)4, D)4.2, E)4.4.

Hmm, that

---------------

's confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.

Let me go through again.

First, the cost: 260 Rs.

---------------

 The paper is 50 cm wide, Rs.2 per meter.

So, the length of paper bought is cost / (price per meter) → 260 / 2 = 130 meters. So 

---------------

130 meters of paper, each 0.5m wide, so area is 130 * 0.5 = 65 m².

That

---------------

's correct. So the papered area is 65 m².

But the papered area is the total wall area minus the doors and windows:

---------------

 2*(L+W)*H -15 =65 → 2*(L+W)*H =80 → (L + W)*H =40.

From

---------------

 the ratio: H:S=2:5, S is semi-perimeter (S= (L+W)/2).

So H /

---------------

 S =2/5 → H / [(L+W)/2] =2/5 → 2H/(L+W) =2/5 → H/(L+W)=1/5 → H

---------------

 = (L + W)/5 → (L+W)=5H.

Substituting into (L+W)*H=40 → 5H * H=40 →5 H²=40 → H²=8 → H=√

---------------

8=2√2≈2.828 m.

Hmm, but that's not among the options. So I

---------------

 must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the doors and windows area is 15 m², so the total wall area is

---------------

 (paper area) + 15. Because when you paper, you cover the walls except doors and windows. So the

---------------

 paper area is (total wall area) minus 15.

Wait, no. The paper covers the walls, but not

---------------

 the doors. So the area of paper used is (total wall area) minus 15. So, yes, paper

---------------

 area = total wall area - 15.

Wait, but earlier I thought 65 = total wall area -15, leading

---------------

 to total wall area =80. Which is correct. So, 2*(L+W)*H=80.

Then

---------------

, using H = (L+W)/5 → substituting, (L+W)=5H.

So 2*(5H)*H=80 →10 H²=80 →H²=8 →H=2.828.



---------------

But options don't have that. So perhaps I messed up the ratio.

Wait, the ratio is H:S=2:5. S

---------------

 is the semi-perimeter, which is (L + W)/2.

So H/S =2/5 → H =

---------------

 (2/5) S → S= (5/2) H.

But S is semi-perimeter, so (L + W)/2 = (5/2) H → L + W =5 H.

Yes

---------------

, that's what I did earlier.

So (L + W) =5 H.

Putting into (L + W)*H=40 →5 H * H=40 →5

---------------

 H²=40 → H²=8 →H=2.828 m.

Hmm, that's about

---------------

 2.83 meters, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the semi-perimeter refers to the perimeter, not the semi. Let me check the problem statement again.

No, the problem says "

---------------

the height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5." So semi-perimeter is correct.

Wait, maybe

---------------

 I'm miscalculating the wall area.

Wait, the wall area is 2*(L + W)*H.

Yes

---------------

, because for a rectangle, there are two walls of length L and height H, and two walls of width W and height H. So total

---------------

 area is 2LH + 2WH = 2H(L + W).

So that part is correct.

Wait

---------------

, maybe I made a mistake in the paper area calculation.

Let me think again. The paper is 50 cm wide, which

---------------

 is 0.5 m, and the cost is Rs.2 per meter. So each meter of paper is 1m long and 0.5m wide, so area

---------------

 per meter is 0.5 m². The cost per meter is Rs.2, so per square meter, the

---------------

 cost is 2 Rs /0.5 m² =4 Rs/m².

So the total area of paper used is 65 m²,

---------------

 as I found before. So the cost is 65 *4 =260 Rs. That's correct.

So

---------------

 that part is correct.

Hmm, but the height I'm getting is about 2.83 m, which isn't among

---------------

 the options. So maybe I made a mistake in the ratio.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is H:S = 2:5, but

---------------

 S is the perimeter, not the semi-perimeter.

Wait, let me recheck the problem statement: "the height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5." So the

---------------

 ratio is H:S =2:5, with S being semi-perimeter.

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the wall area is (perimeter) * H. Perimeter is 2(L + W), so 2*(L+W)*

---------------

H. Which is the same as 2H(L+W).

Wait, but in the ratio, S is semi-perimeter, so S

---------------

=(L+W)/2.

So, H/S=2/5 → H= (2/5) * (L + W)/2 → H = (L+W)/5 → same

---------------

 as before.

Hmm, so I'm stuck. Maybe I should try the options given and see which one fits.

Looking at the options, let

---------------

's try option B)3.9 m.

If H=3.9 m, then from H = (L + W)/5 → L + W =5 *3.9=19.5 m.

Then, (

---------------

L + W)*H =19.5 *3.9 → let's compute 19.5 *3.9.



---------------

19.5 *3=58.5, 19.5 *0.9=17.55. Sum is 58.5 +17.55=76.05.

So

---------------

 (L + W)*H=76.05, which was supposed to be 40. That's way higher

---------------

.

Hmm, not matching.

Option C)4m.

H=4. So L + W=5*4=20.

(L

---------------

 + W)*H=20 *4=80.

Which was supposed to be 40. So that's double.

---------------

 So that can't be right.

Wait, no, because in our equation, (L+W)*H =40.

---------------

 So if (L+W)*H=80, that would require 2*(L + W)*H=160, but earlier

---------------

 we have 2*(L+W)*H=80.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the equation.

Wait, let

---------------

 me re-express.

Earlier, I thought 2*(L + W)*H -15 =65 → 

---------------

2*(L + W)*H=80 → (L + W)*H=40.

But wait, maybe

---------------

 I got the equation wrong. Let me think again.

The paper area is 65 m², which equals the wall area minus 15.



---------------

So, 65 = (2*(L + W)*H) -15 → 2*(L + W)*H =80 → (L + W)*H=40.

So

---------------

 if (L + W)*H=40, and (L + W)=5H, then substituting:

5H * H=40 →5H²=40 → H²=8 → H=2.828 m.

But

---------------

 none of the options match. So perhaps the mistake is in the way I calculated the paper area.

Wait, another approach: perhaps

---------------

 the paper's length is equal to the perimeter, and the width is 0.5m. So the paper area is perimeter * 0.5.



---------------

Wait, but paper is used to cover the walls, which have a height H and a perimeter of 2(L + W). So

---------------

 the total area is 2(L + W)*H.

Wait, but how much paper is used? The paper is 

---------------

0.5m wide, so each strip covers 0.5m width and H meters height. So the length of paper needed per

---------------

 strip is H / 0.5, but wait, perhaps it's more complicated.

Alternatively, the total area to cover is 2*(L + W)*H.

---------------

 The paper is 0.5m wide and of length x meters, so the area is 0.5x. But

---------------

 since the paper has to cover the walls, perhaps the paper's area must be equal to the wall area minus the 15.



---------------

So, 0.5x = (2*(L + W)*H) -15 → x = [2*(L + W)*H -15 ] / 0.5 =

---------------

 2*(2*(L + W)*H -15) → x =4*(L + W)*H -30.

The

---------------

 cost is x meters * Rs.2 per meter → 2x =260 → x=130.

So,

---------------

 4*(L + W)*H -30 =130 →4*(L + W)*H=160 → (L + W)*H=40.

Same

---------------

 as before. So, same equation.

So, (L + W)*H=40.

Hmm. Let's think

---------------

 about the options again. Maybe I made a mistake in the ratio.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is H:S=5:2,

---------------

 not 2:5. Let me recheck the problem statement.

No, the problem says "the height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5." So H:S=2:5,

---------------

 which I have correctly applied.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the area of the paper. Let me think about

---------------

 this again.

The paper is 50 cm wide, so each strip of paper is 0.5 m wide. To

---------------

 cover a wall of height H, how much paper do you need?

Each strip covers 0.5 m width and H meters height. So each

---------------

 strip has an area of 0.5 * H.

But the total area to cover is 2*(L + W)*H.

---------------

 So the number of strips needed is [2*(L + W)*H ] / (0.5 * H) )= 4*(L + W).

So

---------------

 the total length of paper needed is 4*(L + W) meters.

Wait, because each strip is 0.5m wide and H

---------------

 meters tall. So for each strip, you use H meters of paper. Because the paper is 0.5m wide, but

---------------

 you need to cover H meters height. Wait, perhaps each strip is H meters long.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let

---------------

 me think differently. The area to cover is 2*(L + W)*H. The paper is 0.5m wide, so the

---------------

 length of paper needed is (2*(L + W)*H) / 0.5 =4*(L + W)*H.

So

---------------

 the cost is length * price per meter. So cost=4*(L + W)*H *2 Rs/m → 

---------------

8*(L + W)*H=260 → (L + W)*H=260/8=32.5.

Wait, earlier

---------------

 I thought (L + W)*H=40, but that was based on another approach. Now, this approach gives

---------------

 (L + W)*H=32.5.

Hmm, that's a different result. So which approach is correct?

Wait

---------------

, perhaps I should model it correctly. The paper's area is 0.5 m (width) multiplied by the length of

---------------

 the paper. So paper area=0.5 * x, where x is the length in meters.

The paper area must

---------------

 equal the wall area minus 15.

So 0.5x = (2*(L + W)*H) -15 → x=2*(2*(L + W)*H -15)

---------------

 =4*(L + W)*H -30.

The cost is x * 2 Rs/m → 2*(4*(L + W)*H -30) =260 → 8*(L + W)*H -60=260 →8*(L + W)*H=320 → (L + W)*H=40.

Which

---------------

 brings us back to the same equation. So the initial approach was correct.

So (L + W)*H=40.

And

---------------

 H = (L + W)/5 → substituting, (L + W) =5H.

So, 5H * H=40 →5 H²=40 →H²=8 →H=2√2≈

---------------

2.828 m.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem has a typo, or I made

---------------

 a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the semi-perimeter is (L + W), not (L + W)/2.

Wait, no

---------------

. Wait, semi-perimeter is half the perimeter. Perimeter is 2*(L + W). So semi-perimeter is (L + W).

Wait

---------------

, no. Wait, semi-perimeter is (L + W)/2? No. Wait, no. Wait, no

---------------

. Wait, perimeter is 2(L + W). So semi-perimeter is (L + W).

Wait, no!

---------------

 Wait, no. Wait, perimeter is 2(L + W). So semi-perimeter is (perimeter)/2 =

---------------

 (2(L + W))/2 = L + W.

Wait, that changes everything! Oh! I think I made a mistake here.

So

---------------

 the semi-perimeter S = (L + W). Because S is perimeter /2, which is 2(L+W)/2 = L + W.

Wait

---------------

, yes! That's the mistake. So S = L + W.

So the ratio H:S=2:5 → H/(L+W) = 2/5 → H = (2/5)(L+W).

So

---------------

 earlier, I thought S was (L + W)/2, which was wrong. Oh! That's a big mistake.

So,

---------------

 now let's correct that.

So, H = (2/5)(L + W).

So, (L + W) = (5/2) H.

Now

---------------

, from the wall area:

(L + W)*H =40 → (5/2 H ) * H =40 → (5/2) H²=40 → H²= (40 * 2)/5 → H²=16 → H=4 m.

Ah

---------------

! Now, 4 m is option C.

That makes sense. So the correct answer is C)4m.


The problem involves determining the height of a room given the following conditions:

1. **Height to Semi-Perimeter Ratio**: The height \( H \) of the room to its semi-perimeter \( S \) is given as \( 2:5 \). Since the semi-perimeter of a rectangular room is \( S = L + W \) (where \( L \) and \( W \) are the length and width of the room), the ratio can be expressed as:
   \[
   \frac{H}{S} = \frac{2}{5} \implies H = \frac{2}{5}(L + W).
   \]

2. **Wall Papering Cost**: The cost to paper the walls is Rs. 260, using paper that is 50 cm wide (0.5 m) at Rs. 2 per meter. Additionally, 15 sq

---------------

.m is allowed for doors and windows. The total paper area used is:
   \[
   \text{Paper Area} = \text{Length of Paper} \times \text{Width of Paper}.
   \]
   The length of paper is

---------------

 calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Length of Paper} = \frac{\text{Cost}}{\text{Price per Meter}} = \frac{260}{2} = 130 \, \text{m}.
   \]
   Thus, the paper area is:
   \[
   \text{Paper Area} = 130 \times 0.5 = 65 \, \text{m}^2.
   \]

3. **Wall Area Calculation**: The total wall area (excluding doors and windows) is given by:
   \[
   \text{Total Wall Area} = 2(L + W)H.
   \]
   Since the paper area is

---------------

 the total wall area minus the area for doors and windows:
   \[
   65 = 2(L + W)H - 15 \implies 2(L + W)H = 80 \implies (L + W)H = 40.
   \]

4. **Substituting the Height Ratio**: From the height-to-semi-perimeter ratio, \( H = \frac{2}{5}(L + W) \), we can express \( L + W \) as:
   \[
   L + W = \frac{5}{2}H.
   \]
   Substituting this into \( (L + W)H = 40 \):
   \[
   \left(\frac{5}{2}H\right)H = 40 \implies \frac{5}{2}H^2 = 40 \implies H^2 = 16 \implies H = 4 \, \text{m}.
   \]

Thus, the height of the room is **4 meters**, which corresponds to option **C**.
