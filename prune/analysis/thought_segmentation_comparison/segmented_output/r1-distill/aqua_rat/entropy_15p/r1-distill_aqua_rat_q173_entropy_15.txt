Okay, so I've got this problem here about tires and costs. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what

---------------

's being asked.

The question is about the average cost per year for new tires versus repairing the current ones. So, the

---------------

 tires from a certain brand last four years when new. The customer has two options: buy new tires for $180 each, or repair the current tires for $40 each, which extends

---------------

 their life by one year. I need to find out by what percentage the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing.

Hmm, so

---------------

 I think I should calculate the average cost per year for both options and then compare them to find the percentage increase.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, the

---------------

 new tires. Each tire costs $180. They last for four years. So, the total cost for the new tires is $180 per tire. Since

---------------

 each tire is used for four years, the average cost per year would be the total cost divided by the number of years.

---------------

 So, 180 divided by 4.

Wait, let me calculate that. 180 /4 equals 45. So, the average cost per year for new tires is $45.

Now, the repair option. The customer can repair their

---------------

 current tires for $40 each. This repair makes the tires last one additional year. Wait, so the original life of

---------------

 the tires is four years. If they repair them, they get an extra year, making it five years total?

Wait, no

---------------

, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The question says, "when purchased new, last for four years." So, the current tires are

---------------

 already in use. So, if the customer repairs them, how much longer will they last?

Wait, the question says,

---------------

 "a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year." So, if the current tires are, say, x

---------------

 years old, they would last x+1 more years after repair. But wait, no, perhaps the repair adds one year to

---------------

 their lifespan regardless of how old they are. Alternatively, maybe the repair just extends the current lifespan by one year beyond the four years.



---------------

Wait, maybe it's better to think of it this way: the customer's current tires are already four years old. Because

---------------

 when new, they last four years. So, if they repair them, they can use them for one more year, making the

---------------

 total five years. But wait, perhaps the current tires are not necessarily four years old yet. Hmm, the problem isn't clear

---------------

 on that.

Wait, perhaps the way to approach it is that the current tires, without repair, have some life left. But

---------------

 the repair extends that by one year. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires have already been in use for a certain period, and the

---------------

 repair gives them an additional year beyond their original four.

Wait, maybe the problem is assuming that the current tires are about to fail or

---------------

 something. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently.

The problem says that purchasing new tires costs

---------------

 $180 each, which lasts four years. Alternatively, repairing the current tires for $40 each will make them last for one more year. So, perhaps

---------------

 the current tires are about to expire, and by repairing, they can get one more year.

Wait, but for the purpose

---------------

 of calculating the average cost per year, maybe the initial state is that the customer is at the point where they can choose to buy new tires or repair the current ones.

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps the current tires have already been used for a certain period, but I think the problem is simplifying things. Maybe

---------------

 I should model it as the cost per year when you choose to buy new tires versus repair the existing ones, and see which is cheaper on a per-year basis.

Wait

---------------

, perhaps the current tires are in their fourth year, and the customer is deciding whether to replace them or repair them. So

---------------

, if he repairs, he can get one more year, making it five years total? Or does the repair make the current

---------------

 tires last for four years again, adding one year beyond their original four? Hmm.

Wait, the question says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, if

---------------

 the current tires are already in use, say, for three years, repairing them would make them last one more year, so

---------------

 they would be good for four years from the time of repair. Or perhaps the current tires are new, and the customer is

---------------

 choosing to repair them, but that doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the current tires have already been used for a

---------------

 certain time, but the problem doesn't specify. Maybe it's better to model each option as a separate scenario.

Option 1: Buy new tires for $180 each. Each

---------------

 tire will last four years. So, the average cost per year is 180 /4 = $45 per year.

Option 2: Repair current tires for $40 each, which adds

---------------

 one more year to their life. So, if the current tires are about to last, say, x years, then after

---------------

 repair, they last x+1 years. But without knowing x, how do I compute the average cost?

Wait, maybe

---------------

 the problem is implying that the current tires are already four years old. So, if you repair them, they will last one more year, making

---------------

 it five years total.

Wait, but then the total lifespan would be five years, and the repair cost is $40 per

---------------

 tire. So, for each tire, you pay $40 and get one extra year. So, the average cost per year would

---------------

 be the repair cost divided by the additional year.

Wait, but perhaps the total cost for the repair option is $40 per tire, and the

---------------

 tire lasts for an additional year beyond what it would have otherwise. So, perhaps without repair, the tire would last four years, and with repair, it's five years. So

---------------

, the cost per year would be 40 /1 = $40 per year.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps the cost is $40 for an additional year. So, for each tire, you pay $40 and get one

---------------

 more year, so the cost per year is 40 /1 = 40. So, the average cost per year for

---------------

 the repair option is $40.

Wait, but that can't be right because if I'm comparing the average cost per year,

---------------

 I have to look at the total cost over the lifespan.

Wait, maybe the way to think about it is: for each

---------------

 tire, the cost of repair is $40, and this extends its life by one year. So, if the original

---------------

 life was four years, the new life is five years.

So, for the repair option, each tire's cost is $40, but it

---------------

's used for five years. So the average cost per year would be 40 /5 = $8 per year.

Wait, that

---------------

 seems low. But let me think again.

Wait, no. Because the repair cost is $40 for an additional year. So, without

---------------

 repair, the tire would last four years, and with repair, it's five years. So, the total cost for the repair option is $40 for

---------------

 each tire, and it's used for five years. So, the average cost per year is 40 /5 = 8 dollars per year.

But

---------------

 wait, the original cost of the tire when new is $180. So, if the customer already owns the tire, the

---------------

 repair is an additional $40 to get one more year. So, perhaps the total cost for the repair option is the

---------------

 cost of the tire plus the repair? No, wait, no. Because the customer is choosing to repair their current tires,

---------------

 not buy new ones. So, the cost is only $40 per tire for the repair, which adds one year to the life

---------------

.

But wait, the problem says the customer can choose to purchase new tires or have his current tires repaired. So, if

---------------

 he chooses to repair, he's paying $40 per tire, which extends the current tires' life by one year.

So

---------------

, the current tires are already in use. Let's say they have been used for x years. But without knowing x, perhaps

---------------

 the problem is simplifying it. Maybe the current tires have been used for four years already and are about to fail, so repairing

---------------

 them adds one more year. So, the total lifespan becomes five years for the repair option.

Wait, but that might not be the case. Alternatively

---------------

, maybe the current tires are in their first year, and the repair adds one more year, making them last two years. But

---------------

 the problem states that when new, the tires last four years. So, perhaps the current tires are new, but the customer is considering

---------------

 repair instead of buying new.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. The customer has current tires and is considering whether to repair them or buy new ones. So

---------------

, perhaps the current tires are in their fourth year, and the customer can repair them for $40 each, making them last for

---------------

 one more year (so five years total). Alternatively, he can buy new ones for $180 each, which will last four years.

Wait

---------------

, but that would mean the new tires would last four years, whereas the repaired tires would last five years. So, perhaps

---------------

 the average cost per year for the new tires is 180/4 = 45, and for the repaired tires, it's 40/5 = 8?

---------------

 That seems a big difference, but let me see.

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering the initial cost of the tires

---------------

 as part of the calculation. So, if the customer buys new tires, he spends $180 and uses them for four years. The

---------------

 average cost is 180/4=45 per year.

If he repairs his current tires, he spends $40,

---------------

 and they last one more year. Wait, but without knowing how much longer the tires would have lasted without repair, it's a

---------------

 bit tricky. Maybe the problem is assuming that the current tires are about to wear out, and the repair gives one more year.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the current tires have already been used for four years, and repairing them for $40 would make them last one

---------------

 more year, so five years total.

In that case, the average cost for the repair option would be 40/

---------------

5 =8 per year.

So, comparing the two:

New tires: $45/year.

Repair: $8/year.

Wait

---------------

, but that would mean the new tires are more expensive, but the question is asking by what percentage the new tires' average cost is greater than the repair cost.

So, the

---------------

 question is: what percent greater is 45 than 8?

To find the percentage increase, the formula is ((new - old)/old)*100%.

So, (45-8)/8 *100% = (37/8)*100% = 4.625 * 100% = 462.5%?

---------------

 That can't be right because the options don't have that. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 I'm not correctly modeling the repair option. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: Maybe the repair is done each year, but

---------------

 that doesn't fit with the problem statement. The problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, it

---------------

's a one-time repair.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the cost per year for the entire lifespan of the tires,

---------------

 considering whether to buy new or repair once.

Let me try a different approach. Let's model the cost over the same period of

---------------

 time for both options.

Suppose we're looking at a period of four years.

Option 1: Buy new tires for

---------------

 $180 each. They last four years. So, the cost is $180, and you get four years of use. So, average cost per year is 180/4 =45.

Option 2: Repair current tires. The

---------------

 repair costs $40 and extends their life by one year. So, if the current tires are about to last for x

---------------

 years, then after repair, they last x+1 years. But without knowing x, perhaps the problem is considering that the current

---------------

 tires are in their first year, and repairing them adds one more year, making them last two years.

Wait, but that

---------------

 seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires are about to fail after four years, so the customer is at the point where the

---------------

 tires are four years old. So, he can buy new ones for $180, which will last another four years, or repair them for $40, which will

---------------

 make them last one more year (so five years total from the original purchase).

Wait, but the initial purchase of the current tires would

---------------

 have cost $180, but the customer isn't buying them again. He's considering whether to repair his current tires (

---------------

which cost him $180 when he bought them four years ago) or buy new ones.

But I'm overcomplicating it

---------------

. Maybe the problem is only considering the cost of the repair versus the cost of new tires, and the life they provide.

Wait

---------------

, perhaps the way to think about it is:

If the customer chooses to buy new tires, he pays $180 for each tire, which lasts four years. So, the

---------------

 cost per year is 180/4 =45.

If he chooses to repair, he pays $40 per

---------------

 tire, and the tires last one more year. So, the cost per year is 40/(1) =40 per

---------------

 year.

Wait, that would make the average cost for repair 40 per year, and new is 45 per year. So, the new

---------------

 tires are 5 more per year than repair. So, the percentage increase would be (5/40)*100% =12.5%.

Wait

---------------

, that's one of the options, option C.

But wait, why would the repair option be 40 per year? Because the

---------------

 repair gives one more year, so the cost is 40 for that extra year. So, the average cost per year would

---------------

 be 40 divided by 1, which is 40.

So, the new tires are 45 per year, repair is 40 per year. The difference

---------------

 is 5. So, 5 is what percentage of 40? 5/40 is 0.125, which is 12.5% increase

---------------

. So, the answer would be C)12.5%.

Alternatively, perhaps the repair gives an extra year, so the total

---------------

 life is four years (original) plus one, making five. So, the average cost per year would be 40/5=8. Then

---------------

, the new tires are 45, which is 45-8=37 more per year. 37/8 is 4.625, which is 462.5% increase. But that's not an option, so that

---------------

 approach must be wrong.

Hmm, so I think the correct way is that the repair cost is $40 for an additional year beyond the

---------------

 current lifespan. So, the current tires are about to last for, say, x years, and the repair makes it x+1. But without

---------------

 knowing x, perhaps the problem is considering that the customer is at the point where the tires are about to fail, so the

---------------

 repair gives one more year.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the customer is looking to have the tires last for a

---------------

 certain period, and the options are to buy new (four years) or repair (five years), but the cost is for

---------------

 each tire.

Wait, but perhaps the question is comparing the average cost per year when you choose to buy new tires versus repairing

---------------

. So, for the new tires, the cost is 180 for four years. The repair is 40, which

---------------

 gives one more year, so the total life is five years.

Wait, no, the repair is a one-time cost to

---------------

 add one year. So, for each tire, the cost is 40, and the tire lasts one more year.

---------------

 So, the average cost per year would be 40 divided by 1, which is 40.

So, comparing

---------------

 45 (new) to 40 (repair), the new is 5 more per year. 5/40 is 0.125, which is 12.5% higher. So, the answer is C.

Wait

---------------

, but let me think again. The problem says, "the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?"

So, the

---------------

 average cost per year for new is 45, for repair is 40. So, the new is 45, which is 5 more than 40. So, 

---------------

5/40 = 12.5% higher.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer is C)12.5%.


To determine the percentage by which the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires, we analyze both options:

### Option 1: New Tires
- **Cost per tire**: $180  
- **Lifespan**: 4 years  
- **Average cost per year**:  
  \[
  \frac{\$180}{4} = \$45
  \]

### Option 2: Repairing Current Tires
- **Cost per tire**: $40  
- **Additional lifespan**: 1 year  
- **Total lifespan after repair**: 5 years (assuming the tires were originally designed to last 4 years)  
- **Average cost per year**:  
  \[
  \frac{\$40}{5} = \$8
  \]

### Comparison
The average cost per year for new tires is \$45, and for repaired tires, it is \$8. To find the percentage by which \$45 is greater than \$8, we use the formula for percentage increase:  
\[
\text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Difference}}{\text{Original}} \right) \times 100\%
\]  
\[
\text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$45 - \$8}{\$8} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{\$37}{\$8} \right) \times 100\% = 462.5\%
\]

However, this result does not align with the problem

---------------

's intent. Reconsidering the repair option, if the repair cost of \$40 is solely for the additional year, the average cost per year for the repair is:  
\[
\frac{\$40}{1} = \$40
\]  
Now, comparing \$45 (new tires) to \$40 (repair):  
\[
\text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$45 - \$40}{\$40} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{\$5}{\$40} \right) \times 100\% = 12.5\%
\]

Thus, the average cost per year of new tires is **12.5% greater** than the cost of repairing the current tires.
