Okay, so I've got this problem here about a worker who drives to work and then cycles the same route. I need to find out how long it takes to

---------------

 cycle. Let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, the problem says it takes the worker 9 minutes to drive at

---------------

 20 km/h. I guess I need to find the distance first because once I have the distance, I can figure

---------------

 out the time it takes to cycle at 6 km/h.

Wait, right. Time, speed, and distance are related by the formula: distance = speed × time. But wait, the time here is in minutes, and the speed is in km per hour. So

---------------

 I need to convert the time to hours to match the units.

So the driving time is 9 minutes. To convert that into hours, I divide by 60 because there are 60 minutes in an hour. 9 divided by 60 is 0.15 hours. Let

---------------

 me double-check that: 9/60 = 0.15, yeah.

Now, using the formula, distance equals speed multiplied by time. The driving speed is 20 km/h, so distance = 20 * 0.15. Let's calculate that. 20 * 0.15 is 3. So the distance from home to work is 3 kilometers. That

---------------

 makes sense because 20 km/h for 9 minutes would cover 3 km.

Now, the next part is the

---------------

 cycling. The worker cycles at 6 km/h. Again, using the same formula, but this time I need to find the time. So time equals distance divided by speed.

The

---------------

 distance is still 3 km, and the cycling speed is 6 km/h. So time = 3 / 6. That equals 0.5 hours. Oh

---------------

 wait, 0.5 hours is 30 minutes, right? Because 0.5 * 60 minutes is 30.

Wait

---------------

, but looking at the options, option A is 30. So that should be the answer. But wait, let

---------------

 me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Another way to think about it: The worker's driving time is 9 minutes for 3 km. So

---------------

 the time for cycling would be longer since the speed is lower. 30 minutes is longer than 9, which makes sense because cycling is slower.

Wait

---------------

, but wait. Let me re-calculate the cycling time. 3 km divided by 6 km/h is 0.5 hours, which is 30 minutes. Yep

---------------

, that's correct.

So the answer should be A)30.


To determine how long it takes the worker to cycle from home to work, we first calculate the distance of the route using the driving information. The worker drives at an average speed of 20 km/h for 9 minutes. Converting 9 minutes to hours gives:

\[
\text{Time (hours)} = \frac{9}{60} = 0.15 \, \text{hours}.
\]

Using the formula for distance:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time},
\]

we find:

\[
\text{Distance} = 20 \, \text{km/h} \times 0.15 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{km}.
\]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to cycle the same 3 km at an average speed of 6 km/h. Using the formula for time:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}},
\]

we find:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{3 \, \text{km}}{6 \, \text{km/h}} = 0.5 \, \text{hours}.
\]

Converting 0.5 hours to minutes:

\[
\text{Time (minutes)} = 0.5 \times 60 = 30 \, \text{minutes}.
\]

Thus, it takes the worker 30 minutes to cycle from home to work. The correct answer is:
