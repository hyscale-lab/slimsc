Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.



---------------

The problem says that events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6. Also, the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. I need to find the probability that event B occurs.

Hmm, right

---------------

. So, since A and B are independent, that means the occurrence of one doesn't affect the other. I remember that for

---------------

 independent events, the probability of both happening is the product of their individual probabilities. So P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).

But

---------------

 wait, the question is about the probability that at least one occurs. Oh right, the formula for the probability of at least one of two events occurring is P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Since

---------------

 they are independent, P(A and B) is P(A) * P(B), so substituting that in, it becomes P(A) + P(B) - P(A)*P(B).

Given

---------------

 that P(A or B) is 0.96, and P(A) is 0.6, I can plug those into the equation.



---------------

Let me write that down:

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)*P(B)
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B))

Hmm

---------------

, let's simplify the right side. So 0.6 + P(B) minus 0.6 P(B). Let

---------------

 me factor that.

0.6 + P(B)(1 - 0.6) = 0.6 + 0.4 * P(B)

So the

---------------

 equation becomes 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4 P(B)

Now I'll subtract 0.6 from both sides to isolate the term with P(B).

0.96 - 0.6 = 0.4 P(B)
0.36 = 0.4 P(B)

So

---------------

 P(B) is 0.36 divided by 0.4. Let's calculate that.

0.36 / 0.4 is

---------------

 the same as 36/40, which simplifies to 9/10, so 0.9.



---------------

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because if P(B) is 0.9, then let me check if

---------------

 that makes sense.

Let me plug back in to the original equation:

P(A or B) = 0.6 + 0.9 - (0.6 * 0.9)
So

---------------

 that's 0.6 + 0.9 = 1.5. Then subtract 0.54 (

---------------

since 0.6 * 0.9 is 0.54). 1.5 - 0.54 is 0.96, which matches the given value.

Oh

---------------

, wait, but the options don't have E as 0.9 as the correct answer. Wait, let me check the options again.

Wait

---------------

, the options are A)0.5, B)0.6, C)0.7, D)0.8, E)0.9. So E

---------------

 is 0.9. So that would be the correct answer, right?

But wait a second, I thought that maybe

---------------

 I made a mistake because 0.9 seems high. Let me think again.

If P(A) is 0.6 and P(B) is 0.9, then the probability that at least one occurs is 0.96. So

---------------

 that's correct because 0.6 + 0.9 = 1.5, minus 0.54 is

---------------

 0.96. So yes, that's correct.

So the probability of B is 0.9, which is option E.

Wait, but I

---------------

 just thought that if B is 0.9, then the probability of at least one is 0.96, which is

---------------

 even higher than both. That's possible because when they are independent, their combined probabilities can sometimes sum beyond 1, but the

---------------

 formula correctly subtracts the overlap.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me do the steps again.

0

---------------

.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6 P(B)
Which is 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B)(1 - 0.6)
So

---------------

 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4 P(B)
Subtract 0.6: 0.36 = 0.4 P(B)
Div

---------------

ide both sides by 0.4: P(B) = 0.36 / 0.4 = 0.9.

Yes

---------------

, that's correct. So the answer should be E)0.9.


The problem involves two independent events, A and B. The probability that event A occurs is given as \( P(A) = 0.6 \), and the probability that at least one of the events occurs is \( P(A \text{ or } B) = 0.96 \). The goal is to find \( P(B) \).

Since A and B are independent, the probability of both events occurring is \( P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \cdot P(B) \). The formula for the probability of at least one event occurring is:

\[
P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A) \cdot P(B)
\]

Substituting the known values \( P(A) = 0.6 \) and \( P(A \text{ or } B) = 0.96 \) into the equation:

\[
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 \cdot P(B))
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side:

\[
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B)(1 - 0.6)
\]

\[
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)
\]

Subtracting \( 0.6 \) from both sides:

\[
0.36 = 0.4P(B)
\]

Dividing both sides by \( 0.4 \):

\[
P(B) = \frac{0.36}{0.4} = 0.9
\]

To verify, substituting \( P(B) = 0.9 \) back into the formula for \( P(A \text{ or } B) \):

\[
P(A \text{ or } B) = 0.6 + 0.9 - (0.6 \cdot 0.9)
\]

\[
P(A \text{ or } B) = 0.6 + 0.9 - 0.54 = 0.96
\]

This matches the given value of \( P(A \text{ or } B) = 0.96 \), confirming that \( P(B) = 0.9 \).

Thus, the probability that event B occurs is **0.9**, which corresponds to option **E**.
