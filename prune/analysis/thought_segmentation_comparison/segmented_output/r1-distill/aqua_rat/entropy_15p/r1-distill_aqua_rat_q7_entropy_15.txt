Okay, so I have this problem here about a train's journey, and I need to figure out the total time it takes. Hmm, let me read

---------------

 it again carefully.

The train is running at 100 miles per hour and takes 10 hours to reach its destination. So

---------------

, wait, that means the total distance is speed multiplied by time. So 100 mph times 10 hours equals

---------------

 1000 miles. Oh, right, because distance equals speed multiplied by time. So the total distance is 1000 miles.

Now, the twist

---------------

 is that after covering a quarter of the distance, it starts raining, and the train slows down to 75 mph. So I need to calculate

---------------

 how much time the train takes for each part of the journey: the first quarter and the remaining three quarters.

First, let's find out how long the first quarter is. A

---------------

 quarter of 1000 miles is 250 miles. So the first part is 250 miles. The train was going at 100 mph for

---------------

 this part. To find the time taken, I can use the formula time = distance / speed. So 250 miles divided by 100 mph equals

---------------

 2.5 hours. That's the time for the first part.

Then, the remaining distance is 1000 minus 250, which is 750 miles. But

---------------

 now the train is moving slower, at 75 mph. So the time for this part is 750 divided by 75. Let me calculate that: 750 /75 is 10 hours. Wait

---------------

, that's interesting. So the first part took 2.5 hours, the second part takes 10 hours. So

---------------

 total time is 2.5 + 10 = 12.5 hours.

Wait, but the original time

---------------

 without any rain was 10 hours. Now, after the rain, the time is longer. So the options are A

---------------

)10, B)11.5, C)12.5, D)13.5, E)15. So the

---------------

 answer should be C)12.5.

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Total distance: 100 *10 =1000 miles. Correct

---------------

.

First quarter: 250 miles. Time taken: 250/100 = 2.5 hours. Correct

---------------

.

Remaining: 750 miles. Time: 750/75 =10 hours. Correct. Sum

---------------

 is 12.5. Yep, that's right.

So the answer is option C.


The train travels a total distance of \( 100 \, \text{mph} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 1000 \, \text{miles} \). After covering a quarter of the distance (250 miles), it slows down to 75 mph for the remaining 750 miles. 

For the first quarter:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{250}{100} = 2.5 \, \text{hours}.
\]

For the remaining three quarters:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{750}{75} = 10 \, \text{hours}.
\]

The total journey duration is:
\[
2.5 + 10 = 12.5 \, \text{hours}.
\]

Thus, the total journey duration is **12.5 hours**.
