Okay, so I've got this problem about John and his tea. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I

---------------

'm a bit rusty on mixtures and concentrations, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, the problem says John has a 50% strong milk tea. So

---------------

 that means half of the tea is milk and the other half is, well, tea, right? Wait, no, maybe I

---------------

'm getting that wrong. Wait, 50% strong milk tea—I think that refers to the concentration of milk in the tea. So 

---------------

50% milk and 50% tea. Because strong milk tea would have a higher concentration of milk, maybe,

---------------

 but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe it's 50% milk in the tea. So the initial solution is 50% milk.



---------------

So, he replaces 15% of it with milk twice. Wait, does that mean he does it two times? Or

---------------

 is it replacing 15% each time? Let me read that again: he replaces 15% of it with milk twice. Hmm, maybe

---------------

 he does it two times, each time replacing 15% of the solution with milk. So each time, he's

---------------

 taking 15% of the current mixture and replacing it with pure milk.

Wait, but wait, the first part says he

---------------

 replaces 15% of it with milk twice. So maybe that's two instances of replacing 15% each?

---------------

 Or maybe he replaces 15% each time, and does it twice. So, the first step is replacing 15% with

---------------

 milk, and then he does it again. Then, after that, he replaces 10% of the resultant solution with more milk.

So

---------------

 the process is:

1. Start with 50% milk tea.

2. Replace 15% of it with milk.

---------------

 Do this twice.

3. Then, replace 10% of the resultant solution with milk.

And we need to find the final concentration of tea.

---------------

 Wait, wait—concentration of tea? Or milk? Because the question says "the final concentration of tea John drinks." So we

---------------

're looking for the percentage of tea left in the solution.

Wait, but wait, because when you add milk, you're increasing

---------------

 the milk concentration and decreasing the tea concentration. So each time he replaces some of the mixture with milk, he's diluting the tea,

---------------

 right?

Hmm, let me think about each step.

Let's assume the initial volume is 100 units for simplicity. So

---------------

 100 units of 50% milk tea. That's 50 units milk and 50 units tea.

First replacement

---------------

: he replaces 15% of it with milk. So 15% of 100 units is 15 units. So

---------------

 he removes 15 units of the mixture and replaces it with 15 units of milk.

Wait, but when you replace a portion of the mixture, the amount

---------------

 of milk and tea removed depends on their current concentrations. So the first time, the mixture is 50% milk. So in

---------------

 the 15 units removed, there's 7.5 units of milk and 7.5 units of tea. Then

---------------

 he adds 15 units of milk.

So the new mixture after first replacement:

Milk: 50 -7.5 +15 = 57.5 units.

Tea: 50 -7.5 =42.5 units.

So the

---------------

 concentration of milk is 57.5 / 100 = 57.5%, tea is 42.5%.

Then

---------------

 he does this again: replaces 15% of the mixture with milk. So again, 15 units of the current mixture are

---------------

 removed and replaced with 15 units milk.

The current mixture is 57.5% milk. So in 15 units removed, the

---------------

 milk is 0.575 *15 =8.625 units, and tea is 15 -8.625=6.375 units.

So

---------------

 after replacement:

Milk: 57.5 -8.625 +15 = (57.5 +6.375) =

---------------

 63.875 units.

Wait wait, no: 57.5 minus 8.625 is 48.875, plus 15 added

---------------

 gives 63.875.

Tea: 42.5 -6.375 =36.125 units.

So now

---------------

 the mixture is 63.875 milk and 36.125 tea. So 63.875% milk, 36.125% tea.

Now

---------------

, the third step: he replaces 10% of the resultant solution with more milk.

So 10% of 100 is 10 units. He removes 10 units of the current mixture and replaces it with 10 units milk.

Current concentration is

---------------

 63.875% milk, so in 10 units removed, milk is 6.3875 units, tea is 3.6125 units.

After replacement:

Milk: 63.875 -6.3875 +10 = (63.875 + 3.6125) =

---------------

67.4875? Wait, wait no.

Wait, 63.875 -6.3875 = 57.4875. Then adding

---------------

 10 units milk: 57.4875 +10=67.4875 units milk.

Tea: 36.125 -3.6125 =32.5125 units.

So total

---------------

 volume is still 100 units.

So the concentration of tea is 32.5125% /

---------------

100 =32.5125%.

Looking at the options, option E is 32.51%. So that's

---------------

 the closest.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations, because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

First step: Initial

---------------

 50% milk.

After first replacement (15% with milk):

Milk: 50 - (0.15 *50) + 

---------------

0.15*100 = 50 -7.5 +15 =57.5.



---------------

Tea: 50 -7.5=42.5.

Second replacement: 15% of 

---------------

100 is 15 units.

Milk in removed: 0.575 *15=8.625.

So milk

---------------

 becomes 57.5 -8.625 +15 =63.875.

Tea becomes 42.5 - (15 -

---------------

8.625) =42.5-6.375=36.125.

Third step: 10% of

---------------

 100 is 10 units.

Milk in removed: 0.63875 *10=6.3875.

So milk becomes

---------------

 63.875 -6.3875 +10=67.4875.

Tea becomes 36.125 - (10 -6.3875)=36.125 -3.6125=32.5125.

So 

---------------

32.5125% tea, which is about 32.51%, matching option E.


To determine the final concentration of tea in John's drink, we analyze the process step by step:

1. **Initial Setup**: John starts with 100 units of a 50% milk tea solution. This means 50 units are milk and 50 units are tea.

2. **First Replacement**: John replaces 15% of the solution with milk. Since the mixture is 50% milk, 15% of 100 units (15 units) contains 7.5 units of milk and 7.5 units of tea. After removing these and adding 15 units of milk:
   - Milk: \( 50 - 7.5 + 15 = 57.5 \, \text{units} \)
   - Tea: \( 50 - 7.5 = 42.5 \, \text{units} \)
   The new concentrations are 57.5% milk and 42.5% tea.

3. **Second Replacement**: John repeats the process, replacing another 15% of the solution with milk. The mixture is now 57.5% milk, so 15 units removed contain \( 0.575 \times 15 = 8.625 \, \text{units} \) of milk and \( 15 - 8.625 = 6.375 \, \text{units} \) of tea. After removing these and adding 15 units of milk:
   - Milk: \( 57.5 - 8.625 + 15 = 63.875 \, \text{units} \)
   - Tea: \( 42.5 - 6.375 = 36.125 \, \text{units} \)
   The new concentrations are 63.875% milk and 36.125% tea.

4. **Third Replacement**: John replaces 10% of the solution with milk. The mixture is now 63.875% milk, so 10 units removed contain \( 0.63875 \times 10 = 6.3875 \, \text{units} \) of milk and \( 10 - 6.3875 = 3.6125 \, \text{units} \) of tea. After removing these and adding 10 units of milk:
   - Milk: \( 63.875 - 6.3875 + 10 = 67.4875 \, \text{units} \)
   - Tea: \( 36.125 - 3.6125 = 32.5125 \, \text{units} \)
   The final concentrations are 67.4875% milk and 32.5125% tea.

Thus

---------------

, the final concentration of tea is approximately **32.51%**, which matches option **E**.
