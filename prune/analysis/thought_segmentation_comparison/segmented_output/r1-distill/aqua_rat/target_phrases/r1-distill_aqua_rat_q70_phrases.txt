Okay, so I'm trying to solve this percentage problem. Let me read the question again to make sure I get it right.

So, the shopkeeper gives a 20% discount on all items for one day. Then, the next day, he has to sell them at the original price again. The question is asking by what percentage he must increase the discounted price to get back to the original price. Hmm, I think I remember something about percentage increase and decrease. Let me think about it step by step.

Let me assume the original price of an item is, say, $100. That's a common number to make percentages easy. So, if the original price is $100, a 20% discount would reduce the price. How do I calculate that? Oh right, 20% of 100 is 20, so the discounted price is 100 - 20 = $80. 

Now, the next day, he wants to sell it back at the original price, which is $100. But he's currently selling it at $80. So, he needs to increase the price from $80 to $100. The question is, what's the percentage increase needed here?



---------------

Wait, percentage increase is calculated based on the original value before the increase, right? So the formula is (Increase / Original) * 100%. In this case, the increase is from $80 to $100. So the increase amount is 100 - 80 = $20.

So plugging into the formula: (20 / 80) * 100% = (0.25) * 100% = 25%. So the shopkeeper needs to increase the price by 25% to get back to the original price.



---------------

Wait, let me check if I did that correctly. So, if I take the discounted price of $80 and add 25%, that's 80 + (25% of 80). 25% of 80 is 20, so 80 +20 = 100. Yep, that's correct.

So looking at the options, option C is 25%, which would be the correct answer.

Another way to think about it: when you decrease by a certain percentage and then want to increase back, the percentage needed isn't the same as the decrease. Because the base changes. For example, a 20% decrease takes the base to a lower value, so to get back, you have to calculate based on that lower value.

Let me see another example to confirm. Suppose the original price is $200. 20% discount is $40, so new price is $160. To get back to $200, the increase is 40 over 160. 40/160 is 0.25, so 25%. Yep, same result.

So the answer should be 25%, which is option C.


To solve the problem, let's assume the original price of an item is $100. A 20% discount reduces the price to $80. The shopkeeper wants to return the price to $100 the next day. The increase needed is $20 (from $80 to $100). Percentage increase is calculated as:

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left(\frac{\text{Increase}}{\text{Original Discounted Price}}\right) \times 100\% = \left(\frac{20}{80}\right) \times 100\% = 25\%.
\]

Thus, the shopkeeper must increase the price by 25% to return to the original price. The correct answer is:

Answer: C
