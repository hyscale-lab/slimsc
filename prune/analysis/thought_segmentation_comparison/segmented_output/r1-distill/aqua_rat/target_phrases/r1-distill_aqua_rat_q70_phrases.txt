Okay, so I have this problem here about a shopkeeper who gave a 20% discount for a day and now needs to raise the price back to the original. The question is asking by what percentage he must increase the discounted price to bring it back to the original. Hmm, I remember this is a percentage increase problem. Let me think through it step by step.

First, let me visualize the situation. Suppose the original price of an item is, let's say, $100. That's a common number to make percentages easy. So if the original price is $100, a 20% discount would be 20% of 100, which is $20. So the discounted price becomes $80.

Now, the shopkeeper wants to bring the price back to the original $100 from the discounted $80. The question is, what percentage increase from $80 will get us back to $100?

I remember that percentage increase is calculated by the formula: (Increase / Original) * 100%. Here, the original is the discounted price, which is $80. The increase needed is $20 because 100 minus 80 is 20.

So plugging the numbers in: (20 / 80) * 100% equals what? Let's calculate that. 20 divided by 80 is 0.25. Multiply by 100 gives 25%. 

---------------

Oh wait, so the increase needed is 25% of the discounted price.

Wait, but why can't it be 20% again? Because percentage changes are relative. When you take 20% off, you're taking it off the original 100, but when you're increasing from a lower value, like 80, a 20% increase would be 16, which brings it to 96, not 100. That's why you need a higher percentage to get back to the original price.

Let me check another example to confirm. Suppose the original price is $200. 20% discount is $40, so the price becomes $160. To get back to $200, the increase needed is $40. So, 40 divided by 160 is 0.25, which is 25%. Yep, same result.

So the correct percentage increase needed is 25%. Looking at the options, option C is 25%, so that must be the correct answer.


To determine the percentage increase needed to return the discounted price to the original price, consider the following:

1. Let the original price be \( P \). After a 20% discount, the price becomes \( P \times (1 - 0.20) = 0.80P \).
2. To return to the original price \( P \) from the discounted price \( 0.80P \), the required increase is \( P - 0.80P = 0.20P \).
3. The percentage increase is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase}}{\text{Discounted Price}} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20P}{0.80P} \right) \times 100\% = 25\%.
   \]

Thus, the shopkeeper must increase the discounted price by **25%** to restore it to the original price.
