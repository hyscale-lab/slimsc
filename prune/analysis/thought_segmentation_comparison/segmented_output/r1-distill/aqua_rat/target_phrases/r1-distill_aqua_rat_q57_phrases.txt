Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is about percentages of chocolates in a store, and I need to find what percentage are both vanilla and not squashed. Hmm.

Alright, let's start by breaking down the information given. All chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored. So the total is 100%, right? And 10% of them are cocoa flavored. That means the rest must be vanilla. 

---------------

Wait, because it's either vanilla or cocoa. So 100% minus 10% cocoa is 90% vanilla. So vanilla is 90% of the total chocolates.



---------------

But wait, the next part says 90% of the rest are squashed. Hmm, what's 'the rest' referring to here? Oh, I think 'the rest' must be the vanilla ones because the first part said all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa. So after taking out the 10% cocoa, the remaining 90% are vanilla. So 'the rest' is the 90% vanilla chocolates.

So 90% of these vanilla chocolates are squashed. 

---------------

Wait, that can't be right. Because if 90% of the vanilla are squashed, then 10% of the vanilla are not squashed. Because 100% minus 90% is 10%. So the percentage of vanilla and not squashed would be 10% of the vanilla, which is 90% of the total.



---------------

Wait, let me think again. Let's say the total number of chocolates is 100 to make it easy. 10% are cocoa, so that's 10 chocolates. The rest, which is 90, are vanilla. Now, 90% of these vanilla are squashed. So 90% of 90 is 81. So 81 vanilla chocolates are squashed. That leaves 90 -81=9 vanilla chocolates that are not squashed.

So out of the total 100 chocolates, 9 are vanilla and not squashed. So that's 9% of the total. So the answer should be 9%, which is option D.



---------------

Wait, let me double-check. Total is 100. Cocoa is 10, vanilla is 90. 90% of vanilla are squashed: 0.9 *90=81. So 81 are squashed vanilla. So the vanilla not squashed is 90-81=9. So 9% of the total. Yeah, that makes sense.


To determine the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed, we start by analyzing the given information:

1. **Total chocolates**: Assume there are 100 chocolates for simplicity.
2. **Cocoa-flavored chocolates**: 10% of the total, which is \( 10\% \times 100 = 10 \) chocolates.
3. **Vanilla-flavored chocolates**: Since all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa, the remaining \( 100\% - 10\% = 90\% \) are vanilla, or \( 90 \) chocolates.
4. **Squashed chocolates**: 90% of the vanilla-flavored chocolates are squashed. Thus, \( 90\% \times 90 = 81 \) chocolates are squashed vanilla.
5. **Vanilla-flavored and not squashed chocolates**: Subtract the squashed vanilla chocolates from the total vanilla chocolates: \( 90 - 81 = 9 \) chocolates.

Therefore, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is \( \frac{9}{100} \times 100\% = 9\% \).

Answer: D
