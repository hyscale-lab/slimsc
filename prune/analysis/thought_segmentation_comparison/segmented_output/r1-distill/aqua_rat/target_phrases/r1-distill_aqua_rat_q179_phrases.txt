Okay, so I've got this problem about Ace Book Company's sales revenue. Hmm, let me see. I need to figure out how many times the revenue from novels is compared to that from biographies. Alright, let's break this down.

The question says that last year, 34% of their sales came from novels. 

---------------

Oh wait, right, so the rest, which would be 100% minus 34%, is from other stuff. Let me calculate that. 100 -34 is 66%, so 66% is the remaining revenue. Got it.

Then, of that remaining 66%, a third came from biographies. Oh, so I need to find out what percentage that is. A third of 66%... let's see. 66 divided by 3 is 22. So, 22% of the total revenue is from biographies.



---------------

Wait, so novels are 34% and biographies are 22% of the total revenue. The question is asking how many times the novel revenue is compared to biography. So, I think I need to divide the percentage from novels by the percentage from biographies.

So 34 divided by 22. Let me do that. 34 ÷ 22 is... let's see. 22 times 1 is 22, 22 times 1.5 is 33 (because 22 * 1.5 = 33). 

---------------

Oh wait, 34 is a little more than that. 34 minus 33 is 1, so that's 1/22 left. 1 divided by 22 is approximately 0.045. So adding that to 1.5, it's about 1.545. Hmm, that's approximately 1.5 times.



---------------

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. 22 times 1.5 is 33. So 34 is 1 more than that. So 34 is 1.5 + (1/22) which is roughly 1.545, so around 1.545 times. Looking at the options, option B is 1.5, and option C is 2.1. Hmm, but wait, is there a possibility I made a mistake?



---------------

Wait, another way: maybe I should consider the exact fractions. 34% divided by 22% equals (34/22). Let me compute 34 divided by 22. Well, 22 goes into 34 once, with 12 remaining. So that's 1 and 12/22. 12/22 simplifies to 6/11, which is approximately 0.545. So 1.545 times.

So the approximate number is 1.545, which is about 1.5 times. But the options have 1.5 as option B, and 2.1 as C. 

---------------

Wait, but wait, maybe I should think in terms of the actual ratio of their revenues, not just percentages. 

---------------

Oh wait, because the percentages are of the same total revenue, so the ratio would be the same as the ratio of their percentages. So 34% to 22% is the same as 34:22, which simplifies to 17:11. Let me compute 17 divided by 11. 11*1=11, 11*1.5=16.5. 17 is 0.5 more than 16.5, so 0.5/11 is about 0.045, so 1.545 again. So same result.

So the answer is approximately 1.5 times, which is option B. 

---------------

But wait, the options given are A)1.3, B)1.5, C)2.1, D)2.5, E)3.1. So B is 1.5, which is the closest to 1.545. So the answer should be B.



---------------

Wait, but wait another thought. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me try again.

Total revenue is 100 units for simplicity. So novels contribute 34 units. The remaining is 66 units. Of that 66, a third is from biographies. So 66 * (1/3) is 22 units. So biographies are 22 units. So the ratio is 34 / 22 = 1.545, which is about 1.5 times. So yeah, B is correct.



---------------

Alternatively, maybe the question is worded differently. The problem says 'how many times its revenue from the sale of novels was approximately...'. 

---------------

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question is: "The company's revenue from the sale of novels was approximately, how many times its revenue from the sale of biographies?"



---------------

Oh wait, no, I think I got it right. Because it's (novel revenue)/(biography revenue) = 34/22 ≈1.545. So the answer is approximately 1.5 times, which is option B.



---------------

But wait, let me think again. Did I misinterpret the question? The first part says 34% from novels. The rest, 66%, 1/3 is biographies. So 66% is the total of the rest, which includes biographies and perhaps other categories. So the 1/3 is of the remaining 66%, so that's 22% for biographies.

So the ratio is 34 to 22, which is 1.545 times. So the closest option is B)1.5.


To determine how many times the revenue from novels is compared to the revenue from biographies, we start by analyzing the given data:

1. **Novel Revenue**: 34% of the total revenue comes from novels.
2. **Remaining Revenue**: The remaining revenue is 100% - 34% = 66%.
3. **Biography Revenue**: Of this remaining 66%, one-third comes from biographies. Thus, the revenue from biographies is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 66\% = 22\% \text{ of the total revenue.}
   \]

Next, we calculate the ratio of the revenue from novels to the revenue from biographies:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Novel Revenue}}{\text{Biography Revenue}} = \frac{34\%}{22\%} = \frac{34}{22} \approx 1.545.
\]

This value is approximately 1.5 times. Among the given options, the closest value is **1.5**, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
