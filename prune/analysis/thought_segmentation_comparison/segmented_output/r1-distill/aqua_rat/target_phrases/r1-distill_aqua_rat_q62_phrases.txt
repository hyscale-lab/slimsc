Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the maximum distance I can travel with $8.50 in a cab. The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and then 10 cents for each additional quarter mile. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

Let me start by understanding the problem. The total money I have is $8.50. The initial charge is $3.50 for the first quarter-mile. After that, each extra quarter-mile costs $0.10. I need to find how many quarter-miles I can go beyond the first one with the remaining money, then add that to the initial quarter-mile to get the total distance.

Wait, right. So the first thing is to subtract the initial charge from the total amount. So $8.50 minus $3.50. Let me calculate that. 8.50 - 3.50 is 5.00. So I have $5.00 left for the additional distance.

Each additional quarter-mile is 10 cents, which is $0.10. I need to find how many times $0.10 fits into $5.00. That's like dividing 5 by 0.10. 5 / 0.10 equals 50. So that's 50 additional quarter-miles.

Wait, but each of those is a quarter mile, right. So each one adds 0.25 miles. So the total additional distance would be 50 * 0.25 miles. Let's compute that. 50 times 0.25 is 12.5 miles. 

Now, adding the initial quarter-mile. The first part is 0.25 miles, so total distance is 0.25 + 12.5 = 12.75 miles. So the maximum distance is 12.75 miles.

Looking at the options, option B is 12.75 miles. So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Initial cost is $3.50, leaving $5.00. Each quarter-mile after that is 10 cents, so 5 / 0.10 = 50. So 50 quarter-miles. Each is 0.25, so 50 * 0.25 is 12.5. Plus the initial 0.25 makes 12.75. Yeah, that seems right.

So the answer is B)12.75 miles.


To calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 in a cab, start by subtracting the initial charge of $3.50 for the first quarter-mile from the total amount. This leaves $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00 for additional distance. Each additional quarter-mile costs $0.10, so the number of additional quarter-miles is $5.00 / $0.10 = 50. Each quarter-mile is 0.25 miles, so the additional distance is 50 * 0.25 = 12.5 miles. Adding the initial quarter-mile (0.25 miles) gives a total distance of 0.25 + 12.5 = 12.75 miles. 

Thus, the maximum distance you can travel is **12.75 miles**, which corresponds to option **B**.
