Okay, so I've got this problem here about a room's height and semi-perimeter. Hmm, let me try to unpack it step by step. The question says the height to semi-perimeter ratio is 2:5. So, height divided by semi-perimeter equals 2/5. That gives me an equation: H / S = 2/5, so H = (2/5)*S, where H is the height and S is the semi-perimeter.



---------------

Wait, wait, semi-perimeter is half the perimeter, right? So S = (2*(length + width))/2 = length + width. Oh right, because the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(l + w), so semi-perimeter is l + w.

So, H = (2/5)*(l + w). Got that down.

Next part: It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls. The paper is 50 cm wide, costs Rs.2 per meter. And they allow 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So I need to find the area of the walls and subtract the doors and windows, then relate that to the cost.



---------------

Wait, let's break it down. The cost is based on the area of the paper used. So the cost per meter is Rs.2, but the paper is 50 cm wide. So each strip of paper is 50 cm wide and let's see, the length is what? Well, the cost per meter is Rs.2, but each strip is 50 cm, which is 0.5 meters. So for each 0.5m strip, the cost is 0.5m * Rs.2/m = Rs.1 per strip. Or maybe I should think in terms of the area of the paper used.



---------------

Wait, maybe it's better to calculate the total area of the paper used. The cost is Rs.260, and the paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters. The cost per meter is Rs.2, but I'm not sure if that's the cost per meter of length or per square meter. 

---------------

Wait, probably per meter of the roll. Because paper is sold by the linear meter. So for each linear meter of the paper (which is 0.5m wide), the cost is Rs.2.

So, the cost per square meter of paper would be 2 Rs per linear meter divided by 0.5m width, which is 4 Rs per square meter? Because each linear meter gives 0.5m² of area (since 0.5m wide * 1m length = 0.5 m²). So 0.5 m² costs Rs.2, so 1 m² costs 4 Rs. Hmm, but wait, the problem says the cost is Rs.260, so maybe I should calculate how much area of paper was used.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the cost is calculated as the area multiplied by the price per area. Let me think. The paper's width is 50 cm, which is 0.5m. So for each meter length of the paper, the area is 0.5 m². The price per meter is Rs.2, so for each 0.5 m², it's Rs.2. So the price per square meter is Rs.2 / 0.5 = Rs.4 per m².

So, the cost is Rs.260, which is equal to the area of the paper used multiplied by Rs.4 per m². So the area of the paper used is 260 / 4 = 65 m².



---------------

But wait, the problem says allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So the actual area to be covered is the total wall area minus 15 m². Because the paper is used to cover the walls, but they subtract the area of doors and windows.

So the area of the walls (excluding doors and windows) is 65 m². Because 65 m² is the paper area used, but that's after subtracting the 15 m².



---------------

Wait, no. Wait, the total area that the paper covers is 65 m², but that includes the doors and windows? Or is the 15 m² subtracted first?



---------------

Wait, the wording says "allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows." So perhaps the total area that needs to be covered by the paper is (wall area) minus 15 m², and that's the area that the paper covers. So the paper area is (wall area - 15) = 65 m². So the wall area is 65 + 15 = 80 m².



---------------

Wait, no. Let me think again. The cost is for papering the walls, allowing for 15 m². So the total area of the paper used is the wall area minus the 15 m². So paper area = wall area - 15.

So wall area = paper area + 15.



---------------

Wait, but paper area is 65 m², so wall area = 65 +15 = 80 m². Yes, that makes sense.

So the area of the walls is 80 m².



---------------

Wait, but wait, how is the area of the walls calculated? For a room, the walls are four walls. Two with dimensions (length × height) and two with (width × height). So the total area is 2*(l + w)*h. So 2h(l + w) = 80 m².

But earlier, we have H = (2/5)*(l +w). So l + w = (5/2)*H.

Substituting that into the wall area equation:

2 * H * (l + w) = 80 → 2H*(5H/2) )=80 → 2H*(5H/2) = 5H² =80 → H²=16 → H=4 m.



---------------

Wait, that seems straightforward. So the height is 4 meters. Looking at the options, option C is 4m.



---------------

Wait, but wait a second. Let me go through the steps again to make sure I didn't skip anything.

1. H/S = 2/5 → S=5H/2. S is semi-perimeter, which is l + w. So l +w =5H/2.

2. Cost is 260 Rs. Paper is 50 cm wide (0.5m), cost per meter is Rs2.

So, the area of the paper used is 65 m² (260 /4 =65). Because each meter of paper is 0.5m² (since 0.5m wide × 1m long), and each costs Rs2. So 2 Rs per 0.5 m² → 4 Rs/m².

So, paper area is 65 m².

But the paper is used to cover the walls, but doors and windows take up 15 m². So the actual wall area is 65 +15 =80 m².

The wall area is 2*(l + w)*h = 2*(l +w)*h.

We have l +w =5H/2. So substituting:

2*(5H/2)*h =5H *h =80 →5H²=80 → H²=16 → H=4m.

So the height is 4 meters, which is option C.



---------------

Wait, but let me think about the paper area again. Because the paper is 0.5m wide, and you have to cover the walls. The area of the walls is 80 m², and the paper has an area of 65 m². But that doesn't make sense because 65 <80. Hmm, wait, maybe I have it reversed. Because the paper area is 65, which is the area minus the doors and windows. So perhaps the actual wall area is 65 +15=80.



---------------

Wait, that's correct. So paper area = wall area - doors and windows → 65 = WA -15 → WA=80.

Yes, that makes sense. So the wall area is 80, and paper is 65 because 15 is subtracted.

So the calculation holds, and H is 4 meters. So the correct answer is C.


The problem involves determining the height of a room given the ratio of height to semi-perimeter (2:5) and the cost of papering the walls. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Height and Semi-perimeter Relationship**:  
   The ratio of height to semi-perimeter is given as \( \frac{H}{S} = \frac{2}{5} \), where \( H \) is the height and \( S \) is the semi-perimeter. Since \( S = l + w \) (where \( l \) and \( w \) are the length and width of the room), we have:  
   \[
   H = \frac{2}{5}(l + w)
   \]

2. **Wall Area Calculation**:  
   The cost of papering the walls is Rs. 260, with paper that is 50 cm wide (0.5 m) and costs Rs. 2 per meter. The area of the paper used is:  
   \[
   \text{Area of paper} = \frac{\text{Cost}}{\text{Price per square meter}} = \frac{260}{4} = 65 \, \text{m}^2
   \]  
   The problem states that 15 \( \text{m}^2 \) is allowed for doors and windows. Therefore, the total wall area (excluding doors and windows) is:  
   \[
   \text{Wall area} = \text{Paper area} + \text{Area for doors and windows} = 65 + 15 = 80 \, \text{m}^2
   \]

3. **Relating Wall Area to Height**:  
   The area of the walls is given by:  
   \[
   \text{Wall area} = 2 \times (l + w) \times H
   \]  
   Substituting \( l + w = \frac{5H}{2} \) (from the height-to-semi-perimeter ratio):  
   \[
   2 \times \frac{5H}{2} \times H = 80
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   5H^2 = 80 \implies H^2 = 16 \implies H = 4 \, \text{m}
   \]

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The height of the room is \( 4 \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to option C.
