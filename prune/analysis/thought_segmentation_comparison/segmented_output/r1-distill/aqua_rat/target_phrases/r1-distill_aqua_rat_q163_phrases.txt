Okay, so I have this problem here about making identical bouquets with white and red tulips. Let me see. The question is asking for the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made from 28 white and 98 red tulips without leaving any flowers out. Hmm, I think this is a problem about finding the greatest common divisor, or GCD, because I remember that when you want to split things into equal groups without leftovers, the GCD is the key.

Wait, but let me think again. So, the bouquets need to have the same number of white and red tulips each. So each bouquet will have, say, 'w' white tulips and 'r' red ones. Then, the total number of bouquets will be such that 28 is divided by 'w' and 98 is divided by 'r'. But since the bouquets are identical, 'w' and 'r' must be the same for each bouquet.



---------------

But wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Because the total number of bouquets will be the same whether I look at white or red. So, the number of bouquets must be a divisor of both 28 and 98. Oh right, because if I can make 'n' bouquets, each with 'a' white tulips and 'b' red ones, then n*a =28 and n*b=98. So n must divide both 28 and 98, meaning n is the greatest common divisor of 28 and 98.

So I need to find the GCD of 28 and 98. Let me calculate that.

First, let's find the prime factors of each number. 

28: I know that 28 divided by 2 is 14, then 14 divided by 2 is 7, which is a prime. So 28 is 2^2 * 7^1.

98: Let's see, 98 divided by 2 is 49. 49 is 7 squared. So 98 is 2^1 * 7^2.

Now, the GCD is the product of the smallest power of each common prime factor. So for 2, the smaller exponent is 1 (from 98). For 7, the smaller exponent is 1 (from 28). So GCD is 2^1 *7^1 = 14.



---------------

Wait, wait. So the GCD is 14. That would mean the maximum number of bouquets is 14. Let me check the options. Option D is 14.



---------------

But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Because each bouquet would then have 28/14=2 white tulips and 98/14=7 red ones. That's 2 white and 7 red per bouquet. That seems correct because 2*14=28 and 7*14=98. So all flowers are used up without leftovers.



---------------

Wait, but another approach: Maybe the number of bouquets is the maximum number that divides both the white and red counts. So yes, GCD of 28 and 98 is 14. So the answer should be D)14.


To determine the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made from 28 white and 98 red tulips without leaving any flowers out, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 28 and 98. This is because the number of bouquets must divide both the total number of white and red tulips evenly.

First, we factorize the numbers:
- \( 28 = 2^2 \times 7^1 \)
- \( 98 = 2^1 \times 7^2 \)

The GCD is the product of the smallest powers of the common prime factors:
- For \( 2 \), the smallest power is \( 2^1 \).
- For \( 7 \), the smallest power is \( 7^1 \).

Thus, the GCD is:
\[
\text{GCD} = 2^1 \times 7^1 = 14
\]

This means the maximum number of identical bouquets is 14. Each bouquet would contain:
\[
\frac{28}{14} = 2 \text{ white tulips and } \frac{98}{14} = 7 \text{ red tulips.}
\]
All flowers are used without leftovers, confirming that the greatest number of identical bouquets is indeed 14.
