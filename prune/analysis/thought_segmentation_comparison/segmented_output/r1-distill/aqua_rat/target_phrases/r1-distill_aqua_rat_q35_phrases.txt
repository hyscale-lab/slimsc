Okay, so I've got this problem here about someone named A who's traveling in different directions and I need to figure out how far they are from home in the end. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the directions given are: A starts by traveling 3 km south, then 5 km east, then another 3 km north, and finally 2 km west. Hmm, I should probably draw a diagram to visualize this better. Maybe using a coordinate system would help.

Let's imagine A starts at the origin point (0,0). So when A goes south, that's in the negative y-direction. 

---------------

Wait, wait, actually, in standard coordinates, south would be negative y, east is positive x, north is positive y, and west is negative x. Or is it the other way around? 

---------------

Wait, no, I think in the usual coordinate system, positive y is north and positive x is east. So moving south would decrease the y-coordinate, east increases x, north increases y, and west decreases x.



---------------

Wait, but sometimes in some diagrams, it's the opposite. Like, north is up (positive y), south is down (negative y), east is right (positive x), west is left (negative x). So I think that's correct.

So starting at (0,0). First, A goes 3 km south. So from (0,0), moving south 3 km would take A to (0, -3). Because south is negative y.

Next, A travels 5 km east. East is positive x direction. So from (0,-3), adding 5 km east would take them to (5, -3).

Then, A goes 3 km north. North is positive y. So from (5,-3), adding 3 km north would change the y-coordinate from -3 to 0. So now they're at (5,0).

Finally, A travels 2 km west. West is negative x. So from (5,0), subtracting 2 km in x brings them to (5-2, 0) which is (3,0).



---------------

Wait, so starting at (0,0), after all the movements, they end up at (3,0). So how far are they from home, which is (0,0)? Well, the distance between (3,0) and (0,0) is 3 km. Because it's along the x-axis.



---------------

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check. So starting point is (0,0). After moving south 3 km: (0,-3). Then east 5 km: (5,-3). North 3 km: (5,0). West 2 km: (3,0). So yes, that's correct. So the distance is the straight line from (3,0) to (0,0), which is 3 km. So the answer should be option A) 3 km.



---------------

Wait, but wait another thought. Did I get the directions right? Because sometimes in these problems, especially when dealing with east and west after moving north and south, it's easy to get confused. Let me think again.



---------------

Wait, starting at origin. South 3: (0,-3). East 5: (5,-3). North 3: y increases by 3, so from -3 to 0, so (5,0). Then west 2: x decreases by 2, so 5-2=3. So (3,0). So the displacement is 3 km east from home. So the distance is 3 km. So option A is correct.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Another way to think is net movement in each direction.

Net south movement: 3 km south, then 3 km north. So those cancel out. So net movement in y-direction is zero.

In the x-direction: 5 km east, then 2 km west. So net east movement is 5-2=3 km east.

So the person is 3 km east of the starting point, so the distance from home is 3 km. So answer A.


A starts at the origin point \((0,0)\). The movements are as follows:

1. **3 km south**: South decreases the \(y\)-coordinate. Starting from \((0,0)\), moving 3 km south brings A to \((0, -3)\).
2. **5 km east**: East increases the \(x\)-coordinate. From \((0, -3)\), moving 5 km east brings A to \((5, -3)\).
3. **3 km north**: North increases the \(y\)-coordinate. From \((5, -3)\), moving 3 km north brings A to \((5, 0)\).
4. **2 km west**: West decreases the \(x\)-coordinate. From \((5, 0)\), moving 2 km west brings A to \((3, 0)\).

The final position is \((3, 0)\), which is 3 km east of the starting point \((0,0)\). The straight-line distance from home is therefore **3 km**.

Answer: A
