Okay, so I've got this problem here about someone named A who is traveling in different directions and I need to figure out how far they are from home after all that. Hmm, let me try to visualize this step by step.

Alright, so the directions are: first, A travels 3 km south. Then 5 km east, then another 3 km north, and finally 2 km west. I think I should draw this out on a piece of paper to make it clearer.

Let me imagine a coordinate system where A starts at the origin point (0,0). South would be the negative y-direction, east the positive x, north the positive y, and west the negative x.

First movement: 3 km south. So from (0,0), moving south 3 km would take A to (0, -3). That makes sense because south decreases the y-coordinate.

Next, 5 km east. So from (0,-3), moving east (positive x) by 5 km brings A to (5, -3). 

---------------

Wait, no, wait, because the starting point after south is (0,-3), right? So adding 5 to x: (5, -3).

Then, 3 km north. North increases the y-coordinate. So from (5,-3), moving north 3 km would add 3 to the y. So y becomes (-3 +3) = 0. So now, A is at (5, 0). Oh, that's interesting. So after moving south 3 and then north 3, the net movement in the north-south direction is zero. So the starting point's y-coordinate is back to zero. But the x-coordinate is at 5.

Finally, A moves 2 km west. West is negative x, so from (5,0), subtracting 2 gives (5-2, 0) = (3,0). So now, A is at (3,0).



---------------

Wait, so the final position is 3 km east of home. Because the origin is (0,0), and the final is (3,0). So the distance from home is the straight line distance, which is just 3 km in the east direction. So the distance is 3 km. 

---------------

But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, another way to look at it: net movement in each direction.

South 3, then north 3: those cancel out. So net movement in y is 0. In the x-direction: east 5, west 2. So net east movement is 5-2=3 km. So yes, 3 km east of home. So the distance is 3 km. So the answer should be option A, which is 3 km.



---------------

But wait, another thought: sometimes these problems can have tricky parts, like if the east and west movements are on different latitudes, but I think in this case, since the north-south movements cancel, the east-west movements are straightforward.

So yeah, the answer should be 3 km. So option A.


To determine how far A is from home after the journey, we analyze the movements step by step:

1. **Starting Point**: A begins at the origin, (0, 0).
2. **First Movement**: A travels 3 km south. This brings A to the point (0, -3).
3. **Second Movement**: A travels 5 km east. This moves A to the point (5, -3).
4. **Third Movement**: A travels 3 km north. This brings A to the point (5, 0), as the northward movement cancels the earlier southward movement.
5. **Fourth Movement**: A travels 2 km west. This moves A to the point (3, 0).

The final position of A is (3, 0), which is 3 km east of the starting point. The straight-line distance from home is therefore **3 km**.

**Answer: A**
