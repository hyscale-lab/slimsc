Okay, so I've got this math problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question says that Q is a positive integer with 5 factors, and I have to figure out which of the statements I, II, or III must be true about Q. The options are given as A to E, each combining these statements in different ways.

Hmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has relates to its prime factorization. Oh right, if a number is expressed as a product of primes raised to exponents, like p^a * q^b, then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc. So for example, if a number is p^4, the number of factors is 4+1=5, right?



---------------

Wait, the question says Q has 5 factors. Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to write it as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5=5*1. That means that the exponents plus one multiply to 5. So that would mean that Q must be of the form p^4, because (4+1)=5. Or wait, could there be another possibility? Let me think.



---------------

Wait, another thought: 5 is a prime, so the only way for (a+1)(b+1)... to be 5 is if one of the exponents is 4 and the rest are zero. Because if there are more than one prime factors, then each (exponent +1) would be at least 2, but 2*2=4 which is less than 5. So that's not possible. So Q must be the fourth power of a prime number. Because if it had two primes, say p^a * q^b, then (a+1)(b+1)=5. Since 5 is prime, one of them must be 5 and the other 1. So one exponent is 4, the other is 0. But a prime exponent of 0 would mean that prime isn't present. So that brings us back to just one prime factor. So Q is p^4.



---------------

Wait, but wait a second. What about p squared? Because p squared has (2+1)=3 factors. So that's 1, p, p². So 3 factors. But in this case, we have 5 factors. So it's p^4. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. 

---------------

Wait, p squared is p², which would have 3 factors. But p^4 would be (p²)^2. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime, but if Q is p^4, then it's the square of p², which is a square. 

---------------

But wait, is p² a prime? No, because p is a prime, so p² is composite. So statement I would be false because Q is p^4, which is (p²)^2, but p² is not a prime. Oh, wait, no. Let me clarify. Statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So if Q is p^4, is it the square of a prime? Because p^4 is (p²)^2, but p² is not a prime. So Q is not the square of a prime, it's the square of a composite number. So statement I would be false.



---------------

Wait, no, that's a mistake. Let me think again. Q is p^4. Let's take an example, like p=2. Then p^4=16. So 16 is 2^4, which is (2²)^2. So is 16 the square of a prime? 2² is 4, which is not prime. So 16 is the square of 4, which is composite. So statement I would be incorrect. So statement I is false.



---------------

Wait, but statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. Well, in the case of Q=16, that's exactly 2^4. So statement II is true. So I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me retrace. Oh, I think I confused myself earlier. Let's clarify:

If a number has exactly 5 factors, it must be the fourth power of a prime. Because 5 is a prime number, so the only way to write 5 as a product of (exponents +1) is 5=5*1, meaning one exponent is 4 and others are 0, which means only one prime factor. So statement II is correct.



---------------

Wait, but earlier I thought statement I was correct. So I must have gotten confused. Let me take another example. Let's take p=3. Then p^4=81. The factors of 81 are 1, 3, 9, 27, 81. That's 5 factors. So Q is 3^4. So statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. So that's true. Statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Well, 3^4 is (3^2)^2, which is 9^2. But 9 isn't a prime, it's 3 squared. So statement I is not true because Q is not the square of a prime, but the square of a composite number (9). So statement I is false.



---------------

Wait, that's conflicting with my initial thought. So if statement II is correct, but statement I is incorrect, then looking at the options, the correct answer would be option C, which is II only. Because the options are:

A) I only
B) III only
C) II only
D) I and II only
E) I and III only



---------------

But wait, let me check the statements again. Statement I: Q is the square of a prime. No, because it's p^4, which is (p^2)^2. So the square is of a composite (p^2). So I is false.

Statement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime. Yes, that's correct.

Statement III: Q is the product of two primes. So if Q is p^4, is it the product of two primes? No, because it's p*p*p*p, which is p^4, not a product of two different primes. So statement III is false.

So only statement II is correct. So the correct option is C.



---------------

Wait, but let me make sure. Let's think of another example. If Q is 16 (2^4), it's factors are 1,2,4,8,16. That's 5 factors. So Q is the fourth power of 2, which is a prime. So II is correct. It's not the product of two primes, because that would be like 2*3=6, which has (1+1)(1+1)=4 factors. So 6 has four factors. So statement III is incorrect.

So the correct answer is C: II only.


To determine which statements about \( Q \) must be true, we analyze the given information: \( Q \) is a positive integer with exactly 5 factors. The number of factors of a positive integer is determined by its prime factorization. If \( Q \) has the prime factorization \( p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \dots p_n^{a_n} \), the total number of factors is \( (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \dots (a_n + 1) \).

Since \( Q \) has exactly 5 factors, and 5 is a prime number, the only way to express 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is \( 5 = 5 \times 1 \). This implies that \( Q \) must be of the form \( p^4 \), where \( p \) is a prime number. This is because \( (4 + 1) = 5 \), and any additional prime factors would result in more than one term in the product, which is not possible given the constraint of 5 factors.

### Analysis of the Statements:
1. **Statement I: \( Q \) is the square of a prime number.**  
   If \( Q = p^4 \), it can be written as \( (p^2)^2 \). However, \( p^2 \) is not a prime number; it is a composite number. Therefore, \( Q \) is not the square of a prime number, making this statement **false**.

2. **Statement II: \( Q \) is the fourth power of a prime number.**  
   Since \( Q = p^4 \), where \( p \) is a prime number, this statement is **true**.

3. **Statement III: \( Q \) is the product of two prime numbers.**  
   If \( Q = p^4 \), it is not the product of two distinct primes. Instead, it is the fourth power of a single prime number. Therefore, this statement is **false**.

### Conclusion:
Only Statement II is true. Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
