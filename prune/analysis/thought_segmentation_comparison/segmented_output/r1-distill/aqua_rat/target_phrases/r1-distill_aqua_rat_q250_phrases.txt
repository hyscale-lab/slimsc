Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again. The population of a city is 5,265,526. There are 4,169,516 adults. I need to find out how many children there are. Hmm, sounds straightforward, but I want to make sure I do this right.



---------------

Wait, so the total population is the sum of adults and children, right? Because everyone is either an adult or a child. So if I subtract the number of adults from the total population, I should get the number of children. That makes sense.

Let me write down the numbers to make it clearer. Total population is 5,265,526. Adults are 4,169,516. So I subtract the adults from the total. So 5,265,526 minus 4,169,516 equals... Hmm, let's do the subtraction step by step.



---------------

Wait, maybe I should line them up properly to avoid mistakes. Let's see:

5,265,526
-4,169,516
= ?

Let me subtract each place:

Starting from the units place:
6 - 6 = 0.
2 -1 =1.
5-5=0.
6-9... 

---------------

Oh wait, wait. Wait, 6 is less than 9, so I need to borrow. Let me think, so the next digit is 5 (in the thousands place). I'll borrow one from the 5, which becomes 4. So the 6 becomes 16. Then 16-9=7.

Moving to the next digit: 5 (now it's 4 after borrowing) minus 6. Oh, 4 is less than 6, so I need to borrow again. The next digit is 2 (ten thousands place). So I'll borrow one, making it 1, and the 4 becomes 14. 14-6=8.

Next digit: 1 (since I borrowed earlier, it's now 1) minus 1 (from the thousands place in the second number, which is 4,169,516). 

---------------

Wait, wait, wait. Let me make sure I'm aligning the digits correctly. Maybe it's easier to write it down.



---------------

Wait, maybe I should compute it numerically. Let me try a different approach. 5,265,526 minus 4,169,516. Let's subtract 4 million from 5 million, which leaves 1 million. Then 169,516 from 265,526. 

---------------

Wait, no, perhaps I should compute it as:

5,265,526
-4,169,516
= ?



---------------

Alternatively, I can think of it as adding up. Let me see: 4,169,516 plus what equals 5,265,526?



---------------

Wait, maybe I can break it down. The difference between 4 million and 5 million is 1 million. Then, 169,516 and 265,526. Let me compute 265,526 minus 169,516.

265,526 - 169,516 = ?

Let's subtract:

265,526
-169,516
= ?

Again, let's subtract each digit:

6-6=0.
2-1=1.
5-5=0.
5-9? Hmm, can't do that. So I'll need to borrow. The 5 becomes 15, and the next digit (6) becomes 5. 15-9=6.

Next digit: 5 (after borrowing, it's 5) minus 6. Again, 5 is less than 6. So I borrow from the next digit. The next digit is 2, so it becomes 1, and the 5 becomes 15. 15-6=9.

Next digit: 1 (since we borrowed) minus 1. 1-1=0.

So putting it together, 96,010? 

---------------

Wait, let me check again.

Wait, maybe I should do it step by step.

Wait, 265,526 minus 169,516.

Let me compute 265,526 - 169,516.

Breaking it down:

Take 169,516 away from 265,526.

265,526 minus 169,516.

Let me compute 265,526 - 100,000 = 165,526.

165,526 - 69,516 = ?

69,516 is 60,000 + 9,516.

165,526 - 60,000 = 105,526.

105,526 - 9,516 = 96,010.

So the difference is 96,010.



---------------

Wait, but wait, that's for the 265,526 minus 169,516 part.

So the total difference would be 1,000,000 + 96,010 = 1,096,010.



---------------

Wait, but wait, the initial subtraction is 5,265,526 minus 4,169,516. So that's 1,000,000 plus (265,526 - 169,516) which is 96,010. So total is 1,096,010.



---------------

Wait, but let me check again with another approach. Let's add 4,169,516 to 1,096,010 and see if we get 5,265,526.

4,169,516 + 1,096,010 = ?

4,169,516 + 1,000,000 =5,169,516.

Then add 96,010: 5,169,516 +96,010 =5,265,526. Yes, that's correct.

So the number of children is 1,096,010.

Looking at the options, option E is 1,096,061. Hmm, but my calculation gives 1,096,010. 

---------------

Wait, did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait, let me recheck the subtraction.

Wait, 5,265,526 minus 4,169,516.



---------------

Another approach: Let's subtract digit by digit.

5,265,526
-4,169,516
= ?

Starting from the right (units place):

6 -6 =0.

Next digit: 2-1=1.

Next:5-5=0.

Next:6-9. Can't do that, so borrow. The 6 becomes 16, and the next digit (5) becomes 4.

So 16-9=7.

Next digit: 4 (since we borrowed) minus 6. Can't do that. So borrow from the next digit.

The next digit is 2 (which is the million place?), wait, no. 

---------------

Wait, the digits are:

5,265,526 is:

Millions: 5

Hundred thousands:2

Ten thousands:6

Thousands:5

Hundreds:5

Tens:2

Units:6.



---------------

Wait, no, wait. Let me write it out properly.

Wait, 5,265,526 is 5 million 2 hundred 65 thousand 526. 

---------------

Wait, maybe that's not the right way. Let me list the digits with their places.

Position: millions, hundred thousands, ten thousands, thousands, hundreds, tens, units.

Digits: 5, 2, 6, 5, 5, 2, 6.

So when subtracting, the thousands place is 5 (the 4th digit from the right), and the digit before that is 6 (ten thousands place).



---------------

Wait, so the thousands digit is 5. So when subtracting, let's go step by step.

Units: 6-6=0.

Tens:2-1=1.

Hundreds:5-5=0.

Thousands:5-9. Can't do that, so borrow from the ten thousands place.

Ten thousands place is 6, so we borrow 1, making it 5, and the thousands digit becomes 15.

15-9=6.

Now, ten thousands place is now 5 (after borrowing). So 5 minus 6? 

---------------

Wait, the number being subtracted has 6 in the ten thousands place. Wait, the original number is 4,169,516. Let's see:

4,169,516:

Millions:4

Hundred thousands:1

Ten thousands:6

Thousands:9

Hundreds:5

Tens:1

Units:6.



---------------

Wait, so in the ten thousands place, the number to subtract is 6. So after borrowing, the ten thousands digit in the top number is 5 (since we borrowed 1 for the thousands place). So 5 (top) minus 6 (bottom) is not possible, so we need to borrow again.

So we go to the hundred thousands place. The top digit is 2 (hundred thousands place in 5,265,526). We borrow 1, making it 1, and the ten thousands digit becomes 15.

Now, 15 (ten thousands) minus 6 (ten thousands) is 9.

Next digit: hundred thousands place: top was 2, became 1 after borrowing. Subtract 1 (from the bottom number, which is 4,169,516's hundred thousands digit is 1). So 1 -1 =0.

Next, millions place: top is 5, bottom is 4. 5-4=1.

So putting it all together, the digits are:

Millions:1

Hundred thousands:0

Ten thousands:9

Thousands:6

Hundreds:0

Tens:1

Units:0.



---------------

Wait, that's 1,096,010. Oh, right, that's the same as before.

So the number of children is 1,096,010. Now, looking at the options, option E is 1,096,061. Hmm, but that's not matching. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A)1,095,961

B)1,065,961

C)1,085,961

D)1,097,961

E)1,096,061



---------------

Wait, none of these options is 1,096,010. Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation?



---------------

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the subtraction. Let me try another approach. Let me compute 5,265,526 minus 4,169,516.



---------------

Another way: 5,265,526 - 4,169,516 = ?

Let me compute this using another method.

Let me subtract each part:

5,265,526 = 5,000,000 + 265,526

4,169,516 = 4,000,000 + 169,516

So, subtracting: (5,000,000 -4,000,000) = 1,000,000

And (265,526 -169,516) = ?

Compute 265,526 -169,516:

265,526
-169,516
= ?

Let me compute 265,526 minus 169,516:

265,526 - 169,516.

Let me subtract 169,516 from 265,526.



---------------

Another way: 169,516 + X = 265,526.

So X = 265,526 -169,516.

Compute 265,526 -169,516.

265,526 minus 100,000 is 165,526.

165,526 minus 69,516.

Compute 165,526 - 69,516.

Let me subtract 60,000 from 165,526: 105,526.

Then subtract 9,516 from 105,526.

105,526 - 9,516 = 96,010.

So 265,526 -169,516 =96,010.

So adding to the 1,000,000 gives 1,096,010.

So the correct number is 1,096,010.

Looking at the options, none of the options exactly match this. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A)1,095,961

B)1,065,961

C)1,085,961

D)1,097,961

E)1,096,061

Hmm, none of these is 1,096,010. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me try to compute it again.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Let me try using another approach, maybe adding the difference to 4,169,516 to see if it equals 5,265,526.

Let's see, 4,169,516 + 1,096,010 = ?

Compute 4,169,516 + 1,000,000 =5,169,516.

Then add 96,010: 5,169,516 +96,010 =5,265,526. Yes, that adds up correctly. So the correct number is 1,096,010.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the subtraction. Let me check the numbers again.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I read the numbers wrong. Let me recheck the initial numbers.

The total population is 5,265,526.

Number of adults is 4,169,516.

So 5,265,526 minus 4,169,516.

Let me compute it digit by digit again:

5,265,526
-4,169,516
------------
= ?

Starting from the right:

6 -6 =0.

2 -1=1.

5-5=0.

6-9: can't do, so borrow. 6 becomes 16, 5 becomes 4. 16-9=7.

Next digit: 4 (after borrowing) -6: can't do. So borrow. 6 becomes 16, the 2 becomes 1. 16-6=10. 

---------------

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the 4 is in the thousands place, and the next digit is 6 in the ten thousands place. So when I borrow from the 6 (ten thousands), the 4 becomes 14.

So 14 -6=8.

Next digit: 6 (now it's 5 because we borrowed) -1=4.



---------------

Wait, wait, the top number after borrowing is 5 (since 6 became 5) in the ten thousands place. The bottom number's ten thousands digit is 1 (from 4,169,516: 1 in the hundred thousands, 6 in the ten thousands, 9 in thousands, etc.)



---------------

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe a better approach is to write it all out.

Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator approach, but since I can't, let me do it step by step.

5,265,526

-4,169,516

Let me subtract each digit:

Units:6-6=0.

Tens:2-1=1.

Hundreds:5-5=0.

Thousands:5-9: Can't do. So borrow from ten thousands.

Ten thousands digit is 6, so it becomes 5, and the thousands digit becomes 15. 15-9=6.

Ten thousands place:5 (after borrow) -6. Can't do. So borrow from hundred thousands.

Hundred thousands digit is 2, becomes 1. Ten thousands becomes 15. 15-6=9.

Hundred thousands place:1 (after borrow) -1 (from 4,169,516's hundred thousands digit 1). 1-1=0.

Millions place:5-4=1.

So the result is 1,096,010.

So the correct answer is 1,096,010, which isn't listed in the options. 

---------------

Wait, looking at the options again:

E is 1,096,061. Hmm, that's 51 more than my result. Did I make a mistake in the borrowing?



---------------

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the subtraction. Let me try a different approach.

Wait, maybe I should write the numbers vertically and subtract.

5,265,526

-4,169,516

Let me align them:

5,265,526

-4,169,516

=?

Let me subtract each digit:

Starting from the right:

6-6=0.

2-1=1.

5-5=0.

5 (thousands place) -9: Can't do, borrow from ten thousands.

Ten thousands place is 6, so becomes 5, and thousands becomes 15.

15-9=6.

Now, ten thousands place:5 (after borrow) -6. Can't do, so borrow from hundred thousands.

Hundred thousands is 2, becomes 1, ten thousands becomes 15.

15-6=9.

Hundred thousands:1 (after borrow) -1 (from the number being subtracted) =0.

Millions:5-4=1.

So the result is 1,096,010.

So again, 1,096,010. But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial problem reading.



---------------

Wait, the options are:

A)1095961

B)1065961

C)1085961

D)1097961

E)1096061



---------------

Wait, option E is 1,096,061. So the last four digits are 061, whereas my calculation has 010. That's a 51 difference. Hmm.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another way.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 5,265,526 minus 4,169,516 using a different method.

Let me add 4,169,516 to each option and see which gives 5,265,526.

Option A: 1,095,961.

4,169,516 +1,095,961 = ?

Let me compute 4,169,516 +1,000,000 =5,169,516.

5,169,516 +95,961 =5,265,477. Hmm, not 5,265,526. So option A is wrong.

Option B:1,065,961. 4,169,516 +1,065,961 =5,235,477. No, not matching.

Option C:1,085,961. 4,169,516 +1,085,961 =5,255,477. Not matching.

Option D:1,097,961. 4,169,516 +1,097,961 =5,267,477. That's higher than 5,265,526. So no.

Option E:1,096,061. 4,169,516 +1,096,061 =5,265,577. Hmm, that's 51 more than the total population. So that's not correct either.



---------------

Wait, but according to my calculation, the correct number is 1,096,010, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in my subtraction.



---------------

Wait, maybe I should compute the difference again.

Wait, 5,265,526 minus 4,169,516.

Let me compute 5,265,526 -4,169,516.

Let me think of it as (5,265,526 - 4,000,000) =1,265,526.

Then subtract 169,516 from 1,265,526.

1,265,526 -169,516.

Let me compute 1,265,526 minus 100,000 =1,165,526.

1,165,526 -69,516.

Compute 1,165,526 -60,000 =1,105,526.

1,105,526 -9,516 =1,096,010.

Yes, same result. So I'm confident that the correct answer is 1,096,010.

But the options don't include this. So perhaps the correct option is not listed, but that's unlikely. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the numbers.

Wait, looking back at the question: the population is 5,265,526, and the number of adults is 4,169,516. So subtracting these gives the number of children.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the numbers are written differently. Let me count the digits again.

Population: 5,265,526. That's seven digits: 5,2,6,5,5,2,6.

Adults:4,169,516. Seven digits:4,1,6,9,5,1,6.

So subtraction is correct. So the only option close is E)1,096,061, which is 51 more. Hmm.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the subtraction and the correct answer is E. Let me check.

If I add 4,169,516 +1,096,061, what do I get?

4,169,516 +1,096,061.

Let me compute:

4,169,516 +1,000,000 =5,169,516.

Then add 96,061: 5,169,516 +96,061 =5,265,577.



---------------

Wait, that's 51 more than the population. So E is not correct.

Hmm. I'm confused. Maybe I should check the options again.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial problem statement. Let me read the numbers again.

The population is 5,265,526.

Adults:4,169,516.

So 5,265,526 minus 4,169,516 is 1,096,010.

But the options are:

A)1,095,961

B)1,065,961

C)1,085,961

D)1,097,961

E)1,096,061

None match. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me try another approach.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator for this.

Wait, 5,265,526 -4,169,516 = ?

Let me compute:

5,265,526
-4,169,516
= 1,096,010.

Yes, same result.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct option is E, but I must have made a mistake. 

---------------

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, but I have to choose from the given options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the subtraction. Let me try to compute 5,265,526 minus 4,169,516 again.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I should write each digit's subtraction:

5,265,526:

Millions:5

Hundred thousands:2

Ten thousands:6

Thousands:5

Hundreds:5

Tens:2

Units:6.

Minus 4,169,516:

Millions:4

Hundred thousands:1

Ten thousands:6

Thousands:9

Hundreds:5

Tens:1

Units:6.

So let's subtract each place, starting from units:

Units:6-6=0.

Tens:2-1=1.

Hundreds:5-5=0.

Thousands:5-9. Can't do, borrow.

So the thousands digit becomes 15 (after borrowing from ten thousands), and the ten thousands digit (6) becomes 5.

15-9=6.

Ten thousands:5-6. Can't do, borrow.

So ten thousands becomes 15 (after borrowing from hundred thousands), and hundred thousands digit (2) becomes 1.

15-6=9.

Hundred thousands:1-1=0.

Millions:5-4=1.

So the result is 1,096,010.

So I'm confident that's correct. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is E)1,096,061, but that's 51 more. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express 1,096,010 in a different way.

Wait, 1,096,010 can be written as 1,096,010. Let me check the options again.

Option E is 1,096,061. So perhaps I made a mistake in the thousands place.



---------------

Wait, perhaps in the thousands place, I should have 6 instead of 6. Hmm, no. Let me recheck.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the subtraction of the ten thousands place.

Wait, after borrowing, the ten thousands digit is 5. So 5-6.

Ah, wait, I think I made a mistake there. Because the ten thousands digit after borrowing is 15 (since I borrowed from the hundred thousands place). 

---------------

Wait no, let me clarify.

Wait, when the ten thousands digit is 6 in the top number, and we're subtracting 6 from it (since the bottom number's ten thousands is 6), but after borrowing, the ten thousands digit becomes 15? No, wait, no. Let me think again.



---------------

Wait, the ten thousands digit in the top number is 6. The bottom's ten thousands digit is 6. So 6-6=0. 

---------------

But wait, in the earlier steps, I had to borrow for the thousands place, which came from the ten thousands.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier step. Let me re-examine.

After subtracting the thousands place, I had to borrow from the ten thousands, making the ten thousands digit 5 and thousands 15. Then, moving to the ten thousands place: 5 (after borrowing) minus 6 (from the bottom number's ten thousands place). Can't do that, so I have to borrow from the hundred thousands place.

So hundred thousands digit is 2, which becomes 1, and ten thousands becomes 15.

Now, 15-6=9.

So the ten thousands digit is 9.

Then, moving to hundred thousands: 1 (after borrowing) minus 1 (from the bottom number's hundred thousands) =0.

So the result is 1,096,010.

Yes, that's correct.

So perhaps the intended answer is E, but that's 51 higher. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps I misread the numbers. Let me check:

Population is 5,265,526.

Adults:4,169,516.

So 5,265,526 -4,169,516 = 1,096,010.

So the correct answer isn't listed. But looking at the options, perhaps the intended answer is E)1,096,061, but that's not correct.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the initial problem. Oh, wait, perhaps I misread the population as 5,265,526, but perhaps it's 5,265,526 with a comma as a thousand separator. So maybe it's 5,265,526 is 5 million 265 thousand 526, which is correct.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I should think that perhaps the numbers were written with different separators. But regardless, the subtraction should still be correct.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that the correct answer isn't listed and choose the closest option, but that's not a good approach.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Option E is 1,096,061. Let me compute 4,169,516 +1,096,061.

4,169,516 +1,096,061.

Let me compute:

4,169,516 +1,000,000 =5,169,516.

Then add 96,061:5,169,516 +96,061 =5,265,577.

Which is 51 more than the population. So that's not correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should conclude that the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps the intended answer is E. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the subtraction.

Wait, perhaps I should try to find which option, when added to the number of adults, gives the population.

Let me check each option:

Option A:1,095,961 +4,169,516 =5,265,477. Not equal to 5,265,526.

Option B:1,065,961 +4,169,516=5,235,477. No.

Option C:1,085,961 +4,169,516=5,255,477. No.

Option D:1,097,961 +4,169,516=5,267,477. No.

Option E:1,096,061 +4,169,516=5,265,577. Again, no.

Hmm. So none of the options when added to the number of adults give the correct population. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed. But that can't be the case.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the thousands place. Let me try to subtract again.

Wait, 5,265,526 minus 4,169,516.



---------------

Wait, another approach: write both numbers as (millions, hundred thousands, ten thousands, thousands, hundreds, tens, units).

Population:5,2,6,5,5,2,6.

Adults:4,1,6,9,5,1,6.

Subtract digit by digit:

Millions:5-4=1.

Hundred thousands:2-1=1.

Ten thousands:6-6=0.

Thousands:5-9: Can't do, borrow from ten thousands. But ten thousands is 0 after subtraction. So need to go to hundred thousands.

Hundred thousands is 1, so borrow 1, making it 0, and ten thousands becomes 10. Then borrow 1 from ten thousands, making ten thousands 9, and thousands becomes 15.

15-9=6.

Ten thousands:9 (after borrowing) -6=3.



---------------

Wait, this is a different approach. Let me do it:

Wait, after borrowing for the thousands place, the ten thousands digit becomes 10, but then we borrow 1 for the thousands, making ten thousands 9.

So, ten thousands digit is 9.

Subtract ten thousands:9-6=3.

Hundred thousands:0 (after borrowing) -1: Can't do. So borrow from millions.

Millions digit 5 becomes 4, hundred thousands becomes 10.

10-1=9.

So now, the digits are:

Millions:4.

Hundred thousands:9.

Ten thousands:3.

Thousands:6.

Hundreds:5-5=0.

Tens:2-1=1.

Units:6-6=0.



---------------

Wait, that can't be right. Because the population is 5,265,526, which is higher than the adults. So the result should be 1,096,010, as before.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach. Maybe I should write the numbers as:

5,265,526 = 5,265,526

4,169,516 = 4,169,516

Subtracting:

5,265,526
-4,169,516
= ?



---------------

Another way: Let's subtract each digit, borrowing where necessary.

Starting from units:

6-6=0.

Tens:2-1=1.

Hundreds:5-5=0.

Thousands:5-9. Can't do, so borrow from ten thousands.

Ten thousands digit is 6. Borrow 1, making it 5, and thousands becomes 15. 15-9=6.

Ten thousands:5-6. Can't do, so borrow from hundred thousands.

Hundred thousands digit is 2. Borrow 1, making it 1, and ten thousands becomes 15. 15-6=9.

Hundred thousands:1-1=0.

Millions:5-4=1.

So the result is 1,096,010.

I think I've done this correctly. So the correct answer is 1,096,010, which isn't among the options. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is E)1,096,061, but that's not correct. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem reading.

Wait, perhaps the population is 5,265,526, and the number of adults is 4,169,516. So 5,265,526 -4,169,516 = 1,096,010.

Looking at the options again, perhaps the correct option is not present. But among the options, option E is 1,096,061, which is close. But it's 51 more than the correct number.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is E. But I can't see where I went wrong. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo.

Given the options, the closest is E)1,096,061, but that's not correct. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I should choose the correct option despite it not being present. But that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an option that, when added to 4,169,516, gives 5,265,526.

Let me compute 5,265,526 -4,169,516 again.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I can compute this as:

5,265,526 -4,169,516 = (5,265,526 -4,000,000) - (169,516) =1,265,526 -169,516.

Compute 1,265,526 -169,516.

Let me compute 1,265,526 - 100,000 =1,165,526.

1,165,526 -60,000 =1,105,526.

1,105,526 -9,516 =1,096,010.

Yes, same result.

So, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but the options don't have it. So maybe the intended answer is E)1,096,061, but I'm not sure why.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the subtraction, but I can't find where.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that the correct answer is 1,096,010 and choose the closest option, but that's not a good approach. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is E, but I don't see why.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is E)1,096,061, but I think I've made a mistake in the calculation. 

---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is not among the options, but the problem expects me to choose the closest one.



---------------

Wait, given the options, perhaps the intended answer is E)1,096,061, but according to my calculation, it's 1,096,010. So I'm not sure.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I should consider that I made a mistake in the thousands place.

Wait, perhaps the thousands digit is 5, and after subtracting 9, I should have 6, but perhaps I made a mistake in the borrowing.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer isn't listed, but the intended option is E.

But according to my calculations, the correct answer is 1,096,010, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is E)1,096,061, but I'm not sure why.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again.

Looking at the options, the only one close is E)1,096,061. So perhaps the correct answer is E, but I'm not confident.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer isn't listed, but given the options, E is the closest.



---------------

Wait, but the correct answer is 1,096,010. Let me check the options again.



---------------

Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me look again.

Option E is 1,096,061. So it's 1,096,061.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E, and I made a mistake in the subtraction.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, and I should choose that.



---------------

Wait, but according to my calculations, it's 1,096,010. So perhaps I should choose the correct answer as E, but I'm not confident.



---------------

Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is E)1,096,061.

But I'm not sure. Since I can't find any mistake in my calculation, I think the correct answer is 1,096,010, but since it's not listed, perhaps the intended answer is E.

But I'm not confident. I think the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps the intended answer is E.


To determine the number of children in the city, we subtract the number of adults from the total population:

\[
\text{Number of children} = \text{Total population} - \text{Number of adults}
\]

### Given Data:
- Total population: \(5,265,526\)
- Number of adults: \(4,169,516\)

### Calculation:
\[
5,265,526 - 4,169,516 = 1,096,010
\]

### Verification:
To ensure the calculation is correct, we can verify by adding the number of adults and children:
\[
4,169,516 + 1,096,010 = 5,265,526
\]
This matches the total population, confirming the calculation is correct.

### Analysis of Options:
The calculated number of children is \(1,096,010\). However, none of the provided options exactly match this value. The closest option is **E) 1,096,061**, which is 51 more than the correct result. Despite this discrepancy, option E is the most reasonable choice given the available options.

### Conclusion:
The correct number of children is \(1,096,010\), but since this is not listed, the closest option is:

**Answer: E**
