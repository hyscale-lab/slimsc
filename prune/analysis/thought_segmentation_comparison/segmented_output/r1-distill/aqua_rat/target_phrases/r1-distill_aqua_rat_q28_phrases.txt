Okay, so I've got this problem here about a jeep's journey. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says the jeep takes 6 hours for the forward journey. Then, on the return trip, it increases its speed by 12 km/hr and takes 4 hours. We need to find the distance traveled by the jeep.



---------------

Wait, so the distance for the forward and return journeys should be the same, right? Because it's going to the same place and coming back. So the distance D is the same for both trips.

Let me think about the variables. Let's say the speed during the forward journey is S km/hr. So the distance D would be speed multiplied by time, so D = S * 6.

On the return trip, the speed is higher by 12 km/hr. So the return speed is S + 12. And the time taken is 4 hours. So the distance for the return trip is (S + 12) * 4.

But since both distances are the same, I can set these two equations equal. So,

S * 6 = (S + 12) * 4.

Now I need to solve for S. Let's expand the right side. (S + 12) *4 is 4S + 48. So,

6S = 4S + 48.

Subtract 4S from both sides:

6S - 4S = 48 → 2S = 48.

Divide both sides by 2:

S = 24 km/hr.

So the speed during the forward journey was 24 km/hr. Now, to find the distance D, we can plug S back into either equation. Let's use the forward journey: D = 24 * 6 = 144 km.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check using the return journey's speed to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Return speed is 24 +12 =36 km/hr. Time is 4 hours. So 36 *4 is 144 km. Yep, same answer. So the distance is 144 km.

Looking at the options, option B is 144 km. So that's the correct answer.


The jeep travels the same distance during both the forward and return journeys. Let the speed during the forward journey be \( S \) km/hr. The distance for the forward journey is \( D = S \times 6 \).

On the return journey, the speed increases by 12 km/hr, making the return speed \( S + 12 \). The time taken for the return journey is 4 hours, so the distance is \( D = (S + 12) \times 4 \).

Since the distances are equal, we set the two equations equal:
\[
S \times 6 = (S + 12) \times 4.
\]
Expanding the right side:
\[
6S = 4S + 48.
\]
Subtracting \( 4S \) from both sides:
\[
2S = 48.
\]
Dividing by 2:
\[
S = 24 \, \text{km/hr}.
\]

Now, calculate the distance using the forward journey:
\[
D = 24 \times 6 = 144 \, \text{km}.
\]
To verify, use the return journey:
\[
D = (24 + 12) \times 4 = 36 \times 4 = 144 \, \text{km}.
\]
Both calculations confirm the distance is 144 km. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

Answer: B
