Okay, so I've got this problem here about ten lime soda bottles and splitting them into two groups of five each. The question is asking how many ways there are to create these two groups. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.



---------------

Wait, so there are ten bottles, and they need to be divided into two groups, each with five members. So each group gets exactly five bottles. 

---------------

But wait, the groups are different because the customers are two different groups. Oh, but wait, the problem says "two different groups of customers consisting of 5 members each." So does that mean the order of the groups matters? Like, group A and group B are distinct because they're different customers, so swapping the groups would count as a different way? Or maybe not, I'm not sure.



---------------

Wait, no, the problem says "to create these 2 groups." Hmm, perhaps the groups are considered distinct because they're serving different customers. So the way we split the bottles into group 1 and group 2 matters.

Let me approach this mathematically. The number of ways to choose 5 bottles out of 10 is given by the combination formula, which is C(10,5). That would be 252 ways. 

---------------

But wait, once I choose 5 bottles for group 1, the remaining 5 automatically go to group 2. 

---------------

But wait, does this count each division twice? Because choosing group 1 as ABCDE and group 2 as FGHIJ is the same as choosing group 2 as ABCDE and group 1 as FGHIJ if the groups are not labeled. But in this case, the groups are serving different customers, so perhaps they are labeled as group 1 and group 2. Or maybe not. The problem says "two different groups of customers", which might imply that the order matters. Or perhaps it's just about the division, not the order. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.



---------------

Wait, the problem is about creating two groups. If the groups are distinguishable (like group A and group B), then the number of ways would be C(10,5) because after selecting group A, group B is fixed. But if the groups are indistinct (i.e., the order doesn't matter), then the number would be C(10,5)/2 because each division is counted twice in the combination count.



---------------

Wait, let me think again. Suppose I have 10 items and I split them into two groups of 5. If the two groups are considered the same (like two identical boxes), then the number of ways is C(10,5)/2. But if the groups are different (like labeled as group 1 and group 2), then it's C(10,5).

In this problem, the groups are serving different customers. So each group is a distinct entity. So the order matters. So each way of selecting group 1 and group 2 is unique.



---------------

Wait, but in reality, when you choose group 1 as ABCDE, group 2 is FGHIJ. 

---------------

Alternatively, if you choose group 2 as ABCDE, group 1 is FGHIJ. But in this case, since the groups are serving different customers, those two scenarios are different. 

---------------

Wait no, because the customers are different, so maybe the group assignments are fixed. Wait, perhaps the customers are group A and group B, and we're assigning the 10 bottles into group A and group B. So each way of choosing 5 for group A is a distinct way, and the remaining go to group B. So the total number of ways would be C(10,5) = 252.



---------------

Wait, but let me make sure. Let's say the two groups are group X and group Y. If I choose 5 bottles for X, the other 5 go to Y. Each such selection is a unique arrangement. So the number of possible assignments is 252.

Looking at the options, option D is 252. So the answer should be D.



---------------

Wait, but wait another thought. Suppose the groups are considered the same. Then the number would be 252 / 2 = 126, which is option C. But the problem says "two different groups of customers", so the groups are different, so we shouldn't divide by 2. So the correct answer is 252, which is option D.


To determine the number of ways to create two groups of 5 customers each from 10 lime soda bottles, we use combinatorial reasoning. The problem specifies that the two groups are "different groups of customers," implying that the groups are distinguishable. This means that assigning 5 bottles to group 1 and the remaining 5 to group 2 is distinct from assigning 5 bottles to group 2 and the remaining 5 to group 1.

The number of ways to choose 5 bottles out of 10 is given by the combination formula:

\[
\binom{10}{5} = \frac{10!}{5! \cdot 5!} = 252
\]

Since the groups are distinguishable, each selection of 5 bottles for group 1 automatically defines group 2, and no division by 2 is necessary. Therefore, the total number of ways to create the two groups is 252.

From the given options:
- **A) 90**: Incorrect, as it does not match the combinatorial calculation.
- **B) 105**: Incorrect, as it does not match the combinatorial calculation.
- **C) 126**: Incorrect, as dividing by 2 would only apply if the groups were indistinguishable, which is not the case here.
- **D) 252**: Correct, as it matches the combinatorial calculation.
- **E) 525**: Incorrect, as it exceeds the calculated value.

Thus, the correct answer is **D) 252**.

Answer: D
