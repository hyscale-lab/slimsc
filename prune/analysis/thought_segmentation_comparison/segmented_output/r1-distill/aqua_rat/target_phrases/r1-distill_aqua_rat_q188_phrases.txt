Okay, so I've got this problem here about ten lime soda bottles and dividing them into two groups of five each. The question is asking how many ways there are to create these two groups. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.



---------------

Wait, so the setup is that there are ten bottles, and we need to split them into two groups, each with five members. And these groups are for two different sets of customers. 

---------------

But wait, are the groups labeled or not? Like, does it matter which group is which, or are they just two groups without any distinction?

I remember that when you split a set into two groups, if the groups are considered the same (like indistinct), you have to divide by 2 to account for the duplication. Because choosing group A and group B is the same as group B and group A. But if the groups are distinct, like labeled as group 1 and group 2, then you don't divide by 2.

In this problem, the groups are going to different sets of customers. So I think that makes them distinct. So, for example, group 1 is served to the first five customers, and group 2 to the other five. So the order matters, so we don't divide by 2.

So the problem becomes, how many ways to choose 5 bottles out of 10 for group 1, and the remaining 5 automatically go to group 2. So that would be the combination of 10 choose 5.

The formula for combinations is n choose k = n!/(k! (n-k)!). So 10 choose 5 would be 10!/(5!5!) = let me calculate that.



---------------

Wait, 10! is 3628800. 5! is 120, so 5!5! is 120*120=14400. So 3628800 divided by 14400. Let me do that division. 3628800 / 14400.

Hmm, 14400 times 250 is 3,600,000, which is a bit more than 3,628,800. 

---------------

Wait, maybe I should simplify the fraction before multiplying out.

10! = 10×9×8×7×6×5! So 10×9×8×7×6 = 30240. Then divided by (5!5!) which is 120×120. So 30240 / (14400) = 2.1? 

---------------

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 30240 divided by 14400: 14400 * 2 = 28800. 30240 - 28800 = 1440. So that's 2 and 1440/14400 = 0.1. So 2.1? That can't be right because 10 choose 5 is a well-known number. 

---------------

Oh wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 10 choose 5 is 252. Because I remember that 10 choose 5 is 252. So 252 ways. So the number is 252.

Looking at the options, option D is 252. So that should be the answer.



---------------

Wait, but let me double-check. If the groups were indistinct, then it would be 10 choose 5 divided by 2, which would be 126. But since the groups are serving different customers, they're distinct. So no division by 2, so 252 is correct.


To determine the number of ways to divide ten lime soda bottles into two groups of five each for two distinct sets of customers, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose 5 bottles out of 10 for the first group. The remaining 5 bottles will automatically form the second group. Since the groups are distinct (they serve different sets of customers), we do not need to divide by 2 to account for duplication.

The number of ways to choose 5 bottles out of 10 is given by the combination formula:

\[
\binom{10}{5} = \frac{10!}{5! \cdot 5!}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
10! = 3,628,800, \quad 5! = 120, \quad \text{so } 5! \cdot 5! = 120 \cdot 120 = 14,400
\]

\[
\binom{10}{5} = \frac{3,628,800}{14,400} = 252
\]

Thus, there are 252 ways to create the two groups. Since the groups are distinct, no further adjustments are needed. The correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
