Okay, so I have this problem here about dividing ten lime soda bottles into two groups of five each. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when you have to split items into groups, the approach depends on whether the groups are labeled or not. Like, if the groups are different (like Group A and Group B), the calculation is different than if they're the same.



---------------

Wait, the problem says two different groups of customers, each with five members. Oh, so each group is distinct because they're different sets of customers. So the order might matter here. Or does it? I'm a bit confused.



---------------

Wait, wait, let me break it down. The question is asking how many ways to create these two groups. So it's about partitioning ten people into two groups of five each. So each group is a subset of size five.

I think the formula for this involves combinations. The number of ways to choose 5 people out of 10 is C(10,5). 

---------------

But wait, if I do that, I might be double-counting because choosing group A and group B is the same as choosing group B and group A. Or am I?



---------------

Wait, no, because the groups are different. Like, if the two groups are going to different tables or something, then the order matters. So each division into group 1 and group 2 counts as a unique arrangement. So in that case, it's just C(10,5).



---------------

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. When you split into two groups, if the groups are indistinct, meaning group A and group B are the same as group B and group A, then you would divide by 2. But here, the groups are different because they are serving two different groups of customers. So each selection is unique.



---------------

Wait, so the total number of ways would be C(10,5) = 252. 

---------------

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 252. So that's one of the choices.



---------------

But wait, another thought. Maybe the problem is about arranging the ten bottles into two groups, but the problem statement says "to be served among two different groups of customers consisting of 5 members each." So each group gets five bottles. So the number of ways is the number of ways to choose 5 bottles for the first group, and the remaining 5 automatically go to the second group.

But since the groups are different, each choice is unique. So the number is C(10,5), which is 252. So the answer should be D) 252.



---------------

Wait, but another perspective: sometimes when you split a group into two equal parts, you have to consider if the order matters. For example, if the two groups are labeled, like Team A and Team B, then each split is unique. But if they're unlabeled, like just splitting into two groups without names, then you divide by 2.

In this problem, the two groups are different because they're serving different groups of customers. So each group is a distinct entity. So the order matters. So the number is C(10,5) = 252.

So looking at the options, D is 252. So the answer should be D.


To solve the problem of determining how many ways there are to create two distinct groups of 5 customers each from 10 lime soda bottles, we use combinatorics. The key is to recognize that the two groups are distinct because they serve different sets of customers. 

The number of ways to choose 5 bottles out of 10 for the first group is given by the combination formula:

\[
\binom{10}{5} = \frac{10!}{5! \cdot 5!} = 252
\]

Since the groups are distinct, each selection is unique, and there is no need to divide by 2 to account for identical groupings. Thus, the total number of ways to create the two groups is 252.

Answer: D
