Okay, so I've got this problem about a cereal mixture. Let me try to understand what it's asking. The mixture has rice, wheat, and corn in the ratio of 2:3:5. And I know that a bag contains 3 pounds of rice. I need to find out how much corn is in the bag.

Hmm, ratios can sometimes trip me up, but I think I can handle this. Ratios compare the quantities of each component, right? So the ratio 2:3:5 means for every 2 parts of rice, there are 3 parts of wheat and 5 parts of corn.

Wait, but how does that translate to actual pounds? Well, the total number of parts is 2 + 3 + 5. Let me add those up: 2+3 is 5, plus 5 is 10. So there are 10 parts in total.

Now, the bag has 3 pounds of rice, and rice corresponds to 2 parts of the ratio. So each part must be equal in weight. Let me think. If 2 parts equal 3 pounds, then one part is 3 divided by 2. Let me calculate that: 3 / 2 is 1.5. So each part is 1.5 pounds.

Wait, but let me double-check. If each part is 1.5 pounds, then 2 parts (rice) would be 3 pounds, which matches the given. Then wheat would be 3 parts, so 3 * 1.5 = 4.5 pounds. Corn is 5 parts, so 5 * 1.5 = 7.5 pounds. That adds up to 3 + 4.5 + 7.5 = 15 pounds in total.

But wait, the question doesn't mention the total weight, so maybe I don't need that. 

But I just need to find the amount of corn. So, 5 parts, each part is 1.5 pounds. 5 * 1.5 is 7.5. So the corn should be 7.5 pounds.

Looking at the options, B is 7.5, so that's the answer.

But wait, are there any other possibilities? Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the ratio in terms of fractions. The ratio of rice to the total is 2/(2+3+5) = 2/10 = 1/5. So if the rice is 3 pounds, the total mixture is 3 * 5 = 15 pounds. Then, corn is 5/10 of the total, which is 5/10 *15 = 7.5 pounds. Yep, same result.

So I'm confident that the answer is 7.5 pounds. Looking at the options, option B is 7.5, so that should be the correct answer.


The cereal mixture contains rice, wheat, and corn in the ratio of 2:3:5. To find the amount of corn in the bag, we first determine the total number of parts:  
\[
2 + 3 + 5 = 10 \text{ parts}.
\]  
Rice corresponds to 2 parts, and the bag contains 3 pounds of rice. Since 2 parts equal 3 pounds, each part weighs:  
\[
\frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ pounds per part}.
\]  
Corn corresponds to 5 parts, so the amount of corn is:  
\[
5 \times 1.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}.
\]  
Thus, the bag contains 7.5 pounds of corn. The correct answer is **B) 7.5**.

Answer: B
