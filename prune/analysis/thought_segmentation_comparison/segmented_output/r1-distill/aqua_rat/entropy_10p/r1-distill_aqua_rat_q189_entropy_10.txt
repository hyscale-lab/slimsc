Okay, so I've got this problem here about a cereal mixture. Hmm, let me read it again. The mixture has rice, wheat, and corn in the ratio of 2:3:5. Oh

---------------

 right, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but I think I can handle it.

The question says that a bag contains 3 pounds of rice. I need to find out how much corn it has. So

---------------

, let me break this down. Ratios are about parts. So rice is 2 parts, wheat is 3 parts, and corn is 5 parts. 



---------------

Wait, so if rice is 2 parts and equals 3 pounds, I can figure out what one part equals. Because

---------------

 once I know the value per part, I can multiply it by the number of parts for corn, which is 5.

So, rice

---------------

 is 2 parts = 3 pounds. To find one part, I divide 3 by 2. Let me calculate that: 3 ÷ 2 is 1.5. So each part is 1.5 pounds.

Now, corn is 5 parts. So 5 parts multiplied by 1.5 pounds per part. 5 times 1.5 is... let me do that math. 5 * 1.5 is 7.5. So the corn should be 7.5 pounds.

Wait, looking

---------------

 at the options, option B is 7.5. So that's the answer, right? But wait, let me double-check my

---------------

 steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, the ratio: 2:3:5. So total

---------------

 parts are 2+3+5=10 parts. But wait, wait, maybe I don't need the total.

---------------

 Because the problem only relates rice to corn. So the approach I took is correct. Since rice is 2 parts and equals

---------------

 3 pounds, each part is 1.5. So corn is 5 parts, so 5 * 1.5=7.5. Yeah

---------------

, that seems right.

But wait another thought: Sometimes, when dealing with ratios, it's the total that matters. But

---------------

 in this problem, they're only asking about corn relative to rice, not the total mixture. So my initial approach is correct because I

---------------

 only need the proportion between rice and corn.

So yeah, the answer should be 7.5 pounds of corn. Looking back at the options, option B is 7.5. So the correct answer is B.


The cereal mixture contains rice, wheat, and corn in the ratio of 2:3:5. Since rice corresponds to 2 parts and is given as 3 pounds, one part of the mixture is equal to \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) pounds. Corn corresponds to 5 parts, so the amount of corn is \( 5 \times 1.5 = 7.5 \) pounds. Among the options provided, the correct answer is **B) 7.5**.
