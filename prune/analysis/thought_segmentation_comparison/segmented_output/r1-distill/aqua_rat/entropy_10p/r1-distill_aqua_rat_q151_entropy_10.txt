Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and

---------------

 think about what each part means.

The question says that a candidate secured 504 marks out of the maximum mark M. So, the

---------------

 candidate's score is 504, and the total possible is M. Then, it says that if the maximum mark M is converted into 800 marks, the candidate would have secured 420 marks. Hmm, I need to find M.

Wait, I

---------------

'm a bit confused. What does it mean to convert M into 800 marks? Oh, I think it means scaling the maximum

---------------

 score. Like, if the total possible is M, and we change it to 800, then the candidate's score also

---------------

 scales accordingly. So, 504 out of M would be equivalent to 420 out of 800.

---------------

 That makes sense.

So, I can model this as a proportion. The ratio of the candidate's score to the maximum should

---------------

 remain the same when M is converted to 800. So, 504/M should equal 420/800. Let

---------------

 me write that down as an equation.

504 / M = 420 / 800.

Now, I can solve for M. Cross-multiplying gives

---------------

 me 504 * 800 = 420 * M. Wait, let me calculate that.

First

---------------

, 504 multiplied by 800. Hmm, 500 * 800 is 400,000, and 4*800 is 3,200. So,

---------------

 400,000 + 3,200 is 403,200. So, 504 * 800 = 403200.

On the other side, 420 * M equals

---------------

 403200. So, M is 403200 divided by 420.

Let me compute that. 403200 / 420. Let

---------------

's see, 420 goes into 403200 how many times? Maybe simplify the division.

I

---------------

 can factor both numerator and denominator. Let's see, 420 is 42 * 10, which is 6*7 * 10. 

---------------

403200 divided by 420: perhaps I can divide numerator and denominator by 420's

---------------

 factors.

Wait, another approach. Let's see, 420 * 900 is 378,000. Subtract

---------------

 that from 403200: 403200 - 378000 = 25200. Now, 420 * 60 is 25200. So 900 + 60 = 960. So M is 960.

Let me double-check that

---------------

. If M is 960, then 504 is what percentage of 960? Let's calculate 504/960. Simpl

---------------

ify that fraction. Both are divisible by 24? Let's see, 504 ÷24 is 21, 960 ÷24 is 40. So 21/40 is 0.525, which is 52.5%. Now, if

---------------

 M is converted to 800, what's 52.5% of 800? 0.525 * 800 = 420. That

---------------

 matches the question. So yes, M is 960.

Looking at the options, E is 960. So the answer should be E.


The problem involves finding the maximum mark \( M \) given that a candidate scored 504 marks out of \( M \), and when \( M \) is converted to 800 marks, the candidate's score becomes 420. To solve this, we set up the proportion:

\[
\frac{504}{M} = \frac{420}{800}.
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
504 \times 800 = 420 \times M.
\]

Calculating \( 504 \times 800 \):

\[
504 \times 800 = 403200.
\]

Thus

---------------

, the equation becomes:

\[
403200 = 420 \times M.
\]

Solving for \( M \):

\[
M = \frac{403200}{420} = 960.
\]

To verify, if \( M = 960 \), the candidate's score as a percentage is:

\[
\frac{504}{960} = 0.525 = 52.5\%.
\]

When \( M \) is converted to 800, the candidate's score is:

\[
0.525 \times 800 = 420,
\]

which matches the given condition. Therefore, the value of \( M \) is **960**, corresponding to option E.
