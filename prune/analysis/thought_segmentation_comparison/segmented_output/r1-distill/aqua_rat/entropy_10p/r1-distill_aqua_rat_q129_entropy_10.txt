Okay, so I have this problem here about an astronaut's weight on Earth and Venus. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, the question says the astronaut weighs 211 pounds on Earth and 182 pounds on Venus. I need to find what percent 182 is of 211.

Wait, percentage

---------------

 problems can sometimes trip me up, but I think I remember the formula. Oh right, to find what percent one number is of another, I divide the part by the whole and then multiply by 100. So in this case, the part is the Venus weight, 182, and the whole is the Earth weight, 211.

So I should calculate 182 divided by 211. Let me get

---------------

 my calculator out. 182 ÷ 211 equals... Hmm, let me compute that. 211 goes into 182 zero

---------------

 times. Wait, that's not right. Oh wait, no, wait. 182 is less than 211, so the result will be less than 1. Let me actually

---------------

 compute it.

182 divided by 211. Let's see, 211 times 0.8 is 168.8, which

---------------

 is less than 182. 0.85 would be 211 * 0.85 = 179.35. Still less than 182. Let

---------------

's try 0.86: 211 * 0.86. Let me calculate 200*0.86=172, 11*0.86=9.46, so total is 181.46. Oh, that's really close to 182. So 0.86 would

---------------

 give about 181.46, which is just a little less than 182. So 182 is approximately

---------------

 0.86 times 211. So that's 86% because 0.86 times 100 is 86%.

Wait, but wait

---------------

 a second. Let me do the division more accurately. 182 ÷ 211.

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 I can compute it as a fraction and then convert to a percentage. So 182 over 211.

---------------

 Let me see, 211 is a prime number, I think, so it doesn't divide into 182 easily

---------------

. Let me do the division step by step.

211 goes into 182 zero times, so we add

---------------

 a decimal point and a zero, making it 1820. How many times does 211 go into 1820? Let me estimate

---------------

. 211 * 8 is 1688. 211 * 9 is 1899, which is too big because 1899 is more than 1820. So 8 times. 8 *211 is 1688. Subtract that from 1820: 1820 - 1688 is 132. Bring down the next zero, making it 1320.

211 goes into 1320 how many times? Let's see, 211 *6 is 1266. That

---------------

's under 1320. 211*7 is 1477, which is over. So 6 times. 6*211=1266. Subtract that: 1320-1266=54. Bring down a zero, making 540.

211 into 540. Let me see, 2*211=422. 3*211=633, which is too big. So 2 times. 2*211=422. Subtract: 540-422=118. Bring down a zero, making 1180.

211 into 1180. Let's see, 5*211=1055. 6*211=1266 which is too big. So 5 times. 5*211=1055. Subtract: 1180-1055=125. Bring down a zero, making 1250.

211 into 1250: 5 times because

---------------

 5*211=1055. 6*211 is 1266, which is more

---------------

 than 1250. So 5 times. 1055 subtracted from 1250 is 195. Hmm, this

---------------

 is getting a bit lengthy, but I think the trend is that the decimal is approximately 0.862.

So 0.862 times

---------------

 100 is 86.2%. So the percentage is approximately 86%, which would correspond to option D. Looking

---------------

 back at the options, D is 86%.


To determine what percent the astronaut's weight on Venus (182 pounds) is of their weight on Earth (211 pounds), we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100
\]

Here, the "Part" is 182 (Venus weight), and the "Whole" is 211 (Earth weight). Substituting these values:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{182}{211} \right) \times 100
\]

Performing the division \( \frac{182}{211} \), we find that it is approximately 0.86. Multiplying by 100 gives:

\[
\text{Percentage} \approx 86\%
\]

Thus, the astronaut's weight on Venus is approximately 86% of their weight on Earth. Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**D) 86%**
