Okay, so I have this problem about a room's height and semi-perimeter. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says the height to semi-perimeter ratio is 2:5. So

---------------

, I'll note that down as H:S = 2:5, where H is height and S is semi-perimeter.

Wait, what

---------------

's the semi-perimeter of a room? Oh right, a room is usually a rectangular box, so it has a length and width. The semi-perimeter would be half the perimeter of the floor, which is (L + W)/2.

---------------

 So, S = (L + W)/2.

The ratio H:S is 2:5, so H/S = 2/5. So H = (2/5) * S. Or

---------------

, S = (5/2) * H. I'll keep that in mind.

Next part of the problem is about the cost to paper the walls. It costs Rs.260, using paper that's 50cm wide, at

---------------

 Rs.2 per meter. They also allowed 15 sq.m for doors and windows.

Wait, papering the walls means

---------------

 covering the lateral surface area, right? So the area of the walls is the perimeter times the height. But we have to subtract the area for doors and windows.

Wait

---------------

, the total cost is Rs.260. The paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters. The cost per meter is Rs.2. Hmm, so

---------------

 I think the cost relates to the area of paper used. Because when you buy paper, you pay per meter length, but the area is

---------------

 width times length.

So, the paper's area used would be the length of the paper (which is the perimeter of the room,

---------------

 perhaps?) multiplied by the width of the paper. But wait, actually, you're covering the walls. So the total area of the walls is perimeter

---------------

 * height, minus the doors and windows area.

But the problem gives the cost, so let's think about how that relates

---------------

 to the area.

So, the paper cost is Rs.260. The paper is sold at Rs.2 per meter. Wait

---------------

, but paper is sold by the length, and each meter is 0.5m wide. So the area of paper bought

---------------

 is length (in meters) multiplied by 0.5m (width). So cost = (price per meter) * length.

---------------

 Because you buy L meters, each costing Rs.2, and each meter gives 0.5 m² of paper. So

---------------

 the area of paper is L * 0.5, and the cost is L * 2.

But wait, the

---------------

 cost is 260 Rs. So 260 = L * 2, so L = 130 meters. Hmm

---------------

, that's a lot. Wait, but that can't be right because 130 meters of paper is way too long for a room. Maybe

---------------

 I got that wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the cost is based on the area of the paper. Let me think again. The paper is 50 cm wide, so 0.5 meters. The

---------------

 price is Rs.2 per meter. Oh wait, per linear meter of paper. So, each linear meter is 0.5m wide and 1m long, so area per meter is 0.5 m². So

---------------

 the cost per m² of paper would be (2 Rs) / (0.5 m²) = 4 Rs per m². Wait

---------------

, no. Because you're buying 1m of paper, which is 0.5m², and you pay Rs.2 for that. So the

---------------

 cost per square meter is 2 Rs / 0.5 m² = 4 Rs/m². Hmm, but

---------------

 I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe the cost is calculated as the area of the walls (

---------------

minus doors and windows) times the price per m². Wait, but the problem states the cost is Rs.260 for papering, allowing

---------------

 15 sq.m for doors and windows.

Wait, perhaps the total area of the walls is equal to the area covered by the paper minus the 15 sq.m.

---------------

 Or wait, the papering area is the wall area minus the doors and windows.

Let me clarify. The problem says,

---------------

 "allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows." So when they paper the walls, they don't cover the doors and windows, so the area of

---------------

 paper used is (total wall area) minus 15.

But how do we find the total wall area? The wall area (excluding

---------------

 doors and windows) is equal to the perimeter of the room multiplied by the height, minus the 15 sq.m.

Wait, no, wait

---------------

. The total area of the four walls is 2*(L + W)*H. So that's the total wall area. But when

---------------

 papering, they don't cover the doors and windows, so the area of paper used is (2*(L+W)*H) - 15.

But

---------------

 the paper is bought in a certain width. So the area of the paper used would be equal to the length of paper (

---------------

let's say 'x' meters) multiplied by the width of the paper (0.5m). So, x * 0.5 = (2*(L + W)*H) - 15.

The

---------------

 cost is calculated as x meters of paper at Rs.2 per meter, so cost is 2*x = 260 Rs. So x = 130 meters. So

---------------

, 130 m * 0.5 m = 65 m² is the area of paper used.

So, 65 m² = (2*(L + W)*H) - 15.

Wait

---------------

, because 2*(L+W)*H is the total wall area, and subtracting 15 for doors and windows gives the papered area, which is 65 m².

So,

---------------

 2*(L+W)*H -15 = 65 → 2*(L+W)*H = 80 → (L+W)*H =40.

But from

---------------

 the first part, the ratio H:S =2:5, and S is (L+W)/2. So H /

---------------

 [ (L+W)/2 ] = 2/5 → H * 2 / (L + W) )=2/5 → (

---------------

2H)/(L+W) )=2/5 → (H)/(L+W) )=1/5 → H = (L+W)/5.

So, from

---------------

 this, (L+W) =5 H.

Now, substitute into (L + W) * H =40 → 5H * H =40 →5 H²=40 → H²=8 → H= sqrt(8) ≈ 2.828 m.

Wait, but looking

---------------

 at the options, none of them are 2.828. The options are A)2.6, B)3.9, C)4, D)4.2, E)4.4.

Hmm, that

---------------

's confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.

Let me go through again.

First, the cost: 260 Rs.

---------------

 The paper is 50 cm wide, Rs.2 per meter.

So, the length of paper bought is cost / (price per meter) → 260 / 2 = 130 meters. So 

---------------

130 meters of paper, each 0.5m wide, so area is 130 * 0.5 = 65 m².

That

---------------

's correct. So the papered area is 65 m².

But the papered area is the total wall area minus the doors and windows:

---------------

 2*(L+W)*H -15 =65 → 2*(L+W)*H =80 → (L + W)*H =40.

From

---------------

 the ratio: H:S=2:5, S is semi-perimeter (S= (L+W)/2).

So H / S =2/5 → H / [(L+W)/2] =2/5 → 

---------------

2H/(L+W) =2/5 → H/(L+W)=1/5 → H = (L + W)/5 → (L+W)=5H.

Substituting into (L+W)*H=40 → 5H * H=40 →5 H²=40 → H²=8 → H=√

---------------

8=2√2≈2.828 m.

Hmm, but that's not among the options. So I

---------------

 must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the doors and windows area is 15 m², so the total wall area is (paper area) + 15.

---------------

 Because when you paper, you cover the walls except doors and windows. So the paper area is (total wall area) minus 15.

Wait, no

---------------

. The paper covers the walls, but not the doors. So the area of paper used is (total wall area) minus 15. So,

---------------

 yes, paper area = total wall area - 15.

Wait, but earlier I thought 65 = total wall area -15, leading

---------------

 to total wall area =80. Which is correct. So, 2*(L+W)*H=80.

Then

---------------

, using H = (L+W)/5 → substituting, (L+W)=5H.

So 2*(5H)*H=80 →10 H²=80 →H²=8 →H=2.828.



---------------

But options don't have that. So perhaps I messed up the ratio.

Wait, the ratio is H:S=2:5. S

---------------

 is the semi-perimeter, which is (L + W)/2.

So H/S =2/5 → H =

---------------

 (2/5) S → S= (5/2) H.

But S is semi-perimeter, so (L + W)/2 = (5/2) H → L + W =5 H.

Yes

---------------

, that's what I did earlier.

So (L + W) =5 H.

Putting into (L + W)*H=40 →5 H * H=40 →5 H²=40 → H²=8 →H=2.828 m

---------------

.

Hmm, that's about 2.83 meters, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.



---------------

Wait, perhaps the semi-perimeter refers to the perimeter, not the semi. Let me check the problem statement again.

No

---------------

, the problem says "the height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5." So semi-perimeter is correct.

Wait

---------------

, maybe I'm miscalculating the wall area.

Wait, the wall area is 2*(L + W)*H.

Yes

---------------

, because for a rectangle, there are two walls of length L and height H, and two walls of width W and height H. So total

---------------

 area is 2LH + 2WH = 2H(L + W).

So that part is correct.

Wait

---------------

, maybe I made a mistake in the paper area calculation.

Let me think again. The paper is 50 cm wide, which

---------------

 is 0.5 m, and the cost is Rs.2 per meter. So each meter of paper is 1m long and 0.5m wide, so area per meter is 0.5 m². The

---------------

 cost per meter is Rs.2, so per square meter, the cost is 2 Rs /0.5 m² =4 Rs/m².

So

---------------

 the total area of paper used is 65 m², as I found before. So the cost is 65 *4 =260 Rs. That

---------------

's correct.

So that part is correct.

Hmm, but the height I'm getting is about 2.83 m, which isn't among

---------------

 the options. So maybe I made a mistake in the ratio.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is H:S = 2:5, but

---------------

 S is the perimeter, not the semi-perimeter.

Wait, let me recheck the problem statement: "the height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5." So the

---------------

 ratio is H:S =2:5, with S being semi-perimeter.

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps

---------------

 the wall area is (perimeter) * H. Perimeter is 2(L + W), so 2*(L+W)*H.

---------------

 Which is the same as 2H(L+W).

Wait, but in the ratio, S is semi-perimeter, so S=(L+W)/2.

So

---------------

, H/S=2/5 → H= (2/5) * (L + W)/2 → H = (L+W)/5 → same

---------------

 as before.

Hmm, so I'm stuck. Maybe I should try the options given and see which one fits.

Looking at the options, let

---------------

's try option B)3.9 m.

If H=3.9 m, then from H = (L + W)/5 → L + W =5 *3.9=19.5 m.

Then, (L + W)*H =19.5 *3.9 → let

---------------

's compute 19.5 *3.9.

19.5 *3=58.5, 19.5 *0.9=17.55. Sum is 58.5 +17.55=76.05.

So

---------------

 (L + W)*H=76.05, which was supposed to be 40. That's way higher

---------------

.

Hmm, not matching.

Option C)4m.

H=4. So L + W=5*4=20.

(L + W)*H=20 *4=80.

Which

---------------

 was supposed to be 40. So that's double. So that can't be right.

Wait, no, because

---------------

 in our equation, (L+W)*H =40. So if (L+W)*H=80, that would require

---------------

 2*(L + W)*H=160, but earlier we have 2*(L+W)*H=80.

So perhaps

---------------

 I made a mistake in the equation.

Wait, let me re-express.

Earlier, I thought 2*(L + W)*H -

---------------

15 =65 → 2*(L + W)*H=80 → (L + W)*H=40.

But wait

---------------

, maybe I got the equation wrong. Let me think again.

The paper area is 65 m², which equals the wall area minus 15.

So

---------------

, 65 = (2*(L + W)*H) -15 → 2*(L + W)*H =80 → (L + W)*H=40.

So

---------------

 if (L + W)*H=40, and (L + W)=5H, then substituting:

5H * H=40 →5H²=40 → H²=8 → H=2.828 m.

But

---------------

 none of the options match. So perhaps the mistake is in the way I calculated the paper area.

Wait, another approach: perhaps

---------------

 the paper's length is equal to the perimeter, and the width is 0.5m. So the paper area is perimeter * 0.5.



---------------

Wait, but paper is used to cover the walls, which have a height H and a perimeter of 2(L + W). So the

---------------

 total area is 2(L + W)*H.

Wait, but how much paper is used? The paper is 0.5m wide, so each

---------------

 strip covers 0.5m width and H meters height. So the length of paper needed per strip is H / 0.5,

---------------

 but wait, perhaps it's more complicated.

Alternatively, the total area to cover is 2*(L + W)*H.

---------------

 The paper is 0.5m wide and of length x meters, so the area is 0.5x. But

---------------

 since the paper has to cover the walls, perhaps the paper's area must be equal to the wall area minus the 15.



---------------

So, 0.5x = (2*(L + W)*H) -15 → x = [2*(L + W)*H -15 ] / 0.5 = 2*(2*(L + W)*H -15) → x

---------------

 =4*(L + W)*H -30.

The cost is x meters * Rs.2 per meter → 2x =260 → x=130.

So,

---------------

 4*(L + W)*H -30 =130 →4*(L + W)*H=160 → (L + W)*H=40.

Same as before. So,

---------------

 same equation.

So, (L + W)*H=40.

Hmm. Let's think about the options again. Maybe

---------------

 I made a mistake in the ratio.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is H:S=5:2, not 2:5. Let

---------------

 me recheck the problem statement.

No, the problem says "the height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5." So H:S=2:5,

---------------

 which I have correctly applied.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the area of the paper. Let me think about

---------------

 this again.

The paper is 50 cm wide, so each strip of paper is 0.5 m wide. To

---------------

 cover a wall of height H, how much paper do you need?

Each strip covers 0.5 m width and H meters height. So each

---------------

 strip has an area of 0.5 * H.

But the total area to cover is 2*(L + W)*H.

---------------

 So the number of strips needed is [2*(L + W)*H ] / (0.5 * H) )= 4*(L + W).

So

---------------

 the total length of paper needed is 4*(L + W) meters.

Wait, because each strip is 0.5m wide and H

---------------

 meters tall. So for each strip, you use H meters of paper. Because the paper is 0.5m wide, but

---------------

 you need to cover H meters height. Wait, perhaps each strip is H meters long.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently

---------------

. The area to cover is 2*(L + W)*H. The paper is 0.5m wide, so the

---------------

 length of paper needed is (2*(L + W)*H) / 0.5 =4*(L + W)*H.

So

---------------

 the cost is length * price per meter. So cost=4*(L + W)*H *2 Rs/m → 

---------------

8*(L + W)*H=260 → (L + W)*H=260/8=32.5.

Wait, earlier

---------------

 I thought (L + W)*H=40, but that was based on another approach. Now, this approach gives

---------------

 (L + W)*H=32.5.

Hmm, that's a different result. So which approach is correct?

Wait

---------------

, perhaps I should model it correctly. The paper's area is 0.5 m (width) multiplied by the length of

---------------

 the paper. So paper area=0.5 * x, where x is the length in meters.

The paper area must

---------------

 equal the wall area minus 15.

So 0.5x = (2*(L + W)*H) -15 → x=2*(2*(L + W)*H -15)

---------------

 =4*(L + W)*H -30.

The cost is x * 2 Rs/m → 2*(4*(L + W)*H -30) =260 → 8*(L + W)*H -60=260 →8*(L + W)*H=320 → (L + W)*H=40.

Which

---------------

 brings us back to the same equation. So the initial approach was correct.

So (L + W)*H=40.

And

---------------

 H = (L + W)/5 → substituting, (L + W) =5H.

So, 5H * H=40 →5 H²=40 →H²=8 →H=2√2≈2.828 m.

But

---------------

 the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem has a typo, or I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I forgot

---------------

 that the semi-perimeter is (L + W), not (L + W)/2.

Wait, no. Wait, semi

---------------

-perimeter is half the perimeter. Perimeter is 2*(L + W). So semi-perimeter is (L + W).

Wait, no

---------------

. Wait, semi-perimeter is (L + W)/2? No. Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait

---------------

, perimeter is 2(L + W). So semi-perimeter is (L + W).

Wait, no! Wait, no

---------------

. Wait, perimeter is 2(L + W). So semi-perimeter is (perimeter)/2 = (2(L + W))/2 = L + W.

Wait

---------------

, that changes everything! Oh! I think I made a mistake here.

So the semi-perimeter S = (L + W). Because S is perimeter

---------------

 /2, which is 2(L+W)/2 = L + W.

Wait, yes! That's the mistake. So

---------------

 S = L + W.

So the ratio H:S=2:5 → H/(L+W) = 2/5 → H = (2/5)(L+W).

So

---------------

 earlier, I thought S was (L + W)/2, which was wrong. Oh! That's a big mistake.

So,

---------------

 now let's correct that.

So, H = (2/5)(L + W).

So, (L + W) = (5/2) H.

Now

---------------

, from the wall area:

(L + W)*H =40 → (5/2 H ) * H =40 → (5/2) H²=40 → H²= (40 * 2)/5 → H²=16 → H=4 m.

Ah

---------------

! Now, 4 m is option C.

That makes sense. So the correct answer is C)4m.


The problem involves determining the height of a room given the following conditions:

1. **Height to Semi-Perimeter Ratio**: The height \( H \) of the room to its semi-perimeter \( S \) is given as \( 2:5 \). Since the semi-perimeter of a rectangular room is \( S = L + W \) (where \( L \) and \( W \) are the length and width of the room), the ratio can be expressed as:
   \[
   \frac{H}{S} = \frac{2}{5} \implies H = \frac{2}{5}(L + W).
   \]

2. **Wall Papering Cost**: The cost to paper the walls is Rs. 260, using paper that is 50 cm wide (0.5 m) at Rs. 2 per meter. Additionally, 15 sq.m is allowed for doors and windows. The total paper area used is:
   \[
   \text{Paper Area} = \text{Length of Paper} \times \text{Width of Paper}.
   \]
   The length of paper is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Length of Paper} = \frac{\text{Cost}}{\text{Price per Meter}} = \frac{260}{2} = 130 \, \text{m}.
   \]
   Thus, the paper area is:
   \[
   \text{Paper Area} = 130 \times 0.5 = 65 \, \text{m}^2.
   \]

3. **Wall Area Calculation**: The total wall area (excluding doors and windows) is given by:
   \[
   \text{Total Wall Area} = 2(L + W)H.
   \]
   Since the paper area is the total wall area minus the area for doors and windows:
   \[
   65 = 2(L + W)H - 15 \implies 2(L + W)H = 80 \implies (L + W)H = 40.
   \]

4. **Substituting the Height Ratio**: From the height-to-semi-perimeter ratio, \( H = \frac{2}{5}(L + W) \), we can express \( L + W \) as:
   \[
   L + W = \frac{5}{2}H.
   \]
   Substituting this into \( (L + W)H = 40 \):
   \[
   \left(\frac{5}{2}H\right)H = 40 \implies \frac{5}{2}H^2 = 40 \implies H^2 = 16 \implies H = 4 \, \text{m}.
   \]

Thus, the height of the room is **4 meters**, which corresponds to option **C**.
