Okay, so I've got this problem here about simple interest, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me read

---------------

 the question again.

Rahul borrowed Rs. 500 at 6% per annum simple interest. After 4 years, what amount will he pay to clear the debt? The options are A)750, B)700, C)620, D)600, E)None of these.

Hmm, right, simple interest. I remember that simple interest is calculated using the formula: I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P the principal amount, R the rate of interest per annum, and T the time in years.

So in

---------------

 this case, the principal P is 500 Rs. The rate R is 6%, which I should convert to a decimal, so 0.06. And the time T is 4 years.

Let me plug these into the formula. I = 500 * 0.06 * 4. Let me calculate that step by step. 500 multiplied by 0.06 is... 

---------------

30, right? Because 500 times 6% is 30. Then, 30 multiplied by 4 years is

---------------

 120. So the total interest is 120 Rs.

Wait, so the total amount he has to pay would be the principal plus the interest. So that's 500 + 120 = 620 Rs. Looking

---------------

 at the options, option C is 620. So that should be the answer, right?

But wait, let

---------------

 me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Did I use the correct formula? Yes, simple interest is P*R*T. Did

---------------

 I calculate each step correctly? 500 * 0.06 is 30, and 30 *4 is 120. So

---------------

 500 + 120 is 620. Yep, that's correct.

Looking at the options again: A is 750, which seems way too high. B is 700, also way

---------------

 off. C is 620, which matches my calculation. D is 600, which is 100 less than what I got

---------------

. So C is the right choice.

Wait, but wait a second. Sometimes, there's a confusion between simple interest and compound interest. But

---------------

 the question clearly states it's simple interest, so I didn't have to worry about compounding. So yeah, 620 is correct. So the answer is C.


To determine the total amount Rahul will pay to clear the debt after 4 years with 6% simple interest, we use the formula for simple interest:  
\[ I = P \times R \times T \]  
where \( P = 500 \), \( R = 0.06 \), and \( T = 4 \).  

First, calculate the interest:  
\[ I = 500 \times 0.06 \times 4 = 120 \, \text{Rs} \].  

The total amount to be paid is the sum of the principal and the interest:  
\[ \text{Total Amount} = P + I = 500 + 120 = 620 \, \text{Rs} \].  

Among the options, the correct amount is **620**, which corresponds to option **C**.
