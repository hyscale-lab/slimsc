Okay, so I've got this question here about simple interest. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the

---------------

 question says Rahul borrowed Rs. 500 at 6% per annum simple interest. I need to find out how much he'll pay after 4 years. The options are A to E, but I'll

---------------

 focus on the calculation first.

Wait, I remember that simple interest is calculated using the formula: I = P * R * T. Where P is principal, R is rate of interest, and T is time in years. So

---------------

 the interest each year is just 6% of 500. Let me compute that.

P is 500. R is 6%, which is 0.06 in decimal. T is 4 years. So I

---------------

 = 500 * 0.06 * 4. Let me calculate that. 500 multiplied by 0.06 is 30. Then, 30 multiplied by 4 is 120. So the total interest over four years is Rs. 120.

Now

---------------

, the total amount to pay back is the principal plus the interest. So 500 plus 120 is 620. Let

---------------

 me check the options. Option C is 620. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait

---------------

 a second. Did I remember the formula correctly? Oh right, simple interest is calculated only on the principal, not on the accumulated interest. So yeah

---------------

, each year it's 6% of 500, which is 30 per year. Over four years, that's 30*4=120. So total

---------------

 amount is 500+120=620. So the answer should be option C.

Looking at the options again: A is 750, which seems way too high. B is 700, also higher

---------------

 than our calculation. C is 620, which matches. D is 600, which would be if the interest was 100,

---------------

 but that's not the case here. So the only correct option is C.


To determine the total amount Rahul will pay to clear the debt after 4 years, we use the simple interest formula:

\[
I = P \times R \times T
\]

Where:
- \( P = 500 \) (principal amount),
- \( R = 6\% = 0.06 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( T = 4 \) years.

Substituting the values:

\[
I = 500 \times 0.06 \times 4 = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

The total interest over 4 years is Rs. 120. Adding this to the principal:

\[
\text{Total Amount} = P + I = 500 + 120 = 620
\]

Thus, Rahul will pay Rs. 620 to clear the debt. Among the options, the correct answer is:
