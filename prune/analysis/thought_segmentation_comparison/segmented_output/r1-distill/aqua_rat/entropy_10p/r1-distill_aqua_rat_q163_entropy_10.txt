Okay, so I've got this problem here about making identical bouquets with white and red tulips. Hmm, let me read it again carefully. The question says we

---------------

 have 28 white and 98 red tulips. We need to make as many identical bouquets as possible without leaving any flowers. Ident

---------------

ical means each bouquet has the same number of red and white tulips. So, the goal is to find the greatest number of bouquets possible.

Wait, right

---------------

. So each bouquet will have some white and some red tulips. And since all bouquets are identical, each one must have the same count of each color. So

---------------

, the total white and red tulips used must be multiples of the number of bouquets.

Let me think about how to approach this. I remember something about factors and greatest common divisors (GCD) from math class. Oh right, when you have two numbers and you want to split them into identical groups without leftovers, you find

---------------

 their GCD. Because the GCD is the largest number that can divide both quantities exactly.

So in this case, the two quantities are 28 white and 98 red. Let

---------------

 me find the GCD of 28 and 98. 

Breaking down 28: its prime factors are 2 * 2 * 7. 

---------------

98 is 2 * 49, which is 2 * 7 * 7. So the common factors are 2 and 7. Multiplying those together gives 14. So the GCD of 28 and 98 is 14.

Wait, but

---------------

 wait a second. Does that mean the maximum number of bouquets is 14? Because if each bouquet has 28/14=2 white tulips and 98/14=7 red tulips, that would

---------------

 use all the flowers exactly. So 14 bouquets each with 2 white and 7 red. That seems to fit the problem

---------------

's conditions.

But let me double-check. Because 28 divided by 14 is 2, and 98 divided by 14 is 7. Yes

---------------

, that's correct. So each bouquet would have 2 white and 7 red. That uses all the flowers without any leftovers.

Wait

---------------

, but looking at the options, option D is 14. So that's one of the choices. But wait, let

---------------

 me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Because sometimes, when dealing with two numbers, you might have to find the

---------------

 maximum number that divides both, which is the GCD. So yeah, 14 is the correct number of bouquets.

Wait

---------------

 another thing. What if I thought about it differently. Suppose I considered each bouquet as having 'w' white and 'r' red tulips. Then, the total white used

---------------

 would be w*b, and red would be r*b, where b is the number of bouquets. We need w*b=28 and r*b=98. So b must be a divisor of both 28 and 98. Hence, the maximum possible b is their GCD, which is 14.

Yes

---------------

, that makes sense. So the answer should be D)14.


To determine the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made from 28 white and 98 red tulips without leaving any flowers unused, we need to find the largest number of bouquets, \( b \), such that each bouquet has the same number of white and red tulips. This requires \( b \) to be a divisor of both 28 (the number of white tulips) and 98 (the number of red tulips).

The prime factorization of 28 is \( 2 \times 2 \times 7 \), and the prime factorization of 98 is \( 2 \times 7 \times 7 \). The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 28 and 98 is the product of the common prime factors, which is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \). Therefore, the maximum number of identical bouquets is 14.

Each bouquet will contain \( \frac{28}{14} = 2 \) white tulips and \( \frac{98}{14} = 7 \) red tulips. This ensures that all flowers are used without any leftovers, satisfying the problem's conditions.

Thus, the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made is **14**.
