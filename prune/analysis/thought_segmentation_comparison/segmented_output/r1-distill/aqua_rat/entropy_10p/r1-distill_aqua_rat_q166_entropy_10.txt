Okay, so I've got this problem here about two printers, Printer A and Printer B. Each can print half a page per second. The question is, how long will it take them to print 100 pages together? Hmm, let's break this down.

Wait, so each printer is

---------------

 printing 1/2 a page every second. That means in one second, Printer A does 0.5 pages, and same for Printer B. So together, how

---------------

 much do they do per second?

Let me think, if both are working at the same time, their rates should add up. So 

---------------

0.5 + 0.5 equals 1 page per second combined. Oh wait, that makes sense. Because in

---------------

 one second, A does 0.5, B does 0.5, so together they make a whole page.

So together

---------------

, their combined rate is 1 page per second. Now, the question is about printing 100 pages. If they're

---------------

 printing one page every second together, then for 100 pages, it would take 100 seconds. Because

---------------

 100 pages divided by 1 page per second is 100 seconds.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Sometimes

---------------

 when dealing with rates, it's easy to mix up the addition. Let me double-check. Each printer's rate is 0.5 pages/s. So together

---------------

, their combined rate is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 page/s. So yes, that's correct.

So the

---------------

 time taken would be total pages divided by the combined rate. So 100 pages / 1 page per second = 100 seconds. Looking at the options, option C is 100 seconds. So the answer should be C.

Another

---------------

 way to think about it: In one second, together they print 1 page. So for 100 pages, 

---------------

100 seconds. Yep, that's straightforward.


Printer A and Printer B each print at a rate of 0.5 pages per second. When working together, their combined printing rate is the sum of their individual rates:  
\[
0.5 \, \text{pages/second} + 0.5 \, \text{pages/second} = 1 \, \text{page/second}.
\]  
To print 100 pages at a combined rate of 1 page per second, the time required is:  
\[
\frac{100 \, \text{pages}}{1 \, \text{page/second}} = 100 \, \text{seconds}.
\]  
Thus, the correct answer is **C) 100 seconds**.
