Okay, so I have this problem about two printers, Printer A and Printer B. Each of them can print half a page per second. The question is asking how long it will take both working together to print 100 pages. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, both

---------------

 printers are identical. So each can do 0.5 pages per second. If they work together, their rates should add up, right? So

---------------

 I need to find their combined printing rate first.

Let me calculate that. Printer A's rate is 0.5 pages/sec, and Printer B's is the same. So together, their

---------------

 combined rate is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 page per second. Oh, that's neat. So together, they print one page every second.

Now, the problem

---------------

 is to print 100 pages. If they can do 1 page every second together, then for 100 pages, it should take 100 seconds, right? Because 100 pages divided by 1 page per second equals 100 seconds.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Each

---------------

 printer does half a page a second. So in one second, Printer A does 0.5, Printer B does 0.5. Together, that's 1 page per

---------------

 second. So for 100 pages, yeah, 100 seconds. So the answer should be option C, which is 100 seconds.

But

---------------

 wait, looking at the options, option C is 100. So that's the one. Let me make sure I didn't make

---------------

 a mistake. Another way to think about it: how much does each printer contribute. If they work for 't' seconds, Printer

---------------

 A does 0.5 * t pages, Printer B does 0.5 * t pages. Together, 0.5t + 0.5t = t pages. So t

---------------

 = 100. So yeah, that's correct. So the answer is C.


To determine how long it will take for Printer A and Printer B to print 100 pages together, we first calculate their combined printing rate. Each printer prints at a rate of \( 0.5 \, \text{pages per second} \). When working together, their rates add up:

\[
\text{Combined rate} = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 \, \text{page per second}.
\]

This means the two printers together can print 1 page every second. To print 100 pages, the time required is:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Combined rate}} = \frac{100}{1} = 100 \, \text{seconds}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **C) 100 seconds**.
