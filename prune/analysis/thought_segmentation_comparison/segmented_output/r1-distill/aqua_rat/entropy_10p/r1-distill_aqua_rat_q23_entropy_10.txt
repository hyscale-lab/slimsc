Okay, let's see. I have this problem where I need to find the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students in a class, given some fractions. The total number is a four-digit number. Hmm.

So, the problem states that 1/16 study math, 1/10 study bio, and 1/8 study English. Wait

---------------

, but wait a minute—those fractions might not be the only students. Or do they? The question doesn't specify whether these are the only students or if there are overlaps. Oh, wait

---------------

, the question is about the number of students studying each subject, but I think it's more about the total number of students being

---------------

 a four-digit number that's a multiple of the denominators of these fractions because the number of students in each subject has to be an integer.

Oh

---------------

 right! So, the total number of students, let's call it N, must be such that N is divisible by 16, 10, and 8. Because 

---------------

1/16 of them must be an integer, same for 1/10 and 1/8.

So N

---------------

 has to be a common multiple of 16, 10, and 8. To find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers,

---------------

 right?

Let me break them down into their prime factors.

16 is 2^4.
10 is 2 * 5.
8 is 2^3.

The LCM would take the highest power of each prime. So for 2, the highest power is 4 (from 16). For 5, it's 5^1 (from 10). So LCM = 2^4 *5 = 16*5=80.

So N must be a multiple of 80. But

---------------

 N is a four-digit number. So the smallest four-digit number divisible by 80 is the smallest N ≥1000,

---------------

 and the largest is the largest N ≤9999.

Wait, let's find the minimum possible N. The smallest four-digit number is 1000. But

---------------

 is 1000 divisible by 80? Let me check: 1000 divided by 80 is 12.5. Oh

---------------

 no, not an integer. So the next multiple would be 80 *13 = 1040. Because

---------------

 12*80=960, which is three-digit. So the minimum N is 1040.

Now

---------------

 the maximum four-digit N divisible by 80. The largest four-digit number is 9999. Let's see what

---------------

's the largest multiple of 80 less than or equal to 9999. 9999 divided by 80 is 

---------------

124.9875. So the integer part is 124, so 124*80=9920. So

---------------

 the maximum N is 9920.

Wait, wait. But wait, 80 *125 is 10,000, which is a five-digit number. So yes, 9920 is the maximum.

Now, the problem

---------------

 asks for the difference between the maximum and minimum N. So 9920 - 1040 = ?

Let me calculate that: 9920 -1040. Hmm

---------------

, 9920 minus 1000 is 8920, then plus 40 (

---------------

since it's minus 1040, which is 1000+40). Wait, no, 

---------------

9920 -1040 = 9920 - (1000 +40) = (9920-1000) -40 = 8920 -40 = 8880.

Wait, so

---------------

 the difference is 8880.

Looking at the options, option A is 8880.

But wait, let

---------------

 me double-check if I did everything correctly. Because sometimes I might have missed something.

Wait, the question is about the difference

---------------

 between maximum and minimum number of students, right? So N is the total, which must be a multiple of 80, four

---------------

 digits. So min N is 1040, max N is 9920. Difference is 8880.

So

---------------

 the correct answer is option A: 8880.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students in a class, given that the total number of students is a four-digit number and satisfies the conditions:

1. \( \frac{1}{16} \) of the students study math.
2. \( \frac{1}{10} \) of the students study bio.
3. \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the students study English.

For the number of students in each subject to be an integer, the total number of students \( N \) must be divisible by the denominators of the given fractions, i.e., 16, 10, and 8. The least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers is calculated as follows:

- Prime factorization:
  - \( 16 = 2^4 \),
  - \( 10 = 2 \cdot 5 \),
  - \( 8 = 2^3 \).
- The LCM is obtained by taking the highest power of each prime:
  - \( \text{LCM} = 2^4 \cdot 5 = 16 \cdot 5 = 80 \).

Thus, \( N \) must be a multiple of 80. Since \( N \) is a four-digit number, we find the smallest and largest four-digit multiples of 80:

- The smallest four-digit multiple of 80 is \( 1040 \) (since \( 80 \times 13 = 1040 \)).
- The largest four-digit multiple of 80 is \( 9920 \) (since \( 80 \times 124 = 9920 \)).

The difference between the maximum and minimum values of \( N \) is:

\[
9920 - 1040 = 8880
\]

Thus, the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is **8880**.
