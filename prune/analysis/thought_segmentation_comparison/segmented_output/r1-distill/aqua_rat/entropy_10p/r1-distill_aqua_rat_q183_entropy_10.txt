Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to

---------------

 make sure I understand.

The problem says: "A number is as much greater than 36 as it is less than 86. Find the number." Hmm, okay

---------------

. So, I need to find a number that has an equal difference above 36 and below 86. Wait

---------------

, does that mean the number is exactly in the middle between 36 and 86? Because if the number is greater

---------------

 than 36 by the same amount it's less than 86, then it should be the midpoint of those two numbers.

Let me think. The

---------------

 midpoint between two numbers is calculated by adding them together and dividing by two. So, 36 plus 86 equals

---------------

... let me calculate that. 36 plus 80 is 116, plus 6 is 122. So 36 +86 is 122. Then,

---------------

 dividing that by 2 gives me 61. Oh, so the number should be 61. Let me check the options.

---------------

 Option D is 61. So that's probably the answer.

Wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly. The number

---------------

 is greater than 36 by the same amount it's less than 86. So, if the number is X, then X -36 equals 86 - X. Oh

---------------

, right, because the difference above 36 is the same as the difference below 86.

So, solving for X: X -36 = 86 - X. Let's bring

---------------

 like terms together. I'll add X to both sides, which gives me 2X -36 = 86. Then add 36 to both sides: 2X = 86 +36. 86 plus 30 is 116, plus 6 is 122. So 2X=122, which

---------------

 means X=61. Yep, that's the same as before. So the number is 61, which is option D.

I

---------------

 think I've got it right. The midpoint makes sense because the differences on both sides are equal. So yeah, D is the correct answer.


The problem states that a number is as much greater than 36 as it is less than 86. This means the number is equidistant from 36 and 86. To find this number, we calculate the midpoint between 36 and 86. The midpoint is given by:

\[
\text{Midpoint} = \frac{36 + 86}{2} = \frac{122}{2} = 61
\]

To verify, let the number be \( X \). According to the problem, \( X - 36 = 86 - X \). Solving this:

\[
X - 36 = 86 - X
\]
\[
2X = 122
\]
\[
X = 61
\]

Thus, the number is 61, which corresponds to option D.
