Okay, so I need to figure out the final concentration of tea in John's drink. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem step by step. 

John starts with a 50% strong milk tea. So

---------------

 that means initially, half of the volume is tea, and the other half is milk, I suppose. Then he does some replacements with milk, and I need to calculate how that affects the concentration.

First step: He replaces 15% of it with milk twice. Wait, does

---------------

 that mean he adds 15% milk each time, or replaces 15% of the solution with milk? I

---------------

 think it's the latter. So he takes 15% of the current solution and replaces it with milk. But wait, when

---------------

 you replace a portion of the solution, you're removing that fraction and adding the same amount of milk. So each time he does this, the concentration of tea decreases.

Let me model

---------------

 this. Let's say the initial volume is V. But since we're dealing with concentrations, the actual volume might not matter because

---------------

 we can work with fractions.

Initial concentration: 50% tea. So tea is 0.5, milk is 0.5.

First replacement: he replaces 15% of the solution with milk. So 

---------------

15% is 0.15. So he takes out 15% of the solution and replaces it with milk. Since

---------------

 the solution is 50% tea, when he removes 15% of it, he's removing 15% * 0.5 tea and 15% * 0.5 milk. Then

---------------

 he adds back 15% milk.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The solution is 50% tea, 50% milk. So when

---------------

 he removes 15% of the solution, he's removing 15% of the total. The removed part has 50% tea and 50% milk. Then he adds back 15% milk. So the net

---------------

 effect is that the amount of tea decreases, and milk increases.

Let me calculate the tea concentration after first replacement.

Let me denote

---------------

 the concentration of tea after each step.

After first replacement:

The initial concentration is C0 = 50% = 0.5.

He replaces 15% (so

---------------

 0.15 fraction) of the solution with milk. So the remaining tea is (1 - 0.15) * C0.



---------------

Because he removes 15% of the solution, which has C0 concentration of tea, so the tea left is (1 - 0.15) * C0. Then he adds milk, which doesn't contain tea, so the new concentration is (0.85) * C0.

So after first replacement: C1 = 0.85 * 0.5 = 0.425, which is 42.5%.

Wait, but he does this twice. So the

---------------

 first time, it goes to 42.5%. Then he does it again.

So after second replacement: C2 = 0.85 * C1 = 0.85 * 0.425.

Let me compute that. 0.85 * 0.425.

---------------

 Hmm, 0.425 * 0.85. Let's compute:

0.4 * 0.85 = 0.34.



---------------

0.025 * 0.85 = 0.02125.

So 0.34 + 0.02125 = 0.36125. So 36.125% tea concentration after two replacements.

Wait, but

---------------

 wait. The problem says he replaces 15% twice. So each time, it's 15% of the current solution. But

---------------

 since each time the volume is the same, perhaps it's the same as replacing 15% each time. So after

---------------

 the first replacement, it's 42.5%, then again 15% of the new solution (which is 42.5%) is replaced.

Wait

---------------

, but when you replace a fraction of the solution, the formula is (remaining fraction) multiplied by the current concentration.

So the

---------------

 first time: 15% replaced, so 85% remains. So 0.85 * 0.5 = 0.425.

Second time: same thing

---------------

. 0.85 * 0.425 = 0.36125.

So after two replacements, the tea is 36.125%.

Then, the next step: he replaces 10% of the resultant solution with more milk.

So now

---------------

, the current tea concentration is 36.125% (C2). He replaces 10% of this solution with milk. So again

---------------

, he removes 10% of the solution, which has 36.125% tea, and adds 10% milk.

So the new concentration after

---------------

 this third replacement would be (1 - 0.10) * C2.

So C3 = 0.90 * 0.36125.

Let me calculate that: 0.9 * 0.36125.

0.3 * 0.36125 = 0.108375.

0.6 * 0.36125 = 0.21675.

Wait, no. Wait, 0.9 is 0.9,

---------------

 so 0.36125 * 0.9.

Another way: 36125 * 0.9 = 32512.5.



---------------

Wait, 0.36125 * 0.9 = 0.325125, so approximately 32.5125% tea.

Looking at the options, option E is 32.51%, which matches this.



---------------

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.

Let me recompute

---------------

:

First step: 50% tea.

After first replacement: 0.85 * 0.5 = 0.425 → 42.5%.

Second replacement: 0.85 * 0.425.

Let

---------------

 me compute 0.425 * 0.85:

0.425 * 0.8 = 0.34.



---------------

0.425 * 0.05 = 0.02125.

Adding them gives 0.36125 → 36.125%.

Third replacement: 10% replaced, so 90% remains.

0.36125 * 0.9 = 0.325125 → 32.5125%.

Which is approximately 32.51%, so option E.

But

---------------

 wait, let me think again about the process. When you replace 15% with milk, do you add 15% or

---------------

 remove 15% and add 15% milk?

Wait, the problem says "replaces 15% of it with milk". So for

---------------

 example, taking 15% of the current solution and replacing it with milk. So it's 15% removed

---------------

 and 15% added as milk. So the total volume remains the same each time.

So each replacement step is a

---------------

 dilution, reducing the concentration by a factor of (1 - 0.15) each time.

So initial concentration

---------------

 C0 = 0.5.

After first replacement: C1 = C0 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.5 * 0.85 = 0.425.

Second replacement: C2 = C1 * 0.85 = 0.425 * 0.85 = 0.36125.

Then, the

---------------

 third step is replacing 10% of the current solution with milk. So factor is (1 - 0.10) = 0.90.

C3 = 0.36125 * 0.90 = 0.325125 → 32.5125%, which rounds to 32.51%, option E.

Alternatively

---------------

, perhaps I should model each step more carefully.

Let me model it with actual volumes to see if the same result holds.

Let's say the initial volume is 100ml for simplicity.

Initial:

---------------

 50ml tea, 50ml milk.

First replacement: 15ml replaced with milk.

The 15ml is taken from the initial 100ml, which is 50% tea. So the 15ml has 7.5ml tea and 7.5ml milk.

After removing, the remaining solution is 85ml.

---------------

 Which has 50 -7.5=42.5ml tea and 50 -7.5=42.5ml milk. Then adding

---------------

 15ml milk: total milk becomes 42.5 +15=57.5ml, tea remains 42.5ml. So concentration

---------------

 is 42.5/100 = 42.5% tea.

Second replacement: 15ml replaced with milk.

The

---------------

 current solution is 42.5ml tea and 57.5ml milk.

The 15ml taken out has (42.5/100)*15 = 6.375ml tea, and 57.5/100 *15 = 8.625ml milk.

So after removing, the remaining solution is 85ml,

---------------

 with 42.5 -6.375=36.125ml tea, and 57.5 -8.625=48.875ml milk. Then adding 15ml milk: 48.875 +15=63.875ml milk. So tea is 36.125ml in 100ml.

---------------

 So 36.125% tea.

Third replacement: 10ml replaced with milk.

Current solution: 36.125ml tea, 63.875ml milk.

1

---------------

0ml removed: 36.125/100 *10 = 3.6125ml tea removed. Milk removed: 63.875/100 *10=6.3875ml.

Remaining solution: 36.125-3.6125=32.5125ml tea, and 63.875-6.3875=57.4875ml milk. Then add 10ml milk: 57.4875 +10=67.4875ml milk. So total solution

---------------

 is 100ml.

Tea concentration is 32.5125/100 = 32.5125%, which matches the

---------------

 earlier calculation.

So the correct answer is E) 32.51%.


John starts with a 50% tea solution. He performs three replacement steps with milk, each reducing the tea concentration. 

1. **First Replacement (15% replaced):**  
   The initial concentration is \( C_0 = 0.5 \). Replacing 15% of the solution means 85% of the tea remains.  
   \[
   C_1 = 0.85 \times 0.5 = 0.425 \, (42.5\% \, \text{tea}).
   \]

2. **Second Replacement (15% replaced):**  
   The new concentration is \( C_1 = 0.425 \). Again, 85% of the tea remains.  
   \[
   C_2 = 0.85 \times 0.425 = 0.36125 \, (36.125\% \, \text{tea}).
   \]

3. **Third Replacement (10% replaced):**  
   The new concentration is \( C_2 = 0.36125 \). Replacing 10% means 90% of the tea remains.  
   \[
   C_3 = 0.90 \times 0.36125 = 0.325125 \, (32.5125\% \, \text{tea}).
   \]

After all three steps, the final tea concentration is approximately \( 32.51\% \). Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:
