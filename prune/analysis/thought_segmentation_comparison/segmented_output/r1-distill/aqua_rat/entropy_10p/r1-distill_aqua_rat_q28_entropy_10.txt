Okay, so I've got this problem here about a jeep traveling a certain distance. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says: A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12 km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance traveled by the jeep?

Wait

---------------

, so the distance is the same in both directions, right? Because it's going somewhere and coming back. So the forward and return journeys are the same distance but different speeds and times.

I

---------------

 remember that distance equals speed multiplied by time. So, maybe I can set up two equations here. Let me think.

Let's denote the speed during the forward journey as 'v' km/hr. Then, the time taken is 6 hours. So the distance (

---------------

D) would be v * 6. 

On the return trip, the speed increased by 12 km/hr. So the new speed is v + 12. The time taken for the return is 4 hours. So the distance here

---------------

 is (v + 12) * 4.

But since the distance is the same for both trips, I can set these two expressions equal to each other. So:

v * 6 = (v + 12) * 4.

Oh

---------------

, okay, so now I can solve for v. Let me expand that equation.

6v = 4(v + 12)

Let

---------------

 me distribute the 4 on the right side:

6v = 4v + 48

Now, subtract 4v from both sides to get:

2v = 48

Divide both sides by 2:

v = 24 km/hr.

So the speed during the forward journey was 24 km/hr. Now, the

---------------

 distance D would be speed multiplied by time, which is 24 * 6. Let me calculate that.

24 * 6 is 144. So the distance is 144 km.

Looking at the options, option B is 144 km. So the answer should be B.

Wait, let

---------------

 me double-check. For the return trip, the speed is 24 +12 =36 km/hr. Time is 4 hours, so distance is 36 *4=144 km. Yep, same as before. So that

---------------

 makes sense.

I think that's correct. So the distance is 144 km.


To solve the problem, we denote the speed during the forward journey as \( v \) km/hr. The distance traveled in the forward journey is \( D = v \cdot 6 \). On the return journey, the speed increases by 12 km/hr, making the new speed \( v + 12 \). The time taken for the return journey is 4 hours, so the distance is \( D = (v + 12) \cdot 4 \). Since the distance is the same for both journeys, we equate the two expressions:

\[
v \cdot 6 = (v + 12) \cdot 4
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
6v = 4v + 48
\]

Subtracting \( 4v \) from both sides:

\[
2v = 48
\]

Dividing by 2:

\[
v = 24 \, \text{km/hr}
\]

The speed during the forward journey is 24 km/hr. The distance \( D \) is then:

\[
D = v \cdot 6 = 24 \cdot 6 = 144 \, \text{km}
\]

For

---------------

 verification, the return speed is \( 24 + 12 = 36 \, \text{km/hr} \), and the distance is:

\[
D = 36 \cdot 4 = 144 \, \text{km}
\]

Both calculations confirm the distance is 144 km. Thus

---------------

, the correct answer is:
