Okay, so I've got this problem here about chocolates in a store, and I'm supposed to figure out what percentage are both vanilla and not squashed. Let's see... I

---------------

'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question says all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored only. So, that

---------------

 means every chocolate is vanilla or cocoa, no other options. Got it.

It says 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored. Wait, so if 10% are cocoa, then the rest must be vanilla. Because all

---------------

 are either vanilla or cocoa. So vanilla would be 100% minus 10%, which is 90%. So

---------------

 90% are vanilla.

But then it says 90% of the rest are squashed. Hmm, wait

---------------

, what's the "rest" referring to here? Let me parse that again. Oh, maybe the rest after considering the cocoa.

---------------

 So the rest would be the vanilla ones. So 90% of the vanilla chocolates are squashed.

Wait, that

---------------

 can't be right. Let me think again. The first part: 10% are cocoa, so 90% are vanilla. Then, 90% of the rest (the

---------------

 vanilla) are squashed. So, 90% of 90% are squashed.

Wait, but wait

---------------

. So the vanilla chocolates are 90% of the total. Out of those, 90% are squashed. So the percentage

---------------

 of vanilla and squashed would be 90% * 90% = 81% of the total chocolates. But

---------------

 the question is asking for vanilla and not squashed. So that's the opposite.

So if 90% of vanilla are squashed, then 10% of vanilla are not squashed. So 

---------------

10% of 90% is 9% of the total.

Wait, wait. Let me think. Let

---------------

's model this with numbers to make it clearer. Let's assume there are 100 chocolates in total for simplicity.

Total chocolates = 100.

Cocoa flavored = 10% of 100 = 10 chocolates.

So vanilla flavored = 100 - 10 = 90 chocolates.

Now, 90% of the rest (which are the vanilla) are squashed. Wait, so

---------------

 90% of the vanilla are squashed. So 90% of 90 is 81. So 81 vanilla chocolates are squashed. So

---------------

 the remaining vanilla ones (not squashed) would be 90 - 81 = 9.

So 9 out of 100 chocolates are vanilla and not squashed. So that's 9%.

Looking at the options, option D is 9%, so that's the answer.

Wait, let me double

---------------

-check. Another way to think: the problem says 90% of the rest are squashed. The rest after cocoa

---------------

 is vanilla, so 90% of vanilla are squashed. So squashed vanilla is 81%, as above

---------------

. So not squashed is 9% of total.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is D)9%.


To determine the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed, we analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Total Chocolates**: Assume there are 100 chocolates for simplicity.

2. **Cocoa Flavored**: 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored.  
   \[
   \text{Cocoa flavored} = 10\% \times 100 = 10 \text{ chocolates}.
   \]

3. **Vanilla Flavored**: Since all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa, the remaining 90% are vanilla flavored.  
   \[
   \text{Vanilla flavored} = 100 - 10 = 90 \text{ chocolates}.
   \]

4. **Squashed Chocolates**: 90% of the vanilla flavored chocolates are squashed.  
   \[
   \text{Squashed vanilla} = 90\% \times 90 = 81 \text{ chocolates}.
   \]

5. **Not Squashed Vanilla**: The remaining vanilla chocolates are not squashed.  
   \[
   \text{Not squashed vanilla} = 90 - 81 = 9 \text{ chocolates}.
   \]

6. **Percentage of Not Squashed Vanilla**:  
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \frac{9}{100} \times 100 = 9\%.
   \]

Thus, 9% of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed.
