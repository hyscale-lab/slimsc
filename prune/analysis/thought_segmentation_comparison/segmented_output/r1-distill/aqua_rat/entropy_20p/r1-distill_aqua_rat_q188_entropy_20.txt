Okay, so I've got this problem here about ten lime soda bottles and dividing them into two groups of five each. The

---------------

 question is asking how many ways there are to create these two groups. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

Wait

---------------

, so the setup is that there are ten bottles, and we need to split them into two groups, each with five members

---------------

. And these groups are for two different sets of customers. But wait, are the groups labeled or not? Like, does it matter which group is which,

---------------

 or are they just two groups without any distinction?

I remember that when you split a set into two groups, if the groups are considered

---------------

 the same (like indistinct), you have to divide by 2 to account for the duplication. Because choosing group A and group B is the same as group B and group A.

---------------

 But if the groups are distinct, like labeled as group 1 and group 2, then you don't divide by 2.

In this problem, the groups

---------------

 are going to different sets of customers. So I think that makes them distinct. So, for example, group 1 is

---------------

 served to the first five customers, and group 2 to the other five. So the order matters, so we don't divide

---------------

 by 2.

So the problem becomes, how many ways to choose 5 bottles out of 10 for group 1, and the remaining 5 automatically go to group 2. So

---------------

 that would be the combination of 10 choose 5.

The formula for combinations is n choose k = n!/(k! (n-k)!).

---------------

 So 10 choose 5 would be 10!/(5!5!) = let me calculate that.

Wait

---------------

, 10! is 3628800. 5! is 120, so 

---------------

5!5! is 120*120=14400. So 3628800 divided by 14400.

---------------

 Let me do that division. 3628800 / 14400.

Hmm, 

---------------

14400 times 250 is 3,600,000, which is a

---------------

 bit more than 3,628,800. Wait, maybe I should simplify the fraction before multiplying out

---------------

.

10! = 10×9×8×7×6×5! So 10×9×8×7×6 =

---------------

 30240. Then divided by (5!5!) which is 120×120.

---------------

 So 30240 / (14400) = 2.1? Wait, no, that

---------------

 can't be right. Wait, 30240 divided by 14400: 14400 *

---------------

 2 = 28800. 30240 - 28800 = 1440. So that's 2 and

---------------

 1440/14400 = 0.1. So 2.1? That can

---------------

't be right because 10 choose 5 is a well-known number. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake in the

---------------

 calculation.

Wait, 10 choose 5 is 252. Because I remember that 10 choose 5 is 252. So

---------------

 252 ways. So the number is 252.

Looking at the options, option D is 252. So that

---------------

 should be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. If the groups were indistinct, then it would be 10 choose 5 divided by 2, which would be 126. But

---------------

 since the groups are serving different customers, they're distinct. So no division by 2, so 252 is

---------------

 correct.


To determine the number of ways to divide ten lime soda bottles into two groups of five each for two distinct sets of customers, we need

---------------

 to calculate the number of ways to choose 5 bottles out of 10 for the first group. The remaining 5 bottles will automatically form the second group. Since the groups are distinct (they serve different sets of customers), we do not need to divide by 2 to account for duplication.

The number of ways to choose 5 bottles out of 10 is given by the combination formula:

\[
\binom{10}{5} = \frac{10!}{5! \cdot 5!}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
10! = 3,628,800, \quad 5! = 120, \quad \text{so } 5! \cdot 5! = 120 \cdot 120 = 14,400
\]

\[
\binom{10}{5} = \frac{3,628,800}{14,400} = 252
\]

Thus, there are 252 ways to create the two groups. Since the groups are distinct, no

---------------

 further adjustments are needed. The correct answer is:
