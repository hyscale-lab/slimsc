Okay, so I've got this problem here about making identical bouquets with white and red tulips. Hmm, let me think

---------------

. The question says there are 28 white and 98 red tulips. We need to make as many identical bouquets as possible without leaving any flowers out. Ident

---------------

ical means each bouquet has the same number of white and red tulips.

So, the key here is that both the white and red tulips have

---------------

 to be divided evenly into the bouquets. That sounds like a problem involving factors and maybe the greatest common divisor, or GCD. Oh

---------------

 right, because the GCD would tell me the largest number that can divide both quantities evenly.

Let me write down the numbers: 28 white and 98 red. I

---------------

 need to find the GCD of 28 and 98. How do I do that? Well, one way is to list out the factors of each number and find the largest common one.

Factors

---------------

 of 28: Let's see, 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28. Those

---------------

 are all the numbers that divide into 28 without a remainder.

Factors of 98: Let me think. 1, 2, 7, 14, 49, 98. Wait

---------------

, 49 times 2 is 98, right.

So the common factors are 1, 2, 7, 14. Oh

---------------

, the largest is 14. So that would mean the greatest number of bouquets is 14. But wait, let

---------------

 me double-check because sometimes I might miss something.

Wait, but if the GCD is 14, each bouquet would have 28 divided by 14,

---------------

 which is 2 white tulips per bouquet. And 98 divided by 14 is 7 red per bouquet. So

---------------

 each bouquet has 2 white and 7 red. That makes sense.

But wait, the options include 14 as option

---------------

 D, so that's a possible answer. But let me think again. Maybe I should make sure that I'm not missing

---------------

 a higher number. What's the total number of bouquets possible? The maximum possible bouquets can't be more than the smaller

---------------

 quantity divided by something, but in this case, it's the GCD that determines it.

Another way to compute GCD is using the Euclidean algorithm. Let's try

---------------

 that. So, 98 divided by 28: 28 times 3 is 84, remainder

---------------

 is 14. Now, take 28 divided by 14, which is 2 with remainder 0. So the GCD is 14. Yep, that's

---------------

 correct.

So the greatest number of identical bouquets is 14. Looking at the options, D is 14. So the

---------------

 answer should be D.


To determine the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made from 28 white and 98 red tulips without leaving any flowers out, we need to find the largest number that divides both quantities evenly. This is equivalent

---------------

 to finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 28 and 98.

First, list the factors of each number:
- Factors of 28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28
- Factors of 98: 1, 2, 7, 14, 49, 98

The common factors are 1, 2, 7, and 14. The largest of these is 14. Therefore

---------------

, the GCD of 28 and 98 is 14.

This means that the greatest number of identical bouquets is 14, with each bouquet containing:
- \( \frac{28}{14} = 2 \) white tulips
- \( \frac{98}{14} = 7 \) red tulips

Thus, the answer is **14**, which corresponds to option D.
