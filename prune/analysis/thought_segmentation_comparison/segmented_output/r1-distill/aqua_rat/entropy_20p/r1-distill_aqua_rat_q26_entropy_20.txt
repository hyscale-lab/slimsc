Okay, so I've got this question here about simple interest. Hmm, I remember that simple interest is calculated using the formula I = P * R * T, right? Where

---------------

 I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest per annum, and T is the time in years.

The

---------------

 question says Rahul borrowed Rs. 500 at 6% per annum simple interest for 4 years. I need to find out how much he'll pay to clear the debt after 4 years. So

---------------

, I think the total amount he'll pay is the principal plus the interest.

Let me break it down. The principal P

---------------

 is 500. The rate R is 6% per year. Wait, percentage, so I should convert that to a decimal. 6% is 0.06. Time T is 4 years.

So

---------------

 first, calculate the interest. I = P*R*T = 500 * 0.06 *4. Let me compute that. 500 * 0.06 is 30, and

---------------

 30 multiplied by 4 is 120. So the interest is 120 rupees.

Then

---------------

 the total amount to pay back is principal plus interest. So 500 + 120 equals 620. Looking

---------------

 at the options, option C is 620. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double

---------------

-check my calculations to be sure. 500 multiplied by 0.06 is indeed 30. And

---------------

 30 times 4 is 120. Yeah, that's right. So adding that to the principal gives

---------------

 620. So the answer should be option C.


To determine the total amount Rahul will pay to clear the debt, we use the simple interest formula:

\[
I = P \times R \times T
\]

Where:
- \( P = 500 \) (principal amount),
- \( R = 6\% = 0.06 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( T = 4 \) years (time).

First, calculate the interest:
\[
I = 500 \times 0.06 \times 4 = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

The total amount to be paid back is the sum of the principal and the interest:
\[
\text{Total Amount} = P + I = 500 + 120 = 620
\]

Thus, Rahul will pay Rs. 620 to clear the debt. The correct option is:
