Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully

---------------

.

The question says that events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. I need to find the probability that event B occurs. The options are A) 0.5, B) 0.6, C) 0.7, D) 0.8, E) 0.9.

Hmm. I

---------------

 remember that when two events are independent, the probability of both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. So P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). But

---------------

 wait, the problem here is about the probability that at least one occurs. Oh right, the formula for that is P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Since

---------------

 they are independent, P(A and B) is P(A)*P(B).

Let me write down what I know. P(A) is 0.6, and P(A or B) is 0.96. So

---------------

 substituting into the formula:

0.96 = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)*P(B)

Pl

---------------

ugging in P(A) = 0.6:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B))

Let

---------------

 me compute that. Let's see, 0.6 * P(B) is 0.6P(B), so the

---------------

 equation becomes:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)

Wait

---------------

, I can factor P(B) terms. So P(B) - 0.6P(B) is 0.4P(B). So the

---------------

 equation is:

0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)

Now, subtract 0.6 from both sides:



---------------

0.96 - 0.6 = 0.4P(B)

0.36 = 0.4P(B)

To

---------------

 find P(B), I can divide both sides by 0.4:

P(B) = 0.36 / 0.4 = 0.9?



---------------

Wait, wait. Let me check that calculation again. 0.36 divided by 0.4. Hmm, 0.36 divided

---------------

 by 0.4 is the same as 36/40, which simplifies to 0.9. So

---------------

 P(B) is 0.9? But looking at the options, E is 0.9. So is that the answer? But

---------------

 wait, let me think again. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, let me go through the steps again to be

---------------

 sure.

The formula for P(A or B) is P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B).

---------------

 So:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B)).

S

---------------

implify the right-hand side: 0.6 + (1 - 0.6) P(B) = 0.6 + 0.4 P(B).

So 

---------------

0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4 P(B). Subtract 0.6: 0.36 = 0.4 P(B). Divide

---------------

 both sides by 0.4: P(B) = 0.9.

So that seems right. So the probability that event B occurs is 0.9, which is option E.

Wait, but wait

---------------

 a second. I'm a bit confused because 0.9 is a pretty high probability, and A is 0.6. Let

---------------

 me think if that makes sense.

If both A and B are high probability events, then P(A or B) being 0.96 is

---------------

 plausible. Let me calculate P(A or B) with P(B)=0.9.

P(A or B) = 0.6 + 0.9 - (0.6*0.9) = 1.5 - 0.54 = 0.96. Yes

---------------

, that's correct. So the answer should be E) 0.9.

Wait, but another thought: I've

---------------

 heard sometimes that if events are independent, knowing one doesn't affect the other, but in this case, since both are high

---------------

 probabilities, their combination gives a high union probability. So yeah, the calculation seems correct.


The problem involves two independent events, \( A \) and \( B \), with \( P(A) = 0.6 \) and \( P(A \text{ or } B) = 0.96 \). The goal is to find \( P(B) \).

Since

---------------

 \( A \) and \( B \) are independent, the formula for the probability of at least one event occurring is:

\[
P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B)
\]

Substituting the known values \( P(A) = 0.6 \) and \( P(A \text{ or } B) = 0.96 \):

\[
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 \cdot P(B))
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
\]

Factor out \( P(B) \):

\[
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)
\]

Subtract \( 0.6 \) from both sides:

\[
0.36 = 0.4P(B)
\]

Divide through by \( 0.4 \):

\[
P(B) = \frac{0.36}{0.4} = 0.9
\]

Thus, the probability that event \( B \) occurs is \( 0.9 \), which corresponds to option **E**.
