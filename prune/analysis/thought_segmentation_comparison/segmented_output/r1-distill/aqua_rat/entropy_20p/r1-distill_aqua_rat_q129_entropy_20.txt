Okay, so I have this problem here about an astronaut's weight on Earth and Venus. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm

---------------

, the question says the astronaut weighs 211 pounds on Earth and 182 pounds on Venus. I need to find what percent 182 is of 211.

Wait, percentage

---------------

 problems can sometimes trip me up, but I think I remember the formula. Oh right, to find what percent one number is of another, I divide

---------------

 the part by the whole and then multiply by 100. So in this case, the part is the Venus weight, 182, and the whole is the Earth weight, 211.

So I

---------------

 should calculate 182 divided by 211. Let me get my calculator out. 182 ÷ 211 equals

---------------

... Hmm, let me compute that. 211 goes into 182 zero times. Wait, that's

---------------

 not right. Oh wait, no, wait. 182 is less than 211, so the result

---------------

 will be less than 1. Let me actually compute it.

182 divided by 211. Let's see, 211 times

---------------

 0.8 is 168.8, which is less than 182. 0.85

---------------

 would be 211 * 0.85 = 179.35. Still less than 182. Let

---------------

's try 0.86: 211 * 0.86. Let me calculate 200*0.86=172, 11*0.86=9.46, so total is 181.46. Oh

---------------

, that's really close to 182. So 0.86 would give about 181.46, which

---------------

 is just a little less than 182. So 182 is approximately 0.86 times 211.

---------------

 So that's 86% because 0.86 times 100 is 86%.

Wait, but

---------------

 wait a second. Let me do the division more accurately. 182 ÷ 211.

Alternatively, maybe

---------------

 I can compute it as a fraction and then convert to a percentage. So 182 over 211.

---------------

 Let me see, 211 is a prime number, I think, so it doesn't divide into 182 easily

---------------

. Let me do the division step by step.

211 goes into 182 zero times, so we add

---------------

 a decimal point and a zero, making it 1820. How many times does 211 go into 1820? Let me estimate

---------------

. 211 * 8 is 1688. 211 * 9 is 1899, which is too

---------------

 big because 1899 is more than 1820. So 8 times. 8 *211 is 1688. Subtract that from 1820: 1820 - 1688 is 132. Bring down the next zero, making it 1320.

2

---------------

11 goes into 1320 how many times? Let's see, 211 *6 is 1266. That

---------------

's under 1320. 211*7 is 1477, which is over. So 6 times. 6*211=1266. Subtract that

---------------

: 1320-1266=54. Bring down a zero, making 540.

211 into 540. Let me see, 2*211=422. 3*211=633,

---------------

 which is too big. So 2 times. 2*211=422. Subtract: 540-422=118. Bring down a zero, making 1180.

211 into 1180. Let

---------------

's see, 5*211=1055. 6*211=1266 which

---------------

 is too big. So 5 times. 5*211=1055. Subtract: 1180-1055=125. Bring down a zero, making 1250.

211 into 1250: 5 times because

---------------

 5*211=1055. 6*211 is 1266,

---------------

 which is more than 1250. So 5 times. 1055 subtracted from 1250 is

---------------

 195. Hmm, this is getting a bit lengthy, but I think the trend is that the decimal is approximately

---------------

 0.862.

So 0.862 times 100 is 86.2%. So

---------------

 the percentage is approximately 86%, which would correspond to option D. Looking back at the options, D is 86%

---------------

.


To determine what percent the astronaut's weight on Venus (182 pounds) is of their weight on Earth (211 pounds), we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100
\]

Here, the "Part" is 182 (Venus weight), and the "Whole" is 211 (Earth weight). Substituting these values:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{182}{211} \right) \times 100
\]

Performing the division \( \frac{182}{211} \), we find that it is approximately 0.86. Multiplying by 100 gives:

\[
\text{Percentage} \approx 86\%
\]

Thus, the astronaut's weight on Venus is approximately 86% of their weight on Earth. Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**D) 86%**
