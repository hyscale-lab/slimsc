Okay, so I'm trying to solve this percentage problem. Let me read the question again to make sure I get it right.

So

---------------

, the shopkeeper gives a 20% discount on all items for one day. Then, the next day, he has

---------------

 to sell them at the original price again. The question is asking by what percentage he must increase the discounted price to get back to the original price. Hmm, I

---------------

 think I remember something about percentage increase and decrease. Let me think about it step by step.

Let me assume the original price of an item is, say, $100. That

---------------

's a common number to make percentages easy. So, if the original price is $100, a 20% discount would reduce

---------------

 the price. How do I calculate that? Oh right, 20% of 100 is 20, so the discounted price is 100 - 20 = $80. 



---------------

Now, the next day, he wants to sell it back at the original price, which is $100. But he

---------------

's currently selling it at $80. So, he needs to increase the price from $80 to $100. The

---------------

 question is, what's the percentage increase needed here?

Wait, percentage increase is calculated based on the original value before the increase, right? So the

---------------

 formula is (Increase / Original) * 100%. In this case, the increase is from $80 to $100. So the increase amount is 100 - 80 = $20.

So

---------------

 plugging into the formula: (20 / 80) * 100% = (0.25) * 100% = 25%. So

---------------

 the shopkeeper needs to increase the price by 25% to get back to the original price.

Wait, let me check

---------------

 if I did that correctly. So, if I take the discounted price of $80 and add 25%, that

---------------

's 80 + (25% of 80). 25% of 80 is 20, so 80 +20 =

---------------

 100. Yep, that's correct.

So looking at the options, option C is 25%, which would

---------------

 be the correct answer.

Another way to think about it: when you decrease by a certain percentage and then want to increase back, the percentage needed

---------------

 isn't the same as the decrease. Because the base changes. For example, a 20% decrease takes the base to

---------------

 a lower value, so to get back, you have to calculate based on that lower value.

Let me see another example to

---------------

 confirm. Suppose the original price is $200. 20% discount is $40, so new price is $160. To get back to $200, the increase is

---------------

 40 over 160. 40/160 is 0.25, so 25%. Yep

---------------

, same result.

So the answer should be 25%, which is option C.


To solve the problem, let's assume the original price of an item is $100. A 20% discount reduces the price to $80. The shopkeeper wants

---------------

 to return the price to $100 the next day. The increase needed is $20 (from $80 to $100). Percentage

---------------

 increase is calculated as:

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left(\frac{\text{Increase}}{\text{Original Discount

---------------

ed Price}}\right) \times 100\% = \left(\frac{20}{80}\right) \times 100\% = 25\%.
\]

Thus, the shopkeeper must increase the price by 25% to return to the original price. The

---------------

 correct answer is:
