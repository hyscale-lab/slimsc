Okay, so I've got this problem here about two trains leaving a station at different intervals, and I need to figure out when they'll both leave again

---------------

 at the same time. Hmm, I remember something about this from math class. It must have something to do with multiples or something

---------------

 like that.

Alright, let's read the problem again. Train A leaves every 16 minutes, Train B every 17 minutes. They just left together, and I need to find out

---------------

 how long until that happens again. So, I think this is about finding a common multiple of their departure intervals. Oh wait, right

---------------

, the least common multiple, LCM. Because the LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that's a multiple of both,

---------------

 which would mean both trains leave at that same time again.

So, how do I find the LCM of 16 and 17? I

---------------

 remember that LCM can be found using the formula: LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b), where GCD is the greatest common divisor. But

---------------

 wait, 16 and 17 are consecutive numbers. Are they co-prime? I think so because 17 is a prime number,

---------------

 and 16 is 2^4, so they don't share any common factors except 1. So the GCD of 16 and 17 is 1. 



---------------

If that's the case, then the LCM would be 16 multiplied by 17. Let me calculate that. 16 times 17...

---------------

 10 times 17 is 170, 6 times 17 is 102. So

---------------

 170 + 102 is 272. So the LCM is 272 minutes. That

---------------

 means after 272 minutes, both trains will leave the station together again.

Looking at the options, option A is 272 minutes. So

---------------

 that should be the correct answer. The other options are much smaller numbers or don't fit. For instance, 70 minutes

---------------

 is way less than 16*17, but since 17 is a prime, I don't think 

---------------

70 is a multiple of 17. Wait, 17 times 4 is 68, which is close to 70, but that

---------------

's not a multiple. So 70 can't be the LCM. Same with the others—304 is 

---------------

16*19, but 17 times 18 is 306, so that's not it

---------------

. 190 is 16*11.875, which isn't a whole number, so that

---------------

's not a multiple either. 35 is way too small, and E is 35, which is just 

---------------

17*2 + 1, so no.

So yeah, the only option that makes sense is A) 272 minutes.


To determine when Train A and Train B will leave the station simultaneously again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their departure intervals, which are 16 minutes and 17 minutes, respectively. 

The formula for LCM is:

\[
\text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
\]

Here, \(a = 16\) and \(b = 17\). Since 16 and 17 are consecutive integers, they are co-prime, meaning their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. Substituting into the formula:

\[
\text{LCM}(16, 17) = \frac{16 \times 17}{1} = 272
\]

Thus, the LCM of 16 and 17 is 272 minutes. This means that after 272 minutes, both trains will leave the station simultaneously again. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) 272 minutes**

The other options are

---------------

 either too small or do not satisfy the condition of being a common multiple of 16 and 17. Therefore, the correct answer is:
