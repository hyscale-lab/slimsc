Okay, so I have this problem where two trains leave a station at the same time, and I need to find out after how many minutes they'll both leave together again. Hmm, let

---------------

's see. The problem says Train A leaves every 16 minutes and Train B every 17 minutes. Both just left together

---------------

, so I think this is a problem about finding when they'll coincide again.

Wait, right, this sounds like finding the least common multiple (LCM) of their intervals. Because

---------------

 the LCM of two numbers gives the smallest number that is a multiple of both. So, the next time they both leave together would

---------------

 be the LCM of 16 and 17.

Let me think about how to calculate the LCM. I

---------------

 remember that LCM can be found using the formula: LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b), where GCD is the greatest common divisor. So

---------------

 I need to find the GCD of 16 and 17 first.

What's the GCD of 16 and 17? Well, 17 is a prime number. Its

---------------

 factors are only 1 and 17. 16's factors are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16. So

---------------

 the only common factor is 1. That means GCD(16,17) is 1.

So pl

---------------

ugging into the formula, LCM = (16 * 17) / 1 = 272. Wait

---------------

, but wait a minute, 16 times 17 is 272. So the LCM is 272 minutes. So

---------------

 that would be option A, 272 minutes.

But wait, let me make sure. Because sometimes when two numbers are consecutive,

---------------

 like 16 and 17, they are coprime, meaning their GCD is 1. So their

---------------

 LCM would indeed be their product. So 16*17=272. So yes, that's

---------------

 correct.

Let me think if there's any other way to approach this. Maybe listing the multiples and seeing when they coincide.

---------------

 Let's try that quickly.

Multiples of 16: 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 144, 160, 176, 192, 208, 224, 240, 256, 272, 

---------------

288, etc.

Multiples of 17: 17, 34, 51, 68, 85, 102, 119, 136, 153, 170, 187, 204, 221, 238, 255, 272, etc.

Looking for the first common multiple after zero,

---------------

 which is 272. Yep, that's the same as before. So the answer should be 272 minutes.

Looking

---------------

 back at the options, option A is 272. So the correct answer is A.


To determine when Train A and Train B will leave the station simultaneously again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their intervals, which are 16 minutes and 17 minutes, respectively. The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both.

Using the formula for LCM:


---------------

\[
\text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
\]
where GCD is the greatest common divisor. Since 17 is a prime number and 16 is not a multiple of 17, the only common divisor of 16 and 17 is 1. Thus:
\[
\text{GCD}(16, 17) = 1
\]
Substituting into the formula:
\[
\text{LCM}(16, 17) = \frac{16 \times 17}{1} = 272
\]
Therefore, the trains will leave simultaneously again after 272 minutes. Ver

---------------

ifying by listing multiples confirms that 272 is the first common multiple of 16 and 17.

The correct answer is **A) 272 minutes**.
