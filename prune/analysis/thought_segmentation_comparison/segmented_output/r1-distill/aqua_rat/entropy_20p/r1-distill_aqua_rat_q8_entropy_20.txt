Okay, so I've got this problem here about 200 students in a school. The question is about figuring out the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session. Hmm, let

---------------

's break it down.

So, the problem states that at least 45% attended the prom. Let me calculate that.

---------------

 45% of 200 is 0.45 * 200 = 90 students. So, at least 90 went to the prom. Wait

---------------

, no, actually, "at least" means it could be more, right? So, 90 is the minimum number

---------------

 that went, but more could have.

Similarly, at least 35% took part in the debating session. 35% of 200 is 0.35 * 200 = 70 students. So, at

---------------

 least 70 were in the debate, but again, possibly more.

The question is asking for the maximum number of students who could

---------------

 have neither attended the prom nor the debate. So, to maximize the number of students who did neither, we need to minimize the number who did either.

---------------

 Wait, no, wait. Because if more students attended prom or debate, that would leave fewer who did neither. So,

---------------

 to maximize the neither group, we need as few students as possible in both groups.

But wait, how do these two groups overlap? Because

---------------

 some students might have attended both the prom and the debate. So, the principle here is probably the inclusion-exclusion principle.

---------------

 The maximum number of students who attended either event would be the sum of those who attended prom and those who debated, minus the overlap.

---------------

 But since we're trying to find the maximum number who did neither, we need to minimize the number who did either. So

---------------

, to minimize the number who did either, we need to maximize the overlap between prom and debate attendees.

Wait, that makes

---------------

 sense. Because if as many students as possible attended both events, then the total number attending at least one event would be as small as possible. Which

---------------

 in turn would leave as many as possible who attended neither.

So, the formula for the maximum number of students who attended either prom

---------------

 or debate is the sum of prom and debate attendees minus the maximum possible overlap. Because the maximum possible overlap can't exceed the smaller of the two numbers

---------------

. Let me think.

So, the minimum number attending prom is 90, the minimum attending debate is 70. So

---------------

, the maximum overlap would be 70, because all 70 debate attendees could have also gone to prom. That

---------------

 way, the total number attending at least one event is 90 + (70 - 70) = 90.

---------------

 Wait, no, that's not right. If all 70 debate attendees were also in prom, then the total is

---------------

 90 (since 70 are already in the 90). So, the total unique attendees would be 90.

---------------

 So, the number of students who attended either would be 90, and the rest (200 -90=

---------------

110) didn't attend either.

But wait, that can't be right because the problem says "at least" 45% and

---------------

 35% attended. So, the number attending prom could be higher than 90, same with debate. So

---------------

, the maximum number of students who did neither would be when the number attending prom is exactly 90, debate is exactly 70, and their

---------------

 overlap is as much as possible, which is 70. So, the number who attended either is 90,

---------------

 so 200-90=110. But wait, 110 is one of the options.

---------------

 Let me check the options again.

Options are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110. So E is 110. But

---------------

 wait, let me think again.

Wait, another approach. The maximum number of students who could have neither attended prom nor debate is the

---------------

 total number minus the minimum number who attended at least one of the two events.

The minimum number who attended at least one event

---------------

 is the sum of the minimum attendees minus the maximum possible overlap. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the

---------------

 formula is |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|. To minimize |A ∪ B|, we

---------------

 need to maximize |A ∩ B|.

So, since |A| is at least 90, |B| at least 70. The maximum possible |A ∩ B| is the minimum of |A| and |B|. So

---------------

, if |A| is exactly 90 and |B| is exactly 70, then the maximum overlap is 70.

So, |A ∪ B| would

---------------

 be 90 +70 -70 =90. So, 90 students attended at least one event. So

---------------

, the number who didn't attend either is 200 -90 =110. So, that's the

---------------

 maximum possible.

But wait, what if the numbers for prom and debate are higher than their minimums? For example, suppose

---------------

 100 students went to prom and 70 to debate. Then the overlap could be 70. Then |

---------------

A ∪ B|=100 +70-70=100. So, 200-100=100,

---------------

 which is less than 110. So, to maximize the neither group, the prom and debate numbers should be exactly

---------------

 their minimums, and the overlap as much as possible.

So, the maximum number is 110. But looking

---------------

 at the options, E is 110. So, the answer should be E.

Wait, but let me make

---------------

 sure. Is there any scenario where the neither group could be larger? Let's say, what if the prom and debate numbers

---------------

 are exactly 90 and 70, respectively, and the overlap is 70. Then, 90 +

---------------

70-70=90 in either. So, 110 neither. But if the prom and debate numbers

---------------

 are higher, say 90 and 80, then the maximum overlap is 70. So, |A ∪ B| would

---------------

 be 90 +80 -70=100. So, 100 attendees, 100 neither.

---------------

 So, which is less than 110.

So, yes, the maximum is 110 when the prom

---------------

 and debate attendances are at their minimums, with maximum overlap. So, the answer is E)110.


To determine the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. 

1

---------------

. **Minimum attendees**:  
   - At least 45% of 200 students attended the prom night, which is \( 0.45 \times 200 = 90 \) students.  
   - At least 35% of 200 students participated in the debating session, which is \( 0.35 \times 200 = 70 \) students.  

2. **Overlap maximization**:  
   To minimize the number of students who attended at least one event (prom or debate), we maximize the overlap between the two groups. The maximum possible overlap is the smaller of the two minimums, which is 70 (the number of debate attendees). Thus, all 70 debate attendees could also have attended the prom.  

3. **Total unique attendees**:  
   Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, the total number of unique students who attended at least one event is:  
   \[
   |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| = 90 + 70 - 70 = 90
   \]  
   Therefore, 90 students attended at least one event.  

4. **Students who attended neither**:  
   The total number of students is 200. Subtracting the number of students who attended at least one event gives:  
   \[
   200 - 90 = 110
   \]  

Thus, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is **110**.
