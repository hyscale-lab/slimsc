Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the maximum distance I can travel with $8.50 in a cab. Let

---------------

 me try to break it down step by step.

First, I'll read the question again carefully. The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile. Then, each

---------------

 additional quarter mile costs 10 cents. So, the initial charge is a flat fee, and after that, it's a

---------------

 per-quarter-mile rate. I need to figure out how far I can go with $8.50.

Hmm, let

---------------

's think about the total amount I have, which is $8.50. The first thing that happens is the initial

---------------

 charge of $3.50. So I should subtract that from the total to see how much money I have left for the additional distance. 

Calcul

---------------

ating that: $8.50 minus $3.50 equals $5.00. So I have $5.00 left to spend on the extra quarter miles.

Now, each additional quarter mile costs 10 cents. I

---------------

 need to find out how many of these I can buy with $5.00. Let me convert $5.00 into cents to make it easier.

---------------

 Since $1 is 100 cents, $5 is 500 cents.

Each quarter mile is 10 cents, so the

---------------

 number of additional quarter miles I can get is 500 cents divided by 10 cents per quarter mile. That

---------------

's 500 / 10 = 50. So, 50 additional quarter miles.

Wait, but

---------------

 wait a second. The initial charge covers the first quarter mile, right? So the total distance would be that first quarter mile plus the

---------------

 50 additional quarter miles. Let me compute that.

Each quarter mile is 0.25 miles. So 

---------------

50 quarter miles would be 50 * 0.25. Let's calculate that: 50 * 0.25 is 12.5 miles. Then

---------------

, adding the initial quarter mile: 12.5 + 0.25 = 12.75 miles. So

---------------

 the total distance would be 12.75 miles.

Looking at the options, option B is 12.75 miles. So

---------------

 that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 



---------------

Total money: $8.50
Initial charge: $3.50 → remaining $5.00.



---------------

Each additional quarter mile is $0.10. So how many can I get? $5 / $0.10 = 50. So

---------------

 50 quarter miles. Each is 0.25, so 50 * 0.25 = 12.5.

---------------

 Plus the first 0.25 gives 12.75. Yep, that's correct.

Another way: Let

---------------

's calculate the total cost. Initial $3.50 + (50 * 0.10) = 3.50 + 5.00 = 8.50. That

---------------

's exactly the money I have. So no problem there.

So the answer is B)12.75 miles.


To determine the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 in a cab, we

---------------

 start by analyzing the cost structure. The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and $0.10 for each additional quarter-mile. 

1. Subtract the initial charge from the total amount:  
   \[
   \$8.50 - \$3.50 = \$5.00
   \]  
   This leaves \$5.00 for additional quarter-miles.

2. Calculate how many additional quarter-miles can be purchased with \$5.00:  
   \[
   \frac{\$5.00}{\$0.10} = 50 \text{ quarter-miles}
   \]

3. Convert the total number of quarter-miles into miles:  
   -

---------------

 The first quarter-mile is included in the initial charge.  
   - The additional 50 quarter-miles amount to:  
     \[
     50 \times 0.25 = 12.5 \text{ miles}
     \]  
   - Adding the initial quarter-mile:  
     \[
     12.5 + 0.25 = 12.75 \text{ miles}
     \]

Thus, the maximum distance you can travel is **12.75 miles**, which corresponds to option **B**.
