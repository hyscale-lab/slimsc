So each pair of a and d, b and e, c and f must sum to 9.\n\nNow, moving on to the second condition.\n\nAD + BE + CF = 99.\n\nWhere:\n\nAD is the two-digit number formed by a and d, which is 10a + d.\n\nSimilarly, BE is 10b + e.\n\nCF is 10c + f.\n\nSo the sum is:\n\n(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.\n\nSimplify this:\n\n10a + d + 10b + e +10c +f = 99.\n\nGrouping similar terms:\n\n10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.\n\nHmm, interesting. Now, from the first condition, we have a + d =9, b + e=9, c + f=9.\n\nSo, adding these three equations:\n\n(a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = 9 + 9 + 9 = 27.\n\nWhich is a + b + c + d + e + f =27.\n\nFrom the second equation, 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) =99.\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c, and T = d + e + f.\n\nThen, the second equation becomes 10S + T =99.\n\nAnd from the first condition, S + T =27.\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1. 10S + T =99\n\n2. S + T =27\n\nWe can solve these two equations for S and T.\n\nSubtracting equation 2 from equation 1:\n\n(10S + T) - (S + T) =99 -27\n\n9S =72\n\nSo S=8.\n\nThen, from equation 2, T=27-8=19.\n\nSo S=8, T=19.\n\nSo S is the sum of a + b + c =8.\n\nAnd T is the sum of d + e + f =19.\n\nNow, let's recap what we have so far.\n\nFrom the first condition:\n\na + d =9 \u2192 d=9 \u2212a\n\nb + e=9 \u2192 e=9 \u2212b\n\nc + f=9 \u2192 f=9 \u2212c\n\nAnd from the second condition, we have:\n\na + b + c =8\n\nd + e + f=19.\n\nBut since d=9\u2212a, e=9\u2212b, f=9\u2212c, substituting into d + e + f:\n\n(9\u2212a) + (9\u2212b) + (9\u2212c) =27 \u2212 (a + b + c) =27 \u22128=19, which matches. So that's consistent.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the number of digit assignments (a, b, c, d, e, f) where:\n\n- a, b, c are digits (0-9), with a + b + c=8.\n\n- d, e, f are given by d=9\u2212a, e=9\u2212b, f=9\u2212c.\n\nAdditionally, since DEF is a three-digit number, d cannot be zero, because DEF is a three-digit number, so d must be at least 1. So d=9\u2212a \u22651 \u2192 a \u22648.\n\nBut a is a digit, so a can be 0 to 8, but let's see.",

So, the only possibility is c + f =9.\n\nHmm, so c + f =9.\n\nSo, 11c +f =11c + (9 -c) = 10c +9.\n\nSo, 11c +f +1=10c +10=10(c +1).\n\nSo, 10*(d -b)=10(c +1).\n\nDivide both sides by 10:\n\nd - b = c +1.\n\nSo, d = b + c +1.\n\nSo, we get a relation between d, b, and c.\n\nSo, from equation 3, we had:\n\ne =100 -10a +c -11d.\n\nBut we can substitute d from above:\n\nd = b + c +1.\n\nSo, e =100 -10a +c -11*(b +c +1) = 100 -10a +c -11b -11c -11.\n\nSimplify:\n\n100 -11 =89\n\nc -11c = -10c\n\nSo, e=89 -10a -11b -10c.\n\nHmm, that's e in terms of a, b, c.\n\nSo, e must be a digit, 0-9.\n\nSo, 89 -10a -11b -10c must be between 0 and9, inclusive.\n\nSo, 0 <=89 -10a -11b -10c <=9.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n80 <=10a +11b +10c <=89.\n\nHmm, interesting.\n\nSo, 10a +11b +10c is between 80 and 89.\n\nLet me note that a, b, c are digits (0-9).\n\nSo, 10a is from 0 to90, 11b is from 0 to99, 10c is from 0 to90.\n\nBut 10a +11b +10c ranges between 0 and 90+99+90=279, but in our case, it's 80-89.\n\nHmm, so we have 10a +11b +10c = K, where K is 80,81,...,89.\n\nSo, our equation is 10a +11b +10c = K, for K from 80 to89.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n10a +10c +11b = K.\n\nFactor 10 from a and c:\n\n10(a + c) +11b = K.\n\nSo, 10(a + c) = K -11b.\n\nWhich implies that K -11b must be a multiple of 10.\n\nBecause 10(a + c) is a multiple of 10.\n\nSo, K -11b \u22610 mod10.\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n-11b \u2261 -K mod10.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n11b \u2261 K mod10.\n\nBut 11 \u22611 mod10, so:\n\nb \u2261 K mod10.\n\nBecause 11b \u2261b mod10.\n\nSo, b \u2261 K mod10.\n\nBut K is between 80-89, so K mod10 is 0-9, but in this case, K is 80-89, so K mod10 is 0-9 for K=80:0, 81:1,...,89:9.\n\nSo, for each K in 80-89, b must be equal to K mod10, i.e., b=K%10.",
          "text2": "Wait, earlier we said 11(a + d) + b is between 99 and 108.\n\nBut since 11(a +d)=99, then 99 + b is between 99 and 108.\n\nSo, 99 +b must be between 99 and 108.\n\nWhich is always true since b is a digit (0-9). So, 99 + b is between 99 and 108.\n\nSo, no additional constraints from that.\n\nSo, from a +d=9.\n\nAlso, from S=8, a +b +c=8, and c=8 -a -b.\n\nBut a is a digit (0-9), and since a +d=9, d=9 -a.\n\nSo, d=9 -a.\n\nSimilarly, from equation 3, e=100 -10a +c -11d.\n\nBut since d=9 -a, substitute:\n\ne=100 -10a +c -11*(9 -a).\n\nSimplify:\n\n100 -10a +c -99 +11a.\n\nWhich is 1 + a + c.\n\nSo, e=1 + a + c.\n\nBut from S=8, c=8 -a -b.\n\nSo, e=1 + a + (8 -a -b)=1 +8 -b=9 -b.\n\nThus, e=9 -b.\n\nBut since e is a digit between 0 and9, 9 -b must be between 0 and9.\n\nWhich is true since b is between0 and9.\n\nSo, e=9 -b.\n\nAlso, from T=19, d + e + f=19.\n\nWe know d=9 -a, e=9 -b.\n\nSo,\n\nd + e + f= (9 -a) + (9 -b) + f=18 -a -b +f=19.\n\nSo,\n\n18 -a -b +f=19 \u21d2 f=1 +a +b.\n\nSo, f=1 +a +b.\n\nBut f is a digit (0-9). So,\n\n1 +a +b \u22649 \u21d2 a +b \u22648.\n\nBut since a +b +c=8, and c=8 -a -b, which is non-negative, so a +b can be from0 to8.\n\nBut let's see: Since a is a digit, and a +d=9, d=9 -a must be a digit as well, so 9 -a \u22650 \u21d2 a \u22649. Which is already satisfied as a is a digit.\n\nSo, the constraints so far:\n\na is from0 to9, but a +d=9, so a can be from0 to9, but d=9 -a must be a digit, so a can be0-9, but if a=0, d=9; a=1, d=8; ..., a=9, d=0.\n\nSimilarly, e=9 -b, so b can be0-9, e=9 -b, which is also a digit.\n\nf=1 +a +b, which must be \u22649, so a +b \u22648.\n\nAlso, since a +b +c=8, c=8 -a -b. So, c is non-negative, so a +b \u22648.\n\nWhich is already satisfied because of f=1 +a +b \u22649.\n\nSo, now, the variables are a and b, with a and b being digits (0-9), and a +b \u22648.\n\nSo, a can range from0 to8 (since a +b \u22648, and b is at least 0).\n\nBut a can be up to 8, as a=8, then b=0.",
