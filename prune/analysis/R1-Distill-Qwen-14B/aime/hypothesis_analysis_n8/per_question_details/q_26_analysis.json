Let's see, 1555 \u00f75=311, 3920 \u00f75=784. So, 311\u221a14 /784.\n\nSo, the slope of OB is (311\u221a14)/784.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the tangent at B is the negative reciprocal: -784/(311\u221a14).\n\nRationalize denominator: -784\u221a14/(311*14)= -784\u221a14/(4354)= Simplify.\n\n784 \u00f714=56, 4354 \u00f714=311 (since 14*311=4354). So, it becomes -56\u221a14/311.\n\nTherefore, the equation of the tangent at B is y - y_B = m*(x -x_B), where m is the slope.\n\nSo, y - (6\u221a14/5) = (-56\u221a14/311)(x -39/5).\n\nSo, that's the equation for the tangent at B.\n\nNow, point D is the intersection of the two tangents: tangent at C is y= -4\u221a14 x, and tangent at B is y -6\u221a14/5 = (-56\u221a14/311)(x -39/5).\n\nLet me solve these two equations to find D.\n\nSubstitute y= -4\u221a14 x into the second equation.\n\nSo, (-4\u221a14 x) -6\u221a14/5 = (-56\u221a14/311)(x -39/5).\n\nLet me factor out \u221a14 on both sides:\n\n\u221a14 [ -4x -6/5 ] = \u221a14 [ (-56/311)(x -39/5) ].\n\nCancel out \u221a14:\n\n-4x -6/5 = (-56/311)(x -39/5).\n\nMultiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-4x*311 -6/5 *311 = -56(x -39/5).\n\nCompute each term:\n\nLeft side:\n\n-4*311 x = -1244x.\n\n-6/5 *311= - (6*311)/5= -1866/5.\n\nRight side:\n\n-56x + (56*39)/5= -56x + (2184)/5.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n-1244x -1866/5 = -56x +2184/5.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-1244x +56x -1866/5 -2184/5 =0.\n\nCompute:\n\n-1188x - (1866 +2184)/5 =0.\n\n1866+2184=4050.\n\nSo, -1188x -4050/5=0 \u2192 -1188x -810=0.\n\nSo, -1188x=810 \u2192 x=810/(-1188).\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 18: 810 \u00f718=45, 1188 \u00f718=66.\n\nSo, x= -45/66. Simplify further: both divided by 3: -15/22.\n\nSo, x= -15/22.\n\nThen, y= -4\u221a14 x= -4\u221a14*(-15/22)=60\u221a14/22=30\u221a14/11.\n\nSo, point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, I need to find the equation of line AD, which connects A(10,0) and D(-15/22,30\u221a14/11). Then, find its intersection with \u03c9 again at point P, then find the length AP.\n\nFirst, find the parametric equations or the slope of AD.\n\nCompute the slope of AD:\n\nm= (y_D - y_A)/(x_D -x_A)= (30\u221a14/11 -0)/( -15/22 -10 )= (30\u221a14/11)/(-15/22 -220/22)= (30\u221a14/11)/(-235/22).\n\nSimplify:\n\n30\u221a14/11 * (-22/235)= (30\u221a14 * -22)/(11*235)= (-660\u221a14)/(2585).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator by 5: 660 \u00f75=132, 2585 \u00f75=517.\n\nSo, slope m= -132\u221a14/517.",

So, the slope of the tangent at B is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the radius from the center to B.\n\nThe center is O (5,5\u221a14/56), and point B is (39/5,6\u221a14/5).\n\nSo, the slope of OB is (y_B - y_O)/(x_B - x_O).\n\nCompute y_B - y_O:\n\n6\u221a14/5 -5\u221a14/56 = (6\u221a14 * 56 -5\u221a14 *5)/(5*56) = (336\u221a14 -25\u221a14)/280 = (311\u221a14)/280.\n\nx_B - x_O: 39/5 -5 = 39/5 -25/5 =14/5.\n\nSo, slope of OB is (311\u221a14/280)/(14/5) = (311\u221a14/280)*(5/14) = (311\u221a14 *5)/(280 *14) = (1555\u221a14)/(3920).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator by dividing by 5: numerator 311\u221a14, denominator 784.\n\nSo, slope of OB is (311\u221a14)/784.\n\nThus, the slope of the tangent at B is the negative reciprocal: -784/(311\u221a14).\n\nWe can rationalize that to make it cleaner: -784/(311\u221a14) = (-784\u221a14)/(311*14) = (-784\u221a14)/(4354).\n\nBut 784 \u00f714 is 56, so 784 =14*56, so:\n\n= (-56\u221a14)/311.\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent at B is (-56\u221a14)/311.\n\nSimilarly, let's find the equation of the tangent at B.\n\nUsing point-slope form:\n\ny - y_B = m*(x -x_B)\n\nWhere m is the slope of the tangent, which is (-56\u221a14)/311.\n\nSo,\n\ny - 6\u221a14/5 = (-56\u221a14)/311 (x - 39/5)\n\nSimilarly, find the equation of the tangent at C.\n\nPoint C is at (0,0). The tangent at C is perpendicular to the radius OC.\n\nSlope of OC: from center (5,5\u221a14/56) to C (0,0):\n\nSlope is (0 -5\u221a14/56)/(0 -5) = (-5\u221a14/56)/(-5) = (\u221a14)/56.\n\nTherefore, the slope of OC is \u221a14/56.\n\nThus, the slope of the tangent at C is the negative reciprocal: -56/\u221a14.\n\nSimplify: -56/\u221a14 = (-56\u221a14)/14 = (-4\u221a14).\n\nSo, the tangent at C has slope -4\u221a14.\n\nEquation of tangent at C: passes through (0,0), so y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\nNow, we have two tangent lines: at B and at C.

          "text2": "Wait, sides are AB=5, BC=9, AC=10.\n\nSo, triangle ABC has sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10.\n\nSo, let me place point C at (0, 0), point B at (9, 0), because BC=9. Then point A is somewhere in the plane. Let me find coordinates for A.\n\nGiven that AC=10 and AB=5. So, point A is at (x, y), such that distance from A to C (0,0) is 10, and distance from A to B (9,0) is 5.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 10\u00b2 = 100,\n\nand\n\n(x - 9)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 5\u00b2 = 25.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\n(x - 9)^2 + y^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = 25 - 100,\n\nExpanding (x - 9)^2: x\u00b2 - 18x + 81.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 - 18x + 81 + y\u00b2 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = -75,\n\nSimplify: -18x + 81 = -75,\n\nSo, -18x = -156,\n\nx = (-156)/(-18) = 156/18 = 26/3 \u2248 8.666...\n\nSo, x = 26/3.\n\nThen, plug x back into x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100:\n\n(26/3)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100,\n\n(676/9) + y\u00b2 = 100,\n\ny\u00b2 = 100 - 676/9 = (900/9 - 676/9) = 224/9,\n\nSo, y = sqrt(224/9) = (sqrt(224))/3 = (sqrt(16*14))/3 = (4 sqrt(14))/3.\n\nSo, point A is at (26/3, 4 sqrt(14)/3).\n\nSo, to recap, our coordinates are:\n\nC: (0, 0),\n\nB: (9, 0),\n\nA: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3).\n\nNow, let's find the equation of the tangent lines at B and C to the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nFirst, we need the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9 passing through points A, B, C.\n\nLet me find the circumcircle equation.\n\nGiven three points: A (26/3, 4\u221a14/3), B (9, 0), and C (0, 0).\n\nWe can find the circumcircle equation using the circumradius formula or by solving the system.\n\nThe general equation of a circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0.\n\nPlugging in point C (0,0):\n\n0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0 \u21d2 F = 0.\n\nSo, equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey = 0.\n\nNow, plug in point B (9, 0):\n\n81 + 0 + 9D + 0 = 0 \u21d2 81 + 9D = 0 \u21d2 9D = -81 \u21d2 D = -9.\n\nSo, equation now is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + Ey = 0.\n\nNow, plug in point A (26/3, 4\u221a14/3):\n\n(26/3)^2 + (4\u221a14/3)^2 -9*(26/3) + E*(4\u221a14/3) = 0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(26/3)^2 = (676)/9,\n\n(4\u221a14/3)^2 = (16*14)/9 = 224/9,\n\n-9*(26/3) = -78,\n\nE*(4\u221a14/3) = (4\u221a14 E)/3.\n\nSo, adding all terms:\n\n676/9 + 224/9 - 78 + (4\u221a14 E)/3 = 0.\n\nCombine 676/9 + 224/9 = 900/9 = 100.\n\nSo, 100 - 78 + (4\u221a14 E)/3 = 0.\n\n100 -78 = 22.\n\nSo, 22 + (4\u221a14 E)/3 = 0 \u21d2 (4\u221a14 E)/3 = -22 \u21d2 E = (-22 * 3)/(4\u221a14) = (-66)/(4\u221a14) = (-33)/(2\u221a14).\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\nE = (-33)/(2\u221a14) * (\u221a14/\u221a14) = (-33\u221a14)/(2*14) = (-33\u221a14)/(28).\n\nSo, the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9 is:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y = 0.",
