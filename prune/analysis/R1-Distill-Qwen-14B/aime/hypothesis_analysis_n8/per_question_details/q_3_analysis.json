Let's compute that.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 4 numbers with zero matches: that means all 4 of her numbers are different from the 4 chosen. So, how many ways can this happen? Well, Jen has 4 numbers, and the lottery picks 4 numbers not overlapping with hers. Since the set S has 10 numbers, and Jen has 4, there are 6 numbers not in her set. So, the number of ways is C(6,4). \n\nCalculating that: C(6,4) = 15.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways she has exactly one match: that's choosing 1 number from her 4, and the remaining 3 from the 6 non-her numbers. So, that's C(4,1) * C(6,3). Let's compute that:\n\nC(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, 4 * 20 = 80.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways she can have fewer than two matches is 15 + 80 = 95.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes for B (at least two matches) is total outcomes minus this, which is 210 - 95 = 115.",
