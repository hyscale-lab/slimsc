So, R = 100Q - 2,000,000.\n\nBut R is the product abc, and Q is ab + bc + ac. So, we have a relation between Q and R.\n\nNow, in the context of symmetric equations, perhaps I can find possible values of Q that satisfy this equation.\n\nBut I also know that for nonnegative integers a, b, c, Q must be nonnegative, as must R.\n\nSo, 100Q - 2,000,000 \u2265 0 \u2192 Q \u2265 20,000.\n\nAlso, since S = 300, the maximum possible value of Q is when two variables are as large as possible, and the third is zero. For example, if c = 0, then Q = ab + 0 + 0 = ab. Since a + b = 300, the maximum ab is when a = b = 150, so Q_max = 150*150 = 22,500. So, Q can range from 0 to 22,500, but in our case, Q \u2265 20,000.\n\nSo, Q is between 20,000 and 22,500.\n\nSo, 20,000 \u2264 Q \u2264 22,500.\n\nBut since Q must be an integer (as a, b, c are integers), Q can take integer values from 20,000 to 22,500.\n\nBut R must also be an integer because it's abc. So, R = 100Q - 2,000,000 must be an integer, which it will be since Q is integer.\n\nSo, now, for each Q in [20,000, 22,500], we can compute R = 100Q - 2,000,000.

So, since we know a + b + c = 300, let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, P = ab + bc + ca, and Q = abc. Then,\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = S\u00b3 - 3SP + 3Q.\n\nSo, substituting back into our equation:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (S\u00b3 - 3SP + 3Q) = 6,000,000.\n\nNow, let's compute a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2. I know another identity: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2P.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 300\u00b2 - 2P = 90,000 - 2P.\n\nSubstituting back into the equation:\n\n300*(90,000 - 2P) - (S\u00b3 - 3SP + 3Q) = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst, 300*(90,000 - 2P):\n\n= 300*90,000 - 300*2P\n= 27,000,000 - 600P.\n\nNext, S\u00b3 is 300\u00b3 = 27,000,000. Then, 3SP is 3*300*P = 900P. So, S\u00b3 - 3SP + 3Q becomes:\n\n27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q.\n\nSo putting it all together, the equation becomes:\n\n(27,000,000 - 600P) - (27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q) = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me simplify the left side:\n\n27,000,000 - 600P -27,000,000 + 900P - 3Q = 6,000,000.\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n27,000,000 -27,000,000 = 0.\n\n-600P + 900P = 300P.\n\nAnd then -3Q.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n300P - 3Q = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n300P - 3Q = 6,000,000.\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 3:\n\n100P - Q = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, Q = 100P - 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, so now I have Q in terms of P.

Maybe expanding each term will help, but it's going to take time. Let me try.\n\nFirst term: a\u00b2b.\n\nSecond term: a\u00b2(300 - a - b) = 300a\u00b2 - a\u00b3 - a\u00b2b.\n\nThird term: b\u00b2a.\n\nFourth term: b\u00b2(300 - a - b) = 300b\u00b2 - a b\u00b2 - b\u00b3.\n\nFifth term: (300 - a - b)\u00b2a. Let's expand (300 - a - b)^2:\n\n(300)^2 - 2*300*(a + b) + (a + b)^2 = 90,000 - 600(a + b) + a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2.\n\nMultiply by a:\n\n90,000a - 600a(a + b) + a\u00b3 + 2a\u00b2b + a b\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, sixth term: (300 - a - b)^2b.\n\nSame expansion, multiplied by b:\n\n90,000b - 600b(a + b) + a\u00b2b + 2ab\u00b2 + b\u00b3.\n\nSo now, putting all terms together:\n\na\u00b2b + [300a\u00b2 - a\u00b3 - a\u00b2b] + b\u00b2a + [300b\u00b2 - a b\u00b2 - b\u00b3] + [90,000a - 600a(a + b) + a\u00b3 + 2a\u00b2b + a b\u00b2] + [90,000b - 600b(a + b) + a\u00b2b + 2ab\u00b2 + b\u00b3] = 6,000,000.\n\nNow, let's combine like terms step by step.\n\nFirst, let's collect all the terms:\n\n1. a\u00b2b\n2. 300a\u00b2 - a\u00b3 - a\u00b2b\n3. b\u00b2a\n4. 300b\u00b2 - a b\u00b2 - b\u00b3\n5. 90,000a - 600a(a + b) + a\u00b3 + 2a\u00b2b + a b\u00b2\n6. 90,000b - 600b(a + b) + a\u00b2b + 2ab\u00b2 + b\u00b3\n\nNow, let me write all the terms out:\n\nFrom 1: a\u00b2b\n\nFrom 2: 300a\u00b2 - a\u00b3 - a\u00b2b\n\nFrom 3: a b\u00b2\n\nFrom 4: 300b\u00b2 - a b\u00b2 - b\u00b3\n\nFrom 5: 90,000a - 600a\u00b2 - 600ab + a\u00b3 + 2a\u00b2b + a b\u00b2\n\nFrom 6: 90,000b - 600ab - 600b\u00b2 + a\u00b2b + 2ab\u00b2 + b\u00b3\n\nNow, let's combine all terms:\n\nLet me list each type:\n\n- Constants: 90,000a + 90,000b\n\n- a\u00b3: (-a\u00b3) + a\u00b3 = 0\n\n- b\u00b3: (-b\u00b3) + b\u00b3 = 0\n\n- a\u00b2b: a\u00b2b -a\u00b2b + 2a\u00b2b + a\u00b2b + 2a\u00b2b?",

So, R = 100Q - 2,000,000.\n\nBut R is the product abc, and Q is ab + bc + ac.

For example, if c = 0, then Q = ab + 0 + 0 = ab. Since a + b = 300, the maximum ab is when a = b = 150, so Q_max = 150*150 = 22,500. So, Q can range from 0 to 22,500, but in our case, Q \u2265 20,000.\n\nSo, Q is between 20,000 and 22,500.\n\nSo, 20,000 \u2264 Q \u2264 22,500.\n\nBut since Q must be an integer (as a, b, c are integers), Q can take integer values from 20,000 to 22,500.\n\nBut R must also be an integer because it's abc. So, R = 100Q - 2,000,000 must be an integer, which it will be since Q is integer.\n\nSo, now, for each Q in [20,000, 22,500], we can compute R = 100Q - 2,000,000.

Constant term: -100q = -100Q + 2,000,000.\n\nFrom the constant term:\n\n-100q = -100Q + 2,000,000 => 100q = 100Q - 2,000,000 => q = Q - 20,000.\n\nWhich matches the earlier result.\n\nSo, the quadratic factor is x\u00b2 - 200x + (Q - 20,000).\n\nTherefore, the cubic factors as:\n\n(x - 100)(x\u00b2 - 200x + Q - 20,000) = 0.\n\nSo, the roots are x = 100, and the roots of x\u00b2 - 200x + (Q - 20,000) = 0.\n\nTherefore, the other two roots (say, b and c) must satisfy the quadratic equation:\n\nx\u00b2 - 200x + (Q - 20,000) = 0.\n\nSo, for a = 100, the other two variables b and c must be roots of x\u00b2 - 200x + (Q - 20,000) = 0.\n\nNow, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, the quadratic must have integer roots. So, the discriminant must be a perfect square.\n\nThe discriminant D is:\n\nD = (200)^2 - 4*(1)*(Q - 20,000) = 40,000 - 4Q + 80,000 = 120,000 - 4Q.\n\nThis must be a perfect square. Let me denote D = k\u00b2, where k is a nonnegative integer.\n\nSo, 120,000 - 4Q = k\u00b2\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n4Q = 120,000 - k\u00b2 => Q = (120,000 - k\u00b2)/4 = 30,000 - (k\u00b2)/4\n\nSo, since Q is an integer, k\u00b2 must be divisible by 4, which implies that k is even. Let me set k = 2m, where m is a nonnegative integer.\n\nThen, k\u00b2 = 4m\u00b2, so:\n\nQ = 30,000 - (4m\u00b2)/4 = 30,000 - m\u00b2.\n\nSo, Q = 30,000 - m\u00b2.\n\nBut earlier, we had Q \u2265 20,000, so:\n\n30,000 - m\u00b2 \u2265 20,000 => m\u00b2 \u2264 10,000 => m \u2264 100.\n\nAlso, since Q must be \u2264 22,500 (as discussed earlier), let's check:\n\n30,000 - m\u00b2 \u2264 22,500 => m\u00b2 \u2265 7,500.\n\nSo, m\u00b2 \u2265 7,500 => m \u2265 sqrt(7500) \u2248 86.6025. Since m is integer, m \u2265 87.",

For example, if c = 0, then Q = ab + 0 + 0 = ab. Since a + b = 300, the maximum ab is when a = b = 150, so Q_max = 150*150 = 22,500.

So, R = 100Q - 2,000,000.\n\nBut R is the product abc, and Q is ab + bc + ac. So, we have a relation between Q and R.\n\nNow, in the context of symmetric equations, perhaps I can find possible values of Q that satisfy this equation.\n\nBut I also know that for nonnegative integers a, b, c, Q must be nonnegative, as must R.\n\nSo, 100Q - 2,000,000 \u2265 0 \u2192 Q \u2265 20,000.\n\nAlso, since S = 300, the maximum possible value of Q is when two variables are as large as possible, and the third is zero. For example, if c = 0, then Q = ab + 0 + 0 = ab. Since a + b = 300, the maximum ab is when a = b = 150, so Q_max = 150*150 = 22,500. So, Q can range from 0 to 22,500, but in our case, Q \u2265 20,000.\n\nSo, Q is between 20,000 and 22,500.\n\nSo, 20,000 \u2264 Q \u2264 22,500.\n\nBut since Q must be an integer (as a, b, c are integers), Q can take integer values from 20,000 to 22,500.\n\nBut R must also be an integer because it's abc. So, R = 100Q - 2,000,000 must be an integer, which it will be since Q is integer.\n\nSo, now, for each Q in [20,000, 22,500], we can compute R = 100Q - 2,000,000. Then, we need to find the number of triples (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300, ab + bc + ac = Q, and abc = R.",

For example, if c = 0, then Q = ab + 0 + 0 = ab. Since a + b = 300, the maximum ab is when a = b = 150, so Q_max = 150*150 = 22,500. So, Q can range from 0 to 22,500, but in our case, Q \u2265 20,000.\n\nSo, Q is between 20,000 and 22,500.\n\nSo, 20,000 \u2264 Q \u2264 22,500.\n\nBut since Q must be an integer (as a, b, c are integers), Q can take integer values from 20,000 to 22,500.\n\nBut R must also be an integer because it's abc. So, R = 100Q - 2,000,000 must be an integer, which it will be since Q is integer.\n\nSo, now, for each Q in [20,000, 22,500], we can compute R = 100Q - 2,000,000.

Constant term: -100q = -100Q + 2,000,000.\n\nFrom the constant term:\n\n-100q = -100Q + 2,000,000 => 100q = 100Q - 2,000,000 => q = Q - 20,000.\n\nWhich matches the earlier result.\n\nSo, the quadratic factor is x\u00b2 - 200x + (Q - 20,000).\n\nTherefore, the cubic factors as:\n\n(x - 100)(x\u00b2 - 200x + Q - 20,000) = 0.\n\nSo, the roots are x = 100, and the roots of x\u00b2 - 200x + (Q - 20,000) = 0.\n\nTherefore, the other two roots (say, b and c) must satisfy the quadratic equation:\n\nx\u00b2 - 200x + (Q - 20,000) = 0.\n\nSo, for a = 100, the other two variables b and c must be roots of x\u00b2 - 200x + (Q - 20,000) = 0.\n\nNow, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, the quadratic must have integer roots. So, the discriminant must be a perfect square.\n\nThe discriminant D is:\n\nD = (200)^2 - 4*(1)*(Q - 20,000) = 40,000 - 4Q + 80,000 = 120,000 - 4Q.\n\nThis must be a perfect square. Let me denote D = k\u00b2, where k is a nonnegative integer.\n\nSo, 120,000 - 4Q = k\u00b2\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n4Q = 120,000 - k\u00b2 => Q = (120,000 - k\u00b2)/4 = 30,000 - (k\u00b2)/4\n\nSo, since Q is an integer, k\u00b2 must be divisible by 4, which implies that k is even. Let me set k = 2m, where m is a nonnegative integer.\n\nThen, k\u00b2 = 4m\u00b2, so:\n\nQ = 30,000 - (4m\u00b2)/4 = 30,000 - m\u00b2.\n\nSo, Q = 30,000 - m\u00b2.\n\nBut earlier, we had Q \u2265 20,000, so:\n\n30,000 - m\u00b2 \u2265 20,000 => m\u00b2 \u2264 10,000 => m \u2264 100.\n\nAlso, since Q must be \u2264 22,500 (as discussed earlier), let's check:\n\n30,000 - m\u00b2 \u2264 22,500 => m\u00b2 \u2265 7,500.\n\nSo, m\u00b2 \u2265 7,500 => m \u2265 sqrt(7500) \u2248 86.6025. Since m is integer, m \u2265 87.",

For example, if c = 0, then Q = ab + 0 + 0 = ab. Since a + b = 300, the maximum ab is when a = b = 150, so Q_max = 150*150 = 22,500. So, Q can range from 0 to 22,500, but in our case, Q \u2265 20,000.\n\nSo, Q is between 20,000 and 22,500.\n\nSo, 20,000 \u2264 Q \u2264 22,500.\n\nBut since Q must be an integer (as a, b, c are integers), Q can take integer values from 20,000 to 22,500.\n\nBut R must also be an integer because it's abc. So, R = 100Q - 2,000,000 must be an integer, which it will be since Q is integer.\n\nSo, now, for each Q in [20,000, 22,500], we can compute R = 100Q - 2,000,000.

So, S\u00b3 - 3SP + 3Q becomes:\n\n27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q.\n\nSo putting it all together, the equation becomes:\n\n(27,000,000 - 600P) - (27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q) = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me simplify the left side:\n\n27,000,000 - 600P -27,000,000 + 900P - 3Q = 6,000,000.\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n27,000,000 -27,000,000 = 0.\n\n-600P + 900P = 300P.\n\nAnd then -3Q.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n300P - 3Q = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n300P - 3Q = 6,000,000.\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 3:\n\n100P - Q = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, Q = 100P - 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, so now I have Q in terms of P. Remember that Q is abc, which is the product of the three variables, and P is ab + bc + ca.\n\nNow, I also know that a + b + c = 300, so we're dealing with a system where S = 300, P is ab + bc + ca, and Q is abc.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of triples (a, b, c) with a + b + c = 300, such that abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.",
