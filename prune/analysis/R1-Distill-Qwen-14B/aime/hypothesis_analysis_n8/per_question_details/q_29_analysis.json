Let's write their coordinates:\n\nA: (0,0)\n\nD: (0,16)\n\nH: (x,33)\n\nG: (x + 184,33)\n\nSo, these four points lie on a circle. Let me write the general equation of a circle passing through these four points.\n\nThe general equation of a circle is (X - h)^2 + (Y - k)^2 = r^2, where (h,k) is the center and r is the radius.\n\nWe can plug in the four points into this equation to find h, k, and r. But since it's four points, it should satisfy the circle equation, so we can set up equations.\n\nLet's plug in point A: (0,0):\n\n(0 - h)^2 + (0 - k)^2 = r^2 \u2192 h^2 + k^2 = r^2 ...(1)\n\nPoint D: (0,16):\n\n(0 - h)^2 + (16 - k)^2 = r^2 \u2192 h^2 + (16 - k)^2 = r^2 ...(2)\n\nSubtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n\nh^2 + (16 -k)^2 - [h^2 + k^2] = r^2 - r^2\n\n(16 -k)^2 - k^2 = 0\n\nExpanding (16 -k)^2: 256 -32k +k^2 -k^2 = 256 -32k = 0\n\nSo, 256 -32k =0 \u2192 32k =256 \u2192 k=8.\n\nSo, the y-coordinate of the center is 8.\n\nNow, plug back k=8 into equation (1): h^2 + 8^2 = r^2 \u2192 h^2 +64 = r^2 ...(1a)\n\nNow, let's plug in point H: (x,33):\n\n(x - h)^2 + (33 -8)^2 = r^2 \u2192 (x - h)^2 + 25^2 = r^2 \u2192 (x - h)^2 + 625 = r^2 ...(3)\n\nSimilarly, plug in point G: (x + 184,33):\n\n(x +184 - h)^2 + (33 -8)^2 = r^2 \u2192 (x +184 - h)^2 +625 = r^2 ...(4)\n\nSubtract equation (3) from equation (4):\n\n[(x +184 -h)^2 +625] - [(x - h)^2 +625] = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(x +184 -h)^2 - (x -h)^2 = 0\n\nExpand both squares:\n\n= [x^2 + 2*(184 -h)*x + (184 -h)^2] - [x^2 -2h*x + h^2] \n\n= x^2 + (368 - 2h)x + (184 -h)^2 - x^2 + 2h x - h^2\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (368 - 2h + 2h)x + (184 -h)^2 - h^2\n\n= 368x + [ (184)^2 - 2*184*h + h^2 - h^2 ]\n\n= 368x + (184)^2 - 368h\n\nSo, 368x + 33856 -368h =0\n\nFactor 368:\n\n368(x - h) +33856 =0",
