Similarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) and argument -\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (1 + i) = sqrt(2) * e^{i \u03c0/4}, and (1 - i) = sqrt(2) * e^{-i \u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13 first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}\n\nNow, let's compute e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}. Since 13\u03c0/4 is more than 2\u03c0, we can subtract 2\u03c0 multiples to find the equivalent angle.\n\n13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Because 3*2\u03c0 = 6\u03c0, which is 12\u03c0/4. So 13\u03c0/4 - 3\u03c0 = \u03c0/4. But 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.",

The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is \u03c0/4 radians, since it's in the first quadrant, 45 degrees.\n\nSo, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.

Let's compute that modulo 2\u03c0.\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 = (12 + 1) * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0 (since 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0). So, 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, for the negative angle: 13 * (-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4. Adding 2\u03c0 until it's within [0, 2\u03c0). Let's compute:\n\n-13\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4) = (-5\u03c0/4). Still negative. Add 2\u03c0 again: (-5\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4) = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i 5\u03c0/4} = e^{i 3\u03c0/4}.",

So, yes, x^13 - 1 = Product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k).\n\nTherefore, if I set x = (1 + i), then the product over k=0 to 12 of ( (1 + i) - \u03c9^k ) is equal to (1 + i)^13 - 1. Similarly, the product over k=0 to 12 of ( (1 - i) - \u03c9^k ) is equal to (1 - i)^13 - 1.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the original product is equal to [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] multiplied by [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].\n\nSo now, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, subtract 1 from each, multiply them together, and then find the result modulo 1000.\n\nAlright, let's compute (1 + i)^13 first.

Similarly for z = 1 - i.\n\nSo, our product P is equal to [(1 + i)^13 - 1] * [(1 - i)^13 - 1].\n\nSo, now, I need to compute [(1 + i)^13 - 1] * [(1 - i)^13 - 1], and then find the remainder when this number is divided by 1000.\n\nAlright, let's compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nFirst, note that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is \u03c0/4 radians, since it's in the first quadrant, 45 degrees.\n\nSo, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}. Similarly, 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, let's compute (sqrt(2))^13. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNext, the angles: 13 * \u03c0/4. Let's compute that modulo 2\u03c0.\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 = (12 + 1) * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0 (since 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0). So, 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, for the negative angle: 13 * (-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4. Adding 2\u03c0 until it's within [0, 2\u03c0). Let's compute:\n\n-13\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4) = (-5\u03c0/4). Still negative. Add 2\u03c0 again: (-5\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4) = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i 5\u03c0/4} = e^{i 3\u03c0/4}.",

So, yes, x^13 - 1 = Product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k).\n\nTherefore, if I set x = (1 + i), then the product over k=0 to 12 of ( (1 + i) - \u03c9^k ) is equal to (1 + i)^13 - 1. Similarly, the product over k=0 to 12 of ( (1 - i) - \u03c9^k ) is equal to (1 - i)^13 - 1.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the original product is equal to [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] multiplied by [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].\n\nSo now, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, subtract 1 from each, multiply them together, and then find the result modulo 1000.\n\nAlright, let's compute (1 + i)^13 first. I know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. Let's calculate its magnitude and argument.\n\nThe magnitude of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is arctan(1/1) = \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}. Therefore, (1 + i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{i n \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) has the same magnitude, sqrt(2), and its argument is -\u03c0/4, so (1 - i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{-i n \u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, for n =13,\n\n(1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i *13*(\u03c0/4)}.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n(1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i *13*(\u03c0/4)}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13 first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let's compute the angles. 13*(\u03c0/4) = (13/4)\u03c0 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But angles are periodic modulo 2\u03c0, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 is equivalent to \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.",

Similarly, the product over k=0 to 12 of ( (1 - i) - \u03c9^k ) is equal to (1 - i)^13 - 1.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the original product is equal to [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] multiplied by [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].\n\nSo now, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, subtract 1 from each, multiply them together, and then find the result modulo 1000.\n\nAlright, let's compute (1 + i)^13 first. I know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. Let's calculate its magnitude and argument.\n\nThe magnitude of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is arctan(1/1) = \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}. Therefore, (1 + i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{i n \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) has the same magnitude, sqrt(2), and its argument is -\u03c0/4, so (1 - i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{-i n \u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, for n =13,\n\n(1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i *13*(\u03c0/4)}.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n(1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i *13*(\u03c0/4)}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13 first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let's compute the angles. 13*(\u03c0/4) = (13/4)\u03c0 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But angles are periodic modulo 2\u03c0, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 is equivalent to \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.",

So, substituting z = 1 + i, we get \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (1 + i - \u03c9^k) = (1 + i)^13 - 1. Similarly for z = 1 - i.\n\nSo, our product P is equal to [(1 + i)^13 - 1] * [(1 - i)^13 - 1].\n\nSo, now, I need to compute [(1 + i)^13 - 1] * [(1 - i)^13 - 1], and then find the remainder when this number is divided by 1000.\n\nAlright, let's compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nFirst, note that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is \u03c0/4 radians, since it's in the first quadrant, 45 degrees.\n\nSo, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}. Similarly, 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, let's compute (sqrt(2))^13. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNext, the angles: 13 * \u03c0/4. Let's compute that modulo 2\u03c0.\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 = (12 + 1) * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0 (since 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0). So, 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, for the negative angle: 13 * (-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4. Adding 2\u03c0 until it's within [0, 2\u03c0). Let's compute:\n\n-13\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4) = (-5\u03c0/4). Still negative. Add 2\u03c0 again: (-5\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4) = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i 5\u03c0/4} = e^{i 3\u03c0/4}.",

So, yes, x^13 - 1 = Product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k).\n\nTherefore, if I set x = (1 + i), then the product over k=0 to 12 of ( (1 + i) - \u03c9^k ) is equal to (1 + i)^13 - 1. Similarly, the product over k=0 to 12 of ( (1 - i) - \u03c9^k ) is equal to (1 - i)^13 - 1.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the original product is equal to [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] multiplied by [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].\n\nSo now, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, subtract 1 from each, multiply them together, and then find the result modulo 1000.\n\nAlright, let's compute (1 + i)^13 first. I know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. Let's calculate its magnitude and argument.\n\nThe magnitude of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is arctan(1/1) = \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}. Therefore, (1 + i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{i n \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) has the same magnitude, sqrt(2), and its argument is -\u03c0/4, so (1 - i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{-i n \u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, for n =13,\n\n(1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i *13*(\u03c0/4)}.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n(1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i *13*(\u03c0/4)}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13 first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let's compute the angles. 13*(\u03c0/4) = (13/4)\u03c0 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4.

So, my calculation should be correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let me recompute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\n(1 + i) has magnitude sqrt(2), angle \u03c0/4.\n\n(1 + i)^13: (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nAngle: 13 * \u03c0/4 = (3*4 + 1)*\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. So, subtract 2\u03c0 to get 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) [cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)] = 64*sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nMultiplying, 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = -64. Similarly, the imaginary part is -64i.\n\nSame for (1 - i)^13: angle is -\u03c0/4, so 13 * (-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4. Adding 4\u03c0 to get a positive angle: -13\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4 = (-5\u03c0/4) + 8\u03c0/4 = (3\u03c0)/4.",

Similarly, e^{i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) +i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -\u221a2/2 -i\u221a2/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) -i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -\u221a2/2 +i\u221a2/2.\n\nTherefore, \u03b1^13 =64 sqrt(2) [ -\u221a2/2 -i\u221a2/2 ].\n\nCompute this:\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2) =64 * (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)/2) * (-1) =64*(2/2)*(-1)=64*(-1)= -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part:\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-i\u221a2/2) =64 * (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)/2)*(-i) =64*(2/2)*(-i) = -64i.\n\nSo, \u03b1^13 = -64 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, \u03b2^13 =64 sqrt(2) [ -\u221a2/2 +i\u221a2/2 ].\n\nCompute this:\n\n64 sqrt(2)*(-\u221a2/2) = same as above, -64.\n\nImaginary part:\n\n64 sqrt(2)*(i\u221a2/2) =64*(2/2)*i =64i.\n\nSo, \u03b2^13 = -64 +64i.\n\nTherefore, \u03b1^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, \u03b2^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nNow, compute the product (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1) = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i).\n\nThis is a product of complex conjugates, so it's equal to (-65)^2 - (64i)^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(-65)^2 =4225.\n\n(64i)^2 = (64)^2 * i^2 =4096*(-1)= -4096.\n\nSo, the product is 4225 - (-4096) =4225 +4096 =8321.\n\nSo, the product over k=0 to 12 of (2 -2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k})=8321.",

So, substituting z = 1 + i, we get \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (1 + i - \u03c9^k) = (1 + i)^13 - 1. Similarly for z = 1 - i.\n\nSo, our product P is equal to [(1 + i)^13 - 1] * [(1 - i)^13 - 1].\n\nSo, now, I need to compute [(1 + i)^13 - 1] * [(1 - i)^13 - 1], and then find the remainder when this number is divided by 1000.\n\nAlright, let's compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nFirst, note that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is \u03c0/4 radians, since it's in the first quadrant, 45 degrees.\n\nSo, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}. Similarly, 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, let's compute (sqrt(2))^13. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNext, the angles: 13 * \u03c0/4. Let's compute that modulo 2\u03c0.\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 = (12 + 1) * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0 (since 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0). So, 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, for the negative angle: 13 * (-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4. Adding 2\u03c0 until it's within [0, 2\u03c0). Let's compute:\n\n-13\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4) = (-5\u03c0/4). Still negative. Add 2\u03c0 again: (-5\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4) = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i 5\u03c0/4} = e^{i 3\u03c0/4}.",

So, yes, x^13 - 1 = Product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k).\n\nTherefore, if I set x = (1 + i), then the product over k=0 to 12 of ( (1 + i) - \u03c9^k ) is equal to (1 + i)^13 - 1. Similarly, the product over k=0 to 12 of ( (1 - i) - \u03c9^k ) is equal to (1 - i)^13 - 1.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the original product is equal to [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] multiplied by [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].\n\nSo now, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, subtract 1 from each, multiply them together, and then find the result modulo 1000.\n\nAlright, let's compute (1 + i)^13 first. I know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. Let's calculate its magnitude and argument.\n\nThe magnitude of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is arctan(1/1) = \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}. Therefore, (1 + i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{i n \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) has the same magnitude, sqrt(2), and its argument is -\u03c0/4, so (1 - i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{-i n \u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, for n =13,\n\n(1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i *13*(\u03c0/4)}.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n(1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i *13*(\u03c0/4)}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13 first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let's compute the angles. 13*(\u03c0/4) = (13/4)\u03c0 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4.

So, that's why the product is 1 * product from k=1 to12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nBut in my approach, I included the k=0 term as part of the product, but it's 1, so it doesn't change the product. So, my calculation should be correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let me recompute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\n(1 + i) has magnitude sqrt(2), angle \u03c0/4.\n\n(1 + i)^13: (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nAngle: 13 * \u03c0/4 = (3*4 + 1)*\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. So, subtract 2\u03c0 to get 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) [cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)] = 64*sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nMultiplying, 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = -64. Similarly, the imaginary part is -64i.\n\nSame for (1 - i)^13: angle is -\u03c0/4, so 13 * (-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4. Adding 4\u03c0 to get a positive angle: -13\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4 = (-5\u03c0/4) + 8\u03c0/4 = (3\u03c0)/4.",

Then, the product over k=0 to 12 of these terms is the product over these two terms, each evaluated at \u03c9^k. Then, I used the fact that product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 -1, so product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = 1 - a^13, which I think is correct because flipping the terms introduces a sign change due to the (-1)^13 factor.\n\nThen, I computed (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 using polar form. (1 + i) has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4. So, (1 + i)^13 is (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i13\u03c0/4}.\n\n13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Subtracting 2\u03c0 gives 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2. Then multiplied by (sqrt(2))^13, which is 2^(13/2) = 8*2^(1/2)*2^5 =",

The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is \u03c0/4 radians, since it's in the first quadrant, 45 degrees.\n\nSo, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.

So, 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, for the negative angle: 13 * (-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4. Adding 2\u03c0 until it's within [0, 2\u03c0). Let's compute:\n\n-13\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4) = (-5\u03c0/4). Still negative. Add 2\u03c0 again: (-5\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4) = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i 5\u03c0/4} = e^{i 3\u03c0/4}.",

So, yes, x^13 - 1 = Product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k).\n\nTherefore, if I set x = (1 + i), then the product over k=0 to 12 of ( (1 + i) - \u03c9^k ) is equal to (1 + i)^13 - 1. Similarly, the product over k=0 to 12 of ( (1 - i) - \u03c9^k ) is equal to (1 - i)^13 - 1.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the original product is equal to [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] multiplied by [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].\n\nSo now, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, subtract 1 from each, multiply them together, and then find the result modulo 1000.\n\nAlright, let's compute (1 + i)^13 first. I know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. Let's calculate its magnitude and argument.\n\nThe magnitude of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2).

So, \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = - [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ].\n\nSimilarly, \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = - [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].\n\nTherefore, the entire product P is equal to:\n\nP = [ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ] = [ - (A - 1) ] * [ - (B - 1) ] where A = (1 + i)^13 and B = (1 - i)^13.\n\nSimplify this expression:\n\n= (-1)*(A - 1)*(-1)*(B - 1) = (A - 1)(B - 1).\n\nSo, P = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ).\n\nNow, I need to compute A = (1 + i)^13 and B = (1 - i)^13.\n\nI remember that 1 + i can be represented in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13 first. Since sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} and e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\n13\u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is equivalent to \u03c0/4 in the third revolution, but since angles are modulo 2\u03c0, 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 * 1 + \u03c0/2.",

So, in this case, if I have the product over k=0 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k), that's equal to x^13 - 1.\n\nBut in our case, the products are (\u03c9^k - a), where a is a constant. So, that's the same as (-1)^13 * (a - \u03c9^k). Because (\u03c9^k - a) = - (a - \u03c9^k). So, the product becomes (-1)^13 * \u220f (a - \u03c9^k) = (-1)^13 * (a^13 - 1), since \u220f (a - \u03c9^k) = a^13 - 1.\n\nSo, for our case, where a is (1 + i), the product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) is equal to (-1)^13 * [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ].\n\nSimilarly, \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = (-1)^13 * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].\n\nTherefore, P = [ (-1)^13 * ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ (-1)^13 * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ]\n\nSince (-1)^13 is -1, so:\n\nP = ( (-1) * ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ) * ( (-1) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) )\n\nMultiplying these together:\n\nP = (-1) * (-1) * [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ]\n\nSo, (-1)*(-1) is 1, so:\n\nP = [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ]\n\nNow, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13. Let me recall that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(2), and its argument is \u03c0/4 radians. Similarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) and argument -\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (1 + i) = sqrt(2) * e^{i \u03c0/4}, and (1 - i) = sqrt(2) * e^{-i \u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13 first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}\n\nNow, let's compute e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}. Since 13\u03c0/4 is more than 2\u03c0, we can subtract 2\u03c0 multiples to find the equivalent angle.\n\n13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Because 3*2\u03c0 = 6\u03c0, which is 12\u03c0/4. So 13\u03c0/4 - 3\u03c0 = \u03c0/4. But 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.",
