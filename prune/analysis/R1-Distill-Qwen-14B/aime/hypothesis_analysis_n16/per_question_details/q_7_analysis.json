The number of proper colorings is 2, but in our case, we need exactly 4 red and 4 blue. So, for the cycle of length 8, the number of proper 2-colorings with equal numbers of red and blue is 2. Because in a cycle of even length, the two colorings are the two possible alternating colorings.\n\nSimilarly, for k=2, the graph consists of two cycles of length 4. Each cycle can be colored in 2 ways, so the total number of colorings is 2*2=4. But again, we need exactly 4 red and 4 blue. Each cycle of length 4 in the graph (for k=2) has two red and two blue. So, the number of colorings where each 4-cycle has two red and two blue is 2 for each cycle. So, total colorings would be 2*2=4, but we need exactly 4 red and 4 blue in total. However, each 4-cycle contributes two red and two blue, so overall, 4 red and 4 blue. So, all 4 colorings satisfy the condition. Therefore, for k=2, there are 4 colorings.\n\nSimilarly, for k=3, the graph is a single cycle of length 8, same as k=1. So, the number of colorings where color(i) \u2260 color(i+3) for all i, and exactly 4 red and 4 blue, is 2.\n\nFor k=4, the graph is four separate edges (each connecting i and i+4). So, each edge must have one red and one blue. Each edge has two choices. So, the total number of colorings is 2^4=16. But we need exactly 4 red and 4 blue. Since each edge contributes one red and one blue, the total is 4 red and 4 blue. So, all 16 colorings satisfy the condition. So, for k=4, there are 16 colorings.\n\nFor k=5,6,7: These are equivalent to k=3,2,1 respectively because shifting by 5 is equivalent to shifting by -3, which is the same as shifting by 3 in the other direction. Similarly for others. So, the number of colorings for k=5 is the same as for k=3, which is 2. Similarly, for k=6, same as k=2, which is 4. For k=7, same as k=1, which is 2.\n\nNow, let's summarize:\n\nFor each k from 0 to 7:\n\n- k=0: Not possible, as that would require R=B, which isn't allowed.\n\n- k=1: 2 colorings\n\n- k=2: 4 colorings\n\n- k=3: 2 colorings\n\n- k=4: 16 colorings\n\n- k=5: 2 colorings\n\n- k=6: 4 colorings\n\n- k=7: 2 colorings\n\nNow, summing these up: 2+4+2+16+2+4+2 = 32.",

The number of proper colorings is 2, but in our case, we need exactly 4 red and 4 blue. So, for the cycle of length 8, the number of proper 2-colorings with equal numbers of red and blue is 2. Because in a cycle of even length, the two colorings are the two possible alternating colorings.\n\nSimilarly, for k=2, the graph consists of two cycles of length 4. Each cycle can be colored in 2 ways, so the total number of colorings is 2*2=4. But again, we need exactly 4 red and 4 blue. Each cycle of length 4 in the graph (for k=2) has two red and two blue. So, the number of colorings where each 4-cycle has two red and two blue is 2 for each cycle. So, total colorings would be 2*2=4, but we need exactly 4 red and 4 blue in total. However, each 4-cycle contributes two red and two blue, so overall, 4 red and 4 blue. So, all 4 colorings satisfy the condition. Therefore, for k=2, there are 4 colorings.\n\nSimilarly, for k=3, the graph is a single cycle of length 8, same as k=1. So, the number of colorings where color(i) \u2260 color(i+3) for all i, and exactly 4 red and 4 blue, is 2.\n\nFor k=4, the graph is four separate edges (each connecting i and i+4). So, each edge must have one red and one blue. Each edge has two choices. So, the total number of colorings is 2^4=16. But we need exactly 4 red and 4 blue. Since each edge contributes one red and one blue, the total is 4 red and 4 blue. So, all 16 colorings satisfy the condition. So, for k=4, there are 16 colorings.\n\nFor k=5,6,7: These are equivalent to k=3,2,1 respectively because shifting by 5 is equivalent to shifting by -3, which is the same as shifting by 3 in the other direction.
