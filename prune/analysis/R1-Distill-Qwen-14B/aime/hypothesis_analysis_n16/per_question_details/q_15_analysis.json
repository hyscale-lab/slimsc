Let me think.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to handle both cases separately and then add them together.\n\nSo, for each case:\n\nCase 1: Path starts with R, has four direction changes, so five runs total: R, U, R, U, R. So, three R runs and two U runs.\n\nCase 2: Path starts with U, has four direction changes, so five runs total: U, R, U, R, U. So, three U runs and two R runs.\n\nNow, in each case, the number of R moves and U moves must add up to 8 each. Because the total number of right moves is 8, and the total number of up moves is 8.\n\nSo, for Case 1: three R runs and two U runs. The sum of the lengths of the R runs is 8, and the sum of the lengths of the U runs is 8.\n\nSimilarly for Case 2: three U runs and two R runs, same sums.\n\nSo, I can model each case as distributing the 8 R moves into three runs, each run being at least 1, and similarly distributing the 8 U moves into two runs, each run being at least 1.",

So, the number of R steps is 8 and the number of U steps is 8.\n\nIn the path with five runs, whether it starts with R or U, the number of runs in each direction will determine how the 8 R's and 8 U's are distributed.\n\nLet's think about the structure of the path.\n\nIf the path starts with R, then the runs are R, U, R, U, R.

Each R run has a certain number of R's, and each U run has a certain number of U's. Similarly for starting with U.\n\nBut the total R's must sum to 8, and the total U's must sum to 8.\n\nFor the first case (starting with R):\n\nNumber of R runs: 3 (R1, R2, R3)\nNumber of U runs: 2 (U1, U2)\n\nSo, the R's are distributed among the three runs: R1 + R2 + R3 = 8\nSimilarly, U's: U1 + U2 = 8\n\nEach R run must have at least 1 R, and each U run must have at least 1 U. Because you can't have a run of zero steps; that would mean the direction didn't change. So, each run must have at least one step.\n\nSimilarly, for the second case (starting with U):\n\nNumber of U runs: 3 (U1, U2, U3)\nNumber of R runs: 2 (R1, R2)\n\nSo, U1 + U2 + U3 =8 and R1 + R2 =8, with each run having at least 1.\n\nSo, the number of ways for each case is the number of ways to distribute the steps into the runs.\n\nThis is a classic stars and bars problem.\n\nFor the first case, distributing 8 R's into 3 runs: the number of ways is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21.

So, the number of R steps is 8 and the number of U steps is 8.\n\nIn the path with five runs, whether it starts with R or U, the number of runs in each direction will determine how the 8 R's and 8 U's are distributed.\n\nLet's think about the structure of the path.\n\nIf the path starts with R, then the runs are R, U, R, U, R. So, there are three R runs and two U runs.\n\nSimilarly, if it starts with U, the runs are U, R, U, R, U: three U runs and two R runs.\n\nIn both cases, the number of runs is five, and the direction changes are four.\n\nSo, I need to calculate the number of such paths for both cases and add them together.\n\nLet me formalize this.\n\nLet me denote the runs for starting with R as R1, U1, R2, U2, R3. Each R run has a certain number of R's, and each U run has a certain number of U's. Similarly for starting with U.\n\nBut the total R's must sum to 8, and the total U's must sum to 8.\n\nFor the first case (starting with R):\n\nNumber of R runs: 3 (R1, R2, R3)\nNumber of U runs: 2 (U1, U2)\n\nSo, the R's are distributed among the three runs: R1 + R2 + R3 = 8\nSimilarly, U's: U1 + U2 = 8\n\nEach R run must have at least 1 R, and each U run must have at least 1 U. Because you can't have a run of zero steps; that would mean the direction didn't change. So, each run must have at least one step.\n\nSimilarly, for the second case (starting with U):\n\nNumber of U runs: 3 (U1, U2, U3)\nNumber of R runs: 2 (R1, R2)\n\nSo, U1 + U2 + U3 =8 and R1 + R2 =8, with each run having at least 1.\n\nSo, the number of ways for each case is the number of ways to distribute the steps into the runs.\n\nThis is a classic stars and bars problem.\n\nFor the first case, distributing 8 R's into 3 runs: the number of ways is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21. Similarly, distributing 8 U's into 2 runs: C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1) =7.\n\nSo, the number of paths starting with R is 21 *7 = 147.\n\nSimilarly, for the second case, distributing 8 U's into 3 runs: C(7,2) =21, and distributing 8 R's into 2 runs: C(7,1)=7. So, the number of paths starting with U is also 21 *7 =147.\n\nTherefore, total number of paths would be 147 +147=294.",
