So, in the triangle OIA, angle at I is 90 degrees. So triangle OIA is right-angled at I.\n\nSo, in triangle OIA, OA is the distance from O to A, which is the circumradius, so OA = R =13.

It's a system of equations; perhaps I can solve for one variable in terms of the other.\n\nLet me try to manipulate equation 2.\n\nFirst, equation 2:\n\nsqrt(30) xy - 39x - 39y = 156 sqrt(30).\n\nI can factor out 39 from the linear terms:\n\nsqrt(30)xy - 39(x + y) = 156 sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, perhaps I can express this as:\n\nsqrt(30)xy = 39(x + y) + 156 sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can express x + y and xy in terms of other variables.\n\nLet me denote S = x + y and P = xy.\n\nThen equation 2 becomes:\n\nsqrt(30) P - 39 S = 156 sqrt(30).\n\nEquation 1: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - (14/13)xy = 480.\n\nBut x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy = S\u00b2 - 2P.\n\nSo, equation 1 becomes:\n\nS\u00b2 - 2P - (14/13) P = 480.\n\nSimplify:\n\nS\u00b2 - (2 + 14/13) P = 480 \u2192 S\u00b2 - (30/13) P = 480.\n\nSo now we have:\n\nEquation 1: S\u00b2 - (30/13) P = 480.\n\nEquation 2: sqrt(30) P - 39 S = 156 sqrt(30).\n\nLet me try to solve these equations. From equation 2, I can express P in terms of S.\n\nsqrt(30) P = 39 S + 156 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, P = (39 S + 156 sqrt(30)) / sqrt(30).\n\nSimplify this:\n\nP = (39 S)/sqrt(30) + 156 sqrt(30)/sqrt(30).\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n156 sqrt(30)/sqrt(30) = 156.\n\nAnd 39 / sqrt(30) can be rationalized as (39 sqrt(30))/30 = (13 sqrt(30))/10.\n\nSo, P = (13 sqrt(30)/10) S + 156.\n\nNow, substitute this expression for P into equation 1:\n\nS\u00b2 - (30/13) [ (13 sqrt(30)/10) S + 156 ] = 480.\n\nLet me compute the term (30/13) multiplied by each part inside the brackets.\n\nFirst, (30/13)*(13 sqrt(30)/10) S = (30/13)*(13 sqrt(30)/10) S = (30 * 13 sqrt(30)) / (13*10) ) S = (30 /10) sqrt(30) S = 3 sqrt(30) S.\n\nSecond, (30/13)*156 = (30 *156)/13 = 30 * 12 = 360.\n\nSo, equation 1 becomes:\n\nS\u00b2 - [ 3 sqrt(30) S + 360 ] = 480.\n\nSimplify:\n\nS\u00b2 -3 sqrt(30) S - 360 = 480.\n\nBring 480 to the left:\n\nS\u00b2 -3 sqrt(30) S - 840 = 0.\n\nSo, now we have a quadratic equation in terms of S:\n\nS\u00b2 - 3 sqrt(30) S - 840 = 0.\n\nLet me solve for S using the quadratic formula.\n\nS = [3 sqrt(30) \u00b1 sqrt( (3 sqrt(30))\u00b2 + 4*1*840 )]/2.\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n(3 sqrt(30))\u00b2 = 9*30 = 270.\n\n4*1*840 = 3360.\n\nSo, sqrt(270 + 3360) = sqrt(3630).\n\nHmm, sqrt(3630). Let's factor 3630:\n\n3630 = 10 * 363 = 10 * 3 * 121 = 10 * 3 * 11\u00b2.\n\nSo sqrt(3630) = sqrt(10 * 3 * 11\u00b2) )= 11 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, sqrt(3630) = 11 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, S = [3 sqrt(30) \u00b1 11 sqrt(30)] / 2.\n\nWe have two possibilities:\n\n1) S = (3 sqrt(30) + 11 sqrt(30))/2 = (14 sqrt(30))/2 = 7 sqrt(30).\n\n2) S = (3 sqrt(30) - 11 sqrt(30))/2 = (-8 sqrt(30))/2 = -4 sqrt(30).\n\nBut since S is the sum of sides b and c, it must be positive. So, S = 7 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, we have S = 7 sqrt(30).\n\nNow, let's find P from earlier:\n\nP = (13 sqrt(30)/10) S + 156.\n\nPlugging in S =7 sqrt(30):\n\nP = (13 sqrt(30)/10)*(7 sqrt(30)) + 156.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (13 sqrt(30)/10)*(7 sqrt(30)) = (13*7)*(sqrt(30)*sqrt(30))/10 = 91*(30)/10 = 91*3=273.\n\nSo, P = 273 + 156 = 429.\n\nSo, P = 429.\n\nSince P is the product of b and c, which are sides AB and AC, so AB*AC = 429.",
