          "text2": "Wait, the problem gives me the number of people owning exactly two items as 437, and exactly three as 234.\n\nHmm, the number of people owning exactly two is the sum of the pairwise intersections minus three times the triple intersection. Because each pairwise intersection includes those who have exactly two and those who have all three. So, |D \u2229 G| includes those who have D, G, and S as well.

(sum of pairwise) - x = 224\n2. (sum of pairwise) - 3x = 437\n\nLet me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n[(sum pairwise) -3x] - [(sum pairwise) -x] = 437 - 224\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(-3x + x) = 213\n\n-2x = 213\n\nSo, x = 213 / (-2) = -106.5",

So:\n\ny + 437 + 234 + x = 900.\n\nSo y + x = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nSo y + x = 229. So that's one equation.\n\nBut we need more equations to find x. Let's look at the counts for D, G, S.\n\nThe total number of residents owning D is 195. This includes:\n\n- Only D: but wait, no, since everyone has C. So the residents owning D are those in C&D, C&D&G, C&D&S, and C&D&G&S.\n\nSo |D| = (C&D) + (C&D&G) + (C&D&S) + x.\n\nSimilarly, for G:\n\n|G| = (C&G) + (C&D&G) + (C&G&S) + x.\n\nAnd for S:\n\n|S| = (C&S) + (C&D&S) + (C&G&S) + x.\n\nSo let me denote:\n\nLet me define variables:\n\nLet me call:\n\na = C&D (only C and D)\nb = C&G (only C and G)\nc = C&S (only C and S)\n\nd = C&D&G (only C, D, G)\ne = C&D&S (only C, D, S)\nf = C&G&S (only C, G, S)\n\ng = C&D&G&S (all four, which is x)\n\nSo, the number of residents with exactly two things is a + b + c = 437.\n\nThe number with exactly three things is d + e + f = 234.\n\nThe number with all four is g = x.\n\nThe number with exactly one thing (only C) is y.\n\nSo total residents: y + (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) + g = 900.\n\nWhich gives y + 437 + 234 + x = 900 \u2192 y + x = 229.\n\nNow, the counts for D, G, S:\n\nD's total is a + d + e + g = 195.\n\nSimilarly, G's total is b + d + f + g = 367.\n\nS's total is c + e + f + g = 562.\n\nSo we have three equations:\n\n1. a + d + e + g = 195\n\n2. b + d + f + g = 367\n\n3. c + e + f + g = 562\n\nWe also know that:\n\na + b + c = 437\n\nd + e + f = 234\n\ny + x = 229\n\nWe have variables: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, y, x.\n\nBut that's a lot of variables. Maybe we can express some variables in terms of others.\n\nLet me see: from the first three equations, we can perhaps add them together.\n\nAdding equations 1, 2, 3:\n\n(a + d + e + g) + (b + d + f + g) + (c + e + f + g) = 195 + 367 + 562.\n\nLet me compute the right-hand side: 195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124.\n\nLeft side: a + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f + 3g.\n\nBecause:\n\na + b + c,\n\nd appears twice (in equations 1 and 2),\n\ne appears twice (equations 1 and 3),\n\nf appears twice (equations 2 and 3),\n\ng appears three times (all three equations).\n\nSo,\n\na + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f + 3g = 1124.\n\nBut from earlier, we know that a + b + c = 437,\n\nand d + e + f = 234.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n437 + 2*(d + e + f) + 3g = 1124.\n\nBecause 2d + 2e + 2f = 2*(d+e+f).\n\nSo,\n\n437 + 2*(234) + 3g = 1124.\n\nCompute 2*234: 468.\n\nSo,\n\n437 + 468 + 3g = 1124.\n\n437 + 468 = 905.\n\nSo,\n\n905 + 3g = 1124.\n\nSubtract 905 from both sides:\n\n3g = 1124 - 905 = 219.\n\nSo,\n\ng = 219 / 3 = 73.\n\nSo g is 73.",

So, c = 234.\n\nd = number with exactly four items: C plus all three others. So, d is what we're trying to find.\n\nSo, a + b + c + d = 900.\n\nBut we don't know a. Hmm. So, how else can we approach this?\n\nWe also know the total number of owners for each item. Let's think about how these numbers relate.\n\nEach of the D, G, S is a subset of the residents, with the counts given.\n\nSo, |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562.\n\nBut each of these includes people who own those items plus possibly others (C and/or the other two items).\n\nSo, the total number of owners for each item is equal to the number of people who have exactly that item plus C, plus those who have that item plus two others, plus those who have all three others plus C.",

          "text1": "Wait, the problem says 437 own exactly two of the four items (which includes C), and 234 own exactly three of the four (which includes C).\n\nSo, the 437 includes people who own C and exactly one of D, G, or S.\n\nSimilarly, the 234 includes people who own C and exactly two of D, G, S.\n\nAnd the x (number of people owning all four) is the same as the number of people who own all three of D, G, S, since C is already included.\n\nSo, let me model this.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- a: number of people who own exactly C and D \u2192 exactly two items.\n\n- b: exactly C and G \u2192 exactly two.\n\n- c: exactly C and S \u2192 exactly two.\n\n- d: exactly C, D, G \u2192 exactly three.\n\n- e: exactly C, D, S \u2192 exactly three.\n\n- f: exactly C, G, S \u2192 exactly three.\n\n- g: exactly C, D, G, S \u2192 exactly four.\n\nSo, the total number of people is a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 900.\n\nThe problem states:\n\na + b + c = 437 (exactly two items).\n\nd + e + f = 234 (exactly three items).\n\nWe need to find g.\n\nSo, from the total:\n\n437 + 234 + g = 900 \u2192 671 + g = 900 \u2192 g = 229.\n\nSo, the number of people who own all four items is 229.",
          "text2": "Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think again.\n\nEach person owns C plus some combination of D, G, S.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- x = number of people with exactly C only: own only C, so 1 item.\n\n- y = number with exactly C and D: so 2 items.\n\n- z = number with exactly C and G: 2 items.\n\n- w = number with exactly C and S: 2 items.\n\n- a = number with exactly C, D, G: 3 items.\n\n- b = number with exactly C, D, S: 3 items.\n\n- c = number with exactly C, G, S: 3 items.\n\n- d = number with all four: C, D, G, S: 4 items.\n\nSo, according to the problem, the number of people owning exactly two is y + z + w = 437.\n\nThe number owning exactly three is a + b + c = 234.\n\nAnd the number owning all four is d, which is what we're trying to find.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the people:\n\nx + y + z + w + a + b + c + d = 900.\n\nBut we don't know x. Hmm.\n\nBut perhaps we can relate the counts of D, G, S to these variables.\n\nEach of D, G, S counts the number of people who have that item. So, for example:\n\nn(D) = number of people who own D. That includes those with exactly C and D (y), exactly C, D, G (a), exactly C, D, S (b), and all four (d). So,\n\nn(D) = y + a + b + d = 195.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nn(G) = z + a + c + d = 367.\n\nn(S) = w + b + c + d = 562.\n\nAdditionally, the sum of pairwise intersections would be:\n\nn(D\u2229G) = y + a + b + d?",
