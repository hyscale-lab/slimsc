Let's see if we can express a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 in terms of (a + b)^2.\n\nWe know that a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = (a + b)^2 - 2ab.\n\nSo, let's substitute that in:\n\n3ab(a + b) -300[(a + b)^2 - 2ab] -1200ab + 90,000(a + b) = 6,000,000.\n\nExpanding:\n\n3ab(a + b) -300(a + b)^2 + 600ab -1200ab +90,000(a + b) = 6,000,000.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n-300(a + b)^2.\n\n3ab(a + b) + (600ab -1200ab) = 3ab(a + b) -600ab.\n\nAnd 90,000(a + b).\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n-300(a + b)^2 + 3ab(a + b) -600ab + 90,000(a + b) = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me denote s = a + b. Since c = 300 - s, and since a and b are nonnegative, s can range from 0 to 300.\n\nSo, s = a + b, and c = 300 - s.\n\nAlso, let me denote t = ab.\n\nThen, substituting s and t into the equation:\n\n-300s\u00b2 + 3t s -600t +90,000s =6,000,000.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n-300s\u00b2 + 3ts -600t +90,000s =6,000,000.\n\nHmm, let's collect terms with t:\n\nt(3s -600) + (-300s\u00b2 +90,000s) =6,000,000.\n\nSo:\n\nt(3s -600) =300s\u00b2 -90,000s +6,000,000.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\nt = (300s\u00b2 -90,000s +6,000,000) / (3s -600).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator.\n\nFirst, factor numerator:\n\n300s\u00b2 -90,000s +6,000,000.\n\nFactor out 300:\n\n300(s\u00b2 - 300s + 20,000).",

Therefore, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 90,000 - 2S2.\n\nAlso, we have another identity: a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = (a + b + c)\u00b3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. So, a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = S1\u00b3 - 3S1 S2 + 3S3.\n\nSubstituting S1 = 300, this becomes 300\u00b3 - 3*300*S2 + 3S3.\n\nLet me compute 300\u00b3: 300 * 300 = 90,000; 90,000 * 300 = 27,000,000. So, a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = 27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3S3.\n\nNow, going back to the second equation: 300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000.\n\nSubstituting the expressions I found:\n300*(90,000 - 2S2) - (27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3S3) = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst term: 300*(90,000 - 2S2) = 300*90,000 - 300*2S2 = 27,000,000 - 600 S2.\n\nSecond term: -(27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3S3) = -27,000,000 + 900 S2 - 3S3.\n\nSo, adding the two parts together:\n27,000,000 - 600 S2 -27,000,000 + 900 S2 - 3S3 = 6,000,000.\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\n27,000,000 - 27,000,000 cancels out.\n\n-600 S2 + 900 S2 = 300 S2.\n\nSo, the equation becomes 300 S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n300 S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000.\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 3:\n\n100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, 100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, so now we have an equation involving S2 and S3. But we also know that S1 = 300.\n\nWhat else do we know? We might need another equation to relate S2 and S3. Well, if we could find another equation, perhaps we can solve for S2 and S3.",

Maybe I can find expressions for these in terms of the sums we already know, like a + b + c.\n\nI remember that for three variables, there are identities that relate sums of powers to each other. Let me recall them.\n\nFirstly, (a + b + c)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca). We know a + b + c is 300, so (300)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca). So, 90,000 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2(ab + bc + ca).\n\nLet me denote S1 = a + b + c = 300,\nS2 = ab + bc + ca,\nS3 = abc.\n\nI think those are the standard symmetric sums.\n\nFrom the identity above, S1\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2S2. So, 90,000 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2S2. Therefore, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 90,000 - 2S2.\n\nAlso, we have another identity: a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = (a + b + c)\u00b3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. So, a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = S1\u00b3 - 3S1 S2 + 3S3.\n\nSubstituting S1 = 300, this becomes 300\u00b3 - 3*300*S2 + 3S3.\n\nLet me compute 300\u00b3: 300 * 300 = 90,000; 90,000 * 300 = 27,000,000. So, a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = 27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3S3.\n\nNow, going back to the second equation: 300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000.\n\nSubstituting the expressions I found:\n300*(90,000 - 2S2) - (27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3S3) = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst term: 300*(90,000 - 2S2) = 300*90,000 - 300*2S2 = 27,000,000 - 600 S2.\n\nSecond term: -(27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3S3) = -27,000,000 + 900 S2 - 3S3.\n\nSo, adding the two parts together:\n27,000,000 - 600 S2 -27,000,000 + 900 S2 - 3S3 = 6,000,000.\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\n27,000,000 - 27,000,000 cancels out.\n\n-600 S2 + 900 S2 = 300 S2.\n\nSo, the equation becomes 300 S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n300 S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000.\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 3:\n\n100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, 100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, so now we have an equation involving S2 and S3. But we also know that S1 = 300.\n\nWhat else do we know? We might need another equation to relate S2 and S3. Well, if we could find another equation, perhaps we can solve for S2 and S3.",

It says I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. First, the equation a + b + c = 300 is straightforward. It's a linear equation, and we're dealing with nonnegative integers, so I know that a, b, c can be 0 or any positive integer as long as their sum is 300.\n\nThe second equation is a bit more complicated: a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000. Let me see if I can simplify this expression. Maybe factor it somehow. Looking at the terms, I notice that each term is a product of two variables, one squared.

So, a = 100 is a root.\n\nTherefore, we can factor (a - 100) from the cubic equation.\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division:\n\nDivide a\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 by (a - 100).\n\nLet me set up synthetic division:\n\n100 | 1   -300    30,000    -1,000,000\n\nBring down 1.\n\n1\n\nMultiply 1 by 100: 100. Add to next coefficient: -300 + 100 = -200.\n\nMultiply -200 by 100: -20,000. Add to 30,000: 10,000.\n\nMultiply 10,000 by 100: 1,000,000. Add to -1,000,000: 0.\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000) = 0.\n\nSo, the roots are a = 100 and roots of a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000 = 0.\n\nSolving a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000 = 0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\na = [200 \u00b1 sqrt(200\u00b2 - 4*1*10,000)] / 2\n\n= [200 \u00b1 sqrt(40,000 - 40,000)] / 2\n\n= [200 \u00b1 0]/2\n\n= 100.\n\nSo, the only real root is a = 100. So, in the case where a = b, the only solution is a = b = 100, which gives c = 300 - 2*100 = 100. So, that's the same as the symmetric case. So, no new solutions here.\n\nHmm, so maybe when two variables are equal, the only solution is the symmetric one. So perhaps the only solution is when all three are equal.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps I should check if there are solutions where all three variables are different.",

Add to -1,000,000: 0.\n\nSo the cubic factors as (a -100)(a\u00b2 -200a +10,000) = 0\n\nNow, solve a\u00b2 -200a +10,000 =0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\na = [200 \u00b1\u221a(200\u00b2 -4*1*10,000)]/2\n\n= [200 \u00b1\u221a(40,000 -40,000)]/2\n\n= [200 \u00b10]/2\n\nSo a=100 is a double root.\n\nTherefore, the cubic equation has a triple root at a=100.",

Hmm, that's a good start. Now, since we know that a + b + c = 300, we can substitute (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c). Let's rewrite the second equation using this substitution.\n\nSo, the second equation becomes:\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me write that out:\n300a\u00b2 - a\u00b3 + 300b\u00b2 - b\u00b3 + 300c\u00b2 - c\u00b3 = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, that simplifies to:\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000.\n\nOkay, so now I have an equation involving a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 and a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3. Maybe I can find expressions for these in terms of the sums we already know, like a + b + c.\n\nI remember that for three variables, there are identities that relate sums of powers to each other. Let me recall them.\n\nFirstly, (a + b + c)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca). We know a + b + c is 300, so (300)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca). So, 90,000 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2(ab + bc + ca).\n\nLet me denote S1 = a + b + c = 300,\nS2 = ab + bc + ca,\nS3 = abc.\n\nI think those are the standard symmetric sums.\n\nFrom the identity above, S1\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2S2. So, 90,000 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2S2. Therefore, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 90,000 - 2S2.\n\nAlso, we have another identity: a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = (a + b + c)\u00b3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. So, a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = S1\u00b3 - 3S1 S2 + 3S3.\n\nSubstituting S1 = 300, this becomes 300\u00b3 - 3*300*S2 + 3S3.\n\nLet me compute 300\u00b3: 300 * 300 = 90,000; 90,000 * 300 = 27,000,000. So, a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = 27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3S3.\n\nNow, going back to the second equation: 300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000.\n\nSubstituting the expressions I found:\n300*(90,000 - 2S2) - (27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3S3) = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst term: 300*(90,000 - 2S2) = 300*90,000 - 300*2S2 = 27,000,000 - 600 S2.\n\nSecond term: -(27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3S3) = -27,000,000 + 900 S2 - 3S3.\n\nSo, adding the two parts together:\n27,000,000 - 600 S2 -27,000,000 + 900 S2 - 3S3 = 6,000,000.\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\n27,000,000 - 27,000,000 cancels out.\n\n-600 S2 + 900 S2 = 300 S2.\n\nSo, the equation becomes 300 S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n300 S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000.\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 3:\n\n100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, 100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, so now we have an equation involving S2 and S3.

Let's see if that's possible.\n\nIf a = b = c, then a + b + c = 3a = 300 \u21d2 a = 100.\n\nSo, a = b = c = 100. Then, ab + bc + ca = 3*100*100 = 30,000.\n\nThen, abc = 100*100*100 = 1,000,000.\n\nPlugging into the second equation: 100*30,000 - 1,000,000 = 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 2,000,000. Which matches the given equation.\n\nSo, (a, b, c) = (100, 100, 100) is a solution. So, that's one triple where all are equal.\n\nSo, that's another solution beyond the cases where one variable is zero. So, that's one more solution.\n\nNow, what about other cases where two variables are equal, and the third is different?\n\nLet me suppose that a = b \u2260 c.

Let me see if I can find integer roots.\n\nPossible rational roots are factors of 1,000,000 over factors of 1, so possible integer roots are divisors of 1,000,000.\n\nLooking for a between 1 and 150 (since c = 300 - 2a must be positive, so 300 - 2a > 0 \u21d2 a < 150).\n\nTesting a=100: 100\u00b3 - 300*100\u00b2 + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000 = 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0. So, a=100 is a root.\n\nSo, I can factor (a - 100) from the cubic.\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division:\n\nDividing a\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 by (a - 100).\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\n100 | 1   -300    30,000    -1,000,000\n           100    -20,000     1,000,000\n        -------------------------------\n          1    -200     10,000         0\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000) = 0.\n\nNow, solving a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000 = 0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: a = [200 \u00b1 sqrt(200\u00b2 - 4*1*10,000)] / 2 = [200 \u00b1 sqrt(40,000 - 40,000)] / 2 = [200 \u00b1 0]/2 = 100.\n\nSo, the cubic equation has a triple root at a=100. So, the only solution is a=100, which leads to c=300 - 2*100=100.\n\nSo, this is the case where a = b = c = 100, which we already considered earlier.\n\nSo, in the case where two variables are equal, the only solution is when all three are equal. So, no new solutions here.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can try another approach.

Maybe a, b, c are distinct. But I'm not sure how to approach that. Let me think differently.\n\nMaybe I can use the condition a + b + c = 300 to express one variable in terms of the others.

That's a lot, but maybe we can test some likely candidates.\n\nGiven that a is part of the sum 2a + c = 300, a must be between 0 and 150.

So, a = 100 is a root.\n\nTherefore, we can factor (a - 100) from the cubic equation.\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division:\n\nDivide a\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 by (a - 100).\n\nLet me set up synthetic division:\n\n100 | 1   -300    30,000    -1,000,000\n\nBring down 1.\n\n1\n\nMultiply 1 by 100: 100.

So, in the case where a = b, the only solution is a = b = 100, which gives c = 300 - 2*100 = 100. So, that's the same as the symmetric case. So, no new solutions here.\n\nHmm, so maybe when two variables are equal, the only solution is the symmetric one.

Hmm, that's a good start. Now, since we know that a + b + c = 300, we can substitute (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c). Let's rewrite the second equation using this substitution.\n\nSo, the second equation becomes:\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me write that out:\n300a\u00b2 - a\u00b3 + 300b\u00b2 - b\u00b3 + 300c\u00b2 - c\u00b3 = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, that simplifies to:\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000.\n\nOkay, so now I have an equation involving a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 and a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3. Maybe I can find expressions for these in terms of the sums we already know, like a + b + c.\n\nI remember that for three variables, there are identities that relate sums of powers to each other. Let me recall them.\n\nFirstly, (a + b + c)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca). We know a + b + c is 300, so (300)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca). So, 90,000 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2(ab + bc + ca).\n\nLet me denote S1 = a + b + c = 300,\nS2 = ab + bc + ca,\nS3 = abc.\n\nI think those are the standard symmetric sums.\n\nFrom the identity above, S1\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2S2. So, 90,000 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2S2. Therefore, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 90,000 - 2S2.\n\nAlso, we have another identity: a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = (a + b + c)\u00b3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. So, a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = S1\u00b3 - 3S1 S2 + 3S3.\n\nSubstituting S1 = 300, this becomes 300\u00b3 - 3*300*S2 + 3S3.\n\nLet me compute 300\u00b3: 300 * 300 = 90,000; 90,000 * 300 = 27,000,000. So, a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = 27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3S3.\n\nNow, going back to the second equation: 300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000.\n\nSubstituting the expressions I found:\n300*(90,000 - 2S2) - (27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3S3) = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst term: 300*(90,000 - 2S2) = 300*90,000 - 300*2S2 = 27,000,000 - 600 S2.\n\nSecond term: -(27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3S3) = -27,000,000 + 900 S2 - 3S3.\n\nSo, adding the two parts together:\n27,000,000 - 600 S2 -27,000,000 + 900 S2 - 3S3 = 6,000,000.\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\n27,000,000 - 27,000,000 cancels out.\n\n-600 S2 + 900 S2 = 300 S2.\n\nSo, the equation becomes 300 S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n300 S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000.\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 3:\n\n100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, 100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, so now we have an equation involving S2 and S3.

First, the equation a + b + c = 300 is straightforward. It's a linear equation, and we're dealing with nonnegative integers, so I know that a, b, c can be 0 or any positive integer as long as their sum is 300.\n\nThe second equation is a bit more complicated: a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000. Let me see if I can simplify this expression. Maybe factor it somehow. Looking at the terms, I notice that each term is a product of two variables, one squared.

Let me recall them.\n\nFirstly, (a + b + c)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca). We know a + b + c is 300, so (300)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca). So, 90,000 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2(ab + bc + ca).\n\nLet me denote S1 = a + b + c = 300,\nS2 = ab + bc + ca,\nS3 = abc.\n\nI think those are the standard symmetric sums.\n\nFrom the identity above, S1\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2S2. So, 90,000 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2S2. Therefore, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 90,000 - 2S2.\n\nAlso, we have another identity: a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = (a + b + c)\u00b3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. So, a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = S1\u00b3 - 3S1 S2 + 3S3.\n\nSubstituting S1 = 300, this becomes 300\u00b3 - 3*300*S2 + 3S3.\n\nLet me compute 300\u00b3: 300 * 300 = 90,000; 90,000 * 300 = 27,000,000. So, a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = 27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3S3.\n\nNow, going back to the second equation: 300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000.\n\nSubstituting the expressions I found:\n300*(90,000 - 2S2) - (27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3S3) = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst term: 300*(90,000 - 2S2) = 300*90,000 - 300*2S2 = 27,000,000 - 600 S2.\n\nSecond term: -(27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3S3) = -27,000,000 + 900 S2 - 3S3.\n\nSo, adding the two parts together:\n27,000,000 - 600 S2 -27,000,000 + 900 S2 - 3S3 = 6,000,000.\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\n27,000,000 - 27,000,000 cancels out.\n\n-600 S2 + 900 S2 = 300 S2.\n\nSo, the equation becomes 300 S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n300 S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000.\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 3:\n\n100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, 100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, so now we have an equation involving S2 and S3.

Let me re-examine the earlier steps.\n\nWe had the equation:\n\n100P - Q = 2,000,000\n\nAnd we also have the cubic:\n\nx\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + Px - Q = 0\n\nSo, if a = b = c = 100, then S = 300, P = ab + bc + ca = 3*(100*100) = 30,000, and Q = abc = 1,000,000.\n\nSo, plug into 100P - Q = 100*30,000 - 1,000,000 = 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 2,000,000, which matches. So, that's correct.\n\nBut in the cubic, when a = b = c = 100, the cubic becomes (x - 100)^3 = 0, which is x\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + 30,000x - 1,000,000 = 0.\n\nBut in our earlier analysis, when we set up the cubic equation, we substituted Q = 100P - 2,000,000, which for a = b = c = 100, would be Q = 100*30,000 - 2,000,000 = 3,000,000 - 2,000,000 = 1,000,000, which is correct.\n\nSo, why does the cubic equation factor into (x -100)(x\u00b2 -200x +20,000) =0, but when a = b = c =100, the cubic is (x -100)^3 =0? There's some inconsistency here.\n\nAh, wait, perhaps when I set up the cubic equation with Q = 100P -2,000,000, I assumed that a, b, c are distinct, but when all three are 100, that's a triple root, which isn't captured by the factorization. So, perhaps in addition to the cases where one variable is 100 and the other two are 200 and 0, we also have the case where all three variables are 100.",

So the equation becomes:\n\n300a\u00b2 - a\u00b3 + 300b\u00b2 - b\u00b3 + 300c\u00b2 - c\u00b3 = 6,000,000.",

First, the equation a + b + c = 300 is straightforward.

Let me see if I can simplify this expression. Maybe factor it somehow. Looking at the terms, I notice that each term is a product of two variables, one squared.

Hmm, that's a good start. Now, since we know that a + b + c = 300, we can substitute (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c). Let's rewrite the second equation using this substitution.\n\nSo, the second equation becomes:\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me write that out:\n300a\u00b2 - a\u00b3 + 300b\u00b2 - b\u00b3 + 300c\u00b2 - c\u00b3 = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, that simplifies to:\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000.\n\nOkay, so now I have an equation involving a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 and a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3. Maybe I can find expressions for these in terms of the sums we already know, like a + b + c.\n\nI remember that for three variables, there are identities that relate sums of powers to each other. Let me recall them.\n\nFirstly, (a + b + c)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca). We know a + b + c is 300, so (300)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca). So, 90,000 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2(ab + bc + ca).\n\nLet me denote S1 = a + b + c = 300,\nS2 = ab + bc + ca,\nS3 = abc.\n\nI think those are the standard symmetric sums.\n\nFrom the identity above, S1\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2S2. So, 90,000 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2S2. Therefore, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 90,000 - 2S2.\n\nAlso, we have another identity: a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = (a + b + c)\u00b3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. So, a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = S1\u00b3 - 3S1 S2 + 3S3.\n\nSubstituting S1 = 300, this becomes 300\u00b3 - 3*300*S2 + 3S3.\n\nLet me compute 300\u00b3: 300 * 300 = 90,000; 90,000 * 300 = 27,000,000. So, a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = 27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3S3.\n\nNow, going back to the second equation: 300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000.\n\nSubstituting the expressions I found:\n300*(90,000 - 2S2) - (27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3S3) = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst term: 300*(90,000 - 2S2) = 300*90,000 - 300*2S2 = 27,000,000 - 600 S2.\n\nSecond term: -(27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3S3) = -27,000,000 + 900 S2 - 3S3.\n\nSo, adding the two parts together:\n27,000,000 - 600 S2 -27,000,000 + 900 S2 - 3S3 = 6,000,000.\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\n27,000,000 - 27,000,000 cancels out.\n\n-600 S2 + 900 S2 = 300 S2.\n\nSo, the equation becomes 300 S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n300 S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000.\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 3:\n\n100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, 100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, so now we have an equation involving S2 and S3.

Let's say c = 300 - a - b.\n\nThen, substitute c into the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000.\n\nSubstituting c:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2(300 - a - b) + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2(300 - a - b) + (300 - a - b)^2 a + (300 - a - b)^2 b = 6,000,000.\n\nThat's a bit messy, but maybe I can expand it and see if something simplifies.\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: a\u00b2b\n\nSecond term: a\u00b2(300 - a - b) = 300a\u00b2 - a\u00b3 - a\u00b2b\n\nThird term: b\u00b2a\n\nFourth term: b\u00b2(300 - a - b) = 300b\u00b2 - ab\u00b2 - b\u00b3\n\nFifth term: (300 - a - b)^2 a\n\nLet me expand (300 - a - b)^2:\n\n= 300\u00b2 - 2*300*(a + b) + (a + b)^2\n= 90,000 - 600(a + b) + a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2\n\nSo, fifth term: [90,000 - 600(a + b) + a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2] * a\n= 90,000a - 600a(a + b) + a\u00b3 + 2a\u00b2b + ab\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, sixth term: (300 - a - b)^2 b = [90,000 - 600(a + b) + a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2] * b\n= 90,000b - 600b(a + b) + a\u00b2b + 2ab\u00b2 + b\u00b3\n\nNow, let's collect all terms together:\n\nFirst term: a\u00b2b\n\nSecond term: 300a\u00b2 - a\u00b3 - a\u00b2b\n\nThird term: b\u00b2a\n\nFourth term: 300b\u00b2 - ab\u00b2 - b\u00b3\n\nFifth term: 90,000a - 600a(a + b) + a\u00b3 + 2a\u00b2b + ab\u00b2\n\nSixth term: 90,000b - 600b(a + b) + a\u00b2b + 2ab\u00b2 + b\u00b3\n\nNow, let's add all these terms together:\n\na\u00b2b + (300a\u00b2 - a\u00b3 - a\u00b2b) + b\u00b2a + (300b\u00b2 - ab\u00b2 - b\u00b3) + (90,000a - 600a(a + b) + a\u00b3 + 2a\u00b2b + ab\u00b2) + (90,000b - 600b(a + b) + a\u00b2b + 2ab\u00b2 + b\u00b3)\n\nLet me group like terms:\n\n- a\u00b3 terms: -a\u00b3 + a\u00b3 = 0\n- b\u00b3 terms: -b\u00b3 + b\u00b3 = 0\n- a\u00b2b terms: a\u00b2b - a\u00b2b + 2a\u00b2b + a\u00b2b = (1 -1 +2 +1) a\u00b2b = 3a\u00b2b\n- ab\u00b2 terms: ab\u00b2 - ab\u00b2 + ab\u00b2 + 2ab\u00b2 = (1 -1 +1 +2) ab\u00b2 = 3ab\u00b2\n- a\u00b2 terms: 300a\u00b2\n- b\u00b2 terms: 300b\u00b2\n- a terms: 90,000a\n- b terms: 90,000b\n- terms with a(a + b): -600a(a + b) -600b(a + b) = -600(a + b)^2\n- terms with a\u00b2b: already covered\n- terms with ab\u00b2: already covered",

Let me see if I can find integer roots.\n\nPossible rational roots are factors of 1,000,000 over factors of 1, so possible integer roots are divisors of 1,000,000.\n\nLooking for a between 1 and 150 (since c = 300 - 2a must be positive, so 300 - 2a > 0 \u21d2 a < 150).\n\nTesting a=100: 100\u00b3 - 300*100\u00b2 + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000 = 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0. So, a=100 is a root.\n\nSo, I can factor (a - 100) from the cubic.\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division:\n\nDividing a\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 by (a - 100).\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\n100 | 1   -300    30,000    -1,000,000\n           100    -20,000     1,000,000\n        -------------------------------\n          1    -200     10,000         0\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000) = 0.\n\nNow, solving a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000 = 0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: a = [200 \u00b1 sqrt(200\u00b2 - 4*1*10,000)] / 2 = [200 \u00b1 sqrt(40,000 - 40,000)] / 2 = [200 \u00b1 0]/2 = 100.\n\nSo, the cubic equation has a triple root at a=100. So, the only solution is a=100, which leads to c=300 - 2*100=100.\n\nSo, this is the case where a = b = c = 100, which we already considered earlier.\n\nSo, in the case where two variables are equal, the only solution is when all three are equal. So, no new solutions here.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can try another approach.

So, let's try a = 100 first, since that worked in the symmetric case.\n\nPlug a = 100 into the equation:\n\n100\u00b3 - 300*(100)^2 + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 - 300*10,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000\n\n= 0. So, a = 100 is a root.\n\nTherefore, we can factor (a - 100) from the cubic equation.\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division:\n\nDivide a\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 by (a - 100).\n\nLet me set up synthetic division:\n\n100 | 1   -300    30,000    -1,000,000\n\nBring down 1.\n\n1\n\nMultiply 1 by 100: 100. Add to next coefficient: -300 + 100 = -200.\n\nMultiply -200 by 100: -20,000. Add to 30,000: 10,000.\n\nMultiply 10,000 by 100: 1,000,000. Add to -1,000,000: 0.\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000) = 0.\n\nSo, the roots are a = 100 and roots of a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000 = 0.\n\nSolving a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000 = 0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\na = [200 \u00b1 sqrt(200\u00b2 - 4*1*10,000)] / 2\n\n= [200 \u00b1 sqrt(40,000 - 40,000)] / 2\n\n= [200 \u00b1 0]/2\n\n= 100.\n\nSo, the only real root is a = 100. So, in the case where a = b, the only solution is a = b = 100, which gives c = 300 - 2*100 = 100. So, that's the same as the symmetric case. So, no new solutions here.\n\nHmm, so maybe when two variables are equal, the only solution is the symmetric one. So perhaps the only solution is when all three are equal.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps I should check if there are solutions where all three variables are different.",

Let me check:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c = a\u00b2(b + c)\nSimilarly, b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c = b\u00b2(a + c)\nAnd c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = c\u00b2(a + b)\n\nSo, the entire expression is a\u00b2(b + c) + b\u00b2(a + c) + c\u00b2(a + b). Hmm, that's a good start. Now, since we know that a + b + c = 300, we can substitute (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c). Let's rewrite the second equation using this substitution.\n\nSo, the second equation becomes:\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me write that out:\n300a\u00b2 - a\u00b3 + 300b\u00b2 - b\u00b3 + 300c\u00b2 - c\u00b3 = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, that simplifies to:\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000.\n\nOkay, so now I have an equation involving a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 and a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3. Maybe I can find expressions for these in terms of the sums we already know, like a + b + c.\n\nI remember that for three variables, there are identities that relate sums of powers to each other. Let me recall them.\n\nFirstly, (a + b + c)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca). We know a + b + c is 300, so (300)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca). So, 90,000 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2(ab + bc + ca).\n\nLet me denote S1 = a + b + c = 300,\nS2 = ab + bc + ca,\nS3 = abc.\n\nI think those are the standard symmetric sums.\n\nFrom the identity above, S1\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2S2. So, 90,000 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2S2. Therefore, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 90,000 - 2S2.\n\nAlso, we have another identity: a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = (a + b + c)\u00b3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. So, a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = S1\u00b3 - 3S1 S2 + 3S3.\n\nSubstituting S1 = 300, this becomes 300\u00b3 - 3*300*S2 + 3S3.\n\nLet me compute 300\u00b3: 300 * 300 = 90,000; 90,000 * 300 = 27,000,000. So, a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = 27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3S3.\n\nNow, going back to the second equation: 300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000.\n\nSubstituting the expressions I found:\n300*(90,000 - 2S2) - (27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3S3) = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst term: 300*(90,000 - 2S2) = 300*90,000 - 300*2S2 = 27,000,000 - 600 S2.\n\nSecond term: -(27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3S3) = -27,000,000 + 900 S2 - 3S3.\n\nSo, adding the two parts together:\n27,000,000 - 600 S2 -27,000,000 + 900 S2 - 3S3 = 6,000,000.\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\n27,000,000 - 27,000,000 cancels out.\n\n-600 S2 + 900 S2 = 300 S2.\n\nSo, the equation becomes 300 S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n300 S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000.\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 3:\n\n100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, 100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, so now we have an equation involving S2 and S3. But we also know that S1 = 300.\n\nWhat else do we know? We might need another equation to relate S2 and S3. Well, if we could find another equation, perhaps we can solve for S2 and S3.",

Hmm, that's a good start. Now, since we know that a + b + c = 300, we can substitute (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c). Let's rewrite the second equation using this substitution.\n\nSo, the second equation becomes:\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me write that out:\n300a\u00b2 - a\u00b3 + 300b\u00b2 - b\u00b3 + 300c\u00b2 - c\u00b3 = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, that simplifies to:\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000.\n\nOkay, so now I have an equation involving a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 and a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3. Maybe I can find expressions for these in terms of the sums we already know, like a + b + c.\n\nI remember that for three variables, there are identities that relate sums of powers to each other. Let me recall them.\n\nFirstly, (a + b + c)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca). We know a + b + c is 300, so (300)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca). So, 90,000 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2(ab + bc + ca).\n\nLet me denote S1 = a + b + c = 300,\nS2 = ab + bc + ca,\nS3 = abc.\n\nI think those are the standard symmetric sums.\n\nFrom the identity above, S1\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2S2. So, 90,000 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2S2. Therefore, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 90,000 - 2S2.\n\nAlso, we have another identity: a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = (a + b + c)\u00b3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. So, a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = S1\u00b3 - 3S1 S2 + 3S3.\n\nSubstituting S1 = 300, this becomes 300\u00b3 - 3*300*S2 + 3S3.\n\nLet me compute 300\u00b3: 300 * 300 = 90,000; 90,000 * 300 = 27,000,000. So, a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = 27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3S3.\n\nNow, going back to the second equation: 300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000.\n\nSubstituting the expressions I found:\n300*(90,000 - 2S2) - (27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3S3) = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst term: 300*(90,000 - 2S2) = 300*90,000 - 300*2S2 = 27,000,000 - 600 S2.\n\nSecond term: -(27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3S3) = -27,000,000 + 900 S2 - 3S3.\n\nSo, adding the two parts together:\n27,000,000 - 600 S2 -27,000,000 + 900 S2 - 3S3 = 6,000,000.\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\n27,000,000 - 27,000,000 cancels out.\n\n-600 S2 + 900 S2 = 300 S2.\n\nSo, the equation becomes 300 S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n300 S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000.\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 3:\n\n100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, 100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, so now we have an equation involving S2 and S3. But we also know that S1 = 300.\n\nWhat else do we know? We might need another equation to relate S2 and S3. Well, if we could find another equation, perhaps we can solve for S2 and S3.",

Then, since a + b + c = 300, we have 2a + c = 300 \u21d2 c = 300 - 2a.\n\nNow, let's compute S2 and S3.\n\nab + bc + ca = a\u00b2 + 2ac.\n\nBut since c = 300 - 2a, then ac = a*(300 - 2a).\n\nSo, ab + bc + ca = a\u00b2 + 2a(300 - 2a) = a\u00b2 + 600a - 4a\u00b2 = -3a\u00b2 + 600a.\n\nSimilarly, abc = a\u00b2 c = a\u00b2 (300 - 2a).\n\nNow, substituting into the second equation:\n\n100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n100*(-3a\u00b2 + 600a) - a\u00b2(300 - 2a) = 2,000,000.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n100*(-3a\u00b2 + 600a) = -300a\u00b2 + 60,000a.\n\n- a\u00b2(300 - 2a) = -300a\u00b2 + 2a\u00b3.\n\nAdding them together:\n\n-300a\u00b2 + 60,000a -300a\u00b2 + 2a\u00b3 = 2a\u00b3 - 600a\u00b2 + 60,000a.\n\nSet equal to 2,000,000:\n\n2a\u00b3 - 600a\u00b2 + 60,000a = 2,000,000.\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side:\n\n2a\u00b3 - 600a\u00b2 + 60,000a - 2,000,000 = 0.\n\nDivide all terms by 2 to simplify:\n\na\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0.\n\nHmm, now I have a cubic equation in a. Let me see if I can find integer roots.\n\nPossible rational roots are factors of 1,000,000 over factors of 1, so possible integer roots are divisors of 1,000,000.\n\nLooking for a between 1 and 150 (since c = 300 - 2a must be positive, so 300 - 2a > 0 \u21d2 a < 150).\n\nTesting a=100: 100\u00b3 - 300*100\u00b2 + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000 = 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0. So, a=100 is a root.\n\nSo, I can factor (a - 100) from the cubic.\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division:\n\nDividing a\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 by (a - 100).\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\n100 | 1   -300    30,000    -1,000,000\n           100    -20,000     1,000,000\n        -------------------------------\n          1    -200     10,000         0\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000) = 0.\n\nNow, solving a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000 = 0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: a = [200 \u00b1 sqrt(200\u00b2 - 4*1*10,000)] / 2 = [200 \u00b1 sqrt(40,000 - 40,000)] / 2 = [200 \u00b1 0]/2 = 100.\n\nSo, the cubic equation has a triple root at a=100. So, the only solution is a=100, which leads to c=300 - 2*100=100.\n\nSo, this is the case where a = b = c = 100, which we already considered earlier.\n\nSo, in the case where two variables are equal, the only solution is when all three are equal. So, no new solutions here.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can try another approach. Let me think: Maybe the only solutions are the ones where one variable is zero and the other two are 200 and 100, and the case where all are 100.",

Let me recall them.\n\nFirstly, (a + b + c)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca). We know a + b + c is 300, so (300)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca). So, 90,000 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2(ab + bc + ca).\n\nLet me denote S1 = a + b + c = 300,\nS2 = ab + bc + ca,\nS3 = abc.\n\nI think those are the standard symmetric sums.\n\nFrom the identity above, S1\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2S2. So, 90,000 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2S2. Therefore, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 90,000 - 2S2.\n\nAlso, we have another identity: a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = (a + b + c)\u00b3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. So, a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = S1\u00b3 - 3S1 S2 + 3S3.\n\nSubstituting S1 = 300, this becomes 300\u00b3 - 3*300*S2 + 3S3.\n\nLet me compute 300\u00b3: 300 * 300 = 90,000; 90,000 * 300 = 27,000,000. So, a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = 27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3S3.\n\nNow, going back to the second equation: 300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000.\n\nSubstituting the expressions I found:\n300*(90,000 - 2S2) - (27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3S3) = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst term: 300*(90,000 - 2S2) = 300*90,000 - 300*2S2 = 27,000,000 - 600 S2.\n\nSecond term: -(27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3S3) = -27,000,000 + 900 S2 - 3S3.\n\nSo, adding the two parts together:\n27,000,000 - 600 S2 -27,000,000 + 900 S2 - 3S3 = 6,000,000.\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\n27,000,000 - 27,000,000 cancels out.\n\n-600 S2 + 900 S2 = 300 S2.\n\nSo, the equation becomes 300 S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n300 S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000.\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 3:\n\n100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, 100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, so now we have an equation involving S2 and S3. But we also know that S1 = 300.\n\nWhat else do we know? We might need another equation to relate S2 and S3. Well, if we could find another equation, perhaps we can solve for S2 and S3.",

It says I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. First, the equation a + b + c = 300 is straightforward. It's a linear equation, and we're dealing with nonnegative integers, so I know that a, b, c can be 0 or any positive integer as long as their sum is 300.\n\nThe second equation is a bit more complicated: a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000. Let me see if I can simplify this expression. Maybe factor it somehow. Looking at the terms, I notice that each term is a product of two variables, one squared. So, for example, a\u00b2b and a\u00b2c both have a\u00b2 multiplied by another variable.",

Let me recall them.\n\nFirstly, (a + b + c)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca). We know a + b + c is 300, so (300)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca). So, 90,000 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2(ab + bc + ca).\n\nLet me denote S1 = a + b + c = 300,\nS2 = ab + bc + ca,\nS3 = abc.\n\nI think those are the standard symmetric sums.\n\nFrom the identity above, S1\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2S2. So, 90,000 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2S2. Therefore, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 90,000 - 2S2.\n\nAlso, we have another identity: a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = (a + b + c)\u00b3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. So, a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = S1\u00b3 - 3S1 S2 + 3S3.\n\nSubstituting S1 = 300, this becomes 300\u00b3 - 3*300*S2 + 3S3.\n\nLet me compute 300\u00b3: 300 * 300 = 90,000; 90,000 * 300 = 27,000,000. So, a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = 27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3S3.\n\nNow, going back to the second equation: 300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000.\n\nSubstituting the expressions I found:\n300*(90,000 - 2S2) - (27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3S3) = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst term: 300*(90,000 - 2S2) = 300*90,000 - 300*2S2 = 27,000,000 - 600 S2.\n\nSecond term: -(27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3S3) = -27,000,000 + 900 S2 - 3S3.\n\nSo, adding the two parts together:\n27,000,000 - 600 S2 -27,000,000 + 900 S2 - 3S3 = 6,000,000.\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\n27,000,000 - 27,000,000 cancels out.\n\n-600 S2 + 900 S2 = 300 S2.\n\nSo, the equation becomes 300 S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n300 S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000.\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 3:\n\n100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, 100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, so now we have an equation involving S2 and S3.

So, a=100 is a root.\n\nSo, I can factor (a - 100) from the cubic.\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division:\n\nDividing a\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 by (a - 100).\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\n100 | 1   -300    30,000    -1,000,000\n           100    -20,000     1,000,000\n        -------------------------------\n          1    -200     10,000         0\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000) = 0.\n\nNow, solving a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000 = 0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: a = [200 \u00b1 sqrt(200\u00b2 - 4*1*10,000)] / 2 = [200 \u00b1 sqrt(40,000 - 40,000)] / 2 = [200 \u00b1 0]/2 = 100.\n\nSo, the cubic equation has a triple root at a=100. So, the only solution is a=100, which leads to c=300 - 2*100=100.\n\nSo, this is the case where a = b = c = 100, which we already considered earlier.\n\nSo, in the case where two variables are equal, the only solution is when all three are equal. So, no new solutions here.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can try another approach. Let me think: Maybe the only solutions are the ones where one variable is zero and the other two are 200 and 100, and the case where all are 100.",
