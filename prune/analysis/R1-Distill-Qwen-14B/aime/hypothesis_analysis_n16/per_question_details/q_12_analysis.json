C + F = 9\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. Each pair adds up to 9.\n\nNow, looking at the second condition: AD + BE + CF = 99.\n\nAD is a two-digit number, which is 10*A + D. Similarly, BE is 10*B + E, and CF is 10*C + F. So:\n\n(10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F) = 99.\n\nLet me rearrange this:\n\n10(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.\n\nSo, 10*(A+B+C) + (D+E+F) = 99.\n\nHmm, interesting. Let me write that as:\n\n10*(A+B+C) + (D+E+F) = 99. (Equation 4)\n\nNow, from the first set of equations, we know that A + D =9, B + E=9, C + F=9. So, adding all three, we get:\n\n(A + D) + (B + E) + (C + F) = 27.\n\nWhich simplifies to (A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 27.\n\nLet me denote S = A + B + C and T = D + E + F. So, S + T = 27.\n\nFrom Equation 4: 10*S + T = 99.\n\nSo, now I have two equations:\n\n1. S + T = 27\n2. 10*S + T = 99\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(10S + T) - (S + T) = 99 - 27\n9S = 72\nSo, S = 8.\n\nThen, substituting back into the first equation: 8 + T = 27, so T = 19.\n\nSo, S = 8 and T = 19.\n\nSo, A + B + C = 8 and D + E + F = 19.\n\nBut we also have A + D =9, B + E=9, C + F=9.\n\nSo, now, let's think about each column.\n\nFor each column, the sum of the top and bottom digits is 9. So, each column sums to 9.\n\nSo, in column 1, A + D =9.\n\nIn column 2, B + E=9.\n\nIn column 3, C + F=9.\n\nBut, the sum of the top row is A + B + C =8, and the sum of the bottom row is D + E + F=19.\n\nSo, since each column sums to 9, the total sum for the grid is 9*3=27, which matches the earlier result.\n\nNow, let's think about each column independently.\n\nFor each column, the digits add up to 9.

So:\n\n(10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F) = 99.\n\nLet me rearrange this:\n\n10(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.\n\nSo, 10*(A+B+C) + (D+E+F) = 99.\n\nHmm, interesting. Let me write that as:\n\n10*(A+B+C) + (D+E+F) = 99. (Equation 4)\n\nNow, from the first set of equations, we know that A + D =9, B + E=9, C + F=9. So, adding all three, we get:\n\n(A + D) + (B + E) + (C + F) = 27.\n\nWhich simplifies to (A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 27.\n\nLet me denote S = A + B + C and T = D + E + F. So, S + T = 27.\n\nFrom Equation 4: 10*S + T = 99.\n\nSo, now I have two equations:\n\n1. S + T = 27\n2. 10*S + T = 99\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(10S + T) - (S + T) = 99 - 27\n9S = 72\nSo, S = 8.\n\nThen, substituting back into the first equation: 8 + T = 27, so T = 19.\n\nSo, S = 8 and T = 19.\n\nSo, A + B + C = 8 and D + E + F = 19.\n\nBut we also have A + D =9, B + E=9, C + F=9.\n\nSo, now, let's think about each column.\n\nFor each column, the sum of the top and bottom digits is 9. So, each column sums to 9.\n\nSo, in column 1, A + D =9.\n\nIn column 2, B + E=9.\n\nIn column 3, C + F=9.\n\nBut, the sum of the top row is A + B + C =8, and the sum of the bottom row is D + E + F=19.\n\nSo, since each column sums to 9, the total sum for the grid is 9*3=27, which matches the earlier result.\n\nNow, let's think about each column independently.\n\nFor each column, the digits add up to 9. So, for column 1, A can be from 0 to 9, but D has to be 9 - A. But D is a digit in the bottom row, so it can be 0 to 9 as well.",

Since 8 is less than 3*9=27, and all digits are non-negative integers, the constraints are a, b, c >=0 and <=9.\n\nBut since a, b, c are digits, their maximum is 9, but since a + b + c=8, each of a, b, c can be at most 8, so they are automatically within 0-9.\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions is the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8, which is C(8 +3 -1, 3 -1) = C(10,2)=45.",

Let me write that as:\n\n10*(A+B+C) + (D+E+F) = 99. (Equation 4)\n\nNow, from the first set of equations, we know that A + D =9, B + E=9, C + F=9. So, adding all three, we get:\n\n(A + D) + (B + E) + (C + F) = 27.\n\nWhich simplifies to (A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 27.\n\nLet me denote S = A + B + C and T = D + E + F. So, S + T = 27.\n\nFrom Equation 4: 10*S + T = 99.\n\nSo, now I have two equations:\n\n1. S + T = 27\n2. 10*S + T = 99\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(10S + T) - (S + T) = 99 - 27\n9S = 72\nSo, S = 8.\n\nThen, substituting back into the first equation: 8 + T = 27, so T = 19.\n\nSo, S = 8 and T = 19.\n\nSo, A + B + C = 8 and D + E + F = 19.\n\nBut we also have A + D =9, B + E=9, C + F=9.\n\nSo, now, let's think about each column.\n\nFor each column, the sum of the top and bottom digits is 9. So, each column sums to 9.\n\nSo, in column 1, A + D =9.\n\nIn column 2, B + E=9.\n\nIn column 3, C + F=9.\n\nBut, the sum of the top row is A + B + C =8, and the sum of the bottom row is D + E + F=19.\n\nSo, since each column sums to 9, the total sum for the grid is 9*3=27, which matches the earlier result.\n\nNow, let's think about each column independently.\n\nFor each column, the digits add up to 9. So, for column 1, A can be from 0 to 9, but D has to be 9 - A. But D is a digit in the bottom row, so it can be 0 to 9 as well.",

So, 10a -c +11d + e = 100.\n\nWe need to find all possible a, c, d, e in 0-9 such that this is true.\n\nOk, perhaps we can express equation 3 as:\n\n10a +11d + e = c + 100.\n\nBut since c is a digit (0-9), c + 100 is between 100 and 109.\n\nSo, 10a +11d + e must be between 100 and 109.\n\nSo, 100 \u2264 10a +11d + e \u2264 109.\n\nHmm, so we can think of 10a +11d + e as some number between 100 and 109.\n\nSo let me denote S = 10a +11d + e. Then S is between 100 and 109.\n\nSo, let's think about possible a, d, e such that 10a +11d + e is between 100 and 109.\n\nSince a and d are digits (0-9), let's see the possible values:\n\n10a can be up to 90, 11d can be up to 99. So 10a +11d can be up to 189, but with e, up to 198. But since S is between 100-109, let's find possible a and d.\n\nLet me consider a from 0 to 9, d from 0 to9.\n\nCompute 10a +11d. Let's see what values can reach S=100 to 109.\n\nSo, 10a +11d must be between 100 - e and 109 - e. Since e is 0-9, 10a +11d must be between 91 and 109.",

So:\n\n(10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F) = 99.\n\nLet me rearrange this:\n\n10(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.\n\nSo, 10*(A+B+C) + (D+E+F) = 99.\n\nHmm, interesting. Let me write that as:\n\n10*(A+B+C) + (D+E+F) = 99. (Equation 4)\n\nNow, from the first set of equations, we know that A + D =9, B + E=9, C + F=9. So, adding all three, we get:\n\n(A + D) + (B + E) + (C + F) = 27.\n\nWhich simplifies to (A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 27.\n\nLet me denote S = A + B + C and T = D + E + F. So, S + T = 27.\n\nFrom Equation 4: 10*S + T = 99.\n\nSo, now I have two equations:\n\n1. S + T = 27\n2. 10*S + T = 99\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(10S + T) - (S + T) = 99 - 27\n9S = 72\nSo, S = 8.\n\nThen, substituting back into the first equation: 8 + T = 27, so T = 19.\n\nSo, S = 8 and T = 19.\n\nSo, A + B + C = 8 and D + E + F = 19.\n\nBut we also have A + D =9, B + E=9, C + F=9.\n\nSo, now, let's think about each column.\n\nFor each column, the sum of the top and bottom digits is 9. So, each column sums to 9.\n\nSo, in column 1, A + D =9.\n\nIn column 2, B + E=9.\n\nIn column 3, C + F=9.\n\nBut, the sum of the top row is A + B + C =8, and the sum of the bottom row is D + E + F=19.\n\nSo, since each column sums to 9, the total sum for the grid is 9*3=27, which matches the earlier result.\n\nNow, let's think about each column independently.\n\nFor each column, the digits add up to 9. So, for column 1, A can be from 0 to 9, but D has to be 9 - A. But D is a digit in the bottom row, so it can be 0 to 9 as well.",
