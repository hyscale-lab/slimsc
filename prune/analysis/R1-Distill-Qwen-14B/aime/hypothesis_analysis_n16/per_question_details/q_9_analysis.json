But since k is log_x(y), that means y = x^{10/x}.\n\nOkay, so from the first equation, I get that y is equal to x raised to the power of 10/x. Let me write that down: y = x^{10/x}.\n\nNow, let's look at the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) =10.\n\nAgain, using the logarithm power rule, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10.\n\nHmm, log_y(x) is the reciprocal of log_x(y), right? Because log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, log_y(x) = 1 / log_x(y).\n\nFrom the first equation, we found that log_x(y) = 10 / x. So, log_y(x) = x / 10.\n\nSo, substituting back into the second equation, we have 4y * (x / 10) = 10.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n4y * (x / 10) = 10.\n\nSimplify that: (4xy) / 10 = 10.\n\nMultiply both sides by 10: 4xy = 100.\n\nDivide both sides by 4: xy = 25.",
