So, if \ud835\udc9c\u212c is the set of all boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23, then the sphere needs to contain every such box. So, the sphere must be large enough to contain the \"biggest\" box in terms of space diagonal. So, the radius r is the maximum space diagonal of any box in \ud835\udc9c\u212c divided by 2. Therefore, r\u00b2 would be (max space diagonal)\u00b2 / 4.\n\nSo, the key steps are: \n\n1. Express the space diagonal of a rectangular box in terms of its dimensions.\n2. Find the maximum possible space diagonal among all boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23.\n3. Square that maximum diagonal, divide by 4, and express as a reduced fraction.\n4. Sum the numerator and denominator.\n\nAlright, let's break it down.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the dimensions of the box as x, y, z. \n\nWe know that the surface area S of a rectangular box is given by:\nS = 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54.\n\nAnd the volume V is:\nV = xyz = 23.\n\nWe're looking to maximize the space diagonal D, which is:\nD = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2).\n\nSo, we need to maximize sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) given the constraints 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.",

The problem says \"the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B.\" So, for each box in B, the sphere must contain it, so the sphere must be large enough to contain any box from B. Therefore, the radius would be the supremum (maximum) of half the space diagonals of all boxes in B.\n\nSo, the key is to find the maximum possible space diagonal among all boxes in B, then divide by 2 to get the radius, then square it.\n\nSo, first step: Let me denote the sides of the rectangular box as x, y, z. Then, the surface area is 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54, and volume is xyz = 23.\n\nWe need to find the maximum of sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) among all x, y, z positive real numbers satisfying those two conditions.\n\nSo, our problem reduces to maximizing sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2), which is equivalent to maximizing x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2.\n\nSo, how do I maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 given that 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can use Lagrange multipliers here because it's a constrained optimization problem.\n\nLet me set up the functions.

Possible roots are factors of 46 over 1, so \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b123, \u00b146.\n\nTesting x=1: 1 -27 +46=20\u22600\n\nx=2: 8 -54 +46=0 \u2192 8-54= -46; -46 +46=0. So x=2 is a root.\n\nThus, I can factor the cubic as (x - 2)(x\u00b2 + 2x -23) = 0\n\nSo, the roots are x=2, and the roots of x\u00b2 + 2x -23=0.\n\nSolving x\u00b2 + 2x -23=0:\n\nx = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 \u00b1 2*sqrt(6)\n\nWhich are approximately -1 + 4.898 \u2248 3.898 and -1 -4.898 \u2248 -5.898.

Since we have two constraints, perhaps I can set up the Lagrangian function with two multipliers.\n\nLet me denote:\nL = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 - \u03bb(xy + yz + zx - 27) - \u03bc(xyz - 23)\n\nThen, take partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, set them to zero.\n\n\u2202L/\u2202x = 2x - \u03bb(y + z) - \u03bc(yz) = 0\n\u2202L/\u2202y = 2y - \u03bb(x + z) - \u03bc(xz) = 0\n\u2202L/\u2202z = 2z - \u03bb(x + y) - \u03bc(xy) = 0\n\nAnd the constraints:\nxy + yz + zx = 27\nxyz = 23\n\nSo, we have a system of equations:\n\n1. 2x = \u03bb(y + z) + \u03bc(yz)\n2. 2y = \u03bb(x + z) + \u03bc(xz)\n3. 2z = \u03bb(x + y) + \u03bc(xy)\n4. xy + yz + zx = 27\n5. xyz = 23\n\nHmm, this looks complicated. Maybe I can subtract equations to find relations between variables.\n\nSubtract equation 1 and 2:\n\n2x - 2y = \u03bb(y + z - x - z) + \u03bc(yz - xz)\n\u2192 2(x - y) = \u03bb(y - x) + \u03bc z(y - x)\n\u2192 2(x - y) = (\u03bb + \u03bc z)(y - x)\nFactor out (x - y):\n\u2192 2(x - y) = -(\u03bb + \u03bc z)(x - y)\n\nIf x \u2260 y, we can divide both sides by (x - y):\n\n2 = -(\u03bb + \u03bc z)\n\u2192 \u03bb + \u03bc z = -2\n\nSimilarly, subtract equation 2 and 3:\n\n2y - 2z = \u03bb(x + z - x - y) + \u03bc(xz - xy)\n\u2192 2(y - z) = \u03bb(z - y) + \u03bc x(z - y)\n\u2192 2(y - z) = -(\u03bb + \u03bc x)(y - z)\n\nAgain, if y \u2260 z, then dividing both sides by (y - z):\n\n2 = -(\u03bb + \u03bc x)\n\u2192 \u03bb + \u03bc x = -2\n\nSo, from the first subtraction, we have \u03bb + \u03bc z = -2, and from the second, \u03bb + \u03bc x = -2.\n\nTherefore, \u03bb + \u03bc z = \u03bb + \u03bc x \u2192 \u03bc z = \u03bc x \u2192 \u03bc(z - x) = 0\n\nSo, either \u03bc = 0 or z = x.\n\nCase 1: \u03bc = 0\n\nIf \u03bc = 0, then from \u03bb + \u03bc z = -2 \u2192 \u03bb = -2.\n\nNow, substitute back into equation 1:\n\n2x = \u03bb(y + z) + \u03bc(yz)\n\u2192 2x = (-2)(y + z) + 0\n\u2192 2x = -2y - 2z\n\u2192 x = -y - z\n\nBut since x, y, z are dimensions of a box, they must be positive. So, x = -(y + z) would make x negative, which is impossible. So, this case is invalid.\n\nCase 2: z = x\n\nSo, z = x.\n\nNow, let's see. Since z = x, let's substitute z = x into our equations.\n\nFrom equation 1: 2x = \u03bb(y + x) + \u03bc(y x)\n\u2192 2x = \u03bb y + \u03bb x + \u03bc x y\n\u2192 2x - \u03bb x - \u03bc x y = \u03bb y\n\u2192 x(2 - \u03bb - \u03bc y) = \u03bb y\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2: 2y = \u03bb(x + z) + \u03bc(x z)\nBut z = x, so:\n2y = \u03bb(2x) + \u03bc(x\u00b2)\n\u2192 2y = 2\u03bb x + \u03bc x\u00b2\n\nFrom equation 3: 2z = \u03bb(x + y) + \u03bc(x y)\nBut z = x, so:\n2x = \u03bb(x + y) + \u03bc x y",
          "text2": "Wait, that can't be right because for each box, the sphere must contain it. So, the sphere must be large enough to contain any box from \ud835\udc9c.

Or perhaps, since the problem is symmetric in x, y, z, maybe the maximum occurs when two variables are equal? Maybe we can assume that two variables are equal and see.\n\nLet me consider whether the maximum occurs when two variables are equal.\n\nLet me suppose that x = y. Then, we can express everything in terms of x and z.\n\nSo, if x = y, then:\n\nConstraint 1: x\u00b2 + 2xz = 27.\n\nConstraint 2: x\u00b2 z = 23.\n\nWe can solve for z from constraint 2: z = 23 / x\u00b2.\n\nSubstitute into constraint 1:\n\nx\u00b2 + 2x*(23 / x\u00b2) = 27.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b2 + (46 / x) = 27.\n\nMultiply both sides by x:\n\nx\u00b3 + 46 = 27x.\n\nSo, x\u00b3 -27x +46 =0.\n\nWe need to solve this cubic equation for x.\n\nLet me try to find rational roots using Rational Root Theorem.

Maybe I can subtract equations to find relations between variables.\n\nSubtract equation 1 and 2:\n\n2x - 2y = \u03bb(y + z - x - z) + \u03bc(yz - xz)\n\u2192 2(x - y) = \u03bb(y - x) + \u03bc z(y - x)\n\u2192 2(x - y) = (\u03bb + \u03bc z)(y - x)\nFactor out (x - y):\n\u2192 2(x - y) = -(\u03bb + \u03bc z)(x - y)\n\nIf x \u2260 y, we can divide both sides by (x - y):\n\n2 = -(\u03bb + \u03bc z)\n\u2192 \u03bb + \u03bc z = -2\n\nSimilarly, subtract equation 2 and 3:\n\n2y - 2z = \u03bb(x + z - x - y) + \u03bc(xz - xy)\n\u2192 2(y - z) = \u03bb(z - y) + \u03bc x(z - y)\n\u2192 2(y - z) = -(\u03bb + \u03bc x)(y - z)\n\nAgain, if y \u2260 z, then dividing both sides by (y - z):\n\n2 = -(\u03bb + \u03bc x)\n\u2192 \u03bb + \u03bc x = -2\n\nSo, from the first subtraction, we have \u03bb + \u03bc z = -2, and from the second, \u03bb + \u03bc x = -2.\n\nTherefore, \u03bb + \u03bc z = \u03bb + \u03bc x \u2192 \u03bc z = \u03bc x \u2192 \u03bc(z - x) = 0\n\nSo, either \u03bc = 0 or z = x.\n\nCase 1: \u03bc = 0\n\nIf \u03bc = 0, then from \u03bb + \u03bc z = -2 \u2192 \u03bb = -2.\n\nNow, substitute back into equation 1:\n\n2x = \u03bb(y + z) + \u03bc(yz)\n\u2192 2x = (-2)(y + z) + 0\n\u2192 2x = -2y - 2z\n\u2192 x = -y - z\n\nBut since x, y, z are dimensions of a box, they must be positive. So, x = -(y + z) would make x negative, which is impossible. So, this case is invalid.\n\nCase 2: z = x\n\nSo, z = x.\n\nNow, let's see. Since z = x, let's substitute z = x into our equations.\n\nFrom equation 1: 2x = \u03bb(y + x) + \u03bc(y x)\n\u2192 2x = \u03bb y + \u03bb x + \u03bc x y\n\u2192 2x - \u03bb x - \u03bc x y = \u03bb y\n\u2192 x(2 - \u03bb - \u03bc y) = \u03bb y\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2: 2y = \u03bb(x + z) + \u03bc(x z)\nBut z = x, so:\n2y = \u03bb(2x) + \u03bc(x\u00b2)\n\u2192 2y = 2\u03bb x + \u03bc x\u00b2\n\nFrom equation 3: 2z = \u03bb(x + y) + \u03bc(x y)\nBut z = x, so:\n2x = \u03bb(x + y) + \u03bc x y",
          "text2": "Wait, that can't be right because for each box, the sphere must contain it. So, the sphere must be large enough to contain any box from \ud835\udc9c. So, the minimal such sphere would have a radius equal to the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in \ud835\udc9c divided by 2.\n\nSo, to find the minimal r, we have to find the maximum value of sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)/2, given the constraints on surface area and volume.\n\nTherefore, we need to maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2, given that 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 (surface area) and xyz = 23 (volume).\n\nSo, the problem reduces to maximizing x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 with the constraints 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.\n\nLet me write down the given:\n\nConstraint 1: 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 \u21d2 xy + yz + xz = 27.\n\nConstraint 2: xyz = 23.\n\nWe need to maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2.\n\nSo, I need to find the maximum of x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 given that xy + yz + xz = 27 and xyz = 23.\n\nHmm, how to approach this.\n\nI remember that for optimization problems with symmetric constraints, sometimes using Lagrange multipliers is a way to go. Or perhaps, since the problem is symmetric in x, y, z, maybe the maximum occurs when two variables are equal? Maybe we can assume that two variables are equal and see.\n\nLet me consider whether the maximum occurs when two variables are equal.\n\nLet me suppose that x = y. Then, we can express everything in terms of x and z.\n\nSo, if x = y, then:\n\nConstraint 1: x\u00b2 + 2xz = 27.\n\nConstraint 2: x\u00b2 z = 23.\n\nWe can solve for z from constraint 2: z = 23 / x\u00b2.\n\nSubstitute into constraint 1:\n\nx\u00b2 + 2x*(23 / x\u00b2) = 27.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b2 + (46 / x) = 27.\n\nMultiply both sides by x:\n\nx\u00b3 + 46 = 27x.\n\nSo, x\u00b3 -27x +46 =0.\n\nWe need to solve this cubic equation for x.\n\nLet me try to find rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b123, \u00b146.\n\nTesting x=1: 1 -27 +46=20 \u22600.\n\nx=2: 8 -54 +46=0.

The gradients of f should be a linear combination of the gradients of g and h.\n\nSo, the gradients:\n\n\u2207f = (2x, 2y, 2z)\n\n\u2207g = (2(y + z), 2(x + z), 2(x + y))\n\n\u2207h = (yz, xz, xy)\n\nThen, the condition is \u2207f = \u03bb\u2207g + \u03bc\u2207h\n\nSo, we have the system:\n\n2x = \u03bb*2(y + z) + \u03bc*(yz)  --- (1)\n\n2y = \u03bb*2(x + z) + \u03bc*(xz)  --- (2)\n\n2z = \u03bb*2(x + y) + \u03bc*(xy)  --- (3)\n\nAnd the constraints:\n\nxy + yz + xz = 27 --- (4)\n\nxyz = 23 --- (5)\n\nHmm, okay. So, that's a system of five equations with five variables: x, y, z, \u03bb, \u03bc.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe we can find a symmetric solution or find ratios between x, y, z.\n\nAssume that x, y, z are all different.",

Then, the surface area is 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54, and volume is xyz = 23.\n\nWe need to find the maximum of sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) among all x, y, z positive real numbers satisfying those two conditions.\n\nSo, our problem reduces to maximizing sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2), which is equivalent to maximizing x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2.\n\nSo, how do I maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 given that 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can use Lagrange multipliers here because it's a constrained optimization problem.\n\nLet me set up the functions. Let me denote f(x, y, z) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2, which I want to maximize.\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n1. g(x, y, z) = 2(xy + yz + xz) - 54 = 0\n2. h(x, y, z) = xyz - 23 = 0\n\nSo, we have two constraints, so we'll need to set up the Lagrangian with two multipliers.\n\nThe Lagrangian would be L = f - \u03bbg - \u03bch = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 - \u03bb(2(xy + yz + xz) - 54) - \u03bc(xyz - 23)\n\nThen, taking partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, and setting them to zero.\n\nPartial derivative with respect to x:\n\ndL/dx = 2x - \u03bb(2y + 2z) - \u03bc(yz) = 0\n\nSimilarly, partial derivatives with respect to y and z:\n\ndL/dy = 2y - \u03bb(2x + 2z) - \u03bc(xz) = 0\n\ndL/dz = 2z - \u03bb(2x + 2y) - \u03bc(xy) = 0\n\nSo, now we have three equations:\n\n1. 2x - 2\u03bb(y + z) - \u03bc yz = 0\n\n2. 2y - 2\u03bb(x + z) - \u03bc xz = 0\n\n3. 2z - 2\u03bb(x + y) - \u03bc xy = 0\n\nHmm, that's a system of nonlinear equations. Let me see if I can find a relationship between x, y, z.\n\nMaybe assume that x = y = z?",

Maybe I can subtract equations to find relations between variables.\n\nSubtract equation 1 and 2:\n\n2x - 2y = \u03bb(y + z - x - z) + \u03bc(yz - xz)\n\u2192 2(x - y) = \u03bb(y - x) + \u03bc z(y - x)\n\u2192 2(x - y) = (\u03bb + \u03bc z)(y - x)\nFactor out (x - y):\n\u2192 2(x - y) = -(\u03bb + \u03bc z)(x - y)\n\nIf x \u2260 y, we can divide both sides by (x - y):\n\n2 = -(\u03bb + \u03bc z)\n\u2192 \u03bb + \u03bc z = -2\n\nSimilarly, subtract equation 2 and 3:\n\n2y - 2z = \u03bb(x + z - x - y) + \u03bc(xz - xy)\n\u2192 2(y - z) = \u03bb(z - y) + \u03bc x(z - y)\n\u2192 2(y - z) = -(\u03bb + \u03bc x)(y - z)\n\nAgain, if y \u2260 z, then dividing both sides by (y - z):\n\n2 = -(\u03bb + \u03bc x)\n\u2192 \u03bb + \u03bc x = -2\n\nSo, from the first subtraction, we have \u03bb + \u03bc z = -2, and from the second, \u03bb + \u03bc x = -2.\n\nTherefore, \u03bb + \u03bc z = \u03bb + \u03bc x \u2192 \u03bc z = \u03bc x \u2192 \u03bc(z - x) = 0\n\nSo, either \u03bc = 0 or z = x.\n\nCase 1: \u03bc = 0\n\nIf \u03bc = 0, then from \u03bb + \u03bc z = -2 \u2192 \u03bb = -2.\n\nNow, substitute back into equation 1:\n\n2x = \u03bb(y + z) + \u03bc(yz)\n\u2192 2x = (-2)(y + z) + 0\n\u2192 2x = -2y - 2z\n\u2192 x = -y - z\n\nBut since x, y, z are dimensions of a box, they must be positive. So, x = -(y + z) would make x negative, which is impossible. So, this case is invalid.\n\nCase 2: z = x\n\nSo, z = x.\n\nNow, let's see. Since z = x, let's substitute z = x into our equations.\n\nFrom equation 1: 2x = \u03bb(y + x) + \u03bc(y x)\n\u2192 2x = \u03bb y + \u03bb x + \u03bc x y\n\u2192 2x - \u03bb x - \u03bc x y = \u03bb y\n\u2192 x(2 - \u03bb - \u03bc y) = \u03bb y\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2: 2y = \u03bb(x + z) + \u03bc(x z)\nBut z = x, so:\n2y = \u03bb(2x) + \u03bc(x\u00b2)\n\u2192 2y = 2\u03bb x + \u03bc x\u00b2\n\nFrom equation 3: 2z = \u03bb(x + y) + \u03bc(x y)\nBut z = x, so:\n2x = \u03bb(x + y) + \u03bc x y",
          "text2": "Wait, that can't be right because for each box, the sphere must contain it. So, the sphere must be large enough to contain any box from \ud835\udc9c. So, the minimal such sphere would have a radius equal to the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in \ud835\udc9c divided by 2.\n\nSo, to find the minimal r, we have to find the maximum value of sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)/2, given the constraints on surface area and volume.\n\nTherefore, we need to maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2, given that 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 (surface area) and xyz = 23 (volume).\n\nSo, the problem reduces to maximizing x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 with the constraints 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.\n\nLet me write down the given:\n\nConstraint 1: 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 \u21d2 xy + yz + xz = 27.\n\nConstraint 2: xyz = 23.\n\nWe need to maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2.\n\nSo, I need to find the maximum of x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 given that xy + yz + xz = 27 and xyz = 23.\n\nHmm, how to approach this.\n\nI remember that for optimization problems with symmetric constraints, sometimes using Lagrange multipliers is a way to go. Or perhaps, since the problem is symmetric in x, y, z, maybe the maximum occurs when two variables are equal? Maybe we can assume that two variables are equal and see.\n\nLet me consider whether the maximum occurs when two variables are equal.\n\nLet me suppose that x = y. Then, we can express everything in terms of x and z.\n\nSo, if x = y, then:\n\nConstraint 1: x\u00b2 + 2xz = 27.\n\nConstraint 2: x\u00b2 z = 23.\n\nWe can solve for z from constraint 2: z = 23 / x\u00b2.\n\nSubstitute into constraint 1:\n\nx\u00b2 + 2x*(23 / x\u00b2) = 27.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b2 + (46 / x) = 27.\n\nMultiply both sides by x:\n\nx\u00b3 + 46 = 27x.\n\nSo, x\u00b3 -27x +46 =0.\n\nWe need to solve this cubic equation for x.\n\nLet me try to find rational roots using Rational Root Theorem.

Let's perform polynomial division or factorization.\n\nDivide b\u00b3 -27b +46 by (b -2).\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\n2 | 1  0  -27  46\n\nMultiply 2*1=2, add to next coefficient: 0+2=2\n\nMultiply 2*2=4, add to -27: -23\n\nMultiply 2*(-23)= -46, add to 46: 0. Perfect.\n\nSo, the cubic factors into (b -2)(b\u00b2 + 2b -23).\n\nSo, other roots are solutions to b\u00b2 +2b -23=0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: b = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 \u00b1 2 sqrt(6).\n\nSince b must be positive, the other roots are positive: -1 + 2 sqrt(6), approximately  -1 + 4.898 \u2248 3.898.\n\nSo, possible real positive roots: b=2, and b=-1 + 2 sqrt(6).\n\nSo, when b=2, then from a = 23/(b\u00b2) = 23/4 =5.75.\n\nSo, a=5.75, b=2, c=2.\n\nCheck the surface area: 2(ab + bc + ac) = 2*(5.75*2 + 2*2 +5.75*2 )= 2*(11.5 +4 +11.5)=2*(27)=54. That's correct.\n\nVolume: a b c=5.75 * 2 *2=23. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the other positive root, b= -1 + 2 sqrt(6) \u22483.898.\n\nThen a=23/(b\u00b2). Let's compute b\u00b2:\n\nb= -1 + 2 sqrt(6). So, b\u00b2= (-1)^2 + (2 sqrt(6))\u00b2 + 2*(-1)*(2 sqrt(6))=1 +24 -4 sqrt(6)=25 -4 sqrt(6).\n\nThen a=23/(25 -4 sqrt(6)).\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4 sqrt(6)):\n\na=23*(25 +4 sqrt(6))/[(25)^2 - (4 sqrt(6))^2] =23*(25 +4 sqrt(6))/(625 - 16*6)=23*(25 +4 sqrt(6))/(625 -96)=23*(25 +4 sqrt(6))/529.\n\nSimplify 529 is 23\u00b2, so 23 cancels:\n\na=(25 +4 sqrt(6))/23.\n\nSo, a=(25 +4 sqrt(6))/23, b=c= -1 + 2 sqrt(6).\n\nSo, now, for each case, when a=5.75, b=c=2, and when a=(25 +4 sqrt(6))/23, b=c= -1 + 2 sqrt(6).\n\nNow, for each of these, we can compute a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2.\n\nFirst case: a=5.75, b=c=2.\n\nCompute a\u00b2 + 2b\u00b2 = (5.75)^2 + 2*(2)^2.\n\n5.75 is 23/4, so (23/4)^2=529/16.\n\n2*(4)=8.\n\nSo, total a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2=529/16 +8=529/16 +128/16=657/16.\n\nSo, r\u00b2= (657/16)/4=657/(64).",

So x=2 is a root.\n\nThus, I can factor the cubic as (x - 2)(x\u00b2 + 2x -23) = 0\n\nSo, the roots are x=2, and the roots of x\u00b2 + 2x -23=0.\n\nSolving x\u00b2 + 2x -23=0:\n\nx = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 \u00b1 2*sqrt(6)\n\nWhich are approximately -1 + 4.898 \u2248 3.898 and -1 -4.898 \u2248 -5.898. Since lengths can't be negative, we discard the negative root. So, x=2, or x\u22483.898.\n\nSo, possible a=2 or a\u22483.898. Let me check which one is valid.\n\nIf a=2, then c=23/(2\u00b2)=23/4=5.75.\n\nSo, a=2, b=2, c=5.75.",

Possible rational roots are factors of 46 divided by factors of 1, so \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b123, \u00b146.\n\nLet me test y=2:\n\n2\u00b3 -27*2 +46 = 8 -54 +46 = 0. Oh, y=2 is a root.\n\nSo, I can factor (y - 2) out of the cubic equation.\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division.\n\nDivide y\u00b3 -27y +46 by y -2.\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\n2 | 1  0  -27  46\n        2   4  -46\n      1  2  -23   0\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (y - 2)(y\u00b2 + 2y -23).\n\nNow, set equal to zero:\n\n(y -2)(y\u00b2 +2y -23)=0\n\nSo, the roots are y=2, and y = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 \u00b1 2*sqrt(6).\n\nSince y is positive (as it's a dimension of a box), we take y = -1 + 2 sqrt(6).",

Then, the surface area is 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54, and volume is xyz = 23.\n\nWe need to find the maximum of sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) among all x, y, z positive real numbers satisfying those two conditions.\n\nSo, our problem reduces to maximizing sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2), which is equivalent to maximizing x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2.\n\nSo, how do I maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 given that 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can use Lagrange multipliers here because it's a constrained optimization problem.\n\nLet me set up the functions.

Maybe I can subtract equations to find relations between variables.\n\nSubtract equation 1 and 2:\n\n2x - 2y = \u03bb(y + z - x - z) + \u03bc(yz - xz)\n\u2192 2(x - y) = \u03bb(y - x) + \u03bc z(y - x)\n\u2192 2(x - y) = (\u03bb + \u03bc z)(y - x)\nFactor out (x - y):\n\u2192 2(x - y) = -(\u03bb + \u03bc z)(x - y)\n\nIf x \u2260 y, we can divide both sides by (x - y):\n\n2 = -(\u03bb + \u03bc z)\n\u2192 \u03bb + \u03bc z = -2\n\nSimilarly, subtract equation 2 and 3:\n\n2y - 2z = \u03bb(x + z - x - y) + \u03bc(xz - xy)\n\u2192 2(y - z) = \u03bb(z - y) + \u03bc x(z - y)\n\u2192 2(y - z) = -(\u03bb + \u03bc x)(y - z)\n\nAgain, if y \u2260 z, then dividing both sides by (y - z):\n\n2 = -(\u03bb + \u03bc x)\n\u2192 \u03bb + \u03bc x = -2\n\nSo, from the first subtraction, we have \u03bb + \u03bc z = -2, and from the second, \u03bb + \u03bc x = -2.\n\nTherefore, \u03bb + \u03bc z = \u03bb + \u03bc x \u2192 \u03bc z = \u03bc x \u2192 \u03bc(z - x) = 0\n\nSo, either \u03bc = 0 or z = x.\n\nCase 1: \u03bc = 0\n\nIf \u03bc = 0, then from \u03bb + \u03bc z = -2 \u2192 \u03bb = -2.\n\nNow, substitute back into equation 1:\n\n2x = \u03bb(y + z) + \u03bc(yz)\n\u2192 2x = (-2)(y + z) + 0\n\u2192 2x = -2y - 2z\n\u2192 x = -y - z\n\nBut since x, y, z are dimensions of a box, they must be positive. So, x = -(y + z) would make x negative, which is impossible. So, this case is invalid.\n\nCase 2: z = x\n\nSo, z = x.\n\nNow, let's see. Since z = x, let's substitute z = x into our equations.\n\nFrom equation 1: 2x = \u03bb(y + x) + \u03bc(y x)\n\u2192 2x = \u03bb y + \u03bb x + \u03bc x y\n\u2192 2x - \u03bb x - \u03bc x y = \u03bb y\n\u2192 x(2 - \u03bb - \u03bc y) = \u03bb y\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2: 2y = \u03bb(x + z) + \u03bc(x z)\nBut z = x, so:\n2y = \u03bb(2x) + \u03bc(x\u00b2)\n\u2192 2y = 2\u03bb x + \u03bc x\u00b2\n\nFrom equation 3: 2z = \u03bb(x + y) + \u03bc(x y)\nBut z = x, so:\n2x = \u03bb(x + y) + \u03bc x y",
          "text2": "Wait, that can't be right because for each box, the sphere must contain it. So, the sphere must be large enough to contain any box from \ud835\udc9c. So, the minimal such sphere would have a radius equal to the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in \ud835\udc9c divided by 2.\n\nSo, to find the minimal r, we have to find the maximum value of sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)/2, given the constraints on surface area and volume.\n\nTherefore, we need to maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2, given that 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 (surface area) and xyz = 23 (volume).\n\nSo, the problem reduces to maximizing x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 with the constraints 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.\n\nLet me write down the given:\n\nConstraint 1: 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 \u21d2 xy + yz + xz = 27.\n\nConstraint 2: xyz = 23.\n\nWe need to maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2.\n\nSo, I need to find the maximum of x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 given that xy + yz + xz = 27 and xyz = 23.\n\nHmm, how to approach this.\n\nI remember that for optimization problems with symmetric constraints, sometimes using Lagrange multipliers is a way to go. Or perhaps, since the problem is symmetric in x, y, z, maybe the maximum occurs when two variables are equal? Maybe we can assume that two variables are equal and see.\n\nLet me consider whether the maximum occurs when two variables are equal.\n\nLet me suppose that x = y. Then, we can express everything in terms of x and z.\n\nSo, if x = y, then:\n\nConstraint 1: x\u00b2 + 2xz = 27.\n\nConstraint 2: x\u00b2 z = 23.\n\nWe can solve for z from constraint 2: z = 23 / x\u00b2.\n\nSubstitute into constraint 1:\n\nx\u00b2 + 2x*(23 / x\u00b2) = 27.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b2 + (46 / x) = 27.\n\nMultiply both sides by x:\n\nx\u00b3 + 46 = 27x.\n\nSo, x\u00b3 -27x +46 =0.\n\nWe need to solve this cubic equation for x.\n\nLet me try to find rational roots using Rational Root Theorem.

Perfect.\n\nSo, the cubic factors into (b -2)(b\u00b2 + 2b -23).\n\nSo, other roots are solutions to b\u00b2 +2b -23=0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: b = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 \u00b1 2 sqrt(6).\n\nSince b must be positive, the other roots are positive: -1 + 2 sqrt(6), approximately  -1 + 4.898 \u2248 3.898.\n\nSo, possible real positive roots: b=2, and b=-1 + 2 sqrt(6).\n\nSo, when b=2, then from a = 23/(b\u00b2) = 23/4 =5.75.\n\nSo, a=5.75, b=2, c=2.\n\nCheck the surface area: 2(ab + bc + ac) = 2*(5.75*2 + 2*2 +5.75*2 )= 2*(11.5 +4 +11.5)=2*(27)=54. That's correct.\n\nVolume: a b c=5.75 * 2 *2=23. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the other positive root, b= -1 + 2 sqrt(6) \u22483.898.\n\nThen a=23/(b\u00b2). Let's compute b\u00b2:\n\nb= -1 + 2 sqrt(6). So, b\u00b2= (-1)^2 + (2 sqrt(6))\u00b2 + 2*(-1)*(2 sqrt(6))=1 +24 -4 sqrt(6)=25 -4 sqrt(6).\n\nThen a=23/(25 -4 sqrt(6)).\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4 sqrt(6)):\n\na=23*(25 +4 sqrt(6))/[(25)^2 - (4 sqrt(6))^2] =23*(25 +4 sqrt(6))/(625 - 16*6)=23*(25 +4 sqrt(6))/(625 -96)=23*(25 +4 sqrt(6))/529.\n\nSimplify 529 is 23\u00b2, so 23 cancels:\n\na=(25 +4 sqrt(6))/23.\n\nSo, a=(25 +4 sqrt(6))/23, b=c= -1 + 2 sqrt(6).\n\nSo, now, for each case, when a=5.75, b=c=2, and when a=(25 +4 sqrt(6))/23, b=c= -1 + 2 sqrt(6).\n\nNow, for each of these, we can compute a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2.\n\nFirst case: a=5.75, b=c=2.\n\nCompute a\u00b2 + 2b\u00b2 = (5.75)^2 + 2*(2)^2.\n\n5.75 is 23/4, so (23/4)^2=529/16.\n\n2*(4)=8.\n\nSo, total a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2=529/16 +8=529/16 +128/16=657/16.\n\nSo, r\u00b2= (657/16)/4=657/(64).",

So x=2 is a root.\n\nThus, I can factor the cubic as (x - 2)(x\u00b2 + 2x -23) = 0\n\nSo, the roots are x=2, and the roots of x\u00b2 + 2x -23=0.\n\nSolving x\u00b2 + 2x -23=0:\n\nx = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 \u00b1 2*sqrt(6)\n\nWhich are approximately -1 + 4.898 \u2248 3.898 and -1 -4.898 \u2248 -5.898. Since lengths can't be negative, we discard the negative root. So, x=2, or x\u22483.898.\n\nSo, possible a=2 or a\u22483.898. Let me check which one is valid.\n\nIf a=2, then c=23/(2\u00b2)=23/4=5.75.\n\nSo, a=2, b=2, c=5.75.",

Thus, not possible.\n\nHence, \u03bc=0.\n\nIf \u03bc=0, then from equation (6):2= -\u03bb \u2192 \u03bb= -2.\n\nSubstitute into equation (1):\n\n2x = (-2)(y + z) +0 \u21922x= -2(y + z) \u2192x= -(y + z).\n\nBut x, y, z are positive, so x= -(y + z) is impossible.\n\nThus, the only possibility is that two variables are equal, and the third is different.\n\nSo, assume x=y\u2260z.\n\nThen, from the constraints:\n\nxy + yz + zx= x\u00b2 +2xz=27 ...(6)\n\nxyz= x\u00b2 z=23 ...(7)\n\nFrom (7): z=23/(x\u00b2).\n\nSubstitute into (6):\n\nx\u00b2 + 2x*(23/(x\u00b2))=27 \u2192x\u00b2 +46/x=27.\n\nMultiply both sides by x: x\u00b3 +46=27x \u2192x\u00b3 -27x +46=0.\n\nWe found earlier that x=2 is a root.\n\nFactor: (x -2)(x\u00b2 +2x -23)=0.\n\nThus, x=2 or x=(-2 \u00b1sqrt(4 +92))/2=(-2 \u00b1sqrt(96))/2=(-2 \u00b14\u221a6)/2=-1 \u00b12\u221a6.\n\nSince x>0, x= -1 +2\u221a6\u22483.898.\n\nSo, possible x=2 or x\u22483.898.\n\nCase 1: x=2.\n\nThen, z=23/(2\u00b2)=23/4=5.75.\n\nCompute x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2=2\u00b2 +2\u00b2 +5.75\u00b2=4+4+33.0625=41.0625=657/16.\n\nCase 2: x= -1 +2\u221a6.\n\nThen, z=23/(x\u00b2)=23/(25 -4\u221a6).\n\nCompute x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2=2x\u00b2 + z\u00b2.\n\n2x\u00b2=2*(25 -4\u221a6)=50 -8\u221a6.\n\nz\u00b2=(23/(25 -4\u221a6))\u00b2=529/(721 -200\u221a6).\n\nRationalize:529*(721 +200\u221a6)/(721\u00b2 - (200\u221a6)^2)=529*(721 +200\u221a6)/(519841 -240000)=529*(721 +200\u221a6)/279841.\n\nSo, z\u00b2= (381,409 +105,800\u221a6)/279,841.\n\nThus, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2=50 -8\u221a6 + (381,409 +105,800\u221a6)/279,841.\n\nCompute as before:\n\nConvert 50 to 50*279,841/279,841=13,992,050/279,841.\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2= (13,992,050 +381,409 + (-8\u221a6)*279,841 +105,800\u221a6)/279,841.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n13,992,050 +381,409=14,373,459.\n\n-8\u221a6*279,841 +105,800\u221a6= (-2,238,728 +105,800)\u221a6= (-2,132,928)\u221a6.\n\nSo, numerator=14,373,459 -2,132,928\u221a6.\n\nThus, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2= (14,373,459 -2,132,928\u221a6)/279,841.\n\nNow, compute this value numerically:\n\nCompute \u221a6\u22482.4495.\n\nSo, 2,132,928\u221a6\u22482,132,928*2.4495\u22485,230,559.\n\nSo, numerator\u224814,373,459 -5,230,559\u22489,142,900.\n\nDenominator=279,841.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2\u22489,142,900/279,841\u224832.666.\n\nWhich is less than 41.0625.",
