So, the graph of f(x) has a peak at (0, 1/2), then slopes down to (1/2, 0) on the right and (-1/2, 0) on the left, then continues upwards beyond that.\n\nSimilarly, g(x) is defined as ||x| - 1/4|. So again, starting with |x|, subtracting 1/4, then taking absolute value. Let's see: |x| - 1/4 is negative when |x| < 1/4. So, for |x| < 1/4, g(x) = -( |x| - 1/4 ) = 1/4 - |x|.

          "text1": "Wait, no, wait. At x=0, f(0) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2. So, yes, it's a V shape that's been modified. So the vertex is at (0, 0.5), and it goes down to (\u00b10.5, 0), then back up for |x|>0.5. So, two minima at (\u00b10.5, 0) and a maximum at (0,0.5). So, f(x) is a symmetrical function around the y-axis.\n\nSimilarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's analyze that. Again, starting with |x|, which is the same V-shape. Then subtracting 1/4, so |x| -1/4. Taking the absolute value of that.\n\nSo, |x| -1/4 is negative when |x| < 1/4. So, for |x| <1/4, g(x) = -( |x| -1/4 ) = 1/4 - |x|. For |x| >=1/4, g(x) = |x| -1/4.\n\nSo, the graph of g(x) is similar to f(x), but with different critical points. Let's see: g(x) is 1/4 - |x| for |x| <1/4, so it's a V upside down between x=-1/4 and x=1/4, reaching a maximum at x=0 of 1/4. Then, for |x| >=1/4, it's |x| -1/4, which is a V shape starting at (1/4, 0) and going upwards. So, it's like a diamond shape with vertices at (0, 1/4), (1/4, 0), (-1/4, 0). So, g(x) is a symmetrical function around the y-axis with a peak at x=0, y=1/4, and two minima at x=\u00b11/4, y=0.\n\nNow, let's see what f(sin(2\u03c0x)) and g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) would look like. Similarly for the other function.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe I can first analyze the composition of functions.\n\nLet me consider y = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))). Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, compute sin(2\u03c0x). Since sin is periodic with period 1, since 2\u03c0x, so x increases by 1, sin cycles. So sin(2\u03c0x) has period 1.\n\nSo, for x in [0,1], sin(2\u03c0x) goes from 0 up to 1 at x=0.25, back to 0 at x=0.5, down to -1 at x=0.75, and back to 0 at x=1.\n\nSo, sin(2\u03c0x) is a wave that oscillates between -1 and 1.\n\nThen, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is applying f to that sine wave. Since f is defined for all real numbers, but since sin(2\u03c0x) is between -1 and 1, let's see what f does to inputs between -1 and 1.\n\nGiven that f(x) is ||x| - 1/2|, let's consider x in [-1,1].\n\nFrom earlier analysis:\n\n- For |x| >=0.5, f(x) = |x| -0.5. So, for x >=0.5, f(x) = x -0.5; for x <= -0.5, f(x)= -x -0.5.\n\n- For |x| <0.5, f(x) = 0.5 - |x|.\n\nSo, when x is between -1 and 1:\n\nf(x) is 0.5 - |x| when |x| <0.5, and |x| -0.5 when |x| >=0.5.\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) would take the sine wave, which is between -1 and 1, and apply this transformation.\n\nSo, let's imagine what happens to sin(2\u03c0x) when passed through f.\n\nLet me think about the range of sin(2\u03c0x): [-1,1].\n\nSo, when sin(2\u03c0x) is between -1 and -0.5, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is -sin(2\u03c0x) -0.5.\n\nWhen sin(2\u03c0x) is between -0.5 and 0.5, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is 0.5 - |sin(2\u03c0x)|.\n\nWhen between 0.5 and 1, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is sin(2\u03c0x) -0.5.\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) would modify the sine wave as follows:\n\n- For the parts where sin(2\u03c0x) is beyond \u00b10.5, it's flipped and shifted down. So the peaks will be lower, and the troughs will be higher.\n\n- In the middle, between -0.5 and 0.5, it's a V shape pointing upwards.\n\nSo, the f(sin(2\u03c0x)) function will have a period of 1, as sin(2\u03c0x) does.\n\nThen, we apply g to this result.\n\ng(x) is ||x| -1/4|.\n\nAgain, let's think about what happens when we apply g to f(sin(2\u03c0x)).\n\nThe range of f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is from 0 up to 0.5. Because:\n\n- When |x| >=0.5, f(x) is |x| -0.5, so the maximum is when |x|=1, f(x)=0.5.\n\n- When |x| <0.5, f(x)=0.5 - |x|, so the maximum is 0.5 at x=0, decreasing to 0 at x=\u00b10.5.\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) ranges between 0 and 0.5.\n\nSo, when we apply g to this, since the input to g is between 0 and 0.5, let's see what g does.\n\ng(t) = ||t| -1/4|. Since t is between 0 and 0.5, |t| is just t. So, g(t) = |t - 1/4|.\n\nBecause t is between 0 and 0.5:\n\n- When t <1/4, g(t) = 1/4 - t.\n\n- When t >=1/4, g(t) = t -1/4.\n\nSo, g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) is equal to |f(sin(2\u03c0x)) - 1/4|.\n\nBut f(sin(2\u03c0x)) can be up to 0.5, so when f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is less than 1/4, g will be 1/4 - f(sin(2\u03c0x)), and when it's >=1/4, g is f(sin(2\u03c0x)) -1/4.\n\nThen, y =4g(...), so y is four times that.\n\nSimilarly, for the other equation, x =4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).",

But maybe it's better to consider the functions over their periods.\n\nLooking at y = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))), the inner function sin(2\u03c0x) has period 1, since the argument is 2\u03c0x. So the function sin(2\u03c0x) has a period of 1. Then f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is | sin(2\u03c0x) - 1/2 |, which will have the same period. Then g(f(...)) is | | sin(2\u03c0x) - 1/2 | - 1/4 |. So this composition will also have period 1.\n\nTherefore, y = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) will be a periodic function with period 1, so its behavior repeats every 1 unit in x.\n\nSimilarly, for x = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))), the inner function cos(3\u03c0y) has period 2/3, because the argument is 3\u03c0y, so the period is (2\u03c0)/(3\u03c0) ) = 2/3. So, the function cos(3\u03c0y) has period 2/3, then f(cos(3\u03c0y)) is | cos(3\u03c0y) - 1/2 |, which also has period 2/3. Then g(f(...)) is | | cos(3\u03c0y) - 1/2 | - 1/4 |, which also has period 2/3.

So similar to before, the output is between 0 and 1/2.\n\n3. g(f(...)) = ||f(...) - 1/4|. As before, since f(...) ranges between 0 and 1/2, g(f(...)) is |s - 1/4|, where s is in [0, 1/2].\n\n4.

So:\n\nIf t >= 1/2, f(t) = t - 1/2, which is between 0 and 1/2.\n\nIf t < 1/2, f(t) = 1/2 - t, which is between 0 and 1/2.\n\nSo f(sin(2\u03c0x)) ranges between 0 and 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|. Let's apply this to f(sin(2\u03c0x)), which is between 0 and 1/2.\n\nSo, g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) = ||f(sin(2\u03c0x)) - 1/4|.\n\nSince f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is between 0 and 1/2, which is 0 \u2264 f(...) \u2264 1/2.\n\nSo, let me let u = f(sin(2\u03c0x)), so u is in [0, 1/2].\n\nThen, g(u) = | |u| - 1/4 |. But since u is non-negative, this is |u - 1/4|.\n\nSo, when u >= 1/4, g(u) = u - 1/4. When u < 1/4, g(u) = 1/4 - u.\n\nThus, the range of g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) is as follows:\n\nWhen u ranges from 0 to 1/4: g(u) = 1/4 - u, which goes from 1/4 to 0.\n\nWhen u ranges from 1/4 to 1/2: g(u) = u - 1/4, which goes from 0 to 1/4.\n\nSo overall, g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) ranges from 0 to 1/4.\n\nTherefore, y = 4 * g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nSimilarly, for x = 4 * g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))), let's analyze the same way.\n\nFirst, f(cos(3\u03c0y)) = ||cos(3\u03c0y)| - 1/2|. Let me let v = |cos(3\u03c0y)|, which is between 0 and 1.\n\nSo f(v) = ||v - 1/2|, which is the same as f(t) earlier. So f(v) ranges between 0 and 1/2.\n\nThen, g(f(v)) = ||f(v) - 1/4|, which is similar to before. So when f(v) is between 0 and 1/2, g(f(v)) will be between 0 and 1/4.\n\nThus, x = 4 * g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nSo both y and x are in the interval [0,1].\n\nNow, considering that both functions y and x are in [0,1], perhaps the graph is confined within the unit square [0,1] x [0,1].\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of intersection points between these two curves within this square.\n\nI need to figure out how y = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) behaves as x varies, and how x = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) behaves as y varies.",

Then, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is || |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 |, which as we saw earlier, is a function that goes between 0 and 1/2. Then, g is applied to that, which as discussed, gives a range from 0 to 1/4. Multiply by 4, so y ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nSimilarly, for x = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))), as y varies, cos(3\u03c0y) oscillates between -1 and 1. The absolute value makes it between 0 and 1, then f gives between 0 and 1/2, then g gives between 0 and 1/4, and multiplied by 4 gives x in [0,1].\n\nSo, both x and y are in [0,1].\n\nNow, considering the frequencies of the sine and cosine functions.\n\nIn y = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))), the sine function has a frequency of 2\u03c0, meaning it completes one full cycle as x goes from 0 to 1. Because sin(2\u03c0x) has a period of 1. So, the function f(sin(2\u03c0x)) will have the same period as sin(2\u03c0x), i.e., 1. Then, g is applied, but g is a piecewise linear function with possible changes in slope at certain points.\n\nSimilarly, in x = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))), the argument is cos(3\u03c0y), which has a period of 2/3. So as y goes from 0 to 1, cos(3\u03c0y) completes 3/2 cycles. So, the function f(cos(3\u03c0y)) will have a period of 2/3.

So |sin(2\u03c0x)| goes through two \"humps\", each of period 1/2.\n\nThen, f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|) is || |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 |, so it's another absolute value function applied to |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2.\n\nEach hump of |sin(2\u03c0x)| will cause f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|) to have its own behavior.\n\nHmm, perhaps for each hump, f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|) will have two more humps, leading to more oscillations.\n\nBut this is getting a bit abstract.

Then, scaling by 4 would maintain the number of segments, so y would have eight segments in [0,1].\n\nSimilarly, for x = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))), the inner function is cos(3\u03c0y). The period of cos(3\u03c0y) is 2/3, so over y from 0 to 1, it completes 3/2 cycles.\n\nTaking the absolute value, |cos(3\u03c0y)|, would make it periodic with period 1/3, as the absolute value reflects the negative parts.\n\nSo |cos(3\u03c0y)| has three humps in [0,1].\n\nThen, f(|cos(3\u03c0y)|) = || |cos(3\u03c0y)| - 1/2 |, which again would have critical points where |cos(3\u03c0y)| = 1/2.\n\nSo |cos(3\u03c0y)| = 1/2 occurs when cos(3\u03c0y) = \u00b11/2.\n\nThus, 3\u03c0y = \u03c0/3, 2\u03c0/3, 4\u03c0/3, 5\u03c0/3, etc. So y = 1/9, 2/9, 4/9, 5/9, 7/9, 8/9, 10/9, 11/9, etc. But since y is in [0,1], we only consider up to y=1.\n\nSo within [0,1], for y, each 1/3 interval, we have two points where |cos(3\u03c0y)| = 1/2, except perhaps at the ends.",

So the argument to f is between 0 and 1.\n\nSo f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = || |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 |. Since |sin(2\u03c0x)| is between 0 and 1, let me substitute t = |sin(2\u03c0x)|, which is between 0 and 1.\n\nThen, f(t) = ||t - 1/2|. So:\n\nIf t >= 1/2, f(t) = t - 1/2, which is between 0 and 1/2.\n\nIf t < 1/2, f(t) = 1/2 - t, which is between 0 and 1/2.\n\nSo f(sin(2\u03c0x)) ranges between 0 and 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|. Let's apply this to f(sin(2\u03c0x)), which is between 0 and 1/2.\n\nSo, g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) = ||f(sin(2\u03c0x)) - 1/4|.\n\nSince f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is between 0 and 1/2, which is 0 \u2264 f(...) \u2264 1/2.\n\nSo, let me let u = f(sin(2\u03c0x)), so u is in [0, 1/2].\n\nThen, g(u) = | |u| - 1/4 |. But since u is non-negative, this is |u - 1/4|.\n\nSo, when u >= 1/4, g(u) = u - 1/4. When u < 1/4, g(u) = 1/4 - u.\n\nThus, the range of g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) is as follows:\n\nWhen u ranges from 0 to 1/4: g(u) = 1/4 - u, which goes from 1/4 to 0.\n\nWhen u ranges from 1/4 to 1/2: g(u) = u - 1/4, which goes from 0 to 1/4.\n\nSo overall, g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) ranges from 0 to 1/4.\n\nTherefore, y = 4 * g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nSimilarly, for x = 4 * g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))), let's analyze the same way.\n\nFirst, f(cos(3\u03c0y)) = ||cos(3\u03c0y)| - 1/2|. Let me let v = |cos(3\u03c0y)|, which is between 0 and 1.\n\nSo f(v) = ||v - 1/2|, which is the same as f(t) earlier. So f(v) ranges between 0 and 1/2.\n\nThen, g(f(v)) = ||f(v) - 1/4|, which is similar to before. So when f(v) is between 0 and 1/2, g(f(v)) will be between 0 and 1/4.\n\nThus, x = 4 * g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nSo both y and x are in the interval [0,1].\n\nNow, considering that both functions y and x are in [0,1], perhaps the graph is confined within the unit square [0,1] x [0,1].\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of intersection points between these two curves within this square.\n\nI need to figure out how y = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) behaves as x varies, and how x = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) behaves as y varies.",

So it's a V shape on [0,1], symmetric about x=1/2.\n\nSimilarly, over [-1,0], it's the same shape.\n\nSo f(sin(2\u03c0x)) will take the sine wave, which is between -1 and 1, and then apply this V-shaped function.\n\nBut since f is symmetric, it doesn't matter if sin(2\u03c0x) is positive or negative; f will treat them the same.

So the peaks will be lower, and the troughs will be higher.\n\n- In the middle, between -0.5 and 0.5, it's a V shape pointing upwards.\n\nSo, the f(sin(2\u03c0x)) function will have a period of 1, as sin(2\u03c0x) does.\n\nThen, we apply g to this result.\n\ng(x) is ||x| -1/4|.\n\nAgain, let's think about what happens when we apply g to f(sin(2\u03c0x)).\n\nThe range of f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is from 0 up to 0.5. Because:\n\n- When |x| >=0.5, f(x) is |x| -0.5, so the maximum is when |x|=1, f(x)=0.5.\n\n- When |x| <0.5, f(x)=0.5 - |x|, so the maximum is 0.5 at x=0, decreasing to 0 at x=\u00b10.5.\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) ranges between 0 and 0.5.\n\nSo, when we apply g to this, since the input to g is between 0 and 0.5, let's see what g does.\n\ng(t) = ||t| -1/4|. Since t is between 0 and 0.5, |t| is just t. So, g(t) = |t - 1/4|.\n\nBecause t is between 0 and 0.5:\n\n- When t <1/4, g(t) = 1/4 - t.\n\n- When t >=1/4, g(t) = t -1/4.\n\nSo, g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) is equal to |f(sin(2\u03c0x)) - 1/4|.\n\nBut f(sin(2\u03c0x)) can be up to 0.5, so when f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is less than 1/4, g will be 1/4 - f(sin(2\u03c0x)), and when it's >=1/4, g is f(sin(2\u03c0x)) -1/4.\n\nThen, y =4g(...), so y is four times that.\n\nSimilarly, for the other equation, x =4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).",

The absolute value makes it between 0 and 1, then f gives between 0 and 1/2, then g gives between 0 and 1/4, and multiplied by 4 gives x in [0,1].\n\nSo, both x and y are in [0,1].\n\nNow, considering the frequencies of the sine and cosine functions.\n\nIn y = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))), the sine function has a frequency of 2\u03c0, meaning it completes one full cycle as x goes from 0 to 1. Because sin(2\u03c0x) has a period of 1. So, the function f(sin(2\u03c0x)) will have the same period as sin(2\u03c0x), i.e., 1. Then, g is applied, but g is a piecewise linear function with possible changes in slope at certain points.\n\nSimilarly, in x = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))), the argument is cos(3\u03c0y), which has a period of 2/3. So as y goes from 0 to 1, cos(3\u03c0y) completes 3/2 cycles. So, the function f(cos(3\u03c0y)) will have a period of 2/3. Then, g is applied, resulting in a function with the same period.\n\nSo, to understand how many times these functions oscillate, let's see.\n\nFor y = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))):\n\nThe inner function sin(2\u03c0x) has period 1, so f(sin(2\u03c0x)) will also have period 1, as it's a composition of functions with the same period.\n\nSimilarly, g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) will have period 1, so y will have period 1.",

So |sin(2\u03c0x)| goes through two \"humps\", each of period 1/2.\n\nThen, f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|) is || |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 |, so it's another absolute value function applied to |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2.\n\nEach hump of |sin(2\u03c0x)| will cause f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|) to have its own behavior.\n\nHmm, perhaps for each hump, f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|) will have two more humps, leading to more oscillations.\n\nBut this is getting a bit abstract. Maybe I should try to compute f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|) explicitly.\n\nSo, f(t) = ||t - 1/2|.\n\nSo for each x, f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|) is || |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 |.\n\nThis function will have a V-shape wherever |sin(2\u03c0x)| crosses 1/2.\n\nSo, when |sin(2\u03c0x)| = 1/2, sin(2\u03c0x) = \u00b11/2. So 2\u03c0x = \u03c0/6, 5\u03c0/6, 7\u03c0/6, 11\u03c0/6, etc.\n\nSo x = 1/12, 5/12, 7/12, 11/12, etc.\n\nThus, within each interval of length 1, there are four points where |sin(2\u03c0x)| = 1/2, leading to four critical points where f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|) changes its slope.\n\nTherefore, f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|) is a piecewise linear function with four segments per unit interval.\n\nThen, g(f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|)) = | |f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|) - 1/4 |.\n\nSince f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|) is in [0,1/2], subtracting 1/4 would make it negative when f(...) < 1/4, so g(...) becomes 1/4 - f(...) in those regions, and f(...) - 1/4 when f(...) >= 1/4.\n\nThus, g(f(...)) is another piecewise function with possibly more segments.\n\nBut since f(...) has four segments, g(f(...)) might have more segments where it switches between the two cases.\n\nThis is getting quite complicated, but perhaps I can find the number of times y = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) oscillates between 0 and 1 as x goes from 0 to 1.\n\nGiven that f(...) has four segments, and g(f(...)) will double the number of segments in some way, perhaps leading to eight segments. Then, scaling by 4 would maintain the number of segments, so y would have eight segments in [0,1].\n\nSimilarly, for x = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))), the inner function is cos(3\u03c0y). The period of cos(3\u03c0y) is 2/3, so over y from 0 to 1, it completes 3/2 cycles.\n\nTaking the absolute value, |cos(3\u03c0y)|, would make it periodic with period 1/3, as the absolute value reflects the negative parts.\n\nSo |cos(3\u03c0y)| has three humps in [0,1].\n\nThen, f(|cos(3\u03c0y)|) = || |cos(3\u03c0y)| - 1/2 |, which again would have critical points where |cos(3\u03c0y)| = 1/2.\n\nSo |cos(3\u03c0y)| = 1/2 occurs when cos(3\u03c0y) = \u00b11/2.\n\nThus, 3\u03c0y = \u03c0/3, 2\u03c0/3, 4\u03c0/3, 5\u03c0/3, etc. So y = 1/9, 2/9, 4/9, 5/9, 7/9, 8/9, 10/9, 11/9, etc. But since y is in [0,1], we only consider up to y=1.\n\nSo within [0,1], for y, each 1/3 interval, we have two points where |cos(3\u03c0y)| = 1/2, except perhaps at the ends.",

Then, g(f(t)) = | (t - 1/2) - 1/4 | = |t - 3/4|.\n\nCase 2: t < 1/2, so f(t) = 1/2 - t.

Start with sin(2\u03c0x). The sine function with period 1 (since period is 2\u03c0 / (2\u03c0) = 1). So it's a sine wave oscillating between -1 and 1, with period 1.\n\n2. Apply f to it: f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = || sin(2\u03c0x) - 1/2 |. So let's consider the possible outputs of f(sin(2\u03c0x)).",

So, the graph of f(x) has a peak at (0, 1/2), then slopes down to (1/2, 0) on the right and (-1/2, 0) on the left, then continues upwards beyond that.\n\nSimilarly, g(x) is defined as ||x| - 1/4|. So again, starting with |x|, subtracting 1/4, then taking absolute value. Let's see: |x| - 1/4 is negative when |x| < 1/4. So, for |x| < 1/4, g(x) = -( |x| - 1/4 ) = 1/4 - |x|.

Then, for |x| >=1/4, it's |x| -1/4, which is a V shape starting at (1/4, 0) and going upwards. So, it's like a diamond shape with vertices at (0, 1/4), (1/4, 0), (-1/4, 0). So, g(x) is a symmetrical function around the y-axis with a peak at x=0, y=1/4, and two minima at x=\u00b11/4, y=0.\n\nNow, let's see what f(sin(2\u03c0x)) and g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) would look like. Similarly for the other function.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe I can first analyze the composition of functions.\n\nLet me consider y = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))). Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, compute sin(2\u03c0x). Since sin is periodic with period 1, since 2\u03c0x, so x increases by 1, sin cycles. So sin(2\u03c0x) has period 1.\n\nSo, for x in [0,1], sin(2\u03c0x) goes from 0 up to 1 at x=0.25, back to 0 at x=0.5, down to -1 at x=0.75, and back to 0 at x=1.\n\nSo, sin(2\u03c0x) is a wave that oscillates between -1 and 1.\n\nThen, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is applying f to that sine wave. Since f is defined for all real numbers, but since sin(2\u03c0x) is between -1 and 1, let's see what f does to inputs between -1 and 1.\n\nGiven that f(x) is ||x| - 1/2|, let's consider x in [-1,1].\n\nFrom earlier analysis:\n\n- For |x| >=0.5, f(x) = |x| -0.5. So, for x >=0.5, f(x) = x -0.5; for x <= -0.5, f(x)= -x -0.5.\n\n- For |x| <0.5, f(x) = 0.5 - |x|.\n\nSo, when x is between -1 and 1:\n\nf(x) is 0.5 - |x| when |x| <0.5, and |x| -0.5 when |x| >=0.5.\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) would take the sine wave, which is between -1 and 1, and apply this transformation.\n\nSo, let's imagine what happens to sin(2\u03c0x) when passed through f.\n\nLet me think about the range of sin(2\u03c0x): [-1,1].\n\nSo, when sin(2\u03c0x) is between -1 and -0.5, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is -sin(2\u03c0x) -0.5.\n\nWhen sin(2\u03c0x) is between -0.5 and 0.5, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is 0.5 - |sin(2\u03c0x)|.\n\nWhen between 0.5 and 1, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is sin(2\u03c0x) -0.5.\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) would modify the sine wave as follows:\n\n- For the parts where sin(2\u03c0x) is beyond \u00b10.5, it's flipped and shifted down. So the peaks will be lower, and the troughs will be higher.\n\n- In the middle, between -0.5 and 0.5, it's a V shape pointing upwards.\n\nSo, the f(sin(2\u03c0x)) function will have a period of 1, as sin(2\u03c0x) does.\n\nThen, we apply g to this result.\n\ng(x) is ||x| -1/4|.\n\nAgain, let's think about what happens when we apply g to f(sin(2\u03c0x)).\n\nThe range of f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is from 0 up to 0.5. Because:\n\n- When |x| >=0.5, f(x) is |x| -0.5, so the maximum is when |x|=1, f(x)=0.5.\n\n- When |x| <0.5, f(x)=0.5 - |x|, so the maximum is 0.5 at x=0, decreasing to 0 at x=\u00b10.5.\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) ranges between 0 and 0.5.\n\nSo, when we apply g to this, since the input to g is between 0 and 0.5, let's see what g does.\n\ng(t) = ||t| -1/4|. Since t is between 0 and 0.5, |t| is just t. So, g(t) = |t - 1/4|.\n\nBecause t is between 0 and 0.5:\n\n- When t <1/4, g(t) = 1/4 - t.\n\n- When t >=1/4, g(t) = t -1/4.\n\nSo, g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) is equal to |f(sin(2\u03c0x)) - 1/4|.\n\nBut f(sin(2\u03c0x)) can be up to 0.5, so when f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is less than 1/4, g will be 1/4 - f(sin(2\u03c0x)), and when it's >=1/4, g is f(sin(2\u03c0x)) -1/4.\n\nThen, y =4g(...), so y is four times that.\n\nSimilarly, for the other equation, x =4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).",

But |w - 1/4| is already non-negative, so g(w) = |w - 1/4|.\n\nThus, g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) = | | sin(2\u03c0x) - 1/2 | - 1/4 |.\n\nSo, y = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) becomes y = 4 * | | sin(2\u03c0x) - 1/2 | - 1/4 |.\n\nSimilarly, let's analyze the other equation: x = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nSo, f(cos(3\u03c0y)) = | cos(3\u03c0y) - 1/2 |. Then g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) = | | cos(3\u03c0y) - 1/2 | - 1/4 |.\n\nThus, x = 4 * | | cos(3\u03c0y) - 1/2 | - 1/4 |.\n\nNow, the problem is to find all (x, y) such that y = 4 * | | sin(2\u03c0x) - 1/2 | - 1/4 | and x = 4 * | | cos(3\u03c0y) - 1/2 | - 1/4 |.\n\nThis seems quite involved. Maybe I should try to understand the behavior of these functions by analyzing their possible outputs and how they relate.\n\nLet's consider the first equation, y = 4 * | | sin(2\u03c0x) - 1/2 | - 1/4 |.\n\nLet me denote A = | sin(2\u03c0x) - 1/2 |. So y = 4 * | A - 1/4 |.\n\nWhat is the range of A? sin(2\u03c0x) ranges from -1 to 1. So, sin(2\u03c0x) - 1/2 ranges from -3/2 to 1/2. Taking the absolute value, A ranges from 0 to 3/2.\n\nSo, A \u2208 [0, 3/2].\n\nThen, | A - 1/4 | will range from |0 - 1/4| = 1/4 to |3/2 - 1/4| = 5/4. So, |A - 1/4| \u2208 [1/4, 5/4].\n\nMultiplying by 4, y \u2208 [1, 5].\n\nSo the possible values of y are between 1 and 5.\n\nSimilarly, let's look at the second equation: x = 4 * | | cos(3\u03c0y) - 1/2 | - 1/4 |.\n\nLet me denote B = | cos(3\u03c0y) - 1/2 |. So, x = 4 * | B - 1/4 |.\n\ncos(3\u03c0y) ranges from -1 to 1, so cos(3\u03c0y) - 1/2 ranges from -3/2 to 1/2. Taking absolute value, B \u2208 [0, 3/2].\n\nTherefore, | B - 1/4 | \u2208 [1/4, 5/4], so x \u2208 [1, 5].\n\nThus, both x and y are in the interval [1, 5].",

Then, g(f(t)) = | (t - 1/2) - 1/4 | = |t - 3/4|.\n\nCase 2: t < 1/2, so f(t) = 1/2 - t.

So the peaks will be lower, and the troughs will be higher.\n\n- In the middle, between -0.5 and 0.5, it's a V shape pointing upwards.\n\nSo, the f(sin(2\u03c0x)) function will have a period of 1, as sin(2\u03c0x) does.\n\nThen, we apply g to this result.\n\ng(x) is ||x| -1/4|.\n\nAgain, let's think about what happens when we apply g to f(sin(2\u03c0x)).\n\nThe range of f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is from 0 up to 0.5. Because:\n\n- When |x| >=0.5, f(x) is |x| -0.5, so the maximum is when |x|=1, f(x)=0.5.\n\n- When |x| <0.5, f(x)=0.5 - |x|, so the maximum is 0.5 at x=0, decreasing to 0 at x=\u00b10.5.\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) ranges between 0 and 0.5.\n\nSo, when we apply g to this, since the input to g is between 0 and 0.5, let's see what g does.\n\ng(t) = ||t| -1/4|. Since t is between 0 and 0.5, |t| is just t. So, g(t) = |t - 1/4|.\n\nBecause t is between 0 and 0.5:\n\n- When t <1/4, g(t) = 1/4 - t.\n\n- When t >=1/4, g(t) = t -1/4.\n\nSo, g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) is equal to |f(sin(2\u03c0x)) - 1/4|.\n\nBut f(sin(2\u03c0x)) can be up to 0.5, so when f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is less than 1/4, g will be 1/4 - f(sin(2\u03c0x)), and when it's >=1/4, g is f(sin(2\u03c0x)) -1/4.\n\nThen, y =4g(...), so y is four times that.\n\nSimilarly, for the other equation, x =4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).",

But for |x| < 1/2, f(x) = -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|.\n\nSo, f(x) looks like a W between -1/2 and 1/2, peaking at 1/2, and then V-shaped outside that interval, starting at 1/2 and going up with slope 1 on either side beyond |x| =1/2. So, the graph of f(x) has a peak at (0, 1/2), then slopes down to (1/2, 0) on the right and (-1/2, 0) on the left, then continues upwards beyond that.\n\nSimilarly, g(x) is defined as ||x| - 1/4|. So again, starting with |x|, subtracting 1/4, then taking absolute value. Let's see: |x| - 1/4 is negative when |x| < 1/4. So, for |x| < 1/4, g(x) = -( |x| - 1/4 ) = 1/4 - |x|. For |x| >= 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4. So, the graph of g(x) will have a peak at (0, 1/4), then slope down to (1/4, 0) and (-1/4, 0), then slope up beyond that.\n\nOkay, so f and g are both V-shaped with a W in the center. Now, the functions we're dealing with are y = 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).

An intersection occurs when a point (a, b) satisfies both equations: so 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0a))) = b and 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0b))) = a.",

Taking the absolute value, A ranges from 0 to 3/2.\n\nSo, A \u2208 [0, 3/2].\n\nThen, | A - 1/4 | will range from |0 - 1/4| = 1/4 to |3/2 - 1/4| = 5/4.

So, f(x) is a symmetrical function around the y-axis.\n\nSimilarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's analyze that. Again, starting with |x|, which is the same V-shape. Then subtracting 1/4, so |x| -1/4.

For |x| >=1/4, g(x) = |x| -1/4.\n\nSo, the graph of g(x) is similar to f(x), but with different critical points. Let's see: g(x) is 1/4 - |x| for |x| <1/4, so it's a V upside down between x=-1/4 and x=1/4, reaching a maximum at x=0 of 1/4. Then, for |x| >=1/4, it's |x| -1/4, which is a V shape starting at (1/4, 0) and going upwards. So, it's like a diamond shape with vertices at (0, 1/4), (1/4, 0), (-1/4, 0). So, g(x) is a symmetrical function around the y-axis with a peak at x=0, y=1/4, and two minima at x=\u00b11/4, y=0.\n\nNow, let's see what f(sin(2\u03c0x)) and g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) would look like. Similarly for the other function.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe I can first analyze the composition of functions.\n\nLet me consider y = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))). Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, compute sin(2\u03c0x). Since sin is periodic with period 1, since 2\u03c0x, so x increases by 1, sin cycles. So sin(2\u03c0x) has period 1.\n\nSo, for x in [0,1], sin(2\u03c0x) goes from 0 up to 1 at x=0.25, back to 0 at x=0.5, down to -1 at x=0.75, and back to 0 at x=1.\n\nSo, sin(2\u03c0x) is a wave that oscillates between -1 and 1.\n\nThen, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is applying f to that sine wave. Since f is defined for all real numbers, but since sin(2\u03c0x) is between -1 and 1, let's see what f does to inputs between -1 and 1.\n\nGiven that f(x) is ||x| - 1/2|, let's consider x in [-1,1].\n\nFrom earlier analysis:\n\n- For |x| >=0.5, f(x) = |x| -0.5. So, for x >=0.5, f(x) = x -0.5; for x <= -0.5, f(x)= -x -0.5.\n\n- For |x| <0.5, f(x) = 0.5 - |x|.\n\nSo, when x is between -1 and 1:\n\nf(x) is 0.5 - |x| when |x| <0.5, and |x| -0.5 when |x| >=0.5.\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) would take the sine wave, which is between -1 and 1, and apply this transformation.\n\nSo, let's imagine what happens to sin(2\u03c0x) when passed through f.\n\nLet me think about the range of sin(2\u03c0x): [-1,1].\n\nSo, when sin(2\u03c0x) is between -1 and -0.5, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is -sin(2\u03c0x) -0.5.\n\nWhen sin(2\u03c0x) is between -0.5 and 0.5, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is 0.5 - |sin(2\u03c0x)|.\n\nWhen between 0.5 and 1, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is sin(2\u03c0x) -0.5.\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) would modify the sine wave as follows:\n\n- For the parts where sin(2\u03c0x) is beyond \u00b10.5, it's flipped and shifted down. So the peaks will be lower, and the troughs will be higher.\n\n- In the middle, between -0.5 and 0.5, it's a V shape pointing upwards.\n\nSo, the f(sin(2\u03c0x)) function will have a period of 1, as sin(2\u03c0x) does.\n\nThen, we apply g to this result.\n\ng(x) is ||x| -1/4|.\n\nAgain, let's think about what happens when we apply g to f(sin(2\u03c0x)).\n\nThe range of f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is from 0 up to 0.5. Because:\n\n- When |x| >=0.5, f(x) is |x| -0.5, so the maximum is when |x|=1, f(x)=0.5.\n\n- When |x| <0.5, f(x)=0.5 - |x|, so the maximum is 0.5 at x=0, decreasing to 0 at x=\u00b10.5.\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) ranges between 0 and 0.5.\n\nSo, when we apply g to this, since the input to g is between 0 and 0.5, let's see what g does.\n\ng(t) = ||t| -1/4|. Since t is between 0 and 0.5, |t| is just t. So, g(t) = |t - 1/4|.\n\nBecause t is between 0 and 0.5:\n\n- When t <1/4, g(t) = 1/4 - t.\n\n- When t >=1/4, g(t) = t -1/4.\n\nSo, g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) is equal to |f(sin(2\u03c0x)) - 1/4|.\n\nBut f(sin(2\u03c0x)) can be up to 0.5, so when f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is less than 1/4, g will be 1/4 - f(sin(2\u03c0x)), and when it's >=1/4, g is f(sin(2\u03c0x)) -1/4.\n\nThen, y =4g(...), so y is four times that.\n\nSimilarly, for the other equation, x =4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).",

Because sin(2\u03c0x) has a period of 1. So, the function f(sin(2\u03c0x)) will have the same period as sin(2\u03c0x), i.e., 1. Then, g is applied, but g is a piecewise linear function with possible changes in slope at certain points.\n\nSimilarly, in x = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))), the argument is cos(3\u03c0y), which has a period of 2/3.

Start with sin(2\u03c0x). The sine function with period 1 (since period is 2\u03c0 / (2\u03c0) = 1). So it's a sine wave oscillating between -1 and 1, with period 1.\n\n2. Apply f to it: f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = || sin(2\u03c0x) - 1/2 |. So let's consider the possible outputs of f(sin(2\u03c0x)).",

So, the graph of f(x) has a peak at (0, 1/2), then slopes down to (1/2, 0) on the right and (-1/2, 0) on the left, then continues upwards beyond that.\n\nSimilarly, g(x) is defined as ||x| - 1/4|. So again, starting with |x|, subtracting 1/4, then taking absolute value. Let's see: |x| - 1/4 is negative when |x| < 1/4. So, for |x| < 1/4, g(x) = -( |x| - 1/4 ) = 1/4 - |x|. For |x| >= 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4.
