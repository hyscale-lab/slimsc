So, midpoints are (0,0,c) and (0,0,-c), which are symmetric with respect to the origin.\n\nSimilarly, the midpoint of AC is [(-a + a)/2, (b + b)/2, (c - c)/2] = (0, b, 0), and midpoint of BD is [(-a + a)/2, (-b - b)/2, (c - c)/2] = (0, -b, 0). These are symmetric as well.\n\nHm, so this setup could work. Let's assign coordinates as follows:\n\nA: (a, b, c)\nB: (-a, -b, c)\nC: (-a, b, -c)\nD: (a, -b, -c)\n\nNow, let's compute the lengths of the edges in terms of a, b, c.\n\nCompute AB: distance between A and B.\n\nA is (a, b, c), B is (-a, -b, c).\n\nAB^2 = (a + a)^2 + (b + b)^2 + (c - c)^2 = (2a)^2 + (2b)^2 + 0 = 4a\u00b2 + 4b\u00b2.\n\nGiven that AB = \u221a41, so AB\u00b2 = 41.\n\nTherefore, 4a\u00b2 + 4b\u00b2 = 41 => a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41/4.

(2)\n\nSimilarly, compute BC: distance between B and C.\n\nB is (-a, -b, c), C is (-a, b, -c).\n\nBC^2 = (-a + a)^2 + (b + b)^2 + (-c - c)^2 = 0 + (2b)^2 + (-2c)^2 = 4b\u00b2 + 4c\u00b2.\n\nGiven BC = \u221a89, so BC\u00b2 = 89.\n\nThus, 4b\u00b2 + 4c\u00b2 = 89 => b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4. (3)\n\nNow, we have three equations:\n\n1) a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41/4\n\n2) a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 20\n\n3) b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nWe can solve these equations for a\u00b2, b\u00b2, c\u00b2.\n\nLet me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 20 - 41/4\n\nSo, c\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (80/4 - 41/4) = 39/4.\n\nBut from equation 3, b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nc\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 39/4\n\nc\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nAdding these two equations:\n\n2c\u00b2 = (39 + 89)/4 = 128/4 = 32 => c\u00b2 = 16 => c = 4 or c = -4.\n\nSince c is squared, it doesn't matter; we can take c = 4.\n\nNow, from equation 3, b\u00b2 + 16 = 89/4 => b\u00b2 = 89/4 - 16 = 89/4 - 64/4 = 25/4 => b = 5/2 or b = -5/2.\n\nSimilarly, from equation 1, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41/4. Since b\u00b2 =25/4, a\u00b2 = 41/4 -25/4 =16/4=4 => a=2 or a=-2.\n\nSo, we have a=2, b=5/2, c=4.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates are:\n\nA: (2, 5/2, 4)\n\nB: (-2, -5/2, 4)\n\nC: (-2, 5/2, -4)\n\nD: (2, -5/2, -4)",

Given AC = sqrt(80), so 2*sqrt(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(80), so sqrt(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(80)/2 = (4*sqrt(5))/2 = 2*sqrt(5). So a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (2*sqrt(5))\u00b2 = 20.\n\nSimilarly, BC: distance between B and C. B is (-a, -b, c), C is (-a, b, -c). So the distance is sqrt[ (-a - (-a))\u00b2 + (-b - b)^2 + (c - (-c))\u00b2 ] = sqrt[ 0 + (-2b)^2 + (2c)^2 ] = sqrt[4b\u00b2 + 4c\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2). Given BC = sqrt(89), so 2*sqrt(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(89), so sqrt(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(89)/2, so b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSo now I have three equations:\n\n1) a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41/4\n\n2) a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 20\n\n3) b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nI can solve these equations for a\u00b2, b\u00b2, c\u00b2.\n\nLet me subtract equation 1 from equation 2: (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 20 - 41/4. So c\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (80/4 - 41/4) = 39/4.\n\nBut from equation 3, b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSo now I have:\n\nc\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 39/4\n\nc\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nAdding these two equations: 2c\u00b2 = (39 + 89)/4 = 128/4 = 32. So c\u00b2 = 16, so c = 4 or -4.\n\nThen, from equation 3: b\u00b2 + 16 = 89/4. So b\u00b2 = 89/4 - 16 = 89/4 - 64/4 = 25/4. So b = 5/2 or -5/2.\n\nFrom equation 1: a\u00b2 + (25/4) = 41/4. So a\u00b2 = (41 -25)/4 = 16/4 = 4. So a = 2 or -2.\n\nSo now I have:\n\na\u00b2 = 4 => a = 2\n\nb\u00b2 =25/4 => b=5/2\n\nc\u00b2=16 => c=4\n\nSo, now I can assign coordinates:\n\nA = (2, 5/2, 4)\n\nB = (-2, -5/2, 4)\n\nC = (-2, 5/2, -4)\n\nD = (2, -5/2, -4)",

So, midpoints are (0,0,c) and (0,0,-c), which are symmetric with respect to the origin.\n\nSimilarly, the midpoint of AC is [(-a + a)/2, (b + b)/2, (c - c)/2] = (0, b, 0), and midpoint of BD is [(-a + a)/2, (-b - b)/2, (c - c)/2] = (0, -b, 0).

Let's assign coordinates as follows:\n\nA: (a, b, c)\nB: (-a, -b, c)\nC: (-a, b, -c)\nD: (a, -b, -c)\n\nNow, let's compute the lengths of the edges in terms of a, b, c.\n\nCompute AB: distance between A and B.\n\nA is (a, b, c), B is (-a, -b, c).\n\nAB^2 = (a + a)^2 + (b + b)^2 + (c - c)^2 = (2a)^2 + (2b)^2 + 0 = 4a\u00b2 + 4b\u00b2.\n\nGiven that AB = \u221a41, so AB\u00b2 = 41.\n\nTherefore, 4a\u00b2 + 4b\u00b2 = 41 => a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41/4.

Substitute z\u00b2 = y\u00b2 +9.75 into equation 3.\n\nSo, y\u00b2 + (y\u00b2 +9.75) =22.25 \u2192 2y\u00b2 +9.75=22.25 \u2192 2y\u00b2=22.25-9.75=12.5 \u2192 y\u00b2=6.25 \u2192 y=2.5 or y=-2.5, but since it's squared, we'll take y=2.5.\n\nThen, from equation 1: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =10.25 \u2192 x\u00b2=10.25 -6.25=4 \u2192 x=2 or x=-2.\n\nFrom equation 3, z\u00b2 = y\u00b2 +9.75=6.25 +9.75=16 \u2192 z=4 or z=-4.\n\nSo, x=2, y=2.5, z=4.\n\nSo, the coordinates are:\n\nA: (2, 2.5, 4)\n\nB: (-2, -2.5,4)\n\nC: (-2,2.5,-4)\n\nD: (2, -2.5, -4)\n\nSo, now I can compute the volume of tetrahedron ABCD using the coordinates.\n\nThe formula for the volume of a tetrahedron given coordinates is (1/6)*| scalar triple product of vectors AB, AC, AD |.\n\nBut since I have all coordinates, maybe it's easier to compute vectors AB, AC, AD, then compute the scalar triple product.",

So sqrt[ (a - (-a))^2 + (b - (-b))^2 + (c - c)^2 ] = sqrt[ (2a)^2 + (2b)^2 + 0 ] = 2*sqrt(a^2 + b^2). So AB = 2*sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = sqrt(41). So 2*sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = sqrt(41), which implies sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = sqrt(41)/2, so a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41/4.\n\nSimilarly, AC: distance between A and C. Coordinates of A: (a, b, c), C: (-a, b, -c). So distance is sqrt[ (a - (-a))\u00b2 + (b - b)\u00b2 + (c - (-c))\u00b2 ] = sqrt[ (2a)^2 + 0 + (2c)^2 ] = 2*sqrt(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2). Given AC = sqrt(80), so 2*sqrt(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(80), so sqrt(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(80)/2 = (4*sqrt(5))/2 = 2*sqrt(5). So a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (2*sqrt(5))\u00b2 = 20.\n\nSimilarly, BC: distance between B and C. B is (-a, -b, c), C is (-a, b, -c). So the distance is sqrt[ (-a - (-a))\u00b2 + (-b - b)^2 + (c - (-c))\u00b2 ] = sqrt[ 0 + (-2b)^2 + (2c)^2 ] = sqrt[4b\u00b2 + 4c\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2).

So, 5129/41=125 +4/41=125.09756.\n\nSo, 125.09756 -2 s sqrt(2024/41)=41.\n\nSubtract 41: 125.09756 -41=84.09756= (5129/41 -41)=5129/41 -1681/41=(5129-1681)/41=3448/41=84.09756.\n\nSo, 84.09756= -2 s sqrt(2024/41).\n\nSo, solving for s:\n\ns= - (84.09756)/(2 sqrt(2024/41)).\n\nLet me compute sqrt(2024/41): sqrt(49.3658)= approx7.026.\n\nBut let me do it more precisely.\n\n2024=8*11*23, 41 is prime. So sqrt(2024/41)=sqrt(2024)/sqrt(41)=sqrt(2024)/sqrt(41)= approx sqrt(49.3658)=~7.026.\n\nBut let me see if 2024 is divisible by 41: 41*49=2009, 2024-2009=15, so no.\n\nSo, sqrt(2024/41)=sqrt(2024)/sqrt(41)=sqrt(2024)/sqrt(41).\n\nBut 2024=4*506=4*2*253=8*253. 253 is 11*23. So, sqrt(2024)=sqrt(4*506)=2 sqrt(506). So, sqrt(2024/41)=2 sqrt(506/41).\n\n506 \u00f741: 41*12=492, 506-492=14, so 506=41*12 +14. Not a multiple. So, 506/41=12 +14/41.\n\nSo, sqrt(506/41)=sqrt(12 +14/41)=sqrt(12.3415)= approx3.513.\n\nSo, sqrt(2024/41)=2*3.513\u22487.026.\n\nBut perhaps I can write it as 2 sqrt(506/41).\n\nSo, s= - (84.09756)/(2 * 2 sqrt(506/41)) )=",

So square both sides:\n\n(p - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 89.\n\nBut we know that p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 80, so substituting:\n\n(p - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + (80 - p\u00b2) = 89.\n\nExpanding (p - sqrt(41))\u00b2: p\u00b2 - 2 p sqrt(41) + 41.\n\nSo:\n\np\u00b2 - 2 p sqrt(41) + 41 + 80 - p\u00b2 = 89\n\nSimplify:\n\n(-2 p sqrt(41)) + 121 = 89\n\nSo:\n\n-2 p sqrt(41) = 89 - 121 = -32\n\nDivide both sides by -2:\n\np sqrt(41) = 16 \u2192 p = 16 / sqrt(41)\n\nRationalizing the denominator:\n\np = (16 sqrt(41)) / 41\n\nSo p = (16\u221a41)/41\n\nNow, from p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 80:\n\np\u00b2 = (256 * 41) / (41\u00b2) )= 256 / 41\n\nSo q\u00b2 = 80 - (256 / 41) = (80 *41 - 256) /41 = (3280 - 256)/41 = 3024 /41\n\nSo q = sqrt(3024 / 41) = sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41)\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024). 3024 factors: 3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 *7 \u2192 sqrt(3024) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21)\n\nSo q = (12 sqrt(21)) / sqrt(41) = (12 sqrt(861)) /41",
