For tangency, the normals must be scalar multiples. So,\n\n( (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6 ) * x / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6 ) * y / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), z ) = \u03bb (x, y, z)\n\nSo, each component must satisfy:\n\n( (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6 ) * x ) / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = \u03bb x\n\nSimilarly for y:\n\n( (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6 ) * y ) / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = \u03bb y\n\nAnd for z:\n\nz = \u03bb z\n\nAssuming x, y, z are not zero, we can divide.\n\nFrom the z component:\n\nEither z = 0 or \u03bb = 1.\n\nBut if z = 0, then from the torus equation, (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6)^2 = 9. So, sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 6 \u00b13. So, sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)=9 or 3.\n\nBut the sphere at z=0 is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 121. So, if sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)=9 or 3, which are both less than 121, but in the case of the sphere, points on z=0 with x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=121 don't satisfy the torus equation.

So, the direction of the normal vector is:\n\n( (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6 ) * x / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6 ) * y / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), z )\n\nNow, for the sphere, the normal is (x, y, z). For tangency, the normals must be scalar multiples. So,\n\n( (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6 ) * x / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6 ) * y / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), z ) = \u03bb (x, y, z)\n\nSo, each component must satisfy:\n\n( (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6 ) * x ) / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = \u03bb x\n\nSimilarly for y:\n\n( (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6 ) * y ) / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = \u03bb y\n\nAnd for z:\n\nz = \u03bb z\n\nAssuming x, y, z are not zero, we can divide.\n\nFrom the z component:\n\nEither z = 0 or \u03bb = 1.\n\nBut if z = 0, then from the torus equation, (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6)^2 = 9. So, sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 6 \u00b13. So, sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)=9 or 3.\n\nBut the sphere at z=0 is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 121. So, if sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)=9 or 3, which are both less than 121, but in the case of the sphere, points on z=0 with x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=121 don't satisfy the torus equation. So perhaps z \u22600, which would imply \u03bb=1.\n\nSo, from the x and y components, assuming x \u22600 and y \u22600,\n\n( (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6 ) / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) ) = \u03bb\n\nBut since \u03bb=1, we have:\n\n(sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6 ) / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) ) = 1\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2):\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6 = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-6 = 0\n\nThat's impossible. So, that suggests that either x or y is zero. Let me check that.\n\nCase 1: x =0.\n\nThen, from the sphere equation: 0 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 121.\n\nFrom the torus equation: (sqrt(0 + y\u00b2) -6)^2 + z\u00b2 = 9.\n\nSo, (|y| -6)^2 + z\u00b2 =9.\n\nBut from the sphere, y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 121.\n\nSo, substitute z\u00b2 = 121 - y\u00b2 into the torus equation:\n\n(|y| -6)^2 + (121 - y\u00b2) =9\n\nExpand (|y| -6)^2: y\u00b2 -12|y| +36.\n\nSo,\n\ny\u00b2 -12|y| +36 +121 - y\u00b2 =9\n\nSimplify:\n\n-12|y| +157 =9\n\nSo,\n\n-12|y| = -148\n\n|y| = 148 /12 = 37/3 \u224812.333...\n\nBut since y\u00b2 = (37/3)^2\u2248152, which is greater than 121, the sphere's radius squared. So, this is impossible. Hence, no solution when x=0.\n\nCase 2: y=0.\n\nSimilarly, from sphere: x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =121.\n\nFrom torus: (sqrt(x\u00b2 +0) -6)^2 + z\u00b2=9.\n\nSo, (|x| -6)^2 + z\u00b2=9.\n\nFrom sphere: z\u00b2=121 -x\u00b2.\n\nSubstitute into torus equation:\n\n(|x| -6)^2 + 121 -x\u00b2=9\n\nExpand (|x| -6)^2: x\u00b2 -12|x| +36.\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2 -12|x| +36 +121 -x\u00b2=9\n\nSimplify:\n\n-12|x| +157=9\n\n-12|x|= -148\n\n|x|=148/12=37/3\u224812.333...\n\nAgain, x\u00b2=(37/3)^2\u2248152>121, which is impossible. So, no solution when y=0.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the only possibility is z=0. But earlier, that led to a contradiction as well. So perhaps my approach is wrong.",

For tangency, the normals must be scalar multiples. So,\n\n( (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6 ) * x / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6 ) * y / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), z ) = \u03bb (x, y, z)\n\nSo, each component must satisfy:\n\n( (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6 ) * x ) / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = \u03bb x\n\nSimilarly for y:\n\n( (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6 ) * y ) / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = \u03bb y\n\nAnd for z:\n\nz = \u03bb z\n\nAssuming x, y, z are not zero, we can divide.\n\nFrom the z component:\n\nEither z = 0 or \u03bb = 1.\n\nBut if z = 0, then from the torus equation, (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6)^2 = 9. So, sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 6 \u00b13. So, sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)=9 or 3.\n\nBut the sphere at z=0 is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 121. So, if sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)=9 or 3, which are both less than 121, but in the case of the sphere, points on z=0 with x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=121 don't satisfy the torus equation. So perhaps z \u22600, which would imply \u03bb=1.\n\nSo, from the x and y components, assuming x \u22600 and y \u22600,\n\n( (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6 ) / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) ) = \u03bb\n\nBut since \u03bb=1, we have:\n\n(sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6 ) / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) ) = 1\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2):\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6 = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-6 = 0\n\nThat's impossible. So, that suggests that either x or y is zero.

So, this is impossible. Hence, no solution when x=0.\n\nCase 2: y=0.\n\nSimilarly, from sphere: x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =121.\n\nFrom torus: (sqrt(x\u00b2 +0) -6)^2 + z\u00b2=9.\n\nSo, (|x| -6)^2 + z\u00b2=9.\n\nFrom sphere: z\u00b2=121 -x\u00b2.\n\nSubstitute into torus equation:\n\n(|x| -6)^2 + 121 -x\u00b2=9\n\nExpand (|x| -6)^2: x\u00b2 -12|x| +36.\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2 -12|x| +36 +121 -x\u00b2=9\n\nSimplify:\n\n-12|x| +157=9\n\n-12|x|= -148\n\n|x|=148/12=37/3\u224812.333...\n\nAgain, x\u00b2=(37/3)^2\u2248152>121, which is impossible. So, no solution when y=0.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the only possibility is z=0. But earlier, that led to a contradiction as well. So perhaps my approach is wrong.",
