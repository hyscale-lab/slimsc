Since D(0,0) is on the circle, plugging into the equation: 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + c = 0, so c=0.\n\nSo the equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx + 2fy = 0.\n\nNow, plug in point A(0,107): 0 + 107\u00b2 + 0 + 2f*107 = 0.\n\n107\u00b2 + 214f = 0 \u2192 214f = -107\u00b2 \u2192 f = -(107\u00b2)/(214) = -(107)/2 = -53.5.\n\nSo f = -53.5.\n\nNow, plug in point H(x,17): x\u00b2 + 17\u00b2 + 2g x + 2*(-53.5)*17 = 0.\n\nCompute 2*(-53.5)*17: that's -107*17 = -1819.\n\nSo equation: x\u00b2 + 289 + 2gx - 1819 = 0 \u2192 x\u00b2 + 2gx - 1530 = 0.\n\nSimilarly, plug in point G(x + 184,17):\n\n(x + 184)\u00b2 + 17\u00b2 + 2g(x + 184) + 2*(-53.5)*17 = 0.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n(x + 184)^2 = x\u00b2 + 368x + 184\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 368x + 33856.\n\n17\u00b2 = 289.\n\n2g(x + 184) = 2gx + 368g.\n\n2*(-53.5)*17 = same as before, which is -1819.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nx\u00b2 + 368x + 33856 + 289 + 2gx + 368g - 1819 = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b2 + (368x + 2gx) + (33856 + 289 - 1819) + 368g = 0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx\u00b2 + x(368 + 2g) + (33856 + 289 - 1819) + 368g = 0.\n\nCalculate the constants: 33856 + 289 = 34145; 34145 - 1819 = 32326.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 + x(368 + 2g) + 32326 + 368g = 0.\n\nBut from point H, we had x\u00b2 + 2gx - 1530 = 0.\n\nSo, let's write both equations:\n\n1. From H: x\u00b2 + 2gx - 1530 = 0.\n\n2. From G: x\u00b2 + (368 + 2g)x + 32326 + 368g = 0.\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(x\u00b2 + (368 + 2g)x + 32326 + 368g) - (x\u00b2 + 2gx -1530) = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b2 - x\u00b2 + (368 + 2g - 2g)x + (32326 + 368g + 1530) = 0.\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n368x + 33856 + 368g = 0.",

As before, since D(0,0) is on the circle, c=0. So, equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +2gx +2fy=0.\n\nPlugging in A(0,107):\n\n0 + 107\u00b2 + 0 +2f*107=0 \u2192 11449 +214f=0 \u2192 f= -11449/214= -53.5. So, same as before.\n\nNow, plugging in H(-a,17):\n\n(-a)^2 +17\u00b2 +2g*(-a) +2*(-53.5)*17=0 \u2192 a\u00b2 +289 -2ga -1819=0 \u2192 a\u00b2 -2ga -1530=0.\n\nSimilarly, plugging in G(-a +184,17):\n\n(-a +184)^2 +17\u00b2 +2g*(-a +184) +2*(-53.5)*17=0.\n\nLet's compute each term:\n\n(-a +184)^2 = a\u00b2 -368a + 33856.\n\n17\u00b2=289.\n\n2g*(-a +184)= -2ga +368g.\n\n2*(-53.5)*17= -1819.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\na\u00b2 -368a +33856 +289 -2ga +368g -1819=0.\n\nSimplify:\n\na\u00b2 -368a + (33856 +289 -1819) + (-2ga +368g)=0.\n\nCompute the constants: 33856 +289=34145; 34145-1819=32326.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\na\u00b2 -368a +32326 -2ga +368g=0.\n\nBut from point H, we have equation a\u00b2 -2ga -1530=0.\n\nSo, subtract equation from H:\n\n(a\u00b2 -368a +32326 -2ga +368g) - (a\u00b2 -2ga -1530)=0.\n\nSimplify:\n\na\u00b2 -368a +32326 -2ga +368g -a\u00b2 +2ga +1530=0.\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n-368a +32326 +368g +1530=0.\n\nCombine constants: 32326 +1530=33856.\n\nSo:\n\n-368a +33856 +368g=0 \u2192 368g -368a = -33856.\n\nDivide both sides by 368:\n\ng -a = -33856 /368 = -92.\n\nSo, g = a -92.\n\nNow, from equation H: a\u00b2 -2ga -1530=0.\n\nSubstitute g= a -92:\n\na\u00b2 -2*(a -92)*a -1530=0.\n\nCompute:\n\na\u00b2 -2a\u00b2 +184a -1530=0 \u2192 -a\u00b2 +184a -1530=0.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\na\u00b2 -184a +1530=0.\n\nNow, solve for a:\n\na = [184 \u00b1 sqrt(184\u00b2 -4*1*1530)] /2.\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n184\u00b2=33856.\n\n4*1*1530=6120.\n\nSo sqrt(33856 -6120)=sqrt(27736)= same as before, which is approximately 166.54, but let's see if it's a perfect square.",

Let's solve this for g:\n\n-2ga = -a\u00b2 -17 => g = (a\u00b2 +17)/(2a).\n\nSimilarly, from point G's equation:\n\nb\u00b2 + 214b + 11466 + 2g*(107 + b) = 0.\n\nLet's substitute g here:\n\n2g*(107 + b) = 2*( (a\u00b2 +17)/(2a) )*(107 + b) = ( (a\u00b2 +17)/(a) )*(107 + b).\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nb\u00b2 + 214b + 11466 + ( (a\u00b2 +17)*(107 + b) ) / a = 0.\n\nHmm, this looks complicated, but perhaps we can find another relation between a and b.\n\nEarlier, we had from EF = 184: a + 107 + b = 184 => a + b = 77.\n\nSo a + b = 77. Let me note this as equation (1): a + b = 77.\n\nSo perhaps we can express b in terms of a: b = 77 - a.\n\nThen, let's substitute b = 77 - a into the equation from point G.\n\nSo, b = 77 - a.\n\nPlugging into the equation:\n\nb\u00b2 + 214b + 11466 + ( (a\u00b2 +17)*(107 + b) ) / a = 0.\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst, b = 77 - a.\n\nSo b\u00b2 = (77 - a)^2 = 5929 - 154a + a\u00b2.\n\n214b = 214*(77 - a) = 214*77 - 214a.\n\n214*77: Let me compute that. 200*77=15,400; 14*77=1,078.

Equation (1): e\u00b2 +2g e +561=0.\n\nPlug in point G(e+184,-17):\n\n(e+184)^2 + (-17)^2 +2g(e+184) -16*(-17)=0.\n\nCompute:\n\n(e\u00b2 + 368e + 33856) + 289 + 2g e + 368 g +272=0.\n\nCombine terms:\n\ne\u00b2 + 368e + 33856 + 289 + 2g e + 368g +272=0.\n\nSimplify constants: 33856 +289=34145; 34145 +272=34417.\n\nSo, e\u00b2 +368e +2g e +34417 +368g=0.\n\nWhich is equation (2): e\u00b2 + (368 + 2g)e +34417 +368g=0.\n\nSubtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n\n[e\u00b2 + (368 + 2g)e +34417 +368g] - [e\u00b2 +2g e +561]=0.\n\nSimplify:\n\ne\u00b2 - e\u00b2 + (368 +2g -2g)e + (34417 +368g -561)=0.\n\nSo,\n\n368e + (33856 +368g)=0.\n\nFactor out 368: 368(e + g + 92)=0.\n\nSo, e + g +92=0 => e +g= -92. Equation (3).\n\nFrom equation (1): e\u00b2 +2g e +561=0.\n\nExpress g from equation (3): g= -92 -e.\n\nSubstitute into equation (1):\n\ne\u00b2 + 2*(-92 -e)e +561=0.\n\nCompute:\n\ne\u00b2 -184 e -2e\u00b2 +561=0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n- e\u00b2 -184 e +561=0.\n\nMultiply by -1:\n\ne\u00b2 +184 e -561=0.\n\nNow, solve for e using quadratic formula:\n\ne = [ -184 \u00b1 sqrt(184\u00b2 +4*561) ] /2.\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n184\u00b2 =33856.\n\n4*561=2244.\n\nSo, sqrt(33856 +2244)=sqrt(36100).\n\nsqrt(36100)=190.\n\nSo, e = [ -184 \u00b1 190 ] /2.\n\nTwo solutions:\n\n1. e = (-184 +190)/2 =6/2=3.\n\n2. e = (-184 -190)/2= (-374)/2= -187.\n\nAgain, e must be between 0 and107, so e=3.\n\nSo, e=3.\n\nSo, point E is at (3,0), and point F is at (3+184,0)= (187,0).\n\nNow, points H and G:\n\nSince the rectangle is below the x-axis, point H is at (e, -17)=(3,-17), and point G is at (e+184, -17)=(187,-17).\n\nNow, check if points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(3,-17), G(187,-17) lie on the same circle.\n\nUsing the circle equation we found earlier:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +2gx -16y=0.\n\nWith e=3, from equation (3): e +g= -92 => 3 +g= -92 => g= -95.\n\nSo, equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -190x -16y=0.\n\nNow, let's check point H(3,-17):\n\n3\u00b2 + (-17)^2 -190*3 -16*(-17)= 9 + 289 -570 +272.\n\nCompute: 9+289=298; 298 -570= -272; -272 +272=0. Correct.\n\nPoint G(187,-17):\n\n187\u00b2 + (-17)^2 -190*187 -16*(-17).\n\nCompute:\n\n187\u00b2=34969.\n\n(-17)^2=289.\n\n-190*187= Let's compute 190*187. 200*187=37,400. Subtract 10*187=1,870. So, 37,400 -1,870=35,530. So, -190*187= -35,530.\n\n-16*(-17)=272.\n\nSo, sum: 34969 +289 -35,530 +272.\n\nCompute:\n\n34969 +289=35,258.\n\n35,258 -35,530= -272.\n\n-272 +272=0. Correct.\n\nSo, the setup works.\n\nTherefore, e=3.\n\nNow, the length CE is the distance from point C to point E.\n\nPoint C is at (107,0), point E is at (3,0).\n\nSo, CE=107 -3=104.",

Let me note this as equation (1): a + b = 77.\n\nSo perhaps we can express b in terms of a: b = 77 - a.\n\nThen, let's substitute b = 77 - a into the equation from point G.\n\nSo, b = 77 - a.\n\nPlugging into the equation:\n\nb\u00b2 + 214b + 11466 + ( (a\u00b2 +17)*(107 + b) ) / a = 0.\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst, b = 77 - a.\n\nSo b\u00b2 = (77 - a)^2 = 5929 - 154a + a\u00b2.\n\n214b = 214*(77 - a) = 214*77 - 214a.\n\n214*77: Let me compute that. 200*77=15,400; 14*77=1,078. So total is 15,400 + 1,078 = 16,478. So 214b = 16,478 - 214a.\n\n11466 remains as is.\n\nNow, the term (a\u00b2 +17)*(107 + b) / a.\n\nFirst, compute 107 + b = 107 + (77 - a) = 184 - a.\n\nSo (a\u00b2 +17)*(184 - a) / a.\n\nLet me expand (a\u00b2 +17)*(184 - a):\n\n= a\u00b2*(184 - a) +17*(184 - a)\n= 184a\u00b2 - a\u00b3 + 3128 -17a.\n\nSo the entire term is (184a\u00b2 - a\u00b3 + 3128 -17a) / a.\n\nDivide each term by a:\n\n= 184a - a\u00b2 + 3128/a -17.\n\nSo putting it all together, the entire equation becomes:\n\n[5929 -154a + a\u00b2] + [16,478 -214a] + 11,466 + [184a - a\u00b2 + 3128/a -17] = 0.\n\nLet me combine like terms.\n\nFirst, let's write all terms out:\n\n5929 -154a + a\u00b2 +16,478 -214a +11,466 +184a -a\u00b2 +3128/a -17 = 0.\n\nNow, group similar terms:\n\na\u00b2 - a\u00b2 = 0.\n\n-154a -214a +184a = (-154 -214 +184)a = (-368 +184)a = (-184a).\n\nConstants: 5929 +16,478 +11,466 -17 = let's compute each step.\n\n5929 +16,478 = 22,407.\n\n22,407 +11,466 = 33,873.\n\n33,873 -17 = 33,856.\n\nThen, the term with 1/a: +3128/a.\n\nSo the equation simplifies to:\n\n-184a + 33,856 + 3128/a = 0.\n\nMultiply both sides by a to eliminate the denominator:\n\n-184a\u00b2 + 33,856a + 3128 = 0.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n184a\u00b2 - 33,856a -3128 = 0.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in a.

Let me calculate step by step: 180\u00b2=32400, 4\u00b2=16, so (180+4)^2 = 180\u00b2 + 2*180*4 +4\u00b2 = 32400 + 1440 +16 = 33856.\n\nSo, (h+184)^2 = h\u00b2 + 368h + 33856.\n\n33\u00b2=1089.\n\n2g*(h+184) = 2gh + 368g.\n\n-16*33 = -528.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nh\u00b2 + 368h + 33856 + 1089 + 2gh + 368g -528 = 0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nh\u00b2 + (368h + 2gh) + (33856 + 1089 -528) + 368g = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\nh\u00b2 + h*(368 + 2g) + (33856 + 1089 = 34945; 34945 -528=34417) + 368g = 0.\n\nSo, equation (2): h\u00b2 + (368 + 2g)h + 34417 + 368g = 0.\n\nNow, from equation (1): h\u00b2 + 2gh + 561 = 0.\n\nI can subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate h\u00b2.\n\nEquation (2) - equation (1):\n\n[h\u00b2 + (368 + 2g)h + 34417 + 368g] - [h\u00b2 + 2gh + 561] = 0 - 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\nh\u00b2 - h\u00b2 + (368 + 2g)h - 2gh + 34417 + 368g -561 = 0.\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n368h + (34417 - 561) + 368g = 0.\n\nCompute 34417 - 561: 34417 - 500=33917; 33917 -61=33856.\n\nSo:\n\n368h + 33856 + 368g = 0.\n\nFactor 368:\n\n368*(h + g) + 33856 = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by 368:\n\nh + g + (33856 / 368) = 0.\n\nCompute 33856 \u00f7 368.\n\nLet me compute 368 * 92 = ?\n\n368 * 90 = 33120.\n\n368 * 2 = 736.\n\nSo, 92: 33120 + 736 = 33856. Perfect.\n\nSo, 33856 / 368 = 92.\n\nSo, h + g + 92 = 0 \u21d2 h + g = -92.\n\nSo, equation (3): h + g = -92 \u21d2 g = -92 - h.\n\nNow, substitute g into equation (1):\n\nh\u00b2 + 2g h + 561 = 0.\n\ng = -92 - h, so:\n\nh\u00b2 + 2*(-92 - h)*h + 561 = 0.\n\nExpand:\n\nh\u00b2 - 184h - 2h\u00b2 + 561 = 0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nh\u00b2 - 2h\u00b2 = -h\u00b2.\n\nSo, -h\u00b2 -184h +561 = 0.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nh\u00b2 + 184h -561 = 0.\n\nNow, solve for h using quadratic formula:\n\nh = [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(184\u00b2 + 4*1*561)] / 2.\n\nCompute discriminant D:\n\n184\u00b2 = (180 +4)^2 = 180\u00b2 + 2*180*4 +4\u00b2 = 32400 + 1440 +16=33856.\n\n4*1*561=2244.\n\nSo, D = 33856 +2244=36100.\n\nsqrt(36100)=190.\n\nSo, h = [-184 \u00b1190]/2.\n\nSo, two possibilities:\n\n1) h = (-184 +190)/2 =6/2=3.\n\n2) h = (-184 -190)/2 = (-374)/2= -187.\n\nSo, h=3 or h=-187.\n\nNow, let's check each case.\n\nCase 1: h=3.\n\nThen, from equation (3): g= -92 -3= -95.\n\nSo, g=-95, f=-8, c=0.\n\nSo, the circle equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2*(-95)x + 2*(-8)y =0 \u21d2 x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -190x -16y =0.\n\nNow, let's see if point G, which is (h+184,33) = (3+184,33) = (187,33), lies on this circle.\n\nSubstitute x=187, y=33.\n\nCompute 187\u00b2 +33\u00b2 -190*187 -16*33.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n187\u00b2: Let me compute 180\u00b2=32400, 7\u00b2=49, and 2*180*7=2520. So, (180+7)^2=32400+2520+49=34969.\n\n33\u00b2=1089.\n\n190*187: Let's compute 200*187=37400, subtract 10*187=1870 \u2192 37400-1870=35530.\n\n16*33=528.\n\nSo, total: 34969 + 1089 -35530 -528.\n\nCompute 34969 +1089=36058.\n\n35530 +528=36058.\n\nSo, 36058 -36058=0.\n\nSo, yes, point G lies on the circle. So, h=3 is a valid solution.\n\nCase 2: h= -187.\n\nThen, g= -92 - (-187)= -92 +187=95.\n\nSo, g=95, f=-8.\n\nSo, circle equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2*95x -16y =0 \u21d2 x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +190x -16y=0.\n\nNow, check if point G is at (h+184,33)= (-187+184,33)= (-3,33).\n\nSubstitute x=-3, y=33.\n\nCompute (-3)^2 +33^2 +190*(-3) -16*33.\n\n=9 + 1089 + (-570) -528.\n\nCompute 9+1089=1098.\n\n-570 -528= -1098.\n\nSo, 1098 -1098=0.\n\nSo, yes, point G lies on the circle as well.\n\nSo, both h=3 and h=-187 are possible.\n\nNow, let's consider rectangle EFGH for each case.\n\nCase 1: h=3.\n\nSo, E is at (3,16), F at (3+184=187,16), G at (187,33), H at (3,33).\n\nCase 2: h=-187.\n\nE is at (-187,16), F at (-187+184= -3,16), G at (-3,33), H at (-187,33).",

Since D(0,0) is on the circle, plugging into the equation: 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + c = 0, so c=0.\n\nSo the equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx + 2fy = 0.\n\nNow, plug in point A(0,107): 0 + 107\u00b2 + 0 + 2f*107 = 0.\n\n107\u00b2 + 214f = 0 \u2192 214f = -107\u00b2 \u2192 f = -(107\u00b2)/(214) = -(107)/2 = -53.5.\n\nSo f = -53.5.\n\nNow, plug in point H(x,17): x\u00b2 + 17\u00b2 + 2g x + 2*(-53.5)*17 = 0.\n\nCompute 2*(-53.5)*17: that's -107*17 = -1819.\n\nSo equation: x\u00b2 + 289 + 2gx - 1819 = 0 \u2192 x\u00b2 + 2gx - 1530 = 0.\n\nSimilarly, plug in point G(x + 184,17):\n\n(x + 184)\u00b2 + 17\u00b2 + 2g(x + 184) + 2*(-53.5)*17 = 0.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n(x + 184)^2 = x\u00b2 + 368x + 184\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 368x + 33856.\n\n17\u00b2 = 289.\n\n2g(x + 184) = 2gx + 368g.\n\n2*(-53.5)*17 = same as before, which is -1819.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nx\u00b2 + 368x + 33856 + 289 + 2gx + 368g - 1819 = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b2 + (368x + 2gx) + (33856 + 289 - 1819) + 368g = 0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx\u00b2 + x(368 + 2g) + (33856 + 289 - 1819) + 368g = 0.\n\nCalculate the constants: 33856 + 289 = 34145; 34145 - 1819 = 32326.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 + x(368 + 2g) + 32326 + 368g = 0.\n\nBut from point H, we had x\u00b2 + 2gx - 1530 = 0.\n\nSo, let's write both equations:\n\n1. From H: x\u00b2 + 2gx - 1530 = 0.\n\n2. From G: x\u00b2 + (368 + 2g)x + 32326 + 368g = 0.\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(x\u00b2 + (368 + 2g)x + 32326 + 368g) - (x\u00b2 + 2gx -1530) = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b2 - x\u00b2 + (368 + 2g - 2g)x + (32326 + 368g + 1530) = 0.\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n368x + 33856 + 368g = 0.",

So, f = e + 184.\n\nGiven that, F is at (e + 184, 0).\n\nNow, the rectangle EFGH has EF = 184 and FG =17. Since EF is on the x-axis, FG must be vertical from F. But the direction depends on how the rectangle is placed. So, from F, moving up or down 17 units to reach G or H.",
