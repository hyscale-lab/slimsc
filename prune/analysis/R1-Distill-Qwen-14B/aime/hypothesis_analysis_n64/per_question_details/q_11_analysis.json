Let me compute this value using a calculator.\n\nBut since I don't have a calculator, I can approximate it.\n\nI know that tan(57\u00b0) \u2248 1.5399, tan(57.5\u00b0) \u2248 1.572, as I thought earlier. So 1.56 is between 57\u00b0 and 57.5\u00b0. Let's compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me use linear approximation between 57\u00b0 and 57.5\u00b0. The tan at 57\u00b0 is about 1.5399, at 57.5\u00b0 is about 1.572. The desired tan is 1.56.\n\nDifference between 57.5\u00b0 and 57\u00b0 is 0.5\u00b0, which corresponds to tan increasing by about 1.572 - 1.5399 = 0.0321.\n\nWe need tan \u03b8 = 1.56, which is 1.56 - 1.5399 = 0.0201 above 57\u00b0. So, fractionally, 0.0201 / 0.0321 \u2248 0.626. So \u03b8 \u2248 57\u00b0 + 0.626*(0.5\u00b0) \u2248 57\u00b0 + 0.313\u00b0 \u2248 57.313\u00b0. So approximately 57.3\u00b0.\n\nConverting 57.3\u00b0 to radians: 57.3\u00b0 \u2248 \u03c0/3 \u2248 1.047 radians, but wait, \u03c0 radians is 180\u00b0, so 57.3\u00b0 is \u03c0/3.1416 * 57.3 \u2248 1 radian. So 57.3\u00b0 is about 1 radian. So \u03b1 \u2248 1 radian.",

Let me write that out:\n\nE = (300 + 468i)e^{i\u03b8} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nNow, I can expand each term using Euler's formula: e^{i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8, and e^{-i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8.\n\nMultiplying out:\n\nFirst term: (300 + 468i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8)\n= 300 cos\u03b8 + 300i sin\u03b8 + 468i cos\u03b8 + 468i^2 sin\u03b8\n= 300 cos\u03b8 + 300i sin\u03b8 + 468i cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8\nBecause i^2 = -1.\n\nSo grouping real and imaginary parts:\nReal part: 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8\nImaginary part: 300 sin\u03b8 + 468 cos\u03b8\n\nSecond term: (24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8)\n= 24 cos\u03b8 - 24i sin\u03b8 + 36i cos\u03b8 - 36i^2 sin\u03b8\n= 24 cos\u03b8 - 24i sin\u03b8 + 36i cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\nAgain, i^2 = -1.\n\nGrouping real and imaginary parts:\nReal part: 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\nImaginary part: -24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8\n\nNow, adding the two terms together to get E:\n\nReal part of E: [300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8] + [24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8]\n= (300 + 24) cos\u03b8 + (-468 + 36) sin\u03b8\n= 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8\n\nImaginary part of E: [300 sin\u03b8 + 468 cos\u03b8] + [-24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8]\n= (300 - 24) sin\u03b8 + (468 + 36) cos\u03b8\n= 276 sin\u03b8 + 504 cos\u03b8\n\nBut since we are only interested in the real part of E, which is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. So our goal is to maximize this expression: Re(E) = 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nHmm, okay. So the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nI remember that expressions of the form A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 can be rewritten as C cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where C = sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2) and tan\u03c6 = B/A.

So, multiplying this out:\n\n(300 + 468i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8) = 300 cos\u03b8 + 300i sin\u03b8 + 468i cos\u03b8 + 468i^2 sin\u03b8.\n\nSince i^2 is -1, this becomes:\n\n300 cos\u03b8 + 300i sin\u03b8 + 468i cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8.\n\nNow, collecting the real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal part: 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8.\n\nImaginary part: (300 sin\u03b8 + 468 cos\u03b8) i.\n\nSimilarly, for the second term: (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\ne^{-i\u03b8} is cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8. So, multiplying:\n\n(24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8).\n\nExpanding this:\n\n24 cos\u03b8 - 24 i sin\u03b8 + 36i cos\u03b8 - 36i^2 sin\u03b8.\n\nAgain, i^2 is -1, so:\n\n24 cos\u03b8 - 24i sin\u03b8 + 36i cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8.\n\nCollecting real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal part: 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8.\n\nImaginary part: (-24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8) i.\n\nNow, adding the two real parts together:\n\n[300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8] + [24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8].\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n(300 + 24) cos\u03b8 + (-468 + 36) sin\u03b8.\n\nWhich is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, the real part of the entire expression is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. Hmm, okay.\n\nNow, I need to find the maximum value of this real part as \u03b8 varies. So, I need to maximize the expression 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nHmm, I remember that expressions of the form A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 can be rewritten as C cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where C is the amplitude and \u03c6 is the phase shift. The maximum value is then C.\n\nSo, let's write 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8 as R cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where R is the amplitude.",

Let me compute sqrt(309,024).\n\nWell, 556\u00b2 = 309,136, as I thought earlier. So 556\u00b2 = 309,136, so sqrt(309,024) is 556 - (309,136 - 309,024)/(2*556) approximately, using linear approximation.\n\nThe difference is 309,136 - 309,024 = 112.\n\nSo, sqrt(309,024) \u2248 556 - 112/(2*556) = 556 - 112/1112 \u2248 556 - 0.1007 \u2248 555.8993. So approximately 555.9.\n\nSimilarly, |B| is sqrt(24\u00b2 + 36\u00b2) = sqrt(576 + 1296) = sqrt(1872). As I computed earlier, that's approximately 43.26.\n\nNow, \u03b1 is arctan(468/300) = arctan(1.56). Let me compute this in radians because when computing sine and cosine, it's better to have radians.\n\nBut maybe I can just compute the sine and cosine of \u03b1 and \u03b2 numerically.\n\nCompute \u03b1:\n\ntan \u03b1 = 468/300 = 1.56.\n\nSo, \u03b1 = arctan(1.56). Let me compute this value using a calculator.\n\nBut since I don't have a calculator, I can approximate it.\n\nI know that tan(57\u00b0) \u2248 1.5399, tan(57.5\u00b0) \u2248 1.572, as I thought earlier. So 1.56 is between 57\u00b0 and 57.5\u00b0. Let's compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me use linear approximation between 57\u00b0 and 57.5\u00b0. The tan at 57\u00b0 is about 1.5399, at 57.5\u00b0 is about 1.572. The desired tan is 1.56.\n\nDifference between 57.5\u00b0 and 57\u00b0 is 0.5\u00b0, which corresponds to tan increasing by about 1.572 - 1.5399 = 0.0321.\n\nWe need tan \u03b8 = 1.56, which is 1.56 - 1.5399 = 0.0201 above 57\u00b0. So, fractionally, 0.0201 / 0.0321 \u2248 0.626. So \u03b8 \u2248 57\u00b0 + 0.626*(0.5\u00b0) \u2248 57\u00b0 + 0.313\u00b0 \u2248 57.313\u00b0.

Hmm, 54^2 is 2916 because 50^2=2500, 55^2=3025, so 54^2 is (55-1)^2 = 55^2 - 2*55 +1 = 3025 -110 +1=2916. So sqrt(2916)=54, so R=54*10=540.\n\nSo, \\( R = 540 \\). Therefore, the maximum value of \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\) is 540, because the maximum of \\( R\\cos(\\theta + \\phi) \\) is R.",

Then 324^2 = (300 +24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 +24^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000+14400 is 104400, plus 576 is 104,976.\n\nSimilarly, 432 squared. 400^2 is 160000, 32^2 is 1024.

The square root of that is sqrt(291600). Let me compute that.\n\nHmm, 540^2 is 291,600 because 500^2 is 250,000, 40^2 is 1,600; but wait, 540*540: 500*500=250,000, 500*40=20,000, 40*500=20,000, 40*40=1,600. So adding 250,000 +20,000 +20,000 +1,600 = 291,600. So sqrt(291600) is 540.\n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is 540.",

Let me substitute these into the expression.\n\nFirst term: (300 + 468i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8)\nSecond term: (24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8)\n\nLet's compute each term.\n\nStarting with the first term:\n(300 + 468i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8) = 300 cos\u03b8 + 300i sin\u03b8 + 468i cos\u03b8 + 468i\u00b2 sin\u03b8\nBut i\u00b2 is -1, so that becomes:\n300 cos\u03b8 + 300i sin\u03b8 + 468i cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8\n\nCombine like terms:\nReal parts: 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8\nImaginary parts: (300 sin\u03b8 + 468 cos\u03b8)i\n\nSo, first term is [300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8] + i[300 sin\u03b8 + 468 cos\u03b8]\n\nNow, the second term:\n(24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8) = 24 cos\u03b8 - 24i sin\u03b8 + 36i cos\u03b8 - 36i\u00b2 sin\u03b8\nAgain, i\u00b2 is -1, so that becomes:\n24 cos\u03b8 - 24i sin\u03b8 + 36i cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\n\nCombine like terms:\nReal parts: 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\nImaginary parts: (-24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8)i\n\nSo, second term is [24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8] + i[-24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8]\n\nNow, adding both terms together, the entire expression is:\n\n[ (300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8) + (24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8) ] + i[ (300 sin\u03b8 + 468 cos\u03b8) + (-24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8) ]\n\nLet me compute the real and imaginary parts separately.\n\nReal part:\n300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8 + 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\n= (300 + 24) cos\u03b8 + (-468 + 36) sin\u03b8\n= 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8\n\nImaginary part:\n300 sin\u03b8 + 468 cos\u03b8 -24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8\n= (300 -24) sin\u03b8 + (468 + 36) cos\u03b8\n= 276 sin\u03b8 + 504 cos\u03b8\n\nSo, the entire expression is:\n(324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8) + i(276 sin\u03b8 + 504 cos\u03b8)\n\nWe are interested in the real part of this expression, which is Re = 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of Re = 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nHmm, that seems more manageable. So, I need to find the maximum of Re as \u03b8 varies.\n\nI remember that expressions of the form A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 have a maximum value of sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2).",

So, the maximum real part is 540. Therefore, the answer should be 540.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think if there's another approach. Maybe using vectors or something else.",

So, the first term is \\( (300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta} \\).\n\nSimilarly, the second term: \\( 6*(4 + 6i)e^{-i\\theta} \\). Let me compute 6*(4+6i) first. 6*4 is 24, 6*6 is 36. So, that's 24 + 36i. So, the second term is \\( (24 + 36i) e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nSo, the entire expression is \\( (300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nNow, I need to find the real part of this expression.

Let me substitute these into the expression.\n\nFirst term: (300 + 468i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8)\nSecond term: (24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8)\n\nLet's compute each term.\n\nStarting with the first term:\n(300 + 468i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8) = 300 cos\u03b8 + 300i sin\u03b8 + 468i cos\u03b8 + 468i\u00b2 sin\u03b8\nBut i\u00b2 is -1, so that becomes:\n300 cos\u03b8 + 300i sin\u03b8 + 468i cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8\n\nCombine like terms:\nReal parts: 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8\nImaginary parts: (300 sin\u03b8 + 468 cos\u03b8)i\n\nSo, first term is [300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8] + i[300 sin\u03b8 + 468 cos\u03b8]\n\nNow, the second term:\n(24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8) = 24 cos\u03b8 - 24i sin\u03b8 + 36i cos\u03b8 - 36i\u00b2 sin\u03b8\nAgain, i\u00b2 is -1, so that becomes:\n24 cos\u03b8 - 24i sin\u03b8 + 36i cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\n\nCombine like terms:\nReal parts: 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\nImaginary parts: (-24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8)i\n\nSo, second term is [24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8] + i[-24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8]\n\nNow, adding both terms together, the entire expression is:\n\n[ (300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8) + (24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8) ] + i[ (300 sin\u03b8 + 468 cos\u03b8) + (-24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8) ]\n\nLet me compute the real and imaginary parts separately.\n\nReal part:\n300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8 + 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\n= (300 + 24) cos\u03b8 + (-468 + 36) sin\u03b8\n= 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8\n\nImaginary part:\n300 sin\u03b8 + 468 cos\u03b8 -24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8\n= (300 -24) sin\u03b8 + (468 + 36) cos\u03b8\n= 276 sin\u03b8 + 504 cos\u03b8\n\nSo, the entire expression is:\n(324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8) + i(276 sin\u03b8 + 504 cos\u03b8)\n\nWe are interested in the real part of this expression, which is Re = 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of Re = 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nHmm, that seems more manageable. So, I need to find the maximum of Re as \u03b8 varies.\n\nI remember that expressions of the form A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 have a maximum value of sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2).",
