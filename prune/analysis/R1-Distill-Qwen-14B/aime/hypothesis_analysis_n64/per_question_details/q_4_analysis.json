So we're looking for n where the current player (Alice) cannot force a win, meaning Bob can.\n\nSo the task is to find all n \u2264 2024 where the starting player (Alice) is in a losing position. The count of such n is the answer.\n\nHow to approach this? I think we can model this using dynamic programming or by finding a pattern in the losing positions.\n\nLet me try to list out the positions and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nStarting from n=0.

So since at least one move leads to a losing position, f(4)=true\nn=5: can take 1 to n=4 (true) or 4 to n=1 (true). Both moves lead to opponent being able to win, so f(5)=false\nn=6: take 1 to n=5 (false) \u2192 so f(6)=true\nn=7: take 1 to n=6 (true) or 4 to n=3 (true).

Since taking 4 leads to opponent losing, f(9)=true\nn=10: take 1 to n=9 (true) or 4 to n=6 (true). Both moves lead to opponent winning, so f(10)=false\nn=11: take 1 to n=10 (false) \u2192 f(11)=true\nn=12: take 1 to n=11 (true) or 4 to n=8 (true).

So f(14)=true\nn=15: take 1 to n=14 (true) or 4 to n=11 (true). Both moves lead to opponent winning, so f(15)=false\n\nSo the losing positions (f(n)=false) are at n=2,5,7,10,12,15.\n\nSo up to n=15, the losing positions are 6 numbers. So the pattern is every 5 numbers, starting from n=2, the losing positions are n=2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22, etc.\n\nLooking at these numbers, they can be expressed as:\n\nn=5k +2 for k\u22650: 2,7,12,17,22,...\nn=5k +0 for k\u22651:5,10,15,20,25,...\n\nSo the losing positions are n\u22610 mod5 (n\u22655) and n\u22612 mod5 (n\u22652).\n\nSo the total number of losing positions up to n=2024 is the count of numbers \u22610 mod5 (starting from 5) plus the count of numbers \u22612 mod5 (starting from 2).\n\nNow, let's compute how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5 and \u22655, and how many are \u22612 mod5 and \u22652.\n\nNumbers \u22610 mod5: The first such number is 5, then 10, 15,... up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nThe maximum multiple of5 \u22642024 is 2020, since 2020=5*404.

So, the current position is losing.\n\nTherefore, f(n) is true if either f(n-1) or f(n-4) is false, i.e., if the current player can move to a losing position for the opponent.\n\nSo, f(n) = (not f(n-1)) OR (not f(n-4))\n\nBut since it's an OR, if either of those is true, then f(n) is true.\n\nSo, let me try to compute f(n) for small n and see if a pattern emerges.\n\nn=0: f(0)=false (losing position)\nn=1: can take 1 token, leading to n=0, which is losing for the opponent.

Since n=2<4, only option is taking 1. Since f(1) is true, not f(1) is false. So f(2)=false. So, n=2 is a losing position.\nn=3: similar logic.

So, if the player takes 4, opponent is at n=0, which is losing. So f(4)=true (winning)\nn=5: can take 1 to n=4 (f(4)=true), or 4 to n=1 (f(1)=true).

So, dp[20]=False, which is correct.\n\nSo, the pattern holds.\n\nSo, the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, to find the numbers n \u22642024 where Bob can force a win, these are the numbers where n is a losing position for Alice (since Bob is the second player). So, n must be \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, the task is to find the number of integers \u22642024 that are \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, for each modulus, 0 and 2, count how many numbers \u22642024 satisfy n \u22610 mod5 and n\u22612 mod5.\n\nTotal count is (number of n \u22642024 with n\u22610 mod5) + (number of n \u22642024 with n\u22612 mod5).\n\nSo, let's compute for each residue.\n\nFor residue 0 mod5:\n\nThe numbers are 0,5,10,..., up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nThe maximum multiple of 5 \u22642024 is 2020, since 2020=5\u00d7404.\n\nSo, the numbers are 0,5,10,...,2020.\n\nNumber of terms: (2020 -0)/5 +1 = 404 +1=405.",

So since at least one move leads to a losing position, f(4)=true\nn=5: can take 1 to n=4 (true) or 4 to n=1 (true).

So f(14)=true\nn=15: take 1 to n=14 (true) or 4 to n=11 (true). Both moves lead to opponent winning, so f(15)=false\n\nSo the losing positions (f(n)=false) are at n=2,5,7,10,12,15.\n\nSo up to n=15, the losing positions are 6 numbers. So the pattern is every 5 numbers, starting from n=2, the losing positions are n=2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22, etc.\n\nLooking at these numbers, they can be expressed as:\n\nn=5k +2 for k\u22650: 2,7,12,17,22,...\nn=5k +0 for k\u22651:5,10,15,20,25,...\n\nSo the losing positions are n\u22610 mod5 (n\u22655) and n\u22612 mod5 (n\u22652).\n\nSo the total number of losing positions up to n=2024 is the count of numbers \u22610 mod5 (starting from 5) plus the count of numbers \u22612 mod5 (starting from 2).\n\nNow, let's compute how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5 and \u22655, and how many are \u22612 mod5 and \u22652.\n\nNumbers \u22610 mod5: The first such number is 5, then 10, 15,... up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nThe maximum multiple of5 \u22642024 is 2020, since 2020=5*404.

So, the current position is losing.\n\nTherefore, f(n) is true if either f(n-1) or f(n-4) is false, i.e., if the current player can move to a losing position for the opponent.\n\nSo, f(n) = (not f(n-1)) OR (not f(n-4))\n\nBut since it's an OR, if either of those is true, then f(n) is true.\n\nSo, let me try to compute f(n) for small n and see if a pattern emerges.\n\nn=0: f(0)=false (losing position)\nn=1: can take 1 token, leading to n=0, which is losing for the opponent.

Since n=2<4, only option is taking 1. Since f(1) is true, not f(1) is false. So f(2)=false. So, n=2 is a losing position.\nn=3: similar logic.

So, if the player takes 4, opponent is at n=0, which is losing. So f(4)=true (winning)\nn=5: can take 1 to n=4 (f(4)=true), or 4 to n=1 (f(1)=true). Both moves lead the opponent to a winning position. So, f(5)=false (losing)\nn=6: take 1 to n=5 (f(5)=false), so opponent is in losing position.

So n=5 is L.\nn=6: Current player can take 1, leaving n=5 (L for opponent). So opponent is in L, so current player can win. So n=6 is W.\nn=7: Current player can take 1, leaving n=6 (W for opponent).

Let's check n=17.\n\nn=17: I can take 1, leaving n=16 (W), or take 4, leaving n=13 (W). So all moves lead to opponent in W. So n=17 is L.

Let me think about how the game progresses.\n\nLet me denote a position as \"winning\" (W) if the current player can force a win, and \"losing\" (L) if the current player cannot force a win, regardless of what the opponent does.\n\nThe base case is when there are no tokens left.",

Since n=2<4, only option is taking 1. Since f(1) is true, not f(1) is false. So f(2)=false. So, n=2 is a losing position.\nn=3: similar logic. Can take 1, leading to n=2 (f(2)=false), so the opponent is in a losing position. So, f(3)=true (winning)\nn=4: can take 1 leading to n=3 (f(3)=true), or take 4 leading to n=0 (f(0)=false). So, if the player takes 4, opponent is at n=0, which is losing. So f(4)=true (winning)\nn=5: can take 1 to n=4 (f(4)=true), or 4 to n=1 (f(1)=true). Both moves lead the opponent to a winning position. So, f(5)=false (losing)\nn=6: take 1 to n=5 (f(5)=false), so opponent is in losing position. So f(6)=true.\nn=7: take 1 to n=6 (f(6)=true), or take 4 to n=3 (f(3)=true). Both moves lead to opponent's winning, so f(7)=false.\nn=8: take 1 to n=7 (f(7)=false) or 4 to n=4 (f(4)=true). So, if the player takes 1, opponent is in losing position. So f(8)=true.\nn=9: take 1 to n=8 (f(8)=true) or 4 to n=5 (f(5)=false). So, taking 4 leads to opponent's losing, so f(9)=true.",

All moves lead to W, so n=5 is L.\n\nn=6: Take 1 to reach n=5 (L). So n=6 is W.\n\nn=7: Take 1 to reach n=6 (W), or take 4 to reach n=3 (W). So all moves lead to W, so n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: Take 1 to reach n=7 (L). So n=8 is W.\n\nn=9: Take 1 to reach n=8 (W), or take 4 to reach n=5 (L). Since taking 4 leads to L, n=9 is W.\n\nn=10: Take 1 to reach n=9 (W), or take 4 to reach n=6 (W). All moves lead to W, so n=10 is L.\n\nn=11: Take 1 to reach n=10 (L). So n=11 is W.\n\nn=12: Take 1 to reach n=11 (W), or take 4 to reach n=8 (W). So all moves lead to W, so n=12 is L.\n\nn=13: Take 1 to reach n=12 (L). So n=13 is W.\n\nn=14: Take 1 to reach n=13 (W), or take 4 to reach n=10 (L). So n=14 is W because you can take 4 to reach L.\n\nn=15: Take 1 to reach n=14 (W), or take 4 to reach n=11 (W). So all moves lead to W, so n=15 is L.\n\nHmm, so looking at the pattern:\n\nn | outcome\n0 | L\n1 | W\n2 | L\n3 | W\n4 | W\n5 | L\n6 | W\n7 | L\n8 | W\n9 | W\n10| L\n11| W\n12| L\n13| W\n14| W\n15| L\n16| W\n17| L\n18| W\n19| W\n20| L\n...\n\nLooking for a pattern here. Let's see the L positions: n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nThe differences between the L positions: 2,3,2,3,2,3,2,3,...\n\nSo it alternates between adding 2 and 3.\n\n0 +2=2, 2+3=5, 5+2=7, 7+3=10, 10+2=12, 12+3=15, 15+2=17, 17+3=20, etc.\n\nSo the L positions are numbers that are congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5?",
          "text2": "Wait, but wait. Let me re-express this. For each n, I need to see if all moves lead to a W position for the opponent. If all moves from n lead to the opponent having a W, then n is L. If any move leads to opponent having L, then n is W.\n\nSo more formally:\n\n- For any position n, if there exists a move (taking 1 or 4 tokens) leading to a position m where m is L, then n is W.\n- If all moves from n lead to m where m is W, then n is L.\n\nSo let's build this step by step.\n\nn=0: Well, that's an invalid position because there are no tokens. So it's not considered here.\n\nn=1:\n- Can take 1, leading to n=0. Since n=0 is not a valid position, taking 1 leads to the game ending, so the player can win. So n=1 is W.\n\nn=2:\n- Can take 1, leading to n=1 which is W. So from n=2, all moves lead to W. Therefore, n=2 is L.\n\nn=3:\n- Take 1, leading to n=2 which is L. So n=3 is W.\n\nn=4:\n- Take 4, leading to n=0, which is a win. So n=4 is W.\n\nn=5:\n- Take 1 \u2192 n=4 (W)\n- Take 4 \u2192 n=1 (W)\nSince all moves lead to W, n=5 is L.\n\nn=6:\n- Take 1 \u2192 n=5 (L). So n=6 is W, because taking 1 leads to opponent's L.\n\nn=7:\n- Take 1 \u2192 n=6 (W)\n- Take 4 \u2192 n=3 (W)\nAll moves lead to W, so n=7 is L.\n\nn=8:\n- Take 1 \u2192 n=7 (L). So n=8 is W.\n\nn=9:\n- Take 1 \u2192 n=8 (W)\n- Take 4 \u2192 n=5 (L)\nSo since taking 4 leads to L, n=9 is W.",

Both moves lead to opponent winning, so f(15)=false\n\nSo the losing positions (f(n)=false) are at n=2,5,7,10,12,15.\n\nSo up to n=15, the losing positions are 6 numbers. So the pattern is every 5 numbers, starting from n=2, the losing positions are n=2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22, etc.\n\nLooking at these numbers, they can be expressed as:\n\nn=5k +2 for k\u22650: 2,7,12,17,22,...\nn=5k +0 for k\u22651:5,10,15,20,25,...\n\nSo the losing positions are n\u22610 mod5 (n\u22655) and n\u22612 mod5 (n\u22652).\n\nSo the total number of losing positions up to n=2024 is the count of numbers \u22610 mod5 (starting from 5) plus the count of numbers \u22612 mod5 (starting from 2).\n\nNow, let's compute how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5 and \u22655, and how many are \u22612 mod5 and \u22652.\n\nNumbers \u22610 mod5: The first such number is 5, then 10, 15,... up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nThe maximum multiple of5 \u22642024 is 2020, since 2020=5*404.

Since n=2<4, only option is taking 1. Since f(1) is true, not f(1) is false. So f(2)=false. So, n=2 is a losing position.\nn=3: similar logic.

So, if the player takes 4, opponent is at n=0, which is losing. So f(4)=true (winning)\nn=5: can take 1 to n=4 (f(4)=true), or 4 to n=1 (f(1)=true).

If they take 1, the opponent is at n-1. If n-1 is a losing position for the opponent, meaning f(n-1) is False, then the current player can win by taking 1 token. Similarly for taking 4 tokens. So, if either of these options leads to the opponent being in a losing position, the current position is a winning one.\n\nTherefore, f(n) = not (f(n-1) and f(n-4)).",

So, if both are true, then no matter whether the current player takes 1 or 4 tokens, the opponent can force a win. So, the current position is losing.\n\nTherefore, f(n) is true if either f(n-1) or f(n-4) is false, i.e., if the current player can move to a losing position for the opponent.\n\nSo, f(n) = (not f(n-1)) OR (not f(n-4))\n\nBut since it's an OR, if either of those is true, then f(n) is true.\n\nSo, let me try to compute f(n) for small n and see if a pattern emerges.\n\nn=0: f(0)=false (losing position)\nn=1: can take 1 token, leading to n=0, which is losing for the opponent. So f(1)=true (winning)\nn=2: can take 1, leading to n=1, which is winning for opponent. Or take 4, which isn't possible. So n=2: f(2) = (not f(1)) OR (if n>=4, not f(n-4)). Since n=2<4, only option is taking 1. Since f(1) is true, not f(1) is false. So f(2)=false. So, n=2 is a losing position.\nn=3: similar logic.

So, if the player takes 4, opponent is at n=0, which is losing. So f(4)=true (winning)\nn=5: can take 1 to n=4 (f(4)=true), or 4 to n=1 (f(1)=true). Both moves lead the opponent to a winning position. So, f(5)=false (losing)\nn=6: take 1 to n=5 (f(5)=false), so opponent is in losing position. So f(6)=true.\nn=7: take 1 to n=6 (f(6)=true), or take 4 to n=3 (f(3)=true). Both moves lead to opponent's winning, so f(7)=false.\nn=8: take 1 to n=7 (f(7)=false) or 4 to n=4 (f(4)=true). So, if the player takes 1, opponent is in losing position. So f(8)=true.\nn=9: take 1 to n=8 (f(8)=true) or 4 to n=5 (f(5)=false). So, taking 4 leads to opponent's losing, so f(9)=true.",
