The complementary event of B is that Jen has fewer than two matches, i.e., zero or one matches. So, P(B) = 1 - P(zero matches) - P(exactly one match). Maybe that's simpler because the numbers might be easier to compute.\n\nLet me try that approach. So, I need to calculate the number of ways the lottery can be drawn such that Jen has zero or one matching numbers, and subtract that from the total to get the number of ways she has at least two matches.\n\nFirst, let's compute the number of ways to have zero matches. That is, none of Jen's four numbers are chosen, so all four numbers are from the remaining 6 numbers (since S has 10 numbers and Jen has 4, so 10-4=6). So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers all from the 6 non-Jen numbers is C(6,4).\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to have exactly one match: we choose 1 number from Jen's 4, and the remaining 3 numbers from the 6 non-Jen numbers. So, that's C(4,1) * C(6,3).\n\nLet me compute these.\n\nC(6,4) is 15. So, 15 ways for zero matches.\n\nC(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20, so 4*20=80 ways for exactly one match.\n\nSo, the total number of ways for zero or one matches is 15 + 80 = 95.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways for at least two matches is total ways (210) minus 95, which is 210 - 95 = 115. So, there are 115 favorable outcomes for event B.\n\nTherefore, P(B) is 115/210. Let me simplify that fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5: 115 \u00f75=23, 210 \u00f75=42. So, 23/42. Hmm, wait, 23 is a prime number, so 23 and 42 share no common factors (since 42=2*3*7). So, 23/42 is the simplified form.",

The probability of not winning a prize is the probability of having less than two matches, i.e., 0 or 1 matches. So P(prize) = 1 - P(0) - P(1).\n\nLet me think if that might be easier. Let's see.\n\nSo first, P(0): the probability that none of her numbers are chosen. The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from S without any of Jen's 4 numbers is C(6,4), since there are 10-4=6 numbers not chosen by Jen. So the number of favorable outcomes is C(6,4). Therefore, P(0) = C(6,4) / C(10,4).\n\nSimilarly, P(1): the probability that exactly one of her numbers is chosen. The number of ways to choose 1 number from Jen's 4 and 3 numbers from the remaining 6. So that's C(4,1)*C(6,3). So P(1) = [C(4,1)*C(6,3)] / C(10,4).\n\nSo let's compute these.\n\nFirst, C(6,4) is 15, because 6!/(4!2!) = (6*5)/(2*1) = 15.\n\nC(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20.

That is, none of her 4 numbers are chosen. So, the four numbers chosen are all from the remaining 6 numbers (since S has 10 numbers, and Jen has picked 4, leaving 6). The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 6 is C(6,4). So, C(6,4) is 15.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways she can have exactly 1 match is: choose 1 number from her 4, and 3 numbers from the remaining 6. So, that's C(4,1)*C(6,3). C(4,1) is 4, C(6,3) is 20.

The number of favorable outcomes for B is the number of ways the lottery can pick 4 numbers where exactly 2, 3, or 4 of them match Jen's 4 numbers.

So, to compute P(B), we need to find the number of ways where the lottery's 4-number selection overlaps with Jen's 4 numbers by 2, 3, or 4 numbers.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let\u2019s denote Jen's numbers as a set J, which has 4 elements. The lottery's numbers are a set L, which also has 4 elements. We want the number of possible L such that |J \u2229 L| \u2265 2.\n\nSo, the number of favorable cases is the sum of three terms: the number of L where |J \u2229 L| = 2, plus the number where |J \u2229 L| = 3, plus the number where |J \u2229 L| =4.\n\nSo, let's calculate each of these.\n\nFirst, compute the number of L where |J \u2229 L| = 2.\n\nTo choose 4 numbers where exactly 2 are from J (which has 4 elements) and 2 are from the remaining numbers not in J (which has 10 - 4 = 6 elements).\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 2 numbers from J is C(4,2), and the number of ways to choose the remaining 2 numbers from the 6 non-J numbers is C(6,2). Therefore, the number of such L is C(4,2) * C(6,2).\n\nSimilarly, for |J \u2229 L|=3: we choose 3 from J and 1 from the remaining 6. So, the number is C(4,3)*C(6,1).\n\nFor |J \u2229 L|=4: all 4 numbers are chosen from J. So, the number is C(4,4) = 1.\n\nTherefore, the total number of favorable L for event B is:\n\nC(4,2)*C(6,2) + C(4,3)*C(6,1) + C(4,4)*C(6,0).\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nC(4,2) = 6.\n\nC(6,2) = 15.\n\nSo, 6 * 15 = 90.\n\nC(4,3) = 4.\n\nC(6,1) = 6.\n\nSo, 4 * 6 = 24.\n\nC(4,4) = 1.\n\nC(6,0) = 1.\n\nSo, 1 * 1 = 1.\n\nAdding these up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable L for event B is 115.

So, 1*1 = 1.\n\nAdding these up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes for B is 115, and the total possible outcomes is C(10,4) which is 210.\n\nTherefore, P(B) = 115 / 210.\n\nSimplify that? Let's see, 115 and 210 are both divisible by 5. 115 \u00f75=23, 210 \u00f75=42. So, 23/42.\n\nNow, for event A, the number of favorable outcomes is 1, so P(A) = 1/210.",
          "text2": "Wait, but maybe it's better to compute it directly. Let me think. The number of favorable outcomes for B is the number of ways the lottery can pick 4 numbers where exactly 2, 3, or 4 of them match Jen's 4 numbers. So, we can break this into three cases: exactly 2 matches, exactly 3 matches, and exactly 4 matches.\n\nBut since we already know that when exactly 4 matches, that's the grand prize, which is part of B as well. So, to compute P(B), we need to find the number of ways where the lottery's 4-number selection overlaps with Jen's 4 numbers by 2, 3, or 4 numbers.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let\u2019s denote Jen's numbers as a set J, which has 4 elements. The lottery's numbers are a set L, which also has 4 elements. We want the number of possible L such that |J \u2229 L| \u2265 2.\n\nSo, the number of favorable cases is the sum of three terms: the number of L where |J \u2229 L| = 2, plus the number where |J \u2229 L| = 3, plus the number where |J \u2229 L| =4.\n\nSo, let's calculate each of these.\n\nFirst, compute the number of L where |J \u2229 L| = 2.\n\nTo choose 4 numbers where exactly 2 are from J (which has 4 elements) and 2 are from the remaining numbers not in J (which has 10 - 4 = 6 elements).\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 2 numbers from J is C(4,2), and the number of ways to choose the remaining 2 numbers from the 6 non-J numbers is C(6,2). Therefore, the number of such L is C(4,2) * C(6,2).\n\nSimilarly, for |J \u2229 L|=3: we choose 3 from J and 1 from the remaining 6. So, the number is C(4,3)*C(6,1).\n\nFor |J \u2229 L|=4: all 4 numbers are chosen from J. So, the number is C(4,4) = 1.\n\nTherefore, the total number of favorable L for event B is:\n\nC(4,2)*C(6,2) + C(4,3)*C(6,1) + C(4,4)*C(6,0).\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nC(4,2) = 6.\n\nC(6,2) = 15.\n\nSo, 6 * 15 = 90.\n\nC(4,3) = 4.\n\nC(6,1) = 6.\n\nSo, 4 * 6 = 24.\n\nC(4,4) = 1.\n\nC(6,0) = 1.\n\nSo, 1 * 1 = 1.\n\nAdding these up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable L for event B is 115. Since the total number of possible L is 210, P(B) is 115/210.",

So, I need to calculate the number of ways the lottery can be drawn such that Jen has zero or one matching numbers, and subtract that from the total to get the number of ways she has at least two matches.\n\nFirst, let's compute the number of ways to have zero matches. That is, none of Jen's four numbers are chosen, so all four numbers are from the remaining 6 numbers (since S has 10 numbers and Jen has 4, so 10-4=6). So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers all from the 6 non-Jen numbers is C(6,4).\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to have exactly one match: we choose 1 number from Jen's 4, and the remaining 3 numbers from the 6 non-Jen numbers.

Let's see.\n\nSo first, P(0): the probability that none of her numbers are chosen. The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from S without any of Jen's 4 numbers is C(6,4), since there are 10-4=6 numbers not chosen by Jen. So the number of favorable outcomes is C(6,4).

So P(1) = [C(4,1)*C(6,3)] / C(10,4).\n\nSo let's compute these.\n\nFirst, C(6,4) is 15, because 6!/(4!2!) = (6*5)/(2*1) = 15.\n\nC(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20.

The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 6 is C(6,4).

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of ways to get exactly 0 matches is 15, 1 match is 80, 2 matches is 90, 3 matches is 24, and 4 matches is 1.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to win a prize is the sum of the number of ways for k=2,3,4. So, 90 +24 +1=115.\n\nTherefore, P(B) = 115 / 210.\n\nSimplify that: both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5. 115 \u00f75=23, 210 \u00f75=42. So, 23/42.\n\nTherefore, P(B) =23/42.",

So, the probability of exactly k successes is [C(4, k) * C(10 - 4, 4 - k)] / C(10,4).\n\nYes, that's correct. So, for k=0, it's C(4,0)*C(6,4)/C(10,4). For k=1, it's C(4,1)*C(6,3)/C(10,4). Then, for k=2, it's C(4,2)*C(6,2)/C(10,4), and so on. But since we're using the approach where we subtract the probabilities for k=0 and k=1 from 1 to find P(B), let's compute these.\n\nFirst, compute P(k=0):\n\nC(4,0) is 1. C(6,4) is 15. So, 1*15 = 15. Divide by 210, so P(0) = 15/210 = 1/14.\n\nNext, P(k=1):\n\nC(4,1) is 4. C(6,3) is 20. So, 4*20 = 80. Divide by 210, so P(1) = 80/210 = 8/21.\n\nSo, P(no prize) = P(0) + P(1) = 1/14 + 8/21.

So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers all from the 6 non-Jen numbers is C(6,4).\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to have exactly one match: we choose 1 number from Jen's 4, and the remaining 3 numbers from the 6 non-Jen numbers.

Let's see.\n\nSo first, P(0): the probability that none of her numbers are chosen. The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from S without any of Jen's 4 numbers is C(6,4), since there are 10-4=6 numbers not chosen by Jen. So the number of favorable outcomes is C(6,4).

Let's see.\n\nSo first, P(0): the probability that none of her numbers are chosen.
