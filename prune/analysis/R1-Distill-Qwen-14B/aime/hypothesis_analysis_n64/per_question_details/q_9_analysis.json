So, now I can maybe substitute one into the other.\n\nLooking back at equation (1): x * A = 10 => x = 10 / A.\n\nEquation (2): 4y * B = 10.

Let me write them down:\n\nx = 10 / A,\ny = (5A)/2.\n\nBut I also know that from the definitions of A and B, we can relate x and y in another way.

Multiply both sides by 2x^{10/x} to get rid of the denominator on the right.\n\nSo, (x/10) * 2x^{10/x} = 5. Simplify the left side: 2x^{10/x} * x /10. Which is (2x^{10/x} * x)/10.

If I denote equation (A) as x * (ln y / ln x) = 10, and equation (B) as 4y * (ln x / ln y) = 10, then these two equations are related.\n\nNotice that (ln y / ln x) is the reciprocal of (ln x / ln y).

Then, the equation becomes:\n\n2 ln(5) = t [1 + 10/x]\n\nBut since x = e^t, I can substitute:\n\n2 ln(5) = t [1 + 10 / e^t ]\n\nHmm, this looks complicated. Maybe it's better to consider if x and y are equal. Let's suppose x = y, then from xy=25, x^2=25 \u2192 x=5, y=5. But when I check that, in the first equation, log_5(5^5) = 5, which isn't 10.
