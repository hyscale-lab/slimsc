The number of direction changes would be the number of times the path switches from right to up or up to right. So, if there are k segments, the number of direction changes is k-1. Because each new segment after the first is a direction change.\n\nSo, to have exactly four direction changes, the path must consist of five segments. Because 4 changes mean 5 segments.

So, every time the direction changes, the number of segments increases by one. Starting with one segment, after four changes, it's five segments. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nSo, if the path has five segments, each segment is a consecutive sequence of either right or up moves. Now, these segments must alternate between right and up. Because each time you change direction, you switch from right to up or up to right. So, if it starts with right, the sequence of segments would be right, up, right, up, etc. Or if it starts with up, it's up, right, up, right, etc.\n\nTherefore, for a path with exactly four direction changes, it must consist of five segments, each alternating between right and up.

These runs alternate between right and up.\n\nSo, let's model this as having five runs, each consisting of some number of steps. Each run must have at least one step because you can't have a run of zero steps. And since there are eight right steps and eight up steps in total, the sum of the right runs must be eight, and the sum of the up runs must also be eight.\n\nBut since the runs alternate between right and up, the number of right runs and up runs depends on whether the path starts with a right or an up. Let me clarify that.\n\nIf the path starts with a right run, then the runs will be right, up, right, up, etc. So, with five runs in total, starting with right, the number of right runs would be three and the number of up runs would be two.

So, three up segments and two right segments.\n\nSo, in both cases, the number of segments is five, with one more segment of the starting direction.\n\nNow, the next step is to figure out how to distribute the 8 right moves into 3 segments (if starting with right) or 2 segments (if starting with up). Similarly, for up moves.\n\nBut the key is that each segment must have at least one step. Because you can't have a segment of length zero; that would mean not moving at all in that direction, which isn't allowed. So, each segment must have at least one step.\n\nTherefore, for Case 1: Starting with right, we have 3 right segments and 2 up segments. Each right segment has at least 1 right step, each up segment has at least 1 up step.\n\nSo, the number of ways to distribute the right steps is the number of integer solutions to:\n\nr1 + r2 + r3 = 8, where r1, r2, r3 >= 1.\n\nSimilarly, for up steps, u1 + u2 = 8, with u1, u2 >=1.\n\nSimilarly, for Case 2: Starting with up, u1 + u2 + u3 =8, r1 + r2 =8, each term >=1.\n\nSo, for each case, the number of ways is the product of the combinations for each direction.\n\nThe number of ways to distribute k indistinct items into n distinct boxes with each box having at least 1 is C(k-1, n-1). So, for each direction, it's a stars and bars problem.\n\nSo, for Case 1:\n\nRight segments: 3 segments, each at least 1.

Again, five segments, starting and ending with U.\n\nSo either way, the path has five segments, alternating between R and U, and the number of direction changes is four. So now, the problem reduces to finding the number of such paths in each case and then adding them together.\n\nSo, let's model each case. Let's take Case 1 first: the path starts with R, then U, R, U, R.\n\nEach R segment contributes some number of right moves, and each U segment contributes some number of up moves. Since the total right moves are 8, the sum of the R segments must be 8, and the sum of the U segments must be 8.\n\nMoreover, each segment must have at least one step because you can't have a segment of zero length. So each R segment is at least 1, and each U segment is at least 1.\n\nIn Case 1, there are three R segments (since the path starts with R and alternates, so segments 1,3,5 are R) and two U segments (segments 2 and 4). So, the problem becomes partitioning 8 into three positive integers for the R segments, and partitioning 8 into two positive integers for the U segments.\n\nSimilarly, in Case 2, starting with U, we have three U segments and two R segments. So, we'll have to partition 8 into three U segments and 8 into two R segments.\n\nThe number of ways to partition 8 into k positive integers is given by the stars and bars theorem. For n items into k bins, it's C(n-1, k-1). So for each case, the number of ways is the product of the number of ways to partition the rights and the number of ways to partition the ups.\n\nLet me write this down.\n\nIn Case 1:\n- Number of ways to partition R steps (8 into 3 parts): C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2)\n- Number of ways to partition U steps (8 into 2 parts): C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1)\nSo total ways for Case 1: C(7,2) * C(7,1)\n\nSimilarly, in Case 2:\n- Number of ways to partition U steps (8 into 3 parts): C(7,2)\n- Number of ways to partition R steps (8 into 2 parts): C(7,1)\nSo total ways for Case 2: C(7,2) * C(7,1)\n\nSince both cases are symmetric, the total number of paths is 2 * [C(7,2) * C(7,1)]",

So, whether starting with right or up, the number of segments of each direction will differ by one.\n\nSpecifically, if starting with right, there are three R segments and two U segments. If starting with up, it's three U segments and two R segments.\n\nSo, regardless of starting direction, one direction will have three segments and the other two.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to two cases: paths starting with right and paths starting with up. Each case will have a different distribution of steps.\n\nLet me handle each case separately.\n\nCase 1: Starting with right.\n\nWe have three R segments and two U segments. The total R steps are 8, so we need to distribute 8 R steps into three segments, each at least 1. Similarly, the U steps are 8, distributed into two segments, each at least 1.\n\nSimilarly, Case 2: Starting with up.\n\nWe have three U segments and two R segments. The same logic applies: 8 U steps into three segments, each at least 1, and 8 R steps into two segments, each at least 1.\n\nSo, for each case, the number of ways is the product of the number of ways to distribute the R steps and the number of ways to distribute the U steps.\n\nThe number of ways to distribute n identical items into k bins, each bin at least 1, is C(n-1, k-1). So, for the R steps in Case 1: 8 R into 3 segments: C(7,2). Similarly, 8 U into 2 segments: C(7,1).\n\nSo, for Case 1: C(7,2) * C(7,1).\n\nSimilarly, for Case 2: 8 U into 3 segments: C(7,2), and 8 R into 2 segments: C(7,1). So, same as Case 1.\n\nTherefore, the total number of paths is 2 * [C(7,2) * C(7,1)].",

Similarly, if starting with up, it's up, right, up, right, up. So, three up segments and two right segments.\n\nSo, in both cases, the number of segments is five, with one more segment of the starting direction.\n\nNow, the next step is to figure out how to distribute the 8 right moves into 3 segments (if starting with right) or 2 segments (if starting with up). Similarly, for up moves.\n\nBut the key is that each segment must have at least one step. Because you can't have a segment of length zero; that would mean not moving at all in that direction, which isn't allowed. So, each segment must have at least one step.\n\nTherefore, for Case 1: Starting with right, we have 3 right segments and 2 up segments. Each right segment has at least 1 right step, each up segment has at least 1 up step.\n\nSo, the number of ways to distribute the right steps is the number of integer solutions to:\n\nr1 + r2 + r3 = 8, where r1, r2, r3 >= 1.\n\nSimilarly, for up steps, u1 + u2 = 8, with u1, u2 >=1.\n\nSimilarly, for Case 2: Starting with up, u1 + u2 + u3 =8, r1 + r2 =8, each term >=1.\n\nSo, for each case, the number of ways is the product of the combinations for each direction.\n\nThe number of ways to distribute k indistinct items into n distinct boxes with each box having at least 1 is C(k-1, n-1). So, for each direction, it's a stars and bars problem.\n\nSo, for Case 1:\n\nRight segments: 3 segments, each at least 1.

So, if you have k runs, you have k-1 direction changes.\n\nSo, in the 2x2 grid, for a path with two direction changes, that's three runs. So, starting with R, the runs would be R, U, R. But in that case, the U run would have length 1, and the R runs would have lengths 1 and 1, summing to 2. So, the number of ways for R runs is C(2-1,2-1) = C(1,1)=1. For U runs, it's C(2-1,1-1)=C(1,0)=1. So, 1*1=1 path starting with R. Similarly, starting with U, U runs would be partitioned into two parts: 2 into 2 parts, which is 1 way, and R runs into one part: 2 into 1 part, 1 way. So, 1*1=1 path. So, total two paths, which matches the enumeration.\n\nSo, applying this to the original problem. For an 8x8 grid, the path has 16 steps, 8 R and 8 U. We need exactly four direction changes, which means five runs. So, five runs can be either starting with R or U.\n\nCase 1: Starting with R. So, the runs are R, U, R, U, R. So, three R runs and two U runs. The sum of the R runs is 8, each at least 1. The number of compositions is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2)=21. Similarly, the number of compositions for U runs is C(8-1,2-1)=C(7,1)=7. So, the number of paths starting with R is 21 *7=147.\n\nCase 2: Starting with U. The runs are U, R, U, R, U. So, three U runs and two R runs. The number of compositions for U runs is 21, and for R runs is 7. So, 21*7=147.\n\nTherefore, total number of paths is 147+147=294.",

Now, these runs can be either all starting with R or starting with U, but in this case, since the path starts at (0,0) and ends at (8,8), the number of R and U steps is the same, so the number of runs in each direction must be either equal or differ by one, I think.",

The total number of right steps is 8, so the number of ways to distribute 8 steps into 3 segments is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2). Similarly, for up steps, 8 steps into 2 segments: C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1).",

Similarly, two U runs, each with a positive number of steps.\n\nSo, the number of ways to compose 8 R steps into 3 runs is C(8-1, 3-1) = C(7,2) = 21. Similarly, the number of ways to compose 8 U steps into 2 runs is C(8-1, 2-1) = C(7,1) =7. So, the number of such paths starting with R would be 21 * 7 = 147.\n\nSimilarly, if the path starts with U, then there are three U runs and two R runs. So, the number of ways to compose 8 U steps into 3 runs is C(7,2)=21, and the number of ways to compose 8 R steps into 2 runs is 7. So, the number of such paths starting with U is also 21*7=147.\n\nTherefore, the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times would be 147 + 147 = 294.",

Each has one direction change, so one direction change. Which is exactly one direction change. So, according to the formula, runs would be two, so direction changes one.\n\nUsing our formula: starting with right, runs are one right, one up. The number of ways to split 1 right into one run is 1, and 1 up into one run is 1. So, 1*1=1 for starting right, same for starting up, so total 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo, our formula seems to hold for smaller grids.\n\nTherefore, returning to the original problem: 8x8 grid, starting from lower left to upper right, path length 16, exactly four direction changes.\n\nSo, four direction changes imply five runs. Each run is either right or up, starting with either direction.\n\nSo, as we found earlier, for each starting direction, the number of paths is C(7,2)*C(7,1)=21*7=147.

If the path starts with R, then the number of R runs is three and U runs is two. So, we have three runs of R and two runs of U. Each run must have at least one step, right? Because you can't have a run of zero steps. So, the problem becomes distributing the 8 R's into three runs and 8 U's into two runs.\n\nSimilarly, if the path starts with U, then it's distributing 8 U's into three runs and 8 R's into two runs.\n\nSo, for each starting direction, we can compute the number of ways, then add them together.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let\u2019s say we start with R. Then, we have three runs of R and two runs of U.

So, three up segments and two right segments.\n\nSo, in both cases, the number of segments is five, with one more segment of the starting direction.\n\nNow, the next step is to figure out how to distribute the 8 right moves into 3 segments (if starting with right) or 2 segments (if starting with up). Similarly, for up moves.\n\nBut the key is that each segment must have at least one step. Because you can't have a segment of length zero; that would mean not moving at all in that direction, which isn't allowed. So, each segment must have at least one step.\n\nTherefore, for Case 1: Starting with right, we have 3 right segments and 2 up segments. Each right segment has at least 1 right step, each up segment has at least 1 up step.\n\nSo, the number of ways to distribute the right steps is the number of integer solutions to:\n\nr1 + r2 + r3 = 8, where r1, r2, r3 >= 1.\n\nSimilarly, for up steps, u1 + u2 = 8, with u1, u2 >=1.\n\nSimilarly, for Case 2: Starting with up, u1 + u2 + u3 =8, r1 + r2 =8, each term >=1.\n\nSo, for each case, the number of ways is the product of the combinations for each direction.\n\nThe number of ways to distribute k indistinct items into n distinct boxes with each box having at least 1 is C(k-1, n-1). So, for each direction, it's a stars and bars problem.\n\nSo, for Case 1:\n\nRight segments: 3 segments, each at least 1.

Again, five segments, starting and ending with U.\n\nSo either way, the path has five segments, alternating between R and U, and the number of direction changes is four. So now, the problem reduces to finding the number of such paths in each case and then adding them together.\n\nSo, let's model each case. Let's take Case 1 first: the path starts with R, then U, R, U, R.\n\nEach R segment contributes some number of right moves, and each U segment contributes some number of up moves. Since the total right moves are 8, the sum of the R segments must be 8, and the sum of the U segments must be 8.\n\nMoreover, each segment must have at least one step because you can't have a segment of zero length. So each R segment is at least 1, and each U segment is at least 1.\n\nIn Case 1, there are three R segments (since the path starts with R and alternates, so segments 1,3,5 are R) and two U segments (segments 2 and 4). So, the problem becomes partitioning 8 into three positive integers for the R segments, and partitioning 8 into two positive integers for the U segments.\n\nSimilarly, in Case 2, starting with U, we have three U segments and two R segments. So, we'll have to partition 8 into three U segments and 8 into two R segments.\n\nThe number of ways to partition 8 into k positive integers is given by the stars and bars theorem. For n items into k bins, it's C(n-1, k-1). So for each case, the number of ways is the product of the number of ways to partition the rights and the number of ways to partition the ups.\n\nLet me write this down.\n\nIn Case 1:\n- Number of ways to partition R steps (8 into 3 parts): C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2)\n- Number of ways to partition U steps (8 into 2 parts): C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1)\nSo total ways for Case 1: C(7,2) * C(7,1)\n\nSimilarly, in Case 2:\n- Number of ways to partition U steps (8 into 3 parts): C(7,2)\n- Number of ways to partition R steps (8 into 2 parts): C(7,1)\nSo total ways for Case 2: C(7,2) * C(7,1)\n\nSince both cases are symmetric, the total number of paths is 2 * [C(7,2) * C(7,1)]",

Each case will have a different distribution of steps.\n\nLet me handle each case separately.\n\nCase 1: Starting with right.\n\nWe have three R segments and two U segments. The total R steps are 8, so we need to distribute 8 R steps into three segments, each at least 1. Similarly, the U steps are 8, distributed into two segments, each at least 1.\n\nSimilarly, Case 2: Starting with up.\n\nWe have three U segments and two R segments.

Similarly, for up moves.\n\nBut the key is that each segment must have at least one step. Because you can't have a segment of length zero; that would mean not moving at all in that direction, which isn't allowed. So, each segment must have at least one step.\n\nTherefore, for Case 1: Starting with right, we have 3 right segments and 2 up segments. Each right segment has at least 1 right step, each up segment has at least 1 up step.\n\nSo, the number of ways to distribute the right steps is the number of integer solutions to:\n\nr1 + r2 + r3 = 8, where r1, r2, r3 >= 1.\n\nSimilarly, for up steps, u1 + u2 = 8, with u1, u2 >=1.\n\nSimilarly, for Case 2: Starting with up, u1 + u2 + u3 =8, r1 + r2 =8, each term >=1.\n\nSo, for each case, the number of ways is the product of the combinations for each direction.\n\nThe number of ways to distribute k indistinct items into n distinct boxes with each box having at least 1 is C(k-1, n-1).

So, the number of right segments and up segments will influence how the 8 rights and 8 ups are distributed.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to model this is by considering the number of ways to distribute the right steps into right segments and the up steps into up segments.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- If the path starts with a right, then there are three right segments and two up segments.\n\n- If the path starts with an up, then there are three up segments and two right segments.\n\nSo, for both cases, we can compute the number of such paths and then sum them.\n\nSo, the total number of paths with exactly four direction changes is the sum of the number of paths starting with right and the number starting with up.\n\nLet's first consider the case where the path starts with a right move.\n\nCase 1: Starting with Right\n\nNumber of right segments: 3\n\nNumber of up segments: 2\n\nWe have 8 right steps to distribute into 3 right segments, each of which has at least 1 step.

That's a stars and bars problem. The formula for that is C(n-1, k-1) where n is the number of items and k is the number of containers. So, for right steps: C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21.\n\nSimilarly, for the up steps: 8 up steps into 2 segments, each at least 1.

But the total right moves must be 8, and the total up moves must be 8.\n\nSo, if I have five segments, some of which are right (R) and some are up (U). The number of R segments plus U segments equals five. So, let me denote the number of R segments as k, then the number of U segments is 5 - k.\n\nEach R segment must have at least one step, right?

So, the number of right segments and up segments will influence how the 8 rights and 8 ups are distributed.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to model this is by considering the number of ways to distribute the right steps into right segments and the up steps into up segments.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- If the path starts with a right, then there are three right segments and two up segments.\n\n- If the path starts with an up, then there are three up segments and two right segments.\n\nSo, for both cases, we can compute the number of such paths and then sum them.\n\nSo, the total number of paths with exactly four direction changes is the sum of the number of paths starting with right and the number starting with up.\n\nLet's first consider the case where the path starts with a right move.\n\nCase 1: Starting with Right\n\nNumber of right segments: 3\n\nNumber of up segments: 2\n\nWe have 8 right steps to distribute into 3 right segments, each of which has at least 1 step.

This is a stars and bars problem.\n\nThe formula for the number of solutions is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21.\n\nSimilarly, for the U runs, since there are two U runs, the number of ways is C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1) =7.\n\nTherefore, the number of paths in Case 1 is 21 * 7 = 147.\n\nSimilarly, for Case 2: Starting with U.\n\nWe have three U runs and two R runs.\n\nNumber of ways to distribute U steps into three runs: C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2)=21.\n\nNumber of ways to distribute R steps into two runs: C(8-1,2-1)=C(7,1)=7.\n\nSo, number of paths in Case 2 is 21 *7=147.\n\nTherefore, total number of paths is 147 +147= 294.",

If the path starts with R, then the number of R runs is three and U runs is two. So, we have three runs of R and two runs of U. Each run must have at least one step, right?

So, if you have k runs, you have k-1 direction changes.\n\nSo, in the 2x2 grid, for a path with two direction changes, that's three runs. So, starting with R, the runs would be R, U, R. But in that case, the U run would have length 1, and the R runs would have lengths 1 and 1, summing to 2. So, the number of ways for R runs is C(2-1,2-1) = C(1,1)=1. For U runs, it's C(2-1,1-1)=C(1,0)=1. So, 1*1=1 path starting with R. Similarly, starting with U, U runs would be partitioned into two parts: 2 into 2 parts, which is 1 way, and R runs into one part: 2 into 1 part, 1 way. So, 1*1=1 path.

So, three R runs and two U runs. The sum of the R runs is 8, each at least 1. The number of compositions is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2)=21.

But the total right moves must be 8, and the total up moves must be 8.\n\nSo, if I have five segments, some of which are right (R) and some are up (U).

So, if the first run is R, the next is U, then R, then U, then R. Similarly, if the first run is U, the sequence is U, R, U, R, U.\n\nSo, in the case of starting with R, we have three R runs and two U runs. Each R run has at least one R, and each U run has at least one U.\n\nSimilarly, starting with U, we have three U runs and two R runs.\n\nSo, in each case, the number of such paths is the number of ways to distribute the R's and U's across their respective runs.\n\nSo, for starting with R:\n\nNumber of ways to distribute R's: the number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts, each at least 1.

Each direction change is a switch from R to U or U to R.

So, if you have k runs, you have k-1 direction changes.\n\nSo, in the 2x2 grid, for a path with two direction changes, that's three runs. So, starting with R, the runs would be R, U, R. But in that case, the U run would have length 1, and the R runs would have lengths 1 and 1, summing to 2. So, the number of ways for R runs is C(2-1,2-1) = C(1,1)=1. For U runs, it's C(2-1,1-1)=C(1,0)=1. So, 1*1=1 path starting with R. Similarly, starting with U, U runs would be partitioned into two parts: 2 into 2 parts, which is 1 way, and R runs into one part: 2 into 1 part, 1 way. So, 1*1=1 path. So, total two paths, which matches the enumeration.\n\nSo, applying this to the original problem. For an 8x8 grid, the path has 16 steps, 8 R and 8 U. We need exactly four direction changes, which means five runs. So, five runs can be either starting with R or U.\n\nCase 1: Starting with R. So, the runs are R, U, R, U, R. So, three R runs and two U runs. The sum of the R runs is 8, each at least 1. The number of compositions is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2)=21.

So, three U runs and two R runs. The number of compositions for U runs is 21, and for R runs is 7. So, 21*7=147.\n\nTherefore, total number of paths is 147+147=294.",
