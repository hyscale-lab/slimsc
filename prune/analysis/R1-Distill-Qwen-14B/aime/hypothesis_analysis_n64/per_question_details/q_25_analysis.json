They would be in both the exactly three and exactly four categories, but no, because someone can't be in both. So, perhaps I need to approach this with inclusion-exclusion.\n\nLet me try to model this with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The formula for four sets is a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it because C is a universal set.\n\nSo, since everyone owns C, the total number of people is 900. Let me denote:\n\nn(C) = 900\n\nn(D) = 195\n\nn(G) = 367\n\nn(S) = 562\n\nWe\u2019re told that 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. Let's denote:\n\nExactly two: 437. These are people who own exactly two of the four items. Since C is always owned, exactly two could mean owning C and one other. So, for example, someone owns C and D, but not G or S. Similarly, C and G, but not D or S, etc.\n\nExactly three: 234. These own C and two others, but not all four. For example, C, D, G, but not S.\n\nAnd the number we need is those who own all four, which is C, D, G, S.\n\nSo, let me think in terms of the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets. The formula is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| = |C| + |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| - |D\u2229C| - |G\u2229C| - |S\u2229C| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229C| + |D\u2229S\u2229C| + |G\u2229S\u2229C| - |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C|\n\nBut since C is the universal set, everyone is in C. So, |D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| = 900.\n\nLet me compute the left side as 900. \n\nSo,\n\n900 = |C| + |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| - |D\u2229C| - |G\u2229C| - |S\u2229C| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229C| + |D\u2229S\u2229C| + |G\u2229S\u2229C| - |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C|\n\nBut since C is everyone, some terms simplify. For example, |D\u2229C| is just |D|, because everyone in D is in C. Similarly, |G\u2229C|=|G|, |S\u2229C|=|S|.\n\nSimilarly, |D\u2229G\u2229C| is |D\u2229G|, since all those in D\u2229G are in C.

So, someone owning exactly two things is someone who has C plus one more.

That would be b + c + d = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number owning exactly three things is 234, which would be e + f + g = 234.\n\nWe need to find h.\n\nAdditionally, the total number of people owning each of the other items (D, G, S) can be found by considering all the ways they are owned. For example, the number of people owning D is the sum of all the sets that include D.\n\nSo, the number of D owners is b + e + f + h = 195.\n\nSimilarly, G owners: c + e + g + h = 367.\n\nS owners: d + f + g + h = 562.\n\nNow, let's write down all the equations we have.\n\n1. a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 900\n2. b + c + d = 437\n3. e + f + g = 234\n4. b + e + f + h = 195\n5. c + e + g + h = 367\n6. d + f + g + h = 562\n\nWe need to find h.\n\nLet me see how I can solve these equations.\n\nFirst, from equation 2, b + c + d = 437.\n\nFrom equation 3, e + f + g = 234.\n\nLet me substitute these into equation 1.\n\nEquation 1: a + (b + c + d) + (e + f + g) + h = 900.\n\nSubstituting equation 2 and 3:\n\na + 437 + 234 + h = 900.\n\nSo, a + h = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nSo, equation 7: a + h = 229.\n\nNow, let's look at equations 4, 5, 6.\n\nEquation 4: b + e + f + h = 195.\n\nEquation 5: c + e + g + h = 367.\n\nEquation 6: d + f + g + h = 562.\n\nHmm, perhaps adding equations 4,5,6 together.\n\nSum of equations 4,5,6:\n\n(b + e + f + h) + (c + e + g + h) + (d + f + g + h) = 195 + 367 + 562.\n\nLet's compute the left side:\n\nb + c + d + 2e + 2f + 2g + 3h.\n\nBecause:\n\n- b, c, d each appear once.\n- e appears twice (in 4 and 5)\n- f appears twice (in 4 and 6)\n- g appears twice (in 5 and 6)\n- h appears three times (in 4,5,6).\n\nSo left side is (b + c + d) + 2*(e + f + g) + 3h.\n\nFrom equation 2, b + c + d =437.\n\nFrom equation 3, e + f + g =234.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nLeft side: 437 + 2*(234) + 3h = 437 + 468 + 3h = 905 + 3h.\n\nThe right side: 195 + 367 + 562.\n\nLet me compute that: 195 + 367 = 562, then 562 + 562 = 1124.\n\nSo, 905 + 3h = 1124.\n\nSubtract 905 from both sides: 3h = 1124 - 905 = 219.\n\nSo, 3h = 219 \u2192 h = 73.\n\nSo, the number of people who own all four items is 73.",

This count includes:\n\n- Those who own only A (but since D is universal, they also have D. So, someone owning only A would have exactly two things: A and D. So, that's part of the 437.\n\nSimilarly, people owning A and B would have exactly three things: A, B, D. So, part of the 234.\n\nPeople owning A and C similarly are part of 234.\n\nAnd those owning A, B, C are part of x.\n\nSame logic for B and C.\n\nSo, the total number of people owning A is equal to:\n\n- Number owning only A and D (part of exactly two): let's call this a_A.\n\n- Plus, those owning A, B, D (part of exactly three): a_AB.\n\n- Plus, those owning A, C, D (part of exactly three): a_AC.\n\n- Plus, those owning A, B, C, D (part of exactly four): x.\n\nSo, |A| = a_A + a_AB + a_AC + x.\n\nSimilarly for |B| and |C|.\n\nBut how does that help us? Let's think about the total counts.\n\nThe total number of people owning exactly two things is 437, which consists of:\n\n- a_A (A and D)\n\n- a_B (B and D)\n\n- a_C (C and D)\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning exactly three things is 234, which consists of:\n\n- a_AB (A, B, D)\n\n- a_AC (A, C, D)\n\n- a_BC (B, C, D)\n\nAnd the number of people owning exactly four things is x, which is a_ABC (A, B, C, D).\n\nSo, we can write equations:\n\nNumber of exactly two: a_A + a_B + a_C = 437.\n\nNumber of exactly three: a_AB + a_AC + a_BC = 234.\n\nNumber of exactly four: a_ABC = x.\n\nAlso, the total number of people is:\n\na (only D) + (a_A + a_B + a_C) + (a_AB + a_AC + a_BC) + a_ABC = 900.\n\nWhich we already expressed as a + x = 229.\n\nNow, for the individual sets:\n\n|A| = a_A + a_AB + a_AC + a_ABC = 195.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n|B| = a_B + a_AB + a_BC + a_ABC = 367.\n\n|C| = a_C + a_AC + a_BC + a_ABC = 562.\n\nSo, now we have a system of equations:\n\n1. a_A + a_B + a_C = 437.\n\n2. a_AB + a_AC + a_BC = 234.\n\n3. a_ABC = x.\n\n4. a + x = 229.\n\n5. a_A + a_AB + a_AC + x = 195.\n\n6. a_B + a_AB + a_BC + x = 367.\n\n7. a_C + a_AC + a_BC + x = 562.\n\nSo, that's seven equations with variables a, a_A, a_B, a_C, a_AB, a_AC, a_BC, x.\n\nWe need to find x.\n\nLet's see if we can express some variables in terms of others.\n\nFrom equation 5: a_A = 195 - (a_AB + a_AC + x).\n\nSimilarly, equation 6: a_B = 367 - (a_AB + a_BC + x).\n\nEquation 7: a_C = 562 - (a_AC + a_BC + x).\n\nSubstituting these into equation 1:\n\n(195 - (a_AB + a_AC + x)) + (367 - (a_AB + a_BC + x)) + (562 - (a_AC + a_BC + x)) = 437.\n\nLet me compute the left side:\n\n195 + 367 + 562 - [ (a_AB + a_AC + x) + (a_AB + a_BC + x) + (a_AC + a_BC + x) ] = 437.\n\nCompute the sum: 195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124.\n\nNow, the terms in the brackets:\n\n(a_AB + a_AC + x) + (a_AB + a_BC + x) + (a_AC + a_BC + x) \n\n= 2a_AB + 2a_AC + 2a_BC + 3x.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\n1124 - (2a_AB + 2a_AC + 2a_BC + 3x) = 437.\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n2a_AB + 2a_AC + 2a_BC + 3x = 1124 - 437 = 687.\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\na_AB + a_AC + a_BC + (3/2)x = 343.5.\n\nHmm, but from equation 2, a_AB + a_AC + a_BC = 234.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n234 + (3/2)x = 343.5.\n\nSubtract 234:\n\n(3/2)x = 343.5 - 234 = 109.5.\n\nMultiply both sides by (2/3):\n\nx = (109.5) * (2/3) = (219)/3 = 73.\n\nSo, x = 73.",

Let me re-read the problem.\n\n\"In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things.\"\n\nThe phrase \"these things\" refers back to the things mentioned earlier, which are diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade. Because it says \"in addition, each owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, the 437 and 234 are referring to exactly two and exactly three of the diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade. Because candy hearts are already included, but the problem is about the other three.\n\nSo, the problem is about three sets: A (diamond), B (golf), C (spade). Each resident can own 0, 1, 2, 3 of these, plus the candy hearts. But the count of exactly two and exactly three refers only to A, B, C.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to three sets A, B, C, and we know:\n\n- |A| = 195\n- |B| = 367\n- |C| = 562\n- Exactly two: 437\n- Exactly three: 234\n\nWe need to find |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|, which is the number of people who own all three of A, B, C.

Because if they didn't include candy hearts, that would imply they own zero other things, but that's not possible because they have candy hearts. So, no, that's not possible. So, when someone owns exactly two things, it must include candy hearts plus one other. Similarly, exactly three would include candy hearts plus two others.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, the 437 are the number of people who own exactly two things: candy hearts and one more.

So, the 195 includes:\n\n- Those who own only D and C (so exactly two things)\n- Those who own D, C, and one other (so exactly three things)\n- Those who own all four (D, G, S, C)\n\nSimilarly, for G and S.\n\nSo, let's denote the number of people who own exactly two things as follows:\n\n- Let x be the number who own D and C (and nothing else)\n- Let y be the number who own G and C\n- Let z be the number who own S and C\n- Then, the number of people who own exactly two things is x + y + z = 437.\n\nSimilarly, for exactly three things:\n\n- Let p be the number who own D, G, and C\n- Let q be the number who own D, S, and C\n- Let r be the number who own G, S, and C\n- Then, p + q + r = 234.\n\nAnd d is the number who own all four: D, G, S, C.\n\nSo, now, each of the counts for D, G, S can be written in terms of these variables.\n\nFor D: x (only D and C) + p (D, G, C) + q (D, S, C) + d (all four) = 195.\n\nSimilarly, for G: y (only G and C) + p (D, G, C) + r (G, S, C) + d = 367.\n\nFor S: z (only S and C) + q (D, S, C) + r (G, S, C) + d = 562.\n\nSo, let's write these equations:\n\n1. x + p + q + d = 195\n2. y + p + r + d = 367\n3. z + q + r + d = 562\n\nWe also have:\n\n4. x + y + z = 437 (number of exactly two-thing owners)\n5. p + q + r = 234 (number of exactly three-thing owners)\n6. a + d = 229 (from earlier, since a + b + c + d =900, and b=437, c=234)\n\nBut I'm not sure about a, but maybe we can express a in terms of other variables.",

The formula for four sets is a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it because C is a universal set.\n\nSo, since everyone owns C, the total number of people is 900.

Similarly, C and G, but not D or S, etc.\n\nExactly three: 234. These own C and two others, but not all four. For example, C, D, G, but not S.\n\nAnd the number we need is those who own all four, which is C, D, G, S.\n\nSo, let me think in terms of the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets.

So, |D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| = 900.\n\nLet me compute the left side as 900. \n\nSo,\n\n900 = |C| + |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| - |D\u2229C| - |G\u2229C| - |S\u2229C| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229C| + |D\u2229S\u2229C| + |G\u2229S\u2229C| - |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C|\n\nBut since C is everyone, some terms simplify. For example, |D\u2229C| is just |D|, because everyone in D is in C. Similarly, |G\u2229C|=|G|, |S\u2229C|=|S|.\n\nSimilarly, |D\u2229G\u2229C| is |D\u2229G|, since all those in D\u2229G are in C.

Since C is one of the four, and it's mandatory, but the count is about how many things they own. So, for example, if someone owns C and D, that's two things. If they own C, D, and G, that's three things. If they own C, D, G, and S, that's four.\n\nSo, the problem states that 437 own exactly two, meaning they own two of the four. Since C is always owned, that could be:\n\n- Exactly two: C and one other (so D, G, or S)\n- Or maybe two others without C? But that's impossible because C is mandatory. So, no, it must be that the two includes C. So, exactly two would mean C plus one other item.

Now, the total number of people is the sum of all these, but that might be complicated. Instead, perhaps we can use the given information.\n\nThe problem states that 437 own exactly two things. So, that's a + b + c. Because each of these (a, b, c) is the count of people owning exactly two of the four: C and one other.\n\nSimilarly, the 234 who own exactly three things would be d + e + f. Because each of these (d, e, f) is the count of people owning C plus two other items.\n\nAnd the remaining people would own exactly four things, which is g.\n\nSo, the total number of people is a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 900.",

For example, |R\u2229H| = |R|, because H includes everyone. Similarly, |R\u2229G\u2229H| = |R\u2229G|, and so on. \n\nSo, substituting into the formula:\n\n|R \u222a G \u222a S \u222a H| = 900 (since it's the universal set H)\n\nSo,\n\n900 = |R| + |G| + |S| + 900 - (|R\u2229G| + |R\u2229S| + |R\u2229H| + |G\u2229S| + |G\u2229H| + |S\u2229H|) + (|R\u2229G\u2229S| + |R\u2229G\u2229H| + |R\u2229S\u2229H| + |G\u2229S\u2229H|) - |R\u2229G\u2229S\u2229H|\n\nLet me simplify this. Subtract 900 from both sides:\n\n0 = |R| + |G| + |S| - (|R\u2229G| + |R\u2229S| + |R\u2229H| + |G\u2229S| + |G\u2229H| + |S\u2229H|) + (|R\u2229G\u2229S| + |R\u2229G\u2229H| + |R\u2229S\u2229H| + |G\u2229S\u2229H|) - |R\u2229G\u2229S\u2229H|\n\nBut |R\u2229H| = |R|, |G\u2229H| = |G|, |S\u2229H|=|S|. Similarly, |R\u2229G\u2229H| = |R\u2229G|, and so on. So let's substitute these in.\n\n0 = |R| + |G| + |S| - (|R\u2229G| + |R\u2229S| + |R| + |G\u2229S| + |G| + |S|) + (|R\u2229G\u2229S| + |R\u2229G| + |R\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|) - |R\u2229G\u2229S|\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, |R| + |G| + |S| = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124.\n\nNext, the terms subtracted are (|R\u2229G| + |R\u2229S| + |R| + |G\u2229S| + |G| + |S|). Let's calculate that:\n\n(|R\u2229G| + |R\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|) + (|R| + |G| + |S|) = (sum of pairwise intersections) + 1124.\n\nSimilarly, the terms added are (|R\u2229G\u2229S| + |R\u2229G| + |R\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|). So that's (sum of triple intersections) + (sum of pairwise intersections).\n\nAnd the last term subtracted is |R\u2229G\u2229S\u2229H|, which is |R\u2229G\u2229S|, since H is universal. \n\nSo putting it all back:\n\n0 = 1124 - [ (sum of pairwise intersections) + 1124 ] + [ (sum of triple intersections) + (sum of pairwise intersections) ] - |R\u2229G\u2229S|\n\nLet me rewrite this:\n\n0 = 1124 - sum_pairwise - 1124 + sum_triple + sum_pairwise - sum_triple",

Let me re-read the problem.\n\n\"In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things.\"\n\nThe phrase \"these things\" refers back to the things mentioned earlier, which are diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade. Because it says \"in addition, each owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, the 437 and 234 are referring to exactly two and exactly three of the diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade. Because candy hearts are already included, but the problem is about the other three.\n\nSo, the problem is about three sets: A (diamond), B (golf), C (spade). Each resident can own 0, 1, 2, 3 of these, plus the candy hearts. But the count of exactly two and exactly three refers only to A, B, C.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to three sets A, B, C, and we know:\n\n- |A| = 195\n- |B| = 367\n- |C| = 562\n- Exactly two: 437\n- Exactly three: 234\n\nWe need to find |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|, which is the number of people who own all three of A, B, C.

Because if they didn't include candy hearts, that would imply they own zero other things, but that's not possible because they have candy hearts. So, no, that's not possible. So, when someone owns exactly two things, it must include candy hearts plus one other. Similarly, exactly three would include candy hearts plus two others.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, the 437 are the number of people who own exactly two things: candy hearts and one more. Similarly, the 234 own exactly three things: candy hearts and two more.\n\nSo, with that in mind, let me try to model this.\n\nLet me denote:\n- D: set of people who own a diamond ring.\n- G: set of people who own golf clubs.\n- S: set of people who own a garden spade.\n- C: set of people who own candy hearts.

They would be in both the exactly three and exactly four categories, but no, because someone can't be in both. So, perhaps I need to approach this with inclusion-exclusion.\n\nLet me try to model this with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The formula for four sets is a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it because C is a universal set.\n\nSo, since everyone owns C, the total number of people is 900. Let me denote:\n\nn(C) = 900\n\nn(D) = 195\n\nn(G) = 367\n\nn(S) = 562\n\nWe\u2019re told that 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. Let's denote:\n\nExactly two: 437. These are people who own exactly two of the four items. Since C is always owned, exactly two could mean owning C and one other. So, for example, someone owns C and D, but not G or S. Similarly, C and G, but not D or S, etc.\n\nExactly three: 234. These own C and two others, but not all four. For example, C, D, G, but not S.\n\nAnd the number we need is those who own all four, which is C, D, G, S.\n\nSo, let me think in terms of the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets. The formula is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| = |C| + |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| - |D\u2229C| - |G\u2229C| - |S\u2229C| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229C| + |D\u2229S\u2229C| + |G\u2229S\u2229C| - |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C|\n\nBut since C is the universal set, everyone is in C. So, |D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| = 900.\n\nLet me compute the left side as 900. \n\nSo,\n\n900 = |C| + |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| - |D\u2229C| - |G\u2229C| - |S\u2229C| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229C| + |D\u2229S\u2229C| + |G\u2229S\u2229C| - |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C|\n\nBut since C is everyone, some terms simplify. For example, |D\u2229C| is just |D|, because everyone in D is in C. Similarly, |G\u2229C|=|G|, |S\u2229C|=|S|.\n\nSimilarly, |D\u2229G\u2229C| is |D\u2229G|, since all those in D\u2229G are in C.

For example, C, D, G, but not S.\n\nAnd the number we need is those who own all four, which is C, D, G, S.\n\nSo, let me think in terms of the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets. The formula is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| = |C| + |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| - |D\u2229C| - |G\u2229C| - |S\u2229C| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229C| + |D\u2229S\u2229C| + |G\u2229S\u2229C| - |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C|\n\nBut since C is the universal set, everyone is in C. So, |D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| = 900.\n\nLet me compute the left side as 900. \n\nSo,\n\n900 = |C| + |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| - |D\u2229C| - |G\u2229C| - |S\u2229C| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229C| + |D\u2229S\u2229C| + |G\u2229S\u2229C| - |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C|\n\nBut since C is everyone, some terms simplify. For example, |D\u2229C| is just |D|, because everyone in D is in C. Similarly, |G\u2229C|=|G|, |S\u2229C|=|S|.\n\nSimilarly, |D\u2229G\u2229C| is |D\u2229G|, since all those in D\u2229G are in C.

Subtract 900 from both sides:\n\n0 = |R| + |G| + |S| - (|R\u2229G| + |R\u2229S| + |R\u2229H| + |G\u2229S| + |G\u2229H| + |S\u2229H|) + (|R\u2229G\u2229S| + |R\u2229G\u2229H| + |R\u2229S\u2229H| + |G\u2229S\u2229H|) - |R\u2229G\u2229S\u2229H|\n\nBut |R\u2229H| = |R|, |G\u2229H| = |G|, |S\u2229H|=|S|. Similarly, |R\u2229G\u2229H| = |R\u2229G|, and so on. So let's substitute these in.\n\n0 = |R| + |G| + |S| - (|R\u2229G| + |R\u2229S| + |R| + |G\u2229S| + |G| + |S|) + (|R\u2229G\u2229S| + |R\u2229G| + |R\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|) - |R\u2229G\u2229S|\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, |R| + |G| + |S| = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124.\n\nNext, the terms subtracted are (|R\u2229G| + |R\u2229S| + |R| + |G\u2229S| + |G| + |S|). Let's calculate that:\n\n(|R\u2229G| + |R\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|) + (|R| + |G| + |S|) = (sum of pairwise intersections) + 1124.\n\nSimilarly, the terms added are (|R\u2229G\u2229S| + |R\u2229G| + |R\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|). So that's (sum of triple intersections) + (sum of pairwise intersections).\n\nAnd the last term subtracted is |R\u2229G\u2229S\u2229H|, which is |R\u2229G\u2229S|, since H is universal. \n\nSo putting it all back:\n\n0 = 1124 - [ (sum of pairwise intersections) + 1124 ] + [ (sum of triple intersections) + (sum of pairwise intersections) ] - |R\u2229G\u2229S|\n\nLet me rewrite this:\n\n0 = 1124 - sum_pairwise - 1124 + sum_triple + sum_pairwise - sum_triple",

Let me re-read the problem.\n\n\"In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things.\"\n\nThe phrase \"these things\" refers back to the things mentioned earlier, which are diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade. Because it says \"in addition, each owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, the 437 and 234 are referring to exactly two and exactly three of the diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade. Because candy hearts are already included, but the problem is about the other three.\n\nSo, the problem is about three sets: A (diamond), B (golf), C (spade). Each resident can own 0, 1, 2, 3 of these, plus the candy hearts. But the count of exactly two and exactly three refers only to A, B, C.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to three sets A, B, C, and we know:\n\n- |A| = 195\n- |B| = 367\n- |C| = 562\n- Exactly two: 437\n- Exactly three: 234\n\nWe need to find |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|, which is the number of people who own all three of A, B, C.

Because if they didn't include candy hearts, that would imply they own zero other things, but that's not possible because they have candy hearts. So, no, that's not possible. So, when someone owns exactly two things, it must include candy hearts plus one other. Similarly, exactly three would include candy hearts plus two others.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, the 437 are the number of people who own exactly two things: candy hearts and one more. Similarly, the 234 own exactly three things: candy hearts and two more.\n\nSo, with that in mind, let me try to model this.\n\nLet me denote:\n- D: set of people who own a diamond ring.\n- G: set of people who own golf clubs.\n- S: set of people who own a garden spade.\n- C: set of people who own candy hearts.

So, |D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| = 900.\n\nLet me compute the left side as 900. \n\nSo,\n\n900 = |C| + |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| - |D\u2229C| - |G\u2229C| - |S\u2229C| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229C| + |D\u2229S\u2229C| + |G\u2229S\u2229C| - |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C|\n\nBut since C is everyone, some terms simplify. For example, |D\u2229C| is just |D|, because everyone in D is in C. Similarly, |G\u2229C|=|G|, |S\u2229C|=|S|.\n\nSimilarly, |D\u2229G\u2229C| is |D\u2229G|, since all those in D\u2229G are in C. Similarly, |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C| is |D\u2229G\u2229S|, because all in D\u2229G\u2229S are in C.\n\nSo, substituting these into the equation:\n\n900 = |C| + |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| - |D| - |G| - |S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| - |D\u2229G\u2229S|",
          "text2": "Wait, that makes sense. So, in terms of the counts, the 437 owning exactly two things would be C + one other item, and the 234 owning exactly three would be C + two others. The ones who own all four would be C + all three others.\n\nSo, let me denote:\n- Let a = number of people owning only D and C (i.e., exactly two things: D and C)\n- Similarly, b = exactly two: G and C\n- c = exactly two: S and C\n- Then, the number of people owning exactly two things is a + b + c = 437.\n\nSimilarly, let d = number owning exactly three things. These would be people owning C plus two of D, G, S. There are three possibilities for exactly three: D, G, C; D, S, C; G, S, C. So, d1, d2, d3, but the total is d1 + d2 + d3 = 234.\n\nAnd let e be the number of people owning all four, which is C + D + G + S.

Let me re-read the problem.\n\n\"In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things.\"\n\nThe phrase \"these things\" refers back to the things mentioned earlier, which are diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade. Because it says \"in addition, each owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, the 437 and 234 are referring to exactly two and exactly three of the diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade. Because candy hearts are already included, but the problem is about the other three.\n\nSo, the problem is about three sets: A (diamond), B (golf), C (spade). Each resident can own 0, 1, 2, 3 of these, plus the candy hearts. But the count of exactly two and exactly three refers only to A, B, C.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to three sets A, B, C, and we know:\n\n- |A| = 195\n- |B| = 367\n- |C| = 562\n- Exactly two: 437\n- Exactly three: 234\n\nWe need to find |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|, which is the number of people who own all three of A, B, C.

So, when the problem says \"437 residents who own exactly two of these things,\" it's talking about exactly two, including the candy hearts. Because if they didn't include candy hearts, that would imply they own zero other things, but that's not possible because they have candy hearts. So, no, that's not possible. So, when someone owns exactly two things, it must include candy hearts plus one other. Similarly, exactly three would include candy hearts plus two others.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, the 437 are the number of people who own exactly two things: candy hearts and one more. Similarly, the 234 own exactly three things: candy hearts and two more.\n\nSo, with that in mind, let me try to model this.\n\nLet me denote:\n- D: set of people who own a diamond ring.\n- G: set of people who own golf clubs.\n- S: set of people who own a garden spade.\n- C: set of people who own candy hearts.

So |DG| = a + x, where a is exactly D, G, C, and x is all four.\n\nSimilarly, |DS| = b + x, and |GS| = c + x.\n\nSo sum of |DG| + |DS| + |GS| = (a + x) + (b + x) + (c + x) = (a + b + c) + 3x.\n\nAnd |DGS| is the number of people owning all three D, G, S, which is x (since they also own C).\n\nSo substituting into the equation:\n\n(a + b + c) + 3x - x = 224 \u2192 (a + b + c) + 2x = 224.\n\nBut a + b + c is the number of people owning exactly three items, which is y = 234.\n\nSo:\n\n234 + 2x = 224 \u2192 2x = -10 \u2192 x = -5.\n\nThis can't be possible because the number of people can't be negative. So I must have made a mistake in the setup.",

They would be in both the exactly three and exactly four categories, but no, because someone can't be in both. So, perhaps I need to approach this with inclusion-exclusion.\n\nLet me try to model this with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The formula for four sets is a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it because C is a universal set.\n\nSo, since everyone owns C, the total number of people is 900. Let me denote:\n\nn(C) = 900\n\nn(D) = 195\n\nn(G) = 367\n\nn(S) = 562\n\nWe\u2019re told that 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. Let's denote:\n\nExactly two: 437. These are people who own exactly two of the four items. Since C is always owned, exactly two could mean owning C and one other. So, for example, someone owns C and D, but not G or S. Similarly, C and G, but not D or S, etc.\n\nExactly three: 234. These own C and two others, but not all four. For example, C, D, G, but not S.\n\nAnd the number we need is those who own all four, which is C, D, G, S.\n\nSo, let me think in terms of the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets. The formula is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| = |C| + |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| - |D\u2229C| - |G\u2229C| - |S\u2229C| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229C| + |D\u2229S\u2229C| + |G\u2229S\u2229C| - |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C|\n\nBut since C is the universal set, everyone is in C. So, |D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| = 900.\n\nLet me compute the left side as 900. \n\nSo,\n\n900 = |C| + |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| - |D\u2229C| - |G\u2229C| - |S\u2229C| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229C| + |D\u2229S\u2229C| + |G\u2229S\u2229C| - |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C|\n\nBut since C is everyone, some terms simplify. For example, |D\u2229C| is just |D|, because everyone in D is in C. Similarly, |G\u2229C|=|G|, |S\u2229C|=|S|.\n\nSimilarly, |D\u2229G\u2229C| is |D\u2229G|, since all those in D\u2229G are in C. Similarly, |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C| is |D\u2229G\u2229S|, because all in D\u2229G\u2229S are in C.\n\nSo, substituting these into the equation:\n\n900 = |C| + |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| - |D| - |G| - |S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| - |D\u2229G\u2229S|",

So, exactly three of the four would consist of C plus two optional items.\n\nSimilarly, exactly two of the four would be C plus one optional item.\n\nSo, the counts are:\n\n- Exactly two things (C plus one optional): 437\n\n- Exactly three things (C plus two optional): 234\n\nAnd the rest are:\n\n- Exactly one thing (only C): let's call this number x.\n\n- Exactly four things (C plus all three optional): this is the number we're trying to find, y.\n\nSo, the total number of residents would be:\n\nx (only C) + 437 (C + one optional) + 234 (C + two optional) + y (C + all three optional) = 900\n\nSo, x + 437 + 234 + y = 900\n\nAdding 437 and 234: 437 + 234 = 671\n\nSo, x + y + 671 = 900\n\nThus, x + y = 900 - 671 = 229\n\nSo, x (only C) + y (all four) = 229.\n\nNow, to find y, we need another equation.

Let me denote:\n\nn(C) = 900\n\nn(D) = 195\n\nn(G) = 367\n\nn(S) = 562\n\nWe\u2019re told that 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. Let's denote:\n\nExactly two: 437. These are people who own exactly two of the four items. Since C is always owned, exactly two could mean owning C and one other. So, for example, someone owns C and D, but not G or S. Similarly, C and G, but not D or S, etc.\n\nExactly three: 234. These own C and two others, but not all four. For example, C, D, G, but not S.\n\nAnd the number we need is those who own all four, which is C, D, G, S.\n\nSo, let me think in terms of the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets. The formula is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| = |C| + |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| - |D\u2229C| - |G\u2229C| - |S\u2229C| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229C| + |D\u2229S\u2229C| + |G\u2229S\u2229C| - |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C|\n\nBut since C is the universal set, everyone is in C. So, |D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| = 900.\n\nLet me compute the left side as 900. \n\nSo,\n\n900 = |C| + |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| - |D\u2229C| - |G\u2229C| - |S\u2229C| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229C| + |D\u2229S\u2229C| + |G\u2229S\u2229C| - |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C|\n\nBut since C is everyone, some terms simplify. For example, |D\u2229C| is just |D|, because everyone in D is in C. Similarly, |G\u2229C|=|G|, |S\u2229C|=|S|.\n\nSimilarly, |D\u2229G\u2229C| is |D\u2229G|, since all those in D\u2229G are in C.

So |D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| = 900.\n\nBut since C is universal, the union of D, G, S, and C is just the same as the union of D, G, and S, because everyone is already in C. So |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900.\n\nSo now, applying inclusion-exclusion for three sets D, G, S, we can write:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D \u2229 G| - |D \u2229 S| - |G \u2229 S| + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|\n\nBut |D \u222a G \u222a S| is 900, as established. So:\n\n900 = 195 + 367 + 562 - |D \u2229 G| - |D \u2229 S| - |G \u2229 S| + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|\n\nLet me calculate the sum of |D|, |G|, |S|:\n\n195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124.\n\nSo 900 = 1124 - (sum of pairwise intersections) + (triple intersection)\n\nSo rearranged:\n\nsum of pairwise intersections - triple intersection = 1124 - 900 = 224.\n\nSo, (|D \u2229 G| + |D \u2229 S| + |G \u2229 S|) - |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| = 224.\n\nHmm, but I don't know the individual pairwise intersections or the triple intersection.",

For example, the number of people owning D is the sum of all the sets that include D.\n\nSo, the number of D owners is b + e + f + h = 195.\n\nSimilarly, G owners: c + e + g + h = 367.\n\nS owners: d + f + g + h = 562.\n\nNow, let's write down all the equations we have.\n\n1. a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 900\n2. b + c + d = 437\n3. e + f + g = 234\n4. b + e + f + h = 195\n5. c + e + g + h = 367\n6. d + f + g + h = 562\n\nWe need to find h.\n\nLet me see how I can solve these equations.\n\nFirst, from equation 2, b + c + d = 437.\n\nFrom equation 3, e + f + g = 234.\n\nLet me substitute these into equation 1.\n\nEquation 1: a + (b + c + d) + (e + f + g) + h = 900.\n\nSubstituting equation 2 and 3:\n\na + 437 + 234 + h = 900.\n\nSo, a + h = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nSo, equation 7: a + h = 229.\n\nNow, let's look at equations 4, 5, 6.\n\nEquation 4: b + e + f + h = 195.\n\nEquation 5: c + e + g + h = 367.\n\nEquation 6: d + f + g + h = 562.\n\nHmm, perhaps adding equations 4,5,6 together.\n\nSum of equations 4,5,6:\n\n(b + e + f + h) + (c + e + g + h) + (d + f + g + h) = 195 + 367 + 562.\n\nLet's compute the left side:\n\nb + c + d + 2e + 2f + 2g + 3h.\n\nBecause:\n\n- b, c, d each appear once.\n- e appears twice (in 4 and 5)\n- f appears twice (in 4 and 6)\n- g appears twice (in 5 and 6)\n- h appears three times (in 4,5,6).\n\nSo left side is (b + c + d) + 2*(e + f + g) + 3h.\n\nFrom equation 2, b + c + d =437.\n\nFrom equation 3, e + f + g =234.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nLeft side: 437 + 2*(234) + 3h = 437 + 468 + 3h = 905 + 3h.\n\nThe right side: 195 + 367 + 562.\n\nLet me compute that: 195 + 367 = 562, then 562 + 562 = 1124.\n\nSo, 905 + 3h = 1124.\n\nSubtract 905 from both sides: 3h = 1124 - 905 = 219.\n\nSo, 3h = 219 \u2192 h = 73.\n\nSo, the number of people who own all four items is 73.",

Let's think about the total counts.\n\nThe total number of people owning exactly two things is 437, which consists of:\n\n- a_A (A and D)\n\n- a_B (B and D)\n\n- a_C (C and D)\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning exactly three things is 234, which consists of:\n\n- a_AB (A, B, D)\n\n- a_AC (A, C, D)\n\n- a_BC (B, C, D)\n\nAnd the number of people owning exactly four things is x, which is a_ABC (A, B, C, D).\n\nSo, we can write equations:\n\nNumber of exactly two: a_A + a_B + a_C = 437.\n\nNumber of exactly three: a_AB + a_AC + a_BC = 234.\n\nNumber of exactly four: a_ABC = x.\n\nAlso, the total number of people is:\n\na (only D) + (a_A + a_B + a_C) + (a_AB + a_AC + a_BC) + a_ABC = 900.\n\nWhich we already expressed as a + x = 229.\n\nNow, for the individual sets:\n\n|A| = a_A + a_AB + a_AC + a_ABC = 195.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n|B| = a_B + a_AB + a_BC + a_ABC = 367.\n\n|C| = a_C + a_AC + a_BC + a_ABC = 562.\n\nSo, now we have a system of equations:\n\n1. a_A + a_B + a_C = 437.\n\n2. a_AB + a_AC + a_BC = 234.\n\n3. a_ABC = x.\n\n4. a + x = 229.\n\n5. a_A + a_AB + a_AC + x = 195.\n\n6. a_B + a_AB + a_BC + x = 367.\n\n7. a_C + a_AC + a_BC + x = 562.\n\nSo, that's seven equations with variables a, a_A, a_B, a_C, a_AB, a_AC, a_BC, x.\n\nWe need to find x.\n\nLet's see if we can express some variables in terms of others.\n\nFrom equation 5: a_A = 195 - (a_AB + a_AC + x).\n\nSimilarly, equation 6: a_B = 367 - (a_AB + a_BC + x).\n\nEquation 7: a_C = 562 - (a_AC + a_BC + x).\n\nSubstituting these into equation 1:\n\n(195 - (a_AB + a_AC + x)) + (367 - (a_AB + a_BC + x)) + (562 - (a_AC + a_BC + x)) = 437.\n\nLet me compute the left side:\n\n195 + 367 + 562 - [ (a_AB + a_AC + x) + (a_AB + a_BC + x) + (a_AC + a_BC + x) ] = 437.\n\nCompute the sum: 195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124.\n\nNow, the terms in the brackets:\n\n(a_AB + a_AC + x) + (a_AB + a_BC + x) + (a_AC + a_BC + x) \n\n= 2a_AB + 2a_AC + 2a_BC + 3x.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\n1124 - (2a_AB + 2a_AC + 2a_BC + 3x) = 437.\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n2a_AB + 2a_AC + 2a_BC + 3x = 1124 - 437 = 687.\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\na_AB + a_AC + a_BC + (3/2)x = 343.5.\n\nHmm, but from equation 2, a_AB + a_AC + a_BC = 234.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n234 + (3/2)x = 343.5.\n\nSubtract 234:\n\n(3/2)x = 343.5 - 234 = 109.5.\n\nMultiply both sides by (2/3):\n\nx = (109.5) * (2/3) = (219)/3 = 73.\n\nSo, x = 73.",

Let me re-read the problem.\n\n\"In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things.\"\n\nThe phrase \"these things\" refers back to the things mentioned earlier, which are diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade. Because it says \"in addition, each owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, the 437 and 234 are referring to exactly two and exactly three of the diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade. Because candy hearts are already included, but the problem is about the other three.\n\nSo, the problem is about three sets: A (diamond), B (golf), C (spade). Each resident can own 0, 1, 2, 3 of these, plus the candy hearts. But the count of exactly two and exactly three refers only to A, B, C.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to three sets A, B, C, and we know:\n\n- |A| = 195\n- |B| = 367\n- |C| = 562\n- Exactly two: 437\n- Exactly three: 234\n\nWe need to find |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|, which is the number of people who own all three of A, B, C. Because the candy hearts are universal, so owning all four would be the same as owning all three of A, B, C.\n\nSo, let's approach this with three sets.\n\nThe formula for the union of three sets is:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|.\n\nBut in this case, since the candy hearts are universal, the union of A, B, C is the total number of residents minus those who don't own any of A, B, C.",

So, when the problem says \"437 residents who own exactly two of these things,\" it's talking about exactly two, including the candy hearts. Because if they didn't include candy hearts, that would imply they own zero other things, but that's not possible because they have candy hearts. So, no, that's not possible. So, when someone owns exactly two things, it must include candy hearts plus one other. Similarly, exactly three would include candy hearts plus two others.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, the 437 are the number of people who own exactly two things: candy hearts and one more. Similarly, the 234 own exactly three things: candy hearts and two more.\n\nSo, with that in mind, let me try to model this.\n\nLet me denote:\n- D: set of people who own a diamond ring.\n- G: set of people who own golf clubs.\n- S: set of people who own a garden spade.\n- C: set of people who own candy hearts.

          "text1": "Wait, but that seems conflicting because if someone owns exactly two, it would be C plus one. But how about people who own all four? They would be in both the exactly three and exactly four categories, but no, because someone can't be in both. So, perhaps I need to approach this with inclusion-exclusion.\n\nLet me try to model this with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The formula for four sets is a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it because C is a universal set.\n\nSo, since everyone owns C, the total number of people is 900. Let me denote:\n\nn(C) = 900\n\nn(D) = 195\n\nn(G) = 367\n\nn(S) = 562\n\nWe\u2019re told that 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. Let's denote:\n\nExactly two: 437. These are people who own exactly two of the four items. Since C is always owned, exactly two could mean owning C and one other. So, for example, someone owns C and D, but not G or S. Similarly, C and G, but not D or S, etc.\n\nExactly three: 234. These own C and two others, but not all four. For example, C, D, G, but not S.\n\nAnd the number we need is those who own all four, which is C, D, G, S.\n\nSo, let me think in terms of the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets. The formula is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| = |C| + |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| - |D\u2229C| - |G\u2229C| - |S\u2229C| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229C| + |D\u2229S\u2229C| + |G\u2229S\u2229C| - |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C|\n\nBut since C is the universal set, everyone is in C. So, |D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| = 900.\n\nLet me compute the left side as 900. \n\nSo,\n\n900 = |C| + |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| - |D\u2229C| - |G\u2229C| - |S\u2229C| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229C| + |D\u2229S\u2229C| + |G\u2229S\u2229C| - |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C|\n\nBut since C is everyone, some terms simplify. For example, |D\u2229C| is just |D|, because everyone in D is in C. Similarly, |G\u2229C|=|G|, |S\u2229C|=|S|.\n\nSimilarly, |D\u2229G\u2229C| is |D\u2229G|, since all those in D\u2229G are in C. Similarly, |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C| is |D\u2229G\u2229S|, because all in D\u2229G\u2229S are in C.\n\nSo, substituting these into the equation:\n\n900 = |C| + |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| - |D| - |G| - |S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| - |D\u2229G\u2229S|",

For example, the number of people owning D is the sum of all the sets that include D.\n\nSo, the number of D owners is b + e + f + h = 195.\n\nSimilarly, G owners: c + e + g + h = 367.\n\nS owners: d + f + g + h = 562.\n\nNow, let's write down all the equations we have.\n\n1. a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 900\n2. b + c + d = 437\n3. e + f + g = 234\n4. b + e + f + h = 195\n5. c + e + g + h = 367\n6. d + f + g + h = 562\n\nWe need to find h.\n\nLet me see how I can solve these equations.\n\nFirst, from equation 2, b + c + d = 437.\n\nFrom equation 3, e + f + g = 234.\n\nLet me substitute these into equation 1.\n\nEquation 1: a + (b + c + d) + (e + f + g) + h = 900.\n\nSubstituting equation 2 and 3:\n\na + 437 + 234 + h = 900.\n\nSo, a + h = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nSo, equation 7: a + h = 229.\n\nNow, let's look at equations 4, 5, 6.\n\nEquation 4: b + e + f + h = 195.\n\nEquation 5: c + e + g + h = 367.\n\nEquation 6: d + f + g + h = 562.\n\nHmm, perhaps adding equations 4,5,6 together.\n\nSum of equations 4,5,6:\n\n(b + e + f + h) + (c + e + g + h) + (d + f + g + h) = 195 + 367 + 562.\n\nLet's compute the left side:\n\nb + c + d + 2e + 2f + 2g + 3h.\n\nBecause:\n\n- b, c, d each appear once.\n- e appears twice (in 4 and 5)\n- f appears twice (in 4 and 6)\n- g appears twice (in 5 and 6)\n- h appears three times (in 4,5,6).\n\nSo left side is (b + c + d) + 2*(e + f + g) + 3h.\n\nFrom equation 2, b + c + d =437.\n\nFrom equation 3, e + f + g =234.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nLeft side: 437 + 2*(234) + 3h = 437 + 468 + 3h = 905 + 3h.\n\nThe right side: 195 + 367 + 562.\n\nLet me compute that: 195 + 367 = 562, then 562 + 562 = 1124.\n\nSo, 905 + 3h = 1124.\n\nSubtract 905 from both sides: 3h = 1124 - 905 = 219.\n\nSo, 3h = 219 \u2192 h = 73.\n\nSo, the number of people who own all four items is 73.",

          "text1": "Wait, maybe the problem is that I'm including D (candy hearts) as one of the four, but the problem says \"these things\" when talking about exactly two. Let me re-read the problem.\n\n\"In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things.\"\n\nThe phrase \"these things\" refers back to the things mentioned earlier, which are diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade. Because it says \"in addition, each owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, the 437 and 234 are referring to exactly two and exactly three of the diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade. Because candy hearts are already included, but the problem is about the other three.\n\nSo, the problem is about three sets: A (diamond), B (golf), C (spade). Each resident can own 0, 1, 2, 3 of these, plus the candy hearts. But the count of exactly two and exactly three refers only to A, B, C.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to three sets A, B, C, and we know:\n\n- |A| = 195\n- |B| = 367\n- |C| = 562\n- Exactly two: 437\n- Exactly three: 234\n\nWe need to find |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|, which is the number of people who own all three of A, B, C. Because the candy hearts are universal, so owning all four would be the same as owning all three of A, B, C.\n\nSo, let's approach this with three sets.\n\nThe formula for the union of three sets is:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|.\n\nBut in this case, since the candy hearts are universal, the union of A, B, C is the total number of residents minus those who don't own any of A, B, C.",

So, when the problem says \"437 residents who own exactly two of these things,\" it's talking about exactly two, including the candy hearts. Because if they didn't include candy hearts, that would imply they own zero other things, but that's not possible because they have candy hearts. So, no, that's not possible. So, when someone owns exactly two things, it must include candy hearts plus one other. Similarly, exactly three would include candy hearts plus two others.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, the 437 are the number of people who own exactly two things: candy hearts and one more. Similarly, the 234 own exactly three things: candy hearts and two more.\n\nSo, with that in mind, let me try to model this.\n\nLet me denote:\n- D: set of people who own a diamond ring.\n- G: set of people who own golf clubs.\n- S: set of people who own a garden spade.\n- C: set of people who own candy hearts.
