Let's try possible divisors of 1,000,000.\n\nPossible integer roots are factors of 1,000,000, which include 1, 2, 4, 5, etc. Let me test a=100.\n\na=100:\n\n100\u00b3 - 300*(100)^2 + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0.\n\nYes, a=100 is a root. So, (a - 100) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or factor it.\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\nDivide a\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 by (a - 100).\n\nThe coefficients are 1, -300, 30,000, -1,000,000.\n\nBring down 1. Multiply by 100: 1*100=100.\n\nAdd to next coefficient: -300 + 100 = -200.\n\nMultiply by 100: -200*100 = -20,000.\n\nAdd to next coefficient: 30,000 + (-20,000) = 10,000.\n\nMultiply by 100: 10,000*100 = 1,000,000.\n\nAdd to last term: -1,000,000 + 1,000,000 = 0. So, no remainder.\n\nThus, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000) = 0.\n\nNow, solve a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000 = 0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\na = [200 \u00b1 sqrt(200\u00b2 - 4*1*10,000)] / 2 = [200 \u00b1 sqrt(40,000 - 40,000)] / 2 = [200 \u00b1 0]/2 = 100.\n\nSo, the equation has a triple root at a=100. So, the only solution is a=100 when we assumed a=b.\n\nThus, when a=b=100, c=300 - 2*100 = 100.\n\nSo, one solution is (100, 100, 100).\n\nNow, let's check if this satisfies equation 3.\n\nCompute Q: ab + bc + ca = 100*100 + 100*100 + 100*100 = 3*10,000 = 30,000.\n\nCompute P: abc = 100*100*100 = 1,000,000.\n\nCheck equation 3: 100Q - P = 100*30,000 - 1,000,000 = 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 2,000,000.
