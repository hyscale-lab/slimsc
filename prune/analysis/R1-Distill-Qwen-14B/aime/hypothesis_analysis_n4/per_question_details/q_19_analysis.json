So, in triangle IOA, angle at I is 90 degrees, so by Pythagoras theorem, IA\u00b2 + OI\u00b2 = OA\u00b2.\n\nBut OA is the circumradius, right? Because O is the circumcenter, so OA = R = 13.\n\nSo, IA\u00b2 + (sqrt(13))\u00b2 = 13\u00b2.\n\nCalculating that: IA\u00b2 + 13 = 169 \u2192 IA\u00b2 = 156 \u2192 IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).\n\nHmm, so IA is 2*sqrt(39).\n\nBut IA is the length of the inradius from vertex A to the incenter I.",
