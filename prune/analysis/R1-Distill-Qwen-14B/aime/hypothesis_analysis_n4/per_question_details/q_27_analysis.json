          "text1": "Wait, the problem says \"when T rests on the inside of S, it is internally tangent.\" So, when T is inside S, the point of tangency is from the inside. So, the sphere is outside, and the torus is inside, touching the sphere internally. So, the sphere is larger, and the torus is just touching the sphere from the inside.\n\nSimilarly, when T rests on the outside of S, it is externally tangent. So, the torus is outside the sphere, and they touch at a single circle. So, the sphere is inside the torus, and they touch externally.\n\nI think that's correct. So, for internal tangency, the sphere is larger, and the torus is inside, touching it along a circle. For external tangency, the sphere is inside the torus, and they touch along another circle.\n\nSo, now I need to find the radii of these circles of tangency, r_i and r_o.\n\nLet me consider the cross-sectional view. Since both the torus and the sphere are symmetrical around the axis, I can model this in 2D first, using circles instead of tori and spheres.\n\nIn 2D, the torus would be a circle of radius 3, centered at a point 6 units away from the origin. So, the center is at (6, 0), radius 3. The sphere in 2D would be a circle of radius 11 centered at the origin.\n\nSo, when the torus (the circle at (6,0) with radius 3) is inside the sphere (circle at origin with radius 11), the point of tangency is where both circles touch. Similarly, when the torus is outside the sphere, meaning the sphere is inside the torus, the point of tangency is where they touch.",
          "text2": "Wait, no. Let me read the problem again. It says, when T rests on the inside of S, it is internally tangent. When it rests on the outside of S, it's externally tangent. So, in the first case, T is inside S, touching it internally; in the second, T is outside S, touching it externally.\n\nSo, in both cases, the sphere is fixed, and the torus can be placed either inside or outside, touching the sphere along a circle. We need to find the radii of these circles, then subtract them.\n\nI think the way to approach this is to model the torus and sphere mathematically and find the points of tangency.\n\nLet me set up a coordinate system. Let's place the center of the sphere at the origin (0,0,0). The torus, when placed inside, will have its center along the z-axis, I suppose.",
