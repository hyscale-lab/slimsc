So yes, for |x| < 1/2, it's a downward V, and for |x| \u2265 1/2, it's upward V.\n\nSo the graph of f(x) is a diamond shape with vertices at (0, 1/2), (1/2, 0), (-1/2, 0).

So the vertex of the inner function |x| - 1/4 is at (0, -1/4). Taking absolute value, it flips to (0, 1/4). So the vertex of g(x) is (0, 1/4). When |x| = 1/4, g(x) = 0.

Outside of that, when |x| >= 1/2, the expression |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2.\n\nSo the graph of f(x) would be a V-shape with the vertex at (0, 1/2), then the arms going down to (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0).

Let's consider that. The inner function is |x|, subtract 1/4, then take absolute value. So when |x| < 1/4, |x| - 1/4 is negative, so g(x) = 1/4 - |x|. When |x| >= 1/4, it's |x| - 1/4.
