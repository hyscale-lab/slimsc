So, for a fixed set of 4 numbers that Jen has, we can compute the probability that a randomly selected 4-number set intersects with Jen's set in at least two numbers, and then compute the probability that it intersects in exactly four numbers.\n\nSo, yes, let's fix Jen's numbers as a specific set of 4. Then, the problem becomes: given that a random 4-number set intersects with Jen's set in at least two numbers, what is the probability that the intersection is exactly four numbers.\n\nSo, in probability terms, given that the intersection size is >=2, what is the probability that the intersection size is exactly 4.\n\nThis is a conditional probability, P(intersection=4 | intersection >=2).

That's the probability that all four numbers in the random draw match Jen's numbers. Since Jen has exactly four numbers, the number of favorable cases is just 1 (only her set). So, P(intersection=4) = 1 / C(10,4).\n\nC(10,4) is 210. So, P(intersection=4) = 1/210.\n\nNow, P(intersection >=2) is the probability that the random draw shares at least two numbers with Jen's set. So, this includes the cases where the intersection is 2, 3, or 4. So, I need to compute the number of such cases.\n\nThe number of ways the random draw can have exactly k numbers in common with Jen's set can be computed using hypergeometric distribution concepts. So, for k=2,3,4.\n\nThe formula for the number of ways is C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k).
