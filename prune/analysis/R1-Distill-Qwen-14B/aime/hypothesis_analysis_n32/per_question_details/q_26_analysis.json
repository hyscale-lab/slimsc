So, 2100-1848=252. So, 2100=308*6 +252. 252=308*(252/308)= 252/308= 9/11. So, 2100=308*(6 + 9/11)=308*(75/11). So, 2100/308=75/11. So, the term is -75/11 t.\n\nPutting all the terms together:\n\nFirst term: 100 - (2350/11)t + (55225/484)t^2\n\nSecond term: +12600/121 t^2\n\nThird term: -100 + (1175/11)t\n\nFourth term: -75/11 t\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nConstant terms: 100 -100 = 0.\n\nt terms: (-2350/11 + 1175/11 -75/11 )t\n\n= [ (-2350 + 1175 -75)/11 ]t\n\n= (-1250)/11 t\n\nt\u00b2 terms: (55225/484 + 12600/121 ) t\u00b2\n\nConvert 12600/121 to 50400/484 by multiplying numerator and denominator by 4.\n\nSo, 55225 +50400 = 105625.

So slope of tangent at B is (-56\u221a14)/311.\n\nSimilarly, the tangent at C is another line. Since C is at (0,0), and the tangent at C is perpendicular to the radius OC. The center O is (5, 5\u221a14/56), so the slope of OC is (5\u221a14/56)/5 = \u221a14/56. Therefore, the slope of the tangent at C is -56/\u221a14. Simplify this: -56/\u221a14 = -56\u221a14/14 = -4\u221a14.\n\nSo the tangent at C is a line passing through (0,0) with slope -4\u221a14.

Simplify further by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: -15/22.\n\nSo x coordinate of D is -15/22.\n\nThen, from equation 1, y = -4\u221a14 x = -4\u221a14*(-15/22) = (60\u221a14)/22 = (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, I need to find point P where line AD intersects the circumcircle again.

So its equation is y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\nSimilarly, the tangent at B is a line with slope (-56\u221a14)/311 passing through point B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5). So its equation is y - 6\u221a14/5 = [ (-56\u221a14)/311 ] (x - 39/5).\n\nNow, point D is the intersection of the two tangents. So we can find D by solving the two equations:\n\n1. y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\n2. y = [ (-56\u221a14)/311 ] (x - 39/5 ) + 6\u221a14/5.\n\nLet me substitute equation 1 into equation 2.\n\n-4\u221a14 x = [ (-56\u221a14)/311 ] (x - 39/5 ) + 6\u221a14/5.\n\nLet me divide both sides by \u221a14 to simplify:\n\n-4x = [ (-56)/311 ] (x - 39/5 ) + 6/5.\n\nMultiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-4x * 311 = -56(x - 39/5) + (6/5)*311.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nLeft side: -1244 x.\n\nRight side: -56x + (56 * 39)/5 + (6 * 311)/5.\n\nCompute 56 * 39: 56*40=2240, minus 56=2184. So 2184/5.\n\n6*311=1866. So 1866/5.\n\nSo right side: -56x + 2184/5 + 1866/5 = -56x + (2184 + 1866)/5 = -56x + 4050/5 = -56x + 810.\n\nSo now equation is:\n\n-1244x = -56x + 810.\n\nBring -56x to the left:\n\n-1244x +56x = 810 \u21d2 (-1188)x = 810 \u21d2 x = 810 / (-1188).\n\nSimplify fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 18: 810 \u00f718=45, 1188 \u00f718=66.\n\nSo x= -45/66. Simplify further by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: -15/22.\n\nSo x coordinate of D is -15/22.\n\nThen, from equation 1, y = -4\u221a14 x = -4\u221a14*(-15/22) = (60\u221a14)/22 = (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, I need to find point P where line AD intersects the circumcircle again. Since A is at (10,0) and D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11), let me find the parametric equation of line AD.\n\nParametrize AD with parameter t. Let me write it as:\n\nx = 10 + t*(-15/22 -10) = 10 + t*(-235/22).\n\ny = 0 + t*(30\u221a14/11 -0) = t*(30\u221a14/11).\n\nSo x = 10 - (235/22)t.\n\ny = (30\u221a14/11) t.\n\nWe need to find the value of t where this parametric line intersects the circumcircle again. Since A is on both the line and the circle, t=0 corresponds to A, and t=T corresponds to P.\n\nPlug x and y into the circle equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + Ey =0.",

So, 30/235=6/47.\n\nSimilarly, 22 and 11: 22/11=2.\n\nSo, m_AD= (30\u221a14 * (-22))/(11*235) = ( (30/235)*(22/11) )*(-\u221a14).\n\nWhich becomes (6/47 * 2)*(-\u221a14)= (12/47)*(-\u221a14)= -12\u221a14/47.\n\nSo, slope m_AD= -12\u221a14/47.\n\nNow, equation of line AD: using point A(10,0):\n\ny -0 = m_AD*(x -10) \u2192 y= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nWe need to find the other intersection point P of line AD with the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nWe already know that A is on \u03c9 and on AD, so P is the other point.\n\nSo, to find P, we can solve the equation of line AD together with the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nFirst, equation of \u03c9: since it's the circumcircle of triangle ABC, and we have three points on it. But since we know the center is O(5,5\u221a14/56), and radius R=75\u221a14/56.\n\nSo, equation of \u03c9 is (x -5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n(x -5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n(75\u221a14)^2 = 75^2 *14=5625*14=78750.\n\nDenominator:56^2=3136.\n\nSo, right side is 78750/3136.\n\nNow, equation of line AD is y= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nLet me substitute this into the equation of \u03c9.\n\nSo, substitute y = (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10) into the circle equation.\n\nLet me denote m = -12\u221a14/47 for simplicity.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(x -5)^2 + (m(x -10) -5\u221a14/56)^2 = 78750/3136.\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\nFirst term: (x -5)^2 = x\u00b2 -10x +25.\n\nSecond term: [ m(x -10) -5\u221a14/56 ]^2.\n\nLet me compute m(x-10):\n\nm(x-10) = (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n(-12\u221a14/47)(x -10) -5\u221a14/56.\n\nLet me factor out \u221a14:\n\n\u221a14 [ (-12/47)(x -10) -5/(56) ].\n\nSo, the square is:\n\n14 * [ (-12/47)(x -10) -5/56 ]^2.\n\nSo, the second term is 14 * [ (-12/47)(x -10) -5/56 ]^2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the equation is:\n\n(x\u00b2 -10x +25) +14*[ (-12/47 (x -10) -5/56 ) ]^2 = 78750/3136.\n\nThis looks a bit messy, but perhaps we can simplify step by step.\n\nLet me denote t = x.\n\nCompute the expression inside the square brackets:\n\n(-12/47)(t -10) -5/56.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nLet me find a common denominator for the coefficients. 47 and 56 are coprime, so the LCD is 47*56=2632.\n\nSo, write each term with denominator 2632.\n\n-12/47 = (-12*56)/2632 = (-672)/2632.\n\n-5/56= (-5*47)/2632 = (-235)/2632.\n\nSo, (-12/47)(t -10) = (-672/2632)(t -10).\n\nSo, the entire expression becomes:\n\n(-672/2632)(t -10) -235/2632 = [ -672(t -10) -235 ] /2632.\n\nSo, the expression is [ -672t +6720 -235 ] /2632 = [ -672t +6485 ] /2632.\n\nTherefore, the second term is 14 * [ (-672t +6485)/2632 ]^2.\n\nWhich is 14*( (-672t +6485)^2 )/(2632^2).\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nt\u00b2 -10t +25 +14*( (-672t +6485)^2 )/(2632\u00b2) = 78750/3136.\n\nThis seems very complicated.

We need to find the equation of line AD, which connects points A(10,0) and D(-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nFirst, compute the slope of AD.\n\nSlope m = (y2 - y1)/(x2 -x1) = (30\u221a14/11 - 0)/( -15/22 -10 )= (30\u221a14/11)/( -15/22 -220/22 )= (30\u221a14/11)/( -235/22 ).\n\nSimplify: 30\u221a14/11 * 22/(-235)= (30\u221a14 *2)/(-235)= (60\u221a14)/(-235)= -60\u221a14/235.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator by 5: 60/5=12, 235/5=47.\n\nSo, slope m= -12\u221a14 /47.\n\nSo, the equation of line AD is y -0 = m(x -10), so y= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nNow, we need to find point P where this line intersects the circumcircle \u03c9 again. We already know that A is on both the line and the circle, so we need the other intersection point P.\n\nThe equation of the circle \u03c9 is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y=0.\n\nAnd the equation of line AD is y= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nLet me substitute y into the circle's equation.\n\nSo, substitute y= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10) into x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y=0.\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst, compute y\u00b2:\n\ny\u00b2= [ (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10) ]^2 = (144*14)/(47\u00b2) * (x -10)^2 = (2016)/(2209)*(x\u00b2 -20x +100).\n\nThen, compute (5\u221a14/28)y:\n\n(5\u221a14/28)*(-12\u221a14/47)(x -10)= (5\u221a14 * -12\u221a14)/(28*47) (x -10).\n\nMultiply the terms:\n\n5*(-12)= -60.\n\n\u221a14*\u221a14=14.\n\n28*47=1316.\n\nSo, this becomes (-60*14)/1316 (x-10)= (-840)/1316 (x-10)= (-210)/329 (x-10).\n\nSimplify: -210 and 329 have a common factor of 7? 210 \u00f77=30, 329 \u00f77=47. So, -30/47 (x -10).\n\nSo, now, substituting into the circle equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + [2016/2209 (x\u00b2 -20x +100)] -10x - [ (-210/329)(x-10) ] =0.",

Since points A(10,0), B(39/5,6\u221a14/5), and C(0,0) lie on it, I can find the equation.\n\nGeneral equation of circle: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx + 2fy + c =0.\n\nSince point C (0,0) is on the circle: 0 +0 +0 +0 +c=0 => c=0.\n\nSo equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx + 2fy =0.\n\nNow, plug in point A(10,0):\n\n10\u00b2 +0 +2g*10 +2f*0=0 => 100 +20g=0 => 20g= -100 => g= -5.\n\nSo, equation now: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + 2fy=0.\n\nNow, plug in point B(39/5,6\u221a14/5):\n\n(39/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 -10*(39/5) +2f*(6\u221a14/5) =0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(39/5)^2 = 1521/25\n\n(6\u221a14/5)^2=36*14/25=504/25\n\n10*(39/5)= 78\n\nSo,\n\n1521/25 +504/25 -78 + (12f\u221a14)/5 =0.\n\nCombine the first two terms:\n\n(1521 +504)/25 =2025/25=81.\n\nSo,\n\n81 -78 + (12f\u221a14)/5 =0\n\nSimplify: 3 + (12f\u221a14)/5=0\n\nSo,\n\n(12f\u221a14)/5 = -3\n\nMultiply both sides by 5:\n\n12f\u221a14= -15\n\nDivide both sides by 12\u221a14:\n\nf= (-15)/(12\u221a14)= (-5)/(4\u221a14). Rationalize denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14:\n\nf= (-5\u221a14)/(4*14)= (-5\u221a14)/56.\n\nSo, f= -5\u221a14/56.\n\nTherefore, the equation of circle \u03c9 is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x +2*(-5\u221a14/56)y=0.\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (10\u221a14/56)y=0.\n\nSimplify 10\u221a14/56: 10/56=5/28, so 5\u221a14/28.\n\nSo, equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y =0.\n\nNow, to find the equation of tangent at point B(39/5,6\u221a14/5). The equation of tangent to a circle at a point (x\u2081,y\u2081) is xx\u2081 + yy\u2081 + g(x +x\u2081) + f(y + y\u2081) + c =0.",
          "text2": "Wait, 504 = 9 * 56 = 9 * 7 * 8 = 9 * 7 * 8. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(9 * 56) = 3*sqrt(56). And sqrt(56) can be sqrt(4*14)=2*sqrt(14). So sqrt(504)=3*2*sqrt(14)=6\u221a14. So y = (6\u221a14)/5.\n\nSo point B is at (39/5, 6\u221a14/5).\n\nNow, I need to find the equations of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nBut first, I need the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9.

Since A is already on the circle, the other intersection is P.\n\nThe equation of the circle \u03c9 is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y = 0.\n\nSubstitute x and y from the parametric equations into the circle's equation.\n\nLet me denote t as a parameter.\n\nSo, substitute:\n\nx = 10 - (235/22)t\n\ny = 0 + (30\u221a14/11)t\n\nPlug into the circle equation:\n\n(10 - (235/22)t)^2 + ( (30\u221a14/11)t )^2 -10*(10 - (235/22)t) - (5\u221a14/28)*(30\u221a14/11)t = 0\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: (10 - (235/22)t)^2\n\n= 100 - 2*10*(235/22)t + (235/22)^2 t^2\n\n= 100 - (4700/22)t + (55225/484)t^2\n\nSimplify:\n\n4700/22 = 2350/11 \u2248 213.636\n\n55225/484 \u2248 114.08\n\nSecond term: ( (30\u221a14/11)t )^2 = (900*14)/(121) t^2 = 12600/121 t^2 \u2248 104.132 t^2\n\nThird term: -10*(10 - (235/22)t) = -100 + (2350/22)t = -100 + (1175/11)t \u2248 -100 + 106.818 t\n\nFourth term: -(5\u221a14/28)*(30\u221a14/11)t = -(5*30*14)/(28*11) t = -(2100)/(308) t = -2100/308 t = Simplify this.\n\n2100 divided by 308: let's see, 308*6=1848, 308*7=2156 which is too much. So, 2100-1848=252. So, 2100=308*6 +252. 252=308*(252/308)= 252/308= 9/11. So, 2100=308*(6 + 9/11)=308*(75/11). So, 2100/308=75/11. So, the term is -75/11 t.\n\nPutting all the terms together:\n\nFirst term: 100 - (2350/11)t + (55225/484)t^2\n\nSecond term: +12600/121 t^2\n\nThird term: -100 + (1175/11)t\n\nFourth term: -75/11 t\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nConstant terms: 100 -100 = 0.\n\nt terms: (-2350/11 + 1175/11 -75/11 )t\n\n= [ (-2350 + 1175 -75)/11 ]t\n\n= (-1250)/11 t\n\nt\u00b2 terms: (55225/484 + 12600/121 ) t\u00b2\n\nConvert 12600/121 to 50400/484 by multiplying numerator and denominator by 4.\n\nSo, 55225 +50400 = 105625.

So,\n\n14*(-\u221a14)y + 311\u221a14 y = 11340\n\nSo, (-14\u221a14 + 311\u221a14)y = 11340\n\nFactor out \u221a14:\n\n( (-14 + 311 )\u221a14 ) y = 11340\n\nCompute -14 +311=297.\n\nSo, 297\u221a14 y = 11340.\n\nThus, y = 11340 / (297\u221a14).\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\n11340 and 297. Let's see, 297 divides by 9: 297/9=33. 11340 /9=1260.\n\nSo, 1260 /33\u221a14.\n\nSimplify 1260 and 33: both divisible by 3.\n\n1260/3=420, 33/3=11.\n\nSo, 420/(11\u221a14).\n\nRationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by \u221a14:\n\n(420\u221a14)/(11*14) = (420\u221a14)/154.\n\nSimplify 420/154: divide numerator and denominator by 14.\n\n420 \u00f714=30, 154 \u00f714=11.\n\nSo, 30\u221a14 /11.\n\nThus, y = 30\u221a14 /11.\n\nThen, x = (-\u221a14 /56)y = (-\u221a14 /56)*(30\u221a14 /11).\n\nMultiply together:\n\n(-\u221a14 *30\u221a14) / (56*11) = (-30*14)/(616).\n\nBecause \u221a14 *\u221a14=14.\n\nSo, numerator is -30*14= -420.\n\nDenominator is 56*11=616.\n\nThus, x= -420/616.\n\nSimplify: both divide by 28. 420/28=15, 616/28=22.\n\nSo, x= -15/22.\n\nSo, point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14 /11).\n\nNow, I need to find point P, which is the intersection of line AD with the circle \u03c9, other than A.\n\nSo, let's find the parametric equation of line AD.\n\nPoint A is at (10,0), and point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14 /11).\n\nSo, the vector from A to D is (-15/22 -10, 30\u221a14/11 -0) = (-15/22 - 220/22, 30\u221a14/11) = (-235/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nSo, parametric equations can be written as:\n\nx = 10 + t*(-235/22)\n\ny = 0 + t*(30\u221a14/11)\n\nWe need to find the point P where this line intersects the circle \u03c9 again. Since A is already on the circle, the other intersection is P.\n\nThe equation of the circle \u03c9 is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y = 0.\n\nSubstitute x and y from the parametric equations into the circle's equation.\n\nLet me denote t as a parameter.\n\nSo, substitute:\n\nx = 10 - (235/22)t\n\ny = 0 + (30\u221a14/11)t\n\nPlug into the circle equation:\n\n(10 - (235/22)t)^2 + ( (30\u221a14/11)t )^2 -10*(10 - (235/22)t) - (5\u221a14/28)*(30\u221a14/11)t = 0\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: (10 - (235/22)t)^2\n\n= 100 - 2*10*(235/22)t + (235/22)^2 t^2\n\n= 100 - (4700/22)t + (55225/484)t^2\n\nSimplify:\n\n4700/22 = 2350/11 \u2248 213.636\n\n55225/484 \u2248 114.08\n\nSecond term: ( (30\u221a14/11)t )^2 = (900*14)/(121) t^2 = 12600/121 t^2 \u2248 104.132 t^2\n\nThird term: -10*(10 - (235/22)t) = -100 + (2350/22)t = -100 + (1175/11)t \u2248 -100 + 106.818 t\n\nFourth term: -(5\u221a14/28)*(30\u221a14/11)t = -(5*30*14)/(28*11) t = -(2100)/(308) t = -2100/308 t = Simplify this.\n\n2100 divided by 308: let's see, 308*6=1848, 308*7=2156 which is too much. So, 2100-1848=252. So, 2100=308*6 +252. 252=308*(252/308)= 252/308= 9/11. So, 2100=308*(6 + 9/11)=308*(75/11). So, 2100/308=75/11. So, the term is -75/11 t.\n\nPutting all the terms together:\n\nFirst term: 100 - (2350/11)t + (55225/484)t^2\n\nSecond term: +12600/121 t^2\n\nThird term: -100 + (1175/11)t\n\nFourth term: -75/11 t\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nConstant terms: 100 -100 = 0.\n\nt terms: (-2350/11 + 1175/11 -75/11 )t\n\n= [ (-2350 + 1175 -75)/11 ]t\n\n= (-1250)/11 t\n\nt\u00b2 terms: (55225/484 + 12600/121 ) t\u00b2\n\nConvert 12600/121 to 50400/484 by multiplying numerator and denominator by 4.\n\nSo, 55225 +50400 = 105625. So, 105625/484 t\u00b2.\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\n105625/484 t\u00b2 -1250/11 t = 0.\n\nFactor out t:\n\nt*(105625/484 t -1250/11) = 0.\n\nSo, solutions are t=0, which corresponds to point A, and the other solution is:\n\n105625/484 t -1250/11 =0\n\nSolving for t:\n\n105625/484 t = 1250/11\n\nt = (1250/11) * (484/105625)\n\nSimplify fractions.\n\nFirst, 1250 and 105625: 105625 \u00f71250 = 84.5.

Divide by 2: 89/10 = 8.9.\n\nSimilarly, the y-coordinate: 6\u221a14/5 divided by 2 is 3\u221a14/5.\n\nSo, M1 is at (89/10, 3\u221a14/5).\n\nNow, the slope of AB: (yB - yA)/(xB - xA) = (6\u221a14/5 - 0)/(39/5 - 10).\n\nCompute denominator: 39/5 - 50/5 = (-11/5).\n\nSo, slope of AB: (6\u221a14/5) / (-11/5) = (6\u221a14)/(-11) = -6\u221a14/11.\n\nTherefore, the perpendicular bisector of AB will have slope reciprocal and opposite sign: 11/(6\u221a14). Let's rationalize that: 11\u221a14/(6*14) = 11\u221a14/84.",

The general equation of a circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0.\n\nPlugging in point C(0,0): 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0 => F=0.\n\nSo, equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey = 0.\n\nPlug in point A(10,0): 100 + 0 + 10D + 0 = 0 => 10D = -100 => D = -10.\n\nNow, plug in point B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5):\n\n(39/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 + D*(39/5) + E*(6\u221a14/5) = 0.\n\nWe know D = -10, so:\n\n(1521/25) + (36*14)/25 + (-10)*(39/5) + E*(6\u221a14/5) = 0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1521/25 = 60.84\n\n36*14 = 504, so 504/25 = 20.16\n\n-10*(39/5) = -78\n\nSo, adding the first three terms: 60.84 + 20.16 -78 = (81) -78 = 3.\n\nSo, 3 + (E * 6\u221a14)/5 = 0 => (6\u221a14 E)/5 = -3 => E = (-3 *5)/(6\u221a14) = (-15)/(6\u221a14) = (-5)/(2\u221a14).\n\nRationalizing the denominator: (-5\u221a14)/(2*14) = (-5\u221a14)/28.\n\nSo, E = (-5\u221a14)/28.\n\nSo, the equation of the circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y = 0.\n\nNow, to find the tangent at point B. The equation of the tangent to a circle at a point (x\u2081,y\u2081) is given by:\n\nxx\u2081 + yy\u2081 + D*(x + x\u2081)/2 + E*(y + y\u2081)/2 + F = 0.",

So that's correct.\n\nNow, back to the problem. We need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C.\n\nSince we have the coordinates of O, and points B and C, we can find the equations of the tangents at B and C, then find their intersection point D.\n\nTangent at B:\n\nThe tangent at B is perpendicular to the radius OB. The slope of OB is (y_B - y_O)/(x_B - x_O).\n\nPoint B is (39/5, 6\u221a14/5), point O is (5, 5\u221a14/56).\n\nCompute slope of OB:\n\n(6\u221a14/5 - 5\u221a14/56) / (39/5 -5) = (6\u221a14/5 - 5\u221a14/56) / (39/5 -25/5) = (6\u221a14/5 -5\u221a14/56) / (14/5).\n\nFirst, compute numerator:\n\n6\u221a14/5 = (6\u221a14 * 56)/(5*56) = 336\u221a14/(280)\n\n5\u221a14/56 = (5\u221a14 *5)/(56*5)= 25\u221a14/(280)\n\nSo, numerator: 336\u221a14/280 -25\u221a14/280 = (336 -25)\u221a14 /280 = 311\u221a14 /280.\n\nSo, slope of OB is (311\u221a14 /280) divided by (14/5) = (311\u221a14 /280) * (5/14) = (311\u221a14 *5)/(280*14) = (1555\u221a14)/(3920) = (311\u221a14)/784.\n\nSo, the slope of tangent at B is the negative reciprocal of this slope.\n\nSo, slope of tangent at B: m_B = -784/(311\u221a14).\n\nSimilarly, let me rationalize that:\n\nm_B = -784/(311\u221a14) = (-784\u221a14)/(311*14) = (-56\u221a14)/311.",
          "text2": "Wait, no, slope of tangent is negative reciprocal of slope of OB.\n\nSo slope of OB is (y_B - y_O)/(x_B - x_O) = [ (6\u221a14/5 - 5\u221a14/56) ] / (39/5 -5) = as I computed earlier, (311\u221a14/280)/(14/5) )= (311\u221a14/280) * (5/14) )= 311\u221a14/(280*14/5) )= 311\u221a14/( (280/5)*14 )= 311\u221a14/(56*14)= 311\u221a14/(784).\n\nSo slope of tangent is -784/(311\u221a14). Rationalizing, multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14:\n\n-784\u221a14/(311*14) = (-784/14)*\u221a14/311 = (-56)*\u221a14/311. So slope of tangent at B is (-56\u221a14)/311.\n\nSimilarly, the tangent at C is another line. Since C is at (0,0), and the tangent at C is perpendicular to the radius OC. The center O is (5, 5\u221a14/56), so the slope of OC is (5\u221a14/56)/5 = \u221a14/56. Therefore, the slope of the tangent at C is -56/\u221a14. Simplify this: -56/\u221a14 = -56\u221a14/14 = -4\u221a14.\n\nSo the tangent at C is a line passing through (0,0) with slope -4\u221a14. So its equation is y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\nSimilarly, the tangent at B is a line with slope (-56\u221a14)/311 passing through point B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5). So its equation is y - 6\u221a14/5 = [ (-56\u221a14)/311 ] (x - 39/5).\n\nNow, point D is the intersection of the two tangents. So we can find D by solving the two equations:\n\n1. y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\n2. y = [ (-56\u221a14)/311 ] (x - 39/5 ) + 6\u221a14/5.\n\nLet me substitute equation 1 into equation 2.\n\n-4\u221a14 x = [ (-56\u221a14)/311 ] (x - 39/5 ) + 6\u221a14/5.\n\nLet me divide both sides by \u221a14 to simplify:\n\n-4x = [ (-56)/311 ] (x - 39/5 ) + 6/5.\n\nMultiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-4x * 311 = -56(x - 39/5) + (6/5)*311.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nLeft side: -1244 x.\n\nRight side: -56x + (56 * 39)/5 + (6 * 311)/5.\n\nCompute 56 * 39: 56*40=2240, minus 56=2184. So 2184/5.\n\n6*311=1866. So 1866/5.\n\nSo right side: -56x + 2184/5 + 1866/5 = -56x + (2184 + 1866)/5 = -56x + 4050/5 = -56x + 810.\n\nSo now equation is:\n\n-1244x = -56x + 810.\n\nBring -56x to the left:\n\n-1244x +56x = 810 \u21d2 (-1188)x = 810 \u21d2 x = 810 / (-1188).\n\nSimplify fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 18: 810 \u00f718=45, 1188 \u00f718=66.\n\nSo x= -45/66. Simplify further by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: -15/22.\n\nSo x coordinate of D is -15/22.\n\nThen, from equation 1, y = -4\u221a14 x = -4\u221a14*(-15/22) = (60\u221a14)/22 = (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, I need to find point P where line AD intersects the circumcircle again. Since A is at (10,0) and D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11), let me find the parametric equation of line AD.\n\nParametrize AD with parameter t. Let me write it as:\n\nx = 10 + t*(-15/22 -10) = 10 + t*(-235/22).\n\ny = 0 + t*(30\u221a14/11 -0) = t*(30\u221a14/11).\n\nSo x = 10 - (235/22)t.\n\ny = (30\u221a14/11) t.\n\nWe need to find the value of t where this parametric line intersects the circumcircle again. Since A is on both the line and the circle, t=0 corresponds to A, and t=T corresponds to P.\n\nPlug x and y into the circle equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + Ey =0.",

Rationalizing, multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14:\n\n-784\u221a14/(311*14) = (-784/14)*\u221a14/311 = (-56)*\u221a14/311.

The center O is (5, 5\u221a14/56), so the slope of OC is (5\u221a14/56)/5 = \u221a14/56. Therefore, the slope of the tangent at C is -56/\u221a14. Simplify this: -56/\u221a14 = -56\u221a14/14 = -4\u221a14.\n\nSo the tangent at C is a line passing through (0,0) with slope -4\u221a14.

So 2184/5.\n\n6*311=1866. So 1866/5.\n\nSo right side: -56x + 2184/5 + 1866/5 = -56x + (2184 + 1866)/5 = -56x + 4050/5 = -56x + 810.\n\nSo now equation is:\n\n-1244x = -56x + 810.\n\nBring -56x to the left:\n\n-1244x +56x = 810 \u21d2 (-1188)x = 810 \u21d2 x = 810 / (-1188).\n\nSimplify fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 18: 810 \u00f718=45, 1188 \u00f718=66.\n\nSo x= -45/66. Simplify further by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: -15/22.\n\nSo x coordinate of D is -15/22.\n\nThen, from equation 1, y = -4\u221a14 x = -4\u221a14*(-15/22) = (60\u221a14)/22 = (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, I need to find point P where line AD intersects the circumcircle again.

So, the slope of OC is (5\u221a14/56 -0)/(5-0)= (5\u221a14/56)/5=\u221a14/56.\n\nSo, the slope of OC is \u221a14/56. Therefore, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: -56/\u221a14= -56\u221a14/14= -4\u221a14.\n\nSo, the tangent at C has slope -4\u221a14 and passes through C(0,0).

But since we know the center is O(5,5\u221a14/56), and radius R=75\u221a14/56.\n\nSo, equation of \u03c9 is (x -5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n(x -5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n(75\u221a14)^2 = 75^2 *14=5625*14=78750.\n\nDenominator:56^2=3136.\n\nSo, right side is 78750/3136.\n\nNow, equation of line AD is y= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nLet me substitute this into the equation of \u03c9.\n\nSo, substitute y = (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10) into the circle equation.\n\nLet me denote m = -12\u221a14/47 for simplicity.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(x -5)^2 + (m(x -10) -5\u221a14/56)^2 = 78750/3136.\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\nFirst term: (x -5)^2 = x\u00b2 -10x +25.\n\nSecond term: [ m(x -10) -5\u221a14/56 ]^2.\n\nLet me compute m(x-10):\n\nm(x-10) = (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n(-12\u221a14/47)(x -10) -5\u221a14/56.\n\nLet me factor out \u221a14:\n\n\u221a14 [ (-12/47)(x -10) -5/(56) ].\n\nSo, the square is:\n\n14 * [ (-12/47)(x -10) -5/56 ]^2.\n\nSo, the second term is 14 * [ (-12/47)(x -10) -5/56 ]^2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the equation is:\n\n(x\u00b2 -10x +25) +14*[ (-12/47 (x -10) -5/56 ) ]^2 = 78750/3136.\n\nThis looks a bit messy, but perhaps we can simplify step by step.\n\nLet me denote t = x.\n\nCompute the expression inside the square brackets:\n\n(-12/47)(t -10) -5/56.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nLet me find a common denominator for the coefficients. 47 and 56 are coprime, so the LCD is 47*56=2632.\n\nSo, write each term with denominator 2632.\n\n-12/47 = (-12*56)/2632 = (-672)/2632.\n\n-5/56= (-5*47)/2632 = (-235)/2632.\n\nSo, (-12/47)(t -10) = (-672/2632)(t -10).\n\nSo, the entire expression becomes:\n\n(-672/2632)(t -10) -235/2632 = [ -672(t -10) -235 ] /2632.\n\nSo, the expression is [ -672t +6720 -235 ] /2632 = [ -672t +6485 ] /2632.\n\nTherefore, the second term is 14 * [ (-672t +6485)/2632 ]^2.\n\nWhich is 14*( (-672t +6485)^2 )/(2632^2).\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nt\u00b2 -10t +25 +14*( (-672t +6485)^2 )/(2632\u00b2) = 78750/3136.\n\nThis seems very complicated.

The slope of AB is (yB - yA)/(xB - xA) = (6\u221a14/5 - 0)/(39/5 - 10) = (6\u221a14/5)/( -11/5) = -6\u221a14/11.\n\nSo, the perpendicular bisector will have a slope that's the negative reciprocal, which is 11/(6\u221a14).\n\nSo, equation of the perpendicular bisector of AB: passing through M (89/10, 3\u221a14/5) with slope 11/(6\u221a14).\n\nPoint-slope form: y - 3\u221a14/5 = (11/(6\u221a14))(x - 89/10)\n\nSimilarly, for AC: the midpoint is N (5,0). The slope of AC is (0 - 0)/(10 - 0) = 0. So, the perpendicular bisector is vertical.",

We already know that A is on both the line and the circle, so we need the other intersection point P.\n\nThe equation of the circle \u03c9 is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y=0.\n\nAnd the equation of line AD is y= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nLet me substitute y into the circle's equation.\n\nSo, substitute y= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10) into x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y=0.\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst, compute y\u00b2:\n\ny\u00b2= [ (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10) ]^2 = (144*14)/(47\u00b2) * (x -10)^2 = (2016)/(2209)*(x\u00b2 -20x +100).\n\nThen, compute (5\u221a14/28)y:\n\n(5\u221a14/28)*(-12\u221a14/47)(x -10)= (5\u221a14 * -12\u221a14)/(28*47) (x -10).\n\nMultiply the terms:\n\n5*(-12)= -60.\n\n\u221a14*\u221a14=14.\n\n28*47=1316.\n\nSo, this becomes (-60*14)/1316 (x-10)= (-840)/1316 (x-10)= (-210)/329 (x-10).\n\nSimplify: -210 and 329 have a common factor of 7? 210 \u00f77=30, 329 \u00f77=47. So, -30/47 (x -10).\n\nSo, now, substituting into the circle equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + [2016/2209 (x\u00b2 -20x +100)] -10x - [ (-210/329)(x-10) ] =0.",

Since A is already on the circle, the other intersection is P.\n\nThe equation of the circle \u03c9 is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y = 0.\n\nSubstitute x and y from the parametric equations into the circle's equation.\n\nLet me denote t as a parameter.\n\nSo, substitute:\n\nx = 10 - (235/22)t\n\ny = 0 + (30\u221a14/11)t\n\nPlug into the circle equation:\n\n(10 - (235/22)t)^2 + ( (30\u221a14/11)t )^2 -10*(10 - (235/22)t) - (5\u221a14/28)*(30\u221a14/11)t = 0\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: (10 - (235/22)t)^2\n\n= 100 - 2*10*(235/22)t + (235/22)^2 t^2\n\n= 100 - (4700/22)t + (55225/484)t^2\n\nSimplify:\n\n4700/22 = 2350/11 \u2248 213.636\n\n55225/484 \u2248 114.08\n\nSecond term: ( (30\u221a14/11)t )^2 = (900*14)/(121) t^2 = 12600/121 t^2 \u2248 104.132 t^2\n\nThird term: -10*(10 - (235/22)t) = -100 + (2350/22)t = -100 + (1175/11)t \u2248 -100 + 106.818 t\n\nFourth term: -(5\u221a14/28)*(30\u221a14/11)t = -(5*30*14)/(28*11) t = -(2100)/(308) t = -2100/308 t = Simplify this.\n\n2100 divided by 308: let's see, 308*6=1848, 308*7=2156 which is too much. So, 2100-1848=252. So, 2100=308*6 +252. 252=308*(252/308)= 252/308= 9/11. So, 2100=308*(6 + 9/11)=308*(75/11). So, 2100/308=75/11.

So, equation is y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\nSimilarly, tangent at B: point B is (39/5, 6\u221a14/5), slope m_B = -56\u221a14/311.\n\nEquation: y - 6\u221a14/5 = m_B (x - 39/5).\n\nSo,\n\ny = (-56\u221a14/311)(x - 39/5) + 6\u221a14/5.\n\nNow, to find point D, which is the intersection of these two tangents.\n\nSo, set the two equations equal:\n\n-4\u221a14 x = (-56\u221a14/311)(x - 39/5) + 6\u221a14/5.\n\nLet me divide both sides by \u221a14 to simplify:\n\n-4x = (-56/311)(x -39/5) +6/5.\n\nMultiply through by 311 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-4x *311 = -56(x -39/5) +6/5 *311.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-4*311 x = -1244x.\n\n-56(x -39/5) = -56x + (56*39)/5 = -56x + 2208/5.\n\n6/5 *311 = 1866/5.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n-1244x = (-56x + 2208/5) + 1866/5.\n\nCombine constants on the right:\n\n2208/5 +1866/5 = (2208 +1866)/5 = 4074/5.\n\nSo,\n\n-1244x = -56x + 4074/5.\n\nBring terms with x to the left:\n\n-1244x +56x =4074/5.\n\n-1188x =4074/5.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n1188x = -4074/5.\n\nx = (-4074)/(5*1188).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n4074 and 1188: let's see, 4074 divided by 6 is 679, 1188 divided by 6 is 198.\n\nSo, x= (-679)/(5*198) = (-679)/990.",

So,\n\n14*(-\u221a14)y + 311\u221a14 y = 11340\n\nSo, (-14\u221a14 + 311\u221a14)y = 11340\n\nFactor out \u221a14:\n\n( (-14 + 311 )\u221a14 ) y = 11340\n\nCompute -14 +311=297.\n\nSo, 297\u221a14 y = 11340.\n\nThus, y = 11340 / (297\u221a14).\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\n11340 and 297. Let's see, 297 divides by 9: 297/9=33. 11340 /9=1260.\n\nSo, 1260 /33\u221a14.\n\nSimplify 1260 and 33: both divisible by 3.\n\n1260/3=420, 33/3=11.\n\nSo, 420/(11\u221a14).\n\nRationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by \u221a14:\n\n(420\u221a14)/(11*14) = (420\u221a14)/154.\n\nSimplify 420/154: divide numerator and denominator by 14.\n\n420 \u00f714=30, 154 \u00f714=11.\n\nSo, 30\u221a14 /11.\n\nThus, y = 30\u221a14 /11.\n\nThen, x = (-\u221a14 /56)y = (-\u221a14 /56)*(30\u221a14 /11).\n\nMultiply together:\n\n(-\u221a14 *30\u221a14) / (56*11) = (-30*14)/(616).\n\nBecause \u221a14 *\u221a14=14.\n\nSo, numerator is -30*14= -420.\n\nDenominator is 56*11=616.\n\nThus, x= -420/616.\n\nSimplify: both divide by 28. 420/28=15, 616/28=22.\n\nSo, x= -15/22.\n\nSo, point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14 /11).\n\nNow, I need to find point P, which is the intersection of line AD with the circle \u03c9, other than A.\n\nSo, let's find the parametric equation of line AD.\n\nPoint A is at (10,0), and point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14 /11).\n\nSo, the vector from A to D is (-15/22 -10, 30\u221a14/11 -0) = (-15/22 - 220/22, 30\u221a14/11) = (-235/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nSo, parametric equations can be written as:\n\nx = 10 + t*(-235/22)\n\ny = 0 + t*(30\u221a14/11)\n\nWe need to find the point P where this line intersects the circle \u03c9 again. Since A is already on the circle, the other intersection is P.\n\nThe equation of the circle \u03c9 is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y = 0.\n\nSubstitute x and y from the parametric equations into the circle's equation.\n\nLet me denote t as a parameter.\n\nSo, substitute:\n\nx = 10 - (235/22)t\n\ny = 0 + (30\u221a14/11)t\n\nPlug into the circle equation:\n\n(10 - (235/22)t)^2 + ( (30\u221a14/11)t )^2 -10*(10 - (235/22)t) - (5\u221a14/28)*(30\u221a14/11)t = 0\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: (10 - (235/22)t)^2\n\n= 100 - 2*10*(235/22)t + (235/22)^2 t^2\n\n= 100 - (4700/22)t + (55225/484)t^2\n\nSimplify:\n\n4700/22 = 2350/11 \u2248 213.636\n\n55225/484 \u2248 114.08\n\nSecond term: ( (30\u221a14/11)t )^2 = (900*14)/(121) t^2 = 12600/121 t^2 \u2248 104.132 t^2\n\nThird term: -10*(10 - (235/22)t) = -100 + (2350/22)t = -100 + (1175/11)t \u2248 -100 + 106.818 t\n\nFourth term: -(5\u221a14/28)*(30\u221a14/11)t = -(5*30*14)/(28*11) t = -(2100)/(308) t = -2100/308 t = Simplify this.\n\n2100 divided by 308: let's see, 308*6=1848, 308*7=2156 which is too much. So, 2100-1848=252. So, 2100=308*6 +252. 252=308*(252/308)= 252/308= 9/11. So, 2100=308*(6 + 9/11)=308*(75/11). So, 2100/308=75/11. So, the term is -75/11 t.\n\nPutting all the terms together:\n\nFirst term: 100 - (2350/11)t + (55225/484)t^2\n\nSecond term: +12600/121 t^2\n\nThird term: -100 + (1175/11)t\n\nFourth term: -75/11 t\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nConstant terms: 100 -100 = 0.\n\nt terms: (-2350/11 + 1175/11 -75/11 )t\n\n= [ (-2350 + 1175 -75)/11 ]t\n\n= (-1250)/11 t\n\nt\u00b2 terms: (55225/484 + 12600/121 ) t\u00b2\n\nConvert 12600/121 to 50400/484 by multiplying numerator and denominator by 4.\n\nSo, 55225 +50400 = 105625. So, 105625/484 t\u00b2.\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\n105625/484 t\u00b2 -1250/11 t = 0.\n\nFactor out t:\n\nt*(105625/484 t -1250/11) = 0.\n\nSo, solutions are t=0, which corresponds to point A, and the other solution is:\n\n105625/484 t -1250/11 =0\n\nSolving for t:\n\n105625/484 t = 1250/11\n\nt = (1250/11) * (484/105625)\n\nSimplify fractions.\n\nFirst, 1250 and 105625: 105625 \u00f71250 = 84.5.

Divide by 2: 89/10 = 8.9.\n\nSimilarly, the y-coordinate: 6\u221a14/5 divided by 2 is 3\u221a14/5.\n\nSo, M1 is at (89/10, 3\u221a14/5).\n\nNow, the slope of AB: (yB - yA)/(xB - xA) = (6\u221a14/5 - 0)/(39/5 - 10).\n\nCompute denominator: 39/5 - 50/5 = (-11/5).\n\nSo, slope of AB: (6\u221a14/5) / (-11/5) = (6\u221a14)/(-11) = -6\u221a14/11.\n\nTherefore, the perpendicular bisector of AB will have slope reciprocal and opposite sign: 11/(6\u221a14). Let's rationalize that: 11\u221a14/(6*14) = 11\u221a14/84.",

The center O is (5, 5\u221a14/56), so the slope of OC is (5\u221a14/56)/5 = \u221a14/56. Therefore, the slope of the tangent at C is -56/\u221a14.

So that's correct.\n\nNow, back to the problem. We need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C.\n\nSince we have the coordinates of O, and points B and C, we can find the equations of the tangents at B and C, then find their intersection point D.\n\nTangent at B:\n\nThe tangent at B is perpendicular to the radius OB.

          "text2": "Wait, no, slope of tangent is negative reciprocal of slope of OB.\n\nSo slope of OB is (y_B - y_O)/(x_B - x_O) = [ (6\u221a14/5 - 5\u221a14/56) ] / (39/5 -5) = as I computed earlier, (311\u221a14/280)/(14/5) )= (311\u221a14/280) * (5/14) )= 311\u221a14/(280*14/5) )= 311\u221a14/( (280/5)*14 )= 311\u221a14/(56*14)= 311\u221a14/(784).\n\nSo slope of tangent is -784/(311\u221a14). Rationalizing, multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14:\n\n-784\u221a14/(311*14) = (-784/14)*\u221a14/311 = (-56)*\u221a14/311. So slope of tangent at B is (-56\u221a14)/311.\n\nSimilarly, the tangent at C is another line. Since C is at (0,0), and the tangent at C is perpendicular to the radius OC. The center O is (5, 5\u221a14/56), so the slope of OC is (5\u221a14/56)/5 = \u221a14/56. Therefore, the slope of the tangent at C is -56/\u221a14. Simplify this: -56/\u221a14 = -56\u221a14/14 = -4\u221a14.\n\nSo the tangent at C is a line passing through (0,0) with slope -4\u221a14. So its equation is y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\nSimilarly, the tangent at B is a line with slope (-56\u221a14)/311 passing through point B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5). So its equation is y - 6\u221a14/5 = [ (-56\u221a14)/311 ] (x - 39/5).\n\nNow, point D is the intersection of the two tangents. So we can find D by solving the two equations:\n\n1. y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\n2. y = [ (-56\u221a14)/311 ] (x - 39/5 ) + 6\u221a14/5.\n\nLet me substitute equation 1 into equation 2.\n\n-4\u221a14 x = [ (-56\u221a14)/311 ] (x - 39/5 ) + 6\u221a14/5.\n\nLet me divide both sides by \u221a14 to simplify:\n\n-4x = [ (-56)/311 ] (x - 39/5 ) + 6/5.\n\nMultiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-4x * 311 = -56(x - 39/5) + (6/5)*311.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nLeft side: -1244 x.\n\nRight side: -56x + (56 * 39)/5 + (6 * 311)/5.\n\nCompute 56 * 39: 56*40=2240, minus 56=2184. So 2184/5.\n\n6*311=1866. So 1866/5.\n\nSo right side: -56x + 2184/5 + 1866/5 = -56x + (2184 + 1866)/5 = -56x + 4050/5 = -56x + 810.\n\nSo now equation is:\n\n-1244x = -56x + 810.\n\nBring -56x to the left:\n\n-1244x +56x = 810 \u21d2 (-1188)x = 810 \u21d2 x = 810 / (-1188).\n\nSimplify fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 18: 810 \u00f718=45, 1188 \u00f718=66.\n\nSo x= -45/66. Simplify further by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: -15/22.\n\nSo x coordinate of D is -15/22.\n\nThen, from equation 1, y = -4\u221a14 x = -4\u221a14*(-15/22) = (60\u221a14)/22 = (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, I need to find point P where line AD intersects the circumcircle again. Since A is at (10,0) and D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11), let me find the parametric equation of line AD.\n\nParametrize AD with parameter t. Let me write it as:\n\nx = 10 + t*(-15/22 -10) = 10 + t*(-235/22).\n\ny = 0 + t*(30\u221a14/11 -0) = t*(30\u221a14/11).\n\nSo x = 10 - (235/22)t.\n\ny = (30\u221a14/11) t.\n\nWe need to find the value of t where this parametric line intersects the circumcircle again. Since A is on both the line and the circle, t=0 corresponds to A, and t=T corresponds to P.\n\nPlug x and y into the circle equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + Ey =0.",

Then, AB = 5, which is the distance from (10,0) to (x,y):\n\n\u221a[(x -10)^2 + y^2] = 5 \u2192 (x-10)^2 + y^2 = 25.\n\nAnd BC = 9, which is the distance from (0,0) to (x,y):\n\n\u221a[x^2 + y^2] = 9 \u2192 x^2 + y^2 = 81.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. (x -10)^2 + y^2 = 25\n2. x^2 + y^2 = 81\n\nSubtract equation 2 from equation 1:\n\n(x -10)^2 + y^2 - x^2 - y^2 = 25 -81 \u2192 (x\u00b2 -20x +100) - x\u00b2 = -56 \u2192 -20x +100 = -56 \u2192 -20x = -156 \u2192 x = 156 /20 = 39/5 = 7.8.\n\nSo, x = 7.8, which is 39/5. Then, plug back into equation 2 to find y:\n\n(39/5)^2 + y^2 =81 \u2192 (1521/25) + y^2 =81 \u2192 y^2 =81 - 1521/25 = (2025 -1521)/25 = 504/25 \u2192 y= sqrt(504)/5 = (6\u221a14)/5.\n\nSo, point B is at (39/5, 6\u221a14/5). Okay, now I have coordinates for A(10,0), B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5), C(0,0).\n\nNow, let's find the equations for the tangents at B and C. Tangent at B and tangent at C intersect at D.\n\nTo find the tangent to a circle at a point, we can use the formula that the tangent is perpendicular to the radius at that point.\n\nBut first, we need the center of the circle \u03c9, which is the circumcircle of triangle ABC.\n\nWe can find the circumcenter O by finding the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC.\n\nBut since we have coordinates for A, B, and C, perhaps we can compute O.",

Rationalizing, multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14:\n\n-784\u221a14/(311*14) = (-784/14)*\u221a14/311 = (-56)*\u221a14/311. So slope of tangent at B is (-56\u221a14)/311.\n\nSimilarly, the tangent at C is another line. Since C is at (0,0), and the tangent at C is perpendicular to the radius OC. The center O is (5, 5\u221a14/56), so the slope of OC is (5\u221a14/56)/5 = \u221a14/56. Therefore, the slope of the tangent at C is -56/\u221a14. Simplify this: -56/\u221a14 = -56\u221a14/14 = -4\u221a14.\n\nSo the tangent at C is a line passing through (0,0) with slope -4\u221a14. So its equation is y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\nSimilarly, the tangent at B is a line with slope (-56\u221a14)/311 passing through point B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5). So its equation is y - 6\u221a14/5 = [ (-56\u221a14)/311 ] (x - 39/5).\n\nNow, point D is the intersection of the two tangents.

So 2184/5.\n\n6*311=1866. So 1866/5.\n\nSo right side: -56x + 2184/5 + 1866/5 = -56x + (2184 + 1866)/5 = -56x + 4050/5 = -56x + 810.\n\nSo now equation is:\n\n-1244x = -56x + 810.\n\nBring -56x to the left:\n\n-1244x +56x = 810 \u21d2 (-1188)x = 810 \u21d2 x = 810 / (-1188).\n\nSimplify fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 18: 810 \u00f718=45, 1188 \u00f718=66.\n\nSo x= -45/66. Simplify further by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: -15/22.\n\nSo x coordinate of D is -15/22.\n\nThen, from equation 1, y = -4\u221a14 x = -4\u221a14*(-15/22) = (60\u221a14)/22 = (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, I need to find point P where line AD intersects the circumcircle again. Since A is at (10,0) and D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11), let me find the parametric equation of line AD.\n\nParametrize AD with parameter t.

So O is at (5,5\u221a14/56).\n\nNow, the tangent at C is a line perpendicular to the radius OC. Since C is at (0,0), the radius OC is the line from O(5,5\u221a14/56) to C(0,0). So, the slope of OC is (5\u221a14/56 -0)/(5-0)= (5\u221a14/56)/5=\u221a14/56.\n\nSo, the slope of OC is \u221a14/56. Therefore, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: -56/\u221a14= -56\u221a14/14= -4\u221a14.\n\nSo, the tangent at C has slope -4\u221a14 and passes through C(0,0). So, its equation is y= -4\u221a14 x.\n\nSimilarly, the tangent at B: Let's compute its equation. The radius OB has slope (y_B - y_O)/(x_B - x_O).

The center O is (5, 5\u221a14/56), so the slope of OC is (5\u221a14/56)/5 = \u221a14/56. Therefore, the slope of the tangent at C is -56/\u221a14.

So 2184/5.\n\n6*311=1866.

Simplify further by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: -15/22.\n\nSo x coordinate of D is -15/22.\n\nThen, from equation 1, y = -4\u221a14 x = -4\u221a14*(-15/22) = (60\u221a14)/22 = (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, I need to find point P where line AD intersects the circumcircle again. Since A is at (10,0) and D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11), let me find the parametric equation of line AD.\n\nParametrize AD with parameter t.

Now, we need to find the equation of line AD, then find its intersection with the circumcircle \u03c9, which is point P.\n\nPoint A is at (10,0), and point D is at (-15/22,30\u221a14/11). Let's compute the equation of line AD.\n\nFirst, find the slope of AD.\n\nSlope m_AD= (y_D - y_A)/(x_D - x_A) = (30\u221a14/11 -0)/( -15/22 -10 ).\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n-15/22 -10 = -15/22 -220/22 = (-235)/22.\n\nSo, slope m_AD= (30\u221a14/11)/(-235/22)= (30\u221a14/11)*( -22/235 )= (30\u221a14 * (-22))/(11*235).\n\nSimplify:\n\n30 and 235: 235=5*47, 30=5*6. So, 30/235=6/47.\n\nSimilarly, 22 and 11: 22/11=2.\n\nSo, m_AD= (30\u221a14 * (-22))/(11*235) = ( (30/235)*(22/11) )*(-\u221a14).\n\nWhich becomes (6/47 * 2)*(-\u221a14)= (12/47)*(-\u221a14)= -12\u221a14/47.\n\nSo, slope m_AD= -12\u221a14/47.\n\nNow, equation of line AD: using point A(10,0):\n\ny -0 = m_AD*(x -10) \u2192 y= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nWe need to find the other intersection point P of line AD with the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nWe already know that A is on \u03c9 and on AD, so P is the other point.\n\nSo, to find P, we can solve the equation of line AD together with the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nFirst, equation of \u03c9: since it's the circumcircle of triangle ABC, and we have three points on it. But since we know the center is O(5,5\u221a14/56), and radius R=75\u221a14/56.\n\nSo, equation of \u03c9 is (x -5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n(x -5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n(75\u221a14)^2 = 75^2 *14=5625*14=78750.\n\nDenominator:56^2=3136.\n\nSo, right side is 78750/3136.\n\nNow, equation of line AD is y= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nLet me substitute this into the equation of \u03c9.\n\nSo, substitute y = (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10) into the circle equation.\n\nLet me denote m = -12\u221a14/47 for simplicity.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(x -5)^2 + (m(x -10) -5\u221a14/56)^2 = 78750/3136.\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\nFirst term: (x -5)^2 = x\u00b2 -10x +25.\n\nSecond term: [ m(x -10) -5\u221a14/56 ]^2.\n\nLet me compute m(x-10):\n\nm(x-10) = (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n(-12\u221a14/47)(x -10) -5\u221a14/56.\n\nLet me factor out \u221a14:\n\n\u221a14 [ (-12/47)(x -10) -5/(56) ].\n\nSo, the square is:\n\n14 * [ (-12/47)(x -10) -5/56 ]^2.\n\nSo, the second term is 14 * [ (-12/47)(x -10) -5/56 ]^2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the equation is:\n\n(x\u00b2 -10x +25) +14*[ (-12/47 (x -10) -5/56 ) ]^2 = 78750/3136.\n\nThis looks a bit messy, but perhaps we can simplify step by step.\n\nLet me denote t = x.\n\nCompute the expression inside the square brackets:\n\n(-12/47)(t -10) -5/56.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nLet me find a common denominator for the coefficients. 47 and 56 are coprime, so the LCD is 47*56=2632.\n\nSo, write each term with denominator 2632.\n\n-12/47 = (-12*56)/2632 = (-672)/2632.\n\n-5/56= (-5*47)/2632 = (-235)/2632.\n\nSo, (-12/47)(t -10) = (-672/2632)(t -10).\n\nSo, the entire expression becomes:\n\n(-672/2632)(t -10) -235/2632 = [ -672(t -10) -235 ] /2632.\n\nSo, the expression is [ -672t +6720 -235 ] /2632 = [ -672t +6485 ] /2632.\n\nTherefore, the second term is 14 * [ (-672t +6485)/2632 ]^2.\n\nWhich is 14*( (-672t +6485)^2 )/(2632^2).\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nt\u00b2 -10t +25 +14*( (-672t +6485)^2 )/(2632\u00b2) = 78750/3136.\n\nThis seems very complicated.

We need to find the equation of line AD, which connects points A(10,0) and D(-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nFirst, compute the slope of AD.\n\nSlope m = (y2 - y1)/(x2 -x1) = (30\u221a14/11 - 0)/( -15/22 -10 )= (30\u221a14/11)/( -15/22 -220/22 )= (30\u221a14/11)/( -235/22 ).\n\nSimplify: 30\u221a14/11 * 22/(-235)= (30\u221a14 *2)/(-235)= (60\u221a14)/(-235)= -60\u221a14/235.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator by 5: 60/5=12, 235/5=47.\n\nSo, slope m= -12\u221a14 /47.\n\nSo, the equation of line AD is y -0 = m(x -10), so y= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nNow, we need to find point P where this line intersects the circumcircle \u03c9 again. We already know that A is on both the line and the circle, so we need the other intersection point P.\n\nThe equation of the circle \u03c9 is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y=0.\n\nAnd the equation of line AD is y= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nLet me substitute y into the circle's equation.\n\nSo, substitute y= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10) into x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y=0.\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst, compute y\u00b2:\n\ny\u00b2= [ (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10) ]^2 = (144*14)/(47\u00b2) * (x -10)^2 = (2016)/(2209)*(x\u00b2 -20x +100).\n\nThen, compute (5\u221a14/28)y:\n\n(5\u221a14/28)*(-12\u221a14/47)(x -10)= (5\u221a14 * -12\u221a14)/(28*47) (x -10).\n\nMultiply the terms:\n\n5*(-12)= -60.\n\n\u221a14*\u221a14=14.\n\n28*47=1316.\n\nSo, this becomes (-60*14)/1316 (x-10)= (-840)/1316 (x-10)= (-210)/329 (x-10).\n\nSimplify: -210 and 329 have a common factor of 7? 210 \u00f77=30, 329 \u00f77=47. So, -30/47 (x -10).\n\nSo, now, substituting into the circle equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + [2016/2209 (x\u00b2 -20x +100)] -10x - [ (-210/329)(x-10) ] =0.",

Common factor 7.\n\nSo, divide numerator and denominator by 7: 105/7=15, 154/7=22.\n\nSo, simplified fraction is -15/22.\n\nThus, x= -15/22.\n\nNow, find y from tangent at C: y= -4\u221a14 x = -4\u221a14*(-15/22)= (60\u221a14)/22= (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo, point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, find equation of line AD.

Since A is already on the circle, the other intersection is P.\n\nThe equation of the circle \u03c9 is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y = 0.\n\nSubstitute x and y from the parametric equations into the circle's equation.\n\nLet me denote t as a parameter.\n\nSo, substitute:\n\nx = 10 - (235/22)t\n\ny = 0 + (30\u221a14/11)t\n\nPlug into the circle equation:\n\n(10 - (235/22)t)^2 + ( (30\u221a14/11)t )^2 -10*(10 - (235/22)t) - (5\u221a14/28)*(30\u221a14/11)t = 0\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: (10 - (235/22)t)^2\n\n= 100 - 2*10*(235/22)t + (235/22)^2 t^2\n\n= 100 - (4700/22)t + (55225/484)t^2\n\nSimplify:\n\n4700/22 = 2350/11 \u2248 213.636\n\n55225/484 \u2248 114.08\n\nSecond term: ( (30\u221a14/11)t )^2 = (900*14)/(121) t^2 = 12600/121 t^2 \u2248 104.132 t^2\n\nThird term: -10*(10 - (235/22)t) = -100 + (2350/22)t = -100 + (1175/11)t \u2248 -100 + 106.818 t\n\nFourth term: -(5\u221a14/28)*(30\u221a14/11)t = -(5*30*14)/(28*11) t = -(2100)/(308) t = -2100/308 t = Simplify this.\n\n2100 divided by 308: let's see, 308*6=1848, 308*7=2156 which is too much. So, 2100-1848=252. So, 2100=308*6 +252. 252=308*(252/308)= 252/308= 9/11. So, 2100=308*(6 + 9/11)=308*(75/11). So, 2100/308=75/11.

So, equation is y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\nSimilarly, tangent at B: point B is (39/5, 6\u221a14/5), slope m_B = -56\u221a14/311.\n\nEquation: y - 6\u221a14/5 = m_B (x - 39/5).\n\nSo,\n\ny = (-56\u221a14/311)(x - 39/5) + 6\u221a14/5.\n\nNow, to find point D, which is the intersection of these two tangents.\n\nSo, set the two equations equal:\n\n-4\u221a14 x = (-56\u221a14/311)(x - 39/5) + 6\u221a14/5.\n\nLet me divide both sides by \u221a14 to simplify:\n\n-4x = (-56/311)(x -39/5) +6/5.\n\nMultiply through by 311 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-4x *311 = -56(x -39/5) +6/5 *311.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-4*311 x = -1244x.\n\n-56(x -39/5) = -56x + (56*39)/5 = -56x + 2208/5.\n\n6/5 *311 = 1866/5.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n-1244x = (-56x + 2208/5) + 1866/5.\n\nCombine constants on the right:\n\n2208/5 +1866/5 = (2208 +1866)/5 = 4074/5.\n\nSo,\n\n-1244x = -56x + 4074/5.\n\nBring terms with x to the left:\n\n-1244x +56x =4074/5.\n\n-1188x =4074/5.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n1188x = -4074/5.\n\nx = (-4074)/(5*1188).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n4074 and 1188: let's see, 4074 divided by 6 is 679, 1188 divided by 6 is 198.\n\nSo, x= (-679)/(5*198) = (-679)/990.",

Then, from x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 81:\n\n(39/5)^2 + y\u00b2 = 81 \u21d2 (1521/25) + y\u00b2 = 81 \u21d2 y\u00b2 = 81 - 1521/25 = (2025/25 - 1521/25) = 504/25 \u21d2 y = sqrt(504)/5 = (6*sqrt(14))/5.\n\nSo point B is at (39/5, 6\u221a14/5).\n\nNow, let's find the equation of the tangent lines at B and C.\n\nThe tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point.

Or, to make it cleaner, we can multiply both sides by 28 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n280x + 5\u221a14 y = 0.\n\nBut maybe we can just keep it as D x + E y = 0, which is -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y = 0.\n\nSimilarly, the tangent at point B (39/5, 6\u221a14/5) can be found using the same formula.\n\nSo, plugging x1=39/5, y1=6\u221a14/5 into the tangent formula:\n\nx*(39/5) + y*(6\u221a14/5) + D*(x + 39/5)/2 + E*(y + 6\u221a14/5)/2 = 0.\n\nWe know D = -10 and E = -5\u221a14/28.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n(39/5)x + (6\u221a14/5)y + (-10)*(x + 39/5)/2 + (-5\u221a14/28)*(y + 6\u221a14/5)/2 = 0.\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: (39/5)x + (6\u221a14/5)y.\n\nSecond term: (-10)*(x + 39/5)/2 = (-10/2)*(x + 39/5) = -5*(x + 39/5) = -5x - 39.\n\nThird term: (-5\u221a14/28)*(y + 6\u221a14/5)/2.\n\nFirst, compute y + 6\u221a14/5.\n\nThen, multiply by (-5\u221a14/28)/2 = (-5\u221a14)/(56).\n\nSo, the third term becomes [ (-5\u221a14)/56 ]*(y + 6\u221a14/5).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n= (-5\u221a14 y)/56 + (-5\u221a14 * 6\u221a14)/(56*5)\n\nSimplify each part:\n\nFirst part: (-5\u221a14 y)/56.\n\nSecond part: (-5\u221a14 *6\u221a14)/(56*5) = (-5*6*(\u221a14)^2)/(56*5) = (-30*14)/(280) = (-420)/(280) = -1.5 or -3/2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the third term is (-5\u221a14 y)/56 - 3/2.\n\nSo, now the entire equation is:\n\n(39/5)x + (6\u221a14/5)y -5x -39 + (-5\u221a14 y)/56 -3/2 = 0.\n\nLet me combine like terms.\n\nFirst, combine the x terms:\n\n(39/5)x -5x = (39/5 -25/5)x = (14/5)x.\n\nNext, the y terms:\n\n(6\u221a14/5)y + (-5\u221a14/56)y.\n\nTo combine these, let's find a common denominator, which is 5*56=280.\n\nConvert 6\u221a14/5 to (6\u221a14 *56)/280 = (336\u221a14)/280.\n\nConvert -5\u221a14/56 to (-5\u221a14 *5)/280 = (-25\u221a14)/280.\n\nSo, total y terms: (336\u221a14 -25\u221a14)/280 = (311\u221a14)/280 y.\n\nThen, the constants:\n\n-39 - 3/2 = -39 -1.5 = -40.5 = -81/2.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n(14/5)x + (311\u221a14/280)y -81/2 = 0.\n\nMultiply through by 280 to eliminate denominators:\n\n14/5 x *280 = 14*56 x = 784x\n\n311\u221a14/280 y *280 = 311\u221a14 y\n\n-81/2 *280 = -81*140 = -11340\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n784x + 311\u221a14 y -11340 = 0.\n\nSo, the tangent at B is 784x + 311\u221a14 y = 11340.\n\nAnd the tangent at C is -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y = 0.\n\nNow, I need to find the intersection point D of these two tangents.\n\nSo, I have two equations:\n\n1) 784x + 311\u221a14 y = 11340\n\n2) -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y = 0\n\nLet me solve equation 2 for x in terms of y.\n\nFrom equation 2:\n\n-10x = (5\u221a14/28) y\n\nMultiply both sides by -1/10:\n\nx = -(5\u221a14)/(28*10) y = -(\u221a14)/56 y.\n\nSo, x = (-\u221a14 /56)y.\n\nNow, plug this into equation 1:\n\n784*(-\u221a14 /56)y + 311\u221a14 y = 11340\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n784 divided by 56 is 14. So,\n\n14*(-\u221a14)y + 311\u221a14 y = 11340\n\nSo, (-14\u221a14 + 311\u221a14)y = 11340\n\nFactor out \u221a14:\n\n( (-14 + 311 )\u221a14 ) y = 11340\n\nCompute -14 +311=297.\n\nSo, 297\u221a14 y = 11340.\n\nThus, y = 11340 / (297\u221a14).\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\n11340 and 297. Let's see, 297 divides by 9: 297/9=33. 11340 /9=1260.\n\nSo, 1260 /33\u221a14.\n\nSimplify 1260 and 33: both divisible by 3.\n\n1260/3=420, 33/3=11.\n\nSo, 420/(11\u221a14).\n\nRationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by \u221a14:\n\n(420\u221a14)/(11*14) = (420\u221a14)/154.\n\nSimplify 420/154: divide numerator and denominator by 14.\n\n420 \u00f714=30, 154 \u00f714=11.\n\nSo, 30\u221a14 /11.\n\nThus, y = 30\u221a14 /11.\n\nThen, x = (-\u221a14 /56)y = (-\u221a14 /56)*(30\u221a14 /11).\n\nMultiply together:\n\n(-\u221a14 *30\u221a14) / (56*11) = (-30*14)/(616).\n\nBecause \u221a14 *\u221a14=14.\n\nSo, numerator is -30*14= -420.\n\nDenominator is 56*11=616.\n\nThus, x= -420/616.\n\nSimplify: both divide by 28. 420/28=15, 616/28=22.\n\nSo, x= -15/22.\n\nSo, point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14 /11).\n\nNow, I need to find point P, which is the intersection of line AD with the circle \u03c9, other than A.\n\nSo, let's find the parametric equation of line AD.\n\nPoint A is at (10,0), and point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14 /11).\n\nSo, the vector from A to D is (-15/22 -10, 30\u221a14/11 -0) = (-15/22 - 220/22, 30\u221a14/11) = (-235/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nSo, parametric equations can be written as:\n\nx = 10 + t*(-235/22)\n\ny = 0 + t*(30\u221a14/11)\n\nWe need to find the point P where this line intersects the circle \u03c9 again. Since A is already on the circle, the other intersection is P.\n\nThe equation of the circle \u03c9 is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y = 0.\n\nSubstitute x and y from the parametric equations into the circle's equation.\n\nLet me denote t as a parameter.\n\nSo, substitute:\n\nx = 10 - (235/22)t\n\ny = 0 + (30\u221a14/11)t\n\nPlug into the circle equation:\n\n(10 - (235/22)t)^2 + ( (30\u221a14/11)t )^2 -10*(10 - (235/22)t) - (5\u221a14/28)*(30\u221a14/11)t = 0\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: (10 - (235/22)t)^2\n\n= 100 - 2*10*(235/22)t + (235/22)^2 t^2\n\n= 100 - (4700/22)t + (55225/484)t^2\n\nSimplify:\n\n4700/22 = 2350/11 \u2248 213.636\n\n55225/484 \u2248 114.08\n\nSecond term: ( (30\u221a14/11)t )^2 = (900*14)/(121) t^2 = 12600/121 t^2 \u2248 104.132 t^2\n\nThird term: -10*(10 - (235/22)t) = -100 + (2350/22)t = -100 + (1175/11)t \u2248 -100 + 106.818 t\n\nFourth term: -(5\u221a14/28)*(30\u221a14/11)t = -(5*30*14)/(28*11) t = -(2100)/(308) t = -2100/308 t = Simplify this.\n\n2100 divided by 308: let's see, 308*6=1848, 308*7=2156 which is too much. So, 2100-1848=252. So, 2100=308*6 +252. 252=308*(252/308)= 252/308= 9/11. So, 2100=308*(6 + 9/11)=308*(75/11). So, 2100/308=75/11. So, the term is -75/11 t.\n\nPutting all the terms together:\n\nFirst term: 100 - (2350/11)t + (55225/484)t^2\n\nSecond term: +12600/121 t^2\n\nThird term: -100 + (1175/11)t\n\nFourth term: -75/11 t\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nConstant terms: 100 -100 = 0.\n\nt terms: (-2350/11 + 1175/11 -75/11 )t\n\n= [ (-2350 + 1175 -75)/11 ]t\n\n= (-1250)/11 t\n\nt\u00b2 terms: (55225/484 + 12600/121 ) t\u00b2\n\nConvert 12600/121 to 50400/484 by multiplying numerator and denominator by 4.\n\nSo, 55225 +50400 = 105625. So, 105625/484 t\u00b2.\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\n105625/484 t\u00b2 -1250/11 t = 0.\n\nFactor out t:\n\nt*(105625/484 t -1250/11) = 0.\n\nSo, solutions are t=0, which corresponds to point A, and the other solution is:\n\n105625/484 t -1250/11 =0\n\nSolving for t:\n\n105625/484 t = 1250/11\n\nt = (1250/11) * (484/105625)\n\nSimplify fractions.\n\nFirst, 1250 and 105625: 105625 \u00f71250 = 84.5.

The center O is (5, 5\u221a14/56), so the slope of OC is (5\u221a14/56)/5 = \u221a14/56. Therefore, the slope of the tangent at C is -56/\u221a14.

So that's correct.\n\nNow, back to the problem. We need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C.\n\nSince we have the coordinates of O, and points B and C, we can find the equations of the tangents at B and C, then find their intersection point D.\n\nTangent at B:\n\nThe tangent at B is perpendicular to the radius OB.

          "text2": "Wait, no, slope of tangent is negative reciprocal of slope of OB.\n\nSo slope of OB is (y_B - y_O)/(x_B - x_O) = [ (6\u221a14/5 - 5\u221a14/56) ] / (39/5 -5) = as I computed earlier, (311\u221a14/280)/(14/5) )= (311\u221a14/280) * (5/14) )= 311\u221a14/(280*14/5) )= 311\u221a14/( (280/5)*14 )= 311\u221a14/(56*14)= 311\u221a14/(784).\n\nSo slope of tangent is -784/(311\u221a14). Rationalizing, multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14:\n\n-784\u221a14/(311*14) = (-784/14)*\u221a14/311 = (-56)*\u221a14/311. So slope of tangent at B is (-56\u221a14)/311.\n\nSimilarly, the tangent at C is another line. Since C is at (0,0), and the tangent at C is perpendicular to the radius OC. The center O is (5, 5\u221a14/56), so the slope of OC is (5\u221a14/56)/5 = \u221a14/56. Therefore, the slope of the tangent at C is -56/\u221a14. Simplify this: -56/\u221a14 = -56\u221a14/14 = -4\u221a14.\n\nSo the tangent at C is a line passing through (0,0) with slope -4\u221a14. So its equation is y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\nSimilarly, the tangent at B is a line with slope (-56\u221a14)/311 passing through point B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5). So its equation is y - 6\u221a14/5 = [ (-56\u221a14)/311 ] (x - 39/5).\n\nNow, point D is the intersection of the two tangents. So we can find D by solving the two equations:\n\n1. y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\n2. y = [ (-56\u221a14)/311 ] (x - 39/5 ) + 6\u221a14/5.\n\nLet me substitute equation 1 into equation 2.\n\n-4\u221a14 x = [ (-56\u221a14)/311 ] (x - 39/5 ) + 6\u221a14/5.\n\nLet me divide both sides by \u221a14 to simplify:\n\n-4x = [ (-56)/311 ] (x - 39/5 ) + 6/5.\n\nMultiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-4x * 311 = -56(x - 39/5) + (6/5)*311.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nLeft side: -1244 x.\n\nRight side: -56x + (56 * 39)/5 + (6 * 311)/5.\n\nCompute 56 * 39: 56*40=2240, minus 56=2184. So 2184/5.\n\n6*311=1866. So 1866/5.\n\nSo right side: -56x + 2184/5 + 1866/5 = -56x + (2184 + 1866)/5 = -56x + 4050/5 = -56x + 810.\n\nSo now equation is:\n\n-1244x = -56x + 810.\n\nBring -56x to the left:\n\n-1244x +56x = 810 \u21d2 (-1188)x = 810 \u21d2 x = 810 / (-1188).\n\nSimplify fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 18: 810 \u00f718=45, 1188 \u00f718=66.\n\nSo x= -45/66. Simplify further by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: -15/22.\n\nSo x coordinate of D is -15/22.\n\nThen, from equation 1, y = -4\u221a14 x = -4\u221a14*(-15/22) = (60\u221a14)/22 = (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, I need to find point P where line AD intersects the circumcircle again. Since A is at (10,0) and D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11), let me find the parametric equation of line AD.\n\nParametrize AD with parameter t. Let me write it as:\n\nx = 10 + t*(-15/22 -10) = 10 + t*(-235/22).\n\ny = 0 + t*(30\u221a14/11 -0) = t*(30\u221a14/11).\n\nSo x = 10 - (235/22)t.\n\ny = (30\u221a14/11) t.\n\nWe need to find the value of t where this parametric line intersects the circumcircle again. Since A is on both the line and the circle, t=0 corresponds to A, and t=T corresponds to P.\n\nPlug x and y into the circle equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + Ey =0.",

Then, AB = 5, which is the distance from (10,0) to (x,y):\n\n\u221a[(x -10)^2 + y^2] = 5 \u2192 (x-10)^2 + y^2 = 25.\n\nAnd BC = 9, which is the distance from (0,0) to (x,y):\n\n\u221a[x^2 + y^2] = 9 \u2192 x^2 + y^2 = 81.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. (x -10)^2 + y^2 = 25\n2. x^2 + y^2 = 81\n\nSubtract equation 2 from equation 1:\n\n(x -10)^2 + y^2 - x^2 - y^2 = 25 -81 \u2192 (x\u00b2 -20x +100) - x\u00b2 = -56 \u2192 -20x +100 = -56 \u2192 -20x = -156 \u2192 x = 156 /20 = 39/5 = 7.8.\n\nSo, x = 7.8, which is 39/5. Then, plug back into equation 2 to find y:\n\n(39/5)^2 + y^2 =81 \u2192 (1521/25) + y^2 =81 \u2192 y^2 =81 - 1521/25 = (2025 -1521)/25 = 504/25 \u2192 y= sqrt(504)/5 = (6\u221a14)/5.\n\nSo, point B is at (39/5, 6\u221a14/5). Okay, now I have coordinates for A(10,0), B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5), C(0,0).\n\nNow, let's find the equations for the tangents at B and C. Tangent at B and tangent at C intersect at D.\n\nTo find the tangent to a circle at a point, we can use the formula that the tangent is perpendicular to the radius at that point.\n\nBut first, we need the center of the circle \u03c9, which is the circumcircle of triangle ABC.\n\nWe can find the circumcenter O by finding the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC.\n\nBut since we have coordinates for A, B, and C, perhaps we can compute O.",

Then, find their intersection point D.\n\nFirst, let's find the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9. Since it passes through A(10,0), B(39/5,6\u221a14/5), C(0,0). Let's find its equation.\n\nGeneral equation of a circle: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0.\n\nSince point C(0,0) is on the circle: 0 +0 +0 +0 +c=0 => c=0.

Let me rationalize that: 84/(11\u221a14) = (84\u221a14)/(11*14) )= (6\u221a14)/11.\n\nSimilarly, compute slope of OC:\n\nPoint C is (0,0), and O is (9/2, 33\u221a14/56).\n\nSlope of OC: (33\u221a14/56 - 0)/(9/2 - 0) = (33\u221a14/56)/(9/2) = (33\u221a14/56)*(2/9) = (66\u221a14)/(504) = (11\u221a14)/84.\n\nThus, the slope of the tangent at C is the negative reciprocal of that, which is -84/(11\u221a14) = (-84\u221a14)/(11*14) = (-6\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo, equations of the tangents:\n\nTangent at B: passes through B(9,0) with slope 6\u221a14/11.\n\nEquation: y - 0 = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9).\n\nSimilarly, tangent at C: passes through C(0,0) with slope (-6\u221a14)/11.\n\nEquation: y = (-6\u221a14/11)(x -0) = (-6\u221a14/11)x.\n\nNow, find the intersection point D of these two tangents.\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1. y = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9)\n\n2. y = (-6\u221a14/11)x\n\nSet them equal:\n\n(6\u221a14/11)(x -9) = (-6\u221a14/11)x\n\nMultiply both sides by 11/(6\u221a14):\n\nx -9 = -x \u2192 2x =9 \u2192 x=9/2.\n\nThen, substitute x=9/2 into equation 2:\n\ny = (-6\u221a14/11)*(9/2) = (-54\u221a14)/22 = (-27\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo, point D is at (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, I need to find the equation of line AD.\n\nPoints A(26/3, 4\u221a14/3) and D(9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nFirst, compute the slope of AD:\n\nm_AD = [ (-27\u221a14/11 - 4\u221a14/3) ] / [ 9/2 - 26/3 ]\n\nCompute numerator:\n\nConvert to common denominator, which is 33.\n\n-27\u221a14/11 = -81\u221a14/33.\n\n4\u221a14/3 = 44\u221a14/33.\n\nSo, numerator: (-81\u221a14/33 - 44\u221a14/33) = (-125\u221a14)/33.\n\nDenominator:\n\n9/2 -26/3 = (27/6 -52/6) = (-25/6).\n\nSo, slope m_AD = [ (-125\u221a14/33) ] / [ (-25/6) ] = (125\u221a14/33) * (6/25) = (125*6\u221a14)/(33*25) = (750\u221a14)/(825).\n\nSimplify: 750 and 825 share a GCD of 75. 750 \u00f775=10; 825 \u00f775=11.\n\nSo, m_AD = (10\u221a14)/11.\n\nThus, the equation of AD is:\n\ny - 4\u221a14/3 = (10\u221a14/11)(x - 26/3).\n\nNow, we need to find the other intersection point P of line AD with the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nWe already know that point A is on both AD and \u03c9, so P is the other intersection point.\n\nTo find P, we can solve the equation of line AD with the equation of \u03c9.\n\nFirst, let's write the equation of \u03c9.\n\nWe have center at O(9/2, 33\u221a14/56) and radius R = 75\u221a14/56.\n\nSo, equation of \u03c9 is:\n\n(x - 9/2)^2 + (y - 33\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nLet me expand this equation:\n\n(x - 9/2)^2 + (y - 33\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nNow, let's express line AD in parametric form to substitute into the circle equation.",
          "text2": "Wait, no, slope of tangent is negative reciprocal of slope of OB.\n\nSo slope of OB is (y_B - y_O)/(x_B - x_O) = [ (6\u221a14/5 - 5\u221a14/56) ] / (39/5 -5) = as I computed earlier, (311\u221a14/280)/(14/5) )= (311\u221a14/280) * (5/14) )= 311\u221a14/(280*14/5) )= 311\u221a14/( (280/5)*14 )= 311\u221a14/(56*14)= 311\u221a14/(784).\n\nSo slope of tangent is -784/(311\u221a14). Rationalizing, multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14:\n\n-784\u221a14/(311*14) = (-784/14)*\u221a14/311 = (-56)*\u221a14/311. So slope of tangent at B is (-56\u221a14)/311.\n\nSimilarly, the tangent at C is another line. Since C is at (0,0), and the tangent at C is perpendicular to the radius OC. The center O is (5, 5\u221a14/56), so the slope of OC is (5\u221a14/56)/5 = \u221a14/56. Therefore, the slope of the tangent at C is -56/\u221a14. Simplify this: -56/\u221a14 = -56\u221a14/14 = -4\u221a14.\n\nSo the tangent at C is a line passing through (0,0) with slope -4\u221a14. So its equation is y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\nSimilarly, the tangent at B is a line with slope (-56\u221a14)/311 passing through point B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5). So its equation is y - 6\u221a14/5 = [ (-56\u221a14)/311 ] (x - 39/5).\n\nNow, point D is the intersection of the two tangents. So we can find D by solving the two equations:\n\n1. y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\n2. y = [ (-56\u221a14)/311 ] (x - 39/5 ) + 6\u221a14/5.\n\nLet me substitute equation 1 into equation 2.\n\n-4\u221a14 x = [ (-56\u221a14)/311 ] (x - 39/5 ) + 6\u221a14/5.\n\nLet me divide both sides by \u221a14 to simplify:\n\n-4x = [ (-56)/311 ] (x - 39/5 ) + 6/5.\n\nMultiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-4x * 311 = -56(x - 39/5) + (6/5)*311.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nLeft side: -1244 x.\n\nRight side: -56x + (56 * 39)/5 + (6 * 311)/5.\n\nCompute 56 * 39: 56*40=2240, minus 56=2184. So 2184/5.\n\n6*311=1866. So 1866/5.\n\nSo right side: -56x + 2184/5 + 1866/5 = -56x + (2184 + 1866)/5 = -56x + 4050/5 = -56x + 810.\n\nSo now equation is:\n\n-1244x = -56x + 810.\n\nBring -56x to the left:\n\n-1244x +56x = 810 \u21d2 (-1188)x = 810 \u21d2 x = 810 / (-1188).\n\nSimplify fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 18: 810 \u00f718=45, 1188 \u00f718=66.\n\nSo x= -45/66. Simplify further by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: -15/22.\n\nSo x coordinate of D is -15/22.\n\nThen, from equation 1, y = -4\u221a14 x = -4\u221a14*(-15/22) = (60\u221a14)/22 = (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, I need to find point P where line AD intersects the circumcircle again. Since A is at (10,0) and D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11), let me find the parametric equation of line AD.\n\nParametrize AD with parameter t. Let me write it as:\n\nx = 10 + t*(-15/22 -10) = 10 + t*(-235/22).\n\ny = 0 + t*(30\u221a14/11 -0) = t*(30\u221a14/11).\n\nSo x = 10 - (235/22)t.\n\ny = (30\u221a14/11) t.\n\nWe need to find the value of t where this parametric line intersects the circumcircle again. Since A is on both the line and the circle, t=0 corresponds to A, and t=T corresponds to P.\n\nPlug x and y into the circle equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + Ey =0.",

So O is at (5,5\u221a14/56).\n\nNow, the tangent at C is a line perpendicular to the radius OC. Since C is at (0,0), the radius OC is the line from O(5,5\u221a14/56) to C(0,0). So, the slope of OC is (5\u221a14/56 -0)/(5-0)= (5\u221a14/56)/5=\u221a14/56.\n\nSo, the slope of OC is \u221a14/56. Therefore, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: -56/\u221a14= -56\u221a14/14= -4\u221a14.\n\nSo, the tangent at C has slope -4\u221a14 and passes through C(0,0). So, its equation is y= -4\u221a14 x.\n\nSimilarly, the tangent at B: Let's compute its equation. The radius OB has slope (y_B - y_O)/(x_B - x_O).

So 2184/5.\n\n6*311=1866.

Simplify further by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: -15/22.\n\nSo x coordinate of D is -15/22.\n\nThen, from equation 1, y = -4\u221a14 x = -4\u221a14*(-15/22) = (60\u221a14)/22 = (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, I need to find point P where line AD intersects the circumcircle again. Since A is at (10,0) and D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11), let me find the parametric equation of line AD.\n\nParametrize AD with parameter t.

Tangent at B: y = (-56\u221a14/311)(x -39/5) +6\u221a14/5.\n\nWe need to find their intersection point D.\n\nSo, set the two equations equal:\n\n-4\u221a14 x = (-56\u221a14/311)(x -39/5) +6\u221a14/5.\n\nLet me divide both sides by \u221a14 to simplify:\n\n-4x = (-56/311)(x -39/5) +6/5.\n\nNow, let's simplify this equation.\n\nMultiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-4x *311 = -56(x -39/5) + (6/5)*311.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nLeft side: -1244x.\n\nRight side: -56x + (56*39)/5 + (6*311)/5.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n56*39: 56*(40-1)=2240 -56=2184.\n\n56*39=2184.\n\nSo, -56x + 2184/5 + (6*311)/5.\n\n6*311=1866.\n\nSo, -56x + (2184 +1866)/5 = -56x +4050/5 = -56x +810.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n-1244x = -56x +810.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-1244x +56x -810 =0 \u2192 (-1188x) -810=0 \u2192 -1188x=810 \u2192 x=810/(-1188)= -810/1188.\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 9: 810 \u00f79=90, 1188 \u00f79=132.\n\nSo, x= -90/132.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 6: 90 \u00f76=15, 132 \u00f76=22.\n\nSo, x= -15/22.\n\nTherefore, x= -15/22.\n\nNow, substitute x into tangent at C to find y:\n\ny= -4\u221a14 x = -4\u221a14*(-15/22)= (60\u221a14)/22= (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo, point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nAlright, now we have point D(-15/22,30\u221a14/11). Now, we need to find the equation of line AD, then find its intersection with the circumcircle \u03c9, which is point P.\n\nPoint A is at (10,0), and point D is at (-15/22,30\u221a14/11). Let's compute the equation of line AD.\n\nFirst, find the slope of AD.\n\nSlope m_AD= (y_D - y_A)/(x_D - x_A) = (30\u221a14/11 -0)/( -15/22 -10 ).\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n-15/22 -10 = -15/22 -220/22 = (-235)/22.\n\nSo, slope m_AD= (30\u221a14/11)/(-235/22)= (30\u221a14/11)*( -22/235 )= (30\u221a14 * (-22))/(11*235).\n\nSimplify:\n\n30 and 235: 235=5*47, 30=5*6. So, 30/235=6/47.\n\nSimilarly, 22 and 11: 22/11=2.\n\nSo, m_AD= (30\u221a14 * (-22))/(11*235) = ( (30/235)*(22/11) )*(-\u221a14).\n\nWhich becomes (6/47 * 2)*(-\u221a14)= (12/47)*(-\u221a14)= -12\u221a14/47.\n\nSo, slope m_AD= -12\u221a14/47.\n\nNow, equation of line AD: using point A(10,0):\n\ny -0 = m_AD*(x -10) \u2192 y= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nWe need to find the other intersection point P of line AD with the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nWe already know that A is on \u03c9 and on AD, so P is the other point.\n\nSo, to find P, we can solve the equation of line AD together with the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nFirst, equation of \u03c9: since it's the circumcircle of triangle ABC, and we have three points on it. But since we know the center is O(5,5\u221a14/56), and radius R=75\u221a14/56.\n\nSo, equation of \u03c9 is (x -5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n(x -5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n(75\u221a14)^2 = 75^2 *14=5625*14=78750.\n\nDenominator:56^2=3136.\n\nSo, right side is 78750/3136.\n\nNow, equation of line AD is y= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nLet me substitute this into the equation of \u03c9.\n\nSo, substitute y = (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10) into the circle equation.\n\nLet me denote m = -12\u221a14/47 for simplicity.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(x -5)^2 + (m(x -10) -5\u221a14/56)^2 = 78750/3136.\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\nFirst term: (x -5)^2 = x\u00b2 -10x +25.\n\nSecond term: [ m(x -10) -5\u221a14/56 ]^2.\n\nLet me compute m(x-10):\n\nm(x-10) = (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n(-12\u221a14/47)(x -10) -5\u221a14/56.\n\nLet me factor out \u221a14:\n\n\u221a14 [ (-12/47)(x -10) -5/(56) ].\n\nSo, the square is:\n\n14 * [ (-12/47)(x -10) -5/56 ]^2.\n\nSo, the second term is 14 * [ (-12/47)(x -10) -5/56 ]^2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the equation is:\n\n(x\u00b2 -10x +25) +14*[ (-12/47 (x -10) -5/56 ) ]^2 = 78750/3136.\n\nThis looks a bit messy, but perhaps we can simplify step by step.\n\nLet me denote t = x.\n\nCompute the expression inside the square brackets:\n\n(-12/47)(t -10) -5/56.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nLet me find a common denominator for the coefficients. 47 and 56 are coprime, so the LCD is 47*56=2632.\n\nSo, write each term with denominator 2632.\n\n-12/47 = (-12*56)/2632 = (-672)/2632.\n\n-5/56= (-5*47)/2632 = (-235)/2632.\n\nSo, (-12/47)(t -10) = (-672/2632)(t -10).\n\nSo, the entire expression becomes:\n\n(-672/2632)(t -10) -235/2632 = [ -672(t -10) -235 ] /2632.\n\nSo, the expression is [ -672t +6720 -235 ] /2632 = [ -672t +6485 ] /2632.\n\nTherefore, the second term is 14 * [ (-672t +6485)/2632 ]^2.\n\nWhich is 14*( (-672t +6485)^2 )/(2632^2).\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nt\u00b2 -10t +25 +14*( (-672t +6485)^2 )/(2632\u00b2) = 78750/3136.\n\nThis seems very complicated.

We need to find the equation of line AD, which connects points A(10,0) and D(-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nFirst, compute the slope of AD.\n\nSlope m = (y2 - y1)/(x2 -x1) = (30\u221a14/11 - 0)/( -15/22 -10 )= (30\u221a14/11)/( -15/22 -220/22 )= (30\u221a14/11)/( -235/22 ).\n\nSimplify: 30\u221a14/11 * 22/(-235)= (30\u221a14 *2)/(-235)= (60\u221a14)/(-235)= -60\u221a14/235.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator by 5: 60/5=12, 235/5=47.\n\nSo, slope m= -12\u221a14 /47.\n\nSo, the equation of line AD is y -0 = m(x -10), so y= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nNow, we need to find point P where this line intersects the circumcircle \u03c9 again. We already know that A is on both the line and the circle, so we need the other intersection point P.\n\nThe equation of the circle \u03c9 is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y=0.\n\nAnd the equation of line AD is y= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nLet me substitute y into the circle's equation.\n\nSo, substitute y= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10) into x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y=0.\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst, compute y\u00b2:\n\ny\u00b2= [ (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10) ]^2 = (144*14)/(47\u00b2) * (x -10)^2 = (2016)/(2209)*(x\u00b2 -20x +100).\n\nThen, compute (5\u221a14/28)y:\n\n(5\u221a14/28)*(-12\u221a14/47)(x -10)= (5\u221a14 * -12\u221a14)/(28*47) (x -10).\n\nMultiply the terms:\n\n5*(-12)= -60.\n\n\u221a14*\u221a14=14.\n\n28*47=1316.\n\nSo, this becomes (-60*14)/1316 (x-10)= (-840)/1316 (x-10)= (-210)/329 (x-10).\n\nSimplify: -210 and 329 have a common factor of 7? 210 \u00f77=30, 329 \u00f77=47.

So, x = -45/66 = -15/22.\n\nSo, x = -15/22.\n\nNow, substitute back into y = -4\u221a14 x: y = -4\u221a14*(-15/22) = (60\u221a14)/22 = (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo, point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, we need to find line AD and its intersection with \u03c9 again at point P.\n\nFirst, find the equation of line AD.\n\nPoint A is at (10,0), point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nCompute the slope of AD:\n\nm = (30\u221a14/11 - 0)/(-15/22 -10) = (30\u221a14/11) / (-15/22 - 220/22) = (30\u221a14/11) / (-235/22) = (30\u221a14/11) * (-22/235) = (-60\u221a14)/235 = simplify numerator and denominator.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: (-12\u221a14)/47.\n\nSo, slope m = -12\u221a14/47.\n\nEquation of AD: using point A (10,0):\n\ny -0 = m(x -10) \u2192 y = (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nWe need to find the other intersection point P of AD with \u03c9.\n\nWe already know that A is on \u03c9 and AD, so P is the other point.\n\nWe can parametrize line AD and find its other intersection with \u03c9.",

Can't simplify further.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nx\u00b2 + (2016/2209)(x\u00b2 -20x +100) -10x + (210/329)(x -10)=0.\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nMultiply through by 2209*329 to eliminate denominators.",

Plugging in point C(0,0): 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0 \u21d2 F = 0.\n\nSo equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey = 0.\n\nPlugging in point A(10,0): 100 + 0 + 10D + 0 = 0 \u21d2 10D = -100 \u21d2 D = -10.\n\nSo equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + Ey = 0.\n\nNow, plugging in point B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5):\n\n(39/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 -10*(39/5) + E*(6\u221a14/5) = 0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(39/5)^2 = (1521)/25.\n\n(6\u221a14/5)^2 = (36 * 14)/25 = (504)/25.\n\n-10*(39/5) = -78.\n\nE*(6\u221a14/5) is (6\u221a14 E)/5.\n\nSo overall:\n\n1521/25 + 504/25 - 78 + (6\u221a14 E)/5 = 0.\n\nCombine the fractions: (1521 + 504)/25 = 2025/25 = 81.\n\nSo equation becomes: 81 -78 + (6\u221a14 E)/5 = 0 \u21d2 3 + (6\u221a14 E)/5 =0 \u21d2 (6\u221a14 E)/5 = -3 \u21d2 E = (-3 *5)/(6\u221a14) = (-15)/(6\u221a14) = (-5)/(2\u221a14).\n\nRationalizing the denominator: (-5\u221a14)/(2*14) = (-5\u221a14)/28.\n\nSo the equation of the circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + (-5\u221a14/28)y = 0.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy, but let's proceed.\n\nNow, to find the tangent at point B. The tangent to the circle at point (x\u2081, y\u2081) is given by:\n\nx x\u2081 + y y\u2081 + D*(x + x\u2081)/2 + E*(y + y\u2081)/2 + F = 0.",

Since it passes through (0,0), substituting gives 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0, so F = 0.\n\nSo, the equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey = 0.\n\nNow, plug in point A (10,0): 100 + 0 + 10D + 0 = 0 => 10D = -100 => D = -10.\n\nSo, equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + Ey = 0.\n\nNow, plug in point B (39/5, 6\u221a14/5):\n\n(39/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 -10*(39/5) + E*(6\u221a14/5) = 0.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n(39/5)^2 = (1521)/25\n(6\u221a14/5)^2 = (36*14)/25 = 504/25\n-10*(39/5) = -78\nE*(6\u221a14/5) remains as is.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n1521/25 + 504/25 -78 + (6\u221a14 E)/5 = 0\n\nCompute 1521 + 504 = 2025, so 2025/25 = 81.\n\nSo, 81 -78 + (6\u221a14 E)/5 = 0.\n\nWhich is 3 + (6\u221a14 E)/5 = 0.\n\nSo, (6\u221a14 E)/5 = -3 => E = (-3 *5)/(6\u221a14) = (-15)/(6\u221a14) = (-5)/(2\u221a14).\n\nRationalizing the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14:\n\nE = (-5\u221a14)/(2*14) = (-5\u221a14)/28.\n\nSo, the equation of the circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y = 0.\n\nNow, I need to find the equation of the tangent at point C (0,0) to this circle.

The center O is (5, 5\u221a14/56), so the slope of OC is (5\u221a14/56)/5 = \u221a14/56. Therefore, the slope of the tangent at C is -56/\u221a14.

Then, AB = 5, which is the distance from (10,0) to (x,y):\n\n\u221a[(x -10)^2 + y^2] = 5 \u2192 (x-10)^2 + y^2 = 25.\n\nAnd BC = 9, which is the distance from (0,0) to (x,y):\n\n\u221a[x^2 + y^2] = 9 \u2192 x^2 + y^2 = 81.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. (x -10)^2 + y^2 = 25\n2. x^2 + y^2 = 81\n\nSubtract equation 2 from equation 1:\n\n(x -10)^2 + y^2 - x^2 - y^2 = 25 -81 \u2192 (x\u00b2 -20x +100) - x\u00b2 = -56 \u2192 -20x +100 = -56 \u2192 -20x = -156 \u2192 x = 156 /20 = 39/5 = 7.8.\n\nSo, x = 7.8, which is 39/5. Then, plug back into equation 2 to find y:\n\n(39/5)^2 + y^2 =81 \u2192 (1521/25) + y^2 =81 \u2192 y^2 =81 - 1521/25 = (2025 -1521)/25 = 504/25 \u2192 y= sqrt(504)/5 = (6\u221a14)/5.\n\nSo, point B is at (39/5, 6\u221a14/5). Okay, now I have coordinates for A(10,0), B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5), C(0,0).\n\nNow, let's find the equations for the tangents at B and C. Tangent at B and tangent at C intersect at D.\n\nTo find the tangent to a circle at a point, we can use the formula that the tangent is perpendicular to the radius at that point.\n\nBut first, we need the center of the circle \u03c9, which is the circumcircle of triangle ABC.\n\nWe can find the circumcenter O by finding the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC.\n\nBut since we have coordinates for A, B, and C, perhaps we can compute O.",

So we can find D by solving the two equations:\n\n1. y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\n2. y = [ (-56\u221a14)/311 ] (x - 39/5 ) + 6\u221a14/5.\n\nLet me substitute equation 1 into equation 2.\n\n-4\u221a14 x = [ (-56\u221a14)/311 ] (x - 39/5 ) + 6\u221a14/5.\n\nLet me divide both sides by \u221a14 to simplify:\n\n-4x = [ (-56)/311 ] (x - 39/5 ) + 6/5.\n\nMultiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-4x * 311 = -56(x - 39/5) + (6/5)*311.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nLeft side: -1244 x.\n\nRight side: -56x + (56 * 39)/5 + (6 * 311)/5.\n\nCompute 56 * 39: 56*40=2240, minus 56=2184. So 2184/5.\n\n6*311=1866. So 1866/5.\n\nSo right side: -56x + 2184/5 + 1866/5 = -56x + (2184 + 1866)/5 = -56x + 4050/5 = -56x + 810.\n\nSo now equation is:\n\n-1244x = -56x + 810.\n\nBring -56x to the left:\n\n-1244x +56x = 810 \u21d2 (-1188)x = 810 \u21d2 x = 810 / (-1188).\n\nSimplify fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 18: 810 \u00f718=45, 1188 \u00f718=66.\n\nSo x= -45/66. Simplify further by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: -15/22.\n\nSo x coordinate of D is -15/22.\n\nThen, from equation 1, y = -4\u221a14 x = -4\u221a14*(-15/22) = (60\u221a14)/22 = (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, I need to find point P where line AD intersects the circumcircle again. Since A is at (10,0) and D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11), let me find the parametric equation of line AD.\n\nParametrize AD with parameter t. Let me write it as:\n\nx = 10 + t*(-15/22 -10) = 10 + t*(-235/22).\n\ny = 0 + t*(30\u221a14/11 -0) = t*(30\u221a14/11).\n\nSo x = 10 - (235/22)t.\n\ny = (30\u221a14/11) t.\n\nWe need to find the value of t where this parametric line intersects the circumcircle again. Since A is on both the line and the circle, t=0 corresponds to A, and t=T corresponds to P.\n\nPlug x and y into the circle equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + Ey =0.",

Now, we need to find the equation of line AD, then find its intersection with the circumcircle \u03c9, which is point P.\n\nPoint A is at (10,0), and point D is at (-15/22,30\u221a14/11). Let's compute the equation of line AD.\n\nFirst, find the slope of AD.\n\nSlope m_AD= (y_D - y_A)/(x_D - x_A) = (30\u221a14/11 -0)/( -15/22 -10 ).\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n-15/22 -10 = -15/22 -220/22 = (-235)/22.\n\nSo, slope m_AD= (30\u221a14/11)/(-235/22)= (30\u221a14/11)*( -22/235 )= (30\u221a14 * (-22))/(11*235).\n\nSimplify:\n\n30 and 235: 235=5*47, 30=5*6. So, 30/235=6/47.\n\nSimilarly, 22 and 11: 22/11=2.\n\nSo, m_AD= (30\u221a14 * (-22))/(11*235) = ( (30/235)*(22/11) )*(-\u221a14).\n\nWhich becomes (6/47 * 2)*(-\u221a14)= (12/47)*(-\u221a14)= -12\u221a14/47.\n\nSo, slope m_AD= -12\u221a14/47.\n\nNow, equation of line AD: using point A(10,0):\n\ny -0 = m_AD*(x -10) \u2192 y= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nWe need to find the other intersection point P of line AD with the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nWe already know that A is on \u03c9 and on AD, so P is the other point.\n\nSo, to find P, we can solve the equation of line AD together with the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nFirst, equation of \u03c9: since it's the circumcircle of triangle ABC, and we have three points on it. But since we know the center is O(5,5\u221a14/56), and radius R=75\u221a14/56.\n\nSo, equation of \u03c9 is (x -5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n(x -5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n(75\u221a14)^2 = 75^2 *14=5625*14=78750.\n\nDenominator:56^2=3136.\n\nSo, right side is 78750/3136.\n\nNow, equation of line AD is y= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nLet me substitute this into the equation of \u03c9.\n\nSo, substitute y = (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10) into the circle equation.\n\nLet me denote m = -12\u221a14/47 for simplicity.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(x -5)^2 + (m(x -10) -5\u221a14/56)^2 = 78750/3136.\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\nFirst term: (x -5)^2 = x\u00b2 -10x +25.\n\nSecond term: [ m(x -10) -5\u221a14/56 ]^2.\n\nLet me compute m(x-10):\n\nm(x-10) = (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n(-12\u221a14/47)(x -10) -5\u221a14/56.\n\nLet me factor out \u221a14:\n\n\u221a14 [ (-12/47)(x -10) -5/(56) ].\n\nSo, the square is:\n\n14 * [ (-12/47)(x -10) -5/56 ]^2.\n\nSo, the second term is 14 * [ (-12/47)(x -10) -5/56 ]^2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the equation is:\n\n(x\u00b2 -10x +25) +14*[ (-12/47 (x -10) -5/56 ) ]^2 = 78750/3136.\n\nThis looks a bit messy, but perhaps we can simplify step by step.\n\nLet me denote t = x.\n\nCompute the expression inside the square brackets:\n\n(-12/47)(t -10) -5/56.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nLet me find a common denominator for the coefficients. 47 and 56 are coprime, so the LCD is 47*56=2632.\n\nSo, write each term with denominator 2632.\n\n-12/47 = (-12*56)/2632 = (-672)/2632.\n\n-5/56= (-5*47)/2632 = (-235)/2632.\n\nSo, (-12/47)(t -10) = (-672/2632)(t -10).\n\nSo, the entire expression becomes:\n\n(-672/2632)(t -10) -235/2632 = [ -672(t -10) -235 ] /2632.\n\nSo, the expression is [ -672t +6720 -235 ] /2632 = [ -672t +6485 ] /2632.\n\nTherefore, the second term is 14 * [ (-672t +6485)/2632 ]^2.\n\nWhich is 14*( (-672t +6485)^2 )/(2632^2).\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nt\u00b2 -10t +25 +14*( (-672t +6485)^2 )/(2632\u00b2) = 78750/3136.\n\nThis seems very complicated.

So O is at (5,5\u221a14/56).\n\nNow, the tangent at C is a line perpendicular to the radius OC. Since C is at (0,0), the radius OC is the line from O(5,5\u221a14/56) to C(0,0). So, the slope of OC is (5\u221a14/56 -0)/(5-0)= (5\u221a14/56)/5=\u221a14/56.\n\nSo, the slope of OC is \u221a14/56. Therefore, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: -56/\u221a14= -56\u221a14/14= -4\u221a14.\n\nSo, the tangent at C has slope -4\u221a14 and passes through C(0,0). So, its equation is y= -4\u221a14 x.\n\nSimilarly, the tangent at B: Let's compute its equation. The radius OB has slope (y_B - y_O)/(x_B - x_O).

The center O is (5, 5\u221a14/56), so the slope of OC is (5\u221a14/56)/5 = \u221a14/56. Therefore, the slope of the tangent at C is -56/\u221a14. Simplify this: -56/\u221a14 = -56\u221a14/14 = -4\u221a14.\n\nSo the tangent at C is a line passing through (0,0) with slope -4\u221a14.

But in this case, I need the equation of the tangent at B and at C.\n\nFirst, let me find the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9 of triangle ABC. Since points A, B, C lie on \u03c9, and we've placed C at (0,0), A at (10,0), and B at (39/5,6\u221a14/5).\n\nThe general equation of a circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx + 2fy + c =0. Since point C(0,0) is on the circle, plugging in: 0 +0 +0 +0 +c=0 \u2192 c=0.\n\nSo, equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx + 2fy=0.\n\nNow, plug in point A(10,0): 100 +0 +20g +0=0 \u2192 20g= -100 \u2192 g= -5.\n\nSo, equation now is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + 2fy=0.\n\nNow, plug in point B(39/5,6\u221a14/5):\n\n(39/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 -10*(39/5) + 2f*(6\u221a14/5) =0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(39/5)^2 = 1521/25.\n\n(6\u221a14/5)^2 = 36*14 /25 = 504/25.\n\n10*(39/5)=78.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n1521/25 + 504/25 -78 + (12\u221a14 f)/5 =0.\n\nCompute 1521 +504=2025, so 2025/25=81.\n\nSo, 81 -78 + (12\u221a14 f)/5 =0 \u2192 3 + (12\u221a14 f)/5=0.\n\nSo, (12\u221a14 f)/5= -3 \u2192 f= (-3 *5)/(12\u221a14) )= (-15)/(12\u221a14)= (-5)/(4\u221a14).\n\nRationalize denominator: (-5\u221a14)/(4*14)= (-5\u221a14)/56.\n\nSo, f= (-5\u221a14)/56.\n\nSo, equation of circle \u03c9 is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + 2*(-5\u221a14/56)y=0 \u2192 x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y=0.\n\nNow, the equation of the tangent at point B(39/5,6\u221a14/5) to circle \u03c9.\n\nThe equation of the tangent at a point (x\u2081,y\u2081) on circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx + 2fy + c =0 is xx\u2081 + yy\u2081 + g(x +x\u2081) + f(y + y\u2081) + c =0.\n\nSince our circle equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y=0, so 2g= -10 \u2192 g= -5, 2f= -5\u221a14/28 \u2192 f= -5\u221a14/(56).\n\nSo, the tangent at B(39/5,6\u221a14/5):\n\nx*(39/5) + y*(6\u221a14/5) + (-5)(x +39/5) + (-5\u221a14/56)(y +6\u221a14/5) =0.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (39/5)x + (6\u221a14/5)y.\n\nSecond term: -5x -5*(39/5)= -5x -39.\n\nThird term: (-5\u221a14/56)(y +6\u221a14/5) = (-5\u221a14/56)y - (5\u221a14/56)*(6\u221a14/5).\n\nSimplify the third term:\n\nFirst part: (-5\u221a14/56)y.\n\nSecond part: [5\u221a14 *6\u221a14 ]/(56*5) = [5*6*(\u221a14)^2]/(280) = (30*14)/280 = 420/280=3/2.",

          "text2": "Wait, no, slope of tangent is negative reciprocal of slope of OB.\n\nSo slope of OB is (y_B - y_O)/(x_B - x_O) = [ (6\u221a14/5 - 5\u221a14/56) ] / (39/5 -5) = as I computed earlier, (311\u221a14/280)/(14/5) )= (311\u221a14/280) * (5/14) )= 311\u221a14/(280*14/5) )= 311\u221a14/( (280/5)*14 )= 311\u221a14/(56*14)= 311\u221a14/(784).\n\nSo slope of tangent is -784/(311\u221a14). Rationalizing, multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14:\n\n-784\u221a14/(311*14) = (-784/14)*\u221a14/311 = (-56)*\u221a14/311. So slope of tangent at B is (-56\u221a14)/311.\n\nSimilarly, the tangent at C is another line. Since C is at (0,0), and the tangent at C is perpendicular to the radius OC. The center O is (5, 5\u221a14/56), so the slope of OC is (5\u221a14/56)/5 = \u221a14/56. Therefore, the slope of the tangent at C is -56/\u221a14. Simplify this: -56/\u221a14 = -56\u221a14/14 = -4\u221a14.\n\nSo the tangent at C is a line passing through (0,0) with slope -4\u221a14. So its equation is y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\nSimilarly, the tangent at B is a line with slope (-56\u221a14)/311 passing through point B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5). So its equation is y - 6\u221a14/5 = [ (-56\u221a14)/311 ] (x - 39/5).\n\nNow, point D is the intersection of the two tangents. So we can find D by solving the two equations:\n\n1. y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\n2. y = [ (-56\u221a14)/311 ] (x - 39/5 ) + 6\u221a14/5.\n\nLet me substitute equation 1 into equation 2.\n\n-4\u221a14 x = [ (-56\u221a14)/311 ] (x - 39/5 ) + 6\u221a14/5.\n\nLet me divide both sides by \u221a14 to simplify:\n\n-4x = [ (-56)/311 ] (x - 39/5 ) + 6/5.\n\nMultiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-4x * 311 = -56(x - 39/5) + (6/5)*311.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nLeft side: -1244 x.\n\nRight side: -56x + (56 * 39)/5 + (6 * 311)/5.\n\nCompute 56 * 39: 56*40=2240, minus 56=2184. So 2184/5.\n\n6*311=1866. So 1866/5.\n\nSo right side: -56x + 2184/5 + 1866/5 = -56x + (2184 + 1866)/5 = -56x + 4050/5 = -56x + 810.\n\nSo now equation is:\n\n-1244x = -56x + 810.\n\nBring -56x to the left:\n\n-1244x +56x = 810 \u21d2 (-1188)x = 810 \u21d2 x = 810 / (-1188).\n\nSimplify fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 18: 810 \u00f718=45, 1188 \u00f718=66.\n\nSo x= -45/66. Simplify further by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: -15/22.\n\nSo x coordinate of D is -15/22.\n\nThen, from equation 1, y = -4\u221a14 x = -4\u221a14*(-15/22) = (60\u221a14)/22 = (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, I need to find point P where line AD intersects the circumcircle again. Since A is at (10,0) and D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11), let me find the parametric equation of line AD.\n\nParametrize AD with parameter t. Let me write it as:\n\nx = 10 + t*(-15/22 -10) = 10 + t*(-235/22).\n\ny = 0 + t*(30\u221a14/11 -0) = t*(30\u221a14/11).\n\nSo x = 10 - (235/22)t.\n\ny = (30\u221a14/11) t.\n\nWe need to find the value of t where this parametric line intersects the circumcircle again. Since A is on both the line and the circle, t=0 corresponds to A, and t=T corresponds to P.\n\nPlug x and y into the circle equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + Ey =0.",

So, its slope is the negative reciprocal: -784/(311\u221a14).\n\nRationalize the denominator: -784/(311\u221a14) = -784\u221a14/(311*14) = -56\u221a14/311.\n\nSo, the tangent at B has slope -56\u221a14/311.\n\nNow, the tangent at B passes through point B(39/5,6\u221a14/5). So, the equation is:\n\ny - 6\u221a14/5 = (-56\u221a14/311)(x -39/5).\n\nNow, we have two equations for the two tangents:\n\n1. Tangent at C: y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\n2.

Now, we need to find the equation of line AD, then find its intersection with the circumcircle \u03c9, which is point P.\n\nPoint A is at (10,0), and point D is at (-15/22,30\u221a14/11). Let's compute the equation of line AD.\n\nFirst, find the slope of AD.\n\nSlope m_AD= (y_D - y_A)/(x_D - x_A) = (30\u221a14/11 -0)/( -15/22 -10 ).\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n-15/22 -10 = -15/22 -220/22 = (-235)/22.\n\nSo, slope m_AD= (30\u221a14/11)/(-235/22)= (30\u221a14/11)*( -22/235 )= (30\u221a14 * (-22))/(11*235).\n\nSimplify:\n\n30 and 235: 235=5*47, 30=5*6. So, 30/235=6/47.\n\nSimilarly, 22 and 11: 22/11=2.\n\nSo, m_AD= (30\u221a14 * (-22))/(11*235) = ( (30/235)*(22/11) )*(-\u221a14).\n\nWhich becomes (6/47 * 2)*(-\u221a14)= (12/47)*(-\u221a14)= -12\u221a14/47.\n\nSo, slope m_AD= -12\u221a14/47.\n\nNow, equation of line AD: using point A(10,0):\n\ny -0 = m_AD*(x -10) \u2192 y= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nWe need to find the other intersection point P of line AD with the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nWe already know that A is on \u03c9 and on AD, so P is the other point.\n\nSo, to find P, we can solve the equation of line AD together with the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nFirst, equation of \u03c9: since it's the circumcircle of triangle ABC, and we have three points on it. But since we know the center is O(5,5\u221a14/56), and radius R=75\u221a14/56.\n\nSo, equation of \u03c9 is (x -5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n(x -5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n(75\u221a14)^2 = 75^2 *14=5625*14=78750.\n\nDenominator:56^2=3136.\n\nSo, right side is 78750/3136.\n\nNow, equation of line AD is y= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nLet me substitute this into the equation of \u03c9.\n\nSo, substitute y = (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10) into the circle equation.\n\nLet me denote m = -12\u221a14/47 for simplicity.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(x -5)^2 + (m(x -10) -5\u221a14/56)^2 = 78750/3136.\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\nFirst term: (x -5)^2 = x\u00b2 -10x +25.\n\nSecond term: [ m(x -10) -5\u221a14/56 ]^2.\n\nLet me compute m(x-10):\n\nm(x-10) = (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n(-12\u221a14/47)(x -10) -5\u221a14/56.\n\nLet me factor out \u221a14:\n\n\u221a14 [ (-12/47)(x -10) -5/(56) ].\n\nSo, the square is:\n\n14 * [ (-12/47)(x -10) -5/56 ]^2.\n\nSo, the second term is 14 * [ (-12/47)(x -10) -5/56 ]^2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the equation is:\n\n(x\u00b2 -10x +25) +14*[ (-12/47 (x -10) -5/56 ) ]^2 = 78750/3136.\n\nThis looks a bit messy, but perhaps we can simplify step by step.\n\nLet me denote t = x.\n\nCompute the expression inside the square brackets:\n\n(-12/47)(t -10) -5/56.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nLet me find a common denominator for the coefficients. 47 and 56 are coprime, so the LCD is 47*56=2632.\n\nSo, write each term with denominator 2632.\n\n-12/47 = (-12*56)/2632 = (-672)/2632.\n\n-5/56= (-5*47)/2632 = (-235)/2632.\n\nSo, (-12/47)(t -10) = (-672/2632)(t -10).\n\nSo, the entire expression becomes:\n\n(-672/2632)(t -10) -235/2632 = [ -672(t -10) -235 ] /2632.\n\nSo, the expression is [ -672t +6720 -235 ] /2632 = [ -672t +6485 ] /2632.\n\nTherefore, the second term is 14 * [ (-672t +6485)/2632 ]^2.\n\nWhich is 14*( (-672t +6485)^2 )/(2632^2).\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nt\u00b2 -10t +25 +14*( (-672t +6485)^2 )/(2632\u00b2) = 78750/3136.\n\nThis seems very complicated.

So, the equation is x = 5.\n\nSo now, we have two perpendicular bisectors: x = 5 and the other one which is y - 3\u221a14/5 = (11\u221a14)/84 (x - 89/10).\n\nLet me solve these two equations to find the circumcenter O.\n\nSubstitute x =5 into the second equation:\n\ny - 3\u221a14/5 = (11\u221a14)/84 (5 - 89/10)\n\nCompute 5 - 89/10: 5 is 50/10, so 50/10 -89/10 = (-39/10)\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\ny = 3\u221a14/5 + (11\u221a14)/84 * (-39/10)\n\nCompute the second term:\n\n(11\u221a14)/84 * (-39/10) = (-429\u221a14)/840 = Simplify numerator and denominator by 3: (-143\u221a14)/280.\n\nSo, y = 3\u221a14/5 - 143\u221a14/280.\n\nConvert 3\u221a14/5 to denominator 280: 3\u221a14/5 = (3\u221a14 *56)/280 = 168\u221a14/280.\n\nSo, y = (168\u221a14 - 143\u221a14)/280 = (25\u221a14)/280 = (5\u221a14)/56.\n\nThus, the circumcenter O is at (5, 5\u221a14/56).\n\nNow, O is at (5, 5\u221a14/56).

Let's see, 5 divides both: 1555/5=311, 3920/5=784. So, (311\u221a14)/784.\n\nSo, slope of OB is (311\u221a14)/784.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the tangent at B is the negative reciprocal: -784/(311\u221a14).\n\nSimplify that: rationalize the denominator:\n\n-784/(311\u221a14) = (-784\u221a14)/(311*14) = (-784\u221a14)/(4354) = can we reduce this fraction?\n\n784 and 4354: 784 divides by 14: 784=14*56, 4354 divided by 14: 4354 /14 = 311.\n\nSo, 784/4354 = 56/311.\n\nSo, slope of tangent at B is (-56\u221a14)/311.\n\nSimilarly, the tangent at C: since point C is at (0,0), and O is at (5,5\u221a14/56). So, the slope of OC is (5\u221a14/56 -0)/(5 -0) = (5\u221a14)/280 = \u221a14/56.\n\nSo, the slope of tangent at C is the negative reciprocal: -56/\u221a14 = -56\u221a14/14 = -4\u221a14.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at C has slope -4\u221a14.\n\nSo, now we have equations of the two tangents: tangent at B and tangent at C.

So, x = -45/66 = -15/22.\n\nSo, x = -15/22.\n\nNow, substitute back into y = -4\u221a14 x: y = -4\u221a14*(-15/22) = (60\u221a14)/22 = (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo, point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, we need to find line AD and its intersection with \u03c9 again at point P.\n\nFirst, find the equation of line AD.\n\nPoint A is at (10,0), point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nCompute the slope of AD:\n\nm = (30\u221a14/11 - 0)/(-15/22 -10) = (30\u221a14/11) / (-15/22 - 220/22) = (30\u221a14/11) / (-235/22) = (30\u221a14/11) * (-22/235) = (-60\u221a14)/235 = simplify numerator and denominator.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: (-12\u221a14)/47.\n\nSo, slope m = -12\u221a14/47.\n\nEquation of AD: using point A (10,0):\n\ny -0 = m(x -10) \u2192 y = (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nWe need to find the other intersection point P of AD with \u03c9.\n\nWe already know that A is on \u03c9 and AD, so P is the other point.\n\nWe can parametrize line AD and find its other intersection with \u03c9.",

Since points A(10,0), B(39/5,6\u221a14/5), and C(0,0) lie on it, I can find the equation.\n\nGeneral equation of circle: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx + 2fy + c =0.\n\nSince point C (0,0) is on the circle: 0 +0 +0 +0 +c=0 => c=0.\n\nSo equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx + 2fy =0.\n\nNow, plug in point A(10,0):\n\n10\u00b2 +0 +2g*10 +2f*0=0 => 100 +20g=0 => 20g= -100 => g= -5.\n\nSo, equation now: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + 2fy=0.\n\nNow, plug in point B(39/5,6\u221a14/5):\n\n(39/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 -10*(39/5) +2f*(6\u221a14/5) =0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(39/5)^2 = 1521/25\n\n(6\u221a14/5)^2=36*14/25=504/25\n\n10*(39/5)= 78\n\nSo,\n\n1521/25 +504/25 -78 + (12f\u221a14)/5 =0.\n\nCombine the first two terms:\n\n(1521 +504)/25 =2025/25=81.\n\nSo,\n\n81 -78 + (12f\u221a14)/5 =0\n\nSimplify: 3 + (12f\u221a14)/5=0\n\nSo,\n\n(12f\u221a14)/5 = -3\n\nMultiply both sides by 5:\n\n12f\u221a14= -15\n\nDivide both sides by 12\u221a14:\n\nf= (-15)/(12\u221a14)= (-5)/(4\u221a14). Rationalize denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14:\n\nf= (-5\u221a14)/(4*14)= (-5\u221a14)/56.\n\nSo, f= -5\u221a14/56.\n\nTherefore, the equation of circle \u03c9 is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x +2*(-5\u221a14/56)y=0.\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (10\u221a14/56)y=0.\n\nSimplify 10\u221a14/56: 10/56=5/28, so 5\u221a14/28.\n\nSo, equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y =0.\n\nNow, to find the equation of tangent at point B(39/5,6\u221a14/5). The equation of tangent to a circle at a point (x\u2081,y\u2081) is xx\u2081 + yy\u2081 + g(x +x\u2081) + f(y + y\u2081) + c =0.",

Common factor 7.\n\nSo, divide numerator and denominator by 7: 105/7=15, 154/7=22.\n\nSo, simplified fraction is -15/22.\n\nThus, x= -15/22.\n\nNow, find y from tangent at C: y= -4\u221a14 x = -4\u221a14*(-15/22)= (60\u221a14)/22= (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo, point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, find equation of line AD. Points A(10,0) and D(-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nCompute the slope of AD: (30\u221a14/11 -0)/(-15/22 -10) = (30\u221a14/11)/(-15/22 -220/22)= (30\u221a14/11)/(-235/22 )= (30\u221a14/11)*( -22/235 )= (30\u221a14 * (-22))/(11*235).\n\nSimplify:\n\n30 and 235: 30=2*3*5, 235=5*47.

Then, plug into equation 2: (39/5)^2 + y^2 =81.\n\nCompute (39/5)^2: 39^2=1521, so (1521)/(25) + y^2=81 => y^2=81 - (1521/25) = (2025/25 -1521/25)=504/25. So y= sqrt(504/25)=sqrt(504)/5= (6*sqrt(14))/5. So y= (6\u221a14)/5.\n\nSo, point B has coordinates (39/5, (6\u221a14)/5).

So, 1555\u221a14/3920 = (311\u221a14)/784.\n\nBut 311 is a prime number, I think. So, the slope of OB is (311\u221a14)/784.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB. So, its slope is the negative reciprocal: -784/(311\u221a14).\n\nRationalize the denominator: -784/(311\u221a14) = -784\u221a14/(311*14) = -56\u221a14/311.\n\nSo, the tangent at B has slope -56\u221a14/311.\n\nNow, the tangent at B passes through point B(39/5,6\u221a14/5). So, the equation is:\n\ny - 6\u221a14/5 = (-56\u221a14/311)(x -39/5).\n\nNow, we have two equations for the two tangents:\n\n1. Tangent at C: y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\n2. Tangent at B: y = (-56\u221a14/311)(x -39/5) +6\u221a14/5.\n\nWe need to find their intersection point D.\n\nSo, set the two equations equal:\n\n-4\u221a14 x = (-56\u221a14/311)(x -39/5) +6\u221a14/5.\n\nLet me divide both sides by \u221a14 to simplify:\n\n-4x = (-56/311)(x -39/5) +6/5.\n\nNow, let's simplify this equation.\n\nMultiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-4x *311 = -56(x -39/5) + (6/5)*311.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nLeft side: -1244x.\n\nRight side: -56x + (56*39)/5 + (6*311)/5.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n56*39: 56*(40-1)=2240 -56=2184.\n\n56*39=2184.\n\nSo, -56x + 2184/5 + (6*311)/5.\n\n6*311=1866.\n\nSo, -56x + (2184 +1866)/5 = -56x +4050/5 = -56x +810.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n-1244x = -56x +810.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-1244x +56x -810 =0 \u2192 (-1188x) -810=0 \u2192 -1188x=810 \u2192 x=810/(-1188)= -810/1188.\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 9: 810 \u00f79=90, 1188 \u00f79=132.\n\nSo, x= -90/132.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 6: 90 \u00f76=15, 132 \u00f76=22.\n\nSo, x= -15/22.\n\nTherefore, x= -15/22.\n\nNow, substitute x into tangent at C to find y:\n\ny= -4\u221a14 x = -4\u221a14*(-15/22)= (60\u221a14)/22= (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo, point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nAlright, now we have point D(-15/22,30\u221a14/11). Now, we need to find the equation of line AD, then find its intersection with the circumcircle \u03c9, which is point P.\n\nPoint A is at (10,0), and point D is at (-15/22,30\u221a14/11). Let's compute the equation of line AD.\n\nFirst, find the slope of AD.\n\nSlope m_AD= (y_D - y_A)/(x_D - x_A) = (30\u221a14/11 -0)/( -15/22 -10 ).\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n-15/22 -10 = -15/22 -220/22 = (-235)/22.\n\nSo, slope m_AD= (30\u221a14/11)/(-235/22)= (30\u221a14/11)*( -22/235 )= (30\u221a14 * (-22))/(11*235).\n\nSimplify:\n\n30 and 235: 235=5*47, 30=5*6. So, 30/235=6/47.\n\nSimilarly, 22 and 11: 22/11=2.\n\nSo, m_AD= (30\u221a14 * (-22))/(11*235) = ( (30/235)*(22/11) )*(-\u221a14).\n\nWhich becomes (6/47 * 2)*(-\u221a14)= (12/47)*(-\u221a14)= -12\u221a14/47.\n\nSo, slope m_AD= -12\u221a14/47.\n\nNow, equation of line AD: using point A(10,0):\n\ny -0 = m_AD*(x -10) \u2192 y= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nWe need to find the other intersection point P of line AD with the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nWe already know that A is on \u03c9 and on AD, so P is the other point.\n\nSo, to find P, we can solve the equation of line AD together with the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nFirst, equation of \u03c9: since it's the circumcircle of triangle ABC, and we have three points on it. But since we know the center is O(5,5\u221a14/56), and radius R=75\u221a14/56.\n\nSo, equation of \u03c9 is (x -5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n(x -5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n(75\u221a14)^2 = 75^2 *14=5625*14=78750.\n\nDenominator:56^2=3136.\n\nSo, right side is 78750/3136.\n\nNow, equation of line AD is y= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nLet me substitute this into the equation of \u03c9.\n\nSo, substitute y = (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10) into the circle equation.\n\nLet me denote m = -12\u221a14/47 for simplicity.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(x -5)^2 + (m(x -10) -5\u221a14/56)^2 = 78750/3136.\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\nFirst term: (x -5)^2 = x\u00b2 -10x +25.\n\nSecond term: [ m(x -10) -5\u221a14/56 ]^2.\n\nLet me compute m(x-10):\n\nm(x-10) = (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n(-12\u221a14/47)(x -10) -5\u221a14/56.\n\nLet me factor out \u221a14:\n\n\u221a14 [ (-12/47)(x -10) -5/(56) ].\n\nSo, the square is:\n\n14 * [ (-12/47)(x -10) -5/56 ]^2.\n\nSo, the second term is 14 * [ (-12/47)(x -10) -5/56 ]^2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the equation is:\n\n(x\u00b2 -10x +25) +14*[ (-12/47 (x -10) -5/56 ) ]^2 = 78750/3136.\n\nThis looks a bit messy, but perhaps we can simplify step by step.\n\nLet me denote t = x.\n\nCompute the expression inside the square brackets:\n\n(-12/47)(t -10) -5/56.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nLet me find a common denominator for the coefficients. 47 and 56 are coprime, so the LCD is 47*56=2632.\n\nSo, write each term with denominator 2632.\n\n-12/47 = (-12*56)/2632 = (-672)/2632.\n\n-5/56= (-5*47)/2632 = (-235)/2632.\n\nSo, (-12/47)(t -10) = (-672/2632)(t -10).\n\nSo, the entire expression becomes:\n\n(-672/2632)(t -10) -235/2632 = [ -672(t -10) -235 ] /2632.\n\nSo, the expression is [ -672t +6720 -235 ] /2632 = [ -672t +6485 ] /2632.\n\nTherefore, the second term is 14 * [ (-672t +6485)/2632 ]^2.\n\nWhich is 14*( (-672t +6485)^2 )/(2632^2).\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nt\u00b2 -10t +25 +14*( (-672t +6485)^2 )/(2632\u00b2) = 78750/3136.\n\nThis seems very complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.",

          "text2": "Wait, no, slope of tangent is negative reciprocal of slope of OB.\n\nSo slope of OB is (y_B - y_O)/(x_B - x_O) = [ (6\u221a14/5 - 5\u221a14/56) ] / (39/5 -5) = as I computed earlier, (311\u221a14/280)/(14/5) )= (311\u221a14/280) * (5/14) )= 311\u221a14/(280*14/5) )= 311\u221a14/( (280/5)*14 )= 311\u221a14/(56*14)= 311\u221a14/(784).\n\nSo slope of tangent is -784/(311\u221a14). Rationalizing, multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14:\n\n-784\u221a14/(311*14) = (-784/14)*\u221a14/311 = (-56)*\u221a14/311. So slope of tangent at B is (-56\u221a14)/311.\n\nSimilarly, the tangent at C is another line. Since C is at (0,0), and the tangent at C is perpendicular to the radius OC. The center O is (5, 5\u221a14/56), so the slope of OC is (5\u221a14/56)/5 = \u221a14/56. Therefore, the slope of the tangent at C is -56/\u221a14. Simplify this: -56/\u221a14 = -56\u221a14/14 = -4\u221a14.\n\nSo the tangent at C is a line passing through (0,0) with slope -4\u221a14. So its equation is y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\nSimilarly, the tangent at B is a line with slope (-56\u221a14)/311 passing through point B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5). So its equation is y - 6\u221a14/5 = [ (-56\u221a14)/311 ] (x - 39/5).\n\nNow, point D is the intersection of the two tangents. So we can find D by solving the two equations:\n\n1. y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\n2. y = [ (-56\u221a14)/311 ] (x - 39/5 ) + 6\u221a14/5.\n\nLet me substitute equation 1 into equation 2.\n\n-4\u221a14 x = [ (-56\u221a14)/311 ] (x - 39/5 ) + 6\u221a14/5.\n\nLet me divide both sides by \u221a14 to simplify:\n\n-4x = [ (-56)/311 ] (x - 39/5 ) + 6/5.\n\nMultiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-4x * 311 = -56(x - 39/5) + (6/5)*311.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nLeft side: -1244 x.\n\nRight side: -56x + (56 * 39)/5 + (6 * 311)/5.\n\nCompute 56 * 39: 56*40=2240, minus 56=2184. So 2184/5.\n\n6*311=1866. So 1866/5.\n\nSo right side: -56x + 2184/5 + 1866/5 = -56x + (2184 + 1866)/5 = -56x + 4050/5 = -56x + 810.\n\nSo now equation is:\n\n-1244x = -56x + 810.\n\nBring -56x to the left:\n\n-1244x +56x = 810 \u21d2 (-1188)x = 810 \u21d2 x = 810 / (-1188).\n\nSimplify fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 18: 810 \u00f718=45, 1188 \u00f718=66.\n\nSo x= -45/66. Simplify further by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: -15/22.\n\nSo x coordinate of D is -15/22.\n\nThen, from equation 1, y = -4\u221a14 x = -4\u221a14*(-15/22) = (60\u221a14)/22 = (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, I need to find point P where line AD intersects the circumcircle again. Since A is at (10,0) and D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11), let me find the parametric equation of line AD.\n\nParametrize AD with parameter t. Let me write it as:\n\nx = 10 + t*(-15/22 -10) = 10 + t*(-235/22).\n\ny = 0 + t*(30\u221a14/11 -0) = t*(30\u221a14/11).\n\nSo x = 10 - (235/22)t.\n\ny = (30\u221a14/11) t.\n\nWe need to find the value of t where this parametric line intersects the circumcircle again. Since A is on both the line and the circle, t=0 corresponds to A, and t=T corresponds to P.\n\nPlug x and y into the circle equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + Ey =0.",

Since point C(0,0) is on the circle, plugging in: 0 +0 +0 +0 +c=0 \u2192 c=0.\n\nSo, equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx + 2fy=0.\n\nNow, plug in point A(10,0): 100 +0 +20g +0=0 \u2192 20g= -100 \u2192 g= -5.\n\nSo, equation now is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + 2fy=0.\n\nNow, plug in point B(39/5,6\u221a14/5):\n\n(39/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 -10*(39/5) + 2f*(6\u221a14/5) =0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(39/5)^2 = 1521/25.\n\n(6\u221a14/5)^2 = 36*14 /25 = 504/25.\n\n10*(39/5)=78.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n1521/25 + 504/25 -78 + (12\u221a14 f)/5 =0.\n\nCompute 1521 +504=2025, so 2025/25=81.\n\nSo, 81 -78 + (12\u221a14 f)/5 =0 \u2192 3 + (12\u221a14 f)/5=0.\n\nSo, (12\u221a14 f)/5= -3 \u2192 f= (-3 *5)/(12\u221a14) )= (-15)/(12\u221a14)= (-5)/(4\u221a14).\n\nRationalize denominator: (-5\u221a14)/(4*14)= (-5\u221a14)/56.\n\nSo, f= (-5\u221a14)/56.\n\nSo, equation of circle \u03c9 is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + 2*(-5\u221a14/56)y=0 \u2192 x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y=0.\n\nNow, the equation of the tangent at point B(39/5,6\u221a14/5) to circle \u03c9.\n\nThe equation of the tangent at a point (x\u2081,y\u2081) on circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx + 2fy + c =0 is xx\u2081 + yy\u2081 + g(x +x\u2081) + f(y + y\u2081) + c =0.\n\nSince our circle equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y=0, so 2g= -10 \u2192 g= -5, 2f= -5\u221a14/28 \u2192 f= -5\u221a14/(56).\n\nSo, the tangent at B(39/5,6\u221a14/5):\n\nx*(39/5) + y*(6\u221a14/5) + (-5)(x +39/5) + (-5\u221a14/56)(y +6\u221a14/5) =0.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (39/5)x + (6\u221a14/5)y.\n\nSecond term: -5x -5*(39/5)= -5x -39.\n\nThird term: (-5\u221a14/56)(y +6\u221a14/5) = (-5\u221a14/56)y - (5\u221a14/56)*(6\u221a14/5).\n\nSimplify the third term:\n\nFirst part: (-5\u221a14/56)y.\n\nSecond part: [5\u221a14 *6\u221a14 ]/(56*5) = [5*6*(\u221a14)^2]/(280) = (30*14)/280 = 420/280=3/2.",

Let's compute the equation of line AD.\n\nFirst, find the slope of AD.\n\nSlope m_AD= (y_D - y_A)/(x_D - x_A) = (30\u221a14/11 -0)/( -15/22 -10 ).\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n-15/22 -10 = -15/22 -220/22 = (-235)/22.\n\nSo, slope m_AD= (30\u221a14/11)/(-235/22)= (30\u221a14/11)*( -22/235 )= (30\u221a14 * (-22))/(11*235).\n\nSimplify:\n\n30 and 235: 235=5*47, 30=5*6. So, 30/235=6/47.\n\nSimilarly, 22 and 11: 22/11=2.\n\nSo, m_AD= (30\u221a14 * (-22))/(11*235) = ( (30/235)*(22/11) )*(-\u221a14).\n\nWhich becomes (6/47 * 2)*(-\u221a14)= (12/47)*(-\u221a14)= -12\u221a14/47.\n\nSo, slope m_AD= -12\u221a14/47.\n\nNow, equation of line AD: using point A(10,0):\n\ny -0 = m_AD*(x -10) \u2192 y= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nWe need to find the other intersection point P of line AD with the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nWe already know that A is on \u03c9 and on AD, so P is the other point.\n\nSo, to find P, we can solve the equation of line AD together with the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nFirst, equation of \u03c9: since it's the circumcircle of triangle ABC, and we have three points on it. But since we know the center is O(5,5\u221a14/56), and radius R=75\u221a14/56.\n\nSo, equation of \u03c9 is (x -5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n(x -5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n(75\u221a14)^2 = 75^2 *14=5625*14=78750.\n\nDenominator:56^2=3136.\n\nSo, right side is 78750/3136.\n\nNow, equation of line AD is y= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nLet me substitute this into the equation of \u03c9.\n\nSo, substitute y = (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10) into the circle equation.\n\nLet me denote m = -12\u221a14/47 for simplicity.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(x -5)^2 + (m(x -10) -5\u221a14/56)^2 = 78750/3136.\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\nFirst term: (x -5)^2 = x\u00b2 -10x +25.\n\nSecond term: [ m(x -10) -5\u221a14/56 ]^2.\n\nLet me compute m(x-10):\n\nm(x-10) = (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n(-12\u221a14/47)(x -10) -5\u221a14/56.\n\nLet me factor out \u221a14:\n\n\u221a14 [ (-12/47)(x -10) -5/(56) ].\n\nSo, the square is:\n\n14 * [ (-12/47)(x -10) -5/56 ]^2.\n\nSo, the second term is 14 * [ (-12/47)(x -10) -5/56 ]^2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the equation is:\n\n(x\u00b2 -10x +25) +14*[ (-12/47 (x -10) -5/56 ) ]^2 = 78750/3136.\n\nThis looks a bit messy, but perhaps we can simplify step by step.\n\nLet me denote t = x.\n\nCompute the expression inside the square brackets:\n\n(-12/47)(t -10) -5/56.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nLet me find a common denominator for the coefficients. 47 and 56 are coprime, so the LCD is 47*56=2632.\n\nSo, write each term with denominator 2632.\n\n-12/47 = (-12*56)/2632 = (-672)/2632.\n\n-5/56= (-5*47)/2632 = (-235)/2632.\n\nSo, (-12/47)(t -10) = (-672/2632)(t -10).\n\nSo, the entire expression becomes:\n\n(-672/2632)(t -10) -235/2632 = [ -672(t -10) -235 ] /2632.\n\nSo, the expression is [ -672t +6720 -235 ] /2632 = [ -672t +6485 ] /2632.\n\nTherefore, the second term is 14 * [ (-672t +6485)/2632 ]^2.\n\nWhich is 14*( (-672t +6485)^2 )/(2632^2).\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nt\u00b2 -10t +25 +14*( (-672t +6485)^2 )/(2632\u00b2) = 78750/3136.\n\nThis seems very complicated.

Plugging in point C(0,0): 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0 \u21d2 F = 0.\n\nSo equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey = 0.\n\nPlugging in point A(10,0): 100 + 0 + 10D + 0 = 0 \u21d2 10D = -100 \u21d2 D = -10.\n\nSo equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + Ey = 0.\n\nNow, plugging in point B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5):\n\n(39/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 -10*(39/5) + E*(6\u221a14/5) = 0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(39/5)^2 = (1521)/25.\n\n(6\u221a14/5)^2 = (36 * 14)/25 = (504)/25.\n\n-10*(39/5) = -78.\n\nE*(6\u221a14/5) is (6\u221a14 E)/5.\n\nSo overall:\n\n1521/25 + 504/25 - 78 + (6\u221a14 E)/5 = 0.\n\nCombine the fractions: (1521 + 504)/25 = 2025/25 = 81.\n\nSo equation becomes: 81 -78 + (6\u221a14 E)/5 = 0 \u21d2 3 + (6\u221a14 E)/5 =0 \u21d2 (6\u221a14 E)/5 = -3 \u21d2 E = (-3 *5)/(6\u221a14) = (-15)/(6\u221a14) = (-5)/(2\u221a14).\n\nRationalizing the denominator: (-5\u221a14)/(2*14) = (-5\u221a14)/28.\n\nSo the equation of the circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + (-5\u221a14/28)y = 0.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy, but let's proceed.\n\nNow, to find the tangent at point B. The tangent to the circle at point (x\u2081, y\u2081) is given by:\n\nx x\u2081 + y y\u2081 + D*(x + x\u2081)/2 + E*(y + y\u2081)/2 + F = 0.",

(x -10)^2 + y^2 = 25\n2. x^2 + y^2 = 81\n\nSubtract equation 2 from equation 1:\n\n(x -10)^2 + y^2 - x^2 - y^2 = 25 -81 \u2192 (x\u00b2 -20x +100) - x\u00b2 = -56 \u2192 -20x +100 = -56 \u2192 -20x = -156 \u2192 x = 156 /20 = 39/5 = 7.8.\n\nSo, x = 7.8, which is 39/5. Then, plug back into equation 2 to find y:\n\n(39/5)^2 + y^2 =81 \u2192 (1521/25) + y^2 =81 \u2192 y^2 =81 - 1521/25 = (2025 -1521)/25 = 504/25 \u2192 y= sqrt(504)/5 = (6\u221a14)/5.\n\nSo, point B is at (39/5, 6\u221a14/5). Okay, now I have coordinates for A(10,0), B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5), C(0,0).\n\nNow, let's find the equations for the tangents at B and C. Tangent at B and tangent at C intersect at D.\n\nTo find the tangent to a circle at a point, we can use the formula that the tangent is perpendicular to the radius at that point.\n\nBut first, we need the center of the circle \u03c9, which is the circumcircle of triangle ABC.\n\nWe can find the circumcenter O by finding the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC.\n\nBut since we have coordinates for A, B, and C, perhaps we can compute O.",

So, 1555\u221a14/3920 = (311\u221a14)/784.\n\nBut 311 is a prime number, I think. So, the slope of OB is (311\u221a14)/784.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB. So, its slope is the negative reciprocal: -784/(311\u221a14).\n\nRationalize the denominator: -784/(311\u221a14) = -784\u221a14/(311*14) = -56\u221a14/311.\n\nSo, the tangent at B has slope -56\u221a14/311.\n\nNow, the tangent at B passes through point B(39/5,6\u221a14/5). So, the equation is:\n\ny - 6\u221a14/5 = (-56\u221a14/311)(x -39/5).\n\nNow, we have two equations for the two tangents:\n\n1. Tangent at C: y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\n2. Tangent at B: y = (-56\u221a14/311)(x -39/5) +6\u221a14/5.\n\nWe need to find their intersection point D.\n\nSo, set the two equations equal:\n\n-4\u221a14 x = (-56\u221a14/311)(x -39/5) +6\u221a14/5.\n\nLet me divide both sides by \u221a14 to simplify:\n\n-4x = (-56/311)(x -39/5) +6/5.\n\nNow, let's simplify this equation.\n\nMultiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-4x *311 = -56(x -39/5) + (6/5)*311.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nLeft side: -1244x.\n\nRight side: -56x + (56*39)/5 + (6*311)/5.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n56*39: 56*(40-1)=2240 -56=2184.\n\n56*39=2184.\n\nSo, -56x + 2184/5 + (6*311)/5.\n\n6*311=1866.\n\nSo, -56x + (2184 +1866)/5 = -56x +4050/5 = -56x +810.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n-1244x = -56x +810.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-1244x +56x -810 =0 \u2192 (-1188x) -810=0 \u2192 -1188x=810 \u2192 x=810/(-1188)= -810/1188.\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 9: 810 \u00f79=90, 1188 \u00f79=132.\n\nSo, x= -90/132.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 6: 90 \u00f76=15, 132 \u00f76=22.\n\nSo, x= -15/22.\n\nTherefore, x= -15/22.\n\nNow, substitute x into tangent at C to find y:\n\ny= -4\u221a14 x = -4\u221a14*(-15/22)= (60\u221a14)/22= (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo, point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nAlright, now we have point D(-15/22,30\u221a14/11). Now, we need to find the equation of line AD, then find its intersection with the circumcircle \u03c9, which is point P.\n\nPoint A is at (10,0), and point D is at (-15/22,30\u221a14/11). Let's compute the equation of line AD.\n\nFirst, find the slope of AD.\n\nSlope m_AD= (y_D - y_A)/(x_D - x_A) = (30\u221a14/11 -0)/( -15/22 -10 ).\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n-15/22 -10 = -15/22 -220/22 = (-235)/22.\n\nSo, slope m_AD= (30\u221a14/11)/(-235/22)= (30\u221a14/11)*( -22/235 )= (30\u221a14 * (-22))/(11*235).\n\nSimplify:\n\n30 and 235: 235=5*47, 30=5*6. So, 30/235=6/47.\n\nSimilarly, 22 and 11: 22/11=2.\n\nSo, m_AD= (30\u221a14 * (-22))/(11*235) = ( (30/235)*(22/11) )*(-\u221a14).\n\nWhich becomes (6/47 * 2)*(-\u221a14)= (12/47)*(-\u221a14)= -12\u221a14/47.\n\nSo, slope m_AD= -12\u221a14/47.\n\nNow, equation of line AD: using point A(10,0):\n\ny -0 = m_AD*(x -10) \u2192 y= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nWe need to find the other intersection point P of line AD with the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nWe already know that A is on \u03c9 and on AD, so P is the other point.\n\nSo, to find P, we can solve the equation of line AD together with the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nFirst, equation of \u03c9: since it's the circumcircle of triangle ABC, and we have three points on it. But since we know the center is O(5,5\u221a14/56), and radius R=75\u221a14/56.\n\nSo, equation of \u03c9 is (x -5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n(x -5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n(75\u221a14)^2 = 75^2 *14=5625*14=78750.\n\nDenominator:56^2=3136.\n\nSo, right side is 78750/3136.\n\nNow, equation of line AD is y= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nLet me substitute this into the equation of \u03c9.\n\nSo, substitute y = (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10) into the circle equation.\n\nLet me denote m = -12\u221a14/47 for simplicity.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(x -5)^2 + (m(x -10) -5\u221a14/56)^2 = 78750/3136.\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\nFirst term: (x -5)^2 = x\u00b2 -10x +25.\n\nSecond term: [ m(x -10) -5\u221a14/56 ]^2.\n\nLet me compute m(x-10):\n\nm(x-10) = (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n(-12\u221a14/47)(x -10) -5\u221a14/56.\n\nLet me factor out \u221a14:\n\n\u221a14 [ (-12/47)(x -10) -5/(56) ].\n\nSo, the square is:\n\n14 * [ (-12/47)(x -10) -5/56 ]^2.\n\nSo, the second term is 14 * [ (-12/47)(x -10) -5/56 ]^2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the equation is:\n\n(x\u00b2 -10x +25) +14*[ (-12/47 (x -10) -5/56 ) ]^2 = 78750/3136.\n\nThis looks a bit messy, but perhaps we can simplify step by step.\n\nLet me denote t = x.\n\nCompute the expression inside the square brackets:\n\n(-12/47)(t -10) -5/56.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nLet me find a common denominator for the coefficients. 47 and 56 are coprime, so the LCD is 47*56=2632.\n\nSo, write each term with denominator 2632.\n\n-12/47 = (-12*56)/2632 = (-672)/2632.\n\n-5/56= (-5*47)/2632 = (-235)/2632.\n\nSo, (-12/47)(t -10) = (-672/2632)(t -10).\n\nSo, the entire expression becomes:\n\n(-672/2632)(t -10) -235/2632 = [ -672(t -10) -235 ] /2632.\n\nSo, the expression is [ -672t +6720 -235 ] /2632 = [ -672t +6485 ] /2632.\n\nTherefore, the second term is 14 * [ (-672t +6485)/2632 ]^2.\n\nWhich is 14*( (-672t +6485)^2 )/(2632^2).\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nt\u00b2 -10t +25 +14*( (-672t +6485)^2 )/(2632\u00b2) = 78750/3136.\n\nThis seems very complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.",

So, -56\u221a14/311.\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent at B is -56\u221a14/311.\n\nSimilarly, the tangent at C: since point C is at (0,0), and the radius OC has slope (yC - yO)/(xC - xO) = (0 - 5\u221a14/56)/(0 -5) = (-5\u221a14/56)/(-5) = (5\u221a14)/(56*5) = \u221a14/56.\n\nSo, slope of OC is \u221a14/56. Thus, the tangent at C is perpendicular, so slope is -56/\u221a14.\n\nRationalize: -56/\u221a14 = -56\u221a14/14 = -4\u221a14.\n\nSo, the tangent at C has slope -4\u221a14.\n\nNow, having the slopes of the two tangents at B and C, and points B and C, I can find the equations of these tangents.\n\nEquation of tangent at B: passes through B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5) with slope -56\u221a14/311.\n\nEquation: y - 6\u221a14/5 = (-56\u221a14/311)(x - 39/5).\n\nEquation of tangent at C: passes through C(0,0) with slope -4\u221a14.\n\nEquation: y = (-4\u221a14)x.\n\nNow, to find point D, which is the intersection of the two tangents.\n\nSo, solve the system:\n\n1. y = (-4\u221a14)x.\n\n2. y - 6\u221a14/5 = (-56\u221a14/311)(x - 39/5).\n\nSubstitute equation 1 into equation 2.\n\nSo, (-4\u221a14)x - 6\u221a14/5 = (-56\u221a14/311)(x - 39/5).\n\nLet me factor out \u221a14 on both sides to simplify.\n\nDivide both sides by \u221a14:\n\n-4x - 6/5 = (-56/311)(x - 39/5).\n\nMultiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-4x*311 - (6/5)*311 = -56(x - 39/5).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-4x*311 = -1244x.\n\n- (6/5)*311 = - (6*311)/5 = -1866/5.\n\n-56(x - 39/5) = -56x + (56*39)/5 = -56x + 2184/5.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n-1244x -1866/5 = -56x + 2184/5.\n\nBring all terms to the left side:\n\n-1244x +56x -1866/5 -2184/5 =0.\n\nCompute:\n\n(-1244 +56)x + (-1866 -2184)/5 =0.\n\n-1188x -4050/5 =0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n-1188x -810=0.\n\nSo, -1188x =810.\n\nx=810 / (-1188)= -810/1188.\n\nSimplify: Divide numerator and denominator by 9: 810 \u00f79=90; 1188 \u00f79=132.\n\nSo, x= -90/132= -15/22.\n\nSo, x= -15/22.\n\nThen, from equation 1: y= (-4\u221a14)x = (-4\u221a14)*(-15/22) = (60\u221a14)/22 = 30\u221a14/11.\n\nSo, point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, we need to find the equation of line AD and find its second intersection point P with the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nPoint A is at (10,0), and point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nFirst, find the slope of AD.\n\nSlope m_AD = (30\u221a14/11 - 0)/(-15/22 -10) = (30\u221a14/11)/( -15/22 -220/22 ) = (30\u221a14/11)/( -235/22 ).\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (30\u221a14/11) * (22/-235) = (30\u221a14 *22) / (11*(-235)).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n22/11=2, so numerator becomes 30\u221a14*2=60\u221a14.\n\nDenominator: -235.\n\nSo, slope m_AD=60\u221a14/(-235)= -60\u221a14/235.\n\nSimplify: Divide numerator and denominator by 5: 12\u221a14/(-47)= -12\u221a14/47.\n\nSo, slope of AD is -12\u221a14/47.\n\nNow, equation of AD: passing through A(10,0):\n\ny -0 = (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nSo, y= (-12\u221a14/47)x + 120\u221a14/47.\n\nNow, to find point P, which is the other intersection of AD with the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nWe need the equation of \u03c9. Since we know the center O is at (5,5\u221a14/56) and we can compute the radius.\n\nRadius is the distance from O to A, which is sqrt( (10-5)^2 + (0 -5\u221a14/56)^2 ).\n\nCompute:\n\n(5)^2 + ( -5\u221a14/56 )^2 =25 + (25*14)/(56^2).\n\n25 + (350)/(3136)=25 + 175/1568.\n\nSimplify 175/1568: divide numerator and denominator by 7: 25/224.\n\nSo, radius squared is 25 + 25/224 = (25*224 +25)/224 =25*(224 +1)/224 =25*225/224=5625/224.\n\nSo, equation of \u03c9 is (x-5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 =5625/224.\n\nNow, substitute y from AD into this equation.\n\nSo, substitute y= (-12\u221a14/47)x +120\u221a14/47.\n\nLet me denote y = m x + c, where m= -12\u221a14/47, c=120\u221a14/47.\n\nSo, plug into circle equation:\n\n(x-5)^2 + ( (m x + c) -5\u221a14/56 )^2 =5625/224.\n\nThis will give a quadratic equation in x, which we can solve. We know that x=10 is one solution (point A), so the other solution will give us x-coordinate of P.\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, expand (x-5)^2:\n\n(x^2 -10x +25).\n\nNext, compute (m x + c -5\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nLet me compute the term inside the square:\n\nm x + c -5\u221a14/56 = (-12\u221a14/47)x +120\u221a14/47 -5\u221a14/56.\n\nFactor out \u221a14:\n\n\u221a14[ (-12x/47) + 120/47 -5/(56) ].\n\nCompute the constants:\n\n120/47 -5/56.\n\nFind a common denominator, which is 47*56=2632.\n\n120/47 = (120*56)/2632=6720/2632.\n\n5/56= (5*47)/2632=235/2632.\n\nSo, 6720/2632 -235/2632= (6720 -235)/2632=6485/2632.\n\nSo, the term inside the square is \u221a14 [ (-12x/47) +6485/2632 ].\n\nSo, the square is 14 [ (-12x/47 +6485/2632 ) ]^2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the circle equation substitution:\n\n(x^2 -10x +25) +14*(-12x/47 +6485/2632)^2 =5625/224.\n\nThis looks quite messy, but perhaps I can multiply both sides by 2632^2 to eliminate denominators, but that might be too cumbersome.",

Let me find the coordinates of B.\n\nWe know AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10.\n\nSo, points: A is at (10,0), C is at (0,0). Let me find point B.\n\nLet\u2019s denote B as (x,y). Then, distance from B to C is 9: sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 9 => x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 81.\n\nDistance from B to A is 5: sqrt((x -10)^2 + y\u00b2) = 5 => (x -10)^2 + y\u00b2 = 25.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\n(x -10)^2 + y\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 25 - 81 => (x\u00b2 -20x +100) + y\u00b2 -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = -56 => -20x +100 = -56 => -20x = -156 => x = 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8.\n\nSo, x is 39/5. Then, y\u00b2 = 81 - (39/5)^2.\n\nCompute (39/5)^2: (1521)/25. So, y\u00b2 = 81 - 1521/25.\n\nConvert 81 to 25ths: 81 = 2025/25.\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = (2025 - 1521)/25 = 504/25. So, y = sqrt(504)/5.

So, 1555\u221a14/3920 = (311\u221a14)/784.\n\nBut 311 is a prime number, I think. So, the slope of OB is (311\u221a14)/784.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB. So, its slope is the negative reciprocal: -784/(311\u221a14).\n\nRationalize the denominator: -784/(311\u221a14) = -784\u221a14/(311*14) = -56\u221a14/311.\n\nSo, the tangent at B has slope -56\u221a14/311.\n\nNow, the tangent at B passes through point B(39/5,6\u221a14/5). So, the equation is:\n\ny - 6\u221a14/5 = (-56\u221a14/311)(x -39/5).\n\nNow, we have two equations for the two tangents:\n\n1. Tangent at C: y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\n2. Tangent at B: y = (-56\u221a14/311)(x -39/5) +6\u221a14/5.\n\nWe need to find their intersection point D.\n\nSo, set the two equations equal:\n\n-4\u221a14 x = (-56\u221a14/311)(x -39/5) +6\u221a14/5.\n\nLet me divide both sides by \u221a14 to simplify:\n\n-4x = (-56/311)(x -39/5) +6/5.\n\nNow, let's simplify this equation.\n\nMultiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-4x *311 = -56(x -39/5) + (6/5)*311.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nLeft side: -1244x.\n\nRight side: -56x + (56*39)/5 + (6*311)/5.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n56*39: 56*(40-1)=2240 -56=2184.\n\n56*39=2184.\n\nSo, -56x + 2184/5 + (6*311)/5.\n\n6*311=1866.\n\nSo, -56x + (2184 +1866)/5 = -56x +4050/5 = -56x +810.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n-1244x = -56x +810.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-1244x +56x -810 =0 \u2192 (-1188x) -810=0 \u2192 -1188x=810 \u2192 x=810/(-1188)= -810/1188.\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 9: 810 \u00f79=90, 1188 \u00f79=132.\n\nSo, x= -90/132.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 6: 90 \u00f76=15, 132 \u00f76=22.\n\nSo, x= -15/22.\n\nTherefore, x= -15/22.\n\nNow, substitute x into tangent at C to find y:\n\ny= -4\u221a14 x = -4\u221a14*(-15/22)= (60\u221a14)/22= (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo, point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nAlright, now we have point D(-15/22,30\u221a14/11). Now, we need to find the equation of line AD, then find its intersection with the circumcircle \u03c9, which is point P.\n\nPoint A is at (10,0), and point D is at (-15/22,30\u221a14/11). Let's compute the equation of line AD.\n\nFirst, find the slope of AD.\n\nSlope m_AD= (y_D - y_A)/(x_D - x_A) = (30\u221a14/11 -0)/( -15/22 -10 ).\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n-15/22 -10 = -15/22 -220/22 = (-235)/22.\n\nSo, slope m_AD= (30\u221a14/11)/(-235/22)= (30\u221a14/11)*( -22/235 )= (30\u221a14 * (-22))/(11*235).\n\nSimplify:\n\n30 and 235: 235=5*47, 30=5*6. So, 30/235=6/47.\n\nSimilarly, 22 and 11: 22/11=2.\n\nSo, m_AD= (30\u221a14 * (-22))/(11*235) = ( (30/235)*(22/11) )*(-\u221a14).\n\nWhich becomes (6/47 * 2)*(-\u221a14)= (12/47)*(-\u221a14)= -12\u221a14/47.\n\nSo, slope m_AD= -12\u221a14/47.\n\nNow, equation of line AD: using point A(10,0):\n\ny -0 = m_AD*(x -10) \u2192 y= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nWe need to find the other intersection point P of line AD with the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nWe already know that A is on \u03c9 and on AD, so P is the other point.\n\nSo, to find P, we can solve the equation of line AD together with the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nFirst, equation of \u03c9: since it's the circumcircle of triangle ABC, and we have three points on it. But since we know the center is O(5,5\u221a14/56), and radius R=75\u221a14/56.\n\nSo, equation of \u03c9 is (x -5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n(x -5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n(75\u221a14)^2 = 75^2 *14=5625*14=78750.\n\nDenominator:56^2=3136.\n\nSo, right side is 78750/3136.\n\nNow, equation of line AD is y= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nLet me substitute this into the equation of \u03c9.\n\nSo, substitute y = (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10) into the circle equation.\n\nLet me denote m = -12\u221a14/47 for simplicity.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(x -5)^2 + (m(x -10) -5\u221a14/56)^2 = 78750/3136.\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\nFirst term: (x -5)^2 = x\u00b2 -10x +25.\n\nSecond term: [ m(x -10) -5\u221a14/56 ]^2.\n\nLet me compute m(x-10):\n\nm(x-10) = (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n(-12\u221a14/47)(x -10) -5\u221a14/56.\n\nLet me factor out \u221a14:\n\n\u221a14 [ (-12/47)(x -10) -5/(56) ].\n\nSo, the square is:\n\n14 * [ (-12/47)(x -10) -5/56 ]^2.\n\nSo, the second term is 14 * [ (-12/47)(x -10) -5/56 ]^2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the equation is:\n\n(x\u00b2 -10x +25) +14*[ (-12/47 (x -10) -5/56 ) ]^2 = 78750/3136.\n\nThis looks a bit messy, but perhaps we can simplify step by step.\n\nLet me denote t = x.\n\nCompute the expression inside the square brackets:\n\n(-12/47)(t -10) -5/56.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nLet me find a common denominator for the coefficients. 47 and 56 are coprime, so the LCD is 47*56=2632.\n\nSo, write each term with denominator 2632.\n\n-12/47 = (-12*56)/2632 = (-672)/2632.\n\n-5/56= (-5*47)/2632 = (-235)/2632.\n\nSo, (-12/47)(t -10) = (-672/2632)(t -10).\n\nSo, the entire expression becomes:\n\n(-672/2632)(t -10) -235/2632 = [ -672(t -10) -235 ] /2632.\n\nSo, the expression is [ -672t +6720 -235 ] /2632 = [ -672t +6485 ] /2632.\n\nTherefore, the second term is 14 * [ (-672t +6485)/2632 ]^2.\n\nWhich is 14*( (-672t +6485)^2 )/(2632^2).\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nt\u00b2 -10t +25 +14*( (-672t +6485)^2 )/(2632\u00b2) = 78750/3136.\n\nThis seems very complicated.

Then compute the distance AP.\n\nFirst, let's find the parametric equations or the slope of AD.\n\nCompute the slope first.\n\nSlope m_AD= (y_D - y_A)/(x_D - x_A)= (30\u221a14/11 -0)/( -15/22 -10 ).\n\nCompute denominator: -15/22 -10= -15/22 -220/22= (-235)/22.\n\nSo slope m= (30\u221a14/11)/( -235/22 )= (30\u221a14/11 )*( -22/235 )= (30\u221a14 * (-22)) / (11*235).\n\nSimplify: 30 and 235: 30 and 235 share a factor of 5: 30=5*6, 235=5*47.\n\nSo, 30/5=6, 235/5=47.\n\nSo, (30\u221a14 * (-22))/(11*235)= (6\u221a14*(-22))/(11*47).\n\nSimplify further: 22/11=2.\n\nSo, (6\u221a14*(-2))/(47)= (-12\u221a14)/47.\n\nSo slope m_AD= -12\u221a14/47.\n\nThus, equation of line AD: y -0= m (x -10).\n\nSo, y= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nNow, find intersection P of AD with the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nWe have the equation of the circle: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y =0.\n\nAnd equation of line: y= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nSubstitute y into the circle equation.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + [ (-12\u221a14/47 (x -10) ) ]\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)(-12\u221a14/47 (x -10))=0.\n\nThis will be a quadratic equation in x, which we can solve. Since we know that A is on both the line and the circle, one solution will be x=10, and the other will be x-coordinate of P.\n\nLet me compute term by term.\n\nFirst term: x\u00b2.\n\nSecond term: [ (-12\u221a14/47 (x -10) ) ]\u00b2 = (144*14)/(47\u00b2) (x -10)^2 = (2016)/(2209) (x\u00b2 -20x +100).\n\nThird term: -10x.\n\nFourth term: -(5\u221a14/28)(-12\u221a14/47)(x -10)= (5\u221a14 *12\u221a14)/(28*47) (x -10).\n\nSimplify this term:\n\n5\u221a14 *12\u221a14=60*14=840.\n\nDenominator:28*47=1316.\n\nSo, term becomes 840/(1316) (x -10).\n\nSimplify 840/1316: both divided by 4: 210/329. Can't simplify further.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nx\u00b2 + (2016/2209)(x\u00b2 -20x +100) -10x + (210/329)(x -10)=0.\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nMultiply through by 2209*329 to eliminate denominators.",
