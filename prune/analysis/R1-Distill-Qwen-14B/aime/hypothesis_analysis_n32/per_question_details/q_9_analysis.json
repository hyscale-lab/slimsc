So log_x((25/x)^x) = x * log_x(25/x) =10.\n\nWhich is x*(log_x(25) - log_x(x)) = x*(log_x(25) -1)=10.\n\nSo log_x(25) = (10/x) +1.\n\nSimilarly, from the second equation: log_y(x^{4y})=10.\n\nx^{4y} =x^{4*(25/x)}=x^{100/x}.\n\nSo log_y(x^{100/x}) = (100/x) * log_y(x)=10.\n\nBut log_y(x) =1/log_x(y) = x/10 from earlier.\n\nSo substituting in: (100/x)*(x/10)= (100/x)*(x/10)=100/10=10. Which matches the equation. So that's good.\n\nNow, let's check the first substitution.\n\nWe have log_x(25) = (10/x)+1.\n\nBut log_x(25) is ln(25)/ln(x). Let me see if that equals (10/x)+1.",

But let me double-check by plugging back into the original equations.\n\nLet me assume that xy=25, so y=25/x.\n\nSubstituting back into the first equation: log_x(y^x) =10.\n\ny^x = (25/x)^x. So log_x((25/x)^x) = x * log_x(25/x) =10.\n\nWhich is x*(log_x(25) - log_x(x)) = x*(log_x(25) -1)=10.\n\nSo log_x(25) = (10/x) +1.\n\nSimilarly, from the second equation: log_y(x^{4y})=10.\n\nx^{4y} =x^{4*(25/x)}=x^{100/x}.\n\nSo log_y(x^{100/x}) = (100/x) * log_y(x)=10.\n\nBut log_y(x) =1/log_x(y) = x/10 from earlier.\n\nSo substituting in: (100/x)*(x/10)= (100/x)*(x/10)=100/10=10. Which matches the equation. So that's good.\n\nNow, let's check the first substitution.\n\nWe have log_x(25) = (10/x)+1.\n\nBut log_x(25) is ln(25)/ln(x). Let me see if that equals (10/x)+1.",

Note that log_y(x) is reciprocal of log_x(y), so log_y(x) = x/10.\n\n4. Substituting into the second equation: 4y*(x/10)=10.\n\n5. Simplify: (4xy)/10 =10 \u2192 4xy=100 \u2192 xy=25.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent.

So log_x((25/x)^x) = x * log_x(25/x) =10.\n\nWhich is x*(log_x(25) - log_x(x)) = x*(log_x(25) -1)=10.\n\nSo log_x(25) = (10/x) +1.\n\nSimilarly, from the second equation: log_y(x^{4y})=10.\n\nx^{4y} =x^{4*(25/x)}=x^{100/x}.\n\nSo log_y(x^{100/x}) = (100/x) * log_y(x)=10.\n\nBut log_y(x) =1/log_x(y) = x/10 from earlier.\n\nSo substituting in: (100/x)*(x/10)= (100/x)*(x/10)=100/10=10. Which matches the equation. So that's good.\n\nNow, let's check the first substitution.\n\nWe have log_x(25) = (10/x)+1.\n\nBut log_x(25) is ln(25)/ln(x). Let me see if that equals (10/x)+1.",

So log_x((25/x)^x) = x * log_x(25/x) =10.\n\nWhich is x*(log_x(25) - log_x(x)) = x*(log_x(25) -1)=10.\n\nSo log_x(25) = (10/x) +1.\n\nSimilarly, from the second equation: log_y(x^{4y})=10.\n\nx^{4y} =x^{4*(25/x)}=x^{100/x}.\n\nSo log_y(x^{100/x}) = (100/x) * log_y(x)=10.\n\nBut log_y(x) =1/log_x(y) = x/10 from earlier.\n\nSo substituting in: (100/x)*(x/10)= (100/x)*(x/10)=100/10=10.

So, if log_x(y) = a, then log_y(x) = 1/a.\n\nSo, substituting that in, the equation becomes 4y * (1/a) =10.\n\nBut from earlier, we know that a = 10/x. So, 1/a = x/10.\n\nSubstituting that into the second equation: 4y * (x/10) =10.\n\nSimplify that: (4xy)/10 =10. Multiply both sides by10: 4xy=100. So, xy=25.",
