          "text1": "Wait, so f(x) is | |x| - 1/2 |. Let me think about how this looks:\n\n- When |x| is greater than or equal to 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2.\n- When |x| is less than 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so f(x) = -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|.\n\nSo, the graph of f(x) will be a V-shape that is V pointing down between x = -1/2 and x = 1/2, reaching a maximum of 1/2 at x=0, and then it becomes V pointing up outside of that interval, with the vertex at ( \u00b11/2, 0 ). So, the function f(x) looks like a \"W\" but on a smaller scale, maybe? Or more like two Vs back-to-back.\n\nSimilarly, let's consider g(x) = | |x| - 1/4 |.\n\nAgain, the inner function is |x|, subtract 1/4, then absolute value.\n\nSo:\n- For |x| >= 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4.\n- For |x| < 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|.\n\nSo, the graph of g(x) is a V pointing down between x = -1/4 and x = 1/4, reaching a maximum of 1/4 at x=0, and V pointing up outside.\n\nNow, the functions inside the equations are g(f(...)), so I need to compose these functions.\n\nLet me first consider f(sin(2\u03c0x)) and then g of that.",
          "text2": "Wait, f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. Let me consider different intervals.\n\nFor x >= 0, |x| =x. So f(x) = |x - 1/2|. So, for x >=0, it's V-shaped with vertex at x=1/2, going down to 0 there.\n\nSimilarly, for x <=0, |x| = -x, so f(x) = |-x -1/2| = |x +1/2|. So, for x <=0, it's another V-shape with vertex at x = -1/2.\n\nSo overall, f(x) is a W-shaped graph, with minima at x= -1/2, 1/2, where the value is 0, and it peaks at x=0, where |0 -1/2|=1/2. So the graph of f(x) is like two Vs back-to-back, creating a W.\n\nSimilarly, g(x) = ||x| -1/4|. Same reasoning: for x >=0, g(x)=|x -1/4|. So vertex at x=1/4, and for x <=0, g(x) = |-x -1/4| = |x +1/4|, vertex at x=-1/4.\n\nSo g(x) is also a W-shaped graph, but with minima at x=1/4, -1/4, and peaks at x=0 with value 1/4.\n\nSo, f(x) has minima at \u00b11/2 and peaks at 0, x=0, and g(x) has minima at \u00b11/4 and peaks at 0.\n\nNow, the functions are y =4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) and x=4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))). So, these are transformed versions of sine and cosine functions, passed through f and g, scaled by 4.\n\nSo, let's see. For the first equation, y is a function of x: y =4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))). The second equation is x =4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))). So, to find the intersections, we need points (x,y) that satisfy both equations.\n\nIn other words, for such a point, y must equal 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))), and x must equal 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nSo, substituting y from the first equation into the second, we get x = 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0 * [4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x)))] ))).\n\nHmm, that seems really complicated. Maybe instead, I can think about the ranges and possible values.\n\nFirst, let's analyze f(sin(2\u03c0x)).\n\nSince sin(2\u03c0x) ranges between -1 and 1.\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = || sin(2\u03c0x) | - 1/2 |.\n\nSimilarly, since |sin(2\u03c0x)| is between 0 and 1, so | |sin(2\u03c0x)| -1/2 |.\n\nWhat does this function look like? Let's let t = |sin(2\u03c0x)|, which is between 0 and 1.\n\nThen f(t) = |t - 1/2|.\n\nSo, when t >=1/2, f(t) = t -1/2, and when t <1/2, f(t)=1/2 -t.\n\nSo f(t) is a V-shape with vertex at t=1/2, f(t)=0, and it goes up to f(0)=1/2, f(1)=1/2.\n\nSo f(t) ranges from 0 to 1/2.\n\nThen, g(f(t)) is computed as g(s), where s = f(t) \u2208 [0, 1/2].\n\ng(s) = ||s| -1/4|.\n\nBut since s is between 0 and 1/2, |s| is just s.\n\nSo g(s) = |s -1/4|.\n\nSo when s <1/4, g(s)=1/4 -s.\n\nWhen s >=1/4, g(s)=s -1/4.\n\nSo g(s) ranges from 0 (at s=1/4) to 1/4 (at s=0 and s=1/2).\n\nSo, g(f(t)) = | |s| -1/4 |, which is |s -1/4|.\n\nSo, for s in [0,1/4], g(s)=1/4 -s. For s in [1/4,1/2], g(s)=s -1/4.\n\nHence, the maximum value of g(f(t)) is 1/4.\n\nSo, 4*g(f(t)) will have a maximum of 4*(1/4)=1, and minimum 0.\n\nThus, y =4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) will have y ranging between 0 and 1.\n\nSimilarly, in the second equation, x=4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nLet me analyze this as well.\n\nFirst, cos(3\u03c0y) is a function of y, ranges between -1 and 1.\n\nSo, f(cos(3\u03c0y)) = ||cos(3\u03c0y)| -1/2|, same as before.\n\nLet me write t = |cos(3\u03c0y)|, which is between 0 and 1.\n\nf(t)=|t -1/2|, same as before.\n\nSo f(t) ranges between 0 and 1/2.\n\nThen, g(f(t)) is |s -1/4| where s = f(t) \u2208 [0,1/2].\n\nSo, same as before, g(s) ranges between 0 (at s=1/4) and 1/4 (at s=0 and s=1/2).\n\nThus, 4*g(f(t)) is between 0 and 1.\n\nSo, both y and x in the equations are between 0 and1.\n\nSo, the graphs are in the unit square [0,1]x[0,1].\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Let's compute f(sin(2\u03c0x)):\n\nLet s = sin(2\u03c0x). So s is between -1 and 1. Then, |s| is between 0 and 1. Then, |s| - 1/2 is between -1/2 and 1/2. Taking absolute value, f(s) = ||s| - 1/2|.\n\nSo for |s| >= 1/2, f(s) = |s| - 1/2. For |s| < 1/2, f(s) = 1/2 - |s|.\n\nSo f(s) will vary between 0 and 1/2. Because when |s| = 1, f(s) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. When |s| = 1/2, f(s) = 0. When |s| is between 0 and 1/2, f(s) increases from 0 to 1/2 as |s| decreases from 1/2 to 0.\n\nSo f(s) has a maximum of 1/2 and a minimum of 0. So f(s) is in [0, 1/2].\n\nThen, g(f(s)) is g applied to [0, 1/2]. Let me compute g(t) where t is in [0, 1/2]. g(t) = ||t| - 1/4|.\n\nSince t is non-negative, |t| = t. So g(t) = |t - 1/4|.\n\nSo for t >= 1/4, g(t) = t - 1/4. For t < 1/4, g(t) = 1/4 - t.\n\nTherefore, g(t) is a V-shape with vertex at t=1/4, g(t)=0. It goes up on both sides. So when t is 0, g(t) = 1/4; when t is 1/2, g(t) = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.\n\nSo g(f(s)) is equal to |f(s) - 1/4|. But since f(s) is between 0 and 1/2, and 1/4 is within that interval, g(f(s)) will have a V shape. When f(s) < 1/4, g(f(s)) = 1/4 - f(s). When f(s) >=1/4, g(f(s)) = f(s) - 1/4.\n\nSo then, 4 * g(f(s)) is 4 * |f(s) - 1/4|.\n\nSo 4 * g(f(s)) can be written as:\n\nIf f(s) < 1/4: 4*(1/4 - f(s)) = 1 - 4 f(s)\n\nIf f(s) >=1/4: 4*(f(s) - 1/4) = 4 f(s) -1\n\nSo 4 g(f(s)) is a piecewise function with two linear parts.\n\nBut since f(s) is a function of sin(2\u03c0x), which is periodic, we can think about the behavior over each period.\n\nSimilarly, for the other equation, x =4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))), it's symmetric but with cos(3\u03c0y) instead of sin(2\u03c0x). Let me analyze that.\n\nLet me write down expressions for both y and x.\n\nFirst equation: y =4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x)))\n\nSecond equation: x =4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y)))\n\nSo each variable is expressed in terms of the other, but with different functions inside.\n\nI need to find the number of intersection points (x,y) that satisfy both equations.\n\nSo for each (x,y), y =4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) and x =4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).",
          "text2": "Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of |t|: Let me denote |t| as s, so s \u2208 [0,1]. Then f(t) = |s - 1/2|.\n\nSo, s is from 0 to 1. When s < 1/2, f(t) = 1/2 - s. When s >= 1/2, f(t) = s - 1/2.\n\nSo, as s increases from 0 to 1/2, f decreases from 1/2 to 0, and then as s increases from 1/2 to 1, f increases from 0 to 1/2.\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) will have this behavior as sin(2\u03c0x) varies between -1 and 1.\n\nThen, g is applied to f(sin(2\u03c0x)). So, g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) is equal to ||f(sin(2\u03c0x))| - 1/4|.\n\nBut since f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is always non-negative (because it's an absolute value), this is just |f(sin(2\u03c0x)) - 1/4|.\n\nSo, let's let u = f(sin(2\u03c0x)).

When |sin(2\u03c0x)| is 1, f is 1/2 as well. At |sin(2\u03c0x)| = 1/2, f is 0.\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) ranges from 0 to 1/2.\n\nTherefore, u = f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is in [0, 1/2].\n\nSo, when u is in [0,1/4), g(u) = 1/4 - u.\n\nWhen u is in [1/4,1/2], g(u) = u - 1/4.\n\nSo, g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) is a piecewise function depending on the value of u.\n\nSo, let's consider the two cases:\n\n1.

The cos(3\u03c0y) term has a period of 2/3 because the period of cos(ky) is 2\u03c0/k, so 2\u03c0/(3\u03c0)=2/3.\n\nSo, the period for cos(3\u03c0y) is 2/3, but with the absolute value, it's going to be 1/3.",
          "text2": "Wait, when z is 0: g(z) = 1/4 - 0 = 1/4  \nWhen z = 1/4: g(z) = 0  \nWhen z = 1/2: g(z) = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4\n\nSo the graph of g(z) over z in [0, 1/2] is a V-shape, going from 1/4 at z=0 down to 0 at z=1/4, then up to 1/4 again at z=1/2.\n\nSo, the output of g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) is between 0 and 1/4.\n\nThen, y is 4 times that, so y = 4 * [0 to 1/4] = [0, 1].\n\nSo y ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nSimilarly, let's look at the second equation: x = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nSame structure, but with cosine and 3\u03c0y. Let's analyze this.\n\nAgain, f(cos(3\u03c0y)) is ||cos(3\u03c0y)| - 1/2|. The inner function is |cos(3\u03c0y)|, which is in [0,1]. Then subtract 1/2, and take absolute value, so f(cos(...)) is in [0, 1/2], same as before.\n\nThen, g is applied, same as before, so g(f(cos(...))) is in [0,1/4]. Then multiplied by 4, so x ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nSo both equations y = ... and x = ... have outputs in [0,1]. So the intersections will be in the square [0,1] x [0,1].\n\nNow, to find the number of intersections, I need to find the number of (x, y) pairs where both equations are satisfied. So, for each x in [0,1], y is determined by the first equation, and for each y, x is determined by the second equation. So it's a mutual dependency, which makes it a system to solve.\n\nHmm. This seems complicated because each equation is a function that's been composed multiple times. Maybe I can approach this graphically.",

Hmm, maybe I should draw it.\n\nSimilarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's analyze this. For x >=0, g(x) = |x -1/4|. So, for x between 0 and 1/4, it's 1/4 - x, and for x >=1/4, it's x -1/4. For x <=0, since it's |x|, it becomes |(-x) -1/4| = |x +1/4|. So, for x between -1/4 and 0, it's -x -1/4, and for x <= -1/4, it's -x -1/4. Therefore, g(x) is a V shape at x =0, peaking at (0,1/4), dipping down to 0 at x=\u00b11/4, and then increasing again beyond that.\n\nSo, both f and g are piecewise linear functions with multiple segments.\n\nNow, the functions inside the problem are transformations of these. Let me look at the first function: y = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))).\n\nSo, this is a composition of functions. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, start with sin(2\u03c0x). The sine function has a period of 2\u03c0/(2\u03c0)=1. So, sin(2\u03c0x) has a period of 1. It oscillates between -1 and 1.\n\nThen, f is applied to sin(2\u03c0x), so f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = || sin(2\u03c0x) | - 1/2|. Let's think about the range of sin(2\u03c0x): it's between -1 and 1. So, |sin(2\u03c0x)| is between 0 and 1.\n\nThen, subtracting 1/2: |sin(2\u03c0x)| -1/2 can be between -1/2 and 1/2. Taking the absolute value of that gives f(sin(2\u03c0x)) as || sin(2\u03c0x) | -1/2 |, which is between 0 and 1/2.\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) varies between 0 and 1/2.\n\nThen, g is applied to this result: g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) = || f(sin(2\u03c0x)) | -1/4 |.",
          "text2": "Wait, if x is between -1/4 and 0, then -x is between 0 and 1/4. So -x -1/4 is between -1/4 and 0.

Since x < -1/4, x +1/4 is negative, so g(x)= -(x +1/4) = -x -1/4.\n\nSo the graph of g(x) is similar to f(x) but with different breakpoints at x=1/4 and x=-1/4. So it's a V-shape that touches the x-axis at x=1/4 and x=-1/4, and has a peak at x=0 of height 1/4.\n\nOkay, so now I have f and g defined. Now, the functions in the problem are y = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nHmm. So both functions involve nesting f and g, but one is applied to sin(2\u03c0x) and the other to cos(3\u03c0y). Also, one is multiplied by 4 and equals y, and the other equals x.\n\nThis seems complex, so maybe I should try to understand the range of these functions first.\n\nLet me try to figure out the possible outputs of f(sin(2\u03c0x)) and then g of that.\n\nFirst, since sin(2\u03c0x) ranges between -1 and 1. Then f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is taking the absolute value, subtracting 1/2, then taking absolute again. Let me compute the possible range of f(sin(2\u03c0x)).\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = || sin(2\u03c0x) | - 1/2 |.\n\nThe inner |sin(2\u03c0x)| ranges from 0 to 1. So |sin(2\u03c0x)| -1/2 ranges from -1/2 to 1/2. Then taking absolute makes it range from 0 to 1/2. So f(sin(2\u03c0x)) ranges between 0 and 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, then g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) = || f(sin(2\u03c0x)) -1/4 |.\n\nSince f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is between 0 and 1/2, let's see:\n\nIf f(sin(...)) >=1/4, then g(...) = f(...) -1/4.\n\nIf f(...) <1/4, then g(...) = 1/4 - f(...).\n\nSo the range of g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) is from 0 to 1/4.\n\nBecause when f(...) is in [0,1/4), g(...) is 1/4 - f(...), which decreases from 1/4 to 0.\n\nWhen f(...) is in [1/4,1/2], g(...) is f(...) -1/4, which increases from 0 to 1/4.\n\nSo g(f(...)) ranges from 0 to 1/4.\n\nThen, 4g(f(...)) would range from 0 to 1.\n\nSimilarly, for the other function: x =4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nSame reasoning applies. cos(3\u03c0y) ranges between -1 and 1, so f(cos(...)) ranges between 0 and 1/2, then g(f(...)) ranges between 0 and 1/4, so 4g(...) ranges between 0 and1.\n\nSo both y and x in the equations range between 0 and1.

The next step is to understand the composite functions involved in the given equations.\n\nFirst equation: y = 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))).\n\nLet me parse this. The outer function is 4 times g of f of sin(2\u03c0x). Similarly, the second equation is x = 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nSo let's understand the inner functions step by step.\n\nLet me first analyze the function h(x) = f(sin(2\u03c0x)). Since sin(2\u03c0x) is a sine wave oscillating between -1 and 1 with period 1 (since 2\u03c0x has period 1). So h(x) = f(sin(2\u03c0x)).\n\nSince f is applied to sin(2\u03c0x), which ranges between -1 and 1, let's see how f behaves on this interval.\n\nGiven f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|, as we saw earlier. So for x in [-1,1], |x| is in [0,1]. So |x| - 1/2 is in [-1/2, 1/2]. Then, taking absolute value again.\n\nSo f(x) in this case would be:\n\n- For |x| >= 1/2 (which, since x is in [-1,1], that's when |x| >= 1/2), f(x) = |x| - 1/2.\n- For |x| < 1/2, f(x) = 1/2 - |x|.\n\nSo when x is in [-1,1], f(x) is a diamond shape as we discussed earlier.\n\nSo h(x) = f(sin(2\u03c0x)) will take sin(2\u03c0x) and apply f. Let's consider the range of sin(2\u03c0x): it's between -1 and 1, so h(x) will be f evaluated at points in [-1,1].\n\nSo let's compute f(sin(2\u03c0x)).\n\nFor a given x, sin(2\u03c0x) is in [-1,1], so |sin(2\u03c0x)| is in [0,1]. Then |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 is in [-1/2, 1/2]. So f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is the absolute value of that, which is:\n\n- If |sin(2\u03c0x)| >= 1/2, then f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2.\n- If |sin(2\u03c0x)| < 1/2, then f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = 1/2 - |sin(2\u03c0x)|.\n\nSo f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is a function that when sin(2\u03c0x) is above 1/2 or below -1/2, it subtracts 1/2, otherwise, it's 1/2 minus |sin(2\u03c0x)|.\n\nBut since sin(2\u03c0x) is symmetric, and absolute value is applied, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of |sin(2\u03c0x)|.\n\nSo h(x) = f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is equal to:\n\nh(x) = | | |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 | | ?",

Therefore, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is a function that is 1/2 - |sin(2\u03c0x)| when |sin(2\u03c0x)| < 1/2, and |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 when |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2265 1/2.\n\nThen, g is applied to that.

Let me think.\n\nSince sin(2\u03c0x) is periodic with period 1, and f and g are applied to it, but f and g are both even functions, meaning they only depend on |input|. So, sin(2\u03c0x) is an odd function, but after applying f and g, which take absolute values, the resulting function becomes even. So, y = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) is an even function in x, so it's symmetric about the y-axis. So, the function y repeats every 1 unit in x.\n\nSimilarly, in the second function, x = 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))). The cos(3\u03c0y) has a period of 2/3 in y. Moreover, cos is an even function, so cos(3\u03c0y) is even in y. Then, f and g are applied, which are also even functions. So, the entire expression 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) is an even function in y, meaning that x is symmetric about the y-axis.\n\nSo, the function x = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) is periodic with period 2/3 in y, and it's symmetric about y=0.\n\nHmm.

Since g(f(...)) is between 0 and 1/4, 4g(...) is between 0 and 1.\n\nSo, 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) is a function that can be written as:\n\nIf f(sin(2\u03c0x)) >= 1/4:\n\n4g(f(...)) = 4*(f(...) - 1/4) = 4f(...) - 1.\n\nElse:\n\n4g(f(...)) = 1 - 4f(...).\n\nSo, let's first understand f(sin(2\u03c0x)).

Taking absolute value, f(s) = ||s| - 1/2|.\n\nSo for |s| >= 1/2, f(s) = |s| - 1/2. For |s| < 1/2, f(s) = 1/2 - |s|.\n\nSo f(s) will vary between 0 and 1/2. Because when |s| = 1, f(s) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.

So when t is 0, g(t) = 1/4; when t is 1/2, g(t) = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.\n\nSo g(f(s)) is equal to |f(s) - 1/4|.

So the entire function y is periodic with period 1.\n\nSimilarly, the function x=4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) involves cos(3\u03c0y), which has period 2/3. So the function x is periodic with period 2/3 in y.\n\nSo overall, the system is periodic with periods 1 in x and 2/3 in y.

Maybe I can analyze the possible ranges and periodicity.\n\nFirst, let's consider the periods of the functions. The function sin(2\u03c0x) has a period of 1, so f(sin(2\u03c0x)) and then g of that would also have period 1. Similarly, 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) would inherit this period, so y is periodic with period 1 in x. So, y repeats every 1 unit along x.\n\nOn the other hand, the function cos(3\u03c0y) has a period of 2/3 in y. So, 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) would have period 2/3 in y, so x is periodic with period 2/3 in y.\n\nHmm. So, the graph of y is a function with period 1 in x, and x is a function with period 2/3 in y. So, to find all intersections, perhaps I can find the number of intersections in a fundamental region and then multiply by the number of repetitions.\n\nBut maybe I should first understand what the functions y = 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) look like.\n\nLet me try to graph y = 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) first.\n\nAs I said, sin(2\u03c0x) has a period of 1, and it's a sine wave oscillating between -1 and 1.\n\nThen, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = | |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 |.\n\nSo, since sin(2\u03c0x) is between -1 and 1, |sin(2\u03c0x)| is between 0 and 1. So, |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 can be negative or positive.\n\nSpecifically, when |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2265 1/2, the expression is non-negative. When |sin(2\u03c0x)| < 1/2, it's negative, so taking absolute value would flip it. Therefore, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is a function that is 1/2 - |sin(2\u03c0x)| when |sin(2\u03c0x)| < 1/2, and |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 when |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2265 1/2.\n\nThen, g is applied to that. So, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is in [0, 1/2], as earlier. Then, g of that is | |f(sin(2\u03c0x))| - 1/4 |.",

Then, subtracting 1/2 shifts it down by 1/2, so |x| - 1/2. This would create a V-shape that's shifted down, with vertices at (0, -1/2). But since we take the absolute value of that, f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|, it would reflect any negative parts back up. \n\nSo, the graph of f(x):\n\n- For |x| >= 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2.\n- For |x| < 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so f(x) = -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|.\n\nSo, f(x) is a piecewise function:\n- f(x) = |x| - 1/2, when |x| >= 1/2.\n- f(x) = 1/2 - |x|, when |x| < 1/2.\n\nThis creates a W-shaped graph, I think. Because for |x| >= 1/2, it's a V-shape going upwards, and for |x| < 1/2, it's a V-shape going downwards. So, f(x) is a combination of Vs, peaking at 1/2 in the middle and then going back down.\n\nSimilarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's analyze that.\n\ng(x) = ||x| - 1/4|.\n\nAgain, similar structure. The inner function is |x|, subtract 1/4, then take absolute value.\n\n- For |x| >= 1/4, |x| - 1/4 is non-negative, so g(x) = |x| - 1/4.\n- For |x| < 1/4, |x| - 1/4 is negative, so g(x) = -( |x| - 1/4 ) = 1/4 - |x|.\n\nSo, g(x) is also a piecewise function:\n- g(x) = |x| - 1/4, when |x| >= 1/4.\n- g(x) = 1/4 - |x|, when |x| < 1/4.\n\nThis also creates a W-shaped graph but with smaller peaks at 1/4.\n\nNow, the functions in the problem are:\n\ny = 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x)))\n\nand\n\nx = 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y)))\n\nSo, let's think about how these functions behave.\n\nFirst, for y = 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))):\n\nWe can consider the composition step by step.\n\n1. Start with sin(2\u03c0x). The sine function has a period of 1, since 2\u03c0x has period 1. So, sin(2\u03c0x) is a wave that goes from 0 to 1 to 0 to -1 and back to 0 as x goes from 0 to 0.5 to 1 to 1.5, etc.\n\n2. Then, f is applied to that: f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = ||sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2|.\n\nWe know that f(x) is a V and W shape, so f(sin(...)) will transform the sine wave.\n\n3.

So, for x <=0, it's another V-shape with vertex at x = -1/2.\n\nSo overall, f(x) is a W-shaped graph, with minima at x= -1/2, 1/2, where the value is 0, and it peaks at x=0, where |0 -1/2|=1/2. So the graph of f(x) is like two Vs back-to-back, creating a W.\n\nSimilarly, g(x) = ||x| -1/4|. Same reasoning: for x >=0, g(x)=|x -1/4|. So vertex at x=1/4, and for x <=0, g(x) = |-x -1/4| = |x +1/4|, vertex at x=-1/4.\n\nSo g(x) is also a W-shaped graph, but with minima at x=1/4, -1/4, and peaks at x=0 with value 1/4.\n\nSo, f(x) has minima at \u00b11/2 and peaks at 0, x=0, and g(x) has minima at \u00b11/4 and peaks at 0.\n\nNow, the functions are y =4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) and x=4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))). So, these are transformed versions of sine and cosine functions, passed through f and g, scaled by 4.\n\nSo, let's see. For the first equation, y is a function of x: y =4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))). The second equation is x =4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))). So, to find the intersections, we need points (x,y) that satisfy both equations.\n\nIn other words, for such a point, y must equal 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))), and x must equal 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nSo, substituting y from the first equation into the second, we get x = 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0 * [4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x)))] ))).\n\nHmm, that seems really complicated. Maybe instead, I can think about the ranges and possible values.\n\nFirst, let's analyze f(sin(2\u03c0x)).\n\nSince sin(2\u03c0x) ranges between -1 and 1.\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = || sin(2\u03c0x) | - 1/2 |.\n\nSimilarly, since |sin(2\u03c0x)| is between 0 and 1, so | |sin(2\u03c0x)| -1/2 |.\n\nWhat does this function look like? Let's let t = |sin(2\u03c0x)|, which is between 0 and 1.\n\nThen f(t) = |t - 1/2|.\n\nSo, when t >=1/2, f(t) = t -1/2, and when t <1/2, f(t)=1/2 -t.\n\nSo f(t) is a V-shape with vertex at t=1/2, f(t)=0, and it goes up to f(0)=1/2, f(1)=1/2.\n\nSo f(t) ranges from 0 to 1/2.\n\nThen, g(f(t)) is computed as g(s), where s = f(t) \u2208 [0, 1/2].\n\ng(s) = ||s| -1/4|.\n\nBut since s is between 0 and 1/2, |s| is just s.\n\nSo g(s) = |s -1/4|.\n\nSo when s <1/4, g(s)=1/4 -s.\n\nWhen s >=1/4, g(s)=s -1/4.\n\nSo g(s) ranges from 0 (at s=1/4) to 1/4 (at s=0 and s=1/2).\n\nSo, g(f(t)) = | |s| -1/4 |, which is |s -1/4|.\n\nSo, for s in [0,1/4], g(s)=1/4 -s. For s in [1/4,1/2], g(s)=s -1/4.\n\nHence, the maximum value of g(f(t)) is 1/4.\n\nSo, 4*g(f(t)) will have a maximum of 4*(1/4)=1, and minimum 0.\n\nThus, y =4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) will have y ranging between 0 and 1.\n\nSimilarly, in the second equation, x=4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nLet me analyze this as well.\n\nFirst, cos(3\u03c0y) is a function of y, ranges between -1 and 1.\n\nSo, f(cos(3\u03c0y)) = ||cos(3\u03c0y)| -1/2|, same as before.\n\nLet me write t = |cos(3\u03c0y)|, which is between 0 and 1.\n\nf(t)=|t -1/2|, same as before.\n\nSo f(t) ranges between 0 and 1/2.\n\nThen, g(f(t)) is |s -1/4| where s = f(t) \u2208 [0,1/2].\n\nSo, same as before, g(s) ranges between 0 (at s=1/4) and 1/4 (at s=0 and s=1/2).\n\nThus, 4*g(f(t)) is between 0 and 1.\n\nSo, both y and x in the equations are between 0 and1.\n\nSo, the graphs are in the unit square [0,1]x[0,1].\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

When |s| = 1/2, f(s) = 0. When |s| is between 0 and 1/2, f(s) increases from 0 to 1/2 as |s| decreases from 1/2 to 0.\n\nSo f(s) has a maximum of 1/2 and a minimum of 0.

So g(t) = |t - 1/4|.\n\nSo for t >= 1/4, g(t) = t - 1/4. For t < 1/4, g(t) = 1/4 - t.\n\nTherefore, g(t) is a V-shape with vertex at t=1/4, g(t)=0. It goes up on both sides. So when t is 0, g(t) = 1/4; when t is 1/2, g(t) = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.\n\nSo g(f(s)) is equal to |f(s) - 1/4|.

When f(s) >=1/4, g(f(s)) = f(s) - 1/4.\n\nSo then, 4 * g(f(s)) is 4 * |f(s) - 1/4|.\n\nSo 4 * g(f(s)) can be written as:\n\nIf f(s) < 1/4: 4*(1/4 - f(s)) = 1 - 4 f(s)\n\nIf f(s) >=1/4: 4*(f(s) - 1/4) = 4 f(s) -1\n\nSo 4 g(f(s)) is a piecewise function with two linear parts.\n\nBut since f(s) is a function of sin(2\u03c0x), which is periodic, we can think about the behavior over each period.\n\nSimilarly, for the other equation, x =4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))), it's symmetric but with cos(3\u03c0y) instead of sin(2\u03c0x).

When s >= 1/2, f(t) = s - 1/2.\n\nSo, as s increases from 0 to 1/2, f decreases from 1/2 to 0, and then as s increases from 1/2 to 1, f increases from 0 to 1/2.\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) will have this behavior as sin(2\u03c0x) varies between -1 and 1.\n\nThen, g is applied to f(sin(2\u03c0x)).

Then g(u) = |u - 1/4|.\n\nSo, when u >= 1/4, g(u) = u - 1/4. When u < 1/4, g(u) = 1/4 - u.\n\nSo, combining this, we have:\n\ng(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) = |f(sin(2\u03c0x)) - 1/4|.\n\nBut f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is | |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 |.\n\nLet me try to find the range of f(sin(2\u03c0x)):\n\nsin(2\u03c0x) ranges from -1 to 1.\n\nSo, |sin(2\u03c0x)| ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nThen, | |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 | = f(sin(2\u03c0x)).\n\nSo, when |sin(2\u03c0x)| is 0, f is 1/2. When |sin(2\u03c0x)| is 1, f is 1/2 as well. At |sin(2\u03c0x)| = 1/2, f is 0.\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) ranges from 0 to 1/2.\n\nTherefore, u = f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is in [0, 1/2].\n\nSo, when u is in [0,1/4), g(u) = 1/4 - u.\n\nWhen u is in [1/4,1/2], g(u) = u - 1/4.\n\nSo, g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) is a piecewise function depending on the value of u.\n\nSo, let's consider the two cases:\n\n1. When u >= 1/4 (i.e., f(sin(2\u03c0x)) >= 1/4), then g(u) = u - 1/4.\n\n2. When u < 1/4, g(u) = 1/4 - u.\n\nSo, for y = 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))), we can write:\n\ny = 4 * [ (f(sin(2\u03c0x)) - 1/4) if f(sin(2\u03c0x)) >=1/4 else (1/4 - f(sin(2\u03c0x))) ]\n\nSo, substituting f(sin(2\u03c0x)):\n\nf(sin(2\u03c0x)) = | |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 |.\n\nLet me denote |sin(2\u03c0x)| as s, so s \u2208 [0,1].\n\nSo, f = |s - 1/2|.\n\nSo, f >=1/4 when |s - 1/2| >=1/4.\n\nWhich implies s -1/2 >=1/4 or s -1/2 <= -1/4.\n\nWhich gives s >= 3/4 or s <= 1/4.\n\nSince s is non-negative, s <=1/4 is when s is between 0 and 1/4.\n\nSo, for s in [0,1/4] or [3/4,1], g(f) is f -1/4.\n\nAnd for s in (1/4,3/4), g(f) is 1/4 - f.\n\nBut f is |s -1/2|, so when s is in [0,1/4], f = 1/2 - s, which is in [1/4,1/2].",

Also, one is multiplied by 4 and equals y, and the other equals x.\n\nThis seems complex, so maybe I should try to understand the range of these functions first.\n\nLet me try to figure out the possible outputs of f(sin(2\u03c0x)) and then g of that.\n\nFirst, since sin(2\u03c0x) ranges between -1 and 1. Then f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is taking the absolute value, subtracting 1/2, then taking absolute again. Let me compute the possible range of f(sin(2\u03c0x)).\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = || sin(2\u03c0x) | - 1/2 |.\n\nThe inner |sin(2\u03c0x)| ranges from 0 to 1. So |sin(2\u03c0x)| -1/2 ranges from -1/2 to 1/2. Then taking absolute makes it range from 0 to 1/2. So f(sin(2\u03c0x)) ranges between 0 and 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, then g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) = || f(sin(2\u03c0x)) -1/4 |.\n\nSince f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is between 0 and 1/2, let's see:\n\nIf f(sin(...)) >=1/4, then g(...) = f(...) -1/4.\n\nIf f(...) <1/4, then g(...) = 1/4 - f(...).\n\nSo the range of g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) is from 0 to 1/4.\n\nBecause when f(...) is in [0,1/4), g(...) is 1/4 - f(...), which decreases from 1/4 to 0.\n\nWhen f(...) is in [1/4,1/2], g(...) is f(...) -1/4, which increases from 0 to 1/4.\n\nSo g(f(...)) ranges from 0 to 1/4.\n\nThen, 4g(f(...)) would range from 0 to 1.\n\nSimilarly, for the other function: x =4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nSame reasoning applies. cos(3\u03c0y) ranges between -1 and 1, so f(cos(...)) ranges between 0 and 1/2, then g(f(...)) ranges between 0 and 1/4, so 4g(...) ranges between 0 and1.\n\nSo both y and x in the equations range between 0 and1. So the possible points of intersection lie in the unit square [0,1]x[0,1].",

The next step is to understand the composite functions involved in the given equations.\n\nFirst equation: y = 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))).\n\nLet me parse this. The outer function is 4 times g of f of sin(2\u03c0x). Similarly, the second equation is x = 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nSo let's understand the inner functions step by step.\n\nLet me first analyze the function h(x) = f(sin(2\u03c0x)). Since sin(2\u03c0x) is a sine wave oscillating between -1 and 1 with period 1 (since 2\u03c0x has period 1). So h(x) = f(sin(2\u03c0x)).\n\nSince f is applied to sin(2\u03c0x), which ranges between -1 and 1, let's see how f behaves on this interval.\n\nGiven f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|, as we saw earlier. So for x in [-1,1], |x| is in [0,1]. So |x| - 1/2 is in [-1/2, 1/2]. Then, taking absolute value again.\n\nSo f(x) in this case would be:\n\n- For |x| >= 1/2 (which, since x is in [-1,1], that's when |x| >= 1/2), f(x) = |x| - 1/2.\n- For |x| < 1/2, f(x) = 1/2 - |x|.\n\nSo when x is in [-1,1], f(x) is a diamond shape as we discussed earlier.\n\nSo h(x) = f(sin(2\u03c0x)) will take sin(2\u03c0x) and apply f. Let's consider the range of sin(2\u03c0x): it's between -1 and 1, so h(x) will be f evaluated at points in [-1,1].\n\nSo let's compute f(sin(2\u03c0x)).\n\nFor a given x, sin(2\u03c0x) is in [-1,1], so |sin(2\u03c0x)| is in [0,1]. Then |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 is in [-1/2, 1/2]. So f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is the absolute value of that, which is:\n\n- If |sin(2\u03c0x)| >= 1/2, then f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2.\n- If |sin(2\u03c0x)| < 1/2, then f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = 1/2 - |sin(2\u03c0x)|.\n\nSo f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is a function that when sin(2\u03c0x) is above 1/2 or below -1/2, it subtracts 1/2, otherwise, it's 1/2 minus |sin(2\u03c0x)|.\n\nBut since sin(2\u03c0x) is symmetric, and absolute value is applied, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of |sin(2\u03c0x)|.\n\nSo h(x) = f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is equal to:\n\nh(x) = | | |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 | | ?",

Maybe I can analyze the possible ranges and periodicity.\n\nFirst, let's consider the periods of the functions. The function sin(2\u03c0x) has a period of 1, so f(sin(2\u03c0x)) and then g of that would also have period 1. Similarly, 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) would inherit this period, so y is periodic with period 1 in x.

So, |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 can be negative or positive.\n\nSpecifically, when |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2265 1/2, the expression is non-negative. When |sin(2\u03c0x)| < 1/2, it's negative, so taking absolute value would flip it. Therefore, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is a function that is 1/2 - |sin(2\u03c0x)| when |sin(2\u03c0x)| < 1/2, and |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 when |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2265 1/2.\n\nThen, g is applied to that. So, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is in [0, 1/2], as earlier. Then, g of that is | |f(sin(2\u03c0x))| - 1/4 |.",

Therefore, the system is confined to the unit square [0,1] x [0,1].\n\nNow, perhaps the number of intersections can be determined by analyzing how these functions behave within this square.\n\nLet me try to understand the behavior of y = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))).\n\nSince sin(2\u03c0x) is a wave that oscillates between -1 and 1 with a period of 1. But since we take the absolute value, |sin(2\u03c0x)| is a wave that oscillates between 0 and 1 with a period of 1/2. So, in each interval of x from 0 to 1/2, |sin(2\u03c0x)| goes from 0 up to 1 and back to 0. Similarly, in each interval of 1/2 to 1, it goes from 0 up to 1 and back to 0.\n\nBut since f and g are applied, the function y = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) will have a more complex shape.\n\nLet me consider how y behaves as x increases from 0 to 1/2.\n\nAt x=0: sin(0)=0, f(0)=1/2, g(1/2)=1/4, so y=4*(1/4)=1.\n\nAs x increases from 0 to 1/4, sin(2\u03c0x) increases from 0 to 1.\n\nSo, |sin(2\u03c0x)| increases from 0 to 1. Then, f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|) = ||sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2|.\n\nFrom x=0 to x=1/4, |sin(2\u03c0x)| increases from 0 to 1.\n\nSo, f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|) will be:\n\n- For |sin(2\u03c0x)| from 0 to 1/2, f = 1/2 - |sin(2\u03c0x)|.\n\n- For |sin(2\u03c0x)| from 1/2 to 1, f = |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2.\n\nThen, g(f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|)) is |f - 1/4|.\n\nSo, when f is in [0, 1/4], g(f) = 1/4 - f.\n\nWhen f is in [1/4, 1/2], g(f) = f - 1/4.\n\nSo, let's break down the behavior:\n\nFrom x=0 to x where |sin(2\u03c0x)|=1/2, which is x=1/4, since sin(2\u03c0*(1/4))=sin(\u03c0/2)=1.",

Maybe I can analyze the possible ranges and periodicity.\n\nFirst, let's consider the periods of the functions. The function sin(2\u03c0x) has a period of 1, so f(sin(2\u03c0x)) and then g of that would also have period 1. Similarly, 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) would inherit this period, so y is periodic with period 1 in x.

So, 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) would have period 2/3 in y, so x is periodic with period 2/3 in y.\n\nHmm. So, the graph of y is a function with period 1 in x, and x is a function with period 2/3 in y.

So, |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 can be negative or positive.\n\nSpecifically, when |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2265 1/2, the expression is non-negative. When |sin(2\u03c0x)| < 1/2, it's negative, so taking absolute value would flip it. Therefore, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is a function that is 1/2 - |sin(2\u03c0x)| when |sin(2\u03c0x)| < 1/2, and |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 when |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2265 1/2.\n\nThen, g is applied to that. So, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is in [0, 1/2], as earlier. Then, g of that is | |f(sin(2\u03c0x))| - 1/4 |.",

As z increases to 1/2, f(z) decreases to 0. Then, as z increases beyond 1/2, f(z) increases back to 1/2.\n\nThen, g(f(z)) = |f(z) - 1/4|.\n\nSo, when f(z) is less than 1/4, g(f(z)) = 1/4 - f(z). When f(z) is greater than or equal to 1/4, g(f(z)) = f(z) - 1/4.\n\nSo, let's analyze f(z):\n\nf(z) = |z - 1/2|, which is 1/2 - z when z <= 1/2, and z - 1/2 when z >= 1/2.\n\nSo, f(z) is a V-shaped function with minimum at z=1/2.\n\nThen, g(f(z)) is |f(z) - 1/4|.\n\nSo, when f(z) is between 0 and 1/4, g(f(z)) = 1/4 - f(z).\n\nWhen f(z) is between 1/4 and 1/2, g(f(z)) = f(z) - 1/4.\n\nSo, the graph of g(f(z)) will have a V-shape itself, peaking at f(z)=1/4.\n\nSo, when f(z) is at 1/4, g(f(z)) is zero.",

Then, subtracting 1/2 shifts it down by 1/2, so |x| - 1/2. This would create a V-shape that's shifted down, with vertices at (0, -1/2). But since we take the absolute value of that, f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|, it would reflect any negative parts back up. \n\nSo, the graph of f(x):\n\n- For |x| >= 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2.\n- For |x| < 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so f(x) = -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|.\n\nSo, f(x) is a piecewise function:\n- f(x) = |x| - 1/2, when |x| >= 1/2.\n- f(x) = 1/2 - |x|, when |x| < 1/2.\n\nThis creates a W-shaped graph, I think. Because for |x| >= 1/2, it's a V-shape going upwards, and for |x| < 1/2, it's a V-shape going downwards. So, f(x) is a combination of Vs, peaking at 1/2 in the middle and then going back down.\n\nSimilarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's analyze that.\n\ng(x) = ||x| - 1/4|.\n\nAgain, similar structure. The inner function is |x|, subtract 1/4, then take absolute value.\n\n- For |x| >= 1/4, |x| - 1/4 is non-negative, so g(x) = |x| - 1/4.\n- For |x| < 1/4, |x| - 1/4 is negative, so g(x) = -( |x| - 1/4 ) = 1/4 - |x|.\n\nSo, g(x) is also a piecewise function:\n- g(x) = |x| - 1/4, when |x| >= 1/4.\n- g(x) = 1/4 - |x|, when |x| < 1/4.\n\nThis also creates a W-shaped graph but with smaller peaks at 1/4.\n\nNow, the functions in the problem are:\n\ny = 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x)))\n\nand\n\nx = 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y)))\n\nSo, let's think about how these functions behave.\n\nFirst, for y = 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))):\n\nWe can consider the composition step by step.\n\n1. Start with sin(2\u03c0x). The sine function has a period of 1, since 2\u03c0x has period 1. So, sin(2\u03c0x) is a wave that goes from 0 to 1 to 0 to -1 and back to 0 as x goes from 0 to 0.5 to 1 to 1.5, etc.\n\n2. Then, f is applied to that: f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = ||sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2|.\n\nWe know that f(x) is a V and W shape, so f(sin(...)) will transform the sine wave.\n\n3. Then, g is applied to the result: g(f(sin(...))) = ||f(sin(...))| - 1/4|.\n\nAgain, g is another W-shape. So, this will transform the output of f.\n\n4. Multiply by 4: y = 4 * g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))).\n\nSimilarly for x = 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nSame steps, but with cos(3\u03c0y) inside.\n\nSo, perhaps it's helpful to analyze the range and possible outputs of these functions.\n\nFirst, let's consider f(sin(2\u03c0x)):\n\nSince sin(2\u03c0x) ranges between -1 and 1.\n\nSo, |sin(2\u03c0x)| ranges between 0 and 1. Then, |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 will range between -1/2 and 1/2.\n\nTaking the absolute value, f(sin(...)) = ||sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2|, so the output will be between 0 and 1/2.",
          "text2": "Wait, so f(x) is | |x| - 1/2 |. Let me think about how this looks:\n\n- When |x| is greater than or equal to 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2.\n- When |x| is less than 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so f(x) = -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|.\n\nSo, the graph of f(x) will be a V-shape that is V pointing down between x = -1/2 and x = 1/2, reaching a maximum of 1/2 at x=0, and then it becomes V pointing up outside of that interval, with the vertex at ( \u00b11/2, 0 ). So, the function f(x) looks like a \"W\" but on a smaller scale, maybe? Or more like two Vs back-to-back.\n\nSimilarly, let's consider g(x) = | |x| - 1/4 |.\n\nAgain, the inner function is |x|, subtract 1/4, then absolute value.\n\nSo:\n- For |x| >= 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4.\n- For |x| < 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|.\n\nSo, the graph of g(x) is a V pointing down between x = -1/4 and x = 1/4, reaching a maximum of 1/4 at x=0, and V pointing up outside.\n\nNow, the functions inside the equations are g(f(...)), so I need to compose these functions.\n\nLet me first consider f(sin(2\u03c0x)) and then g of that.",

The sine function has a period of 2\u03c0, but since it's sin(2\u03c0x), the period is 1. So it completes a full cycle every 1 unit along the x-axis.\n\nThen, we pass this through f.

So, the function f(x) looks like a \"W\" but on a smaller scale, maybe?

          "text2": "Wait, f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. Let me consider different intervals.\n\nFor x >= 0, |x| =x. So f(x) = |x - 1/2|. So, for x >=0, it's V-shaped with vertex at x=1/2, going down to 0 there.\n\nSimilarly, for x <=0, |x| = -x, so f(x) = |-x -1/2| = |x +1/2|. So, for x <=0, it's another V-shape with vertex at x = -1/2.\n\nSo overall, f(x) is a W-shaped graph, with minima at x= -1/2, 1/2, where the value is 0, and it peaks at x=0, where |0 -1/2|=1/2. So the graph of f(x) is like two Vs back-to-back, creating a W.\n\nSimilarly, g(x) = ||x| -1/4|. Same reasoning: for x >=0, g(x)=|x -1/4|. So vertex at x=1/4, and for x <=0, g(x) = |-x -1/4| = |x +1/4|, vertex at x=-1/4.\n\nSo g(x) is also a W-shaped graph, but with minima at x=1/4, -1/4, and peaks at x=0 with value 1/4.\n\nSo, f(x) has minima at \u00b11/2 and peaks at 0, x=0, and g(x) has minima at \u00b11/4 and peaks at 0.\n\nNow, the functions are y =4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) and x=4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))). So, these are transformed versions of sine and cosine functions, passed through f and g, scaled by 4.\n\nSo, let's see. For the first equation, y is a function of x: y =4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))). The second equation is x =4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))). So, to find the intersections, we need points (x,y) that satisfy both equations.\n\nIn other words, for such a point, y must equal 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))), and x must equal 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nSo, substituting y from the first equation into the second, we get x = 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0 * [4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x)))] ))).\n\nHmm, that seems really complicated. Maybe instead, I can think about the ranges and possible values.\n\nFirst, let's analyze f(sin(2\u03c0x)).\n\nSince sin(2\u03c0x) ranges between -1 and 1.\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = || sin(2\u03c0x) | - 1/2 |.\n\nSimilarly, since |sin(2\u03c0x)| is between 0 and 1, so | |sin(2\u03c0x)| -1/2 |.\n\nWhat does this function look like? Let's let t = |sin(2\u03c0x)|, which is between 0 and 1.\n\nThen f(t) = |t - 1/2|.\n\nSo, when t >=1/2, f(t) = t -1/2, and when t <1/2, f(t)=1/2 -t.\n\nSo f(t) is a V-shape with vertex at t=1/2, f(t)=0, and it goes up to f(0)=1/2, f(1)=1/2.\n\nSo f(t) ranges from 0 to 1/2.\n\nThen, g(f(t)) is computed as g(s), where s = f(t) \u2208 [0, 1/2].\n\ng(s) = ||s| -1/4|.\n\nBut since s is between 0 and 1/2, |s| is just s.\n\nSo g(s) = |s -1/4|.\n\nSo when s <1/4, g(s)=1/4 -s.\n\nWhen s >=1/4, g(s)=s -1/4.\n\nSo g(s) ranges from 0 (at s=1/4) to 1/4 (at s=0 and s=1/2).\n\nSo, g(f(t)) = | |s| -1/4 |, which is |s -1/4|.\n\nSo, for s in [0,1/4], g(s)=1/4 -s. For s in [1/4,1/2], g(s)=s -1/4.\n\nHence, the maximum value of g(f(t)) is 1/4.\n\nSo, 4*g(f(t)) will have a maximum of 4*(1/4)=1, and minimum 0.\n\nThus, y =4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) will have y ranging between 0 and 1.\n\nSimilarly, in the second equation, x=4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nLet me analyze this as well.\n\nFirst, cos(3\u03c0y) is a function of y, ranges between -1 and 1.\n\nSo, f(cos(3\u03c0y)) = ||cos(3\u03c0y)| -1/2|, same as before.\n\nLet me write t = |cos(3\u03c0y)|, which is between 0 and 1.\n\nf(t)=|t -1/2|, same as before.\n\nSo f(t) ranges between 0 and 1/2.\n\nThen, g(f(t)) is |s -1/4| where s = f(t) \u2208 [0,1/2].\n\nSo, same as before, g(s) ranges between 0 (at s=1/4) and 1/4 (at s=0 and s=1/2).\n\nThus, 4*g(f(t)) is between 0 and 1.\n\nSo, both y and x in the equations are between 0 and1.\n\nSo, the graphs are in the unit square [0,1]x[0,1].\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Let's compute f(sin(2\u03c0x)):\n\nLet s = sin(2\u03c0x). So s is between -1 and 1. Then, |s| is between 0 and 1. Then, |s| - 1/2 is between -1/2 and 1/2. Taking absolute value, f(s) = ||s| - 1/2|.\n\nSo for |s| >= 1/2, f(s) = |s| - 1/2. For |s| < 1/2, f(s) = 1/2 - |s|.\n\nSo f(s) will vary between 0 and 1/2. Because when |s| = 1, f(s) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. When |s| = 1/2, f(s) = 0. When |s| is between 0 and 1/2, f(s) increases from 0 to 1/2 as |s| decreases from 1/2 to 0.\n\nSo f(s) has a maximum of 1/2 and a minimum of 0. So f(s) is in [0, 1/2].\n\nThen, g(f(s)) is g applied to [0, 1/2]. Let me compute g(t) where t is in [0, 1/2]. g(t) = ||t| - 1/4|.\n\nSince t is non-negative, |t| = t. So g(t) = |t - 1/4|.\n\nSo for t >= 1/4, g(t) = t - 1/4. For t < 1/4, g(t) = 1/4 - t.\n\nTherefore, g(t) is a V-shape with vertex at t=1/4, g(t)=0. It goes up on both sides. So when t is 0, g(t) = 1/4; when t is 1/2, g(t) = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.\n\nSo g(f(s)) is equal to |f(s) - 1/4|.

When f(s) >=1/4, g(f(s)) = f(s) - 1/4.\n\nSo then, 4 * g(f(s)) is 4 * |f(s) - 1/4|.\n\nSo 4 * g(f(s)) can be written as:\n\nIf f(s) < 1/4: 4*(1/4 - f(s)) = 1 - 4 f(s)\n\nIf f(s) >=1/4: 4*(f(s) - 1/4) = 4 f(s) -1\n\nSo 4 g(f(s)) is a piecewise function with two linear parts.\n\nBut since f(s) is a function of sin(2\u03c0x), which is periodic, we can think about the behavior over each period.\n\nSimilarly, for the other equation, x =4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))), it's symmetric but with cos(3\u03c0y) instead of sin(2\u03c0x).

When s >= 1/2, f(t) = s - 1/2.\n\nSo, as s increases from 0 to 1/2, f decreases from 1/2 to 0, and then as s increases from 1/2 to 1, f increases from 0 to 1/2.\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) will have this behavior as sin(2\u03c0x) varies between -1 and 1.\n\nThen, g is applied to f(sin(2\u03c0x)).

Taking absolute value, f(s) = ||s| - 1/2|.\n\nSo for |s| >= 1/2, f(s) = |s| - 1/2. For |s| < 1/2, f(s) = 1/2 - |s|.\n\nSo f(s) will vary between 0 and 1/2. Because when |s| = 1, f(s) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. When |s| = 1/2, f(s) = 0. When |s| is between 0 and 1/2, f(s) increases from 0 to 1/2 as |s| decreases from 1/2 to 0.\n\nSo f(s) has a maximum of 1/2 and a minimum of 0. So f(s) is in [0, 1/2].\n\nThen, g(f(s)) is g applied to [0, 1/2]. Let me compute g(t) where t is in [0, 1/2]. g(t) = ||t| - 1/4|.\n\nSince t is non-negative, |t| = t. So g(t) = |t - 1/4|.\n\nSo for t >= 1/4, g(t) = t - 1/4. For t < 1/4, g(t) = 1/4 - t.\n\nTherefore, g(t) is a V-shape with vertex at t=1/4, g(t)=0. It goes up on both sides. So when t is 0, g(t) = 1/4; when t is 1/2, g(t) = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.\n\nSo g(f(s)) is equal to |f(s) - 1/4|. But since f(s) is between 0 and 1/2, and 1/4 is within that interval, g(f(s)) will have a V shape. When f(s) < 1/4, g(f(s)) = 1/4 - f(s). When f(s) >=1/4, g(f(s)) = f(s) - 1/4.\n\nSo then, 4 * g(f(s)) is 4 * |f(s) - 1/4|.\n\nSo 4 * g(f(s)) can be written as:\n\nIf f(s) < 1/4: 4*(1/4 - f(s)) = 1 - 4 f(s)\n\nIf f(s) >=1/4: 4*(f(s) - 1/4) = 4 f(s) -1\n\nSo 4 g(f(s)) is a piecewise function with two linear parts.\n\nBut since f(s) is a function of sin(2\u03c0x), which is periodic, we can think about the behavior over each period.\n\nSimilarly, for the other equation, x =4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))), it's symmetric but with cos(3\u03c0y) instead of sin(2\u03c0x).

So, the function f(cos(3\u03c0y)) would be a function of y, and then g of that, and then scaled by 4.\n\nSo, let's think about how x is defined in terms of y. So, x is a function of y, given by x = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nSimilarly, this function is periodic? Let's see. cos(3\u03c0y) has period 2/3 because cos has period 2\u03c0, and with 3\u03c0y, the period is (2\u03c0)/(3\u03c0) = 2/3. So, cos(3\u03c0(y + 2/3)) = cos(3\u03c0y + 2\u03c0) = cos(3\u03c0y).

Hmm, maybe I should draw it.\n\nSimilarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's analyze this. For x >=0, g(x) = |x -1/4|. So, for x between 0 and 1/4, it's 1/4 - x, and for x >=1/4, it's x -1/4. For x <=0, since it's |x|, it becomes |(-x) -1/4| = |x +1/4|. So, for x between -1/4 and 0, it's -x -1/4, and for x <= -1/4, it's -x -1/4. Therefore, g(x) is a V shape at x =0, peaking at (0,1/4), dipping down to 0 at x=\u00b11/4, and then increasing again beyond that.\n\nSo, both f and g are piecewise linear functions with multiple segments.\n\nNow, the functions inside the problem are transformations of these. Let me look at the first function: y = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))).\n\nSo, this is a composition of functions. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, start with sin(2\u03c0x). The sine function has a period of 2\u03c0/(2\u03c0)=1. So, sin(2\u03c0x) has a period of 1. It oscillates between -1 and 1.\n\nThen, f is applied to sin(2\u03c0x), so f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = || sin(2\u03c0x) | - 1/2|. Let's think about the range of sin(2\u03c0x): it's between -1 and 1. So, |sin(2\u03c0x)| is between 0 and 1.\n\nThen, subtracting 1/2: |sin(2\u03c0x)| -1/2 can be between -1/2 and 1/2. Taking the absolute value of that gives f(sin(2\u03c0x)) as || sin(2\u03c0x) | -1/2 |, which is between 0 and 1/2.\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) varies between 0 and 1/2.\n\nThen, g is applied to this result: g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) = || f(sin(2\u03c0x)) | -1/4 |.",
          "text2": "Wait, if x is between -1/4 and 0, then -x is between 0 and 1/4. So -x -1/4 is between -1/4 and 0. So it's negative, so the absolute value is -( -x -1/4 )= x +1/4.\n\nCase4: x < -1/4: |x| = -x, so g(x) = |-x -1/4| = |x +1/4|. Since x < -1/4, x +1/4 is negative, so g(x)= -(x +1/4) = -x -1/4.\n\nSo the graph of g(x) is similar to f(x) but with different breakpoints at x=1/4 and x=-1/4. So it's a V-shape that touches the x-axis at x=1/4 and x=-1/4, and has a peak at x=0 of height 1/4.\n\nOkay, so now I have f and g defined. Now, the functions in the problem are y = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nHmm. So both functions involve nesting f and g, but one is applied to sin(2\u03c0x) and the other to cos(3\u03c0y). Also, one is multiplied by 4 and equals y, and the other equals x.\n\nThis seems complex, so maybe I should try to understand the range of these functions first.\n\nLet me try to figure out the possible outputs of f(sin(2\u03c0x)) and then g of that.\n\nFirst, since sin(2\u03c0x) ranges between -1 and 1. Then f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is taking the absolute value, subtracting 1/2, then taking absolute again. Let me compute the possible range of f(sin(2\u03c0x)).\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = || sin(2\u03c0x) | - 1/2 |.\n\nThe inner |sin(2\u03c0x)| ranges from 0 to 1. So |sin(2\u03c0x)| -1/2 ranges from -1/2 to 1/2. Then taking absolute makes it range from 0 to 1/2. So f(sin(2\u03c0x)) ranges between 0 and 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, then g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) = || f(sin(2\u03c0x)) -1/4 |.\n\nSince f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is between 0 and 1/2, let's see:\n\nIf f(sin(...)) >=1/4, then g(...) = f(...) -1/4.\n\nIf f(...) <1/4, then g(...) = 1/4 - f(...).\n\nSo the range of g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) is from 0 to 1/4.\n\nBecause when f(...) is in [0,1/4), g(...) is 1/4 - f(...), which decreases from 1/4 to 0.\n\nWhen f(...) is in [1/4,1/2], g(...) is f(...) -1/4, which increases from 0 to 1/4.\n\nSo g(f(...)) ranges from 0 to 1/4.\n\nThen, 4g(f(...)) would range from 0 to 1.\n\nSimilarly, for the other function: x =4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nSame reasoning applies. cos(3\u03c0y) ranges between -1 and 1, so f(cos(...)) ranges between 0 and 1/2, then g(f(...)) ranges between 0 and 1/4, so 4g(...) ranges between 0 and1.\n\nSo both y and x in the equations range between 0 and1.

Let me plot f(x):\n\n- For |x| >= 1/2, |x| -1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| -1/2.\n- For |x| < 1/2, |x| -1/2 is negative, so f(x) = -( |x| -1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|.\n\nSo f(x) is a piecewise function:\n- When |x| >= 1/2: f(x) = |x| -1/2. This is two lines with slopes 1 and -1 starting from (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0).\n- When |x| < 1/2: f(x) = 1/2 - |x|. This is a V shape peaking at (0, 1/2), going down to (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0).\n\nSo f(x) is a diamond-shaped graph with vertices at (\u00b11/2, 0) and (0, 1/2). That makes sense.\n\nNow let's look at g(x). It's similar but with 1/4:\n\ng(x) = ||x| - 1/4|\n\nAgain, let's break it down:\n\n1. Start with |x|, then subtract 1/4.\n2. Take the absolute value of that.\n\nSo:\n\n- For |x| >= 1/4: g(x) = |x| - 1/4.\n- For |x| < 1/4: g(x) = 1/4 - |x|.\n\nSo g(x) is a diamond shape with vertices at (\u00b11/4, 0) and (0, 1/4).\n\nAlright, so now I have f(x) and g(x) defined. The next step is to understand the composite functions involved in the given equations.\n\nFirst equation: y = 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))).\n\nLet me parse this. The outer function is 4 times g of f of sin(2\u03c0x). Similarly, the second equation is x = 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nSo let's understand the inner functions step by step.\n\nLet me first analyze the function h(x) = f(sin(2\u03c0x)). Since sin(2\u03c0x) is a sine wave oscillating between -1 and 1 with period 1 (since 2\u03c0x has period 1). So h(x) = f(sin(2\u03c0x)).\n\nSince f is applied to sin(2\u03c0x), which ranges between -1 and 1, let's see how f behaves on this interval.\n\nGiven f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|, as we saw earlier. So for x in [-1,1], |x| is in [0,1]. So |x| - 1/2 is in [-1/2, 1/2]. Then, taking absolute value again.\n\nSo f(x) in this case would be:\n\n- For |x| >= 1/2 (which, since x is in [-1,1], that's when |x| >= 1/2), f(x) = |x| - 1/2.\n- For |x| < 1/2, f(x) = 1/2 - |x|.\n\nSo when x is in [-1,1], f(x) is a diamond shape as we discussed earlier.\n\nSo h(x) = f(sin(2\u03c0x)) will take sin(2\u03c0x) and apply f. Let's consider the range of sin(2\u03c0x): it's between -1 and 1, so h(x) will be f evaluated at points in [-1,1].\n\nSo let's compute f(sin(2\u03c0x)).\n\nFor a given x, sin(2\u03c0x) is in [-1,1], so |sin(2\u03c0x)| is in [0,1]. Then |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 is in [-1/2, 1/2]. So f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is the absolute value of that, which is:\n\n- If |sin(2\u03c0x)| >= 1/2, then f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2.\n- If |sin(2\u03c0x)| < 1/2, then f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = 1/2 - |sin(2\u03c0x)|.\n\nSo f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is a function that when sin(2\u03c0x) is above 1/2 or below -1/2, it subtracts 1/2, otherwise, it's 1/2 minus |sin(2\u03c0x)|.\n\nBut since sin(2\u03c0x) is symmetric, and absolute value is applied, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of |sin(2\u03c0x)|.\n\nSo h(x) = f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is equal to:\n\nh(x) = | | |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 | | ?",

The function sin(2\u03c0x) has a period of 1, so f(sin(2\u03c0x)) and then g of that would also have period 1. Similarly, 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) would inherit this period, so y is periodic with period 1 in x.

So, |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 can be negative or positive.\n\nSpecifically, when |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2265 1/2, the expression is non-negative.

Similarly, cos(3\u03c0y) has a period of 2/3, since cos(3\u03c0(y + 2/3)) = cos(3\u03c0y + 2\u03c0) = cos(3\u03c0y).\n\nSo, perhaps the functions y = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) are periodic with periods related to these. Let me think.\n\nSince sin(2\u03c0x) is periodic with period 1, and f and g are applied to it, but f and g are both even functions, meaning they only depend on |input|. So, sin(2\u03c0x) is an odd function, but after applying f and g, which take absolute values, the resulting function becomes even. So, y = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) is an even function in x, so it's symmetric about the y-axis. So, the function y repeats every 1 unit in x.\n\nSimilarly, in the second function, x = 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))). The cos(3\u03c0y) has a period of 2/3 in y. Moreover, cos is an even function, so cos(3\u03c0y) is even in y. Then, f and g are applied, which are also even functions. So, the entire expression 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) is an even function in y, meaning that x is symmetric about the y-axis.\n\nSo, the function x = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) is periodic with period 2/3 in y, and it's symmetric about y=0.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps the intersections between y = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) would repeat in a grid-like pattern every 1 unit in x and every 2/3 units in y. But I'm not entirely sure.

So:\n\n- When |sin(2\u03c0x)| >= 1/2, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2.\n\n- When |sin(2\u03c0x)| < 1/2, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = 1/2 - |sin(2\u03c0x)|.\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is a function that is V-shaped both above and below 1/2. It creates a series of triangles.\n\nSimilarly, g(f(...)) is then:\n\nIf f(...) >= 1/4, then g(...) = f(...) - 1/4.\n\nIf f(...) < 1/4, then g(...) = 1/4 - f(...).\n\nSo, 4g(f(...)) is either 4*(f(...) - 1/4) = 4f(...) - 1 or 4*(1/4 - f(...)) = 1 - 4f(...), but we have to make sure that 4g(f(...)) is non-negative. Since g(f(...)) is between 0 and 1/4, 4g(...) is between 0 and 1.\n\nSo, 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) is a function that can be written as:\n\nIf f(sin(2\u03c0x)) >= 1/4:\n\n4g(f(...)) = 4*(f(...) - 1/4) = 4f(...) - 1.\n\nElse:\n\n4g(f(...)) = 1 - 4f(...).\n\nSo, let's first understand f(sin(2\u03c0x)).

Its absolute value is a wave that goes from 0 up to 1 at x=0.25, 0.75, etc., and back to 0 at x=0, 1, 2, etc.\n\nThen, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is:\n\n- For each x, when |sin(2\u03c0x)| >= 1/2, f(...) = |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2.\n\n- Else, f(...) = 1/2 - |sin(2\u03c0x)|.\n\nSo, the graph of f(sin(2\u03c0x)) would consist of regions where it's decreasing from 1/2 to 0 when |sin(2\u03c0x)| goes from 0 to 1/2, and then increasing from 0 to 1/2 as |sin(2\u03c0x)| goes from 1/2 back to 1, and then decreasing again.",

Let me instead compute h(x) for a few points to see the pattern.\n\nAt x=0: h(0)=1/2.\n\nAt x=1/12: h(1/12)=0.\n\nAt x=1/4: h(1/4)=1/2.\n\nAt x=5/12: h(5/12)=0.\n\nAt x=1/2: h(1/2)=1/2.\n\nSo in the interval [0,1/2], h(x) goes from 1/2 down to 0 at 1/12, up to 1/2 at 1/4, down to 0 at 5/12, and up again to 1/2 at 1/2. So it's a series of triangles.\n\nSo over each 1/2 interval, h(x) has two peaks at the midpoints (1/4, 3/4, etc.) and valleys at 1/12, 5/12, etc.\n\nSo h(x) is a periodic function with period 1/2, and each period consists of two triangles.\n\nSo h(x) = || sin(2\u03c0x) | - 1/2 | is a function that oscillates between 0 and 1/2, with period 1/2.\n\nNow, the next step is to compute 4 g(h(x)).\n\nSince g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|, let's see how g acts on h(x).\n\nSo first, h(x) ranges between 0 and 1/2. So g(h(x)) is || h(x) | - 1/4 |.\n\nBut since h(x) is non-negative, it's the same as | h(x) - 1/4 |.\n\nSo let's compute g(h(x)):\n\ng(h(x)) = | h(x) - 1/4 |.\n\nSo when h(x) >= 1/4, g(h(x)) = h(x) - 1/4.\n\nWhen h(x) < 1/4, g(h(x)) = 1/4 - h(x).\n\nSo let's see what this looks like.\n\nSince h(x) varies between 0 and 1/2, g(h(x)) will vary between 0 and 1/4.\n\nWhen h(x) is above 1/4, g(h(x)) is h(x) - 1/4. So it's a line with slope 1, starting at (h=1/4, g=0) and going up to h=1/2, which gives g=1/4.\n\nWhen h(x) is below 1/4, g(h(x)) = 1/4 - h(x), which is a line with slope -1, going from (h=0, g=1/4) down to (h=1/4, g=0).\n\nSo g(h(x)) is a V shape that goes from 1/4 down to 0 when h(x) goes from 0 to 1/4, and then up again to 1/4 when h(x) goes back to 1/2.\n\nSo 4*g(h(x)) would scale this by 4, so the range becomes 0 to 1.

So 4g(h(x)) = 4*(1/4 - h(x)).\n\nSo at x=0, h=1/2, so 4g=4*(1/4 - 1/2)=4*(-1/4)=-1.",

So |sin(2\u03c0x)| goes from 0 to 1 and back to 0 as x goes from 0 to 1/2, then again from 0 to 1 and back to 0 as x goes from 1/2 to 1.\n\nSo, |sin(2\u03c0x)| is a wave that has two peaks at x=1/4 and x=3/4, each reaching 1.\n\nThen, f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|) = ||sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2|. Let's think about this.\n\nFor |sin(2\u03c0x)| >= 1/2, f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|) = |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2. So when |sin(2\u03c0x)| is between 1/2 and 1, f gives |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2, which is between 0 and 1/2.\n\nWhen |sin(2\u03c0x)| < 1/2, f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|) = 1/2 - |sin(2\u03c0x)|, which is between 0 and 1/2 as well.\n\nSo, f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|) is a function that varies between 0 and 1/2. Specifically, it will have a V-shape in each interval where |sin(2\u03c0x)| is above or below 1/2.\n\nThen, g is applied to this.

So the output of g is between 0 and 1/4.\n\nThen, multiplying by 4, h(x) = 4g(...) will be between 0 and 1.\n\nSo, h(x) is a function from [0,1] to [0,1], and it's periodic with period 1.\n\nSimilarly, k(y) = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) is a function from [0,1] to [0,1], and it's periodic with period 2/3 since cos(3\u03c0y) has period 2/3.

Let's try to break that down.\n\nFirst, cos(3\u03c0y) has a period of 2/3, so in y \u2208 [0,2/3], it goes from 1 to -1 and back to 1.\n\nLet me consider y \u2208 [0,2/3]:\n\ncos(3\u03c0y) = cos(3\u03c0y), which at y=0 is 1, at y=1/3 is -1, and at y=2/3 is 1.\n\nThen, f(cos(3\u03c0y)) = | |cos(3\u03c0y)| - 1/2 |.\n\nSo, when |cos(3\u03c0y)| \u2265 1/2, f(...) = |cos(3\u03c0y)| - 1/2; else, 1/2 - |cos(3\u03c0y)|.\n\nSo, |cos(3\u03c0y)| = 1/2 when cos(3\u03c0y) = \u00b11/2.

So, to find all intersections, perhaps I can find the number of intersections in a fundamental region and then multiply by the number of repetitions.\n\nBut maybe I should first understand what the functions y = 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) look like.\n\nLet me try to graph y = 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) first.\n\nAs I said, sin(2\u03c0x) has a period of 1, and it's a sine wave oscillating between -1 and 1.\n\nThen, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = | |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 |.\n\nSo, since sin(2\u03c0x) is between -1 and 1, |sin(2\u03c0x)| is between 0 and 1. So, |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 can be negative or positive.\n\nSpecifically, when |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2265 1/2, the expression is non-negative. When |sin(2\u03c0x)| < 1/2, it's negative, so taking absolute value would flip it. Therefore, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is a function that is 1/2 - |sin(2\u03c0x)| when |sin(2\u03c0x)| < 1/2, and |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 when |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2265 1/2.\n\nThen, g is applied to that. So, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is in [0, 1/2], as earlier. Then, g of that is | |f(sin(2\u03c0x))| - 1/4 |.",

Taking absolute value, f will map this to [0, 1/2].\n\nSo, when |cos(3\u03c0y)| >= 1/2, f(|cos(3\u03c0y)|) = |cos(3\u03c0y)| - 1/2, which is between 0 and 1/2.\n\nWhen |cos(3\u03c0y)| < 1/2, f(|cos(3\u03c0y)|) = 1/2 - |cos(3\u03c0y)|, also between 0 and 1/2.\n\nSo, f(|cos(3\u03c0y)|) is a function that varies between 0 and 1/2, similar to f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|).\n\nThen, g is applied to this, so g(f(|cos(3\u03c0y)|)) is ||f(|cos(3\u03c0y)|) - 1/4|.\n\nAs before, for the input to g being in [0, 1/2], g(z) will be 1/4 - z when z < 1/4, and z - 1/4 when z >= 1/4. So the output is between 0 and 1/4.\n\nThen, multiplied by 4, k(y) = 4g(f(|cos(3\u03c0y)|)) is between 0 and 1.\n\nSo, now we have h(x) and k(y) both mapping [0,1] to [0,1].\n\nNow, the equations are y = h(x) and x = k(y). So to find their intersections, we can think of this as a system where each x and y depend on each other.\n\nBut how do these functions behave? Let me try to understand their graphs.\n\nFirst, h(x) = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))).\n\nWe can think of h(x) as a function that, for each x, takes sin(2\u03c0x), applies f and g, and scales by 4.\n\nSimilarly, k(y) = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nBut since sin and cos are involved, and with different frequencies, the functions h(x) and k(y) may have different periodicities and shapes.",

Then, subtracting 1/2 shifts it down by 1/2, so |x| - 1/2. This would create a V-shape that's shifted down, with vertices at (0, -1/2). But since we take the absolute value of that, f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|, it would reflect any negative parts back up. \n\nSo, the graph of f(x):\n\n- For |x| >= 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2.\n- For |x| < 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so f(x) = -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|.\n\nSo, f(x) is a piecewise function:\n- f(x) = |x| - 1/2, when |x| >= 1/2.\n- f(x) = 1/2 - |x|, when |x| < 1/2.\n\nThis creates a W-shaped graph, I think.

So, f(x) is a combination of Vs, peaking at 1/2 in the middle and then going back down.\n\nSimilarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's analyze that.\n\ng(x) = ||x| - 1/4|.\n\nAgain, similar structure.

Start with sin(2\u03c0x). The sine function has a period of 1, since 2\u03c0x has period 1.

Then, |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 will range between -1/2 and 1/2.\n\nTaking the absolute value, f(sin(...)) = ||sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2|, so the output will be between 0 and 1/2.",

Taking the absolute value, the result would range from 0 to 1/4.\n\nSo, when f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is >= 1/4, g(f(...)) is f(...) - 1/4, which is non-negative. When f(...) < 1/4, g(f(...)) is 1/4 - f(...).\n\nSo, the function g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) will oscillate between 0 and 1/4. Where does it reach its maximum?\n\nIt reaches 1/4 when f(...) is either 0 or 1/2. Because when f(...) is 0, g(f(...)) is 1/4 - 0 = 1/4. When f(...) is 1/2, g(f(...)) is 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4. So the maximum of 1/4 occurs at the points where f(...) is either 0 or 1/2.\n\nAnd the minimum of 0 occurs when f(...) is 1/4.\n\nSo, since f(...) is 1/4 when |sin(2\u03c0x)| = 3/4 or 1/4.",

So, these are transformed versions of sine and cosine functions, passed through f and g, scaled by 4.\n\nSo, let's see. For the first equation, y is a function of x: y =4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))). The second equation is x =4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))). So, to find the intersections, we need points (x,y) that satisfy both equations.\n\nIn other words, for such a point, y must equal 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))), and x must equal 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nSo, substituting y from the first equation into the second, we get x = 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0 * [4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x)))] ))).\n\nHmm, that seems really complicated. Maybe instead, I can think about the ranges and possible values.\n\nFirst, let's analyze f(sin(2\u03c0x)).\n\nSince sin(2\u03c0x) ranges between -1 and 1.\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = || sin(2\u03c0x) | - 1/2 |.\n\nSimilarly, since |sin(2\u03c0x)| is between 0 and 1, so | |sin(2\u03c0x)| -1/2 |.\n\nWhat does this function look like? Let's let t = |sin(2\u03c0x)|, which is between 0 and 1.\n\nThen f(t) = |t - 1/2|.\n\nSo, when t >=1/2, f(t) = t -1/2, and when t <1/2, f(t)=1/2 -t.\n\nSo f(t) is a V-shape with vertex at t=1/2, f(t)=0, and it goes up to f(0)=1/2, f(1)=1/2.\n\nSo f(t) ranges from 0 to 1/2.\n\nThen, g(f(t)) is computed as g(s), where s = f(t) \u2208 [0, 1/2].\n\ng(s) = ||s| -1/4|.\n\nBut since s is between 0 and 1/2, |s| is just s.\n\nSo g(s) = |s -1/4|.\n\nSo when s <1/4, g(s)=1/4 -s.\n\nWhen s >=1/4, g(s)=s -1/4.\n\nSo g(s) ranges from 0 (at s=1/4) to 1/4 (at s=0 and s=1/2).\n\nSo, g(f(t)) = | |s| -1/4 |, which is |s -1/4|.\n\nSo, for s in [0,1/4], g(s)=1/4 -s. For s in [1/4,1/2], g(s)=s -1/4.\n\nHence, the maximum value of g(f(t)) is 1/4.\n\nSo, 4*g(f(t)) will have a maximum of 4*(1/4)=1, and minimum 0.\n\nThus, y =4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) will have y ranging between 0 and 1.\n\nSimilarly, in the second equation, x=4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nLet me analyze this as well.\n\nFirst, cos(3\u03c0y) is a function of y, ranges between -1 and 1.\n\nSo, f(cos(3\u03c0y)) = ||cos(3\u03c0y)| -1/2|, same as before.\n\nLet me write t = |cos(3\u03c0y)|, which is between 0 and 1.\n\nf(t)=|t -1/2|, same as before.\n\nSo f(t) ranges between 0 and 1/2.\n\nThen, g(f(t)) is |s -1/4| where s = f(t) \u2208 [0,1/2].\n\nSo, same as before, g(s) ranges between 0 (at s=1/4) and 1/4 (at s=0 and s=1/2).\n\nThus, 4*g(f(t)) is between 0 and 1.\n\nSo, both y and x in the equations are between 0 and1.\n\nSo, the graphs are in the unit square [0,1]x[0,1].\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

          "text1": "Alternatively, perhaps I can find the range of f(sin(2\u03c0x)) and then see how g acts on that.\n\nSince sin(2\u03c0x) is between -1 and 1. Let's compute f(sin(2\u03c0x)):\n\nLet s = sin(2\u03c0x). So s is between -1 and 1. Then, |s| is between 0 and 1. Then, |s| - 1/2 is between -1/2 and 1/2. Taking absolute value, f(s) = ||s| - 1/2|.\n\nSo for |s| >= 1/2, f(s) = |s| - 1/2. For |s| < 1/2, f(s) = 1/2 - |s|.\n\nSo f(s) will vary between 0 and 1/2. Because when |s| = 1, f(s) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. When |s| = 1/2, f(s) = 0. When |s| is between 0 and 1/2, f(s) increases from 0 to 1/2 as |s| decreases from 1/2 to 0.\n\nSo f(s) has a maximum of 1/2 and a minimum of 0. So f(s) is in [0, 1/2].\n\nThen, g(f(s)) is g applied to [0, 1/2]. Let me compute g(t) where t is in [0, 1/2]. g(t) = ||t| - 1/4|.\n\nSince t is non-negative, |t| = t. So g(t) = |t - 1/4|.\n\nSo for t >= 1/4, g(t) = t - 1/4. For t < 1/4, g(t) = 1/4 - t.\n\nTherefore, g(t) is a V-shape with vertex at t=1/4, g(t)=0. It goes up on both sides. So when t is 0, g(t) = 1/4; when t is 1/2, g(t) = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.\n\nSo g(f(s)) is equal to |f(s) - 1/4|. But since f(s) is between 0 and 1/2, and 1/4 is within that interval, g(f(s)) will have a V shape. When f(s) < 1/4, g(f(s)) = 1/4 - f(s). When f(s) >=1/4, g(f(s)) = f(s) - 1/4.\n\nSo then, 4 * g(f(s)) is 4 * |f(s) - 1/4|.\n\nSo 4 * g(f(s)) can be written as:\n\nIf f(s) < 1/4: 4*(1/4 - f(s)) = 1 - 4 f(s)\n\nIf f(s) >=1/4: 4*(f(s) - 1/4) = 4 f(s) -1\n\nSo 4 g(f(s)) is a piecewise function with two linear parts.\n\nBut since f(s) is a function of sin(2\u03c0x), which is periodic, we can think about the behavior over each period.\n\nSimilarly, for the other equation, x =4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))), it's symmetric but with cos(3\u03c0y) instead of sin(2\u03c0x). Let me analyze that.\n\nLet me write down expressions for both y and x.\n\nFirst equation: y =4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x)))\n\nSecond equation: x =4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y)))\n\nSo each variable is expressed in terms of the other, but with different functions inside.\n\nI need to find the number of intersection points (x,y) that satisfy both equations.\n\nSo for each (x,y), y =4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) and x =4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).",
          "text2": "Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of |t|: Let me denote |t| as s, so s \u2208 [0,1]. Then f(t) = |s - 1/2|.\n\nSo, s is from 0 to 1. When s < 1/2, f(t) = 1/2 - s. When s >= 1/2, f(t) = s - 1/2.\n\nSo, as s increases from 0 to 1/2, f decreases from 1/2 to 0, and then as s increases from 1/2 to 1, f increases from 0 to 1/2.\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) will have this behavior as sin(2\u03c0x) varies between -1 and 1.\n\nThen, g is applied to f(sin(2\u03c0x)). So, g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) is equal to ||f(sin(2\u03c0x))| - 1/4|.\n\nBut since f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is always non-negative (because it's an absolute value), this is just |f(sin(2\u03c0x)) - 1/4|.\n\nSo, let's let u = f(sin(2\u03c0x)). Then g(u) = |u - 1/4|.\n\nSo, when u >= 1/4, g(u) = u - 1/4. When u < 1/4, g(u) = 1/4 - u.\n\nSo, combining this, we have:\n\ng(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) = |f(sin(2\u03c0x)) - 1/4|.\n\nBut f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is | |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 |.\n\nLet me try to find the range of f(sin(2\u03c0x)):\n\nsin(2\u03c0x) ranges from -1 to 1.\n\nSo, |sin(2\u03c0x)| ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nThen, | |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 | = f(sin(2\u03c0x)).\n\nSo, when |sin(2\u03c0x)| is 0, f is 1/2. When |sin(2\u03c0x)| is 1, f is 1/2 as well. At |sin(2\u03c0x)| = 1/2, f is 0.\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) ranges from 0 to 1/2.\n\nTherefore, u = f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is in [0, 1/2].\n\nSo, when u is in [0,1/4), g(u) = 1/4 - u.\n\nWhen u is in [1/4,1/2], g(u) = u - 1/4.\n\nSo, g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) is a piecewise function depending on the value of u.\n\nSo, let's consider the two cases:\n\n1. When u >= 1/4 (i.e., f(sin(2\u03c0x)) >= 1/4), then g(u) = u - 1/4.\n\n2. When u < 1/4, g(u) = 1/4 - u.\n\nSo, for y = 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))), we can write:\n\ny = 4 * [ (f(sin(2\u03c0x)) - 1/4) if f(sin(2\u03c0x)) >=1/4 else (1/4 - f(sin(2\u03c0x))) ]\n\nSo, substituting f(sin(2\u03c0x)):\n\nf(sin(2\u03c0x)) = | |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 |.\n\nLet me denote |sin(2\u03c0x)| as s, so s \u2208 [0,1].\n\nSo, f = |s - 1/2|.\n\nSo, f >=1/4 when |s - 1/2| >=1/4.\n\nWhich implies s -1/2 >=1/4 or s -1/2 <= -1/4.\n\nWhich gives s >= 3/4 or s <= 1/4.\n\nSince s is non-negative, s <=1/4 is when s is between 0 and 1/4.\n\nSo, for s in [0,1/4] or [3/4,1], g(f) is f -1/4.\n\nAnd for s in (1/4,3/4), g(f) is 1/4 - f.\n\nBut f is |s -1/2|, so when s is in [0,1/4], f = 1/2 - s, which is in [1/4,1/2].",

For x <=0, since it's |x|, it becomes |(-x) -1/4| = |x +1/4|. So, for x between -1/4 and 0, it's -x -1/4, and for x <= -1/4, it's -x -1/4.

The sine function has a period of 2\u03c0/(2\u03c0)=1. So, sin(2\u03c0x) has a period of 1. It oscillates between -1 and 1.\n\nThen, f is applied to sin(2\u03c0x), so f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = || sin(2\u03c0x) | - 1/2|. Let's think about the range of sin(2\u03c0x): it's between -1 and 1. So, |sin(2\u03c0x)| is between 0 and 1.\n\nThen, subtracting 1/2: |sin(2\u03c0x)| -1/2 can be between -1/2 and 1/2.

Since x < -1/4, x +1/4 is negative, so g(x)= -(x +1/4) = -x -1/4.\n\nSo the graph of g(x) is similar to f(x) but with different breakpoints at x=1/4 and x=-1/4.

Now, the functions in the problem are y = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nHmm. So both functions involve nesting f and g, but one is applied to sin(2\u03c0x) and the other to cos(3\u03c0y). Also, one is multiplied by 4 and equals y, and the other equals x.\n\nThis seems complex, so maybe I should try to understand the range of these functions first.\n\nLet me try to figure out the possible outputs of f(sin(2\u03c0x)) and then g of that.\n\nFirst, since sin(2\u03c0x) ranges between -1 and 1.

Let me compute the possible range of f(sin(2\u03c0x)).\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = || sin(2\u03c0x) | - 1/2 |.\n\nThe inner |sin(2\u03c0x)| ranges from 0 to 1. So |sin(2\u03c0x)| -1/2 ranges from -1/2 to 1/2. Then taking absolute makes it range from 0 to 1/2. So f(sin(2\u03c0x)) ranges between 0 and 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, then g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) = || f(sin(2\u03c0x)) -1/4 |.\n\nSince f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is between 0 and 1/2, let's see:\n\nIf f(sin(...)) >=1/4, then g(...) = f(...) -1/4.\n\nIf f(...) <1/4, then g(...) = 1/4 - f(...).\n\nSo the range of g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) is from 0 to 1/4.\n\nBecause when f(...) is in [0,1/4), g(...) is 1/4 - f(...), which decreases from 1/4 to 0.\n\nWhen f(...) is in [1/4,1/2], g(...) is f(...) -1/4, which increases from 0 to 1/4.\n\nSo g(f(...)) ranges from 0 to 1/4.\n\nThen, 4g(f(...)) would range from 0 to 1.\n\nSimilarly, for the other function: x =4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nSame reasoning applies. cos(3\u03c0y) ranges between -1 and 1, so f(cos(...)) ranges between 0 and 1/2, then g(f(...)) ranges between 0 and 1/4, so 4g(...) ranges between 0 and1.\n\nSo both y and x in the equations range between 0 and1.

The next step is to understand the composite functions involved in the given equations.\n\nFirst equation: y = 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))).\n\nLet me parse this. The outer function is 4 times g of f of sin(2\u03c0x). Similarly, the second equation is x = 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nSo let's understand the inner functions step by step.\n\nLet me first analyze the function h(x) = f(sin(2\u03c0x)). Since sin(2\u03c0x) is a sine wave oscillating between -1 and 1 with period 1 (since 2\u03c0x has period 1). So h(x) = f(sin(2\u03c0x)).\n\nSince f is applied to sin(2\u03c0x), which ranges between -1 and 1, let's see how f behaves on this interval.\n\nGiven f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|, as we saw earlier. So for x in [-1,1], |x| is in [0,1]. So |x| - 1/2 is in [-1/2, 1/2]. Then, taking absolute value again.\n\nSo f(x) in this case would be:\n\n- For |x| >= 1/2 (which, since x is in [-1,1], that's when |x| >= 1/2), f(x) = |x| - 1/2.\n- For |x| < 1/2, f(x) = 1/2 - |x|.\n\nSo when x is in [-1,1], f(x) is a diamond shape as we discussed earlier.\n\nSo h(x) = f(sin(2\u03c0x)) will take sin(2\u03c0x) and apply f. Let's consider the range of sin(2\u03c0x): it's between -1 and 1, so h(x) will be f evaluated at points in [-1,1].\n\nSo let's compute f(sin(2\u03c0x)).\n\nFor a given x, sin(2\u03c0x) is in [-1,1], so |sin(2\u03c0x)| is in [0,1]. Then |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 is in [-1/2, 1/2]. So f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is the absolute value of that, which is:\n\n- If |sin(2\u03c0x)| >= 1/2, then f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2.\n- If |sin(2\u03c0x)| < 1/2, then f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = 1/2 - |sin(2\u03c0x)|.\n\nSo f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is a function that when sin(2\u03c0x) is above 1/2 or below -1/2, it subtracts 1/2, otherwise, it's 1/2 minus |sin(2\u03c0x)|.\n\nBut since sin(2\u03c0x) is symmetric, and absolute value is applied, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of |sin(2\u03c0x)|.\n\nSo h(x) = f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is equal to:\n\nh(x) = | | |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 | | ?",

[0,0.0402): y = 1 - 4 sin(2\u03c0x)\n2. [0.0402,1/12): y = 4 sin(2\u03c0x) - 1\n3. [1/12,0.135): y = 3 - 4 sin(2\u03c0x)\n4. [0.135,5/12): y = 4 sin(2\u03c0x) - 3\n5.

Let's try to break that down.\n\nFirst, cos(3\u03c0y) has a period of 2/3, so in y \u2208 [0,2/3], it goes from 1 to -1 and back to 1.\n\nLet me consider y \u2208 [0,2/3]:\n\ncos(3\u03c0y) = cos(3\u03c0y), which at y=0 is 1, at y=1/3 is -1, and at y=2/3 is 1.\n\nThen, f(cos(3\u03c0y)) = | |cos(3\u03c0y)| - 1/2 |.\n\nSo, when |cos(3\u03c0y)| \u2265 1/2, f(...) = |cos(3\u03c0y)| - 1/2; else, 1/2 - |cos(3\u03c0y)|.\n\nSo, |cos(3\u03c0y)| = 1/2 when cos(3\u03c0y) = \u00b11/2. So, 3\u03c0y = \u00b1\u03c0/3 + 2\u03c0k \u2192 y = \u00b11/9 + 2k/3.\n\nBut since y is between 0 and 2/3, the critical points are y=1/9 \u2248 0.1111 and y=5/9 \u2248 0.5556.\n\nSo, in y \u2208 [0,1/9], |cos(3\u03c0y)| is decreasing from 1 to 1/2.\n\nIn y \u2208 [1/9,5/9], |cos(3\u03c0y)| is decreasing to 0 and then increasing back to 1/2.",

So, 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) would have period 2/3 in y, so x is periodic with period 2/3 in y.\n\nHmm. So, the graph of y is a function with period 1 in x, and x is a function with period 2/3 in y. So, to find all intersections, perhaps I can find the number of intersections in a fundamental region and then multiply by the number of repetitions.\n\nBut maybe I should first understand what the functions y = 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) look like.\n\nLet me try to graph y = 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) first.\n\nAs I said, sin(2\u03c0x) has a period of 1, and it's a sine wave oscillating between -1 and 1.\n\nThen, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = | |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 |.\n\nSo, since sin(2\u03c0x) is between -1 and 1, |sin(2\u03c0x)| is between 0 and 1. So, |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 can be negative or positive.\n\nSpecifically, when |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2265 1/2, the expression is non-negative. When |sin(2\u03c0x)| < 1/2, it's negative, so taking absolute value would flip it. Therefore, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is a function that is 1/2 - |sin(2\u03c0x)| when |sin(2\u03c0x)| < 1/2, and |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 when |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2265 1/2.\n\nThen, g is applied to that. So, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is in [0, 1/2], as earlier. Then, g of that is | |f(sin(2\u03c0x))| - 1/4 |.",

Let me try to find the number of solutions by considering the periods and the number of times the functions can cross.\n\nGiven that sin(2\u03c0x) has a period of 1, and inside f and g, the function y=4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) has a certain number of oscillations.\n\nSimilarly, cos(3\u03c0y) has a period of 2/3, so x=4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) has a certain number of oscillations in y.\n\nLet me think about the first function, y=4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))).\n\nWe can break this down:\n\n- sin(2\u03c0x) has a period of 1, going through a full cycle every unit x.\n- f(sin(2\u03c0x)) has a period of 1/2 because the inner function is sin(2\u03c0x), which has a period of 1, but f is applied, which may cause the period to be halved.\n- Then, g(f(...)) would have the same period as f(...), so 1/2.\n- Then scaling by 4, the period remains 1/2.\n\nSo y=4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) has a period of 1/2, so it repeats every 1/2 units.\n\nSimilarly, x=4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) would involve cos(3\u03c0y), which has a period of 2/3.\n\nSo the function x=4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) has a period of 2/(3*2)=1/3?",
          "text2": "Wait, let's think about the periods. The function y is a function of x with period 1, since sin(2\u03c0x) has period 1. Similarly, the function x is a function of y with period 1/3, because cos(3\u03c0y) has period 2/3, and taking absolute value halves it to 1/3.\n\nSo, the entire system has a period of 1, as both functions have periods that divide 1.\n\nTherefore, the number of intersections in the unit square [0,1]x[0,1] should repeat every unit in both x and y.\n\nThus, perhaps I can focus on the unit square and count all intersections there, and that count will be the total.\n\nSo, my goal is to find the number of solutions (x, y) in [0,1]x[0,1] satisfying both equations.\n\nNow, to find this, I can think about how the functions behave.\n\nFirst, let's analyze y = 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))).\n\nLet me consider the inner functions step by step.\n\nStarting with sin(2\u03c0x).

As z increases to 1/2, f(z) decreases to 0. Then, as z increases beyond 1/2, f(z) increases back to 1/2.\n\nThen, g(f(z)) = |f(z) - 1/4|.\n\nSo, when f(z) is less than 1/4, g(f(z)) = 1/4 - f(z). When f(z) is greater than or equal to 1/4, g(f(z)) = f(z) - 1/4.\n\nSo, let's analyze f(z):\n\nf(z) = |z - 1/2|, which is 1/2 - z when z <= 1/2, and z - 1/2 when z >= 1/2.\n\nSo, f(z) is a V-shaped function with minimum at z=1/2.\n\nThen, g(f(z)) is |f(z) - 1/4|.\n\nSo, when f(z) is between 0 and 1/4, g(f(z)) = 1/4 - f(z).\n\nWhen f(z) is between 1/4 and 1/2, g(f(z)) = f(z) - 1/4.\n\nSo, the graph of g(f(z)) will have a V-shape itself, peaking at f(z)=1/4.\n\nSo, when f(z) is at 1/4, g(f(z)) is zero.",

          "text2": "Wait, f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. Let me consider different intervals.\n\nFor x >= 0, |x| =x. So f(x) = |x - 1/2|.

So, for x <=0, it's another V-shape with vertex at x = -1/2.\n\nSo overall, f(x) is a W-shaped graph, with minima at x= -1/2, 1/2, where the value is 0, and it peaks at x=0, where |0 -1/2|=1/2. So the graph of f(x) is like two Vs back-to-back, creating a W.\n\nSimilarly, g(x) = ||x| -1/4|. Same reasoning: for x >=0, g(x)=|x -1/4|. So vertex at x=1/4, and for x <=0, g(x) = |-x -1/4| = |x +1/4|, vertex at x=-1/4.\n\nSo g(x) is also a W-shaped graph, but with minima at x=1/4, -1/4, and peaks at x=0 with value 1/4.\n\nSo, f(x) has minima at \u00b11/2 and peaks at 0, x=0, and g(x) has minima at \u00b11/4 and peaks at 0.\n\nNow, the functions are y =4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) and x=4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))). So, these are transformed versions of sine and cosine functions, passed through f and g, scaled by 4.\n\nSo, let's see. For the first equation, y is a function of x: y =4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))). The second equation is x =4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))). So, to find the intersections, we need points (x,y) that satisfy both equations.\n\nIn other words, for such a point, y must equal 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))), and x must equal 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nSo, substituting y from the first equation into the second, we get x = 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0 * [4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x)))] ))).\n\nHmm, that seems really complicated. Maybe instead, I can think about the ranges and possible values.\n\nFirst, let's analyze f(sin(2\u03c0x)).\n\nSince sin(2\u03c0x) ranges between -1 and 1.\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = || sin(2\u03c0x) | - 1/2 |.\n\nSimilarly, since |sin(2\u03c0x)| is between 0 and 1, so | |sin(2\u03c0x)| -1/2 |.\n\nWhat does this function look like? Let's let t = |sin(2\u03c0x)|, which is between 0 and 1.\n\nThen f(t) = |t - 1/2|.\n\nSo, when t >=1/2, f(t) = t -1/2, and when t <1/2, f(t)=1/2 -t.\n\nSo f(t) is a V-shape with vertex at t=1/2, f(t)=0, and it goes up to f(0)=1/2, f(1)=1/2.\n\nSo f(t) ranges from 0 to 1/2.\n\nThen, g(f(t)) is computed as g(s), where s = f(t) \u2208 [0, 1/2].\n\ng(s) = ||s| -1/4|.\n\nBut since s is between 0 and 1/2, |s| is just s.\n\nSo g(s) = |s -1/4|.\n\nSo when s <1/4, g(s)=1/4 -s.\n\nWhen s >=1/4, g(s)=s -1/4.\n\nSo g(s) ranges from 0 (at s=1/4) to 1/4 (at s=0 and s=1/2).\n\nSo, g(f(t)) = | |s| -1/4 |, which is |s -1/4|.\n\nSo, for s in [0,1/4], g(s)=1/4 -s. For s in [1/4,1/2], g(s)=s -1/4.\n\nHence, the maximum value of g(f(t)) is 1/4.\n\nSo, 4*g(f(t)) will have a maximum of 4*(1/4)=1, and minimum 0.\n\nThus, y =4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) will have y ranging between 0 and 1.\n\nSimilarly, in the second equation, x=4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nLet me analyze this as well.\n\nFirst, cos(3\u03c0y) is a function of y, ranges between -1 and 1.\n\nSo, f(cos(3\u03c0y)) = ||cos(3\u03c0y)| -1/2|, same as before.\n\nLet me write t = |cos(3\u03c0y)|, which is between 0 and 1.\n\nf(t)=|t -1/2|, same as before.\n\nSo f(t) ranges between 0 and 1/2.\n\nThen, g(f(t)) is |s -1/4| where s = f(t) \u2208 [0,1/2].\n\nSo, same as before, g(s) ranges between 0 (at s=1/4) and 1/4 (at s=0 and s=1/2).\n\nThus, 4*g(f(t)) is between 0 and 1.\n\nSo, both y and x in the equations are between 0 and1.\n\nSo, the graphs are in the unit square [0,1]x[0,1].\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

When |s| = 1/2, f(s) = 0. When |s| is between 0 and 1/2, f(s) increases from 0 to 1/2 as |s| decreases from 1/2 to 0.\n\nSo f(s) has a maximum of 1/2 and a minimum of 0.

When s >= 1/2, f(t) = s - 1/2.\n\nSo, as s increases from 0 to 1/2, f decreases from 1/2 to 0, and then as s increases from 1/2 to 1, f increases from 0 to 1/2.\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) will have this behavior as sin(2\u03c0x) varies between -1 and 1.\n\nThen, g is applied to f(sin(2\u03c0x)).

So, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is periodic with period 1.\n\nSimilarly, g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) would also have period 1.\n\nSo, the function y = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) is periodic with period 1. So, to understand y, I can analyze it over an interval of length 1, say from x = 0 to x = 1, and then the pattern repeats.\n\nSimilarly, in the second equation, x = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nSo, cos(3\u03c0y) is involved here. Let's think about that. cos(3\u03c0y) is a function of y, and y is the variable here. So, the function f(cos(3\u03c0y)) would be a function of y, and then g of that, and then scaled by 4.\n\nSo, let's think about how x is defined in terms of y. So, x is a function of y, given by x = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nSimilarly, this function is periodic? Let's see. cos(3\u03c0y) has period 2/3 because cos has period 2\u03c0, and with 3\u03c0y, the period is (2\u03c0)/(3\u03c0) = 2/3. So, cos(3\u03c0(y + 2/3)) = cos(3\u03c0y + 2\u03c0) = cos(3\u03c0y). So, the period is 2/3.\n\nSo, for the second equation, x = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))), this function is periodic with period 2/3 in y.\n\nSo, both equations have periodicity, but in different variables. The first equation is periodic in x with period 1, and the second is periodic in y with period 2/3.\n\nSo, perhaps the whole system repeats every certain interval.\n\nBut since we're looking for intersections, which would correspond to solutions (x, y) where both equations are satisfied, perhaps we can find the number of solutions in a fundamental domain and then multiply by the number of periods, but maybe it's not straightforward because the periods are different.",

So, correcting that, f(x) has a V shape between x = -1/2 and 1/2, peaking at (0,1/2), and then two Vs beyond that, each dipping to zero at x = \u00b11/2. Hmm, maybe I should draw it.\n\nSimilarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's analyze this. For x >=0, g(x) = |x -1/4|. So, for x between 0 and 1/4, it's 1/4 - x, and for x >=1/4, it's x -1/4. For x <=0, since it's |x|, it becomes |(-x) -1/4| = |x +1/4|. So, for x between -1/4 and 0, it's -x -1/4, and for x <= -1/4, it's -x -1/4. Therefore, g(x) is a V shape at x =0, peaking at (0,1/4), dipping down to 0 at x=\u00b11/4, and then increasing again beyond that.\n\nSo, both f and g are piecewise linear functions with multiple segments.\n\nNow, the functions inside the problem are transformations of these. Let me look at the first function: y = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))).\n\nSo, this is a composition of functions. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, start with sin(2\u03c0x). The sine function has a period of 2\u03c0/(2\u03c0)=1. So, sin(2\u03c0x) has a period of 1. It oscillates between -1 and 1.\n\nThen, f is applied to sin(2\u03c0x), so f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = || sin(2\u03c0x) | - 1/2|. Let's think about the range of sin(2\u03c0x): it's between -1 and 1. So, |sin(2\u03c0x)| is between 0 and 1.\n\nThen, subtracting 1/2: |sin(2\u03c0x)| -1/2 can be between -1/2 and 1/2. Taking the absolute value of that gives f(sin(2\u03c0x)) as || sin(2\u03c0x) | -1/2 |, which is between 0 and 1/2.\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) varies between 0 and 1/2.\n\nThen, g is applied to this result: g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) = || f(sin(2\u03c0x)) | -1/4 |.",
          "text2": "Wait, if x is between -1/4 and 0, then -x is between 0 and 1/4. So -x -1/4 is between -1/4 and 0. So it's negative, so the absolute value is -( -x -1/4 )= x +1/4.\n\nCase4: x < -1/4: |x| = -x, so g(x) = |-x -1/4| = |x +1/4|. Since x < -1/4, x +1/4 is negative, so g(x)= -(x +1/4) = -x -1/4.\n\nSo the graph of g(x) is similar to f(x) but with different breakpoints at x=1/4 and x=-1/4. So it's a V-shape that touches the x-axis at x=1/4 and x=-1/4, and has a peak at x=0 of height 1/4.\n\nOkay, so now I have f and g defined. Now, the functions in the problem are y = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nHmm. So both functions involve nesting f and g, but one is applied to sin(2\u03c0x) and the other to cos(3\u03c0y). Also, one is multiplied by 4 and equals y, and the other equals x.\n\nThis seems complex, so maybe I should try to understand the range of these functions first.\n\nLet me try to figure out the possible outputs of f(sin(2\u03c0x)) and then g of that.\n\nFirst, since sin(2\u03c0x) ranges between -1 and 1. Then f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is taking the absolute value, subtracting 1/2, then taking absolute again. Let me compute the possible range of f(sin(2\u03c0x)).\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = || sin(2\u03c0x) | - 1/2 |.\n\nThe inner |sin(2\u03c0x)| ranges from 0 to 1. So |sin(2\u03c0x)| -1/2 ranges from -1/2 to 1/2. Then taking absolute makes it range from 0 to 1/2. So f(sin(2\u03c0x)) ranges between 0 and 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, then g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) = || f(sin(2\u03c0x)) -1/4 |.\n\nSince f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is between 0 and 1/2, let's see:\n\nIf f(sin(...)) >=1/4, then g(...) = f(...) -1/4.\n\nIf f(...) <1/4, then g(...) = 1/4 - f(...).\n\nSo the range of g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) is from 0 to 1/4.\n\nBecause when f(...) is in [0,1/4), g(...) is 1/4 - f(...), which decreases from 1/4 to 0.\n\nWhen f(...) is in [1/4,1/2], g(...) is f(...) -1/4, which increases from 0 to 1/4.\n\nSo g(f(...)) ranges from 0 to 1/4.\n\nThen, 4g(f(...)) would range from 0 to 1.\n\nSimilarly, for the other function: x =4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nSame reasoning applies. cos(3\u03c0y) ranges between -1 and 1, so f(cos(...)) ranges between 0 and 1/2, then g(f(...)) ranges between 0 and 1/4, so 4g(...) ranges between 0 and1.\n\nSo both y and x in the equations range between 0 and1. So the possible points of intersection lie in the unit square [0,1]x[0,1].",

Let me think.\n\nSince sin(2\u03c0x) is periodic with period 1, and f and g are applied to it, but f and g are both even functions, meaning they only depend on |input|. So, sin(2\u03c0x) is an odd function, but after applying f and g, which take absolute values, the resulting function becomes even. So, y = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) is an even function in x, so it's symmetric about the y-axis.

So 4g(h(x)) = 4*(1/4 - h(x)).\n\nSo at x=0, h=1/2, so 4g=4*(1/4 - 1/2)=4*(-1/4)=-1.",

For s in [1/4,1/2], g(s)=s -1/4.\n\nSo, 4g(s) is 1 -4s for s <1/4 and 4s -1 for s \u22651/4.\n\nTherefore, y =4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) is equal to:\n\n- 1 -4f(sin(2\u03c0x)) when f(sin(2\u03c0x)) <1/4.\n\n- 4f(sin(2\u03c0x)) -1 when f(sin(2\u03c0x)) \u22651/4.\n\nSimilarly, for the x equation: x=4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nSame reasoning applies, but with cos(3\u03c0y) inside.\n\nSo, cos(3\u03c0y) has a period of 2/3, since the period of cos(ky) is 2\u03c0/k, so here k=3\u03c0, so period is 2\u03c0/(3\u03c0)=2/3.\n\nSo, cos(3\u03c0y) oscillates between -1 and1, completing a cycle every 2/3 units.\n\nThen, f(cos(3\u03c0y)) is ||cos(3\u03c0y)| -1/2|.\n\nSo again, when |cos(3\u03c0y)| is 0, f(t)=1/2; when |cos(3\u03c0y)|=1/2, f(t)=0.\n\nSo, f(cos(3\u03c0y)) will be a waveform that has zeros at points where |cos(3\u03c0y)|=1/2, which occurs at y= (1/3) arccos(1/2) + 2\u03c0k/3, but I need to think in terms of y in [0,1].",

Let's denote S = sin(2\u03c0x).\n\nThen, f(S) = | |S| - 1/2 |. So, this is the absolute value of |S| minus 1/2, then take absolute again.\n\nSo, f(S) = | |S| - 1/2 |.\n\nAs I thought earlier, when |S| \u2265 1/2, f(S) = |S| - 1/2. When |S| < 1/2, f(S) = 1/2 - |S|.\n\nSo, f(S) is a function that is V-shaped in regions where |S| is above 1/2 and inverted V-shaped where |S| is below 1/2.\n\nThen, g(f(S)) is | f(S) - 1/4 |.\n\nSince f(S) is between 0 and 1/2, as established earlier, so f(S) - 1/4 can be negative or positive.\n\nSo, when f(S) < 1/4, g(f(S)) = 1/4 - f(S). When f(S) \u2265 1/4, g(f(S)) = f(S) - 1/4.\n\nTherefore, 4 g(f(S)) would be:\n\n- If f(S) < 1/4: 4*(1/4 - f(S)) = 1 - 4 f(S)\n- If f(S) \u2265 1/4: 4*(f(S) - 1/4) = 4 f(S) - 1\n\nSo, y = 4 g(f(S)) is a piecewise function based on the value of f(S).\n\nNow, let's think about the shape of y as a function of x. Since sin(2\u03c0x) is periodic, and x is a continuous variable, y will have a periodic structure as well.\n\nBut perhaps I can find the maximum and minimum values of y.\n\nIn the first case, when f(S) < 1/4, y = 1 - 4 f(S). Since f(S) is between 0 and 1/4, y is between 1 - 0 = 1 and 1 - 4*(1/4) = 0. So, y ranges from 0 to 1 in this case.\n\nIn the second case, when f(S) \u2265 1/4, y = 4 f(S) - 1. Since f(S) is between 1/4 and 1/2, y ranges from 4*(1/4) - 1 = 0 to 4*(1/2) - 1 = 0.",

Maybe I can analyze the possible ranges and periodicity.\n\nFirst, let's consider the periods of the functions. The function sin(2\u03c0x) has a period of 1, so f(sin(2\u03c0x)) and then g of that would also have period 1. Similarly, 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) would inherit this period, so y is periodic with period 1 in x. So, y repeats every 1 unit along x.\n\nOn the other hand, the function cos(3\u03c0y) has a period of 2/3 in y. So, 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) would have period 2/3 in y, so x is periodic with period 2/3 in y.\n\nHmm. So, the graph of y is a function with period 1 in x, and x is a function with period 2/3 in y. So, to find all intersections, perhaps I can find the number of intersections in a fundamental region and then multiply by the number of repetitions.\n\nBut maybe I should first understand what the functions y = 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) look like.\n\nLet me try to graph y = 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) first.\n\nAs I said, sin(2\u03c0x) has a period of 1, and it's a sine wave oscillating between -1 and 1.\n\nThen, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = | |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 |.\n\nSo, since sin(2\u03c0x) is between -1 and 1, |sin(2\u03c0x)| is between 0 and 1. So, |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 can be negative or positive.\n\nSpecifically, when |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2265 1/2, the expression is non-negative. When |sin(2\u03c0x)| < 1/2, it's negative, so taking absolute value would flip it. Therefore, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is a function that is 1/2 - |sin(2\u03c0x)| when |sin(2\u03c0x)| < 1/2, and |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 when |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2265 1/2.\n\nThen, g is applied to that. So, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is in [0, 1/2], as earlier. Then, g of that is | |f(sin(2\u03c0x))| - 1/4 |.",

Let's compute f(sin(2\u03c0x)):\n\nLet s = sin(2\u03c0x). So s is between -1 and 1. Then, |s| is between 0 and 1. Then, |s| - 1/2 is between -1/2 and 1/2. Taking absolute value, f(s) = ||s| - 1/2|.\n\nSo for |s| >= 1/2, f(s) = |s| - 1/2. For |s| < 1/2, f(s) = 1/2 - |s|.\n\nSo f(s) will vary between 0 and 1/2. Because when |s| = 1, f(s) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. When |s| = 1/2, f(s) = 0. When |s| is between 0 and 1/2, f(s) increases from 0 to 1/2 as |s| decreases from 1/2 to 0.\n\nSo f(s) has a maximum of 1/2 and a minimum of 0.

So g(t) = |t - 1/4|.\n\nSo for t >= 1/4, g(t) = t - 1/4. For t < 1/4, g(t) = 1/4 - t.\n\nTherefore, g(t) is a V-shape with vertex at t=1/4, g(t)=0. It goes up on both sides. So when t is 0, g(t) = 1/4; when t is 1/2, g(t) = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.\n\nSo g(f(s)) is equal to |f(s) - 1/4|.

When f(s) >=1/4, g(f(s)) = f(s) - 1/4.\n\nSo then, 4 * g(f(s)) is 4 * |f(s) - 1/4|.\n\nSo 4 * g(f(s)) can be written as:\n\nIf f(s) < 1/4: 4*(1/4 - f(s)) = 1 - 4 f(s)\n\nIf f(s) >=1/4: 4*(f(s) - 1/4) = 4 f(s) -1\n\nSo 4 g(f(s)) is a piecewise function with two linear parts.\n\nBut since f(s) is a function of sin(2\u03c0x), which is periodic, we can think about the behavior over each period.\n\nSimilarly, for the other equation, x =4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))), it's symmetric but with cos(3\u03c0y) instead of sin(2\u03c0x).

So, g(...) will decrease with slope -1 until f=1/4, then increase with slope +1.\n\n4. From x=7/12 to x=11/12: f increases from0 to1/2.\n\n   Similar to the second interval, f starts below1/4 and increases to1/2.

Let's break this down.\n\nAgain, |cos(3\u03c0y)| is between 0 and 1. Subtracting 1/2, we get values between -1/2 and 1/2. Taking absolute value, f will map this to [0, 1/2].\n\nSo, when |cos(3\u03c0y)| >= 1/2, f(|cos(3\u03c0y)|) = |cos(3\u03c0y)| - 1/2, which is between 0 and 1/2.\n\nWhen |cos(3\u03c0y)| < 1/2, f(|cos(3\u03c0y)|) = 1/2 - |cos(3\u03c0y)|, also between 0 and 1/2.\n\nSo, f(|cos(3\u03c0y)|) is a function that varies between 0 and 1/2, similar to f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|).\n\nThen, g is applied to this, so g(f(|cos(3\u03c0y)|)) is ||f(|cos(3\u03c0y)|) - 1/4|.\n\nAs before, for the input to g being in [0, 1/2], g(z) will be 1/4 - z when z < 1/4, and z - 1/4 when z >= 1/4. So the output is between 0 and 1/4.\n\nThen, multiplied by 4, k(y) = 4g(f(|cos(3\u03c0y)|)) is between 0 and 1.\n\nSo, now we have h(x) and k(y) both mapping [0,1] to [0,1].\n\nNow, the equations are y = h(x) and x = k(y). So to find their intersections, we can think of this as a system where each x and y depend on each other.\n\nBut how do these functions behave? Let me try to understand their graphs.\n\nFirst, h(x) = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))).\n\nWe can think of h(x) as a function that, for each x, takes sin(2\u03c0x), applies f and g, and scales by 4.\n\nSimilarly, k(y) = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nBut since sin and cos are involved, and with different frequencies, the functions h(x) and k(y) may have different periodicities and shapes.",

Let's compute f(sin(2\u03c0x)):\n\nLet s = sin(2\u03c0x). So s is between -1 and 1. Then, |s| is between 0 and 1. Then, |s| - 1/2 is between -1/2 and 1/2. Taking absolute value, f(s) = ||s| - 1/2|.\n\nSo for |s| >= 1/2, f(s) = |s| - 1/2. For |s| < 1/2, f(s) = 1/2 - |s|.\n\nSo f(s) will vary between 0 and 1/2. Because when |s| = 1, f(s) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. When |s| = 1/2, f(s) = 0. When |s| is between 0 and 1/2, f(s) increases from 0 to 1/2 as |s| decreases from 1/2 to 0.\n\nSo f(s) has a maximum of 1/2 and a minimum of 0. So f(s) is in [0, 1/2].\n\nThen, g(f(s)) is g applied to [0, 1/2]. Let me compute g(t) where t is in [0, 1/2]. g(t) = ||t| - 1/4|.\n\nSince t is non-negative, |t| = t. So g(t) = |t - 1/4|.\n\nSo for t >= 1/4, g(t) = t - 1/4. For t < 1/4, g(t) = 1/4 - t.\n\nTherefore, g(t) is a V-shape with vertex at t=1/4, g(t)=0. It goes up on both sides. So when t is 0, g(t) = 1/4; when t is 1/2, g(t) = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.\n\nSo g(f(s)) is equal to |f(s) - 1/4|. But since f(s) is between 0 and 1/2, and 1/4 is within that interval, g(f(s)) will have a V shape. When f(s) < 1/4, g(f(s)) = 1/4 - f(s). When f(s) >=1/4, g(f(s)) = f(s) - 1/4.\n\nSo then, 4 * g(f(s)) is 4 * |f(s) - 1/4|.\n\nSo 4 * g(f(s)) can be written as:\n\nIf f(s) < 1/4: 4*(1/4 - f(s)) = 1 - 4 f(s)\n\nIf f(s) >=1/4: 4*(f(s) - 1/4) = 4 f(s) -1\n\nSo 4 g(f(s)) is a piecewise function with two linear parts.\n\nBut since f(s) is a function of sin(2\u03c0x), which is periodic, we can think about the behavior over each period.\n\nSimilarly, for the other equation, x =4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))), it's symmetric but with cos(3\u03c0y) instead of sin(2\u03c0x).

When s >= 1/2, f(t) = s - 1/2.\n\nSo, as s increases from 0 to 1/2, f decreases from 1/2 to 0, and then as s increases from 1/2 to 1, f increases from 0 to 1/2.\n\nSo, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) will have this behavior as sin(2\u03c0x) varies between -1 and 1.\n\nThen, g is applied to f(sin(2\u03c0x)).

Hmm, maybe I should draw it.\n\nSimilarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's analyze this. For x >=0, g(x) = |x -1/4|. So, for x between 0 and 1/4, it's 1/4 - x, and for x >=1/4, it's x -1/4. For x <=0, since it's |x|, it becomes |(-x) -1/4| = |x +1/4|. So, for x between -1/4 and 0, it's -x -1/4, and for x <= -1/4, it's -x -1/4. Therefore, g(x) is a V shape at x =0, peaking at (0,1/4), dipping down to 0 at x=\u00b11/4, and then increasing again beyond that.\n\nSo, both f and g are piecewise linear functions with multiple segments.\n\nNow, the functions inside the problem are transformations of these.

The function sin(2\u03c0x) has a period of 1, so f(sin(2\u03c0x)) and then g of that would also have period 1. Similarly, 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) would inherit this period, so y is periodic with period 1 in x.

Maybe I can analyze the possible ranges and periodicity.\n\nFirst, let's consider the periods of the functions. The function sin(2\u03c0x) has a period of 1, so f(sin(2\u03c0x)) and then g of that would also have period 1. Similarly, 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) would inherit this period, so y is periodic with period 1 in x. So, y repeats every 1 unit along x.\n\nOn the other hand, the function cos(3\u03c0y) has a period of 2/3 in y. So, 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) would have period 2/3 in y, so x is periodic with period 2/3 in y.\n\nHmm. So, the graph of y is a function with period 1 in x, and x is a function with period 2/3 in y. So, to find all intersections, perhaps I can find the number of intersections in a fundamental region and then multiply by the number of repetitions.\n\nBut maybe I should first understand what the functions y = 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) look like.\n\nLet me try to graph y = 4 g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) first.\n\nAs I said, sin(2\u03c0x) has a period of 1, and it's a sine wave oscillating between -1 and 1.\n\nThen, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = | |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 |.\n\nSo, since sin(2\u03c0x) is between -1 and 1, |sin(2\u03c0x)| is between 0 and 1. So, |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 can be negative or positive.\n\nSpecifically, when |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2265 1/2, the expression is non-negative. When |sin(2\u03c0x)| < 1/2, it's negative, so taking absolute value would flip it. Therefore, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is a function that is 1/2 - |sin(2\u03c0x)| when |sin(2\u03c0x)| < 1/2, and |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 when |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2265 1/2.\n\nThen, g is applied to that. So, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is in [0, 1/2], as earlier. Then, g of that is | |f(sin(2\u03c0x))| - 1/4 |.",

As z increases to 1/2, f(z) decreases to 0. Then, as z increases beyond 1/2, f(z) increases back to 1/2.\n\nThen, g(f(z)) = |f(z) - 1/4|.\n\nSo, when f(z) is less than 1/4, g(f(z)) = 1/4 - f(z).

Since this function is periodic in y with period 2/3, we can focus on y \u2208 [0, 2/3], and then the pattern repeats.\n\nBut since x is between 0 and 1, we can have multiple periods of the second function within y \u2208 [0,1], but perhaps it's better to analyze the entire range y \u2208 [0,1].",

The sine function has a period of 2\u03c0, but since it's sin(2\u03c0x), the period is 1. So it completes a full cycle every 1 unit along the x-axis.\n\nThen, we pass this through f.

The |sin(2\u03c0x)| is a sine wave that's always non-negative, with peaks at 1 and 0 at each integer.
