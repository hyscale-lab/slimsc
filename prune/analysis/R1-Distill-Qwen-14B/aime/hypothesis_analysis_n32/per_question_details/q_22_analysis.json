Now, let's compute the coordinates of Z.\n\nUsing the distance formula, let me assume X is at (0, 0), Y is at (200, 0). Then, point Z is at (p, q).

Now, point C is somewhere such that AC=300 and BC=240.\n\nUsing the distance formula, coordinates of C (x, y) must satisfy:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 300\u00b2 = 90000,\n\nand (x - 200)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 240\u00b2 = 57600.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\n(x - 200)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 57600 - 90000,\n\nExpanding (x - 200)\u00b2: x\u00b2 - 400x + 40000.\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2 -400x +40000 + y\u00b2 -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = -32400,\n\nSimplify:\n\n-400x + 40000 = -32400,\n\n-400x = -72400,\n\nx = (-72400)/(-400) = 72400 / 400.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 100: 724 / 4 = 181.\n\nSo x = 181.\n\nThen, substitute back into x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 90000:\n\n181\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 90000.\n\nCalculate 181\u00b2: 180\u00b2=32400, 181\u00b2=32400 + 2*180 +1 = 32400 + 360 +1= 32761.\n\nSo,\n\n32761 + y\u00b2 = 90000,\n\ny\u00b2 = 90000 - 32761 = 57239.\n\nSo y = sqrt(57239). Let me compute that.\n\nWell, 239\u00b2 = 57121, since 240\u00b2=57600. So sqrt(57239) is between 239 and 240.\n\nCompute 239\u00b2 = 57121, 57239 -57121=118.\n\nSo y = sqrt(57239) \u2248 239 + 118/(2*239) \u2248 239 + 0.245\u2248239.245. But exact value might not be necessary.\n\nSo point C is at (181, sqrt(57239)).\n\nNow, the triangle T has coordinates A(0,0), B(200, 0), C(181, sqrt(57239)).\n\nNow, the hexagon ABCDEF is a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel.\n\nSo, sides AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA are all equal in length, and AB || DE, BC || EF, CD || FA.\n\nMoreover, the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, 300.",
          "text2": "Wait, if AB=200, BC=240, and AC=300, then by the Law of Cosines, I can find angles. But maybe it's easier to place it on a coordinate system.\n\nLet me place point A at (0,0), point B at (200,0). Then point C is somewhere in the plane. The distance from A to C is 300, and from B to C is 240.\n\nSo, coordinates of C satisfy:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 300^2,\n\nand (x-200)^2 + y^2 = 240^2.\n\nSubtracting the two equations:\n\n(x^2 + y^2) - [(x-200)^2 + y^2] = 300^2 - 240^2\n\nExpand:\n\nx^2 - (x^2 - 400x + 40000) = 90000 - 57600\n\nSimplify:\n\n400x - 40000 = 32400\n\n400x = 32400 + 40000 = 72400\n\nx = 72400 / 400 = 181.\n\nSo, x = 181. Then, substitute back to find y.\n\nFrom x^2 + y^2 = 300^2,\n\n181^2 + y^2 = 90000.\n\n181^2: 180^2=32400, 181^2=32400 + 2*180 +1=32400+360+1=32761.\n\nSo, y^2 = 90000 - 32761 = 57239.\n\nSo, y = sqrt(57239). Let me compute that approximately. 239^2=57121, 240^2=57600. So, sqrt(57239) \u2248 239.247.\n\nSo, point C is at (181, ~239.247).\n\nOkay, now the triangle T has vertices at A(0,0), B(200,0), and C(181, 239.247).\n\nNow, the hexagon is inscribed within triangle T, with its sides AB, CD, EF lying along lines that when extended form the sides of T.",

Let's write parametric equations.\n\nThe vector from H to I is (-19, 239.25). The length of HI is 240.\n\nSo, any point on HI can be written as H + t*(vector HI), where t ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nSo,\n\nx = 200 -19t\ny = 0 + 239.25t\n\nSimilarly, points B and D are two points on HI, so we can write:\n\nFor point B: t = t1\nx1 = 200 -19t1\ny1 = 239.25t1\n\nFor point D: t = t2\nx2 = 200 -19t2\ny2 = 239.25t2\n\nSimilarly, points C and E are on IG.\n\nPoint I is (181,239.25), point G is (0,0). The vector from I to G is (-181, -239.25). Length of IG is 300.\n\nParametrize IG as I + u*(vector IG), where u ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nSo,\n\nx = 181 -181u\ny = 239.25 -239.25u\n\nPoints C and E are on IG, so:\n\nFor point C: u = u1\nx3 = 181 -181u1\ny3 = 239.25 -239.25u1\n\nFor point E: u = u2\nx4 = 181 -181u2\ny4 = 239.25 -239.25u2\n\nSimilarly, points A and F are on GH: A is (a,0), F is (f,0).\n\nNow, we have the following equations from the vectors:\n\n1. From AB and DE:\n\nx1 - a = x4 - x2\ny1 = y4 - y2\n\n2. From BC and EF:\n\nx3 - x1 = f - x4\ny3 - y1 = - y4\n\n3.

So, each side of T has two vertices of the hexagon lying on it.\n\nSo, let's assign:\n\n- On GH: A and F\n- On HI: B and D\n- On IG: C and E\n\nThus, the hexagon is A-B-C-D-E-F-A, with A and F on GH, B and D on HI, C and E on IG.\n\nSince the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA.\n\nSo, let's define the points:\n\n- A on GH: A = (a, 0)\n- F on GH: F = (f, 0)\n- B on HI: B = (x1, y1)\n- D on HI: D = (x2, y2)\n- C on IG: C = (x3, y3)\n- E on IG: E = (x4, y4)\n\nNow, the sides:\n\nAB: from A to B\nBC: from B to C\nCD: from C to D\nDE: from D to E\nEF: from E to F\nFA: from F to A\n\nAll these sides have length 's', and the opposite sides are parallel:\n\nAB || DE\nBC || EF\nCD || FA\n\nSo, the vector AB must be equal to the vector DE.\n\nSimilarly, vector BC equals vector EF, and vector CD equals vector FA.\n\nSo, let's write the vectors:\n\nVector AB = (x1 - a, y1 - 0) = (x1 - a, y1)\nVector DE = (x4 - x2, y4 - y2)\n\nSince AB || DE, their vectors must be equal. So,\n\nx1 - a = x4 - x2\ny1 = y4 - y2\n\nSimilarly, for vectors BC and EF:\n\nVector BC = (x3 - x1, y3 - y1)\nVector EF = (f - x4, 0 - y4)\n\nSo,\n\nx3 - x1 = f - x4\ny3 - y1 = - y4\n\nAnd for vectors CD and FA:\n\nVector CD = (x2 - x3, y2 - y3)\nVector FA = (a - f, 0 - 0) = (a - f, 0)\n\nSo,\n\nx2 - x3 = a - f\ny2 - y3 = 0\n\nSo, y2 = y3.\n\nNow, this is getting quite involved, but let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, points on HI: points B and D.\n\nParametrize HI: from H(200,0) to I(181,239.25). Let's write parametric equations.\n\nThe vector from H to I is (-19, 239.25). The length of HI is 240.\n\nSo, any point on HI can be written as H + t*(vector HI), where t ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nSo,\n\nx = 200 -19t\ny = 0 + 239.25t\n\nSimilarly, points B and D are two points on HI, so we can write:\n\nFor point B: t = t1\nx1 = 200 -19t1\ny1 = 239.25t1\n\nFor point D: t = t2\nx2 = 200 -19t2\ny2 = 239.25t2\n\nSimilarly, points C and E are on IG.\n\nPoint I is (181,239.25), point G is (0,0). The vector from I to G is (-181, -239.25). Length of IG is 300.\n\nParametrize IG as I + u*(vector IG), where u ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nSo,\n\nx = 181 -181u\ny = 239.25 -239.25u\n\nPoints C and E are on IG, so:\n\nFor point C: u = u1\nx3 = 181 -181u1\ny3 = 239.25 -239.25u1\n\nFor point E: u = u2\nx4 = 181 -181u2\ny4 = 239.25 -239.25u2\n\nSimilarly, points A and F are on GH: A is (a,0), F is (f,0).\n\nNow, we have the following equations from the vectors:\n\n1. From AB and DE:\n\nx1 - a = x4 - x2\ny1 = y4 - y2\n\n2. From BC and EF:\n\nx3 - x1 = f - x4\ny3 - y1 = - y4\n\n3. From CD and FA:\n\nx2 - x3 = a - f\ny2 = y3\n\nAdditionally, the lengths of all sides are 's':\n\nAB: distance from A to B = s\nBC: distance from B to C = s\nCD: distance from C to D = s\nDE: distance from D to E = s\nEF: distance from E to F = s\nFA: distance from F to A = s\n\nSo, let's write down the distance equations.\n\nAB:\n\nsqrt( (x1 - a)^2 + y1^2 ) = s\n\nBC:\n\nsqrt( (x3 - x1)^2 + (y3 - y1)^2 ) = s\n\nCD:\n\nsqrt( (x2 - x3)^2 + (y2 - y3)^2 ) = s\n\nDE:\n\nsqrt( (x4 - x2)^2 + (y4 - y2)^2 ) = s\n\nEF:\n\nsqrt( (f - x4)^2 + (0 - y4)^2 ) = s\n\nFA:\n\nsqrt( (a - f)^2 + 0^2 ) = |a - f| = s\n\nSo, |a - f| = s. Therefore, a - f = s or f - a = s. But since A and F are both on GH from G(0,0) to H(200,0), and the hexagon is convex, the order must be A---F on GH, so a > f. So, a - f = s.\n\nSo, equation FA: a - f = s.\n\nSo, we have a - f = s.\n\nNow, let's proceed step by step.\n\nFrom equation 3: x2 - x3 = a - f = s\n\nFrom equation 3: y2 = y3.\n\nFrom equation 1: x1 - a = x4 - x2 => x1 = x4 - x2 + a\n\nFrom equation 1: y1 = y4 - y2 = y4 - y3\n\nFrom equation 2: x3 - x1 = f - x4\n\nFrom equation 2: y3 - y1 = -y4 => y3 = y1 - y4\n\nBut from equation 3: y2 = y3 => y3 = y2\n\nFrom equation 1: y1 = y4 - y2\n\nSo, combining these:\n\ny3 = y2 = y1 + y4",

So, b\u00b2 = 90000 - 32761 = 57239.\n\nSo b = sqrt(57239) \u2248 239.246, but I'll keep it exact for now.\n\nSo, point Z is at (181, sqrt(57239)).\n\nNow, the hexagon ABCDEF is inside this triangle, with sides AB, CD, EF extended forming the triangle XYZ.\n\nSince the hexagon is convex, equilateral, and opposite sides are parallel, the points A, B, C, D, E, F must lie on the sides of triangle XYZ.",

Let's write parametric equations.\n\nThe vector from H to I is (-19, 239.25). The length of HI is 240.\n\nSo, any point on HI can be written as H + t*(vector HI), where t ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nSo,\n\nx = 200 -19t\ny = 0 + 239.25t\n\nSimilarly, points B and D are two points on HI, so we can write:\n\nFor point B: t = t1\nx1 = 200 -19t1\ny1 = 239.25t1\n\nFor point D: t = t2\nx2 = 200 -19t2\ny2 = 239.25t2\n\nSimilarly, points C and E are on IG.\n\nPoint I is (181,239.25), point G is (0,0). The vector from I to G is (-181, -239.25). Length of IG is 300.\n\nParametrize IG as I + u*(vector IG), where u ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nSo,\n\nx = 181 -181u\ny = 239.25 -239.25u\n\nPoints C and E are on IG, so:\n\nFor point C: u = u1\nx3 = 181 -181u1\ny3 = 239.25 -239.25u1\n\nFor point E: u = u2\nx4 = 181 -181u2\ny4 = 239.25 -239.25u2\n\nSimilarly, points A and F are on GH: A is (a,0), F is (f,0).\n\nNow, we have the following equations from the vectors:\n\n1. From AB and DE:\n\nx1 - a = x4 - x2\ny1 = y4 - y2\n\n2. From BC and EF:\n\nx3 - x1 = f - x4\ny3 - y1 = - y4\n\n3. From CD and FA:\n\nx2 - x3 = a - f\ny2 = y3\n\nAdditionally, the lengths of all sides are 's':\n\nAB: distance from A to B = s\nBC: distance from B to C = s\nCD: distance from C to D = s\nDE: distance from D to E = s\nEF: distance from E to F = s\nFA: distance from F to A = s\n\nSo, let's write down the distance equations.\n\nAB:\n\nsqrt( (x1 - a)^2 + y1^2 ) = s\n\nBC:\n\nsqrt( (x3 - x1)^2 + (y3 - y1)^2 ) = s\n\nCD:\n\nsqrt( (x2 - x3)^2 + (y2 - y3)^2 ) = s\n\nDE:\n\nsqrt( (x4 - x2)^2 + (y4 - y2)^2 ) = s\n\nEF:\n\nsqrt( (f - x4)^2 + (0 - y4)^2 ) = s\n\nFA:\n\nsqrt( (a - f)^2 + 0^2 ) = |a - f| = s\n\nSo, |a - f| = s.

From AB and DE:\n\nx1 - a = x4 - x2\ny1 = y4 - y2\n\n2. From BC and EF:\n\nx3 - x1 = f - x4\ny3 - y1 = - y4\n\n3. From CD and FA:\n\nx2 - x3 = a - f\ny2 = y3\n\nAdditionally, the lengths of all sides are 's':\n\nAB: distance from A to B = s\nBC: distance from B to C = s\nCD: distance from C to D = s\nDE: distance from D to E = s\nEF: distance from E to F = s\nFA: distance from F to A = s\n\nSo, let's write down the distance equations.\n\nAB:\n\nsqrt( (x1 - a)^2 + y1^2 ) = s\n\nBC:\n\nsqrt( (x3 - x1)^2 + (y3 - y1)^2 ) = s\n\nCD:\n\nsqrt( (x2 - x3)^2 + (y2 - y3)^2 ) = s\n\nDE:\n\nsqrt( (x4 - x2)^2 + (y4 - y2)^2 ) = s\n\nEF:\n\nsqrt( (f - x4)^2 + (0 - y4)^2 ) = s\n\nFA:\n\nsqrt( (a - f)^2 + 0^2 ) = |a - f| = s\n\nSo, |a - f| = s. Therefore, a - f = s or f - a = s. But since A and F are both on GH from G(0,0) to H(200,0), and the hexagon is convex, the order must be A---F on GH, so a > f. So, a - f = s.\n\nSo, equation FA: a - f = s.\n\nSo, we have a - f = s.\n\nNow, let's proceed step by step.\n\nFrom equation 3: x2 - x3 = a - f = s\n\nFrom equation 3: y2 = y3.\n\nFrom equation 1: x1 - a = x4 - x2 => x1 = x4 - x2 + a\n\nFrom equation 1: y1 = y4 - y2 = y4 - y3\n\nFrom equation 2: x3 - x1 = f - x4\n\nFrom equation 2: y3 - y1 = -y4 => y3 = y1 - y4\n\nBut from equation 3: y2 = y3 => y3 = y2\n\nFrom equation 1: y1 = y4 - y2\n\nSo, combining these:\n\ny3 = y2 = y1 + y4",

Then, from p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 90000:\n\n181\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 90000 \u2192 32761 + q\u00b2 = 90000 \u2192 q\u00b2 = 57239 \u2192 q \u2248 sqrt(57239) \u2248 239.247.\n\nSo, point Z is at (181, ~239.247).\n\nNow, the hexagon is inside triangle XYZ, with sides AB, CD, EF each of length 's', and their extensions forming XYZ. The hexagon is convex, so all its interior angles are less than 180 degrees.\n\nLet me denote the points A, B on XY; C, D on YZ; and E, F on ZX.\n\nSince AB is a side of the hexagon, and it's on XY, which is from (0,0) to (200,0). Let me denote A at (a, 0) and B at (a + s, 0). Similarly, CD is on YZ. Let me parameterize YZ.",
          "text2": "Wait, this might get complicated, but let's try.\n\nSo, point X is at (0,0), Y is at (200, 0). Now, point Z is somewhere in the plane such that XZ is 300 and YZ is 240.\n\nUsing the distance formula, the coordinates of Z must satisfy:\n\nDistance from X (0,0) to Z (a,b) is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 300 \u2192 a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 90000.\n\nDistance from Y (200,0) to Z (a,b) is sqrt( (a-200)^2 + b\u00b2 ) = 240 \u2192 (a-200)^2 + b\u00b2 = 57600.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\n(a-200)^2 + b\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 57600 - 90000\n\nExpanding (a-200)^2: a\u00b2 - 400a + 40000.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 -400a +40000 + b\u00b2 - a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = -32400\n\nSimplify: -400a +40000 = -32400\n\n-400a = -72400 \u2192 a = (-72400)/(-400) = 181.\n\nSo a = 181. Then, from a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 90000:\n\n181\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 90000\n\n181\u00b2 is 32761. So, b\u00b2 = 90000 - 32761 = 57239.\n\nSo b = sqrt(57239) \u2248 239.246, but I'll keep it exact for now.\n\nSo, point Z is at (181, sqrt(57239)).\n\nNow, the hexagon ABCDEF is inside this triangle, with sides AB, CD, EF extended forming the triangle XYZ.\n\nSince the hexagon is convex, equilateral, and opposite sides are parallel, the points A, B, C, D, E, F must lie on the sides of triangle XYZ.",

Then, h\u00b2 = 57600 - (19)^2 = 57600 - 361 = 57239.\n\nSo, h = sqrt(57239) \u2248 239.245. Hmm, okay, so the coordinates are:\n\nA: (0, 0)\nB: (200, 0)\nC: (19, 239.245)\n\nNow, the hexagon is inscribed such that sides AB, CD, EF are extended to form triangle T.",

Let's write parametric equations.\n\nThe vector from H to I is (-19, 239.25). The length of HI is 240.\n\nSo, any point on HI can be written as H + t*(vector HI), where t ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nSo,\n\nx = 200 -19t\ny = 0 + 239.25t\n\nSimilarly, points B and D are two points on HI, so we can write:\n\nFor point B: t = t1\nx1 = 200 -19t1\ny1 = 239.25t1\n\nFor point D: t = t2\nx2 = 200 -19t2\ny2 = 239.25t2\n\nSimilarly, points C and E are on IG.\n\nPoint I is (181,239.25), point G is (0,0). The vector from I to G is (-181, -239.25). Length of IG is 300.\n\nParametrize IG as I + u*(vector IG), where u ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nSo,\n\nx = 181 -181u\ny = 239.25 -239.25u\n\nPoints C and E are on IG, so:\n\nFor point C: u = u1\nx3 = 181 -181u1\ny3 = 239.25 -239.25u1\n\nFor point E: u = u2\nx4 = 181 -181u2\ny4 = 239.25 -239.25u2\n\nSimilarly, points A and F are on GH: A is (a,0), F is (f,0).\n\nNow, we have the following equations from the vectors:\n\n1. From AB and DE:\n\nx1 - a = x4 - x2\ny1 = y4 - y2\n\n2. From BC and EF:\n\nx3 - x1 = f - x4\ny3 - y1 = - y4\n\n3. From CD and FA:\n\nx2 - x3 = a - f\ny2 = y3\n\nAdditionally, the lengths of all sides are 's':\n\nAB: distance from A to B = s\nBC: distance from B to C = s\nCD: distance from C to D = s\nDE: distance from D to E = s\nEF: distance from E to F = s\nFA: distance from F to A = s\n\nSo, let's write down the distance equations.\n\nAB:\n\nsqrt( (x1 - a)^2 + y1^2 ) = s\n\nBC:\n\nsqrt( (x3 - x1)^2 + (y3 - y1)^2 ) = s\n\nCD:\n\nsqrt( (x2 - x3)^2 + (y2 - y3)^2 ) = s\n\nDE:\n\nsqrt( (x4 - x2)^2 + (y4 - y2)^2 ) = s\n\nEF:\n\nsqrt( (f - x4)^2 + (0 - y4)^2 ) = s\n\nFA:\n\nsqrt( (a - f)^2 + 0^2 ) = |a - f| = s\n\nSo, |a - f| = s. Therefore, a - f = s or f - a = s. But since A and F are both on GH from G(0,0) to H(200,0), and the hexagon is convex, the order must be A---F on GH, so a > f. So, a - f = s.\n\nSo, equation FA: a - f = s.\n\nSo, we have a - f = s.\n\nNow, let's proceed step by step.\n\nFrom equation 3: x2 - x3 = a - f = s\n\nFrom equation 3: y2 = y3.\n\nFrom equation 1: x1 - a = x4 - x2 => x1 = x4 - x2 + a\n\nFrom equation 1: y1 = y4 - y2 = y4 - y3\n\nFrom equation 2: x3 - x1 = f - x4\n\nFrom equation 2: y3 - y1 = -y4 => y3 = y1 - y4\n\nBut from equation 3: y2 = y3 => y3 = y2\n\nFrom equation 1: y1 = y4 - y2\n\nSo, combining these:\n\ny3 = y2 = y1 + y4",

So 40000 + 57600 = 97600. 300\u00b2 is 90000. So no, not a right triangle.\n\nHmm, so triangle T is a scalene triangle with sides 200, 240, 300.\n\nI need to assign coordinates to this triangle. Let me place point A at (0, 0), point B at (200, 0). Point C is somewhere in the plane. The distance from A to C is 240, and from B to C is 300.\n\nSo, let's compute the coordinates of point C.\n\nLet me denote point C as (x, y). Then, the distance from A(0,0) to C(x,y) is 240, so:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 240\u00b2 = 57600.\n\nThe distance from B(200, 0) to C(x,y) is 300:\n\n(x - 200)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 300\u00b2 = 90000.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\n(x - 200)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 90000 - 57600.\n\nExpanding (x - 200)^2: x\u00b2 - 400x + 40000.\n\nSo, subtract x\u00b2 + y\u00b2: (x\u00b2 -400x +40000 + y\u00b2) - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = -400x + 40000.\n\nSet equal to 32400:\n\n-400x + 40000 = 32400.\n\nSo, -400x = 32400 - 40000 = -7600.\n\nTherefore, x = (-7600)/(-400) = 7600 / 400 = 19.\n\nSo, x = 19. Then, plug back into x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 57600:\n\n19\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 57600.\n\n19\u00b2 is 361, so y\u00b2 = 57600 - 361 = 57239.\n\nSo, y = sqrt(57239) \u2248 239.246.\n\nSo, point C is approximately at (19, 239.246).

Let me place vertex A at (0, 0), vertex B at (200, 0), and vertex C somewhere in the plane.\n\nNow, to find the coordinates of C, knowing that AC = 240 and BC = 300.\n\nSo, the coordinates of C satisfy:\n\nDistance from A (0,0) to C (x,y): sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 240 => x^2 + y^2 = 240^2.\n\nDistance from B (200, 0) to C (x,y): sqrt((x - 200)^2 + y^2) = 300 => (x - 200)^2 + y^2 = 300^2.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\n(x - 200)^2 + y^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = 300^2 - 240^2.\n\nExpanding (x - 200)^2: x^2 - 400x + 40000.\n\nSo, x^2 - 400x + 40000 + y^2 - x^2 - y^2 = 90000 - 57600.\n\nSimplify: -400x + 40000 = 32400.\n\nThen, -400x = 32400 - 40000 = -7600.\n\nSo, x = (-7600)/(-400) = 7600 / 400 = 19.\n\nSo, x = 19.
