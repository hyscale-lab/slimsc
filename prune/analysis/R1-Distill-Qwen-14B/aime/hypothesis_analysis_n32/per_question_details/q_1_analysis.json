Convert -2 to -16/8, so -16/8 -9/8 = -25/8.\n\nSo, x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2 = 2^(-25/8)\n\nTaking log base 2:\n\nlog\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8\n\nThe absolute value of this is | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo, the value is 25/8. Since 25 and 8 are coprime (no common factors except 1), m=25 and n=8. Therefore, m +n = 33.",

Correct.\n\nOkay, so the values seem consistent.\n\nNow, the problem asks for |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|.\n\nSo first, let's compute x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2.\n\nExpress each variable as 2 raised to some exponent:\n\nx\u2074 = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6).\n\ny\u00b3 = (2^(-3/8))^3 =2^(-9/8).\n\nz\u00b2 = (2^(-5/12))^2=2^(-10/12)=2^(-5/6).\n\nMultiply them together:\n\nx\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6).\n\nAdd exponents:\n\n-7/6 + (-9/8) + (-5/6) = sum all.\n\nConvert all to 24ths:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24, -9/8 = -27/24, -5/6 = -20/24.\n\nSum: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24.\n\nSimplify: -75/24 = -25/8.\n\nSo x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-25/8).\n\nSo log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = log\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.\n\nBut the question asks for the absolute value, so | -25/8 | =25/8.\n\nSo the value is 25/8, which is already in lowest terms because 25 and 8 are coprime (factors of 25 are 1,5,25; 8 is 2^3. No common factors except 1). So m =25, n=8, m +n=33.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything.\n\n1. Converted each logarithmic equation to exponential form.\n2. Multiplied all three equations together to find x y z = 2^(-13/12).\n3. Expressed each variable in terms of others using substitution, leading to expressions for z, y, and x in terms of powers of 2.\n4. Verified the solutions by plugging back into the original equations.\n5. Calculated x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 by expressing each variable as a power of 2, adding the exponents, and then taking log base 2 of the result.\n6. Took absolute value and expressed as a fraction, then summed m and n.\n\nYes, that seems solid. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but it's always good to double-check exponents.",

Since y is positive, we take the positive root.\n\nSo, y = 2^(-3/8). Let's note this as equation (6).\n\nNow, from equation (5), x = 2^(1/12) * y. Substituting equation (6):\n\nx = 2^(1/12) * 2^(-3/8) = 2^(1/12 - 3/8)\n\nConvert to common denominators: 1/12 is 2/24, 3/8 is 9/24.\n\nSo, 2/24 -9/24 = -7/24. Therefore,\n\nx = 2^(-7/24). Equation (7).\n\nSo now, I have expressions for x, y, z.\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\ny = 2^(-3/8)\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nNow, I need to compute |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|. Let's compute the exponent first.\n\nFirst, calculate each term:\n\nx\u2074 = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6)\ny\u00b3 = (2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8)\nz\u00b2 = (2^(-5/12))^2 = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nNow, multiply these together:\n\nx\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6)\n\nAdding exponents:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, -7/6 -5/6 = (-7 -5)/6 = -12/6 = -2.\n\nThen, -2 -9/8. Convert -2 to -16/8, so -16/8 -9/8 = -25/8.\n\nSo, x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2 = 2^(-25/8)\n\nTaking log base 2:\n\nlog\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8\n\nThe absolute value of this is | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo, the value is 25/8. Since 25 and 8 are coprime (no common factors except 1), m=25 and n=8. Therefore, m +n = 33.",

Since y is positive, we take the positive root.\n\nSo, y = 2^(-3/8). Let's note this as equation (6).\n\nNow, from equation (5), x = 2^(1/12) * y. Substituting equation (6):\n\nx = 2^(1/12) * 2^(-3/8) = 2^(1/12 - 3/8)\n\nConvert to common denominators: 1/12 is 2/24, 3/8 is 9/24.\n\nSo, 2/24 -9/24 = -7/24. Therefore,\n\nx = 2^(-7/24). Equation (7).\n\nSo now, I have expressions for x, y, z.\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\ny = 2^(-3/8)\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nNow, I need to compute |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|. Let's compute the exponent first.\n\nFirst, calculate each term:\n\nx\u2074 = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6)\ny\u00b3 = (2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8)\nz\u00b2 = (2^(-5/12))^2 = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nNow, multiply these together:\n\nx\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6)\n\nAdding exponents:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, -7/6 -5/6 = (-7 -5)/6 = -12/6 = -2.\n\nThen, -2 -9/8. Convert -2 to -16/8, so -16/8 -9/8 = -25/8.\n\nSo, x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2 = 2^(-25/8)\n\nTaking log base 2:\n\nlog\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8\n\nThe absolute value of this is | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo, the value is 25/8. Since 25 and 8 are coprime (no common factors except 1), m=25 and n=8. Therefore, m +n = 33.",

So,\n\ny = 2^(5/6) * y * z^2\n\nNow, divide both sides by y (since y is positive, we can do that):\n\n1 = 2^(5/6) * z^2\n\nSo, z^2 = 1 / 2^(5/6)\n\nWhich is the same as z^2 = 2^(-5/6)\n\nSo, taking square roots (since z is positive), z = 2^(-5/12)",

So 2/24 -9/24 = -7/24.\n\nSo x = 2^(-7/24).\n\nSo now, we have x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-3/8), z = 2^(-5/12).\n\nLet me double-check these values in the original equations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst equation: log\u2082(x/(y z)).\n\nCompute x/(y z):\n\nx is 2^(-7/24), y is 2^(-3/8), z is 2^(-5/12).\n\nSo y z = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-3/8 -5/12).\n\nConvert to common denominator, which is 24.\n\n-3/8 = -9/24, -5/12 = -10/24. So total is -19/24.\n\nSo y z = 2^(-19/24).\n\nx/(y z) = 2^(-7/24) / 2^(-19/24) = 2^(-7/24 +19/24) = 2^(12/24) = 2^(1/2).\n\nSo log\u2082(2^(1/2)) is 1/2. Correct for equation 1.\n\nEquation 2: log\u2082(y/(x z)).\n\nCompute y/(x z):\n\ny is 2^(-3/8), x z = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-7/24 -10/24) = 2^(-17/24).\n\ny/(x z) = 2^(-3/8) / 2^(-17/24) = 2^(-3/8 +17/24).\n\nConvert to 24ths: -3/8 = -9/24, so -9/24 +17/24 =8/24=1/3.\n\nSo 2^(1/3), log\u2082 is 1/3. Correct.\n\nEquation 3: log\u2082(z/(x y)).\n\nz is 2^(-5/12), x y = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-7/24 -9/24)=2^(-16/24)=2^(-2/3).\n\nSo z/(x y) = 2^(-5/12)/2^(-2/3) = 2^(-5/12 +8/12)=2^(3/12)=2^(1/4).\n\nLog\u2082 is 1/4. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the values seem consistent.\n\nNow, the problem asks for |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|.\n\nSo first, let's compute x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2.\n\nExpress each variable as 2 raised to some exponent:\n\nx\u2074 = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6).\n\ny\u00b3 = (2^(-3/8))^3 =2^(-9/8).\n\nz\u00b2 = (2^(-5/12))^2=2^(-10/12)=2^(-5/6).\n\nMultiply them together:\n\nx\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6).\n\nAdd exponents:\n\n-7/6 + (-9/8) + (-5/6) = sum all.\n\nConvert all to 24ths:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24, -9/8 = -27/24, -5/6 = -20/24.\n\nSum: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24.\n\nSimplify: -75/24 = -25/8.\n\nSo x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-25/8).\n\nSo log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = log\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.\n\nBut the question asks for the absolute value, so | -25/8 | =25/8.\n\nSo the value is 25/8, which is already in lowest terms because 25 and 8 are coprime (factors of 25 are 1,5,25; 8 is 2^3. No common factors except 1). So m =25, n=8, m +n=33.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything.\n\n1. Converted each logarithmic equation to exponential form.\n2. Multiplied all three equations together to find x y z = 2^(-13/12).\n3. Expressed each variable in terms of others using substitution, leading to expressions for z, y, and x in terms of powers of 2.\n4. Verified the solutions by plugging back into the original equations.\n5. Calculated x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 by expressing each variable as a power of 2, adding the exponents, and then taking log base 2 of the result.\n6. Took absolute value and expressed as a fraction, then summed m and n.\n\nYes, that seems solid. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but it's always good to double-check exponents.",
