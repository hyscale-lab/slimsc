So, if from the current position n, all possible next moves (n-1 and n-4, assuming they are \u22650) are winning for the opponent, then n is a losing position for the current player.\n\nSo, let's try to model this step by step.\n\nLet me create an array or a list where each index represents n, and the value is True if it's a winning position, False otherwise.\n\nWe can start by initializing an array up to, say, 2024, and set each position based on the previous ones.\n\nBase case:\nn=0: losing position (False)\nn=1: can take 1, so it's a winning position (True)\nn=2: from 2, you can take 1 to leave 1, which is a winning position for the opponent. So, if you take 1, opponent can win. Are there any other moves? You can also take 4, but 2-4 = -2, which isn't allowed. So, only move is to 1.
