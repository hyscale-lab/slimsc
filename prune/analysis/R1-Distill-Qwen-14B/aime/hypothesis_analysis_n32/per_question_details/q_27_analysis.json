So, when the torus is inside the sphere, it's smaller, but in our case, the sphere is radius 11, and the torus's maximum distance is 9, so it's entirely inside.\n\nBut how can it rest on the inside? That suggests that the sphere is inside the torus, but that's only possible if the sphere's radius is smaller than the torus's minimum distance from the origin. But the sphere's radius is 11, which is larger than the torus's maximum distance of 9.",

So, there exists a scalar \u03bb such that:\n\n(2x(s -6)/s, 2y(s -6)/s, 2z) = \u03bb (2x, 2y, 2z )\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nx(s -6)/s, y(s -6)/s, z = \u03bb (x, y, z )\n\nSo, component-wise:\n\nx(s -6)/s = \u03bb x\n\ny(s -6)/s = \u03bb y\n\nz = \u03bb z\n\nNow, let's analyze these equations.\n\nFirst, from the z-component:\n\nz = \u03bb z.\n\nSo, either z = 0 or \u03bb = 1.\n\nCase 1: z = 0.\n\nIf z = 0, then from the sphere equation, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 121.\n\nFrom the torus equation, (\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6)^2 = 9.\n\nSo, (\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6)^2 = 9.\n\nTake square roots: \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6 = \u00b13.\n\nSo, \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 6 \u00b13.\n\nThus, \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 9 or \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 3.\n\nBut from the sphere equation, \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 11, which is not 9 or 3. So, this leads to a contradiction. Therefore, there is no solution when z = 0.\n\nCase 2: \u03bb = 1.\n\nSo, from the first two equations:\n\nx(s -6)/s = x\n\ny(s -6)/s = y\n\nWhere s = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nAssuming x \u2260 0 and y \u2260 0 (if either x or y is zero, we can check that case separately).\n\nSo, from x(s -6)/s = x, since x \u2260 0, we can divide both sides by x:\n\n(s -6)/s = 1\n\nMultiply both sides by s:\n\ns -6 = s\n\nWhich implies -6 = 0, which is impossible. Therefore, the only possibility is x = 0 and y = 0. But if x = 0 and y = 0, then from the sphere equation, z^2 = 121, so z = \u00b111. But in that case, s = \u221a(0 + 0) = 0, and the torus equation would have (0 -6)^2 + z^2 = 9 => 36 + z^2 = 9 => z^2 = -27, which is impossible. So, no solution in this case.\n\nTherefore, the only possible case is when \u03bb = 1, but that led to a contradiction unless x = y = 0, which isn't possible. So, perhaps I made a mistake in reasoning.",

However, the sphere is fixed at the origin. So, when the torus is shifted, the points of tangency would change.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nLet me denote the torus as being shifted along the z-axis by a distance h. So, the equation of the torus becomes:\n\n(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + (z - h)^2 = 9.\n\nNow, the sphere is at the origin with equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121.\n\nWe need to find h such that the torus and sphere are tangent along a circle. The points of tangency must satisfy both equations and have the same tangent plane.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps we can find the condition for tangency.\n\nLet me consider a point (x, y, z) on both the torus and the sphere, and the gradients (normals) are scalar multiples.\n\nThe normal to the sphere is (x, y, z).\n\nThe normal to the torus is:\n\nFrom F(x, y, z) = (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + (z - h)^2 - 9 = 0.\n\nCompute the partial derivatives:\n\ndF/dx = 2 (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (x / sqrt(x^2 + y^2))\ndF/dy = 2 (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (y / sqrt(x^2 + y^2))\ndF/dz = 2 (z - h)\n\nSo, the gradient is proportional to:\n\n[ (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (x / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)),  \n  (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (y / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)),  \n  (z - h) ]\n\nSetting this proportional to the sphere's normal (x, y, z):\n\n[ (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (x / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)),  \n  (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (y / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)),  \n  (z - h) ]  \n= \u03bb [x, y, z]\n\nSo, component-wise:\n\n1. (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (x / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) = \u03bb x\n2. (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (y / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) = \u03bb y\n3. (z - h) = \u03bb z\n\nFrom equation 3: \u03bb = (z - h)/z, provided z \u2260 0.\n\nFrom equations 1 and 2, let me consider that x and y are not zero (since if x=0 and y=0, the point would be (0,0,z), but that point isn't on the torus as we saw earlier). So, dividing both sides by x and y respectively:\n\n1. (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) / sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = \u03bb\n2.

Since r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2), this becomes:\n\nr^2 + z^2 = 121.\n\nFrom the torus: (r - 6)^2 + (z - h)^2 = 9.\n\nWe also have r = (6 z)/h.\n\nLet me substitute r = (6 z)/h into the sphere's equation:\n\n[(6 z)/h]^2 + z^2 = 121\n(36 z^2)/h^2 + z^2 = 121\nz^2 (36/h^2 + 1) = 121\nz^2 = 121 / (36/h^2 + 1)\n= 121 h^2 / (36 + h^2)\n\nSimilarly, substitute r = (6 z)/h into the torus's equation:\n\n(r - 6)^2 + (z - h)^2 = 9\n( (6 z / h ) - 6 )^2 + (z - h)^2 = 9\n[6(z/h - 1)]^2 + (z - h)^2 = 9\n36 (z/h - 1)^2 + (z - h)^2 = 9\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n36 ( (z - h)/h )^2 + (z - h)^2 = 9\n36 (z - h)^2 / h^2 + (z - h)^2 = 9\nFactor out (z - h)^2:\n\n(z - h)^2 (36 / h^2 + 1) = 9\n\nSo,\n\n(z - h)^2 = 9 / (36 / h^2 + 1)\n= 9 h^2 / (36 + h^2)\n\nTherefore,\n\nz - h = \u00b1 3 h / sqrt(36 + h^2)\n\nThus,\n\nz = h \u00b1 (3 h) / sqrt(36 + h^2)\n\nBut since the torus is placed either inside or outside the sphere, we can consider the appropriate sign.\n\nCase 1: Torus inside the sphere (rests on the inside).

Since the torus is a surface, and the sphere is another, the points of tangency must satisfy both equations, and their normals must be the same at those points.\n\nLet me compute the normals for both surfaces. For the sphere, the gradient (which gives the normal vector) at any point (x, y, z) is (2x, 2y, 2z). For the torus, which is given by (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - 6)^2 + z\u00b2 = 9, the gradient would be ( (2(sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - 6) * (x / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)) ), (2(sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - 6) * (y / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)) ), 2z ).\n\nAt the points of tangency, the normals are scalar multiples of each other.

(sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6) * (y / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)) = \u03bb y\n3. z = \u03bb z\n\nFrom equation 3, either z = 0 or \u03bb = 1.\n\nIf z = 0, then from the sphere equation, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 121.

Then, the equation of the torus would be (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + (z - d)^2 = 9.\n\nThen, the sphere is at the origin, x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121.\n\nNow, when the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the distance between their centers is d, and we can model the points of tangency.\n\nSimilarly, when the torus is outside, it's placed such that it's externally tangent to the sphere.\n\nThis seems promising. Let me try this approach.\n\nSo, the sphere is at the origin, and the torus's generating circle is centered at (0, 0, d).

I should have considered that the center of the generating circle is at a distance d from the sphere's center along the axis. So, in this case, the sphere is at (0,0,0), and the generating circle is at (d, 0, 0).

Let me compute the normals.\n\nFor the sphere, the gradient (normal vector) at point (x,y,z) is (2x, 2y, 2z).\n\nFor the torus, the gradient is a bit more involved.

Now, from the x-component:\n\n2(\u03c1 -6) * (x - d)/\u03c1 = \u03bb x\n\nBut we know \u03bb = 2(\u03c1 -6)/\u03c1, so substituting:\n\n2(\u03c1 -6) * (x - d)/\u03c1 = [2(\u03c1 -6)/\u03c1] x\n\nSimplify both sides by multiplying \u03c1 / [2(\u03c1 -6)] (assuming \u03c1 \u22606):\n\n(x - d) = x\n\nWhich implies x - d =x \u21d2 -d =0 \u21d2 d=0\n\nBut d is the distance between centers. If d=0, then the generating circle is at the origin, which is the same as the sphere's center. That would imply the torus is centered at the sphere's center.

So, the equation of the torus becomes:\n\n(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + (z - h)^2 = 9.\n\nNow, the sphere is at the origin with equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121.\n\nWe need to find h such that the torus and sphere are tangent along a circle.

That can't be possible because the sphere's radius is 11, so sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) can't exceed 11. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nHmm, maybe subtracting the equations isn't the right approach. Let me think again. Since the torus is a surface, and the sphere is another, the points of tangency must satisfy both equations, and their normals must be the same at those points.\n\nLet me compute the normals for both surfaces. For the sphere, the gradient (which gives the normal vector) at any point (x, y, z) is (2x, 2y, 2z). For the torus, which is given by (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - 6)^2 + z\u00b2 = 9, the gradient would be ( (2(sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - 6) * (x / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)) ), (2(sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - 6) * (y / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)) ), 2z ).\n\nAt the points of tangency, the normals are scalar multiples of each other. So, the normals must be proportional. Let me denote the sphere's normal as (x, y, z) and the torus's normal as ( (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6) * (x / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)) , (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6) * (y / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)) , z ). \n\nSo, the normals must satisfy:\n\n( (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6) * (x / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)) , (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6) * (y / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)) , z ) = \u03bb (x, y, z)\n\nfor some scalar \u03bb.\n\nThis gives us three equations:\n\n1. (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6) * (x / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)) = \u03bb x\n2. (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6) * (y / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)) = \u03bb y\n3. z = \u03bb z\n\nFrom equation 3, either z = 0 or \u03bb = 1.\n\nIf z = 0, then from the sphere equation, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 121. But from the torus equation, when z=0, (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6)^2 = 9 => sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6 = \u00b13. So sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 9 or 3.

Maybe I should think in terms of the centers.\n\nLet me recall the standard approach for these problems. The torus can be represented parametrically, but maybe there's a simpler way. I remember that the torus can be described using the major radius (R) and the minor radius (r). In this case, the major radius is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, which is 6. The minor radius is the radius of the generating circle, which is 3. So, R = 6, r = 3.\n\nThe sphere has radius 11. So, the sphere is centered somewhere, and the torus is placed such that it is tangent to the sphere either internally or externally.",

Then,\n\ns = 7 - d/z \u2192 s + d/z =7.\n\nAlso, from the torus equation:\n\n(s -6)^2 + (z - d)^2 = 9.\n\nExpanding:\n\n(s^2 -12s +36) + (z^2 - 2dz + d^2) =9.\n\nBut s^2 = 121 - z^2, so substituting:\n\n(121 - z^2 -12s +36) + z^2 - 2dz + d^2 =9.\n\nSimplify:\n\n121 - z^2 -12s +36 + z^2 -2dz + d^2 =9 \u2192 121 +36 -12s -2dz +d^2 =9.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n157 -12s -2dz + d^2 =9 \u2192 -12s -2dz +d^2 = -148 \u2192 12s +2dz = d^2 +148.\n\nNow, from earlier, s + d/z =7 \u2192 s =7 - d/z.\n\nSubstitute s into the equation:\n\n12(7 - d/z) + 2d z = d^2 +148.\n\nExpanding:\n\n84 - (12d)/z + 2d z = d^2 +148.\n\nRearranging:\n\n2d z - (12d)/z = d^2 +148 -84 \u2192 2d z - (12d)/z = d^2 +64.\n\nMultiply both sides by z to eliminate the denominator:\n\n2d z^2 -12d = d^2 z +64 z.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n2d z^2 - d^2 z -64 z -12d =0.\n\nFactor out z where possible:\n\nz(2d z - d^2 -64) -12d =0.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.",
          "text2": "Wait, maybe my initial setup is wrong. Maybe the sphere and torus can only be tangent externally? Or perhaps I have to adjust the distance between centers. Oh, wait! I assumed the centers are aligned along the same axis, but maybe in reality, the torus is shifted such that the center of the generating circle is a certain distance away from the sphere's center.\n\nAh, that's probably it. I should have considered that the center of the generating circle is at a distance d from the sphere's center along the axis. So, in this case, the sphere is at (0,0,0), and the generating circle is at (d, 0, 0). So, the torus is now shifted along the x-axis by distance d.\n\nHmm, so the equation of the torus would then be:\n\n(\u221a( (x - d)^2 + y^2 ) -6)^2 + z^2 =9\n\nAnd the sphere is still x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2=121.\n\nAt the point of tangency, these two surfaces share a common tangent plane, so their normals are equal. Let me compute the normals.\n\nFor the sphere, the gradient (normal vector) at point (x,y,z) is (2x, 2y, 2z).\n\nFor the torus, the gradient is a bit more involved. Let me compute the partial derivatives.\n\nLet me denote F(x,y,z) = (\u221a( (x - d)^2 + y^2 ) -6)^2 + z^2 -9 =0\n\nCompute partial derivatives:\n\ndF/dx = 2(\u221a( (x - d)^2 + y^2 ) -6) * [ (x - d)/\u221a( (x - d)^2 + y^2 ) ]\n\ndF/dy = 2(\u221a( (x - d)^2 + y^2 ) -6) * [ y /\u221a( (x - d)^2 + y^2 ) ]\n\ndF/dz = 2z\n\nSo, the normal vector to the torus at (x,y,z) is:\n\n( dF/dx, dF/dy, dF/dz ) = [ 2(\u221a( (x - d)^2 + y^2 ) -6) * ( (x - d)/\u221a( (x - d)^2 + y^2 ), y/\u221a( (x - d)^2 + y^2 ), z ) ]\n\nThe normal vector to the sphere is (x, y, z).\n\nSince the normals are parallel, there exists a scalar \u03bb such that:\n\n( 2(\u221a( (x - d)^2 + y^2 ) -6) * ( (x - d)/\u221a( (x - d)^2 + y^2 ), y/\u221a( (x - d)^2 + y^2 ), z ) ) = \u03bb (x, y, z )\n\nSo, each component must satisfy:\n\n2(\u221a( (x - d)^2 + y^2 ) -6) * (x - d)/\u221a( (x - d)^2 + y^2 ) = \u03bb x\n\nSimilarly for y and z.\n\nLet me denote \u03c1 = \u221a( (x - d)^2 + y^2 )\n\nSo,\n\n2(\u03c1 -6) * (x - d)/\u03c1 = \u03bb x\n\n2(\u03c1 -6) * y / \u03c1 = \u03bb y\n\n2(\u03c1 -6) * z / \u03c1 = \u03bb z\n\nAssuming y \u22600 and z \u22600, we can divide equations.\n\nFrom the y-component:\n\n2(\u03c1 -6) * y / \u03c1 = \u03bb y \u21d2 2(\u03c1 -6)/\u03c1 = \u03bb (since y\u22600)\n\nSimilarly, from the z-component:\n\n2(\u03c1 -6) * z / \u03c1 = \u03bb z \u21d2 2(\u03c1 -6)/\u03c1 = \u03bb (since z\u22600)\n\nSo, the \u03bb is consistent for y and z. Now, from the x-component:\n\n2(\u03c1 -6) * (x - d)/\u03c1 = \u03bb x\n\nBut we know \u03bb = 2(\u03c1 -6)/\u03c1, so substituting:\n\n2(\u03c1 -6) * (x - d)/\u03c1 = [2(\u03c1 -6)/\u03c1] x\n\nSimplify both sides by multiplying \u03c1 / [2(\u03c1 -6)] (assuming \u03c1 \u22606):\n\n(x - d) = x\n\nWhich implies x - d =x \u21d2 -d =0 \u21d2 d=0\n\nBut d is the distance between centers. If d=0, then the generating circle is at the origin, which is the same as the sphere's center. That would imply the torus is centered at the sphere's center. But that's a special case where the torus is symmetric with respect to the sphere's center. But in that case, the point of tangency would be along the line where the torus is closest or farthest from the center.",

So sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6 = \u00b13, leading to sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 9 or 3. But sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) can't be 3 if x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 121, because 3^2=9 is less than 121.

Therefore, x must be zero and y must be zero. But that would imply that \u03c1=0, which can't be true.

Let me compute it.\n\nThe equation of the torus is F(x,y,z) = (\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6)^2 + z\u00b2 - 9 = 0.\n\nCompute the partial derivatives:\n\n\u2202F/\u2202x = [2(\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6) * (x / \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2))] \n\n\u2202F/\u2202y = [2(\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6) * (y / \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2))]\n\n\u2202F/\u2202z = 2z.\n\nSo, the gradient is:\n\n(2(\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6) * x / \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), 2(\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6) * y / \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), 2z).\n\nAt the point of tangency, the gradient vectors of the sphere and torus must be scalar multiples of each other.\n\nSo, for some scalar \u03bb,\n\n2x = \u03bb * 2(\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6) * x / \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2),\n\n2y = \u03bb * 2(\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6) * y / \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2),\n\n2(z - 2) = \u03bb * 2z.\n\nSimplify these equations:\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\nx = \u03bb ( (\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6) x ) / \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, from the second equation:\n\ny = \u03bb ( (\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6) y ) / \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nAssuming x \u2260 0 and y \u2260 0, we can divide both sides by x and y respectively, giving:\n\n1 = \u03bb ( (\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6) ) / \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly for y, same result. So, this implies that \u03bb is the same for both.\n\nNow, from the z-component equation:\n\n2(z - 2) = \u03bb * 2z \u2192 (z - 2) = \u03bb z \u2192 \u03bb = (z - 2)/z.\n\nSubstituting \u03bb into the first equation:\n\n1 = [ (z - 2)/z ] * [ (\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6 ) / \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) ).\n\nSimplify:\n\n1 = (z - 2)/z * [ (\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6 ) / \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) ).\n\nLet me denote s = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Then the equation becomes:\n\n1 = (z - 2)/z * (s -6)/s.\n\nSo,\n\n1 = (z - 2)(s -6)/(z s).\n\nRearranging,\n\nz s = (z - 2)(s -6).\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\nz s = z (s -6) -2 (s -6) = z s -6 z -2 s +12.\n\nSubtracting z s from both sides:\n\n0 = -6 z -2 s +12.\n\nSo,\n\n6 z + 2 s = 12 \u2192 3 z + s = 6 \u2192 s = 6 -3 z.\n\nBut s = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), so:\n\n\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 6 -3 z.\n\nNow, we can use this in the sphere's equation and the torus's equation.\n\nSphere's equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + (z - 2)^2 = 121.\n\nSubstitute x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = s^2 = (6 -3 z)^2 = 36 -36 z +9 z^2.\n\nSo,\n\n36 -36 z +9 z^2 + (z^2 -4 z +4) = 121.\n\nSimplify:\n\n36 -36 z +9 z^2 + z^2 -4 z +4 = 121.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n10 z^2 -40 z +40 = 121.\n\nSubtract 121:\n\n10 z^2 -40 z -81 = 0.\n\nDivide by 10:\n\nz^2 -4 z -8.1 = 0.",

Then the equation becomes:\n\ns\u00b2 - (s - 6)^2 = 112.\n\nExpand (s - 6)^2:\n\ns\u00b2 - (s\u00b2 -12s + 36) = 112.\n\nSimplify:\n\ns\u00b2 - s\u00b2 +12s -36 = 112.\n\nSo, 12s -36 = 112.\n\n12s = 112 +36 = 148.\n\ns = 148 / 12 = 37 / 3 \u2248 12.333...",

Maybe I should approach this problem using the concept of the distance between the centers and the radii.\n\nIn 3D, when two surfaces are tangent, the distance between their centers is equal to the sum or difference of their radii, depending on whether they are externally or internally tangent.\n\nBut the torus isn't a sphere, so that might not apply directly. However, perhaps the circle of tangency lies in a plane, and the distance from the sphere's center to that plane can be used to find the radii r_i and r_o.\n\nLet me think: When the torus is inside the sphere, the circle of tangency lies on the sphere's surface, and the distance from the sphere's center to this circle is d_i. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the distance is d_o.\n\nIn each case, using the Pythagorean theorem, the radius of the circle (r_i or r_o) can be found from the sphere's radius and the distance d.\n\nSo, for the sphere, the radius is 11, so for the internal tangent, r_i = sqrt(11\u00b2 - d_i\u00b2),\n\nand for the external tangent, r_o = sqrt(11\u00b2 - d_o\u00b2).",

However, the sphere is fixed at the origin. So, when the torus is shifted, the points of tangency would change.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nLet me denote the torus as being shifted along the z-axis by a distance h. So, the equation of the torus becomes:\n\n(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + (z - h)^2 = 9.\n\nNow, the sphere is at the origin with equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121.\n\nWe need to find h such that the torus and sphere are tangent along a circle. The points of tangency must satisfy both equations and have the same tangent plane.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps we can find the condition for tangency.\n\nLet me consider a point (x, y, z) on both the torus and the sphere, and the gradients (normals) are scalar multiples.\n\nThe normal to the sphere is (x, y, z).\n\nThe normal to the torus is:\n\nFrom F(x, y, z) = (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + (z - h)^2 - 9 = 0.\n\nCompute the partial derivatives:\n\ndF/dx = 2 (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (x / sqrt(x^2 + y^2))\ndF/dy = 2 (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (y / sqrt(x^2 + y^2))\ndF/dz = 2 (z - h)\n\nSo, the gradient is proportional to:\n\n[ (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (x / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)),  \n  (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (y / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)),  \n  (z - h) ]\n\nSetting this proportional to the sphere's normal (x, y, z):\n\n[ (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (x / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)),  \n  (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (y / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)),  \n  (z - h) ]  \n= \u03bb [x, y, z]\n\nSo, component-wise:\n\n1. (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (x / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) = \u03bb x\n2. (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (y / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) = \u03bb y\n3. (z - h) = \u03bb z\n\nFrom equation 3: \u03bb = (z - h)/z, provided z \u2260 0.\n\nFrom equations 1 and 2, let me consider that x and y are not zero (since if x=0 and y=0, the point would be (0,0,z), but that point isn't on the torus as we saw earlier). So, dividing both sides by x and y respectively:\n\n1. (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) / sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = \u03bb\n2. (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) / sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = \u03bb\n\nSo, equations 1 and 2 give the same result, which is consistent.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\u03bb = (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)\nand\n\u03bb = (z - h)/z\n\nTherefore,\n\n(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) / sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = (z - h)/z\n\nLet me denote r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2). Then,\n\n(r - 6)/r = (z - h)/z\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\nz (r - 6) = r (z - h)\nz r - 6 z = r z - r h\n-6 z = - r h\n6 z = r h\nSo,\n\nr = (6 z)/h\n\nSo, we have r = 6 z / h.\n\nNow, this relates r and z at the point of tangency.\n\nAlso, since the point (x, y, z) lies on both the sphere and the torus.\n\nFrom the sphere: x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121. Since r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2), this becomes:\n\nr^2 + z^2 = 121.\n\nFrom the torus: (r - 6)^2 + (z - h)^2 = 9.\n\nWe also have r = (6 z)/h.\n\nLet me substitute r = (6 z)/h into the sphere's equation:\n\n[(6 z)/h]^2 + z^2 = 121\n(36 z^2)/h^2 + z^2 = 121\nz^2 (36/h^2 + 1) = 121\nz^2 = 121 / (36/h^2 + 1)\n= 121 h^2 / (36 + h^2)\n\nSimilarly, substitute r = (6 z)/h into the torus's equation:\n\n(r - 6)^2 + (z - h)^2 = 9\n( (6 z / h ) - 6 )^2 + (z - h)^2 = 9\n[6(z/h - 1)]^2 + (z - h)^2 = 9\n36 (z/h - 1)^2 + (z - h)^2 = 9\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n36 ( (z - h)/h )^2 + (z - h)^2 = 9\n36 (z - h)^2 / h^2 + (z - h)^2 = 9\nFactor out (z - h)^2:\n\n(z - h)^2 (36 / h^2 + 1) = 9\n\nSo,\n\n(z - h)^2 = 9 / (36 / h^2 + 1)\n= 9 h^2 / (36 + h^2)\n\nTherefore,\n\nz - h = \u00b1 3 h / sqrt(36 + h^2)\n\nThus,\n\nz = h \u00b1 (3 h) / sqrt(36 + h^2)\n\nBut since the torus is placed either inside or outside the sphere, we can consider the appropriate sign.\n\nCase 1: Torus inside the sphere (rests on the inside). In this case, the point of tangency would be above the center, so z is positive. So,\n\nz = h + (3 h) / sqrt(36 + h^2)\n\nBut let me see.",

At that point, the normals to both surfaces must be the same. Let's find the normals.\n\nFor the sphere S: x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121. The gradient (normal vector) at any point (x, y, z) is (2x, 2y, 2z), or simply (x, y, z).\n\nFor the torus T: (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9. Let me compute the gradient.\n\nLet F(x, y, z) = (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 - 9 = 0.\n\nCompute the partial derivatives:\n\ndF/dx = 2 (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (x / sqrt(x^2 + y^2))\ndF/dy = 2 (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (y / sqrt(x^2 + y^2))\ndF/dz = 2 z\n\nSo, the gradient vector is:\n\n[ 2 (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (x / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)),  \n  2 (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (y / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)),  \n  2 z ]\n\nWe can factor out 2:\n\n2 [ (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (x / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)),  \n     (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (y / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)),  \n     z ]\n\nSo, the normal vector to the torus is proportional to:\n\n[ (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (x / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)),  \n  (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (y / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)),  \n  z ]\n\nSimilarly, the normal vector to the sphere is (x, y, z).\n\nAt the point of tangency, these normals must be scalar multiples of each other. So, there exists a scalar \u03bb such that:\n\n[ (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (x / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)),  \n  (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (y / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)),  \n  z ]  \n= \u03bb [x, y, z]\n\nSo, component-wise:\n\n1. (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (x / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) = \u03bb x\n2. (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (y / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) = \u03bb y\n3. z = \u03bb z\n\nFrom equation 3: If z \u2260 0, then \u03bb = 1. If z = 0, then equation 3 is satisfied for any \u03bb.\n\nBut let's consider the case where z \u2260 0, so \u03bb = 1.\n\nSubstituting \u03bb = 1 into equations 1 and 2:\n\n1. (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (x / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) = x\n2. (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (y / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) = y\n\nLet me simplify equation 1:\n\n[ (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) / sqrt(x^2 + y^2) ] * x = x\n\nIf x \u2260 0, we can divide both sides by x:\n\n(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) / sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 1\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(x^2 + y^2):\n\nsqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6 = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)\n\nWhich simplifies to -6 = 0, which is impossible. Therefore, our assumption that x \u2260 0 is wrong, so x = 0.\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2, if y \u2260 0, same reasoning would lead to a contradiction, so y must also be 0.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is x = 0 and y = 0. But then, the point (0, 0, z) must lie on both the torus and the sphere.\n\nFrom the sphere: 0^2 + 0^2 + z^2 = 121 => z = \u00b111.\n\nFrom the torus: (sqrt(0 + 0) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9 => (-6)^2 + z^2 = 9 => 36 + z^2 = 9 => z^2 = -27. Which is impossible.\n\nSo, the only possible solution is when z = 0, which would require x = 0 and y = 0, but that point isn't on the torus either, as we've seen.\n\nTherefore, there is no point where the normals are equal when z \u2260 0. So, perhaps the only possibility is when z = 0, but that also doesn't work. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the torus and sphere do not have a point of tangency in the usual sense. But the problem states that when T rests on the inside or outside of S, it is tangent along a circle. So, perhaps my approach is incorrect.",

Let's compute the gradient.\n\nLet me denote f(x,y,z) = (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 - 9 = 0.\n\nThe gradient of f is:\n\ndf/dx = 2(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) -6) * (x / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)),\n\ndf/dy = 2(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) -6) * (y / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)),\n\ndf/dz = 2z.\n\nSo, the gradient vector is:\n\n( (2(sqrt(r) -6) * x)/sqrt(r), (2(sqrt(r)-6) * y)/sqrt(r), 2z ), where r = x^2 + y^2.\n\nSince the normals must be colinear at the point of tangency, the gradient of S must be proportional to the gradient of T.\n\nSo, there exists a scalar \u03bb such that:\n\n(2x, 2y, 2z) = \u03bb * ( (2(sqrt(r)-6) * x)/sqrt(r), (2(sqrt(r)-6) * y)/sqrt(r), 2z ).\n\nHmm, so component-wise:\n\n2x = \u03bb * [2(sqrt(r)-6) * x / sqrt(r)]\n\n2y = \u03bb * [2(sqrt(r)-6) * y / sqrt(r)]\n\n2z = \u03bb * 2z.\n\nSo, let's analyze these equations.\n\nFirst, for the z-component:\n\n2z = \u03bb * 2z.\n\nAssuming z \u2260 0 (if z=0, then perhaps it's a different case, but let's consider z \u2260 0 first), we can divide both sides by 2z, getting:\n\n1 = \u03bb.\n\nSo \u03bb = 1.\n\nNow, substitute \u03bb=1 into the x and y components.\n\nFrom x-component:\n\n2x = [2(sqrt(r)-6) * x / sqrt(r)].\n\nDivide both sides by 2x (assuming x\u22600, same logic as above):\n\n1 = (sqrt(r) -6)/sqrt(r).\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(r):\n\nsqrt(r) = sqrt(r) -6.",

Then, the equation of the torus would be (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + (z - d)^2 = 9.\n\nThen, the sphere is at the origin, x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121.\n\nNow, when the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the distance between their centers is d, and we can model the points of tangency.\n\nSimilarly, when the torus is outside, it's placed such that it's externally tangent to the sphere.\n\nThis seems promising. Let me try this approach.\n\nSo, the sphere is at the origin, and the torus's generating circle is centered at (0, 0, d). The torus equation becomes (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + (z - d)^2 = 9.\n\nThe sphere's equation is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121.\n\nNow, the points of tangency must lie along a circle where both equations are satisfied, and the normals are equal.\n\nLet me find the condition for tangency.\n\nThe sphere's normal at (x, y, z) is (2x, 2y, 2z).\n\nThe torus's normal at (x, y, z) is the gradient of F(x, y, z) = (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + (z - d)^2 - 9.\n\nCompute the gradient:\n\ndF/dx = 2(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) -6) * (x / sqrt(x^2 + y^2))\ndF/dy = 2(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) -6) * (y / sqrt(x^2 + y^2))\ndF/dz = 2(z - d)\n\nSo, the normal vector to the torus is (x(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) -6), y(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) -6), 2(z - d)).\n\nFor the normals to be colinear, there must exist a scalar \u03bb such that:\n\nx(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) -6) = \u03bb x\ny(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) -6) = \u03bb y\n2(z - d) = \u03bb 2z\n\nAssuming x, y, z \u2260 0, we can divide:\n\nFrom x and y components:\n\nsqrt(x^2 + y^2) -6 = \u03bb\n\nFrom the z component:\n\n2(z - d) = 2\u03bb z \u2192 z - d = \u03bb z \u2192 \u03bb = (z - d)/z = 1 - d/z\n\nSo, we have sqrt(x^2 + y^2) -6 = 1 - d/z \u2192 sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 7 - d/z.\n\nNow, since the point lies on the sphere, x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121 \u2192 x^2 + y^2 = 121 - z^2.\n\nSubstituting into the equation from the normals:\n\nsqrt(121 - z^2) = 7 - d/z \u2192 Let me denote s = sqrt(121 - z^2).

I assumed the centers are aligned along the same axis, but maybe in reality, the torus is shifted such that the center of the generating circle is a certain distance away from the sphere's center.\n\nAh, that's probably it. I should have considered that the center of the generating circle is at a distance d from the sphere's center along the axis. So, in this case, the sphere is at (0,0,0), and the generating circle is at (d, 0, 0). So, the torus is now shifted along the x-axis by distance d.\n\nHmm, so the equation of the torus would then be:\n\n(\u221a( (x - d)^2 + y^2 ) -6)^2 + z^2 =9\n\nAnd the sphere is still x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2=121.\n\nAt the point of tangency, these two surfaces share a common tangent plane, so their normals are equal. Let me compute the normals.\n\nFor the sphere, the gradient (normal vector) at point (x,y,z) is (2x, 2y, 2z).\n\nFor the torus, the gradient is a bit more involved.

Now, from the x-component:\n\n2(\u03c1 -6) * (x - d)/\u03c1 = \u03bb x\n\nBut we know \u03bb = 2(\u03c1 -6)/\u03c1, so substituting:\n\n2(\u03c1 -6) * (x - d)/\u03c1 = [2(\u03c1 -6)/\u03c1] x\n\nSimplify both sides by multiplying \u03c1 / [2(\u03c1 -6)] (assuming \u03c1 \u22606):\n\n(x - d) = x\n\nWhich implies x - d =x \u21d2 -d =0 \u21d2 d=0\n\nBut d is the distance between centers.

I remember that the torus can be described using the major radius (R) and the minor radius (r). In this case, the major radius is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, which is 6. The minor radius is the radius of the generating circle, which is 3. So, R = 6, r = 3.\n\nThe sphere has radius 11. So, the sphere is centered somewhere, and the torus is placed such that it is tangent to the sphere either internally or externally.",

At that point, the normals to both surfaces must be the same. Let's find the normals.\n\nFor the sphere S: x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121.

If z = 0, then equation 3 is satisfied for any \u03bb.\n\nBut let's consider the case where z \u2260 0, so \u03bb = 1.\n\nSubstituting \u03bb = 1 into equations 1 and 2:\n\n1. (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (x / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) = x\n2. (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (y / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) = y\n\nLet me simplify equation 1:\n\n[ (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) / sqrt(x^2 + y^2) ] * x = x\n\nIf x \u2260 0, we can divide both sides by x:\n\n(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) / sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 1\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(x^2 + y^2):\n\nsqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6 = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)\n\nWhich simplifies to -6 = 0, which is impossible. Therefore, our assumption that x \u2260 0 is wrong, so x = 0.\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2, if y \u2260 0, same reasoning would lead to a contradiction, so y must also be 0.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is x = 0 and y = 0.

Which is impossible.\n\nSo, the only possible solution is when z = 0, which would require x = 0 and y = 0, but that point isn't on the torus either, as we've seen.\n\nTherefore, there is no point where the normals are equal when z \u2260 0. So, perhaps the only possibility is when z = 0, but that also doesn't work. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the torus and sphere do not have a point of tangency in the usual sense.

Let me compute it.\n\nThe equation of the torus is F(x,y,z) = (\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6)^2 + z\u00b2 - 9 = 0.\n\nCompute the partial derivatives:\n\n\u2202F/\u2202x = [2(\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6) * (x / \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2))] \n\n\u2202F/\u2202y = [2(\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6) * (y / \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2))]\n\n\u2202F/\u2202z = 2z.\n\nSo, the gradient is:\n\n(2(\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6) * x / \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), 2(\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6) * y / \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), 2z).\n\nAt the point of tangency, the gradient vectors of the sphere and torus must be scalar multiples of each other.\n\nSo, for some scalar \u03bb,\n\n2x = \u03bb * 2(\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6) * x / \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2),\n\n2y = \u03bb * 2(\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6) * y / \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2),\n\n2(z - 2) = \u03bb * 2z.\n\nSimplify these equations:\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\nx = \u03bb ( (\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6) x ) / \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, from the second equation:\n\ny = \u03bb ( (\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6) y ) / \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nAssuming x \u2260 0 and y \u2260 0, we can divide both sides by x and y respectively, giving:\n\n1 = \u03bb ( (\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6) ) / \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly for y, same result. So, this implies that \u03bb is the same for both.\n\nNow, from the z-component equation:\n\n2(z - 2) = \u03bb * 2z \u2192 (z - 2) = \u03bb z \u2192 \u03bb = (z - 2)/z.\n\nSubstituting \u03bb into the first equation:\n\n1 = [ (z - 2)/z ] * [ (\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6 ) / \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) ).\n\nSimplify:\n\n1 = (z - 2)/z * [ (\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6 ) / \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) ).\n\nLet me denote s = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Then the equation becomes:\n\n1 = (z - 2)/z * (s -6)/s.\n\nSo,\n\n1 = (z - 2)(s -6)/(z s).\n\nRearranging,\n\nz s = (z - 2)(s -6).\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\nz s = z (s -6) -2 (s -6) = z s -6 z -2 s +12.\n\nSubtracting z s from both sides:\n\n0 = -6 z -2 s +12.\n\nSo,\n\n6 z + 2 s = 12 \u2192 3 z + s = 6 \u2192 s = 6 -3 z.\n\nBut s = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), so:\n\n\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 6 -3 z.\n\nNow, we can use this in the sphere's equation and the torus's equation.\n\nSphere's equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + (z - 2)^2 = 121.\n\nSubstitute x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = s^2 = (6 -3 z)^2 = 36 -36 z +9 z^2.\n\nSo,\n\n36 -36 z +9 z^2 + (z^2 -4 z +4) = 121.\n\nSimplify:\n\n36 -36 z +9 z^2 + z^2 -4 z +4 = 121.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n10 z^2 -40 z +40 = 121.\n\nSubtract 121:\n\n10 z^2 -40 z -81 = 0.\n\nDivide by 10:\n\nz^2 -4 z -8.1 = 0.",

The minor radius r is the radius of the tube itself.\n\nSo, in this problem, R is 6, and r is 3.\n\nSo, the torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, the resulting torus's major radius is 6, and minor radius 3.\n\nSo, the standard equation for such a torus is:\n\n( sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R )^2 + z^2 = r^2\n\nWhich in this case is:\n\n( sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6 )^2 + z^2 = 9\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nNow, the sphere is centered at (0,0,0) with radius 11.\n\nWe need to find the circles where the sphere and torus are tangent. Let's consider the case when the torus is inside the sphere (internally tangent) and when it's outside (externally tangent).\n\nLet me first consider the internal tangent case.\n\nThe sphere has radius 11, and the torus is inside it. The point of tangency would be the point on the torus that is closest to the sphere's center, right? Because when the torus is inside, the sphere's surface is at 11 units from the origin, and the torus touches it at the point closest to the origin.",

The equation of a torus in 3D can be written in Cartesian coordinates as:\n\n(\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - R)\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = r\u00b2\n\nWhere R is the major radius (distance from center to the tube's center) and r is the minor radius.\n\nIn our case, R = 6, r = 3.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n(\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - 6)\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 9\n\nAnd the sphere has equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 11\u00b2 = 121.\n\nWhen the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent along a circle. So, the points of tangency lie on both the sphere and the torus. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the points lie on both surfaces.\n\nSince both the sphere and the torus are symmetric around the z-axis, the tangent circle must lie in a plane perpendicular to the z-axis, say at a height z = c.

Now, from the x-component:\n\n2(\u03c1 -6) * (x - d)/\u03c1 = \u03bb x\n\nBut we know \u03bb = 2(\u03c1 -6)/\u03c1, so substituting:\n\n2(\u03c1 -6) * (x - d)/\u03c1 = [2(\u03c1 -6)/\u03c1] x\n\nSimplify both sides by multiplying \u03c1 / [2(\u03c1 -6)] (assuming \u03c1 \u22606):\n\n(x - d) = x\n\nWhich implies x - d =x \u21d2 -d =0 \u21d2 d=0\n\nBut d is the distance between centers. If d=0, then the generating circle is at the origin, which is the same as the sphere's center. That would imply the torus is centered at the sphere's center. But that's a special case where the torus is symmetric with respect to the sphere's center. But in that case, the point of tangency would be along the line where the torus is closest or farthest from the center.",

So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nHmm, maybe subtracting the equations isn't the right approach. Let me think again. Since the torus is a surface, and the sphere is another, the points of tangency must satisfy both equations, and their normals must be the same at those points.\n\nLet me compute the normals for both surfaces. For the sphere, the gradient (which gives the normal vector) at any point (x, y, z) is (2x, 2y, 2z). For the torus, which is given by (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - 6)^2 + z\u00b2 = 9, the gradient would be ( (2(sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - 6) * (x / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)) ), (2(sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - 6) * (y / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)) ), 2z ).\n\nAt the points of tangency, the normals are scalar multiples of each other.

In this plane, both the torus and the sphere will have circles.\n\nFor the sphere, in the plane x=k, the radius is sqrt(121 - k^2).\n\nFor the torus, in the plane x=k, the equation becomes (sqrt(y^2 + z^2) -6)^2 + k^2 =9.\n\nSo, sqrt(y^2 + z^2) =6 \u00b1 sqrt(9 -k^2).\n\nBut since sqrt(y^2 + z^2) must be real, 9 -k^2 >=0 \u2192 k^2 <=9 \u2192 |k| <=3.\n\nSo, in the plane x=k, the torus has two circles (inner and outer) at radii 6 - sqrt(9 -k^2) and 6 + sqrt(9 -k^2). But since the torus is only the surface, these are the radii in the y-z plane.\n\nNow, the sphere's radius in the plane x=k is sqrt(121 -k^2). When the torus is tangent to the sphere in this plane, the circle of the torus must coincide with the circle of the sphere. Therefore, the radius of the torus's circle in this plane must equal the radius of the sphere's circle in this plane.\n\nSo, we have two cases:\n\n1. Internal tangency: The torus is inside the sphere, so the outer circle of the torus touches the sphere's inner circle. So, 6 + sqrt(9 -k^2) = sqrt(121 -k^2).\n\n2. External tangency: The torus is outside the sphere, so the inner circle of the torus touches the sphere's outer circle. So, 6 - sqrt(9 -k^2) = sqrt(121 -k^2).",

So, this leads to a contradiction. Therefore, there is no solution when z = 0.\n\nCase 2: \u03bb = 1.\n\nSo, from the first two equations:\n\nx(s -6)/s = x\n\ny(s -6)/s = y\n\nWhere s = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nAssuming x \u2260 0 and y \u2260 0 (if either x or y is zero, we can check that case separately).\n\nSo, from x(s -6)/s = x, since x \u2260 0, we can divide both sides by x:\n\n(s -6)/s = 1\n\nMultiply both sides by s:\n\ns -6 = s\n\nWhich implies -6 = 0, which is impossible. Therefore, the only possibility is x = 0 and y = 0. But if x = 0 and y = 0, then from the sphere equation, z^2 = 121, so z = \u00b111. But in that case, s = \u221a(0 + 0) = 0, and the torus equation would have (0 -6)^2 + z^2 = 9 => 36 + z^2 = 9 => z^2 = -27, which is impossible. So, no solution in this case.\n\nTherefore, the only possible case is when \u03bb = 1, but that led to a contradiction unless x = y = 0, which isn't possible.
