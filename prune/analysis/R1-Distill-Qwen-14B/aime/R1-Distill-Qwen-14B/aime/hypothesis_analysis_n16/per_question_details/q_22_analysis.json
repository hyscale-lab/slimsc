So AB, CD, EF are sides of the hexagon that, when extended, meet at the vertices of the larger triangle. That makes sense.\n\nSo, if I imagine the triangle with sides 200, 240, 300, and inside it, the hexagon is such that each of AB, CD, EF is a segment on the sides of the triangle, and the hexagon is formed by connecting these segments.\n\nSince the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, the sides of the hexagon are all equal, and each pair of opposite sides is parallel. So, each side of the hexagon is parallel to the side of the triangle it's closest to.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can use similar triangles here. Because when you extend AB, CD, EF, they form the larger triangle, so the hexagon must be a result of cutting off similar triangles from the larger triangle.\n\nLet me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. Since the hexagon is equilateral, each side is length 's'. And because opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon must have three pairs of sides, each pair parallel.\n\nSo, for each pair of opposite sides, they are each parallel to a side of the larger triangle. For example, AB and DE are opposite and parallel, CD and FA are opposite and parallel, EF and BC are opposite and parallel?",

Then, the distances are: A'B' = 200, B'C' = 240, A'C' = 300.\n\nSo, I can compute the coordinates of C' using the distance formula.\n\nFirst, distance from A'(0,0) to C'(x,y) is 300, so:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 300\u00b2 ... (1)\n\nDistance from B'(200,0) to C'(x,y) is 240, so:\n\n(x - 200)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 240\u00b2 ... (2)\n\nSubtracting equation (2) from equation (1):\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - [(x - 200)\u00b2 + y\u00b2] = 300\u00b2 - 240\u00b2\n\nExpanding:\n\nx\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 - 400x + 40000) = 90000 - 57600\n\nSimplify left side:\n\nx\u00b2 - x\u00b2 + 400x - 40000 = 400x - 40000\n\nRight side:\n\n32400\n\nSo,\n\n400x - 40000 = 32400\n\n400x = 32400 + 40000 = 72400\n\nx = 72400 / 400 = 181\n\nSo, x = 181.\n\nPlugging back into equation (1):\n\n181\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 90000\n\nCalculating 181\u00b2: 180\u00b2 is 32400, so 181\u00b2 is 32761.\n\nSo,\n\n32761 + y\u00b2 = 90000\n\ny\u00b2 = 90000 - 32761 = 57239\n\nSo, y = sqrt(57239) \u2248 239.246, but let's keep it exact for now.\n\nSo, point C' is at (181, sqrt(57239)).\n\nSo now, triangle T has coordinates A'(0,0), B'(200,0), and C'(181, sqrt(57239)).\n\nNow, the hexagon ABCDEF is inside this triangle, with AB, CD, EF extended forming triangle T. So, each of AB, CD, EF is a side of the hexagon, and when extended, they meet at the vertices of T.\n\nSo, let me think: The hexagon has sides AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA. Each side is length 's', and opposite sides are parallel.\n\nSince AB is a side of the hexagon, when extended, it becomes side A'B' of triangle T. Similarly, CD extended becomes another side, and EF extended becomes the third side.",
