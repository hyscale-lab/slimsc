Tangent at B: y = (-56\u221a14 /311)(x -39/5) + 6\u221a14/5.\n\nSo, let's set them equal to find x.\n\nSet -4\u221a14 x = (-56\u221a14 /311)(x -39/5) +6\u221a14/5.\n\nLet me divide both sides by \u221a14 to simplify:\n\n-4x = (-56/311)(x -39/5) +6/5.\n\nMultiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-4x *311 = -56(x -39/5) +6/5 *311.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nLeft side: -1244x.\n\nRight side: -56x + (56*39)/5 + (6*311)/5.\n\nCompute 56*39: 56*40=2240, minus 56=2240-56=2184.\n\nSo, (56*39)/5 =2184/5.\n\nCompute 6*311=1866. So, 1866/5.\n\nSo, right side becomes: -56x +2184/5 +1866/5.\n\nCombine constants: (2184 +1866)/5 =4050/5=810.\n\nSo, right side is -56x +810.\n\nSo, equation: -1244x = -56x +810.\n\nBring -56x to left: -1244x +56x =810 \u21d2 -1188x=810 \u21d2 x=810 / (-1188) = -810/1188.\n\nSimplify: divide numerator and denominator by 9: 810 \u00f79=90, 1188 \u00f79=132. So, x= -90/132. Divide numerator and denominator by 6: 90 \u00f76=15, 132 \u00f76=22. So, x= -15/22.\n\nSo, x= -15/22.\n\nNow, substitute x into tangent at C to find y: y= -4\u221a14 x = -4\u221a14*(-15/22)=60\u221a14/22=30\u221a14/11.\n\nSo, point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, I need to find line AD.\n\nPoint A is at (10,0), and point D is at (-15/22,30\u221a14/11).\n\nCompute the equation of line AD.\n\nFirst, find the slope:\n\nm_AD = (30\u221a14/11 -0)/( -15/22 -10) = (30\u221a14/11)/(-15/22 -220/22) = (30\u221a14/11)/(-235/22).\n\nSimplify denominator: -235/22.\n\nSo, slope m_AD = (30\u221a14/11) * (22/-235) = (30\u221a14 *22)/(11*(-235)).\n\nSimplify: 30 and 11 can stay, but 22 and 11: 22 \u00f711=2. So, becomes (30\u221a14 *2)/(-235) =60\u221a14/(-235)= -60\u221a14/235.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator by 5: 60 \u00f75=12, 235 \u00f75=47.\n\nSo, m_AD= -12\u221a14/47.\n\nSo, the equation of line AD is y -0 = (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nThus, y= (-12\u221a14/47)x + (120\u221a14)/47.\n\nNow, we need to find the other intersection point P of line AD with circle \u03c9.\n\nWe have the equation of line AD and the equation of the circle. Let's substitute y from line AD into the circle equation and solve for x.\n\nCircle equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y =0.\n\nSubstitute y= (-12\u221a14/47)x +120\u221a14/47.\n\nLet me compute y first:\n\ny = (-12\u221a14/47)x +120\u221a14/47.\n\nLet me denote y as y = m x + c, where m= -12\u221a14/47 and c=120\u221a14/47.\n\nSo, y = m x + c.\n\nNow, substitute into circle equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + (m x + c)^2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)(m x +c) =0.\n\nLet me expand each term:\n\nFirst term: x\u00b2.\n\nSecond term: (m x +c)^2 = m\u00b2x\u00b2 + 2mc x +c\u00b2.\n\nThird term: -10x.\n\nFourth term: -(5\u221a14/28)(m x +c) = -(5\u221a14 m /28)x -5\u221a14 c /28.\n\nSo, now, putting all together:\n\nx\u00b2 + m\u00b2x\u00b2 +2mc x +c\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14 m /28)x -5\u221a14 c /28=0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(1 + m\u00b2)x\u00b2 + [2mc -10 -5\u221a14 m /28]x + [c\u00b2 -5\u221a14 c /28] =0.\n\nThis is a quadratic in x. Since line AD passes through A(10,0), which is on the circle, x=10 is one solution. The other solution will be x-coordinate of P.\n\nSo, let me plug in x=10 into the equation. It should satisfy.\n\nBut perhaps instead of expanding everything, I can use the fact that x=10 is a root, so I can factor out (x -10).\n\nBut let me proceed step by step.\n\nCompute coefficients:\n\nCoefficient of x\u00b2: 1 + m\u00b2.\n\nCompute m= -12\u221a14/47, so m\u00b2= (144*14)/(47\u00b2)= 2016/2209.\n\nSo, 1 + m\u00b2=1 +2016/2209= (2209 +2016)/2209=4225/2209.\n\nCoefficient of x\u00b2:4225/2209.\n\nCoefficient of x:\n\n2 m c -10 - (5\u221a14 m)/28.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n2 m c: 2*(-12\u221a14/47)*(120\u221a14/47).\n\nCompute this:\n\n2*(-12\u221a14/47)*(120\u221a14/47) = 2*(-12*120)*(\u221a14 *\u221a14)/(47*47).\n\n\u221a14*\u221a14=14.\n\nSo, 2*(-1440)*14/(47\u00b2).",

So, the perpendicular bisector is vertical, x = 5.\n\nSo, O lies at the intersection of x=5 and the perpendicular bisector of AB.\n\nSo, plug x=5 into the equation of the perpendicular bisector of AB:\n\ny - 3\u221a14/5 = (11/(6\u221a14))(5 - 89/10).\n\nCompute 5 - 89/10: 5 is 50/10, so 50/10 - 89/10 = -39/10.\n\nSo, y - 3\u221a14/5 = (11/(6\u221a14))*(-39/10) = (-429)/(60\u221a14) = (-143)/(20\u221a14).\n\nSo, y = 3\u221a14/5 - 143/(20\u221a14).\n\nLet me rationalize the second term:\n\n143/(20\u221a14) = 143\u221a14/(20*14) = 143\u221a14/280.\n\nSo, y = (3\u221a14/5) - (143\u221a14/280).\n\nConvert 3\u221a14/5 to 168\u221a14/280.\n\nSo, y = (168\u221a14 - 143\u221a14)/280 = (25\u221a14)/280 = 5\u221a14/56.\n\nSo, the circumcenter O is at (5, 5\u221a14/56).",

(1)\n\nAlso, BC=9, so distance from B to C is 9:\nsqrt[(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2] = 9\n=> x^2 + y^2 = 81. (2)\n\nSubtract equation (2) from equation (1):\n\n(x - 10)^2 + y^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = 25 - 81\nExpand (x -10)^2: x^2 - 20x + 100 + y^2 - x^2 - y^2 = -56\nSimplify: -20x + 100 = -56\n=> -20x = -156\n=> x = 156 / 20 = 39/5 = 7.8\n\nSo x = 39/5. Now plug back into equation (2) to find y:\n\n(39/5)^2 + y^2 = 81\nCompute (39/5)^2: 39^2 = 1521, 1521/25 = 60.84\n\nSo 60.84 + y^2 = 81\n=> y^2 = 81 - 60.84 = 20.16\nWhich is 2016/100 = 504/25. So y = sqrt(504/25) = (sqrt(504))/5.\n\nSimplify sqrt(504): 504 = 16 * 31.5, but wait, earlier we saw 504 = 7*8*9, so sqrt(504) = sqrt(7*8*9) = sqrt(7)*sqrt(8)*sqrt(9) = 3*2\u221a14 = 6\u221a14. So sqrt(504) = 6\u221a14, so y = (6\u221a14)/5.\n\nSo coordinates of B are (39/5, 6\u221a14/5).\n\nSo points:\n\nA: (10,0)\nB: (39/5, 6\u221a14/5)\nC: (0,0)\n\nNow, find the circumcircle \u03c9 of triangle ABC.\n\nThe circumcircle can be found by finding the perpendicular bisectors of two sides and finding their intersection, which is the circumcenter O.\n\nLet me compute the perpendicular bisector of AB and AC, or maybe AB and BC.",

Then, I can compute coordinates of B, then find the equations of the tangents at B and C, find their intersection D, then find equation of line AD, find its intersection with the circle again at P, and then compute AP.\n\nThis might be a bit involved, but perhaps manageable.\n\nFirst, let's assign coordinates:\n\nLet\u2019s set point C at (0,0), point A at (10,0).

Since line AD passes through A(10,0), which is on the circle, x=10 is one solution. The other solution will be x-coordinate of P.\n\nSo, let me plug in x=10 into the equation.

Midpoint M_AC=(5,0).\n\nSlope of AC is (0-0)/(0-10)=0, so it's horizontal. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector is vertical, so its equation is x=5.\n\nSo, the perpendicular bisector of AC is x=5.\n\nNow, we can find the circumcenter O as the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC.\n\nWe have one perpendicular bisector as x=5. Now, we need the equation of the perpendicular bisector of AB.\n\nWe have the midpoint M_AB=(89/10, 3\u221a14/5) and the slope 11/(6\u221a14).\n\nSo, the equation is (y - 3\u221a14/5) = (11/(6\u221a14))(x - 89/10).\n\nNow, we can plug x=5 into this equation to find y-coordinate of O.\n\nSo, substituting x=5:\n\ny - 3\u221a14/5 = (11/(6\u221a14))(5 - 89/10).\n\nCompute 5 -89/10: 5 is 50/10, so 50/10 -89/10= -39/10.\n\nSo,\n\ny - 3\u221a14/5 = (11/(6\u221a14))*(-39/10) = (-429)/(60\u221a14) = (-143)/(20\u221a14).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14 to rationalize:\n\n(-143\u221a14)/(20*14) = (-143\u221a14)/(280).\n\nSo, y = 3\u221a14/5 + (-143\u221a14)/(280).\n\nConvert 3\u221a14/5 to denominator 280:\n\n3\u221a14/5 = (3\u221a14 *56)/(5*56) = 168\u221a14/280.\n\nSo,\n\ny = (168\u221a14 -143\u221a14)/280 = (25\u221a14)/280 = (5\u221a14)/56.\n\nSo, circumcenter O is at (5, 5\u221a14/56).",

Hmm, maybe I can find O as the circumcenter of triangle ABC.\n\nYes, since ABC is inscribed in \u03c9, \u03c9 is the circumcircle, so O is the circumcenter.\n\nSo, let's compute the circumcenter O of triangle ABC. To find the circumcenter, I can find the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC.\n\nGiven points A(10,0), B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5), C(0,0).

Midpoint of AC: (5, 0), since AC is from (10,0) to (0,0). The midpoint is (5,0). The slope of AC is 0, since it's along the x-axis. So, the perpendicular bisector is vertical, x = 5.\n\nSo, O lies at the intersection of x=5 and the perpendicular bisector of AB.\n\nSo, plug x=5 into the equation of the perpendicular bisector of AB:\n\ny - 3\u221a14/5 = (11/(6\u221a14))(5 - 89/10).\n\nCompute 5 - 89/10: 5 is 50/10, so 50/10 - 89/10 = -39/10.\n\nSo, y - 3\u221a14/5 = (11/(6\u221a14))*(-39/10) = (-429)/(60\u221a14) = (-143)/(20\u221a14).\n\nSo, y = 3\u221a14/5 - 143/(20\u221a14).\n\nLet me rationalize the second term:\n\n143/(20\u221a14) = 143\u221a14/(20*14) = 143\u221a14/280.\n\nSo, y = (3\u221a14/5) - (143\u221a14/280).\n\nConvert 3\u221a14/5 to 168\u221a14/280.\n\nSo, y = (168\u221a14 - 143\u221a14)/280 = (25\u221a14)/280 = 5\u221a14/56.\n\nSo, the circumcenter O is at (5, 5\u221a14/56).",

(2)\n\nSubtract equation (2) from equation (1):\n\n(x - 10)^2 + y^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = 25 - 81\nExpand (x -10)^2: x^2 - 20x + 100 + y^2 - x^2 - y^2 = -56\nSimplify: -20x + 100 = -56\n=> -20x = -156\n=> x = 156 / 20 = 39/5 = 7.8\n\nSo x = 39/5. Now plug back into equation (2) to find y:\n\n(39/5)^2 + y^2 = 81\nCompute (39/5)^2: 39^2 = 1521, 1521/25 = 60.84\n\nSo 60.84 + y^2 = 81\n=> y^2 = 81 - 60.84 = 20.16\nWhich is 2016/100 = 504/25. So y = sqrt(504/25) = (sqrt(504))/5.\n\nSimplify sqrt(504): 504 = 16 * 31.5, but wait, earlier we saw 504 = 7*8*9, so sqrt(504) = sqrt(7*8*9) = sqrt(7)*sqrt(8)*sqrt(9) = 3*2\u221a14 = 6\u221a14.

Then, I can compute coordinates of B, then find the equations of the tangents at B and C, find their intersection D, then find equation of line AD, find its intersection with the circle again at P, and then compute AP.\n\nThis might be a bit involved, but perhaps manageable.\n\nFirst, let's assign coordinates:\n\nLet\u2019s set point C at (0,0), point A at (10,0).

Since line AD passes through A(10,0), which is on the circle, x=10 is one solution. The other solution will be x-coordinate of P.\n\nSo, let me plug in x=10 into the equation.

Divide by 2: 89/10=8.9.\n\nSimilarly, 6\u221a14/5 divided by 2 is 3\u221a14/5.\n\nSo, M_AB=(89/10, 3\u221a14/5).\n\nSlope of AB: [6\u221a14/5 -0]/[39/5 -10] = [6\u221a14/5]/[39/5 -50/5] = [6\u221a14/5]/[-11/5] = -6\u221a14/11.\n\nSo, the perpendicular bisector of AB will have slope reciprocal and opposite: 11/(6\u221a14).\n\nSimilarly, compute the perpendicular bisector of AC.\n\nMidpoint of AC: A(10,0), C(0,0). Midpoint M_AC=(5,0).\n\nSlope of AC is (0-0)/(0-10)=0, so it's horizontal. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector is vertical, so its equation is x=5.\n\nSo, the perpendicular bisector of AC is x=5.\n\nNow, we can find the circumcenter O as the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC.\n\nWe have one perpendicular bisector as x=5. Now, we need the equation of the perpendicular bisector of AB.\n\nWe have the midpoint M_AB=(89/10, 3\u221a14/5) and the slope 11/(6\u221a14).\n\nSo, the equation is (y - 3\u221a14/5) = (11/(6\u221a14))(x - 89/10).\n\nNow, we can plug x=5 into this equation to find y-coordinate of O.\n\nSo, substituting x=5:\n\ny - 3\u221a14/5 = (11/(6\u221a14))(5 - 89/10).\n\nCompute 5 -89/10: 5 is 50/10, so 50/10 -89/10= -39/10.\n\nSo,\n\ny - 3\u221a14/5 = (11/(6\u221a14))*(-39/10) = (-429)/(60\u221a14) = (-143)/(20\u221a14).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14 to rationalize:\n\n(-143\u221a14)/(20*14) = (-143\u221a14)/(280).\n\nSo, y = 3\u221a14/5 + (-143\u221a14)/(280).\n\nConvert 3\u221a14/5 to denominator 280:\n\n3\u221a14/5 = (3\u221a14 *56)/(5*56) = 168\u221a14/280.\n\nSo,\n\ny = (168\u221a14 -143\u221a14)/280 = (25\u221a14)/280 = (5\u221a14)/56.\n\nSo, circumcenter O is at (5, 5\u221a14/56).",
          "text2": "Wait, but I don't know where O is. Hmm, maybe I can find O as the circumcenter of triangle ABC.\n\nYes, since ABC is inscribed in \u03c9, \u03c9 is the circumcircle, so O is the circumcenter.\n\nSo, let's compute the circumcenter O of triangle ABC. To find the circumcenter, I can find the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC.\n\nGiven points A(10,0), B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5), C(0,0). Let me compute the perpendicular bisectors.\n\nFirst, find the midpoint of AB. Midpoint M1: x = (10 + 39/5)/2, y = (0 + 6\u221a14/5)/2.\n\nCompute x: 10 is 50/5, so 50/5 + 39/5 = 89/5, divided by 2: 89/10 = 8.9.\n\ny: 6\u221a14/5 divided by 2 is 3\u221a14/5.\n\nNow, the slope of AB is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (6\u221a14/5 - 0)/(39/5 - 10) = (6\u221a14/5) / (-11/5) = -6\u221a14 /11.\n\nSo, the perpendicular bisector will have slope reciprocal and opposite: 11/(6\u221a14).\n\nSo, the equation of the perpendicular bisector of AB is: (y - 3\u221a14/5) = (11/(6\u221a14))(x - 89/10).\n\nSimilarly, find the perpendicular bisector of AC. Midpoint of AC: (5, 0), since AC is from (10,0) to (0,0). The midpoint is (5,0). The slope of AC is 0, since it's along the x-axis. So, the perpendicular bisector is vertical, x = 5.\n\nSo, O lies at the intersection of x=5 and the perpendicular bisector of AB.\n\nSo, plug x=5 into the equation of the perpendicular bisector of AB:\n\ny - 3\u221a14/5 = (11/(6\u221a14))(5 - 89/10).\n\nCompute 5 - 89/10: 5 is 50/10, so 50/10 - 89/10 = -39/10.\n\nSo, y - 3\u221a14/5 = (11/(6\u221a14))*(-39/10) = (-429)/(60\u221a14) = (-143)/(20\u221a14).\n\nSo, y = 3\u221a14/5 - 143/(20\u221a14).\n\nLet me rationalize the second term:\n\n143/(20\u221a14) = 143\u221a14/(20*14) = 143\u221a14/280.\n\nSo, y = (3\u221a14/5) - (143\u221a14/280).\n\nConvert 3\u221a14/5 to 168\u221a14/280.\n\nSo, y = (168\u221a14 - 143\u221a14)/280 = (25\u221a14)/280 = 5\u221a14/56.\n\nSo, the circumcenter O is at (5, 5\u221a14/56).",

We need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C.\n\nThe tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, and the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC.\n\nSo, let's find the equations of the tangents at B and C.\n\nBut first, let's compute vectors OB and OC.\n\nCenter O is at (5, 5\u221a14/56). Point B is at (39/5, 6\u221a14/5). So, vector OB is from O to B: (39/5 - 5, 6\u221a14/5 - 5\u221a14/56).\n\nCompute 39/5 -5 = 39/5 -25/5 = 14/5.\n\nCompute 6\u221a14/5 - 5\u221a14/56: Let me find a common denominator, which is 280.\n\n6\u221a14/5 = (6\u221a14 * 56)/280 = 336\u221a14/280.\n\n5\u221a14/56 = (5\u221a14 *5)/280 = 25\u221a14/280.\n\nSo, 336\u221a14/280 -25\u221a14/280 = 311\u221a14/280.\n\nSo, vector OB is (14/5, 311\u221a14/280).\n\nSimilarly, vector OC is from O to C: (0 -5, 0 -5\u221a14/56) = (-5, -5\u221a14/56).\n\nNow, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, so its slope is negative reciprocal of the slope of OB.\n\nSlope of OB: (311\u221a14/280)/(14/5) = (311\u221a14/280)*(5/14) )= (311\u221a14 *5)/(280*14) = (1555\u221a14)/(3920).\n\nSimplify: 1555/3920 = divide numerator and denominator by 5: 311/784.\n\nSo, slope of OB is (311\u221a14)/784. Therefore, the slope of the tangent at B is the negative reciprocal, which is -784/(311\u221a14) = -784\u221a14/(311*14) = -56\u221a14/311.\n\nSimilarly, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC. Let's find the slope of OC:\n\nVector OC is (-5, -5\u221a14/56). So, slope is (-5\u221a14/56)/(-5) = (\u221a14)/56.\n\nTherefore, the slope of tangent at C is the negative reciprocal: -56/\u221a14 = -56\u221a14/14 = -4\u221a14.\n\nSo, now, we have the equations of the two tangents.\n\nEquation of tangent at B: passes through B (39/5, 6\u221a14/5) with slope -56\u221a14/311.\n\nEquation: y - 6\u221a14/5 = (-56\u221a14/311)(x - 39/5).\n\nSimilarly, equation of tangent at C: passes through C (0,0) with slope -4\u221a14.\n\nEquation: y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\nNow, the point D is the intersection of these two tangents.

Simplify further by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: -15/22.\n\nSo, x= -15/22.\n\nNow, find y from tangent at C: y= -4\u221a14 x = -4\u221a14*(-15/22)= (60\u221a14)/22 = (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo, point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, we need to find point P, which is the intersection of AD with \u03c9, other than A.\n\nSo, we have point A at (10,0) and point D at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11). Let's find the parametric equation of line AD.\n\nParametrize AD with parameter t. Let point A be at t=0, and point D at t=1.\n\nSo, the parametric equations are:\n\nx(t) = 10 + t*(-15/22 -10) = 10 + t*(-235/22)\n\ny(t) = 0 + t*(30\u221a14/11 -0) = (30\u221a14/11)*t.\n\nSo, x(t) = 10 - (235/22)t\n\ny(t) = (30\u221a14/11) t\n\nWe need to find t such that (x(t), y(t)) lies on \u03c9.\n\nThe equation of \u03c9 is (x -5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nSo, plug x(t) and y(t) into this equation.\n\nFirst, compute (x(t) -5)^2:\n\nx(t) -5 = (10 -235t/22 -5) =5 -235t/22.\n\nSo, squared: (5 -235t/22)^2 = [ (110 -235t)/22 ]^2 = (110 -235t)^2 / (22)^2.\n\nSimilarly, (y(t) -5\u221a14/56)^2:\n\ny(t) -5\u221a14/56 = (30\u221a14/11)t -5\u221a14/56.\n\nFactor out \u221a14:\n\n\u221a14 [ (30/11)t -5/56 ].\n\nSo, squared: 14 * [ (30/11)t -5/56 ]^2.\n\nSo, putting it all into the circle equation:\n\n[(110 -235t)^2 / (22)^2] + [14 * ( (30/11)t -5/56 )^2 ] = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nCompute RHS:\n\n(75\u221a14/56)^2 = (75^2 *14)/(56^2) = (5625 *14)/(3136) = 78750 / 3136.\n\nSimplify:\n\n78750 \u00f7 14 = 5625, 3136 \u00f714=224.

Let's find the common denominator between 11 and 56, which is 616.\n\n30/11 = 30*56/616 = 1680/616.\n\n5/56 =5*11/616 =55/616.\n\nSo, (30/11)t -5/56 = (1680t -55)/616.\n\nSo, squared: (1680t -55)^2 / (616)^2.\n\nMultiply by 14:\n\n14*(1680t -55)^2 / (616)^2.\n\nSimplify denominator: 616^2 = (616)^2. 616 = 56*11. 56^2=3136, 11^2=121. So, 616^2=3136*121.\n\nSo, 14*(1680t -55)^2 / (3136*121) = (14)*(1680t -55)^2 / (3136*121).\n\nSimplify 14/3136 = 1/224.\n\nSo, second term becomes (1680t -55)^2 / (224*121).\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\n[12100 -51700t +55225t\u00b2]/484 + [ (1680t -55)^2 ]/(224*121) = 5625/224.\n\nNow, let me convert everything to the same denominator to solve for t.

Let me place point C at the origin (0,0), point A at (10,0), since AC=10. Then point B is somewhere in the plane such that AB=5 and BC=9.\n\nSo, coordinates of A: (10,0)\nCoordinates of C: (0,0)\nCoordinates of B: (x,y), which we need to find.\n\nGiven that AB=5, so distance from A to B is 5:\nsqrt[(x - 10)^2 + (y - 0)^2] = 5\n=> (x - 10)^2 + y^2 = 25. (1)\n\nAlso, BC=9, so distance from B to C is 9:\nsqrt[(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2] = 9\n=> x^2 + y^2 = 81.

So y = sqrt(504/25) = (sqrt(504))/5.\n\nSimplify sqrt(504): 504 = 16 * 31.5, but wait, earlier we saw 504 = 7*8*9, so sqrt(504) = sqrt(7*8*9) = sqrt(7)*sqrt(8)*sqrt(9) = 3*2\u221a14 = 6\u221a14.

Then, I can compute coordinates of B, then find the equations of the tangents at B and C, find their intersection D, then find equation of line AD, find its intersection with the circle again at P, and then compute AP.\n\nThis might be a bit involved, but perhaps manageable.\n\nFirst, let's assign coordinates:\n\nLet\u2019s set point C at (0,0), point A at (10,0).

Since line AD passes through A(10,0), which is on the circle, x=10 is one solution. The other solution will be x-coordinate of P.\n\nSo, let me plug in x=10 into the equation.

Then:\n\nDistance from B to C: \u221a(x^2 + y^2) =9 \u2192 x^2 + y^2 =81.\n\nDistance from B to A: \u221a[(x-10)^2 + y^2] =5 \u2192 (x-10)^2 + y^2=25.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\n(x-10)^2 + y^2 - (x^2 + y^2) =25 -81 \u2192 x\u00b2 -20x +100 + y\u00b2 -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = -56 \u2192 -20x +100 = -56 \u2192 -20x = -156 \u2192 x=156/20=7.8.\n\nSo, x=7.8, which is 78/10=39/5.\n\nThen, from x^2 + y^2=81:\n\n(39/5)^2 + y^2 =81 \u2192 (1521/25) + y^2=81 \u2192 y\u00b2=81 -1521/25.\n\nConvert 81 to 2025/25. So, y\u00b2=2025/25 -1521/25=504/25. So, y=\u221a(504)/5.\n\nSimplify \u221a504: as before, \u221a504=6\u221a14. So, y=6\u221a14/5.\n\nSo, coordinates of B: (39/5, 6\u221a14/5).\n\nSo, now I have coordinates for A(10,0), B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5), C(0,0).\n\nNow, point D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C.\n\nSo, I need to find the equations of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle \u03c9 of ABC, then find their intersection point D.\n\nBut to find the tangent lines, I might need to know the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9.",

So, the perpendicular bisector is vertical, x = 5.\n\nSo, O lies at the intersection of x=5 and the perpendicular bisector of AB.\n\nSo, plug x=5 into the equation of the perpendicular bisector of AB:\n\ny - 3\u221a14/5 = (11/(6\u221a14))(5 - 89/10).\n\nCompute 5 - 89/10: 5 is 50/10, so 50/10 - 89/10 = -39/10.\n\nSo, y - 3\u221a14/5 = (11/(6\u221a14))*(-39/10) = (-429)/(60\u221a14) = (-143)/(20\u221a14).\n\nSo, y = 3\u221a14/5 - 143/(20\u221a14).\n\nLet me rationalize the second term:\n\n143/(20\u221a14) = 143\u221a14/(20*14) = 143\u221a14/280.\n\nSo, y = (3\u221a14/5) - (143\u221a14/280).\n\nConvert 3\u221a14/5 to 168\u221a14/280.\n\nSo, y = (168\u221a14 - 143\u221a14)/280 = (25\u221a14)/280 = 5\u221a14/56.\n\nSo, the circumcenter O is at (5, 5\u221a14/56).",

Point B is at (39/5, 6\u221a14/5). So, vector OB is from O to B: (39/5 - 5, 6\u221a14/5 - 5\u221a14/56).\n\nCompute 39/5 -5 = 39/5 -25/5 = 14/5.\n\nCompute 6\u221a14/5 - 5\u221a14/56: Let me find a common denominator, which is 280.\n\n6\u221a14/5 = (6\u221a14 * 56)/280 = 336\u221a14/280.\n\n5\u221a14/56 = (5\u221a14 *5)/280 = 25\u221a14/280.\n\nSo, 336\u221a14/280 -25\u221a14/280 = 311\u221a14/280.\n\nSo, vector OB is (14/5, 311\u221a14/280).\n\nSimilarly, vector OC is from O to C: (0 -5, 0 -5\u221a14/56) = (-5, -5\u221a14/56).\n\nNow, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, so its slope is negative reciprocal of the slope of OB.\n\nSlope of OB: (311\u221a14/280)/(14/5) = (311\u221a14/280)*(5/14) )= (311\u221a14 *5)/(280*14) = (1555\u221a14)/(3920).\n\nSimplify: 1555/3920 = divide numerator and denominator by 5: 311/784.\n\nSo, slope of OB is (311\u221a14)/784.

Let's find the parametric equation of line AD.\n\nParametrize AD with parameter t.

So, 5625/224.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n[(110 -235t)^2]/(484) + [14*( (30/11)t -5/56 )^2 ] = 5625/224.\n\nNow, let's compute each term.\n\nFirst term:\n\n(110 -235t)^2 = (110)^2 - 2*110*235 t + (235t)^2 = 12100 - 51700t + 55225t\u00b2.\n\nDivided by 484: [12100 -51700t +55225t\u00b2]/484.\n\nSecond term:\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n(30/11)t -5/56.\n\nLet me write it with a common denominator.

So, 280*14=56*5*14=56*70=3920.\n\nNumerator: \u221a14 *311*5 = 1555\u221a14.\n\nSo, slope of OB is (1555\u221a14)/3920.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator by 5: numerator=311\u221a14, denominator=784.\n\nSo, slope of radius OB is (311\u221a14)/784.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the tangent at B is the negative reciprocal of that.\n\nSo, slope of tangent at B: m_B = -784/(311\u221a14).\n\nRationalize the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14.\n\nm_B = -784\u221a14 / (311*14) = -784\u221a14 / 4354.\n\nSimplify 784 and 4354: Let's see, 784 divides by 16: 784/16=49. 4354/16=272.125, which is not integer. Let me check GCD of 784 and 4354.\n\nCompute GCD(784,4354):\n\n4354 \u00f7784=5, remainder 4354 -5*784=4354-3920=434.\n\nThen GCD(784,434).\n\n784 \u00f7434=1, remainder 350.\n\n434 \u00f7350=1, remainder 84.\n\n350 \u00f784=4, remainder 14.\n\n84 \u00f714=6, remainder 0. So GCD is14.\n\nSo, 784/14=56, 4354/14=311.\n\nSo, m_B= -56\u221a14 / 311.\n\nSimilarly, compute the slope of the tangent at C.\n\nPoint C is at (0,0). The center is at (5,5\u221a14/56).\n\nSo, the radius OC has slope (0 -5\u221a14/56)/(0 -5)= (-5\u221a14/56)/(-5)= (\u221a14)/56.\n\nSo, slope of OC is \u221a14/56.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the tangent at C is the negative reciprocal: m_C= -56/\u221a14.\n\nRationalize: -56\u221a14 /14= -4\u221a14.\n\nSo, the tangent at C has slope -4\u221a14.\n\nNow, we have two tangent lines: at B with slope m_B= -56\u221a14 / 311, passing through B(39/5,6\u221a14/5).\n\nAnd tangent at C with slope m_C= -4\u221a14, passing through C(0,0).\n\nWe need to find their intersection point D.\n\nFirst, let me write the equations of these two tangents.\n\nEquation of tangent at B:\n\nUsing point-slope form: y - y_B = m_B (x - x_B).\n\nSo, y - (6\u221a14/5) = (-56\u221a14 /311)(x - 39/5).\n\nEquation of tangent at C:\n\nSlope is -4\u221a14, passes through (0,0), so equation is y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\nSo, now we have two equations:\n\n1. y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\n2. y = (-56\u221a14 /311)(x - 39/5) + 6\u221a14/5.\n\nWe need to solve for x and y to find point D.\n\nLet me set equation 1 into equation 2.\n\nSo, substitute y from equation 1 into equation 2:\n\n-4\u221a14 x = (-56\u221a14 /311)(x - 39/5) + 6\u221a14/5.\n\nLet me divide both sides by \u221a14 to simplify:\n\n-4x = (-56/311)(x - 39/5) + 6/5.\n\nMultiply through:\n\n-4x = (-56/311)x + (56/311)*(39/5) + 6/5.\n\nCompute (56/311)*(39/5):\n\n56*39=2184, so 2184/(311*5)=2184/1555.\n\nSimilarly, 6/5 is 6/5.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n-4x = (-56/311)x + 2184/1555 + 6/5.\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n-4x + (56/311)x = 2184/1555 + 6/5.\n\nCompute the coefficients:\n\nConvert -4x to (-1244/311)x because 4*311=1244.\n\nSo, (-1244/311 + 56/311) x = 2184/1555 + 6/5.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(-1244 +56)/311 x = (2184 + 6*311)/1555.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n-1244 +56 = -1188.\n\nSo, (-1188/311)x = (2184 + 1866)/1555.\n\nCompute numerator on right:\n\n2184 + 1866= 4050.\n\nSo, equation is (-1188/311)x= 4050/1555.\n\nSimplify 4050/1555:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: 810/311.\n\nSo, (-1188/311)x = 810/311.\n\nMultiply both sides by 311:\n\n-1188x = 810.\n\nThus, x= 810/(-1188)= -810/1188.\n\nSimplify: divide numerator and denominator by 9: -90/132.\n\nAgain divide by 6: -15/22.\n\nSo, x= -15/22.\n\nThen, y= -4\u221a14 x= -4\u221a14*(-15/22)= (60\u221a14)/22= (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo, point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, we need to find point P, which is the second intersection of line AD with the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nSo, line AD goes from A(10,0) to D(-15/22, 30\u221a14/11). We can parametrize this line and find where it intersects the circle \u03c9 again.\n\nFirst, find the parametric equations for AD.\n\nLet me express line AD in parametric form.\n\nLet t be a parameter, with t=0 at A(10,0) and t=1 at D(-15/22,30\u221a14/11).\n\nSo, the direction vector from A to D is:\n\n\u0394x = (-15/22 -10) = (-15/22 -220/22)= (-235/22).\n\n\u0394y= (30\u221a14/11 -0)= 30\u221a14/11.\n\nSo, parametric equations:\n\nx = 10 + t*(-235/22).\n\ny = 0 + t*(30\u221a14/11).\n\nWe can write:\n\nx = 10 - (235/22) t.\n\ny = (30\u221a14/11) t.\n\nNow, we need to find the point P where this line intersects \u03c9 again. So, plug x and y into the circle equation and solve for t.\n\nThe circle \u03c9 has equation (x -5)^2 + (y - 5\u221a14/56)^2 = 5625/224.\n\nPlug in x and y:\n\n[10 - (235/22) t -5]^2 + [ (30\u221a14/11) t - 5\u221a14/56 ]^2 = 5625/224.\n\nSimplify each term.\n\nFirst term: [5 - (235/22) t]^2.\n\nSecond term: [ (30\u221a14/11) t - 5\u221a14/56 ]^2.\n\nLet me compute each part.\n\nFirst term: 5 - (235/22) t.\n\nSquare: [5 - (235/22) t]^2 = 25 - 2*5*(235/22) t + (235/22)^2 t\u00b2.\n\nCalculate coefficients:\n\n2*5*(235/22)= 10*(235/22)= 2350/22= 1175/11.\n\n(235/22)^2= (235)^2 / (22)^2 = 55225/484.\n\nSo, first term squared is 25 - (1175/11) t + (55225/484) t\u00b2.\n\nSecond term: [ (30\u221a14/11) t - 5\u221a14/56 ]^2.\n\nFactor out \u221a14:\n\n\u221a14 [ (30/11) t - 5/56 ].\n\nSquare: 14 * [ (30/11 t -5/56) ]^2.\n\nCompute inside the square:\n\n(30/11)t -5/56.\n\nFind common denominator for 11 and 56, which is 616.\n\n30/11 = (30*56)/616= 1680/616.\n\n5/56=55/616.\n\nSo, 1680/616 t -55/616 = (1680 t -55)/616.\n\nSo, inside the square: (1680 t -55)/616.\n\nThus, the second term squared is 14 * [ (1680 t -55)^2 ] / (616)^2.\n\nCompute (1680t -55)^2= (1680t)^2 - 2*1680t*55 +55^2= 2822400 t\u00b2 - 184800 t + 3025.\n\nDenominator: 616^2=379456.\n\nSo, second term squared is 14*(2822400 t\u00b2 -184800 t +3025)/379456.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n14*(2822400 t\u00b2 -184800 t +3025) = 39513600 t\u00b2 -2587200 t +42350.\n\nDenominator: 379456.\n\nSo, second term squared is (39513600 t\u00b2 -2587200 t +42350)/379456.\n\nNow, sum first term squared and second term squared:\n\nFirst term squared: 25 - (1175/11) t + (55225/484) t\u00b2.\n\nSecond term squared: (39513600 t\u00b2 -2587200 t +42350)/379456.\n\nSo, sum:\n\n25 - (1175/11)t + (55225/484)t\u00b2 + (39513600 t\u00b2 -2587200 t +42350)/379456 = 5625/224.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps we can find a common denominator or proceed step by step.",

So, slope is -112\u221a14 /622.\n\nSimplify further: 112 and 622 can both be divided by 2. 112/2=56, 622/2=311.\n\nSo, slope= -56\u221a14 /311.\n\nSo, the tangent at B has slope -56\u221a14 /311.\n\nSimilarly, earlier, the tangent at C has slope -4\u221a14.\n\nNow, let's write the equations of these two tangents.\n\nFirst, tangent at C: passes through C(0,0), slope -4\u221a14.\n\nEquation: y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\nSecond, tangent at B: passes through B(39/5,6\u221a14/5), slope -56\u221a14 /311.\n\nEquation: y -6\u221a14/5 = (-56\u221a14/311)(x -39/5).\n\nSo, now, we need to find point D, which is the intersection of these two tangents.\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1. y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\n2. y = (-56\u221a14/311)(x -39/5) + 6\u221a14/5.\n\nSo, substitute equation 1 into equation 2.\n\n-4\u221a14 x = (-56\u221a14/311)(x -39/5) + 6\u221a14/5.\n\nLet me divide both sides by \u221a14 to simplify:\n\n-4x = (-56/311)(x -39/5) +6/5.\n\nMultiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-4x *311 = -56(x -39/5) +6/5 *311.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nLeft: -1244x.\n\nRight: -56x + (56*39)/5 + (6*311)/5.\n\nCompute 56*39: 56*40=2240, minus 56=2184. So, 2184/5.\n\n6*311=1866. 1866/5.\n\nSo, right side: -56x + (2184 +1866)/5 = -56x + 4050/5= -56x +810.\n\nSo, equation:\n\n-1244x = -56x +810.\n\nBring -56x to left:\n\n-1244x +56x=810 \u2192 (-1188x)=810.\n\nSo, x=810/(-1188)= -810/1188.\n\nSimplify: Divide numerator and denominator by 9: 810 \u00f79=90, 1188 \u00f79=132.\n\nSo, x= -90/132= -15/22.\n\nSo, x= -15/22.\n\nThen, y= -4\u221a14 x= -4\u221a14*(-15/22)=60\u221a14/22=30\u221a14/11.\n\nSo, point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, we have point D at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11), and point A at (10,0).

Let me compute that:\n\n25 is 25*224/224 = 5600/224. So, 5600/224 + 25/224 = 5625/224.\n\nSo, OA = sqrt(5625/224) = 75/sqrt(224). Simplify sqrt(224): sqrt(16*14) = 4\u221a14. So, OA = 75/(4\u221a14) = (75\u221a14)/(4*14) = (75\u221a14)/56.\n\nSo, the radius R is 75\u221a14/56.\n\nNow, back to the problem. We need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C.\n\nThe tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, and the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC.\n\nSo, let's find the equations of the tangents at B and C.\n\nBut first, let's compute vectors OB and OC.\n\nCenter O is at (5, 5\u221a14/56). Point B is at (39/5, 6\u221a14/5). So, vector OB is from O to B: (39/5 - 5, 6\u221a14/5 - 5\u221a14/56).\n\nCompute 39/5 -5 = 39/5 -25/5 = 14/5.\n\nCompute 6\u221a14/5 - 5\u221a14/56: Let me find a common denominator, which is 280.\n\n6\u221a14/5 = (6\u221a14 * 56)/280 = 336\u221a14/280.\n\n5\u221a14/56 = (5\u221a14 *5)/280 = 25\u221a14/280.\n\nSo, 336\u221a14/280 -25\u221a14/280 = 311\u221a14/280.\n\nSo, vector OB is (14/5, 311\u221a14/280).\n\nSimilarly, vector OC is from O to C: (0 -5, 0 -5\u221a14/56) = (-5, -5\u221a14/56).\n\nNow, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, so its slope is negative reciprocal of the slope of OB.\n\nSlope of OB: (311\u221a14/280)/(14/5) = (311\u221a14/280)*(5/14) )= (311\u221a14 *5)/(280*14) = (1555\u221a14)/(3920).\n\nSimplify: 1555/3920 = divide numerator and denominator by 5: 311/784.\n\nSo, slope of OB is (311\u221a14)/784. Therefore, the slope of the tangent at B is the negative reciprocal, which is -784/(311\u221a14) = -784\u221a14/(311*14) = -56\u221a14/311.\n\nSimilarly, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC. Let's find the slope of OC:\n\nVector OC is (-5, -5\u221a14/56). So, slope is (-5\u221a14/56)/(-5) = (\u221a14)/56.\n\nTherefore, the slope of tangent at C is the negative reciprocal: -56/\u221a14 = -56\u221a14/14 = -4\u221a14.\n\nSo, now, we have the equations of the two tangents.\n\nEquation of tangent at B: passes through B (39/5, 6\u221a14/5) with slope -56\u221a14/311.\n\nEquation: y - 6\u221a14/5 = (-56\u221a14/311)(x - 39/5).\n\nSimilarly, equation of tangent at C: passes through C (0,0) with slope -4\u221a14.\n\nEquation: y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\nNow, the point D is the intersection of these two tangents. Let's solve for D.\n\nFrom tangent at C: y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\nSubstitute into tangent at B's equation:\n\n-4\u221a14 x - 6\u221a14/5 = (-56\u221a14/311)(x - 39/5).\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n-4\u221a14 x - (6\u221a14)/5 = (-56\u221a14/311)(x - 39/5).\n\nWe can factor out \u221a14:\n\n\u221a14 [ -4x - 6/5 ] = \u221a14 [ (-56/311)(x - 39/5) ].\n\nDivide both sides by \u221a14:\n\n-4x - 6/5 = (-56/311)(x - 39/5).\n\nNow, let me multiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-4x*311 - (6/5)*311 = -56(x - 39/5).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-4*311 = -1244, so left term is -1244x.\n\n- (6/5)*311 = - (6*311)/5 = -1866/5.\n\nRight side: -56x + (56*39)/5 = -56x + 2184/5.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n-1244x - 1866/5 = -56x + 2184/5.\n\nLet's bring all terms to left:\n\n-1244x +56x -1866/5 -2184/5 =0\n\nCompute:\n\n-1188x - (1866 +2184)/5 =0 \u2192 -1188x -4050/5=0 \u2192 -1188x -810=0 \u2192 -1188x=810 \u2192 x= -810/1188.\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 18: 810 \u00f718=45, 1188 \u00f718=66.\n\nx= -45/66. Simplify further by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: -15/22.\n\nSo, x= -15/22.\n\nNow, find y from tangent at C: y= -4\u221a14 x = -4\u221a14*(-15/22)= (60\u221a14)/22 = (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo, point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, we need to find point P, which is the intersection of AD with \u03c9, other than A.\n\nSo, we have point A at (10,0) and point D at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11). Let's find the parametric equation of line AD.\n\nParametrize AD with parameter t. Let point A be at t=0, and point D at t=1.\n\nSo, the parametric equations are:\n\nx(t) = 10 + t*(-15/22 -10) = 10 + t*(-235/22)\n\ny(t) = 0 + t*(30\u221a14/11 -0) = (30\u221a14/11)*t.\n\nSo, x(t) = 10 - (235/22)t\n\ny(t) = (30\u221a14/11) t\n\nWe need to find t such that (x(t), y(t)) lies on \u03c9.\n\nThe equation of \u03c9 is (x -5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nSo, plug x(t) and y(t) into this equation.\n\nFirst, compute (x(t) -5)^2:\n\nx(t) -5 = (10 -235t/22 -5) =5 -235t/22.\n\nSo, squared: (5 -235t/22)^2 = [ (110 -235t)/22 ]^2 = (110 -235t)^2 / (22)^2.\n\nSimilarly, (y(t) -5\u221a14/56)^2:\n\ny(t) -5\u221a14/56 = (30\u221a14/11)t -5\u221a14/56.\n\nFactor out \u221a14:\n\n\u221a14 [ (30/11)t -5/56 ].\n\nSo, squared: 14 * [ (30/11)t -5/56 ]^2.\n\nSo, putting it all into the circle equation:\n\n[(110 -235t)^2 / (22)^2] + [14 * ( (30/11)t -5/56 )^2 ] = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nCompute RHS:\n\n(75\u221a14/56)^2 = (75^2 *14)/(56^2) = (5625 *14)/(3136) = 78750 / 3136.\n\nSimplify:\n\n78750 \u00f7 14 = 5625, 3136 \u00f714=224. So, 5625/224.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n[(110 -235t)^2]/(484) + [14*( (30/11)t -5/56 )^2 ] = 5625/224.\n\nNow, let's compute each term.\n\nFirst term:\n\n(110 -235t)^2 = (110)^2 - 2*110*235 t + (235t)^2 = 12100 - 51700t + 55225t\u00b2.\n\nDivided by 484: [12100 -51700t +55225t\u00b2]/484.\n\nSecond term:\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n(30/11)t -5/56.\n\nLet me write it with a common denominator. Let's find the common denominator between 11 and 56, which is 616.\n\n30/11 = 30*56/616 = 1680/616.\n\n5/56 =5*11/616 =55/616.\n\nSo, (30/11)t -5/56 = (1680t -55)/616.\n\nSo, squared: (1680t -55)^2 / (616)^2.\n\nMultiply by 14:\n\n14*(1680t -55)^2 / (616)^2.\n\nSimplify denominator: 616^2 = (616)^2. 616 = 56*11. 56^2=3136, 11^2=121. So, 616^2=3136*121.\n\nSo, 14*(1680t -55)^2 / (3136*121) = (14)*(1680t -55)^2 / (3136*121).\n\nSimplify 14/3136 = 1/224.\n\nSo, second term becomes (1680t -55)^2 / (224*121).\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\n[12100 -51700t +55225t\u00b2]/484 + [ (1680t -55)^2 ]/(224*121) = 5625/224.\n\nNow, let me convert everything to the same denominator to solve for t. The denominators are 484, 224*121, and 224.\n\nCompute denominators:\n\n484 = 22^2 = 4*121.\n\n224*121 = 224*121.\n\n224 is 32*7, but maybe it's better to express all in terms of 121 and 224.\n\nBut to find a common denominator, let's compute LCM of 484 and 224*121.\n\n484 = 4*121.\n\n224*121 = 224*121.\n\nSo, LCM is 4*121*224 / GCD(4, 224).",

The tangent at a point (x1, y1) on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0 is:\n\nxx1 + yy1 + (D(x +x1))/2 + (E(y + y1))/2 + F =0.\n\nIn our case, F=0, so the equation is:\n\nx*x1 + y*y1 + (D(x +x1))/2 + (E(y + y1))/2 =0.\n\nGiven that, for point B(39/5, 6\u221a14 /5), the tangent at B is:\n\nx*(39/5) + y*(6\u221a14 /5) + (-10)(x +39/5)/2 + (-5\u221a14 /28)(y +6\u221a14 /5)/2 =0\n\nHmm, this looks a bit messy, but let's compute step by step.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (39/5)x + (6\u221a14 /5)y\n\nSecond term: (-10/2)(x + 39/5) = (-5)(x + 39/5) = -5x -39\n\nThird term: (-5\u221a14 /28 /2)(y +6\u221a14 /5) = (-5\u221a14 /56)(y +6\u221a14 /5) = (-5\u221a14 /56)y - (5\u221a14 *6\u221a14)/(56*5)\n\nSimplify the third term:\n\n(-5\u221a14 /56)y - (5*6*14)/(56*5) \u2192 because sqrt14 * sqrt14 is 14.\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe second part: (5*6*14) = 420; denominator is 56*5=280.\n\nSo, -420/280 = -1.5 = -3/2.",

Maybe assign coordinates to points A, B, C, then find the circumcircle, find the tangents at B and C, find their intersection D, then find the equation of line AD, find its intersection P with the circle \u03c9, and compute AP.\n\nThis seems computational, but perhaps manageable.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, assign coordinates. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0), point A at (10,0), since AC=10. Then point B is somewhere in the plane such that AB=5 and BC=9.\n\nSo, coordinates of A: (10,0)\nCoordinates of C: (0,0)\nCoordinates of B: (x,y), which we need to find.\n\nGiven that AB=5, so distance from A to B is 5:\nsqrt[(x - 10)^2 + (y - 0)^2] = 5\n=> (x - 10)^2 + y^2 = 25. (1)\n\nAlso, BC=9, so distance from B to C is 9:\nsqrt[(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2] = 9\n=> x^2 + y^2 = 81.

Now plug back into equation (2) to find y:\n\n(39/5)^2 + y^2 = 81\nCompute (39/5)^2: 39^2 = 1521, 1521/25 = 60.84\n\nSo 60.84 + y^2 = 81\n=> y^2 = 81 - 60.84 = 20.16\nWhich is 2016/100 = 504/25. So y = sqrt(504/25) = (sqrt(504))/5.\n\nSimplify sqrt(504): 504 = 16 * 31.5, but wait, earlier we saw 504 = 7*8*9, so sqrt(504) = sqrt(7*8*9) = sqrt(7)*sqrt(8)*sqrt(9) = 3*2\u221a14 = 6\u221a14. So sqrt(504) = 6\u221a14, so y = (6\u221a14)/5.\n\nSo coordinates of B are (39/5, 6\u221a14/5).\n\nSo points:\n\nA: (10,0)\nB: (39/5, 6\u221a14/5)\nC: (0,0)\n\nNow, find the circumcircle \u03c9 of triangle ABC.\n\nThe circumcircle can be found by finding the perpendicular bisectors of two sides and finding their intersection, which is the circumcenter O.\n\nLet me compute the perpendicular bisector of AB and AC, or maybe AB and BC.",

Let me convert 6/5 to denominator 1555: 6/5= (6*311)/(5*311)=1866/1555.\n\nSo,\n\n2184/1555 +1866/1555= (2184+1866)/1555=4050/1555.\n\nSimplify 4050/1555: Divide numerator and denominator by 5: 810/311.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(1188/311)x +810/311=0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 311:\n\n1188x +810=0 \u2192 1188x = -810.\n\nSo, x= -810/1188.\n\nSimplify: Divide numerator and denominator by 18: 810 \u00f718=45, 1188 \u00f718=66.\n\nSo, x= -45/66= -15/22.\n\nSo, x= -15/22.\n\nNow, find y from tangent at C: y= -4\u221a14 x= -4\u221a14*(-15/22)=60\u221a14/22=30\u221a14/11.\n\nSo, point D has coordinates (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, we need to find point A(10,0), point D(-15/22, 30\u221a14/11). Let's find the equation of line AD.\n\nCompute the slope of AD:\n\nm=( y_D - y_A )/(x_D -x_A )= (30\u221a14/11 -0)/( -15/22 -10 )= (30\u221a14/11)/( (-15/22 -220/22 ))= (30\u221a14/11)/( -235/22 )= (30\u221a14/11)*( -22/235 )= (-60\u221a14)/235= (-12\u221a14)/47.\n\nSimplify: -12\u221a14/47.\n\nSo, the equation of AD is:\n\ny -0 = (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nSo, y= (-12\u221a14/47)x +120\u221a14/47.\n\nNow, we need to find point P where AD intersects the circumcircle \u03c9 again. Since A is already on \u03c9, P is the other intersection point.\n\nWe can parametrize AD and find its other intersection with \u03c9.",
          "text2": "Wait, denominator is -5, numerator is -5\u221a14/56.\n\nSo, slope is (-5\u221a14/56)/(-5)= (5\u221a14/56)/5= \u221a14/56.\n\nSo, slope of OC is \u221a14/56.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC. So, its slope is the negative reciprocal of \u221a14/56, which is -56/\u221a14= -56/(\u221a14)= -4\u221a14 (since \u221a14*4=\u221a14*(4)= 4\u221a14, so 56/\u221a14= (56\u221a14)/14=4\u221a14).\n\nSo, slope of tangent at C is -4\u221a14.\n\nSimilarly, for tangent at B.\n\nSlope of OB: from O(5,5\u221a14/56) to B(39/5,6\u221a14/5).
