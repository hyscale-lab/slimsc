Let me compute the actual angle.\n\nThe line from vertex 0 (1,0) to vertex 1 (cos30\u00b0, sin30\u00b0) is going from (1,0) to approximately (0.866, 0.5). The slope is (0.5 - 0)/(0.866 - 1) \u2248 0.5 / (-0.134) \u2248 -3.732. So the angle \u03b8 satisfies tan\u03b8 = -3.732. Since the line is going from right to left upwards, \u03b8 is in the second quadrant. So, the angle with the positive x-axis is 180\u00b0 - 75\u00b0 = 105\u00b0, because tan(75\u00b0) \u2248 3.732.",

But I don't know if that's directly relevant here.\n\nBut back to the problem. I need to find rectangles. So, a rectangle has four sides and four right angles. In a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can form various angles. However, the key here is that the sides of the rectangle must lie on the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, each side of the rectangle must be either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. \n\nBut how do these sides form a rectangle? Well, in a regular polygon, especially with 12 sides, there are multiple axes of symmetry, which can help in forming rectangles. A dodecagon has 12 lines of symmetry, each passing through a vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side. \n\nTo form a rectangle, we need two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular dodecagon, sides that are separated by a certain number of steps are parallel. For example, in a regular polygon, sides that are k steps apart are parallel. So, in a dodecagon, if I pick two sides that are k steps apart, they are parallel, and similarly for diagonals. So, for a rectangle, we need two pairs of such parallel sides.",

Let me try to list them:\n\nThe diameters are at angles 0\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 150\u00b0, 180\u00b0, etc., but since 180\u00b0 is the same as 0\u00b0, etc.\n\nSo, the diameters are at 0\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 150\u00b0.\n\nNow, the perpendicular diameters would be those that are 90\u00b0 apart. So, for each diameter, the perpendicular one is 3 steps away (since 3*30\u00b0=90\u00b0).\n\nSo, the pairs are:\n\n- 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0\n- 30\u00b0 and 120\u00b0\n- 60\u00b0 and 150\u00b0\n\nThat's three pairs.
