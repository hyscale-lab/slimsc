          "text1": "Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Suppose we have 4 numbers chosen by Jen. The total set S is 10 numbers. So, the lottery picks 4 numbers. Let me denote the number of overlapping numbers between Jen's numbers and the lottery numbers as k.\n\nSo, for exactly k matches, we need to choose k numbers from Jen's 4, and 4 - k numbers from the remaining 6 numbers in S that Jen didn't pick. So, the number of favorable outcomes for exactly k matches is C(4,k) * C(6,4 - k). \n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes for each case is:\n\n- Exactly 2 matches: C(4,2) * C(6,2)\n- Exactly 3 matches: C(4,3) * C(6,1)\n- Exactly 4 matches: C(4,4) * C(6,0)\n\nCalculating each:\n\n1. Exactly 2 matches: C(4,2) = 6, and C(6,2) = 15. So, 6 * 15 = 90.\n2. Exactly 3 matches: C(4,3) = 4, C(6,1) = 6. So, 4 * 6 = 24.\n3. Exactly 4 matches: C(4,4) = 1, C(6,0) = 1. So, 1 * 1 = 1.\n\nAdding these up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. So, the number of favorable outcomes for winning a prize is 115.\n\nTherefore, P(B) = 115 / 210. Let me simplify that fraction.

Since Jen has 4 numbers, there are 10 - 4 = 6 numbers she didn't pick. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from those 6 is C(6,4).\n\nC(6,4) = 15. So, number of ways is 15. Therefore, P(0 matches) = 15 / 210 = 1/14.\n\nNext, P(1 match): the number of ways to choose exactly 1 of Jen's 4 numbers and 3 from the remaining 6. So, the number of ways is C(4,1) * C(6,3).\n\nC(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, 4 * 20 = 80. Therefore, P(1 match) = 80 / 210. Simplifying that, 80/210 = 8/21.",

Since Jen has 4 numbers, there are 10 - 4 = 6 numbers not chosen by her. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the 6 not chosen is C(6,4).

Since Jen has 4 numbers, there are 10 - 4 = 6 numbers not chosen by her. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the 6 not chosen is C(6,4). Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is C(6,4) = 15. So, P(zero matches) = 15 / 210 = 1/14.\n\nNext, P(exactly one match): the number of ways to choose 4 numbers where exactly one is from Jen's 4 numbers and the remaining 3 are from the other 6. So, the number of favorable outcomes is C(4,1) * C(6,3). C(4,1) is 4 and C(6,3) is 20. So, 4 * 20 = 80.

Let me denote the number of overlapping numbers between Jen's numbers and the lottery numbers as k.\n\nSo, for exactly k matches, we need to choose k numbers from Jen's 4, and 4 - k numbers from the remaining 6 numbers in S that Jen didn't pick. So, the number of favorable outcomes for exactly k matches is C(4,k) * C(6,4 - k). \n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes for each case is:\n\n- Exactly 2 matches: C(4,2) * C(6,2)\n- Exactly 3 matches: C(4,3) * C(6,1)\n- Exactly 4 matches: C(4,4) * C(6,0)\n\nCalculating each:\n\n1. Exactly 2 matches: C(4,2) = 6, and C(6,2) = 15. So, 6 * 15 = 90.\n2. Exactly 3 matches: C(4,3) = 4, C(6,1) = 6. So, 4 * 6 = 24.\n3. Exactly 4 matches: C(4,4) = 1, C(6,0) = 1.

Since Jen has 4 numbers, there are 10 - 4 = 6 numbers not chosen by her. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the 6 not chosen is C(6,4).

So, the number of favorable outcomes for exactly k matches is C(4,k) * C(6,4 - k). \n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes for each case is:\n\n- Exactly 2 matches: C(4,2) * C(6,2)\n- Exactly 3 matches: C(4,3) * C(6,1)\n- Exactly 4 matches: C(4,4) * C(6,0)\n\nCalculating each:\n\n1. Exactly 2 matches: C(4,2) = 6, and C(6,2) = 15. So, 6 * 15 = 90.\n2. Exactly 3 matches: C(4,3) = 4, C(6,1) = 6. So, 4 * 6 = 24.\n3. Exactly 4 matches: C(4,4) = 1, C(6,0) = 1.

Since Jen has 4 numbers, there are 10 - 4 = 6 numbers not chosen by her. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the 6 not chosen is C(6,4). Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is C(6,4) = 15.

So, the number of favorable outcomes is C(4,1) * C(6,3). C(4,1) is 4 and C(6,3) is 20. So, 4 * 20 = 80.

The complement of \"at least two\" is \"zero or one match.\" So, P(B) = 1 - P(zero matches) - P(exactly one match).\n\nLet's compute P(zero matches) and P(exactly one match).\n\nFirst, P(zero matches): the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from S such that none of them are in Jen's 4 numbers. Since Jen has 4 numbers, there are 10 - 4 = 6 numbers not chosen by her. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the 6 not chosen is C(6,4). Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is C(6,4) = 15. So, P(zero matches) = 15 / 210 = 1/14.\n\nNext, P(exactly one match): the number of ways to choose 4 numbers where exactly one is from Jen's 4 numbers and the remaining 3 are from the other 6. So, the number of favorable outcomes is C(4,1) * C(6,3). C(4,1) is 4 and C(6,3) is 20. So, 4 * 20 = 80. Therefore, P(exactly one match) = 80 / 210.\n\nSimplify that: 80 divided by 210 is 8/21.\n\nSo, now we can compute P(B) as 1 - P(zero) - P(one) = 1 - (15/210) - (80/210).\n\nLet me compute that in terms of 210 denominator:\n\n1 = 210/210.\n\nSo, 210/210 - 15/210 - 80/210 = (210 - 15 - 80)/210 = (115)/210.\n\nSimplify 115/210: divide numerator and denominator by 5: 23/42. So, P(B) = 23/42.",
          "text2": "Alternatively, it might be easier to compute the complementary probability and subtract it from 1.\n\nThe complementary event of B is that fewer than two numbers are chosen, i.e., zero or one of her numbers are selected. So, P(B) = 1 - [P(zero matches) + P(exactly one match)].\n\nLet me compute P(zero matches): This is the number of ways to choose 4 numbers none of which are Jen's. Since Jen has 4 numbers, there are 10 - 4 = 6 numbers she didn't choose. So, the number of ways is C(6,4). Therefore, P(zero matches) = C(6,4) / C(10,4).\n\nSimilarly, P(exactly one match): This is the number of ways to choose 1 number from Jen's 4 and 3 numbers from the remaining 6. So, it's C(4,1)*C(6,3). Therefore, P(exactly one match) = [C(4,1)*C(6,3)] / C(10,4).\n\nLet me compute these values numerically.\n\nFirst, compute C(10,4): 10! / (4! * 6!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210.
