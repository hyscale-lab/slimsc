So, walking time is (2.4 - t/60) hours.\n\nWalking time is also 9 / (s + 2) hours.\n\nSo, equation 2: 9 / (s + 2) = 2.4 - (t / 60)\n\nNow I have two equations:\n\n1) 9/s = 4 - (t/60)\n2) 9/(s+2) = 2.4 - (t/60)\n\nI can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate t.",

So, let me denote:\n\nTotal time1 = Walking time1 + t = 4 hours.\n\nSimilarly, Total time2 = Walking time2 + t = 2.4 hours.\n\nSo, the walking time can be calculated by distance divided by speed. So, walking time1 = 9 / s hours.\n\nSimilarly, walking time2 = 9 / (s + 2) hours.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\n9/s + t = 4  --> equation 1\n\n9/(s + 2) + t = 2.4 --> equation 2\n\nHmm, okay. Now I have two equations with two variables, s and t.

Now, I can write this as:\n\n9 [1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 1.6\n\nLet me compute 1/s - 1/(s + 2). That's equal to [ (s + 2) - s ] / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)].\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\n9 * [2 / (s(s + 2))] = 1.6\n\nWhich is:\n\n(18) / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6\n\nSo, 18 divided by [s(s + 2)] equals 1.6.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6\n\nSo, let's solve for s.\n\nMultiply both sides by s(s + 2):\n\n18 = 1.6 * s(s + 2)\n\nCompute 1.6 * s(s + 2) = 1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s - 18 = 0\n\nHmm, quadratic equation.

Then, when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, I can compute the walking time and add t_h to get the total time in hours, then convert back to minutes if needed.\n\nLet me write the equations out:\n\nEquation 1: 9 = s*(4 - t_h)\nEquation 2: 9 = (s + 2)*(2.4 - t_h)\n\nI can expand both equations.\n\nFrom equation 1: 9 = 4s - s*t_h\nFrom equation 2: 9 = (s + 2)*(2.4 - t_h) = s*(2.4 - t_h) + 2*(2.4 - t_h) = 2.4s - s*t_h + 4.8 - 2*t_h\n\nSo, equation 2 becomes: 9 = 2.4s - s*t_h + 4.8 - 2*t_h\n\nNow, let me write both equations:\n\n1. 9 = 4s - s*t_h\n2. 9 = 2.4s - s*t_h + 4.8 - 2*t_h\n\nHmm, so now I have two equations with two variables, s and t_h.\n\nLet me subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate some variables.\n\nEquation 2 minus Equation 1:\n\n9 - 9 = (2.4s - s*t_h + 4.8 - 2*t_h) - (4s - s*t_h)\n\nSimplify right side:\n\n0 = 2.4s - s*t_h +4.8 -2*t_h -4s + s*t_h\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n2.4s -4s = -1.6s\n\n-s*t_h + s*t_h = 0\n\n4.8 remains\n\n-2*t_h remains\n\nSo, 0 = -1.6s + 4.8 -2*t_h\n\nRearranged: 1.6s + 2*t_h = 4.8\n\nHmm, that's one equation.\n\nI can write this as:\n\n1.6s + 2t_h = 4.8 --> Let's call this Equation 3.\n\nNow, from equation 1: 9 = 4s - s*t_h\n\nI can write equation 1 as:\n\n4s - s*t_h = 9 --> Equation 1\n\nLet me see if I can express t_h from equation 1 in terms of s.\n\nFrom equation 1: 4s - s t_h = 9\n\nLet me factor s: s*(4 - t_h) = 9\n\nSo, 4 - t_h = 9/s --> t_h = 4 - 9/s\n\nHmm, so t_h = 4 - (9/s)\n\nNow, plug this into equation 3:\n\n1.6s + 2*(4 - 9/s) = 4.8\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n1.6s + 8 - (18/s) = 4.8\n\nNow, subtract 4.8 from both sides:\n\n1.6s + 8 - 4.8 - (18/s) = 0\n\nSimplify 8 -4.8 = 3.2\n\nSo, 1.6s + 3.2 - 18/s = 0\n\nMultiply all terms by s to eliminate denominator:\n\n1.6s^2 + 3.2s - 18 = 0\n\nHmm, let's write this equation:\n\n1.6s\u00b2 + 3.2s - 18 = 0\n\nTo make it easier, perhaps multiply all terms by 10 to eliminate decimals:\n\n16s\u00b2 + 32s - 180 = 0",

Let me compute the numerator first:\n\ns*(144 - 48s) = 144s - 48s\u00b2\n\nSo, the fraction becomes (144s - 48s\u00b2)/60 = (144s/60) - (48s\u00b2)/60\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n144/60 = 2.4, so 2.4s\n\n48/60 = 0.8, so 0.8s\u00b2\n\nSo, the fraction is 2.4s - 0.8s\u00b2\n\nSo, substituting back into the equation:\n\n9 = 4s - (2.4s - 0.8s\u00b2)\n\nWhich is 4s -2.4s + 0.8s\u00b2\n\nSimplify:\n\n(4s - 2.4s) = 1.6s\n\nSo, 9 = 1.6s + 0.8s\u00b2\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n0.8s\u00b2 + 1.6s - 9 = 0\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic equation in terms of s.

So, the equation would be:\n\n9/s + t/60 = 4.\n\nSimilarly, for the second scenario: she walks at 's + 2' km/h, and the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let's convert 24 minutes to hours: 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So, 2.4 hours total. Again, that's walking time plus coffee time. So, walking time is 9/(s + 2) hours, and total time is 2.4 hours. So, the equation is:\n\n9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4.\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1) 9/s + t/60 = 4\n2) 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4\n\nI can subtract the second equation from the first, maybe, to eliminate 't'. Let's try that.\n\nSo, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:\n\n[9/s + t/60] - [9/(s + 2) + t/60] = 4 - 2.4\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6\n\nSo, 9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6\n\nHmm, now I can factor out the 9:\n\n9 [1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 1.6\n\nLet me compute the terms inside the brackets:\n\n1/s - 1/(s + 2) = [(s + 2) - s]/(s(s + 2)) ) = 2/(s(s + 2))\n\nSo, 9 * [2/(s(s + 2))] = 1.6\n\nWhich is 18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6\n\nSo, 18 = 1.6 * s(s + 2)\n\nLet me compute 1.6 * s(s + 2) = 1.6 s\u00b2 + 3.2 s\n\nSo, 18 = 1.6 s\u00b2 + 3.2 s\n\nLet me write that as: 1.6 s\u00b2 + 3.2 s - 18 = 0",

This substitution might make the equations easier.\n\nThen, Equation 1 becomes:\n9 = s*(4 - x)\nSo, s = 9 / (4 - x)\n\nEquation 2 becomes:\n9 = (s + 2)*(2.4 - x)\ns + 2 = 9 / (2.4 - x)\nSo, s = [9 / (2.4 - x)] - 2\n\nNow, set the two expressions for 's' equal:\n\n9 / (4 - x) = [9 / (2.4 - x)] - 2\n\nLet me write this equation:\n\n9/(4 - x) + 2 = 9/(2.4 - x)\n\nHmm, let me rearrange terms.\n\nLet me subtract 9/(2.4 - x) from both sides:\n\n9/(4 - x) - 9/(2.4 - x) + 2 = 0",

Let's try that.\n\nSo, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:\n\n[9/s + t/60] - [9/(s + 2) + t/60] = 4 - 2.4\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6\n\nSo, 9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6\n\nHmm, now I can factor out the 9:\n\n9 [1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 1.6\n\nLet me compute the terms inside the brackets:\n\n1/s - 1/(s + 2) = [(s + 2) - s]/(s(s + 2)) ) = 2/(s(s + 2))\n\nSo, 9 * [2/(s(s + 2))] = 1.6\n\nWhich is 18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6\n\nSo, 18 = 1.6 * s(s + 2)\n\nLet me compute 1.6 * s(s + 2) = 1.6 s\u00b2 + 3.2 s\n\nSo, 18 = 1.6 s\u00b2 + 3.2 s\n\nLet me write that as: 1.6 s\u00b2 + 3.2 s - 18 = 0",
          "text2": "But wait, I'm mixing units here. 't' is in minutes, and the walking times are in hours. I should convert everything to the same unit to avoid confusion. Let me convert 't' into hours.\n\nSo, 't' minutes is 't/60' hours.\n\nIn the first scenario:\nWalking speed = s km/h\nTotal time = 4 hours = walking time + coffee time\nSo, walking time = 4 - (t/60) hours.\n\nThe distance is 9 km, which is equal to speed multiplied by time. So:\n\n9 = s * (4 - t/60)\n\nSimilarly, in the second scenario:\nWalking speed = s + 2 km/h\nTotal time = 2 hours 24 minutes, which is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours.\nWalking time = 2.4 - (t/60) hours.\n\nAgain, distance is 9 km:\n\n9 = (s + 2) * (2.4 - t/60)\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1) 9 = s*(4 - t/60)\n2) 9 = (s + 2)*(2.4 - t/60)\n\nI need to solve these two equations to find 's' and 't'. Once I have those, I can calculate the time when her speed is s + 1/2 km/h.\n\nLet me write both equations:\n\nEquation 1: 9 = s*(4 - t/60)\nEquation 2: 9 = (s + 2)*(2.4 - t/60)\n\nI can rearrange both equations to express them in terms of s and t.\n\nStarting with Equation 1:\ns = 9 / (4 - t/60)\n\nEquation 2:\ns + 2 = 9 / (2.4 - t/60)\nSo, s = [9 / (2.4 - t/60)] - 2\n\nNow, since both expressions equal 's', I can set them equal to each other:\n\n9 / (4 - t/60) = [9 / (2.4 - t/60)] - 2\n\nHmm, this looks a bit complicated, but I can solve for 't' first.\n\nLet me denote x = t/60, so that t = 60x. This substitution might make the equations easier.\n\nThen, Equation 1 becomes:\n9 = s*(4 - x)\nSo, s = 9 / (4 - x)\n\nEquation 2 becomes:\n9 = (s + 2)*(2.4 - x)\ns + 2 = 9 / (2.4 - x)\nSo, s = [9 / (2.4 - x)] - 2\n\nNow, set the two expressions for 's' equal:\n\n9 / (4 - x) = [9 / (2.4 - x)] - 2\n\nLet me write this equation:\n\n9/(4 - x) + 2 = 9/(2.4 - x)\n\nHmm, let me rearrange terms.\n\nLet me subtract 9/(2.4 - x) from both sides:\n\n9/(4 - x) - 9/(2.4 - x) + 2 = 0",
