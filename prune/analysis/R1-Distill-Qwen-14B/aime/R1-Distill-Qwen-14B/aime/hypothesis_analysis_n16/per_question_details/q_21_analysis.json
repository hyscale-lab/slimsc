Since we're dealing with integers, perhaps I can express this as:\n\nLet me denote d = b - m and e = b + m, so that d*e = 4c(b -1)\n\nAlso, since d and e are factors such that d*e = 4c(b-1), and e > d because m is positive.\n\nMoreover, since d = b - m and e = b + m, adding them gives d + e = 2b, and subtracting gives e - d = 2m. So both d and e must be even because 2b and 2m are even.\n\nTherefore, d and e are both even, which implies that 4c(b -1) must be divisible by 4, which it is because of the 4c term.

So, m must be odd because m^2 is 1 mod 4 (since 4a(b-1) is 0 mod 4, so m^2 is 1 mod 4, which implies m is odd).\n\nSo, m is odd, say m = 2k + 1 for some integer k.

Let me try to understand what it's asking for. \n\nFirst, the problem defines a positive integer n as b-eautiful if two conditions are met. One, when n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits. Two, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. \n\nThe example given is 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63. The digits 6 and 3 add up to 9, which is the square root of 81. That makes sense. \n\nSo, the task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. \n\nLet me break down what I know:\n\n1. In base b, a two-digit number is represented as a1 * b^1 + a0 * b^0, where a1 and a0 are the digits. Since it's a two-digit number, a1 can't be zero, and both a1 and a0 must be less than b.\n\n2. The two digits sum to the square root of n. So, a1 + a0 = sqrt(n).",

If yes, compute d1 and check if it's a valid digit. Then check d0.\n\nSo, to find the number of b-eautiful numbers for each b, we can:\n\n1.

Which means that (b-1) is a divisor of m(m-1).\n\nBut m and m-1 are coprime, since they're consecutive integers.\n\nThus, (b-1) must be a product of two coprime factors, one dividing m and the other dividing m-1.\n\nTherefore, for each m, the number of possible d's (i.e., b-1) is equal to the number of ways to write d as k*l, where k divides m, l divides m-1, and gcd(k,l)=1.\n\nThus, for each m, the number of such d's is equal to the number of pairs (k,l) such that k*l divides m(m-1), gcd(k,l)=1, and d=k*l >=m.\n\nEach such d corresponds to a base b = d +1.\n\nHence, for each m, the number of bases b it contributes to is equal to the number of such pairs (k,l).\n\nBut since this is complicated, perhaps it's better to note that for each m, the number of bases b it contributes to is equal to the number of divisors d of m(m-1) that are >=m.\n\nThus, for a given b, the number of m's is equal to the number of m's where d = b-1 divides m(m-1), and d >=m.\n\nTherefore, for each b, the count is equal to the number of m's in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that m(m-1) is divisible by (b-1).\n\nBut without a computational approach, it's hard to find which b has more than ten such m's.\n\nBut perhaps I can note that for a base b, the number of m's is equal to the number of divisors d of m(m-1) equal to b-1, and d >=m.\n\nThus, for a given b, the number of m's is equal to the number of m's in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (b-1) divides m(m-1).\n\nWhich is equivalent to m \u22610 or 1 mod (b-1), but as I saw earlier, this isn't necessarily the case.",

Let me try to understand what it's asking for. \n\nFirst, the problem defines a positive integer n as b-eautiful if two conditions are met. One, when n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits. Two, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. \n\nThe example given is 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63. The digits 6 and 3 add up to 9, which is the square root of 81. That makes sense. \n\nSo, the task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. \n\nLet me break down what I know:\n\n1. In base b, a two-digit number is represented as a1 * b^1 + a0 * b^0, where a1 and a0 are the digits. Since it's a two-digit number, a1 can't be zero, and both a1 and a0 must be less than b.\n\n2. The two digits sum to the square root of n. So, a1 + a0 = sqrt(n).",

Let me try to understand what it's asking for. \n\nFirst, the problem defines a positive integer n as b-eautiful if two conditions are met. One, when n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits. Two, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. \n\nThe example given is 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63. The digits 6 and 3 add up to 9, which is the square root of 81. That makes sense. \n\nSo, the task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. \n\nLet me break down what I know:\n\n1. In base b, a two-digit number is represented as a1 * b^1 + a0 * b^0, where a1 and a0 are the digits. Since it's a two-digit number, a1 can't be zero, and both a1 and a0 must be less than b.\n\n2. The two digits sum to the square root of n. So, a1 + a0 = sqrt(n).",

Let's see.\n\nFrom d1*(b - 1) = s^2 - s.\n\nWe can denote k = b - 1, so d1*k = s^2 - s.\n\nSo d1 = (s^2 - s)/k.\n\nSince d1 must be an integer, k must divide s^2 - s.\n\nAlso, d1 must be at least 1, so (s^2 - s)/k \u2265 1.\n\nAnd d1 \u2264 k, because d1 is a digit in base b, so d1 \u2264 b - 1 = k.\n\nSimilarly, d0 = s - d1 must be \u2264 k, so s - d1 \u2264 k.\n\nBut since d1 = (s^2 - s)/k, then s - (s^2 - s)/k \u2264 k.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\ns - (s^2 - s)/k \u2264 k\n\nMultiply both sides by k (assuming k > 0, which it is since b \u2265 2):\n\nk*s - (s^2 - s) \u2264 k^2\n\nSimplify:\n\nk*s - s^2 + s \u2264 k^2\n\nRearranged:\n\n-s^2 + (k + 1)*s - k^2 \u2264 0\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 (which flips the inequality):\n\ns^2 - (k + 1)*s + k^2 \u2265 0\n\nWhich is a quadratic in s: s^2 - (k + 1)s + k^2 \u2265 0.\n\nLet me compute the discriminant of this quadratic:\n\n\u0394 = (k + 1)^2 - 4*1*k^2 = k^2 + 2k + 1 - 4k^2 = -3k^2 + 2k + 1.\n\nHmm, the quadratic will be \u22650 when s \u2264 [something] or s \u2265 [something else]. Let me find the roots.\n\ns = [ (k + 1) \u00b1 sqrt( (k + 1)^2 - 4k^2 ) ] / 2\n\nWhich is:\n\ns = [ (k + 1) \u00b1 sqrt( -3k^2 + 2k + 1 ) ] / 2",

Therefore, s < b.\n\nSo, s can be at most b -1 because s is an integer. So, s is in 1, 2, ..., b-1.\n\nSo, that's an important point. So, s ranges from 1 to b-1.\n\nGiven that, let's get back to the equation:\n\ns(s - 1) = d1*(b - 1).\n\nSo, for each s, d1 must be a divisor of s(s-1), and since d1 is a digit in base b, it must satisfy 1 <= d1 < b.\n\nSo, for a given b, we can iterate over s from 2 to b-1 (since s must be at least d1 + d0, which is at least 1 + 0 = 1, but s(s-1) would be zero when s=1, which would imply d1*(b-1)=0, but d1 >=1, so s cannot be 1). So, s starts from 2.\n\nFor each s, compute s(s - 1). Then, find all possible d1 that divides s(s - 1), such that d1 < b, and then compute d0 = s - d1.

For example, in base 10, s can be up to 18.\n\nBut for each b, s can range from 1 (since d1 is at least 1 and d0 is at least 0, so s is at least 1) up to 2*(b-1). However, s must be at least 1, but also, since n = d1*b + d0, and n must be a perfect square because sqrt(n) is an integer (as s is an integer).",

So, m must be odd because m^2 is 1 mod 4 (since 4a(b-1) is 0 mod 4, so m^2 is 1 mod 4, which implies m is odd).\n\nSo, m is odd, say m = 2k + 1 for some integer k. Then,\n\n(2k + 1 -1)(2k + 1 +1) = 4a(b - 1)\n\nSimplify:\n\n(2k)(2k + 2) = 4a(b -1)\n\nWhich is:\n\n4k(k +1) =4a(b -1)\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\nk(k +1) = a(b -1)\n\nSo, now we have:\n\nk(k +1) = a(b -1)\n\nSince a is a digit in base b, a is between 1 and b-1. So, a is a positive integer less than b.\n\nSo, k(k +1) must be equal to a*(b -1). Let's denote this as equation (1):\n\nk(k +1) = a*(b -1)\n\nNow, also, from the quadratic equation in c, we have:\n\nc = [-(2a -1) \u00b1 m]/2\n\nBut m = 2k +1, so let's substitute that:\n\nc = [-(2a -1) \u00b1 (2k +1)] /2\n\nWe can consider both the plus and minus cases.\n\nCase 1: c = [-(2a -1) + (2k +1)] /2\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n-2a +1 + 2k +1 = (-2a + 2k + 2)\n\nDivide by 2:\n\n(-2a + 2k +2)/2 = (-a + k +1)\n\nSo, c = -a + k +1\n\nCase 2: c = [-(2a -1) - (2k +1)] /2\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n-2a +1 -2k -1 = (-2a -2k)\n\nDivide by 2:\n\n(-2a -2k)/2 = -a -k\n\nBut c has to be a non-negative integer (since it's a digit in base b), so in Case 2, c = -a -k must be \u22650.\n\nHowever, since a and k are positive integers (a \u22651, k \u22650 because m = 2k +1 \u22651, so k \u22650), -a -k \u2264 -1, which is negative. Therefore, Case 2 would give c negative, which is impossible because c must be \u22650. So, only Case 1 is valid.\n\nTherefore, from Case 1:\n\nc = -a + k +1\n\nSo, c = (k +1) - a\n\nBut c must satisfy 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b-1, since it's a digit in base b.
