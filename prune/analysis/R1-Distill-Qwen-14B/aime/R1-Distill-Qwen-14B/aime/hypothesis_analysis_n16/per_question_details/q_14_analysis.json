Let's call this equation7.\n\nNow, let's look at equation5: 6a -d \u22615 mod7.\n\nFrom equation7: 3c -d \u22612 mod7.\n\nSo, from equation5 and equation7, we can relate 6a and 3c.\n\nLet's write them:\n\n6a -d \u22615 (equation5),\n\n3c -d \u22612 (equation7).\n\nSubtract equation7 from equation5:\n\n6a -d - (3c -d) \u22615 -2=3 mod7.\n\nSimplify: 6a -d -3c +d \u22613 mod7.\n\nSo, 6a -3c \u22613 mod7.\n\nFactor out 3: 3(2a -c) \u22613 mod7.\n\nDivide both sides by 3 (since 3 and 7 are coprime, division is allowed):\n\n2a -c \u22611 mod7.\n\nSo, 2a -c \u22611 mod7.

Let's call this equation9.\n\nNow, equation3:6a +2b +d \u22614 mod7.\n\nFrom equation5: 6a -d \u22615 mod7.\n\nIf we add equation3 and equation5:\n\n(6a +2b +d) + (6a -d) \u22614 +5=9\u22612 mod7.\n\nSo, 12a +2b \u22612 mod7.\n\nBut 12 mod7 is 5, so 5a +2b \u22612 mod7. Let's call this equation10.\n\nFrom equation9:6a -2b \u22614 mod7.\n\nLet me write equation10 and equation9:\n\nequation10:5a +2b \u22612 mod7.\n\nequation9:6a -2b \u22614 mod7.\n\nIf we add equation9 and equation10:\n\n(5a +2b) + (6a -2b) =11a \u22616 mod7.\n\nSo, 11a \u22616 mod7.\n\nBut 11 mod7 is 4, so 4a \u22616 mod7.\n\nMultiply both sides by the inverse of 4 mod7. The inverse of 4 mod7 is 2, because 4*2=8\u22611 mod7.\n\nSo, a \u22616*2=12\u22615 mod7.\n\nSo, a \u22615 mod7.\n\nSince a is a digit (a is from 1 to 9, as it's the thousands digit), the possible values for a are 5 and 12, but 12 is not a digit, so a=5.\n\nSo, a=5.\n\nNow, let's find c from equation8: c \u22612a -1 mod7.\n\na=5, so c \u22612*5 -1=10-1=9\u22612 mod7.",

Because even though we derived these congruences, it's possible that when we choose the maximum b, c, d for a given a, it might not satisfy all four conditions. So, perhaps we should verify.\n\nBut given that the congruences were derived from the conditions, if we correctly follow them, the resulting N should satisfy the conditions. But perhaps it's better to verify each step.\n\nSo, let me start with a=9.\n\nCase 1: a=9.\n\nCompute b_mod = (3*9 -2) mod7 = (27-2)=25 mod7. 25/7=3*7=21, 25-21=4 \u2192 b_mod=4.\n\nSo, b must be \u22614 mod7. The maximum possible b \u22649 is 9, but 9 mod7=2. So, need the largest b \u22649 where b\u22614 mod7. The possible b's are 4,11 (but 11>9). So the largest is 4.",

Which is true. So, Equation (8) is redundant given Equations (5), (6), and (7).

So b=4.\n\nc \u22612a +6 mod7 \u2192 2*9=18 +6=24 \u219224 mod7: 7*3=21, 24-21=3 \u2192 c\u22613 mod7.\n\nPossible c: 3, 10 (invalid).

Because even though we derived these congruences, it's possible that when we choose the maximum b, c, d for a given a, it might not satisfy all four conditions. So, perhaps we should verify.\n\nBut given that the congruences were derived from the conditions, if we correctly follow them, the resulting N should satisfy the conditions. But perhaps it's better to verify each step.\n\nSo, let me start with a=9.\n\nCase 1: a=9.\n\nCompute b_mod = (3*9 -2) mod7 = (27-2)=25 mod7. 25/7=3*7=21, 25-21=4 \u2192 b_mod=4.\n\nSo, b must be \u22614 mod7. The maximum possible b \u22649 is 9, but 9 mod7=2. So, need the largest b \u22649 where b\u22614 mod7. The possible b's are 4,11 (but 11>9). So the largest is 4.",

So, 1000 \u22616 mod7.\n\nSimilarly, 100 mod7: 100/7=14*7=98, so 100\u22612 mod7.\n\n10 mod7 is 3, since 10-7=3.\n\nAnd 1 mod7 is 1.\n\nSo, let's compute each term:\n\n1000(a-1) mod7 = 6(a-1) mod7.\n\n100(b-1) mod7 = 2(b-1) mod7.\n\n10(c-1) mod7 =3(c-1) mod7.\n\n(d-1) mod7 = (d-1) mod7.\n\nSo, all four expressions must be equal mod7.\n\nSo:\n\n6(a-1) \u2261 2(b-1) \u22613(c-1) \u2261(d-1) mod7.\n\nSo, let me denote this common value as k mod7, so:\n\n6(a-1) \u2261 k,\n\n2(b-1) \u2261k,\n\n3(c-1)\u2261k,\n\nand (d-1)\u2261k mod7.\n\nSo, from each of these, we can express a, b, c, d in terms of k.\n\nLet me express each variable:\n\nFrom 6(a-1) \u2261k mod7 \u2192 a-1 \u22616^{-1}k mod7. Since 6 and7 are coprime, the inverse of6 mod7 is a number x where 6x \u22611 mod7. Let's find x: 6*6=36\u22611 mod7, so 6^{-1} is6 mod7.\n\nThus, a-1 \u22616k mod7 \u2192 a \u22611 +6k mod7.\n\nSimilarly, from 2(b-1)\u2261k mod7 \u2192 (b-1)\u22612^{-1}k mod7. 2^{-1} mod7 is 4, since 2*4=8\u22611 mod7. So, b-1\u22614k mod7 \u2192 b\u22611 +4k mod7.\n\nFrom 3(c-1)\u2261k mod7. 3^{-1} mod7 is5, because 3*5=15\u22611 mod7. So, c-1\u22615k mod7 \u2192 c\u22611 +5k mod7.\n\nFrom (d-1)\u2261k mod7 \u2192 d\u22611 +k mod7.\n\nSo, now, we have expressions for a, b, c, d in terms of k.\n\nBut a, b, c, d are digits. So, a is from1-9, others from0-9.\n\nBut since N is a four-digit number, a must be at least1 and at most9. So, let's think about each variable:\n\na = (1 +6k) mod7. But since a is between1 and9, we can write a as 1 +6k +7m, where m is a non-negative integer such that a remains \u22649.\n\nSimilarly, b =1 +4k +7n,\n\nc =1 +5k +7p,\n\nd=1 +k +7q.\n\nBut since b, c, d are digits (0-9), we have constraints on k such that these expressions don't exceed 9.\n\nSo, let's think about possible values of k. Since k is mod7, it can be from0 to6.\n\nBut let's think about each variable:\n\nFor a: a=1 +6k mod7. But since a is at least1, let's consider k from0 to6.\n\nBut a must be \u22649.\n\nSimilarly, b=1+4k mod7, so 1+4k \u22649 \u21924k\u22648 \u2192k\u22642. Because 4k can be up to 4*6=24, but if k is mod7, then 4k mod7.",

So, perhaps we should verify.\n\nBut given that the congruences were derived from the conditions, if we correctly follow them, the resulting N should satisfy the conditions. But perhaps it's better to verify each step.\n\nSo, let me start with a=9.\n\nCase 1: a=9.\n\nCompute b_mod = (3*9 -2) mod7 = (27-2)=25 mod7. 25/7=3*7=21, 25-21=4 \u2192 b_mod=4.\n\nSo, b must be \u22614 mod7. The maximum possible b \u22649 is 9, but 9 mod7=2. So, need the largest b \u22649 where b\u22614 mod7. The possible b's are 4,11 (but 11>9). So the largest is 4.",

So substitute into equation4:\n\n6a +2b + (2b +1) \u22616 mod7.\n\nSimplify:\n\n6a +4b +1 \u22616 mod7.\n\nSo, 6a +4b \u22615 mod7.\n\nFactor out 2: 2*(3a +2b) \u22615 mod7.\n\nHmm. So, 2*(3a +2b) \u22615 mod7.\n\nWe can multiply both sides by the inverse of 2 mod7, which is 4 since 2*4=8\u22611 mod7.\n\nSo, (3a +2b) \u22615*4 mod7 => 20 mod7. 20/7=2*7=14, 20-14=6. So 6 mod7.\n\nSo, 3a +2b \u22616 mod7.\n\nSo now, we have two equations:\n\nEquation A: 3c \u22612b +1 mod7.\n\nEquation B: 3a +2b \u22616 mod7.\n\nAdditionally, from equation1: 2b +3c +d \u22611 mod7.\n\nBut since 3c =2b +1 mod7, substitute into equation1:\n\n2b + (2b +1) +d \u22611 mod7.\n\nWhich is 4b +1 +d \u22611 mod7.\n\nSubtract 1: 4b +d \u22610 mod7.\n\nSo, equation C: 4b +d \u22610 mod7.\n\nFrom equation2: 6a +3c +d \u22615 mod7.\n\nBut 3c=2b +1, so substitute:\n\n6a + (2b +1) +d \u22615 mod7.\n\nSimplify: 6a +2b +1 +d \u22615 mod7.\n\nWhich becomes 6a +2b +d \u22614 mod7.",
