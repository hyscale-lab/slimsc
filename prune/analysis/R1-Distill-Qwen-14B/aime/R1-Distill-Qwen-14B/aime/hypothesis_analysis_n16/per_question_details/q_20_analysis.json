If the cell is already white, adding a chip isn't needed.\n\nBut in the case of an empty cell, if row i is white and column j is black, adding a white chip would require the column to become white, which is impossible because the column is black. Similarly, adding a black chip would require the row to become black, which is impossible because the row is white.\n\nThus, the grid is maximal if for every empty cell (i,j), row i and column j have different colors.\n\nWhich implies that the grid is a bipartition of the rows and columns into two colors, white and black, such that any empty cell is the intersection of a white row and black column, or black row and white column.\n\nThus, the grid is determined by choosing a subset of rows to be white, and a subset of columns to be white, with the remaining rows and columns being black.",
