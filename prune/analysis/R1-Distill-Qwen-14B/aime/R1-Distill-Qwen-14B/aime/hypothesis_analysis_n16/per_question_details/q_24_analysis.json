          "text1": "Wait, for example, if 9 appears twice, then no other number can appear twice or more. Because if another number also appears twice, then there would be two modes, making it bimodal, which contradicts the unique mode condition. So, in that case, 9 must appear more than any other number.\n\nSo, to have 9 as the unique mode, the count of 9s must be greater than the count of any other number.\n\nNext, the sum of all numbers is 30. So, the total is 30, and we have to include multiple 9s and other numbers that sum up to 30.\n\nAlso, the median is a positive integer not present in the list. So, when the numbers are sorted, the middle value is an integer (since it's a positive integer), but that integer is not in the list.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the list.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible number of elements in the list. Since the median is not an element in the list, the list must have an even number of elements. Because if the number of elements is odd, the median is the middle number, which would have to be in the list. So, if the median is not in the list, the number of elements must be even. Therefore, the list has an even number of elements.\n\nSo, the list has n elements, where n is even. Let's denote n as 2k, where k is an integer. Then, the median would be the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th elements. Since the median is an integer and not present in the list, this implies that the two middle numbers must be consecutive integers, and their average is an integer (so they are consecutive, which makes their average an integer). Also, since the median is not present, neither of these two middle numbers is equal to the median.",

Since the sum is 30, let's say the number of elements is n.\n\nThe minimal number of 9s needed to be the unique mode would be such that no other number appears as many times. So, if 9 appears k times, then every other number can appear at most k-1 times.\n\nLet me think about the minimal n. Let\u2019s say n is 5, but that's odd, so the median would be the 3rd number, which is in the list. Therefore, n can't be 5. So n has to be even.\n\nLet's try n=4. Then, the median is the average of the 2nd and 3rd numbers. Since the median is a positive integer not in the list, the average must be an integer.

If that's an integer and not present in the list, then (b + c) must be even, so b and c are either both even or both odd. But also, neither b nor c is equal to (b + c)/2. Hmm, interesting.\n\nSo, given that, let's start constructing the list.\n\nFirst, the mode is 9, which is unique. So 9 must appear more times than any other number. So the number of 9s must be strictly greater than the count of any other number. So, for example, if another number appears twice, 9 must appear at least three times. But since we want the minimal number of 9s to minimize the total sum, perhaps 9 appears twice, but no, wait, no.",

Let's see.\n\nThe minimal sum for t distinct positive integers is 1 + 2 + ... + t = t(t+1)/2.\n\nSo, we have 12 = sum of t distinct positive integers.\n\nSo, what t satisfies t(t+1)/2 <= 12.\n\nLet me compute t(t+1)/2 for t=4: 4*5/2=10 <=12\n\nt=5: 5*6/2=15>12.\n\nSo, t can be up to 4.\n\nSo, possible t=1: sum=1\nt=2: sum=3\nt=3: sum=6\nt=4: sum=10\n\nBut we need the sum to be 12. So, for t=4, the minimal sum is 10. We have 12-10=2 extra to distribute among the 4 numbers. So, we can add 1 to two of them, making them 2,3,4,5 (sum=14), wait that's too much.",

So, the list must have an even number of elements.\n\nSo, first point: the list has an even number of elements.\n\nLet me denote the number of elements as n, where n is even. Let's say n=2k for some integer k.\n\nNow, the median would be the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th elements when they are ordered. Since the median is an integer not present in the list, the two middle numbers must be two different integers whose average is an integer.

So, 9 appears more often than any other number. So, the count of 9s must be higher than the count of any other number.\n\nI need to construct a list of positive integers that satisfies all three conditions.\n\nLet me think about the structure of such a list.\n\nSince the sum is 30, and the mode is 9, which occurs more than any other number. So, the list must have several 9s.\n\nLet me denote the number of 9s as m. Since it's the unique mode, m must be greater than the count of any other number.\n\nSo, if another number appears t times, m > t for all t.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible number of 9s.\n\nSince all numbers are positive integers, and the sum is 30, the number of 9s can't be too large.\n\nFor example, if m=4, then 4*9=36, which is already more than 30, so that's too much.
