So, each of the four points A, B, C, D lies on this hyperbola.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates as follows:\n- Point A: (x, y)\n- Point C: (-x, -y) (since it's the opposite vertex of the diagonal)\n- Point B: (p, q)\n- Point D: (-p, -q)\n\nSo, the diagonals are AC and BD, with AC connecting (x, y) to (-x, -y) and BD connecting (p, q) to (-p, -q). \n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. So, the slope of AC is (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x. The slope of BD is (q - (-q))/(p - (-p)) = (2q)/(2p) = q/p. So, their product should be (y/x)*(q/p) = -1. So, (y q)/(x p) = -1. So, y q = -x p. That's one condition.\n\nAlso, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, which equals the distance between C and D, and so on.\n\nLet me write down the distance between A and B. That would be sqrt[(p - x)\u00b2 + (q - y)\u00b2]. Similarly, the distance between B and C is sqrt[(-x - p)\u00b2 + (-y - q)\u00b2]. Since ABCD is a rhombus, these distances must be equal:\n\nsqrt[(p - x)\u00b2 + (q - y)\u00b2] = sqrt[(-x - p)\u00b2 + (-y - q)\u00b2]\n\nLet me square both sides to remove the square roots:\n\n(p - x)\u00b2 + (q - y)\u00b2 = (-x - p)\u00b2 + (-y - q)\u00b2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: (p\u00b2 - 2px + x\u00b2) + (q\u00b2 - 2qy + y\u00b2)\nRight side: (p\u00b2 + 2px + x\u00b2) + (q\u00b2 + 2qy + y\u00b2)\n\nSubtracting left from right:\n\nLeft - Right = (-2px - 2qy) - (2px + 2qy) = -4px -4qy = 0\n\nSo, -4px -4qy = 0 => px + qy = 0.\n\nHmm, that's another condition. So now, we have two conditions:\n\n1. y q = -x p (from the slopes being perpendicular)\n2. p x + q y = 0 (from the equal sides)\n\nLooking at these two equations together:\n\nFrom condition 1: y q = -x p \u2192 y q + x p = 0.\n\nWhich is the same as condition 2: p x + q y = 0. So, both conditions are the same.\n\nSo, that gives us one equation: p x + q y = 0.\n\nNow, since points A and B lie on the hyperbola, their coordinates must satisfy x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 and p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nEquation 1: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nEquation 2: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nAnd from the rhombus condition:\n\nEquation 3: p x + q y = 0\n\nSo, three equations with four variables: x, y, p, q.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2, which is the square of the length of diagonal BD.\n\nSince BD connects (p, q) to (-p, -q), its length is sqrt[( -p - p)^2 + (-q - q)^2] = sqrt[(-2p)^2 + (-2q)^2] = sqrt[4p\u00b2 + 4q\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). Therefore, BD\u00b2 is (2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). Therefore, we need to find the maximum lower bound for BD\u00b2, which is the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nSo, essentially, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, and the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum.

So, each of the four points A, B, C, D lies on this hyperbola.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates as follows:\n- Point A: (x, y)\n- Point C: (-x, -y) (since it's the opposite vertex of the diagonal)\n- Point B: (p, q)\n- Point D: (-p, -q)\n\nSo, the diagonals are AC and BD, with AC connecting (x, y) to (-x, -y) and BD connecting (p, q) to (-p, -q). \n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. So, the slope of AC is (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x. The slope of BD is (q - (-q))/(p - (-p)) = (2q)/(2p) = q/p. So, their product should be (y/x)*(q/p) = -1. So, (y q)/(x p) = -1. So, y q = -x p. That's one condition.\n\nAlso, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, which equals the distance between C and D, and so on.\n\nLet me write down the distance between A and B. That would be sqrt[(p - x)\u00b2 + (q - y)\u00b2]. Similarly, the distance between B and C is sqrt[(-x - p)\u00b2 + (-y - q)\u00b2]. Since ABCD is a rhombus, these distances must be equal:\n\nsqrt[(p - x)\u00b2 + (q - y)\u00b2] = sqrt[(-x - p)\u00b2 + (-y - q)\u00b2]\n\nLet me square both sides to remove the square roots:\n\n(p - x)\u00b2 + (q - y)\u00b2 = (-x - p)\u00b2 + (-y - q)\u00b2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: (p\u00b2 - 2px + x\u00b2) + (q\u00b2 - 2qy + y\u00b2)\nRight side: (p\u00b2 + 2px + x\u00b2) + (q\u00b2 + 2qy + y\u00b2)\n\nSubtracting left from right:\n\nLeft - Right = (-2px - 2qy) - (2px + 2qy) = -4px -4qy = 0\n\nSo, -4px -4qy = 0 => px + qy = 0.\n\nHmm, that's another condition. So now, we have two conditions:\n\n1. y q = -x p (from the slopes being perpendicular)\n2. p x + q y = 0 (from the equal sides)\n\nLooking at these two equations together:\n\nFrom condition 1: y q = -x p \u2192 y q + x p = 0.\n\nWhich is the same as condition 2: p x + q y = 0. So, both conditions are the same.\n\nSo, that gives us one equation: p x + q y = 0.\n\nNow, since points A and B lie on the hyperbola, their coordinates must satisfy x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 and p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nEquation 1: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nEquation 2: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nAnd from the rhombus condition:\n\nEquation 3: p x + q y = 0\n\nSo, three equations with four variables: x, y, p, q.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2, which is the square of the length of diagonal BD.\n\nSince BD connects (p, q) to (-p, -q), its length is sqrt[( -p - p)^2 + (-q - q)^2] = sqrt[(-2p)^2 + (-2q)^2] = sqrt[4p\u00b2 + 4q\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). Therefore, BD\u00b2 is (2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). Therefore, we need to find the maximum lower bound for BD\u00b2, which is the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nSo, essentially, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, and the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum. But the question is phrased as the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, perhaps it's the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2.",

So, each of the four points A, B, C, D lies on this hyperbola.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates as follows:\n- Point A: (x, y)\n- Point C: (-x, -y) (since it's the opposite vertex of the diagonal)\n- Point B: (p, q)\n- Point D: (-p, -q)\n\nSo, the diagonals are AC and BD, with AC connecting (x, y) to (-x, -y) and BD connecting (p, q) to (-p, -q). \n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. So, the slope of AC is (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x. The slope of BD is (q - (-q))/(p - (-p)) = (2q)/(2p) = q/p. So, their product should be (y/x)*(q/p) = -1. So, (y q)/(x p) = -1. So, y q = -x p. That's one condition.\n\nAlso, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, which equals the distance between C and D, and so on.\n\nLet me write down the distance between A and B. That would be sqrt[(p - x)\u00b2 + (q - y)\u00b2]. Similarly, the distance between B and C is sqrt[(-x - p)\u00b2 + (-y - q)\u00b2]. Since ABCD is a rhombus, these distances must be equal:\n\nsqrt[(p - x)\u00b2 + (q - y)\u00b2] = sqrt[(-x - p)\u00b2 + (-y - q)\u00b2]\n\nLet me square both sides to remove the square roots:\n\n(p - x)\u00b2 + (q - y)\u00b2 = (-x - p)\u00b2 + (-y - q)\u00b2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: (p\u00b2 - 2px + x\u00b2) + (q\u00b2 - 2qy + y\u00b2)\nRight side: (p\u00b2 + 2px + x\u00b2) + (q\u00b2 + 2qy + y\u00b2)\n\nSubtracting left from right:\n\nLeft - Right = (-2px - 2qy) - (2px + 2qy) = -4px -4qy = 0\n\nSo, -4px -4qy = 0 => px + qy = 0.\n\nHmm, that's another condition. So now, we have two conditions:\n\n1. y q = -x p (from the slopes being perpendicular)\n2. p x + q y = 0 (from the equal sides)\n\nLooking at these two equations together:\n\nFrom condition 1: y q = -x p \u2192 y q + x p = 0.\n\nWhich is the same as condition 2: p x + q y = 0. So, both conditions are the same.\n\nSo, that gives us one equation: p x + q y = 0.\n\nNow, since points A and B lie on the hyperbola, their coordinates must satisfy x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 and p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nEquation 1: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nEquation 2: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nAnd from the rhombus condition:\n\nEquation 3: p x + q y = 0\n\nSo, three equations with four variables: x, y, p, q.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2, which is the square of the length of diagonal BD.\n\nSince BD connects (p, q) to (-p, -q), its length is sqrt[( -p - p)^2 + (-q - q)^2] = sqrt[(-2p)^2 + (-2q)^2] = sqrt[4p\u00b2 + 4q\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). Therefore, BD\u00b2 is (2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). Therefore, we need to find the maximum lower bound for BD\u00b2, which is the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nSo, essentially, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, and the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum. But the question is phrased as the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, perhaps it's the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2.",

So, each of the four points A, B, C, D lies on this hyperbola.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates as follows:\n- Point A: (x, y)\n- Point C: (-x, -y) (since it's the opposite vertex of the diagonal)\n- Point B: (p, q)\n- Point D: (-p, -q)\n\nSo, the diagonals are AC and BD, with AC connecting (x, y) to (-x, -y) and BD connecting (p, q) to (-p, -q). \n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. So, the slope of AC is (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x. The slope of BD is (q - (-q))/(p - (-p)) = (2q)/(2p) = q/p. So, their product should be (y/x)*(q/p) = -1. So, (y q)/(x p) = -1. So, y q = -x p. That's one condition.\n\nAlso, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, which equals the distance between C and D, and so on.\n\nLet me write down the distance between A and B. That would be sqrt[(p - x)\u00b2 + (q - y)\u00b2]. Similarly, the distance between B and C is sqrt[(-x - p)\u00b2 + (-y - q)\u00b2]. Since ABCD is a rhombus, these distances must be equal:\n\nsqrt[(p - x)\u00b2 + (q - y)\u00b2] = sqrt[(-x - p)\u00b2 + (-y - q)\u00b2]\n\nLet me square both sides to remove the square roots:\n\n(p - x)\u00b2 + (q - y)\u00b2 = (-x - p)\u00b2 + (-y - q)\u00b2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: (p\u00b2 - 2px + x\u00b2) + (q\u00b2 - 2qy + y\u00b2)\nRight side: (p\u00b2 + 2px + x\u00b2) + (q\u00b2 + 2qy + y\u00b2)\n\nSubtracting left from right:\n\nLeft - Right = (-2px - 2qy) - (2px + 2qy) = -4px -4qy = 0\n\nSo, -4px -4qy = 0 => px + qy = 0.\n\nHmm, that's another condition. So now, we have two conditions:\n\n1. y q = -x p (from the slopes being perpendicular)\n2. p x + q y = 0 (from the equal sides)\n\nLooking at these two equations together:\n\nFrom condition 1: y q = -x p \u2192 y q + x p = 0.\n\nWhich is the same as condition 2: p x + q y = 0. So, both conditions are the same.\n\nSo, that gives us one equation: p x + q y = 0.\n\nNow, since points A and B lie on the hyperbola, their coordinates must satisfy x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 and p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nEquation 1: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nEquation 2: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nAnd from the rhombus condition:\n\nEquation 3: p x + q y = 0\n\nSo, three equations with four variables: x, y, p, q.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2, which is the square of the length of diagonal BD.\n\nSince BD connects (p, q) to (-p, -q), its length is sqrt[( -p - p)^2 + (-q - q)^2] = sqrt[(-2p)^2 + (-2q)^2] = sqrt[4p\u00b2 + 4q\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). Therefore, BD\u00b2 is (2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). Therefore, we need to find the maximum lower bound for BD\u00b2, which is the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nSo, essentially, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, and the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum. But the question is phrased as the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, perhaps it's the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2.",

So, each of the four points A, B, C, D lies on this hyperbola.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates as follows:\n- Point A: (x, y)\n- Point C: (-x, -y) (since it's the opposite vertex of the diagonal)\n- Point B: (p, q)\n- Point D: (-p, -q)\n\nSo, the diagonals are AC and BD, with AC connecting (x, y) to (-x, -y) and BD connecting (p, q) to (-p, -q). \n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. So, the slope of AC is (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x. The slope of BD is (q - (-q))/(p - (-p)) = (2q)/(2p) = q/p. So, their product should be (y/x)*(q/p) = -1. So, (y q)/(x p) = -1. So, y q = -x p. That's one condition.\n\nAlso, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, which equals the distance between C and D, and so on.\n\nLet me write down the distance between A and B. That would be sqrt[(p - x)\u00b2 + (q - y)\u00b2]. Similarly, the distance between B and C is sqrt[(-x - p)\u00b2 + (-y - q)\u00b2]. Since ABCD is a rhombus, these distances must be equal:\n\nsqrt[(p - x)\u00b2 + (q - y)\u00b2] = sqrt[(-x - p)\u00b2 + (-y - q)\u00b2]\n\nLet me square both sides to remove the square roots:\n\n(p - x)\u00b2 + (q - y)\u00b2 = (-x - p)\u00b2 + (-y - q)\u00b2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: (p\u00b2 - 2px + x\u00b2) + (q\u00b2 - 2qy + y\u00b2)\nRight side: (p\u00b2 + 2px + x\u00b2) + (q\u00b2 + 2qy + y\u00b2)\n\nSubtracting left from right:\n\nLeft - Right = (-2px - 2qy) - (2px + 2qy) = -4px -4qy = 0\n\nSo, -4px -4qy = 0 => px + qy = 0.\n\nHmm, that's another condition. So now, we have two conditions:\n\n1. y q = -x p (from the slopes being perpendicular)\n2. p x + q y = 0 (from the equal sides)\n\nLooking at these two equations together:\n\nFrom condition 1: y q = -x p \u2192 y q + x p = 0.\n\nWhich is the same as condition 2: p x + q y = 0. So, both conditions are the same.\n\nSo, that gives us one equation: p x + q y = 0.\n\nNow, since points A and B lie on the hyperbola, their coordinates must satisfy x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 and p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nEquation 1: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nEquation 2: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nAnd from the rhombus condition:\n\nEquation 3: p x + q y = 0\n\nSo, three equations with four variables: x, y, p, q.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2, which is the square of the length of diagonal BD.\n\nSince BD connects (p, q) to (-p, -q), its length is sqrt[( -p - p)^2 + (-q - q)^2] = sqrt[(-2p)^2 + (-2q)^2] = sqrt[4p\u00b2 + 4q\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). Therefore, BD\u00b2 is (2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). Therefore, we need to find the maximum lower bound for BD\u00b2, which is the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nSo, essentially, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, and the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum. But the question is phrased as the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, perhaps it's the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2.",

Similarly, point C would be (-sqrt(20) cosh t, -sqrt(24) sinh t), since it's the reflection through the origin.\n\nSimilarly, point B can be (sqrt(20) cosh s, sqrt(24) sinh s), and point D would be (-sqrt(20) cosh s, -sqrt(24) sinh s).\n\nSo, now, we have points A, B, C, D in terms of parameters t and s.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance AB must equal BC, etc.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to use vectors. The sides AB and AD must have the same length.",

So, each of the four points A, B, C, D lies on this hyperbola.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates as follows:\n- Point A: (x, y)\n- Point C: (-x, -y) (since it's the opposite vertex of the diagonal)\n- Point B: (p, q)\n- Point D: (-p, -q)\n\nSo, the diagonals are AC and BD, with AC connecting (x, y) to (-x, -y) and BD connecting (p, q) to (-p, -q). \n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. So, the slope of AC is (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x. The slope of BD is (q - (-q))/(p - (-p)) = (2q)/(2p) = q/p. So, their product should be (y/x)*(q/p) = -1. So, (y q)/(x p) = -1. So, y q = -x p. That's one condition.\n\nAlso, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, which equals the distance between C and D, and so on.\n\nLet me write down the distance between A and B. That would be sqrt[(p - x)\u00b2 + (q - y)\u00b2]. Similarly, the distance between B and C is sqrt[(-x - p)\u00b2 + (-y - q)\u00b2]. Since ABCD is a rhombus, these distances must be equal:\n\nsqrt[(p - x)\u00b2 + (q - y)\u00b2] = sqrt[(-x - p)\u00b2 + (-y - q)\u00b2]\n\nLet me square both sides to remove the square roots:\n\n(p - x)\u00b2 + (q - y)\u00b2 = (-x - p)\u00b2 + (-y - q)\u00b2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: (p\u00b2 - 2px + x\u00b2) + (q\u00b2 - 2qy + y\u00b2)\nRight side: (p\u00b2 + 2px + x\u00b2) + (q\u00b2 + 2qy + y\u00b2)\n\nSubtracting left from right:\n\nLeft - Right = (-2px - 2qy) - (2px + 2qy) = -4px -4qy = 0\n\nSo, -4px -4qy = 0 => px + qy = 0.\n\nHmm, that's another condition. So now, we have two conditions:\n\n1. y q = -x p (from the slopes being perpendicular)\n2. p x + q y = 0 (from the equal sides)\n\nLooking at these two equations together:\n\nFrom condition 1: y q = -x p \u2192 y q + x p = 0.\n\nWhich is the same as condition 2: p x + q y = 0. So, both conditions are the same.\n\nSo, that gives us one equation: p x + q y = 0.\n\nNow, since points A and B lie on the hyperbola, their coordinates must satisfy x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 and p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nEquation 1: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nEquation 2: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nAnd from the rhombus condition:\n\nEquation 3: p x + q y = 0\n\nSo, three equations with four variables: x, y, p, q.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2, which is the square of the length of diagonal BD.\n\nSince BD connects (p, q) to (-p, -q), its length is sqrt[( -p - p)^2 + (-q - q)^2] = sqrt[(-2p)^2 + (-2q)^2] = sqrt[4p\u00b2 + 4q\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). Therefore, BD\u00b2 is (2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). Therefore, we need to find the maximum lower bound for BD\u00b2, which is the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nSo, essentially, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, and the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum. But the question is phrased as the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, perhaps it's the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2.",
