Now, using equation (5), x = y * 2^(1/12):\n\nx = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8 + 1/12)\n\nFind a common denominator for the exponents. 24 is a multiple of 8 and 12.\n\n-3/8 = -9/24, 1/12 = 2/24.\n\nSo, x = 2^(-9/24 + 2/24) = 2^(-7/24)\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24)\n\nNow, let's recap:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\ny = 2^(-3/8)\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nI think I can write all variables as exponents with base 2, so now I can compute the desired expression: |log\u2082(x^4 y^3 z^2)|.\n\nLet's compute the exponent first.\n\nCompute x^4: (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-7/24 * 4) = 2^(-7/6)\n\nCompute y^3: (2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8)\n\nCompute z^2: (2^(-5/12))^2 = 2^(-5/6)\n\nMultiply all together: x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6)\n\nSince when you multiply exponents with the same base, you add the exponents.\n\nSo, the exponent is:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nConvert all to 24 denominators:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n-9/8 = -27/24\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nSum: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24\n\nSimplify: -75/24 = -25/8\n\nSo, x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-25/8)\n\nSo, log\u2082 of that is log\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8\n\nThe absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8\n\nSo, m = 25, n = 8. They are coprime because 25 and 8 share no common factors besides 1.\n\nThus, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.",

Now, let's see if we can find another equation involving x and y.\n\nFrom equation 1: x = sqrt(2) * y z\n\nWe know z = 2^(-5/12), so x = sqrt(2) * y * 2^(-5/12)\n\nCompute sqrt(2) as 2^(1/2), so:\n\nx = 2^(1/2) * y * 2^(-5/12) = y * 2^(1/2 - 5/12)\n\nWhat's 1/2 - 5/12? 6/12 - 5/12 = 1/12.\n\nSo, x = y * 2^(1/12)\n\nSo, x = y * 2^(1/12)\n\nSo, x = y * 2^(1/12). Let's keep that in mind.\n\nEarlier, we found that x y = 2^(-2/3). Let's substitute x in terms of y into that.\n\nx y = (y * 2^(1/12)) * y = y\u00b2 * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3 - 1/12)\n\nCompute the exponents: -2/3 is -8/12, so -8/12 -1/12 = -9/12 = -3/4.\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = 2^(-3/4)\n\nTaking square root:\n\ny = 2^(-3/8)\n\nSince y is positive, we don't need to worry about the negative root.\n\nSo, y = 2^(-3/8)\n\nNow, since x = y * 2^(1/12), plug in y:\n\nx = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8 + 1/12)\n\nLet's compute the exponent:\n\nConvert to common denominator, which is 24.\n\n-3/8 = -9/24\n\n1/12 = 2/24\n\nSo, -9/24 + 2/24 = -7/24\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24)",

So:\n\nx y = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSo, x y = 2^(-2/3) ...(4)\n\nNow, from equation (1): x = y z * sqrt(2)\n\nWe have z = 2^(-5/12), and sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so:\n\nx = y * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/2) = y * 2^(-5/12 + 6/12) = y * 2^(1/12)\n\nSo, x = y * 2^(1/12) ...(5)\n\nNow, substitute equation (5) into equation (4):\n\nx y = (y * 2^(1/12)) * y = y^2 * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSo, y^2 * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nDivide both sides by 2^(1/12):\n\ny^2 = 2^(-2/3 - 1/12) = 2^(-8/12 - 1/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4)\n\nThus, y = 2^(-3/8)\n\nOkay, so y is 2^(-3/8). Now, using equation (5), x = y * 2^(1/12):\n\nx = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8 + 1/12)\n\nFind a common denominator for the exponents. 24 is a multiple of 8 and 12.\n\n-3/8 = -9/24, 1/12 = 2/24.\n\nSo, x = 2^(-9/24 + 2/24) = 2^(-7/24)\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24)\n\nNow, let's recap:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\ny = 2^(-3/8)\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nI think I can write all variables as exponents with base 2, so now I can compute the desired expression: |log\u2082(x^4 y^3 z^2)|.\n\nLet's compute the exponent first.\n\nCompute x^4: (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-7/24 * 4) = 2^(-7/6)\n\nCompute y^3: (2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8)\n\nCompute z^2: (2^(-5/12))^2 = 2^(-5/6)\n\nMultiply all together: x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6)\n\nSince when you multiply exponents with the same base, you add the exponents.\n\nSo, the exponent is:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nConvert all to 24 denominators:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n-9/8 = -27/24\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nSum: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24\n\nSimplify: -75/24 = -25/8\n\nSo, x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-25/8)\n\nSo, log\u2082 of that is log\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8\n\nThe absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8\n\nSo, m = 25, n = 8. They are coprime because 25 and 8 share no common factors besides 1.\n\nThus, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.",
          "text2": "Wait, but let me check that again. Because z squared was 2^(-5/6), so z is sqrt(2^(-5/6)).\n\nWhich is 2^(-5/12). Correct.\n\nSo, z = 2^(-5/12). Got it.\n\nNow, let's see equation 3: z = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nWe just found z, so let's plug that in.\n\n2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nSo, x y = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/4) = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSo, x y = 2^(-2/3)\n\nHmm, okay. Now, let's see if we can find another equation involving x and y.\n\nFrom equation 1: x = sqrt(2) * y z\n\nWe know z = 2^(-5/12), so x = sqrt(2) * y * 2^(-5/12)\n\nCompute sqrt(2) as 2^(1/2), so:\n\nx = 2^(1/2) * y * 2^(-5/12) = y * 2^(1/2 - 5/12)\n\nWhat's 1/2 - 5/12? 6/12 - 5/12 = 1/12.\n\nSo, x = y * 2^(1/12)\n\nSo, x = y * 2^(1/12)\n\nSo, x = y * 2^(1/12). Let's keep that in mind.\n\nEarlier, we found that x y = 2^(-2/3). Let's substitute x in terms of y into that.\n\nx y = (y * 2^(1/12)) * y = y\u00b2 * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3 - 1/12)\n\nCompute the exponents: -2/3 is -8/12, so -8/12 -1/12 = -9/12 = -3/4.\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = 2^(-3/4)\n\nTaking square root:\n\ny = 2^(-3/8)\n\nSince y is positive, we don't need to worry about the negative root.\n\nSo, y = 2^(-3/8)\n\nNow, since x = y * 2^(1/12), plug in y:\n\nx = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8 + 1/12)\n\nLet's compute the exponent:\n\nConvert to common denominator, which is 24.\n\n-3/8 = -9/24\n\n1/12 = 2/24\n\nSo, -9/24 + 2/24 = -7/24\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24)",

So:\n\nx = 2^(1/2) * y * 2^(-5/12) = y * 2^(1/2 - 5/12)\n\nConvert 1/2 to 6/12: 6/12 - 5/12 = 1/12.\n\nSo, x = y * 2^(1/12).\n\nSo, x = y * 2^(1/12). Let's call this Equation D.\n\nNow, from Equation D, x is expressed in terms of y.\n\nEarlier, from Equation C, we have x y = 2^(-2/3).\n\nSubstituting x from Equation D into x y:\n\n(y * 2^(1/12)) * y = 2^(-2/3)\n\nWhich is y^2 * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSo, y^2 = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3 - 1/12)\n\nConvert to twelfths: -2/3 is -8/12, -1/12 is -9/12.\n\nSo, y^2 = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4)\n\nThus, y = 2^(-3/8). Since y is positive.\n\nSo, y = 2^(-3/8).\n\nNow, from Equation D: x = y * 2^(1/12).\n\nSubstituting y:\n\nx = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8 + 1/12)\n\nFind a common denominator for exponents. 24 is a common denominator.\n\n-3/8 = -9/24, 1/12 = 2/24.\n\nSo, -9/24 + 2/24 = -7/24.\n\nThus, x = 2^(-7/24).",

So,\n\nx = y * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/2) = y * 2^(-5/12 + 6/12) = y * 2^(1/12)\n\nSo, x = y * 2^(1/12)\n\nSo, x = y * 2^(1/12).

Let's substitute x from equation 1b into this.\n\nx y = (y * 2^(1/12)) y = y^2 * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSo,\n\ny^2 * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nDivide both sides by 2^(1/12):\n\ny^2 = 2^(-2/3 - 1/12) = 2^(-8/12 - 1/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4)\n\nTaking square roots:\n\ny = 2^(-3/8)\n\nSince y is positive.\n\nGreat, so y is 2^(-3/8). Now, since x = y * 2^(1/12), substitute y:\n\nx = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8 + 1/12)\n\nLet's compute the exponents:\n\nConvert to common denominators. 24 is a common denominator.\n\n-3/8 = -9/24\n\n1/12 = 2/24\n\nSo, -9/24 + 2/24 = (-7)/24\n\nTherefore, x = 2^(-7/24)",

Let's substitute x in terms of y into that.\n\nx y = (y * 2^(1/12)) * y = y\u00b2 * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3 - 1/12)\n\nCompute the exponents: -2/3 is -8/12, so -8/12 -1/12 = -9/12 = -3/4.\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = 2^(-3/4)\n\nTaking square root:\n\ny = 2^(-3/8)\n\nSince y is positive, we don't need to worry about the negative root.\n\nSo, y = 2^(-3/8)\n\nNow, since x = y * 2^(1/12), plug in y:\n\nx = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8 + 1/12)\n\nLet's compute the exponent:\n\nConvert to common denominator, which is 24.\n\n-3/8 = -9/24\n\n1/12 = 2/24\n\nSo, -9/24 + 2/24 = -7/24\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24)",
