          "text1": "Wait, wait. Let me check: 15 (for P(0)) and 80 (for P(1)), so total of 95 combinations where she doesn't win a prize. So, P(B) is the probability that she wins a prize, which is 1 - 95/210.\n\nSo, 1 is 210/210, so 210 - 95 = 115. Thus, P(B) = 115/210.\n\nSimplify that: 115 and 210 are both divisible by 5. 115 \u00f7 5 =23, 210 \u00f7 5=42. So, 23/42.",
          "text2": "Wait, 90 is C(4,2)*C(6,2). Let me double-check:\n\nC(4,2)=6, C(6,2)=15, so 6*15=90.\n\nC(4,3)=4, C(6,1)=6, so 4*6=24.\n\nC(4,4)=1, C(6,0)=1, so 1*1=1.\n\n90+24=114, +1=115. So yes, 115.\n\nSo P(prize)=115/210=23/42.\n\nNow, P(grand prize)=1/210.\n\nTherefore, the conditional probability P(grand prize | prize) is (1/210) divided by (115/210). The 210s cancel out, so it's 1/115.\n\nSimplify that fraction: 1 and 115 are coprime, since 115 factors into 5*23, neither of which divides 1. So m=1, n=115, so m + n=1+115=116.",
