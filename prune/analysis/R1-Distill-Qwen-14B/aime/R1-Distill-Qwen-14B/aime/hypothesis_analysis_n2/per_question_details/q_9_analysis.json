Then, equation becomes x * k =10, so x=10/k.\n\n3. From the second equation, log_y(x^{4y})=10, which is 4y * log_y(x) =10.\n\n4. Since log_y(x) = 1 / log_x(y) = 1/k.\n\n5. So, equation becomes 4y * (1/k) =10 => 4y =10k => y= (10k)/4 = (5k)/2.\n\n6. Now, since k = log_x(y) = log_{10/k}(5k/2).\n\n7. Therefore, (10/k)^k =5k/2.\n\n8. Then, the product xy is (10/k) * (5k/2) =25.\n\nSo, according to this, xy is 25, regardless of the value of k. So, as long as the equations are satisfied, the product is 25.",
