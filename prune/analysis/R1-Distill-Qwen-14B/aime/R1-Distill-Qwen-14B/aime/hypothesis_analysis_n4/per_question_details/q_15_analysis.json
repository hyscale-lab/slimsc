So, three R runs and two U runs.\n\nEach R run has at least 1 step, each U run has at least 1 step.\n\nSo, the number of ways to distribute the 8 R's into three runs, each at least 1, is equivalent to the number of integer solutions to a + b + c = 8, where a, b, c \u2265 1. Similarly for U runs: d + e =8, d,e \u22651.\n\nSimilarly, for starting with U: runs U, R, U, R, U. So, three U runs (each \u22651) and two R runs (each \u22651).\n\nSo, the number of ways for starting with R is:\n\nNumber of ways to distribute R's: C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21.\n\nNumber of ways to distribute U's: C(8-1,2-1)= C(7,1)=7.\n\nSo, total for starting with R: 21*7=147.\n\nSimilarly, number of ways for starting with U: same, since it's symmetrical.\n\nSo, 21*7=147.\n\nTotal number of paths: 147*2=294.",

So, 1*2=2.\n\nSimilarly, starting with U: three U runs, two R runs. C(2,2)=1 for U runs, C(2,1)=2 for R runs. So, 1*2=2.\n\nTotal: 4 paths. Let me list them:\n\nStarting with R:\n\n1.
