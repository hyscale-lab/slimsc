So the sum is 2024, which is equal to the sum of 2^{a-1} for a in A.\n\nWhich is the same as the binary representation of 2024, where each set bit corresponds to a term in the sum.\n\nSo each set bit in 2024's binary representation corresponds to a term 2^{k}, which would be 2^{a-1} for some a in A. So solving 2^{a-1} = 2^{k} gives a-1=k, so a =k+1.\n\nTherefore, each set bit at position k (where 2^k is the value) corresponds to a in A being k+1.",
          "text2": "Wait, 2^{a-1} is equal to 2^{(a-1)}, so for a=1, it's 1, a=2, it's 2, a=3, it's 4, etc. So, for each a, the term is 2^{a-1}.\n\nSo, the sum over a in A of 2^{a-1} is equal to the binary number where for each a in A, the (a-1)th bit is set. So, if A is a set of integers, each a corresponds to a bit position in a binary number.\n\nSo, 2024 in binary would give me the bits that are set, which correspond to the a's in A. Then, each bit set in 2024's binary representation would correspond to an a in A being (bit position + 1).",
