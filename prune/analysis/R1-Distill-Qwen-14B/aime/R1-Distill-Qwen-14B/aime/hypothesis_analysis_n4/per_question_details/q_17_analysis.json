Let me think about the relationship between S and P=xyz and Q=xy + yz + xz.\n\nIn this case, for three variables, given P and Q, is there a way to find the minimal S?\n\nI recall that for three variables, (x + y + z)^2 >= 3(xy + yz + xz). So, S^2 >= 3*27=81\u2192 S>=9.\n\nBut is this the minimal? Because with equality when x=y=z=3, but earlier, that gives xyz=27, which is more than 23.
