If that's the case, it would simplify things.\n\nBut let me check. Let's compute the area of triangle ABC, and then see if the others are the same.\n\nCompute vectors for face ABC.\n\nPoints A(5/2,2,4), B(-5/2,-2,4), C(5/2,-2,-4).\n\nCompute vectors AB and AC:\n\nAB: from A to B: (-5, -4, 0)\nAC: from A to C: (0, -4, -8)\n\nCompute the cross product AB \u00d7 AC:\n\nAB = (-5, -4, 0)\nAC = (0, -4, -8)\n\nCross product:\n\n|i    j     k|\n|-5   -4    0|\n|0    -4   -8|\n\n= i [ (-4)(-8) - (0)(-4) ] - j [ (-5)(-8) - (0)(0) ] + k [ (-5)(-4) - (-4)(0) ]\n\n= i [32 - 0] - j [40 - 0] + k [20 - 0]\n\n=32i -40j +20k\n\nSo, cross product is (32, -40, 20)\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is sqrt(32\u00b2 + (-40)^2 +20\u00b2) = sqrt(1024 +1600 +400)=sqrt(3024)\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024):\n\n3024 divided by 16 is 189, so sqrt(16*189)=4*sqrt(189)\n\nFactor 189: 189=9*21=9*3*7=3\u00b3*7.\n\nSo sqrt(189)=3*sqrt(21). Thus, the magnitude is 4*3*sqrt(21)=12 sqrt(21)\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*12 sqrt(21)=6 sqrt(21)\n\nSimilarly, let's check another face, say ABD.\n\nPoints A(5/2,2,4), B(-5/2,-2,4), D(-5/2,2,-4)\n\nCompute vectors AB and AD.\n\nAB is same as before: (-5, -4, 0)\nAD: from A to D: (-5, 0, -8)\n\nCross product AB \u00d7 AD:\n\nAB = (-5, -4, 0)\nAD = (-5, 0, -8)\n\nCross product:\n\n|i    j     k|\n|-5   -4    0|\n|-5    0   -8|\n\n= i [ (-4)(-8) - (0)(0) ] - j [ (-5)(-8) - (0)(-5) ] + k [ (-5)(0) - (-4)(-5) ]\n\n= i [32 - 0] - j [40 - 0] + k [0 -20]\n\n=32i -40j -20k\n\nMagnitude: sqrt(32\u00b2 + (-40)^2 + (-20)^2) = sqrt(1024 +1600 +400)=sqrt(3024)= same as before, 12 sqrt(21)\n\nSo area is (1/2)*12 sqrt(21)=6 sqrt(21). So same as ABC.\n\nSimilarly, for face ACD and BCD, I can check, but I think all four faces have the same area.\n\nTherefore, the total surface area S = 4 *6 sqrt(21)=24 sqrt(21)\n\nSo, total surface area is 24 sqrt(21)\n\nNow, recall that the volume V is (1/3)*r*S, where r is the inradius.\n\nSo, V = (1/3)*r*S => 160/3 = (1/3)*r*(24 sqrt(21))\n\nSimplify:\n\nMultiply both sides by 3: 160 = r *24 sqrt(21)\n\nSo, solve for r: r = 160 / (24 sqrt(21)) = (160 \u00f7 8 ) / (24 \u00f78 sqrt(21)) => 20 / (3 sqrt(21)).",
