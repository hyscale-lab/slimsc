          "text1": "Wait, 1/2 + 1/3 is indeed 5/6, and then I have -2c = 5/6, so c = -5/(12).

Let's plug C = -5/12 into equation (1) and equation (2).\n\nEquation (1): A - B - (-5/12) = 1/2 \u2192 A - B + 5/12 = 1/2\n\nSo, A - B = 1/2 - 5/12.\n\n1/2 is 6/12, so 6/12 -5/12 = 1/12.\n\nSo, A - B = 1/12. Let's call this equation (4).\n\nEquation (2): -A + B - (-5/12) = 1/3 \u2192 -A + B +5/12 = 1/3\n\nSo, -A + B = 1/3 -5/12.\n\n1/3 is 4/12, so 4/12 -5/12 = -1/12.\n\nSo, -A + B = -1/12.

Hmm, that's not helpful. It means the equations are dependent.\n\nSo, let's try subtracting equations or another approach. Maybe plug into equation (3).\n\nEquation (3): -A - B + C = 1/4\n\nWe know C is -5/12, so:\n\n-A - B -5/12 = 1/4\n\nSo, -A - B = 1/4 +5/12.\n\n1/4 is 3/12, so 3/12 +5/12 =8/12= 2/3.\n\nSo, -A - B = 2/3 \u2192 A + B = -2/3.\n\nSo, equation (6): A + B = -2/3.\n\nNow, from equation (4): A - B = 1/12\n\nEquation (6): A + B = -2/3\n\nI can solve these two equations.\n\nLet me add equations (4) and (6):\n\n(A - B) + (A + B) = 1/12 + (-2/3)\n\nSimplify:\n\n2A = 1/12 - 8/12 = (-7)/12.\n\nSo, 2A = -7/12 \u2192 A = (-7)/24.\n\nThen, from equation (4): A - B = 1/12.\n\nWe know A is -7/24, so:\n\n-7/24 - B = 1/12 \u2192 -B = 1/12 +7/24.\n\nConvert 1/12 to 2/24, so 2/24 +7/24 =9/24=3/8.\n\nSo, -B = 3/8 \u2192 B = -3/8.\n\nSo, now I have A = -7/24, B = -3/8, C = -5/12.\n\nLet me confirm these with equation (3):\n\nEquation (3): -A - B + C = ?\n\n-A is 7/24, -B is 3/8, C is -5/12.\n\n7/24 +3/8 -5/12.\n\nConvert all to 24 denominators:\n\n7/24 + (3/8)*(3/3)=9/24 + (-5/12)*(2/2)= -10/24.\n\nSo, 7 +9 -10 =6 \u2192 6/24=1/4. Which matches equation (3). Good.\n\nAnd equation (2): -A + B - C.\n\n-A is 7/24, B is -3/8, -C is 5/12.\n\n7/24 -3/8 +5/12.\n\nConvert to 24 denominators:\n\n7/24 -9/24 +10/24= (7-9+10)/24=8/24=1/3. Which is correct.\n\nEquation (1): A - B - C.\n\nA is -7/24, -B is 3/8, -C is 5/12.\n\nSo, (-7/24) +3/8 +5/12.\n\nConvert to 24:\n\n-7/24 +9/24 +10/24=12/24=1/2.

The absolute value makes it 25/8.\n\nSo, |log\u2082(x^4 y^3 z^2)|=25/8.\n\nSo, m is 25, n is 8. They are coprime.\n\nTherefore, m +n=25+8=33.\n\nI think that's the answer.

Let's plug C = -5/12 into equation (1) and equation (2).\n\nEquation (1): A - B - (-5/12) = 1/2 \u2192 A - B + 5/12 = 1/2\n\nSo, A - B = 1/2 - 5/12.\n\n1/2 is 6/12, so 6/12 -5/12 = 1/12.\n\nSo, A - B = 1/12. Let's call this equation (4).\n\nEquation (2): -A + B - (-5/12) = 1/3 \u2192 -A + B +5/12 = 1/3\n\nSo, -A + B = 1/3 -5/12.\n\n1/3 is 4/12, so 4/12 -5/12 = -1/12.\n\nSo, -A + B = -1/12. Let's call this equation (5).\n\nNow, we have equation (4): A - B = 1/12\n\nand equation (5): -A + B = -1/12\n\nHmm, if I add equations (4) and (5):\n\n(A - B) + (-A + B) = 1/12 + (-1/12)\n\nSimplifies to 0 = 0. Hmm, that's not helpful. It means the equations are dependent.\n\nSo, let's try subtracting equations or another approach. Maybe plug into equation (3).\n\nEquation (3): -A - B + C = 1/4\n\nWe know C is -5/12, so:\n\n-A - B -5/12 = 1/4\n\nSo, -A - B = 1/4 +5/12.\n\n1/4 is 3/12, so 3/12 +5/12 =8/12= 2/3.\n\nSo, -A - B = 2/3 \u2192 A + B = -2/3.\n\nSo, equation (6): A + B = -2/3.\n\nNow, from equation (4): A - B = 1/12\n\nEquation (6): A + B = -2/3\n\nI can solve these two equations.\n\nLet me add equations (4) and (6):\n\n(A - B) + (A + B) = 1/12 + (-2/3)\n\nSimplify:\n\n2A = 1/12 - 8/12 = (-7)/12.\n\nSo, 2A = -7/12 \u2192 A = (-7)/24.\n\nThen, from equation (4): A - B = 1/12.\n\nWe know A is -7/24, so:\n\n-7/24 - B = 1/12 \u2192 -B = 1/12 +7/24.\n\nConvert 1/12 to 2/24, so 2/24 +7/24 =9/24=3/8.\n\nSo, -B = 3/8 \u2192 B = -3/8.\n\nSo, now I have A = -7/24, B = -3/8, C = -5/12.\n\nLet me confirm these with equation (3):\n\nEquation (3): -A - B + C = ?\n\n-A is 7/24, -B is 3/8, C is -5/12.\n\n7/24 +3/8 -5/12.\n\nConvert all to 24 denominators:\n\n7/24 + (3/8)*(3/3)=9/24 + (-5/12)*(2/2)= -10/24.\n\nSo, 7 +9 -10 =6 \u2192 6/24=1/4. Which matches equation (3). Good.\n\nAnd equation (2): -A + B - C.\n\n-A is 7/24, B is -3/8, -C is 5/12.\n\n7/24 -3/8 +5/12.\n\nConvert to 24 denominators:\n\n7/24 -9/24 +10/24= (7-9+10)/24=8/24=1/3.
