But since the median is an integer not in the list, that can't be the case because when n is odd, the median is one of the elements. So n must be even. So n is even, say n=2m.\n\nThen the median is the average of the mth and (m+1)th terms. So the median is (a_m + a_{m+1}) / 2, which is an integer not present in the list.\n\nSo let's think about possible even values of n.
