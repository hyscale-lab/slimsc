Yes, that's a standard formula. \n\nSimilarly, IB = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - b)\u00b2), IC = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - c)^2). \n\nIn our case, IA is given as 2*sqrt(39). So, IA = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2) = sqrt(6\u00b2 + (s - a)^2) = sqrt(36 + (s - a)^2) = 2*sqrt(39). \n\nSo, squaring both sides: 36 + (s - a)^2 = 4*39 = 156  \n=> (s - a)^2 = 156 - 36 = 120  \n=> s - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30)  \nBut s is (a + b + c)/2, so s - a = (-a + b + c)/2. \n\nSo, (-a + b + c)/2 = 2*sqrt(30)  \n=> (-a + b + c) = 4*sqrt(30)  \nSo, equation (1): -a + b + c = 4*sqrt(30)\n\nSo, that's one equation relating a, b, c. \n\nWe also have from earlier: a*b*c = 156*(a + b + c)  \nEquation (2): a*b*c = 156*(a + b + c)\n\nHmm, two equations. I need more relations. Perhaps using the circumradius formula. \n\nWe know R = 13 = (a*b*c)/(4*area). So, from area = (a*b*c)/(4*13). Also, area = 3*(a + b + c). So, 3*(a + b + c) = (a*b*c)/(4*13)  \nWhich gives (a*b*c) = 3*4*13*(a + b + c) = 156*(a + b + c), which is the same as equation (2). So, that's consistent. \n\nSo, probably need another relation.

Let me check that formula.\n\nYes, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by IA = r / sin(A/2).\n\nSo, if IA = 2\u221a39, and r =6, then:\n\n2\u221a39 = 6 / sin(A/2) => sin(A/2) = 6 / (2\u221a39) = 3 / \u221a39 = \u221a39 / 13.",
          "text2": "Wait, let me make sure. The formula for the distance from the incenter to vertex A is indeed AI = r / sin(A/2). Because in the triangle formed by the inradius and the angle bisector, you can relate AI with r and the half-angle.\n\nSo, AI = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2). But we found AI to be 2*sqrt(39). So,\n\n6 / sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39)\n=> sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13",
