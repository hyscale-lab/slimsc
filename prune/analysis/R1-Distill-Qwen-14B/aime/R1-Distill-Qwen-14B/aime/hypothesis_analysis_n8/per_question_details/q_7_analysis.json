Rotating B by 90\u00b0 clockwise would move each vertex to the next one, so v1\u2192v2, v2\u2192v3, etc., so B would become {v5, v6, v7, v8}, which is R. So, rotation by 90\u00b0 sends B to R. Similarly, rotating R by 90\u00b0 would send it to {v9, v10, v11, v12}, but since it's an octagon, v9 is v1, so R rotated by 90\u00b0 is {v1, v2, v3, v4}, which is B. So, in this case, B and R are images of each other under rotation by 90\u00b0, which is order 4.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that only rotations of order 2 could satisfy the condition because applying the rotation twice would have to send B to R and R back to B.
