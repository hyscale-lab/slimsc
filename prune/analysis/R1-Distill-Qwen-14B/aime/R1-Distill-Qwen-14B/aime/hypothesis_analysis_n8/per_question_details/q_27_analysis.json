Let's see if this lies on both surfaces.\n\nSphere: 0\u00b2 + 0\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 121 => z = \u00b111.\n\nTorus: ((0 - 6)^2) + (z - d)^2 = 9 => 36 + (z - d)^2 = 9 => (z - d)^2 = -27, which is impossible. So, no solution in this case.\n\nCase 2: \u03bb (r - 6)/r = 1.\n\nSo, \u03bb = r / (r - 6).\n\nNow, from the third equation:\n\nz = \u03bb (z - d ) = [ r / (r - 6) ] (z - d )\n\nSo,\n\nz (r - 6) = r (z - d )\n\nExpanding,\n\nz r - 6 z = r z - r d\n\nSimplify:\n\n-6 z = - r d\n\nSo,\n\n6 z = r d\n\nSo,\n\nz = (r d)/6\n\nNow, we also have the points lying on both surfaces.\n\nSphere: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 121.\n\nTorus: (r - 6)^2 + (z - d)^2 = 9.\n\nBut r = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), and from the sphere equation, r\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 121.\n\nFrom the torus equation: (r - 6)^2 + (z - d)^2 = 9.\n\nLet me expand the torus equation:\n\n(r\u00b2 - 12 r + 36) + (z\u00b2 - 2 d z + d\u00b2) = 9\n\nSo,\n\nr\u00b2 + z\u00b2 -12 r - 2 d z + 36 + d\u00b2 = 9\n\nBut from the sphere equation, r\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 121. Substitute that into the torus equation:\n\n121 -12 r - 2 d z + 36 + d\u00b2 = 9\n\nSimplify:\n\n(121 + 36 + d\u00b2) -12 r - 2 d z = 9\n\nSo,\n\n157 + d\u00b2 -12 r - 2 d z = 9\n\nThen,\n\nd\u00b2 -12 r - 2 d z = -148\n\nFrom earlier, we have z = (r d)/6.\n\nLet me substitute z into the equation:\n\nd\u00b2 -12 r - 2 d (r d /6 ) = -148\n\nSimplify:\n\nd\u00b2 -12 r - (2 d^2 r)/6 = -148\n\nSimplify the term (2 d\u00b2 r)/6 = (d\u00b2 r)/3.\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2 -12 r - (d\u00b2 r)/3 = -148\n\nLet me factor out r:\n\nd\u00b2 - r (12 + d\u00b2 /3 ) = -148\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nd\u00b2 + 148 = r (12 + d\u00b2 /3 )\n\nSo,\n\nr = (d\u00b2 + 148) / (12 + d\u00b2 /3 )\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 3 to eliminate the fraction:\n\nr = (3 d\u00b2 + 444) / (36 + d\u00b2 )\n\nSo, that's an expression for r in terms of d.\n\nBut we also have that from the sphere equation: r\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 121, and z = (r d)/6.\n\nSo, substitute z into the sphere equation:\n\nr\u00b2 + ( (r d)/6 )\u00b2 = 121\n\nSo,\n\nr\u00b2 + (r\u00b2 d\u00b2)/36 = 121\n\nFactor out r\u00b2:\n\nr\u00b2 (1 + d\u00b2 /36 ) = 121\n\nSo,\n\nr\u00b2 = 121 / (1 + d\u00b2 /36 ) = (121 * 36) / (36 + d\u00b2 ) = 4356 / (36 + d\u00b2 )\n\nBut from earlier, r = (3 d\u00b2 + 444) / (36 + d\u00b2 )\n\nSo, square both sides:\n\nr\u00b2 = [ (3 d\u00b2 + 444)^2 ] / (36 + d\u00b2 )^2\n\nSet this equal to 4356 / (36 + d\u00b2 )\n\nSo,\n\n[ (3 d\u00b2 + 444)^2 ] / (36 + d\u00b2 )^2 = 4356 / (36 + d\u00b2 )\n\nMultiply both sides by (36 + d\u00b2 )^2:\n\n(3 d\u00b2 + 444)^2 = 4356 (36 + d\u00b2 )\n\nLet me compute (3 d\u00b2 + 444)^2:\n\n= 9 d^4 + 2*3*444 d\u00b2 + 444^2\n\n= 9 d^4 + 2664 d\u00b2 + 197136\n\nAnd 4356 (36 + d\u00b2 ) = 4356*36 + 4356 d\u00b2\n\nCompute 4356 *36:\n\n4356 *36: Let me compute 4356 * 30 = 130,680; 4356 *6=26,136. So total is 130,680 +26,136=156,816.\n\nSo, 4356 (36 + d\u00b2 )=156,816 +4356 d\u00b2.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n9 d^4 + 2664 d\u00b2 + 197136 =156,816 +4356 d\u00b2\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n9 d^4 +2664 d\u00b2 +197136 -156,816 -4356 d\u00b2 =0\n\nSimplify:\n\n9 d^4 + (2664 -4356) d\u00b2 + (197136 -156816)=0\n\nCompute coefficients:\n\n2664 -4356 = -1692.\n\n197136 -156816 =40,320.\n\nSo,\n\n9 d^4 -1692 d\u00b2 +40320 =0.\n\nDivide all terms by 3 to simplify:\n\n3 d^4 -564 d\u00b2 +13440 =0.\n\nHmm, still a bit complicated. Let me let u = d\u00b2.\n\nThen the equation becomes:\n\n3 u\u00b2 -564 u +13440 =0.\n\nDivide all terms by 3:\n\nu\u00b2 -188 u +4480 =0.\n\nNow, solve for u using quadratic formula.\n\nu = [188 \u00b1 sqrt(188\u00b2 -4*1*4480)] / 2.\n\nCompute discriminant D:\n\n188\u00b2 = (200 -12)^2 = 200\u00b2 -2*200*12 +12\u00b2 =40000 -4800 +144= 40000-4800=35200 +144=35344.\n\n4*1*4480=17920.\n\nSo, D=35344 -17920=17424.\n\nsqrt(17424)=132, since 132^2=17,424.\n\nSo, u=(188 \u00b1132)/2.\n\nCompute the two roots:\n\nu1=(188+132)/2=320/2=160.\n\nu2=(188-132)/2=56/2=28.\n\nSo, u=160 or u=28.\n\nSince u=d\u00b2, d\u00b2=160 or d\u00b2=28.\n\nSo, d=\u00b1sqrt(160)=\u00b14 sqrt(10), or d=\u00b1sqrt(28)=\u00b12 sqrt(7).\n\nSo, we have four possible solutions for d: 4\u221a10, -4\u221a10, 2\u221a7, -2\u221a7.\n\nNow, we need to determine which of these correspond to internal and external tangency.\n\nWhen the torus is inside the sphere, the center of the torus is closer to the origin. So, d would be smaller. When it's outside, d would be larger.\n\nLet me check the possible d values:\n\nsqrt(160)= approx 12.649,\n\nsqrt(28)= approx 5.291.\n\nSo, d=4 sqrt(10)\u224812.649, which is larger than d=2 sqrt(7)\u22485.291.\n\nSo, likely, d=4 sqrt(10) is for external tangency, and d=2 sqrt(7) is for internal tangency.",
