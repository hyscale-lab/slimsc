          "text1": "Wait, that's a key insight. Because each of the expressions 1000*(1 - a), 100*(1 - b), 10*(1 - c), and (1 - d) must all be congruent to -N mod 7.\n\nSo, 1000*(1 - a) \u2261 100*(1 - b) \u2261 10*(1 - c) \u2261 (1 - d) mod 7\n\nTherefore, each of these four expressions must be congruent to each other modulo 7.\n\nSo, let me compute each coefficient modulo 7 first, since 1000, 100, 10, etc., have known values mod 7.\n\nLet me compute:\n\n1000 mod 7: Let's compute 1000 / 7. 7*142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So 1000 \u2261 6 mod 7.\n\n100 mod 7: 7*14 = 98, so 100 - 98 = 2. So 100 \u2261 2 mod 7.\n\n10 mod 7 = 3, because 10 - 7 = 3.\n\nAnd 1 mod 7 is 1.\n\nSo, rewriting the four congruences:\n\n1. 6*(1 - a) \u2261 -N mod 7\n2. 2*(1 - b) \u2261 -N mod 7\n3. 3*(1 - c) \u2261 -N mod 7\n4. 1*(1 - d) \u2261 -N mod 7\n\nSo all four expressions on the left must be congruent modulo 7. Therefore:\n\n6*(1 - a) \u2261 2*(1 - b) \u2261 3*(1 - c) \u2261 (1 - d) mod 7\n\nSo, let me denote K = -N mod 7. So all four expressions are equal to K mod 7.\n\nSo,\n\n1. 6*(1 - a) \u2261 K mod 7\n2. 2*(1 - b) \u2261 K mod 7\n3. 3*(1 - c) \u2261 K mod 7\n4.

(1 - d) \u2261 K mod 7 \u2192 d \u2261 (1 - K) mod 7\n\nSo, from each equation, we can express a, b, c, d in terms of K.\n\nLet me solve each equation for a, b, c, d.\n\n1. 6a \u2261 (6 - K) mod 7\nSince 6 and 7 are coprime, 6 has an inverse modulo 7. The inverse of 6 mod 7 is 6, because 6*6 = 36 \u2261 1 mod 7. So, multiplying both sides by 6:\n\na \u2261 6*(6 - K) mod 7 \u2192 a \u2261 (36 - 6K) mod 7 \u2192 Since 36 mod 7 is 1 (because 7*5=35, 36-35=1), so a \u2261 (1 - 6K) mod 7.\n\n2. 2b \u2261 (2 - K) mod 7\nThe inverse of 2 mod 7 is 4, since 2*4=8\u22611 mod7. So, multiply both sides by 4:\n\nb \u2261 4*(2 - K) mod7 \u2192 b \u2261 (8 - 4K) mod7 \u2192 8 mod7 is 1, so b \u2261 (1 - 4K) mod7.\n\n3. 3c \u2261 (3 - K) mod7\nInverse of 3 mod7 is 5, since 3*5=15\u22611 mod7. Multiply both sides by 5:\n\nc \u2261 5*(3 - K) mod7 \u2192 c \u2261 (15 -5K) mod7 \u2192 15 mod7 is 1, so c \u2261 (1 -5K) mod7.\n\n4. d \u2261 (1 - K) mod7.\n\nSo, now we have:\n\na \u2261 (1 -6K) mod7\n\nb \u2261 (1 -4K) mod7\n\nc \u2261 (1 -5K) mod7\n\nd \u2261 (1 - K) mod7\n\nSince a, b, c, d are digits (0-9), and K is an integer mod7, which can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nGiven that N is the greatest four-digit number, we want N to be as large as possible, so we should aim for a=9, b=9, c=9, d=9, but adjusted to satisfy the above congruences.",

But N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. So, N - 1BCD = 1000(A - 1). Thus, N \u2261 1BCD mod 7. But 1BCD is divisible by 7, so N \u2261 0 mod 7.\n\nSo, N must be divisible by 7.\n\nSimilarly, let's look at the other conditions.\n\nWhen replacing B with 1: A1CD.

But N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. So, N - 1BCD = 1000(A - 1). Thus, N \u2261 1BCD mod 7. But 1BCD is divisible by 7, so N \u2261 0 mod 7.\n\nSo, N must be divisible by 7.\n\nSimilarly, let's look at the other conditions.\n\nWhen replacing B with 1: A1CD.

Since A1CD is divisible by 7, N \u2261 0 mod 7.\n\nSame goes for replacing C with 1: AB1D. So, AB1D is 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D. N - AB1D = 10(C - 1). So, N \u2261 AB1D mod 7, which is 0. Hence, N \u2261 0 mod 7.\n\nSimilarly, replacing D with 1: ABC1. So, ABC1 is 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1. N - ABC1 = D - 1. So, N \u2261 ABC1 mod 7, which is 0. Hence, N \u2261 0 mod 7.\n\nSo, from all four conditions, N must be divisible by 7. That's a key point.\n\nBut that's just one condition.

But N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. So, N - 1BCD = 1000(A - 1). Thus, N \u2261 1BCD mod 7. But 1BCD is divisible by 7, so N \u2261 0 mod 7.\n\nSo, N must be divisible by 7.\n\nSimilarly, let's look at the other conditions.\n\nWhen replacing B with 1: A1CD.

Since A1CD is divisible by 7, N \u2261 0 mod 7.\n\nSame goes for replacing C with 1: AB1D. So, AB1D is 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D. N - AB1D = 10(C - 1). So, N \u2261 AB1D mod 7, which is 0. Hence, N \u2261 0 mod 7.\n\nSimilarly, replacing D with 1: ABC1. So, ABC1 is 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1. N - ABC1 = D - 1. So, N \u2261 ABC1 mod 7, which is 0. Hence, N \u2261 0 mod 7.\n\nSo, from all four conditions, N must be divisible by 7. That's a key point.\n\nBut that's just one condition.

Since A1CD is divisible by 7, N \u2261 0 mod 7.\n\nSame goes for replacing C with 1: AB1D. So, AB1D is 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D. N - AB1D = 10(C - 1). So, N \u2261 AB1D mod 7, which is 0. Hence, N \u2261 0 mod 7.\n\nSimilarly, replacing D with 1: ABC1. So, ABC1 is 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1. N - ABC1 = D - 1. So, N \u2261 ABC1 mod 7, which is 0. Hence, N \u2261 0 mod 7.\n\nSo, from all four conditions, N must be divisible by 7. That's a key point.\n\nBut that's just one condition. The other conditions are about what happens when you replace each digit with 1. So, N is divisible by 7, but also, when you change any single digit to 1, the number becomes divisible by 7.",

Let me think differently.\n\nFrom equation (a): B = 3A -2 +7k, where k is an integer such that B is between 0 and 9.\n\nSo, let's find possible B for each A.\n\nBut since A is from 9 downwards, perhaps I can start with A=9 and work down.\n\nLet me try A=9.\n\nA=9.\n\nThen, from equation (a): B \u22613*9 -2=27-2=25 mod7.\n\n25 mod7 is 25-3*7=25-21=4. So, B \u22614 mod7.\n\nSo, B can be 4 or 11, but since B is a digit, B=4.\n\nSo, B=4.\n\nNow, from equation (b): 2B -3C \u22616 mod7.\n\nSubstituting B=4: 2*4 -3C \u22616 mod7 => 8 -3C \u22616 mod7.\n\n8 mod7=1, 6 mod7=6.\n\nSo, 1 -3C \u22616 mod7 => -3C \u22615 mod7 => 3C \u2261-5 mod7 => 3C\u22612 mod7 (since -5=2 mod7).\n\nSo, 3C\u22612 mod7. Multiply both sides by inverse of 3 mod7. The inverse of 3 mod7 is 5 because 3*5=15\u22611 mod7.\n\nSo, C\u22612*5=10\u22613 mod7.\n\nSo, C=3 or 10, but since C is a digit, C=3.\n\nSo, C=3.\n\nFrom equation (c): 3C - D \u22612 mod7.\n\nSubstituting C=3: 9 - D \u22612 mod7.\n\n9 mod7=2, so 2 - D \u22612 mod7 => -D \u22610 mod7 => D\u22610 mod7.\n\nSo, D=0 or 7. Since D is a digit, D can be 0 or7.\n\nSo, D is 0 or7.\n\nNow, let me check N=9 4 3 D, where D is 0 or7. Since we want the largest possible N, let's try D=7. So, N=9437.",

So, Equation (6) doesn't provide new information beyond Equations (5) and (9). So, perhaps that's why we have multiple variables.\n\nHmm, maybe I should proceed to express D in terms of A.\n\nFrom Equation (7): D \u22616A -5 mod7.\n\nSo, D can be written as D =6A -5 +7n, where n is integer such that D is a digit (0 \u2264 D \u22649).\n\nSo, D is determined once A is known.\n\nSimilarly, from Equation (8): D \u22612B -1 mod7.\n\nBut since B is expressed in terms of A (from Equation (9)), let's substitute:\n\nEquation (8): D \u22612*(3A -2 +7k) -1 mod7.\n\nCompute:\n\n2*(3A) -2*2 +2*7k -1 =6A -4 +14k -1 =6A -5 +14k.\n\nSo, D \u22616A -5 +14k mod7.\n\nBut 14k \u22610 mod7, so D \u22616A -5 mod7, which matches Equation (7). So, again, no new info.\n\nSo, in summary:\n\nB =3A -2 +7k\n\nC=2A -1 +7m\n\nD=6A -5 +7n\n\nwhere k, m, n are integers such that B, C, D are digits (0-9).\n\nOur aim is to find the largest possible N=ABCD.\n\nSince we're looking for the largest N, we should try A=9 first, then A=8, etc., until we find a valid N.\n\nLet's start with A=9.\n\nCase 1: A=9.\n\nCompute B, C, D in terms of k, m, n.\n\nFrom B=3*9 -2 +7k=27-2 +7k=25 +7k.\n\nBut B must be a digit (0-9). So, 25 +7k \u22649 --> 7k \u2264 -16. But 7k is a multiple of 7, so 7k can be -21, -14, etc. Let's see:\n\nIf k=-4: 25 +7*(-4)=25-28=-3, which is invalid (B can't be negative).\n\nk=-3: 25-21=4, which is valid. So, B=4.",
