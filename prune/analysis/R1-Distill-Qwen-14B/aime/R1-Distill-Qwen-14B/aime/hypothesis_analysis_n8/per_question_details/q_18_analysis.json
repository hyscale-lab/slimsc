The angle between two lines with angles \u03b81 and \u03b82 is |\u03b82 - \u03b81|. So, if two diagonals have central angles \u03b81 and \u03b82, the angle between them is |\u03b82 - \u03b81|. So, to have the angle between them be 90\u00b0, we need |\u03b82 - \u03b81| = 90\u00b0, or 270\u00b0, but since we're dealing with a 12-gon, 270\u00b0 is equivalent to -90\u00b0, which is the same as 90\u00b0 in terms of angle between lines.\n\nSo, the angle between two diagonals is 90\u00b0 if the difference between their central angles is 90\u00b0. So, if one diagonal has step m, central angle 30m, and another has step n, central angle 30n, then |30n - 30m| should be 90\u00b0, which simplifies to |n - m| = 3.

For example, a diagonal with step 1 and another with step 4 would have central angles 30\u00b0 and 120\u00b0, so the angle between them is 90\u00b0, making them perpendicular. Similarly, step 2 and step 5, step 3 and step 6, etc.\n\nSo, now, for a rectangle, we need two pairs of such perpendicular diagonals.

In a regular polygon, the central angle between two vertices is given by (360/n)*k, where n is the number of sides, and k is the step size. For a dodecagon, n=12, so the central angle between two vertices separated by step size k is (360/12)*k = 30k degrees.\n\nNow, for two diagonals with step sizes k and m to be perpendicular, the angle between them should be 90 degrees. The angle between two diagonals can be calculated based on their central angles.
