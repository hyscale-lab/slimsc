Let me try that.\n\nLet me set point A at (x, y, z), and then see if I can assign coordinates to the other points based on the edge lengths. But that might require a lot of variables.",
          "text2": "Alternatively, perhaps I can place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system to make calculations easier.\n\nLet me try that approach. Let's assign coordinates to the vertices in such a way that simplifies the calculations.\n\nLet me denote the points as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s place point A at (0, 0, 0).\n\nThen, let me place point B at (x, 0, 0), so that AB lies along the x-axis. The length AB is sqrt(41), so the distance between A(0,0,0) and B(x,0,0) is |x| = sqrt(41). So x = sqrt(41). So, B is at (sqrt(41), 0, 0).\n\nNext, let's place point C in the xy-plane. Let\u2019s denote the coordinates as (a, b, 0). Then, AC has length sqrt(80) and BC has length sqrt(89). So, the distance from A to C is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = sqrt(80), so a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 80. The distance from B to C is sqrt( (a - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + b\u00b2 ) = sqrt(89). So, (a - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 89.\n\nLet me write down these equations:\n\n1. a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 80\n2. (a - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 89\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(a - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 89 - 80\n\nExpand (a - sqrt(41))\u00b2: a\u00b2 - 2*a*sqrt(41) + 41\n\nSo, equation 2 - equation 1 gives:\n\na\u00b2 - 2a*sqrt(41) + 41 + b\u00b2 - a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 9\n\nSimplify:\n\n-2a*sqrt(41) + 41 = 9\n\nSo, -2a*sqrt(41) = 9 - 41 = -32\n\nThus, 2a*sqrt(41) = 32 => a = 32 / (2*sqrt(41)) = 16 / sqrt(41)\n\nRationalizing the denominator: a = (16*sqrt(41)) / 41\n\nSo, a = (16 sqrt41)/41\n\nNow, from equation 1: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 80\n\nCompute a\u00b2: (16 sqrt41 /41)^2 = (256 * 41) / (41^2) )= 256 /41\n\nSo, 256/41 + b\u00b2 = 80\n\nCompute 80 as 80*41/41 = 3280/41\n\nSo, b\u00b2 = 3280/41 -256/41 = (3280 -256)/41 = 3024 /41\n\nSo, b = sqrt(3024/41) = sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41)\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024). Let's factor 3024.\n\n3024 \u00f7 16 = 189, so 3024 = 16 * 189.\n\n189 = 9 * 21 = 9 * 3 *7. So, 3024 = 16 *9 *3 *7 = 16*9*21.\n\nSo, sqrt(3024) = sqrt(16*9*21) = 4*3*sqrt(21) =12 sqrt21.\n\nThus, b = 12 sqrt21 / sqrt41. Rationalizing:\n\nb = (12 sqrt21 * sqrt41)/41 = 12 sqrt(21*41)/41.",

So, b =12 sqrt21 / sqrt41.\n\nSo, C is at (16 sqrt41 /41, 12 sqrt21 / sqrt41, 0 )\n\nHmm, that's pretty messy, but okay.\n\nNow, let's place point D.

Now, point D is such that AD = sqrt89, BD = sqrt80, and CD=sqrt41.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates of D as (p, q, r). Since we need to find D in 3D space, we can set up equations based on the distances.\n\nFirst, AD = sqrt89: distance from A(0,0,0) to D(p,q,r) is sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2) = sqrt89. So, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 =89.\n\nSecond, BD = sqrt80: distance from B(sqrt41,0,0) to D(p,q,r) is sqrt( (p - sqrt41)^2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 )=sqrt80. So, (p - sqrt41)^2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 =80.\n\nThird, CD = sqrt41: distance from C( (16 sqrt41)/41, (12 sqrt21)/sqrt41, 0 ) to D(p,q,r) is sqrt( (p - 16 sqrt41/41)^2 + (q - 12 sqrt21/sqrt41)^2 + (r - 0)^2 )=sqrt41. So, (p -16 sqrt41/41)^2 + (q -12 sqrt21/sqrt41)^2 + r\u00b2 =41.\n\nSo, now we have three equations:\n\n1. p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 =89  (Equation A)\n\n2.

(Equation D)\n\nNow, let's work on equation C:\n\n(p -16 sqrt41/41)^2 + (q -12 sqrt21/sqrt41)^2 + r\u00b2=41.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: p -16 sqrt41/41.

So, the coordinates of the tetrahedron's vertices can be placed at the vertices of the cuboid.\n\nLet me assume that the cuboid is placed with one corner at the origin (0,0,0). Then, the opposite corner will be at (4,5,8). The tetrahedron's vertices can be placed as follows:\n\nA = (0,0,0)\nB = (4,5,0)\nC = (4,0,8)\nD = (0,5,8)",

So, b =12 sqrt21 / sqrt41.\n\nSo, C is at (16 sqrt41 /41, 12 sqrt21 / sqrt41, 0 )\n\nHmm, that's pretty messy, but okay.\n\nNow, let's place point D. Since the tetrahedron has edge lengths AB=CD=sqrt41, AC=BD=sqrt80, and BC=AD=sqrt89.\n\nWe have points A, B, C. Now, point D is such that AD = sqrt89, BD = sqrt80, and CD=sqrt41.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates of D as (p, q, r). Since we need to find D in 3D space, we can set up equations based on the distances.\n\nFirst, AD = sqrt89: distance from A(0,0,0) to D(p,q,r) is sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2) = sqrt89. So, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 =89.\n\nSecond, BD = sqrt80: distance from B(sqrt41,0,0) to D(p,q,r) is sqrt( (p - sqrt41)^2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 )=sqrt80. So, (p - sqrt41)^2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 =80.\n\nThird, CD = sqrt41: distance from C( (16 sqrt41)/41, (12 sqrt21)/sqrt41, 0 ) to D(p,q,r) is sqrt( (p - 16 sqrt41/41)^2 + (q - 12 sqrt21/sqrt41)^2 + (r - 0)^2 )=sqrt41. So, (p -16 sqrt41/41)^2 + (q -12 sqrt21/sqrt41)^2 + r\u00b2 =41.\n\nSo, now we have three equations:\n\n1. p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 =89  (Equation A)\n\n2. (p - sqrt41)^2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 =80  (Equation B)\n\n3.

(Equation D)\n\nNow, let's work on equation C:\n\n(p -16 sqrt41/41)^2 + (q -12 sqrt21/sqrt41)^2 + r\u00b2=41.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: p -16 sqrt41/41. Since p=25 sqrt41/41, so 25 sqrt41/41 -16 sqrt41/41=9 sqrt41/41.\n\nSo, (9 sqrt41/41)^2=81*41/(41^2)=81/41.\n\nSecond term: q -12 sqrt21/sqrt41. Let me denote this as (q - (12 sqrt21)/sqrt41). Squared, it is (q)^2 - (24 sqrt21/sqrt41) q + (144 *21)/41.\n\nSimplify: q\u00b2 - (24 sqrt21 / sqrt41) q + (3024)/41.\n\nThird term: r\u00b2.\n\nSo, equation C becomes:\n\n81/41 + [q\u00b2 - (24 sqrt21 / sqrt41) q +3024/41] + r\u00b2 =41.\n\nCombine terms:\n\n81/41 + q\u00b2 - (24 sqrt21 / sqrt41) q +3024/41 + r\u00b2 =41.\n\nFrom equation D, we know q\u00b2 + r\u00b2=3024/41. So, substituting that:\n\n81/41 + 3024/41 - (24 sqrt21 / sqrt41) q =41.\n\nCompute 81 +3024=3105, so 3105/41 - (24 sqrt21 / sqrt41) q =41.\n\nConvert 41 to 41/1, which is 41*41/41=1681/41.\n\nSo:\n\n3105/41 - (24 sqrt21 / sqrt41) q =1681/41.\n\nSubtract 1681/41 from both sides:\n\n(3105 -1681)/41 - (24 sqrt21 / sqrt41) q =0.\n\nCompute 3105 -1681=1424.\n\nSo, 1424/41 - (24 sqrt21 / sqrt41) q =0.\n\nThus,\n\n(24 sqrt21 / sqrt41) q =1424/41.\n\nSolve for q:\n\nq= (1424/41) / (24 sqrt21 / sqrt41) = (1424 /41 ) * (sqrt41 / (24 sqrt21)).\n\nSimplify:\n\n1424 \u00f7 24: 1424 /24= 59.333...",

Let me write these equations:\n\n1. a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41\n2. a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 80\n3. b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89\n\nNow, I can solve for a\u00b2, b\u00b2, c\u00b2.\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2: (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 80 - 41 => c\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 39.\n\nFrom equation 3: b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89.\n\nSo now, I have two equations:\n\nc\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 39\nc\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 89\n\nLet me add them:\n\n2c\u00b2 = 128 => c\u00b2=64 => c=8.\n\nSubtract them:\n\n2b\u00b2 = 50 => b\u00b2=25 => b=5.\n\nThen from equation 1: a\u00b2 + 25 =41 => a\u00b2=16 => a=4.\n\nSo, the cuboid has edges a=4, b=5, c=8.\n\nOkay, so now, the tetrahedron is formed by connecting the opposite face diagonals of this cuboid. So, the coordinates of the tetrahedron's vertices can be placed at the vertices of the cuboid.\n\nLet me assume that the cuboid is placed with one corner at the origin (0,0,0). Then, the opposite corner will be at (4,5,8). The tetrahedron's vertices can be placed as follows:\n\nA = (0,0,0)\nB = (4,5,0)\nC = (4,0,8)\nD = (0,5,8)",
          "text2": "Wait, 3024=16*189=16*9*21=16*9*3*7. So, sqrt(3024)=4*3*sqrt(3*7)=12 sqrt21. So, yeah, sqrt(3024)=12 sqrt21. So, b =12 sqrt21 / sqrt41.\n\nSo, C is at (16 sqrt41 /41, 12 sqrt21 / sqrt41, 0 )\n\nHmm, that's pretty messy, but okay.\n\nNow, let's place point D. Since the tetrahedron has edge lengths AB=CD=sqrt41, AC=BD=sqrt80, and BC=AD=sqrt89.\n\nWe have points A, B, C. Now, point D is such that AD = sqrt89, BD = sqrt80, and CD=sqrt41.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates of D as (p, q, r). Since we need to find D in 3D space, we can set up equations based on the distances.\n\nFirst, AD = sqrt89: distance from A(0,0,0) to D(p,q,r) is sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2) = sqrt89. So, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 =89.\n\nSecond, BD = sqrt80: distance from B(sqrt41,0,0) to D(p,q,r) is sqrt( (p - sqrt41)^2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 )=sqrt80. So, (p - sqrt41)^2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 =80.\n\nThird, CD = sqrt41: distance from C( (16 sqrt41)/41, (12 sqrt21)/sqrt41, 0 ) to D(p,q,r) is sqrt( (p - 16 sqrt41/41)^2 + (q - 12 sqrt21/sqrt41)^2 + (r - 0)^2 )=sqrt41. So, (p -16 sqrt41/41)^2 + (q -12 sqrt21/sqrt41)^2 + r\u00b2 =41.\n\nSo, now we have three equations:\n\n1. p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 =89  (Equation A)\n\n2. (p - sqrt41)^2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 =80  (Equation B)\n\n3. (p -16 sqrt41/41)^2 + (q -12 sqrt21/sqrt41)^2 + r\u00b2 =41  (Equation C)\n\nLet's subtract equation A from equation B:\n\nEquation B - Equation A:\n\n(p - sqrt41)^2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 - p\u00b2 - q\u00b2 - r\u00b2 =80 -89= -9\n\nExpanding (p - sqrt41)^2: p\u00b2 - 2 p sqrt41 +41\n\nSo, p\u00b2 - 2 p sqrt41 +41 - p\u00b2 = -9\n\nSimplify: -2 p sqrt41 +41 = -9\n\nSo, -2 p sqrt41 = -50\n\nDivide both sides by -2 sqrt41: p = (-50)/(-2 sqrt41) =25 / sqrt41.\n\nRationalizing: p =25 sqrt41 /41.\n\nSo, p =25 sqrt41 /41.\n\nNow, plug p back into equation A: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 =89.\n\nCompute p\u00b2: (25 sqrt41 /41)^2= (625 *41)/ (41^2)=625 /41.\n\nSo, 625/41 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 =89.\n\nConvert 89 to 41ths: 89 = (89*41)/41=3649/41.\n\nThus, q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 =3649/41 -625/41= (3649 -625)/41=3024/41.\n\nSo, q\u00b2 + r\u00b2=3024/41. (Equation D)\n\nNow, let's work on equation C:\n\n(p -16 sqrt41/41)^2 + (q -12 sqrt21/sqrt41)^2 + r\u00b2=41.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: p -16 sqrt41/41. Since p=25 sqrt41/41, so 25 sqrt41/41 -16 sqrt41/41=9 sqrt41/41.\n\nSo, (9 sqrt41/41)^2=81*41/(41^2)=81/41.\n\nSecond term: q -12 sqrt21/sqrt41. Let me denote this as (q - (12 sqrt21)/sqrt41). Squared, it is (q)^2 - (24 sqrt21/sqrt41) q + (144 *21)/41.\n\nSimplify: q\u00b2 - (24 sqrt21 / sqrt41) q + (3024)/41.\n\nThird term: r\u00b2.\n\nSo, equation C becomes:\n\n81/41 + [q\u00b2 - (24 sqrt21 / sqrt41) q +3024/41] + r\u00b2 =41.\n\nCombine terms:\n\n81/41 + q\u00b2 - (24 sqrt21 / sqrt41) q +3024/41 + r\u00b2 =41.\n\nFrom equation D, we know q\u00b2 + r\u00b2=3024/41. So, substituting that:\n\n81/41 + 3024/41 - (24 sqrt21 / sqrt41) q =41.\n\nCompute 81 +3024=3105, so 3105/41 - (24 sqrt21 / sqrt41) q =41.\n\nConvert 41 to 41/1, which is 41*41/41=1681/41.\n\nSo:\n\n3105/41 - (24 sqrt21 / sqrt41) q =1681/41.\n\nSubtract 1681/41 from both sides:\n\n(3105 -1681)/41 - (24 sqrt21 / sqrt41) q =0.\n\nCompute 3105 -1681=1424.\n\nSo, 1424/41 - (24 sqrt21 / sqrt41) q =0.\n\nThus,\n\n(24 sqrt21 / sqrt41) q =1424/41.\n\nSolve for q:\n\nq= (1424/41) / (24 sqrt21 / sqrt41) = (1424 /41 ) * (sqrt41 / (24 sqrt21)).\n\nSimplify:\n\n1424 \u00f7 24: 1424 /24= 59.333...",

Given AD = \u221a89, so 2\u221a(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = \u221a89 \u2192 \u221a(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = \u221a89 / 2 \u2192 b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nNow, I have three equations:\n\n1. a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41/4\n2. a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 20\n3. b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nI can solve these equations to find a\u00b2, b\u00b2, c\u00b2.\n\nLet me write them:\n\nEquation 1: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41/4\n\nEquation 2: a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 20\n\nEquation 3: b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nI can subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n\n(Equation 2 - Equation 1): (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 20 - 41/4\n\nSo, c\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (80/4 - 41/4) = 39/4\n\nBut from Equation 3, we have b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSo now, I have:\n\nc\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 39/4\n\nc\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nLet me add these two equations:\n\n(c\u00b2 - b\u00b2) + (c\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 39/4 + 89/4 \u2192 2c\u00b2 = 128/4 = 32 \u2192 c\u00b2 = 16 \u2192 c = 4 or c = -4. Since it's a coordinate, the sign doesn't matter, so let me take c = 4.\n\nNow, subtract the equations:\n\n(c\u00b2 + b\u00b2) - (c\u00b2 - b\u00b2) = 89/4 - 39/4 \u2192 2b\u00b2 = 50/4 = 25/2 \u2192 b\u00b2 = 25/4 \u2192 b = 5/2 or b = -5/2. Let's take b = 5/2.\n\nNow, from Equation 1: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41/4 \u2192 a\u00b2 + (25/4) = 41/4 \u2192 a\u00b2 = (41 -25)/4 = 16/4 = 4 \u2192 a = 2 or a = -2.

The length AB is sqrt(41), so the distance between A(0,0,0) and B(x,0,0) is |x| = sqrt(41). So x = sqrt(41). So, B is at (sqrt(41), 0, 0).\n\nNext, let's place point C in the xy-plane. Let\u2019s denote the coordinates as (a, b, 0). Then, AC has length sqrt(80) and BC has length sqrt(89). So, the distance from A to C is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = sqrt(80), so a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 80.
