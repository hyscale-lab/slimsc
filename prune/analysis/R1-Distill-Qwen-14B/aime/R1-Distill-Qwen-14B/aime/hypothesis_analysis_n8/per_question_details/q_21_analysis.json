So, if b\u00b2 -2b +1 \u2264 b\u00b2 -1, then subtracting, we get -2b +1 \u2264 -1 \u2192 -2b \u2264 -2 \u2192 2b \u22652 \u2192 b \u22651, which is always true since b \u22652.\n\nSo, for each s from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1, we can have possible s values, and for each s, we can try to see if there are digits d1 and d0 in base b such that d1 + d0 = s and d1*b + d0 = s\u00b2.\n\nSo, let's re-express the equation d1*b + d0 = s\u00b2. Since d1 + d0 = s, we can write d0 = s - d1. Substituting into the first equation:\n\nd1*b + (s - d1) = s\u00b2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nd1*b + s - d1 = s\u00b2 \u2192 d1*(b - 1) + s = s\u00b2 \u2192 d1*(b -1) = s\u00b2 - s.\n\nSo, d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1).\n\nSince d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, the numerator (s\u00b2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). So, (b -1) must divide (s\u00b2 - s).\n\nMoreover, d1 must satisfy 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b-1. So, let's write:\n\nd1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1).\n\nSo, for a given b, we can iterate through possible s values (from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1), compute d1, and check if it's an integer in the correct range. For each valid s, we can then compute d0 = s - d1 and check if d0 is a valid digit (i.e., 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b-1).\n\nBut we need to find, for each b, how many such pairs (d1, d0) exist, i.e., how many s satisfy these conditions.\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest b \u22652 such that the number of b-eautiful integers n is more than ten.\n\nSo, for each b, we need to count the number of s where:\n\n- s is integer, s \u2265 ceil(sqrt(b)), s \u2264 b-1.\n\n- (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b-1).\n\n- d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b-1) is integer, 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b-1.\n\n- d0 = s - d1 is between 0 and b-1.\n\nEach such s gives a unique n = s\u00b2, so each valid s corresponds to one b-eautiful integer n.\n\nHence, the number of b-eautiful integers is equal to the number of valid s values for that base b.\n\nSo, to find the minimal b where the count is >10.\n\nSo, the approach to solve this is:\n\n1. For each b starting from 2 upwards:\n\n   a. Compute the possible s range: s_min = ceil(sqrt(b)), s_max = b-1.\n\n   b. For each s in s_min to s_max:\n\n      i.

Check if 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b-1.\n\n      iv. If all conditions met, count this s as a valid case.\n\n   c.

For d0 from 2 to some upper limit:\n\n   a. Compute m = d0^2 - d0.\n\n   b. Find all divisors d1 of m.\n\n   c. For each d1:\n\n      i. Compute b = [ (d1 + d0)^2 - d0 ] / d1.\n\n      ii. Check if b is an integer (which it should be since d1 divides m).\n\n      iii. Check if d1 < b and d0 < b.\n\n         - Because d1 and d0 must be digits in base b.\n\n      iv. If so, increment the count for base b.\n\n2. After processing all d0 and d1 pairs, find the smallest b where the count exceeds 10.\n\nThis seems manageable. Let's try to compute for some d0's.\n\nLet me start with d0=2.\n\nd0=2:\n\nm = 2^2 -2 =4 -2=2.\n\nDivisors of 2 are 1,2.\n\nSo, d1 can be 1 or 2.\n\nFor each d1:\n\nCase 1: d1=1.\n\nCompute b:\n\nb = (1 +2)^2 -2 /1 = (9 -2)/1 =7.\n\nCheck d1=1 <7 and d0=2 <7: yes.\n\nSo, base 7 gets a count +=1.\n\nCase 2: d1=2.\n\nCompute b:\n\nb = (2 +2)^2 -2 /2 = (16 -2)/2=14/2=7.\n\nCheck d1=2 <7? 2<7 yes. d0=2 <7 yes.\n\nSo, base 7 gets another count +=1.\n\nSo, for d0=2, base 7 has two pairs contributing: (1,2) and (2,2).\n\nThus, base 7 count is now 2.\n\nNext, d0=3.\n\nm=3^2 -3=9-3=6.\n\nDivisors of 6: 1,2,3,6.\n\nd1 can be 1,2,3,6.\n\nFor each d1:\n\nCase 1: d1=1.\n\nb=(1+3)^2 -3 /1 = (16 -3)/1=13.\n\nCheck 1<13 and 3<13: yes. So, base 13 count +=1.\n\nCase 2: d1=2.\n\nb=(2+3)^2 -3 /2 = (25 -3)/2=22/2=11.\n\nCheck 2<11 and 3<11: yes. Base 11 count +=1.\n\nCase3: d1=3.\n\nb=(3+3)^2 -3 /3= (36 -3)/3=33/3=11.\n\nCheck 3<11 and 3<11: yes.

Base 13 count +=1.\n\nSo, for d0=3, bases 13 and 11 each get two counts.\n\nThus, base 11 count is now 2, base 13 count is now 3.\n\nProceeding similarly for d0=4.\n\nd0=4:\n\nm=4^2 -4=16-4=12.\n\nDivisors of 12:1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\nd1 can be 1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\nFor each d1:\n\nCase1: d1=1.\n\nb=(1+4)^2 -4 /1=25-4=21.\n\nCheck 1<21 and 4<21: yes. Base21 +=1.\n\nCase2: d1=2.\n\nb=(2+4)^2 -4 /2=36-4=32/2=16.\n\nCheck 2<16 and 4<16: yes. Base16 +=1.\n\nCase3: d1=3.\n\nb=(3+4)^2 -4 /3=49-4=45/3=15.\n\nCheck 3<15 and4<15: yes.

Base43 +=1.\n\nThus, for d0=6, bases43,29,25,23 each get two counts.\n\nSo, base23 count=2, base25=2, base29=2, base43=2.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tedious, but I can see a pattern.\n\nEach d0 adds counts to multiple bases. The bases accumulate counts from different d0 and d1 pairs.\n\nI need to find for each base how many such pairs contribute to it.\n\nBut since manually computing this for each d0 is time-consuming, perhaps I can find a way to structure this.",

So, if b\u00b2 -2b +1 \u2264 b\u00b2 -1, then subtracting, we get -2b +1 \u2264 -1 \u2192 -2b \u2264 -2 \u2192 2b \u22652 \u2192 b \u22651, which is always true since b \u22652.\n\nSo, for each s from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1, we can have possible s values, and for each s, we can try to see if there are digits d1 and d0 in base b such that d1 + d0 = s and d1*b + d0 = s\u00b2.\n\nSo, let's re-express the equation d1*b + d0 = s\u00b2. Since d1 + d0 = s, we can write d0 = s - d1. Substituting into the first equation:\n\nd1*b + (s - d1) = s\u00b2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nd1*b + s - d1 = s\u00b2 \u2192 d1*(b - 1) + s = s\u00b2 \u2192 d1*(b -1) = s\u00b2 - s.\n\nSo, d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1).\n\nSince d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, the numerator (s\u00b2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). So, (b -1) must divide (s\u00b2 - s).\n\nMoreover, d1 must satisfy 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b-1. So, let's write:\n\nd1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1).\n\nSo, for a given b, we can iterate through possible s values (from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1), compute d1, and check if it's an integer in the correct range. For each valid s, we can then compute d0 = s - d1 and check if d0 is a valid digit (i.e., 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b-1).\n\nBut we need to find, for each b, how many such pairs (d1, d0) exist, i.e., how many s satisfy these conditions.\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest b \u22652 such that the number of b-eautiful integers n is more than ten.\n\nSo, for each b, we need to count the number of s where:\n\n- s is integer, s \u2265 ceil(sqrt(b)), s \u2264 b-1.\n\n- (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b-1).\n\n- d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b-1) is integer, 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b-1.\n\n- d0 = s - d1 is between 0 and b-1.\n\nEach such s gives a unique n = s\u00b2, so each valid s corresponds to one b-eautiful integer n.\n\nHence, the number of b-eautiful integers is equal to the number of valid s values for that base b.\n\nSo, to find the minimal b where the count is >10.\n\nSo, the approach to solve this is:\n\n1.

Check if 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b-1.\n\n      iv. If all conditions met, count this s as a valid case.\n\n   c.

So, let's write:\n\nd1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1).\n\nSo, for a given b, we can iterate through possible s values (from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1), compute d1, and check if it's an integer in the correct range. For each valid s, we can then compute d0 = s - d1 and check if d0 is a valid digit (i.e., 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b-1).\n\nBut we need to find, for each b, how many such pairs (d1, d0) exist, i.e., how many s satisfy these conditions.\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest b \u22652 such that the number of b-eautiful integers n is more than ten.\n\nSo, for each b, we need to count the number of s where:\n\n- s is integer, s \u2265 ceil(sqrt(b)), s \u2264 b-1.\n\n- (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b-1).\n\n- d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b-1) is integer, 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b-1.\n\n- d0 = s - d1 is between 0 and b-1.\n\nEach such s gives a unique n = s\u00b2, so each valid s corresponds to one b-eautiful integer n.\n\nHence, the number of b-eautiful integers is equal to the number of valid s values for that base b.\n\nSo, to find the minimal b where the count is >10.\n\nSo, the approach to solve this is:\n\n1. For each b starting from 2 upwards:\n\n   a. Compute the possible s range: s_min = ceil(sqrt(b)), s_max = b-1.\n\n   b. For each s in s_min to s_max:\n\n      i. Check if (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b -1). If not, skip.\n\n      ii. Compute d1 = (s\u00b2 -s)/(b-1). Check if d1 is integer and 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b-1.\n\n      iii. Compute d0 = s - d1. Check if 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b-1.\n\n      iv. If all conditions met, count this s as a valid case.\n\n   c. After checking all s, if the count >10, return this b as the answer.\n\nBut this seems computationally intensive, especially since b can be large. So perhaps there's a smarter way.",

So, if b\u00b2 -2b +1 \u2264 b\u00b2 -1, then subtracting, we get -2b +1 \u2264 -1 \u2192 -2b \u2264 -2 \u2192 2b \u22652 \u2192 b \u22651, which is always true since b \u22652.\n\nSo, for each s from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1, we can have possible s values, and for each s, we can try to see if there are digits d1 and d0 in base b such that d1 + d0 = s and d1*b + d0 = s\u00b2.\n\nSo, let's re-express the equation d1*b + d0 = s\u00b2. Since d1 + d0 = s, we can write d0 = s - d1. Substituting into the first equation:\n\nd1*b + (s - d1) = s\u00b2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nd1*b + s - d1 = s\u00b2 \u2192 d1*(b - 1) + s = s\u00b2 \u2192 d1*(b -1) = s\u00b2 - s.\n\nSo, d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1).\n\nSince d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, the numerator (s\u00b2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). So, (b -1) must divide (s\u00b2 - s).\n\nMoreover, d1 must satisfy 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b-1. So, let's write:\n\nd1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1).\n\nSo, for a given b, we can iterate through possible s values (from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1), compute d1, and check if it's an integer in the correct range. For each valid s, we can then compute d0 = s - d1 and check if d0 is a valid digit (i.e., 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b-1).\n\nBut we need to find, for each b, how many such pairs (d1, d0) exist, i.e., how many s satisfy these conditions.\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest b \u22652 such that the number of b-eautiful integers n is more than ten.\n\nSo, for each b, we need to count the number of s where:\n\n- s is integer, s \u2265 ceil(sqrt(b)), s \u2264 b-1.\n\n- (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b-1).\n\n- d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b-1) is integer, 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b-1.\n\n- d0 = s - d1 is between 0 and b-1.\n\nEach such s gives a unique n = s\u00b2, so each valid s corresponds to one b-eautiful integer n.\n\nHence, the number of b-eautiful integers is equal to the number of valid s values for that base b.\n\nSo, to find the minimal b where the count is >10.\n\nSo, the approach to solve this is:\n\n1. For each b starting from 2 upwards:\n\n   a. Compute the possible s range: s_min = ceil(sqrt(b)), s_max = b-1.\n\n   b. For each s in s_min to s_max:\n\n      i. Check if (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b -1). If not, skip.\n\n      ii. Compute d1 = (s\u00b2 -s)/(b-1). Check if d1 is integer and 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b-1.\n\n      iii. Compute d0 = s - d1. Check if 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b-1.\n\n      iv. If all conditions met, count this s as a valid case.\n\n   c. After checking all s, if the count >10, return this b as the answer.\n\nBut this seems computationally intensive, especially since b can be large. So perhaps there's a smarter way.",
