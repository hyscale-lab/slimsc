Since the median is an integer not present in the list, that means that the two middle numbers must sum to an even number, but neither of them is equal to the median.

Because only then the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which might not be present in the list.\n\nLet me think about that again. If the list has an even number of elements, say 2n, then the median is the average of the nth and (n+1)th elements. If that average is an integer and not present in the list, that's possible. But if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element, which is definitely in the list.

Let's denote the number of elements as n, which is even.\n\nSecond, the mode is 9, and it's unique.

Because for even n, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. So if those two middle numbers are different, their average might not be in the list.\n\nSo, for example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, their average is 9, which is an integer. But 9 isn't present in the list. So that could be a scenario. Or if the two middle numbers are 7 and 11, the average is 9, but again, 9 isn't in the list.\n\nSo, given that, the median must be an integer, but the median itself isn't in the list, which implies that the list has an even number of elements, and the two middle numbers average to the median, which is an integer not present in the list.\n\nSo, to summarize, the list has an even number of elements, and the two middle numbers add up to 2 times the median, which is an integer not in the list.\n\nSo, let's try to structure the list.\n\nFirst, since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number. So let's think about how many times 9 appears.\n\nIf the list has n elements, where n is even, say n=2k. So the two middle numbers are the k-th and (k+1)-th elements.

Let's say the median is m, which is an integer, and m is not in the list.\n\nSo, m is an integer, and m is the median, which is the average of the two middle numbers. So if the two middle numbers are a and b, then (a + b)/2 = m, so a + b = 2m.\n\nSince m is not in the list, neither a nor b can be m, or both are not m.",

So, that element would be part of the list. But the problem says the median is a positive integer not in the list. Therefore, the list must have an even number of elements. Because for even n, the median is the average of the (n/2)th and (n/2 +1)th elements. If their average is an integer not present in the list, that's possible.\n\nSo, n must be even. Let me note that.\n\nSo, n is even. Let's denote n = 2m, where m is a positive integer. Then, the median is (a_m + a_{m+1}) / 2, which must be an integer, so a_m + a_{m+1} must be even, meaning a_m and a_{m+1} are both even or both odd.\n\nMoreover, since the median is not in the list, it must not be equal to either a_m or a_{m+1}. So, the median is an integer, but it's not present in the list.\n\nAlright, so n is even, let's say n=2m. So, the sum is 30, so the average is 30/n, which is 15/n. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps yet.\n\nLet me think about the mode. Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number. Let's say 9 appears k times. Then every other number can appear at most k-1 times.\n\nAlso, since all numbers are positive integers, the smallest possible number is 1.\n\nNow, let's try to construct such a list. Let's think about possible n.\n\nLet me start by considering possible values of n. Since the sum is 30, and all numbers are positive integers, the maximum possible n is 30 (if all numbers are 1). But we have a mode, so n must be less than 30.\n\nBut with the mode being 9, which is a relatively large number, the list can't have too many elements.

Because for even n, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. So if those two middle numbers are different, their average might not be in the list.\n\nSo, for example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, their average is 9, which is an integer. But 9 isn't present in the list. So that could be a scenario. Or if the two middle numbers are 7 and 11, the average is 9, but again, 9 isn't in the list.\n\nSo, given that, the median must be an integer, but the median itself isn't in the list, which implies that the list has an even number of elements, and the two middle numbers average to the median, which is an integer not present in the list.\n\nSo, to summarize, the list has an even number of elements, and the two middle numbers add up to 2 times the median, which is an integer not in the list.\n\nSo, let's try to structure the list.\n\nFirst, since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number.

Because for even n, the median is the average of the (n/2)th and (n/2 +1)th elements. If their average is an integer not present in the list, that's possible.\n\nSo, n must be even. Let me note that.\n\nSo, n is even. Let's denote n = 2m, where m is a positive integer. Then, the median is (a_m + a_{m+1}) / 2, which must be an integer, so a_m + a_{m+1} must be even, meaning a_m and a_{m+1} are both even or both odd.\n\nMoreover, since the median is not in the list, it must not be equal to either a_m or a_{m+1}. So, the median is an integer, but it's not present in the list.\n\nAlright, so n is even, let's say n=2m. So, the sum is 30, so the average is 30/n, which is 15/n.

Because for even n, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. So if those two middle numbers are different, their average might not be in the list.\n\nSo, for example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, their average is 9, which is an integer. But 9 isn't present in the list. So that could be a scenario. Or if the two middle numbers are 7 and 11, the average is 9, but again, 9 isn't in the list.\n\nSo, given that, the median must be an integer, but the median itself isn't in the list, which implies that the list has an even number of elements, and the two middle numbers average to the median, which is an integer not present in the list.\n\nSo, to summarize, the list has an even number of elements, and the two middle numbers add up to 2 times the median, which is an integer not in the list.\n\nSo, let's try to structure the list.\n\nFirst, since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number.

Because for even n, the median is the average of the (n/2)th and (n/2 +1)th elements. If their average is an integer not present in the list, that's possible.\n\nSo, n must be even. Let me note that.\n\nSo, n is even. Let's denote n = 2m, where m is a positive integer. Then, the median is (a_m + a_{m+1}) / 2, which must be an integer, so a_m + a_{m+1} must be even, meaning a_m and a_{m+1} are both even or both odd.\n\nMoreover, since the median is not in the list, it must not be equal to either a_m or a_{m+1}. So, the median is an integer, but it's not present in the list.\n\nAlright, so n is even, let's say n=2m. So, the sum is 30, so the average is 30/n, which is 15/n.

Because for even n, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. So if those two middle numbers are different, their average might not be in the list.\n\nSo, for example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, their average is 9, which is an integer. But 9 isn't present in the list. So that could be a scenario.

Let me note that.\n\nSo, n is even. Let's denote n = 2m, where m is a positive integer. Then, the median is (a_m + a_{m+1}) / 2, which must be an integer, so a_m + a_{m+1} must be even, meaning a_m and a_{m+1} are both even or both odd.\n\nMoreover, since the median is not in the list, it must not be equal to either a_m or a_{m+1}.

If we have three 9s, others can appear up to two times.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nLet me consider that the list has even length because the median is an average of two numbers. So, n is even, say n=2k.\n\nSo, the two middle numbers are the k-th and (k+1)-th elements. Their average is m, which is the median, not in the list.\n\nSo, let's try to structure the list.\n\nLet me think of n=8, for example. Then the two middle numbers are the 4th and 5th elements. Their average is m, not in the list.\n\nSo, let's try to make a list where the 4th and 5th numbers are 8 and 10, making the median 9.",

Because for even n, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. So if those two middle numbers are different, their average might not be in the list.\n\nSo, for example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, their average is 9, which is an integer. But 9 isn't present in the list. So that could be a scenario.
