So, the entire product is the product over k=0 to12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nWhich can be written as product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) times product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nEach of these products is of the form product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = 1 - a^13, as we saw earlier.

So, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4} and e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSince 13 * \u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, because 13 divided by 4 is 3 with remainder 1, so 3*2\u03c0 = 6\u03c0 is more than 13\u03c0/4, but wait, wait, 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, because 3\u03c0 is 12\u03c0/4, so adding \u03c0/4 gives 13\u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is more than \u03c0, so we can subtract multiples of 2\u03c0 to get the angle within 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\nCompute 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.

The angle (argument) is \u03c0/4 radians because it's on the line y = x in the first quadrant.\n\nSo, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.

So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the exponents:\n\ne^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i*(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * e^{i3\u03c0} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * (-1), because e^{i\u03c0} = -1, so e^{i3\u03c0} = (e^{i\u03c0})^3 = (-1)^3 = -1.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i*(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{-i\u03c0/4} * e^{-i3\u03c0} = e^{-i\u03c0/4} * (-1).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-1) * e^{i\u03c0/4} = -64 sqrt(2) * (cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4)) = -64 sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = -64 sqrt(2) * ( (1 + i)/sqrt(2) ) = -64 (1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-1) * e^{-i\u03c0/4} = -64 sqrt(2) * (cos(-\u03c0/4) + i sin(-\u03c0/4)) = -64 sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = -64 sqrt(2) * ( (1 - i)/sqrt(2) ) = -64 (1 - i).\n\nSo, now, (1 + i)^13 = -64 (1 + i), and (1 - i)^13 = -64 (1 - i).\n\nSo, substituting back into the expression:\n\n[ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / i ] = [ (-64 (1 + i) - 1 ) / i ] = [ -64(1 + i) - 1 ] / i.\n\nSimilarly, [ ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / (-i) ] = [ (-64 (1 - i) - 1 ) / (-i) ] = [ -64(1 - i) - 1 ] / (-i).\n\nLet me compute each numerator separately:\n\nFirst numerator: -64(1 + i) -1 = -64 -64i - 1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSecond numerator: -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, the first fraction is (-65 -64i)/i, and the second is (-65 +64i)/(-i).\n\nLet me simplify each of these complex fractions.\n\nStarting with (-65 -64i)/i. To simplify, multiply numerator and denominator by -i (since 1/i = -i):\n\n(-65 -64i)/i * (-i/-i) = [ (-65 -64i)(-i) ] / (i * -i) = [ 65i +64i^2 ] / (1) because i*(-i) = -i^2 = 1.\n\nSince i^2 = -1, 64i^2 = -64. So, numerator becomes 65i -64.\n\nSo, (-65 -64i)/i = 65i -64 = (-64 +65i).\n\nSimilarly, compute (-65 +64i)/(-i). Multiply numerator and denominator by i:\n\n[ (-65 +64i) * i ] / ( (-i)*i ) = [ -65i +64i^2 ] / (1) since (-i)*i = -i^2 = 1.\n\nAgain, i^2 = -1, so 64i^2 = -64. So, numerator becomes -65i -64.\n\nSo, (-65 +64i)/(-i) = -65i -64 = (-64 -65i).\n\nNow, the entire product is [ (-64 +65i) ] * [ (-64 -65i) ].\n\nThis looks like the product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is the square of the modulus.\n\nSo, | (-64 +65i) |^2 = (-64)^2 + (65)^2 = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.",

Let me verify that.\n\nYes, since \u03c9^k for k=0 to 12 are the 13th roots of unity, so their product is x^{13} - 1 = product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k). So, product_{k=1}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = (x^{13} - 1)/(x - 1).\n\nSo, in our case, for x = (1 + i), the product from k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) is equal to ((1 + i)^{13} - 1)/( (1 + i) - 1 ). Similarly, for x = (1 - i), it's ((1 - i)^{13} - 1)/( (1 - i) - 1 ).\n\nTherefore, the entire product is [ ((1 + i)^{13} - 1)/( (1 + i - 1) ) ] multiplied by [ ((1 - i)^{13} - 1)/( (1 - i - 1) ) ].\n\nSimplify the denominators:\n\n(1 + i - 1) = i, and (1 - i - 1) = -i.

Similarly, 1/(-i) = i.\n\nSo, each term can be rewritten:\n\nFirst term: [ ((1 + i)^{13} - 1) * (-i) ]\n\nSecond term: [ ((1 - i)^{13} - 1) * i ]\n\nSo the entire product is [ ((1 + i)^{13} - 1) * (-i) ] * [ ((1 - i)^{13} - 1) * i ].\n\nMultiply the constants: (-i) * i = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So, the constants multiply to 1. Thus, the product simplifies to [ ((1 + i)^{13} - 1) * ((1 - i)^{13} - 1) ].\n\nSo now, I need to compute ((1 + i)^{13} - 1) * ((1 - i)^{13} - 1).\n\nHmm, that's still a bit complex. Let me compute (1 + i)^{13} and (1 - i)^{13} separately.\n\nFirst, note that (1 + i) is a complex number. Its magnitude is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and its angle (argument) is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle -\u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, when we raise (1 + i) to the 13th power, using De Moivre's theorem, it becomes (sqrt(2))^13 * (cos(13\u03c0/4) + i sin(13\u03c0/4)).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 is (sqrt(2))^13 * (cos(-13\u03c0/4) + i sin(-13\u03c0/4)).\n\nBut cos is even and sin is odd, so cos(-13\u03c0/4) = cos(13\u03c0/4), and sin(-13\u03c0/4) = -sin(13\u03c0/4).\n\nSo, let's compute (sqrt(2))^13 first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ cos(13\u03c0/4) + i sin(13\u03c0/4) ]\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ cos(13\u03c0/4) - i sin(13\u03c0/4) ]\n\nNow, let's compute cos(13\u03c0/4) and sin(13\u03c0/4).\n\n13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, since 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4.",

Now, I just need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, then plug them into this expression.\n\nFirst, let's compute (1 + i)^13. I know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is \u221a(1^2 + 1^2) = \u221a2. The argument is arctangent(1/1) = \u03c0/4. So, 1 + i = \u221a2 e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (\u221a2)^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) is the conjugate of (1 + i), so its modulus is also \u221a2, and its argument is -\u03c0/4. So, (1 - i)^13 = (\u221a2)^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (\u221a2)^13.

Let me compute 13 * \u03c0/4 modulo 2\u03c0, since angles are periodic with 2\u03c0.\n\n13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0.

          "text1": "Wait, but in our case, each factor is (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) multiplied by (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)). So, for each k, we have two factors. So, the entire product is the product over k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nThat is, the product can be written as [product over k=0 to12 (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] multiplied by [product over k=0 to12 (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\nEach of these products is equal to - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) and similarly for (1 - i). Let me write that down.\n\nSo, let me denote a = 1 + i and b = 1 - i.\n\nThen, product over k=0 to12 (\u03c9^k - a) = - (a^13 - 1)/(a - 1). Similarly, product over k=0 to12 (\u03c9^k - b) = - (b^13 -1)/(b -1).\n\nTherefore, the total product is [ - (a^13 -1)/(a -1) ] * [ - (b^13 -1)/(b -1) ] = [ (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1) ] / [ (a -1)(b -1) ].\n\nSo, the product becomes ( (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1) ) divided by ( (a -1)(b -1) ).\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute a = 1 + i and b = 1 - i.\n\nCompute a -1 = i and b -1 = -i. So, (a -1)(b -1) = (i)(-i) = -i\u00b2 = -(-1) = 1.\n\nSo, the denominator is 1. That's convenient.\n\nSo, the product simplifies to (a^13 - 1)(b^13 -1).\n\nNow, let's compute (a^13 -1) and (b^13 -1).\n\nBut a = 1 + i. Let's compute a^13.\n\nFirst, let's compute a in polar form. 1 + i has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4. So, a = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, a^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly for b = 1 - i, which is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}. So, b^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, compute the exponents e^{i *13\u03c0/4} and e^{-i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\n13\u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Since 13/4 = 3 + 1/4, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But angles are periodic modulo 2\u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0*(1) = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{i *5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i *5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, a^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) ) ].\n\nCompute that: 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (- (2)/2 ) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the other term is 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) ) = same as above, so a^13 = -64(1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, compute b^13: 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i) ) ].\n\nSame computation: 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -64, so b^13 = -64(1 - i).\n\nTherefore, a^13 -1 = -64(1 + i) -1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, b^13 -1 = -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, the product (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1) = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i). That looks like the product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's | -65 -64i |\u00b2.\n\nWhich is (-65)^2 + (64)^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n(-65)^2 = 4225\n\n64^2 = 4096\n\nSo total is 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nTherefore, the product is 8321.",

So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the exponents:\n\ne^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i*(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * e^{i3\u03c0} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * (-1), because e^{i\u03c0} = -1, so e^{i3\u03c0} = (e^{i\u03c0})^3 = (-1)^3 = -1.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i*(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{-i\u03c0/4} * e^{-i3\u03c0} = e^{-i\u03c0/4} * (-1).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-1) * e^{i\u03c0/4} = -64 sqrt(2) * (cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4)) = -64 sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = -64 sqrt(2) * ( (1 + i)/sqrt(2) ) = -64 (1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-1) * e^{-i\u03c0/4} = -64 sqrt(2) * (cos(-\u03c0/4) + i sin(-\u03c0/4)) = -64 sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = -64 sqrt(2) * ( (1 - i)/sqrt(2) ) = -64 (1 - i).\n\nSo, now, (1 + i)^13 = -64 (1 + i), and (1 - i)^13 = -64 (1 - i).\n\nSo, substituting back into the expression:\n\n[ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / i ] = [ (-64 (1 + i) - 1 ) / i ] = [ -64(1 + i) - 1 ] / i.\n\nSimilarly, [ ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / (-i) ] = [ (-64 (1 - i) - 1 ) / (-i) ] = [ -64(1 - i) - 1 ] / (-i).\n\nLet me compute each numerator separately:\n\nFirst numerator: -64(1 + i) -1 = -64 -64i - 1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSecond numerator: -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, the first fraction is (-65 -64i)/i, and the second is (-65 +64i)/(-i).\n\nLet me simplify each of these complex fractions.\n\nStarting with (-65 -64i)/i. To simplify, multiply numerator and denominator by -i (since 1/i = -i):\n\n(-65 -64i)/i * (-i/-i) = [ (-65 -64i)(-i) ] / (i * -i) = [ 65i +64i^2 ] / (1) because i*(-i) = -i^2 = 1.\n\nSince i^2 = -1, 64i^2 = -64. So, numerator becomes 65i -64.\n\nSo, (-65 -64i)/i = 65i -64 = (-64 +65i).\n\nSimilarly, compute (-65 +64i)/(-i). Multiply numerator and denominator by i:\n\n[ (-65 +64i) * i ] / ( (-i)*i ) = [ -65i +64i^2 ] / (1) since (-i)*i = -i^2 = 1.\n\nAgain, i^2 = -1, so 64i^2 = -64. So, numerator becomes -65i -64.\n\nSo, (-65 +64i)/(-i) = -65i -64 = (-64 -65i).\n\nNow, the entire product is [ (-64 +65i) ] * [ (-64 -65i) ].\n\nThis looks like the product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is the square of the modulus.\n\nSo, | (-64 +65i) |^2 = (-64)^2 + (65)^2 = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.",

So, (1 + i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{i n \u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i 13 \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle -\u03c0/4, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i 13 \u03c0/4}.\n\nBut let me compute e^{i 13 \u03c0/4} first. 13 \u03c0/4 is more than 2\u03c0, so let's subtract 2\u03c0 (which is 8\u03c0/4) to find the equivalent angle.\n\n13\u03c0/4 - 3*(2\u03c0) = 13\u03c0/4 - 6\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 24\u03c0/4 = -11\u03c0/4.",

So, in this case, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is the product from k=1 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k). Therefore, the product over x of (x - a) is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a).\n\nSo, going back, the product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product over x of (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). Which is equal to \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i). Because for each x, it's (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)), so the product over all x is [product (x - (1 + i))] * [product (x - (1 - i))], which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).\n\nSo now, I need to compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i). Let me recall that \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. So, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(x - 1).\n\nThus, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) = (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(a - 1). Therefore, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = [(1 + i)^13 - 1]/[(1 + i) - 1] = [(1 + i)^13 - 1]/(i). Similarly, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = [(1 - i)^13 - 1]/[(1 - i) - 1] = [(1 - i)^13 - 1]/(-i).\n\nSo, let me compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) separately.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13. Let's compute powers of (1 + i). I know that (1 + i) has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4, so when raised to the 13th power, the magnitude becomes (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2). The angle becomes 13 * \u03c0/4 = (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0. But since angles are modulo 2\u03c0, 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 is \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0 = \u03c0/4 + \u03c0 = 5\u03c0/4. So, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)) = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) = 64*(-1)(1 + i) = -64(1 + i).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i). Then, (1 + i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 + i) - 1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nThen, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = ( -65 -64i ) / (i) = (-65 -64i)/i. Let me multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make it easier: (-65 -64i)(-i) / (i*(-i)) = (65i + 64i\u00b2) / 1 = 65i + 64*(-1) = 65i -64.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = -64 + 65i.\n\nSimilarly, compute (1 - i)^13. Since (1 - i) is the conjugate of (1 + i), so its magnitude is also sqrt(2), but angle is -\u03c0/4. Raising to 13th power, magnitude is 2^(13/2) same as before, 64*sqrt(2). The angle becomes 13*(-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4. Adding multiples of 2\u03c0 to bring it within [0, 2\u03c0): Let's see, -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0 + 16\u03c0)/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So, the angle is 3\u03c0/4. So, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) [ cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) ] = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i) = 64*(-1)(1 - i) = -64(1 - i).\n\nTherefore, (1 - i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nThen, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = ( -65 +64i ) / ( -i ) = ( -65 +64i ) / (-i). Multiply numerator and denominator by i: (-65 +64i)i / (-i^2) = (-65i +64i\u00b2)/1 = (-65i -64)/1 = -64 -65i.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = -64 -65i.\n\nNow, the product \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) is equal to (-64 +65i)(-64 -65i). Let me compute that. It's a product of complex conjugates, so it's equal to (-64)^2 + (65)^2. Compute that:\n\n64\u00b2 = 4096, 65\u00b2=4225. So, 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. Therefore, the original product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is equal to 8321.",

So, \u03a6_p(x) = (x^p - 1)/(x - 1) = x^{p-1} + x^{p-2} + ... + x + 1.\n\nSo, correct, \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + 1.\n\nTherefore, product_{k=1}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + 1.\n\nSo, in our case, if we set x = (1 + i), then product_{k=1}^{12} ( (1 + i) - \u03c9^k ) = \u03a6_13(1 + i), and similarly for (1 - i), product is \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\nThus, P = \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\nSo, I need to compute \u03a6_13(1 + i) and \u03a6_13(1 - i), then multiply them, and that will give me the product P.\n\nHmm, okay, so let me remember that \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.

The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(2), and its argument is \u03c0/4.

Let's compute 13 * \u03c0/4 modulo 2\u03c0.\n\n13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0. So, angle is \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nCompute this: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = same as above, so also -64i.",

That seems correct because x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 factors into (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\n2.

Calculated (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 correctly? Let me check:\n\n(1 + i) in polar form: magnitude sqrt(2), angle \u03c0/4. Raising to 13th power: (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 sqrt(2). Angle: 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is \u03c0/4 more than 3\u03c0, but 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0. So, 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0, so modulo 2\u03c0, it's \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, the angle is 5\u03c0/4. Therefore, (1 + i)^13 is 64 sqrt(2) [cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)].\n\ncos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, multiply by 64 sqrt(2):\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = -64\n\nSimilarly, 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 i) = -64i. So, together, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for (1 - i)^13:\n\nAngle is -13\u03c0/4.

As I noted earlier, since product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1, so product_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k) = c\u00b9\u00b3 - 1.

Perhaps using De Moivre's theorem.\n\n1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4 radians.

So, 13\u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, cos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nTherefore, A = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 i) = 64 * (-2)/2 i = -64i.\n\nSo, A = (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, B = (1 - i)^13.\n\nAgain, modulus is sqrt(2)^13 = 2^{13/2} = same as A, which is 64*sqrt(2).\n\nThe angle is 13*(-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4.

That's 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2)/2 = 64 * (- (\u221a2 * \u221a2))/2 = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part is 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2) i, which is also -64i.\n\nSo (1 + i)^13 = (-64 - 64i). Then subtract 1: (-64 - 64i) - 1 = (-65 - 64i).\n\nSimilarly, let's compute (1 - i)^13. Since 1 - i is the conjugate of 1 + i, so its magnitude is the same, sqrt(2), and angle is -\u03c0/4.\n\nSo (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 \u00d7 e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nAgain, (sqrt(2))^13 is 64\u221a2.\n\nThe angle: -13\u03c0/4. Let's add multiples of 2\u03c0 to get it within 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\n-13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0 + 16\u03c0)/4 = 3\u03c0/4.",

Correct.\n\n13\u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is the same as \u03c0/4 but in the third quadrant because 13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is equivalent to 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4, which is in the third quadrant. So, cos(5\u03c0/4) is -\u221a2/2, and sin is -\u221a2/2. So, e^{i5\u03c0/4} = (-\u221a2/2) - i\u221a2/2. So, when multiplied by 64\u221a2, that gives 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2). Let's compute 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2) = 64 * ( (-\u221a2 * \u221a2)/2 ) = 64*(-2/2) = 64*(-1) = -64. Similarly, for the imaginary part: 64\u221a2 * (-i\u221a2/2) = 64*(-i*(2)/2) = 64*(-i) = -64i. So, overall, (1 + i)^13 = (-64 -64i). Subtract 1, gives (-65 -64i). Correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) is \u221a2 e^{-i\u03c0/4}, so (1 - i)^13 is (\u221a2)^13 e^{-i13\u03c0/4} = 64\u221a2 e^{-i5\u03c0/4}. e^{-i5\u03c0/4} is cos(-5\u03c0/4) + i sin(-5\u03c0/4) = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2) + i\u221a2/2. So, 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2) = 64*(-1) + 64i = (-64 + 64i). Subtract 1 gives (-65 +64i).

Angle: 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is \u03c0/4 more than 3\u03c0, but 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0. So, 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0, so modulo 2\u03c0, it's \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, the angle is 5\u03c0/4.

Since a^2 = 2a -2, we can compute higher powers.\n\nFrom earlier calculations, I found that a^4 = -4.\n\nLet me compute a^13:\n\na^4 = -4\n\na^5 = a^4 * a = -4a\n\na^6 = a^5 * a = -4a^2 = -4*(2a - 2) = -8a +8\n\na^7 = a^6 * a = (-8a +8)*a = -8a^2 +8a = -8*(2a -2) +8a = (-16a +16) +8a = (-8a +16)\n\na^8 = a^7 * a = (-8a +16)*a = -8a^2 +16a = -8*(2a -2) +16a = (-16a +16) +16a = 16\n\na^9 = a^8 * a = 16a\n\na^10 = a^9 * a = 16a^2 =16*(2a -2) =32a -32\n\na^11 = a^10 * a = (32a -32)*a =32a^2 -32a =32*(2a -2) -32a =64a -64 -32a =32a -64\n\na^12 = a^11 * a = (32a -64)*a =32a^2 -64a =32*(2a -2) -64a =64a -64 -64a =-64\n\na^13 = a^12 * a = (-64)*a =-64a\n\nSo, a^13 = -64a.\n\nThen, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) = (a^13 - 1)/(a - 1) = (-64a -1)/(a -1).",
          "text2": "Wait, no. Actually, for prime n, \u03a6_n(x) is the product over k=1 to n-1 of (x - \u03c9^k), where \u03c9 is a primitive nth root. So, in this case, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is the product from k=1 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k). Therefore, the product over x of (x - a) is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a).\n\nSo, going back, the product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product over x of (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). Which is equal to \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i). Because for each x, it's (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)), so the product over all x is [product (x - (1 + i))] * [product (x - (1 - i))], which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).\n\nSo now, I need to compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i). Let me recall that \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. So, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(x - 1).\n\nThus, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) = (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(a - 1). Therefore, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = [(1 + i)^13 - 1]/[(1 + i) - 1] = [(1 + i)^13 - 1]/(i). Similarly, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = [(1 - i)^13 - 1]/[(1 - i) - 1] = [(1 - i)^13 - 1]/(-i).\n\nSo, let me compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) separately.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13. Let's compute powers of (1 + i). I know that (1 + i) has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4, so when raised to the 13th power, the magnitude becomes (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2). The angle becomes 13 * \u03c0/4 = (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0. But since angles are modulo 2\u03c0, 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 is \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0 = \u03c0/4 + \u03c0 = 5\u03c0/4. So, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)) = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) = 64*(-1)(1 + i) = -64(1 + i).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i). Then, (1 + i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 + i) - 1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nThen, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = ( -65 -64i ) / (i) = (-65 -64i)/i. Let me multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make it easier: (-65 -64i)(-i) / (i*(-i)) = (65i + 64i\u00b2) / 1 = 65i + 64*(-1) = 65i -64.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = -64 + 65i.\n\nSimilarly, compute (1 - i)^13. Since (1 - i) is the conjugate of (1 + i), so its magnitude is also sqrt(2), but angle is -\u03c0/4. Raising to 13th power, magnitude is 2^(13/2) same as before, 64*sqrt(2). The angle becomes 13*(-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4. Adding multiples of 2\u03c0 to bring it within [0, 2\u03c0): Let's see, -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0 + 16\u03c0)/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So, the angle is 3\u03c0/4. So, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) [ cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) ] = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i) = 64*(-1)(1 - i) = -64(1 - i).\n\nTherefore, (1 - i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nThen, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = ( -65 +64i ) / ( -i ) = ( -65 +64i ) / (-i). Multiply numerator and denominator by i: (-65 +64i)i / (-i^2) = (-65i +64i\u00b2)/1 = (-65i -64)/1 = -64 -65i.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = -64 -65i.\n\nNow, the product \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) is equal to (-64 +65i)(-64 -65i). Let me compute that. It's a product of complex conjugates, so it's equal to (-64)^2 + (65)^2. Compute that:\n\n64\u00b2 = 4096, 65\u00b2=4225. So, 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. Therefore, the original product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is equal to 8321.",

Since angles are periodic with 2\u03c0, -5\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 3\u03c0/4 (since -5\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = 3\u03c0/4).\n\nSo, a^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{i5\u03c0/4} = 64*sqrt(2) * [cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)] = 64*sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2) = 64*sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2)(1 + i) = 64*(-1)(1 + i) = -64(1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, b^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{-i5\u03c0/4} = 64*sqrt(2) * [cos(-5\u03c0/4) + i sin(-5\u03c0/4)] = 64*sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2) = 64*sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2)(1 - i) = 64*(-1)(1 - i) = -64(1 - i).\n\nSo, a^13 = -64(1 + i), and b^13 = -64(1 - i).\n\nNow, compute (a^13 - 1)/(a - 1) and (b^13 - 1)/(b - 1).\n\nFirst, let's compute (a^13 - 1) = (-64(1 + i) - 1) = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (b^13 - 1) = (-64(1 - i) - 1) = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nNow, compute (a^13 - 1)/(a - 1) = (-65 -64i)/( (1 + i) - 1 ) = (-65 -64i)/(i).\n\nBecause a - 1 = (1 + i) - 1 = i.\n\nSo, (-65 -64i)/i = multiply numerator and denominator by -i: [(-65 -64i)(-i)] / (i*(-i)) = [65i +64i\u00b2] / 1 = 65i +64(-1) = 65i -64.\n\nSimilarly, (b^13 - 1)/(b - 1) = (-65 +64i)/( (1 - i) - 1 ) = (-65 +64i)/(-i).\n\nSo, (-65 +64i)/(-i) = multiply numerator and denominator by i: [(-65 +64i)*i]/( -i * i ) = [ -65i +64i\u00b2 ] / 1 = (-65i -64), since i\u00b2 = -1.",

Since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i*(13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0*1)} = e^{i*(13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4)} = e^{i*(5\u03c0/4)}.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i*13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i*(5\u03c0/4)}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{i*5\u03c0/4} and (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{-i*5\u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, e^{i*5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i(sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i*5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i(sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, let's compute (1 + i)^13:\n\n64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i(sqrt(2)/2) ] = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) * (1 + i).",

To do this, we can express (1 + i) in polar form. Let's compute the modulus and argument.\n\nThe modulus of (1 + i) is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is arctan(1/1) = \u03c0/4 radians.

So, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = - (a^{13} - 1).\n\nSo, applying that to our case, the first product is product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = - [ (1 + i)^{13} - 1 ].\n\nSimilarly, the second product is product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = - [ (1 - i)^{13} - 1 ].\n\nTherefore, the entire product is [ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] multiplied by [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nSimplify the signs: (-1) * (-1) = 1, so the product becomes [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nHmm, okay. So now I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, then plug them into this expression.\n\nFirst, let's compute (1 + i)^13. I know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is arctan(1/1) = \u03c0/4. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) has modulus sqrt(2), and argument -\u03c0/4. So, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet's compute (sqrt(2))^{13}. Since sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents. For (1 + i)^13, the angle is 13\u03c0/4. Let's simplify that.\n\n13\u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Because 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 3*\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But angles are periodic modulo 2\u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Similarly, 5\u03c0/4 is in the third quadrant.\n\nSimilarly, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nLet's compute that. Multiplying 64 * sqrt(2) by (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2):\n\nFirst, sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = ( - (2)/2 ) = -1.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2 ) = -i (2)/2 = -i.\n\nSo, multiplying by 64: 64 * (-1 - i) = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nCompute that: sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ) = (-1 + i).\n\nMultiply by 64: 64*(-1 + i) = -64 + 64i.\n\nSo, now we have:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i,\n\n(1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nNow, plug these into our expression:\n\n[ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ] =\n\n[ (-64 - 64i - 1 ) * (-64 + 64i - 1 ) ] =\n\n[ (-65 - 64i ) * (-65 + 64i ) ].\n\nThis is a product of the form (a - b)(a + b) where a = -65 and b = 64i.

So, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4} and e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSince 13 * \u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, because 13 divided by 4 is 3 with remainder 1, so 3*2\u03c0 = 6\u03c0 is more than 13\u03c0/4, but wait, wait, 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, because 3\u03c0 is 12\u03c0/4, so adding \u03c0/4 gives 13\u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is more than \u03c0, so we can subtract multiples of 2\u03c0 to get the angle within 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\nCompute 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.

The angle (argument) is \u03c0/4 radians because it's on the line y = x in the first quadrant.\n\nSo, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.

So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the exponents:\n\ne^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i*(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * e^{i3\u03c0} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * (-1), because e^{i\u03c0} = -1, so e^{i3\u03c0} = (e^{i\u03c0})^3 = (-1)^3 = -1.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i*(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{-i\u03c0/4} * e^{-i3\u03c0} = e^{-i\u03c0/4} * (-1).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-1) * e^{i\u03c0/4} = -64 sqrt(2) * (cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4)) = -64 sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = -64 sqrt(2) * ( (1 + i)/sqrt(2) ) = -64 (1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-1) * e^{-i\u03c0/4} = -64 sqrt(2) * (cos(-\u03c0/4) + i sin(-\u03c0/4)) = -64 sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = -64 sqrt(2) * ( (1 - i)/sqrt(2) ) = -64 (1 - i).\n\nSo, now, (1 + i)^13 = -64 (1 + i), and (1 - i)^13 = -64 (1 - i).\n\nSo, substituting back into the expression:\n\n[ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / i ] = [ (-64 (1 + i) - 1 ) / i ] = [ -64(1 + i) - 1 ] / i.\n\nSimilarly, [ ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / (-i) ] = [ (-64 (1 - i) - 1 ) / (-i) ] = [ -64(1 - i) - 1 ] / (-i).\n\nLet me compute each numerator separately:\n\nFirst numerator: -64(1 + i) -1 = -64 -64i - 1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSecond numerator: -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, the first fraction is (-65 -64i)/i, and the second is (-65 +64i)/(-i).\n\nLet me simplify each of these complex fractions.\n\nStarting with (-65 -64i)/i. To simplify, multiply numerator and denominator by -i (since 1/i = -i):\n\n(-65 -64i)/i * (-i/-i) = [ (-65 -64i)(-i) ] / (i * -i) = [ 65i +64i^2 ] / (1) because i*(-i) = -i^2 = 1.\n\nSince i^2 = -1, 64i^2 = -64. So, numerator becomes 65i -64.\n\nSo, (-65 -64i)/i = 65i -64 = (-64 +65i).\n\nSimilarly, compute (-65 +64i)/(-i). Multiply numerator and denominator by i:\n\n[ (-65 +64i) * i ] / ( (-i)*i ) = [ -65i +64i^2 ] / (1) since (-i)*i = -i^2 = 1.\n\nAgain, i^2 = -1, so 64i^2 = -64. So, numerator becomes -65i -64.\n\nSo, (-65 +64i)/(-i) = -65i -64 = (-64 -65i).\n\nNow, the entire product is [ (-64 +65i) ] * [ (-64 -65i) ].\n\nThis looks like the product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is the square of the modulus.\n\nSo, | (-64 +65i) |^2 = (-64)^2 + (65)^2 = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.",

Let me verify that.\n\nYes, since \u03c9^k for k=0 to 12 are the 13th roots of unity, so their product is x^{13} - 1 = product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k). So, product_{k=1}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = (x^{13} - 1)/(x - 1).\n\nSo, in our case, for x = (1 + i), the product from k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) is equal to ((1 + i)^{13} - 1)/( (1 + i) - 1 ). Similarly, for x = (1 - i), it's ((1 - i)^{13} - 1)/( (1 - i) - 1 ).\n\nTherefore, the entire product is [ ((1 + i)^{13} - 1)/( (1 + i - 1) ) ] multiplied by [ ((1 - i)^{13} - 1)/( (1 - i - 1) ) ].\n\nSimplify the denominators:\n\n(1 + i - 1) = i, and (1 - i - 1) = -i.

Similarly, 1/(-i) = i.\n\nSo, each term can be rewritten:\n\nFirst term: [ ((1 + i)^{13} - 1) * (-i) ]\n\nSecond term: [ ((1 - i)^{13} - 1) * i ]\n\nSo the entire product is [ ((1 + i)^{13} - 1) * (-i) ] * [ ((1 - i)^{13} - 1) * i ].\n\nMultiply the constants: (-i) * i = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So, the constants multiply to 1. Thus, the product simplifies to [ ((1 + i)^{13} - 1) * ((1 - i)^{13} - 1) ].\n\nSo now, I need to compute ((1 + i)^{13} - 1) * ((1 - i)^{13} - 1).\n\nHmm, that's still a bit complex. Let me compute (1 + i)^{13} and (1 - i)^{13} separately.\n\nFirst, note that (1 + i) is a complex number. Its magnitude is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and its angle (argument) is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle -\u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, when we raise (1 + i) to the 13th power, using De Moivre's theorem, it becomes (sqrt(2))^13 * (cos(13\u03c0/4) + i sin(13\u03c0/4)).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 is (sqrt(2))^13 * (cos(-13\u03c0/4) + i sin(-13\u03c0/4)).\n\nBut cos is even and sin is odd, so cos(-13\u03c0/4) = cos(13\u03c0/4), and sin(-13\u03c0/4) = -sin(13\u03c0/4).\n\nSo, let's compute (sqrt(2))^13 first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ cos(13\u03c0/4) + i sin(13\u03c0/4) ]\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ cos(13\u03c0/4) - i sin(13\u03c0/4) ]\n\nNow, let's compute cos(13\u03c0/4) and sin(13\u03c0/4).\n\n13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, since 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4.",

Now, I just need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, then plug them into this expression.\n\nFirst, let's compute (1 + i)^13. I know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is \u221a(1^2 + 1^2) = \u221a2. The argument is arctangent(1/1) = \u03c0/4. So, 1 + i = \u221a2 e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (\u221a2)^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) is the conjugate of (1 + i), so its modulus is also \u221a2, and its argument is -\u03c0/4. So, (1 - i)^13 = (\u221a2)^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (\u221a2)^13.

Let me compute 13 * \u03c0/4 modulo 2\u03c0, since angles are periodic with 2\u03c0.\n\n13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0.

          "text1": "Wait, but in our case, each factor is (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) multiplied by (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)). So, for each k, we have two factors. So, the entire product is the product over k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nThat is, the product can be written as [product over k=0 to12 (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] multiplied by [product over k=0 to12 (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\nEach of these products is equal to - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) and similarly for (1 - i). Let me write that down.\n\nSo, let me denote a = 1 + i and b = 1 - i.\n\nThen, product over k=0 to12 (\u03c9^k - a) = - (a^13 - 1)/(a - 1). Similarly, product over k=0 to12 (\u03c9^k - b) = - (b^13 -1)/(b -1).\n\nTherefore, the total product is [ - (a^13 -1)/(a -1) ] * [ - (b^13 -1)/(b -1) ] = [ (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1) ] / [ (a -1)(b -1) ].\n\nSo, the product becomes ( (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1) ) divided by ( (a -1)(b -1) ).\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute a = 1 + i and b = 1 - i.\n\nCompute a -1 = i and b -1 = -i. So, (a -1)(b -1) = (i)(-i) = -i\u00b2 = -(-1) = 1.\n\nSo, the denominator is 1. That's convenient.\n\nSo, the product simplifies to (a^13 - 1)(b^13 -1).\n\nNow, let's compute (a^13 -1) and (b^13 -1).\n\nBut a = 1 + i. Let's compute a^13.\n\nFirst, let's compute a in polar form. 1 + i has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4. So, a = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, a^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly for b = 1 - i, which is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}. So, b^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, compute the exponents e^{i *13\u03c0/4} and e^{-i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\n13\u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Since 13/4 = 3 + 1/4, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But angles are periodic modulo 2\u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0*(1) = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{i *5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i *5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, a^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) ) ].\n\nCompute that: 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (- (2)/2 ) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the other term is 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) ) = same as above, so a^13 = -64(1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, compute b^13: 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i) ) ].\n\nSame computation: 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -64, so b^13 = -64(1 - i).\n\nTherefore, a^13 -1 = -64(1 + i) -1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, b^13 -1 = -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, the product (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1) = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i). That looks like the product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's | -65 -64i |\u00b2.\n\nWhich is (-65)^2 + (64)^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n(-65)^2 = 4225\n\n64^2 = 4096\n\nSo total is 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nTherefore, the product is 8321.",

So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the exponents:\n\ne^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i*(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * e^{i3\u03c0} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * (-1), because e^{i\u03c0} = -1, so e^{i3\u03c0} = (e^{i\u03c0})^3 = (-1)^3 = -1.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i*(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{-i\u03c0/4} * e^{-i3\u03c0} = e^{-i\u03c0/4} * (-1).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-1) * e^{i\u03c0/4} = -64 sqrt(2) * (cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4)) = -64 sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = -64 sqrt(2) * ( (1 + i)/sqrt(2) ) = -64 (1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-1) * e^{-i\u03c0/4} = -64 sqrt(2) * (cos(-\u03c0/4) + i sin(-\u03c0/4)) = -64 sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = -64 sqrt(2) * ( (1 - i)/sqrt(2) ) = -64 (1 - i).\n\nSo, now, (1 + i)^13 = -64 (1 + i), and (1 - i)^13 = -64 (1 - i).\n\nSo, substituting back into the expression:\n\n[ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / i ] = [ (-64 (1 + i) - 1 ) / i ] = [ -64(1 + i) - 1 ] / i.\n\nSimilarly, [ ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / (-i) ] = [ (-64 (1 - i) - 1 ) / (-i) ] = [ -64(1 - i) - 1 ] / (-i).\n\nLet me compute each numerator separately:\n\nFirst numerator: -64(1 + i) -1 = -64 -64i - 1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSecond numerator: -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, the first fraction is (-65 -64i)/i, and the second is (-65 +64i)/(-i).\n\nLet me simplify each of these complex fractions.\n\nStarting with (-65 -64i)/i. To simplify, multiply numerator and denominator by -i (since 1/i = -i):\n\n(-65 -64i)/i * (-i/-i) = [ (-65 -64i)(-i) ] / (i * -i) = [ 65i +64i^2 ] / (1) because i*(-i) = -i^2 = 1.\n\nSince i^2 = -1, 64i^2 = -64. So, numerator becomes 65i -64.\n\nSo, (-65 -64i)/i = 65i -64 = (-64 +65i).\n\nSimilarly, compute (-65 +64i)/(-i). Multiply numerator and denominator by i:\n\n[ (-65 +64i) * i ] / ( (-i)*i ) = [ -65i +64i^2 ] / (1) since (-i)*i = -i^2 = 1.\n\nAgain, i^2 = -1, so 64i^2 = -64. So, numerator becomes -65i -64.\n\nSo, (-65 +64i)/(-i) = -65i -64 = (-64 -65i).\n\nNow, the entire product is [ (-64 +65i) ] * [ (-64 -65i) ].\n\nThis looks like the product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is the square of the modulus.\n\nSo, | (-64 +65i) |^2 = (-64)^2 + (65)^2 = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.",

          "text1": "Wait, no. Actually, for prime n, \u03a6_n(x) is the product over k=1 to n-1 of (x - \u03c9^k), where \u03c9 is a primitive nth root. So, in this case, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is the product from k=1 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k). Therefore, the product over x of (x - a) is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a).\n\nSo, going back, the product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product over x of (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). Which is equal to \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i). Because for each x, it's (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)), so the product over all x is [product (x - (1 + i))] * [product (x - (1 - i))], which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).\n\nSo now, I need to compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i). Let me recall that \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. So, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(x - 1).\n\nThus, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) = (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(a - 1). Therefore, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = [(1 + i)^13 - 1]/[(1 + i) - 1] = [(1 + i)^13 - 1]/(i). Similarly, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = [(1 - i)^13 - 1]/[(1 - i) - 1] = [(1 - i)^13 - 1]/(-i).\n\nSo, let me compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) separately.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13. Let's compute powers of (1 + i). I know that (1 + i) has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4, so when raised to the 13th power, the magnitude becomes (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2). The angle becomes 13 * \u03c0/4 = (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0. But since angles are modulo 2\u03c0, 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 is \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0 = \u03c0/4 + \u03c0 = 5\u03c0/4. So, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)) = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) = 64*(-1)(1 + i) = -64(1 + i).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i). Then, (1 + i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 + i) - 1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nThen, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = ( -65 -64i ) / (i) = (-65 -64i)/i. Let me multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make it easier: (-65 -64i)(-i) / (i*(-i)) = (65i + 64i\u00b2) / 1 = 65i + 64*(-1) = 65i -64.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = -64 + 65i.\n\nSimilarly, compute (1 - i)^13. Since (1 - i) is the conjugate of (1 + i), so its magnitude is also sqrt(2), but angle is -\u03c0/4. Raising to 13th power, magnitude is 2^(13/2) same as before, 64*sqrt(2). The angle becomes 13*(-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4. Adding multiples of 2\u03c0 to bring it within [0, 2\u03c0): Let's see, -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0 + 16\u03c0)/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So, the angle is 3\u03c0/4. So, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) [ cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) ] = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i) = 64*(-1)(1 - i) = -64(1 - i).\n\nTherefore, (1 - i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nThen, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = ( -65 +64i ) / ( -i ) = ( -65 +64i ) / (-i). Multiply numerator and denominator by i: (-65 +64i)i / (-i^2) = (-65i +64i\u00b2)/1 = (-65i -64)/1 = -64 -65i.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = -64 -65i.\n\nNow, the product \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) is equal to (-64 +65i)(-64 -65i). Let me compute that. It's a product of complex conjugates, so it's equal to (-64)^2 + (65)^2. Compute that:\n\n64\u00b2 = 4096, 65\u00b2=4225. So, 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. Therefore, the original product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is equal to 8321.",
          "text2": "Wait, no, actually, that's the cyclotomic polynomial when p is prime. So, \u03a6_p(x) = (x^p - 1)/(x - 1) = x^{p-1} + x^{p-2} + ... + x + 1.\n\nSo, correct, \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + 1.\n\nTherefore, product_{k=1}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + 1.\n\nSo, in our case, if we set x = (1 + i), then product_{k=1}^{12} ( (1 + i) - \u03c9^k ) = \u03a6_13(1 + i), and similarly for (1 - i), product is \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\nThus, P = \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\nSo, I need to compute \u03a6_13(1 + i) and \u03a6_13(1 - i), then multiply them, and that will give me the product P.\n\nHmm, okay, so let me remember that \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. So, for a general x, \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1).\n\nSo, for x = 1 + i, \u03a6_13(1 + i) = ((1 + i)^13 - 1)/( (1 + i) -1 ) = ((1 + i)^13 - 1)/i.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = ((1 - i)^13 - 1)/( (1 - i) -1 ) = ((1 - i)^13 - 1)/(-i).\n\nSo, let me compute \u03a6_13(1 + i) and \u03a6_13(1 - i) separately.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13.\n\nI know that 1 + i can be represented in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(2), and its argument is \u03c0/4. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}. Let's compute 13 * \u03c0/4 modulo 2\u03c0.\n\n13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0. So, angle is \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nCompute this: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = same as above, so also -64i.",

Calculated (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 correctly? Let me check:\n\n(1 + i) in polar form: magnitude sqrt(2), angle \u03c0/4. Raising to 13th power: (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 sqrt(2). Angle: 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is \u03c0/4 more than 3\u03c0, but 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0. So, 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0, so modulo 2\u03c0, it's \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, the angle is 5\u03c0/4. Therefore, (1 + i)^13 is 64 sqrt(2) [cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)].\n\ncos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, multiply by 64 sqrt(2):\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = -64\n\nSimilarly, 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 i) = -64i. So, together, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for (1 - i)^13:\n\nAngle is -13\u03c0/4.

As I noted earlier, since product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1, so product_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k) = c\u00b9\u00b3 - 1.

So, in our case, since we have two such products for a and b, the total product is [ - (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1) ] * [ - (b\u00b9\u00b3 - 1) ] = (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)(b\u00b9\u00b3 - 1).\n\nSo now, substituting a = 1 + i and b = 1 - i, we need to compute ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ).\n\nHmm, okay, let's compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13. Perhaps using De Moivre's theorem.\n\n1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4 radians. So 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) and argument -\u03c0/4, so 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^{13}: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the exponentials: e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i*(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * e^{i3\u03c0} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * (-1), since e^{i3\u03c0} = e^{i\u03c0} = -1.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i*(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{-i\u03c0/4} * e^{-i3\u03c0} = e^{-i\u03c0/4} * (-1).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4} * (-1) = -64 sqrt(2) [cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4)].\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4} * (-1) = -64 sqrt(2) [cos(\u03c0/4) - i sin(\u03c0/4)].\n\nCompute cos(\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2, sin(\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 + i)^13 = -64 sqrt(2) [ sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ] = -64 sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 (1 + i ) = -64 * (2)/2 (1 + i ) = -64 (1 + i).\n\nSimilarly,\n\n(1 - i)^13 = -64 sqrt(2) [ sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ] = -64 sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 (1 - i ) = -64 (1 - i).\n\nSo, both (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 are equal to -64 (1 + i) and -64 (1 - i) respectively.\n\nNow, let's compute (1 + i)^13 - 1 and (1 - i)^13 -1.\n\n(1 + i)^13 -1 = -64(1 + i) - 1 = -64 -64i - 1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 -1 = -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, the product is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i).

So, 13\u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, cos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nTherefore, A = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 i) = 64 * (-2)/2 i = -64i.\n\nSo, A = (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, B = (1 - i)^13.\n\nAgain, modulus is sqrt(2)^13 = 2^{13/2} = same as A, which is 64*sqrt(2).\n\nThe angle is 13*(-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4.

So, a = 1 + i, b = 1 - i.\n\nSo, now, we need to compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(b). Since \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. So, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) = a\u00b9\u00b2 + a\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + a + 1, same with \u03a6\u2081\u2083(b).\n\nBut computing a\u00b9\u00b2 + a\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + a + 1 for a = 1 + i seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach. Let me think.",

Let me double-check the steps.\n\nFirst, I converted the term (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) into a quadratic in \u03c9^k, factoring it as (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)). Then, since the product over all \u03c9^k of (\u03c9^k - a) is equal to - (a^{13} -1 ), I substituted a = 1 + i and a = 1 - i, leading to the product being [ (1 + i)^13 -1 ][ (1 - i)^13 -1 ].\n\nThen, I calculated (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 using polar forms, each resulting in -64 -64i and -64 +64i, respectively.

Then the product over all k from 0 to 12 becomes the product of [(1 + i)^13 -1] and [(1 - i)^13 -1]. Then, (1 + i)^13 was calculated as -64(1 + i), so subtracting 1 gives -65 -64i.

Correct.\n\n13\u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is the same as \u03c0/4 but in the third quadrant because 13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is equivalent to 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4, which is in the third quadrant. So, cos(5\u03c0/4) is -\u221a2/2, and sin is -\u221a2/2. So, e^{i5\u03c0/4} = (-\u221a2/2) - i\u221a2/2. So, when multiplied by 64\u221a2, that gives 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2). Let's compute 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2) = 64 * ( (-\u221a2 * \u221a2)/2 ) = 64*(-2/2) = 64*(-1) = -64. Similarly, for the imaginary part: 64\u221a2 * (-i\u221a2/2) = 64*(-i*(2)/2) = 64*(-i) = -64i. So, overall, (1 + i)^13 = (-64 -64i). Subtract 1, gives (-65 -64i). Correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) is \u221a2 e^{-i\u03c0/4}, so (1 - i)^13 is (\u221a2)^13 e^{-i13\u03c0/4} = 64\u221a2 e^{-i5\u03c0/4}. e^{-i5\u03c0/4} is cos(-5\u03c0/4) + i sin(-5\u03c0/4) = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2) + i\u221a2/2. So, 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2) = 64*(-1) + 64i = (-64 + 64i). Subtract 1 gives (-65 +64i). Correct.\n\nThen, the product (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (64^2)(i^2) = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nTherefore, the remainder is 321. So, I think that's the answer.",

That seems correct because x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 factors into (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\n2. Then, the product becomes two separate products: [product over (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [product over (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\n3.

Angle: 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is \u03c0/4 more than 3\u03c0, but 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0. So, 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0, so modulo 2\u03c0, it's \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, the angle is 5\u03c0/4. Therefore, (1 + i)^13 is 64 sqrt(2) [cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)].\n\ncos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, multiply by 64 sqrt(2):\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = -64\n\nSimilarly, 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 i) = -64i.

So, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(x - 1).\n\nThus, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) = (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(a - 1). Therefore, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = [(1 + i)^13 - 1]/[(1 + i) - 1] = [(1 + i)^13 - 1]/(i). Similarly, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = [(1 - i)^13 - 1]/[(1 - i) - 1] = [(1 - i)^13 - 1]/(-i).\n\nSo, let me compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) separately.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13. Let's compute powers of (1 + i). I know that (1 + i) has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4, so when raised to the 13th power, the magnitude becomes (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2). The angle becomes 13 * \u03c0/4 = (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0. But since angles are modulo 2\u03c0, 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 is \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0 = \u03c0/4 + \u03c0 = 5\u03c0/4. So, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)) = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) = 64*(-1)(1 + i) = -64(1 + i).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i). Then, (1 + i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 + i) - 1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nThen, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = ( -65 -64i ) / (i) = (-65 -64i)/i. Let me multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make it easier: (-65 -64i)(-i) / (i*(-i)) = (65i + 64i\u00b2) / 1 = 65i + 64*(-1) = 65i -64.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = -64 + 65i.\n\nSimilarly, compute (1 - i)^13. Since (1 - i) is the conjugate of (1 + i), so its magnitude is also sqrt(2), but angle is -\u03c0/4. Raising to 13th power, magnitude is 2^(13/2) same as before, 64*sqrt(2). The angle becomes 13*(-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4. Adding multiples of 2\u03c0 to bring it within [0, 2\u03c0): Let's see, -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0 + 16\u03c0)/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So, the angle is 3\u03c0/4. So, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) [ cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) ] = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i) = 64*(-1)(1 - i) = -64(1 - i).\n\nTherefore, (1 - i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nThen, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = ( -65 +64i ) / ( -i ) = ( -65 +64i ) / (-i). Multiply numerator and denominator by i: (-65 +64i)i / (-i^2) = (-65i +64i\u00b2)/1 = (-65i -64)/1 = -64 -65i.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = -64 -65i.\n\nNow, the product \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) is equal to (-64 +65i)(-64 -65i). Let me compute that. It's a product of complex conjugates, so it's equal to (-64)^2 + (65)^2. Compute that:\n\n64\u00b2 = 4096, 65\u00b2=4225. So, 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. Therefore, the original product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is equal to 8321.",

The argument is \u03c0/4 radians because it's in the first quadrant.\n\nSo, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, raising to the 13th power:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^{13}. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the exponential terms. 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is the same as \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0. Since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i*(13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0*1)} = e^{i*(13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4)} = e^{i*(5\u03c0/4)}.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i*13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i*(5\u03c0/4)}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{i*5\u03c0/4} and (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{-i*5\u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, e^{i*5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i(sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i*5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i(sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, let's compute (1 + i)^13:\n\n64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i(sqrt(2)/2) ] = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) * (1 + i).",

But is that correct?\n\nLet me double-check that. The term (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is equal to (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2), which is equal to (\u03c9^k)^2 - 2\u03c9^k + 2. Let me let z = \u03c9^k, so it's z^2 - 2z + 2 = (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)).\n\nYes, that's correct because (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)) = z\u00b2 - (1 + i + 1 - i)z + (1 + i)(1 - i) = z\u00b2 - 2z + (1 + 1) = z\u00b2 - 2z + 2.

Since 13 is odd, (-1)^13 = -1, so \u220f_{\u03b1_i} (\u03b1_i - c) = (-1)^{13} f(c) = -f(c).\n\nSo, \u220f_{\u03b1_i} (\u03b1_i - c) = (-1)^{13} f(c) = -f(c).\n\nTherefore, \u220f_{\u03b1_i} (\u03b1_i - (1+i)) = -f(1+i) and \u220f_{\u03b1_i} (\u03b1_i - (1-i)) = -f(1-i).\n\nSo, P = [ -f(1+i) ] * [ -f(1-i) ] = f(1+i) * f(1-i).\n\nSo, f(z) = z^13 -1, so f(1+i) = (1+i)^13 -1 and f(1-i) = (1-i)^13 -1.\n\nSo, P = [(1+i)^13 -1] * [(1-i)^13 -1].\n\nSo, now I need to compute (1+i)^13 and (1-i)^13.\n\nHmm, 1+i and 1-i are complex conjugates, and they have magnitude sqrt(2) and angles \u03c0/4 and -\u03c0/4 respectively.\n\nSo, (1+i) can be written as sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}, and (1-i) as sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1+i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1-i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, 13\u03c0/4: Let's compute 13\u03c0/4 modulo 2\u03c0. Since 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is more than 2\u03c0, so subtract 2\u03c0: 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0. So, 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{i *5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i *5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 (1 + i)).\n\nSimplify sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = 2, so:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part would be 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2 i) = 64*(-1)i = -64i.",

Because (x - 1)(x - \u03c9)(x - \u03c9^2)...(x - \u03c9^12) = x^13 - 1.\n\nSo, in that case, the product over all \u03b1_k of (x - \u03b1_k) is x^13 -1. So, maybe the product over all \u03b1_k of (c - \u03b1_k) is c^13 -1.\n\nTherefore, the product over all \u03b1_k of (\u03b1_k^2 - 2\u03b1_k + 2) is the same as the product over all \u03b1_k of (\u03b1_k^2 - 2\u03b1_k + 2). Let me write this as product (\u03b1_k^2 - 2\u03b1_k + 2) = product (\u03b1_k^2 - 2\u03b1_k + 2). Hmm, perhaps I can factor this as product ( (\u03b1_k - a)(\u03b1_k - b) ), where a and b are roots of x^2 - 2x + 2 = 0.\n\nLet me find the roots of f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. Using quadratic formula: x = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So, a = 1 + i, b = 1 - i.\n\nTherefore, product (\u03b1_k^2 - 2\u03b1_k + 2) = product (\u03b1_k - a)(\u03b1_k - b) = [product (\u03b1_k - a)] * [product (\u03b1_k - b)].\n\nBut, as I thought earlier, the product over all \u03b1_k of (x - \u03b1_k) is x^13 -1. So, product (\u03b1_k - a) is (a^13 -1), and product (\u03b1_k - b) is (b^13 -1). Therefore, the entire product is (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1).\n\nSo, substituting a = 1 + i and b = 1 - i, we get:\n\nProduct = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 )\n\nSo, this simplifies our problem to computing (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, subtracting 1 from each, multiplying them together, and then taking the result modulo 1000.\n\nNow, let's compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13. To do this, we can express (1 + i) in polar form. Let's compute the modulus and argument.\n\nThe modulus of (1 + i) is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is arctan(1/1) = \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * (cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4)) = sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) and argument -\u03c0/4, so 1 - i = sqrt(2) e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet's compute (sqrt(2))^13. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents e^{i 13\u03c0/4} and e^{-i 13\u03c0/4}. Let's note that 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 * 1 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Similarly, -13\u03c0/4 is the same as -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0 + 16\u03c0)/4 = 3\u03c0/4.",

So b^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} e^{-i 13\u03c0/4}.\n\n13\u03c0/4 is 5\u03c0/4 as before, but since it's negative, e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i 5\u03c0/4}, which is cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i*(-sqrt(2)/2) )= -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo b^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)/2 ( -1 + i ) = 64*(-1 + i).\n\nSo (b^13 - 1) = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo the numerator becomes (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nDenominator is (a - 1)(b - 1) = (i)(-i) = (-i\u00b2) = 1.\n\nSo \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(b) = 8321.\n\nSo the product is 8321.

So, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = - (a^{13} - 1).\n\nSo, applying that to our case, the first product is product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = - [ (1 + i)^{13} - 1 ].\n\nSimilarly, the second product is product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = - [ (1 - i)^{13} - 1 ].\n\nTherefore, the entire product is [ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] multiplied by [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nSimplify the signs: (-1) * (-1) = 1, so the product becomes [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nHmm, okay. So now I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, then plug them into this expression.\n\nFirst, let's compute (1 + i)^13. I know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is arctan(1/1) = \u03c0/4. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) has modulus sqrt(2), and argument -\u03c0/4. So, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet's compute (sqrt(2))^{13}. Since sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents. For (1 + i)^13, the angle is 13\u03c0/4. Let's simplify that.\n\n13\u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Because 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 3*\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But angles are periodic modulo 2\u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Similarly, 5\u03c0/4 is in the third quadrant.\n\nSimilarly, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nLet's compute that. Multiplying 64 * sqrt(2) by (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2):\n\nFirst, sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = ( - (2)/2 ) = -1.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2 ) = -i (2)/2 = -i.\n\nSo, multiplying by 64: 64 * (-1 - i) = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nCompute that: sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ) = (-1 + i).\n\nMultiply by 64: 64*(-1 + i) = -64 + 64i.\n\nSo, now we have:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i,\n\n(1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nNow, plug these into our expression:\n\n[ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ] =\n\n[ (-64 - 64i - 1 ) * (-64 + 64i - 1 ) ] =\n\n[ (-65 - 64i ) * (-65 + 64i ) ].\n\nThis is a product of the form (a - b)(a + b) where a = -65 and b = 64i.

So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2), and argument -\u03c0/4, so 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute [sqrt(2)]^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so [2^{1/2}]^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2). So, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4} and e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSince 13 * \u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, because 13 divided by 4 is 3 with remainder 1, so 3*2\u03c0 = 6\u03c0 is more than 13\u03c0/4, but wait, wait, 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, because 3\u03c0 is 12\u03c0/4, so adding \u03c0/4 gives 13\u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is more than \u03c0, so we can subtract multiples of 2\u03c0 to get the angle within 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\nCompute 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i * 5\u03c0/4}.",

Let me rearrange that: it's \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2. So each term is a quadratic in \u03c9^k.\n\nNow, since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, we know that the minimal polynomial for \u03c9 is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. Because \u03a6_n(x) is the product of (x - \u03c9^k) where \u03c9^k are primitive nth roots of unity, but in this case, since 13 is prime, all \u03c9^k for k=1 to 12 are primitive.\n\nBut in our product, we have terms for k=0 as well, which is 1, so maybe I can separate that. The product from k=0 to 12 is equal to the product from k=1 to 12 times the term at k=0, which is 1. So the product is just the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).",

So, now I have to compute this expression. Let's compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nI remember that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. Let me compute its magnitude and angle.\n\nThe magnitude of 1 + i is sqrt(1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2) = sqrt(2). The angle (argument) is \u03c0/4 radians because it's on the line y = x in the first quadrant.\n\nSo, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.

Let's compute this modulo 2\u03c0 to find the equivalent angle between 0 and 2\u03c0.\n\n13/4 = 3 + 1/4, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. 3\u03c0 is equal to \u03c0 + 2\u03c0, so subtracting 2\u03c0 gives \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, angle is 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, -13\u03c0/4 = - (13/4 \u03c0). Let's compute this modulo 2\u03c0.\n\n13/4 \u03c0 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, so subtracting multiples of 2\u03c0:\n\n13/4 \u03c0 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 2\u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0/4. So, subtract 2\u03c0, which leaves \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. But since it's negative, we have -13\u03c0/4 = -5\u03c0/4. To find the equivalent positive angle, add 2\u03c0: -5\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i3\u03c0/4} = cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nTherefore,\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ]\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nMultiply 64 sqrt(2) with each term inside:\n\nFirst term: 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * [ (-2)/2 ] = 64 * (-1) = -64\n\nSecond term: 64 sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64 * [ (-2i)/2 ] = 64 * (-i) = -64i\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ]\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = -64\n\nSecond term: 64 sqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (2i)/2 = 64i\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i\n\nNow, substitute back into the Product expression:\n\nProduct = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ]\n\n= [ (-64 - 64i) - 1 ] * [ (-64 + 64i) - 1 ]\n\nSimplify each bracket:\n\nFirst bracket: (-64 - 64i - 1) = (-65 - 64i)\n\nSecond bracket: (-64 + 64i - 1) = (-65 + 64i)\n\nSo, Product = (-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i)\n\nThis is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's equal to the square of the modulus.",

Since 1 + i has magnitude \u221a2 and angle \u03c0/4. So, (1 + i) = \u221a2 e^{i\u03c0/4}.

So, e^{i13\u03c0/4} = e^{i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2).\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64\u221a2 \u00d7 (-\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2) = 64\u221a2 \u00d7 (-\u221a2/2)(1 + i). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, \u221a2 \u00d7 \u221a2 is 2. So, 64\u221a2 \u00d7 (-\u221a2/2) = 64 \u00d7 (-2/2) = 64 \u00d7 (-1) = -64. So, that's the magnitude.

So, numerator becomes 65i -64.\n\nSo, (-65 -64i)/i = 65i -64 = (-64 +65i).\n\nSimilarly, compute (-65 +64i)/(-i). Multiply numerator and denominator by i:\n\n[ (-65 +64i) * i ] / ( (-i)*i ) = [ -65i +64i^2 ] / (1) since (-i)*i = -i^2 = 1.\n\nAgain, i^2 = -1, so 64i^2 = -64. So, numerator becomes -65i -64.\n\nSo, (-65 +64i)/(-i) = -65i -64 = (-64 -65i).\n\nNow, the entire product is [ (-64 +65i) ] * [ (-64 -65i) ].\n\nThis looks like the product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is the square of the modulus.\n\nSo, | (-64 +65i) |^2 = (-64)^2 + (65)^2 = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.",
          "text2": "Wait, but the product over all k=1 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k) is equal to (x^{13} - 1)/(x - 1), because the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is x^{13} - 1, and we're excluding k=0, so it's (x^{13} - 1)/(x - 1). Let me verify that.\n\nYes, since \u03c9^k for k=0 to 12 are the 13th roots of unity, so their product is x^{13} - 1 = product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k). So, product_{k=1}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = (x^{13} - 1)/(x - 1).\n\nSo, in our case, for x = (1 + i), the product from k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) is equal to ((1 + i)^{13} - 1)/( (1 + i) - 1 ). Similarly, for x = (1 - i), it's ((1 - i)^{13} - 1)/( (1 - i) - 1 ).\n\nTherefore, the entire product is [ ((1 + i)^{13} - 1)/( (1 + i - 1) ) ] multiplied by [ ((1 - i)^{13} - 1)/( (1 - i - 1) ) ].\n\nSimplify the denominators:\n\n(1 + i - 1) = i, and (1 - i - 1) = -i. So, the denominators are i and -i.\n\nSo, the product becomes [ ((1 + i)^{13} - 1)/i ] * [ ((1 - i)^{13} - 1)/(-i) ].\n\nSimplify the denominators: 1/i = -i, because i * (-i) = 1. Similarly, 1/(-i) = i.\n\nSo, each term can be rewritten:\n\nFirst term: [ ((1 + i)^{13} - 1) * (-i) ]\n\nSecond term: [ ((1 - i)^{13} - 1) * i ]\n\nSo the entire product is [ ((1 + i)^{13} - 1) * (-i) ] * [ ((1 - i)^{13} - 1) * i ].\n\nMultiply the constants: (-i) * i = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So, the constants multiply to 1. Thus, the product simplifies to [ ((1 + i)^{13} - 1) * ((1 - i)^{13} - 1) ].\n\nSo now, I need to compute ((1 + i)^{13} - 1) * ((1 - i)^{13} - 1).\n\nHmm, that's still a bit complex. Let me compute (1 + i)^{13} and (1 - i)^{13} separately.\n\nFirst, note that (1 + i) is a complex number. Its magnitude is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and its angle (argument) is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle -\u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, when we raise (1 + i) to the 13th power, using De Moivre's theorem, it becomes (sqrt(2))^13 * (cos(13\u03c0/4) + i sin(13\u03c0/4)).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 is (sqrt(2))^13 * (cos(-13\u03c0/4) + i sin(-13\u03c0/4)).\n\nBut cos is even and sin is odd, so cos(-13\u03c0/4) = cos(13\u03c0/4), and sin(-13\u03c0/4) = -sin(13\u03c0/4).\n\nSo, let's compute (sqrt(2))^13 first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ cos(13\u03c0/4) + i sin(13\u03c0/4) ]\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ cos(13\u03c0/4) - i sin(13\u03c0/4) ]\n\nNow, let's compute cos(13\u03c0/4) and sin(13\u03c0/4).\n\n13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, since 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4.",

So, \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = - (a^13 - 1) = 1 - a^13.\n\nSo, that's a useful identity.

Now, I just need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, then plug them into this expression.\n\nFirst, let's compute (1 + i)^13. I know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is \u221a(1^2 + 1^2) = \u221a2. The argument is arctangent(1/1) = \u03c0/4. So, 1 + i = \u221a2 e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (\u221a2)^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) is the conjugate of (1 + i), so its modulus is also \u221a2, and its argument is -\u03c0/4. So, (1 - i)^13 = (\u221a2)^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (\u221a2)^13.

Let me compute 13 * \u03c0/4 modulo 2\u03c0, since angles are periodic with 2\u03c0.\n\n13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0. But 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0, because 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0. So, 13\u03c0/4 is \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 has an angle of -13\u03c0/4. Let's compute that modulo 2\u03c0. -13\u03c0/4 can be converted by adding multiples of 2\u03c0 until it's positive. 2\u03c0 is 8\u03c0/4, so adding 3*(8\u03c0/4)=24\u03c0/4 gives us (-13\u03c0/4 + 24\u03c0/4) = 11\u03c0/4.",

Similarly, product over k=0 to12 (\u03c9^k - b) = - (b^13 -1)/(b -1).\n\nTherefore, the total product is [ - (a^13 -1)/(a -1) ] * [ - (b^13 -1)/(b -1) ] = [ (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1) ] / [ (a -1)(b -1) ].\n\nSo, the product becomes ( (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1) ) divided by ( (a -1)(b -1) ).\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute a = 1 + i and b = 1 - i.\n\nCompute a -1 = i and b -1 = -i. So, (a -1)(b -1) = (i)(-i) = -i\u00b2 = -(-1) = 1.\n\nSo, the denominator is 1. That's convenient.\n\nSo, the product simplifies to (a^13 - 1)(b^13 -1).\n\nNow, let's compute (a^13 -1) and (b^13 -1).\n\nBut a = 1 + i. Let's compute a^13.\n\nFirst, let's compute a in polar form. 1 + i has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4. So, a = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, a^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly for b = 1 - i, which is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}. So, b^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, compute the exponents e^{i *13\u03c0/4} and e^{-i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\n13\u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Since 13/4 = 3 + 1/4, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But angles are periodic modulo 2\u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0*(1) = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{i *5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i *5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, a^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) ) ].\n\nCompute that: 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (- (2)/2 ) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the other term is 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) ) = same as above, so a^13 = -64(1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, compute b^13: 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i) ) ].\n\nSame computation: 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -64, so b^13 = -64(1 - i).\n\nTherefore, a^13 -1 = -64(1 + i) -1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, b^13 -1 = -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, the product (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1) = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i). That looks like the product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's | -65 -64i |\u00b2.\n\nWhich is (-65)^2 + (64)^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n(-65)^2 = 4225\n\n64^2 = 4096\n\nSo total is 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nTherefore, the product is 8321.",
          "text2": "But wait, in this case, the product is from k=1 to 12, so it's the product over all non-1 roots.

So, here, x is replaced by (1 + i) and (1 - i) respectively.\n\nSo, for the first product, x = 1 + i: \u220f_{k=1}^{12} ( (1 + i) - \u03c9^k ) = [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) ].\n\nSimilarly, for the second product, x = 1 - i: \u220f_{k=1}^{12} ( (1 - i) - \u03c9^k ) = [ ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) ].\n\nSo, the entire product is [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) ] * [ ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) ].\n\nSimplify the denominators first:\n\nDenominator for x = 1 + i: (1 + i) - 1 = i.\n\nDenominator for x = 1 - i: (1 - i) - 1 = -i.\n\nSo, now the expression becomes [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / i ] * [ ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / (-i) ].\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nI know that 1 + i can be represented in polar form. |1 + i| = sqrt(2), and the angle (argument) is \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the exponents:\n\ne^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i*(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * e^{i3\u03c0} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * (-1), because e^{i\u03c0} = -1, so e^{i3\u03c0} = (e^{i\u03c0})^3 = (-1)^3 = -1.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i*(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{-i\u03c0/4} * e^{-i3\u03c0} = e^{-i\u03c0/4} * (-1).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-1) * e^{i\u03c0/4} = -64 sqrt(2) * (cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4)) = -64 sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = -64 sqrt(2) * ( (1 + i)/sqrt(2) ) = -64 (1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-1) * e^{-i\u03c0/4} = -64 sqrt(2) * (cos(-\u03c0/4) + i sin(-\u03c0/4)) = -64 sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = -64 sqrt(2) * ( (1 - i)/sqrt(2) ) = -64 (1 - i).\n\nSo, now, (1 + i)^13 = -64 (1 + i), and (1 - i)^13 = -64 (1 - i).\n\nSo, substituting back into the expression:\n\n[ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / i ] = [ (-64 (1 + i) - 1 ) / i ] = [ -64(1 + i) - 1 ] / i.\n\nSimilarly, [ ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / (-i) ] = [ (-64 (1 - i) - 1 ) / (-i) ] = [ -64(1 - i) - 1 ] / (-i).\n\nLet me compute each numerator separately:\n\nFirst numerator: -64(1 + i) -1 = -64 -64i - 1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSecond numerator: -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, the first fraction is (-65 -64i)/i, and the second is (-65 +64i)/(-i).\n\nLet me simplify each of these complex fractions.\n\nStarting with (-65 -64i)/i. To simplify, multiply numerator and denominator by -i (since 1/i = -i):\n\n(-65 -64i)/i * (-i/-i) = [ (-65 -64i)(-i) ] / (i * -i) = [ 65i +64i^2 ] / (1) because i*(-i) = -i^2 = 1.\n\nSince i^2 = -1, 64i^2 = -64. So, numerator becomes 65i -64.\n\nSo, (-65 -64i)/i = 65i -64 = (-64 +65i).\n\nSimilarly, compute (-65 +64i)/(-i). Multiply numerator and denominator by i:\n\n[ (-65 +64i) * i ] / ( (-i)*i ) = [ -65i +64i^2 ] / (1) since (-i)*i = -i^2 = 1.\n\nAgain, i^2 = -1, so 64i^2 = -64. So, numerator becomes -65i -64.\n\nSo, (-65 +64i)/(-i) = -65i -64 = (-64 -65i).\n\nNow, the entire product is [ (-64 +65i) ] * [ (-64 -65i) ].\n\nThis looks like the product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is the square of the modulus.\n\nSo, | (-64 +65i) |^2 = (-64)^2 + (65)^2 = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.",

          "text1": "Wait, no. Actually, for prime n, \u03a6_n(x) is the product over k=1 to n-1 of (x - \u03c9^k), where \u03c9 is a primitive nth root. So, in this case, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is the product from k=1 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k). Therefore, the product over x of (x - a) is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a).\n\nSo, going back, the product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product over x of (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). Which is equal to \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i). Because for each x, it's (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)), so the product over all x is [product (x - (1 + i))] * [product (x - (1 - i))], which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).\n\nSo now, I need to compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i). Let me recall that \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. So, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(x - 1).\n\nThus, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) = (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(a - 1). Therefore, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = [(1 + i)^13 - 1]/[(1 + i) - 1] = [(1 + i)^13 - 1]/(i). Similarly, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = [(1 - i)^13 - 1]/[(1 - i) - 1] = [(1 - i)^13 - 1]/(-i).\n\nSo, let me compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) separately.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13. Let's compute powers of (1 + i). I know that (1 + i) has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4, so when raised to the 13th power, the magnitude becomes (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2). The angle becomes 13 * \u03c0/4 = (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0. But since angles are modulo 2\u03c0, 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 is \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0 = \u03c0/4 + \u03c0 = 5\u03c0/4. So, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)) = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) = 64*(-1)(1 + i) = -64(1 + i).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i). Then, (1 + i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 + i) - 1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nThen, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = ( -65 -64i ) / (i) = (-65 -64i)/i. Let me multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make it easier: (-65 -64i)(-i) / (i*(-i)) = (65i + 64i\u00b2) / 1 = 65i + 64*(-1) = 65i -64.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = -64 + 65i.\n\nSimilarly, compute (1 - i)^13. Since (1 - i) is the conjugate of (1 + i), so its magnitude is also sqrt(2), but angle is -\u03c0/4. Raising to 13th power, magnitude is 2^(13/2) same as before, 64*sqrt(2). The angle becomes 13*(-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4. Adding multiples of 2\u03c0 to bring it within [0, 2\u03c0): Let's see, -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0 + 16\u03c0)/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So, the angle is 3\u03c0/4. So, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) [ cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) ] = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i) = 64*(-1)(1 - i) = -64(1 - i).\n\nTherefore, (1 - i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nThen, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = ( -65 +64i ) / ( -i ) = ( -65 +64i ) / (-i). Multiply numerator and denominator by i: (-65 +64i)i / (-i^2) = (-65i +64i\u00b2)/1 = (-65i -64)/1 = -64 -65i.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = -64 -65i.\n\nNow, the product \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) is equal to (-64 +65i)(-64 -65i). Let me compute that. It's a product of complex conjugates, so it's equal to (-64)^2 + (65)^2. Compute that:\n\n64\u00b2 = 4096, 65\u00b2=4225. So, 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. Therefore, the original product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is equal to 8321.",
          "text2": "Wait, no, actually, that's the cyclotomic polynomial when p is prime. So, \u03a6_p(x) = (x^p - 1)/(x - 1) = x^{p-1} + x^{p-2} + ... + x + 1.\n\nSo, correct, \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + 1.\n\nTherefore, product_{k=1}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + 1.\n\nSo, in our case, if we set x = (1 + i), then product_{k=1}^{12} ( (1 + i) - \u03c9^k ) = \u03a6_13(1 + i), and similarly for (1 - i), product is \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\nThus, P = \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\nSo, I need to compute \u03a6_13(1 + i) and \u03a6_13(1 - i), then multiply them, and that will give me the product P.\n\nHmm, okay, so let me remember that \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. So, for a general x, \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1).\n\nSo, for x = 1 + i, \u03a6_13(1 + i) = ((1 + i)^13 - 1)/( (1 + i) -1 ) = ((1 + i)^13 - 1)/i.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = ((1 - i)^13 - 1)/( (1 - i) -1 ) = ((1 - i)^13 - 1)/(-i).\n\nSo, let me compute \u03a6_13(1 + i) and \u03a6_13(1 - i) separately.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13.\n\nI know that 1 + i can be represented in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(2), and its argument is \u03c0/4. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}. Let's compute 13 * \u03c0/4 modulo 2\u03c0.\n\n13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0. So, angle is \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nCompute this: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = same as above, so also -64i.",

That seems correct because x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 factors into (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\n2.

Calculated (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 correctly? Let me check:\n\n(1 + i) in polar form: magnitude sqrt(2), angle \u03c0/4. Raising to 13th power: (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 sqrt(2). Angle: 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is \u03c0/4 more than 3\u03c0, but 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0. So, 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0, so modulo 2\u03c0, it's \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, the angle is 5\u03c0/4. Therefore, (1 + i)^13 is 64 sqrt(2) [cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)].\n\ncos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, multiply by 64 sqrt(2):\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = -64\n\nSimilarly, 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 i) = -64i. So, together, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for (1 - i)^13:\n\nAngle is -13\u03c0/4.

As I noted earlier, since product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1, so product_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k) = c\u00b9\u00b3 - 1. But since (\u03c9^k - c) = -(c - \u03c9^k), then P(c) = product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - c) = (-1)^13 * product_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k) = (-1)^13 (c\u00b9\u00b3 - 1) = - (c\u00b9\u00b3 - 1).\n\nTherefore, P(c) = - (c\u00b9\u00b3 - 1). So, in our case, since we have two such products for a and b, the total product is [ - (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1) ] * [ - (b\u00b9\u00b3 - 1) ] = (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)(b\u00b9\u00b3 - 1).\n\nSo now, substituting a = 1 + i and b = 1 - i, we need to compute ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ).\n\nHmm, okay, let's compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13. Perhaps using De Moivre's theorem.\n\n1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4 radians. So 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) and argument -\u03c0/4, so 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^{13}: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the exponentials: e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i*(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * e^{i3\u03c0} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * (-1), since e^{i3\u03c0} = e^{i\u03c0} = -1.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i*(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{-i\u03c0/4} * e^{-i3\u03c0} = e^{-i\u03c0/4} * (-1).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4} * (-1) = -64 sqrt(2) [cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4)].\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4} * (-1) = -64 sqrt(2) [cos(\u03c0/4) - i sin(\u03c0/4)].\n\nCompute cos(\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2, sin(\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 + i)^13 = -64 sqrt(2) [ sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ] = -64 sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 (1 + i ) = -64 * (2)/2 (1 + i ) = -64 (1 + i).\n\nSimilarly,\n\n(1 - i)^13 = -64 sqrt(2) [ sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ] = -64 sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 (1 - i ) = -64 (1 - i).\n\nSo, both (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 are equal to -64 (1 + i) and -64 (1 - i) respectively.\n\nNow, let's compute (1 + i)^13 - 1 and (1 - i)^13 -1.\n\n(1 + i)^13 -1 = -64(1 + i) - 1 = -64 -64i - 1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 -1 = -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, the product is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i).

So, 13\u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, cos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nTherefore, A = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 i) = 64 * (-2)/2 i = -64i.\n\nSo, A = (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, B = (1 - i)^13.\n\nAgain, modulus is sqrt(2)^13 = 2^{13/2} = same as A, which is 64*sqrt(2).\n\nThe angle is 13*(-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4.

It is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1.\n\nTherefore, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(\u03b1) = \u03b1\u00b9\u00b2 + \u03b1\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + \u03b1 + 1, and similarly for \u03a6\u2081\u2083(\u03b2).\n\nBut since \u03b1 = 1 + i, I need to compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1+i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i). Then multiply them together.\n\nSo, let's compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).",

Correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) is \u221a2 e^{-i\u03c0/4}, so (1 - i)^13 is (\u221a2)^13 e^{-i13\u03c0/4} = 64\u221a2 e^{-i5\u03c0/4}. e^{-i5\u03c0/4} is cos(-5\u03c0/4) + i sin(-5\u03c0/4) = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2) + i\u221a2/2. So, 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2) = 64*(-1) + 64i = (-64 + 64i). Subtract 1 gives (-65 +64i). Correct.\n\nThen, the product (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (64^2)(i^2) = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nTherefore, the remainder is 321. So, I think that's the answer.",

Adding multiples of 2\u03c0 until in the range [0, 2\u03c0):\n\n-13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = -13\u03c0/4 + 16\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4.",

That seems correct because x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 factors into (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\n2. Then, the product becomes two separate products: [product over (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [product over (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\n3. Recognized that each product is (1 + i)^13 - 1 and (1 - i)^13 - 1 because when you take the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for all k, you get x^13 - 1.\n\n4.

Angle: 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is \u03c0/4 more than 3\u03c0, but 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0. So, 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0, so modulo 2\u03c0, it's \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, the angle is 5\u03c0/4. Therefore, (1 + i)^13 is 64 sqrt(2) [cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)].\n\ncos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, multiply by 64 sqrt(2):\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = -64\n\nSimilarly, 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 i) = -64i. So, together, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for (1 - i)^13:\n\nAngle is -13\u03c0/4. As before, angle is equivalent to 3\u03c0/4 when considering modulo 2\u03c0.\n\ncos(3\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(3\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -64, and 64 sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2 i) = 64i.

The angle becomes 13 * \u03c0/4 = (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0. But since angles are modulo 2\u03c0, 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 is \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0 = \u03c0/4 + \u03c0 = 5\u03c0/4. So, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)) = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) = 64*(-1)(1 + i) = -64(1 + i).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i). Then, (1 + i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 + i) - 1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nThen, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = ( -65 -64i ) / (i) = (-65 -64i)/i. Let me multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make it easier: (-65 -64i)(-i) / (i*(-i)) = (65i + 64i\u00b2) / 1 = 65i + 64*(-1) = 65i -64.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = -64 + 65i.\n\nSimilarly, compute (1 - i)^13. Since (1 - i) is the conjugate of (1 + i), so its magnitude is also sqrt(2), but angle is -\u03c0/4. Raising to 13th power, magnitude is 2^(13/2) same as before, 64*sqrt(2). The angle becomes 13*(-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4. Adding multiples of 2\u03c0 to bring it within [0, 2\u03c0): Let's see, -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0 + 16\u03c0)/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So, the angle is 3\u03c0/4. So, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) [ cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) ] = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i) = 64*(-1)(1 - i) = -64(1 - i).\n\nTherefore, (1 - i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nThen, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = ( -65 +64i ) / ( -i ) = ( -65 +64i ) / (-i). Multiply numerator and denominator by i: (-65 +64i)i / (-i^2) = (-65i +64i\u00b2)/1 = (-65i -64)/1 = -64 -65i.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = -64 -65i.\n\nNow, the product \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) is equal to (-64 +65i)(-64 -65i). Let me compute that. It's a product of complex conjugates, so it's equal to (-64)^2 + (65)^2. Compute that:\n\n64\u00b2 = 4096, 65\u00b2=4225. So, 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. Therefore, the original product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is equal to 8321.",

Since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i*(13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0*1)} = e^{i*(13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4)} = e^{i*(5\u03c0/4)}.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i*13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i*(5\u03c0/4)}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{i*5\u03c0/4} and (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{-i*5\u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, e^{i*5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i(sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i*5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i(sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, let's compute (1 + i)^13:\n\n64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i(sqrt(2)/2) ] = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) * (1 + i).",

Since 13 is odd, (-1)^13 = -1, so \u220f_{\u03b1_i} (\u03b1_i - c) = (-1)^{13} f(c) = -f(c).\n\nSo, \u220f_{\u03b1_i} (\u03b1_i - c) = (-1)^{13} f(c) = -f(c).\n\nTherefore, \u220f_{\u03b1_i} (\u03b1_i - (1+i)) = -f(1+i) and \u220f_{\u03b1_i} (\u03b1_i - (1-i)) = -f(1-i).\n\nSo, P = [ -f(1+i) ] * [ -f(1-i) ] = f(1+i) * f(1-i).\n\nSo, f(z) = z^13 -1, so f(1+i) = (1+i)^13 -1 and f(1-i) = (1-i)^13 -1.\n\nSo, P = [(1+i)^13 -1] * [(1-i)^13 -1].\n\nSo, now I need to compute (1+i)^13 and (1-i)^13.\n\nHmm, 1+i and 1-i are complex conjugates, and they have magnitude sqrt(2) and angles \u03c0/4 and -\u03c0/4 respectively.\n\nSo, (1+i) can be written as sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}, and (1-i) as sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1+i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1-i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, 13\u03c0/4: Let's compute 13\u03c0/4 modulo 2\u03c0. Since 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is more than 2\u03c0, so subtract 2\u03c0: 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0. So, 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{i *5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i *5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 (1 + i)).\n\nSimplify sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = 2, so:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part would be 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2 i) = 64*(-1)i = -64i.",
          "text2": "But wait, our \u03b1_k are all the 13th roots, including 1. So, for the product over all \u03b1_k of (x - \u03b1_k) is x^13 - 1.

So, maybe the product over all \u03b1_k of (c - \u03b1_k) is c^13 -1.\n\nTherefore, the product over all \u03b1_k of (\u03b1_k^2 - 2\u03b1_k + 2) is the same as the product over all \u03b1_k of (\u03b1_k^2 - 2\u03b1_k + 2). Let me write this as product (\u03b1_k^2 - 2\u03b1_k + 2) = product (\u03b1_k^2 - 2\u03b1_k + 2). Hmm, perhaps I can factor this as product ( (\u03b1_k - a)(\u03b1_k - b) ), where a and b are roots of x^2 - 2x + 2 = 0.\n\nLet me find the roots of f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. Using quadratic formula: x = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So, a = 1 + i, b = 1 - i.\n\nTherefore, product (\u03b1_k^2 - 2\u03b1_k + 2) = product (\u03b1_k - a)(\u03b1_k - b) = [product (\u03b1_k - a)] * [product (\u03b1_k - b)].\n\nBut, as I thought earlier, the product over all \u03b1_k of (x - \u03b1_k) is x^13 -1. So, product (\u03b1_k - a) is (a^13 -1), and product (\u03b1_k - b) is (b^13 -1). Therefore, the entire product is (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1).\n\nSo, substituting a = 1 + i and b = 1 - i, we get:\n\nProduct = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 )\n\nSo, this simplifies our problem to computing (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, subtracting 1 from each, multiplying them together, and then taking the result modulo 1000.\n\nNow, let's compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13. To do this, we can express (1 + i) in polar form. Let's compute the modulus and argument.\n\nThe modulus of (1 + i) is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is arctan(1/1) = \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * (cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4)) = sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) and argument -\u03c0/4, so 1 - i = sqrt(2) e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet's compute (sqrt(2))^13. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents e^{i 13\u03c0/4} and e^{-i 13\u03c0/4}. Let's note that 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 * 1 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Similarly, -13\u03c0/4 is the same as -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0 + 16\u03c0)/4 = 3\u03c0/4.",

So b^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} e^{-i 13\u03c0/4}.\n\n13\u03c0/4 is 5\u03c0/4 as before, but since it's negative, e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i 5\u03c0/4}, which is cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i*(-sqrt(2)/2) )= -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo b^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)/2 ( -1 + i ) = 64*(-1 + i).\n\nSo (b^13 - 1) = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo the numerator becomes (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nDenominator is (a - 1)(b - 1) = (i)(-i) = (-i\u00b2) = 1.\n\nSo \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(b) = 8321.\n\nSo the product is 8321.

So, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = - (a^{13} - 1).\n\nSo, applying that to our case, the first product is product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = - [ (1 + i)^{13} - 1 ].\n\nSimilarly, the second product is product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = - [ (1 - i)^{13} - 1 ].\n\nTherefore, the entire product is [ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] multiplied by [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nSimplify the signs: (-1) * (-1) = 1, so the product becomes [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nHmm, okay. So now I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, then plug them into this expression.\n\nFirst, let's compute (1 + i)^13. I know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is arctan(1/1) = \u03c0/4. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) has modulus sqrt(2), and argument -\u03c0/4. So, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet's compute (sqrt(2))^{13}. Since sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents. For (1 + i)^13, the angle is 13\u03c0/4. Let's simplify that.\n\n13\u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Because 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 3*\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But angles are periodic modulo 2\u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Similarly, 5\u03c0/4 is in the third quadrant.\n\nSimilarly, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nLet's compute that. Multiplying 64 * sqrt(2) by (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2):\n\nFirst, sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = ( - (2)/2 ) = -1.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2 ) = -i (2)/2 = -i.\n\nSo, multiplying by 64: 64 * (-1 - i) = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nCompute that: sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ) = (-1 + i).\n\nMultiply by 64: 64*(-1 + i) = -64 + 64i.\n\nSo, now we have:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i,\n\n(1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nNow, plug these into our expression:\n\n[ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ] =\n\n[ (-64 - 64i - 1 ) * (-64 + 64i - 1 ) ] =\n\n[ (-65 - 64i ) * (-65 + 64i ) ].\n\nThis is a product of the form (a - b)(a + b) where a = -65 and b = 64i.

Similarly, 1/(-i) = i.\n\nSo, each term can be rewritten:\n\nFirst term: [ ((1 + i)^{13} - 1) * (-i) ]\n\nSecond term: [ ((1 - i)^{13} - 1) * i ]\n\nSo the entire product is [ ((1 + i)^{13} - 1) * (-i) ] * [ ((1 - i)^{13} - 1) * i ].\n\nMultiply the constants: (-i) * i = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So, the constants multiply to 1. Thus, the product simplifies to [ ((1 + i)^{13} - 1) * ((1 - i)^{13} - 1) ].\n\nSo now, I need to compute ((1 + i)^{13} - 1) * ((1 - i)^{13} - 1).\n\nHmm, that's still a bit complex. Let me compute (1 + i)^{13} and (1 - i)^{13} separately.\n\nFirst, note that (1 + i) is a complex number. Its magnitude is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and its angle (argument) is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle -\u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, when we raise (1 + i) to the 13th power, using De Moivre's theorem, it becomes (sqrt(2))^13 * (cos(13\u03c0/4) + i sin(13\u03c0/4)).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 is (sqrt(2))^13 * (cos(-13\u03c0/4) + i sin(-13\u03c0/4)).\n\nBut cos is even and sin is odd, so cos(-13\u03c0/4) = cos(13\u03c0/4), and sin(-13\u03c0/4) = -sin(13\u03c0/4).\n\nSo, let's compute (sqrt(2))^13 first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ cos(13\u03c0/4) + i sin(13\u03c0/4) ]\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ cos(13\u03c0/4) - i sin(13\u03c0/4) ]\n\nNow, let's compute cos(13\u03c0/4) and sin(13\u03c0/4).\n\n13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, since 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4.",

So, e^{i13\u03c0/4} = e^{i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2).\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64\u221a2 \u00d7 (-\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2) = 64\u221a2 \u00d7 (-\u221a2/2)(1 + i). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, \u221a2 \u00d7 \u221a2 is 2. So, 64\u221a2 \u00d7 (-\u221a2/2) = 64 \u00d7 (-2/2) = 64 \u00d7 (-1) = -64. So, that's the magnitude. Then multiplied by (1 + i), so (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64\u221a2 \u00d7 (-\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2) = 64\u221a2 \u00d7 (-\u221a2/2)(1 - i). Let's compute that.\n\nAgain, \u221a2 \u00d7 \u221a2 = 2, so 64\u221a2 \u00d7 (-\u221a2/2) = 64 \u00d7 (-2/2) = -64. Then multiplied by (1 - i), so (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i).\n\nSo, now the product becomes [(-64(1 + i) - 1)] \u00d7 [(-64(1 - i) - 1)].",

Let me verify that.\n\nYes, since \u03c9^k for k=0 to 12 are the 13th roots of unity, so their product is x^{13} - 1 = product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k). So, product_{k=1}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = (x^{13} - 1)/(x - 1).\n\nSo, in our case, for x = (1 + i), the product from k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) is equal to ((1 + i)^{13} - 1)/( (1 + i) - 1 ).

Let me compute (1 + i)^{13} and (1 - i)^{13} separately.\n\nFirst, note that (1 + i) is a complex number. Its magnitude is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and its angle (argument) is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle -\u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, when we raise (1 + i) to the 13th power, using De Moivre's theorem, it becomes (sqrt(2))^13 * (cos(13\u03c0/4) + i sin(13\u03c0/4)).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 is (sqrt(2))^13 * (cos(-13\u03c0/4) + i sin(-13\u03c0/4)).\n\nBut cos is even and sin is odd, so cos(-13\u03c0/4) = cos(13\u03c0/4), and sin(-13\u03c0/4) = -sin(13\u03c0/4).\n\nSo, let's compute (sqrt(2))^13 first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ cos(13\u03c0/4) + i sin(13\u03c0/4) ]\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ cos(13\u03c0/4) - i sin(13\u03c0/4) ]\n\nNow, let's compute cos(13\u03c0/4) and sin(13\u03c0/4).\n\n13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, since 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4.",

Now, I just need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, then plug them into this expression.\n\nFirst, let's compute (1 + i)^13. I know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is \u221a(1^2 + 1^2) = \u221a2. The argument is arctangent(1/1) = \u03c0/4. So, 1 + i = \u221a2 e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (\u221a2)^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) is the conjugate of (1 + i), so its modulus is also \u221a2, and its argument is -\u03c0/4. So, (1 - i)^13 = (\u221a2)^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (\u221a2)^13.

Let me compute 13 * \u03c0/4 modulo 2\u03c0, since angles are periodic with 2\u03c0.\n\n13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0. But 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0, because 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0. So, 13\u03c0/4 is \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 has an angle of -13\u03c0/4. Let's compute that modulo 2\u03c0. -13\u03c0/4 can be converted by adding multiples of 2\u03c0 until it's positive. 2\u03c0 is 8\u03c0/4, so adding 3*(8\u03c0/4)=24\u03c0/4 gives us (-13\u03c0/4 + 24\u03c0/4) = 11\u03c0/4.",

But in our case, it's product (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 product (a - \u03c9^k) = - product (a - \u03c9^k) = - (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1). Because 13 is odd, right? So each term (\u03c9^k - a) = - (a - \u03c9^k), so the product would be (-1)^13 times product (a - \u03c9^k) = - (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1).\n\nSo, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = - (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1).

So the product is [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nSo now, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, subtract 1 from each, multiply them, and then find the result modulo 1000.\n\nFirst, let me compute (1 + i)^13. Remember that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4 radians. So 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^{13} first. Since sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, raising it to 13 gives 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} and e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}. Since 13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is the same as \u03c0/4 in the next revolution because 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 in terms of angle direction.",

So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute sqrt(2)^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSimilarly, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}. Let's compute 13\u03c0/4 modulo 2\u03c0. 13/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. So, 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 is the same as \u03c0/4 since 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0 (because 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0).",

Similarly, product over k=0 to12 (\u03c9^k - b) = - (b^13 -1)/(b -1).\n\nTherefore, the total product is [ - (a^13 -1)/(a -1) ] * [ - (b^13 -1)/(b -1) ] = [ (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1) ] / [ (a -1)(b -1) ].\n\nSo, the product becomes ( (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1) ) divided by ( (a -1)(b -1) ).\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute a = 1 + i and b = 1 - i.\n\nCompute a -1 = i and b -1 = -i. So, (a -1)(b -1) = (i)(-i) = -i\u00b2 = -(-1) = 1.\n\nSo, the denominator is 1. That's convenient.\n\nSo, the product simplifies to (a^13 - 1)(b^13 -1).\n\nNow, let's compute (a^13 -1) and (b^13 -1).\n\nBut a = 1 + i. Let's compute a^13.\n\nFirst, let's compute a in polar form. 1 + i has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4.

So, in this case, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is the product from k=1 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k). Therefore, the product over x of (x - a) is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a).\n\nSo, going back, the product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product over x of (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). Which is equal to \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i). Because for each x, it's (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)), so the product over all x is [product (x - (1 + i))] * [product (x - (1 - i))], which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).\n\nSo now, I need to compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i). Let me recall that \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. So, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(x - 1).\n\nThus, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) = (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(a - 1). Therefore, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = [(1 + i)^13 - 1]/[(1 + i) - 1] = [(1 + i)^13 - 1]/(i). Similarly, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = [(1 - i)^13 - 1]/[(1 - i) - 1] = [(1 - i)^13 - 1]/(-i).\n\nSo, let me compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) separately.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13. Let's compute powers of (1 + i). I know that (1 + i) has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4, so when raised to the 13th power, the magnitude becomes (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2). The angle becomes 13 * \u03c0/4 = (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0. But since angles are modulo 2\u03c0, 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 is \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0 = \u03c0/4 + \u03c0 = 5\u03c0/4. So, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)) = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) = 64*(-1)(1 + i) = -64(1 + i).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i). Then, (1 + i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 + i) - 1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nThen, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = ( -65 -64i ) / (i) = (-65 -64i)/i. Let me multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make it easier: (-65 -64i)(-i) / (i*(-i)) = (65i + 64i\u00b2) / 1 = 65i + 64*(-1) = 65i -64.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = -64 + 65i.\n\nSimilarly, compute (1 - i)^13. Since (1 - i) is the conjugate of (1 + i), so its magnitude is also sqrt(2), but angle is -\u03c0/4. Raising to 13th power, magnitude is 2^(13/2) same as before, 64*sqrt(2). The angle becomes 13*(-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4. Adding multiples of 2\u03c0 to bring it within [0, 2\u03c0): Let's see, -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0 + 16\u03c0)/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So, the angle is 3\u03c0/4. So, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) [ cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) ] = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i) = 64*(-1)(1 - i) = -64(1 - i).\n\nTherefore, (1 - i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nThen, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = ( -65 +64i ) / ( -i ) = ( -65 +64i ) / (-i). Multiply numerator and denominator by i: (-65 +64i)i / (-i^2) = (-65i +64i\u00b2)/1 = (-65i -64)/1 = -64 -65i.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = -64 -65i.\n\nNow, the product \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) is equal to (-64 +65i)(-64 -65i). Let me compute that. It's a product of complex conjugates, so it's equal to (-64)^2 + (65)^2. Compute that:\n\n64\u00b2 = 4096, 65\u00b2=4225. So, 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321.

Let's compute 13 * \u03c0/4 modulo 2\u03c0.\n\n13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0. So, angle is \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nCompute this: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = same as above, so also -64i.",

So, 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0, so modulo 2\u03c0, it's \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, the angle is 5\u03c0/4. Therefore, (1 + i)^13 is 64 sqrt(2) [cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)].\n\ncos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, multiply by 64 sqrt(2):\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = -64\n\nSimilarly, 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 i) = -64i.

As I noted earlier, since product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1, so product_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k) = c\u00b9\u00b3 - 1. But since (\u03c9^k - c) = -(c - \u03c9^k), then P(c) = product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - c) = (-1)^13 * product_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k) = (-1)^13 (c\u00b9\u00b3 - 1) = - (c\u00b9\u00b3 - 1).\n\nTherefore, P(c) = - (c\u00b9\u00b3 - 1). So, in our case, since we have two such products for a and b, the total product is [ - (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1) ] * [ - (b\u00b9\u00b3 - 1) ] = (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)(b\u00b9\u00b3 - 1).\n\nSo now, substituting a = 1 + i and b = 1 - i, we need to compute ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ).\n\nHmm, okay, let's compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13. Perhaps using De Moivre's theorem.\n\n1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4 radians. So 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) and argument -\u03c0/4, so 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^{13}: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the exponentials: e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i*(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * e^{i3\u03c0} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * (-1), since e^{i3\u03c0} = e^{i\u03c0} = -1.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i*(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{-i\u03c0/4} * e^{-i3\u03c0} = e^{-i\u03c0/4} * (-1).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4} * (-1) = -64 sqrt(2) [cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4)].\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4} * (-1) = -64 sqrt(2) [cos(\u03c0/4) - i sin(\u03c0/4)].\n\nCompute cos(\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2, sin(\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 + i)^13 = -64 sqrt(2) [ sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ] = -64 sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 (1 + i ) = -64 * (2)/2 (1 + i ) = -64 (1 + i).\n\nSimilarly,\n\n(1 - i)^13 = -64 sqrt(2) [ sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ] = -64 sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 (1 - i ) = -64 (1 - i).\n\nSo, both (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 are equal to -64 (1 + i) and -64 (1 - i) respectively.\n\nNow, let's compute (1 + i)^13 - 1 and (1 - i)^13 -1.\n\n(1 + i)^13 -1 = -64(1 + i) - 1 = -64 -64i - 1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 -1 = -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, the product is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i).

So, 13\u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, cos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nTherefore, A = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 i) = 64 * (-2)/2 i = -64i.\n\nSo, A = (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, B = (1 - i)^13.\n\nAgain, modulus is sqrt(2)^13 = 2^{13/2} = same as A, which is 64*sqrt(2).\n\nThe angle is 13*(-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4.

So, that's correct.\n\nSo, [ (1 + i)^{13} -1 ] * [ (1 - i)^{13} -1 ].\n\nComputed (1 + i)^13:\n\n1 + i = sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}, so to the 13th power is (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i13\u03c0/4}.\n\n(sqrt(2))^13 is 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\n13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is equivalent to \u03c0/4 beyond 3\u03c0, but in terms of standard angles, subtracting 2\u03c0 gives 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nMultiply by 64 sqrt(2): 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-1) = -64, same for the imaginary part: 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 i) = -64 i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i, correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13: same modulus, angle is -\u03c0/4, so 13*(-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4. Adding multiples of 2\u03c0 until in the range [0, 2\u03c0):\n\n-13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = -13\u03c0/4 + 16\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4.",

That seems correct because x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 factors into (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\n2. Then, the product becomes two separate products: [product over (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [product over (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\n3. Recognized that each product is (1 + i)^13 - 1 and (1 - i)^13 - 1 because when you take the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for all k, you get x^13 - 1.\n\n4. Calculated (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 correctly? Let me check:\n\n(1 + i) in polar form: magnitude sqrt(2), angle \u03c0/4. Raising to 13th power: (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 sqrt(2). Angle: 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is \u03c0/4 more than 3\u03c0, but 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0. So, 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0, so modulo 2\u03c0, it's \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, the angle is 5\u03c0/4. Therefore, (1 + i)^13 is 64 sqrt(2) [cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)].\n\ncos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, multiply by 64 sqrt(2):\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = -64\n\nSimilarly, 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 i) = -64i. So, together, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for (1 - i)^13:\n\nAngle is -13\u03c0/4. As before, angle is equivalent to 3\u03c0/4 when considering modulo 2\u03c0.\n\ncos(3\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(3\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -64, and 64 sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2 i) = 64i. So, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.

So, if g(z) is monic, then Res(f, g) = \u220f_{i=1}^{n} f(\u03b1_i), where n is the degree of g.

Since g(z) is degree 12, the resultant would be \u220f_{i=1}^{12} f(\u03b1_i). So Res(f, g) = \u220f_{i=1}^{12} (\u03b1_i\u00b2 - 2\u03b1_i + 2).",

So yes, in this case, the product we want is the resultant of z^2 - 2z +2 and z^13 -1.\n\nI'm not too familiar with resultants, but maybe I can think of it as follows: If I consider the polynomial z^13 -1, which splits into linear factors as (z -1)(z - \u03c9)(z - \u03c9^2)...(z - \u03c9^12).

Therefore, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03b1 - \u03c9^k) = \u03b1^13 - 1, and similarly product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03b2 - \u03c9^k) = \u03b2^13 -1.\n\nTherefore, the product we're looking for is (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1).\n\nSo, now, I just need to compute (\u03b1^13 - 1)(\u03b2^13 -1), where \u03b1 = 1 + i and \u03b2 = 1 - i.\n\nBut let's compute \u03b1^13 and \u03b2^13.\n\nFirst, note that \u03b1 = 1 + i. Let's compute its modulus and argument.\n\n|\u03b1| = sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2).\n\nThe argument \u03b8 = arctan(1/1) = \u03c0/4.\n\nSo, \u03b1 can be written in polar form as sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, \u03b2 = 1 - i, which has modulus sqrt(2) and argument -\u03c0/4, so \u03b2 = sqrt(2) e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, \u03b1^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i 13 \u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSimilarly, 13 \u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is equivalent to \u03c0/4 (since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0). So e^{i 13 \u03c0/4} = e^{i \u03c0/4} = cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nTherefore, \u03b1^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 (1 + i) = 64 * (2)/2 (1 + i) = 64 (1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, \u03b2^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{-i 13 \u03c0/4} = 64 sqrt(2) e^{-i \u03c0/4} = 64 sqrt(2) [cos(-\u03c0/4) + i sin(-\u03c0/4)] = 64 sqrt(2) [sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2] = 64 (1 - i).\n\nSo, \u03b1^13 = 64(1 + i), \u03b2^13 = 64(1 - i).\n\nTherefore, (\u03b1^13 - 1) = 64(1 + i) - 1 = (64 - 1) + 64i = 63 + 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (\u03b2^13 -1) = 64(1 - i) -1 = (64 -1) -64i = 63 -64i.\n\nSo, the product is (63 + 64i)(63 -64i) = 63^2 + (64)^2.\n\nCompute 63^2: 63*63 = 3969.\n\nCompute 64^2: 4096.\n\nSo, total product is 3969 + 4096 = 8065.",

The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is \u03c0/4 radians because it's in the first quadrant.\n\nSo, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, raising to the 13th power:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^{13}. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the exponential terms. 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is the same as \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0. Since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i*(13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0*1)} = e^{i*(13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4)} = e^{i*(5\u03c0/4)}.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i*13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i*(5\u03c0/4)}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{i*5\u03c0/4} and (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{-i*5\u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, e^{i*5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i(sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i*5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i(sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, let's compute (1 + i)^13:\n\n64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i(sqrt(2)/2) ] = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) * (1 + i).",

So, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = - (a^{13} - 1).\n\nSo, applying that to our case, the first product is product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = - [ (1 + i)^{13} - 1 ].\n\nSimilarly, the second product is product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = - [ (1 - i)^{13} - 1 ].\n\nTherefore, the entire product is [ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] multiplied by [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nSimplify the signs: (-1) * (-1) = 1, so the product becomes [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nHmm, okay. So now I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, then plug them into this expression.\n\nFirst, let's compute (1 + i)^13. I know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is arctan(1/1) = \u03c0/4. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) has modulus sqrt(2), and argument -\u03c0/4. So, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet's compute (sqrt(2))^{13}. Since sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents. For (1 + i)^13, the angle is 13\u03c0/4. Let's simplify that.\n\n13\u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Because 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 3*\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But angles are periodic modulo 2\u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Similarly, 5\u03c0/4 is in the third quadrant.\n\nSimilarly, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nLet's compute that. Multiplying 64 * sqrt(2) by (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2):\n\nFirst, sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = ( - (2)/2 ) = -1.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2 ) = -i (2)/2 = -i.\n\nSo, multiplying by 64: 64 * (-1 - i) = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nCompute that: sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ) = (-1 + i).\n\nMultiply by 64: 64*(-1 + i) = -64 + 64i.\n\nSo, now we have:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i,\n\n(1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nNow, plug these into our expression:\n\n[ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ] =\n\n[ (-64 - 64i - 1 ) * (-64 + 64i - 1 ) ] =\n\n[ (-65 - 64i ) * (-65 + 64i ) ].\n\nThis is a product of the form (a - b)(a + b) where a = -65 and b = 64i.

Let's compute 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2) = 64 * ( (-\u221a2 * \u221a2)/2 ) = 64*(-2/2) = 64*(-1) = -64. Similarly, for the imaginary part: 64\u221a2 * (-i\u221a2/2) = 64*(-i*(2)/2) = 64*(-i) = -64i. So, overall, (1 + i)^13 = (-64 -64i). Subtract 1, gives (-65 -64i). Correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) is \u221a2 e^{-i\u03c0/4}, so (1 - i)^13 is (\u221a2)^13 e^{-i13\u03c0/4} = 64\u221a2 e^{-i5\u03c0/4}. e^{-i5\u03c0/4} is cos(-5\u03c0/4) + i sin(-5\u03c0/4) = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2) + i\u221a2/2. So, 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2) = 64*(-1) + 64i = (-64 + 64i). Subtract 1 gives (-65 +64i). Correct.\n\nThen, the product (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (64^2)(i^2) = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nTherefore, the remainder is 321. So, I think that's the answer.",

Its magnitude is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and its angle (argument) is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle -\u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, when we raise (1 + i) to the 13th power, using De Moivre's theorem, it becomes (sqrt(2))^13 * (cos(13\u03c0/4) + i sin(13\u03c0/4)).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 is (sqrt(2))^13 * (cos(-13\u03c0/4) + i sin(-13\u03c0/4)).\n\nBut cos is even and sin is odd, so cos(-13\u03c0/4) = cos(13\u03c0/4), and sin(-13\u03c0/4) = -sin(13\u03c0/4).\n\nSo, let's compute (sqrt(2))^13 first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ cos(13\u03c0/4) + i sin(13\u03c0/4) ]\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ cos(13\u03c0/4) - i sin(13\u03c0/4) ]\n\nNow, let's compute cos(13\u03c0/4) and sin(13\u03c0/4).\n\n13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, since 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4.",

So each term (\u03c9^k - a) = - (a - \u03c9^k), so the product would be (-1)^13 times product (a - \u03c9^k) = - (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1).\n\nSo, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = - (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1).

          "text2": "Wait, but in our case, x is (1 + i) and (1 - i). So, the first product is (1 + i)^13 - 1, and the second is (1 - i)^13 - 1. So, the entire product is [(1 + i)^13 - 1] \u00d7 [(1 - i)^13 - 1].\n\nSo now, we can compute each part separately. Let's compute (1 + i)^13 first. I know that 1 + i can be represented in polar form. Since 1 + i has magnitude \u221a2 and angle \u03c0/4. So, (1 + i) = \u221a2 e^{i\u03c0/4}. Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = (\u221a2)^13 e^{i13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) is \u221a2 e^{-i\u03c0/4}, so (1 - i)^13 = (\u221a2)^13 e^{-i13\u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (\u221a2)^13. Since \u221a2 is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 \u00d7 2^{1/2} = 64 \u00d7 \u221a2 = 64\u221a2.\n\nNow, let's compute the angles. 13\u03c0/4 is the same as 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 \u00d7 1 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i13\u03c0/4} = e^{i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2).\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64\u221a2 \u00d7 (-\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2) = 64\u221a2 \u00d7 (-\u221a2/2)(1 + i). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, \u221a2 \u00d7 \u221a2 is 2. So, 64\u221a2 \u00d7 (-\u221a2/2) = 64 \u00d7 (-2/2) = 64 \u00d7 (-1) = -64. So, that's the magnitude. Then multiplied by (1 + i), so (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64\u221a2 \u00d7 (-\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2) = 64\u221a2 \u00d7 (-\u221a2/2)(1 - i). Let's compute that.\n\nAgain, \u221a2 \u00d7 \u221a2 = 2, so 64\u221a2 \u00d7 (-\u221a2/2) = 64 \u00d7 (-2/2) = -64. Then multiplied by (1 - i), so (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i).\n\nSo, now the product becomes [(-64(1 + i) - 1)] \u00d7 [(-64(1 - i) - 1)].",

Let me verify that.\n\nYes, since \u03c9^k for k=0 to 12 are the 13th roots of unity, so their product is x^{13} - 1 = product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k).

          "text1": "Wait, no. Because \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 - 1, so if I take x = a, it's a^13 - 1. But in our case, it's \u03c9^k - a, which is (-1)^13 (a - \u03c9^k) since 13 is odd. So, \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = - (a^13 - 1) = 1 - a^13.\n\nSo, that's a useful identity. Therefore, \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = 1 - a^13.\n\nSo, applying this to our problem, the product becomes:\n\n[1 - (1 + i)^13] * [1 - (1 - i)^13]\n\nSo, the entire product is equal to [1 - (1 + i)^13] * [1 - (1 - i)^13].\n\nThat's a significant simplification. Now, I just need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, then plug them into this expression.\n\nFirst, let's compute (1 + i)^13. I know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is \u221a(1^2 + 1^2) = \u221a2. The argument is arctangent(1/1) = \u03c0/4. So, 1 + i = \u221a2 e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (\u221a2)^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) is the conjugate of (1 + i), so its modulus is also \u221a2, and its argument is -\u03c0/4. So, (1 - i)^13 = (\u221a2)^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (\u221a2)^13. Since \u221a2 is 2^{1/2}, so (\u221a2)^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * \u221a2.\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents. For (1 + i)^13, the angle is 13 * \u03c0/4. Let me compute 13 * \u03c0/4 modulo 2\u03c0, since angles are periodic with 2\u03c0.\n\n13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0. But 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0, because 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0. So, 13\u03c0/4 is \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 has an angle of -13\u03c0/4. Let's compute that modulo 2\u03c0. -13\u03c0/4 can be converted by adding multiples of 2\u03c0 until it's positive. 2\u03c0 is 8\u03c0/4, so adding 3*(8\u03c0/4)=24\u03c0/4 gives us (-13\u03c0/4 + 24\u03c0/4) = 11\u03c0/4.",

But in our case, it's product (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 product (a - \u03c9^k) = - product (a - \u03c9^k) = - (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1). Because 13 is odd, right? So each term (\u03c9^k - a) = - (a - \u03c9^k), so the product would be (-1)^13 times product (a - \u03c9^k) = - (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1).\n\nSo, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = - (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1). Therefore, in our case, the two products are:\n\nproduct_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = - [(1 + i)^13 - 1]\nproduct_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = - [(1 - i)^13 - 1]\n\nSo the entire product is [ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nSimplifying the negatives: (-1) * (-1) = 1. So the product is [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nSo now, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, subtract 1 from each, multiply them, and then find the result modulo 1000.\n\nFirst, let me compute (1 + i)^13. Remember that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4 radians. So 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^{13} first. Since sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, raising it to 13 gives 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} and e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}. Since 13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is the same as \u03c0/4 in the next revolution because 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 in terms of angle direction.",

So, the entire product is the product over k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nThat is, the product can be written as [product over k=0 to12 (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] multiplied by [product over k=0 to12 (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\nEach of these products is equal to - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) and similarly for (1 - i). Let me write that down.\n\nSo, let me denote a = 1 + i and b = 1 - i.\n\nThen, product over k=0 to12 (\u03c9^k - a) = - (a^13 - 1)/(a - 1). Similarly, product over k=0 to12 (\u03c9^k - b) = - (b^13 -1)/(b -1).\n\nTherefore, the total product is [ - (a^13 -1)/(a -1) ] * [ - (b^13 -1)/(b -1) ] = [ (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1) ] / [ (a -1)(b -1) ].\n\nSo, the product becomes ( (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1) ) divided by ( (a -1)(b -1) ).\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute a = 1 + i and b = 1 - i.\n\nCompute a -1 = i and b -1 = -i. So, (a -1)(b -1) = (i)(-i) = -i\u00b2 = -(-1) = 1.\n\nSo, the denominator is 1. That's convenient.\n\nSo, the product simplifies to (a^13 - 1)(b^13 -1).\n\nNow, let's compute (a^13 -1) and (b^13 -1).\n\nBut a = 1 + i. Let's compute a^13.\n\nFirst, let's compute a in polar form. 1 + i has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4. So, a = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, a^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly for b = 1 - i, which is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}. So, b^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, compute the exponents e^{i *13\u03c0/4} and e^{-i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\n13\u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Since 13/4 = 3 + 1/4, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But angles are periodic modulo 2\u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0*(1) = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{i *5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i *5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, a^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) ) ].\n\nCompute that: 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (- (2)/2 ) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the other term is 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) ) = same as above, so a^13 = -64(1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, compute b^13: 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i) ) ].\n\nSame computation: 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -64, so b^13 = -64(1 - i).\n\nTherefore, a^13 -1 = -64(1 + i) -1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, b^13 -1 = -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, the product (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1) = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i). That looks like the product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's | -65 -64i |\u00b2.\n\nWhich is (-65)^2 + (64)^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n(-65)^2 = 4225\n\n64^2 = 4096\n\nSo total is 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nTherefore, the product is 8321.",

So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the exponents:\n\ne^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i*(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * e^{i3\u03c0} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * (-1), because e^{i\u03c0} = -1, so e^{i3\u03c0} = (e^{i\u03c0})^3 = (-1)^3 = -1.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i*(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{-i\u03c0/4} * e^{-i3\u03c0} = e^{-i\u03c0/4} * (-1).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-1) * e^{i\u03c0/4} = -64 sqrt(2) * (cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4)) = -64 sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = -64 sqrt(2) * ( (1 + i)/sqrt(2) ) = -64 (1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-1) * e^{-i\u03c0/4} = -64 sqrt(2) * (cos(-\u03c0/4) + i sin(-\u03c0/4)) = -64 sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = -64 sqrt(2) * ( (1 - i)/sqrt(2) ) = -64 (1 - i).\n\nSo, now, (1 + i)^13 = -64 (1 + i), and (1 - i)^13 = -64 (1 - i).\n\nSo, substituting back into the expression:\n\n[ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / i ] = [ (-64 (1 + i) - 1 ) / i ] = [ -64(1 + i) - 1 ] / i.\n\nSimilarly, [ ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / (-i) ] = [ (-64 (1 - i) - 1 ) / (-i) ] = [ -64(1 - i) - 1 ] / (-i).\n\nLet me compute each numerator separately:\n\nFirst numerator: -64(1 + i) -1 = -64 -64i - 1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSecond numerator: -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, the first fraction is (-65 -64i)/i, and the second is (-65 +64i)/(-i).\n\nLet me simplify each of these complex fractions.\n\nStarting with (-65 -64i)/i. To simplify, multiply numerator and denominator by -i (since 1/i = -i):\n\n(-65 -64i)/i * (-i/-i) = [ (-65 -64i)(-i) ] / (i * -i) = [ 65i +64i^2 ] / (1) because i*(-i) = -i^2 = 1.\n\nSince i^2 = -1, 64i^2 = -64. So, numerator becomes 65i -64.\n\nSo, (-65 -64i)/i = 65i -64 = (-64 +65i).\n\nSimilarly, compute (-65 +64i)/(-i). Multiply numerator and denominator by i:\n\n[ (-65 +64i) * i ] / ( (-i)*i ) = [ -65i +64i^2 ] / (1) since (-i)*i = -i^2 = 1.\n\nAgain, i^2 = -1, so 64i^2 = -64.

So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2), and argument -\u03c0/4, so 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute [sqrt(2)]^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so [2^{1/2}]^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2). So, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4} and e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSince 13 * \u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, because 13 divided by 4 is 3 with remainder 1, so 3*2\u03c0 = 6\u03c0 is more than 13\u03c0/4, but wait, wait, 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, because 3\u03c0 is 12\u03c0/4, so adding \u03c0/4 gives 13\u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is more than \u03c0, so we can subtract multiples of 2\u03c0 to get the angle within 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\nCompute 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i * 5\u03c0/4}.",

As I noted earlier, since product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1, so product_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k) = c\u00b9\u00b3 - 1. But since (\u03c9^k - c) = -(c - \u03c9^k), then P(c) = product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - c) = (-1)^13 * product_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k) = (-1)^13 (c\u00b9\u00b3 - 1) = - (c\u00b9\u00b3 - 1).\n\nTherefore, P(c) = - (c\u00b9\u00b3 - 1). So, in our case, since we have two such products for a and b, the total product is [ - (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1) ] * [ - (b\u00b9\u00b3 - 1) ] = (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)(b\u00b9\u00b3 - 1).\n\nSo now, substituting a = 1 + i and b = 1 - i, we need to compute ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ).\n\nHmm, okay, let's compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13. Perhaps using De Moivre's theorem.\n\n1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4 radians.

So, 13\u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, cos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nTherefore, A = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 i) = 64 * (-2)/2 i = -64i.\n\nSo, A = (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, B = (1 - i)^13.\n\nAgain, modulus is sqrt(2)^13 = 2^{13/2} = same as A, which is 64*sqrt(2).\n\nThe angle is 13*(-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4.

Subtracting 2\u03c0 (which is 8\u03c0/4) gives 5\u03c0/4. So, angle is 5\u03c0/4. So, cos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (-sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nSo, now let's compute (sqrt(2))^13. sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (-sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nSimplify this:\n\nFirst, multiply sqrt(2) with the terms inside the brackets.\n\nsqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = (-2)/2 = -1.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -1.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * [ -1 - i ].\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nSimplify:\n\nsqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -1.\n\nsqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2) = 1.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * [ -1 + i ].\n\nSo, now, (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i), and (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i).",

So, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = - (a^{13} - 1).\n\nSo, applying that to our case, the first product is product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = - [ (1 + i)^{13} - 1 ].\n\nSimilarly, the second product is product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = - [ (1 - i)^{13} - 1 ].\n\nTherefore, the entire product is [ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] multiplied by [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nSimplify the signs: (-1) * (-1) = 1, so the product becomes [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nHmm, okay. So now I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, then plug them into this expression.\n\nFirst, let's compute (1 + i)^13. I know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is arctan(1/1) = \u03c0/4. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) has modulus sqrt(2), and argument -\u03c0/4. So, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet's compute (sqrt(2))^{13}. Since sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents. For (1 + i)^13, the angle is 13\u03c0/4. Let's simplify that.\n\n13\u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Because 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 3*\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But angles are periodic modulo 2\u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Similarly, 5\u03c0/4 is in the third quadrant.\n\nSimilarly, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nLet's compute that. Multiplying 64 * sqrt(2) by (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2):\n\nFirst, sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = ( - (2)/2 ) = -1.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2 ) = -i (2)/2 = -i.\n\nSo, multiplying by 64: 64 * (-1 - i) = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nCompute that: sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ) = (-1 + i).\n\nMultiply by 64: 64*(-1 + i) = -64 + 64i.\n\nSo, now we have:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i,\n\n(1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nNow, plug these into our expression:\n\n[ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ] =\n\n[ (-64 - 64i - 1 ) * (-64 + 64i - 1 ) ] =\n\n[ (-65 - 64i ) * (-65 + 64i ) ].\n\nThis is a product of the form (a - b)(a + b) where a = -65 and b = 64i.

Its magnitude is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and its angle (argument) is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle -\u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, when we raise (1 + i) to the 13th power, using De Moivre's theorem, it becomes (sqrt(2))^13 * (cos(13\u03c0/4) + i sin(13\u03c0/4)).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 is (sqrt(2))^13 * (cos(-13\u03c0/4) + i sin(-13\u03c0/4)).\n\nBut cos is even and sin is odd, so cos(-13\u03c0/4) = cos(13\u03c0/4), and sin(-13\u03c0/4) = -sin(13\u03c0/4).\n\nSo, let's compute (sqrt(2))^13 first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ cos(13\u03c0/4) + i sin(13\u03c0/4) ]\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ cos(13\u03c0/4) - i sin(13\u03c0/4) ]\n\nNow, let's compute cos(13\u03c0/4) and sin(13\u03c0/4).\n\n13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, since 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4.",

Its magnitude is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and its angle (argument) is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle -\u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, when we raise (1 + i) to the 13th power, using De Moivre's theorem, it becomes (sqrt(2))^13 * (cos(13\u03c0/4) + i sin(13\u03c0/4)).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 is (sqrt(2))^13 * (cos(-13\u03c0/4) + i sin(-13\u03c0/4)).\n\nBut cos is even and sin is odd, so cos(-13\u03c0/4) = cos(13\u03c0/4), and sin(-13\u03c0/4) = -sin(13\u03c0/4).\n\nSo, let's compute (sqrt(2))^13 first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ cos(13\u03c0/4) + i sin(13\u03c0/4) ]\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ cos(13\u03c0/4) - i sin(13\u03c0/4) ]\n\nNow, let's compute cos(13\u03c0/4) and sin(13\u03c0/4).\n\n13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, since 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4.",

Now, I just need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, then plug them into this expression.\n\nFirst, let's compute (1 + i)^13. I know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is \u221a(1^2 + 1^2) = \u221a2. The argument is arctangent(1/1) = \u03c0/4. So, 1 + i = \u221a2 e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (\u221a2)^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) is the conjugate of (1 + i), so its modulus is also \u221a2, and its argument is -\u03c0/4. So, (1 - i)^13 = (\u221a2)^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (\u221a2)^13. Since \u221a2 is 2^{1/2}, so (\u221a2)^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * \u221a2.\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents. For (1 + i)^13, the angle is 13 * \u03c0/4. Let me compute 13 * \u03c0/4 modulo 2\u03c0, since angles are periodic with 2\u03c0.\n\n13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0. But 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0, because 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0. So, 13\u03c0/4 is \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 has an angle of -13\u03c0/4. Let's compute that modulo 2\u03c0. -13\u03c0/4 can be converted by adding multiples of 2\u03c0 until it's positive. 2\u03c0 is 8\u03c0/4, so adding 3*(8\u03c0/4)=24\u03c0/4 gives us (-13\u03c0/4 + 24\u03c0/4) = 11\u03c0/4.",

Since sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, raising it to 13 gives 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} and e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}.

So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2), and argument -\u03c0/4, so 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute [sqrt(2)]^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so [2^{1/2}]^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2). So, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4} and e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSince 13 * \u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, because 13 divided by 4 is 3 with remainder 1, so 3*2\u03c0 = 6\u03c0 is more than 13\u03c0/4, but wait, wait, 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, because 3\u03c0 is 12\u03c0/4, so adding \u03c0/4 gives 13\u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is more than \u03c0, so we can subtract multiples of 2\u03c0 to get the angle within 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\nCompute 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i * 5\u03c0/4}.",

Recognized that each product is (1 + i)^13 - 1 and (1 - i)^13 - 1 because when you take the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for all k, you get x^13 - 1.\n\n4. Calculated (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 correctly? Let me check:\n\n(1 + i) in polar form: magnitude sqrt(2), angle \u03c0/4. Raising to 13th power: (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 sqrt(2). Angle: 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is \u03c0/4 more than 3\u03c0, but 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0. So, 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0, so modulo 2\u03c0, it's \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, the angle is 5\u03c0/4. Therefore, (1 + i)^13 is 64 sqrt(2) [cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)].\n\ncos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, multiply by 64 sqrt(2):\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = -64\n\nSimilarly, 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 i) = -64i. So, together, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for (1 - i)^13:\n\nAngle is -13\u03c0/4. As before, angle is equivalent to 3\u03c0/4 when considering modulo 2\u03c0.\n\ncos(3\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(3\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -64, and 64 sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2 i) = 64i. So, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i. Correct.\n\nThen, subtracting 1 from each:\n\n(1 + i)^13 - 1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i\n\n(1 - i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i\n\nMultiplying these two: (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 +4096= 8321.

Therefore, product (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^{13} (a^13 -1) = - (a^13 -1).\n\nSo, for a = 1 + i, product (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ), which is correct.",

So, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = - (a^{13} - 1).\n\nSo, applying that to our case, the first product is product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = - [ (1 + i)^{13} - 1 ].\n\nSimilarly, the second product is product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = - [ (1 - i)^{13} - 1 ].\n\nTherefore, the entire product is [ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] multiplied by [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nSimplify the signs: (-1) * (-1) = 1, so the product becomes [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nHmm, okay. So now I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, then plug them into this expression.\n\nFirst, let's compute (1 + i)^13. I know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is arctan(1/1) = \u03c0/4. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) has modulus sqrt(2), and argument -\u03c0/4. So, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet's compute (sqrt(2))^{13}. Since sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents. For (1 + i)^13, the angle is 13\u03c0/4. Let's simplify that.\n\n13\u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Because 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 3*\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But angles are periodic modulo 2\u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Similarly, 5\u03c0/4 is in the third quadrant.\n\nSimilarly, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nLet's compute that. Multiplying 64 * sqrt(2) by (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2):\n\nFirst, sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = ( - (2)/2 ) = -1.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2 ) = -i (2)/2 = -i.\n\nSo, multiplying by 64: 64 * (-1 - i) = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nCompute that: sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ) = (-1 + i).\n\nMultiply by 64: 64*(-1 + i) = -64 + 64i.\n\nSo, now we have:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i,\n\n(1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nNow, plug these into our expression:\n\n[ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ] =\n\n[ (-64 - 64i - 1 ) * (-64 + 64i - 1 ) ] =\n\n[ (-65 - 64i ) * (-65 + 64i ) ].\n\nThis is a product of the form (a - b)(a + b) where a = -65 and b = 64i.

Each product is of the form product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = - (a^13 -1).\n\n7. So, product (\u03c9^k - (1+i)) = - [(1+i)^13 -1], and similarly for (1-i).\n\n8.

Used the result that product_{x: x^n=1} (x - a) = (-1)^n (a^n - 1).\n\n8. So, for a = 1 + i and n=13, product_{x} (x - (1 + i)) = (-1)^13 [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] = - [ (1 + i)^13 -1 ].\n\n9.

Similarly, -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 (which is 16\u03c0/4) = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{i *5\u03c0/4} and e^{-i *13\u03c0/4}=e^{i *3\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, let's write that:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{i *5\u03c0/4} = 64*sqrt(2) [cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)].\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{-i *13\u03c0/4} = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{i *3\u03c0/4} = 64*sqrt(2)[cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4)].\n\nLet's compute these trigonometric values:\n\ncos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\ncos(3\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(3\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, plugging in:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (-sqrt(2)/2) ] = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i).\n\nSimplify:\n\nsqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = (-2)/2 = -1. So, this becomes 64*(-1)(1 +i) = -64(1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2)[ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ] = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i).\n\nAgain, sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = -1. So, this becomes 64*(-1)(1 - i) = -64(1 - i).\n\nSo, now, the product becomes [1 - (1 + i)^13] * [1 - (1 - i)^13] = [1 - (-64)(1 + i)] * [1 - (-64)(1 - i)].\n\nSimplify each bracket:\n\nFirst bracket: 1 - (-64)(1 + i) = 1 +64(1 +i) = 1 +64 +64i =65 +64i.\n\nSecond bracket:1 - (-64)(1 -i) =1 +64(1 -i)=1 +64 -64i=65 -64i.\n\nSo, the product is (65 +64i)(65 -64i). That's a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's |65 +64i|\u00b2.\n\nCompute that: (65)^2 + (64)^2.\n\nCompute 65\u00b2: 65*65. 60\u00b2=3600, 5\u00b2=25, 2*60*5=600, so (60+5)\u00b2=60\u00b2 + 2*60*5 +5\u00b2= 3600 +600 +25=4225.\n\n64\u00b2: 64*64. 60\u00b2=3600, 4\u00b2=16, 2*60*4=480. So, (60+4)^2=60\u00b2 +2*60*4 +4\u00b2=3600 +480 +16=4096.\n\nAdding 4225 +4096: 4225 +4000=8225, plus 96=8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. So, the product from k=0 to12 of (2 -2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is equal to 8321.",

So each term (\u03c9^k - a) = - (a - \u03c9^k), so the product would be (-1)^13 times product (a - \u03c9^k) = - (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1).\n\nSo, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = - (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1).

Similarly for the other term, -65 +64i. Multiplying these gives ( -65)^2 + (64)^2, which is 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So the product is 8321.",

Correct.\n\n13\u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is the same as \u03c0/4 but in the third quadrant because 13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is equivalent to 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4, which is in the third quadrant. So, cos(5\u03c0/4) is -\u221a2/2, and sin is -\u221a2/2. So, e^{i5\u03c0/4} = (-\u221a2/2) - i\u221a2/2. So, when multiplied by 64\u221a2, that gives 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2). Let's compute 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2) = 64 * ( (-\u221a2 * \u221a2)/2 ) = 64*(-2/2) = 64*(-1) = -64. Similarly, for the imaginary part: 64\u221a2 * (-i\u221a2/2) = 64*(-i*(2)/2) = 64*(-i) = -64i. So, overall, (1 + i)^13 = (-64 -64i). Subtract 1, gives (-65 -64i). Correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) is \u221a2 e^{-i\u03c0/4}, so (1 - i)^13 is (\u221a2)^13 e^{-i13\u03c0/4} = 64\u221a2 e^{-i5\u03c0/4}. e^{-i5\u03c0/4} is cos(-5\u03c0/4) + i sin(-5\u03c0/4) = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2) + i\u221a2/2. So, 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2) = 64*(-1) + 64i = (-64 + 64i). Subtract 1 gives (-65 +64i). Correct.\n\nThen, the product (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (64^2)(i^2) = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nTherefore, the remainder is 321. So, I think that's the answer.",
