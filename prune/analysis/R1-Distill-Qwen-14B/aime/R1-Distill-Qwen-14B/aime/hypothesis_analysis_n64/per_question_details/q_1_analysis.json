          "text1": "Wait, sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so multiplying that by 2^{1/3} gives 2^{1/2 + 1/3}.\n\n1/2 + 1/3 is 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6. So, 2^{5/6}.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\ny = y * z\u00b2 * 2^{5/6}\n\nHmm, I can divide both sides by y (since y is positive, we can do that):\n\n1 = z\u00b2 * 2^{5/6}\n\nSo, z\u00b2 = 1 / (2^{5/6}) = 2^{-5/6}\n\nTaking square root,\n\nz = 2^{-5/12}  (since z is positive, we take the positive root)\n\nOkay, so now I know z in terms of exponents. Let me note that:\n\nz = 2^{-5/12}\n\nAlright, moving on. Now, perhaps I can substitute z back into another equation to find x or y. Let's try substituting z into equation (1) to find x in terms of y.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\nx = y z sqrt(2) = y * (2^{-5/12}) * 2^{1/2}\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\n2^{-5/12} * 2^{1/2} = 2^{-5/12 + 6/12} = 2^{1/12}\n\nSo, x = y * 2^{1/12}",
          "text2": "Wait, but then I can write this as y = 2^(5/6) y z\u00b2.\n\nHmm, so if I divide both sides by y (since y is positive, it can't be zero), I get 1 = 2^(5/6) z\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, z\u00b2 = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6).\n\nTaking square roots, z = 2^(-5/12). Because sqrt(2^(-5/6)) = 2^(-5/12). Since z is positive, we take the positive root.\n\nSo, z = 2^(-5/12). Got it.\n\nNow, let's find z in terms of exponents of 2. So, z = 2^(-5/12).\n\nNext, maybe I can find x and y. Let's go back to the first equation: x = sqrt(2) y z.\n\nBut I can also substitute z into this equation. Let me express sqrt(2) as 2^(1/2), and z is 2^(-5/12), so let's compute x in terms of y.\n\nx = 2^(1/2) * y * 2^(-5/12) = y * 2^(1/2 - 5/12).\n\nCompute the exponent: 1/2 is 6/12, so 6/12 - 5/12 = 1/12.\n\nSo, x = y * 2^(1/12). So x = y * 2^(1/12).\n\nNow, let's use the third equation to find another relationship. The third equation was z = x y * 2^(1/4).\n\nBut we know z is 2^(-5/12), so:\n\n2^(-5/12) = x y * 2^(1/4).\n\nBut we already have x = y * 2^(1/12). So substitute that:\n\n2^(-5/12) = (y * 2^(1/12)) * y * 2^(1/4).\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n(y * y) = y\u00b2.\n\nAnd 2^(1/12) * 2^(1/4) = 2^(1/12 + 3/12) = 2^(4/12) = 2^(1/3).\n\nSo, 2^(-5/12) = y\u00b2 * 2^(1/3).\n\nLet me solve for y\u00b2:\n\ny\u00b2 = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/3) = 2^(-5/12 - 4/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4).\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = 2^(-3/4). Therefore, y = 2^(-3/8), since y is positive.\n\nSo, y = 2^(-3/8).\n\nNow, we can find x from x = y * 2^(1/12).\n\nSubstituting y = 2^(-3/8):\n\nx = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8 + 1/12).\n\nCompute the exponent: -3/8 is -9/24, 1/12 is 2/24. So adding, -9/24 + 2/24 = -7/24.\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24).\n\nLet me summarize the values I have so far:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\ny = 2^(-3/8)\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nNow, I need to compute |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|.\n\nLet me compute the exponent part first: x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2.\n\nExpressed in terms of powers of 2, each variable is already a power of 2, so raising them to exponents will multiply the exponents.\n\nSo, x\u2074 = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-7/24 * 4) = 2^(-7/6)\n\nSimilarly, y\u00b3 = (2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8)\n\nz\u00b2 = (2^(-5/12))^2 = 2^(-5/6)\n\nMultiplying them together:\n\nx\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6) = 2^(-7/6 -9/8 -5/6)\n\nLet me compute the exponents:\n\nFirst, find a common denominator. The denominators are 6, 8, 6. The least common multiple is 24.\n\nConvert each fraction:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8 = -27/24\n\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nAdding them: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24\n\nSimplify -75/24: divide numerator and denominator by 3: -25/8.\n\nSo, x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-25/8).\n\nTherefore, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = log\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.\n\nTaking the absolute value: | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo the value is 25/8. The problem says m and n are coprime positive integers, so 25 and 8 share no common factors besides 1. Thus, m =25, n=8, so m +n=33.",

Therefore, the other factor must be zero:\n\nS * 2^(sum) - 1 = 0 --> S = 1 / 2^(sum)\n\nSo I need to compute sum = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n1/2 is 6/12\n\n1/3 is 4/12\n\n1/4 is 3/12\n\nSo sum is 6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12 = 13/12.\n\nSo sum = 13/12.\n\nTherefore, S = 1 / 2^(13/12) = 2^(-13/12)\n\nBut S = x y z, so x y z = 2^(-13/12)\n\nHmm, okay.

So total exponent is (-9 + 2)/24 = -7/24\n\nSo x = 2^(-7/24)\n\nLet me recap the values I have:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\ny = 2^(-3/8)\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nNow, I need to compute log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)\n\nWhich is log\u2082( (2^(-7/24))^4 * (2^(-3/8))^3 * (2^(-5/12))^2 )\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n(2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-7/24 *4) = 2^(-7/6)\n(2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8)\n(2^(-5/12))^2 = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nMultiply them together: 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6) = 2^(-7/6 -9/8 -5/6)\n\nCompute the exponent:\n\nLet's find a common denominator for 6, 8, 6. The least common multiple is 24.\n\nConvert each fraction:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n-9/8 = -27/24\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nAdd them together: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24\n\nSimplify: -75/24 can be reduced. Divide numerator and denominator by 3: -25/8\n\nSo the exponent is -25/8, so the product is 2^(-25/8)\n\nTherefore, log\u2082( x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 ) = log\u2082( 2^(-25/8) ) = -25/8\n\nTaking the absolute value: | -25/8 | = 25/8\n\nSo m is 25, n is 8. They are coprime.\n\nThus, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33",

But I need to find log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2). Maybe I can express x, y, z in terms of each other or find individual logs.\n\nLet me think: Let me denote a = log\u2082x, b = log\u2082y, c = log\u2082z. So, if I can find a, b, c, then log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = 4a + 3b + 2c, and then take the absolute value.\n\nSo, that's a good plan. Let me define:\n\na = log\u2082x \u21d2 x = 2^a\n\nb = log\u2082y \u21d2 y = 2^b\n\nc = log\u2082z \u21d2 z = 2^c\n\nThen, the original three equations can be rewritten in terms of a, b, c.\n\nEquation 1: log\u2082(x/(y z)) = 1/2\n\nSubstituting, log\u2082(2^a / (2^b * 2^c)) = 1/2\n\nSimplify the denominator: 2^b * 2^c = 2^{b + c}\n\nSo, inside the log: 2^a / 2^{b + c} = 2^{a - b - c}\n\nThus, log\u2082(2^{a - b - c}) = a - b - c = 1/2\n\nSo, equation 1 becomes: a - b - c = 1/2 \u2192 Equation (1a)\n\nSimilarly, equation 2: log\u2082(y/(x z)) = 1/3\n\nSubstituting: log\u2082(2^b / (2^a * 2^c)) = 1/3\n\nDenominator: 2^a * 2^c = 2^{a + c}\n\nInside the log: 2^{b - a - c}\n\nThus, log\u2082(2^{b - a - c}) = b - a - c = 1/3 \u2192 Equation (2a)\n\nEquation 3: log\u2082(z/(x y)) = 1/4\n\nSubstituting: log\u2082(2^c / (2^a * 2^b)) = 1/4\n\nDenominator: 2^a * 2^b = 2^{a + b}\n\nInside the log: 2^{c - a - b}\n\nThus, log\u2082(2^{c - a - b}) = c - a - b = 1/4 \u2192 Equation (3a)\n\nSo now, my system of equations is:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2 \u2192 Equation (1a)\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3 \u2192 Equation (2a)\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4 \u2192 Equation (3a)\n\nSo, I have three equations with variables a, b, c.\n\nLet me write them again:\n\nEquation (1a): a - b - c = 1/2 \u2192 (1a)\n\nEquation (2a): -a + b - c = 1/3 \u2192 (2a)\n\nEquation (3a): -a - b + c = 1/4 \u2192 (3a)\n\nNow, I can try to solve this system.

Now, let's find another variable. Let's take equation (2a): -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nWe know a is -7/24. Plugging that in:\n\n-(-7/24) + b - c = 1/3 \u2192 7/24 + b - c = 1/3\n\nCompute 1/3 as 8/24:\n\n7/24 + b - c = 8/24 \u2192 b - c = 8/24 -7/24 = 1/24 \u2192 Equation (5a): b - c = 1/24\n\nSimilarly, let's take equation (3a): -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nAgain, a is -7/24:\n\n-(-7/24) - b + c = 1/4 \u2192 7/24 - b + c = 1/4\n\nConvert 1/4 to 6/24:\n\n7/24 - b + c = 6/24 \u2192 -b + c = 6/24 -7/24 = -1/24 \u2192 Equation (6a): -b + c = -1/24\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n(5a): b - c = 1/24\n\n(6a): -b + c = -1/24\n\nLet me write them together:\n\n1. b - c = 1/24\n\n2. -b + c = -1/24\n\nHmm, if I add these two equations together:\n\n(b - c) + (-b + c) = 1/24 + (-1/24)\n\nLeft side: 0 = 0\n\nRight side: 0\n\nSo, the equations are dependent, which makes sense because we have three equations and are solving for three variables, but after substitution, some may become dependent.\n\nSo, let me pick one equation to solve for one variable. Let's take equation (5a): b - c = 1/24 \u2192 b = c + 1/24\n\nNow, let's plug this into equation (4a): a + b + c = -13/12\n\nWe have a = -7/24, and b = c + 1/24.\n\nSo,\n\n-7/24 + (c + 1/24) + c = -13/12\n\nSimplify:\n\n-7/24 + c + 1/24 + c = -13/12\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-7/24 + 1/24) + 2c = -13/12\n\n(-6/24) + 2c = -13/12\n\nSimplify -6/24 to -1/4:\n\n-1/4 + 2c = -13/12\n\nNow, let's solve for c:\n\n2c = -13/12 + 1/4\n\nConvert 1/4 to 3/12:\n\n2c = -13/12 + 3/12 = (-13 + 3)/12 = (-10)/12 = -5/6\n\nSo, 2c = -5/6 \u2192 c = (-5/6)/2 = -5/12\n\nSo, c = -5/12\n\nNow, from equation (5a): b = c + 1/24\n\nc is -5/12, which is -10/24.\n\nSo, b = (-10/24) + 1/24 = (-9)/24 = -3/8\n\nThus, b = -3/8\n\nSo, to recap:\n\na = -7/24\n\nb = -3/8\n\nc = -5/12\n\nNow, let's check if these satisfy the original equations to avoid mistakes.\n\nCheck equation (1a): a - b - c = (-7/24) - (-3/8) - (-5/12)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-7/24\n\n- (-3/8) = +3/8 = 9/24\n\n- (-5/12) = +5/12 = 10/24\n\nSo, sum: (-7 + 9 + 10)/24 = 12/24 = 1/2 \u2192 Correct, matches equation (1a)\n\nCheck equation (2a): -a + b - c = -(-7/24) + (-3/8) - (-5/12)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n7/24\n\n-3/8 = -9/24\n\n5/12 = 10/24\n\nSum: 7 -9 +10 =8 \u2192 8/24 = 1/3 \u2192 Correct, matches equation (2a)\n\nCheck equation (3a): -a - b + c = -(-7/24) - (-3/8) + (-5/12)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n7/24\n\n- (-3/8) = +3/8 = 9/24\n\n-5/12 = -10/24\n\nSum: 7 +9 -10 =6 \u2192 6/24 = 1/4 \u2192 Correct, matches equation (3a)\n\nSo, all equations are satisfied. Good.\n\nNow, the question is to find |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|.\n\nWhich is |4a + 3b + 2c|\n\nSince a, b, c are exponents in log\u2082(x), etc., so x = 2^a, y=2^b, z=2^c.\n\nSo, x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = (2^a)^4 * (2^b)^3 * (2^c)^2 = 2^{4a + 3b + 2c}\n\nThus, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = 4a +3b +2c\n\nSo, let's compute 4a +3b +2c with a= -7/24, b= -3/8, c= -5/12.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n4a = 4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = (-7)/6 \u2248 -1.1667\n\n3b = 3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8 \u2248 -1.125\n\n2c = 2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6 \u2248 -0.8333\n\nNow, sum them up:\n\n(-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)\n\nLet me convert all to 24 denominators.\n\n-7/6 = (-28)/24\n\n-9/8 = (-27)/24\n\n-5/6 = (-20)/24\n\nSum: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24\n\nSimplify: -75/24 = -25/8",

          "text1": "Wait, maybe a better approach is to express all variables in terms of x, then find x.\n\nSo, starting with x = y z * 2^(1/2) --> equation 1.\n\nFrom equation 2: y = x z * 2^(1/3).\n\nFrom equation 3: z = x y * 2^(1/4).\n\nSo, I can substitute equation 3 into equation 2.\n\nEquation 2: y = x*(equation 3)*2^(1/3) = x*(x y * 2^(1/4)) * 2^(1/3).\n\nSo, y = x\u00b2 y * 2^(1/4 + 1/3) = x\u00b2 y * 2^(7/12).\n\nDivide both sides by y: 1 = x\u00b2 * 2^(7/12), which again gives x\u00b2 = 2^(-7/12), so x = 2^(-7/24). Same as before.\n\nNow, let's express z from equation 3: z = x y * 2^(1/4). But I don't know y yet. Let's express y from equation 2 in terms of x and z, which is y = x z * 2^(1/3). But I also have equation 1: x = y z * 2^(1/2). Let me substitute y from equation 2 into equation 1.\n\nSo, equation 1: x = (x z * 2^(1/3)) * z * 2^(1/2).\n\nSimplify that: x = x z\u00b2 * 2^(1/3 + 1/2).\n\nCalculating exponents: 1/3 + 1/2 is 2/6 + 3/6 = 5/6. So, 2^(5/6).\n\nSo, x = x z\u00b2 * 2^(5/6).\n\nDivide both sides by x (since x is positive, non-zero): 1 = z\u00b2 * 2^(5/6).\n\nSo, z\u00b2 = 2^(-5/6). Therefore, z = 2^(-5/12).\n\nSo z is 2^(-5/12). Now, since I have z, perhaps I can find y.\n\nFrom equation 3: z = x y * 2^(1/4). So, 2^(-5/12) = x y * 2^(1/4).\n\nWe already have x = 2^(-7/24), so substitute that in:\n\n2^(-5/12) = (2^(-7/24)) * y * 2^(1/4).\n\nLet me compute the exponents on the right:\n\n2^(-7/24) * 2^(1/4) = 2^(-7/24 + 6/24) = 2^(-1/24).\n\nSo, 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-1/24) * y.\n\nSo, y = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(-1/24) = 2^(-5/12 + 1/24).\n\nConvert to same denominator: 5/12 is 10/24. So, -10/24 + 1/24 = -9/24 = -3/8.\n\nSo y = 2^(-3/8).\n\nSo now, we have:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-3/8), z = 2^(-5/12).\n\nLet me verify these values with equation 1 to make sure.\n\nEquation 1: log\u2082(x/(y z)) = 1/2.\n\nCompute x/(y z) = [2^(-7/24)] / [2^(-3/8) * 2^(-5/12)].\n\nLet me add the exponents in the denominator:\n\n-3/8 + (-5/12) = -3/8 -5/12. Let's compute this:\n\nConvert to 24 denominator. -9/24 -10/24 = -19/24.\n\nSo denominator is 2^(-19/24). So numerator is 2^(-7/24). So overall, x/(y z) = 2^(-7/24) / 2^(-19/24) = 2^( (-7 +19)/24 ) = 2^(12/24) = 2^(1/2) = \u221a2. So log\u2082(\u221a2) = 1/2. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, check equation 2: log\u2082(y/(x z)) = 1/3.\n\nCompute y/(x z) = 2^(-3/8) / [2^(-7/24) * 2^(-5/12)].\n\nAdd exponents in denominator: -7/24 + (-5/12) = -7/24 -10/24 = -17/24.\n\nSo denominator is 2^(-17/24). Numerator is 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24).\n\nSo y/(x z) = 2^(-9/24) / 2^(-17/24) = 2^(8/24) = 2^(1/3). So log\u2082(2^(1/3)) = 1/3. Correct.\n\nEquation 3: log\u2082(z/(x y)) = 1/4.\n\nCompute z/(x y) = 2^(-5/12) / [2^(-7/24) * 2^(-3/8)].\n\nCompute denominator exponents: -7/24 + (-9/24) = (-16/24) = -2/3.\n\nSo denominator is 2^(-2/3). Numerator is 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24).\n\nSo z/(x y) = 2^(-10/24) / 2^(-16/24) = 2^(6/24) = 2^(1/4). So log\u2082(2^(1/4)) = 1/4. Correct.\n\nAlright, so the values of x, y, z are correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks for |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|. Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, compute x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2. Since x, y, z are powers of 2, their product will be 2 raised to some exponent.\n\nSo, x\u2074 = [2^(-7/24)]\u2074 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6).\n\ny\u00b3 = [2^(-3/8)]\u00b3 = 2^(-9/8).\n\nz\u00b2 = [2^(-5/12)]\u00b2 = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6).\n\nSo, multiplying them together: x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6).\n\nAdding exponents: (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6).\n\nFirst, let's combine the terms with denominator 6 and 8. Let me convert all fractions to 24 denominator.\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8 = -27/24\n\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nSo total exponent: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8.\n\nSo x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-25/8).\n\nThen, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = log\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.\n\nTaking absolute value: | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo the value is 25/8.

Let's find a common denominator, which is 24.\n\n-7/6 = -28/24,\n-9/8 = -27/24,\n-5/6 = -20/24.\n\nAdding them: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24.\n\nSimplify: -75/24. Let's see if this reduces.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3: 75 \u00f7 3 =25, 24 \u00f7 3=8. So, -25/8.\n\nSo, x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-25/8).\n\nThus, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = log\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.\n\nThe absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo, the value is 25/8, which is already in lowest terms because 25 and 8 share no common divisors except 1.\n\nTherefore, m =25, n=8, and m +n= 33.",

So that's okay.\n\nSo c = -5/12\n\nNow, let's plug c back into equation 1 or 2 to find a relationship between a and b.\n\nLet's take equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2\n\nWe know c = -5/12, so:\n\na - b - (-5/12) = 1/2\n\nWhich is a - b + 5/12 = 1/2\n\nSubtract 5/12 from both sides:\n\na - b = 1/2 - 5/12 = (6/12 - 5/12) = 1/12\n\nSo equation 5: a - b = 1/12\n\nSimilarly, let's take equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nAgain, c = -5/12:\n\n-a + b - (-5/12) = 1/3\n\nWhich is -a + b + 5/12 = 1/3\n\nSubtract 5/12:\n\n-a + b = 1/3 - 5/12 = (4/12 - 5/12) = -1/12\n\nSo equation 6: -a + b = -1/12\n\nNow, we have equations 5 and 6:\n\nEquation 5: a - b = 1/12\n\nEquation 6: -a + b = -1/12\n\nLet me write them:\n\n1. a - b = 1/12\n\n2. -a + b = -1/12\n\nHmm, adding these two equations:\n\n(a - b) + (-a + b) = 1/12 - 1/12\n\nLeft side: 0 = 0\n\nRight side: 0\n\nSo, that doesn't give me new information. Hmm, maybe I can solve equations 5 and 6 together.\n\nFrom equation 5: a = b + 1/12\n\nSubstitute into equation 6:\n\n- (b + 1/12) + b = -1/12\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n- b - 1/12 + b = -1/12\n\nWhich reduces to (-1/12) = -1/12.\n\nHmm, that's an identity, so it doesn't help us find a specific value. Therefore, perhaps we need to use another equation, equation 3.\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nWe know c = -5/12, so:\n\n-a - b + (-5/12) = 1/4\n\nWhich is: -a - b = 1/4 + 5/12 = (3/12 + 5/12) = 8/12 = 2/3\n\nSo equation 7: -a - b = 2/3\n\nBut from equation 5: a = b + 1/12\n\nLet me substitute a in equation 7:\n\n- (b + 1/12) - b = 2/3\n\nSimplify:\n\n- b - 1/12 - b = 2/3\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-2b - 1/12 = 2/3\n\nAdd 1/12 to both sides:\n\n-2b = 2/3 + 1/12\n\nConvert to twelfths: 2/3 = 8/12\n\nSo 8/12 + 1/12 = 9/12 = 3/4\n\nSo:\n\n-2b = 3/4\n\nDivide both sides by -2:\n\nb = (3/4)/(-2) = -3/8\n\nSo b = -3/8\n\nThen from equation 5: a = b + 1/12 = (-3/8) + (1/12)\n\nConvert to 24 denominators:\n\n-3/8 = -9/24\n\n1/12 = 2/24\n\nSo a = (-9/24) + (2/24) = (-7/24)\n\nSo a = -7/24\n\nSo let's recap:\n\na = log\u2082 x = -7/24\n\nb = log\u2082 y = -3/8\n\nc = log\u2082 z = -5/12\n\nNow, the problem asks for |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|\n\nLet me compute log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) first.\n\nUsing logarithm properties: log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = log\u2082 x\u2074 + log\u2082 y\u00b3 + log\u2082 z\u00b2 = 4 log\u2082 x + 3 log\u2082 y + 2 log\u2082 z\n\nWhich is 4a + 3b + 2c\n\nSo plug in the values:\n\n4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = (-7)/6\n\n3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8\n\n2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6\n\nSo add them together:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nCombine terms.

So in terms of a, b, c: a - b - c = 1/2 ...(1)\n\nSimilarly, the second equation: log\u2082(y/(xz)) = 1/3. Which is log\u2082y - log\u2082x - log\u2082z = 1/3. So, b - a - c = 1/3 ...(2)\n\nThird equation: log\u2082(z/(xy)) = 1/4. So log\u2082z - log\u2082x - log\u2082y = 1/4. Which is c - a - b = 1/4 ...(3)\n\nSo now I have a system of linear equations:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nHmm, let me write these equations clearly:\n\nEquation 1: a - b - c = 1/2\n\nEquation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nI need to solve for a, b, c.

Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, compute the expression inside the log:\n\nx\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2\n\nSince x, y, z are powers of 2, let's write each term as a power of 2:\n\nx\u2074 = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6)\n\ny\u00b3 = (2^(-9/24))^3 = 2^(-27/24) = 2^(-9/8)\n\nz\u00b2 = (2^(-10/24))^2 = 2^(-20/24) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nSo, multiplying these together:\n\nx\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6)\n\nSince they have the same base, add the exponents:\n\nTotal exponent = (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst, let's convert all to 24 denominators to add them easily.\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n-9/8 = -27/24\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nAdding them together:\n\n-28/24 -27/24 -20/24 = (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24\n\nSo, x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-75/24)\n\nSimplify the exponent:\n\n-75/24 can be reduced. 75 and 24 are both divisible by 3.\n\n75 \u00f7 3 = 25\n24 \u00f73 = 8\n\nSo, -75/24 = -25/8\n\nThus, x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-25/8)\n\nSo, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = log\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8\n\nNow, the problem asks for the absolute value of that, so | -25/8 | = 25/8\n\n25 and 8 are coprime because 25 is 5\u00b2 and 8 is 2\u00b3, and they share no common factors besides 1.\n\nSo, m =25, n=8, m +n=33.",

Since y is positive.\n\nSo, y = 2^(-3/8).\n\nNow, from Eq5, x = y * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8 + 1/12)\n\nLet me compute the exponents: -3/8 is -9/24, and 1/12 is 2/24. So, adding those gives (-9 + 2)/24 = -7/24.\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24).\n\nSo, now I have x, y, z:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\ny = 2^(-3/8)\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nLet me verify these with the original equations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst equation: log\u2082(x/(y z))\n\nCompute x/(y z):\n\nx = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24), z = 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24)\n\nSo, y z = 2^(-9/24) * 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-19/24)\n\nx/(y z) = [2^(-7/24)] / [2^(-19/24)] = 2^(-7/24 + 19/24) = 2^(12/24) = 2^(1/2) = sqrt(2)\n\nlog\u2082(sqrt(2)) = 1/2, which matches the first equation. Good.\n\nSecond equation: log\u2082(y/(x z)).\n\nCompute y/(x z):\n\ny = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24)\nx z = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-17/24)\nSo, y/(x z) = 2^(-9/24) / 2^(-17/24) = 2^(8/24) = 2^(1/3), which is correct, log\u2082(2^(1/3)) = 1/3.\n\nThird equation: log\u2082(z/(x y)).\n\nCompute z/(x y):\n\nz = 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24)\nx y = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-16/24) = 2^(-2/3)\nSo, z/(x y) = [2^(-10/24)] / [2^(-16/24)] = 2^(6/24) = 2^(1/4). So, log\u2082(2^(1/4)) = 1/4. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the values of x, y, z are correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks for |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|.\n\nLet me compute this expression.\n\nFirst, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = 4 log\u2082 x + 3 log\u2082 y + 2 log\u2082 z.\n\nSince logs turn exponents into multipliers.\n\nSo, let's compute each term:\n\nlog\u2082 x = log\u2082 (2^(-7/24)) = -7/24\n\nlog\u2082 y = log\u2082 (2^(-3/8)) = -3/8\n\nlog\u2082 z = log\u2082 (2^(-5/12)) = -5/12\n\nSo, plug these into the expression:\n\n4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12)\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = (-7)/6\n\n3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8\n\n2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6\n\nNow, sum these together:\n\n(-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)\n\nFirst, let's find a common denominator. The denominators are 6,8,6. The least common multiple is 24.\n\nConvert each fraction:\n\n-7/6 = (-28)/24\n\n-9/8 = (-27)/24\n\n-5/6 = (-20)/24\n\nNow, adding them together:\n\n(-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24\n\nSimplify this fraction:\n\n-75 and 24 are both divisible by 3.\n\n75 \u00f7 3 = 25, 24 \u00f73 =8.\n\nSo, (-25)/8.\n\nThe absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo, the value is 25/8, which is already in lowest terms since 25 and 8 share no common divisors besides 1.\n\nTherefore, m =25, n=8. m + n = 33.",

Now, let's find another variable. Let's take equation (2a): -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nWe know a is -7/24. Plugging that in:\n\n-(-7/24) + b - c = 1/3 \u2192 7/24 + b - c = 1/3\n\nCompute 1/3 as 8/24:\n\n7/24 + b - c = 8/24 \u2192 b - c = 8/24 -7/24 = 1/24 \u2192 Equation (5a): b - c = 1/24\n\nSimilarly, let's take equation (3a): -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nAgain, a is -7/24:\n\n-(-7/24) - b + c = 1/4 \u2192 7/24 - b + c = 1/4\n\nConvert 1/4 to 6/24:\n\n7/24 - b + c = 6/24 \u2192 -b + c = 6/24 -7/24 = -1/24 \u2192 Equation (6a): -b + c = -1/24\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n(5a): b - c = 1/24\n\n(6a): -b + c = -1/24\n\nLet me write them together:\n\n1. b - c = 1/24\n\n2. -b + c = -1/24\n\nHmm, if I add these two equations together:\n\n(b - c) + (-b + c) = 1/24 + (-1/24)\n\nLeft side: 0 = 0\n\nRight side: 0\n\nSo, the equations are dependent, which makes sense because we have three equations and are solving for three variables, but after substitution, some may become dependent.\n\nSo, let me pick one equation to solve for one variable. Let's take equation (5a): b - c = 1/24 \u2192 b = c + 1/24\n\nNow, let's plug this into equation (4a): a + b + c = -13/12\n\nWe have a = -7/24, and b = c + 1/24.\n\nSo,\n\n-7/24 + (c + 1/24) + c = -13/12\n\nSimplify:\n\n-7/24 + c + 1/24 + c = -13/12\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-7/24 + 1/24) + 2c = -13/12\n\n(-6/24) + 2c = -13/12\n\nSimplify -6/24 to -1/4:\n\n-1/4 + 2c = -13/12\n\nNow, let's solve for c:\n\n2c = -13/12 + 1/4\n\nConvert 1/4 to 3/12:\n\n2c = -13/12 + 3/12 = (-13 + 3)/12 = (-10)/12 = -5/6\n\nSo, 2c = -5/6 \u2192 c = (-5/6)/2 = -5/12\n\nSo, c = -5/12\n\nNow, from equation (5a): b = c + 1/24\n\nc is -5/12, which is -10/24.\n\nSo, b = (-10/24) + 1/24 = (-9)/24 = -3/8\n\nThus, b = -3/8\n\nSo, to recap:\n\na = -7/24\n\nb = -3/8\n\nc = -5/12\n\nNow, let's check if these satisfy the original equations to avoid mistakes.\n\nCheck equation (1a): a - b - c = (-7/24) - (-3/8) - (-5/12)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-7/24\n\n- (-3/8) = +3/8 = 9/24\n\n- (-5/12) = +5/12 = 10/24\n\nSo, sum: (-7 + 9 + 10)/24 = 12/24 = 1/2 \u2192 Correct, matches equation (1a)\n\nCheck equation (2a): -a + b - c = -(-7/24) + (-3/8) - (-5/12)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n7/24\n\n-3/8 = -9/24\n\n5/12 = 10/24\n\nSum: 7 -9 +10 =8 \u2192 8/24 = 1/3 \u2192 Correct, matches equation (2a)\n\nCheck equation (3a): -a - b + c = -(-7/24) - (-3/8) + (-5/12)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n7/24\n\n- (-3/8) = +3/8 = 9/24\n\n-5/12 = -10/24\n\nSum: 7 +9 -10 =6 \u2192 6/24 = 1/4 \u2192 Correct, matches equation (3a)\n\nSo, all equations are satisfied. Good.\n\nNow, the question is to find |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|.\n\nWhich is |4a + 3b + 2c|\n\nSince a, b, c are exponents in log\u2082(x), etc., so x = 2^a, y=2^b, z=2^c.\n\nSo, x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = (2^a)^4 * (2^b)^3 * (2^c)^2 = 2^{4a + 3b + 2c}\n\nThus, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = 4a +3b +2c\n\nSo, let's compute 4a +3b +2c with a= -7/24, b= -3/8, c= -5/12.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n4a = 4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = (-7)/6 \u2248 -1.1667\n\n3b = 3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8 \u2248 -1.125\n\n2c = 2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6 \u2248 -0.8333\n\nNow, sum them up:\n\n(-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)\n\nLet me convert all to 24 denominators.\n\n-7/6 = (-28)/24\n\n-9/8 = (-27)/24\n\n-5/6 = (-20)/24\n\nSum: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24\n\nSimplify: -75/24 = -25/8",

To add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 2, 3, 4. The least common denominator is 12.\n\nSo converting each:\n\n1/2 = 6/12\n\n1/3 = 4/12\n\n1/4 = 3/12\n\nAdding them together: 6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12 = 13/12.\n\nSo the product of the right-hand sides is 2^(13/12).\n\nPutting it all together: 1/(x y z) = 2^(13/12), so x y z = 1 / 2^(13/12) = 2^(-13/12).\n\nThat's a useful equation. So x y z = 2^(-13/12).\n\nNow, I need to find log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2). Let's express that as log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = log\u2082(x^4) + log\u2082(y^3) + log\u2082(z^2) = 4 log\u2082 x + 3 log\u2082 y + 2 log\u2082 z.\n\nSo, if I can find log\u2082 x, log\u2082 y, and log\u2082 z, I can compute this expression.",

Let me convert all fractions to 24 denominator.\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8 = -27/24\n\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nSo total exponent: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8.\n\nSo x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-25/8).\n\nThen, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = log\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.\n\nTaking absolute value: | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo the value is 25/8. Since 25 and 8 are coprime, m =25 and n=8, so m +n=33.",

So 13/12.\n\nSo, -a - b - c = 13/12 --> a + b + c = -13/12\n\nLet me note that as equation 4: a + b + c = -13/12\n\nNow, I can use equations 1, 2, 3 with equation 4.\n\nFrom equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2\n\nEquation 4: a + b + c = -13/12\n\nIf I add equation 1 and equation 4:\n\n(a - b - c) + (a + b + c) = 1/2 + (-13/12)\n\nLeft side: 2a\n\nRight side: 6/12 -13/12 = (-7)/12\n\nSo 2a = -7/12 --> a = (-7)/24\n\nHmm, so a is -7/24.\n\nSimilarly, let's subtract equation 1 from equation 4:\n\n(a + b + c) - (a - b - c) = (-13/12) - (1/2)\n\nLeft side: 2b + 2c\n\nRight side: -13/12 -6/12 = -19/12\n\nSo, 2(b + c) = -19/12 --> b + c = -19/24\n\nHmm, keep that aside.\n\nNow, let me take equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nWe know a = -7/24, so plug that in:\n\n-(-7/24) + b - c = 1/3 --> 7/24 + b - c = 1/3\n\nConvert 1/3 to 8/24:\n\n7/24 + b - c = 8/24 --> b - c = 1/24\n\nSo equation 5: b - c = 1/24\n\nEarlier, we have:\n\nb + c = -19/24 (from subtracting equation 1 from equation 4)\n\nSo now, we have two equations in b and c:\n\nEquation 5: b - c = 1/24\n\nEquation 6: b + c = -19/24\n\nLet me add these two equations:\n\n(b - c) + (b + c) = 1/24 + (-19/24)\n\nLeft side: 2b\n\nRight side: (-18)/24 = -3/4\n\nSo 2b = -3/4 --> b = -3/8\n\nNow, substitute b back into equation 6: (-3/8) + c = -19/24\n\nSolving for c: c = -19/24 + 3/8\n\nConvert 3/8 to 9/24:\n\nc = -19/24 + 9/24 = (-10)/24 = -5/12\n\nSo, c = -5/12\n\nSo now I have a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12.\n\nLet me just check if these satisfy equation 3.\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nPlug in a, b, c:\n\n-(-7/24) - (-3/8) + (-5/12) = ?\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-(-7/24) = 7/24\n\n-(-3/8) = 3/8 = 9/24\n\n+ (-5/12) = -5/12 = -10/24\n\nSo adding them: 7/24 + 9/24 -10/24 = (7 +9 -10)/24 = 6/24 = 1/4\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12.\n\nNow, the expression we need is |4a + 3b + 2c|.\n\nLet's compute 4a +3b +2c.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n4a = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6\n\n3b = 3*(-3/8) = -9/8\n\n2c = 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6\n\nNow add them together:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nFirst, combine -7/6 and -5/6: (-7 -5)/6 = -12/6 = -2\n\nThen, add -9/8: -2 -9/8 = (-16/8 -9/8) = -25/8\n\nSo, 4a +3b +2c = -25/8\n\nTaking absolute value: | -25/8 | = 25/8\n\nSo the value is 25/8.",

Let's find a common denominator, which is 24.\n\n-7/6 = -28/24,\n-9/8 = -27/24,\n-5/6 = -20/24.\n\nAdding them: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24.\n\nSimplify: -75/24. Let's see if this reduces.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3: 75 \u00f7 3 =25, 24 \u00f7 3=8. So, -25/8.\n\nSo, x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-25/8).\n\nThus, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = log\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.\n\nThe absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo, the value is 25/8, which is already in lowest terms because 25 and 8 share no common divisors except 1.\n\nTherefore, m =25, n=8, and m +n= 33.",

Since y is positive.\n\nSo, y = 2^(-3/8).\n\nNow, from Eq5, x = y * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8 + 1/12)\n\nLet me compute the exponents: -3/8 is -9/24, and 1/12 is 2/24. So, adding those gives (-9 + 2)/24 = -7/24.\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24).\n\nSo, now I have x, y, z:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\ny = 2^(-3/8)\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nLet me verify these with the original equations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst equation: log\u2082(x/(y z))\n\nCompute x/(y z):\n\nx = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24), z = 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24)\n\nSo, y z = 2^(-9/24) * 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-19/24)\n\nx/(y z) = [2^(-7/24)] / [2^(-19/24)] = 2^(-7/24 + 19/24) = 2^(12/24) = 2^(1/2) = sqrt(2)\n\nlog\u2082(sqrt(2)) = 1/2, which matches the first equation. Good.\n\nSecond equation: log\u2082(y/(x z)).\n\nCompute y/(x z):\n\ny = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24)\nx z = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-17/24)\nSo, y/(x z) = 2^(-9/24) / 2^(-17/24) = 2^(8/24) = 2^(1/3), which is correct, log\u2082(2^(1/3)) = 1/3.\n\nThird equation: log\u2082(z/(x y)).\n\nCompute z/(x y):\n\nz = 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24)\nx y = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-16/24) = 2^(-2/3)\nSo, z/(x y) = [2^(-10/24)] / [2^(-16/24)] = 2^(6/24) = 2^(1/4). So, log\u2082(2^(1/4)) = 1/4. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the values of x, y, z are correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks for |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|.\n\nLet me compute this expression.\n\nFirst, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = 4 log\u2082 x + 3 log\u2082 y + 2 log\u2082 z.\n\nSince logs turn exponents into multipliers.\n\nSo, let's compute each term:\n\nlog\u2082 x = log\u2082 (2^(-7/24)) = -7/24\n\nlog\u2082 y = log\u2082 (2^(-3/8)) = -3/8\n\nlog\u2082 z = log\u2082 (2^(-5/12)) = -5/12\n\nSo, plug these into the expression:\n\n4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12)\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = (-7)/6\n\n3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8\n\n2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6\n\nNow, sum these together:\n\n(-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)\n\nFirst, let's find a common denominator. The denominators are 6,8,6. The least common multiple is 24.\n\nConvert each fraction:\n\n-7/6 = (-28)/24\n\n-9/8 = (-27)/24\n\n-5/6 = (-20)/24\n\nNow, adding them together:\n\n(-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24\n\nSimplify this fraction:\n\n-75 and 24 are both divisible by 3.\n\n75 \u00f7 3 = 25, 24 \u00f73 =8.\n\nSo, (-25)/8.\n\nThe absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo, the value is 25/8, which is already in lowest terms since 25 and 8 share no common divisors besides 1.\n\nTherefore, m =25, n=8. m + n = 33.",

Now, let's find another variable. Let's take equation (2a): -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nWe know a is -7/24. Plugging that in:\n\n-(-7/24) + b - c = 1/3 \u2192 7/24 + b - c = 1/3\n\nCompute 1/3 as 8/24:\n\n7/24 + b - c = 8/24 \u2192 b - c = 8/24 -7/24 = 1/24 \u2192 Equation (5a): b - c = 1/24\n\nSimilarly, let's take equation (3a): -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nAgain, a is -7/24:\n\n-(-7/24) - b + c = 1/4 \u2192 7/24 - b + c = 1/4\n\nConvert 1/4 to 6/24:\n\n7/24 - b + c = 6/24 \u2192 -b + c = 6/24 -7/24 = -1/24 \u2192 Equation (6a): -b + c = -1/24\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n(5a): b - c = 1/24\n\n(6a): -b + c = -1/24\n\nLet me write them together:\n\n1. b - c = 1/24\n\n2. -b + c = -1/24\n\nHmm, if I add these two equations together:\n\n(b - c) + (-b + c) = 1/24 + (-1/24)\n\nLeft side: 0 = 0\n\nRight side: 0\n\nSo, the equations are dependent, which makes sense because we have three equations and are solving for three variables, but after substitution, some may become dependent.\n\nSo, let me pick one equation to solve for one variable. Let's take equation (5a): b - c = 1/24 \u2192 b = c + 1/24\n\nNow, let's plug this into equation (4a): a + b + c = -13/12\n\nWe have a = -7/24, and b = c + 1/24.\n\nSo,\n\n-7/24 + (c + 1/24) + c = -13/12\n\nSimplify:\n\n-7/24 + c + 1/24 + c = -13/12\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-7/24 + 1/24) + 2c = -13/12\n\n(-6/24) + 2c = -13/12\n\nSimplify -6/24 to -1/4:\n\n-1/4 + 2c = -13/12\n\nNow, let's solve for c:\n\n2c = -13/12 + 1/4\n\nConvert 1/4 to 3/12:\n\n2c = -13/12 + 3/12 = (-13 + 3)/12 = (-10)/12 = -5/6\n\nSo, 2c = -5/6 \u2192 c = (-5/6)/2 = -5/12\n\nSo, c = -5/12\n\nNow, from equation (5a): b = c + 1/24\n\nc is -5/12, which is -10/24.\n\nSo, b = (-10/24) + 1/24 = (-9)/24 = -3/8\n\nThus, b = -3/8\n\nSo, to recap:\n\na = -7/24\n\nb = -3/8\n\nc = -5/12\n\nNow, let's check if these satisfy the original equations to avoid mistakes.\n\nCheck equation (1a): a - b - c = (-7/24) - (-3/8) - (-5/12)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-7/24\n\n- (-3/8) = +3/8 = 9/24\n\n- (-5/12) = +5/12 = 10/24\n\nSo, sum: (-7 + 9 + 10)/24 = 12/24 = 1/2 \u2192 Correct, matches equation (1a)\n\nCheck equation (2a): -a + b - c = -(-7/24) + (-3/8) - (-5/12)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n7/24\n\n-3/8 = -9/24\n\n5/12 = 10/24\n\nSum: 7 -9 +10 =8 \u2192 8/24 = 1/3 \u2192 Correct, matches equation (2a)\n\nCheck equation (3a): -a - b + c = -(-7/24) - (-3/8) + (-5/12)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n7/24\n\n- (-3/8) = +3/8 = 9/24\n\n-5/12 = -10/24\n\nSum: 7 +9 -10 =6 \u2192 6/24 = 1/4 \u2192 Correct, matches equation (3a)\n\nSo, all equations are satisfied. Good.\n\nNow, the question is to find |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|.\n\nWhich is |4a + 3b + 2c|\n\nSince a, b, c are exponents in log\u2082(x), etc., so x = 2^a, y=2^b, z=2^c.\n\nSo, x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = (2^a)^4 * (2^b)^3 * (2^c)^2 = 2^{4a + 3b + 2c}\n\nThus, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = 4a +3b +2c\n\nSo, let's compute 4a +3b +2c with a= -7/24, b= -3/8, c= -5/12.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n4a = 4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = (-7)/6 \u2248 -1.1667\n\n3b = 3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8 \u2248 -1.125\n\n2c = 2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6 \u2248 -0.8333\n\nNow, sum them up:\n\n(-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)\n\nLet me convert all to 24 denominators.\n\n-7/6 = (-28)/24\n\n-9/8 = (-27)/24\n\n-5/6 = (-20)/24\n\nSum: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24\n\nSimplify: -75/24 = -25/8",

To add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 2, 3, 4. The least common denominator is 12.\n\nSo converting each:\n\n1/2 = 6/12\n\n1/3 = 4/12\n\n1/4 = 3/12\n\nAdding them together: 6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12 = 13/12.\n\nSo the product of the right-hand sides is 2^(13/12).\n\nPutting it all together: 1/(x y z) = 2^(13/12), so x y z = 1 / 2^(13/12) = 2^(-13/12).\n\nThat's a useful equation. So x y z = 2^(-13/12).\n\nNow, I need to find log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2). Let's express that as log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = log\u2082(x^4) + log\u2082(y^3) + log\u2082(z^2) = 4 log\u2082 x + 3 log\u2082 y + 2 log\u2082 z.\n\nSo, if I can find log\u2082 x, log\u2082 y, and log\u2082 z, I can compute this expression.",

Let me convert all fractions to 24 denominator.\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8 = -27/24\n\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nSo total exponent: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8.\n\nSo x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-25/8).\n\nThen, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = log\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.\n\nTaking absolute value: | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo the value is 25/8. Since 25 and 8 are coprime, m =25 and n=8, so m +n=33.",

So 13/12.\n\nSo, -a - b - c = 13/12 --> a + b + c = -13/12\n\nLet me note that as equation 4: a + b + c = -13/12\n\nNow, I can use equations 1, 2, 3 with equation 4.\n\nFrom equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2\n\nEquation 4: a + b + c = -13/12\n\nIf I add equation 1 and equation 4:\n\n(a - b - c) + (a + b + c) = 1/2 + (-13/12)\n\nLeft side: 2a\n\nRight side: 6/12 -13/12 = (-7)/12\n\nSo 2a = -7/12 --> a = (-7)/24\n\nHmm, so a is -7/24.\n\nSimilarly, let's subtract equation 1 from equation 4:\n\n(a + b + c) - (a - b - c) = (-13/12) - (1/2)\n\nLeft side: 2b + 2c\n\nRight side: -13/12 -6/12 = -19/12\n\nSo, 2(b + c) = -19/12 --> b + c = -19/24\n\nHmm, keep that aside.\n\nNow, let me take equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nWe know a = -7/24, so plug that in:\n\n-(-7/24) + b - c = 1/3 --> 7/24 + b - c = 1/3\n\nConvert 1/3 to 8/24:\n\n7/24 + b - c = 8/24 --> b - c = 1/24\n\nSo equation 5: b - c = 1/24\n\nEarlier, we have:\n\nb + c = -19/24 (from subtracting equation 1 from equation 4)\n\nSo now, we have two equations in b and c:\n\nEquation 5: b - c = 1/24\n\nEquation 6: b + c = -19/24\n\nLet me add these two equations:\n\n(b - c) + (b + c) = 1/24 + (-19/24)\n\nLeft side: 2b\n\nRight side: (-18)/24 = -3/4\n\nSo 2b = -3/4 --> b = -3/8\n\nNow, substitute b back into equation 6: (-3/8) + c = -19/24\n\nSolving for c: c = -19/24 + 3/8\n\nConvert 3/8 to 9/24:\n\nc = -19/24 + 9/24 = (-10)/24 = -5/12\n\nSo, c = -5/12\n\nSo now I have a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12.\n\nLet me just check if these satisfy equation 3.\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nPlug in a, b, c:\n\n-(-7/24) - (-3/8) + (-5/12) = ?\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-(-7/24) = 7/24\n\n-(-3/8) = 3/8 = 9/24\n\n+ (-5/12) = -5/12 = -10/24\n\nSo adding them: 7/24 + 9/24 -10/24 = (7 +9 -10)/24 = 6/24 = 1/4\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12.\n\nNow, the expression we need is |4a + 3b + 2c|.\n\nLet's compute 4a +3b +2c.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n4a = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6\n\n3b = 3*(-3/8) = -9/8\n\n2c = 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6\n\nNow add them together:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nFirst, combine -7/6 and -5/6: (-7 -5)/6 = -12/6 = -2\n\nThen, add -9/8: -2 -9/8 = (-16/8 -9/8) = -25/8\n\nSo, 4a +3b +2c = -25/8\n\nTaking absolute value: | -25/8 | = 25/8\n\nSo the value is 25/8.",

Got that.\n\nNow, let's go back to Eq3: z = 2^(1/4) * x y.\n\nWe can use this to find an expression for x y in terms of z.\n\nSo, rearrange Eq3: x y = z / 2^(1/4) = z * 2^(-1/4).\n\nBut we already know z is 2^(-5/12). So:\n\nx y = 2^(-5/12) * 2^(-1/4) = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3).\n\nSo, x y = 2^(-2/3).\n\nLet me note that down: x y = 2^(-2/3). Let's call this Eq4.\n\nNow, let's go back to Eq1: x = 2^(1/2) * y z.\n\nWe can plug z = 2^(-5/12) into this.\n\nx = 2^(1/2) * y * 2^(-5/12) = y * 2^(1/2 - 5/12) = y * 2^( (6/12 - 5/12) ) = y * 2^(1/12).\n\nSo, x = y * 2^(1/12). Let's call this Eq5.\n\nNow, from Eq5, x is expressed in terms of y. Let's substitute this into Eq4.\n\nFrom Eq4: x y = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSubstitute x = y * 2^(1/12):\n\n(y * 2^(1/12)) * y = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSo, y\u00b2 * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nDivide both sides by 2^(1/12):\n\ny\u00b2 = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3 - 1/12) = 2^(-8/12 - 1/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4)\n\nTherefore, y\u00b2 = 2^(-3/4), so y = 2^(-3/8). Since y is positive.\n\nSo, y = 2^(-3/8).\n\nNow, from Eq5, x = y * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8 + 1/12)\n\nLet me compute the exponents: -3/8 is -9/24, and 1/12 is 2/24. So, adding those gives (-9 + 2)/24 = -7/24.\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24).\n\nSo, now I have x, y, z:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\ny = 2^(-3/8)\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nLet me verify these with the original equations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst equation: log\u2082(x/(y z))\n\nCompute x/(y z):\n\nx = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24), z = 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24)\n\nSo, y z = 2^(-9/24) * 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-19/24)\n\nx/(y z) = [2^(-7/24)] / [2^(-19/24)] = 2^(-7/24 + 19/24) = 2^(12/24) = 2^(1/2) = sqrt(2)\n\nlog\u2082(sqrt(2)) = 1/2, which matches the first equation. Good.\n\nSecond equation: log\u2082(y/(x z)).\n\nCompute y/(x z):\n\ny = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24)\nx z = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-17/24)\nSo, y/(x z) = 2^(-9/24) / 2^(-17/24) = 2^(8/24) = 2^(1/3), which is correct, log\u2082(2^(1/3)) = 1/3.\n\nThird equation: log\u2082(z/(x y)).\n\nCompute z/(x y):\n\nz = 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24)\nx y = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-16/24) = 2^(-2/3)\nSo, z/(x y) = [2^(-10/24)] / [2^(-16/24)] = 2^(6/24) = 2^(1/4). So, log\u2082(2^(1/4)) = 1/4. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the values of x, y, z are correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks for |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|.\n\nLet me compute this expression.\n\nFirst, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = 4 log\u2082 x + 3 log\u2082 y + 2 log\u2082 z.\n\nSince logs turn exponents into multipliers.\n\nSo, let's compute each term:\n\nlog\u2082 x = log\u2082 (2^(-7/24)) = -7/24\n\nlog\u2082 y = log\u2082 (2^(-3/8)) = -3/8\n\nlog\u2082 z = log\u2082 (2^(-5/12)) = -5/12\n\nSo, plug these into the expression:\n\n4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12)\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = (-7)/6\n\n3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8\n\n2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6\n\nNow, sum these together:\n\n(-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)\n\nFirst, let's find a common denominator.

Let's compute x*y:\n\nx*y = [2^(-7/24)] * [2^(-3/8)] = 2^(-7/24 -9/24) = 2^(-16/24)= 2^(-2/3). Multiply by 2^(1/4)=2^(6/24):\n\nSo, 2^(-2/3 + 1/4)= 2^(-8/12 +3/12)= 2^(-5/12). Which is z. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the exponents are correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to compute log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2). Let's compute x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2:\n\nx^4 = [2^(-7/24)]^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6)\n\ny^3 = [2^(-3/8)]^3 = 2^(-9/8)\n\nz^2 = [2^(-5/12)]^2 = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nMultiplying these together:\n\nx^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6) = 2^(-7/6 -9/8 -5/6)\n\nLet me compute the exponents:\n\nConvert all to 24 denominators.\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n-9/8 = -27/24\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nAdding them: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8.\n\nSo, x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2 = 2^(-25/8). Then log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) is log\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.\n\nBut the problem asks for the absolute value, so | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo, the value is 25/8, which is m/n where m=25 and n=8. They are coprime since 25 and 8 share no common factors besides 1.\n\nSo, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.",

Now, let's find another variable. Let's take equation (2a): -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nWe know a is -7/24. Plugging that in:\n\n-(-7/24) + b - c = 1/3 \u2192 7/24 + b - c = 1/3\n\nCompute 1/3 as 8/24:\n\n7/24 + b - c = 8/24 \u2192 b - c = 8/24 -7/24 = 1/24 \u2192 Equation (5a): b - c = 1/24\n\nSimilarly, let's take equation (3a): -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nAgain, a is -7/24:\n\n-(-7/24) - b + c = 1/4 \u2192 7/24 - b + c = 1/4\n\nConvert 1/4 to 6/24:\n\n7/24 - b + c = 6/24 \u2192 -b + c = 6/24 -7/24 = -1/24 \u2192 Equation (6a): -b + c = -1/24\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n(5a): b - c = 1/24\n\n(6a): -b + c = -1/24\n\nLet me write them together:\n\n1. b - c = 1/24\n\n2. -b + c = -1/24\n\nHmm, if I add these two equations together:\n\n(b - c) + (-b + c) = 1/24 + (-1/24)\n\nLeft side: 0 = 0\n\nRight side: 0\n\nSo, the equations are dependent, which makes sense because we have three equations and are solving for three variables, but after substitution, some may become dependent.\n\nSo, let me pick one equation to solve for one variable. Let's take equation (5a): b - c = 1/24 \u2192 b = c + 1/24\n\nNow, let's plug this into equation (4a): a + b + c = -13/12\n\nWe have a = -7/24, and b = c + 1/24.\n\nSo,\n\n-7/24 + (c + 1/24) + c = -13/12\n\nSimplify:\n\n-7/24 + c + 1/24 + c = -13/12\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-7/24 + 1/24) + 2c = -13/12\n\n(-6/24) + 2c = -13/12\n\nSimplify -6/24 to -1/4:\n\n-1/4 + 2c = -13/12\n\nNow, let's solve for c:\n\n2c = -13/12 + 1/4\n\nConvert 1/4 to 3/12:\n\n2c = -13/12 + 3/12 = (-13 + 3)/12 = (-10)/12 = -5/6\n\nSo, 2c = -5/6 \u2192 c = (-5/6)/2 = -5/12\n\nSo, c = -5/12\n\nNow, from equation (5a): b = c + 1/24\n\nc is -5/12, which is -10/24.\n\nSo, b = (-10/24) + 1/24 = (-9)/24 = -3/8\n\nThus, b = -3/8\n\nSo, to recap:\n\na = -7/24\n\nb = -3/8\n\nc = -5/12\n\nNow, let's check if these satisfy the original equations to avoid mistakes.\n\nCheck equation (1a): a - b - c = (-7/24) - (-3/8) - (-5/12)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-7/24\n\n- (-3/8) = +3/8 = 9/24\n\n- (-5/12) = +5/12 = 10/24\n\nSo, sum: (-7 + 9 + 10)/24 = 12/24 = 1/2 \u2192 Correct, matches equation (1a)\n\nCheck equation (2a): -a + b - c = -(-7/24) + (-3/8) - (-5/12)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n7/24\n\n-3/8 = -9/24\n\n5/12 = 10/24\n\nSum: 7 -9 +10 =8 \u2192 8/24 = 1/3 \u2192 Correct, matches equation (2a)\n\nCheck equation (3a): -a - b + c = -(-7/24) - (-3/8) + (-5/12)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n7/24\n\n- (-3/8) = +3/8 = 9/24\n\n-5/12 = -10/24\n\nSum: 7 +9 -10 =6 \u2192 6/24 = 1/4 \u2192 Correct, matches equation (3a)\n\nSo, all equations are satisfied. Good.\n\nNow, the question is to find |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|.\n\nWhich is |4a + 3b + 2c|\n\nSince a, b, c are exponents in log\u2082(x), etc., so x = 2^a, y=2^b, z=2^c.\n\nSo, x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = (2^a)^4 * (2^b)^3 * (2^c)^2 = 2^{4a + 3b + 2c}\n\nThus, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = 4a +3b +2c\n\nSo, let's compute 4a +3b +2c with a= -7/24, b= -3/8, c= -5/12.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n4a = 4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = (-7)/6 \u2248 -1.1667\n\n3b = 3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8 \u2248 -1.125\n\n2c = 2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6 \u2248 -0.8333\n\nNow, sum them up:\n\n(-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)\n\nLet me convert all to 24 denominators.\n\n-7/6 = (-28)/24\n\n-9/8 = (-27)/24\n\n-5/6 = (-20)/24\n\nSum: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24\n\nSimplify: -75/24 = -25/8",

To add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 2, 3, 4. The least common denominator is 12.\n\nSo converting each:\n\n1/2 = 6/12\n\n1/3 = 4/12\n\n1/4 = 3/12\n\nAdding them together: 6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12 = 13/12.\n\nSo the product of the right-hand sides is 2^(13/12).\n\nPutting it all together: 1/(x y z) = 2^(13/12), so x y z = 1 / 2^(13/12) = 2^(-13/12).\n\nThat's a useful equation. So x y z = 2^(-13/12).\n\nNow, I need to find log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2). Let's express that as log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = log\u2082(x^4) + log\u2082(y^3) + log\u2082(z^2) = 4 log\u2082 x + 3 log\u2082 y + 2 log\u2082 z.\n\nSo, if I can find log\u2082 x, log\u2082 y, and log\u2082 z, I can compute this expression.",

Let me convert all fractions to 24 denominator.\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8 = -27/24\n\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nSo total exponent: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8.\n\nSo x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-25/8).\n\nThen, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = log\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.\n\nTaking absolute value: | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo the value is 25/8. Since 25 and 8 are coprime, m =25 and n=8, so m +n=33.",

So 13/12.\n\nSo, -a - b - c = 13/12 --> a + b + c = -13/12\n\nLet me note that as equation 4: a + b + c = -13/12\n\nNow, I can use equations 1, 2, 3 with equation 4.\n\nFrom equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2\n\nEquation 4: a + b + c = -13/12\n\nIf I add equation 1 and equation 4:\n\n(a - b - c) + (a + b + c) = 1/2 + (-13/12)\n\nLeft side: 2a\n\nRight side: 6/12 -13/12 = (-7)/12\n\nSo 2a = -7/12 --> a = (-7)/24\n\nHmm, so a is -7/24.\n\nSimilarly, let's subtract equation 1 from equation 4:\n\n(a + b + c) - (a - b - c) = (-13/12) - (1/2)\n\nLeft side: 2b + 2c\n\nRight side: -13/12 -6/12 = -19/12\n\nSo, 2(b + c) = -19/12 --> b + c = -19/24\n\nHmm, keep that aside.\n\nNow, let me take equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nWe know a = -7/24, so plug that in:\n\n-(-7/24) + b - c = 1/3 --> 7/24 + b - c = 1/3\n\nConvert 1/3 to 8/24:\n\n7/24 + b - c = 8/24 --> b - c = 1/24\n\nSo equation 5: b - c = 1/24\n\nEarlier, we have:\n\nb + c = -19/24 (from subtracting equation 1 from equation 4)\n\nSo now, we have two equations in b and c:\n\nEquation 5: b - c = 1/24\n\nEquation 6: b + c = -19/24\n\nLet me add these two equations:\n\n(b - c) + (b + c) = 1/24 + (-19/24)\n\nLeft side: 2b\n\nRight side: (-18)/24 = -3/4\n\nSo 2b = -3/4 --> b = -3/8\n\nNow, substitute b back into equation 6: (-3/8) + c = -19/24\n\nSolving for c: c = -19/24 + 3/8\n\nConvert 3/8 to 9/24:\n\nc = -19/24 + 9/24 = (-10)/24 = -5/12\n\nSo, c = -5/12\n\nSo now I have a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12.\n\nLet me just check if these satisfy equation 3.\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nPlug in a, b, c:\n\n-(-7/24) - (-3/8) + (-5/12) = ?\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-(-7/24) = 7/24\n\n-(-3/8) = 3/8 = 9/24\n\n+ (-5/12) = -5/12 = -10/24\n\nSo adding them: 7/24 + 9/24 -10/24 = (7 +9 -10)/24 = 6/24 = 1/4\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12.\n\nNow, the expression we need is |4a + 3b + 2c|.\n\nLet's compute 4a +3b +2c.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n4a = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6\n\n3b = 3*(-3/8) = -9/8\n\n2c = 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6\n\nNow add them together:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nFirst, combine -7/6 and -5/6: (-7 -5)/6 = -12/6 = -2\n\nThen, add -9/8: -2 -9/8 = (-16/8 -9/8) = -25/8\n\nSo, 4a +3b +2c = -25/8\n\nTaking absolute value: | -25/8 | = 25/8\n\nSo the value is 25/8.",

Got that.\n\nNow, let's go back to Eq3: z = 2^(1/4) * x y.\n\nWe can use this to find an expression for x y in terms of z.\n\nSo, rearrange Eq3: x y = z / 2^(1/4) = z * 2^(-1/4).\n\nBut we already know z is 2^(-5/12). So:\n\nx y = 2^(-5/12) * 2^(-1/4) = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3).\n\nSo, x y = 2^(-2/3).\n\nLet me note that down: x y = 2^(-2/3). Let's call this Eq4.\n\nNow, let's go back to Eq1: x = 2^(1/2) * y z.\n\nWe can plug z = 2^(-5/12) into this.\n\nx = 2^(1/2) * y * 2^(-5/12) = y * 2^(1/2 - 5/12) = y * 2^( (6/12 - 5/12) ) = y * 2^(1/12).\n\nSo, x = y * 2^(1/12). Let's call this Eq5.\n\nNow, from Eq5, x is expressed in terms of y. Let's substitute this into Eq4.\n\nFrom Eq4: x y = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSubstitute x = y * 2^(1/12):\n\n(y * 2^(1/12)) * y = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSo, y\u00b2 * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nDivide both sides by 2^(1/12):\n\ny\u00b2 = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3 - 1/12) = 2^(-8/12 - 1/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4)\n\nTherefore, y\u00b2 = 2^(-3/4), so y = 2^(-3/8). Since y is positive.\n\nSo, y = 2^(-3/8).\n\nNow, from Eq5, x = y * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8 + 1/12)\n\nLet me compute the exponents: -3/8 is -9/24, and 1/12 is 2/24. So, adding those gives (-9 + 2)/24 = -7/24.\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24).\n\nSo, now I have x, y, z:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\ny = 2^(-3/8)\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nLet me verify these with the original equations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst equation: log\u2082(x/(y z))\n\nCompute x/(y z):\n\nx = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24), z = 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24)\n\nSo, y z = 2^(-9/24) * 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-19/24)\n\nx/(y z) = [2^(-7/24)] / [2^(-19/24)] = 2^(-7/24 + 19/24) = 2^(12/24) = 2^(1/2) = sqrt(2)\n\nlog\u2082(sqrt(2)) = 1/2, which matches the first equation. Good.\n\nSecond equation: log\u2082(y/(x z)).\n\nCompute y/(x z):\n\ny = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24)\nx z = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-17/24)\nSo, y/(x z) = 2^(-9/24) / 2^(-17/24) = 2^(8/24) = 2^(1/3), which is correct, log\u2082(2^(1/3)) = 1/3.\n\nThird equation: log\u2082(z/(x y)).\n\nCompute z/(x y):\n\nz = 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24)\nx y = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-16/24) = 2^(-2/3)\nSo, z/(x y) = [2^(-10/24)] / [2^(-16/24)] = 2^(6/24) = 2^(1/4). So, log\u2082(2^(1/4)) = 1/4. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the values of x, y, z are correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks for |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|.\n\nLet me compute this expression.\n\nFirst, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = 4 log\u2082 x + 3 log\u2082 y + 2 log\u2082 z.\n\nSince logs turn exponents into multipliers.\n\nSo, let's compute each term:\n\nlog\u2082 x = log\u2082 (2^(-7/24)) = -7/24\n\nlog\u2082 y = log\u2082 (2^(-3/8)) = -3/8\n\nlog\u2082 z = log\u2082 (2^(-5/12)) = -5/12\n\nSo, plug these into the expression:\n\n4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12)\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = (-7)/6\n\n3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8\n\n2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6\n\nNow, sum these together:\n\n(-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)\n\nFirst, let's find a common denominator.

Let's compute x*y:\n\nx*y = [2^(-7/24)] * [2^(-3/8)] = 2^(-7/24 -9/24) = 2^(-16/24)= 2^(-2/3). Multiply by 2^(1/4)=2^(6/24):\n\nSo, 2^(-2/3 + 1/4)= 2^(-8/12 +3/12)= 2^(-5/12). Which is z. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the exponents are correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to compute log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2). Let's compute x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2:\n\nx^4 = [2^(-7/24)]^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6)\n\ny^3 = [2^(-3/8)]^3 = 2^(-9/8)\n\nz^2 = [2^(-5/12)]^2 = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nMultiplying these together:\n\nx^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6) = 2^(-7/6 -9/8 -5/6)\n\nLet me compute the exponents:\n\nConvert all to 24 denominators.\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n-9/8 = -27/24\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nAdding them: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8.\n\nSo, x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2 = 2^(-25/8). Then log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) is log\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.\n\nBut the problem asks for the absolute value, so | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo, the value is 25/8, which is m/n where m=25 and n=8. They are coprime since 25 and 8 share no common factors besides 1.\n\nSo, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.",

Let's take equation (5a): b - c = 1/24 \u2192 b = c + 1/24\n\nNow, let's plug this into equation (4a): a + b + c = -13/12\n\nWe have a = -7/24, and b = c + 1/24.\n\nSo,\n\n-7/24 + (c + 1/24) + c = -13/12\n\nSimplify:\n\n-7/24 + c + 1/24 + c = -13/12\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-7/24 + 1/24) + 2c = -13/12\n\n(-6/24) + 2c = -13/12\n\nSimplify -6/24 to -1/4:\n\n-1/4 + 2c = -13/12\n\nNow, let's solve for c:\n\n2c = -13/12 + 1/4\n\nConvert 1/4 to 3/12:\n\n2c = -13/12 + 3/12 = (-13 + 3)/12 = (-10)/12 = -5/6\n\nSo, 2c = -5/6 \u2192 c = (-5/6)/2 = -5/12\n\nSo, c = -5/12\n\nNow, from equation (5a): b = c + 1/24\n\nc is -5/12, which is -10/24.\n\nSo, b = (-10/24) + 1/24 = (-9)/24 = -3/8\n\nThus, b = -3/8\n\nSo, to recap:\n\na = -7/24\n\nb = -3/8\n\nc = -5/12\n\nNow, let's check if these satisfy the original equations to avoid mistakes.\n\nCheck equation (1a): a - b - c = (-7/24) - (-3/8) - (-5/12)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-7/24\n\n- (-3/8) = +3/8 = 9/24\n\n- (-5/12) = +5/12 = 10/24\n\nSo, sum: (-7 + 9 + 10)/24 = 12/24 = 1/2 \u2192 Correct, matches equation (1a)\n\nCheck equation (2a): -a + b - c = -(-7/24) + (-3/8) - (-5/12)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n7/24\n\n-3/8 = -9/24\n\n5/12 = 10/24\n\nSum: 7 -9 +10 =8 \u2192 8/24 = 1/3 \u2192 Correct, matches equation (2a)\n\nCheck equation (3a): -a - b + c = -(-7/24) - (-3/8) + (-5/12)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n7/24\n\n- (-3/8) = +3/8 = 9/24\n\n-5/12 = -10/24\n\nSum: 7 +9 -10 =6 \u2192 6/24 = 1/4 \u2192 Correct, matches equation (3a)\n\nSo, all equations are satisfied. Good.\n\nNow, the question is to find |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|.\n\nWhich is |4a + 3b + 2c|\n\nSince a, b, c are exponents in log\u2082(x), etc., so x = 2^a, y=2^b, z=2^c.\n\nSo, x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = (2^a)^4 * (2^b)^3 * (2^c)^2 = 2^{4a + 3b + 2c}\n\nThus, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = 4a +3b +2c\n\nSo, let's compute 4a +3b +2c with a= -7/24, b= -3/8, c= -5/12.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n4a = 4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = (-7)/6 \u2248 -1.1667\n\n3b = 3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8 \u2248 -1.125\n\n2c = 2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6 \u2248 -0.8333\n\nNow, sum them up:\n\n(-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)\n\nLet me convert all to 24 denominators.\n\n-7/6 = (-28)/24\n\n-9/8 = (-27)/24\n\n-5/6 = (-20)/24\n\nSum: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24\n\nSimplify: -75/24 = -25/8",

To add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 2, 3, 4.

So x y z = 2^(-13/12).\n\nNow, I need to find log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2). Let's express that as log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = log\u2082(x^4) + log\u2082(y^3) + log\u2082(z^2) = 4 log\u2082 x + 3 log\u2082 y + 2 log\u2082 z.\n\nSo, if I can find log\u2082 x, log\u2082 y, and log\u2082 z, I can compute this expression.",

So total exponent is (-9 + 2)/24 = -7/24\n\nSo x = 2^(-7/24)\n\nLet me recap the values I have:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\ny = 2^(-3/8)\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nNow, I need to compute log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)\n\nWhich is log\u2082( (2^(-7/24))^4 * (2^(-3/8))^3 * (2^(-5/12))^2 )\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n(2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-7/24 *4) = 2^(-7/6)\n(2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8)\n(2^(-5/12))^2 = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nMultiply them together: 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6) = 2^(-7/6 -9/8 -5/6)\n\nCompute the exponent:\n\nLet's find a common denominator for 6, 8, 6. The least common multiple is 24.\n\nConvert each fraction:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n-9/8 = -27/24\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nAdd them together: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24\n\nSimplify: -75/24 can be reduced. Divide numerator and denominator by 3: -25/8\n\nSo the exponent is -25/8, so the product is 2^(-25/8)\n\nTherefore, log\u2082( x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 ) = log\u2082( 2^(-25/8) ) = -25/8\n\nTaking the absolute value: | -25/8 | = 25/8\n\nSo m is 25, n is 8. They are coprime.\n\nThus, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33",

So, -10/24 + 1/24 = -9/24 = -3/8.\n\nSo y = 2^(-3/8).\n\nSo now, we have:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-3/8), z = 2^(-5/12).\n\nLet me verify these values with equation 1 to make sure.\n\nEquation 1: log\u2082(x/(y z)) = 1/2.\n\nCompute x/(y z) = [2^(-7/24)] / [2^(-3/8) * 2^(-5/12)].\n\nLet me add the exponents in the denominator:\n\n-3/8 + (-5/12) = -3/8 -5/12.

Let me convert all fractions to 24 denominator.\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8 = -27/24\n\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nSo total exponent: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8.\n\nSo x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-25/8).\n\nThen, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = log\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.\n\nTaking absolute value: | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo the value is 25/8. Since 25 and 8 are coprime, m =25 and n=8, so m +n=33.",

So in terms of a, b, c: a - b - c = 1/2 ...(1)\n\nSimilarly, the second equation: log\u2082(y/(xz)) = 1/3. Which is log\u2082y - log\u2082x - log\u2082z = 1/3. So, b - a - c = 1/3 ...(2)\n\nThird equation: log\u2082(z/(xy)) = 1/4. So log\u2082z - log\u2082x - log\u2082y = 1/4. Which is c - a - b = 1/4 ...(3)\n\nSo now I have a system of linear equations:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nHmm, let me write these equations clearly:\n\nEquation 1: a - b - c = 1/2\n\nEquation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nI need to solve for a, b, c. Let's see if I can solve this system.\n\nMaybe I can add all three equations together to see if something cancels.\n\nAdding equation 1, equation 2, equation 3:\n\n(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4\n\nLet me compute the left side:\n\na - b - c - a + b - c - a - b + c\n\nLet me collect like terms:\n\na: a -a -a = -a\n\nb: -b + b - b = -b\n\nc: -c - c + c = -c\n\nSo the left side simplifies to -a - b - c.\n\nThe right side: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4.

So, 2^{5/6}.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\ny = y * z\u00b2 * 2^{5/6}\n\nHmm, I can divide both sides by y (since y is positive, we can do that):\n\n1 = z\u00b2 * 2^{5/6}\n\nSo, z\u00b2 = 1 / (2^{5/6}) = 2^{-5/6}\n\nTaking square root,\n\nz = 2^{-5/12}  (since z is positive, we take the positive root)\n\nOkay, so now I know z in terms of exponents. Let me note that:\n\nz = 2^{-5/12}\n\nAlright, moving on. Now, perhaps I can substitute z back into another equation to find x or y. Let's try substituting z into equation (1) to find x in terms of y.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\nx = y z sqrt(2) = y * (2^{-5/12}) * 2^{1/2}\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\n2^{-5/12} * 2^{1/2} = 2^{-5/12 + 6/12} = 2^{1/12}\n\nSo, x = y * 2^{1/12}",
          "text2": "Wait, but then I can write this as y = 2^(5/6) y z\u00b2.\n\nHmm, so if I divide both sides by y (since y is positive, it can't be zero), I get 1 = 2^(5/6) z\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, z\u00b2 = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6).\n\nTaking square roots, z = 2^(-5/12). Because sqrt(2^(-5/6)) = 2^(-5/12). Since z is positive, we take the positive root.\n\nSo, z = 2^(-5/12). Got it.\n\nNow, let's find z in terms of exponents of 2. So, z = 2^(-5/12).\n\nNext, maybe I can find x and y. Let's go back to the first equation: x = sqrt(2) y z.\n\nBut I can also substitute z into this equation. Let me express sqrt(2) as 2^(1/2), and z is 2^(-5/12), so let's compute x in terms of y.\n\nx = 2^(1/2) * y * 2^(-5/12) = y * 2^(1/2 - 5/12).\n\nCompute the exponent: 1/2 is 6/12, so 6/12 - 5/12 = 1/12.\n\nSo, x = y * 2^(1/12). So x = y * 2^(1/12).\n\nNow, let's use the third equation to find another relationship. The third equation was z = x y * 2^(1/4).\n\nBut we know z is 2^(-5/12), so:\n\n2^(-5/12) = x y * 2^(1/4).\n\nBut we already have x = y * 2^(1/12). So substitute that:\n\n2^(-5/12) = (y * 2^(1/12)) * y * 2^(1/4).\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n(y * y) = y\u00b2.\n\nAnd 2^(1/12) * 2^(1/4) = 2^(1/12 + 3/12) = 2^(4/12) = 2^(1/3).\n\nSo, 2^(-5/12) = y\u00b2 * 2^(1/3).\n\nLet me solve for y\u00b2:\n\ny\u00b2 = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/3) = 2^(-5/12 - 4/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4).\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = 2^(-3/4). Therefore, y = 2^(-3/8), since y is positive.\n\nSo, y = 2^(-3/8).\n\nNow, we can find x from x = y * 2^(1/12).\n\nSubstituting y = 2^(-3/8):\n\nx = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8 + 1/12).\n\nCompute the exponent: -3/8 is -9/24, 1/12 is 2/24. So adding, -9/24 + 2/24 = -7/24.\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24).\n\nLet me summarize the values I have so far:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\ny = 2^(-3/8)\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nNow, I need to compute |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|.\n\nLet me compute the exponent part first: x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2.\n\nExpressed in terms of powers of 2, each variable is already a power of 2, so raising them to exponents will multiply the exponents.\n\nSo, x\u2074 = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-7/24 * 4) = 2^(-7/6)\n\nSimilarly, y\u00b3 = (2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8)\n\nz\u00b2 = (2^(-5/12))^2 = 2^(-5/6)\n\nMultiplying them together:\n\nx\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6) = 2^(-7/6 -9/8 -5/6)\n\nLet me compute the exponents:\n\nFirst, find a common denominator. The denominators are 6, 8, 6. The least common multiple is 24.\n\nConvert each fraction:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8 = -27/24\n\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nAdding them: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24\n\nSimplify -75/24: divide numerator and denominator by 3: -25/8.\n\nSo, x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-25/8).\n\nTherefore, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = log\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.\n\nTaking the absolute value: | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo the value is 25/8. The problem says m and n are coprime positive integers, so 25 and 8 share no common factors besides 1. Thus, m =25, n=8, so m +n=33.",

So, total exponent is (-8 -1)/12 = -9/12 = -3/4.\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = 2^(-3/4). Therefore, y = 2^(-3/8), since square root of 2^(-3/4) is 2^(-3/8).\n\nSo, y = 2^(-3/8). Now, from equation (5), x = y * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8 + 1/12).\n\nLet me compute the exponent: -3/8 is -9/24, and 1/12 is 2/24. So, total is (-9 + 2)/24 = (-7)/24.\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24).\n\nNow, let me summarize:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\ny = 2^(-3/8)\nz = 2^(-5/12)",

Substituting y and z:\n\nx = [2^(-3/8)] * [2^(-5/12)] * 2^(1/2).\n\nLet's compute exponents:\n\n-3/8 is -9/24, -5/12 is -10/24, 1/2 is 12/24.\n\nAdding them: (-9 -10 +12)/24 = (-7)/24. So, x is 2^(-7/24). That matches.\n\nSimilarly, equation (2): y = x z * 2^(1/3). Let's compute x * z:\n\nx*z = [2^(-7/24)] * [2^(-5/12)] = 2^(-7/24 -10/24) = 2^(-17/24). Multiply by 2^(1/3) which is 2^(8/24):\n\nSo, 2^(-17/24 + 8/24)= 2^(-9/24)= 2^(-3/8). Which is y. Correct.\n\nEquation (3): z = x y * 2^(1/4). Let's compute x*y:\n\nx*y = [2^(-7/24)] * [2^(-3/8)] = 2^(-7/24 -9/24) = 2^(-16/24)= 2^(-2/3). Multiply by 2^(1/4)=2^(6/24):\n\nSo, 2^(-2/3 + 1/4)= 2^(-8/12 +3/12)= 2^(-5/12). Which is z. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the exponents are correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to compute log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2). Let's compute x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2:\n\nx^4 = [2^(-7/24)]^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6)\n\ny^3 = [2^(-3/8)]^3 = 2^(-9/8)\n\nz^2 = [2^(-5/12)]^2 = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nMultiplying these together:\n\nx^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6) = 2^(-7/6 -9/8 -5/6)\n\nLet me compute the exponents:\n\nConvert all to 24 denominators.\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n-9/8 = -27/24\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nAdding them: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8.\n\nSo, x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2 = 2^(-25/8). Then log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) is log\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.\n\nBut the problem asks for the absolute value, so | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo, the value is 25/8, which is m/n where m=25 and n=8. They are coprime since 25 and 8 share no common factors besides 1.\n\nSo, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.",

But I also have equation 1: x = y z * 2^(1/2).

Let's call this Equation 5.\n\nNow, we have Equations 4 and 5:\n\nEquation 4: a - b = 1/12  \nEquation 5: -a + b = -1/12\n\nHmm, let's add Equation 4 and Equation 5:\n\n(a - a) + (-b + b) = 1/12 -1/12  \n0 = 0. Hmm, that's not helpful. Maybe solve one equation for a variable and substitute.\n\nFrom Equation 4: a = b + 1/12\n\nPlug into Equation 5: -(b + 1/12) + b = -1/12  \nSimplify: -b -1/12 + b = -1/12  \nWhich gives: -1/12 = -1/12.

So, I found z in terms of exponents of 2. That might help.\n\nNow, let me note that z = 2^(-5/12).\n\nNow, let's go back to equation (3): z = xy * 2^(1/4). Since I know z, I can write:\n\n2^(-5/12) = x y * 2^(1/4)\n\nSo, x y = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/4) = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) because 1/4 is 3/12. So, -5/12 -3/12 = -8/12 = -2/3.\n\nSo, x y = 2^(-2/3). Let me write that as equation (4): x y = 2^(-2/3).\n\nAlso, from equation (1): x = y z sqrt(2). Since z is known, let's plug that in.\n\nz is 2^(-5/12). So, x = y * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/2). Because sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2). So, 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/2) = 2^( (-5/12) + 6/12 ) = 2^(1/12).\n\nSo, x = y * 2^(1/12).\n\nSo, equation (5): x = y * 2^(1/12)\n\nNow, from equation (4): x y = 2^(-2/3). Substitute x from equation (5):\n\n(y * 2^(1/12)) * y = 2^(-2/3)\n\nWhich is y\u00b2 * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3 - 1/12) = let's convert to twelfths.\n\n-2/3 is -8/12, and -1/12 is -1/12. So, total exponent is (-8 -1)/12 = -9/12 = -3/4.\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = 2^(-3/4). Therefore, y = 2^(-3/8), since square root of 2^(-3/4) is 2^(-3/8).\n\nSo, y = 2^(-3/8). Now, from equation (5), x = y * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8 + 1/12).\n\nLet me compute the exponent: -3/8 is -9/24, and 1/12 is 2/24.

So adding exponents:\n\n-9/24 + 2/24 = (-7)/24.\n\nYes, so x = 2^(-7/24).\n\nSo now, we have:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24),\ny = 2^(-3/8),\nz = 2^(-5/12).\n\nLet me write all exponents with denominator 24 to make it easier:\n\n-7/24,\n-3/8 = -9/24,\n-5/12 = -10/24.\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24),\ny = 2^(-9/24),\nz = 2^(-10/24).\n\nHmm, okay. Now, the problem asks for |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|.\n\nFirst, let's compute x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2. Since each variable is a power of 2, we can write this product as a single power of 2.\n\nCompute the exponents:\n\nx\u2074: (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6),\ny\u00b3: (2^(-9/24))^3 = 2^(-27/24) = 2^(-9/8),\nz\u00b2: (2^(-10/24))^2 = 2^(-20/24) = 2^(-5/6).\n\nNow, multiplying these together:\n\nx\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6).\n\nAdd the exponents:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6.\n\nLet me compute that. Let's find a common denominator, which is 24.\n\n-7/6 = -28/24,\n-9/8 = -27/24,\n-5/6 = -20/24.\n\nAdding them: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24.\n\nSimplify: -75/24. Let's see if this reduces.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3: 75 \u00f7 3 =25, 24 \u00f7 3=8. So, -25/8.\n\nSo, x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-25/8).\n\nThus, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = log\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.\n\nThe absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo, the value is 25/8, which is already in lowest terms because 25 and 8 share no common divisors except 1.\n\nTherefore, m =25, n=8, and m +n= 33.",
