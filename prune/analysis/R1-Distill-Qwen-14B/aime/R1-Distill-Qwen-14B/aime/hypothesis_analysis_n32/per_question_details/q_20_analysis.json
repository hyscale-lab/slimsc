For example, suppose row i is W, and column j is B. Then cell (i,j) is empty. So, adding a chip there would require that the entire row i be W, but column j is B, causing a conflict.\n\nSo, in this case, the assignment of row and column colors must be such that for every empty cell (i,j), row i and column j are assigned different colors. And for every non-empty cell (i,j), row i and column j are assigned the same color.\n\nAdditionally, the grid must be such that all non-empty cells are filled with the corresponding color.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting the number of assignments of rows and columns to W, B, or E, such that:\n\n- For every non-empty cell (i,j), row i and column j have the same color (either W or B).\n\n- For every empty cell (i,j), row i and column j have different colors (one is W, the other is B).",

But if a column is white, then all the rows in R that are black would cause a conflict because the cell (i,j) would have to be both white (because column is white) and black (because row is black). So, that's impossible. Therefore, R cannot contain both white and black rows if C is non-empty.\n\nSimilarly, C cannot contain both white and black columns if R is non-empty.\n\nTherefore, the only possibilities are:\n\n- R is non-empty, all rows in R are white, and all columns in C are white.\n\n- R is non-empty, all rows in R are black, and all columns in C are black.\n\nOR\n\n- R is empty, meaning no rows are colored. Then, to satisfy the maximal condition, all columns must be colored. But if all columns are colored, then every cell in the grid is in a column that's colored, so all cells must be black or white, but since rows are uncolored, adding a chip anywhere would require coloring the row, but the column is already colored. Hmm, this is getting too complicated.\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nCase 1: All rows are colored.\n\nSubcase 1a: All rows are white.\n\nThen, each column must be white because every column intersects a white row, and all columns must be white or empty. But if a column is empty, then you could add a white chip in that column without violating the row constraints, which would make the arrangement non-maximal. Therefore, all columns must be white as well. So, the entire grid is white. But then, we have 25 white chips, but the problem says we have 25 white and 25 black chips. So, this is a possible arrangement, but it only uses white chips, leaving all black chips unused. But the problem allows for \"some\" of the chips to be placed, so this is acceptable, but in this case, we're using only white chips.\n\nSimilarly, Subcase 1b: All rows are black. Then, all columns must be black, leading to an all-black grid, using only black chips.\n\nCase 2: Not all rows are colored.\n\nThen, there exists at least one row that's uncolored. For the arrangement to be maximal, every cell in that uncolored row must be in a colored column. Because if there's a cell in an uncolored row and an uncolored column, you could add a chip there without violating the color constraints, which would make the arrangement non-maximal.\n\nTherefore, the uncolored rows must have all their cells in colored columns.

Because otherwise, you could add a chip to an empty cell in those regions without violating the row or column color conditions.\n\nSo, for the arrangement to be maximal, every cell in R_W \u2229 C_W must have a W chip, and every cell in R_B \u2229 C_B must have a B chip.

So, in the case where the grid is full (all white or all black), that's acceptable because you can't add any more chips.

Because if there's a cell in an uncolored row and an uncolored column, you could add a chip there without violating the color constraints, which would make the arrangement non-maximal.\n\nTherefore, the uncolored rows must have all their cells in colored columns.

Otherwise, if a column is in C_black, the cells in that row and column would have to be empty, because row is white and column is black.\n\nSo, the filled cells are W x C_white and B x C_black.\n\nAnd since the arrangement is maximal, we cannot add any more chips. That means that for any row not in W or B, it's empty. Similarly, any column not in C_white or C_black is empty. Also, for any row in W, all columns in C_white must be filled in that row. Otherwise, if a row in W had an empty cell in a column in C_white, you could add a chip there, which would violate the maximal condition.\n\nSo, the arrangement is determined by choosing subsets W of rows, B of rows, C_white of columns, and C_black of columns, such that:\n\n1. W and B are disjoint subsets of rows (since a row can't be both white and black).\n2. C_white and C_black are disjoint subsets of columns.\n3. The intersection of W and B is empty.\n4. The intersection of C_white and C_black is empty.\n5. Additionally, the white region is W x C_white, and black region is B x C_black.

So, for any cell (i,j), if row i is in W or B, and column j is in C_white or C_black, then the cell must be filled if row i and column j are the same color.\n\nThus, the arrangement is determined by choosing:\n\n- A subset of rows W (white), a subset of rows B (black), with W \u2229 B = empty.\n- A subset of columns C_white, a subset of columns C_black, with C_white \u2229 C_black = empty.\n\nThen, the filled cells are W \u00d7 C_white \u222a B \u00d7 C_black.

But if a column is white, then all the rows in R that are black would cause a conflict because the cell (i,j) would have to be both white (because column is white) and black (because row is black). So, that's impossible. Therefore, R cannot contain both white and black rows if C is non-empty.\n\nSimilarly, C cannot contain both white and black columns if R is non-empty.\n\nTherefore, the only possibilities are:\n\n- R is non-empty, all rows in R are white, and all columns in C are white.\n\n- R is non-empty, all rows in R are black, and all columns in C are black.\n\nOR\n\n- R is empty, meaning no rows are colored. Then, to satisfy the maximal condition, all columns must be colored. But if all columns are colored, then every cell in the grid is in a column that's colored, so all cells must be black or white, but since rows are uncolored, adding a chip anywhere would require coloring the row, but the column is already colored. Hmm, this is getting too complicated.\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nCase 1: All rows are colored.\n\nSubcase 1a: All rows are white.\n\nThen, each column must be white because every column intersects a white row, and all columns must be white or empty. But if a column is empty, then you could add a white chip in that column without violating the row constraints, which would make the arrangement non-maximal. Therefore, all columns must be white as well. So, the entire grid is white. But then, we have 25 white chips, but the problem says we have 25 white and 25 black chips. So, this is a possible arrangement, but it only uses white chips, leaving all black chips unused. But the problem allows for \"some\" of the chips to be placed, so this is acceptable, but in this case, we're using only white chips.\n\nSimilarly, Subcase 1b: All rows are black. Then, all columns must be black, leading to an all-black grid, using only black chips.\n\nCase 2: Not all rows are colored.\n\nThen, there exists at least one row that's uncolored. For the arrangement to be maximal, every cell in that uncolored row must be in a colored column. Because if there's a cell in an uncolored row and an uncolored column, you could add a chip there without violating the color constraints, which would make the arrangement non-maximal.\n\nTherefore, the uncolored rows must have all their cells in colored columns. Similarly, the uncolored columns must have all their cells in colored rows.",

Because otherwise, you could add a chip to an empty cell in those regions without violating the row or column color conditions.\n\nSo, for the arrangement to be maximal, every cell in R_W \u2229 C_W must have a W chip, and every cell in R_B \u2229 C_B must have a B chip.

So, (0,0) is a solution, but that would mean all rows are black and all columns are black, so all cells are black. But then, we have 25 black chips, but we have 25 white chips as well. So, perhaps that's a valid case, but in this case, we're placing 25 black chips, using all 25 cells, and no white chips. But the problem allows using some chips.

So, no real solutions, which suggests that there is no such placement where the white and black chips each sum to 25.

However, the problem mentions that there are 25 white and 25 black chips available, but I think it's just stating that these are the quantities available, but the placement can use any number of them as long as the conditions are met.",

So, the current placement is such that for every empty cell, adding a chip there would require that row or column to be of a different color than they currently are, which is not allowed.\n\nWhich means that every empty cell is in a row and a column that are already colored with different colors. Because if a row is white and a column is black, their intersection is empty. So, you can't add a chip there because it would have to be both white and black.",
