They need to be such that opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles, which in the circle would correspond to certain symmetries.\n\nI recall that in a circle, a rectangle is formed when its vertices are equally spaced around the circumference. For example, a square is a special case of a rectangle where each vertex is 90 degrees apart. But in a dodecagon, which is 12-sided, the spacing between vertices is 30 degrees (360/12=30). So, the possible step sizes between vertices would be multiples of 30 degrees, like 30, 60, 90, etc. But for a rectangle, we need four points such that each adjacent pair is separated by a certain number of steps, and the diagonals are equal in length.",

Therefore, in a regular dodecagon, for each step size k (from 1 to 5), the chords with that step size are all parallel to each other.\n\nSo, to form a rectangle, I need two different step sizes, say k and m, such that the sides formed by stepping k and m are perpendicular to each other.",

Let's consider that for two chords to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes must be -1.\n\nBut since all points lie on a unit circle, we can assign coordinates to each vertex.\n\nLet me model the dodecagon on the unit circle. Vertex 0 is at (1, 0). Vertex 1 is at (cos(30\u00b0), sin(30\u00b0)), which is (\u221a3/2, 1/2). Vertex 2 is at (cos(60\u00b0), sin(60\u00b0)) = (1/2, \u221a3/2), and so on.\n\nSo, each vertex k is at (cos(30k\u00b0), sin(30k\u00b0)).\n\nNow, a chord connecting vertex i to vertex j is the vector from point i to point j: (cos(30j\u00b0) - cos(30i\u00b0), sin(30j\u00b0) - sin(30i\u00b0)).\n\nSimilarly, the chord connecting vertex j to vertex k is the vector (cos(30k\u00b0) - cos(30j\u00b0), sin(30k\u00b0) - sin(30j\u00b0)).\n\nFor these two vectors to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero.\n\nSo, the dot product of vectors (i to j) and (j to k) is zero.\n\nSo, [cos(30j\u00b0) - cos(30i\u00b0)][cos(30k\u00b0) - cos(30j\u00b0)] + [sin(30j\u00b0) - sin(30i\u00b0)][sin(30k\u00b0) - sin(30j\u00b0)] = 0.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps we can find a condition on the steps.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the step from i to j as a, and from j to k as b.\n\nSo, step a = j - i mod 12, step b = k - j mod 12.\n\nWe need the vectors (j - i) and (k - j) to be perpendicular.\n\nSo, the vectors are:\n\nVector AB: from i to j: (cos(30j\u00b0) - cos(30i\u00b0), sin(30j\u00b0) - sin(30i\u00b0)).\n\nVector BC: from j to k: (cos(30k\u00b0) - cos(30j\u00b0), sin(30k\u00b0) - sin(30j\u00b0)).\n\nDot product = 0.\n\nLet\u2019s compute this:\n\n[cos(30j) - cos(30i)][cos(30k) - cos(30j)] + [sin(30j) - sin(30i)][sin(30k) - sin(30j)] = 0.\n\nExpanding this:\n\n(cos30j cos30k - cos30j^2 - cos30i cos30k + cos30i cos30j) + (sin30j sin30k - sin30j^2 - sin30i sin30k + sin30i sin30j) = 0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\ncos30j cos30k + sin30j sin30k - cos30j^2 - sin30j^2 - cos30i cos30k - sin30i sin30k + cos30i cos30j + sin30i sin30j = 0.\n\nNote that cos30j cos30k + sin30j sin30k = cos(30(k - j)).\n\nSimilarly, cos30j^2 + sin30j^2 = 1.\n\nAlso, cos30i cos30k + sin30i sin30k = cos(30(k - i)).\n\nAnd cos30i cos30j + sin30i sin30j = cos(30(j - i)).\n\nSo, substituting:\n\ncos(30(k - j)) - 1 - cos(30(k - i)) + cos(30(j - i)) = 0.\n\nBut since k - j = b and j - i = a, so k - i = a + b.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\ncos(30b) - 1 - cos(30(a + b)) + cos(30a) = 0.\n\nLet\u2019s write this as:\n\ncos(30b) + cos(30a) - cos(30(a + b)) - 1 = 0.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe using trigonometric identities can help simplify.\n\nRecall that cos(A + B) = cos A cos B - sin A sin B.\n\nSo, cos(30(a + b)) = cos(30a + 30b) = cos30a cos30b - sin30a sin30b.\n\nSubstituting back:\n\ncos30b + cos30a - [cos30a cos30b - sin30a sin30b] - 1 = 0.\n\nExpanding:\n\ncos30b + cos30a - cos30a cos30b + sin30a sin30b - 1 = 0.\n\nGroup terms:\n\ncos30a + cos30b - cos30a cos30b + sin30a sin30b - 1 = 0.\n\nNotice that cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B.",

So, the vertices are at angles 0\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 60\u00b0, ..., 330\u00b0.\n\nNow, to form a rectangle, I need four points such that the midpoints of the diagonals coincide (which is the center of the rectangle) and the sides are perpendicular.",
