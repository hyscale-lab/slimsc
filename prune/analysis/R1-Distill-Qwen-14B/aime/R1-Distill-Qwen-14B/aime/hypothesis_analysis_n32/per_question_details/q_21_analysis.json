          "text2": "Wait, actually, (s\u00b2 -s) must be divisible by (b-1). So, (b-1) must divide s(s -1).\n\nSo, for each s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1], check if (b-1) divides s(s -1). If yes, then compute a=(s\u00b2 -s)/(b-1). If a is between 1 and b-1, then it's a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (b-1) divides s(s -1) and a=(s\u00b2 -s)/(b-1) is in [1, b-1].\n\nSo, now, the problem is to find the minimal b where this count exceeds 10.\n\nHmm, this seems more manageable. So, now, I can approach this by iterating over b starting from 2 upwards, and for each b, compute the number of valid s, and find the minimal b where this number exceeds 10.\n\nBut since doing this manually for each b would be time-consuming, perhaps I can find a way to model the number of s for a given b.\n\nNote that b-1 must divide s(s -1). So, for each b, the number of s is the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that s(s -1) is divisible by (b-1).\n\nNow, s and s-1 are consecutive integers, so they are coprime. Therefore, for (b-1) to divide s(s -1), (b-1) must be a product of two coprime factors, one dividing s and the other dividing s-1.\n\nSo, let me factor (b-1) as d1*d2, where d1 and d2 are coprime, and d1 divides s, d2 divides s-1.\n\nSince s and s-1 are coprime, the factors d1 and d2 must be such that d1 divides s and d2 divides s-1.\n\nMoreover, since s and s-1 are consecutive, the only common divisors are 1, so d1 and d2 must be coprime.\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions s is equal to the number of ways to write (b-1) as a product of two coprime factors d1 and d2, and then solve for s \u22610 mod d1 and s \u22611 mod d2.\n\nEach such pair (d1, d2) gives a unique solution modulo d1*d2 =b-1.\n\nSo, for each such factorization, there's a unique solution s modulo (b-1). Since s must be in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1], each such s corresponds to a unique solution.\n\nTherefore, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of ways to factor (b-1) into two coprime factors d1 and d2, such that s \u22610 mod d1 and s \u22611 mod d2, and s is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1].\n\nBut the number of such factorizations is equal to 2^{k-1}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of (b-1). Because each distinct prime can go to d1 or d2, but since d1 and d2 must be coprime, each prime factor must entirely go to one of the factors.",

Yes. a=(400 -20)/20=380/20=19. c=20Okay, so I have this problem here about b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand it step by step. \n\nThe problem says that for an integer b \u2265 2, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. \n\nThe example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because 81 in base 13 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and the digits 6 and 3 add up to 9, which is the square root of 81. That makes sense.\n\nThe question asks for the least integer b (b \u2265 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, I need to find the smallest base b such that there are more than ten numbers n that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nLet me break down what it means for n to be a two-digit number in base b. In any base b, a two-digit number is of the form d1 * b + d0, where d1 and d0 are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, d1 can't be zero. Also, both digits must satisfy 0 \u2264 d1, d0 \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, n = d1 * b + d0. The sum of the digits is s = d1 + d0. The condition is that s = sqrt(n). Therefore, s must be an integer because the square root of n must be an integer for the sum of the digits to equal it. So, n must be a perfect square.\n\nSo, n = s\u00b2, and s = d1 + d0. Also, n = d1 * b + d0. So, substituting n with s\u00b2, we have:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1 * b + d0.\n\nBut since s = d1 + d0, we can express d0 as s - d1. Let me substitute that into the equation:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1 * b + (s - d1).\n\nSimplify this equation:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1 * b + s - d1  \ns\u00b2 = d1*(b - 1) + s.\n\nLet me rearrange the terms to solve for d1:\n\nd1*(b - 1) = s\u00b2 - s  \nd1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1).\n\nSo, d1 must be an integer because it's a digit in base b. Also, since d1 is a digit, it must satisfy 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b - 1 (since d1 can't be zero in a two-digit number).\n\nSimilarly, d0 = s - d1 must satisfy 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b - 1. So, d0 must be a non-negative integer less than b.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each base b, find all possible s such that:\n\n1. s is a positive integer (since s = d1 + d0, and d1 \u2265 1, d0 \u2265 0, s \u2265 1).\n\n2. The equation d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1) must yield an integer d1, and 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b - 1.\n\n3. Then, d0 = s - d1 must satisfy 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, for each base b, we can compute possible s values, check if (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and then verify if d1 and d0 are valid digits.\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest b where the number of such n (which correspond to valid s) is more than ten.\n\nSo, how do we approach this? Let's think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, for a given b, we can find all possible s by considering the possible values of s\u00b2 = n, which is a two-digit number in base b. So, n must be between b (the smallest two-digit number in base b, which is 10_b = b) and (b\u00b2 - 1) (the largest two-digit number in base b, which is (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b\u00b2 - 1).\n\nTherefore, n must satisfy b \u2264 n \u2264 b\u00b2 - 1. Since n = s\u00b2, we have b \u2264 s\u00b2 \u2264 b\u00b2 - 1.\n\nTaking square roots: sqrt(b) \u2264 s \u2264 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1). But sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1) is just slightly less than b. So, s can range from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1)).\n\nBut since s must be an integer, s can range from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b - 1, because sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1) is less than b.",

So, k can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to floor(sqrt(b^2 - 1)).\n\nBut sqrt(b^2 - 1) is approximately b - 1/(2b), so it's less than b. So floor(sqrt(b^2 - 1)) is b - 1.",

Therefore, k <= b-1, because (b)^2 is b^2, which is not less than b^2, but n is less than b^2, so k can be up to b-1.\n\nSo, k ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1.\n\nSo, for each base b, I can iterate k from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1, and for each k, see if there exist digits a and c in base b such that:\n\n1. a + c = k\n2. a*b + c = k^2.\n\nSo, substituting a + c = k, we can express c = k - a.

For each k from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1:\n   a. Compute (k^2 - k). Check if it's divisible by (b -1). If yes, compute a = (k^2 - k)/(b -1).\n   b. Check if a is an integer between 1 and b-1.\n   c.

Not exactly, because d divides k(k -1), and since k and k-1 are coprime, d must be a product of factors from k and k-1.\n\nBut since d is fixed, perhaps we can express d as a product of two coprime factors m and n, such that m divides k and n divides k-1. Since k and k-1 are coprime, m and n must be coprime as well.\n\nSo, for d = m * n, where gcd(m, n) =1, then k \u22610 mod m and k \u22611 mod n.\n\nThis is a system of congruences that can be solved using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). The number of solutions k modulo d will be 1 if m and n are coprime.\n\nBut since d can be written as m * n in multiple ways, each factorization corresponds to a different solution.\n\nTherefore, for each divisor m of d, where m divides d and m \u2264 sqrt(d), we can set n = d/m, and then solve for k \u22610 mod m and k\u22611 mod n.\n\nEach such system would yield a unique solution modulo d. So, the number of solutions for k in a given range would be roughly equal to the number of such factorizations.\n\nBut this seems a bit too abstract.

Since k must be even, 3s +1 must be even. So, 3s must be odd.

Yes. a=(400 -20)/20=380/20=19. c=20Okay, so I have this problem here about b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand it step by step. \n\nThe problem says that for an integer b \u2265 2, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. \n\nThe example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because 81 in base 13 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and the digits 6 and 3 add up to 9, which is the square root of 81. That makes sense.\n\nThe question asks for the least integer b (b \u2265 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, I need to find the smallest base b such that there are more than ten numbers n that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nLet me break down what it means for n to be a two-digit number in base b. In any base b, a two-digit number is of the form d1 * b + d0, where d1 and d0 are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, d1 can't be zero. Also, both digits must satisfy 0 \u2264 d1, d0 \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, n = d1 * b + d0. The sum of the digits is s = d1 + d0. The condition is that s = sqrt(n). Therefore, s must be an integer because the square root of n must be an integer for the sum of the digits to equal it. So, n must be a perfect square.\n\nSo, n = s\u00b2, and s = d1 + d0. Also, n = d1 * b + d0. So, substituting n with s\u00b2, we have:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1 * b + d0.\n\nBut since s = d1 + d0, we can express d0 as s - d1. Let me substitute that into the equation:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1 * b + (s - d1).\n\nSimplify this equation:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1 * b + s - d1  \ns\u00b2 = d1*(b - 1) + s.\n\nLet me rearrange the terms to solve for d1:\n\nd1*(b - 1) = s\u00b2 - s  \nd1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1).\n\nSo, d1 must be an integer because it's a digit in base b. Also, since d1 is a digit, it must satisfy 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b - 1 (since d1 can't be zero in a two-digit number).\n\nSimilarly, d0 = s - d1 must satisfy 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b - 1. So, d0 must be a non-negative integer less than b.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each base b, find all possible s such that:\n\n1. s is a positive integer (since s = d1 + d0, and d1 \u2265 1, d0 \u2265 0, s \u2265 1).\n\n2. The equation d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1) must yield an integer d1, and 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b - 1.\n\n3. Then, d0 = s - d1 must satisfy 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, for each base b, we can compute possible s values, check if (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and then verify if d1 and d0 are valid digits.\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest b where the number of such n (which correspond to valid s) is more than ten.\n\nSo, how do we approach this? Let's think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, for a given b, we can find all possible s by considering the possible values of s\u00b2 = n, which is a two-digit number in base b. So, n must be between b (the smallest two-digit number in base b, which is 10_b = b) and (b\u00b2 - 1) (the largest two-digit number in base b, which is (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b\u00b2 - 1).\n\nTherefore, n must satisfy b \u2264 n \u2264 b\u00b2 - 1. Since n = s\u00b2, we have b \u2264 s\u00b2 \u2264 b\u00b2 - 1.\n\nTaking square roots: sqrt(b) \u2264 s \u2264 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1). But sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1) is just slightly less than b. So, s can range from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1)).\n\nBut since s must be an integer, s can range from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b - 1, because sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1) is less than b.",

When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits.\n2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.\n\nAn example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because when you write 81 in base 13, it's 63_13, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81.\n\nAlright, so I need to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such numbers n. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's represent n in base b. If n is a two-digit number in base b, it can be written as:\nn = a * b + c\nHere, a and c are the digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero. Also, in base b, the digits a and c must satisfy 0 \u2264 a, c \u2264 b-1.\n\nThe second condition is that the sum of the digits equals the square root of n. So,\na + c = sqrt(n)\n\nSince sqrt(n) must be an integer because a and c are integers, n must be a perfect square. Let me denote sqrt(n) as k, where k is a positive integer. Therefore,\nn = k\u00b2\nAnd from the first equation,\nk = a + c\nSubstituting into n's equation:\nk\u00b2 = a * b + c\n\nSo, substituting c from the second equation into the first gives:\nk\u00b2 = a * b + (k - a)\nWhich simplifies to:\nk\u00b2 = a * b + k - a\nLet me rearrange terms:\nk\u00b2 - k = a * (b - 1)\nSo, a = (k\u00b2 - k) / (b - 1)\n\nNow, since a must be a digit in base b, it must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b - 1. Similarly, c = k - a must also satisfy 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, I can express a in terms of k and b:\na = (k\u00b2 - k)/(b - 1)\nWhich implies that (k\u00b2 - k) must be divisible by (b - 1) for a to be an integer.\n\nTherefore, (b - 1) must be a divisor of (k\u00b2 - k). Also, since a must be at least 1, (k\u00b2 - k)/(b - 1) \u2265 1.\n\nLet me write down these conditions:\n\n1. (b - 1) divides (k\u00b2 - k) \u2192 (b - 1) | (k\u00b2 - k)\n2. 1 \u2264 a = (k\u00b2 - k)/(b - 1) \u2264 b - 1\n3. c = k - a must satisfy 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, for each base b, I need to find all integers k such that the above conditions are satisfied, and count the number of such n = k\u00b2, which are b-eautiful.\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest b where the number of such n exceeds 10.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nSince I need to find the smallest b, I can start checking bases starting from b=2 upwards until I find one with more than ten b-eautiful numbers.\n\nBut this might be time-consuming, so perhaps I can find a smarter way.\n\nLet me analyze the equation:\na = (k\u00b2 - k)/(b - 1)\nSo, since a must be a positive integer (since it's a digit in the two-digit number), (b - 1) must divide (k\u00b2 - k).\n\nLet me denote d = b - 1. So, d divides k\u00b2 - k, which is k(k - 1). Therefore, d must be a divisor of k(k - 1).\n\nSince k and k - 1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, d must be a product of factors from k and k - 1.\n\nBut d = b - 1, which is \u22651 for b \u22652.\n\nAlso, since a must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b - 1, which is 1 \u2264 a \u2264 d.\n\nGiven that a = (k\u00b2 - k)/d, so (k\u00b2 - k)/d must be \u2264 d.\n\nSo,\n(k\u00b2 - k)/d \u2264 d\n=> k\u00b2 - k \u2264 d\u00b2\nBut since d = b -1, and b is the base, which for a two-digit number must be at least 2 (so d \u22651), but for a two-digit number, the maximum n is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b\u00b2 -1. Therefore, the maximum k is sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) \u2248 b.\n\nBut let's think about constraints on k.\n\nSince n is a two-digit number in base b, n must satisfy b \u2264 n \u2264 b\u00b2 -1. So, k = sqrt(n) must satisfy sqrt(b) \u2264 k \u2264 sqrt(b\u00b2 -1). Since sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) is just a bit less than b, so k can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 -1)). But since n is a perfect square, k must be integer, so k ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 -1)).\n\nBut perhaps more importantly, since n is a two-digit number in base b, n is between b and b\u00b2 -1. So, k\u00b2 is between b and b\u00b2 -1. Therefore:\n\nsqrt(b) \u2264 k \u2264 sqrt(b\u00b2 -1)\nWhich is roughly:\nb^{1/2} \u2264 k \u2264 b - \u03b5, where \u03b5 is a small positive number.\n\nBut since k is an integer, k can range from the smallest integer greater than or equal to sqrt(b) up to b -1. Because when k = b, k\u00b2 = b\u00b2, which is a three-digit number in base b (since b\u00b2 in base b is written as 100_b), so k can't be equal to b.",

Yes. a=(400 -20)/20=380/20=19. c=20Okay, so I have this problem here about b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand it step by step. \n\nThe problem says that for an integer b \u2265 2, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. \n\nThe example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because 81 in base 13 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and the digits 6 and 3 add up to 9, which is the square root of 81. That makes sense.\n\nThe question asks for the least integer b (b \u2265 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, I need to find the smallest base b such that there are more than ten numbers n that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nLet me break down what it means for n to be a two-digit number in base b. In any base b, a two-digit number is of the form d1 * b + d0, where d1 and d0 are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, d1 can't be zero. Also, both digits must satisfy 0 \u2264 d1, d0 \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, n = d1 * b + d0. The sum of the digits is s = d1 + d0. The condition is that s = sqrt(n). Therefore, s must be an integer because the square root of n must be an integer for the sum of the digits to equal it. So, n must be a perfect square.\n\nSo, n = s\u00b2, and s = d1 + d0. Also, n = d1 * b + d0. So, substituting n with s\u00b2, we have:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1 * b + d0.\n\nBut since s = d1 + d0, we can express d0 as s - d1. Let me substitute that into the equation:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1 * b + (s - d1).\n\nSimplify this equation:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1 * b + s - d1  \ns\u00b2 = d1*(b - 1) + s.\n\nLet me rearrange the terms to solve for d1:\n\nd1*(b - 1) = s\u00b2 - s  \nd1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1).\n\nSo, d1 must be an integer because it's a digit in base b. Also, since d1 is a digit, it must satisfy 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b - 1 (since d1 can't be zero in a two-digit number).\n\nSimilarly, d0 = s - d1 must satisfy 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b - 1. So, d0 must be a non-negative integer less than b.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each base b, find all possible s such that:\n\n1. s is a positive integer (since s = d1 + d0, and d1 \u2265 1, d0 \u2265 0, s \u2265 1).\n\n2. The equation d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1) must yield an integer d1, and 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b - 1.\n\n3. Then, d0 = s - d1 must satisfy 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, for each base b, we can compute possible s values, check if (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and then verify if d1 and d0 are valid digits.\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest b where the number of such n (which correspond to valid s) is more than ten.\n\nSo, how do we approach this? Let's think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, for a given b, we can find all possible s by considering the possible values of s\u00b2 = n, which is a two-digit number in base b.

So, k can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to floor(sqrt(b^2 - 1)).\n\nBut sqrt(b^2 - 1) is approximately b - 1/(2b), so it's less than b. So floor(sqrt(b^2 - 1)) is b - 1.",

Therefore, k <= b-1, because (b)^2 is b^2, which is not less than b^2, but n is less than b^2, so k can be up to b-1.\n\nSo, k ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1.\n\nSo, for each base b, I can iterate k from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1, and for each k, see if there exist digits a and c in base b such that:\n\n1. a + c = k\n2. a*b + c = k^2.\n\nSo, substituting a + c = k, we can express c = k - a.

For each k from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1:\n   a. Compute (k^2 - k). Check if it's divisible by (b -1). If yes, compute a = (k^2 - k)/(b -1).\n   b. Check if a is an integer between 1 and b-1.\n   c.

Yes. a=(400 -20)/20=380/20=19. c=20Okay, so I have this problem here about b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand it step by step. \n\nThe problem says that for an integer b \u2265 2, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. \n\nThe example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because 81 in base 13 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and the digits 6 and 3 add up to 9, which is the square root of 81. That makes sense.\n\nThe question asks for the least integer b (b \u2265 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, I need to find the smallest base b such that there are more than ten numbers n that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nLet me break down what it means for n to be a two-digit number in base b. In any base b, a two-digit number is of the form d1 * b + d0, where d1 and d0 are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, d1 can't be zero. Also, both digits must satisfy 0 \u2264 d1, d0 \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, n = d1 * b + d0. The sum of the digits is s = d1 + d0. The condition is that s = sqrt(n). Therefore, s must be an integer because the square root of n must be an integer for the sum of the digits to equal it. So, n must be a perfect square.\n\nSo, n = s\u00b2, and s = d1 + d0. Also, n = d1 * b + d0. So, substituting n with s\u00b2, we have:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1 * b + d0.\n\nBut since s = d1 + d0, we can express d0 as s - d1. Let me substitute that into the equation:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1 * b + (s - d1).\n\nSimplify this equation:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1 * b + s - d1  \ns\u00b2 = d1*(b - 1) + s.\n\nLet me rearrange the terms to solve for d1:\n\nd1*(b - 1) = s\u00b2 - s  \nd1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1).\n\nSo, d1 must be an integer because it's a digit in base b. Also, since d1 is a digit, it must satisfy 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b - 1 (since d1 can't be zero in a two-digit number).\n\nSimilarly, d0 = s - d1 must satisfy 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b - 1. So, d0 must be a non-negative integer less than b.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each base b, find all possible s such that:\n\n1. s is a positive integer (since s = d1 + d0, and d1 \u2265 1, d0 \u2265 0, s \u2265 1).\n\n2. The equation d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1) must yield an integer d1, and 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b - 1.\n\n3. Then, d0 = s - d1 must satisfy 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, for each base b, we can compute possible s values, check if (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and then verify if d1 and d0 are valid digits.\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest b where the number of such n (which correspond to valid s) is more than ten.\n\nSo, how do we approach this? Let's think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, for a given b, we can find all possible s by considering the possible values of s\u00b2 = n, which is a two-digit number in base b. So, n must be between b (the smallest two-digit number in base b, which is 10_b = b) and (b\u00b2 - 1) (the largest two-digit number in base b, which is (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b\u00b2 - 1).\n\nTherefore, n must satisfy b \u2264 n \u2264 b\u00b2 - 1. Since n = s\u00b2, we have b \u2264 s\u00b2 \u2264 b\u00b2 - 1.\n\nTaking square roots: sqrt(b) \u2264 s \u2264 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1). But sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1) is just slightly less than b. So, s can range from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1)).\n\nBut since s must be an integer, s can range from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b - 1, because sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1) is less than b.",

          "text2": "Wait, perhaps the maximum k is when a is 1, so let's see:\n\nFrom a = (k^2 -k)/m, where m = b -1, and a <= k.\n\nSo, (k^2 -k)/m <= k => (k^2 -k) <= m*k => k^2 -k -m*k <=0 => k^2 - (m + 1)k <=0 => k(k - (m + 1)) <=0.\n\nSince k is positive, this implies that k <= m + 1. But since m = b -1, m+1 = b. But earlier, we thought that k <= b -1, because n is a two-digit number in base b, which is up to (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b^2 -1, so sqrt(n) is up to b -1. So, that's consistent. So, k is in [1, b -1].\n\nSo, for each m = b -1, we need to find the number of k in [1, m] such that m divides k(k -1), and a = (k^2 -k)/m is in [1, k].\n\nSo, for each m, the number of k's is equal to the number of integers k in [1, m] such that m divides k(k - 1) and 1 <= (k^2 -k)/m <= k.\n\nLet me try to compute for small m and see if I can find a pattern.",

          "text2": "Wait, but let'sOkay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the smallest integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. Hmm, let me try to understand what a b-eautiful number is first.\n\nFrom the problem statement, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:\n1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits.\n2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.\n\nAn example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because when you write 81 in base 13, it's 63_13, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81.\n\nAlright, so I need to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such numbers n. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's represent n in base b. If n is a two-digit number in base b, it can be written as:\nn = a * b + c\nHere, a and c are the digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero. Also, in base b, the digits a and c must satisfy 0 \u2264 a, c \u2264 b-1.\n\nThe second condition is that the sum of the digits equals the square root of n. So,\na + c = sqrt(n)\n\nSince sqrt(n) must be an integer because a and c are integers, n must be a perfect square. Let me denote sqrt(n) as k, where k is a positive integer. Therefore,\nn = k\u00b2\nAnd from the first equation,\nk = a + c\nSubstituting into n's equation:\nk\u00b2 = a * b + c\n\nSo, substituting c from the second equation into the first gives:\nk\u00b2 = a * b + (k - a)\nWhich simplifies to:\nk\u00b2 = a * b + k - a\nLet me rearrange terms:\nk\u00b2 - k = a * (b - 1)\nSo, a = (k\u00b2 - k) / (b - 1)\n\nNow, since a must be a digit in base b, it must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b - 1. Similarly, c = k - a must also satisfy 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, I can express a in terms of k and b:\na = (k\u00b2 - k)/(b - 1)\nWhich implies that (k\u00b2 - k) must be divisible by (b - 1) for a to be an integer.\n\nTherefore, (b - 1) must be a divisor of (k\u00b2 - k). Also, since a must be at least 1, (k\u00b2 - k)/(b - 1) \u2265 1.\n\nLet me write down these conditions:\n\n1. (b - 1) divides (k\u00b2 - k) \u2192 (b - 1) | (k\u00b2 - k)\n2. 1 \u2264 a = (k\u00b2 - k)/(b - 1) \u2264 b - 1\n3. c = k - a must satisfy 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, for each base b, I need to find all integers k such that the above conditions are satisfied, and count the number of such n = k\u00b2, which are b-eautiful.\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest b where the number of such n exceeds 10.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nSince I need to find the smallest b, I can start checking bases starting from b=2 upwards until I find one with more than ten b-eautiful numbers.\n\nBut this might be time-consuming, so perhaps I can find a smarter way.\n\nLet me analyze the equation:\na = (k\u00b2 - k)/(b - 1)\nSo, since a must be a positive integer (since it's a digit in the two-digit number), (b - 1) must divide (k\u00b2 - k).\n\nLet me denote d = b - 1. So, d divides k\u00b2 - k, which is k(k - 1). Therefore, d must be a divisor of k(k - 1).\n\nSince k and k - 1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, d must be a product of factors from k and k - 1.\n\nBut d = b - 1, which is \u22651 for b \u22652.\n\nAlso, since a must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b - 1, which is 1 \u2264 a \u2264 d.\n\nGiven that a = (k\u00b2 - k)/d, so (k\u00b2 - k)/d must be \u2264 d.\n\nSo,\n(k\u00b2 - k)/d \u2264 d\n=> k\u00b2 - k \u2264 d\u00b2\nBut since d = b -1, and b is the base, which for a two-digit number must be at least 2 (so d \u22651), but for a two-digit number, the maximum n is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b\u00b2 -1. Therefore, the maximum k is sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) \u2248 b.\n\nBut let's think about constraints on k.\n\nSince n is a two-digit number in base b, n must satisfy b \u2264 n \u2264 b\u00b2 -1. So, k = sqrt(n) must satisfy sqrt(b) \u2264 k \u2264 sqrt(b\u00b2 -1). Since sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) is just a bit less than b, so k can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 -1)). But since n is a perfect square, k must be integer, so k ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 -1)).\n\nBut perhaps more importantly, since n is a two-digit number in base b, n is between b and b\u00b2 -1. So, k\u00b2 is between b and b\u00b2 -1. Therefore:\n\nsqrt(b) \u2264 k \u2264 sqrt(b\u00b2 -1)\nWhich is roughly:\nb^{1/2} \u2264 k \u2264 b - \u03b5, where \u03b5 is a small positive number.\n\nBut since k is an integer, k can range from the smallest integer greater than or equal to sqrt(b) up to b -1. Because when k = b, k\u00b2 = b\u00b2, which is a three-digit number in base b (since b\u00b2 in base b is written as 100_b), so k can't be equal to b.",

So, (b - 1) | (k\u00b2 - k), which is the same as (b - 1) | k(k - 1).\n\nNote that k and k-1 are consecutive integers, so they are coprime. Therefore, (b - 1) must be a product of two coprime factors, one dividing k and the other dividing k - 1.",

So, k must satisfy k\u00b2 \u2265 b, so k \u2265 sqrt(b). So, k starts at ceil(sqrt(b)).\n\nSo, for each base b, the possible k values are from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b - 1. For each k in that range, I can compute c as (k*b - k\u00b2)/(b - 1). If c is an integer between 0 and b-1, then n = k\u00b2 is b-eautiful.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each base b starting from 2 upwards:\n   a. Determine the range of k: ceil(sqrt(b)) \u2264 k \u2264 b - 1.\n   b. For each k in this range:\n      i.

Count how many such k's exist for each b. When a base b has more than ten such numbers, return that b as the answer.\n\nI need to find the least b where this count exceeds ten.\n\nBut this seems computationally intensive if done manually for each b. Maybe I can find a formula or pattern to find how many solutions exist for a given b.\n\nLet me think about the equation again:\n\nk\u00b2 = a*b + c\n\nAnd a = k - c, so substituting:\n\nk\u00b2 = (k - c)*b + c\nk\u00b2 = k*b - c*b + c\nk\u00b2 = k*b + c*(1 - b)\nWhich leads to:\n\nc*(b - 1) = k*b - k\u00b2\nc = (k*b - k\u00b2)/(b - 1)\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\nk*b - k\u00b2 = k(b - k)\nSo, c = [k(b - k)] / (b - 1)\n\nSo, c = k*(b - k)/(b - 1)\n\nSince c must be an integer between 0 and b-1, [k*(b - k)] must be divisible by (b - 1). Also, c must be non-negative, so k*(b - k) must be non-negative. Since b > k (because k \u2264 b - 1), (b - k) is positive, and k is positive, so the numerator is positive.\n\nSo, the condition is that (b - 1) divides k*(b - k). Let's denote m = b - 1, so:\n\nc = k*(m + 1 - k)/m\n\nSimplify:\n\nc = [k*(m + 1 - k)] / m\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nc = k*(m + 1 - k)/m\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nc = k*( (m + 1 - k) ) / m",

Yes. a=(400 -20)/20=380/20=19. c=20Okay, so I have this problem here about b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand it step by step. \n\nThe problem says that for an integer b \u2265 2, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. \n\nThe example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because 81 in base 13 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and the digits 6 and 3 add up to 9, which is the square root of 81. That makes sense.\n\nThe question asks for the least integer b (b \u2265 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, I need to find the smallest base b such that there are more than ten numbers n that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nLet me break down what it means for n to be a two-digit number in base b. In any base b, a two-digit number is of the form d1 * b + d0, where d1 and d0 are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, d1 can't be zero. Also, both digits must satisfy 0 \u2264 d1, d0 \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, n = d1 * b + d0. The sum of the digits is s = d1 + d0. The condition is that s = sqrt(n). Therefore, s must be an integer because the square root of n must be an integer for the sum of the digits to equal it. So, n must be a perfect square.\n\nSo, n = s\u00b2, and s = d1 + d0. Also, n = d1 * b + d0. So, substituting n with s\u00b2, we have:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1 * b + d0.\n\nBut since s = d1 + d0, we can express d0 as s - d1. Let me substitute that into the equation:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1 * b + (s - d1).\n\nSimplify this equation:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1 * b + s - d1  \ns\u00b2 = d1*(b - 1) + s.\n\nLet me rearrange the terms to solve for d1:\n\nd1*(b - 1) = s\u00b2 - s  \nd1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1).\n\nSo, d1 must be an integer because it's a digit in base b. Also, since d1 is a digit, it must satisfy 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b - 1 (since d1 can't be zero in a two-digit number).\n\nSimilarly, d0 = s - d1 must satisfy 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b - 1. So, d0 must be a non-negative integer less than b.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each base b, find all possible s such that:\n\n1. s is a positive integer (since s = d1 + d0, and d1 \u2265 1, d0 \u2265 0, s \u2265 1).\n\n2. The equation d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1) must yield an integer d1, and 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b - 1.\n\n3. Then, d0 = s - d1 must satisfy 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, for each base b, we can compute possible s values, check if (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and then verify if d1 and d0 are valid digits.\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest b where the number of such n (which correspond to valid s) is more than ten.\n\nSo, how do we approach this? Let's think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, for a given b, we can find all possible s by considering the possible values of s\u00b2 = n, which is a two-digit number in base b. So, n must be between b (the smallest two-digit number in base b, which is 10_b = b) and (b\u00b2 - 1) (the largest two-digit number in base b, which is (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b\u00b2 - 1).\n\nTherefore, n must satisfy b \u2264 n \u2264 b\u00b2 - 1. Since n = s\u00b2, we have b \u2264 s\u00b2 \u2264 b\u00b2 - 1.\n\nTaking square roots: sqrt(b) \u2264 s \u2264 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1). But sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1) is just slightly less than b. So, s can range from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1)).\n\nBut since s must be an integer, s can range from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b - 1, because sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1) is less than b.",

But in the example, s was 9, which is within that range.\n\nSo, for each base b, the possible s values are integers from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b - 1.\n\nFor each s in that range, we can compute d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1). If d1 is an integer, and 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b - 1, and d0 = s - d1 is between 0 and b - 1, then n = s\u00b2 is a b-eautiful number.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. For each base b starting from 2 upwards:\n\n   a. Compute the range of s: s_min = ceil(sqrt(b)), s_max = b - 1.\n\n   b. For each s from s_min to s_max:\n\n      i.

The first b where the count exceeds 10 is our answer.\n\nBut since we're looking for the smallest such b, we can increment b starting from 2 and compute the count for each until we find one with more than ten b-eautiful numbers.\n\nThis seems computationally intensive but manageable. However, since this is a problem-solving scenario, perhaps we can find a smarter way to find the minimal b without checking each one step by step.",

So, s can be 4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nHmm, so for each base b, s can take integer values starting from the ceiling of sqrt(b) up to (b-1), inclusive. So, if I fix b, I can iterate s from ceil(sqrt(b)) to (b-1), compute d1 as (s^2 - s)/(b -1), and check if d1 is an integer within [1, b-1], and then d0 = s - d1 is also within [0, b-1).\n\nSo, for each b, the number of possible s values is (b - 1) - ceil(sqrt(b)) + 1 = b - ceil(sqrt(b)).\n\nBut not all s will lead to valid d1 and d0. So, the number of b-eautiful integers for a given b is the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b - 1] such that (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b -1), and the resulting d1 is an integer in [1, b-1), and d0 = s - d1 is in [0, b-1).\n\nSo, the problem is to find the smallest b \u2265 2 such that the number of such s (and hence the number of n) is more than ten.\n\nSo, the strategy is:\n\n1.

Therefore, k <= b-1, because (b)^2 is b^2, which is not less than b^2, but n is less than b^2, so k can be up to b-1.\n\nSo, k ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1.\n\nSo, for each base b, I can iterate k from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1, and for each k, see if there exist digits a and c in base b such that:\n\n1. a + c = k\n2. a*b + c = k^2.\n\nSo, substituting a + c = k, we can express c = k - a. Then plug into the second equation:\n\na*b + (k - a) = k^2.\n\nSimplify this:\n\na*b + k - a = k^2.\n\nFactor out a:\n\na*(b -1) + k = k^2.\n\nThen, solve for a:\n\na*(b -1) = k^2 - k.\n\nTherefore,\n\na = (k^2 - k)/(b -1).\n\nSince a must be an integer between 1 and b-1 (since it's a digit in base b, and a two-digit number so a >=1), the expression (k^2 - k) must be divisible by (b -1), and the result a must satisfy 1 <= a <= b-1.\n\nSo, the steps for each base b would be:\n\n1. For each k from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1:\n   a. Compute (k^2 - k). Check if it's divisible by (b -1). If yes, compute a = (k^2 - k)/(b -1).\n   b. Check if a is an integer between 1 and b-1.\n   c. If yes, then compute c = k - a. Check if c is between 0 and b-1.\n   d. If both a and c satisfy their constraints, then n = a*b + c =k^2 is a b-eautiful number.\n\nSo, for each b, we can go through each k in the range, compute a, and check the conditions.

Yes. a=(400 -20)/20=380/20=19. c=20Okay, so I have this problem here about b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand it step by step. \n\nThe problem says that for an integer b \u2265 2, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. \n\nThe example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because 81 in base 13 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and the digits 6 and 3 add up to 9, which is the square root of 81. That makes sense.\n\nThe question asks for the least integer b (b \u2265 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, I need to find the smallest base b such that there are more than ten numbers n that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nLet me break down what it means for n to be a two-digit number in base b. In any base b, a two-digit number is of the form d1 * b + d0, where d1 and d0 are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, d1 can't be zero. Also, both digits must satisfy 0 \u2264 d1, d0 \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, n = d1 * b + d0. The sum of the digits is s = d1 + d0. The condition is that s = sqrt(n). Therefore, s must be an integer because the square root of n must be an integer for the sum of the digits to equal it. So, n must be a perfect square.\n\nSo, n = s\u00b2, and s = d1 + d0. Also, n = d1 * b + d0. So, substituting n with s\u00b2, we have:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1 * b + d0.\n\nBut since s = d1 + d0, we can express d0 as s - d1. Let me substitute that into the equation:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1 * b + (s - d1).\n\nSimplify this equation:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1 * b + s - d1  \ns\u00b2 = d1*(b - 1) + s.\n\nLet me rearrange the terms to solve for d1:\n\nd1*(b - 1) = s\u00b2 - s  \nd1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1).\n\nSo, d1 must be an integer because it's a digit in base b. Also, since d1 is a digit, it must satisfy 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b - 1 (since d1 can't be zero in a two-digit number).\n\nSimilarly, d0 = s - d1 must satisfy 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b - 1. So, d0 must be a non-negative integer less than b.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each base b, find all possible s such that:\n\n1. s is a positive integer (since s = d1 + d0, and d1 \u2265 1, d0 \u2265 0, s \u2265 1).\n\n2. The equation d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1) must yield an integer d1, and 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b - 1.\n\n3. Then, d0 = s - d1 must satisfy 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, for each base b, we can compute possible s values, check if (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and then verify if d1 and d0 are valid digits.\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest b where the number of such n (which correspond to valid s) is more than ten.\n\nSo, how do we approach this? Let's think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, for a given b, we can find all possible s by considering the possible values of s\u00b2 = n, which is a two-digit number in base b. So, n must be between b (the smallest two-digit number in base b, which is 10_b = b) and (b\u00b2 - 1) (the largest two-digit number in base b, which is (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b\u00b2 - 1).\n\nTherefore, n must satisfy b \u2264 n \u2264 b\u00b2 - 1. Since n = s\u00b2, we have b \u2264 s\u00b2 \u2264 b\u00b2 - 1.\n\nTaking square roots: sqrt(b) \u2264 s \u2264 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1). But sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1) is just slightly less than b. So, s can range from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1)).\n\nBut since s must be an integer, s can range from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b - 1, because sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1) is less than b.",

When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits.\n2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.\n\nAn example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because when you write 81 in base 13, it's 63_13, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81.\n\nAlright, so I need to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such numbers n. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's represent n in base b. If n is a two-digit number in base b, it can be written as:\nn = a * b + c\nHere, a and c are the digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero. Also, in base b, the digits a and c must satisfy 0 \u2264 a, c \u2264 b-1.\n\nThe second condition is that the sum of the digits equals the square root of n. So,\na + c = sqrt(n)\n\nSince sqrt(n) must be an integer because a and c are integers, n must be a perfect square. Let me denote sqrt(n) as k, where k is a positive integer. Therefore,\nn = k\u00b2\nAnd from the first equation,\nk = a + c\nSubstituting into n's equation:\nk\u00b2 = a * b + c\n\nSo, substituting c from the second equation into the first gives:\nk\u00b2 = a * b + (k - a)\nWhich simplifies to:\nk\u00b2 = a * b + k - a\nLet me rearrange terms:\nk\u00b2 - k = a * (b - 1)\nSo, a = (k\u00b2 - k) / (b - 1)\n\nNow, since a must be a digit in base b, it must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b - 1. Similarly, c = k - a must also satisfy 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, I can express a in terms of k and b:\na = (k\u00b2 - k)/(b - 1)\nWhich implies that (k\u00b2 - k) must be divisible by (b - 1) for a to be an integer.\n\nTherefore, (b - 1) must be a divisor of (k\u00b2 - k). Also, since a must be at least 1, (k\u00b2 - k)/(b - 1) \u2265 1.\n\nLet me write down these conditions:\n\n1. (b - 1) divides (k\u00b2 - k) \u2192 (b - 1) | (k\u00b2 - k)\n2. 1 \u2264 a = (k\u00b2 - k)/(b - 1) \u2264 b - 1\n3. c = k - a must satisfy 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, for each base b, I need to find all integers k such that the above conditions are satisfied, and count the number of such n = k\u00b2, which are b-eautiful.\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest b where the number of such n exceeds 10.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nSince I need to find the smallest b, I can start checking bases starting from b=2 upwards until I find one with more than ten b-eautiful numbers.\n\nBut this might be time-consuming, so perhaps I can find a smarter way.\n\nLet me analyze the equation:\na = (k\u00b2 - k)/(b - 1)\nSo, since a must be a positive integer (since it's a digit in the two-digit number), (b - 1) must divide (k\u00b2 - k).\n\nLet me denote d = b - 1. So, d divides k\u00b2 - k, which is k(k - 1). Therefore, d must be a divisor of k(k - 1).\n\nSince k and k - 1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, d must be a product of factors from k and k - 1.\n\nBut d = b - 1, which is \u22651 for b \u22652.\n\nAlso, since a must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b - 1, which is 1 \u2264 a \u2264 d.\n\nGiven that a = (k\u00b2 - k)/d, so (k\u00b2 - k)/d must be \u2264 d.\n\nSo,\n(k\u00b2 - k)/d \u2264 d\n=> k\u00b2 - k \u2264 d\u00b2\nBut since d = b -1, and b is the base, which for a two-digit number must be at least 2 (so d \u22651), but for a two-digit number, the maximum n is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b\u00b2 -1. Therefore, the maximum k is sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) \u2248 b.\n\nBut let's think about constraints on k.\n\nSince n is a two-digit number in base b, n must satisfy b \u2264 n \u2264 b\u00b2 -1. So, k = sqrt(n) must satisfy sqrt(b) \u2264 k \u2264 sqrt(b\u00b2 -1). Since sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) is just a bit less than b, so k can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 -1)). But since n is a perfect square, k must be integer, so k ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 -1)).\n\nBut perhaps more importantly, since n is a two-digit number in base b, n is between b and b\u00b2 -1. So, k\u00b2 is between b and b\u00b2 -1. Therefore:\n\nsqrt(b) \u2264 k \u2264 sqrt(b\u00b2 -1)\nWhich is roughly:\nb^{1/2} \u2264 k \u2264 b - \u03b5, where \u03b5 is a small positive number.\n\nBut since k is an integer, k can range from the smallest integer greater than or equal to sqrt(b) up to b -1. Because when k = b, k\u00b2 = b\u00b2, which is a three-digit number in base b (since b\u00b2 in base b is written as 100_b), so k can't be equal to b.",

Yes. a=(400 -20)/20=380/20=19. c=20Okay, so I have this problem here about b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand it step by step. \n\nThe problem says that for an integer b \u2265 2, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. \n\nThe example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because 81 in base 13 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and the digits 6 and 3 add up to 9, which is the square root of 81. That makes sense.\n\nThe question asks for the least integer b (b \u2265 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, I need to find the smallest base b such that there are more than ten numbers n that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nLet me break down what it means for n to be a two-digit number in base b. In any base b, a two-digit number is of the form d1 * b + d0, where d1 and d0 are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, d1 can't be zero. Also, both digits must satisfy 0 \u2264 d1, d0 \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, n = d1 * b + d0. The sum of the digits is s = d1 + d0. The condition is that s = sqrt(n). Therefore, s must be an integer because the square root of n must be an integer for the sum of the digits to equal it. So, n must be a perfect square.\n\nSo, n = s\u00b2, and s = d1 + d0. Also, n = d1 * b + d0. So, substituting n with s\u00b2, we have:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1 * b + d0.\n\nBut since s = d1 + d0, we can express d0 as s - d1. Let me substitute that into the equation:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1 * b + (s - d1).\n\nSimplify this equation:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1 * b + s - d1  \ns\u00b2 = d1*(b - 1) + s.\n\nLet me rearrange the terms to solve for d1:\n\nd1*(b - 1) = s\u00b2 - s  \nd1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1).\n\nSo, d1 must be an integer because it's a digit in base b. Also, since d1 is a digit, it must satisfy 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b - 1 (since d1 can't be zero in a two-digit number).\n\nSimilarly, d0 = s - d1 must satisfy 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b - 1. So, d0 must be a non-negative integer less than b.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each base b, find all possible s such that:\n\n1. s is a positive integer (since s = d1 + d0, and d1 \u2265 1, d0 \u2265 0, s \u2265 1).\n\n2. The equation d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1) must yield an integer d1, and 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b - 1.\n\n3. Then, d0 = s - d1 must satisfy 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, for each base b, we can compute possible s values, check if (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and then verify if d1 and d0 are valid digits.\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest b where the number of such n (which correspond to valid s) is more than ten.\n\nSo, how do we approach this? Let's think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, for a given b, we can find all possible s by considering the possible values of s\u00b2 = n, which is a two-digit number in base b. So, n must be between b (the smallest two-digit number in base b, which is 10_b = b) and (b\u00b2 - 1) (the largest two-digit number in base b, which is (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b\u00b2 - 1).\n\nTherefore, n must satisfy b \u2264 n \u2264 b\u00b2 - 1. Since n = s\u00b2, we have b \u2264 s\u00b2 \u2264 b\u00b2 - 1.\n\nTaking square roots: sqrt(b) \u2264 s \u2264 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1). But sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1) is just slightly less than b. So, s can range from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1)).\n\nBut since s must be an integer, s can range from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b - 1, because sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1) is less than b.",

But in the example, s was 9, which is within that range.\n\nSo, for each base b, the possible s values are integers from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b - 1.\n\nFor each s in that range, we can compute d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1). If d1 is an integer, and 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b - 1, and d0 = s - d1 is between 0 and b - 1, then n = s\u00b2 is a b-eautiful number.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1.

However, since this is a problem-solving scenario, perhaps we can find a smarter way to find the minimal b without checking each one step by step.",
          "text2": "Another example: let's say b = 10. Then, n must be a two-digit number, from 10 to 99. So sqrt(n) must be from 4 (since sqrt(10) ~3.16, so the next integer is 4) up to 9. So, s can be 4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nHmm, so for each base b, s can take integer values starting from the ceiling of sqrt(b) up to (b-1), inclusive. So, if I fix b, I can iterate s from ceil(sqrt(b)) to (b-1), compute d1 as (s^2 - s)/(b -1), and check if d1 is an integer within [1, b-1], and then d0 = s - d1 is also within [0, b-1).\n\nSo, for each b, the number of possible s values is (b - 1) - ceil(sqrt(b)) + 1 = b - ceil(sqrt(b)).\n\nBut not all s will lead to valid d1 and d0. So, the number of b-eautiful integers for a given b is the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b - 1] such that (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b -1), and the resulting d1 is an integer in [1, b-1), and d0 = s - d1 is in [0, b-1).\n\nSo, the problem is to find the smallest b \u2265 2 such that the number of such s (and hence the number of n) is more than ten.\n\nSo, the strategy is:\n\n1.

Then plug into the second equation:\n\na*b + (k - a) = k^2.\n\nSimplify this:\n\na*b + k - a = k^2.\n\nFactor out a:\n\na*(b -1) + k = k^2.\n\nThen, solve for a:\n\na*(b -1) = k^2 - k.\n\nTherefore,\n\na = (k^2 - k)/(b -1).\n\nSince a must be an integer between 1 and b-1 (since it's a digit in base b, and a two-digit number so a >=1), the expression (k^2 - k) must be divisible by (b -1), and the result a must satisfy 1 <= a <= b-1.\n\nSo, the steps for each base b would be:\n\n1. For each k from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1:\n   a. Compute (k^2 - k). Check if it's divisible by (b -1). If yes, compute a = (k^2 - k)/(b -1).\n   b. Check if a is an integer between 1 and b-1.\n   c. If yes, then compute c = k - a. Check if c is between 0 and b-1.\n   d. If both a and c satisfy their constraints, then n = a*b + c =k^2 is a b-eautiful number.\n\nSo, for each b, we can go through each k in the range, compute a, and check the conditions. If they hold, then we count that n as b-eautiful.\n\nNow, the task is to find the smallest b >=2 such that the number of such n is more than ten.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n- For each base b starting from 2 upwards:\n   - For each k from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1:\n      - Compute numerator = k^2 -k.\n      - Check if (b-1) divides numerator.\n      - If yes, compute a = numerator / (b-1).\n      - Check if a is integer and 1 <=a <=b-1.\n      - If yes, compute c = k -a.\n      - Check if 0 <=c <=b-1.\n      - If yes, then count this as a valid b-eautiful number.\n   - After checking all k for this b, if the count is >10, then return this b as the answer.\n\nBut to find the minimal b, I'll have to start from b=2 and move upwards, checking each b until I find one where the count exceeds ten.\n\nThis seems computationally intensive, but perhaps we can find a pattern or formula to make it easier.",

Not exactly, because d divides k(k -1), and since k and k-1 are coprime, d must be a product of factors from k and k-1.\n\nBut since d is fixed, perhaps we can express d as a product of two coprime factors m and n, such that m divides k and n divides k-1. Since k and k-1 are coprime, m and n must be coprime as well.\n\nSo, for d = m * n, where gcd(m, n) =1, then k \u22610 mod m and k \u22611 mod n.\n\nThis is a system of congruences that can be solved using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). The number of solutions k modulo d will be 1 if m and n are coprime.\n\nBut since d can be written as m * n in multiple ways, each factorization corresponds to a different solution.\n\nTherefore, for each divisor m of d, where m divides d and m \u2264 sqrt(d), we can set n = d/m, and then solve for k \u22610 mod m and k\u22611 mod n.\n\nEach such system would yield a unique solution modulo d.

Yes. a=(400 -20)/20=380/20=19. c=20Okay, so I have this problem here about b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand it step by step. \n\nThe problem says that for an integer b \u2265 2, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. \n\nThe example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because 81 in base 13 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and the digits 6 and 3 add up to 9, which is the square root of 81. That makes sense.\n\nThe question asks for the least integer b (b \u2265 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, I need to find the smallest base b such that there are more than ten numbers n that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nLet me break down what it means for n to be a two-digit number in base b. In any base b, a two-digit number is of the form d1 * b + d0, where d1 and d0 are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, d1 can't be zero. Also, both digits must satisfy 0 \u2264 d1, d0 \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, n = d1 * b + d0. The sum of the digits is s = d1 + d0. The condition is that s = sqrt(n). Therefore, s must be an integer because the square root of n must be an integer for the sum of the digits to equal it. So, n must be a perfect square.\n\nSo, n = s\u00b2, and s = d1 + d0. Also, n = d1 * b + d0. So, substituting n with s\u00b2, we have:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1 * b + d0.\n\nBut since s = d1 + d0, we can express d0 as s - d1. Let me substitute that into the equation:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1 * b + (s - d1).\n\nSimplify this equation:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1 * b + s - d1  \ns\u00b2 = d1*(b - 1) + s.\n\nLet me rearrange the terms to solve for d1:\n\nd1*(b - 1) = s\u00b2 - s  \nd1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1).\n\nSo, d1 must be an integer because it's a digit in base b. Also, since d1 is a digit, it must satisfy 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b - 1 (since d1 can't be zero in a two-digit number).\n\nSimilarly, d0 = s - d1 must satisfy 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b - 1. So, d0 must be a non-negative integer less than b.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each base b, find all possible s such that:\n\n1. s is a positive integer (since s = d1 + d0, and d1 \u2265 1, d0 \u2265 0, s \u2265 1).\n\n2. The equation d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1) must yield an integer d1, and 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b - 1.\n\n3. Then, d0 = s - d1 must satisfy 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, for each base b, we can compute possible s values, check if (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and then verify if d1 and d0 are valid digits.\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest b where the number of such n (which correspond to valid s) is more than ten.\n\nSo, how do we approach this? Let's think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, for a given b, we can find all possible s by considering the possible values of s\u00b2 = n, which is a two-digit number in base b. So, n must be between b (the smallest two-digit number in base b, which is 10_b = b) and (b\u00b2 - 1) (the largest two-digit number in base b, which is (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b\u00b2 - 1).\n\nTherefore, n must satisfy b \u2264 n \u2264 b\u00b2 - 1. Since n = s\u00b2, we have b \u2264 s\u00b2 \u2264 b\u00b2 - 1.\n\nTaking square roots: sqrt(b) \u2264 s \u2264 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1). But sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1) is just slightly less than b. So, s can range from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1)).\n\nBut since s must be an integer, s can range from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b - 1, because sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1) is less than b.",

When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits.\n2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.\n\nAn example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because when you write 81 in base 13, it's 63_13, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81.\n\nAlright, so I need to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such numbers n. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's represent n in base b. If n is a two-digit number in base b, it can be written as:\nn = a * b + c\nHere, a and c are the digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero. Also, in base b, the digits a and c must satisfy 0 \u2264 a, c \u2264 b-1.\n\nThe second condition is that the sum of the digits equals the square root of n. So,\na + c = sqrt(n)\n\nSince sqrt(n) must be an integer because a and c are integers, n must be a perfect square. Let me denote sqrt(n) as k, where k is a positive integer. Therefore,\nn = k\u00b2\nAnd from the first equation,\nk = a + c\nSubstituting into n's equation:\nk\u00b2 = a * b + c\n\nSo, substituting c from the second equation into the first gives:\nk\u00b2 = a * b + (k - a)\nWhich simplifies to:\nk\u00b2 = a * b + k - a\nLet me rearrange terms:\nk\u00b2 - k = a * (b - 1)\nSo, a = (k\u00b2 - k) / (b - 1)\n\nNow, since a must be a digit in base b, it must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b - 1. Similarly, c = k - a must also satisfy 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, I can express a in terms of k and b:\na = (k\u00b2 - k)/(b - 1)\nWhich implies that (k\u00b2 - k) must be divisible by (b - 1) for a to be an integer.\n\nTherefore, (b - 1) must be a divisor of (k\u00b2 - k). Also, since a must be at least 1, (k\u00b2 - k)/(b - 1) \u2265 1.\n\nLet me write down these conditions:\n\n1. (b - 1) divides (k\u00b2 - k) \u2192 (b - 1) | (k\u00b2 - k)\n2. 1 \u2264 a = (k\u00b2 - k)/(b - 1) \u2264 b - 1\n3. c = k - a must satisfy 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, for each base b, I need to find all integers k such that the above conditions are satisfied, and count the number of such n = k\u00b2, which are b-eautiful.\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest b where the number of such n exceeds 10.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nSince I need to find the smallest b, I can start checking bases starting from b=2 upwards until I find one with more than ten b-eautiful numbers.\n\nBut this might be time-consuming, so perhaps I can find a smarter way.\n\nLet me analyze the equation:\na = (k\u00b2 - k)/(b - 1)\nSo, since a must be a positive integer (since it's a digit in the two-digit number), (b - 1) must divide (k\u00b2 - k).\n\nLet me denote d = b - 1. So, d divides k\u00b2 - k, which is k(k - 1). Therefore, d must be a divisor of k(k - 1).\n\nSince k and k - 1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, d must be a product of factors from k and k - 1.\n\nBut d = b - 1, which is \u22651 for b \u22652.\n\nAlso, since a must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b - 1, which is 1 \u2264 a \u2264 d.\n\nGiven that a = (k\u00b2 - k)/d, so (k\u00b2 - k)/d must be \u2264 d.\n\nSo,\n(k\u00b2 - k)/d \u2264 d\n=> k\u00b2 - k \u2264 d\u00b2\nBut since d = b -1, and b is the base, which for a two-digit number must be at least 2 (so d \u22651), but for a two-digit number, the maximum n is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b\u00b2 -1.

So, k = sqrt(n) must satisfy sqrt(b) \u2264 k \u2264 sqrt(b\u00b2 -1). Since sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) is just a bit less than b, so k can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 -1)). But since n is a perfect square, k must be integer, so k ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 -1)).\n\nBut perhaps more importantly, since n is a two-digit number in base b, n is between b and b\u00b2 -1. So, k\u00b2 is between b and b\u00b2 -1. Therefore:\n\nsqrt(b) \u2264 k \u2264 sqrt(b\u00b2 -1)\nWhich is roughly:\nb^{1/2} \u2264 k \u2264 b - \u03b5, where \u03b5 is a small positive number.\n\nBut since k is an integer, k can range from the smallest integer greater than or equal to sqrt(b) up to b -1. Because when k = b, k\u00b2 = b\u00b2, which is a three-digit number in base b (since b\u00b2 in base b is written as 100_b), so k can't be equal to b.",

Yes. a=(400 -20)/20=380/20=19. c=20Okay, so I have this problem here about b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand it step by step. \n\nThe problem says that for an integer b \u2265 2, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. \n\nThe example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because 81 in base 13 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and the digits 6 and 3 add up to 9, which is the square root of 81. That makes sense.\n\nThe question asks for the least integer b (b \u2265 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, I need to find the smallest base b such that there are more than ten numbers n that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nLet me break down what it means for n to be a two-digit number in base b. In any base b, a two-digit number is of the form d1 * b + d0, where d1 and d0 are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, d1 can't be zero. Also, both digits must satisfy 0 \u2264 d1, d0 \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, n = d1 * b + d0. The sum of the digits is s = d1 + d0. The condition is that s = sqrt(n). Therefore, s must be an integer because the square root of n must be an integer for the sum of the digits to equal it. So, n must be a perfect square.\n\nSo, n = s\u00b2, and s = d1 + d0. Also, n = d1 * b + d0. So, substituting n with s\u00b2, we have:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1 * b + d0.\n\nBut since s = d1 + d0, we can express d0 as s - d1. Let me substitute that into the equation:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1 * b + (s - d1).\n\nSimplify this equation:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1 * b + s - d1  \ns\u00b2 = d1*(b - 1) + s.\n\nLet me rearrange the terms to solve for d1:\n\nd1*(b - 1) = s\u00b2 - s  \nd1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1).\n\nSo, d1 must be an integer because it's a digit in base b. Also, since d1 is a digit, it must satisfy 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b - 1 (since d1 can't be zero in a two-digit number).\n\nSimilarly, d0 = s - d1 must satisfy 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b - 1. So, d0 must be a non-negative integer less than b.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each base b, find all possible s such that:\n\n1. s is a positive integer (since s = d1 + d0, and d1 \u2265 1, d0 \u2265 0, s \u2265 1).\n\n2. The equation d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1) must yield an integer d1, and 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b - 1.\n\n3. Then, d0 = s - d1 must satisfy 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, for each base b, we can compute possible s values, check if (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and then verify if d1 and d0 are valid digits.\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest b where the number of such n (which correspond to valid s) is more than ten.\n\nSo, how do we approach this? Let's think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, for a given b, we can find all possible s by considering the possible values of s\u00b2 = n, which is a two-digit number in base b. So, n must be between b (the smallest two-digit number in base b, which is 10_b = b) and (b\u00b2 - 1) (the largest two-digit number in base b, which is (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b\u00b2 - 1).\n\nTherefore, n must satisfy b \u2264 n \u2264 b\u00b2 - 1. Since n = s\u00b2, we have b \u2264 s\u00b2 \u2264 b\u00b2 - 1.\n\nTaking square roots: sqrt(b) \u2264 s \u2264 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1). But sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1) is just slightly less than b. So, s can range from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1)).\n\nBut since s must be an integer, s can range from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b - 1, because sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1) is less than b.",

But in the example, s was 9, which is within that range.\n\nSo, for each base b, the possible s values are integers from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b - 1.\n\nFor each s in that range, we can compute d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1). If d1 is an integer, and 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b - 1, and d0 = s - d1 is between 0 and b - 1, then n = s\u00b2 is a b-eautiful number.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. For each base b starting from 2 upwards:\n\n   a. Compute the range of s: s_min = ceil(sqrt(b)), s_max = b - 1.\n\n   b. For each s from s_min to s_max:\n\n      i.

If both d1 and d0 are valid, then n = s\u00b2 is a b-eautiful number.\n\n2. Count how many such n exist for each b. The first b where the count exceeds 10 is our answer.\n\nBut since we're looking for the smallest such b, we can increment b starting from 2 and compute the count for each until we find one with more than ten b-eautiful numbers.\n\nThis seems computationally intensive but manageable. However, since this is a problem-solving scenario, perhaps we can find a smarter way to find the minimal b without checking each one step by step.",
          "text2": "Another example: let's say b = 10. Then, n must be a two-digit number, from 10 to 99. So sqrt(n) must be from 4 (since sqrt(10) ~3.16, so the next integer is 4) up to 9. So, s can be 4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nHmm, so for each base b, s can take integer values starting from the ceiling of sqrt(b) up to (b-1), inclusive. So, if I fix b, I can iterate s from ceil(sqrt(b)) to (b-1), compute d1 as (s^2 - s)/(b -1), and check if d1 is an integer within [1, b-1], and then d0 = s - d1 is also within [0, b-1).\n\nSo, for each b, the number of possible s values is (b - 1) - ceil(sqrt(b)) + 1 = b - ceil(sqrt(b)).\n\nBut not all s will lead to valid d1 and d0. So, the number of b-eautiful integers for a given b is the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b - 1] such that (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b -1), and the resulting d1 is an integer in [1, b-1), and d0 = s - d1 is in [0, b-1).\n\nSo, the problem is to find the smallest b \u2265 2 such that the number of such s (and hence the number of n) is more than ten.\n\nSo, the strategy is:\n\n1. For each b starting from 2 upwards:\n\n   a. Determine the range of s: from s_min = ceil(sqrt(b)) to s_max = b -1.\n\n   b. For each s in s_min to s_max:\n\n      i. Compute (s^2 - s). If this is divisible by (b - 1), then compute d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b -1).\n\n      ii. Check if d1 is an integer between 1 and (b -1), and d0 = s - d1 is between 0 and (b -1).\n\n      iii. If both conditions are satisfied, then n = d1*b + d0 is a b-eautiful number.\n\n   c. Count how many such n exist for each b. When the count exceeds 10, we've found our answer.\n\nBut since b can be up to, say, 100 or more, we need an efficient way to compute this. But since the problem is asking for the smallest b where there are more than ten such numbers, maybe we can find a pattern or formula to compute the number of solutions for each b without having to iterate s for each b.",

Therefore, k <= b-1, because (b)^2 is b^2, which is not less than b^2, but n is less than b^2, so k can be up to b-1.\n\nSo, k ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1.\n\nSo, for each base b, I can iterate k from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1, and for each k, see if there exist digits a and c in base b such that:\n\n1. a + c = k\n2. a*b + c = k^2.\n\nSo, substituting a + c = k, we can express c = k - a.

Hmm, let me try to understand what a b-eautiful number is first.\n\nFrom the problem statement, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:\n1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits.\n2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.\n\nAn example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because when you write 81 in base 13, it's 63_13, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81.\n\nAlright, so I need to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such numbers n. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's represent n in base b. If n is a two-digit number in base b, it can be written as:\nn = a * b + c\nHere, a and c are the digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero. Also, in base b, the digits a and c must satisfy 0 \u2264 a, c \u2264 b-1.\n\nThe second condition is that the sum of the digits equals the square root of n. So,\na + c = sqrt(n)\n\nSince sqrt(n) must be an integer because a and c are integers, n must be a perfect square. Let me denote sqrt(n) as k, where k is a positive integer. Therefore,\nn = k\u00b2\nAnd from the first equation,\nk = a + c\nSubstituting into n's equation:\nk\u00b2 = a * b + c\n\nSo, substituting c from the second equation into the first gives:\nk\u00b2 = a * b + (k - a)\nWhich simplifies to:\nk\u00b2 = a * b + k - a\nLet me rearrange terms:\nk\u00b2 - k = a * (b - 1)\nSo, a = (k\u00b2 - k) / (b - 1)\n\nNow, since a must be a digit in base b, it must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b - 1. Similarly, c = k - a must also satisfy 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, I can express a in terms of k and b:\na = (k\u00b2 - k)/(b - 1)\nWhich implies that (k\u00b2 - k) must be divisible by (b - 1) for a to be an integer.\n\nTherefore, (b - 1) must be a divisor of (k\u00b2 - k). Also, since a must be at least 1, (k\u00b2 - k)/(b - 1) \u2265 1.\n\nLet me write down these conditions:\n\n1. (b - 1) divides (k\u00b2 - k) \u2192 (b - 1) | (k\u00b2 - k)\n2. 1 \u2264 a = (k\u00b2 - k)/(b - 1) \u2264 b - 1\n3. c = k - a must satisfy 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, for each base b, I need to find all integers k such that the above conditions are satisfied, and count the number of such n = k\u00b2, which are b-eautiful.\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest b where the number of such n exceeds 10.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nSince I need to find the smallest b, I can start checking bases starting from b=2 upwards until I find one with more than ten b-eautiful numbers.\n\nBut this might be time-consuming, so perhaps I can find a smarter way.\n\nLet me analyze the equation:\na = (k\u00b2 - k)/(b - 1)\nSo, since a must be a positive integer (since it's a digit in the two-digit number), (b - 1) must divide (k\u00b2 - k).\n\nLet me denote d = b - 1. So, d divides k\u00b2 - k, which is k(k - 1). Therefore, d must be a divisor of k(k - 1).\n\nSince k and k - 1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, d must be a product of factors from k and k - 1.\n\nBut d = b - 1, which is \u22651 for b \u22652.\n\nAlso, since a must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b - 1, which is 1 \u2264 a \u2264 d.\n\nGiven that a = (k\u00b2 - k)/d, so (k\u00b2 - k)/d must be \u2264 d.\n\nSo,\n(k\u00b2 - k)/d \u2264 d\n=> k\u00b2 - k \u2264 d\u00b2\nBut since d = b -1, and b is the base, which for a two-digit number must be at least 2 (so d \u22651), but for a two-digit number, the maximum n is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b\u00b2 -1. Therefore, the maximum k is sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) \u2248 b.\n\nBut let's think about constraints on k.\n\nSince n is a two-digit number in base b, n must satisfy b \u2264 n \u2264 b\u00b2 -1. So, k = sqrt(n) must satisfy sqrt(b) \u2264 k \u2264 sqrt(b\u00b2 -1). Since sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) is just a bit less than b, so k can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 -1)). But since n is a perfect square, k must be integer, so k ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 -1)).\n\nBut perhaps more importantly, since n is a two-digit number in base b, n is between b and b\u00b2 -1. So, k\u00b2 is between b and b\u00b2 -1. Therefore:\n\nsqrt(b) \u2264 k \u2264 sqrt(b\u00b2 -1)\nWhich is roughly:\nb^{1/2} \u2264 k \u2264 b - \u03b5, where \u03b5 is a small positive number.\n\nBut since k is an integer, k can range from the smallest integer greater than or equal to sqrt(b) up to b -1. Because when k = b, k\u00b2 = b\u00b2, which is a three-digit number in base b (since b\u00b2 in base b is written as 100_b), so k can't be equal to b.",

Since s = d1 + d0, then d0 = s - d1.\n\nLet me substitute d0 with s - d1 in the equation:\n\nd1*b + (s - d1) = s^2.\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\nd1*b + s - d1 = s^2.\n\nFactor out d1 from the first and third term:\n\nd1*(b - 1) + s = s^2.\n\nNow, rearranging:\n\nd1*(b - 1) = s^2 - s.\n\nSo,\n\nd1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1).\n\nBut d1 has to be a digit in base b, meaning that 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b - 1 (since it's the leading digit, it can't be zero). Similarly, d0 is also a digit in base b, so 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b - 1. But since d0 = s - d1, and d0 has to be non-negative, s must be at least d1, so s \u2265 d1.\n\nSo, d1 must be a positive integer such that 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b -1.\n\nAlso, from d0 = s - d1, and d0 must be less than b:\n\ns - d1 \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, s \u2264 d1 + b -1.\n\nBut since s = d1 + d0, and d0 is non-negative, s is at least d1. So s can range from d1 to d1 + (b -1).\n\nBut let's think about s. Since s is the sum of two digits in base b, each digit being less than b, so the maximum possible s is (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2.\n\nBut the square of s is equal to the number n, which is a two-digit number in base b.

So, n must be a two-digit number in base b, which means in decimal, n is between b^1 and b^2 - 1. More precisely, n is equal to a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b.
