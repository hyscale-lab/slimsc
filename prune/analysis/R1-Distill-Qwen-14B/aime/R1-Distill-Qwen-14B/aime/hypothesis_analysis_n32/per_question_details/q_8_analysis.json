Similarly for b and c.\n\nSo the total sum is a\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c = 300, and Q = ab + bc + ca.

So, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 300\u00b2 - 2Q = 90,000 - 2Q.\n\nSimilarly, as I wrote before, a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = S\u00b3 - 3SQ + 3P. So that's 300\u00b3 - 3*300*Q + 3P = 27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P.\n\nNow, going back to the equation:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000.\n\nSubstituting the expressions I have:\n\n300*(90,000 - 2Q) - (27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P) = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, 300*(90,000 - 2Q) = 300*90,000 - 300*2Q = 27,000,000 - 600Q.\n\nThen, subtracting (27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P):\n\nSo,\n\n[27,000,000 - 600Q] - [27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P] = 6,000,000.\n\nExpanding the subtraction:\n\n27,000,000 - 600Q - 27,000,000 + 900Q - 3P = 6,000,000.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(27,000,000 - 27,000,000) + (-600Q + 900Q) - 3P = 6,000,000.\n\nSo that's 0 + 300Q - 3P = 6,000,000.\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n100Q - P = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, 100Q - P = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, P = 100Q - 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, so P is equal to 100Q minus 2,000,000.\n\nBut since P = abc and Q = ab + bc + ca, this gives a relation between abc and ab + bc + ca.\n\nNow, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, Q can be 0 up to certain values.

Let's compute 300\u00b3: 300*300=90,000; 90,000*300=27,000,000.\n\nSo, 300\u00b3 is 27,000,000. Then, 3*300 is 900, so 3*300*S2 is 900S2.

Maybe it's helpful to think of variables a, b, c in terms of their possible distributions.\n\nSince a, b, c are nonnegative integers, and their sum is 300, we can imagine that each of them can vary from 0 to 300, with the sum fixed at 300.\n\nBut the second equation is a bit tricky.

So that's 300\u00b3 - 3*300*Q + 3P = 27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P.\n\nNow, going back to the equation:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000.\n\nSubstituting the expressions I have:\n\n300*(90,000 - 2Q) - (27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P) = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, 300*(90,000 - 2Q) = 300*90,000 - 300*2Q = 27,000,000 - 600Q.\n\nThen, subtracting (27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P):\n\nSo,\n\n[27,000,000 - 600Q] - [27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P] = 6,000,000.\n\nExpanding the subtraction:\n\n27,000,000 - 600Q - 27,000,000 + 900Q - 3P = 6,000,000.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(27,000,000 - 27,000,000) + (-600Q + 900Q) - 3P = 6,000,000.\n\nSo that's 0 + 300Q - 3P = 6,000,000.\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n100Q - P = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, 100Q - P = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, P = 100Q - 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, so P is equal to 100Q minus 2,000,000.\n\nBut since P = abc and Q = ab + bc + ca, this gives a relation between abc and ab + bc + ca.\n\nNow, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, Q can be 0 up to certain values. But given that a + b + c = 300, Q can't be too large.",

          "text2": "But wait, since c = 300 - 2a, substitute that in:\na\u00b2 + a(300 - 2a) + (300 - 2a)^2 = 3,000,000 / a.\n\nLet me compute each term:\na\u00b2 is just a\u00b2.\na(300 - 2a) is 300a - 2a\u00b2.\n(300 - 2a)^2 is 90000 - 1200a + 4a\u00b2.\n\nNow, summing all these:\na\u00b2 + (300a - 2a\u00b2) + (90000 - 1200a + 4a\u00b2) = (a\u00b2 - 2a\u00b2 + 4a\u00b2) + (300a - 1200a) + 90000.\n\nSimplify:\n(3a\u00b2) + (-900a) + 90000.\n\nSo, 3a\u00b2 - 900a + 90000 = 3,000,000 / a.\n\nMultiply both sides by a to eliminate the denominator:\n3a\u00b3 - 900a\u00b2 + 90000a = 3,000,000.\n\nDivide both sides by 3 to simplify:\na\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0.\n\nHmm, that's a cubic equation. Let me write it as:\na\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0.\n\nI need to find integer solutions for a here. Let's try to factor this or find rational roots.\n\nUsing Rational Root Theorem, possible roots are factors of 1,000,000 divided by factors of 1 (since leading coefficient is 1). So possible integer roots are divisors of 1,000,000. That's a lot, but maybe we can think of a reasonable a. Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers adding to 300, a can be at most 150 (since 2a <=300). So trying a in that range.\n\nLet me test a = 100:\n100\u00b3 - 300*(100)^2 + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000\n= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0. Oh, that works! So a=100 is a root.\n\nSo, (a - 100) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or factor it out.\n\nDivide the cubic by (a - 100). Using synthetic division:\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -300 | 30,000 | -1,000,000\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by 100: 100. Add to -300: -200.\n\nMultiply -200 by 100: -20,000. Add to 30,000: 10,000.\n\nMultiply 10,000 by 100: 1,000,000. Add to -1,000,000: 0.\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000) = 0.\n\nNow, set each factor to zero:\n\na - 100 = 0 => a = 100.\n\na\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000 = 0.\n\nLet me solve the quadratic equation:\na = [200 \u00b1 sqrt(40,000 - 40,000)] / 2 = [200 \u00b1 0]/2 = 100.\n\nSo the cubic has a double root at a = 100.\n\nSo the only solution when a = b is a = 100, and since a + b + c = 300, c = 300 - 2a = 300 - 200 = 100.\n\nSo, one solution is (100, 100, 100).",

Number of triples where a = 100: Then b + c = 200. The number of nonnegative integer solutions is C(200 + 2 -1, 2 -1) = C(201, 1) = 201.\n\nSimilarly, for b = 100: a + c = 200. Solutions: 201.\n\nSimilarly, for c = 100: a + b = 200. Solutions: 201.\n\nSo, total for each case: 201.\n\nBut if we just add them, we get 201 * 3 = 603.\n\nBut this counts the cases where two variables are 100 twice, so we need to subtract those.\n\n2. Number of triples where a = 100 and b = 100: Then c = 300 - 100 - 100 = 100. So, c = 100. So, only one such triple: (100, 100, 100).\n\nSimilarly, for a = 100 and c = 100, we get b = 100.\n\nAnd for b = 100 and c = 100, we get a = 100.\n\nSo, each pair (a=100, b=100), (a=100, c=100), (b=100, c=100) contributes 1 triple. So, 3 cases in total.\n\nSo, we subtract these 3 cases because they were counted twice in the initial count.\n\nSo, 603 - 3 = 600.",

Using synthetic division:\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -300 | 30,000 | -1,000,000\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by 100: 100. Add to -300: -200.\n\nMultiply -200 by 100: -20,000.

Let's see if we can find a root by testing.\n\nLet me try a = 100:\n\n100\u00b3 = 1,000,000.\n\n-300*(100)^2 = -300*10,000 = -3,000,000.\n\n+30,000*100 = 3,000,000.\n\nSum: 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 = 1,000,000.\n\nSo, a = 100 is a root.\n\nSo, we can factor (a - 100) from the cubic polynomial.\n\nPerforming polynomial division or using synthetic division.\n\nDivide a\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 by (a - 100).\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\n100 | 1   -300    30,000   -1,000,000\n\n          100    -20,000     1,000,000\n\n      1    -200    10,000         0\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000) = 0.\n\nNow, set the quadratic equal to zero:\n\na\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000 = 0.\n\nUse quadratic formula:\n\na = [200 \u00b1 sqrt(200\u00b2 - 4*1*10,000)] / 2\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n200\u00b2 = 40,000.\n\n4*1*10,000 = 40,000.\n\nSo, discriminant is 40,000 - 40,000 = 0.\n\nThus, a = [200]/2 = 100. So, a = 100 is a double root.\n\nSo, the cubic equation has a triple root at a = 100.",
          "text2": "Wait, let's think numerically. Let me see what happens when a = b = c = 100. Then, Q = 3*(100*100) = 30,000. P = 100*30,000 - 2,000,000 = 3,000,000 - 2,000,000 = 1,000,000. So, abc = 100*100*100 = 1,000,000. That matches. So, (100,100,100) is a solution.\n\nAre there other solutions where two variables are equal?\n\nLet me assume a = b. Then, c = 300 - 2a.\n\nCompute Q and P in terms of a.\n\nSo, Q = ab + bc + ca = a\u00b2 + 2a c = a\u00b2 + 2a(300 - 2a) = a\u00b2 + 600a -4a\u00b2 = -3a\u00b2 + 600a.\n\nSimilarly, P = abc = a\u00b2 c = a\u00b2 (300 - 2a).\n\nAnd from earlier, P = 100Q - 2,000,000.\n\nSo let's substitute:\n\na\u00b2 (300 - 2a) = 100*(-3a\u00b2 + 600a) - 2,000,000\n\nCompute the right side:\n\n= -300a\u00b2 + 60,000a - 2,000,000\n\nLeft side: 300a\u00b2 - 2a\u00b3\n\nSo, equation:\n\n300a\u00b2 - 2a\u00b3 = -300a\u00b2 + 60,000a - 2,000,000\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n300a\u00b2 - 2a\u00b3 + 300a\u00b2 - 60,000a + 2,000,000 = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(300a\u00b2 + 300a\u00b2) = 600a\u00b2\n\n-2a\u00b3 remains\n\n-60,000a remains\n\n+ 2,000,000 remains\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n-2a\u00b3 + 600a\u00b2 - 60,000a + 2,000,000 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive:\n\n2a\u00b3 - 600a\u00b2 + 60,000a - 2,000,000 = 0\n\nDivide all terms by 2 to simplify:\n\na\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0\n\nHmm, that's a cubic equation in a.

Yes, a = 100 is a root.\n\nSo, (a - 100) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division.\n\nDivide a\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 by (a - 100).\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\n100 | 1   -300    30000    -1000000\n\n          100    -20000     1000000\n\n      1    -200     10000          0\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000) = 0.\n\nNow, set each factor to zero:\n\na = 100\n\nOr a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000 = 0\n\nSolve the quadratic equation:\n\na = [200 \u00b1 sqrt(200\u00b2 - 4*1*10,000)] / 2\n\nCalculate discriminant:\n\n200\u00b2 - 40,000 = 40,000 - 40,000 = 0\n\nSo, a = [200 \u00b1 0]/2 = 100\n\nThus, the only real root is a = 100. So, when a = b, the only solution is a = b = c = 100.",

Let's try to factor this or find rational roots.\n\nUsing Rational Root Theorem, possible roots are factors of 1,000,000 divided by factors of 1 (since leading coefficient is 1). So possible integer roots are divisors of 1,000,000. That's a lot, but maybe we can think of a reasonable a. Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers adding to 300, a can be at most 150 (since 2a <=300).

So a=100 is a root.\n\nSo, (a - 100) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or factor it out.\n\nDivide the cubic by (a - 100). Using synthetic division:\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -300 | 30,000 | -1,000,000\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by 100: 100. Add to -300: -200.\n\nMultiply -200 by 100: -20,000.

Add to -1,000,000: 0.\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000) = 0.\n\nNow, set each factor to zero:\n\na - 100 = 0 => a = 100.\n\na\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000 = 0.\n\nLet me solve the quadratic equation:\na = [200 \u00b1 sqrt(40,000 - 40,000)] / 2 = [200 \u00b1 0]/2 = 100.\n\nSo the cubic has a double root at a = 100.\n\nSo the only solution when a = b is a = 100, and since a + b + c = 300, c = 300 - 2a = 300 - 200 = 100.\n\nSo, one solution is (100, 100, 100).",

Add to -1,000,000: 0.\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000) = 0.\n\nNow, set each factor equal to zero:\n\na = 100, or a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000 = 0.\n\nSolve the quadratic equation:\n\na = [200 \u00b1 sqrt(40,000 - 40,000)] / 2 = [200 \u00b1 0]/2 = 100.\n\nSo, the only solution is a=100. So, in this case, a = b = 100, which leads to c=300 - 2a = 100. So, that's the same as the first case where all variables are equal. So, Case 2 doesn't give any new solutions beyond the triple where all are 100.\n\nCase 3: One variable is zero, and the other two are positive. Let's suppose c = 0, so a + b = 300.\n\nThen, the second equation becomes:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2*0 + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2*0 + 0\u00b2a + 0\u00b2b = a\u00b2b + b\u00b2a = 6,000,000.\n\nFactor out ab:\n\nab(a + b) = 6,000,000.\n\nBut since a + b = 300, we have:\n\nab * 300 = 6,000,000 => ab = 6,000,000 / 300 = 20,000.\n\nSo, ab = 20,000, and a + b = 300.\n\nWe need to find the number of nonnegative integer solutions (a, b) where a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000.\n\nLet me set a and b as roots of the quadratic equation x\u00b2 - 300x + 20,000 = 0.\n\nCompute the discriminant: D = 300\u00b2 - 4*1*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000.\n\nsqrt(D) = 100.\n\nSo, solutions are x = [300 \u00b1 100]/2 = (400)/2 = 200, or (200)/2 = 100.\n\nSo, the solutions are a=200, b=100 and a=100, b=200.

So a=100 is a root.\n\nSo, (a - 100) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or factor it out.\n\nDivide the cubic by (a - 100). Using synthetic division:\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -300 | 30,000 | -1,000,000\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by 100: 100. Add to -300: -200.\n\nMultiply -200 by 100: -20,000. Add to 30,000: 10,000.\n\nMultiply 10,000 by 100: 1,000,000. Add to -1,000,000: 0.\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000) = 0.\n\nNow, set each factor to zero:\n\na - 100 = 0 => a = 100.\n\na\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000 = 0.\n\nLet me solve the quadratic equation:\na = [200 \u00b1 sqrt(40,000 - 40,000)] / 2 = [200 \u00b1 0]/2 = 100.\n\nSo the cubic has a double root at a = 100.\n\nSo the only solution when a = b is a = 100, and since a + b + c = 300, c = 300 - 2a = 300 - 200 = 100.\n\nSo, one solution is (100, 100, 100).",

But from earlier, we have Q \u2265 20,000 due to P being nonnegative.\n\nSo Q must be between 20,000 and 30,000.\n\nSo, 20,000 \u2264 Q \u2264 30,000.\n\nAnd P = 100Q - 2,000,000.\n\nSince Q is between 20,000 and 30,000, P will be between 0 and 100*30,000 - 2,000,000 = 3,000,000 - 2,000,000 = 1,000,000.\n\nSo P is between 0 and 1,000,000.\n\nBut P is also abc, which is the product of three nonnegative integers a, b, c adding up to 300.\n\nSo, now, I think we can model this as a system where we have S = 300, Q = ab + bc + ca, P = abc, with Q \u2265 20,000 and P = 100Q - 2,000,000.\n\nI need to find the number of triples (a, b, c) such that these conditions hold.",

Using synthetic division:\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -300 | 30,000 | -1,000,000\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by 100: 100. Add to -300: -200.\n\nMultiply -200 by 100: -20,000.

          "text2": "Wait, but let's verify.

Then, bc = 20,000 and b + c = 300. So, same as before, b and c can be 200 and 100 or 100 and 200. So, for a=0, we have two solutions: (0,200,100) and (0,100,200). Similarly, for b=0, we have two solutions: (200,0,100) and (100,0,200). And for c=0, two solutions: (200,100,0) and (100,200,0).\n\nSo, in total, 3 positions for 0, each contributing 2 solutions, so 6 triples where exactly one variable is 0, and the other two are 200 and 100.\n\nNow, let's check if these are valid. Let's pick one, say (200,100,0). Compute the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\n= (200)^2*100 + (200)^2*0 + (100)^2*200 + (100)^2*0 + 0^2*200 + 0^2*100\n\n= 40,000*100 + 0 + 10,000*200 + 0 + 0 + 0\n\n= 4,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 6,000,000. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for (100,200,0):\n\n= 100\u00b2*200 + 100\u00b2*0 + 200\u00b2*100 + 200\u00b2*0 + 0\u00b2*100 + 0\u00b2*200\n\n= 10,000*200 + 0 + 40,000*100 + 0 + 0 + 0\n\n= 2,000,000 + 4,000,000 = 6,000,000. Correct.\n\nSo, these 6 triples are valid.\n\nNow, are there any other triples where one variable is zero? Let me see. Suppose two variables are zero, say b = c = 0. Then, a = 300. Let's compute the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 300\u00b2*0 + 300\u00b2*0 + 0\u00b2*300 + 0\u00b2*0 + 0\u00b2*300 + 0\u00b2*0 = 0. Which is not equal to 6,000,000. So, no solutions in this case.\n\nSo, all triples with two variables zero are invalid.\n\nSo, so far, I have 6 triples where one variable is zero, and the other two are 200 and 100 in some order.\n\nPlus the triple where all variables are 100, which gives 1 solution.",

Using synthetic division:\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -300 | 30,000 | -1,000,000\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by 100: 100. Add to -300: -200.\n\nMultiply -200 by 100: -20,000.

Let's try to factor this or find rational roots.\n\nUsing Rational Root Theorem, possible roots are factors of 1,000,000 divided by factors of 1 (since leading coefficient is 1). So possible integer roots are divisors of 1,000,000. That's a lot, but maybe we can think of a reasonable a. Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers adding to 300, a can be at most 150 (since 2a <=300).

So a=100 is a root.\n\nSo, (a - 100) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or factor it out.\n\nDivide the cubic by (a - 100). Using synthetic division:\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -300 | 30,000 | -1,000,000\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by 100: 100. Add to -300: -200.\n\nMultiply -200 by 100: -20,000.

So possible integer roots are divisors of 1,000,000. That's a lot, but maybe we can think of a reasonable a. Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers adding to 300, a can be at most 150 (since 2a <=300).

So a=100 is a root.\n\nSo, (a - 100) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or factor it out.\n\nDivide the cubic by (a - 100). Using synthetic division:\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -300 | 30,000 | -1,000,000\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by 100: 100. Add to -300: -200.\n\nMultiply -200 by 100: -20,000.

Add to -1,000,000: 0.\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000) = 0.\n\nNow, set each factor to zero:\n\na - 100 = 0 => a = 100.\n\na\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000 = 0.\n\nLet me solve the quadratic equation:\na = [200 \u00b1 sqrt(40,000 - 40,000)] / 2 = [200 \u00b1 0]/2 = 100.\n\nSo the cubic has a double root at a = 100.\n\nSo the only solution when a = b is a = 100, and since a + b + c = 300, c = 300 - 2a = 300 - 200 = 100.\n\nSo, one solution is (100, 100, 100).",

So, indeed:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nSo, using that, our equation becomes:\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nWe know that a + b + c = 300, so substituting:\n\n300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nDivide both sides by 3 to simplify:\n\n100*(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, 100*(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, that's a bit simpler. So, the equation now is:\n\n100*(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nI need to find nonnegative integers a, b, c such that a + b + c = 300 and 100*(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, perhaps we can assume some ordering, like a \u2265 b \u2265 c, to reduce the number of cases. Or maybe express two variables in terms of the third using the sum equation.",

So, at least one of a, b, c is equal to 100.\n\nAh! So, this is a crucial insight. So, in the case where none of a, b, c is zero, we must have at least one of them equal to 100.\n\nSo, the solutions are either:\n\n1. One of a, b, c is zero, and the other two satisfy a + b = 300 and ab =20,000, which gives the six triples we found earlier.\n\n2. None of a, b, c is zero, but at least one is 100.\n\nSo, now, let's consider the case where at least one of a, b, c is 100, and the others are positive integers.\n\nSo, let's consider different cases.\n\nCase 1: Exactly one of a, b, c is 100.\n\nSubcase 1a: a=100. Then, b + c=200.\n\nWe also have the second equation: 100\u00b2*b +100\u00b2*c +b\u00b2*100 +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2*100 +c\u00b2b =6,000,000.",

So, the problem reduces to finding all triples (a, b, c) where at least one is 100, and a + b + c=300, and the second equation is satisfied.\n\nBut since a + b + c=300, if one of them is 100, the sum of the other two is 200.\n\nSo, let me consider cases where:\n\nCase 1: a=100.

Then, perhaps I can find expressions for a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 and a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 in terms of S, Q, and P.\n\nYes, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2Q. So, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 300\u00b2 - 2Q = 90,000 - 2Q.\n\nSimilarly, as I wrote before, a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = S\u00b3 - 3SQ + 3P. So that's 300\u00b3 - 3*300*Q + 3P = 27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P.\n\nNow, going back to the equation:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000.\n\nSubstituting the expressions I have:\n\n300*(90,000 - 2Q) - (27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P) = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, 300*(90,000 - 2Q) = 300*90,000 - 300*2Q = 27,000,000 - 600Q.\n\nThen, subtracting (27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P):\n\nSo,\n\n[27,000,000 - 600Q] - [27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P] = 6,000,000.\n\nExpanding the subtraction:\n\n27,000,000 - 600Q - 27,000,000 + 900Q - 3P = 6,000,000.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(27,000,000 - 27,000,000) + (-600Q + 900Q) - 3P = 6,000,000.\n\nSo that's 0 + 300Q - 3P = 6,000,000.\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n100Q - P = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, 100Q - P = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, P = 100Q - 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, so P is equal to 100Q minus 2,000,000.\n\nBut since P = abc and Q = ab + bc + ca, this gives a relation between abc and ab + bc + ca.\n\nNow, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, Q can be 0 up to certain values. But given that a + b + c = 300, Q can't be too large.",

So, a=100 is a root.\n\nTherefore, (a - 100) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or factor it out.\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -300 | 30,000 | -1,000,000\n\nDivide by (a - 100):\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by 100: 100.

Add to -1,000,000: 0.\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000) = 0.\n\nNow, set each factor equal to zero:\n\na = 100, or a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000 = 0.\n\nSolve the quadratic equation:\n\na = [200 \u00b1 sqrt(40,000 - 40,000)] / 2 = [200 \u00b1 0]/2 = 100.\n\nSo, the only solution is a=100. So, in this case, a = b = 100, which leads to c=300 - 2a = 100. So, that's the same as the first case where all variables are equal. So, Case 2 doesn't give any new solutions beyond the triple where all are 100.\n\nCase 3: One variable is zero, and the other two are positive. Let's suppose c = 0, so a + b = 300.\n\nThen, the second equation becomes:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2*0 + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2*0 + 0\u00b2a + 0\u00b2b = a\u00b2b + b\u00b2a = 6,000,000.\n\nFactor out ab:\n\nab(a + b) = 6,000,000.\n\nBut since a + b = 300, we have:\n\nab * 300 = 6,000,000 => ab = 6,000,000 / 300 = 20,000.\n\nSo, ab = 20,000, and a + b = 300.\n\nWe need to find the number of nonnegative integer solutions (a, b) where a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000.\n\nLet me set a and b as roots of the quadratic equation x\u00b2 - 300x + 20,000 = 0.\n\nCompute the discriminant: D = 300\u00b2 - 4*1*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000.\n\nsqrt(D) = 100.\n\nSo, solutions are x = [300 \u00b1 100]/2 = (400)/2 = 200, or (200)/2 = 100.\n\nSo, the solutions are a=200, b=100 and a=100, b=200. Since a and b are nonnegative integers, these are valid.\n\nSo, when c=0, the possible triples are (200, 100, 0) and (100, 200, 0).",

Let me check:\n\nab(a + b) = a\u00b2b + ab\u00b2\nSimilarly, bc(b + c) = b\u00b2c + bc\u00b2\nAnd ac(a + c) = a\u00b2c + ac\u00b2\n\nIf I add these together, I get a\u00b2b + ab\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + bc\u00b2 + a\u00b2c + ac\u00b2, which is exactly the left-hand side of the second equation. So, that means the second equation can be written as:\n\nab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ac(a + c) = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, that might be useful. But how? Let me think.\n\nSince a + b + c = 300, I can express (a + b) as (300 - c), right? Because c = 300 - a - b. Similarly, (b + c) = 300 - a and (a + c) = 300 - b.\n\nSo substituting these into the second equation, we get:\n\nab(300 - c) + bc(300 - a) + ac(300 - b) = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me expand each term:\n\nab * 300 - ab c + bc * 300 - bc a + ac * 300 - ac b = 6,000,000.\n\nSo that's 300ab + 300bc + 300ac - abc - abc - abc = 6,000,000.",

So, that's another way to write the second equation.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ac(a + c) = 6,000,000.\n\nBut since a + b + c = 300, then a + b = 300 - c, and similarly for the others.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nab*(300 - c) + bc*(300 - a) + ac*(300 - b) = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me expand each term:\n\nab*300 - abc + bc*300 - abc + ac*300 - abc.\n\nSo, combining like terms:\n\n300(ab + bc + ac) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nSo, now the equation becomes:\n\n300(ab + bc + ac) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nI can factor out a 3:\n\n3[100(ab + bc + ac) - abc] = 6,000,000.\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n100(ab + bc + ac) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nSo now, I have the equation:\n\n100(ab + bc + ac) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, that looks more manageable. Let's write it as:\n\n100(ab + bc + ac) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c = 300, P = abc, and Q = ab + bc + ac. So, the equation becomes:\n\n100Q - P = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, 100Q - P = 2,000,000.\n\nI also know from the theory of symmetric equations that for three variables, given S, Q, and P, these are the elementary symmetric sums. So, if I can find Q and P, I can perhaps find the number of triples (a, b, c) that satisfy these conditions.",
