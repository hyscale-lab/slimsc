Because 300 * cos\u03b8 is real, and 468i * i sin\u03b8 is 468i^2 sin\u03b8 = -468 sin\u03b8.

Let me make sure that when I converted the expression, I didn't miss any other terms. For instance, when I expanded both terms, did I correctly add the real parts and the imaginary parts?\n\nYes, because each term had a real and imaginary component, and when you add them together, you just add the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\n\nSo, the real part of the entire expression is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8, and the imaginary part is 276 sin\u03b8 +504 cos\u03b8.

Because 300 * cos\u03b8 is real, and 468i * i sin\u03b8 is 468i^2 sin\u03b8 = -468 sin\u03b8. Similarly, the imaginary part is 300 sin\u03b8 + 468 cos\u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, for the second term, (24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8), the real part is 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8, because 24 cos\u03b8 is real, 36i * (-i sin\u03b8) is 36 sin\u03b8 (since i*(-i) is 1). The imaginary part is (-24 sin\u03b8) + 36 cos\u03b8.\n\nAdding the real parts:\n\n300 cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8 +24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8 = (300 +24)cos\u03b8 + (-468 +36) sin\u03b8 = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, adding the imaginary parts: 300 sin\u03b8 +468 cos\u03b8 -24 sin\u03b8 +36 cos\u03b8 = (300 -24) sin\u03b8 + (468 +36) cos\u03b8 = 276 sin\u03b8 +504 cos\u03b8. But since we're looking for the real part, that's correct.\n\nSo, the real part is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8, whose maximum is sqrt(324^2 +432^2) = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600) = 540.\n\nSo, the maximum real part is 540.

So, 324^2 = 104,976.\n\nSimilarly, 432^2: Let's compute 400^2 = 160,000, 32^2=1,024, and 2*400*32=25,600. So, (400+32)^2 = 160,000 +25,600 + 1,024= 186,624.\n\nSo, 324^2 + 432^2 = 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600.\n\nSo, sqrt(291,600) = let me compute that. 540^2 = 291,600 because 500^2=250,000, 40^2=1,600, and 2*500*40=40,000. So, 540^2 = (500+40)^2 = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. So, sqrt(291,600) = 540.\n\nSo, the maximum value of Real(E) is 540.",

Let's see. 500^2=250,000; 540^2=291,600. Because 54^2=2916, so 540^2=291,600. So sqrt(291600) = 540.\n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is 540.",

I need to find the maximum value of this expression as \u03b8 varies.\n\nHmm, okay, so I've reduced the problem to maximizing 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. That's a real function of \u03b8, and I know that expressions of the form A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 can be rewritten as C cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where C is the amplitude. The maximum value is then C.\n\nSo, let me compute the maximum of 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nThe formula for the maximum value is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2), where A is the coefficient of cos\u03b8 and B is the coefficient of sin\u03b8.",
