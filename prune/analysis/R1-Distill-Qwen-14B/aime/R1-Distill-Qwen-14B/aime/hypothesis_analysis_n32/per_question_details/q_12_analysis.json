So, each column is a pair of digits that add to 9.\n\nSo, for example, in the given example:\n\nTop row: 0,0,8.\n\nBottom row:9,9,1.\n\nSo, 0+9=9, 0+9=9, 8+1=9. Yes, that fits.\n\nSo, each column sums to 9.\n\nSo, this is a key point. So, for each column i, the top digit plus the bottom digit equals 9.\n\nSo, that gives us constraints on the digits.\n\nNow, the second condition is ad + be + cf =99.\n\nSince a + d =9, let me express d=9 -a.\n\nSimilarly, e=9 -b,\n\nf=9 -c.\n\nSubstituting into the second condition:\n\nad + be + cf=99.\n\nSo, a*(9 - a) + b*(9 - b) + c*(9 - c) =99.\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\na*(9 -a) =9a -a\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, for b and c.\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\n(9a -a\u00b2) + (9b -b\u00b2) + (9c -c\u00b2) =99.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n9(a + b + c) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) =99.\n\nHmm, let's denote S =a + b + c.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n9S - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) =99.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =9S -99.\n\nWe need to find a, b, c such that:\n\na, b, c are digits (0-9),\n\na + d=9 => d=9 -a,\n\nb + e=9 => e=9 -b,\n\nc + f=9 => f=9 -c,\n\nand a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =9S -99, where S =a + b + c.\n\nSo, let me see. Since a, b, c are digits from 0 to 9, their sum S can range from 0 to 27.\n\nBut let's see, the equation a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =9S -99.\n\nSince a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 must be non-negative, 9S -99 \u22650 => S \u2265 11.\n\nSo, S can be from 11 to 27.\n\nBut let's see, what is the maximum value of a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2?\n\nSince each of a,b,c is at most 9, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 \u2264 81 + 81 +81=243.\n\nSimilarly, 9S -99, since S can be up to 27, 9*27 -99=243-99=144.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 can be up to 243, but in our case, 9S -99 can be up to 144. So, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 \u2264144.\n\nSo, for S from 11 to 27, 9S -99 must be equal to a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding all possible triples (a,b,c) where a, b, c are digits (0-9), a + b + c = S, and a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =9S -99.\n\nSo, the strategy is to find all possible S from 11 to 27 where 9S -99 can be expressed as the sum of squares of three digits a, b, c, and where a + b + c = S.\n\nSo, let's compute for each S from 11 to 27:\n\nFor each S, compute 9S -99, which is the target sum of squares, and check if there exist a, b, c (digits) such that a + b + c = S and a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =9S -99.",

The main point is that A + B + C = 8.\n\nSo, now the problem reduces to finding the number of possible digits A, B, C, D, E, F such that:\n\n- For each column i (1,2,3), digit i in top row plus digit i in bottom row equals 9. So, D=9\u2212A, E=9\u2212B, F=9\u2212C.\n\n- The sum of the top row digits A + B + C = 8.\n\nSo, the problem is now to find all possible triples (A,B,C) where each of A, B, C is a digit (0-9), their sum is 8, and then for each such triple, the digits D=9\u2212A, E=9\u2212B, F=9\u2212C must be digits (i.e., between 0 and 9).",

Then the equation becomes:\n\n10S + (27 - S) = 99.\n\nSimplify:\n\n10S + 27 - S = 99\n9S + 27 = 99\n9S = 72\nS = 8.\n\nSo, A + B + C = 8.\n\nSo, the sum of the top row digits A, B, C must be 8.\n\nAnd since D = 9 - A, E = 9 - B, F = 9 - C, the sum A + B + C = 8 implies that D + E + F = (9 - A) + (9 - B) + (9 - C) = 27 - (A + B + C) = 27 - 8 = 19.\n\nSo, D + E + F = 19.\n\nBut let's not get bogged down there. The main point is that A + B + C = 8.\n\nSo, now the problem reduces to finding the number of possible digits A, B, C, D, E, F such that:\n\n- For each column i (1,2,3), digit i in top row plus digit i in bottom row equals 9. So, D=9\u2212A, E=9\u2212B, F=9\u2212C.\n\n- The sum of the top row digits A + B + C = 8.\n\nSo, the problem is now to find all possible triples (A,B,C) where each of A, B, C is a digit (0-9), their sum is 8, and then for each such triple, the digits D=9\u2212A, E=9\u2212B, F=9\u2212C must be digits (i.e., between 0 and 9).",

So, from the first equation, each pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) must sum to 9. So, each pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) are digits that add up to 9.\n\nSo, A + D = 9\n\nB + E = 9\n\nC + F = 9\n\nThat's a big simplification. So, A and D are digits that sum to 9, same for B and E, and C and F.\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: AD + BE + CF = 99.\n\nEach of these is a two-digit number:\n\nAD = 10*A + D\n\nBE = 10*B + E\n\nCF = 10*C + F\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\n(10*A + D) + (10*B + E) + (10*C + F) = 99\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99\n\nHmm, interesting. Let me denote S1 = A + B + C and S2 = D + E + F. Then the equation becomes:\n\n10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nSo, 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nBut we also know from the first set of equations that A + D =9, B + E=9, C + F=9. So, if I add A + D + B + E + C + F = 27.\n\nWhich is, (A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 27\n\nSo, S1 + S2 = 27\n\nBut from the second equation, 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. S1 + S2 = 27\n\n2. 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n(10*S1 + S2) - (S1 + S2) = 99 - 27\n\nWhich gives:\n\n9*S1 = 72\n\nSo, S1 = 72 / 9 = 8\n\nThen, from the first equation, S2 = 27 - S1 = 27 -8=19\n\nSo, S1 = 8, S2=19\n\nSo, the sum of A + B + C =8, and the sum of D + E + F=19.\n\nSo, now, let me recap:\n\nWe have the following conditions:\n\n1. A + D = 9\n\n2. B + E = 9\n\n3. C + F = 9\n\n4. A + B + C =8\n\n5. D + E + F=19\n\nSo, from these, we can model the problem as:\n\nWe have variables A, B, C, D, E, F, each from 0 to9, such that:\n\nA + D =9\n\nB + E=9\n\nC + F=9\n\nA + B + C=8\n\nD + E + F=19\n\nSo, now I can approach this by first considering the possible values for (A, D), (B, E), (C, F) such that each pair sums to 9.\n\nEach pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) are pairs of digits that add up to 9. For each such pair, A can range from 0 to9, and D=9 -A, but since D must be a digit, A can be from 0 to9, but D=9-A must also be a digit, so A can be 0 to9.\n\nSimilarly for B and E, and C and F.\n\nSo, for each of the three pairs, there are 10 possible combinations (since A can be 0-9, D is 9-A, same for others). So, if there were no other constraints, each pair would have 10 possibilities, so total 10^3 =1000 possibilities. But we have the additional constraints that A + B + C=8 and D + E + F=19.\n\nHmm, so I need to count the number of triplets (A,B,C) and (D,E,F) such that:\n\nA + B + C=8\n\nD + E + F=19\n\nAnd also, D=9\u2212A, E=9\u2212B, F=9\u2212C",

So, from the first equation, each pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) must sum to 9. So, each pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) are digits that add up to 9.\n\nSo, A + D = 9\n\nB + E = 9\n\nC + F = 9\n\nThat's a big simplification. So, A and D are digits that sum to 9, same for B and E, and C and F.\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: AD + BE + CF = 99.\n\nEach of these is a two-digit number:\n\nAD = 10*A + D\n\nBE = 10*B + E\n\nCF = 10*C + F\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\n(10*A + D) + (10*B + E) + (10*C + F) = 99\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99\n\nHmm, interesting. Let me denote S1 = A + B + C and S2 = D + E + F. Then the equation becomes:\n\n10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nSo, 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nBut we also know from the first set of equations that A + D =9, B + E=9, C + F=9. So, if I add A + D + B + E + C + F = 27.\n\nWhich is, (A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 27\n\nSo, S1 + S2 = 27\n\nBut from the second equation, 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. S1 + S2 = 27\n\n2. 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n(10*S1 + S2) - (S1 + S2) = 99 - 27\n\nWhich gives:\n\n9*S1 = 72\n\nSo, S1 = 72 / 9 = 8\n\nThen, from the first equation, S2 = 27 - S1 = 27 -8=19\n\nSo, S1 = 8, S2=19\n\nSo, the sum of A + B + C =8, and the sum of D + E + F=19.\n\nSo, now, let me recap:\n\nWe have the following conditions:\n\n1. A + D = 9\n\n2. B + E = 9\n\n3. C + F = 9\n\n4. A + B + C =8\n\n5. D + E + F=19\n\nSo, from these, we can model the problem as:\n\nWe have variables A, B, C, D, E, F, each from 0 to9, such that:\n\nA + D =9\n\nB + E=9\n\nC + F=9\n\nA + B + C=8\n\nD + E + F=19\n\nSo, now I can approach this by first considering the possible values for (A, D), (B, E), (C, F) such that each pair sums to 9.\n\nEach pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) are pairs of digits that add up to 9. For each such pair, A can range from 0 to9, and D=9 -A, but since D must be a digit, A can be from 0 to9, but D=9-A must also be a digit, so A can be 0 to9.\n\nSimilarly for B and E, and C and F.\n\nSo, for each of the three pairs, there are 10 possible combinations (since A can be 0-9, D is 9-A, same for others). So, if there were no other constraints, each pair would have 10 possibilities, so total 10^3 =1000 possibilities. But we have the additional constraints that A + B + C=8 and D + E + F=19.\n\nHmm, so I need to count the number of triplets (A,B,C) and (D,E,F) such that:\n\nA + B + C=8\n\nD + E + F=19\n\nAnd also, D=9\u2212A, E=9\u2212B, F=9\u2212C",

So, c + f = 9 or 19, but since c and f are single digits, their sum can be at most 18 (9+9). So, c + f =9 or 19 is not possible because 19 would require each to be 10, which isn't allowed.

Well, since N1 and N2 are both three-digit numbers, their sum can't have a thousands digit. So, any carryover from the hundreds place must be zero. Since a and d are digits (0-9), their sum is 9, which is less than 10, so no carryover.\n\nSo, from the first equation, we get that:\n\nc + f=9  \nb + e=9  \na + d=9  \n\nSo, these are three equations.\n\nNow, moving on to the second condition: 10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) =99.\n\nLet me write S1 = a + b + c, S2 = d + e + f.\n\nSo, 10*S1 + S2 =99.\n\nBut from the first equations, we have:\n\na + d =9  \nb + e =9  \nc + f =9  \n\nWhich implies that:\n\nd=9 -a  \ne=9 -b  \nf=9 -c  \n\nSo, substituting into S2:\n\nS2 = d + e + f = (9 -a) + (9 -b) + (9 -c) = 27 - (a + b + c) =27 - S1.\n\nSo, substituting into the second equation:\n\n10*S1 + (27 - S1) =99  \nSimplify: 10S1 +27 - S1 =99  \nWhich is: 9S1 +27 =99  \nSubtract 27: 9S1=72  \nDivide by 9: S1=8\n\nSo, S1=8, which is a + b + c=8.\n\nAnd since S2=27 - S1=27 -8=19.\n\nSo, now we have:\n\na + b + c=8\n\nd=9 -a  \ne=9 -b  \nf=9 -c\n\nAlso, since d, e, f are digits, 0\u2264d,e,f\u22649.

So, d,e,f are all valid digits as long as a,b,c are digits.\n\nSo, our problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8, where a, b, c are digits (i.e., 0\u2264a,b,c\u22649).\n\nEach such solution will correspond to a unique grid, since d, e, f are determined by a, b, c.\n\nSo, the number of solutions is the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8, with a,b,c each between 0 and 9.\n\nBut since 8 is less than 10, and each variable can take 0-9, all solutions will satisfy 0\u2264a,b,c\u22649, so we don't have to worry about the upper limits.\n\nThe number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8 is C(8 + 3 -1, 3 -1) = C(10,2)=45.",
          "text2": "Wait, is that correct? Let me check:\n\nIf A + D = 9, then 100*(A + D) = 900\n\nIf B + E = 9, then 10*(B + E) = 90\n\nIf C + F = 9, then (C + F) = 9\n\nAdding them together: 900 + 90 + 9 = 999, which is correct.\n\nSo, that's a key insight. So, from the first equation, each pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) must sum to 9. So, each pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) are digits that add up to 9.\n\nSo, A + D = 9\n\nB + E = 9\n\nC + F = 9\n\nThat's a big simplification. So, A and D are digits that sum to 9, same for B and E, and C and F.\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: AD + BE + CF = 99.\n\nEach of these is a two-digit number:\n\nAD = 10*A + D\n\nBE = 10*B + E\n\nCF = 10*C + F\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\n(10*A + D) + (10*B + E) + (10*C + F) = 99\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99\n\nHmm, interesting. Let me denote S1 = A + B + C and S2 = D + E + F. Then the equation becomes:\n\n10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nSo, 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nBut we also know from the first set of equations that A + D =9, B + E=9, C + F=9. So, if I add A + D + B + E + C + F = 27.\n\nWhich is, (A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 27\n\nSo, S1 + S2 = 27\n\nBut from the second equation, 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. S1 + S2 = 27\n\n2. 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n(10*S1 + S2) - (S1 + S2) = 99 - 27\n\nWhich gives:\n\n9*S1 = 72\n\nSo, S1 = 72 / 9 = 8\n\nThen, from the first equation, S2 = 27 - S1 = 27 -8=19\n\nSo, S1 = 8, S2=19\n\nSo, the sum of A + B + C =8, and the sum of D + E + F=19.\n\nSo, now, let me recap:\n\nWe have the following conditions:\n\n1. A + D = 9\n\n2. B + E = 9\n\n3. C + F = 9\n\n4. A + B + C =8\n\n5. D + E + F=19\n\nSo, from these, we can model the problem as:\n\nWe have variables A, B, C, D, E, F, each from 0 to9, such that:\n\nA + D =9\n\nB + E=9\n\nC + F=9\n\nA + B + C=8\n\nD + E + F=19\n\nSo, now I can approach this by first considering the possible values for (A, D), (B, E), (C, F) such that each pair sums to 9.\n\nEach pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) are pairs of digits that add up to 9. For each such pair, A can range from 0 to9, and D=9 -A, but since D must be a digit, A can be from 0 to9, but D=9-A must also be a digit, so A can be 0 to9.\n\nSimilarly for B and E, and C and F.\n\nSo, for each of the three pairs, there are 10 possible combinations (since A can be 0-9, D is 9-A, same for others). So, if there were no other constraints, each pair would have 10 possibilities, so total 10^3 =1000 possibilities. But we have the additional constraints that A + B + C=8 and D + E + F=19.\n\nHmm, so I need to count the number of triplets (A,B,C) and (D,E,F) such that:\n\nA + B + C=8\n\nD + E + F=19\n\nAnd also, D=9\u2212A, E=9\u2212B, F=9\u2212C",

So, when you think about the maximum possible value of 100 S1 + 10 S2 + S3, since S1 can be up to 18, S2 up to 18, S3 up to 18. So 100*18=1800, 10*18=180, 18 => total up to 1998.

So S1 must be 9, because 100*9=900, and then 10 S2 + S3 must be 99.\n\nSo, S1=9.\n\nThen, 10 S2 + S3 = 99.\n\nSimilarly, since 10 S2 + S3 = 99.\n\nBut S2 and S3 are sums of two digits each, so S2 can be between 0 and 18, and likewise S3.\n\nWe need to find S2 and S3 such that 10 S2 + S3 = 99. Let's think about possible S2 and S3.\n\nSo, 10 S2 + S3 = 99.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as S3 = 99 - 10 S2.\n\nSince S3 must be between 0 and 18, let's see for which S2 this is possible.\n\nS3 = 99 -10 S2 >= 0 --> 99 >=10 S2 --> S2 <=9.9, so S2 <=9.\n\nAlso, S3 = 99-10 S2 <=18.\n\nSo, 99-10 S2 <=18 --> 99-18 <=10 S2 --> 81 <=10 S2 --> S2 >=8.1, so since S2 is integer, S2 >=9.\n\nSo, S2 can be 9 only, because 8.1 <= S2 <=9.9, but S2 must be integer. So S2=9.\n\nThen, S3=99 -10*9=99-90=9.\n\nSo, S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.\n\nSo, from equation A, we have S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.\n\nNow, equation B: 10 S4 + S5 = 99.\n\nWe need to find S4 and S5 such that 10 S4 + S5=99.\n\nSimilarly, S4 is a + b + c, which is the sum of the top row. Each a, b, c is a digit (0-9), so S4 can be between 0 and 27.\n\nSimilarly, S5 is d + e + f, the sum of the bottom row, so S5 is between 0 and 27.\n\nSo, 10 S4 + S5 =99.\n\nWe can think of this as a two-digit number S4 S5 =99. So S4 is the tens digit and S5 is the units digit.\n\nSo, S4 must be 9, and S5 must be 9, because 99 is 9*10 +9.\n\nSo, S4=9 and S5=9.\n\nSo, now we have:\n\nFrom equation A:\n\nS1 = a + d =9,\n\nS2 = b + e=9,\n\nS3 = c + f=9.\n\nFrom equation B:\n\nS4 = a + b + c=9,\n\nS5 = d + e + f=9.\n\nSo now, we have the following system:\n\n1) a + d =9.\n\n2) b + e=9.\n\n3) c + f=9.\n\n4) a + b + c=9.\n\n5) d + e + f=9.\n\nNow, I need to find all possible digits a,b,c,d,e,f (each 0-9) satisfying these equations.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nWe have variables a, b, c, d, e, f.\n\nFrom equations 1,2,3: a + d=9, b + e=9, c + f=9.\n\nFrom equation 4: a + b + c=9.\n\nFrom equation 5: d + e + f=9.\n\nSo, let's think about equation 4: a + b + c=9.\n\nBut since a, b, c are digits, each can be 0-9, and their sum is 9.\n\nSimilarly, equation 5: d + e + f=9, same thing.\n\nBut from equations 1,2,3, we have:\n\nd =9 -a,\n\ne =9 -b,\n\nf=9 -c.\n\nSo, substituting into equation 5:\n\nd + e + f = (9 -a) + (9 - b) + (9 - c) = 27 - (a + b + c).\n\nBut equation 5 says that this equals 9.\n\nSo, 27 - (a + b + c) =9.\n\nWhich implies that a + b + c=18.",

Let me think differently.\n\nSince S1=9, equation 1 simplifies to 10 S2 + S3=99.\n\nNow, equation 2 is 10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f)=99.\n\nBut (a + b + c) is the sum of the first row, and (d + e + f) is the sum of the second row. Let me denote R1 = a + b + c and R2 = d + e + f.\n\nSo equation 2 becomes 10 R1 + R2 =99.\n\nBut R1 + R2 is the total sum of all digits in the grid, which is (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = S1 + S2 + S3.\n\nSo R1 + R2 = S1 + S2 + S3.\n\nBut from equation 1, S1=9, and 10 S2 + S3=99.\n\nSo S3=99 -10 S2.\n\nSo R1 + R2 = 9 + S2 + (99 -10 S2) = 9 + 99 -9 S2 = 108 -9 S2.\n\nBut from equation 2, 10 R1 + R2=99.\n\nSo now, I have two equations:\n\n1) R1 + R2 = 108 -9 S2\n\n2) 10 R1 + R2 =99\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(10 R1 + R2) - (R1 + R2) )= 99 - (108 -9 S2)\n\n9 R1 = 99 - 108 +9 S2\n\n9 R1 = -9 +9 S2\n\nDivide both sides by 9:\n\nR1 = -1 + S2\n\nSo R1 = S2 -1.\n\nBut R1 is the sum of a, b, c, which are digits. So R1 can be from 0 to 27 (since each of a, b, c can be 0-9, sum up to 27). Similarly, S2 = b + e, where b and e are digits, so S2 ranges from 0 to 18.\n\nSince R1 = S2 -1, and R1 >=0, then S2 must be at least 1, because R1 can't be negative. So S2 >=1.\n\nSo now, R1 = S2 -1.\n\nNow, from equation 1: 10 S2 + S3 =99.\n\nBut S3 = c + f.\n\nSo S3 =99 -10 S2.\n\nBut since S3 is the sum of two digits, c and f, which are each between 0 and9, S3 must be between 0 and 18. So 0 <= S3 <=18.\n\nSo 99 -10 S2 must be between 0 and 18.\n\nSo 0 <=99 -10 S2 <=18\n\nLet me solve for S2:\n\nFirst, lower bound:\n\n99 -10 S2 >=0\n\n10 S2 <=99\n\nS2 <=9.9. Since S2 is integer, S2 <=9.\n\nUpper bound:\n\n99 -10 S2 <=18\n\n99 -18 <=10 S2\n\n81 <=10 S2\n\nS2 >=8.1. So since S2 is integer, S2 >=9.\n\nSo combining both, S2 must be exactly 9.\n\nSo S2=9.\n\nThen, S3=99 -10*9=99-90=9.\n\nSo now we have S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.\n\nSo now, let's recap:\n\nS1= a + d=9\n\nS2= b + e=9\n\nS3= c + f=9\n\nAdditionally, from equation 2, R1 = S2 -1 =9-1=8.\n\nR1 is the sum of a + b + c=8.\n\nSimilarly, R2= d + e + f.\n\nFrom equation 2, 10 R1 + R2=99.\n\nSince R1=8, 10*8 + R2=99 \u2192 80 + R2=99 \u2192 R2=19.\n\nSo R2= d + e + f=19.\n\nNow, let's see what we have:\n\n1) a + d=9 \u2192 d=9 - a\n\n2) b + e=9 \u2192 e=9 - b\n\n3) c + f=9 \u2192 f=9 - c\n\n4) a + b + c=8\n\n5) d + e + f=19\n\nBut substituting d, e, f from 1,2,3 into equation5:\n\nd + e + f = (9 -a) + (9 -b) + (9 -c) = 27 - (a + b + c) =27 - R1=27 -8=19, which matches equation5. So that's consistent.\n\nSo now, all variables are expressed in terms of a, b, c.\n\nSo our problem now reduces to finding all possible values of a, b, c, d, e, f with the following constraints:\n\na: 0-9\n\nb:0-9\n\nc:0-9\n\nd=9 -a\n\ne=9 -b\n\nf=9 -c\n\nAdditionally,\n\na + b + c=8.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =8, where each of a, b, c is between 0 and 9, inclusive.\n\nBut since 8 is less than 3*9=27, and each variable can be at most 9, but 8 is much smaller, so all solutions where a, b, c are non-negative integers adding to 8, and each is <=9.\n\nWhich is the same as the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8, where 0 <= a, b, c <=9.\n\nThe number of solutions is C(8 +3 -1, 3 -1)=C(10,2)=45. But since 8 is less than 9, there's no need to subtract any cases where variables exceed 9.\n\nSo there are 45 possible solutions for (a, b, c). For each such solution, d=9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c.\n\nBut we also have to make sure that d, e, f are digits, i.e., between 0 and9.\n\nSince a, b, c are non-negative and <=9, d=9 -a is between 0 and9, same for e and f.\n\nSo each solution for a, b, c gives a valid d, e, f.\n\nThus, the number of possible grids is 45.",

So, from the first equation, each pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) must sum to 9. So, each pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) are digits that add up to 9.\n\nSo, A + D = 9\n\nB + E = 9\n\nC + F = 9\n\nThat's a big simplification. So, A and D are digits that sum to 9, same for B and E, and C and F.\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: AD + BE + CF = 99.\n\nEach of these is a two-digit number:\n\nAD = 10*A + D\n\nBE = 10*B + E\n\nCF = 10*C + F\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\n(10*A + D) + (10*B + E) + (10*C + F) = 99\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99\n\nHmm, interesting. Let me denote S1 = A + B + C and S2 = D + E + F. Then the equation becomes:\n\n10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nSo, 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nBut we also know from the first set of equations that A + D =9, B + E=9, C + F=9. So, if I add A + D + B + E + C + F = 27.\n\nWhich is, (A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 27\n\nSo, S1 + S2 = 27\n\nBut from the second equation, 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. S1 + S2 = 27\n\n2. 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n(10*S1 + S2) - (S1 + S2) = 99 - 27\n\nWhich gives:\n\n9*S1 = 72\n\nSo, S1 = 72 / 9 = 8\n\nThen, from the first equation, S2 = 27 - S1 = 27 -8=19\n\nSo, S1 = 8, S2=19\n\nSo, the sum of A + B + C =8, and the sum of D + E + F=19.\n\nSo, now, let me recap:\n\nWe have the following conditions:\n\n1. A + D = 9\n\n2. B + E = 9\n\n3. C + F = 9\n\n4. A + B + C =8\n\n5. D + E + F=19\n\nSo, from these, we can model the problem as:\n\nWe have variables A, B, C, D, E, F, each from 0 to9, such that:\n\nA + D =9\n\nB + E=9\n\nC + F=9\n\nA + B + C=8\n\nD + E + F=19\n\nSo, now I can approach this by first considering the possible values for (A, D), (B, E), (C, F) such that each pair sums to 9.\n\nEach pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) are pairs of digits that add up to 9. For each such pair, A can range from 0 to9, and D=9 -A, but since D must be a digit, A can be from 0 to9, but D=9-A must also be a digit, so A can be 0 to9.\n\nSimilarly for B and E, and C and F.\n\nSo, for each of the three pairs, there are 10 possible combinations (since A can be 0-9, D is 9-A, same for others). So, if there were no other constraints, each pair would have 10 possibilities, so total 10^3 =1000 possibilities. But we have the additional constraints that A + B + C=8 and D + E + F=19.\n\nHmm, so I need to count the number of triplets (A,B,C) and (D,E,F) such that:\n\nA + B + C=8\n\nD + E + F=19\n\nAnd also, D=9\u2212A, E=9\u2212B, F=9\u2212C",

So, from the first equation, each pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) must sum to 9. So, each pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) are digits that add up to 9.\n\nSo, A + D = 9\n\nB + E = 9\n\nC + F = 9\n\nThat's a big simplification. So, A and D are digits that sum to 9, same for B and E, and C and F.\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: AD + BE + CF = 99.\n\nEach of these is a two-digit number:\n\nAD = 10*A + D\n\nBE = 10*B + E\n\nCF = 10*C + F\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\n(10*A + D) + (10*B + E) + (10*C + F) = 99\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99\n\nHmm, interesting. Let me denote S1 = A + B + C and S2 = D + E + F. Then the equation becomes:\n\n10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nSo, 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nBut we also know from the first set of equations that A + D =9, B + E=9, C + F=9. So, if I add A + D + B + E + C + F = 27.\n\nWhich is, (A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 27\n\nSo, S1 + S2 = 27\n\nBut from the second equation, 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. S1 + S2 = 27\n\n2. 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n(10*S1 + S2) - (S1 + S2) = 99 - 27\n\nWhich gives:\n\n9*S1 = 72\n\nSo, S1 = 72 / 9 = 8\n\nThen, from the first equation, S2 = 27 - S1 = 27 -8=19\n\nSo, S1 = 8, S2=19\n\nSo, the sum of A + B + C =8, and the sum of D + E + F=19.\n\nSo, now, let me recap:\n\nWe have the following conditions:\n\n1. A + D = 9\n\n2. B + E = 9\n\n3. C + F = 9\n\n4. A + B + C =8\n\n5. D + E + F=19\n\nSo, from these, we can model the problem as:\n\nWe have variables A, B, C, D, E, F, each from 0 to9, such that:\n\nA + D =9\n\nB + E=9\n\nC + F=9\n\nA + B + C=8\n\nD + E + F=19\n\nSo, now I can approach this by first considering the possible values for (A, D), (B, E), (C, F) such that each pair sums to 9.\n\nEach pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) are pairs of digits that add up to 9. For each such pair, A can range from 0 to9, and D=9 -A, but since D must be a digit, A can be from 0 to9, but D=9-A must also be a digit, so A can be 0 to9.\n\nSimilarly for B and E, and C and F.\n\nSo, for each of the three pairs, there are 10 possible combinations (since A can be 0-9, D is 9-A, same for others). So, if there were no other constraints, each pair would have 10 possibilities, so total 10^3 =1000 possibilities. But we have the additional constraints that A + B + C=8 and D + E + F=19.\n\nHmm, so I need to count the number of triplets (A,B,C) and (D,E,F) such that:\n\nA + B + C=8\n\nD + E + F=19\n\nAnd also, D=9\u2212A, E=9\u2212B, F=9\u2212C",

But in this case, N1 + N2 is 999, so:\n\nLet me think in terms of digits:\n\n- The units place: c + f must end with 9. So, c + f = 9 or 19, but since c and f are single digits, their sum can be at most 18 (9+9). So, c + f =9 or 19 is not possible because 19 would require each to be 10, which isn't allowed. So, c + f =9.\n\nSimilarly, the tens place: b + e + carryover from units place must equal 9. Since carryover from units is 0 (because c+f=9), so b + e =9.\n\nThe hundreds place: a + d + carryover from tens place must equal 9. Again, carryover from tens is 0 (since b + e=9), so a + d=9.\n\nSo, that gives us:\n\n1. c + f =9  \n2. b + e =9  \n3. a + d =9  \n\nAnd the thousands place? Well, since N1 and N2 are both three-digit numbers, their sum can't have a thousands digit. So, any carryover from the hundreds place must be zero. Since a and d are digits (0-9), their sum is 9, which is less than 10, so no carryover.\n\nSo, from the first equation, we get that:\n\nc + f=9  \nb + e=9  \na + d=9  \n\nSo, these are three equations.\n\nNow, moving on to the second condition: 10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) =99.\n\nLet me write S1 = a + b + c, S2 = d + e + f.\n\nSo, 10*S1 + S2 =99.\n\nBut from the first equations, we have:\n\na + d =9  \nb + e =9  \nc + f =9  \n\nWhich implies that:\n\nd=9 -a  \ne=9 -b  \nf=9 -c  \n\nSo, substituting into S2:\n\nS2 = d + e + f = (9 -a) + (9 -b) + (9 -c) = 27 - (a + b + c) =27 - S1.\n\nSo, substituting into the second equation:\n\n10*S1 + (27 - S1) =99  \nSimplify: 10S1 +27 - S1 =99  \nWhich is: 9S1 +27 =99  \nSubtract 27: 9S1=72  \nDivide by 9: S1=8\n\nSo, S1=8, which is a + b + c=8.\n\nAnd since S2=27 - S1=27 -8=19.\n\nSo, now we have:\n\na + b + c=8\n\nd=9 -a  \ne=9 -b  \nf=9 -c\n\nAlso, since d, e, f are digits, 0\u2264d,e,f\u22649. Because a, b, c are digits, 0\u2264a,b,c\u22649, so d=9-a will be \u22650 when a\u22649, which it is. So, d,e,f are all valid digits as long as a,b,c are digits.\n\nSo, our problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8, where a, b, c are digits (i.e., 0\u2264a,b,c\u22649).\n\nEach such solution will correspond to a unique grid, since d, e, f are determined by a, b, c.\n\nSo, the number of solutions is the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8, with a,b,c each between 0 and 9.\n\nBut since 8 is less than 10, and each variable can take 0-9, all solutions will satisfy 0\u2264a,b,c\u22649, so we don't have to worry about the upper limits.\n\nThe number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8 is C(8 + 3 -1, 3 -1) = C(10,2)=45.",

So, from the first equation, each pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) must sum to 9.

So, A and D are digits that sum to 9, same for B and E, and C and F.\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: AD + BE + CF = 99.\n\nEach of these is a two-digit number:\n\nAD = 10*A + D\n\nBE = 10*B + E\n\nCF = 10*C + F\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\n(10*A + D) + (10*B + E) + (10*C + F) = 99\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99\n\nHmm, interesting. Let me denote S1 = A + B + C and S2 = D + E + F. Then the equation becomes:\n\n10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nSo, 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nBut we also know from the first set of equations that A + D =9, B + E=9, C + F=9. So, if I add A + D + B + E + C + F = 27.\n\nWhich is, (A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 27\n\nSo, S1 + S2 = 27\n\nBut from the second equation, 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. S1 + S2 = 27\n\n2. 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n(10*S1 + S2) - (S1 + S2) = 99 - 27\n\nWhich gives:\n\n9*S1 = 72\n\nSo, S1 = 72 / 9 = 8\n\nThen, from the first equation, S2 = 27 - S1 = 27 -8=19\n\nSo, S1 = 8, S2=19\n\nSo, the sum of A + B + C =8, and the sum of D + E + F=19.\n\nSo, now, let me recap:\n\nWe have the following conditions:\n\n1. A + D = 9\n\n2. B + E = 9\n\n3. C + F = 9\n\n4. A + B + C =8\n\n5. D + E + F=19\n\nSo, from these, we can model the problem as:\n\nWe have variables A, B, C, D, E, F, each from 0 to9, such that:\n\nA + D =9\n\nB + E=9\n\nC + F=9\n\nA + B + C=8\n\nD + E + F=19\n\nSo, now I can approach this by first considering the possible values for (A, D), (B, E), (C, F) such that each pair sums to 9.\n\nEach pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) are pairs of digits that add up to 9. For each such pair, A can range from 0 to9, and D=9 -A, but since D must be a digit, A can be from 0 to9, but D=9-A must also be a digit, so A can be 0 to9.\n\nSimilarly for B and E, and C and F.\n\nSo, for each of the three pairs, there are 10 possible combinations (since A can be 0-9, D is 9-A, same for others). So, if there were no other constraints, each pair would have 10 possibilities, so total 10^3 =1000 possibilities. But we have the additional constraints that A + B + C=8 and D + E + F=19.\n\nHmm, so I need to count the number of triplets (A,B,C) and (D,E,F) such that:\n\nA + B + C=8\n\nD + E + F=19\n\nAnd also, D=9\u2212A, E=9\u2212B, F=9\u2212C",

So that's consistent.\n\nSo now, all variables are expressed in terms of a, b, c.\n\nSo our problem now reduces to finding all possible values of a, b, c, d, e, f with the following constraints:\n\na: 0-9\n\nb:0-9\n\nc:0-9\n\nd=9 -a\n\ne=9 -b\n\nf=9 -c\n\nAdditionally,\n\na + b + c=8.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =8, where each of a, b, c is between 0 and 9, inclusive.\n\nBut since 8 is less than 3*9=27, and each variable can be at most 9, but 8 is much smaller, so all solutions where a, b, c are non-negative integers adding to 8, and each is <=9.\n\nWhich is the same as the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8, where 0 <= a, b, c <=9.\n\nThe number of solutions is C(8 +3 -1, 3 -1)=C(10,2)=45. But since 8 is less than 9, there's no need to subtract any cases where variables exceed 9.\n\nSo there are 45 possible solutions for (a, b, c). For each such solution, d=9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c.\n\nBut we also have to make sure that d, e, f are digits, i.e., between 0 and9.\n\nSince a, b, c are non-negative and <=9, d=9 -a is between 0 and9, same for e and f.\n\nSo each solution for a, b, c gives a valid d, e, f.\n\nThus, the number of possible grids is 45.",

Let me check:\n\nIf A + D = 9, then 100*(A + D) = 900\n\nIf B + E = 9, then 10*(B + E) = 90\n\nIf C + F = 9, then (C + F) = 9\n\nAdding them together: 900 + 90 + 9 = 999, which is correct.\n\nSo, that's a key insight. So, from the first equation, each pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) must sum to 9. So, each pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) are digits that add up to 9.\n\nSo, A + D = 9\n\nB + E = 9\n\nC + F = 9\n\nThat's a big simplification. So, A and D are digits that sum to 9, same for B and E, and C and F.\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: AD + BE + CF = 99.\n\nEach of these is a two-digit number:\n\nAD = 10*A + D\n\nBE = 10*B + E\n\nCF = 10*C + F\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\n(10*A + D) + (10*B + E) + (10*C + F) = 99\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99\n\nHmm, interesting. Let me denote S1 = A + B + C and S2 = D + E + F. Then the equation becomes:\n\n10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nSo, 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nBut we also know from the first set of equations that A + D =9, B + E=9, C + F=9. So, if I add A + D + B + E + C + F = 27.\n\nWhich is, (A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 27\n\nSo, S1 + S2 = 27\n\nBut from the second equation, 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. S1 + S2 = 27\n\n2. 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n(10*S1 + S2) - (S1 + S2) = 99 - 27\n\nWhich gives:\n\n9*S1 = 72\n\nSo, S1 = 72 / 9 = 8\n\nThen, from the first equation, S2 = 27 - S1 = 27 -8=19\n\nSo, S1 = 8, S2=19\n\nSo, the sum of A + B + C =8, and the sum of D + E + F=19.\n\nSo, now, let me recap:\n\nWe have the following conditions:\n\n1. A + D = 9\n\n2. B + E = 9\n\n3. C + F = 9\n\n4. A + B + C =8\n\n5. D + E + F=19\n\nSo, from these, we can model the problem as:\n\nWe have variables A, B, C, D, E, F, each from 0 to9, such that:\n\nA + D =9\n\nB + E=9\n\nC + F=9\n\nA + B + C=8\n\nD + E + F=19\n\nSo, now I can approach this by first considering the possible values for (A, D), (B, E), (C, F) such that each pair sums to 9.\n\nEach pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) are pairs of digits that add up to 9. For each such pair, A can range from 0 to9, and D=9 -A, but since D must be a digit, A can be from 0 to9, but D=9-A must also be a digit, so A can be 0 to9.\n\nSimilarly for B and E, and C and F.\n\nSo, for each of the three pairs, there are 10 possible combinations (since A can be 0-9, D is 9-A, same for others). So, if there were no other constraints, each pair would have 10 possibilities, so total 10^3 =1000 possibilities. But we have the additional constraints that A + B + C=8 and D + E + F=19.\n\nHmm, so I need to count the number of triplets (A,B,C) and (D,E,F) such that:\n\nA + B + C=8\n\nD + E + F=19\n\nAnd also, D=9\u2212A, E=9\u2212B, F=9\u2212C",

So, from the first equation, each pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) must sum to 9. So, each pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) are digits that add up to 9.\n\nSo, A + D = 9\n\nB + E = 9\n\nC + F = 9\n\nThat's a big simplification. So, A and D are digits that sum to 9, same for B and E, and C and F.\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: AD + BE + CF = 99.\n\nEach of these is a two-digit number:\n\nAD = 10*A + D\n\nBE = 10*B + E\n\nCF = 10*C + F\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\n(10*A + D) + (10*B + E) + (10*C + F) = 99\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99\n\nHmm, interesting. Let me denote S1 = A + B + C and S2 = D + E + F. Then the equation becomes:\n\n10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nSo, 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nBut we also know from the first set of equations that A + D =9, B + E=9, C + F=9. So, if I add A + D + B + E + C + F = 27.\n\nWhich is, (A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 27\n\nSo, S1 + S2 = 27\n\nBut from the second equation, 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. S1 + S2 = 27\n\n2. 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n(10*S1 + S2) - (S1 + S2) = 99 - 27\n\nWhich gives:\n\n9*S1 = 72\n\nSo, S1 = 72 / 9 = 8\n\nThen, from the first equation, S2 = 27 - S1 = 27 -8=19\n\nSo, S1 = 8, S2=19\n\nSo, the sum of A + B + C =8, and the sum of D + E + F=19.\n\nSo, now, let me recap:\n\nWe have the following conditions:\n\n1. A + D = 9\n\n2. B + E = 9\n\n3. C + F = 9\n\n4. A + B + C =8\n\n5. D + E + F=19\n\nSo, from these, we can model the problem as:\n\nWe have variables A, B, C, D, E, F, each from 0 to9, such that:\n\nA + D =9\n\nB + E=9\n\nC + F=9\n\nA + B + C=8\n\nD + E + F=19\n\nSo, now I can approach this by first considering the possible values for (A, D), (B, E), (C, F) such that each pair sums to 9.\n\nEach pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) are pairs of digits that add up to 9. For each such pair, A can range from 0 to9, and D=9 -A, but since D must be a digit, A can be from 0 to9, but D=9-A must also be a digit, so A can be 0 to9.\n\nSimilarly for B and E, and C and F.\n\nSo, for each of the three pairs, there are 10 possible combinations (since A can be 0-9, D is 9-A, same for others). So, if there were no other constraints, each pair would have 10 possibilities, so total 10^3 =1000 possibilities. But we have the additional constraints that A + B + C=8 and D + E + F=19.\n\nHmm, so I need to count the number of triplets (A,B,C) and (D,E,F) such that:\n\nA + B + C=8\n\nD + E + F=19\n\nAnd also, D=9\u2212A, E=9\u2212B, F=9\u2212C",

S1 + S2 = 27\n\n2. 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n(10*S1 + S2) - (S1 + S2) = 99 - 27\n\nWhich gives:\n\n9*S1 = 72\n\nSo, S1 = 72 / 9 = 8\n\nThen, from the first equation, S2 = 27 - S1 = 27 -8=19\n\nSo, S1 = 8, S2=19\n\nSo, the sum of A + B + C =8, and the sum of D + E + F=19.\n\nSo, now, let me recap:\n\nWe have the following conditions:\n\n1. A + D = 9\n\n2. B + E = 9\n\n3. C + F = 9\n\n4. A + B + C =8\n\n5. D + E + F=19\n\nSo, from these, we can model the problem as:\n\nWe have variables A, B, C, D, E, F, each from 0 to9, such that:\n\nA + D =9\n\nB + E=9\n\nC + F=9\n\nA + B + C=8\n\nD + E + F=19\n\nSo, now I can approach this by first considering the possible values for (A, D), (B, E), (C, F) such that each pair sums to 9.\n\nEach pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) are pairs of digits that add up to 9. For each such pair, A can range from 0 to9, and D=9 -A, but since D must be a digit, A can be from 0 to9, but D=9-A must also be a digit, so A can be 0 to9.\n\nSimilarly for B and E, and C and F.\n\nSo, for each of the three pairs, there are 10 possible combinations (since A can be 0-9, D is 9-A, same for others). So, if there were no other constraints, each pair would have 10 possibilities, so total 10^3 =1000 possibilities.

But in this case, N1 + N2 is 999, so:\n\nLet me think in terms of digits:\n\n- The units place: c + f must end with 9. So, c + f = 9 or 19, but since c and f are single digits, their sum can be at most 18 (9+9). So, c + f =9 or 19 is not possible because 19 would require each to be 10, which isn't allowed. So, c + f =9.\n\nSimilarly, the tens place: b + e + carryover from units place must equal 9. Since carryover from units is 0 (because c+f=9), so b + e =9.\n\nThe hundreds place: a + d + carryover from tens place must equal 9. Again, carryover from tens is 0 (since b + e=9), so a + d=9.\n\nSo, that gives us:\n\n1. c + f =9  \n2. b + e =9  \n3. a + d =9  \n\nAnd the thousands place? Well, since N1 and N2 are both three-digit numbers, their sum can't have a thousands digit. So, any carryover from the hundreds place must be zero. Since a and d are digits (0-9), their sum is 9, which is less than 10, so no carryover.\n\nSo, from the first equation, we get that:\n\nc + f=9  \nb + e=9  \na + d=9  \n\nSo, these are three equations.\n\nNow, moving on to the second condition: 10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) =99.\n\nLet me write S1 = a + b + c, S2 = d + e + f.\n\nSo, 10*S1 + S2 =99.\n\nBut from the first equations, we have:\n\na + d =9  \nb + e =9  \nc + f =9  \n\nWhich implies that:\n\nd=9 -a  \ne=9 -b  \nf=9 -c  \n\nSo, substituting into S2:\n\nS2 = d + e + f = (9 -a) + (9 -b) + (9 -c) = 27 - (a + b + c) =27 - S1.\n\nSo, substituting into the second equation:\n\n10*S1 + (27 - S1) =99  \nSimplify: 10S1 +27 - S1 =99  \nWhich is: 9S1 +27 =99  \nSubtract 27: 9S1=72  \nDivide by 9: S1=8\n\nSo, S1=8, which is a + b + c=8.\n\nAnd since S2=27 - S1=27 -8=19.\n\nSo, now we have:\n\na + b + c=8\n\nd=9 -a  \ne=9 -b  \nf=9 -c\n\nAlso, since d, e, f are digits, 0\u2264d,e,f\u22649. Because a, b, c are digits, 0\u2264a,b,c\u22649, so d=9-a will be \u22650 when a\u22649, which it is. So, d,e,f are all valid digits as long as a,b,c are digits.\n\nSo, our problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8, where a, b, c are digits (i.e., 0\u2264a,b,c\u22649).\n\nEach such solution will correspond to a unique grid, since d, e, f are determined by a, b, c.\n\nSo, the number of solutions is the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8, with a,b,c each between 0 and 9.\n\nBut since 8 is less than 10, and each variable can take 0-9, all solutions will satisfy 0\u2264a,b,c\u22649, so we don't have to worry about the upper limits.\n\nThe number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8 is C(8 + 3 -1, 3 -1) = C(10,2)=45.",

So, from the first equation, each pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) must sum to 9.

So, A and D are digits that sum to 9, same for B and E, and C and F.\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: AD + BE + CF = 99.\n\nEach of these is a two-digit number:\n\nAD = 10*A + D\n\nBE = 10*B + E\n\nCF = 10*C + F\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\n(10*A + D) + (10*B + E) + (10*C + F) = 99\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99\n\nHmm, interesting. Let me denote S1 = A + B + C and S2 = D + E + F. Then the equation becomes:\n\n10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nSo, 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nBut we also know from the first set of equations that A + D =9, B + E=9, C + F=9. So, if I add A + D + B + E + C + F = 27.\n\nWhich is, (A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 27\n\nSo, S1 + S2 = 27\n\nBut from the second equation, 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. S1 + S2 = 27\n\n2. 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n(10*S1 + S2) - (S1 + S2) = 99 - 27\n\nWhich gives:\n\n9*S1 = 72\n\nSo, S1 = 72 / 9 = 8\n\nThen, from the first equation, S2 = 27 - S1 = 27 -8=19\n\nSo, S1 = 8, S2=19\n\nSo, the sum of A + B + C =8, and the sum of D + E + F=19.\n\nSo, now, let me recap:\n\nWe have the following conditions:\n\n1. A + D = 9\n\n2. B + E = 9\n\n3. C + F = 9\n\n4. A + B + C =8\n\n5. D + E + F=19\n\nSo, from these, we can model the problem as:\n\nWe have variables A, B, C, D, E, F, each from 0 to9, such that:\n\nA + D =9\n\nB + E=9\n\nC + F=9\n\nA + B + C=8\n\nD + E + F=19\n\nSo, now I can approach this by first considering the possible values for (A, D), (B, E), (C, F) such that each pair sums to 9.\n\nEach pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) are pairs of digits that add up to 9. For each such pair, A can range from 0 to9, and D=9 -A, but since D must be a digit, A can be from 0 to9, but D=9-A must also be a digit, so A can be 0 to9.\n\nSimilarly for B and E, and C and F.\n\nSo, for each of the three pairs, there are 10 possible combinations (since A can be 0-9, D is 9-A, same for others). So, if there were no other constraints, each pair would have 10 possibilities, so total 10^3 =1000 possibilities. But we have the additional constraints that A + B + C=8 and D + E + F=19.\n\nHmm, so I need to count the number of triplets (A,B,C) and (D,E,F) such that:\n\nA + B + C=8\n\nD + E + F=19\n\nAnd also, D=9\u2212A, E=9\u2212B, F=9\u2212C",

Let me think differently.\n\nSince S1=9, equation 1 simplifies to 10 S2 + S3=99.\n\nNow, equation 2 is 10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f)=99.\n\nBut (a + b + c) is the sum of the first row, and (d + e + f) is the sum of the second row.

So R1 can be from 0 to 27 (since each of a, b, c can be 0-9, sum up to 27). Similarly, S2 = b + e, where b and e are digits, so S2 ranges from 0 to 18.\n\nSince R1 = S2 -1, and R1 >=0, then S2 must be at least 1, because R1 can't be negative. So S2 >=1.\n\nSo now, R1 = S2 -1.\n\nNow, from equation 1: 10 S2 + S3 =99.\n\nBut S3 = c + f.\n\nSo S3 =99 -10 S2.\n\nBut since S3 is the sum of two digits, c and f, which are each between 0 and9, S3 must be between 0 and 18. So 0 <= S3 <=18.\n\nSo 99 -10 S2 must be between 0 and 18.\n\nSo 0 <=99 -10 S2 <=18\n\nLet me solve for S2:\n\nFirst, lower bound:\n\n99 -10 S2 >=0\n\n10 S2 <=99\n\nS2 <=9.9. Since S2 is integer, S2 <=9.\n\nUpper bound:\n\n99 -10 S2 <=18\n\n99 -18 <=10 S2\n\n81 <=10 S2\n\nS2 >=8.1. So since S2 is integer, S2 >=9.\n\nSo combining both, S2 must be exactly 9.\n\nSo S2=9.\n\nThen, S3=99 -10*9=99-90=9.\n\nSo now we have S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.\n\nSo now, let's recap:\n\nS1= a + d=9\n\nS2= b + e=9\n\nS3= c + f=9\n\nAdditionally, from equation 2, R1 = S2 -1 =9-1=8.\n\nR1 is the sum of a + b + c=8.\n\nSimilarly, R2= d + e + f.\n\nFrom equation 2, 10 R1 + R2=99.\n\nSince R1=8, 10*8 + R2=99 \u2192 80 + R2=99 \u2192 R2=19.\n\nSo R2= d + e + f=19.\n\nNow, let's see what we have:\n\n1) a + d=9 \u2192 d=9 - a\n\n2) b + e=9 \u2192 e=9 - b\n\n3) c + f=9 \u2192 f=9 - c\n\n4) a + b + c=8\n\n5) d + e + f=19\n\nBut substituting d, e, f from 1,2,3 into equation5:\n\nd + e + f = (9 -a) + (9 -b) + (9 -c) = 27 - (a + b + c) =27 - R1=27 -8=19, which matches equation5. So that's consistent.\n\nSo now, all variables are expressed in terms of a, b, c.\n\nSo our problem now reduces to finding all possible values of a, b, c, d, e, f with the following constraints:\n\na: 0-9\n\nb:0-9\n\nc:0-9\n\nd=9 -a\n\ne=9 -b\n\nf=9 -c\n\nAdditionally,\n\na + b + c=8.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =8, where each of a, b, c is between 0 and 9, inclusive.\n\nBut since 8 is less than 3*9=27, and each variable can be at most 9, but 8 is much smaller, so all solutions where a, b, c are non-negative integers adding to 8, and each is <=9.\n\nWhich is the same as the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8, where 0 <= a, b, c <=9.\n\nThe number of solutions is C(8 +3 -1, 3 -1)=C(10,2)=45. But since 8 is less than 9, there's no need to subtract any cases where variables exceed 9.\n\nSo there are 45 possible solutions for (a, b, c). For each such solution, d=9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c.\n\nBut we also have to make sure that d, e, f are digits, i.e., between 0 and9.\n\nSince a, b, c are non-negative and <=9, d=9 -a is between 0 and9, same for e and f.\n\nSo each solution for a, b, c gives a valid d, e, f.\n\nThus, the number of possible grids is 45.",

So, the only possible U is 9, because for U=9, 10V + W=99, which is possible.\n\nSo, U=9, V=9, W=9.\n\nBecause 10V + W=99 implies V=9, W=9. Because 10V + W=99, so V must be 9, and then W=9.\n\nSo, U=9, V=9, W=9.\n\nSo, from equation 2, U=9, V=9, W=9.\n\nWhich means:\n\nA + D =9,\n\nB + E =9,\n\nC + F=9.\n\nGreat, that simplifies things.\n\nNow, going back to equation 1: 10S + T =99, where S= A + B + C, T= D + E + F.\n\nBut since from equation 2, we have A+D=9, B+E=9, C + F=9.\n\nSo, let me compute S and T.\n\nS = A + B + C.\n\nT = D + E + F.\n\nBut since A + D=9, so D=9 - A.\n\nSimilarly, E=9 - B, and F=9 - C.\n\nSo, T = D + E + F = (9 - A) + (9 - B) + (9 - C) = 27 - (A + B + C) =27 - S.\n\nSo, equation 1: 10S + T=99.\n\nBut T=27 - S, so substituting:\n\n10S + (27 - S) =99.\n\nSimplify:\n\n10S +27 - S=99 =>9S +27=99.\n\nSubtract 27 from both sides:\n\n9S=72.\n\nDivide both sides by 9:\n\nS=8.\n\nSo, S=8, which is A + B + C=8.\n\nAnd T=27 - S=19.\n\nSo, the sum of the digits in the bottom row, D + E + F=19.\n\nBut since D=9 - A, E=9 - B, F=9 - C,\n\nSo, D + E + F= (9 - A) + (9 - B) + (9 - C)=27 - (A + B + C)=27 -8=19, which checks out.\n\nSo, now the problem reduces to finding the number of 2x3 grids where:\n\n1. A + D =9, B + E=9, C + F=9.\n\n2. A + B + C=8.\n\nAnd each of A, B, C, D, E, F is a digit (0-9).\n\nSo, the approach is to find the number of possible (A, B, C) such that A + B + C=8, and then for each such triplet, D, E, F are determined as D=9 - A, E=9 - B, F=9 - C. We need to ensure that D, E, F are also digits (i.e., between 0 and 9).\n\nSo, the problem becomes: how many non-negative integer solutions are there to A + B + C=8, where each of A, B, C is between 0 and 9 inclusive?\n\nBecause once we have A, B, C, D, E, F are determined, and they must be digits (0-9). So, we have to make sure that D=9 - A >=0 and <=9, same for E and F.\n\nBut since A + B + C=8, and each of A, B, C is at least 0, D=9 - A can be as high as 9 (if A=0) and as low as 1 (if A=8). So, D is between 1 and 9, which is valid. Similarly for E and F: since B and C are at least 0, E=9 - B >=0 (since B <=8, because A + B + C=8, so B <=8, so E=9 - B >=1). Similarly, F=9 - C >=1.\n\nSo, all D, E, F will automatically be between 1 and 9, so they are valid digits. So, we don't have to worry about D, E, F being out of range because A, B, C are non-negative and sum to 8.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible grids is equal to the number of non-negative integer solutions to A + B + C=8, with each of A, B, C being between 0 and 9. Since 8 is less than 3*9=27, and each variable can be at most 8 (since they are non-negative and sum to 8), so each variable is automatically less than 9. So, all solutions are valid.\n\nSo, the number of solutions is the number of non-negative integer solutions to A + B + C=8, which is a classic stars and bars problem.\n\nThe formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions to x1 + x2 + ... + xn =k is (k + n -1) choose (n -1). So, here n=3, k=8.\n\nSo, the number of solutions is (8 + 3 -1) choose (3 -1) = (10 choose 2) = 45.",

So, from the first equation, each pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) must sum to 9. So, each pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) are digits that add up to 9.\n\nSo, A + D = 9\n\nB + E = 9\n\nC + F = 9\n\nThat's a big simplification.

Let me denote S1 = A + B + C and S2 = D + E + F. Then the equation becomes:\n\n10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nSo, 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nBut we also know from the first set of equations that A + D =9, B + E=9, C + F=9. So, if I add A + D + B + E + C + F = 27.\n\nWhich is, (A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 27\n\nSo, S1 + S2 = 27\n\nBut from the second equation, 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. S1 + S2 = 27\n\n2. 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n(10*S1 + S2) - (S1 + S2) = 99 - 27\n\nWhich gives:\n\n9*S1 = 72\n\nSo, S1 = 72 / 9 = 8\n\nThen, from the first equation, S2 = 27 - S1 = 27 -8=19\n\nSo, S1 = 8, S2=19\n\nSo, the sum of A + B + C =8, and the sum of D + E + F=19.\n\nSo, now, let me recap:\n\nWe have the following conditions:\n\n1. A + D = 9\n\n2. B + E = 9\n\n3. C + F = 9\n\n4. A + B + C =8\n\n5. D + E + F=19\n\nSo, from these, we can model the problem as:\n\nWe have variables A, B, C, D, E, F, each from 0 to9, such that:\n\nA + D =9\n\nB + E=9\n\nC + F=9\n\nA + B + C=8\n\nD + E + F=19\n\nSo, now I can approach this by first considering the possible values for (A, D), (B, E), (C, F) such that each pair sums to 9.\n\nEach pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) are pairs of digits that add up to 9. For each such pair, A can range from 0 to9, and D=9 -A, but since D must be a digit, A can be from 0 to9, but D=9-A must also be a digit, so A can be 0 to9.\n\nSimilarly for B and E, and C and F.\n\nSo, for each of the three pairs, there are 10 possible combinations (since A can be 0-9, D is 9-A, same for others). So, if there were no other constraints, each pair would have 10 possibilities, so total 10^3 =1000 possibilities. But we have the additional constraints that A + B + C=8 and D + E + F=19.\n\nHmm, so I need to count the number of triplets (A,B,C) and (D,E,F) such that:\n\nA + B + C=8\n\nD + E + F=19\n\nAnd also, D=9\u2212A, E=9\u2212B, F=9\u2212C",

For each such pair, A can range from 0 to9, and D=9 -A, but since D must be a digit, A can be from 0 to9, but D=9-A must also be a digit, so A can be 0 to9.\n\nSimilarly for B and E, and C and F.\n\nSo, for each of the three pairs, there are 10 possible combinations (since A can be 0-9, D is 9-A, same for others). So, if there were no other constraints, each pair would have 10 possibilities, so total 10^3 =1000 possibilities.

But in this case, N1 + N2 is 999, so:\n\nLet me think in terms of digits:\n\n- The units place: c + f must end with 9. So, c + f = 9 or 19, but since c and f are single digits, their sum can be at most 18 (9+9). So, c + f =9 or 19 is not possible because 19 would require each to be 10, which isn't allowed. So, c + f =9.\n\nSimilarly, the tens place: b + e + carryover from units place must equal 9. Since carryover from units is 0 (because c+f=9), so b + e =9.\n\nThe hundreds place: a + d + carryover from tens place must equal 9. Again, carryover from tens is 0 (since b + e=9), so a + d=9.\n\nSo, that gives us:\n\n1. c + f =9  \n2. b + e =9  \n3. a + d =9  \n\nAnd the thousands place? Well, since N1 and N2 are both three-digit numbers, their sum can't have a thousands digit. So, any carryover from the hundreds place must be zero. Since a and d are digits (0-9), their sum is 9, which is less than 10, so no carryover.\n\nSo, from the first equation, we get that:\n\nc + f=9  \nb + e=9  \na + d=9  \n\nSo, these are three equations.\n\nNow, moving on to the second condition: 10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) =99.\n\nLet me write S1 = a + b + c, S2 = d + e + f.\n\nSo, 10*S1 + S2 =99.\n\nBut from the first equations, we have:\n\na + d =9  \nb + e =9  \nc + f =9  \n\nWhich implies that:\n\nd=9 -a  \ne=9 -b  \nf=9 -c  \n\nSo, substituting into S2:\n\nS2 = d + e + f = (9 -a) + (9 -b) + (9 -c) = 27 - (a + b + c) =27 - S1.\n\nSo, substituting into the second equation:\n\n10*S1 + (27 - S1) =99  \nSimplify: 10S1 +27 - S1 =99  \nWhich is: 9S1 +27 =99  \nSubtract 27: 9S1=72  \nDivide by 9: S1=8\n\nSo, S1=8, which is a + b + c=8.\n\nAnd since S2=27 - S1=27 -8=19.\n\nSo, now we have:\n\na + b + c=8\n\nd=9 -a  \ne=9 -b  \nf=9 -c\n\nAlso, since d, e, f are digits, 0\u2264d,e,f\u22649. Because a, b, c are digits, 0\u2264a,b,c\u22649, so d=9-a will be \u22650 when a\u22649, which it is. So, d,e,f are all valid digits as long as a,b,c are digits.\n\nSo, our problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8, where a, b, c are digits (i.e., 0\u2264a,b,c\u22649).\n\nEach such solution will correspond to a unique grid, since d, e, f are determined by a, b, c.\n\nSo, the number of solutions is the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8, with a,b,c each between 0 and 9.\n\nBut since 8 is less than 10, and each variable can take 0-9, all solutions will satisfy 0\u2264a,b,c\u22649, so we don't have to worry about the upper limits.\n\nThe number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8 is C(8 + 3 -1, 3 -1) = C(10,2)=45.",

So, from the first equation, each pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) must sum to 9.

So, A and D are digits that sum to 9, same for B and E, and C and F.\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: AD + BE + CF = 99.\n\nEach of these is a two-digit number:\n\nAD = 10*A + D\n\nBE = 10*B + E\n\nCF = 10*C + F\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\n(10*A + D) + (10*B + E) + (10*C + F) = 99\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99\n\nHmm, interesting. Let me denote S1 = A + B + C and S2 = D + E + F. Then the equation becomes:\n\n10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nSo, 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nBut we also know from the first set of equations that A + D =9, B + E=9, C + F=9. So, if I add A + D + B + E + C + F = 27.\n\nWhich is, (A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 27\n\nSo, S1 + S2 = 27\n\nBut from the second equation, 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. S1 + S2 = 27\n\n2. 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n(10*S1 + S2) - (S1 + S2) = 99 - 27\n\nWhich gives:\n\n9*S1 = 72\n\nSo, S1 = 72 / 9 = 8\n\nThen, from the first equation, S2 = 27 - S1 = 27 -8=19\n\nSo, S1 = 8, S2=19\n\nSo, the sum of A + B + C =8, and the sum of D + E + F=19.\n\nSo, now, let me recap:\n\nWe have the following conditions:\n\n1. A + D = 9\n\n2. B + E = 9\n\n3. C + F = 9\n\n4. A + B + C =8\n\n5. D + E + F=19\n\nSo, from these, we can model the problem as:\n\nWe have variables A, B, C, D, E, F, each from 0 to9, such that:\n\nA + D =9\n\nB + E=9\n\nC + F=9\n\nA + B + C=8\n\nD + E + F=19\n\nSo, now I can approach this by first considering the possible values for (A, D), (B, E), (C, F) such that each pair sums to 9.\n\nEach pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) are pairs of digits that add up to 9. For each such pair, A can range from 0 to9, and D=9 -A, but since D must be a digit, A can be from 0 to9, but D=9-A must also be a digit, so A can be 0 to9.\n\nSimilarly for B and E, and C and F.\n\nSo, for each of the three pairs, there are 10 possible combinations (since A can be 0-9, D is 9-A, same for others). So, if there were no other constraints, each pair would have 10 possibilities, so total 10^3 =1000 possibilities. But we have the additional constraints that A + B + C=8 and D + E + F=19.\n\nHmm, so I need to count the number of triplets (A,B,C) and (D,E,F) such that:\n\nA + B + C=8\n\nD + E + F=19\n\nAnd also, D=9\u2212A, E=9\u2212B, F=9\u2212C",

Let me think differently.\n\nSince S1=9, equation 1 simplifies to 10 S2 + S3=99.\n\nNow, equation 2 is 10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f)=99.\n\nBut (a + b + c) is the sum of the first row, and (d + e + f) is the sum of the second row. Let me denote R1 = a + b + c and R2 = d + e + f.\n\nSo equation 2 becomes 10 R1 + R2 =99.\n\nBut R1 + R2 is the total sum of all digits in the grid, which is (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = S1 + S2 + S3.\n\nSo R1 + R2 = S1 + S2 + S3.\n\nBut from equation 1, S1=9, and 10 S2 + S3=99.\n\nSo S3=99 -10 S2.\n\nSo R1 + R2 = 9 + S2 + (99 -10 S2) = 9 + 99 -9 S2 = 108 -9 S2.\n\nBut from equation 2, 10 R1 + R2=99.\n\nSo now, I have two equations:\n\n1) R1 + R2 = 108 -9 S2\n\n2) 10 R1 + R2 =99\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(10 R1 + R2) - (R1 + R2) )= 99 - (108 -9 S2)\n\n9 R1 = 99 - 108 +9 S2\n\n9 R1 = -9 +9 S2\n\nDivide both sides by 9:\n\nR1 = -1 + S2\n\nSo R1 = S2 -1.\n\nBut R1 is the sum of a, b, c, which are digits. So R1 can be from 0 to 27 (since each of a, b, c can be 0-9, sum up to 27). Similarly, S2 = b + e, where b and e are digits, so S2 ranges from 0 to 18.\n\nSince R1 = S2 -1, and R1 >=0, then S2 must be at least 1, because R1 can't be negative. So S2 >=1.\n\nSo now, R1 = S2 -1.\n\nNow, from equation 1: 10 S2 + S3 =99.\n\nBut S3 = c + f.\n\nSo S3 =99 -10 S2.\n\nBut since S3 is the sum of two digits, c and f, which are each between 0 and9, S3 must be between 0 and 18. So 0 <= S3 <=18.\n\nSo 99 -10 S2 must be between 0 and 18.\n\nSo 0 <=99 -10 S2 <=18\n\nLet me solve for S2:\n\nFirst, lower bound:\n\n99 -10 S2 >=0\n\n10 S2 <=99\n\nS2 <=9.9. Since S2 is integer, S2 <=9.\n\nUpper bound:\n\n99 -10 S2 <=18\n\n99 -18 <=10 S2\n\n81 <=10 S2\n\nS2 >=8.1. So since S2 is integer, S2 >=9.\n\nSo combining both, S2 must be exactly 9.\n\nSo S2=9.\n\nThen, S3=99 -10*9=99-90=9.\n\nSo now we have S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.\n\nSo now, let's recap:\n\nS1= a + d=9\n\nS2= b + e=9\n\nS3= c + f=9\n\nAdditionally, from equation 2, R1 = S2 -1 =9-1=8.\n\nR1 is the sum of a + b + c=8.\n\nSimilarly, R2= d + e + f.\n\nFrom equation 2, 10 R1 + R2=99.\n\nSince R1=8, 10*8 + R2=99 \u2192 80 + R2=99 \u2192 R2=19.\n\nSo R2= d + e + f=19.\n\nNow, let's see what we have:\n\n1) a + d=9 \u2192 d=9 - a\n\n2) b + e=9 \u2192 e=9 - b\n\n3) c + f=9 \u2192 f=9 - c\n\n4) a + b + c=8\n\n5) d + e + f=19\n\nBut substituting d, e, f from 1,2,3 into equation5:\n\nd + e + f = (9 -a) + (9 -b) + (9 -c) = 27 - (a + b + c) =27 - R1=27 -8=19, which matches equation5. So that's consistent.\n\nSo now, all variables are expressed in terms of a, b, c.\n\nSo our problem now reduces to finding all possible values of a, b, c, d, e, f with the following constraints:\n\na: 0-9\n\nb:0-9\n\nc:0-9\n\nd=9 -a\n\ne=9 -b\n\nf=9 -c\n\nAdditionally,\n\na + b + c=8.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =8, where each of a, b, c is between 0 and 9, inclusive.\n\nBut since 8 is less than 3*9=27, and each variable can be at most 9, but 8 is much smaller, so all solutions where a, b, c are non-negative integers adding to 8, and each is <=9.\n\nWhich is the same as the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8, where 0 <= a, b, c <=9.\n\nThe number of solutions is C(8 +3 -1, 3 -1)=C(10,2)=45. But since 8 is less than 9, there's no need to subtract any cases where variables exceed 9.\n\nSo there are 45 possible solutions for (a, b, c). For each such solution, d=9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c.\n\nBut we also have to make sure that d, e, f are digits, i.e., between 0 and9.\n\nSince a, b, c are non-negative and <=9, d=9 -a is between 0 and9, same for e and f.\n\nSo each solution for a, b, c gives a valid d, e, f.\n\nThus, the number of possible grids is 45.",

          "text2": "Wait, is that correct? Let me check:\n\nIf A + D = 9, then 100*(A + D) = 900\n\nIf B + E = 9, then 10*(B + E) = 90\n\nIf C + F = 9, then (C + F) = 9\n\nAdding them together: 900 + 90 + 9 = 999, which is correct.\n\nSo, that's a key insight. So, from the first equation, each pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) must sum to 9. So, each pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) are digits that add up to 9.\n\nSo, A + D = 9\n\nB + E = 9\n\nC + F = 9\n\nThat's a big simplification. So, A and D are digits that sum to 9, same for B and E, and C and F.\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: AD + BE + CF = 99.\n\nEach of these is a two-digit number:\n\nAD = 10*A + D\n\nBE = 10*B + E\n\nCF = 10*C + F\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\n(10*A + D) + (10*B + E) + (10*C + F) = 99\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99\n\nHmm, interesting. Let me denote S1 = A + B + C and S2 = D + E + F. Then the equation becomes:\n\n10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nSo, 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nBut we also know from the first set of equations that A + D =9, B + E=9, C + F=9. So, if I add A + D + B + E + C + F = 27.\n\nWhich is, (A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 27\n\nSo, S1 + S2 = 27\n\nBut from the second equation, 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. S1 + S2 = 27\n\n2. 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n(10*S1 + S2) - (S1 + S2) = 99 - 27\n\nWhich gives:\n\n9*S1 = 72\n\nSo, S1 = 72 / 9 = 8\n\nThen, from the first equation, S2 = 27 - S1 = 27 -8=19\n\nSo, S1 = 8, S2=19\n\nSo, the sum of A + B + C =8, and the sum of D + E + F=19.\n\nSo, now, let me recap:\n\nWe have the following conditions:\n\n1. A + D = 9\n\n2. B + E = 9\n\n3. C + F = 9\n\n4. A + B + C =8\n\n5. D + E + F=19\n\nSo, from these, we can model the problem as:\n\nWe have variables A, B, C, D, E, F, each from 0 to9, such that:\n\nA + D =9\n\nB + E=9\n\nC + F=9\n\nA + B + C=8\n\nD + E + F=19\n\nSo, now I can approach this by first considering the possible values for (A, D), (B, E), (C, F) such that each pair sums to 9.\n\nEach pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) are pairs of digits that add up to 9. For each such pair, A can range from 0 to9, and D=9 -A, but since D must be a digit, A can be from 0 to9, but D=9-A must also be a digit, so A can be 0 to9.\n\nSimilarly for B and E, and C and F.\n\nSo, for each of the three pairs, there are 10 possible combinations (since A can be 0-9, D is 9-A, same for others). So, if there were no other constraints, each pair would have 10 possibilities, so total 10^3 =1000 possibilities. But we have the additional constraints that A + B + C=8 and D + E + F=19.\n\nHmm, so I need to count the number of triplets (A,B,C) and (D,E,F) such that:\n\nA + B + C=8\n\nD + E + F=19\n\nAnd also, D=9\u2212A, E=9\u2212B, F=9\u2212C",

So, for each column i, the top digit plus the bottom digit equals 9.\n\nSo, that gives us constraints on the digits.\n\nNow, the second condition is ad + be + cf =99.\n\nSince a + d =9, let me express d=9 -a.\n\nSimilarly, e=9 -b,\n\nf=9 -c.\n\nSubstituting into the second condition:\n\nad + be + cf=99.\n\nSo, a*(9 - a) + b*(9 - b) + c*(9 - c) =99.\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\na*(9 -a) =9a -a\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, for b and c.\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\n(9a -a\u00b2) + (9b -b\u00b2) + (9c -c\u00b2) =99.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n9(a + b + c) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) =99.\n\nHmm, let's denote S =a + b + c.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n9S - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) =99.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =9S -99.\n\nWe need to find a, b, c such that:\n\na, b, c are digits (0-9),\n\na + d=9 => d=9 -a,\n\nb + e=9 => e=9 -b,\n\nc + f=9 => f=9 -c,\n\nand a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =9S -99, where S =a + b + c.\n\nSo, let me see. Since a, b, c are digits from 0 to 9, their sum S can range from 0 to 27.\n\nBut let's see, the equation a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =9S -99.\n\nSince a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 must be non-negative, 9S -99 \u22650 => S \u2265 11.\n\nSo, S can be from 11 to 27.\n\nBut let's see, what is the maximum value of a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2?\n\nSince each of a,b,c is at most 9, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 \u2264 81 + 81 +81=243.\n\nSimilarly, 9S -99, since S can be up to 27, 9*27 -99=243-99=144.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 can be up to 243, but in our case, 9S -99 can be up to 144. So, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 \u2264144.\n\nSo, for S from 11 to 27, 9S -99 must be equal to a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding all possible triples (a,b,c) where a, b, c are digits (0-9), a + b + c = S, and a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =9S -99.\n\nSo, the strategy is to find all possible S from 11 to 27 where 9S -99 can be expressed as the sum of squares of three digits a, b, c, and where a + b + c = S.\n\nSo, let's compute for each S from 11 to 27:\n\nFor each S, compute 9S -99, which is the target sum of squares, and check if there exist a, b, c (digits) such that a + b + c = S and a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =9S -99.",

For each such pair, A can range from 0 to9, and D=9 -A, but since D must be a digit, A can be from 0 to9, but D=9-A must also be a digit, so A can be 0 to9.\n\nSimilarly for B and E, and C and F.\n\nSo, for each of the three pairs, there are 10 possible combinations (since A can be 0-9, D is 9-A, same for others).

But in this case, N1 + N2 is 999, so:\n\nLet me think in terms of digits:\n\n- The units place: c + f must end with 9. So, c + f = 9 or 19, but since c and f are single digits, their sum can be at most 18 (9+9). So, c + f =9 or 19 is not possible because 19 would require each to be 10, which isn't allowed. So, c + f =9.\n\nSimilarly, the tens place: b + e + carryover from units place must equal 9. Since carryover from units is 0 (because c+f=9), so b + e =9.\n\nThe hundreds place: a + d + carryover from tens place must equal 9. Again, carryover from tens is 0 (since b + e=9), so a + d=9.\n\nSo, that gives us:\n\n1. c + f =9  \n2. b + e =9  \n3. a + d =9  \n\nAnd the thousands place? Well, since N1 and N2 are both three-digit numbers, their sum can't have a thousands digit. So, any carryover from the hundreds place must be zero. Since a and d are digits (0-9), their sum is 9, which is less than 10, so no carryover.\n\nSo, from the first equation, we get that:\n\nc + f=9  \nb + e=9  \na + d=9  \n\nSo, these are three equations.\n\nNow, moving on to the second condition: 10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) =99.\n\nLet me write S1 = a + b + c, S2 = d + e + f.\n\nSo, 10*S1 + S2 =99.\n\nBut from the first equations, we have:\n\na + d =9  \nb + e =9  \nc + f =9  \n\nWhich implies that:\n\nd=9 -a  \ne=9 -b  \nf=9 -c  \n\nSo, substituting into S2:\n\nS2 = d + e + f = (9 -a) + (9 -b) + (9 -c) = 27 - (a + b + c) =27 - S1.\n\nSo, substituting into the second equation:\n\n10*S1 + (27 - S1) =99  \nSimplify: 10S1 +27 - S1 =99  \nWhich is: 9S1 +27 =99  \nSubtract 27: 9S1=72  \nDivide by 9: S1=8\n\nSo, S1=8, which is a + b + c=8.\n\nAnd since S2=27 - S1=27 -8=19.\n\nSo, now we have:\n\na + b + c=8\n\nd=9 -a  \ne=9 -b  \nf=9 -c\n\nAlso, since d, e, f are digits, 0\u2264d,e,f\u22649. Because a, b, c are digits, 0\u2264a,b,c\u22649, so d=9-a will be \u22650 when a\u22649, which it is. So, d,e,f are all valid digits as long as a,b,c are digits.\n\nSo, our problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8, where a, b, c are digits (i.e., 0\u2264a,b,c\u22649).\n\nEach such solution will correspond to a unique grid, since d, e, f are determined by a, b, c.\n\nSo, the number of solutions is the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8, with a,b,c each between 0 and 9.\n\nBut since 8 is less than 10, and each variable can take 0-9, all solutions will satisfy 0\u2264a,b,c\u22649, so we don't have to worry about the upper limits.\n\nThe number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8 is C(8 + 3 -1, 3 -1) = C(10,2)=45.",

So, from the first equation, each pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) must sum to 9.

So, A and D are digits that sum to 9, same for B and E, and C and F.\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: AD + BE + CF = 99.\n\nEach of these is a two-digit number:\n\nAD = 10*A + D\n\nBE = 10*B + E\n\nCF = 10*C + F\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\n(10*A + D) + (10*B + E) + (10*C + F) = 99\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99\n\nHmm, interesting. Let me denote S1 = A + B + C and S2 = D + E + F. Then the equation becomes:\n\n10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nSo, 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nBut we also know from the first set of equations that A + D =9, B + E=9, C + F=9. So, if I add A + D + B + E + C + F = 27.\n\nWhich is, (A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 27\n\nSo, S1 + S2 = 27\n\nBut from the second equation, 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. S1 + S2 = 27\n\n2. 10*S1 + S2 = 99\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n(10*S1 + S2) - (S1 + S2) = 99 - 27\n\nWhich gives:\n\n9*S1 = 72\n\nSo, S1 = 72 / 9 = 8\n\nThen, from the first equation, S2 = 27 - S1 = 27 -8=19\n\nSo, S1 = 8, S2=19\n\nSo, the sum of A + B + C =8, and the sum of D + E + F=19.\n\nSo, now, let me recap:\n\nWe have the following conditions:\n\n1. A + D = 9\n\n2. B + E = 9\n\n3. C + F = 9\n\n4. A + B + C =8\n\n5. D + E + F=19\n\nSo, from these, we can model the problem as:\n\nWe have variables A, B, C, D, E, F, each from 0 to9, such that:\n\nA + D =9\n\nB + E=9\n\nC + F=9\n\nA + B + C=8\n\nD + E + F=19\n\nSo, now I can approach this by first considering the possible values for (A, D), (B, E), (C, F) such that each pair sums to 9.\n\nEach pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) are pairs of digits that add up to 9. For each such pair, A can range from 0 to9, and D=9 -A, but since D must be a digit, A can be from 0 to9, but D=9-A must also be a digit, so A can be 0 to9.\n\nSimilarly for B and E, and C and F.\n\nSo, for each of the three pairs, there are 10 possible combinations (since A can be 0-9, D is 9-A, same for others). So, if there were no other constraints, each pair would have 10 possibilities, so total 10^3 =1000 possibilities. But we have the additional constraints that A + B + C=8 and D + E + F=19.\n\nHmm, so I need to count the number of triplets (A,B,C) and (D,E,F) such that:\n\nA + B + C=8\n\nD + E + F=19\n\nAnd also, D=9\u2212A, E=9\u2212B, F=9\u2212C",

Yes, that fits.\n\nSo, each column sums to 9.\n\nSo, this is a key point. So, for each column i, the top digit plus the bottom digit equals 9.\n\nSo, that gives us constraints on the digits.\n\nNow, the second condition is ad + be + cf =99.\n\nSince a + d =9, let me express d=9 -a.\n\nSimilarly, e=9 -b,\n\nf=9 -c.\n\nSubstituting into the second condition:\n\nad + be + cf=99.\n\nSo, a*(9 - a) + b*(9 - b) + c*(9 - c) =99.\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\na*(9 -a) =9a -a\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, for b and c.\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\n(9a -a\u00b2) + (9b -b\u00b2) + (9c -c\u00b2) =99.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n9(a + b + c) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) =99.\n\nHmm, let's denote S =a + b + c.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n9S - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) =99.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =9S -99.\n\nWe need to find a, b, c such that:\n\na, b, c are digits (0-9),\n\na + d=9 => d=9 -a,\n\nb + e=9 => e=9 -b,\n\nc + f=9 => f=9 -c,\n\nand a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =9S -99, where S =a + b + c.\n\nSo, let me see. Since a, b, c are digits from 0 to 9, their sum S can range from 0 to 27.\n\nBut let's see, the equation a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =9S -99.\n\nSince a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 must be non-negative, 9S -99 \u22650 => S \u2265 11.\n\nSo, S can be from 11 to 27.\n\nBut let's see, what is the maximum value of a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2?\n\nSince each of a,b,c is at most 9, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 \u2264 81 + 81 +81=243.\n\nSimilarly, 9S -99, since S can be up to 27, 9*27 -99=243-99=144.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 can be up to 243, but in our case, 9S -99 can be up to 144. So, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 \u2264144.\n\nSo, for S from 11 to 27, 9S -99 must be equal to a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding all possible triples (a,b,c) where a, b, c are digits (0-9), a + b + c = S, and a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =9S -99.\n\nSo, the strategy is to find all possible S from 11 to 27 where 9S -99 can be expressed as the sum of squares of three digits a, b, c, and where a + b + c = S.\n\nSo, let's compute for each S from 11 to 27:\n\nFor each S, compute 9S -99, which is the target sum of squares, and check if there exist a, b, c (digits) such that a + b + c = S and a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =9S -99.",

The main point is that A + B + C = 8.\n\nSo, now the problem reduces to finding the number of possible digits A, B, C, D, E, F such that:\n\n- For each column i (1,2,3), digit i in top row plus digit i in bottom row equals 9. So, D=9\u2212A, E=9\u2212B, F=9\u2212C.\n\n- The sum of the top row digits A + B + C = 8.\n\nSo, the problem is now to find all possible triples (A,B,C) where each of A, B, C is a digit (0-9), their sum is 8, and then for each such triple, the digits D=9\u2212A, E=9\u2212B, F=9\u2212C must be digits (i.e., between 0 and 9).",

For each such pair, A can range from 0 to9, and D=9 -A, but since D must be a digit, A can be from 0 to9, but D=9-A must also be a digit, so A can be 0 to9.\n\nSimilarly for B and E, and C and F.\n\nSo, for each of the three pairs, there are 10 possible combinations (since A can be 0-9, D is 9-A, same for others). So, if there were no other constraints, each pair would have 10 possibilities, so total 10^3 =1000 possibilities. But we have the additional constraints that A + B + C=8 and D + E + F=19.\n\nHmm, so I need to count the number of triplets (A,B,C) and (D,E,F) such that:\n\nA + B + C=8\n\nD + E + F=19\n\nAnd also, D=9\u2212A, E=9\u2212B, F=9\u2212C",

The correct interpretation is that ad is the two-digit number formed by digits a and d, which is 10a + d.\n\nSimilarly, be is 10b + e, and cf is 10c + f.\n\nSo, the second condition is 10a +d +10b +e +10c +f=99.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f)=99.\n\nBut from the first condition, abc + def=999.\n\nWhich is 100a +10b +c +100d +10e +f=999.\n\nSo, now, we have two equations:\n\n1. 100a +10b +c +100d +10e +f=999.\n\n2. 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f)=99.\n\nLet me denote S =a + b + c,\n\nand T =d + e + f.\n\nSo, equation 2: 10S + T=99.\n\nEquation 1: Let me express it as:\n\n100a +10b +c +100d +10e +f =999.\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n100(a + d) +10(b + e) + (c + f)=999.\n\nBut earlier, we also had that a + d=9, b + e=9, c + f=9.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n100*9 +10*9 +9=900 +90 +9=999.\n\nWhich checks out.\n\nSo, from equation 2: 10S + T=99.\n\nBut S =a + b + c,\n\nand T =d + e + f.\n\nBut since a + d=9, d=9 -a,\n\nSimilarly, e=9 -b,\n\nf=9 -c.\n\nSo, T= d + e +f= (9 -a) + (9 -b) + (9 -c)=27 - (a + b + c)=27 - S.\n\nSo, T=27 - S.\n\nSubstituting into equation 2:\n\n10S + (27 - S)=99.\n\nSo,\n\n10S +27 - S =99,\n\n9S +27=99,\n\n9S=72,\n\nS=8.\n\nSo, S=8.\n\nTherefore, T=27 -8=19.\n\nSo, from equation 2, S=8.\n\nSo, now, we have:\n\n1. a + d=9,\n\n2. b + e=9,\n\n3. c + f=9,\n\n4. a + b + c=8,\n\n5. d + e + f=19.\n\nSince d=9 -a,\n\ne=9 -b,\n\nf=9 -c,\n\nSo, d + e +f=27 - (a + b + c)=27 -8=19, which is correct.\n\nSo, the key is now to find all possible digits a, b, c (0-9) such that a + b + c=8.\n\nEach a, b, c is between 0 and9, inclusive.\n\nBecause a + d=9, so d=9 -a, which must be a digit (0-9), so a can be from 0 to9.\n\nSimilarly for b and c.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8, where each of a, b, c is between 0 and9, inclusive.\n\nSince 8 is less than 3*9=27, and each variable can be at most 9, the constraints are automatically satisfied, because the maximum any single variable can be is 8, which is less than 9.\n\nSo, the number of solutions is the same as the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8, which is C(8 +3 -1, 3 -1)=C(10,2)=45.",

So, S1 must be 9.\n\nSo, S1 = 9.\n\nThen, Equation 1 becomes 100*9 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.\n\nWhich is 900 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.\n\nSo, 10*S2 + S3 = 99.\n\nHmm, that's another equation: 10*S2 + S3 = 99.\n\nNow, S2 and S3 are sums of two digits each. So, S2 can be between 0 and 18, and S3 can be between 0 and 18.\n\nSo, 10*S2 + S3 = 99. Let's think about possible values for S2 and S3.\n\n10*S2 + S3 = 99.\n\nSince S3 is a sum of two digits, it can be at most 18. So, 10*S2 + S3 can be at most 10*18 + 18 = 198. But in our case, it's 99, which is within that range.\n\nBut S3 = 99 - 10*S2.\n\nBut since S3 must be between 0 and 18, let's see what S2 can be:\n\n99 - 10*S2 >= 0 => S2 <= 9.9, so S2 <=9.\n\nAlso, S3 = 99 -10*S2 <=18 => 99 -10*S2 <=18 => -10*S2 <= -81 => 10*S2 >=81 => S2 >=8.1.\n\nSince S2 is an integer (sum of two digits), so S2 >=9.\n\nSo, S2 must be exactly 9.\n\nBecause S2 is an integer between 8.1 and 9.9, so S2=9.\n\nSo, S2=9, then S3=99 -10*9=9.\n\nSo, S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.\n\nSo, we have S1=9 (a + d=9), S2=9 (b + e=9), S3=9 (c + f=9).\n\nNow, from Equation 2: 10*Sum1 + Sum2 =99.\n\nBut Sum1 = a + b + c, and Sum2 = d + e + f.\n\nBut S1= a + d=9, S2= b + e=9, S3= c + f=9.\n\nSo, Sum1 = a + b + c, and Sum2 = d + e + f.\n\nBut Sum1 + Sum2 = (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = S1 + S2 + S3 = 9+9+9=27.\n\nSo, Sum1 + Sum2 =27.\n\nFrom Equation 2: 10*Sum1 + Sum2 =99.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1.
