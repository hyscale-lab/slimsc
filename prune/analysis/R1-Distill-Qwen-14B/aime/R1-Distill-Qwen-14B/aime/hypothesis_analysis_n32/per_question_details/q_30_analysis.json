          "text1": "Wait, but in the product above, it's product (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) which is the same as product ( -(1 + i - \u03c9^k) ), right? Because \u03c9^k - a = -(a - \u03c9^k). So, product_{k=0 to 12} (\u03c9^k - a) = product_{k=0 to 12} (-1)(a - \u03c9^k) = (-1)^13 * product_{k=0 to 12} (a - \u03c9^k) = - product_{k=0 to 12} (a - \u03c9^k) = - (a^13 - 1).\n\nSimilarly, for the other product, product_{k=0 to 12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the original product is:\n\n[ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ]\n\nWhich simplifies to [ - (1 + i)^13 + 1 ] * [ - (1 - i)^13 + 1 ].",
          "text2": "Wait, so let's consider the first product: product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)). Let me set x = 1 + i. Then the product is product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - x). But as I said, the product over all \u03c9^k of (x - \u03c9^k) is x^13 - 1. So product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 - 1. But our product is product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - x) = (-1)^13 * product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = - (x^13 - 1), because (-1)^13 is -1.\n\nSo, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - x) = - (x^13 - 1). So substituting x = 1 + i, it becomes -( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ). Similarly, for the other product with x = 1 - i, it becomes -( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ).\n\nTherefore, the original product is [ -( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ -( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13. Then subtract 1, multiply by (-1), and then multiply both together.\n\nI know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. Let's compute the modulus and argument of 1 + i. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) as well, and argument -\u03c0/4. So, 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * (-\u03c0/4)}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13. Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2). So, (sqrt(2))^13 = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents:\n\nFor 13 * \u03c0/4: 13 divided by 4 is 3.25, which is 3 + 1/4. So, 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, so 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0. So, e^{i * (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i * (\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, for 13 * (-\u03c0/4): 13 * (-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4. Let's add multiples of 2\u03c0 until it's within 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\n-13\u03c0/4 = -(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4. Adding 4\u03c0 (which is 8\u03c0/2 or 2*(2\u03c0)), wait, perhaps it's easier to add 2\u03c0 until it's positive.\n\n-13\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = -13\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4 = (-5\u03c0)/4. Still negative. Add another 2\u03c0: (-5\u03c0/4) + 8\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So e^{i * (-13\u03c0/4)} = e^{i * 3\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i5\u03c0/4} and (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i3\u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, e^{i5\u03c0/4} is equal to cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2). Similarly, e^{i3\u03c0/4} is cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2).\n\nSo, let's compute each term:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2) = 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2)(1 + i).\n\nSimplify that: 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2) = 64 * (- (2)/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, (1 + i)^13 = -64*(1 + i).",

So, if I set x = (1 + i), then the product from k=0 to 12 of (1 + i - \u03c9^k) is equal to (1 + i)^{13} - 1. Similarly, for x = (1 - i), the product from k=0 to 12 of (1 - i - \u03c9^k) is equal to (1 - i)^{13} - 1.\n\nBut in our case, each product is \u220f (\u03c9^k - c), where c is a constant.

So, since there are 13 terms, it's (-1)^{13} times the product of (c - \u03c9^k).\n\nTherefore, \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - c) = (-1)^{13} * \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k) = - \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k).\n\nBut \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k) = c^{13} - 1, because that's the factorization of x^{13} - 1. So, substituting c = 1 + i, we get \u220f (1 + i - \u03c9^k) = (1 + i)^{13} - 1.\n\nThus, \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = - [(1 + i)^{13} - 1].

So, that's the same as (-1)^13 times the product of (a - \u03c9^k), which is - (product of (a - \u03c9^k)) because 13 is odd. So, product (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 product (a - \u03c9^k) = - product (a - \u03c9^k).\n\nBut product (a - \u03c9^k) from k=0 to 12 is a^13 - 1.

But our product is product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - x) = (-1)^13 * product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = - (x^13 - 1), because (-1)^13 is -1.\n\nSo, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - x) = - (x^13 - 1).

But since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, so 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0.

Add another 2\u03c0: (-5\u03c0/4) + 8\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4.

Let's see.\n\nFirst, let me note that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus of (1 + i) is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4, since it's in the first quadrant, 45 degrees.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) as well, and the argument is -\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (1 + i) can be written as sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}, and (1 - i) is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute [sqrt(2)]^13. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so [2^{1/2}]^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).

So, the entire product we're looking for is [(1 + i)^13 - 1] * [(1 - i)^13 - 1].\n\nSo, now my task reduces to computing this expression and then taking the result modulo 1000.\n\nLet me compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 first.\n\nI know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form.

The angle is 45 degrees, or \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has the same magnitude, sqrt(2), but the angle is -\u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13 first. sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2). So, (sqrt(2))^13 = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4} and e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 is equal to (3\u03c0/4) + (3\u03c0/4) + (3\u03c0/4) + \u03c0/4?",

So, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = ((1 + i)^13 - 1)/( (1 + i) - 1 ) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / (i).\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) = ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / (-i).\n\nSo, let's compute these two terms separately.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nWe know that 1 + i can be represented in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2), and argument -\u03c0/4, so 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i*13\u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13:\n\nsqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let me compute e^{i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSince 13\u03c0/4 is more than 2\u03c0, let's subtract multiples of 2\u03c0 to find an equivalent angle.\n\n13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4.\n\nBut 3\u03c0 is equal to \u03c0 + 2\u03c0, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 is \u03c0/4 plus an odd multiple of \u03c0. But when considering this on the unit circle, e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0. So, 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0*(1) = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Similarly, 5\u03c0/4 is in the third quadrant, which is \u03c0 + \u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{i*(5\u03c0/4)} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i*13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i*(5\u03c0/4)} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nLet me compute each of these:\n\nFirst, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nMultiplying sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = (-2)/2 = -1.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = (-i * 2)/2 = -i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * [ -1 - i ].\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nAgain, sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = -1, and sqrt(2)*(i sqrt(2)/2) = i.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = 64* [ -1 + i ].\n\nSo now, let's compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).\n\n\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) = [ (-64 - 64i) - 1 ] / (i) = [ -65 - 64i ] / i.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) = [ (-64 + 64i) - 1 ] / (-i) = [ -65 + 64i ] / (-i).",

Then, expressed the entire product as two separate products over k, each being the product of (\u03c9^k - c) where c is 1+i or 1-i.\n\nThen, using the fact that the product of (x - \u03c9^k) over k is x^13 -1, so replacing x with 1 + i and 1 - i, and considering the negative sign from the factorization, since the product is (\u03c9^k - c) = - (c - \u03c9^k).\n\nThen, computed (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, which involved converting to polar form and using De Moivre's theorem.

          "text1": "Wait, let me check if I did everything correctly. So, starting from the product, I converted each term into (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)), then recognized the product over k is the product of (x - \u03c9^k) evaluated at x = 1 + i and x =1 - i, then used the fact that product (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 -1. Then, I accounted for the negative sign because it was (\u03c9^k - x) instead of (x - \u03c9^k), leading to a negative. Then, I computed (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 by converting to polar form, raised to the 13th power, then converted back. Then, subtracted 1, multiplied the two, and ended up with 8321. Then, mod 1000 gives 321.\n\nHmm, seems correct, but let me verify each step.\n\nFirst, the substitution z = \u03c9^k, so the term becomes 2 - 2z + z\u00b2, which factors into (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)). So, correct.\n\nThen, the product over k of (\u03c9^k - a) is equal to (-1)^13 times product (a - \u03c9^k) which is - (a^13 - 1). So, that's correct because product (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 -1.\n\nSo, each product is -(a^13 -1). So, the entire product is [ - ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ] which is equal to ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ). Correct.\n\nThen, computing (1 + i)^13. Since 1 + i is sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}, raising to 13 gives (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i13\u03c0/4}. (sqrt(2))^13 is 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64*sqrt(2). Correct.\n\nThen, 13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is \u03c0/4 more than 3\u03c0, but since e^{i\u03b8} is 2\u03c0 periodic, 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 5\u03c0/4 because 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2. Correct.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * ( -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64*(-1) - 64i. So, -64 -64i.",
          "text2": "Wait, that's right! Because the product (x - 1)(x - \u03c9)(x - \u03c9\u00b2)...(x - \u03c9\u00b9\u00b2) = x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1. So, if we set x = a, then the product from k=0 to 12 of (a - \u03c9^k) = a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1. That's a key insight.\n\nSo, in this case, for the first product, we have Product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = [(1 + i)^13 - 1]. Similarly, Product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = [(1 - i)^13 - 1]. So, the entire product we're looking for is [(1 + i)^13 - 1] * [(1 - i)^13 - 1].\n\nSo, now my task reduces to computing this expression and then taking the result modulo 1000.\n\nLet me compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 first.\n\nI know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. Let me calculate its magnitude and angle. The magnitude is sqrt(1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2) = sqrt(2). The angle is 45 degrees, or \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has the same magnitude, sqrt(2), but the angle is -\u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13 first. sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2). So, (sqrt(2))^13 = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4} and e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 is equal to (3\u03c0/4) + (3\u03c0/4) + (3\u03c0/4) + \u03c0/4?",

Angle: 13*(\u03c0/4) = 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is \u03c0/4 more than 3\u03c0, which is equivalent to \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4, as I had earlier. So cos(5\u03c0/4)=-sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4)=-sqrt(2)/2. So, 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64*(-1 - i). Which is -64 -64i.

But as I said, the product over all \u03c9^k of (x - \u03c9^k) is x^13 - 1. So product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 - 1. But our product is product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - x) = (-1)^13 * product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = - (x^13 - 1), because (-1)^13 is -1.\n\nSo, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - x) = - (x^13 - 1). So substituting x = 1 + i, it becomes -( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ). Similarly, for the other product with x = 1 - i, it becomes -( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ).\n\nTherefore, the original product is [ -( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ -( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13. Then subtract 1, multiply by (-1), and then multiply both together.\n\nI know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. Let's compute the modulus and argument of 1 + i. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) as well, and argument -\u03c0/4. So, 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * (-\u03c0/4)}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13. Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2). So, (sqrt(2))^13 = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents:\n\nFor 13 * \u03c0/4: 13 divided by 4 is 3.25, which is 3 + 1/4. So, 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, so 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0. So, e^{i * (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i * (\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, for 13 * (-\u03c0/4): 13 * (-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4. Let's add multiples of 2\u03c0 until it's within 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\n-13\u03c0/4 = -(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4. Adding 4\u03c0 (which is 8\u03c0/2 or 2*(2\u03c0)), wait, perhaps it's easier to add 2\u03c0 until it's positive.\n\n-13\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = -13\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4 = (-5\u03c0)/4. Still negative. Add another 2\u03c0: (-5\u03c0/4) + 8\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So e^{i * (-13\u03c0/4)} = e^{i * 3\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i5\u03c0/4} and (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i3\u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, e^{i5\u03c0/4} is equal to cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2).

But since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, so 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0.

So, e^{i*5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i *13 \u03c0/4} is the same as e^{-i *5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ]\n\nSimilarly,\n\n(1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ]\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst, (1 + i)^13:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ]\n\nLet me compute the multiplication inside:\n\nsqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = (-2)/2 = -1\n\nsqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = (-i * 2)/2 = -i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * ( -1 - i ) = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ]\n\nCompute inside:\n\nsqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -1\n\nsqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2) = i * 2 / 2 = i\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * ( -1 + i ) = -64 + 64i.\n\nSo, now, (a^13 - 1) = ( -64 -64i -1 ) = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (b^13 -1) = (-64 +64i -1 ) = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, the product is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i). That's a product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is the square of the modulus.\n\nSo, the modulus squared is (-65)^2 + (64)^2.",

Therefore, product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) = (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(a - 1).\n\nSo, going back to our problem, the product we're trying to compute is:\n\nproduct_{k=1}^{12} [(\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i))] = [product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)))] = \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).\n\nTherefore, the entire product is equal to \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).\n\nNow, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(x - 1). So, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = ((1 + i)^13 - 1)/( (1 + i) - 1 ) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / (i).\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) = ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / (-i).\n\nSo, let's compute these two terms separately.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nWe know that 1 + i can be represented in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2), and argument -\u03c0/4, so 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i*13\u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13:\n\nsqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let me compute e^{i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSince 13\u03c0/4 is more than 2\u03c0, let's subtract multiples of 2\u03c0 to find an equivalent angle.\n\n13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4.\n\nBut 3\u03c0 is equal to \u03c0 + 2\u03c0, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 is \u03c0/4 plus an odd multiple of \u03c0. But when considering this on the unit circle, e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0. So, 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0*(1) = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Similarly, 5\u03c0/4 is in the third quadrant, which is \u03c0 + \u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{i*(5\u03c0/4)} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i*13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i*(5\u03c0/4)} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nLet me compute each of these:\n\nFirst, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nMultiplying sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = (-2)/2 = -1.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = (-i * 2)/2 = -i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * [ -1 - i ].\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nAgain, sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = -1, and sqrt(2)*(i sqrt(2)/2) = i.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = 64* [ -1 + i ].\n\nSo now, let's compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).\n\n\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) = [ (-64 - 64i) - 1 ] / (i) = [ -65 - 64i ] / i.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) = [ (-64 + 64i) - 1 ] / (-i) = [ -65 + 64i ] / (-i).",

Since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0. So, it's equivalent to \u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is 5\u03c0/4.",
          "text2": "Wait, is that right? Let me check. If x = (1 + i), then the product over k=0 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 - 1. So, yeah, substituting x = (1 + i), it becomes ((1 + i))^13 - 1.\n\nSimilarly, the other product would be ((1 - i))^13 - 1. So putting it all together, the original product is [((1 + i)^13 - 1)] * [((1 - i)^13 - 1)].\n\nSo now I need to compute ((1 + i)^13 - 1) * ((1 - i)^13 - 1). Hmm, that's manageable.\n\nFirst, let me compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nI remember that (1 + i) has a magnitude of sqrt(2) and an angle of 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, in polar form, (1 + i) = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, when we raise these to the 13th power:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^{13} first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^{6} * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the exponents: 13 * \u03c0/4. Let me compute that modulo 2\u03c0 to simplify.\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0. But 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 (mod 2\u03c0), since 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0. So 13\u03c0/4 \u2261 \u03c0/4 + \u03c0 = 5\u03c0/4, which is in the third quadrant.\n\nSimilarly, -13\u03c0/4 is the same as -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0 + 16\u03c0)/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So, e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4} = e^{i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i13\u03c0/4} = e^{i3\u03c0/4} = cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.",

So, product (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 product (a - \u03c9^k) = - product (a - \u03c9^k).\n\nBut product (a - \u03c9^k) from k=0 to 12 is a^13 - 1. Because that's the same as evaluating the polynomial x^13 -1 at x = a. So, product (a - \u03c9^k) = a^13 - 1. Therefore, product (\u03c9^k - a) = - (a^13 - 1).\n\nSo, in our case, the first product is product (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = -( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ), and the second product is product (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = -( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ).\n\nTherefore, the entire product is [ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ] which simplifies to [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nSo, now I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nI know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nWhat's [sqrt(2)]^13? Let's compute that. sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so [2^(1/2)]^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, what about the exponentials?\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 because 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, we can subtract multiples of 2\u03c0 to get an equivalent angle.\n\nSo, 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Let me compute 13\u03c0/4 modulo 2\u03c0. 13 divided by 4 is 3.25, so 3 full circles (6\u03c0) plus 0.25*2\u03c0 = 0.5\u03c0.",

So, starting from the product, I converted each term into (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)), then recognized the product over k is the product of (x - \u03c9^k) evaluated at x = 1 + i and x =1 - i, then used the fact that product (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 -1. Then, I accounted for the negative sign because it was (\u03c9^k - x) instead of (x - \u03c9^k), leading to a negative. Then, I computed (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 by converting to polar form, raised to the 13th power, then converted back. Then, subtracted 1, multiplied the two, and ended up with 8321. Then, mod 1000 gives 321.\n\nHmm, seems correct, but let me verify each step.\n\nFirst, the substitution z = \u03c9^k, so the term becomes 2 - 2z + z\u00b2, which factors into (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)). So, correct.\n\nThen, the product over k of (\u03c9^k - a) is equal to (-1)^13 times product (a - \u03c9^k) which is - (a^13 - 1). So, that's correct because product (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 -1.\n\nSo, each product is -(a^13 -1). So, the entire product is [ - ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ] which is equal to ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ). Correct.\n\nThen, computing (1 + i)^13. Since 1 + i is sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}, raising to 13 gives (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i13\u03c0/4}. (sqrt(2))^13 is 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64*sqrt(2). Correct.\n\nThen, 13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is \u03c0/4 more than 3\u03c0, but since e^{i\u03b8} is 2\u03c0 periodic, 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 5\u03c0/4 because 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2. Correct.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * ( -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64*(-1) - 64i. So, -64 -64i.",

So, if we set x = a, then the product from k=0 to 12 of (a - \u03c9^k) = a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1. That's a key insight.\n\nSo, in this case, for the first product, we have Product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = [(1 + i)^13 - 1]. Similarly, Product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = [(1 - i)^13 - 1].

Let's compute 13 * \u03c0/4 modulo 2\u03c0.\n\n13 divided by 8 is 1 with a remainder of 5, so 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + 2\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. So, 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0*1 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, angle is 5\u03c0/4, which is in the third quadrant.\n\nSimilarly, (1 -i)^13 has angle -13\u03c0/4. Let's compute that modulo 2\u03c0.\n\n-13\u03c0/4 is the same as 2\u03c0 - 13\u03c0/4 = 8\u03c0/4 -13\u03c0/4 = -5\u03c0/4.",
          "text2": "Wait, more precisely, the polynomial x^{13} - 1 factors as the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12. So, if I set x = (1 + i), then the product from k=0 to 12 of (1 + i - \u03c9^k) is equal to (1 + i)^{13} - 1. Similarly, for x = (1 - i), the product from k=0 to 12 of (1 - i - \u03c9^k) is equal to (1 - i)^{13} - 1.\n\nBut in our case, each product is \u220f (\u03c9^k - c), where c is a constant. So that's the same as \u220f (c - \u03c9^k) multiplied by (-1)^{13}, because each term is (\u03c9^k - c) = - (c - \u03c9^k). So, since there are 13 terms, it's (-1)^{13} times the product of (c - \u03c9^k).\n\nTherefore, \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - c) = (-1)^{13} * \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k) = - \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k).\n\nBut \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k) = c^{13} - 1, because that's the factorization of x^{13} - 1. So, substituting c = 1 + i, we get \u220f (1 + i - \u03c9^k) = (1 + i)^{13} - 1.\n\nThus, \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = - [(1 + i)^{13} - 1]. Similarly, \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = - [(1 - i)^{13} - 1].\n\nTherefore, the entire product P is equal to:\n\nP = [ - ( (1 + i)^{13} - 1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^{13} - 1 ) ].\n\nSimplify this expression. Let's compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^{13} and (1 - i)^{13}.\n\nWe know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, (1 + i) = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^{13} = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}, so (1 - i)^{13} = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^{13} first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the exponentials:\n\nFor (1 + i)^{13}, exponent is 13 * \u03c0/4. Let's compute 13 * \u03c0/4. 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 in terms of the unit circle because adding 2\u03c0 brings it back, but 3\u03c0 is \u03c0 + 2\u03c0.",

Similarly, for x = (1 - i), the product from k=0 to 12 of (1 - i - \u03c9^k) is equal to (1 - i)^{13} - 1.\n\nBut in our case, each product is \u220f (\u03c9^k - c), where c is a constant. So that's the same as \u220f (c - \u03c9^k) multiplied by (-1)^{13}, because each term is (\u03c9^k - c) = - (c - \u03c9^k). So, since there are 13 terms, it's (-1)^{13} times the product of (c - \u03c9^k).\n\nTherefore, \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - c) = (-1)^{13} * \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k) = - \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k).\n\nBut \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k) = c^{13} - 1, because that's the factorization of x^{13} - 1. So, substituting c = 1 + i, we get \u220f (1 + i - \u03c9^k) = (1 + i)^{13} - 1.\n\nThus, \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = - [(1 + i)^{13} - 1].

Let's compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^{13} and (1 - i)^{13}.\n\nWe know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, (1 + i) = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^{13} = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}, so (1 - i)^{13} = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^{13} first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the exponentials:\n\nFor (1 + i)^{13}, exponent is 13 * \u03c0/4.

So cos(5\u03c0/4)=-sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4)=-sqrt(2)/2. So, 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64*(-1 - i). Which is -64 -64i.

But as I said, the product over all \u03c9^k of (x - \u03c9^k) is x^13 - 1. So product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 - 1. But our product is product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - x) = (-1)^13 * product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = - (x^13 - 1), because (-1)^13 is -1.\n\nSo, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - x) = - (x^13 - 1).

Then subtract 1, multiply by (-1), and then multiply both together.\n\nI know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. Let's compute the modulus and argument of 1 + i. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) as well, and argument -\u03c0/4. So, 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * (-\u03c0/4)}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13. Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2). So, (sqrt(2))^13 = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents:\n\nFor 13 * \u03c0/4: 13 divided by 4 is 3.25, which is 3 + 1/4. So, 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, so 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0. So, e^{i * (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i * (\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, for 13 * (-\u03c0/4): 13 * (-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4. Let's add multiples of 2\u03c0 until it's within 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\n-13\u03c0/4 = -(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4. Adding 4\u03c0 (which is 8\u03c0/2 or 2*(2\u03c0)), wait, perhaps it's easier to add 2\u03c0 until it's positive.\n\n-13\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = -13\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4 = (-5\u03c0)/4. Still negative. Add another 2\u03c0: (-5\u03c0/4) + 8\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4.

But as I said, the product over all \u03c9^k of (x - \u03c9^k) is x^13 - 1. So product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 - 1. But our product is product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - x) = (-1)^13 * product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = - (x^13 - 1), because (-1)^13 is -1.\n\nSo, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - x) = - (x^13 - 1). So substituting x = 1 + i, it becomes -( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ). Similarly, for the other product with x = 1 - i, it becomes -( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ).\n\nTherefore, the original product is [ -( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ -( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.

The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) as well, and argument -\u03c0/4. So, 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * (-\u03c0/4)}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13. Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).

But since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, so 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0. So, e^{i * (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i * (\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, for 13 * (-\u03c0/4): 13 * (-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4. Let's add multiples of 2\u03c0 until it's within 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\n-13\u03c0/4 = -(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4. Adding 4\u03c0 (which is 8\u03c0/2 or 2*(2\u03c0)), wait, perhaps it's easier to add 2\u03c0 until it's positive.\n\n-13\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = -13\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4 = (-5\u03c0)/4. Still negative. Add another 2\u03c0: (-5\u03c0/4) + 8\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So e^{i * (-13\u03c0/4)} = e^{i * 3\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i5\u03c0/4} and (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i3\u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, e^{i5\u03c0/4} is equal to cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2).

The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nWhat's [sqrt(2)]^13? Let's compute that. sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so [2^(1/2)]^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, what about the exponentials?\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 because 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, we can subtract multiples of 2\u03c0 to get an equivalent angle.\n\nSo, 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Let me compute 13\u03c0/4 modulo 2\u03c0. 13 divided by 4 is 3.25, so 3 full circles (6\u03c0) plus 0.25*2\u03c0 = 0.5\u03c0.",
          "text2": "Wait, so let's consider the first product: product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)). Let me set x = 1 + i. Then the product is product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - x). But as I said, the product over all \u03c9^k of (x - \u03c9^k) is x^13 - 1. So product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 - 1. But our product is product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - x) = (-1)^13 * product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = - (x^13 - 1), because (-1)^13 is -1.\n\nSo, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - x) = - (x^13 - 1). So substituting x = 1 + i, it becomes -( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ). Similarly, for the other product with x = 1 - i, it becomes -( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ).\n\nTherefore, the original product is [ -( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ -( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13. Then subtract 1, multiply by (-1), and then multiply both together.\n\nI know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. Let's compute the modulus and argument of 1 + i. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) as well, and argument -\u03c0/4. So, 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * (-\u03c0/4)}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13. Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2). So, (sqrt(2))^13 = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents:\n\nFor 13 * \u03c0/4: 13 divided by 4 is 3.25, which is 3 + 1/4. So, 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, so 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0. So, e^{i * (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i * (\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, for 13 * (-\u03c0/4): 13 * (-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4. Let's add multiples of 2\u03c0 until it's within 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\n-13\u03c0/4 = -(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4. Adding 4\u03c0 (which is 8\u03c0/2 or 2*(2\u03c0)), wait, perhaps it's easier to add 2\u03c0 until it's positive.\n\n-13\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = -13\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4 = (-5\u03c0)/4. Still negative. Add another 2\u03c0: (-5\u03c0/4) + 8\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So e^{i * (-13\u03c0/4)} = e^{i * 3\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i5\u03c0/4} and (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i3\u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, e^{i5\u03c0/4} is equal to cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2). Similarly, e^{i3\u03c0/4} is cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2).\n\nSo, let's compute each term:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2) = 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2)(1 + i).\n\nSimplify that: 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2) = 64 * (- (2)/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, (1 + i)^13 = -64*(1 + i).",

Hmm, that's manageable.\n\nFirst, let me compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nI remember that (1 + i) has a magnitude of sqrt(2) and an angle of 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, in polar form, (1 + i) = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, when we raise these to the 13th power:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^{13} first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^{6} * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the exponents: 13 * \u03c0/4. Let me compute that modulo 2\u03c0 to simplify.\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0. But 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 (mod 2\u03c0), since 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0. So 13\u03c0/4 \u2261 \u03c0/4 + \u03c0 = 5\u03c0/4, which is in the third quadrant.\n\nSimilarly, -13\u03c0/4 is the same as -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0 + 16\u03c0)/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So, e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4} = e^{i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i13\u03c0/4} = e^{i3\u03c0/4} = cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.",
          "text2": "Wait a second, no, because the product is (x - \u03c9^k), so if I plug in x = a, it's product (a - \u03c9^k) = a^13 - 1. Similarly for x = b, it's b^13 - 1.\n\nSo, the entire product becomes (a^13 - 1)(b^13 - 1), where a = 1 + i and b = 1 - i.\n\nSo, let me compute a^13 and b^13 first.\n\nBut calculating (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 might be a bit tedious, but perhaps manageable. Let's see.\n\nFirst, let me note that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus of (1 + i) is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4, since it's in the first quadrant, 45 degrees.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) as well, and the argument is -\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (1 + i) can be written as sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}, and (1 - i) is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute [sqrt(2)]^13. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so [2^{1/2}]^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2). So, that's the modulus part.\n\nNow, the exponentials: e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute 13 * \u03c0/4. That's (12 + 1) * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Since angles are periodic modulo 2\u03c0, 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 (since 3\u03c0 = \u03c0 + 2\u03c0). So, 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i*5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i *13 \u03c0/4} is the same as e^{-i *5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ]\n\nSimilarly,\n\n(1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ]\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst, (1 + i)^13:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ]\n\nLet me compute the multiplication inside:\n\nsqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = (-2)/2 = -1\n\nsqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = (-i * 2)/2 = -i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * ( -1 - i ) = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ]\n\nCompute inside:\n\nsqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -1\n\nsqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2) = i * 2 / 2 = i\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * ( -1 + i ) = -64 + 64i.\n\nSo, now, (a^13 - 1) = ( -64 -64i -1 ) = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (b^13 -1) = (-64 +64i -1 ) = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, the product is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i). That's a product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is the square of the modulus.\n\nSo, the modulus squared is (-65)^2 + (64)^2.",

So, substituting x = a, we get \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) = (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(a - 1) = product_{k=1}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k). Therefore, product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^12 product_{k=1}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = product_{k=1}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a).\n\nBecause (-1)^12 is 1, so product (\u03c9^k - a) = product (a - \u03c9^k). Therefore, product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) = (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(a - 1).\n\nSo, going back to our problem, the product we're trying to compute is:\n\nproduct_{k=1}^{12} [(\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i))] = [product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)))] = \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).\n\nTherefore, the entire product is equal to \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).\n\nNow, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(x - 1). So, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = ((1 + i)^13 - 1)/( (1 + i) - 1 ) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / (i).\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) = ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / (-i).\n\nSo, let's compute these two terms separately.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nWe know that 1 + i can be represented in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2), and argument -\u03c0/4, so 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i*13\u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13:\n\nsqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let me compute e^{i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSince 13\u03c0/4 is more than 2\u03c0, let's subtract multiples of 2\u03c0 to find an equivalent angle.\n\n13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4.\n\nBut 3\u03c0 is equal to \u03c0 + 2\u03c0, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 is \u03c0/4 plus an odd multiple of \u03c0. But when considering this on the unit circle, e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0. So, 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0*(1) = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Similarly, 5\u03c0/4 is in the third quadrant, which is \u03c0 + \u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{i*(5\u03c0/4)} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i*13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i*(5\u03c0/4)} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nLet me compute each of these:\n\nFirst, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nMultiplying sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = (-2)/2 = -1.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = (-i * 2)/2 = -i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * [ -1 - i ].\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nAgain, sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = -1, and sqrt(2)*(i sqrt(2)/2) = i.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = 64* [ -1 + i ].\n\nSo now, let's compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).\n\n\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) = [ (-64 - 64i) - 1 ] / (i) = [ -65 - 64i ] / i.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) = [ (-64 + 64i) - 1 ] / (-i) = [ -65 + 64i ] / (-i).",

So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i is sqrt(2) e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}: Let's compute the angle.\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0. So, it's equivalent to \u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is 5\u03c0/4.",

So, yeah, substituting x = (1 + i), it becomes ((1 + i))^13 - 1.\n\nSimilarly, the other product would be ((1 - i))^13 - 1. So putting it all together, the original product is [((1 + i)^13 - 1)] * [((1 - i)^13 - 1)].\n\nSo now I need to compute ((1 + i)^13 - 1) * ((1 - i)^13 - 1). Hmm, that's manageable.\n\nFirst, let me compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nI remember that (1 + i) has a magnitude of sqrt(2) and an angle of 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, in polar form, (1 + i) = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, when we raise these to the 13th power:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^{13} first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^{6} * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the exponents: 13 * \u03c0/4. Let me compute that modulo 2\u03c0 to simplify.\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0. But 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 (mod 2\u03c0), since 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0. So 13\u03c0/4 \u2261 \u03c0/4 + \u03c0 = 5\u03c0/4, which is in the third quadrant.\n\nSimilarly, -13\u03c0/4 is the same as -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0 + 16\u03c0)/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So, e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4} = e^{i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i13\u03c0/4} = e^{i3\u03c0/4} = cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.",

Therefore, product (\u03c9^k - a) = - (a^13 - 1).\n\nSo, in our case, the first product is product (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = -( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ), and the second product is product (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = -( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ).\n\nTherefore, the entire product is [ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ] which simplifies to [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nSo, now I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nI know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nWhat's [sqrt(2)]^13? Let's compute that. sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so [2^(1/2)]^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, what about the exponentials?\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 because 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, we can subtract multiples of 2\u03c0 to get an equivalent angle.\n\nSo, 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Let me compute 13\u03c0/4 modulo 2\u03c0. 13 divided by 4 is 3.25, so 3 full circles (6\u03c0) plus 0.25*2\u03c0 = 0.5\u03c0.",

So, starting from the product, I converted each term into (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)), then recognized the product over k is the product of (x - \u03c9^k) evaluated at x = 1 + i and x =1 - i, then used the fact that product (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 -1. Then, I accounted for the negative sign because it was (\u03c9^k - x) instead of (x - \u03c9^k), leading to a negative. Then, I computed (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 by converting to polar form, raised to the 13th power, then converted back. Then, subtracted 1, multiplied the two, and ended up with 8321. Then, mod 1000 gives 321.\n\nHmm, seems correct, but let me verify each step.\n\nFirst, the substitution z = \u03c9^k, so the term becomes 2 - 2z + z\u00b2, which factors into (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)). So, correct.\n\nThen, the product over k of (\u03c9^k - a) is equal to (-1)^13 times product (a - \u03c9^k) which is - (a^13 - 1). So, that's correct because product (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 -1.\n\nSo, each product is -(a^13 -1). So, the entire product is [ - ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ] which is equal to ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ). Correct.\n\nThen, computing (1 + i)^13. Since 1 + i is sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}, raising to 13 gives (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i13\u03c0/4}. (sqrt(2))^13 is 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64*sqrt(2). Correct.\n\nThen, 13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is \u03c0/4 more than 3\u03c0, but since e^{i\u03b8} is 2\u03c0 periodic, 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 5\u03c0/4 because 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2. Correct.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * ( -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64*(-1) - 64i. So, -64 -64i.",

So, if we set x = a, then the product from k=0 to 12 of (a - \u03c9^k) = a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1. That's a key insight.\n\nSo, in this case, for the first product, we have Product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = [(1 + i)^13 - 1]. Similarly, Product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = [(1 - i)^13 - 1]. So, the entire product we're looking for is [(1 + i)^13 - 1] * [(1 - i)^13 - 1].\n\nSo, now my task reduces to computing this expression and then taking the result modulo 1000.\n\nLet me compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 first.\n\nI know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. Let me calculate its magnitude and angle. The magnitude is sqrt(1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2) = sqrt(2). The angle is 45 degrees, or \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has the same magnitude, sqrt(2), but the angle is -\u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13 first. sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).

The magnitude of 1+i is sqrt(2), and its angle is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSimilarly, 1-i has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle -\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}\n\nSimilarly, (1 -i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}\n\nLet me compute [sqrt(2)]^13.

Similarly, for x = (1 - i), the product from k=0 to 12 of (1 - i - \u03c9^k) is equal to (1 - i)^{13} - 1.\n\nBut in our case, each product is \u220f (\u03c9^k - c), where c is a constant. So that's the same as \u220f (c - \u03c9^k) multiplied by (-1)^{13}, because each term is (\u03c9^k - c) = - (c - \u03c9^k). So, since there are 13 terms, it's (-1)^{13} times the product of (c - \u03c9^k).\n\nTherefore, \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - c) = (-1)^{13} * \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k) = - \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k).\n\nBut \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k) = c^{13} - 1, because that's the factorization of x^{13} - 1.

Similarly, for x = (1 - i), the product from k=0 to 12 of (1 - i - \u03c9^k) is equal to (1 - i)^{13} - 1.\n\nBut in our case, each product is \u220f (\u03c9^k - c), where c is a constant.

So, since there are 13 terms, it's (-1)^{13} times the product of (c - \u03c9^k).\n\nTherefore, \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - c) = (-1)^{13} * \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k) = - \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k).\n\nBut \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k) = c^{13} - 1, because that's the factorization of x^{13} - 1.

As before, 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is the same as \u03c0/4 beyond 2\u03c0 (since 3\u03c0 is \u03c0 plus 2\u03c0). But in terms of position, 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.

Angle: 13*(\u03c0/4) = 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is \u03c0/4 more than 3\u03c0, which is equivalent to \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4, as I had earlier. So cos(5\u03c0/4)=-sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4)=-sqrt(2)/2. So, 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64*(-1 - i). Which is -64 -64i.

But as I said, the product over all \u03c9^k of (x - \u03c9^k) is x^13 - 1. So product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 - 1. But our product is product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - x) = (-1)^13 * product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = - (x^13 - 1), because (-1)^13 is -1.\n\nSo, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - x) = - (x^13 - 1). So substituting x = 1 + i, it becomes -( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ). Similarly, for the other product with x = 1 - i, it becomes -( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ).\n\nTherefore, the original product is [ -( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ -( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13. Then subtract 1, multiply by (-1), and then multiply both together.\n\nI know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. Let's compute the modulus and argument of 1 + i. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) as well, and argument -\u03c0/4. So, 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * (-\u03c0/4)}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13. Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2). So, (sqrt(2))^13 = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents:\n\nFor 13 * \u03c0/4: 13 divided by 4 is 3.25, which is 3 + 1/4. So, 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, so 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0. So, e^{i * (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i * (\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, for 13 * (-\u03c0/4): 13 * (-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4. Let's add multiples of 2\u03c0 until it's within 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\n-13\u03c0/4 = -(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4. Adding 4\u03c0 (which is 8\u03c0/2 or 2*(2\u03c0)), wait, perhaps it's easier to add 2\u03c0 until it's positive.\n\n-13\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = -13\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4 = (-5\u03c0)/4. Still negative. Add another 2\u03c0: (-5\u03c0/4) + 8\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4.

But as I said, the product over all \u03c9^k of (x - \u03c9^k) is x^13 - 1. So product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 - 1. But our product is product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - x) = (-1)^13 * product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = - (x^13 - 1), because (-1)^13 is -1.\n\nSo, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - x) = - (x^13 - 1). So substituting x = 1 + i, it becomes -( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ). Similarly, for the other product with x = 1 - i, it becomes -( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ).\n\nTherefore, the original product is [ -( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ -( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.

The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) as well, and argument -\u03c0/4. So, 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * (-\u03c0/4)}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13. Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).

But since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, so 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0. So, e^{i * (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i * (\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, for 13 * (-\u03c0/4): 13 * (-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4. Let's add multiples of 2\u03c0 until it's within 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\n-13\u03c0/4 = -(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4. Adding 4\u03c0 (which is 8\u03c0/2 or 2*(2\u03c0)), wait, perhaps it's easier to add 2\u03c0 until it's positive.\n\n-13\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = -13\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4 = (-5\u03c0)/4. Still negative. Add another 2\u03c0: (-5\u03c0/4) + 8\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So e^{i * (-13\u03c0/4)} = e^{i * 3\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i5\u03c0/4} and (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i3\u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, e^{i5\u03c0/4} is equal to cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2).

          "text1": "Wait, but hold on. Let me think again. The product from k=0 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k) is indeed x^13 - 1, but we have the product of (\u03c9^k - a). So, that's the same as (-1)^13 times the product of (a - \u03c9^k), which is - (product of (a - \u03c9^k)) because 13 is odd. So, product (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 product (a - \u03c9^k) = - product (a - \u03c9^k).\n\nBut product (a - \u03c9^k) from k=0 to 12 is a^13 - 1. Because that's the same as evaluating the polynomial x^13 -1 at x = a. So, product (a - \u03c9^k) = a^13 - 1. Therefore, product (\u03c9^k - a) = - (a^13 - 1).\n\nSo, in our case, the first product is product (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = -( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ), and the second product is product (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = -( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ).\n\nTherefore, the entire product is [ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ] which simplifies to [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nSo, now I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nI know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nWhat's [sqrt(2)]^13? Let's compute that. sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so [2^(1/2)]^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, what about the exponentials?\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 because 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, we can subtract multiples of 2\u03c0 to get an equivalent angle.\n\nSo, 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Let me compute 13\u03c0/4 modulo 2\u03c0. 13 divided by 4 is 3.25, so 3 full circles (6\u03c0) plus 0.25*2\u03c0 = 0.5\u03c0.",
          "text2": "Wait, so let's consider the first product: product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)). Let me set x = 1 + i. Then the product is product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - x). But as I said, the product over all \u03c9^k of (x - \u03c9^k) is x^13 - 1. So product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 - 1. But our product is product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - x) = (-1)^13 * product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = - (x^13 - 1), because (-1)^13 is -1.\n\nSo, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - x) = - (x^13 - 1). So substituting x = 1 + i, it becomes -( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ). Similarly, for the other product with x = 1 - i, it becomes -( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ).\n\nTherefore, the original product is [ -( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ -( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13. Then subtract 1, multiply by (-1), and then multiply both together.\n\nI know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. Let's compute the modulus and argument of 1 + i. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) as well, and argument -\u03c0/4. So, 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * (-\u03c0/4)}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13. Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2). So, (sqrt(2))^13 = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents:\n\nFor 13 * \u03c0/4: 13 divided by 4 is 3.25, which is 3 + 1/4. So, 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, so 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0. So, e^{i * (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i * (\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, for 13 * (-\u03c0/4): 13 * (-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4. Let's add multiples of 2\u03c0 until it's within 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\n-13\u03c0/4 = -(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4. Adding 4\u03c0 (which is 8\u03c0/2 or 2*(2\u03c0)), wait, perhaps it's easier to add 2\u03c0 until it's positive.\n\n-13\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = -13\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4 = (-5\u03c0)/4. Still negative. Add another 2\u03c0: (-5\u03c0/4) + 8\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So e^{i * (-13\u03c0/4)} = e^{i * 3\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i5\u03c0/4} and (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i3\u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, e^{i5\u03c0/4} is equal to cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2). Similarly, e^{i3\u03c0/4} is cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2).\n\nSo, let's compute each term:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2) = 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2)(1 + i).\n\nSimplify that: 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2) = 64 * (- (2)/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, (1 + i)^13 = -64*(1 + i).",

So, yeah, substituting x = (1 + i), it becomes ((1 + i))^13 - 1.\n\nSimilarly, the other product would be ((1 - i))^13 - 1. So putting it all together, the original product is [((1 + i)^13 - 1)] * [((1 - i)^13 - 1)].\n\nSo now I need to compute ((1 + i)^13 - 1) * ((1 - i)^13 - 1). Hmm, that's manageable.\n\nFirst, let me compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nI remember that (1 + i) has a magnitude of sqrt(2) and an angle of 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, in polar form, (1 + i) = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, when we raise these to the 13th power:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^{13} first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^{6} * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the exponents: 13 * \u03c0/4. Let me compute that modulo 2\u03c0 to simplify.\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0. But 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 (mod 2\u03c0), since 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0. So 13\u03c0/4 \u2261 \u03c0/4 + \u03c0 = 5\u03c0/4, which is in the third quadrant.\n\nSimilarly, -13\u03c0/4 is the same as -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0 + 16\u03c0)/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So, e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4} = e^{i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i13\u03c0/4} = e^{i3\u03c0/4} = cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.",

Let's see.\n\nFirst, let me note that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus of (1 + i) is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4, since it's in the first quadrant, 45 degrees.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) as well, and the argument is -\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (1 + i) can be written as sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}, and (1 - i) is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute [sqrt(2)]^13. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so [2^{1/2}]^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2). So, that's the modulus part.\n\nNow, the exponentials: e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute 13 * \u03c0/4. That's (12 + 1) * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Since angles are periodic modulo 2\u03c0, 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 (since 3\u03c0 = \u03c0 + 2\u03c0). So, 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i*5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i *13 \u03c0/4} is the same as e^{-i *5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ]\n\nSimilarly,\n\n(1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ]\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst, (1 + i)^13:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ]\n\nLet me compute the multiplication inside:\n\nsqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = (-2)/2 = -1\n\nsqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = (-i * 2)/2 = -i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * ( -1 - i ) = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ]\n\nCompute inside:\n\nsqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -1\n\nsqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2) = i * 2 / 2 = i\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * ( -1 + i ) = -64 + 64i.\n\nSo, now, (a^13 - 1) = ( -64 -64i -1 ) = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (b^13 -1) = (-64 +64i -1 ) = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, the product is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i). That's a product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is the square of the modulus.\n\nSo, the modulus squared is (-65)^2 + (64)^2.",

So, substituting x = a, we get \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) = (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(a - 1) = product_{k=1}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k). Therefore, product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^12 product_{k=1}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = product_{k=1}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a).\n\nBecause (-1)^12 is 1, so product (\u03c9^k - a) = product (a - \u03c9^k). Therefore, product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) = (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(a - 1).\n\nSo, going back to our problem, the product we're trying to compute is:\n\nproduct_{k=1}^{12} [(\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i))] = [product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)))] = \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).\n\nTherefore, the entire product is equal to \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).\n\nNow, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(x - 1). So, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = ((1 + i)^13 - 1)/( (1 + i) - 1 ) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / (i).\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) = ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / (-i).\n\nSo, let's compute these two terms separately.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nWe know that 1 + i can be represented in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2), and argument -\u03c0/4, so 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i*13\u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13:\n\nsqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let me compute e^{i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSince 13\u03c0/4 is more than 2\u03c0, let's subtract multiples of 2\u03c0 to find an equivalent angle.\n\n13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4.\n\nBut 3\u03c0 is equal to \u03c0 + 2\u03c0, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 is \u03c0/4 plus an odd multiple of \u03c0. But when considering this on the unit circle, e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0. So, 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0*(1) = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Similarly, 5\u03c0/4 is in the third quadrant, which is \u03c0 + \u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{i*(5\u03c0/4)} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i*13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i*(5\u03c0/4)} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nLet me compute each of these:\n\nFirst, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nMultiplying sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = (-2)/2 = -1.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = (-i * 2)/2 = -i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * [ -1 - i ].\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nAgain, sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = -1, and sqrt(2)*(i sqrt(2)/2) = i.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = 64* [ -1 + i ].\n\nSo now, let's compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).\n\n\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) = [ (-64 - 64i) - 1 ] / (i) = [ -65 - 64i ] / i.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) = [ (-64 + 64i) - 1 ] / (-i) = [ -65 + 64i ] / (-i).",

So, in polar form, (1 + i) = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, when we raise these to the 13th power:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^{13} first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^{6} * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the exponents: 13 * \u03c0/4. Let me compute that modulo 2\u03c0 to simplify.\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0. But 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 (mod 2\u03c0), since 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0. So 13\u03c0/4 \u2261 \u03c0/4 + \u03c0 = 5\u03c0/4, which is in the third quadrant.\n\nSimilarly, -13\u03c0/4 is the same as -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0 + 16\u03c0)/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So, e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4} = e^{i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i13\u03c0/4} = e^{i3\u03c0/4} = cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.",

So, starting from the product, I converted each term into (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)), then recognized the product over k is the product of (x - \u03c9^k) evaluated at x = 1 + i and x =1 - i, then used the fact that product (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 -1. Then, I accounted for the negative sign because it was (\u03c9^k - x) instead of (x - \u03c9^k), leading to a negative. Then, I computed (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 by converting to polar form, raised to the 13th power, then converted back. Then, subtracted 1, multiplied the two, and ended up with 8321. Then, mod 1000 gives 321.\n\nHmm, seems correct, but let me verify each step.\n\nFirst, the substitution z = \u03c9^k, so the term becomes 2 - 2z + z\u00b2, which factors into (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)). So, correct.\n\nThen, the product over k of (\u03c9^k - a) is equal to (-1)^13 times product (a - \u03c9^k) which is - (a^13 - 1). So, that's correct because product (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 -1.\n\nSo, each product is -(a^13 -1). So, the entire product is [ - ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ] which is equal to ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ). Correct.\n\nThen, computing (1 + i)^13. Since 1 + i is sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}, raising to 13 gives (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i13\u03c0/4}. (sqrt(2))^13 is 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64*sqrt(2). Correct.\n\nThen, 13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is \u03c0/4 more than 3\u03c0, but since e^{i\u03b8} is 2\u03c0 periodic, 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 5\u03c0/4 because 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2. Correct.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * ( -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64*(-1) - 64i. So, -64 -64i.",

So, if we set x = a, then the product from k=0 to 12 of (a - \u03c9^k) = a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1. That's a key insight.\n\nSo, in this case, for the first product, we have Product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = [(1 + i)^13 - 1]. Similarly, Product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = [(1 - i)^13 - 1]. So, the entire product we're looking for is [(1 + i)^13 - 1] * [(1 - i)^13 - 1].\n\nSo, now my task reduces to computing this expression and then taking the result modulo 1000.\n\nLet me compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 first.\n\nI know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. Let me calculate its magnitude and angle. The magnitude is sqrt(1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2) = sqrt(2). The angle is 45 degrees, or \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has the same magnitude, sqrt(2), but the angle is -\u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13 first. sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).

Using quadratic formula: z = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 2i]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i.\n\nSo, a = 1 + i and b = 1 - i.\n\nTherefore, P = (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1).\n\nSo, I need to compute a^13 and b^13. Hmm, that's going to involve complex numbers.\n\nBut perhaps I can write a and b in polar form. Since a = 1 + i, which has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4. Similarly, b = 1 - i has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle -\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, a = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}, and b = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nThen, a^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i13\u03c0/4}, and similarly for b^13.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSimilarly, e^{i13\u03c0/4} can be simplified. Since 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 in terms of angle (since angles are modulo 2\u03c0). So 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4, but also, 13\u03c0/4 is 3*2\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which reduces to \u03c0/4.",

But in terms of position, 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, angle 5\u03c0/4 is in the third quadrant, where both cosine and sine are negative.\n\nSo, cos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nThus, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)] = 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-1 - i) = -64 -64i.\n\nThat's correct. Similarly, (1 - i)^13 will be the conjugate, so -64 +64i.\n\nSo, substituting into the product:\n\n[ (-64 -64i) -1 ] * [ (-64 +64i) -1 ] = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i).\n\nMultiply these two:\n\n(-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096 * (-1)) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the product is 8321, and when divided by 1000, the remainder is 321.",

Raised to 13th power: modulus (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2)=64*sqrt(2). Angle: 13*(\u03c0/4) = 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is \u03c0/4 more than 3\u03c0, which is equivalent to \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4, as I had earlier. So cos(5\u03c0/4)=-sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4)=-sqrt(2)/2. So, 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64*(-1 - i). Which is -64 -64i. Then subtract 1: -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13: sqrt(2) at angle -\u03c0/4. 13*(-\u03c0/4)= -13\u03c0/4. Adding 4\u03c0 (which is 16\u03c0/4) gives us 3\u03c0/4. So, cos(3\u03c0/4)=-sqrt(2)/2, sin(3\u03c0/4)=sqrt(2)/2. So, modulus part is 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64*(-1 + i). Then subtract 1: -65 +64i.\n\nMultiplying (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i)= (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096*(-1))=4225+4096=8321. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.",

But as I said, the product over all \u03c9^k of (x - \u03c9^k) is x^13 - 1. So product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 - 1. But our product is product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - x) = (-1)^13 * product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = - (x^13 - 1), because (-1)^13 is -1.\n\nSo, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - x) = - (x^13 - 1). So substituting x = 1 + i, it becomes -( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ). Similarly, for the other product with x = 1 - i, it becomes -( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ).\n\nTherefore, the original product is [ -( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ -( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13. Then subtract 1, multiply by (-1), and then multiply both together.\n\nI know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. Let's compute the modulus and argument of 1 + i. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) as well, and argument -\u03c0/4. So, 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * (-\u03c0/4)}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13. Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2). So, (sqrt(2))^13 = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents:\n\nFor 13 * \u03c0/4: 13 divided by 4 is 3.25, which is 3 + 1/4. So, 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, so 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0. So, e^{i * (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i * (\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, for 13 * (-\u03c0/4): 13 * (-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4. Let's add multiples of 2\u03c0 until it's within 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\n-13\u03c0/4 = -(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4. Adding 4\u03c0 (which is 8\u03c0/2 or 2*(2\u03c0)), wait, perhaps it's easier to add 2\u03c0 until it's positive.\n\n-13\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = -13\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4 = (-5\u03c0)/4. Still negative. Add another 2\u03c0: (-5\u03c0/4) + 8\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So e^{i * (-13\u03c0/4)} = e^{i * 3\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i5\u03c0/4} and (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i3\u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, e^{i5\u03c0/4} is equal to cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2).

Let's compute 13 * \u03c0/4. 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 in terms of the unit circle because adding 2\u03c0 brings it back, but 3\u03c0 is \u03c0 + 2\u03c0.",

But since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, so 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0.

So, that's the same as (-1)^13 times the product of (a - \u03c9^k), which is - (product of (a - \u03c9^k)) because 13 is odd. So, product (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 product (a - \u03c9^k) = - product (a - \u03c9^k).\n\nBut product (a - \u03c9^k) from k=0 to 12 is a^13 - 1.

The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians.

Let me compute 13\u03c0/4 modulo 2\u03c0. 13 divided by 4 is 3.25, so 3 full circles (6\u03c0) plus 0.25*2\u03c0 = 0.5\u03c0.",

But as I said, the product over all \u03c9^k of (x - \u03c9^k) is x^13 - 1. So product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 - 1. But our product is product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - x) = (-1)^13 * product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = - (x^13 - 1), because (-1)^13 is -1.\n\nSo, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - x) = - (x^13 - 1). So substituting x = 1 + i, it becomes -( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ).

But since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, so 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0. So, e^{i * (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i * (\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, for 13 * (-\u03c0/4): 13 * (-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4. Let's add multiples of 2\u03c0 until it's within 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\n-13\u03c0/4 = -(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4. Adding 4\u03c0 (which is 8\u03c0/2 or 2*(2\u03c0)), wait, perhaps it's easier to add 2\u03c0 until it's positive.\n\n-13\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = -13\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4 = (-5\u03c0)/4. Still negative. Add another 2\u03c0: (-5\u03c0/4) + 8\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So e^{i * (-13\u03c0/4)} = e^{i * 3\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i5\u03c0/4} and (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i3\u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, e^{i5\u03c0/4} is equal to cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2).

Let's see.\n\nFirst, let me note that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus of (1 + i) is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4, since it's in the first quadrant, 45 degrees.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) as well, and the argument is -\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (1 + i) can be written as sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}, and (1 - i) is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute [sqrt(2)]^13. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so [2^{1/2}]^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).

Since angles are periodic modulo 2\u03c0, 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 (since 3\u03c0 = \u03c0 + 2\u03c0). So, 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i*5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i *13 \u03c0/4} is the same as e^{-i *5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ]\n\nSimilarly,\n\n(1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ]\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst, (1 + i)^13:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ]\n\nLet me compute the multiplication inside:\n\nsqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = (-2)/2 = -1\n\nsqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = (-i * 2)/2 = -i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * ( -1 - i ) = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ]\n\nCompute inside:\n\nsqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -1\n\nsqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2) = i * 2 / 2 = i\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * ( -1 + i ) = -64 + 64i.\n\nSo, now, (a^13 - 1) = ( -64 -64i -1 ) = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (b^13 -1) = (-64 +64i -1 ) = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, the product is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i).

But when considering this on the unit circle, e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0. So, 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0*(1) = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Similarly, 5\u03c0/4 is in the third quadrant, which is \u03c0 + \u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{i*(5\u03c0/4)} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i*13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i*(5\u03c0/4)} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nLet me compute each of these:\n\nFirst, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nMultiplying sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = (-2)/2 = -1.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = (-i * 2)/2 = -i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * [ -1 - i ].\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nAgain, sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = -1, and sqrt(2)*(i sqrt(2)/2) = i.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = 64* [ -1 + i ].\n\nSo now, let's compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).\n\n\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) = [ (-64 - 64i) - 1 ] / (i) = [ -65 - 64i ] / i.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) = [ (-64 + 64i) - 1 ] / (-i) = [ -65 + 64i ] / (-i).",

So, e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4} = e^{i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i13\u03c0/4} = e^{i3\u03c0/4} = cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.",

Let me verify that.\n\nSince (1 + i) has modulus sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4. So raising to the 13th power, modulus is (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 sqrt(2). The angle becomes 13*(\u03c0/4) = (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4). Since angles wrap every 2\u03c0, 13*(\u03c0/4) = (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is 5\u03c0/4. So, the angle is 5\u03c0/4, which is 225 degrees, pointing to the third quadrant.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * (cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)) = 64 sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2) = 64 sqrt(2)*(-\u221a2/2) + 64 sqrt(2)*(-i\u221a2/2).\n\nCompute 64 sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2): sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)=2, so 64 * 2 * (-1/2)=64*(-1)= -64. Similarly, the imaginary part is 64 sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2)*i= -64i. So yes, (1+i)^13= -64 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13: 1 -i has modulus sqrt(2), angle -\u03c0/4. So (1 -i)^13 modulus is same as before, 64 sqrt(2). Angle is 13*(-\u03c0/4)= -13\u03c0/4. Let's add 2\u03c0 until it's positive: -13\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0= -13\u03c0/4 +8\u03c0/4= -5\u03c0/4.

So, 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0*1 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, angle is 5\u03c0/4, which is in the third quadrant.\n\nSimilarly, (1 -i)^13 has angle -13\u03c0/4. Let's compute that modulo 2\u03c0.\n\n-13\u03c0/4 is the same as 2\u03c0 - 13\u03c0/4 = 8\u03c0/4 -13\u03c0/4 = -5\u03c0/4.",
          "text2": "Wait, more precisely, the polynomial x^{13} - 1 factors as the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12. So, if I set x = (1 + i), then the product from k=0 to 12 of (1 + i - \u03c9^k) is equal to (1 + i)^{13} - 1. Similarly, for x = (1 - i), the product from k=0 to 12 of (1 - i - \u03c9^k) is equal to (1 - i)^{13} - 1.\n\nBut in our case, each product is \u220f (\u03c9^k - c), where c is a constant. So that's the same as \u220f (c - \u03c9^k) multiplied by (-1)^{13}, because each term is (\u03c9^k - c) = - (c - \u03c9^k). So, since there are 13 terms, it's (-1)^{13} times the product of (c - \u03c9^k).\n\nTherefore, \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - c) = (-1)^{13} * \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k) = - \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k).\n\nBut \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k) = c^{13} - 1, because that's the factorization of x^{13} - 1. So, substituting c = 1 + i, we get \u220f (1 + i - \u03c9^k) = (1 + i)^{13} - 1.\n\nThus, \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = - [(1 + i)^{13} - 1]. Similarly, \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = - [(1 - i)^{13} - 1].\n\nTherefore, the entire product P is equal to:\n\nP = [ - ( (1 + i)^{13} - 1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^{13} - 1 ) ].\n\nSimplify this expression. Let's compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^{13} and (1 - i)^{13}.\n\nWe know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, (1 + i) = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^{13} = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}, so (1 - i)^{13} = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^{13} first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the exponentials:\n\nFor (1 + i)^{13}, exponent is 13 * \u03c0/4. Let's compute 13 * \u03c0/4. 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 in terms of the unit circle because adding 2\u03c0 brings it back, but 3\u03c0 is \u03c0 + 2\u03c0.",

As before, 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is the same as \u03c0/4 beyond 2\u03c0 (since 3\u03c0 is \u03c0 plus 2\u03c0). But in terms of position, 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, angle 5\u03c0/4 is in the third quadrant, where both cosine and sine are negative.\n\nSo, cos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nThus, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)] = 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-1 - i) = -64 -64i.\n\nThat's correct. Similarly, (1 - i)^13 will be the conjugate, so -64 +64i.\n\nSo, substituting into the product:\n\n[ (-64 -64i) -1 ] * [ (-64 +64i) -1 ] = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i).\n\nMultiply these two:\n\n(-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096 * (-1)) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the product is 8321, and when divided by 1000, the remainder is 321.",

Raised to 13th power: modulus (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2)=64*sqrt(2). Angle: 13*(\u03c0/4) = 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is \u03c0/4 more than 3\u03c0, which is equivalent to \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4, as I had earlier. So cos(5\u03c0/4)=-sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4)=-sqrt(2)/2. So, 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64*(-1 - i). Which is -64 -64i. Then subtract 1: -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13: sqrt(2) at angle -\u03c0/4. 13*(-\u03c0/4)= -13\u03c0/4. Adding 4\u03c0 (which is 16\u03c0/4) gives us 3\u03c0/4. So, cos(3\u03c0/4)=-sqrt(2)/2, sin(3\u03c0/4)=sqrt(2)/2. So, modulus part is 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64*(-1 + i). Then subtract 1: -65 +64i.\n\nMultiplying (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i)= (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096*(-1))=4225+4096=8321. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.",

But as I said, the product over all \u03c9^k of (x - \u03c9^k) is x^13 - 1. So product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 - 1. But our product is product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - x) = (-1)^13 * product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = - (x^13 - 1), because (-1)^13 is -1.\n\nSo, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - x) = - (x^13 - 1). So substituting x = 1 + i, it becomes -( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ). Similarly, for the other product with x = 1 - i, it becomes -( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ).\n\nTherefore, the original product is [ -( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ -( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13. Then subtract 1, multiply by (-1), and then multiply both together.\n\nI know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. Let's compute the modulus and argument of 1 + i. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) as well, and argument -\u03c0/4. So, 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * (-\u03c0/4)}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13. Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2). So, (sqrt(2))^13 = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents:\n\nFor 13 * \u03c0/4: 13 divided by 4 is 3.25, which is 3 + 1/4. So, 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, so 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0. So, e^{i * (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i * (\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, for 13 * (-\u03c0/4): 13 * (-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4. Let's add multiples of 2\u03c0 until it's within 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\n-13\u03c0/4 = -(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4. Adding 4\u03c0 (which is 8\u03c0/2 or 2*(2\u03c0)), wait, perhaps it's easier to add 2\u03c0 until it's positive.\n\n-13\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = -13\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4 = (-5\u03c0)/4. Still negative. Add another 2\u03c0: (-5\u03c0/4) + 8\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So e^{i * (-13\u03c0/4)} = e^{i * 3\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i5\u03c0/4} and (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i3\u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, e^{i5\u03c0/4} is equal to cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2).

But as I said, the product over all \u03c9^k of (x - \u03c9^k) is x^13 - 1. So product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 - 1. But our product is product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - x) = (-1)^13 * product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = - (x^13 - 1), because (-1)^13 is -1.\n\nSo, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - x) = - (x^13 - 1).

But since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, so 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0.

Let me verify that.\n\nSince (1 + i) has modulus sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4. So raising to the 13th power, modulus is (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 sqrt(2). The angle becomes 13*(\u03c0/4) = (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4). Since angles wrap every 2\u03c0, 13*(\u03c0/4) = (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is 5\u03c0/4. So, the angle is 5\u03c0/4, which is 225 degrees, pointing to the third quadrant.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * (cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)) = 64 sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2) = 64 sqrt(2)*(-\u221a2/2) + 64 sqrt(2)*(-i\u221a2/2).\n\nCompute 64 sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2): sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)=2, so 64 * 2 * (-1/2)=64*(-1)= -64. Similarly, the imaginary part is 64 sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2)*i= -64i. So yes, (1+i)^13= -64 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13: 1 -i has modulus sqrt(2), angle -\u03c0/4. So (1 -i)^13 modulus is same as before, 64 sqrt(2). Angle is 13*(-\u03c0/4)= -13\u03c0/4. Let's add 2\u03c0 until it's positive: -13\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0= -13\u03c0/4 +8\u03c0/4= -5\u03c0/4. Still negative. Add another 2\u03c0: -5\u03c0/4 +8\u03c0/4=3\u03c0/4. So angle is 3\u03c0/4, which is 135 degrees, pointing to the second quadrant.\n\nSo, (1 -i)^13=64 sqrt(2)*(cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4))=64 sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2 +i sqrt(2)/2)=64 sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) +64 sqrt(2)*(i sqrt(2)/2).\n\nAgain, 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2)=64*(-2/2)= -64. The imaginary part: 64*sqrt(2)*(i sqrt(2)/2)=64 i. So, (1 -i)^13= -64 +64i. That's correct.\n\nThen, the products:\n\nFirst product: -( (1 +i)^13 -1 )= -[ (-64 -64i) -1 ]= -[ -65 -64i ]=65 +64i.\n\nSecond product: -( (1 -i)^13 -1 )= -[ (-64 +64i) -1 ]= -[ -65 +64i ]=65 -64i.\n\nMultiply these: (65 +64i)(65 -64i)=65\u00b2 +64\u00b2=4225 +4096=8321.\n\nYes, that seems right.

Angle: 13*(\u03c0/4) = 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is \u03c0/4 more than 3\u03c0, which is equivalent to \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4, as I had earlier. So cos(5\u03c0/4)=-sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4)=-sqrt(2)/2. So, 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64*(-1 - i). Which is -64 -64i. Then subtract 1: -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13: sqrt(2) at angle -\u03c0/4. 13*(-\u03c0/4)= -13\u03c0/4. Adding 4\u03c0 (which is 16\u03c0/4) gives us 3\u03c0/4. So, cos(3\u03c0/4)=-sqrt(2)/2, sin(3\u03c0/4)=sqrt(2)/2. So, modulus part is 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64*(-1 + i). Then subtract 1: -65 +64i.\n\nMultiplying (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i)= (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096*(-1))=4225+4096=8321. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.",

          "text1": "Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, when I computed (1 + i)^13:\n\nI had [sqrt(2)]^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64*sqrt(2). That's correct.\n\nThen, e^{i*5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2. So, multiplying 64*sqrt(2) by this gives:\n\n64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-2/2) = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) i = 64*(-1)i = -64i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 would be the conjugate, which is -64 +64i. Correct.\n\nThen, (1 + i)^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nNow, their product is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i). Let's compute this:\n\nFirst, expand using FOIL:\n\n= (-65)*(-65) + (-65)*(64i) + (-64i)*(-65) + (-64i)*(64i)\n\n= 4225 - 4160i + 4160i - 4096i\u00b2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe -4160i and +4160i cancel out.\n\nSo, 4225 - (4096)(i\u00b2).\n\nSince i\u00b2 = -1, this becomes 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, P = 8321.\n\nNow, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000 = 8000, remainder 321.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321.",
          "text2": "alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that (1 - i)^13 is the conjugate of (1 + i)^13 because (1 - i) is the complex conjugate of (1 + i). So, (1 - i)^13 is the conjugate of (1 + i)^13.\n\nSo, if (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2)*e^{i5\u03c0/4}, then (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2)*e^{-i5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, now, let's compute each term:\n\nFirst, compute 1 - (1 + i)^13.\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)).\n\ncos(5\u03c0/4) = -\u221a2/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -\u221a2/2.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64\u221a2*( -\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2 ) = 64\u221a2*( -\u221a2/2 (1 + i) )\n\nSimplify: \u221a2 * \u221a2 = 2, so:\n\n64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2) = 64 * (-2/2) = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part:\n\n64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2)i = -64i.",
