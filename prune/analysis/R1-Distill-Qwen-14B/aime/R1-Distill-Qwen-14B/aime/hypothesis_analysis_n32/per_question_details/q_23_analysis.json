The diagonals are AC and BD, which intersect at the origin. Since AC is from (a, b) to (-a, -b), its midpoint is the origin, as expected. Similarly, BD is from (c, d) to (-c, -d). \n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes should be -1. Let's compute the slopes. The slope of AC is (b - (-b))/(a - (-a)) = (2b)/(2a) = b/a. Similarly, the slope of BD is (d - (-d))/(c - (-c)) = (2d)/(2c) = d/c. Since they are perpendicular, (b/a) * (d/c) = -1. So, (b d)/(a c) = -1. Therefore, b d = -a c.\n\nAdditionally, all four points lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.

BD is the diagonal from B to D, which has length sqrt[(c - (-c))\u00b2 + (d - (-d))\u00b2] = sqrt[(2c)\u00b2 + (2d)\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).

So, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 4*(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2), over all possible rhombi ABCD as described.\n\nSo, our problem reduces to minimizing c\u00b2 + d\u00b2, given that c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1 and b d = -a c, with a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1.",

So,\n\n(y1/x1) * (y2/x2) = -1.\n\nWhich implies y1 y2 = -x1 x2.\n\nThat's an important relation.\n\nNow, since all four points lie on the hyperbola, their coordinates satisfy x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo,\n\nFor point A: x1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nFor point B: x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSimilarly for points C and D, but since they are just the negatives, the equations will be the same.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. x1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\n2. x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nAnd the relation from the slopes: y1 y2 = -x1 x2.\n\nI need to find BD\u00b2. BD is the length of the diagonal BD, so BD\u00b2 would be the square of the distance between points B and D.",

So, the greatest number that is always less than BD\u00b2, no matter how the rhombus is arranged. So, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think step by step.\n\nI need to express BD\u00b2 in terms of the hyperbola parameters. So, BD\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2). But from the hyperbola equation, for point B, x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 = 1. Let me solve for y2\u00b2: y2\u00b2 = (x2\u00b2/20 -1)*24.\n\nSo, y2\u00b2 = (24/20)x2\u00b2 -24 = (6/5)x2\u00b2 -24.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4[ x2\u00b2 + (6/5 x2\u00b2 -24) ] = 4[ (1 + 6/5)x2\u00b2 -24 ] = 4[ (11/5)x2\u00b2 -24 ] = (44/5)x2\u00b2 -96.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = (44/5)x2\u00b2 -96.\n\nNow, I need to find the possible values of BD\u00b2. So, x2\u00b2 is determined by the hyperbola equation. From the hyperbola equation for point B: x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 =1, so x2\u00b2 must be \u2265 20 because on the hyperbola x\u00b2 \u2265 a\u00b2, where a\u00b2=20.\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 \u2265 20, which implies that BD\u00b2 = (44/5)x2\u00b2 -96 \u2265 (44/5)(20) -96 = 176 -96 =80.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is at least 80.\n\nBut can BD\u00b2 be larger? Well, as x2\u00b2 increases, BD\u00b2 increases because the coefficient is positive. So, BD\u00b2 can be made as large as possible by choosing points B further out on the hyperbola. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 80, and it can go to infinity.",
          "text2": "Wait, but the problem is phrased a bit differently. Let me read it again: \"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's like, we're looking for a number M such that M < BD\u00b2 for every possible rhombus, and M is the greatest such number. So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, because M needs to be less than all BD\u00b2, so the largest such M is the infimum.\n\nSo, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible such rhombi.\n\nSo, BD is the diagonal from B to D, which are points (x2, y2) and (-x2, -y2). So, BD is the distance between (x2,y2) and (-x2,-y2). The distance squared is (x2 - (-x2))\u00b2 + (y2 - (-y2))\u00b2 = (2x2)^2 + (2y2)^2 = 4x2\u00b2 + 4y2\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2). So, we need to find the infimum of 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2), given that (x2,y2) lies on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, and also satisfies the condition x1x2 + y1y2 = 0, with (x1,y1) also lying on the hyperbola.",

So, this condition is necessary for the rhombus.\n\nSo, that's consistent. So, the condition xp + yq = 0 is necessary.\n\nAdditionally, all four points lie on the hyperbola, so we have:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nSo, we have four equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n2. p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\n3. xp + yq = 0\n4.

But actually, since diagonals are AC and BD, they are vectors from A to C and from B to D. So, vectors AC and BD are (-2a, -2b) and (-2c, -2d), respectively.\n\nTheir dot product should be zero because the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nSo, (-2a)(-2c) + (-2b)(-2d) = 0.\n\nWhich simplifies to 4ac + 4bd = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by 4: ac + bd = 0.\n\nSo, that's one equation: ac + bd = 0.\n\nAdditionally, the four points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, so a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1, and c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, now, I have three equations:\n\n1. a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\n2. c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\n3. ac + bd = 0.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2.

Now, diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin. So, diagonal AC must pass through the origin as well. So, points A and C are symmetric about the origin.\n\nBut from the slope condition, slope of AC times slope of BD must be -1. Slope of BD is 0, since it's along the x-axis. So, slope of AC would be undefined (infinite) if the product must be -1. But slope of AC is (y1 - (-y1))/(x1 - (-x1))= (2y1)/(2x1)= y1/x1. So, to have slope of AC times slope of BD = -1, we have (y1/x1)*0 = -1, which is impossible. Therefore, BD cannot be along the x-axis because that would require AC to be vertical, but that would require x1=0, which is impossible as that leads to y1\u00b2=-24.\n\nTherefore, BD cannot be along the x-axis. So, the minimal case where x2\u00b2=20 is impossible because it leads to a contradiction. So, BD\u00b2 can't be 80. Therefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 must be greater than 80.\n\nSo, I need to find the minimal possible BD\u00b2, which is greater than 80, and then the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be that minimal BD\u00b2. Because BD\u00b2 can be as small as that minimal value, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be that minimal value.",

So, the vectors AC and BD are (-2x, -2y) and (-2u, -2v), respectively.\n\nSince these vectors are perpendicular, their dot product must be zero. So, (-2x)(-2u) + (-2y)(-2v) = 0. Simplifying, 4xu + 4yv = 0. Divide both sides by 4: xu + yv = 0. So, this gives me a condition that the coordinates of A and B must satisfy: xu + yv = 0.\n\nAlso, all four points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, A = (x, y) must satisfy x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, and B = (u, v) must satisfy u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nNow, the goal is to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, perhaps I can express BD\u00b2 in terms of u and v, and then find its infimum or something like that.",

The slope of AC is y1 / x1.\n\nSince diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes must be -1:\n\n( sqrt(6/5) sin\u03b8 ) * ( y1 / x1 ) = -1.\n\nSo,\n\ny1 / x1 = -1 / ( sqrt(6/5) sin\u03b8 ) = - sqrt(5/6) / sin\u03b8.\n\nBut point A is also on the hyperbola:\n\nx1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nLet me express y1 in terms of x1:\n\ny1 = - sqrt(5/6) x1 / sin\u03b8.\n\nSubstitute into the hyperbola equation:\n\nx1\u00b2/20 - [ (5/6 x1\u00b2) / sin\u00b2\u03b8 ] /24 =1.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx1\u00b2/20 - (5 x1\u00b2)/(6 *24 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) =1.\n\nWhich is:\n\nx1\u00b2/20 - (5 x1\u00b2)/(144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) =1.\n\nFactor out x1\u00b2:\n\nx1\u00b2 [ 1/20 - 5/(144 sin\u00b2\u03b8) ] =1.\n\nLet me compute the coefficient:\n\n1/20 - 5/(144 sin\u00b2\u03b8) = [ 144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 ] / (20 * 144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ).",

Because for hyperbola, we can use sec and tan for parametrization.\n\nSo, point A can be (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8). Then, since C is the opposite point, it would be (-sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, -sqrt(24) tan\u03b8).\n\nSimilarly, points B and D would be on another line through the origin, which is perpendicular to AC. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the line BD is perpendicular to AC.\n\nThe slope of AC is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). Since AC is from (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8) to (-sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, -sqrt(24) tan\u03b8), the slope is [ -sqrt(24) tan\u03b8 - sqrt(24) tan\u03b8 ] / [ -sqrt(20) sec\u03b8 - sqrt(20) sec\u03b8 ] = [ -2 sqrt(24) tan\u03b8 ] / [ -2 sqrt(20) sec\u03b8 ] = [ sqrt(24) tan\u03b8 ] / [ sqrt(20) sec\u03b8 ].\n\nSimplify this:\n\nsqrt(24)/sqrt(20) * tan\u03b8 / sec\u03b8 = sqrt(24/20) * sin\u03b8, since tan\u03b8 = sin\u03b8/cos\u03b8, sec\u03b8 = 1/cos\u03b8. So tan\u03b8/sec\u03b8 = sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, sqrt(24/20) = sqrt(6/5) = sqrt(30)/5.\n\nSo, slope of AC is (sqrt(30)/5) sin\u03b8.\n\nSince BD is perpendicular to AC, its slope is the negative reciprocal. So, slope of BD is -5/(sqrt(30) sin\u03b8).",

So, vectors AC and BD are (-2a, -2b) and (-2c, -2d), respectively.\n\nTheir dot product should be zero because the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nSo, (-2a)(-2c) + (-2b)(-2d) = 0.\n\nWhich simplifies to 4ac + 4bd = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by 4: ac + bd = 0.\n\nSo, that's one equation: ac + bd = 0.\n\nAdditionally, the four points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, so a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1, and c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, now, I have three equations:\n\n1. a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\n2. c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\n3. ac + bd = 0.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2.

Let me think.\n\nFrom sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, let me express sin\u03c6 = -5/(6 sin\u03b8).\n\nBut we need to express tan\u00b2\u03c6 in terms of sin\u03b8.\n\nWe know that tan\u00b2\u03c6 = (1 - cos\u00b2\u03c6)/cos\u00b2\u03c6 = (sin\u00b2\u03c6)/cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nBut sin\u00b2\u03c6 = [25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8)].\n\nAnd cos\u00b2\u03c6 = 1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6 =1 -25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8)= [36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25]/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nThus, tan\u00b2\u03c6 = [25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8)] / [ (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8) ) ] =25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8) * 36 sin\u00b2\u03b8/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25) )=25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25).\n\nSo, tan\u00b2\u03c6 =25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25).\n\nSubstituting back into BD\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2=80 +176*(25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25)=80 + (176*25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25).\n\nSimplify 176*25: 176*25=4400.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 +4400/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25).\n\nBut we have BD\u00b2 as a function of sin\u03b8. Let me denote s=sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 +4400/(36 s\u00b2 -25).\n\nBut we have constraints on s, since |s|=|sin\u03b8| \u22655/6, from earlier, because |sin\u03c6|\u22655/6, and sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6=-5/6.\n\nSo, s\u00b2\u226525/36.\n\nSo, s\u00b2\u226525/36.\n\nSo, 36 s\u00b2 -25 \u22650.\n\nSo, 36 s\u00b2 -25 = (6s)^2 -25, which is \u22650 because s\u00b2\u226525/36.\n\nTherefore, 36 s\u00b2 -25 is positive, so BD\u00b2 is 80 +4400/(positive number).\n\nBut our goal is to find the infimum of BD\u00b2. So, as 4400/(36 s\u00b2 -25) is a positive term, to minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize 4400/(36 s\u00b2 -25). Since 4400 is positive, and 36 s\u00b2 -25 is positive, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 occurs when 4400/(36 s\u00b2 -25) is minimized, which happens when (36 s\u00b2 -25) is maximized.",

Let me denote point B as (y, (-1/m) y) and D as (-y, (1/m) y), so the distance BD is sqrt( (y - (-y))\u00b2 + ( (-1/m y ) - (1/m y) )\u00b2 ) = sqrt( (2 y)^2 + ( (-2/m y)^2 )) = 2 y sqrt(1 + 1/m\u00b2 )\n\nIn a rhombus, the length of the diagonals can be related to the sides. Remember that the area of a rhombus is (d1 * d2)/2, and each side can be expressed in terms of the diagonals: each side is sqrt( (d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2 ). So, for our case, each side length s is sqrt( (AC/2)^2 + (BD/2)^2 )\n\nSo,\n\ns = sqrt( (x sqrt(1 + m\u00b2 ))^2 + (y sqrt(1 + 1/m\u00b2 ))^2 )\n\nBut since all sides are equal, we can set up equations for this.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to note that since all four points lie on the hyperbola, the product of the slopes of the diagonals is -1 (since they're perpendicular).",

So, the greatest number that is always less than BD\u00b2, no matter how the rhombus is arranged. So, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think step by step.\n\nI need to express BD\u00b2 in terms of the hyperbola parameters. So, BD\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2). But from the hyperbola equation, for point B, x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 = 1. Let me solve for y2\u00b2: y2\u00b2 = (x2\u00b2/20 -1)*24.\n\nSo, y2\u00b2 = (24/20)x2\u00b2 -24 = (6/5)x2\u00b2 -24.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4[ x2\u00b2 + (6/5 x2\u00b2 -24) ] = 4[ (1 + 6/5)x2\u00b2 -24 ] = 4[ (11/5)x2\u00b2 -24 ] = (44/5)x2\u00b2 -96.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = (44/5)x2\u00b2 -96.\n\nNow, I need to find the possible values of BD\u00b2. So, x2\u00b2 is determined by the hyperbola equation. From the hyperbola equation for point B: x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 =1, so x2\u00b2 must be \u2265 20 because on the hyperbola x\u00b2 \u2265 a\u00b2, where a\u00b2=20.\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 \u2265 20, which implies that BD\u00b2 = (44/5)x2\u00b2 -96 \u2265 (44/5)(20) -96 = 176 -96 =80.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is at least 80.\n\nBut can BD\u00b2 be larger? Well, as x2\u00b2 increases, BD\u00b2 increases because the coefficient is positive. So, BD\u00b2 can be made as large as possible by choosing points B further out on the hyperbola. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 80, and it can go to infinity.",

Let me read it again: \"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's like, we're looking for a number M such that M < BD\u00b2 for every possible rhombus, and M is the greatest such number. So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, because M needs to be less than all BD\u00b2, so the largest such M is the infimum.\n\nSo, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible such rhombi.\n\nSo, BD is the diagonal from B to D, which are points (x2, y2) and (-x2, -y2). So, BD is the distance between (x2,y2) and (-x2,-y2). The distance squared is (x2 - (-x2))\u00b2 + (y2 - (-y2))\u00b2 = (2x2)^2 + (2y2)^2 = 4x2\u00b2 + 4y2\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2). So, we need to find the infimum of 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2), given that (x2,y2) lies on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, and also satisfies the condition x1x2 + y1y2 = 0, with (x1,y1) also lying on the hyperbola.",

So, the dot product of vectors BD and AC should be zero.\n\nBut first, let's find what BD and AC are.\n\nPoints B and D are (r, s) and (-r, -s), so the vector BD is D - B = (-r - r, -s - s) = (-2r, -2s). Similarly, AC is C - A = (-p - p, -q - q) = (-2p, -2q).\n\nBut since the diagonals are AC and BD, their vectors are AC and BD.

So, pr + qs = 0.\n\nSo, that's one condition: pr + qs = 0.\n\nNow, another thing is that the sides of the rhombus are equal. Let's compute the distance AB and see what condition that imposes.\n\nPoint A is (p, q), point B is (r, s). The distance AB is sqrt[(r - p)\u00b2 + (s - q)\u00b2].

So, p = sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, q = sqrt(24) tan\u03c6.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nExpress this in terms of sin\u03c6 and cos\u03c6:\n\nsec\u00b2\u03c6 = 1/cos\u00b2\u03c6, tan\u00b2\u03c6 = sin\u00b2\u03c6 / cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 20 / cos\u00b2\u03c6 + 24 (sin\u00b2\u03c6 / cos\u00b2\u03c6) = [20 +24 sin\u00b2\u03c6]/cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) =4*[20 +24 sin\u00b2\u03c6]/cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 =4*(20 +24 sin\u00b2\u03c6)/cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nBut we need to express this in terms of a single variable, perhaps, using the relation sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nHmm.

Now, diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin. So, diagonal AC must pass through the origin as well. So, points A and C are symmetric about the origin.\n\nBut from the slope condition, slope of AC times slope of BD must be -1. Slope of BD is 0, since it's along the x-axis. So, slope of AC would be undefined (infinite) if the product must be -1. But slope of AC is (y1 - (-y1))/(x1 - (-x1))= (2y1)/(2x1)= y1/x1. So, to have slope of AC times slope of BD = -1, we have (y1/x1)*0 = -1, which is impossible. Therefore, BD cannot be along the x-axis because that would require AC to be vertical, but that would require x1=0, which is impossible as that leads to y1\u00b2=-24.\n\nTherefore, BD cannot be along the x-axis.

So 6 m\u00b2 -5 >0 => m\u00b2 >5/6.\n\nSo, m\u00b2 must satisfy 5/6 < m\u00b2 <6/5.\n\nSo, m\u00b2 is between 5/6 and 6/5.\n\nSo, m is any real number such that m\u00b2 is in (5/6,6/5).\n\nNow, going back to BD\u00b2 expression:\n\nBD\u00b2 = (480(m\u00b2 +1 )) / (6 m\u00b2 -5 )\n\nLet me denote t = m\u00b2, so t \u2208 (5/6, 6/5 )\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = (480 (t +1 )) / (6 t -5 )\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480 (t +1 ) / (6 t -5 )\n\nWe need to find the maximum value of this expression as t varies in (5/6, 6/5 )",

But when t approaches infinity, cosh t ~ sinh t ~ (e^t)/2, so y ~ sqrt(24)*(e^t)/2, which would go to infinity, but the hyperbola equation requires x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, so as t approaches infinity, x and y approach infinity as well. So, points A and B are approaching infinity, but their configuration as a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin is maintained.\n\nBut when m approaches 5/6 from above, f(m) approaches infinity, which suggests that BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large.

So, the greatest number that is always less than BD\u00b2, no matter how the rhombus is arranged. So, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think step by step.\n\nI need to express BD\u00b2 in terms of the hyperbola parameters. So, BD\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2). But from the hyperbola equation, for point B, x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 = 1. Let me solve for y2\u00b2: y2\u00b2 = (x2\u00b2/20 -1)*24.\n\nSo, y2\u00b2 = (24/20)x2\u00b2 -24 = (6/5)x2\u00b2 -24.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4[ x2\u00b2 + (6/5 x2\u00b2 -24) ] = 4[ (1 + 6/5)x2\u00b2 -24 ] = 4[ (11/5)x2\u00b2 -24 ] = (44/5)x2\u00b2 -96.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = (44/5)x2\u00b2 -96.\n\nNow, I need to find the possible values of BD\u00b2. So, x2\u00b2 is determined by the hyperbola equation. From the hyperbola equation for point B: x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 =1, so x2\u00b2 must be \u2265 20 because on the hyperbola x\u00b2 \u2265 a\u00b2, where a\u00b2=20.\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 \u2265 20, which implies that BD\u00b2 = (44/5)x2\u00b2 -96 \u2265 (44/5)(20) -96 = 176 -96 =80.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is at least 80.\n\nBut can BD\u00b2 be larger? Well, as x2\u00b2 increases, BD\u00b2 increases because the coefficient is positive. So, BD\u00b2 can be made as large as possible by choosing points B further out on the hyperbola. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 80, and it can go to infinity.",

So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, because M needs to be less than all BD\u00b2, so the largest such M is the infimum.\n\nSo, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible such rhombi.\n\nSo, BD is the diagonal from B to D, which are points (x2, y2) and (-x2, -y2). So, BD is the distance between (x2,y2) and (-x2,-y2). The distance squared is (x2 - (-x2))\u00b2 + (y2 - (-y2))\u00b2 = (2x2)^2 + (2y2)^2 = 4x2\u00b2 + 4y2\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2). So, we need to find the infimum of 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2), given that (x2,y2) lies on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, and also satisfies the condition x1x2 + y1y2 = 0, with (x1,y1) also lying on the hyperbola.",

So, points A and C are symmetric about the origin.\n\nBut from the slope condition, slope of AC times slope of BD must be -1. Slope of BD is 0, since it's along the x-axis. So, slope of AC would be undefined (infinite) if the product must be -1. But slope of AC is (y1 - (-y1))/(x1 - (-x1))= (2y1)/(2x1)= y1/x1. So, to have slope of AC times slope of BD = -1, we have (y1/x1)*0 = -1, which is impossible. Therefore, BD cannot be along the x-axis because that would require AC to be vertical, but that would require x1=0, which is impossible as that leads to y1\u00b2=-24.\n\nTherefore, BD cannot be along the x-axis. So, the minimal case where x2\u00b2=20 is impossible because it leads to a contradiction. So, BD\u00b2 can't be 80. Therefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 must be greater than 80.\n\nSo, I need to find the minimal possible BD\u00b2, which is greater than 80, and then the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be that minimal BD\u00b2. Because BD\u00b2 can be as small as that minimal value, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be that minimal value.",

So, the vectors AC and BD are (-2x, -2y) and (-2u, -2v), respectively.\n\nSince these vectors are perpendicular, their dot product must be zero. So, (-2x)(-2u) + (-2y)(-2v) = 0. Simplifying, 4xu + 4yv = 0. Divide both sides by 4: xu + yv = 0. So, this gives me a condition that the coordinates of A and B must satisfy: xu + yv = 0.\n\nAlso, all four points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, A = (x, y) must satisfy x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, and B = (u, v) must satisfy u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nNow, the goal is to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, perhaps I can express BD\u00b2 in terms of u and v, and then find its infimum or something like that.",

So, the greatest number that is always less than BD\u00b2, no matter how the rhombus is arranged. So, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think step by step.\n\nI need to express BD\u00b2 in terms of the hyperbola parameters. So, BD\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2). But from the hyperbola equation, for point B, x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 = 1. Let me solve for y2\u00b2: y2\u00b2 = (x2\u00b2/20 -1)*24.\n\nSo, y2\u00b2 = (24/20)x2\u00b2 -24 = (6/5)x2\u00b2 -24.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4[ x2\u00b2 + (6/5 x2\u00b2 -24) ] = 4[ (1 + 6/5)x2\u00b2 -24 ] = 4[ (11/5)x2\u00b2 -24 ] = (44/5)x2\u00b2 -96.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = (44/5)x2\u00b2 -96.\n\nNow, I need to find the possible values of BD\u00b2. So, x2\u00b2 is determined by the hyperbola equation. From the hyperbola equation for point B: x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 =1, so x2\u00b2 must be \u2265 20 because on the hyperbola x\u00b2 \u2265 a\u00b2, where a\u00b2=20.\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 \u2265 20, which implies that BD\u00b2 = (44/5)x2\u00b2 -96 \u2265 (44/5)(20) -96 = 176 -96 =80.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is at least 80.\n\nBut can BD\u00b2 be larger? Well, as x2\u00b2 increases, BD\u00b2 increases because the coefficient is positive. So, BD\u00b2 can be made as large as possible by choosing points B further out on the hyperbola. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 80, and it can go to infinity.",

So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, because M needs to be less than all BD\u00b2, so the largest such M is the infimum.\n\nSo, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible such rhombi.\n\nSo, BD is the diagonal from B to D, which are points (x2, y2) and (-x2, -y2). So, BD is the distance between (x2,y2) and (-x2,-y2). The distance squared is (x2 - (-x2))\u00b2 + (y2 - (-y2))\u00b2 = (2x2)^2 + (2y2)^2 = 4x2\u00b2 + 4y2\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2). So, we need to find the infimum of 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2), given that (x2,y2) lies on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, and also satisfies the condition x1x2 + y1y2 = 0, with (x1,y1) also lying on the hyperbola.",

So, BD\u00b2 is the square of the length of diagonal BD.\n\nBD is from point B(p,q) to D(-p,-q), so the length BD is the distance between (p,q) and (-p,-q), which is sqrt[( -p - p )\u00b2 + ( -q - q )\u00b2] = sqrt[(-2p)^2 + (-2q)^2] = sqrt[4p\u00b2 + 4q\u00b2] = 2 sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). Therefore, BD\u00b2 is (2 sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, AC\u00b2 = 4(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nBut since the hyperbola equation is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, we can write x\u00b2 = 20(1 + y\u00b2/24) = 20 + (5/6) y\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, p\u00b2 = 20(1 + q\u00b2/24) = 20 + (5/6) q\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 4[20 + (5/6) q\u00b2 + q\u00b2] = 4[20 + (11/6) q\u00b2] = 80 + (44/6) q\u00b2 = 80 + (22/3) q\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, AC\u00b2 = 4(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 4[20 + (5/6) y\u00b2 + y\u00b2] = 4[20 + (11/6) y\u00b2] = 80 + (44/6) y\u00b2 = 80 + (22/3) y\u00b2.\n\nBut since both points A and B lie on the hyperbola, we can write similar expressions.\n\nBut we also have the condition that xp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, we have x p + y q = 0.\n\nGiven that x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1 and p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24=1.\n\nSo, we have four variables x, y, p, q, with two equations from the hyperbola, and one equation xp + yq = 0.\n\nWe can perhaps express x in terms of y, and p in terms of q, and substitute into the condition.\n\nFrom the hyperbola equation, x\u00b2 = 20 + (5/6) y\u00b2,\n\nso x = sqrt(20 + (5/6) y\u00b2). Similarly, p = sqrt(20 + (5/6) q\u00b2).\n\nBut we have to be careful with the signs. Since the hyperbola has two branches, points can be on either branch. But since the diagonals intersect at the origin, and the points are A, B, C, D, perhaps A and C are on one branch, and B and D on the other? Or maybe they can be on the same branch.",

So, vectors AC and BD are (-2a, -2b) and (-2c, -2d), respectively.\n\nTheir dot product should be zero because the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nSo, (-2a)(-2c) + (-2b)(-2d) = 0.\n\nWhich simplifies to 4ac + 4bd = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by 4: ac + bd = 0.\n\nSo, that's one equation: ac + bd = 0.\n\nAdditionally, the four points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, so a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1, and c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, now, I have three equations:\n\n1. a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\n2. c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\n3. ac + bd = 0.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2.

Let me think step by step.\n\nI need to express BD\u00b2 in terms of the hyperbola parameters. So, BD\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2). But from the hyperbola equation, for point B, x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 = 1.

So, x2\u00b2 is determined by the hyperbola equation. From the hyperbola equation for point B: x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 =1, so x2\u00b2 must be \u2265 20 because on the hyperbola x\u00b2 \u2265 a\u00b2, where a\u00b2=20.\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 \u2265 20, which implies that BD\u00b2 = (44/5)x2\u00b2 -96 \u2265 (44/5)(20) -96 = 176 -96 =80.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is at least 80.\n\nBut can BD\u00b2 be larger? Well, as x2\u00b2 increases, BD\u00b2 increases because the coefficient is positive. So, BD\u00b2 can be made as large as possible by choosing points B further out on the hyperbola. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 80, and it can go to infinity.",

So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, because M needs to be less than all BD\u00b2, so the largest such M is the infimum.\n\nSo, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible such rhombi.\n\nSo, BD is the diagonal from B to D, which are points (x2, y2) and (-x2, -y2).

So, the greatest number that is always less than BD\u00b2, no matter how the rhombus is arranged. So, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think step by step.\n\nI need to express BD\u00b2 in terms of the hyperbola parameters. So, BD\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2). But from the hyperbola equation, for point B, x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 = 1. Let me solve for y2\u00b2: y2\u00b2 = (x2\u00b2/20 -1)*24.\n\nSo, y2\u00b2 = (24/20)x2\u00b2 -24 = (6/5)x2\u00b2 -24.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4[ x2\u00b2 + (6/5 x2\u00b2 -24) ] = 4[ (1 + 6/5)x2\u00b2 -24 ] = 4[ (11/5)x2\u00b2 -24 ] = (44/5)x2\u00b2 -96.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = (44/5)x2\u00b2 -96.\n\nNow, I need to find the possible values of BD\u00b2. So, x2\u00b2 is determined by the hyperbola equation. From the hyperbola equation for point B: x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 =1, so x2\u00b2 must be \u2265 20 because on the hyperbola x\u00b2 \u2265 a\u00b2, where a\u00b2=20.\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 \u2265 20, which implies that BD\u00b2 = (44/5)x2\u00b2 -96 \u2265 (44/5)(20) -96 = 176 -96 =80.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is at least 80.\n\nBut can BD\u00b2 be larger? Well, as x2\u00b2 increases, BD\u00b2 increases because the coefficient is positive. So, BD\u00b2 can be made as large as possible by choosing points B further out on the hyperbola. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 80, and it can go to infinity.",

So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, because M needs to be less than all BD\u00b2, so the largest such M is the infimum.\n\nSo, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible such rhombi.\n\nSo, BD is the diagonal from B to D, which are points (x2, y2) and (-x2, -y2).

The distance squared is (x2 - (-x2))\u00b2 + (y2 - (-y2))\u00b2 = (2x2)^2 + (2y2)^2 = 4x2\u00b2 + 4y2\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2).

Because for any lower number, there exists a BD\u00b2 larger than it, but the greatest such number that is always less than BD\u00b2 is the infimum.\n\nSo, we need to find the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2, because the infimum would be the minimum if it's achievable.\n\nSo, we need to find the minimum value of BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2), given that points A(x, y) and B(p, q) lie on the hyperbola, and their vectors are perpendicular (xp + yq = 0).\n\nSo, the problem reduces to minimizing 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) subject to:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\nxp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, we have four variables: x, y, p, q. But with three equations. So, we can perhaps express p and q in terms of x and y, or find a relation between them.\n\nGiven that xp + yq = 0, we can express q in terms of p or vice versa.\n\nLet me try to express q in terms of p. So, from xp + yq = 0 => q = (-xp)/y.\n\nBut y can't be zero, since then point A would be (x, 0), but on the hyperbola, x\u00b2/20 = 1 => x = \u00b12\u221a5. Then, point B would have to satisfy p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1 and xp + yq=0, which with y=0, requires xp = 0. Since x is non-zero (x=\u00b12\u221a5), p must be zero. Then, point B would be (0, q), but plugging into hyperbola equation, 0 - q\u00b2/24 =1 => q\u00b2 = -24, which is impossible. So, y cannot be zero. Similarly, x cannot be zero either, because if x=0, then from the hyperbola equation, -y\u00b2/24=1, which is impossible. So, x and y are non-zero.\n\nSo, q = (-xp)/y.\n\nNow, plug this into the hyperbola equation for point B:\n\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSubstitute q:\n\np\u00b2/20 - [ ( (-xp)/y )\u00b2 ] /24 = 1.\n\nSimplify:\n\np\u00b2/20 - (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/(y\u00b2 * 24) = 1.\n\nFactor out p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 [ 1/20 - (x\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2) ] = 1.\n\nLet me compute the coefficient inside the brackets:\n\n1/20 - (x\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2).\n\nBut since point A(x, y) is on the hyperbola, it satisfies x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nLet me solve for x\u00b2: x\u00b2 = 20(1 + y\u00b2/24) = 20 + (20 y\u00b2)/24 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, substituting back into the coefficient:\n\n1/20 - (20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 ) / (24 y\u00b2 ).\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo:\n\nCoefficient = 1/20 - [ (20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 ) / (24 y\u00b2) ].\n\nLet me compute this term:\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nCoefficient = 1/20 - [20/(24 y\u00b2) + (5 y\u00b2)/(6 *24 y\u00b2) ].\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n20/(24 y\u00b2) = (5)/(6 y\u00b2),\n\n(5 y\u00b2)/(6 *24 y\u00b2) = 5/(6*24) = 5/(144).\n\nSo, Coefficient = 1/20 - [5/(6 y\u00b2) + 5/144].\n\nSo, Coefficient = 1/20 - 5/(6 y\u00b2) - 5/144.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nCoefficient = (1/20 - 5/144) - 5/(6 y\u00b2).\n\nCompute 1/20 - 5/144:\n\nFind a common denominator, which is 720:\n\n1/20 = 36/720,\n\n5/144 = 25/720,\n\nSo, 36/720 -25/720 = 11/720.\n\nSo, Coefficient = 11/720 - 5/(6 y\u00b2).\n\nThus, we have:\n\np\u00b2 [ 11/720 - 5/(6 y\u00b2) ] = 1.\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2 = 1 / [ 11/720 - 5/(6 y\u00b2) ].\n\nWe can write this as:\n\np\u00b2 = 1 / [ (11 - 60/(y\u00b2) ) / 720 ] = 720 / (11 - 60/(y\u00b2)).\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = 720 / (11 - 60/(y\u00b2)).\n\nNow, remember that BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nBut from earlier, q = (-x p)/y.\n\nSo, q\u00b2 = (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/y\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4 ( p\u00b2 + (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/y\u00b2 ) =4 p\u00b2 (1 + x\u00b2/y\u00b2 ).\n\nFactor out p\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2 =4 p\u00b2 (1 + x\u00b2/y\u00b2 ).\n\nNow, x\u00b2 is 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6, from earlier.\n\nSo, 1 + x\u00b2/y\u00b2 = 1 + [20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 ] / y\u00b2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n=1 + 20/y\u00b2 + 5/6.\n\nSo, 1 + 5/6 = 11/6.\n\nThus,\n\n1 + x\u00b2/y\u00b2 = 11/6 + 20/y\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4 p\u00b2 (11/6 + 20/y\u00b2 ).\n\nBut from earlier, p\u00b2 =720 / (11 - 60/(y\u00b2)).\n\nSo, substitute p\u00b2 into BD\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2 =4 * [720 / (11 - 60/y\u00b2) ] * (11/6 + 20/y\u00b2 ).\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nFirst, compute the constants:\n\n4 *720 = 2880.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 2880 * [ (11/6 + 20/y\u00b2 ) / (11 - 60/y\u00b2 ) ].\n\nLet me denote z = 1/y\u00b2.\n\nThen,\n\nBD\u00b2 =2880 * [ (11/6 + 20 z ) / (11 - 60 z ) ].\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =2880 * [ (11/6 + 20 z ) / (11 - 60 z ) ].\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 =2880 * [ (11 + 120 z ) /6 ] / (11 -60 z )",

BD is the diagonal from B(p, q) to D(-p, -q). So, BD's length is sqrt[(-p - p)^2 + (-q - q)^2] = sqrt[(-2p)^2 + (-2q)^2] = sqrt[4p\u00b2 + 4q\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 is [2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)]\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nOur goal is to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.

Therefore, \u03b8 is such that sin\u03b8 is either \u22655/6 or \u2264-5/6.\n\nNow, let's express tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\ntan\u03c6= sin\u03c6 / cos\u03c6.\n\nWe have sin\u03c6= (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8).\n\nAnd cos\u00b2\u03c6=1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6=1 - (25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 )= (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ).\n\nSo, cos\u03c6= \u00b1sqrt( (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ))= \u00b1sqrt(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25)/(6 |sin\u03b8| ).\n\nBut we can write tan\u00b2\u03c6= sin\u00b2\u03c6 / cos\u00b2\u03c6= [25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) ] / [ (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) ]=25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25).\n\nSo, tan\u00b2\u03c6=25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 +176*(25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25 ).\n\nSimplify:\n\n=80 + (176*25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25 )=80 +4400/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25 ).\n\nLet me denote u= sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSince |sin\u03b8| \u22655/6, u \u226525/36\u22480.6944.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 +4400/(36 u -25 ).\n\nNow, we can write BD\u00b2 as a function of u:\n\nf(u)=80 +4400/(36 u -25 ), where u\u226525/36.\n\nWe need to find the minimal value of f(u) for u\u226525/36.\n\nLet me compute the derivative of f(u) with respect to u:\n\nf'(u)= -4400*36/(36 u -25 )\u00b2.\n\nSince the denominator is squared, it's positive, and 4400 and 36 are positive, so f'(u) is negative.\n\nThus, f(u) is decreasing for u\u226525/36.\n\nThus, the minimal value of f(u) is approached as u approaches infinity.",

So, 720 y\u00b2 is always positive (since y\u00b2 is non-negative, and 720 is positive). Therefore, denominator 11 y\u00b2 -600 must be positive.
