Therefore, the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, and in fact, it's a regular-faced tetrahedron.\n\nSince all faces are congruent, the inradius can be found by calculating the volume and the surface area. So, let's get started.\n\nFirst, I need to find the volume. How can I compute the volume of a tetrahedron with these edge lengths? Maybe using the Cayley-Menger determinant. I remember there's a formula that uses the edge lengths to compute the volume.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:\n\nVolume = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the Cayley-Menger determinant:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0   a\u00b2  b\u00b2  c\u00b2 |\n| 1  a\u00b2   0   d\u00b2  e\u00b2 |\n| 1  b\u00b2  d\u00b2   0   f\u00b2 |\n| 1  c\u00b2  e\u00b2  f\u00b2   0  |\n\nSo, let me list out all the squared edge lengths:\n\nAB\u00b2 = 41\n\nAC\u00b2 = 80\n\nAD\u00b2 = 89\n\nBC\u00b2 = 89\n\nBD\u00b2 = 80\n\nCD\u00b2 = 41\n\nSo, the determinant will be:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0",

We know AB = sqrt(41), so 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(41). Therefore, sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(41)/2, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 41/4.\n\nSimilarly, CD is the distance between C and D.\n\nCD = sqrt[(p - (-p))\u00b2 + (q - (-q))\u00b2 + (r - (-r))\u00b2] = sqrt[(2p)\u00b2 + (2q)\u00b2 + (2r)\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2). Given CD = sqrt(41), so 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2) = sqrt(41), which implies p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 41/4.\n\nSame as for A and B.\n\nNow, AC is the distance between A and C.\n\nAC = sqrt[(x - p)\u00b2 + (y - q)\u00b2 + (z - r)\u00b2] = sqrt(80). So,\n\n(x - p)\u00b2 + (y - q)\u00b2 + (z - r)\u00b2 = 80.\n\nSimilarly, BD is the distance between B and D.\n\nBD = sqrt[(-x - (-p))\u00b2 + (-y - (-q))\u00b2 + (-z - (-r))\u00b2]\n= sqrt[(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 + (r - z)^2] = same as AC, which is sqrt(80). So that equation is the same as AC.\n\nSimilarly, BC is the distance between B and C.\n\nBC = sqrt[(-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2 + (-z - r)^2] = sqrt( ( -x - p )\u00b2 + ( -y - q )\u00b2 + ( -z - r )\u00b2 ) = sqrt( (x + p)^2 + (y + q)^2 + (z + r)^2 ). Given BC = sqrt(89), so:\n\n(x + p)^2 + (y + q)^2 + (z + r)^2 = 89.\n\nSimilarly, AD is the distance between A and D.\n\nAD = sqrt[(x - (-p))\u00b2 + (y - (-q))\u00b2 + (z - (-r))\u00b2] = sqrt( (x + p)^2 + (y + q)^2 + (z + r)^2 ), which is same as BC, so sqrt(89). So same equation.\n\nSo, in summary, I have the following equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 41/4.\n\n2. p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 41/4.\n\n3. (x - p)\u00b2 + (y - q)\u00b2 + (z - r)\u00b2 = 80.\n\n4. (x + p)^2 + (y + q)^2 + (z + r)^2 = 89.\n\nLet me try to expand equations 3 and 4.\n\nEquation 3:\n\n(x - p)^2 + (y - q)^2 + (z - r)^2 = x\u00b2 - 2xp + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2yq + q\u00b2 + z\u00b2 - 2zr + r\u00b2 = (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) + (p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2) - 2(xp + yq + zr) = 80.\n\nFrom equations 1 and 2, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 41/4 and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 41/4. So adding them: 41/4 + 41/4 = 82/4 = 41/2.\n\nSo equation 3 becomes: 41/2 - 2(xp + yq + zr) = 80.\n\nSo, 41/2 - 80 = 2(xp + yq + zr).\n\nCompute 41/2 - 80: 41/2 is 20.5, 80 is 80.0, so 20.5 - 80 = -59.5, which is -119/2.\n\nSo, -119/2 = 2(xp + yq + zr) => xp + yq + zr = (-119/2)/2 = -119/4.\n\nSimilarly, equation 4:\n\n(x + p)^2 + (y + q)^2 + (z + r)^2 = x\u00b2 + 2xp + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2yq + q\u00b2 + z\u00b2 + 2zr + r\u00b2 = (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) + (p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2) + 2(xp + yq + zr) = 89.\n\nAgain, from equations 1 and 2, sum is 41/2.\n\nSo equation 4 becomes: 41/2 + 2(xp + yq + zr) = 89.\n\nWe already found that xp + yq + zr = -119/4.\n\nSo plug that in:\n\n41/2 + 2*(-119/4) = 41/2 - 238/4 = 41/2 - 119/2 = (41 - 119)/2 = (-78)/2 = -39.",

Similarly, point D will be somewhere in 3D space, say (r, s, t).\n\nGiven that AC = \u221a80, so distance from A(0,0,0) to C(p, q, 0) is \u221a(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = \u221a80, so p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 80.\n\nSimilarly, BC = \u221a89, so distance from B(\u221a41, 0, 0) to C(p, q, 0) is \u221a[(p - \u221a41)^2 + q\u00b2] = \u221a89, so (p - \u221a41)^2 + q\u00b2 = 89.\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1. p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 80\n\n2.

Similarly, the midpoint of CD is ((p + (-p))/2, (q + (-q))/2, (r + (-r))/2) = (0, 0, 0). So midpoints are the same.\n\nNow, let's compute the distances.\n\nFirst, AB: distance between A and B.\n\nAB = sqrt[(x - (-x))\u00b2 + (y - (-y))\u00b2 + (z - (-z))\u00b2] = sqrt[(2x)\u00b2 + (2y)\u00b2 + (2z)\u00b2] = sqrt(4x\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2) = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2).

Therefore, sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(41)/2, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 41/4.\n\nSimilarly, CD is the distance between C and D.\n\nCD = sqrt[(p - (-p))\u00b2 + (q - (-q))\u00b2 + (r - (-r))\u00b2] = sqrt[(2p)\u00b2 + (2q)\u00b2 + (2r)\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2). Given CD = sqrt(41), so 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2) = sqrt(41), which implies p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 41/4.\n\nSame as for A and B.\n\nNow, AC is the distance between A and C.\n\nAC = sqrt[(x - p)\u00b2 + (y - q)\u00b2 + (z - r)\u00b2] = sqrt(80). So,\n\n(x - p)\u00b2 + (y - q)\u00b2 + (z - r)\u00b2 = 80.\n\nSimilarly, BD is the distance between B and D.\n\nBD = sqrt[(-x - (-p))\u00b2 + (-y - (-q))\u00b2 + (-z - (-r))\u00b2]\n= sqrt[(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 + (r - z)^2] = same as AC, which is sqrt(80). So that equation is the same as AC.\n\nSimilarly, BC is the distance between B and C.\n\nBC = sqrt[(-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2 + (-z - r)^2] = sqrt( ( -x - p )\u00b2 + ( -y - q )\u00b2 + ( -z - r )\u00b2 ) = sqrt( (x + p)^2 + (y + q)^2 + (z + r)^2 ).

So adding them: 41/4 + 41/4 = 82/4 = 41/2.\n\nSo equation 3 becomes: 41/2 - 2(xp + yq + zr) = 80.\n\nSo, 41/2 - 80 = 2(xp + yq + zr).\n\nCompute 41/2 - 80: 41/2 is 20.5, 80 is 80.0, so 20.5 - 80 = -59.5, which is -119/2.\n\nSo, -119/2 = 2(xp + yq + zr) => xp + yq + zr = (-119/2)/2 = -119/4.\n\nSimilarly, equation 4:\n\n(x + p)^2 + (y + q)^2 + (z + r)^2 = x\u00b2 + 2xp + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2yq + q\u00b2 + z\u00b2 + 2zr + r\u00b2 = (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) + (p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2) + 2(xp + yq + zr) = 89.\n\nAgain, from equations 1 and 2, sum is 41/2.\n\nSo equation 4 becomes: 41/2 + 2(xp + yq + zr) = 89.\n\nWe already found that xp + yq + zr = -119/4.\n\nSo plug that in:\n\n41/2 + 2*(-119/4) = 41/2 - 238/4 = 41/2 - 119/2 = (41 - 119)/2 = (-78)/2 = -39.",
