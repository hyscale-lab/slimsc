So, whether starting with right or up, the counts of right and up segments are 3 and 2, or 2 and 3.\n\nSo, for each case, we can compute the number of paths, and then add them together.\n\nSo, the problem becomes: for each case, find the number of ways to distribute the 8 right moves into 3 segments, and 8 up moves into 2 segments (for case 1), and vice versa for case 2.\n\nSo, in case 1: 3 right segments and 2 up segments.\n\nEach right segment must have at least 1 move, because you can't have a segment of zero length. Similarly, each up segment must have at least 1 move.\n\nSo, for the right segments: we need to distribute 8 right moves into 3 segments, each at least 1. The number of ways is equal to the number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts, which is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21.\n\nSimilarly, for the up segments: distribute 8 up moves into 2 segments, each at least 1.

So for four direction changes, the path could either have 3 right segments and 2 up segments, or 3 up segments and 2 right segments. So I need to calculate both cases and sum them.\n\nSo, let's compute for each case.\n\nFirst, let's take Case 1: Starting with right, so 3 right segments and 2 up segments.\n\nWe have R1 + R2 + R3 =8, where R1, R2, R3 are positive integers (since each segment must have at least one step).
