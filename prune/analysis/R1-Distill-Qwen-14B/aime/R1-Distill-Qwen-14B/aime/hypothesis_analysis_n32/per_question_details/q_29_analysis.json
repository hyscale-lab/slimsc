So, if F is at (x,16), G is at (x,16+17)=(x,33). Then, H would be at (E's x-coordinate, 33). So, rectangle EFGH would have coordinates E(x1,16), F(x2,16), G(x2,33), H(x1,33).\n\nSo, points G and H are at (x2,33) and (x1,33).\n\nNow, the four points A(0,0), D(0,16), H(x1,33), G(x2,33) lie on a circle. So, these four points must lie on a circle. Let's think about the equation of a circle passing through these points.\n\nThe general equation of a circle is (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2, where (h,k) is the center and r is the radius.\n\nLet's plug in the points:\n\n1. A(0,0): (0 - h)^2 + (0 - k)^2 = r^2 \u2192 h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = r\u00b2\n2. D(0,16): (0 - h)^2 + (16 - k)^2 = r\u00b2 \u2192 h\u00b2 + (16 - k)^2 = r\u00b2\n3.

G(x2,33): (x2 - h)^2 + (33 - k)^2 = r\u00b2\n\nFrom equations 1 and 2, subtracting 1 from 2:\n\n[h\u00b2 + (16 - k)^2] - [h\u00b2 + k\u00b2] = 0 \u2192 (16 - k)^2 - k\u00b2 = 0 \u2192 256 - 32k + k\u00b2 - k\u00b2 = 0 \u2192 256 -32k =0 \u2192 32k=256 \u2192 k=8.\n\nSo, the y-coordinate of the center is 8. So, k=8.\n\nNow, substituting k=8 into equation 1: h\u00b2 + 8\u00b2 = r\u00b2 \u2192 r\u00b2 = h\u00b2 +64.\n\nNow, let's look at points H and G. Let's plug H into the circle equation:\n\n(x1 - h)^2 + (33 -8)^2 = r\u00b2 \u2192 (x1 -h)^2 + 25\u00b2 = r\u00b2 \u2192 (x1 -h)^2 + 625 = h\u00b2 +64 \u2192 (x1 - h)^2 = h\u00b2 +64 -625 \u2192 (x1 -h)^2 = h\u00b2 -561.\n\nSimilarly, for point G(x2,33):\n\n(x2 - h)^2 + (33 -8)^2 = r\u00b2 \u2192 (x2 - h)^2 +625 = h\u00b2 +64 \u2192 (x2 - h)^2 = h\u00b2 -561.\n\nSo, both (x1 -h)^2 and (x2 -h)^2 equal h\u00b2 -561. Therefore, x1 -h = \u00b1sqrt(h\u00b2 -561) and x2 -h = \u00b1sqrt(h\u00b2 -561).\n\nBut since EFGH is a rectangle, and EF is from E(x1,16) to F(x2,16), the length EF is |x2 -x1|=184. So, |(x2 -h) - (x1 -h)| = |x2 -x1|=184. But (x2 -h) and (x1 -h) are both sqrt(h\u00b2 -561) but possibly with opposite signs.",

Hmm, perhaps I should have E at (a,0), between D(0,0) and C(107,0), so 0 < a <107.\n\nThen, F would be beyond C, so F is at (107 + d, 0), where d>0.\n\nSo, EF would be the distance from E(a,0) to F(107 + d,0), which is (107 + d -a) units. Given that EF=184, so 107 + d -a=184 \u2192 d= a +77.\n\nSo, F is at (107 + (a +77),0)= (184 +a, 0).\n\nSo, rectangle EFGH has E(a,0), F(184 +a,0). Since EF is along the x-axis, FG is vertical, either upwards or downwards. Let's take upwards, so H is at (a,17) and G is at (184 +a,17).\n\nNow, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. Point A is at (0, h), where h is the height of the rectangle ABCD, which is AB=107, but wait, no, ABCD is a rectangle with AB=107, BC=16. So, AB is the top side, BC is the right side, so height is 16. So, point A would be at (0,16), point D at (0,0), point B at (107,16), point C at (107,0).\n\nSo, points:\n\n- A: (0,16)\n- D: (0,0)\n- H: (a,17)\n- G: (184 +a,17)\n\nAll lying on a circle.\n\nNow, to find the circle passing through these four points, let's use the general equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx + 2fy + c =0.\n\nPlugging in each point:\n\n1.

Let me try to parse it step by step. \n\nThere are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, the points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the problem. There are two rectangles. Rectangle ABCD has sides AB and BC. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so BC = AD = 16, and AB = CD = 107. Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides EF = 184 and FG = 17, so FG = EH = 17 and EF = GH = 184.\n\nNow, points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if I imagine the line that passes through D, E, C, F, these four points lie on a straight line. Let me denote this line as line L.\n\nAlso, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, these four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. That might be important, perhaps implying some cyclic quadrilateral properties.\n\nLet me try to draw this in my mind. Let's have rectangle ABCD with AB = 107 and BC = 16. So, ABCD is a rectangle where AB is the longer side. Then, rectangle EFGH is another rectangle; since EF is 184 and FG is 17, EF is longer than FG, so EFGH is a taller and skinnier rectangle compared to ABCD.\n\nPoints D, E, C, F are on the same line, so the line L that they lie on must be a common line for both rectangles. Perhaps rectangles are placed side by side along this line?",
          "text2": "But wait, if E and F are on the x-axis, and EF is 184, which is longer than DC which is 107. That's impossible because DC is only 107 units. So, unless E and F are extended beyond D and C.\n\nAh, that makes sense. So, E could be to the left of D, and F could be to the right of C, or vice versa, so that the distance between E and F is 184. So, let's say E is at (e, 0) where e < 0, and F is at (f, 0) where f > 107. Then, the distance between E and F is f - e = 184.\n\nSo, given that, I can assign E to be at (e, 0) and F at (e + 184, 0). Since EF is 184.\n\nNow, rectangle EFGH has sides EF = 184 and FG = 17. So, from F, moving up or down 17 units to get to G or H. Let's assume it's upwards for simplicity, but it might not matter. So, point F is at (e + 184, 0). Then, point G would be at (e + 184, 17), and point H at (e, 17). So, rectangle EFGH has vertices at E(e, 0), F(e + 184, 0), G(e + 184, 17), H(e, 17).\n\nNow, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. Remember, point A is at (0,16), D is at (0,0), H is at (e, 17), and G is at (e + 184, 17). So, these four points are on a circle.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the value of e such that these four points lie on a circle. Once e is found, we can find CE.",

Let me try to visualize the problem first.\n\nWe have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, so they lie on a straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. Hmm, that's interesting. So, A, D, H, G are concyclic, meaning they lie on the same circle.\n\nThe given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find CE.\n\nFirst, let me sketch this out mentally. Rectangle ABCD has sides AB = 107 and BC = 16. So, it's a tall and narrow rectangle. Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle with EF = 184 and FG = 17. So, that's a much longer and wider rectangle.\n\nSince D, E, C, F are collinear, I can imagine them lying on a straight line. Let me consider the order. It must be D, E, F, C because in rectangle ABCD, C is opposite to A, and in EFGH, F is opposite to H. So perhaps E is between D and F, and F is between E and C? Or maybe another order? Hmm, not sure yet. Let me think.\n\nAlso, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, those four points form a cyclic quadrilateral. Maybe I can use some properties of cyclic quadrilaterals here.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates of the points to make it easier. Let's place rectangle ABCD on a coordinate system. Let me assign coordinates to the points:\n\nLet\u2019s place point A at (0, 0). Since AB = 107, point B would be at (107, 0). BC = 16, so point C is at (107, 16), and point D is at (0, 16).",

So, it's 92.\n\nSo, e + g + 92 = 0 \u2192 e + g = -92 \u2192 g = -92 - e.\n\nNow, from Equation 1:\n\ne\u00b2 + 2g e + 17 = 0.\n\nSubstitute g = -92 - e:\n\ne\u00b2 + 2*(-92 - e)*e + 17 = 0.\n\nExpand:\n\ne\u00b2 - 184 e - 2 e\u00b2 + 17 = 0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\ne\u00b2 - 184 e - 2 e\u00b2 +17 = -e\u00b2 -184 e +17 =0.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\ne\u00b2 + 184 e - 17 =0.\n\nSo, quadratic equation: e\u00b2 + 184 e - 17 = 0.\n\nSolving for e:\n\ne = [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(184^2 + 4*17)] / 2.\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n184^2 = (180 +4)^2 = 180\u00b2 + 2*180*4 +4\u00b2 = 32400 + 1440 +16= 32400+1440=33840, 33840+16=33856.\n\nSo discriminant is 33856 + 68= 33924.\n\nCompute sqrt(33924):\n\nWell, 184\u00b2 is 33856, so 184\u00b2 + 68 = 33924.\n\nCompute sqrt(33924).

          "text2": "Wait, 8481? Let me check if 8481 is a perfect square.\n\nHmm, 92^2=8464, 93^2=8649. So, 8481 is between 92\u00b2 and 93\u00b2. 92\u00b2=8464, 8481-8464=17, so 8481=92\u00b2 +17. So, sqrt(8481) is irrational. So, we can't simplify this further. Hence, sqrt(33924)=2*sqrt(8481).\n\nBut maybe I can factor 8481. Let's see.\n\n8481 divided by 3: 8+4+8+1=21, which is divisible by 3. 8481/3=2827.\n\n2827: Let's check divisibility. 2+8+2+7=19, not divisible by 3. Check 2827/7=404, since 7*400=2800, 7*4=28, so 7*404=2828. Close, but 2827 is 2828-1, so not divisible by 7.\n\nNext, 2827/11: 11*257=2827? Let's see, 11*250=2750, 11*7=77, so 2750+77=2827. So, yes! 2827=11*257.\n\nSo, 8481=3*11*257. Therefore, sqrt(8481)=sqrt(3*11*257), which doesn't simplify further.\n\nSo, sqrt(33924)=2*sqrt(8481)=2*sqrt(3*11*257). Therefore, e = [ -184 \u00b1 2*sqrt(8481) ] /2 = -92 \u00b1 sqrt(8481).\n\nSo, two solutions:\n\ne = -92 + sqrt(8481) \u2248 -92 +92.12\u22480.12.\n\ne = -92 - sqrt(8481)\u2248-92 -92.12\u2248-184.12.\n\nSo, e is either approximately 0.12 or -184.12.\n\nSo, in the coordinate system, E is at (e,0). Since D is at (0,0), C is at (107,0), F is at (e +184,0).\n\nIf e is positive, around 0.12, then F is at 0.12 +184\u2248184.12, which is way beyond C (107,0).\n\nIf e is negative, around -184.12, then F is at -184.12 +184\u2248-0.12, which is just left of D (0,0).\n\nBut the problem says that D, E, C, F are collinear in that order. So, D at 0, E somewhere, then C at 107, then F further on. So, E must be between D and C, which would mean e is between 0 and 107.\n\nBut our solutions for e are approximately 0.12 and -184.12. So, 0.12 is between 0 and 107, so that's the valid solution. So, e\u22480.12, and f\u2248184.12.\n\nBut perhaps we can find CE.\n\nPoint C is at (107,0), and point E is at (e,0), so CE is |107 - e|.\n\nWe have e = -92 + sqrt(8481). So, CE =107 - e =107 - (-92 + sqrt(8481))=107 +92 - sqrt(8481)=199 - sqrt(8481).",

So 368 *92=33856.\n\nSo, 33856 /368=92.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\na + g +92 = 0 \u2192 a + g = -92 \u2192 g = -92 -a.\n\nNow, from equation (1):\n\na\u00b2 + 2g a +17=0.\n\nSubstitute g = -92 -a into equation (1):\n\na\u00b2 + 2*(-92 -a)*a +17=0.\n\nMultiply out:\n\na\u00b2 - 184a - 2a\u00b2 + 17 = 0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\na\u00b2 -2a\u00b2 = -a\u00b2\n\n-184a remains.\n\nSo, -a\u00b2 -184a +17=0.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 to make it easier:\n\na\u00b2 + 184a -17 = 0.\n\nNow, solve for 'a' using quadratic formula.\n\na = [ -184 \u00b1 sqrt(184\u00b2 -4*1*(-17)) ] / (2*1).\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n184\u00b2 = (180 +4)^2 = 180\u00b2 + 2*180*4 +4\u00b2 = 32400 + 1440 + 16 = 32400 +1440=33840 +16= 33856.\n\n4*1*(-17) = -68.\n\nSo, discriminant is 33856 - (-68)*4?",

The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the problem. There are two rectangles. Rectangle ABCD has sides AB and BC. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so BC = AD = 16, and AB = CD = 107. Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides EF = 184 and FG = 17, so FG = EH = 17 and EF = GH = 184.\n\nNow, points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if I imagine the line that passes through D, E, C, F, these four points lie on a straight line. Let me denote this line as line L.\n\nAlso, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, these four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. That might be important, perhaps implying some cyclic quadrilateral properties.\n\nLet me try to draw this in my mind. Let's have rectangle ABCD with AB = 107 and BC = 16. So, ABCD is a rectangle where AB is the longer side. Then, rectangle EFGH is another rectangle; since EF is 184 and FG is 17, EF is longer than FG, so EFGH is a taller and skinnier rectangle compared to ABCD.\n\nPoints D, E, C, F are on the same line, so the line L that they lie on must be a common line for both rectangles.

Equation (2).\n\nThen, since f = e +184, substituted into equation (2):\n\n(e +184)^2 +2g (e +184) +17=0.\n\nWhich expanded to e\u00b2 +368 e + 33856 +2g e + 368g +17=0.\n\nThen, using equation (1): e\u00b2 +2g e= -17.\n\nSubstituting, we get (-17) +368 e +33856 +368g +17=0 \u2192 368 e +368 g +33856=0.\n\nDivide by 368: e + g + (33856 / 368)=0.\n\nCompute 33856 / 368: Let's see, 368*92= 368*(90+2)=368*90=33120, 368*2=736 \u2192 33120+736=33856. So, 33856 /368=92.\n\nSo, equation becomes: e + g +92=0 \u2192 e + g= -92. Equation (3).\n\nFrom equation (1): e\u00b2 +2g e= -17.\n\nFrom equation (3): g= -92 -e.\n\nSubstitute g into equation (1):\n\ne\u00b2 +2*(-92 -e)*e= -17 \u2192 e\u00b2 -184 e -2 e\u00b2= -17 \u2192 -e\u00b2 -184 e = -17 \u2192 e\u00b2 +184 e =17.\n\nSo, e\u00b2 +184 e -17=0 \u2192 same as before.\n\nSo, quadratic equation e\u00b2 +184 e -17=0.",

So, plugging these into the circle equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +2gx +2fy +c=0.\n\nWe found c=0 because D is on the circle. Then, using A, we found f=-8. Then, using H and G, we got the equations e\u00b2 + 2ge +17=0 and f\u00b2 + 2gf +17=0, leading to e*f=17 and f =e +184.\n\nSo, e*(e +184)=17, which gives e\u00b2 +184 e -17=0.\n\nTherefore, e = [ -184 \u00b1 sqrt(184\u00b2 +4*17) ] /2.\n\nWhich is sqrt(33924) as before.\n\nSo, e is either -92 + sqrt(8481) or -92 - sqrt(8481). Only the first is positive, so e= -92 + sqrt(8481). So, CE is 107 -e =107 - (-92 + sqrt(8481))=199 - sqrt(8481).",

Let me try to visualize the problem first.\n\nWe have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, so they lie on a straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. Hmm, that's interesting. So, A, D, H, G are concyclic, meaning they lie on the same circle.\n\nThe given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find CE.\n\nFirst, let me sketch this out mentally. Rectangle ABCD has sides AB = 107 and BC = 16. So, it's a tall and narrow rectangle. Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle with EF = 184 and FG = 17. So, that's a much longer and wider rectangle.\n\nSince D, E, C, F are collinear, I can imagine them lying on a straight line. Let me consider the order. It must be D, E, F, C because in rectangle ABCD, C is opposite to A, and in EFGH, F is opposite to H. So perhaps E is between D and F, and F is between E and C? Or maybe another order? Hmm, not sure yet. Let me think.\n\nAlso, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, those four points form a cyclic quadrilateral. Maybe I can use some properties of cyclic quadrilaterals here.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates of the points to make it easier. Let's place rectangle ABCD on a coordinate system. Let me assign coordinates to the points:\n\nLet\u2019s place point A at (0, 0). Since AB = 107, point B would be at (107, 0). BC = 16, so point C is at (107, 16), and point D is at (0, 16).",

Since all four points lie on this circle, substituting each point into the equation should satisfy it.\n\nLet me plug in point D (0,0) into the circle equation:\n\n0\u00b2 + 0\u00b2 + 2g*0 + 2f*0 + c = 0 => c = 0.\n\nSo, the equation simplifies to x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx + 2fy = 0.\n\nNow, plug in point A (0,16):\n\n0\u00b2 + 16\u00b2 + 2g*0 + 2f*16 = 0 => 256 + 32f = 0 => 32f = -256 => f = -8.\n\nSo, now the equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx - 16y = 0.\n\nNow, let's plug in point H (e,17):\n\ne\u00b2 + 17\u00b2 + 2g*e -16*17 = 0.\n\nCalculating 17\u00b2 is 289, and 16*17 is 272. So:\n\ne\u00b2 + 289 + 2g e - 272 = 0 => e\u00b2 + 289 - 272 + 2g e = 0 => e\u00b2 + 17 + 2g e = 0. Equation (1).\n\nSimilarly, plug in point G (e + 184, 17):\n\n(e + 184)\u00b2 + 17\u00b2 + 2g*(e + 184) -16*17 = 0.\n\nExpanding (e + 184)^2: e\u00b2 + 368e + 184\u00b2. 184\u00b2 is 33856.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\ne\u00b2 + 368e + 33856 + 289 + 2g e + 368g - 272 = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\ne\u00b2 + 368e + 33856 + 289 + 2g e + 368g - 272 = 0.\n\nCombine constants: 33856 + 289 = 34145; 34145 - 272 = 33873.\n\nSo:\n\ne\u00b2 + 368e + 33873 + 2g e + 368g = 0.\n\nLet me group terms:\n\ne\u00b2 + (368 + 2g)e + 33873 + 368g = 0. Equation (2).\n\nNow, from equation (1): e\u00b2 + 2g e +17 = 0.\n\nLet me subtract equation (1) multiplied by 1 from equation (2):\n\nEquation (2): e\u00b2 + (368 + 2g)e + 33873 + 368g = 0.\n\nEquation (1) multiplied by 1: e\u00b2 + 2g e +17 = 0.\n\nSubtracting (1) from (2):\n\n[e\u00b2 - e\u00b2] + [ (368 + 2g)e - 2g e ] + [33873 + 368g -17] = 0.\n\nSimplify each bracket:\n\nFirst term is 0.\n\nSecond term: 368e.\n\nThird term: 33873 + 368g -17 = 33856 + 368g.\n\nSo, 368e + 33856 + 368g = 0.\n\nFactor out 368:\n\n368*(e + g) + 33856 = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by 368:\n\ne + g + (33856 / 368) = 0.\n\nCalculate 33856 / 368:\n\nLet me compute that. 368 * 92 = 368*(90 +2) = 368*90=33120, 368*2=736; 33120 +736=33856. So, 33856 /368=92.\n\nSo:\n\ne + g +92=0 => e + g = -92. Equation (3).\n\nNow, from equation (1): e\u00b2 + 2g e +17 =0.\n\nWe can write this as e\u00b2 + 2g e = -17. Equation (1a).\n\nWe have equation (3): e + g = -92 => g = -92 - e.\n\nSubstitute g into equation (1a):\n\ne\u00b2 + 2*(-92 - e)*e = -17.\n\nCompute:\n\ne\u00b2 - 184 e - 2e\u00b2 = -17.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\ne\u00b2 - 2e\u00b2 = -e\u00b2.\n\nSo:\n\n- e\u00b2 - 184 e = -17.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\ne\u00b2 + 184 e = 17.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\ne\u00b2 + 184 e -17 = 0.\n\nNow, solve this quadratic equation for e.\n\nThe quadratic equation is e\u00b2 + 184 e -17 =0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\ne = [ -184 \u00b1 sqrt(184\u00b2 + 4*1*17) ] / 2.\n\nCompute discriminant: 184\u00b2 + 68.\n\n184\u00b2 is (180 +4)^2 = 180\u00b2 + 2*180*4 +4\u00b2=32400 +1440 +16=33856.\n\nSo, discriminant is 33856 + 68=33924.\n\nWhat's sqrt(33924)? Let me compute.\n\nI know that 184\u00b2 =33856, so sqrt(33856)=184.\n\nCompute 184\u00b2 = 33856.\n\n33924 -33856=68.\n\nSo, sqrt(33924)=sqrt(184\u00b2 +68).",

          "text2": "Wait, 8481? Let me check if 8481 is a perfect square.\n\nHmm, 92^2=8464, 93^2=8649. So, 8481 is between 92\u00b2 and 93\u00b2. 92\u00b2=8464, 8481-8464=17, so 8481=92\u00b2 +17. So, sqrt(8481) is irrational. So, we can't simplify this further. Hence, sqrt(33924)=2*sqrt(8481).\n\nBut maybe I can factor 8481. Let's see.\n\n8481 divided by 3: 8+4+8+1=21, which is divisible by 3. 8481/3=2827.\n\n2827: Let's check divisibility. 2+8+2+7=19, not divisible by 3. Check 2827/7=404, since 7*400=2800, 7*4=28, so 7*404=2828. Close, but 2827 is 2828-1, so not divisible by 7.\n\nNext, 2827/11: 11*257=2827? Let's see, 11*250=2750, 11*7=77, so 2750+77=2827. So, yes! 2827=11*257.\n\nSo, 8481=3*11*257. Therefore, sqrt(8481)=sqrt(3*11*257), which doesn't simplify further.\n\nSo, sqrt(33924)=2*sqrt(8481)=2*sqrt(3*11*257). Therefore, e = [ -184 \u00b1 2*sqrt(8481) ] /2 = -92 \u00b1 sqrt(8481).\n\nSo, two solutions:\n\ne = -92 + sqrt(8481) \u2248 -92 +92.12\u22480.12.\n\ne = -92 - sqrt(8481)\u2248-92 -92.12\u2248-184.12.\n\nSo, e is either approximately 0.12 or -184.12.\n\nSo, in the coordinate system, E is at (e,0). Since D is at (0,0), C is at (107,0), F is at (e +184,0).\n\nIf e is positive, around 0.12, then F is at 0.12 +184\u2248184.12, which is way beyond C (107,0).\n\nIf e is negative, around -184.12, then F is at -184.12 +184\u2248-0.12, which is just left of D (0,0).\n\nBut the problem says that D, E, C, F are collinear in that order. So, D at 0, E somewhere, then C at 107, then F further on. So, E must be between D and C, which would mean e is between 0 and 107.\n\nBut our solutions for e are approximately 0.12 and -184.12. So, 0.12 is between 0 and 107, so that's the valid solution. So, e\u22480.12, and f\u2248184.12.\n\nBut perhaps we can find CE.\n\nPoint C is at (107,0), and point E is at (e,0), so CE is |107 - e|.\n\nWe have e = -92 + sqrt(8481). So, CE =107 - e =107 - (-92 + sqrt(8481))=107 +92 - sqrt(8481)=199 - sqrt(8481).",

Which is E, D, C, F, but F is at (-3,0), which is left of D, so the order wouldn't be D, E, C, F. So, this case is invalid.\n\nThus, e=3.

The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the problem. There are two rectangles. Rectangle ABCD has sides AB and BC. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so BC = AD = 16, and AB = CD = 107. Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides EF = 184 and FG = 17, so FG = EH = 17 and EF = GH = 184.\n\nNow, points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if I imagine the line that passes through D, E, C, F, these four points lie on a straight line. Let me denote this line as line L.\n\nAlso, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, these four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. That might be important, perhaps implying some cyclic quadrilateral properties.\n\nLet me try to draw this in my mind. Let's have rectangle ABCD with AB = 107 and BC = 16. So, ABCD is a rectangle where AB is the longer side. Then, rectangle EFGH is another rectangle; since EF is 184 and FG is 17, EF is longer than FG, so EFGH is a taller and skinnier rectangle compared to ABCD.\n\nPoints D, E, C, F are on the same line, so the line L that they lie on must be a common line for both rectangles.

Let me try to visualize the problem first.\n\nWe have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, so they lie on a straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. Hmm, that's interesting. So, A, D, H, G are concyclic, meaning they lie on the same circle.\n\nThe given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find CE.\n\nFirst, let me sketch this out mentally. Rectangle ABCD has sides AB = 107 and BC = 16. So, it's a tall and narrow rectangle. Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle with EF = 184 and FG = 17. So, that's a much longer and wider rectangle.\n\nSince D, E, C, F are collinear, I can imagine them lying on a straight line. Let me consider the order. It must be D, E, F, C because in rectangle ABCD, C is opposite to A, and in EFGH, F is opposite to H. So perhaps E is between D and F, and F is between E and C? Or maybe another order? Hmm, not sure yet. Let me think.\n\nAlso, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, those four points form a cyclic quadrilateral. Maybe I can use some properties of cyclic quadrilaterals here.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates of the points to make it easier. Let's place rectangle ABCD on a coordinate system. Let me assign coordinates to the points:\n\nLet\u2019s place point A at (0, 0). Since AB = 107, point B would be at (107, 0). BC = 16, so point C is at (107, 16), and point D is at (0, 16).",

Since all four points lie on this circle, substituting each point into the equation should satisfy it.\n\nLet me plug in point D (0,0) into the circle equation:\n\n0\u00b2 + 0\u00b2 + 2g*0 + 2f*0 + c = 0 => c = 0.\n\nSo, the equation simplifies to x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx + 2fy = 0.\n\nNow, plug in point A (0,16):\n\n0\u00b2 + 16\u00b2 + 2g*0 + 2f*16 = 0 => 256 + 32f = 0 => 32f = -256 => f = -8.\n\nSo, now the equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx - 16y = 0.\n\nNow, let's plug in point H (e,17):\n\ne\u00b2 + 17\u00b2 + 2g*e -16*17 = 0.\n\nCalculating 17\u00b2 is 289, and 16*17 is 272. So:\n\ne\u00b2 + 289 + 2g e - 272 = 0 => e\u00b2 + 289 - 272 + 2g e = 0 => e\u00b2 + 17 + 2g e = 0. Equation (1).\n\nSimilarly, plug in point G (e + 184, 17):\n\n(e + 184)\u00b2 + 17\u00b2 + 2g*(e + 184) -16*17 = 0.\n\nExpanding (e + 184)^2: e\u00b2 + 368e + 184\u00b2. 184\u00b2 is 33856.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\ne\u00b2 + 368e + 33856 + 289 + 2g e + 368g - 272 = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\ne\u00b2 + 368e + 33856 + 289 + 2g e + 368g - 272 = 0.\n\nCombine constants: 33856 + 289 = 34145; 34145 - 272 = 33873.\n\nSo:\n\ne\u00b2 + 368e + 33873 + 2g e + 368g = 0.\n\nLet me group terms:\n\ne\u00b2 + (368 + 2g)e + 33873 + 368g = 0. Equation (2).\n\nNow, from equation (1): e\u00b2 + 2g e +17 = 0.\n\nLet me subtract equation (1) multiplied by 1 from equation (2):\n\nEquation (2): e\u00b2 + (368 + 2g)e + 33873 + 368g = 0.\n\nEquation (1) multiplied by 1: e\u00b2 + 2g e +17 = 0.\n\nSubtracting (1) from (2):\n\n[e\u00b2 - e\u00b2] + [ (368 + 2g)e - 2g e ] + [33873 + 368g -17] = 0.\n\nSimplify each bracket:\n\nFirst term is 0.\n\nSecond term: 368e.\n\nThird term: 33873 + 368g -17 = 33856 + 368g.\n\nSo, 368e + 33856 + 368g = 0.\n\nFactor out 368:\n\n368*(e + g) + 33856 = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by 368:\n\ne + g + (33856 / 368) = 0.\n\nCalculate 33856 / 368:\n\nLet me compute that. 368 * 92 = 368*(90 +2) = 368*90=33120, 368*2=736; 33120 +736=33856. So, 33856 /368=92.\n\nSo:\n\ne + g +92=0 => e + g = -92. Equation (3).\n\nNow, from equation (1): e\u00b2 + 2g e +17 =0.\n\nWe can write this as e\u00b2 + 2g e = -17. Equation (1a).\n\nWe have equation (3): e + g = -92 => g = -92 - e.\n\nSubstitute g into equation (1a):\n\ne\u00b2 + 2*(-92 - e)*e = -17.\n\nCompute:\n\ne\u00b2 - 184 e - 2e\u00b2 = -17.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\ne\u00b2 - 2e\u00b2 = -e\u00b2.\n\nSo:\n\n- e\u00b2 - 184 e = -17.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\ne\u00b2 + 184 e = 17.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\ne\u00b2 + 184 e -17 = 0.\n\nNow, solve this quadratic equation for e.\n\nThe quadratic equation is e\u00b2 + 184 e -17 =0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\ne = [ -184 \u00b1 sqrt(184\u00b2 + 4*1*17) ] / 2.\n\nCompute discriminant: 184\u00b2 + 68.\n\n184\u00b2 is (180 +4)^2 = 180\u00b2 + 2*180*4 +4\u00b2=32400 +1440 +16=33856.\n\nSo, discriminant is 33856 + 68=33924.\n\nWhat's sqrt(33924)? Let me compute.\n\nI know that 184\u00b2 =33856, so sqrt(33856)=184.\n\nCompute 184\u00b2 = 33856.\n\n33924 -33856=68.\n\nSo, sqrt(33924)=sqrt(184\u00b2 +68).",

So, these four points must lie on a circle. Let's think about the equation of a circle passing through these points.\n\nThe general equation of a circle is (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2, where (h,k) is the center and r is the radius.\n\nLet's plug in the points:\n\n1.

G(x2,33): (x2 - h)^2 + (33 - k)^2 = r\u00b2\n\nFrom equations 1 and 2, subtracting 1 from 2:\n\n[h\u00b2 + (16 - k)^2] - [h\u00b2 + k\u00b2] = 0 \u2192 (16 - k)^2 - k\u00b2 = 0 \u2192 256 - 32k + k\u00b2 - k\u00b2 = 0 \u2192 256 -32k =0 \u2192 32k=256 \u2192 k=8.\n\nSo, the y-coordinate of the center is 8. So, k=8.\n\nNow, substituting k=8 into equation 1: h\u00b2 + 8\u00b2 = r\u00b2 \u2192 r\u00b2 = h\u00b2 +64.\n\nNow, let's look at points H and G. Let's plug H into the circle equation:\n\n(x1 - h)^2 + (33 -8)^2 = r\u00b2 \u2192 (x1 -h)^2 + 25\u00b2 = r\u00b2 \u2192 (x1 -h)^2 + 625 = h\u00b2 +64 \u2192 (x1 - h)^2 = h\u00b2 +64 -625 \u2192 (x1 -h)^2 = h\u00b2 -561.\n\nSimilarly, for point G(x2,33):\n\n(x2 - h)^2 + (33 -8)^2 = r\u00b2 \u2192 (x2 - h)^2 +625 = h\u00b2 +64 \u2192 (x2 - h)^2 = h\u00b2 -561.\n\nSo, both (x1 -h)^2 and (x2 -h)^2 equal h\u00b2 -561.

The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the problem. There are two rectangles. Rectangle ABCD has sides AB and BC. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so BC = AD = 16, and AB = CD = 107. Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides EF = 184 and FG = 17, so FG = EH = 17 and EF = GH = 184.\n\nNow, points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if I imagine the line that passes through D, E, C, F, these four points lie on a straight line. Let me denote this line as line L.\n\nAlso, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, these four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. That might be important, perhaps implying some cyclic quadrilateral properties.\n\nLet me try to draw this in my mind. Let's have rectangle ABCD with AB = 107 and BC = 16. So, ABCD is a rectangle where AB is the longer side. Then, rectangle EFGH is another rectangle; since EF is 184 and FG is 17, EF is longer than FG, so EFGH is a taller and skinnier rectangle compared to ABCD.\n\nPoints D, E, C, F are on the same line, so the line L that they lie on must be a common line for both rectangles.

Since all four points lie on this circle, substituting each point into the equation should satisfy it.\n\nLet me plug in point D (0,0) into the circle equation:\n\n0\u00b2 + 0\u00b2 + 2g*0 + 2f*0 + c = 0 => c = 0.\n\nSo, the equation simplifies to x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx + 2fy = 0.\n\nNow, plug in point A (0,16):\n\n0\u00b2 + 16\u00b2 + 2g*0 + 2f*16 = 0 => 256 + 32f = 0 => 32f = -256 => f = -8.\n\nSo, now the equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx - 16y = 0.\n\nNow, let's plug in point H (e,17):\n\ne\u00b2 + 17\u00b2 + 2g*e -16*17 = 0.\n\nCalculating 17\u00b2 is 289, and 16*17 is 272. So:\n\ne\u00b2 + 289 + 2g e - 272 = 0 => e\u00b2 + 289 - 272 + 2g e = 0 => e\u00b2 + 17 + 2g e = 0. Equation (1).\n\nSimilarly, plug in point G (e + 184, 17):\n\n(e + 184)\u00b2 + 17\u00b2 + 2g*(e + 184) -16*17 = 0.\n\nExpanding (e + 184)^2: e\u00b2 + 368e + 184\u00b2. 184\u00b2 is 33856.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\ne\u00b2 + 368e + 33856 + 289 + 2g e + 368g - 272 = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\ne\u00b2 + 368e + 33856 + 289 + 2g e + 368g - 272 = 0.\n\nCombine constants: 33856 + 289 = 34145; 34145 - 272 = 33873.\n\nSo:\n\ne\u00b2 + 368e + 33873 + 2g e + 368g = 0.\n\nLet me group terms:\n\ne\u00b2 + (368 + 2g)e + 33873 + 368g = 0. Equation (2).\n\nNow, from equation (1): e\u00b2 + 2g e +17 = 0.\n\nLet me subtract equation (1) multiplied by 1 from equation (2):\n\nEquation (2): e\u00b2 + (368 + 2g)e + 33873 + 368g = 0.\n\nEquation (1) multiplied by 1: e\u00b2 + 2g e +17 = 0.\n\nSubtracting (1) from (2):\n\n[e\u00b2 - e\u00b2] + [ (368 + 2g)e - 2g e ] + [33873 + 368g -17] = 0.\n\nSimplify each bracket:\n\nFirst term is 0.\n\nSecond term: 368e.\n\nThird term: 33873 + 368g -17 = 33856 + 368g.\n\nSo, 368e + 33856 + 368g = 0.\n\nFactor out 368:\n\n368*(e + g) + 33856 = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by 368:\n\ne + g + (33856 / 368) = 0.\n\nCalculate 33856 / 368:\n\nLet me compute that. 368 * 92 = 368*(90 +2) = 368*90=33120, 368*2=736; 33120 +736=33856. So, 33856 /368=92.\n\nSo:\n\ne + g +92=0 => e + g = -92. Equation (3).\n\nNow, from equation (1): e\u00b2 + 2g e +17 =0.\n\nWe can write this as e\u00b2 + 2g e = -17. Equation (1a).\n\nWe have equation (3): e + g = -92 => g = -92 - e.\n\nSubstitute g into equation (1a):\n\ne\u00b2 + 2*(-92 - e)*e = -17.\n\nCompute:\n\ne\u00b2 - 184 e - 2e\u00b2 = -17.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\ne\u00b2 - 2e\u00b2 = -e\u00b2.\n\nSo:\n\n- e\u00b2 - 184 e = -17.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\ne\u00b2 + 184 e = 17.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\ne\u00b2 + 184 e -17 = 0.\n\nNow, solve this quadratic equation for e.\n\nThe quadratic equation is e\u00b2 + 184 e -17 =0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\ne = [ -184 \u00b1 sqrt(184\u00b2 + 4*1*17) ] / 2.\n\nCompute discriminant: 184\u00b2 + 68.\n\n184\u00b2 is (180 +4)^2 = 180\u00b2 + 2*180*4 +4\u00b2=32400 +1440 +16=33856.\n\nSo, discriminant is 33856 + 68=33924.\n\nWhat's sqrt(33924)? Let me compute.\n\nI know that 184\u00b2 =33856, so sqrt(33856)=184.\n\nCompute 184\u00b2 = 33856.\n\n33924 -33856=68.\n\nSo, sqrt(33924)=sqrt(184\u00b2 +68).",

So, substitute e into the equation:\n\n(h -92)^2 - 2h*(h -92) = -17.\n\nExpand (h -92)^2: h^2 - 184h + 92^2.\n\n= h^2 - 184h + 8464.\n\nThen, -2h*(h -92) = -2h^2 + 184h.\n\nSo, adding them:\n\nh^2 -184h +8464 -2h^2 +184h = -h^2 + 8464.\n\nSet equal to -17:\n\n-h^2 +8464 = -17.\n\nSo, -h^2 = -17 -8464 = -8481.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1: h^2 = 8481.\n\nSo, h = sqrt(8481) or h = -sqrt(8481).",

If E is at (x,0), then F would be at (x + 184, 0), because EF is 184. Then, from F, moving up 17 units to G, so G is at (x + 184,17). Then, H would be at (x,17), completing the rectangle.\n\nSo, EFGH has coordinates E (x,0), F (x+184,0), G (x+184,17), H (x,17).\n\nNow, the problem states that points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, A is at (0,16), D is at (0,0), H is at (x,17), G is at (x+184,17).\n\nThese four points must lie on a circle. So, I need to find the position of E (and thus F, G, H) such that A, D, H, G are concyclic.\n\nSo, the key here is to find the value of x such that these four points lie on a circle.\n\nOnce I find x, I can find the position of E, and thus find CE, which is the distance between C (107,0) and E (x,0). Since both are on the x-axis, CE = |x - 107|.",

Let me try to parse it step by step. \n\nThere are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, the points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the problem. There are two rectangles. Rectangle ABCD has sides AB and BC. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so BC = AD = 16, and AB = CD = 107. Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides EF = 184 and FG = 17, so FG = EH = 17 and EF = GH = 184.\n\nNow, points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if I imagine the line that passes through D, E, C, F, these four points lie on a straight line. Let me denote this line as line L.\n\nAlso, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, these four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. That might be important, perhaps implying some cyclic quadrilateral properties.\n\nLet me try to draw this in my mind. Let's have rectangle ABCD with AB = 107 and BC = 16. So, ABCD is a rectangle where AB is the longer side. Then, rectangle EFGH is another rectangle; since EF is 184 and FG is 17, EF is longer than FG, so EFGH is a taller and skinnier rectangle compared to ABCD.\n\nPoints D, E, C, F are on the same line, so the line L that they lie on must be a common line for both rectangles. Perhaps rectangles are placed side by side along this line?",

So, unless E and F are extended beyond D and C.\n\nAh, that makes sense. So, E could be to the left of D, and F could be to the right of C, or vice versa, so that the distance between E and F is 184. So, let's say E is at (e, 0) where e < 0, and F is at (f, 0) where f > 107. Then, the distance between E and F is f - e = 184.\n\nSo, given that, I can assign E to be at (e, 0) and F at (e + 184, 0). Since EF is 184.\n\nNow, rectangle EFGH has sides EF = 184 and FG = 17. So, from F, moving up or down 17 units to get to G or H. Let's assume it's upwards for simplicity, but it might not matter. So, point F is at (e + 184, 0). Then, point G would be at (e + 184, 17), and point H at (e, 17).

Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. Hmm, that's interesting. So, A, D, H, G are concyclic, meaning they lie on the same circle.\n\nThe given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find CE.\n\nFirst, let me sketch this out mentally. Rectangle ABCD has sides AB = 107 and BC = 16. So, it's a tall and narrow rectangle. Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle with EF = 184 and FG = 17. So, that's a much longer and wider rectangle.\n\nSince D, E, C, F are collinear, I can imagine them lying on a straight line. Let me consider the order. It must be D, E, F, C because in rectangle ABCD, C is opposite to A, and in EFGH, F is opposite to H. So perhaps E is between D and F, and F is between E and C? Or maybe another order? Hmm, not sure yet. Let me think.\n\nAlso, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, those four points form a cyclic quadrilateral. Maybe I can use some properties of cyclic quadrilaterals here.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates of the points to make it easier. Let's place rectangle ABCD on a coordinate system. Let me assign coordinates to the points:\n\nLet\u2019s place point A at (0, 0). Since AB = 107, point B would be at (107, 0). BC = 16, so point C is at (107, 16), and point D is at (0, 16).",

Let me try to visualize the problem first.\n\nWe have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, so they lie on a straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. Hmm, that's interesting. So, A, D, H, G are concyclic, meaning they lie on the same circle.\n\nThe given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find CE.\n\nFirst, let me sketch this out mentally. Rectangle ABCD has sides AB = 107 and BC = 16. So, it's a tall and narrow rectangle. Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle with EF = 184 and FG = 17. So, that's a much longer and wider rectangle.\n\nSince D, E, C, F are collinear, I can imagine them lying on a straight line. Let me consider the order. It must be D, E, F, C because in rectangle ABCD, C is opposite to A, and in EFGH, F is opposite to H. So perhaps E is between D and F, and F is between E and C? Or maybe another order? Hmm, not sure yet. Let me think.\n\nAlso, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, those four points form a cyclic quadrilateral. Maybe I can use some properties of cyclic quadrilaterals here.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates of the points to make it easier. Let's place rectangle ABCD on a coordinate system. Let me assign coordinates to the points:\n\nLet\u2019s place point A at (0, 0). Since AB = 107, point B would be at (107, 0). BC = 16, so point C is at (107, 16), and point D is at (0, 16).",

Since D is at (0,0), C is at (107,0), F is at (e +184,0).\n\nIf e is positive, around 0.12, then F is at 0.12 +184\u2248184.12, which is way beyond C (107,0).\n\nIf e is negative, around -184.12, then F is at -184.12 +184\u2248-0.12, which is just left of D (0,0).\n\nBut the problem says that D, E, C, F are collinear in that order.

So, 0 < e <16, and F is at e +184, which is beyond C.\n\nSo, let's correct that.\n\nIf E is at (e,0), with 0 < e <16, then F is at (e +184,0).\n\nSo, points D(0,0), E(e,0), C(16,0), F(e+184,0). So, they are collinear in that order.\n\nSo, in this case, E is between D and C, and F is far to the right.\n\nSo, with this arrangement, the coordinates would be:\n\nRectangle EFGH:\n\nE: (e,0)\n\nF: (e +184,0)\n\nG: (e +184,17) or (e +184,-17)\n\nH: (e,17) or (e,-17)\n\nNow, since A is at (0,107), which is above the x-axis, and the circle passes through A, D, H, G, it's more likely that H and G are also above the x-axis. So, H is at (e,17), G is at (e +184,17).\n\nNow, with this setup, the four points on the circle are:\n\nA: (0,107)\n\nD: (0,0)\n\nH: (e,17)\n\nG: (e +184,17)\n\nWe can now write the equation of the circle passing through these four points.\n\nEarlier, I placed E at (h,0), but now, with E between D and C, E is at (e,0), 0 < e <16.\n\nSo, let's redo the equations with e instead of h.\n\nSo, points:\n\nA: (0,107)\n\nD: (0,0)\n\nH: (e,17)\n\nG: (e +184,17)\n\nAgain, the general equation of the circle passing through A, D, H, G is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx + 2fy + c =0.\n\nSince A is on the circle:\n\n0\u00b2 +107\u00b2 + 2g*0 + 2f*107 +c =0 => 11449 + 214f + c=0 --- (1)\n\nPoint D (0,0):\n\n0 +0 +0 +0 +c=0 => c=0 --- (2)\n\nSo, from (2), c=0. Plugging into (1):\n\n11449 +214f =0 => f= -11449/214= -53.5.\n\nSo, f= -53.5.\n\nNow, the equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +2g x -107 y=0.\n\nNow, plug point H (e,17):\n\ne\u00b2 +17\u00b2 +2g e -107*17=0.\n\nCompute:\n\ne\u00b2 +289 +2g e -1819=0.\n\nSimplify:\n\ne\u00b2 +2g e -1530=Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of CE. Let's try to break it down step by step. Sometimes these problems can get a bit tricky, especially with multiple rectangles and circles involved, but I'll take it one piece at a time.\n\nFirst, let's parse the given information. We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, and F are collinear. That means they all lie on the same straight line. Additionally, points A, D, H, and G lie on a circle. So, we have four points from the two rectangles that are concyclic, meaning they lie on the circumference of the same circle.\n\nThe given side lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. We need to find CE.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. So, AB is one side (107 units), BC is another side (16 units), which means CD is 107 and DA is 16. Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle, so FG is 17 and EF is 184, meaning EH is 17 and FG is 17, and the other sides are 184.\n\nNow, D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if I imagine the line passing through these four points, D and C are corners of the first rectangle, and E and F are corners of the second rectangle. Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, the four points A, D, H, G must form a cyclic quadrilateral.\n\nLet me try to sketch a rough drawing in my mind. So, rectangle ABCD has AB = 107, BC = 16. So, it's a tall, narrow rectangle. Rectangle EFGH has EF = 184, FG = 17, so it's a much wider and shorter rectangle.\n\nSince D, E, C, F are collinear, let's assume the line is horizontal for simplicity, though it might not be. Points D and C are adjacent vertices of rectangle ABCD, so they are connected by side DC. Similarly, E and F are adjacent vertices of rectangle EFGH, connected by side EF.",
          "text2": "Wait, but the circle passes through four points: A, D, H, G. So, these four points lie on a circle. Let me think about this condition. The points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e,17), G(f,17) lie on a circle. So, if I can find the equation of the circle passing through these four points, I can get some equations that relate e and f.\n\nBut first, let's establish the coordinates for E, F, G, H.\n\nSince EFGH is a rectangle, and E and F are on the x-axis, EF is the base, which is 184 units long. So the distance between E and F is 184. Since E and F are on the x-axis, their y-coordinates are 0. Let me denote E as (e, 0) and F as (f, 0). Then, the length EF is |f - e| = 184. Since E and F are on the x-axis and probably arranged in order, maybe E is to the left of F, so f = e + 184.\n\nNow, the rectangle EFGH has sides EF = 184 and FG = 17. So, FG is from F(f, 0) to G(f, 17) or G(f, -17). Similarly, EH is from E(e, 0) to H(e, 17) or H(e, -17). So, if the rectangle is above the x-axis, G is at (f,17) and H is at (e,17). If it's below, G and H are at (f, -17) and (e, -17).\n\nBut considering that points A(0,16) and D(0,0) are above the x-axis, it's more likely that the rectangle is above the x-axis, so I'll assume G is at (f,17) and H is at (e,17).\n\nSo now, we have four points on a circle: A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e,17), G(f,17). Let me write the general equation of a circle passing through these four points.\n\nThe general equation of a circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0.

A(0,0): (0 - h)^2 + (0 - k)^2 = r^2 \u2192 h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = r\u00b2\n2. D(0,16): (0 - h)^2 + (16 - k)^2 = r\u00b2 \u2192 h\u00b2 + (16 - k)^2 = r\u00b2\n3. H(x1,33): (x1 - h)^2 + (33 - k)^2 = r\u00b2\n4. G(x2,33): (x2 - h)^2 + (33 - k)^2 = r\u00b2\n\nFrom equations 1 and 2, subtracting 1 from 2:\n\n[h\u00b2 + (16 - k)^2] - [h\u00b2 + k\u00b2] = 0 \u2192 (16 - k)^2 - k\u00b2 = 0 \u2192 256 - 32k + k\u00b2 - k\u00b2 = 0 \u2192 256 -32k =0 \u2192 32k=256 \u2192 k=8.\n\nSo, the y-coordinate of the center is 8. So, k=8.\n\nNow, substituting k=8 into equation 1: h\u00b2 + 8\u00b2 = r\u00b2 \u2192 r\u00b2 = h\u00b2 +64.\n\nNow, let's look at points H and G. Let's plug H into the circle equation:\n\n(x1 - h)^2 + (33 -8)^2 = r\u00b2 \u2192 (x1 -h)^2 + 25\u00b2 = r\u00b2 \u2192 (x1 -h)^2 + 625 = h\u00b2 +64 \u2192 (x1 - h)^2 = h\u00b2 +64 -625 \u2192 (x1 -h)^2 = h\u00b2 -561.\n\nSimilarly, for point G(x2,33):\n\n(x2 - h)^2 + (33 -8)^2 = r\u00b2 \u2192 (x2 - h)^2 +625 = h\u00b2 +64 \u2192 (x2 - h)^2 = h\u00b2 -561.\n\nSo, both (x1 -h)^2 and (x2 -h)^2 equal h\u00b2 -561. Therefore, x1 -h = \u00b1sqrt(h\u00b2 -561) and x2 -h = \u00b1sqrt(h\u00b2 -561).\n\nBut since EFGH is a rectangle, and EF is from E(x1,16) to F(x2,16), the length EF is |x2 -x1|=184. So, |(x2 -h) - (x1 -h)| = |x2 -x1|=184. But (x2 -h) and (x1 -h) are both sqrt(h\u00b2 -561) but possibly with opposite signs.",

Hmm, perhaps I should have E at (a,0), between D(0,0) and C(107,0), so 0 < a <107.\n\nThen, F would be beyond C, so F is at (107 + d, 0), where d>0.\n\nSo, EF would be the distance from E(a,0) to F(107 + d,0), which is (107 + d -a) units. Given that EF=184, so 107 + d -a=184 \u2192 d= a +77.\n\nSo, F is at (107 + (a +77),0)= (184 +a, 0).\n\nSo, rectangle EFGH has E(a,0), F(184 +a,0). Since EF is along the x-axis, FG is vertical, either upwards or downwards. Let's take upwards, so H is at (a,17) and G is at (184 +a,17).\n\nNow, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. Point A is at (0, h), where h is the height of the rectangle ABCD, which is AB=107, but wait, no, ABCD is a rectangle with AB=107, BC=16. So, AB is the top side, BC is the right side, so height is 16. So, point A would be at (0,16), point D at (0,0), point B at (107,16), point C at (107,0).\n\nSo, points:\n\n- A: (0,16)\n- D: (0,0)\n- H: (a,17)\n- G: (184 +a,17)\n\nAll lying on a circle.\n\nNow, to find the circle passing through these four points, let's use the general equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx + 2fy + c =0.\n\nPlugging in each point:\n\n1.

Let me try to parse it step by step. \n\nThere are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, the points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the problem. There are two rectangles. Rectangle ABCD has sides AB and BC. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so BC = AD = 16, and AB = CD = 107. Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides EF = 184 and FG = 17, so FG = EH = 17 and EF = GH = 184.\n\nNow, points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if I imagine the line that passes through D, E, C, F, these four points lie on a straight line. Let me denote this line as line L.\n\nAlso, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, these four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. That might be important, perhaps implying some cyclic quadrilateral properties.\n\nLet me try to draw this in my mind. Let's have rectangle ABCD with AB = 107 and BC = 16. So, ABCD is a rectangle where AB is the longer side. Then, rectangle EFGH is another rectangle; since EF is 184 and FG is 17, EF is longer than FG, so EFGH is a taller and skinnier rectangle compared to ABCD.\n\nPoints D, E, C, F are on the same line, so the line L that they lie on must be a common line for both rectangles. Perhaps rectangles are placed side by side along this line?",
          "text2": "But wait, if E and F are on the x-axis, and EF is 184, which is longer than DC which is 107. That's impossible because DC is only 107 units. So, unless E and F are extended beyond D and C.\n\nAh, that makes sense. So, E could be to the left of D, and F could be to the right of C, or vice versa, so that the distance between E and F is 184. So, let's say E is at (e, 0) where e < 0, and F is at (f, 0) where f > 107. Then, the distance between E and F is f - e = 184.\n\nSo, given that, I can assign E to be at (e, 0) and F at (e + 184, 0). Since EF is 184.\n\nNow, rectangle EFGH has sides EF = 184 and FG = 17. So, from F, moving up or down 17 units to get to G or H. Let's assume it's upwards for simplicity, but it might not matter. So, point F is at (e + 184, 0). Then, point G would be at (e + 184, 17), and point H at (e, 17). So, rectangle EFGH has vertices at E(e, 0), F(e + 184, 0), G(e + 184, 17), H(e, 17).\n\nNow, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. Remember, point A is at (0,16), D is at (0,0), H is at (e, 17), and G is at (e + 184, 17). So, these four points are on a circle.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the value of e such that these four points lie on a circle. Once e is found, we can find CE.",

Let me try to visualize the problem first.\n\nWe have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, so they lie on a straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. Hmm, that's interesting. So, A, D, H, G are concyclic, meaning they lie on the same circle.\n\nThe given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find CE.\n\nFirst, let me sketch this out mentally. Rectangle ABCD has sides AB = 107 and BC = 16. So, it's a tall and narrow rectangle. Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle with EF = 184 and FG = 17. So, that's a much longer and wider rectangle.\n\nSince D, E, C, F are collinear, I can imagine them lying on a straight line. Let me consider the order. It must be D, E, F, C because in rectangle ABCD, C is opposite to A, and in EFGH, F is opposite to H. So perhaps E is between D and F, and F is between E and C? Or maybe another order? Hmm, not sure yet. Let me think.\n\nAlso, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, those four points form a cyclic quadrilateral. Maybe I can use some properties of cyclic quadrilaterals here.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates of the points to make it easier. Let's place rectangle ABCD on a coordinate system. Let me assign coordinates to the points:\n\nLet\u2019s place point A at (0, 0). Since AB = 107, point B would be at (107, 0). BC = 16, so point C is at (107, 16), and point D is at (0, 16).",

Let me find the equation of the circle passing through A, D, H, G.\n\nEarlier, I had the equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey =0, with F=0 and E=-16.\n\nSo, equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx -16 y =0.\n\nWe had point H: (e,17) and G: (e + 184,17) lying on this circle.\n\nSo, plug H into the equation:\n\ne\u00b2 + (17)^2 + D e -16*17 =0 \u2192 e\u00b2 + 289 + D e -272 = 0 \u2192 e\u00b2 + D e +17 =0.\n\nSimilarly, plug G into the equation:\n\n(e + 184)^2 + (17)^2 + D(e + 184) -16*17 =0.\n\nExpanding:\n\n(e\u00b2 + 368 e + 33856) + 289 + D e + 184 D - 272 =0.\n\nSimplify:\n\ne\u00b2 + 368 e + 33856 + 289 + D e + 184 D -272 = 0.\n\nCompute constants: 33856 + 289 = 34145; 34145 -272=33873.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\ne\u00b2 + (368 + D) e + 33873 + 184 D =0. (Equation 2)\n\nFrom Equation 1: e\u00b2 + D e +17=0. We can subtract Equation 1 multiplied by 1 from Equation 2.\n\nEquation 2: e\u00b2 + (368 + D) e + 33873 + 184 D =0.\n\nEquation 1 multiplied by 1: e\u00b2 + D e +17 =0.\n\nSubtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n\n[e\u00b2 - e\u00b2] + [ (368 + D) e - D e ] + [33873 + 184 D - 17] =0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n368 e + (33873 -17 + 184 D)=0.\n\nWhich is 368 e + 33856 + 184 D =0.\n\nDivide by 184:\n\n(368/184)e + (33856/184) + D =0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n2 e + 184 + D =0 \u2192 D= -2 e -184.\n\nSo, D is expressed in terms of e.\n\nNow, from Equation 1: e\u00b2 + D e +17=0.\n\nSubstitute D:\n\ne\u00b2 + (-2 e -184)e +17=0 \u2192 e\u00b2 -2 e\u00b2 -184 e +17=0 \u2192 (-e\u00b2 -184 e +17)=0 \u2192 e\u00b2 +184 e -17=0.\n\nThis is the same quadratic as before.\n\nSo, e = [ -184 \u00b1 sqrt(184\u00b2 +4*17) ] /2.\n\nCompute discriminant: 184\u00b2=33856; 4*17=68. So, sqrt(33856 +68)=sqrt(33924).\n\nAs before, sqrt(33924)=184.184 approx.\n\nSo, e = [ -184 + 184.184 ] /2 \u2248 (0.184)/2\u22480.092.\n\nSo, e\u22480.092. So, point E is at (0.092,0), almost at D.\n\nHmm, but that seems odd because then F would be at (0.092 + 184, 0)= (184.092, 0), which is way to the right of C at (107,0). So, that seems possible.\n\nNow, we need to find CE. Point C is at (107,0), E is at (e,0). So, CE is |107 - e|.\n\nSince e\u22480.092, CE\u2248107 -0.092\u2248106.908.\n\nBut the problem probably expects an exact value, not an approximate. So, let's see.\n\nFrom earlier, e\u00b2 +184 e -17=0.\n\nThe solution is e = [ -184 + sqrt(184\u00b2 +4*17) ] /2.\n\nCompute sqrt(184\u00b2 +68)=sqrt(33856 +68)=sqrt(33924).",

          "text2": "Wait, let's try this setup.\n\nAgain, writing the circle equation.\n\nPoints A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e,-17), G(e +184, -17).\n\nEquation of circle: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +2gx +2fy +c=0.\n\nPlugging D(0,0): 0 +0 +0 +0 +c=0 \u2192 c=0.\n\nSo, equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +2gx +2fy=0.\n\nPlugging A(0,16):\n\n0 +256 +0 +32f=0 \u2192 256 +32f=0 \u2192 f= -8.\n\nSo, equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +2gx -16y=0.\n\nNow, plug in H(e, -17):\n\ne\u00b2 + (-17)^2 +2g e -16*(-17)=0 \u2192 e\u00b2 +289 +2g e +272=0 \u2192 e\u00b2 +2g e +561=0. \u2014 (1)\n\nPlug in G(e +184, -17):\n\n(e +184)^2 + (-17)^2 +2g(e +184) -16*(-17)=0.\n\nCompute:\n\n(e +184)^2 =e\u00b2 + 368 e + 33856.\n\n(-17)^2=289.\n\n2g(e +184)=2g e + 368 g.\n\n-16*(-17)=272.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\ne\u00b2 +368 e +33856 +289 +2g e +368 g +272=0.\n\nSimplify:\n\ne\u00b2 + (368 +2g)e + (33856 +289 +272 +368 g) =0.\n\nCompute constants: 33856 +289=34145, +272=34417.\n\nSo, equation is e\u00b2 + (368 +2g)e + (34417 +368 g)=0. \u2014 (2)\n\nNow, subtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n\n[e\u00b2 + (368 +2g)e +34417 +368 g] - [e\u00b2 +2g e +561]=0.\n\nSimplify:\n\ne\u00b2 - e\u00b2 + (368 +2g -2g)e + (34417 +368 g -561)=0.\n\nSo,\n\n368 e + (34417 -561 +368 g)=0 \u2192 368 e + (33856 +368 g)=0.\n\nFactor out 368:\n\n368 (e + g) +33856=0.\n\nWhich is same as before:\n\n368 (e +g +92)=0 \u2192 e +g +92=0 \u2192 e +g =-92.\n\nSame as equation (3).\n\nNow, equation (1): e\u00b2 +2g e +561=0.\n\nFrom equation (3): g= -92 -e.\n\nSubstitute into equation (1):\n\ne\u00b2 +2*(-92 -e)*e +561=0.\n\nCompute:\n\ne\u00b2 -184 e -2e\u00b2 +561=0 \u2192 -e\u00b2 -184 e +561=0 \u2192 e\u00b2 +184 e -561=0.\n\nSo, quadratic equation e\u00b2 +184 e -561=0.\n\nSolutions:\n\ne = [ -184 \u00b1 sqrt(184\u00b2 +4*561) ] /2.\n\nCompute discriminant: 184\u00b2=33856, 4*561=2244. So, discriminant=33856 +2244=36100.\n\nsqrt(36100)=190.\n\nSo, e = [ -184 \u00b1190 ] /2.\n\nSo, two possibilities:\n\n1. e=( -184 +190 )/2=6/2=3.\n\n2. e=( -184 -190 )/2=(-374)/2=-187.\n\nAgain, check which one fits the order D, E, C, F.\n\nIf e=3, then E is at (3,0). Since D is at (0,0), E is at (3,0), C is at (107,0), and F is at (3 +184,0)=187,0. So, the order is D (0,0), E(3,0), C(107,0), F(187,0). Perfect, this fits the order.\n\nIf e=-187, then E is at (-187,0), F is at (-187 +184)=(-3,0). So, order would be E(-187,0), D(0,0), C(107,0), F(-3,0). Which is E, D, C, F, but F is at (-3,0), which is left of D, so the order wouldn't be D, E, C, F. So, this case is invalid.\n\nThus, e=3. So, E is at (3,0).\n\nNow, point E is at (3,0), F is at (187,0).\n\nNow, the problem is to find CE.\n\nPoint C is at (107,0), E is at (3,0). So, CE is the distance between (107,0) and (3,0).\n\nWhich is 107 -3=104.",
