For example, n(D \u2229 G) would include all people who own both D and G, regardless of other ownerships. In our problem, these would be:\n\n- The people who own exactly C, D, and G (d),\n- The people who own all four (x).\n\nSo, n(D \u2229 G) = d + x.\n\nSimilarly,\nn(D \u2229 S) = e + x,\nn(G \u2229 S) = f + x.\n\nNow, using the inclusion-exclusion principle for the union of D, G, and S:\n\nn(D \u222a G \u222a S) = n(D) + n(G) + n(S) - [n(D \u2229 G) + n(D \u2229 S) + n(G \u2229 S)] + n(D \u2229 G \u2229 S).\n\nBut n(D \u222a G \u222a S) is the number of people who own at least one of D, G, or S, which is equal to the total number of people minus those who own only C. So,\n\nn(D \u222a G \u222a S) = 900 - a, where a is the number of people owning exactly one thing (only C).",

So, for example, A \u2229 D is just A.\n\nSo, let me think of the problem in terms of four sets: A (diamond), B (golf), C (garden), D (candy hearts, which is everyone). So, D has 900.\n\nWe're given:\n\n- |A| = 195\n\n- |B| = 367\n\n- |C| = 562\n\n- |D| = 900\n\nWe also know:\n\n- Number of people with exactly two things: 437\n\n- Number with exactly three: 234\n\nWe need to find the number with all four, which is |A \u2229 B \u2229 C \u2229 D|. But since D is universal, this is |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|.\n\nSo, our target is |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|.\n\nHmm.\n\nIn inclusion-exclusion, the formula for four sets is:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C \u222a D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A \u2229 B| - |A \u2229 C| - |A \u2229 D| - |B \u2229 C| - |B \u2229 D| - |C \u2229 D| + |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| + |A \u2229 B \u2229 D| + |A \u2229 C \u2229 D| + |B \u2229 C \u2229 D| - |A \u2229 B \u2229 C \u2229 D|\n\nBut since D is universal, any intersection involving D is just the other sets. For example, |A \u2229 D| = |A|, |A \u2229 B \u2229 D| = |A \u2229 B|, and |A \u2229 B \u2229 C \u2229 D| = |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|.\n\nSo, substituting into the formula, we have:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C \u222a D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - (|A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |A| + |B \u2229 C| + |B| + |C|) + (|A \u2229 B \u2229 C| + |A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |B \u2229 C|) - |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|",

But in our setup, we're only considering those who own D plus something else. But since everyone owns D, then |A| includes all people owning A, whether or not they own B or C.
