So, n = k^2, where k is a positive integer.\n\nSo, S = a + c = k, and n = k^2 = a*b + c.\n\nSo, for each base b, we can look for integers a and c such that:\n\n1. a is in [1, b-1]\n2. c is in [0, b-1]\n3. a + c = k\n4. a*b + c = k^2\n\nWe can express c as c = k - a, then substitute into the equation:\n\na*b + (k - a) = k^2\n\nSimplify:\n\na*b + k - a = k^2\n\nFactor a:\n\na*(b - 1) + k = k^2\n\nThen, a*(b - 1) = k^2 - k\n\nSo, a = (k^2 - k) / (b - 1)\n\nSince a must be an integer, (k^2 - k) must be divisible by (b - 1).
