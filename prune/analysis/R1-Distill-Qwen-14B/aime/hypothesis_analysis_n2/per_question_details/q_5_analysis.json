If these circles are arranged along the angle bisector, then their centers might be placed at a distance equal to the inradius plus the radius of the circles?\n\nNo, wait. If a circle is tangent to side AB, its center must be at a distance equal to its radius from AB. So, if the inradius of the triangle is r, then the distance from the vertex to the point where the circle is tangent on AB is r + 34?",
          "text2": "Wait, no, actually, the distance from the vertex to the center of the circle should be equal to the radius if the circle is tangent to one side. But if the circle is also tangent to another circle, the distance between their centers would be twice the radius. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of tangent circles.\n\nBut this is getting confusing. Maybe I should try to visualize the arrangement.\n\nIf two circles are tangent to AB and BC, perhaps the triangle ABC is such that each side has a chain of circles tangent to it and each other. So, for side AB, there's a circle of radius 34 at one end, and similarly for BC, and the other sides have circles too.",
