          "text1": "Wait, wait, 13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is the same as \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0. Since angles are periodic modulo 2\u03c0, 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 (since 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0). So, 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to \u03c0/4 + \u03c0 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i*(5\u03c0/4)} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2) - i(\u221a2/2).\n\nSo, \u03b1^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-\u221a2/2) - i(\u221a2/2) ) ] \n\nMultiply that out:\n\nFirst, sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2) = (-2)/2 = -1\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(2) * (-i\u221a2/2) = (-i*2)/2 = -i\n\nSo, \u03b1^13 = 64*(-1) + 64*(-i) = -64 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, \u03b2 = 1 - i, which is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}. So, \u03b2^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i*(13\u03c0/4)}.\n\nSimilarly, 13\u03c0/4 modulo 2\u03c0 is 5\u03c0/4, as before, but since we have a negative exponent, it's e^{-i*(5\u03c0/4)} = cos(-5\u03c0/4) + i sin(-5\u03c0/4) = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2) + i(\u221a2/2).\n\nSo, \u03b2^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-\u221a2/2) + i(\u221a2/2) ) ] \n\nAgain, sqrt(2)*(-\u221a2/2) = -1, and sqrt(2)*(i\u221a2/2) = i.\n\nSo, \u03b2^13 = 64*(-1) + 64*i = -64 +64i.\n\nSo, \u03b1^13 = -64 -64i, \u03b2^13 = -64 +64i.\n\nSo, \u03b1^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\n\u03b2^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nMultiplying these two:\n\n(-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 +4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct. So, P=8321. Now, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000=8000, with a remainder of 321. So, the remainder is 321.",
          "text2": "Wait, but let me double-check my computations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me verify (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 again. 1 + i is sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}, so raised to 13th power is (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i 13\u03c0/4}.\n\n(sqrt(2))^13 is 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2). Correct.\n\n13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is equivalent to \u03c0/4 in the third revolution. So, 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0*2 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4, which is in the third quadrant. So, the angle is 5\u03c0/4, and as I computed earlier, cos and sin are -sqrt(2)/2 each. So, e^{i5\u03c0/4} is as I wrote. So, the multiplication leads to -64 -64i. Correct.\n\nSame for (1 - i)^13, which ends up as -64 +64i. Then subtracting 1 gives -65 -64i and -65 +64i. Multiplying these gives ( (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 ) = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Correct.\n\n8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with 321 left over. So, the remainder is 321.",
