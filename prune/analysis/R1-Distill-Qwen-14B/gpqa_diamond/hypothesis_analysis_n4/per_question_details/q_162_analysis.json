So to find the total area, I would integrate this over the domain where the denominator is positive, which is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 <4.\n\nSo the area should be the double integral over x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 <4 of [32/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)] dx dy.\n\nLet me switch to polar coordinates because the domain is a circle.

Because u=4-r\u00b2, du= -2r dr \u2192 (-1/2) du = r dr.\n\nSo the integral becomes (-1/2) \u222b (from u=4 to u=0) (1/u) du.\n\nWhich is (-1/2) [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0.",

So the integral becomes:\n\n\u222b (from \u03b8=0 to 2\u03c0) \u222b (from r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r\u00b2)] * r dr d\u03b8.\n\nBecause dx dy becomes r dr d\u03b8.

Then du/dr = -2r \u2192 -du/2 = r dr.\n\nSo when r=0, u=4.
