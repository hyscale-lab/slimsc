The volume of such a shell is approximately 4\u03c0d\u00b2 dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume multiplied by the number density of stars.",
          "text2": "Wait, wait. Oh right, because the number of stars is a function of distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars in a thin shell at a distance d with thickness dr would be the derivative of N with respect to d multiplied by dr. Because as you move a little bit in distance, the number of stars you encounter is the rate of change (density) times the distance interval.\n\nSo let's model this. Let me think. Let's say the number of stars is N = k * d^5, where k is some constant. So the number in a thin shell between d and d + dr would be approximately k*(d + dr)^5 - k*d^5. But when dr is very small, this is approximately k * 5 d^4 dr. So the number of stars per unit volume in distance dr is proportional to d^4.",
