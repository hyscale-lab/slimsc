Let me denote:\n\n- S is the lab frame.\n\n- S' is the frame of astronaut 1, which is moving at speed v = 0.6c in the positive x-direction relative to S.\n\nIn S, astronaut 2's velocity is u = 0.5c in the positive x-direction.\n\nWe want to find u', the velocity of astronaut 2 as seen from S' (astronaut 1's perspective).\n\nSo using the velocity addition formula:\n\nu' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c\u00b2))\n\nPlugging in u = 0.5c, v = 0.6c:\n\nu' = (0.5c - 0.6c) / [1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c\u00b2) ]\n\nSimplify numerator: 0.5 - 0.6 = -0.1, so -0.1c.\n\nDenominator: 1 - (0.3 c\u00b2)/(c\u00b2) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7\n\nSo u' = (-0.1c) / 0.7 = approximately -0.142857c.",
          "text2": "Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the velocity addition formula. Suppose we have two frames, S and S'. S' is moving at velocity u relative to S. Then, an event that has velocity v in S would have velocity v' in S' as given by v' = (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c\u00b2)).\n\nSo in this scenario, if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c relative to the lab frame (let's say the lab frame is S), and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So, from A's perspective (S' frame moving at 0.6c), what is B's speed?\n\nSo, applying the formula, u is 0.6c (the speed of S' relative to S), and v is 0.5c (B's speed in S). So v' is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c\u00b2)).\n\nCalculating numerator: 0.5c -0.6c = -0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c\u00b2)/(c\u00b2) ) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.\n\nSo v' = (-0.1c) / 0.7 \u2248 -0.1428c.",
