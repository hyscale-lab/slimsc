Let me compute that.\n\n\u03b3 is 6.6667, so \u03b3 squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 \u2248 44.444. So 1/\u03b3 squared is 9/400 = 0.0225. Then, 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So \u03b2 squared is 0.9775. Taking square root, \u03b2 \u2248 sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. So v \u2248 0.9887 c.\n\nNow, the mean decay distance L is c * \u03c4 * \u03b2.
