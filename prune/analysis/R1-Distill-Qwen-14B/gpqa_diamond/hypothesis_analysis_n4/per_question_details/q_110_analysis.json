          "text1": "Alternatively, perhaps the 15.5 is the intrinsic, and we have to add the extinction to get the observed. Hmm.\n\nThis is a potential confusion point. Let me see the problem again. The problem says, for Star3: \"apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1.\"\n\nAh, wait, maybe the 15.5 is the apparent magnitude as observed, so including the extinction. So if the star's actual brightness is m_true, then m_observed = m_true + A_V. So if the problem gives m_observed as 15.5, then m_true = 15.5 - A_V =15.5-1.86=13.64. But why would that matter? Because in the context of the problem, the question is about the apparent magnitude as observed. So perhaps I should take the given m as the observed, which includes extinction.",
          "text2": "Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me clarify. The problem says, \"apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us.

So if E(B-V) is 0.6, then A_V is 3.1 * 0.6 =1.86 mag.\n\nBut in the case of Star3, if the given apparent magnitude is 15.5, is that the observed (corrected) magnitude, or the intrinsic (before extinction) magnitude?",
