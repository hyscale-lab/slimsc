So the equivalence point is when 10 cm\u00b3 of NaOH is added.\n\nThe question asks about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. Let's handle each point one by one.\n\nFirst, the 25% titration. Since the equivalence point is at 10 cm\u00b3, 25% of that is 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH added. So how many moles of NaOH have been added? 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.\n\nSo in the solution, initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001, and moles of NaOH added are 0.00025. The reaction consumes 0.00025 moles of acetic acid and produces 0.00025 moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-).\n\nSo the moles of acetic acid left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.\n\nMoles of acetate ion formed: 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe total volume at this point is the original 40 cm\u00b3 plus the 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH, so 42.5 cm\u00b3 or 0.0425 L.\n\nSo the concentrations are:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M\n\nSince this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])\n\nThe pKa is given by the negative log of Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) \u2192 wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). So, pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been neutralized. So the buffer consists of some unreacted acetic acid and some acetate ions.\n\nLet me calculate the concentrations. The total volume at 25% titration would be the initial acid volume plus the added NaOH volume. Initial acid is 20 cm\u00b3, and we added 2.5 cm\u00b3, so total volume is 22.5 cm\u00b3 or 0.0225 liters.\n\nThe moles of acetic acid initially were 0.001.

So the equivalence point is when 10 cm\u00b3 of NaOH is added.\n\nThe question asks about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. Let's handle each point one by one.\n\nFirst, the 25% titration. Since the equivalence point is at 10 cm\u00b3, 25% of that is 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH added. So how many moles of NaOH have been added? 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.\n\nSo in the solution, initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001, and moles of NaOH added are 0.00025. The reaction consumes 0.00025 moles of acetic acid and produces 0.00025 moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-).\n\nSo the moles of acetic acid left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.\n\nMoles of acetate ion formed: 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe total volume at this point is the original 40 cm\u00b3 plus the 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH, so 42.5 cm\u00b3 or 0.0425 L.\n\nSo the concentrations are:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M\n\nSince this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])\n\nThe pKa is given by the negative log of Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) \u2192 wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). So, pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733.

The total volume at 25% titration would be the initial acid volume plus the added NaOH volume.

          "text2": "Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol. The NaOH added is 10 cm\u00b3 of 0.1 M, which is 0.001 mol. So yes, all acetic acid is neutralized, producing 0.001 mol of acetate.\n\nThe total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 + 10 cm\u00b3 = 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L. So the concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M, correct.",

          "text1": "Wait, the pOH is negative log of [OH-].\n\nSo [OH-] =3.288e-6 \u2192 log(3.288e-6)=log(3.288) + log(1e-6)=0.5168 -6= -5.4832.\n\nSo pOH=5.4832.\n\npH=14-5.4832\u22488.5168 \u2192 approximately 8.52.\n\nSo that's where the 8.52 comes from. So the equivalence point pH is 8.52.\n\nAh! So I made a mistake earlier because I used the same x as before, but the exact solution gives a lower x, thus higher pH.\n\nSo the equivalence point pH is 8.52, which matches option A's second value.\n\nSo putting it all together: 25% titration pH is 4.26, equivalence pH is 8.52 \u2192 so option A is correct.",
          "text2": "Wait, sqrt(1e-11) is 1e-5.5 which is about 3.16e-6. But sqrt(1.081) is about 1.04. So 1.04 * 3.16e-6 is approximately 3.28e-6. So [OH^-]=3.28e-6. Then pOH is -log(3.28e-6). Let me compute this more accurately.\n\nLog(3.28) = 0.516. So 3.28e-6 has a log of 0.516 -6 = -5.484. So pOH is 5.484, pH is 8.516, which is ~8.52. So at equivalence, pH is about 8.52.\n\nSo putting it together, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.25, and at equivalence it's approximately 8.52. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52, which matches.",
