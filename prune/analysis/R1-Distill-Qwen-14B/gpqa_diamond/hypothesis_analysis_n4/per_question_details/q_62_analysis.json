Methyl chloride (CH3Cl) might be a methylating agent. H2 with a catalyst like Pd is hydrogenation. Ba(OH)2 is for elimination, perhaps. H2SO4 and HgSO4 are for oxidation, like the Jones oxidation. O3 is ozone, which is used in ozonolysis. NH4OH is ammonium hydroxide, which might be used in workups, like after ozonolysis.\n\nSo let's think about the steps needed.\n\nThe starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane with a -C\u2261CH group). I need to get to a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde and a substituent that's cyclohexyl-CH2-OH attached.",
