Let's think about the structure.\n\nIf 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules, perhaps via a double elimination, leading to a carbonyl. But how? Each elimination would form a double bond, but perhaps in this structure, the two adjacent carbons each lose Br and H, leading to a conjugated diene. But that wouldn't form a ketone.",
