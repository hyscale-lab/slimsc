Each fermion has an antiparticle counterpart, so the decay products would be something like f and f-bar.\n\nSo the possible decay channels are X \u2192 f f\u0304, where f is a fermion.\n\nBut which fermions are light enough that 2m_f \u2264 6 GeV?\n\nLet me think about the masses of the known fermions. The fermion masses I remember are:\n\nElectron (e): very light, about 0.0005 GeV.\n\nMuon (\u03bc): around 0.1 GeV.\n\nTau (\u03c4): around 1.78 GeV.\n\nQuarks: up, down are light. Up is like 2 MeV, down maybe 4-5 MeV. Then strange is around 100 MeV, charm around 1.5 GeV, bottom around 4.5 GeV, top is way heavier, around 173 GeV.\n\nSo let's list the possible fermions:\n\n1. Electron (e): mass ~0.0005 GeV. 2m_e \u2248 0.001 GeV << 6 GeV. So X can decay into e+ e-.\n\n2. Muon (\u03bc): 2m_mu \u2248 0.2 GeV, which is less than 6. So \u03bc+ \u03bc- is allowed.\n\n3. Tau (\u03c4): 2m_tau \u2248 3.56 GeV. 3.56 <6, so \u03c4+ \u03c4- is allowed.",
          "text2": "Oh wait, maybe it's something like -\u03bb f \\bar{\u03c8}_f (v + X) \u03c8_f. So, the boson X is interacting with fermions, specifically the fermion field \u03c8_f. So, X is a boson field, and the interaction term would likely be something that allows X to decay into fermion-antifermion pairs.\n\nSince X is a boson, its decay products would be fermions. So, X can decay into pairs of particles and their antiparticles. The possible decay products depend on the mass of X and the masses of the possible fermions.\n\nThe mass of X is 6 GeV. So, any fermion pair that can result from the decay must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because in particle physics, the rest mass energy must be less than the mass of the parent particle to allow the decay.\n\nFirst, I should list out the possible fermions and their masses. Let me remember the masses of the quarks and leptons:\n\n- Up and down quarks are the lightest. Their masses are about a few MeV. So, up (u) is around 2-5 MeV, down (d) similar. So, u and d quarks are definitely light enough because 6 GeV is way higher.\n- Strange (s) quark is about 100 MeV. Still way below 6 GeV.\n- Charm (c) quark is around 1.5 GeV. So a pair of c quarks would be about 3 GeV each, so 3 GeV each, so 3 * 2 = 6 GeV. So, X can decay into c c-bar if the mass is exactly 6 GeV.",
