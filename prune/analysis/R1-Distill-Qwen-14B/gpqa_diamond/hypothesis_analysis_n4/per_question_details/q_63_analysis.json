So that would be the first excited state, which could involve either a change in vibration or rotation. Which transition has lower energy?\n\nThe vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w v, where v is the vibrational quantum number. The ground state is v=0, so the first excited state (v=1) would require \u0394E = h w.\n\nThe rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1). The ground state is J=0, so the first excited rotational state is J=1, which would require \u0394E = B (1*(1+1)) - B (0*(0+1)) ) = 2 B.\n\nSo whether the photon causes a vibrational transition or a rotational transition depends on which requires less energy. So if h w is less than 2 B, then the vibrational transition is lower in energy and would be the next state.

So which transition is smaller in energy\u2014the first rotational (J=0 \u2192 J=1) or the first vibrational (v=0 \u2192 v=1)?\n\nLet me compute both energy differences.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the vibrational energy change. The energy for vibration is E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w v. So the difference between v=0 and v=1 is \u0394E_vib = h w (1 - 0) = h w. That's because the ground state is v=0, and the first excited vibrational state is v=1, so the energy difference is h w.\n\nNext, the rotational energy change. For rotation, the energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1). So from J=0 to J=1, the change is E_rot = B (1)(2) - B(0)(1) = 2 B. The energy difference is 2 B.\n\nSo which is smaller: 2 B or h w?\n\nI need to compute B first.
