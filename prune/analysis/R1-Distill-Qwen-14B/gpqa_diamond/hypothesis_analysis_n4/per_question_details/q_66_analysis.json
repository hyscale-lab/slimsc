So the operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry, unless the SM requires it. So for the question, which says, \"must be respected by all operators,\" that would mean that the operators are required to respect those symmetries. So if the SM doesn't require a symmetry, the operators don't have to.\n\nSo for option 3, CP symmetry: the operators in SMEFT are not required to respect CP. Because the SM itself doesn't have CP as a symmetry in all cases. So answer 3 is not a must.\n\nWhat about CPT symmetry? I remember that all Lorentz-invariant theories must respect CPT symmetry. Because CPT is a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. And in any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, CPT symmetry must hold. So if the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (option 1), then they must also respect CPT symmetry (option 4). So option 4 is correct.\n\nSo putting it all together, which symmetries must all operators respect?\n\n1. Lorentz Symmetry - yes.\n2. Poincare symmetry - yes, because it's a superset of Lorentz and includes translations, which the SM respects.\n3. CP symmetry - no, because SM doesn't require it.\n4. CPT symmetry - yes, because Lorentz implies CPT.",

But do they have to be CP invariant?\n\nNo, because the SM already has CP violation, so SMEFT can include operators that violate CP. So operators might not respect CP symmetry. So 3 is not a must.\n\nSo the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C: 1,2,4 \u2192 That's Lorentz, Poincare, CPT.\n\nOption D: 1,3,4 \u2192 No, since 3 is not a must.",
          "text2": "But wait, the SMEFT operators are constructed in a way that respects Poincare symmetry. So I think all operators must respect Poincare symmetry as well. So option 2 is also correct.\n\nNow, CP symmetry. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I remember that CP symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). But does SMEFT require all operators to be CP-symmetric? I think that's not necessarily the case. SMEFT allows for operators that break CP symmetry, especially because the Standard Model itself doesn't have a CP symmetry (except for some sectors, but generally, the SM doesn't enforce CP conservation everywhere). So operators in SMEFT can violate CP. Therefore, CP symmetry doesn't have to be respected by all operators. So option 3 is incorrect.\n\nWhat about CPT symmetry? I recall that in quantum field theory, CPT is a fundamental symmetry. Noether's theorem and the structure of QFT require that CPT symmetry holds. So operators in any QFT must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is correct.\n\nPutting it together: Symmetries 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT) must be respected.",
