But in this case, n(r) must be such that the integral of n(r) * 4\u03c0 r\u00b2 dr from 0 to R gives N = k R^5.\n\nSo, let's compute n(r):\n\nN = \u222b0^R n(r) 4 \u03c0 r\u00b2 dr = k R^5.\n\nLet me find n(r) such that this holds. Assume n(r) = A r^m.\n\nThen \u222b0^R A r^m * 4 \u03c0 r\u00b2 dr = 4 \u03c0 A \u222b0^R r^{m+2} dr = 4 \u03c0 A [ R^{m+3}/(m+3) ) ].\n\nSet this equal to k R^5 \u2192 4 \u03c0 A R^{m+3}/(m+3) = k R^5.\n\nSo for this to hold for any R, the exponents must match: m +3 =5 \u2192 m=2. Also, 4 \u03c0 A/(m+3) ) = k \u2192 4 \u03c0 A /5 =k \u2192 A=5k/(4\u03c0).\n\nSo n(r) = (5k/(4 \u03c0)) * r^2. So the number density increases as r^2.\n\nBut the question is about how the number of stars in that region changes with distance per unit range.

But in this case, n(r) must be such that the integral of n(r) * 4\u03c0 r\u00b2 dr from 0 to R gives N = k R^5.\n\nSo, let's compute n(r):\n\nN = \u222b0^R n(r) 4 \u03c0 r\u00b2 dr = k R^5.\n\nLet me find n(r) such that this holds.

So for a given distance d, the number of stars is proportional to d^5. So as you move to a larger d, more stars. So if you consider the change in N as you move from d to d+dr, the number of stars increases by 5d^4 dr, roughly. But the question is per unit distance, so perhaps it's the derivative, which is 5d^4. But that's not an option, and the options are about how N scales with r, not the rate of change.",
