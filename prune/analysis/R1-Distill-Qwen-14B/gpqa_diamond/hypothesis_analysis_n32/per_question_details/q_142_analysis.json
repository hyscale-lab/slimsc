Because \u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]].\n\nOur given \u03c1 is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So let's set the two equal:\n\n(1/2) * [ [1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y ], [r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z ] ] = [ [0.5, 0], [0, 0.5] ]\n\nSo each component must be equal. Let's write down the equations:\n\n(1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5 \u2192 1 + r_z = 1 \u2192 r_z = 0.\n\nThen, the off-diagonal terms: (r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0, and (r_x + i r_y)/2 = 0.",
