But does the rest fit?\n\nBut then, the product of a keto acid with X would have 2 oxygen atoms. Say, acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacting with Na2CO3 would produce CO2 and sodium acetate. Sodium acetate is CH3COONa, which has two O's in the COO- group. So perhaps that's the product. So yes, it has 2 O atoms.\n\nSo that fits. Also, X (Na2CO3) is a reagent in organic chemistry, often used in reactions like saponification.",

For example, if Y is a solution of CuSO4, then Na2CO3 would react to produce CuCO3, which is insoluble and would precipitate. So G would be CuCO3. Then, heating G would decompose it. CuCO3 upon heating would produce CuO, CO2, and H2O. So B would be CuO. The melting point of CuO is around 1400\u00b0C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe X isn't a carbonate.\n\nLet me think about the options again. The sum for option C is 31, which is 15 (N) +16 (O). So X must contain N and O. So perhaps X is something like nitric acid (HNO3). But then, when HNO3 reacts with something, what happens?\n\nHNO3 is a strong acid. Reacting it with a metal would produce NO3^- and the metal nitrate.
