Luminosity is the intrinsic brightness\u2014the total energy emitted per second. But when we observe a star, the flux (apparent brightness) depends on distance and luminosity.

So perhaps the 700 km/s is irrelevant for calculating the luminosity here. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem states that they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So the question is about the ratio L1/L2. Since they're both black bodies, I can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4\u03c0 R\u00b2 \u03c3 T^4.

Let me take it step by step.\n\nIf Star_2 is moving away, then its observed \u03bb_max is longer than Star_2's rest frame.

What about the radial velocities? The velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. How would that affect luminosity?\n\nHmm. Oh, wait. Luminosity is the intrinsic brightness\u2014the total energy emitted per second. But when we observe a star, the flux (apparent brightness) depends on distance and luminosity. But in this case, the problem says they computed the luminosity using the blackbody formula, so perhaps the radial velocity doesn't directly affect L. Or does it?",
          "text2": "Wait, but the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosities assuming the stars radiate as black bodies. So I think the radial velocities might not directly affect the calculation of luminosity because the luminosity is an intrinsic property (what the star actually emits), not the observed flux. Oh, but wait, the observed flux depends on distance and velocity, but the problem is about the actual luminosity, not observed flux. So perhaps the 700 km/s is irrelevant for calculating the luminosity here. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem states that they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So the question is about the ratio L1/L2. Since they're both black bodies, I can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4\u03c0 R\u00b2 \u03c3 T^4. So L is proportional to R\u00b2 T^4.\n\nWe know R1 is 1.5 R2, and T1 equals T2 because the peak wavelengths are the same. So substituting, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.\n\nSince R1=1.5 R2 and T1=T2, the ratio is (1.5)^2 * (1)^4 = 2.25. So the luminosity of Star_1 should be 2.25 times that of Star_2. Looking at the options, option A is ~2.25. So that should be the answer.",

So T1 < T2.\n\nSo, now, the luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (R1\u00b2 T1\u2074) / (R2\u00b2 T2\u2074). Since R1 = 1.5 R2, that's ( (1.5 R2)^2 ) / (R2^2 ) ) = (2.25 R2\u00b2) / R2\u00b2 = 2.25.\n\nSo, L1/L2 = 2.25 * (T1^4 / T2^4).\n\nBut T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c). So, T1 = T2 * [1/(1 + 0.002333)].\n\nSo, T1^4 = T2^4 * [1/(1.002333)]^4.\n\nSo, [T1/T2]^4 = [1/(1.002333)]^4.\n\nSo, L1/L2 = 2.25 * [1/(1.002333)]^4.\n\nWhat's 1.002333^4? Let's approximate.\n\nFirst, 1.002333 is approximately 1.00233. Let me compute the natural logarithm: ln(1.00233) \u2248 0.002327 (since ln(1+x) \u2248 x for small x).\n\nSo, ln(1.00233)^4 \u2248 4 * 0.002327 = 0.009308.\n\nThen, e^0.009308 \u2248 1.00936.\n\nSo, 1.00233^4 \u2248 1.00936.\n\nSo, 1/(1.00233)^4 \u2248 1/1.00936 \u2248 0.9907.\n\nSo, L1/L2 \u2248 2.25 * 0.9907 \u2248 2.2278.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is ~2.23. Option C is ~2.35, which is higher. So the correct answer would be D.",
