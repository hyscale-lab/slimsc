So probably, it's the total energy because in particle physics, when they give energy for colliders, it's often the total energy (rest mass plus kinetic). But I'm a bit unsure. Let me think.\n\nThe formula for total energy in relativity is E = gamma * m0 c\u00b2. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So I can calculate gamma first.\n\nLet me calculate gamma when v = 0.96c. So v is 0.96c, so v\u00b2 = (0.96)^2 c\u00b2. So in the denominator, 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - (0.96)^2. Let me compute that. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.",

Let me read it again: \"What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?\"\n\nSo the question is about the energy the collider imparts to the nucleus, which would be the kinetic energy. Because the rest mass energy is already there, and the collider adds energy to accelerate it.\n\nOh, right! So I think I've made a mistake. I calculated the total energy (gamma m c\u00b2), but perhaps the problem is asking for the kinetic energy, which is (gamma -1) m c\u00b2.\n\nSo let's recalculate. Kinetic energy K = (gamma -1) m c\u00b2.\n\nSo K = (3.57142857 -1) * 9.9898545e-27 kg *9e16 m\u00b2/s\u00b2.\n\nCompute gamma -1: 2.57142857.\n\nSo K =2.57142857 *9.9898545e-27 *9e16.\n\nCompute 9.9898545e-27 *9e16 =8.99086905e-10 J.\n\nThen multiply by 2.57142857: 2.57142857 *8.99086905e-10.\n\nCompute 2 *8.99086905e-10 =17.9817381e-10.\n\n0.57142857 *8.99086905e-10 \u22485.13763945e-10.\n\nAdding them: 17.9817381e-10 +5.13763945e-10 =23.11937755e-10 J.\n\nNow, convert to GeV: 23.11937755e-10 J /1.602176634e-10 J/GeV \u2248 14.43 GeV.\n\nHmm, that's 14.43 GeV, but that's not one of the options. So perhaps the initial assumption was incorrect, and the problem is referring to the total energy (gamma m c\u00b2), which is 32.11e-10 J, which is approximately 20.034 GeV.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is 20.132 GeV (option C).
