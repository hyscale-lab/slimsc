Because in the dissociation, the K is actually Kd = 1/Kf. \n\nSo, the dissociation reaction is Ca-EDTA \u21cc Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4-, and its Kd = 1/(Kf) = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. \n\nSo, the correct K for the dissociation is 2e-11.

Let me write it as:\n\nx\u00b2 + (5e10)x - (1e9) = 0\n\nWe can use the quadratic formula: x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 +4ac) ]/(2a)\n\nHere, a=1, b=5e10, c=-1e9.\n\nDiscriminant, D = (5e10)^2 +4*(1)*(1e9) = 25e20 +4e9 \u2248 25e20, since 4e9 is negligible compared to 25e20.\n\nSo sqrt(D) \u22485e10.\n\nSo x \u2248 [ -5e10 \u00b15e10 ]/(2)\n\nTaking the positive root:\n\nx\u2248 [ (-5e10 +5e10) ]/(2) = 0/2 = 0",

So this suggests that the assumption that x is much smaller than 0.02 is wrong. That can't be right. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think. The formation constant Kf is given as 5e10. The complex is Ca-EDTA, so when it dissociates, it releases Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, initially, [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02, [Ca\u00b2+] = 0, [EDTA]=0. As it dissociates, let's say the change is x. So at equilibrium, [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x, [Ca\u00b2+] = x, [EDTA] = x. \n\nThe K expression is Kf = (x)(x)/(0.02 - x) \u2248 (x\u00b2)/(0.02) if x is small. But if x is not small, then I can't neglect x in the denominator. So perhaps x isn't negligible. So I can't make that approximation.",
