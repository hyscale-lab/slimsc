CP symmetry: CP is charge conjugation and parity. The SM doesn't respect CP symmetry in general. For example, CP violation is present in the CKM matrix. So in SMEFT, operators can violate CP, as long as they are consistent with the SM's CP properties. So not all operators must respect CP; some may violate it. So 3 is not required to be respected by all operators.\n\n4. CPT symmetry: The CPT theorem says that any Lorentz-invariant QFT must be CPT-symmetric. So since SMEFT is a QFT that's Lorentz-invariant, all operators must respect CPT symmetry. So 4 is correct.\n\nSo now, which options are correct: 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincar\u00e9), 4 (CPT).",
          "text2": "Wait, but do the SMEFT operators have to respect CP? Or is it possible for them to have operators that break CP? I think the SMEFT itself doesn't enforce CP symmetry. It's a framework that allows for any possible operators, provided they have the correct Lorentz structure. So operators could violate CP. But the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if some operators violate CP, then CP symmetry (3) isn't a must, so it's not a required symmetry for all operators. So option 3 isn't a required symmetry.\n\nFinally, CPT symmetry (4). CPT is a big one in quantum field theory. I think CPT symmetry is required in any Lorentz-invariant theory. Because Lorentz symmetry implies CPT symmetry. So any operator that respects Lorentz symmetry must also respect CPT. So in SMEFT, since all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry, they must also respect CPT. So option 4 is a must.\n\nSo to recap, which symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect? Lorentz (1) and CPT (4) must be respected. What about Poincare (2)? Poincare includes Lorentz plus translations. Since SMEFT is an effective theory, it's built as a Lorentz-invariant theory, which necessarily includes Poincare because it's a subset.

          "text1": "Wait, but wait a minute. SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the SM plus higher-dimensional operators. The SM respects Poincar\u00e9 symmetry, so the effective theory should too. Because the SM is a Poincar\u00e9-invariant theory, and the SMEFT is an extension of it. So all operators must respect Lorentz and Poincar\u00e9 symmetries. So 1 and 2 are both correct.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that Poincar\u00e9 is automatically respected if Lorentz is, but that's not exactly right. Poincar\u00e9 includes translations, so if the theory respects translations, then yes. SMEFT does respect translations because it's a local theory\u2014so the operators are local, so Poincar\u00e9 must be respected.\n\nSo 1 and 2 are correct.\n\nNow, about CP symmetry. As I thought earlier, SMEFT allows for operators that break CP, so not all operators have to respect it. So 3 is not a must.\n\nCPT symmetry (4) must be respected because any quantum field theory must respect CPT. So 4 is a must.",
          "text2": "Wait, but wait another thought. The SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. Therefore, they must be Lorentz-invariant. But Poincare includes not just Lorentz but also spacetime translations. So if an operator is Lorentz-invariant, does it automatically imply it's Poincare-invariant? Because the operators are part of a local theory, they should respect all the symmetries of the underlying theory, including translations. So I think operators in SMEFT respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries, so options 1 and 2 are both correct.\n\nNext, CP symmetry (3). I'm not as sure about this. The Standard Model isn't CP-symmetric, right? Because of things like the CKM phase, leading to CP violation. So, in the SMEFT, operators can actually include terms that violate CP. For example, higher-dimensional operators can involve CP-odd terms. So not all operators must respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not necessarily required. So 3 is out.\n\nWhat about CPT symmetry (4)? CPT symmetry is a big deal in quantum field theory. I think all renormalizable theories must respect CPT symmetry, but wait, SMEFT is an effective theory. Do all effective theories respect CPT? Well, I think CPT is a fundamental symmetry that must be respected by any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory. Because the presence of Lorentz symmetry leads to the requirement of CPT symmetry. So in SMEFT, which respects Lorentz symmetry, all operators must also respect CPT. So 4 must be correct.\n\nSo putting it all together: the symmetries that must be respected by all SMEFT operators are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4).",
