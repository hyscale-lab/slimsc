But in a rhombohedral structure with angles different from 90 degrees, the interatomic distance between adjacent atoms (along the edge) is a, because each edge has an atom at each corner. So yes, in that case, a = 10 angstroms.\n\nSo we're to find the interplanar distance for (111) plane. So h =1, k=1, l=1.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nd\u00b2 = a\u00b2 / [ (1\u00b2 +1\u00b2 +1\u00b2) - (1*1 + 1*1 +1*1)(1 + cos \u03b1) ) ]\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\nDenominator = 3 - [3*(1 + cos 30\u00b0)] \n\nBecause 1*1 +1*1 +1*1 is 3, and each term is multiplied by (1 + cos \u03b1).\n\nSo cos 30 degrees is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.8660.\n\nSo 1 + cos 30 = 1 + 0.8660 = 1.8660.\n\nSo denominator becomes 3 - 3*1.8660 = 3 - 5.598 = -2.598.",
