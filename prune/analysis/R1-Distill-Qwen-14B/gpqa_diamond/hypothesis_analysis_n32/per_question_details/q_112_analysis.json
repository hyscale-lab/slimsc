Let's compute the normalization factor first because the state is only given up to a proportionality constant.\n\nThe vector in the |up> and |down> basis is [1+i, 2-i]. The normalization factor is the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each component. So the norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.\n\n|2 - i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.\n\nSo the total norm squared is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, the state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> multiplied by 1/sqrt(7).\n\nSo |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down> .\n\nNow, I need to write this state in terms of the eigenstates of the operator A. Let me denote |+> and |-> as the eigenstates of A (eigenvalues +hbar/2 and -hbar/2 respectively). So,\n\n|+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),\n|-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).\n\nWe can express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+> and |->.\n\nSo let's write |alpha> = c_+ |+> + c_- |->.\n\nExpressing |+> and |-> in terms of |up> and |down>:\n\nc_+ = < + | alpha >,\nc_- = < - | alpha >.\n\nLet me compute c_+ and c_-.\n\nFirst, compute c_+.\n\n< + | alpha > = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]\n\nSo this is (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (1+i) <down|up> + (2 -i) <up|down> + (2 -i) <down|down> ].",
