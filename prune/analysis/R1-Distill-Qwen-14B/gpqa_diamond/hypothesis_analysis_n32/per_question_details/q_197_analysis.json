Or perhaps an ester.\n\nLooking at the NMR data:\n\nThe 1H NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet integrating for 1H. That seems like a carboxylic acid proton. Because aldehydic protons are usually around 9-10, but they are usually deshielded and appear as a singlet.

So if compound X is a benzoic acid, the -COOH would have a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. So that 10.5 ppm peak is probably an -OH from a carboxylic acid.\n\nThen, looking at the aromatic region: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because two doublets with 2H each, para substitution. So, for example, if the substituents are at the para positions, each set of protons would be a doublet, each integrating for 2H. So that's a benzene ring with substituents at the 1 and 4 positions, maybe.\n\nNext, the NMR signals in the lower ppm regions. There's a 2.9 ppm multiplet (m, 1H), then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Hmm. The 0.9 ppm triplet likely comes from a methyl group attached to a CH2, like a CH2CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm doublet for 3H suggests a CH(CH3) group or something similar. The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) could be a CH2 next to another CH or something. The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) is a bit tricky\u2014maybe a methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl, like CH attached to CO.\n\nPutting this together, maybe the structure is something like a benzene ring with a substituent that's a carbonyl group (from the IR) and an ethyl or isobutyl group attached.",
