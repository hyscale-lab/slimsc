So the brightness change is that 5.177% dip.\n\nBut for the exoplanet case, the dip is when the planet transits the star. The dip is (Area_planet / Area_star) * 1, because the planet blocks the star's light, which is at Teff. So the dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2.\n\nWe need to find R_planet such that (R_p / R_s )^2 = \u0394F/F = 0.05177.\n\nSo R_p / R_s = sqrt(0.05177) \u2248 sqrt(0.05) is about 0.2236. Let me compute sqrt(0.05177).\n\nHm, 0.05177 is approximately 5.177% of 1. So what's the square root of 0.05177?\n\nWell, 0.05 is 0.2236^2. Let me compute 0.05177:\n\nWe can approximate. Let's say x = 0.05177.\n\nx \u2248 0.05177.\n\nWe know that 0.228^2 = 0.051984, which is a bit higher than 0.05177.\n\n0.227^2 = 0.051529.\n\nSo 0.227^2 is 0.051529, 0.228^2 is ~0.051984.\n\nOur x is 0.05177, which is between 0.051529 and 0.051984.\n\nDifference between 0.05177 and 0.051529 is 0.000241. The total between 0.227 and 0.228 is 0.000455 (0.051984-0.051529=0.000455).\n\nSo 0.000241 / 0.000455 \u2248 0.53. So x is about 0.227 + 0.53*(0.001) \u2248 0.22753.\n\nSo approximately 0.2275 or 0.228. So R_planet / R_star is about 0.2275.",

So the brightness change is that 5.177% dip.\n\nBut for the exoplanet case, the dip is when the planet transits the star. The dip is (Area_planet / Area_star) * 1, because the planet blocks the star's light, which is at Teff. So the dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2.\n\nWe need to find R_planet such that (R_p / R_s )^2 = \u0394F/F = 0.05177.\n\nSo R_p / R_s = sqrt(0.05177) \u2248 sqrt(0.05) is about 0.2236. Let me compute sqrt(0.05177).\n\nHm, 0.05177 is approximately 5.177% of 1. So what's the square root of 0.05177?\n\nWell, 0.05 is 0.2236^2. Let me compute 0.05177:\n\nWe can approximate. Let's say x = 0.05177.\n\nx \u2248 0.05177.\n\nWe know that 0.228^2 = 0.051984, which is a bit higher than 0.05177.\n\n0.227^2 = 0.051529.\n\nSo 0.227^2 is 0.051529, 0.228^2 is ~0.051984.\n\nOur x is 0.05177, which is between 0.051529 and 0.051984.\n\nDifference between 0.05177 and 0.051529 is 0.000241. The total between 0.227 and 0.228 is 0.000455 (0.051984-0.051529=0.000455).\n\nSo 0.000241 / 0.000455 \u2248 0.53. So x is about 0.227 + 0.53*(0.001) \u2248 0.22753.\n\nSo approximately 0.2275 or 0.228. So R_planet / R_star is about 0.2275.",

Let me think about this differently.\n\nThe star's unspotted flux is F0 = sigma Teff^4 * 4 pi R^2 / (4 pi D^2 ) ) = sigma Teff^4 R^2 / D^2.\n\nWhen the spot hemisphere is visible, the flux is F = ( (1-f) * Teff^4 + f * (Teff - delta_T)^4 ) * (2 pi R^2) sigma / (4 pi D^2 )\n\nSo,\n\nF = [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] * (sigma R^2 )/(2 D^2 )\n\nSo F = F0 * [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ) ] / (2 Teff^4 )\n\nBecause F0 is sigma Teff^4 R^2 / D^2.\n\nSo,\n\nF / F0 = [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] / (2 Teff^4 )\n\n= [ (1-f) + f ( (Teff - delta_T)^4 ) / Teff^4 ] / 2\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo F/F0 \u2248 0.448, so amplitude is 0.552, which is a 55% dip.\n\nBut that's impossible for a planet, which can't have such a large radius. So I must have made a mistake in the model.",
