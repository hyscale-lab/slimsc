So if I have a change in parallax d plx, how does that relate to the change in distance?\n\nLet me express d in terms of plx. d = 1/plx. So, if plx increases by d plx, then d changes by -d plx\u00b2. Because differentiating d with respect to plx gives dd/d plx = -1/(plx)^2. So a small change in plx, d plx, corresponds to a change in distance of dd = -(1/plx\u00b2) d plx.\n\nSo the volume between d and d + dd is the surface area of the sphere at radius d multiplied by the thin shell thickness dd. The surface area is 4\u03c0d\u00b2. So the volume element is 4\u03c0d\u00b2 dd.\n\nSubstituting d = 1/plx and dd = -(1/plx\u00b2) d plx, the volume becomes 4\u03c0 (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx^2 d plx).",

But since p decreases as d increases, maybe I should be careful with the limits, but maybe for small intervals, the negative sign just indicates direction, but since we're dealing with magnitude, perhaps I can ignore it for now.\n\nSo substituting d into the expression for N: N = density * 4\u03c0 (1/p\u00b2)\u00b2 * (-1/p\u00b2 dp) \u2192",

Let's think about that.\n\nSince the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a volume element depends on the volume. But in terms of parallax, how does the volume change with parallax? Let's model this.\n\nThe distance d is 1/plx. So, if parallax changes by dplx, what's the change in distance, dd? Let's see: plx = 1/d, so dplx = - (1/d^2) dd. Hmm, that might come in handy. Let me think about it in terms of differentials.\n\nSo, dplx = - (1/d\u00b2) dd \u2192 dd = -d\u00b2 dplx. But since d is a positive quantity and dplx is a small positive change, perhaps I should take absolute values. So, the change in distance is proportional to d squared times the change in parallax.",

Oh, right, so the change in distance is inversely related to the square of the parallax times the change in parallax.\n\nBut I'm interested in the number of stars in a small range of plx. So, for a given plx, the corresponding distance is d = 1/plx. The volume element in spherical coordinates is 4\u03c0d\u00b2 dd. Since the number of stars is density times volume, and the density is uniform, let's say n (number per volume). So, number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd is N = n * 4\u03c0 d\u00b2 dd.\n\nBut I need to express this in terms of plx. So, substituting d = 1/plx, and dd in terms of dplx.

So I need to relate the number of stars in a range of parallax (dplx) to plx.\n\nLet me rephrase. For a given parallax range dplx, what's the change in the number of stars? Since plx = 1/d, the distance d corresponding to plx is d = 1/plx.\n\nSo a change in plx (dplx) corresponds to a change in d. Let's find the corresponding range in distance. If plx changes by dplx, then d changes by dd = (d\u00b2) dplx. Because plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Taking derivative: dd = (-1/plx\u00b2) dplx \u2192 dplx = - (plx\u00b2) dd.

The number would be N = n * 4\u03c0d\u00b2 dr, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume), and dr is the thickness of the shell.\n\nBut we need this number in terms of a parallax range.
