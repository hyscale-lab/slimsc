Let me compute the molecular weights of each option:\n\n   Option A: C6H12O2. The formula is C6H12O2. Molecular weight would be (6\u00d712)+(12\u00d71)+(2\u00d716)=72+12+32=116 g/mol.\n\n   Option B: C6H10O. (6\u00d712)+(10\u00d71)+(16)=72+10+16=98.\n\n   Option C: C6H10O2. (6\u00d712)+(10\u00d71)+(32)=72+10+32=114.\n\n   Option D: C6H12O. (6\u00d712)+(12\u00d71)+(16)=72+12+16=100.",

So one degree, same as A.\n\nBut the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so at least one double bond. So A and D have one degree (could be a double bond or a ring), B and C have two degrees.

The molecular formula is either of these options.\n\nOption A: C6H12O2.
