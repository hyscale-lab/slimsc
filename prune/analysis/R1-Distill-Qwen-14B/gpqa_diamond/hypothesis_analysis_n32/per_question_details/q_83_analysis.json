          "text1": "Wait, but the question mentions 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume. 25% of 10 cm\u00b3 is 2.5 cm\u00b3. So at 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH added, that's the 25% point.\n\nSo let's tackle each part: pH at 25% titration and pH at equivalence point.\n\nStarting with the 25% point.\n\nAt this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized. The reaction is 1:1, so 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH would add 0.1 * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol of NaOH. So moles reacted: 0.00025 mol. Since the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001, the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The NaOH converts some of the acetic acid to acetate ions. So moles of acetate formed are 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe total volume at this point is the original 40 cm\u00b3 plus the 2.5 cm\u00b3 NaOH. So 42.5 cm\u00b3 = 0.0425 L.\n\nSo the concentrations are: [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425, and [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425.\n\nLet me compute these. \n\n0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L = 0.017647 M (approx)\n0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L = 0.005882 M (approx)\n\nSo the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).\n\nThe pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. \n\nLog(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.\n\nSo pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

That should be correct.\n\nSo for the 25% titration point, we can model the solution as a buffer solution, since some of the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO^-). So, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nFirst, let's find the concentrations of acetic acid and acetate at 25% titration.\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.001 mol. Adding 0.00025 mol of NaOH will react with acetic acid:\n\nCH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.\n\nSo, moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.\n\nMoles of CH3COO^- produced: 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe total volume is the initial volume plus the NaOH added. Initial volume after dilution was 40 cm\u00b3 (0.04 L). Adding 2.5 cm\u00b3 (0.0025 L) of NaOH solution: total volume is 0.0425 L.\n\nSo, concentrations:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M.\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M.\n\nNow, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).\n\nKa of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(1) - log(1.85e-5) \u2192 approx 4.74 (since log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5-0.267=4.733). So pKa \u2248 4.74.\n\nSo plugging into H-H:\n\npH = 4.74 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)\n\nCalculate the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 \u2248 0.333.\n\nLog(0.333) is about -0.477.\n\nSo pH \u2248 4.74 - 0.477 = 4.263. Which is approximately 4.26.\n\nSo the pH at 25% is about 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value, but let me see the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA) 4.26; 8.52\n\nB) 3.17; 6.73\n\nC)4.73;7.00\n\nD)4.57;6.92\n\nSo the first value matches option A. But what about the equivalence point?\n\nAt equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution.\n\nThe concentration of acetate (CH3COO^-) can be calculated. At equivalence, moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, and the total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 + 10 cm\u00b3 = 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L.\n\nSo [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nThe acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for acetate can be calculated from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5.\n\nSo Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nThe concentration is 0.02 M. Using the approximation for weak bases, [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * c).\n\nSo sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5 M.\n\npOH = -log(1.04e-5) \u2248 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 \u22489.02.",

The total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 (original solution) + 10 cm\u00b3 (equivalence volume) = 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L.\n\nSo concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nThe acetate ion will hydrolyze in water:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for acetate can be calculated from Ka of acetic acid. Since Kw = Ka * Kb, so Kb = Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5.\n\nSo Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nThe acetate concentration is 0.02 M. We can set up the expression for Kb:\n\nKb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]\n\nAssuming x is the [OH^-], which will be small because Kb is small.\n\nSo:\n\nx^2 / (0.02 - x) \u2248 x^2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10.\n\nSo x^2 \u2248 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.\n\nx \u2248 sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] is about 1.04e-5 M.

The initial diluted solution is 0.025 M, not 0.0125. Hmm, okay, that's an important step. So the initial concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\nNow, when we titrate this with NaOH. Let's think about the stoichiometry. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COONa + H2O.\n\nThe equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equals the moles of acetic acid. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed for equivalence is (moles) / (concentration) = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm\u00b3.\n\nThe question asks about 25% titration. So that's 25% of the equivalence volume. 25% of 10 cm\u00b3 is 2.5 cm\u00b3. So at this point, 0.25 \u00d7 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol of NaOH has been added. So moles of NaOH added = 0.00025 mol.\n\nAt this point, let's calculate the pH. Since 25% of the acid has been neutralized, there's 75% of the acetic acid left, and 25% has been converted to acetate ions.\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol. After adding 0.00025 mol NaOH, the moles of CH3COOH left is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed is 0.00025 mol.\n\nSo the solution is a buffer solution of acetic acid and acetate ions. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).\n\nThe pKa of acetic acid is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. 1.85e-5 is 1.85 \u00d710^-5.

So pH = 4.735 + (-0.477) \u2248 4.258, which rounds to about 4.26. Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first pH value.\n\nNow, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to form the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) in solution. The solution now contains this conjugate base, which will hydrolyze in water to form OH^- ions, making the solution basic.\n\nThe moles of acetate ion at equivalence are 0.001 mol. The total volume is the initial volume (40 cm\u00b3) plus the equivalence point volume (10 cm\u00b3), so 50 cm\u00b3 or 0.05 L.\n\nSo the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nSo Kb is 5.405e-10.

Option A's first value is 4.26, so that's very close.\n\nNow, what about the equivalence point?\n\nAt equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So the solution is sodium acetate in water. Since sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid and strong base, the solution will be basic. So it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.\n\nThe steps to find pH at equivalence:\n\n1. Determine moles of sodium acetate at equivalence.\n\nAt equivalence, all 0.001 moles of acetic acid have reacted, producing 0.001 moles of acetate ions (CH3COO^-).\n\nThe total volume is the initial solution (40 cm\u00b3) plus the NaOH added (10 cm\u00b3), so 50 cm\u00b3 or 0.05 L.\n\nSo concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\n2. The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Since Kw is 1e-14 at 25\u00b0C.\n\nKb = 1e-14 / (1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10.\n\nSo Kb is 5.405e-10.\n\nThe concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So we can set up the expression.\n\nLet me denote [CH3COOH] = x, [OH^-] = x.\n\nSo Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) \u2248 x^2 / 0.02 since x will be very small compared to 0.02.\n\nSo x^2 \u2248 Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.\n\nx = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 3.288e-6 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] = 3.288e-6 M.\n\npOH = -log(3.288e-6) \u2248 let's compute this.\n\nlog(3.288e-6) = log(3.288) + log(1e-6) \u2248 0.5168 -6 = -5.4832. So pOH is 5.4832.\n\npH = 14 - pOH = 14 -5.4832 = 8.5168, approximately 8.52.\n\nSo the pH at equivalence is around 8.52.\n\nLooking at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52. Option D has 4.57 and 6.92. So option A seems to match both the 25% and equivalence points.",

Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH), so the solution will be basic.\n\nAt equivalence point, the moles of acetate ions are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid. So 0.001 mol of CH3COO^-.\n\nThe total volume is 40 mL (original solution) plus 10 mL (NaOH added) = 50 mL or 0.05 L.\n\nSo concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nNow, acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid. In solution, it will hydrolyze according to:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Since Ka is 1.85e-5, Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nThe concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let's set up the expression for Kb.\n\nLet x be the concentration of OH^- produced.\n\nKb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] \u2248 x\u00b2 / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02.\n\nSo x\u00b2 \u2248 Kb * 0.02 \u2192 x\u00b2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x \u2248 sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2192 approximately 3.288e-6 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] \u2248 3.288e-6 M. Then pOH = -log([OH^-]).\n\nlog(3.288e-6) is log(3.288) + log(1e-6). Log(3.288) is about 0.517, so pOH \u2248 5.483.\n\npH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 \u2248 8.517. So approximately 8.52.\n\nSo the second pH value is 8.52.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52 as the two pH values. So that should be the correct option.",

So, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nFirst, let's find the concentrations of acetic acid and acetate at 25% titration.\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.001 mol. Adding 0.00025 mol of NaOH will react with acetic acid:\n\nCH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.\n\nSo, moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.\n\nMoles of CH3COO^- produced: 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe total volume is the initial volume plus the NaOH added. Initial volume after dilution was 40 cm\u00b3 (0.04 L). Adding 2.5 cm\u00b3 (0.0025 L) of NaOH solution: total volume is 0.0425 L.\n\nSo, concentrations:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M.\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M.\n\nNow, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).\n\nKa of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(1) - log(1.85e-5) \u2192 approx 4.74 (since log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5-0.267=4.733).

Which is approximately 4.26.\n\nSo the pH at 25% is about 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value, but let me see the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA) 4.26; 8.52\n\nB) 3.17; 6.73\n\nC)4.73;7.00\n\nD)4.57;6.92\n\nSo the first value matches option A. But what about the equivalence point?\n\nAt equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution.\n\nThe concentration of acetate (CH3COO^-) can be calculated. At equivalence, moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, and the total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 + 10 cm\u00b3 = 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L.\n\nSo [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nThe acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for acetate can be calculated from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5.\n\nSo Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nThe concentration is 0.02 M. Using the approximation for weak bases, [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * c).\n\nSo sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5 M.\n\npOH = -log(1.04e-5) \u2248 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 \u22489.02.",

So the solution is sodium acetate in water. Since sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid and strong base, the solution will be basic. So it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.\n\nThe steps to find pH at equivalence:\n\n1. Determine moles of sodium acetate at equivalence.\n\nAt equivalence, all 0.001 moles of acetic acid have reacted, producing 0.001 moles of acetate ions (CH3COO^-).\n\nThe total volume is the initial solution (40 cm\u00b3) plus the NaOH added (10 cm\u00b3), so 50 cm\u00b3 or 0.05 L.\n\nSo concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\n2. The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Since Kw is 1e-14 at 25\u00b0C.\n\nKb = 1e-14 / (1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10.\n\nSo Kb is 5.405e-10.\n\nThe concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So we can set up the expression.\n\nLet me denote [CH3COOH] = x, [OH^-] = x.\n\nSo Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) \u2248 x^2 / 0.02 since x will be very small compared to 0.02.\n\nSo x^2 \u2248 Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.\n\nx = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 3.288e-6 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] = 3.288e-6 M.\n\npOH = -log(3.288e-6) \u2248 let's compute this.\n\nlog(3.288e-6) = log(3.288) + log(1e-6) \u2248 0.5168 -6 = -5.4832. So pOH is 5.4832.\n\npH = 14 - pOH = 14 -5.4832 = 8.5168, approximately 8.52.\n\nSo the pH at equivalence is around 8.52.\n\nLooking at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52.

So, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nFirst, let's find the concentrations of acetic acid and acetate at 25% titration.\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.001 mol. Adding 0.00025 mol of NaOH will react with acetic acid:\n\nCH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.\n\nSo, moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.\n\nMoles of CH3COO^- produced: 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe total volume is the initial volume plus the NaOH added. Initial volume after dilution was 40 cm\u00b3 (0.04 L). Adding 2.5 cm\u00b3 (0.0025 L) of NaOH solution: total volume is 0.0425 L.\n\nSo, concentrations:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M.\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M.\n\nNow, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).\n\nKa of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(1) - log(1.85e-5) \u2192 approx 4.74 (since log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5-0.267=4.733). So pKa \u2248 4.74.\n\nSo plugging into H-H:\n\npH = 4.74 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)\n\nCalculate the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 \u2248 0.333.\n\nLog(0.333) is about -0.477.\n\nSo pH \u2248 4.74 - 0.477 = 4.263. Which is approximately 4.26.\n\nSo the pH at 25% is about 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value, but let me see the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA) 4.26; 8.52\n\nB) 3.17; 6.73\n\nC)4.73;7.00\n\nD)4.57;6.92\n\nSo the first value matches option A. But what about the equivalence point?\n\nAt equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution.\n\nThe concentration of acetate (CH3COO^-) can be calculated. At equivalence, moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, and the total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 + 10 cm\u00b3 = 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L.\n\nSo [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nThe acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for acetate can be calculated from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5.\n\nSo Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nThe concentration is 0.02 M. Using the approximation for weak bases, [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * c).\n\nSo sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5 M.\n\npOH = -log(1.04e-5) \u2248 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 \u22489.02.",

The moles of acetate ion produced is 0.00025.\n\nThe total volume of the solution now is the initial 40 mL (diluted acetic acid) plus the 2.5 mL NaOH added.

Sodium acetate will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.\n\nSo, let's calculate the concentration of acetate ions at equivalence.\n\nTotal volume at equivalence: the initial solution is 40 cm\u00b3, and the NaOH volume can be calculated.\n\nMoles of NaOH needed for equivalence: same as moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 moles.\n\nMolarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume = moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm\u00b3. So total volume at equivalence is 40 + 10 = 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L.\n\nSo concentration of acetate (CH3COO^-) is 0.001 moles / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.\n\nNow, the hydrolysis reaction:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb is Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nSo Kb = 5.405e-10. The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.\n\nUsing the approximation for weak bases: [OH^-] \u2248 sqrt(Kb * C). So sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5.\n\npOH = -log(1.04e-5) \u2248 4.98, so pH = 14 - 4.98 \u2248 9.02.",
          "text2": "Wait, maybe it's better to find the equivalence point first. The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has been neutralized. So moles of NaOH at equivalence = moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 moles. \n\nThe volume of NaOH needed for equivalence would be moles / concentration. That's 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm\u00b3. \n\nSo 25% titration would be 25% of 10 cm\u00b3, which is 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH added. \n\nNow, back to the 25% titration point. At this point, some of the acetic acid has been converted into acetate ions. Let's model the solution. \n\nThe initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid. When we add 2.5 cm\u00b3 of 0.1 M NaOH, the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since the acetic acid is 0.001 moles, 0.00025 moles react, leaving 0.00075 moles of acetic acid unreacted, and creating 0.00025 moles of acetate. \n\nSo the situation is a buffer solution of acetic acid and acetate ions. To find the pH, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. \n\nThe equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). \n\nFirst, I need pKa. The Ka given is 1.85e-5. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me approximate that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 1.85e-5 is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa \u22484.733.",

So pKa \u2248 4.73.\n\nSo pH = 4.73 + log( (0.005882)/(0.017647) )\n\nLet me compute that ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 \u2248 0.3333. So log(0.333) is about -0.477.\n\nSo pH = 4.73 - 0.477 \u2248 4.253. Hmm, that's approximately 4.25. Looking at the options, option D is pH 4.57 and 6.92. Option A is 4.26... So that's close to 4.26.",

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate.

The volume is the total volume after adding all the NaOH, which is 40 cm\u00b3 +10 cm\u00b3=50 cm\u00b3 or 0.05 L.\n\nSo concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nSince acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions. So the solution will be basic, and we can calculate pH using the Kb.\n\nFirst, Kb = Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25\u00b0C.

So the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since the initial moles of acetic acid was 0.001, the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And the moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025 moles.",

The initial diluted solution is 0.025 M, not 0.0125. Hmm, okay, that's an important step. So the initial concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\nNow, when we titrate this with NaOH. Let's think about the stoichiometry. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COONa + H2O.\n\nThe equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equals the moles of acetic acid. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed for equivalence is (moles) / (concentration) = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm\u00b3.\n\nThe question asks about 25% titration. So that's 25% of the equivalence volume. 25% of 10 cm\u00b3 is 2.5 cm\u00b3. So at this point, 0.25 \u00d7 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol of NaOH has been added. So moles of NaOH added = 0.00025 mol.\n\nAt this point, let's calculate the pH. Since 25% of the acid has been neutralized, there's 75% of the acetic acid left, and 25% has been converted to acetate ions.\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol. After adding 0.00025 mol NaOH, the moles of CH3COOH left is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed is 0.00025 mol.\n\nSo the solution is a buffer solution of acetic acid and acetate ions. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).\n\nThe pKa of acetic acid is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. 1.85e-5 is 1.85 \u00d710^-5.

So pH = 4.735 + (-0.477) \u2248 4.258, which rounds to about 4.26. Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first pH value.\n\nNow, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to form the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) in solution. The solution now contains this conjugate base, which will hydrolyze in water to form OH^- ions, making the solution basic.\n\nThe moles of acetate ion at equivalence are 0.001 mol. The total volume is the initial volume (40 cm\u00b3) plus the equivalence point volume (10 cm\u00b3), so 50 cm\u00b3 or 0.05 L.\n\nSo the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nSo Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration is 0.02 M.\n\nWe can set up the expression for Kb:\n\nKb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]\n\nAssuming x is the [OH^-], so Kb \u2248 x\u00b2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10.\n\nx\u00b2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11\n\nx = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 3.288e-6 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] is approx 3.288e-6.

So the solution will contain the acetate ion in solution, which is a conjugate base of a weak acid. So the solution will be basic, and we need to calculate the pH of this solution.\n\nThe volume at equivalence is 40 cm\u00b3 +10 cm\u00b3=50 cm\u00b3=0.05 L. \n\nMoles of acetate ions: 0.001 mol.

Kw is 1e-14 at 25\u00b0C. Ka is 1.85e-5.\n\nSo Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approx 5.405e-10.\n\nSo Kb is small, so the hydrolysis is minimal, but the solution will be slightly basic.\n\nTo find the pH, set up the expression for Kb.\n\nThe initial concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let x be the concentration of OH^- produced.\n\nKb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] \u2248 x^2 / (0.02 -x). Since Kb is small, x will be much less than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 -x \u22480.02.\n\nSo x^2 = Kb * 0.02 =5.405e-10 * 0.02 \u22481.081e-11.\n\nx= sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5 M.\n\nSo [OH^-]=1.04e-5 M. pOH = -log(1.04e-5) \u22484.98.\n\npH=14 -4.98\u22489.02.",

So, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nFirst, let's find the concentrations of acetic acid and acetate at 25% titration.\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.001 mol. Adding 0.00025 mol of NaOH will react with acetic acid:\n\nCH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.\n\nSo, moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.\n\nMoles of CH3COO^- produced: 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe total volume is the initial volume plus the NaOH added. Initial volume after dilution was 40 cm\u00b3 (0.04 L). Adding 2.5 cm\u00b3 (0.0025 L) of NaOH solution: total volume is 0.0425 L.\n\nSo, concentrations:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M.\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M.\n\nNow, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).\n\nKa of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(1) - log(1.85e-5) \u2192 approx 4.74 (since log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5-0.267=4.733). So pKa \u2248 4.74.\n\nSo plugging into H-H:\n\npH = 4.74 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)\n\nCalculate the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 \u2248 0.333.\n\nLog(0.333) is about -0.477.\n\nSo pH \u2248 4.74 - 0.477 = 4.263. Which is approximately 4.26.\n\nSo the pH at 25% is about 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value, but let me see the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA) 4.26; 8.52\n\nB) 3.17; 6.73\n\nC)4.73;7.00\n\nD)4.57;6.92\n\nSo the first value matches option A. But what about the equivalence point?\n\nAt equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution.\n\nThe concentration of acetate (CH3COO^-) can be calculated. At equivalence, moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, and the total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 + 10 cm\u00b3 = 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L.\n\nSo [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nThe acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for acetate can be calculated from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5.\n\nSo Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nThe concentration is 0.02 M. Using the approximation for weak bases, [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * c).\n\nSo sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5 M.\n\npOH = -log(1.04e-5) \u2248 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 \u22489.02.",

Option A's first value is 4.26, so that's very close.\n\nNow, what about the equivalence point?\n\nAt equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So the solution is sodium acetate in water. Since sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid and strong base, the solution will be basic. So it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.\n\nThe steps to find pH at equivalence:\n\n1. Determine moles of sodium acetate at equivalence.\n\nAt equivalence, all 0.001 moles of acetic acid have reacted, producing 0.001 moles of acetate ions (CH3COO^-).\n\nThe total volume is the initial solution (40 cm\u00b3) plus the NaOH added (10 cm\u00b3), so 50 cm\u00b3 or 0.05 L.\n\nSo concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\n2. The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Since Kw is 1e-14 at 25\u00b0C.\n\nKb = 1e-14 / (1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10.\n\nSo Kb is 5.405e-10.\n\nThe concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So we can set up the expression.\n\nLet me denote [CH3COOH] = x, [OH^-] = x.\n\nSo Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) \u2248 x^2 / 0.02 since x will be very small compared to 0.02.\n\nSo x^2 \u2248 Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.\n\nx = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 3.288e-6 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] = 3.288e-6 M.\n\npOH = -log(3.288e-6) \u2248 let's compute this.\n\nlog(3.288e-6) = log(3.288) + log(1e-6) \u2248 0.5168 -6 = -5.4832. So pOH is 5.4832.\n\npH = 14 - pOH = 14 -5.4832 = 8.5168, approximately 8.52.\n\nSo the pH at equivalence is around 8.52.\n\nLooking at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52. Option D has 4.57 and 6.92. So option A seems to match both the 25% and equivalence points.",

Now, setting up Kb expression:\n\nKb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]\n\nAssuming x is the [OH^-] produced:\n\nKb = x^2 / (0.02 - x) \u2248 x^2 / 0.02, since Kb is very small.\n\nSo x^2 = Kb * 0.02 \u2192 x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x \u2248 sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2192 around 3.288e-6 M. \n\n[OH^-] is approximately 3.288e-6 M.

That should be correct.\n\nSo for the 25% titration point, we can model the solution as a buffer solution, since some of the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO^-). So, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nFirst, let's find the concentrations of acetic acid and acetate at 25% titration.\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.001 mol. Adding 0.00025 mol of NaOH will react with acetic acid:\n\nCH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.\n\nSo, moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.\n\nMoles of CH3COO^- produced: 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe total volume is the initial volume plus the NaOH added. Initial volume after dilution was 40 cm\u00b3 (0.04 L). Adding 2.5 cm\u00b3 (0.0025 L) of NaOH solution: total volume is 0.0425 L.\n\nSo, concentrations:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M.\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M.\n\nNow, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).\n\nKa of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(1) - log(1.85e-5) \u2192 approx 4.74 (since log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5-0.267=4.733). So pKa \u2248 4.74.\n\nSo plugging into H-H:\n\npH = 4.74 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)\n\nCalculate the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 \u2248 0.333.\n\nLog(0.333) is about -0.477.\n\nSo pH \u2248 4.74 - 0.477 = 4.263. Which is approximately 4.26.\n\nSo the pH at 25% is about 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value, but let me see the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA) 4.26; 8.52\n\nB) 3.17; 6.73\n\nC)4.73;7.00\n\nD)4.57;6.92\n\nSo the first value matches option A. But what about the equivalence point?\n\nAt equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution.\n\nThe concentration of acetate (CH3COO^-) can be calculated. At equivalence, moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, and the total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 + 10 cm\u00b3 = 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L.\n\nSo [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nThe acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for acetate can be calculated from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5.\n\nSo Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nThe concentration is 0.02 M. Using the approximation for weak bases, [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * c).\n\nSo sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5 M.\n\npOH = -log(1.04e-5) \u2248 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 \u22489.02.",
          "text2": "Wait, but I'm not sure if the 25% refers to the volume of NaOH added or the moles reacted.

So in 25%, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of acetic acid have reacted with NaOH, producing 0.00025 moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-).\n\nSo, at 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized. Let's model the solution.\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001 (from the diluted solution). When 25% is titrated, 0.00025 moles have reacted, so remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. The moles of acetate ion produced is 0.00025.\n\nThe total volume of the solution now is the initial 40 mL (diluted acetic acid) plus the 2.5 mL NaOH added. So total volume is 42.5 mL or 0.0425 L.\n\nSo the concentrations are:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approx 0.017647 M.\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M.\n\nNow, this is a buffer solution, so using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be appropriate.

So pH is about 4.733 - 0.477 \u2248 4.256. Rounded to two decimal places, that's 4.26. So the first pH value is 4.26.\n\nNow, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH), so the solution will be basic.\n\nAt equivalence point, the moles of acetate ions are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid. So 0.001 mol of CH3COO^-.\n\nThe total volume is 40 mL (original solution) plus 10 mL (NaOH added) = 50 mL or 0.05 L.\n\nSo concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nNow, acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid. In solution, it will hydrolyze according to:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Since Ka is 1.85e-5, Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nThe concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let's set up the expression for Kb.\n\nLet x be the concentration of OH^- produced.\n\nKb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] \u2248 x\u00b2 / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02.\n\nSo x\u00b2 \u2248 Kb * 0.02 \u2192 x\u00b2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x \u2248 sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2192 approximately 3.288e-6 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] \u2248 3.288e-6 M.

So approximately 8.52.\n\nSo the second pH value is 8.52.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52 as the two pH values. So that should be the correct option.",

So log(1/3) is -0.477, which gives pH=4.733 -0.477=4.256. So about 4.26. So the first part of the answer is 4.26.\n\nNow, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is the salt of a weak acid and a strong base. So the solution will be basic because acetate is a weak base.\n\nThe concentration of acetate at equivalence point: moles of acetate are 0.001 mol (same as initial moles of acetic acid). The total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 (original solution) + 10 cm\u00b3 (equivalence volume) = 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L.\n\nSo concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nThe acetate ion will hydrolyze in water:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for acetate can be calculated from Ka of acetic acid.

Looking at options, A is 4.26 and 8.52 as the two values.\n\nNow, what about the equivalence point?\n\nAt equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate ion (CH3COO^-). The solution is now a solution of sodium acetate in water, which is a basic solution because acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid.\n\nSo, the moles of acetate are equal to the moles of acetic acid initially, which is 0.001 mol.\n\nThe total volume is original 40 cm\u00b3 + equivalence volume 10 cm\u00b3 \u2192 50 cm\u00b3 or 0.05 L.\n\nSo concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nNow, to find pH, I need to calculate the hydrolysis of acetate in water.

So at 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH.\n\nSo first, let's tackle the pH at 25% titration. \n\nAt 25% titration, only a quarter of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since the initial moles of acetic acid was 0.001, the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And the moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025 moles.",
          "text2": "Oh wait, wait, 20 cm\u00b3 is 0.02 L. So 0.02 L \u00d7 0.05 M is 0.001 moles. Then you dilute to 0.04 L, so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh, so I made a mistake earlier. The initial diluted solution is 0.025 M, not 0.0125. Hmm, okay, that's an important step. So the initial concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\nNow, when we titrate this with NaOH. Let's think about the stoichiometry. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COONa + H2O.\n\nThe equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equals the moles of acetic acid. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed for equivalence is (moles) / (concentration) = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm\u00b3.\n\nThe question asks about 25% titration. So that's 25% of the equivalence volume. 25% of 10 cm\u00b3 is 2.5 cm\u00b3. So at this point, 0.25 \u00d7 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol of NaOH has been added. So moles of NaOH added = 0.00025 mol.\n\nAt this point, let's calculate the pH. Since 25% of the acid has been neutralized, there's 75% of the acetic acid left, and 25% has been converted to acetate ions.\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol. After adding 0.00025 mol NaOH, the moles of CH3COOH left is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed is 0.00025 mol.\n\nSo the solution is a buffer solution of acetic acid and acetate ions. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).\n\nThe pKa of acetic acid is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. 1.85e-5 is 1.85 \u00d710^-5. So pKa is about 4.735 (since log(1.85) is approximately 0.267, so 5 - 0.267 = 4.733, close to 4.735).\n\nNow, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is (0.00025) / (0.00075) = 1/3. So log(1/3) is approximately -0.477. So pH = 4.735 + (-0.477) \u2248 4.258, which rounds to about 4.26. Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first pH value.\n\nNow, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to form the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) in solution. The solution now contains this conjugate base, which will hydrolyze in water to form OH^- ions, making the solution basic.\n\nThe moles of acetate ion at equivalence are 0.001 mol. The total volume is the initial volume (40 cm\u00b3) plus the equivalence point volume (10 cm\u00b3), so 50 cm\u00b3 or 0.05 L.\n\nSo the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nSo Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration is 0.02 M.\n\nWe can set up the expression for Kb:\n\nKb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]\n\nAssuming x is the [OH^-], so Kb \u2248 x\u00b2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10.\n\nx\u00b2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11\n\nx = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 3.288e-6 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] is approx 3.288e-6. Then pOH is -log(3.288e-6). Let's calculate that:\n\nlog(3.288) \u2248 0.516, so log(3.288e-6) is -5.484. So pOH is 5.484. Then pH is 14 - 5.484 \u2248 8.516, which is about 8.52.",

So the solution is sodium acetate in water. Since sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid and strong base, the solution will be basic. So it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.\n\nThe steps to find pH at equivalence:\n\n1. Determine moles of sodium acetate at equivalence.\n\nAt equivalence, all 0.001 moles of acetic acid have reacted, producing 0.001 moles of acetate ions (CH3COO^-).\n\nThe total volume is the initial solution (40 cm\u00b3) plus the NaOH added (10 cm\u00b3), so 50 cm\u00b3 or 0.05 L.\n\nSo concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\n2. The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Since Kw is 1e-14 at 25\u00b0C.\n\nKb = 1e-14 / (1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10.\n\nSo Kb is 5.405e-10.\n\nThe concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

So moles of NaOH added is 0.00025 moles.\n\nReaction: each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid, producing a mole of acetate.\n\nSo after adding 0.00025 moles NaOH, the moles of acetic acid will be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. The moles of acetate will be 0.00025 moles.\n\nThe total volume at this point is the initial volume (40 cm\u00b3) plus the volume of NaOH added. The volume of NaOH added is (0.00025 moles) / (0.1 M) ) = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm\u00b3.

At this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

Let me compute that.\n\nLog(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5) \u2192 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733. Approximately 4.73.\n\nSo, at 25% titration, the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00025) / (0.00075) = 1/3. So log(1/3) is log(0.333) which is about -0.477.\n\nSo, pH = 4.73 + (-0.477) \u2248 4.253. Rounding, that's about 4.25. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52, option D is 4.57, etc.",

          "text2": "perhaps another approach: moles of NaOH added at 25% would be 25% of 0.001 mol, which is 0.00025 mol. So, moles of NaOH added is 0.00025 mol. That should be correct.\n\nSo for the 25% titration point, we can model the solution as a buffer solution, since some of the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO^-). So, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nFirst, let's find the concentrations of acetic acid and acetate at 25% titration.\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.001 mol. Adding 0.00025 mol of NaOH will react with acetic acid:\n\nCH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.\n\nSo, moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.\n\nMoles of CH3COO^- produced: 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe total volume is the initial volume plus the NaOH added. Initial volume after dilution was 40 cm\u00b3 (0.04 L). Adding 2.5 cm\u00b3 (0.0025 L) of NaOH solution: total volume is 0.0425 L.\n\nSo, concentrations:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M.\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M.\n\nNow, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).\n\nKa of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(1) - log(1.85e-5) \u2192 approx 4.74 (since log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5-0.267=4.733). So pKa \u2248 4.74.\n\nSo plugging into H-H:\n\npH = 4.74 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)\n\nCalculate the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 \u2248 0.333.\n\nLog(0.333) is about -0.477.\n\nSo pH \u2248 4.74 - 0.477 = 4.263. Which is approximately 4.26.\n\nSo the pH at 25% is about 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value, but let me see the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA) 4.26; 8.52\n\nB) 3.17; 6.73\n\nC)4.73;7.00\n\nD)4.57;6.92\n\nSo the first value matches option A. But what about the equivalence point?\n\nAt equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution.\n\nThe concentration of acetate (CH3COO^-) can be calculated. At equivalence, moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, and the total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 + 10 cm\u00b3 = 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L.\n\nSo [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nThe acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for acetate can be calculated from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5.\n\nSo Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nThe concentration is 0.02 M. Using the approximation for weak bases, [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * c).\n\nSo sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5 M.\n\npOH = -log(1.04e-5) \u2248 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 \u22489.02.",

Since each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, the volume of NaOH added is 0.00025 moles / 0.1 M = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo total volume is 40 +2.5=42.5 cm\u00b3=0.0425 L.\n\nSo concentrations:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M.\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M.\n\nNow, since this is a buffer solution (weak acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\npH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).\n\npKa = -log(1.85e-5) \u2248 4.736.\n\n[A^-] is acetate, [HA] is acetic acid.\n\nSo pH = 4.736 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).\n\nCalculate the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 \u2248 0.333.\n\nLog(0.333) \u2248 -0.477.\n\nSo pH \u2248 4.736 -0.477 \u22484.259.\n\nRounding to two decimal places, 4.26.\n\nSo for 25% titration, pH is approximately 4.26.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52.

Let's model the solution.\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001 (from the diluted solution). When 25% is titrated, 0.00025 moles have reacted, so remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

So the solution is sodium acetate in water. Since sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid and strong base, the solution will be basic. So it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.\n\nThe steps to find pH at equivalence:\n\n1. Determine moles of sodium acetate at equivalence.\n\nAt equivalence, all 0.001 moles of acetic acid have reacted, producing 0.001 moles of acetate ions (CH3COO^-).\n\nThe total volume is the initial solution (40 cm\u00b3) plus the NaOH added (10 cm\u00b3), so 50 cm\u00b3 or 0.05 L.\n\nSo concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\n2. The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Since Kw is 1e-14 at 25\u00b0C.\n\nKb = 1e-14 / (1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10.\n\nSo Kb is 5.405e-10.\n\nThe concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So we can set up the expression.\n\nLet me denote [CH3COOH] = x, [OH^-] = x.\n\nSo Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) \u2248 x^2 / 0.02 since x will be very small compared to 0.02.\n\nSo x^2 \u2248 Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.\n\nx = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 3.288e-6 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] = 3.288e-6 M.\n\npOH = -log(3.288e-6) \u2248 let's compute this.\n\nlog(3.288e-6) = log(3.288) + log(1e-6) \u2248 0.5168 -6 = -5.4832.

Since Kb is very small, we can assume that the hydrolysis doesn't proceed much, so we can approximate [OH^-] using the formula:\n\nKb \u2248 [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]\n\nAssuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced, then:\n\nKb \u2248 x^2 / (0.02 - x) \u2192 since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so (0.02 - x) \u2248 0.02.\n\nSo, x^2 / 0.02 \u2248 Kb \u2192 x^2 = Kb * 0.02 \u2192 x = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02).\n\nCalculating:\n\n5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.\n\nsqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 3.288e-6.\n\nSo, [OH^-] \u2248 3.288e-6 M \u2192 pOH = -log(3.288e-6) \u2248 5.486.\n\nSo, pH = 14 - 5.486 \u2248 8.514.",

Let me think about the steps step by step.\n\nFirst, find the concentration of the diluted acetic acid.\n\nDiluted volume is 40 cm\u00b3 (20 + 20). The moles are 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Correct.\n\nNow, when titrated with 0.1 M NaOH. Let's find the equivalence point.\n\nMoles of acetic acid = 0.001 mol. To neutralize, NaOH will donate OH- to convert CH3COOH to CH3COO^- Na^+.\n\nThe reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O.\n\nMoles of NaOH needed = 0.001 mol.\n\nVolume of NaOH needed: moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm\u00b3.",

So the volume required is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 mL. So equivalence point is at 10 mL of NaOH.\n\nBut the question is about 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence volume. So 25% of 10 mL is 2.5 mL. So at 2.5 mL, how much has reacted?\n\nMoles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Since the reaction is 1:1, 0.00025 mol of acetic acid reacts, producing 0.00025 mol of acetate ion. \n\nSo, the initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) is 0.001 mol. After reaction, moles of CH3COOH left is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed is 0.00025 mol.\n\nNow, the total volume of the solution is initial 40 mL plus the NaOH added.

So at 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH added, that's the 25% point.\n\nSo let's tackle each part: pH at 25% titration and pH at equivalence point.\n\nStarting with the 25% point.\n\nAt this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized. The reaction is 1:1, so 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH would add 0.1 * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol of NaOH. So moles reacted: 0.00025 mol. Since the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001, the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The NaOH converts some of the acetic acid to acetate ions. So moles of acetate formed are 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe total volume at this point is the original 40 cm\u00b3 plus the 2.5 cm\u00b3 NaOH. So 42.5 cm\u00b3 = 0.0425 L.\n\nSo the concentrations are: [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425, and [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425.\n\nLet me compute these. \n\n0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L = 0.017647 M (approx)\n0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L = 0.005882 M (approx)\n\nSo the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).\n\nThe pKa is -log(1.85e-5).

So, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nFirst, let's find the concentrations of acetic acid and acetate at 25% titration.\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.001 mol. Adding 0.00025 mol of NaOH will react with acetic acid:\n\nCH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.\n\nSo, moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.\n\nMoles of CH3COO^- produced: 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe total volume is the initial volume plus the NaOH added.

So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(1) - log(1.85e-5) \u2192 approx 4.74 (since log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5-0.267=4.733).

Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution.\n\nThe concentration of acetate (CH3COO^-) can be calculated. At equivalence, moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, and the total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 + 10 cm\u00b3 = 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L.\n\nSo [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nThe acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for acetate can be calculated from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5.\n\nSo Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nThe concentration is 0.02 M. Using the approximation for weak bases, [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * c).\n\nSo sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5 M.\n\npOH = -log(1.04e-5) \u2248 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 \u22489.02.",

The total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 (original solution) + 10 cm\u00b3 (equivalence volume) = 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L.\n\nSo concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nThe acetate ion will hydrolyze in water:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for acetate can be calculated from Ka of acetic acid. Since Kw = Ka * Kb, so Kb = Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5.\n\nSo Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nThe acetate concentration is 0.02 M. We can set up the expression for Kb:\n\nKb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]\n\nAssuming x is the [OH^-], which will be small because Kb is small.\n\nSo:\n\nx^2 / (0.02 - x) \u2248 x^2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10.\n\nSo x^2 \u2248 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.\n\nx \u2248 sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] is about 1.04e-5 M.

The initial diluted solution is 0.025 M, not 0.0125. Hmm, okay, that's an important step. So the initial concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\nNow, when we titrate this with NaOH. Let's think about the stoichiometry. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COONa + H2O.\n\nThe equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equals the moles of acetic acid. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed for equivalence is (moles) / (concentration) = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm\u00b3.\n\nThe question asks about 25% titration. So that's 25% of the equivalence volume. 25% of 10 cm\u00b3 is 2.5 cm\u00b3. So at this point, 0.25 \u00d7 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol of NaOH has been added. So moles of NaOH added = 0.00025 mol.\n\nAt this point, let's calculate the pH. Since 25% of the acid has been neutralized, there's 75% of the acetic acid left, and 25% has been converted to acetate ions.\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol. After adding 0.00025 mol NaOH, the moles of CH3COOH left is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed is 0.00025 mol.\n\nSo the solution is a buffer solution of acetic acid and acetate ions. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).\n\nThe pKa of acetic acid is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. 1.85e-5 is 1.85 \u00d710^-5.

So pH = 4.735 + (-0.477) \u2248 4.258, which rounds to about 4.26. Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first pH value.\n\nNow, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to form the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) in solution. The solution now contains this conjugate base, which will hydrolyze in water to form OH^- ions, making the solution basic.\n\nThe moles of acetate ion at equivalence are 0.001 mol. The total volume is the initial volume (40 cm\u00b3) plus the equivalence point volume (10 cm\u00b3), so 50 cm\u00b3 or 0.05 L.\n\nSo the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nSo Kb is 5.405e-10.

Option A's first value is 4.26, so that's very close.\n\nNow, what about the equivalence point?\n\nAt equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So the solution is sodium acetate in water. Since sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid and strong base, the solution will be basic. So it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.\n\nThe steps to find pH at equivalence:\n\n1. Determine moles of sodium acetate at equivalence.\n\nAt equivalence, all 0.001 moles of acetic acid have reacted, producing 0.001 moles of acetate ions (CH3COO^-).\n\nThe total volume is the initial solution (40 cm\u00b3) plus the NaOH added (10 cm\u00b3), so 50 cm\u00b3 or 0.05 L.\n\nSo concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\n2. The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Since Kw is 1e-14 at 25\u00b0C.\n\nKb = 1e-14 / (1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10.\n\nSo Kb is 5.405e-10.\n\nThe concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So we can set up the expression.\n\nLet me denote [CH3COOH] = x, [OH^-] = x.\n\nSo Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) \u2248 x^2 / 0.02 since x will be very small compared to 0.02.\n\nSo x^2 \u2248 Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.\n\nx = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 3.288e-6 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] = 3.288e-6 M.\n\npOH = -log(3.288e-6) \u2248 let's compute this.\n\nlog(3.288e-6) = log(3.288) + log(1e-6) \u2248 0.5168 -6 = -5.4832. So pOH is 5.4832.\n\npH = 14 - pOH = 14 -5.4832 = 8.5168, approximately 8.52.\n\nSo the pH at equivalence is around 8.52.\n\nLooking at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52. Option D has 4.57 and 6.92. So option A seems to match both the 25% and equivalence points.",

Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH), so the solution will be basic.\n\nAt equivalence point, the moles of acetate ions are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid. So 0.001 mol of CH3COO^-.\n\nThe total volume is 40 mL (original solution) plus 10 mL (NaOH added) = 50 mL or 0.05 L.\n\nSo concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nNow, acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid. In solution, it will hydrolyze according to:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Since Ka is 1.85e-5, Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nThe concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let's set up the expression for Kb.\n\nLet x be the concentration of OH^- produced.\n\nKb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] \u2248 x\u00b2 / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02.\n\nSo x\u00b2 \u2248 Kb * 0.02 \u2192 x\u00b2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x \u2248 sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2192 approximately 3.288e-6 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] \u2248 3.288e-6 M. Then pOH = -log([OH^-]).\n\nlog(3.288e-6) is log(3.288) + log(1e-6). Log(3.288) is about 0.517, so pOH \u2248 5.483.\n\npH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 \u2248 8.517. So approximately 8.52.\n\nSo the second pH value is 8.52.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52 as the two pH values. So that should be the correct option.",

So, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nFirst, let's find the concentrations of acetic acid and acetate at 25% titration.\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.001 mol. Adding 0.00025 mol of NaOH will react with acetic acid:\n\nCH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.\n\nSo, moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.\n\nMoles of CH3COO^- produced: 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe total volume is the initial volume plus the NaOH added. Initial volume after dilution was 40 cm\u00b3 (0.04 L). Adding 2.5 cm\u00b3 (0.0025 L) of NaOH solution: total volume is 0.0425 L.\n\nSo, concentrations:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M.\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M.\n\nNow, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).\n\nKa of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(1) - log(1.85e-5) \u2192 approx 4.74 (since log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5-0.267=4.733). So pKa \u2248 4.74.\n\nSo plugging into H-H:\n\npH = 4.74 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)\n\nCalculate the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 \u2248 0.333.\n\nLog(0.333) is about -0.477.\n\nSo pH \u2248 4.74 - 0.477 = 4.263. Which is approximately 4.26.\n\nSo the pH at 25% is about 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value, but let me see the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA) 4.26; 8.52\n\nB) 3.17; 6.73\n\nC)4.73;7.00\n\nD)4.57;6.92\n\nSo the first value matches option A. But what about the equivalence point?\n\nAt equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution.\n\nThe concentration of acetate (CH3COO^-) can be calculated. At equivalence, moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, and the total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 + 10 cm\u00b3 = 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L.\n\nSo [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nThe acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for acetate can be calculated from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5.\n\nSo Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nThe concentration is 0.02 M. Using the approximation for weak bases, [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * c).\n\nSo sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5 M.\n\npOH = -log(1.04e-5) \u2248 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 \u22489.02.",

So the first pH is approximately 4.25. Option A's first value is 4.26, so that's very close.\n\nNow, what about the equivalence point?\n\nAt equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So the solution is sodium acetate in water. Since sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid and strong base, the solution will be basic. So it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.\n\nThe steps to find pH at equivalence:\n\n1. Determine moles of sodium acetate at equivalence.\n\nAt equivalence, all 0.001 moles of acetic acid have reacted, producing 0.001 moles of acetate ions (CH3COO^-).\n\nThe total volume is the initial solution (40 cm\u00b3) plus the NaOH added (10 cm\u00b3), so 50 cm\u00b3 or 0.05 L.\n\nSo concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\n2. The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Since Kw is 1e-14 at 25\u00b0C.\n\nKb = 1e-14 / (1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10.\n\nSo Kb is 5.405e-10.\n\nThe concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So we can set up the expression.\n\nLet me denote [CH3COOH] = x, [OH^-] = x.\n\nSo Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) \u2248 x^2 / 0.02 since x will be very small compared to 0.02.\n\nSo x^2 \u2248 Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.\n\nx = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 3.288e-6 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] = 3.288e-6 M.\n\npOH = -log(3.288e-6) \u2248 let's compute this.\n\nlog(3.288e-6) = log(3.288) + log(1e-6) \u2248 0.5168 -6 = -5.4832. So pOH is 5.4832.\n\npH = 14 - pOH = 14 -5.4832 = 8.5168, approximately 8.52.\n\nSo the pH at equivalence is around 8.52.\n\nLooking at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52.

So the log is log(1/3) \u2248 -0.477.\n\nAdding to pKa 4.733: 4.733 - 0.477 \u2248 4.256. So pH is approximately 4.26. Looking at options, option A gives 4.26 as the first value. Option D's first value is 4.57, which doesn't match.\n\nSo, at 25% titration, the pH is about 4.26. Now, what about the equivalence point?\n\nAt equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is 0.001 mol of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) in a total volume of (40 cm\u00b3 + 10 cm\u00b3) = 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L.\n\nSo, [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nNow, acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic. The reaction is:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for acetate can be calculated from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25\u00b0C. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.4054e-10.",

That should be correct.\n\nSo for the 25% titration point, we can model the solution as a buffer solution, since some of the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO^-). So, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nFirst, let's find the concentrations of acetic acid and acetate at 25% titration.\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.001 mol. Adding 0.00025 mol of NaOH will react with acetic acid:\n\nCH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.\n\nSo, moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.\n\nMoles of CH3COO^- produced: 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe total volume is the initial volume plus the NaOH added. Initial volume after dilution was 40 cm\u00b3 (0.04 L). Adding 2.5 cm\u00b3 (0.0025 L) of NaOH solution: total volume is 0.0425 L.\n\nSo, concentrations:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M.\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M.\n\nNow, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).\n\nKa of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(1) - log(1.85e-5) \u2192 approx 4.74 (since log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5-0.267=4.733). So pKa \u2248 4.74.\n\nSo plugging into H-H:\n\npH = 4.74 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)\n\nCalculate the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 \u2248 0.333.\n\nLog(0.333) is about -0.477.\n\nSo pH \u2248 4.74 - 0.477 = 4.263. Which is approximately 4.26.\n\nSo the pH at 25% is about 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value, but let me see the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA) 4.26; 8.52\n\nB) 3.17; 6.73\n\nC)4.73;7.00\n\nD)4.57;6.92\n\nSo the first value matches option A. But what about the equivalence point?\n\nAt equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution.\n\nThe concentration of acetate (CH3COO^-) can be calculated. At equivalence, moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, and the total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 + 10 cm\u00b3 = 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L.\n\nSo [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nThe acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for acetate can be calculated from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5.\n\nSo Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nThe concentration is 0.02 M. Using the approximation for weak bases, [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * c).\n\nSo sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5 M.\n\npOH = -log(1.04e-5) \u2248 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 \u22489.02.",

So in 25%, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of acetic acid have reacted with NaOH, producing 0.00025 moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-).\n\nSo, at 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized. Let's model the solution.\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001 (from the diluted solution). When 25% is titrated, 0.00025 moles have reacted, so remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. The moles of acetate ion produced is 0.00025.\n\nThe total volume of the solution now is the initial 40 mL (diluted acetic acid) plus the 2.5 mL NaOH added. So total volume is 42.5 mL or 0.0425 L.\n\nSo the concentrations are:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approx 0.017647 M.\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M.\n\nNow, this is a buffer solution, so using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be appropriate.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH), so the solution will be basic.\n\nAt equivalence point, the moles of acetate ions are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid. So 0.001 mol of CH3COO^-.\n\nThe total volume is 40 mL (original solution) plus 10 mL (NaOH added) = 50 mL or 0.05 L.\n\nSo concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nNow, acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid.

Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02.\n\nSo x\u00b2 \u2248 Kb * 0.02 \u2192 x\u00b2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x \u2248 sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2192 approximately 3.288e-6 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] \u2248 3.288e-6 M.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is the salt of a weak acid and a strong base. So the solution will be basic because acetate is a weak base.\n\nThe concentration of acetate at equivalence point: moles of acetate are 0.001 mol (same as initial moles of acetic acid). The total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 (original solution) + 10 cm\u00b3 (equivalence volume) = 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L.\n\nSo concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nThe acetate ion will hydrolyze in water:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for acetate can be calculated from Ka of acetic acid.

Looking at options, A is 4.26 and 8.52 as the two values.\n\nNow, what about the equivalence point?\n\nAt equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate ion (CH3COO^-). The solution is now a solution of sodium acetate in water, which is a basic solution because acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid.\n\nSo, the moles of acetate are equal to the moles of acetic acid initially, which is 0.001 mol.\n\nThe total volume is original 40 cm\u00b3 + equivalence volume 10 cm\u00b3 \u2192 50 cm\u00b3 or 0.05 L.\n\nSo concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nNow, to find pH, I need to calculate the hydrolysis of acetate in water.

          "text1": "Wait, 25% of what? Oh, I think it means 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence. So 25% of 10 cm\u00b3 is 2.5 cm\u00b3. So at 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH.\n\nSo first, let's tackle the pH at 25% titration. \n\nAt 25% titration, only a quarter of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since the initial moles of acetic acid was 0.001, the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And the moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025 moles.",
          "text2": "Oh wait, wait, 20 cm\u00b3 is 0.02 L. So 0.02 L \u00d7 0.05 M is 0.001 moles. Then you dilute to 0.04 L, so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh, so I made a mistake earlier. The initial diluted solution is 0.025 M, not 0.0125. Hmm, okay, that's an important step. So the initial concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\nNow, when we titrate this with NaOH. Let's think about the stoichiometry. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COONa + H2O.\n\nThe equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equals the moles of acetic acid. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed for equivalence is (moles) / (concentration) = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm\u00b3.\n\nThe question asks about 25% titration. So that's 25% of the equivalence volume. 25% of 10 cm\u00b3 is 2.5 cm\u00b3. So at this point, 0.25 \u00d7 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol of NaOH has been added. So moles of NaOH added = 0.00025 mol.\n\nAt this point, let's calculate the pH. Since 25% of the acid has been neutralized, there's 75% of the acetic acid left, and 25% has been converted to acetate ions.\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol. After adding 0.00025 mol NaOH, the moles of CH3COOH left is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed is 0.00025 mol.\n\nSo the solution is a buffer solution of acetic acid and acetate ions. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).\n\nThe pKa of acetic acid is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. 1.85e-5 is 1.85 \u00d710^-5. So pKa is about 4.735 (since log(1.85) is approximately 0.267, so 5 - 0.267 = 4.733, close to 4.735).\n\nNow, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is (0.00025) / (0.00075) = 1/3. So log(1/3) is approximately -0.477. So pH = 4.735 + (-0.477) \u2248 4.258, which rounds to about 4.26. Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first pH value.\n\nNow, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to form the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) in solution. The solution now contains this conjugate base, which will hydrolyze in water to form OH^- ions, making the solution basic.\n\nThe moles of acetate ion at equivalence are 0.001 mol. The total volume is the initial volume (40 cm\u00b3) plus the equivalence point volume (10 cm\u00b3), so 50 cm\u00b3 or 0.05 L.\n\nSo the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nSo Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration is 0.02 M.\n\nWe can set up the expression for Kb:\n\nKb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]\n\nAssuming x is the [OH^-], so Kb \u2248 x\u00b2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10.\n\nx\u00b2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11\n\nx = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 3.288e-6 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] is approx 3.288e-6. Then pOH is -log(3.288e-6). Let's calculate that:\n\nlog(3.288) \u2248 0.516, so log(3.288e-6) is -5.484. So pOH is 5.484. Then pH is 14 - 5.484 \u2248 8.516, which is about 8.52.",

Maybe a more accurate calculation would get 4.25 or 4.26.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should compute it more precisely.\n\nLet me compute [A^-] and [HA] more accurately.\n\nMoles HA = 0.00075, A^- = 0.00025.\n\nVolume is 0.0425 L.\n\nSo [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.0176470588 M.\n\n[A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.0058823529 M.\n\nRatio: 0.0058823529 / 0.0176470588 = 0.333333333.\n\nSo exactly 1/3.\n\nLog(1/3) is log(0.333333) \u2248 -0.4771.\n\nSo pH = 4.73 + (-0.4771) = 4.2529, which is ~4.25.

So the solution is sodium acetate in water. Since sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid and strong base, the solution will be basic. So it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.\n\nThe steps to find pH at equivalence:\n\n1. Determine moles of sodium acetate at equivalence.\n\nAt equivalence, all 0.001 moles of acetic acid have reacted, producing 0.001 moles of acetate ions (CH3COO^-).\n\nThe total volume is the initial solution (40 cm\u00b3) plus the NaOH added (10 cm\u00b3), so 50 cm\u00b3 or 0.05 L.\n\nSo concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\n2. The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Since Kw is 1e-14 at 25\u00b0C.\n\nKb = 1e-14 / (1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10.\n\nSo Kb is 5.405e-10.\n\nThe concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

Because 10 mL is the total needed for equivalence, so 2.5 mL is 25%.\n\nSo, let's tackle each part: pH at 25% titration and pH at equivalence point.\n\nStarting with the 25% point. At this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. So, for every mole of NaOH added, a mole of CH3COOH is converted to CH3COO^-.\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.001 moles. Moles of NaOH added at 25% point: 0.1 M \u00d7 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. So, moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. Moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed: 0.00025 moles.\n\nThe total solution volume at this point is the initial solution (40 mL) plus the NaOH added (2.5 mL), which is 42.5 mL or 0.0425 L. So the concentrations are:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M.\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M.\n\nSince this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).",

So, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nFirst, let's find the concentrations of acetic acid and acetate at 25% titration.\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.001 mol. Adding 0.00025 mol of NaOH will react with acetic acid:\n\nCH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.\n\nSo, moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.\n\nMoles of CH3COO^- produced: 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe total volume is the initial volume plus the NaOH added. Initial volume after dilution was 40 cm\u00b3 (0.04 L). Adding 2.5 cm\u00b3 (0.0025 L) of NaOH solution: total volume is 0.0425 L.\n\nSo, concentrations:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M.\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M.\n\nNow, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).\n\nKa of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(1) - log(1.85e-5) \u2192 approx 4.74 (since log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5-0.267=4.733). So pKa \u2248 4.74.\n\nSo plugging into H-H:\n\npH = 4.74 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)\n\nCalculate the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 \u2248 0.333.\n\nLog(0.333) is about -0.477.\n\nSo pH \u2248 4.74 - 0.477 = 4.263. Which is approximately 4.26.\n\nSo the pH at 25% is about 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value, but let me see the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA) 4.26; 8.52\n\nB) 3.17; 6.73\n\nC)4.73;7.00\n\nD)4.57;6.92\n\nSo the first value matches option A. But what about the equivalence point?\n\nAt equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution.\n\nThe concentration of acetate (CH3COO^-) can be calculated. At equivalence, moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, and the total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 + 10 cm\u00b3 = 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L.\n\nSo [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nThe acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for acetate can be calculated from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5.\n\nSo Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nThe concentration is 0.02 M. Using the approximation for weak bases, [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * c).\n\nSo sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5 M.\n\npOH = -log(1.04e-5) \u2248 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 \u22489.02.",

So the first pH is approximately 4.25. Option A's first value is 4.26, so that's very close.\n\nNow, what about the equivalence point?\n\nAt equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So the solution is sodium acetate in water. Since sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid and strong base, the solution will be basic. So it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.\n\nThe steps to find pH at equivalence:\n\n1. Determine moles of sodium acetate at equivalence.\n\nAt equivalence, all 0.001 moles of acetic acid have reacted, producing 0.001 moles of acetate ions (CH3COO^-).\n\nThe total volume is the initial solution (40 cm\u00b3) plus the NaOH added (10 cm\u00b3), so 50 cm\u00b3 or 0.05 L.\n\nSo concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\n2. The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Since Kw is 1e-14 at 25\u00b0C.\n\nKb = 1e-14 / (1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10.\n\nSo Kb is 5.405e-10.\n\nThe concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So we can set up the expression.\n\nLet me denote [CH3COOH] = x, [OH^-] = x.\n\nSo Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) \u2248 x^2 / 0.02 since x will be very small compared to 0.02.\n\nSo x^2 \u2248 Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.\n\nx = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 3.288e-6 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] = 3.288e-6 M.\n\npOH = -log(3.288e-6) \u2248 let's compute this.\n\nlog(3.288e-6) = log(3.288) + log(1e-6) \u2248 0.5168 -6 = -5.4832. So pOH is 5.4832.\n\npH = 14 - pOH = 14 -5.4832 = 8.5168, approximately 8.52.\n\nSo the pH at equivalence is around 8.52.\n\nLooking at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52. Option D has 4.57 and 6.92. So option A seems to match both the 25% and equivalence points.",

So at 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH added, that's the 25% point.\n\nSo let's tackle each part: pH at 25% titration and pH at equivalence point.\n\nStarting with the 25% point.\n\nAt this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized. The reaction is 1:1, so 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH would add 0.1 * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol of NaOH. So moles reacted: 0.00025 mol. Since the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001, the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The NaOH converts some of the acetic acid to acetate ions. So moles of acetate formed are 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe total volume at this point is the original 40 cm\u00b3 plus the 2.5 cm\u00b3 NaOH.

So, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nFirst, let's find the concentrations of acetic acid and acetate at 25% titration.\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.001 mol.

So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(1) - log(1.85e-5) \u2192 approx 4.74 (since log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5-0.267=4.733).

Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution.\n\nThe concentration of acetate (CH3COO^-) can be calculated. At equivalence, moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, and the total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 + 10 cm\u00b3 = 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L.\n\nSo [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nThe acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for acetate can be calculated from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5.\n\nSo Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nThe concentration is 0.02 M.

The total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 (original solution) + 10 cm\u00b3 (equivalence volume) = 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L.\n\nSo concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nThe acetate ion will hydrolyze in water:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for acetate can be calculated from Ka of acetic acid.

Looking at options, A is 4.26 and 8.52 as the two values.\n\nNow, what about the equivalence point?\n\nAt equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate ion (CH3COO^-). The solution is now a solution of sodium acetate in water, which is a basic solution because acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid.\n\nSo, the moles of acetate are equal to the moles of acetic acid initially, which is 0.001 mol.\n\nThe total volume is original 40 cm\u00b3 + equivalence volume 10 cm\u00b3 \u2192 50 cm\u00b3 or 0.05 L.\n\nSo concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nNow, to find pH, I need to calculate the hydrolysis of acetate in water.

So at 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH.\n\nSo first, let's tackle the pH at 25% titration. \n\nAt 25% titration, only a quarter of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since the initial moles of acetic acid was 0.001, the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And the moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025 moles.",
          "text2": "Oh wait, wait, 20 cm\u00b3 is 0.02 L. So 0.02 L \u00d7 0.05 M is 0.001 moles. Then you dilute to 0.04 L, so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh, so I made a mistake earlier. The initial diluted solution is 0.025 M, not 0.0125. Hmm, okay, that's an important step. So the initial concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\nNow, when we titrate this with NaOH. Let's think about the stoichiometry. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COONa + H2O.\n\nThe equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equals the moles of acetic acid. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed for equivalence is (moles) / (concentration) = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm\u00b3.\n\nThe question asks about 25% titration. So that's 25% of the equivalence volume. 25% of 10 cm\u00b3 is 2.5 cm\u00b3. So at this point, 0.25 \u00d7 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol of NaOH has been added. So moles of NaOH added = 0.00025 mol.\n\nAt this point, let's calculate the pH. Since 25% of the acid has been neutralized, there's 75% of the acetic acid left, and 25% has been converted to acetate ions.\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol. After adding 0.00025 mol NaOH, the moles of CH3COOH left is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed is 0.00025 mol.\n\nSo the solution is a buffer solution of acetic acid and acetate ions. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).\n\nThe pKa of acetic acid is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. 1.85e-5 is 1.85 \u00d710^-5. So pKa is about 4.735 (since log(1.85) is approximately 0.267, so 5 - 0.267 = 4.733, close to 4.735).\n\nNow, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is (0.00025) / (0.00075) = 1/3. So log(1/3) is approximately -0.477. So pH = 4.735 + (-0.477) \u2248 4.258, which rounds to about 4.26. Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first pH value.\n\nNow, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to form the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) in solution. The solution now contains this conjugate base, which will hydrolyze in water to form OH^- ions, making the solution basic.\n\nThe moles of acetate ion at equivalence are 0.001 mol. The total volume is the initial volume (40 cm\u00b3) plus the equivalence point volume (10 cm\u00b3), so 50 cm\u00b3 or 0.05 L.\n\nSo the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nSo Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration is 0.02 M.\n\nWe can set up the expression for Kb:\n\nKb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]\n\nAssuming x is the [OH^-], so Kb \u2248 x\u00b2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10.\n\nx\u00b2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11\n\nx = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 3.288e-6 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] is approx 3.288e-6. Then pOH is -log(3.288e-6). Let's calculate that:\n\nlog(3.288) \u2248 0.516, so log(3.288e-6) is -5.484. So pOH is 5.484. Then pH is 14 - 5.484 \u2248 8.516, which is about 8.52.",

At equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is the salt of a weak acid and a strong base.

So, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nFirst, let's find the concentrations of acetic acid and acetate at 25% titration.\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.001 mol. Adding 0.00025 mol of NaOH will react with acetic acid:\n\nCH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.\n\nSo, moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.\n\nMoles of CH3COO^- produced: 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe total volume is the initial volume plus the NaOH added. Initial volume after dilution was 40 cm\u00b3 (0.04 L). Adding 2.5 cm\u00b3 (0.0025 L) of NaOH solution: total volume is 0.0425 L.\n\nSo, concentrations:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M.\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M.\n\nNow, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).\n\nKa of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(1) - log(1.85e-5) \u2192 approx 4.74 (since log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5-0.267=4.733). So pKa \u2248 4.74.\n\nSo plugging into H-H:\n\npH = 4.74 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)\n\nCalculate the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 \u2248 0.333.\n\nLog(0.333) is about -0.477.\n\nSo pH \u2248 4.74 - 0.477 = 4.263. Which is approximately 4.26.\n\nSo the pH at 25% is about 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value, but let me see the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA) 4.26; 8.52\n\nB) 3.17; 6.73\n\nC)4.73;7.00\n\nD)4.57;6.92\n\nSo the first value matches option A. But what about the equivalence point?\n\nAt equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution.\n\nThe concentration of acetate (CH3COO^-) can be calculated. At equivalence, moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, and the total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 + 10 cm\u00b3 = 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L.\n\nSo [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nThe acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for acetate can be calculated from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5.\n\nSo Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nThe concentration is 0.02 M. Using the approximation for weak bases, [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * c).\n\nSo sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5 M.\n\npOH = -log(1.04e-5) \u2248 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 \u22489.02.",

So the volume required is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 mL. So equivalence point is at 10 mL of NaOH.\n\nBut the question is about 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence volume.

So 42.5 cm\u00b3 = 0.0425 L.\n\nSo the concentrations are: [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425, and [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425.\n\nLet me compute these. \n\n0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L = 0.017647 M (approx)\n0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L = 0.005882 M (approx)\n\nSo the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).\n\nThe pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. \n\nLog(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.\n\nSo pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let's compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 \u2248 0.333. Log(0.333) is about -0.477.\n\nSo pH \u2248 4.733 - 0.477 \u2248 4.256. Hmm, so approximately 4.26.

So pH is about 4.733 - 0.477 \u2248 4.256. Rounded to two decimal places, that's 4.26. So the first pH value is 4.26.\n\nNow, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH), so the solution will be basic.\n\nAt equivalence point, the moles of acetate ions are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid. So 0.001 mol of CH3COO^-.\n\nThe total volume is 40 mL (original solution) plus 10 mL (NaOH added) = 50 mL or 0.05 L.\n\nSo concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nNow, acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid. In solution, it will hydrolyze according to:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Since Ka is 1.85e-5, Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nThe concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let's set up the expression for Kb.\n\nLet x be the concentration of OH^- produced.\n\nKb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] \u2248 x\u00b2 / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02.\n\nSo x\u00b2 \u2248 Kb * 0.02 \u2192 x\u00b2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x \u2248 sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2192 approximately 3.288e-6 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] \u2248 3.288e-6 M. Then pOH = -log([OH^-]).\n\nlog(3.288e-6) is log(3.288) + log(1e-6). Log(3.288) is about 0.517, so pOH \u2248 5.483.\n\npH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 \u2248 8.517. So approximately 8.52.\n\nSo the second pH value is 8.52.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52 as the two pH values. So that should be the correct option.",
          "text2": "Wait, but wait\u2014did I compute the concentrations correctly?

So log(1/3) is -0.477, which gives pH=4.733 -0.477=4.256. So about 4.26. So the first part of the answer is 4.26.\n\nNow, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is the salt of a weak acid and a strong base. So the solution will be basic because acetate is a weak base.\n\nThe concentration of acetate at equivalence point: moles of acetate are 0.001 mol (same as initial moles of acetic acid). The total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 (original solution) + 10 cm\u00b3 (equivalence volume) = 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L.\n\nSo concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nThe acetate ion will hydrolyze in water:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for acetate can be calculated from Ka of acetic acid. Since Kw = Ka * Kb, so Kb = Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5.\n\nSo Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nThe acetate concentration is 0.02 M. We can set up the expression for Kb:\n\nKb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]\n\nAssuming x is the [OH^-], which will be small because Kb is small.\n\nSo:\n\nx^2 / (0.02 - x) \u2248 x^2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10.\n\nSo x^2 \u2248 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.\n\nx \u2248 sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] is about 1.04e-5 M.

At this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.
