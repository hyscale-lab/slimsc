Let's compute 6.6667 squared: 6.6667^2 \u2248 (20/3)^2 = 400/9 \u2248 44.444.\n\nSo 44.444 = 1/(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) \u2192 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1/44.444 \u2248 0.0225 \u2192 v\u00b2/c\u00b2 \u2248 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775 \u2192 v/c \u2248 sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. So v \u2248 0.9887 c.\n\nWow, that's a high velocity. So approximately 0.9887 times the speed of light. I'll keep that in mind.\n\nNow, the decay width \u0393 is given as 320 MeV. I remember that the decay width is related to the lifetime by \u0393 = \u0127 / \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.",
