So perhaps the mistake is in applying the velocity addition formula to the speed of light. Because the speed of light is invariant, it must remain c regardless of the frame. So this suggests that perhaps the velocity addition formula doesn't apply here, and the correct speed is c in the lab frame.\n\nSo this is confusing. Because according to the velocity addition formula, when u' is c/n, the resulting u would be (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which is option A. But according to relativity, u should be 1.\n\nSo which is correct?",
          "text2": "Wait, because earlier steps:\n\nWe had u' = [c (c +n v)] / (n c + v )\n\nSubstituting c=1, gives [1*(1 +n v)] / (n *1 + v) = (1 +n v)/(n +v )\n\nWhich is option A. So the speed of light is (1 + n v )/(n +v )",
