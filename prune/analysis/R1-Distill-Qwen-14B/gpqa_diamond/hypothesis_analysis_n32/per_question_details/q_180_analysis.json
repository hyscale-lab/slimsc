Hmm, but without knowing their mutual distances, how can we compute the potential energy between them?\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to approach this methodically.\n\nTotal potential energy U of the system is the sum of all individual pairs:\n\nU = U_fixed + U_12,\n\nwhere U_fixed is the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12, and U_12 is the potential energy between each pair of the 12.\n\nLet me compute each part.\n\nFirst, the fixed charge is at P. Each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P. So the potential energy between each pair (fixed and a 12th charge) is:\n\nU_single = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2m)",
