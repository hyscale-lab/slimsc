Quinuclidine is a molecule with a three-membered bridge, so the molecule is symmetric upon a 120-degree rotation. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If the molecule is symmetric across a plane that passes through the nitrogen and the opposite bridgehead, that would be a vertical plane, not horizontal. A horizontal plane would cut through the middle of the molecule, perhaps. But quinuclidine is a rigid structure; I'm not sure if it's symmetric across a horizontal plane. Probably not, because the substituents (like the hydrogen atoms) might not be arranged symmetrically across such a plane. So perhaps quinuclidine's point group is C3v, not C3h.\n\nSo, looking back at the options, let's think which ones have C3h symmetry.\n\nOption C: triisopropyl borate.

Because the three isopropyl groups are arranged symmetrically around the boron, and a horizontal plane through the middle would mirror the top and bottom, which are symmetrical because all substituents are the same.\n\nOption A and B are large, fused ring systems. Let me think about their structures. For option B, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran... So that's a benzo group fused to a trifuran. So it's a combination of a benzene ring and a system of three fused furan rings. The substituents are at 1,3,4,6,7,9. I'm not sure about the symmetry here. Benzo groups are planar, but having substituents at various positions might break the symmetry. Without seeing the structure, it's hard to tell. Similarly, option A has a triphenyleno group attached, so perhaps even more substituents, making it less likely to have high symmetry.\n\nOption D, quinuclidine, I'm less certain about. If it's chiral, it can't have a mirror plane, so its symmetry can't be C3h, which includes a horizontal mirror plane.

Quinuclidine is a molecule with a three-membered bridge, so the molecule is symmetric upon a 120-degree rotation. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If the molecule is symmetric across a plane that passes through the nitrogen and the opposite bridgehead, that would be a vertical plane, not horizontal. A horizontal plane would cut through the middle of the molecule, perhaps. But quinuclidine is a rigid structure; I'm not sure if it's symmetric across a horizontal plane.

Benzo groups are planar, but having substituents at various positions might break the symmetry. Without seeing the structure, it's hard to tell.
