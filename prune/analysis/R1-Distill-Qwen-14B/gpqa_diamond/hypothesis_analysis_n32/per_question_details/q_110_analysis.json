So when considering whether the star is bright enough, you just use that 15.5. So Star3's m_obs is 15.5, which is <=16, so HIRES can see it. And since m_obs is 15.5, it's also <=17, so ESPRESSO can see it. So Star3 is detectable by both.\n\nStar4: absolute V is 15.5, distance 10 pc. So apparent V is M +5 log(d/10)=15.5 +0=15.5. E(B-V)=0.4, so Av=3.1*0.4=1.24. So observed m_obs = m_true + Av =15.5 +1.24=16.74.\n\nSo the observed apparent V is 16.74. Now, HIRES can go up to 16. So 16.74 is higher than 16, so HIRES can't observe it. But ESPRESSO can, since 16.74 <17. So Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, not both.\n\nStar5: absolute V is 16.5, distance 5 pc. So apparent V is M +5 log(d/10). d=5, so log(5/10)=log(0.5)= -0.301. So 5* (-0.301)= -1.505. So m =16.5 + (-1.505)=14.995. So approximately 15.0.\n\nSo the apparent V is 15.0. No extinction given for Star5, so E(B-V)=0. Thus, m_obs is 15.0. So 15.0 <=16 (HIRES) and <=17 (ESPRESSO).

And since m_obs is 15.5, it's also <=17, so ESPRESSO can see it. So Star3 is detectable by both.\n\nStar4: absolute V is 15.5, distance 10 pc. So apparent V is M +5 log(d/10)=15.5 +0=15.5.

So mv = Mv +5 log(5/10) =16.5 +5 log(0.5). Log(0.5)= -0.3010, so 5*-0.3010= -1.505. So mv=16.5 -1.505=14.995\u224815.0. So mv=15.0. Star5 has no extinction mentioned, right? In the problem, Star5's description doesn't mention E(B-V), so I think it's zero. So mv=15.0. So for both spectrographs, 15.0 is \u226416 and \u226417, so both can detect it.

So when considering whether the star is bright enough, you just use that 15.5. So Star3's m_obs is 15.5, which is <=16, so HIRES can see it. And since m_obs is 15.5, it's also <=17, so ESPRESSO can see it. So Star3 is detectable by both.\n\nStar4: absolute V is 15.5, distance 10 pc. So apparent V is M +5 log(d/10)=15.5 +0=15.5. E(B-V)=0.4, so Av=3.1*0.4=1.24. So observed m_obs = m_true + Av =15.5 +1.24=16.74.\n\nSo the observed apparent V is 16.74. Now, HIRES can go up to 16. So 16.74 is higher than 16, so HIRES can't observe it. But ESPRESSO can, since 16.74 <17. So Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, not both.\n\nStar5: absolute V is 16.5, distance 5 pc. So apparent V is M +5 log(d/10). d=5, so log(5/10)=log(0.5)= -0.301. So 5* (-0.301)= -1.505. So m =16.5 + (-1.505)=14.995. So approximately 15.0.\n\nSo the apparent V is 15.0. No extinction given for Star5, so E(B-V)=0. Thus, m_obs is 15.0. So 15.0 <=16 (HIRES) and <=17 (ESPRESSO). So Star5 is detectable by both.\n\nNow, let's recap which stars are detectable by both:\n\nStar1: m_obs =15.5. Detectable by both.\n\nStar3: m_obs=15.5. Detectable by both.\n\nStar5: m_obs=15.0.
