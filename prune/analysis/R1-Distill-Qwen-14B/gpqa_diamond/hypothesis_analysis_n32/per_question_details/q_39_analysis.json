So the expression (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i is the wave function in that interval. But then, that's a complex function, which is fine because wave functions can be complex. But how does that help us find 'a'?\n\nOh right, the wave function must be normalized. So the integral of the square modulus of the wave function over all space must equal 1. Since the wave function is zero outside 1 and 3, we only integrate from 1 to 3.\n\nSo the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |\u03c8(x)|\u00b2 dx = 1.\n\nLet me write down \u03c8(x) as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is [ (a / sqrt(1+x))\u00b2 + (0.5)^2 ], because when you take the modulus of a complex number a + bi, it's sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2), so the square is a\u00b2 + b\u00b2.\n\nSo |\u03c8(x)|\u00b2 = (a\u00b2/(1+x)) + (0.25).\n\nSo the integral from 1 to 3 of [ a\u00b2/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.\n\nLet me compute this integral.\n\nFirst, split the integral into two parts:\n\nIntegral [a\u00b2/(1+x) dx] from 1 to3 + Integral [0.25 dx] from 1 to3 = 1.\n\nCompute each integral:\n\nIntegral of a\u00b2/(1+x) dx is a\u00b2 ln(1+x). Evaluated between 1 and 3: a\u00b2 [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a\u00b2 ln(2).\n\nIntegral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.\n\nSo adding both parts: a\u00b2 ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.\n\nSo a\u00b2 ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.\n\nThen a\u00b2 = 0.5 / ln(2).\n\nCompute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.\n\nSo 0.5 / 0.6931 \u2248 0.5 / 0.6931 \u2248 0.7213.\n\nSo a\u00b2 \u2248 0.7213 \u2192 a \u2248 sqrt(0.7213) \u2248 0.849.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 0.85.

So the modulus squared is [ (a / sqrt(1+x))\u00b2 + (0.5)^2 ], because when you take the modulus of a complex number a + bi, it's sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2), so the square is a\u00b2 + b\u00b2.\n\nSo |\u03c8(x)|\u00b2 = (a\u00b2/(1+x)) + (0.25).\n\nSo the integral from 1 to 3 of [ a\u00b2/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.\n\nLet me compute this integral.\n\nFirst, split the integral into two parts:\n\nIntegral [a\u00b2/(1+x) dx] from 1 to3 + Integral [0.25 dx] from 1 to3 = 1.\n\nCompute each integral:\n\nIntegral of a\u00b2/(1+x) dx is a\u00b2 ln(1+x).
