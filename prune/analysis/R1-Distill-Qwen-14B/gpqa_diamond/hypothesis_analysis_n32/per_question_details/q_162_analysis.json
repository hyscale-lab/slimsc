So sqrt(det g) is g. Therefore, the area element dA is g dx dy.\n\nSo in this case, dA = [32 / (4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)] dx dy.\n\nThe area of the entire space would be the integral of dA over all x and y such that x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 <4. Because the metric is defined only where 4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 >0, so the domain is the disk of radius 2.\n\nSo the area A would be the double integral over this disk of [32/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)] dx dy.\n\nHmm, that integral seems a bit tricky. Maybe I should switch to polar coordinates because of the circular symmetry. In polar coordinates, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = r\u00b2, and dx dy becomes r dr d\u03b8.\n\nSo the integral becomes: \u222b (\u03b8 from 0 to 2\u03c0) \u222b (r from 0 to 2) [32/(4 - r\u00b2)] * r dr d\u03b8.\n\nLet me compute this. First, factor out the constants. The 32 and the r and dr terms. The integral over \u03b8 is straightforward.\n\nSo the integral is 32 * \u222b0^{2\u03c0} d\u03b8 * \u222b0^2 [r / (4 - r\u00b2)] dr.\n\nCompute the \u03b8 integral first: \u222b0^{2\u03c0} d\u03b8 = 2\u03c0.\n\nSo now it's 32 * 2\u03c0 * \u222b0^2 [r / (4 - r\u00b2)] dr.",

But I think in this case, since it's a 2D metric, and the area is being asked, I just need to compute the integral of the area element over the allowed region.\n\nSo the area A would be the double integral over x and y of (32)/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) dx dy, with x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 < 4.\n\nHmm, to compute this, it might be easier to switch to polar coordinates. Let me do that. So, x = r cos\u03b8, y = r sin\u03b8, and dx dy = r dr d\u03b8.\n\nSubstituting into the area element:\n\nA = \u222b\u222b [32/(4 - r\u00b2)] * r dr d\u03b8.\n\nThe limits for r would be from 0 to 2, because x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = r\u00b2 must be less than 4. And \u03b8 goes from 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\nSo A = \u222b (\u03b8=0 to 2\u03c0) \u222b (r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r\u00b2)] dr d\u03b8.\n\nI can separate the integrals since the integrand doesn't depend on \u03b8:\n\nA = (32) * \u222b (0 to 2\u03c0) d\u03b8 * \u222b (0 to 2) [ r / (4 - r\u00b2) ] dr.\n\nCompute the \u03b8 integral first: \u222b0^2\u03c0 d\u03b8 = 2\u03c0.\n\nSo A = 32 * 2\u03c0 * \u222b (0 to 2) [ r / (4 - r\u00b2) ] dr.\n\nNow, compute the r integral: \u222b r/(4 - r\u00b2) dr.\n\nLet me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r\u00b2, so du/dr = -2r. So (-1/2) du = r dr.\n\nSo the integral becomes \u222b (r dr) / (4 - r\u00b2) = \u222b (-1/2) du / u = (-1/2) ln|u| + C.\n\nEvaluating from r=0 to r=2:\n\nAt r=2, u=4 - (2)^2 = 0.",

The metric is usually written as ds\u00b2 = (4/(a\u00b2(1 - r\u00b2)^2)) (dr\u00b2 + r\u00b2 d\u03b8\u00b2), where r is the radial coordinate in the disk, and a is the radius of the disk. The curvature is negative, and the magnitude is ( -1/a\u00b2 ). So in this case, the metric given is (32)/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) (dx\u00b2 + dy\u00b2). Let me express it in polar coordinates. Let x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = r\u00b2, so denominator is (4 - r\u00b2). So the metric becomes (32)/(4 - r\u00b2) (dr\u00b2 + r\u00b2 d\u03b8\u00b2).",

Which is sqrt( [32/(4 - r\u00b2)] * [32 r\u00b2/(4 - r\u00b2)] ) dr d\u03b8. Inside the sqrt, that's (32 * 32 r\u00b2 )/(4 - r\u00b2)^2 ) = (1024 r\u00b2)/(4 - r\u00b2)^2. The square root of that is (32 r)/(4 - r\u00b2). So the area element is (32 r)/(4 - r\u00b2) dr d\u03b8.\n\nSo the area A is the integral over r and \u03b8.

So the product is (32 * 32 r\u00b2) / (4 - r\u00b2)^2, so sqrt of that is (32 r) / (4 - r\u00b2).\n\nSo the area element is [32 r/(4 - r\u00b2)] dr d\u03b8.

Since e^{2\u03c6} = 32/(4 - r\u00b2), where r\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2. Taking the natural log: 2\u03c6 = ln(32/(4 - r\u00b2)) = ln(32) - ln(4 - r\u00b2).

The square root of that is (32 r)/(4 - r\u00b2). So the area element is (32 r)/(4 - r\u00b2) dr d\u03b8.\n\nSo the area A is the integral over r and \u03b8. Since the problem is asking for a pseudosphere of radius r=2, I think we're integrating up to r=2. So the limits would be r from 0 to 2, \u03b8 from 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\nSo A = \u222b (from \u03b8=0 to 2\u03c0) \u222b (from r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r\u00b2)] dr d\u03b8.\n\nLet me compute the inner integral first. Let\u2019s compute \u222b [32 r/(4 - r\u00b2)] dr from 0 to 2.\n\nLet\u2019s do substitution: let u =4 - r\u00b2. Then du/dr = -2r \u2192 -du/2 = r dr. So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=4 - (4)=0.\n\nSo the integral becomes \u222b [32/(u)] * (-du/2) from u=4 to u=0.\n\nWhich is [32 * (-1/2) ) ] \u222b (1/u) du from 4 to 0.\n\nThe integral of (1/u) du is ln|u|.

Since g_r\u03b8 is zero, it's sqrt(g_rr * g_\u03b8\u03b8). So in our case, g_rr = 32/(4 - r\u00b2), and g_\u03b8\u03b8 = [32 r\u00b2]/(4 - r\u00b2). So the product is (32 * 32 r\u00b2) / (4 - r\u00b2)^2, so sqrt of that is (32 r) / (4 - r\u00b2).\n\nSo the area element is [32 r/(4 - r\u00b2)] dr d\u03b8. Therefore, to find the total area, we integrate this over the region of r and \u03b8.\n\nWhat are the limits of r? Since the denominator is 4 - r\u00b2, it must be positive, so r\u00b2 <4 \u2192 r < 2. So r goes from 0 to 2. \u03b8 goes from 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\nSo the area A is the integral from r=0 to 2, and \u03b8=0 to 2\u03c0 of [32 r/(4 - r\u00b2)] dr d\u03b8.\n\nSince the integrand doesn't depend on \u03b8, the integral over \u03b8 will just multiply by 2\u03c0. So:\n\nA = \u222b (from 0 to 2\u03c0) d\u03b8 \u222b (from 0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r\u00b2)] dr\n\n= 2\u03c0 * \u222b (0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r\u00b2)] dr\n\nLet me compute the integral \u222b [32 r / (4 - r\u00b2)] dr from 0 to 2.\n\nHmm, substitution perhaps. Let u = 4 - r\u00b2; then du/dr = -2r \u2192 - (du/2) = r dr.\n\nSo the integral becomes \u222b [32 r dr ]/(4 - r\u00b2) = 32 \u222b [r dr]/(4 - r\u00b2) = 32 * \u222b [ - (du/2) ] / u",
