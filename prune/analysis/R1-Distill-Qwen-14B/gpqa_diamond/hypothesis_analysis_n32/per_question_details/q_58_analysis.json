But that doesn't necessarily mean it doesn't have divergences. Regularization is a necessary step in handling loop integrals, so I think QCD does require regularization. Although, because it's asymptotically free, maybe the divergences are less severe? Or perhaps it's only superrenormalizable? No, QCD is a non-superrenormalizable theory because it's a four-dimensional theory with a dimensionless coupling, which leads to needing an infinite number of counterterms. So yeah, QCD definitely uses regularization.\n\nOption C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, and it's a well-understood theory.

Some sources say that string theory might not need renormalization because the divergences cancel out, but I'm not certain about regularization.\n\nOption B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD has a property called asymptotic freedom, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes small, so perturbative methods work. But even so, I think QCD does require renormalization. Because in dealing with loop diagrams, you get divergences, so you have to regularize them.

QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established quantum field theory. I remember that QED calculations, like the electron self-energy, lead to divergences.

QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that at low energies, QCD is non-perturbative, which is why things like quark confinement happen. But at high energies (or equivalently, at short distances), QCD becomes weakly coupled because of asymptotic freedom. So QCD calculations at high energies are manageable.

So perhaps the correct answer is D.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit torn between A and D. Let me think about what the question is really asking. It's about whether the theory ever requires regularization when you go to high energies. So which theory doesn't have high-energy divergences, thus not needing regularization.\n\nIf string theory manages to avoid UV divergences, then it would be the correct answer. But I'm not entirely confident.",

Oh, right, but that's more of a conceptual issue and not handled by regularization. So perhaps in the context of regularization, which is a quantum field theory tool, classical theories wouldn't require it. So D might be the right answer.\n\nBut let me go through the other options too to make sure.\n\nOption A is Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a theory that tries to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. Since it's a theory of quantum gravity, it might have issues with divergences, but wait, string theory is supposed to be finite, right? Or does it still require regularization? I'm a bit fuzzy here. I remember that in string theory, the interactions are handled by the string worldsheet and that it doesn't suffer from the same divergences as point-particle theories because of the way the interactions are regulated. So maybe superstring theory doesn't require regularization. But I'm not entirely sure. So this could be a candidate.\n\nOption B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory and has asymptotic freedom. I know that in QCD, calculations can lead to divergences, especially in loop diagrams. So they must use regularization methods like dimensional regularization or lattice regularization to handle those infinities. So B definitely requires regularization.\n\nOption C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism and is a well-understood quantum field theory. When you calculate things like the electron self-energy or the photon vacuum polarization, you get divergent integrals. To handle these, you use regularization techniques like cutoff regularization, dimensional regularization, or others. So QED does require regularization. So option C is not the answer.\n\nSo, the options are A, D. Now I need to decide between them.",
