So when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher.

Let's denote R1 as the ratio when there are no spots (T1=6000K), and R2 as the ratio when there are spots (T2=5500K). So the factor is R1 / R2.\n\nAssuming that the statistical weights g2 and g1 are the same for both scenarios, because those are intrinsic to the energy levels and don't change with temperature. So g2/g1 is a constant factor in both R1 and R2.\n\nSo R1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T1) )\nR2 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T2) )\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp( [ (E2 - E1)/(k) ) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] )",

So without spots, the ratio is higher than with spots.\n\nBut the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes.

So as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, because (E2-E1)/(k T) increases (since T is smaller, same numerator). So exp(-x) with larger x is smaller, meaning the entire ratio n1/n2 would decrease when T decreases. Which matches the problem statement.\n\nSo the ratio without spots is higher than with spots.

But according to the problem, when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio is lower. So that contradicts the formula.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I have the energy levels mixed up. Maybe E1 is higher than E2. Because if E1 is higher than E2, then (E2 - E1) is negative. So, in that case, (E2-E1) = - (E1-E2). So, the ratio becomes n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E1-E2)/(k T) )\n\nSo, if E1 > E2, then (E1-E2) is positive. So, when T increases, the exponent (- (E1-E2)/(k T) ) becomes a smaller negative number, so the exponential becomes larger. So, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T) )",

Let the fraction of the surface covered by spots be f (0.4), and the rest (1-f) is at the normal temperature T1 (6000 K). The spotted regions are at T2 (which I need to find). The total luminosity L is then L = 4\u03c0R\u00b2 [ (1-f) \u03c3 T1^4 + f \u03c3 T2^4 ].\n\nThe effective temperature, T_eff, is such that L = 4\u03c0 R\u00b2 \u03c3 T_eff^4. So,\n\n(1-f) T1^4 + f T2^4 = T_eff^4.\n\nWe can plug in the values. f = 0.4, T1=6000 K, T_eff=5500 K.\n\nSo,\n\n0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(T2)^4 = (5500)^4.\n\nLet me compute each term. 6000^4 is (6e3)^4 = 6^4 *1e12 = 1296e12.

So when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher. So the question is, by what factor does the ratio without spots exceed the ratio with spots.\n\nThe ratio change factor is R_no_spots / R_with_spots. Let's denote R1 as the ratio when there are no spots (T1=6000K), and R2 as the ratio when there are spots (T2=5500K). So the factor is R1 / R2.\n\nAssuming that the statistical weights g2 and g1 are the same for both scenarios, because those are intrinsic to the energy levels and don't change with temperature. So g2/g1 is a constant factor in both R1 and R2.\n\nSo R1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T1) )\nR2 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T2) )\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp( [ (E2 - E1)/(k) ) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] )",
          "text2": "But wait, the ratio is n1/n2, and when the temperature decreases, what happens to this ratio? Let's think about E2 - E1. Let's say E2 is higher than E1 because the transition is from a lower to higher energy level. So the exponential term would be exp( -\u0394E/(kT) ), where \u0394E = E2 - E1.\n\nIf T decreases, then (\u0394E)/(kT) increases, which makes the exponential term smaller. So, if the temperature goes down, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. That's consistent with the problem statement, which says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So without spots, the ratio is higher than with spots.\n\nBut the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes. So, we need to compute (n1/n2)_unspotted / (n1/n2)_spotted.\n\nBut for that, we can model it with the Boltzmann equation. Let me denote the ratio as R = (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -\u0394E/(kT) ). Since g1 and g2 are constants (statistical weights), when taking the ratio R_unspotted / R_spotted, the g factors will cancel out. So the factor is exp( [\u0394E/(k T_spotted)] - [\u0394E/(k T_unspotted)] ) = exp( \u0394E/(k) (1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted) ) ).",
