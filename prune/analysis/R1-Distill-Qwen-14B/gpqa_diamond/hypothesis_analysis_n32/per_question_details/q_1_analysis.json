Maybe I should calculate the energy uncertainty for each state and then see what the minimum \u0394E between E1 and E2 needs to be.\n\nSo, let's do that. The lifetimes are \u03c41 = 1e-9 seconds and \u03c42 = 1e-8 seconds. Assuming \u0127 is approximately 1.055e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nSo, for E1: \u0394E1 = \u0127 / \u03c41 = (1.055e-34) / (1e-9) = 1.055e-25 J. To convert that into eV, since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, we divide by that. So 1.055e-25 / 1.602e-19 \u2248 6.58e-7 eV.",

Hmm, not entirely sure. Let me think.\n\nSo for state 1, \u03c41 is 1e-9 sec. So \u0394E1 is \u0127/(2\u03c41). Similarly, for state 2, \u0394E2 is \u0127/(2\u03c42).

Because if E2 and E1 are too close, their energies would be within each other's uncertainties, making them hard to distinguish.\n\nSo, the energy difference should be greater than \u0394E1 + \u0394E2, perhaps? Let's compute that.\n\n\u0394E1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, \u0394E2 is 6.58e-8 eV. So sum is approximately 7.238e-7 eV.",
