The conditions suggest ozonolysis followed by reductive workup, which typically cleaves the ozonides into carbonyl compounds. So product 3 would be the cleavage products of the double bond.\n\nNow, the question is about the 1H NMR of product 3. Specifically, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding exchangeables).\n\nSo, to figure this out, I need to determine the structure of product 3.\n\nLet me try to reconstruct the steps:\n\n1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane \u2192 product 1 (1,3-adamantanedione) via KOH elimination.\n\n2. Product 1 treated with Al(OiPr)3 \u2192 product 2. Perhaps product 2 is the enol ether or an aldol adduct with a double bond.\n\n3. Ozonolysis of product 2 gives product 3, which has carbonyl groups.\n\nSo, product 2 has a double bond, and ozonolysis cleaves it into two carbonyl groups.",
