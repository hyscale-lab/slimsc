The transit probability also depends on the inclination of the orbit, but since the RV method already detects the planet, which requires a high enough inclination (so that the RV method can see the Doppler shift), but for the transit probability, the RV method only tells us that the planet's orbit is aligned to some degree. However, in this question, the RV method has already detected the planet, which means that the orbit must have an inclination high enough to cause the Doppler shift. So the prior probability for the transit is conditional on the planet's existence, but perhaps the RV method gives a minimum mass, but for the transit probability, we're considering the probability given that the planet exists. No, wait, the transit probability is the geometric probability, which depends on the inclination. But the RV method is sensitive to planets with higher inclinations (closer to 90 degrees), so perhaps the prior for the transit is not the same as for planets discovered by other methods.",

Oh, the problem says, \"both have the same radii.\" So R1 = R2.\n\nSo for a planet, the transit probability is higher when the semi-major axis a is smaller. Because P is proportional to (R_star / a). So if a is smaller, the probability is higher.\n\nSo let's find a for each planet.\n\nWe can use Kepler's third law to find a. The version for a planet around a star is:\n\na^3 = (G (M_star) P^2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nBut since we're comparing two planets, perhaps we can find the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\nFor Planet_1 and Planet_2:\n\nP1 = (P2) / 3.\n\nBecause Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's.

So the probability depends inversely on a. So the planet with the smaller semi-major axis (a) has a higher probability of transiting.\n\nSo which planet has a smaller a? Since the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's, using Kepler's third law, a^3 is proportional to (P^2)(M_star).

So Planet_1 has higher probability.\n\nSo the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1 because it's more likely to transit. So the correct option would be either C or D. But according to our calculation, it's about 1.65 times higher.\n\nSo the answer should be C.",
          "text2": "Wait, let me double-check. Because P_transit of Planet_1 is (R/a1), and P_transit of Planet_2 is (R/a2) = (R)/(1.65 a1) = (1/1.65) (R/a1) \u2248 0.606 (R/a1). So P1 is (R/a1) vs. P2 is 0.606 (R/a1). So P1 is higher by a factor of about 1.65.\n\nSo the probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times that of Planet_2. So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1 because it has a higher probability. Therefore, the correct option should be C or D.",
