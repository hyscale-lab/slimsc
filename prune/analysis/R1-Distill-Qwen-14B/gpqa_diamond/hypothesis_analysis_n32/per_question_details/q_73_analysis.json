I think the total energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts.

Each astronaut's energy is gamma * m c\u00b2, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nSo for the first astronaut, mass 2m, moving at 0.6c.

So u is B's velocity (0.5c), and v is A's velocity (0.6c). So yes, that calculation is correct. So the relative speed is (0.5 - 0.6)/(1 - (0.5 * 0.6)) c. So that's -0.1 / (1 - 0.3) ) = -0.1 / 0.7 c, which is about -0.1428c. So the magnitude is about 0.143c, which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c.

So in this case, since the second astronaut is moving slower in the same direction, the relative speed is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c\u00b2) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 \u2248 -0.1428c.

The relativistic energy is given by gamma * m c\u00b2, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nSo for the first astronaut, mass 2m, velocity 0.6c.

I think the total energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts.

Each astronaut's energy is gamma * m c\u00b2, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nSo for the first astronaut, mass 2m, moving at 0.6c.

So u is B's velocity (0.5c), and v is A's velocity (0.6c). So yes, that calculation is correct. So the relative speed is (0.5 - 0.6)/(1 - (0.5 * 0.6)) c.

So in this case, since the second astronaut is moving slower in the same direction, the relative speed is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c\u00b2) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 \u2248 -0.1428c.

The relativistic energy is given by gamma * m c\u00b2, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nSo for the first astronaut, mass 2m, velocity 0.6c.

So I'll compute each astronaut's energy and sum them.\n\nStarting with the first astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.\n\nGamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) \u2192 v=0.6c, so v\u00b2=0.36c\u00b2. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64 \u2192 sqrt(0.64) is 0.8.

I think the total energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts.

Each astronaut's energy is gamma * m c\u00b2, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nSo for the first astronaut, mass 2m, moving at 0.6c.

So u is B's velocity (0.5c), and v is A's velocity (0.6c). So yes, that calculation is correct. So the relative speed is (0.5 - 0.6)/(1 - (0.5 * 0.6)) c. So that's -0.1 / (1 - 0.3) ) = -0.1 / 0.7 c, which is about -0.1428c. So the magnitude is about 0.143c, which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c.

So option C's energy is correct.\n\nNow, let's check the options again:\n\nOption C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc\u00b2. That matches both the relative speed and the total energy.\n\nOption D: v_rel=0.14c, E=5 mc\u00b2. The energy here is way off, so it's incorrect.",

So in this case, since the second astronaut is moving slower in the same direction, the relative speed is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c\u00b2) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 \u2248 -0.1428c. So the magnitude is 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c. So that narrows it down to options C and D.\n\nNow, the total energy of the system. Hmm, total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy is given by gamma * m c\u00b2, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nSo for the first astronaut, mass 2m, velocity 0.6c. Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c\u00b2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So u is B's velocity (0.5c), and v is A's velocity (0.6c). So yes, that calculation is correct. So the relative speed is (0.5 - 0.6)/(1 - (0.5 * 0.6)) c. So that's -0.1 / (1 - 0.3) ) = -0.1 / 0.7 c, which is about -0.1428c. So the magnitude is about 0.143c, which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have this.\n\nNow, the second part is calculating the total energy of the system. So total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c\u00b2, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)).\n\nSo for astronaut A (2m, v=0.6c):\n\nGamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2)\n= 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)\n= 1 / sqrt(0.64)\n= 1/0.8\n= 1.25\n\nSo E_A = gamma_A * 2m * c\u00b2 = 1.25 * 2m c\u00b2 = 2.5 m c\u00b2.\n\nFor astronaut B (3m, v=0.5c):\n\nGamma_B = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2)\n= 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25)\n= 1 / sqrt(0.75)\n= 1 / (\u221a(3/4)) )\n= 1 / ( (\u221a3)/2 )\n= 2/\u221a3 \u2248 1.1547\n\nSo E_B = gamma_B * 3m c\u00b2 \u2248 1.1547 * 3 m c\u00b2 \u2248 3.464 m c\u00b2.\n\nSo the total energy E_total = E_A + E_B = 2.5 + 3.464 = approximately 5.964 m c\u00b2. So that's about 5.96 mc\u00b2. Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc\u00b2, and option B says E=4.96 mc\u00b2. So option C's energy is correct.\n\nNow, let's check the options again:\n\nOption C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc\u00b2. That matches both the relative speed and the total energy.\n\nOption D: v_rel=0.14c, E=5 mc\u00b2. The energy here is way off, so it's incorrect.",
          "text2": "Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the formula. I think the correct formula when you're finding the velocity of an object moving at v in the lab frame from the perspective of someone moving at u in the lab frame is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c\u00b2). So in this case, since the second astronaut is moving slower in the same direction, the relative speed is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c\u00b2) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 \u2248 -0.1428c. So the magnitude is 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c. So that narrows it down to options C and D.\n\nNow, the total energy of the system. Hmm, total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy is given by gamma * m c\u00b2, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nSo for the first astronaut, mass 2m, velocity 0.6c. Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c\u00b2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c\u00b2 = 1.25 * 2m c\u00b2 = 2.5 m c\u00b2.\n\nSecond astronaut, mass 3m, velocity 0.5c. Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) \u2248 1.1547. So E2 = gamma2 *3m c\u00b2 = 1.1547 *3 \u2248 3.464 m c\u00b2.\n\nAdding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 \u2248 5.964 m c\u00b2. So approximately 5.96 m c\u00b2. Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc\u00b2, and option D says 5mc\u00b2. So the total energy is about 5.96 mc\u00b2, which points to option C.",

So the numerator is -0.1c.\n\nDenominator: 1 - (0.3c\u00b2)/(c\u00b2) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.\n\nSo u' = (-0.1c) / 0.7 = approximately -0.1429c, which is about -0.14c.",

I think the correct formula when you're finding the velocity of an object moving at v in the lab frame from the perspective of someone moving at u in the lab frame is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c\u00b2). So in this case, since the second astronaut is moving slower in the same direction, the relative speed is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c\u00b2) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 \u2248 -0.1428c.

The relativistic energy is given by gamma * m c\u00b2, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nSo for the first astronaut, mass 2m, velocity 0.6c.

Each astronaut's energy is gamma * m c\u00b2, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nSo for the first astronaut, mass 2m, moving at 0.6c.

So u is B's velocity (0.5c), and v is A's velocity (0.6c). So yes, that calculation is correct. So the relative speed is (0.5 - 0.6)/(1 - (0.5 * 0.6)) c. So that's -0.1 / (1 - 0.3) ) = -0.1 / 0.7 c, which is about -0.1428c. So the magnitude is about 0.143c, which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c.

The relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c\u00b2, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)).\n\nSo for astronaut A (2m, v=0.6c):\n\nGamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2)\n= 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)\n= 1 / sqrt(0.64)\n= 1/0.8\n= 1.25\n\nSo E_A = gamma_A * 2m * c\u00b2 = 1.25 * 2m c\u00b2 = 2.5 m c\u00b2.\n\nFor astronaut B (3m, v=0.5c):\n\nGamma_B = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2)\n= 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25)\n= 1 / sqrt(0.75)\n= 1 / (\u221a(3/4)) )\n= 1 / ( (\u221a3)/2 )\n= 2/\u221a3 \u2248 1.1547\n\nSo E_B = gamma_B * 3m c\u00b2 \u2248 1.1547 * 3 m c\u00b2 \u2248 3.464 m c\u00b2.\n\nSo the total energy E_total = E_A + E_B = 2.5 + 3.464 = approximately 5.964 m c\u00b2.

So option C's energy is correct.\n\nNow, let's check the options again:\n\nOption C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc\u00b2. That matches both the relative speed and the total energy.\n\nOption D: v_rel=0.14c, E=5 mc\u00b2. The energy here is way off, so it's incorrect.",

I think the correct formula when you're finding the velocity of an object moving at v in the lab frame from the perspective of someone moving at u in the lab frame is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c\u00b2). So in this case, since the second astronaut is moving slower in the same direction, the relative speed is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c\u00b2) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 \u2248 -0.1428c. So the magnitude is 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c. So that narrows it down to options C and D.\n\nNow, the total energy of the system. Hmm, total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy is given by gamma * m c\u00b2, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nSo for the first astronaut, mass 2m, velocity 0.6c. Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c\u00b2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

Rounded to three significant figures, that's about 5.96 m c\u00b2.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc\u00b2 and v_rel=0.14c. Option B has E=4.96, which is lower.

So u is B's velocity (0.5c), and v is A's velocity (0.6c). So yes, that calculation is correct. So the relative speed is (0.5 - 0.6)/(1 - (0.5 * 0.6)) c.

So in this case, since the second astronaut is moving slower in the same direction, the relative speed is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c\u00b2) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 \u2248 -0.1428c.
