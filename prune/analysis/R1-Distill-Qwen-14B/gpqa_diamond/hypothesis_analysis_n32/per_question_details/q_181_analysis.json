So if the CNO neutrinos are in the higher end of the 700-800 keV band, then stopping pp-III wouldn't affect it, but if pp-III neutrinos are in the 800-900 keV, then their stopping would reduce the flux in band 2.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here because I'm not exactly sure about the energy ranges of the neutrinos from each process. Let me try to find another approach.\n\nThe question is about the ratio of fluxes in two bands after the pp-III stops. The key is that the pp-III produces higher-energy neutrinos than the pp-I. So if pp-III stops, the higher energy bands (like band 2) would see a drop in flux, while lower bands (band 1) would remain the same.\n\nAssuming that the majority of neutrinos in band 1 come from pp-I, and band 2 comes from pp-III, then the flux in band 2 would drop. So the ratio (band1 / band2) would be higher than 1.\n\nBut the options are A)10, B)0.01, C)1, D)0.1.\n\nIf pp-III contributes significantly to band 2, then the flux in band 2 would drop, making the ratio (band1/band2) increase. If band1's flux is the same and band2's is lower, the ratio is higher than 1.\n\nBut what's the typical ratio of neutrinos from pp-I and pp-III in these bands?",

After stopping, band 2 would only have the pp-I/II contributions, which are smaller than before.\n\nSo the flux in band 2 would drop to a lower value, but band 1 remains the same (assuming pp-I and II contribute to band 1 as before).

The pp-II branch involves the capture of a proton by a deuteron: D + p \u2192 T + e+ + \u03bd_e. The triton then captures another proton to form He-4. So the neutrino in the pp-II branch comes from the D + p \u2192 T + e+ + \u03bd_e reaction. The energy of these neutrinos is higher than the pp-I ones because the mass difference is larger.

I'm not too sure about the exact numbers, but I think the pp-II neutrinos are higher energy than the pp-I.\n\nThe pp-III branch is a less common branch where a proton captures a helium-3 nucleus. So, in the pp-III branch, a proton and He-3 combine to form Be-7. Then, Be-7 captures a proton to form B-8, which is unstable and decays into C-8, emitting a neutrino.
