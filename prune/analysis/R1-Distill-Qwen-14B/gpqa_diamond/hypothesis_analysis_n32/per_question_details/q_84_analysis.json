Stability is crucial in numerical methods, but I'm not sure if it's the key factor here for converting to a parallel algorithm.

Hmm, Pad\u00e9 approximants are rational functions, and their denominators and numerators are polynomials. The roots of these polynomials could be complex. If the approximation has complex roots, how does that affect parallel splitting?
