Then P_x's (1,1) is 0, so the (1,1) element of P_n is n_z*(1) * (\u0127/2).\n- The (1,2) element is n_x from P_x, which is 1 in the first row, multiplied by (\u0127/2).\nSimilarly, the (2,1) element is n_x*(\u0127/2), and (2,2) is -n_z*(\u0127/2).\n\nSo P_n is:\n[[ (n_z \u0127/2), (n_x \u0127/2) ],\n [ (n_x \u0127/2), ( -n_z \u0127/2 ) ] ]\n\nNow, the eigenvalue equation is (P_n - \u03bb I) |v> = 0, where \u03bb is the eigenvalue.

So:\n\nsin\u03b8 \u03c3_x = [[0, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, 0]]\ncos\u03b8 \u03c3_z = [[cos\u03b8, 0], [0, -cos\u03b8]]\nSo adding them together:\n[[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]]\n\nMultiply by \u0127/2, so the matrix P is:\n\n(\u0127/2) * [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]]\n\nSo now, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +\u0127/2. So let's set up the eigenvalue equation: P |v> = (\u0127/2) |v>",
          "text2": "Wait, but the problem states that n lies in the x-z plane. That might mean that the direction is parameterized by an angle \u03b8 from the z-axis, so n would be (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8) in x, y, z. So the operator becomes P = (\u0127/2)(sin\u03b8 \u03c3_x + cos\u03b8 \u03c3_z).\n\nSo the matrix for P would be (\u0127/2) times [ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] because \u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]] and \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So when you add sin\u03b8 \u03c3_x and cos\u03b8 \u03c3_z, you get [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8],[sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]]. Multiplying by \u0127/2 gives the full operator.\n\nSo we're looking for eigenvectors of this matrix with eigenvalue +\u0127/2.

So the spherical angles would have \u03c6=0. So the direction vector is (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), but wait, wait, no. Because in spherical coordinates, \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. So when \u03c6 is 0, you're pointing along the x direction. When \u03c6 is \u03c0/2, you're in the y direction, but here, the direction is in the x-z plane, so \u03c6 is either 0 or \u03c0. Let's say \u03c6=0 for simplicity.\n\nSo the operator P has components along x, y, and z. But in this case, since we're looking along an arbitrary direction n in x-z, the operator we need is P\u00b7n, which is the projection of P along n. So the operator we're interested in is P\u00b7n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z.\n\nSince n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P\u00b7n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.\n\nGiven that n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1.

So:\n\nsin\u03b8 \u03c3_x = [[0, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, 0]]\ncos\u03b8 \u03c3_z = [[cos\u03b8, 0], [0, -cos\u03b8]]\nSo adding them together:\n[[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]]\n\nMultiply by \u0127/2, so the matrix P is:\n\n(\u0127/2) * [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]]\n\nSo now, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +\u0127/2. So let's set up the eigenvalue equation: P |v> = (\u0127/2) |v>",
          "text2": "Wait, but the problem states that n lies in the x-z plane. That might mean that the direction is parameterized by an angle \u03b8 from the z-axis, so n would be (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8) in x, y, z. So the operator becomes P = (\u0127/2)(sin\u03b8 \u03c3_x + cos\u03b8 \u03c3_z).\n\nSo the matrix for P would be (\u0127/2) times [ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] because \u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]] and \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So when you add sin\u03b8 \u03c3_x and cos\u03b8 \u03c3_z, you get [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8],[sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]]. Multiplying by \u0127/2 gives the full operator.\n\nSo we're looking for eigenvectors of this matrix with eigenvalue +\u0127/2.

We're looking for \u03bb = +\u0127/2.\n\nSo subtract (\u0127/2) I from P_n:\n\nP_n - (\u0127/2) I = [[ (n_z \u0127/2 - \u0127/2 ), (n_x \u0127/2) ],\n                [ (n_x \u0127/2 ), ( -n_z \u0127/2 - \u0127/2 ) ] ]\n\nFactor out \u0127/2:\n\n= (\u0127/2) [ [n_z -1, n_x ],\n           [n_x, (-n_z -1) ] ]\n\nSo the matrix becomes:\n[ [n_z -1, n_x], \n  [n_x, -n_z -1] ]\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector for this matrix, which corresponds to the eigenvalue equation.\n\nThe eigenvector v = [a, b]^T, and when we apply the matrix to v, it should give zero.\n\nSo, the equations are:\n\n(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0\nn_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0\n\nThese are two equations. Let me write them:\n\n1. (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0\n2. n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0\n\nI can write these as a system:\n\n(n_z -1) a = -n_x b  --> equation (1)\nn_x a = (n_z +1 ) b  --> equation (2)\n\nLet me solve for a and b.\n\nFrom equation (1): a = [ -n_x / (n_z - 1) ] b\n\nBut let's substitute a from equation (1) into equation (2).\n\nn_x [ (-n_x / (n_z -1) ) b ] = (n_z + 1) b\n\nLeft side: ( -n_x^2 / (n_z -1) ) b \nRight side: (n_z +1 ) b\n\nDivide both sides by b (assuming b \u2260 0, which it can't be because then a would be zero, leading to a trivial solution).\n\nSo:\n\n- n_x^2 / (n_z - 1) = (n_z + 1)\n\nMultiply both sides by (n_z -1):\n\n- n_x^2 = (n_z +1)(n_z -1)\n= n_z^2 -1\n\nSo:\n\n- n_x^2 = n_z^2 -1\nWhich rearranges to:\n\nn_z^2 + n_x^2 = 1.\n\nWhich is correct because n is a unit vector, so n_x\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2 =1. So that's consistent.\n\nSo, now I can express a in terms of b. Let's take equation (1):\n\na = [ -n_x / (n_z - 1) ] b",

So the eigenvector would be [0, 1], which is the spin-down state, but wait, no, because the eigenvalue is +\u0127/2, so along negative z, the spin-up direction would correspond to the eigenvector [0,1], because the spin operator along negative z would have eigenvalues +\u0127/2 and -\u0127/2. So in that case, if theta is pi, the direction is along -z, and the eigenvector would be [0,1], which matches our result.\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So the vector is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ).\n\nLooking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).",
