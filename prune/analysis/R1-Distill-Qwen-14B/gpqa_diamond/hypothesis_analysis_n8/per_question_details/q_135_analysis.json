Their masses are around a few MeV, which is much less than a GeV. So 6 GeV is way more than enough for them. Then, the strange quark is about 100 MeV, which is also much less. The charm quark is about 1.5 GeV. So twice that is 3 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into c c-bar.\n\nThe bottom quark is heavier. Its mass is around 4.5 GeV. So twice that is 9 GeV. Since X is 6 GeV, which is less than 9, it can't decay into b b-bar. Because 6 < 9. So the decay into b quarks is not allowed. Similarly, the top quark is way too heavy, around 173 GeV, so no way X can decay into t t-bar.\n\nWhat about leptons? The electron is about 0.5 MeV, so way under. The muon is around 0.1 GeV (105.7 MeV), so 2 * 0.1 is 0.2 GeV, which is much less than 6. So X can decay into mu+ mu-.\n\nTau lepton is about 1.78 GeV. So twice that is 3.56 GeV. Is 3.56 less than 6? Yes, so X can decay into tau+ tau-.",

The top quark is the heaviest, but it's like around 173 GeV, so way more than 6 GeV. So top quarks are out of the question. The next is the bottom quark, which is about 4.5 GeV. So 2 times that is 9 GeV, which is more than 6. So bottom quarks can't be produced either because 2*4.5=9>6. So which quarks are lighter?\n\nThe charm quark is around 1.5 GeV. 2*1.5=3, which is less than 6. So that's possible. Similarly, strange quarks are about 100 MeV, up and down quarks are even lighter, maybe 2-5 MeV. Electrons are about 0.5 MeV, muons about 100 MeV, taus are around 1.77 GeV. So 2*tau is about 3.54 GeV, which is less than 6. \n\nSo which fermions can X decay into? Let's see:\n\n- Electron (e) and positron: mass negligible, so 2m_e <<6 GeV. Allowed.\n- Muon (\u03bc) and antimuon: same, 2m_mu around 0.2 GeV, which is way under 6. Allowed.\n- Tau (\u03c4) and antitau: 2*1.77= ~3.54 GeV.

But if the neutrino is left-handed and doesn't have a right-handed counterpart, it can't have mass, and thus, in the Standard Model, neutrinos are massless.

Since X is a boson, it can decay into a pair of fermions (like a quark and antiquark or a lepton and antilepton) if the energy is sufficient.\n\nThe mass of X is 6 GeV.
