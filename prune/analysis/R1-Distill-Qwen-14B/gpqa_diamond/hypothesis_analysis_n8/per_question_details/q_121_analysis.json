          "text1": "Wait, actually, when an organocuprate attacks an epoxide, it would proceed via an SN2 mechanism at one carbon, leading to inversion at that carbon. The other carbon would lose a proton from the solvent (like alcohol or water) to form the alcohol. \n\nSo, the steps would be: \n\n1. The organocuprate (Me2CuLi) attacks the less hindered carbon of the epoxide. \n2. This attack occurs with inversion of configuration at that carbon (since it's an SN2-like mechanism). \n3. The oxygen's other bond breaks, and the other carbon gets a proton from the solvent, forming an alcohol. \n\nTherefore, the product will have the new methyl group attached to the less hindered carbon (with inversion there), and the other carbon has an alcohol group. \n\nNow, the question is to determine which configuration (stereochemistry) is correct. \n\nThe starting compound is (1R,3R,4R,6S). Let me try to figure out which carbon of the epoxide is which in terms of numbering. \n\nAssuming the epoxide is at carbons 1 and 6 (since those are bridgeheads in the configuration), but that might not be correct.",
          "text2": "Wait, the organocuprate is a Grignard-like reagent (Me2CuLi), so when it attacks the epoxide, the mechanism is similar to opening the epoxide ring. \n\nThe general process for organocuprate opening of epoxides: the cuprate (nucleophile) attacks one carbon of the epoxide, leading to a new bond formation (with the organocuprate's alkyl group), and the other carbon becomes the leaving group (which gets a negative charge, then protonated to form an alcohol). \n\nSo, the product will have the methyl group added to one carbon of the epoxide, and the other carbon becomes an alcohol. \n\nThe stereochemistry at the carbon where the nucleophile attacks is inverted. \n\nSo, in the starting material, the epoxide has two carbons. Let's call them C1 and C2 (but this is arbitrary). The nucleophile attacks the less hindered one (say C1), leading to inversion. The other carbon (C2) will have the other group. \n\nThe key is figuring out which carbon is less hindered and the resulting stereochemistry. \n\nThe options have different configurations, so the stereochemistry at certain carbons will depend on inversion at the attacked carbon. \n\nGiven that the starting material has a specific configuration (1R,3R,4R,6S), after the reaction, the configuration at the attacked carbon will invert, and other configurations may be determined by the ring opening.",
