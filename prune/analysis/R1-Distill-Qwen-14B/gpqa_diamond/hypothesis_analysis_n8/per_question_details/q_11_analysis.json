SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2's frameshift signals have two conformations under tension, similar to others with comparable rates. I recall that pseudoknot structures in viral genomes (like in HIV or coronaviruses) facilitate -1 frameshifting. The structure's conformational flexibility might influence the efficiency. If a pseudoknot can adopt more conformations, perhaps it allows the ribosome to slip more effectively. The statement says a linear correlation between frameshifting rate and number of conformations.",

Or maybe the ExoN domain's role is to remove mismatched nucleotides, thus preventing errors. So the wording here might be tricky. Let me hold that thought and check other options.\n\nOption B: ORF3a triggers caspase-8 activation without affecting Bcl-2. Caspase-8 is part of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway (death receptors), while Bcl-2 is involved in the mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway. The statement says that since ORF3a activates caspase-8 but doesn't affect Bcl-2, the apoptosis is via extrinsic. That makes sense. Because if Bcl-2 wasn't affected, then the intrinsic pathway (which involves Bax/Bak and Bcl-2 family proteins) isn't being directly triggered. So this seems correct.\n\nOption C: The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations a pseudoknot can adopt. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both have PKs with two conformations under tension, similar to others with comparable rates. I think I've read that the structure of the pseudoknot (like the number of conformations it can form) influences the efficiency of frameshifting. If they have two conformations, maybe that gives an optimal shifting rate. A linear correlation here might be accurate. Not sure, but I'll need to think more.

The statement says that ORF3a doesn't affect Bcl-2 levels, so the apoptosis is via extrinsic. That makes sense because if caspase-8 is activated without Bcl-2 changes, it's the extrinsic pathway. So this seems correct. I remember some studies where viral proteins can induce apoptosis via one pathway, so B could be correct.\n\nOption C: The frameshifting rate is linear with the number of pseudoknot conformations. SARS and SARS-CoV-2 have two conformations and similar frameshifting rates. I think pseudoknot structures help in frameshifting. The more conformations (shapes) a pseudoknot can have under tension might allow better interaction with the ribosome, leading to higher frameshifting. So if they have two conformations and similar rates, this statement would be correct.",

I need to think more. \n\nMoving on to option B: ORF3a triggers caspase-8 activation without affecting Bcl-2. Since caspase-8 is part of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway (death receptors), and Bcl-2 is involved in the mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway. The statement says that since ORF3a activates caspase-8 but not affecting Bcl-2 levels, the mechanism is via the extrinsic pathway. That makes sense. Because if it's activating caspase-8 directly, which is extrinsic, then the pathway would be extrinsic. The fact that Bcl-2 isn't affected (since Bcl-2 usually inhibits apoptosis in the intrinsic pathway) would support that they're not using the intrinsic pathway here. So B seems correct.\n\nOption C: The frameshifting rate in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of pseudoknot conformations. Both SARS and SARS-CoV-2 have frameshift signals with two conformations under tension, similar to others with comparable rates. I recall that pseudoknot structures assist in frameshifting. The more conformations might mean more opportunities for the ribosome to slip, leading to higher frameshifting. But linear correlation? Or maybe it's that certain conformations are more effective.

Let me note that and check other options.\n\nOption B: ORF3a triggers caspase-8 activation, which is part of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway via death receptors, and Bcl-2 is involved in the mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway. The statement says that ORF3a doesn't affect Bcl-2 levels, so the apoptosis is via extrinsic. That makes sense because caspase-8 is part of extrinsic, which doesn't involve Bcl-2 directly. So this seems correct. If ORF3a activates caspase-8 without affecting Bcl-2, then the pathway is extrinsic. So B might be correct, so it's not the wrong answer.\n\nOption C: The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have frameshift signals with two conformations under tension, similar to other pseudoknots with comparable rates. Hmm. I recall that the efficiency of frameshifting can depend on the structure of the pseudoknot. More conformations might mean more flexibility, maybe affecting the rate. But the statement says linear correlation. Not sure if that's accurate. Also, if both viruses have two conformations, then their frameshifting rates would be similar. The option says \"similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates\". So if the number of conformations is linked to the rate, then maybe that's correct. But I'm not sure if the linear correlation is accurate.",
          "text2": "Wait, if the exonuclease is part of the replication machinery, maybe it's involved in degrading the RNA strand as part of replication, not preventing breakdown. Or maybe the ExoN domain's role is to remove mismatched nucleotides, thus preventing errors. So the wording here might be tricky. Let me hold that thought and check other options.\n\nOption B: ORF3a triggers caspase-8 activation without affecting Bcl-2. Caspase-8 is part of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway (death receptors), while Bcl-2 is involved in the mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway. The statement says that since ORF3a activates caspase-8 but doesn't affect Bcl-2, the apoptosis is via extrinsic. That makes sense. Because if Bcl-2 wasn't affected, then the intrinsic pathway (which involves Bax/Bak and Bcl-2 family proteins) isn't being directly triggered. So this seems correct.\n\nOption C: The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations a pseudoknot can adopt. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both have PKs with two conformations under tension, similar to others with comparable rates. I think I've read that the structure of the pseudoknot (like the number of conformations it can form) influences the efficiency of frameshifting. If they have two conformations, maybe that gives an optimal shifting rate. A linear correlation here might be accurate. Not sure, but I'll need to think more. Also, both SARS and SARS-CoV-2 having similar structures here would make sense as they are related viruses.\n\nOption D: Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near the 5' end via -1 frameshift using slippery sites and pseudoknots. The SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting has the same conformation as SARS-CoV.",
