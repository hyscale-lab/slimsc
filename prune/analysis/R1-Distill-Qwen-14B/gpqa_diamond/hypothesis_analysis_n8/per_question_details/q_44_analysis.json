          "text1": "Wait, that's a mouthful. I think this is a dye that's used to measure mitochondrial membrane potential. Because the dye, often called JC-10 or similar (wait, I think another name is TMRM or something else), when the mitochondrial membrane is polarized, the dye accumulates in the mitochondria and emits a certain fluorescence. If the membrane potential is lost, like in damaged mitochondria, the dye doesn't accumulate, and maybe there's a shift in emission. Flow cytometry can measure the fluorescence to assess mitochondrial health. So this experiment would indicate if the drug affects mitochondrial membrane potential or health. So this is a relevant experiment for the mitochondrial role. So option C is not the answer.\n\nOption D: Confocal microscopy after Mito-RTP staining. Mito-RTP rings a bell. I think Mito-RTP is a dye that specifically targets the mitochondria. It might be a probe that fluoresces when inside the mitochondria. Confocal microscopy can then image the mitochondria's structure or number. So if the drug affects the mitochondria, you could see changes in their structure, number, or distribution. So this experiment would help assess mitochondrial changes, so it's relevant. So option D is not the answer.\n\nBack to option A: So they extract mitochondria via differential centrifugation. Then use a glucose uptake assay. If the assay is for glucose uptake by the mitochondria, but I thought that's not a thing.",

It intercalates into the mitochondria and aggregates there, showing a red fluorescence when the membrane potential is high. If mitochondria are damaged, the dye doesn't accumulate, and the fluorescence changes. So using flow cytometry with this dye would indicate the health of the mitochondria. So if the drug affects mitochondrial membrane potential, this assay would show it. So option C would help, so it's not the correct answer.\n\nOption D: Confocal microscopy after Mito-RTP staining. Mito-RTP is a mitochondrial tracker. It's a dye that specifically targets mitochondria, maybe by accumulating in the matrix, and emits fluorescence under certain wavelengths. So if you use confocal, you can visualize the mitochondria's structure. If the drug affects the mitochondria, you might see changes in their shape, number, or distribution.

When the mitochondria are healthy, JC-1 aggregates and emits red fluorescence. If the membrane potential is lost (like in damaged mitochondria), it remains in monomer form and emits green. So this assay would show if the drug affects mitochondrial function by disrupting the membrane potential. So this option would help, so it's not the correct answer.\n\nOption D: Confocal microscopy after Mito-RTP staining. Mito-RTP\u2014I think that refers to a mitochondrial tracker, maybe MitoTracker Red or similar. These dyes are taken up by active mitochondria and accumulate based on membrane potential. If mitochondria are dysfunctional, they can't take in the dye, or it's cleared. So using this, you can visualize the mitochondria under the microscope. If the drug affects mitochondrial function, the MitoTracker signal would change. So this method would help in assessing the drug's effect on mitochondria. So option D is helpful and not the correct answer.\n\nSo the question is asking which experiment will NOT help discover the mitochondrial role of the drug.

          "text1": "Wait, but wait a minute. Maybe the Glucose Uptake Assay is done on the cells, not on the isolated mitochondria. Because if you extract mitochondria and then test them for glucose uptake, you'd find very little because mitochondria don't uptake glucose. But if the assay is performed on the cells before extraction, then it would measure the overall glucose uptake, which is mainly via the cell membrane. But that's glycolysis, not mitochondrial.
