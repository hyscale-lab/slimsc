The image charge q' is - (R q)/d. The distance between q and q' is the distance between the original charge at d from the center and the image charge at R\u00b2/d from the center. So the separation is d - (R\u00b2/d)?",

But I should check the options to see if any formulas make sense.\n\nThe potential energy here would involve the interaction between the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, any induced charge would be such that the sphere remains at zero potential. Hmm, maybe I need to use the method of images here?\n\nOh right, the method of images is used for grounded conductors. Let me recall: when you have a point charge near a grounded conducting sphere, you can model it with an image charge inside the sphere. The image charge q' would be located along the line from the center to the charge q. The position and magnitude of the image charge depend on R and the distance d.\n\nThe formula for the image charge in such a case is q' = - (R/d) * q. The location of the image charge would be at a distance of R\u00b2/d from the center, towards the charge q. Because the image charge is placed such that the sphere remains an equipotential (grounded, so zero potential). \n\nSo, the potential energy of the system would then be the potential energy between the two charges: the original charge q and the image charge q'. Since they are point charges, the potential energy U is k * (q * q') / r, where r is the distance between them. \n\nLet me calculate r first. The original charge is at distance d from the center, the image charge is at R\u00b2/d from the center, on the same line. So the distance between them is d - (R\u00b2/d) = (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d. So the separation r = (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d. \n\nSo substituting the values: q' is - (R q)/d. So the product q * q' is q * (-R q/d) = - R q\u00b2 /d. \n\nThen U = k * ( - R q\u00b2 /d ) / ( (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d ). \n\nThe d in the denominator cancels with the d in the numerator from the denominator. Let me compute that step again. Let me write it out:\n\nU = k * [ (q * q') ] / r = k * [ - R q\u00b2 / d ] / [ (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d ]\n\nThe denominators: the denominator of the main fraction is (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d. So dividing by that is multiplying by d/(d\u00b2 - R\u00b2). \n\nSo the numerator terms: -R q\u00b2 / d multiplied by d/(d\u00b2 - R\u00b2) gives:\n\n- R q\u00b2 / (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2) multiplied by (d cancels). \n\nSo overall, U = k * [ - R q\u00b2 / (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2) ]",

So the separation r = (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d. \n\nSo substituting the values: q' is - (R q)/d. So the product q * q' is q * (-R q/d) = - R q\u00b2 /d. \n\nThen U = k * ( - R q\u00b2 /d ) / ( (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d ). \n\nThe d in the denominator cancels with the d in the numerator from the denominator.

Since the sphere is grounded, any induced charge would be such that the sphere remains at zero potential. Hmm, maybe I need to use the method of images here?\n\nOh right, the method of images is used for grounded conductors. Let me recall: when you have a point charge near a grounded conducting sphere, you can model it with an image charge inside the sphere. The image charge q' would be located along the line from the center to the charge q. The position and magnitude of the image charge depend on R and the distance d.\n\nThe formula for the image charge in such a case is q' = - (R/d) * q. The location of the image charge would be at a distance of R\u00b2/d from the center, towards the charge q. Because the image charge is placed such that the sphere remains an equipotential (grounded, so zero potential). \n\nSo, the potential energy of the system would then be the potential energy between the two charges: the original charge q and the image charge q'. Since they are point charges, the potential energy U is k * (q * q') / r, where r is the distance between them. \n\nLet me calculate r first. The original charge is at distance d from the center, the image charge is at R\u00b2/d from the center, on the same line. So the distance between them is d - (R\u00b2/d) = (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d. So the separation r = (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d. \n\nSo substituting the values: q' is - (R q)/d. So the product q * q' is q * (-R q/d) = - R q\u00b2 /d. \n\nThen U = k * ( - R q\u00b2 /d ) / ( (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d ). \n\nThe d in the denominator cancels with the d in the numerator from the denominator. Let me compute that step again. Let me write it out:\n\nU = k * [ (q * q') ] / r = k * [ - R q\u00b2 / d ] / [ (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d ]\n\nThe denominators: the denominator of the main fraction is (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d. So dividing by that is multiplying by d/(d\u00b2 - R\u00b2). \n\nSo the numerator terms: -R q\u00b2 / d multiplied by d/(d\u00b2 - R\u00b2) gives:\n\n- R q\u00b2 / (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2) multiplied by (d cancels). \n\nSo overall, U = k * [ - R q\u00b2 / (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2) ]",

The original charge is at distance d from the center, the image charge is at R\u00b2/d from the center, on the same line. So the distance between them is d - (R\u00b2/d) = (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d. So the separation r = (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d. \n\nSo substituting the values: q' is - (R q)/d. So the product q * q' is q * (-R q/d) = - R q\u00b2 /d. \n\nThen U = k * ( - R q\u00b2 /d ) / ( (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d ). \n\nThe d in the denominator cancels with the d in the numerator from the denominator. Let me compute that step again. Let me write it out:\n\nU = k * [ (q * q') ] / r = k * [ - R q\u00b2 / d ] / [ (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d ]\n\nThe denominators: the denominator of the main fraction is (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d. So dividing by that is multiplying by d/(d\u00b2 - R\u00b2). \n\nSo the numerator terms: -R q\u00b2 / d multiplied by d/(d\u00b2 - R\u00b2) gives:\n\n- R q\u00b2 / (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2) multiplied by (d cancels). \n\nSo overall, U = k * [ - R q\u00b2 / (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2) ]",

Since the sphere is grounded, any induced charge would be such that the sphere remains at zero potential. Hmm, maybe I need to use the method of images here?\n\nOh right, the method of images is used for grounded conductors. Let me recall: when you have a point charge near a grounded conducting sphere, you can model it with an image charge inside the sphere. The image charge q' would be located along the line from the center to the charge q. The position and magnitude of the image charge depend on R and the distance d.\n\nThe formula for the image charge in such a case is q' = - (R/d) * q. The location of the image charge would be at a distance of R\u00b2/d from the center, towards the charge q. Because the image charge is placed such that the sphere remains an equipotential (grounded, so zero potential). \n\nSo, the potential energy of the system would then be the potential energy between the two charges: the original charge q and the image charge q'. Since they are point charges, the potential energy U is k * (q * q') / r, where r is the distance between them. \n\nLet me calculate r first. The original charge is at distance d from the center, the image charge is at R\u00b2/d from the center, on the same line. So the distance between them is d - (R\u00b2/d) = (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d. So the separation r = (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d. \n\nSo substituting the values: q' is - (R q)/d. So the product q * q' is q * (-R q/d) = - R q\u00b2 /d. \n\nThen U = k * ( - R q\u00b2 /d ) / ( (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d ). \n\nThe d in the denominator cancels with the d in the numerator from the denominator. Let me compute that step again. Let me write it out:\n\nU = k * [ (q * q') ] / r = k * [ - R q\u00b2 / d ] / [ (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d ]\n\nThe denominators: the denominator of the main fraction is (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d.

Since the sphere is grounded, any induced charge would be such that the sphere remains at zero potential. Hmm, maybe I need to use the method of images here?\n\nOh right, the method of images is used for grounded conductors. Let me recall: when you have a point charge near a grounded conducting sphere, you can model it with an image charge inside the sphere. The image charge q' would be located along the line from the center to the charge q. The position and magnitude of the image charge depend on R and the distance d.\n\nThe formula for the image charge in such a case is q' = - (R/d) * q. The location of the image charge would be at a distance of R\u00b2/d from the center, towards the charge q. Because the image charge is placed such that the sphere remains an equipotential (grounded, so zero potential). \n\nSo, the potential energy of the system would then be the potential energy between the two charges: the original charge q and the image charge q'. Since they are point charges, the potential energy U is k * (q * q') / r, where r is the distance between them. \n\nLet me calculate r first. The original charge is at distance d from the center, the image charge is at R\u00b2/d from the center, on the same line. So the distance between them is d - (R\u00b2/d) = (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d. So the separation r = (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d. \n\nSo substituting the values: q' is - (R q)/d. So the product q * q' is q * (-R q/d) = - R q\u00b2 /d. \n\nThen U = k * ( - R q\u00b2 /d ) / ( (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d ). \n\nThe d in the denominator cancels with the d in the numerator from the denominator. Let me compute that step again. Let me write it out:\n\nU = k * [ (q * q') ] / r = k * [ - R q\u00b2 / d ] / [ (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d ]\n\nThe denominators: the denominator of the main fraction is (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d. So dividing by that is multiplying by d/(d\u00b2 - R\u00b2). \n\nSo the numerator terms: -R q\u00b2 / d multiplied by d/(d\u00b2 - R\u00b2) gives:\n\n- R q\u00b2 / (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2) multiplied by (d cancels). \n\nSo overall, U = k * [ - R q\u00b2 / (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2) ]",

Since they are point charges, the potential energy U is k * (q * q') / r, where r is the distance between them. \n\nLet me calculate r first. The original charge is at distance d from the center, the image charge is at R\u00b2/d from the center, on the same line. So the distance between them is d - (R\u00b2/d) = (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d. So the separation r = (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d. \n\nSo substituting the values: q' is - (R q)/d. So the product q * q' is q * (-R q/d) = - R q\u00b2 /d. \n\nThen U = k * ( - R q\u00b2 /d ) / ( (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d ). \n\nThe d in the denominator cancels with the d in the numerator from the denominator. Let me compute that step again. Let me write it out:\n\nU = k * [ (q * q') ] / r = k * [ - R q\u00b2 / d ] / [ (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d ]\n\nThe denominators: the denominator of the main fraction is (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d.

Since the sphere is grounded, any induced charge would be such that the sphere remains at zero potential. Hmm, maybe I need to use the method of images here?\n\nOh right, the method of images is used for grounded conductors. Let me recall: when you have a point charge near a grounded conducting sphere, you can model it with an image charge inside the sphere. The image charge q' would be located along the line from the center to the charge q. The position and magnitude of the image charge depend on R and the distance d.\n\nThe formula for the image charge in such a case is q' = - (R/d) * q. The location of the image charge would be at a distance of R\u00b2/d from the center, towards the charge q. Because the image charge is placed such that the sphere remains an equipotential (grounded, so zero potential). \n\nSo, the potential energy of the system would then be the potential energy between the two charges: the original charge q and the image charge q'. Since they are point charges, the potential energy U is k * (q * q') / r, where r is the distance between them. \n\nLet me calculate r first. The original charge is at distance d from the center, the image charge is at R\u00b2/d from the center, on the same line. So the distance between them is d - (R\u00b2/d) = (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d. So the separation r = (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d. \n\nSo substituting the values: q' is - (R q)/d. So the product q * q' is q * (-R q/d) = - R q\u00b2 /d. \n\nThen U = k * ( - R q\u00b2 /d ) / ( (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d ). \n\nThe d in the denominator cancels with the d in the numerator from the denominator. Let me compute that step again. Let me write it out:\n\nU = k * [ (q * q') ] / r = k * [ - R q\u00b2 / d ] / [ (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d ]\n\nThe denominators: the denominator of the main fraction is (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d. So dividing by that is multiplying by d/(d\u00b2 - R\u00b2). \n\nSo the numerator terms: -R q\u00b2 / d multiplied by d/(d\u00b2 - R\u00b2) gives:\n\n- R q\u00b2 / (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2) multiplied by (d cancels). \n\nSo overall, U = k * [ - R q\u00b2 / (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2) ]",

So the separation r = (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d. \n\nSo substituting the values: q' is - (R q)/d. So the product q * q' is q * (-R q/d) = - R q\u00b2 /d. \n\nThen U = k * ( - R q\u00b2 /d ) / ( (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d ). \n\nThe d in the denominator cancels with the d in the numerator from the denominator.

That way, the sphere's surface (radius R) would be the surface where the potential from both charges cancels out. \n\nSo the potential energy of the system would be the interaction between the original charge and the image charge. Since the sphere is grounded, maybe its contribution to the potential energy is considered to be part of the system's ground, so we just consider the potential energy between q and q'?",
