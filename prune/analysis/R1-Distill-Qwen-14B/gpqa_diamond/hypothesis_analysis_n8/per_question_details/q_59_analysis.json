But the OH- is from the Ba(OH)2, which is 0.18 moles.\n\nSo first, the OH- will neutralize the H+ from HCl. Let's see: \n\nHCl provides 0.08 moles of H+. The OH- is 0.18 moles. The neutralization reaction between H+ and OH- is H+ + OH- \u2192 H2O. So, the H+ from HCl will neutralize 0.08 moles of OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- remaining. \n\nThen, the remaining OH- (0.10 moles) will react with the acetic acid. The acetic acid can donate H+ to react with OH-. The reaction would be: \n\nOH- + CH3COOH \u2192 CH3COO- + H2O \n\nSo each mole of OH- can deprotonate a mole of CH3COOH, producing CH3COO-.\n\nWe have 0.10 moles of excess OH- after neutralizing HCl. The acetic acid has 0.05 moles. So, the OH- will react with the acetic acid. Since there's 0.10 moles OH- and only 0.05 moles of acetic acid, the acetic acid will be completely deprotonated (since 0.05 < 0.10). So all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will be converted to CH3COO-, and the OH- remaining would be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.\n\nTherefore, after all reactions, the total remaining OH- is 0.05 moles.",

But the OH- is from the Ba(OH)2, which is 0.18 moles.\n\nSo first, the OH- will neutralize the H+ from HCl. Let's see: \n\nHCl provides 0.08 moles of H+. The OH- is 0.18 moles. The neutralization reaction between H+ and OH- is H+ + OH- \u2192 H2O. So, the H+ from HCl will neutralize 0.08 moles of OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- remaining. \n\nThen, the remaining OH- (0.10 moles) will react with the acetic acid. The acetic acid can donate H+ to react with OH-. The reaction would be: \n\nOH- + CH3COOH \u2192 CH3COO- + H2O \n\nSo each mole of OH- can deprotonate a mole of CH3COOH, producing CH3COO-.\n\nWe have 0.10 moles of excess OH- after neutralizing HCl. The acetic acid has 0.05 moles. So, the OH- will react with the acetic acid. Since there's 0.10 moles OH- and only 0.05 moles of acetic acid, the acetic acid will be completely deprotonated (since 0.05 < 0.10). So all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will be converted to CH3COO-, and the OH- remaining would be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.\n\nTherefore, after all reactions, the total remaining OH- is 0.05 moles.",

Since there's 0.10 moles OH- and only 0.05 moles of acetic acid, the acetic acid will be completely deprotonated (since 0.05 < 0.10).
