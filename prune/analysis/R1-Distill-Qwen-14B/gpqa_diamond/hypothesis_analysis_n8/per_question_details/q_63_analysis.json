But when a photon is absorbed, does it correspond to a transition in rotation, vibration, or both? The problem says \"switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy\". The next state would be the first excited state. \n\nAh, but in the rotation-vibration model, the total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational energy. The ground state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0).

          "text1": "Wait, in the fundamental state, the molecule is in the lowest energy state, which is v=0 and J=0. The next lowest energy state could be either v=1 (first vibrational excited state) or J=1 (first rotational excited state). The energy of the vibrational state is higher. Let me calculate the energy differences for both possibilities and see which is lower. The photon's energy would be the difference between the two states.\n\nFirst, the vibrational energy difference. For a harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are (v + 1/2) h\u03c9. The ground state is v=0, so the first excited state is v=1. The energy difference is h\u03c9. \n\nThe rotational energy levels are given by Erot = B J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The ground state is J=0, so the first excited state is J=1. The energy difference is B(1*2) - B(0) = 2B. \n\nSo, which is smaller? To compare, we need to compute both. Let's see the given data. Let's compute B first. \n\nThe rotational constant B is (h/(8\u03c0\u00b2I)), where I is the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia I = \u03bc R\u00b2, where \u03bc is the reduced mass. \n\nGiven the masses of X and Y as 20 amu and 2 amu, so \u03bc = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 \u2248 1.818 amu. Convert that to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So \u03bc \u2248 1.818 * 1.66e-27 \u2248 let me calculate that. 1.818 * 1.66 \u2248 3.02, so 3.02e-27 kg. \n\nThe bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. \n\nSo I = \u03bc R\u00b2 = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2. Let's compute that: (2e-10)^2 =4e-20, so I = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg\u00b7m\u00b2. \n\nThen B = h/(8\u03c0\u00b2 I). h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s. Let's plug in the numbers:\n\nB = 6.626e-34 / (8 * \u03c0\u00b2 * 1.208e-46). \n\nFirst compute denominator: 8 * \u03c0\u00b2 \u2248 8 * 9.8696 \u2248 78.9568; then multiply by 1.208e-46: 78.9568 * 1.208e-46 \u2248 95.33e-46. \n\nSo B \u2248 6.626e-34 / 95.33e-46 = (6.626 / 95.33) * 1e12 \u2248 0.0695 *1e12 \u2248 6.95e10?",
          "text2": "Wait, but maybe in this specific case?\n\nHmm, I need to figure out which is lower. Let's see. The energy of the vibrational transition is \u0394E_vib = \u0127\u03c9. The rotational energy levels are given by Erot = B J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The transition from J=0 to J=1 would have \u0394E_rot = B(1*2 - 0*1) = 2B. So I need to compare \u0127\u03c9 and 2B.\n\nIf the vibrational energy is higher than the rotational, then the lowest energy transition would be rotational. But if the rotational transition requires less energy, then the photon would have to have that energy. But the problem states that the molecule is in the fundamental state. Let me check the given parameters to see which is smaller.\n\nThe problem gives the bond length R = 2 angstroms (so 2e-10 meters), masses of X and Y are 20 and 2 amu. Let me compute B first. The rotational constant B is (\u0127/(2\u03bcR\u00b2)), where \u03bc is the reduced mass. Let me compute \u03bc.\n\nThe reduced mass \u03bc = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So \u03bc = (20*2)/(22) = 40/22 \u2248 1.818 amu. Convert that to kg: 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So \u03bc \u2248 1.818 * 1.66e-27 \u2248 let's calculate that. 1.818 * 1.66 is roughly 1.818*1.6=2.9088, plus 1.818*0.06=0.109, so total \u2248 3.0178e-27 kg.\n\nThen B = \u0127/(2\u03bc R\u00b2). Let me compute R squared first. R is 2e-10 m, so R\u00b2 is 4e-20 m\u00b2. Plugging in numbers:\n\n\u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nSo B = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 3.0178e-27 kg * 4e-20 m\u00b2 )\n\nLet me compute denominator first: 2 * 3.0178e-27 = 6.0356e-27. Multiply that by 4e-20: 6.0356e-27 *4e-20 = 2.414e-46 kg m\u00b2.\n\nSo B = 1.05457e-34 / 2.414e-46 \u2248 (1.05457 / 2.414) * 1e12 \u2248 approx 0.437 * 1e12 = 4.37e11?",

The next lowest energy state could be either v=1 (first vibrational excited state) or J=1 (first rotational excited state). The energy of the vibrational state is higher. Let me calculate the energy differences for both possibilities and see which is lower. The photon's energy would be the difference between the two states.\n\nFirst, the vibrational energy difference. For a harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are (v + 1/2) h\u03c9. The ground state is v=0, so the first excited state is v=1. The energy difference is h\u03c9. \n\nThe rotational energy levels are given by Erot = B J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The ground state is J=0, so the first excited state is J=1. The energy difference is B(1*2) - B(0) = 2B. \n\nSo, which is smaller? To compare, we need to compute both. Let's see the given data. Let's compute B first. \n\nThe rotational constant B is (h/(8\u03c0\u00b2I)), where I is the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia I = \u03bc R\u00b2, where \u03bc is the reduced mass. \n\nGiven the masses of X and Y as 20 amu and 2 amu, so \u03bc = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 \u2248 1.818 amu. Convert that to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So \u03bc \u2248 1.818 * 1.66e-27 \u2248 let me calculate that. 1.818 * 1.66 \u2248 3.02, so 3.02e-27 kg. \n\nThe bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. \n\nSo I = \u03bc R\u00b2 = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2. Let's compute that: (2e-10)^2 =4e-20, so I = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg\u00b7m\u00b2. \n\nThen B = h/(8\u03c0\u00b2 I). h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s. Let's plug in the numbers:\n\nB = 6.626e-34 / (8 * \u03c0\u00b2 * 1.208e-46). \n\nFirst compute denominator: 8 * \u03c0\u00b2 \u2248 8 * 9.8696 \u2248 78.9568; then multiply by 1.208e-46: 78.9568 * 1.208e-46 \u2248 95.33e-46. \n\nSo B \u2248 6.626e-34 / 95.33e-46 = (6.626 / 95.33) * 1e12 \u2248 0.0695 *1e12 \u2248 6.95e10?",
          "text2": "Wait, but maybe in this specific case?\n\nHmm, I need to figure out which is lower. Let's see. The energy of the vibrational transition is \u0394E_vib = \u0127\u03c9. The rotational energy levels are given by Erot = B J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The transition from J=0 to J=1 would have \u0394E_rot = B(1*2 - 0*1) = 2B. So I need to compare \u0127\u03c9 and 2B.\n\nIf the vibrational energy is higher than the rotational, then the lowest energy transition would be rotational. But if the rotational transition requires less energy, then the photon would have to have that energy. But the problem states that the molecule is in the fundamental state. Let me check the given parameters to see which is smaller.\n\nThe problem gives the bond length R = 2 angstroms (so 2e-10 meters), masses of X and Y are 20 and 2 amu. Let me compute B first. The rotational constant B is (\u0127/(2\u03bcR\u00b2)), where \u03bc is the reduced mass. Let me compute \u03bc.\n\nThe reduced mass \u03bc = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So \u03bc = (20*2)/(22) = 40/22 \u2248 1.818 amu. Convert that to kg: 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So \u03bc \u2248 1.818 * 1.66e-27 \u2248 let's calculate that. 1.818 * 1.66 is roughly 1.818*1.6=2.9088, plus 1.818*0.06=0.109, so total \u2248 3.0178e-27 kg.\n\nThen B = \u0127/(2\u03bc R\u00b2). Let me compute R squared first. R is 2e-10 m, so R\u00b2 is 4e-20 m\u00b2. Plugging in numbers:\n\n\u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nSo B = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 3.0178e-27 kg * 4e-20 m\u00b2 )\n\nLet me compute denominator first: 2 * 3.0178e-27 = 6.0356e-27. Multiply that by 4e-20: 6.0356e-27 *4e-20 = 2.414e-46 kg m\u00b2.\n\nSo B = 1.05457e-34 / 2.414e-46 \u2248 (1.05457 / 2.414) * 1e12 \u2248 approx 0.437 * 1e12 = 4.37e11?",

The next lowest energy state could be either v=1 (first vibrational excited state) or J=1 (first rotational excited state). The energy of the vibrational state is higher. Let me calculate the energy differences for both possibilities and see which is lower. The photon's energy would be the difference between the two states.\n\nFirst, the vibrational energy difference. For a harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are (v + 1/2) h\u03c9. The ground state is v=0, so the first excited state is v=1. The energy difference is h\u03c9. \n\nThe rotational energy levels are given by Erot = B J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The ground state is J=0, so the first excited state is J=1. The energy difference is B(1*2) - B(0) = 2B. \n\nSo, which is smaller? To compare, we need to compute both. Let's see the given data. Let's compute B first. \n\nThe rotational constant B is (h/(8\u03c0\u00b2I)), where I is the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia I = \u03bc R\u00b2, where \u03bc is the reduced mass. \n\nGiven the masses of X and Y as 20 amu and 2 amu, so \u03bc = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 \u2248 1.818 amu. Convert that to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So \u03bc \u2248 1.818 * 1.66e-27 \u2248 let me calculate that. 1.818 * 1.66 \u2248 3.02, so 3.02e-27 kg. \n\nThe bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. \n\nSo I = \u03bc R\u00b2 = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2. Let's compute that: (2e-10)^2 =4e-20, so I = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg\u00b7m\u00b2. \n\nThen B = h/(8\u03c0\u00b2 I). h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s. Let's plug in the numbers:\n\nB = 6.626e-34 / (8 * \u03c0\u00b2 * 1.208e-46). \n\nFirst compute denominator: 8 * \u03c0\u00b2 \u2248 8 * 9.8696 \u2248 78.9568; then multiply by 1.208e-46: 78.9568 * 1.208e-46 \u2248 95.33e-46. \n\nSo B \u2248 6.626e-34 / 95.33e-46 = (6.626 / 95.33) * 1e12 \u2248 0.0695 *1e12 \u2248 6.95e10?",

The rotational energy levels are given by Erot = B J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The transition from J=0 to J=1 would have \u0394E_rot = B(1*2 - 0*1) = 2B. So I need to compare \u0127\u03c9 and 2B.\n\nIf the vibrational energy is higher than the rotational, then the lowest energy transition would be rotational. But if the rotational transition requires less energy, then the photon would have to have that energy. But the problem states that the molecule is in the fundamental state. Let me check the given parameters to see which is smaller.\n\nThe problem gives the bond length R = 2 angstroms (so 2e-10 meters), masses of X and Y are 20 and 2 amu. Let me compute B first. The rotational constant B is (\u0127/(2\u03bcR\u00b2)), where \u03bc is the reduced mass. Let me compute \u03bc.\n\nThe reduced mass \u03bc = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So \u03bc = (20*2)/(22) = 40/22 \u2248 1.818 amu. Convert that to kg: 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So \u03bc \u2248 1.818 * 1.66e-27 \u2248 let's calculate that. 1.818 * 1.66 is roughly 1.818*1.6=2.9088, plus 1.818*0.06=0.109, so total \u2248 3.0178e-27 kg.\n\nThen B = \u0127/(2\u03bc R\u00b2). Let me compute R squared first. R is 2e-10 m, so R\u00b2 is 4e-20 m\u00b2. Plugging in numbers:\n\n\u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nSo B = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 3.0178e-27 kg * 4e-20 m\u00b2 )\n\nLet me compute denominator first: 2 * 3.0178e-27 = 6.0356e-27. Multiply that by 4e-20: 6.0356e-27 *4e-20 = 2.414e-46 kg m\u00b2.\n\nSo B = 1.05457e-34 / 2.414e-46 \u2248 (1.05457 / 2.414) * 1e12 \u2248 approx 0.437 * 1e12 = 4.37e11?",

The next lowest energy state could be either v=1 (first vibrational excited state) or J=1 (first rotational excited state). The energy of the vibrational state is higher. Let me calculate the energy differences for both possibilities and see which is lower. The photon's energy would be the difference between the two states.\n\nFirst, the vibrational energy difference. For a harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are (v + 1/2) h\u03c9. The ground state is v=0, so the first excited state is v=1. The energy difference is h\u03c9. \n\nThe rotational energy levels are given by Erot = B J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The ground state is J=0, so the first excited state is J=1. The energy difference is B(1*2) - B(0) = 2B. \n\nSo, which is smaller? To compare, we need to compute both. Let's see the given data. Let's compute B first. \n\nThe rotational constant B is (h/(8\u03c0\u00b2I)), where I is the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia I = \u03bc R\u00b2, where \u03bc is the reduced mass. \n\nGiven the masses of X and Y as 20 amu and 2 amu, so \u03bc = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 \u2248 1.818 amu. Convert that to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So \u03bc \u2248 1.818 * 1.66e-27 \u2248 let me calculate that. 1.818 * 1.66 \u2248 3.02, so 3.02e-27 kg. \n\nThe bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. \n\nSo I = \u03bc R\u00b2 = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2. Let's compute that: (2e-10)^2 =4e-20, so I = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg\u00b7m\u00b2. \n\nThen B = h/(8\u03c0\u00b2 I). h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s. Let's plug in the numbers:\n\nB = 6.626e-34 / (8 * \u03c0\u00b2 * 1.208e-46). \n\nFirst compute denominator: 8 * \u03c0\u00b2 \u2248 8 * 9.8696 \u2248 78.9568; then multiply by 1.208e-46: 78.9568 * 1.208e-46 \u2248 95.33e-46. \n\nSo B \u2248 6.626e-34 / 95.33e-46 = (6.626 / 95.33) * 1e12 \u2248 0.0695 *1e12 \u2248 6.95e10?",

The rotational energy levels are given by Erot = B J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The transition from J=0 to J=1 would have \u0394E_rot = B(1*2 - 0*1) = 2B. So I need to compare \u0127\u03c9 and 2B.\n\nIf the vibrational energy is higher than the rotational, then the lowest energy transition would be rotational. But if the rotational transition requires less energy, then the photon would have to have that energy. But the problem states that the molecule is in the fundamental state. Let me check the given parameters to see which is smaller.\n\nThe problem gives the bond length R = 2 angstroms (so 2e-10 meters), masses of X and Y are 20 and 2 amu. Let me compute B first. The rotational constant B is (\u0127/(2\u03bcR\u00b2)), where \u03bc is the reduced mass. Let me compute \u03bc.\n\nThe reduced mass \u03bc = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So \u03bc = (20*2)/(22) = 40/22 \u2248 1.818 amu. Convert that to kg: 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So \u03bc \u2248 1.818 * 1.66e-27 \u2248 let's calculate that. 1.818 * 1.66 is roughly 1.818*1.6=2.9088, plus 1.818*0.06=0.109, so total \u2248 3.0178e-27 kg.\n\nThen B = \u0127/(2\u03bc R\u00b2). Let me compute R squared first. R is 2e-10 m, so R\u00b2 is 4e-20 m\u00b2. Plugging in numbers:\n\n\u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nSo B = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 3.0178e-27 kg * 4e-20 m\u00b2 )\n\nLet me compute denominator first: 2 * 3.0178e-27 = 6.0356e-27. Multiply that by 4e-20: 6.0356e-27 *4e-20 = 2.414e-46 kg m\u00b2.\n\nSo B = 1.05457e-34 / 2.414e-46 \u2248 (1.05457 / 2.414) * 1e12 \u2248 approx 0.437 * 1e12 = 4.37e11?",

The next lowest energy state could be either v=1 (first vibrational excited state) or J=1 (first rotational excited state). The energy of the vibrational state is higher. Let me calculate the energy differences for both possibilities and see which is lower. The photon's energy would be the difference between the two states.\n\nFirst, the vibrational energy difference. For a harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are (v + 1/2) h\u03c9. The ground state is v=0, so the first excited state is v=1. The energy difference is h\u03c9. \n\nThe rotational energy levels are given by Erot = B J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The ground state is J=0, so the first excited state is J=1. The energy difference is B(1*2) - B(0) = 2B. \n\nSo, which is smaller? To compare, we need to compute both. Let's see the given data. Let's compute B first. \n\nThe rotational constant B is (h/(8\u03c0\u00b2I)), where I is the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia I = \u03bc R\u00b2, where \u03bc is the reduced mass. \n\nGiven the masses of X and Y as 20 amu and 2 amu, so \u03bc = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 \u2248 1.818 amu. Convert that to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So \u03bc \u2248 1.818 * 1.66e-27 \u2248 let me calculate that. 1.818 * 1.66 \u2248 3.02, so 3.02e-27 kg. \n\nThe bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. \n\nSo I = \u03bc R\u00b2 = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2. Let's compute that: (2e-10)^2 =4e-20, so I = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg\u00b7m\u00b2. \n\nThen B = h/(8\u03c0\u00b2 I). h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s. Let's plug in the numbers:\n\nB = 6.626e-34 / (8 * \u03c0\u00b2 * 1.208e-46). \n\nFirst compute denominator: 8 * \u03c0\u00b2 \u2248 8 * 9.8696 \u2248 78.9568; then multiply by 1.208e-46: 78.9568 * 1.208e-46 \u2248 95.33e-46. \n\nSo B \u2248 6.626e-34 / 95.33e-46 = (6.626 / 95.33) * 1e12 \u2248 0.0695 *1e12 \u2248 6.95e10?",

The rotational energy levels are given by Erot = B J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The transition from J=0 to J=1 would have \u0394E_rot = B(1*2 - 0*1) = 2B. So I need to compare \u0127\u03c9 and 2B.\n\nIf the vibrational energy is higher than the rotational, then the lowest energy transition would be rotational. But if the rotational transition requires less energy, then the photon would have to have that energy. But the problem states that the molecule is in the fundamental state. Let me check the given parameters to see which is smaller.\n\nThe problem gives the bond length R = 2 angstroms (so 2e-10 meters), masses of X and Y are 20 and 2 amu. Let me compute B first. The rotational constant B is (\u0127/(2\u03bcR\u00b2)), where \u03bc is the reduced mass. Let me compute \u03bc.\n\nThe reduced mass \u03bc = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So \u03bc = (20*2)/(22) = 40/22 \u2248 1.818 amu. Convert that to kg: 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So \u03bc \u2248 1.818 * 1.66e-27 \u2248 let's calculate that. 1.818 * 1.66 is roughly 1.818*1.6=2.9088, plus 1.818*0.06=0.109, so total \u2248 3.0178e-27 kg.\n\nThen B = \u0127/(2\u03bc R\u00b2). Let me compute R squared first. R is 2e-10 m, so R\u00b2 is 4e-20 m\u00b2. Plugging in numbers:\n\n\u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nSo B = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 3.0178e-27 kg * 4e-20 m\u00b2 )\n\nLet me compute denominator first: 2 * 3.0178e-27 = 6.0356e-27. Multiply that by 4e-20: 6.0356e-27 *4e-20 = 2.414e-46 kg m\u00b2.\n\nSo B = 1.05457e-34 / 2.414e-46 \u2248 (1.05457 / 2.414) * 1e12 \u2248 approx 0.437 * 1e12 = 4.37e11?",

The next lowest energy state could be either v=1 (first vibrational excited state) or J=1 (first rotational excited state). The energy of the vibrational state is higher. Let me calculate the energy differences for both possibilities and see which is lower. The photon's energy would be the difference between the two states.\n\nFirst, the vibrational energy difference. For a harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are (v + 1/2) h\u03c9. The ground state is v=0, so the first excited state is v=1. The energy difference is h\u03c9. \n\nThe rotational energy levels are given by Erot = B J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The ground state is J=0, so the first excited state is J=1. The energy difference is B(1*2) - B(0) = 2B. \n\nSo, which is smaller? To compare, we need to compute both. Let's see the given data. Let's compute B first. \n\nThe rotational constant B is (h/(8\u03c0\u00b2I)), where I is the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia I = \u03bc R\u00b2, where \u03bc is the reduced mass. \n\nGiven the masses of X and Y as 20 amu and 2 amu, so \u03bc = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 \u2248 1.818 amu. Convert that to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So \u03bc \u2248 1.818 * 1.66e-27 \u2248 let me calculate that. 1.818 * 1.66 \u2248 3.02, so 3.02e-27 kg. \n\nThe bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. \n\nSo I = \u03bc R\u00b2 = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2. Let's compute that: (2e-10)^2 =4e-20, so I = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg\u00b7m\u00b2. \n\nThen B = h/(8\u03c0\u00b2 I). h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s. Let's plug in the numbers:\n\nB = 6.626e-34 / (8 * \u03c0\u00b2 * 1.208e-46). \n\nFirst compute denominator: 8 * \u03c0\u00b2 \u2248 8 * 9.8696 \u2248 78.9568; then multiply by 1.208e-46: 78.9568 * 1.208e-46 \u2248 95.33e-46. \n\nSo B \u2248 6.626e-34 / 95.33e-46 = (6.626 / 95.33) * 1e12 \u2248 0.0695 *1e12 \u2248 6.95e10?",

The rotational energy levels are given by Erot = B J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The transition from J=0 to J=1 would have \u0394E_rot = B(1*2 - 0*1) = 2B. So I need to compare \u0127\u03c9 and 2B.\n\nIf the vibrational energy is higher than the rotational, then the lowest energy transition would be rotational. But if the rotational transition requires less energy, then the photon would have to have that energy. But the problem states that the molecule is in the fundamental state. Let me check the given parameters to see which is smaller.\n\nThe problem gives the bond length R = 2 angstroms (so 2e-10 meters), masses of X and Y are 20 and 2 amu. Let me compute B first. The rotational constant B is (\u0127/(2\u03bcR\u00b2)), where \u03bc is the reduced mass. Let me compute \u03bc.\n\nThe reduced mass \u03bc = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So \u03bc = (20*2)/(22) = 40/22 \u2248 1.818 amu. Convert that to kg: 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So \u03bc \u2248 1.818 * 1.66e-27 \u2248 let's calculate that. 1.818 * 1.66 is roughly 1.818*1.6=2.9088, plus 1.818*0.06=0.109, so total \u2248 3.0178e-27 kg.\n\nThen B = \u0127/(2\u03bc R\u00b2). Let me compute R squared first. R is 2e-10 m, so R\u00b2 is 4e-20 m\u00b2. Plugging in numbers:\n\n\u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nSo B = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 3.0178e-27 kg * 4e-20 m\u00b2 )\n\nLet me compute denominator first: 2 * 3.0178e-27 = 6.0356e-27. Multiply that by 4e-20: 6.0356e-27 *4e-20 = 2.414e-46 kg m\u00b2.\n\nSo B = 1.05457e-34 / 2.414e-46 \u2248 (1.05457 / 2.414) * 1e12 \u2248 approx 0.437 * 1e12 = 4.37e11?",

The next lowest energy state could be either v=1 (first vibrational excited state) or J=1 (first rotational excited state). The energy of the vibrational state is higher. Let me calculate the energy differences for both possibilities and see which is lower. The photon's energy would be the difference between the two states.\n\nFirst, the vibrational energy difference. For a harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are (v + 1/2) h\u03c9. The ground state is v=0, so the first excited state is v=1. The energy difference is h\u03c9. \n\nThe rotational energy levels are given by Erot = B J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The ground state is J=0, so the first excited state is J=1. The energy difference is B(1*2) - B(0) = 2B. \n\nSo, which is smaller? To compare, we need to compute both. Let's see the given data. Let's compute B first. \n\nThe rotational constant B is (h/(8\u03c0\u00b2I)), where I is the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia I = \u03bc R\u00b2, where \u03bc is the reduced mass. \n\nGiven the masses of X and Y as 20 amu and 2 amu, so \u03bc = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 \u2248 1.818 amu. Convert that to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So \u03bc \u2248 1.818 * 1.66e-27 \u2248 let me calculate that. 1.818 * 1.66 \u2248 3.02, so 3.02e-27 kg. \n\nThe bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. \n\nSo I = \u03bc R\u00b2 = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2. Let's compute that: (2e-10)^2 =4e-20, so I = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg\u00b7m\u00b2. \n\nThen B = h/(8\u03c0\u00b2 I). h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s. Let's plug in the numbers:\n\nB = 6.626e-34 / (8 * \u03c0\u00b2 * 1.208e-46). \n\nFirst compute denominator: 8 * \u03c0\u00b2 \u2248 8 * 9.8696 \u2248 78.9568; then multiply by 1.208e-46: 78.9568 * 1.208e-46 \u2248 95.33e-46. \n\nSo B \u2248 6.626e-34 / 95.33e-46 = (6.626 / 95.33) * 1e12 \u2248 0.0695 *1e12 \u2248 6.95e10?",

The rotational energy levels are given by Erot = B J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The transition from J=0 to J=1 would have \u0394E_rot = B(1*2 - 0*1) = 2B. So I need to compare \u0127\u03c9 and 2B.\n\nIf the vibrational energy is higher than the rotational, then the lowest energy transition would be rotational. But if the rotational transition requires less energy, then the photon would have to have that energy. But the problem states that the molecule is in the fundamental state. Let me check the given parameters to see which is smaller.\n\nThe problem gives the bond length R = 2 angstroms (so 2e-10 meters), masses of X and Y are 20 and 2 amu. Let me compute B first. The rotational constant B is (\u0127/(2\u03bcR\u00b2)), where \u03bc is the reduced mass. Let me compute \u03bc.\n\nThe reduced mass \u03bc = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So \u03bc = (20*2)/(22) = 40/22 \u2248 1.818 amu. Convert that to kg: 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So \u03bc \u2248 1.818 * 1.66e-27 \u2248 let's calculate that. 1.818 * 1.66 is roughly 1.818*1.6=2.9088, plus 1.818*0.06=0.109, so total \u2248 3.0178e-27 kg.\n\nThen B = \u0127/(2\u03bc R\u00b2). Let me compute R squared first. R is 2e-10 m, so R\u00b2 is 4e-20 m\u00b2. Plugging in numbers:\n\n\u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nSo B = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 3.0178e-27 kg * 4e-20 m\u00b2 )\n\nLet me compute denominator first: 2 * 3.0178e-27 = 6.0356e-27. Multiply that by 4e-20: 6.0356e-27 *4e-20 = 2.414e-46 kg m\u00b2.\n\nSo B = 1.05457e-34 / 2.414e-46 \u2248 (1.05457 / 2.414) * 1e12 \u2248 approx 0.437 * 1e12 = 4.37e11?",

The next lowest energy state could be either v=1 (first vibrational excited state) or J=1 (first rotational excited state). The energy of the vibrational state is higher. Let me calculate the energy differences for both possibilities and see which is lower. The photon's energy would be the difference between the two states.\n\nFirst, the vibrational energy difference. For a harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are (v + 1/2) h\u03c9. The ground state is v=0, so the first excited state is v=1. The energy difference is h\u03c9. \n\nThe rotational energy levels are given by Erot = B J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The ground state is J=0, so the first excited state is J=1. The energy difference is B(1*2) - B(0) = 2B. \n\nSo, which is smaller? To compare, we need to compute both. Let's see the given data. Let's compute B first. \n\nThe rotational constant B is (h/(8\u03c0\u00b2I)), where I is the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia I = \u03bc R\u00b2, where \u03bc is the reduced mass. \n\nGiven the masses of X and Y as 20 amu and 2 amu, so \u03bc = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 \u2248 1.818 amu. Convert that to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So \u03bc \u2248 1.818 * 1.66e-27 \u2248 let me calculate that. 1.818 * 1.66 \u2248 3.02, so 3.02e-27 kg. \n\nThe bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. \n\nSo I = \u03bc R\u00b2 = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2. Let's compute that: (2e-10)^2 =4e-20, so I = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg\u00b7m\u00b2. \n\nThen B = h/(8\u03c0\u00b2 I). h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s. Let's plug in the numbers:\n\nB = 6.626e-34 / (8 * \u03c0\u00b2 * 1.208e-46). \n\nFirst compute denominator: 8 * \u03c0\u00b2 \u2248 8 * 9.8696 \u2248 78.9568; then multiply by 1.208e-46: 78.9568 * 1.208e-46 \u2248 95.33e-46. \n\nSo B \u2248 6.626e-34 / 95.33e-46 = (6.626 / 95.33) * 1e12 \u2248 0.0695 *1e12 \u2248 6.95e10?",

The rotational energy levels are given by Erot = B J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The transition from J=0 to J=1 would have \u0394E_rot = B(1*2 - 0*1) = 2B. So I need to compare \u0127\u03c9 and 2B.\n\nIf the vibrational energy is higher than the rotational, then the lowest energy transition would be rotational. But if the rotational transition requires less energy, then the photon would have to have that energy. But the problem states that the molecule is in the fundamental state. Let me check the given parameters to see which is smaller.\n\nThe problem gives the bond length R = 2 angstroms (so 2e-10 meters), masses of X and Y are 20 and 2 amu. Let me compute B first. The rotational constant B is (\u0127/(2\u03bcR\u00b2)), where \u03bc is the reduced mass. Let me compute \u03bc.\n\nThe reduced mass \u03bc = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So \u03bc = (20*2)/(22) = 40/22 \u2248 1.818 amu. Convert that to kg: 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So \u03bc \u2248 1.818 * 1.66e-27 \u2248 let's calculate that. 1.818 * 1.66 is roughly 1.818*1.6=2.9088, plus 1.818*0.06=0.109, so total \u2248 3.0178e-27 kg.\n\nThen B = \u0127/(2\u03bc R\u00b2). Let me compute R squared first. R is 2e-10 m, so R\u00b2 is 4e-20 m\u00b2. Plugging in numbers:\n\n\u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nSo B = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 3.0178e-27 kg * 4e-20 m\u00b2 )\n\nLet me compute denominator first: 2 * 3.0178e-27 = 6.0356e-27. Multiply that by 4e-20: 6.0356e-27 *4e-20 = 2.414e-46 kg m\u00b2.\n\nSo B = 1.05457e-34 / 2.414e-46 \u2248 (1.05457 / 2.414) * 1e12 \u2248 approx 0.437 * 1e12 = 4.37e11?",

The next lowest energy state could be either v=1 (first vibrational excited state) or J=1 (first rotational excited state). The energy of the vibrational state is higher. Let me calculate the energy differences for both possibilities and see which is lower. The photon's energy would be the difference between the two states.\n\nFirst, the vibrational energy difference. For a harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are (v + 1/2) h\u03c9. The ground state is v=0, so the first excited state is v=1. The energy difference is h\u03c9. \n\nThe rotational energy levels are given by Erot = B J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The ground state is J=0, so the first excited state is J=1. The energy difference is B(1*2) - B(0) = 2B. \n\nSo, which is smaller? To compare, we need to compute both. Let's see the given data. Let's compute B first. \n\nThe rotational constant B is (h/(8\u03c0\u00b2I)), where I is the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia I = \u03bc R\u00b2, where \u03bc is the reduced mass. \n\nGiven the masses of X and Y as 20 amu and 2 amu, so \u03bc = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 \u2248 1.818 amu. Convert that to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So \u03bc \u2248 1.818 * 1.66e-27 \u2248 let me calculate that. 1.818 * 1.66 \u2248 3.02, so 3.02e-27 kg. \n\nThe bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. \n\nSo I = \u03bc R\u00b2 = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2. Let's compute that: (2e-10)^2 =4e-20, so I = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg\u00b7m\u00b2. \n\nThen B = h/(8\u03c0\u00b2 I). h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s. Let's plug in the numbers:\n\nB = 6.626e-34 / (8 * \u03c0\u00b2 * 1.208e-46). \n\nFirst compute denominator: 8 * \u03c0\u00b2 \u2248 8 * 9.8696 \u2248 78.9568; then multiply by 1.208e-46: 78.9568 * 1.208e-46 \u2248 95.33e-46. \n\nSo B \u2248 6.626e-34 / 95.33e-46 = (6.626 / 95.33) * 1e12 \u2248 0.0695 *1e12 \u2248 6.95e10?",

The rotational energy levels are given by Erot = B J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The transition from J=0 to J=1 would have \u0394E_rot = B(1*2 - 0*1) = 2B. So I need to compare \u0127\u03c9 and 2B.\n\nIf the vibrational energy is higher than the rotational, then the lowest energy transition would be rotational. But if the rotational transition requires less energy, then the photon would have to have that energy. But the problem states that the molecule is in the fundamental state. Let me check the given parameters to see which is smaller.\n\nThe problem gives the bond length R = 2 angstroms (so 2e-10 meters), masses of X and Y are 20 and 2 amu. Let me compute B first. The rotational constant B is (\u0127/(2\u03bcR\u00b2)), where \u03bc is the reduced mass. Let me compute \u03bc.\n\nThe reduced mass \u03bc = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So \u03bc = (20*2)/(22) = 40/22 \u2248 1.818 amu. Convert that to kg: 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So \u03bc \u2248 1.818 * 1.66e-27 \u2248 let's calculate that. 1.818 * 1.66 is roughly 1.818*1.6=2.9088, plus 1.818*0.06=0.109, so total \u2248 3.0178e-27 kg.\n\nThen B = \u0127/(2\u03bc R\u00b2). Let me compute R squared first. R is 2e-10 m, so R\u00b2 is 4e-20 m\u00b2. Plugging in numbers:\n\n\u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nSo B = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 3.0178e-27 kg * 4e-20 m\u00b2 )\n\nLet me compute denominator first: 2 * 3.0178e-27 = 6.0356e-27. Multiply that by 4e-20: 6.0356e-27 *4e-20 = 2.414e-46 kg m\u00b2.\n\nSo B = 1.05457e-34 / 2.414e-46 \u2248 (1.05457 / 2.414) * 1e12 \u2248 approx 0.437 * 1e12 = 4.37e11?",
