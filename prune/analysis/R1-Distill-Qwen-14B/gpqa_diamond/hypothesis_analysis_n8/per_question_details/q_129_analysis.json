B \u2192 C with H2 and Pd: Hydrogenation. If B is a cyanohydrin (like a diol nitrile?), but wait, the structure would have adjacent -OH and -CN groups. Hydrogenation under Pd would typically hydrogenate triple bonds, double bonds, or maybe nitriles. So maybe the nitrile group is being hydrogenated. Nitriles (R-CN) upon catalytic hydrogenation (H2, Pd) are reduced to amines (R-CH2-NH2). But that would add two H's to the nitrile, turning it into a primary amine.",

B \u2192 C with H2 and Pd: Hydrogenation. If B is a cyanohydrin (like a diol nitrile?), but wait, the structure would have adjacent -OH and -CN groups. Hydrogenation under Pd would typically hydrogenate triple bonds, double bonds, or maybe nitriles. So maybe the nitrile group is being hydrogenated. Nitriles (R-CN) upon catalytic hydrogenation (H2, Pd) are reduced to amines (R-CH2-NH2). But that would add two H's to the nitrile, turning it into a primary amine.",
