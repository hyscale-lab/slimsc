          "text1": "Wait, let me get that right. So, the velocity of astronaut 2 as seen from astronaut 1's frame would be (u' = (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v2 v1)/(c\u00b2)))), right? Because astronaut 2's speed in the original frame is v2 = 0.5c, and the frame (astronaut 1's) speed is v1 = 0.6c. So u' is (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c\u00b2)).\n\nCalculating numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. The denominator: 1 - (0.3 c\u00b2)/(c\u00b2) )= 1 - 0.3= 0.7. So u' is (-0.1c)/(0.7) = approximately -0.142857c. The negative sign indicates direction but since the question asks for speed, it's 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. Hmm, looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c. So that's one part.\n\nNow, the other part is the total energy of the system. The total energy includes the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy, but wait, in relativity, the total energy is the sum of the energies of each astronaut when considering their relativistic speeds.\n\nEach astronaut's total energy is given by gamma multiplied by m c squared. So for astronaut 1 (mass 2m, speed 0.6c), his energy E1 is gamma1 * 2m c\u00b2. Similarly, E2 is gamma2 * 3m c\u00b2.\n\nCalculating gamma for each: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)).\n\nFor astronaut 1: v = 0.6c. So v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) = 0.8. So gamma1 is 1 / 0.8 = 1.25.\n\nE1 = 1.25 * 2m c\u00b2 = 2.5 m c\u00b2.\n\nAstronaut 2: v=0.5c. v\u00b2/c\u00b2=0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)=sqrt(3/4)=sqrt(3)/2\u22480.8660. So gamma2=1/(0.8660) \u2248 1.1547.\n\nE2=1.1547 *3m c\u00b2 \u2248 3.4641 m c\u00b2.\n\nAdding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 m c\u00b2. So approximately 5.96 m c\u00b2.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 m c\u00b2 and v_rel=0.14c. So option C is correct.",
          "text2": "Wait, no, the relative speed when one is moving at u and another at v in the same direction would be (u - v) divided by (1 - (u v)/(c\u00b2)).\n\nSo let's plug in the numbers: u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. So numerator is 0.1c. Denominator is 1 minus (0.6*0.5) which is 1 minus 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed should be around 0.14c. Let me see the options: option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.\n\nNow, for the total energy. Total energy in relativity includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The energy of each astronaut is given by gamma multiplied by their rest mass energy. The rest mass energy is mc\u00b2 for each, but wait, the masses here are 2m and 3m, right?\n\nSo for the first astronaut, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2 ) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So each astronaut has their own relativistic energy. So the total energy would be the sum of their energies.\n\nThe energy of each is gamma multiplied by m c squared. So for each, calculate gamma (Lorentz factor) and multiply by their mass, then sum.\n\nSo for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):\n\nGamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.\n\nSo energy1 = gamma1 * 2m c\u00b2 = 1.25 * 2m c\u00b2 = 2.5 m c\u00b2.\n\nSecond astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):\n\nGamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) \u2248 1.1547.\n\nEnergy2 = gamma2 * 3m c\u00b2 \u2248 1.1547 * 3m c\u00b2 \u2248 3.464 m c\u00b2.\n\nSo total energy E = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c\u00b2. That's approximately 5.96 m c\u00b2. So looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc\u00b2, and option D says E=5 mc\u00b2. So option C has E=5.96 mc\u00b2, and v_rel=0.14c.

          "text2": "Alternatively, could I have mixed up the order? Because if you take v as the 2m's speed and u as the 3m's, then the formula would give (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5*0.6)) which gives negative 0.1c / 0.7, so that's -0.14c. But relative speed is a magnitude, so it's 0.14c either way. So the relative speed is about 0.14c, which is option C and D.\n\nNow, the second part is the total energy of the system. I think the total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. So the formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m c\u00b2, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nSo for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c), gamma would be 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

Because astronaut 2's speed in the original frame is v2 = 0.5c, and the frame (astronaut 1's) speed is v1 = 0.6c. So u' is (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c\u00b2)).\n\nCalculating numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. The denominator: 1 - (0.3 c\u00b2)/(c\u00b2) )= 1 - 0.3= 0.7. So u' is (-0.1c)/(0.7) = approximately -0.142857c. The negative sign indicates direction but since the question asks for speed, it's 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. Hmm, looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c. So that's one part.\n\nNow, the other part is the total energy of the system. The total energy includes the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy, but wait, in relativity, the total energy is the sum of the energies of each astronaut when considering their relativistic speeds.\n\nEach astronaut's total energy is given by gamma multiplied by m c squared. So for astronaut 1 (mass 2m, speed 0.6c), his energy E1 is gamma1 * 2m c\u00b2. Similarly, E2 is gamma2 * 3m c\u00b2.\n\nCalculating gamma for each: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)).\n\nFor astronaut 1: v = 0.6c. So v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) = 0.8. So gamma1 is 1 / 0.8 = 1.25.\n\nE1 = 1.25 * 2m c\u00b2 = 2.5 m c\u00b2.\n\nAstronaut 2: v=0.5c. v\u00b2/c\u00b2=0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)=sqrt(3/4)=sqrt(3)/2\u22480.8660.

So approximately 5.96 m c\u00b2.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 m c\u00b2 and v_rel=0.14c. So option C is correct.",
          "text2": "Wait, no, the relative speed when one is moving at u and another at v in the same direction would be (u - v) divided by (1 - (u v)/(c\u00b2)).\n\nSo let's plug in the numbers: u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. So numerator is 0.1c. Denominator is 1 minus (0.6*0.5) which is 1 minus 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed should be around 0.14c. Let me see the options: option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.\n\nNow, for the total energy. Total energy in relativity includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The energy of each astronaut is given by gamma multiplied by their rest mass energy. The rest mass energy is mc\u00b2 for each, but wait, the masses here are 2m and 3m, right?\n\nSo for the first astronaut, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2 ) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

Because astronaut 2's speed in the original frame is v2 = 0.5c, and the frame (astronaut 1's) speed is v1 = 0.6c. So u' is (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c\u00b2)).\n\nCalculating numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. The denominator: 1 - (0.3 c\u00b2)/(c\u00b2) )= 1 - 0.3= 0.7. So u' is (-0.1c)/(0.7) = approximately -0.142857c. The negative sign indicates direction but since the question asks for speed, it's 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. Hmm, looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c. So that's one part.\n\nNow, the other part is the total energy of the system. The total energy includes the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy, but wait, in relativity, the total energy is the sum of the energies of each astronaut when considering their relativistic speeds.\n\nEach astronaut's total energy is given by gamma multiplied by m c squared. So for astronaut 1 (mass 2m, speed 0.6c), his energy E1 is gamma1 * 2m c\u00b2. Similarly, E2 is gamma2 * 3m c\u00b2.\n\nCalculating gamma for each: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)).\n\nFor astronaut 1: v = 0.6c. So v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) = 0.8. So gamma1 is 1 / 0.8 = 1.25.\n\nE1 = 1.25 * 2m c\u00b2 = 2.5 m c\u00b2.\n\nAstronaut 2: v=0.5c. v\u00b2/c\u00b2=0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)=sqrt(3/4)=sqrt(3)/2\u22480.8660. So gamma2=1/(0.8660) \u2248 1.1547.\n\nE2=1.1547 *3m c\u00b2 \u2248 3.4641 m c\u00b2.\n\nAdding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 m c\u00b2. So approximately 5.96 m c\u00b2.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 m c\u00b2 and v_rel=0.14c. So option C is correct.",
          "text2": "Wait, no, the relative speed when one is moving at u and another at v in the same direction would be (u - v) divided by (1 - (u v)/(c\u00b2)).\n\nSo let's plug in the numbers: u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. So numerator is 0.1c. Denominator is 1 minus (0.6*0.5) which is 1 minus 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed should be around 0.14c. Let me see the options: option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.\n\nNow, for the total energy. Total energy in relativity includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The energy of each astronaut is given by gamma multiplied by their rest mass energy. The rest mass energy is mc\u00b2 for each, but wait, the masses here are 2m and 3m, right?\n\nSo for the first astronaut, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2 ) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

Because astronaut 2's speed in the original frame is v2 = 0.5c, and the frame (astronaut 1's) speed is v1 = 0.6c. So u' is (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c\u00b2)).\n\nCalculating numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. The denominator: 1 - (0.3 c\u00b2)/(c\u00b2) )= 1 - 0.3= 0.7. So u' is (-0.1c)/(0.7) = approximately -0.142857c. The negative sign indicates direction but since the question asks for speed, it's 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. Hmm, looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c. So that's one part.\n\nNow, the other part is the total energy of the system. The total energy includes the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy, but wait, in relativity, the total energy is the sum of the energies of each astronaut when considering their relativistic speeds.\n\nEach astronaut's total energy is given by gamma multiplied by m c squared. So for astronaut 1 (mass 2m, speed 0.6c), his energy E1 is gamma1 * 2m c\u00b2. Similarly, E2 is gamma2 * 3m c\u00b2.\n\nCalculating gamma for each: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)).\n\nFor astronaut 1: v = 0.6c. So v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) = 0.8. So gamma1 is 1 / 0.8 = 1.25.\n\nE1 = 1.25 * 2m c\u00b2 = 2.5 m c\u00b2.\n\nAstronaut 2: v=0.5c. v\u00b2/c\u00b2=0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)=sqrt(3/4)=sqrt(3)/2\u22480.8660. So gamma2=1/(0.8660) \u2248 1.1547.\n\nE2=1.1547 *3m c\u00b2 \u2248 3.4641 m c\u00b2.\n\nAdding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 m c\u00b2. So approximately 5.96 m c\u00b2.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 m c\u00b2 and v_rel=0.14c. So option C is correct.",
          "text2": "Wait, no, the relative speed when one is moving at u and another at v in the same direction would be (u - v) divided by (1 - (u v)/(c\u00b2)).\n\nSo let's plug in the numbers: u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. So numerator is 0.1c. Denominator is 1 minus (0.6*0.5) which is 1 minus 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed should be around 0.14c. Let me see the options: option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.\n\nNow, for the total energy. Total energy in relativity includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The energy of each astronaut is given by gamma multiplied by their rest mass energy. The rest mass energy is mc\u00b2 for each, but wait, the masses here are 2m and 3m, right?\n\nSo for the first astronaut, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2 ) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So each astronaut has their own relativistic energy. So the total energy would be the sum of their energies.\n\nThe energy of each is gamma multiplied by m c squared.
