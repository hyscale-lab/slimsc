So dividing them gives (a2/a4)^0.5. So I need the ratio of their orbital distances, then take the square root of (a2/a4) for the temperature ratio.\n\nBut how to find a2 and a4? The problem gives the orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for the five planets. So Planet_1 has period P1 = 1 unit, Planet_2 is 2, Planet_3 is 2.5, Planet_4 is 3.5, and Planet_5 is 5. \n\nWe need to relate the orbital periods to their semi-major axes. Kepler's third law: P\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3, assuming the same central mass. So (P4/P2)\u00b2 = (a4/a2)^3. Therefore, (a4/a2) = (P4/P2)^(2/3). \n\nGiven P4 is 3.5 and P2 is 2. So P4/P2 = 3.5/2 = 1.75. \n\nSo (a4/a2) = (1.75)^(2/3). Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, 1.75 is 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3). Let me calculate this value.",

Let me clarify which is which.\n\nThe planets are labeled Planet_1 through Planet_5 with orbital periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has period P1 = 1 (unitless ratio), Planet_2 has P2=2, Planet_3 is 2.5, Planet_4 is 3.5, and Planet_5 is 5. The question is about Planet_4 and Planet_2. So we need T4 / T2.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star. Since the orbital period relates to distance via Kepler's third law. For a circular orbit around a star of mass M, the period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed (P^2 \u221d a^3). Therefore, a \u221d P^(2/3). \n\nSo the distance a is proportional to the period raised to the 2/3 power. \n\nTherefore, the ratio of the distances a4/a2 would be (P4/P2)^(2/3). \n\nSo substituting the given periods, P4 is 3.5 and P2 is 2. \n\nCalculating that ratio: 3.5 / 2 = 1.75.

So dividing them gives (a2/a4)^0.5. So I need the ratio of their orbital distances, then take the square root of (a2/a4) for the temperature ratio.\n\nBut how to find a2 and a4? The problem gives the orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for the five planets. So Planet_1 has period P1 = 1 unit, Planet_2 is 2, Planet_3 is 2.5, Planet_4 is 3.5, and Planet_5 is 5. \n\nWe need to relate the orbital periods to their semi-major axes. Kepler's third law: P\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3, assuming the same central mass. So (P4/P2)\u00b2 = (a4/a2)^3. Therefore, (a4/a2) = (P4/P2)^(2/3). \n\nGiven P4 is 3.5 and P2 is 2.

So Planet_1 has period P1 = 1 (unitless ratio), Planet_2 has P2=2, Planet_3 is 2.5, Planet_4 is 3.5, and Planet_5 is 5. The question is about Planet_4 and Planet_2. So we need T4 / T2.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star. Since the orbital period relates to distance via Kepler's third law. For a circular orbit around a star of mass M, the period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed (P^2 \u221d a^3). Therefore, a \u221d P^(2/3). \n\nSo the distance a is proportional to the period raised to the 2/3 power. \n\nTherefore, the ratio of the distances a4/a2 would be (P4/P2)^(2/3). \n\nSo substituting the given periods, P4 is 3.5 and P2 is 2. \n\nCalculating that ratio: 3.5 / 2 = 1.75.

So Planet_1 has period P1 = 1 (unitless ratio), Planet_2 has P2=2, Planet_3 is 2.5, Planet_4 is 3.5, and Planet_5 is 5. The question is about Planet_4 and Planet_2. So we need T4 / T2.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star. Since the orbital period relates to distance via Kepler's third law. For a circular orbit around a star of mass M, the period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed (P^2 \u221d a^3). Therefore, a \u221d P^(2/3). \n\nSo the distance a is proportional to the period raised to the 2/3 power. \n\nTherefore, the ratio of the distances a4/a2 would be (P4/P2)^(2/3). \n\nSo substituting the given periods, P4 is 3.5 and P2 is 2. \n\nCalculating that ratio: 3.5 / 2 = 1.75.

Kepler's third law: P\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3, assuming the same central mass. So (P4/P2)\u00b2 = (a4/a2)^3. Therefore, (a4/a2) = (P4/P2)^(2/3). \n\nGiven P4 is 3.5 and P2 is 2.

          "text1": "Wait, but I might have messed up the exponents. Let me check again. Let me write it step by step.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature is proportional to ( L/(D^2) )^(1/4) multiplied by sqrt( (1 - A) ), but since (1 - A) is same, that cancels. So T is proportional to (L/D^2)^(1/4). Since L is same for both, the ratio T4/T2 is ( (1/D4^2) / (1/D2^2) )^(1/4) ) = (D2^2 / D4^2)^(1/4) = (D2/D4)^(2*(1/4)) = (D2/D4)^(1/2) = sqrt(D2/D4). \n\nTherefore, the ratio T4/T2 = sqrt( D2 / D4 ). \n\nSo the key now is to find D2 and D4, the orbital distances of Planet 2 and 4. But how?\n\nThe problem states that the orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 has P2 = 2*P1, Planet_3 is 2.5*P1, Planet_4 is 3.5*P1, and Planet_5 is 5*P1. \n\nWe can use Kepler's third law, which relates orbital period squared to semi-major axis cubed. The formula is P^2 \u221d a^3, where a is the semi-major axis. So (P4 / P2)^2 = (a4^3 / a2^3).",
          "text2": "Wait, no, need to check. Let me rephrase:\n\nSuppose Planet 2 is at distance a2, Planet4 at a4, then T4/T2 = sqrt( (a2/a4) ), because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So the ratio of their temperatures (T4 divided by T2) is sqrt( a2 / a4 ), because T4 = k / sqrt(a4), T2 = k / sqrt(a2). So T4 / T2 = sqrt(a2/a4).\n\nTherefore, the key is to find the ratio of their orbital distances, then take the square root of (a2/a4).\n\nBut how do we get the orbital distances from the orbital periods? Oh, Kepler's third law! For circular orbits around the same star, the orbital period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed. So (P1/P2)^2 = (a1/a2)^3. So if we can get the ratio of their orbital periods, we can find the ratio of their distances.\n\nThe orbital periods are given as Planet_1 to Planet_5 in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So let's note down their periods:\n\nPlanet_1: P1 = 1 unit,\n\nPlanet_2: P2 = 2,\n\nPlanet_3: 2.5,\n\nPlanet_4: 3.5,\n\nPlanet_5:5.\n\nWe need P4 and P2's periods to find their distances.\n\nSo for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n\nP2 = 2,\n\nP4 = 3.5.\n\nSo according to Kepler's third law, (P4/P2)^2 = (a4/a2)^3.\n\nTherefore, (a4/a2) = (P4/P2)^(2/3).\n\nSo let's compute (3.5 / 2) raised to the 2/3 power.\n\nFirst, 3.5 divided by 2 is 1.75.\n\nSo 1.75^(2/3). Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, take natural logarithm of 1.75: ln(1.75) \u2248 0.5596.\n\nMultiply by 2/3: 0.5596 * (2/3) \u2248 0.373.\n\nExponentiate: e^0.373 \u2248 1.452.",
