So, if we take the minimum uncertainty, then \u0394p \u2248 h/(4\u03c0\u0394x). \n\nLet me plug in the numbers. The given \u0394x is 0.1 nm, which is 0.1 x 10^-9 meters. Let me compute the value of h divided by 4\u03c0 times 0.1e-9. \n\nThe Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J\u00b7s.
