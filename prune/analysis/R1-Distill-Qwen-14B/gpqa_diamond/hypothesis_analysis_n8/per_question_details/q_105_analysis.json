So when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing a periodic change in brightness.\n\nBut how does this compare to the planet transit scenario?\n\nLet me think: when a planet transits, the dip in brightness is proportional to the area blocked, (Rpl/Rstar)^2. But with spots, the dip is due to the spots being cooler. So when the spots are facing us, the brightness is lower because those cooler regions are emitting less light.

Let me recheck.\n\nHemisphere area is 2\u03c0 R\u00b2. Filling factor is 20%, so spot area is 0.2 * 2\u03c0 R\u00b2 = 0.4 \u03c0 R\u00b2.\n\nYes, that's correct.",
