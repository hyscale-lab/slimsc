So when x is multiplied by that, it's 0.9x over x, so ratio 0.9, meaning the first complex is 0.9 times the free Co.

So the first complex's concentration is \u03b21 * x * s = 9*x*0.1. The free Co is x. The ratio of (CoSCN\u207a)/free Co is 9*0.1 =0.9. So when x is multiplied by that, it's 0.9x over x, so ratio 0.9, meaning the first complex is 0.9 times the free Co. So in the total, free Co would be x, and first complex is 0.9x, so their sum is 1.9x. Adding the other terms gives the denominator. \n\nHmm, but perhaps I should check with the actual value. Let's compute x first. Since x = 1e-2 / D. Where D is 2.3646. So x = 1e-2 / 2.3646 \u22484.23 x 10^-3. So the free Co is ~0.00423 M. The first complex is 9 * 0.00423 *0.1 = 0.0003807 M?",
          "text2": "Alternatively, perhaps we can approximate s \u2248 0.1 M, since SCN is in excess, so the free concentration is close to total? Let's check that assumption first.\n\nIf s \u2248 0.1, then let's plug that into the equations and see if the total Co adds up.\n\nLet me compute each term in the total Co equation:\n\nLet me denote x as [Co^2+] (free Co).\n\nTotal Co = x (free) + \u03b21 x s (first complex) + \u03b22 x s\u00b2 (second) + \u03b23 x s\u00b3 (third) + \u03b24 x s^4 (fourth) = 1e-2.\n\nIf s is 0.1, then:\n\nLet me compute each coefficient term:\n\nFor the first term: x*(1)\n\nSecond term: \u03b21 * s =9 * 0.1 =0.9 \u2192 multiplied by x gives 0.9x\n\nThird term: \u03b22*s\u00b2 =40*(0.01)=0.4 \u2192 0.4x\n\nFourth term: \u03b23*s^3 =63*(0.001)=0.063 \u2192 0.063x\n\nFifth term: \u03b24*s^4 =16*(0.0001)=0.0016 \u2192 0.0016x\n\nAdding all coefficients: 1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 \u2248 2.3646\n\nThus total Co concentration is x*(2.3646) = 1e-2 \u2192 x = (1e-2)/2.3646 \u2248 0.00423 M.\n\nSo the free Co^2+ would be ~0.00423 M.\n\nThen the free SCN- is s =0.1 M (as assumed). Let's check if the SCN total is correct:\n\nTotal SCN- is s + \u03b21x s + 2\u03b22x s\u00b2 + 3\u03b23x s\u00b3 +4\u03b24x s^4.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\ns =0.1,\n\n\u03b21x s = 9*(0.00423)*(0.1) = 9*0.000423 \u2248 0.003807,\n\n2\u03b22x s\u00b2 = 2*40*(0.00423)*(0.01) = 80 *0.00423 *0.01 \u2248 0.003384,\n\n3\u03b23x s\u00b3 =3*63*(0.00423)*(0.001) \u2192 3*63=189, 189*0.00423\u2248 0.798, multiplied by 0.001 \u2192 ~0.000798,\n\n4\u03b24x s^4 =4*16*(0.00423)*(0.0001) \u2192 64*0.00423 \u22480.2707, multiplied by 0.0001 \u2192 0.00002707\n\nAdding all these terms to s:\n\n0.1 +0.003807 +0.003384 +0.000798 +0.000027 \u2248 0.1079 (approx ~0.1079 M). But the total SCN- should be 0.1 M. So this is a problem. Our assumption that s =0.1 is not correct because when we plug in, the total SCN- comes out higher than 0.1. So the free SCN- must be lower than 0.1 M. Hmm. So the assumption was wrong. Therefore, s is actually less than 0.1.\n\nSo we need to solve the equations properly. Let me think how to proceed.\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1) x*(1 + \u03b21 s + \u03b22 s\u00b2 + \u03b23 s\u00b3 + \u03b24 s^4) = 0.01 (total Co)\n\n2) s + (\u03b21 x s + 2 \u03b22 x s\u00b2 + 3 \u03b23 x s\u00b3 +4 \u03b24 x s^4) =0.1 (total SCN)\n\nBut these are two equations with two variables x and s.

So those are the overall stability constants, not stepwise. Because for example, \u03b22 would be the product of the first and second stepwise constants. So yes, they are the overall ones.\n\nSo using the overall \u03b2 values, the concentration expressions are as above. So the total concentration of Co is:\n\n[Co\u00b2+] + \u03b21 [Co\u00b2+][SCN-] + \u03b22 [Co\u00b2+][SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [Co\u00b2+][SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [Co\u00b2+][SCN-]^4 = c(Co) = 1e-2.\n\nLet me factor out [Co\u00b2+]:\n\n[Co\u00b2+] [ 1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4 ] = 1e-2.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. The [SCN-] is 0.1 M. So let's compute each term inside the brackets:\n\nFirst, let me note \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16.\n\nCompute the terms:\n\nTerm1: 1 (from [Co\u00b2+] itself)\n\nTerm2: \u03b21 * [SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n\nTerm3: \u03b22 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\nTerm4: \u03b23 * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n\nTerm5: \u03b24 * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nAdding all these terms together:\n\n1 + 0.9 = 1.9\n\n+0.4 \u2192 2.3\n\n+0.063 \u2192 2.363\n\n+0.0016 \u2192 2.3646\n\nSo the entire bracketed term is approximately 2.3646.\n\nTherefore, [Co\u00b2+] = (1e-2) / 2.3646 \u2248 0.01 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.00423 M.",
