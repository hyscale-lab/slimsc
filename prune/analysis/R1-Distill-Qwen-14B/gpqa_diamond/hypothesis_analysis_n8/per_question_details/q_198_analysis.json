But the question specifically says the blue dithiocyanato complexes, so that's Co(SCN)_2^2+.\n\nSo the problem is to find the percentage of Co(SCN)_2^2+ in the solution. To do that, I need to calculate the distribution of all possible cobalt species in solution.\n\nThe approach I remember is to use the stability constants to find the fraction of each complex. The fractions depend on the concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN^- and the stability constants.\n\nThe general approach is to write the expressions for each complex's concentration, then sum them up to get the total concentration of cobalt, and then find the fraction of each complex.\n\nThe species present are: Co^2+, Co(SCN)^+, Co(SCN)_2^2+, Co(SCN)_3^2+, Co(SCN)_4^2\u2212 (maybe?).",

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- = 362880 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4\n\nBut since [Co^2+] is a part of each term, when considering the fractions, [Co^2+] will factor out. However, the sum of all species [Co^2+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is equal to the total Co concentration, c=1e-2 M.\n\nBut to find the fraction of each species, perhaps it's better to consider that the fraction f_n is equal to (\u03b21\u03b22...\u03b2n [SCN^-]^n ) divided by the sum over all possible n of (\u03b21...\u03b2n [SCN^-]^n )",
