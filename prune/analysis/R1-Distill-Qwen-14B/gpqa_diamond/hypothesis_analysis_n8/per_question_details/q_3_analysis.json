That might be better.\n\nLet me compute \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 first. Since |\u03c8\u27e9 is given in the \u03c3_z eigenbasis. The expectation of \u03c3_z is just the sum over the eigenvalues multiplied by the probabilities.

          "text1": "Wait the \u03c3_x matrix is:\n\n[ [0, 1],\n  [1, 0] ]\n\nSo multiplying \u03c3_x with the vector [0.5; \u221a3/2] gives:\n\nFirst component: 0*0.5 + 1*(\u221a3/2) = \u221a3/2\n\nSecond component: 1*0.5 +0*(\u221a3/2) =0.5\n\nSo \u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9 is [ \u221a3/2 , 0.5 ]^T. \n\nThen, the inner product \u27e8\u03c8| (which is [0.5, \u221a3/2 ]) with this vector is:\n\n0.5*(\u221a3/2) + (\u221a3/2)*(0.5) \u2192 same as before. \n\n0.5*(\u221a3/2) is (\u221a3)/4 and the second term is also (\u221a3)/4, so adding them gives \u221a3/2 \u22480.866. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nSo now, putting it all together. \n\nThe expectation value of 10\u03c3_z +5\u03c3_x is 10*(-0.5) +5*(\u221a3/2). \n\nCalculating each term:\n\n10*(-0.5) = -5\n\n5*(\u221a3/2) = (5 * 1.732)/2 \u2248 (8.66)/2 \u22484.33\n\nSo total expectation value is -5 +4.33 \u2248 -0.67?",
          "text2": "Wait, let me do it step by step. \n\nThe expectation value \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 is \u03c8* \u03c3_x \u03c8, where \u03c8 is a column vector. So:\n\nFirst, compute \u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9:\n\n\u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9 = [0 1; 1 0] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [ sqrt(3)/2 ; 0.5 ]\n\nThen, take the inner product with \u27e8\u03c8| (the conjugate transpose of |\u03c8\u27e9):\n\n\u27e8\u03c8 | \u03c3_x | \u03c8\u27e9 = [0.5 , sqrt(3)/2 ] * [ sqrt(3)/2 ; 0.5 ] \n\nMultiply the components:\n\n0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5) \n\nLet me calculate each term:\n\nFirst term: 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = (sqrt(3))/4\n\nSecond term: (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 = same as first term.
