The lifetime observed in the lab frame is \u03c4_lab = gamma * tau_rest.\n\nBecause from the lab frame, the particle is moving, so its lifetime is longer. So the decay length is v * tau_lab = v gamma tau_rest.\n\nSo I think I missed the gamma factor in the velocity calculation.\n\nSo let's recalculate.\n\nEarlier, I used v = beta c, and tau = tau_rest, which is incorrect. Instead, tau_lab = gamma * tau_rest.\n\nThus, the decay length L = v * tau_lab = beta c * gamma tau_rest.\n\nSo we need to compute beta gamma.",
