Let me compute sqrt(62.56) precisely. \n\n7.9^2 = 62.41. 7.91^2 = 62.41 + 2*7.9*0.01 +0.01\u00b2 = 62.41 +0.158 +0.0001 =62.5681. \n\nThe target is 62.56, so that's a bit less than 7.91. \n\nLet\u2019s see, let me calculate sqrt(62.56). Let me compute 7.91 squared is 62.5681. The target is 62.56, which is 0.0081 less. \n\nSo, approximate sqrt(62.56) as 7.91 - delta. \n\nLet delta be small. \n\n(7.91 - delta)^2 = 62.56 \n\nExpanding, 7.91\u00b2 - 2*7.91*delta + delta\u00b2 =62.56 \n\nWe have 62.5681 - 15.82 delta + delta\u00b2 =62.56 \n\nThus, -15.82 delta \u2248 62.56 -62.5681 = -0.0081 \n\nSo delta \u2248 (0.0081)/15.82 \u22480.000512. \n\nThus, sqrt(62.56)\u22487.91 -0.000512\u22487.9095. \n\nSo pc\u22487.9095 GeV. \n\nThus, v = pc/E = 7.9095/8 \u22480.9886875. \n\nSo v\u22480.98869c. \n\nSo that's very close to the previous value. \n\nThus, the velocity is still approximately 0.9887c. \n\nHmm, so that doesn't change much.",
          "text2": "Alternatively, compute 0.988^2: 0.988 *0.988 = (0.99 -0.002)^2 = (0.99)^2 - 2*0.99*0.002 + (0.002)^2 = 0.9801 - 0.00396 + 0.000004 ~ 0.97614. \n\nSo 0.988 gives 0.976, which is less than 0.9775. Let me try 0.989:\n\n0.989^2 = 0.978121. Oh, that's better. 0.989 squared is 0.9781. Since 0.9781 is higher than 0.9775, so the square root of 0.9775 is between 0.988 and 0.989. Let me do linear approximation. \n\nLet x = sqrt(0.9775). \n\nBetween 0.988 (0.9761) and 0.989 (0.9781). The desired value is 0.9775. The difference between 0.9781 and 0.9761 is 0.002. The target is 0.9775, which is 0.9775 -0.9761 = 0.0014 above the lower value. So fraction is 0.0014 /0.002 = 0.7. So approximate sqrt is 0.988 + 0.7*(0.001) = 0.9887. \n\nThus approximately 0.9887c. So v \u2248 0.9887c. \n\nBut maybe I can just keep it symbolic for now. \n\nSo velocity v = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) * c. \n\nNow, the mean lifetime \u03c4 is given by \u03c4 = \u0127/(\u0393). \n\nBut \u0393 is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.",

Let me do linear approximation. \n\nLet x = sqrt(0.9775). \n\nBetween 0.988 (0.9761) and 0.989 (0.9781). The desired value is 0.9775. The difference between 0.9781 and 0.9761 is 0.002. The target is 0.9775, which is 0.9775 -0.9761 = 0.0014 above the lower value. So fraction is 0.0014 /0.002 = 0.7. So approximate sqrt is 0.988 + 0.7*(0.001) = 0.9887. \n\nThus approximately 0.9887c. So v \u2248 0.9887c. \n\nBut maybe I can just keep it symbolic for now. \n\nSo velocity v = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) * c. \n\nNow, the mean lifetime \u03c4 is given by \u03c4 = \u0127/(\u0393). \n\nBut \u0393 is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.",
