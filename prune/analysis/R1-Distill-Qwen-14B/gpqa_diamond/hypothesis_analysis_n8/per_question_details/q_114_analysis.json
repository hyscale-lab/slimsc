To have CN\u207b in solution, the solution must be basic. Because if it's acidic, CN\u207b would protonate to form HCN. So the reaction needs to be under basic conditions. Therefore, the solvent should be basic. \n\nSo the reagents would be NaCN (which provides CN\u207b) and a base. But in the question, the other reagent is A. Since NaCN is already present, perhaps A is a base like NaOH? But the options for A are either H3O+ (acid) or NaHSO3 (which is Na+ and HSO3^-). \n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming the first reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. Let me re-examine the product. \n\nThe product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. \n\nButan-2-one is CH3-CO-CH2-CH3. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Then the alpha carbon (the other side) gets a negative charge, which is then protonated. The reagents here are NaCN and A. So perhaps A is an acid, like H3O+ (a proton source), to protonate the intermediate. The cyanohydrin would have the OH and CN groups on the same carbon (the original carbonyl carbon). Let me confirm.\n\nThe product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The original butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. That would be a cyanohydrin. The formula would be correct. So the reagents here are NaCN (provides CN-) and then an acid (H3O+) to protonate the intermediate. So A must be H3O+ (or another acid) to provide the proton. \n\nSo for the first part, A is H3O+ (option A or B). \n\nNow the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) \u2192 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. \n\nThe starting material has a nitrile group (CN), and the product has a carboxylic acid group (COOH).

Because in cyanohydrin formation, you can use HCN with a little acid, or maybe sodium cyanide with an acid like H3O+ (concentrated H2SO4 or something). Because NaCN would need to be protonated to release HCN. So maybe the A here is H3O+ to provide the acidic conditions. That makes sense. So the first reagent A is H3O+.\n\nNow the second reaction. The starting material is the nitrile (butanenitrile) and after reaction with B in water, it becomes a carboxylic acid. So converting a nitrile to a carboxylic acid typically requires hydrolysis. The common reagents for that are H2O with either HCl (acidic hydrolysis) or maybe NaOH and heating (basic hydrolysis), but here the options are B as HCl or acetic acid.",

To have CN\u207b in solution, the solution must be basic. Because if it's acidic, CN\u207b would protonate to form HCN. So the reaction needs to be under basic conditions.

Since NaCN is already present, perhaps A is a base like NaOH? But the options for A are either H3O+ (acid) or NaHSO3 (which is Na+ and HSO3^-). \n\nHmm, this is confusing.

Then the alpha carbon (the other side) gets a negative charge, which is then protonated. The reagents here are NaCN and A. So perhaps A is an acid, like H3O+ (a proton source), to protonate the intermediate. The cyanohydrin would have the OH and CN groups on the same carbon (the original carbonyl carbon). Let me confirm.\n\nThe product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The original butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. That would be a cyanohydrin.
