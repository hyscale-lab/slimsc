The quartet (4H) comes from two CH2 groups adjacent to CH3. \n\nPutting it all together, the structure must be 3,3-dimethylpentane. Let's see the NMR:\n\nThe two methyl groups (6H) are on the central carbon (Carbon3). Each of these methyl groups would have neighboring carbons (Carbon2 and Carbon4), which are CH2 groups with two H each. The CH2 groups (Carbon2 and 4) are adjacent to CH3 groups (Carbon1 and 5). So the CH2 groups at 2 and 4 would each have their protons next to a CH3 (three H?), wait Carbon1 is CH2?",

The triplet (0.9 ppm, 6H) suggests two methyl groups attached to a carbon that is adjacent to a carbon with two H's (since triplet comes from two neighboring H). The quartet (1.3 ppm, 4H) is a methylene group next to a methyl (three H's), so that quartet is from a CH2 adjacent to a CH3. \n\nPutting this together, maybe the structure is 3,3-dimethylpentane?",
