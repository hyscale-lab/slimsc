Since the options are in fm, then the formula must be f_im (the imaginary part) has units of length, so (1/k) times the sum (in unitless) gives a length. Therefore k must have units of inverse length.\n\nSo, k is the wave number, which is 2\u03c0 divided by the wavelength, so units of 1/length. So 1/k has units of length.

For relativistic case, the total energy is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ), so T = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) - m c^2. Let me rearrange that to find p.\n\nLet me denote m as the electron mass (0.511 MeV/c\u00b2). Let me set c=1 for units, so T = sqrt(p\u00b2 + m\u00b2) - m. Then sqrt(p\u00b2 + m\u00b2) = T + m. Squaring both sides: p\u00b2 + m\u00b2 = (T + m)^2 = T\u00b2 + 2 T m + m\u00b2. Subtract m\u00b2: p\u00b2 = T\u00b2 + 2 T m. Therefore p = sqrt(T\u00b2 + 2 T m). \n\nPlugging in T = 50 MeV, and m =0.511 MeV.
