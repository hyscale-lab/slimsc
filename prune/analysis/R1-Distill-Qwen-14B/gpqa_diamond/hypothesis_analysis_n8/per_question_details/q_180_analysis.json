To minimize the system's potential energy, the charges would arrange themselves in such a way that the potential energy is as low as possible.

Let's try to estimate that.\n\nAssuming that the 12 charges are arranged on a sphere of radius 2m, the distance between any two adjacent charges can be found using the formula for the edge length of a regular icosahedron. But perhaps it's easier to model the 12 charges as forming a regular icosahedron around the central charge. \n\nThe edge length (distance between two adjacent vertices) of a regular icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius R is given by:\n\nedge length = 2R * sin(\u03c0/5) \u2248 2R * 0.5878 \u2248 1.1756 R.\n\nSo R is 2m, so edge length is about 1.1756 * 2 = 2.3512 m.\n\nSo the distance between any two adjacent charges is approximately 2.35 meters. \n\nNow, the mutual potential energy between two charges is U = k*(2e)*(2e)/r = 4 k e^2 / r.\n\nSince there are 66 pairs among the 12 charges, each contributing 4 k e\u00b2 / r_ij.\n\nAssuming that each pair is at least 2.35 m apart, but actually, in a regular icosahedron, each pair (edge) is 2.35m, and the other pairs (non-adjacent) are farther apart, but for the sake of calculation, perhaps we can assume that all pairs are at the same distance, but that's not accurate.",

To minimize the system's potential energy, the charges would arrange themselves in such a way that the potential energy is as low as possible. Since all charges are positive, they repel each other, so the potential energy is minimized when they are as far apart as possible. \n\nBut in this setup, the 12 charges are fixed at a distance of 2m from P. So their configuration is fixed, and the mutual distances can't be increased beyond what their arrangement allows. Therefore, the mutual potential energy is fixed, and must be included.\n\nHmm, so maybe the mutual interactions contribute a significant part to the total potential energy. Let's try to estimate that.\n\nAssuming that the 12 charges are arranged on a sphere of radius 2m, the distance between any two adjacent charges can be found using the formula for the edge length of a regular icosahedron. But perhaps it's easier to model the 12 charges as forming a regular icosahedron around the central charge. \n\nThe edge length (distance between two adjacent vertices) of a regular icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius R is given by:\n\nedge length = 2R * sin(\u03c0/5) \u2248 2R * 0.5878 \u2248 1.1756 R.\n\nSo R is 2m, so edge length is about 1.1756 * 2 = 2.3512 m.\n\nSo the distance between any two adjacent charges is approximately 2.35 meters. \n\nNow, the mutual potential energy between two charges is U = k*(2e)*(2e)/r = 4 k e^2 / r.\n\nSince there are 66 pairs among the 12 charges, each contributing 4 k e\u00b2 / r_ij.\n\nAssuming that each pair is at least 2.35 m apart, but actually, in a regular icosahedron, each pair (edge) is 2.35m, and the other pairs (non-adjacent) are farther apart, but for the sake of calculation, perhaps we can assume that all pairs are at the same distance, but that's not accurate.",

To minimize the system's potential energy, the charges would arrange themselves in such a way that the potential energy is as low as possible. Since all charges are positive, they repel each other, so the potential energy is minimized when they are as far apart as possible. \n\nBut in this setup, the 12 charges are fixed at a distance of 2m from P. So their configuration is fixed, and the mutual distances can't be increased beyond what their arrangement allows. Therefore, the mutual potential energy is fixed, and must be included.\n\nHmm, so maybe the mutual interactions contribute a significant part to the total potential energy. Let's try to estimate that.\n\nAssuming that the 12 charges are arranged on a sphere of radius 2m, the distance between any two adjacent charges can be found using the formula for the edge length of a regular icosahedron. But perhaps it's easier to model the 12 charges as forming a regular icosahedron around the central charge. \n\nThe edge length (distance between two adjacent vertices) of a regular icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius R is given by:\n\nedge length = 2R * sin(\u03c0/5) \u2248 2R * 0.5878 \u2248 1.1756 R.\n\nSo R is 2m, so edge length is about 1.1756 * 2 = 2.3512 m.\n\nSo the distance between any two adjacent charges is approximately 2.35 meters. \n\nNow, the mutual potential energy between two charges is U = k*(2e)*(2e)/r = 4 k e^2 / r.\n\nSince there are 66 pairs among the 12 charges, each contributing 4 k e\u00b2 / r_ij.\n\nAssuming that each pair is at least 2.35 m apart, but actually, in a regular icosahedron, each pair (edge) is 2.35m, and the other pairs (non-adjacent) are farther apart, but for the sake of calculation, perhaps we can assume that all pairs are at the same distance, but that's not accurate.",
