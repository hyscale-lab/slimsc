Therefore pKa2 is 7.2076. \n\nThen, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02809 /0.03674 = 0.764. The log of that is log(0.764). Let me compute that. Since log(0.764) = log(7.64 *10^-1) = log(7.64) + (-1). Log(7.64) is about 0.883, so 0.883 -1 = -0.117. So pH = pKa2 + log(ratio) = 7.2076 -0.117 \u22487.0906. \n\n[H+] = 10^-7.0906.

Since log(0.764) = log(7.64 *10^-1) = log(7.64) + (-1). Log(7.64) is about 0.883, so 0.883 -1 = -0.117. So pH = pKa2 + log(ratio) = 7.2076 -0.117 \u22487.0906. \n\n[H+] = 10^-7.0906.

Then divided by 0.2 L gives 0.03673 M H2PO4^-.\n\nMoles of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1.00g /177.99g/mol = 0.005618 mol. Divided by 0.2 is 0.02809 M HPO4^2-.\n\npKa2 is -log(6.2e-8). Let me compute this exactly:\n\nlog(6.2e-8) is log(6.2) + log(1e-8). log(6.2) = 0.79239 (since 10^0.79239 \u2248 6.2). So log(6.2e-8) = 0.79239 -8 = -7.2076. Therefore pKa2 = 7.2076.\n\nThe ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02809 /0.03673 = 0.7643. The log of that is log(0.7643)=?\n\nCalculating log(0.7643):\n\nLet me use a calculator approach here. Let me note that log(0.7643) = log(7.643 \u00d7 10^-1) = log(7.643) -1. \n\nlog(7.643) is between log(7.5)=0.8751 and log(8)=0.9031. \n\nUsing linear approximation between 7.5 and 8:\n\nAt x=7.5: log=0.8751\n\nAt x=8: log=0.9031\n\nThe difference between x=7.5 and 8 is 0.5 in x gives 0.028 in log. \n\n7.643 is 7.5 +0.143. So fraction is 0.143/0.5 = 0.286 of the interval.\n\nSo delta log = 0.286 *0.028 \u22480.008. \n\nThus log(7.643) \u22480.8751 +0.008=0.8831, so log(7.643\u00d71e-1) is 0.8831-1= -0.1169.\n\nThus pH = pKa2 + log(ratio) =7.2076 + (-0.1169)= 7.0907.\n\nThus pH is ~7.0907, so [H+] = 10^-7.0907.\n\nCalculating 10^-7.0907: 10^-7 is 1e-7, and 10^-0.0907. Let's compute 10^-0.0907:\n\nTake natural log: ln(10^0.0907)=0.0907 * ln(10)\u22480.0907*2.3026\u22480.209. So exp(-0.209)=?\n\nexp(-0.2)=0.8187; exp(-0.209)= approx 0.81 (since exp(-0.2)=0.8187; each 0.01 decrease in exponent reduces it by about 0.002). So 0.209 is 0.009 more than 0.2, so 0.8187 - (0.009 *0.023) (derivative approx). Not sure, but let me compute it as:\n\nexp(-0.209) \u2248 e^-0.2 * e^-0.009 \u22480.8187 * (1 -0.009) \u22480.8187 *0.991\u22480.810. \n\nThus, [H+] =1e-7 *0.81 \u22488.1e-8 M. So that's correct.\n\nThus, plugging into the formula:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.1e-8)\n\nCalculate numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02809 = (1.8*0.02809)=0.050562, so 0.050562e-12 =5.0562e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.1e-8: 5.0562e-14 /8.1e-8 = (5.0562/8.1)*1e-6 = ~0.6242 *1e-6 =6.242e-7 M.\n\nWhich matches option A: 6.24e-7.\n\nHmm, but wait the options have option B as 5.48e-7, which is close but lower.

The ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02809 /0.036725 \u2248 0.7646. Log(0.7646) is log(7.646e-1) = log(7.646) -1 = ~0.883 -1 = -0.117. So pH = 7.2076 -0.117 = 7.0906.\n\nSo [H+] = 10^-7.0906. Let's compute that precisely:\n\n10^0.0906 = 10^(0.09) is about 1.23, so 10^-7.0906 = 10^(-7 -0.0906) = 1e-7 / 10^0.0906 \u2248 1e-7 / 1.23 \u2248 8.13e-8 M.

Let me note that log(0.7643) = log(7.643 \u00d7 10^-1) = log(7.643) -1. \n\nlog(7.643) is between log(7.5)=0.8751 and log(8)=0.9031. \n\nUsing linear approximation between 7.5 and 8:\n\nAt x=7.5: log=0.8751\n\nAt x=8: log=0.9031\n\nThe difference between x=7.5 and 8 is 0.5 in x gives 0.028 in log. \n\n7.643 is 7.5 +0.143.

So 0.209 is 0.009 more than 0.2, so 0.8187 - (0.009 *0.023) (derivative approx). Not sure, but let me compute it as:\n\nexp(-0.209) \u2248 e^-0.2 * e^-0.009 \u22480.8187 * (1 -0.009) \u22480.8187 *0.991\u22480.810. \n\nThus, [H+] =1e-7 *0.81 \u22488.1e-8 M.

So pKa2 is around 7.21.\n\nThe ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02809 / 0.03674 \u2248 0.765. Taking log(0.765) is approximately -0.117. So pH \u2248 7.21 -0.117 \u2248 7.093. So the pH is about 7.09.\n\nTherefore, [H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^-7.09 \u2248 8.1x10^-8 M. Let me check that: 10^-7 is 1e-7, 10^-7.09 is 10^(-7 -0.09) = 1e-7 * 10^(-0.09). 10^-0.09 \u2248 0.812, so 8.12e-8 M. So [H+] \u22488.12e-8 M.\n\nNow, going back to the third dissociation. The Ka3 expression is:\n\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can solve for [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nKa3 is 1.8e-12,\n\n[HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M,\n\n[H+] is 8.12e-8 M.\n\nSo:\n\n(1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / 8.12e-8\n\nLet me compute numerator first: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 \u2248 1.8 * 0.02809 = ~0.05056e-12?",
