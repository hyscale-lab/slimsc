The problem mentions the transition is at wavelength 1448 \u00c5. So the energy difference between the two levels corresponds to that photon's energy. \n\nThe energy of a photon is E = hc/\u03bb.

If the energy level 2 has higher energy than level 1, then \u0394E is positive. So the exponent is negative. So as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp(-\u0394E/(kT)) decreases. Therefore, if the temperature is lower (as in the spotted case), the ratio N2/N1 would decrease. Which matches the problem's statement that the ratio decreases when there are spots.
