So that would be (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.\n\nLet me think about how the ratio changes with temperature. The exponent in the Boltzmann factor is (E1 - E2)/(k T). Since E1 and E2 are the energy levels, and if level 1 is higher than level 2, then E1 > E2. So E1 - E2 is positive. So when T decreases, the exponent becomes a larger negative number, meaning the exponential term gets smaller. So the ratio n1/n2 would decrease as T decreases.\n\nSo when the star has spots (Teff=5500), the ratio is lower than when it doesn't (6000 K). So the ratio when no spots is higher.",

So when T is higher, the ratio n1/n2 increases because the denominator (n2) decreases. Because n2 is proportional to exp( -\u0394E/(k T) ), so when T is higher, the exponent is less negative, making the denominator smaller. So for higher T, n1/n2 is larger.\n\nSo when the star has no spots, T_eff is 6000 K, so the ratio is higher. When it has spots, T_eff is lower (5500 K), so the ratio is lower. The question is, what's the factor by which the ratio changes? So without spots, n1/n2 is higher than when it has spots. So the factor is (n1/n2)_unspotted divided by (n1/n2)_spotted.",

So that would be (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.\n\nLet me think about how the ratio changes with temperature. The exponent in the Boltzmann factor is (E1 - E2)/(k T). Since E1 and E2 are the energy levels, and if level 1 is higher than level 2, then E1 > E2. So E1 - E2 is positive. So when T decreases, the exponent becomes a larger negative number, meaning the exponential term gets smaller. So the ratio n1/n2 would decrease as T decreases.\n\nSo when the star has spots (Teff=5500), the ratio is lower than when it doesn't (6000 K). So the ratio when no spots is higher.",

So when T is higher, the ratio n1/n2 increases because the denominator (n2) decreases. Because n2 is proportional to exp( -\u0394E/(k T) ), so when T is higher, the exponent is less negative, making the denominator smaller. So for higher T, n1/n2 is larger.\n\nSo when the star has no spots, T_eff is 6000 K, so the ratio is higher. When it has spots, T_eff is lower (5500 K), so the ratio is lower. The question is, what's the factor by which the ratio changes? So without spots, n1/n2 is higher than when it has spots. So the factor is (n1/n2)_unspotted divided by (n1/n2)_spotted.",

But in reality, the effective temperature is an average, so perhaps the photosphere has regions at 6000 K (60%) and regions at a lower temperature (say T_spot) accounting for 40% of the surface.\n\nSo the effective temperature is determined by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4\u03c0 R^2 \u03c3 Teff^4.\n\nWhen spots are present, the total luminosity is the sum of the normal photosphere and the spots.\n\nSo L_total = L_normal + L_spots.\n\nL_normal = 0.6 * 4\u03c0 R^2 \u03c3 (6000)^4.\n\nL_spots = 0.4 * 4\u03c0 R^2 \u03c3 (T_spot)^4.\n\nSo total L = 4\u03c0 R^2 \u03c3 [ 0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(T_spot)^4 ].\n\nThe effective temperature when spots are present is Teff_2 =5500 K.
