Since Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent, maybe it's absorbing water. So if the gas mixture had H2O, then that's absorbed here, increasing tube 1's mass by 3.6g. Then tube 2 (Ca(OH)2) didn't change, so whatever would react with limewater (like CO2) isn't present, meaning the gas mixture after tube 1 doesn't have CO2. So perhaps CO2 was already removed by tube 1? Or maybe the gas that would react with Ca(OH)2 wasn't in the original mixture. Hmm.\n\nTube 3 (red hot Cu) gains 0.80g. Since it forms CuO, that implies that oxygen was present in the gas mixture. The copper is initially in a red-hot state (maybe as Cu metal?), and the O comes from the gas.

At STP, 22.4 L is a mole, so 2.24 L is 0.1 moles. That's a key point.\n\nLet me also note the mass changes. The total initial mass is 7.20 g of the salts.

The total mass of the salts is converted into the products, so maybe we can track the masses through each step.\n\nFirst, tube 1 (Mg(ClO4)2) gains 3.60g. Since Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent, maybe it's absorbing water. So if the gas mixture had H2O, then that's absorbed here, increasing tube 1's mass by 3.6g. Then tube 2 (Ca(OH)2) didn't change, so whatever would react with limewater (like CO2) isn't present, meaning the gas mixture after tube 1 doesn't have CO2. So perhaps CO2 was already removed by tube 1? Or maybe the gas that would react with Ca(OH)2 wasn't in the original mixture. Hmm.\n\nTube 3 (red hot Cu) gains 0.80g. Since it forms CuO, that implies that oxygen was present in the gas mixture. The copper is initially in a red-hot state (maybe as Cu metal?), and the O comes from the gas.

The total mass is n*(M_A + M_B) =7.20g.\n\nNow, when they decompose, let\u2019s think of their possible products. Let me think of possible salts and their thermal decomposition.\n\nCommon salts that decompose when heated might produce gases like CO2, H2O, NH3, SO2, Cl2, etc. Since the gases pass through tubes that absorb water and possibly CO2, and then through a copper tube where reaction occurs.\n\nFirst, tube 1 (Mg(ClO4)2) absorbs water (H2O), so if any H2O is present in the gas mixture, it's absorbed here, leading to a mass gain of 3.60g. That suggests that the mass of H2O is 3.60g. Let me check: the mass of water absorbed would be 3.60g. So moles of H2O would be 3.60g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol. So 0.2 mol of H2O. Hmm.\n\nThen, tube 2 (Ca(OH)2 solution) didn't change, so no CO2 (since Ca(OH)2 reacts with CO2 to form CaCO3, which would increase the mass). Since tube 2's mass didn't change, that suggests that either there was no CO2 in the gas mixture, or it was already removed before reaching tube 2. Since the gases first go through tube 1, which only absorbs H2O, maybe there was CO2 but it isn't present, so no reaction. So the gas mixture after tube 1 doesn't have CO2. So the original gases must not have CO2, or it was already removed elsewhere. But since tube 2's mass didn't change, that implies no CO2 passed through it.\n\nThen, tube 3 is red-hot copper, and it gains mass. The problem states that CuO formed in tube 3, so the mass gain is from oxygen. Let me see. The mass gain in tube 3 is 0.80g. The reaction here is: Cu (s) + 1/2 O2 \u2192 CuO (s). So each mole of O2 would produce 1 mole of CuO, but the mass gain from oxygen would be 0.8g. Let me calculate.\n\nThe mass gained in tube 3 is the mass of oxygen added. Let's see. Suppose that the gas passing through tube 3 has oxygen, which reacts with Cu. Let\u2019s denote the moles of O2 as x. The mass of O2 is 32x g (since molar mass O2 is 32). Since the copper gains mass, the mass gained is exactly the mass of oxygen added. So 32x = 0.80g \u2192 x = 0.80/32 = 0.025 mol of O2.",
          "text2": "Wait, but how much oxygen was in the gas?\n\nLet me think step by step. Let me first note the possible gases that the salts could produce upon heating. Since the salts are decomposed, their decomposition products are gases. Since the mixture is equimolar, the moles of A and B are the same.\n\nThe final gas left after all the tubes is 2.24 liters at STP. Since 1 mole is 22.4 liters, that's 0.1 moles of gas C. So gas C must be something that didn't react in any of the tubes. Let me think about what each tube does.\n\nTube 1: Mg(ClO4)2. This is a desiccant, so it probably absorbs water. So the first tube's mass increase (3.60g) is the mass of H2O absorbed. So the initial gas mixture must have included water vapor. The 3.60g is the mass of H2O, so that's 3.60g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 moles of H2O.\n\nTube 2: Ca(OH)2 solution. Since the mass didn't change, that means no CO2 was present in the gas mixture. If there was CO2, it would form CaCO3, which increases the mass, but since it didn't, so no CO2.\n\nTube 3: red-hot copper. The mass increased by 0.80g, which is the mass of oxygen added to the copper. Since CuO is formed, the oxygen comes from the gas. The gas must have contained O2. Let me see: the mass gain is the mass of O in CuO. Let's say the copper in the tube reacted with O2 to form CuO, so the mass gain is the mass of O added. Let's calculate:\n\nSuppose the mass of O is 0.80g. Since CuO has a molar mass of 63.55 + 16 = 79.55 g/mol. The oxygen in CuO is 16/79.55 of the total mass.",

So the total moles of gas after all the reactions would be 0.1 mol.\n\nLet me list all the gases produced by the salts' decomposition. Since the salts are A and B, when heated, they decompose into gases. The gases pass through the tubes:\n\nFirst, through Mg(ClO4)2 (tube1), which absorbs water. So any H2O is removed here. The mass gain here is 3.60g, which is 0.2 moles of H2O (since 18g/mol). So the total H2O produced is 0.2 mol.\n\nThen, the remaining gases go through Ca(OH)2 (tube2) which would absorb CO2. Since the mass didn't change, there is no CO2 in the gases. So the original gases must not have CO2, or it was already removed. But since tube2 didn't change, no CO2 was present. So the gases don't have CO2. Therefore, any CO2 must have been absorbed in another step, but since it's passed through tube1 first, perhaps the CO2 is not present. Hmm.\n\nThen through tube3 (CuO forming). The gas that causes this is O2, which reacts with Cu to form CuO. The mass gained here is 0.80g, which is 0.80g of oxygen added (since the copper was already in the tube).",

That suggests that the mass of H2O is 3.60g. Let me check: the mass of water absorbed would be 3.60g. So moles of H2O would be 3.60g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol. So 0.2 mol of H2O.

So gas C must be something that didn't react in any of the tubes. Let me think about what each tube does.\n\nTube 1: Mg(ClO4)2. This is a desiccant, so it probably absorbs water. So the first tube's mass increase (3.60g) is the mass of H2O absorbed. So the initial gas mixture must have included water vapor. The 3.60g is the mass of H2O, so that's 3.60g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 moles of H2O.\n\nTube 2: Ca(OH)2 solution. Since the mass didn't change, that means no CO2 was present in the gas mixture. If there was CO2, it would form CaCO3, which increases the mass, but since it didn't, so no CO2.\n\nTube 3: red-hot copper. The mass increased by 0.80g, which is the mass of oxygen added to the copper. Since CuO is formed, the oxygen comes from the gas. The gas must have contained O2. Let me see: the mass gain is the mass of O in CuO. Let's say the copper in the tube reacted with O2 to form CuO, so the mass gain is the mass of O added. Let's calculate:\n\nSuppose the mass of O is 0.80g. Since CuO has a molar mass of 63.55 + 16 = 79.55 g/mol. The oxygen in CuO is 16/79.55 of the total mass.",

The mass gain here is 3.60g, which is the mass of the absorbed substance. Assuming it's water, then the amount of H2O is 3.60g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n2. Tube2 (Ca(OH)\u2082 solution): no change, so any CO2 in the gas mixture must have been already absorbed, but since tube2 didn't change, there must be no CO2. So the gas mixture doesn't have CO2.\n\n3. Tube3 (red-hot Cu): the gas here caused Cu to form CuO, so the gas must have been O2 (as per earlier reasoning), and the O2 reacts with Cu to form CuO. The amount of O2 is 0.025 mol as calculated earlier.\n\nThe remaining gas after all tubes is 2.24 L (0.1 mol). That gas must be a gas that didn't react in any of the tubes. So what's left must be a gas that's not absorbed by Mg(ClO4)\u2082 (so not water), doesn't react with Ca(OH)\u2082 (so not CO2), and doesn't react with red-hot Cu (so not O2 or a reducing agent like H2). \n\nPossible candidates for the remaining gas: maybe nitrogen (N2), which is inert; or maybe something like NO, but I'm not sure.",
