The energy difference \u0394E here would be the energy of that transition.\n\nNow, the paramagnetic coupling term (Zeeman effect) energy shift is given by the Zeeman term. The Zeeman energy is typically \u03bc_B * B * m, where \u03bc_B is the Bohr magneton, and m is the orbital magnetic quantum number.",

So 0.25 - 1/n\u00b2 \u2248 0.1875 \u2192 1/n\u00b2 \u2248 0.25 - 0.1875 = 0.0625 \u2192 n\u00b2 = 1/0.0625 = 16 \u2192 n=4. \n\nSo the transition is from n=4 to n=2. The energy difference would be between those levels. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n\u00b2. \n\nSo \u0394E for n=4 to n=2: E_2 - E_4 = (-13.6/4) - (-13.6/16) = (-3.4) - (-0.85) = -2.55 eV. The magnitude is 2.55 eV. So that's the transition energy \u0394E. \n\nNow the paramagnetic term, the Zeeman splitting. The energy shift from the magnetic field is \u0394E_Zeeman = \u03bc_B * B * m. \n\n\u03bc_B is the Bohr magneton, which is approximately 9.27e-24 J/T. \n\nGiven B = 1 T, so the energy shift is 9.27e-24 * 1 * m. The value of m here is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Since the question says \"small values of m\", probably m is on the order of 1 or maybe up to n, but for n=4, m can be up to 3. But since they say small, maybe m is like 1. Let's take m=1 as a typical value. \n\nSo \u0394E_Zeeman \u2248 9.27e-24 J. To convert that to eV, since 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, so 9.27e-24 / 1.6e-19 \u2248 5.8e-5 eV. \n\nSo the Zeeman energy is about 5.8e-5 eV, which is way smaller than the transition energy of 2.55 eV. So the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be C) \u27e8H\u27e9 \u226a \u0394E.",
