So A would have 3+2=5 carbons? Plus the nitrogens. \n\nStep 2: BuLi adds a lithium, but doesn't add carbons. \n\nStep 3: bromoethane adds an ethyl group (2 carbons) \u2192 so C would have 5 + 2 =7 carbons. \n\nStep 4: HgCl2/H2O/H+ \u2192 maybe loses a carbon or adds an OH? Not sure. \n\nStep 5: PPh3 with 3-bromopentane (C5H11Br) and BuLi. The PPh3 might be part of a Wittig reaction?",
