So perhaps the answer must include both 1 and 2, because Poincare is required, and Lorentz is a subset. Hmm, but actually, Poincare symmetry is a combination. So if a theory has Poincare symmetry, then it has Lorentz symmetry. But since the question lists them as separate options, maybe the answer requires both 1 and 2 to be included. However, the SMEFT operators must respect the symmetries of the Standard Model, which includes Poincare. So 1 and 2 are both required. \n\nCPT is a must because of the CPT theorem. But CP isn't. So the correct options would be 1,2,4. Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. Option D includes 1,3,4 which would be wrong because of CP. So the answer should be C. Let me confirm. The SMEFT operators must conserve Poincare and Lorentz?",
