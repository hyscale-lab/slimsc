The Standard Model is CPT symmetric because it's a Lorentz-invariant theory, and Lorentz symmetry enforces CPT invariance under certain conditions (like if the theory is Lorentz invariant and unitary). So if the SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must automatically respect CPT symmetry. So option 4, CPT, must be respected as well.\n\nBut what about CP symmetry? The Standard Model is not CP symmetric. For example, CP violation occurs in the CKM matrix. So SMEFT operators would include terms that can violate CP. Therefore, the operators don't have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not a must.\n\nSo putting it all together, which symmetries must all operators respect? Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So the correct options are 1,2,4. Let's look at the options.\n\nOption C is 1,2,4. So the answer should be option C.",

CPT is Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. I remember that in quantum field theory, CPT is a fundamental symmetry. It states that for any interaction, the combination of C, P, and T transformations must leave the physics invariant. So any operator in the theory must respect CPT. So all SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 must be correct.\n\nPutting this together, the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz (1), Poincar\u00e9 (2), and CPT (4).",
