So the K for the dissociation would be the reciprocal of the formation constant. Oh right! Because K for dissociation is Kd = 1/Kf. Since Kf is 5e10, Kd would be 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.\n\nSo I can model this as:\n\nKd = [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA^2\u2212]\n\nWe know that the initial concentration of CaEDTA^2\u2212 is 0.02 M. Since the dissociation is small, the change in [CaEDTA^2\u2212] will be negligible. So we can approximate [CaEDTA^2\u2212] \u2248 0.02 M.\n\nLet me set up the variables. Let x be the concentration of Ca^2+ produced from dissociation. So [Ca^2+] = x, and [EDTA^4-] = x as well because the stoichiometry is 1:1. So the Kd expression becomes:\n\nKd = (x)(x) / (0.02) = x\u00b2 / 0.02\n\nWe know Kd = 2e-11, so:\n\nx\u00b2 / 0.02 = 2e-11\n\nMultiply both sides by 0.02:\n\nx\u00b2 = 2e-11 * 0.02",

So, if K is given as 5e10, that's a very large number, meaning the complex is very stable.\n\nSo, the dissociation would have a very small K, which would be 1/K, right? Because the formation constant is K = [complex]/([Ca][EDTA]), so the dissociation K would be [Ca][EDTA]/[complex] = 1/K.\n\nSo, for the dissociation, K_dissociation = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.\n\nNow, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, initially, [CaEDTA] is 0.02 M. The other ions, Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-, both start at zero, but as the complex dissociates, some of them form.\n\nLet me denote the change as x. So, when the complex dissociates, it produces x amount of Ca^2+ and x amount of EDTA^4-.\n\nSo, at equilibrium, the concentrations would be:\n\n[CaEDTA] = 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02 (since K is so large, x is probably very small, so 0.02 -x \u22480.02)\n\n[Ca^2+] = x\n[EDTA^4-] = x\n\nSo, the dissociation constant K_d is equal to [Ca][EDTA]/[CaEDTA] = (x * x) / (0.02) = x\u00b2 / 0.02 = K_d.",
