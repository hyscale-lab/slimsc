          "text1": "Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me do this again.\n\nEach methyl group is -CH3. Adding one methyl group to benzene (C6H6) gives toluene: C7H8. The original benzene has 6 H. Adding the methyl (which is CH3, so 3 H) but replacing one H, so total H is 6-1 +3 = 8. So each methyl group adds 1 C and 2 H (since 3 H from methyl minus the one replaced H gives +2 H). So for four methyl groups:\n\nC: 6 +4 =10.\n\nH: 6 + (4 *2) =6 +8=14. So tetramethylbenzene would actually be C10H14! Oh! I see, I made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 18 H. That was wrong. So tetramethylbenzene is indeed C10H14. Okay, that makes sense now. So the tetramethylbenzene options are valid here. \n\nAlright, so now I can proceed. \n\nThe NMR spectrum has two signals at ~6.7 ppm (aromatic protons), in a 1:1 ratio. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, the two compounds must each contribute an aromatic signal that's a singlet, and their ratios would average to 1:1 between the two. So each compound must have certain hydrogen environments. \n\nAlso, the signals at 2.2 ppm are all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. Since the mixture is 1:1, the three singlets must come from the two compounds. Let me think. \n\nFirst, let's analyze each compound's NMR signals. Let me consider the options one by one, but maybe start with the possible candidates.\n\nThe compounds are either tetramethylbenzenes or diethylbenzene. Let's look at each compound's structure and predict their NMR spectra.\n\nFirst, let's consider 1,4-diethylbenzene (option C and D include this). Its structure is benzene with two ethyl groups in the 1,4 positions. Each ethyl group has two CH2 and one CH3.",
          "text2": "Wait, perhaps better to compute the formula. Each ethyl group is C2H5. So substituting two ethyl groups on benzene would replace two H's with C2H5 groups. \n\nOriginal benzene: C6H6. Each substitution: replacing one H with a C2H5 group. So each substitution adds (C2H5) which contributes 2C and 5 H, but loses one H. So per substitution: net C: +2, H: +5-1=+4. Two substitutions: so total C:6 +2*2=10, H:6 + 2*(4)= 6+8=14. So the formula is C10H14, which matches. So both the tetramethylbenzenes and the diethylbenzene have the correct molecular formula.\n\nNow the NMR data. The question states that the mixture has two compounds each in 1:1 ratio, so the NMR signals are from both compounds. The spectrum shows two signals at ~6.7 ppm (both singlets) in 1:1 ratio, and three signals at ~2.2 ppm (all singlets) in 2:1:1 ratio. \n\nFirst, the aromatic protons. Since the compounds are aromatic, the signals around 6.7 ppm must be from aromatic protons. The two singlets at 6.7 ppm in 1:1 ratio suggest that each compound contributes one set of aromatic protons. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, each compound's aromatic protons would show up as a singlet, and their integrals (the areas under the peaks) would be in a ratio of 1:1. So each compound has only one set of equivalent aromatic protons. \n\nLooking at the tetramethylbenzenes: let's consider their structures. \n\nStarting with 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: the methyl groups are on 1,2,3,4 positions. Let me think about the symmetry. In this arrangement, the molecule would have certain symmetry. Let me try to visualize. If the methyl groups are on 1,2,3,4 positions, then the molecule is actually a 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.",

So the tetramethylbenzenes are C10H14, and the diethylbenzene is also C10H14. \n\nSo the possible compounds are the four listed, all with the correct molecular formula. \n\nThe NMR data: the spectrum shows two signals at ~6.7 ppm (two singlets in 1:1 ratio) and three signals at ~2.2 ppm (three singlets in 2:1:1 ratio). \n\nFirst, I need to think about what these signals represent. The aromatic proton signals (around 6.7 ppm) are probably the remaining aromatic hydrogens that aren't quenched by the substituents. Since all the compounds are tetramethyl or diethyl derivatives, a tetramethylbenzene would have 6 -4 = 2 aromatic H's.",

The benzene ring itself has 6 C, but with four methyl groups attached. The original benzene structure would have 6 H. Each methyl group replaces a hydrogen. So total H would be 6 -4 (for the substituents) plus 4*(3) methyl H. So 6-4 =2, plus 12 gives 14. Oh right, so C10H14. Okay. So all the tetramethylbenzenes here have the correct formula. Diethylbenzene: 1,4-diethylbenzene. Each ethyl is -C2H5. So substituting two ethyl groups on benzene. Benzene has 6 C. Each ethyl adds 2 C, so total 6+2+2=10 C. Hydrogens: benzene has 6 H. Each ethyl group replaces one H and adds 5 H each. So total H: 6 -2 (for two substituents) plus 2*(5)=10. So 6-2=4 +10=14. So yes, that's C10H14.

          "text1": "Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me do this again.\n\nEach methyl group is -CH3. Adding one methyl group to benzene (C6H6) gives toluene: C7H8. The original benzene has 6 H. Adding the methyl (which is CH3, so 3 H) but replacing one H, so total H is 6-1 +3 = 8. So each methyl group adds 1 C and 2 H (since 3 H from methyl minus the one replaced H gives +2 H). So for four methyl groups:\n\nC: 6 +4 =10.\n\nH: 6 + (4 *2) =6 +8=14. So tetramethylbenzene would actually be C10H14! Oh! I see, I made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 18 H. That was wrong. So tetramethylbenzene is indeed C10H14. Okay, that makes sense now. So the tetramethylbenzene options are valid here. \n\nAlright, so now I can proceed. \n\nThe NMR spectrum has two signals at ~6.7 ppm (aromatic protons), in a 1:1 ratio. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, the two compounds must each contribute an aromatic signal that's a singlet, and their ratios would average to 1:1 between the two. So each compound must have certain hydrogen environments. \n\nAlso, the signals at 2.2 ppm are all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. Since the mixture is 1:1, the three singlets must come from the two compounds. Let me think. \n\nFirst, let's analyze each compound's NMR signals. Let me consider the options one by one, but maybe start with the possible candidates.\n\nThe compounds are either tetramethylbenzenes or diethylbenzene. Let's look at each compound's structure and predict their NMR spectra.\n\nFirst, let's consider 1,4-diethylbenzene (option C and D include this). Its structure is benzene with two ethyl groups in the 1,4 positions. Each ethyl group has two CH2 and one CH3.",
          "text2": "Wait, perhaps better to compute the formula. Each ethyl group is C2H5. So substituting two ethyl groups on benzene would replace two H's with C2H5 groups. \n\nOriginal benzene: C6H6. Each substitution: replacing one H with a C2H5 group. So each substitution adds (C2H5) which contributes 2C and 5 H, but loses one H. So per substitution: net C: +2, H: +5-1=+4. Two substitutions: so total C:6 +2*2=10, H:6 + 2*(4)= 6+8=14. So the formula is C10H14, which matches. So both the tetramethylbenzenes and the diethylbenzene have the correct molecular formula.\n\nNow the NMR data. The question states that the mixture has two compounds each in 1:1 ratio, so the NMR signals are from both compounds. The spectrum shows two signals at ~6.7 ppm (both singlets) in 1:1 ratio, and three signals at ~2.2 ppm (all singlets) in 2:1:1 ratio. \n\nFirst, the aromatic protons. Since the compounds are aromatic, the signals around 6.7 ppm must be from aromatic protons. The two singlets at 6.7 ppm in 1:1 ratio suggest that each compound contributes one set of aromatic protons. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, each compound's aromatic protons would show up as a singlet, and their integrals (the areas under the peaks) would be in a ratio of 1:1. So each compound has only one set of equivalent aromatic protons. \n\nLooking at the tetramethylbenzenes: let's consider their structures. \n\nStarting with 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: the methyl groups are on 1,2,3,4 positions. Let me think about the symmetry. In this arrangement, the molecule would have certain symmetry. Let me try to visualize.

So four methyl groups would give C6 +4 = 10 C, and H is 6 + (4*(3-1)) = 6 +8=14. So tetramethylbenzene is C10H14. Okay, that works.

          "text1": "Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me do this again.\n\nEach methyl group is -CH3. Adding one methyl group to benzene (C6H6) gives toluene: C7H8. The original benzene has 6 H. Adding the methyl (which is CH3, so 3 H) but replacing one H, so total H is 6-1 +3 = 8. So each methyl group adds 1 C and 2 H (since 3 H from methyl minus the one replaced H gives +2 H). So for four methyl groups:\n\nC: 6 +4 =10.\n\nH: 6 + (4 *2) =6 +8=14. So tetramethylbenzene would actually be C10H14! Oh! I see, I made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 18 H. That was wrong. So tetramethylbenzene is indeed C10H14. Okay, that makes sense now. So the tetramethylbenzene options are valid here. \n\nAlright, so now I can proceed. \n\nThe NMR spectrum has two signals at ~6.7 ppm (aromatic protons), in a 1:1 ratio. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, the two compounds must each contribute an aromatic signal that's a singlet, and their ratios would average to 1:1 between the two. So each compound must have certain hydrogen environments. \n\nAlso, the signals at 2.2 ppm are all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. Since the mixture is 1:1, the three singlets must come from the two compounds. Let me think. \n\nFirst, let's analyze each compound's NMR signals. Let me consider the options one by one, but maybe start with the possible candidates.\n\nThe compounds are either tetramethylbenzenes or diethylbenzene. Let's look at each compound's structure and predict their NMR spectra.\n\nFirst, let's consider 1,4-diethylbenzene (option C and D include this). Its structure is benzene with two ethyl groups in the 1,4 positions. Each ethyl group has two CH2 and one CH3.",
          "text2": "Wait, perhaps better to compute the formula. Each ethyl group is C2H5. So substituting two ethyl groups on benzene would replace two H's with C2H5 groups. \n\nOriginal benzene: C6H6. Each substitution: replacing one H with a C2H5 group. So each substitution adds (C2H5) which contributes 2C and 5 H, but loses one H. So per substitution: net C: +2, H: +5-1=+4. Two substitutions: so total C:6 +2*2=10, H:6 + 2*(4)= 6+8=14. So the formula is C10H14, which matches. So both the tetramethylbenzenes and the diethylbenzene have the correct molecular formula.\n\nNow the NMR data. The question states that the mixture has two compounds each in 1:1 ratio, so the NMR signals are from both compounds. The spectrum shows two signals at ~6.7 ppm (both singlets) in 1:1 ratio, and three signals at ~2.2 ppm (all singlets) in 2:1:1 ratio. \n\nFirst, the aromatic protons. Since the compounds are aromatic, the signals around 6.7 ppm must be from aromatic protons. The two singlets at 6.7 ppm in 1:1 ratio suggest that each compound contributes one set of aromatic protons. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, each compound's aromatic protons would show up as a singlet, and their integrals (the areas under the peaks) would be in a ratio of 1:1. So each compound has only one set of equivalent aromatic protons. \n\nLooking at the tetramethylbenzenes: let's consider their structures. \n\nStarting with 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: the methyl groups are on 1,2,3,4 positions. Let me think about the symmetry. In this arrangement, the molecule would have certain symmetry. Let me try to visualize.

          "text1": "Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me do this again.\n\nEach methyl group is -CH3. Adding one methyl group to benzene (C6H6) gives toluene: C7H8. The original benzene has 6 H. Adding the methyl (which is CH3, so 3 H) but replacing one H, so total H is 6-1 +3 = 8. So each methyl group adds 1 C and 2 H (since 3 H from methyl minus the one replaced H gives +2 H). So for four methyl groups:\n\nC: 6 +4 =10.\n\nH: 6 + (4 *2) =6 +8=14. So tetramethylbenzene would actually be C10H14! Oh! I see, I made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 18 H. That was wrong. So tetramethylbenzene is indeed C10H14. Okay, that makes sense now. So the tetramethylbenzene options are valid here. \n\nAlright, so now I can proceed. \n\nThe NMR spectrum has two signals at ~6.7 ppm (aromatic protons), in a 1:1 ratio. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, the two compounds must each contribute an aromatic signal that's a singlet, and their ratios would average to 1:1 between the two. So each compound must have certain hydrogen environments. \n\nAlso, the signals at 2.2 ppm are all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. Since the mixture is 1:1, the three singlets must come from the two compounds. Let me think. \n\nFirst, let's analyze each compound's NMR signals. Let me consider the options one by one, but maybe start with the possible candidates.\n\nThe compounds are either tetramethylbenzenes or diethylbenzene. Let's look at each compound's structure and predict their NMR spectra.\n\nFirst, let's consider 1,4-diethylbenzene (option C and D include this). Its structure is benzene with two ethyl groups in the 1,4 positions. Each ethyl group has two CH2 and one CH3.",
          "text2": "Wait, perhaps better to compute the formula. Each ethyl group is C2H5. So substituting two ethyl groups on benzene would replace two H's with C2H5 groups. \n\nOriginal benzene: C6H6. Each substitution: replacing one H with a C2H5 group. So each substitution adds (C2H5) which contributes 2C and 5 H, but loses one H. So per substitution: net C: +2, H: +5-1=+4. Two substitutions: so total C:6 +2*2=10, H:6 + 2*(4)= 6+8=14. So the formula is C10H14, which matches. So both the tetramethylbenzenes and the diethylbenzene have the correct molecular formula.\n\nNow the NMR data. The question states that the mixture has two compounds each in 1:1 ratio, so the NMR signals are from both compounds. The spectrum shows two signals at ~6.7 ppm (both singlets) in 1:1 ratio, and three signals at ~2.2 ppm (all singlets) in 2:1:1 ratio. \n\nFirst, the aromatic protons. Since the compounds are aromatic, the signals around 6.7 ppm must be from aromatic protons. The two singlets at 6.7 ppm in 1:1 ratio suggest that each compound contributes one set of aromatic protons. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, each compound's aromatic protons would show up as a singlet, and their integrals (the areas under the peaks) would be in a ratio of 1:1. So each compound has only one set of equivalent aromatic protons. \n\nLooking at the tetramethylbenzenes: let's consider their structures. \n\nStarting with 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: the methyl groups are on 1,2,3,4 positions. Let me think about the symmetry. In this arrangement, the molecule would have certain symmetry. Let me try to visualize.

          "text1": "Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me do this again.\n\nEach methyl group is -CH3. Adding one methyl group to benzene (C6H6) gives toluene: C7H8. The original benzene has 6 H. Adding the methyl (which is CH3, so 3 H) but replacing one H, so total H is 6-1 +3 = 8. So each methyl group adds 1 C and 2 H (since 3 H from methyl minus the one replaced H gives +2 H). So for four methyl groups:\n\nC: 6 +4 =10.\n\nH: 6 + (4 *2) =6 +8=14. So tetramethylbenzene would actually be C10H14! Oh! I see, I made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 18 H. That was wrong. So tetramethylbenzene is indeed C10H14. Okay, that makes sense now. So the tetramethylbenzene options are valid here. \n\nAlright, so now I can proceed. \n\nThe NMR spectrum has two signals at ~6.7 ppm (aromatic protons), in a 1:1 ratio. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, the two compounds must each contribute an aromatic signal that's a singlet, and their ratios would average to 1:1 between the two. So each compound must have certain hydrogen environments. \n\nAlso, the signals at 2.2 ppm are all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. Since the mixture is 1:1, the three singlets must come from the two compounds. Let me think. \n\nFirst, let's analyze each compound's NMR signals. Let me consider the options one by one, but maybe start with the possible candidates.\n\nThe compounds are either tetramethylbenzenes or diethylbenzene. Let's look at each compound's structure and predict their NMR spectra.\n\nFirst, let's consider 1,4-diethylbenzene (option C and D include this). Its structure is benzene with two ethyl groups in the 1,4 positions. Each ethyl group has two CH2 and one CH3.",
          "text2": "Wait, perhaps better to compute the formula. Each ethyl group is C2H5. So substituting two ethyl groups on benzene would replace two H's with C2H5 groups. \n\nOriginal benzene: C6H6. Each substitution: replacing one H with a C2H5 group. So each substitution adds (C2H5) which contributes 2C and 5 H, but loses one H. So per substitution: net C: +2, H: +5-1=+4. Two substitutions: so total C:6 +2*2=10, H:6 + 2*(4)= 6+8=14. So the formula is C10H14, which matches. So both the tetramethylbenzenes and the diethylbenzene have the correct molecular formula.\n\nNow the NMR data. The question states that the mixture has two compounds each in 1:1 ratio, so the NMR signals are from both compounds. The spectrum shows two signals at ~6.7 ppm (both singlets) in 1:1 ratio, and three signals at ~2.2 ppm (all singlets) in 2:1:1 ratio. \n\nFirst, the aromatic protons. Since the compounds are aromatic, the signals around 6.7 ppm must be from aromatic protons. The two singlets at 6.7 ppm in 1:1 ratio suggest that each compound contributes one set of aromatic protons. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, each compound's aromatic protons would show up as a singlet, and their integrals (the areas under the peaks) would be in a ratio of 1:1. So each compound has only one set of equivalent aromatic protons. \n\nLooking at the tetramethylbenzenes: let's consider their structures. \n\nStarting with 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: the methyl groups are on 1,2,3,4 positions. Let me think about the symmetry. In this arrangement, the molecule would have certain symmetry. Let me try to visualize.
