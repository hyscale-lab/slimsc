Maybe I should recall the exact expression. \n\nActually, the standard formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 a (1 - A)) ), where R_star is the radius of the star, but perhaps more accurately, considering the star's luminosity L = 4\u03c0R_star\u00b2\u03c3T_star^4, so substituting:\n\nT_eq = ( (L(1 - A)/(16 \u03c0 \u03c3 a\u00b2) ) )^(1/4 )\n\nBut regardless, since L and \u03c3 are constants for the star, and A is the same for all planets, the equilibrium temperature T is proportional to (1/a)^(1/2).

So the ratio T1/T2 =1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, the ratio T2/T3 is 2.3. So T2 is higher than T3, so Planet3 is farther out than Planet2. \n\nSo for Planet2 and Planet3: T2/T3 = sqrt(D3/D2). Therefore D3/D2 = (T2/T3)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29. \n\nSo, if we can get the distances in terms of D1, then we can relate them. \n\nSo let me denote D1 as the orbital distance of Planet1. Then D2 = D1*(T1/T2)^2 = D1*(1.4)^2 = D1*1.96. \n\nThen D3 is D2*(D3/D2) = D2*(5.29) = D1*1.96 *5.29. Let me compute that: 1.96 *5.29. Let's see, 2 *5.29 is 10.58, minus 0.04*5.29 (since 1.96 is 2-0.04). So 0.04*5.29 is 0.2116. So 10.58 -0.2116 = 10.3684. So D3 is approximately 10.37 times D1. \n\nNow, we need to find the orbital period ratio between Planet3 and Planet1. \n\nKepler's third law states that (P^2)/(a^3) = constant for planets around the same star.

So that would mean Planet3 is farther out.\n\nSo using the same formula as before, for Planet2 and 3:\n\nT2 / T3 = (a3/a2)^{1/2} \u2192 2.3 = (a3/a2)^{1/2} \u2192 a3/a2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29.\n\nSo a3 is 5.29 times a2.\n\nNow, since a2 is 1.96 a1, then a3 is 5.29 * 1.96 a1 \u2248 let's calculate that.\n\n1.96 * 5.29: 2*5.29 is 10.58 minus 0.04*5.29 (since 1.96 is 2-0.04). 0.04*5.29 is 0.2116. So 10.58 - 0.2116 \u2248 10.368. So a3 \u2248 10.37 a1. So the orbital distances are in ratios a1 : a2 \u22481.96 a1 : a3 \u2248 10.37 a1.\n\nNow, orbital period depends on the orbital radius via Kepler's third law.

If it's the same as the previous, where Planet1 vs Planet2 was T1/T2 =1.4, then here T2/T3 =2.3.

The mass of the planets themselves don't affect their orbital periods in this approximation. Therefore, the mass ratios given here might be a red herring, unless the question is considering some other effect. Since the problem is asking about orbital period, which is determined by the distance from the star (a), not the planet's mass. So the mass ratios might not be needed here. That's interesting. The problem gives mass ratios, but perhaps they are irrelevant for this particular calculation. The question is only about orbital periods based on equilibrium temperatures, which relate to distance. So the mass ratios might be there to confuse or for another part not needed here. So I can proceed with the calculation as before.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D) 33.4.

So that's T2/T3 = 2.3 or T3/T2? Need to clarify. \n\nThe question says \"the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet2 and Planet3\". If it's the same as the previous, where Planet1 vs Planet2 was T1/T2 =1.4, then here T2/T3 =2.3. Therefore, T2 is higher than T3, so Planet3 is farther away. \n\nThus, the ratio of a3/a2 would be (T2/T3)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29. \n\nTherefore, the orbital distances are as follows: \n\nLet me denote a1, a2, a3 as the semi-major axes. \n\nWe have a2/a1 = (T1/T2)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \n\na3/a2 = (T2/T3)^2 = (2.3)^2 \u2248 5.29 \n\nThus, a3/a1 = a3/a2 * a2/a1 = 5.29 * 1.96 \u2248 ?\n\nCalculating 5.29 *1.96: Let's compute 5 *1.96 =9.8, 0.29*1.96\u22480.5684 \u2192 total \u224810.3684. So approximately 10.37. \n\nBut we need the ratio of the orbital periods. Kepler's third law: (P1/P3)^2 = (a1^3)/(a3^3) \u2192 (P3/P1)^2 = (a3/a1)^3 \u2192 P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2).",

So the ratio T1/T2 =1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, the ratio T2/T3 is 2.3. So T2 is higher than T3, so Planet3 is farther out than Planet2. \n\nSo for Planet2 and Planet3: T2/T3 = sqrt(D3/D2). Therefore D3/D2 = (T2/T3)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29. \n\nSo, if we can get the distances in terms of D1, then we can relate them. \n\nSo let me denote D1 as the orbital distance of Planet1. Then D2 = D1*(T1/T2)^2 = D1*(1.4)^2 = D1*1.96. \n\nThen D3 is D2*(D3/D2) = D2*(5.29) = D1*1.96 *5.29. Let me compute that: 1.96 *5.29. Let's see, 2 *5.29 is 10.58, minus 0.04*5.29 (since 1.96 is 2-0.04). So 0.04*5.29 is 0.2116. So 10.58 -0.2116 = 10.3684. So D3 is approximately 10.37 times D1. \n\nNow, we need to find the orbital period ratio between Planet3 and Planet1. \n\nKepler's third law states that (P^2)/(a^3) = constant for planets around the same star. Since all three planets are around the same star, the ratio of their periods squared is equal to the ratio of their semi-major axes cubed. \n\nSo, (P3/P1)^2 = (D3/D1)^3 \u2192 (P3/P1) = (D3/D1)^(3/2). \n\nWe found that D3/D1 is approximately 10.37. Let me compute 10.37^(3/2). \n\nFirst, 10.37 squared is (approx) 10.37^2 = let's calculate: 10^2 is 100, 0.37^2 is ~0.1369, and cross term 2*10*0.37 =7.4. So total is 100 +7.4 +0.1369 = 107.5369. But actually, 10.37*10.37: 10*10=100, 10*0.37=3.7, 0.37*10=3.7, and 0.37^2. So (10 +0.37)^2 = 100 + 2*10*0.37 +0.37\u00b2 =100 +7.4 +0.1369=107.5369. \n\nThen the cube of 10.37 is 10.37 * 107.5369.

Let me read the question again carefully. \n\n\"Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?\"\n\nAh, the mass ratios might be a distractor. The problem didn't ask about mass, but orbital period. Since Kepler's third law for period only depends on the semi-major axis (assuming the star's mass is constant), the mass ratios don't affect the orbital period ratio. So they are probably there to test if the student gets confused and tries to use them. \n\nTherefore, my calculation leading to D seems correct.",

Therefore D3/D2 = (T2/T3)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29. \n\nSo, if we can get the distances in terms of D1, then we can relate them. \n\nSo let me denote D1 as the orbital distance of Planet1.

But actually, 10.37*10.37: 10*10=100, 10*0.37=3.7, 0.37*10=3.7, and 0.37^2. So (10 +0.37)^2 = 100 + 2*10*0.37 +0.37\u00b2 =100 +7.4 +0.1369=107.5369. \n\nThen the cube of 10.37 is 10.37 * 107.5369.

So approximately 10.37. \n\nBut we need the ratio of the orbital periods. Kepler's third law: (P1/P3)^2 = (a1^3)/(a3^3) \u2192 (P3/P1)^2 = (a3/a1)^3 \u2192 P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2).",
          "text2": "Wait, the question says \"the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4\". So the ratio T1/T2 =1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, the ratio T2/T3 is 2.3. So T2 is higher than T3, so Planet3 is farther out than Planet2. \n\nSo for Planet2 and Planet3: T2/T3 = sqrt(D3/D2). Therefore D3/D2 = (T2/T3)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29. \n\nSo, if we can get the distances in terms of D1, then we can relate them. \n\nSo let me denote D1 as the orbital distance of Planet1. Then D2 = D1*(T1/T2)^2 = D1*(1.4)^2 = D1*1.96. \n\nThen D3 is D2*(D3/D2) = D2*(5.29) = D1*1.96 *5.29. Let me compute that: 1.96 *5.29. Let's see, 2 *5.29 is 10.58, minus 0.04*5.29 (since 1.96 is 2-0.04). So 0.04*5.29 is 0.2116. So 10.58 -0.2116 = 10.3684. So D3 is approximately 10.37 times D1. \n\nNow, we need to find the orbital period ratio between Planet3 and Planet1. \n\nKepler's third law states that (P^2)/(a^3) = constant for planets around the same star. Since all three planets are around the same star, the ratio of their periods squared is equal to the ratio of their semi-major axes cubed. \n\nSo, (P3/P1)^2 = (D3/D1)^3 \u2192 (P3/P1) = (D3/D1)^(3/2). \n\nWe found that D3/D1 is approximately 10.37. Let me compute 10.37^(3/2). \n\nFirst, 10.37 squared is (approx) 10.37^2 = let's calculate: 10^2 is 100, 0.37^2 is ~0.1369, and cross term 2*10*0.37 =7.4. So total is 100 +7.4 +0.1369 = 107.5369. But actually, 10.37*10.37: 10*10=100, 10*0.37=3.7, 0.37*10=3.7, and 0.37^2. So (10 +0.37)^2 = 100 + 2*10*0.37 +0.37\u00b2 =100 +7.4 +0.1369=107.5369. \n\nThen the cube of 10.37 is 10.37 * 107.5369.
