Let me compute 163,000 / 0.99999987. \n\n0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. So 1/(1 - x) \u2248 1 + x for small x. So 1/(0.99999987) \u2248 1 + 1.3e-7.

The proper time \u03c4 for a trip at speed v between two points separated by distance D in the Earth frame is given by:\n\n\u03c4 = (D / v) * sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)\n\nSo plugging in D = 163,000 ly, v = 0.99999987c. So:\n\nFirst, D / v is (163,000 ly) / (0.99999987c). Since D is in light-years and v is in terms of c, then D/(v) is (163000)/0.99999987 years. Let's approximate that as 163,000 years (since 0.99999987 is nearly 1, so dividing by it gives a value just a tiny bit more than 163,000). Let me compute 163,000 / 0.99999987. \n\n0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. So 1/(1 - x) \u2248 1 + x for small x. So 1/(0.99999987) \u2248 1 + 1.3e-7. Thus, D/v \u2248 163000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) \u2248 163000 + 163000*1.3e-7. The second term is 163000 * 1.3e-7 \u2248 (163 * 1e3) * 1.3e-7 = 163 * 1.3e-4 \u2248 0.02119. So approximately 163,000.021 years.

Since \u0394x is the distance in the Earth's frame, which is D = 163,000 light-years, and \u0394t would be D / v. \n\nLet me write that out step by step. \n\nFirst, compute the time in Earth's frame, T = D / v.

Let me try to compute gamma again with v =0.99999987c.\n\nLet's compute beta =0.99999987, so beta squared is:\n\nLet me compute (0.99999987)^2:\n\nLet me write this as (1 - 0.00000013)^2.\n\nExpanding, 1 - 2*(0.00000013) + (0.00000013)^2. The first two terms give 1 - 0.00000026. The third term is (0.00000013)^2=1.69e-14. So negligible. So 1 - beta\u00b2 is exactly 0.00000026. So sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2)=sqrt(0.00000026)= approx 0.0005099.\n\nThus, gamma is 1/0.0005099\u2248 1961. \n\nHmm. So the calculation is correct, leading to ~83 years.

So:\n\nFirst, D / v is (163,000 ly) / (0.99999987c). Since D is in light-years and v is in terms of c, then D/(v) is (163000)/0.99999987 years. Let's approximate that as 163,000 years (since 0.99999987 is nearly 1, so dividing by it gives a value just a tiny bit more than 163,000). Let me compute 163,000 / 0.99999987. \n\n0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. So 1/(1 - x) \u2248 1 + x for small x. So 1/(0.99999987) \u2248 1 + 1.3e-7. Thus, D/v \u2248 163000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) \u2248 163000 + 163000*1.3e-7. The second term is 163000 * 1.3e-7 \u2248 (163 * 1e3) * 1.3e-7 = 163 * 1.3e-4 \u2248 0.02119. So approximately 163,000.021 years.

Since \u0394x is the distance in the Earth's frame, which is D = 163,000 light-years, and \u0394t would be D / v. \n\nLet me write that out step by step. \n\nFirst, compute the time in Earth's frame, T = D / v.

So:\n\nFirst, D / v is (163,000 ly) / (0.99999987c). Since D is in light-years and v is in terms of c, then D/(v) is (163000)/0.99999987 years. Let's approximate that as 163,000 years (since 0.99999987 is nearly 1, so dividing by it gives a value just a tiny bit more than 163,000). Let me compute 163,000 / 0.99999987. \n\n0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. So 1/(1 - x) \u2248 1 + x for small x. So 1/(0.99999987) \u2248 1 + 1.3e-7. Thus, D/v \u2248 163000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) \u2248 163000 + 163000*1.3e-7. The second term is 163000 * 1.3e-7 \u2248 (163 * 1e3) * 1.3e-7 = 163 * 1.3e-4 \u2248 0.02119. So approximately 163,000.021 years. So the D/v term is roughly 163,000 years. \n\nNow multiply that by sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) which is sqrt(2.6e-7) \u2248 0.00051 as before. So \u03c4 \u2248 163,000 * 0.00051.

Since \u0394x is the distance in the Earth's frame, which is D = 163,000 light-years, and \u0394t would be D / v. \n\nLet me write that out step by step. \n\nFirst, compute the time in Earth's frame, T = D / v.

Here v = 0.99999987c, so 1 - v/c = 1.3e-7. So \u03b5 = 1.3e-7. The exact gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Let me compute 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = (1 - v/c)(1 + v/c). Since v is close to c, v/c \u2248 1, so (1 + v/c) \u2248 2. So 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 \u2248 2*(1 - v/c) = 2\u03b5. So sqrt(1-v\u00b2/c\u00b2) \u2248 sqrt(2\u03b5).
