The question is about the probability of measuring 0. So we need to find the component of the state vector in the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then the probability is the norm squared of that component.\n\nTherefore, next step is: find the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then project the system's state onto them, sum the squares.\n\nFirst, let's find the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0.\n\nWe need to solve (P - 0I)v = 0 \u2192 Pv = 0.\n\nSo the equation is Pv =0.\n\nThe matrix P is as given. So writing the equations:\n\nFirst row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 + 0*v3 =0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)v2 =0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nSecond row: (1/\u221a2)v1 +0*v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 =0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)(v1 + v3)=0 \u2192 v1 +v3=0.\n\nThird row:0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 +0*v3 =0 \u2192 same as first equation, so redundant since v2 is already 0.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 must satisfy:\n\nv2=0, and v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the general solution is vectors of the form (v1, 0, -v1), where v1 is any scalar.\n\nSo the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector (1, 0, -1).

Oh nice, so 0 is one of them. So the possible eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1. \n\nNow the problem asks for the probability of measuring 0, so we need the projection of the state vector onto the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Since the eigenvalues are distinct (assuming the eigenvectors are orthogonal), each eigenvector is part of an orthonormal basis.\n\nTherefore, to find the probability, we need to find the eigenvector(s) associated with eigenvalue 0, then compute the inner product of the state vector with each of those eigenvectors, square their absolute values, and sum them. Since eigenvalues are distinct, each eigenvector is unique (up to scaling), so the eigenspace for 0 is one-dimensional.\n\nSo first, let's find the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0. \n\nWe need to solve (P - 0I) v = 0 \u2192 P v = 0.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nFirst row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 =0.\n\nSecond row: (1/\u221a2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 =0 \u2192 (v1 + v3)/\u221a2 =0 \u2192 v1 + v3 =0 \u2192 v3 = -v1.\n\nThird row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 +0*v3 =0 \u2192 same as first row, so v2=0.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for 0 must satisfy v2=0 and v3 = -v1. So the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, -v1). \n\nWe can choose a basis vector here. Let's pick v1 =1, then v3 = -1. So the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1). But we need to normalize it. The norm squared is 1\u00b2 +0 + (-1)^2 = 2, so norm is sqrt(2). Thus the normalized eigenvector is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2).",

Oh nice, so 0 is one of them. So the possible eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1. \n\nNow the problem asks for the probability of measuring 0, so we need the projection of the state vector onto the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Since the eigenvalues are distinct (assuming the eigenvectors are orthogonal), each eigenvector is part of an orthonormal basis.\n\nTherefore, to find the probability, we need to find the eigenvector(s) associated with eigenvalue 0, then compute the inner product of the state vector with each of those eigenvectors, square their absolute values, and sum them. Since eigenvalues are distinct, each eigenvector is unique (up to scaling), so the eigenspace for 0 is one-dimensional.\n\nSo first, let's find the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0. \n\nWe need to solve (P - 0I) v = 0 \u2192 P v = 0.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nFirst row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 =0.\n\nSecond row: (1/\u221a2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 =0 \u2192 (v1 + v3)/\u221a2 =0 \u2192 v1 + v3 =0 \u2192 v3 = -v1.\n\nThird row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 +0*v3 =0 \u2192 same as first row, so v2=0.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for 0 must satisfy v2=0 and v3 = -v1. So the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, -v1). \n\nWe can choose a basis vector here. Let's pick v1 =1, then v3 = -1. So the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1). But we need to normalize it. The norm squared is 1\u00b2 +0 + (-1)^2 = 2, so norm is sqrt(2). Thus the normalized eigenvector is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2).",

Since eigenvalues are distinct, each eigenvector is unique (up to scaling), so the eigenspace for 0 is one-dimensional.\n\nSo first, let's find the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0. \n\nWe need to solve (P - 0I) v = 0 \u2192 P v = 0.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nFirst row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 =0.\n\nSecond row: (1/\u221a2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 =0 \u2192 (v1 + v3)/\u221a2 =0 \u2192 v1 + v3 =0 \u2192 v3 = -v1.\n\nThird row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 +0*v3 =0 \u2192 same as first row, so v2=0.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for 0 must satisfy v2=0 and v3 = -v1. So the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, -v1). \n\nWe can choose a basis vector here. Let's pick v1 =1, then v3 = -1. So the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1). But we need to normalize it. The norm squared is 1\u00b2 +0 + (-1)^2 = 2, so norm is sqrt(2). Thus the normalized eigenvector is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2).",

So the state vector isn't normalized. \n\nAh! That's probably it. The problem didn't mention the state is normalized. So in calculating probabilities, we need to normalize the state vector first. \n\nRight, because in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized. So the probability is the squared inner product divided by the norm squared. \n\nSo let me recast that. \n\nThe inner product of the state vector with the eigenvector is -sqrt(2), as above. The squared magnitude is 2. But the state vector's norm squared is 6, so the probability is (2)/6 = 1/3. \n\nOh! That makes sense. Because the state isn't normalized, so we have to divide by the square of the norm of the state vector. \n\nSo the correct probability is (|\u27e8v|\u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2)/(\u27e8\u03c8|\u03c8\u27e9).",

The question is about the probability of measuring 0. So we need to find the component of the state vector in the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then the probability is the norm squared of that component.\n\nTherefore, next step is: find the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then project the system's state onto them, sum the squares.\n\nFirst, let's find the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0.\n\nWe need to solve (P - 0I)v = 0 \u2192 Pv = 0.\n\nSo the equation is Pv =0.\n\nThe matrix P is as given.

Oh nice, so 0 is one of them. So the possible eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1. \n\nNow the problem asks for the probability of measuring 0, so we need the projection of the state vector onto the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Since the eigenvalues are distinct (assuming the eigenvectors are orthogonal), each eigenvector is part of an orthonormal basis.\n\nTherefore, to find the probability, we need to find the eigenvector(s) associated with eigenvalue 0, then compute the inner product of the state vector with each of those eigenvectors, square their absolute values, and sum them. Since eigenvalues are distinct, each eigenvector is unique (up to scaling), so the eigenspace for 0 is one-dimensional.\n\nSo first, let's find the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0. \n\nWe need to solve (P - 0I) v = 0 \u2192 P v = 0.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nFirst row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 =0.\n\nSecond row: (1/\u221a2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 =0 \u2192 (v1 + v3)/\u221a2 =0 \u2192 v1 + v3 =0 \u2192 v3 = -v1.\n\nThird row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 +0*v3 =0 \u2192 same as first row, so v2=0.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for 0 must satisfy v2=0 and v3 = -v1. So the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, -v1). \n\nWe can choose a basis vector here. Let's pick v1 =1, then v3 = -1. So the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1). But we need to normalize it. The norm squared is 1\u00b2 +0 + (-1)^2 = 2, so norm is sqrt(2). Thus the normalized eigenvector is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2).",
