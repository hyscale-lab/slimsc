Let me think of what LiAlH4 does. It's a reducing agent, used to reduce carbonyl groups. But reacting with water would produce H2 (or D2 if deuterated). The reaction with water would be: LiAlH4 + 4 H2O \u2192 LiOH + Al(OH)3 + 4 H2\u2191. The Al(OH)3 would precipitate (since it's only slightly soluble), so that could be the precipitate G. When heated, Al(OH)3 decomposes into Al2O3 and H2O. So B would be Al2O3. The melting point of Al2O3 (alumina) is about 2072\u00b0C, which is way too high. Doesn't fit the 277 K. \n\nHmm.

So for example, if X is made of Li, Al, and H (as in LiAlH4), but the H is deuterium (D), then the H would have an atomic mass of 2. So the lightest element (H) has mass 2 (if all H are D), and the heaviest (Al, mass 27). So total would be 2+27=29. Which is option D. \n\nAh! That makes sense. Because the question says \"incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\". So one of the elements in X must be present as a heavier isotope. For example, in LiAlH4, if the hydrogen is deuterium (D, mass 2 instead of 1), then the lightest element is still H (but with mass 2 due to the isotope), and the heaviest is Al (27). So the sum is 2 + 27 = 29, which is option D.",

So the lightest element is H (atomic mass 1, but in X it's D, which is isotope 2), but the question says \"atomic mass\" which usually is the average, but here since it's a specific isotope, maybe the mass of the isotope. The problem states \"incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\", so the element in question has a heavier isotope. So for example, if the H in LiAlH4 is replaced with D (so the H element here is D, mass 2), but the element is still hydrogen. So the lightest element is H (with mass 2 here?), but the question says \"the lightest element present\" \u2013 so the lightest element is hydrogen, but its isotope contributes a higher mass. So for the element H in X, the atoms are all D (mass 2 each), so total for H is 4*2=8. The heaviest element is Al (27), so total 8 +27=35. Which is option A.",
