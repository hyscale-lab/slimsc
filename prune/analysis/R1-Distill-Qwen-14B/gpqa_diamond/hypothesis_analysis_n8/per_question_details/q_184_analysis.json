Let me recall:\n\n- Nitro group (NO2) is deactivating and meta-directing.\n- Alkoxy groups (like ethoxy) are activating and ortho/para directing.\n- Alkyl groups like tert-butyl (which is a tertiary alkyl) are activating and ortho/para directing.\n\nThe synthesis steps usually involve adding substituents in a way that each subsequent group is placed in the correct position relative to the previous ones. \n\nStarting with benzene (no substituents), the first substitution will determine the first position.

Let me try to figure out the order of adding these groups. \n\nThe key is that when adding functional groups, each new group's position is determined by the existing substituents. Since nitro is meta directing, to get it at position 3, perhaps the existing groups must be at positions 1 and 2 such that adding nitro at 3 is allowed. Let me think step by step.\n\nSuppose the first step is adding the tert-butyl group. Since tert-butyl is an alkyl group, it can be added via Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The reagent for that is tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 catalyst. That would attach the tert-butyl group to benzene. But where? Since it's an activating group, the next groups added would be directed by it. But we need the tert-butyl at position 2. Hmm, but the initial benzene doesn't have any substituents yet.",

So if the first group is tert-butyl at 2, sulfonation would add at positions 4 or 6 (ortho to 2?), but wait, sulfonation is ortho/para to activating groups. Since tert-butyl is activating, sulfonation would be placed ortho or para to it. Let's say position 4. Then, when nitrating (step iii), the sulfonic acid is a strong deactivating group, so the nitro would go somewhere else. Let's say the nitro goes to position 3 (meta to tert-butyl?), but not sure. \n\nThen step iv is Fe/HCl (maybe alkylation?), but after sulfonation and nitration, the ring is very deactivated. Not sure.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think of the correct sequence logically.\n\nThe target molecule has three groups: tert-butyl (2), nitro (3), and ethoxy (1). Let's see the order of adding these groups so their positions are correct. \n\nTo get the ethoxy at position 1, which is adjacent to the tert-butyl (position 2), and opposite the nitro (position 3). \n\nThe nitro group is meta to the ethoxy group. \n\nSo the steps must be such that when adding the ethoxy, it's placed in a position that's ortho to the existing tert-butyl, but also meta to the nitro. But the order of adding the substituents is key.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n1. First, add the tert-butyl group. Let's say it's placed at position 2 (since that's where it needs to be). \n\n2. Then add the nitro group. Since the tert-butyl is activating, the nitro would be directed to the meta position (either 4 or 6). But in the target, the nitro is at 3, which is ortho to the tert-butyl. That's a problem. So maybe the nitro can't be added directly after the tert-butyl.",

Not helpful.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me think of the steps in option D:\n\nOption D's steps:\n\ni) HNO3/H2SO4 \u2192 nitrate benzene first.\n\nThen ii) Fe/HCl (F-C alkylation?) \u2192 but after nitration, the ring is deactivated. F-C alkylation might not work well. So maybe adding tert-butyl here would be difficult. So D might not be correct.\n\nLooking at option A again:\n\nOption A's steps:\n\ni) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 \u2192 add tert-butyl group (position let's say 2).\n\nii) HNO3/H2SO4 \u2192 nitrate. The nitro group would go into a meta position relative to tert-butyl. Since tert-butyl is ortho/para, the nitro (meta directing) would have to go into a position that's meta to the tert-butyl. If the tert-butyl is at 2, nitro could go to 4 or 6. But desired is 3. So that's a problem. Therefore, nitration after tert-butyl may not place nitro at 3. Hence, perhaps the nitration needs to be placed before adding another group?",

Let me look at the options again.\n\nLooking at option D: starts with nitration (HNO3/H2SO4), then Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?), then tert-butyl chloride. Hmm, that might not be good because nitration first would make nitro, which is deactivating and meta-directing.
