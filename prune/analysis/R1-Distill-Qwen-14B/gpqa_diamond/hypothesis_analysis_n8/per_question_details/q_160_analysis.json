The first zero of J1 is at x \u2248 3.8317. So setting that equal: (2pi/lambda)*(a*sin(theta))/2 = 3.8317 \u2192 (pi a sin(theta)) = 3.8317 \u2192 sin(theta) = 3.8317/(pi a). So the angle theta is approximately 3.8317/(pi a), but since the problem says to use the small angle approximation where tan(theta) \u2248 theta, so sin(theta) \u2248 theta.
