But since Z is part of Y, then the other component must hydrogenate to Z as well. \n\nAlso, the mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let me calculate that. Let's denote the molecular formula of Z as CnHm. The mass fraction of H is (m/(12n + m)) *100 =14.28. Let me compute that. Let me rearrange the equation:\n\n(m)/(12n + m) = 0.1428\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\nm = 0.1428*(12n + m)\n\nm = 0.1428*12n + 0.1428m\n\nm -0.1428m = 0.1428*12n \n\n0.8572m = 1.7136n \n\nDivide both sides by n:\n\n0.8572*(m/n) = 1.7136\n\nSo m/n = 1.7136 /0.8572 \u2248 2. So m/n \u2248 2. Which suggests that the ratio of H to C is about 2:1, so the hydrocarbon is likely an alkane (since alkanes have 2H per C, formula CnH2n+2). Let me check:\n\nSuppose Z is an alkane, then H is 2n +2. The mass fraction would be (2n+2)/(12n +2n+2) = (2n+2)/(14n+2). Let's set this equal to 0.1428.\n\n(2n + 2)/(14n +2) = 0.1428\n\nMultiply both sides by (14n +2):\n\n2n +2 \u2248 0.1428*(14n +2)\n\nCompute right side: 0.1428*14n = 2.0n, and 0.1428*2\u22480.2856. So total \u22482n +0.2856\n\nLeft side: 2n +2 \u2248 2n +0.2856 \u2192 2 \u22480.2856 \u2192 Not quite. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here.",

So perhaps the original compounds in X are alkenes, and during the reaction, one becomes a more substituted alkane (maybe via some rearrangement) and another becomes something else. Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nThen, both mixtures X and Y are hydrogenated under severe conditions (so maybe even high pressure or temperature) and give the same hydrocarbon Z. Z is a constituent of Y, so one of the components of Y must be Z. But when hydrogenated, even further, Z doesn't react, so Z must be a saturated hydrocarbon (alkane).

So perhaps the original compounds in X are alkenes, and during the reaction, one becomes a more substituted alkane (maybe via some rearrangement) and another becomes something else. Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nThen, both mixtures X and Y are hydrogenated under severe conditions (so maybe even high pressure or temperature) and give the same hydrocarbon Z. Z is a constituent of Y, so one of the components of Y must be Z. But when hydrogenated, even further, Z doesn't react, so Z must be a saturated hydrocarbon (alkane). Also, the mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let's calculate the molecular formula of Z first, because that might be the key here.\n\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is roughly 1/7 (since 14.28 is approximately 100/7). Let me confirm: 14.28% H means that for every 100g of Z, 14.28g is hydrogen and 85.72g is carbon. Let's let the molecular formula be CnHm. The molar mass of Z is (12*n + 1*m). The mass fraction of H is (m/(12n + m)) *100 = 14.28. Let me set up the equation:\n\nm / (12n + m) = 0.1428\n\nLet me rearrange: m = 0.1428*(12n + m)\n\nMultiply both sides by 1,000 to eliminate decimals: 1000m = 142.8*(12n + m)\n\nHmm, maybe better to use fractions.",
