Oh, but wait, in the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is c/n. But what about in the lab frame where the glass is moving?\n\nSo, let me think about it. Let me denote the speed of light in the glass (in its rest frame) as v0 = c/n. Now, the glass is moving at velocity u = v in the same direction as the light. So, from the lab frame, what's the speed of the light?\n\nAh! I think I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula here, but wait, is that applicable? Because the velocity of light in the medium is v0, and the medium is moving at u. So, in the lab frame, the speed of the light would be (v0 + u) / (1 + (v0 u)/c\u00b2 ), but wait, no, that's for velocities adding when they're in the same direction.",
