The problem gives the RV shifts (Doppler shifts) induced by each planet. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the maximum shift. The question says Planet1 induces a shift up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the [OI] line at 6300 \u00c5. The Doppler shift \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = v/c, where v is the velocity.

The question says Planet1 induces a shift up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the [OI] line at 6300 \u00c5. The Doppler shift \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = v/c, where v is the velocity.

The problem gives the RV shifts (Doppler shifts) induced by each planet. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the maximum shift. The question says Planet1 induces a shift up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the [OI] line at 6300 \u00c5. The Doppler shift \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = v/c, where v is the velocity. So the velocity corresponding to a shift of 0.03 \u00c5 in a line at 6300 \u00c5 is (0.03 / 6300) * c. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, note that the shift is \u0394\u03bb = v \u03bb/c, so v = (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb) * c. \n\nSo for Planet1: \u0394\u03bb1 =0.03 \u00c5.

Since the problem doesn't mention inclination, perhaps we can assume sin i is the same for both planets, or that the shifts given are the maximum possible (so sin i =1). Since the problem states that both induce periodic shifts, and gives the maximum shifts, which would correspond to sin i =1. So we can proceed with that.\n\nTherefore, the K is proportional to M_p / ( M_s^(2/3) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )\n\nBut we need to relate K to the orbital period P and the semi-major axis a.

The problem gives the RV shifts (Doppler shifts) induced by each planet. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the maximum shift. The question says Planet1 induces a shift up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the [OI] line at 6300 \u00c5. The Doppler shift \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = v/c, where v is the velocity. So the velocity corresponding to a shift of 0.03 \u00c5 in a line at 6300 \u00c5 is (0.03 / 6300) * c. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, note that the shift is \u0394\u03bb = v \u03bb/c, so v = (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb) * c. \n\nSo for Planet1: \u0394\u03bb1 =0.03 \u00c5.

Since the problem doesn't mention inclination, perhaps we can assume sin i is the same for both planets, or that the shifts given are the maximum possible (so sin i =1). Since the problem states that both induce periodic shifts, and gives the maximum shifts, which would correspond to sin i =1. So we can proceed with that.\n\nTherefore, the K is proportional to M_p / ( M_s^(2/3) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )\n\nBut we need to relate K to the orbital period P and the semi-major axis a.

The problem gives the RV shifts (Doppler shifts) induced by each planet. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the maximum shift. The question says Planet1 induces a shift up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the [OI] line at 6300 \u00c5. The Doppler shift \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = v/c, where v is the velocity. So the velocity corresponding to a shift of 0.03 \u00c5 in a line at 6300 \u00c5 is (0.03 / 6300) * c. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, note that the shift is \u0394\u03bb = v \u03bb/c, so v = (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb) * c. \n\nSo for Planet1: \u0394\u03bb1 =0.03 \u00c5.

Since the problem doesn't mention inclination, perhaps we can assume sin i is the same for both planets, or that the shifts given are the maximum possible (so sin i =1). Since the problem states that both induce periodic shifts, and gives the maximum shifts, which would correspond to sin i =1. So we can proceed with that.\n\nTherefore, the K is proportional to M_p / ( M_s^(2/3) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )\n\nBut we need to relate K to the orbital period P and the semi-major axis a.

The problem gives the RV shifts (Doppler shifts) induced by each planet. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the maximum shift. The question says Planet1 induces a shift up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the [OI] line at 6300 \u00c5. The Doppler shift \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = v/c, where v is the velocity. So the velocity corresponding to a shift of 0.03 \u00c5 in a line at 6300 \u00c5 is (0.03 / 6300) * c. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, note that the shift is \u0394\u03bb = v \u03bb/c, so v = (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb) * c. \n\nSo for Planet1: \u0394\u03bb1 =0.03 \u00c5.
