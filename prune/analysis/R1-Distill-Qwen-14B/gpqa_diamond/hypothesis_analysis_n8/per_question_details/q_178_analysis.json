Let's consider the interaction term in QED: e A\u03bc \u03c8 \u03b3^\u03bc \u03c8. The Dirac field \u03c8 has [\u03c8] = 3/2. The gauge field A\u03bc has [A\u03bc] =1.

Okay, so that's correct.

Then \u03c3^{\u03bc\u03bd} is given by (i/2)[\u03b3\u03bc, \u03b3\u03bd]. The gamma matrices are dimensionless, so \u03c3^{\u03bc\u03bd} is dimensionless. So the term \u03c8\u0304 \u03c3^{\u03bc\u03bd} \u03c8: Each \u03c8 has 3/2, so total for \u03c8\u0304 and \u03c8 is 3. Then multiplied by \u03c3^{\u03bc\u03bd} (dimensionless), so overall, that part has dimension 3. Then multiplied by F^{\u03bc\u03bd}, which is dimension 2.

The Lagrangian term given is the interaction term, so we have to compute the mass dimension of \u03ba such that when multiplied by the fields and other terms, the total dimension is 4. \n\nLet me break down each component. The spinor fields \u03c8 and \u03c8\u0304 (which is \u03c8 dagger gamma zero) have a certain mass dimension. In 4 dimensions, a Dirac spinor like \u03c8 has mass dimension 3/2. Because, for example, the kinetic term for a Dirac fermion is \u03c8\u0304 \u03b3^\u03bc \u2202_\u03bc \u03c8, which must have mass dimension 4. The derivative \u2202_\u03bc has dimension 1, so each \u03c8 must be (4 - 1)/2 = 3/2. So each \u03c8 has mass dimension 3/2.\n\nThe field strength tensor F^{\u03bc\u03bd} is for a gauge field, like the electromagnetic field. The gauge field A_\u03bc has mass dimension 1, so F^{\u03bc\u03bd} is \u2202 A - \u2202 A, so each term has dimension 1 + 0 (since the derivative is dimension 1, and A has dimension 1).",
