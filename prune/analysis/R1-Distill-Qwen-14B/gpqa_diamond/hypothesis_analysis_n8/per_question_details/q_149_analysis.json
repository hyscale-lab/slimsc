Double coupling usually refers to when a proton is coupled to two different nuclei, leading to more complex splitting patterns. But the problem states that spin-spin coupling is ruled out. The question says the coupling pattern was analyzed and spin-spin isn't the reason, so maybe that's not it. So C might not be correct.\n\nOption D: diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR chemical shifts can differ. Since they are not mirror images, their mass spectra would still be the same (same molecular formula), so the LC-MS would show two peaks with same mass. The integrals adding up to 1H suggests that each peak corresponds to one of the diastereomers, each with 0.5 integral (so 50-50 mixture?), which would explain the equal intensities in LC-MS. That fits. Because diastereoisomers can have different chemical shifts, so the same proton in different diastereomers would split into two peaks.

If during the formation of an amide bond, some kind of coupling occurs that leads to splitting? But the question states that spin-spin coupling is already ruled out. So maybe this is not the case. Double coupling might be a red herring here. Not sure yet, but maybe not the right option.\n\nOption D: Diastereoisomers. Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not enantiomers, meaning they have different physical and chemical properties, including different melting points, solubility, etc. Since diastereomers have different chemical environments, their NMR spectra would show different chemical shifts.

So maybe enantiomers aren't the answer here. Unless the peaks are due to diastereomers instead?\n\nOption C: double coupling during amide bond formation. Double coupling usually refers to when a proton is coupled to two different nuclei, leading to more complex splitting patterns. But the problem states that spin-spin coupling is ruled out. The question says the coupling pattern was analyzed and spin-spin isn't the reason, so maybe that's not it. So C might not be correct.\n\nOption D: diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR chemical shifts can differ. Since they are not mirror images, their mass spectra would still be the same (same molecular formula), so the LC-MS would show two peaks with same mass. The integrals adding up to 1H suggests that each peak corresponds to one of the diastereomers, each with 0.5 integral (so 50-50 mixture?), which would explain the equal intensities in LC-MS. That fits. Because diastereoisomers can have different chemical shifts, so the same proton in different diastereomers would split into two peaks. Since the NMR is of the crude compound, maybe the reaction formed a mixture of diastereomers, which are not enantiomers. So D could be the answer.",

That fits. Because diastereoisomers can have different chemical shifts, so the same proton in different diastereomers would split into two peaks.
