But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So perhaps it's the number of stars per unit distance (i.e., dN/dr).\n\nSo, if N = k d^5, then dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the change in the number of stars with distance is proportional to d^4.",
          "text2": "Wait, but I think I'm getting confused. So the problem states that the number of stars is inversely proportional to plx^5. So, N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is a constant. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that gives N = k * (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5.\n\nBut the question is, how does the number of stars change with distance? Like, as you go further away, how does the count per unit distance change.",

Let me read it again: \"how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?\" So per unit range, which is dr. So perhaps it's the rate of change of N with r, which is dN/dr.\n\nSo if N = C r^5, then dN/dr = 5 C r^4. So the number of stars increases with r^4 per unit distance. So the correct option would be option C, which is ~ r^4.",

Let me read again.\n\nQuestion: How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?\n\nHmm. So, it's asking about the change in number per unit distance. So, it's the rate of change of N with respect to r. That would be the derivative.\n\nSo, if N \u221d r^5, then dN/dr \u221d r^4. So, the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~ r^4. So the answer should be C.",
