The question says \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2.\" So perhaps the fraction of atoms in that excited state (upper level) is twice that of star2. \n\nSo, assuming that the ratio (N_upper/N_lower)_1 is twice that of (N_upper/N_lower)_2. Let me write that as:\n\n(N1_u / N1_l) = 2*(N2_u / N2_l)\n\nBut since the stars are in LTE, the ratio for each is given by the Boltzmann formula. Let's write the Boltzmann equation for each star:\n\nFor star1: (N1_u / N1_l) = C * exp(-E/(k*T1)), where C is the statistical weight ratio (g_u/g_l), which I assume is the same for both stars since it's the same element and transition. Similarly for star2:\n\n(N2_u / N2_l) = C * exp(-E/(k*T2))\n\nSo substituting into the first equation:\n\nC exp(-E/(k T1)) = 2 * [ C exp(-E/(k T2)) ]\n\nThe C terms cancel out. So:\n\nexp(-E/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-E/(k T2))\n\nDivide both sides by the right-hand side's exponential term:\n\nexp(-E/(k T1) + E/(k T2)) = 2",
          "text2": "Wait, need to clarify. The question says \"twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". So let me parse that.\n\nSuppose the energy level in question is an excited state. Let's say the excited state is the upper level. Let me think: the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in that specific level compared to star_2. So the number of atoms in that excited level (let's call it level u) over the lower level (l) would be twice as much for star1 compared to star2. \n\nSo, the ratio (N_u/N_l)_1 = 2*(N_u/N_l)_2. \n\nUsing the Boltzmann equation, each ratio would be (g_u/g_l) * exp(-\u0394E/(k T)). Since the energy levels and the statistical weights (g_u and g_l) are the same for both stars (since they are the same element and transition), the (g_u/g_l) terms would cancel out when taking the ratio between the two stars. \n\nSo setting up the equation:\n\n(Nu/Nl)_1 / (Nu/Nl)_2 = 2 = [ exp( -\u0394E/(k T1) ) / exp( -\u0394E/(k T2) ) ]\n\nBecause the (g terms) cancel. \n\nSimplifying the exponential terms: \n\nexp( -\u0394E/(k T1) + \u0394E/(k T2) ) = 2 \n\nFactor out \u0394E/k:\n\nexp( \u0394E/(k) [ -1/(T1) + 1/(T2) ]) = 2",

          "text2": "Wait, need to clarify. The question says \"twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". So let me parse that.\n\nSuppose the energy level in question is an excited state. Let's say the excited state is the upper level. Let me think: the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in that specific level compared to star_2. So the number of atoms in that excited level (let's call it level u) over the lower level (l) would be twice as much for star1 compared to star2. \n\nSo, the ratio (N_u/N_l)_1 = 2*(N_u/N_l)_2. \n\nUsing the Boltzmann equation, each ratio would be (g_u/g_l) * exp(-\u0394E/(k T)). Since the energy levels and the statistical weights (g_u and g_l) are the same for both stars (since they are the same element and transition), the (g_u/g_l) terms would cancel out when taking the ratio between the two stars. \n\nSo setting up the equation:\n\n(Nu/Nl)_1 / (Nu/Nl)_2 = 2 = [ exp( -\u0394E/(k T1) ) / exp( -\u0394E/(k T2) ) ]\n\nBecause the (g terms) cancel. \n\nSimplifying the exponential terms: \n\nexp( -\u0394E/(k T1) + \u0394E/(k T2) ) = 2 \n\nFactor out \u0394E/k:\n\nexp( \u0394E/(k) [ -1/(T1) + 1/(T2) ]) = 2",
