The surface area at distance d is 4\u03c0 d\u00b2. The thickness in terms of distance is dd. But how does that relate to dplx?\n\nHmm, plx is 1/d, so when plx increases by dplx, d decreases by a small amount. Let's express dd in terms of dplx. From plx = 1/d, taking differentials, we have dplx = - (1/d\u00b2) dd. So dd = -d\u00b2 dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases.\n\nThe number of stars in this shell would be the number density (n) multiplied by the volume of the shell. The volume of the shell is 4\u03c0 d\u00b2 dd. So the number of stars is n * 4\u03c0 d\u00b2 dd.\n\nBut we want the number per unit plx, so we're integrating over a range in plx. Since plx = 1/d, let's substitute d in terms of plx. d = 1/plx. So d\u00b2 is (1/plx)^2, and dd is - (1/plx\u00b2) dplx.\n\nPutting it all together: number of stars in dplx is n * 4\u03c0 (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx\u00b2) dplx.",

Let me try again.\n\nThe number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is proportional to the surface area (4\u03c0d\u00b2) multiplied by the thickness of the shell (dd). So N = (number density) * 4\u03c0d\u00b2 dd.\n\nNumber density is uniform, so n = constant. So N = n * 4\u03c0 d\u00b2 dd.\n\nBut since p = 1/d, then d = 1/p. So substituting,\n\nN = n * 4\u03c0 (1/p)^2 * dd.\n\nNow, we want to express N in terms of p. Because we want the number per unit p (parallax).
