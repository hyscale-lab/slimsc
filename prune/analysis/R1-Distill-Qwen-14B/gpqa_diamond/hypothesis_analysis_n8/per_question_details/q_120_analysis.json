Since the number of stars out to distance d is proportional to d^3 (since volume is d^3 if uniform), then the number per unit distance is proportional to d\u00b2 (the surface area).

The number of stars between parallax \u03c0 and \u03c0 + d\u03c0 is equal to the number of stars between distance d and d + dd, where d = 1/\u03c0. So the volume between d and d + dd is 4\u03c0d\u00b2 dd. The number of stars would be the volume times the stellar density (which is constant, say \u03c1). So N = \u03c1 * 4\u03c0d\u00b2 dd.

          "text1": "Alternatively, think about how the volume increases with distance. The volume out to distance d is (4/3)\u03c0 d\u00b3. The volume between d and d + dd is the derivative of that, which is 4\u03c0 d\u00b2 dd, as before. So, the number of stars in that shell is proportional to d\u00b2 dd. But since we need to express it in terms of parallax, which is p = 1/d, so substituting d = 1/p, and dd = - (1/p\u00b2) dp. So substituting into the expression gives the N proportional to (1/p\u00b2) * (1/p\u00b2 dp) = 1/p^4 dp. \n\nYes, so the number per unit parallax (per dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

          "text2": "Wait, actually, if p increases by dp, then d decreases. The exact relation is d = 1/p, so dd/dp = -1/p\u00b2, so the thickness of the shell in distance is dd = - (1/p\u00b2) dp, but the absolute value would be (1/p\u00b2) dp.\n\nThe volume element is 4\u03c0d\u00b2 dd. Substituting gives 4\u03c0 (1/p\u00b2) * (1/p\u00b2 dp) = 4\u03c0/(p^4) dp. So the number of stars in that interval is n * 4\u03c0/(p^4) dp.
