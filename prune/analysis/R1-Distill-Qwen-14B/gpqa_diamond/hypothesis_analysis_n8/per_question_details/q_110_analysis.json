Let me check the wording again. \n\nThe problem says for Star3: \"apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag\". So that's the observed value, so extinction has already been accounted for. Then the E(B-V) is perhaps extra, but maybe not needed. But that would leave Star3 as 15.5, which is okay. So why is E(B-V) given? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.",
