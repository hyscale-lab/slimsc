So when the question gives Star3's apparent V magnitude, does that already account for extinction, or is it the uncorrected value? Hmm, the question says \"apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag\" and E(B-V) =0.6. Oh, so perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the observed (extincted) magnitude. But that depends on how the question is phrased. Let me read the question again.\n\n\"For Star3: apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1.\"",
