No, because but-3-enal is CH2=CHCH2CHO, so the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH=CH-CHO, which is five carbons, but the formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, not sure.\n\nOption B: 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.

After hydrolysis, the amine becomes an OH, and then the elimination forms a double bond between the adjacent CH2 groups, resulting in an enal.\n\nSo, for example, if the starting material is Ph-NH-CH2-CH2-CHO, after hydrolysis it becomes Ph-OH-CH2-CH2-CHO. Then, under KOH and heat, the two CH2 groups adjacent to the OH could lose a water molecule and form a double bond, resulting in Ph-CH2-CH=CHO.
