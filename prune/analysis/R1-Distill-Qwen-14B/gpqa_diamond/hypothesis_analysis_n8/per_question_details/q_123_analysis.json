The proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events (start and end of the 50 seconds) occur at the same location. Since in the ejecta's frame, the time is 50 seconds, that's the proper time because in that frame, the ejecta is at rest, so the two events (start and end of the time interval) are at the same place.

The proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events (start and end of the 50 seconds) occur at the same location. Since in the ejecta's frame, the time is 50 seconds, that's the proper time because in that frame, the ejecta is at rest, so the two events (start and end of the time interval) are at the same place. Therefore, the time in the other frame (Galaxy) would be longer. So yes, \u0394t = \u03b3\u0394t'.\n\nSo the time in the Galaxy frame is 50 * \u03b3.
