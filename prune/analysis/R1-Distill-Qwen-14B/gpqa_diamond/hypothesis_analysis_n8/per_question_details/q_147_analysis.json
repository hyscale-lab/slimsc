Or maybe both are considered to have negligible kinetic energy compared to their rest mass? That's a common assumption in these kinds of problems when particles are \"slowly moving.\" So perhaps their total energy is approximately their rest mass energy.\n\nThe reaction is p + p\u0304 \u2192 2A\u207a + 2A\u207b. Since charge must be conserved, each side has a charge of (proton is +1, antiproton is -1, so total 0 on the left). On the right, each A+ is +1 and each A- is -1, so 2*(+1) + 2*(-1) = 0. So charge is conserved. Good.\n\nNow, to find the velocity of particle A. Since the antiproton is slowly moving, perhaps we can assume that the initial kinetic energy is negligible, so the total energy is just the rest mass energy of the proton plus the antiproton. Let me note that the rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c\u00b2, so the total rest mass energy of the system is 2*938 = 1876 MeV. \n\nThe products are four particles of A (two positive, two negative).

But maybe the standard approach here is to consider that the initial particles are at rest, so their total momentum is zero, so the final particles must also have zero net momentum. Therefore, the two positive and two negative particles must move in such a way that their momenta cancel out. But since there are two of each, maybe they are moving symmetrically in opposite directions. \n\nSo the key here is to calculate the velocity of the particles A. Since the mass of A is given as m_A c\u00b2 = 300 MeV. The proton mass is about 938 MeV/c\u00b2. Since the antiproton has the same mass as the proton, the total rest mass energy of the initial system is 2*938 = 1876 MeV.

No, so the simplest assumption is that the four particles are emitted symmetrically in opposite directions, each with the same magnitude of momentum. Let me model the system such that two go in the +x direction and two in the -x direction, each with momentum p and -p respectively. Then the total momentum would be (2p - 2p) = 0. So the momentum of each pair cancels. \n\nTherefore, each particle (regardless of charge) has the same magnitude of momentum p, but direction opposite for the pairs. Since they all have the same mass, their speeds would be the same. So each particle's momentum is p, so the total energy of each particle is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_A c\u00b2)^2 ).

So we can treat them as moving at speed v, with momentum p = gamma * m_A * v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. \n\nNow, energy conservation.

No, so the simplest assumption is that the four particles are emitted symmetrically in opposite directions, each with the same magnitude of momentum.

So the momentum of each pair cancels. \n\nTherefore, each particle (regardless of charge) has the same magnitude of momentum p, but direction opposite for the pairs. Since they all have the same mass, their speeds would be the same. So each particle's momentum is p, so the total energy of each particle is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_A c\u00b2)^2 ). Since there are four particles, the total energy is 4 * sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_A c^2)^2 ). \n\nThis total energy must equal the initial rest mass energy of the proton and antiproton, which is 2*(m_p c\u00b2).

That's a common assumption in these kinds of problems when particles are \"slowly moving.\" So perhaps their total energy is approximately their rest mass energy.\n\nThe reaction is p + p\u0304 \u2192 2A\u207a + 2A\u207b. Since charge must be conserved, each side has a charge of (proton is +1, antiproton is -1, so total 0 on the left). On the right, each A+ is +1 and each A- is -1, so 2*(+1) + 2*(-1) = 0. So charge is conserved. Good.\n\nNow, to find the velocity of particle A. Since the antiproton is slowly moving, perhaps we can assume that the initial kinetic energy is negligible, so the total energy is just the rest mass energy of the proton plus the antiproton. Let me note that the rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c\u00b2, so the total rest mass energy of the system is 2*938 = 1876 MeV. \n\nThe products are four particles of A (two positive, two negative). Each has a mass of 300 MeV/c\u00b2. So the total rest mass energy of the products is 4*(300) = 1200 MeV.",

Therefore, the two positive and two negative particles must move in such a way that their momenta cancel out. But since there are two of each, maybe they are moving symmetrically in opposite directions. \n\nSo the key here is to calculate the velocity of the particles A.

Since they all have the same mass, their speeds would be the same. So each particle's momentum is p, so the total energy of each particle is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_A c\u00b2)^2 ). Since there are four particles, the total energy is 4 * sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_A c^2)^2 ). \n\nThis total energy must equal the initial rest mass energy of the proton and antiproton, which is 2*(m_p c\u00b2). Since the antiproton is slowly moving, its kinetic energy is negligible, so we can approximate the initial energy as 2*m_p c\u00b2. \n\nSo setting up the equation:\n\n4 * sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_A c\u00b2)^2 ) = 2 * m_p c\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n2 * sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_A c\u00b2)^2 ) = m_p c\u00b2\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n4 [ (p c)^2 + (m_A c\u00b2)^2 ] = (m_p c\u00b2)^2 \n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n( (p c)^2 + (m_A c\u00b2)^2 ) = ( (m_p c\u00b2)^2 ) /4 \n\nRearranged:\n\n(p c)^2 = ( (m_p c\u00b2)^2 ) /4 - (m_A c\u00b2)^2 \n\nLet me compute that. Let me plug in the numbers. Let me note the given m_A c\u00b2 = 300 MeV. m_p c\u00b2 is the proton mass energy, which is approximately 938 MeV. Let me confirm: the rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c\u00b2, so that's correct. \n\nPlugging in numbers:\n\nLeft side of the equation after squaring:\n\nThe term ( (m_p c^2)^2 ) /4 - (m_A c^2)^2 \n\n= ( (938)^2 /4 ) - (300)^2 \n\nCalculating each term:\n\n938 squared is 938*938. Let me compute that. 900\u00b2 is 810000, 38\u00b2 is 1444, and cross terms 2*900*38 = 2*34200=68400. So total (900+38)^2 = 900\u00b2 + 2*900*38 +38\u00b2 = 810000 + 68400 +1444 = 810000+68400 is 878400 +1444 is 879,844. So 938^2 is 879,844 (MeV\u00b2). \n\nSo (879,844)/4 = 219,961 (MeV^4 / c^4?",

That's a common assumption in these kinds of problems when particles are \"slowly moving.\" So perhaps their total energy is approximately their rest mass energy.\n\nThe reaction is p + p\u0304 \u2192 2A\u207a + 2A\u207b. Since charge must be conserved, each side has a charge of (proton is +1, antiproton is -1, so total 0 on the left). On the right, each A+ is +1 and each A- is -1, so 2*(+1) + 2*(-1) = 0. So charge is conserved. Good.\n\nNow, to find the velocity of particle A. Since the antiproton is slowly moving, perhaps we can assume that the initial kinetic energy is negligible, so the total energy is just the rest mass energy of the proton plus the antiproton.
