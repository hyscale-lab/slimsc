Hermitian operators have real eigenvalues, so their eigenvalues can't have imaginary parts. That makes me think option A is wrong because it mentions imaginary parts. \n\nOption B talks about imaginary parts being \u00b11/2 and real parts \u00b11. But again, eigenvalues must be real here, so B is incorrect. \n\nOption C says the eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A\u00b2 (which would be the square of the angular momentum operator, like A_x\u00b2 + A_y\u00b2 + A_z\u00b2) but not of Az. Hmm, for spin-1/2 particles, the eigenstates of one component (like Ay) are not eigenstates of another component (like Az), which is correct. However, the eigenstates of Ay should also be eigenstates of A\u00b2 because angular momentum operators commute with their squares. Since A\u00b2 commutes with each component, any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A\u00b2. So the first part of C is correct. The second part (not of Az) is correct too. So maybe C is a candidate. \n\nOption D says the eigenfunctions \u03c6 of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix Ay.",
