If you add a substance that causes the reaction to release more heat (exothermic), then if you increase the temperature (due to the reaction's own exothermic nature), the system might shift to counteract the temperature increase. For an exothermic reaction, increasing the temperature would shift the equilibrium to the left (reverse reaction), slowing the forward reaction.

Since the reaction was initially in an acidic environment, and the product has H+ ions, maybe the reaction requires H+ as a catalyst or part of the reactants. If the pH increased, that means lower H+ concentration, so the rate would drop. That would make option B the correct answer. \n\nBut what about the temperature? The container got hot, so maybe the temperature increased. However, in exothermic reactions, the rate might actually be affected by temperature in a different way. For instance, if a reaction is exothermic, increasing the temperature would usually shift the equilibrium (Le Chatelier's principle), but here, the question is about the rate of the reaction. If the reaction is exothermic, then adding heat (like in this case due to the exothermic process) could actually slow down the reaction because it's like adding a product (heat).
