The carbonyl at 1720 is a bit more towards the lower end; carboxylic acids typically have around 2500-1750 (but maybe 1720 is possible for esters or other groups). Hmm, maybe I should note that the IR suggests either an acid or an ester. The broad O-H would point more towards carboxylic acid.\n\nMoving on to the \u00b9H NMR data. There's a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which is a very high field for a proton.

The NMR shows a singlet at 11 ppm (the COOH's OH), then two doublets at 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). Let's think about the structure. For 4-chlorobenzoic acid: the aromatic protons would be split into two sets. For example, the protons adjacent to the substituents would have different coupling. Let's consider the structure where the Cl is at position 4 and the COOH is at position 1 (since it's benzoic acid, the COOH is on the ring). The other substituent (Cl) is at position 4. The remaining protons would be positions 2, 3, 5, 6. But the exact splitting would depend on their positions.",

The Cl is at position 4, so that's the substituent. \n\nSo for option B (4-chlorobenzoic acid), the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. The positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) would be around 8 ppm as a doublet, and positions 3 and 5 (meta to COOH) at around 7.7 as another doublet. That matches the NMR data given (8.02 d 2H and 7.72 d 2H). \n\nLooking at option D (2-chlorobenzoic acid), the Cl is at position 2 (ortho to the COOH). So in this case, the structure would have COOH at 1 and Cl at 2. The aromatic protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6. The ortho Cl would affect the chemical shifts. The proton at position 6 (meta to COOH and ortho to Cl?), perhaps the structure would have different shifts. The presence of Cl next to the COOH might lead to different coupling. Let me think of the shifts here. The ortho Cl would cause more deshielding, so maybe the 6 position (meta to COOH) would be higher? Not sure, but the splitting might be different.",
