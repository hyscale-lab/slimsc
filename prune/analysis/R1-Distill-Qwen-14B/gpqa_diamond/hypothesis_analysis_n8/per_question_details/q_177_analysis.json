That's probably where I went wrong earlier. The problem states that through spectroscopy, they found the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. But the radial velocities mean that the observed wavelengths are shifted. Therefore, to find the actual temperatures (and thus actual peak wavelengths), we need to adjust for the Doppler effect. \n\nSo the observed peak wavelength for Star_2 would be shifted due to its velocity. Since Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, which is moving away (since it's positive?), so the observed lambda_max(observed) = lambda_max(actual) * (1 + v/c). But since the speed is much less than c, maybe we can use the non-relativistic approximation.",

So to have the same observed peak, Star2's intrinsic peak must be shorter, hence higher temperature (since T is inversely proportional to \u03bb_max). \n\nTherefore, T2 is higher than T1. \n\nTherefore, the temperatures of the two stars are different. \n\nSo now, the luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = [4\u03c0\u03c3 R1\u00b2 T1^4]/[4\u03c0\u03c3 R2\u00b2 T2^4] = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. \n\nWe know R1/R2 is 1.5. \n\nWe need to find T1/T2.

For instance, in the mass-luminosity relation, but that's more for main sequence stars where L ~ M^3.5 or something. But the problem says to assume they radiate as black bodies, so we have to use the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The mass given might be a red herring. Since the problem says to compute luminosity as black bodies, then mass isn't directly needed here. So the mass information is perhaps irrelevant.",

For example, if the stars are main sequence stars, mass and luminosity are related by the mass-luminosity relation, but that's L \u221d M^a, where a is around 3-4 for main sequence stars. But the problem says to assume they radiate as black bodies, so that relation might not apply here. The question specifies to use the black body assumption, so Stefan-Boltzmann is the way to go.",
