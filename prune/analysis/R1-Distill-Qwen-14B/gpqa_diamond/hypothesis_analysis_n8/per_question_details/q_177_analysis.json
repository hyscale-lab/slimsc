          "text2": "Wait, but the stars have different radii and masses. But same temperature. Interesting. So, their luminosities must be different because luminosity depends on radius and temperature.\n\nThe question says the astronomers calculated the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So what's the formula for luminosity of a star as a blackbody?\n\nOh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4\u03c0 R\u00b2 \u03c3 T\u2074. Where L is luminosity, R is radius, \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is temperature. Since both are blackbodies, this formula applies.\n\nSo the problem is comparing L1 and L2. Let me write that out.\n\nL1 = 4\u03c0 R1\u00b2 \u03c3 T1\u2074\nL2 = 4\u03c0 R2\u00b2 \u03c3 T2\u2074\n\nBut from the given, R1 = 1.5 R2, and T1 = T2 (since lambda_max is same, so T same).\n\nSo substituting R1 = 1.5 R2 and T1 = T2 into L1 and L2:\n\nL1 = 4\u03c0 (1.5 R2)\u00b2 \u03c3 T\u00b2\nL2 = 4\u03c0 R2\u00b2 \u03c3 T\u00b2\n\nSo the ratio L1/L2 is [ (1.5)^2 R2\u00b2 \u03c3 T\u00b2 ] / [ R2\u00b2 \u03c3 T\u00b2 ].",

So the star moving towards us (negative velocity) or away (positive) would have their wavelengths shifted. So the observed \u03bb_max is different from the rest \u03bb_max. But in the question, they must have determined the actual \u03bb_max by correcting for the radial velocity. Because if you don't correct for that, the observed \u03bb_max would differ, but the problem states that the \u03bb_max they determined are the same. So maybe they accounted for the Doppler shift.\n\nLet me think. The observed wavelength is \u03bb = \u03bb_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. So if Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s (assuming v_r is positive when moving away, or is it the other way around?), but wait, the exact sign depends on the convention. Let's clarify: if the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, so \u03bb increases.

          "text1": "Wait, but regardless of whether it's moving towards or away, the Doppler shift formula is symmetric in a way. Because moving towards causes blueshift (shorter \u03bb), moving away causes redshift (longer \u03bb).\n\nBut the problem states that the observed \u03bb_max is the same for both. Therefore, if Star_1 has zero radial velocity, its emitted and observed \u03bb_max are same. Star_2 must have its emitted \u03bb_max adjusted by the Doppler shift to match.\n\nBut I think I'm getting stuck in a loop here. Let me try to approach this differently.\n\nSo, to restate:\n\nWe have two stars emitting blackbody radiation. Each has a peak wavelength \u03bb_max (emitted) determined by their temperature via Wien's law: \u03bb_max = b / T.\n\nStar_1's observed \u03bb_max is the same as its emitted \u03bb_max because its radial velocity is zero. So \u03bb1_obs = \u03bb1_emit.\n\nStar_2 has a radial velocity v (700 km/s). The observed \u03bb_max is \u03bb2_obs = \u03bb2_emit * D, where D is the Doppler factor.\n\nBut the problem states that \u03bb1_obs = \u03bb2_obs.\n\nSo,\n\n\u03bb1_emit = \u03bb2_emit * D.\n\nSo,\n\n\u03bb2_emit = \u03bb1_emit / D.\n\nBut D depends on whether Star_2 is moving towards or away.\n\nIf Star_2 is moving towards us, D = sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) < 1, so \u03bb2_emit > \u03bb1_emit. Since \u03bb is inversely proportional to T, T2 < T1.\n\nIf Star_2 is moving away, D = sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) > 1, so \u03bb2_emit < \u03bb1_emit. Thus, T2 > T1.\n\nSo depending on direction, the temperature ratio can be higher or lower.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the direction. So perhaps I should assume it's moving away, which would lead to T2 > T1, and a higher luminosity ratio.",
          "text2": "Alternatively, the Doppler shift formula is sometimes written as \u03bb_obs = \u03bb_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), but that's for relativistic speeds. However, 700 km/s is about 0.23% of the speed of light, so non-relativistic approximation should suffice.\n\nIn the non-relativistic case, \u03bb_obs \u2248 \u03bb_rest * (1 + v_r / c ), where v_r is the radial velocity (positive when moving away). So if Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength would be longer. But since both stars have the same observed \u03bb_max, Star_2's rest wavelength must be shorter to compensate. Because if Star_2 is moving away, its observed \u03bb would be longer. So to have the same observed \u03bb as Star_1, which has v_r=0, Star_2 must have a shorter rest wavelength. Since \u03bb_rest is inversely proportional to T, that would mean Star_2 has a higher temperature than Star_1.",
