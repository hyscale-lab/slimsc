So, the period of P2 is 0.36 times that of P1. So, the ratio P2/P1 is approximately 0.364 \u2192 0.36.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So the answer should be A.",
          "text2": "Wait, but that's 125/343 \u2248 0.364. So P2 is 0.364 times P1. So planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's.\n\nBut the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\n\nSo P2 is shorter, so it's less than 1 times. So the ratio P2/P1 is about 0.364. So the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.",

So P2's period is 0.36 times that of P1, meaning it's about 36% as long. So it's shorter, not longer.\n\nSo the correct answer would be A, 0.36 times as long. So P2 is ~0.36 times the period of P1.",
