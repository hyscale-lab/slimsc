Therefore, the adjacent carbons to the carbonyl would be part of the benzene ring. Since they are part of the aromatic ring, they can't easily lose a proton to form an enol. Because the alpha carbon (the one adjacent to the carbonyl) is part of the aromatic ring, which is conjugated and stabilized, so the protons there are not acidic enough to form enol tautomers. \n\nTherefore, benzoquinone doesn't undergo tautomerism. \n\nOn the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups. Let's imagine the structure: cyclohexane ring with ketone groups on carbons 1,3, and 5. Each of those carbons has a C=O group. The adjacent carbons (like carbon 2 and 6 for the first ketone) might allow for tautomerism. For example, each ketone could potentially form an enol form where the double bond moves and a proton shifts. Because the carbonyl groups are separated by one carbon (since 1,3,5 are alternate positions), there's space for the tautomerism. \n\nTherefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism, so the compound that does NOT is benzoquinone. \n\nSo part A is benzoquinone (so options B and D are possible). \n\nFor part B, as discussed, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (the second carbon), so it has optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound (trans), so it doesn't. \n\nThus the correct answer is option B.",
          "text2": "Wait, in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is on a carbon, so for example, the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O. So maybe the enol form would involve moving the double bond to a different position. However, in the case of 1,4-benzoquinone, the ring is aromatic. If you form an enol, you might disrupt the aromaticity. Since aromatic rings are highly stable, that might not be favorable. So perhaps benzoquinone doesn't tautomerize because that would break the aromatic ring. Therefore, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism (so A would be benzoquinone). \n\nOn the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which is a non-aromatic ring, might be able to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Since it's a cyclohexane ring with three ketones, maybe each of the ketones can shift into enol forms. Since there's no aromatic stabilization, such tautomerism might be feasible. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would show tautomerism, so the answer for A is the one that does NOT show tautomerism. So A would be benzoquinone (option B or D). \n\nNow moving on to part B. The question is between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.
