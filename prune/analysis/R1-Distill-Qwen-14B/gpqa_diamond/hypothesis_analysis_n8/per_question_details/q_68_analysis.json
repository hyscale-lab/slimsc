          "text1": "Wait, the key here is that initially, the magnetic moment is aligned with B in the Z direction, so that's why the state is an eigenstate of Sz. Then when the field is turned to the Y direction, the Hamiltonian changes, leading to time evolution of the spin state, and hence the expectation value of Sz (since we're looking at the z-component of the moment) will oscillate. The question is about the frequency of that oscillation.\n\nSo let me think of the standard approach here. When the magnetic field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy, because the energy is -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since \u03bc is given as \u03b3 Sz, then H would be - (\u03b3 Sz) * B_y-direction.",

But the initial state is aligned with the field, so Sz is maximum. \n\nBut when the magnetic field is turned off and then turned on along Y, the new Hamiltonian is H_new = -\u03bc\u00b7B_new = -\u03b3 S \u00b7 B_y. Since B is along Y, that would be -\u03b3 S_y B. Because the vector S dotted into the B vector which is along Y gives S_y component multiplied by B. So H_new = -\u03b3 B S_y.\n\nHmm. Now, the problem is about the time evolution of the z-component of the magnetic moment after the field is switched. The particle was initially in the state |+z\u27e9, but when the Hamiltonian changes, the state will evolve according to the new Hamiltonian. We need to find the expectation value of \u03bc_z as a function of time, which is \u03b3 times the expectation value of Sz. Since \u03bc_z = \u03b3 Sz, so \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 = \u03b3 \u27e8Sz\u27e9. The question is about the oscillation frequency of this \u27e8Sz\u27e9 over time.\n\nSo to find the oscillation frequency, we need to compute how \u27e8Sz\u27e9 varies with time under the new Hamiltonian. Let's think about this step by step.\n\nThe initial state is |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9. The Hamiltonian is now H = -\u03b3 B S_y. The time evolution of the state is governed by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The time-dependent state will be |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = exp(-i H t / \u0127) |\u03c8(0)\u27e9.\n\nFirst, let's write the Hamiltonian in terms of matrices. For spin 1/2 particles, S_y is represented by the Pauli matrix multiplied by \u0127/2. The Pauli matrix for Y is:\n\n\u03c3_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\nSo S_y = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y.

Let's write the matrix form of this state.

Then when the field is turned to the Y direction, the Hamiltonian changes, leading to time evolution of the spin state, and hence the expectation value of Sz (since we're looking at the z-component of the moment) will oscillate. The question is about the frequency of that oscillation.\n\nSo let me think of the standard approach here. When the magnetic field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy, because the energy is -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since \u03bc is given as \u03b3 Sz, then H would be - (\u03b3 Sz) * B_y-direction.",

But the initial state is aligned with the field, so Sz is maximum. \n\nBut when the magnetic field is turned off and then turned on along Y, the new Hamiltonian is H_new = -\u03bc\u00b7B_new = -\u03b3 S \u00b7 B_y. Since B is along Y, that would be -\u03b3 S_y B. Because the vector S dotted into the B vector which is along Y gives S_y component multiplied by B. So H_new = -\u03b3 B S_y.\n\nHmm. Now, the problem is about the time evolution of the z-component of the magnetic moment after the field is switched. The particle was initially in the state |+z\u27e9, but when the Hamiltonian changes, the state will evolve according to the new Hamiltonian. We need to find the expectation value of \u03bc_z as a function of time, which is \u03b3 times the expectation value of Sz. Since \u03bc_z = \u03b3 Sz, so \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 = \u03b3 \u27e8Sz\u27e9. The question is about the oscillation frequency of this \u27e8Sz\u27e9 over time.\n\nSo to find the oscillation frequency, we need to compute how \u27e8Sz\u27e9 varies with time under the new Hamiltonian. Let's think about this step by step.\n\nThe initial state is |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9. The Hamiltonian is now H = -\u03b3 B S_y. The time evolution of the state is governed by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The time-dependent state will be |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = exp(-i H t / \u0127) |\u03c8(0)\u27e9.\n\nFirst, let's write the Hamiltonian in terms of matrices. For spin 1/2 particles, S_y is represented by the Pauli matrix multiplied by \u0127/2. The Pauli matrix for Y is:\n\n\u03c3_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\nSo S_y = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y.

Let's write the matrix form of this state.

Then when the field is turned to the Y direction, the Hamiltonian changes, leading to time evolution of the spin state, and hence the expectation value of Sz (since we're looking at the z-component of the moment) will oscillate. The question is about the frequency of that oscillation.\n\nSo let me think of the standard approach here. When the magnetic field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy, because the energy is -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since \u03bc is given as \u03b3 Sz, then H would be - (\u03b3 Sz) * B_y-direction.",

But the initial state is aligned with the field, so Sz is maximum. \n\nBut when the magnetic field is turned off and then turned on along Y, the new Hamiltonian is H_new = -\u03bc\u00b7B_new = -\u03b3 S \u00b7 B_y. Since B is along Y, that would be -\u03b3 S_y B. Because the vector S dotted into the B vector which is along Y gives S_y component multiplied by B. So H_new = -\u03b3 B S_y.\n\nHmm. Now, the problem is about the time evolution of the z-component of the magnetic moment after the field is switched.

The time-dependent state will be |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = exp(-i H t / \u0127) |\u03c8(0)\u27e9.\n\nFirst, let's write the Hamiltonian in terms of matrices.

Then when the field is turned to the Y direction, the Hamiltonian changes, leading to time evolution of the spin state, and hence the expectation value of Sz (since we're looking at the z-component of the moment) will oscillate. The question is about the frequency of that oscillation.\n\nSo let me think of the standard approach here. When the magnetic field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy, because the energy is -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since \u03bc is given as \u03b3 Sz, then H would be - (\u03b3 Sz) * B_y-direction.",

But the initial state is aligned with the field, so Sz is maximum. \n\nBut when the magnetic field is turned off and then turned on along Y, the new Hamiltonian is H_new = -\u03bc\u00b7B_new = -\u03b3 S \u00b7 B_y. Since B is along Y, that would be -\u03b3 S_y B. Because the vector S dotted into the B vector which is along Y gives S_y component multiplied by B. So H_new = -\u03b3 B S_y.\n\nHmm. Now, the problem is about the time evolution of the z-component of the magnetic moment after the field is switched.

The time-dependent state will be |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = exp(-i H t / \u0127) |\u03c8(0)\u27e9.\n\nFirst, let's write the Hamiltonian in terms of matrices.

Then when the field is turned to the Y direction, the Hamiltonian changes, leading to time evolution of the spin state, and hence the expectation value of Sz (since we're looking at the z-component of the moment) will oscillate. The question is about the frequency of that oscillation.\n\nSo let me think of the standard approach here. When the magnetic field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy, because the energy is -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since \u03bc is given as \u03b3 Sz, then H would be - (\u03b3 Sz) * B_y-direction.",

But the initial state is aligned with the field, so Sz is maximum. \n\nBut when the magnetic field is turned off and then turned on along Y, the new Hamiltonian is H_new = -\u03bc\u00b7B_new = -\u03b3 S \u00b7 B_y. Since B is along Y, that would be -\u03b3 S_y B. Because the vector S dotted into the B vector which is along Y gives S_y component multiplied by B. So H_new = -\u03b3 B S_y.\n\nHmm. Now, the problem is about the time evolution of the z-component of the magnetic moment after the field is switched.

The time-dependent state will be |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = exp(-i H t / \u0127) |\u03c8(0)\u27e9.\n\nFirst, let's write the Hamiltonian in terms of matrices.

Then when the field is turned to the Y direction, the Hamiltonian changes, leading to time evolution of the spin state, and hence the expectation value of Sz (since we're looking at the z-component of the moment) will oscillate. The question is about the frequency of that oscillation.\n\nSo let me think of the standard approach here. When the magnetic field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy, because the energy is -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since \u03bc is given as \u03b3 Sz, then H would be - (\u03b3 Sz) * B_y-direction.",

But the initial state is aligned with the field, so Sz is maximum. \n\nBut when the magnetic field is turned off and then turned on along Y, the new Hamiltonian is H_new = -\u03bc\u00b7B_new = -\u03b3 S \u00b7 B_y. Since B is along Y, that would be -\u03b3 S_y B. Because the vector S dotted into the B vector which is along Y gives S_y component multiplied by B. So H_new = -\u03b3 B S_y.\n\nHmm. Now, the problem is about the time evolution of the z-component of the magnetic moment after the field is switched. The particle was initially in the state |+z\u27e9, but when the Hamiltonian changes, the state will evolve according to the new Hamiltonian. We need to find the expectation value of \u03bc_z as a function of time, which is \u03b3 times the expectation value of Sz. Since \u03bc_z = \u03b3 Sz, so \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 = \u03b3 \u27e8Sz\u27e9. The question is about the oscillation frequency of this \u27e8Sz\u27e9 over time.\n\nSo to find the oscillation frequency, we need to compute how \u27e8Sz\u27e9 varies with time under the new Hamiltonian. Let's think about this step by step.\n\nThe initial state is |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9. The Hamiltonian is now H = -\u03b3 B S_y. The time evolution of the state is governed by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The time-dependent state will be |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = exp(-i H t / \u0127) |\u03c8(0)\u27e9.\n\nFirst, let's write the Hamiltonian in terms of matrices. For spin 1/2 particles, S_y is represented by the Pauli matrix multiplied by \u0127/2. The Pauli matrix for Y is:\n\n\u03c3_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\nSo S_y = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y.

Then when the field is turned to the Y direction, the Hamiltonian changes, leading to time evolution of the spin state, and hence the expectation value of Sz (since we're looking at the z-component of the moment) will oscillate. The question is about the frequency of that oscillation.\n\nSo let me think of the standard approach here. When the magnetic field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy, because the energy is -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since \u03bc is given as \u03b3 Sz, then H would be - (\u03b3 Sz) * B_y-direction.",

But the initial state is aligned with the field, so Sz is maximum. \n\nBut when the magnetic field is turned off and then turned on along Y, the new Hamiltonian is H_new = -\u03bc\u00b7B_new = -\u03b3 S \u00b7 B_y. Since B is along Y, that would be -\u03b3 S_y B. Because the vector S dotted into the B vector which is along Y gives S_y component multiplied by B. So H_new = -\u03b3 B S_y.\n\nHmm. Now, the problem is about the time evolution of the z-component of the magnetic moment after the field is switched. The particle was initially in the state |+z\u27e9, but when the Hamiltonian changes, the state will evolve according to the new Hamiltonian. We need to find the expectation value of \u03bc_z as a function of time, which is \u03b3 times the expectation value of Sz. Since \u03bc_z = \u03b3 Sz, so \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 = \u03b3 \u27e8Sz\u27e9. The question is about the oscillation frequency of this \u27e8Sz\u27e9 over time.\n\nSo to find the oscillation frequency, we need to compute how \u27e8Sz\u27e9 varies with time under the new Hamiltonian. Let's think about this step by step.\n\nThe initial state is |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9. The Hamiltonian is now H = -\u03b3 B S_y. The time evolution of the state is governed by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The time-dependent state will be |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = exp(-i H t / \u0127) |\u03c8(0)\u27e9.\n\nFirst, let's write the Hamiltonian in terms of matrices. For spin 1/2 particles, S_y is represented by the Pauli matrix multiplied by \u0127/2. The Pauli matrix for Y is:\n\n\u03c3_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\nSo S_y = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y.

Then when the field is turned to the Y direction, the Hamiltonian changes, leading to time evolution of the spin state, and hence the expectation value of Sz (since we're looking at the z-component of the moment) will oscillate. The question is about the frequency of that oscillation.\n\nSo let me think of the standard approach here. When the magnetic field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy, because the energy is -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since \u03bc is given as \u03b3 Sz, then H would be - (\u03b3 Sz) * B_y-direction.",

But the initial state is aligned with the field, so Sz is maximum. \n\nBut when the magnetic field is turned off and then turned on along Y, the new Hamiltonian is H_new = -\u03bc\u00b7B_new = -\u03b3 S \u00b7 B_y. Since B is along Y, that would be -\u03b3 S_y B. Because the vector S dotted into the B vector which is along Y gives S_y component multiplied by B. So H_new = -\u03b3 B S_y.\n\nHmm. Now, the problem is about the time evolution of the z-component of the magnetic moment after the field is switched. The particle was initially in the state |+z\u27e9, but when the Hamiltonian changes, the state will evolve according to the new Hamiltonian. We need to find the expectation value of \u03bc_z as a function of time, which is \u03b3 times the expectation value of Sz. Since \u03bc_z = \u03b3 Sz, so \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 = \u03b3 \u27e8Sz\u27e9. The question is about the oscillation frequency of this \u27e8Sz\u27e9 over time.\n\nSo to find the oscillation frequency, we need to compute how \u27e8Sz\u27e9 varies with time under the new Hamiltonian. Let's think about this step by step.\n\nThe initial state is |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9. The Hamiltonian is now H = -\u03b3 B S_y. The time evolution of the state is governed by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The time-dependent state will be |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = exp(-i H t / \u0127) |\u03c8(0)\u27e9.\n\nFirst, let's write the Hamiltonian in terms of matrices. For spin 1/2 particles, S_y is represented by the Pauli matrix multiplied by \u0127/2. The Pauli matrix for Y is:\n\n\u03c3_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\nSo S_y = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y.

Let's write the matrix form of this state. In the standard basis (with Sz eigenstates along z), |+z\u27e9 is [1; 0].\n\nBut to compute the time evolution, we might need to express the state in terms of the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian.",

Then when the field is turned to the Y direction, the Hamiltonian changes, leading to time evolution of the spin state, and hence the expectation value of Sz (since we're looking at the z-component of the moment) will oscillate. The question is about the frequency of that oscillation.\n\nSo let me think of the standard approach here. When the magnetic field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy, because the energy is -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since \u03bc is given as \u03b3 Sz, then H would be - (\u03b3 Sz) * B_y-direction.",

But the initial state is aligned with the field, so Sz is maximum. \n\nBut when the magnetic field is turned off and then turned on along Y, the new Hamiltonian is H_new = -\u03bc\u00b7B_new = -\u03b3 S \u00b7 B_y. Since B is along Y, that would be -\u03b3 S_y B. Because the vector S dotted into the B vector which is along Y gives S_y component multiplied by B. So H_new = -\u03b3 B S_y.\n\nHmm. Now, the problem is about the time evolution of the z-component of the magnetic moment after the field is switched. The particle was initially in the state |+z\u27e9, but when the Hamiltonian changes, the state will evolve according to the new Hamiltonian. We need to find the expectation value of \u03bc_z as a function of time, which is \u03b3 times the expectation value of Sz. Since \u03bc_z = \u03b3 Sz, so \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 = \u03b3 \u27e8Sz\u27e9. The question is about the oscillation frequency of this \u27e8Sz\u27e9 over time.\n\nSo to find the oscillation frequency, we need to compute how \u27e8Sz\u27e9 varies with time under the new Hamiltonian. Let's think about this step by step.\n\nThe initial state is |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9. The Hamiltonian is now H = -\u03b3 B S_y. The time evolution of the state is governed by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The time-dependent state will be |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = exp(-i H t / \u0127) |\u03c8(0)\u27e9.\n\nFirst, let's write the Hamiltonian in terms of matrices. For spin 1/2 particles, S_y is represented by the Pauli matrix multiplied by \u0127/2. The Pauli matrix for Y is:\n\n\u03c3_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\nSo S_y = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y.
