A typical pinacol would have two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons, with other substituents.

The product is a ketone on the first carbon of a cyclohexane ring with two p-tolyl groups on carbon 2. So let's see:\n\nThe product is a cyclohexanone (so the ring has 6 carbons). The two p-tolyl groups are on carbon 2. The ketone is on carbon 1. \n\nLooking at the starting material (A), before rearrangement, the two hydroxyl groups must be on carbons adjacent to the ketone position.",
