Protonation of the oxygen occurs, leading to the loss of water and the formation of an imine (Schiff base).\n\n3.

Enamine formation typically uses acid catalysts, but the choice between TsOH and acetic acid might depend on the conditions.\n\nTsOH is a strong acid and is often used as a catalyst in such reactions because it's a non-nucleophilic acid, meaning it doesn't participate in the reaction beyond protonation steps. Acetic acid is also a mild acid, but it's possible that TsOH is more effective in this case.",

A proton is lost, leading to the formation of an enol, which then eliminates water to form a double bond.\n\nSo the product would have a structure where the amine is attached to a CH\u2082 group connected to a cyclohexene ring.

Acetic acid is also a common acid catalyst.\n\nWhich one is more appropriate? I know that in some cases, TsOH is used when the reaction requires a strong acid, but in others, acetic acid is sufficient. For enamine formation, both could be possible, but perhaps TsOH is more commonly used as a catalyst in such reactions because it's a strong acid and can better protonate the carbonyl oxygen.",
