So for a given exposure time, S/N \u221d sqrt( flux ). So if you have two stars with magnitudes m1 and m2, then S/N2/S/N1 = sqrt(10^{-0.4(m2 - m1)}).\n\nIn the example, when S/N is 100 at m=14, then for S/N of 10, you can have:\n\n10/100 = sqrt(10^{-0.4\u0394m})\n\n=> 0.1 = 10^{-0.2\u0394m}\n\nTake log10 both sides:\n\nlog10(0.1) = -1 = -0.2\u0394m \u2192 \u0394m = 5. \n\nSo the magnitude difference is +5 (since the star is fainter). Thus the limiting magnitude for S/N=10 would be 14 +5 =19. \n\nAh, so the limiting magnitude would be V ~19.",
