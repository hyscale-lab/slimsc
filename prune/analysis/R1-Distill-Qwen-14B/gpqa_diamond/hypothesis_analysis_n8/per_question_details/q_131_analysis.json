So perhaps the anhydride is a symmetrical structure, like (CH2)2O-C(=O)-O-C(=O)-(CH2)2, but with the central alkene? Hmm, maybe it's a cyclic anhydride. For example, a five-membered ring containing the two carbonyl groups and the alkene. Like, in a cyclohexene ring with two oxygens in the ring? Not sure.",
