So the neutrinos from pp-III up to that time (8.5 min ago) have already been emitted and are en route. But after that point, the pp-III stopped, so subsequent neutrinos from pp-III are not produced. \n\nTherefore, the flux from pp-III would have just stopped arriving. So the current flux from pp-III is zero. \n\nTherefore, the current flux is only from other sources, like pp-I (\u2077Be decay), and other branches like pep or pp-0 (the rare ones). \n\nThe \u2077Be neutrinos contribute to both bands as we discussed. \n\nThe other possible neutrino sources contributing to these energy bands are:\n\n- pep reaction: this produces a neutrino with energy ~1.16 MeV. The 1.16 MeV is 1160 keV, so the neutrino's maximum energy is higher than the upper band (900 keV). So their spectrum would extend into the 800-900 keV band.",
          "text2": "Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch does contribute to those higher energy bands, which would mean that stopping it would reduce the flux in those bands. \n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. Let me re-examine the question. \n\nThe question states that the pp-III branch has just stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Since neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, the stopping would mean that neutrinos from that branch would stop arriving after the 8.5 minutes (the light travel time from Sun to Earth). So the flux from pp-III has been stopped, but other branches are still running. \n\nThe question is about the flux ratio between band1 (700-800) and band2 (800-900). \n\nIf pp-III's neutrinos are not in those bands (since they're around 350 keV), then their flux doesn't contribute here. So the flux in both bands comes from other sources, like B-8 decay (which is part of pp-I, which is still active). So the ratio would depend on B-8's neutrino spectrum. \n\nThe B-8 neutrinos have a maximum energy of ~15 MeV. The flux as a function of energy is roughly proportional to (E_nu)^2 (1 - E_nu/E_max)^2, where E_max is the maximum energy (approximate for the B-8 decay). So the flux decreases as energy increases, but not linearly. \n\nThe energy bands are 700-800 (band1) and 800-900 (band2). Since B-8's neutrinos go up to 15 MeV, both these bands are within the B-8 range. \n\nThe exact flux ratio depends on the integral of the flux over those ranges. \n\nAssuming the flux is proportional to (E)^2 (1 - E/(15 MeV))^2. Let me approximate the function's behavior between 0.7 MeV and 0.9 MeV. \n\nLet me compute the function at 750 keV (mid of band1) and 850 keV (mid of band2). \n\nAt 750 keV: E = 0.75 MeV. \n\nThe term (1 - E/E_max) is 1 - 0.75/15 = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95 \n\nSo the flux at this point would be proportional to (0.75)^2 * (0.95)^2 \u2248 0.5625 * 0.9025 \u2248 0.507 \n\nAt 850 keV (0.85 MeV):\n\n(0.85)^2 * (1 - 0.85/15)^2 \n\n1 - 0.85/15 = 1 - 0.056666... \u2248 0.9433 \n\nSo (0.7225) * (0.9433)^2 \u2248 0.7225 * 0.89 = ~0.645",
