Therefore, M1/M2 = K2/K1. So for system 1, K1=10, K2=5. So M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5. Therefore M1 = 0.5 M2. So total mass of system1 is M1 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

So when taking the ratio K1/K2, the constants and (M_total)^(2/3) P^(1/3) terms would cancel out. So K1/K2 = (M2)/(M1). \n\nExactly, that simplifies things. So for each system, the ratio of the K values gives the inverse of the mass ratio. So in system_1, K1 is 10 km/s and K2 is 5 km/s. So K1/K2 = 10/5 = 2 = M2/M1. Therefore, M2 = 2*M1. \n\nSo the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = M1 + 2M1 = 3M1. \n\nBut we need to also involve the period here because the mass of the system is related to the period.

Because so far, the ratio of masses in each system depends on their velocity ratio, but the actual total mass depends on the period. \n\nAh right, because the velocities and the orbital period are related via Kepler's third law. \n\nSo, the total mass of the system is proportional to (K^3 * P)/(sin^3 i). Since sin i is 1, then the total mass is proportional to (K^3 * P).",

So when taking the ratio K1/K2, the constants and (M_total)^(2/3) P^(1/3) terms would cancel out. So K1/K2 = (M2)/(M1). \n\nExactly, that simplifies things. So for each system, the ratio of the K values gives the inverse of the mass ratio. So in system_1, K1 is 10 km/s and K2 is 5 km/s. So K1/K2 = 10/5 = 2 = M2/M1. Therefore, M2 = 2*M1. \n\nSo the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = M1 + 2M1 = 3M1. \n\nBut we need to also involve the period here because the mass of the system is related to the period.

So when taking the ratio K1/K2, the constants and (M_total)^(2/3) P^(1/3) terms would cancel out. So K1/K2 = (M2)/(M1). \n\nExactly, that simplifies things. So for each system, the ratio of the K values gives the inverse of the mass ratio. So in system_1, K1 is 10 km/s and K2 is 5 km/s. So K1/K2 = 10/5 = 2 = M2/M1.
