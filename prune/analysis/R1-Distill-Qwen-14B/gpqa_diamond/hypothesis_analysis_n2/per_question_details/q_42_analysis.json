Let me compute that. 5.29 *2 \u224810.58, but 5.29 *1.96 is 5.29*(2 -0.04) = 10.58 - 0.2116 = ~10.3684.

Since all these planets are around the same star, the ratio of their periods depends only on their semi-major axes. The exact formula is P^2 \u221d a^3. Therefore, the ratio of periods squared is equal to the ratio of their semi-major axes cubed. \n\nSo, we need to find P3/P1. Let's compute (a3/a1)^(3/2). Since a3/a1 is ~10.37, then (10.37)^(3/2). Let's compute that. \n\nFirst, square root of 10.37 is approx 3.22 (since 3.22^2 is 10.3684). Then 10.37^(3/2) is (sqrt(10.37))^3 = 3.22^3. Let's calculate 3.22 cubed. 3^3 is 27, 0.22^3 is small, but let's do it step by step. 3.22 *3.22 = 10.3684, then multiply by 3.22 again. 10.3684 *3 = 31.1052, plus 10.3684 *0.22 \u22482.281, so total ~31.1052 +2.281\u224833.386.

          "text2": "Wait wait, the question says the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. The wording here could be ambiguous. Let me read again: \"the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4\" \u2014 so that's T1/T2 = 1.4. Then between Planet2 and Planet3, it's 2.3 \u2014 so that would be T2/T3 = 2.3, meaning Planet2 is hotter than Planet3, so Planet3 is farther out. \n\nSo T2/T3 = 2.3, so D3/D2 = (T2/T3)^2 = (2.3)^2 \u2248 5.29. So D3 is about 5.29 times D2. \n\nPutting those together, let's express D2 and D3 in terms of D1. \n\nD2 = 1.96 * D1 \n\nD3 = 5.29 * D2 = 5.29 * 1.96 * D1 \n\nCalculating that: 5.29 * 1.96. Let me compute that. 5 * 1.96 is 9.8, and 0.29*1.96 is about 0.5684. Total is around 10.3684. So D3 \u2248 10.3684 * D1. \n\nNow, to find the orbital period ratio of Planet3 to Planet1. Since they orbit the same star, we can use Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance). \n\nSo P^3 / D^3 = constant. So P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2). \n\nWe already have D3/D1 \u2248 10.3684. \n\nCalculating (10.3684)^(3/2). Let's see. The square root of 10.3684 is about 3.22 (since 3.2^2 is 10.24, so a bit higher). So sqrt(10.3684) \u2248 3.22. Then 10.3684^(3/2) = 10.3684 * 3.22 \u2248 10.3684 * 3.22. Let's compute that:\n\n10 * 3.22 = 32.2, and 0.3684 * 3.22 \u2248 1.186. Total is 32.2 +1.186\u224833.386. So approximately 33.4.",
