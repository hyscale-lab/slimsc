We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)\u2082]^0. So that's the species with two SCN per Co. So, its stability constant is \u03b22=40.",

That might mean that the fourth complex is less stable than the third. That's unusual, but possible.\n\nBut the question is about the percentage of dithiocyanato complexes, which are the Co(SCN)_2^0 species. So n=2.",
