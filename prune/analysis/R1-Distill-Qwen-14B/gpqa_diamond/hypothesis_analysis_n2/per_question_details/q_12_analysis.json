So the momentum p here is in units of MeV/c. Because m is in MeV/c\u00b2, so m c\u00b2 is MeV. So the momentum p has units of MeV/c. So the value of p here is approximately 29.8 MeV/c.\n\nNow, with p known, compute the energies.\n\nFirst, the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p c = 29.8 MeV (since pc gives energy in MeV when p is in MeV/c, because c is 1 in the units).\n\nThe muon's energy is sqrt( (105.7)^2 + (29.8)^2 )\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n105.7 squared is 11172.49 (since 100\u00b2 is 10000, 105\u00b2 is 11025, 105.7^2 = (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105\u00b2 + 2*105*0.7 + 0.49 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49).\n\n29.8 squared is approx (30 -0.2)^2 = 900 - 12 + 0.04 = 888.04. \n\nSo adding those gives 11172.49 + 888.04 = 12060.53\n\nTake square root of that: sqrt(12060.53) \u2248 let's see. 110^2 is 12100, so sqrt(12060.53) is about 109.8.

So that's correct.\n\nDenominator is 2*139.6 =279.2.\n\nThus, p =8315.67 /279.2 \u2248 let's do this division more accurately.\n\n279.2 \u00d729.7 = ?\n\n279.2 \u00d730 =8376, so 29.7 is 0.3 less. So 279.2 \u00d70.3 =83.76. So subtract that from 8376: 8376 -83.76 = 8292.24.\n\nHmm, so 279.2 \u00d729.7 = 8292.24. But the numerator is 8315.67. The difference is 8315.67 -8292.24=23.43.\n\nSo 23.43 /279.2 \u2248 ~0.084. So total p\u224829.7 +0.084\u224829.784 MeV/c. So approximately 29.78 MeV/c.\n\nSo p \u224829.78 MeV/c. Okay, that's the momentum of each particle (muon and neutrino).\n\nNow, let's find the kinetic energies.\n\nFirst, the muon's kinetic energy.\n\nThe total energy of the muon is E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2). Since we set c=1, units in MeV.\n\nSo, p was 29.78, m_mu is 105.7.\n\nSo E_mu = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )\n\nCalculating that:\n\n29.78 squared: approx 29.78^2 = let's see:\n\n30^2 is 900, subtract (0.22)^2 and cross terms?",
