          "text1": "Alternatively, perhaps it's C3H, as in a point group with a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror. But I'm not exactly certain about the exact point groups. Maybe I should think about the structures regardless.\n\nLet me go back.\n\nTriisopropyl borate: Structure is a central boron connected to three isopropyl groups. So each is the same. So the molecule is symmetric with a three-fold axis. So when you rotate 120 degrees, it looks the same. So that would mean it has at least C3 symmetry. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane as well? Well, the molecule is in a trigonal planar arrangement, with the boron in the center. So if there's a plane going through the boron and the midpoints of the isopropyl groups, that would be a mirror plane. So perhaps it has more than just C3 symmetry. Maybe it's D3h or something else. But the question is which has C3H symmetry. If C3H is just the three-fold rotation, then triisopropyl borate has that.\n\nQuinuclidine: It's a cage compound with a bridged bicyclic structure. I think it has a plane of symmetry, but perhaps not three-fold. Let me imagine the structure. Quinuclidine has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane system. So, the molecule has two bridgeheads and three bridges. So, the symmetry might be lower. I'm not entirely sure, but I don't think it's C3.\n\nOption B: The benzo-trifuran. The name suggests a benzo ring fused to three furans in a particular way.",
          "text2": "Wait, triisopropyl borane would have three isopropyl groups attached to boron. Oh but it's triisopropyl borate, so maybe it's a trigonal planar geometry with three substituents. If the molecule is symmetric with a threefold rotation axis, but does it have a mirror plane?\n\nOption D: Quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, a bridge structure. I'm not sure about its symmetry. It has a chair-like structure, but I don't recall it having a threefold axis. Maybe it's more like a C2 symmetry? Or maybe no high symmetry.",
