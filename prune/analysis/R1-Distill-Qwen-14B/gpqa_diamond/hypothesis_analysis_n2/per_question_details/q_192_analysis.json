          "text1": "Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that any charges inside the cavity (like +q) will cause the inner surface of the conductor to have an induced charge of -q. The outer surface must have +q because the conductor is neutral. Now, the electric field outside the conductor is determined by the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q.\n\nBut where is this +q located? Since the outer surface is a sphere, the charges are uniformly distributed. So the electric field outside would be as if the charge were at the center of the sphere. So E should be (1/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080)) * (q)/(L\u00b2), because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P. So looking at the options, option B is that.",
