The substituents on product's 3,4,5 correspond to diene's 4,5,6. \n\nSo the diene must have a methyl on C4, methyl on C5, and isopropyl on C6. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption B: octa-2,6-diene. Let's see what that's like. \n\nOcta-2,6-diene would have double bonds between 2-3 and 6-7. \n\nThe substituents on the product would then have to come from different positions.",
