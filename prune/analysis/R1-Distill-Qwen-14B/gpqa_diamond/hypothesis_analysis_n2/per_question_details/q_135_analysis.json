The bottom is about 4.5 GeV, I think. So each b quark is ~4.5 GeV. So 2 * 4.5 =9 GeV, which is larger than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar because 6 GeV is less than 9 GeV. So b quarks are out.\n\nWhat about the charm quark? Charm is like 1.5 GeV. So 2 * 1.5 is 3 GeV, which is exactly half of X's mass. So that's allowed. So X can decay into c c-bar.\n\nSimilarly, up quark is like 2 MeV, so 2 * 2 MeV is negligible, so X can decay into u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, etc.\n\nWhat about the electron, muon? Their masses are way below 3 GeV, so their pairs are allowed.\n\nSo putting this together, the allowed decay channels are any fermion pairs where each fermion is less than 3 GeV. So possible pairs are u, d, s, c, tau, and the leptons e and mu.",
