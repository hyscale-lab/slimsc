That's fine.\n\nSo all the quark and lepton pairs in B are allowed except maybe the c quarks. Let's see:\n\nc quark mass ~1.275 GeV. So two of them sum to ~2.55, which is less than 6, so allowed. So all the decays in B are possible.\n\nNow option C includes t\u0304t, which is 173 each, so sum over 300 GeV, way too big. So C is out.\n\nOption D includes b\u0304b: sum over 8 GeV which is over 6, so D is invalid.\n\nTherefore the correct answer must be B?",

So c pair is 2.56 GeV, which is under 6. So that's okay. \n\nThe tau pair: \u03c4 is ~1.777 GeV each, so total 3.55 GeV, which is under 6.

So D also has that decay, so D is invalid. \n\nSo A and D have b b\u0304 which is not allowed, so they can't be correct. So now between B and C. But C includes top, which is way too heavy.
