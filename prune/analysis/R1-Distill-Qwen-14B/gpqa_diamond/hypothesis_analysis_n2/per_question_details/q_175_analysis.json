So the dependence on \u03bb would be \u03bb^-4, so the function f is proportional to \u03bb^-4. So the options, if the angular dependence is sin\u00b2\u03b8 and the \u03bb dependence is \u03bb^-4, then the fraction at \u03b8=30 is 1/4, so that would correspond to option C (1/4, \u03bb^-4).",

Now, the other part is the dependence on lambda. The question says the function f depends on lambda and theta. The radiated power per unit solid angle in the radiation zone for dipole radiation depends on 1/lambda^4, right? Since the intensity (power per unit area) for dipole radiation is proportional to (1/lambda^4) * (sin^2(theta)), I think.",
