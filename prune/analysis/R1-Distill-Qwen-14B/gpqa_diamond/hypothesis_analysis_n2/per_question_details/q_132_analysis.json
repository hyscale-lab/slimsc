The arrangement is 1,2,3 (three adjacent), and position5. The symmetry here is different. Let me try to see equivalence:\n\nPosition1,2,3 are all adjacent methyls. Position5 is across from where? Position5 is opposite position2? Not sure. Let's see:\n\nThe four methyl groups are at 1,2,3,5. The remaining H's are at4 and6. Let's look for symmetry. The molecule might not have much symmetry. For example:\n\nPositions1,2,3 are methyls, so they form a block. Position5 is another methyl. The remaining H's are at4 and6. \n\nThe methyl at position5 is adjacent to position4 (H) and position6 (H?), wait no. Let me think again. Position5 is between 4 and6.

Similarly, the methyl groups at 2 and 5 are also para. So two types of methyl groups. So two signals for their methyl groups.\n\nThe second compound, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:\n\nThe methyl groups are at 1,2,3,5. Let's see:\n\nPositions 1,2,3 are consecutive. The methyl at position 3 is adjacent to 2 (methyl) and 4 (H). The methyl at position 5 is across from 2. The methyl at position 1 is adjacent to 6 (H) and 2 (methyl). \n\nSo the methyl at 1 is in a different environment than the methyl at 3 and 5.
