For pair production via two photons (since one is from CMB), the minimum energy required for the high-energy photon can be found using the conservation laws. Let me set this up.\n\nLet me denote the energy of the high-energy gamma as E (which is the one we need to find), and the energy of the CMB photon as \u03b5. The average CMB photon energy here is given as 1e-3 eV. But since the CMB has a Planck spectrum, the peak wavelength is around 1 mm, so the average energy is indeed very low. \n\nThe total energy in the center-of-mass frame must be at least 2m_e c\u00b2. Since both photons are moving towards each other (assuming they are head-on), the total energy in their center-of-mass frame would be E + \u03b5.",
