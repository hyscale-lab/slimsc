          "text1": "Wait, but the original question says \"which of those equations are different\". The options given are A, B, C, D. Let's look at the options again:\n\nA) The one related to divergence of B. (Only that equation changes? But maybe not.)\n\nB) The ones related to the circulation of E and divergence of B. (Circulation of E is Faraday's Law, so that would mean two equations: div B and Faraday's?)\n\nC) The ones related to circulation of B and flux of E. (Circulation of B is Amp\u00e8re's Law, flux of E is Gauss's Law for E, which might not be changed.)\n\nD) The ones related to divergence and curl of B. (div B and curl B?)\n\nHmm. So let's think again. The existence of monopoles would affect the divergence of B (so equation 2 changes). Also, Amp\u00e8re's Law (equation 4) would need a term for the magnetic current.",
          "text2": "Wait, the original Amp\u00e8re's Law with Maxwell's addition is curl B = \u03bc\u2080(J + \u03b5\u2080 \u2202E/\u2202t). If there are magnetic monopoles, then there would be a magnetic current, say J_m, so maybe the right-hand side would include that. Also, Gauss's Law for Magnetism would have a term like divergence B = \u03bc\u2080 \u03c1_m (if \u03c1_m is magnetic charge density). \n\nSo, in that case, the divergence of B equation would change (so A and D both involve divergence of B). But D says divergence and curl of the magnetic field. The curl of B's equation (Amp\u00e8re's Law) would also change if there are magnetic currents. Therefore, both the divergence and the curl equations for B would change. \n\nLooking at the options again. The question is which equations are different. \n\nOriginal equations:\n\n1. Div E = \u03c1/\u03b5\u2080 (unchanged, since electric charges still exist)\n2. Div B = 0 (this would change to Div B = \u03bc\u2080 \u03c1_m or something)\n3. Curl E = -\u2202B/\u2202t (Faraday's, which doesn't involve monopoles directly, unless there's a term here)\n4. Curl B = \u03bc\u2080 J + \u03bc\u2080 \u03b5\u2080 \u2202E/\u2202t (this would need to include a term from the magnetic current, perhaps similar to electric current.",
