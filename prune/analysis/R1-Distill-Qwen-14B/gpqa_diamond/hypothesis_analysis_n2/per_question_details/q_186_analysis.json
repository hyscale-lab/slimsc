The 2.2.1 indicates the number of atoms in each bridge. The numbering starts at a bridgehead, and the bridges are between bridgeheads and other carbons. \n\nLet me imagine the structure as follows (this is a bit hard without a diagram, but here goes):\n\nThe bicyclo[2.2.1] system has two bridgeheads (positions 1 and 5). The bridge connecting them has two carbons (the 2.2 part). The other bridge connects positions 2 and 4 (the .1 part).",

The double bond is between carbons 5 and 6 (since it's hept-5-ene). \n\nLet me try to draw this structure as best as I can mentally. Let's imagine the bicyclic system. Let's say the bridgeheads are 1, 4, and 7 (since it's a heptane, 7 carbons). The bridges are 2,2,1. The numbering would go around the rings. Let's see:\n\nThe bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has three rings: the two 2-carbon bridges and one 1-carbon bridge. Let me think of it as follows:\n\n- The first bridge connects carbons 1 and 4 (the 1-carbon bridge?",
