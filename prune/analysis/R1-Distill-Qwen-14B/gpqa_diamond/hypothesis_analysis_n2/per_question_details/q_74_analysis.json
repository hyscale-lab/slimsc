Let's see, maybe approximate it. Let me see, e^-0.385 is about e^-0.4 is 0.67, so that would be right. So \u03bb \u2248 0.38566 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute. \n\nNow, the question is, given that the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?
