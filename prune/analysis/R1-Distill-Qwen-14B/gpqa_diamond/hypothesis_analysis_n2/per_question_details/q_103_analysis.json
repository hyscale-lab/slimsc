Let's see:\n\nIf first nitration, then nitro group is on the benzene. Then bromination would be directed by nitro group. Since nitro is a meta-director, the bromine would go to meta to the nitro. Then, when we acetylate, the acetyl group (which is also a meta-director) would be placed in a position that's meta to both? But the positions need to fit the target's 3 and 5 positions.",
