So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3, which makes the double bond between C1 and C2, with the p-tolyl on C2. So the acceptor is a good Michael acceptor because it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl.\n\nThe donor is dimethyl malonate, which can form an enolate. The enolate would attack the beta position of the acceptor. So the malonate has two ester groups and a central CH2. The enolate will form on the central carbon and attack the acrylate.\n\nSo when the enolate attacks the acrylate, the two molecules combine. The malonate has two methyl ester groups on either side of the central CH2. So the product would have three ester groups attached.",
