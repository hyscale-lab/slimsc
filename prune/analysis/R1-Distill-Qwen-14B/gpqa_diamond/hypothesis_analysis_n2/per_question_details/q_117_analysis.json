Since fumaric acid is the trans isomer, its dimethyl ester would also be trans. However, optical isomerism requires a chiral center.",
          "text2": "Wait, no. Let me get this right. Fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is:\n\nOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3 instead of a single bond. So the correct structure is:\n\nHOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the two carboxyl groups are on carbons 1 and 4 (if the double bond is between 2 and 3). \n\nNow, when it's dimethyl fumarate, both carboxylic acids are esterified with methyl groups. So the structure would be OOCMe-CH=CH-COOMe (where Me is methyl). \n\nNow, can this have optical isomerism? Well, the molecule is a trans diene. The two methyl esters are on the same side?",
