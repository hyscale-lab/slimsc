The strong peak at 1700 would be the carbonyl group (C=O) in a carboxylic acid or ester. Since we have a carboxylic acid, the 1700 cm-1 is consistent with that.

So carbons 3 and 4 each have an ethyl group (C2H5) as a substituent.

The CH2 group on carbon2 has two protons. The adjacent carbons are carbon1 (CH3, which has 3 H) and carbon3 (which has an ethyl group (C2H5) so the carbon3 itself has an H (since it's C(H)(C2H5)), so the H on carbon3 is adjacent to the CH2 (carbon2) and carbon4.",
