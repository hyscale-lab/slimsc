But the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So the lab frame would see the light's speed as (c/n) + v?",

So if the medium (the glass) is moving relative to the lab frame, how do we compute the speed of light in that medium as observed in the lab?\n\nI think this involves adding velocities using the relativistic addition formula. Because the glass is moving, the light's velocity as seen from the lab would be the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity in the glass frame, but relativistically.",
