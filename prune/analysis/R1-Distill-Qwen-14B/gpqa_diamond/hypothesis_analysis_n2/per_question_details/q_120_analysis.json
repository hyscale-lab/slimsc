          "text1": "Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try a different approach. Let's express the number of stars in terms of parallax.\n\nThe number of stars in a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx is proportional to the volume of that shell. The volume of a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr is approximately 4\u03c0 d\u00b2 dr. But dr is related to dplx because d = 1/plx. So when plx changes by dplx, d changes by dr = - (1/plx^2) dplx. So, dr = - (dplx)/(plx^2).\n\nSo, substituting into the volume:\n\ndV = 4\u03c0 d\u00b2 dr = 4\u03c0 (1/plx)^2 * ( - dplx/(plx^2) ) )\n\nThe negative sign indicates direction, but since we're considering the absolute value, we'll take the positive:\n\ndV = 4\u03c0 (1/plx\u00b2) * (dplx / plx\u00b2 ) ) = 4\u03c0 (dplx / plx^4 )\n\nSo, the number of stars in that shell is n * dV, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume). So the number of stars is n * 4\u03c0 dplx / plx^4.\n\nBut the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So the number of stars per unit plx (dplx) is (n *4\u03c0 / plx^4 ) dplx. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.",
