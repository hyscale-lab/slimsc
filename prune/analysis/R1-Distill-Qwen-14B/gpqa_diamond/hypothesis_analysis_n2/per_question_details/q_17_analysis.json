The initial concentrations before complexation: if the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, then the initial concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA would be zero, right? No, wait, no. Because the complex is formed from Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA. If the solution is 0.02 M of the complex, then the total concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M. \n\nBut in the complex, the Ca is in the form of Ca-EDTA, so the total concentration is [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M. The rest of the solution has Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4- in very small concentrations.",

But what are [Ca\u00b2+] and [EDTA^4-]?\n\nIn a stoichiometric solution, the moles of Ca and EDTA are equal. So the total concentration of Ca\u00b2+ is [Ca\u00b2+] + [CaEDTA\u00b2-] = 0.02 M.",
