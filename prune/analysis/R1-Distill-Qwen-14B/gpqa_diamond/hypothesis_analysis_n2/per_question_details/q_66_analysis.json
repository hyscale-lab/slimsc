Hmm, the question's first two options are Lorentz and Poincare. Since the operators must respect both? Well, Lorentz is part of Poincare. So if Poincare is required, then Lorentz is included. But maybe the question is considering them as separate because sometimes people might think of Lorentz transformations without translations.",
