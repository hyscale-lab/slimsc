          "text1": "Wait, but in heterozygous, so 50% are mutant and 50% wild. So each Y would pair with either Y or WT. If Y can't form dimers, then maybe the Y-Y pairs are non-functional, but Y-WT pairs also can't form functional dimers. So the total number of functional dimers (WT-WT) is reduced. So the loss of function occurs. \n\nThus the molecular problem is that the dimerization is impaired. The proteins can't form functional dimers. So the molecular phenotype is that dimerization is lost, leading to loss of function, which is the dominant-negative effect. So the answer would be something that says the dimerization is lost. \n\nLooking at the options again. \n\nOption C says \"loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype\". That can't be right because loss of dimerization would mean no function, so the phenotype would be loss of function. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption B: \"protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele\" \u2014 perhaps the mutant Y causes the wild-type protein to be degraded. That would be a different mechanism. Like, the mutant protein forms a complex that is tagged for destruction. But that's a possible scenario.",
          "text2": "Alternatively, perhaps the dominant-negative here is because the mutant protein can form dimers but they are non-functional. Since the mutation is in dimerization, maybe the mutant can pair with WT but the dimer is non-functional. So, in a heterozygote, half the possible dimers are WT-WT, and half are WT-Y (assuming equal amounts). But if the WT-Y dimers don't work, then 50% of the dimers are non-functional, leading to a significant loss. But dominant-negative would mean that even a small amount of mutant causes a strong effect. Maybe the mutant somehow outcompetes the WT in dimerization, making most dimers non-functional. \n\nIn this case, the molecular phenotype would be loss of dimerization leading to loss of function. But the options don't have that exactly. Let's check the options again.\n\nOption B says protein degradation and loss of wild-type allele. So, if Y causes the wild-type proteins to be degraded, that would explain a dominant-negative effect. But how?",
