So the question is about what happens at the molecular level when Y is present.\n\nOption D says protein aggregation and loss of function. So the mutant might cause the proteins to aggregate, leading to their inability to function. So the presence of Y leads to aggregation (due to misfolding perhaps) of the proteins, and that makes them not functional. So the phenotype is loss of function.",
          "text2": "Wait, but what about the presence of the wild-type allele. If Y is dominant-negative, then the mutant Y protein would interfere with the wild-type's ability to form functional dimers. So even if you have some wild-type proteins, they can't pair up correctly because they're mixing with Y mutants, leading to ineffective dimerization. So the cell can't transcribe the genes properly, hence loss of function.\n\nSo in the presence of Y, the dimerization doesn't happen properly. Which would lead to the inability of the transcription factor to function. So the molecular phenotype would be loss of dimerization, leading to loss of function.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D says protein aggregation and loss-of-function. Aggregation might happen if the mutant proteins can't form correct dimers, causing them to clump. So the outcome is loss of function because the TF isn't active. So D seems correct.",

So perhaps the presence of Y leads to the mutant and wild-type proteins being degraded, leading to loss of function.\n\nSo in that case, the molecular phenotype would involve protein degradation (as in option B).
