Ethanethiolate: that's the conjugate base of ethanethiol (ethanethiol is CH3CH2SH, so the conjugate base would be CH2CH2S^-? So ethanethiolate is (CH3CH2)S^-.\n\nNow, to rank them in terms of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution. Since water is a polar protic solvent, the solvation effect is significant. In such solvents, nucleophilicity is inversely related to the strength of the hydrogen bonding between the solvent and the nucleophile. Stronger bases (i.e., those with more negative charge on a small atom) are more solvated and thus less nucleophilic in polar protic solvents.",
          "text2": "Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Methanol as a nucleophile would have to donate its oxygen's lone pair. But since it's a neutral molecule, it's much less nucleophilic than the anions like hydroxide or ethanethiolate. Because anions are better nucleophiles than neutral molecules. So methanol would be the least here.\n\n5. Ethanethiolate (CH3CH2S^-): That's the conjugate base of ethanethiol (ethanol's sulfur analog). Sulfur is less electronegative than oxygen, so the thiolate ion (RS-) is a stronger nucleophile than the corresponding alkoxide. Because the sulfur is larger and the lone pair is more accessible.",
