          "text1": "Oh wait, the problem says the transition corresponds to 1448 \u00c5, which is about 144.8 nm. That's in the UV range, but I'm not sure how that directly affects this.\n\nSo for each scenario (no spots, spots), I need to calculate the ratio (n1/n2) and then find the factor.\n\nFirst, when there are no spots, Teff is 6000 K. When spots cover 40% of the surface, the overall Teff is 5500 K.",
          "text2": "But wait, wait a second. Oh, wait, no. Because when a star has spots, those spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So the total flux emitted by the star decreases, but the effective temperature is an average based on the total luminosity. So the problem says that the Teff is 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered. So the star's overall Teff is lower than when there are no spots.\n\nBut the question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 is lower than when it doesn't. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes, i.e., (N1/N2) without spots divided by (N1/N2) with spots.",
