Now I need to think again if the first issue (mutually incompatible data formats) is indeed a common source of hard-to-spot errors. Suppose two data sets are in slightly different formats that are similar but not the same. For example, BED files can have optional fields, or different column orders. If a tool misinterprets those, maybe it would lead to incorrect results without an error. So that could be a problem. But maybe that's less common? Or perhaps in practice, people are more likely to have issues with the naming conventions (chr/no chr) and reference mismatches, which are more about coordinate systems, which are fundamental to genomics analyses.",
