          "text1": "Wait, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, so 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...\n\nSo \u03b3 is approximately 3.57142857. \n\nTherefore, the total energy would be 5.60305 GeV * 3.57142857 \u2248 let me compute that. \n\nFirst, 5 *3.57142857 = 17.85714285\n\n0.60305 * 3.57142857:\n\nLet me compute 0.6 *3.57142857 = 2.14285714\n\n0.00305 *3.57142857 \u22480.010886. \n\nAdding those: 2.14285714 +0.010886 \u22482.153743.\n\nSo total energy is 17.85714285 +2.153743 \u224820.010885 GeV. \n\nHmm, so that's approximately 20.01 GeV. But the options are A)18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419. So closest is C)20.132.",
          "text2": "Wait, 0.28^2 is 0.0784. Yes! So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. Therefore gamma is 1/0.28 \u2248 3.57142857...\n\nSo gamma is approximately 3.5714. Then total energy E = gamma * m c\u00b2 = 3.5714 * 5.603 GeV. Let's compute that. \n\nFirst, 3.5 *5.603 = let's see, 3*5.603 is 16.809, plus 0.5*5.603 =2.8015, so total 16.809 +2.8015 =19.6105. Then the remaining 0.0714 *5.603. 0.07*5.603 is 0.39221, and 0.0014*5.603 is ~0.007844, so total ~0.39221 +0.007844\u22480.40005. So total E \u224819.6105 +0.4 \u224820.0105 GeV. Hmm, that would be around 20.01 GeV. The closest option is C) 20.132 GeV.",
