          "text1": "Wait, the question mentions radial velocities. The velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. But how does that affect luminosity? Luminosity is intrinsic, so maybe it's a red herring? Because the luminosity is the intrinsic brightness, while radial velocity would affect the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift, but since they already accounted for the peak wavelength (they said through spectroscopy they determined the wavelengths at which they appeared brightest are the same), so the Doppler shift must have been corrected for. So the temperatures are indeed the same. \n\nTherefore, the mass difference shouldn't matter here. The problem says to assume they radiate as black bodies, so the formula should hold. Then the luminosity ratio is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the answer should be A. But the options include A) ~2.25, so that's the first thought.",

So the actual temperatures are the same. Therefore, the radial velocity doesn't affect the calculation here. So the mass still isn't part of the calculation.
