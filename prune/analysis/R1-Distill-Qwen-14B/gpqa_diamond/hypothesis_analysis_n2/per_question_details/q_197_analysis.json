So the compound has aromatic rings.\n\nSo now, the NMR data:\n\nThe 1H NMR shows several signals.\n\nFirst, a peak at 10.5 ppm, broad singlet, 1H.

For example, substituents that are electron-withdrawing or donating.\n\nLooking back at the IR, the peaks at 1610 and 1450: Those could be the C=C stretches of the aromatic ring, possibly with substituents. Also, the 1720 could be a carbonyl, maybe an ester or ketone or acid. But if the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad peak, that's more indicative of a carboxylic acid because the -OH in a carboxylic acid is broad.
