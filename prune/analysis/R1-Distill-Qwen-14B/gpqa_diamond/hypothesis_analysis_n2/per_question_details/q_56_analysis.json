The final state (l=0) has parity +1. So each transition must involve a parity change. Since dipole transitions conserve parity (because the dipole moment is an odd operator, so the transition must change parity). Let me confirm: the dipole transition operator is proportional to r (the position vector), which is an odd parity operator. So the matrix element \u27e8f|m e r| i\u27e9 requires that the parity of the final state is opposite to the initial state. Because the parity of the operator r is (-1)^1 = -1. So the total parity must flip. So for each transition, the parity of the initial and final states must be different.\n\nTherefore, first transition from n=3, l=0 (parity +1) must go to a state with parity -1. The intermediate must have l=1 (parity -1), which is okay. Then from the intermediate (parity -1) to the final state (parity +1) is also okay. So that's consistent. So all the paths in the options are allowed in terms of parity.\n\nNow, the probabilities.

Let's check: the \u0394l here is -1 (from 1 to 0), which is okay. The m changes from 1 to 0, which is \u0394m = -1, allowed. So that's also an allowed transition.

Hmm, but the question says \"the transition route and the corresponding probability\". So which one has the correct probability?\n\nNow, the probabilities. The question is probably referring to the relative probabilities of the different paths. The total probability would depend on the matrix elements for each transition.

The matrix element for a dipole transition involves the angular part, which depends on the integral over the spherical harmonics of Y_{l' m'} * Y_{lm} * Y_{1 m'}, because the dipole operator has angular dependence of l=1 (since it's a vector).
