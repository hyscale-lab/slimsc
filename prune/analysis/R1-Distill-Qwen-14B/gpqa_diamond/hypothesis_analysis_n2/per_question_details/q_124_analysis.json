Because the decay length is L, so the probability of surviving to distance R is exp(-R/L). Therefore, the fraction that reach the detector is exp(-R/(v gamma tau)).",

Also, since v = \u03b2c, so substituting that in, the distance would be \u03b2 c * \u03b3 \u03c4. \n\nBut let's see, the distance they must reach is 30 meters. So the condition is that the distance they can travel (v * lifetime in lab frame) must be at least 30 meters. \n\nSo, the distance is v * \u03b3 \u03c4 >= 30 m. \n\nBut since we are comparing two different scenarios (the original case and the desired case), maybe we can set up a ratio. Let's let the original scenario have Lorentz factor \u03b31 = 20, and the desired scenario have \u03b32 which is the answer we need to find. \n\nThe fraction of particles that reach the detector depends on how many have lifetimes long enough that their traveled distance is at least 30 meters. Assuming that the decay is exponential (since it's a fast-decaying particle, probably following an exponential decay law), the probability that a particle travels a distance d is proportional to exp(-d/(v * \u03b3 \u03c4)).",
