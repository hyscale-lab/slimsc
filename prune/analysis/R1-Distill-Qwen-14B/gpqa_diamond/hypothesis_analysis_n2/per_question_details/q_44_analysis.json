Maybe this could affect mitochondria, but I'm not sure if this directly tests mitochondrial function.\n\nOption B: Transformation with recombinant luciferase and adding luciferin. Oh, wait, luciferase is an enzyme that produces light in the presence of luciferin. Recombinant luciferase might be used as a reporter. But how would this relate to mitochondria? If the cells are transformed with luciferase, maybe it's under a promoter that's active when mitochondria are healthy or stressed. Or perhaps the luciferase is linked to mitochondrial function.",
