Therefore, a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) * a, and a2 = (M1/(M1+M2)) *a. \n\nThus, a1 + a2 = a, so the total a is the sum. \n\nBut substituting into the Kepler formula, (M1 + M2) = (a)^3 * (4\u03c0\u00b2)/(G P\u00b2). \n\nBut the radial velocity of each star is related to their orbital speed. The orbital speed v1 = (2\u03c0 a1)/P, and similarly v2 = (2\u03c0 a2)/P. \n\nSo the radial velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 are equal to v1 and v2 (assuming edge-on orbits, so sin i =1, but we can assume that the inclination is the same for both systems, so the ratio would be unaffected by sin i).",
