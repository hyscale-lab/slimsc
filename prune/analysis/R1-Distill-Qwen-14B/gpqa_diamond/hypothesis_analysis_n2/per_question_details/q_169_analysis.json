          "text1": "Wait, this is an important point. The question states that the original decay is 2A \u2192 2B + 2E + 2V, and the variant is 2A \u2192 2B + 2E + M. The Q-value is the energy released in the decay, which depends on the mass difference between the initial and final states. \n\nIn the original decay, the final state includes 2B, 2E, and 2V. In the variant, it's 2B, 2E, and M. Since M is massless, the mass of the final state in the variant is (mass of 2B) + (mass of 2E) (since E has mass, but M is massless). The original decay's final mass includes 2V, which have some mass (even if small). So the mass difference (and thus Q) would be different between the two decays.",
          "text2": "Wait, actually, the Q-value is the difference between the initial mass and the final mass. Let me compute the initial and final masses. \n\nOriginal decay: Initial mass is 2A. Final mass is 2B + 2E + 2V. Since E and V are much lighter, their rest masses are negligible compared to A and B. So Q_initial = (2A mass) - (2B mass). \n\nIn the variant decay: 2A \u2192 2B + 2E + M. Since M is massless, the final mass is 2B + 2E. Therefore the Q-value here would be (2A mass) - (2B mass + 2E mass).",
