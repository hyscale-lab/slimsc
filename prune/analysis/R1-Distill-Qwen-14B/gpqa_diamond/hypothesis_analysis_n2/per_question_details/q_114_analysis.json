          "text1": "Wait, butan-2-one plus NaCN. I think when ketones react with cyanide ions, they form cyanohydrins. Oh yeah, that's right! Cyanohydrin formation. So the cyanide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen gets a proton, leading to the formation of a secondary alcohol adjacent to the nitrile group. So the product should be 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So in this reaction, the reagent A is probably an acid, because typically, you need an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic for the nucleophilic attack by CN-.\n\nSo the first part: A is H3O+? Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3.",

Let me visualize that: the ketone (butan-2-one) has a carbonyl group. Adding CN- would give a compound with a hydroxyl and a nitrile group on the same carbon, which fits the product structure.\n\nSo the reagent A would be involved in the work-up after the nucleophilic addition.

          "text1": "Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because sometimes, the reaction can be done under basic conditions, but I think the cyanohydrin formation is typically acid-catalyzed. So yes, the first reagent A should be an acid, like H3O+ or H2SO4. So looking at the options, A could be either option A, B, or others.\n\nNow the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Hmm, okay, so the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group attached to the same carbon. When nitriles are hydrolyzed, they can form carboxylic acids under certain conditions.",
          "text2": "Wait, but what about other possibilities? Are there other conditions for cyanohydrin formation? I think sometimes it's done under basic conditions, but maybe the work-up uses acid. So for the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+.\n\nMoving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it's reacting with reagent B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.\n\nLooking at the product, the nitrile group (-CN) has been converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). So the reaction is converting a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. How does that happen?\n\nI remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. For the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, typically, it's done under strong acidic conditions, like using H2SO4 or HCl, and heat. Or under basic conditions followed by acid work-up.",
