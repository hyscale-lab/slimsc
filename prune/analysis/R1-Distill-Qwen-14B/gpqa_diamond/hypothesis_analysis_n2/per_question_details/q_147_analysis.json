          "text1": "Wait, if the antiproton is moving slowly, then the initial momentum of the system is approximately the momentum of the antiproton plus the proton's momentum. If the proton is at rest, then the initial momentum is just the antiproton's momentum. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, its momentum is small, so the total initial momentum is small. Therefore, the total momentum after annihilation must also be small. So the four particles must move in such a way that their total momentum cancels out. \n\nHmm, maybe the four particles are emitted symmetrically. Let's consider that in the center-of-mass frame, since the initial momentum is negligible, the total momentum after the collision is zero. Therefore, the four particles must have momenta that cancel each other. Since there are two positive and two negative, maybe they move in opposite directions. For example, each pair of A+ and A- could move in opposite directions, but with the same speed and direction.",
          "text2": "Alternatively, maybe the total initial momentum is zero. Like, if the proton and antiproton are moving towards each other with equal and opposite velocities, but since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the proton's velocity is also negligible? Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the initial momentum is zero. Because in many such problems, when particles annihilate, they are treated as at rest, so that the products must have zero total momentum. Let me assume that.\n\nSo, the initial energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton. Since protons and antiprotons have the same mass, that would be 2m_p c\u00b2. The mass of the proton is about 938 MeV/c\u00b2, so total energy is 2*938 \u2248 1876 MeV.\n\nThe products are 2 A+ and 2 A-. Each A has a mass of 300 MeV/c\u00b2. So total rest mass energy of the products is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. Since the total energy is 1876 MeV, which is greater than 1200, the excess energy must be kinetic energy of the particles A.\n\nBut since the problem is asking for their velocity, perhaps we can assume they are moving at relativistic speeds. Because their kinetic energy is significant. Let me think about how to calculate the velocity.\n\nSince the total momentum must be zero, the four-momenta of the particles must add to the initial four-momentum. Let me consider that.\n\nThe initial four-momentum is (E_initial, 0), since we assumed momentum is zero. The final state has four particles, each with energy E_A and momentum p_A. Since the total momentum must be zero, their momenta must cancel out. Since there are two positive and two negative charges, perhaps they are emitted in opposite directions. For example, two moving in one direction and two in the opposite. But to get total momentum zero, the momentum vectors must sum to zero. Let's consider that each A+ and A- pair have opposite momenta.

          "text2": "Wait, actually, the total energy must equal the initial energy. Since the particles are created from the annihilation, their total energy (including rest mass) must equal the initial energy. So let's think in terms of conservation of energy. Let me formalize this.\n\nThe initial particles are a proton and antiproton. Their rest mass energy is each 938 MeV, so total 2*938 = 1876 MeV. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is negligible, so the total initial energy is just the sum of their rest masses, so 1876 MeV. \n\nAfter annihilation, we have four particles: two A+ and two A-. Each has rest mass m_A c\u00b2 = 300 MeV. So the total rest mass energy of the four particles is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. The remaining energy (1876 - 1200) = 676 MeV must be the total kinetic energy of these four particles. \n\nBut to find the velocity of particle A, I think we need to consider the kinetic energy of each particle. But since the particles are produced in pairs, perhaps they move symmetrically. Also, the system's total momentum must be conserved. Since the initial momentum is the antiproton's momentum, but if it's moving slowly, the initial momentum is negligible.",
