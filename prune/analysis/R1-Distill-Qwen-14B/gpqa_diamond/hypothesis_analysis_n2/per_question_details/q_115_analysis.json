Let me think.\n\nThe electron's total energy is 4mc\u00b2, and its rest mass is mc\u00b2, so the kinetic energy is 3mc\u00b2. The momentum can be calculated via E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (mc\u00b2)^2. Let me compute the momentum for the electron first.\n\nFor the electron: E_e = 4mc\u00b2. Then, (E_e)^2 = (p_e c)^2 + (mc\u00b2)^2. So, (p_e c)^2 = (4mc\u00b2)^2 - (mc\u00b2)^2 = 16 m\u00b2 c^4 - m\u00b2c^4 = 15 m\u00b2c^4. Therefore, p_e c = sqrt(15) m c\u00b2. So p_e = sqrt(15) m c. \n\nSimilarly for the positron, which has E_p = 2mc\u00b2. Then, (2mc\u00b2)^2 = (p_p c)^2 + (mc\u00b2)^2. So (p_p c)^2 = 4m\u00b2c^4 - m\u00b2c^4 = 3m\u00b2c^4, so p_p = sqrt(3) m c.\n\nNow, the momentum vectors before collision: the electron's momentum is along +x: p_e_x = sqrt(15) m c, and the positron's is along -x: p_p_x = - sqrt(3) m c (since direction is opposite). The total momentum before collision is p_total_x = sqrt(15) m c - sqrt(3) m c.",
          "text2": "Alternatively, since energy and momentum are related by E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (m c\u00b2)^2. For the electron, E_e\u00b2 = (P_e c)^2 + (m_e c\u00b2)^2. So (4 m_e c\u00b2)^2 = (P_e c)^2 + (m_e c\u00b2)^2. Solving for P_e:\n\n(16 m_e\u00b2 c^4) = (P_e c)^2 + m_e\u00b2 c^4 \u2192 (P_e c)^2 = 15 m_e\u00b2 c^4 \u2192 P_e = sqrt(15) m_e c. \n\nSimilarly for the positron: (2 m_e c\u00b2)^2 = (P_p c)^2 + (m_e c\u00b2)^2 \u2192 4 m_e\u00b2c^4 = (P_p c)^2 + m_e\u00b2c^4 \u2192 (P_p c)^2 = 3 m_e\u00b2c^4 \u2192 P_p = sqrt(3) m_e c. \n\nTherefore, the total momentum before collision is P_total = P_e (electron's direction) minus P_p (since positron is opposite). Let me confirm directions: if electron is moving +x, then P_e is +sqrt(15)m_e c. The positron's momentum is in -x direction, so P_p is -sqrt(3)m_e c. So total momentum is sqrt(15)m_e c - sqrt(3)m_e c.",
