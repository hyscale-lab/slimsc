So if a1 is smaller than a2, then P1 is larger.\n\nSo in our case, a1 is about 0.6 a2, so P1 is about 1.65 times P2.\n\nSo the probability for Planet_1 is higher than that of Planet_2.\n\nSo the researchers should prefer Planet_1 for observation because it has a higher transit probability.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.\n\nOption D says 2.7 times, which is way higher than our calculation.",
