The ethynyl group in ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne (HC\u2261C-Cyclohexane). The NaNH2 would deprotonate the alkyne's acidic proton (the terminal H), forming the acetylide (C\u2261C-Cyclohexane^-). Then, reacting with methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate the acetylide, leading to CH2CH2-Cyclohexane?",

Then, if we add an alkyl halide like methyl chloride, that would alkylate the acetylide. So the first step would be using NaNH2 and methyl chloride to make a propargyl group? Let me think.\n\nEthynylcyclohexane is cyclohexylacetylene. If you deprotonate the acetylene proton with NaNH2, you get a carbanion.
