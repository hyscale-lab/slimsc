          "text1": "Wait, but what about the fact that in classical E&M, when you have point particles, like electrons, you get issues with infinite charge density. So to model this, you might have to use a regularization, like assuming a small radius for the charge. But that's a classical approach, not the same as regularization in QFT. So in the context of the question, which is about the theories themselves, perhaps the classical theory doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory. Or perhaps the way the question is phrased refers to whether the theory itself is free of divergences, regardless of how you model point charges.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about each option.\n\nOption A: Superstring theory. It's a quantum theory that doesn't require renormalization because it's finite. So it doesn't need regularization.\n\nOption D: Classical Electrodynamics. Since it's a classical theory, it doesn't use regularization in the quantum sense. But it does have infinities (like point charges), but those are handled differently, not via regularization methods.\n\nSo in that case, the theory that never requires regularization would be option D: Classical Electrodynamics.",
          "text2": "Alternatively, in a theory without point particles, perhaps the divergences are absent, so no regularization is needed.\n\nSo which theories don't require regularization? I think that in superstring theory, the perturbation theory's loop expansions (as string loops) don't lead to the same kind of divergences because of the extended nature of the objects. So maybe superstring theory doesn't require regularization, making option A the correct answer.",
