Since probabilities are calculated as the square of the coefficients in the normalized state, maybe I need to first normalize the given vector. Let me do that.

Hmm, that's important because probabilities depend on that.\n\nNow, the problem says, if we first measure P and then Q, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and then -1 for Q. To find this, we need to consider the process: first, measuring P, which will project the system into an eigenstate of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, then measuring Q.
