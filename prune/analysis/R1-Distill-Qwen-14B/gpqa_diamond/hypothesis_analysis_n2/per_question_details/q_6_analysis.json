          "text1": "Wait, but the first term is (1/2)k (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Adding the second term gives (1/2k x\u00b2 + 1/2k y\u00b2) + 3/2k x\u00b2 = so combining the x terms: (1/2 + 3/2)k x\u00b2 = 2k x\u00b2, plus (1/2)k y\u00b2. So the potential becomes V(x,y) = 2k x\u00b2 + (1/2)k y\u00b2. \n\nOh, so that's a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with different spring constants along x and y directions. The harmonic oscillator in 2D with potential V(x,y) = (1/2)m\u03c9_x\u00b2 x\u00b2 + (1/2)m\u03c9_y\u00b2 y\u00b2 has energy levels (n_x + 1/2)\u0127\u03c9_x + (n_y + 1/2)\u0127\u03c9_y. \n\nBut here, the potential is V = 2k x\u00b2 + (k/2)y\u00b2.

So (1/2)m\u03c9_x\u00b2 = 2k \u2192 \u03c9_x\u00b2 = (4k)/m \u2192 \u03c9_x = 2 sqrt(k/m). \n\nSimilarly, for the y-direction term, it's (1/2)k y\u00b2. Comparing to (1/2)m\u03c9_y\u00b2 y\u00b2, we have (1/2)m\u03c9_y\u00b2 = (1/2)k \u2192 \u03c9_y\u00b2 = k/m \u2192 \u03c9_y = sqrt(k/m).\n\nTherefore, the energy levels would be for each direction:\n\nE = \u0127\u03c9_x (n_x + 1/2) + \u0127\u03c9_y (n_y + 1/2)\n\nSubstituting \u03c9_x and \u03c9_y:\n\nE = \u0127*(2 sqrt(k/m))*(n_x + 1/2) + \u0127*(sqrt(k/m))*(n_y + 1/2)\n\nLet me factor out \u0127*sqrt(k/m):\n\nE = \u0127*sqrt(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ]\n\nExpanding inside the brackets:\n\n2n_x + 1 + n_y + 0.5 = 2n_x + n_y + 1.5\n\nSo the total energy is E = \u0127\u221a(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )\n\nLooking at the options, let's check:\n\nOption C says (2n_x +n_y + 3/2) \u210f sqrt(k/m).

Let me set that equal to the standard form. So, comparing terms: \n\nThe standard form is (1/2)m\u03c9_x\u00b2 x\u00b2 for the x-direction. Here, the coefficient of x\u00b2 is 2k. So (1/2)m\u03c9_x\u00b2 = 2k \u2192 \u03c9_x\u00b2 = (4k)/m \u2192 \u03c9_x = 2 sqrt(k/m). \n\nSimilarly, for the y-direction term, it's (1/2)k y\u00b2. Comparing to (1/2)m\u03c9_y\u00b2 y\u00b2, we have (1/2)m\u03c9_y\u00b2 = (1/2)k \u2192 \u03c9_y\u00b2 = k/m \u2192 \u03c9_y = sqrt(k/m).\n\nTherefore, the energy levels would be for each direction:\n\nE = \u0127\u03c9_x (n_x + 1/2) + \u0127\u03c9_y (n_y + 1/2)\n\nSubstituting \u03c9_x and \u03c9_y:\n\nE = \u0127*(2 sqrt(k/m))*(n_x + 1/2) + \u0127*(sqrt(k/m))*(n_y + 1/2)\n\nLet me factor out \u0127*sqrt(k/m):\n\nE = \u0127*sqrt(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ]\n\nExpanding inside the brackets:\n\n2n_x + 1 + n_y + 0.5 = 2n_x + n_y + 1.5\n\nSo the total energy is E = \u0127\u221a(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )\n\nLooking at the options, let's check:\n\nOption C says (2n_x +n_y + 3/2) \u210f sqrt(k/m). That's exactly what I have here.",
          "text2": "Wait, that simplifies. Let me compute each term:\n\nFirst term is (1/2)k(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). The second term is (3/2)k (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) * (x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)) which simplifies to (3/2)k x\u00b2. So altogether, the potential becomes (1/2)k(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + (3/2)k x\u00b2. Combining those terms, the x\u00b2 terms are (1/2 + 3/2)k x\u00b2 = 2k x\u00b2, and the y\u00b2 term is (1/2)k y\u00b2. So the total potential V(x,y) = 2k x\u00b2 + (1/2)k y\u00b2. \n\nOh, wait! So in Cartesian coordinates, the potential splits into a harmonic oscillator in the x-direction with spring constant 2k, and another harmonic oscillator in the y-direction with spring constant (1/2)k. Since the potential is separable in Cartesian coordinates, the wavefunctions and energies should also be separable. \n\nTherefore, the energy levels for each direction can be considered independently. The energy of a 1D harmonic oscillator is (n + 1/2) \u210f\u03c9, where \u03c9 = sqrt(k/m). \n\nSo for the x-direction: the spring constant is 2k, so the angular frequency \u03c9_x = sqrt( (2k)/m ). Similarly, the y-direction's spring constant is (1/2)k, so \u03c9_y = sqrt( ( (1/2)k ) / m ) = sqrt(k/(2m)).\n\nTherefore, the energy contributions from each direction are:\n\nE_x = (n_x + 1/2) \u210f \u03c9_x = (n_x + 1/2) \u210f sqrt(2k/m)\n\nE_y = (n_y + 1/2) \u210f \u03c9_y = (n_y + 1/2) \u210f sqrt( k/(2m) )\n\nThe total energy is the sum of E_x and E_y.
