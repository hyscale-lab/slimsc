          "text1": "But wait, in this case, the star has spots. The spots are cooler, so when they rotate into view, the brightness changes because the spots are darker than the surrounding. So when the spots are on the visible side, the star appears a bit dimmer.\n\nSo the star's brightness variation due to the spots is due to the spots being cooler. So the question is: what's the change in brightness when the spots rotate in and out of view, and how does that compare to the change caused by a planet blocking the star's light.\n\nLet me break it down.\n\nFirst, the star's light without spots: the flux is uniform. But when the spots are visible, their lower flux causes a dip in the total observed flux.\n\nThe star has a radius Rstar = Sun's radius. Let's say Rstar = R_sun for simplicity.\n\nThe spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So, let's think about the area. A hemisphere is 2\u03c0 R\u00b2, and 20% of that is 0.2 * 2\u03c0 R\u00b2 = 0.4 \u03c0 R\u00b2. So the area of the spots is 0.4 \u03c0 R\u00b2.",
          "text2": "Wait a second, the question says that the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So the photometric variations would look similar. So when the spots are on the side facing us, the star appears dimmer. As the star rotates, the spots come into view or go away, causing a dip similar to a transit.\n\nBut the question is to find the radius of a hypothetical planet that would cause the same amplitude in the light curve as these spots. So we need to calculate the relative brightness change caused by the spots and then equate that to the transit dip from a planet, then solve for the planet's radius.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the change in brightness due to the spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots are 1000 K cooler, so their temperature is 5000 K. The flux from the star without spots is based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4\u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3Teff\u2074. But the spots emit less flux.\n\nThe filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere.",
