The pp-III branch produces neutrinos at certain energies, particularly higher energies perhaps. If the pp-III stops, that source of high-energy neutrinos stops, so the flux in certain energy bands would decrease.\n\nBut what's the typical energy of neutrinos from the pp-III branch? The proton-proton chain primarily produces neutrinos with energies around a few tens of keV.",
          "text2": "Wait, the pp-III branch involves the reaction where two protons and a helium-3 nucleus (He-3) combine to form boron-8 (B-8). Boron-8 is unstable and decays into lithium-7 and two positrons, I think. Oh, and during that decay, I believe a neutrino is emitted. Or wait, maybe more accurately, the production of B-8 is part of the pp-III branch, and the decay of B-8 produces high-energy neutrinos. So if the pp-III stops, then those high-energy neutrinos wouldn't be produced anymore.\n\nSo the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are higher energy compared to the main pp branch. The main pp branch (like the dominant pp-I) produces lower-energy neutrinos. But how does this affect the flux in the two energy bands?\n\nThe question is about the ratio of flux in two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, let's think about what neutrino energies are produced where.\n\nIf the main pp branch (pp-I) produces lower-energy neutrinos, maybe around 200-800 keV, and the pp-III branch produces higher-energy ones, like above 800 keV or so. So when pp-III stops, the flux in higher bands would drop more.\n\nSo before the pp-III stopped, the neutrinos from both branches were contributing to the flux.
