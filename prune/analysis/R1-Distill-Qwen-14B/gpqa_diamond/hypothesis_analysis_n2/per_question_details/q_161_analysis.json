Because in electron microscopy, the electrons are the ones being shot through, and their interactions with gas molecules would determine their mean free path. \n\nAh, right. The original mean free path \u03bb1 was calculated for the gas molecules. But the problem now is about the electrons' mean free path when the electron beam is on. Because when the electron beam is operating, the electrons are moving through the gas, and their mean free path would depend on how often they collide with gas molecules. The question is, how does \u03bb2 (the electrons' mean free path) compare to \u03bb1 (the gas molecules' mean free path under vacuum)?",
