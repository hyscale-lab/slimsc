          "text1": "Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of proportionality. Since all the planets are around the same star, L is constant, so the equilibrium temperature is proportional to (1/a^(1/2)). Because the flux is inversely proportional to a squared, so T^4 is proportional to flux, so T is proportional to flux^(1/4) = (1/a\u00b2)^(1/4) = 1/a^(1/2). \n\nTherefore, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis. \n\nSo the ratio T4/T2 is (a2/a4)^(1/2). \n\nNow, I need to find the ratio between their orbital periods first. The problem states the orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has period P1 = 1 unit, Planet_2 is 2 units, P3=2.5, P4=3.5, and P5=5. \n\nWe need the ratio of their semi-major axes. But Kepler's third law says that the orbital period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed. So (P1/P2)^2 = (a1^3/a2^3). So a is proportional to P^(2/3). \n\nTherefore, the semi-major axis a is proportional to P^(2/3). \n\nTherefore, the ratio of a4 to a2 is (P4/P2)^(2/3).",
          "text2": "Alternatively, the equilibrium temperature is proportional to (Luminosity / a\u00b2)^(1/4), because the energy received per unit area is L/(4\u03c0a\u00b2), and then setting that equal to the blackbody emission \u03c3T^4. So rearranged, T is proportional to (L/(a\u00b2))^(1/4). Since L (luminosity) of the star is the same for both planets, then T is proportional to (1/a\u00b2)^(1/4) = 1/a^(0.5). So T \u221d 1/sqrt(a). \n\nTherefore, the ratio of temperatures T4 / T2 would be sqrt(a2 / a4). Because T4 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a4), and T2 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a2). So when you take the ratio T4/T2 = (1/sqrt(a4)) / (1/sqrt(a2)) ) = sqrt( a2 / a4 ). \n\nOkay, now I need to find the ratio a2/a4. But the problem gives the orbital periods. Since the planets are in circular orbits and assuming they're orbiting the same star, their orbital periods relate to their distances via Kepler's third law: P\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3. So (P4/P2)\u00b2 = (a4/a2)^3. So rearranged, (a4/a2) = (P4/P2)^(2/3), so a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3). \n\nThe given orbital period ratios are for all five planets: 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Let me see which numbers correspond to Planet_2 and Planet_4. The planets are labeled Planet_1 through Planet_5. The ratios are given as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has period 1 (unit), Planet_2 has 2, Planet_3 is 2.5, Planet_4 is 3.5, and Planet_5 is 5. \n\nTherefore, the ratio P2 / P4 is 2 / 3.5. Let me compute that. 2 divided by 3.5. Well, 3.5 is 7/2, so 2/(7/2) = 4/7 \u2248 0.571. Then (P2/P4)^(2/3) would be (4/7)^(2/3).",
