Because the particle's motion contributes (-1)^L, and its own parity is part of it. \n\nSo the total parity of the final state (NN + X) must equal the initial parity (which is +1). \n\nSo:\n\nP_initial = P_final \u2192 1 = [P_NN] * [P_X] \n\nWhere P_NN is the parity of the NN system, which is (-1)^L_NN (since their orbital angular momentum is L_NN and their intrinsic parities multiply to +1 as above). \n\nP_X is the parity of the emitted particle, which is (-1)^{L_X} * intrinsic_parity_X. Since the problem states X has intrinsic parity -1, so:\n\nP_X = (-1)^{L_X} * (-1) = - (-1)^{L_X} \n\nSo putting it together:\n\n1 = [ (-1)^L_NN ] * [ - (-1)^{L_X} ]\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n1 = - (-1)^{L_NN} * (-1)^{L_X} \n\nSo:\n\n- (-1)^{L_NN + L_X} = 1 \u2192 (-1)^{L_NN + L_X} = -1 \n\nWhich implies that L_NN + L_X must be odd. \n\nSo L_NN + L_X \u22611 mod 2. \n\nThat's one condition. \n\nNext, angular momentum conservation. The total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial state has J=0. The total angular momentum of the final state must also be 0. \n\nThe final state is the NN system plus the emitted particle X. Let me denote the angular momentum of the NN system as J_NN and that of X as J_X. \n\nThe total angular momentum J_total = J_NN + J_X must be 0. But since J_total is the vector sum, but since the problem is about partial waves, maybe we can consider that the orbital angular momentum between the NN and X must account for the total.",
          "text2": "Wait, the question says the NN system is emitting a particle X. So the initial state is NN (the bound system) and the final state is NN (in a different state) plus X. So conservation of parity would require that the parity of the initial NN must equal the product of the parities of the final NN and X. Because the total parity must be conserved. So parity_initial = parity_final. The initial parity is parity_NN_initial, and the final parity is parity_NN_final multiplied by the parity of X (since X is a particle with its own parity). \n\nSo parity_NN_initial = parity_NN_final * parity_X\n\nWe know the initial parity is for the NN system in 1S0, so L_initial is 0, so parity is (-1)^0 = 1. The emitted particle X has parity -1, so rearranged, parity_NN_final = (parity_NN_initial) / (parity_X) \u2192 1 / (-1) = -1. Therefore, the final NN state must have parity -1.\n\nThe parity of the final NN system is (-1)^{L_NN}, where L_NN is the orbital angular momentum between the two nucleons in the final state. So (-1)^{L_NN} must equal -1. Therefore, L_NN must be odd. \n\nSo that's one condition: L_NN must be odd. Let me note that.\n\nNow, the other part of the question is about the Pauli statistics condition given: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. The problem states that T(NN) (isospin) is 0 in the final NN state. So substituting that: 0 \u2261 S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Therefore, S(NN) + L(NN) must be congruent to -1 mod 2, which is the same as 1 mod 2. So S(NN) + L(NN) is odd. \n\nNow, the question is to determine which of the options is not permitted. The options give the transition from the initial 1S0 to some final state plus a particle X. Each option lists the final NN state's term symbol and the angular momentum (labeled by the letter) of particle X. The lowercase letter in the options (like p, s, f) denotes the angular momentum l of the emitted particle X. \n\nSo for each option, I need to check two things: \n\n1. Conservation of angular momentum: The total angular momentum of the initial system (which is J_initial = 0, from 1S0 state) must equal the vector sum of the final NN's angular momentum and the emitted particle's angular momentum. So J_initial = J_NN_final + L_X.",
