The acetic acid can act as an acid, so the OH- will deprotonate it. The reaction is: CH3COOH + OH- \u2192 CH3COO- + H2O. \n\nThe moles of acetic acid are 0.05 (from earlier calculation). The remaining OH- is 0.1 moles. Since the OH- is in excess here (0.1 moles vs 0.05 moles of acetic acid), it will completely neutralize all the acetic acid, and still have some OH- left over. \n\nSo, moles of OH- after reacting with acetic acid: 0.1 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- left.",
          "text2": "Wait, acetic acid is weak, so its H+ contribution is not fully dissociated. Hmm, but when it's mixed with strong base like Ba(OH)2, maybe the OH- will neutralize some of the H+ from HCl and acetic acid. But the problem here is figuring out which parts react first.\n\nSince HCl is a strong acid, it will donate all its H+ (0.08 moles). The acetic acid's H+ is weak, so maybe we can treat the H+ from HCl first. Let's see the OH- from the base is 0.18 moles. \n\nSo first, the OH- will neutralize the H+ from HCl. Let's compute that. The H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol, and OH- is 0.18 mol. The reaction between H+ and OH- gives H2O. The excess OH- will be 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- remaining.",
