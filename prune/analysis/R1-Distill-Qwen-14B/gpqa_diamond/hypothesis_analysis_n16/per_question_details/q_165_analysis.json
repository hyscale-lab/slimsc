Regular branches would require a catalyst that can insert branches during the polymerization. The Ziegler-Natta catalysts produce linear HDPE, but to get branches, maybe a different catalyst is needed. \n\nI recall that single-site catalysts, like metallocenes, can produce different structures.

If the second catalyst requires a different activator, that might be the case. \n\nStatement C mentions noble metals like Pt, Pd, etc. being too expensive. Noble metals are indeed expensive, so that could be true. \n\nNow, the question is about which of the four statements is correct. The options are A, B, C, D. \n\nFirst, the question says the scientist wants to introduce regular branches using only ethylene. Regular branches would require a catalyst that can insert branches during the polymerization. The Ziegler-Natta catalysts produce linear HDPE, but to get branches, maybe a different catalyst is needed. \n\nI recall that single-site catalysts, like metallocenes, can produce different structures. But for regular branching, maybe a combination of catalysts is used. For example, the INEOS's Borealis uses a single-site catalyst with a specific activator to make bimodal or branched structures.",
