          "text1": "But wait, both are moving in the same direction, so v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c. So v1 is faster than v2, so the relative speed from the perspective of the second astronaut (who is moving at 0.5c) would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6*0.5)c\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nLet me compute that. The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3) = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed should be around 0.14c. That rules out some options. Looking at the options, option C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's a clue.\n\nNow the second part is the total energy of the system. The total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy formula is E = gamma * m c\u00b2, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)).\n\nSo for astronaut 1: mass 2m, velocity 0.6c. Let's compute gamma for him. v\u00b2/c\u00b2 is (0.6)^2 = 0.36. So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. Then E1 = 1.25 * 2m c\u00b2 = 2.5 m c\u00b2.\n\nFor astronaut 2: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c. v\u00b2/c\u00b2 is 0.25. 1 -0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.8660, so gamma is about 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c\u00b2 = approximately 3.464 m c\u00b2.",

So in this case, since both are moving in the positive x-direction, the relative speed of the slower one from the perspective of the faster one would be (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c\u00b2)).\n\nLet me compute that. The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c\u00b2)/(c\u00b2) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c. Hmm, so looking at the options, both C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's one part done.\n\nNow for the total energy. I think each astronaut's energy should be calculated using the relativistic energy formula: E = gamma * m c\u00b2. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nSo for the first astronaut with mass 2m and speed 0.6c: Gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

Square root is about sqrt(0.75) \u2248 0.8660, so gamma is 1/0.8660 \u2248 1.1547. So the energy is 1.1547 * 3m c\u00b2 \u2248 3.464 mc\u00b2.\n\nAdding both energies: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc\u00b2.

So, from the perspective of the first astronaut (mass 2m) moving at 0.6c, the second astronaut (mass 3m) moves at what speed? Let's call u as the speed of the second astronaut in the initial frame (0.5c), and v is the observer's speed (0.6c). So the relative speed would be (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c\u00b2). So substituting the values, u=0.5c, v=0.6c.\n\nSo plugging in, (0.5c - 0.6c) is (-0.1c). Then the denominator is 1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c\u00b2) = 1 - (0.3 c\u00b2)/(c\u00b2) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3) = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed should be around 0.14c. That rules out some options.

The negative sign indicates direction, but since we're talking about speed, the magnitude is 0.1429c, which is about 0.14c. That matches option C and D for the relative speed.\n\nSo the relative speed is approximately 0.14c.\n\nNow, the total energy of the system. The total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. Each has their own gamma factor.\n\nThe relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c\u00b2. Where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nSo for astronaut A with mass 2m and v = 0.6c: gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.\n\nSo E_A = gamma_A * 2m c\u00b2 = (1.25)(2m c\u00b2) = 2.5 m c\u00b2.\n\nFor astronaut B with mass 3m and v = 0.5c: gamma_B = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) \u2248 1/0.8660 \u2248 1.1547.\n\nE_B = gamma_B * 3m c\u00b2 \u2248 1.1547 * 3 m c\u00b2 \u2248 3.464 m c\u00b2.\n\nAdding them together: E_total = 2.5 + 3.464 \u2248 5.964 m c\u00b2. So approximately 5.96 m c\u00b2.\n\nLooking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc\u00b2 and v_rel=0.14c. Option D says E=5mc\u00b2.",
          "text2": "Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. The formula is (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c^2)). So if astronaut A is moving at u = 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at v = 0.5c, then the relative speed of B as seen by A is (0.5c - 0.6c) / [1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c\u00b2)].\n\nCalculating numerator: 0.5 -0.6 = -0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c\u00b2)/c\u00b2 = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.\n\nSo the relative speed is (-0.1c)/(0.7) \u2248 -0.1428c. Oh, wait, but speed is a scalar, so magnitude is 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c. So looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So options C and D are possible.\n\nNow for the total energy. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma multiplied by mc\u00b2. So for each, calculate their gamma factors.\n\nFor astronaut 1: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

The relativistic energy formula is E = gamma * m c\u00b2, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)).\n\nSo for astronaut 1: mass 2m, velocity 0.6c. Let's compute gamma for him. v\u00b2/c\u00b2 is (0.6)^2 = 0.36. So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. Then E1 = 1.25 * 2m c\u00b2 = 2.5 m c\u00b2.\n\nFor astronaut 2: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c. v\u00b2/c\u00b2 is 0.25. 1 -0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.8660, so gamma is about 1.1547.

The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c\u00b2)/(c\u00b2) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c. Hmm, so looking at the options, both C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's one part done.\n\nNow for the total energy.

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nSo for the first astronaut with mass 2m and speed 0.6c: Gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

Looking at the options, option C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's a clue.\n\nNow the second part is the total energy of the system. The total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy formula is E = gamma * m c\u00b2, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)).\n\nSo for astronaut 1: mass 2m, velocity 0.6c. Let's compute gamma for him. v\u00b2/c\u00b2 is (0.6)^2 = 0.36. So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. Then E1 = 1.25 * 2m c\u00b2 = 2.5 m c\u00b2.\n\nFor astronaut 2: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c. v\u00b2/c\u00b2 is 0.25. 1 -0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.8660, so gamma is about 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c\u00b2 = approximately 3.464 m c\u00b2.",
          "text2": "But wait, I think that's for when one is moving at v1 and the other at v2 in the same direction. So in this case, since both are moving in the positive x-direction, the relative speed of the slower one from the perspective of the faster one would be (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c\u00b2)).\n\nLet me compute that. The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c\u00b2)/(c\u00b2) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c. Hmm, so looking at the options, both C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's one part done.\n\nNow for the total energy. I think each astronaut's energy should be calculated using the relativistic energy formula: E = gamma * m c\u00b2. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nSo for the first astronaut with mass 2m and speed 0.6c: Gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c\u00b2 = 2.5 mc\u00b2.",

I think each astronaut's energy should be calculated using the relativistic energy formula: E = gamma * m c\u00b2. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nSo for the first astronaut with mass 2m and speed 0.6c: Gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c\u00b2 = 2.5 mc\u00b2.",

So that's about 0.14c, so looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c.\n\nSo that's the relative speed part. Now for the total energy.\n\nTotal energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * mc\u00b2, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nSo for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c), gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.
