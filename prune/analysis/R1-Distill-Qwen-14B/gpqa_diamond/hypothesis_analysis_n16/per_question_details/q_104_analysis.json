The formula for K is:\n\nK = ( (2\u03c0 G)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) ) / ( ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) * (P)^(1/3) ) )\n\nBut since M_planet << M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_planet \u2248 M_star, and sin i \u2248 1 (assuming edge-on orbit, which is the case for maximum RV signal). So,\n\nK \u2248 ( (2\u03c0 G)^(1/3) * M_planet ) / ( M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )\n\nHmm, but does G have units that will give velocity when everything is plugged in? I think so, since G has units of m^3 kg^-1 s^-2.\n\nBut maybe an easier way to approach this is to consider that the velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the period, but wait, no. Let me think in terms of Kepler's third law.\n\nKepler's third law in the context of the star's motion: the star's orbit around the barycenter. The period P is the same as the planet's period.\n\nThe star's velocity K is related to the planet's orbital parameters. The formula I think is:\n\nK = (2\u03c0 a * sin i) / P\n\nWhere a is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the barycenter. Since the orbits are circular, sin i is 1.\n\nBut a is related to the planet's orbit. Specifically, the star's semi-major axis is a_star = ( (M_planet / (M_star + M_planet)) ) * a_planet \u2248 (M_planet / M_star) * a_planet, because M_planet is much smaller than M_star.\n\nSo, a_star \u2248 (M_planet / M_star) * a_planet.\n\nSubstituting back into K:\n\nK \u2248 (2\u03c0 * (M_planet / M_star) * a_planet) ) / P\n\nBut from Kepler's third law, a_planet^3 = (G (M_star + M_planet) P^2 ) / (4\u03c0\u00b2). Again, M_planet << M_star, so a_planet^3 \u2248 (G M_star P^2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nSo a_planet \u2248 [ ( G M_star P\u00b2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2) ]^(1/3)\n\nSubstituting a_planet into K:\n\nK \u2248 (2 \u03c0 (M_planet / M_star) * [ ( G M_star P\u00b2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2) ]^(1/3) ) / P\n\nSimplify this expression.\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nLet me factor out constants and variables.\n\nFirst, (G M_star P\u00b2 )^(1/3) = (G M_star)^(1/3) * P^(2/3)\n\nAnd 4 \u03c0\u00b2 is a constant. So [ (G M_star P\u00b2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2) ]^(1/3) = (G M_star )^(1/3) P^(2/3) * (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(-1/3)\n\nSo putting that back into K:\n\nK \u2248 ( 2 \u03c0 (M_planet / M_star ) * (G M_star )^(1/3) P^(2/3) * (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(-1/3) ) / P\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nK = (2 \u03c0) * (M_planet / M_star) * (G M_star )^(1/3) * P^(2/3) * (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(-1/3) / P\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\nP^(2/3) / P = P^(2/3 - 3/3) )= P^(-1/3)\n\nSo now,\n\nK = (2 \u03c0) * (M_planet / M_star) * (G M_star )^(1/3) * P^(-1/3) * (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(-1/3 )\n\nLet me combine the constants:\n\n(2 \u03c0) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/3) = (2 \u03c0) / ( (4)^(1/3) * (\u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/3) ) )\n\nSimplify each part:\n\n4^(1/3) = 2^(2/3), and \u03c0\u00b2^(1/3) = \u03c0^(2/3).\n\nSo,\n\n= (2 \u03c0) / ( 2^(2/3) \u03c0^(2/3) ) ) = 2^{1 - 2/3} } * \u03c0^{1 - 2/3} }\n\n= 2^{1/3} * \u03c0^{1/3} } = (2 * \u03c0 )^(1/3 )\n\nSo K \u2248 (2 \u03c0 )^(1/3) * (M_planet / M_star) ) * (G M_star )^(1/3) * P^(-1/3 )",

I think so, since G has units of m^3 kg^-1 s^-2.\n\nBut maybe an easier way to approach this is to consider that the velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the period, but wait, no. Let me think in terms of Kepler's third law.\n\nKepler's third law in the context of the star's motion: the star's orbit around the barycenter. The period P is the same as the planet's period.\n\nThe star's velocity K is related to the planet's orbital parameters. The formula I think is:\n\nK = (2\u03c0 a * sin i) / P\n\nWhere a is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the barycenter. Since the orbits are circular, sin i is 1.\n\nBut a is related to the planet's orbit. Specifically, the star's semi-major axis is a_star = ( (M_planet / (M_star + M_planet)) ) * a_planet \u2248 (M_planet / M_star) * a_planet, because M_planet is much smaller than M_star.\n\nSo, a_star \u2248 (M_planet / M_star) * a_planet.\n\nSubstituting back into K:\n\nK \u2248 (2\u03c0 * (M_planet / M_star) * a_planet) ) / P\n\nBut from Kepler's third law, a_planet^3 = (G (M_star + M_planet) P^2 ) / (4\u03c0\u00b2).

So [ (G M_star P\u00b2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2) ]^(1/3) = (G M_star )^(1/3) P^(2/3) * (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(-1/3)\n\nSo putting that back into K:\n\nK \u2248 ( 2 \u03c0 (M_planet / M_star ) * (G M_star )^(1/3) P^(2/3) * (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(-1/3) ) / P\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nK = (2 \u03c0) * (M_planet / M_star) * (G M_star )^(1/3) * P^(2/3) * (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(-1/3) / P\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\nP^(2/3) / P = P^(2/3 - 3/3) )= P^(-1/3)\n\nSo now,\n\nK = (2 \u03c0) * (M_planet / M_star) * (G M_star )^(1/3) * P^(-1/3) * (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(-1/3 )\n\nLet me combine the constants:\n\n(2 \u03c0) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/3) = (2 \u03c0) / ( (4)^(1/3) * (\u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/3) ) )\n\nSimplify each part:\n\n4^(1/3) = 2^(2/3), and \u03c0\u00b2^(1/3) = \u03c0^(2/3).\n\nSo,\n\n= (2 \u03c0) / ( 2^(2/3) \u03c0^(2/3) ) ) = 2^{1 - 2/3} } * \u03c0^{1 - 2/3} }\n\n= 2^{1/3} * \u03c0^{1/3} } = (2 * \u03c0 )^(1/3 )\n\nSo K \u2248 (2 \u03c0 )^(1/3) * (M_planet / M_star) ) * (G M_star )^(1/3) * P^(-1/3 )",

Let me think about Kepler's third law.\n\nKepler's third law says that (a^3) / (P^2) = G(M_*) / (4\u03c0\u00b2). So, a^3 = G M_* P\u00b2 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2).\n\nThe star's velocity in the orbit is v = (2\u03c0 a) / P. Because both the planet and star orbit the center of mass, but since the star's mass is much larger, the star's velocity is roughly (2\u03c0 a) / P.\n\nBut a comes from Kepler's law: a^3 = G M_* P\u00b2 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2), so a = [ (G M_* P\u00b2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2) ]^(1/3). Plugging into v:\n\nv = (2 \u03c0 / P) * [ (G M_* P\u00b2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSimplify this expression. Let's compute:\n\n= (2 \u03c0) / P * [ (G M_* P^2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nTake the exponents:\n\n= (2 \u03c0) / P * (G M_*)^(1/3) (P^2)^(1/3) (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(-1/3) )\n\n= (2 \u03c0) / P * (G M_*)^(1/3) P^(2/3) (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(-1/3) )\n\nCombine terms with P:\n\n1/P * P^(2/3) = P^(-1/3)\n\nSo,\n\nv = (2 \u03c0) (G M_*)^(1/3) (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(-1/3) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )\n\nLet me compute the constants:\n\n2 \u03c0 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3) = 2 \u03c0 / ( (2^2 \u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3) ) )\n\n= 2 \u03c0 / (2^(2/3) \u03c0^(2/3) )\n\n= [ 2^(1 - 2/3) ) ] * [ \u03c0^(1 - 2/3) ) ]\n\n= 2^(1/3) \u03c0^(1/3)\n\nSo,\n\nv = 2^(1/3) \u03c0^(1/3) * (G M_*)^(1/3) / P^(1/3)\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nv = [ (2 \u03c0 G M_* ) ]^(1/3) / P^(1/3 )",

So planet #2's orbital period is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So it is shorter, meaning planet #2's period is shorter. So the question is, how many times longer is planet #2\u2019s period compared to planet #1? Because if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then it's shorter, so it's not longer. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times, which would make P2 shorter. So the question is asking for P2 longer than P1, which would be 0.36 times, but that's shorter, not longer.

I think so, since G has units of m^3 kg^-1 s^-2.\n\nBut maybe an easier way to approach this is to consider that the velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the period, but wait, no. Let me think in terms of Kepler's third law.\n\nKepler's third law in the context of the star's motion: the star's orbit around the barycenter. The period P is the same as the planet's period.\n\nThe star's velocity K is related to the planet's orbital parameters. The formula I think is:\n\nK = (2\u03c0 a * sin i) / P\n\nWhere a is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the barycenter. Since the orbits are circular, sin i is 1.\n\nBut a is related to the planet's orbit. Specifically, the star's semi-major axis is a_star = ( (M_planet / (M_star + M_planet)) ) * a_planet \u2248 (M_planet / M_star) * a_planet, because M_planet is much smaller than M_star.\n\nSo, a_star \u2248 (M_planet / M_star) * a_planet.\n\nSubstituting back into K:\n\nK \u2248 (2\u03c0 * (M_planet / M_star) * a_planet) ) / P\n\nBut from Kepler's third law, a_planet^3 = (G (M_star + M_planet) P^2 ) / (4\u03c0\u00b2).

So it's shorter, not longer. So how many times longer is planet #2's period compared to planet #1's? It's about 0.36 times as long. So the answer would be ~0.36 times.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is ~0.36.",
