Let me compute Im[ e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l) ].\n\nFirst, e^{i delta_l} = cos(delta_l) + i sin(delta_l). Multiply by sin(delta_l):\n\nsin(delta_l) [cos(delta_l) + i sin(delta_l)] = sin(delta_l) cos(delta_l) + i sin^2(delta_l).\n\nTherefore, the imaginary part of each term is sin^2(delta_l). So the imaginary part of the entire sum is sum_{l} (2l+1) * sin^2(delta_l). Therefore, Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin\u00b2(delta_l).",

The formula f(\u03b8) has units of length. The formula is f(\u03b8) = (1/k) * ... so then (1/k) must have units of length, so k has units of 1/length. \n\nTo compute k, we need to take the kinetic energy E (50 MeV) and convert it into joules (or MeV to get the right units).

The relation between energy and momentum for a relativistic particle is E\u00b2 = p\u00b2c\u00b2 + m\u00b2c^4.

But let's do the exact calculation.\n\nThe energy E is given as 50 MeV. The rest mass energy of electron is 0.511 MeV. So the total energy is 50 MeV. So total energy squared is (50 MeV)^2 = p\u00b2c\u00b2 + (0.511 MeV)^2. Since 50 >>0.511, we can approximate p \u2248 E/c. But let's do it properly.\n\nLet me compute p in MeV/c units.
