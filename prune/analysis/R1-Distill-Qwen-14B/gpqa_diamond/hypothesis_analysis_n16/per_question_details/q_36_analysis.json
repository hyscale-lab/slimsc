The rotational energy levels for a diatomic molecule like H2 are given by (B J(J+1)), where B is the rotational constant. The energy levels are in the millikelvin range, so the energy differences would be very small. The spacing between adjacent levels (like J to J+1) is proportional to (J+1) - J = 1, so the spacing is roughly proportional to B*(2J+1). \n\nThe rotational constant B for H2 is about 60.8 GHz (for the ground vibrational state). The energy of the transition from J to J+1 is approximately 2B (times the speed of light, but maybe in terms of frequency?), so converting frequency to energy: E = h\u03bd. \n\n60.8 GHz is 60.8e9 Hz. Planck's constant h is 4.135667696e-15 eV\u00b7s. So E = 60.8e9 * 4.135667696e-15 eV \u2248 60.8e9 * 4.135e-15 \u2248 2.51e-5 eV.",
