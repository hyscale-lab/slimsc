Also, if the star is larger (larger R_s), the probability increases because R_s is in the denominator.",

So a^3 = (G M* P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2). So a is proportional to [ (M* P\u00b2) ]^(1/3). \n\nBut in this problem, Planet_1 has a shorter period. Its period is P1 = P2/3. And the mass of its star, M1 = 2 M2. So let's compute a for each.\n\nFor Planet_1:\na1^3 = (G M1 (P1)^2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)\n= (G * 2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)\n= (2 M2 * P2\u00b2) / (9 * 4 \u03c0\u00b2) ) * G\nWhich simplifies to a1^3 = (2/9) * (M2 P2\u00b2) * G/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) \n\nBut for Planet_2:\na2^3 = (G M2 P2\u00b2) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)\n\nSo a1^3 = (2/9) * a2^3, because a2^3 is (G M2 P2\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2). So a1 = [ (2/9) )^(1/3) ] * a2.\n\nLet me compute (2/9)^(1/3). 9 is 3\u00b2, so 2/9 is (2)/(3\u00b2). The cube root of that is (2^(1/3)) / 3^(2/3). Let me approximate that. 2^(1/3) is about 1.26, 3^(2/3) is about 2.08. So 1.26 / 2.08 \u2248 0.606. So a1 \u2248 0.606 * a2.\n\nSo the orbital distance a of Planet_1 is about 0.606 times that of Planet_2. \n\nNow, the transit probability P is (R* / a)^2. Both stars have the same radius, R* is the same for both. So P1 = (R* / a1)^2 and P2 = (R* / a2)^2.\n\nSo the ratio of probabilities P1/P2 is (a2/a1)^2.
