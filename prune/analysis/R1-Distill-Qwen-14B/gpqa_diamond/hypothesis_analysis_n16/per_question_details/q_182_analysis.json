          "text1": "Wait, perhaps the key point is that in the SCLC regime, the current is space-charge limited, so that the drift current is the main component, but the equation might assume that the diffusion current is negligible. Let me think. The Mott-Gurney equation applies when the current is limited by the space charge, so the dominant current is due to the drift of carriers under the electric field, but diffusion might not be considered here.",
