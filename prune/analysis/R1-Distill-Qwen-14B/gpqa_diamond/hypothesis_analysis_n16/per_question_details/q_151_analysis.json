That's interesting. So determinant is zero, so one of the eigenvalues is zero, which we already found. Since trace is zero, the sum of eigenvalues is zero, so the other two eigenvalues must be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. Let me denote them as a and -a. So eigenvalues are 0, a, -a. Then the determinant is 0*a*(-a) =0, which matches.\n\nNow, let's try to find the other eigenvalues. Let's consider the eigenvectors.\n\nWe found that (1,0,-1) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0. Let's see another possible eigenvector.\n\nSuppose we look for a vector in the direction (1, something, 1). Let me try (1, c, 1). Let's see if that can be an eigenvector.\n\nApplying P to this vector:\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)c + 0*1 = (c)/\u221a2\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*1 +0*c + (1/\u221a2)*1 = (1/\u221a2 +1/\u221a2)= \u221a2\n\nThird component:0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*c +0*1 = (c)/\u221a2\n\nSo the resulting vector is ( c/\u221a2, \u221a2, c/\u221a2 )\n\nIf this is to be an eigenvector, then this should be proportional to (1, c,1).\n\nSo setting up equations:\n\nc/\u221a2 = \u03bb *1\n\n\u221a2 = \u03bb *c\n\nc/\u221a2 = \u03bb *1\n\nFrom first and third equations, they are the same. So from first equation, \u03bb = c/\u221a2. Then substituting into second equation:\n\n\u221a2 = (c/\u221a2)*c \u2192 \u221a2 = c\u00b2 / \u221a2 \u2192 \u221a2 * \u221a2 = c\u00b2 \u2192 2 = c\u00b2 \u2192 c = \u00b1\u221a2.\n\nLet me take c = \u221a2. Then \u03bb becomes ( \u221a2 ) / \u221a2 =1.\n\nSo then, the vector (1, \u221a2, 1) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1.\n\nSimilarly, if c = -\u221a2, then \u03bb would be -1, so the vector (1, -\u221a2, 1) would be an eigenvector with eigenvalue -1.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0. So the possible outcomes when measuring P are -1, 0, and 1.\n\nSo now, to find the probability of measuring 0, we need to find the component of the state vector in the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0.\n\nThe eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 are those vectors v such that Pv =0v. We found one such vector (1,0,-1). Are there others? Let's check the dimension of the eigenspace.\n\nThe matrix P has determinant zero, so the nullspace (eigenspace for eigenvalue 0) has dimension at least 1. Let me see if the rank is 2, so the nullspace is dimension 1. Let's see, the rank of P. The first and third rows are the same (transposed?), but let me see:\n\nOriginal matrix rows:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nSo rows 1 and 3 are the same. So the rank is at most 2. Since determinant is zero, the rank is less than 3, so rank 2, so nullspace is dimension 1. So the eigenspace for 0 is 1-dimensional, spanned by (1,0,-1).",
          "text2": "Wait, the minor for element (1,2) would be the matrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 2.

So rows 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.\n\nTherefore the minor is:\n\nRow 2 (columns 1 and 3): 1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow 3 (columns 1 and 3): 0, 0\n\nSo determinant of that minor is (1/\u221a2 * 0) - (1/\u221a2 * 0) = 0. \n\nTherefore, the determinant of P is 0 * ... - (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0 * ... = 0. \n\nSo determinant is zero, so 0 is indeed an eigenvalue of P. Good.\n\nNow, the next step is to find the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Let's do that. We need to solve (P - 0I)v = 0, so Pv = 0.\n\nLet me write the equations:\n\nFirst row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u21d2 (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u21d2 v2 =0\n\nSecond row: (1/\u221a2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 =0 \u21d2 (v1 + v3)/\u221a2 = 0 \u21d2 v1 + v3 =0\n\nThird row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)*v2 + 0*v3 =0 \u21d2 same as first equation, so v2=0.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nv2 =0,\n\nv1 + v3 =0,\n\nand v2=0 (redundant).\n\nSo the eigenvectors are vectors (v1, 0, v3) with v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenspace for eigenvalue 0 is the set of vectors of the form (a, 0, -a) where a is any real number.

That's interesting. So determinant is zero, so one of the eigenvalues is zero, which we already found. Since trace is zero, the sum of eigenvalues is zero, so the other two eigenvalues must be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. Let me denote them as a and -a. So eigenvalues are 0, a, -a. Then the determinant is 0*a*(-a) =0, which matches.\n\nNow, let's try to find the other eigenvalues. Let's consider the eigenvectors.\n\nWe found that (1,0,-1) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0. Let's see another possible eigenvector.\n\nSuppose we look for a vector in the direction (1, something, 1). Let me try (1, c, 1). Let's see if that can be an eigenvector.\n\nApplying P to this vector:\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)c + 0*1 = (c)/\u221a2\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*1 +0*c + (1/\u221a2)*1 = (1/\u221a2 +1/\u221a2)= \u221a2\n\nThird component:0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*c +0*1 = (c)/\u221a2\n\nSo the resulting vector is ( c/\u221a2, \u221a2, c/\u221a2 )\n\nIf this is to be an eigenvector, then this should be proportional to (1, c,1).\n\nSo setting up equations:\n\nc/\u221a2 = \u03bb *1\n\n\u221a2 = \u03bb *c\n\nc/\u221a2 = \u03bb *1\n\nFrom first and third equations, they are the same. So from first equation, \u03bb = c/\u221a2. Then substituting into second equation:\n\n\u221a2 = (c/\u221a2)*c \u2192 \u221a2 = c\u00b2 / \u221a2 \u2192 \u221a2 * \u221a2 = c\u00b2 \u2192 2 = c\u00b2 \u2192 c = \u00b1\u221a2.\n\nLet me take c = \u221a2. Then \u03bb becomes ( \u221a2 ) / \u221a2 =1.\n\nSo then, the vector (1, \u221a2, 1) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1.\n\nSimilarly, if c = -\u221a2, then \u03bb would be -1, so the vector (1, -\u221a2, 1) would be an eigenvector with eigenvalue -1.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0. So the possible outcomes when measuring P are -1, 0, and 1.\n\nSo now, to find the probability of measuring 0, we need to find the component of the state vector in the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0.\n\nThe eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 are those vectors v such that Pv =0v. We found one such vector (1,0,-1). Are there others? Let's check the dimension of the eigenspace.\n\nThe matrix P has determinant zero, so the nullspace (eigenspace for eigenvalue 0) has dimension at least 1. Let me see if the rank is 2, so the nullspace is dimension 1. Let's see, the rank of P. The first and third rows are the same (transposed?), but let me see:\n\nOriginal matrix rows:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nSo rows 1 and 3 are the same. So the rank is at most 2. Since determinant is zero, the rank is less than 3, so rank 2, so nullspace is dimension 1. So the eigenspace for 0 is 1-dimensional, spanned by (1,0,-1).",
          "text2": "Wait, the minor for element (1,2) would be the matrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 2.

So rows 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.\n\nTherefore the minor is:\n\nRow 2 (columns 1 and 3): 1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow 3 (columns 1 and 3): 0, 0\n\nSo determinant of that minor is (1/\u221a2 * 0) - (1/\u221a2 * 0) = 0. \n\nTherefore, the determinant of P is 0 * ... - (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0 * ... = 0. \n\nSo determinant is zero, so 0 is indeed an eigenvalue of P. Good.\n\nNow, the next step is to find the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Let's do that. We need to solve (P - 0I)v = 0, so Pv = 0.\n\nLet me write the equations:\n\nFirst row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u21d2 (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u21d2 v2 =0\n\nSecond row: (1/\u221a2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 =0 \u21d2 (v1 + v3)/\u221a2 = 0 \u21d2 v1 + v3 =0\n\nThird row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)*v2 + 0*v3 =0 \u21d2 same as first equation, so v2=0.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nv2 =0,\n\nv1 + v3 =0,\n\nand v2=0 (redundant).\n\nSo the eigenvectors are vectors (v1, 0, v3) with v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenspace for eigenvalue 0 is the set of vectors of the form (a, 0, -a) where a is any real number.

Let's plug into P:\n\nP*(a,0,-a)^T:\n\nFirst component: 0*a + (1/\u221a2)*0 +0*(-a) =0.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*a +0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(-a) = (a/\u221a2) - (a/\u221a2) = 0.\n\nThird component: 0*a + (1/\u221a2)*0 +0*(-a)=0.\n\nYes, so that's correct. So the eigenvector is any scalar multiple of (1,0,-1). Let's normalize it. The norm of (1,0,-1) is sqrt(1\u00b2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the unit eigenvector is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2).\n\nSo the projection of the state vector onto this eigenvector is the inner product of the state vector and the eigenvector, then squared.\n\nThe state vector is given as the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Let's write that as a vector: v = (-1, 2, 1).\n\nThe projection onto the eigenvector u = (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2) is:\n\n\u27e8v | u\u27e9 = (-1)(1/\u221a2) + 2*0 + 1*(-1/\u221a2) = [ -1/\u221a2 -1/\u221a2 ] = -2/\u221a2 = -\u221a2.\n\nThe absolute square of this is (\u221a2)^2 = 2.",

Then \u03bb becomes ( \u221a2 ) / \u221a2 =1.\n\nSo then, the vector (1, \u221a2, 1) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1.\n\nSimilarly, if c = -\u221a2, then \u03bb would be -1, so the vector (1, -\u221a2, 1) would be an eigenvector with eigenvalue -1.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0. So the possible outcomes when measuring P are -1, 0, and 1.\n\nSo now, to find the probability of measuring 0, we need to find the component of the state vector in the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0.\n\nThe eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 are those vectors v such that Pv =0v. We found one such vector (1,0,-1). Are there others? Let's check the dimension of the eigenspace.\n\nThe matrix P has determinant zero, so the nullspace (eigenspace for eigenvalue 0) has dimension at least 1. Let me see if the rank is 2, so the nullspace is dimension 1. Let's see, the rank of P. The first and third rows are the same (transposed?), but let me see:\n\nOriginal matrix rows:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nSo rows 1 and 3 are the same. So the rank is at most 2. Since determinant is zero, the rank is less than 3, so rank 2, so nullspace is dimension 1. So the eigenspace for 0 is 1-dimensional, spanned by (1,0,-1).",
          "text2": "Wait, the minor for element (1,2) would be the matrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 2. Let me see:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\nRow 1: columns 1,2,3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow 3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nSo the minor for (1,2) is the submatrix without row 1 and column 2. So rows 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.\n\nTherefore the minor is:\n\nRow 2 (columns 1 and 3): 1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow 3 (columns 1 and 3): 0, 0\n\nSo determinant of that minor is (1/\u221a2 * 0) - (1/\u221a2 * 0) = 0. \n\nTherefore, the determinant of P is 0 * ... - (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0 * ... = 0. \n\nSo determinant is zero, so 0 is indeed an eigenvalue of P. Good.\n\nNow, the next step is to find the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Let's do that. We need to solve (P - 0I)v = 0, so Pv = 0.\n\nLet me write the equations:\n\nFirst row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u21d2 (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u21d2 v2 =0\n\nSecond row: (1/\u221a2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 =0 \u21d2 (v1 + v3)/\u221a2 = 0 \u21d2 v1 + v3 =0\n\nThird row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)*v2 + 0*v3 =0 \u21d2 same as first equation, so v2=0.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nv2 =0,\n\nv1 + v3 =0,\n\nand v2=0 (redundant).\n\nSo the eigenvectors are vectors (v1, 0, v3) with v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenspace for eigenvalue 0 is the set of vectors of the form (a, 0, -a) where a is any real number. So the eigenvectors are scalar multiples of (1,0,-1).",

That's interesting. So determinant is zero, so one of the eigenvalues is zero, which we already found. Since trace is zero, the sum of eigenvalues is zero, so the other two eigenvalues must be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. Let me denote them as a and -a. So eigenvalues are 0, a, -a. Then the determinant is 0*a*(-a) =0, which matches.\n\nNow, let's try to find the other eigenvalues. Let's consider the eigenvectors.\n\nWe found that (1,0,-1) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0. Let's see another possible eigenvector.\n\nSuppose we look for a vector in the direction (1, something, 1). Let me try (1, c, 1). Let's see if that can be an eigenvector.\n\nApplying P to this vector:\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)c + 0*1 = (c)/\u221a2\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*1 +0*c + (1/\u221a2)*1 = (1/\u221a2 +1/\u221a2)= \u221a2\n\nThird component:0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*c +0*1 = (c)/\u221a2\n\nSo the resulting vector is ( c/\u221a2, \u221a2, c/\u221a2 )\n\nIf this is to be an eigenvector, then this should be proportional to (1, c,1).\n\nSo setting up equations:\n\nc/\u221a2 = \u03bb *1\n\n\u221a2 = \u03bb *c\n\nc/\u221a2 = \u03bb *1\n\nFrom first and third equations, they are the same. So from first equation, \u03bb = c/\u221a2. Then substituting into second equation:\n\n\u221a2 = (c/\u221a2)*c \u2192 \u221a2 = c\u00b2 / \u221a2 \u2192 \u221a2 * \u221a2 = c\u00b2 \u2192 2 = c\u00b2 \u2192 c = \u00b1\u221a2.\n\nLet me take c = \u221a2. Then \u03bb becomes ( \u221a2 ) / \u221a2 =1.\n\nSo then, the vector (1, \u221a2, 1) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1.\n\nSimilarly, if c = -\u221a2, then \u03bb would be -1, so the vector (1, -\u221a2, 1) would be an eigenvector with eigenvalue -1.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0. So the possible outcomes when measuring P are -1, 0, and 1.\n\nSo now, to find the probability of measuring 0, we need to find the component of the state vector in the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0.\n\nThe eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 are those vectors v such that Pv =0v. We found one such vector (1,0,-1). Are there others? Let's check the dimension of the eigenspace.\n\nThe matrix P has determinant zero, so the nullspace (eigenspace for eigenvalue 0) has dimension at least 1. Let me see if the rank is 2, so the nullspace is dimension 1. Let's see, the rank of P. The first and third rows are the same (transposed?), but let me see:\n\nOriginal matrix rows:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nSo rows 1 and 3 are the same. So the rank is at most 2. Since determinant is zero, the rank is less than 3, so rank 2, so nullspace is dimension 1. So the eigenspace for 0 is 1-dimensional, spanned by (1,0,-1).",
          "text2": "Wait, the minor for element (1,2) would be the matrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 2.

So rows 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.\n\nTherefore the minor is:\n\nRow 2 (columns 1 and 3): 1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow 3 (columns 1 and 3): 0, 0\n\nSo determinant of that minor is (1/\u221a2 * 0) - (1/\u221a2 * 0) = 0. \n\nTherefore, the determinant of P is 0 * ... - (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0 * ... = 0. \n\nSo determinant is zero, so 0 is indeed an eigenvalue of P. Good.\n\nNow, the next step is to find the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Let's do that. We need to solve (P - 0I)v = 0, so Pv = 0.\n\nLet me write the equations:\n\nFirst row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u21d2 (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u21d2 v2 =0\n\nSecond row: (1/\u221a2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 =0 \u21d2 (v1 + v3)/\u221a2 = 0 \u21d2 v1 + v3 =0\n\nThird row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)*v2 + 0*v3 =0 \u21d2 same as first equation, so v2=0.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nv2 =0,\n\nv1 + v3 =0,\n\nand v2=0 (redundant).\n\nSo the eigenvectors are vectors (v1, 0, v3) with v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenspace for eigenvalue 0 is the set of vectors of the form (a, 0, -a) where a is any real number.

Similarly, any multiple of this vector is also an eigenvector.\n\nTherefore, the eigenspace for eigenvalue 0 is the span of (1,0,-1).\n\nSo the probability that the system is in this eigenspace is the squared modulus of the inner product of the state with this eigenvector (normalized), summed over all basis vectors in the eigenspace. Since it's one-dimensional, just the square of the inner product with the normalized eigenvector.\n\nBut first, we need to normalize the eigenvector. The vector (1,0,-1) has length sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2)=sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2).\n\nThe given state vector is |\u03c8> = (-1, 2, 1)^T, but we need to normalize it. The norm squared is 6, so the normalized state is (1/\u221a6)(-1, 2, 1).\n\nNow, the inner product between the normalized state and the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n(1/\u221a6)(-1, 2, 1) \u2022 (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2)",
          "text2": "Alternatively, the probability is the squared norm of the projection of the state vector onto the eigenspace of 0. Since the eigenspace is one-dimensional (as per earlier), the projection is onto the eigenvector corresponding to 0. \n\nThe eigenvector for 0 is (1,0,-1) as we found earlier (since v2=0, v1 = -v3). Let me confirm that. Let me take a vector (a, 0, -a). Let's plug into P:\n\nP*(a,0,-a)^T:\n\nFirst component: 0*a + (1/\u221a2)*0 +0*(-a) =0.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*a +0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(-a) = (a/\u221a2) - (a/\u221a2) = 0.\n\nThird component: 0*a + (1/\u221a2)*0 +0*(-a)=0.\n\nYes, so that's correct. So the eigenvector is any scalar multiple of (1,0,-1). Let's normalize it. The norm of (1,0,-1) is sqrt(1\u00b2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the unit eigenvector is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2).\n\nSo the projection of the state vector onto this eigenvector is the inner product of the state vector and the eigenvector, then squared.\n\nThe state vector is given as the column matrix (-1, 2, 1).

That's interesting. So determinant is zero, so one of the eigenvalues is zero, which we already found. Since trace is zero, the sum of eigenvalues is zero, so the other two eigenvalues must be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. Let me denote them as a and -a. So eigenvalues are 0, a, -a. Then the determinant is 0*a*(-a) =0, which matches.\n\nNow, let's try to find the other eigenvalues. Let's consider the eigenvectors.\n\nWe found that (1,0,-1) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0. Let's see another possible eigenvector.\n\nSuppose we look for a vector in the direction (1, something, 1). Let me try (1, c, 1). Let's see if that can be an eigenvector.\n\nApplying P to this vector:\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)c + 0*1 = (c)/\u221a2\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*1 +0*c + (1/\u221a2)*1 = (1/\u221a2 +1/\u221a2)= \u221a2\n\nThird component:0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*c +0*1 = (c)/\u221a2\n\nSo the resulting vector is ( c/\u221a2, \u221a2, c/\u221a2 )\n\nIf this is to be an eigenvector, then this should be proportional to (1, c,1).\n\nSo setting up equations:\n\nc/\u221a2 = \u03bb *1\n\n\u221a2 = \u03bb *c\n\nc/\u221a2 = \u03bb *1\n\nFrom first and third equations, they are the same. So from first equation, \u03bb = c/\u221a2. Then substituting into second equation:\n\n\u221a2 = (c/\u221a2)*c \u2192 \u221a2 = c\u00b2 / \u221a2 \u2192 \u221a2 * \u221a2 = c\u00b2 \u2192 2 = c\u00b2 \u2192 c = \u00b1\u221a2.\n\nLet me take c = \u221a2. Then \u03bb becomes ( \u221a2 ) / \u221a2 =1.\n\nSo then, the vector (1, \u221a2, 1) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1.\n\nSimilarly, if c = -\u221a2, then \u03bb would be -1, so the vector (1, -\u221a2, 1) would be an eigenvector with eigenvalue -1.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0. So the possible outcomes when measuring P are -1, 0, and 1.\n\nSo now, to find the probability of measuring 0, we need to find the component of the state vector in the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0.\n\nThe eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 are those vectors v such that Pv =0v. We found one such vector (1,0,-1). Are there others? Let's check the dimension of the eigenspace.\n\nThe matrix P has determinant zero, so the nullspace (eigenspace for eigenvalue 0) has dimension at least 1. Let me see if the rank is 2, so the nullspace is dimension 1. Let's see, the rank of P. The first and third rows are the same (transposed?), but let me see:\n\nOriginal matrix rows:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nSo rows 1 and 3 are the same. So the rank is at most 2. Since determinant is zero, the rank is less than 3, so rank 2, so nullspace is dimension 1. So the eigenspace for 0 is 1-dimensional, spanned by (1,0,-1).",

So rows 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.\n\nTherefore the minor is:\n\nRow 2 (columns 1 and 3): 1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow 3 (columns 1 and 3): 0, 0\n\nSo determinant of that minor is (1/\u221a2 * 0) - (1/\u221a2 * 0) = 0. \n\nTherefore, the determinant of P is 0 * ... - (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0 * ... = 0. \n\nSo determinant is zero, so 0 is indeed an eigenvalue of P. Good.\n\nNow, the next step is to find the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Let's do that. We need to solve (P - 0I)v = 0, so Pv = 0.\n\nLet me write the equations:\n\nFirst row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u21d2 (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u21d2 v2 =0\n\nSecond row: (1/\u221a2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 =0 \u21d2 (v1 + v3)/\u221a2 = 0 \u21d2 v1 + v3 =0\n\nThird row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)*v2 + 0*v3 =0 \u21d2 same as first equation, so v2=0.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nv2 =0,\n\nv1 + v3 =0,\n\nand v2=0 (redundant).\n\nSo the eigenvectors are vectors (v1, 0, v3) with v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenspace for eigenvalue 0 is the set of vectors of the form (a, 0, -a) where a is any real number.

That's interesting. So determinant is zero, so one of the eigenvalues is zero, which we already found. Since trace is zero, the sum of eigenvalues is zero, so the other two eigenvalues must be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. Let me denote them as a and -a. So eigenvalues are 0, a, -a. Then the determinant is 0*a*(-a) =0, which matches.\n\nNow, let's try to find the other eigenvalues. Let's consider the eigenvectors.\n\nWe found that (1,0,-1) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0. Let's see another possible eigenvector.\n\nSuppose we look for a vector in the direction (1, something, 1). Let me try (1, c, 1). Let's see if that can be an eigenvector.\n\nApplying P to this vector:\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)c + 0*1 = (c)/\u221a2\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*1 +0*c + (1/\u221a2)*1 = (1/\u221a2 +1/\u221a2)= \u221a2\n\nThird component:0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*c +0*1 = (c)/\u221a2\n\nSo the resulting vector is ( c/\u221a2, \u221a2, c/\u221a2 )\n\nIf this is to be an eigenvector, then this should be proportional to (1, c,1).\n\nSo setting up equations:\n\nc/\u221a2 = \u03bb *1\n\n\u221a2 = \u03bb *c\n\nc/\u221a2 = \u03bb *1\n\nFrom first and third equations, they are the same. So from first equation, \u03bb = c/\u221a2. Then substituting into second equation:\n\n\u221a2 = (c/\u221a2)*c \u2192 \u221a2 = c\u00b2 / \u221a2 \u2192 \u221a2 * \u221a2 = c\u00b2 \u2192 2 = c\u00b2 \u2192 c = \u00b1\u221a2.\n\nLet me take c = \u221a2. Then \u03bb becomes ( \u221a2 ) / \u221a2 =1.\n\nSo then, the vector (1, \u221a2, 1) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1.\n\nSimilarly, if c = -\u221a2, then \u03bb would be -1, so the vector (1, -\u221a2, 1) would be an eigenvector with eigenvalue -1.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0. So the possible outcomes when measuring P are -1, 0, and 1.\n\nSo now, to find the probability of measuring 0, we need to find the component of the state vector in the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0.\n\nThe eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 are those vectors v such that Pv =0v. We found one such vector (1,0,-1). Are there others? Let's check the dimension of the eigenspace.\n\nThe matrix P has determinant zero, so the nullspace (eigenspace for eigenvalue 0) has dimension at least 1. Let me see if the rank is 2, so the nullspace is dimension 1. Let's see, the rank of P. The first and third rows are the same (transposed?), but let me see:\n\nOriginal matrix rows:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nSo rows 1 and 3 are the same. So the rank is at most 2. Since determinant is zero, the rank is less than 3, so rank 2, so nullspace is dimension 1. So the eigenspace for 0 is 1-dimensional, spanned by (1,0,-1).",

So rows 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.\n\nTherefore the minor is:\n\nRow 2 (columns 1 and 3): 1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow 3 (columns 1 and 3): 0, 0\n\nSo determinant of that minor is (1/\u221a2 * 0) - (1/\u221a2 * 0) = 0. \n\nTherefore, the determinant of P is 0 * ... - (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0 * ... = 0. \n\nSo determinant is zero, so 0 is indeed an eigenvalue of P. Good.\n\nNow, the next step is to find the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Let's do that. We need to solve (P - 0I)v = 0, so Pv = 0.\n\nLet me write the equations:\n\nFirst row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u21d2 (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u21d2 v2 =0\n\nSecond row: (1/\u221a2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 =0 \u21d2 (v1 + v3)/\u221a2 = 0 \u21d2 v1 + v3 =0\n\nThird row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)*v2 + 0*v3 =0 \u21d2 same as first equation, so v2=0.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nv2 =0,\n\nv1 + v3 =0,\n\nand v2=0 (redundant).\n\nSo the eigenvectors are vectors (v1, 0, v3) with v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenspace for eigenvalue 0 is the set of vectors of the form (a, 0, -a) where a is any real number.

Similarly, any multiple of this vector is also an eigenvector.\n\nTherefore, the eigenspace for eigenvalue 0 is the span of (1,0,-1).\n\nSo the probability that the system is in this eigenspace is the squared modulus of the inner product of the state with this eigenvector (normalized), summed over all basis vectors in the eigenspace.

That's interesting. So determinant is zero, so one of the eigenvalues is zero, which we already found. Since trace is zero, the sum of eigenvalues is zero, so the other two eigenvalues must be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. Let me denote them as a and -a. So eigenvalues are 0, a, -a. Then the determinant is 0*a*(-a) =0, which matches.\n\nNow, let's try to find the other eigenvalues. Let's consider the eigenvectors.\n\nWe found that (1,0,-1) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0. Let's see another possible eigenvector.\n\nSuppose we look for a vector in the direction (1, something, 1). Let me try (1, c, 1). Let's see if that can be an eigenvector.\n\nApplying P to this vector:\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)c + 0*1 = (c)/\u221a2\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*1 +0*c + (1/\u221a2)*1 = (1/\u221a2 +1/\u221a2)= \u221a2\n\nThird component:0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*c +0*1 = (c)/\u221a2\n\nSo the resulting vector is ( c/\u221a2, \u221a2, c/\u221a2 )\n\nIf this is to be an eigenvector, then this should be proportional to (1, c,1).\n\nSo setting up equations:\n\nc/\u221a2 = \u03bb *1\n\n\u221a2 = \u03bb *c\n\nc/\u221a2 = \u03bb *1\n\nFrom first and third equations, they are the same. So from first equation, \u03bb = c/\u221a2. Then substituting into second equation:\n\n\u221a2 = (c/\u221a2)*c \u2192 \u221a2 = c\u00b2 / \u221a2 \u2192 \u221a2 * \u221a2 = c\u00b2 \u2192 2 = c\u00b2 \u2192 c = \u00b1\u221a2.\n\nLet me take c = \u221a2. Then \u03bb becomes ( \u221a2 ) / \u221a2 =1.\n\nSo then, the vector (1, \u221a2, 1) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1.\n\nSimilarly, if c = -\u221a2, then \u03bb would be -1, so the vector (1, -\u221a2, 1) would be an eigenvector with eigenvalue -1.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0. So the possible outcomes when measuring P are -1, 0, and 1.\n\nSo now, to find the probability of measuring 0, we need to find the component of the state vector in the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0.\n\nThe eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 are those vectors v such that Pv =0v. We found one such vector (1,0,-1). Are there others? Let's check the dimension of the eigenspace.\n\nThe matrix P has determinant zero, so the nullspace (eigenspace for eigenvalue 0) has dimension at least 1. Let me see if the rank is 2, so the nullspace is dimension 1. Let's see, the rank of P. The first and third rows are the same (transposed?), but let me see:\n\nOriginal matrix rows:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nSo rows 1 and 3 are the same. So the rank is at most 2. Since determinant is zero, the rank is less than 3, so rank 2, so nullspace is dimension 1. So the eigenspace for 0 is 1-dimensional, spanned by (1,0,-1).",

So rows 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.\n\nTherefore the minor is:\n\nRow 2 (columns 1 and 3): 1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow 3 (columns 1 and 3): 0, 0\n\nSo determinant of that minor is (1/\u221a2 * 0) - (1/\u221a2 * 0) = 0. \n\nTherefore, the determinant of P is 0 * ... - (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0 * ... = 0. \n\nSo determinant is zero, so 0 is indeed an eigenvalue of P. Good.\n\nNow, the next step is to find the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Let's do that. We need to solve (P - 0I)v = 0, so Pv = 0.\n\nLet me write the equations:\n\nFirst row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u21d2 (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u21d2 v2 =0\n\nSecond row: (1/\u221a2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 =0 \u21d2 (v1 + v3)/\u221a2 = 0 \u21d2 v1 + v3 =0\n\nThird row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)*v2 + 0*v3 =0 \u21d2 same as first equation, so v2=0.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nv2 =0,\n\nv1 + v3 =0,\n\nand v2=0 (redundant).\n\nSo the eigenvectors are vectors (v1, 0, v3) with v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenspace for eigenvalue 0 is the set of vectors of the form (a, 0, -a) where a is any real number.

So:\n\n-2/(2\u221a3) = -1/\u221a3. \n\nThe absolute square of that is (1/\u221a3)^2 = 1/3. \n\nTherefore the probability is 1/3, so the answer is C.",

That's interesting. So determinant is zero, so one of the eigenvalues is zero, which we already found. Since trace is zero, the sum of eigenvalues is zero, so the other two eigenvalues must be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. Let me denote them as a and -a. So eigenvalues are 0, a, -a. Then the determinant is 0*a*(-a) =0, which matches.\n\nNow, let's try to find the other eigenvalues. Let's consider the eigenvectors.\n\nWe found that (1,0,-1) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0. Let's see another possible eigenvector.\n\nSuppose we look for a vector in the direction (1, something, 1). Let me try (1, c, 1). Let's see if that can be an eigenvector.\n\nApplying P to this vector:\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)c + 0*1 = (c)/\u221a2\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*1 +0*c + (1/\u221a2)*1 = (1/\u221a2 +1/\u221a2)= \u221a2\n\nThird component:0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*c +0*1 = (c)/\u221a2\n\nSo the resulting vector is ( c/\u221a2, \u221a2, c/\u221a2 )\n\nIf this is to be an eigenvector, then this should be proportional to (1, c,1).\n\nSo setting up equations:\n\nc/\u221a2 = \u03bb *1\n\n\u221a2 = \u03bb *c\n\nc/\u221a2 = \u03bb *1\n\nFrom first and third equations, they are the same. So from first equation, \u03bb = c/\u221a2. Then substituting into second equation:\n\n\u221a2 = (c/\u221a2)*c \u2192 \u221a2 = c\u00b2 / \u221a2 \u2192 \u221a2 * \u221a2 = c\u00b2 \u2192 2 = c\u00b2 \u2192 c = \u00b1\u221a2.\n\nLet me take c = \u221a2. Then \u03bb becomes ( \u221a2 ) / \u221a2 =1.\n\nSo then, the vector (1, \u221a2, 1) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1.\n\nSimilarly, if c = -\u221a2, then \u03bb would be -1, so the vector (1, -\u221a2, 1) would be an eigenvector with eigenvalue -1.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0. So the possible outcomes when measuring P are -1, 0, and 1.\n\nSo now, to find the probability of measuring 0, we need to find the component of the state vector in the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0.\n\nThe eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 are those vectors v such that Pv =0v. We found one such vector (1,0,-1). Are there others? Let's check the dimension of the eigenspace.\n\nThe matrix P has determinant zero, so the nullspace (eigenspace for eigenvalue 0) has dimension at least 1. Let me see if the rank is 2, so the nullspace is dimension 1. Let's see, the rank of P. The first and third rows are the same (transposed?), but let me see:\n\nOriginal matrix rows:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nSo rows 1 and 3 are the same. So the rank is at most 2. Since determinant is zero, the rank is less than 3, so rank 2, so nullspace is dimension 1. So the eigenspace for 0 is 1-dimensional, spanned by (1,0,-1).",

So rows 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.\n\nTherefore the minor is:\n\nRow 2 (columns 1 and 3): 1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow 3 (columns 1 and 3): 0, 0\n\nSo determinant of that minor is (1/\u221a2 * 0) - (1/\u221a2 * 0) = 0. \n\nTherefore, the determinant of P is 0 * ... - (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0 * ... = 0. \n\nSo determinant is zero, so 0 is indeed an eigenvalue of P. Good.\n\nNow, the next step is to find the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Let's do that. We need to solve (P - 0I)v = 0, so Pv = 0.\n\nLet me write the equations:\n\nFirst row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u21d2 (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u21d2 v2 =0\n\nSecond row: (1/\u221a2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 =0 \u21d2 (v1 + v3)/\u221a2 = 0 \u21d2 v1 + v3 =0\n\nThird row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)*v2 + 0*v3 =0 \u21d2 same as first equation, so v2=0.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nv2 =0,\n\nv1 + v3 =0,\n\nand v2=0 (redundant).\n\nSo the eigenvectors are vectors (v1, 0, v3) with v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenspace for eigenvalue 0 is the set of vectors of the form (a, 0, -a) where a is any real number.
