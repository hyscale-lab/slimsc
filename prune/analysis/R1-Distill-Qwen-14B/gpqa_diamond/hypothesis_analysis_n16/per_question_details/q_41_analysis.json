The lab frame sees the glass moving at v, so to get the speed of the light in the lab frame, you have to add the velocities relativistically. But the velocity addition formula requires that the velocities are in the same direction. So the formula would be (u + v)/(1 + (uv/c\u00b2)), where u is c/n. \n\nLet me plug that in. Let me write it out step by step. Let me denote u = c/n. The speed of light in the glass's frame is u. The glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So the lab frame's measured speed of the light would be (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c\u00b2). Since in the problem, c is taken as 1, so substituting that in, the denominator becomes 1 + (u*v).",

Since in relativity, velocities don't just add, they combine via the formula u' = (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/c\u00b2). But here, the speed of light in the medium would be u = c/n in the medium's frame. So the lab frame would measure ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + (v*(c/n))/c\u00b2 ) \n\nLet me plug in c=1 here. Then:\n\nu' = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (v/(n)) /1 )\n\nBecause (v*(1/n)) /c\u00b2 is v/(n) since c=1. \n\nSo denominator is 1 + v/n.\n\nThus, the numerator is (1/n + v), denominator is (1 + v/n).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by n to simplify:\n\nNumerator: (1 + n v)\n\nDenominator: (n + v)\n\nSo the total becomes (1 + n v)/(n + v). Which is option A. \n\nOh! So that's the calculation.",
          "text2": "Alternatively, maybe the light's speed in the moving medium is (c/n + v), but that would be a classical addition. Let's see, since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is (1 + v)/n? But that would be (1 + v)/n, but none of the options have that either. \n\nHmm, maybe I need to approach this more carefully. Let's consider the relativistic velocity addition again. \n\nIn the medium's rest frame, the light is moving at speed u = 1/n (since c=1). The medium is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So to get u_lab, the velocity in the lab frame, the formula is:\n\nu_lab = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c\u00b2 )\n\nPlugging in u = 1/n and c=1:\n\nu_lab = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (1/n) * v ) )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: (1/n + v) = (1 + n v)/n\n\nDenominator: 1 + (v/n) = (n + v)/n\n\nTherefore, u_lab = [ (1 + n v)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n ] = (1 + n v) / (n + v )\n\nAh! That gives the numerator (1 + n*v) over denominator (n + v), which is exactly option A.",

But that would be v + (c/n), but as I saw before, that can reach c when v is (c - c/n). But according to relativity, that's not allowed. So that approach must be wrong. \n\nTherefore, the velocity addition formula is the correct method here, leading to option A. \n\nLooking at the options again, option A is (1 + n*v)/(n + v).
