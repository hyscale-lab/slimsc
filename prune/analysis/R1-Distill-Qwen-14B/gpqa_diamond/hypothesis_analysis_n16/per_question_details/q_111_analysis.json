The enolate from nitropropane (CH2-) would attack the \u03b2 carbon (position 3), forming a new bond. \n\nThe resulting structure would be: \n\nThe nitropropane's enolate (from C2) combines with the enenitrile, adding to the \u03b2 carbon (C3 of the enenitrile). The product would have the nitropropane's chain attached to the enenitrile's C3. \n\nThe original nitropropane has the nitro on C1, so after the addition, the structure would be:\n\nNitro (C1) \u2014 CH2 \u2014 (enolate part) attached to the enenitrile's C3. \n\nLet me try to sketch this. \n\nThe enolate is from the nitropropane's C2 (which is adjacent to nitro).

The carbanion (from nitropropane) attacks the beta carbon (the CH2 in CH2=CH-), forming a new bond. \n\nLet me sketch the steps:\n\nThe nitropropane (CH2CH2CH2NO2) loses a proton from the first CH2 (since it's alpha to the nitro), forming a carbanion on the first carbon (adjacent to nitro). The carbanion has a negative charge on the first carbon. It attacks the alpha carbon of the Michael acceptor (the enenitrile). The alpha carbon here would be the second carbon (since the double bond is between 1 and 2, and the nitrile is on 4). The attack would be on the carbon attached to the double bond (the CH2=CH- part). \n\nAttacking the beta carbon (the CH2 part of the double bond) would form a new bond. The result would be an addition across the double bond, leading to a four-carbon chain. The nitro group is on the first carbon of the original nitropropane, and the nitrile is on the fourth carbon (from the enenitrile). \n\nAfter the addition, the product would have the nitro group and nitrile separated by some carbons. Let's see:\n\nOriginal nitropropane: CH2-CH2-CH2-NO2 (but-1-nitro). The carbanion is on the first CH2 (adjacent to nitro). The enenitrile is CH2=CH-CH2-CN. \n\nThe attack would lead to:\n\nThe carbanion (from nitropropane) adds to the double bond's alpha carbon (the second carbon in the enenitrile's CH2=CH-). The new structure would be:\n\nThe nitropropane's first carbon (now with the negative charge) bonds to the second carbon of the enenitrile. The double bond becomes a single bond. \n\nThe resulting structure would be CH2-CH2-CH(Nitropropane part?)",
