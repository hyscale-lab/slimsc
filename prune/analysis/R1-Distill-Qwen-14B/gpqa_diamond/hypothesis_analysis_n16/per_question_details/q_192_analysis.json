Or exactly the same as a charge placed at the cavity's location?\n\nActually, I think the correct answer is that the field outside is the same as if the charge were placed at the cavity's center. Because the conductor's charges arrange such that their influence cancels the field inside the conductor and the cavity's charge's direct field outside is blocked, but the outer charges recreate the field as if the charge were there.",
          "text2": "Wait, when you have a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the field outside is the same as if the charge were placed at the center? No, that's only if the conductor is a spherical shell and the cavity is spherical.",

Even if the charge is displaced in the cavity, the outer surface's charge rearranges to make the field outside as if it's a point charge at the center. \n\nIf that's the case, then the answer would be B.",
          "text2": "Wait, but that's only true if the cavity is within the conductor. Because the conductor's material has zero field inside. The charge inside the cavity doesn't affect the field outside except through the total charge on the outer surface. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B.",
