Since the conductor's outer surface has +q, the field outside should only depend on q and the distance from the center of the conductor. So the field at P is E = (1/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080)) * q / L\u00b2, which is option B.",

So E would be (1/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080)) * q / L\u00b2. Because the formula for the electric field of a point charge is E = kq / r\u00b2, where r is the distance from the charge.\n\nBut let me think again. The conductor's outer surface has charge +q, and the point P is outside. So the field is due to the outer charge, which is distributed on the outer surface. But from the outside, the field is the same as if all the charge were at the center. So the field at P is E = (1/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080)) * q / L\u00b2.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is E = (1/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080)) q / L\u00b2. Option D is similar, but with l squared.",

The charge on the outer surface is +q, so for any point outside (like P), the electric field would be the same as if the charge +q were at the center of the sphere. So regardless of where the cavity is located, the external field depends only on the outer surface's charge and the distance from the center.\n\nSo in this case, the answer should be option B: E = (1/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080)) q / L\u00b2.",
          "text2": "Wait, but wait. The charge is inside the cavity, which is off-center. Does that affect anything? Because the conductor's inner surface would have an induced charge, but the outer surface would still be symmetric, right? Because the conductor is a sphere, and the outer surface is a shell. So the location of the inner charge (cavity) doesn't matter for the external field. Because the outer surface's charges will arrange themselves symmetrically to cancel any internal fields. So the external field is the same as if all the charge were at the center.\n\nSo, the answer would be option B: E = (1/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080)) * q / L\u00b2.",
