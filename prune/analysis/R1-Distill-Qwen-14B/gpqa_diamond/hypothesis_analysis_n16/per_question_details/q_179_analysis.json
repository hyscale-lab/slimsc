So (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) is a similarity transformation of Y. Y would be similar to whatever matrix under this transformation.\n\nBut what defines a quantum state? Well, density matrices must be positive semi-definite, Hermitian, and have trace 1. Y is a 3x3 matrix. Let me check if Y is Hermitian.

So the transformed matrix would also be a density matrix, thus a quantum state. So option B seems correct.",

Since X is not Hermitian, e^X isn't unitary. Because for a matrix U to be unitary, U\u2020 U = I. If U = e^X, then U\u2020 U = e^{X\u2020} e^{X} = e^{X\u2020 + X}, which equals I only if X is skew-Hermitian (X\u2020 = -X). In that case, X\u2020 + X = 0, so e^0 = I.\n\nBut in our case, X isn't skew-Hermitian. Let's check X + X\u2020.
