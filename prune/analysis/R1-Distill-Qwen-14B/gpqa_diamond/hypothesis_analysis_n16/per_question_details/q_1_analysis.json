          "text2": "Wait, different sources might use different factors here. Let me recall the exact relation. The energy-time uncertainty principle is \u0394E \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2. So, the minimum uncertainty would be \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(2\u0394t). \n\nSo for each state, the uncertainty in energy would be roughly \u0127 divided by twice the lifetime. Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, let's compute the values. Let's note that \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. To convert eV and seconds, remember that 1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J. \n\nBut maybe we can work with the ratio here. Let's see:\n\nThe uncertainty in energy for the first state (\u0394E1) would be approximately \u0127/(2\u03c41), and similarly for the second state (\u0394E2 \u2248 \u0127/(2\u03c42)). The total uncertainty to consider might be the sum of both, or maybe the maximum of the two? Since the two states have different lifetimes, their uncertainties are different. The first state has a shorter lifetime (1e-9 s) so its energy uncertainty is larger. For example, \u03c41 is 1e-9, so \u0394E1 is ~ \u0127/(2e-9), and \u03c42 is 1e-8 s, so \u0394E2 is ~ \u0127/(2e-8). Thus, \u0394E1 is 10 times larger than \u0394E2. Because \u03c42 is 10 times longer than \u03c41, so the uncertainty is smaller. \n\nSo the largest uncertainty is \u0394E1. If the energy difference between the two states is larger than both \u0394E1 and \u0394E2, then they can be distinguished. Since \u0394E1 is the bigger of the two, the energy difference must be greater than \u0394E1.

Let me do the calculation again with actual numbers.\n\nFirst, let's use the formula \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / (\u0394t). Let's plug in the numbers:\n\nFor the first state (\u0394t1 =1e-9 s):\n\n\u0394E1 = (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s) / (1e-9 s) \n\nWhich is 1.0545718e-25 J. Converting that to eV:\n\n1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so divide by that:\n\n\u0394E1 = (1.0545718e-25 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) \u2248 6.58e-7 eV. Okay same as before.\n\nSecond state (\u0394t2=1e-8 s):\n\n\u0394E2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J, then divide by 1.6e-19 gives 6.58e-8 eV. So that's correct.\n\nSo the energy uncertainty of the first state is 6.58e-7 eV, and the second is 6.58e-8 eV. The larger uncertainty is the first one. Therefore, the energy difference between the two states must be larger than the largest uncertainty (the first one) to be resolved. Because if the energy difference is smaller than that uncertainty, the two states would overlap in energy measurement.\n\nTherefore, the energy difference needs to be greater than ~6.58e-7 eV. The options are looking for which energy difference could be resolved. Let's look at the options:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.000000001 eV \u2192 which is smaller than 6.5e-7 \u2192 not enough.\n\nB) 1e-11 \u2192 even smaller.\n\nC) 1e-4 \u2192 0.0001 eV \u2192 which is way larger. That would work.\n\nD) 1e-8 \u2192 which is 0.00000001 eV \u2192 which is 1e-8. The required threshold is ~6.5e-7, so 1e-8 is smaller than that?",
