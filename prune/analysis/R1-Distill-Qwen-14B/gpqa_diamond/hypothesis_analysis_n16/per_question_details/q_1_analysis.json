Otherwise, their energy ranges might overlap, making it impossible to tell them apart.\n\nSo, let's compute the individual uncertainties.\n\nFirst, let's get the value of \u0127. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s. So \u0127 is h/(2\u03c0) \u2248 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nSo, \u0394E1 = \u0127 / \u03c41 = (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s) / (1e-9 s) \u2248 1.05e-25 J.

Because if the separation is larger than the combined uncertainties, the two states won't be confused. So the condition is \u0394E > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2.\n\nLet me compute the uncertainties first. The reduced Planck constant \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nSo for state 1: \u03c41=1e-9 s.\n\n\u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127/(2 \u03c41) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) \u2248 5.27e-26 J.\n\nHmm, but we usually work in eV when dealing with atomic scales. Let me convert that to eV.\n\n1 eV is 1.602176634e-19 J.

Let's proceed and see.\n\nThe idea is that the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty in energy for the two states to be distinguishable. So, if the energy difference \u0394E is much larger than the uncertainty in energy (\u0394E > \u0394E_uncertainty), then we can resolve them. But if \u0394E is too small, the uncertainty might blur the two states into each other, making them indistinguishable.\n\nSo, for each state, the uncertainty in energy (\u0394E) would be \u0127/(2\u03c4). Because the formula is \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/ (2\u0394t), and \u0394t is the uncertainty in time, which is the lifetime \u03c4. Or maybe I should think it's \u0127/\u03c4 because some sources might use \u0394t as the full \u03c4.",

I remember it's approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. Oh, but the problem uses eV as the unit. I need to convert \u0127 into eV\u00b7s. Let me think. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules.

So for E1, the uncertainty is \u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c41, and for E2, \u0394E2 \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c42.\n\nSo, if the energy difference between E1 and E2 is larger than the sum of these two uncertainties, then the two states can be clearly distinguished. Otherwise, their energy ranges might overlap, making it impossible to tell them apart.\n\nSo, let's compute the individual uncertainties.\n\nFirst, let's get the value of \u0127. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s. So \u0127 is h/(2\u03c0) \u2248 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nSo, \u0394E1 = \u0127 / \u03c41 = (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s) / (1e-9 s) \u2248 1.05e-25 J.

Because if the separation is larger than the combined uncertainties, the two states won't be confused. So the condition is \u0394E > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2.\n\nLet me compute the uncertainties first. The reduced Planck constant \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nSo for state 1: \u03c41=1e-9 s.\n\n\u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127/(2 \u03c41) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) \u2248 5.27e-26 J.\n\nHmm, but we usually work in eV when dealing with atomic scales. Let me convert that to eV.\n\n1 eV is 1.602176634e-19 J. So to convert from J to eV, divide by 1.602e-19.\n\nSo \u0394E1 \u2248 5.27e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV \u2248 3.29e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, for state 2: \u03c42=1e-8 s.\n\n\u0394E2 = \u0127/(2 \u03c42) = (1.0545e-34) / (2e-8) = approx 5.27e-27 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 5.27e-27 / 1.602e-19 \u2248 3.29e-8 eV.\n\nSo \u0394E1 is about 3.29e-7 eV, and \u0394E2 is about 3.29e-8 eV.\n\nSo the sum of these would be approximately 3.62e-7 eV.

Let's proceed and see.\n\nThe idea is that the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty in energy for the two states to be distinguishable. So, if the energy difference \u0394E is much larger than the uncertainty in energy (\u0394E > \u0394E_uncertainty), then we can resolve them. But if \u0394E is too small, the uncertainty might blur the two states into each other, making them indistinguishable.\n\nSo, for each state, the uncertainty in energy (\u0394E) would be \u0127/(2\u03c4). Because the formula is \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/ (2\u0394t), and \u0394t is the uncertainty in time, which is the lifetime \u03c4. Or maybe I should think it's \u0127/\u03c4 because some sources might use \u0394t as the full \u03c4.",
