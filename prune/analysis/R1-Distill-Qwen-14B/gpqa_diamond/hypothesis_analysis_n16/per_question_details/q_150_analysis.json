          "text2": "Wait, the reactions are diazotization followed by some hydrolysis? Let me think of the reactions step by step.\n\nFirst, diazotization: the primary aryl amine forms a diazonium salt (Ar-N+\u2261N). Then, adding H2O might just be to wash or neutralize, but maybe the next step is the important part: KOH, heat. \n\nIn the final step, heating with aqueous KOH. That sounds like a hydrolysis of the diazonium salt. Diazonium salts can be hydrolyzed to give phenols. For example, the diazonium salt of aniline (Ar-NH2) would hydrolyze to Ar-OH when treated with water or base. But here, the second step is H2O, then KOH and heat. So perhaps after diazotization, the diazonium salt is treated with base and heat, leading to formation of a phenol group where the amine was.\n\nTherefore, the original compound had an amino group, which upon diazotization and hydrolysis becomes a hydroxy group. \n\nNow, let's get back to the structure. The original compound has an aldehyde group (from the 9.72 ppm peak), an amino group (since it can undergo diazotization), and other groups. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's try to figure out the structure.\n\nThe molecular formula C8H9NO:\n\nCarbon atoms: 8.\n\nHydrogens: 9.\n\nNitrogen: 1.\n\nOxygen: 1.\n\nSo, considering the aldehyde (CHO) contributes one O. The N is part of an amine group (since it undergoes diazotization). Let me try to construct the molecule.\n\nSuppose the structure is 2-aminobenzaldehyde. Its formula would be C7H7NO. But we need C8H9NO. So where's the extra CH2? Maybe there's a side chain. Let's consider:\n\nSuppose the structure is 3-aminophenylacetaldehyde.
