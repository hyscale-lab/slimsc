Hydrolysis replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group.\n\n3. KOH and heat cause elimination, forming a double bond.\n\nSo after step 2, the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CHO.\n\nIn step 3, under basic conditions, elimination occurs. The OH group is on the CH, adjacent to the CHO group. KOH would deprotonate, leading to the formation of a double bond between the CH and the adjacent CH\u2082 group, forming Ph-CH\u2082-CH=CHO.",
