To find maximum, take derivative:\n\ndf/dE = 2E(Q-E)^2 + E\u00b2*2(Q-E)(-1) \n\nSetting to zero:\n\n2E(Q-E)^2 - 2E\u00b2(Q-E) = 0 \n\nFactor out 2E(Q-E):\n\n2E(Q-E)[(Q-E) - E] = 0 \n\nThus, the non-trivial solution is when (Q-E) - E = 0 \u2192 Q-E = E \u2192 Q = 2E \u2192 E = Q/2. \n\nSo peak at E = Q/2 = 430.5 keV. \n\nSo the distribution peaks at 430 keV, and the shape is symmetric around that? Not exactly, but the peak is there. \n\nThe total area under the curve from 0 to Q gives the total number of neutrinos. \n\nNow, the contribution to band1 (700-800 keV) and band2 (800-900).",

Whereas the pp-III (B-8) neutrinos would go up to 14.6 MeV, so they would contribute to both bands. \n\nSo, the total flux in each energy band is the sum of contributions from all active reactions. Before the pp-III branch stopped, the pp-III neutrinos (B-8 decay) contribute to both bands. But when pp-III is stopped, those contributions are removed. So we need to see how much the pp-III contributes to each band compared to other reactions. \n\nThe question is asking for the ratio of flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) to band 2 (800-900 keV) after the pp-III is stopped.",

Or perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are emitted once per B-8 decay, which happens in the chain after pp-II. \n\nActually, the pp chain proceeds as: \n\npp-I: p + p \u2192 D + e+ + \u03bd (most common, ~88%)\n\npp-II: Be-7 (from pp-I) captures a proton to form B-8, which then beta-decays (Be-7 \u2192 Be-7* \u2192 B-8 + \u03b3, then B-8 decays via pp-III. \n\nThe pp-II branch is when Be-7 captures a proton to form B-8*, which then decays into B-8 plus gamma, but then the B-8 undergoes beta decay (pp-III).

The energy here is around 0.86 MeV (860 keV)\n3. B-8 decay: Boron-8 beta decays to nitrogen-8, emitting a neutrino with energy up to ~14.6 MeV (but that's way higher than the given bands)\n4. pep reaction: similar to pp but with a different path, producing neutrinos around 1.44 MeV (but that's higher than 900 keV?)",
          "text2": "Wait, but the question's bands are 700-800 and 800-900. So the neutrinos from pp-III (Be-7) would contribute to both bands. However, the question says that the pp-III branch has just stopped 8.5 minutes ago, so the neutrinos from that branch would no longer be arriving. \n\nTherefore, the flux from pp-III in both bands would be removed. But how does that affect the ratio?\n\nWe need to consider which other branches contribute to these energy bands. \n\nThe other neutrino sources:\n\n- pp-I neutrinos are at ~0.42 MeV (420 keV), so they are below 700 keV and thus not in either of the bands in question. \n\n- pp-II's neutrinos come from B-8 decay. Each B-8 decay gives two neutrinos with maximum energy ~9 MeV. The neutrinos from B-8 decay would have an energy distribution from 0 up to ~9 MeV. But the question is about the 700-800 and 800-900 keV bands. The B-8 neutrinos would contribute to both bands as well, since their energy can be in those ranges. \n\nAdditionally, there's also the Be-8 decay, but I'm not sure.",

Let's see:\n\nBand 1 (700-800 keV):\n\n- The B-8 decay neutrinos (pp-II) have max energy ~765 keV. So their energy range is up to ~765 keV.

For example, the number of neutrinos between 700-800 would be more than between 800-862 (since it's a lower energy range). \n\nTherefore, the original ratio (band1 / band2) would be greater than 1. \n\nBut how much exactly? Let's think of the differential flux. The neutrino spectrum from a beta decay is proportional to the square of (E_max - E) (for a Fermi-type spectrum, ignoring more complex factors). The total number in an interval from E1 to E2 would be the integral of the flux over that interval. \n\nAssuming that the flux is decreasing as (E_max - E)^2 (simplified), then the number of neutrinos between 700-800 would be the integral from 700 to 800 of (E_max - E)^2 dE, and between 800-862 (since 862 is the max, but here the question's band is up to 900, but the actual max is 862).",

Thus, the neutrinos from pp-III are no longer present. \n\nTherefore, the flux in the energy bands that were contributed by pp-III neutrinos would decrease. \n\nThe Be7 neutrinos contribute to both bands, but the pp-III neutrinos also contribute to those bands. \n\nSo the total flux in each band is:\n\nBand1 (700-800):\n\nContributions from Be7 and pp-III neutrinos.\n\nBand2 (800-900):\n\nContributions from Be7 and pp-III neutrinos. \n\nBy stopping pp-III, we remove their contribution to both bands. \n\nThus the new flux ratio is (Be7_band1) / (Be7_band2). \n\nOriginally, the flux ratio was (Be7+ppIII_band1)/(Be7+ppIII_band2). \n\nBut after stopping pp-III, it's (Be7_band1)/(Be7_band2). \n\nThe question asks for the new ratio. \n\nTherefore, we need to find what the ratio would be if pp-III's contribution is subtracted. \n\nAssuming that pp-III neutrinos contribute to both bands, their removal would lower the fluxes in both, but the question is about the ratio after removal. \n\nThe ratio would now be just the Be7's ratio. \n\nEarlier, we calculated that Be7's ratio is ~5. \n\nBut since the options don't have that, perhaps the question assumes that the pp-III neutrinos contribution to band1 is much larger than Be7's, so removing pp-III would invert the ratio. \n\nFor instance, if pp-III's contribution to band1 is large, then after removing it, the flux in band1 drops significantly while band2's flux drops less, leading to a lower ratio. \n\nBut we need to estimate the contributions. \n\nThe pp-III neutrinos have a maximum energy of ~19 MeV. Their spectrum includes all energies below that. The contribution to the 700-800 keV range would be part of their spectrum. \n\nThe number of pp-III neutrinos in that range depends on their energy distribution. \n\nAssuming their spectrum is also dN/dE ~ E^2 (Q-E), but with Q=19 MeV, then the contribution to the low energy bands would be significant. \n\nThe integral from 700 keV to 800 keV of their spectrum would be a small fraction of their total flux. \n\nBut the total pp-III neutrino flux is much smaller than Be7's.",
          "text2": "Wait, that seems plausible. So the pp-III branch is the direct decay of Be-7, producing a neutrino with energy up to ~861 keV. The pp-II branch is when Be-7 captures a proton to form B-8, which then decays to emit a neutrino at ~765 keV. \n\nSo, in this case:\n\n- pp-III's neutrinos are from Be-7 decay, energy up to ~861 keV (so in the 0-861 keV range).\n\n- pp-II's neutrinos are from B-8 decay, up to ~765 keV.\n\n- The pp-I's first step gives neutrinos up to ~420 keV.\n\nSo now, the question states that the pp-III branch has just stopped. Therefore, the neutrinos from Be-7 decay (the pp-III branch) would no longer be produced. \n\nThe question asks for the ratio of flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nBefore the pp-III branch stopped, both bands would have contributions. Let's see:\n\nBand 1 (700-800 keV):\n\n- The B-8 decay neutrinos (pp-II) have max energy ~765 keV. So their energy range is up to ~765 keV. So the 700-800 band would include the high end of those neutrinos (from ~700 to 765 keV). \n\n- The pp-III neutrinos (from Be-7 decay) have max energy ~861 keV. So their energy goes up to 861, so the 700-800 keV band would include all of their neutrinos from 700 up to 800 keV (since their max is 861). \n\nBand 2 (800-900 keV):\n\n- The pp-III neutrinos contribute here, from 800 up to 861 keV.\n\n- The B-8 (pp-II) neutrinos don't reach 800 keV, since their max is 765. So band 2's only contribution before stopping pp-III was from pp-III.\n\nTherefore, before stopping, the flux in band 1 comes from both pp-II (B-8 decay) and pp-III (Be-7 decay). The flux in band 2 comes only from pp-III.\n\nAfter stopping pp-III, band 1 will have only the contribution from pp-II (B-8 decay), and band 2 will have zero contribution (since pp-III is stopped), but wait, the question says \"suddenly stopped 8.5 minutes ago\".",
