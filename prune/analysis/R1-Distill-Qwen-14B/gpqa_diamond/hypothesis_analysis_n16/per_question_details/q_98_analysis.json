The vinyl is on 2, propenyl on 1. \n\nIf the starting material has a double bond at position 2 (like B), then when the ring opens to form the cyclopentane, that double bond becomes the vinyl group. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B.",

The two double bonds could undergo metathesis with the propene's, so one becomes the vinyl, and the other combines with propene to form the propenyl.\n\nI think option C is more likely, because the product's cyclopentane must already be present in the starting material. If the starting material has a cyclopentane ring with double bonds, then the metathesis with propene would form the substituents while keeping the ring. So option C would be the correct answer.",
