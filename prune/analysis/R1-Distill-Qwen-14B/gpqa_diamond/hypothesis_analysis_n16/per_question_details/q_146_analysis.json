So in the diene, carbon 4 is part of the diene's end (the other end being carbon 1). So, when the dienophile adds across carbons 1 and 4, the substituent on carbon 4 (which is adjacent to fluorine) would end up on a specific face.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the endo and exo transition states.\n\nIn the endo transition state, the substituents of the dienophile and the diene are on the same face, leading to the substituents being on the same side in the product.\n\nSo, the fluorine, which is on the diene, would be on the same face as the dienophile's substituents (the carbonyl groups) in the transition state.\n\nSo, in the product, the fluorine would end up on a specific side relative to the new substituents.\n\nBut perhaps the product's configuration depends on the bridge formation.",
