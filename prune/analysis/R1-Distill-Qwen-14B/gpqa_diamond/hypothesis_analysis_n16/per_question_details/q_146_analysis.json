The cyclopentadiene's double bonds would be in a way that allows the proper overlap for the Diels-Alder.\n\nThe major product's stereochemistry will depend on the orientation of the diene and dienophile. The Diels-Alder reaction typically forms a bicyclic structure with the diene's carbons forming the bridgehead. The stereochemistry of the bridgehead carbons is determined by the diene's orientation. Also, the maleic anhydride's oxygen and the fluorine's position on the ring will influence the final product's structure.\n\nLooking at the options, all products are tetrahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione with different stereo labels. The key is to track the substituents (fluorine and the oxygen from maleic anhydride) in the product.\n\nIn the Diels-Alder reaction, the dienophile's substituents (like the oxygen in maleic anhydride) will end up on a specific carbon. The fluorine is on carbon 5 of the diene. When the Diels-Alder occurs, the diene's carbons 1 and 3 (maybe?) will form the bridgehead.

The Diels-Alder is a pericyclic reaction, which follows the Woodward-Hoffmann rules. The reaction proceeds via a concerted mechanism, so the configuration of the substituents in the diene and dienophile will influence the stereochemistry of the product.\n\nNow, the key is figuring out the stereochemistry of the product. The diene here is cyclopenta-1,3-diene with a fluorine on C5. Let me consider the orientation of the diene. The cyclopentadiene has a planar structure.
