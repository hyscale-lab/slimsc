Let me check the exact values again. \n\nLet's look up the exact atomic mass of Li-6. \n\nUpon checking (from memory or standard tables), the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0151228 u. \n\nThe exact conversion from u to MeV/c\u00b2 is 1 u = 931.49410242 MeV/c\u00b2. \n\nSo let me recalculate the mass energy precisely. \n\nMass of Li-6 nucleus: 6.0151228 u (atomic mass) minus electrons. \n\nElectrons: 3 electrons. Each electron is 0.000548579909 u (exact value from NIST). So total electrons: 3 * 0.000548579909 = 0.0016457397 u. \n\nThus, the nuclear mass is 6.0151228 u - 0.0016457397 u = 6.0134770603 u. \n\nNow, converting that to MeV/c\u00b2:\n\n6.0134770603 u * 931.49410242 MeV/u \n\nLet me compute this precisely. \n\nLet me compute 6.0134770603 \u00d7 931.49410242. \n\nFirst, break it into 6 + 0.0134770603. \n\n6 * 931.49410242 = 5588.96461452 MeV.\n\n0.0134770603 * 931.49410242 = ?\n\nCompute 0.01 * 931.49410242 = 9.3149410242\n\n0.0034770603 *931.49410242 \u2248 \n\nFirst, 0.003 *931.494 = 2.794482\n\n0.0004770603 *931.494 \u2248 0.0004 *931.494 = 0.3726, plus 0.0000770603*931.494\u22480.0718. \n\nAdding these: 0.3726 +0.0718\u22480.4444. \n\nSo total for 0.003477 part is 2.794482 +0.4444\u22483.2389. \n\nTherefore total of 0.013477 part is 9.31494 +3.2389 \u224812.5538 MeV. \n\nAdding to 5588.9646 gives 5588.9646 +12.5538 =5601.5184 MeV. \n\nSo the nuclear mass energy is 5601.5184 MeV, which is 5.6015184 GeV. \n\nMultiply by gamma (3.5714285714):\n\n5.6015184 GeV * 3.5714285714 \n\nLet me compute this with more precision. \n\nLet me write gamma as 25/7 exactly. Because 3.5714285714 is 25/7 (since 25 divided by 7 is 3.571428...). \n\nSo 5.6015184 GeV * (25/7) \n\n= (5.6015184 *25)/7 \n\n5.6015184 *25 = 140.03796 \n\nDivide by 7: 140.03796 /7 \u224820.005423 GeV. \n\nHmm, so that's approximately 20.005 GeV. \n\nLooking at the options again, option C is 20.132, which is about 0.127 GeV higher. \n\nHmm, maybe I messed up the calculation of the mass? Or perhaps I need to consider the binding energy of the nucleus?",

Or the total energy of the nucleus. I need to clarify that. Let me think again. The problem states \"the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c\". So the speed of the entire nucleus is 0.96c. Therefore, the total energy would be gamma times the rest mass energy of the nucleus. But the options are in GeV, which is a common unit. \n\nFirst, let me compute the rest mass of Li-6. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately... I need the mass in terms of atomic mass units (u), then convert to energy. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0151228 u, but I might need to look up exact value.",

The square root of 0.0784 is sqrt(0.0784). Let me compute sqrt(0.0784). Well, sqrt(0.09) is 0.3, sqrt(0.0625)=0.25. So 0.0784 is between them. Let me see, 0.28 squared is 0.784, so sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28.

So my calculation is leading to approximately 20 GeV, but the closest option is C at 20.132. The difference might be due to more precise values of the atomic mass or the constants. Let me check the exact values again. \n\nLet's look up the exact atomic mass of Li-6. \n\nUpon checking (from memory or standard tables), the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0151228 u. \n\nThe exact conversion from u to MeV/c\u00b2 is 1 u = 931.49410242 MeV/c\u00b2. \n\nSo let me recalculate the mass energy precisely. \n\nMass of Li-6 nucleus: 6.0151228 u (atomic mass) minus electrons. \n\nElectrons: 3 electrons.

Let's compute:\n\ngamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - 0.9216)) = 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...\n\nSo multiply that by 5.603084 GeV.\n\nSo 5.603084 * 3.57142857.

Let me do 5.603084 * 3.57142857:\n\nMultiply 5.603084 by 3.57142857:\n\nLet me write it as 5.603084 * (3 + 0.5 + 0.07142857)",

So the nucleus is Li-6. The mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015 atomic mass units, right? Let me recall that the exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.01512277 u. Let me confirm that.

Then 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let me compute sqrt(0.0784). Let's see, 0.28 squared is 0.0784 (since 0.28*0.28 = 0.0784). So sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. Therefore, gamma is 1/0.28 \u2248 3.57142857. So gamma \u2248 3.57142857.\n\nSo then, the total energy would be gamma * m c\u00b2. But the problem is, what is m?

Let's compute gamma first.\n\nLet me compute gamma. The speed v is 0.96c. So:\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)\n\nCalculating 0.96 squared: 0.96 * 0.96.

So my calculation is leading to approximately 20 GeV, but the closest option is C at 20.132. The difference might be due to more precise values of the atomic mass or the constants. Let me check the exact values again. \n\nLet's look up the exact atomic mass of Li-6. \n\nUpon checking (from memory or standard tables), the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0151228 u. \n\nThe exact conversion from u to MeV/c\u00b2 is 1 u = 931.49410242 MeV/c\u00b2. \n\nSo let me recalculate the mass energy precisely. \n\nMass of Li-6 nucleus: 6.0151228 u (atomic mass) minus electrons. \n\nElectrons: 3 electrons.

Let's compute:\n\ngamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - 0.9216)) = 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...\n\nSo multiply that by 5.603084 GeV.\n\nSo 5.603084 * 3.57142857.

Let me do 5.603084 * 3.57142857:\n\nMultiply 5.603084 by 3.57142857:\n\nLet me write it as 5.603084 * (3 + 0.5 + 0.07142857)",

So the nucleus is Li-6. The mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015 atomic mass units, right? Let me recall that the exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.01512277 u. Let me confirm that.

Then 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let me compute sqrt(0.0784). Let's see, 0.28 squared is 0.0784 (since 0.28*0.28 = 0.0784). So sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. Therefore, gamma is 1/0.28 \u2248 3.57142857. So gamma \u2248 3.57142857.\n\nSo then, the total energy would be gamma * m c\u00b2. But the problem is, what is m?

Let's compute gamma first.\n\nLet me compute gamma. The speed v is 0.96c. So:\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)\n\nCalculating 0.96 squared: 0.96 * 0.96.

Let me check the question again: \n\n\"What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?\"\n\nProbably the energy here is the total energy of the nucleus. So my calculation is leading to approximately 20 GeV, but the closest option is C at 20.132. The difference might be due to more precise values of the atomic mass or the constants. Let me check the exact values again. \n\nLet's look up the exact atomic mass of Li-6. \n\nUpon checking (from memory or standard tables), the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0151228 u. \n\nThe exact conversion from u to MeV/c\u00b2 is 1 u = 931.49410242 MeV/c\u00b2. \n\nSo let me recalculate the mass energy precisely. \n\nMass of Li-6 nucleus: 6.0151228 u (atomic mass) minus electrons. \n\nElectrons: 3 electrons. Each electron is 0.000548579909 u (exact value from NIST). So total electrons: 3 * 0.000548579909 = 0.0016457397 u. \n\nThus, the nuclear mass is 6.0151228 u - 0.0016457397 u = 6.0134770603 u. \n\nNow, converting that to MeV/c\u00b2:\n\n6.0134770603 u * 931.49410242 MeV/u \n\nLet me compute this precisely. \n\nLet me compute 6.0134770603 \u00d7 931.49410242. \n\nFirst, break it into 6 + 0.0134770603. \n\n6 * 931.49410242 = 5588.96461452 MeV.\n\n0.0134770603 * 931.49410242 = ?\n\nCompute 0.01 * 931.49410242 = 9.3149410242\n\n0.0034770603 *931.49410242 \u2248 \n\nFirst, 0.003 *931.494 = 2.794482\n\n0.0004770603 *931.494 \u2248 0.0004 *931.494 = 0.3726, plus 0.0000770603*931.494\u22480.0718. \n\nAdding these: 0.3726 +0.0718\u22480.4444. \n\nSo total for 0.003477 part is 2.794482 +0.4444\u22483.2389. \n\nTherefore total of 0.013477 part is 9.31494 +3.2389 \u224812.5538 MeV. \n\nAdding to 5588.9646 gives 5588.9646 +12.5538 =5601.5184 MeV. \n\nSo the nuclear mass energy is 5601.5184 MeV, which is 5.6015184 GeV. \n\nMultiply by gamma (3.5714285714):\n\n5.6015184 GeV * 3.5714285714 \n\nLet me compute this with more precision. \n\nLet me write gamma as 25/7 exactly.
