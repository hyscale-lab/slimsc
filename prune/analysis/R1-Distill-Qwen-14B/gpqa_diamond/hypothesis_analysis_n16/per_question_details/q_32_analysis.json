So why the difference?\n\nBecause the actual mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of individual protons and neutrons due to binding energy. So using the exact atomic mass from the table is more accurate. So in this problem, I should use the atomic mass given by the periodic table.\n\nSo using 6.017566 u is more precise. So E0 is 6.017566 *931.5 MeV = let's compute that more accurately.\n\nCompute 6.017566 * 931.5.\n\nI can compute 6 *931.5 = 5589.\n\n0.017566 *931.5 = let me compute exactly:\n\n0.01 *931.5 = 9.315\n\n0.007 *931.5 = 6.5205\n\n0.000566 *931.5 = 0.526 (approx 0.000566 *900=0.5094, 0.000566*31.5\u22480.0178, total \u22480.5272)\n\nAdding these: 9.315 +6.5205=15.8355; 15.8355 +0.5272=16.3627.\n\nSo total E0 =5589 +16.3627=5605.3627 MeV, which is 5.6053627 GeV.\n\nSo E0 is approximately 5.60536 GeV.\n\nNow, the energy E is gamma * E0. Gamma is 3.57142857.\n\nSo E = 3.57142857 *5.60536 GeV.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3 *5.60536 is 16.81608 GeV.\n\n0.57142857 *5.60536 = Let's compute 0.5 *5.60536=2.80268, 0.07142857 *5.60536\u22480.07142857 *5.60536.",

So why the difference?\n\nBecause the actual mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of individual protons and neutrons due to binding energy. So using the exact atomic mass from the table is more accurate. So in this problem, I should use the atomic mass given by the periodic table.\n\nSo using 6.017566 u is more precise. So E0 is 6.017566 *931.5 MeV = let's compute that more accurately.\n\nCompute 6.017566 * 931.5.\n\nI can compute 6 *931.5 = 5589.\n\n0.017566 *931.5 = let me compute exactly:\n\n0.01 *931.5 = 9.315\n\n0.007 *931.5 = 6.5205\n\n0.000566 *931.5 = 0.526 (approx 0.000566 *900=0.5094, 0.000566*31.5\u22480.0178, total \u22480.5272)\n\nAdding these: 9.315 +6.5205=15.8355; 15.8355 +0.5272=16.3627.\n\nSo total E0 =5589 +16.3627=5605.3627 MeV, which is 5.6053627 GeV.\n\nSo E0 is approximately 5.60536 GeV.\n\nNow, the energy E is gamma * E0. Gamma is 3.57142857.\n\nSo E = 3.57142857 *5.60536 GeV.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3 *5.60536 is 16.81608 GeV.\n\n0.57142857 *5.60536 = Let's compute 0.5 *5.60536=2.80268, 0.07142857 *5.60536\u22480.07142857 *5.60536.",
