The operator \u03c3_x in matrix form, when the basis is |\u2191\u27e9, |\u2193\u27e9, is [[0,1],[1,0]].

The bra vector would be the conjugate transpose, which is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], since the coefficients are real here. \n\nSo \u03c3_x matrix is:\n[0 1]\n[1 0]\n\nSo multiplying the bra (as a row vector) with \u03c3_x, then multiplying by the ket vector.

Let me compute that:\n\n(0.5)^2 = 0.25, so 0.25 *1 =0.25. The second term is (3/4)* (-1) because (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4. So 3/4 is 0.75, so 0.75*(-1) is -0.75. Adding those together gives 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. So \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 is -0.5. \n\nNow moving on to \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9. This is trickier because \u03c3_x isn't diagonal in the |\u2191\u27e9, |\u2193\u27e9 basis. The matrix for \u03c3_x in this basis is [[0,1],[1,0]].

The second part is 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) * \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 which is 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2)*1 = sqrt(3)/4.\n\nSecond term: (sqrt(3)/2) * [ 0.5 \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2) \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9 ]\n\nHere the second part (with \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9) is zero again. The first part is (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 *1 = (sqrt(3)/4).\n\nSo adding both terms:\n\nsqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866...",

That's correct. Because when you measure \u03c3_z in that state, the expectation is -0.5.\n\nFor \u03c3_x, the calculation was the inner product leading to sqrt(3)/2. That also seems correct. Because when you apply \u03c3_x to the state, which is (0.5, sqrt3/2), you get (sqrt3/2, 0.5). Then the inner product with (0.5, sqrt3/2) would be (0.5)(sqrt3/2) + (sqrt3/2)(0.5) = same as 2*(0.5*sqrt3/2) ) = sqrt3/2. So that's correct.\n\nSo 10*(-0.5) is indeed -5, and 5*(sqrt3/2) is ~4.330.

Let me confirm that.\n\nThe Pauli matrices in matrix form are:\n\n\u03c3_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], \u03c3_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nSo the expectation value of \u03c3_x is \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_x|\u03c8\u27e9. Let's write the state as a column vector [a; b], then the expectation value is [a* b*] [ [0 1], [1 0] ] [a ; b ] = a* b + b* a. Since this is (a b^* + b a^*). If a and b are real, then this is 2ab. So yes, for real coefficients, \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 = 2ab. \n\nAh, that's a good shortcut. So in this case, a is 0.5, and b is \u221a3/2. So 2*(0.5)*(\u221a3/2) = 2*(0.5)*(\u221a3/2) = (0.5)*(\u221a3) \u2248 0.8660. Which matches the previous result. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 is approximately 0.866. So the second term is 5*0.866 \u2248 4.33.\n\nAdding the two terms together: the first term from \u03c3_z was -5, and the second term is ~4.33. So total expectation value is -5 +4.33 \u2248 -0.67.",

Let me compute that:\n\n(0.5)^2 = 0.25, so 0.25 *1 =0.25. The second term is (3/4)* (-1) because (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4. So 3/4 is 0.75, so 0.75*(-1) is -0.75. Adding those together gives 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. So \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 is -0.5. \n\nNow moving on to \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9. This is trickier because \u03c3_x isn't diagonal in the |\u2191\u27e9, |\u2193\u27e9 basis. The matrix for \u03c3_x in this basis is [[0,1],[1,0]].

The second part is 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) * \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 which is 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2)*1 = sqrt(3)/4.\n\nSecond term: (sqrt(3)/2) * [ 0.5 \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2) \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9 ]\n\nHere the second part (with \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9) is zero again. The first part is (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 *1 = (sqrt(3)/4).\n\nSo adding both terms:\n\nsqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866...",

Let me compute that:\n\n(0.5)^2 = 0.25, so 0.25 *1 =0.25. The second term is (3/4)* (-1) because (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4. So 3/4 is 0.75, so 0.75*(-1) is -0.75.

This is trickier because \u03c3_x isn't diagonal in the |\u2191\u27e9, |\u2193\u27e9 basis. The matrix for \u03c3_x in this basis is [[0,1],[1,0]].

The second part is 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) * \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 which is 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2)*1 = sqrt(3)/4.\n\nSecond term: (sqrt(3)/2) * [ 0.5 \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2) \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9 ]\n\nHere the second part (with \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9) is zero again. The first part is (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 *1 = (sqrt(3)/4).\n\nSo adding both terms:\n\nsqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866...",

The probability for |\u2193\u27e9 is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.75, contributing 0.75*(-1). So total is 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. That matches. Okay, so that's correct. \n\nNow moving on to \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9. Hmm, \u03c3_x is a different operator. Its matrix representation is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So to compute \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9, we need to do the inner product of the state with \u03c3_x acting on the state. Let me write out the vectors. \n\nThe original state as a column vector is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. Applying \u03c3_x to this vector: \u03c3_x times the vector would be [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. Because \u03c3_x's matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so multiplying that with the vector gives first component (0*0.5 + 1*(sqrt(3)/2)) = sqrt(3)/2, and second component (1*0.5 + 0*(sqrt(3)/2)) =0.5. \n\nThen the inner product \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9 is the conjugate of the original vector (which is the same as the original since coefficients are real) dotted with this resulting vector. So:\n\nOriginal state coefficients [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] dotted with [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5] \n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3))/4 \n\nSecond term: (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 = (sqrt(3))/4 \n\nAdding those gives (sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660...",

So the expectation of \u03c3_z is (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. That's correct.\n\nThen \u03c3_x part: yes, the calculation of \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 is correct? Let me recheck the matrix multiplication.\n\nThe vector |\u03c8\u27e9 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. \n\n\u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so multiplying \u03c3_x to |\u03c8\u27e9 gives [ (sqrt(3)/2 ), 0.5]^T. \n\nThen \u27e8\u03c8| is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], so the inner product is 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5. Which equals sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2. That's correct. \n\nSo the expectation of \u03c3_x is indeed sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866. \n\nThen 10*(-0.5) = -5, and 5*(0.866) \u22484.33. Sum is -0.666..., which to one decimal is -0.7. So the answer should be C) -0.7. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is -0.7.",

Let me re-calculate \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. \n\nThe matrix multiplication steps again:\n\nThe state vector is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. \n\n\u03c3x is the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], so multiplying \u03c3x with \u03c8:\n\nFirst component: 0*0.5 +1*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/2 \n\nSecond component: 1*0.5 +0*(sqrt(3)/2) =0.5 \n\nThen, the inner product with [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] gives:\n\n0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 \n\nWhich is indeed (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866.
