In mutant1, that T becomes an A. \n\nSo changing the codon that includes position 8. Let's see which codon that is. \n\nCodons after the start:\n\nCodon 1: ATG (positions 1-3)\n\nCodon 2: TTT (4-6)\n\nCodon3: positions 7-9 \u2192 C T C \u2192 CTC (if position8 was T in original)\n\nIn mutant1, position8 is A, so codon3 would be C A C (positions7-9: C A C). So the codon3 becomes CAC instead of CTC.\n\nWhat's the amino acid for CAC? CAC is His (histidine), because the codons for His areCAC and CAT. The original was CTC, which is Leu (Leucine). So this is a missense mutation, changing the amino acid from Leu to His. \n\nSo that's a possible change, but not necessarily eliminating the protein's function.

Let's see:\n\nThe third codon (positions7-9) in original is C T C \u2192 CTC \u2192 Leu (CTC is Leu). \n\nIn mutant1, it's C T A \u2192 CTA \u2192 Leu (CTA is Leu). So still Leu. \n\nThe fourth codon (positions10-12): original G C T \u2192 GCT \u2192 Ala. \n\nMutant1's positions10-12: C (since after CTACGCTG, the 10th is C?), wait maybe I'm getting confused.",
