Let me compute that. 1e10 * 3.086e16 = 3.086e26 meters. \n\nSo, rearranging the formula to solve for D: D = \u03b8 * d. Plugging in the numbers: D \u2248 1.745e-19 rad * 3.086e26 m. Let me multiply those. \n\nFirst, 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = (1.745 * 3.086) * 10^( -19 +26 ) = Let's compute 1.745 *3.086. Let's see, 1.7 *3 is 5.1, so approx 1.745 *3.086 \u2248 around 5.38? Maybe more precise: 1.745 *3 = 5.235, 1.745*0.086 is about 0.15, so total \u22485.385. So, 5.385 * 10^7 meters. So D \u2248 5.385e7 meters. Therefore, the diameter is about 5e7 meters. So the radius R is half that, so R \u2248 2.7e7 meters. \n\nNow, the surface area A of a sphere is 4\u03c0R\u00b2. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, R squared: (2.7e7)^2 = (2.7)^2 *1e14 = 7.29 *1e14 = 7.29e14 m\u00b2. Multiply by 4\u03c0: 4 * 3.1416 \u224812.566. So 12.566 *7.29e14 \u2248 let's see, 12 *7.29 is 87.48, plus 0.566*7.29\u22484.12, so total \u224891.6e14 m\u00b2. So approximately 9.16e15 m\u00b2?",

Let's see, but maybe I don't need to go that way since I can proceed with the given data.\n\nNow, having the radius in meters, I can compute the surface area A = 4\u03c0r\u00b2.\n\nSo let's compute r squared first: (2.69e7 m)^2 = (2.69)^2 * 1e14 m\u00b2. 2.69 squared is approx 7.236, so 7.236e14 m\u00b2.

So 90.929e14 \u2192 9.0929e15 m\u00b2. So the area A is approximately 9.1e15 m\u00b2. \n\nNow, the entropy formula. Let me recall the exact formula. The entropy of a black hole is S = (k_B A)/(4 l_p\u00b2). Where l_p is the Planck length. \n\nPlanck length l_p is sqrt( (\u0127 G)/(c^3) ) \u2248 1.616e-35 meters. \n\nSo, plugging into the formula: \n\nFirst, let's compute the denominator 4 l_p squared. \n\nl_p squared is (1.616e-35)^2 \u2248 (2.611e-70) m\u00b2. \n\nSo 4 l_p\u00b2 is 4 * 2.611e-70 \u22481.0444e-69 m\u00b2. \n\nThen, A is 9.1e15 m\u00b2. \n\nSo S = (k_B * A) / (4 l_p\u00b2) = (k_B * 9.1e15) / (1.0444e-69) \n\nLet me compute the numerator and denominator separately. \n\nBut first, what's the value of k_B, Boltzmann's constant? It's approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. \n\nSo numerator: 1.38e-23 J/K * 9.1e15 = (1.38 *9.1) e(-23+15) J/K. Let's compute 1.38 *9.1: 1.38*9=12.42, 1.38*0.1=0.138 \u2192 total 12.558. So 12.558e-8 J/K. \n\nDenominator: 1.0444e-69 m\u00b2. \n\nSo S = (12.558e-8 J/K) / (1.0444e-69 m\u00b2?",

For example, when you look at the moon, its angular size is about 0.5 degrees, which is the diameter. So in this question, likely they are giving the angular diameter.

Let me compute that. 1e10 * 3.086e16 = 3.086e26 meters. \n\nSo, rearranging the formula to solve for D: D = \u03b8 * d. Plugging in the numbers: D \u2248 1.745e-19 rad * 3.086e26 m. Let me multiply those. \n\nFirst, 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = (1.745 * 3.086) * 10^( -19 +26 ) = Let's compute 1.745 *3.086. Let's see, 1.7 *3 is 5.1, so approx 1.745 *3.086 \u2248 around 5.38? Maybe more precise: 1.745 *3 = 5.235, 1.745*0.086 is about 0.15, so total \u22485.385. So, 5.385 * 10^7 meters. So D \u2248 5.385e7 meters. Therefore, the diameter is about 5e7 meters. So the radius R is half that, so R \u2248 2.7e7 meters. \n\nNow, the surface area A of a sphere is 4\u03c0R\u00b2. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, R squared: (2.7e7)^2 = (2.7)^2 *1e14 = 7.29 *1e14 = 7.29e14 m\u00b2. Multiply by 4\u03c0: 4 * 3.1416 \u224812.566. So 12.566 *7.29e14 \u2248 let's see, 12 *7.29 is 87.48, plus 0.566*7.29\u22484.12, so total \u224891.6e14 m\u00b2. So approximately 9.16e15 m\u00b2?",

Let's see, but maybe I don't need to go that way since I can proceed with the given data.\n\nNow, having the radius in meters, I can compute the surface area A = 4\u03c0r\u00b2.\n\nSo let's compute r squared first: (2.69e7 m)^2 = (2.69)^2 * 1e14 m\u00b2. 2.69 squared is approx 7.236, so 7.236e14 m\u00b2.

So 90.929e14 \u2192 9.0929e15 m\u00b2. So the area A is approximately 9.1e15 m\u00b2. \n\nNow, the entropy formula. Let me recall the exact formula. The entropy of a black hole is S = (k_B A)/(4 l_p\u00b2). Where l_p is the Planck length. \n\nPlanck length l_p is sqrt( (\u0127 G)/(c^3) ) \u2248 1.616e-35 meters. \n\nSo, plugging into the formula: \n\nFirst, let's compute the denominator 4 l_p squared. \n\nl_p squared is (1.616e-35)^2 \u2248 (2.611e-70) m\u00b2. \n\nSo 4 l_p\u00b2 is 4 * 2.611e-70 \u22481.0444e-69 m\u00b2. \n\nThen, A is 9.1e15 m\u00b2. \n\nSo S = (k_B * A) / (4 l_p\u00b2) = (k_B * 9.1e15) / (1.0444e-69) \n\nLet me compute the numerator and denominator separately. \n\nBut first, what's the value of k_B, Boltzmann's constant? It's approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. \n\nSo numerator: 1.38e-23 J/K * 9.1e15 = (1.38 *9.1) e(-23+15) J/K. Let's compute 1.38 *9.1: 1.38*9=12.42, 1.38*0.1=0.138 \u2192 total 12.558. So 12.558e-8 J/K. \n\nDenominator: 1.0444e-69 m\u00b2. \n\nSo S = (12.558e-8 J/K) / (1.0444e-69 m\u00b2?",

For example, when you look at the moon, its angular size is about 0.5 degrees, which is the diameter. So in this question, likely they are giving the angular diameter.
