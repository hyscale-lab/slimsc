The spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, so 0.2 * 2\u03c0R\u00b2 = 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2. So the total spotted area is 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2. \n\nNow, the brightness variation from spots is calculated by the difference in flux between the spots and the surrounding photosphere. The spots are cooler, so they emit less light. The amplitude of the light curve variation (delta F / F) would be the change in flux when the spots rotate in and out of view. \n\nThe formula for the flux from a star is F = \u03c3 T^4 * A, where \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, and A is the area. \n\nSo the total flux without spots would be F_total = \u03c3 Teff^4 * 4\u03c0R\u00b2. But with spots, part of the area has a lower temperature. The spotted area (0.4\u03c0R\u00b2) has temperature Teff - 1000K, which is 5000K here. The rest (4\u03c0R\u00b2 - 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2 = 3.6\u03c0R\u00b2) has Teff = 6000K.",

The maximum variation in brightness would occur when the spotted hemisphere is fully facing us (so all the spots are visible) versus when the opposite hemisphere (without spots) is facing us. So the amplitude of the variation is the difference between the two cases.\n\nThe effective temperature of the star is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so their temperature is 5000 K.

One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation.\"\n\nAh, so the spots are fixed on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots will rotate in and out of the observer's view. But the star is a sphere, so the visible hemisphere changes as it rotates. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer, the observer sees the spots, leading to a lower flux. When the non-spotted hemisphere is facing, flux is higher. So the amplitude of the variation is the difference between the flux when the spotted side is facing us and when it's not.\n\nTherefore, the maximum flux occurs when the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us. The minimum flux occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.\n\nCalculating those two fluxes:\n\nLet me denote F_max as when non-spotted hemisphere is visible, F_min when spotted is visible.\n\nF_max = flux from the non-spotted hemisphere (which is the entire non-spotted side, which is the other hemisphere which is not covered by spots at all) plus the non-spotted part of the other hemisphere?",

The wording says \"one hemisphere... with a filling factor of 20%\". So the spots cover 20% of the area of that one hemisphere. The other hemisphere is without spots. So the total area of spots on the entire star is 20% of one hemisphere's area. \n\nSo, the total surface area of the star is 4\u03c0R\u00b2. Each hemisphere is 2\u03c0R\u00b2.

The other hemisphere is all normal, 2\u03c0R\u00b2.\n\nSo when the star is rotating, the observer will see one hemisphere at a time. The maximum flux occurs when the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us (so all at 6000K), and the minimum occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing us (with 20% spots at 5000K and 80% at 6000K). The amplitude of the variation is the difference between these two.\n\nLet me compute the flux in each case.\n\nFirst, when the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us: All the visible area (which is a hemisphere) is at 6000K.

One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation.\"\n\nAh, so the spots are fixed on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots will rotate in and out of the observer's view. But the star is a sphere, so the visible hemisphere changes as it rotates. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer, the observer sees the spots, leading to a lower flux. When the non-spotted hemisphere is facing, flux is higher. So the amplitude of the variation is the difference between the flux when the spotted side is facing us and when it's not.\n\nTherefore, the maximum flux occurs when the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us. The minimum flux occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.\n\nCalculating those two fluxes:\n\nLet me denote F_max as when non-spotted hemisphere is visible, F_min when spotted is visible.\n\nF_max = flux from the non-spotted hemisphere (which is the entire non-spotted side, which is the other hemisphere which is not covered by spots at all) plus the non-spotted part of the other hemisphere?",

The wording says \"one hemisphere... with a filling factor of 20%\". So the spots cover 20% of the area of that one hemisphere. The other hemisphere is without spots. So the total area of spots on the entire star is 20% of one hemisphere's area. \n\nSo, the total surface area of the star is 4\u03c0R\u00b2. Each hemisphere is 2\u03c0R\u00b2.

Let me think. The total flux from the star is the sum of the flux from the non-spotted areas and the spots. \n\nThe flux from a star is proportional to the surface area times the blackbody flux. The blackbody flux (F) is proportional to T^4. So the flux from a region with temperature T is F = \u03c3 T^4, where \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. \n\nSo, let's model this. Let me denote the star's radius as R. Since the radius is the same as the Sun, but since we're dealing with ratios, maybe the radius cancels out. \n\nFirst, the total flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation.\"\n\nAh, so the spots are fixed on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots will rotate in and out of the observer's view. But the star is a sphere, so the visible hemisphere changes as it rotates. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer, the observer sees the spots, leading to a lower flux. When the non-spotted hemisphere is facing, flux is higher. So the amplitude of the variation is the difference between the flux when the spotted side is facing us and when it's not.\n\nTherefore, the maximum flux occurs when the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us. The minimum flux occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.\n\nCalculating those two fluxes:\n\nLet me denote F_max as when non-spotted hemisphere is visible, F_min when spotted is visible.\n\nF_max = flux from the non-spotted hemisphere (which is the entire non-spotted side, which is the other hemisphere which is not covered by spots at all) plus the non-spotted part of the other hemisphere?",

The wording says \"one hemisphere... with a filling factor of 20%\". So the spots cover 20% of the area of that one hemisphere. The other hemisphere is without spots. So the total area of spots on the entire star is 20% of one hemisphere's area. \n\nSo, the total surface area of the star is 4\u03c0R\u00b2. Each hemisphere is 2\u03c0R\u00b2.

So amplitude in terms of depth would be (F_max - F_min)/F_max.

So we set this equal to the amplitude (since the question says \"produce the same amplitude signal\").",

So when the star rotates, the spots will rotate in and out of the observer's view. But the star is a sphere, so the visible hemisphere changes as it rotates. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer, the observer sees the spots, leading to a lower flux. When the non-spotted hemisphere is facing, flux is higher. So the amplitude of the variation is the difference between the flux when the spotted side is facing us and when it's not.\n\nTherefore, the maximum flux occurs when the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us. The minimum flux occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.\n\nCalculating those two fluxes:\n\nLet me denote F_max as when non-spotted hemisphere is visible, F_min when spotted is visible.\n\nF_max = flux from the non-spotted hemisphere (which is the entire non-spotted side, which is the other hemisphere which is not covered by spots at all) plus the non-spotted part of the other hemisphere?",
          "text2": "Wait, but the problem states that \"one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%\". Hmm, maybe the entire star's surface has spots, but only on one hemisphere? Or the spots are only on one hemisphere, and the filling factor there is 20% of that hemisphere's area? The wording says \"one hemisphere... with a filling factor of 20%\". So the spots cover 20% of the area of that one hemisphere. The other hemisphere is without spots. So the total area of spots on the entire star is 20% of one hemisphere's area. \n\nSo, the total surface area of the star is 4\u03c0R\u00b2. Each hemisphere is 2\u03c0R\u00b2. The spotted hemisphere has 0.2 * 2\u03c0R\u00b2 = 0.4 \u03c0R\u00b2 area in spots, and 0.8 * 2\u03c0R\u00b2 = 1.6 \u03c0R\u00b2 at normal temp. The other hemisphere is all normal, 2\u03c0R\u00b2.\n\nSo when the star is rotating, the observer will see one hemisphere at a time. The maximum flux occurs when the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us (so all at 6000K), and the minimum occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing us (with 20% spots at 5000K and 80% at 6000K). The amplitude of the variation is the difference between these two.\n\nLet me compute the flux in each case.\n\nFirst, when the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us: All the visible area (which is a hemisphere) is at 6000K. The flux from that side is proportional to (T)^4 times the area.

One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation.\"\n\nAh, so the spots are fixed on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots will rotate in and out of the observer's view. But the star is a sphere, so the visible hemisphere changes as it rotates. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer, the observer sees the spots, leading to a lower flux. When the non-spotted hemisphere is facing, flux is higher. So the amplitude of the variation is the difference between the flux when the spotted side is facing us and when it's not.\n\nTherefore, the maximum flux occurs when the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us. The minimum flux occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.\n\nCalculating those two fluxes:\n\nLet me denote F_max as when non-spotted hemisphere is visible, F_min when spotted is visible.\n\nF_max = flux from the non-spotted hemisphere (which is the entire non-spotted side, which is the other hemisphere which is not covered by spots at all) plus the non-spotted part of the other hemisphere?",

The wording says \"one hemisphere... with a filling factor of 20%\". So the spots cover 20% of the area of that one hemisphere. The other hemisphere is without spots. So the total area of spots on the entire star is 20% of one hemisphere's area. \n\nSo, the total surface area of the star is 4\u03c0R\u00b2. Each hemisphere is 2\u03c0R\u00b2.

One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation.\"\n\nAh, so the spots are fixed on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots will rotate in and out of the observer's view. But the star is a sphere, so the visible hemisphere changes as it rotates. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer, the observer sees the spots, leading to a lower flux. When the non-spotted hemisphere is facing, flux is higher. So the amplitude of the variation is the difference between the flux when the spotted side is facing us and when it's not.\n\nTherefore, the maximum flux occurs when the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us. The minimum flux occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.\n\nCalculating those two fluxes:\n\nLet me denote F_max as when non-spotted hemisphere is visible, F_min when spotted is visible.\n\nF_max = flux from the non-spotted hemisphere (which is the entire non-spotted side, which is the other hemisphere which is not covered by spots at all) plus the non-spotted part of the other hemisphere?",

The wording says \"one hemisphere... with a filling factor of 20%\". So the spots cover 20% of the area of that one hemisphere. The other hemisphere is without spots. So the total area of spots on the entire star is 20% of one hemisphere's area. \n\nSo, the total surface area of the star is 4\u03c0R\u00b2. Each hemisphere is 2\u03c0R\u00b2.

The amplitude of the light curve variation (delta F / F) would be the change in flux when the spots rotate in and out of view. \n\nThe formula for the flux from a star is F = \u03c3 T^4 * A, where \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, and A is the area. \n\nSo the total flux without spots would be F_total = \u03c3 Teff^4 * 4\u03c0R\u00b2.

As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation.\"\n\nAh, so the spots are fixed on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots will rotate in and out of the observer's view. But the star is a sphere, so the visible hemisphere changes as it rotates. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer, the observer sees the spots, leading to a lower flux. When the non-spotted hemisphere is facing, flux is higher.

The wording says \"one hemisphere... with a filling factor of 20%\". So the spots cover 20% of the area of that one hemisphere. The other hemisphere is without spots. So the total area of spots on the entire star is 20% of one hemisphere's area. \n\nSo, the total surface area of the star is 4\u03c0R\u00b2. Each hemisphere is 2\u03c0R\u00b2.
