Let me clarify:\n\nThe star's total flux without any spots is F_normal = \u03c3Teff^4.\n\nBut when the spots are on one hemisphere, the star's surface is 10% spots (as we calculated earlier) and 90% normal.\n\nSo the star's average flux is F_avg = 0.9 * F_normal + 0.1 * F_spot.\n\nBut when the star rotates so that the hemisphere with spots is facing us, the observed flux is F_avg. When the other hemisphere (which has no spots) is facing us, the observed flux is F_normal.\n\nSo the maximum brightness is F_normal, and the minimum is F_avg.\n\nSo the amplitude of the brightness variation (the dip) is (F_normal - F_avg)/F_normal.\n\nWhich is (F_normal - (0.9 F_normal + 0.1 F_spot)) / F_normal.\n\nWhich is (F_normal - 0.9 F_normal - 0.1 F_spot ) / F_normal.\n\n= (0.1 F_normal - 0.1 F_spot ) / F_normal.\n\n= 0.1 (F_normal - F_spot ) / F_normal.\n\n= 0.1 (1 - F_spot / F_normal )\n\nWe calculated F_spot/F_normal as (5000/6000)^4 \u2248 0.48225.\n\nSo 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.\n\nMultiply by 0.1: 0.051775, so the dip is about 5.1775%.\n\nSo the dip amplitude is 5.1775%.\n\nSo if a planet were to cause the same dip, the planet's area would need to be (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775.\n\nSo Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) \u2248 0.2276.\n\nBut the options don't have this.
