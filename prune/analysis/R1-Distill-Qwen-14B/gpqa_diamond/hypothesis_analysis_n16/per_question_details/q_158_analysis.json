The mutant can't form dimers (if their domain is non-functional). So the total number of functional dimers would be half of what it would be in wild-type. But this is a recessive effect because you need two copies to see a significant loss. However, the question says that Y is dominant-negative, so this scenario can't be right. \n\nAh! That's a key point. If the mutation were recessive, then heterozygotes would have half the normal dimers, which would be a partial loss, but not a dominant effect. Since Y is dominant-negative, the presence of even one mutant allele must significantly reduce function beyond just a quantitative decrease. \n\nTherefore, the mutant must be interfering actively. \n\nThe only way this can happen is if the mutant binds to the wild-type, preventing them from forming functional dimers. \n\nSuppose the mutant can bind to wild-type but not to itself. So each mutant binds a wild-type, preventing them from forming proper homodimers. Thus, in a heterozygote with 50% mutant and 50% wild-type, all the wild-type is tied up with mutant, so no functional dimers.

Since in heterozygotes you have half mutant and half wild, the number of functional dimers would be (wild-type)^2/(total)^2, leading to a significant reduction, hence the dominant-negative effect. \n\nIn this scenario, the molecular problem is that the mutant can form dimers (with wild-type), but those dimers don't function.

The mutant has a defective dimerization domain. \n\nIn a heterozygous cell, the proteins are 50% wild-type and 50% mutant. The wild-type can form homodimers with other wild-type proteins. The mutant can't form dimers (if their domain is non-functional). So the total number of functional dimers would be half of what it would be in wild-type. But this is a recessive effect because you need two copies to see a significant loss. However, the question says that Y is dominant-negative, so this scenario can't be right. \n\nAh! That's a key point. If the mutation were recessive, then heterozygotes would have half the normal dimers, which would be a partial loss, but not a dominant effect. Since Y is dominant-negative, the presence of even one mutant allele must significantly reduce function beyond just a quantitative decrease. \n\nTherefore, the mutant must be interfering actively. \n\nThe only way this can happen is if the mutant binds to the wild-type, preventing them from forming functional dimers. \n\nSuppose the mutant can bind to wild-type but not to itself. So each mutant binds a wild-type, preventing them from forming proper homodimers. Thus, in a heterozygote with 50% mutant and 50% wild-type, all the wild-type is tied up with mutant, so no functional dimers. This would result in a complete loss of function, hence a dominant-negative effect. \n\nIn this case, the molecular defect is that the mutant binds to wild-type and prevents dimerization (since the complex is non-functional). The proteins are still present, but can't form functional dimers. \n\nThe options don't mention this directly, but looking at the choices again: \n\nOption D: protein aggregation and loss.

But that would be a recessive mutation because you need two mutant alleles to abolish dimerization. But the question states that mutation Y is dominant-negative, so the heterozygous state (having one mutant allele) shows the phenotype. \n\nAh, so the key is that the mutant is dominant because it interferes with the wild-type. So the mutant must be able to bind to the wild-type and prevent it from working. \n\nIn that case, the mutant might form a dimer with the wild-type, but the dimer is non-functional. So the presence of the mutant uses up some wild-type proteins in non-functional dimers, thereby reducing the total functional dimers (which would be only the wild-type dimer pairs). Since in heterozygotes you have half mutant and half wild, the number of functional dimers would be (wild-type)^2/(total)^2, leading to a significant reduction, hence the dominant-negative effect. \n\nIn this scenario, the molecular problem is that the mutant can form dimers (with wild-type), but those dimers don't function.

But the question says that Y is dominant-negative, so maybe the mutant is interfering more than just not forming dimers. \n\nThe key here is the dominant-negative effect. Dominant-negative usually means that the mutant subunit interferes with the wild-type function. So the mechanism is that the mutant forms dimers, but the dimer is non-functional.

For example, maybe the dimerization domain is altered so that when the mutant binds to wild-type, the resulting dimer can't enter the nucleus or can't bind DNA. \n\nIn that case, the presence of the mutant subunit would lead to formation of non-functional dimers (mutant plus wild-type), thereby reducing the number of functional wild-type dimers.

Let's see: the normal process requires the transcription factor to dimerize. If the mutation is in the dimerization domain, a mutant might not dimerize properly. But if it can still bind to wild-type, forming a heterodimer that can't function. So in a heterozygous individual, half the subunits are mutant and half normal. The normal subunits can form homodimers (wild-type pairs) but also form heterodimers (with mutant). The heterodimers might not be able to activate transcription. The total number of functional dimers would be only the homodimers. Since each protein has 50% chance to pair, the actual number would be less.

That's a key point. If the mutation were recessive, then heterozygotes would have half the normal dimers, which would be a partial loss, but not a dominant effect. Since Y is dominant-negative, the presence of even one mutant allele must significantly reduce function beyond just a quantitative decrease. \n\nTherefore, the mutant must be interfering actively. \n\nThe only way this can happen is if the mutant binds to the wild-type, preventing them from forming functional dimers. \n\nSuppose the mutant can bind to wild-type but not to itself. So each mutant binds a wild-type, preventing them from forming proper homodimers.

The mutant has a defective dimerization domain. \n\nIn a heterozygous cell, the proteins are 50% wild-type and 50% mutant. The wild-type can form homodimers with other wild-type proteins. The mutant can't form dimers (if their domain is non-functional). So the total number of functional dimers would be half of what it would be in wild-type. But this is a recessive effect because you need two copies to see a significant loss. However, the question says that Y is dominant-negative, so this scenario can't be right. \n\nAh! That's a key point. If the mutation were recessive, then heterozygotes would have half the normal dimers, which would be a partial loss, but not a dominant effect. Since Y is dominant-negative, the presence of even one mutant allele must significantly reduce function beyond just a quantitative decrease. \n\nTherefore, the mutant must be interfering actively. \n\nThe only way this can happen is if the mutant binds to the wild-type, preventing them from forming functional dimers. \n\nSuppose the mutant can bind to wild-type but not to itself. So each mutant binds a wild-type, preventing them from forming proper homodimers. Thus, in a heterozygote with 50% mutant and 50% wild-type, all the wild-type is tied up with mutant, so no functional dimers.

But that would be a recessive mutation because you need two mutant alleles to abolish dimerization. But the question states that mutation Y is dominant-negative, so the heterozygous state (having one mutant allele) shows the phenotype. \n\nAh, so the key is that the mutant is dominant because it interferes with the wild-type.

So the presence of the mutant uses up some wild-type proteins in non-functional dimers, thereby reducing the total functional dimers (which would be only the wild-type dimer pairs). Since in heterozygotes you have half mutant and half wild, the number of functional dimers would be (wild-type)^2/(total)^2, leading to a significant reduction, hence the dominant-negative effect. \n\nIn this scenario, the molecular problem is that the mutant can form dimers (with wild-type), but those dimers don't function.

The mutant has a defective dimerization domain. \n\nIn a heterozygous cell, the proteins are 50% wild-type and 50% mutant. The wild-type can form homodimers with other wild-type proteins. The mutant can't form dimers (if their domain is non-functional). So the total number of functional dimers would be half of what it would be in wild-type. But this is a recessive effect because you need two copies to see a significant loss. However, the question says that Y is dominant-negative, so this scenario can't be right. \n\nAh! That's a key point. If the mutation were recessive, then heterozygotes would have half the normal dimers, which would be a partial loss, but not a dominant effect. Since Y is dominant-negative, the presence of even one mutant allele must significantly reduce function beyond just a quantitative decrease. \n\nTherefore, the mutant must be interfering actively. \n\nThe only way this can happen is if the mutant binds to the wild-type, preventing them from forming functional dimers. \n\nSuppose the mutant can bind to wild-type but not to itself. So each mutant binds a wild-type, preventing them from forming proper homodimers. Thus, in a heterozygote with 50% mutant and 50% wild-type, all the wild-type is tied up with mutant, so no functional dimers. This would result in a complete loss of function, hence a dominant-negative effect. \n\nIn this case, the molecular defect is that the mutant binds to wild-type and prevents dimerization (since the complex is non-functional).

But that would be a recessive mutation because you need two mutant alleles to abolish dimerization. But the question states that mutation Y is dominant-negative, so the heterozygous state (having one mutant allele) shows the phenotype. \n\nAh, so the key is that the mutant is dominant because it interferes with the wild-type. So the mutant must be able to bind to the wild-type and prevent it from working. \n\nIn that case, the mutant might form a dimer with the wild-type, but the dimer is non-functional. So the presence of the mutant uses up some wild-type proteins in non-functional dimers, thereby reducing the total functional dimers (which would be only the wild-type dimer pairs). Since in heterozygotes you have half mutant and half wild, the number of functional dimers would be (wild-type)^2/(total)^2, leading to a significant reduction, hence the dominant-negative effect. \n\nIn this scenario, the molecular problem is that the mutant can form dimers (with wild-type), but those dimers don't function.

Let's see: the normal process requires the transcription factor to dimerize. If the mutation is in the dimerization domain, a mutant might not dimerize properly. But if it can still bind to wild-type, forming a heterodimer that can't function. So in a heterozygous individual, half the subunits are mutant and half normal.

So the effect would be similar to having only one functional allele, which is recessive, not dominant. So that can't be the case. \n\nTherefore, the dominant-negative effect must be due to the mutant interfering with the wild-type in a way that even a small amount of mutant subunit can inhibit the wild-type. \n\nSo the mutant must form dimers with wild-type, but those dimers are non-functional.

That's a key point. If the mutation were recessive, then heterozygotes would have half the normal dimers, which would be a partial loss, but not a dominant effect.

The question asks for the molecular phenotype observed. \n\nNone of the options mention functional dimers being non-functional. Let's look again:\n\nOption D: protein aggregation and loss-of-function. If the dimer formed with Y is prone to aggregation, then the proteins would clump and can't work. That's possible.",

That's a key point. If the mutation were recessive, then heterozygotes would have half the normal dimers, which would be a partial loss, but not a dominant effect. Since Y is dominant-negative, the presence of even one mutant allele must significantly reduce function beyond just a quantitative decrease. \n\nTherefore, the mutant must be interfering actively. \n\nThe only way this can happen is if the mutant binds to the wild-type, preventing them from forming functional dimers. \n\nSuppose the mutant can bind to wild-type but not to itself.

But that would be a recessive mutation because you need two mutant alleles to abolish dimerization. But the question states that mutation Y is dominant-negative, so the heterozygous state (having one mutant allele) shows the phenotype. \n\nAh, so the key is that the mutant is dominant because it interferes with the wild-type.
