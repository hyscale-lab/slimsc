Specifically, reaction of 1,2-dibromopropane with KOH would give propene via E2 elimination. Because the two halogens are on adjacent carbons, the elimination leads to the loss of both halogens and the formation of a double bond between those carbons.

Let me reassess the steps again carefully.\n\nStarting over:\n\nCompound A: C3H6 (propene) \u2192 bromination \u2192 B (1,2-dibromopropane).\n\nB (BrCH2CH2Br) with alcoholic KOH \u2192 elimination. \n\nThe elimination would first remove one Br and a hydrogen to form CH2=CHCH2Br (1-bromopropene). Then another elimination removes the remaining Br and a hydrogen to form propene again. So C is propene again, same as A. That can't be right.",
          "text2": "Wait, let's try that path:\n\nA is propene (C3H6). Bromination gives B: 1,2-dibromopropane (C3H4Br2).\n\nStep 2: B treated with alcoholic KOH \u2192 elimination. Let's say that the two Br's are removed as HBr. The elimination reaction would require two steps? Or maybe it's done in one. Let me think: The base abstracts a proton from the carbon adjacent to one Br, causing the Br to leave, forming a double bond. Then, another elimination removes the other Br. So first elimination gives CH2=CHCH2Br (1-bromopropene?), then another elimination (if possible) would abstract a proton from the CH2Br group, causing the Br to leave, forming CH2=CHCH2 (propene again).",
