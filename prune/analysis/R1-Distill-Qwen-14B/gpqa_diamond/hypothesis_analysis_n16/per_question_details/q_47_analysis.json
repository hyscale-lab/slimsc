The doublets suggest coupling with neighboring protons. Let's see the possible structures.\n\nThe molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's count the carbons. The ethoxy group is -OCH2CH3 (which is 2 carbons), so the remaining structure would be a benzene ring plus some other groups. The formula has 9 carbons. So benzene (6) plus the ethoxy (2) gives 8, so one more carbon. The other groups include the N and O2. The N could be part of an amide or amine. The O2 could be part of the ethoxy (one O) and another oxygen, perhaps from a carboxylic acid derivative. \n\nLooking at the IR: the carbonyl at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 suggests an ester (since esters have C=O around 1730-1750, but 1720 is near that range). Amides have lower C=O (~1650-1700).",

The phenyl group with 4-ethoxy substituent would have protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to ethoxy) and 3 and 5 (meta). The ethoxy group is electron-donating, so the adjacent protons (ortho) would be lower ppm. But the formamide's carbonyl might influence the aromatic protons. The NMR peaks here might be different. Let me think of the aromatic protons. The benzene ring with 4-ethoxy would have protons at 2,3,5,6. The ethoxy is at position 4. The formamide group is attached to the nitrogen, which is connected to the phenyl's position (say position 1). So the substituents would be at position 1 (the formamide's NH group) and position 4 (ethoxy). The protons would then be split accordingly. The chemical shifts might not give the 7.0 and 8.0 peaks as in the given data. Also, the formamide's carbonyl would be at around 1680 cm\u207b\u00b9 (amide carbonyl), which would fit with the 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 given?",

Therefore, option A is out. \n\nSo the carbonyl at 1720 is an ester, so the structure must have an ester group. \n\nThus, option D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate) has an ester, while option B and C? \n\nOption B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. \n\nFormamide is RCONH2 where R is formyl (CHO).",
