          "text1": "Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the variables. Let me think again. Let's suppose the star density is n (stars per volume). Then the number of stars between d and d + dd is n * 4\u03c0 d\u00b2 dd. \n\nExpressing in terms of p =1/d, so d =1/p, then dd = - (1/p\u00b2) dp. \n\nThe number of stars in the interval dp is n *4\u03c0 (1/p\u00b2) * (1/p\u00b2 dp) ) = n *4\u03c0/(p^4) dp. \n\nTherefore, the number per unit plx (i.e., per dp) is proportional to 1/p^4. So yes, the number density in terms of plx is N(p) = k/p^4, where k is a constant of proportionality. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.",
          "text2": "Alternatively, let's think of the number of stars in a parallax interval from p to p + dp. Since p = 1/r, the corresponding distance interval is from r to r - dr (since increasing p means decreasing r). The number of stars in that distance interval is the volume element (4\u03c0r\u00b2 dr) times the density (which is constant, since uniform). \n\nTo express this in terms of p, since r = 1/p, dr = - (1/p\u00b2) dp. So the absolute value dr = dp / p\u00b2. The volume element 4\u03c0r\u00b2 dr becomes 4\u03c0 (1/p\u00b2) * (dp/p\u00b2) ) = 4\u03c0 dp / p^4. Therefore, the number per unit p is proportional to 1/p^4. \n\nSo the correct answer should be A.",
