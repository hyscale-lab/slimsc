The antiderivative is ln|1+x|. Evaluated from 1 to 3, that's ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So that integral is ln(2).\n\nSecond integral: \u222bdx from 1 to 3 is just 3 -1 = 2.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\na\u00b2 * ln(2) + 0.25 * 2 = 1\n\nSimplify the second term: 0.25*2 = 0.5. So:\n\na\u00b2 * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nSubtract 0.5 from both sides:\n\na\u00b2 * ln(2) = 0.5\n\nSo then, a\u00b2 = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nCompute ln(2): approximately 0.6931. So 0.5 divided by 0.6931 is roughly 0.719. \n\nTherefore, a is the square root of that value. Let me compute sqrt(0.719). The square root of 0.719 is approximately 0.848, which is close to 0.85. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is 0.85, which would be the correct answer. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, modulus squared is correct. The integrals: the first integral of 1/(1+x) from 1 to 3 is indeed ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2). The second integral is 2. So the equation is correct. Then solving for a\u00b2 gives 0.5/ln(2). Let me compute that again. 0.5 divided by 0.69314718056. \n\n0.5 / 0.693147 \u2248 0.719. Square root of that is sqrt(0.719) \u2248 0.848, which rounds to 0.85. So option B. \n\nHmm, so the answer should be B) 0.85. Let me check if there was any miscalculation.",
