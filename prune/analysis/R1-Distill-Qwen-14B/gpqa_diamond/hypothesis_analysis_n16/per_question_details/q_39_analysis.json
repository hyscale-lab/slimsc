Let me write that down as \u03c8(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] - (0.5)i.\n\nSo the wave function is a complex function. To find the probability, I need to compute |\u03c8(x)|\u00b2, which is \u03c8*(x) multiplied by \u03c8(x), where * denotes the complex conjugate.\n\nSo \u03c8*(x) would be [a/(sqrt(1+x))] + 0.5i.\n\nMultiplying \u03c8 and \u03c8*, the cross terms (the imaginary parts) would involve i and -i. Let me compute that:\n\n\u03c8\u03c8* = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (a/(sqrt(1+x)))(0.5i) + (a/(sqrt(1+x)))(-0.5i) + (0.5i)(-0.5i).\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: [a\u00b2/(1+x)].\n\nSecond term: (a * 0.5i)/(sqrt(1+x)).\n\nThird term: (-a * 0.5i)/(sqrt(1+x)).\n\nFourth term: (-0.25 i^2) \u2192 since i^2=-1, this becomes +0.25.\n\nThe second and third terms are each other's negatives, so they cancel out. So overall, \u03c8\u03c8* = [a\u00b2/(1+x)] + 0.25.",
