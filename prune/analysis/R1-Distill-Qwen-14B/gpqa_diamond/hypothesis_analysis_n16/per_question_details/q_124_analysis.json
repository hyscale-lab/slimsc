Let me call the exponent for gamma=20 as x: x = (30)/(c *20 * tau_0). Then P1 = exp(-x) = 1/3. So -x = ln(1/3) => x = ln(3). \n\nTherefore, (30)/(c *20 * tau_0) = ln(3). \n\nSo solving for (30)/(c * tau_0) = 20 * ln(3). \n\nNow, for the new gamma (let's call it gamma2), we have:\n\nP2 = exp( - [30/(c * gamma2 * tau_0) ]) = 2/3.\n\nThe exponent here is [30/(c * gamma2 * tau_0)] = [30/(c tau_0)] / gamma2.\n\nBut from before, 30/(c tau_0) is 20 * ln(3). Therefore, substituting:\n\nExponent becomes (20 * ln3)/gamma2. \n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nexp( - (20 * ln3)/gamma2 ) = 2/3.\n\nTake natural logarithm on both sides:\n\n- (20 * ln3)/gamma2 = ln(2/3).\n\nSo rearranged:\n\ngamma2 = - (20 * ln3) / ln(2/3).\n\nLet me compute that. Let's compute the numerator and denominator:\n\nln(3) is approximately 1.0986 (since ln(3) \u2248 1.0986), and ln(2/3) is ln(0.666...) which is negative. Let me see: ln(2/3) = ln2 - ln3 \u2248 0.6931 - 1.0986 \u2248 -0.4055.\n\nSo numerator is 20 * 1.0986 \u2248 21.972.\n\nDenominator is ln(2/3) \u2248 -0.4055.\n\nTherefore, gamma2 \u2248 21.972 / 0.4055 \u2248 let me calculate that.\n\n21.972 divided by 0.4055. Let's see:\n\n0.4055 * 54 = approx 0.4055*50=20.275 and 0.4055*4=1.622 \u2192 total 21.897, which is close to 21.972. So 54 would give approx 21.897. The actual value is 21.972 / 0.4055 \u2248 54.17.

Let me call the exponent for gamma=20 as x: x = (30)/(c *20 * tau_0). Then P1 = exp(-x) = 1/3. So -x = ln(1/3) => x = ln(3). \n\nTherefore, (30)/(c *20 * tau_0) = ln(3). \n\nSo solving for (30)/(c * tau_0) = 20 * ln(3). \n\nNow, for the new gamma (let's call it gamma2), we have:\n\nP2 = exp( - [30/(c * gamma2 * tau_0) ]) = 2/3.\n\nThe exponent here is [30/(c * gamma2 * tau_0)] = [30/(c tau_0)] / gamma2.\n\nBut from before, 30/(c tau_0) is 20 * ln(3). Therefore, substituting:\n\nExponent becomes (20 * ln3)/gamma2. \n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nexp( - (20 * ln3)/gamma2 ) = 2/3.\n\nTake natural logarithm on both sides:\n\n- (20 * ln3)/gamma2 = ln(2/3).\n\nSo rearranged:\n\ngamma2 = - (20 * ln3) / ln(2/3).\n\nLet me compute that.
