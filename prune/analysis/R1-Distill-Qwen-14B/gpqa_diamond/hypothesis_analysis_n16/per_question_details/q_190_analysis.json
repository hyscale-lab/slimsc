The pKa of propanoic acid is around 4.88. So the propionate is a weaker base than hydroxide, because the acid is stronger (since lower pKa means stronger acid, so conjugate base is weaker).\n\n4. Methanol (CH3OH) is a neutral molecule here. Its pKa is around 15-16, so its conjugate base (methoxide) would be similar in basicity to the alkoxide. But methanol itself is a neutral nucleophile, so perhaps less nucleophilic than the anions.\n\n5. Ethanethiolate (CH3CH2S-). The conjugate acid is ethanethiol (H2S's derivative). The pKa of H2S is around 7, so the thiolate is a stronger base than hydroxide. Because H2S is weaker acid than water (since water has higher pKa than H2S?),",
