Here, the 50 seconds is the time in the ejecta's frame, so for the events (start and end) happening at the same place in the ejecta's frame, so \u03c4 is the proper time.

Let me read again: \"From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s (0.2c) towards it.\" So in the ejecta's frame, the center is approaching them at 0.2c. Therefore, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta must be moving towards the center at 0.2c. Because in the rest frame of the galaxy, the ejecta's velocity is the same as the velocity of the galaxy's center in the ejecta's frame, but in the opposite direction?",

Because if that's the case, then the answer would be distance in the Galaxy's frame is v * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame. But the time given is in the ejecta's frame. Ah, right! Because time dilation comes into play here.\n\nSo the problem is that the 50 seconds is the time measured in the ejecta's frame, but the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame would depend on the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame. Since the ejecta's clock is moving, the time in the Galaxy's frame would be longer due to time dilation. Let's see:\n\nFirst, compute gamma. The speed v is 60,000 km/s, which is 6e4 km/s. Let me convert that to m/s to use in gamma. 60,000 km/s is 6e7 m/s. The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So v/c = 6e7 / 3e8 = 0.2. So v = 0.2c.\n\nTherefore gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1/0.98 \u2248 1.020620726. Hmm, so gamma is approximately 1.0206.",

So in galaxy's frame, ejecta's speed is 60,000 km/s towards the center. \n\nBut then, to find the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame during the time that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, we need to account for time dilation. \n\nSo first, compute gamma.

For example, if in the ejecta's frame, two events (like a clock starting and stopping) happen at the same place, the time between them is \u03c4. The time between those events in the stationary (Galaxy) frame is \u0394t = \u03b3 \u03c4. \n\nSo if in the ejecta's frame, the time between the events (the 50 seconds) is \u03c4, then in the Galaxy's frame, it's \u0394t = gamma * \u03c4. \n\nSo the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame would be v * \u0394t = v * gamma * \u03c4. \n\nSo, yes, that gives v * gamma * \u03c4. \n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nv = 6e4 km/s\n\ngamma \u2248 1.02062\n\n\u03c4 = 50 s\n\nSo 6e4 * 1.02062 *50 = 6e4 *50 *1.02062 \n\n6e4 *50 is 3e6. Then 3e6 *1.02062 is 3,061,860, which rounds to 3,060,000 (option D). \n\nTherefore, I think D is the correct answer.",

So the time in the Galaxy's frame would be t = gamma * tau.\n\nSo the time in the Galaxy's frame is t = gamma * 50 seconds.

The proper time is the time measured in the frame where the event happens at the same place. Here, the 50 seconds is the time in the ejecta's frame, so for the events (start and end) happening at the same place in the ejecta's frame, so \u03c4 is the proper time. Therefore, the time in the galaxy's frame would be t = \u03b3\u03c4, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor.\n\nBut first, let's compute \u03b3. The speed v is 6e4 km/s. Let's convert that to meters per second for easier handling with c. 60,000 km/s is 6e7 m/s (since 1 km is 1e3 m). The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So v/c is 6e7 / 3e8 = 0.2.

The problem is asking for the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's reference frame. So the time in the ejecta's frame (proper time?) is 50 seconds, but in the galaxy's frame, the time elapsed would be longer due to time dilation. \n\nTherefore, we need to compute the time in the galaxy's frame corresponding to 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, then multiply by the ejecta's speed in the galaxy's frame. \n\nSo first, find the gamma factor.

So in the ejecta's frame, their own clock shows 50 seconds. The distance the ejecta moves in the Galaxy's frame would be the velocity in the Galaxy's frame multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame. \n\nTherefore, the key is to find the time in the Galaxy's frame corresponding to the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, then multiply by the velocity. \n\nBecause in the Galaxy's frame, the time that passes is longer due to time dilation, so the time t_galaxy = gamma * t_ejecta. \n\nThen the distance is v * t_galaxy.",
