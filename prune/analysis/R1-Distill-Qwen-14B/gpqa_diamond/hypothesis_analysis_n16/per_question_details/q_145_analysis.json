So the group attached in that direction has a double bond at C3, making it different from the direction towards C1, which doesn't. Therefore, those two substituents are different. So the four groups on C2 are indeed all different. Therefore, C2 is another chiral center.\n\nHmm, that's a possibility. But I need to be careful here. Let me think of another way: if you rotate the molecule such that the two substituents (the direction to C1 and C3) are swapped, would that change the molecule? Since the substituent towards C3 has the double bond, swapping with the C1 side would create a different configuration. Therefore, these are different groups.

Because C3 is part of a double bond, the structure around C2 might have restricted rotation, but the chirality depends on the substituents.
