So the spin operator S is usually (\u0127/2) \u03c3, but in the Hamiltonian given here, it's written as \u03b5 \u03c3\u22c5n, so the eigenvalues of \u03c3\u22c5n are \u00b11, so H's eigenvalues are \u00b1\u03b5.

So if the \u03c3 here are the regular Pauli matrices (without the \u210f/2), then their eigenvalues are \u00b11. Hence the eigenvalues of H would be \u00b1\u03b5. But if the problem's \u03c3 includes the \u210f/2 factor, then that would change things. \n\nHmm, the question says \"components of \u03c3 are the Pauli spin matrices\". The standard Pauli matrices are indeed the 2x2 matrices without the \u210f/2. The spin operator S is (\u210f/2)\u03c3. So if the Hamiltonian here is using \u03c3 as the Pauli matrices themselves, then their eigenvalues are \u00b11, so H's eigenvalues would be \u03b5*(\u00b11) = \u00b1\u03b5. So option B. \n\nBut let me check the options again. Option C is \u00b1\u03b5 \u210f/2, which would be the case if the Hamiltonian was written as \u03b5 times S (the spin operator with the \u210f/2 factor). But according to the problem's H, it's just \u03b5 multiplied by \u03c3\u00b7n, so unless there's a factor I'm missing here.",
