For example, nitro groups are meta directing, so the major product would be the meta isomer, so the para isomer's yield is minimal. \n\nBut maybe the problem is simpler. Let me think again of each substituent's directing effect and whether they favor ortho/para or meta, and thus the para isomer's yield.\n\nLet me list each substance with their directing effect and the expected major product's position:\n\n1. Toluene (methyl): activating, ortho/para directing. So the bromine can go ortho or para. The para isomer would be a significant fraction. The ratio between ortho and para may vary, but both are possible.\n\n2. Ethyl benzoate (COOC2H5): ester group. Ester is a deactivating group (electron-withdrawing via resonance), and meta directing. So bromine goes to meta. Therefore, the para isomer would have almost zero yield here. \n\n3. Chlorobenzene (Cl): deactivating, but ortho/para directing. So bromine goes to ortho and para. The para isomer's fraction would depend on how much the Cl directs. Since Cl is deactivating, the reaction is slower, but the directing is ortho/para. So the para isomer would have some yield. \n\n4. Nitrobenzene (NO2): nitro is a strong deactivating group, and meta directing. So bromine goes meta. Thus, the para isomer's fraction is negligible (almost zero).\n\n5. Ethylbenzene (C2H5): similar to toluene. The ethyl group is activating (electron-donating), ortho/para directing. The bromine would go to ortho or para. The para isomer's yield would be high, similar to toluene. But maybe ethyl is more activating than methyl? Not sure, but the directing effect is same. So perhaps the ratio between ortho and para is similar to toluene, so the para fraction is same?\n\n6. Benzoic acid (COOH): carboxylic acid is a strong deactivating group, and meta directing. So bromine goes to the meta position. So the para isomer's fraction is almost zero.\n\nNow, the order is from least to most para isomer. The ones with meta directing groups (2, 4,6) have very low para fractions. The others (1,3,5) have higher. \n\nSo between the meta directing groups (2,4,6):\n\nNitro (4) is a stronger meta director than ester (2) or carboxylic acid (6)?",

For toluene, maybe the para isomer is more favored. Let's say that the methyl group directs to o/p, but the major product is para. So the para isomer's weight fraction would be high here.\n\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl ester): the ester group is a deactivating group (since it's an electron-withdrawing group) and meta directing. So the bromine will go to the meta position, so the para isomer's yield is zero. Because the substituent is meta directing, so bromine can't go to para. So this substance would have the least para isomer, so it should be first in the increasing order.\n\n3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene): the -Cl is a deactivating group but ortho/para directing. Even though it's deactivating, it still directs to ortho and para positions. So the bromine will go to ortho or para. The Cl is a weak activating group compared to something like methyl, but it's still directing to o/p. The para isomer's fraction here would depend on how much the Cl directs to para. Since Cl is a deactivating group, maybe the directing effect is weaker than methyl, so the ortho and para might be more equally split? Or maybe the para is still the major.",

So the para isomer would be a major product here, so the weight fraction would be high.\n\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5: Benzene with an ester group (ethyl ester). Ester groups are meta-directing. Because esters are deactivating and meta-directing. So the bromine would go to the meta position. The para isomer would be a minor product, so its weight fraction is low.\n\n3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorobenzene. Chlorine is a deactivating group.",

For example, nitro groups are meta directing, so the major product would be the meta isomer, so the para isomer's yield is minimal. \n\nBut maybe the problem is simpler. Let me think again of each substituent's directing effect and whether they favor ortho/para or meta, and thus the para isomer's yield.\n\nLet me list each substance with their directing effect and the expected major product's position:\n\n1. Toluene (methyl): activating, ortho/para directing. So the bromine can go ortho or para. The para isomer would be a significant fraction. The ratio between ortho and para may vary, but both are possible.\n\n2. Ethyl benzoate (COOC2H5): ester group. Ester is a deactivating group (electron-withdrawing via resonance), and meta directing. So bromine goes to meta. Therefore, the para isomer would have almost zero yield here. \n\n3. Chlorobenzene (Cl): deactivating, but ortho/para directing. So bromine goes to ortho and para. The para isomer's fraction would depend on how much the Cl directs. Since Cl is deactivating, the reaction is slower, but the directing is ortho/para. So the para isomer would have some yield. \n\n4. Nitrobenzene (NO2): nitro is a strong deactivating group, and meta directing. So bromine goes meta. Thus, the para isomer's fraction is negligible (almost zero).\n\n5. Ethylbenzene (C2H5): similar to toluene. The ethyl group is activating (electron-donating), ortho/para directing. The bromine would go to ortho or para. The para isomer's yield would be high, similar to toluene. But maybe ethyl is more activating than methyl? Not sure, but the directing effect is same. So perhaps the ratio between ortho and para is similar to toluene, so the para fraction is same?\n\n6. Benzoic acid (COOH): carboxylic acid is a strong deactivating group, and meta directing. So bromine goes to the meta position. So the para isomer's fraction is almost zero.\n\nNow, the order is from least to most para isomer. The ones with meta directing groups (2, 4,6) have very low para fractions. The others (1,3,5) have higher. \n\nSo between the meta directing groups (2,4,6):\n\nNitro (4) is a stronger meta director than ester (2) or carboxylic acid (6)?",

So the para isomer's weight fraction would be high here.\n\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl ester): the ester group is a deactivating group (since it's an electron-withdrawing group) and meta directing. So the bromine will go to the meta position, so the para isomer's yield is zero. Because the substituent is meta directing, so bromine can't go to para. So this substance would have the least para isomer, so it should be first in the increasing order.\n\n3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene): the -Cl is a deactivating group but ortho/para directing. Even though it's deactivating, it still directs to ortho and para positions. So the bromine will go to ortho or para. The Cl is a weak activating group compared to something like methyl, but it's still directing to o/p. The para isomer's fraction here would depend on how much the Cl directs to para. Since Cl is a deactivating group, maybe the directing effect is weaker than methyl, so the ortho and para might be more equally split? Or maybe the para is still the major.",

Because the more the substituent directs to para, the higher the weight fraction of the para isomer.\n\nFirst, let's list the substituents and their directing effects:\n\n1) C6H5-CH3: Methyl group. Methyl is an activating group (since -CH3 is an electron-donating group), and it's ortho/para directing. So bromine will add mainly in ortho and para positions. Since the question says only one monobromo derivative is formed, that can't be.",

For example, nitro groups are meta directing, so the major product would be the meta isomer, so the para isomer's yield is minimal. \n\nBut maybe the problem is simpler. Let me think again of each substituent's directing effect and whether they favor ortho/para or meta, and thus the para isomer's yield.\n\nLet me list each substance with their directing effect and the expected major product's position:\n\n1. Toluene (methyl): activating, ortho/para directing. So the bromine can go ortho or para. The para isomer would be a significant fraction. The ratio between ortho and para may vary, but both are possible.\n\n2. Ethyl benzoate (COOC2H5): ester group. Ester is a deactivating group (electron-withdrawing via resonance), and meta directing. So bromine goes to meta. Therefore, the para isomer would have almost zero yield here. \n\n3. Chlorobenzene (Cl): deactivating, but ortho/para directing. So bromine goes to ortho and para. The para isomer's fraction would depend on how much the Cl directs. Since Cl is deactivating, the reaction is slower, but the directing is ortho/para. So the para isomer would have some yield. \n\n4. Nitrobenzene (NO2): nitro is a strong deactivating group, and meta directing. So bromine goes meta. Thus, the para isomer's fraction is negligible (almost zero).\n\n5. Ethylbenzene (C2H5): similar to toluene. The ethyl group is activating (electron-donating), ortho/para directing. The bromine would go to ortho or para. The para isomer's yield would be high, similar to toluene. But maybe ethyl is more activating than methyl? Not sure, but the directing effect is same. So perhaps the ratio between ortho and para is similar to toluene, so the para fraction is same?\n\n6. Benzoic acid (COOH): carboxylic acid is a strong deactivating group, and meta directing. So bromine goes to the meta position. So the para isomer's fraction is almost zero.\n\nNow, the order is from least to most para isomer. The ones with meta directing groups (2, 4,6) have very low para fractions. The others (1,3,5) have higher. \n\nSo between the meta directing groups (2,4,6):\n\nNitro (4) is a stronger meta director than ester (2) or carboxylic acid (6)?",

So the bromine will go to the meta position, so the para isomer's yield is zero. Because the substituent is meta directing, so bromine can't go to para. So this substance would have the least para isomer, so it should be first in the increasing order.\n\n3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene): the -Cl is a deactivating group but ortho/para directing. Even though it's deactivating, it still directs to ortho and para positions. So the bromine will go to ortho or para. The Cl is a weak activating group compared to something like methyl, but it's still directing to o/p. The para isomer's fraction here would depend on how much the Cl directs to para.

The stability of the carbocation intermediate (the sigma complex) is crucial. \n\nFor example, in toluene (methyl group), the para position is more substituted (since the methyl is in, say, position 1, then the bromine in position 4 gives a more substituted ring, which is more stable). The ortho positions (positions 2 or 6) would have the methyl adjacent, but the sigma complex for the ortho would have the methyl and bromine adjacent, which might be less stable because of steric hindrance, or maybe not.",
          "text2": "Wait, maybe I should think of the mechanism. The directing groups' effect on the stability of the carbocation intermediate. Let's see:\n\nIn electrophilic substitution, the substituent's effect on directing is based on the stability of the intermediate cation.

But between ortho and para, which is more stabilized? The para position is adjacent to the methyl group, so the methyl's electron-donating effect would stabilize that cation more than the ortho?",

The ortho and para positions are both activated. The ortho and para positions relative to the methyl group are the favored positions. The actual product distribution is roughly 40% o- and 60% p- bromotoluene, I think. So the para isomer is more than half.

Then comes activating groups (1 and5), which have low para fractions.
