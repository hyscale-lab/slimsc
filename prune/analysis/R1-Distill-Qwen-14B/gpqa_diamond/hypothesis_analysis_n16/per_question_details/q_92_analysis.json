To atomize them into gaseous C atoms, the energy is 7 \u00d7 1000 kJ/mol = 7000 kJ/mol.\n\n- The hydrogen atoms needed: each H comes from H2. Since the molecule has 19 H atoms, we need 19/2 moles of H2 (since each H2 has 2 H). The number of moles of H2 is (19/2) mol. The bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol per bond. So the energy to break H-H bonds is (19/2) \u00d7 100 = 9.5 \u00d7100 = 950 kJ/mol.\n\nTotal energy to break bonds in reactants: 7000 + 950 = 7950 kJ/mol.\n\nThen, the energy released when forming the bonds in the product (the molecule):\n\nThe bonds formed are:\n\n- The C-C bonds: including single and double.\n\nDouble bonds: two C=C bonds (each 300 kJ/mol, but since bond energy is the energy required to break, the energy released when forming is also 300 per bond).",

For every mole of H2, you get 2 H atoms, so per H atom, you need 0.5 H2 bonds broken. So total H2 bonds to break for 22 H atoms is 11 moles (since 22 H atoms /2 =11 H2 moles).\n\nThus, energy to break H2 bonds: 11 \u00d7100 kJ =1100 kJ/mol.\n\nTotal energy for reactants (bonds broken):7\u00d71000 +11\u00d7100 =7000 +1100=8100.\n\nEnergy from forming bonds in the product (the molecule): sum of all bond energies in the molecule (C-C, C=C, C-H).\n\nWhich we calculated as 11200.\n\nSo \u0394Hf = 8100 - 11200 = -3100 kJ/mol.\n\nBut the options don't have this.

For hydrocarbons, the standard formation reaction is from carbon (graphite) and H2 gas. So, the bonds broken are those in the elements: each mole of C (graphite) requires 1000 kJ/mol to atomize, and each mole of H2 requires breaking H-H bonds (each H2 has one bond, so per mole, that's 100 kJ). \n\nThe bonds formed are all the bonds in the product molecule. So, the total enthalpy of formation would be the sum of the atomization energies of all the elements minus the sum of the bond energies in the molecule.",

Or maybe since the problem gives the atomization energy of carbon, that might be the energy required to break a mole of carbon into gaseous atoms?), and H2 gas. Let me check the given data again.\n\nThe problem states the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Atomization energy is the energy required to convert one mole of a substance into gaseous atoms. So for carbon, that would be the energy needed to break solid carbon into gaseous C atoms. Similarly, H2 has to be broken into H atoms, so each mole of H2 requires 100 kJ (since bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol). \n\nThe bonds formed in the molecule will be all the C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds in the molecule. \n\nSo the process would be:\n\nStart with elements: C (solid) and H2 (gas).\n\nFirst, atomize the carbon: that's 1000 kJ per mole of C atoms. \n\nThen, break H-H bonds: each mole of H2 provides 2 H atoms, so for each H atom, you need 100/2 = 50 kJ?",

Let me clarify.\n\nThe term CH(CH3) is a carbon that's bonded to a methyl group (CH3) and has another hydrogen. The formula for that carbon would be C attached to CH3, another group (maybe another H?), but in this case, it's connected via single bonds to the previous and next carbons. Let me see:\n\nCarbon4 is connected to carbon3, carbon5, a methyl group, and a hydrogen. So total bonds: 4. So yes, that's correct. So carbon4 has one H attached.\n\nCarbon5 is CH2-, so it has two H's attached besides the bonds to carbon4 and carbon6 (next segment?",

To atomize them into gaseous C atoms, the energy is 7 \u00d7 1000 kJ/mol = 7000 kJ/mol.\n\n- The hydrogen atoms needed: each H comes from H2. Since the molecule has 19 H atoms, we need 19/2 moles of H2 (since each H2 has 2 H). The number of moles of H2 is (19/2) mol. The bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol per bond. So the energy to break H-H bonds is (19/2) \u00d7 100 = 9.5 \u00d7100 = 950 kJ/mol.\n\nTotal energy to break bonds in reactants: 7000 + 950 = 7950 kJ/mol.\n\nThen, the energy released when forming the bonds in the product (the molecule):\n\nThe bonds formed are:\n\n- The C-C bonds: including single and double.\n\nDouble bonds: two C=C bonds (each 300 kJ/mol, but since bond energy is the energy required to break, the energy released when forming is also 300 per bond).",

For every mole of H2, you get 2 H atoms, so per H atom, you need 0.5 H2 bonds broken. So total H2 bonds to break for 22 H atoms is 11 moles (since 22 H atoms /2 =11 H2 moles).\n\nThus, energy to break H2 bonds: 11 \u00d7100 kJ =1100 kJ/mol.\n\nTotal energy for reactants (bonds broken):7\u00d71000 +11\u00d7100 =7000 +1100=8100.\n\nEnergy from forming bonds in the product (the molecule): sum of all bond energies in the molecule (C-C, C=C, C-H).\n\nWhich we calculated as 11200.\n\nSo \u0394Hf = 8100 - 11200 = -3100 kJ/mol.\n\nBut the options don't have this.

Let me confirm each part:\n\nThe first segment (CH3)2C=CH- has C1 (with two CH3), and C2 (connected via double bond to C1, and with a single bond to C3). \n\nThen C3 connects to C2 and is part of CH2 (so two H's?), then C4 (CH(CH3)), C5 (CH2), C6 (CH part of the double bond), and C7 (the central C in the last double bond with two CH3 groups).\n\nSo total 7 carbons. \n\nNow, let's count the number of hydrogens. Let's go through each carbon:\n\nC1: (CH3)2C. So attached to two CH3 groups (each CH3 has 3 H). So C1 has two CH3 groups, so that's 2 * 3 H = 6 H from those. But C1 is also part of the double bond with C2. Since it's a double bond (C=C?), so how many bonds does C1 have? The C1 has two single bonds to the CH3 groups (each CH3 is a single bond to C1), then the double bond to C2. So total bonds from C1: 2 (CH3) + 2 (double bond) = 4. That's correct. So no extra H on C1 itself beyond the CH3 groups. \n\nC2: part of the =CH- group. The C2 is double-bonded to C1, and has a single bond to C3 (the next CH2 group). The remaining bonds on C2: since it's a double bond (counts as 2), plus single bond to C3 (1), so there's one more bond. That's a single H attached to C2. So C2 has one H.\n\nC3: part of the CH2 group. So connected to C2 and C4, and has two H's (since CH2 has two H's). \n\nC4: the CH(CH3) part. Connected to C3 and C5, and has a CH3 group (so one single bond to that CH3), and one more H.",

So:\n\nThe energy required to break the bonds in the reactants is:\n\n- Energy to atomize carbon: each mole of C (as graphite) to gaseous C atoms requires 1000 kJ/mol. Since there are 12 carbons in the molecule, this term is 12 \u00d7 1000 kJ.\n\n- Energy to break H2 bonds: since each H atom comes from H2, the number of H atoms is 23. Each H2 molecule has 2 H atoms, so the number of H2 molecules needed is 23/2. Each H2 bond requires 100 kJ/mol to break. So energy is (23/2)*100 kJ.\n\nThe energy released from forming the bonds in the compound:\n\nThe compound has various bonds:\n\n- C-C single bonds,\n\n- C=C double bonds,\n\n- C-H bonds.\n\nWe need to count each type.\n\nFirst, count the number of each bond type in the compound.\n\nLet's count bonds step by step.\n\nFirst, determine the structure again to count the bonds properly.\n\nThe structure is:\n\n(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\nWe need to count all the bonds:\n\nSingle bonds (C-C) and double bonds (C=C), and C-H bonds.\n\nLet me approach this by counting each bond type.\n\nFirst, C-H bonds. Each H in the molecule is bonded to a C, so the total number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of H atoms, which is 23.\n\nSo C-H bonds:23.\n\nNext, count the C=C double bonds. From the structure, there are two double bonds: one in the first segment (between the (CH3)2C and CH part), and one in the last segment (between the CH and the C(CH3)2 part).\n\nSo two C=C double bonds.\n\nNow, the remaining C-C bonds are single bonds.\n\nTotal C-C bonds: Let's calculate total valence bonds and subtract the double bonds.\n\nEach C atom has four bonds. Total bonds in the molecule (each bond connects two atoms):\n\nTotal bonds = (sum of all bonds)/2.\n\nThe total number of bonds is sum over all atoms of their valence bonds divided by 2.\n\nEach C has 4 bonds, each H has 1 bond.\n\nTotal bonds:\n\nTotal C atoms:12 \u2192 12\u00d74 =48,\n\nTotal H atoms:23 \u00d71 =23,\n\nTotal bonds (counted from each atom's perspective): (48 +23)/2 = 71/2= 35.5 \u2192 which is impossible, so I must have made a mistake here.",

Since each mole of C (graphite) becomes 1 mole of C atoms, so per mole of the compound, which has 12 C atoms, we need 12 * 1000 kJ. \n\nFor hydrogen: each mole of H2 gas must be broken into H atoms. Each H2 molecule has a bond energy of 100 kJ/mol. Since each H2 molecule produces 2 H atoms, the energy needed per mole of H atoms is (100 kJ/mol H2) / 2. \n\nThe total H atoms needed are 22.
