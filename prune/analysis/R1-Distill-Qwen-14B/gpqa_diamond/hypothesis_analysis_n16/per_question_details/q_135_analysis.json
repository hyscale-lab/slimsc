Because spin considerations would require that the interaction term's spin is zero. So X is a scalar, like maybe a Higgs-like particle.\n\nNow, the Lagrangian term looks a bit like Yukawa coupling. The general form for Yukawa interactions is L = -g \u03c8 \u03c8 X, but in this case, it's written as (\u1fe1 + X) \u03c8. Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of the interaction term being X \u03c8 \u03c8. So the vertex is X \u03c8 \u03c8. So each decay would be X \u2192 \u03c8 \u03c8\u0304, right?\n\nSo the decay X \u2192 f f\u0304 would require that the fermion f has a mass m_f \u2264 M_X / 2. That's because each fermion would take at least m_f, so 2m_f \u2264 M_X.\n\nSo X has a mass of 6 GeV. Let's list all the possible fermions and their masses:\n\n- Up quark (u): about 2.2 MeV\n- Down quark (d): about 4.7 MeV\n- Strange quark (s): ~95 MeV\n- Charm quark (c): ~1.3 GeV\n- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV\n- Top quark (t): way too heavy, about 173 GeV, so M_X is 6 GeV, which is less than 2 * 173 GeV, so can't decay into top quarks.\n\nOther fermions:\n- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV\n- Muon (\u03bc): ~105.7 MeV\n- Tau (\u03c4): ~1.78 GeV\n- Neutrinos: super light, but I think they're negligible here.",

The options include various quarks and leptons. So I need to figure out which fermions are light enough that 6 GeV is more than twice their mass.\n\nLet me list the fermion masses. I remember the approximate masses:\n\n- Up and down quarks: about 2-5 MeV each. So 2*m_u \u2248 4 MeV, way less than 6 GeV.\n- Strange quark: about 95-100 MeV. 2*m_s \u2248 200 MeV, which is 0.2 GeV, much less than 6 GeV.\n- Charm quark: ~1.5 GeV. 2*m_c \u2248 3 GeV.

Because spin considerations would require that the interaction term's spin is zero. So X is a scalar, like maybe a Higgs-like particle.\n\nNow, the Lagrangian term looks a bit like Yukawa coupling. The general form for Yukawa interactions is L = -g \u03c8 \u03c8 X, but in this case, it's written as (\u1fe1 + X) \u03c8. Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of the interaction term being X \u03c8 \u03c8. So the vertex is X \u03c8 \u03c8. So each decay would be X \u2192 \u03c8 \u03c8\u0304, right?\n\nSo the decay X \u2192 f f\u0304 would require that the fermion f has a mass m_f \u2264 M_X / 2. That's because each fermion would take at least m_f, so 2m_f \u2264 M_X.\n\nSo X has a mass of 6 GeV.
