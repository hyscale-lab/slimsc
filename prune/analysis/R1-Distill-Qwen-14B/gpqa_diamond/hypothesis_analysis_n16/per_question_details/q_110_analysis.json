That's okay for both instruments.\n\nStar1 is already okay.\n\nSo perhaps for the stars with absolute magnitudes, you have to compute the apparent magnitude, then add extinction if any. For stars with apparent magnitudes given (Star2 and 3), the given value is already the observed apparent magnitude (including extinction). \n\nTherefore, Star3's apparent V is 15.5 (given), so okay for both instruments. \n\nStar4's apparent magnitude after extinction is 16.74, which is over 16 for HIRES (since HIRES needs V <16). 16.74 is dimmer than 16, so HIRES can't observe it. ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so 16.74 is okay. Thus, Star4 cannot be observed by both. \n\nStar5's apparent is ~15.0, which is okay for both.\n\nNow let's list each star's apparent magnitude after considering extinction where needed:\n\nStar1: 15.5 \u2192 OK for both.\n\nStar2: 16.5 \u2192 HIRES needs <16, so no.\n\nStar3: 15.5 \u2192 OK.\n\nStar4: 16.74 \u2192 HIRES can't, ESPRESSO can.\n\nStar5: 15 \u2192 OK.\n\nNow the question is which stars can be detected by both instruments.

That's okay for both instruments.\n\nStar1 is already okay.\n\nSo perhaps for the stars with absolute magnitudes, you have to compute the apparent magnitude, then add extinction if any. For stars with apparent magnitudes given (Star2 and 3), the given value is already the observed apparent magnitude (including extinction). \n\nTherefore, Star3's apparent V is 15.5 (given), so okay for both instruments. \n\nStar4's apparent magnitude after extinction is 16.74, which is over 16 for HIRES (since HIRES needs V <16). 16.74 is dimmer than 16, so HIRES can't observe it. ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so 16.74 is okay. Thus, Star4 cannot be observed by both. \n\nStar5's apparent is ~15.0, which is okay for both.\n\nNow let's list each star's apparent magnitude after considering extinction where needed:\n\nStar1: 15.5 \u2192 OK for both.\n\nStar2: 16.5 \u2192 HIRES needs <16, so no.\n\nStar3: 15.5 \u2192 OK.\n\nStar4: 16.74 \u2192 HIRES can't, ESPRESSO can.\n\nStar5: 15 \u2192 OK.\n\nNow the question is which stars can be detected by both instruments.

So compute apparent.\n\nSo for Star4, let's process it. The absolute magnitude is 15.5. To find apparent magnitude, first compute distance modulus. Distance is 10 pc. So m - M = 5 log10(10/10) = 0, so m = M =15.5. Then, we have to consider extinction. The extinction A_V is 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1*0.4 = 1.24. So the apparent magnitude observed would be m + A_V?",

Unless the problem expects us to subtract the extinction to get the \"true\" apparent magnitude, but that would make it brighter. But why would they do that? The extinction is along the line of sight, so the apparent magnitude observed would already include the extinction. Therefore, the given 15.5 is the correct value. So Star3's apparent V is 15.5, so that's okay. \n\nStar4: absolute V magnitude of 15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, distance 10 pc. Hmm. Here, we need to calculate the apparent V magnitude. Because it's given as absolute, so first calculate the apparent magnitude without extinction, then add the extinction. \n\nThe absolute magnitude M is 15.5.
