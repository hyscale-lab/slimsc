The observed wavelength for the absorption line is from the cloud's rest frame, so it's 1216*(1+z_cloud). So to be in the optical, this must be between, say, 4000 \u00c5 (400 nm) and maybe 6000 \u00c5? So the minimal z_cloud would be when lambda_cloud is at 4000 \u00c5. Then:\n\n4000 = 1216*(1 + z)\n\nSo 1 + z = 4000 / 1216 \u2248 3.29, so z \u2248 2.29. So that would be approximately 2.3, which is closest to option C (2.4).",
          "text2": "Wait, actually, the quasar emits across a broad spectrum, but the hydrogen cloud absorbs the Lyman-alpha photons. The absorption occurs at the rest wavelength of the hydrogen (1216 A), but since the cloud is moving away, the observed absorption is redshifted to a longer wavelength. So the observed absorption wavelength is 1216*(1+z_cloud), where z_cloud is the redshift of the cloud.\n\nTo detect this absorption, the observed wavelength must be within the optical range that the telescope can detect. The quasar itself might be at a higher redshift than the cloud, but the question is about the cloud's redshift. So the key is that the absorption line must be in the optical.\n\nTherefore, the minimal z_cloud is when the observed wavelength is just above the atmospheric cutoff. Let me confirm the atmospheric cutoff again. The Earth's atmosphere is opaque below about 300 nm (3000 A) except for a small window in the ultraviolet. But ground-based optical telescopes can only observe from about 300 nm up. However, the definition of the optical might vary. The visible spectrum is 400-700 nm, so if the observed wavelength must be in the visible, then the cutoff is 400 nm. Otherwise, if it's considered optical as long as it's above 300 nm, then the cutoff would be lower.\n\nThe question is from an exam, perhaps the standard is to take the visible cutoff at 4000 A (400 nm). Let me proceed with that.\n\nSo solving:\n\nlambda_obs = 1216*(1+z) = 4000\n\nSo (1+z) = 4000 /1216 \u2248 3.29\n\nz \u2248 2.29, which is closest to 2.4 (option C). Therefore the answer is C.",

The question is simply asking for the minimal redshift of the cloud (not the quasar) so that the Lyman alpha absorption (at 1216 A emitted) is shifted to the optical window (above 3000 A).

The absorption occurs at the rest frame wavelength of the cloud's hydrogen, so the observed wavelength of the absorption is (1 + z_cloud)*1216 A.
