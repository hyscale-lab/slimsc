Let's compute the norm squared: (-1/2)^2 + (1/\u221a2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 +1/4)=1/2 plus 1/2 gives 1. Okay, so it's normalized. Good.\n\nNow, to compute <Pz>, which is the expectation value of the Pz operator in this state. The matrix for Pz is given. Let me write down the matrix form of Pz again as described in the problem. The first row is (\u0127, 0, 0), second row (0,0,0), third row (0,0,-\u0127). So the Pz matrix is diagonal with entries \u0127, 0, -\u0127 on the diagonal.\n\nSo the operator Pz in matrix form is:\n\n[ \u0127   0    0  ]\n[ 0   0    0  ]\n[ 0   0  -\u0127 ]\n\nSince the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, that makes sense.

Let me compute that first.\n\nFirst, let's compute Pz |\u03c8>:\n\nPz is diagonal, so multiplying the matrix by the vector just scales each component by the diagonal elements. So:\n\nFirst component: \u0127 * (-1/2)\n\nSecond component: 0 * (1/\u221a2) = 0\n\nThird component: -\u0127 * (-1/2) = \u0127*(1/2)\n\nTherefore, Pz|\u03c8> is:\n\n[ -\u0127/2 ]\n[  0   ]\n[  \u0127/2 ]\n\nThen, the expectation value <Pz> is the inner product of |\u03c8> and Pz|\u03c8>.\n\nSo:\n\n(-1/2)(-\u0127/2) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + (-1/2)(\u0127/2) \n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (-1/2)(-\u0127/2) = (1/2)(\u0127/2) = \u0127/4\n\nSecond term: 0\n\nThird term: (-1/2)(\u0127/2) = -\u0127/4\n\nAdding these together: \u0127/4 - \u0127/4 = 0?",

The first row is (\u0127, 0, 0), so the first basis vector (which would be [1,0,0]^T) has eigenvalue \u0127. The second row is all zeros, so the second basis vector (0,1,0)^T has eigenvalue 0. The third row is (0,0,-\u0127), so the third basis vector (0,0,1)^T has eigenvalue -\u0127. \n\nTherefore, the state vector |\u03c8\u27e9 is expressed in terms of the P_z eigenbasis.

Good.\n\nNow, to compute <Pz>, which is the expectation value of the Pz operator in this state. The matrix for Pz is given. Let me write down the matrix form of Pz again as described in the problem. The first row is (\u0127, 0, 0), second row (0,0,0), third row (0,0,-\u0127). So the Pz matrix is diagonal with entries \u0127, 0, -\u0127 on the diagonal.\n\nSo the operator Pz in matrix form is:\n\n[ \u0127   0    0  ]\n[ 0   0    0  ]\n[ 0   0  -\u0127 ]\n\nSince the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, that makes sense. So when we compute expectation values, we can proceed by multiplying the state vector with the matrix and then taking the inner product.\n\nThe state vector is a column vector: \n\n|\u03c8> = [ -1/2 ]\n       [ 1/\u221a2 ]\n       [ -1/2 ]\n\nSo <\u03c8|Pz|\u03c8> is the expectation value. Let me compute that first.\n\nFirst, let's compute Pz |\u03c8>:\n\nPz is diagonal, so multiplying the matrix by the vector just scales each component by the diagonal elements. So:\n\nFirst component: \u0127 * (-1/2)\n\nSecond component: 0 * (1/\u221a2) = 0\n\nThird component: -\u0127 * (-1/2) = \u0127*(1/2)\n\nTherefore, Pz|\u03c8> is:\n\n[ -\u0127/2 ]\n[  0   ]\n[  \u0127/2 ]\n\nThen, the expectation value <Pz> is the inner product of |\u03c8> and Pz|\u03c8>.\n\nSo:\n\n(-1/2)(-\u0127/2) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + (-1/2)(\u0127/2) \n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (-1/2)(-\u0127/2) = (1/2)(\u0127/2) = \u0127/4\n\nSecond term: 0\n\nThird term: (-1/2)(\u0127/2) = -\u0127/4\n\nAdding these together: \u0127/4 - \u0127/4 = 0?",

Okay, so it is normalized. That's good.\n\nNow, since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, each basis vector corresponds to an eigenvalue of P_z. Let me see the matrix for P_z. The first row is (\u0127, 0, 0), so the first basis vector (which would be [1,0,0]^T) has eigenvalue \u0127. The second row is all zeros, so the second basis vector (0,1,0)^T has eigenvalue 0. The third row is (0,0,-\u0127), so the third basis vector (0,0,1)^T has eigenvalue -\u0127. \n\nTherefore, the state vector |\u03c8\u27e9 is expressed in terms of the P_z eigenbasis.

The given matrix for P_z has first row (\u0127, 0, 0), second row (0,0,0), third row (0,0,-\u0127). So the eigenvalues of P_z are \u0127, 0, -\u0127 for the first, second, and third basis vectors respectively. \n\nThe state vector is a column vector with components ( -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ).
