So in the case of classical ED, since it's not a quantum theory, you don't compute Feynman diagrams, so you don't get the UV divergences that require regularization. So in that case, D is correct. Because the other options are QFTs (except string theory) which do need it, but string theory is a QFT?",

          "text2": "Wait, but the question is phrased as \"never requires regularization at high energies\". The key here is that the question might be looking for the theory that, when you do the quantum calculations, doesn't need regularization. Because Classical Electrodynamics isn't a quantum theory, so the question might be excluding it. The options A, B, C are all quantum theories. The question is which quantum theory never needs regularization. So then between A, B, and C.\n\nSo Superstring Theory (A) is supposed to be finite, so it doesn't require regularization. So A would be the correct answer. But why is D an option? Because maybe someone might think that classical theories don't need it. But the question is asking which theory never requires it. Since D is a classical theory, it doesn't use regularization at all. But maybe the question is looking for a quantum theory that doesn't require it. The wording says \"never requires regularization at high energies\". Since classical theories don't have the same divergences, perhaps the answer is D.",
