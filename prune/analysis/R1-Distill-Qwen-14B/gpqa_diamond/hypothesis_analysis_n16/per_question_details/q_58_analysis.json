Superstring theory is a type of string theory, which incorporates supersymmetry. String theories are different from quantum field theories in that they don't have point particles but rather strings. In string theory, the concept of a point particle is replaced by a string, and calculations involve higher-dimensional objects and integrals over the string's worldsheet. I think that in string theory, the divergences that occur in QFT might not show up in the same way or are naturally tamed.",
