That's two configurations. \n\nThe rest (6 configurations) have sum =-1, leading to energy +J. \n\nTherefore, the partition function Z is:\n\nZ = (number of states with E1) * e^{-\u03b2E1} + (number of states with E2)*e^{-\u03b2E2}\n\nSo, for the two states with E = -3J, their contribution is 2 * e^{-\u03b2*(-3J)} = 2 e^{3\u03b2J}\n\nFor the other 6 states with E = +J, their contribution is 6 * e^{-\u03b2*(J)} =6 e^{-\u03b2J}\n\nTherefore, Z=2e^{3\u03b2J} +6e^{-\u03b2J}\n\nLooking at the options, that's option B: Z= 2 e^(3J\u03b2)+6e^(-J\u03b2)",

So all configurations with two of one kind and one of the other have the same E. \n\nCase 4: All three spins are -1. Then each product is 1 again, so the sum is 3. So energy is -J*3. \n\nSo the total energy for all three +1 is -3J, same as all three -1. The other cases (two of one and one of the other) have E = +J. \n\nSo how many configurations are there for each energy?\n\n- The all + and all - cases: each has 1 configuration. So total of 2 configurations with energy -3J.\n\n- The other cases (two + one -, or two - one +) have 6 configurations (since for each of the two possibilities (two +, one - or two -, one +), there are 3 each, so 3+3=6). Each of these has energy +J. \n\nSo the energy levels are:\n\nE1 = -3J with multiplicity 2,\n\nE2 = +J with multiplicity 6.\n\nTherefore, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of e^{-\u03b2E}.\n\nSo for each energy level, the contribution is (number of states) \u00d7 e^{-\u03b2E}.\n\nThus,\n\nZ = (2) e^{-\u03b2*(-3J)} + (6) e^{-\u03b2*(J)}",
