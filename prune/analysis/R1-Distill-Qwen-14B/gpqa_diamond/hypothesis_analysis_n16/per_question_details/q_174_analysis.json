          "text1": "Wait, the rest mass energy of the initial nucleus is 300 GeV. So M c\u00b2 = 300 GeV. The total rest mass energy of the two fragments is (m + 2m)c\u00b2 = 3m c\u00b2. But that's 99% of the original, so 3m c\u00b2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV \u2192 3m c\u00b2 = 297 GeV. So each fragment's rest mass energy would be m c\u00b2 (for the smaller) and 2m c\u00b2 (for the larger). But okay, moving on.\n\nThe total energy before fission is just the rest mass energy of the nucleus: 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the two fragments plus their kinetic energies. Let me write that equation:\n\nInitial energy: M c\u00b2 = 300 GeV.\n\nFinal energy: (m c\u00b2 + T1) + (2m c\u00b2 + T2) = (3m c\u00b2) + (T1 + T2) \n\nSo, 300 GeV = 3m c\u00b2 + (T1 + T2). Since 3m c\u00b2 is 297 GeV (from earlier), so 300 = 297 + T1 + T2 \u2192 T1 + T2 = 3 GeV. So the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV.\n\nNow, because the nucleus was initially at rest, the momenta of the fragments must be equal and opposite. Let the velocity of the smaller fragment be v1, and the larger be v2. Then:\n\nm v1 = 2m v2 \u2192 v1 = 2 v2.",
          "text2": "Wait, 3m = 0.99M. So m = (0.99M)/3. Let me compute that numerically. Since M is 300 GeV/c\u00b2, then m = 0.99/3 *300 = 0.33*300 = 99 GeV/c\u00b2. So the masses are m = 99, and 2m = 198. Their sum is 297 GeV/c\u00b2, which is 99% of 300. That checks out.\n\nSo now, the total rest mass energy of the fragments is 297 GeV (since each rest mass is multiplied by c\u00b2, so 99 + 198 = 297 GeV). The original mass had a rest energy of 300 GeV, so the difference is 3 GeV. That energy must have been converted into kinetic energy of the fragments. So the total kinetic energy of both fragments is 3 GeV. \n\nBut the problem says, kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. We need to find the difference between the actual T1 (using relativistic equations) and the classical calculation. \n\nFirst, let's think about conservation of momentum. Since the nucleus was initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. Therefore, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. So, the momentum of the more massive fragment (2m) is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to that of the lighter fragment (m). Let me denote the velocities (or momenta) accordingly.\n\nIn classical mechanics, the kinetic energy would be calculated using \u00bdmv\u00b2. But since momentum must be conserved, their momenta must be equal in magnitude. Let me denote the momentum as p for the lighter fragment, so the heavier fragment has momentum -p. \n\nThe classical kinetic energy for each would be (p\u00b2)/(2m) for the lighter, and (p\u00b2)/(2*(2m)) for the heavier. The total kinetic energy is then (p\u00b2/(2m)) + (p\u00b2/(4m)) = (3/4)(p\u00b2/m). But the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV.",

          "text1": "Wait, but in reality, some energy would go into binding energy or radiation, but maybe in this problem, they want us to assume that all the mass difference is kinetic energy. The problem says \"sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M\". So the mass defect is 0.01*M, so the energy released is (0.01*M)c\u00b2. That energy must be the total kinetic energy of the fragments, since they are the only products (no other particles mentioned). \n\nSo the total kinetic energy is (0.01*M)c\u00b2. Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. Let me denote the masses as m1 and m2. Since m1 = 2*m2, let me let m2 = m, so m1 = 2m. Then m1 + m2 = 3m = 0.99M. Therefore, m = 0.99M/3 \u2248 0.33M. So m1 = 0.66M and m2 = 0.33M.\n\nNow, the total kinetic energy is T1 + T2 = (0.01*M)c\u00b2. The question is to find the difference between T1 (the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, which is m1) calculated relativistically versus classically.\n\nSo, first, let's work out the classical case. In classical mechanics, the system's center of mass is at rest (since initial momentum is zero), so the two fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude but opposite directions. Let their velocities be v1 and v2. Then m1*v1 = -m2*v2. \n\nLet me write momentum conservation: p1 + p2 = 0 \u2192 m1*v1 = -m2*v2. So (2m)v1 = -m v2 \u2192 v2 = -2v1. \n\nThe kinetic energy in classical mechanics is (1/2)m1 v1\u00b2 + (1/2)m2 v2\u00b2. Substitute v2 = -2v1. Then the kinetic energy becomes (1/2)(2m)v1\u00b2 + (1/2)(m)(4v1\u00b2) = (m v1\u00b2) + (2 m v1\u00b2) = 3 m v1\u00b2. \n\nThe total kinetic energy is 3 m v1\u00b2 = (0.01 M)c\u00b2. So solving for v1\u00b2: v1\u00b2 = (0.01 M c\u00b2)/(3 m). But since m is 0.33M, which is (0.99/3) M, so m = (0.99/3) M. \n\nTherefore substituting m:\n\nv1\u00b2 = (0.01 M c\u00b2) / [3*(0.99/3) M)] \u2192 the 3 cancels in denominator, so denominator is 0.99 M \u2192 v1\u00b2 = (0.01 c\u00b2)/(0.99) \u2192 v1 = c * sqrt(0.01/0.99). \n\nBut let's see, actually, perhaps I can proceed numerically.",
          "text2": "Wait, that's 3 GeV total? But that seems like a lot. Let me confirm. \n\nYes, the rest mass energy of the products is less than the original, so the difference is the energy released. Since the nucleus was initially at rest, all that energy goes into kinetic energy of the fragments. So total kinetic energy of both fragments combined is 3 GeV. But the question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and comparing the actual value with the classical approximation. \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) T1. So I need to calculate both and find their difference. \n\nFirst, let's do the classical case. In classical mechanics, momentum conservation requires that the two fragments have equal and opposite momenta. Let me denote the velocities of the two fragments as v1 and v2. The momentum conservation gives m1 v1 = -m2 v2. Since m2 = 2m, then m v1 = -2m v2 \u2192 v1 = -2 v2. So the velocities are in opposite directions, with the more massive fragment moving slower. \n\nThe kinetic energy for each would be (1/2) m v\u00b2. Let me denote the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (mass 2m) as T1_classical and the smaller one as T2_classical. \n\nTotal kinetic energy is T1 + T2 = 3 GeV. \n\nFrom momentum conservation: the magnitudes of the momenta are equal, so m * v1 = 2m * v2 \u2192 v1 = 2 v2.",

Given that one is twice as massive as the other. Let's say the more massive fragment is m1 = 2*m2. So m1 + m2 = 3*m2 = 0.99*M. Therefore, m2 = (0.99*M)/3 = 0.33*M, and m1 = 0.66*M.",

So M = 3m1 / 0.99. \n\nWe need to find T1, which is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m2 = 2m1), and compare it between relativistic and classical calculations.\n\nFirst, let's consider conservation of momentum. Since the nucleus was initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. Therefore, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. So, m2*v2 = -m1*v1. \n\nLet me think of velocities as vectors, but since they are opposite, their magnitudes will satisfy m1*v1 = m2*v2. So, since m2 = 2m1, then v1 = (m2/m1)*v2 = 2v2. \n\nSo the velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. \n\nIn the classical case, kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv\u00b2. Let's compute classical T1 first.\n\nIn classical mechanics: \n\nKinetic energy of the fragments are (1/2)m1 v1\u00b2 and (1/2)m2 v2\u00b2. Since the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, we can write:\n\n(1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + (1/2 m2 v2\u00b2) = 3 GeV. \n\nBut since m2 = 2m1, substitute that in:\n\n(1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + (1/2 *2m1 v2\u00b2) = 3 GeV \u2192 (1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV.\n\nAlso, from momentum conservation, m1 v1 = m2 v2 \u2192 m1 v1 = 2m1 v2 \u2192 v1 = 2v2. \n\nSo substituting v1 = 2v2 into the equation:\n\n(1/2 m1 (2v2)^2) + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV \n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 1/2 m1 *4v2\u00b2 = 2 m1 v2\u00b2 \n\nSecond term: m1 v2\u00b2. \n\nTotal: 2 m1 v2\u00b2 + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV \u2192 m1 v2\u00b2 = 1 GeV. \n\nThen the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m2 = 2m1) is (1/2)(2m1) v2\u00b2 = m1 v2\u00b2 = 1 GeV. \n\nSo in the classical case, T1 (kinetic energy of the more massive fragment) is 1 GeV. \n\nNow, the actual T1 is different. To compute the relativistic case, we need to use relativistic equations. \n\nLet me recall that in relativity, the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Also, momentum is p = \u03b3mv, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. \n\nSince the total momentum is zero, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let me denote the velocity of the more massive fragment (m2) as v, then the other fragment (m1) must have velocity u such that m2 v = m1 u. Since m2 = 2m1, then 2m1 v = m1 u \u2192 u = 2v. \n\nSo, their velocities are in the ratio 1:2 inversely proportional to their masses, same as in classical case. \n\nNow, the total energy of the system must be conserved. The initial total energy is Mc\u00b2 = 300 GeV. \n\nThe final total energy is the sum of the rest mass energies plus the kinetic energies.",

So the masses are m = 99, and 2m = 198. Their sum is 297 GeV/c\u00b2, which is 99% of 300. That checks out.\n\nSo now, the total rest mass energy of the fragments is 297 GeV (since each rest mass is multiplied by c\u00b2, so 99 + 198 = 297 GeV). The original mass had a rest energy of 300 GeV, so the difference is 3 GeV. That energy must have been converted into kinetic energy of the fragments. So the total kinetic energy of both fragments is 3 GeV. \n\nBut the problem says, kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. We need to find the difference between the actual T1 (using relativistic equations) and the classical calculation. \n\nFirst, let's think about conservation of momentum. Since the nucleus was initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. Therefore, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. So, the momentum of the more massive fragment (2m) is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to that of the lighter fragment (m).

The total kinetic energy is then (p\u00b2/(2m)) + (p\u00b2/(4m)) = (3/4)(p\u00b2/m). But the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV.",

The question is, when using classical approximation, are they assuming that the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v\u00b2?

Because even if the velocities are non-relativistic, the energy conservation includes the rest mass energies. But perhaps the difference here is that in the classical calculation, they might have neglected the rest mass change?",

So the speed of the lighter fragment is twice that of the heavier one. \n\nWe need to find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (which is m1), T1. The question asks for the difference between the correct T1 (using relativistic equations) and the classical approximation.\n\nFirst, let's compute the classical case. In classical physics, kinetic energy is (1/2)mv\u00b2. Since the momentum is conserved, the momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite. Let\u2019s denote p as the magnitude of each. So m1 v1 = p \u2192 v1 = p/m1, and m2 v2 = p \u2192 v2 = p/m2. \n\nThe total kinetic energy is (1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + (1/2 m2 v2\u00b2) = (p\u00b2/(2 m1)) + (p\u00b2/(2 m2)). Since m1 = 2 m2, substitute m2 = m1/2. So:\n\nTotal KE classical = p\u00b2/(2 m1) + p\u00b2/(2*(m1/2)) = p\u00b2/(2 m1) + p\u00b2/(m1) = (3/2) p\u00b2/(m1). \n\nBut the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV.

So the speed of the lighter fragment is twice that of the heavier one. \n\nWe need to find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (which is m1), T1. The question asks for the difference between the correct T1 (using relativistic equations) and the classical approximation.\n\nFirst, let's compute the classical case. In classical physics, kinetic energy is (1/2)mv\u00b2. Since the momentum is conserved, the momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite. Let\u2019s denote p as the magnitude of each. So m1 v1 = p \u2192 v1 = p/m1, and m2 v2 = p \u2192 v2 = p/m2. \n\nThe total kinetic energy is (1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + (1/2 m2 v2\u00b2) = (p\u00b2/(2 m1)) + (p\u00b2/(2 m2)). Since m1 = 2 m2, substitute m2 = m1/2. So:\n\nTotal KE classical = p\u00b2/(2 m1) + p\u00b2/(2*(m1/2)) = p\u00b2/(2 m1) + p\u00b2/(m1) = (3/2) p\u00b2/(m1). \n\nBut the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV. So (3/2)(p\u00b2/m1) = 3 GeV \u2192 p\u00b2/m1 = 2 GeV. \n\nBut also, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) in classical is (p\u00b2)/(2 m1). Since T1 = (p\u00b2)/(2 m1), from above, since p\u00b2/m1 is 2 GeV, then T1 is 1 GeV.",

So M = 3m1 / 0.99. \n\nWe need to find T1, which is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m2 = 2m1), and compare it between relativistic and classical calculations.\n\nFirst, let's consider conservation of momentum. Since the nucleus was initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. Therefore, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. So, m2*v2 = -m1*v1. \n\nLet me think of velocities as vectors, but since they are opposite, their magnitudes will satisfy m1*v1 = m2*v2. So, since m2 = 2m1, then v1 = (m2/m1)*v2 = 2v2. \n\nSo the velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. \n\nIn the classical case, kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv\u00b2. Let's compute classical T1 first.\n\nIn classical mechanics: \n\nKinetic energy of the fragments are (1/2)m1 v1\u00b2 and (1/2)m2 v2\u00b2. Since the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, we can write:\n\n(1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + (1/2 m2 v2\u00b2) = 3 GeV. \n\nBut since m2 = 2m1, substitute that in:\n\n(1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + (1/2 *2m1 v2\u00b2) = 3 GeV \u2192 (1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV.\n\nAlso, from momentum conservation, m1 v1 = m2 v2 \u2192 m1 v1 = 2m1 v2 \u2192 v1 = 2v2. \n\nSo substituting v1 = 2v2 into the equation:\n\n(1/2 m1 (2v2)^2) + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV \n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 1/2 m1 *4v2\u00b2 = 2 m1 v2\u00b2 \n\nSecond term: m1 v2\u00b2. \n\nTotal: 2 m1 v2\u00b2 + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV \u2192 m1 v2\u00b2 = 1 GeV. \n\nThen the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m2 = 2m1) is (1/2)(2m1) v2\u00b2 = m1 v2\u00b2 = 1 GeV. \n\nSo in the classical case, T1 (kinetic energy of the more massive fragment) is 1 GeV. \n\nNow, the actual T1 is different. To compute the relativistic case, we need to use relativistic equations. \n\nLet me recall that in relativity, the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Also, momentum is p = \u03b3mv, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. \n\nSince the total momentum is zero, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

The kinetic energy is (Total energy) - (rest mass energy) = (Total energy) - 0.99 M c\u00b2. But also, the total energy must equal the original energy (since energy is conserved). So:\n\nTotal energy after = M c\u00b2 = (E1 + E2)\n\nWhere E1 = gamma1 m1 c\u00b2 (total energy of fragment 1), E2 = gamma2 m2 c\u00b2.\n\nThus, gamma1 m1 c\u00b2 + gamma2 m2 c\u00b2 = M c\u00b2.\n\nAlso, since the system is initially at rest, the total momentum must be zero. Therefore, the momenta of the fragments are equal and opposite. So:\n\ngamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.\n\nBut since they are moving in opposite directions, the magnitudes are equal. So:\n\ngamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2 \u2192 (gamma1 m1 v1)/(gamma2 m2 v2) =1.\n\nHmm, this seems complex. To solve for velocities, perhaps we can set variables and find equations.\n\nLet me denote variables:\n\nLet\u2019s let fragment 1 (more massive) have mass m1 = 2m2 (since it's twice as massive as fragment 2). Let m2 = m, so m1 = 2m. Then m1 + m2 = 3m =0.99 M.\n\nSo m = 0.33 M, m1 =0.66 M, m2 =0.33 M.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the speed of fragment 1 as v1, fragment 2 as v2. Since they are in opposite directions, their velocities are -v1 and v2 (or vice versa), so the momentum equation is:\n\ngamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2. (magnitude-wise, since direction is opposite)\n\nWe also have the energy equation:\n\ngamma1 m1 c\u00b2 + gamma2 m2 c\u00b2 = M c\u00b2.\n\nWe also know that the rest mass energy of the fragments is (m1 + m2)c\u00b2 =0.99 M c\u00b2, so that checks out with the energy equation. The difference M c\u00b2 -0.99 M c\u00b2 =0.01 M c\u00b2 is the total kinetic energy.\n\nWe need to find T1 = (gamma1 -1)m1 c\u00b2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to solving for gamma1 and then computing T1, then subtract the classical value (1 GeV) to find the difference.\n\nThis seems a bit involved. Let me see if there's a way to simplify.\n\nLet me set variables:\n\nLet\u2019s let m2 = m, so m1 = 2m. Then the equations are:\n\nEquation 1: gamma1*(2m)*v1 = gamma2*m*v2 \u2192 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.\n\nEquation 2: gamma1*(2m)c\u00b2 + gamma2*(m)c\u00b2 = M c\u00b2.\n\nAlso, since the rest mass of fragments is 0.99 M, so 2m + m = 3m =0.99 M \u2192 m =0.33 M.\n\nThus, substituting m =0.33 M into equation 2:\n\ngamma1*(2*0.33 M)c\u00b2 + gamma2*(0.33 M)c\u00b2 = M c\u00b2.\n\nDivide both sides by M c\u00b2:\n\ngamma1*(0.66) + gamma2*(0.33) =1.\n\nSo equation 2 becomes 0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 =1.\n\nEquation 1: 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2 \u2192 gamma2 v2 = 2 gamma1 v1.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can express v2 in terms of v1. Let's see.\n\nAssuming that the velocities are along the same line (say, x-axis), with fragment 1 going in +x and fragment 2 in -x, so their velocities are v1 and -v2. The momentum equation would be gamma1 m1 v1 - gamma2 m2 v2 =0 \u2192 gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2. Which is same as equation 1.\n\nSo, let's assume that v2 = k v1. Let me denote k = v2 /v1.\n\nThen equation 1 gives:\n\n2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 (k v1) \u2192 2 gamma1 = gamma2 k \u2192 gamma2 = (2 gamma1)/k.\n\nNow substitute into equation 2:\n\n0.66 gamma1 + 0.33*(2 gamma1 /k) =1 \u2192 0.66 gamma1 + (0.66 gamma1)/k =1 \u2192 gamma1 (0.66 (1 + 1/k) ) =1 \u2192 gamma1 = 1 / [0.66 (1 +1/k) ]\n\nBut we need another relation between v1 and k.

That energy must be the total kinetic energy of the fragments, since they are the only products (no other particles mentioned). \n\nSo the total kinetic energy is (0.01*M)c\u00b2. Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. Let me denote the masses as m1 and m2.

Let their velocities be v1 and v2. Then m1*v1 = -m2*v2. \n\nLet me write momentum conservation: p1 + p2 = 0 \u2192 m1*v1 = -m2*v2. So (2m)v1 = -m v2 \u2192 v2 = -2v1. \n\nThe kinetic energy in classical mechanics is (1/2)m1 v1\u00b2 + (1/2)m2 v2\u00b2. Substitute v2 = -2v1. Then the kinetic energy becomes (1/2)(2m)v1\u00b2 + (1/2)(m)(4v1\u00b2) = (m v1\u00b2) + (2 m v1\u00b2) = 3 m v1\u00b2. \n\nThe total kinetic energy is 3 m v1\u00b2 = (0.01 M)c\u00b2. So solving for v1\u00b2: v1\u00b2 = (0.01 M c\u00b2)/(3 m). But since m is 0.33M, which is (0.99/3) M, so m = (0.99/3) M. \n\nTherefore substituting m:\n\nv1\u00b2 = (0.01 M c\u00b2) / [3*(0.99/3) M)] \u2192 the 3 cancels in denominator, so denominator is 0.99 M \u2192 v1\u00b2 = (0.01 c\u00b2)/(0.99) \u2192 v1 = c * sqrt(0.01/0.99). \n\nBut let's see, actually, perhaps I can proceed numerically.",

So, since m2 = 2m1, then v1 = (m2/m1)*v2 = 2v2. \n\nSo the velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. \n\nIn the classical case, kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv\u00b2. Let's compute classical T1 first.\n\nIn classical mechanics: \n\nKinetic energy of the fragments are (1/2)m1 v1\u00b2 and (1/2)m2 v2\u00b2. Since the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, we can write:\n\n(1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + (1/2 m2 v2\u00b2) = 3 GeV. \n\nBut since m2 = 2m1, substitute that in:\n\n(1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + (1/2 *2m1 v2\u00b2) = 3 GeV \u2192 (1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV.\n\nAlso, from momentum conservation, m1 v1 = m2 v2 \u2192 m1 v1 = 2m1 v2 \u2192 v1 = 2v2. \n\nSo substituting v1 = 2v2 into the equation:\n\n(1/2 m1 (2v2)^2) + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV \n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 1/2 m1 *4v2\u00b2 = 2 m1 v2\u00b2 \n\nSecond term: m1 v2\u00b2. \n\nTotal: 2 m1 v2\u00b2 + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV \u2192 m1 v2\u00b2 = 1 GeV. \n\nThen the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m2 = 2m1) is (1/2)(2m1) v2\u00b2 = m1 v2\u00b2 = 1 GeV. \n\nSo in the classical case, T1 (kinetic energy of the more massive fragment) is 1 GeV. \n\nNow, the actual T1 is different. To compute the relativistic case, we need to use relativistic equations. \n\nLet me recall that in relativity, the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Also, momentum is p = \u03b3mv, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. \n\nSince the total momentum is zero, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let me denote the velocity of the more massive fragment (m2) as v, then the other fragment (m1) must have velocity u such that m2 v = m1 u. Since m2 = 2m1, then 2m1 v = m1 u \u2192 u = 2v. \n\nSo, their velocities are in the ratio 1:2 inversely proportional to their masses, same as in classical case. \n\nNow, the total energy of the system must be conserved. The initial total energy is Mc\u00b2 = 300 GeV. \n\nThe final total energy is the sum of the rest mass energies plus the kinetic energies.",

But that's 99% of the original, so 3m c\u00b2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV \u2192 3m c\u00b2 = 297 GeV. So each fragment's rest mass energy would be m c\u00b2 (for the smaller) and 2m c\u00b2 (for the larger). But okay, moving on.\n\nThe total energy before fission is just the rest mass energy of the nucleus: 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the two fragments plus their kinetic energies. Let me write that equation:\n\nInitial energy: M c\u00b2 = 300 GeV.\n\nFinal energy: (m c\u00b2 + T1) + (2m c\u00b2 + T2) = (3m c\u00b2) + (T1 + T2) \n\nSo, 300 GeV = 3m c\u00b2 + (T1 + T2). Since 3m c\u00b2 is 297 GeV (from earlier), so 300 = 297 + T1 + T2 \u2192 T1 + T2 = 3 GeV. So the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV.\n\nNow, because the nucleus was initially at rest, the momenta of the fragments must be equal and opposite.

So the masses are m = 99, and 2m = 198. Their sum is 297 GeV/c\u00b2, which is 99% of 300. That checks out.\n\nSo now, the total rest mass energy of the fragments is 297 GeV (since each rest mass is multiplied by c\u00b2, so 99 + 198 = 297 GeV). The original mass had a rest energy of 300 GeV, so the difference is 3 GeV. That energy must have been converted into kinetic energy of the fragments. So the total kinetic energy of both fragments is 3 GeV. \n\nBut the problem says, kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. We need to find the difference between the actual T1 (using relativistic equations) and the classical calculation. \n\nFirst, let's think about conservation of momentum. Since the nucleus was initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. Therefore, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. So, the momentum of the more massive fragment (2m) is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to that of the lighter fragment (m).

The problem says \"sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M\". So the mass defect is 0.01*M, so the energy released is (0.01*M)c\u00b2. That energy must be the total kinetic energy of the fragments, since they are the only products (no other particles mentioned). \n\nSo the total kinetic energy is (0.01*M)c\u00b2. Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. Let me denote the masses as m1 and m2. Since m1 = 2*m2, let me let m2 = m, so m1 = 2m. Then m1 + m2 = 3m = 0.99M. Therefore, m = 0.99M/3 \u2248 0.33M. So m1 = 0.66M and m2 = 0.33M.\n\nNow, the total kinetic energy is T1 + T2 = (0.01*M)c\u00b2. The question is to find the difference between T1 (the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, which is m1) calculated relativistically versus classically.\n\nSo, first, let's work out the classical case. In classical mechanics, the system's center of mass is at rest (since initial momentum is zero), so the two fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude but opposite directions. Let their velocities be v1 and v2. Then m1*v1 = -m2*v2. \n\nLet me write momentum conservation: p1 + p2 = 0 \u2192 m1*v1 = -m2*v2. So (2m)v1 = -m v2 \u2192 v2 = -2v1. \n\nThe kinetic energy in classical mechanics is (1/2)m1 v1\u00b2 + (1/2)m2 v2\u00b2. Substitute v2 = -2v1. Then the kinetic energy becomes (1/2)(2m)v1\u00b2 + (1/2)(m)(4v1\u00b2) = (m v1\u00b2) + (2 m v1\u00b2) = 3 m v1\u00b2. \n\nThe total kinetic energy is 3 m v1\u00b2 = (0.01 M)c\u00b2. So solving for v1\u00b2: v1\u00b2 = (0.01 M c\u00b2)/(3 m). But since m is 0.33M, which is (0.99/3) M, so m = (0.99/3) M. \n\nTherefore substituting m:\n\nv1\u00b2 = (0.01 M c\u00b2) / [3*(0.99/3) M)] \u2192 the 3 cancels in denominator, so denominator is 0.99 M \u2192 v1\u00b2 = (0.01 c\u00b2)/(0.99) \u2192 v1 = c * sqrt(0.01/0.99). \n\nBut let's see, actually, perhaps I can proceed numerically.",

But the question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and comparing the actual value with the classical approximation. \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) T1. So I need to calculate both and find their difference. \n\nFirst, let's do the classical case. In classical mechanics, momentum conservation requires that the two fragments have equal and opposite momenta. Let me denote the velocities of the two fragments as v1 and v2. The momentum conservation gives m1 v1 = -m2 v2. Since m2 = 2m, then m v1 = -2m v2 \u2192 v1 = -2 v2.

Since the nucleus was initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. Therefore, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. So, m2*v2 = -m1*v1. \n\nLet me think of velocities as vectors, but since they are opposite, their magnitudes will satisfy m1*v1 = m2*v2. So, since m2 = 2m1, then v1 = (m2/m1)*v2 = 2v2. \n\nSo the velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. \n\nIn the classical case, kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv\u00b2. Let's compute classical T1 first.\n\nIn classical mechanics: \n\nKinetic energy of the fragments are (1/2)m1 v1\u00b2 and (1/2)m2 v2\u00b2. Since the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, we can write:\n\n(1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + (1/2 m2 v2\u00b2) = 3 GeV. \n\nBut since m2 = 2m1, substitute that in:\n\n(1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + (1/2 *2m1 v2\u00b2) = 3 GeV \u2192 (1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV.\n\nAlso, from momentum conservation, m1 v1 = m2 v2 \u2192 m1 v1 = 2m1 v2 \u2192 v1 = 2v2. \n\nSo substituting v1 = 2v2 into the equation:\n\n(1/2 m1 (2v2)^2) + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV \n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 1/2 m1 *4v2\u00b2 = 2 m1 v2\u00b2 \n\nSecond term: m1 v2\u00b2. \n\nTotal: 2 m1 v2\u00b2 + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV \u2192 m1 v2\u00b2 = 1 GeV. \n\nThen the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m2 = 2m1) is (1/2)(2m1) v2\u00b2 = m1 v2\u00b2 = 1 GeV. \n\nSo in the classical case, T1 (kinetic energy of the more massive fragment) is 1 GeV. \n\nNow, the actual T1 is different. To compute the relativistic case, we need to use relativistic equations. \n\nLet me recall that in relativity, the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Also, momentum is p = \u03b3mv, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. \n\nSince the total momentum is zero, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let me denote the velocity of the more massive fragment (m2) as v, then the other fragment (m1) must have velocity u such that m2 v = m1 u. Since m2 = 2m1, then 2m1 v = m1 u \u2192 u = 2v. \n\nSo, their velocities are in the ratio 1:2 inversely proportional to their masses, same as in classical case. \n\nNow, the total energy of the system must be conserved. The initial total energy is Mc\u00b2 = 300 GeV. \n\nThe final total energy is the sum of the rest mass energies plus the kinetic energies.",
          "text2": "Wait, 3m = 0.99M. So m = (0.99M)/3. Let me compute that numerically. Since M is 300 GeV/c\u00b2, then m = 0.99/3 *300 = 0.33*300 = 99 GeV/c\u00b2. So the masses are m = 99, and 2m = 198. Their sum is 297 GeV/c\u00b2, which is 99% of 300. That checks out.\n\nSo now, the total rest mass energy of the fragments is 297 GeV (since each rest mass is multiplied by c\u00b2, so 99 + 198 = 297 GeV). The original mass had a rest energy of 300 GeV, so the difference is 3 GeV. That energy must have been converted into kinetic energy of the fragments. So the total kinetic energy of both fragments is 3 GeV. \n\nBut the problem says, kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. We need to find the difference between the actual T1 (using relativistic equations) and the classical calculation. \n\nFirst, let's think about conservation of momentum. Since the nucleus was initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. Therefore, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. So, the momentum of the more massive fragment (2m) is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to that of the lighter fragment (m). Let me denote the velocities (or momenta) accordingly.\n\nIn classical mechanics, the kinetic energy would be calculated using \u00bdmv\u00b2. But since momentum must be conserved, their momenta must be equal in magnitude. Let me denote the momentum as p for the lighter fragment, so the heavier fragment has momentum -p. \n\nThe classical kinetic energy for each would be (p\u00b2)/(2m) for the lighter, and (p\u00b2)/(2*(2m)) for the heavier. The total kinetic energy is then (p\u00b2/(2m)) + (p\u00b2/(4m)) = (3/4)(p\u00b2/m). But the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV.",

Because even if the velocities are non-relativistic, the energy conservation includes the rest mass energies. But perhaps the difference here is that in the classical calculation, they might have neglected the rest mass change?",

The question asks for the difference between the correct T1 (using relativistic equations) and the classical approximation.\n\nFirst, let's compute the classical case. In classical physics, kinetic energy is (1/2)mv\u00b2. Since the momentum is conserved, the momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite. Let\u2019s denote p as the magnitude of each.

Since m1 = 2 m2, substitute m2 = m1/2. So:\n\nTotal KE classical = p\u00b2/(2 m1) + p\u00b2/(2*(m1/2)) = p\u00b2/(2 m1) + p\u00b2/(m1) = (3/2) p\u00b2/(m1). \n\nBut the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV.

The question asks for the difference between the correct T1 (using relativistic equations) and the classical approximation.\n\nFirst, let's compute the classical case. In classical physics, kinetic energy is (1/2)mv\u00b2. Since the momentum is conserved, the momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite. Let\u2019s denote p as the magnitude of each. So m1 v1 = p \u2192 v1 = p/m1, and m2 v2 = p \u2192 v2 = p/m2. \n\nThe total kinetic energy is (1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + (1/2 m2 v2\u00b2) = (p\u00b2/(2 m1)) + (p\u00b2/(2 m2)). Since m1 = 2 m2, substitute m2 = m1/2. So:\n\nTotal KE classical = p\u00b2/(2 m1) + p\u00b2/(2*(m1/2)) = p\u00b2/(2 m1) + p\u00b2/(m1) = (3/2) p\u00b2/(m1). \n\nBut the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV. So (3/2)(p\u00b2/m1) = 3 GeV \u2192 p\u00b2/m1 = 2 GeV. \n\nBut also, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) in classical is (p\u00b2)/(2 m1). Since T1 = (p\u00b2)/(2 m1), from above, since p\u00b2/m1 is 2 GeV, then T1 is 1 GeV.",

So M = 3m1 / 0.99. \n\nWe need to find T1, which is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m2 = 2m1), and compare it between relativistic and classical calculations.\n\nFirst, let's consider conservation of momentum. Since the nucleus was initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. Therefore, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. So, m2*v2 = -m1*v1. \n\nLet me think of velocities as vectors, but since they are opposite, their magnitudes will satisfy m1*v1 = m2*v2. So, since m2 = 2m1, then v1 = (m2/m1)*v2 = 2v2. \n\nSo the velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. \n\nIn the classical case, kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv\u00b2. Let's compute classical T1 first.\n\nIn classical mechanics: \n\nKinetic energy of the fragments are (1/2)m1 v1\u00b2 and (1/2)m2 v2\u00b2. Since the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, we can write:\n\n(1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + (1/2 m2 v2\u00b2) = 3 GeV. \n\nBut since m2 = 2m1, substitute that in:\n\n(1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + (1/2 *2m1 v2\u00b2) = 3 GeV \u2192 (1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV.\n\nAlso, from momentum conservation, m1 v1 = m2 v2 \u2192 m1 v1 = 2m1 v2 \u2192 v1 = 2v2. \n\nSo substituting v1 = 2v2 into the equation:\n\n(1/2 m1 (2v2)^2) + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV \n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 1/2 m1 *4v2\u00b2 = 2 m1 v2\u00b2 \n\nSecond term: m1 v2\u00b2. \n\nTotal: 2 m1 v2\u00b2 + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV \u2192 m1 v2\u00b2 = 1 GeV. \n\nThen the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m2 = 2m1) is (1/2)(2m1) v2\u00b2 = m1 v2\u00b2 = 1 GeV. \n\nSo in the classical case, T1 (kinetic energy of the more massive fragment) is 1 GeV. \n\nNow, the actual T1 is different. To compute the relativistic case, we need to use relativistic equations. \n\nLet me recall that in relativity, the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Also, momentum is p = \u03b3mv, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. \n\nSince the total momentum is zero, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

The kinetic energy is (Total energy) - (rest mass energy) = (Total energy) - 0.99 M c\u00b2. But also, the total energy must equal the original energy (since energy is conserved). So:\n\nTotal energy after = M c\u00b2 = (E1 + E2)\n\nWhere E1 = gamma1 m1 c\u00b2 (total energy of fragment 1), E2 = gamma2 m2 c\u00b2.\n\nThus, gamma1 m1 c\u00b2 + gamma2 m2 c\u00b2 = M c\u00b2.\n\nAlso, since the system is initially at rest, the total momentum must be zero. Therefore, the momenta of the fragments are equal and opposite. So:\n\ngamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.\n\nBut since they are moving in opposite directions, the magnitudes are equal. So:\n\ngamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2 \u2192 (gamma1 m1 v1)/(gamma2 m2 v2) =1.\n\nHmm, this seems complex. To solve for velocities, perhaps we can set variables and find equations.\n\nLet me denote variables:\n\nLet\u2019s let fragment 1 (more massive) have mass m1 = 2m2 (since it's twice as massive as fragment 2). Let m2 = m, so m1 = 2m. Then m1 + m2 = 3m =0.99 M.\n\nSo m = 0.33 M, m1 =0.66 M, m2 =0.33 M.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the speed of fragment 1 as v1, fragment 2 as v2. Since they are in opposite directions, their velocities are -v1 and v2 (or vice versa), so the momentum equation is:\n\ngamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2. (magnitude-wise, since direction is opposite)\n\nWe also have the energy equation:\n\ngamma1 m1 c\u00b2 + gamma2 m2 c\u00b2 = M c\u00b2.\n\nWe also know that the rest mass energy of the fragments is (m1 + m2)c\u00b2 =0.99 M c\u00b2, so that checks out with the energy equation. The difference M c\u00b2 -0.99 M c\u00b2 =0.01 M c\u00b2 is the total kinetic energy.\n\nWe need to find T1 = (gamma1 -1)m1 c\u00b2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to solving for gamma1 and then computing T1, then subtract the classical value (1 GeV) to find the difference.\n\nThis seems a bit involved. Let me see if there's a way to simplify.\n\nLet me set variables:\n\nLet\u2019s let m2 = m, so m1 = 2m. Then the equations are:\n\nEquation 1: gamma1*(2m)*v1 = gamma2*m*v2 \u2192 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.\n\nEquation 2: gamma1*(2m)c\u00b2 + gamma2*(m)c\u00b2 = M c\u00b2.\n\nAlso, since the rest mass of fragments is 0.99 M, so 2m + m = 3m =0.99 M \u2192 m =0.33 M.\n\nThus, substituting m =0.33 M into equation 2:\n\ngamma1*(2*0.33 M)c\u00b2 + gamma2*(0.33 M)c\u00b2 = M c\u00b2.\n\nDivide both sides by M c\u00b2:\n\ngamma1*(0.66) + gamma2*(0.33) =1.\n\nSo equation 2 becomes 0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 =1.\n\nEquation 1: 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2 \u2192 gamma2 v2 = 2 gamma1 v1.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can express v2 in terms of v1. Let's see.\n\nAssuming that the velocities are along the same line (say, x-axis), with fragment 1 going in +x and fragment 2 in -x, so their velocities are v1 and -v2. The momentum equation would be gamma1 m1 v1 - gamma2 m2 v2 =0 \u2192 gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2. Which is same as equation 1.\n\nSo, let's assume that v2 = k v1. Let me denote k = v2 /v1.\n\nThen equation 1 gives:\n\n2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 (k v1) \u2192 2 gamma1 = gamma2 k \u2192 gamma2 = (2 gamma1)/k.\n\nNow substitute into equation 2:\n\n0.66 gamma1 + 0.33*(2 gamma1 /k) =1 \u2192 0.66 gamma1 + (0.66 gamma1)/k =1 \u2192 gamma1 (0.66 (1 + 1/k) ) =1 \u2192 gamma1 = 1 / [0.66 (1 +1/k) ]\n\nBut we need another relation between v1 and k.

That energy must be the total kinetic energy of the fragments, since they are the only products (no other particles mentioned). \n\nSo the total kinetic energy is (0.01*M)c\u00b2. Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. Let me denote the masses as m1 and m2.

Let their velocities be v1 and v2. Then m1*v1 = -m2*v2. \n\nLet me write momentum conservation: p1 + p2 = 0 \u2192 m1*v1 = -m2*v2. So (2m)v1 = -m v2 \u2192 v2 = -2v1. \n\nThe kinetic energy in classical mechanics is (1/2)m1 v1\u00b2 + (1/2)m2 v2\u00b2. Substitute v2 = -2v1. Then the kinetic energy becomes (1/2)(2m)v1\u00b2 + (1/2)(m)(4v1\u00b2) = (m v1\u00b2) + (2 m v1\u00b2) = 3 m v1\u00b2. \n\nThe total kinetic energy is 3 m v1\u00b2 = (0.01 M)c\u00b2. So solving for v1\u00b2: v1\u00b2 = (0.01 M c\u00b2)/(3 m). But since m is 0.33M, which is (0.99/3) M, so m = (0.99/3) M. \n\nTherefore substituting m:\n\nv1\u00b2 = (0.01 M c\u00b2) / [3*(0.99/3) M)] \u2192 the 3 cancels in denominator, so denominator is 0.99 M \u2192 v1\u00b2 = (0.01 c\u00b2)/(0.99) \u2192 v1 = c * sqrt(0.01/0.99). \n\nBut let's see, actually, perhaps I can proceed numerically.",

So, since m2 = 2m1, then v1 = (m2/m1)*v2 = 2v2. \n\nSo the velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. \n\nIn the classical case, kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv\u00b2. Let's compute classical T1 first.\n\nIn classical mechanics: \n\nKinetic energy of the fragments are (1/2)m1 v1\u00b2 and (1/2)m2 v2\u00b2. Since the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, we can write:\n\n(1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + (1/2 m2 v2\u00b2) = 3 GeV. \n\nBut since m2 = 2m1, substitute that in:\n\n(1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + (1/2 *2m1 v2\u00b2) = 3 GeV \u2192 (1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV.\n\nAlso, from momentum conservation, m1 v1 = m2 v2 \u2192 m1 v1 = 2m1 v2 \u2192 v1 = 2v2. \n\nSo substituting v1 = 2v2 into the equation:\n\n(1/2 m1 (2v2)^2) + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV \n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 1/2 m1 *4v2\u00b2 = 2 m1 v2\u00b2 \n\nSecond term: m1 v2\u00b2. \n\nTotal: 2 m1 v2\u00b2 + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV \u2192 m1 v2\u00b2 = 1 GeV. \n\nThen the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m2 = 2m1) is (1/2)(2m1) v2\u00b2 = m1 v2\u00b2 = 1 GeV. \n\nSo in the classical case, T1 (kinetic energy of the more massive fragment) is 1 GeV. \n\nNow, the actual T1 is different. To compute the relativistic case, we need to use relativistic equations. \n\nLet me recall that in relativity, the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Also, momentum is p = \u03b3mv, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. \n\nSince the total momentum is zero, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let me denote the velocity of the more massive fragment (m2) as v, then the other fragment (m1) must have velocity u such that m2 v = m1 u. Since m2 = 2m1, then 2m1 v = m1 u \u2192 u = 2v. \n\nSo, their velocities are in the ratio 1:2 inversely proportional to their masses, same as in classical case. \n\nNow, the total energy of the system must be conserved. The initial total energy is Mc\u00b2 = 300 GeV. \n\nThe final total energy is the sum of the rest mass energies plus the kinetic energies.",

But that's 99% of the original, so 3m c\u00b2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV \u2192 3m c\u00b2 = 297 GeV. So each fragment's rest mass energy would be m c\u00b2 (for the smaller) and 2m c\u00b2 (for the larger). But okay, moving on.\n\nThe total energy before fission is just the rest mass energy of the nucleus: 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the two fragments plus their kinetic energies. Let me write that equation:\n\nInitial energy: M c\u00b2 = 300 GeV.\n\nFinal energy: (m c\u00b2 + T1) + (2m c\u00b2 + T2) = (3m c\u00b2) + (T1 + T2) \n\nSo, 300 GeV = 3m c\u00b2 + (T1 + T2). Since 3m c\u00b2 is 297 GeV (from earlier), so 300 = 297 + T1 + T2 \u2192 T1 + T2 = 3 GeV. So the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV.\n\nNow, because the nucleus was initially at rest, the momenta of the fragments must be equal and opposite.

So the masses are m = 99, and 2m = 198. Their sum is 297 GeV/c\u00b2, which is 99% of 300. That checks out.\n\nSo now, the total rest mass energy of the fragments is 297 GeV (since each rest mass is multiplied by c\u00b2, so 99 + 198 = 297 GeV). The original mass had a rest energy of 300 GeV, so the difference is 3 GeV. That energy must have been converted into kinetic energy of the fragments. So the total kinetic energy of both fragments is 3 GeV. \n\nBut the problem says, kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. We need to find the difference between the actual T1 (using relativistic equations) and the classical calculation. \n\nFirst, let's think about conservation of momentum. Since the nucleus was initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. Therefore, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. So, the momentum of the more massive fragment (2m) is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to that of the lighter fragment (m).

The problem says \"sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M\". So the mass defect is 0.01*M, so the energy released is (0.01*M)c\u00b2. That energy must be the total kinetic energy of the fragments, since they are the only products (no other particles mentioned). \n\nSo the total kinetic energy is (0.01*M)c\u00b2. Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. Let me denote the masses as m1 and m2. Since m1 = 2*m2, let me let m2 = m, so m1 = 2m. Then m1 + m2 = 3m = 0.99M. Therefore, m = 0.99M/3 \u2248 0.33M. So m1 = 0.66M and m2 = 0.33M.\n\nNow, the total kinetic energy is T1 + T2 = (0.01*M)c\u00b2. The question is to find the difference between T1 (the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, which is m1) calculated relativistically versus classically.\n\nSo, first, let's work out the classical case. In classical mechanics, the system's center of mass is at rest (since initial momentum is zero), so the two fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude but opposite directions. Let their velocities be v1 and v2. Then m1*v1 = -m2*v2. \n\nLet me write momentum conservation: p1 + p2 = 0 \u2192 m1*v1 = -m2*v2. So (2m)v1 = -m v2 \u2192 v2 = -2v1. \n\nThe kinetic energy in classical mechanics is (1/2)m1 v1\u00b2 + (1/2)m2 v2\u00b2. Substitute v2 = -2v1. Then the kinetic energy becomes (1/2)(2m)v1\u00b2 + (1/2)(m)(4v1\u00b2) = (m v1\u00b2) + (2 m v1\u00b2) = 3 m v1\u00b2. \n\nThe total kinetic energy is 3 m v1\u00b2 = (0.01 M)c\u00b2. So solving for v1\u00b2: v1\u00b2 = (0.01 M c\u00b2)/(3 m). But since m is 0.33M, which is (0.99/3) M, so m = (0.99/3) M. \n\nTherefore substituting m:\n\nv1\u00b2 = (0.01 M c\u00b2) / [3*(0.99/3) M)] \u2192 the 3 cancels in denominator, so denominator is 0.99 M \u2192 v1\u00b2 = (0.01 c\u00b2)/(0.99) \u2192 v1 = c * sqrt(0.01/0.99). \n\nBut let's see, actually, perhaps I can proceed numerically.",

But the question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and comparing the actual value with the classical approximation. \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) T1. So I need to calculate both and find their difference. \n\nFirst, let's do the classical case. In classical mechanics, momentum conservation requires that the two fragments have equal and opposite momenta. Let me denote the velocities of the two fragments as v1 and v2. The momentum conservation gives m1 v1 = -m2 v2. Since m2 = 2m, then m v1 = -2m v2 \u2192 v1 = -2 v2.

Since the nucleus was initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. Therefore, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. So, m2*v2 = -m1*v1. \n\nLet me think of velocities as vectors, but since they are opposite, their magnitudes will satisfy m1*v1 = m2*v2. So, since m2 = 2m1, then v1 = (m2/m1)*v2 = 2v2. \n\nSo the velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. \n\nIn the classical case, kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv\u00b2. Let's compute classical T1 first.\n\nIn classical mechanics: \n\nKinetic energy of the fragments are (1/2)m1 v1\u00b2 and (1/2)m2 v2\u00b2. Since the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, we can write:\n\n(1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + (1/2 m2 v2\u00b2) = 3 GeV. \n\nBut since m2 = 2m1, substitute that in:\n\n(1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + (1/2 *2m1 v2\u00b2) = 3 GeV \u2192 (1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV.\n\nAlso, from momentum conservation, m1 v1 = m2 v2 \u2192 m1 v1 = 2m1 v2 \u2192 v1 = 2v2. \n\nSo substituting v1 = 2v2 into the equation:\n\n(1/2 m1 (2v2)^2) + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV \n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 1/2 m1 *4v2\u00b2 = 2 m1 v2\u00b2 \n\nSecond term: m1 v2\u00b2. \n\nTotal: 2 m1 v2\u00b2 + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV \u2192 m1 v2\u00b2 = 1 GeV. \n\nThen the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m2 = 2m1) is (1/2)(2m1) v2\u00b2 = m1 v2\u00b2 = 1 GeV. \n\nSo in the classical case, T1 (kinetic energy of the more massive fragment) is 1 GeV. \n\nNow, the actual T1 is different. To compute the relativistic case, we need to use relativistic equations. \n\nLet me recall that in relativity, the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Also, momentum is p = \u03b3mv, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. \n\nSince the total momentum is zero, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let me denote the velocity of the more massive fragment (m2) as v, then the other fragment (m1) must have velocity u such that m2 v = m1 u. Since m2 = 2m1, then 2m1 v = m1 u \u2192 u = 2v. \n\nSo, their velocities are in the ratio 1:2 inversely proportional to their masses, same as in classical case. \n\nNow, the total energy of the system must be conserved. The initial total energy is Mc\u00b2 = 300 GeV. \n\nThe final total energy is the sum of the rest mass energies plus the kinetic energies.",
          "text2": "Wait, 3m = 0.99M. So m = (0.99M)/3. Let me compute that numerically. Since M is 300 GeV/c\u00b2, then m = 0.99/3 *300 = 0.33*300 = 99 GeV/c\u00b2. So the masses are m = 99, and 2m = 198. Their sum is 297 GeV/c\u00b2, which is 99% of 300. That checks out.\n\nSo now, the total rest mass energy of the fragments is 297 GeV (since each rest mass is multiplied by c\u00b2, so 99 + 198 = 297 GeV). The original mass had a rest energy of 300 GeV, so the difference is 3 GeV. That energy must have been converted into kinetic energy of the fragments. So the total kinetic energy of both fragments is 3 GeV. \n\nBut the problem says, kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. We need to find the difference between the actual T1 (using relativistic equations) and the classical calculation. \n\nFirst, let's think about conservation of momentum. Since the nucleus was initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. Therefore, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. So, the momentum of the more massive fragment (2m) is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to that of the lighter fragment (m). Let me denote the velocities (or momenta) accordingly.\n\nIn classical mechanics, the kinetic energy would be calculated using \u00bdmv\u00b2. But since momentum must be conserved, their momenta must be equal in magnitude. Let me denote the momentum as p for the lighter fragment, so the heavier fragment has momentum -p. \n\nThe classical kinetic energy for each would be (p\u00b2)/(2m) for the lighter, and (p\u00b2)/(2*(2m)) for the heavier. The total kinetic energy is then (p\u00b2/(2m)) + (p\u00b2/(4m)) = (3/4)(p\u00b2/m). But the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV.",

Because even if the velocities are non-relativistic, the energy conservation includes the rest mass energies. But perhaps the difference here is that in the classical calculation, they might have neglected the rest mass change?",

The question asks for the difference between the correct T1 (using relativistic equations) and the classical approximation.\n\nFirst, let's compute the classical case. In classical physics, kinetic energy is (1/2)mv\u00b2. Since the momentum is conserved, the momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite. Let\u2019s denote p as the magnitude of each.

Since m1 = 2 m2, substitute m2 = m1/2. So:\n\nTotal KE classical = p\u00b2/(2 m1) + p\u00b2/(2*(m1/2)) = p\u00b2/(2 m1) + p\u00b2/(m1) = (3/2) p\u00b2/(m1). \n\nBut the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV.

The question asks for the difference between the correct T1 (using relativistic equations) and the classical approximation.\n\nFirst, let's compute the classical case. In classical physics, kinetic energy is (1/2)mv\u00b2. Since the momentum is conserved, the momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite. Let\u2019s denote p as the magnitude of each. So m1 v1 = p \u2192 v1 = p/m1, and m2 v2 = p \u2192 v2 = p/m2. \n\nThe total kinetic energy is (1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + (1/2 m2 v2\u00b2) = (p\u00b2/(2 m1)) + (p\u00b2/(2 m2)). Since m1 = 2 m2, substitute m2 = m1/2. So:\n\nTotal KE classical = p\u00b2/(2 m1) + p\u00b2/(2*(m1/2)) = p\u00b2/(2 m1) + p\u00b2/(m1) = (3/2) p\u00b2/(m1). \n\nBut the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV. So (3/2)(p\u00b2/m1) = 3 GeV \u2192 p\u00b2/m1 = 2 GeV. \n\nBut also, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) in classical is (p\u00b2)/(2 m1). Since T1 = (p\u00b2)/(2 m1), from above, since p\u00b2/m1 is 2 GeV, then T1 is 1 GeV.",

So M = 3m1 / 0.99. \n\nWe need to find T1, which is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m2 = 2m1), and compare it between relativistic and classical calculations.\n\nFirst, let's consider conservation of momentum. Since the nucleus was initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. Therefore, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. So, m2*v2 = -m1*v1. \n\nLet me think of velocities as vectors, but since they are opposite, their magnitudes will satisfy m1*v1 = m2*v2. So, since m2 = 2m1, then v1 = (m2/m1)*v2 = 2v2. \n\nSo the velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. \n\nIn the classical case, kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv\u00b2. Let's compute classical T1 first.\n\nIn classical mechanics: \n\nKinetic energy of the fragments are (1/2)m1 v1\u00b2 and (1/2)m2 v2\u00b2. Since the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, we can write:\n\n(1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + (1/2 m2 v2\u00b2) = 3 GeV. \n\nBut since m2 = 2m1, substitute that in:\n\n(1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + (1/2 *2m1 v2\u00b2) = 3 GeV \u2192 (1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV.\n\nAlso, from momentum conservation, m1 v1 = m2 v2 \u2192 m1 v1 = 2m1 v2 \u2192 v1 = 2v2. \n\nSo substituting v1 = 2v2 into the equation:\n\n(1/2 m1 (2v2)^2) + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV \n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 1/2 m1 *4v2\u00b2 = 2 m1 v2\u00b2 \n\nSecond term: m1 v2\u00b2. \n\nTotal: 2 m1 v2\u00b2 + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV \u2192 m1 v2\u00b2 = 1 GeV. \n\nThen the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m2 = 2m1) is (1/2)(2m1) v2\u00b2 = m1 v2\u00b2 = 1 GeV. \n\nSo in the classical case, T1 (kinetic energy of the more massive fragment) is 1 GeV. \n\nNow, the actual T1 is different. To compute the relativistic case, we need to use relativistic equations. \n\nLet me recall that in relativity, the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Also, momentum is p = \u03b3mv, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. \n\nSince the total momentum is zero, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

The kinetic energy is (Total energy) - (rest mass energy) = (Total energy) - 0.99 M c\u00b2. But also, the total energy must equal the original energy (since energy is conserved). So:\n\nTotal energy after = M c\u00b2 = (E1 + E2)\n\nWhere E1 = gamma1 m1 c\u00b2 (total energy of fragment 1), E2 = gamma2 m2 c\u00b2.\n\nThus, gamma1 m1 c\u00b2 + gamma2 m2 c\u00b2 = M c\u00b2.\n\nAlso, since the system is initially at rest, the total momentum must be zero. Therefore, the momenta of the fragments are equal and opposite. So:\n\ngamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.\n\nBut since they are moving in opposite directions, the magnitudes are equal. So:\n\ngamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2 \u2192 (gamma1 m1 v1)/(gamma2 m2 v2) =1.\n\nHmm, this seems complex. To solve for velocities, perhaps we can set variables and find equations.\n\nLet me denote variables:\n\nLet\u2019s let fragment 1 (more massive) have mass m1 = 2m2 (since it's twice as massive as fragment 2). Let m2 = m, so m1 = 2m. Then m1 + m2 = 3m =0.99 M.\n\nSo m = 0.33 M, m1 =0.66 M, m2 =0.33 M.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the speed of fragment 1 as v1, fragment 2 as v2. Since they are in opposite directions, their velocities are -v1 and v2 (or vice versa), so the momentum equation is:\n\ngamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2. (magnitude-wise, since direction is opposite)\n\nWe also have the energy equation:\n\ngamma1 m1 c\u00b2 + gamma2 m2 c\u00b2 = M c\u00b2.\n\nWe also know that the rest mass energy of the fragments is (m1 + m2)c\u00b2 =0.99 M c\u00b2, so that checks out with the energy equation. The difference M c\u00b2 -0.99 M c\u00b2 =0.01 M c\u00b2 is the total kinetic energy.\n\nWe need to find T1 = (gamma1 -1)m1 c\u00b2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to solving for gamma1 and then computing T1, then subtract the classical value (1 GeV) to find the difference.\n\nThis seems a bit involved. Let me see if there's a way to simplify.\n\nLet me set variables:\n\nLet\u2019s let m2 = m, so m1 = 2m. Then the equations are:\n\nEquation 1: gamma1*(2m)*v1 = gamma2*m*v2 \u2192 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.\n\nEquation 2: gamma1*(2m)c\u00b2 + gamma2*(m)c\u00b2 = M c\u00b2.\n\nAlso, since the rest mass of fragments is 0.99 M, so 2m + m = 3m =0.99 M \u2192 m =0.33 M.\n\nThus, substituting m =0.33 M into equation 2:\n\ngamma1*(2*0.33 M)c\u00b2 + gamma2*(0.33 M)c\u00b2 = M c\u00b2.\n\nDivide both sides by M c\u00b2:\n\ngamma1*(0.66) + gamma2*(0.33) =1.\n\nSo equation 2 becomes 0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 =1.\n\nEquation 1: 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2 \u2192 gamma2 v2 = 2 gamma1 v1.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can express v2 in terms of v1. Let's see.\n\nAssuming that the velocities are along the same line (say, x-axis), with fragment 1 going in +x and fragment 2 in -x, so their velocities are v1 and -v2. The momentum equation would be gamma1 m1 v1 - gamma2 m2 v2 =0 \u2192 gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2. Which is same as equation 1.\n\nSo, let's assume that v2 = k v1. Let me denote k = v2 /v1.\n\nThen equation 1 gives:\n\n2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 (k v1) \u2192 2 gamma1 = gamma2 k \u2192 gamma2 = (2 gamma1)/k.\n\nNow substitute into equation 2:\n\n0.66 gamma1 + 0.33*(2 gamma1 /k) =1 \u2192 0.66 gamma1 + (0.66 gamma1)/k =1 \u2192 gamma1 (0.66 (1 + 1/k) ) =1 \u2192 gamma1 = 1 / [0.66 (1 +1/k) ]\n\nBut we need another relation between v1 and k.

That energy must be the total kinetic energy of the fragments, since they are the only products (no other particles mentioned). \n\nSo the total kinetic energy is (0.01*M)c\u00b2. Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. Let me denote the masses as m1 and m2.

Let their velocities be v1 and v2. Then m1*v1 = -m2*v2. \n\nLet me write momentum conservation: p1 + p2 = 0 \u2192 m1*v1 = -m2*v2. So (2m)v1 = -m v2 \u2192 v2 = -2v1. \n\nThe kinetic energy in classical mechanics is (1/2)m1 v1\u00b2 + (1/2)m2 v2\u00b2. Substitute v2 = -2v1. Then the kinetic energy becomes (1/2)(2m)v1\u00b2 + (1/2)(m)(4v1\u00b2) = (m v1\u00b2) + (2 m v1\u00b2) = 3 m v1\u00b2. \n\nThe total kinetic energy is 3 m v1\u00b2 = (0.01 M)c\u00b2. So solving for v1\u00b2: v1\u00b2 = (0.01 M c\u00b2)/(3 m). But since m is 0.33M, which is (0.99/3) M, so m = (0.99/3) M. \n\nTherefore substituting m:\n\nv1\u00b2 = (0.01 M c\u00b2) / [3*(0.99/3) M)] \u2192 the 3 cancels in denominator, so denominator is 0.99 M \u2192 v1\u00b2 = (0.01 c\u00b2)/(0.99) \u2192 v1 = c * sqrt(0.01/0.99). \n\nBut let's see, actually, perhaps I can proceed numerically.",

So, since m2 = 2m1, then v1 = (m2/m1)*v2 = 2v2. \n\nSo the velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. \n\nIn the classical case, kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv\u00b2. Let's compute classical T1 first.\n\nIn classical mechanics: \n\nKinetic energy of the fragments are (1/2)m1 v1\u00b2 and (1/2)m2 v2\u00b2. Since the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, we can write:\n\n(1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + (1/2 m2 v2\u00b2) = 3 GeV. \n\nBut since m2 = 2m1, substitute that in:\n\n(1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + (1/2 *2m1 v2\u00b2) = 3 GeV \u2192 (1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV.\n\nAlso, from momentum conservation, m1 v1 = m2 v2 \u2192 m1 v1 = 2m1 v2 \u2192 v1 = 2v2. \n\nSo substituting v1 = 2v2 into the equation:\n\n(1/2 m1 (2v2)^2) + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV \n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 1/2 m1 *4v2\u00b2 = 2 m1 v2\u00b2 \n\nSecond term: m1 v2\u00b2. \n\nTotal: 2 m1 v2\u00b2 + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV \u2192 m1 v2\u00b2 = 1 GeV. \n\nThen the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m2 = 2m1) is (1/2)(2m1) v2\u00b2 = m1 v2\u00b2 = 1 GeV. \n\nSo in the classical case, T1 (kinetic energy of the more massive fragment) is 1 GeV. \n\nNow, the actual T1 is different. To compute the relativistic case, we need to use relativistic equations. \n\nLet me recall that in relativity, the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Also, momentum is p = \u03b3mv, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. \n\nSince the total momentum is zero, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let me denote the velocity of the more massive fragment (m2) as v, then the other fragment (m1) must have velocity u such that m2 v = m1 u. Since m2 = 2m1, then 2m1 v = m1 u \u2192 u = 2v. \n\nSo, their velocities are in the ratio 1:2 inversely proportional to their masses, same as in classical case. \n\nNow, the total energy of the system must be conserved. The initial total energy is Mc\u00b2 = 300 GeV. \n\nThe final total energy is the sum of the rest mass energies plus the kinetic energies.",

But that's 99% of the original, so 3m c\u00b2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV \u2192 3m c\u00b2 = 297 GeV. So each fragment's rest mass energy would be m c\u00b2 (for the smaller) and 2m c\u00b2 (for the larger). But okay, moving on.\n\nThe total energy before fission is just the rest mass energy of the nucleus: 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the two fragments plus their kinetic energies. Let me write that equation:\n\nInitial energy: M c\u00b2 = 300 GeV.\n\nFinal energy: (m c\u00b2 + T1) + (2m c\u00b2 + T2) = (3m c\u00b2) + (T1 + T2) \n\nSo, 300 GeV = 3m c\u00b2 + (T1 + T2). Since 3m c\u00b2 is 297 GeV (from earlier), so 300 = 297 + T1 + T2 \u2192 T1 + T2 = 3 GeV. So the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV.\n\nNow, because the nucleus was initially at rest, the momenta of the fragments must be equal and opposite.

So the masses are m = 99, and 2m = 198. Their sum is 297 GeV/c\u00b2, which is 99% of 300. That checks out.\n\nSo now, the total rest mass energy of the fragments is 297 GeV (since each rest mass is multiplied by c\u00b2, so 99 + 198 = 297 GeV). The original mass had a rest energy of 300 GeV, so the difference is 3 GeV. That energy must have been converted into kinetic energy of the fragments. So the total kinetic energy of both fragments is 3 GeV. \n\nBut the problem says, kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. We need to find the difference between the actual T1 (using relativistic equations) and the classical calculation. \n\nFirst, let's think about conservation of momentum. Since the nucleus was initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. Therefore, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. So, the momentum of the more massive fragment (2m) is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to that of the lighter fragment (m).

The problem says \"sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M\". So the mass defect is 0.01*M, so the energy released is (0.01*M)c\u00b2. That energy must be the total kinetic energy of the fragments, since they are the only products (no other particles mentioned). \n\nSo the total kinetic energy is (0.01*M)c\u00b2. Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. Let me denote the masses as m1 and m2. Since m1 = 2*m2, let me let m2 = m, so m1 = 2m. Then m1 + m2 = 3m = 0.99M. Therefore, m = 0.99M/3 \u2248 0.33M. So m1 = 0.66M and m2 = 0.33M.\n\nNow, the total kinetic energy is T1 + T2 = (0.01*M)c\u00b2. The question is to find the difference between T1 (the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, which is m1) calculated relativistically versus classically.\n\nSo, first, let's work out the classical case. In classical mechanics, the system's center of mass is at rest (since initial momentum is zero), so the two fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude but opposite directions. Let their velocities be v1 and v2. Then m1*v1 = -m2*v2. \n\nLet me write momentum conservation: p1 + p2 = 0 \u2192 m1*v1 = -m2*v2. So (2m)v1 = -m v2 \u2192 v2 = -2v1. \n\nThe kinetic energy in classical mechanics is (1/2)m1 v1\u00b2 + (1/2)m2 v2\u00b2. Substitute v2 = -2v1. Then the kinetic energy becomes (1/2)(2m)v1\u00b2 + (1/2)(m)(4v1\u00b2) = (m v1\u00b2) + (2 m v1\u00b2) = 3 m v1\u00b2. \n\nThe total kinetic energy is 3 m v1\u00b2 = (0.01 M)c\u00b2. So solving for v1\u00b2: v1\u00b2 = (0.01 M c\u00b2)/(3 m). But since m is 0.33M, which is (0.99/3) M, so m = (0.99/3) M. \n\nTherefore substituting m:\n\nv1\u00b2 = (0.01 M c\u00b2) / [3*(0.99/3) M)] \u2192 the 3 cancels in denominator, so denominator is 0.99 M \u2192 v1\u00b2 = (0.01 c\u00b2)/(0.99) \u2192 v1 = c * sqrt(0.01/0.99). \n\nBut let's see, actually, perhaps I can proceed numerically.",

But the question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and comparing the actual value with the classical approximation. \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) T1. So I need to calculate both and find their difference. \n\nFirst, let's do the classical case. In classical mechanics, momentum conservation requires that the two fragments have equal and opposite momenta. Let me denote the velocities of the two fragments as v1 and v2. The momentum conservation gives m1 v1 = -m2 v2. Since m2 = 2m, then m v1 = -2m v2 \u2192 v1 = -2 v2.

Since the nucleus was initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. Therefore, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. So, m2*v2 = -m1*v1. \n\nLet me think of velocities as vectors, but since they are opposite, their magnitudes will satisfy m1*v1 = m2*v2. So, since m2 = 2m1, then v1 = (m2/m1)*v2 = 2v2. \n\nSo the velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. \n\nIn the classical case, kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv\u00b2. Let's compute classical T1 first.\n\nIn classical mechanics: \n\nKinetic energy of the fragments are (1/2)m1 v1\u00b2 and (1/2)m2 v2\u00b2. Since the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, we can write:\n\n(1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + (1/2 m2 v2\u00b2) = 3 GeV. \n\nBut since m2 = 2m1, substitute that in:\n\n(1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + (1/2 *2m1 v2\u00b2) = 3 GeV \u2192 (1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV.\n\nAlso, from momentum conservation, m1 v1 = m2 v2 \u2192 m1 v1 = 2m1 v2 \u2192 v1 = 2v2. \n\nSo substituting v1 = 2v2 into the equation:\n\n(1/2 m1 (2v2)^2) + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV \n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 1/2 m1 *4v2\u00b2 = 2 m1 v2\u00b2 \n\nSecond term: m1 v2\u00b2. \n\nTotal: 2 m1 v2\u00b2 + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV \u2192 m1 v2\u00b2 = 1 GeV. \n\nThen the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m2 = 2m1) is (1/2)(2m1) v2\u00b2 = m1 v2\u00b2 = 1 GeV. \n\nSo in the classical case, T1 (kinetic energy of the more massive fragment) is 1 GeV. \n\nNow, the actual T1 is different. To compute the relativistic case, we need to use relativistic equations. \n\nLet me recall that in relativity, the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Also, momentum is p = \u03b3mv, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. \n\nSince the total momentum is zero, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let me denote the velocity of the more massive fragment (m2) as v, then the other fragment (m1) must have velocity u such that m2 v = m1 u. Since m2 = 2m1, then 2m1 v = m1 u \u2192 u = 2v. \n\nSo, their velocities are in the ratio 1:2 inversely proportional to their masses, same as in classical case. \n\nNow, the total energy of the system must be conserved. The initial total energy is Mc\u00b2 = 300 GeV. \n\nThe final total energy is the sum of the rest mass energies plus the kinetic energies.",
          "text2": "Wait, 3m = 0.99M. So m = (0.99M)/3. Let me compute that numerically. Since M is 300 GeV/c\u00b2, then m = 0.99/3 *300 = 0.33*300 = 99 GeV/c\u00b2. So the masses are m = 99, and 2m = 198. Their sum is 297 GeV/c\u00b2, which is 99% of 300. That checks out.\n\nSo now, the total rest mass energy of the fragments is 297 GeV (since each rest mass is multiplied by c\u00b2, so 99 + 198 = 297 GeV). The original mass had a rest energy of 300 GeV, so the difference is 3 GeV. That energy must have been converted into kinetic energy of the fragments. So the total kinetic energy of both fragments is 3 GeV. \n\nBut the problem says, kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. We need to find the difference between the actual T1 (using relativistic equations) and the classical calculation. \n\nFirst, let's think about conservation of momentum. Since the nucleus was initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. Therefore, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. So, the momentum of the more massive fragment (2m) is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to that of the lighter fragment (m). Let me denote the velocities (or momenta) accordingly.\n\nIn classical mechanics, the kinetic energy would be calculated using \u00bdmv\u00b2. But since momentum must be conserved, their momenta must be equal in magnitude. Let me denote the momentum as p for the lighter fragment, so the heavier fragment has momentum -p. \n\nThe classical kinetic energy for each would be (p\u00b2)/(2m) for the lighter, and (p\u00b2)/(2*(2m)) for the heavier. The total kinetic energy is then (p\u00b2/(2m)) + (p\u00b2/(4m)) = (3/4)(p\u00b2/m). But the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV.",

Because even if the velocities are non-relativistic, the energy conservation includes the rest mass energies. But perhaps the difference here is that in the classical calculation, they might have neglected the rest mass change?",

The question asks for the difference between the correct T1 (using relativistic equations) and the classical approximation.\n\nFirst, let's compute the classical case. In classical physics, kinetic energy is (1/2)mv\u00b2. Since the momentum is conserved, the momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite. Let\u2019s denote p as the magnitude of each.

Since m1 = 2 m2, substitute m2 = m1/2. So:\n\nTotal KE classical = p\u00b2/(2 m1) + p\u00b2/(2*(m1/2)) = p\u00b2/(2 m1) + p\u00b2/(m1) = (3/2) p\u00b2/(m1). \n\nBut the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV.

The question asks for the difference between the correct T1 (using relativistic equations) and the classical approximation.\n\nFirst, let's compute the classical case. In classical physics, kinetic energy is (1/2)mv\u00b2. Since the momentum is conserved, the momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite. Let\u2019s denote p as the magnitude of each. So m1 v1 = p \u2192 v1 = p/m1, and m2 v2 = p \u2192 v2 = p/m2. \n\nThe total kinetic energy is (1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + (1/2 m2 v2\u00b2) = (p\u00b2/(2 m1)) + (p\u00b2/(2 m2)). Since m1 = 2 m2, substitute m2 = m1/2. So:\n\nTotal KE classical = p\u00b2/(2 m1) + p\u00b2/(2*(m1/2)) = p\u00b2/(2 m1) + p\u00b2/(m1) = (3/2) p\u00b2/(m1). \n\nBut the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV. So (3/2)(p\u00b2/m1) = 3 GeV \u2192 p\u00b2/m1 = 2 GeV. \n\nBut also, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) in classical is (p\u00b2)/(2 m1). Since T1 = (p\u00b2)/(2 m1), from above, since p\u00b2/m1 is 2 GeV, then T1 is 1 GeV.",

So M = 3m1 / 0.99. \n\nWe need to find T1, which is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m2 = 2m1), and compare it between relativistic and classical calculations.\n\nFirst, let's consider conservation of momentum. Since the nucleus was initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. Therefore, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. So, m2*v2 = -m1*v1. \n\nLet me think of velocities as vectors, but since they are opposite, their magnitudes will satisfy m1*v1 = m2*v2. So, since m2 = 2m1, then v1 = (m2/m1)*v2 = 2v2. \n\nSo the velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. \n\nIn the classical case, kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv\u00b2. Let's compute classical T1 first.\n\nIn classical mechanics: \n\nKinetic energy of the fragments are (1/2)m1 v1\u00b2 and (1/2)m2 v2\u00b2. Since the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, we can write:\n\n(1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + (1/2 m2 v2\u00b2) = 3 GeV. \n\nBut since m2 = 2m1, substitute that in:\n\n(1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + (1/2 *2m1 v2\u00b2) = 3 GeV \u2192 (1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV.\n\nAlso, from momentum conservation, m1 v1 = m2 v2 \u2192 m1 v1 = 2m1 v2 \u2192 v1 = 2v2. \n\nSo substituting v1 = 2v2 into the equation:\n\n(1/2 m1 (2v2)^2) + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV \n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 1/2 m1 *4v2\u00b2 = 2 m1 v2\u00b2 \n\nSecond term: m1 v2\u00b2. \n\nTotal: 2 m1 v2\u00b2 + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV \u2192 m1 v2\u00b2 = 1 GeV. \n\nThen the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m2 = 2m1) is (1/2)(2m1) v2\u00b2 = m1 v2\u00b2 = 1 GeV. \n\nSo in the classical case, T1 (kinetic energy of the more massive fragment) is 1 GeV. \n\nNow, the actual T1 is different. To compute the relativistic case, we need to use relativistic equations. \n\nLet me recall that in relativity, the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Also, momentum is p = \u03b3mv, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. \n\nSince the total momentum is zero, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So, up to the second term, we get E \u2248 m + (p^2)/(2m), which is the classical expression. \n\nSo if we plug that into the equation E1 + E2 = 300 GeV, then:\n\n( m1 + p^2 / (2 m1) ) + ( m2 + p^2/(2 m2) ) \u2248 300 GeV.\n\nBut m1 + m2 = 0.99 M0 = 0.99*300 = 297 GeV.

The kinetic energy is (Total energy) - (rest mass energy) = (Total energy) - 0.99 M c\u00b2. But also, the total energy must equal the original energy (since energy is conserved). So:\n\nTotal energy after = M c\u00b2 = (E1 + E2)\n\nWhere E1 = gamma1 m1 c\u00b2 (total energy of fragment 1), E2 = gamma2 m2 c\u00b2.\n\nThus, gamma1 m1 c\u00b2 + gamma2 m2 c\u00b2 = M c\u00b2.\n\nAlso, since the system is initially at rest, the total momentum must be zero. Therefore, the momenta of the fragments are equal and opposite. So:\n\ngamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.\n\nBut since they are moving in opposite directions, the magnitudes are equal. So:\n\ngamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2 \u2192 (gamma1 m1 v1)/(gamma2 m2 v2) =1.\n\nHmm, this seems complex. To solve for velocities, perhaps we can set variables and find equations.\n\nLet me denote variables:\n\nLet\u2019s let fragment 1 (more massive) have mass m1 = 2m2 (since it's twice as massive as fragment 2). Let m2 = m, so m1 = 2m. Then m1 + m2 = 3m =0.99 M.\n\nSo m = 0.33 M, m1 =0.66 M, m2 =0.33 M.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the speed of fragment 1 as v1, fragment 2 as v2. Since they are in opposite directions, their velocities are -v1 and v2 (or vice versa), so the momentum equation is:\n\ngamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2. (magnitude-wise, since direction is opposite)\n\nWe also have the energy equation:\n\ngamma1 m1 c\u00b2 + gamma2 m2 c\u00b2 = M c\u00b2.\n\nWe also know that the rest mass energy of the fragments is (m1 + m2)c\u00b2 =0.99 M c\u00b2, so that checks out with the energy equation. The difference M c\u00b2 -0.99 M c\u00b2 =0.01 M c\u00b2 is the total kinetic energy.\n\nWe need to find T1 = (gamma1 -1)m1 c\u00b2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to solving for gamma1 and then computing T1, then subtract the classical value (1 GeV) to find the difference.\n\nThis seems a bit involved. Let me see if there's a way to simplify.\n\nLet me set variables:\n\nLet\u2019s let m2 = m, so m1 = 2m. Then the equations are:\n\nEquation 1: gamma1*(2m)*v1 = gamma2*m*v2 \u2192 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.\n\nEquation 2: gamma1*(2m)c\u00b2 + gamma2*(m)c\u00b2 = M c\u00b2.\n\nAlso, since the rest mass of fragments is 0.99 M, so 2m + m = 3m =0.99 M \u2192 m =0.33 M.\n\nThus, substituting m =0.33 M into equation 2:\n\ngamma1*(2*0.33 M)c\u00b2 + gamma2*(0.33 M)c\u00b2 = M c\u00b2.\n\nDivide both sides by M c\u00b2:\n\ngamma1*(0.66) + gamma2*(0.33) =1.\n\nSo equation 2 becomes 0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 =1.\n\nEquation 1: 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2 \u2192 gamma2 v2 = 2 gamma1 v1.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can express v2 in terms of v1. Let's see.\n\nAssuming that the velocities are along the same line (say, x-axis), with fragment 1 going in +x and fragment 2 in -x, so their velocities are v1 and -v2. The momentum equation would be gamma1 m1 v1 - gamma2 m2 v2 =0 \u2192 gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2. Which is same as equation 1.\n\nSo, let's assume that v2 = k v1. Let me denote k = v2 /v1.\n\nThen equation 1 gives:\n\n2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 (k v1) \u2192 2 gamma1 = gamma2 k \u2192 gamma2 = (2 gamma1)/k.\n\nNow substitute into equation 2:\n\n0.66 gamma1 + 0.33*(2 gamma1 /k) =1 \u2192 0.66 gamma1 + (0.66 gamma1)/k =1 \u2192 gamma1 (0.66 (1 + 1/k) ) =1 \u2192 gamma1 = 1 / [0.66 (1 +1/k) ]\n\nBut we need another relation between v1 and k.

That energy must be the total kinetic energy of the fragments, since they are the only products (no other particles mentioned). \n\nSo the total kinetic energy is (0.01*M)c\u00b2. Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. Let me denote the masses as m1 and m2.

Then the kinetic energy becomes (1/2)(2m)v1\u00b2 + (1/2)(m)(4v1\u00b2) = (m v1\u00b2) + (2 m v1\u00b2) = 3 m v1\u00b2. \n\nThe total kinetic energy is 3 m v1\u00b2 = (0.01 M)c\u00b2. So solving for v1\u00b2: v1\u00b2 = (0.01 M c\u00b2)/(3 m). But since m is 0.33M, which is (0.99/3) M, so m = (0.99/3) M. \n\nTherefore substituting m:\n\nv1\u00b2 = (0.01 M c\u00b2) / [3*(0.99/3) M)] \u2192 the 3 cancels in denominator, so denominator is 0.99 M \u2192 v1\u00b2 = (0.01 c\u00b2)/(0.99) \u2192 v1 = c * sqrt(0.01/0.99). \n\nBut let's see, actually, perhaps I can proceed numerically.",

So T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.\n\nNow, to find T1 (the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, which is m1 = 2m), we need to find how the kinetic energy is divided between the two fragments. \n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is (p\u00b2)/(2m).

So, m2*v2 = -m1*v1. \n\nLet me think of velocities as vectors, but since they are opposite, their magnitudes will satisfy m1*v1 = m2*v2.

So M = 3m1 / 0.99. \n\nWe need to find T1, which is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m2 = 2m1), and compare it between relativistic and classical calculations.\n\nFirst, let's consider conservation of momentum. Since the nucleus was initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. Therefore, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. So, m2*v2 = -m1*v1. \n\nLet me think of velocities as vectors, but since they are opposite, their magnitudes will satisfy m1*v1 = m2*v2. So, since m2 = 2m1, then v1 = (m2/m1)*v2 = 2v2. \n\nSo the velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. \n\nIn the classical case, kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv\u00b2. Let's compute classical T1 first.\n\nIn classical mechanics: \n\nKinetic energy of the fragments are (1/2)m1 v1\u00b2 and (1/2)m2 v2\u00b2. Since the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, we can write:\n\n(1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + (1/2 m2 v2\u00b2) = 3 GeV. \n\nBut since m2 = 2m1, substitute that in:\n\n(1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + (1/2 *2m1 v2\u00b2) = 3 GeV \u2192 (1/2 m1 v1\u00b2) + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV.\n\nAlso, from momentum conservation, m1 v1 = m2 v2 \u2192 m1 v1 = 2m1 v2 \u2192 v1 = 2v2. \n\nSo substituting v1 = 2v2 into the equation:\n\n(1/2 m1 (2v2)^2) + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV \n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 1/2 m1 *4v2\u00b2 = 2 m1 v2\u00b2 \n\nSecond term: m1 v2\u00b2. \n\nTotal: 2 m1 v2\u00b2 + m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 m1 v2\u00b2 = 3 GeV \u2192 m1 v2\u00b2 = 1 GeV. \n\nThen the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m2 = 2m1) is (1/2)(2m1) v2\u00b2 = m1 v2\u00b2 = 1 GeV. \n\nSo in the classical case, T1 (kinetic energy of the more massive fragment) is 1 GeV. \n\nNow, the actual T1 is different. To compute the relativistic case, we need to use relativistic equations. \n\nLet me recall that in relativity, the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Also, momentum is p = \u03b3mv, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. \n\nSince the total momentum is zero, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let me denote the velocity of the more massive fragment (m2) as v, then the other fragment (m1) must have velocity u such that m2 v = m1 u. Since m2 = 2m1, then 2m1 v = m1 u \u2192 u = 2v. \n\nSo, their velocities are in the ratio 1:2 inversely proportional to their masses, same as in classical case. \n\nNow, the total energy of the system must be conserved.

Also, momentum is p = \u03b3mv, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. \n\nSince the total momentum is zero, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let me denote the velocity of the more massive fragment (m2) as v, then the other fragment (m1) must have velocity u such that m2 v = m1 u. Since m2 = 2m1, then 2m1 v = m1 u \u2192 u = 2v. \n\nSo, their velocities are in the ratio 1:2 inversely proportional to their masses, same as in classical case. \n\nNow, the total energy of the system must be conserved. The initial total energy is Mc\u00b2 = 300 GeV. \n\nThe final total energy is the sum of the rest mass energies plus the kinetic energies.",
