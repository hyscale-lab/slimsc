          "text2": "Wait, in dimethyl fumarate's case, the carbons adjacent to the double bond are CH groups. For example, each has two substituents. The left carbon in the double bond is connected to COOCH3 and the double bond. The right carbon is connected to COOCH3 (wait no, both ends have the same groups). So both carbons in the double bond have the same substituents, so no chiral centers. \n\nHmm. So I'm back to thinking that only compound 2 is correct, but that's not an option.",
