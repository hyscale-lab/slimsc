          "text1": "Wait, the double mutants with G2 knocked out (like g1g2, g2g3) all have 0% resistance. Because when G2 is knocked out, regardless of other genes, the plant is 0% resistant. So G2 is essential. That suggests that G2 is a transcription factor that's necessary for the expression of the other genes. Because if G2 is knocked out, then even if G1 and G3 are present, they might not be expressed? But then why does the g1g2 mutant have 0%? Because G2 is already off, so the others can't matter. But if G2 is a TF that's required for the expression of G1 and G3, then in the absence of G2, those genes wouldn't be active, so their presence or absence wouldn't matter. Hence, all mutants with G2 knocked out are 0%.\n\nLooking at the g2 single mutant: 0%, which makes sense. The double mutants with G2 and another (g1g2, g2g3) also 0%, so that's consistent. So G2 is the key here. So the TF is likely G2.\n\nNow, the other genes (G1 and G3) must be downstream of G2. So their activity depends on G2. Let's look at their single mutants. The g1 single mutant has 75% resistance. So losing G1 reduces resistance by 25%, but there's still some. The g3 single has 50%, so losing G3 cuts resistance by half. Since G2 is a TF, maybe both G1 and G3 are downstream and contribute to resistance. \n\nNow, the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. Which is way lower than the sum of their individual effects.",
          "text2": "Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a key gene that when knocked out, the plant is completely susceptible. So maybe G2 is essential for resistance. But then why do the other single mutants have some resistance left? For instance, the g1 mutant has 75%, so losing G1 reduces resistance but doesn't eliminate it. So G1's function might be contributing but not essential. \n\nLooking at the double mutants:\n\n- g1g2: 0% resistance. But since g2 alone is already 0%, that's the same. So knocking out G1 in addition to G2 doesn't make it worse. That suggests that G1 might be downstream of G2. Because if G2 is already knocked out, G1's absence doesn't add anything. So maybe G1's function is dependent on G2 being present. \n\nSimilarly, g2g3: same as g2 (0%). So removing G3 when G2 is already gone doesn't change anything. So G3 is also dependent on G2. \n\nNow the g1g3 double mutant has 10% resistance. That's worse than either single mutant (g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%). So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance drops further. That suggests that G1 and G3 might be redundant. Because together, their loss causes a more severe phenotype than either alone. \n\nSo redundancy would mean that G1 and G3 have overlapping functions. When both are missing, the combined effect is worse than either alone. \n\nPutting this together: If G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would prevent both genes from being expressed. Hence, the g2 mutant has 0% resistance because without G2, neither G1 nor G3 is expressed, so no resistance. \n\nThe single mutants g1 and g3 have some resistance left, which would come from the other gene. For example, in g1, G3 is still functional, so maybe G3 can provide some resistance, but not as much as the full system. Similarly, in g3, G1 is still present. \n\nThe double mutant g1g3 would have neither G1 nor G3, so they can't contribute, but since G2 is still present (since it's only g1g3, not g2g1g3), wait no\u2014wait, in the g1g3 mutant, G2 is still present.",

So maybe in the presence of G2, G1's loss isn't as bad? Not sure. The double mutants might need to be considered here. Hmm.\n\nOption B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter. G3 is epistatic to G1.\n\nSame promoter might mean they are regulated similarly. But how does that fit? If G2 is a TF, maybe it regulates both. Then G1 and G3's effects are downstream. If G3 is epistatic over G1, then G3's effect is dominant. The double g1g3 would then depend on G3's function. But the g1g3 has 10%, which is lower than G3's 50%. Hmm.\n\nOption C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic to G3.\n\nPleiotropy would mean each gene has multiple effects. Epistasis here would mean G1 masks G3's effect. But not sure how that plays into the resistance levels.\n\nOption D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have redundancy, G1 is epistatic to G3.\n\nRedundancy would explain why their combined knockout (g1g3) is worse than either alone, but not as bad as the 0% from g2. Since the redundancy would mean that each can compensate some function. If they are redundant, their combined knockout removes both backup functions, leading to lower resistance. But G2 is a TF acting upstream. Let me see.\n\nIf G2 is a TF that controls both G1 and G3, then without G2, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed. So in g2, their absence would lead to 0%, which matches. But then, in the double mutant g1g3 (both genes knocked out), the resistance is 10%, which is better than 0. That's a problem because if G2's knockout leads to no G1 or G3, then the effect of g1g3 (both knocked out) should be the same as g2. But in reality, g1g3 has 10%, which is better than 0. Therefore, this suggests that G2's loss doesn't completely negate G1 and G3's functions. So perhaps G2 is a TF that's upstream of G1 and G3, but not the only factor?",

But how does that play with the data? Let's see. If G1 is epistatic over G3, then when G1 is knocked out, maybe the effect of G3 is unmasked. But not sure.\n\nOption D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy (so they can back each other up; maybe they're in parallel pathways), and G1 is epistatic over G3. If they are redundant, then if one is knocked out, the other can compensate. So for example, the single mutants (g1 and g3) would have some resistance because the other is still present. The double mutant g1g3 would lose both, leading to lower resistance. Let's see the data. \n\nLooking at the data again, when G1 is knocked out, resistance is 75%. When G3 is knocked out, it's 50%. The double g1g3 has 10%. That suggests that together, their loss causes a much bigger problem. If they are redundant, then the single knockouts would have partial loss, but together, the combined effect is worse. So redundancy makes sense here. \n\nAlso, since G2 is a TF, maybe it's regulating both G1 and G3. Since when G2 is knocked out (as in g2, g1g2, g2g3), resistance is 0. That suggests that without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can function. So G2 is necessary for their expression or activity. \n\nNow, looking at the epistatic relationship. If G1 is epistatic over G3, that would mean that G1's function is upstream of G3, so if G1 is present, G3 can't compensate? Or maybe that G1's mutation masks the effect of G3. For example, if G1 is knocked out, then G3's effect isn't as effective.",

Thus, removing G1 on top of G2's absence doesn't change the outcome. \n\nSimilarly, removing G3 with G2 (g2g3) also gives 0%, so G3's presence or absence doesn't matter when G2 is gone. \n\nNow, the double mutant g1g3 has 10%. Since G2 is still present in this case, but G1 and G3 are both knocked out. Since G1 contributes 25% (since losing it reduces resistance to 75%) and G3 contributes 50% (losing it reduces to 50%), then losing both would leave 100 -25 -50 =25%? But the actual is 10%. So maybe their contributions are not additive but multiplicative? Let's see:\n\nIf the resistance is a product of the two, then (75%)*(50%)/100% = 37.5%, but that's not 10.",

But then the g3 mutant's resistance is 50%, which contradicts this. \n\nHmm, this suggests maybe my model is wrong. \n\nLet me try another approach. Looking at the double mutants: \n\ng1g2 has 0%, which is same as g2. That implies that the loss of G1 doesn't make it worse than g2 alone. So maybe G1 is downstream of G2, so when G2 is already knocked out, G1's presence or absence doesn't matter. \n\nSimilarly, the g2g3 double mutant is 0%, same as g2. So adding the g3 knockout doesn't make it worse. Which would imply that G3 is also downstream of G2. \n\nThe g1g3 double mutant has 10% resistance. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is present, the resistance is very low. So in that case, G2 is present, so it can still activate other genes, but since G1 and G3 are knocked out, perhaps those are the only targets? Then their absence would lead to low resistance. \n\nSo in the wild type, when G2 is active, it activates both G1 and G3, leading to full resistance. \n\nIn the g1 mutant, G3 is still active (since G2 is present), but without G1, resistance is 75%. \n\nIn the g3 mutant, G1 is still active (since G2 is present), giving 50% resistance.",

But not sure how that plays into the resistance levels.\n\nOption D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have redundancy, G1 is epistatic to G3.\n\nRedundancy would explain why their combined knockout (g1g3) is worse than either alone, but not as bad as the 0% from g2. Since the redundancy would mean that each can compensate some function. If they are redundant, their combined knockout removes both backup functions, leading to lower resistance. But G2 is a TF acting upstream. Let me see.\n\nIf G2 is a TF that controls both G1 and G3, then without G2, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed. So in g2, their absence would lead to 0%, which matches. But then, in the double mutant g1g3 (both genes knocked out), the resistance is 10%, which is better than 0. That's a problem because if G2's knockout leads to no G1 or G3, then the effect of g1g3 (both knocked out) should be the same as g2. But in reality, g1g3 has 10%, which is better than 0. Therefore, this suggests that G2's loss doesn't completely negate G1 and G3's functions. So perhaps G2 is a TF that's upstream of G1 and G3, but not the only factor?",
          "text2": "Wait, if G3 is epistatic over G1, then maybe G1's function is dependent on G3. But in the g1 mutant, resistance is still 75%, which is higher than g3's 50. That might not fit. Not sure yet.\n\nOption C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have pleiotropy (so they have multiple effects), and G1 is epistatic over G3. Epistatic here would mean that G1's presence masks G3's effect. But how does that play with the data? Let's see. If G1 is epistatic over G3, then when G1 is knocked out, maybe the effect of G3 is unmasked. But not sure.\n\nOption D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy (so they can back each other up; maybe they're in parallel pathways), and G1 is epistatic over G3. If they are redundant, then if one is knocked out, the other can compensate. So for example, the single mutants (g1 and g3) would have some resistance because the other is still present. The double mutant g1g3 would lose both, leading to lower resistance. Let's see the data. \n\nLooking at the data again, when G1 is knocked out, resistance is 75%. When G3 is knocked out, it's 50%. The double g1g3 has 10%. That suggests that together, their loss causes a much bigger problem. If they are redundant, then the single knockouts would have partial loss, but together, the combined effect is worse. So redundancy makes sense here. \n\nAlso, since G2 is a TF, maybe it's regulating both G1 and G3. Since when G2 is knocked out (as in g2, g1g2, g2g3), resistance is 0. That suggests that without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can function. So G2 is necessary for their expression or activity. \n\nNow, looking at the epistatic relationship. If G1 is epistatic over G3, that would mean that G1's function is upstream of G3, so if G1 is present, G3 can't compensate? Or maybe that G1's mutation masks the effect of G3. For example, if G1 is knocked out, then G3's effect isn't as effective.",

If G2 is epistatic over G1, then the presence of G2's mutation would mask G1's effect. So in the g1g2 double, the phenotype would be same as g2's (0%), which is indeed what's observed. But then why does the g2 single have 0%? If G2 is epistatic over G1, but G1 is a TF, then maybe G2 is acting downstream? Not sure. Also, the g3 mutant is 50%, so if G3 is also downstream of G1, then without G1, G3 can't be expressed. But then the g3 mutant would have the same as g1g3? Not sure. \n\nHmm. Let me think again. The key is that G2's knockout gives 0% resistance. So G2 is crucial. The fact that g1g2 is same as g2 suggests that G2 is epistatic over G1. So if G2 is a TF, then maybe G1 is downstream of G2? Because when you knock out G2, you lose whatever G1 was doing, so removing G1 again doesn't make a difference. So in that case, G2's mutation masks G1's mutation, so G2 is epistatic over G1.",

That's a problem because if G2's knockout leads to no G1 or G3, then the effect of g1g3 (both knocked out) should be the same as g2. But in reality, g1g3 has 10%, which is better than 0.

That suggests that without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can function. So G2 is necessary for their expression or activity. \n\nNow, looking at the epistatic relationship. If G1 is epistatic over G3, that would mean that G1's function is upstream of G3, so if G1 is present, G3 can't compensate? Or maybe that G1's mutation masks the effect of G3.

But the double is 10%, so that's not the case.\n\nOption C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic over G3. Pleiotropy is about a gene affecting multiple traits, but here we're looking at a single trait (resistance). So maybe that's not relevant. The epistasis part again, same problem as before. \n\nOption A: G1 is the TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic over G1. If G1 is a TF upstream, then its knockout would reduce resistance (75% which is less than full). But the g2 mutant has 0% resistance. If G2 is epistatic over G1, then the presence of G2's mutation would mask G1's effect. So in the g1g2 double, the phenotype would be same as g2's (0%), which is indeed what's observed. But then why does the g2 single have 0%? If G2 is epistatic over G1, but G1 is a TF, then maybe G2 is acting downstream? Not sure. Also, the g3 mutant is 50%, so if G3 is also downstream of G1, then without G1, G3 can't be expressed. But then the g3 mutant would have the same as g1g3? Not sure. \n\nHmm. Let me think again. The key is that G2's knockout gives 0% resistance. So G2 is crucial. The fact that g1g2 is same as g2 suggests that G2 is epistatic over G1. So if G2 is a TF, then maybe G1 is downstream of G2? Because when you knock out G2, you lose whatever G1 was doing, so removing G1 again doesn't make a difference. So in that case, G2's mutation masks G1's mutation, so G2 is epistatic over G1.",

Let's consider each option:\n\nOption A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic to G1.\n\nIf G1 is the TF, then the g1 mutant would have a severe effect, but in reality, g1 is 75%, which isn't as bad as g2's 0%.

Because if G2 is knocked out, then even if G1 and G3 are present, they might not be expressed? But then why does the g1g2 mutant have 0%? Because G2 is already off, so the others can't matter.

So G2 is the key here. So the TF is likely G2.\n\nNow, the other genes (G1 and G3) must be downstream of G2. So their activity depends on G2. Let's look at their single mutants. The g1 single mutant has 75% resistance. So losing G1 reduces resistance by 25%, but there's still some. The g3 single has 50%, so losing G3 cuts resistance by half. Since G2 is a TF, maybe both G1 and G3 are downstream and contribute to resistance. \n\nNow, the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. Which is way lower than the sum of their individual effects.",

So G1's function might be contributing but not essential. \n\nLooking at the double mutants:\n\n- g1g2: 0% resistance. But since g2 alone is already 0%, that's the same.

That's a problem because if G2's knockout leads to no G1 or G3, then the effect of g1g3 (both knocked out) should be the same as g2. But in reality, g1g3 has 10%, which is better than 0.

But not sure.\n\nOption D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy (so they can back each other up; maybe they're in parallel pathways), and G1 is epistatic over G3. If they are redundant, then if one is knocked out, the other can compensate. So for example, the single mutants (g1 and g3) would have some resistance because the other is still present.

If they are redundant, then the single knockouts would have partial loss, but together, the combined effect is worse. So redundancy makes sense here. \n\nAlso, since G2 is a TF, maybe it's regulating both G1 and G3. Since when G2 is knocked out (as in g2, g1g2, g2g3), resistance is 0. That suggests that without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can function. So G2 is necessary for their expression or activity. \n\nNow, looking at the epistatic relationship. If G1 is epistatic over G3, that would mean that G1's function is upstream of G3, so if G1 is present, G3 can't compensate? Or maybe that G1's mutation masks the effect of G3.

Redundancy means that they can substitute for each other. So the combined knockout would be worse than each single.

G1's knockout gives 75%, but g3 has 50% which is lower. So that would make sense. So if G3 is epistatic over G1, then the presence of G3 is required for G1 to function. So if G3 is knocked out, G1's product doesn't help, hence less resistance than G1's own knockout. But that would mean the epistasis is G3 over G1, but option D says G1 over G3, so that's conflicting. \n\nHmm. Maybe the epistasis part is a distractor. The question says \"at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s)\". The data shows that G2 is critical because without it, resistance is 0. G1 and G3 are less critical. So G2 is likely the upstream TF. \n\nThe redundancy between G1 and G3 is supported by their combined knockout being worse than either alone. So the answer must involve that. Looking at the options, D has the redundancy part. The epistasis part in the options may be tricky.",
