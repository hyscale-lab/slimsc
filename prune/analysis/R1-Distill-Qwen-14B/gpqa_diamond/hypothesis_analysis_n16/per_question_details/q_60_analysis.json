From what I remember, the distance is approximately 163,000 light-years. Let me confirm that. Oh right, the distance is about 160,000 light-years, maybe 163,000. I think that's the approximate number. Let's say roughly 163,000 light-years away. \n\nThe spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987c.

The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is one of the Milky Way's satellite galaxies. I recall that the distance to the LMC is approximately 163,000 light-years. Let me confirm that.

The astronaut's age is 22 years old, and their average lifespan is 150 solar years, so that's a hint maybe?

Let me compute (0.99999987)^2.\n\nLet me compute it as follows: (1 - delta)^2 = 1 - 2 delta + delta\u00b2, where delta =1.3e-7. Thus 1 - (v/c)^2 = 2 delta - delta\u00b2 = 2*(1.3e-7) - (1.3e-7)^2. The delta squared term is (1.69e-14), which is negligible. So it's 2.6e-7. So the square root of (1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) is sqrt(2.6e-7). Let me compute this more accurately.\n\nsqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6) * sqrt(1e-7). sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612. sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is 3.162e-4. So 1.612 * 3.162e-4 \u2248 5.099e-4. So gamma is 1 / 5.099e-4 \u2248 1961.5. \n\nSo, using gamma of ~1961.5, then 163,000 /1961.5 \u2248 let me compute that. Let me do 163000 divided by 2000 is 81.5. Since 1961.5 is 2000 minus 38.5, so the denominator is 1961.5 = 2000*(1 - 0.01925). So 1/(1961.5) \u2248 (1/2000)*(1 + 0.01925). So total is 81.5 * (1 + 0.01925) \u2248 81.5 + (81.5 *0.01925). Let's see, 81.5 *0.02 = 1.63, so subtract a bit: 1.63 - 81.5*(0.00075) \u2248 1.63 - 0.061 \u2248 1.569. So total is 81.5 +1.569 \u2248 83.07 years. \n\nHmm, so that's around 83.

The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is one of the Milky Way's satellite galaxies. I recall that the distance to the LMC is approximately 163,000 light-years. Let me confirm that. Maybe around 160,000 light-years? Hmm, I think that's correct. So the distance is roughly 163,000 light-years. Let me note that down as D \u2248 163,000 ly.\n\nThe spacecraft is moving at v = 0.99999987c. The astronaut's age is 22 years old, and their average lifespan is 150 solar years, so that's a hint maybe? But the question is about the time experienced by the astronaut, so we have to calculate the proper time from their frame of reference.\n\nIn special relativity, when moving at a high speed, the time experienced by the traveler (proper time \u03c4) is shorter than the time measured in the Earth's frame (t). The formula for proper time is \u03c4 = t * sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).",

Since 1961.5 is 2000 minus 38.5, so the denominator is 1961.5 = 2000*(1 - 0.01925). So 1/(1961.5) \u2248 (1/2000)*(1 + 0.01925). So total is 81.5 * (1 + 0.01925) \u2248 81.5 + (81.5 *0.01925).

So indeed, the square root is ~0.00051. Therefore 1 divided by that is about 1960.8. So gamma is approximately 1961. \n\nSo gamma is around 1960. That's a huge factor. \n\nNow, the proper time \u03c4 is the astronaut's time. The time measured in Earth's frame is t = distance / speed. The distance from LMC to Earth is 163,000 light-years. So in Earth's frame, the time taken is t = D / v = 163000 ly / (0.99999987c). Since the speed is in terms of c, dividing by c gives the time in years. Since v/c is ~1, this is approximately 163000 / ~1, so roughly 163,000 years. But the exact value would be a bit less, since 0.99999987 is slightly less than 1. Let me compute that exactly. \n\nLet me calculate t = 163000 / 0.99999987. Since 0.99999987 is very close to 1, the difference is 1 - 0.99999987 = 1.3e-7. Therefore, 1/0.99999987 \u2248 1 + 1.3e-7 (using the approximation 1/(1 - \u03b5) \u2248 1 + \u03b5 for small \u03b5). So t \u2248 163000 * (1 + 1.3e-7). The 1.3e-7 term is negligible for the purposes of calculating the proper time, because when multiplied by 163000, it would be 163000 * 1.3e-7 \u2248 0.021 years, so less than a month. Therefore, the Earth time is approximately 163,000 years. \n\nThe astronaut's proper time is \u03c4 = t / gamma. Since gamma is ~1960, \u03c4 \u2248 163000 / 1960 \u2248 let's compute that. Let me see:\n\n163000 divided by 1960. Let me do the division step by step.\n\n1960 * 80 = 156,800. \n\n163,000 - 156,800 = 6,200. \n\n6200 / 1960 \u2248 3.16. So total is 80 + 3.16 \u2248 83.16. \n\nSo approximately 83 years. Hmm, but the options are 72, 81, 77.",

Since 1e-3.5 is 10^(-3.5) = 10^(-3) * 10^(-0.5) \u2248 0.001 * 0.3162 \u2248 0.0003162. So 1.612 * 0.0003162 \u2248 0.00051. So sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) \u2248 0.00051. Therefore, the gamma factor is 1 / 0.00051 \u2248 approximately 1960.78. \n\nSo gamma is roughly 1960.78. \n\nNow, the time as measured in Earth's frame (t) is distance divided by speed. The distance is 163,000 light-years. So t = 163,000 / 0.99999987 \u2248 approximately 163,000 years. Because the speed is so close to c, dividing by a number just under 1 doesn't change much.
