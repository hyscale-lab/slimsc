So SMEFT is built to maintain the same symmetries as the SM, meaning it must respect CPT, but not necessarily CP.\n\nSo for the question: which symmetries must all operators respect.\n\nAs for Lorentz and Poincare: yes, because the theory is a Lorentz-invariant effective theory.\n\nCP: No, because the operators can violate CP. So option 3 is not necessarily a symmetry that must be respected.\n\nCPT: The theory as a whole must respect CPT, but what about individual operators? If the theory is CPT-invariant, then the operator's form must be such that when you apply CPT, you get a combination that's consistent. But perhaps each operator doesn't have to individually be invariant under CPT, but the entire Lagrangian must be invariant.",
          "text2": "Wait, the SM respects CP symmetry, but some extensions (like certain beyond the SM theories) might not. But in SMEFT, are all operators required to respect CP? I think no. Because in SMEFT, you can have operators that explicitly violate CP, depending on the new physics. For example, some models have operators that are CP-odd. So 3 might not be a must-respect symmetry.\n\nCPT symmetry\u2014 that's a big one. The Standard Model is CPT symmetric. I've heard that all Lorentz-invariant theories must respect CPT symmetry. Because of the way fields are treated and their antiparticles. So any operator in SMEFT, which respects Lorentz symmetry, must automatically respect CPT. So 4 is correct.\n\nSo putting it together: all operators must respect Lorentz and Poincar\u00e9 symmetries.",
