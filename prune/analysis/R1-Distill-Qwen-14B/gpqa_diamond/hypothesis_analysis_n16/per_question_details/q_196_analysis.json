Let me denote the term (k A\u00b2)/(2 m c\u00b2) as a variable to simplify. Let's say that term is alpha, so alpha = k A\u00b2/(2 m c\u00b2). So gamma is 1 + alpha.\n\nSo, 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1 + alpha.

So, gamma = 1 + (k A\u00b2)/(2 m c\u00b2). Hmm, that makes sense.\n\nGamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So, we can write 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1 + (k A\u00b2)/(2 m c\u00b2). Let me denote the term (k A\u00b2)/(2 m c\u00b2) as a variable to simplify. Let's say that term is alpha, so alpha = k A\u00b2/(2 m c\u00b2). So gamma is 1 + alpha.\n\nSo, 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1 + alpha. Let me solve for v.\n\nFirst, take reciprocal on both sides: sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/(1 + alpha).\n\nSquare both sides: 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.\n\nThen, v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2].\n\nSo, v = c * sqrt[1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ].\n\nLet me compute that expression. Let's substitute alpha back in.\n\nv = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A\u00b2)/(2 m c\u00b2))\u00b2 ).\n\nHmm, looking at the options, option D says v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + kA\u00b2/(2 mc\u00b2))\u00b2 ). So that matches.",
