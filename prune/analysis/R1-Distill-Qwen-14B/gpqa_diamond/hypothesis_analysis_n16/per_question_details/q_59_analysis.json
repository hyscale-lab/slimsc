          "text1": "Wait, actually, before mixing, the acetic acid solution is 0.1 M in 0.5 L. But when mixed with other solutions, the total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L. So the concentration of acetic acid in the mixture would be (0.05 moles) / 1.2 L \u2248 ~0.0417 M. Then, the H+ from acetic acid would be sqrt(0.0417 * 1.8e-5) \u2248 sqrt(7.5e-7) \u2248 ~0.000866 M? Which would give a very small contribution. So in terms of moles, that's 0.000866 M * 1.2 L \u2248 ~0.001 moles. That's way smaller than the 0.08 moles from HCl. So the H+ from acetic acid is negligible here. So I can safely ignore it. So total H+ from acids is ~0.08 moles (from HCl).\n\nThe OH- from the base is 0.18 moles. Now, the reaction between H+ and OH-:\n\nTotal H+ is 0.08, OH- is 0.18. So the OH- is in excess. The moles of OH- remaining after reaction would be 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles. Because H+ will neutralize some of the OH-.",
          "text2": "Wait, but wait, actually, it's the other way around. Let me think again. The H+ (0.08) will neutralize an equal amount of OH- (0.08), so the remaining OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles. So the excess OH- is 0.1 moles.\n\nNow, considering that the acetic acid is also present. The acetic acid is a weak acid. Its H+ might contribute, but since it's a weak acid, it won't dissociate completely. However, in the presence of excess OH- (from the base), the acetic acid might not contribute because the OH- would deprotonate it further? Or does the OH- neutralize the H+ from acetic acid?\n\nHmm, since the solution has excess OH-, the acetic acid would be in a basic environment, so maybe the acetic acid will not contribute much H+ because the OH- would protonate it? Let me think. The acetic acid (CH3COOH) has a pKa around 4.76. Since the solution is basic (because excess OH- is present), the acetic acid would be mostly deprotonated (CH3COO-), so its contribution to H+ is negligible. Therefore, the main thing here is the excess OH- from the base minus the H+ from HCl and the acetic acid. But since the excess OH- is 0.1 moles, and the acetic acid's H+ is negligible compared to that, maybe we can ignore it for the pH calculation?\n\nTherefore, the total remaining OH- is 0.1 moles. Now, the total volume of the solution is the sum of the volumes: 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L.\n\nSo concentration of OH- is moles/volume: 0.1 / 1.2 \u2248 0.0833 M.\n\nThen, pOH = -log[OH-] = -log(0.0833). Let me calculate that. \n\nThe log of 0.0833 is log(8.33 x 10^-2) \u2248 log(8.33) + log(10^-2). Log(8.33) is about 0.92, so 0.92 -2 = -1.08. So -log(0.0833) would be 1.08?",

However, since we have excess OH-, which is a strong base, maybe the OH- will react with the acetic acid? Let me think. The OH- will react with the H+ from acetic acid. \n\nThe acetic acid can donate H+ according to the equation: CH3COOH \u21cc H+ + CH3COO-. The presence of OH- will take H+ ions. Each mole of OH- can take a H+ from the acetic acid. \n\nSo, the OH- that's left after neutralizing the HCl (0.1 moles) will react with the acetic acid. Let me see. The moles of acetic acid are 0.05. Let me see how much OH- can react with it. \n\nThe reaction would be: OH- + CH3COOH \u2192 CH3COO- + H2O. \n\nSo, each mole of OH- can deprotonate a mole of acetic acid. \n\nBut how much OH- is left? After HCl and Ba(OH)2: the OH- from Ba(OH)2 was 0.18, H+ from HCl was 0.08. So net OH- is 0.10. So the OH- will react with the acetic acid. \n\nSo, the OH- will take H+ from acetic acid.

The H+ from HCl (0.08 moles) and OH- from Ba(OH)2 (0.18 moles). The OH- is in excess by 0.1 moles. So after neutralizing the HCl, there's 0.1 moles of OH- left. \n\nThen, the acetic acid (CH3COOH) is a weak acid. The OH- can react with it. The acetic acid can donate a proton (since it's an acid), but in basic conditions (excess OH-), it would deprotonate to form CH3COO- and water. The reaction would be CH3COOH + OH- \u2192 CH3COO- + H2O. So each mole of OH- can neutralize a mole of CH3COOH.\n\nNow, let's compute how much acetic acid is present. The acetic acid solution is 500 mL (0.5 L) of 0.1 M. So moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.\n\nThe excess OH- from the previous step is 0.1 moles. Now, the OH- will react with the acetic acid. The OH- can neutralize the acetic acid. The OH- is 0.1 moles, and acetic acid is 0.05 moles. Since OH- is in excess here (0.1 vs 0.05), all the acetic acid will be neutralized, and there will still be leftover OH-.\n\nSo after reacting with acetic acid, the remaining OH- is 0.1 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.\n\nSo now, the total remaining OH- is 0.05 moles, and there's also the conjugate base from acetic acid (CH3COO-) which is 0.05 moles (since all the acetic acid was converted to acetate ion).",

OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles. The reaction between them:\n\nH+ + OH- \u2192 H2O. The moles of H+ are less than OH-, so all H+ is neutralized, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles OH- left.\n\nNow, the remaining OH- (0.10) will react with the acetic acid. The acetic acid can donate H+ in the reaction with OH-:\n\nCH3COOH + OH- \u2192 CH3COO- + H2O.\n\nThe moles of acetic acid are 0.05. The OH- available is 0.10. So the OH- can neutralize all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, using 0.05 moles of OH-, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- remaining. \n\nThus, total OH- in solution after all reactions is 0.05 moles. \n\nTotal volume: 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L. \n\n[OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666...

Each mole of acetic acid can react with 1 mole OH- to form acetate and water.

So the excess OH- is 0.1 moles.\n\nNow, considering that the acetic acid is also present. The acetic acid is a weak acid. Its H+ might contribute, but since it's a weak acid, it won't dissociate completely. However, in the presence of excess OH- (from the base), the acetic acid might not contribute because the OH- would deprotonate it further? Or does the OH- neutralize the H+ from acetic acid?\n\nHmm, since the solution has excess OH-, the acetic acid would be in a basic environment, so maybe the acetic acid will not contribute much H+ because the OH- would protonate it? Let me think. The acetic acid (CH3COOH) has a pKa around 4.76. Since the solution is basic (because excess OH- is present), the acetic acid would be mostly deprotonated (CH3COO-), so its contribution to H+ is negligible. Therefore, the main thing here is the excess OH- from the base minus the H+ from HCl and the acetic acid. But since the excess OH- is 0.1 moles, and the acetic acid's H+ is negligible compared to that, maybe we can ignore it for the pH calculation?\n\nTherefore, the total remaining OH- is 0.1 moles. Now, the total volume of the solution is the sum of the volumes: 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L.\n\nSo concentration of OH- is moles/volume: 0.1 / 1.2 \u2248 0.0833 M.\n\nThen, pOH = -log[OH-] = -log(0.0833).

          "text1": "Wait, actually, before mixing, the acetic acid solution is 0.1 M in 0.5 L. But when mixed with other solutions, the total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L. So the concentration of acetic acid in the mixture would be (0.05 moles) / 1.2 L \u2248 ~0.0417 M. Then, the H+ from acetic acid would be sqrt(0.0417 * 1.8e-5) \u2248 sqrt(7.5e-7) \u2248 ~0.000866 M? Which would give a very small contribution. So in terms of moles, that's 0.000866 M * 1.2 L \u2248 ~0.001 moles. That's way smaller than the 0.08 moles from HCl. So the H+ from acetic acid is negligible here. So I can safely ignore it. So total H+ from acids is ~0.08 moles (from HCl).\n\nThe OH- from the base is 0.18 moles. Now, the reaction between H+ and OH-:\n\nTotal H+ is 0.08, OH- is 0.18. So the OH- is in excess. The moles of OH- remaining after reaction would be 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles. Because H+ will neutralize some of the OH-.",
          "text2": "Wait, but wait, actually, it's the other way around. Let me think again. The H+ (0.08) will neutralize an equal amount of OH- (0.08), so the remaining OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles. So the excess OH- is 0.1 moles.\n\nNow, considering that the acetic acid is also present. The acetic acid is a weak acid. Its H+ might contribute, but since it's a weak acid, it won't dissociate completely. However, in the presence of excess OH- (from the base), the acetic acid might not contribute because the OH- would deprotonate it further? Or does the OH- neutralize the H+ from acetic acid?\n\nHmm, since the solution has excess OH-, the acetic acid would be in a basic environment, so maybe the acetic acid will not contribute much H+ because the OH- would protonate it? Let me think. The acetic acid (CH3COOH) has a pKa around 4.76. Since the solution is basic (because excess OH- is present), the acetic acid would be mostly deprotonated (CH3COO-), so its contribution to H+ is negligible. Therefore, the main thing here is the excess OH- from the base minus the H+ from HCl and the acetic acid. But since the excess OH- is 0.1 moles, and the acetic acid's H+ is negligible compared to that, maybe we can ignore it for the pH calculation?\n\nTherefore, the total remaining OH- is 0.1 moles. Now, the total volume of the solution is the sum of the volumes: 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L.\n\nSo concentration of OH- is moles/volume: 0.1 / 1.2 \u2248 0.0833 M.\n\nThen, pOH = -log[OH-] = -log(0.0833). Let me calculate that. \n\nThe log of 0.0833 is log(8.33 x 10^-2) \u2248 log(8.33) + log(10^-2). Log(8.33) is about 0.92, so 0.92 -2 = -1.08. So -log(0.0833) would be 1.08?",

Since 0.05 moles of acetic acid, that uses up 0.05 moles of OH-, leaving 0.10 -0.05=0.05 moles OH-.\n\nSo yes, so the remaining OH- is 0.05 moles. \n\nThen the total OH- concentration is 0.05 / 1.2 L. Let me compute that:\n\n0.05 divided by 1.2 is approximately 0.041666...

The total volume is 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.\n\nThe remaining OH- is 0.05 moles. \n\nSo [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 = approximately 0.041666... M. \n\nThen, pOH = -log10(0.041666).

OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles. The reaction between them:\n\nH+ + OH- \u2192 H2O. The moles of H+ are less than OH-, so all H+ is neutralized, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles OH- left.\n\nNow, the remaining OH- (0.10) will react with the acetic acid.

So the excess OH- is 0.1 moles.\n\nNow, considering that the acetic acid is also present. The acetic acid is a weak acid. Its H+ might contribute, but since it's a weak acid, it won't dissociate completely. However, in the presence of excess OH- (from the base), the acetic acid might not contribute because the OH- would deprotonate it further? Or does the OH- neutralize the H+ from acetic acid?\n\nHmm, since the solution has excess OH-, the acetic acid would be in a basic environment, so maybe the acetic acid will not contribute much H+ because the OH- would protonate it? Let me think. The acetic acid (CH3COOH) has a pKa around 4.76. Since the solution is basic (because excess OH- is present), the acetic acid would be mostly deprotonated (CH3COO-), so its contribution to H+ is negligible. Therefore, the main thing here is the excess OH- from the base minus the H+ from HCl and the acetic acid.

Each mole of OH- can neutralize a mole of acetic acid (HA \u2192 A^- + H2O).\n\nSo the acetic acid is 0.05 mol. The OH- here is 0.10 mol. So:\n\nThe OH- will neutralize all 0.05 mol of acetic acid, using up 0.05 mol of OH-, leaving 0.05 mol OH- remaining. \n\nSo after this step:\n\nRemaining OH- = 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol\n\nAcetic acid is now 0 mol, converted to 0.05 mol of acetate ion (A^-). \n\nAdditionally, the acetate ion is a weak base, but in solution with excess OH-, its contribution to pH might be negligible compared to the OH-.\n\nTherefore, the main contributor to the pH is the excess OH- concentration. \n\nTotal volume is 1200 mL = 1.2 L. \n\nSo [OH-] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04166... M.\n\npOH = -log10(0.04166) \n\nCalculating that:\n\nlog(0.04166). Let's see. Log(4.166e-2) = log(4.166) + log(10^-2) \u2248 0.6198 - 2 = -1.3802.",

So the concentration of acetic acid in the mixture would be (0.05 moles) / 1.2 L \u2248 ~0.0417 M. Then, the H+ from acetic acid would be sqrt(0.0417 * 1.8e-5) \u2248 sqrt(7.5e-7) \u2248 ~0.000866 M? Which would give a very small contribution. So in terms of moles, that's 0.000866 M * 1.2 L \u2248 ~0.001 moles. That's way smaller than the 0.08 moles from HCl. So the H+ from acetic acid is negligible here. So I can safely ignore it. So total H+ from acids is ~0.08 moles (from HCl).\n\nThe OH- from the base is 0.18 moles. Now, the reaction between H+ and OH-:\n\nTotal H+ is 0.08, OH- is 0.18. So the OH- is in excess. The moles of OH- remaining after reaction would be 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

          "text2": "Wait, but wait, actually, it's the other way around. Let me think again. The H+ (0.08) will neutralize an equal amount of OH- (0.08), so the remaining OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles. So the excess OH- is 0.1 moles.\n\nNow, considering that the acetic acid is also present. The acetic acid is a weak acid. Its H+ might contribute, but since it's a weak acid, it won't dissociate completely. However, in the presence of excess OH- (from the base), the acetic acid might not contribute because the OH- would deprotonate it further? Or does the OH- neutralize the H+ from acetic acid?\n\nHmm, since the solution has excess OH-, the acetic acid would be in a basic environment, so maybe the acetic acid will not contribute much H+ because the OH- would protonate it? Let me think. The acetic acid (CH3COOH) has a pKa around 4.76. Since the solution is basic (because excess OH- is present), the acetic acid would be mostly deprotonated (CH3COO-), so its contribution to H+ is negligible. Therefore, the main thing here is the excess OH- from the base minus the H+ from HCl and the acetic acid. But since the excess OH- is 0.1 moles, and the acetic acid's H+ is negligible compared to that, maybe we can ignore it for the pH calculation?\n\nTherefore, the total remaining OH- is 0.1 moles. Now, the total volume of the solution is the sum of the volumes: 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L.\n\nSo concentration of OH- is moles/volume: 0.1 / 1.2 \u2248 0.0833 M.\n\nThen, pOH = -log[OH-] = -log(0.0833).

OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles. The reaction between them:\n\nH+ + OH- \u2192 H2O. The moles of H+ are less than OH-, so all H+ is neutralized, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles OH- left.\n\nNow, the remaining OH- (0.10) will react with the acetic acid.

So the excess OH- is 0.1 moles.\n\nNow, considering that the acetic acid is also present. The acetic acid is a weak acid. Its H+ might contribute, but since it's a weak acid, it won't dissociate completely. However, in the presence of excess OH- (from the base), the acetic acid might not contribute because the OH- would deprotonate it further? Or does the OH- neutralize the H+ from acetic acid?\n\nHmm, since the solution has excess OH-, the acetic acid would be in a basic environment, so maybe the acetic acid will not contribute much H+ because the OH- would protonate it? Let me think. The acetic acid (CH3COOH) has a pKa around 4.76. Since the solution is basic (because excess OH- is present), the acetic acid would be mostly deprotonated (CH3COO-), so its contribution to H+ is negligible. Therefore, the main thing here is the excess OH- from the base minus the H+ from HCl and the acetic acid. But since the excess OH- is 0.1 moles, and the acetic acid's H+ is negligible compared to that, maybe we can ignore it for the pH calculation?\n\nTherefore, the total remaining OH- is 0.1 moles.

Let's compute that:\n\nH+ available: 0.08 mol\n\nOH- available: 0.18 mol\n\nThe H+ and OH- neutralize each other in a 1:1 ratio. The excess OH- is (0.18 - 0.08) = 0.10 mol.\n\nNow, the excess OH- will react with the acetic acid. Each mole of OH- can neutralize a mole of acetic acid (HA \u2192 A^- + H2O).\n\nSo the acetic acid is 0.05 mol. The OH- here is 0.10 mol. So:\n\nThe OH- will neutralize all 0.05 mol of acetic acid, using up 0.05 mol of OH-, leaving 0.05 mol OH- remaining. \n\nSo after this step:\n\nRemaining OH- = 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol\n\nAcetic acid is now 0 mol, converted to 0.05 mol of acetate ion (A^-). \n\nAdditionally, the acetate ion is a weak base, but in solution with excess OH-, its contribution to pH might be negligible compared to the OH-.\n\nTherefore, the main contributor to the pH is the excess OH- concentration. \n\nTotal volume is 1200 mL = 1.2 L. \n\nSo [OH-] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04166...

So the concentration of acetic acid in the mixture would be (0.05 moles) / 1.2 L \u2248 ~0.0417 M. Then, the H+ from acetic acid would be sqrt(0.0417 * 1.8e-5) \u2248 sqrt(7.5e-7) \u2248 ~0.000866 M?

          "text2": "Wait, but wait, actually, it's the other way around. Let me think again. The H+ (0.08) will neutralize an equal amount of OH- (0.08), so the remaining OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles. So the excess OH- is 0.1 moles.\n\nNow, considering that the acetic acid is also present. The acetic acid is a weak acid. Its H+ might contribute, but since it's a weak acid, it won't dissociate completely. However, in the presence of excess OH- (from the base), the acetic acid might not contribute because the OH- would deprotonate it further? Or does the OH- neutralize the H+ from acetic acid?\n\nHmm, since the solution has excess OH-, the acetic acid would be in a basic environment, so maybe the acetic acid will not contribute much H+ because the OH- would protonate it? Let me think. The acetic acid (CH3COOH) has a pKa around 4.76. Since the solution is basic (because excess OH- is present), the acetic acid would be mostly deprotonated (CH3COO-), so its contribution to H+ is negligible. Therefore, the main thing here is the excess OH- from the base minus the H+ from HCl and the acetic acid. But since the excess OH- is 0.1 moles, and the acetic acid's H+ is negligible compared to that, maybe we can ignore it for the pH calculation?\n\nTherefore, the total remaining OH- is 0.1 moles. Now, the total volume of the solution is the sum of the volumes: 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L.\n\nSo concentration of OH- is moles/volume: 0.1 / 1.2 \u2248 0.0833 M.\n\nThen, pOH = -log[OH-] = -log(0.0833).

OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles. The reaction between them:\n\nH+ + OH- \u2192 H2O. The moles of H+ are less than OH-, so all H+ is neutralized, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles OH- left.\n\nNow, the remaining OH- (0.10) will react with the acetic acid.

So the excess OH- is 0.1 moles.\n\nNow, considering that the acetic acid is also present. The acetic acid is a weak acid. Its H+ might contribute, but since it's a weak acid, it won't dissociate completely. However, in the presence of excess OH- (from the base), the acetic acid might not contribute because the OH- would deprotonate it further? Or does the OH- neutralize the H+ from acetic acid?\n\nHmm, since the solution has excess OH-, the acetic acid would be in a basic environment, so maybe the acetic acid will not contribute much H+ because the OH- would protonate it? Let me think. The acetic acid (CH3COOH) has a pKa around 4.76. Since the solution is basic (because excess OH- is present), the acetic acid would be mostly deprotonated (CH3COO-), so its contribution to H+ is negligible. Therefore, the main thing here is the excess OH- from the base minus the H+ from HCl and the acetic acid.

Each mole of OH- can neutralize a mole of acetic acid (HA \u2192 A^- + H2O).\n\nSo the acetic acid is 0.05 mol. The OH- here is 0.10 mol. So:\n\nThe OH- will neutralize all 0.05 mol of acetic acid, using up 0.05 mol of OH-, leaving 0.05 mol OH- remaining. \n\nSo after this step:\n\nRemaining OH- = 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol\n\nAcetic acid is now 0 mol, converted to 0.05 mol of acetate ion (A^-). \n\nAdditionally, the acetate ion is a weak base, but in solution with excess OH-, its contribution to pH might be negligible compared to the OH-.\n\nTherefore, the main contributor to the pH is the excess OH- concentration. \n\nTotal volume is 1200 mL = 1.2 L. \n\nSo [OH-] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04166... M.\n\npOH = -log10(0.04166) \n\nCalculating that:\n\nlog(0.04166). Let's see. Log(4.166e-2) = log(4.166) + log(10^-2) \u2248 0.6198 - 2 = -1.3802.",

          "text1": "Wait, actually, before mixing, the acetic acid solution is 0.1 M in 0.5 L. But when mixed with other solutions, the total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L. So the concentration of acetic acid in the mixture would be (0.05 moles) / 1.2 L \u2248 ~0.0417 M. Then, the H+ from acetic acid would be sqrt(0.0417 * 1.8e-5) \u2248 sqrt(7.5e-7) \u2248 ~0.000866 M? Which would give a very small contribution. So in terms of moles, that's 0.000866 M * 1.2 L \u2248 ~0.001 moles. That's way smaller than the 0.08 moles from HCl. So the H+ from acetic acid is negligible here. So I can safely ignore it. So total H+ from acids is ~0.08 moles (from HCl).\n\nThe OH- from the base is 0.18 moles. Now, the reaction between H+ and OH-:\n\nTotal H+ is 0.08, OH- is 0.18. So the OH- is in excess. The moles of OH- remaining after reaction would be 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles. Because H+ will neutralize some of the OH-.",
          "text2": "Wait, but wait, actually, it's the other way around. Let me think again. The H+ (0.08) will neutralize an equal amount of OH- (0.08), so the remaining OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles. So the excess OH- is 0.1 moles.\n\nNow, considering that the acetic acid is also present. The acetic acid is a weak acid. Its H+ might contribute, but since it's a weak acid, it won't dissociate completely. However, in the presence of excess OH- (from the base), the acetic acid might not contribute because the OH- would deprotonate it further? Or does the OH- neutralize the H+ from acetic acid?\n\nHmm, since the solution has excess OH-, the acetic acid would be in a basic environment, so maybe the acetic acid will not contribute much H+ because the OH- would protonate it? Let me think. The acetic acid (CH3COOH) has a pKa around 4.76. Since the solution is basic (because excess OH- is present), the acetic acid would be mostly deprotonated (CH3COO-), so its contribution to H+ is negligible. Therefore, the main thing here is the excess OH- from the base minus the H+ from HCl and the acetic acid. But since the excess OH- is 0.1 moles, and the acetic acid's H+ is negligible compared to that, maybe we can ignore it for the pH calculation?\n\nTherefore, the total remaining OH- is 0.1 moles. Now, the total volume of the solution is the sum of the volumes: 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L.\n\nSo concentration of OH- is moles/volume: 0.1 / 1.2 \u2248 0.0833 M.\n\nThen, pOH = -log[OH-] = -log(0.0833). Let me calculate that. \n\nThe log of 0.0833 is log(8.33 x 10^-2) \u2248 log(8.33) + log(10^-2). Log(8.33) is about 0.92, so 0.92 -2 = -1.08. So -log(0.0833) would be 1.08?",

M \n\npOH = -log(0.041666) \u2248 1.38 \n\nSo pH = 14-1.38 = 12.62, so answer A. \n\nHmm, that seems right. The options include A as 12.62, so I think that's correct.",

Each has 2 OH-, so 0.18 mol OH-.\n\nH+ + OH- \u2192 H2O. The H+ is 0.08, so subtract from OH-: 0.18 -0.08 =0.10 mol OH- remaining.\n\nThen, acetic acid (0.05 mol) reacts with OH- (0.10 mol). The OH- will take H+ from acetic acid. Each mole of acetic acid can neutralize 1 mole OH-. So 0.05 mol OH- will be used, leaving 0.05 mol OH-.\n\nTotal OH- after reaction:0.05 mol.

Since acetic acid is a weak acid, but in solution with a strong base's hydroxide, maybe it's better to first compute the excess OH- and then see if the acetic acid contributes anything.
