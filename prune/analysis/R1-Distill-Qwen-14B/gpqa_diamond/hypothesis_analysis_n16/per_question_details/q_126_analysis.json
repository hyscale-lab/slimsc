Since NaBH4 is a stereoselective reagent, it typically reduces ketones to the less hindered side, but in this case, the ketones are symmetrical. Let's see the structure of pentane-2,4-dione. Each ketone (at C2 and C4) is in a symmetrical environment. For the ketone at C2, the two adjacent carbons are CH3 and CH2. The ketone at C4 is similar (CH2 and CH3).
