The operator P is given as a vector, and the components are given as matrices. So let's compute P for a general direction n in the x-z plane.\n\nSince n is in x-z plane, ny = 0, so P = nx Px + 0 * Py + nz Pz.\n\nSo substituting the matrices:\n\nPx is (\u0127/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]\nPz is (\u0127/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nSo P = nx (\u0127/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz (\u0127/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nLet me factor out \u0127/2:\n\nP = (\u0127/2) [ nx [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]\n\nLet me compute the matrix inside the brackets:\n\nThe first term is nx * [[0,1],[1,0]], so it becomes:\n\n0  nx\nnx  0\n\nThe second term is nz * [[1,0],[0,-1]], so it becomes:\n\nnz  0\n0  -nz\n\nAdding them together, the matrix becomes:\n\n[nz, nx]\n[nx, -nz]\n\nSo the full P matrix is (\u0127/2) times that. So:\n\nP = (\u0127/2) * [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ]\n\nSo now, the eigenvalue equation is:\n\nP |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n[ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ] * |\u03c8> = |\u03c8>\n\nBecause when you factor out (\u0127/2), both sides divide by it, so the equation becomes:\n\n[ nz  nx ] [a]   [a]\n[ nx -nz ] [b] = [b]\n\nSo the matrix equation is:\n\n[nz a + nx b] = a\n[nx a - nz b] = b\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1) nz a + nx b = a\n2) nx a - nz b = b\n\nLet me rearrange equation 1:\n\nnz a + nx b = a \u2192 nz a = a - nx b \u2192 a (nz - 1) + nx b = 0\nSimilarly, equation 2:\n\nnx a - nz b = b \u2192 nx a = (nz + 1) b \u2192 a = [(nz + 1)/nx ] b",

Let's set v2 =1, then express v1 in terms of v2.\n\nFrom equation 1: v1 = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] *1.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to parameterize in terms of angles. Since n is in the x-z plane, n is (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, 0, cos\u03b8). But earlier, we determined that \u03c6 is 0 or \u03c0. Let me assume \u03c6=0 for simplicity, so n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8.\n\nSo substituting n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8.\n\nSo the matrix becomes [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]].\n\nThe eigenvector equation for eigenvalue +1:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8],\n  [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] [v1; v2] = [v1; v2].\n\nSo the equations:\n\ncos\u03b8 v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = v1 \u2192 (cos\u03b8 -1 ) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 =0,\n\nsin\u03b8 v1 - cos\u03b8 v2 = v2 \u2192 sin\u03b8 v1 + (-cos\u03b8 -1 ) v2 =0.\n\nLet me write equation 1:\n\n( cos\u03b8 -1 ) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 =0.\n\nLet me solve for v2 in terms of v1.\n\nv2 = [ (1 - cos\u03b8) / sin\u03b8 ] v1.\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2:\n\nsin\u03b8 v1 + (-cos\u03b8 -1) v2 =0 \u2192 v2 = [ sin\u03b8 / (cos\u03b8 +1) ] v1.\n\nSo for v2, both expressions must be equal:\n\n(1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = sin\u03b8/(cos\u03b8 +1).\n\nLet me check this:\n\n(1 - cos\u03b8) (cos\u03b8 +1) = (1 - cos\u00b2\u03b8) = sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo numerator on left is (1 - cos\u03b8)(1 + cos\u03b8) = sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nDenominator on left is sin\u03b8.\n\nSo left side is sin\u00b2\u03b8 / sin\u03b8 = sin\u03b8.\n\nRight side is sin\u03b8 / (1 + cos\u03b8) * (1 + cos\u03b8) \u2192 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo both expressions give the same v2 in terms of v1, which is consistent.\n\nSo let's pick v1 as a parameter. Let\u2019s say v1 = A, then v2 = [ (1 - cos\u03b8) / sin\u03b8 ] A.",

So this condition is satisfied, which indicates that the equations are consistent and there's a non-trivial solution. So the eigenvectors exist.\n\nNow, let's find the eigenvector.

So, the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (+\u0127/2) |v>.\n\nWhich means (P - (+\u0127/2) I) |v> = 0.\n\nLet me write the matrix (P - (\u0127/2) I):\n\nTop-left: (\u0127/2 cos\u03b8) - (\u0127/2) = (\u0127/2)(cos\u03b8 -1)\nTop-right: (\u0127/2 sin\u03b8)\nBottom-left: (\u0127/2 sin\u03b8)\nBottom-right: (-\u0127/2 cos\u03b8) - (\u0127/2) = (-\u0127/2)(cos\u03b8 +1 )\n\nSo the matrix is:\n\n[ (\u0127/2)(cos\u03b8 -1), (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8 ]\n[ (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8, (-\u0127/2)(cos\u03b8 +1 ) ]\n\nWe can factor out (\u0127/2) from each element to simplify:\n\n(\u0127/2) * [ (cos\u03b8 -1), sin\u03b8 ]\n          [ sin\u03b8, -(cos\u03b8 +1) ]\n\nSo the matrix equation becomes (after factoring out \u0127/2, which is a scalar and can be ignored for the purposes of solving the homogeneous equations):\n\n[ (cos\u03b8 -1)   sin\u03b8     ] [a]   [0]\n[   sin\u03b8      -(cos\u03b8 +1) ] [b] = [0]\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\n1. (cos\u03b8 -1) a + sin\u03b8 b = 0\n2. sin\u03b8 a - (cos\u03b8 +1) b = 0\n\nLet me write equation 1 as:\n\n(cos\u03b8 -1) a = -sin\u03b8 b\n=> a = [ -sin\u03b8 / (cos\u03b8 -1) ) ] b\nBut cos\u03b8 -1 is -(1 - cos\u03b8), so this becomes a = [ sin\u03b8 / (1 - cos\u03b8) ) ] b\n\nI can simplify sin\u03b8/(1 - cos\u03b8). Remember that 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2). So,\n\nsin\u03b8/(1 - cos\u03b8) = [2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)] / [2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) ] = [ cos(\u03b8/2) ] / [ sin(\u03b8/2) ) ] = cot(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo a = cot(\u03b8/2) * b",
