So n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8. \n\nSo, P_n = (P_x * sin\u03b8 + P_z * cos\u03b8). Since each component is (\u0127/2) times their respective Pauli matrices, substituting in:\n\nP_n = (\u0127/2)[ \u03c3_x sin\u03b8 + \u03c3_z cos\u03b8 ].\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Let me write out the matrix for P_n first. Let's compute the matrix:\n\n\u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So:\n\n\u03c3_x sin\u03b8 + \u03c3_z cos\u03b8 = \n[0*sin\u03b8 + 1*cos\u03b8 , 1*sin\u03b8 + 0*cos\u03b8]\n[1*sin\u03b8 + 0*cos\u03b8 , 0*sin\u03b8 + (-1)*cos\u03b8]\n\nBreaking that down:\n\nFirst row first element: cos\u03b8\nFirst row second element: sin\u03b8\nSecond row first element: sin\u03b8\nSecond row second element: -cos\u03b8\n\nTherefore, the matrix for (\u03c3_x sin\u03b8 + \u03c3_z cos\u03b8) is:\n\n[ cos\u03b8    sin\u03b8 ]\n[ sin\u03b8  -cos\u03b8 ]\n\nMultiply by \u0127/2, but since we are looking for the eigenvector, the scaling factor (\u0127/2) doesn't affect the eigenvector's direction, just the eigenvalue. The eigenvalues of the operator P_n will be \u00b1\u0127/2. So, we can set up the equation (\u03c3_x sin\u03b8 + \u03c3_z cos\u03b8) |v> = (1) |v>, since the eigenvalue is +1 (since the eigenvalue of P_n is \u0127/2, so the operator (\u03c3 ... ) has eigenvalues 1 and -1 when multiplied by \u0127/2).\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n[ cos\u03b8    sin\u03b8 ] [v1]   = 1*[v1]\n[ sin\u03b8  -cos\u03b8 ] [v2]       [v2]\n\nSo the equations are:\n\ncos\u03b8 * v1 + sin\u03b8 * v2 = v1\n\nsin\u03b8 * v1 - cos\u03b8 * v2 = v2\n\nLet me rearrange the first equation:\n\ncos\u03b8 v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = v1 \u2192 (cos\u03b8 -1)v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0\n\nSecond equation:\n\nsin\u03b8 v1 - cos\u03b8 v2 = v2 \u2192 sin\u03b8 v1 - (cos\u03b8 +1) v2 = 0\n\nSo now we have a system of equations:\n\n( cos\u03b8 -1 ) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0\n\nsin\u03b8 v1 - (cos\u03b8 +1 ) v2 = 0\n\nThese two equations must be consistent. Let me see if they are multiples of each other. Let's see: Let's take the first equation and see if the second can be written as a multiple.\n\nSuppose I multiply the first equation by some factor k to get the second equation.\n\nSo:\n\nk*(cos\u03b8 -1) = sin\u03b8 (coefficient of v1)\n\nand\n\nk*sin\u03b8 = - (cos\u03b8 +1) (coefficient of v2)\n\nSo, from first part: k = sin\u03b8 / (cos\u03b8 -1)\n\nFrom second part: k = [ - (cos\u03b8 +1) ] / sin\u03b8\n\nSet equal:\n\nsin\u03b8/(cos\u03b8 -1) = [ - (cos\u03b8 +1) ] / sin\u03b8\n\nCross-multiplying: sin\u00b2\u03b8 = - (cos\u03b8 +1)(cos\u03b8 -1)\n\nRight-hand side: - (cos\u00b2\u03b8 -1) = -cos\u00b2\u03b8 +1 = 1 - cos\u00b2\u03b8 = sin\u00b2\u03b8. So yes, that's equal. So the two equations are indeed multiples, so the system is consistent.\n\nTherefore, to find the eigenvectors, we can take any one equation. Let's take the first equation:\n\n( cos\u03b8 -1 ) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 = [ (1 - cos\u03b8)/ sin\u03b8 ] v1\n\nHmm, let me compute (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8. Let's recall that (1 - cos\u03b8) = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2). So:\n\n(1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = [2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)] / [2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)] ) = tan(\u03b8/2)\n\nTherefore, v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) v1.",

Since cos\u03b8 -1 = -2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2). \n\nSo substituting:\n\n- sin\u03b8 / (cos\u03b8 -1) = - [ 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2) ] / [ -2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) ] \n\nThe negatives cancel, denominator is - (2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)), so overall:\n\n= [2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2) ] / [ 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) ] \n\n= [ cos(\u03b8/2) / sin(\u03b8/2) ) ] \n\n= cot(\u03b8/2 )\n\nTherefore, a = cot(\u03b8/2) * b \n\nSo we can set b =1 (since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar), then a = cot(\u03b8/2). \n\nThus, the eigenvector is [cot(\u03b8/2), 1]^T.

          "text1": "Wait, actually, let me clarify:\n\nThe components P_x, P_y, P_z are each equal to (\u0127/2) multiplied by their respective Pauli matrices. So when we take the vector operator P, its components are already scaled by \u0127/2. Therefore, the operator in the direction n is P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since each term is already (\u0127/2) times the Pauli matrix, the entire operator P_n will be (\u0127/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) because n_y is zero. \n\nTherefore, the operator matrix for P_n is (\u0127/2) times [ n_x * \u03c3_x + n_z * \u03c3_z ].\n\nSo let's compute that matrix. Let me write out \u03c3_x and \u03c3_z:\n\n\u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. \n\nSo n_x is sin\u03b8, n_z is cos\u03b8. \n\nPutting it together:\n\nn_x \u03c3_x = sin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[1,0]]\n\nn_z \u03c3_z = cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nAdding them together:\n\nThe top-left element is 0*sin\u03b8 + cos\u03b8*1 = cos\u03b8\n\nThe top-right element is 1*sin\u03b8 + 0*cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8\n\nSimilarly, bottom-left is sin\u03b8 (from \u03c3_x term) and bottom-right is -cos\u03b8 (from \u03c3_z term)\n\nTherefore, the sum n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z is:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8],\n  [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ]\n\nTherefore, P_n = (\u0127/2) times this matrix.\n\nNow, the eigenvalue equation is P_n |v\u27e9 = (+\u0127/2)|v\u27e9.\n\nLet me write the eigenvalue equation:\n\n( (\u0127/2) [ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] ) * |v\u27e9 = (\u0127/2)|v\u27e9 \n\nMultiply both sides by 2/\u0127 to simplify:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] * |v\u27e9 = |v\u27e9 \n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] * [v1; v2] = [v1; v2]\n\nSo let's write this as a matrix equation:\n\ncos\u03b8 * v1 + sin\u03b8 * v2 = v1 \n\nsin\u03b8 * v1 - cos\u03b8 * v2 = v2 \n\nLet me rearrange the equations:\n\nFirst equation:\n\ncos\u03b8 v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = v1 \n\n=> (cos\u03b8 - 1) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0 \n\nSecond equation:\n\nsin\u03b8 v1 - cos\u03b8 v2 = v2 \n\n=> sin\u03b8 v1 - (cos\u03b8 + 1) v2 = 0 \n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1) (cos\u03b8 - 1)v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0 \n\n2) sin\u03b8 v1 - (cos\u03b8 + 1) v2 = 0 \n\nThese two equations must be satisfied simultaneously. Let's try to solve them. \n\nLet me express equation 1 as:\n\nsin\u03b8 v2 = (1 - cos\u03b8) v1 \n\nSo v2 = ( (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ) v1 \n\nSimilarly, equation 2: \n\nsin\u03b8 v1 = (cos\u03b8 +1 ) v2 \n\nSubstituting v2 from equation 1 into equation 2: \n\nsin\u03b8 v1 = (cos\u03b8 +1) * [ (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 v1 ]\n\nMultiply both sides by sin\u03b8:\n\nsin\u00b2\u03b8 v1 = (cos\u03b8 +1)(1 - cos\u03b8) v1 \n\nNote that (cos\u03b8 +1)(1 - cos\u03b8) = 1 - cos\u00b2\u03b8 = sin\u00b2\u03b8 \n\nThus, sin\u00b2\u03b8 v1 = sin\u00b2\u03b8 v1 \n\nWhich is an identity. So the equations are dependent, so we can just use one equation to relate v1 and v2. \n\nThus, from equation 1, v2 = [ (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ] v1 \n\nWe can write this as v2 = [ (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ] v1 \n\nBut let's simplify (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8. \n\nRecall that 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2). \n\nTherefore, (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = [2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)] / [2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)] = tan(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) v1 \n\nTherefore, the eigenvector can be written as v1 multiplied by [1; tan(\u03b8/2)].",

That makes sense.\n\nSo the operator P is then (\u0127/2) times (sin\u03b8 * \u03c3_x + cos\u03b8 * \u03c3_z). The Pauli matrices \u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So substituting in:\n\n\u03c3_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. \n\nTherefore, the matrix for P (divided by \u0127/2 for simplicity) is:\n\nsin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,-1]] \n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst term (sin\u03b8 * \u03c3_x):\n\n[0*sin\u03b8, 1*sin\u03b8]\n[1*sin\u03b8, 0*sin\u03b8]\n\n= [0, sin\u03b8]\n  [sin\u03b8, 0]\n\nSecond term (cos\u03b8 * \u03c3_z):\n\n[cos\u03b8, 0]\n[0, -cos\u03b8]\n\nAdding them together:\n\n[ cos\u03b8 + 0, sin\u03b8 + 0 ]\n[ sin\u03b8 + 0, 0 - cos\u03b8 ]\n\nSo the matrix of P (divided by \u0127/2) is:\n\n[ cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8 ]\n[ sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 ]\n\nSo the full operator P is (\u0127/2) multiplied by that matrix. \n\nWe need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2.

Let me write out \u03c3_x and \u03c3_z:\n\n\u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. \n\nSo n_x is sin\u03b8, n_z is cos\u03b8. \n\nPutting it together:\n\nn_x \u03c3_x = sin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[1,0]]\n\nn_z \u03c3_z = cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nAdding them together:\n\nThe top-left element is 0*sin\u03b8 + cos\u03b8*1 = cos\u03b8\n\nThe top-right element is 1*sin\u03b8 + 0*cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8\n\nSimilarly, bottom-left is sin\u03b8 (from \u03c3_x term) and bottom-right is -cos\u03b8 (from \u03c3_z term)\n\nTherefore, the sum n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z is:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8],\n  [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ]\n\nTherefore, P_n = (\u0127/2) times this matrix.\n\nNow, the eigenvalue equation is P_n |v\u27e9 = (+\u0127/2)|v\u27e9.\n\nLet me write the eigenvalue equation:\n\n( (\u0127/2) [ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] ) * |v\u27e9 = (\u0127/2)|v\u27e9 \n\nMultiply both sides by 2/\u0127 to simplify:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] * |v\u27e9 = |v\u27e9 \n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] * [v1; v2] = [v1; v2]\n\nSo let's write this as a matrix equation:\n\ncos\u03b8 * v1 + sin\u03b8 * v2 = v1 \n\nsin\u03b8 * v1 - cos\u03b8 * v2 = v2 \n\nLet me rearrange the equations:\n\nFirst equation:\n\ncos\u03b8 v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = v1 \n\n=> (cos\u03b8 - 1) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0 \n\nSecond equation:\n\nsin\u03b8 v1 - cos\u03b8 v2 = v2 \n\n=> sin\u03b8 v1 - (cos\u03b8 + 1) v2 = 0 \n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1) (cos\u03b8 - 1)v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0 \n\n2) sin\u03b8 v1 - (cos\u03b8 + 1) v2 = 0 \n\nThese two equations must be satisfied simultaneously. Let's try to solve them. \n\nLet me express equation 1 as:\n\nsin\u03b8 v2 = (1 - cos\u03b8) v1 \n\nSo v2 = ( (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ) v1 \n\nSimilarly, equation 2: \n\nsin\u03b8 v1 = (cos\u03b8 +1 ) v2 \n\nSubstituting v2 from equation 1 into equation 2: \n\nsin\u03b8 v1 = (cos\u03b8 +1) * [ (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 v1 ]\n\nMultiply both sides by sin\u03b8:\n\nsin\u00b2\u03b8 v1 = (cos\u03b8 +1)(1 - cos\u03b8) v1 \n\nNote that (cos\u03b8 +1)(1 - cos\u03b8) = 1 - cos\u00b2\u03b8 = sin\u00b2\u03b8 \n\nThus, sin\u00b2\u03b8 v1 = sin\u00b2\u03b8 v1 \n\nWhich is an identity. So the equations are dependent, so we can just use one equation to relate v1 and v2. \n\nThus, from equation 1, v2 = [ (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ] v1 \n\nWe can write this as v2 = [ (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ] v1 \n\nBut let's simplify (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8. \n\nRecall that 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2). \n\nTherefore, (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = [2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)] / [2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)] = tan(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) v1 \n\nTherefore, the eigenvector can be written as v1 multiplied by [1; tan(\u03b8/2)].",
          "text2": "Alternatively, maybe it's expressed differently. Let me confirm. Let\u2019s say the direction is specified by an angle \u03b8 from the z-axis towards the x direction, so the coordinates would be (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). That makes sense.\n\nSo the operator P is then (\u0127/2) times (sin\u03b8 * \u03c3_x + cos\u03b8 * \u03c3_z). The Pauli matrices \u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So substituting in:\n\n\u03c3_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. \n\nTherefore, the matrix for P (divided by \u0127/2 for simplicity) is:\n\nsin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,-1]] \n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst term (sin\u03b8 * \u03c3_x):\n\n[0*sin\u03b8, 1*sin\u03b8]\n[1*sin\u03b8, 0*sin\u03b8]\n\n= [0, sin\u03b8]\n  [sin\u03b8, 0]\n\nSecond term (cos\u03b8 * \u03c3_z):\n\n[cos\u03b8, 0]\n[0, -cos\u03b8]\n\nAdding them together:\n\n[ cos\u03b8 + 0, sin\u03b8 + 0 ]\n[ sin\u03b8 + 0, 0 - cos\u03b8 ]\n\nSo the matrix of P (divided by \u0127/2) is:\n\n[ cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8 ]\n[ sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 ]\n\nSo the full operator P is (\u0127/2) multiplied by that matrix. \n\nWe need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Let's denote the eigenvalue equation as (P) v = (+\u0127/2) v.

Let me write out \u03c3_x and \u03c3_z:\n\n\u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. \n\nSo n_x is sin\u03b8, n_z is cos\u03b8. \n\nPutting it together:\n\nn_x \u03c3_x = sin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[1,0]]\n\nn_z \u03c3_z = cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nAdding them together:\n\nThe top-left element is 0*sin\u03b8 + cos\u03b8*1 = cos\u03b8\n\nThe top-right element is 1*sin\u03b8 + 0*cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8\n\nSimilarly, bottom-left is sin\u03b8 (from \u03c3_x term) and bottom-right is -cos\u03b8 (from \u03c3_z term)\n\nTherefore, the sum n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z is:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8],\n  [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ]\n\nTherefore, P_n = (\u0127/2) times this matrix.\n\nNow, the eigenvalue equation is P_n |v\u27e9 = (+\u0127/2)|v\u27e9.\n\nLet me write the eigenvalue equation:\n\n( (\u0127/2) [ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] ) * |v\u27e9 = (\u0127/2)|v\u27e9 \n\nMultiply both sides by 2/\u0127 to simplify:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] * |v\u27e9 = |v\u27e9 \n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] * [v1; v2] = [v1; v2]\n\nSo let's write this as a matrix equation:\n\ncos\u03b8 * v1 + sin\u03b8 * v2 = v1 \n\nsin\u03b8 * v1 - cos\u03b8 * v2 = v2 \n\nLet me rearrange the equations:\n\nFirst equation:\n\ncos\u03b8 v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = v1 \n\n=> (cos\u03b8 - 1) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0 \n\nSecond equation:\n\nsin\u03b8 v1 - cos\u03b8 v2 = v2 \n\n=> sin\u03b8 v1 - (cos\u03b8 + 1) v2 = 0 \n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1) (cos\u03b8 - 1)v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0 \n\n2) sin\u03b8 v1 - (cos\u03b8 + 1) v2 = 0 \n\nThese two equations must be satisfied simultaneously. Let's try to solve them. \n\nLet me express equation 1 as:\n\nsin\u03b8 v2 = (1 - cos\u03b8) v1 \n\nSo v2 = ( (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ) v1 \n\nSimilarly, equation 2: \n\nsin\u03b8 v1 = (cos\u03b8 +1 ) v2 \n\nSubstituting v2 from equation 1 into equation 2: \n\nsin\u03b8 v1 = (cos\u03b8 +1) * [ (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 v1 ]\n\nMultiply both sides by sin\u03b8:\n\nsin\u00b2\u03b8 v1 = (cos\u03b8 +1)(1 - cos\u03b8) v1 \n\nNote that (cos\u03b8 +1)(1 - cos\u03b8) = 1 - cos\u00b2\u03b8 = sin\u00b2\u03b8 \n\nThus, sin\u00b2\u03b8 v1 = sin\u00b2\u03b8 v1 \n\nWhich is an identity. So the equations are dependent, so we can just use one equation to relate v1 and v2. \n\nThus, from equation 1, v2 = [ (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ] v1 \n\nWe can write this as v2 = [ (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ] v1 \n\nBut let's simplify (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8. \n\nRecall that 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2). \n\nTherefore, (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = [2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)] / [2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)] = tan(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) v1 \n\nTherefore, the eigenvector can be written as v1 multiplied by [1; tan(\u03b8/2)].",
          "text2": "Alternatively, maybe it's expressed differently. Let me confirm. Let\u2019s say the direction is specified by an angle \u03b8 from the z-axis towards the x direction, so the coordinates would be (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). That makes sense.\n\nSo the operator P is then (\u0127/2) times (sin\u03b8 * \u03c3_x + cos\u03b8 * \u03c3_z). The Pauli matrices \u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So substituting in:\n\n\u03c3_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. \n\nTherefore, the matrix for P (divided by \u0127/2 for simplicity) is:\n\nsin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,-1]] \n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst term (sin\u03b8 * \u03c3_x):\n\n[0*sin\u03b8, 1*sin\u03b8]\n[1*sin\u03b8, 0*sin\u03b8]\n\n= [0, sin\u03b8]\n  [sin\u03b8, 0]\n\nSecond term (cos\u03b8 * \u03c3_z):\n\n[cos\u03b8, 0]\n[0, -cos\u03b8]\n\nAdding them together:\n\n[ cos\u03b8 + 0, sin\u03b8 + 0 ]\n[ sin\u03b8 + 0, 0 - cos\u03b8 ]\n\nSo the matrix of P (divided by \u0127/2) is:\n\n[ cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8 ]\n[ sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 ]\n\nSo the full operator P is (\u0127/2) multiplied by that matrix. \n\nWe need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Let's denote the eigenvalue equation as (P) v = (+\u0127/2) v.

Let me write out \u03c3_x and \u03c3_z:\n\n\u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. \n\nSo n_x is sin\u03b8, n_z is cos\u03b8. \n\nPutting it together:\n\nn_x \u03c3_x = sin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[1,0]]\n\nn_z \u03c3_z = cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nAdding them together:\n\nThe top-left element is 0*sin\u03b8 + cos\u03b8*1 = cos\u03b8\n\nThe top-right element is 1*sin\u03b8 + 0*cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8\n\nSimilarly, bottom-left is sin\u03b8 (from \u03c3_x term) and bottom-right is -cos\u03b8 (from \u03c3_z term)\n\nTherefore, the sum n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z is:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8],\n  [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ]\n\nTherefore, P_n = (\u0127/2) times this matrix.\n\nNow, the eigenvalue equation is P_n |v\u27e9 = (+\u0127/2)|v\u27e9.\n\nLet me write the eigenvalue equation:\n\n( (\u0127/2) [ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] ) * |v\u27e9 = (\u0127/2)|v\u27e9 \n\nMultiply both sides by 2/\u0127 to simplify:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] * |v\u27e9 = |v\u27e9 \n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] * [v1; v2] = [v1; v2]\n\nSo let's write this as a matrix equation:\n\ncos\u03b8 * v1 + sin\u03b8 * v2 = v1 \n\nsin\u03b8 * v1 - cos\u03b8 * v2 = v2 \n\nLet me rearrange the equations:\n\nFirst equation:\n\ncos\u03b8 v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = v1 \n\n=> (cos\u03b8 - 1) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0 \n\nSecond equation:\n\nsin\u03b8 v1 - cos\u03b8 v2 = v2 \n\n=> sin\u03b8 v1 - (cos\u03b8 + 1) v2 = 0 \n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1) (cos\u03b8 - 1)v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0 \n\n2) sin\u03b8 v1 - (cos\u03b8 + 1) v2 = 0 \n\nThese two equations must be satisfied simultaneously. Let's try to solve them. \n\nLet me express equation 1 as:\n\nsin\u03b8 v2 = (1 - cos\u03b8) v1 \n\nSo v2 = ( (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ) v1 \n\nSimilarly, equation 2: \n\nsin\u03b8 v1 = (cos\u03b8 +1 ) v2 \n\nSubstituting v2 from equation 1 into equation 2: \n\nsin\u03b8 v1 = (cos\u03b8 +1) * [ (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 v1 ]\n\nMultiply both sides by sin\u03b8:\n\nsin\u00b2\u03b8 v1 = (cos\u03b8 +1)(1 - cos\u03b8) v1 \n\nNote that (cos\u03b8 +1)(1 - cos\u03b8) = 1 - cos\u00b2\u03b8 = sin\u00b2\u03b8 \n\nThus, sin\u00b2\u03b8 v1 = sin\u00b2\u03b8 v1 \n\nWhich is an identity. So the equations are dependent, so we can just use one equation to relate v1 and v2. \n\nThus, from equation 1, v2 = [ (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ] v1 \n\nWe can write this as v2 = [ (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ] v1 \n\nBut let's simplify (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8. \n\nRecall that 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2). \n\nTherefore, (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = [2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)] / [2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)] = tan(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) v1 \n\nTherefore, the eigenvector can be written as v1 multiplied by [1; tan(\u03b8/2)].",
          "text2": "Alternatively, maybe it's expressed differently. Let me confirm. Let\u2019s say the direction is specified by an angle \u03b8 from the z-axis towards the x direction, so the coordinates would be (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). That makes sense.\n\nSo the operator P is then (\u0127/2) times (sin\u03b8 * \u03c3_x + cos\u03b8 * \u03c3_z). The Pauli matrices \u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So substituting in:\n\n\u03c3_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. \n\nTherefore, the matrix for P (divided by \u0127/2 for simplicity) is:\n\nsin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,-1]] \n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst term (sin\u03b8 * \u03c3_x):\n\n[0*sin\u03b8, 1*sin\u03b8]\n[1*sin\u03b8, 0*sin\u03b8]\n\n= [0, sin\u03b8]\n  [sin\u03b8, 0]\n\nSecond term (cos\u03b8 * \u03c3_z):\n\n[cos\u03b8, 0]\n[0, -cos\u03b8]\n\nAdding them together:\n\n[ cos\u03b8 + 0, sin\u03b8 + 0 ]\n[ sin\u03b8 + 0, 0 - cos\u03b8 ]\n\nSo the matrix of P (divided by \u0127/2) is:\n\n[ cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8 ]\n[ sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 ]\n\nSo the full operator P is (\u0127/2) multiplied by that matrix. \n\nWe need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Let's denote the eigenvalue equation as (P) v = (+\u0127/2) v.

Let me write out \u03c3_x and \u03c3_z:\n\n\u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. \n\nSo n_x is sin\u03b8, n_z is cos\u03b8. \n\nPutting it together:\n\nn_x \u03c3_x = sin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[1,0]]\n\nn_z \u03c3_z = cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nAdding them together:\n\nThe top-left element is 0*sin\u03b8 + cos\u03b8*1 = cos\u03b8\n\nThe top-right element is 1*sin\u03b8 + 0*cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8\n\nSimilarly, bottom-left is sin\u03b8 (from \u03c3_x term) and bottom-right is -cos\u03b8 (from \u03c3_z term)\n\nTherefore, the sum n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z is:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8],\n  [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ]\n\nTherefore, P_n = (\u0127/2) times this matrix.\n\nNow, the eigenvalue equation is P_n |v\u27e9 = (+\u0127/2)|v\u27e9.\n\nLet me write the eigenvalue equation:\n\n( (\u0127/2) [ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] ) * |v\u27e9 = (\u0127/2)|v\u27e9 \n\nMultiply both sides by 2/\u0127 to simplify:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] * |v\u27e9 = |v\u27e9 \n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] * [v1; v2] = [v1; v2]\n\nSo let's write this as a matrix equation:\n\ncos\u03b8 * v1 + sin\u03b8 * v2 = v1 \n\nsin\u03b8 * v1 - cos\u03b8 * v2 = v2 \n\nLet me rearrange the equations:\n\nFirst equation:\n\ncos\u03b8 v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = v1 \n\n=> (cos\u03b8 - 1) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0 \n\nSecond equation:\n\nsin\u03b8 v1 - cos\u03b8 v2 = v2 \n\n=> sin\u03b8 v1 - (cos\u03b8 + 1) v2 = 0 \n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1) (cos\u03b8 - 1)v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0 \n\n2) sin\u03b8 v1 - (cos\u03b8 + 1) v2 = 0 \n\nThese two equations must be satisfied simultaneously. Let's try to solve them. \n\nLet me express equation 1 as:\n\nsin\u03b8 v2 = (1 - cos\u03b8) v1 \n\nSo v2 = ( (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ) v1 \n\nSimilarly, equation 2: \n\nsin\u03b8 v1 = (cos\u03b8 +1 ) v2 \n\nSubstituting v2 from equation 1 into equation 2: \n\nsin\u03b8 v1 = (cos\u03b8 +1) * [ (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 v1 ]\n\nMultiply both sides by sin\u03b8:\n\nsin\u00b2\u03b8 v1 = (cos\u03b8 +1)(1 - cos\u03b8) v1 \n\nNote that (cos\u03b8 +1)(1 - cos\u03b8) = 1 - cos\u00b2\u03b8 = sin\u00b2\u03b8 \n\nThus, sin\u00b2\u03b8 v1 = sin\u00b2\u03b8 v1 \n\nWhich is an identity. So the equations are dependent, so we can just use one equation to relate v1 and v2. \n\nThus, from equation 1, v2 = [ (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ] v1 \n\nWe can write this as v2 = [ (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ] v1 \n\nBut let's simplify (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8. \n\nRecall that 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2). \n\nTherefore, (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = [2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)] / [2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)] = tan(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) v1 \n\nTherefore, the eigenvector can be written as v1 multiplied by [1; tan(\u03b8/2)].",
          "text2": "Alternatively, maybe it's expressed differently. Let me confirm. Let\u2019s say the direction is specified by an angle \u03b8 from the z-axis towards the x direction, so the coordinates would be (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). That makes sense.\n\nSo the operator P is then (\u0127/2) times (sin\u03b8 * \u03c3_x + cos\u03b8 * \u03c3_z). The Pauli matrices \u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So substituting in:\n\n\u03c3_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. \n\nTherefore, the matrix for P (divided by \u0127/2 for simplicity) is:\n\nsin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,-1]] \n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst term (sin\u03b8 * \u03c3_x):\n\n[0*sin\u03b8, 1*sin\u03b8]\n[1*sin\u03b8, 0*sin\u03b8]\n\n= [0, sin\u03b8]\n  [sin\u03b8, 0]\n\nSecond term (cos\u03b8 * \u03c3_z):\n\n[cos\u03b8, 0]\n[0, -cos\u03b8]\n\nAdding them together:\n\n[ cos\u03b8 + 0, sin\u03b8 + 0 ]\n[ sin\u03b8 + 0, 0 - cos\u03b8 ]\n\nSo the matrix of P (divided by \u0127/2) is:\n\n[ cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8 ]\n[ sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 ]\n\nSo the full operator P is (\u0127/2) multiplied by that matrix. \n\nWe need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Let's denote the eigenvalue equation as (P) v = (+\u0127/2) v.

Let me write out \u03c3_x and \u03c3_z:\n\n\u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. \n\nSo n_x is sin\u03b8, n_z is cos\u03b8. \n\nPutting it together:\n\nn_x \u03c3_x = sin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[1,0]]\n\nn_z \u03c3_z = cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nAdding them together:\n\nThe top-left element is 0*sin\u03b8 + cos\u03b8*1 = cos\u03b8\n\nThe top-right element is 1*sin\u03b8 + 0*cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8\n\nSimilarly, bottom-left is sin\u03b8 (from \u03c3_x term) and bottom-right is -cos\u03b8 (from \u03c3_z term)\n\nTherefore, the sum n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z is:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8],\n  [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ]\n\nTherefore, P_n = (\u0127/2) times this matrix.\n\nNow, the eigenvalue equation is P_n |v\u27e9 = (+\u0127/2)|v\u27e9.\n\nLet me write the eigenvalue equation:\n\n( (\u0127/2) [ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] ) * |v\u27e9 = (\u0127/2)|v\u27e9 \n\nMultiply both sides by 2/\u0127 to simplify:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] * |v\u27e9 = |v\u27e9 \n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] * [v1; v2] = [v1; v2]\n\nSo let's write this as a matrix equation:\n\ncos\u03b8 * v1 + sin\u03b8 * v2 = v1 \n\nsin\u03b8 * v1 - cos\u03b8 * v2 = v2 \n\nLet me rearrange the equations:\n\nFirst equation:\n\ncos\u03b8 v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = v1 \n\n=> (cos\u03b8 - 1) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0 \n\nSecond equation:\n\nsin\u03b8 v1 - cos\u03b8 v2 = v2 \n\n=> sin\u03b8 v1 - (cos\u03b8 + 1) v2 = 0 \n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1) (cos\u03b8 - 1)v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0 \n\n2) sin\u03b8 v1 - (cos\u03b8 + 1) v2 = 0 \n\nThese two equations must be satisfied simultaneously. Let's try to solve them. \n\nLet me express equation 1 as:\n\nsin\u03b8 v2 = (1 - cos\u03b8) v1 \n\nSo v2 = ( (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ) v1 \n\nSimilarly, equation 2: \n\nsin\u03b8 v1 = (cos\u03b8 +1 ) v2 \n\nSubstituting v2 from equation 1 into equation 2: \n\nsin\u03b8 v1 = (cos\u03b8 +1) * [ (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 v1 ]\n\nMultiply both sides by sin\u03b8:\n\nsin\u00b2\u03b8 v1 = (cos\u03b8 +1)(1 - cos\u03b8) v1 \n\nNote that (cos\u03b8 +1)(1 - cos\u03b8) = 1 - cos\u00b2\u03b8 = sin\u00b2\u03b8 \n\nThus, sin\u00b2\u03b8 v1 = sin\u00b2\u03b8 v1 \n\nWhich is an identity. So the equations are dependent, so we can just use one equation to relate v1 and v2. \n\nThus, from equation 1, v2 = [ (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ] v1 \n\nWe can write this as v2 = [ (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ] v1 \n\nBut let's simplify (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8. \n\nRecall that 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2). \n\nTherefore, (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = [2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)] / [2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)] = tan(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) v1 \n\nTherefore, the eigenvector can be written as v1 multiplied by [1; tan(\u03b8/2)].",
          "text2": "Alternatively, maybe it's expressed differently. Let me confirm. Let\u2019s say the direction is specified by an angle \u03b8 from the z-axis towards the x direction, so the coordinates would be (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). That makes sense.\n\nSo the operator P is then (\u0127/2) times (sin\u03b8 * \u03c3_x + cos\u03b8 * \u03c3_z). The Pauli matrices \u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So substituting in:\n\n\u03c3_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. \n\nTherefore, the matrix for P (divided by \u0127/2 for simplicity) is:\n\nsin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,-1]] \n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst term (sin\u03b8 * \u03c3_x):\n\n[0*sin\u03b8, 1*sin\u03b8]\n[1*sin\u03b8, 0*sin\u03b8]\n\n= [0, sin\u03b8]\n  [sin\u03b8, 0]\n\nSecond term (cos\u03b8 * \u03c3_z):\n\n[cos\u03b8, 0]\n[0, -cos\u03b8]\n\nAdding them together:\n\n[ cos\u03b8 + 0, sin\u03b8 + 0 ]\n[ sin\u03b8 + 0, 0 - cos\u03b8 ]\n\nSo the matrix of P (divided by \u0127/2) is:\n\n[ cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8 ]\n[ sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 ]\n\nSo the full operator P is (\u0127/2) multiplied by that matrix. \n\nWe need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Let's denote the eigenvalue equation as (P) v = (+\u0127/2) v.

Recall that 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2).

Substitute that into the right side:\n\n(n_z\u00b2 -1) = - (1 - n_z\u00b2) \u2192 n_z\u00b2 -1 = -1 + n_z\u00b2 \u2192 which is 0=0. So the equations are consistent, as expected. \n\nTherefore, the eigenvectors can be found by choosing one equation. Let me use the first equation to express v2 in terms of v1:\n\nv2 = [(n_z -1)/ (-n_x)] v1",

However, in the standard parametrization, the spherical coordinates for a direction in x-z plane would have phi=0 or pi (since phi is the angle in the xy plane from x-axis).

So the equations are dependent, so we can just use one equation to relate v1 and v2. \n\nThus, from equation 1, v2 = [ (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ] v1 \n\nWe can write this as v2 = [ (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ] v1 \n\nBut let's simplify (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8. \n\nRecall that 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2). \n\nTherefore, (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = [2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)] / [2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)] = tan(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) v1 \n\nTherefore, the eigenvector can be written as v1 multiplied by [1; tan(\u03b8/2)].",

That makes sense.\n\nSo the operator P is then (\u0127/2) times (sin\u03b8 * \u03c3_x + cos\u03b8 * \u03c3_z). The Pauli matrices \u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So substituting in:\n\n\u03c3_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. \n\nTherefore, the matrix for P (divided by \u0127/2 for simplicity) is:\n\nsin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,-1]] \n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst term (sin\u03b8 * \u03c3_x):\n\n[0*sin\u03b8, 1*sin\u03b8]\n[1*sin\u03b8, 0*sin\u03b8]\n\n= [0, sin\u03b8]\n  [sin\u03b8, 0]\n\nSecond term (cos\u03b8 * \u03c3_z):\n\n[cos\u03b8, 0]\n[0, -cos\u03b8]\n\nAdding them together:\n\n[ cos\u03b8 + 0, sin\u03b8 + 0 ]\n[ sin\u03b8 + 0, 0 - cos\u03b8 ]\n\nSo the matrix of P (divided by \u0127/2) is:\n\n[ cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8 ]\n[ sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 ]\n\nSo the full operator P is (\u0127/2) multiplied by that matrix. \n\nWe need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2.

Recall that 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2).

So, we can set up the equation (\u03c3_x sin\u03b8 + \u03c3_z cos\u03b8) |v> = (1) |v>, since the eigenvalue is +1 (since the eigenvalue of P_n is \u0127/2, so the operator (\u03c3 ... ) has eigenvalues 1 and -1 when multiplied by \u0127/2).\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n[ cos\u03b8    sin\u03b8 ] [v1]   = 1*[v1]\n[ sin\u03b8  -cos\u03b8 ] [v2]       [v2]\n\nSo the equations are:\n\ncos\u03b8 * v1 + sin\u03b8 * v2 = v1\n\nsin\u03b8 * v1 - cos\u03b8 * v2 = v2\n\nLet me rearrange the first equation:\n\ncos\u03b8 v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = v1 \u2192 (cos\u03b8 -1)v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0\n\nSecond equation:\n\nsin\u03b8 v1 - cos\u03b8 v2 = v2 \u2192 sin\u03b8 v1 - (cos\u03b8 +1) v2 = 0\n\nSo now we have a system of equations:\n\n( cos\u03b8 -1 ) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0\n\nsin\u03b8 v1 - (cos\u03b8 +1 ) v2 = 0\n\nThese two equations must be consistent.

Let's compute each component:\n\n\u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so n_x \u03c3_x is [[0, n_x],[n_x, 0]]\n\n\u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so n_z \u03c3_z is [[n_z, 0],[0, -n_z]]\n\nAdding these together gives the matrix:\n\n[ [n_z, n_x ],\n  [n_x, -n_z ] ]\n\nSo the matrix M = n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z is:\n\nM = [[n_z, n_x],\n     [n_x, -n_z]]\n\nThe eigenvalue equation is M v = 1 * v.\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector v = [v1; v2] such that:\n\nM * v = v.\n\nSo writing the equations:\n\nFirst equation: n_z v1 + n_x v2 = v1\n\nSecond equation: n_x v1 - n_z v2 = v2\n\nLet me rearrange these equations.\n\nFirst equation: (n_z - 1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0\n\nSecond equation: n_x v1 - (n_z + 1) v2 = 0\n\nThese two equations must be satisfied. Since we have two equations and two unknowns, they should be consistent.\n\nLet me write them as a system:\n\n(n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0\n\nn_x v1 - (n_z +1) v2 =0\n\nTo have a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero, but since we are looking for eigenvectors, the system is dependent, so we can solve for the ratio of v1 and v2.\n\nLet me take the first equation: (n_z -1)v1 = -n_x v2 => v2 = [(n_z -1)/ (-n_x)] v1\n\nSecond equation: n_x v1 = (n_z +1) v2 => v2 = (n_x)/(n_z +1) v1\n\nSo setting the two expressions for v2 equal:\n\n[(n_z -1)/ (-n_x)] v1 = [n_x/(n_z +1)] v1 \n\nAssuming v1 \u22600,\n\n(n_z -1)/(-n_x) = n_x/(n_z +1)\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n(n_z -1)(n_z +1) = -n_x^2\n\n(n_z)^2 -1 = -n_x^2\n\nBut since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1, so n_x^2 = 1 - n_z^2. Substitute that into the right side:\n\n(n_z\u00b2 -1) = - (1 - n_z\u00b2) \u2192 n_z\u00b2 -1 = -1 + n_z\u00b2 \u2192 which is 0=0. So the equations are consistent, as expected. \n\nTherefore, the eigenvectors can be found by choosing one equation. Let me use the first equation to express v2 in terms of v1:\n\nv2 = [(n_z -1)/ (-n_x)] v1",

However, in the standard parametrization, the spherical coordinates for a direction in x-z plane would have phi=0 or pi (since phi is the angle in the xy plane from x-axis). So the y-component is zero, so the eigenvector doesn't need a phase because the direction is along x-z. Therefore, the eigenvector is real? Let me see.",

Since the vector is (1, tan(\u03b8/2)), the norm squared is 1 + tan\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = sec\u00b2(\u03b8/2). So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt( sec\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) = cos(\u03b8/2). \n\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector is:\n\nv1 = cos(\u03b8/2), \n\nv2 = sin(\u03b8/2)",

So substituting in:\n\n\u03c3_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. \n\nTherefore, the matrix for P (divided by \u0127/2 for simplicity) is:\n\nsin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,-1]] \n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst term (sin\u03b8 * \u03c3_x):\n\n[0*sin\u03b8, 1*sin\u03b8]\n[1*sin\u03b8, 0*sin\u03b8]\n\n= [0, sin\u03b8]\n  [sin\u03b8, 0]\n\nSecond term (cos\u03b8 * \u03c3_z):\n\n[cos\u03b8, 0]\n[0, -cos\u03b8]\n\nAdding them together:\n\n[ cos\u03b8 + 0, sin\u03b8 + 0 ]\n[ sin\u03b8 + 0, 0 - cos\u03b8 ]\n\nSo the matrix of P (divided by \u0127/2) is:\n\n[ cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8 ]\n[ sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 ]\n\nSo the full operator P is (\u0127/2) multiplied by that matrix. \n\nWe need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Let's denote the eigenvalue equation as (P) v = (+\u0127/2) v. Dividing both sides by \u0127/2, we can write the equation:\n\n[ cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8 ] [v1]   = +1 [v1]\n[ sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 ] [v2]      [v2]\n\nSo the matrix equation (without \u0127/2 scaling) is:\n\ncos\u03b8 * v1 + sin\u03b8 * v2 = v1\n\nsin\u03b8 * v1 - cos\u03b8 * v2 = v2\n\nRearranging the first equation:\n\ncos\u03b8 v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = v1 \u2192 (cos\u03b8 - 1) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0\n\nSecond equation:\n\nsin\u03b8 v1 - cos\u03b8 v2 = v2 \u2192 sin\u03b8 v1 - (cos\u03b8 + 1) v2 = 0\n\nSo we have the system:\n\n( cos\u03b8 - 1 ) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0  --> Equation 1\n\nsin\u03b8 v1 - ( cos\u03b8 + 1 ) v2 = 0  --> Equation 2\n\nWe can solve these equations. Let me see if they are consistent. Let's express v2 from Equation 1:\n\nFrom Equation 1: v2 = [ (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ] v1",

The eigenvalues of the operator P_n will be \u00b1\u0127/2. So, we can set up the equation (\u03c3_x sin\u03b8 + \u03c3_z cos\u03b8) |v> = (1) |v>, since the eigenvalue is +1 (since the eigenvalue of P_n is \u0127/2, so the operator (\u03c3 ... ) has eigenvalues 1 and -1 when multiplied by \u0127/2).\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n[ cos\u03b8    sin\u03b8 ] [v1]   = 1*[v1]\n[ sin\u03b8  -cos\u03b8 ] [v2]       [v2]\n\nSo the equations are:\n\ncos\u03b8 * v1 + sin\u03b8 * v2 = v1\n\nsin\u03b8 * v1 - cos\u03b8 * v2 = v2\n\nLet me rearrange the first equation:\n\ncos\u03b8 v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = v1 \u2192 (cos\u03b8 -1)v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0\n\nSecond equation:\n\nsin\u03b8 v1 - cos\u03b8 v2 = v2 \u2192 sin\u03b8 v1 - (cos\u03b8 +1) v2 = 0\n\nSo now we have a system of equations:\n\n( cos\u03b8 -1 ) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0\n\nsin\u03b8 v1 - (cos\u03b8 +1 ) v2 = 0\n\nThese two equations must be consistent. Let me see if they are multiples of each other. Let's see: Let's take the first equation and see if the second can be written as a multiple.\n\nSuppose I multiply the first equation by some factor k to get the second equation.\n\nSo:\n\nk*(cos\u03b8 -1) = sin\u03b8 (coefficient of v1)\n\nand\n\nk*sin\u03b8 = - (cos\u03b8 +1) (coefficient of v2)\n\nSo, from first part: k = sin\u03b8 / (cos\u03b8 -1)\n\nFrom second part: k = [ - (cos\u03b8 +1) ] / sin\u03b8\n\nSet equal:\n\nsin\u03b8/(cos\u03b8 -1) = [ - (cos\u03b8 +1) ] / sin\u03b8\n\nCross-multiplying: sin\u00b2\u03b8 = - (cos\u03b8 +1)(cos\u03b8 -1)\n\nRight-hand side: - (cos\u00b2\u03b8 -1) = -cos\u00b2\u03b8 +1 = 1 - cos\u00b2\u03b8 = sin\u00b2\u03b8. So yes, that's equal. So the two equations are indeed multiples, so the system is consistent.\n\nTherefore, to find the eigenvectors, we can take any one equation. Let's take the first equation:\n\n( cos\u03b8 -1 ) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 = [ (1 - cos\u03b8)/ sin\u03b8 ] v1\n\nHmm, let me compute (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8. Let's recall that (1 - cos\u03b8) = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2). So:\n\n(1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = [2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)] / [2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)] ) = tan(\u03b8/2)\n\nTherefore, v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) v1.",

          "text2": "Alternatively, perhaps the angle theta in the options is the polar angle. \n\nIn any case, the eigenvector comes out as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C. The other options have factors like sqrt(2/3) or include hbar, but the eigenvectors are direction-dependent and normalized, so they shouldn't have hbar in their components since they are vectors in the Hilbert space (spinors), which are dimensionless. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA and D have hbar in the components, which is incorrect because eigenvectors are just complex numbers (spinors) without units. The eigenvalues have units of \u0127/2, but the eigenvectors are unit vectors in the spin space. So options A and D can be eliminated. \n\nOption B has e^{i phi} sin(theta), but since the direction is in x-z plane, phi would be 0 or \u03c0, so e^{i phi} would be \u00b11. However the general form in option B would allow for any phi, but in our case, since the direction is restricted to x-z, the eigenvector should not require a phase. \n\nOption C is purely real (if theta is real). Therefore, the correct answer is C.",
