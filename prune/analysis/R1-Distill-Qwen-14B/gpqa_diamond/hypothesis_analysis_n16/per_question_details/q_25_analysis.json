So maybe A is an alcohol that undergoes dehydration to form the ketone. The structure of the product is 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one. Spiro compounds have two rings fused at a single atom. So the spiro center would be at the carbon where the two rings meet. The substituents are 2 and 8 methyl groups. The ketone is at position 6. So the reactant A would be the corresponding alcohol. The question is, what's the alcohol's structure? The product is a ketone, so the alcohol would have an -OH on the same carbon that becomes the ketone. So replacing the ketone's oxygen with an -OH would give the alcohol. So the reactant A should be 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol. That would make sense because when you dehydrate the alcohol (using acid), the hydroxyl group would leave, forming a carbocation which could then form the ketone. \n\nLooking at the options, option A and D have A as that alcohol.

When the alcohol loses water, the adjacent carbon would lose a hydrogen, leading to a carbocation which then loses another proton to form the ketone. So the position of the hydroxyl group in A must be such that when it dehydrates, it forms the ketone at position 6. Looking at the product's name, it's 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one.
