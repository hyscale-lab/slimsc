The half-life T1/2 is related by ln(2)/\u03bb. Let me see, since P=1 - e^{-\u03bb T} =0.32 for T=100. So e^{-\u03bb*100}=0.68. So \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100 \u22480.0038566 per minute as before.

          "text2": "Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to see that the decay probability over 100 minutes is 32%, so the half-life can be found. Let me see. The half-life T1/2 is related by ln(2)/\u03bb. Let me see, since P=1 - e^{-\u03bb T} =0.32 for T=100. So e^{-\u03bb*100}=0.68. So \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100 \u22480.0038566 per minute as before. The half-life T1/2 would be ln(2)/0.0038566 \u2248 0.6931/0.0038566 \u2248 180 minutes? Let me compute 0.6931 divided by 0.0038566. 0.0038566 * 180 = (0.0038566 * 100) = 0.38566; times 1.8: 0.38566*1.8 = 0.694188. So yes, exactly ln(2) is about 0.6931, so the half-life is approximately 180 minutes. So the half-life is 180 minutes. \n\nNow, the question is, after 50 minutes, what's the chance of decay in the next 150 minutes (total 200 from start). The probability of not decaying in 200 minutes is e^(-\u03bb*200) = e^(- (ln(0.68)/100)*200 ) = (0.68)^2 = 0.4624. So the probability of decaying by 200 is 1 - 0.4624 = 0.5376. But since we have already survived 50 minutes, the conditional probability is (probability decayed by 200) divided by (probability survived 50). The probability survived 50 is e^(-\u03bb*50) = sqrt(e^(-\u03bb*100)) = sqrt(0.68) \u2248 0.8246. So 0.5376 / 0.8246 \u2248 0.5376/(0.8246) \u2248 let's compute: 0.5376 divided by 0.8246.

So yes, exactly ln(2) is about 0.6931, so the half-life is approximately 180 minutes. So the half-life is 180 minutes. \n\nNow, the question is, after 50 minutes, what's the chance of decay in the next 150 minutes (total 200 from start). The probability of not decaying in 200 minutes is e^(-\u03bb*200) = e^(- (ln(0.68)/100)*200 ) = (0.68)^2 = 0.4624. So the probability of decaying by 200 is 1 - 0.4624 = 0.5376. But since we have already survived 50 minutes, the conditional probability is (probability decayed by 200) divided by (probability survived 50). The probability survived 50 is e^(-\u03bb*50) = sqrt(e^(-\u03bb*100)) = sqrt(0.68) \u2248 0.8246. So 0.5376 / 0.8246 \u2248 0.5376/(0.8246) \u2248 let's compute: 0.5376 divided by 0.8246. Let me see, 0.8246 *0.65=0.536, so approximately 0.65?",

So the time we're looking at is the next 150 minutes. So the probability is P(t=150), which is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150). \n\nBut first, we need to find \u03bb using the given 100-minute data. \n\nStarting with P(100) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100) = 0.32. \n\nSo solving for \u03bb: \n\ne^(-\u03bb*100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\nTake natural log of both sides:\n\n-\u03bb *100 = ln(0.68)\n\nTherefore, \u03bb = - (ln 0.68)/100. Let me compute that value numerically. \n\nCalculating ln(0.68). Let me recall that ln(0.5) is about -0.6931, and ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, so 0.68 would be between those.

The half-life T1/2 is related by ln(2)/\u03bb. Let me see, since P=1 - e^{-\u03bb T} =0.32 for T=100. So e^{-\u03bb*100}=0.68. So \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100 \u22480.0038566 per minute as before. The half-life T1/2 would be ln(2)/0.0038566 \u2248 0.6931/0.0038566 \u2248 180 minutes? Let me compute 0.6931 divided by 0.0038566. 0.0038566 * 180 = (0.0038566 * 100) = 0.38566; times 1.8: 0.38566*1.8 = 0.694188. So yes, exactly ln(2) is about 0.6931, so the half-life is approximately 180 minutes. So the half-life is 180 minutes. \n\nNow, the question is, after 50 minutes, what's the chance of decay in the next 150 minutes (total 200 from start). The probability of not decaying in 200 minutes is e^(-\u03bb*200) = e^(- (ln(0.68)/100)*200 ) = (0.68)^2 = 0.4624. So the probability of decaying by 200 is 1 - 0.4624 = 0.5376. But since we have already survived 50 minutes, the conditional probability is (probability decayed by 200) divided by (probability survived 50). The probability survived 50 is e^(-\u03bb*50) = sqrt(e^(-\u03bb*100)) = sqrt(0.68) \u2248 0.8246. So 0.5376 / 0.8246 \u2248 0.5376/(0.8246) \u2248 let's compute: 0.5376 divided by 0.8246. Let me see, 0.8246 *0.65=0.536, so approximately 0.65?",
          "text2": "Wait, but actually, maybe I need to adjust for the time already passed?\n\nLet me structure this step by step. \n\nFirst, find the decay constant \u03bb using the given 32% decay probability over 100 minutes. \n\nThe decay probability P(t) is 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). So:\n\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 100)\n\nSo e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n\n-100\u03bb = ln(0.68)\n\nSo \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100. Let me calculate that. Let me compute ln(0.68). Hmm, ln(0.68) is approximately... Well, ln(0.5) is about -0.6931, ln(0.7) is around -0.3567, so 0.68 would be between those. Let me compute it numerically. Let's see, maybe better to just keep it symbolic for now.\n\nNow, the problem is, after 50 minutes, it hasn't decayed. The probability that it decays between time 50 and 50+150=200 minutes.

The numerator is S(50) - S(200). So the probability is (S(50) - S(200))/S(50) = 1 - S(200)/S(50).\n\nNow, S(200) is e^{-200\u03bb} = (e^{-100\u03bb})^2 = (0.68)^2 = 0.4624.\n\nS(50) is sqrt(0.68) \u2248 0.8246.\n\nSo S(200)/S(50) = 0.4624 / 0.8246 \u2248 0.5607.

          "text2": "Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to see that the decay probability over 100 minutes is 32%, so the half-life can be found. Let me see. The half-life T1/2 is related by ln(2)/\u03bb. Let me see, since P=1 - e^{-\u03bb T} =0.32 for T=100. So e^{-\u03bb*100}=0.68. So \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100 \u22480.0038566 per minute as before. The half-life T1/2 would be ln(2)/0.0038566 \u2248 0.6931/0.0038566 \u2248 180 minutes? Let me compute 0.6931 divided by 0.0038566. 0.0038566 * 180 = (0.0038566 * 100) = 0.38566; times 1.8: 0.38566*1.8 = 0.694188. So yes, exactly ln(2) is about 0.6931, so the half-life is approximately 180 minutes. So the half-life is 180 minutes. \n\nNow, the question is, after 50 minutes, what's the chance of decay in the next 150 minutes (total 200 from start). The probability of not decaying in 200 minutes is e^(-\u03bb*200) = e^(- (ln(0.68)/100)*200 ) = (0.68)^2 = 0.4624. So the probability of decaying by 200 is 1 - 0.4624 = 0.5376. But since we have already survived 50 minutes, the conditional probability is (probability decayed by 200) divided by (probability survived 50). The probability survived 50 is e^(-\u03bb*50) = sqrt(e^(-\u03bb*100)) = sqrt(0.68) \u2248 0.8246. So 0.5376 / 0.8246 \u2248 0.5376/(0.8246) \u2248 let's compute: 0.5376 divided by 0.8246.
