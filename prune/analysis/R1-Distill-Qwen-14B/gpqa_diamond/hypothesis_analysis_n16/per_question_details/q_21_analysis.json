Since the benzene ring is aromatic, the carbonyl groups are in conjugation, making them less prone to rearrangement. In contrast, the cyclohexane trione, being a non-aromatic ring, might be more flexible. Therefore, perhaps the answer for part A is that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism, so the one that does NOT show it would be benzoquinone.",

For example, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it won't have chiral centers. Suppose the structure is symmetric, meaning that the two ester groups are on opposite sides. Then, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the double bond. So in that case, there are no chiral centers, so no optical isomerism. \n\nTherefore, dimethyl fumarate would not have optical isomerism because there are no chiral centers. \n\nOn the other hand, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate had a chiral center at the second carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group), as we determined earlier, so it can have enantiomers, hence optical isomerism. \n\nTherefore, for part B, the answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism. \n\nNow looking back at the options. \n\nOption B says A = benzoquinone (which we think is correct for part A) and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (which matches our conclusion for B). \n\nOption D says A = benzoquinone and B = dimethyl fumarate (but we said B is the methyl compound).

Since that carbon has four different groups, it's a chiral center. Therefore, that compound would have enantiomers, showing optical isomerism. \n\nTherefore, the answer for part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. \n\nNow looking at the options:\n\nOption B says A = benzoquinone (which is correct for part A as we thought) and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (which is correct for part B). Option D has A as benzoquinone and B as dimethyl fumarate, which would be wrong for B. \n\nSo the correct option is B.",
