Let's plug in the numbers here, but remember that this is an approximation valid only when dark energy is negligible, i.e., when (1+z)^3 term dominates over the \u03a9_Lambda term. For z=7.66, 0.3*(1+z)^3 \u2248 195 as before, and 0.7 is negligible, so this approximation holds. So using this formula:\n\nPlugging in z=7.66, sqrt(1+z)=sqrt(8.66)\u22482.943.\n\nSo 1/sqrt(1+z) \u2248 1/2.943 \u22480.34.\n\nThus, 1 - 0.34 =0.66. Then multiplied by 2 gives 1.32.\n\nThen D_c \u2248 (c/(H0 * sqrt(0.3))) *1.32\n\nBut H0 is given as 70 km/s/Mpc. Let's compute this:\n\nFirst, c is 3e5 km/s. So c/H0 = (3e5 km/s)/(70 km/s/Mpc) = (3e5 /70) Mpc \u22484285.7 Mpc. Then divide by sqrt(0.3) \u22480.5477, so:\n\n4285.7 /0.5477 \u2248 ~7820 Mpc. Then multiply by 1.32 gives 7820 *1.32\u2248 10,322 Mpc. Which is about 10.32 Gpc. But none of the options are that high.",

Let me approximate the integral from 0 to 5.5.\n\nLet me divide the integral into a few intervals. For example, from 0 to 1, 1 to 5, and 5 to 5.5.\n\nFirst, at low z, say z=0, E(z)=sqrt(0.3 + 0.7)=1. So E(0)=1. At z=1, E(z)=sqrt(0.3*(2)^3 +0.7)=sqrt(2.4+0.7)=sqrt(3.1)=1.76. At z=2, E= sqrt(0.3*(3)^3 +0.7)= sqrt(8.1+0.7)=sqrt(8.8)=2.97. At z=3, sqrt(0.3*(4)^3 +0.7)= sqrt(19.2+0.7)=sqrt(19.9)=4.46. At z=5, sqrt(0.3*(6)^3 +0.7)=sqrt(0.3*216 +0.7)= sqrt(64.8+0.7)=sqrt(65.5)=8.09. At z=5.5, sqrt(0.3*(6.5)^3 +0.7). 6.5 cubed is 274.6, 0.3*274.6=82.4, plus 0.7 gives 83.1, sqrt(83.1)=9.116.\n\nSo, to approximate the integral, let's split into intervals:\n\nLet me use the trapezoidal rule with a few intervals.\n\nFirst, let's split the integral from 0 to 5.5 into intervals:\n\n0 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 5, 5 to 5.5.\n\nCompute each interval's contribution:\n\nFirst interval 0-1:\n\nAverage E(z) at z=0 and z=1 is (1 + 1.76)/2 = 1.38.

Let me use the same approximation as before, assuming that at z=5.5, the matter term is dominant. \n\nE(z) = sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 +0.7). \n\nAt z=5.5, (1+z)=6.5. Thus, 0.3*(6.5)^3. \n\n6.5 cubed is 6.5*6.5=42.25; 42.25 *6.5= 274.625. So 0.3*274.625=82.3875. \n\nAdding 0.7 gives 83.0875. The square root of that is sqrt(83.0875)\u22489.115. \n\nBut the approximation where we ignore the dark energy term (0.7) would give sqrt(0.3*(6.5)^3)=sqrt(82.3875)=9.077. So the difference is small. \n\nProceeding with the approximation: \n\nE(z) ~sqrt(0.3)*(1+z)^(3/2). \n\nThus, the integral for D_C becomes:\n\n(c/H0) * [2/(sqrt(0.3))]* [1 -1/sqrt(1+z) ]\n\nSo with z=5.5:\n\nsqrt(1+z)=sqrt(6.5)=~2.55. \n\n1/sqrt(6.5)= ~0.392. \n\nThus, 1-0.392=0.608. \n\nThen, 2/sqrt(0.3)= same as before, ~3.651. \n\nMultiply all terms: \n\nD_C = (c/H0)*3.651 *0.608 \n\nc/H0 is 4285.7 Mpc. \n\nSo 3.651 *0.608 \u22482.22. \n\nThus, 4285.7 *2.22 \u2248 \n\n4285 *2 is 8570, 4285 *0.22 is ~942.7. \n\nTotal \u22488570+942.7=9512.7 Mpc \u22489.5 Gpc. \n\nHmm, so that's around 9.5 Gpc.

Let me start over with the correct redshift. \n\nSo the observed wavelength is 790 nm, rest is ~121.6 nm. \n\nThus, \u03bb_obs / \u03bb_rest =790 /121.6 \u22486.49 \u2192 z=6.49-1=5.49 \u2192 z\u22485.5. \n\nSo the redshift is about 5.5. \n\nNow, the question is about the comoving distance for z=5.5. \n\nSo now, redoing the calculations with z=5.5. \n\nFirst, compute the integral. Let me use the same approximation as before, assuming that at z=5.5, the matter term is dominant. \n\nE(z) = sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 +0.7). \n\nAt z=5.5, (1+z)=6.5. Thus, 0.3*(6.5)^3. \n\n6.5 cubed is 6.5*6.5=42.25; 42.25 *6.5= 274.625. So 0.3*274.625=82.3875. \n\nAdding 0.7 gives 83.0875. The square root of that is sqrt(83.0875)\u22489.115. \n\nBut the approximation where we ignore the dark energy term (0.7) would give sqrt(0.3*(6.5)^3)=sqrt(82.3875)=9.077. So the difference is small. \n\nProceeding with the approximation: \n\nE(z) ~sqrt(0.3)*(1+z)^(3/2). \n\nThus, the integral for D_C becomes:\n\n(c/H0) * [2/(sqrt(0.3))]* [1 -1/sqrt(1+z) ]\n\nSo with z=5.5:\n\nsqrt(1+z)=sqrt(6.5)=~2.55. \n\n1/sqrt(6.5)= ~0.392. \n\nThus, 1-0.392=0.608. \n\nThen, 2/sqrt(0.3)= same as before, ~3.651. \n\nMultiply all terms: \n\nD_C = (c/H0)*3.651 *0.608 \n\nc/H0 is 4285.7 Mpc. \n\nSo 3.651 *0.608 \u22482.22. \n\nThus, 4285.7 *2.22 \u2248 \n\n4285 *2 is 8570, 4285 *0.22 is ~942.7. \n\nTotal \u22488570+942.7=9512.7 Mpc \u22489.5 Gpc. \n\nHmm, so that's around 9.5 Gpc.

Let me recheck the comoving distance formula. \n\nThe comoving distance is given by:\n\nD_c = (c/H0) * \u222b\u2080^z [ 1 / sqrt(\u03a9_m (1+z')^3 + \u03a9_k (1+z')^2 + \u03a9_\u039b) ] dz'\n\nFor flat universe, \u03a9_k=0, so:\n\nD_c = (c/H0) * \u222b\u2080^z [1 / sqrt(\u03a9_m (1+z')^3 + \u03a9_\u039b) ] dz'\n\nIn our case, with \u03a9_m=0.3, \u03a9_\u039b=0.7, so the integrand is 1/sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 +0.7). \n\nSo the integral from 0 to z=7.66 of that.",
          "text2": "Wait, actually, the integral is from 0 to z of dz' divided by E(z'), multiplied by c/H0. Let me check the exact formula again. \n\nYes, the comoving distance is:\n\nD_C = (c / H\u2080) * \u222b\u2080^z [E(z')]^{-1} dz'\n\nwhere E(z) = sqrt(\u03a9_m (1+z)^3 + \u03a9_k (1+z)^2 + \u03a9_\u039b )\n\nBut since the universe is flat (\u03a9_k =0), E(z) simplifies to sqrt(\u03a9_m (1+z)^3 + \u03a9_\u039b )",
