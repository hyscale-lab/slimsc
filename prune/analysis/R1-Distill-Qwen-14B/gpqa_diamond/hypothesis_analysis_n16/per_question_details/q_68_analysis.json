When the field is turned off and then turned on along Y, the new Hamiltonian becomes H_final = -\u03bc\u00b7B' = -\u03b3 S_y B (since B is now along Y, and same magnitude as before). \n\nThe key here is that when the field direction is changed suddenly, the system is no longer in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. The initial state was an eigenstate of S_z (since it was aligned with the original B field along Z), but the new Hamiltonian depends on S_y, so the state will start evolving according to the new Hamiltonian, leading to time dependence in the expectation values of other operators, like S_z.\n\nThe question is asking for the frequency of the oscillation of the average z-component of the moment. \n\nSo, let me recall time evolution in quantum mechanics. The state will evolve according to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with the new Hamiltonian. Let's consider the initial state is |+z\u27e9, the eigenstate of S_z with +1/2 (in units where \u0127 is 1, maybe? Well, the problem states the spin is 1/2, so the eigenvalues are \u00b1\u0127/2, but maybe in the equations we can set \u0127 to 1 for simplicity, since the frequency might depend on the ratio, which would cancel out the \u0127 terms.)\n\nFirst, let's write the Hamiltonian in terms of Pauli matrices.

So we need to find \u27e8S_z\u27e9 as a function of time after the field is changed to Y, and find its oscillation frequency.\n\nThe initial state was |\u2191\u27e9_z (the eigenstate of S_z with +\u0127/2). But when we switch to the Y field, the Hamiltonian is now H_final = -\u03b3 B S_y, so the time evolution of the system will be governed by this new Hamiltonian. \n\nThe system starts in a state that is an eigenstate of S_z, but not of S_y. Therefore, the expectation value of S_z will oscillate over time. To find the frequency of these oscillations, we need to analyze the time dependence of \u27e8S_z\u27e9.\n\nLet me recall that in such scenarios, the time evolution is determined by the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian.

Let me note that \u03b3 here is the gyromagnetic ratio, so the units should be such that the Hamiltonian has units of energy. The standard form is H = -\u03b3 B \u00b7 S, so the energy eigenvalues would be -\u03b3 B times the eigenvalues of S\u00b7n, where n is the direction of the field. \n\nIn this case, after the switch, the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B S_y.

So H = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) \u03c3y. \n\nSo the Hamiltonian matrix (in units where \u0127=1, but let me see):\n\nIf we take \u0127 as part of the Hamiltonian, then H is:\n\nH = - (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) \u03c3y. \n\nThe time evolution operator is U(t) = e^{-i H t / \u0127} = e^{i (\u03b3 B / 2) \u03c3y t }.\n\nBecause substituting H into the exponent:\n\n- i H t / \u0127 = -i [ - (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) \u03c3y ] t / \u0127 = i (\u03b3 B / 2) \u03c3y t.\n\nSo U(t) = exp(i (\u03b3 B / 2) \u03c3y t )\n\nNow, we can expand this exponential. The Pauli matrices have the property that \u03c3y squared is the identity. So for any operator like \u03c3y multiplied by a scalar, the exponential can be expressed using trigonometric functions. \n\nThe general formula for exp(i \u03b8 \u03c3y) is cos(\u03b8) + i \u03c3y sin(\u03b8). Let me verify that:\n\nYes, because for a Pauli matrix, exp(i\u03b8 \u03c3y) = cos\u03b8 I + i sin\u03b8 \u03c3y. \n\nSo in this case, \u03b8 = (\u03b3 B / 2) t.\n\nTherefore, U(t) = cos( (\u03b3 B t / 2) ) I + i sin( (\u03b3 B t / 2) ) \u03c3y.\n\nNow, applying this to the initial state |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9. Let me represent |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9 as column vectors. In the standard basis:\n\n|+z\u27e9 is [1; 0], and |-z\u27e9 is [0; 1].\n\n\u03c3y is the matrix [0, -i; i, 0]. \n\nSo applying U(t) to |+z\u27e9:\n\nFirst, the identity part: cos(\u03b8) * |+z\u27e9 = cos( (\u03b3 B t/2 )) * [1;0].\n\nThe second term: i sin\u03b8 * \u03c3y |+z\u27e9.

Therefore, H = -\u03b3 B Sy = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) \u03c3y. \n\nThe Hamiltonian matrix in the Sz basis (using |+z> and |-z> as basis vectors) would be:\n\nH = - (\u03b3 B \u0127/2) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]\n\nThe eigenvalues of H can be found by solving the characteristic equation, but maybe I don't need to do that. Instead, since the system starts in |+z>, let's see how it evolves. \n\nThe time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / \u0127). Let's substitute H into that. \n\nH = - (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) \u03c3y, so H/\u0127 is - (\u03b3 B /2 ) \u03c3y.

Since S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2, the energy for |\u2191y\u27e9 is -\u03b3 B*(\u0127/2) and for |\u2193y\u27e9 is -\u03b3 B*(-\u0127/2) = + \u03b3 B \u0127/2.",
          "text2": "Wait, let's see: (i / sqrt(2)) |+y\u27e9 + ( -i / sqrt(2) ) |-y\u27e9 \n\n= (1/sqrt(2)) [ i |+y\u27e9 - i |-y\u27e9 ]\n\n= (i / sqrt(2)) ( |+y\u27e9 - |-y\u27e9 )\n\nHmm, so that's the expression. \n\nTherefore, the initial state |z+\u27e9 can be written as:\n\n|z+\u27e9 = [i (|+y\u27e9 - |-y\u27e9 ) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nSo when the Hamiltonian is turned on along Y, the time evolution will cause the state to rotate between the |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 states. \n\nThe Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B S_y, so the energy eigenvalues are for |+y\u27e9 as E_+ = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2 ), and E_- = \u03b3 B (\u0127/2 ), since S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1\u0127/2. \n\nThe time evolution of the state is:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = U(t)|z+\u27e9 = e^{-i H t / \u0127 } |z+\u27e9 \n\nSubstituting H:\n\nU(t) = e^{i \u03b3 B S_y t / \u0127 } \n\nBecause H = -\u03b3 B S_y, so -H/\u0127 = \u03b3 B S_y / \u0127. So the exponent is (\u03b3 B S_y t)/\u0127. \n\nSo the state becomes:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = e^{i \u03b3 B S_y t / \u0127 } [ (i |+y\u27e9 - i |-y\u27e9 ) / sqrt(2) ]\n\nSince S_y |\u00b1y\u27e9 = \u00b1 (\u0127/2) |\u00b1y\u27e9, the operator e^{i \u03b3 B S_y t / \u0127 } acts on |+y\u27e9 as multiplying by e^{i \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) t / \u0127 } = e^{i \u03b3 B t / 2 }, and similarly for |-y\u27e9 but with the opposite sign. \n\nTherefore:\n\ne^{i \u03b3 B S_y t / \u0127 } |+y\u27e9 = e^{i \u03b3 B (\u0127/2)/\u0127 t } |+y\u27e9 = e^{i \u03b3 B t / 2 } |+y\u27e9 \n\nSimilarly, e^{i \u03b3 B S_y t / \u0127 } |-y\u27e9 = e^{ -i \u03b3 B t / 2 } |-y\u27e9 \n\nPutting it all into the state:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = 1/sqrt(2) [ i e^{i \u03b3 B t/2 } |+y\u27e9 - i e^{ -i \u03b3 B t/2 } |-y\u27e9 ]\n\nNow, we need to compute the expectation value of S_z at time t. The magnetic moment's z-component is \u03bc_z = \u03b3 S_z, so the average \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 = \u03b3 \u27e8S_z\u27e9. \n\nSo first compute \u27e8\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.

So the oscillation frequency (in Hz) is \u03c9/(2\u03c0) = (\u03b3 B)/(2\u03c0). But the problem is asking for the frequency, but all options are in terms of gamma*B. So perhaps they are referring to the angular frequency. Let's see the question again.\n\nThe question says: \"the average of the z-component of the particle\u2019s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?\"\n\nHmm, the term \"frequency\" can sometimes refer to angular frequency in physics contexts, but sometimes not. Let me see the options. The options include B) gamma*B. Since in the equation, the cosine term has an argument of (gamma B) t. So the angular frequency is gamma*B, so if the question is asking for angular frequency, then the answer would be B). But if it's asking for the regular frequency (cycles per second), then it would be divided by 2pi. Since the options are given without 2pi factors, I think they are referring to the angular frequency here.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B) gamma*B.",

Let's consider the time evolution. The initial state is |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9. The time evolution is given by |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = e^{-iHt/\u0127} |\u03c8(0)\u27e9. \n\nLet me compute H in matrix form.

Let's consider the time evolution. The initial state is |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9. The time evolution is given by |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = e^{-iHt/\u0127} |\u03c8(0)\u27e9. \n\nLet me compute H in matrix form. Let's set \u0127 to 1 for simplicity (since we can track the units, but maybe I'll keep it explicit). \n\nH = -\u03b3 B Sy. \n\nSy in terms of Pauli matrices is (\u0127/2) \u03c3y.

The Pauli matrices have the property that \u03c3y squared is the identity. So for any operator like \u03c3y multiplied by a scalar, the exponential can be expressed using trigonometric functions. \n\nThe general formula for exp(i \u03b8 \u03c3y) is cos(\u03b8) + i \u03c3y sin(\u03b8).

So for any operator like \u03c3y multiplied by a scalar, the exponential can be expressed using trigonometric functions. \n\nThe general formula for exp(i \u03b8 \u03c3y) is cos(\u03b8) + i \u03c3y sin(\u03b8). Let me verify that:\n\nYes, because for a Pauli matrix, exp(i\u03b8 \u03c3y) = cos\u03b8 I + i sin\u03b8 \u03c3y. \n\nSo in this case, \u03b8 = (\u03b3 B / 2) t.\n\nTherefore, U(t) = cos( (\u03b3 B t / 2) ) I + i sin( (\u03b3 B t / 2) ) \u03c3y.\n\nNow, applying this to the initial state |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9. Let me represent |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9 as column vectors. In the standard basis:\n\n|+z\u27e9 is [1; 0], and |-z\u27e9 is [0; 1].\n\n\u03c3y is the matrix [0, -i; i, 0]. \n\nSo applying U(t) to |+z\u27e9:\n\nFirst, the identity part: cos(\u03b8) * |+z\u27e9 = cos( (\u03b3 B t/2 )) * [1;0].\n\nThe second term: i sin\u03b8 * \u03c3y |+z\u27e9.

          "text1": "Wait, the problem says \"mu (= gamma*Sz)\", so maybe the entire magnetic moment is along the z-component. That would be strange unless the spin is aligned along z. But when the field is turned to Y, the interaction would involve the y-component of the magnetic moment. Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering that the magnetic moment's z-component is gamma Sz, but the total moment is still a vector. Maybe the question is only concerned with the z-component of the moment's time evolution even when the field is along Y.\n\nLet me re-read the question: \"The average of the z-component of the particle\u2019s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?\" So the problem is about how the expectation value of \u03bc_z evolves over time after the magnetic field is switched to Y. \n\nSo let's set up the problem more formally. Let's consider the initial state is |+z\u27e9, since the particle is aligned with the initial B field in the z-direction. Then, when we turn off the z-B field and turn on a Y-B field of the same magnitude, the new Hamiltonian will be H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. But \u03bc is the magnetic moment. Since \u03bc = \u03b3 S (the full vector), the Hamiltonian becomes H = -\u03b3 S\u00b7B. Since B is along Y, this becomes H = -\u03b3 S_y B. Because S\u00b7B would be S_y B in this case (since B is in Y direction).\n\nThe Hamiltonian in terms of operators can be written as H = -\u03b3 B S_y. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of S_y would be needed here. But since the initial state is |+z\u27e9, which is an eigenstate of S_z, not S_y, the system will start evolving according to the new Hamiltonian, leading to time dependence in the expectation values.\n\nThe question is about the oscillation frequency of \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9. Since \u03bc_z = \u03b3 S_z, the expectation value \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 is \u03b3 \u27e8S_z\u27e9. Therefore, we can focus on finding the time dependence of \u27e8S_z\u27e9 and then multiply by \u03b3 to get the frequency of the oscillation.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the oscillation frequency of \u27e8S_z\u27e9 when the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B S_y, starting from the initial state |+z\u27e9.\n\nTo solve this, let's recall that the time evolution of an operator in the Heisenberg picture, or using the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the state vector. Let me proceed with the Schr\u00f6dinger picture.\n\nThe initial state at time t=0 is |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9. The Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B S_y. Let's write the S_y operator in terms of Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices for spin-1/2 are:\n\nS_x = \u0127/2 \u03c3_x, S_y = \u0127/2 \u03c3_y, S_z = \u0127/2 \u03c3_z.\n\nBut since the constants might be absorbed into \u03b3, perhaps we can set \u0127=1 for simplicity here, since the frequency will involve \u03b3 B.",

But when B is turned off and turned on along Y, the new Hamiltonian would be H = -\u03bc\u00b7B' where B' is along Y. \n\nBut the key here is that when the field is changed, the system will start to precess around the new field direction. The question is about the z-component of the magnetic moment's average, which starts oscillating. \n\nSince the particle was initially in the +Sz state. Let me recall that when the magnetic field direction changes, the basis states also change. The new basis is along Y. But the initial state is in the Z basis. So we need to express the initial state in terms of the Y basis states. \n\nThe spin states in the Y direction can be found using the standard spin-1/2 basis transformations. The eigenstates of Sy are |+y> and |-y>.

So the eigenvector is (|+z\u27e9 -i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2. \n\nOkay, so that gives the eigenstates. \n\nNow, going back to the problem. The initial state is |+z\u27e9.

The time evolution under H will cause the state to oscillate between these two states, but because H is proportional to Sy, the off-diagonal terms in the Sz basis will lead to transitions between |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9. \n\nThe key is to find the time dependence of \u27e8Sz\u27e9. Let's consider the time evolution. The initial state is |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9. The time evolution is given by |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = e^{-iHt/\u0127} |\u03c8(0)\u27e9. \n\nLet me compute H in matrix form. Let's set \u0127 to 1 for simplicity (since we can track the units, but maybe I'll keep it explicit). \n\nH = -\u03b3 B Sy. \n\nSy in terms of Pauli matrices is (\u0127/2) \u03c3y. So H = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) \u03c3y. \n\nSo the Hamiltonian matrix (in units where \u0127=1, but let me see):\n\nIf we take \u0127 as part of the Hamiltonian, then H is:\n\nH = - (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) \u03c3y. \n\nThe time evolution operator is U(t) = e^{-i H t / \u0127} = e^{i (\u03b3 B / 2) \u03c3y t }.\n\nBecause substituting H into the exponent:\n\n- i H t / \u0127 = -i [ - (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) \u03c3y ] t / \u0127 = i (\u03b3 B / 2) \u03c3y t.\n\nSo U(t) = exp(i (\u03b3 B / 2) \u03c3y t )\n\nNow, we can expand this exponential. The Pauli matrices have the property that \u03c3y squared is the identity. So for any operator like \u03c3y multiplied by a scalar, the exponential can be expressed using trigonometric functions. \n\nThe general formula for exp(i \u03b8 \u03c3y) is cos(\u03b8) + i \u03c3y sin(\u03b8). Let me verify that:\n\nYes, because for a Pauli matrix, exp(i\u03b8 \u03c3y) = cos\u03b8 I + i sin\u03b8 \u03c3y. \n\nSo in this case, \u03b8 = (\u03b3 B / 2) t.\n\nTherefore, U(t) = cos( (\u03b3 B t / 2) ) I + i sin( (\u03b3 B t / 2) ) \u03c3y.\n\nNow, applying this to the initial state |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9.

But when the field is turned to Y, the interaction would involve the y-component of the magnetic moment. Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering that the magnetic moment's z-component is gamma Sz, but the total moment is still a vector. Maybe the question is only concerned with the z-component of the moment's time evolution even when the field is along Y.\n\nLet me re-read the question: \"The average of the z-component of the particle\u2019s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?\" So the problem is about how the expectation value of \u03bc_z evolves over time after the magnetic field is switched to Y. \n\nSo let's set up the problem more formally. Let's consider the initial state is |+z\u27e9, since the particle is aligned with the initial B field in the z-direction. Then, when we turn off the z-B field and turn on a Y-B field of the same magnitude, the new Hamiltonian will be H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. But \u03bc is the magnetic moment. Since \u03bc = \u03b3 S (the full vector), the Hamiltonian becomes H = -\u03b3 S\u00b7B. Since B is along Y, this becomes H = -\u03b3 S_y B. Because S\u00b7B would be S_y B in this case (since B is in Y direction).\n\nThe Hamiltonian in terms of operators can be written as H = -\u03b3 B S_y. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of S_y would be needed here. But since the initial state is |+z\u27e9, which is an eigenstate of S_z, not S_y, the system will start evolving according to the new Hamiltonian, leading to time dependence in the expectation values.\n\nThe question is about the oscillation frequency of \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9. Since \u03bc_z = \u03b3 S_z, the expectation value \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 is \u03b3 \u27e8S_z\u27e9. Therefore, we can focus on finding the time dependence of \u27e8S_z\u27e9 and then multiply by \u03b3 to get the frequency of the oscillation.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the oscillation frequency of \u27e8S_z\u27e9 when the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B S_y, starting from the initial state |+z\u27e9.\n\nTo solve this, let's recall that the time evolution of an operator in the Heisenberg picture, or using the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the state vector.

The time evolution under H will cause the state to oscillate between these two states, but because H is proportional to Sy, the off-diagonal terms in the Sz basis will lead to transitions between |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9. \n\nThe key is to find the time dependence of \u27e8Sz\u27e9. Let's consider the time evolution. The initial state is |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9. The time evolution is given by |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = e^{-iHt/\u0127} |\u03c8(0)\u27e9. \n\nLet me compute H in matrix form. Let's set \u0127 to 1 for simplicity (since we can track the units, but maybe I'll keep it explicit). \n\nH = -\u03b3 B Sy. \n\nSy in terms of Pauli matrices is (\u0127/2) \u03c3y.

What is its oscillation frequency?\" So the problem is about how the expectation value of \u03bc_z evolves over time after the magnetic field is switched to Y. \n\nSo let's set up the problem more formally. Let's consider the initial state is |+z\u27e9, since the particle is aligned with the initial B field in the z-direction. Then, when we turn off the z-B field and turn on a Y-B field of the same magnitude, the new Hamiltonian will be H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. But \u03bc is the magnetic moment.

So the oscillation frequency (in Hz) is \u03c9/(2\u03c0) = (\u03b3 B)/(2\u03c0). But the problem is asking for the frequency, but all options are in terms of gamma*B. So perhaps they are referring to the angular frequency. Let's see the question again.\n\nThe question says: \"the average of the z-component of the particle\u2019s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?\"\n\nHmm, the term \"frequency\" can sometimes refer to angular frequency in physics contexts, but sometimes not. Let me see the options. The options include B) gamma*B. Since in the equation, the cosine term has an argument of (gamma B) t. So the angular frequency is gamma*B, so if the question is asking for angular frequency, then the answer would be B). But if it's asking for the regular frequency (cycles per second), then it would be divided by 2pi. Since the options are given without 2pi factors, I think they are referring to the angular frequency here.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B) gamma*B.",

Let's consider the time evolution. The initial state is |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9. The time evolution is given by |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = e^{-iHt/\u0127} |\u03c8(0)\u27e9. \n\nLet me compute H in matrix form.

Let's consider the time evolution. The initial state is |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9. The time evolution is given by |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = e^{-iHt/\u0127} |\u03c8(0)\u27e9. \n\nLet me compute H in matrix form. Let's set \u0127 to 1 for simplicity (since we can track the units, but maybe I'll keep it explicit). \n\nH = -\u03b3 B Sy. \n\nSy in terms of Pauli matrices is (\u0127/2) \u03c3y.

The Pauli matrices have the property that \u03c3y squared is the identity. So for any operator like \u03c3y multiplied by a scalar, the exponential can be expressed using trigonometric functions. \n\nThe general formula for exp(i \u03b8 \u03c3y) is cos(\u03b8) + i \u03c3y sin(\u03b8).

What is its oscillation frequency?\"\n\nHmm, the term \"frequency\" can sometimes refer to angular frequency in physics contexts, but sometimes not. Let me see the options. The options include B) gamma*B. Since in the equation, the cosine term has an argument of (gamma B) t. So the angular frequency is gamma*B, so if the question is asking for angular frequency, then the answer would be B). But if it's asking for the regular frequency (cycles per second), then it would be divided by 2pi. Since the options are given without 2pi factors, I think they are referring to the angular frequency here.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B) gamma*B.",
          "text2": "Wait, because the argument of the cosine is \u03b3 B t, so the angular frequency \u03c9 is \u03b3 B.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is f = \u03c9/(2\u03c0) = (\u03b3 B)/(2\u03c0), but the question asks for the oscillation frequency. Since in physics, when they refer to frequency here, they might mean the angular frequency. Because in quantum mechanics, when dealing with oscillations like this, the frequency in the exponent is the angular frequency. Let me check the question again.\n\nThe question says \"the average of the z-component of the particle\u2019s moment starts oscillating.

Let's consider the time evolution. The initial state is |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9. The time evolution is given by |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = e^{-iHt/\u0127} |\u03c8(0)\u27e9. \n\nLet me compute H in matrix form.

Let's set \u0127 to 1 for simplicity (since we can track the units, but maybe I'll keep it explicit). \n\nH = -\u03b3 B Sy. \n\nSy in terms of Pauli matrices is (\u0127/2) \u03c3y. So H = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) \u03c3y. \n\nSo the Hamiltonian matrix (in units where \u0127=1, but let me see):\n\nIf we take \u0127 as part of the Hamiltonian, then H is:\n\nH = - (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) \u03c3y. \n\nThe time evolution operator is U(t) = e^{-i H t / \u0127} = e^{i (\u03b3 B / 2) \u03c3y t }.\n\nBecause substituting H into the exponent:\n\n- i H t / \u0127 = -i [ - (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) \u03c3y ] t / \u0127 = i (\u03b3 B / 2) \u03c3y t.\n\nSo U(t) = exp(i (\u03b3 B / 2) \u03c3y t )\n\nNow, we can expand this exponential. The Pauli matrices have the property that \u03c3y squared is the identity. So for any operator like \u03c3y multiplied by a scalar, the exponential can be expressed using trigonometric functions. \n\nThe general formula for exp(i \u03b8 \u03c3y) is cos(\u03b8) + i \u03c3y sin(\u03b8). Let me verify that:\n\nYes, because for a Pauli matrix, exp(i\u03b8 \u03c3y) = cos\u03b8 I + i sin\u03b8 \u03c3y. \n\nSo in this case, \u03b8 = (\u03b3 B / 2) t.\n\nTherefore, U(t) = cos( (\u03b3 B t / 2) ) I + i sin( (\u03b3 B t / 2) ) \u03c3y.\n\nNow, applying this to the initial state |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9. Let me represent |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9 as column vectors. In the standard basis:\n\n|+z\u27e9 is [1; 0], and |-z\u27e9 is [0; 1].\n\n\u03c3y is the matrix [0, -i; i, 0]. \n\nSo applying U(t) to |+z\u27e9:\n\nFirst, the identity part: cos(\u03b8) * |+z\u27e9 = cos( (\u03b3 B t/2 )) * [1;0].\n\nThe second term: i sin\u03b8 * \u03c3y |+z\u27e9. Let's compute \u03c3y times |+z\u27e9:\n\n\u03c3y * [1;0] = [0; i*1], since the second component is i times the first component?",

Therefore, H = -\u03b3 B Sy = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) \u03c3y. \n\nThe Hamiltonian matrix in the Sz basis (using |+z> and |-z> as basis vectors) would be:\n\nH = - (\u03b3 B \u0127/2) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]\n\nThe eigenvalues of H can be found by solving the characteristic equation, but maybe I don't need to do that. Instead, since the system starts in |+z>, let's see how it evolves. \n\nThe time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / \u0127). Let's substitute H into that. \n\nH = - (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) \u03c3y, so H/\u0127 is - (\u03b3 B /2 ) \u03c3y.

So we need to express the initial state in terms of the Y basis states. \n\nThe spin states in the Y direction can be found using the standard spin-1/2 basis transformations. The eigenstates of Sy are |+y> and |-y>. The initial state |+z> can be expressed as a combination of |+y> and |-y>. \n\nLet me recall that in quantum mechanics, the eigenstates of S_z are related to those of S_y via rotation. The transformation matrix between them involves a rotation of \u03c0/2 around the X axis, perhaps. \n\nThe states can be written as:\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/\u221a2\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/\u221a2",

Since S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2, the energy for |\u2191y\u27e9 is -\u03b3 B*(\u0127/2) and for |\u2193y\u27e9 is -\u03b3 B*(-\u0127/2) = + \u03b3 B \u0127/2.",

So the exponent is (\u03b3 B S_y t)/\u0127. \n\nSo the state becomes:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = e^{i \u03b3 B S_y t / \u0127 } [ (i |+y\u27e9 - i |-y\u27e9 ) / sqrt(2) ]\n\nSince S_y |\u00b1y\u27e9 = \u00b1 (\u0127/2) |\u00b1y\u27e9, the operator e^{i \u03b3 B S_y t / \u0127 } acts on |+y\u27e9 as multiplying by e^{i \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) t / \u0127 } = e^{i \u03b3 B t / 2 }, and similarly for |-y\u27e9 but with the opposite sign. \n\nTherefore:\n\ne^{i \u03b3 B S_y t / \u0127 } |+y\u27e9 = e^{i \u03b3 B (\u0127/2)/\u0127 t } |+y\u27e9 = e^{i \u03b3 B t / 2 } |+y\u27e9 \n\nSimilarly, e^{i \u03b3 B S_y t / \u0127 } |-y\u27e9 = e^{ -i \u03b3 B t / 2 } |-y\u27e9 \n\nPutting it all into the state:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = 1/sqrt(2) [ i e^{i \u03b3 B t/2 } |+y\u27e9 - i e^{ -i \u03b3 B t/2 } |-y\u27e9 ]\n\nNow, we need to compute the expectation value of S_z at time t. The magnetic moment's z-component is \u03bc_z = \u03b3 S_z, so the average \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 = \u03b3 \u27e8S_z\u27e9. \n\nSo first compute \u27e8\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.

The time evolution under H will cause the state to oscillate between these two states, but because H is proportional to Sy, the off-diagonal terms in the Sz basis will lead to transitions between |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9. \n\nThe key is to find the time dependence of \u27e8Sz\u27e9. Let's consider the time evolution. The initial state is |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9. The time evolution is given by |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = e^{-iHt/\u0127} |\u03c8(0)\u27e9. \n\nLet me compute H in matrix form. Let's set \u0127 to 1 for simplicity (since we can track the units, but maybe I'll keep it explicit). \n\nH = -\u03b3 B Sy. \n\nSy in terms of Pauli matrices is (\u0127/2) \u03c3y.

The Pauli matrices have the property that \u03c3y squared is the identity. So for any operator like \u03c3y multiplied by a scalar, the exponential can be expressed using trigonometric functions. \n\nThe general formula for exp(i \u03b8 \u03c3y) is cos(\u03b8) + i \u03c3y sin(\u03b8). Let me verify that:\n\nYes, because for a Pauli matrix, exp(i\u03b8 \u03c3y) = cos\u03b8 I + i sin\u03b8 \u03c3y. \n\nSo in this case, \u03b8 = (\u03b3 B / 2) t.\n\nTherefore, U(t) = cos( (\u03b3 B t / 2) ) I + i sin( (\u03b3 B t / 2) ) \u03c3y.\n\nNow, applying this to the initial state |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9.

So H = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) \u03c3y. \n\nSo the Hamiltonian matrix (in units where \u0127=1, but let me see):\n\nIf we take \u0127 as part of the Hamiltonian, then H is:\n\nH = - (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) \u03c3y. \n\nThe time evolution operator is U(t) = e^{-i H t / \u0127} = e^{i (\u03b3 B / 2) \u03c3y t }.\n\nBecause substituting H into the exponent:\n\n- i H t / \u0127 = -i [ - (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) \u03c3y ] t / \u0127 = i (\u03b3 B / 2) \u03c3y t.\n\nSo U(t) = exp(i (\u03b3 B / 2) \u03c3y t )\n\nNow, we can expand this exponential. The Pauli matrices have the property that \u03c3y squared is the identity. So for any operator like \u03c3y multiplied by a scalar, the exponential can be expressed using trigonometric functions. \n\nThe general formula for exp(i \u03b8 \u03c3y) is cos(\u03b8) + i \u03c3y sin(\u03b8). Let me verify that:\n\nYes, because for a Pauli matrix, exp(i\u03b8 \u03c3y) = cos\u03b8 I + i sin\u03b8 \u03c3y. \n\nSo in this case, \u03b8 = (\u03b3 B / 2) t.\n\nTherefore, U(t) = cos( (\u03b3 B t / 2) ) I + i sin( (\u03b3 B t / 2) ) \u03c3y.\n\nNow, applying this to the initial state |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9. Let me represent |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9 as column vectors. In the standard basis:\n\n|+z\u27e9 is [1; 0], and |-z\u27e9 is [0; 1].\n\n\u03c3y is the matrix [0, -i; i, 0]. \n\nSo applying U(t) to |+z\u27e9:\n\nFirst, the identity part: cos(\u03b8) * |+z\u27e9 = cos( (\u03b3 B t/2 )) * [1;0].\n\nThe second term: i sin\u03b8 * \u03c3y |+z\u27e9. Let's compute \u03c3y times |+z\u27e9:\n\n\u03c3y * [1;0] = [0; i*1], since the second component is i times the first component?",

Let me think. \n\nThe initial state is |+z\u27e9, the eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue +\u0127/2. When the magnetic field is turned to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -\u03bc\u00b7B_y = -\u03b3 B S_y.

So we need to find \u27e8S_z\u27e9 as a function of time and find its oscillation frequency. \n\nTo find \u27e8S_z\u27e9(t), we can express the time evolution in the basis of the new Hamiltonian. Since H is proportional to S_y, the eigenstates of S_y are the appropriate basis here. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9.

          "text1": "Wait, the problem says \"mu (= gamma*Sz)\", so maybe the entire magnetic moment is along the z-component. That would be strange unless the spin is aligned along z. But when the field is turned to Y, the interaction would involve the y-component of the magnetic moment. Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering that the magnetic moment's z-component is gamma Sz, but the total moment is still a vector. Maybe the question is only concerned with the z-component of the moment's time evolution even when the field is along Y.\n\nLet me re-read the question: \"The average of the z-component of the particle\u2019s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?\" So the problem is about how the expectation value of \u03bc_z evolves over time after the magnetic field is switched to Y. \n\nSo let's set up the problem more formally. Let's consider the initial state is |+z\u27e9, since the particle is aligned with the initial B field in the z-direction. Then, when we turn off the z-B field and turn on a Y-B field of the same magnitude, the new Hamiltonian will be H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. But \u03bc is the magnetic moment. Since \u03bc = \u03b3 S (the full vector), the Hamiltonian becomes H = -\u03b3 S\u00b7B. Since B is along Y, this becomes H = -\u03b3 S_y B. Because S\u00b7B would be S_y B in this case (since B is in Y direction).\n\nThe Hamiltonian in terms of operators can be written as H = -\u03b3 B S_y. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of S_y would be needed here. But since the initial state is |+z\u27e9, which is an eigenstate of S_z, not S_y, the system will start evolving according to the new Hamiltonian, leading to time dependence in the expectation values.\n\nThe question is about the oscillation frequency of \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9. Since \u03bc_z = \u03b3 S_z, the expectation value \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 is \u03b3 \u27e8S_z\u27e9. Therefore, we can focus on finding the time dependence of \u27e8S_z\u27e9 and then multiply by \u03b3 to get the frequency of the oscillation.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the oscillation frequency of \u27e8S_z\u27e9 when the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B S_y, starting from the initial state |+z\u27e9.\n\nTo solve this, let's recall that the time evolution of an operator in the Heisenberg picture, or using the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the state vector. Let me proceed with the Schr\u00f6dinger picture.\n\nThe initial state at time t=0 is |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9. The Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B S_y. Let's write the S_y operator in terms of Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices for spin-1/2 are:\n\nS_x = \u0127/2 \u03c3_x, S_y = \u0127/2 \u03c3_y, S_z = \u0127/2 \u03c3_z.\n\nBut since the constants might be absorbed into \u03b3, perhaps we can set \u0127=1 for simplicity here, since the frequency will involve \u03b3 B.",

The question is about the z-component of the magnetic moment's average, which starts oscillating. \n\nSince the particle was initially in the +Sz state. Let me recall that when the magnetic field direction changes, the basis states also change. The new basis is along Y. But the initial state is in the Z basis.

So the exponent becomes -i ( - (gamma B / 2 ) \u03c3y ) t = i (gamma B t / 2 ) \u03c3y.\n\nSo U(t) = exp( i (gamma B t / 2 ) \u03c3y )\n\nThe Pauli matrices have the property that \u03c3y squared is 1, so the exponential can be expanded as:\n\nexp(i \u03b8 \u03c3y ) = cos\u03b8 I + i \u03c3y sin\u03b8, where \u03b8 = (gamma B t / 2 )\n\nTherefore, U(t) = cos( gamma B t / 2 ) I + i \u03c3y sin( gamma B t / 2 )\n\nNow, the initial state is |\u2191z\u27e9 = [1; 0].\n\nLet me apply U(t) to this state.\n\nFirst, writing U(t) as:\n\nU(t) = [ cos(\u03b8)   i sin\u03b8 ]\n       [ i sin\u03b8    cos\u03b8 ]",

Instead, since the system starts in |+z>, let's see how it evolves. \n\nThe time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / \u0127). Let's substitute H into that. \n\nH = - (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) \u03c3y, so H/\u0127 is - (\u03b3 B /2 ) \u03c3y. Therefore, the exponent is -i * (-\u03b3 B /2 \u03c3y ) * t. \n\nSo U(t) = exp( i (\u03b3 B t / 2 ) \u03c3y )\n\nNow, the state at time t is |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = U(t) |+z\u27e9. \n\nWe can represent |+z\u27e9 as a column vector [1; 0]. \n\nLet me compute U(t) acting on this vector. \n\nFirst, \u03c3y is the Pauli Y matrix. The exponential of i times (\u03b3 B t / 2 ) \u03c3y. Hmm, exponentials of Pauli matrices can be expressed using Euler's formula for spin matrices. \n\nRecall that for any Pauli matrix \u03c3, exp(i \u03b8 \u03c3) = cos\u03b8 I + i sin\u03b8 \u03c3.",

But when the field is turned to Y, the interaction would involve the y-component of the magnetic moment. Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering that the magnetic moment's z-component is gamma Sz, but the total moment is still a vector. Maybe the question is only concerned with the z-component of the moment's time evolution even when the field is along Y.\n\nLet me re-read the question: \"The average of the z-component of the particle\u2019s moment starts oscillating.

Then, when we turn off the z-B field and turn on a Y-B field of the same magnitude, the new Hamiltonian will be H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. But \u03bc is the magnetic moment.

The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of S_y would be needed here. But since the initial state is |+z\u27e9, which is an eigenstate of S_z, not S_y, the system will start evolving according to the new Hamiltonian, leading to time dependence in the expectation values.\n\nThe question is about the oscillation frequency of \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9. Since \u03bc_z = \u03b3 S_z, the expectation value \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 is \u03b3 \u27e8S_z\u27e9. Therefore, we can focus on finding the time dependence of \u27e8S_z\u27e9 and then multiply by \u03b3 to get the frequency of the oscillation.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the oscillation frequency of \u27e8S_z\u27e9 when the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B S_y, starting from the initial state |+z\u27e9.\n\nTo solve this, let's recall that the time evolution of an operator in the Heisenberg picture, or using the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the state vector.

So that's the correct decomposition. \n\nSo |+z\u27e9 = (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2 \n\nTherefore, the initial state can be written as a combination of the eigenstates of \u03c3_y (which are the eigenstates of H). \n\nThe time evolution of the state |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is then:\n\nU(t) |+z\u27e9 = U(t) [ (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2 ]\n\nSince |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 are eigenstates of \u03c3_y, and H is proportional to \u03c3_y, the time evolution operator applied to these is straightforward. \n\nThe eigenvalues of \u03c3_y for |+y\u27e9 is +1, so the energy eigenvalue for H is:\n\nFor |+y\u27e9, H = - (gamma B \u0127 /2 ) * 1 \u2192 so the energy is E_+ = - (gamma B \u0127)/2 \n\nSimilarly, for |-y\u27e9, the eigenvalue of \u03c3_y is -1, so H energy is E_- = - (gamma B \u0127 /2)(-1) = (gamma B \u0127)/2 \n\nTherefore, the time evolution of each term is:\n\nU(t)|+y\u27e9 = exp( -i E_+ t / \u0127 ) |+y\u27e9 = exp( -i (- gamma B \u0127/2 ) t / \u0127 ) |+y\u27e9 \n\n= exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y\u27e9 \n\nSimilarly, U(t)|-y\u27e9 = exp( -i E_- t / \u0127 ) |-y\u27e9 \n\n= exp( -i (gamma B \u0127 /2 ) t / \u0127 ) |-y\u27e9 \n\n= exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |-y\u27e9 \n\nThus, putting it all together:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)[ exp(i gamma B t/2 ) |+y\u27e9 + exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) |-y\u27e9 ]\n\nNow, to compute \u27e8Sz\u27e9, which is \u27e8\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)\u27e9. \n\nSince Sz is (\u0127/2) \u03c3_z. The expectation value is (\u0127/2) \u27e8\u03c8(t)| \u03c3_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9. But since the question is about the magnetic moment's z-component, which is \u03bc_z = gamma Sz. So the average of \u03bc_z is gamma \u27e8Sz\u27e9. But since the options are in terms of gamma*B, perhaps the \u0127 will cancel out. Let me see.",
