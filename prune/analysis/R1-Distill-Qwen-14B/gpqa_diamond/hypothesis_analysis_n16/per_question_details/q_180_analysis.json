How can I compute the sum of all mutual potential energies?\n\nEach of the 12 charges contributes a pair with each of the other 11. So total of (12 choose 2) = 66 pairs.\n\nIf I assume that each pair is at a distance r from each other, but I don't know r. So perhaps the problem is considering that each pair of the 12 is at a distance of 2 m from each other, but that's impossible.",

Or perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12, but not the mutual energies between the 12.\n\nBut I think the correct approach is to include all the interactions. So, I need to compute all possible pairs.\n\nLet me try to break this down.\n\nThe system consists of 13 charges: one fixed at P, and 12 on a sphere of radius 2m around P.\n\nThe total potential energy U is the sum over all pairs:\n\nU = sum_{i < j} [ k * q_i q_j / r_ij ]\n\nWhere r_ij is the distance between charges i and j.\n\nSo, in this system, there are two types of pairs:\n\n1. The central charge (q=2e) with each of the 12 surrounding charges (each q=2e) at a distance of 2m.\n\n2. Each pair among the 12 surrounding charges. The distance between any two surrounding charges depends on their positions on the sphere.\n\nSo, if all 12 are equally spaced on the sphere, the distance between any two would be the same. But for the sake of this problem, perhaps an assumption is made that their mutual distances are 2m as well. But that would only be the case if all charges are at the same point, which isn't possible because they are constrained to 2m from P.",

Let me try that.\n\nEach of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from the fixed charge. The potential energy between each pair is U = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2 m). So each contributes k*(4e\u00b2)/(2) = 2k e\u00b2. Since there are 12 such pairs, the total would be 12 * 2k e\u00b2 = 24 k e\u00b2.",
