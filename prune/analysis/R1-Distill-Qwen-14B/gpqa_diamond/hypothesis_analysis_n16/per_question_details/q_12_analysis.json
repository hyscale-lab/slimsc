Let me try to set up the equation properly.\n\nLet me denote m_\u03c0 = 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2, m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2. The neutrino mass is neglected, so m_nu \u2248 0.\n\nTotal energy conservation:\n\nm_\u03c0 c\u00b2 = E_mu + E_nu\n\nMomentum conservation: since initial momentum is zero, p_mu + p_nu = 0.

Let me set variables in terms of energy. Let me let x = p c (so units of energy, since p c has units of energy, like MeV). Then the equation becomes:\n\nm_\u03c0 = sqrt( x\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 ) + x",

Because E_nu squared equals (0)^2 + p_nu squared, so E_nu = p_nu.\n\nSo from momentum conservation, p_mu = p_nu = E_nu.\n\nLet me write the equations again:\n\nE_mu = sqrt(m_mu^2 + p_mu^2) = sqrt(105.7\u00b2 + p_mu\u00b2)\n\nE_nu = p_nu = p_mu (since p_mu = p_nu)\n\nSo, the total energy equation is:\n\nsqrt(105.7\u00b2 + p_mu\u00b2) + p_mu = 139.6\n\nHmm, so I need to solve for p_mu here.\n\nLet me denote p_mu as x for simplicity.

Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, 29.78 squared is approximately (30)^2 =900 minus (0.22)^2 and cross terms. But let's compute exactly:\n\n29.78^2 = (29 +0.78)^2 = 29\u00b2 + 2*29*0.78 + 0.78\u00b2 = 841 + 45.24 + 0.6084 \u2248 841 +45.24 = 886.24 +0.6084\u2248886.85.\n\nThen m_mu squared: 105.7^2 = (100 +5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49.\n\nSo adding p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 = 886.85 + 11172.49 = 12059.34. Take the square root: sqrt(12059.34) \u2248 let's see. 110^2 is 12100, which is a bit higher. So sqrt(12059.34) \u2248 109.8 (since 109.8^2 = (110 -0.2)^2 = 12100 -44 +0.04= 12056.04. Hmm, that's very close. So sqrt(12059.34) is about 109.8 + (12059.34 -12056.04)/ (2*109.8) \u2248 109.8 + ~3.3/219.6 \u2248 ~109.815. So approximately 109.8 MeV.\n\nTherefore, the muon's energy E_mu \u2248109.8 MeV. Then its kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 MeV. \n\nThe neutrino's energy is E_nu = p =29.78 MeV. Since the neutrino's rest mass is zero, all its energy is kinetic, so KE_nu =29.78 MeV.",

The square root of that is the muon's energy. \n\nTake sqrt(12059.34). Let's see, sqrt(12059). Let me think: 110\u00b2 is 12100, so sqrt(12059) is a bit less than 110. \n\n110^2 =12100. So 12059 is 12100-41. So sqrt(12059) \u2248 110 - (41)/(2*110) \u2248110 -0.186 \u2248109.814 MeV.",

So:\n\nE_mu = sqrt( p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2 )\n\nE_nu = p \n\nSo total energy equation:\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2) + p = 139.6 \n\nWhich is exactly the equation I had before. \n\nSo solving that gives p \u224829.78 MeV/c (since in natural units, c=1, so p is in MeV/c, but when multiplied by c, that gives MeV for energy terms). \n\nSo the neutrino's energy is p \u224829.78 MeV. \n\nThe muon's energy is sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ). Let me calculate that. \n\nFirst, (29.78)^2 \u2248 886.8 \n\n(105.7)^2 = 11172.49 \n\nAdding those gives 11172.49 +886.8 \u2248 12059.29 \n\nTaking the square root: sqrt(12059.29). Let's see, sqrt(12059) is about 109.8. Because 110^2 is 12100, so sqrt(12059) is a bit less, like 109.8. Let me check 109.8 squared: 109^2 is 11881, 0.8 squared is 0.64, cross term 2*109*0.8=174.4. So 109.8^2 = (109 +0.8)^2 = 109\u00b2 + 2*109*0.8 +0.8\u00b2 = 11881 + 174.4 +0.64 = 12056.04. Close to 12059.29. \n\nSo sqrt(12059.29) \u2248109.8 (since the difference is about 3.25). So approximately 109.8 MeV. \n\nTherefore, the muon's energy is 109.8 MeV. \n\nThe rest mass energy of the muon is 105.7, so the kinetic energy is E - m_mu c\u00b2 = 109.8 -105.7 = 4.1 MeV. \n\nThe neutrino's energy is p \u224829.78 MeV, so its kinetic energy is the same (since massless), 29.78 MeV.",

Then the energy equation becomes:\n\nE_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.\n\nThe momentum conservation requires that the muon's momentum p_mu is equal in magnitude to the neutrino's momentum p_nu, but opposite in direction, so their magnitudes are equal. Since neutrino is massless, E_nu = p_nu. So p_nu = E_nu. \n\nThe muon's energy is sqrt( p_mu\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 ), where p_mu = p_nu (since magnitude same).

          "text1": "Wait, perhaps the confusion is because of units. Let me see:\n\nLet me define variables in units where c=1. Then the pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV. The muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV. Then the energy equation becomes:\n\nE_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.\n\nThe momentum conservation requires that the muon's momentum p_mu is equal in magnitude to the neutrino's momentum p_nu, but opposite in direction, so their magnitudes are equal. Since neutrino is massless, E_nu = p_nu. So p_nu = E_nu. \n\nThe muon's energy is sqrt( p_mu\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 ), where p_mu = p_nu (since magnitude same). So:\n\nE_mu = sqrt( p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2 )\n\nE_nu = p \n\nSo total energy equation:\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2) + p = 139.6 \n\nWhich is exactly the equation I had before. \n\nSo solving that gives p \u224829.78 MeV/c (since in natural units, c=1, so p is in MeV/c, but when multiplied by c, that gives MeV for energy terms). \n\nSo the neutrino's energy is p \u224829.78 MeV. \n\nThe muon's energy is sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ). Let me calculate that. \n\nFirst, (29.78)^2 \u2248 886.8 \n\n(105.7)^2 = 11172.49 \n\nAdding those gives 11172.49 +886.8 \u2248 12059.29 \n\nTaking the square root: sqrt(12059.29). Let's see, sqrt(12059) is about 109.8. Because 110^2 is 12100, so sqrt(12059) is a bit less, like 109.8. Let me check 109.8 squared: 109^2 is 11881, 0.8 squared is 0.64, cross term 2*109*0.8=174.4. So 109.8^2 = (109 +0.8)^2 = 109\u00b2 + 2*109*0.8 +0.8\u00b2 = 11881 + 174.4 +0.64 = 12056.04. Close to 12059.29. \n\nSo sqrt(12059.29) \u2248109.8 (since the difference is about 3.25). So approximately 109.8 MeV. \n\nTherefore, the muon's energy is 109.8 MeV. \n\nThe rest mass energy of the muon is 105.7, so the kinetic energy is E - m_mu c\u00b2 = 109.8 -105.7 = 4.1 MeV. \n\nThe neutrino's energy is p \u224829.78 MeV, so its kinetic energy is the same (since massless), 29.78 MeV.",

But since momentum must be conserved, the momenta must be equal and opposite. So the momentum of the muon and neutrino are equal in magnitude.\n\nThe momentum of the muon can be given by p = sqrt( (E_mu)^2 - m_mu^2 ), where E_mu is the total energy of the muon (rest + KE).\n\nThe neutrino's energy is E_nu = p (since p = E for a massless particle).\n\nThe total energy of the system is E_mu + E_nu = m_pi.\n\nSo let me define E_mu = m_mu + K_mu,\n\nand E_nu = p,\n\nand p = sqrt( (E_mu)^2 - m_mu^2 )\n\nThen,\n\nE_mu + sqrt(E_mu\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2) = m_pi.\n\nLet me let E_mu = x,\n\nthen the equation is:\n\nx + sqrt(x\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2) = m_pi\n\nLet me solve for x.\n\nLet me set y = sqrt(x\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2),\n\nthen x + y = m_pi,\n\nand y = sqrt(x\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2).\n\nFrom first equation: y = m_pi - x,\n\nso substitute into second equation:\n\nm_pi - x = sqrt(x\u00b2 - m_mu^2 )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(m_pi - x)^2 = x\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2,\n\nExpand left side: m_pi\u00b2 -2 m_pi x +x\u00b2 = x\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2,\n\nCancel x\u00b2 terms:\n\nm_pi\u00b2 -2 m_pi x = - m_mu\u00b2,\n\nRearranged:\n\nm_pi\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 = 2 m_pi x,\n\nso x = (m_pi\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2)/(2 m_pi)",

Then the energy equation becomes:\n\nE_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.\n\nThe momentum conservation requires that the muon's momentum p_mu is equal in magnitude to the neutrino's momentum p_nu, but opposite in direction, so their magnitudes are equal. Since neutrino is massless, E_nu = p_nu. So p_nu = E_nu. \n\nThe muon's energy is sqrt( p_mu\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 ), where p_mu = p_nu (since magnitude same). So:\n\nE_mu = sqrt( p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2 )\n\nE_nu = p \n\nSo total energy equation:\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2) + p = 139.6 \n\nWhich is exactly the equation I had before. \n\nSo solving that gives p \u224829.78 MeV/c (since in natural units, c=1, so p is in MeV/c, but when multiplied by c, that gives MeV for energy terms). \n\nSo the neutrino's energy is p \u224829.78 MeV. \n\nThe muon's energy is sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

Let's see, sqrt(12059) is about 109.8. Because 110^2 is 12100, so sqrt(12059) is a bit less, like 109.8. Let me check 109.8 squared: 109^2 is 11881, 0.8 squared is 0.64, cross term 2*109*0.8=174.4. So 109.8^2 = (109 +0.8)^2 = 109\u00b2 + 2*109*0.8 +0.8\u00b2 = 11881 + 174.4 +0.64 = 12056.04. Close to 12059.29. \n\nSo sqrt(12059.29) \u2248109.8 (since the difference is about 3.25).
