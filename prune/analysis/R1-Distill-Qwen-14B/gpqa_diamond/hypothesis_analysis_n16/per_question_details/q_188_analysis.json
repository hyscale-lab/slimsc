Therefore, the formula becomes:\n\nd = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2hk cos \u03b1 + 2hl cos \u03b1 + 2kl cos \u03b1 )\n\nSo that's the same as:\n\nd = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2 cos \u03b1 (hk + hl + kl) )\n\nAh! So I think I missed that all those cos terms are the same. That changes everything. \n\nSo in the previous example, when I substituted, I should have:\n\nThe denominator inside the square root is:\n\nh\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 + 2 cos \u03b1 (hk + hl + kl)\n\nSince h=k=l=1,\n\nThat term becomes 1+1+1 + 2 cos \u03b1 (1+1+1) = 3 + 2*(3 cos \u03b1)\n\nSo total inside sqrt: 3 + 6 cos \u03b1.\n\nAh! That's where I messed up earlier. Because I thought the cross terms were three terms each multiplied by cos of different angles, but in reality, since all angles are the same, it's actually adding all three cross terms each multiplied by cos \u03b1, so that's 2 cos \u03b1*(hk + hl + kl).\n\nSo the correct denominator term is 3 + 6 cos \u03b1.\n\nLet me recalculate.\n\nGiven \u03b1 = 30\u00b0, so cos 30\u00b0 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nSo:\n\nDenominator inside sqrt is 3 + 6*(0.8660) = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196, same as before.",
          "text2": "Wait, that seems more manageable. Let me check that formula. Let me see. Suppose that in rhombohedral, the formula simplifies to that? Let me think. Since all angles are equal, the cross terms would all have cos \u03b1. Since each of the terms like 2hk cos \u03b3 would be cos \u03b1, since \u03b3 is \u03b1 here. Similarly for other terms. So, yes, the formula becomes:\n\nd_hkl = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nYes, that seems correct. Let me confirm. Let me see if that's the case. For example, in a cubic system with angles 90 degrees, cos \u03b1 = 0, so it reduces to a / sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2). Which is correct. So this formula works for rhombohedral.\n\nTherefore, plugging in the values here. \n\nWe have h, k, l all equal to 1. So h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 = 1+1+1=3.\n\nThen the cross terms: 2*(hk + hl + kl)*cos \u03b1. Since hk =1*1=1, same for the others. So (hk + hl + kl)=3, so that term is 2*3*cos(30\u00b0).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nDenominator under the sqrt is 3 + 2*3*(cos 30\u00b0).\n\ncos(30\u00b0) is sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.8660.\n\nSo 2*3*(0.8660)= 3*2*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3*sqrt(3).",

Therefore, the formula becomes:\n\nd = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2hk cos \u03b1 + 2hl cos \u03b1 + 2kl cos \u03b1 )\n\nSo that's the same as:\n\nd = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2 cos \u03b1 (hk + hl + kl) )\n\nAh! So I think I missed that all those cos terms are the same. That changes everything. \n\nSo in the previous example, when I substituted, I should have:\n\nThe denominator inside the square root is:\n\nh\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 + 2 cos \u03b1 (hk + hl + kl)\n\nSince h=k=l=1,\n\nThat term becomes 1+1+1 + 2 cos \u03b1 (1+1+1) = 3 + 2*(3 cos \u03b1)\n\nSo total inside sqrt: 3 + 6 cos \u03b1.\n\nAh! That's where I messed up earlier. Because I thought the cross terms were three terms each multiplied by cos of different angles, but in reality, since all angles are the same, it's actually adding all three cross terms each multiplied by cos \u03b1, so that's 2 cos \u03b1*(hk + hl + kl).\n\nSo the correct denominator term is 3 + 6 cos \u03b1.\n\nLet me recalculate.\n\nGiven \u03b1 = 30\u00b0, so cos 30\u00b0 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nSo:\n\nDenominator inside sqrt is 3 + 6*(0.8660) = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196, same as before.",

Since all angles are equal, the cross terms would all have cos \u03b1. Since each of the terms like 2hk cos \u03b3 would be cos \u03b1, since \u03b3 is \u03b1 here. Similarly for other terms. So, yes, the formula becomes:\n\nd_hkl = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nYes, that seems correct. Let me confirm. Let me see if that's the case. For example, in a cubic system with angles 90 degrees, cos \u03b1 = 0, so it reduces to a / sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2). Which is correct. So this formula works for rhombohedral.\n\nTherefore, plugging in the values here. \n\nWe have h, k, l all equal to 1. So h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 = 1+1+1=3.\n\nThen the cross terms: 2*(hk + hl + kl)*cos \u03b1. Since hk =1*1=1, same for the others. So (hk + hl + kl)=3, so that term is 2*3*cos(30\u00b0).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nDenominator under the sqrt is 3 + 2*3*(cos 30\u00b0).\n\ncos(30\u00b0) is sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.8660.\n\nSo 2*3*(0.8660)= 3*2*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3*sqrt(3).",

Therefore, the formula becomes:\n\nd = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2hk cos \u03b1 + 2hl cos \u03b1 + 2kl cos \u03b1 )\n\nSo that's the same as:\n\nd = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2 cos \u03b1 (hk + hl + kl) )\n\nAh! So I think I missed that all those cos terms are the same.

That's where I messed up earlier. Because I thought the cross terms were three terms each multiplied by cos of different angles, but in reality, since all angles are the same, it's actually adding all three cross terms each multiplied by cos \u03b1, so that's 2 cos \u03b1*(hk + hl + kl).\n\nSo the correct denominator term is 3 + 6 cos \u03b1.\n\nLet me recalculate.\n\nGiven \u03b1 = 30\u00b0, so cos 30\u00b0 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nSo:\n\nDenominator inside sqrt is 3 + 6*(0.8660) = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196, same as before.",

Since all angles are equal, the cross terms would all have cos \u03b1. Since each of the terms like 2hk cos \u03b3 would be cos \u03b1, since \u03b3 is \u03b1 here. Similarly for other terms. So, yes, the formula becomes:\n\nd_hkl = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nYes, that seems correct. Let me confirm. Let me see if that's the case. For example, in a cubic system with angles 90 degrees, cos \u03b1 = 0, so it reduces to a / sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2). Which is correct. So this formula works for rhombohedral.\n\nTherefore, plugging in the values here. \n\nWe have h, k, l all equal to 1. So h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 = 1+1+1=3.\n\nThen the cross terms: 2*(hk + hl + kl)*cos \u03b1. Since hk =1*1=1, same for the others. So (hk + hl + kl)=3, so that term is 2*3*cos(30\u00b0).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nDenominator under the sqrt is 3 + 2*3*(cos 30\u00b0).\n\ncos(30\u00b0) is sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.8660.\n\nSo 2*3*(0.8660)= 3*2*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3*sqrt(3).",

What is the interplanar distance of the (111) plane of the crystal?\"\n\nAh!

Or perhaps the interatomic distance refers to the distance between atoms in the crystal along some direction, but it's not necessarily the lattice parameter.",

Therefore, the formula becomes:\n\nd = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2hk cos \u03b1 + 2hl cos \u03b1 + 2kl cos \u03b1 )\n\nSo that's the same as:\n\nd = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2 cos \u03b1 (hk + hl + kl) )\n\nAh!

That's where I messed up earlier. Because I thought the cross terms were three terms each multiplied by cos of different angles, but in reality, since all angles are the same, it's actually adding all three cross terms each multiplied by cos \u03b1, so that's 2 cos \u03b1*(hk + hl + kl).\n\nSo the correct denominator term is 3 + 6 cos \u03b1.\n\nLet me recalculate.\n\nGiven \u03b1 = 30\u00b0, so cos 30\u00b0 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nSo:\n\nDenominator inside sqrt is 3 + 6*(0.8660) = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196, same as before.",

Since all angles are equal, the cross terms would all have cos \u03b1. Since each of the terms like 2hk cos \u03b3 would be cos \u03b1, since \u03b3 is \u03b1 here. Similarly for other terms. So, yes, the formula becomes:\n\nd_hkl = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nYes, that seems correct. Let me confirm. Let me see if that's the case. For example, in a cubic system with angles 90 degrees, cos \u03b1 = 0, so it reduces to a / sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2). Which is correct. So this formula works for rhombohedral.\n\nTherefore, plugging in the values here. \n\nWe have h, k, l all equal to 1. So h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 = 1+1+1=3.\n\nThen the cross terms: 2*(hk + hl + kl)*cos \u03b1. Since hk =1*1=1, same for the others. So (hk + hl + kl)=3, so that term is 2*3*cos(30\u00b0).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nDenominator under the sqrt is 3 + 2*3*(cos 30\u00b0).\n\ncos(30\u00b0) is sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.8660.\n\nSo 2*3*(0.8660)= 3*2*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3*sqrt(3).",

So, yes, the formula becomes:\n\nd_hkl = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nYes, that seems correct. Let me confirm. Let me see if that's the case. For example, in a cubic system with angles 90 degrees, cos \u03b1 = 0, so it reduces to a / sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2). Which is correct. So this formula works for rhombohedral.\n\nTherefore, plugging in the values here. \n\nWe have h, k, l all equal to 1.

So, yes, the formula becomes:\n\nd_hkl = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nYes, that seems correct. Let me confirm. Let me see if that's the case. For example, in a cubic system with angles 90 degrees, cos \u03b1 = 0, so it reduces to a / sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2). Which is correct.

So, yes, the formula becomes:\n\nd_hkl = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nYes, that seems correct. Let me confirm. Let me see if that's the case.

So h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 = 1+1+1=3.\n\nThen the cross terms: 2*(hk + hl + kl)*cos \u03b1. Since hk =1*1=1, same for the others. So (hk + hl + kl)=3, so that term is 2*3*cos(30\u00b0).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nDenominator under the sqrt is 3 + 2*3*(cos 30\u00b0).\n\ncos(30\u00b0) is sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.8660.\n\nSo 2*3*(0.8660)= 3*2*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3*sqrt(3).",

Therefore, the formula becomes:\n\nd = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2hk cos \u03b1 + 2hl cos \u03b1 + 2kl cos \u03b1 )\n\nSo that's the same as:\n\nd = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2 cos \u03b1 (hk + hl + kl) )\n\nAh!

Since all angles are equal, the cross terms would all have cos \u03b1. Since each of the terms like 2hk cos \u03b3 would be cos \u03b1, since \u03b3 is \u03b1 here. Similarly for other terms. So, yes, the formula becomes:\n\nd_hkl = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nYes, that seems correct. Let me confirm. Let me see if that's the case. For example, in a cubic system with angles 90 degrees, cos \u03b1 = 0, so it reduces to a / sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2). Which is correct. So this formula works for rhombohedral.\n\nTherefore, plugging in the values here. \n\nWe have h, k, l all equal to 1. So h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 = 1+1+1=3.\n\nThen the cross terms: 2*(hk + hl + kl)*cos \u03b1. Since hk =1*1=1, same for the others. So (hk + hl + kl)=3, so that term is 2*3*cos(30\u00b0).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nDenominator under the sqrt is 3 + 2*3*(cos 30\u00b0).\n\ncos(30\u00b0) is sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.8660.\n\nSo 2*3*(0.8660)= 3*2*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3*sqrt(3).",
