So if the original enol had a double bond between C1 and C2, then ozonolysis would create carbonyl groups on those carbons. \n\nNow, the NMR of product 3 must be analyzed.

Let me see: the final step is ozone followed by DMS. So after ozonolysis, the double bonds are cleaved. Let me think of the structure. Let's assume product 1 is a 1,3-diketone of adamantane. Then, when treated with base (aluminum isopropoxide), perhaps the two ketones undergo an intramolecular aldol condensation. The base would deprotonate one of the ketone's alpha hydrogens, and the enolate would attack the carbonyl of the other ketone, forming a conjugated diene. The dehydration would remove water, leading to a diene. So product 2 would be a conjugated diene. \n\nThen, ozonolysis of the diene would break it into two aldehydes. Since adamantane is a rigid structure with multiple CH2 groups, the ozonolysis would split the diene into two fragments. The DMS would then reduce the aldehydes to alcohols. Thus, product 3 would have two alcohol groups. \n\nNow, we need to determine the 1H NMR of product 3. The question asks about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding those exchanging with solvent, so not the OH protons). \n\nFirst, let's figure out the structure of product 3. Starting with product 1 (diketone), after forming a diene (product 2), ozonolysis would cleave the diene into two carbonyl groups, which are then reduced to alcohols. So product 3 would have two -OH groups where the double bonds were. \n\nThe most deshielded hydrogen would be the one closest to an electronegative group, like an oxygen. But in the structure of adamantane, the original positions of the ketones (product 1) would become sites of the diol in product 3. The hydrogens adjacent to the -OH groups would be deshielded.",
