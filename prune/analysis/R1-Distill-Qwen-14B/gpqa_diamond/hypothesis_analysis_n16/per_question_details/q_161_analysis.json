Let me read again.\n\nThe problem says Mike \"determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state... to be \u03bb1... However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to \u03bb1; rather, it was \u03bb2...\"\n\nHmm, so the initial \u03bb1 was the mean free path of the gas molecules (their collisions with each other). Then, when the electron beam is on, he's measuring the mean free path of the electrons as they scatter off the gas molecules. So the \u03bb2 here would be the mean free path of the electrons, not the gas molecules.",

Let me think. \n\nActually, the mean free path formula \u03bb = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*\u03c0*r\u00b2*N) for molecules assumes that the average velocity is (sqrt(8kT/\u03c0m)), but the formula ends up being written in terms of T and not velocity. So perhaps when considering electrons, their velocity is much higher, but the mean free path formula still depends on the cross-section and density. The velocity would affect how often they collide, but the mean free path is the average distance between collisions, which would be velocity multiplied by the time between collisions. The time between collisions is 1/(n\u03c3 v), so the mean free path is (1/(n\u03c3)) * (1/v) * v?",
