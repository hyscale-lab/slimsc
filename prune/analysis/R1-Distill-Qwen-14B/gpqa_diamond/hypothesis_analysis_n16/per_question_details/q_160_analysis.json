The factor 1.22 comes from the first zero of the Bessel function J1. Since J1's first zero is at 3.83, so the formula is (3.83) * (\u03bb/(\u03c0 D)), but since sin\u03b8 = (3.83 \u03bb)/(\u03c0 D), and for small angles, sin\u03b8 \u2248 \u03b8, so \u03b8 \u2248 1.22 \u03bb/D (since 3.83 / \u03c0 \u2248 1.22). \n\nSo \u03b8 = 1.22 \u03bb/D.

Since J1's first zero is at 3.83, so the formula is (3.83) * (\u03bb/(\u03c0 D)), but since sin\u03b8 = (3.83 \u03bb)/(\u03c0 D), and for small angles, sin\u03b8 \u2248 \u03b8, so \u03b8 \u2248 1.22 \u03bb/D (since 3.83 / \u03c0 \u2248 1.22). \n\nSo \u03b8 = 1.22 \u03bb/D. Here D is the diameter. Since in our case, the apothem a is equal to the radius (since for a circle, the apothem is the radius). Therefore, D = 2a. So substituting, \u03b8 = 1.22 * \u03bb/(2a) = (0.61) \u03bb/a. \n\nTherefore, the first minimum is at 0.61 \u03bb/a from the central axis. The next minimum (the second one) would be at the second zero of the Bessel function. The second zero of J\u2081 is at around 7.015, so the angle would be (7.015 / \u03c0) * (\u03bb/D) \u2248 2.23 * \u03bb/D. Substituting D=2a gives 2.23/(2a) * \u03bb \u2248 1.115 * \u03bb/a. \n\nSo the angular distance between the first and second minima would be (1.115 - 0.61) * (\u03bb/a) \u2248 0.505 \u03bb/a. Hmm, that's close to option D (0.506).",

The condition for the first minimum in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is given by the Bessel function J1, which has its first zero at approximately x \u2248 3.8318. The formula for the angle \u03b8 is given by sin\u03b8 = (3.8318\u03bb)/d, where d is the diameter. But since the angle is small, sin\u03b8 \u2248 tan\u03b8 \u2248 \u03b8 (in radians). Therefore, \u03b8 \u2248 3.8318\u03bb / d. However, the commonly used approximation is that the first minimum occurs at \u03b8 \u2248 1.22 \u03bb / D, where D is the diameter. Let me see where that comes from. \n\nAh, right, because 1.22 is approximately (3.83/\u03c0), so 3.83/(\u03c0) \u2248 1.22. So when you write the formula as (3.83 \u03bb)/D, but if you approximate using small angles, and considering the relation with the first minimum, then \u03b8 = 1.22 \u03bb/D. \n\nSo in our case, D is the diameter.

The factor 1.22 comes from the first zero of the Bessel function J1.

Now, if the first two minima are the first minimum on either side of the central maximum, then the angular distance between them would be twice that angle, so 2 * 0.610 = 1.220 lambda/a (option C).",

Let me check my notes. \n\nThe formula comes from the condition that the path difference between light from the edge of the aperture and the center is such that the destructive interference occurs when the angle corresponds to a half-integer multiple of the wavelength, but adjusted for the circular geometry. The factor 1.22 comes from the first zero of the Bessel function J1. Since J1's first zero is at 3.83, so the formula is (3.83) * (\u03bb/(\u03c0 D)), but since sin\u03b8 = (3.83 \u03bb)/(\u03c0 D), and for small angles, sin\u03b8 \u2248 \u03b8, so \u03b8 \u2248 1.22 \u03bb/D (since 3.83 / \u03c0 \u2248 1.22). \n\nSo \u03b8 = 1.22 \u03bb/D.

Let me check my notes. \n\nThe formula comes from the condition that the path difference between light from the edge of the aperture and the center is such that the destructive interference occurs when the angle corresponds to a half-integer multiple of the wavelength, but adjusted for the circular geometry. The factor 1.22 comes from the first zero of the Bessel function J1. Since J1's first zero is at 3.83, so the formula is (3.83) * (\u03bb/(\u03c0 D)), but since sin\u03b8 = (3.83 \u03bb)/(\u03c0 D), and for small angles, sin\u03b8 \u2248 \u03b8, so \u03b8 \u2248 1.22 \u03bb/D (since 3.83 / \u03c0 \u2248 1.22). \n\nSo \u03b8 = 1.22 \u03bb/D.

The formula for the angle \u03b8 is given by sin\u03b8 = (3.8318\u03bb)/d, where d is the diameter. But since the angle is small, sin\u03b8 \u2248 tan\u03b8 \u2248 \u03b8 (in radians).

The factor 1.22 comes from the first zero of the Bessel function J1. Since J1's first zero is at 3.83, so the formula is (3.83) * (\u03bb/(\u03c0 D)), but since sin\u03b8 = (3.83 \u03bb)/(\u03c0 D), and for small angles, sin\u03b8 \u2248 \u03b8, so \u03b8 \u2248 1.22 \u03bb/D (since 3.83 / \u03c0 \u2248 1.22). \n\nSo \u03b8 = 1.22 \u03bb/D.

The factor 1.22 comes from the first zero of the Bessel function J1. Since J1's first zero is at 3.83, so the formula is (3.83) * (\u03bb/(\u03c0 D)), but since sin\u03b8 = (3.83 \u03bb)/(\u03c0 D), and for small angles, sin\u03b8 \u2248 \u03b8, so \u03b8 \u2248 1.22 \u03bb/D (since 3.83 / \u03c0 \u2248 1.22). \n\nSo \u03b8 = 1.22 \u03bb/D.

The factor 1.22 comes from the first zero of the Bessel function J1. Since J1's first zero is at 3.83, so the formula is (3.83) * (\u03bb/(\u03c0 D)), but since sin\u03b8 = (3.83 \u03bb)/(\u03c0 D), and for small angles, sin\u03b8 \u2248 \u03b8, so \u03b8 \u2248 1.22 \u03bb/D (since 3.83 / \u03c0 \u2248 1.22). \n\nSo \u03b8 = 1.22 \u03bb/D.

The factor 1.22 comes from the first zero of the Bessel function J1. Since J1's first zero is at 3.83, so the formula is (3.83) * (\u03bb/(\u03c0 D)), but since sin\u03b8 = (3.83 \u03bb)/(\u03c0 D), and for small angles, sin\u03b8 \u2248 \u03b8, so \u03b8 \u2248 1.22 \u03bb/D (since 3.83 / \u03c0 \u2248 1.22). \n\nSo \u03b8 = 1.22 \u03bb/D. Here D is the diameter. Since in our case, the apothem a is equal to the radius (since for a circle, the apothem is the radius). Therefore, D = 2a.

          "text1": "Alternatively, think of the aperture as a polygon with N sides, and when N approaches infinity, it's a circle. The first minimum in the diffraction pattern corresponds to the first zero in the Bessel function, which occurs at the first order. The formula is indeed theta = 1.22 lambda / D, where D is the diameter. \n\nGiven that, assuming that the question wants the angle from the center to the first minimum, the answer is 1.22/(2a) * lambda, so 0.61, which is A. But if it's the angular separation between the two minima on opposite sides, then it's C. \n\nThe problem's wording is ambiguous, but in standard terminology, when someone asks for the angular distance between the first two minima in a circular aperture's diffraction pattern, they might mean the angle from the center to the first minimum. But in other contexts, like single-slit, the separation between the first two minima is twice the angle. \n\nThe problem mentions \"the angular distance between the first two minima\". Since the first two minima are the ones closest to the center, they are on opposite sides, so the angular distance between them is twice the angle to the center. Therefore, it would be 1.22 lambda/a, option C.",
          "text2": "Alternatively, maybe the question is using a different approach. Let's think again. The problem states that the aperture is a polygon with infinite sides (so a circle) with apothem a. The apothem of a polygon is the distance from the center to the side. For a circle, the apothem is equal to the radius. So the radius R = a. The diameter D is 2a. \n\nThe formula for the first minimum in the diffraction pattern is given by the angle \u03b8 such that:\n\nsin\u03b8 = (1.22 \u03bb)/D \n\nBut since \u03b8 is small, sin\u03b8 \u2248 tan\u03b8 \u2248 \u03b8. So \u03b8 \u2248 1.22 \u03bb / D = 1.22 \u03bb/(2a) = 0.61 \u03bb/a. \n\nNow, the question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima. In the case of a circular aperture, the first minimum is at \u03b8 = 0.61 \u03bb/a, and the second minimum (the next one) is at \u03b8 = (2.236 \u03bb)/D = 2.236/(2a) * \u03bb \u2248 (1.118 \u03bb)/a. The difference between these two is (1.118 - 0.61) \u2248 0.508 \u03bb/a, which is approximately 0.506 as in option D. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D.",

Since in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture, the first minimum is a ring around the central maximum. The minima are circular rings, so there are not two minima in a line, but a ring. So the angular distance between the first and second minima would refer to the angular separation between the first dark ring and the second dark ring. That distance would be the difference between their angles, which is approximately 0.506 \u03bb/a. \n\nGiven the options, the closest is D (0.506).",

The second minimum is the second dark ring. The angular distance between them is the difference between their angles. \n\nSo the first minimum is at 0.610 lambda/a (since that's the first zero's angle), and the second is at (7.0156)/(2 pi a) * lambda. \n\nCalculating 7.0156/(2 pi) is approx 7.0156 /6.283 \u2248 1.116.
