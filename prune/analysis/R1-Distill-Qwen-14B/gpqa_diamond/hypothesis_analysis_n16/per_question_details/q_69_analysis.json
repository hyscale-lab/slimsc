So, gamma is E/(m c\u00b2). Since m c\u00b2 is 3.41 GeV, gamma = 27 / 3.41 \u2248 let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41. Let's see, 3.41 times 7 is 23.87, so 27 - 23.87 is 3.13, so maybe around 7.9? Let me compute it exactly. 27 / 3.41. Let's see, 3.41 * 7.9 = 3*7.9 =23.7 plus 0.41*7.9\u22483.239, total \u224826.939.

Let me do this division. 3.41 times 8 is 27.28, so 27 divided by 3.41 is a bit less than 8. Let me see: 3.41 * 7.9 is 3.41*(8 -0.1) =27.28 -0.341= 26.939. Close to 27. So \u03b3 is approximately 7.9. Let me compute it precisely. 27/3.41. Let's see: 3.41 * 7 = 23.87. 27 -23.87 =3.13. 3.13/3.41 is approx 0.918. So total \u03b3 \u22487.918.

Oh my goodness, maybe that's it. Because in particle physics, sometimes energy can refer to total energy or kinetic energy depending on context. Let me check the problem again.\n\n\"Knowing that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV, and the mass of X\u2070 is 3.41GeV.\"\n\nHmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. \"The energy in the Bubble Chamber\" \u2014 perhaps the kinetic energy of the particle? Or total energy? Since in a bubble chamber, particles are accelerated to certain energies, so the energy given is probably the total energy. But maybe it's the kinetic. Let me see.\n\nIf the energy given is the kinetic energy (K), then total energy E = K + m c\u00b2. In that case, E =27 +3.41=30.41 GeV. So then:\n\n\u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2) =30.41 /3.41\u22488.917.\n\nThen \u03c4 would be \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 =8.917\u00d78e-16 \u22487.134e-15 s.\n\nVelocity v:\n\nv = c sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3)^2).

That's about 2.13e-6 m, which is close to option A (2.08e-6 m). \n\nAh! So that's probably the mistake. The question says \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV\". If that energy is the kinetic energy, then the total energy is K + m c\u00b2 =27 +3.41=30.41 GeV. That gives a higher \u03b3 and thus a longer decay length. So then the decay length would be approximately 2.1e-6, close to option A (2.08e-6). So I must have misinterpreted the energy as total instead of kinetic.\n\nSo the key was whether the given energy is total or kinetic. Since in many contexts, the energy of a particle in a bubble chamber refers to its total energy, but maybe in this case, it's the kinetic.",

So is that the total energy of the particle (E=gamma m c\u00b2), or just the kinetic energy (K = (gamma -1)m c\u00b2). \n\nThe problem statement is ambiguous. But in high-energy physics, when they say the energy of a particle in the lab frame, it usually refers to the total energy. So I think the initial approach is correct. However, if it's the kinetic energy, then the total energy is 27 +3.41 =30.41 GeV. \n\nLet me try that scenario. \n\nSuppose the energy given is the kinetic energy, so K =27 GeV.

Let me see, 0.99 squared is 0.9801, 0.992 squared is (0.99 +0.002)^2 =0.99\u00b2 + 2*0.99*0.002 + (0.002)^2 =0.9801 +0.00396 +0.000004 = ~0.984064. Oh! That's exactly the number we have. So sqrt(0.984064) is exactly 0.992. So that's correct. So \u03b2 is 0.992, so v is 0.992c. \n\nTherefore, the velocity is correct. \n\nHmm, maybe I messed up the exponents in the distance calculation? Let me check again:\n\nv =0.992 * 3e8 m/s \u2192 ~2.976e8 m/s. \n\nt is 2.26e-15 seconds.\n\nMultiply them: 2.976e8 * 2.26e-15 = (2.976 *2.26) * 1e(8-15) \u2192 1e-7. \n\nSo 2.976 *2.26 is as before ~6.725. So 6.725e-7 meters. \n\nHmm, that's 6.7e-7 m. The options are:\n\nA) 2.08e-6 m (2.08 micrometers)\n\nB) 2.08e-9 m (2.08 nanometers)\n\nC) 2.08e-1 m (0.2 meters)\n\nD) 2.08e-3 m (2 millimeters?)\n\nNone of these are close to 6.7e-7.",

Oh my goodness, maybe that's it. Because in particle physics, sometimes energy can refer to total energy or kinetic energy depending on context. Let me check the problem again.\n\n\"Knowing that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV, and the mass of X\u2070 is 3.41GeV.\"\n\nHmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. \"The energy in the Bubble Chamber\" \u2014 perhaps the kinetic energy of the particle? Or total energy? Since in a bubble chamber, particles are accelerated to certain energies, so the energy given is probably the total energy. But maybe it's the kinetic. Let me see.\n\nIf the energy given is the kinetic energy (K), then total energy E = K + m c\u00b2. In that case, E =27 +3.41=30.41 GeV. So then:\n\n\u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2) =30.41 /3.41\u22488.917.\n\nThen \u03c4 would be \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 =8.917\u00d78e-16 \u22487.134e-15 s.\n\nVelocity v:\n\nv = c sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3)^2).

That's about 2.13e-6 m, which is close to option A (2.08e-6 m). \n\nAh! So that's probably the mistake. The question says \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV\". If that energy is the kinetic energy, then the total energy is K + m c\u00b2 =27 +3.41=30.41 GeV. That gives a higher \u03b3 and thus a longer decay length. So then the decay length would be approximately 2.1e-6, close to option A (2.08e-6). So I must have misinterpreted the energy as total instead of kinetic.\n\nSo the key was whether the given energy is total or kinetic. Since in many contexts, the energy of a particle in a bubble chamber refers to its total energy, but maybe in this case, it's the kinetic.",

So is that the total energy of the particle (E=gamma m c\u00b2), or just the kinetic energy (K = (gamma -1)m c\u00b2). \n\nThe problem statement is ambiguous. But in high-energy physics, when they say the energy of a particle in the lab frame, it usually refers to the total energy. So I think the initial approach is correct. However, if it's the kinetic energy, then the total energy is 27 +3.41 =30.41 GeV. \n\nLet me try that scenario. \n\nSuppose the energy given is the kinetic energy, so K =27 GeV.

Let me see, 0.99 squared is 0.9801, 0.992 squared is (0.99 +0.002)^2 =0.99\u00b2 + 2*0.99*0.002 + (0.002)^2 =0.9801 +0.00396 +0.000004 = ~0.984064. Oh! That's exactly the number we have. So sqrt(0.984064) is exactly 0.992. So that's correct. So \u03b2 is 0.992, so v is 0.992c. \n\nTherefore, the velocity is correct. \n\nHmm, maybe I messed up the exponents in the distance calculation? Let me check again:\n\nv =0.992 * 3e8 m/s \u2192 ~2.976e8 m/s. \n\nt is 2.26e-15 seconds.\n\nMultiply them: 2.976e8 * 2.26e-15 = (2.976 *2.26) * 1e(8-15) \u2192 1e-7. \n\nSo 2.976 *2.26 is as before ~6.725. So 6.725e-7 meters. \n\nHmm, that's 6.7e-7 m. The options are:\n\nA) 2.08e-6 m (2.08 micrometers)\n\nB) 2.08e-9 m (2.08 nanometers)\n\nC) 2.08e-1 m (0.2 meters)\n\nD) 2.08e-3 m (2 millimeters?)\n\nNone of these are close to 6.7e-7.",

So then:\n\n\u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2) =30.41 /3.41\u22488.917.\n\nThen \u03c4 would be \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 =8.917\u00d78e-16 \u22487.134e-15 s.\n\nVelocity v:\n\nv = c sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3)^2). So 1/\u03b3 is ~0.112, squared is 0.012544. 1- that is 0.98746. sqrt of that is ~0.9937c.\n\nv=0.9937 *3e8=2.981e8 m/s.\n\nDecay length L =v \u03c4 =2.981e8 *7.134e-15 = (2.981 *7.134) *1e-7 m.\n\n2.981*7=20.867, 2.981*0.134\u22480.399, total\u224821.266e-7 m \u21922.1266e-6 m. That's about 2.13e-6 m, which is close to option A (2.08e-6 m). \n\nAh! So that's probably the mistake. The question says \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV\". If that energy is the kinetic energy, then the total energy is K + m c\u00b2 =27 +3.41=30.41 GeV. That gives a higher \u03b3 and thus a longer decay length. So then the decay length would be approximately 2.1e-6, close to option A (2.08e-6). So I must have misinterpreted the energy as total instead of kinetic.\n\nSo the key was whether the given energy is total or kinetic. Since in many contexts, the energy of a particle in a bubble chamber refers to its total energy, but maybe in this case, it's the kinetic.",
          "text2": "Wait, that's a crucial point. The question says the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV. So is that the total energy of the particle (E=gamma m c\u00b2), or just the kinetic energy (K = (gamma -1)m c\u00b2). \n\nThe problem statement is ambiguous. But in high-energy physics, when they say the energy of a particle in the lab frame, it usually refers to the total energy. So I think the initial approach is correct. However, if it's the kinetic energy, then the total energy is 27 +3.41 =30.41 GeV. \n\nLet me try that scenario. \n\nSuppose the energy given is the kinetic energy, so K =27 GeV.

So 1-0.01257 =0.9874. sqrt of that is about 0.9937. \n\nSo v =0.9937c. \n\nThen gamma is 8.918, so the lab frame lifetime \u03c4= gamma * tau_0 =8.918 *8e-16 =7.134e-15 s. \n\nThen, the distance for 30% decay is v * \u03c4 * (-ln(0.7)). \n\nv is 0.9937 *3e8 \u22482.981e8 m/s \n\nMultiply by \u03c4: 2.981e8 *7.134e-15 = \n\nFirst 2.981 *7.134 \u224821.23. \n\nSo 21.23e-7 m =2.123e-6 m. \n\nThen multiply by 0.35667 (the factor for 30%): \n\n2.123e-6 *0.35667 \u22480.756e-6 m. \n\nHmm, still not matching.",

The minimum resolution needed is the distance between the point where the X\u2070 was created and the point where it decayed, so that the detector can observe the decay. \n\nTo observe a decay, the particle must decay within the bubble chamber, and the resolution must be sufficient to detect the decay point. \n\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution such that 30% of decays are observed.

But the question says \"minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays\".\n\nHmm, this is confusing me. Let me think again. The decay occurs over some distance. The bubble chamber's resolution must be able to distinguish the point where the decay happened from the start point, otherwise you can't tell where it decayed. So maybe the resolution must be smaller than the average decay length. But the question mentions 30%, so perhaps we need the distance where 30% of the decays have occurred, so that the resolution must be at least that distance?",

Because if the resolution is better than L_avg, then you can see the decay. But if they want at least 30% of the decays to be observed, then the required L is the distance where 30% have decayed. \n\nSo let me do this properly. \n\nThe decay probability over time follows an exponential distribution. The probability that a decay has occurred by time t is P(t) = 1 - exp(-t/\u03c4). \n\nThe distance traveled by the particle in time t is x = v t. \n\nTherefore, the probability that the decay occurs before x is P(x) = 1 - exp(-x/(v \u03c4 )) = 1 - exp(-x/L_avg), since L_avg = v \u03c4. \n\nWe need P(x) \u2265 0.3. \n\nSolving for x: \n\n1 - exp(-x/L_avg) \u2265 0.3 \n\nexp(-x/L_avg) \u2264 0.7 \n\nTake natural logarithm: \n\n- x / L_avg \u2264 ln 0.7 \n\nMultiply both sides by -1 (reverse inequality): \n\nx / L_avg \u2265 -ln 0.7 \n\nx \u2265 - L_avg * ln 0.7 \n\nCalculating -ln(0.7) \u2248 0.35667 \n\nThus x \u2265 0.35667 * L_avg \n\nTherefore, the required minimum resolution must be at least 0.3567 times the average decay length.",
