So the angle between them would be twice the angle each makes with the horizontal, right?\n\nFirst, I need to recall that in annihilation, the total momentum must be conserved. Since energy and momentum are both conserved, the photons must carry off the total momentum and energy of the electron and positron.\n\nLet me start by calculating the energies of the electron and positron. The Lorentz factor gamma is given for each. The rest mass energy of an electron (and positron) is 511 keV. The total energy of each particle is gamma times the rest mass energy. So:\n\nElectron's energy (E_e) = 4 * 511 keV = 2044 keV.\n\nPositron's energy (E_p) = 2 * 511 keV = 1022 keV.\n\nBut since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, its momentum vector is opposite to the electron's. Let's set up a coordinate system where the electron is moving along the positive x-axis, so the positron is moving along the negative x-axis.\n\nThe total momentum before collision is the vector sum of the electron and positron momenta.

So the answer would be 2\u03b8, but I need to find what \u03b8 is.\n\nLet me think in terms of vectors. Let me denote the horizontal direction as the x-axis, and vertical as y. The initial momentum of the electron is p_e (since moving to the right) and the positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is -p_p. So total initial momentum is p_e - p_p. The photons each have momentum vectors. Let\u2019s call their momenta p_photon1 and p_photon2. Their sum must equal p_e - p_p.\n\nSince the photons have the same energy, their magnitudes are the same, let's call that p_photon (since p = E/c and E is same for both). The first photon is moving at angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, so its momentum components are p_photon * cos\u03b8 (x-component) and p_photon * sin\u03b8 (y-component). The second is moving at -\u03b8 below the x-axis, so its components are p_photon * cos\u03b8 and -p_photon * sin\u03b8. Adding these two, the y-components cancel. The x-components add up to 2 p_photon cos\u03b8. \n\nSo the total momentum after collision is 2 p_photon cos\u03b8 in the x-direction. This must equal the initial momentum (p_e - p_p). \n\nNow, energy conservation: the total energy before collision is the sum of the electron's energy and the positron's energy. Since they annihilate into two photons, the total energy is the sum of the photons' energies. Since each photon has energy E_photon = p_photon c, total energy is 2 p_photon c. \n\nSo energy before collision is (gamma_e + gamma_p) m_e c\u00b2 = 4 + 2 = 6 m_e c\u00b2. Therefore, 2 p_photon c = 6 m_e c\u00b2 => p_photon = 3 m_e c.\n\nSo p_photon is 3 m_e c.\n\nNow, the momentum equation:\n\n2 p_photon cos\u03b8 = p_e - p_p.",

Let me denote the electron's velocity as v_e and the positron's as v_p. Since they have Lorentz factors, gamma_e =4 and gamma_p=2. The Lorentz factor is gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). But perhaps I can work in units where c=1, so gamma is just 1/sqrt(1-v\u00b2). \n\nThe total energy before collision is the sum of the electron and positron's energies. Since they are moving in opposite directions, but their momenta are in opposite directions. So the total momentum will be the vector sum. Let me compute their energies first.\n\nThe energy of a particle with gamma is E = gamma * m c\u00b2. Since it's an electron and positron, their rest masses are equal. Let me assume the mass is m (since the actual value might not matter as things might cancel). \n\nSo electron energy: E_e = 4 m c\u00b2, positron energy E_p = 2 m c\u00b2. So total energy is (4 + 2)m c\u00b2 = 6 m c\u00b2.\n\nThe photons each have energy E_photon = (6 m c\u00b2)/2 = 3 m c\u00b2 each. So each photon has energy 3 m c\u00b2. Since E=pc for photons, their momentum magnitude is p = E/c = 3 m c. But direction matters for momentum.\n\nNow, the total momentum before collision must equal the total after.

The total momentum from the photons is p1 + p2. Let me represent their momenta as vectors. The problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So if we consider the coordinate system where the horizontal axis is the line of motion of the electron and positron (the x-axis), then upper-right would be in the +y direction, lower-right in the -y direction.

The total energy before collision is the sum of the electron and positron's energies. The electron's energy is 4m c\u00b2, the positron's is 2m c\u00b2, so total energy is 6m c\u00b2. Since both photons have the same energy, each must have 3m c\u00b2 energy. Because energy of a photon is E = pc, so each photon has momentum p = E/c = 3m c. \n\nNow, conservation of momentum. The initial momentum of the electron and positron must sum to the final momentum of the photons. Let me denote the electron's direction as the negative x-axis (since it's moving left) and the positron as the positive x-axis. Let me set up coordinate system where the electron is moving along -x and the positron along +x. \n\nThe initial momentum of the electron is (\u03b3_e * m_e) * v_e's direction.",

Since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), then v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2). So for the electron, v_e = c sqrt(1 - 1/(4)^2) = c sqrt(15/16) = (c)(\u221a15)/4. Similarly, for the positron with gamma 2, v_p = c sqrt(1 - 1/4) = c sqrt(3/4) = (c\u221a3)/2.\n\nThus, the electron's momentum magnitude is gamma_e m_e v_e = 4 * m_e * (c\u221a15)/4 = m_e c \u221a15.

Similarly, the positron has gamma_p=2, so v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/4) = c * sqrt(3)/2.\n\nTherefore, the momentum of the electron is gamma_e m v_e = 4 m * (c sqrt(15)/4) = m c sqrt(15) in the +x direction.\n\nThe positron's momentum is gamma_p m v_p, but since it's moving in the -x direction, it's - gamma_p m v_p.

Since each photon has energy E_photon = p_photon c, total energy is 2 p_photon c. \n\nSo energy before collision is (gamma_e + gamma_p) m_e c\u00b2 = 4 + 2 = 6 m_e c\u00b2. Therefore, 2 p_photon c = 6 m_e c\u00b2 => p_photon = 3 m_e c.\n\nSo p_photon is 3 m_e c.\n\nNow, the momentum equation:\n\n2 p_photon cos\u03b8 = p_e - p_p.",

The total momentum from the photons is p1 + p2. Let me represent their momenta as vectors. The problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So if we consider the coordinate system where the horizontal axis is the line of motion of the electron and positron (the x-axis), then upper-right would be in the +y direction, lower-right in the -y direction. So their momentum vectors would have components in x and y.\n\nLet me denote the angle of each photon with respect to the x-axis. Let's say photon 1 is at an angle \u03b8 above the x-axis (upper-right), and photon 2 is at angle \u03b8 below the x-axis (lower-right). So their momenta vectors are:\n\np1 = (p cos\u03b8, p sin\u03b8)\n\np2 = (p cos(-\u03b8), p sin(-\u03b8)) = (p cos\u03b8, -p sin\u03b8)\n\nSumming these gives total momentum after collision:\n\np_total = (2 p cos\u03b8, 0 )\n\nBecause the y-components cancel. The y-component is zero.\n\nSo the total momentum after collision is (2 p cos\u03b8, 0). This must equal the initial momentum, which was (m c (sqrt(3) - sqrt(15))).",

So the answer would be 2\u03b8, but I need to find what \u03b8 is.\n\nLet me think in terms of vectors. Let me denote the horizontal direction as the x-axis, and vertical as y. The initial momentum of the electron is p_e (since moving to the right) and the positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is -p_p. So total initial momentum is p_e - p_p. The photons each have momentum vectors. Let\u2019s call their momenta p_photon1 and p_photon2. Their sum must equal p_e - p_p.\n\nSince the photons have the same energy, their magnitudes are the same, let's call that p_photon (since p = E/c and E is same for both). The first photon is moving at angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, so its momentum components are p_photon * cos\u03b8 (x-component) and p_photon * sin\u03b8 (y-component). The second is moving at -\u03b8 below the x-axis, so its components are p_photon * cos\u03b8 and -p_photon * sin\u03b8. Adding these two, the y-components cancel.

Since they annihilate into two photons, the total energy is the sum of the photons' energies.

Since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), then v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2). So for the electron, v_e = c sqrt(1 - 1/(4)^2) = c sqrt(15/16) = (c)(\u221a15)/4. Similarly, for the positron with gamma 2, v_p = c sqrt(1 - 1/4) = c sqrt(3/4) = (c\u221a3)/2.\n\nThus, the electron's momentum magnitude is gamma_e m_e v_e = 4 * m_e * (c\u221a15)/4 = m_e c \u221a15. The positron's momentum is gamma_p m_e v_p = 2 * m_e * (c\u221a3)/2 = m_e c \u221a3.

Let me compute that numerically. \n\n\u221a15 \u2248 3.87298, \u221a3\u22481.73205. \n\nSo numerator: 3.87298 - 1.73205 \u2248 2.14093. \n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093 /6 \u2248 0.35682. \n\nSo cos\u03b8 \u2248 0.3568.

Let's see. \n\nLet me compute more precisely. \n\nLet me use a calculator-like approach. Let me think of cos\u03b8 = 0.3568. Let me find the angle:\n\nThe arccos of 0.3568 is approximately:\n\ncos(67\u00b0) \u2248 0.3907\n\ncos(68\u00b0) \u2248 0.3746\n\ncos(69\u00b0) \u2248 0.3584\n\nAh, 69 degrees is about 0.3584, which is very close to 0.3568. So \u03b8 is approximately 69 degrees. Since the question asks for the angle between the two photons, which is 2\u03b8. So 2*69 = 138 degrees. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138.

So the answer would be 2\u03b8, but I need to find what \u03b8 is.\n\nLet me think in terms of vectors. Let me denote the horizontal direction as the x-axis, and vertical as y. The initial momentum of the electron is p_e (since moving to the right) and the positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is -p_p. So total initial momentum is p_e - p_p. The photons each have momentum vectors. Let\u2019s call their momenta p_photon1 and p_photon2. Their sum must equal p_e - p_p.\n\nSince the photons have the same energy, their magnitudes are the same, let's call that p_photon (since p = E/c and E is same for both). The first photon is moving at angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, so its momentum components are p_photon * cos\u03b8 (x-component) and p_photon * sin\u03b8 (y-component). The second is moving at -\u03b8 below the x-axis, so its components are p_photon * cos\u03b8 and -p_photon * sin\u03b8. Adding these two, the y-components cancel.

Since they annihilate into two photons, the total energy is the sum of the photons' energies. Since each photon has energy E_photon = p_photon c, total energy is 2 p_photon c. \n\nSo energy before collision is (gamma_e + gamma_p) m_e c\u00b2 = 4 + 2 = 6 m_e c\u00b2.

Similarly, for the positron with gamma 2, v_p = c sqrt(1 - 1/4) = c sqrt(3/4) = (c\u221a3)/2.\n\nThus, the electron's momentum magnitude is gamma_e m_e v_e = 4 * m_e * (c\u221a15)/4 = m_e c \u221a15.

Similarly, the positron has gamma_p=2, so v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/4) = c * sqrt(3)/2.\n\nTherefore, the momentum of the electron is gamma_e m v_e = 4 m * (c sqrt(15)/4) = m c sqrt(15) in the +x direction.\n\nThe positron's momentum is gamma_p m v_p, but since it's moving in the -x direction, it's - gamma_p m v_p.

The initial momentum of the electron is p_e (since moving to the right) and the positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is -p_p. So total initial momentum is p_e - p_p. The photons each have momentum vectors. Let\u2019s call their momenta p_photon1 and p_photon2. Their sum must equal p_e - p_p.\n\nSince the photons have the same energy, their magnitudes are the same, let's call that p_photon (since p = E/c and E is same for both). The first photon is moving at angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, so its momentum components are p_photon * cos\u03b8 (x-component) and p_photon * sin\u03b8 (y-component). The second is moving at -\u03b8 below the x-axis, so its components are p_photon * cos\u03b8 and -p_photon * sin\u03b8. Adding these two, the y-components cancel. The x-components add up to 2 p_photon cos\u03b8. \n\nSo the total momentum after collision is 2 p_photon cos\u03b8 in the x-direction. This must equal the initial momentum (p_e - p_p). \n\nNow, energy conservation: the total energy before collision is the sum of the electron's energy and the positron's energy. Since they annihilate into two photons, the total energy is the sum of the photons' energies. Since each photon has energy E_photon = p_photon c, total energy is 2 p_photon c. \n\nSo energy before collision is (gamma_e + gamma_p) m_e c\u00b2 = 4 + 2 = 6 m_e c\u00b2. Therefore, 2 p_photon c = 6 m_e c\u00b2 => p_photon = 3 m_e c.\n\nSo p_photon is 3 m_e c.\n\nNow, the momentum equation:\n\n2 p_photon cos\u03b8 = p_e - p_p.",

Since their rest mass is the same (electron and positron have same mass), their total energy is 4m c\u00b2 and 2m c\u00b2 respectively. \n\nBut when they annihilate, they produce two photons. The problem states that the photons have equal energy and their directions are upper-right and lower-right. So both photons are moving to the right side but in opposite vertical directions. \n\nI need to find the angle between their directions. The angle between upper-right and lower-right would depend on their horizontal and vertical components. \n\nFirst, let's consider conservation of momentum.

Since they are moving in opposite directions, but their momenta are in opposite directions. So the total momentum will be the vector sum. Let me compute their energies first.\n\nThe energy of a particle with gamma is E = gamma * m c\u00b2. Since it's an electron and positron, their rest masses are equal. Let me assume the mass is m (since the actual value might not matter as things might cancel). \n\nSo electron energy: E_e = 4 m c\u00b2, positron energy E_p = 2 m c\u00b2.

The horizontal components are both 3 m_e c cos\u03b8. So the total momentum in x-direction is 2 * 3 m_e c cos\u03b8 = 6 m_e c cos\u03b8. \n\nThis must equal the initial momentum in the x-direction, which was m_e c (\u221a15 - \u221a3).

The total momentum after collision must equal the initial momentum of (m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))) in the x-direction. \n\nSince the two photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions, their y-components cancel (as before). The x-components add up. Let me define the angle each photon makes with the x-axis. Let \u03b8 be the angle above the x-axis for the upper-right photon, and -\u03b8 for the lower-right one (so symmetric about the x-axis). \n\nThe momentum components would be:\n\nPhoton 1 (upper-right): (p cos\u03b8, p sin\u03b8)\n\nPhoton 2 (lower-right): (p cos\u03b8, - p sin\u03b8)\n\nSum of momenta: (2p cos\u03b8, 0). So the total momentum is 2p cos\u03b8 in the x-direction. This must equal the initial momentum's x-component, which is m c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ).\n\nAdditionally, the total energy before collision must equal the total energy after collision. \n\nThe total initial energy is the sum of the electron and positron's energies:\n\nE_initial = E_e + E_p = \u03b3_e m c\u00b2 + \u03b3_p m c\u00b2 = (4 + 2) m c\u00b2 =6 m c\u00b2.\n\nAfter annihilation, the total energy is the sum of the two photons' energies, which are each E_photon = p c (since E = pc for photons). Since there are two photons, total energy is 2 p c. \n\nTherefore, 2 p c =6 m c\u00b2 \u2192 p = 3 m c.\n\nSo the magnitude of each photon's momentum is 3 m c. \n\nNow, going back to the momentum equation:\n\n2 p cos\u03b8 = m c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )\n\nSubstituting p=3 m c:\n\n2*(3 m c)*cos\u03b8 = m c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )\n\nDivide both sides by m c:\n\n6 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)\n\nThus,\n\ncos\u03b8 = ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ) /6 \n\nLet me compute that value numerically:\n\nsqrt(15) \u22483.87298\n\nsqrt(3)\u22481.73205\n\nSubtract: 3.87298 -1.73205 \u22482.14093\n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093 /6 \u22480.3568\n\nSo cos\u03b8 \u22480.3568 \u2192 \u03b8 \u2248acos(0.3568).

So:\n\np_p = - \u03b3_p m ( (sqrt(3)/2)c ) = -2 * m * (sqrt(3)/2 c ) = - m c sqrt(3).\n\nThus total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e + p_p = m c sqrt(15) - m c sqrt(3) = m c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ). Since sqrt(15)\u22483.872 and sqrt(3)\u22481.732, so sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)\u22482.14, so total momentum is positive, meaning to the right. \n\nSo the total momentum after collision must also be to the right. \n\nNow, the photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions. Let me think of their momentum vectors.\n\nAssuming both photons have the same energy, so their momentum magnitudes are equal. Let me denote each photon's momentum magnitude as p. The total momentum after collision must equal the initial momentum of (m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))) in the x-direction. \n\nSince the two photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions, their y-components cancel (as before). The x-components add up. Let me define the angle each photon makes with the x-axis. Let \u03b8 be the angle above the x-axis for the upper-right photon, and -\u03b8 for the lower-right one (so symmetric about the x-axis). \n\nThe momentum components would be:\n\nPhoton 1 (upper-right): (p cos\u03b8, p sin\u03b8)\n\nPhoton 2 (lower-right): (p cos\u03b8, - p sin\u03b8)\n\nSum of momenta: (2p cos\u03b8, 0). So the total momentum is 2p cos\u03b8 in the x-direction. This must equal the initial momentum's x-component, which is m c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ).\n\nAdditionally, the total energy before collision must equal the total energy after collision. \n\nThe total initial energy is the sum of the electron and positron's energies:\n\nE_initial = E_e + E_p = \u03b3_e m c\u00b2 + \u03b3_p m c\u00b2 = (4 + 2) m c\u00b2 =6 m c\u00b2.\n\nAfter annihilation, the total energy is the sum of the two photons' energies, which are each E_photon = p c (since E = pc for photons). Since there are two photons, total energy is 2 p c. \n\nTherefore, 2 p c =6 m c\u00b2 \u2192 p = 3 m c.\n\nSo the magnitude of each photon's momentum is 3 m c. \n\nNow, going back to the momentum equation:\n\n2 p cos\u03b8 = m c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )\n\nSubstituting p=3 m c:\n\n2*(3 m c)*cos\u03b8 = m c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )\n\nDivide both sides by m c:\n\n6 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)\n\nThus,\n\ncos\u03b8 = ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ) /6 \n\nLet me compute that value numerically:\n\nsqrt(15) \u22483.87298\n\nsqrt(3)\u22481.73205\n\nSubtract: 3.87298 -1.73205 \u22482.14093\n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093 /6 \u22480.3568\n\nSo cos\u03b8 \u22480.3568 \u2192 \u03b8 \u2248acos(0.3568).

Since v_e = sqrt(15)/4 c. So plugging that in: \n\np_e =4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4)c = m_e c sqrt(15). \n\nThe positron's velocity is v_p = sqrt(3)/2 c, but direction left, so momentum is negative. So p_p = - gamma_p m_e v_p. \n\ngamma_p is 2, so p_p = -2 * m_e*(sqrt(3)/2 c) = - m_e c sqrt(3). \n\nTotal momentum is p_e + p_p = m_e c sqrt(15) - m_e c sqrt(3). \n\nHmm, sqrt(15) is about 3.872, sqrt(3) is about 1.732.
