The problem states this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when T decreases, the ratio n1/n2 decreases.\n\nBut according to the equation:\n\nn1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(\u0394E/(k T) )\n\nSo if T decreases, the exponent increases, so n1/n2 increases. Which contradicts the observation.\n\nSo that can't be right. Therefore, perhaps I'm getting the ratio wrong. Maybe the observed ratio is n2/n1, which is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp( -\u0394E/(k T) )\n\nIn that case, when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp(...) becomes smaller.
