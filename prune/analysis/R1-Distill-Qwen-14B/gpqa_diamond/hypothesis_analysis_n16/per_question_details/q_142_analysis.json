When expanded, that would be:\n\n\u03c1 = (1/2) [ [1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y], [r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z] ]\n\nSo, comparing this with the given \u03c1, which is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2.\n\nLet me compute the given \u03c1. |0><0| is [[1, 0], [0, 0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0], [0,1]]. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], and then multiplying by 1/2, we get [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].\n\nSo \u03c1 is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements 1/2. Now, let's compare this with the general form for \u03c1 in terms of the Bloch vector.\n\nThe general form after expansion is:\n\n\u03c1 = (1/2) [ [1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y], [r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z] ]\n\nComparing this to the given \u03c1:\n\nThe diagonal elements are (1 + r_z)/2 and (1 - r_z)/2. In our case, both diagonal elements are 1/2. So setting them equal:\n\n(1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 \u2192 1 + r_z = 1 \u2192 r_z = 0.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - r_z)/2 = 1/2 \u2192 same result, r_z=0.\n\nNow, what about the off-diagonal elements? The given \u03c1 has zeros in the off-diagonal. The general form's off-diagonal elements are (r_x - i r_y)/2 and (r_x + i r_y)/2.\n\nSo for the given \u03c1, the off-diagonal terms are 0. So:\n\n(r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0 \u2192 r_x = 0 and r_y = 0.\n\nBecause real and imaginary parts must be zero. So r_x =0, r_y=0, and r_z=0. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0).",
