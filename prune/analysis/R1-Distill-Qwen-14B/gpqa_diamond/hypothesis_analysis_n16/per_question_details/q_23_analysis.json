Let me try another angle. \n\nThe question states that after reaction with HBr, two products are formed. The reactant is an ether with an alkene (double bond) in the side chain. \n\nPossible reactions:\n\n1. Addition of HBr across the double bond, leading to two different regioisomers (if the addition can occur in two ways). But usually, addition follows Markovnikov, leading to a single major product. Unless there's a possibility of 1,2-hydride shift or similar, leading to a different carbocation position, hence two products.\n\n2. Acid-catalyzed cleavage of the ether to form phenol and a bromide, with possible rearrangement of the carbocation leading to different products.\n\n3. Elimination reaction (losing water) to form an alkene, but that would require a dehydrobromination, which might not fit with HBr.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption B has two products where one has a bromo group and the other has a different double bond location.

For example, if the carbocation can form a more stable carbocation by moving a hydrogen from an adjacent carbon, that would happen.
