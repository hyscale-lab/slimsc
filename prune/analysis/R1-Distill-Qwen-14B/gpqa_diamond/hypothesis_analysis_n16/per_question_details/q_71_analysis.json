So T^4 is proportional to F, so T proportional to (F)^{1/4} = (L/(4\u03c0a\u00b2))^{1/4} * (1/(1 - albedo))^{1/4} (if albedo is factored in).

So maybe I can ignore the albedo here since it's the same for both. \n\nTherefore, the equilibrium temperature ratio squared (since T is proportional to (1/a)^0.5) would depend on the inverse square root of the semi-major axis ratio.

So P^2 \u221d a^3. Since all the planets are orbiting the same star, the proportionality constant is the same, so (P1/P2)^2 = (a1/a2)^3.

So when you divide T4 by T2, you get (1/sqrt(a4)) / (1/sqrt(a2)) ) = sqrt(a2/a4). \n\nTherefore, to find this ratio, I need the ratio of their orbital distances a2/a4. \n\nNow, how do I find their orbital distances? Since the orbital periods are given in a ratio. The question states the orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for the planets 1 to 5. So Planet_2 has period P2 = 2 units, Planet_4 has P4 = 3.5 units. \n\nKepler's third law states that (P^2)/(a^3) is constant for all planets around the same star. So P^2 proportional to a^3. Therefore, a is proportional to P^(2/3). \n\nTherefore, the ratio a2/a4 would be (P2/P4)^(2/3). \n\nCalculating that: P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5. So P2/P4 = 2/3.5 = 4/7 \u2248 0.5714. \n\nTaking that to the power 2/3: (4/7)^(2/3). Let me compute that. Let me see, 4 is 2^2, 7 is prime. \n\nLet me compute (4/7)^(2/3).

Since L and (1 - A) are the same for all planets, the temperature is proportional to (1/a)^{1/2}. So T1 proportional to 1/sqrt(a1), T2 proportional to 1/sqrt(a2), etc. So T4 / T2 = (1/sqrt(a4)) / (1/sqrt(a2)) ) = sqrt( a2 / a4 ). So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the ratio is sqrt( a2 / a4 ). \n\nNow, how do I get the ratio of the orbital distances? Kepler's third law says that (a^3)/(P^2) = constant for a system orbiting the same star. So a^3 proportional to P^2. So the ratio of a4/a2 would be ( (P4 / P2)^2 )^(1/3).",

So P^2 \u221d a^3. Since all the planets are orbiting the same star, the proportionality constant is the same, so (P1/P2)^2 = (a1/a2)^3. Therefore, the ratio of semi-major axes (a4/a2) would be (P4/P2)^(2/3). \n\nThe given orbital period ratios are 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_2 has a period of 2 units (since the ratio is 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, so Planet_1 is 1, Planet_2 is 2, Planet_4 is 3.5). So the ratio of P4/P2 is 3.5/2 = 1.75. \n\nSo a4/a2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3).
