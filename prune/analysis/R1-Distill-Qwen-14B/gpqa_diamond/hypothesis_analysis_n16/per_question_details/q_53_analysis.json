A benzene ring normally has 6 H's. If it's disubstituted, the number of unique proton environments depends on the substituent positions. Let's say substituents are in the para positions. Then, the remaining four H's would be in two equivalent pairs (like in 1,4-disubstituted benzene), leading to two signals for the aromatic H's. That matches the two signals mentioned. So that's possible.\n\nNow the substituents. The ester group must be one of the substituents. The other substituent would be another group that doesn't introduce any CH2 groups. Let's think of possible substituents that contain vinyl and CH3 groups without CH2.",

Hmm, the question says \"presence of an ester group\"\u2014so maybe only one ester group. So one substituent is the ester.\n\nSo, one substituent is the ester group (like -COOR) and the other substituent is something else. Let's see what the other substituent needs to contribute.\n\nThe NMR shows:\n\n- Two aromatic-H signals.\n\n- Two vinyl-H signals (each with different multiplicities).\n\n- Two CH3 signals.\n\nAnd no CH2 groups. So the other substituent must incorporate the vinyl groups and the methyl groups, but without any CH2.\n\nLet me try to think of a substituent that has vinyl (double bond) and methyl groups but no CH2. For example, maybe a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, forming a propene group? Like CH2=CH-CH3.",
          "text2": "Wait, but the NMR says there are no -CH2 groups. So that would be a problem. Therefore, the ester must not have any CH2 groups. So the R group in the ester must be a methyl group? Like -COOCH3. Because that way, the ester is -OCOCH3, which has a methyl group, so no CH2. That would be okay.\n\nThen the other substituent: The other substituent must account for the vinyl-H and the -CH3 groups. Let me see. The vinyl-H comes from a double bond. Let's see, if the other substituent is a vinyl group connected to a methyl group, like CH2CH2?",
