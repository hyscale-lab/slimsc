The H on C3 would be coupled to the CH3's protons (J?), and to the H on C2 (which is part of the double bond). \n\nTherefore, the H's on C1 (two H's) are coupled to the H on C2 (J=16), making them a triplet. Additionally, if they are also coupled to another proton (like the H on C3?), that could give a quartet. Hence, the 5.5 peak (the triplet from C1's H's) plus another coupling could make it a dq. \n\nPutting this all together, the structure would be cis-butenyl acetate (option A), since the groups are arranged in a cis configuration.",

The dq at 5.5 and the doublet at 7.0 with J=16 likely indicate a vinyl proton and another proton adjacent to the double bond with two couplings. \n\nThe presence of a methyl at 1.6 suggests it's attached to a CH group. \n\nBetween the options, trans-butenyl acetate (D) might have the necessary methyl and the dq.",
