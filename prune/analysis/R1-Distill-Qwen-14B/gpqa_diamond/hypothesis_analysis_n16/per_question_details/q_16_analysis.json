The (E) configuration refers to a double bond. The (3aR,7aS) are stereochemical descriptors for the ring positions. Since there are multiple chiral centers (the R and S), but also the E configuration. However, the question is about optical activity. If the molecule has any chiral centers or is asymmetric, then it would be optically active.

So first compound: not optically active.\n\nSecond compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Hmm, this looks complicated. The name includes a lot of substituents and maybe a bridged ring system. The presence of '3aR' and '7aS' suggests that there are chiral centers (or at least stereocenters) at positions 3a and 7a, but the exact structure is hard to visualize. The (E) denotes a double bond configuration. However, even if there are chiral centers (like 3a and 7a), we have to check if the molecule is chiral. Since it has multiple stereocenters, unless it's a meso compound, it would be chiral. But without knowing if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's hard to say. But the name includes R and S configurations, which are assigned to different centers. If they are in different configurations and the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral. Since the question is about optical activity, and the presence of stereocenters with different configurations (R and S) suggests that unless there's a symmetry leading to meso, this would be optically active. But I'm not sure about the exact structure here. Let me think differently: the presence of stereocenters with different configurations (like R and S) and no symmetry would mean the molecule is chiral. Since the compound has two chiral centers (3a and 7a), and the configuration is R and S, unless they are symmetrically placed, which would make it a meso compound. But the positions are 3a and 7a, which might not be symmetric. The (E) isomer of a double bond doesn't contribute to chirality, but the configuration of the stereocenters does. So if the molecule isn't symmetric, then it would be chiral, hence optically active. So I think this compound is optically active. So second compound: yes.\n\nThird compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. The 2,3-dimethyl would add methyl groups to carbons 2 and 3.

However, the presence of the R and S notations here suggests that these bridgehead atoms are indeed chiral centers. Additionally, the E configuration refers to a double bond, so maybe there's another chiral center. But the main point is, since the compound has both 3aR and 7aS configurations, that implies that those bridgehead atoms are chiral and have different configurations. Since both are present with different configurations, the compound must be chiral (as a mixture?), but the question is whether the compound is optically active. If the compound has a chiral center, then it would be optically active unless it's a meso compound. But since it's specified with R and S configurations on different bridgeheads, and given the structure, it might not have a plane of symmetry. So this compound is likely optically active. So count this as one.\n\nThird compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Adding methyl groups on carbons 2 and 3 (the middle carbons).

Hence, this would be a meso form, so it's not optically active. Therefore, fourth compound: no.\n\nFifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. Let's analyze. The molecule has a cyclohexene ring (3-en means the double bond between carbons 3 and 4?), and an -OH group on carbon 1. The (R) configuration indicates a chiral center. The chiral center is at carbon 1. Let's see if that carbon has four different substituents. The structure is cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. The hydroxyl group is on C1. The ring is cyclohexane with a double bond between C3 and C4. The carbon at position 1 (where the OH is) is connected to the ring, so its substituents would be:\n\n- The hydroxyl group (OH),\n\n- three other groups. Depending on the numbering, the other substituents would be parts of the ring.",
          "text2": "Wait, perhaps in this case, the compound is a meso form, so it's not optically active. Because in (2R,3S) it's chiral, but (2R,3R) would have a plane of symmetry. Let me think: the two chiral centers are adjacent, and if their configurations are the same (R,R), then the molecule is symmetric. For example, in tartaric acid, the (R,R) and (S,S) forms are meso. So similarly, here, if the 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid with (R,R) would be a meso compound, so no optical activity. So this one might not be optically active.\n\nFifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol.

The (E) configuration refers to a double bond. The (3aR,7aS) are stereochemical descriptors for the ring positions. Since there are multiple chiral centers (the R and S), but also the E configuration. However, the question is about optical activity. If the molecule has any chiral centers or is asymmetric, then it would be optically active.

So first compound: not optically active.\n\nSecond compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Hmm, this looks complicated. The name includes a lot of substituents and maybe a bridged ring system. The presence of '3aR' and '7aS' suggests that there are chiral centers (or at least stereocenters) at positions 3a and 7a, but the exact structure is hard to visualize. The (E) denotes a double bond configuration. However, even if there are chiral centers (like 3a and 7a), we have to check if the molecule is chiral. Since it has multiple stereocenters, unless it's a meso compound, it would be chiral. But without knowing if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's hard to say. But the name includes R and S configurations, which are assigned to different centers. If they are in different configurations and the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral. Since the question is about optical activity, and the presence of stereocenters with different configurations (R and S) suggests that unless there's a symmetry leading to meso, this would be optically active. But I'm not sure about the exact structure here. Let me think differently: the presence of stereocenters with different configurations (like R and S) and no symmetry would mean the molecule is chiral. Since the compound has two chiral centers (3a and 7a), and the configuration is R and S, unless they are symmetrically placed, which would make it a meso compound. But the positions are 3a and 7a, which might not be symmetric. The (E) isomer of a double bond doesn't contribute to chirality, but the configuration of the stereocenters does. So if the molecule isn't symmetric, then it would be chiral, hence optically active. So I think this compound is optically active. So second compound: yes.\n\nThird compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. The 2,3-dimethyl would add methyl groups to carbons 2 and 3.

However, the presence of the R and S notations here suggests that these bridgehead atoms are indeed chiral centers. Additionally, the E configuration refers to a double bond, so maybe there's another chiral center. But the main point is, since the compound has both 3aR and 7aS configurations, that implies that those bridgehead atoms are chiral and have different configurations. Since both are present with different configurations, the compound must be chiral (as a mixture?), but the question is whether the compound is optically active. If the compound has a chiral center, then it would be optically active unless it's a meso compound. But since it's specified with R and S configurations on different bridgeheads, and given the structure, it might not have a plane of symmetry. So this compound is likely optically active. So count this as one.\n\nThird compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Adding methyl groups on carbons 2 and 3 (the middle carbons).

The (E) configuration refers to a double bond. The (3aR,7aS) are stereochemical descriptors for the ring positions. Since there are multiple chiral centers (the R and S), but also the E configuration. However, the question is about optical activity. If the molecule has any chiral centers or is asymmetric, then it would be optically active.

The name includes a lot of substituents and maybe a bridged ring system. The presence of '3aR' and '7aS' suggests that there are chiral centers (or at least stereocenters) at positions 3a and 7a, but the exact structure is hard to visualize. The (E) denotes a double bond configuration. However, even if there are chiral centers (like 3a and 7a), we have to check if the molecule is chiral. Since it has multiple stereocenters, unless it's a meso compound, it would be chiral. But without knowing if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's hard to say. But the name includes R and S configurations, which are assigned to different centers. If they are in different configurations and the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral. Since the question is about optical activity, and the presence of stereocenters with different configurations (R and S) suggests that unless there's a symmetry leading to meso, this would be optically active. But I'm not sure about the exact structure here. Let me think differently: the presence of stereocenters with different configurations (like R and S) and no symmetry would mean the molecule is chiral. Since the compound has two chiral centers (3a and 7a), and the configuration is R and S, unless they are symmetrically placed, which would make it a meso compound. But the positions are 3a and 7a, which might not be symmetric. The (E) isomer of a double bond doesn't contribute to chirality, but the configuration of the stereocenters does. So if the molecule isn't symmetric, then it would be chiral, hence optically active. So I think this compound is optically active.

However, the presence of the R and S notations here suggests that these bridgehead atoms are indeed chiral centers. Additionally, the E configuration refers to a double bond, so maybe there's another chiral center. But the main point is, since the compound has both 3aR and 7aS configurations, that implies that those bridgehead atoms are chiral and have different configurations. Since both are present with different configurations, the compound must be chiral (as a mixture?), but the question is whether the compound is optically active. If the compound has a chiral center, then it would be optically active unless it's a meso compound. But since it's specified with R and S configurations on different bridgeheads, and given the structure, it might not have a plane of symmetry. So this compound is likely optically active.

But regardless, if the carbon with the OH has four different groups, then it's chiral. Let's assume that the other groups around C1 are different. Since it's labeled (R), that means it's a chiral center, so the compound is optically active.",

Otherwise not.\n\nMoving on to the second compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Wow, that's a complicated name. Let me try to parse this. The name includes several components. The (E) indicates an E isomer for some double bond (maybe the one at position 8?), but that's geometric isomerism. The (3aR,7aS) suggests that there are two stereocenters at positions 3a and 7a. Since they have different configurations (R and S), this molecule is a chiral molecule.

So first compound: not optically active.\n\nSecond compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Hmm, this looks complicated. The name includes a lot of substituents and maybe a bridged ring system. The presence of '3aR' and '7aS' suggests that there are chiral centers (or at least stereocenters) at positions 3a and 7a, but the exact structure is hard to visualize. The (E) denotes a double bond configuration. However, even if there are chiral centers (like 3a and 7a), we have to check if the molecule is chiral. Since it has multiple stereocenters, unless it's a meso compound, it would be chiral. But without knowing if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's hard to say. But the name includes R and S configurations, which are assigned to different centers. If they are in different configurations and the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral. Since the question is about optical activity, and the presence of stereocenters with different configurations (R and S) suggests that unless there's a symmetry leading to meso, this would be optically active. But I'm not sure about the exact structure here. Let me think differently: the presence of stereocenters with different configurations (like R and S) and no symmetry would mean the molecule is chiral. Since the compound has two chiral centers (3a and 7a), and the configuration is R and S, unless they are symmetrically placed, which would make it a meso compound. But the positions are 3a and 7a, which might not be symmetric. The (E) isomer of a double bond doesn't contribute to chirality, but the configuration of the stereocenters does. So if the molecule isn't symmetric, then it would be chiral, hence optically active. So I think this compound is optically active. So second compound: yes.\n\nThird compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. The 2,3-dimethyl would add methyl groups to carbons 2 and 3.

The (E) configuration refers to a double bond. The (3aR,7aS) are stereochemical descriptors for the ring positions. Since there are multiple chiral centers (the R and S), but also the E configuration. However, the question is about optical activity. If the molecule has any chiral centers or is asymmetric, then it would be optically active.

So first compound: not optically active.\n\nSecond compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Hmm, this looks complicated. The name includes a lot of substituents and maybe a bridged ring system. The presence of '3aR' and '7aS' suggests that there are chiral centers (or at least stereocenters) at positions 3a and 7a, but the exact structure is hard to visualize. The (E) denotes a double bond configuration. However, even if there are chiral centers (like 3a and 7a), we have to check if the molecule is chiral. Since it has multiple stereocenters, unless it's a meso compound, it would be chiral. But without knowing if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's hard to say. But the name includes R and S configurations, which are assigned to different centers. If they are in different configurations and the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral. Since the question is about optical activity, and the presence of stereocenters with different configurations (R and S) suggests that unless there's a symmetry leading to meso, this would be optically active. But I'm not sure about the exact structure here. Let me think differently: the presence of stereocenters with different configurations (like R and S) and no symmetry would mean the molecule is chiral. Since the compound has two chiral centers (3a and 7a), and the configuration is R and S, unless they are symmetrically placed, which would make it a meso compound. But the positions are 3a and 7a, which might not be symmetric. The (E) isomer of a double bond doesn't contribute to chirality, but the configuration of the stereocenters does. So if the molecule isn't symmetric, then it would be chiral, hence optically active. So I think this compound is optically active. So second compound: yes.\n\nThird compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. The 2,3-dimethyl would add methyl groups to carbons 2 and 3.

However, the presence of the R and S notations here suggests that these bridgehead atoms are indeed chiral centers. Additionally, the E configuration refers to a double bond, so maybe there's another chiral center. But the main point is, since the compound has both 3aR and 7aS configurations, that implies that those bridgehead atoms are chiral and have different configurations. Since both are present with different configurations, the compound must be chiral (as a mixture?), but the question is whether the compound is optically active. If the compound has a chiral center, then it would be optically active unless it's a meso compound. But since it's specified with R and S configurations on different bridgeheads, and given the structure, it might not have a plane of symmetry. So this compound is likely optically active.

The (3aR,7aS) suggests that there are two stereocenters at positions 3a and 7a. Since they have different configurations (R and S), this molecule is a chiral molecule.

So first compound: not optically active.\n\nSecond compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Hmm, this looks complicated. The name includes a lot of substituents and maybe a bridged ring system. The presence of '3aR' and '7aS' suggests that there are chiral centers (or at least stereocenters) at positions 3a and 7a, but the exact structure is hard to visualize. The (E) denotes a double bond configuration. However, even if there are chiral centers (like 3a and 7a), we have to check if the molecule is chiral. Since it has multiple stereocenters, unless it's a meso compound, it would be chiral. But without knowing if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's hard to say. But the name includes R and S configurations, which are assigned to different centers. If they are in different configurations and the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral. Since the question is about optical activity, and the presence of stereocenters with different configurations (R and S) suggests that unless there's a symmetry leading to meso, this would be optically active. But I'm not sure about the exact structure here. Let me think differently: the presence of stereocenters with different configurations (like R and S) and no symmetry would mean the molecule is chiral. Since the compound has two chiral centers (3a and 7a), and the configuration is R and S, unless they are symmetrically placed, which would make it a meso compound. But the positions are 3a and 7a, which might not be symmetric. The (E) isomer of a double bond doesn't contribute to chirality, but the configuration of the stereocenters does. So if the molecule isn't symmetric, then it would be chiral, hence optically active. So I think this compound is optically active. So second compound: yes.\n\nThird compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. The 2,3-dimethyl would add methyl groups to carbons 2 and 3.

The (E) configuration refers to a double bond. The (3aR,7aS) are stereochemical descriptors for the ring positions. Since there are multiple chiral centers (the R and S), but also the E configuration. However, the question is about optical activity. If the molecule has any chiral centers or is asymmetric, then it would be optically active.

So first compound: not optically active.\n\nSecond compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Hmm, this looks complicated. The name includes a lot of substituents and maybe a bridged ring system. The presence of '3aR' and '7aS' suggests that there are chiral centers (or at least stereocenters) at positions 3a and 7a, but the exact structure is hard to visualize. The (E) denotes a double bond configuration. However, even if there are chiral centers (like 3a and 7a), we have to check if the molecule is chiral. Since it has multiple stereocenters, unless it's a meso compound, it would be chiral. But without knowing if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's hard to say. But the name includes R and S configurations, which are assigned to different centers. If they are in different configurations and the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral. Since the question is about optical activity, and the presence of stereocenters with different configurations (R and S) suggests that unless there's a symmetry leading to meso, this would be optically active. But I'm not sure about the exact structure here. Let me think differently: the presence of stereocenters with different configurations (like R and S) and no symmetry would mean the molecule is chiral. Since the compound has two chiral centers (3a and 7a), and the configuration is R and S, unless they are symmetrically placed, which would make it a meso compound. But the positions are 3a and 7a, which might not be symmetric. The (E) isomer of a double bond doesn't contribute to chirality, but the configuration of the stereocenters does. So if the molecule isn't symmetric, then it would be chiral, hence optically active. So I think this compound is optically active. So second compound: yes.\n\nThird compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. The 2,3-dimethyl would add methyl groups to carbons 2 and 3.

However, the presence of the R and S notations here suggests that these bridgehead atoms are indeed chiral centers. Additionally, the E configuration refers to a double bond, so maybe there's another chiral center. But the main point is, since the compound has both 3aR and 7aS configurations, that implies that those bridgehead atoms are chiral and have different configurations. Since both are present with different configurations, the compound must be chiral (as a mixture?), but the question is whether the compound is optically active. If the compound has a chiral center, then it would be optically active unless it's a meso compound. But since it's specified with R and S configurations on different bridgeheads, and given the structure, it might not have a plane of symmetry. So this compound is likely optically active. So count this as one.\n\nThird compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Adding methyl groups on carbons 2 and 3 (the middle carbons).

Since it has multiple stereocenters, unless it's a meso compound, it would be chiral. But without knowing if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's hard to say. But the name includes R and S configurations, which are assigned to different centers. If they are in different configurations and the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral. Since the question is about optical activity, and the presence of stereocenters with different configurations (R and S) suggests that unless there's a symmetry leading to meso, this would be optically active.

Because if you have both R configurations, then reflecting the molecule over the plane between the two centers would make it superimposable on its mirror image. Hence, this would be a meso form, so it's not optically active. Therefore, fourth compound: no.\n\nFifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. Let's analyze. The molecule has a cyclohexene ring (3-en means the double bond between carbons 3 and 4?), and an -OH group on carbon 1. The (R) configuration indicates a chiral center. The chiral center is at carbon 1. Let's see if that carbon has four different substituents. The structure is cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. The hydroxyl group is on C1. The ring is cyclohexane with a double bond between C3 and C4. The carbon at position 1 (where the OH is) is connected to the ring, so its substituents would be:\n\n- The hydroxyl group (OH),\n\n- three other groups. Depending on the numbering, the other substituents would be parts of the ring.",
          "text2": "Wait, perhaps in this case, the compound is a meso form, so it's not optically active. Because in (2R,3S) it's chiral, but (2R,3R) would have a plane of symmetry. Let me think: the two chiral centers are adjacent, and if their configurations are the same (R,R), then the molecule is symmetric. For example, in tartaric acid, the (R,R) and (S,S) forms are meso. So similarly, here, if the 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid with (R,R) would be a meso compound, so no optical activity. So this one might not be optically active.\n\nFifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol.

The (E) configuration refers to a double bond. The (3aR,7aS) are stereochemical descriptors for the ring positions. Since there are multiple chiral centers (the R and S), but also the E configuration. However, the question is about optical activity. If the molecule has any chiral centers or is asymmetric, then it would be optically active.

So first compound: not optically active.\n\nSecond compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Hmm, this looks complicated. The name includes a lot of substituents and maybe a bridged ring system. The presence of '3aR' and '7aS' suggests that there are chiral centers (or at least stereocenters) at positions 3a and 7a, but the exact structure is hard to visualize. The (E) denotes a double bond configuration. However, even if there are chiral centers (like 3a and 7a), we have to check if the molecule is chiral. Since it has multiple stereocenters, unless it's a meso compound, it would be chiral. But without knowing if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's hard to say. But the name includes R and S configurations, which are assigned to different centers. If they are in different configurations and the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral. Since the question is about optical activity, and the presence of stereocenters with different configurations (R and S) suggests that unless there's a symmetry leading to meso, this would be optically active. But I'm not sure about the exact structure here. Let me think differently: the presence of stereocenters with different configurations (like R and S) and no symmetry would mean the molecule is chiral. Since the compound has two chiral centers (3a and 7a), and the configuration is R and S, unless they are symmetrically placed, which would make it a meso compound. But the positions are 3a and 7a, which might not be symmetric. The (E) isomer of a double bond doesn't contribute to chirality, but the configuration of the stereocenters does. So if the molecule isn't symmetric, then it would be chiral, hence optically active. So I think this compound is optically active. So second compound: yes.\n\nThird compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. The 2,3-dimethyl would add methyl groups to carbons 2 and 3.

However, the presence of the R and S notations here suggests that these bridgehead atoms are indeed chiral centers. Additionally, the E configuration refers to a double bond, so maybe there's another chiral center. But the main point is, since the compound has both 3aR and 7aS configurations, that implies that those bridgehead atoms are chiral and have different configurations. Since both are present with different configurations, the compound must be chiral (as a mixture?), but the question is whether the compound is optically active. If the compound has a chiral center, then it would be optically active unless it's a meso compound. But since it's specified with R and S configurations on different bridgeheads, and given the structure, it might not have a plane of symmetry. So this compound is likely optically active. So count this as one.\n\nThird compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Adding methyl groups on carbons 2 and 3 (the middle carbons).

The (E) configuration refers to a double bond. The (3aR,7aS) are stereochemical descriptors for the ring positions. Since there are multiple chiral centers (the R and S), but also the E configuration. However, the question is about optical activity. If the molecule has any chiral centers or is asymmetric, then it would be optically active.

The name includes a lot of substituents and maybe a bridged ring system. The presence of '3aR' and '7aS' suggests that there are chiral centers (or at least stereocenters) at positions 3a and 7a, but the exact structure is hard to visualize. The (E) denotes a double bond configuration. However, even if there are chiral centers (like 3a and 7a), we have to check if the molecule is chiral. Since it has multiple stereocenters, unless it's a meso compound, it would be chiral. But without knowing if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's hard to say. But the name includes R and S configurations, which are assigned to different centers. If they are in different configurations and the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral. Since the question is about optical activity, and the presence of stereocenters with different configurations (R and S) suggests that unless there's a symmetry leading to meso, this would be optically active. But I'm not sure about the exact structure here. Let me think differently: the presence of stereocenters with different configurations (like R and S) and no symmetry would mean the molecule is chiral. Since the compound has two chiral centers (3a and 7a), and the configuration is R and S, unless they are symmetrically placed, which would make it a meso compound. But the positions are 3a and 7a, which might not be symmetric. The (E) isomer of a double bond doesn't contribute to chirality, but the configuration of the stereocenters does. So if the molecule isn't symmetric, then it would be chiral, hence optically active. So I think this compound is optically active.

However, the presence of the R and S notations here suggests that these bridgehead atoms are indeed chiral centers. Additionally, the E configuration refers to a double bond, so maybe there's another chiral center. But the main point is, since the compound has both 3aR and 7aS configurations, that implies that those bridgehead atoms are chiral and have different configurations. Since both are present with different configurations, the compound must be chiral (as a mixture?), but the question is whether the compound is optically active. If the compound has a chiral center, then it would be optically active unless it's a meso compound. But since it's specified with R and S configurations on different bridgeheads, and given the structure, it might not have a plane of symmetry. So this compound is likely optically active.

The name includes several components. The (E) indicates an E isomer for some double bond (maybe the one at position 8?), but that's geometric isomerism. The (3aR,7aS) suggests that there are two stereocenters at positions 3a and 7a. Since they have different configurations (R and S), this molecule is a chiral molecule.

So first compound: not optically active.\n\nSecond compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Hmm, this looks complicated. The name includes a lot of substituents and maybe a bridged ring system. The presence of '3aR' and '7aS' suggests that there are chiral centers (or at least stereocenters) at positions 3a and 7a, but the exact structure is hard to visualize. The (E) denotes a double bond configuration. However, even if there are chiral centers (like 3a and 7a), we have to check if the molecule is chiral. Since it has multiple stereocenters, unless it's a meso compound, it would be chiral. But without knowing if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's hard to say. But the name includes R and S configurations, which are assigned to different centers. If they are in different configurations and the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral. Since the question is about optical activity, and the presence of stereocenters with different configurations (R and S) suggests that unless there's a symmetry leading to meso, this would be optically active. But I'm not sure about the exact structure here. Let me think differently: the presence of stereocenters with different configurations (like R and S) and no symmetry would mean the molecule is chiral. Since the compound has two chiral centers (3a and 7a), and the configuration is R and S, unless they are symmetrically placed, which would make it a meso compound. But the positions are 3a and 7a, which might not be symmetric. The (E) isomer of a double bond doesn't contribute to chirality, but the configuration of the stereocenters does. So if the molecule isn't symmetric, then it would be chiral, hence optically active. So I think this compound is optically active. So second compound: yes.\n\nThird compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. The 2,3-dimethyl would add methyl groups to carbons 2 and 3.

The (E) configuration refers to a double bond. The (3aR,7aS) are stereochemical descriptors for the ring positions. Since there are multiple chiral centers (the R and S), but also the E configuration. However, the question is about optical activity. If the molecule has any chiral centers or is asymmetric, then it would be optically active.

The name includes a lot of substituents and maybe a bridged ring system. The presence of '3aR' and '7aS' suggests that there are chiral centers (or at least stereocenters) at positions 3a and 7a, but the exact structure is hard to visualize. The (E) denotes a double bond configuration. However, even if there are chiral centers (like 3a and 7a), we have to check if the molecule is chiral. Since it has multiple stereocenters, unless it's a meso compound, it would be chiral. But without knowing if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's hard to say. But the name includes R and S configurations, which are assigned to different centers. If they are in different configurations and the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral. Since the question is about optical activity, and the presence of stereocenters with different configurations (R and S) suggests that unless there's a symmetry leading to meso, this would be optically active. But I'm not sure about the exact structure here. Let me think differently: the presence of stereocenters with different configurations (like R and S) and no symmetry would mean the molecule is chiral. Since the compound has two chiral centers (3a and 7a), and the configuration is R and S, unless they are symmetrically placed, which would make it a meso compound. But the positions are 3a and 7a, which might not be symmetric. The (E) isomer of a double bond doesn't contribute to chirality, but the configuration of the stereocenters does. So if the molecule isn't symmetric, then it would be chiral, hence optically active. So I think this compound is optically active.

The name includes a lot of substituents and maybe a bridged ring system. The presence of '3aR' and '7aS' suggests that there are chiral centers (or at least stereocenters) at positions 3a and 7a, but the exact structure is hard to visualize. The (E) denotes a double bond configuration. However, even if there are chiral centers (like 3a and 7a), we have to check if the molecule is chiral. Since it has multiple stereocenters, unless it's a meso compound, it would be chiral. But without knowing if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's hard to say. But the name includes R and S configurations, which are assigned to different centers. If they are in different configurations and the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral. Since the question is about optical activity, and the presence of stereocenters with different configurations (R and S) suggests that unless there's a symmetry leading to meso, this would be optically active. But I'm not sure about the exact structure here. Let me think differently: the presence of stereocenters with different configurations (like R and S) and no symmetry would mean the molecule is chiral. Since the compound has two chiral centers (3a and 7a), and the configuration is R and S, unless they are symmetrically placed, which would make it a meso compound. But the positions are 3a and 7a, which might not be symmetric. The (E) isomer of a double bond doesn't contribute to chirality, but the configuration of the stereocenters does. So if the molecule isn't symmetric, then it would be chiral, hence optically active. So I think this compound is optically active.

The (E) configuration refers to a double bond. The (3aR,7aS) are stereochemical descriptors for the ring positions. Since there are multiple chiral centers (the R and S), but also the E configuration. However, the question is about optical activity. If the molecule has any chiral centers or is asymmetric, then it would be optically active.

So first compound: not optically active.\n\nSecond compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Hmm, this looks complicated. The name includes a lot of substituents and maybe a bridged ring system. The presence of '3aR' and '7aS' suggests that there are chiral centers (or at least stereocenters) at positions 3a and 7a, but the exact structure is hard to visualize. The (E) denotes a double bond configuration. However, even if there are chiral centers (like 3a and 7a), we have to check if the molecule is chiral. Since it has multiple stereocenters, unless it's a meso compound, it would be chiral. But without knowing if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's hard to say. But the name includes R and S configurations, which are assigned to different centers. If they are in different configurations and the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral. Since the question is about optical activity, and the presence of stereocenters with different configurations (R and S) suggests that unless there's a symmetry leading to meso, this would be optically active. But I'm not sure about the exact structure here. Let me think differently: the presence of stereocenters with different configurations (like R and S) and no symmetry would mean the molecule is chiral. Since the compound has two chiral centers (3a and 7a), and the configuration is R and S, unless they are symmetrically placed, which would make it a meso compound. But the positions are 3a and 7a, which might not be symmetric. The (E) isomer of a double bond doesn't contribute to chirality, but the configuration of the stereocenters does. So if the molecule isn't symmetric, then it would be chiral, hence optically active. So I think this compound is optically active. So second compound: yes.\n\nThird compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. The 2,3-dimethyl would add methyl groups to carbons 2 and 3.

The name includes a lot of substituents and maybe a bridged ring system. The presence of '3aR' and '7aS' suggests that there are chiral centers (or at least stereocenters) at positions 3a and 7a, but the exact structure is hard to visualize. The (E) denotes a double bond configuration. However, even if there are chiral centers (like 3a and 7a), we have to check if the molecule is chiral. Since it has multiple stereocenters, unless it's a meso compound, it would be chiral. But without knowing if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's hard to say. But the name includes R and S configurations, which are assigned to different centers. If they are in different configurations and the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral. Since the question is about optical activity, and the presence of stereocenters with different configurations (R and S) suggests that unless there's a symmetry leading to meso, this would be optically active. But I'm not sure about the exact structure here. Let me think differently: the presence of stereocenters with different configurations (like R and S) and no symmetry would mean the molecule is chiral. Since the compound has two chiral centers (3a and 7a), and the configuration is R and S, unless they are symmetrically placed, which would make it a meso compound. But the positions are 3a and 7a, which might not be symmetric. The (E) isomer of a double bond doesn't contribute to chirality, but the configuration of the stereocenters does. So if the molecule isn't symmetric, then it would be chiral, hence optically active. So I think this compound is optically active.
