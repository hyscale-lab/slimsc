So \u03bb_rest1 = \u03bb_rest2 * (1 + v2/c). \n\nBut since both stars have the same observed peak wavelength, that implies that their rest wavelengths are different. Because Star_2's emission peak is at a higher wavelength in its rest frame, but due to its motion, it's redshifted to match Star_1's observed wavelength.",

So \u03bb_obs1 = \u03bb_obs2.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n\u03bb_obs1 = \u03bb_emit1 * sqrt( (1 + v1/c)/(1 - v1/c) )\n\nBut v1 = 0, so \u03bb_obs1 = \u03bb_emit1.\n\n\u03bb_obs2 = \u03bb_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )\n\nSince \u03bb_obs1 = \u03bb_obs2,\n\n\u03bb_emit1 = \u03bb_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )\n\nBut \u03bb_emit is given by Wien's law: \u03bb_emit = b / T.\n\nSo,\n\n\u03bb_emit1 = b / T1\n\n\u03bb_emit2 = b / T2\n\nSo substituting,\n\nb / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )\n\nThe b's cancel:\n\n1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )\n\nRearranging,\n\nT1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )\n\nSince v2 is 700 km/s, which is 7e5 m/s. Let me compute v2/c.\n\nc is approximately 3e8 m/s, so 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) \u2248 0.002333...\n\nSo v2/c \u2248 0.002333.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 - v2/c) \u2248 0.997666...\n\n(1 + v2/c) \u2248 1.002333...\n\nSo the ratio is (0.997666)/(1.002333) \u2248 (0.997666)/(1.002333) \n\nLet me compute that.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can compute (1 - x)/(1 + x) where x is small. For x <<1, (1-x)/(1+x) \u2248 (1 - x)(1 - x) ) \u2248 1 - 2x, using the approximation 1/(1+x) \u2248 1 -x for small x. So here, x is 0.002333.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 - x)/(1 + x) \u2248 (1 - x)(1 - x) ) \u2248 1 - 2x.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt( (1 - x)/(1 + x) ) \u2248 sqrt(1 - 2x) \u2248 1 - x, since sqrt(1 - y) \u2248 1 - y/2 for y small.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt( (1 - x)/(1 + x) ) \u2248 1 - x/ (something), but let me compute it numerically.",

So \u03bb_obs1 = \u03bb_obs2.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n\u03bb_obs1 = \u03bb_emit1 * sqrt( (1 + v1/c)/(1 - v1/c) )\n\nBut v1 = 0, so \u03bb_obs1 = \u03bb_emit1.\n\n\u03bb_obs2 = \u03bb_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )\n\nSince \u03bb_obs1 = \u03bb_obs2,\n\n\u03bb_emit1 = \u03bb_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )\n\nBut \u03bb_emit is given by Wien's law: \u03bb_emit = b / T.\n\nSo,\n\n\u03bb_emit1 = b / T1\n\n\u03bb_emit2 = b / T2\n\nSo substituting,\n\nb / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )\n\nThe b's cancel:\n\n1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )\n\nRearranging,\n\nT1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )\n\nSince v2 is 700 km/s, which is 7e5 m/s. Let me compute v2/c.\n\nc is approximately 3e8 m/s, so 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) \u2248 0.002333...\n\nSo v2/c \u2248 0.002333.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 - v2/c) \u2248 0.997666...\n\n(1 + v2/c) \u2248 1.002333...\n\nSo the ratio is (0.997666)/(1.002333) \u2248 (0.997666)/(1.002333) \n\nLet me compute that.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can compute (1 - x)/(1 + x) where x is small.
