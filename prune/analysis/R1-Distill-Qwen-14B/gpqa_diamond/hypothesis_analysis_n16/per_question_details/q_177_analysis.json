The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is \u03bb_observed = \u03bb_rest * (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity (positive if moving away, negative if approaching). Since Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, its observed \u03bb_max is the same as its rest frame \u03bb_max. For Star_2, moving at 700 km/s, the observed \u03bb_max would be shifted. Let me compute the Doppler shift here.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that Star_1 is at rest, so its observed \u03bb\u2081_max equals its rest frame \u03bb\u2081_rest. Star_2's observed \u03bb\u2082_max is equal to (1 + v/c) times its rest frame \u03bb\u2082_rest.

So for Star_1, \u03bb\u2081_rest = b / T\u2081. For Star_2, \u03bb\u2082_rest = b / T\u2082. \n\nBut the problem says they have the same observed \u03bb_max.",

That's probably the key point here. Because if Star 2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, then the light from it is blueshifted. So the observed \u03bb_max would be shorter than its actual \u03bb_max. Conversely, if Star 1 is at rest (velocity 0), then its observed \u03bb_max is the same as its rest frame.

Let me think.\n\nSuppose that the stars have the same intrinsic temperature, so their \u03bb_max (in their own rest frames) are the same.

So the stated peak wavelengths are in the rest frame? Or maybe the question is implying that even after correcting for the Doppler shift, their rest frame peak wavelengths are the same. Therefore, their temperatures are the same. \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. The problem states: \"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same.\" The \"appeared\" might refer to the observed wavelength. Since Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength would be longer. If they \"found that they are the same\", then the observed wavelengths are the same. Therefore, without correcting for Doppler shift, their intrinsic temperatures would not be the same.",
          "text2": "Wait, maybe the temperatures aren't actually the same? Because even if the peak wavelength is the same, maybe relativistic effects due to the velocity affect the measured wavelength? Because the radial velocity of Star_2 is 700 km/s, so its redshift or blueshift could shift the observed wavelength. But the problem states that the astronomers found the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest to be the same. So the observed lambda_max is the same. But the actual temperature would be different because of the Doppler shift. \n\nOh, right! That's probably it. Because if the star is moving towards us or away, the observed peak wavelength would be blueshifted or redshifted. Since the astronomers measured the same lambda_max for both stars, but Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, which I assume is away from us (since the velocity is given as 700 km/s, maybe the sign is important but not given).",

Since 700 km/s is about 0.00235c (since c is ~3e5 km/s), so the term v/c is small, so the approximation holds.\n\nSo going back, since \u03bb_obs2 = \u03bb_obs1, then:\n\n\u03bb_rest2 = \u03bb_obs2 / (1 + v2/c) = \u03bb_obs1/(1 + v2/c)\n\nThus, the rest frame \u03bb for Star 2 is shorter than \u03bb_obs1, so its temperature T2 is higher than T1.
