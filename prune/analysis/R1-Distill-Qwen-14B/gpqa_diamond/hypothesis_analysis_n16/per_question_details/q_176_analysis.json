          "text1": "Wait, but maybe the problem assumes it's already normalized? Or do I have to normalize it first? The question says \"the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix...\", so I think the given vector is the actual state, but perhaps they didn't mention normalization. Hmm, maybe I need to normalize it. Let me note that down.\n\nSo first step: normalize the state vector. The given vector is [-1; 2; 1]. Its norm squared is 1 +4 +1 =6. Therefore, the normalized state vector is (1/\u221a6)*[-1; 2; 1].\n\nNow, the operators P and Q are given as matrices. Let's write them down.\n\nOperator P:\nFirst row: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\nSecond row: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\nThird row: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nSo the matrix for P is:\n[ 0      1/\u221a2    0      ]\n[1/\u221a2   0       1/\u221a2 ]\n[ 0      1/\u221a2    0      ]\n\nOperator Q's matrix is:\nFirst row: [1, 0, 0]\nSecond row: [0, 0, 0]\nThird row: [0, 0, -1]\n\nSo Q is diagonal with entries 1, 0, -1 on the diagonal.",
          "text2": "Wait a second, maybe I should check the normalization first?\n\nLet me compute the norm of the state vector. The elements are -1, 2, 1. Squaring each component: (-1)^2 = 1, 2^2 =4, 1^2=1. Sum is 1+4+1=6. So the norm squared is 6. Therefore, the normalized state vector is (1/\u221a6)*(-1, 2, 1). So the actual state vector |\u03c8> is that divided by sqrt(6). I need to remember to use the normalized vector for calculations. \n\nThe operators for P and Q are given as matrices. Let me note down their matrices. \n\nFor operator P: \nFirst row: (0, 1/\u221a2, 0)\nSecond row: (1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2)\nThird row: (0, 1/\u221a2, 0)\nSo the matrix for P is:\n[ 0      1/\u221a2     0\n 1/\u221a2   0      1/\u221a2\n 0      1/\u221a2    0 ]\n\nOperator Q's matrix is:\nFirst row: (1, 0, 0)\nSecond row: (0, 0, 0)\nThird row: (0, 0, -1)\nSo Q is:\n[1  0   0\n0  0   0\n0  0  -1]\n\nThe question is, if we first measure P, then measure Q immediately after, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q?",

Therefore, the normalized state is (\u27e8e0 |\u03c8\u27e9 / |\u27e8e0|\u03c8\u27e9| ) |e0\u27e9. \n\nSince \u27e8e0|\u03c8\u27e9 is -\u221a2, then divided by its absolute value \u221a2 gives -1. So the normalized state is -1 * |e0\u27e9, which is the same as |e0\u27e9 up to a global phase. Since global phases don't affect probabilities, the state after measurement is effectively |e0\u27e9. \n\nTherefore, after measuring P and getting 0, the system's state is |e0\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2). \n\nNow, we need to measure Q next.

So the normalized state is (-1/sqrt(3))/(1/sqrt(3)) * |v\u27e9 \u2192 -1 * |v\u27e9, but since global phase doesn't matter, it's equivalent to |v\u27e9.

Let me re-calculate each step. \n\nFirst step: probability of P=0. The state is (-1, 2,1). The eigenstate of P for 0 is (1/\u221a2,0,-1/\u221a2). The inner product is (-1)(1/\u221a2) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1/\u221a2) = (-1/\u221a2 -1/\u221a2) = -2/\u221a2 = -\u221a2. The square of that is (\u221a2)^2 = 2. The norm of the original vector is sqrt( (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(6). So squared norm is 6. Probability is 2/6 = 1/3. That's correct. \n\nThen, after measurement, the system is in the eigenstate |0_P> which is (1/\u221a2,0,-1/\u221a2). \n\nNow, to find the probability of Q=-1. The eigenstate for Q=-1 is (0,0,1). The inner product between |0_P> and that is (1/\u221a2)(0) +0*0 + (-1/\u221a2)(1) = -1/\u221a2. The modulus squared is (1/2). So yes, 1/2. \n\nMultiplying the two: 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Let's see if that works.\n\nIf v = (a,a,a), then P*v:\n\nFirst component: 0*a + (1/\u221a2)*a +0*a = (a/\u221a2).\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*a +0*a + (1/\u221a2)*a = (2a/\u221a2) = \u221a2 a.\n\nThird component: same as first component: a/\u221a2.\n\nSo unless \u221a2 a = \u03bb a, but the components must all be proportional. Let's see, the first and third components are a/\u221a2, the second is \u221a2 a. So unless (a/\u221a2) = \u221a2 a, which would require 1/\u221a2 = \u221a2 \u2192 1/\u221a2 = \u221a2? 1/\u221a2 is approx 0.707, \u221a2 is approx 1.414, so no. So that's not an eigenvector. Hmm.",

Therefore, the normalized state is (\u27e8e0 |\u03c8\u27e9 / |\u27e8e0|\u03c8\u27e9| ) |e0\u27e9. \n\nSince \u27e8e0|\u03c8\u27e9 is -\u221a2, then divided by its absolute value \u221a2 gives -1. So the normalized state is -1 * |e0\u27e9, which is the same as |e0\u27e9 up to a global phase. Since global phases don't affect probabilities, the state after measurement is effectively |e0\u27e9. \n\nTherefore, after measuring P and getting 0, the system's state is |e0\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2). \n\nNow, we need to measure Q next.

So the normalized state is (-1/sqrt(3))/(1/sqrt(3)) * |v\u27e9 \u2192 -1 * |v\u27e9, but since global phase doesn't matter, it's equivalent to |v\u27e9.

Let me re-calculate each step. \n\nFirst step: probability of P=0. The state is (-1, 2,1). The eigenstate of P for 0 is (1/\u221a2,0,-1/\u221a2). The inner product is (-1)(1/\u221a2) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1/\u221a2) = (-1/\u221a2 -1/\u221a2) = -2/\u221a2 = -\u221a2. The square of that is (\u221a2)^2 = 2. The norm of the original vector is sqrt( (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(6). So squared norm is 6. Probability is 2/6 = 1/3. That's correct. \n\nThen, after measurement, the system is in the eigenstate |0_P> which is (1/\u221a2,0,-1/\u221a2). \n\nNow, to find the probability of Q=-1. The eigenstate for Q=-1 is (0,0,1). The inner product between |0_P> and that is (1/\u221a2)(0) +0*0 + (-1/\u221a2)(1) = -1/\u221a2. The modulus squared is (1/2). So yes, 1/2. \n\nMultiplying the two: 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Let's see if that works.\n\nIf v = (a,a,a), then P*v:\n\nFirst component: 0*a + (1/\u221a2)*a +0*a = (a/\u221a2).\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*a +0*a + (1/\u221a2)*a = (2a/\u221a2) = \u221a2 a.\n\nThird component: same as first component: a/\u221a2.\n\nSo unless \u221a2 a = \u03bb a, but the components must all be proportional. Let's see, the first and third components are a/\u221a2, the second is \u221a2 a. So unless (a/\u221a2) = \u221a2 a, which would require 1/\u221a2 = \u221a2 \u2192 1/\u221a2 = \u221a2? 1/\u221a2 is approx 0.707, \u221a2 is approx 1.414, so no. So that's not an eigenvector. Hmm.",

The characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nSo the determinant of:\n\n[ -\u03bb        1/\u221a2        0      ]\n[1/\u221a2      -\u03bb         1/\u221a2   ]\n[ 0        1/\u221a2       -\u03bb     ]\n\nLet me compute this determinant. The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be done by expansion. Let me see:\n\nExpanding along the first row:\n\n-\u03bb * det( [ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2 ]\n          [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ] ) \n\nminus (1/\u221a2) * det( [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2 ]\n                     [0, -\u03bb ] )\n\nplus 0 * ... (third term is zero)\n\nSo first term: -\u03bb [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] \n= -\u03bb [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ]\n\nSecond term: minus (1/\u221a2) times [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ]",

Let me check \u03bb=-1.\n\nMatrix P - (-1)I = P + I:\n\n1, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\n1/\u221a2, 1, 1/\u221a2\n\n0,1/\u221a2,1\n\nDeterminant:\n\n1*(1*1 - (1/\u221a2)^2 ) - (1/\u221a2)*( (1/\u221a2 *1 - 1/\u221a2*0 ) ) +0*...\n\nFirst term: 1*(1 - 1/2) = 1*(1/2)=1/2.\n\nSecond term: -1/\u221a2*(1/\u221a2*(1-0)) \u2192 -1/\u221a2*(1/\u221a2) = -1/2.\n\nThird term zero. So total determinant: 1/2 -1/2 =0. So yes, \u03bb=-1 is also an eigenvalue. So the eigenvalues of P are -1,0,1. That makes sense, since trace is 0, so sum is (-1)+0+1=0.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are -1,0,1. The question is about first measuring P and getting 0. So the system would collapse to the eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0. The probability of that is the square of the absolute value of the projection of the initial state onto that eigenstate.\n\nThe initial state vector is the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Let me denote this as |\u03c8> = [ -1 ; 2 ; 1 ].\n\nFirst, I need to find the normalized eigenvectors of P for eigenvalue 0, then compute the inner product of \u03c8 with that eigenvector, square it, which is the probability of getting 0 when measuring P.\n\nEarlier, we found that eigenvectors for 0 satisfy v2=0, and v3 = -v1. So any vector of the form (a, 0, -a). Let me write this as a vector (a,0,-a). To normalize, the norm squared is a\u00b2 + 0 + a\u00b2 = 2a\u00b2. So norm is |a|\u221a2. Let me set a =1/\u221a2, then the norm would be (1/\u221a2)*\u221a2 =1. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2).",
          "text2": "Alternatively, maybe I can note that the matrix P has a certain pattern. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the structure of P, maybe the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0?

So yes, that works. So with \u03bb=1, the equations are consistent. So an eigenvector would be proportional to (v1, v2, v3) = ( (1/\u221a2)v2, v2, (1/\u221a2)v2 ). Let's pick v2 = \u221a2 for simplicity. Then v1 =1, v2=\u221a2, v3=1. So vector (1, \u221a2,1). But we need to normalize it. The norm squared is 1\u00b2 + (\u221a2)^2 +1\u00b2 =1 +2 +1=4. So norm is 2. So normalized eigenvector is (1/2, \u221a2/2, 1/2).",
