          "text1": "Wait, this is a problem. Maybe I need to think of the EDTA concentration. If the solution is stoichiometric, then the initial concentrations of Ca and EDTA were equal, so that when they form the complex, they are in 1:1 ratio. So total Ca is 0.02 M, and total EDTA is also 0.02 M.",
          "text2": "Wait, but wait. The total concentration of the EDTA and the complex would depend on initial concentrations, but maybe here the problem is simplified. Since the solution is stoichiometric, perhaps the initial moles of Ca and EDTA are equal, so that all EDTA is complexed except for a small amount. But if the complex is 0.02 M, then the free Ca and EDTA concentrations would be equal and small.",
