The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (v + 1/2) * \u0127\u03c9, where v is the vibrational quantum number. For rotation, the energy is E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant and J is the rotational quantum number.\n\nSo the total energy is E = E_vib + E_rot. So in the fundamental state, v=0 and J=0. The next lowest state could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. We need to find which of these requires less energy.\n\nLet's compute the energy for each transition. The current state is (v=0, J=0). The next state could be (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). So the energy difference for the vibrational transition is from v=0 to v=1.

The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the next state in the hierarchy. But I'm a bit confused because the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational. So the next state could be either a higher vibration (v=1) or a higher rotation (J=1). Which has lower energy?\n\nThe energy of the total state is E = E_vib + E_rot. For the fundamental state, E = (0 + 1/2) h w + B (0 + 1) * 0 = 0.5 h w.\n\nIf the molecule transitions to J=1, v=0: E = 0.5 h w + 2B.\n\nIf it transitions to v=1, J=0: E = (1 + 1/2) h w + B * 0 = 1.5 h w.\n\nWhich of these two is lower? 0.5 h w + 2B vs 1.5 h w.\n\nAs h w is about 2.65e-19 J and 2B is 9.1e-22 J, 0.5 h w is 1.325e-19 J, plus 9.1e-22 J is about 1.334e-19 J. The other option is 1.5 h w = 3.975e-19 J. So 1.334e-19 J is less than 3.975e-19 J. Therefore, the lower energy transition is the rotational one. So the photon must provide energy for the rotational transition.\n\nAh, so the energy of the photon must be equal to the rotational energy difference.",

We need to find which of these transitions requires less energy, meaning the photon's energy should match the lower of the two.\n\nSo let's compute both energy differences.\n\nFirst, compute the rotational energy difference. For J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is E_rot = (\u0127\u00b2/(2I)) * 2 * 1*(1+1) \u2192 wait no, the energy for J=0 is 0, and for J=1 is (\u0127\u00b2/(2I)) * 2 (since J(J+1) is 2 when J=1).

The photon's energy must match this energy difference, because in quantum transitions, the photon's energy must match the energy gap (assuming it's a single photon absorption and no other processes).\n\nSo first, calculate the energy difference for the vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1. The energy for v=0 is (0 + 1/2)\u0127\u03c9, and for v=1, it's (1 + 1/2)\u0127\u03c9.

For J=1, E_r = [1*2 * \u0127\u00b2]/(2I) = (2 \u0127\u00b2)/(2I) = \u0127\u00b2/(I). \n\nSo I need to find I, the moment of inertia.
