          "text1": "Alternatively, maybe it's treated as a dipole. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me recall the multipole expansion.\n\nIn the radiation zone, the electric field is given by the multipole expansion terms. The dominant term for an oscillating charge distribution would depend on its moment. For a dipole, the radiation is proportional to (sin\u03b8)^2, and for a quadrupole, maybe (3cos\u00b2\u03b8 -1) or something else.",
          "text2": "Wait, the key point here might be the direction of oscillation. If the charge distribution is spheroidal and oscillates along the symmetry axis (z-axis), then the radiation would be similar to a dipole along the z-axis. The dipole's radiation pattern is strongest perpendicular to the dipole, i.e., along the equator (theta = 90 degrees). The angular dependence for dipole radiation is proportional to sin^2(theta).",

          "text2": "Wait, let me think. The power radiated in a direction theta is proportional to (sin(theta))^2 for a dipole. So the maximum is at theta = 90 degrees (sin^2 is 1 there), and zero along the axis (theta 0 or 180).",

          "text1": "Wait, but what about the dependence on \u03bb?\n\nThe radiated power per unit solid angle for dipole radiation is proportional to (1/\u03bb^4), since the power from a dipole is proportional to (a\u00b2 \u03c9^4)/(c^3), and since \u03c9 is related to the frequency f = c/\u03bb, so substituting \u03c9 = 2\u03c0c/\u03bb, so \u03c9^4 ~ (1/\u03bb^4). So the dependence on \u03bb would be \u03bb^-4, so the function f is proportional to \u03bb^-4. So the options, if the angular dependence is sin\u00b2\u03b8 and the \u03bb dependence is \u03bb^-4, then the fraction at \u03b8=30 is 1/4, so that would correspond to option C (1/4, \u03bb^-4).",

Now, the other part is the dependence on lambda. The question says the function f depends on lambda and theta. The radiated power per unit solid angle in the radiation zone for dipole radiation depends on 1/lambda^4, right? Since the intensity (power per unit area) for dipole radiation is proportional to (1/lambda^4) * (sin^2(theta)), I think.",
