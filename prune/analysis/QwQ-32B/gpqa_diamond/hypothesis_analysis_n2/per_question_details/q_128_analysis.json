          "text2": "Wait, but actually, the mRNA is synthesized from the DNA template strand, which is complementary. So the mRNA sequence is complementary to the DNA's template strand. Therefore, the coding strand of the DNA has the same sequence as the mRNA except T instead of U. So when translating DNA to protein, you need to consider the mRNA as being complementary to the template DNA strand. \n\nHmm, perhaps an easier way is to take the DNA sequence, reverse it (since the mRNA is made from the complementary strand), then take the reverse complement, then transcribe to mRNA (so replacing T with U), then translate. But this might be a bit complicated.",
