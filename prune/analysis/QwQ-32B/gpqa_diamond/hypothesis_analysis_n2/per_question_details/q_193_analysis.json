But when converting to distance, since plx is inversely proportional to d, the number as a function of d would be N(d) \u221d d^5. But when considering the number per unit distance, perhaps there's an additional factor from the volume element?",

To find the number per unit distance, we need to consider the Jacobian of the transformation from plx to r. Since plx = 1/r, the derivative of plx with respect to r is d(plx)/dr = -1/r\u00b2.
