So the first part of the option is where they met (the location of the meeting), and the second is where the chain is going. \n\nHmm. Let me think again. The RNP (SRP) meets the nascent chain at the ribosome. The SRP then directs the ribosome to the ER. So the meeting is at the ribosome. The chain is then going into the ER. But the options don't have ribosome to ER. Looking at the options again:\n\nA) cytosol to extracellular. That doesn't fit. The meeting is at the ribosome (which is in the cytosol?), but the direction is from cytosol to outside. \n\nB) ribosome to proteasome. But why would the chain go to proteasome? The dialogue seems positive, like moving forward. \n\nC) membrane to nucleus. Not sure. \n\nD) Golgi to mitochondrion. No, that doesn't fit the early steps.",

The meeting place is the ribosome, so the path is ribosome \u2192 ER \u2192 Golgi \u2192 extracellular. But the question is asking where they met (the ribosome) and where the chain is heading (extracellular). So the answer would be A. \n\nYes, because the chain is a secreted protein, so it's going from the cytosol (where the ribosome is) to the extracellular space. But the meeting is at the ribosome, so the movement is from the ribosome's location (cytosol) to the extracellular. The options have A as cytosol to extracellular. So the answer is A.",
