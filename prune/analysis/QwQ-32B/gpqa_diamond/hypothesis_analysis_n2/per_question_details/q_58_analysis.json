So you still need to regularize the theory, even if the high energy part is easier to handle. So B probably requires regularization.\n\nOption C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the quantum field theory of electromagnetism. I know that QED requires renormalization. For example, the electron self-energy diverges, so you have to regularize those integrals.

Since regularization is a quantum field theory concept, classical theories don't have those infinities. Because in classical electrodynamics, you don't have virtual particles or loop diagrams.

Since regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories, classical theories like D don't need it because they don't have the same divergences. But maybe the question is looking for a quantum theory that doesn't need regularization. The options include both. Let me check the options again. The options are A to D. The question says \"physical theories\", so D is a valid option. So the answer could be D, because classical electrodynamics doesn't involve quantum loops, so no regularization needed. But the question is about high energies. In classical electrodynamics at high energies, like in extreme cases, but still, the theory doesn't have quantum corrections, so no divergences.",
          "text2": "Wait, so the question is asking which theory \"never requires regularization at high energies\". The key here is that classical theories don't have the quantum aspects that lead to divergences. So even at high energies, in classical electrodynamics, you don't have the same kind of infinities that require regularization. So D would be correct.",

          "text1": "Wait, the question is which theory \"never requires regularization at high energies\". So, for example, QED and QCD do need regularization even at high energies because their divergences don't vanish. But in string theory, since it's a finite theory, maybe even at high energies, you don't need regularization. But maybe even in string theory, some regularization is needed? Or perhaps it's inherently finite so no. But the question says \"never requires regularization at high energies\". So if the theory is finite, then regularization isn't needed at any energy. So A would also be correct. But the options can't have two answers. So perhaps the question is looking for the classical theory as the answer, since that's not a quantum theory at all, so it doesn't have those divergences. So D is the answer.",
          "text2": "Wait, let me think again. The question is which theory \"never requires regularization at high energies.\" Superstring Theory (A) might be a candidate because it's supposed to be a finite theory. I've heard that string theory calculations don't have the same ultraviolet divergences as point particle QFTs. So in string theory, when you compute scattering amplitudes, the loops don't produce the same kind of infinities because the strings have an extended structure. So maybe A is the correct answer here. But then D is classical, so it doesn't even use quantum field theory, so it doesn't have regularization. The question is which theory \"never requires\" regularization. So if the question is about quantum theories, then D is classical, so not a quantum theory. But the options include both quantum and classical. The question doesn't specify.",
