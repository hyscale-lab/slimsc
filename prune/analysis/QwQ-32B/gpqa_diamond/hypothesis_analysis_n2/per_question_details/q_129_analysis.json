Let's try to draw this out mentally.\n\nAssume that compound A is a ketone. Let's say the ketone is in a cyclopentane ring. The Wittig reaction would form a double bond between the carbonyl carbon and the ylide's carbon. The product given is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The numbering is important here. Let's see: the cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. The 4 position has a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a double bond. Since the ylide's group is forming the double bond at position 4, that suggests that the original carbonyl group in A was on the 4th carbon of the cyclopentane ring. Because in the Wittig reaction, the ylide adds to the carbonyl group, so the carbonyl would be on the 4th carbon of the cyclopentane. Therefore, compound A is 4-oxocyclopentane (a ketone on carbon 4). But then the substituents at positions 1 and 2 are methyl groups.",

For example, the double bond would link the cyclopentane's C4 to another carbon (the ylide's part). The ylide's R groups would be the substituents on that double bond. So if the product has a propan-2-ylidene group attached at position 4, that suggests that the ylide's R groups were a methyl and an ethyl (since propan-2-yl is isopropyl, so substituents would be two methyl groups on the central carbon?), but maybe the ylide was made from something like isopropyltriphenylphosphonium bromide, so when it reacts with the ketone, the double bond would have the isopropyl group attached. Hmm, maybe it's getting too detailed, but the key point is that the structure of the product (the Wittig product) gives information about the structure of A.\n\nSo if the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane, then the starting ketone (A) must have a carbonyl group at position 4 of the cyclopentane ring.
