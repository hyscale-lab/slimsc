          "text1": "Another possibility: PFA crosslinks proteins to DNA, but DSG crosslinks proteins to proteins. So, when you use PFA+DSG, the antibodies might not be able to access their epitopes if they are crosslinked to other proteins. So, regions where the IKAROS is part of a large complex (like at active promoters) might have their epitopes masked when crosslinked with DSG, leading to loss of signal. But that would mean the peaks that disappear are the active regions, which would make D the answer. But that contradicts the previous thought. \n\nHmm, this is conflicting.",
          "text2": "Wait, but the question says that the peaks that were there with PFA are gone when using PFA+DSG. So the disappearing peaks are precisely the ones that were present under PFA but not under PFA+DSG. \n\nTherefore, the regions where IKAROS is in a complex that becomes too tightly crosslinked with DSG would lose their signal. Those regions would be where IKAROS is part of a stable complex. Active promoters and enhancers are exactly such regions where transcription factors are part of active complexes. So in those regions, DSG's crosslinking causes the antibody to not detect them anymore. So the disappearing peaks would be at active promoters and enhancers (option D).",
