          "text2": "Wait, hold on. The sphere is grounded, so the induced charges on the sphere are maintained at zero potential. The potential energy of the system would be the work done to bring the charge q to its position, considering the induced charges. But using the method of images, the potential outside the sphere is the same as that of the two charges (q and q'), so the potential energy of the system is the potential energy between the two point charges. But since the sphere's charges are induced and grounded, their contribution is accounted for by the image charge.",
