But in the g1 mutant (so G2 is present, but G1 is missing), there is still some resistance (75%). That implies that when G2 is present, G3 can still contribute. \n\nSo in the g1 mutant, G2 is working, so G3 is still expressed. So the resistance is 75% (since G1 was missing, but G3 is active). Similarly, in g3, G2 is present but G3 is missing, so G1 is active, leading to 50% resistance. \n\nTherefore, G2's presence allows G1 and G3 to be expressed, but each contributes to resistance. The wild-type has both, so full resistance. \n\nSo G2 must be a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. \n\nNow, looking at the double mutants: \n\ng1g2: missing G1 and G2. Since G2 is missing, G1 and G3 can't be expressed, so resistance is 0. \n\ng2g3: same as g2, because without G2, even if G3 is missing, the problem is G2. \n\ng1g3: missing both G1 and G3.
