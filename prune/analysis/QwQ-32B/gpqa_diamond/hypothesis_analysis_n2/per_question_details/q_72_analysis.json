          "text1": "Wait, bicyclo[2.2.1] heptane has three rings: the main ring is seven-membered, but the numbering might be different. Let me sketch it mentally: bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has two adjacent bridges of two carbons each, and one bridge of one carbon. The double bonds are at positions 2 and 5. So the structure has a norbornene-like system with two double bonds. \n\nThe reagent is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So that's a cyclohexadiene with two double bonds (at 1 and 3?), and at positions 5 and 6, there are two CH2Br2 groups (since each is a dibromomethyl group). So each of those positions has a CH2Br2. \n\nSo when combining the starting material with two equivalents of this, maybe each dibromomethyl group undergoes some reaction. Since there are two equivalents, perhaps each of the two bromomethyl groups from each reagent participate? Or maybe each reagent contributes two, so two equivalents would be four bromomethyl groups? Not sure yet.",
          "text2": "Wait, the bis(dibromomethyl) would mean each has two bromines on the methyl groups? Or maybe each is a bromine on the carbon that's attached to the cyclohexadiene? Hmm, maybe I should think of the structure. \n\nThe starting compound is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. That ring structure has a bridgehead at position 7 with a tert-butoxy group. The other reactant is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Let me visualize that. The cyclohexa-1,3-diene has double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4 positions maybe?",
