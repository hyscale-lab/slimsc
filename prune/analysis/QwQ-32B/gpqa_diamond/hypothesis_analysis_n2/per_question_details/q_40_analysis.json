          "text1": "Alternatively, in NMR spectra, if two compounds have overlapping peaks, but the question is more about separation. \n\nHmm. Let's look at the options again. The options are about their properties. The key is which property would lead them to not separate. \n\nIf they have similar polarities (A), then in a polar solvent system, they would have similar interactions with the stationary phase in chromatography, so they wouldn't separate. So that would make them \"on top\" (same spot on TLC). \n\nIf they have similar boiling points (C), then in fractional distillation, they would vaporize at the same time, making separation difficult. So the distillate would have both, so they are \"on top\" in the sense they can't be separated. \n\nSo which is more likely? The question mentions synthetic organic chemistry lab. In such labs, when synthesizing a compound, they might be trying to purify it via recrystallization, chromatography, etc. \n\nThe phrase \"on top of each other\" sounds like during a separation technique like chromatography. So if they are on top, same spot, so A.",
