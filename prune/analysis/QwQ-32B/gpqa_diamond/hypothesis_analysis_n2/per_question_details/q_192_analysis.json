The electric field outside a spherical shell of charge is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So regardless of where the charge inside the cavity is, as long as the conductor is a spherical shell, the external field would be as if the charge were at the center.",

So when the charge +q is placed in the cavity, the induced charge on the inner surface would be -q, but distributed in a way that depends on the position of the charge. But the conductor's outer surface would have +q. However, since the conductor is a spherical shell, but with an offset cavity, does that affect the field outside?\n\nHmm, I remember that for a conducting shell with a cavity, even if the cavity is not centered, the induced charges on the outer surface will still produce a field as if the total charge is at the center of the shell.",

          "text1": "Wait, the conductor is a solid sphere with a cavity. The presence of the charge +q inside the cavity would induce a -q on the inner surface of the conductor (the one facing the cavity). The outer surface must then have +q to keep the conductor neutral. The outer surface's charge distribution would be such that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. \n\nBut when calculating the field outside, maybe the outer charge distribution can be considered as an equivalent point charge at the center? Because the conductor is a sphere, even if the cavity is displaced, the induced outer charge would arrange itself in a way that from outside, it looks like a point charge at the center. Is that right?",
          "text2": "Wait, the standard result is that if you have a conducting shell (even if it's a sphere) with a cavity, and there's a charge inside the cavity, then the outer surface charge redistributes such that the field outside the shell is the same as if the total enclosed charge (the charge in the cavity plus any net charge on the shell) were concentrated at the center. But here the shell (the conductor) is neutral, so the outer charge is +q. But the position of the cavity's charge might not affect the external field because the induced charges on the conductor arrange such that the external field is as if the +q is at the center of the conductor?",
