Let me think.\n\nThe electron's total energy is 4mc\u00b2, and its rest mass is mc\u00b2, so the kinetic energy is 3mc\u00b2. The momentum can be calculated via E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (mc\u00b2)^2. Let me compute the momentum for the electron first.\n\nFor the electron: E_e = 4mc\u00b2. Then, (E_e)^2 = (p_e c)^2 + (mc\u00b2)^2. So, (p_e c)^2 = (4mc\u00b2)^2 - (mc\u00b2)^2 = 16 m\u00b2 c^4 - m\u00b2c^4 = 15 m\u00b2c^4. Therefore, p_e c = sqrt(15) m c\u00b2.
