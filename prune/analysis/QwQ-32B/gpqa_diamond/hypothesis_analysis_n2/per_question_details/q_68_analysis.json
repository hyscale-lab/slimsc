          "text1": "Wait, no, actually S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2, so H would have eigenvalues -\u03b3 B (S_y), so the eigenvalues would be \u00b1 \u03b3 B \u0127/2. The energy difference between the two states would be \u03b3 B \u0127. The frequency related to that energy difference would be via \u03c9 = \u0394E/\u0127 = \u03b3 B. \n\nBut the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the moment. So when the field is turned to Y, the system is in an eigenstate of S_z (the initial state was +S_z), which is not an eigenstate of H (since H is proportional to S_y now). The time evolution will cause the expectation value of S_z to oscillate. The frequency of this oscillation should be equal to the Larmor frequency, which is \u03b3 B.",
          "text2": "Wait, the initial state is the eigenstate of Sz with +1/2 (since the magnetic moment was aligned with the original B field in Z). But when the Hamiltonian suddenly changes to being S_y, the system is no longer in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, so it will start evolving according to the new Hamiltonian. The question is about the expectation value of Sz over time, which should oscillate because the state is a superposition of the eigenstates of Sy now?\n\nLet me think step by step. Let's denote the initial state as |+z\u27e9, the eigenstate of Sz with eigenvalue \u0127/2 (but maybe we can just work in units where \u0127 is 1 for simplicity, since the frequency might not depend on \u0127).

The eigenstates of Sy are |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, which are different from |\u00b1z\u27e9. \n\nSo the initial state |+z\u27e9 can be expressed in terms of the eigenstates of Sy. I remember that the eigenstates of Sy can be written in the Sz basis. The eigenstates of Sy are (|+z\u27e9 \u00b1 i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2.

          "text1": "But wait, maybe I need to compute it more precisely.\n\nLet me approach step by step.\n\nThe initial state is |+z\u27e9, the eigenstate of S_z with +\u0127/2. The initial Hamiltonian is H_initial = -\u03bc\u00b7B_initial. Since B_initial is along z, and \u03bc is \u03b3 S (assuming standard, even if the problem says \u03bc = \u03b3 Sz, maybe that's a mistake), so H_initial would be -\u03b3 S_z B. But when the field is turned off and then turned on along Y, the new Hamiltonian is H' = -\u03bc\u00b7B' = -\u03b3 S_y B, since B is along Y now. \n\nThe time evolution is governed by H'. The state will evolve according to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The expectation value of S_z will depend on the time evolution of the state.\n\nTo compute \u27e8S_z\u27e9(t), we need to express the initial state in terms of the eigenstates of H'. The eigenstates of S_y are the eigenstates of S_y, which can be written in terms of the S_z basis vectors. Let me recall that S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2.
