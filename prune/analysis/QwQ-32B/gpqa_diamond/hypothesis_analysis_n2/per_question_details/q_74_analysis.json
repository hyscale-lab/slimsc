Let's see, maybe approximate it. Let me see, e^-0.385 is about e^-0.4 is 0.67, so that would be right. So \u03bb \u2248 0.38566 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute. \n\nNow, the question is, given that the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? So the total time from now would be 150 minutes, but since it's already been 50 minutes without decaying, the total time since the start would be 200 minutes?",
