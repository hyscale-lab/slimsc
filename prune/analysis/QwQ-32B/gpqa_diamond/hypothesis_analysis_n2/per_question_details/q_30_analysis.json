So the absorbed energy would be the energy that caused the excitation. Since emission is lower energy than absorption. Therefore, the absorbed light's energy is higher than the emitted. But how do I find the color of the absorbed light?",
          "text2": "Wait, maybe the question is a bit different. Let me check the question again.\n\nThe question says: \"What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?\" The dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So emission is the release of energy when it goes from excited to ground state. The absorbed light would have provided the energy to reach that excited state. So the absorbed photon's energy must be equal to the energy difference between the ground and excited state. The emitted photon's energy is the energy difference between the excited and ground state (minus any losses).",

          "text1": "Alternatively, maybe the question is actually asking for the emitted color, but it's phrased as absorbed? Let me check the question again.\n\nThe question says, \"What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?\" given that the emitted light has energy 2.3393 eV. So, the absorbed light would have higher energy than the emitted. Because when the molecule absorbs a photon, it goes to a higher energy state, then emits with less energy. So the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted. Therefore, the absorbed photon has a shorter wavelength (since energy E = hc/lambda, so higher E means shorter lambda). \n\nSo first, I need to find the wavelength of the emitted light, then find the color corresponding to that, but since the absorbed is higher energy (shorter wavelength), so the color would be a higher energy color.",
