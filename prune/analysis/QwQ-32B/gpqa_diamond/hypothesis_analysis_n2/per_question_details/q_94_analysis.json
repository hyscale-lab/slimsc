The vinyl group is attached to C1, so the vinyl is a CH2=CH- group attached to C1. So the structure would have double bonds at C1-C2 (the cyclohexene bond) and between the vinyl's two carbons (C1-vinyl C). So the overall structure would have two double bonds adjacent to each other at C1. That would form a conjugated diene?
