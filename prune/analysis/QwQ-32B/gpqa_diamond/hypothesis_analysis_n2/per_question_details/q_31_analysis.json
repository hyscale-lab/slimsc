Since the methyl is there first, the nitro will go ortho or para to the methyl. Now, between ortho and para, which is more stable? The para position would be less hindered, perhaps leading to higher stability.",

The methyl directs the nitro to ortho or para. So the nitro group can be in either o or p. However, the most stable position would be the para position because that gives the best resonance.",
