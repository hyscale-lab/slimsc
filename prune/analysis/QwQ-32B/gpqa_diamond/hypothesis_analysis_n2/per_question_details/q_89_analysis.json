Let me visualize. Adamantane has a central carbon connected to three methylene groups. The positions 1 and 3 might be on adjacent carbons. If each bromine is on a different carbon, then eliminating both would form a double bond between them? Because in an E2 reaction, the base would abstract a hydrogen adjacent to the bromine, leading to the formation of a double bond. Since there are two bromines, maybe they both undergo elimination, leading to a diene?",

Since KOH is a strong base, each Br would lose a proton from the adjacent carbon, forming a double bond. However, since the carbons with the bromines are adjacent in the adamantane structure, the two eliminations would form a double bond between the two carbons. Because adamantane has a rigid structure, maybe the two eliminations lead to a conjugated double bond?",

If two protons (like a CH2), it's a triplet. If it's adjacent to two separate CH2 groups (each with two H's), then the total coupling would be from both groups. \n\nSuppose the H is adjacent to a CH2 (two H's) and also to another CH2 (two H's).
