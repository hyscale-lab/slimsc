          "text2": "Wait, when mCPBA is used with an alkene, it does indeed form an epoxide. The reaction is the oxidation of the alkene to form an epoxide. The mechanism involves the mCPBA acting as an oxidizing agent, adding oxygen across the double bond. Since mCPBA is a peroxy acid, the reaction proceeds via an epoxidation pathway. \n\nSo for each reaction, Reaction 1 starts with (E)-oct-4-ene, and Reaction 2 with (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with mCPBA, which would form an epoxide. But the stereochemistry of the starting alkene would influence the stereochemistry of the epoxide formed.",
