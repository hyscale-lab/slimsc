The product B is pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine. \n\nOption C has the same reagents but the product is heptan-4-one. \n\nHmm. Let me think of the steps. If the starting compound is the enamine (imine?), then adding LDA (a strong base) in DME (solvent) would deprotonate a \u03b2-hydrogen, making a carbanion. This carbanion could then attack an alkylating agent like ethyl iodide (CH3CH2I). The alkyl group would add to the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen, forming a new carbon-carbon bond. Then, when you protonate with acid (H3O+), the enamine would be converted back to the original ketone and the amine.",

Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, in the first step with LDA: if the enamine is deprotonated, perhaps at an alpha position (since enamines can undergo \u03b1-deprotonation), forming a carbanion. The LDA would deprotonate the enamine to form an enolate-like species. \n\nThen, the alkyl halide (ethyl iodide) would alkylate the carbanion, adding an ethyl group.
