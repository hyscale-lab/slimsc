          "text1": "Wait, but the energy difference between the two levels is the energy of the photon emitted in the transition. So that's correct. \n\nNow, the ratio of the populations (n2/n1) is proportional to exp( -\u0394E/(k T) ), assuming the lower level is level 1 and the upper is level 2?",
          "text2": "Wait, actually, the formula is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(kT) ). Since the transition is between those two levels, the energy difference is E2 - E1 = h c / \u03bb. \n\nAssuming that the statistical weights (g2/g1) are the same in both cases (since the spots don't change the atomic structure, just the temperature), then the ratio between R1 and R2 would only depend on the exponential terms. \n\nSo R1/R2 = exp( (\u0394E)/(k) (1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots) )",
