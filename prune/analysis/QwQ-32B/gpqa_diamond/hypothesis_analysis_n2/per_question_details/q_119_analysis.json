          "text1": "Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is on a tertiary carbon, making it a good candidate for elimination. So the first step is E2 elimination, giving an alkene and HBr. So the product A would be an alkene. But the question is, which alkene? The position of the double bond would depend on the structure.",
          "text2": "Alternatively, if the bromine is on a tertiary carbon, maybe it's an elimination, but in the first step with water, maybe it's a hydrolysis to an alcohol. So the bromine would be replaced by an -OH group. So the first step would give an alcohol at position 5. Then, when treated with PDC, which oxidizes primary or secondary alcohols to aldehydes/ketones.",
