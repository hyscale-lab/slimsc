          "text1": "Wait, the question is about probabilities. Since probabilities are calculated as the square of the coefficients in the normalized state, maybe I need to first normalize the given vector. Let me do that. The norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state would be each component divided by sqrt(6). So the normalized |\u03c8\u27e9 would be [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T. Hmm, that's important because probabilities depend on that.\n\nNow, the problem says, if we first measure P and then Q, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and then -1 for Q. To find this, we need to consider the process: first, measuring P, which will project the system into an eigenstate of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, then measuring Q. The probability is the probability of getting 0 in the first measurement multiplied by the probability of getting -1 in the second measurement given that first result.\n\nSo first step: find the possible eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P. The matrix for P is given. Let me write that out.\n\nThe operator P is a 3x3 matrix. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So the matrix P is symmetric, so it's hermitian, so it's an observable. The eigenvalues of P must be real.\n\nWe need to find the eigenvalues of P, specifically the eigenvalue 0.",
