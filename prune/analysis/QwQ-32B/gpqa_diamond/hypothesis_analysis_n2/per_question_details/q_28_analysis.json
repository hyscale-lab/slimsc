Since the cyclohexene is part of a ring, inserting a phenyl group might lead to ring expansion or a new substituent.",

So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with a ketone at C1 and a hydroxyl on C4. When we treat with Ph2CuLi, which is a reagent that can add to the double bond. The addition would be a phenyl group adding to the double bond. But how? The Ph2CuLi is a phenyl cuprate, which can attack the double bond in an electrophilic addition, inserting a phenyl group. Since it's being added to the double bond between C2 and C3, the addition would lead to a new carbon (the phenyl) attached to that double bond.",
