Let's see, since it's the coding sequence, the gene's start is ATG (the first few bases are ATG...). Let me look at the start. The first part is 5' ATG... so that's the start codon. Now, I need to check the rest of the sequence for a premature stop. Let me parse the sequence in triplets.

          "text2": "Wait, let me think again. The mRNA is synthesized from the template (minus) strand, so the DNA's plus strand is the same as the mRNA except T\u2192U. So the mRNA sequence is the same as the plus strand's DNA but with U's. Therefore, to find a stop codon in the mRNA, the DNA plus strand would have a triplet of TAA, TAG, or TGA (since mRNA's UAA would correspond to DNA TAA on the plus strand). \n\nSo if in the DNA sequence provided, there is a TAA, TAG, or TGA before the end, that would be a premature stop codon. Let me scan through the given DNA sequence for any such triplet.\n\nLooking at the given DNA sequence (the plus strand):\n\nThe sequence starts with 5'ATGTAC... and goes on. Let me parse it in triplets (since the reading frame starts at the ATG start codon, which is the first triplet here. The first triplet is ATG (which is the start codon). Then TAC, CAA, etc.",
