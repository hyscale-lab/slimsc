          "text2": "Alternatively, considering the presence of a pyrrolidine ring, maybe the reaction is an enamine formation. Enamines are formed when a secondary amine reacts with an aldehyde or ketone under acid catalysis. The mechanism involves the amine acting as a base to abstract a proton, then the carbonyl oxygen becomes deprotonated, leading to the formation of an iminium ion. Then, the electrons from the amine nitrogen form a double bond with the carbonyl carbon, resulting in an enamine. But in this case, the product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group.",
