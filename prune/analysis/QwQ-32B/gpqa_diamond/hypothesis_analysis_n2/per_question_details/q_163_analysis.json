Three OH groups: 3*17=51. So total is 55.845 +51 = 106.845 g/mol. That's correct. So 0.1g divided by 106.845 gives 0.1 / 106.845 \u2248 0.000936 mol.

The closest option is C (28.05 cm3) but maybe there's a rounding difference? Or maybe I need to consider significant figures? Let's see. The given 0.1 g might have only one significant figure, but the options are given with more decimals. Hmm, perhaps the problem expects exact calculation. Let me see.",

          "text1": "Wait, so perhaps when you add the acid, you have to consider that after neutralizing all the Fe(OH)3, there's an excess of H+ which will determine the pH. Let me think again.\n\nThe reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ \u2192 Fe^3+ + 3H2O. So the H+ must be in excess to dissolve the solid Fe(OH)3. The minimum volume would be when the acid exactly provides 3 moles H+ per mole Fe(OH)3, but in reality, to dissolve the solid, you might need a slight excess.",
          "text2": "Wait, but the problem says \"minimum volume of acid needed to prepare the solution\"\u2014so that would be the amount needed to just neutralize all the Fe(OH)3. Then, once neutralized, the solution would have Fe^3+ in solution. But Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, so its dissolution requires the acid. But once dissolved, the Fe^3+ can hydrolyze to produce H+ ions, which would lower the pH further. \n\nSo, maybe after dissolving all Fe(OH)3, the solution's pH is not just from excess H+ but also from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.",
