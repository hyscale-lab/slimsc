          "text1": "Wait, but in the problem, when direction is along x-z plane, the angle theta is measured from the z-axis. So perhaps in the given problem, the direction is parametrized by theta (the angle from z-axis) and phi is fixed (either 0 or pi). But the problem states \"arbitrary direction\", so the answer must include phi as a parameter. Therefore, the answer would have to include the e^{i phi} term. Since the question is about an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, phi is part of the parameter, so the eigenvector must be written with e^{i phi}, so option B. However, in my earlier derivation, I didn't have the e^{i phi} term. Where did that come from?\n\nHmm, maybe my mistake was in parametrizing the direction as (sin theta, 0, cos theta), which corresponds to phi=0. But in reality, if the direction is in the x-z plane, phi can be 0 or \u03c0 (for positive or negative x direction). However, the general case for any direction in x-z plane can still be parametrized with theta (angle from z-axis) and phi=0 or pi.",
          "text2": "Wait, let me think again. The direction is in x-z plane, so phi (azimuthal angle) is 0 or \u03c0, so e^{i phi} would be 1 or -1. So maybe option B is possible if theta is a different angle, but in our case, the eigenvector components are real, so maybe when phi is 0, it would be cos(theta), sin(theta). But the problem's eigenvector is in terms of theta/2. Hmm.",
