          "text1": "Alternatively, perhaps it's a methyl group attached to a secondary carbon, like in a isobutyl group? Let me think. \n\nThe 2.9 ppm multiplet (m, 1H) might be a methylene group adjacent to a branch, maybe part of a sec-butyl group. Let's see: in a sec-butyl group, which is (CH2CH(CH3)CH2-), the middle CH would have a signal around 1.6-2.0 ppm maybe? Hmm, not sure. The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) could be another methylene group, perhaps part of a longer chain. The 0.9 ppm triplet is definitely the terminal methyl (-CH2CH2CH3). \n\nPutting this together, the structure of compound X likely has a carboxylic acid group (from the IR and 10.5 ppm), an aromatic ring (from the aromatic peaks), and an alkyl chain attached to the ring. \n\nLooking at the NMR data, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. Since those are two doublets (d) each with 2H, that suggests that the substituents on the benzene ring are on the para positions. Let me think: in a para-disubstituted benzene, the two substituents are opposite each other. Let's say we have a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (COOH) on one side and an alkyl group on the opposite side. The protons adjacent to the carboxylic acid would be at higher ppm (more deshielded) than those next to the alkyl group. The 8.0 ppm might be the protons meta to the COOH and para to the alkyl group, while the 7.2 ppm might be the ones next to the alkyl group? Not sure exactly, but the key is that the groups are para.\n\nThe alkyl chain: let's count the number of carbons. The NMR has a methyl at 0.9 (3H), then another methylene at 1.7 (2H), then a methylene at 2.9 (1H?), wait that doesn't add up. Let me parse the NMR peaks again. The 0.9 is a triplet (t, 3H) - that's a terminal CH2CH2CH3? Or maybe an ethyl group?",

The 2.9 ppm m (multiplet) for 1H. Then 1.7 ppm m (multiplet) for 2H, 1.4 ppm d (doublet) for 3H, and 0.9 ppm t (triplet) for 3H. \n\nSo putting together the NMR data. The structure probably has a benzene ring with some substituents. The 10.5 ppm is the carboxylic acid. So the parent structure is a benzoic acid derivative. The other protons: \n\nStarting from the end, the 0.9 ppm triplet is the methyl group (since terminal CH3 gives a triplet for the adjacent CH2). The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) would be a CH3 at the end of a chain. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is probably a methyl group that's attached to a carbon with a neighboring proton. Since it's a doublet, maybe a CH(CH3) group, like an isopropyl?",
