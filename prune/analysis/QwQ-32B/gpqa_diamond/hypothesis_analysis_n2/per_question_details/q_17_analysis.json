But the question is asking for the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ ions. Because even if all the EDTA and Ca\u00b2+ initially reacted, some of the complex would dissociate. \n\nSo, the formation constant K is very large (5e10), which means the complex is very stable. But since K is given, maybe I need to write the expression and solve for [Ca\u00b2+].\n\nThe formation constant expression is K = [CaY\u00b2\u207b] / ([Ca\u00b2+][Y\u2074\u207b]).",

The reaction is Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4- \u2194 CaEDTA\u00b2-. The formation constant expression would be Kf = [CaEDTA\u00b2-]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-]). Since the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA\u00b2-, that's the concentration of the complex.
