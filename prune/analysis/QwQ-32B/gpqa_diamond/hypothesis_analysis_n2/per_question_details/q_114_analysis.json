          "text1": "Wait, actually, when forming a cyanohydrin from a ketone and cyanide, the reaction is usually done in the presence of an acid catalyst. Let me remember: the mechanism is that the ketone carbonyl is attacked by the cyanide ion. Then, the intermediate is a tetrahedral intermediate with the CN- attached. But to form the cyanohydrin, perhaps the next step is adding water or protonating.",
          "text2": "Wait, no, the cyanohydrin formation is when the nucleophile (CN-) adds to the carbonyl, and then protonation. The mechanism is: the ketone's carbonyl is attacked by CN-, forming an intermediate. Then, the H+ from reagent A would protonate the oxygen, leading to the cyanohydrin. So the reagent A here must provide the H+, so probably a strong acid like H3O+ (from H+/water). So in the first reaction, A is H3O+.\n\nLooking at the options, A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have NaHSO3. So if the first step requires acid (H3O+), then options C and D are out for A. So the answer must be between A and B.\n\nNow the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (in H2O) gives the acid. The nitrile group is being converted to a carboxylic acid. How do you convert nitrile to carboxylic acid? Typically, you can hydrolyze nitriles under acidic or basic conditions.",

The product is the same except the nitrile becomes a carboxylic acid. So converting a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. The reagents for that are typically aqueous acid (like HCl or H2SO4) or base (like NaOH) but for nitriles, hydrolysis under acidic conditions gives carboxylic acids, while under basic gives amides.",
