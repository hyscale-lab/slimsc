          "text1": "Wait, simply rationalizing: 6/sqrt(3) = (6\u221a3)/3 = 2\u221a3 \u22483.464. \n\nSo total energy is 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964, which rounds to 5.96 mc\u00b2. So the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc\u00b2, so the correct option is C. \n\nLooking at the options, option C has v_rel =0.14c and E=5.96 mc\u00b2. Option D has the same velocity but lower energy. So the answer must be C.",

The other options: A's v is 1.1c which is over c, impossible. B's v is 0.1c, which is the naive subtraction, but the relativistic calculation gives higher denominator, so the numerator over denominator is smaller than 0.1c?",
