Let me write it out properly:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8| P_z\u00b2 |\u03c8\u27e9 = (conjugate of first component of \u03c8) * (first component of P_z\u00b2 \u03c8) + ... \n\nThe state is real, so conjugates don't matter here. \n\nSo first term: (-1/2) * (\u0127\u00b2*(-1/2)) = (-1/2)( -\u0127\u00b2/2 ) = (\u0127\u00b2/4)\n\nSecond term: (1/\u221a2)*0 = 0\n\nThird term: (-1/2)*( \u0127\u00b2*(-1/2) ) = (-1/2)( -\u0127\u00b2/2 ) = \u0127\u00b2/4\n\nAdding them all: \u0127\u00b2/4 + 0 + \u0127\u00b2/4 = \u0127\u00b2/2",

The diagonal elements are the eigenvalues, so each term in the sum is the (i-th component of \u03c8)* times (the i-th eigenvalue) times (the i-th component of \u03c8). \n\nSo let's compute each term:\n\nThe components of |\u03c8\u27e9 are:\n\n\u03c8\u2081 = -1/2,\n\n\u03c8\u2082 = 1/\u221a2,\n\n\u03c8\u2083 = -1/2.\n\nThe eigenvalues for each basis state (since they are the P_z eigenvectors):\n\nFirst basis state (first component) has eigenvalue \u0127,\n\nSecond basis state (second component) has eigenvalue 0,\n\nThird basis state (third component) has eigenvalue -\u0127.\n\nTherefore:\n\n\u27e8P_z\u27e9 = |\u03c8\u2081|\u00b2 * \u0127 + |\u03c8\u2082|\u00b2 * 0 + |\u03c8\u2083|\u00b2 * (-\u0127)\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n|\u03c8\u2081|\u00b2 is ( (-1/2)^2 ) = 1/4,\n\n|\u03c8\u2082|\u00b2 is (1/\u221a2)^2 = 1/2,\n\n|\u03c8\u2083|\u00b2 is ( (-1/2)^2 ) = 1/4.\n\nSo,\n\n\u27e8P_z\u27e9 = (1/4)(\u0127) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-\u0127) \n\nThat simplifies to (1/4 - 1/4)\u0127 + 0 \u2192 0.",
