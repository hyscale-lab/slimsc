So first, we need to find the eigenstates of A, then take inner products.\n\nLet me find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A. The matrix A is [[0, hbar/2],[hbar/2, 0]]. Let's find its eigenvalues. The characteristic equation is det(A - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nSo determinant of [ -\u03bb, hbar/2 ; hbar/2, -\u03bb ] = \u03bb\u00b2 - (hbar/2)^2 =0 \u2192 \u03bb = \u00b1 hbar/2. So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2. The corresponding eigenvectors can be found by solving (A - \u03bbI)v =0.\n\nFor \u03bb = hbar/2: the matrix becomes [ -hbar/2, hbar/2; hbar/2, -hbar/2 ] \u2192 each row reduces to -v1 + v2 =0 \u2192 v1 = v2. So the eigenvector is proportional to (1,1). Similarly for \u03bb=-hbar/2: the matrix becomes [ hbar/2, hbar/2; hbar/2, hbar/2 ] \u2192 each row gives v1 + v2 =0 \u2192 v1 = -v2. So eigenvectors are (1,-1). \n\nTherefore, the eigenstates of A are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), since they need to be normalized.",

Similarly for |-x>.\n\nGiven that |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2\u2212i)|down> normalized by 1/\u221a7.\n\nFirst, let's compute the inner product \u27e8+x| alpha\u27e9.\n\nExpress \u27e8+x| in terms of the up and down basis. Since |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/\u221a2, then the bra is \u27e8+x| = (\u27e8up| + \u27e8down|)/\u221a2.\n\nThus,\n\n\u27e8+x| alpha\u27e9 = [ (\u27e8up| + \u27e8down|)/\u221a2 ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2\u2212i)|down> ] / \u221a7.\n\nMultiplying out, we get:\n\n[ (1+i)\u27e8up|up> + (2\u2212i)\u27e8down|down> + (1+i)\u27e8up|down> + (2\u2212i)\u27e8down|up> ) / (\u221a2 * \u221a7) ]\n\nBut \u27e8up|down> and \u27e8down|up> are zero because they're orthogonal. So those terms vanish. The remaining terms are (1+i) and (2\u2212i). Since \u27e8up|up> and \u27e8down|down> are 1, so:\n\n[ (1+i) + (2\u2212i) ] / (\u221a2 * \u221a7 )\n\nSimplify numerator: (1+i +2 -i) = 3. So numerator is 3, denominator sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) = sqrt(14).\n\nTherefore, \u27e8+x|alpha\u27e9 = 3 / sqrt(14). Then the probability is |3/sqrt(14)|\u00b2 = 9/14 \u22480.642857.

After normalization, it's:\n\n|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>\n\nLet me compute the inner product with |+> first.\n\n\u27e8+ | alpha\u27e9 = \u27e8+ | [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7)|down> ]\n\nSince \u27e8+ | is (\u27e8up| + \u27e8down|)/sqrt(2), so:\n\n= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) \u27e8up|up\u27e9 + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) \u27e8down|down\u27e9 ]\n\nSince \u27e8up|up\u27e9 =1 and \u27e8down|down\u27e9=1, so:\n\n= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i + 2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]\n\nSimplify the terms inside the brackets: 1 +i +2 -i = 3. So:\n\n= (1/sqrt(2)) * (3 / sqrt(7)) = 3/(sqrt(14))\n\nThe probability is the square of the absolute value of this. Since it's a real number (the coefficients led to a real result?),",
