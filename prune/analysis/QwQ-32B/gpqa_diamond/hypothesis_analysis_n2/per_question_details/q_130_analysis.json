          "text1": "Wait, but for the detection, the observed wavelength must be above the atmospheric cutoff. The Earth's atmosphere doesn't let UV through below ~300 nm (3000 \u00c5). So the minimal observed wavelength must be above 3000 \u00c5. So in that case, solving for z when observed is 3000:\n\nz = (3000/1216) -1 \u2248 (3000/1216)= ~2.466 \u2013 1 gives 1.466. So redshift z must be at least ~1.47. The question says \"lower limit\", so the minimal z where it can be detected. So if the redshift is less than that, then the observed wavelength is less than 3000 \u00c5, hence cannot be detected. Therefore the lower limit is z \u22481.47. The options given are B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. The closest would be D)1.9? No, 1.47 is between B and D. Since 1.47 is higher than B (1.2) but lower than D (1.9).",
          "text2": "Alternatively, maybe the visible spectrum is considered to be from 400 nm (4000 \u00c5) to 700 nm, so the cutoff is at 4000 \u00c5. Then the required z is 2.29, so the closest is 2.4 (C) as the lower limit. Because if the redshift is exactly 2.29, then it's just on the edge. So the lower limit would be approximately z=2.29, so the first option above that would be 2.4. But the question says \"lower limit\", so perhaps the minimal z that allows detection is just when the wavelength is at 4000 \u00c5. So the answer is that the lower limit is z\u22482.29, which is option C (2.4). Since the question asks for the lower limit, the minimal z required is around that. So the answer must be C) 2.4.",
