The structure here would have the cyclohexanone part connected to a benzaldehyde part. \n\nThe aldol product structure: the enolate from cyclohexanone (which is the ketone) attacks the aldehyde's carbonyl. The enolate (from cyclohexanone) has an oxygen with a negative charge. So the oxygen attacks the carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde. The benzaldehyde's oxygen becomes a hydroxyl group, and the cyclohexanone's \u03b1 carbon becomes the \u03b2 position. The overall structure would be a \u03b2-hydroxy ketone.",
