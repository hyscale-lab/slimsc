          "text1": "Wait, perhaps numbering differently, but the key point is that the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, and the two COOCH3 groups are on carbons 1 and 4. \n\nBut regardless of the structure, the question is whether dimethyl fumarate can have optical isomers. Since fumaric acid is the trans isomer, its dimethyl ester would also be trans. However, optical isomerism requires a chiral center.",
          "text2": "Wait, no. Let me get this right. Fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is:\n\nOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3 instead of a single bond. So the correct structure is:\n\nHOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the two carboxyl groups are on carbons 1 and 4 (if the double bond is between 2 and 3). \n\nNow, when it's dimethyl fumarate, both carboxylic acids are esterified with methyl groups. So the structure would be OOCMe-CH=CH-COOMe (where Me is methyl). \n\nNow, can this have optical isomerism? Well, the molecule is a trans diene. The two methyl esters are on the same side?",

          "text1": "Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the structure of option2. \n\nOption2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. The middle carbon (position2) has substituents: CH3 (from first carbon), COOCH3 (third carbon), OH, and a hydrogen. So four different groups. Thus, it's a chiral center. So yes, it has optical isomerism. \n\nOption4: dimethyl fumarate has no chiral center. \n\nOption1 has no chiral center. \n\nSo the correct answer would be option2 only, but none of the options have that.",
          "text2": "Alternatively, let's consider that the molecule has no chiral centers, so no optical isomerism. Hence, option 4 (dimethyl fumarate) does not have optical isomerism. \n\nSo the only compound with optical isomerism is option 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate), which has a chiral center at the second carbon. \n\nLooking back at the options, the correct answer should be D) 1 and 2?",
