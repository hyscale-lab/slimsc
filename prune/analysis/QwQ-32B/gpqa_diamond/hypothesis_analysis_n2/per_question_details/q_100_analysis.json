          "text1": "Wait, no, the question says bromination without mentioning HBr. Oh, right, when alkenes react with Br2, it's a diaddition, so the product would be 1,2-dibromopropane. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane.\n\nNext step: compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a condition for elimination reactions, like dehydrohalogenation. Since B is 1,2-dibromopropane, reacting with alcoholic KOH would remove both Br groups and form an alkene again?",
          "text2": "Wait, actually, for bromination of alkenes using Br2 as the reagent, the bromine adds across the double bond, so it would form 1,2-dibromopropane. So for propene, the product would be 1,2-dibromopropane. So compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane.\n\nThen, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, so that's probably an elimination reaction. For a dibromide, the elimination would lead to an alkene. Let me think: when you have a 1,2-dibromide, like BrCH2CHBrCH3, and you treat it with KOH, the bromine would leave as Br- (since KOH is basic), and the elimination would occur to form an alkene. The product here would be the alkene.",
