Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s, c is 3e8 m/s. So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8)/(0.21) = approx (1.9878e-25)/(0.21) \u2248 9.46e-25 J. Convert that to eV: 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J, so dividing 9.46e-25 / 1.6e-19 \u2248 5.9e-6 eV. Oh, so that's about 5.9 microelectron volts. The question's value is 3.9, which is lower. Hmm.",

But the absorption line observed in the Milky Way would be at our local velocity, so the redshift doesn't affect the Milky Way's own absorption. The question says \"observed with this absorption line in the Milky Way\", so the energy given is the rest frame energy of the Milky Way's absorption. \n\nHmm.",

The source at 2.1 Gpc would have a significant redshift, but the absorption line in the Milky Way would be at a different redshift. So the observed energy (in our frame) would be the rest energy of the Milky Way's ISM, so the given energy is the rest energy. \n\nHmm.",
