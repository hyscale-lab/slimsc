But the key point here is the expression of eGFP. \n\nThe question is why there's no green (eGFP from receptor-eGFP). Let me think: the receptor's eGFP is behind a stop in lox2272-stop-lox2272. To remove that stop, Cre must recombine those sites. Since the Cre is present (from SOX10-Cre), that should happen. But maybe there's a problem with the orientation? Because loxP and lox2272 are in different orientations, but the question states that the stop is between the receptor and the eGFP in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So the two lox2272 sites are on either side of the stop. So Cre would recombine them, flipping the orientation and removing the stop?",
          "text2": "Wait, the mice being crossed are SOX10-Cre hemizygous. The SOX10 promoter drives Cre expression. Since the stop in the receptor-eGFP is between lox2272 sites, Cre might not be able to remove that stop unless the Cre is a variant like Cre-ERT2. But the question says they used standard Cre. The loxP and lox2272 are different, so Cre can only remove the stop between ligand and mCherry (loxP sites). The receptor-eGFP's stop is in lox2272, which Cre can't recombine. So the receptor and eGFP wouldn't be in frame, so the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. That would explain no green signal.",
