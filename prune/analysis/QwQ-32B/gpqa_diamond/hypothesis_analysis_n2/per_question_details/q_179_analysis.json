Therefore, multiplying by e^X could change the norm. \n\nSo option A says there exists a vector where multiplying by e^X changes the norm. Since e^X is not unitary, then yes, multiplying by it would change the norm of some vectors. For example, if the matrix isn't unitary, then there exists a vector v such that ||e^X v|| \u2260 ||v||.

If e^X is a unitary matrix, then multiplying any vector by it would preserve the norm. So if e^X is unitary, then this statement would be false. So we need to check if X is Hermitian. Because if X is Hermitian, then e^X would be unitary (since e^{iH} is unitary if H is Hermitian, but wait, actually, the exponential of a Hermitian matrix H would be e^{H}, which is not necessarily unitary.",
