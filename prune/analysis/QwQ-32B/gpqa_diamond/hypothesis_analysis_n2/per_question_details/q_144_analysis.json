Hmm, maybe a better approach is to calculate \u03c4 in seconds first.\n\nFirst, \u0393 is in MeV. Let's convert \u0393 to Hz (cycles per second) or to inverse seconds. The relation between energy and frequency is E = h\u03bd, so \u03bd = E/h. So \u0393 (as an energy) corresponds to a frequency of \u0393/h. But since \u0393 is the energy width, then \u0393 in Hz would be \u0393/(h).",

Because \u0393 is the inverse lifetime (in energy terms?), but let me check the units.\n\nLet me see: The unit of \u0393 is GeV (or MeV). The unit of \u0127 is J\u00b7s. So if \u0393 is in MeV, converting to Joules: 1 MeV is 1.60218e-13 J. Then, \u03c4 = (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s) / (\u0393 in J). \n\nBut maybe this is getting complicated.",
          "text2": "Wait, let's see. Let me recall that \u0393 (the width) is related to the inverse lifetime. So \u03c4 = (\u0127)/(2\u0393). But in natural units where \u0127 = c = 1, but here we need to use actual units. Let me recall that in SI units, \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718\u00d710^-34 J\u00b7s. But since the energies are given in GeV and MeV, maybe it's easier to use natural units where \u0127c = 197.327 MeV\u00b7fm (since 1 fm = 1e-15 m).",
