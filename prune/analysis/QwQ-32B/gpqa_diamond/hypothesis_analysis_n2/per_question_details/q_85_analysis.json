Maybe I need to use Kepler's third law.\n\nKepler's third law states that (P^2)/(a^3) = 4 \u03c0\u00b2/(G(M_star + M_p))\n\nAssuming that M_p << M_star, which is probably true here since the planets are 5 and 7 Earth masses, and the star is 1.5 solar masses. So M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star.\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (2 \u03c0 G / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) P^(1/3) )) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( sqrt(1 - e\u00b2) ) ) \n\nBut since e=0, that term is 1. And if M_p << M_star, then M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. Let's ignore the sin i term for now, since it's the same for both planets (assuming the inclination is the same, but the problem doesn't specify, but since both are detected by RV and transit, then sin i would be known via transit depth?",
          "text2": "perhaps another way. The radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:\n\nK = ( (G M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) (a)^(2) ) )^(1/3) ) ... No, maybe better to use the simplified version.\n\nAssuming that the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (which is likely, as the star is 1.5 solar masses, and the planets are 5 and 7 Earth masses. Earth is about 3e-6 solar masses, so 5 Earth masses would be ~1.5e-5 solar masses, much smaller than 1.5. So we can approximate M_* + M_p \u2248 M_*, so the formula simplifies.\n\nThe standard formula is:\n\nK = ( (G (M_p) sin i ) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) (a)^(2) ) )^(1/3) )? Not sure. Let me recall: \n\nThe formula for K is:\n\nK = ( ( G (M_p) ) / ( (M_* sin i)^(2/3) (a)^(2) ) )^(1/3) )? Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of Kepler's third law.\n\nKepler's third law in terms of the star-planet system: \n\n( (a)^3 ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2) ) ) = (P^2) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 G) \n\nBut since M_p << M_*, this simplifies to:\n\na^3 / M_*^2 ~ P^2 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 G) \n\nBut rearranged, perhaps better to express the orbital period in terms of a.",
