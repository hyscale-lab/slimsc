          "text1": "Wait, moving to the second compound in option D: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let's see its methyl groups. Methyls at positions1,2,3,5. Are these equivalent? Let's see. The arrangement is 1,2,3 (three adjacent), and position5. The symmetry here is different. Let me try to see equivalence:\n\nPosition1,2,3 are all adjacent methyls. Position5 is across from where? Position5 is opposite position2? Not sure. Let's see:\n\nThe four methyl groups are at 1,2,3,5. The remaining H's are at4 and6. Let's look for symmetry. The molecule might not have much symmetry. For example:\n\nPositions1,2,3 are methyls, so they form a block. Position5 is another methyl. The remaining H's are at4 and6. \n\nThe methyl at position5 is adjacent to position4 (H) and position6 (H?), wait no. Let me think again. Position5 is between 4 and6. Since positions4 and6 have H's (as the remaining). \n\nLooking at the methyl groups:\n\nMethyl at position1: adjacent to position2 (methyl) and position6 (H?",
          "text2": "Wait position5 is next to 4 and 6? Let me get this straight. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe instead of trying to figure out each compound's symmetry, let's think of how many distinct methyl groups each compound would have.\n\nFor 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (first part of option D):\n\nThe methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are para, so they are equivalent. Similarly, the methyl groups at 2 and 5 are also para. So two types of methyl groups. So two signals for their methyl groups.\n\nThe second compound, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:\n\nThe methyl groups are at 1,2,3,5. Let's see:\n\nPositions 1,2,3 are consecutive. The methyl at position 3 is adjacent to 2 (methyl) and 4 (H). The methyl at position 5 is across from 2. The methyl at position 1 is adjacent to 6 (H) and 2 (methyl). \n\nSo the methyl at 1 is in a different environment than the methyl at 3 and 5. The methyl at 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3 (both substituted except position 1 and 3 have methyls). The methyl at 5 is adjacent to 4 (H) and 6 (H?), but actually position 6 is adjacent to 5 and 1.",
