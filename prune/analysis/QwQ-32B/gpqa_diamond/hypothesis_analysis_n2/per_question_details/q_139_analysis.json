Usually, oxidation of 1,2-diol with strong oxidizing agents like chromic acid might form a glycolic acid, but maybe under certain conditions, it can form a diketone? Or perhaps the methoxy group is part of a protecting group. Let me think again.",

Let's consider each product again.\n\nThe first product is 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione. So two ketones at positions 1 and 2.
