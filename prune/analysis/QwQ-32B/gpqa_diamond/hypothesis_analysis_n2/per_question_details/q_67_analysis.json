          "text1": "Alternatively, let me think of the possible combinations. The M=-1 state must be a normalized combination of |-1,0\u27e9 and |0,-1\u27e9. The simplest case is that both coefficients are equal, so they each have sqrt(1/2). \n\nIf that's the case, then the expansion would be ( |-1,0\u27e9 + |0,-1\u27e9 ) / sqrt(2). \n\nIf that's true, then the coefficients for each term are sqrt(1/2). \n\nTherefore, when expanding the given state, the coefficients for the two terms are each sqrt(1/2). \n\nTherefore, the probability amplitude for the term |-1,0\u27e9 would be sqrt(1/2), so the probability would be (sqrt(1/2))\u00b2 = 1/2. Similarly for the |0,-1\u27e9 term. But the question is asking for the joint probability of getting both L1z and L2z as -\u0127. That would correspond to the term where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.",
          "text2": "Wait, but what about m1 = -1 and m2 = -1? Then their sum would be -2. But m_total here is -1, so that pair isn't part of this state. \n\nTherefore, the state |1,1,2,-1> must be a combination of the |m1,m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1. \n\nThe coefficients of these terms in the coupled state determine the probability amplitudes. The question is, in the expansion of |1,1,2,-1>, what is the coefficient of the term |m1=-1, m2=-1>?",
