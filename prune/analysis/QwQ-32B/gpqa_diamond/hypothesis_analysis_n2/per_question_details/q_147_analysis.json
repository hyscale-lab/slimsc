Therefore, the total momentum after annihilation must also be small.

          "text2": "Wait, actually, the total energy must equal the initial energy. Since the particles are created from the annihilation, their total energy (including rest mass) must equal the initial energy. So let's think in terms of conservation of energy. Let me formalize this.\n\nThe initial particles are a proton and antiproton. Their rest mass energy is each 938 MeV, so total 2*938 = 1876 MeV. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is negligible, so the total initial energy is just the sum of their rest masses, so 1876 MeV. \n\nAfter annihilation, we have four particles: two A+ and two A-. Each has rest mass m_A c\u00b2 = 300 MeV. So the total rest mass energy of the four particles is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. The remaining energy (1876 - 1200) = 676 MeV must be the total kinetic energy of these four particles. \n\nBut to find the velocity of particle A, I think we need to consider the kinetic energy of each particle. But since the particles are produced in pairs, perhaps they move symmetrically. Also, the system's total momentum must be conserved. Since the initial momentum is the antiproton's momentum, but if it's moving slowly, the initial momentum is negligible.",

          "text1": "Wait, let me think again. If the antiproton is slowly moving, perhaps the proton is at rest. Let me consider that scenario. Let's suppose the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has a very small velocity, so that its momentum is negligible. Then, the total initial momentum is approximately the momentum of the antiproton. But since it's moving slowly, that momentum is much smaller than its rest mass energy.",

But if the proton is at rest, then the initial momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, its momentum is approximately its rest mass times its velocity, but relativistically, p = gamma m v. But if velocity is small, then gamma is approximately 1, so p \u2248 m v. But since it's moving slowly, maybe the momentum is small compared to the rest mass energy. Hmm, but the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so perhaps we can assume that its kinetic energy is negligible, so that the total energy is just the sum of the rest masses of the proton and antiproton plus their kinetic energies. Since the antiproton's kinetic energy is negligible, then the total initial energy is (m_p + m_p) c\u00b2, since proton and antiproton have the same mass.",
