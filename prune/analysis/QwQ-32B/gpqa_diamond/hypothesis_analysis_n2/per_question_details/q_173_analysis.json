          "text1": "Wait, energy uncertainty. Hmm, how does momentum uncertainty translate into energy uncertainty? Well, the kinetic energy of the electron is (p\u00b2)/(2m). So if there's an uncertainty in p, then the uncertainty in energy would be related to the derivative of the energy with respect to p, multiplied by \u0394p. That sounds like using calculus for error propagation.\n\nLet me write that down. The energy E is (p\u00b2)/(2m), so the uncertainty in E would be approximately dE/dp * \u0394p. The derivative of E with respect to p is (2p)/(2m) = p/m. Therefore, \u0394E \u2248 (p/m) * \u0394p.",
