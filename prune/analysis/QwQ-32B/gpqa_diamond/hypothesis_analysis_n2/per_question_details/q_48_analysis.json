The carbonyl (C=O) would add Br across the double bond. The mechanism would involve the oxygen attacking Br2, forming a bromonium ion, then another Br- attacks, leading to a 1,2-dibromo compound. The product would be a 1,2-dibromocyclohexane?",

Let me try to proceed with that assumption, even if I'm not 100% sure, and see if the subsequent steps make sense. \n\nSuppose cyclohexanone (C6H10O) when treated with Br2 forms product 1 as a 1,2-dibromo compound. So the carbonyl group (C=O) becomes a CHBr2 group, and the oxygen becomes part of a CHBr-O bond?",
