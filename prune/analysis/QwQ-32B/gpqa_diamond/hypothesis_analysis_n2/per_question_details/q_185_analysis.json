          "text1": "Wait, let me think again. Suppose the operator is H = \u03b5*(\u03c3\u00b7n). The \u03c3\u00b7n operator has eigenvalues \u00b11, so when multiplied by \u03b5, the eigenvalues become \u00b1\u03b5. So yes, that's exactly what option B says.",
          "text2": "Wait, no. Let me do it more carefully.\n\nLet me compute (\u03c3\u00b7n)^2. Let\u2019s denote S = \u03c3\u00b7n. Then S\u00b2 = (\u03c3\u00b7n)(\u03c3\u00b7n) = \u03c3_i n_i \u03c3_j n_j (using Einstein summation). Then, using \u03c3_i \u03c3_j = \u03b4_ij I + i\u03b5_{ijk}\u03c3_k. So substituting that in, we get S\u00b2 = n_i n_j (\u03b4_ij I + i \u03b5_{ijk} \u03c3_k). The first term is \u03b4_ij n_i n_j I = (n\u00b7n)I. Since n is a unit vector, that's I. The second term is i \u03b5_{ijk} n_i n_j \u03c3_k. But the \u03b5_{ijk} term is antisymmetric in i and j, while n_i n_j is symmetric. So their product is zero. Therefore, S\u00b2 = I. So S squared equals the identity matrix. Therefore, the eigenvalues of S must satisfy \u03bb\u00b2 = 1, so \u03bb = \u00b11. So the eigenvalues of \u03c3\u00b7n are indeed +1 and -1.\n\nTherefore, the Hamiltonian H is \u03b5 multiplied by that operator. So if S has eigenvalues \u00b11, then H = \u03b5 S will have eigenvalues \u03b5*(\u00b11) = \u00b1\u03b5. So the eigenvalues are +\u03b5 and -\u03b5, which is option B.",

Since \u03c3_i^2 = I for each i, the terms where i=j contribute n_i^2 I. The cross terms where i\u2260j will have \u03c3_i \u03c3_j, which is equal to i\u03b5_{ijk}\u03c3_k + \u03b4_{ij}I.",
