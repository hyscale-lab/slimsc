The resolution needs to be small enough to resolve that distance. But let me think more carefully.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the proper lifetime \u03c4\u2080 is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. In the lab frame, the lifetime is \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). To compute \u03b3, we need the particle's velocity. Since we have the energy and mass of X\u2070, perhaps we can find the velocity from that.\n\nEnergy (E) of the particle in the lab frame is given as 27 GeV. The mass (m) is 3.41 GeV.
