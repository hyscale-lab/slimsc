          "text1": "Wait, actually, the HPO4^2- can dissociate into PO4^3-, so the actual [HPO4^2-] is slightly less than 0.02808, but since Ka3 is so small, that change is negligible. So we can approximate [HPO4^2-] \u2248 0.02808 M.\n\nBut we need [H+]. To find [H+], we can consider the buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which is governed by the second dissociation (Ka2). \n\nThe pH of the solution can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\npKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) \u2248 7.207 (since log(6.2) is ~0.792, so 8 - 0.792 is about 7.208?)",
          "text2": "Wait, no, pKa2 = -log(Ka2) = -log(6.2e-8). Let me compute that. \n\nCalculating pKa2: log(6.2e-8) is log(6.2) + log(1e-8) \u2248 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076, so pKa2 \u2248 7.2076. \n\nThe ratio of [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is (0.028085)/(0.03673) \u2248 0.764. Taking the log of that gives log(0.764) \u2248 -0.117. \n\nSo pH = pKa2 + log(0.764) \u2248 7.2076 -0.117 \u2248 7.09. \n\nSo the pH is around 7.09. \n\nNow, to find the concentration of PO4^3-, we need to look at the third dissociation: HPO4^2- \u21cc H+ + PO4^3-. The equilibrium expression is Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]. \n\nSolving for [PO4^3-], we get [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+].\n\nWe know Ka3 is 1.8e-12. The [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.028085 M (but actually, in the solution, some of HPO4^2- might dissociate to form PO4^3-, but since Ka3 is so small, that's probably negligible compared to the initial concentration. So we can approximate [HPO4^2-] as 0.028085 M. \n\n[H+] is 10^-pH. Since pH is 7.09, [H+] = 10^-7.09 \u2248 8.13e-8 M. \n\nPlugging into the equation: \n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / 8.13e-8 \n\nLet me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst, 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = 1.8 * 0.028085 = 0.050553e-12?",
