That compound has a benzene ring with two methyl groups on 2 and 4 positions, and a vinylsulfinyl group attached to position 1. The vinylsulfinyl part is a vinyl group (C=C) attached to a sulfinyl group (SO). The structure would be: the benzene has a -S(O)CH2-CH2? No, wait, the vinylsulfinyl would be more like a vinyl group (C=C) where one end is attached to the sulfur. So maybe the structure is benzene-1-yl-S(O)-CH2-CH2?",
