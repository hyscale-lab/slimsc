          "text1": "Wait, perhaps I need to model the brightness variation when the star rotates. Since only one hemisphere has spots, when the star rotates so that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the visible area has spots, contributing less light. The amplitude of the variation is between the minimum (when the spots are facing us) and maximum (when the unspotted hemisphere is facing). \n\nSo the average flux when the spots are facing us would be from the spots and the non-spotted regions. Let me think in terms of the fractional change in flux.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet Teff be the star's effective temperature (6000 K), T_spot = Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K.\n\nThe flux from a spot is proportional to T_spot^4, and the rest of the star's flux is proportional to Teff^4.\n\nSuppose when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the fraction of the visible disk covered by spots is the filling factor, 20% (0.2). The other 80% is at the higher temperature.",
          "text2": "Wait, the problem states \"one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.\" Hmm, so the filling factor is 20%, meaning that 20% of the area of that hemisphere is covered by spots. So the other 80% of that hemisphere is normal. The opposite hemisphere has no spots.\n\nTherefore, when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer, the visible area (which is a hemisphere) has 20% spots and 80% normal. When the other hemisphere is facing us, there are no spots. The brightness variation comes from the difference between those two states.\n\nSo, the total flux when the spots are visible would be:\n\nFlux_spotty = (Area_normal * L_normal + Area_spots * L_spots) / (Total visible area)\n\nBut let's think in terms of fractions. Let me define variables.\n\nThe total flux from the star when the spotted hemisphere is facing us: the visible hemisphere has a fraction f = 0.2 spots and (1 - f) = 0.8 normal.\n\nThe luminosity contribution from the normal part of that hemisphere is (0.8)*(T_eff)^4, and from the spots it's (0.2)*(T_spot)^4. But since the Stefan-Boltzmann law gives L \u221d T^4, so the total flux when the spots are visible would be proportional to (0.8*T_eff^4 + 0.2*T_spot^4). \n\nWhen the other hemisphere is facing, the visible part has no spots, so the flux is proportional to T_eff^4. \n\nThe difference in flux between the two states is the amplitude of the variation. The amplitude (\u0394F) would be the difference between the maximum and minimum flux divided by the average, but since it's periodic, the amplitude is the difference between the two states divided by the average.",
