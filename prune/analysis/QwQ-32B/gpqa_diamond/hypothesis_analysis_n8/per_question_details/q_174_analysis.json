The initial nucleus is at rest, so its total energy is just its rest mass energy, 300 GeV. After fission, each fragment has kinetic energy plus their rest mass energy. Therefore, the total energy after fission must equal the initial 300 GeV. The sum of rest masses is 0.99 M, so their rest mass energy is 0.99 * 300 = 297 GeV. The remaining 3 GeV should be the total kinetic energy of the two fragments. So T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.\n\nNow, the fragments have a mass ratio of 2:1. Let's say the mass of the lighter fragment is m, so the heavier is 2m. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta for momentum conservation. So the magnitudes of their momenta must be equal. Let's denote the momentum of the lighter fragment as p, then the heavier one must have the same magnitude p but opposite direction. \n\nSo, momentum conservation gives that their momenta are equal in magnitude. The momentum of each fragment is related to their velocities, but since kinetic energy might be relativistic, we can't just use classical formulas.",
          "text2": "Wait, maybe the problem is about the difference between relativistic and non-relativistic calculations for the kinetic energy. Since the particles might be moving at speeds where relativistic effects are important, so their kinetic energy formulas would differ. However, the problem mentions the sum of rest masses is 99% of M. The total energy before and after must be conserved. Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. \n\nLet me start by breaking down the problem step by step. \n\nLet me denote the rest masses of the two fragments as m1 and m2. The problem says one is twice as massive as the other. Let's say the more massive fragment is m1 = 2*m2. The sum m1 + m2 = 0.99*M. \n\nSo substituting m1 = 2*m2, we get 2m2 + m2 = 3m2 = 0.99*M \u2192 m2 = (0.99/3)*M = 0.33*M. Then m1 is 0.66*M. \n\nThe initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV (since M is the mass, so mass-energy is M c\u00b2 = 300 GeV). The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 0.99*M, so their rest mass energy is 0.99*300 GeV = 297 GeV. \n\nThe energy released in the fission is the difference between the initial and the rest mass energy of the fragments. So that energy is 3 GeV (since 300 - 297 = 3 GeV). This energy is converted into kinetic energy of the two fragments. \n\nSince the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. Therefore, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. So, p1 = -p2. \n\nTherefore, the magnitudes of their momenta are equal. Let me denote the momentum of m1 as p, then m2 must have -p. \n\nThe kinetic energy of each fragment can be calculated using relativistic or classical formulas. The question is, what's the difference between the actual (relativistic) T1 and the classical T1. \n\nFirst, let's compute the classical case. \n\nIn the classical case, kinetic energy is (p\u00b2)/(2m). Since their momenta have the same magnitude, but masses are different. \n\nLet me denote m1 = 2m2, so let me write m2 = m, so m1 = 2m. \n\nSince momentum is the same in magnitude, p = sqrt(2 m T) for each.",

Hmm, maybe not exactly, but let's think.\n\nSince the nucleus is at rest initially, the total momentum of the fragments must be zero. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. So their velocities (or momenta) must be such that the vector sum is zero. Since their masses are different, their speeds must be different. Let me denote the masses as m1 = 2m and m2 = m. The initial momentum is zero, so m1*v1 + m2*v2 = 0.

Let me think.\n\nThe initial rest mass energy is M c\u00b2. After fission, the total energy is (m1 c\u00b2 + T1) + (m2 c\u00b2 + T2). The total energy must equal the initial energy (since energy is conserved). So:\n\nM c\u00b2 = (m1 c\u00b2 + T1) + (m2 c\u00b2 + T2)\n\nWe know m1 + m2 = 0.99 M, so the rest mass terms add to 0.99 M c\u00b2. Thus,\n\nT1 + T2 = M c\u00b2 - 0.99 M c\u00b2 = 0.01 M c\u00b2, which matches what I had before.\n\nTherefore, the total kinetic energy is indeed 0.01 M c\u00b2. The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment in the relativistic vs classical calculation.\n\nIn the classical case, as I found, T1 is 1/3 of that total, so (1/3)*0.01 M c\u00b2.\n\nIn the relativistic case, we have to consider that momentum conservation still requires the magnitudes of their momenta to be equal. Let me write equations for the relativistic case.\n\nThe momentum of each fragment is p and -p. For the more massive fragment (mass m1 = 2m2), its momentum is p = gamma1 * m1 v1, and the other fragment's momentum is p = gamma2 * m2 v2. But since they are in opposite directions, their magnitudes are equal:\n\ngamma1 * m1 v1 = gamma2 * m2 v2.\n\nAdditionally, their velocities are in opposite directions, so the direction is accounted for in the sign, but the magnitudes must satisfy the above equation.\n\nAlso, from the conservation of energy, T1 + T2 = 0.01 M c\u00b2.\n\nBut since m1 = 2 m2, let me substitute variables.\n\nLet me denote m2 = m, so m1 = 2m. Then, the momentum equation becomes:\n\ngamma1 * 2m v1 = gamma2 * m v2 \u2192 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.\n\nAlso, the velocities v1 and v2 must be in opposite directions, but their magnitudes' relation comes from the momentum equation.\n\nAdditionally, the kinetic energies are T1 = (gamma1 -1) 2m c\u00b2, T2 = (gamma2 -1) m c\u00b2.\n\nSo T1 + T2 = (gamma1 -1) 2m c\u00b2 + (gamma2 -1) m c\u00b2 = 2m (gamma1 -1)c\u00b2 + m (gamma2 -1)c\u00b2 = m c\u00b2 [ 2(gamma1 -1) + (gamma2 -1) ]\n\nThis should equal 0.01 M c\u00b2. Since M = 3m / 0.99, so substituting M = (3m)/(0.99). Therefore, 0.01 M c\u00b2 = 0.01*(3m /0.99) c\u00b2 = (0.03 m /0.99) c\u00b2 = (0.0303...) m c\u00b2.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit messy.

We need to compute T1 in two ways: relativistic and classical, then find the difference between them.\n\nFirst, let's handle the classical case. In classical physics, momentum conservation applies. Since the initial momentum is zero, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. So p1 = -p2. The masses are m1 and m2. Let me denote m1 = 2m2. Let me call m2 = m, so m1 =2m. Then, the total momentum is zero: m1 v1 + m2 v2 =0 \u2192 2m v1 + m v2 =0 \u2192 2v1 + v2 =0. So v2 = -2v1. The velocities are opposite.\n\nThe kinetic energy of each fragment is (1/2)m v\u00b2.

Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. \n\nLet me start by breaking down the problem step by step. \n\nLet me denote the rest masses of the two fragments as m1 and m2. The problem says one is twice as massive as the other. Let's say the more massive fragment is m1 = 2*m2. The sum m1 + m2 = 0.99*M. \n\nSo substituting m1 = 2*m2, we get 2m2 + m2 = 3m2 = 0.99*M \u2192 m2 = (0.99/3)*M = 0.33*M. Then m1 is 0.66*M. \n\nThe initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV (since M is the mass, so mass-energy is M c\u00b2 = 300 GeV). The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 0.99*M, so their rest mass energy is 0.99*300 GeV = 297 GeV. \n\nThe energy released in the fission is the difference between the initial and the rest mass energy of the fragments. So that energy is 3 GeV (since 300 - 297 = 3 GeV). This energy is converted into kinetic energy of the two fragments. \n\nSince the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. Therefore, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. So, p1 = -p2. \n\nTherefore, the magnitudes of their momenta are equal. Let me denote the momentum of m1 as p, then m2 must have -p. \n\nThe kinetic energy of each fragment can be calculated using relativistic or classical formulas. The question is, what's the difference between the actual (relativistic) T1 and the classical T1. \n\nFirst, let's compute the classical case. \n\nIn the classical case, kinetic energy is (p\u00b2)/(2m). Since their momenta have the same magnitude, but masses are different. \n\nLet me denote m1 = 2m2, so let me write m2 = m, so m1 = 2m. \n\nSince momentum is the same in magnitude, p = sqrt(2 m T) for each.",

Since their masses are different, their speeds must be different. Let me denote the masses as m1 = 2m and m2 = m. The initial momentum is zero, so m1*v1 + m2*v2 = 0.

          "text1": "Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that in the relativistic case, the total energy is conserved, so the rest masses and kinetic energies must add up to the original mass energy. Let me think.\n\nThe initial rest mass energy is M c\u00b2. After fission, the total energy is (m1 c\u00b2 + T1) + (m2 c\u00b2 + T2). The total energy must equal the initial energy (since energy is conserved). So:\n\nM c\u00b2 = (m1 c\u00b2 + T1) + (m2 c\u00b2 + T2)\n\nWe know m1 + m2 = 0.99 M, so the rest mass terms add to 0.99 M c\u00b2. Thus,\n\nT1 + T2 = M c\u00b2 - 0.99 M c\u00b2 = 0.01 M c\u00b2, which matches what I had before.\n\nTherefore, the total kinetic energy is indeed 0.01 M c\u00b2. The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment in the relativistic vs classical calculation.\n\nIn the classical case, as I found, T1 is 1/3 of that total, so (1/3)*0.01 M c\u00b2.\n\nIn the relativistic case, we have to consider that momentum conservation still requires the magnitudes of their momenta to be equal. Let me write equations for the relativistic case.\n\nThe momentum of each fragment is p and -p. For the more massive fragment (mass m1 = 2m2), its momentum is p = gamma1 * m1 v1, and the other fragment's momentum is p = gamma2 * m2 v2. But since they are in opposite directions, their magnitudes are equal:\n\ngamma1 * m1 v1 = gamma2 * m2 v2.\n\nAdditionally, their velocities are in opposite directions, so the direction is accounted for in the sign, but the magnitudes must satisfy the above equation.\n\nAlso, from the conservation of energy, T1 + T2 = 0.01 M c\u00b2.\n\nBut since m1 = 2 m2, let me substitute variables.\n\nLet me denote m2 = m, so m1 = 2m. Then, the momentum equation becomes:\n\ngamma1 * 2m v1 = gamma2 * m v2 \u2192 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.\n\nAlso, the velocities v1 and v2 must be in opposite directions, but their magnitudes' relation comes from the momentum equation.\n\nAdditionally, the kinetic energies are T1 = (gamma1 -1) 2m c\u00b2, T2 = (gamma2 -1) m c\u00b2.\n\nSo T1 + T2 = (gamma1 -1) 2m c\u00b2 + (gamma2 -1) m c\u00b2 = 2m (gamma1 -1)c\u00b2 + m (gamma2 -1)c\u00b2 = m c\u00b2 [ 2(gamma1 -1) + (gamma2 -1) ]\n\nThis should equal 0.01 M c\u00b2. Since M = 3m / 0.99, so substituting M = (3m)/(0.99). Therefore, 0.01 M c\u00b2 = 0.01*(3m /0.99) c\u00b2 = (0.03 m /0.99) c\u00b2 = (0.0303...) m c\u00b2.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit messy.

So the total kinetic energy of both fragments is 3 GeV.\n\nNow, the problem is about the kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment. We need to compute T1 in two ways: relativistic and classical, then find the difference between them.\n\nFirst, let's handle the classical case. In classical physics, momentum conservation applies. Since the initial momentum is zero, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. So p1 = -p2. The masses are m1 and m2. Let me denote m1 = 2m2. Let me call m2 = m, so m1 =2m. Then, the total momentum is zero: m1 v1 + m2 v2 =0 \u2192 2m v1 + m v2 =0 \u2192 2v1 + v2 =0. So v2 = -2v1. The velocities are opposite.\n\nThe kinetic energy of each fragment is (1/2)m v\u00b2. So total kinetic energy is (1/2)(2m)v1\u00b2 + (1/2)(m)v2\u00b2. Since v2 = -2v1, v2\u00b2 =4v1\u00b2.

Therefore, solving for T1 (the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, which is m1 =2m):\n\nT1 (classical) = (1/2)(2m)v1\u00b2 = m v1\u00b2. Since total KE is 3m v1\u00b2 =3 GeV, so m v1\u00b2 = 1 GeV.",

For the more massive fragment (mass m1 = 2m2), its momentum is p = gamma1 * m1 v1, and the other fragment's momentum is p = gamma2 * m2 v2. But since they are in opposite directions, their magnitudes are equal:\n\ngamma1 * m1 v1 = gamma2 * m2 v2.\n\nAdditionally, their velocities are in opposite directions, so the direction is accounted for in the sign, but the magnitudes must satisfy the above equation.\n\nAlso, from the conservation of energy, T1 + T2 = 0.01 M c\u00b2.\n\nBut since m1 = 2 m2, let me substitute variables.\n\nLet me denote m2 = m, so m1 = 2m.

So masses are in GeV/c\u00b2, but since I'm setting c=1, mass and energy are in same units.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nInitial mass M = 300 GeV (since M c\u00b2 is 300 GeV, so M is 300 GeV/c\u00b2, but with c=1, M is 300 GeV).\n\nAfter fission:\n\nm1 = 2m, m2 = m. The sum m1 + m2 = 0.99 M \u2192 3m = 0.99 M \u2192 m = (0.99/3) M = 0.33 M. Therefore, m1 = 2*(0.33 M) = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M.\n\nSo m1 is 0.66 * 300 GeV /c\u00b2, but again, with c=1, m1 = 0.66 * 300 GeV, etc.\n\nThe total energy of the fragments must be M (since initial energy was M c\u00b2, which is M with c=1). The total energy is:\n\nE1 + E2 = M\n\nWhere E1 is the total energy of the first fragment (more massive), E2 of the second.\n\nAlso, momentum conservation: since initial momentum is zero, the momentum vectors must cancel. Let\u2019s set up coordinates so that the first fragment moves in the positive x-direction with momentum p, then the second must have momentum -p. So:\n\nE1 = sqrt( (m1)^2 + p^2 )\n\nE2 = sqrt( (m2)^2 + p^2 )\n\nBecause in relativity, E = sqrt( (mc\u00b2)^2 + (pc)^2 ), but with c=1, that's sqrt(m\u00b2 + p\u00b2) when E is in units where c=1 and m is in energy units.",
