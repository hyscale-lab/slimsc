So in regions where IKAROS is part of a complex (like active promoters), the antibody can't reach it because it's crosslinked to other proteins, so the peaks disappear. But then the real sites would be the ones that are losing peaks, which can't be right. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me think of another approach. The question is from a past exam perhaps, and I recall that when comparing PFA vs PFA+DSG, the use of DSG improves the capture of transcription factor binding sites because it crosslinks proteins to proteins, which helps in preserving the chromatin structure. However, sometimes PFA alone might give artifacts. For example, in regions with high GC content or repeats, which are difficult to map, the PFA might produce peaks due to non-specific crosslinking. When DSG is added, the fixation is better, so those false peaks in repeats (A) disappear because the alignment is more accurate, or the crosslinking is better.",
          "text2": "Alternatively, perhaps when using PFA alone, certain regions are more accessible, so the antibody can bind. But when adding another fixative (like DSG), maybe those regions become less accessible, so the peaks disappear. \n\nThe question is where those peaks are. Let's look at the options. The options are repeats, introns of large genes, random, or active promoters/enhancers.\n\nActive promoters and enhancers are regions where transcription factors like IKAROS would bind. If the fixation method with PFA+DSG somehow makes those regions less accessible, then the peaks (indicating IKAROS binding) would not show up.",

So, maybe the IKAROS factor is part of a larger complex that's more stable with DSG, so the antibody can't access the epitope anymore because the protein is now crosslinked into a larger complex, making it inaccessible.
