So first, when we measure P, we need to find the probability that the eigenvalue 0 is obtained, and then, given that, what's the probability of getting -1 for Q next. But actually, the question is the combined probability of first measuring 0 for P and then -1 for Q. So the process is: first measure P, get 0, then measure Q, get -1. The total probability is the product of the probability of getting 0 in P times the probability of getting -1 in Q given that the state is now in the eigenstate corresponding to 0 for P. \n\nSo first step: Find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P's operator matrix. Let's see. The matrix for P is symmetric, so it's Hermitian, which is good because observables must be Hermitian. Let me find its eigenvalues. \n\nThe matrix P is:\n\n[ 0        1/\u221a2      0      ]\n\n[1/\u221a2     0        1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[0        1/\u221a2      0      ]\n\nHmm, to find eigenvalues, we need to solve det(P - \u03bbI) =0. \n\nLet me write the determinant equation.

Let me compute that. \n\nThe determinant is:\n\n| -\u03bb    1/\u221a2     0    |\n\n|1/\u221a2  -\u03bb      1/\u221a2  |\n\n| 0    1/\u221a2    -\u03bb    |\n\nHmm, expanding the determinant:\n\nExpanding along the first row:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2)*[ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] + 0*...",
          "text2": "Wait, no, actually the question says: \"the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements\". So that's the joint probability of first measuring P and getting 0, then measuring Q and getting -1. \n\nSo the process is: start with the initial state, measure P, which collapses the state to an eigenstate of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then measure Q on that collapsed state, and find the probability of getting -1. Then multiply the probabilities of each step.\n\nFirst step: compute the probability that the first measurement of P yields 0, and then given that, compute the probability that Q gives -1. The total probability is the product of these two.\n\nSo first, find the eigenvalue 0 of operator P and the corresponding eigenvectors, then project the initial state onto that eigenspace. The probability of getting 0 is the squared norm of the projection of the initial state onto that eigenspace. Then, the state after measurement is the normalized projection. Then, from that state, compute the probability of measuring Q as -1, which would be the squared norm of the projection onto the eigenspace of Q with eigenvalue -1. Multiply those two probabilities.\n\nOkay, so let me start with operator P. Let's find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\n\nFirst, matrix P:\n\nRow 1: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\n\nRow 3: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nP = \n[ 0      1/\u221a2      0     ]\n[1/\u221a2    0      1/\u221a2    ]\n[ 0      1/\u221a2      0     ]\n\nHmm, so it's a symmetric matrix, so eigenvalues are real and eigenvectors can be orthogonal.\n\nWe need to find the eigenvalues. Let me see if 0 is an eigenvalue. Let me check the trace. The trace of P is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So sum of eigenvalues is zero.

Then the vector would be [a; \u221a2 a; a]. So, for example, choosing a=1, we get [1; \u221a2; 1]. But we can normalize it later.
