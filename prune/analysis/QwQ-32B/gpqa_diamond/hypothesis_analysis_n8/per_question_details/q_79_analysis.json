Suppose the product is a benzene ring with a 4-methyl group, a ketone, and another methyl from the ring opening. The two methyls would be the 4-methyl and another from the ring's carbon. The NMR would have two methyl singlets, which matches the product's data. The aromatic peaks would include the benzene ring's protons, split by the substituents.\n\nOption D: 2-styrylepoxide.

The correct compound X must be one that, when the epoxide ring undergoes rearrangement, forms a ketone and retains two methyl groups.\n\nOption C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane.

The styryl's benzene could have another substituent, but the question says the product has two methyls. So if the styryl's benzene isn't substituted, that might not give a second methyl.

No explicit methyl groups in the name, so maybe only one methyl from somewhere else?
