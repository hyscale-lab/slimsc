          "text1": "Wait, the problem says \"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" So maybe for each element in X, if there are multiple instances (i.e., multiple atoms of the same element?), then sum the masses of all isotopes present. But perhaps the question is just to take the atomic mass of the lightest element and the heaviest element, then add them. The isotopes part might be just saying that if there are multiple isotopes present, we have to consider their masses. But perhaps the question is simpler: the elements in X's formula, so the lightest and heaviest elements by atomic mass, and sum their atomic masses. The isotopes part might be a hint that one of them is a heavy isotope, but maybe the question wants us to consider the actual isotope used. For example, if the element is magnesium, but the isotope is Mg-25 (if it's a heavier isotope?), but the standard atomic mass is 24.3, but if it's using a specific isotope, like Mg-25, then the mass would be 25. Hmm, not sure.",
