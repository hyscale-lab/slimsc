          "text1": "Wait, let me think again. When the spots are on the visible side, the flux is F_visible = F_hemisphere * [ (1 - f) + f*(T_spot/T)^4 ]\n\nThe maximum flux is when the spots are on the far side, so F_max = F_hemisphere. The minimum is F_min = F_visible. \n\nThus, the amplitude (\u0394F) is (F_max - F_min)/F_max = ( F_h - F_visible ) / F_h \n\n= 1 - [ (1 - f) + f*(T_spot/T)^4 ] \n\n= f [ 1 - (T_spot/T)^4 ]\n\nSo the fractional amplitude is f * [1 - (T_spot/T)^4 ]\n\nPlugging in the numbers: \n\nf =0.2, T_spot=5000K, T=6000K. \n\nSo (T_spot/T)^4 = (5/6)^4 \u2248 0.482253 \n\nSo 1 - 0.482253 \u2248 0.517747 \n\nMultiply by f=0.2: 0.2 * 0.517747 \u2248 0.10355 \n\nSo the amplitude is ~10.355% of the flux. \n\nTherefore, the amplitude of the variation caused by the spots is ~10.36%. \n\nNow, the question states that this situation is similar to an exoplanet causing the same amplitude. What's the amplitude caused by a transiting planet?\n\nThe amplitude of the transit is given by (R_pl / R_star)^2. Because when the planet passes in front of the star, it blocks a fraction of the star's disk equal to the ratio of areas. The area blocked is \u03c0 R_pl\u00b2 / \u03c0 R_star\u00b2 = (R_pl/R_star)^2.",
          "text2": "Wait, the numerator is (L_max - L_min)/L_max. Because L_max is when the non-spotted is visible (so brightness is T_eff^4), and L_min is when the spotted is visible. \n\nSo the amplitude of the variation is (L_max - L_min)/L_max = 1 - [0.2*(5000/6000)^4 + 0.8*(1)^4]\n\nLet me compute that. Let me compute (5000/6000) = 5/6 \u2248 0.8333. \n\n(5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) \u2248 0.482253. \n\nSo 0.2 * 0.482253 = ~0.09645, and 0.8*1 = 0.8. Sum is ~0.89645. \n\nSo 1 - 0.89645 = 0.10355. So the amplitude of the light curve variation due to the spots is ~10.355% dip from max to min. \n\nNow, for a planet transit, the dip in brightness is (R_pl / R_star)^2. Because when the planet is in front, it blocks a circular area of radius R_pl, so the area blocked is \u03c0 R_pl^2, divided by the star's area \u03c0 R_star^2. So the fractional flux drop is (R_pl/R_star)^2. \n\nWe need this (R_pl/R_star)^2 to equal the amplitude of the spot variation, which is ~0.10355. \n\nSo solving for R_pl/R_star = sqrt(0.10355) \u2248 sqrt(0.10355). Let's compute that. \n\nsqrt(0.1) is ~0.316, sqrt(0.12) is ~0.346. So 0.1035 is close to 0.1, so sqrt(0.10355) \u2248 0.3218. \n\nLooking at the options: option D is ~0.32, which would be the closest.",

          "text2": "Wait, the total area of the star we see is a hemisphere. The spots take up 20% of that hemisphere's area. So the fraction of the visible disk covered by spots is 0.2. So the area ratio of spots in the visible is 0.2. But their temperature is lower. So the luminosity contributed by the spots is 0.2 (fraction of area) * (5000/6000)^4 of the non-spot's contribution. So maybe another way to compute the total luminosity when spots are facing us:\n\nTotal luminosity L_min = (1 - f) * L_spotless + f * L_spot,\n\nwhere f is the fractional area covered by spots (0.2), L_spotless is the luminosity per unit area at 6000K, and L_spot is (5000/6000)^4 times L_spotless.\n\nTherefore, L_min = L_spotless * [ (1 - f) + f*( (T_spot / T)^4 ) ]\n\nTherefore, the ratio L_min / L_max (where L_max is when there are no spots in view, so L_max = L_spotless * 1 (since the entire visible area is at T=6000K) would be:\n\n[L_min / L_max] = (1 - f) + f*( (T_spot / T)^4 )\n\nPlugging in the numbers: f = 0.2, T_spot = 5000, T = 6000.\n\nSo (T_spot / T) = 5/6, so (5/6)^4 \u2248 0.4807.\n\nThus:\n\n(1 - 0.2) + 0.2*(0.4807) = 0.8 + 0.09614 \u2248 0.89614.

When the spots are on the visible side, the flux is F_visible = F_hemisphere * [ (1 - f) + f*(T_spot/T)^4 ]\n\nThe maximum flux is when the spots are on the far side, so F_max = F_hemisphere. The minimum is F_min = F_visible. \n\nThus, the amplitude (\u0394F) is (F_max - F_min)/F_max = ( F_h - F_visible ) / F_h \n\n= 1 - [ (1 - f) + f*(T_spot/T)^4 ] \n\n= f [ 1 - (T_spot/T)^4 ]\n\nSo the fractional amplitude is f * [1 - (T_spot/T)^4 ]\n\nPlugging in the numbers: \n\nf =0.2, T_spot=5000K, T=6000K. \n\nSo (T_spot/T)^4 = (5/6)^4 \u2248 0.482253 \n\nSo 1 - 0.482253 \u2248 0.517747 \n\nMultiply by f=0.2: 0.2 * 0.517747 \u2248 0.10355 \n\nSo the amplitude is ~10.355% of the flux. \n\nTherefore, the amplitude of the variation caused by the spots is ~10.36%. \n\nNow, the question states that this situation is similar to an exoplanet causing the same amplitude. What's the amplitude caused by a transiting planet?\n\nThe amplitude of the transit is given by (R_pl / R_star)^2. Because when the planet passes in front of the star, it blocks a fraction of the star's disk equal to the ratio of areas. The area blocked is \u03c0 R_pl\u00b2 / \u03c0 R_star\u00b2 = (R_pl/R_star)^2.",
          "text2": "Wait, the numerator is (L_max - L_min)/L_max. Because L_max is when the non-spotted is visible (so brightness is T_eff^4), and L_min is when the spotted is visible. \n\nSo the amplitude of the variation is (L_max - L_min)/L_max = 1 - [0.2*(5000/6000)^4 + 0.8*(1)^4]\n\nLet me compute that. Let me compute (5000/6000) = 5/6 \u2248 0.8333. \n\n(5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) \u2248 0.482253. \n\nSo 0.2 * 0.482253 = ~0.09645, and 0.8*1 = 0.8. Sum is ~0.89645. \n\nSo 1 - 0.89645 = 0.10355. So the amplitude of the light curve variation due to the spots is ~10.355% dip from max to min. \n\nNow, for a planet transit, the dip in brightness is (R_pl / R_star)^2. Because when the planet is in front, it blocks a circular area of radius R_pl, so the area blocked is \u03c0 R_pl^2, divided by the star's area \u03c0 R_star^2. So the fractional flux drop is (R_pl/R_star)^2. \n\nWe need this (R_pl/R_star)^2 to equal the amplitude of the spot variation, which is ~0.10355. \n\nSo solving for R_pl/R_star = sqrt(0.10355) \u2248 sqrt(0.10355). Let's compute that. \n\nsqrt(0.1) is ~0.316, sqrt(0.12) is ~0.346. So 0.1035 is close to 0.1, so sqrt(0.10355) \u2248 0.3218. \n\nLooking at the options: option D is ~0.32, which would be the closest.",

So if the filling factor is 20% on one hemisphere, then when that hemisphere is facing us, 20% of the visible area (the hemisphere facing us) is spots.

So the maximum difference in brightness occurs when the spots are on the side facing us versus when they are on the opposite side (so not visible). \n\nThe effective temperature of the spots is 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K. The luminosity of a spot compared to the normal star's surface is proportional to (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4). Since the spots are cooler, their contribution to the total luminosity when visible is less. \n\nThe total luminosity when the spots are on the visible hemisphere would be: (Area without spots) * L_per_area + (Area of spots) * L_spot_per_area.
