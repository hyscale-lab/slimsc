          "text1": "Alternatively, maybe they are giving all masses except the neutrino's? Let me check the question again. The question does mention the rest mass of Pi and muon, but not the neutrino. So probably, the neutrino is considered massless here. That's a common assumption in such decay problems. \n\nSo, proceeding with that assumption. \n\nThe total energy conservation gives:\nE_\u03c0 = E_\u03bc + E_\u03bd\nWhere E_\u03c0 is the rest energy of the pion, m_\u03c0 c\u00b2 = 139.6 MeV.\n\nSo, 139.6 = E_\u03bc + E_\u03bd.\n\nAlso, since the neutrino's energy is E_\u03bd = p c, and the muon's energy is E_\u03bc = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_\u03bc c\u00b2)^2 )\n\nBut also, since their magnitudes of momentum are equal, so p_\u03bc = p_\u03bd = p. \n\nWe can set up equations here. Let me write variables in terms of MeV and c\u00b2 terms. Let's use units where c=1 for simplicity, so energies and masses are in MeV, and momentum squared would be (E^2 - m^2) ?",
          "text2": "Alternatively, maybe it's easier to write the conservation equations using energy and momentum.\n\nLet me set up the equations properly. Let me use natural units where c=1 for simplicity (so energies are in MeV, masses in MeV/c\u00b2, but since c is 1, the units just become MeV).\n\nSo the rest energy of the pion is 139.6 MeV.\n\nThe total energy after decay must equal that. The muon has energy E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + (m_mu)^2 ), and the neutrino has E_nu = sqrt( p^2 + 0 ) = p. Since their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite, their magnitudes are the same, so p_mu = p_nu = p. \n\nTherefore, the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6.\n\nNow, I need to solve for p. Once I have p, I can compute the kinetic energies.\n\nLet me write the equation again:\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6\n\nLet me denote x = p. Then,\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2) + x = 139.6\n\nLet me rearrange this equation.

          "text2": "Wait, the total energy of the muon is its kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy. So E_mu = K_mu + m_mu. Because in units where c=1, mass is energy. So E_mu = K_mu + m_mu. Similarly, the neutrino's energy is K_nu, since its rest mass is 0. So total energy:\n\n139.6 = (K_mu + 105.7) + K_nu. That's equation one.\n\nSecond equation is momentum conservation. Since the magnitudes are equal, the momentum of the muon and neutrino are equal. The momentum of each is p. The momentum of the muon can be written as sqrt( E_mu\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2 ). Since E_mu\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2, so p = sqrt( E_mu\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2 ). Similarly, for the neutrino, E_nu\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + 0, so p = E_nu. \n\nSince the magnitudes are equal, then sqrt( E_mu\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2 ) = E_nu. \n\nSo substituting E_mu as (K_mu + m_mu), so E_mu = K_mu + m_mu. \n\nSo let me write that equation again. \n\nsqrt( (K_mu + m_mu)^2 - m_mu\u00b2 ) = E_nu = K_nu (since neutrino's energy is K_nu)\n\nBut also from the first equation, K_nu = 139.6 - (K_mu + 105.7) = 139.6 - K_mu -105.7 = 33.9 - K_mu.\n\nSo substituting that into the momentum equation:\n\nsqrt( (K_mu + 105.7)^2 - (105.7)^2 ) = 33.9 - K_mu.\n\nHmm, that looks like an equation we can solve for K_mu. Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root. \n\nLeft side squared: ( (K_mu + 105.7)^2 - (105.7)^2 ) = (K_mu^2 + 2*105.7 K_mu + 105.7\u00b2) - 105.7\u00b2 ) = K_mu^2 + 211.4 K_mu.\n\nRight side squared: (33.9 - K_mu)^2 = 33.9\u00b2 - 2*33.9 K_mu + K_mu\u00b2.\n\nSet them equal:\n\nK_mu\u00b2 + 211.4 K_mu = (33.9)^2 - 2*(33.9) K_mu + K_mu\u00b2.\n\nSubtract K_mu\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n211.4 K_mu = 33.9\u00b2 - 67.8 K_mu.\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n211.4 K_mu + 67.8 K_mu = 33.9\u00b2.\n\nSo total K_mu*(211.4 +67.8) = 33.9^2.\n\nAdding the coefficients: 211.4 +67.8 = 279.2.\n\nThus, K_mu = (33.9)^2 / 279.2.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, 33.9 squared: 33.9 *33.9.

Taking the square root of that gives the energy of the muon.\n\nWhat's the square root of 12059.34?\n\nWell, sqrt(12059) is approximately. Let's see, 110\u00b2 is 12100. So sqrt(12059) is a bit less than 110. Let's see 110 squared is 12100. So 12100 -12059.34 =40.66. So the difference is about 40.66. So sqrt(12100 -40.66) \u2248 110 - (40.66)/(2\u00d7110) ) using the linear approximation.\n\nApprox sqrt(x - \u0394) \u2248 sqrt(x) - \u0394/(2 sqrt(x))\n\nSo sqrt(12100 -40.66) \u2248 110 - 40.66/(2*110) = 110 - 40.66/220 \u2248110 - 0.185 \u2248109.815 MeV.\n\nTherefore, E_mu \u2248109.8 MeV.",

The question does mention the rest mass of Pi and muon, but not the neutrino. So probably, the neutrino is considered massless here. That's a common assumption in such decay problems. \n\nSo, proceeding with that assumption. \n\nThe total energy conservation gives:\nE_\u03c0 = E_\u03bc + E_\u03bd\nWhere E_\u03c0 is the rest energy of the pion, m_\u03c0 c\u00b2 = 139.6 MeV.\n\nSo, 139.6 = E_\u03bc + E_\u03bd.\n\nAlso, since the neutrino's energy is E_\u03bd = p c, and the muon's energy is E_\u03bc = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_\u03bc c\u00b2)^2 )\n\nBut also, since their magnitudes of momentum are equal, so p_\u03bc = p_\u03bd = p. \n\nWe can set up equations here.

The muon has energy E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + (m_mu)^2 ), and the neutrino has E_nu = sqrt( p^2 + 0 ) = p.

Hmm sqrt(12000) is ~109.54, sqrt(12059.33) is a bit more. Let me see, 109.5^2 = 12000 (approx?), 109.5^2 = (110 -0.5)^2 = 12100 -110 +0.25 = 11990.25. So 109.5^2 =11990.25. The target is 12059.33, which is 69 more. Each 0.1 increase in the root adds approx 2*109.5*0.1 +0.01 = ~21.91. So 69 /21.91 \u2248 ~3.15 increments of 0.1. So 109.5 +0.315 \u2248 109.815.

So perhaps that's the muon's KE.\n\nThe neutrino's energy is p, which is 29.78 MeV (since E_nu = p c, and with c=1, E_nu=p). \n\nTotal energy is E_mu + E_nu = 109.8 +29.78 \u2248139.58 MeV, which is close to the pion's rest energy (139.6), so that checks out.\n\nNow, the neutrino's kinetic energy is all its energy because its rest mass is zero, so K_nu =29.78 MeV.",

Taking the square root of that gives the energy of the muon.\n\nWhat's the square root of 12059.34?\n\nWell, sqrt(12059) is approximately. Let's see, 110\u00b2 is 12100. So sqrt(12059) is a bit less than 110. Let's see 110 squared is 12100. So 12100 -12059.34 =40.66. So the difference is about 40.66.
