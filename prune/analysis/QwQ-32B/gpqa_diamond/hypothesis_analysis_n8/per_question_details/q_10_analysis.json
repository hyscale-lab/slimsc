Let me see: suppose composition same. Let me think of Earth.

The relationship between mass and radius for rocky planets can be approximated by a formula where radius scales as mass^(1/3), assuming constant density. But if the density increases with mass due to compression, then the radius would increase less than that. \n\nSuppose that for a planet with composition same as Earth (so same material densities), but higher mass, the radius increases sub-linearly. For example, if doubling the mass leads to radius increasing by sqrt(mass) or something, but this is too vague.",

If the composition is the same, the material's properties (like compressibility) are the same. So for planets with the same composition, their radius and mass should follow certain scaling laws. For instance, if a planet is more massive, it might have a larger radius, but not as large as the mass increase. Let me think about how exactly that works. \n\nThere's a concept called the \"polytropic model\" for planets, but maybe I can simplify. Let's suppose that for a planet with the same composition, the radius scales with the mass raised to some power. For example, if it's an ideal gas, maybe different, but for rocky planets, maybe the radius scales roughly with the cube root of the mass?",
