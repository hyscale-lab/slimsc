Maybe the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, so the distance from P to the conductor's center is L. The vector from the conductor's center to the cavity's center is s, so the distance between the two centers is s. So the distance between P and the cavity's center l is related to L and s via the law of cosines? Like, l\u00b2 = L\u00b2 + s\u00b2 - 2 L s cos(theta), where theta is the angle between them.",

Because even if the cavity is displaced, the outer surface's charge redistributes such that the field outside is as if the charge were at the center. Hmm, that might be the case. \n\nIf that's true, then the electric field at point P would just be (1/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080))*(q)/(L\u00b2), since L is the distance from the conductor's center.
