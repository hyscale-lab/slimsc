          "text1": "Wait, let's think about the area. To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2, assuming that the radius here is the parameter up to which we integrate. Let me proceed.\n\nThe area element in polar coordinates is sqrt(g) dr d\u03b8. The metric in polar coordinates is given by:\n\ng_{rr} = 32/(4 - r\u00b2), g_{\u03b8\u03b8} = 32 r\u00b2/(4 - r\u00b2). The determinant of the metric is g_{rr} * g_{\u03b8\u03b8} because it's diagonal, so:\n\ndet(g) = [32/(4 - r\u00b2)] * [32 r\u00b2/(4 - r\u00b2)] = (32)^2 r\u00b2/(4 - r\u00b2)^2.\n\nTherefore sqrt(det(g)) = 32 r/(4 - r\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, the area element dA = (32 r)/(4 - r\u00b2) dr d\u03b8.\n\nTo compute the area up to radius R (which is 2 in this case), we integrate from r=0 to r=R, and \u03b8 from 0 to 2\u03c0:\n\nA = \u222b\u2080^{2\u03c0} \u222b\u2080^R [32 r/(4 - r\u00b2)] dr d\u03b8 \n\nFirst, the angular integral gives 2\u03c0, so:\n\nA = 2\u03c0 * 32 \u222b\u2080^R [ r/(4 - r\u00b2) ] dr\n\nLet me compute the integral \u222b [ r/(4 - r\u00b2) ] dr. Let me make substitution u = 4 - r\u00b2, then du = -2r dr, so - (1/2) du = r dr. \n\nThus, the integral becomes:\n\n\u222b [ r/(u) ] dr = \u222b (1/u) * ( -1/2 du ) = - (1/2) \u222b (1/u) du = - (1/2) ln|u| + C.\n\nSo evaluating from 0 to R:\n\nAt upper limit R: - (1/2) ln(4 - R\u00b2)\n\nAt lower limit 0: - (1/2) ln(4 - 0) = - (1/2) ln(4)\n\nThus, the integral from 0 to R is [ - (1/2) ln(4 - R\u00b2) - ( - (1/2) ln4 ) ] = (1/2)[ ln4 - ln(4 - R\u00b2) ] = (1/2) ln(4/(4 - R\u00b2))\n\nTherefore, plugging back into Area:\n\nA = 2\u03c0 *32 * [ (1/2) ln(4/(4 - R\u00b2)) ] = 32 \u03c0 * ln(4/(4 - R\u00b2))\n\nNow, if R =2, then 4 - R\u00b2 = 4 - 4 =0. So the logarithm becomes ln(4/0), which is ln(infinity) which is infinity. Therefore, the area diverges to infinity as R approaches 2. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2 is infinite. \n\nLooking at the options, D is +\\infty. So the answer would be D.",

Because in standard terms, the area of a disk of radius 2 would be \u03c0*(2)^2=4\u03c0, but here, with the metric, it's scaled by that factor.\n\nSo the area A would be the integral over x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 <4 of [32/(4 -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)] dx dy. Let me set up the integral in polar coordinates since the region is a circle. Let x = r cos\u03b8, y = r sin\u03b8, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = r\u00b2. The integral becomes:\n\nA = \u222b\u2080^{2\u03c0} \u222b\u2080^2 [32/(4 - r\u00b2)] * r dr d\u03b8. \n\nThe 32/(4 - r\u00b2) comes from the area element, and the r dr d\u03b8 is the Jacobian determinant for polar coordinates. \n\nLet me compute this. The angular integral is straightforward: 2\u03c0. So:\n\nA = 32 * 2\u03c0 \u222b\u2080^2 [r/(4 - r\u00b2)] dr. \n\nHmm, so the integral simplifies to 64\u03c0 \u222b\u2080^2 [r/(4 - r\u00b2)] dr. Let me compute the integral of r/(4 - r\u00b2) dr. Let me substitute u =4 - r\u00b2, then du = -2r dr \u21d2 -du/2 = r dr. \n\nChanging the limits: when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes:\n\n\u222b_{u=4}^{0} (1/u) * (-du/2) ) = (1/2) \u222b\u2080^4 (1/u) du.",

Let me proceed.\n\nThe area element in polar coordinates is sqrt(g) dr d\u03b8. The metric in polar coordinates is given by:\n\ng_{rr} = 32/(4 - r\u00b2), g_{\u03b8\u03b8} = 32 r\u00b2/(4 - r\u00b2). The determinant of the metric is g_{rr} * g_{\u03b8\u03b8} because it's diagonal, so:\n\ndet(g) = [32/(4 - r\u00b2)] * [32 r\u00b2/(4 - r\u00b2)] = (32)^2 r\u00b2/(4 - r\u00b2)^2.\n\nTherefore sqrt(det(g)) = 32 r/(4 - r\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, the area element dA = (32 r)/(4 - r\u00b2) dr d\u03b8.\n\nTo compute the area up to radius R (which is 2 in this case), we integrate from r=0 to r=R, and \u03b8 from 0 to 2\u03c0:\n\nA = \u222b\u2080^{2\u03c0} \u222b\u2080^R [32 r/(4 - r\u00b2)] dr d\u03b8 \n\nFirst, the angular integral gives 2\u03c0, so:\n\nA = 2\u03c0 * 32 \u222b\u2080^R [ r/(4 - r\u00b2) ] dr\n\nLet me compute the integral \u222b [ r/(4 - r\u00b2) ] dr. Let me make substitution u = 4 - r\u00b2, then du = -2r dr, so - (1/2) du = r dr. \n\nThus, the integral becomes:\n\n\u222b [ r/(u) ] dr = \u222b (1/u) * ( -1/2 du ) = - (1/2) \u222b (1/u) du = - (1/2) ln|u| + C.\n\nSo evaluating from 0 to R:\n\nAt upper limit R: - (1/2) ln(4 - R\u00b2)\n\nAt lower limit 0: - (1/2) ln(4 - 0) = - (1/2) ln(4)\n\nThus, the integral from 0 to R is [ - (1/2) ln(4 - R\u00b2) - ( - (1/2) ln4 ) ] = (1/2)[ ln4 - ln(4 - R\u00b2) ] = (1/2) ln(4/(4 - R\u00b2))\n\nTherefore, plugging back into Area:\n\nA = 2\u03c0 *32 * [ (1/2) ln(4/(4 - R\u00b2)) ] = 32 \u03c0 * ln(4/(4 - R\u00b2))\n\nNow, if R =2, then 4 - R\u00b2 = 4 - 4 =0.
