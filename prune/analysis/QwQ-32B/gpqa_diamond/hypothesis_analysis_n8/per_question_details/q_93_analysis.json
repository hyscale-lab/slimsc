Because each tenfold dilution (which is a difference of 1 in log10) should correspond to a change in Ct of about 3.32 cycles. \n\nLooking at the given data, the slope is exactly -3.3, which is very close to -3.32. The R\u00b2 is 1, indicating a perfect linear fit. That suggests the data actually aligns perfectly with the expected slope for 100% efficiency. So the slope and R\u00b2 are good. \n\nNow the options: Let's look at each option. \n\nOption A says qPCR can't be used for quantification. But the question says the efficiency is 100% and the calibration curve is perfect. So A is incorrect because qPCR is indeed used for quantification when done properly, and here the setup seems correct. \n\nOption B states that Ct values don't agree with the nucleic acid amount. But according to the given data, the Ct values do decrease as concentration decreases, which is expected. The slope is correct, so the Ct values are in agreement.
