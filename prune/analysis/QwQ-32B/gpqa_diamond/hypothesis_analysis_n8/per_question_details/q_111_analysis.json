If the nitropropane's enolate attacks the enenitrile's \u03b2 carbon (C3), then the structure would be:\n\nOriginal nitropropane: NO2-CH2-CH2-CH3 (but wait, nitropropane is CH2NO2-CH2-CH3, so the enolate is on the CH2 between the nitro and the CH2-CH3). Attacking the enenitrile's C3 (which is adjacent to the double bond), the new carbon chain would be:\n\nC1 (nitro) - C2 (enolate, now connected to C3 of the enenitrile) - C3 (from nitropropane) - then the enenitrile's carbons: C4 (the original C3, now connected), then the original double bond between C2 and C3 (now part of the chain?), and the nitrile on the end.",

So the new bond is between C2 and the enolate's carbon. \n\nThus, the structure becomes: \n\nC1 (NO2) - C2 (connected to C3 (CH3) and the enolate's carbon) - ... \n\nThe enolate's carbon (originally C1 of the enenitrile) is now attached to C2 of the nitropropane. The rest of the enenitrile comes along, so the chain from the enolate's carbon is: \n\nC2 (of nitropropane) \u2192 C'1 (from enolate) \u2192 C'2 (originally enenitrile's C2, part of double bond) \u2192 C'3 (originally enenitrile's C3, CH2) \u2192 C'4 (nitrile). \n\nThe double bond in the enenitrile was between C'1 and C'2 (assuming the enenitrile's structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CN), so after the enolate attack, that double bond may be lost, making the chain longer. \n\nSo the full structure would be: \n\nC1 (NO2) - C2 (CH2 connected to C3 (CH3) and C'1).",
