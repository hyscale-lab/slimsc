Hmm, maybe Skyrmion isn't a Goldstone boson. But I need to check the others first.\n\nMagnon. Magnons are quasiparticles representing spin waves in a magnetic material. The symmetry here is the rotational symmetry of the spins. When a ferromagnet forms, the continuous rotational symmetry is broken down to the symmetry around the magnetization axis. The Goldstone bosons in this case are the magnons. So Magnon (C) is associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking. So C is out.\n\nPion. Pions are mesons, and in the context of particle physics, the pion is the Nambu-Goldstone boson resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The chiral symmetry is broken due to the quark condensate, leading to the pions as Goldstone bosons. So D is associated.",

Magnons are quasiparticles representing collective excitations of electron spins in a magnetic material. Magnetic materials have spontaneous magnetization, which breaks the rotational symmetry (like in ferromagnets). The magnons are the Goldstone bosons for this symmetry breaking. So yes, magnons are linked to spontaneous symmetry breaking.\n\nOption D is Pion. Pions are the pseudoscalar mesons. In particle physics, the pions are the Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) due to the quark condensate. So pions are definitely associated with a broken symmetry.\n\nNow, the question is which one is NOT associated.

Let me verify. \n\nSkyrmions are solutions in a theory where the symmetry is unbroken? Or perhaps they are topological defects rather than Goldstone bosons. Goldstone's theorem says that when a continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken, massless bosons (Goldstone bosons) appear. But Skyrmions are solitonic, meaning they're extended structures stabilized by energy considerations, not necessarily from a broken symmetry.",
