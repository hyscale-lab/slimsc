Let me try to imagine the cyclopentene ring. Let's assign the configuration of the starting compound. The enol has the -OH on C1. The double bond is between C1 and C2. \n\nIn a cyclopentene ring, the double bond is planar. The substituents on each carbon would be arranged around the ring. The -OH is on C1.

The other groups are the adjacent carbons (C5 and C2). Let's assign priorities. \n\nFor carbon 1: the substituents are Br, OH, and the two adjacent carbons (say, C5 and C2, which are part of the ring).
