So now, the two chiral centers have the same configuration. Let's see if this leads to a meso compound. In a meso compound, the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry. For example, in tartaric acid, when both hydroxyl groups are in the same configuration (RR or SS), it's a meso form. Similarly here, if the two methyl groups are placed such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let's see: the carbons 2 and 3 each have a methyl group. If the configurations are both R, then perhaps there's a plane of symmetry between them. Let me imagine the molecule. Let's say the two chiral centers have R configurations. The molecule would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. The central part is CH(CH3)-CH(CH3). If the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is symmetric, then it would be a meso compound and not optically active. For example, if each of the two methyl groups are on the same side (for R and R?), maybe the plane of symmetry is between the two central carbons. In that case, the compound would be meso, so optically inactive. So this one would not be optically active.

A cyclohexene ring with an alcohol on C1 and the double bond between C3 and C4 (since the en-3-ene means the double bond is between 3 and 4).

Let me see: the cyclohex-3-ene has the double bond between carbons 3 and 4. The OH is on C1. The structure would have a chiral carbon at C1, assuming the other groups around it are different. Let's see: C1 has OH, and the other groups. The rest of the ring would have substituents. Since it's a cyclohexene, the other substituents on C1 would be the two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6, perhaps). But in any case, as long as C1 has four different groups, it's chiral. The groups on C1 would be: OH, CH2 (maybe?), but let's think. The exact structure might not be crucial here. Since the configuration is given as R, that implies that there is a chiral center, so the compound is chiral and thus optically active.

          "text1": "Wait, but when considering the substituents on Carbon 1, the actual groups are the bonds to the adjacent carbons, but their substituents matter. If C2 has a different environment than C6, then Carbon 1's substituents would be different.\n\nFor example, the substituent via C2 would involve the double bond's influence, whereas C6 is part of an ordinary ring CH2. Therefore, the two substituents (C2 and C6) are different. \n\nTherefore, Carbon 1's substituents are:\n\n- OH,\n\n- H,\n\n- a group that includes the double bond (through C2),\n\n- and a regular CH2 group (through C6).\n\nThus, all four substituents are different, making Carbon 1 a chiral center. Therefore, the (R) configuration indicates it's a chiral center. Thus, this compound is optically active.\n\nSixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol.\n\nThis is a cyclohexane with hydroxyl groups on carbons 1, 3, and 5. The (1s,3s,5s) configurations indicate each of these OH groups is on the same side (all s or all r, but here they're all s). Let me think about the structure's symmetry. \n\nCyclohexane is a symmetric ring. If hydroxyl groups are on carbons 1, 3, and 5, spaced two apart, this might create a plane of symmetry. Let's see:\n\nIn a cyclohexane ring, positions 1, 3, and 5 are every other carbon. Adding OH groups on all three, and with their configurations (all s), perhaps the molecule is symmetric. \n\nSuppose the ring is viewed as a chair conformation. If the OH groups are all axial or all equatorial on the same side, then there might be symmetry.",

Therefore, the two ring carbons (2 and 6) attached to carbon 1 have different environments. Therefore, carbon 1 has four different groups: OH, H, carbon 2 (which is next to the double bond), and carbon 6 (which is not). So that makes four different groups, so carbon 1 is a chiral center. Hence, the (R) designation indicates its configuration. Therefore, this compound is chiral and optically active. So fifth compound counts.\n\nSixth compound: (1S,3S,5S)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol.
