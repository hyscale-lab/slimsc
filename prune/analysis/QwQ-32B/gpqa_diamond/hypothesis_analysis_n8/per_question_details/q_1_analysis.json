So the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in their energy. Since the first state has a larger uncertainty (because it's shorter lifetime), then the energy difference must be larger than that uncertainty.\n\nSo the minimum required energy difference to be resolved would be on the order of \u0394E1 (the largest uncertainty). Because if the energy difference is smaller than that, then the two states would overlap in their energy distributions, making them indistinct. \n\nIn this case, the first state's uncertainty is ~3.3e-7 eV. The options are: A) 1e-9 eV (smaller than that), B) 1e-11 (way smaller), C) 1e-4 (larger), D) 1e-8 (smaller than 3.3e-7 eV?",

          "text1": "Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me see if the formula is \u0394E \u0394t ~ \u0127. Sometimes it's written as \u0394E \u0394t \u2248 \u0127, so perhaps I should have used \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/\u0394t instead of divided by 2. Let's check that. \n\nIf the formula is \u0394E * \u0394t ~ \u0127, then:\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127 / \u0394t1 \u2192 (1.05e-34)/(1e-9) = 1.05e-25 J \u2192 in eV, that's (1.05e-25)/(1.6e-19) \u2248 6.56e-7 eV. \n\nThen \u0394E2 would be 1.05e-34/(1e-8) = 1.05e-26 J \u2192 6.56e-8 eV. \n\nSo the sum would be ~6.56e-7 +6.56e-8 \u2248 7.2e-7 eV. \n\nStill, the required energy difference must be more than that.

So \u0127 = (1.0545718e-34) / (1.602e-19) eV\u00b7s. Let me compute that. \n\nDivide numerator and denominator: 1.0545718 / 1.602 \u2248 ~0.658. Then 1e-34 / 1e-19 = 1e-15. So total is ~0.658e-15 eV\u00b7s \u2192 6.58e-16 eV\u00b7s.
