In 4D, each loop integral (in dimensional regularization?) typically gives a factor of 1/(4 pi)^2 multiplied by some function, like 1/epsilon or logs. But if the regularization is done with a cutoff M, then each loop integral might give a factor proportional to M^4 (if it's a linearly divergent integral?), but in the given expression, it's 1/(4 pi)^6. Let me think of a simple example: the one-loop diagram in a scalar theory. The loop integral over momentum k in 4D would have a denominator like k^2 - m^2, but if we regularize with a cutoff, the integral would be ~ cutoff^4. But in terms of the given expression, perhaps each loop contributes a 1/(4 pi)^2 term? So for L loops, that would be (1/(4 pi)^2)^L = 1/(4 pi)^{2L}.
