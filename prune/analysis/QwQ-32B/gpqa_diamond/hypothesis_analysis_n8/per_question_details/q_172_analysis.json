          "text2": "Wait, need to clarify. The question says \"twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". So let me parse that.\n\nSuppose the energy level in question is an excited state. Let's say the excited state is the upper level. Let me think: the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in that specific level compared to star_2. So the number of atoms in that excited level (let's call it level u) over the lower level (l) would be twice as much for star1 compared to star2. \n\nSo, the ratio (N_u/N_l)_1 = 2*(N_u/N_l)_2. \n\nUsing the Boltzmann equation, each ratio would be (g_u/g_l) * exp(-\u0394E/(k T)). Since the energy levels and the statistical weights (g_u and g_l) are the same for both stars (since they are the same element and transition), the (g_u/g_l) terms would cancel out when taking the ratio between the two stars. \n\nSo setting up the equation:\n\n(Nu/Nl)_1 / (Nu/Nl)_2 = 2 = [ exp( -\u0394E/(k T1) ) / exp( -\u0394E/(k T2) ) ]\n\nBecause the (g terms) cancel. \n\nSimplifying the exponential terms: \n\nexp( -\u0394E/(k T1) + \u0394E/(k T2) ) = 2 \n\nFactor out \u0394E/k:\n\nexp( \u0394E/(k) [ -1/(T1) + 1/(T2) ]) = 2",
