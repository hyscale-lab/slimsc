The period P is related to the separation a between the star and planet (since the planet's orbit is around the center of mass, but since M_p << M_*, the separation is approximately the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit around the star). \n\nLet me consider that the star moves in a circular orbit with radius r*, and the planet moves in a radius r_p, such that r* / r_p = M_p / M_* (since the center of mass is between them). The total separation a = r* + r_p \u2248 r_p (since M_p << M_*). Hence, r* \u2248 (M_p / (M_* + M_p )) * a \u2248 (M_p/M_*) a. \n\nThe star's orbital speed v* is (2\u03c0 r*) / P. \n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is this v*, since the maximum velocity shift would be the star's orbital speed (assuming we are observing along the plane, sin i =1). \n\nSo K = (2\u03c0 r*) / P. \n\nBut r* is (M_p/(M_* + M_p )) * a \u2248 (M_p/M_*) a. \n\nTherefore, K \u2248 (2\u03c0 (M_p/M_*) a ) / P \n\nBut from Kepler's third law, for the planet's orbit: \n\nP^2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2/G(M_* + M_p )) * a^3 \u2248 (4\u03c0\u00b2/G M_*) a^3 \n\nThus, solving for a^3 = (G M_* P\u00b2)/(4\u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nSo a = ( (G M_* P\u00b2)/(4\u03c0\u00b2) )^(1/3 )\n\nSubstituting back into K:\n\nK \u2248 (2\u03c0 (M_p/M_*) * ( (G M_* P\u00b2)/(4\u03c0\u00b2) )^(1/3) )) / P \n\nLet me simplify that expression:\n\nFirst, let's compute the terms:\n\nLet me write (G M_* P\u00b2/(4\u03c0\u00b2 ))^(1/3) = (G M_* )^(1/3) (P^2)^(1/3) / (4\u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/3 )\n\nSo,\n\nK \u2248 [ 2\u03c0 * (M_p / M_* ) * (G M_* )^(1/3) (P^(2/3)) / (4\u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/3) ) ] / P \n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nMultiply the terms:\n\nThe numerator terms:\n\n2\u03c0 * (M_p / M_* ) * (G M_* )^(1/3) * P^(2/3) / (4\u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/3 )\n\nDenominator is P.\n\nSo the entire expression becomes:\n\n[2\u03c0 * (M_p/M_*) * (G M_* )^(1/3) * P^(2/3) / (4\u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/3) ) ] / P \n\n= 2\u03c0 * (M_p / M_*) * (G M_* )^(1/3) * P^(2/3 -1) / (4\u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/3 ) \n\nBecause dividing by P is P^(-1), so exponent of P is (2/3 -1) = -1/3.\n\nSo:\n\n= 2\u03c0 * (M_p / M_*) * (G M_* )^(1/3) * P^(-1/3) / (4\u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/3 )\n\nLet me simplify constants:\n\nThe constants are 2\u03c0 divided by (4\u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3). Let's compute that:\n\n(4\u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3) = 4^(1/3) * (\u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3) = (2\u00b2)^(1/3) * \u03c0^(2/3) = 2^(2/3) \u03c0^(2/3)\n\nSo 2\u03c0 / (2^(2/3) \u03c0^(2/3)) ) \n\n= 2^(1 - 2/3) \u03c0^(1 - 2/3) \n\n= 2^(1/3) \u03c0^(1/3) \n\nThus the constants simplify to (2\u03c0)^(1/3) ?",
          "text2": "Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the relation between K and P. Let's see.\n\nLet me consider that the star's velocity v is related to the planet's mass and the distance. Let me use Kepler's third law and the velocity formula to find a relation between K and the orbital period P.\n\nStarting with Kepler's third law:\n\nP\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2/G(M_star + M_planet)) * a\u00b3.

Let's calculate that.\n\n5/7 is approximately 0.7142857. \n\nCubing that: 0.714^3 \u2248 0.714 * 0.714 = ~0.51, then 0.51 * 0.714 \u2248 ~0.364.\n\nSo approximately 0.364. Which is close to option A (0.36).",
          "text2": "Wait, the question is asking \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\" \n\nWhich is P2/P1. But according to the calculation, that's (v1/v2)^3 = (5/7)^3 \u2248 0.364, so P2/P1 \u2248 0.36, which would be option A.",
