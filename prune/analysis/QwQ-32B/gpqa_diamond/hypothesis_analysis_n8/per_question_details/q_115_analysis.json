So we need to find 2\u03b8. \n\nNow, let's model this. Let me set up coordinates. Let the x-axis be the horizontal, and y-axis vertical. Let the first photon (upper-right) have an angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, so its direction is (cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8). The second photon (lower-right) is angle \u03b8 below the x-axis, so its direction is (cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8). \n\nSo the momentum vectors for the photons are:\n\np1 = (E/c)(cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8)\n\np2 = (E/c)(cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8)\n\nAdding these together, the total momentum of the photons is:\n\np_total_photons = p1 + p2 = (E/c)(2 cos\u03b8, 0 )\n\nBecause the y-components cancel out. \n\nBut the total momentum must equal the initial momentum of the electron and positron system, which was in the x-direction. So that's consistent. \n\nThe x-component of the total photon momentum must equal the initial momentum's x-component. The initial momentum was p_total = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) in the x-direction. \n\nSo equate the x-components:\n\n(E/c)(2 cos\u03b8) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\n\nBut also, the total energy from the photons must equal the total initial energy. \n\nThe total energy from the photons is 2E (since each has E). The initial total energy was (\u03b3_e + \u03b3_p) m_e c\u00b2 = (4 + 2)m_e c\u00b2 =6 m_e c\u00b2. Therefore, 2E =6 m_e c\u00b2 \u2192 E =3 m_e c\u00b2. \n\nSo substituting E into the momentum equation:\n\n(3 m_e c\u00b2 / c ) * 2 cos\u03b8 = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n3 m_e c * 2 cos\u03b8 = 6 m_e c cos\u03b8 \n\nRight side is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\n\nCancel m_e c from both sides:\n\n6 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)\n\nTherefore, cos\u03b8 = [ sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ] /6 \n\nNow compute that value numerically. Let me compute sqrt(15) \u2248 3.87298, sqrt(3) \u22481.73205. \n\nSubtract: 3.87298 -1.73205 \u2248 2.14093. \n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093 /6 \u2248 0.35682. \n\nSo cos\u03b8 \u22480.3568. \n\nNow, to find \u03b8, take arccos(0.3568). Let me calculate that. \n\nUsing a calculator, arccos(0.3568) is approximately 69 degrees (since cos(60\u00b0)=0.5, cos(69\u00b0) is about 0.358, which is close. Let me check: cos(69) \u2248 cos(69\u00b0)= approx 0.358. So \u03b8 \u224869 degrees. \n\nTherefore, the angle between the two photons is 2\u03b8 \u2248138 degrees. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138. So that must be the answer.

          "text1": "Alternatively, if the angle between them is measured as the angle between their direction vectors, then since one is \u03b8 above and the other \u03b8 below, the total angle between them would be 2\u03b8. So we need to find 2\u03b8. \n\nNow, let's model this. Let me set up coordinates. Let the x-axis be the horizontal, and y-axis vertical. Let the first photon (upper-right) have an angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, so its direction is (cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8). The second photon (lower-right) is angle \u03b8 below the x-axis, so its direction is (cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8). \n\nSo the momentum vectors for the photons are:\n\np1 = (E/c)(cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8)\n\np2 = (E/c)(cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8)\n\nAdding these together, the total momentum of the photons is:\n\np_total_photons = p1 + p2 = (E/c)(2 cos\u03b8, 0 )\n\nBecause the y-components cancel out. \n\nBut the total momentum must equal the initial momentum of the electron and positron system, which was in the x-direction. So that's consistent. \n\nThe x-component of the total photon momentum must equal the initial momentum's x-component. The initial momentum was p_total = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) in the x-direction. \n\nSo equate the x-components:\n\n(E/c)(2 cos\u03b8) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\n\nBut also, the total energy from the photons must equal the total initial energy. \n\nThe total energy from the photons is 2E (since each has E). The initial total energy was (\u03b3_e + \u03b3_p) m_e c\u00b2 = (4 + 2)m_e c\u00b2 =6 m_e c\u00b2. Therefore, 2E =6 m_e c\u00b2 \u2192 E =3 m_e c\u00b2. \n\nSo substituting E into the momentum equation:\n\n(3 m_e c\u00b2 / c ) * 2 cos\u03b8 = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n3 m_e c * 2 cos\u03b8 = 6 m_e c cos\u03b8 \n\nRight side is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\n\nCancel m_e c from both sides:\n\n6 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)\n\nTherefore, cos\u03b8 = [ sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ] /6 \n\nNow compute that value numerically. Let me compute sqrt(15) \u2248 3.87298, sqrt(3) \u22481.73205. \n\nSubtract: 3.87298 -1.73205 \u2248 2.14093. \n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093 /6 \u2248 0.35682. \n\nSo cos\u03b8 \u22480.3568. \n\nNow, to find \u03b8, take arccos(0.3568). Let me calculate that. \n\nUsing a calculator, arccos(0.3568) is approximately 69 degrees (since cos(60\u00b0)=0.5, cos(69\u00b0) is about 0.358, which is close. Let me check: cos(69) \u2248 cos(69\u00b0)= approx 0.358. So \u03b8 \u224869 degrees. \n\nTherefore, the angle between the two photons is 2\u03b8 \u2248138 degrees. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138. So that must be the answer. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.",

The positron is moving in the negative x direction. So the initial momentum sum is p_e (electron's momentum) plus (-p_p) (positron's momentum). So total initial momentum is p_e - p_p in the x direction. \n\nSo the vector of the total initial momentum is along the x-axis with magnitude (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c. \n\nNow, the two photons' momenta (p1 and p2) must add up to this vector. Let me consider their directions. The problem states that one photon is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. So in other words, both are in the right half of the coordinate system (since upper-right and lower-right are to the right of the y-axis).
