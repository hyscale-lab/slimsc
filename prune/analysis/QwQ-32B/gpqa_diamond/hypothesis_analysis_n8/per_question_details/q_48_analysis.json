But lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a milder reagent compared to LAH, so maybe it doesn't reduce double bonds. Regular LAH reduces esters to alcohols and also reduces the C=C double bonds. But the tri-tert-butoxy version might not. Let me check my knowledge here. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (often abbreviated as LiAlH[OtBu]3) is less reactive than LAH. It's used for selective reductions. For example, it can reduce esters to alcohols without reducing double bonds, whereas LAH would go further. So in this case, since product 3 has a double bond in the ring (from the cyclohexene), the reduction with LiAlH[OtBu]3 would probably leave that double bond intact. So the reduction would only affect the acyl chloride group. \n\nSo the acyl chloride (RCOCl) becomes RCH2OH. So the carbonyl carbon (originally part of the ketone) is now a CH2OH group. So the structure would have the original cyclohexene ring (with the double bond between two carbons) and the carbonyl carbon now part of a -CH2OH group. \n\nPutting this all together:\n\nOriginal cyclohexanone (structure: cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group between, say, C1 and O). \n\nAfter bromination at the alpha carbon (C2), product 1 is 1-bromo-2-cyclohexanone (but more accurately, the bromine is on the alpha carbon adjacent to the carbonyl). \n\nHeating with NaOH (base) causes dehydrobromination, eliminating Br and a proton to form a double bond between C2 and C3 (assuming the bromine was on C2, and the proton is on C3), resulting in cyclohex-2-en-1-one (product 2).\n\nThen, treating with SOCl2 and pyridine converts the ketone carbonyl to an acyl chloride (product 3 is cyclohex-2-enoyl chloride).\n\nFinally, reducing the acyl chloride with LiAlH[OtBu]3 converts the carbonyl to a CH2OH group, resulting in cyclohex-2-en-1-ol (product 4).",
