The question is, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes, so from now (t=50) to t=200 minutes. \n\nThe memoryless property says that the probability of surviving an additional time t is equal to the probability of surviving t time units from the start. So the conditional probability that it survives beyond t_total given it has survived up to now is the same as the survival probability for t_total - t_initial. \n\nTherefore, the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200 is equal to 1 - survival probability for 150 minutes. \n\nSo first, let's compute the survival probability over 150 minutes, S(150) = e^(-\u03bb*150). Then the decay probability over 150 minutes is 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150). \n\nSo we need to compute this value using the \u03bb from the given data. \n\nWe have \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100. Let me compute e^(-\u03bb*150). \n\nSubstituting \u03bb into that exponent:\n\ne^(- [ -ln(0.68)/100 ] * 150 ) = e^( (ln(0.68)/100)*150 )\n\nThat simplifies to e^( (150/100) * ln(0.68) ) = e^( (3/2)*ln(0.68) ) \n\nWhich is equal to (e^{ln(0.68)})^(3/2) = (0.68)^(3/2). \n\nSo S(150) = 0.68^(3/2). \n\nTherefore, the decay probability over 150 minutes is 1 - 0.68^(3/2). \n\nHmm, okay. Let me calculate 0.68^(3/2). \n\nFirst, 0.68^(1/2) is the square root of 0.68. Let me approximate that. The square of 0.8246 is about 0.68 (since 0.8^2 = 0.64, 0.82^2 = 0.6724, 0.8246^2 = approx 0.68). \n\nSo sqrt(0.68) \u2248 0.8246. \n\nThen 0.68^(3/2) is 0.68 * 0.8246 \u2248 0.68 * 0.8246. Let's compute that:\n\n0.68 * 0.8 = 0.544, and 0.68 * 0.0246 \u2248 0.0167. Adding up, total \u2248 0.544 + 0.0167 \u2248 0.5607.",

The decay probability over a time interval is 1 - S(t). \n\nGiven that the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, that means the survival probability after 100 minutes is 68% (since 100% -32% = 68%). So S(100) = 0.68. \n\nSo, using that, I can find \u03bb. Let me write that equation:\n\ne^(-\u03bb * 100) = 0.68 \n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n-\u03bb*100 = ln(0.68)\n\nSo \u03bb = - ln(0.68)/100 \n\nLet me compute that. ln(0.68) is approximately... Hmm. Let me think. Since ln(0.5) is about -0.6931, ln(0.7) is around -0.3567. Let me check 0.68. Maybe approximate it numerically.",
          "text2": "Alternatively, let me structure this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me model the decay. The survival probability (probability it hasn't decayed by time t) is S(t) = e^(-\u03bbt). The decay probability up to time t is 1 - S(t). Given that after 100 minutes, the decay probability is 32%, so 1 - S(100) = 0.32 \u2192 S(100) = 0.68. Therefore, e^(-\u03bb*100) = 0.68. Taking natural log of both sides: -\u03bb*100 = ln(0.68). So \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100. Let me compute that. Let me see, ln(0.68) is approximately, well, ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, so 0.68 is a bit less, so maybe ln(0.68) is around -0.385. Let me check with calculator steps:",

The question is, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes, so from now (t=50) to t=200 minutes. \n\nThe memoryless property says that the probability of surviving an additional time t is equal to the probability of surviving t time units from the start. So the conditional probability that it survives beyond t_total given it has survived up to now is the same as the survival probability for t_total - t_initial. \n\nTherefore, the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200 is equal to 1 - survival probability for 150 minutes. \n\nSo first, let's compute the survival probability over 150 minutes, S(150) = e^(-\u03bb*150).
