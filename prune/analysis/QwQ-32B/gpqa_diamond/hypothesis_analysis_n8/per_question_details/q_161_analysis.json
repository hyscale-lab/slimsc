The original \u03bb1 is the mean free path of the gas molecules colliding with each other. The electrons' mean free path \u03bb2 would depend on their interactions with the gas molecules. The mean free path for electrons is calculated as \u03bb_e = 1/(n \u03c3_e), where \u03c3_e is the cross-section for electron-molecule collision.

Well, for molecular collisions, the cross-section is determined by the effective area for collision between two molecules. For electron collisions with a molecule, the cross-section is the area where the electron can interact with the molecule (either through Coulomb forces, etc.).

The mean time \u03c4 is 1/(n \u03c3 v_rel), where v_rel is the relative speed. \n\nThe relative speed between the electron and the gas molecule would be approximately the electron's speed since the electron's velocity is much higher than the thermal speed of the gas molecules.

The key here is that the mean free path in question here is the one for the electrons, because they are scattering off the gas molecules.",
