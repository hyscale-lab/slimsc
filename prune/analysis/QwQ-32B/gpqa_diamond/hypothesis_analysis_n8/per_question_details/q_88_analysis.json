If the cells are in the process of proliferating in response to the antigen, then the process causing the variability in their variable regions would be their original VDJ rearrangement. The high variability between cells would be due to the different VDJ combinations each cell has. So that's a result of VDJ recombination.",

This is what gives each B cell its unique antigen receptor. So in a population of B cells, each has a different V region due to VDJ recombination. \n\nSomatic hypermutation is a process that occurs after activation, introducing point mutations into the variable regions to increase affinity. So if the cells are proliferating in response to the antigen (like in a germinal center), then the variable regions would have mutations leading to diversity. \n\nIn this case, since the cells are in the Peyer's patches (secondary lymphoid), which is where the B cells would encounter the antigen. The initial activation would lead them to proliferate. At that point, the variability would still be from their VDJ rearrangement, unless the process of somatic hypermutation has already started. \n\nBut the question says \"observe high variability\". If the B cells are just starting to respond, maybe the high variability comes from the different B cells that have receptors specific to the antigen, each with their own VDJ combinations. So that would be VDJ recombination. But the options are A and D.",
