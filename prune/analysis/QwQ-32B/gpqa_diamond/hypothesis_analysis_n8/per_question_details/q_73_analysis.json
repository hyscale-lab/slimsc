But that would be 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c, right? But that's in the classical sense. But since these are relativistic speeds, maybe I need to use the relativistic velocity subtraction?\n\nHold on, the formula for adding velocities in special relativity is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/c\u00b2), but here maybe it's different because we need to find the relative velocity from one frame to another. Let me clarify: suppose astronaut A is moving at 0.6c relative to a stationary observer, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c. What is the speed of A as observed from B's frame? That would be the relative velocity between them. So using the relativistic velocity addition formula, but in reverse. \n\nSo, if we consider B's frame, the velocity of A would be u' = (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c\u00b2), where u is the velocity of A in the original frame (0.6c), and v is the velocity of B in the original frame (0.5c).

          "text2": "Wait, actually, if we're calculating the velocity of the second astronaut (0.5c) as seen from the first's frame (which is moving at 0.6c), then the formula would be (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c\u00b2). So substituting:\n\nv2 is 0.5c minus v1 which is 0.6c, so numerator is (0.5c - 0.6c) = -0.1c. The denominator is 1 minus (0.6c * 0.5c)/c\u00b2. The c\u00b2 cancels, so that's (0.3c\u00b2)/c\u00b2 = 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative velocity is (-0.1c)/0.7 \u2248 -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates direction opposite to the original direction, but since they're asking for speed, the magnitude is about 0.14c. So that would be about 0.14c. So the relative speed is option C or D, which have 0.14c. \n\nLooking at the options: option C has 0.14c and E=5.96 mc\u00b2, and D has 0.14c and E=5mc\u00b2. So now the question is the total energy of the system. How to compute that?\n\nThe total energy would be the sum of their individual relativistic energies. Each astronaut's energy is gamma * m * c\u00b2, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). \n\nFirst astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. So gamma1 is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy is gamma1 * 2m c\u00b2 = 1.25 * 2m c\u00b2 = 2.5 m c\u00b2.\n\nSecond astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma2 is 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) since (0.5c)^2/c\u00b2 is 0.25. sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3/4) so sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866. Thus gamma2 = 1/(sqrt(0.75)) \u2248 1.1547. So energy is 1.1547 * 3m c\u00b2 \u2248 3.464 m c\u00b2.\n\nAdding both energies: 2.5 + 3.464 \u2248 5.964 m c\u00b2. So that's approximately 5.96 m c\u00b2.

Since they're moving in the same direction, the total energy would be the sum of their individual relativistic energies. Each has kinetic energy plus rest energy.
