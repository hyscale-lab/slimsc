          "text1": "Alternatively, maybe there's a better way. Since gamma is large (since the energy is much higher than the rest mass), the particle is moving at nearly the speed of light. So we can approximate that v \u2248 c, but maybe we need to calculate it more precisely. Let me compute it properly.\n\nLet me calculate gamma again. 27 divided by 3.41 is exactly 27/3.41. Let me compute that: 3.41 * 7 = 23.87, so 27-23.87 = 3.13, so 3.13/3.41 \u22480.918. So total is 7.918. So gamma=7.918 exactly. \n\nSo, v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma)^2) \n\nLet me compute 1/(7.918)^2 first. 7.918 squared:\n\n7^2 is 49, 0.918 squared is about 0.843, but better to compute 7.918 squared:\n\n7.918 * 7.918.\n\nLet me compute 7.9 *7.9 = 62.41\n\nThen 0.018*7.9*2 = 0.2844, and 0.018^2 is 0.000324. So total (7.9 + 0.018)^2 = 62.41 + 0.2844 + 0.000324 \u2248 ~62.694. So 7.918 squared is approximately 62.694. \n\nTherefore 1/(7.918)^2 \u2248 1/62.694 \u2248 0.01595. \n\nSo 1 - 0.01595 = 0.98405. \n\nsqrt(0.98405) \u2248 let's see sqrt(0.984). The square root of 0.98 is about 0.99, so sqrt(0.98405) is a bit higher. Let me compute 0.992 squared is 0.984064. Oh, that's exactly the value. So sqrt(0.98405) \u22480.992. \n\nTherefore v \u2248 0.992c. \n\nSo the velocity is approximately 0.992 times the speed of light. \n\nSo the distance traveled is v * \u03c4. \n\nFirst, let's compute \u03c4 = gamma * \u03c4\u2080 =7.918 *8e-16 s. Let me compute that:\n\n7.918 *8 = 63.344. So \u03c4 =63.344e-16 seconds =6.3344e-15 seconds. \n\nThen, distance d = v * \u03c4. \n\nv is 0.992c. The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s. \n\nTherefore, d = 0.992 * 3e8 m/s *6.3344e-15 s.\n\nLet me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst, 0.992 *3e8 = 2.976e8 m/s.\n\nThen multiply by 6.3344e-15 s:\n\n2.976e8 *6.3344e-15 = (2.976 *6.3344) *1e-7 m. \n\nCompute 2.976 *6.3344. Let's see:\n\n2 *6.3344 =12.6688,\n\n0.976 *6.3344: \n\nFirst 1*6.3344 =6.3344,\n\nSubtract 0.024*6.3344 \u22480.152. \n\nSo 6.3344 - 0.152 =6.1824. \n\nSo total: 12.6688 +6.1824 =18.8512.",

Let me check:\n\nIf the energy E is 27 GeV, and the mass m\u2080 is 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2, then \u03b3 = E/(m\u2080 c\u00b2) = 27 / (3.41) \u2248 7.917.

But what's v here? Since the particle is relativistic, its speed v is approximately c. But more precisely, v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2). Because in relativity, v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3)^2).

To have 30% of the decays, you want the resolution to be such that 30% of the decays occur within that distance. \n\nAh, right! The exponential decay distribution means that the probability of decaying within a time t is P(t) = 1 - exp(-t/\u03c4). So if we want 30% of the decays to be observed (within the resolution distance), then we set P(t) = 0.3.

So 18.835e-7 m = 1.8835e-6 m. So about 1.88e-6 m. \n\nHmm, so the decay length is about 1.88e-6 meters. The question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. If the resolution is the minimum distance between two points that the bubble chamber can distinguish, then to see a decay, the track length must be resolved. So if a particle travels L before decaying, the resolution must be less than L so that the decay is visible. But in that case, the required resolution would be on the order of the decay length.

Let me check:\n\nIf the energy E is 27 GeV, and the mass m\u2080 is 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2, then \u03b3 = E/(m\u2080 c\u00b2) = 27 / (3.41) \u2248 7.917. So \u03b3 \u2248 7.92. \n\nThen the lifetime in the lab frame is \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 = 7.917 * 8e-16 s = 6.33e-15 seconds. \n\nBut then the distance traveled by the particle would be v * \u03c4. But what's v here? Since the particle is relativistic, its speed v is approximately c. But more precisely, v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2). Because in relativity, v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3)^2). Let me compute that. \n\nFirst compute 1/\u03b3\u00b2: (1/7.917)^2 \u2248 (0.126)^2 \u2248 0.0159. So 1 - 0.0159 = 0.984. So sqrt(0.984) \u2248 0.992. So v \u2248 0.992c. Therefore, the speed is very close to the speed of light. \n\nTherefore, the distance traveled in the lab frame would be approximately v * \u03c4 \u2248 c * \u03c4. Since \u03c4 is 6.33e-15 s, so distance d = c * 6.33e-15. \n\nBut let me compute that. The speed of light is about 3e8 m/s. So d = 3e8 m/s * 6.33e-15 s = 1.9e-6 meters.",

Because in natural units, people often quote mass in GeV, meaning m\u2080c\u00b2. So then, the total energy E is gamma times m\u2080c\u00b2. \n\nSo gamma is E/(m\u2080c\u00b2) = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV \u2248 27 / 3.41 \u2248 7.918. Let me calculate that more precisely. 3.41 times 8 is 27.28, so 27 divided by 3.41 is approximately 7.918. So \u03b3 \u2248 7.92.\n\nThen, the lifetime in the lab frame would be \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. \u03c4\u2080 is the proper lifetime, which is 8e-16 seconds. So \u03c4 = 7.92 * 8e-16 \u2248 6.336e-15 seconds. \n\nNow, the next part is figuring out how far the particle travels in that time. The distance would be v * \u03c4.

So maybe the decay length is such that the detector needs to resolve the decay point, so the resolution must be smaller than the average decay length. However, maybe the 30% refers to the fraction of decays that can be observed, so perhaps the average decay length is over the lifetime, but since the decay is exponential, the average lifetime is \u03c4, but to get 30% decayed, maybe we have to compute the time when the decayed fraction is 30% and find the corresponding length?\n\nLet me think again. The fraction of decays that have occurred by time t is 1 - exp(-t/\u03c4). We want this fraction to be at least 30%, so:\n\n1 - exp(-t/\u03c4) \u2265 0.3 \u2192 exp(-t/\u03c4) \u2264 0.7 \u2192 -t/\u03c4 \u2264 ln(0.7) \u2192 t \u2265 -\u03c4 ln(0.7). \n\nCompute that: ln(0.7) is about -0.35667. So t \u2265 -\u03c4*(-0.35667)=0.35667 \u03c4. So t \u22480.3567 \u03c4.\n\nTherefore, the required time is about 0.3567 \u03c4, so the decay length is v*t = v*(0.3567 \u03c4).",

The decay length distribution is exponential, meaning that the probability of a decay happening before time t is 1 - exp(-t/\u03c4). To have 30% of the decays, you want the resolution to be such that 30% of the decays occur within that distance. \n\nAh, right! The exponential decay distribution means that the probability of decaying within a time t is P(t) = 1 - exp(-t/\u03c4). So if we want 30% of the decays to be observed (within the resolution distance), then we set P(t) = 0.3. So:\n\n0.3 = 1 - exp(-t/\u03c4)\n\nThus, exp(-t/\u03c4) = 0.7 \u2192 -t/\u03c4 = ln(0.7) \u2192 t = -\u03c4 ln(0.7)\n\nCompute ln(0.7): natural logarithm of 0.7 is approximately -0.35667. So t = -\u03c4*(-0.35667) = \u03c4 * 0.35667\n\nSo the required time t is 0.35667 * \u03c4. \n\nTherefore, the required distance would be v * t = v * \u03c4 * 0.35667 = 0.35667 * decay length (since decay length is v*\u03c4).",
