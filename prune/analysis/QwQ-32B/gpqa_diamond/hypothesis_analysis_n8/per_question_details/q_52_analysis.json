If the energy level 2 has higher energy than level 1, then \u0394E is positive. So the exponent is negative. So as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp(-\u0394E/(kT)) decreases. Therefore, if the temperature is lower (as in the spotted case), the ratio N2/N1 would decrease. Which matches the problem's statement that the ratio decreases when there are spots.

So the energy difference \u0394E would be hc/\u03bb. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, let's compute \u0394E. The wavelength \u03bb is 1448 \u00c5, which is 1448 x 10^-10 meters. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s, c is 3e8 m/s. So:\n\n\u0394E = hc / \u03bb \n= (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10)\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nNumerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m\nDenominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m\nSo \u0394E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 \u2248 1.373e-18 J per photon.\n\nBut we need this in terms of energy per particle. Since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so converting:\n\n\u0394E (eV) = 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 \u2248 8.57 eV. Hmm, that seems high?",

Which matches the observation that when there are spots (lower T), the ratio decreases. \n\nTherefore, the ratio when there are no spots (higher T) would be higher. The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when there are no spots compared to when there are spots. So we need to compute (Ratio_no_spots)/(Ratio_spots). \n\nThe ratio between the two temperatures would be exp( -\u0394E/(k T1) ) / exp( -\u0394E/(k T2) ), where T1 is 6000 K (no spots) and T2 is 5500 K (spots).",

If the energy level 2 has higher energy than level 1, then \u0394E is positive. So the exponent is negative. So as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp(-\u0394E/(kT)) decreases. Therefore, if the temperature is lower (as in the spotted case), the ratio N2/N1 would decrease. Which matches the problem's statement that the ratio decreases when there are spots. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the ratio (N2/N1) is smaller when there are spots.
