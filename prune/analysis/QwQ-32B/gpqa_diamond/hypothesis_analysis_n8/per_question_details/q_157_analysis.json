          "text1": "Wait, but the virus's genome is RNA, so DNA sequencing would require first making cDNA. But the option says DNA sequencing, which might be possible once you reverse transcribe. But the wording here might be a bit off. The option might be incorrect because it's not specifying cDNA.",
          "text2": "Wait, but retroviruses have RNA genomes. So unless the virus has integrated into the host DNA (like in proviral form), the viral genome is RNA. So doing DNA sequencing directly might not work unless they first do reverse transcription. The option says DNA sequencing, so maybe they do RT first? But the wording is a bit ambiguous. The problem is that option C says \"DNA sequencing\" without mentioning cDNA. Maybe it's a mistake, but if the virus's genome is RNA, then DNA sequencing would require prior RT. But the option might be incorrect here.",
