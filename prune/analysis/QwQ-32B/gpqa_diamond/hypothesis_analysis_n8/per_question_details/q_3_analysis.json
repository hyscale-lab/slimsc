That might be better.\n\nLet me compute \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 first. Since |\u03c8\u27e9 is given in the \u03c3_z eigenbasis. The expectation of \u03c3_z is just the sum over the eigenvalues multiplied by the probabilities.

So when acting on |\u03c8\u27e9, which is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T, the result is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T. \n\nThen the inner product with \u27e8\u03c8| is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] \u2022 [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. \n\nYes, that gives (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2. \n\nSo that's correct. Therefore, the exact value is sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866, so 5*(0.866)=4.33. \n\nAdding to -5 gives -0.666..., so up to one decimal place is -0.7. \n\nSo the answer should be option C.",
