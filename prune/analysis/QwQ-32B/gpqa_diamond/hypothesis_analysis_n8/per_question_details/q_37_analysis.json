The mechanism would involve the aldehyde's enolate attacking the ester's carbonyl group. The diazo group is then eliminated, leading to the formation of a \u03b2-keto ester. So the product A would be a \u03b2-keto ester. Let me write that structure.\n\nThe aldehyde (propionaldehyde: CH3CH2CHO) and EDT (ethyl diazoacetate) would form a \u03b2-keto ester.

Let me think of the steps: The EDT (ethyl diazoacetate) has a diazo group, which is attacked by the aldehyde's oxygen. The diazo breaks, leading to a ylide that then undergoes a rearrangement. The final product would be an ester with the structure where the aldehyde's R group is attached to the alpha position. So the \u03b2-keto ester would have the structure: \n\nThe aldehyde's R is CH2CH3 (since propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO).

Let me think about the steps:\n\nA \u2192 B (with BuLi), then B + bromoethane \u2192 C. \n\nSo, if A is a \u03b2-keto ester, then treating it with BuLi would form a lithium enolate. The enolate would have a negative charge on the \u03b1-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl). Then, adding bromoethane (CH2BrCH3) would alkylate that enolate. The bromoethane would donate its alkyl group (the ethyl part) to the enolate, leading to the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond. \n\nSo, for example, if A is O=C(OEt)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3, then the enolate would form on the \u03b1-carbon (the CH2 next to the first carbonyl).

The first reaction gives a beta-keto ester (A). When treated with BuLi, which is a strong base, forming an enolate, then adding bromoethane (which is an alkyl halide) would perform an alkylation. So the enolate would attack the alkyl halide, leading to the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond. So the alkylation would add an ethyl group from the bromoethane to the enolate's carbon.
