So exponent term is e^{\u03b2 J * 3}.\n\nCase 2: S3 is -1.\n\nS1S2 =1*1=1; S1S3=1*(-1) =-1; S2S3=1*(-1)=-1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1. So exponent is e^{\u03b2 J*(-1)}?",

So the exponent is \u03b2Jx. So actually, exponent term is e^{\u03b2J*(sum)}.\n\nAh, right, that's an important point. Let me clarify:\n\nE = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)\n\nTherefore, -\u03b2E = \u03b2J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 )\n\nSo the exponent in the partition function term is \u03b2J*(sum of the three terms). So for each configuration, we calculate the sum of those three products, multiply by \u03b2J, and exponentiate that. Then sum all those over all configurations.\n\nOkay, so maybe I can compute the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 and count how many configurations have that sum.\n\nLet me see. Let's see the possible values of the sum.\n\nPossible values of the sum can be from -3 to +3, but not all steps may be possible. Let me think.\n\nLet me consider all possible cases:\n\nCase 1: All spins are the same (all +1 or all -1). For both cases, each pair product is +1, so the sum is 3. So sum = 3.
