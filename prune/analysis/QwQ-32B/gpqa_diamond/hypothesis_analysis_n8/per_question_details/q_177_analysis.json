So I was wrong initially because I didn't account for the Doppler effect on the temperature. The key was that the observed peak wavelengths are the same, but the actual temperatures are different because of the velocity. Star2's actual temperature is higher, so when calculating luminosity, which depends on T^4, that reduces the ratio compared to just the radius squared. \n\nSo the correct calculation gives a factor of ~2.23, which is option D.",

For instance, in the mass-luminosity relation, but that's more for main sequence stars where L ~ M^3.5 or something. But the problem says to assume they radiate as black bodies, so we have to use the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The mass given might be a red herring. Since the problem says to compute luminosity as black bodies, then mass isn't directly needed here. So the mass information is perhaps irrelevant.",
