Or maybe not. Let's think numerically. \n\nLet me assume some approximate values. \n\nLet\u2019s suppose that the B-8 contribution to Band1 is X, and to Band2 is Y, where Y > X (since the B-8 flux increases with energy in this range). \n\nSuppose that the pp-I neutrinos contribute equally to both bands (since their max is 1.4 MeV, so their distribution in the 700-900 keV range may be roughly similar, though it also has a distribution). \n\nThe Be-7 contributes to Band1 but not Band2. Let\u2019s denote:\n\nBand1 (originally) = pp-I_1 + B-8_1 + Be-7_1 \n\nBand2 (originally) = pp-I_2 + B-8_2 \n\nAssuming that the pp-I contributions to each band are similar (say, A), then:\n\nBand1_new = A + Be-7_1 \n\nBand2_new = A \n\nTherefore, the ratio (Band1_new/Band2_new) = (A + Be_7_1)/A = 1 + (Be_7_1)/A \n\nIf Be_7_1 is a small fraction of A, then the ratio is approximately 1. But if B-8's contributions were significant, then the original Band2 had a higher contribution from B-8, so when removed, the ratio could be higher or lower?",
          "text2": "Wait, so the B-8 neutrinos in band2 (800-900) would have a contribution from B-8 being E=800-900 keV. The Be-7 contribution is a delta function at ~860 keV. \n\nSo before stopping pp-III, the flux in band2 was (B-8 in band2) + (Be-7 flux). Since Be-7 is a sharp line at ~860 keV, the Be-7 contribution is concentrated in a tiny energy range. The total contribution from Be-7 would be a small fraction compared to B-8's continuum. For instance, if the B-8 flux in band2 is, say, 5e10 and Be-7 is 3e9, then the total is ~5.3e10. So removing the Be-7 would reduce band2's flux by about 6%, so the ratio band1/band2 would be (B-8 band1)/(B-8 band2) \u22480.78, but the options don't have that. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let's think differently. Maybe the energy of the Be-7 neutrino is exactly 862 keV (I think the actual value is around there). So that's precisely in band2. So when you stop pp-III, you're removing a line at ~860 keV from band2. \n\nThe B-8 neutrinos in band2 (800-900) would include all B-8 neutrinos between 800 and 900 keV. \n\nThe question is, what is the ratio of B-8 band1 to B-8 band2.",
