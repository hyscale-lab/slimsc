Maybe I should recall the exact expression. \n\nActually, the standard formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 a (1 - A)) ), where R_star is the radius of the star, but perhaps more accurately, considering the star's luminosity L = 4\u03c0R_star\u00b2\u03c3T_star^4, so substituting:\n\nT_eq = ( (L(1 - A)/(16 \u03c0 \u03c3 a\u00b2) ) )^(1/4 )\n\nBut regardless, since L and \u03c3 are constants for the star, and A is the same for all planets, the equilibrium temperature T is proportional to (1/a)^(1/2).

So the ratio T1/T2 =1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, the ratio T2/T3 is 2.3. So T2 is higher than T3, so Planet3 is farther out than Planet2. \n\nSo for Planet2 and Planet3: T2/T3 = sqrt(D3/D2). Therefore D3/D2 = (T2/T3)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29. \n\nSo, if we can get the distances in terms of D1, then we can relate them. \n\nSo let me denote D1 as the orbital distance of Planet1. Then D2 = D1*(T1/T2)^2 = D1*(1.4)^2 = D1*1.96. \n\nThen D3 is D2*(D3/D2) = D2*(5.29) = D1*1.96 *5.29. Let me compute that: 1.96 *5.29. Let's see, 2 *5.29 is 10.58, minus 0.04*5.29 (since 1.96 is 2-0.04). So 0.04*5.29 is 0.2116. So 10.58 -0.2116 = 10.3684. So D3 is approximately 10.37 times D1. \n\nNow, we need to find the orbital period ratio between Planet3 and Planet1. \n\nKepler's third law states that (P^2)/(a^3) = constant for planets around the same star. Since all three planets are around the same star, the ratio of their periods squared is equal to the ratio of their semi-major axes cubed. \n\nSo, (P3/P1)^2 = (D3/D1)^3 \u2192 (P3/P1) = (D3/D1)^(3/2). \n\nWe found that D3/D1 is approximately 10.37. Let me compute 10.37^(3/2). \n\nFirst, 10.37 squared is (approx) 10.37^2 = let's calculate: 10^2 is 100, 0.37^2 is ~0.1369, and cross term 2*10*0.37 =7.4. So total is 100 +7.4 +0.1369 = 107.5369. But actually, 10.37*10.37: 10*10=100, 10*0.37=3.7, 0.37*10=3.7, and 0.37^2. So (10 +0.37)^2 = 100 + 2*10*0.37 +0.37\u00b2 =100 +7.4 +0.1369=107.5369. \n\nThen the cube of 10.37 is 10.37 * 107.5369.

So that would mean Planet3 is farther out.\n\nSo using the same formula as before, for Planet2 and 3:\n\nT2 / T3 = (a3/a2)^{1/2} \u2192 2.3 = (a3/a2)^{1/2} \u2192 a3/a2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29.\n\nSo a3 is 5.29 times a2.\n\nNow, since a2 is 1.96 a1, then a3 is 5.29 * 1.96 a1 \u2248 let's calculate that.\n\n1.96 * 5.29: 2*5.29 is 10.58 minus 0.04*5.29 (since 1.96 is 2-0.04). 0.04*5.29 is 0.2116. So 10.58 - 0.2116 \u2248 10.368. So a3 \u2248 10.37 a1. So the orbital distances are in ratios a1 : a2 \u22481.96 a1 : a3 \u2248 10.37 a1.\n\nNow, orbital period depends on the orbital radius via Kepler's third law. Since they're all orbiting the same star, P^2 \u221d a^3.\n\nSo the ratio of periods between Planet3 and Planet1 would be (P3/P1) = (a3/a1)^(3/2).\n\nWe have a3/a1 \u2248 10.37, so taking that to the 3/2 power.\n\nLet me compute (10.37)^(3/2).

If it's the same as the previous, where Planet1 vs Planet2 was T1/T2 =1.4, then here T2/T3 =2.3.

Then \"between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3\"\u2014so T2/T3 = 2.3?\n\nAssuming that, so T2 divided by T3 is 2.3, meaning that T3 is T2/2.3, so T3 is lower. So that would mean Planet3 is farther out.\n\nSo using the same formula as before, for Planet2 and 3:\n\nT2 / T3 = (a3/a2)^{1/2} \u2192 2.3 = (a3/a2)^{1/2} \u2192 a3/a2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29.\n\nSo a3 is 5.29 times a2.\n\nNow, since a2 is 1.96 a1, then a3 is 5.29 * 1.96 a1 \u2248 let's calculate that.\n\n1.96 * 5.29: 2*5.29 is 10.58 minus 0.04*5.29 (since 1.96 is 2-0.04). 0.04*5.29 is 0.2116. So 10.58 - 0.2116 \u2248 10.368. So a3 \u2248 10.37 a1. So the orbital distances are in ratios a1 : a2 \u22481.96 a1 : a3 \u2248 10.37 a1.\n\nNow, orbital period depends on the orbital radius via Kepler's third law. Since they're all orbiting the same star, P^2 \u221d a^3.\n\nSo the ratio of periods between Planet3 and Planet1 would be (P3/P1) = (a3/a1)^(3/2).\n\nWe have a3/a1 \u2248 10.37, so taking that to the 3/2 power.\n\nLet me compute (10.37)^(3/2). Let's see:\n\nFirst, sqrt(10.37) is approx 3.22 (since 3.2^2=10.24). So sqrt(10.37) \u22483.22. Then 10.37^(3/2) = (sqrt(10.37))^3 \u2248 (3.22)^3.\n\n3.22 cubed: 3^3 is 27, 0.22^3 is small, but let's compute:\n\n3.22 *3.22 = 10.3684, then multiply by 3.22 again:\n\n10.3684 *3 = 31.1052, plus 10.3684 *0.22 \u22482.281.

          "text1": "Wait the wording is \"between Planet2 and Planet3\", but the problem says \"ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3\". So that's T2/T3 = 2.3 or T3/T2? Need to clarify. \n\nThe question says \"the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet2 and Planet3\". If it's the same as the previous, where Planet1 vs Planet2 was T1/T2 =1.4, then here T2/T3 =2.3. Therefore, T2 is higher than T3, so Planet3 is farther away. \n\nThus, the ratio of a3/a2 would be (T2/T3)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29. \n\nTherefore, the orbital distances are as follows: \n\nLet me denote a1, a2, a3 as the semi-major axes. \n\nWe have a2/a1 = (T1/T2)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \n\na3/a2 = (T2/T3)^2 = (2.3)^2 \u2248 5.29 \n\nThus, a3/a1 = a3/a2 * a2/a1 = 5.29 * 1.96 \u2248 ?\n\nCalculating 5.29 *1.96: Let's compute 5 *1.96 =9.8, 0.29*1.96\u22480.5684 \u2192 total \u224810.3684. So approximately 10.37. \n\nBut we need the ratio of the orbital periods. Kepler's third law: (P1/P3)^2 = (a1^3)/(a3^3) \u2192 (P3/P1)^2 = (a3/a1)^3 \u2192 P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2).",
          "text2": "Wait, the question says \"the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4\". So the ratio T1/T2 =1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, the ratio T2/T3 is 2.3. So T2 is higher than T3, so Planet3 is farther out than Planet2. \n\nSo for Planet2 and Planet3: T2/T3 = sqrt(D3/D2). Therefore D3/D2 = (T2/T3)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29. \n\nSo, if we can get the distances in terms of D1, then we can relate them. \n\nSo let me denote D1 as the orbital distance of Planet1. Then D2 = D1*(T1/T2)^2 = D1*(1.4)^2 = D1*1.96. \n\nThen D3 is D2*(D3/D2) = D2*(5.29) = D1*1.96 *5.29. Let me compute that: 1.96 *5.29. Let's see, 2 *5.29 is 10.58, minus 0.04*5.29 (since 1.96 is 2-0.04). So 0.04*5.29 is 0.2116. So 10.58 -0.2116 = 10.3684. So D3 is approximately 10.37 times D1. \n\nNow, we need to find the orbital period ratio between Planet3 and Planet1. \n\nKepler's third law states that (P^2)/(a^3) = constant for planets around the same star. Since all three planets are around the same star, the ratio of their periods squared is equal to the ratio of their semi-major axes cubed. \n\nSo, (P3/P1)^2 = (D3/D1)^3 \u2192 (P3/P1) = (D3/D1)^(3/2). \n\nWe found that D3/D1 is approximately 10.37. Let me compute 10.37^(3/2). \n\nFirst, 10.37 squared is (approx) 10.37^2 = let's calculate: 10^2 is 100, 0.37^2 is ~0.1369, and cross term 2*10*0.37 =7.4. So total is 100 +7.4 +0.1369 = 107.5369. But actually, 10.37*10.37: 10*10=100, 10*0.37=3.7, 0.37*10=3.7, and 0.37^2. So (10 +0.37)^2 = 100 + 2*10*0.37 +0.37\u00b2 =100 +7.4 +0.1369=107.5369. \n\nThen the cube of 10.37 is 10.37 * 107.5369.
