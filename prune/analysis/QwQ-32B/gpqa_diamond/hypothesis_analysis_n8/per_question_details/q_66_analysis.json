The question lists them as separate options. So the correct answer must include all symmetries that all operators must respect. Since Poincare includes Lorentz, if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But the question says \"must be respected by all operators\". So perhaps the answer must include both 1 and 2, because Poincare is required, and Lorentz is a subset. Hmm, but actually, Poincare symmetry is a combination. So if a theory has Poincare symmetry, then it has Lorentz symmetry. But since the question lists them as separate options, maybe the answer requires both 1 and 2 to be included. However, the SMEFT operators must respect the symmetries of the Standard Model, which includes Poincare. So 1 and 2 are both required. \n\nCPT is a must because of the CPT theorem. But CP isn't. So the correct options would be 1,2,4. Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. Option D includes 1,3,4 which would be wrong because of CP. So the answer should be C. Let me confirm.
