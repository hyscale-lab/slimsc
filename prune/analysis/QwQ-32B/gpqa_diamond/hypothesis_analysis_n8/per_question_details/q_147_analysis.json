Or maybe both are considered to have negligible kinetic energy compared to their rest mass? That's a common assumption in these kinds of problems when particles are \"slowly moving.\" So perhaps their total energy is approximately their rest mass energy.\n\nThe reaction is p + p\u0304 \u2192 2A\u207a + 2A\u207b. Since charge must be conserved, each side has a charge of (proton is +1, antiproton is -1, so total 0 on the left). On the right, each A+ is +1 and each A- is -1, so 2*(+1) + 2*(-1) = 0. So charge is conserved. Good.\n\nNow, to find the velocity of particle A. Since the antiproton is slowly moving, perhaps we can assume that the initial kinetic energy is negligible, so the total energy is just the rest mass energy of the proton plus the antiproton. Let me note that the rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c\u00b2, so the total rest mass energy of the system is 2*938 = 1876 MeV. \n\nThe products are four particles of A (two positive, two negative).

But maybe the standard approach here is to consider that the initial particles are at rest, so their total momentum is zero, so the final particles must also have zero net momentum. Therefore, the two positive and two negative particles must move in such a way that their momenta cancel out. But since there are two of each, maybe they are moving symmetrically in opposite directions. \n\nSo the key here is to calculate the velocity of the particles A. Since the mass of A is given as m_A c\u00b2 = 300 MeV. The proton mass is about 938 MeV/c\u00b2. Since the antiproton has the same mass as the proton, the total rest mass energy of the initial system is 2*938 = 1876 MeV.

No, so the simplest assumption is that the four particles are emitted symmetrically in opposite directions, each with the same magnitude of momentum. Let me model the system such that two go in the +x direction and two in the -x direction, each with momentum p and -p respectively. Then the total momentum would be (2p - 2p) = 0. So the momentum of each pair cancels. \n\nTherefore, each particle (regardless of charge) has the same magnitude of momentum p, but direction opposite for the pairs. Since they all have the same mass, their speeds would be the same. So each particle's momentum is p, so the total energy of each particle is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_A c\u00b2)^2 ).

So we can treat them as moving at speed v, with momentum p = gamma * m_A * v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. \n\nNow, energy conservation.

Hmm, perhaps the easiest way is to model this as a system where the four particles are emitted symmetrically. Since the total momentum is zero, their momenta must cancel.
