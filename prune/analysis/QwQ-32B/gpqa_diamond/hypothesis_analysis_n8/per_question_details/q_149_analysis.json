Double coupling usually refers to when a proton is coupled to two different nuclei, leading to more complex splitting patterns. But the problem states that spin-spin coupling is ruled out. The question says the coupling pattern was analyzed and spin-spin isn't the reason, so maybe that's not it. So C might not be correct.\n\nOption D: diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR chemical shifts can differ. Since they are not mirror images, their mass spectra would still be the same (same molecular formula), so the LC-MS would show two peaks with same mass.
