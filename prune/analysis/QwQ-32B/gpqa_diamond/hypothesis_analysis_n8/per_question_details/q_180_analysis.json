Let's denote each pair as two charges on the sphere. The problem is that their mutual distances vary depending on their arrangement, but to minimize the total energy, we need the configuration where the sum of 1/d_ij is minimized (since each term in the sum is (k*(2e)^2)/d_ij, so to minimize the total energy, we need to maximize the distances). \n\nThe minimal energy configuration would be when the 12 charges are arranged as far apart as possible. The regular icosahedron has the maximum minimal distance between any two vertices on a sphere, so that's the configuration we should use. \n\nNow, I need to find the edge length (distance between vertices) for a regular icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius R=2m. Let's recall the formula for the edge length of a regular icosahedron in terms of the radius. \n\nThe formula for the radius (circumradius) of a regular icosahedron with edge length a is R = a * sqrt( (10 + 2*sqrt(5))/20 ).

So the sum over all pairs of the reciprocal of their distances.\n\nNow, the pairs are of two types: those between the central charge and each outer charge, and those between two outer charges.\n\nFirst, let's compute the number of pairs. There are 12 outer charges and 1 central. The central charge has 12 pairs with each outer. Then, the outer charges have C(12,2) pairs among themselves. So total pairs: 12 + (12*11)/2 = 12 + 66 = 78 pairs.\n\nThe energy contributions are:\n\nFirst, for the central charge and each outer: each pair has distance 2m. There are 12 such pairs.

But if we are to find the minimal total energy, then the minimal energy would require the outer charges to be as far apart as possible from each other, which would maximize the distances d_ij, thereby minimizing each term (since 1/d_ij is smaller).

Since all charges are 2e, each pair will have U = k*(2e)^2 / r, where r is the distance between them.\n\nSo the total potential energy of the system is the sum over all pairs. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the interactions between the central charge (at P) and each of the 12 charges. Each of these pairs contributes U = k*(2e)^2 / (2m), since they are 2 meters apart.

The problem here is that the distance between each pair of those 12 charges varies depending on their arrangement. To find the minimal total energy, we need to arrange the 12 charges such that the sum of 1/r_ij for all pairs is minimized, but since we are to find the minimum energy, that's the case when the configuration is optimal. \n\nHowever, the problem might be expecting that we can compute it without considering the exact arrangement, perhaps by assuming some symmetry or maybe even a specific configuration like a regular icosahedron?",
