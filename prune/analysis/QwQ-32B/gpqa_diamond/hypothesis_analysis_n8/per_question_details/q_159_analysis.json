Let me think.\n\nThe Lyman-alpha forest is a series of absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars, caused by intervening neutral hydrogen gas clouds along the line of sight. These absorption lines are redshifted, so their wavelength depends on the redshift of the intervening clouds. The Lyman-alpha line is at 121.6 nm in the rest frame, so if the absorption is happening at a redshift z, the observed wavelength would be \u03bb = 121.6*(1+z) nm. Now, if the observed peak is at 790 nm, maybe that's the Lyman-alpha emission line of the quasar itself.",
          "text2": "Wait, but why is there a drop in flux below 790 nm? That might be the Lyman-alpha forest effect, where intergalactic medium absorbs the light at shorter wavelengths (higher redshifts?), so the observed wavelength corresponds to the rest-frame Lyman-alpha line. So the peak here is the end of the Gunn-Peterson trough? Maybe the drop is because beyond that wavelength (shorter observed, meaning shorter in observed frame but longer in the quasar's frame?), so perhaps the Lyman-alpha absorption is causing the flux to be absorbed below that wavelength. \n\nSo if the observed Lyman-alpha emission line is at 790 nm, then the redshift z can be calculated. The Lyman-alpha line in the rest frame is 121.6 nm. So observed wavelength \u03bb_obs = \u03bb_rest * (1 + z). So 790 = 121.6*(1+z).

Let me think.\n\nThe Lyman-alpha forest is a series of absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars, caused by intervening neutral hydrogen gas clouds along the line of sight. These absorption lines are redshifted, so their wavelength depends on the redshift of the intervening clouds. The Lyman-alpha line is at 121.6 nm in the rest frame, so if the absorption is happening at a redshift z, the observed wavelength would be \u03bb = 121.6*(1+z) nm. Now, if the observed peak is at 790 nm, maybe that's the Lyman-alpha emission line of the quasar itself.",

That might be the Lyman-alpha forest effect, where intergalactic medium absorbs the light at shorter wavelengths (higher redshifts?), so the observed wavelength corresponds to the rest-frame Lyman-alpha line.

Maybe the drop is because beyond that wavelength (shorter observed, meaning shorter in observed frame but longer in the quasar's frame?), so perhaps the Lyman-alpha absorption is causing the flux to be absorbed below that wavelength. \n\nSo if the observed Lyman-alpha emission line is at 790 nm, then the redshift z can be calculated.

Therefore, the first calculation is correct: z\u22487.66.\n\nTherefore, the redshift is around 7.66.
