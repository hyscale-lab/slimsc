Let me recall:\n\n- Nitro group (NO2) is deactivating and meta-directing.\n- Alkoxy groups (like ethoxy) are activating and ortho/para directing.\n- Alkyl groups like tert-butyl (which is a tertiary alkyl) are activating and ortho/para directing.\n\nThe synthesis steps usually involve adding substituents in a way that each subsequent group is placed in the correct position relative to the previous ones. \n\nStarting with benzene (no substituents), the first substitution will determine the first position.
