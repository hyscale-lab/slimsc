The molecule might have some flexibility to tautomerize. For example, the enol form would have an OH group and a double bond between adjacent carbons.

Therefore, the compound that does NOT show tautomerism (A) would be benzoquinone. So for part A, the answer would be benzoquinone (option B or D, looking at the options).\n\nMoving on to part B: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

So if cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism, then the answer for A would be benzoquinone (so A = benzoquinone). \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption B says A = benzoquinone, B = methyl... which is the case I thought. \n\nOption D says A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate, but the B part is wrong because I think methyl shows optical isomerism. \n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.",
