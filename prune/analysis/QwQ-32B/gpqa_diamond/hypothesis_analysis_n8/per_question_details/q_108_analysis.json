The H-alpha is 656 nm (n=3 to 2), H-beta is 486 nm (n=4 to 2), H-gamma is 434 nm (n=5 to 2), etc. So 486.1 nm corresponds to a transition from n=4 to n=2. So the energy difference \u0394E between levels n=4 and n=2 would be the transition energy here.\n\nNow the question is to compare the paramagnetic term <H> (which is the expectation value of the paramagnetic term) with this \u0394E. \n\nFirst, let's compute the order of magnitude of \u0394E. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by the formula E_n = -13.6 eV / n\u00b2. So the transition between n=4 and n=2 would be \u0394E = E_2 - E_4. Since E_2 is higher (less negative) than E_4, the actual energy difference when going from 4 to 2 is E_2 - E_4 = [ -13.6/(2\u00b2) + 13.6/(4\u00b2) ] but maybe I should compute the absolute value.

          "text1": "Wait, actually, the transition energy \u0394E (the energy of the emitted photon) would be E_initial - E_final. Since the electron is going from higher n to lower n, the photon energy is (E_4 - E_2). Let me compute that:\n\nE_4 = -13.6 eV /16 = -0.85 eV, E_2 = -3.4 eV. So E_4 - E_2 = (-0.85) - (-3.4) = 2.55 eV. So the transition energy \u0394E is 2.55 eV.\n\nNow, the Zeeman energy shift for a given m would be \u0394H = \u03bc_B * B * m. Let's compute \u03bc_B * B. \n\nThe Bohr magneton \u03bc_B is approximately 9.27e-24 J/T. The magnetic field B is 1 T. So \u03bc_B * B = 9.27e-24 J. To convert this to eV, since 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, so 9.27e-24 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV \u2248 5.8e-5 eV. So that's about 5.8e-5 eV. Then multiply by m, which is the magnetic quantum number. Since m can be from -l to +l, but the question says \"small values of m\". Let's assume m is of order 1 (since it's small). So the Zeeman energy shift would be on the order of 5.8e-5 eV. Compare that to the transition energy of 2.55 eV. \n\nSo 5.8e-5 is much smaller than 2.55. So the Zeeman term is much smaller than the transition energy. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term \u27e8H\u27e9 is much less than \u0394E, so the correct answer would be option C.",

Since n=4 is higher energy than n=2, the energy difference is E_4 - E_2 = (-0.85) - (-3.4) = 2.55 eV. So the transition energy is about 2.55 eV. That's the \u0394E here.\n\nNow, the paramagnetic term's magnitude is |\u0394H| = \u03bc_B * m * B. Let's plug in the numbers.\n\n\u03bc_B is the Bohr magneton, which is approximately 9.27 x 10^-24 J/T. The magnetic field B is 1 T. The m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. The problem says m is small, so maybe m is on the order of 1? Let's assume m=1 for the maximum possible value here (since it's small).",

Then the paramagnetic term would be about 5.79e-5 eV * m. So if m is ~1, then ~6e-5 eV. \n\nCompare that to \u0394E of ~2.55 eV. The ratio would be (6e-5) / 2.55 ~ 2e-5, so the paramagnetic term is much smaller than \u0394E. Therefore, \u27e8H\u27e9 << \u0394E, so the answer would be option C.",

Anyway, the question is about the order of magnitude, so even if m is up to 3 (for example, in the n=4 level, the maximum l is 3, so m could be up to 3), but the problem states m is small, so maybe m is like 1 or 2. Let's see.\n\nSo let's compute |\u0394H| in eV. First, \u03bc_B = 9.27e-24 J/T. Multiply by B (1 T) gives 9.27e-24 J. Now, to convert that to eV: 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 9.27e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV \u2248 5.8e-5 eV. So even if m is 3, then 3 * 5.8e-5 eV \u2248 1.7e-4 eV. The transition energy is 2.55 eV, which is way larger.
