Find the time t in the Galaxy's frame corresponding to t0 = 50 s in the ejecta's frame. \n\n2. Multiply that time by the ejecta's speed (60,000 km/s) to get the distance. \n\nSo first, compute gamma. \n\nThe velocity v is 60,000 km/s. But we need to express this as a fraction of the speed of light. Let me calculate v/c. \n\nThe speed of light c is approximately 3e5 km/s (since c \u2248 300,000 km/s). \n\nSo v = 6e4 km/s. \n\nv/c = 6e4 / 3e5 = 0.2. So that's 0.2c. \n\nTherefore, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) \n\nPlugging in v/c =0.2: \n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 -0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96). \n\nCalculating sqrt(0.96). Let's see, sqrt(0.96) is sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(24/25) * sqrt(4) ?",
