Then with T=0, that equation requires that S+L+1 is even \u2192 S+L is odd. But according to symmetry, it must be even. \n\nHmm. Since the problem gives that formula, perhaps I should proceed with it, even if it seems contradictory to my analysis. Let me assume that the problem's condition is correct and use it as per the question's instruction. \n\nSo, given that the final NN state has T=0, then per the problem's condition:\n\nT = S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 0 = (S + L +1) mod2 \u2192 S + L +1 is even \u2192 S + L is odd. \n\nTherefore, in the final state, the sum of spin and orbital angular momentum must be odd. \n\nNow, the question is about possible partial waves in the emission of particle X. The options give transitions from the initial NN state (1S0) to the final NN plus X. \n\nThe problem also mentions conservation of angular momentum and parity. \n\nThe initial state is 1S0. Let me parse that term symbol. \n\nThe term symbol is (2S+1)L_J. \n\nHere, the initial state is 1S0. \n\nSo, the total spin S_initial = (term symbol's first number minus 1)/2 \u2192 (1-1)/2=0. So S_initial =0. \n\nThe L_initial is the L in the term symbol, which is S (spectroscopic notation, so L=0). \n\nThe total angular momentum J_initial is 0 (from the J in the term symbol). \n\nSo initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0. \n\nNow, the final state of the NN must have certain S and L such that T(NN)=0 (so following the condition S + L must be odd, according to the problem's formula). \n\nAdditionally, the particle X has angular momentum l (since the lowercase letter in the options gives the angular momentum state of X). \n\nWe need to ensure that the total angular momentum is conserved. The initial J is 0, so the final total angular momentum must also be 0 (since angular momentum is conserved). \n\nThe final state consists of the NN system plus the emitted particle X. \n\nThe total angular momentum J_total must be the vector sum of the NN's total angular momentum J_NN and the angular momentum of X, J_X (which is sqrt(l(l+1))\u0127, so the magnitude is l, but direction matters). However, since the initial J_total is 0, the final must also have J_total =0. \n\nThus, the NN and X must have their angular momenta such that J_NN and J_X can combine to give total J=0. \n\nMoreover, parity must be conserved. \n\nLet me recall that parity of the initial state is (-1)^L_initial. Since L_initial is 0 (S state), parity is +1. \n\nThe parity of the final state must also be +1. \n\nThe final state's parity is the product of the NN's parity and the X's parity. \n\nThe NN's parity is (-1)^{L_NN} (since their orbital angular momentum is L_NN).

So S and L must have different parity. \n\nNow, let's look at each option and check the conditions. Each option is written as an initial to final transition plus the emitted particle's angular momentum (the lowercase letter like p, f, s etc., which is the spectroscopic notation for L of the emitted particle X). \n\nEach option's final NN state's term symbol gives us the S(NN) and L(NN) (from the L part in the term symbol), and the emitted particle's L (from the lowercase letter).
