To find the number per unit distance, we have to express this in terms of distance.\n\nLet me do the coordinate transformation. Let\u2019s let plx = p = 1/r (since p = 1/d in parsecs, so here r is distance, so p =1/r). So when plx is p, the distance is r = 1/p. The differential dplx = dp = - (1/r\u00b2) dr.

To express this in terms of dr, we substitute p = 1/r and dp = - (1/r\u00b2) dr. So dN = K*(1/( (1/r)^5 )) * ( - (1/r\u00b2) dr ). The negative can be dropped since we're considering the magnitude.

The number of stars in a certain parallax range isn't just the function itself, but you have to account for the differential. Let me think again. Let's suppose that the number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is N(plx) dplx. But the question is asking about the number of stars per unit distance, so per unit r. So we need to express this in terms of dr instead of dplx. \n\nFirst, since plx = 1/r, then dplx/dr = -1/r\u00b2 (since derivative of 1/r with respect to r is -1/r\u00b2). Therefore, dplx = - (1/r\u00b2) dr. The absolute value would be (1/r\u00b2) dr. So to convert the differential, we can write dplx = (dr)/r\u00b2.

Let me think of another approach. \n\nSuppose the number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is proportional to (1/plx^5) dplx.
