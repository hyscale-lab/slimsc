The tetramethylcyclopentadiene has four methyl groups on adjacent carbons, which are quite bulky. The reaction would proceed in a conformation where the bulky groups are placed trans to each other in the newly formed ring to minimize steric interactions.\n\nAssuming that, the major product would have the bulky methyl groups on one side, leading to certain protons being close. For instance, if the methyl groups are on the same face, their adjacent protons would be close to other groups. \n\nLooking at the options, if the cross-peak is between a methyl group (6H singlet at 1 ppm) and another proton (like a CH2), that could be the case.
