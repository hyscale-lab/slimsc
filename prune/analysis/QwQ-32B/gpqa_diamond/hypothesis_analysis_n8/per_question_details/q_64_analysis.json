Since Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent, maybe it's absorbing water. So if the gas mixture had H2O, then that's absorbed here, increasing tube 1's mass by 3.6g. Then tube 2 (Ca(OH)2) didn't change, so whatever would react with limewater (like CO2) isn't present, meaning the gas mixture after tube 1 doesn't have CO2. So perhaps CO2 was already removed by tube 1? Or maybe the gas that would react with Ca(OH)2 wasn't in the original mixture. Hmm.\n\nTube 3 (red hot Cu) gains 0.80g. Since it forms CuO, that implies that oxygen was present in the gas mixture. The copper is initially in a red-hot state (maybe as Cu metal?), and the O comes from the gas.

The total mass of the salts is converted into the products, so maybe we can track the masses through each step.\n\nFirst, tube 1 (Mg(ClO4)2) gains 3.60g. Since Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent, maybe it's absorbing water. So if the gas mixture had H2O, then that's absorbed here, increasing tube 1's mass by 3.6g. Then tube 2 (Ca(OH)2) didn't change, so whatever would react with limewater (like CO2) isn't present, meaning the gas mixture after tube 1 doesn't have CO2. So perhaps CO2 was already removed by tube 1? Or maybe the gas that would react with Ca(OH)2 wasn't in the original mixture. Hmm.\n\nTube 3 (red hot Cu) gains 0.80g. Since it forms CuO, that implies that oxygen was present in the gas mixture. The copper is initially in a red-hot state (maybe as Cu metal?), and the O comes from the gas.
