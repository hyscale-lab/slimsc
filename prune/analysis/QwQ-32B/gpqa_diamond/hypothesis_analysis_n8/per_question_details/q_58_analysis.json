So QCD still needs regularization, so B is not the answer.\n\nOption A is Superstring Theory. From what I know, string theory is a candidate for a theory of quantum gravity, and it's supposed to be a UV-complete theory. In string theory, the fundamental objects are strings instead of point particles. Since strings have an extended structure, interactions at very high energies (small distance scales) don't lead to the same kinds of divergences as in point particle theories. Because when particles get very close, in string theory, the interaction is between strings which have a minimum size, so the divergence is avoided. Therefore, string theory might not require regularization in the same way that quantum field theories do. So Superstring Theory might not need regularization at high energies.",

The question is which of these theories never requires regularization at high energy. So, if the question is about quantum field theories, then the answer would be the one that's a quantum theory but doesn't require it. But if a classical theory is an option, then since classical doesn't have those divergences, maybe D is correct. But I thought the question was about quantum theories? Let me read again.\n\nThe question says \"never requires regularization at high energies\". Regularization is needed in quantum field theories (like QED, QCD) because of loops leading to divergences. Classical theories don't have those divergences. So the answer would be D?",
