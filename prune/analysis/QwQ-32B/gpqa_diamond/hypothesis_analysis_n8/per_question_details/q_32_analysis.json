But maybe for such high energies, the electron mass is negligible? Or maybe the problem expects using the atomic mass? Hmm, not sure. Let me see. Let's proceed with the atomic mass first and see if that works. Let me check the standard Li-6 mass. \n\nLooking up in my memory, Li-6 has an atomic mass of about 6.0151228 u. Let me confirm that. Okay. So each atomic mass unit is approximately 931.5 MeV/c\u00b2. So converting the mass to energy units. \n\nBut first, the nucleus is moving at 0.96c. To find the energy, I need to compute the relativistic energy. The total energy of a relativistic particle is gamma times the rest mass energy. \n\nThe formula is: E = \u03b3mc\u00b2, where \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). \n\nSo first, compute gamma. The velocity is 0.96c, so v/c =0.96. \n\nSo (v/c)^2 = 0.9216. \n\nThus, 1 - (v/c)^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. \n\nSquare root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. \n\nSo gamma is 1 / 0.28 \u2248 3.57142857... Approximately 3.5714.",

The mass of the nucleus would be approximately the mass number times the mass of a nucleon. But the exact mass might be necessary for precision here, given that the answer requires 1e-4 precision. Hmm, but maybe the problem expects using the rest mass multiplied by the relativistic energy formula. Let me see.\n\nThe energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = \u03b3mc\u00b2, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). The speed v is given as 0.96c. Let's compute \u03b3 first.\n\nCalculating \u03b3:\nv = 0.96c, so v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216\n1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784\nsqrt(0.0784) = let's see, sqrt(0.0784). Well, sqrt(0.09) is 0.3, sqrt(0.0625) is 0.25. 0.0784 is between those. Let me calculate exactly: 0.28 squared is 0.0784? 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. Oh yes! So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. Therefore, \u03b3 is 1 / 0.28 \u2248 3.57142857...\n\nSo \u03b3 \u2248 3.5714.\n\nNow, I need to compute the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Let's recall the atomic mass of Li-6. The standard atomic weight of lithium is around 6.94, but that's for the naturally occurring mix. But Li-6 has an exact mass.

          "text2": "Wait, the problem states \"the nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons.\" The nucleus is Li-6, but the mass of the nucleus would be slightly less than the atomic mass because the atomic mass includes the electrons' mass. The electrons contribute a small amount. But in the atomic mass, the electrons are included, so if we use the atomic mass, then the rest mass is already including electrons. But when considering the nucleus's rest mass, we need to subtract the electrons' mass. Since Lithium has an atomic number of 3, the nucleus has 3 protons, so there are 3 electrons in the atom. \n\nEach electron mass is about 0.00054858 u.

          "text2": "Wait, the problem states \"the nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons.\" The nucleus is Li-6, but the mass of the nucleus would be slightly less than the atomic mass because the atomic mass includes the electrons' mass. The electrons contribute a small amount. But in the atomic mass, the electrons are included, so if we use the atomic mass, then the rest mass is already including electrons. But when considering the nucleus's rest mass, we need to subtract the electrons' mass. Since Lithium has an atomic number of 3, the nucleus has 3 protons, so there are 3 electrons in the atom. \n\nEach electron mass is about 0.00054858 u. So total for 3 electrons is 3 *0.00054858 \u22480.0016457 u. \n\nTherefore, the nucleus mass would be atomic mass minus electron contribution. So 6.0151227 u (atomic mass of Li-6) minus 0.0016457 u gives 6.013477 u.\n\nSo then, rest mass energy would be 6.013477 * 931.494 MeV/u.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n6.013477 * 931.494 = ?\n\nAgain, 6 * 931.494 =5588.964\n\n0.013477 *931.494 \u22480.01 *931.494 =9.31494, plus 0.003477 *931.494 \u22483.239.\n\nTotal for 0.013477 is approx 9.31494 +3.239 \u224812.5539.\n\nSo total rest mass energy is 5588.964 +12.5539 \u22485601.518 MeV = 5.6015 GeV.\n\nHmm, that's even a bit lower.
