So A is wrong. \n\nOption B: The imaginary parts are \u00b11/2, real parts \u00b11. Again, eigenvalues are real, so imaginary parts can't exist. So B is also incorrect. \n\nOption C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A\u00b2 but not of Az. Hmm. Let's think. \n\nIn quantum mechanics, the square of the angular momentum operator (like A\u00b2 = Ax\u00b2 + Ay\u00b2 + Az\u00b2) commutes with each component (like Ay), so they can have common eigenfunctions. Because [A\u00b2, Ay] =0?",
          "text2": "Wait, eigenvalues here are real numbers. Because S is Hermitian (since it's a Pauli matrix), so Ay must also be Hermitian (since c is real). Hermitian operators have real eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues can't have an imaginary part. So option A is wrong because it mentions imaginary parts. So A can be eliminated.\n\nOption B: The imaginary parts are \u00b11/2, but again eigenvalues are real, so B is incorrect.\n\nOption C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A\u00b2 (which would be the square of the total angular momentum operator), but not of Az. Hmm. In quantum mechanics, the eigenstates of Ay are not eigenstates of Az or Ax, except for the special case. But since the operators Ay and Az don't commute (they are components of angular momentum), their eigenstates can't be simultaneous unless for certain cases. However, the square of the angular momentum operator, like A\u00b2, does commute with each component (since A\u00b2 commutes with any component because [A\u00b2, A_y] = 0 generally).",
