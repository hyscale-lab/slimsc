But when they form dimers, some dimers are wild-type + wild-type (functional?), but others are wild-type + mutant (non-functional), and mutant + mutant (maybe non-functional).

Let me think. Suppose the dimerization domain is required for the protein to pair with another. If the mutant can't form dimers, then the wild-type can't pair with the mutant, so the wild-type proteins might not be able to form enough functional dimers. But if the mutant can still bind, but the dimer is non-functional, that's a classic dominant-negative. So for example, if the mutation in dimerization makes the mutant subunit bind to the wild-type, but the resulting dimer can't activate transcription.

The question is which option matches that. \n\nLooking at option B: protein degradation of wild-type. I don't think the mutation would cause the wild-type to be degraded. Unless the mutant somehow leads to that. But dominant-negative is more about the mutant interacting and blocking, not degrading. \n\nOption D says protein aggregation. Maybe the mutant forms aggregates that include the wild-type, so both are trapped and can't function. That's a possible mechanism.
