Assuming that the reaction is at equilibrium, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. The formation constant K is 5e10. The formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the reaction going forward. So the reverse reaction (dissociation) would have a K_reverse = 1/(5e10). \n\nSo the dissociation reaction is CaY^2- \u21cc Ca^2+ + Y^4-. The K for this reverse reaction is K_reverse = [Ca^2+][Y^4-]/[CaY^2-] = 1/(5e10).\n\nLet\u2019s let the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ be x. Then, since the EDTA and Ca are in a 1:1 ratio, the free Y^4- would also be x. The concentration of the complex is given as 0.02 M, so substituting into the reverse K expression:\n\nK_rev = (x)(x)/(0.02) = 1/(5e10).\n\nTherefore, x\u00b2 = (0.02) / (5e10) \u2192 x\u00b2 = 0.02/(5e10) = (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5)*1e-12 = 0.4e-12 \u2192 x = sqrt(0.4e-12) \u2248 sqrt(0.4)*1e-6. \n\nsqrt(0.4) is sqrt(2/5) \u2248 0.632, so 0.632e-6 = 6.32e-7 M. That's exactly option C, 6.3x10^-7 M. So the answer should be C.",
          "text2": "Wait, maybe that's a better way to think. Because the question states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So perhaps the starting point is that the complex is present at 0.02 M, and it can dissociate into Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA\u2074\u207b. In that case, the equilibrium is:\n\nCaY\u00b2\u207b \u21cc Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA\u2074\u207b \n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation would be 1/(K_Ca-EDTA) because the original K was for the formation of the complex. Since K_form = [CaY\u00b2\u207b]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA\u2074\u207b]) = 5e10, then the reverse reaction's K is 1/(5e10).\n\nSo, if the initial concentration of CaY\u00b2\u207b is 0.02 M, then let's let x be the concentration that dissociates. So at equilibrium:\n\n[CaY\u00b2\u207b] = 0.02 - x\n\n[Ca\u00b2+] = x\n\n[EDTA\u2074\u207b] = x\n\nThe equilibrium expression for the dissociation is:\n\nK_dissoc = [Ca\u00b2+][EDTA\u2074\u207b]/[CaY\u00b2\u207b] = (x)(x)/(0.02 - x) = x\u00b2/(0.02 - x) = 1/(5e10)\n\nSince K_dissoc is so small (1e-10 or so?), the x will be very small compared to 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02. Then:\n\nx\u00b2 \u2248 (1/(5e10)) * 0.02 \n\nx\u00b2 \u2248 (0.02)/(5e10) = (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2)/(5e12) = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13\n\nTaking square root gives x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5?",

But assuming that the formation constant is very large (since K is 5e10, which is a huge number), then the complex should be mostly formed, so the free Ca\u00b2+ is very low. But how exactly do I compute it?\n\nLet me think in terms of the formation constant. The formation constant K is [CaEDTA\u00b2\u207b]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA\u2074\u207b]). Since the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the complex, so [CaEDTA\u00b2\u207b] = 0.02 M. But we can assume that the concentration of free EDTA is approximately equal to the free Ca\u00b2+ because the complex is 1:1. So, if the EDTA and Ca were in stoichiometric amounts, then the EDTA that's free would be the same as the Ca\u00b2+ that's free. Let me denote [Ca\u00b2+] = x, then [EDTA\u2074\u207b] is also approximately x. \n\nSo plugging into K: \n\nK = (0.02) / (x * x) = 5e10.\n\nTherefore, solving for x\u00b2 = 0.02 / (5e10) \n\nx\u00b2 = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5)*1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13 \n\nTaking square root: x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5?",

Since Kf is so large, the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ should be very small. Let me think about how to set up the equation.\n\nLet me denote the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ as x. The EDTA will also have some free concentration, but since the complex is 1:1, the free EDTA concentration should also be x, assuming that the dissociation of the complex produces equal amounts of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4-.\n\nSo, the formation constant expression is Kf = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA]). Let's plug in the numbers. The concentration of the complex would be 0.02 - x, but since Kf is so large, x is going to be very small. So maybe we can approximate [Ca-EDTA] as approximately 0.02 M. Then, [Ca\u00b2+] = [EDTA] = x.\n\nSo the equation becomes Kf = (0.02) / (x^2). Solving for x would give the square root of (0.02 / Kf). Let me compute that. \n\nPlugging in the numbers: 0.02 divided by 5e10. Let's see: 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5)*1e-12 = 0.4e-12, which is 4e-13.
