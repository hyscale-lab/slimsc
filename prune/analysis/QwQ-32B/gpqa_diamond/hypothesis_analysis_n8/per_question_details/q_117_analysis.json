The nitro group is on position 6, which is meta to position 2. Similarly for the other ring. The key is whether this molecule has a chiral center.

So 4 is out.\n\nNow back to compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Let me try to visualize this. The biphenyl is two benzene rings connected by a single bond at positions 1 and 1'. The nitro groups (NO2) are on the 6th position of each ring. The carboxylate groups are on the 2nd and 2' positions (so each ring has a carboxylate at position 2). The molecule is esterified with methyl groups, so each carboxylate is replaced by OMe. \n\nNow, the key is to check if there's a chiral center here. The biphenyl structure's connectivity: the two rings are connected at 1-1', so each ring's numbering would be such that 1 is the point of connection. The 2nd position on each ring is adjacent to the connecting carbon. Let me think of the biphenyl structure. The two rings are connected via a single bond, so rotation is possible, but in the case of isomerism, we're considering the structure in its most stable form. However, for chirality, the molecule must have a center that can't be superimposed on its mirror image.\n\nThe nitro groups are on the 6th and 6' positions. Let me imagine the biphenyl as two benzene rings. The 6th carbon on each ring is opposite to the connecting carbon (since in a benzene ring, the positions are numbered such that 1 is the connecting point, then 2 is next, 3, etc. The 6th would be three carbons away from the connection. So the nitro groups are on the positions opposite to the point where the two rings are connected. \n\nThe carboxylate groups (as esters) are on the 2nd and 2' positions. Each ring's 2nd carbon is adjacent to the connecting carbon (position 1). So the methyl ester groups are attached to the 2nd carbons of each ring. \n\nNow, does this molecule have any chiral centers? Let's look at each carbon. The biphenyl itself has the two rings connected via a single bond. The central carbon-carbon bond (between the two rings) can rotate, but that's not a chiral center. The nitro groups are on symmetric positions. The ester groups on 2 and 2' are also symmetric. So the entire molecule is symmetric with respect to the plane that bisects the biphenyl's connecting bond. Therefore, any chiral centers would have their mirror images present in the molecule. Hence, the molecule itself would be meso if there were chiral centers. But are there any chiral centers here?\n\nLooking at each carbon in the molecule: \n\nThe nitro groups are on the 6th and 6' carbons. Each of those carbons has two nitro groups (but wait, each 6th carbon is part of the benzene ring. Each ring's 6th carbon is attached to the nitro group and three other carbons (since it's part of the benzene ring).",

In biphenyls, the numbering usually starts on one ring, then continues on the other.

So the 6 position on the first ring is opposite to the connection point (position 1), and similarly for the second ring. The 6' would be the same on the other ring. If both nitro groups are on the 6 positions, then they are on the same relative position on each ring. The ester groups are on the 2 and 2' positions. The 2 positions are adjacent to the connection point (since position 1 is the connection between the two rings). So the 2 position on each ring would be next to the central bond.

Let me number the benzene rings. Let's say the first ring (left) has the 1 position where it connects to the other ring. Then positions 2,3,4,5,6. The 6 position on each ring is opposite to the 2 position. So the nitro groups are on the 6 and 6', which are opposite to the 2 positions. The carboxylates are on 2 and 2', so each ring has a nitro on the 6 and a carboxylate on 2. Since the nitro and carboxylate on each ring are in different positions, but the arrangement on both rings would mirror each other. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it would not be chiral. For example, if the structure is symmetric across the plane through the central bond, then it's meso.

Let me re-examine it again.\n\nCompound1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. \n\nThe structure has two benzene rings connected at 1-1'. The nitro groups are on the 6th positions (each ring's 6th carbon). The carboxylate groups are on 2 and 2' (each ring's second carbon). \n\nThe molecule's symmetry: the two rings are connected at 1-1', so the entire molecule is symmetric along the axis connecting the two rings. The nitro groups on 6 and6' are symmetric. The ester groups on 2 and2' are also symmetric. So the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry through the connecting carbon and the nitro/ester groups. \n\nHowever, perhaps there's a chiral center in one of the rings. Let me look at each carbon in the molecule. Take the 2' carbon (on the second ring). It has an ester group (OCH3), two adjacent carbons in the ring, and the rest are ring bonds. The substituents on that carbon are OCH3 and the ring's other groups. Since the ring is symmetric, the substituents on either side are the same. Hence, no chiral center. Similarly for the other substituents. \n\nTherefore, compound1 has no chiral centers. \n\nSo the only correct option is 2. But none of the options have only 2.",
          "text2": "Wait, but wait. Let me check again. If the molecule has a chiral center, then yes. But in this case, the carbons in the double bond are sp2 hybridized, so they can't be chiral centers. The carbonyl carbons (the ones in the COO groups) are also sp2. So no chiral centers here. So no, option 4 is out.\n\nSo now, going back to the first compound: 1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.\n\nLet me try to figure out if there are any chiral centers here. The molecule has a biphenyl structure with nitro groups on the 6 and 6' positions, and carboxylate groups on the 2 and 2' positions. Each carboxylate is esterified with a methyl group. The biphenyl is connected at the 1-1' position. Let me think about the positions. Let's imagine each benzene ring. On the first ring (left), the 1 position is where it's connected to the other benzene. The 2 position is adjacent to 1, so it's on the same side. The 6 position is opposite to 2. Similarly for the other ring. So the nitro groups are on the 6 positions (opposite side of the 2 positions). The carboxylate groups are on 2 and 2', which are on the same side of each ring. Since the molecule is symmetric, each ring has the same substituents in positions 2 and 6. Therefore, the entire molecule is symmetric across the plane that includes the central bond between the two benzene rings. This means that any mirror image would be superimposable by rotating the molecule, so it has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, there are no chiral centers, and the molecule is meso, so it does not have optical isomerism. So option 1 is out.\n\nSo the compounds that do show optical isomerism are number 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate), which has a chiral center, and maybe number 4?",
