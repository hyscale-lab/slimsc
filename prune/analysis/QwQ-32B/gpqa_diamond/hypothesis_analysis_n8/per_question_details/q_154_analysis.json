The carbonyl at 1720 is a bit more towards the lower end; carboxylic acids typically have around 2500-1750 (but maybe 1720 is possible for esters or other groups). Hmm, maybe I should note that the IR suggests either an acid or an ester. The broad O-H would point more towards carboxylic acid.\n\nMoving on to the \u00b9H NMR data. There's a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which is a very high field for a proton.

That's way higher than 156, so this can't be. So option C is out because the mass doesn't match. The given options might have a typo, but according to the problem, C's mass would be too high. So eliminate C.\n\nOption D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure: same as B but the Cl is at position 2. Molecular formula is the same as B: C7H5ClO2 (since it's just positional isomer). So molecular weight would also be 156.5, which matches the given 156. So both B and D have the same molecular weight. So the mass can't distinguish between B and D. But other data must help.\n\nNow, looking back at the NMR data. The NMR shows:\n\n- 11.0 ppm (s, 1H): likely the COOH proton (as in B or D), but carboxylic acids typically have their O-H around 10-12 ppm, so that's okay.",

Total is 84+5=89 +32=121 +35.5=156.5. So that also gives molecular weight ~156.5. So mass matches. The IR would have a carbonyl (the ester-like C=O from the chloroformate group), which would be around 1720 (matches the given 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9). The O-H in chloroformate? No, chloroformate is O-C(O)-Cl, so there's no O-H. The broad peak in the IR (3500-2700) would be from an O-H, so that would conflict with chloroformate not having an O-H.
