To separate variables, each term must depend only on r or only on \u03b8. However, since V includes a term with cos\u00b2\u03b8 multiplied by r\u00b2, which is a function of both variables, this complicates the separation. \n\nHmm, so maybe my initial approach of converting to Cartesian coordinates is better. Let me go back to that.\n\nIn Cartesian coordinates, the problem is an anisotropic harmonic oscillator with V(x, y) = 2k x\u00b2 + (k/2)y\u00b2. So in this case, the energy levels would be the sum of the x and y oscillators. Since each direction is independent, their energies add up.\n\nThe x-direction oscillator has k_x = 2k, so its frequency \u03c9_x = sqrt(k_x/m) = sqrt(2k/m). The energy levels for x are (n_x + 1/2) \u210f \u03c9_x.\n\nSimilarly, y-direction has k_y = (k/2), so \u03c9_y = sqrt(k_y/m) = sqrt( (k/2)/m ) = sqrt(k/(2m)). The energy levels for y are (n_y + 1/2) \u210f \u03c9_y.\n\nThe total energy is the sum of these two. So,\n\nE = (n_x + 1/2) \u210f sqrt(2k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) \u210f sqrt(k/(2m)) \n\nLet me factor out \u210f sqrt(k/m):\n\nsqrt(2k/m) = sqrt(2) * sqrt(k/m), and sqrt(k/(2m)) = (1/sqrt(2)) sqrt(k/m). \n\nSo E becomes:\n\nE = \u210f sqrt(k/m) [ (n_x + 1/2) sqrt(2) + (n_y + 1/2) / sqrt(2) ]\n\nLet me compute the terms inside the brackets. Let me write sqrt(2) as \u221a2 and 1/sqrt(2) as 1/\u221a2.\n\nSo:\n\nE = \u210f sqrt(k/m) [ \u221a2 n_x + (\u221a2)/2 + (n_y)/\u221a2 + (1/(2\u221a2)) ]",

To separate variables, each term must depend only on r or only on \u03b8. However, since V includes a term with cos\u00b2\u03b8 multiplied by r\u00b2, which is a function of both variables, this complicates the separation. \n\nHmm, so maybe my initial approach of converting to Cartesian coordinates is better. Let me go back to that.\n\nIn Cartesian coordinates, the problem is an anisotropic harmonic oscillator with V(x, y) = 2k x\u00b2 + (k/2)y\u00b2. So in this case, the energy levels would be the sum of the x and y oscillators. Since each direction is independent, their energies add up.\n\nThe x-direction oscillator has k_x = 2k, so its frequency \u03c9_x = sqrt(k_x/m) = sqrt(2k/m). The energy levels for x are (n_x + 1/2) \u210f \u03c9_x.\n\nSimilarly, y-direction has k_y = (k/2), so \u03c9_y = sqrt(k_y/m) = sqrt( (k/2)/m ) = sqrt(k/(2m)). The energy levels for y are (n_y + 1/2) \u210f \u03c9_y.\n\nThe total energy is the sum of these two. So,\n\nE = (n_x + 1/2) \u210f sqrt(2k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) \u210f sqrt(k/(2m)) \n\nLet me factor out \u210f sqrt(k/m):\n\nsqrt(2k/m) = sqrt(2) * sqrt(k/m), and sqrt(k/(2m)) = (1/sqrt(2)) sqrt(k/m). \n\nSo E becomes:\n\nE = \u210f sqrt(k/m) [ (n_x + 1/2) sqrt(2) + (n_y + 1/2) / sqrt(2) ]\n\nLet me compute the terms inside the brackets. Let me write sqrt(2) as \u221a2 and 1/sqrt(2) as 1/\u221a2.\n\nSo:\n\nE = \u210f sqrt(k/m) [ \u221a2 n_x + (\u221a2)/2 + (n_y)/\u221a2 + (1/(2\u221a2)) ]",
          "text2": "Alternatively, since it's in polar coordinates, perhaps we can separate variables into r and \u03b8.

Let's assume a solution of the form \u03c8(r,\u03b8) = R(r)\u0398(\u03b8).

So that term is (3/2)kr\u00b2*(x\u00b2/r\u00b2) = (3/2)k x\u00b2. Oh, that's a good simplification! So the total potential is:\n\nV(x, y) = (1/2)k(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + (3/2)k x\u00b2 = (1/2 k x\u00b2 + 1/2 k y\u00b2) + 3/2 k x\u00b2 = [ (1/2 + 3/2)k x\u00b2 ] + (1/2 k y\u00b2) = 2k x\u00b2 + (k/2)y\u00b2.\n\nAh! So that's a big simplification. Therefore, the potential in Cartesian coordinates is V(x,y) = 2k x\u00b2 + (k/2)y\u00b2. That makes things much clearer. So now the potential is a harmonic oscillator in x and y directions, but with different spring constants. So this is an anisotropic harmonic oscillator in two dimensions.\n\nThe energy levels of a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the sum of the energies of each direction. The general form for each direction is (n_x + 1/2) hbar sqrt(k_x/m) + (n_y + 1/2) hbar sqrt(k_y/m), where k_x and k_y are the spring constants in x and y directions respectively.\n\nIn this case, the potential in the x-direction is V_x = 2k x\u00b2, so the spring constant k_x is 2k. Similarly, the y-direction potential is V_y = (k/2)y\u00b2, so the spring constant k_y is k/2.\n\nTherefore, the energy for the x-component is (n_x + 1/2) hbar sqrt( (2k)/m )\n\nThe energy for the y-component is (n_y + 1/2) hbar sqrt( (k/2)/m )\n\nTherefore total energy E = [ (n_x + 1/2) sqrt(2k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) sqrt(k/(2m)) ] * \u210f\n\nHmm, but the answer options are given in terms of coefficients multiplied by n_x and n_y, plus constants, all multiplied by \u210f sqrt(k/m). So perhaps we can factor out sqrt(k/m) from the terms?\n\nLet me see:\n\nFirst, let's write each term:\n\nsqrt(2k/m) = sqrt(2) * sqrt(k/m)\n\nsqrt(k/(2m)) = (1/sqrt(2)) sqrt(k/m)\n\nTherefore, substituting back into E:\n\nE = \u210f sqrt(k/m) [ (n_x + 1/2) sqrt(2) + (n_y + 1/2) (1/sqrt(2)) ) ]\n\nHmm, but the options don't have square roots in the coefficients, so maybe there's another way to combine these terms?",

Since r\u00b2 is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2, and cos\u03b8 is x/r, so cos\u00b2\u03b8 is x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). So substituting that in, the second term becomes (3/2)k (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) * (x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)) = (3/2)k x\u00b2. Oh, right! That's right. So the entire potential V(r,\u03b8) in Cartesian coordinates is (1/2)k(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + (3/2)k x\u00b2. \n\nAdding those terms together, the total potential would be (1/2k x\u00b2 + 1/2k y\u00b2) + (3/2k x\u00b2). The x terms add up: 1/2k x\u00b2 + 3/2k x\u00b2 = 2k x\u00b2. And then the y term is still 1/2k y\u00b2. So the potential simplifies to V(x,y) = 2k x\u00b2 + (1/2)k y\u00b2. \n\nSo now the problem is a 2D potential where the x direction has a harmonic oscillator with spring constant 2k, and the y direction has a harmonic oscillator with spring constant (1/2)k? Or wait, the standard harmonic oscillator potential is (1/2)k x\u00b2, so here the x term is 2k x\u00b2, so that would correspond to a spring constant of 4k?",

So that term is (3/2)kr\u00b2*(x\u00b2/r\u00b2) = (3/2)k x\u00b2. Oh, that's a good simplification! So the total potential is:\n\nV(x, y) = (1/2)k(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + (3/2)k x\u00b2 = (1/2 k x\u00b2 + 1/2 k y\u00b2) + 3/2 k x\u00b2 = [ (1/2 + 3/2)k x\u00b2 ] + (1/2 k y\u00b2) = 2k x\u00b2 + (k/2)y\u00b2.\n\nAh! So that's a big simplification. Therefore, the potential in Cartesian coordinates is V(x,y) = 2k x\u00b2 + (k/2)y\u00b2. That makes things much clearer. So now the potential is a harmonic oscillator in x and y directions, but with different spring constants. So this is an anisotropic harmonic oscillator in two dimensions.\n\nThe energy levels of a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the sum of the energies of each direction. The general form for each direction is (n_x + 1/2) hbar sqrt(k_x/m) + (n_y + 1/2) hbar sqrt(k_y/m), where k_x and k_y are the spring constants in x and y directions respectively.\n\nIn this case, the potential in the x-direction is V_x = 2k x\u00b2, so the spring constant k_x is 2k. Similarly, the y-direction potential is V_y = (k/2)y\u00b2, so the spring constant k_y is k/2.\n\nTherefore, the energy for the x-component is (n_x + 1/2) hbar sqrt( (2k)/m )\n\nThe energy for the y-component is (n_y + 1/2) hbar sqrt( (k/2)/m )\n\nTherefore total energy E = [ (n_x + 1/2) sqrt(2k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) sqrt(k/(2m)) ] * \u210f\n\nHmm, but the answer options are given in terms of coefficients multiplied by n_x and n_y, plus constants, all multiplied by \u210f sqrt(k/m).

Since r\u00b2 is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2, and cos\u03b8 is x/r, so cos\u00b2\u03b8 is x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). So substituting that in, the second term becomes (3/2)k (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) * (x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)) = (3/2)k x\u00b2. Oh, right! That's right. So the entire potential V(r,\u03b8) in Cartesian coordinates is (1/2)k(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + (3/2)k x\u00b2. \n\nAdding those terms together, the total potential would be (1/2k x\u00b2 + 1/2k y\u00b2) + (3/2k x\u00b2). The x terms add up: 1/2k x\u00b2 + 3/2k x\u00b2 = 2k x\u00b2. And then the y term is still 1/2k y\u00b2. So the potential simplifies to V(x,y) = 2k x\u00b2 + (1/2)k y\u00b2. \n\nSo now the problem is a 2D potential where the x direction has a harmonic oscillator with spring constant 2k, and the y direction has a harmonic oscillator with spring constant (1/2)k? Or wait, the standard harmonic oscillator potential is (1/2)k x\u00b2, so here the x term is 2k x\u00b2, so that would correspond to a spring constant of 4k?",

Since each direction is independent, their energies add up.\n\nThe x-direction oscillator has k_x = 2k, so its frequency \u03c9_x = sqrt(k_x/m) = sqrt(2k/m). The energy levels for x are (n_x + 1/2) \u210f \u03c9_x.\n\nSimilarly, y-direction has k_y = (k/2), so \u03c9_y = sqrt(k_y/m) = sqrt( (k/2)/m ) = sqrt(k/(2m)).
