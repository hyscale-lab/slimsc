So here, mutant1's fourth codon is Arg instead of Ala.\n\nSo this is an amino acid change from Ala to Arg. That's a missense mutation, but not a stop. So the protein would have an Arg instead of Ala here, which might affect function but may not completely eliminate the compound. Unless the enzyme is inactivated by that change, but it's not clear. So this mutation may or may not be effective. \n\nNow, looking at the options, we need to find the mutation that would most likely eliminate the compound. So maybe a nonsense mutation (premature stop) or a frameshift.\n\nLooking at Mutant2:\n\nMutant2's sequence: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019",

So GCT is still there. So that's alanine.\n\nSo in mutant1, the first change that affects the codon is at position7-9 (the second codon after the start), where CTC becomes TAC. That's a missense mutation. But the gene is still producing the protein, just with a different amino acid.

So here, mutant1's fourth codon is Arg instead of Ala.\n\nSo this is an amino acid change from Ala to Arg. That's a missense mutation, but not a stop. So the protein would have an Arg instead of Ala here, which might affect function but may not completely eliminate the compound. Unless the enzyme is inactivated by that change, but it's not clear. So this mutation may or may not be effective. \n\nNow, looking at the options, we need to find the mutation that would most likely eliminate the compound. So maybe a nonsense mutation (premature stop) or a frameshift.\n\nLooking at Mutant2:\n\nMutant2's sequence: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019",

So GCT is still there. So that's alanine.\n\nSo in mutant1, the first change that affects the codon is at position7-9 (the second codon after the start), where CTC becomes TAC. That's a missense mutation. But the gene is still producing the protein, just with a different amino acid.

That's a missense mutation. But the gene is still producing the protein, just with a different amino acid. So unless that change disrupts the function, maybe it's not enough to eliminate the compound. But since the question is about eliminating the compound, perhaps the gene needs to be non-functional.
