The impulse approximation is often used in such contexts. The assumption that the quarks are non-relativistic might be part of another approximation, like the non-relativistic treatment of the nucleons themselves. But the impulse approximation is more about the interaction with a single nucleon and ignoring other nucleons' effects, not the internal structure. So maybe assumption 3 is not required here.",

The quarks being non-relativistic might be part of another approximation, like the static approximation for the nucleon's internal structure. The impulse approximation is about treating the nucleons as free in the nucleus, not necessarily their internal structure. So the key points are that the interaction is only with one nucleon (1), other nucleons don't matter (2), and that the nucleon isn't bound (4). So I think the correct answer is A.",
