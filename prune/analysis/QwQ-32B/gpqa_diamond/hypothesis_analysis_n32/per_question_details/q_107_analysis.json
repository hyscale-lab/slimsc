Since the molecule has multiple chiral centers and tautomers, there could be a lot of possible conformations. Docking all of them would be computationally expensive.

Quantum calculations can be accurate but time-consuming. But if there are multiple chiral centers, there are multiple possible enantiomers. Choosing just the most stable one might miss other forms that could bind better, even if they're less stable. Also, quantum calculations might not account for tautomeric forms as easily?\n\nSo, the problem is that the molecule has multiple chiral centers (so multiple stereoisomers) and tautomers. The key here is that for docking, you need to know which structural forms of the molecule are likely to be present in the biological system.

So before doing docking, you need to generate the possible relevant structures. \n\nOption B talks about analyzing all but prioritizing based on physicochemical properties. That way, they don't have to dock every possible form. Instead, they pick the ones that are more likely to be active (maybe based on things like pKa, solubility, stability, etc.). That seems crucial because otherwise, the docking could be too broad or ineffective.\n\nOption D might be too narrow, because maybe the most stable form isn't the one that binds.
