So the normalized eigenvector would be (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2) since the norm squared is 1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 = 2.\n\nTherefore the eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2).",

So the equations are consistent, so for \u03bb=1, the eigenvector can be written in terms of y. Let me pick y = \u221a2, then x = (1/\u221a2)(\u221a2) =1, z= (1/\u221a2)(\u221a2)=1. So the eigenvector is (1, \u221a2, 1). But need to normalize it. The norm squared is 1\u00b2 + (\u221a2)^2 +1\u00b2 = 1+2+1=4. So norm is 2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/2, \u221a2/2, 1/2).\n\nHmm, okay. Let me see for \u03bb = -1. Let's test that. Then P + I:\n\n[1, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n\n[1/\u221a2, 1, 1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 1 ]\n\nSo equations:\n\nx + (1/\u221a2)y =0,\n\n(1/\u221a2)x + y + (1/\u221a2)z=0,\n\n(1/\u221a2)y + z =0.\n\nLet me see. Let me take the first equation: x = - (1/\u221a2)y.\n\nThird equation: z = - (1/\u221a2)y.\n\nSubstituting into second equation:\n\n(1/\u221a2)(- (1/\u221a2)y ) + y + (1/\u221a2)( - (1/\u221a2)y )\n\n= (- (1/2)y ) + y - (1/2)y = ( -1/2 +1 -1/2 ) y = 0. \n\nSo yes, consistent. Let's choose y = \u221a2 again. Then x is -1, z is -1. So eigenvector (-1, \u221a2, -1). Norm squared: 1 +2 +1=4 again. So normalized eigenvector (-1/2, \u221a2/2, -1/2).\n\nNow, for \u03bb =0, the remaining eigenvalue. Since trace is zero, the sum is 1 + (-1) +0 =0, so that's correct. So the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0. So the eigenvalues for P are 1,0,-1. \n\nWe need the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Let me find that. For \u03bb=0, the matrix P becomes:\n\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n\n[1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n\nSo equations:\n\n(1/\u221a2)y =0 \u2192 y=0,\n\n(1/\u221a2)x + (1/\u221a2) z =0,\n\nSimilarly, third equation (from third row) gives (1/\u221a2)y =0 which is same as first equation. So y must be 0. Then the second equation: x + z =0 (since multiplying both terms by \u221a2 gives x + z =0). \n\nSo variables x and z must satisfy x = -z, and y=0. Let me choose variables. Let me set z = t, then x = -t, and y=0. So eigenvectors are of the form (-t, 0, t). Let's choose t =1, so vector (-1,0,1). The norm squared is (-1)^2 +0 +1^2 =2, so norm is sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (-1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2). \n\nSo the eigenvalues of P are 1, 0, -1, with corresponding normalized eigenvectors:\n\nFor 1: (1/2, \u221a2/2, 1/2),\n\nFor 0: (-1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2),\n\nFor -1: (-1/2, \u221a2/2, -1/2).",

The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries: 1, 0, -1. \n\nThe eigenvectors for eigenvalue -1 are the vectors where the third component is non-zero and others are zero? Let me see.\n\nThe equation Qv = \u03bb v. For \u03bb = -1:\n\n(Q + I)v =0 \u2192 (since Q - (-1)I = Q + I):\n\nThe matrix Q + I is:\n\n[1+1, 0, 0 \u2192 2, 0,0]\n\n[0, 0+1,0 \u2192 0,1,0]\n\n[0,0,-1+1 \u21920,0,0]\n\nSo the equation (Q + I)v =0 requires:\n\nFirst row: 2v1 +0 +0 =0 \u2192 v1 =0\n\nSecond row:0*v1 +1*v2 +0=0 \u2192 v2=0\n\nThird row:0*v1 +0*v2 +0*v3=0 \u2192 no condition on v3. \n\nThus the eigenvectors for eigenvalue -1 are vectors with v1=0, v2=0, v3 arbitrary. So the eigenvectors are scalar multiples of (0,0,1). The normalized eigenvector is (0,0,1).\n\nTherefore, the eigenstate for Q with eigenvalue -1 is (0,0,1).",
          "text2": "Wait, so that's the probability of measuring 0 for P first? So that would be 1/3. Okay, so that's the first part. \n\nNow, assuming that the first measurement of P yields 0, the system collapses into the eigenstate v_normalized. So the new state after measurement is v_normalized, which is (1/\u221a2)(1,0,-1)^T.\n\nThen, we perform a measurement of Q. The question is, what is the probability of getting -1 in the Q measurement? \n\nSo, we need to compute the probability that the state (after P measurement) is in an eigenstate of Q with eigenvalue -1. \n\nSo first, let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Q. The matrix Q is given as:\n\nFirst row (1,0,0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-1). \n\nSo Q is a diagonal matrix with entries 1, 0, -1. So the eigenvalues are the diagonal entries: 1,0,-1.\n\nThe eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The eigenvalue 1 corresponds to (1,0,0)^T, eigenvalue 0 to (0,1,0)^T, and eigenvalue -1 to (0,0,1)^T.\n\nTherefore, to get eigenvalue -1, the eigenstate is the vector e3 = (0,0,1)^T, normalized to itself.\n\nSo, the probability of measuring Q=-1 when the system is in the state v_normalized (after P measurement) is the squared absolute value of the inner product between v_normalized and e3_normalized (which is e3 itself, since it's already normalized).\n\nSo compute \u27e8v_normalized | e3\u27e9:\n\nv_normalized is (1/\u221a2)(1, 0, -1)^T. \n\nThe inner product with e3 (0,0,1) is (1/\u221a2)(1*0 +0*0 + (-1)*1) = (1/\u221a2)(-1). The absolute value squared is (1)^2 / 2 = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting Q=-1 after collapsing to the eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0 is 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the total probability is the product of the two probabilities: (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6. \n\nLooking at the options, D is 1/6.

So the eigenvector is (1, \u221a2, 1). But need to normalize it. The norm squared is 1\u00b2 + (\u221a2)^2 +1\u00b2 = 1+2+1=4. So norm is 2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/2, \u221a2/2, 1/2).\n\nHmm, okay. Let me see for \u03bb = -1. Let's test that.

Let's choose y = \u221a2 again. Then x is -1, z is -1. So eigenvector (-1, \u221a2, -1). Norm squared: 1 +2 +1=4 again. So normalized eigenvector (-1/2, \u221a2/2, -1/2).\n\nNow, for \u03bb =0, the remaining eigenvalue. Since trace is zero, the sum is 1 + (-1) +0 =0, so that's correct. So the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0. So the eigenvalues for P are 1,0,-1. \n\nWe need the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Let me find that. For \u03bb=0, the matrix P becomes:\n\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n\n[1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n\nSo equations:\n\n(1/\u221a2)y =0 \u2192 y=0,\n\n(1/\u221a2)x + (1/\u221a2) z =0,\n\nSimilarly, third equation (from third row) gives (1/\u221a2)y =0 which is same as first equation. So y must be 0. Then the second equation: x + z =0 (since multiplying both terms by \u221a2 gives x + z =0). \n\nSo variables x and z must satisfy x = -z, and y=0. Let me choose variables. Let me set z = t, then x = -t, and y=0. So eigenvectors are of the form (-t, 0, t). Let's choose t =1, so vector (-1,0,1). The norm squared is (-1)^2 +0 +1^2 =2, so norm is sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (-1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2). \n\nSo the eigenvalues of P are 1, 0, -1, with corresponding normalized eigenvectors:\n\nFor 1: (1/2, \u221a2/2, 1/2),\n\nFor 0: (-1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2),\n\nFor -1: (-1/2, \u221a2/2, -1/2).",

Since a is 1/\u221a2 \u22600, so v2=0.\n\nSecond row: a v1 + 0*v2 +a v3 =0 \u2192 (v1 + v3)/\u221a2 =0 \u2192 v1 + v3=0 \u2192 v3 = -v1.\n\nThird row: 0*v1 + a v2 +0*v3 =0 \u2192 same as first equation, so same conclusion v2=0.\n\nThus, eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are vectors of the form [v1;0; -v1], where v1 is any real number (or complex, but assuming real vectors here).\n\nThus, the eigenspace for eigenvalue 0 is one-dimensional (since the equations reduce it to one free variable), spanned by the vector [1;0;-1].",

Therefore, the normalized state is ( -1/\u221a6 , 2/\u221a6 , 1/\u221a6 )^T.\n\nSo when calculating the probability of measuring P=0, we need the inner product between the normalized initial state and the eigenstate of P=0, then squared.",
          "text2": "Wait, but maybe the question assumes that it's normalized. Let me see.\n\nBut the problem says \"the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)\". Since in quantum mechanics, states are normalized, perhaps the actual given vector is a non-normalized vector, so we need to normalize it first. Let me confirm that.\n\nThe norm squared is (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2 =1+4+1=6. So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2,1)^T. So when calculating probabilities, we must use the normalized vector. \n\nSo first, to compute the probability that measuring P gives 0, we need to find the projection of the initial state onto the eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0. Then square the absolute value of that.\n\nThe eigenvector for 0 is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2) as I found earlier. Let's call this vector v0. \n\nThe initial state (normalized) is (1/\u221a6)(-1, 2, 1)^T.\n\nThe inner product between the initial state and v0 is:\n\n(1/\u221a6)(-1, 2, 1) \u2022 (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2)\n\nCompute each component:\n\nFirst component: (-1)(1/\u221a2) * (1/\u221a6) \u2192 (-1)/(\u221a2 * \u221a6) \n\nSecond component: 2*0 =0\n\nThird component: 1*(-1/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a6) \u2192 (-1)/(\u221a2 *\u221a6 )\n\nAdding all components:\n\n[ (-1 -1 )/(\u221a2 * \u221a6) ) ]",
