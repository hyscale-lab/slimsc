So for |\u03b1\u27e9 and |-\u03b1\u27e9, both have \u27e8X\u00b2\u27e9 = 2 \u03b1\u00b2 + 0.5. \n\nThe cross terms \u27e8\u03b1|X\u00b2|-\u03b1\u27e9 can be calculated as follows. Let me note that X is proportional to (a + a\u2020), where a is the annihilation operator. However, since X\u00b2 would involve terms like a\u00b2, (a\u2020)^2, and a a\u2020 + a\u2020 a.",

Let me denote \u03b1 as a complex number, but in the problem, the phase phi might be such that the states are real? Since the phase phi is given as -pi/4, but maybe alpha is a real number here? The problem states \"alpha is the amplitude\"\u2014probably a complex number, but perhaps in this context, it's just a real number. Let me assume alpha is real for simplicity unless stated otherwise. So alpha is real, so |-\u03b1\u27e9 is the coherent state at -alpha.\n\nThe terms \u27e8\u03b1|a|-\u03b1\u27e9: Let's compute a acting on |-\u03b1\u27e9 gives -\u03b1 |-\u03b1\u27e9. Therefore, \u27e8\u03b1|a|-\u03b1\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03b1| (-\u03b1) |-\u03b1\u27e9 = -\u03b1 \u27e8\u03b1|-\u03b1\u27e9. Similarly, \u27e8-\u03b1|a|\u03b1\u27e9 = \u27e8-\u03b1| \u03b1 |\u03b1\u27e9 = \u03b1 \u27e8-\u03b1|\u03b1\u27e9.\n\nSo then, the cross terms become cos(phi) sin(phi)*[-\u03b1 \u27e8\u03b1|-\u03b1\u27e9 + \u03b1 \u27e8-\u03b1|\u03b1\u27e9 ].\n\nBut \u27e8\u03b1|-\u03b1\u27e9 is e^{- (|\u03b1|\u00b2 + | - \u03b1|\u00b2)/2 + \u03b1*(-\u03b1)*} since for coherent states, \u27e8\u03b1|\u03b2\u27e9 = e^{- (|\u03b1|\u00b2 + |\u03b2|\u00b2)/2 + \u03b1\u03b2*}. Since \u03b1 is real, \u03b2 is -\u03b1, so \u03b2* is -\u03b1. Thus, \u27e8\u03b1|-\u03b1\u27e9 = e^{- \u03b1\u00b2 - \u03b1\u00b2/2 + \u03b1*(-\u03b1) }?",

Therefore, Re( <alpha|p |-alpha> ) =0. \n\nTherefore, the cross terms in the expectation of p would vanish, leading to <p> = 0. \n\nNow, compute <p\u00b2> for the cat state. \n\nFollowing the same steps as for x\u00b2, but with p\u00b2. \n\nThe calculation would be similar but with the operator p\u00b2. \n\nHowever, due to the symmetric nature of the problem (since the state is symmetric with respect to x and p when phi is such that displacement is zero), I can assume that Var(p) is the same as Var(x).",

The minimum over Gaussian states tau of this would be the non-Gaussianity. \n\nIf we choose tau as the vacuum state (pure), then S(rho || tau) = - trace(rho ln tau) = - trace(rho ln |0><0| ). The overlap of the cat state with the vacuum is \u27e80|psi\u27e9 = (cos\u03c6 \u27e80|alpha> + sin\u03c6 \u27e80| -alpha>)/N. \n\nCompute this:\n\n\u27e80|alpha> = e^{-\u03b1\u00b2/2}, so:\n\n\u27e80|psi\u27e9 = [ cos\u03c6 e^{-\u03b1\u00b2/2} + sin\u03c6 e^{-\u03b1\u00b2/2} ] / N \n\n= e^{-\u03b1\u00b2/2} [ cos\u03c6 + sin\u03c6 ] / N \n\nWith phi=-pi/4, cos\u03c6 + sin\u03c6 = sqrt(2)/2 - sqrt(2)/2 =0. So the overlap is zero. \n\nThus S(rho || tau) = - trace(rho ln tau) = - |\u27e8psi|tau\u27e9|^2 ln|tau\u27e9\u27e8tau| + ... but maybe it's better to compute it directly. \n\nSince tau is pure, ln tau = ln(|tau><tau|) is undefined unless it's the projection. But the relative entropy for a pure state rho and pure state tau is -\u27e8rho| ln tau |rho\u27e9. \n\nBut since the overlap is zero, the density matrix rho has no support on tau, so the relative entropy is infinite.

The problem gives the normalization N, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2\u03c6) e^{-2\u03b1\u00b2}). For \u03c6 = -\u03c0/4 and \u03b1 = 0.5, I can compute N first. Let's do that first.\n\nGiven \u03c6 = -\u03c0/4. Let's compute sin(2\u03c6). 2\u03c6 is -\u03c0/2. sin(-\u03c0/2) is -1. Then e^{-2\u03b1\u00b2} is e^{-2*(0.5)^2} = e^{-0.5}. So sin(2\u03c6)*exp(-2\u03b1\u00b2) = (-1)*e^{-0.5} \u2248 -e^{-0.5} \u2248 -0.6065. So 1 + (-0.6065) = 0.3935, so N is sqrt(0.3935) \u2248 0.6273.",

The formula for N is sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi) * exp(-2 alpha^2)). Let me plug in the values.\n\nFirst, sin(2phi) when phi is -pi/4: 2*(-pi/4) = -pi/2. So sin(-pi/2) is -1. Then, exp(-2*(0.5)^2) is exp(-2*(0.25)) = exp(-0.5). So putting it all together:\n\nN = sqrt(1 + (-1)*exp(-0.5)). Let me compute exp(-0.5) first. exp(0.5) is about 1.6487, so exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065. So the term inside the sqrt is 1 + (-1)(0.6065) = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935.

The reference Gaussian state. The problem says \"tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state\". It doesn't specify which Gaussian state. \n\nIn many definitions of non-Gaussianity via relative entropy, tau is the closest Gaussian state to rho in terms of the relative entropy. So the non-Gaussianity is then the minimal relative entropy between rho and any Gaussian state. But in that case, the formula would be S(rho || tau) where tau is the closest Gaussian, and nG is that minimal value. But the problem's formula is given as del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). If that's the case, then if we take tau to be the closest Gaussian state, then the non-Gaussianity would be S(rho || tau) = trace(rho (ln rho - ln tau)) = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau)].

So trace(rho ln rho) = 0.\n\nNow, the question is, what is the reference Gaussian state tau? The problem says \"the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state\". Since the options are numerical, perhaps there's a standard reference state here. Let me think of the standard approach for calculating non-Gaussianity via relative entropy. The standard approach would be to find the minimal relative entropy between rho and any Gaussian state tau. The non-Gaussianity is then this minimal value.
