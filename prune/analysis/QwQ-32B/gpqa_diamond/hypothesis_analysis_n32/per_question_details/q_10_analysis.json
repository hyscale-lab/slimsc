So, to find the density, we need to know how the radius scales with mass for a planet of the same composition.\n\nIn planetary formation models, the radius of a planet with the same composition (so same material density if uncompressed?) might not scale linearly.

If it were just scaled up with same density, its radius would be (5)^(1/3) times Earth's radius, so approx 1.71 R. But if the higher gravity compresses it more, making it denser, then the radius would be smaller than that, so the actual radius is less than 1.71 R. Therefore, the density (mass/volume) would be higher than Earth's. \n\nSo for example, if the radius is the same as Earth's, then the density would be 5 times higher. But that's probably not realistic, but the point is that higher mass with same composition would lead to higher density. \n\nIn that case, option c would have higher density than Earth. So if that's the case, then option c's density is higher than Earth's (5.5). Then the options:\n\na) 5.5\n\nb) 5.5 exactly.\n\nc) higher than 5.5\n\nd) same composition but half mass. Let's see, same composition would mean same density?",

If a planet has the same composition but is more massive, then perhaps the increased gravity compresses the material, so the planet's radius is smaller than expected. Thus, the density (mass/volume) would be higher. \n\nSuppose that the radius increases less than cube root(M/M_e). Let's make a rough calculation. Let's say Earth's mass is M, radius R, density D = M/( (4/3 \u03c0 R\u00b3) ) = 5.5. \n\nFor a planet with 5 M, if the radius were to be proportional to M^(1/3), then R_new = R * (5)^(1/3) \u2248 1.71 R. Then density would be 5M/( (4/3 \u03c0 (1.71R)^3 ) ) = 5/(5) * D = D. So same density. But if the radius is smaller due to compression, say R_new is, say, 1.5 R, then the volume is (1.5)^3 = 3.375 times Earth's. So density would be 5 / 3.375 \u2248 1.48 times Earth's density. So that would be higher. \n\nTherefore, if the planet is more massive, same composition but compressed, then its density is higher. So option c would have higher density than Earth. \n\nSo in that case, option c has higher density than a and b. \n\nNow, option d: same composition as Earth, half the mass. Let's see. If mass is 0.5 M_e, then the radius would be (0.5)^(1/3) \u2248 0.79 R_e. So density would be (0.5 M_e) / ( (4/3 \u03c0 (0.79 R_e)^3) ) = 0.5 / (0.5) = 5.5.",

But how does that compare to option d?\n\nOption d is a planet with same composition as Earth but half the mass. Following the same logic, if mass is smaller, the radius would be smaller, but the density would be lower. Because, for example, if R scales with M^(1/4), then the volume scales as M^(3/4). So density is M/(M^(3/4)) = M^(1/4). So if mass halves, then density would be (0.5)^(1/4) times original. Since original is 5.5, so this would be lower than Earth's density. So option d's density is lower than Earth's. \n\nSo let's recap the options:\n\na is exactly Earth's density (5.5).\n\nb is given as exactly 5.5.\n\nc has higher density than Earth's because same composition but higher mass, leading to higher density.\n\nd has lower density than Earth's.\n\nTherefore, the highest is option c.",

Let me see: suppose Earth's density is M/( (4/3)\u03c0R\u00b3 ) = 5.5. If another planet has 5 times the mass but same composition, then perhaps its radius scales such that (R_new / R_earth) is proportional to (mass)^1/3? Because for similar planets, mass is proportional to radius cubed. So if mass is 5x, radius would be cube root of 5 times Earth's radius. Then the density (mass/volume) would be same as Earth's. So same density. So option c's density is 5.5.\n\nSimilarly, option d would have half the mass but same composition, so radius would be cube root of 0.5 times Earth's radius, but density remains 5.5.\n\nTherefore, all options a, b, c, d have density 5.5 except option b which is explicitly stated as 5.5.",

Let's say Earth's mass is M, radius R, density D = M/( (4/3 \u03c0 R\u00b3) ) = 5.5. \n\nFor a planet with 5 M, if the radius were to be proportional to M^(1/3), then R_new = R * (5)^(1/3) \u2248 1.71 R. Then density would be 5M/( (4/3 \u03c0 (1.71R)^3 ) ) = 5/(5) * D = D. So same density. But if the radius is smaller due to compression, say R_new is, say, 1.5 R, then the volume is (1.5)^3 = 3.375 times Earth's. So density would be 5 / 3.375 \u2248 1.48 times Earth's density. So that would be higher. \n\nTherefore, if the planet is more massive, same composition but compressed, then its density is higher. So option c would have higher density than Earth. \n\nSo in that case, option c has higher density than a and b. \n\nNow, option d: same composition as Earth, half the mass. Let's see. If mass is 0.5 M_e, then the radius would be (0.5)^(1/3) \u2248 0.79 R_e. So density would be (0.5 M_e) / ( (4/3 \u03c0 (0.79 R_e)^3) ) = 0.5 / (0.5) = 5.5.",

Suppose two planets with the same composition (same materials), but different masses. The more massive one will have higher gravity, so the material is compressed more, leading to higher density. So, for instance, if you have a planet with 5x Earth's mass, same composition, the radius would be smaller than cube root(5) times Earth's radius.

For instance, if you have a planet made of same material, mass scales with radius cubed (assuming same density). So if you double the radius, mass is 8 times.
