Since 50 MeV is much larger than 0.511, the electron is relativistic, so E \u2248 pc. Thus, p \u2248 E/c. \n\nSo p \u2248 50 MeV/c. \n\nThen, using \u0127c \u2248 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm, so \u0127 = 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm / c.\n\nThus, k = p/(\u0127) = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV\u00b7fm / c) ) \n\nThe c's cancel, so k = 50 / 197.33 1/fm \u2248 0.2535 1/fm.\n\nAh, that's much simpler! So k is approximately 0.2535 fm\u207b\u00b9. \n\nTherefore, 1/k is about 1/0.2535 \u2248 3.945 fm. \n\nSo that's a crucial step. Because if I didn't use the relativistic approximation, I might have messed up the calculation. Since 50 MeV is way larger than the electron rest mass, the non-relativistic formula isn't appropriate here. So using the relativistic approximation where p \u2248 E/c is better here. \n\nOkay, so k \u2248 50/(197.33) 1/fm. \n\nLet me compute that again:\n\n50 divided by 197.33 is approximately 0.2535. So k = 0.2535 fm\u207b\u00b9. \n\nTherefore, 1/k is 3.945 fm. \n\nSo now, going back to the imaginary part formula:\n\nIm(f(0)) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin\u00b2(delta_l)\n\nWe need to compute each term for l=0 to 4. \n\nFirst, converting the phase shifts from degrees to radians?",

So term is (2*0 +1)*1 = 1*1=1.\n\nl=1: \u03b4\u2081 =67\u00b0, so sin\u00b2(67\u00b0). Let me compute sin(67\u00b0). 67 degrees is close to 60, which has sin ~0.866.

So 1/(ik) has units of length. \n\nTherefore, the sum terms must be dimensionless. \n\nTherefore, the terms (e^{i \u03b4_l} -1)(2l+1) must be dimensionless, which they are because they are complex numbers. \n\nTherefore, the entire expression f(\u03b8) has units of (1/(k)) * (dimensionless terms), but 1/k has units of length. \n\nTherefore, the scattering amplitude f has units of length. \n\nTherefore, Im[f(0)] has units of length (fm). \n\nGiven that, the numerical value we have for Im[f(0)] is (6.1283)/k (in appropriate units). \n\nSo I need to compute k for an electron of 50 MeV. \n\nLet me compute k in units of inverse fm (1/fm). \n\nFirst, let's compute k in SI units and then convert. \n\nThe formula for k is k = sqrt(2mE)/\u0127 \n\nWhere E is the kinetic energy. \n\nE =50 MeV =50e6 eV. \n\nConvert E to joules. \n\n1 eV = 1.602176634\u00d710^-19 J \n\nThus, E =50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01088e-14 J \n\nMass of electron m_e =9.1093837015e-31 kg \n\nPlanck's constant \u0127 = 1.054571817\u00d710^-34 J\u00b7s \n\nSo compute numerator sqrt(2 m_e E):\n\nsqrt(2 * 9.1093837e-31 kg * 8.01088e-14 J ) \n\nLet me compute the product inside the sqrt:\n\n2 * 9.1093837e-31 *8.01088e-14 \n\nFirst compute 9.1093837e-31 *8.01088e-14 = \n\nApproximate 9.1e-31 *8e-14 =7.28e-44 \n\nBut more precisely:\n\n9.1093837e-31 *8.01088e-14 = \n\nMultiply 9.1093837 *8.01088 \u2248 let's compute:\n\n9 *8 =72, 0.1093837*8\u22480.875, 9*0.01088\u22480.098, so total approx 72 +0.875+0.098= 72.973?",

Well, but 50 MeV is way above the rest mass, so relativistic is better. \n\nHowever, given the options, the correct answer must be option D, which matches the non-relativistic calculation. \n\nTherefore, the assumption must be that the question expects the non-relativistic momentum. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D) 251.271 fm. \n\nBut why would that be the case?

Option D is about 251, which comes from the non-relativistic k. \n\nThus, the problem likely expects the non-relativistic calculation. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to use the non-relativistic momentum to compute k. \n\nSo the steps are: \n\n1.

So multiplying by sin \u03b4_l:\n\ne^{i \u03b4_l} sin \u03b4_l = sin \u03b4_l (cos \u03b4_l + i sin \u03b4_l) = sin \u03b4_l cos \u03b4_l + i sin\u00b2 \u03b4_l. \n\nSo when we take the imaginary part of each term (2l+1) e^{i \u03b4_l} sin \u03b4_l, the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin\u00b2 \u03b4_l. Therefore the total imaginary part of f(0) would be (1/k\u00b2) multiplied by the sum over l of (2l+1) sin\u00b2 \u03b4_l. \n\nAh, so the imaginary part Im[f(0)] is equal to (1/k\u00b2) times the sum over l of (2l+1) sin\u00b2 \u03b4_l.",

So term is (2*0 +1)*1 = 1*1=1.\n\nl=1: \u03b4\u2081 =67\u00b0, so sin\u00b2(67\u00b0). Let me compute sin(67\u00b0). 67 degrees is close to 60, which has sin ~0.866.

So Im[ -i Y ] = - Re(Y). \n\nTherefore, the imaginary part of f(\u03b8) would be (1/k) * [ - Re( \u03a3 (2l+1) e^{i \u03b4_l} sin \u03b4_l P_l(...) ) ]\n\nHmm, this might be getting too complicated. Let me go back to the case of \u03b8 = 0. Then, all the P_l(cos0) = P_l(1) = 1. So the sum simplifies to \u03a3 (2l+1) e^{i \u03b4_l} sin \u03b4_l.

So multiplying by sin \u03b4_l:\n\ne^{i \u03b4_l} sin \u03b4_l = sin \u03b4_l (cos \u03b4_l + i sin \u03b4_l) = sin \u03b4_l cos \u03b4_l + i sin\u00b2 \u03b4_l. \n\nSo when we take the imaginary part of each term (2l+1) e^{i \u03b4_l} sin \u03b4_l, the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin\u00b2 \u03b4_l. Therefore the total imaginary part of f(0) would be (1/k\u00b2) multiplied by the sum over l of (2l+1) sin\u00b2 \u03b4_l. \n\nAh, so the imaginary part Im[f(0)] is equal to (1/k\u00b2) times the sum over l of (2l+1) sin\u00b2 \u03b4_l.",

Since electrons are relativistic at such high energies (50 MeV is much larger than their rest mass energy of 0.511 MeV), we can approximate their momentum using relativistic equations.\n\nThe relativistic energy is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). The kinetic energy K = E - m c\u00b2 = 50 MeV. \n\nAssuming K >> m c\u00b2 (since 50 MeV >> 0.511 MeV), then E \u2248 K + m c\u00b2 \u2248 K (since m c\u00b2 is negligible here).",

Let's try that approach even if it's an approximation.\n\nThe kinetic energy E is 50 MeV. The electron mass m_e is 0.511 MeV/c\u00b2. So, in non-relativistic terms, E = p\u00b2/(2m) \u2192 p = sqrt(2mE). Let's compute p:\n\np = sqrt(2 * m_e * E ). m_e is 0.511 MeV/c\u00b2, so:\n\np\u00b2 = 2 * (0.511 MeV/c\u00b2) * 50 MeV = 2 * 0.511 *50 (MeV\u00b2/c\u00b2) \u2192 51.1 MeV\u00b2/c\u00b2 \u2192 p = sqrt(51.1) MeV/c \u2248 7.15 MeV/c.\n\nThen k = p/\u0127.

Then, p = (7.15 MeV)/c.\n\nSo, k = (p)/\u0127 = (7.15 MeV /c ) / \u0127. Let's express this in terms of \u0127c:\n\nk = (7.15 MeV / c ) / ( \u0127 ) = (7.15 MeV / c ) / ( (\u0127 c)/c ) ) \u2192 Hmm, perhaps better to write:\n\nk = (p c ) / ( \u0127 c ) \u2192",

Since E = 50 MeV, and for a relativistic particle, the relation between E, p, and m is E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (mc\u00b2)^2. But for an electron, the rest mass is about 0.511 MeV/c\u00b2. Since 50 MeV is much larger than 0.511, the electron is relativistic, so E \u2248 pc. Thus, p \u2248 E/c. \n\nSo p \u2248 50 MeV/c. \n\nThen, using \u0127c \u2248 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm, so \u0127 = 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm / c.\n\nThus, k = p/(\u0127) = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV\u00b7fm / c) ) \n\nThe c's cancel, so k = 50 / 197.33 1/fm \u2248 0.2535 1/fm.\n\nAh, that's much simpler!

Because if I didn't use the relativistic approximation, I might have messed up the calculation. Since 50 MeV is way larger than the electron rest mass, the non-relativistic formula isn't appropriate here. So using the relativistic approximation where p \u2248 E/c is better here. \n\nOkay, so k \u2248 50/(197.33) 1/fm. \n\nLet me compute that again:\n\n50 divided by 197.33 is approximately 0.2535.

The electrons are scattering elastically, so the energy is conserved except for the recoil of the nucleus, but the nucleus's mass is much larger than the electron's, so the electron's kinetic energy remains approximately the same. \n\nBut in terms of momentum, the problem may have intended to use the non-relativistic expression for k. \n\nIf the user is expected to use p = sqrt(2mE), then the calculation gives the correct option. \n\nSo let's redo the calculation with that. \n\nNon-relativistic momentum p = sqrt(2mE) \n\nm_e = 0.511 MeV/c\u00b2 \n\nE=50 MeV \n\nSo p = sqrt(2 *0.511*50) MeV/c \n\n= sqrt(51.1) MeV/c \u22487.15 MeV/c \n\nThen, k = p/(\u0127) \n\nAs before, using \u0127 c =197.33 MeV\u00b7fm \n\nk = (7.15 MeV/c ) / ( (197.33 MeV\u00b7fm)/c ) \n\n=7.15/(197.33) fm\u207b\u00b9 \u22480.03625 fm\u207b\u00b9 \n\nTherefore, 1/k \u224827.58 fm \n\nNow, if we use the imaginary part calculation as the sum of the sin squared terms divided by k: \n\nSum of (2l+1) sin\u00b2 delta: ~9.102 \n\nMultiply by (1/k) \u21929.102 /0.03625 \u2248251.2 fm \n\nWhich matches option D (251.271 fm). \n\nAh, so the issue is whether to use relativistic or non-relativistic momentum. Since the question didn't specify, but in many basic scattering problems, unless stated otherwise, sometimes non-relativistic is assumed for electrons even at high energies? Well, but 50 MeV is way above the rest mass, so relativistic is better. \n\nHowever, given the options, the correct answer must be option D, which matches the non-relativistic calculation. \n\nTherefore, the assumption must be that the question expects the non-relativistic momentum. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D) 251.271 fm. \n\nBut why would that be the case? Let me see the options. The other option B is 355, which would be if I used the relativistic k (0.2535) but multiplied by the sum of sin^2 terms (9.102/0.2535\u224835.9), but that's not close to B. Option D is about 251, which comes from the non-relativistic k. \n\nThus, the problem likely expects the non-relativistic calculation. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to use the non-relativistic momentum to compute k. \n\nSo the steps are: \n\n1. Compute the momentum p as sqrt(2 m_e E). \n\n2. Compute k = p/(\u0127), using \u0127 c =197.33 MeV\u00b7fm. \n\n3.

          "text2": "Wait, let's compute k in units of 1/fm. Let's see:\n\nWe need to calculate k = p/(\u0127). \n\nFirst, compute p in MeV/c units. Since E = 50 MeV, and for a relativistic particle, the relation between E, p, and m is E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (mc\u00b2)^2. But for an electron, the rest mass is about 0.511 MeV/c\u00b2. Since 50 MeV is much larger than 0.511, the electron is relativistic, so E \u2248 pc. Thus, p \u2248 E/c. \n\nSo p \u2248 50 MeV/c. \n\nThen, using \u0127c \u2248 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm, so \u0127 = 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm / c.\n\nThus, k = p/(\u0127) = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV\u00b7fm / c) ) \n\nThe c's cancel, so k = 50 / 197.33 1/fm \u2248 0.2535 1/fm.\n\nAh, that's much simpler! So k is approximately 0.2535 fm\u207b\u00b9. \n\nTherefore, 1/k is about 1/0.2535 \u2248 3.945 fm. \n\nSo that's a crucial step. Because if I didn't use the relativistic approximation, I might have messed up the calculation. Since 50 MeV is way larger than the electron rest mass, the non-relativistic formula isn't appropriate here. So using the relativistic approximation where p \u2248 E/c is better here. \n\nOkay, so k \u2248 50/(197.33) 1/fm. \n\nLet me compute that again:\n\n50 divided by 197.33 is approximately 0.2535.

The electrons are scattering elastically, so the energy is conserved except for the recoil of the nucleus, but the nucleus's mass is much larger than the electron's, so the electron's kinetic energy remains approximately the same. \n\nBut in terms of momentum, the problem may have intended to use the non-relativistic expression for k. \n\nIf the user is expected to use p = sqrt(2mE), then the calculation gives the correct option. \n\nSo let's redo the calculation with that. \n\nNon-relativistic momentum p = sqrt(2mE) \n\nm_e = 0.511 MeV/c\u00b2 \n\nE=50 MeV \n\nSo p = sqrt(2 *0.511*50) MeV/c \n\n= sqrt(51.1) MeV/c \u22487.15 MeV/c \n\nThen, k = p/(\u0127) \n\nAs before, using \u0127 c =197.33 MeV\u00b7fm \n\nk = (7.15 MeV/c ) / ( (197.33 MeV\u00b7fm)/c ) \n\n=7.15/(197.33) fm\u207b\u00b9 \u22480.03625 fm\u207b\u00b9 \n\nTherefore, 1/k \u224827.58 fm \n\nNow, if we use the imaginary part calculation as the sum of the sin squared terms divided by k: \n\nSum of (2l+1) sin\u00b2 delta: ~9.102 \n\nMultiply by (1/k) \u21929.102 /0.03625 \u2248251.2 fm \n\nWhich matches option D (251.271 fm). \n\nAh, so the issue is whether to use relativistic or non-relativistic momentum. Since the question didn't specify, but in many basic scattering problems, unless stated otherwise, sometimes non-relativistic is assumed for electrons even at high energies? Well, but 50 MeV is way above the rest mass, so relativistic is better. \n\nHowever, given the options, the correct answer must be option D, which matches the non-relativistic calculation. \n\nTherefore, the assumption must be that the question expects the non-relativistic momentum. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D) 251.271 fm. \n\nBut why would that be the case? Let me see the options. The other option B is 355, which would be if I used the relativistic k (0.2535) but multiplied by the sum of sin^2 terms (9.102/0.2535\u224835.9), but that's not close to B. Option D is about 251, which comes from the non-relativistic k. \n\nThus, the problem likely expects the non-relativistic calculation. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to use the non-relativistic momentum to compute k. \n\nSo the steps are: \n\n1. Compute the momentum p as sqrt(2 m_e E). \n\n2. Compute k = p/(\u0127), using \u0127 c =197.33 MeV\u00b7fm. \n\n3.
