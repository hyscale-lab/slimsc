So if I can find \u03b8, then double it to get the answer.\n\nNow, to find \u03b8, I need to apply conservation of momentum and energy. Let's start with energy. The total energy before collision must equal the total energy after. The electron and positron each have energy given by gamma times their rest mass energy. The rest mass energy of an electron (and positron) is 511 keV, right? So the electron's energy is 4*511 keV = 2044 keV, and the positron's is 2*511 = 1022 keV. Total initial energy is 2044 + 1022 = 3066 keV. The two photons each have energy E, so total energy after collision is 2E.

The total angle between them would then be twice that angle. \n\nBut how do we find that angle? Let's consider conservation of energy and momentum. \n\nFirst, let's note that the total energy before collision should equal the total energy after. The total momentum must also be conserved. Since the photons are moving in different directions, their momenta will have both horizontal and vertical components. But because the initial momentum of the system must be conserved, the vertical components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other out. That makes sense because the initial vertical momentum is zero. \n\nLet me start by calculating the energies of the electron and positron. \n\nThe energy of a particle is \u03b3 times its rest mass energy. The rest mass energy for an electron (or positron) is 511 keV. \n\nSo, electron's energy: E_e = \u03b3_e * m_e c\u00b2 = 4 * 511 keV = 2044 keV. \n\nPositron's energy: E_p = \u03b3_p * m_e c\u00b2 = 2 * 511 keV = 1022 keV. \n\nTotal energy before collision: 2044 + 1022 = 3066 keV. \n\nSince energy is conserved, the total energy of the two photons must also be 3066 keV. Since they have equal energy, each photon has energy of 3066 / 2 = 1533 keV. \n\nNow, the momentum of each photon is E/c, because photons have momentum p = E/c. Since both photons have the same energy, their magnitudes of momentum are equal. Let me denote each as p_photon = 1533 keV / c (since energy in keV divided by c gives momentum in keV/c units, but maybe we can work in terms of variables here).",

Let me denote the two photons as photon 1 (upper-right) and photon 2 (lower-right). \n\nTheir momenta must add up to P_total. Since their energies are the same, their magnitudes of momentum are equal (since p = E/c, and E is same). \n\nSo each photon has momentum magnitude p_photon = 3 m c (since their energy is 3 m c\u00b2). \n\nSo each photon's momentum vector has magnitude 3 m c. Let me denote the angle each photon makes with the x-axis. \n\nPhoton 1 is moving upper-right, so above the x-axis, angle \u03b8 from the x-axis upwards. \n\nPhoton 2 is moving lower-right, so angle \u03b8 below the x-axis (so angle -\u03b8 from x-axis).

But the total momentum from the two photons must equal the initial momentum.\n\nHmm, so let me model this. Let's denote the two photons as moving in directions making angles with the x-axis. Since one is upper-right and the other lower-right, their y-components of momentum will be opposite. Let me suppose photon 1 is at angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, photon 2 is at angle -\u03b8 below. So their y-components cancel, so the total momentum is purely in the x-direction. That makes sense because the initial momentum was along x-axis. \n\nTherefore, the total momentum of the two photons must be along the x-axis, matching the initial momentum. Since their y-components cancel, so each photon's momentum in the y-direction is p_photon * sin\u03b8 and -p_photon * sin\u03b8, which cancel. \n\nThe x-components of their momenta add up.

So 2 p c = 6 m_e c\u00b2 \u21d2 p = 3 m_e c.\n\nSo substituting back into the momentum equation:\n\n2 p cos\u03b8 = p_total = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\n\nWe have p = 3 m_e c, so substituting:\n\n2*(3 m_e c)*cos\u03b8 = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\n\nThe m_e c terms cancel out, so:\n\n6 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)\n\nTherefore, cos\u03b8 = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / 6\n\nNow compute the numerical value of sqrt(15) \u2248 3.87298, sqrt(3) \u22481.73205.

Let me compute more precisely. \n\nLet me compute cos\u207b\u00b9(0.3568):\n\nThe difference between 0.3428 (cos70) and 0.3568 is 0.014.

Also, the photons have the same energy, so their magnitudes of momentum are the same (since p = E/c for photons). Let me denote each photon's momentum as p_photon = E_photon / c.

Hmm, but when they annihilate into two photons, the total momentum of the photons must equal the initial total momentum. \n\nThe photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions. Let me imagine the coordinate system. The two photons are moving such that one is upper-right (so above the x-axis) and the other is lower-right (below the x-axis). Therefore, their vertical components of momentum must cancel each other out (since the initial momentum in the y-direction is zero). So the vertical components of their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, meaning their angles above and below the x-axis are equal. Let's denote each photon's angle with the x-axis as \u03b8. So one is at \u03b8 above the x-axis, the other at \u03b8 below. \n\nSince the photons have the same energy, their momenta must have the same magnitude. Because for photons, energy is p*c, so same energy implies same p (since c is constant). Since their momenta are in the same direction (along their direction of motion), their magnitudes must be equal. \n\nSo let me denote each photon's momentum magnitude as p_photon. The total momentum after collision is the sum of the two photons' momenta. Let's resolve this into x and y components.\n\nThe y-components: For the upper photon, the y-component is p_photon * sin\u03b8 upward, the lower photon's is downward, so p_photon * sin\u03b8 downward. Since they must cancel, that's okay. So the net y momentum is zero, which matches the initial condition.\n\nThe x-components: Both photons are moving to the right (since upper-right and lower-right directions are both rightward). So each photon has an x-component of p_photon * cos\u03b8. Therefore, the total x-momentum after collision is 2 * p_photon * cos\u03b8.\n\nThis must equal the initial total x-momentum.

So the photons' momenta must add up to the total initial momentum. \n\nLet me think. Let me denote the two photons as photon 1 (upper-right) and photon 2 (lower-right). Since they have same energy, their momenta magnitudes are equal. Let me denote the magnitude of each photon's momentum as p_photon. Since energy E = pc, so p = E/c. Since their energies are equal, their momenta have same magnitude.\n\nLet me consider their directions. Let\u2019s define the angle of each photon with the x-axis. Let\u2019s say photon 1 (upper-right) makes an angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, and photon 2 (lower-right) makes angle \u03b8 below the x-axis. Therefore, the angle between them is 2\u03b8. The question is asking for this angle between the two directions, which would be 2\u03b8. \n\nThe total momentum of the photons must equal the initial momentum. Let me consider components.\n\nThe total momentum of the photons must be equal to P_total (the initial momentum we calculated). Let's break into x and y components.\n\nSince the photons' directions are symmetric with respect to the x-axis, the y-components of their momenta will cancel each other out. Because one has +y component and the other -y component. Therefore, the total y-component of the photons' momentum is zero. However, the initial momentum (from the electron and positron) must have a y-component of zero, because the initial particles are moving along the x-axis. Therefore, this makes sense. \n\nTherefore, the total momentum of the photons must have all its component along the x-axis, same as the initial momentum. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the x-components of the photons' momentum must equal P_total, and the y-components must cancel.\n\nLet me write equations for this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the momentum of each photon as p_photon (since their energies are same, their momenta magnitudes are same). \n\nFor photon 1: p1_x = p_photon * cos\u03b8, p1_y = p_photon * sin\u03b8.\n\nPhoton 2: p2_x = p_photon * cos\u03b8 (since it's angle below x-axis, the cosine is same, sine is negative). p2_y = - p_photon * sin\u03b8.\n\nTotal momentum in x direction: p1_x + p2_x = 2 p_photon cos\u03b8.\n\nTotal y: p1_y + p2_y = 0, which is okay.\n\nThis must equal the initial momentum which is along x-axis: P_total = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )\n\nSo 2 p_photon cos\u03b8 = P_total.\n\nAlso, the total energy of the photons must equal the total energy of the initial particles. The energy of each photon is E_photon = p_photon * c. Since there are two photons, total energy is 2 p_photon c = E_total =6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, 2 p_photon c =6 m_e c\u00b2 \u2192 p_photon = 3 m_e c.\n\nSo substituting back into the momentum equation:\n\n2 * (3 m_e c) * cos\u03b8 = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )\n\nDivide both sides by m_e c:\n\n2 *3 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)\n\nSo 6 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)\n\nTherefore, cos\u03b8 = [ sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ] /6 \n\nHmm, let me compute the numerical value here.\n\nFirst, sqrt(15) is approx 3.87298, sqrt(3) is approx 1.73205.\n\nSubtracting: 3.87298 - 1.73205 \u2248 2.14093\n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093 /6 \u2248 0.35682.\n\nSo cos\u03b8 \u2248 0.35682 \u2192 \u03b8 \u2248 arccos(0.35682).

So if we can find \u03b8, we can get the angle between the two photons.\n\nSo, to find \u03b8, we can use momentum conservation. The total momentum after collision must equal the initial momentum. Since the photons are emitting in the x direction with some vertical components, but their vertical components will cancel each other (because one is +y and the other -y with same magnitude). Therefore, the vertical components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other, which they do, so that's okay. The horizontal components add up to the total initial momentum.\n\nLet me write the components.\n\nEach photon's momentum has horizontal (x) and vertical (y) components. Let's consider the first photon (upper-right) at angle \u03b8 above x-axis. Its momentum components are:\n\np1_x = p_photon * cos\u03b8 (positive x)\np1_y = p_photon * sin\u03b8 (positive y)\n\nThe second photon (lower-right) is at angle -\u03b8 below x-axis. Its components:\n\np2_x = p_photon * cos\u03b8 (positive x)\np2_y = -p_photon * sin\u03b8 (negative y)\n\nSo total momentum after collision:\n\nTotal x: p1_x + p2_x = 2 p_photon cos\u03b8\n\nTotal y: p1_y + p2_y = 0 (they cancel)\n\nTherefore, the total momentum after collision is (2 p_photon cos\u03b8, 0). The initial momentum was (m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)), 0). Since momentum must be conserved, so:\n\n2 p_photon cos\u03b8 = m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\n\nWe know that p_photon is 3m, so substituting:\n\n2 * 3m * cos\u03b8 = m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\n\nDivide both sides by m:\n\n6 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)\n\nTherefore,\n\ncos\u03b8 = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6\n\nThen \u03b8 = arccos [ (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) /6 ]\n\nCompute that value numerically.

Since photons' energy is related to their momentum, which is related to their direction. \n\nSince the total momentum must be conserved, the sum of the two photons' momenta must equal the total initial momentum (since in the center of mass frame, but wait, no, in this case, the problem is in the lab frame where the electron and positron are moving towards each other with given gamma factors. So the photons' momenta must add up to the total initial momentum. \n\nLet me think. Let me denote the two photons as photon 1 (upper-right) and photon 2 (lower-right). Since they have same energy, their momenta magnitudes are equal. Let me denote the magnitude of each photon's momentum as p_photon. Since energy E = pc, so p = E/c. Since their energies are equal, their momenta have same magnitude.\n\nLet me consider their directions. Let\u2019s define the angle of each photon with the x-axis. Let\u2019s say photon 1 (upper-right) makes an angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, and photon 2 (lower-right) makes angle \u03b8 below the x-axis. Therefore, the angle between them is 2\u03b8. The question is asking for this angle between the two directions, which would be 2\u03b8. \n\nThe total momentum of the photons must equal the initial momentum. Let me consider components.\n\nThe total momentum of the photons must be equal to P_total (the initial momentum we calculated). Let's break into x and y components.\n\nSince the photons' directions are symmetric with respect to the x-axis, the y-components of their momenta will cancel each other out. Because one has +y component and the other -y component. Therefore, the total y-component of the photons' momentum is zero. However, the initial momentum (from the electron and positron) must have a y-component of zero, because the initial particles are moving along the x-axis. Therefore, this makes sense. \n\nTherefore, the total momentum of the photons must have all its component along the x-axis, same as the initial momentum. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the x-components of the photons' momentum must equal P_total, and the y-components must cancel.\n\nLet me write equations for this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the momentum of each photon as p_photon (since their energies are same, their momenta magnitudes are same). \n\nFor photon 1: p1_x = p_photon * cos\u03b8, p1_y = p_photon * sin\u03b8.\n\nPhoton 2: p2_x = p_photon * cos\u03b8 (since it's angle below x-axis, the cosine is same, sine is negative). p2_y = - p_photon * sin\u03b8.\n\nTotal momentum in x direction: p1_x + p2_x = 2 p_photon cos\u03b8.\n\nTotal y: p1_y + p2_y = 0, which is okay.\n\nThis must equal the initial momentum which is along x-axis: P_total = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )\n\nSo 2 p_photon cos\u03b8 = P_total.\n\nAlso, the total energy of the photons must equal the total energy of the initial particles. The energy of each photon is E_photon = p_photon * c. Since there are two photons, total energy is 2 p_photon c = E_total =6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, 2 p_photon c =6 m_e c\u00b2 \u2192 p_photon = 3 m_e c.\n\nSo substituting back into the momentum equation:\n\n2 * (3 m_e c) * cos\u03b8 = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )\n\nDivide both sides by m_e c:\n\n2 *3 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)\n\nSo 6 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)\n\nTherefore, cos\u03b8 = [ sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ] /6 \n\nHmm, let me compute the numerical value here.\n\nFirst, sqrt(15) is approx 3.87298, sqrt(3) is approx 1.73205.\n\nSubtracting: 3.87298 - 1.73205 \u2248 2.14093\n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093 /6 \u2248 0.35682.\n\nSo cos\u03b8 \u2248 0.35682 \u2192 \u03b8 \u2248 arccos(0.35682). Let me calculate that.\n\nArccos(0.35682) is approximately 69 degrees (since cos(60)=0.5, cos(69) is around 0.358, so close). Let me check with calculator:\n\ncos(69\u00b0) \u2248 0.358, yes. So \u03b8 is approximately 69 degrees. Therefore the angle between the two photons is 2\u03b8 = 138 degrees. \n\nHmm, that's option C. Let me check the options again. The options are A)74, B)172, C)138, D)96. So 138 is option C.",

Let me denote each photon's momentum magnitude as p_photon. Let's denote the angle each makes with the x-axis as \u03b8. One is \u03b8 above the x-axis, the other \u03b8 below.

Each photon's energy is 3 m_e c\u00b2, so p_photon = (3 m_e c\u00b2)/c = 3 m_e c. \n\nThe momentum of each photon can be decomposed into x and y components. Let\u2019s denote the angle of each photon with respect to the x-axis as \u03b8. Since one is above and the other below, their y-components will cancel (since one is + and the other -). \n\nSo, total momentum after collision must equal the total momentum before. \n\nThe x-components of the photon's momenta must add up to the total momentum before collision. The y-components must cancel each other. \n\nLet me write equations. \n\nLet\u2019s denote the two photons as photon A (upper-right) and photon B (lower-right). \n\nPhoton A has momentum vector: p_photon (cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8)\nPhoton B: p_photon (cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8)\n\nTotal momentum after collision is the sum of these. \n\nThe x-component total is p_photon (cos\u03b8 + cos\u03b8) = 2 p_photon cos\u03b8 \nThe y-component is p_photon sin\u03b8 - p_photon sin\u03b8 = 0, which is fine because the initial momentum had no y-component. \n\nThe total momentum before collision was (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c (from earlier calculation). \n\nTherefore, setting the x-components equal:\n\n2 p_photon cos\u03b8 = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c \n\nWe know p_photon = 3 m_e c, so substituting:\n\n2*(3 m_e c)* cos\u03b8 = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c \n\nDivide both sides by m_e c:\n\n2*3 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)\n\nSo 6 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)\n\nThen cos\u03b8 = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6 \n\nHmm.

The cosine of 60 degrees is 0.5, 70 degrees is about 0.3428. So 0.3568 is between 60 and 70. Let's see:\n\ncos(67 degrees): cos(67) \u2248 0.3907.

So if we can find \u03b8, we can get the angle between the two photons.\n\nSo, to find \u03b8, we can use momentum conservation. The total momentum after collision must equal the initial momentum. Since the photons are emitting in the x direction with some vertical components, but their vertical components will cancel each other (because one is +y and the other -y with same magnitude). Therefore, the vertical components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other, which they do, so that's okay. The horizontal components add up to the total initial momentum.\n\nLet me write the components.\n\nEach photon's momentum has horizontal (x) and vertical (y) components. Let's consider the first photon (upper-right) at angle \u03b8 above x-axis. Its momentum components are:\n\np1_x = p_photon * cos\u03b8 (positive x)\np1_y = p_photon * sin\u03b8 (positive y)\n\nThe second photon (lower-right) is at angle -\u03b8 below x-axis. Its components:\n\np2_x = p_photon * cos\u03b8 (positive x)\np2_y = -p_photon * sin\u03b8 (negative y)\n\nSo total momentum after collision:\n\nTotal x: p1_x + p2_x = 2 p_photon cos\u03b8\n\nTotal y: p1_y + p2_y = 0 (they cancel)\n\nTherefore, the total momentum after collision is (2 p_photon cos\u03b8, 0). The initial momentum was (m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)), 0). Since momentum must be conserved, so:\n\n2 p_photon cos\u03b8 = m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\n\nWe know that p_photon is 3m, so substituting:\n\n2 * 3m * cos\u03b8 = m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\n\nDivide both sides by m:\n\n6 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)\n\nTherefore,\n\ncos\u03b8 = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6\n\nThen \u03b8 = arccos [ (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) /6 ]\n\nCompute that value numerically.

Looking at the options, option C is 138. \n\nLet me double-check the steps to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, total energy: 4 +2 =6 m_e c\u00b2. The photons' total energy is 2 p_photon c =6 m_e c\u00b2 \u2192 p_photon is indeed 3 m_e c. \n\nMomentum: The initial momentum is (p_e - p_p), which is sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) times m_e c. Let's compute sqrt(15) is approx 3.87298, sqrt(3) ~1.732, so difference is ~2.14098 m_e c. \n\nThen 2 * p_photon * cos(theta) = that value. Since p_photon is 3 m_e c, 2*3*cos(theta) =2.14098 \u2192 cos(theta)= (2.14098)/(6) =0.35683. \n\nYes. Arccos(0.35683)= approximately 69 degrees. So 2 theta is 138 degrees.

Since there are two photons, total x component is 2 * 3 m_e c cos\u03b8. \n\nSetting equal to the initial momentum:\n\n2*(3 m_e c cos\u03b8) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c \u2192 6 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3). \n\nSo cos\u03b8 = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/(6). \n\nLet me compute that expression exactly. Let's see:\n\nsqrt(15) = sqrt(3*5) = sqrt(3)*sqrt(5). So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)(sqrt(5) -1). So:\n\ncos\u03b8 = [sqrt(3)(sqrt(5)-1)] /6 = [sqrt(3)(sqrt(5)-1)]/(6). Not sure if that helps, but let's compute the numerical value again.\n\nsqrt(15) is approx 3.87298, sqrt(3) is 1.73205. So subtracting gives 3.87298 -1.73205 \u2248 2.14093. Divide by 6 gives approx 0.35682. \n\nSo arccos(0.35682) is approximately what? Let me compute using calculator steps:\n\nWe can use a calculator here. Let me think of some angles. Let's see:\n\ncos(67.5\u00b0) = cos(45+22.5) = cos45 cos22.5 - sin45 sin22.5. Not sure, but perhaps better to use a calculator's approximate.",
          "text2": "Wait, let me check that again. The positron's momentum is in the opposite direction, so subtract. So total initial momentum is m sqrt(15)c - m sqrt(3)c = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)). \n\nThe photons must have a total momentum equal to this. Let me denote the two photons as photon 1 and photon 2. Each has momentum vector p1 and p2. Their total must be p1 + p2 = p_initial. \n\nEach photon's momentum magnitude is p = E/c = 3m (since E is 3m c\u00b2, so divided by c gives 3m c). So p1 and p2 each have magnitude 3m c. \n\nLet me set up the coordinate system. Let\u2019s have the x-axis as the direction of the electron's motion (left to right). The first photon is moving upper-right, which would be at some angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, and the second is lower-right, at angle \u03b8 below. \n\nTherefore, the momentum vectors can be written as:\np1 = 3m c (cos\u03b8 i + sin\u03b8 j)\np2 = 3m c (cos\u03b8 i - sin\u03b8 j)\n\nAdding them together:\np1 + p2 = 3m c [ (cos\u03b8 + cos\u03b8)i + (sin\u03b8 - sin\u03b8)j ] = 3m c (2 cos\u03b8 i + 0 j)\nSo the total momentum of the photons is 6 m c cos\u03b8 in the x-direction. \n\nBut this must equal the initial momentum, which was m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nTherefore:\n6 m c cos\u03b8 = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\nDivide both sides by m c:\n6 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)\nSo cos\u03b8 = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / 6\n\nLet me compute that numerically. \n\nsqrt(15) is approx 3.87298, sqrt(3) is approx 1.73205.

The total energy before collision must equal the total energy after. The electron and positron each have energy given by gamma times their rest mass energy. The rest mass energy of an electron (and positron) is 511 keV, right? So the electron's energy is 4*511 keV = 2044 keV, and the positron's is 2*511 = 1022 keV.

Since the photons are moving in different directions, their momenta will have both horizontal and vertical components. But because the initial momentum of the system must be conserved, the vertical components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other out. That makes sense because the initial vertical momentum is zero. \n\nLet me start by calculating the energies of the electron and positron. \n\nThe energy of a particle is \u03b3 times its rest mass energy.

So the question is to find 2\u03b8. \n\nBut first, let's compute the total energy and momentum before collision. \n\nTotal energy before collision is the sum of the electron and positron energies. Since they're both particles, their energies are gamma*m_e c\u00b2. So total energy is 4 m_e c\u00b2 + 2 m_e c\u00b2 = 6 m_e c\u00b2. \n\nTotal momentum: the electron's momentum is gamma_e * m_e * v_e, but since momentum is a vector, the positron's momentum is in the opposite direction.

So if I can find \u03b8, then double it to get the answer.\n\nNow, to find \u03b8, I need to apply conservation of momentum and energy. Let's start with energy. The total energy before collision must equal the total energy after. The electron and positron each have energy given by gamma times their rest mass energy. The rest mass energy of an electron (and positron) is 511 keV, right? So the electron's energy is 4*511 keV = 2044 keV, and the positron's is 2*511 = 1022 keV. Total initial energy is 2044 + 1022 = 3066 keV. The two photons each have energy E, so total energy after collision is 2E. Therefore, 2E = 3066 \u2192 E = 1533 keV. \n\nSo each photon has energy of 1533 keV. Since E = pc, their momentum magnitudes are p = E/c.

The photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions. Let me denote their momenta as vectors. Let each photon have momentum magnitude p. Since their energies are the same, their momenta magnitudes are equal. Let's denote each photon's angle with the x-axis as \u03b8. The upper-right photon has an angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, and the lower-right one has angle \u03b8 below. \n\nThe momentum vectors of the photons will then have components:\n\nFor the upper photon:\np_x_upper = p cos\u03b8 (positive x-direction)\np_y_upper = p sin\u03b8 (positive y-direction)\n\nFor the lower photon:\np_x_lower = p cos\u03b8 (also positive x-direction, because both are moving to the right)\np_y_lower = -p sin\u03b8 (negative y-direction)\n\nAdding the y-components: p sin\u03b8 - p sin\u03b8 = 0, which makes sense because the initial momentum had no y-component, so that's conserved. \n\nThe x-components must add up to the total initial momentum. The total x-component from the photons is p cos\u03b8 + p cos\u03b8 = 2p cos\u03b8.

Let me denote the two photons as photon 1 (upper-right) and photon 2 (lower-right). \n\nTheir momenta must add up to P_total. Since their energies are the same, their magnitudes of momentum are equal (since p = E/c, and E is same). \n\nSo each photon has momentum magnitude p_photon = 3 m c (since their energy is 3 m c\u00b2). \n\nSo each photon's momentum vector has magnitude 3 m c.

But the total momentum from the two photons must equal the initial momentum.\n\nHmm, so let me model this. Let's denote the two photons as moving in directions making angles with the x-axis. Since one is upper-right and the other lower-right, their y-components of momentum will be opposite. Let me suppose photon 1 is at angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, photon 2 is at angle -\u03b8 below. So their y-components cancel, so the total momentum is purely in the x-direction. That makes sense because the initial momentum was along x-axis. \n\nTherefore, the total momentum of the two photons must be along the x-axis, matching the initial momentum. Since their y-components cancel, so each photon's momentum in the y-direction is p_photon * sin\u03b8 and -p_photon * sin\u03b8, which cancel. \n\nThe x-components of their momenta add up.

Let me think of the vectors. If one photon is at angle \u03b8 above the x-axis and the other at angle \u03b8 below, then the angle between them is 2\u03b8. That's probably right.\n\nSo, to find 2\u03b8, the angle between them. So the problem reduces to finding \u03b8 first.\n\nNow, let me set up equations. Let me denote the momentum of each photon as p (since they have the same energy, so same |p|). Let me set up coordinate system with x-axis along the original motion of the electron (left to right). The photons are moving in upper-right (\u03b8 above x) and lower-right (\u03b8 below x).

The initial energy is E_initial = E_e + E_p = gamma_e m_e c\u00b2 + gamma_p m_e c\u00b2 = (4 + 2) m_e c\u00b2 = 6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nThe total energy of the photons is E_photon_total = 2 p c (since each photon has E = p c, and two of them). So 2 p c = 6 m_e c\u00b2 \u21d2 p = 3 m_e c.\n\nSo substituting back into the momentum equation:\n\n2 p cos\u03b8 = p_total = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\n\nWe have p = 3 m_e c, so substituting:\n\n2*(3 m_e c)*cos\u03b8 = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\n\nThe m_e c terms cancel out, so:\n\n6 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)\n\nTherefore, cos\u03b8 = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / 6\n\nNow compute the numerical value of sqrt(15) \u2248 3.87298, sqrt(3) \u22481.73205.

Let me compute more precisely. \n\nLet me compute cos\u207b\u00b9(0.3568):\n\nThe difference between 0.3428 (cos70) and 0.3568 is 0.014.

Since E_initial is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron, E_initial = (\u03b3_e + \u03b3_p) m c\u00b2. So p_photon = (\u03b3_e + \u03b3_p)m c / 2. \n\nThe vertical components of the two photons' momenta must cancel. So for photon 1 (upper-right), the vertical component is p_photon sin\u03b8, upwards.

Since the photons are emitting in the x direction with some vertical components, but their vertical components will cancel each other (because one is +y and the other -y with same magnitude). Therefore, the vertical components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other, which they do, so that's okay.

So if I can find \u03b8, then double it to get the answer.\n\nNow, to find \u03b8, I need to apply conservation of momentum and energy. Let's start with energy. The total energy before collision must equal the total energy after. The electron and positron each have energy given by gamma times their rest mass energy. The rest mass energy of an electron (and positron) is 511 keV, right? So the electron's energy is 4*511 keV = 2044 keV, and the positron's is 2*511 = 1022 keV.

Let's consider conservation of energy and momentum. \n\nFirst, let's note that the total energy before collision should equal the total energy after. The total momentum must also be conserved. Since the photons are moving in different directions, their momenta will have both horizontal and vertical components. But because the initial momentum of the system must be conserved, the vertical components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other out. That makes sense because the initial vertical momentum is zero. \n\nLet me start by calculating the energies of the electron and positron. \n\nThe energy of a particle is \u03b3 times its rest mass energy. The rest mass energy for an electron (or positron) is 511 keV. \n\nSo, electron's energy: E_e = \u03b3_e * m_e c\u00b2 = 4 * 511 keV = 2044 keV. \n\nPositron's energy: E_p = \u03b3_p * m_e c\u00b2 = 2 * 511 keV = 1022 keV. \n\nTotal energy before collision: 2044 + 1022 = 3066 keV. \n\nSince energy is conserved, the total energy of the two photons must also be 3066 keV.

Since both photons have the same energy, their magnitudes of momentum are equal.

Also, the photons have the same energy, so their magnitudes of momentum are the same (since p = E/c for photons). Let me denote each photon's momentum as p_photon = E_photon / c. Since each photon has energy 3m c\u00b2, then p_photon = (3m c\u00b2)/c = 3m c. \n\nSo each photon has momentum magnitude 3m c. Let me denote the two photons as photon 1 (upper-right) and photon 2 (lower-right). Let\u2019s set up coordinate system: x-axis is the direction the electron was moving, y-axis is vertical.

Since one is above and the other below, their y-components will cancel (since one is + and the other -). \n\nSo, total momentum after collision must equal the total momentum before. \n\nThe x-components of the photon's momenta must add up to the total momentum before collision.

Since the photons are emitting in the x direction with some vertical components, but their vertical components will cancel each other (because one is +y and the other -y with same magnitude). Therefore, the vertical components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other, which they do, so that's okay. The horizontal components add up to the total initial momentum.\n\nLet me write the components.\n\nEach photon's momentum has horizontal (x) and vertical (y) components.

Let me proceed with that approach. \n\nLet me redefine variables in natural units where c=1. \n\nThen, the rest mass energy of the electron is m_e (with units of energy, since c=1). \n\nEnergy of electron: E_e = \u03b3_e m_e =4 m_e \n\nEnergy of positron: E_p = \u03b3_p m_e =2 m_e \n\nTotal energy before collision: 4m_e +2m_e=6m_e \n\nEach photon has energy E_photon =6m_e /2=3m_e \n\nSo each photon's momentum is p_photon = E_photon (since c=1) = 3m_e \n\nThe initial momenta: \n\nElectron's momentum p_e = sqrt( (E_e)^2 - m_e^2 ) = sqrt( (4m)^2 - (m)^2 ) = sqrt(15)m \n\nSimilarly, positron's momentum p_p = sqrt( (2m)^2 - m^2 )=sqrt(3)m \n\nThe total initial momentum is p_e (since electron is moving in +x) minus p_p (since positron is moving in -x direction).",

The first photon is moving upper-right, which would be at some angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, and the second is lower-right, at angle \u03b8 below. \n\nTherefore, the momentum vectors can be written as:\np1 = 3m c (cos\u03b8 i + sin\u03b8 j)\np2 = 3m c (cos\u03b8 i - sin\u03b8 j)\n\nAdding them together:\np1 + p2 = 3m c [ (cos\u03b8 + cos\u03b8)i + (sin\u03b8 - sin\u03b8)j ] = 3m c (2 cos\u03b8 i + 0 j)\nSo the total momentum of the photons is 6 m c cos\u03b8 in the x-direction. \n\nBut this must equal the initial momentum, which was m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nTherefore:\n6 m c cos\u03b8 = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\nDivide both sides by m c:\n6 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)\nSo cos\u03b8 = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / 6\n\nLet me compute that numerically. \n\nsqrt(15) is approx 3.87298, sqrt(3) is approx 1.73205.
