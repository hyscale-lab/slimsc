The quasar is behind the cloud, at a higher redshift than the cloud. The absorption occurs at the cloud's redshift. Therefore, the wavelength of the absorption line is \u03bb = 1216*(1+z_cloud). To observe this line on the ground, this \u03bb must be in the optical band (>=3000 \u00c5). Therefore, the minimal z_cloud is when \u03bb=3000, so z_cloud = (3000/1216 -1) \u22481.465.

To observe this absorption in the optical, the observed wavelength must be greater than or equal to 4000\u00c5 (since optical is up to around 7000). So the smallest redshift where the observed wavelength is just at the edge of optical (4000\u00c5) is when (1+z)*1216 = 4000. Solving for z gives (4000/1216) -1 \u2248 2.288.

The quasar is behind the cloud, at a higher redshift than the cloud. The absorption occurs at the cloud's redshift. Therefore, the wavelength of the absorption line is \u03bb = 1216*(1+z_cloud). To observe this line on the ground, this \u03bb must be in the optical band (>=3000 \u00c5). Therefore, the minimal z_cloud is when \u03bb=3000, so z_cloud = (3000/1216 -1) \u22481.465.

To observe this absorption in the optical, the observed wavelength must be greater than or equal to 4000\u00c5 (since optical is up to around 7000). So the smallest redshift where the observed wavelength is just at the edge of optical (4000\u00c5) is when (1+z)*1216 = 4000. Solving for z gives (4000/1216) -1 \u2248 2.288.

But the options are B (1.2), D (1.9), C (2.4), etc. So maybe I need to check again. Let me look up the approximate atmospheric transmission in the UV. \n\nI recall that the Earth's atmosphere is opaque below about 300 nm (3000 A). For example, the ozone layer absorbs most of the UV below 300 nm. Therefore, any wavelength below that is blocked. So, the minimum observable wavelength from the ground is around 300 nm. Therefore, the observed wavelength must be greater than 3000 A. \n\nSo using that, the calculation gives (1+z) = 3000/1216 \u2248 2.466, so z \u2248 1.466. The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift such that they can be detected. So any z higher than this value (1.466) would allow the absorption to be seen. The lower limit is the minimal z where the absorption is just at the cutoff. \n\nLooking at the options, the closest is B (1.2) and D (1.9). But 1.466 is between 1.2 and 1.9. So why is that?

So the observed wavelength must be at least 3000 \u00c5 to pass through. So the absorption line must have an observed wavelength above 3000 \u00c5. \n\nSo the observed wavelength is (1+z)*rest wavelength. So (1+z)*1216 \u2265 3000.
