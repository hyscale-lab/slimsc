The H on C3 (5.5 ppm) would be coupled to that H (J=16) and also to the adjacent CH3 (J=7?), making a dq. That fits the data. \n\nThen the methyl at 1.6 is the CH3 at C4, which is attached to C3 (the CH). Its coupling to the proton on C3 would give a doublet (the J with C3's H).

The protons on the double bond would be:\n\nC2: CH (one H) and C3: CH (one H, trans to C2's H).\n\nThe H on C2 is coupled to the H on C3 (J=16 Hz, forming a doublet at 7.0 ppm). The H on C3 is coupled to the H on C2 and to the two H's on C4 (CH2-OAc). The coupling to C4's two H's would give a quartet (since two H's on adjacent carbon). So the H on C3 would be a doublet (from C2) plus quartet (from C4), making a doublet of quartets, which matches the 5.5 ppm dq. \n\nThe CH2 on C1 (two H's) would be next to the double bond. Their chemical shift might be around 5-6 ppm, but if they're adjacent to the double bond, maybe around 4-5 ppm. Since they're not mentioned in the peaks, perhaps they are part of the CH2 at 5.5? No, the 5.5 is a singlet?",
