So why the discrepancy with the options? Let me check the options again.\n\nOption A:5.0223 *10^-16 m\n\nB:4.0655 *10^-15 m\n\nC:5.0223 *10^-15 m\n\nD:4.0655 *10^-16 m\n\nMy calculation is ~3.05e-16 m, which is between D and A.

So why the discrepancy with the options? Let me check the options again.\n\nOption A:5.0223 *10^-16 m\n\nB:4.0655 *10^-15 m\n\nC:5.0223 *10^-15 m\n\nD:4.0655 *10^-16 m\n\nMy calculation is ~3.05e-16 m, which is between D and A.
