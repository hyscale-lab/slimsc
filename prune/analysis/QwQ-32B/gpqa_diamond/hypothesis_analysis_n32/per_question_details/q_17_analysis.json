          "text1": "Wait, actually, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the complex. So the concentration of CaEDTA is 0.02 M. We need to find [Ca\u00b2+], the concentration of free calcium ions. \n\nThe formation constant K is very large (5e10), which means the complex is very stable. So the dissociation would be minimal. But how do we calculate [Ca\u00b2+]?\n\nThe formula for K would be K = [CaEDTA] / ([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-]). Since the complex is 1:1, the amount of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4- that dissociate should be equal. Let\u2019s let x be the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4- when they dissociate. \n\nAt equilibrium, [CaEDTA] = 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02 (since K is so large, x is negligible compared to 0.02). So, substituting into the equation:\n\nK = (0.02) / (x * x) \u2192 K = 0.02 / x\u00b2\n\nWe can solve for x, which is [Ca\u00b2+].\n\nRearranging, x\u00b2 = 0.02 / K \u2192 x = sqrt(0.02 / (5e10))\n\nLet me calculate that. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5)*1e-12, which is 0.4e-12. Taking the square root gives sqrt(0.4e-12) = sqrt(0.4)*1e-6. \n\nThe square root of 0.4 is about 0.632. So that gives 0.632e-6 = 6.32e-7 M. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 6.3x10^-7 M. So that's probably the answer. Let me double-check my steps. \n\nThe key assumption here is that x is negligible compared to 0.02, so we can approximate [CaEDTA] as 0.02. Since K is so large (1e10 is already a huge number, so 5e10 is even bigger), the dissociation is indeed minimal, so the approximation holds.",

So, the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, the total concentration of Ca is 0.02 M (since each complex has one Ca^2+). \n\nBut to find the free [Ca^2+], I need to consider the dissociation of the complex.

So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13 \n\nTherefore, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5?",

Let me set up the variables. Let\u2019s denote [Ca\u00b2+] = x, [EDTA] = y, and [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02. \n\nThe formation constant is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA]) = 5e10. \n\nWe also know that the total concentration of EDTA is equal to the EDTA in the complex plus free EDTA.

Let me set up the variables. Let\u2019s denote [Ca\u00b2+] = x, [EDTA] = y, and [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02. \n\nThe formation constant is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA]) = 5e10. \n\nWe also know that the total concentration of EDTA is equal to the EDTA in the complex plus free EDTA. Similarly for Ca. Since the solution is stoichiometric, the total EDTA and total Ca must be equal. \n\nSo, total EDTA = [EDTA] + [Ca-EDTA] = y + 0.02. \n\nTotal Ca = [Ca\u00b2+] + [Ca-EDTA] = x + 0.02. \n\nSince it's stoichiometric, total EDTA = total Ca.

So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5)*1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. \n\nTherefore x squared is 4e-13, so x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5?",

But the problem states the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Hmm.\n\nLet me think again. The problem states the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the [Ca-EDTA] is 0.02 M. The Kf is 5e10, which is very large, so the free Ca\u00b2+ concentration should be very low. To calculate [Ca\u00b2+], we can use the Kf expression.\n\nThe formation constant Kf = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA]). Since Kf is large, the denominator [Ca\u00b2+][EDTA] must be very small. But since the complex is formed from Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA, the concentrations of free Ca and EDTA should be equal because they react in 1:1 ratio. Let me denote [Ca\u00b2+] = [EDTA] = x. Then the expression becomes:\n\nKf = (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02 / x\u00b2 = 5e10.\n\nSolving for x\u00b2 = 0.02 / (5e10) \u2192 x\u00b2 = 2e-2 / 5e10 \u2192 x\u00b2 = 4e-13 / 1e1?",

Let me think again.\n\nThe formula for the formation constant is Kf = [CaEDTA\u00b2\u207b] / ([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA\u2074\u207b]). Since the problem states that the solution has 0.02 M CaEDTA complex, that would mean [CaEDTA\u00b2\u207b] is 0.02 M. Assuming that the EDTA and Ca were mixed in a 1:1 ratio, so that there's no excess of either, then the concentrations of free Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA\u2074\u207b would both be very small. So the denominator [Ca\u00b2+][EDTA\u2074\u207b] would be (x)(x) = x\u00b2, where x is the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ (since EDTA's free concentration would also be x, because they react in 1:1 ratio). \n\nSo substituting into the Kf equation: 5e10 = (0.02) / (x^2). Solving for x would give the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+.\n\nLet me write that equation again:\n\nKf = [CaEDTA\u00b2\u207b]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA\u2074\u207b]) = 5e10.\n\nAssuming that [Ca\u00b2+] = [EDTA\u2074\u207b] = x, because the complex is 1:1 and the solution is stoichiometric (so initial concentrations of Ca and EDTA were equal and both reacted to form the complex, leaving only x in each free form), then:\n\n5e10 = 0.02/(x^2)\n\nSo rearranged, x^2 = 0.02/(5e10)\n\nCalculating that: 0.02 divided by 5e10 = 4e-3 / 5e10?",
