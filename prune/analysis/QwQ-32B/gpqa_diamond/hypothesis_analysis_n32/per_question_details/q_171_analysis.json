So the lower the value, the lower the para fraction.\n\nThe substances with meta directing groups (4,6,2) have the lowest (0%) para fraction.\n\nNext comes the deactivating ortho/para directing (3, Cl), which has some para (say 30%).\n\nActivating groups (1 and5) have highest (100%).\n\nThus, the order is 4=6=2 <3 <1=5.\n\nThe options don't have this, but option C has 4<6<2<1<5<3 \u2192 which places 3 after 1 and5, which is wrong.\n\nOption A has 4<2<6<3<1<5 \u2192 which after 6 comes 3 (Cl), then 1 and5. So the order is meta groups first, then Cl, then activating. That would be correct if the meta groups are ordered 4<2<6.
