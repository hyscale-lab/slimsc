Since both planets orbit the same star, the ratio would depend on their distances squared, maybe?\n\nThe problem gives me the star's mass, radius, and effective temperature. The star's mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar, and Teff 6300 K. Hmm. To find the luminosity of the star, I can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the star: L = 4\u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3Teff^4. Since both planets are around this same star, their equilibrium temperatures will depend on their distance from the star. \n\nThe question is asking for the ratio T1_eq / T2_eq. To find that, I can take the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. If I write the formula for each:\n\nT1_eq = [ (L / (16\u03c0\u03c3 a1\u00b2) ) ]^(1/4 )\n\nSimilarly for T2. When taking the ratio, the L, 16\u03c0\u03c3, and the constants will cancel out. So the ratio becomes (a2/a1)^(-1/2). Because T1/T2 = [ (a2/a1)^(-2) ]^(1/4) ?",

Since both planets orbit the same star, maybe I can use the ratio of their distances to compute the temperature ratio, considering that the albedo is the same for both.\n\nThe problem states that both planets have the same albedo, so the (1 - A)^(1/4) term would be the same for both, so they would cancel out when taking the ratio. So the main factors left are the star's properties and the orbital distance of each planet.\n\nThe question gives the star's mass and radius, but I'm not sure if those directly affect the equilibrium temperature unless they impact the luminosity. The star's luminosity can be related to its mass and radius via the Stefan-Boltzmann law for stars: L = 4\u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3T_eff^4. Since the star's Teff is given as 6300 K, we can compute its luminosity, but perhaps we don't need the exact value because it might cancel out in the ratio.\n\nThe key here is to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures, Teq1/Teq2.

The equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's orbital distance.

However, the problem doesn't give the orbital periods. \n\nHmm, but the problem states that both planets are in circular orbits. The information given for each planet is the induced Doppler shift (RV semi-amplitude) on the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5. \n\nThe problem says:\n\nPlanet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5, while Planet2 induces up to 0.04 \u00c5.\n\nThe Doppler shift is related to the radial velocity semi-amplitude K.

Since M_p << M_s, this simplifies to P^2 \u2248 (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G M_s )) a^3, so P \u221d a^(3/2). \n\nThe star's velocity K is related to the planet's orbital velocity. Since the planet orbits the star, the star's velocity v (K) is related to the planet's mass. The formula for the star's velocity is derived from the center of mass:\n\nM_s v = M_p v_p, where v and v_p are their velocities around the center of mass. \n\nThe orbital velocity of the planet is v_p = 2 \u03c0 a_p / P, where a_p is the distance from planet to star (semi-major axis). \n\nThe star's velocity v is 2 \u03c0 a_s / P, where a_s is the distance from the star to the center of mass. \n\nSince M_s a_s = M_p a_p, so a_s = (M_p / M_s) a_p. \n\nTherefore, the star's velocity v = 2 \u03c0 a_s / P = 2 \u03c0 ( (M_p a_p)/(M_s) ) / P \n\nBut since a_p is the semi-major axis of the planet, so from Kepler's third law: \n\na_p^3 = ( G (M_s + M_p) P^2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 ) \u2248 (G M_s P^2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nThus, a_p \u2248 ( (G M_s P^2 )/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 ) )^{1/3} \n\nPutting this into the expression for v:\n\nv = 2 \u03c0/(P) * ( M_p / M_s ) * a_p \n\nSubstitute a_p:\n\nv = 2 \u03c0/(P) * ( M_p / M_s ) * ( ( G M_s P^2 )/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 ) )^{1/3 } \n\nLet's simplify step by step:\n\nFirst, the term (G M_s P^2 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 ))^{1/3} can be written as ( (G M_s)^{1/3} ) * (P^{2/3} ) / ( (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} ) )\n\nSo multiplying all terms:\n\nv = [2 \u03c0 / P ] * [ M_p / M_s ] * [ (G M_s)^{1/3} (P^{2/3}) ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} ) ]\n\nLet me arrange terms:\n\nThe P terms: [2 \u03c0 / P ] * [ P^{2/3} ] = 2 \u03c0 P^{-1 + 2/3} = 2 \u03c0 P^{-1/3}\n\nThe M terms: [ M_p / M_s ] * [ (M_s)^{1/3} ] = M_p * M_s^{-2/3}\n\nThe constants: 1 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} \n\nPutting together:\n\nv = (2 \u03c0) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} ) * (M_p / M_s^{2/3}) ) * ( P^{-1/3} ) * (G^{1/3} )\n\nHmm, but perhaps I can factor the constants.

Since M_p << M_s, this simplifies to P^2 \u2248 (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G M_s )) a^3, so P \u221d a^(3/2). \n\nThe star's velocity K is related to the planet's orbital velocity. Since the planet orbits the star, the star's velocity v (K) is related to the planet's mass. The formula for the star's velocity is derived from the center of mass:\n\nM_s v = M_p v_p, where v and v_p are their velocities around the center of mass. \n\nThe orbital velocity of the planet is v_p = 2 \u03c0 a_p / P, where a_p is the distance from planet to star (semi-major axis). \n\nThe star's velocity v is 2 \u03c0 a_s / P, where a_s is the distance from the star to the center of mass. \n\nSince M_s a_s = M_p a_p, so a_s = (M_p / M_s) a_p. \n\nTherefore, the star's velocity v = 2 \u03c0 a_s / P = 2 \u03c0 ( (M_p a_p)/(M_s) ) / P \n\nBut since a_p is the semi-major axis of the planet, so from Kepler's third law: \n\na_p^3 = ( G (M_s + M_p) P^2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 ) \u2248 (G M_s P^2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nThus, a_p \u2248 ( (G M_s P^2 )/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 ) )^{1/3} \n\nPutting this into the expression for v:\n\nv = 2 \u03c0/(P) * ( M_p / M_s ) * a_p \n\nSubstitute a_p:\n\nv = 2 \u03c0/(P) * ( M_p / M_s ) * ( ( G M_s P^2 )/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 ) )^{1/3 } \n\nLet's simplify step by step:\n\nFirst, the term (G M_s P^2 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 ))^{1/3} can be written as ( (G M_s)^{1/3} ) * (P^{2/3} ) / ( (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} ) )\n\nSo multiplying all terms:\n\nv = [2 \u03c0 / P ] * [ M_p / M_s ] * [ (G M_s)^{1/3} (P^{2/3}) ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} ) ]\n\nLet me arrange terms:\n\nThe P terms: [2 \u03c0 / P ] * [ P^{2/3} ] = 2 \u03c0 P^{-1 + 2/3} = 2 \u03c0 P^{-1/3}\n\nThe M terms: [ M_p / M_s ] * [ (M_s)^{1/3} ] = M_p * M_s^{-2/3}\n\nThe constants: 1 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} \n\nPutting together:\n\nv = (2 \u03c0) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} ) * (M_p / M_s^{2/3}) ) * ( P^{-1/3} ) * (G^{1/3} )\n\nHmm, but perhaps I can factor the constants. Let's see:\n\n(2 \u03c0) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} ) = (2 \u03c0) / ( (4)^{1/3} (\u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} )) \n\n= 2 \u03c0 / ( 4^{1/3} \u03c0^{2/3} )\n\n= 2 / 4^{1/3} * \u03c0^{1 - 2/3} \n\n= 2 / 4^{1/3} * \u03c0^{1/3} \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit messy, but perhaps I can see that the velocity v (which is K, the RV semi-amplitude) is proportional to (M_p / M_s^{2/3}) * (1 / P^{1/3} ), multiplied by some constants involving G and \u03c0. \n\nSince we are looking for the ratio between Planet1 and Planet2, the constants will cancel out. Let me write the ratio K1/K2:\n\nK1/K2 = [ (M_p1 / M_s^{2/3}) / ( P1^{1/3} ) ] / [ (M_p2 / M_s^{2/3}) / ( P2^{1/3} ) ]\n\nThe M_s terms cancel, so:\n\n= ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( P2 / P1 )^{1/3 }\n\nSo rearranged:\n\nK1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * (P2 / P1)^{1/3}\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for (P2/P1)^{1/3} = (K1/K2) * (M_p2 / M_p1 )\n\nBut we need the ratio of the semi-major axes a1/a2 to compute the equilibrium temperature. \n\nBecause the equilibrium temperature depends on a (distance from star). \n\nFrom Kepler's third law, since P^2 \u221d a^3, so (P1/P2)^2 = (a1/a2)^3 \u2192 (P1/P2) = (a1/a2)^{3/2} \u2192 (a1/a2) = (P1/P2)^{2/3} \n\nSo the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is (T1/T2) = sqrt( a2/a1 ), since T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a).",

Hmm, but the problem here is that the K (radial velocity semi-amplitude) is given in terms of a Doppler shift in wavelength, not directly in velocity. So I need to convert the wavelength shift to velocity.\n\nThe Doppler shift formula relates the velocity to the wavelength shift. For small velocities compared to the speed of light (which they are here), the shift \u0394\u03bb is approximately equal to (v/c) * \u03bb0, where \u03bb0 is the rest wavelength.

The star's mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar, and Teff 6300 K. Hmm. To find the luminosity of the star, I can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the star: L = 4\u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3Teff^4.

The Doppler shift is related to the planet's orbital velocity, which depends on the orbital period and the distance. \n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K (in velocity) is given by the formula:\n\nK = (G (M_p) / (2\u03c0 G (M_* + M_p) )^{1/3}) ) * ( (sin i)^{-1} ) ) ?",
