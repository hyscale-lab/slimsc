Let me write the potential in Cartesian coordinates:\n\nV(x,y) = (1/2)k(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + (3/2)k(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)*(x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)) \n\nSimplify the second term: The (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) cancels with the denominator, so it becomes (3/2)k x\u00b2. Therefore, the total potential is:\n\nV(x,y) = (1/2)k(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + (3/2)k x\u00b2 \n\nCombine like terms: The x\u00b2 terms are (1/2 + 3/2)k x\u00b2 = 2k x\u00b2, and the y\u00b2 term is (1/2)k y\u00b2.

So in Cartesian coordinates, the potential becomes a harmonic oscillator in x and y directions, but with different spring constants. So along the x-direction, it's a harmonic oscillator with k_x = 4k (since V_x = (1/2)k_x x\u00b2 \u2192 2k x\u00b2 = (1/2)(4k)x\u00b2 ), and along the y-direction, k_y = k (since (1/2)k y\u00b2 is already the standard form).",

Let me compute each term:\n\nThe first term is (1/2)k (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). The second term is (3/2)k (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) cos\u00b2\u03b8. Since cos\u03b8 is x / r, so cos\u00b2\u03b8 = x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Therefore, the second term becomes (3/2)k (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) * (x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)) ) = (3/2)k x\u00b2. \n\nAdding the two terms together: (1/2)k (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + (3/2)k x\u00b2 = [ (1/2 k x\u00b2 + 3/2 k x\u00b2 ) ] + (1/2 k y\u00b2 )\n\nCalculating the x terms: ( (1/2 + 3/2 )k x\u00b2 ) = 2k x\u00b2. Then the y term is (1/2 k y\u00b2). Therefore, the total potential is V = 2k x\u00b2 + (1/2)k y\u00b2. So in Cartesian coordinates, this is a harmonic oscillator with different spring constants along x and y. \n\nSo the potential can be written as V(x,y) = (1/2)k (4x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Because 2k x\u00b2 is the same as (1/2)k*(4x\u00b2) and (1/2)k y\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, the potential is a 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in x and y directions.

Comparing that to our case here:\n\nFor the x-direction: 1/2 m \u03c9_x\u00b2 x\u00b2 = 2k x\u00b2 \u2192 \u03c9_x\u00b2 = (4k)/m \u2192 \u03c9_x = 2 sqrt(k/m)\n\nFor the y-direction: 1/2 m \u03c9_y\u00b2 y\u00b2 = (1/2)k y\u00b2 \u2192 \u03c9_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\nTherefore, the frequencies are different.

Let me compute each term:\n\nThe first term is (1/2)k (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). The second term is (3/2)k (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) cos\u00b2\u03b8. Since cos\u03b8 is x / r, so cos\u00b2\u03b8 = x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Therefore, the second term becomes (3/2)k (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) * (x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)) ) = (3/2)k x\u00b2. \n\nAdding the two terms together: (1/2)k (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + (3/2)k x\u00b2 = [ (1/2 k x\u00b2 + 3/2 k x\u00b2 ) ] + (1/2 k y\u00b2 )\n\nCalculating the x terms: ( (1/2 + 3/2 )k x\u00b2 ) = 2k x\u00b2. Then the y term is (1/2 k y\u00b2). Therefore, the total potential is V = 2k x\u00b2 + (1/2)k y\u00b2. So in Cartesian coordinates, this is a harmonic oscillator with different spring constants along x and y. \n\nSo the potential can be written as V(x,y) = (1/2)k (4x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Because 2k x\u00b2 is the same as (1/2)k*(4x\u00b2) and (1/2)k y\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, the potential is a 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in x and y directions. The standard 2D harmonic oscillator has V = (1/2)m\u03c9_x\u00b2 x\u00b2 + (1/2)m\u03c9_y\u00b2 y\u00b2. Comparing that to our case here:\n\nFor the x-direction: 1/2 m \u03c9_x\u00b2 x\u00b2 = 2k x\u00b2 \u2192 \u03c9_x\u00b2 = (4k)/m \u2192 \u03c9_x = 2 sqrt(k/m)\n\nFor the y-direction: 1/2 m \u03c9_y\u00b2 y\u00b2 = (1/2)k y\u00b2 \u2192 \u03c9_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\nTherefore, the frequencies are different. The energy levels for a 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies are given by:\n\nE_{n_x, n_y} = (n_x + 1/2) \u0127 \u03c9_x + (n_y + 1/2) \u0127 \u03c9_y\n\nSubstituting \u03c9_x = 2 sqrt(k/m) and \u03c9_y = sqrt(k/m):\n\nE = (n_x + 1/2) \u0127 * 2 sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) \u0127 sqrt(k/m)\n\nFactor out \u0127 sqrt(k/m):\n\nE = \u0127 sqrt(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ]\n\nLet me compute the terms inside:\n\n2(n_x + 1/2) = 2n_x +1 \n\nand (n_y +1/2) is as is.

However, since V(r,\u03b8) has terms that depend on both r and \u03b8 (like cos\u00b2\u03b8 multiplied by r\u00b2), this complicates things. Unless the angular equation can be separated with terms involving r\u00b2, but that might not lead to a straightforward solution.",

Let me write the potential in Cartesian coordinates:\n\nV(x,y) = (1/2)k(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + (3/2)k(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)*(x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)) \n\nSimplify the second term: The (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) cancels with the denominator, so it becomes (3/2)k x\u00b2. Therefore, the total potential is:\n\nV(x,y) = (1/2)k(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + (3/2)k x\u00b2 \n\nCombine like terms: The x\u00b2 terms are (1/2 + 3/2)k x\u00b2 = 2k x\u00b2, and the y\u00b2 term is (1/2)k y\u00b2.

So in Cartesian coordinates, the potential becomes a harmonic oscillator in x and y directions, but with different spring constants. So along the x-direction, it's a harmonic oscillator with k_x = 4k (since V_x = (1/2)k_x x\u00b2 \u2192 2k x\u00b2 = (1/2)(4k)x\u00b2 ), and along the y-direction, k_y = k (since (1/2)k y\u00b2 is already the standard form).",

Let me compute each term:\n\nThe first term is (1/2)k (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). The second term is (3/2)k (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) cos\u00b2\u03b8. Since cos\u03b8 is x / r, so cos\u00b2\u03b8 = x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Therefore, the second term becomes (3/2)k (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) * (x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)) ) = (3/2)k x\u00b2. \n\nAdding the two terms together: (1/2)k (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + (3/2)k x\u00b2 = [ (1/2 k x\u00b2 + 3/2 k x\u00b2 ) ] + (1/2 k y\u00b2 )\n\nCalculating the x terms: ( (1/2 + 3/2 )k x\u00b2 ) = 2k x\u00b2. Then the y term is (1/2 k y\u00b2). Therefore, the total potential is V = 2k x\u00b2 + (1/2)k y\u00b2. So in Cartesian coordinates, this is a harmonic oscillator with different spring constants along x and y. \n\nSo the potential can be written as V(x,y) = (1/2)k (4x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Because 2k x\u00b2 is the same as (1/2)k*(4x\u00b2) and (1/2)k y\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, the potential is a 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in x and y directions.

Comparing that to our case here:\n\nFor the x-direction: 1/2 m \u03c9_x\u00b2 x\u00b2 = 2k x\u00b2 \u2192 \u03c9_x\u00b2 = (4k)/m \u2192 \u03c9_x = 2 sqrt(k/m)\n\nFor the y-direction: 1/2 m \u03c9_y\u00b2 y\u00b2 = (1/2)k y\u00b2 \u2192 \u03c9_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\nTherefore, the frequencies are different.

Since cos\u03b8 is x / r, so cos\u00b2\u03b8 = x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Therefore, the second term becomes (3/2)k (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) * (x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)) ) = (3/2)k x\u00b2. \n\nAdding the two terms together: (1/2)k (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + (3/2)k x\u00b2 = [ (1/2 k x\u00b2 + 3/2 k x\u00b2 ) ] + (1/2 k y\u00b2 )\n\nCalculating the x terms: ( (1/2 + 3/2 )k x\u00b2 ) = 2k x\u00b2. Then the y term is (1/2 k y\u00b2). Therefore, the total potential is V = 2k x\u00b2 + (1/2)k y\u00b2. So in Cartesian coordinates, this is a harmonic oscillator with different spring constants along x and y. \n\nSo the potential can be written as V(x,y) = (1/2)k (4x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Because 2k x\u00b2 is the same as (1/2)k*(4x\u00b2) and (1/2)k y\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, the potential is a 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in x and y directions. The standard 2D harmonic oscillator has V = (1/2)m\u03c9_x\u00b2 x\u00b2 + (1/2)m\u03c9_y\u00b2 y\u00b2. Comparing that to our case here:\n\nFor the x-direction: 1/2 m \u03c9_x\u00b2 x\u00b2 = 2k x\u00b2 \u2192 \u03c9_x\u00b2 = (4k)/m \u2192 \u03c9_x = 2 sqrt(k/m)\n\nFor the y-direction: 1/2 m \u03c9_y\u00b2 y\u00b2 = (1/2)k y\u00b2 \u2192 \u03c9_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\nTherefore, the frequencies are different. The energy levels for a 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies are given by:\n\nE_{n_x, n_y} = (n_x + 1/2) \u0127 \u03c9_x + (n_y + 1/2) \u0127 \u03c9_y\n\nSubstituting \u03c9_x = 2 sqrt(k/m) and \u03c9_y = sqrt(k/m):\n\nE = (n_x + 1/2) \u0127 * 2 sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) \u0127 sqrt(k/m)\n\nFactor out \u0127 sqrt(k/m):\n\nE = \u0127 sqrt(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ]\n\nLet me compute the terms inside:\n\n2(n_x + 1/2) = 2n_x +1 \n\nand (n_y +1/2) is as is.

Cos\u03b8 is x/r, so cos\u00b2\u03b8 is x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). So when multiplied by r\u00b2, that term becomes (3/2)k x\u00b2.

Since r\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2, and cos\u03b8 = x/r, so cos\u00b2\u03b8 = x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).

Yes! So in Cartesian coordinates, the potential is V(x,y) = 2k x\u00b2 + (k/2) y\u00b2. \n\nAh, that's much simpler. So the potential is a harmonic oscillator in x and y directions with different spring constants. The x-direction has a spring constant of 2k, and the y-direction has a spring constant of (k/2). \n\nTherefore, the system is separable into two independent harmonic oscillators, one in x and one in y. The energy levels of a 1D harmonic oscillator are (n + 1/2) \u210f\u03c9, where \u03c9 = sqrt(k/m). \n\nSo for the x-direction, the angular frequency \u03c9_x = sqrt( (2k)/m ), since the spring constant is 2k. Similarly, the y-direction has \u03c9_y = sqrt( (k/2)/m ) = sqrt(k/(2m)). \n\nTherefore, the total energy is the sum of the x and y energies.

Since cos\u03b8 is x / r, so cos\u00b2\u03b8 = x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Therefore, the second term becomes (3/2)k (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) * (x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)) ) = (3/2)k x\u00b2. \n\nAdding the two terms together: (1/2)k (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + (3/2)k x\u00b2 = [ (1/2 k x\u00b2 + 3/2 k x\u00b2 ) ] + (1/2 k y\u00b2 )\n\nCalculating the x terms: ( (1/2 + 3/2 )k x\u00b2 ) = 2k x\u00b2. Then the y term is (1/2 k y\u00b2). Therefore, the total potential is V = 2k x\u00b2 + (1/2)k y\u00b2. So in Cartesian coordinates, this is a harmonic oscillator with different spring constants along x and y. \n\nSo the potential can be written as V(x,y) = (1/2)k (4x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Because 2k x\u00b2 is the same as (1/2)k*(4x\u00b2) and (1/2)k y\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, the potential is a 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in x and y directions. The standard 2D harmonic oscillator has V = (1/2)m\u03c9_x\u00b2 x\u00b2 + (1/2)m\u03c9_y\u00b2 y\u00b2. Comparing that to our case here:\n\nFor the x-direction: 1/2 m \u03c9_x\u00b2 x\u00b2 = 2k x\u00b2 \u2192 \u03c9_x\u00b2 = (4k)/m \u2192 \u03c9_x = 2 sqrt(k/m)\n\nFor the y-direction: 1/2 m \u03c9_y\u00b2 y\u00b2 = (1/2)k y\u00b2 \u2192 \u03c9_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\nTherefore, the frequencies are different. The energy levels for a 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies are given by:\n\nE_{n_x, n_y} = (n_x + 1/2) \u0127 \u03c9_x + (n_y + 1/2) \u0127 \u03c9_y\n\nSubstituting \u03c9_x = 2 sqrt(k/m) and \u03c9_y = sqrt(k/m):\n\nE = (n_x + 1/2) \u0127 * 2 sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) \u0127 sqrt(k/m)\n\nFactor out \u0127 sqrt(k/m):\n\nE = \u0127 sqrt(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ]\n\nLet me compute the terms inside:\n\n2(n_x + 1/2) = 2n_x +1 \n\nand (n_y +1/2) is as is.

Since r\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2, and cos\u03b8 = x/r, so cos\u00b2\u03b8 = x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).

So adding that to the first term (1/2 kr\u00b2):\n\nTotal V = (1/2)(k(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)) + (3/2k x\u00b2) = (1/2k x\u00b2 + 1/2k y\u00b2) + 3/2k x\u00b2 = ( (1/2 + 3/2)k x\u00b2 ) + (1/2 k y\u00b2) ) = 2k x\u00b2 + (1/2 k) y\u00b2. Yes! So in Cartesian coordinates, the potential is V(x,y) = 2k x\u00b2 + (k/2) y\u00b2. \n\nAh, that's much simpler. So the potential is a harmonic oscillator in x and y directions with different spring constants. The x-direction has a spring constant of 2k, and the y-direction has a spring constant of (k/2). \n\nTherefore, the system is separable into two independent harmonic oscillators, one in x and one in y. The energy levels of a 1D harmonic oscillator are (n + 1/2) \u210f\u03c9, where \u03c9 = sqrt(k/m). \n\nSo for the x-direction, the angular frequency \u03c9_x = sqrt( (2k)/m ), since the spring constant is 2k. Similarly, the y-direction has \u03c9_y = sqrt( (k/2)/m ) = sqrt(k/(2m)). \n\nTherefore, the total energy is the sum of the x and y energies. Let me compute each:\n\nE_x = (n_x + 1/2) \u210f \u03c9_x = (n_x + 1/2) \u210f sqrt(2k/m)\n\nE_y = (n_y + 1/2) \u210f \u03c9_y = (n_y + 1/2) \u210f sqrt(k/(2m))\n\nSo total energy E = E_x + E_y = \u210f sqrt(k/m) [ (n_x + 1/2) sqrt(2) + (n_y + 1/2)/sqrt(2) ]\n\nHmm, maybe factor sqrt(k/m) and combine terms. Let me see:\n\nLet me factor out sqrt(k/m) from both terms. Let me write sqrt(2) as sqrt(2/1). Let me see:\n\nsqrt(2k/m) = sqrt(2) * sqrt(k/m), so that term is (n_x + 1/2) \u210f sqrt(2) sqrt(k/m). Similarly, sqrt(k/(2m)) is sqrt(1/2)*sqrt(k/m). So the second term is (n_y + 1/2) \u210f (1/sqrt(2)) sqrt(k/m). \n\nTherefore, E = \u210f sqrt(k/m) [ (n_x + 1/2) sqrt(2) + (n_y + 1/2)/sqrt(2) ]\n\nHmm, perhaps to combine these terms, let's multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(2) to rationalize.",

Adding the x\u00b2 terms: (1/2 + 3/2)k x\u00b2 = 2k x\u00b2. The y term is 1/2k y\u00b2. So V(x,y) = 2k x\u00b2 + (k/2)y\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, the potential is a harmonic oscillator in both x and y directions but with different spring constants.

So in Cartesian coordinates, this is a harmonic oscillator with different spring constants along x and y. \n\nSo the potential can be written as V(x,y) = (1/2)k (4x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).

So in Cartesian coordinates, this is a harmonic oscillator with different spring constants along x and y. \n\nSo the potential can be written as V(x,y) = (1/2)k (4x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Because 2k x\u00b2 is the same as (1/2)k*(4x\u00b2) and (1/2)k y\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, the potential is a 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in x and y directions. The standard 2D harmonic oscillator has V = (1/2)m\u03c9_x\u00b2 x\u00b2 + (1/2)m\u03c9_y\u00b2 y\u00b2. Comparing that to our case here:\n\nFor the x-direction: 1/2 m \u03c9_x\u00b2 x\u00b2 = 2k x\u00b2 \u2192 \u03c9_x\u00b2 = (4k)/m \u2192 \u03c9_x = 2 sqrt(k/m)\n\nFor the y-direction: 1/2 m \u03c9_y\u00b2 y\u00b2 = (1/2)k y\u00b2 \u2192 \u03c9_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\nTherefore, the frequencies are different. The energy levels for a 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies are given by:\n\nE_{n_x, n_y} = (n_x + 1/2) \u0127 \u03c9_x + (n_y + 1/2) \u0127 \u03c9_y\n\nSubstituting \u03c9_x = 2 sqrt(k/m) and \u03c9_y = sqrt(k/m):\n\nE = (n_x + 1/2) \u0127 * 2 sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) \u0127 sqrt(k/m)\n\nFactor out \u0127 sqrt(k/m):\n\nE = \u0127 sqrt(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ]\n\nLet me compute the terms inside:\n\n2(n_x + 1/2) = 2n_x +1 \n\nand (n_y +1/2) is as is. Adding them:\n\n2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 \n\nSo the total energy is (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) \u0127 sqrt(k/m). \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C is E = (2n_x +n_y + 3/2) \u210f*sqrt(k/m). That matches exactly.",

Since r\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2, and cos\u03b8 = x/r, so cos\u00b2\u03b8 = x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Multiply that by (3/2)kr\u00b2:\n\n(3/2 k r\u00b2)(x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)) = (3/2k x\u00b2). So adding that to the first term (1/2 kr\u00b2):\n\nTotal V = (1/2)(k(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)) + (3/2k x\u00b2) = (1/2k x\u00b2 + 1/2k y\u00b2) + 3/2k x\u00b2 = ( (1/2 + 3/2)k x\u00b2 ) + (1/2 k y\u00b2) ) = 2k x\u00b2 + (1/2 k) y\u00b2. Yes! So in Cartesian coordinates, the potential is V(x,y) = 2k x\u00b2 + (k/2) y\u00b2. \n\nAh, that's much simpler. So the potential is a harmonic oscillator in x and y directions with different spring constants. The x-direction has a spring constant of 2k, and the y-direction has a spring constant of (k/2). \n\nTherefore, the system is separable into two independent harmonic oscillators, one in x and one in y. The energy levels of a 1D harmonic oscillator are (n + 1/2) \u210f\u03c9, where \u03c9 = sqrt(k/m). \n\nSo for the x-direction, the angular frequency \u03c9_x = sqrt( (2k)/m ), since the spring constant is 2k. Similarly, the y-direction has \u03c9_y = sqrt( (k/2)/m ) = sqrt(k/(2m)). \n\nTherefore, the total energy is the sum of the x and y energies. Let me compute each:\n\nE_x = (n_x + 1/2) \u210f \u03c9_x = (n_x + 1/2) \u210f sqrt(2k/m)\n\nE_y = (n_y + 1/2) \u210f \u03c9_y = (n_y + 1/2) \u210f sqrt(k/(2m))\n\nSo total energy E = E_x + E_y = \u210f sqrt(k/m) [ (n_x + 1/2) sqrt(2) + (n_y + 1/2)/sqrt(2) ]\n\nHmm, maybe factor sqrt(k/m) and combine terms. Let me see:\n\nLet me factor out sqrt(k/m) from both terms. Let me write sqrt(2) as sqrt(2/1). Let me see:\n\nsqrt(2k/m) = sqrt(2) * sqrt(k/m), so that term is (n_x + 1/2) \u210f sqrt(2) sqrt(k/m). Similarly, sqrt(k/(2m)) is sqrt(1/2)*sqrt(k/m). So the second term is (n_y + 1/2) \u210f (1/sqrt(2)) sqrt(k/m). \n\nTherefore, E = \u210f sqrt(k/m) [ (n_x + 1/2) sqrt(2) + (n_y + 1/2)/sqrt(2) ]\n\nHmm, perhaps to combine these terms, let's multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(2) to rationalize.",
          "text2": "Wait, let's see. Let me check that again. \n\nOriginal potential in polar coordinates was (1/2)kr\u00b2 + (3/2)kr\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8. Converting to Cartesian coordinates:\n\nFirst term is (1/2)k (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). The second term is (3/2)k r\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8 = (3/2)k (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2/(x\u00b2+y\u00b2)) ) = (3/2)k x\u00b2. So total V is (1/2k x\u00b2 + 1/2k y\u00b2) + 3/2k x\u00b2. Adding the x\u00b2 terms: (1/2 + 3/2)k x\u00b2 = 2k x\u00b2. The y term is 1/2k y\u00b2. So V(x,y) = 2k x\u00b2 + (k/2)y\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, the potential is a harmonic oscillator in both x and y directions but with different spring constants. Specifically, along x-direction, the potential is 2k x\u00b2, which can be written as (1/2) * (4k) x\u00b2. Similarly, the y-direction potential is (k/2) y\u00b2 = (1/2) * (k) y\u00b2. \n\nSo the Hamiltonian in each direction will be that of a harmonic oscillator. The energy levels for a harmonic oscillator in 1D are (n + 1/2) \u210f \u03c9, where \u03c9 = sqrt(k/m). \n\nTherefore, for the x-direction here, the spring constant is 4k, so \u03c9_x = sqrt( (4k)/m ) = 2 sqrt(k/m). \n\nSimilarly, the y-direction has spring constant k, so \u03c9_y = sqrt(k/m). \n\nTherefore, the energy in each direction is:\n\nE_x = (n_x + 1/2) \u210f \u03c9_x = (n_x + 1/2) \u210f * 2 sqrt(k/m)\n\nE_y = (n_y + 1/2) \u210f \u03c9_y = (n_y + 1/2) \u210f sqrt(k/m)\n\nTotal energy E = E_x + E_y. \n\nSo substituting those expressions:\n\nE = (n_x + 1/2)*2 \u210f sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)* \u210f sqrt(k/m)\n\nLet me factor out \u210f sqrt(k/m):\n\nE = \u210f sqrt(k/m) [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ]\n\nExpanding the terms inside the brackets:\n\n2n_x + 1 + n_y + 0.5 = 2n_x + n_y + 1.5",

Since cos\u03b8 is x / r, so cos\u00b2\u03b8 = x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Therefore, the second term becomes (3/2)k (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) * (x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)) ) = (3/2)k x\u00b2. \n\nAdding the two terms together: (1/2)k (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + (3/2)k x\u00b2 = [ (1/2 k x\u00b2 + 3/2 k x\u00b2 ) ] + (1/2 k y\u00b2 )\n\nCalculating the x terms: ( (1/2 + 3/2 )k x\u00b2 ) = 2k x\u00b2. Then the y term is (1/2 k y\u00b2). Therefore, the total potential is V = 2k x\u00b2 + (1/2)k y\u00b2. So in Cartesian coordinates, this is a harmonic oscillator with different spring constants along x and y. \n\nSo the potential can be written as V(x,y) = (1/2)k (4x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Because 2k x\u00b2 is the same as (1/2)k*(4x\u00b2) and (1/2)k y\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, the potential is a 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in x and y directions. The standard 2D harmonic oscillator has V = (1/2)m\u03c9_x\u00b2 x\u00b2 + (1/2)m\u03c9_y\u00b2 y\u00b2. Comparing that to our case here:\n\nFor the x-direction: 1/2 m \u03c9_x\u00b2 x\u00b2 = 2k x\u00b2 \u2192 \u03c9_x\u00b2 = (4k)/m \u2192 \u03c9_x = 2 sqrt(k/m)\n\nFor the y-direction: 1/2 m \u03c9_y\u00b2 y\u00b2 = (1/2)k y\u00b2 \u2192 \u03c9_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\nTherefore, the frequencies are different.
