The key here is to compute the gamma factor based on the speed given (0.96c), then multiply by the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus.\n\nSo first, let's get the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Let me recall that Li-6 has a mass of approximately 6.015122 atomic mass units (u). I think that's the standard value. Let me confirm: yes, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.015122 u. But since this is a nucleus, the atomic mass includes electrons. For a neutral atom of Li-6, there are 3 electrons (since atomic number 3), so the mass of the nucleus would be the atomic mass minus the mass of 3 electrons. The electron mass is about 0.00054858 u each. So 3 electrons would be 0.00164574 u. Therefore, the nuclear mass would be approximately 6.015122 - 0.00164574 \u2248 6.013476 u.

Hmm, maybe the problem expects using the atomic mass because that's standard in these problems unless stated otherwise. Let me note that the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0151229 u. \n\nNext, the energy of a relativistic particle is given by the relativistic energy equation. The total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy. The formula is E = \u03b3 * m c\u00b2, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor \u03b3 is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Since v is 0.96c, then v/c = 0.96. Plugging that in, the denominator becomes sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). Let me calculate that first. \n\nCalculating 0.96 squared: 0.96 * 0.96 = 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... sqrt(0.0784) = approximately 0.28. Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. Therefore, gamma is 1 / 0.28 \u2248 3.571428...",

Gamma was 1/(sqrt(1 - 0.96\u00b2)) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) =1/0.28=3.57142857...\n\nSo multiply 5.60305 GeV by 3.57142857...\n\nCalculating that:\n\nFirst, 5.60305 *3.57142857. Let's see:\n\n3.57142857 is approximately 25/7 (since 25 divided by 7 is ~3.57142857).\n\nSo if I do 5.60305 multiplied by 25/7, that's (5.60305 *25)/7.\n\n5.60305 *25 = let's see: 5 *25=125, 0.60305*25=15.07625.

So, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus would be the atomic mass minus the mass of 3 electrons. \n\nThe mass of an electron is about 0.00054858 u per electron. \n\nSo, 3 electrons would be 3 * 0.00054858 u \u2248 0.00164574 u. \n\nTherefore, the nuclear mass is 6.01512256 u - 0.00164574 u = 6.01347682 u. \n\nConverting that to MeV/c\u00b2:\n\n6.01347682 u * 931.494 MeV/u \u2248 Let's compute that again.\n\nFirst, the 6 u part: 6 *931.494 = 5588.964 MeV.\n\nThe 0.01347682 u part: \n\n0.01 u is 0.01 *931.494 = 9.31494 MeV.\n\nThe remaining 0.00347682 u is 0.00347682 *931.494 \u2248 approx 3.24 MeV (since 0.003*931=2.793, plus 0.00047682*931\u22480.444, total 3.237).\n\nSo total for the decimal part: 9.31494 +3.237 \u2248 12.5519 MeV.\n\nTotal nuclear mass energy: 5588.964 +12.5519 \u2248 5601.5159 MeV, which is approximately 5.6015 GeV.\n\nHmm, so the nuclear mass is about 5.6015 GeV. Then the total energy would be gamma * 5.6015 GeV.\n\nGamma is still 1/(sqrt(1 - 0.96^2)) = 1/0.28 \u22483.57142857.\n\nSo 3.57142857 *5.6015 GeV.

          "text2": "Wait, maybe the problem is that the question refers to the nucleus, not the atom. The atomic mass includes electrons. But lithium has 3 electrons, so the nuclear mass would be the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass. \n\nAh, right! Because the nucleus doesn't include the electrons. So the atomic mass is the mass of the nucleus plus the electrons. Therefore, to get the nuclear mass, I have to subtract the mass of the electrons. \n\nSo for lithium-6, the atomic mass is 6.015122859 u. The nucleus has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The electrons are 3 electrons. So each electron is about 0.00054858 u (since electron mass is ~0.511 MeV/c\u00b2, and 1 u is 931.5 MeV/c\u00b2, so 0.511/931.5 \u22480.00054858 u). \n\nSo three electrons would be 3 *0.00054858 \u22480.0016457 u. \n\nTherefore, the nuclear mass is the atomic mass minus the electrons:\n\n6.015122859 u - 0.0016457 u \u22486.013477 u. \n\nAh, so that changes the rest mass energy.

Maybe the question expects us to use the mass as mass number multiplied by the proton mass (938 MeV/c\u00b2) instead of the actual atomic mass. Because 938 MeV/c\u00b2 is roughly the proton mass (proton mass is ~938 MeV/c\u00b2), but the neutron is a bit heavier. But for a rough calculation, sometimes people approximate the nucleon mass as 938 MeV/c\u00b2. So if we do that:\n\nTotal mass of Li-6 nucleus (6 nucleons) is 6 *938 =5628 MeV/c\u00b2 =5.628 GeV/c\u00b2. \n\nThen, E = gamma * m c\u00b2 =3.57142857 *5.628 \u2248?\n\n3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285\n\n3.57142857 *0.628 = ?\n\n0.6 *3.57142857 =2.14285714\n\n0.028*3.57142857 \u22480.100.\n\nTotal is 2.14285714 +0.100 =2.24285714.\n\nAdding to 17.85714285 gives 20.1 GeV. \n\nSo with this approximation, we get 20.1 GeV, which matches option C (20.132 GeV). The difference between 5.628 vs 5.6015 gives a slightly higher energy. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the question expects this approximation. The problem states \"precision of the energy is at 1e-4\". If the correct answer is 20.132, which is option C, then this approach would be needed.",

But using 938:\n\nMass of Li-6 nucleus is 6 *938 =5628 MeV/c\u00b2 (\u22485.628 GeV). Then total energy would be gamma *5.628 GeV.\n\nGamma is 25/7 \u22483.5714.

If the question expects us to approximate the mass as the mass number times the proton mass (or nucleon mass), then that's the calculation. Let's see:\n\nUsing m = 6 * (mass of a nucleon). If we take the nucleon mass as approximately 938 MeV/c\u00b2 (since protons and neutrons are roughly that), then:\n\nm c\u00b2 =6 *938 =5,628 MeV =5.628 GeV.\n\nGamma is 25/7 \u22483.57142857.\n\nTotal energy E = 3.5714 *5.628 \u224820.1 GeV.

So perhaps the question expects this approximation instead of using the exact atomic mass.\n\nSo maybe the problem assumes that the mass is mass number (A) times the nucleon mass (approx 938 MeV/c\u00b2) and ignores the electron mass.

Since 0.5714285714 is 4/7, so 3 +4/7 =25/7. So 25/7 *5.628.\n\n25/7 *5.628 = (25 *5.628)/7.\n\n25 *5.628 = 140.7 \u2192 divided by 7: 140.7/7=20.1 exactly. So that's exactly 20.1 GeV. So if the question uses 6 *938 MeV, then the answer is 20.1, which is option C (20.132). The given option is 20.132, which is very close. Maybe the actual nucleon mass is a bit higher? Let me see:\n\nSuppose the average nucleon mass in Li-6 is slightly more than 938. Let's say 939 MeV. 6*939 =5634 MeV \u21925.634 GeV. Then 3.5714 *5.634 = ?\n\n3.5714 *5.634: \n\n3.5714 *5 =17.857\n\n3.5714 *0.634 \u22483.5714*(0.6 +0.034)=3.5714*0.6=2.14284 +3.5714*0.034\u22480.1214 \u2192 total 2.26424. So total 17.857+2.264\u224820.121, which is ~20.12 GeV. Close to 20.132. Hmm, perhaps the question uses a slightly different mass.",
          "text2": "Alternatively, maybe the problem uses 938 MeV per nucleon as an approximation for the mass?\n\nIf each nucleon is 938 MeV/c\u00b2, then the nucleus with 6 nucleons would be 6*938 =5628 MeV =5.628 GeV.\n\nThen E=5.628 *3.57142857\u2248?\n\n5.628 *3.57142857= Let's calculate:\n\n5*3.57142857=17.85714285.\n\n0.628 *3.57142857 \u22480.6*3.5714=2.142857, plus 0.028*3.5714\u22480.100.

Maybe the question expects us to use the mass as mass number multiplied by the proton mass (938 MeV/c\u00b2) instead of the actual atomic mass. Because 938 MeV/c\u00b2 is roughly the proton mass (proton mass is ~938 MeV/c\u00b2), but the neutron is a bit heavier. But for a rough calculation, sometimes people approximate the nucleon mass as 938 MeV/c\u00b2. So if we do that:\n\nTotal mass of Li-6 nucleus (6 nucleons) is 6 *938 =5628 MeV/c\u00b2 =5.628 GeV/c\u00b2. \n\nThen, E = gamma * m c\u00b2 =3.57142857 *5.628 \u2248?\n\n3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285\n\n3.57142857 *0.628 = ?\n\n0.6 *3.57142857 =2.14285714\n\n0.028*3.57142857 \u22480.100.\n\nTotal is 2.14285714 +0.100 =2.24285714.\n\nAdding to 17.85714285 gives 20.1 GeV. \n\nSo with this approximation, we get 20.1 GeV, which matches option C (20.132 GeV). The difference between 5.628 vs 5.6015 gives a slightly higher energy. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the question expects this approximation. The problem states \"precision of the energy is at 1e-4\". If the correct answer is 20.132, which is option C, then this approach would be needed.",

Let me try that.\n\nUsing 6.0151229 u as the mass (atomic mass):\n\nm c\u00b2 =6.0151229 *931.494 = let's recalculate precisely:\n\n6.0151229 *931.494:\n\nCompute 6 *931.494 =5588.964\n\n0.0151229 *931.494. \n\nBreaking down 0.0151229:\n\n0.01 +0.005 +0.0001229.\n\n0.01 *931.494 =9.31494\n\n0.005 *931.494=4.65747\n\n0.0001229 *931.494\u22480.1144 as before.\n\nTotal for the decimal part: 9.31494 +4.65747 =13.97241 +0.1144\u224814.0868.\n\nTotal m c\u00b2 =5588.964 +14.0868=5603.0508 MeV =5.6030508 GeV.\n\nMultiply by gamma (25/7):\n\n5.6030508 * (25/7) = (5.6030508 *25)/7.\n\n5.6030508 *25 = 140.07627.\n\nDivide by7: 140.07627 /7 =20.010895 GeV. \n\nSo ~20.0109 GeV. So, the options given are:\n\nC)20.132, which is 20.132. The difference between 20.01 and 20.13 is about 0.12 GeV. That's significant. Perhaps I made a mistake here.",

Perhaps the question uses the neutron mass and proton mass precisely and calculates the exact average.\n\nLet me compute precisely with protons and neutrons:\n\nProton mass: ~938.272 MeV/c\u00b2\n\nNeutron mass: ~939.565 MeV/c\u00b2\n\nTotal mass of Li-6 nucleus (3 protons +3 neutrons):\n\n3*(938.272) +3*(939.565) =3*938.272=2814.816 +3*939.565=2818.695 \u2192 total 2814.816 +2818.695 =5633.511 MeV.\n\nThen gamma is 3.57142857, so total energy:\n\n5633.511 *3.57142857 \u2248?\n\n5633.511 \u00d73.57142857 = (5633.511 \u00d725)/7.\n\n5633.511 \u00d725 =140,837.775.\n\nDivide by7: 140,837.775/7 \u224820,119.682 MeV \u219220.1197 GeV \u224820.12 GeV.\n\nStill, that rounds to 20.12, but the option is 20.132.

Oh, that's exactly option C (20.132). The slight difference is due to rounding.\n\nAh! So perhaps the question uses the neutron mass for each nucleon.

So nuclear mass is 6.015122892 -0.00164574 =6.013477152 u.\n\nConverting this to MeV/c\u00b2:\n\n6.013477152 *931.494061 = ?\n\nLet me compute 6 *931.494061 =5588.964366\n\n0.013477152 *931.494061:\n\n0.01 *931.494061 =9.31494061\n\n0.003477152 *931.494061:\n\n0.003 *931.494061=2.79448218\n\n0.000477152 *931.494061 \u22480.4446\n\nTotal for 0.003477152: 2.794482 +0.4446 \u22483.23908\n\nAdding to the 9.31494 gives 9.31494+3.23908=12.55402.\n\nTotal nuclear mass energy: 5588.964366 +12.55402\u22485601.51839 MeV \u22485.6015 GeV.\n\nThen gamma is 3.571428571. So total energy is 3.571428571 *5.6015 \u2248?\n\n3.571428571 *5 =17.85714286\n\n3.571428571 *0.6015 = ?\n\n3.571428571 *0.6 =2.142857143\n\n3.571428571 *0.0015 =0.005357142857\n\nTotal: 2.142857143 +0.005357 \u22482.148214\n\nAdding to 17.857 gives 17.85714 +2.148214 =20.00535 GeV.\n\nHmm, so still about 20.005 GeV.

The key here is to compute the gamma factor based on the speed given (0.96c), then multiply by the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus.\n\nSo first, let's get the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Let me recall that Li-6 has a mass of approximately 6.015122 atomic mass units (u). I think that's the standard value. Let me confirm: yes, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.015122 u. But since this is a nucleus, the atomic mass includes electrons. For a neutral atom of Li-6, there are 3 electrons (since atomic number 3), so the mass of the nucleus would be the atomic mass minus the mass of 3 electrons. The electron mass is about 0.00054858 u each. So 3 electrons would be 0.00164574 u. Therefore, the nuclear mass would be approximately 6.015122 - 0.00164574 \u2248 6.013476 u.

Let me note that the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0151229 u. \n\nNext, the energy of a relativistic particle is given by the relativistic energy equation. The total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy. The formula is E = \u03b3 * m c\u00b2, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor \u03b3 is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).

Since the given atomic mass includes the electrons, but the nucleus doesn't have those electrons. So, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus would be the atomic mass minus the mass of 3 electrons. \n\nThe mass of an electron is about 0.00054858 u per electron. \n\nSo, 3 electrons would be 3 * 0.00054858 u \u2248 0.00164574 u. \n\nTherefore, the nuclear mass is 6.01512256 u - 0.00164574 u = 6.01347682 u. \n\nConverting that to MeV/c\u00b2:\n\n6.01347682 u * 931.494 MeV/u \u2248 Let's compute that again.\n\nFirst, the 6 u part: 6 *931.494 = 5588.964 MeV.\n\nThe 0.01347682 u part: \n\n0.01 u is 0.01 *931.494 = 9.31494 MeV.\n\nThe remaining 0.00347682 u is 0.00347682 *931.494 \u2248 approx 3.24 MeV (since 0.003*931=2.793, plus 0.00047682*931\u22480.444, total 3.237).\n\nSo total for the decimal part: 9.31494 +3.237 \u2248 12.5519 MeV.\n\nTotal nuclear mass energy: 5588.964 +12.5519 \u2248 5601.5159 MeV, which is approximately 5.6015 GeV.\n\nHmm, so the nuclear mass is about 5.6015 GeV.

So the atomic mass is the mass of the nucleus plus the electrons. Therefore, to get the nuclear mass, I have to subtract the mass of the electrons. \n\nSo for lithium-6, the atomic mass is 6.015122859 u. The nucleus has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The electrons are 3 electrons. So each electron is about 0.00054858 u (since electron mass is ~0.511 MeV/c\u00b2, and 1 u is 931.5 MeV/c\u00b2, so 0.511/931.5 \u22480.00054858 u). \n\nSo three electrons would be 3 *0.00054858 \u22480.0016457 u. \n\nTherefore, the nuclear mass is the atomic mass minus the electrons:\n\n6.015122859 u - 0.0016457 u \u22486.013477 u. \n\nAh, so that changes the rest mass energy.

Let me see:\n\nThe mass of an electron is about 0.00054858 u. So three electrons would add 0.0016457 u. So the nuclear mass would be atomic mass minus electrons' mass. \n\nSo nuclear mass = 6.0151229 u - 3*(electron mass). \n\nElectron mass is approximately 0.00054858 u.

So the atomic mass is the mass of the nucleus plus the electrons.

The electrons are 3 electrons. So each electron is about 0.00054858 u (since electron mass is ~0.511 MeV/c\u00b2, and 1 u is 931.5 MeV/c\u00b2, so 0.511/931.5 \u22480.00054858 u). \n\nSo three electrons would be 3 *0.00054858 \u22480.0016457 u. \n\nTherefore, the nuclear mass is the atomic mass minus the electrons:\n\n6.015122859 u - 0.0016457 u \u22486.013477 u. \n\nAh, so that changes the rest mass energy.

So if we do that:\n\nTotal mass of Li-6 nucleus (6 nucleons) is 6 *938 =5628 MeV/c\u00b2 =5.628 GeV/c\u00b2. \n\nThen, E = gamma * m c\u00b2 =3.57142857 *5.628 \u2248?\n\n3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285\n\n3.57142857 *0.628 = ?\n\n0.6 *3.57142857 =2.14285714\n\n0.028*3.57142857 \u22480.100.\n\nTotal is 2.14285714 +0.100 =2.24285714.\n\nAdding to 17.85714285 gives 20.1 GeV. \n\nSo with this approximation, we get 20.1 GeV, which matches option C (20.132 GeV). The difference between 5.628 vs 5.6015 gives a slightly higher energy. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the question expects this approximation. The problem states \"precision of the energy is at 1e-4\". If the correct answer is 20.132, which is option C, then this approach would be needed.",
          "text2": "Alternatively, perhaps I should use the mass of the nucleus as the mass number times the nucleon mass, but that would be an approximation. Let's see:\n\nThe mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c\u00b2 (proton is ~938, neutron about 939). But using 938:\n\nMass of Li-6 nucleus is 6 *938 =5628 MeV/c\u00b2 (\u22485.628 GeV). Then total energy would be gamma *5.628 GeV.\n\nGamma is 25/7 \u22483.5714. So 3.5714 *5.628 \u22483.5714 *5 =17.857, plus 3.5714*0.628 \u22482.243. Total is ~20.1 GeV. Which is close to option C (20.132).\n\nAh! This might be the reason. If the question expects us to approximate the mass as the mass number times the proton mass (or nucleon mass), then that's the calculation. Let's see:\n\nUsing m = 6 * (mass of a nucleon). If we take the nucleon mass as approximately 938 MeV/c\u00b2 (since protons and neutrons are roughly that), then:\n\nm c\u00b2 =6 *938 =5,628 MeV =5.628 GeV.\n\nGamma is 25/7 \u22483.57142857.\n\nTotal energy E = 3.5714 *5.628 \u224820.1 GeV. Which is close to option C (20.132). So perhaps the question expects this approximation instead of using the exact atomic mass.\n\nSo maybe the problem assumes that the mass is mass number (A) times the nucleon mass (approx 938 MeV/c\u00b2) and ignores the electron mass. That would give 6*938=5628 MeV, so 5.628 GeV. Multiply by gamma (25/7):\n\n5.628 *3.5714 \u2248?\n\nCalculating:\n\n5 *3.5714 =17.857\n\n0.628 *3.5714 \u22482.243\n\nTotal is 17.857 +2.243 =20.1 GeV.

Let me compute that:\n\n5 *3.5714 =17.857,\n\n0.628 *3.5714 \u2248 0.6 *3.5714=2.1428 and 0.028*3.5714\u22480.100. So total 2.1428+0.100\u22482.2428.
