The key is apparent magnitude. The apparent magnitude (m) depends on the absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d). The formula is m - M = 5 log10(d / 10 pc). So m = M + 5 log10(d/10). \n\nFor each star with absolute V=15 and different distances:\n\na) Canopus: I need its apparent magnitude. Canopus is the second brightest star in the sky after Sirius. Its apparent V magnitude is about -0.72. Since it's so bright, it would definitely be detectable.\n\nb) Polaris: The North Star. Its apparent magnitude is around 2.0. Again, that's pretty bright. The VLT can handle that easily.\n\nNow the other options are stars with absolute magnitude 15 at various distances. Let's calculate their apparent magnitudes.\n\nFor a star with Mv=15:\n\nm = 15 + 5 log10(d/10)\n\nLet me compute for each of these:\n\nOption c) 10 pc:\n\nm = 15 +5*log10(10/10) \u2192 log10(1) is 0.

So m=15-1.505=13.495.\n\nOption f)50 pc: m=15 +5*log10(50/10)=15 +5*(log(5)) \u2192 log(5)= ~0.69897. 5*0.699\u22483.495 \u2192 m=15+3.5=18.5?",
          "text2": "Alternatively, perhaps the website provides a formula or a table for the S/N. Let me try to remember or think of standard S/N calculations. The S/N is proportional to sqrt(t * A * f), where t is exposure time, A is telescope area, and f is the flux of the star. The flux from the star depends on its apparent magnitude. \n\nSo, the apparent magnitude of each star can be calculated using their absolute magnitude and distance. Let's work through each option step by step.\n\nStarting with option a) Canopus. Canopus is a bright star. Let me recall its apparent magnitude. I think Canopus is the second brightest star in the night sky, so its V magnitude is about -0.72. Definitely much brighter than 15. So this star would be easily detectable. \n\nOption b) Polaris. Polaris, the North Star. Its apparent magnitude is around 2.0. Also way brighter than 15. So detectable. \n\nNow the other options (c to f) are stars with absolute V magnitude 15, but different distances. Let's calculate their apparent magnitudes.\n\nThe formula again: m = M + 5*log10(d/10). Since M is 15 for each of these.\n\nFor option c) distance is 10 pc.\n\nSo m = 15 + 5*log10(10/10) = 15 +5*log10(1) \u2192 log10(1) is 0. So m =15. So apparent magnitude 15. \n\nOption d) distance 200 pc: \n\nm =15 +5*log10(200/10) =15 +5*log10(20). log10(20) is approx 1.3010. So 5*1.301\u22486.505. So m\u224815+6.5=21.5 mag. \n\nOption e) 5 pc:\n\nm=15 +5*log10(5/10)=15 +5*log10(0.5). log10(0.5) is about -0.3010. So 5*(-0.301)= -1.505. So m=15-1.505\u224813.495 \u224813.5 mag.\n\nOption f) 50 pc:\n\nm=15 +5*log10(50/10)=15 +5*log10(5). log10(5)= ~0.69897. 5*0.69897\u22483.495. So m\u224815+3.5=18.5 mag.\n\nNow, which of these have apparent magnitudes such that with a 1-hour exposure on the VLT (8m) and ESPRESSO, the S/N per pixel is at least 10?\n\nWe need to know the limiting magnitude of ESPRESSO. Let me think again. From the ESPRESSO overview page, it says: \"ESPRESSO is designed to achieve radial velocity precision of 10 cm/s for V=9 stars in 1 hour... The instrument is capable of observing stars down to V=15 in a single hour exposure.\"",

The formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5*log10(d/10), where M is absolute magnitude and d is distance in parsecs. \n\nSo for options c, d, e, f, which have M=15 and different distances, I can calculate their apparent magnitudes. Let's do that for each:\n\nOption c: d=10 pc:\nm = 15 +5*log10(10/10) = 15 +5*0 =15. So apparent magnitude 15.\n\nOption e: d=5pc:\nm =15 +5*log10(5/10)=15 +5*log10(0.5)=15 +5*(-0.3010)=15-1.505\u224813.495. So about 13.5.\n\nOption f: d=50 pc:\nm=15 +5*log10(50/10)=15 +5*log10(5)=15+5*(0.69897)=15+3.49\u224818.49.

Canopus and Polaris.\n\nCanopus is the second brightest star in the night sky, after Sirius. Its apparent magnitude is about -0.72, so definitely way brighter than 15. Polaris, the North Star, has an apparent magnitude around 1.97. Both of these are much brighter than the limiting magnitude mentioned for ESPRESSO.\n\nFrom the ESPRESSO specs, if the limiting magnitude for 1-hour exposure and S/N of 10 is about V=15, then stars brighter than or equal to that should be okay.",

Since the ESPRESSO's website says it can reach stars down to V=15 for radial velocity measurements with a precision of 10 cm/s. To achieve that precision, they likely need a higher S/N. For example, if they need 10 cm/s precision, the required S/N might be around 100. \n\nThe formula for radial velocity precision is \u0394v \u2248 c/(S/N * R), where R is the spectral resolution. Suppose R is ~100,000 (which is typical for ESPRESSO). Then to get \u0394v=10 cm/s (0.01 km/s), then S/N needed would be roughly c/(\u0394v*R) = (3e5 km/s)/(0.01 km/s * 1e5) = 3e5/(1e3) = 300. So S/N per pixel would need to be about 300. So if for a V=15 star, they can get S/N=300 in some exposure time, then for S/N=10, the exposure time needed is (10/300)^2 times the original time.

The flux from the star depends on its apparent magnitude. \n\nSo, the apparent magnitude of each star can be calculated using their absolute magnitude and distance. Let's work through each option step by step.\n\nStarting with option a) Canopus. Canopus is a bright star. Let me recall its apparent magnitude. I think Canopus is the second brightest star in the night sky, so its V magnitude is about -0.72. Definitely much brighter than 15. So this star would be easily detectable. \n\nOption b) Polaris. Polaris, the North Star. Its apparent magnitude is around 2.0. Also way brighter than 15. So detectable. \n\nNow the other options (c to f) are stars with absolute V magnitude 15, but different distances. Let's calculate their apparent magnitudes.\n\nThe formula again: m = M + 5*log10(d/10). Since M is 15 for each of these.\n\nFor option c) distance is 10 pc.\n\nSo m = 15 + 5*log10(10/10) = 15 +5*log10(1) \u2192 log10(1) is 0. So m =15. So apparent magnitude 15. \n\nOption d) distance 200 pc: \n\nm =15 +5*log10(200/10) =15 +5*log10(20). log10(20) is approx 1.3010. So 5*1.301\u22486.505. So m\u224815+6.5=21.5 mag. \n\nOption e) 5 pc:\n\nm=15 +5*log10(5/10)=15 +5*log10(0.5). log10(0.5) is about -0.3010. So 5*(-0.301)= -1.505. So m=15-1.505\u224813.495 \u224813.5 mag.\n\nOption f) 50 pc:\n\nm=15 +5*log10(50/10)=15 +5*log10(5). log10(5)= ~0.69897. 5*0.69897\u22483.495.

For example, if they need 10 cm/s precision, the required S/N might be around 100. \n\nThe formula for radial velocity precision is \u0394v \u2248 c/(S/N * R), where R is the spectral resolution. Suppose R is ~100,000 (which is typical for ESPRESSO). Then to get \u0394v=10 cm/s (0.01 km/s), then S/N needed would be roughly c/(\u0394v*R) = (3e5 km/s)/(0.01 km/s * 1e5) = 3e5/(1e3) = 300. So S/N per pixel would need to be about 300. So if for a V=15 star, they can get S/N=300 in some exposure time, then for S/N=10, the exposure time needed is (10/300)^2 times the original time.

Its apparent magnitude is about -0.72. So that's very bright. Definitely, even a short exposure would give a high S/N. So Canopus is detectable.

Its apparent magnitude is about -0.72. So that's very bright. Definitely, even a short exposure would give a high S/N. So Canopus is detectable. So that's one.\n\nPolaris (the North Star) has an apparent magnitude around 1.97. Also very bright. So again, even a short exposure would give a high S/N. So Polaris is also detectable.
