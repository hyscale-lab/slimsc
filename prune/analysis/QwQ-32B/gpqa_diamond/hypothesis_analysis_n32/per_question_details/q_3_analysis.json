So that cross term is zero.\n\nThird term: (sqrt(3)/2) \u27e8\u2193| multiplied by 0.5*(1)|\u2191\u27e9 \u2192 (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9 \u2192 again zero because they're orthogonal.\n\nFourth term: (sqrt(3)/2) \u27e8\u2193| multiplied by (sqrt(3)/2)(-1)|\u2193\u27e9 \u2192 (sqrt(3)/2)*( -sqrt(3)/2 ) * \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9 \u2192 (- (3/4)) *1 = -3/4.\n\nSo adding the first and fourth terms: 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.",

Maybe easier to write \u03c3_x in matrix form and compute the expectation.\n\nThe Pauli matrix \u03c3_x is:\n\n[0 1]\n[1 0]\n\nIn the z-basis, where |\u2191\u27e9 is (1,0) and |\u2193\u27e9 is (0,1). So the state vector is a column vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.\n\nThe expectation value \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 is the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by \u03c3_x multiplied by the state vector.\n\nLet me compute that. Let me denote the state vector as a column vector:\n\n|\u03c8\u27e9 = [0.5, (sqrt(3)/2)]^T.\n\nThe conjugate transpose \u27e8\u03c8| is a row vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].\n\nSo, multiplying \u27e8\u03c8| with \u03c3_x gives:\n\n[0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [0 1; 1 0] \n\n= [0.5*0 + sqrt(3)/2 *1 , 0.5*1 + sqrt(3)/2 *0 ]\n\n= [ sqrt(3)/2 , 0.5 ]\n\nThen multiplying this with |\u03c8\u27e9 gives:\n\n[ sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 + 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) ]",

The fourth term is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1). Because (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4). So 3/4 * (-1) is -3/4. So total is 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Yes, that's correct.\n\nOkay, so \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 is -0.5.

So the bra vector is \u27e8\u03c8| = a* \u27e8\u2191| + b* \u27e8\u2193|. Since the coefficients are real here, it's just a \u27e8\u2191| + b \u27e8\u2193|.\n\nThen \u03c3_z acting on |\u03c8\u27e9 is \u03c3_z (a|\u2191\u27e9 + b|\u2193\u27e9) = a \u03c3_z |\u2191\u27e9 + b \u03c3_z |\u2193\u27e9 = a*(+1)|\u2191\u27e9 + b*(-1)|\u2193\u27e9. So the expectation value is \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_z |\u03c8\u27e9 = [a \u27e8\u2191| + b \u27e8\u2193| ] * [a |\u2191\u27e9 - b |\u2193\u27e9]\n\nMultiplying these out:\n\na^2 \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 + a b \u27e8\u2191|\u2193\u27e9 - a b \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9 - b^2 \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9\n\nBut \u27e8\u2191|\u2193\u27e9 and \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9 are zero, since they're orthogonal. And \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 and \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9 are 1. So this simplifies to a^2 (1) - b^2 (1). \n\nTherefore \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2.\n\nPlugging in the values: a is 0.5, so a\u00b2 is 0.25. b is sqrt(3)/2, so b\u00b2 is (3/4) which is 0.75. So 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.",

Let's compute term by term:\n\nFirst term: 0.5 \u27e8\u2191| multiplied by 0.5*(+1)|\u2191\u27e9 gives 0.5*0.5*(1)\u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 \u2192 0.25*(1) since the inner product of same states is 1.\n\nSecond term: 0.5 \u27e8\u2191| multiplied by (sqrt(3)/2)(-1)|\u2193\u27e9 \u2192 0.5 * (-sqrt(3)/2) \u27e8\u2191|\u2193\u27e9 \u2192 but \u27e8\u2191|\u2193\u27e9 is zero. So that cross term is zero.\n\nThird term: (sqrt(3)/2) \u27e8\u2193| multiplied by 0.5*(1)|\u2191\u27e9 \u2192 (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9 \u2192 again zero because they're orthogonal.\n\nFourth term: (sqrt(3)/2) \u27e8\u2193| multiplied by (sqrt(3)/2)(-1)|\u2193\u27e9 \u2192 (sqrt(3)/2)*( -sqrt(3)/2 ) * \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9 \u2192 (- (3/4)) *1 = -3/4.\n\nSo adding the first and fourth terms: 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.",

Let me recall that in the basis of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9, the Pauli matrix \u03c3x is represented as:\n\n\u03c3x = [ [0, 1], [1, 0] ]\n\nSo to compute \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9, let's first write out the state vectors. Let me denote |\u03c8\u27e9 as a column vector. The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. So:\n\n|\u03c8\u27e9 = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]\n\nThen the conjugate transpose (since we're dealing with complex numbers, but here all coefficients are real) \u27e8\u03c8| is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].\n\nSo the inner product \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9 would be:\n\n[0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * \u03c3x * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]\n\nLet me compute that step by step. First, multiplying \u03c3x with the column vector |\u03c8\u27e9:\n\n\u03c3x * |\u03c8\u27e9 = [0,1;1,0] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [sqrt(3)/2 ; 0.5]\n\nThen, the bra vector \u27e8\u03c8| is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], so when we take the dot product with the result above:\n\n0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5",

So expanding the terms:\n\nFirst, apply \u03c3_z to each term in the |\u03c8\u27e9:\n\n\u03c3_z |\u03c8\u27e9 = 0.5 * \u03c3_z |\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)* \u03c3_z |\u2193\u27e9 = 0.5*(1)|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)*(-1)|\u2193\u27e9.\n\nSo now the whole expression is:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_z|\u03c8\u27e9 = 0.5\u27e8\u2191| [0.5*1|\u2191\u27e9 - (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9 ] + (sqrt(3)/2)\u27e8\u2193| [0.5*1|\u2191\u27e9 - (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9 ]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: 0.5 * \u27e8\u2191| multiplied by the first part:\n\n0.5 * 0.5 * \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 *1 + 0.5 * (-sqrt(3)/2)* \u27e8\u2191|\u2193\u27e9 \n\nSimilarly for the second term:\n\n(sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 * \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9 *1 + (sqrt(3)/2)*(-sqrt(3)/2)* \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9 \n\nBut \u27e8\u2191|\u2193\u27e9 =0 and \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9=0, so cross terms vanish. Then we have:\n\nFirst term's contribution: (0.5)^2 *1 (since \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9=1) \n\nSecond term's contribution: (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1) (since \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9=1 and the coefficient is -sqrt(3)/2 multiplied by sqrt(3)/2 in front?)",
