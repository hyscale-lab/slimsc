Then, passing through tube 1 (which absorbs H2O), so the H2O is removed, leaving O2 and N2O. Then passing through tube 2, which doesn't react (since no CO2), so those gases remain. Then tube 3 has red hot Cu, which reacts with O2. The O2 would be consumed in forming CuO (mass gain of 0.8g, which is 0.025 mol O2). The remaining gas would then be N2O. \n\nSo, if the initial gases were O2 and N2O and H2O, then after tube 1, H2O is gone. Then, O2 and N2O go to tube 3. The O2 reacts with Cu to form CuO, so the remaining gas is N2O.

So 32x =0.80 \u2192 x =0.025 mol.\n\nSimilarly, if y moles of NO2 react (each provides 1 O per mole of CuO formed?), then the mass gain from NO2 would be 16y grams.

So total O2 is n(a2 + b2). \n\nThe reaction in tube3 consumes some O2, leading to mass gain. The mass gain is 0.80g = moles of O in O2 consumed *16 (since each O atom contributes 16g/mol). \n\nThe moles of O2 reacted is (0.80g)/32g/mol =0.025 mol. So total O2 consumed is 0.025 mol. \n\nAssuming all O2 from the salts goes into tube3 and reacts, then the total O2 from salts must be >=0.025. \n\nThe remaining gas after tube3 would be the other gases plus any unreacted O2. \n\nThe problem states that only 0.1 mol of gas C remains. So, suppose that all gases except one are consumed. \n\nLet me think that the only gas remaining is N2O, and the other gases (O2 and whatever else) are either absorbed or reacted. \n\nSo total N2O from salt A must be 0.1 mol. Let\u2019s say salt A produces x N2O per mole, then n*x =0.1 \u2192 x =0.1/n. \n\nSuppose salt A is NH4NO3, which produces 1 N2O per mole. So x=1 \u2192 n*1=0.1 \u2192 n=0.1. \n\nThus total moles of each salt is 0.1. \n\nSalt A: NH4NO3 gives 0.1 mol N2O and 0.2 mol H2O (since 0.1*2=0.2). \n\nSalt B must contribute the O2. Suppose salt B produces O2 and some other gas that is absorbed or reacts. \n\nThe O2 from salt B must be 0.025 mol (since that's what reacts in tube3). \n\nSo salt B produces 0.025 /0.1 =0.25 moles O2 per mole of salt B. \n\nWhat salt gives 0.25 moles O2 per mole? Let's see:\n\nThe decomposition reaction for salt B must produce O2. Let's suppose it's KClO3 (potassium chlorate):\n\nThe decomposition is 2 KClO3 \u2192 2 KCl + 3 O2. \n\nPer 2 moles KClO3 \u21923 O2. So per mole, 1.5 O2.

Let me think of the possible gases:\n\nThe first tube (Mg(ClO4)2) probably absorbs a gas like H2O (since it's a drying agent?), so the 3.60g is H2O, which is 0.2 moles. \n\nThe third tube's gain is 0.80g from CuO formation. So, as I thought earlier, if that's oxygen, then 0.025 moles (since 0.8g O2 is 0.8/32 = 0.025).",

Since O is part of CuO, each mole of CuO has 1 mole of O. So moles of O added is 0.80g / 16g/mol = 0.05 mol. Since O2 is consumed, each mole of O2 provides 2 moles of O. So moles of O2 needed would be 0.05 /2 = 0.025 mol.",

Because according to the earlier calculation, the O2 needed to form the 0.8g increase in tube3 is 0.025 mol. But here, if salt A gives 0.15 mol O2, then that O2 would all go into tube3.

Let me think of another pair.\n\nSuppose Salt A is ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3), which on heating decomposes into NH3, CO2, and H2O:\n\nNH4HCO3 \u2192 NH3 + CO2 + H2O.\n\nSalt B is something else that produces O2.\n\nBut then the CO2 would be absorbed in tube2 (Ca(OH)2), causing the tube's mass to increase. But the problem states the tube2's mass didn't change, so CO2 can't be present. Thus, Salt A can't be ammonium bicarbonate.\n\nHmm, tricky. Let me try to think of the possible gases that can be in the system:\n\nThe gases must be such that:\n\n- H2O is absorbed in tube1 (so present).\n\n- The gas that reacts in tube3 (Cu) to form CuO must be an oxidizer, like O2.\n\n- The remaining gas (gas C) must not react with any of the tubes and must be 0.1 mol.\n\nPossible gas C could be N2, which doesn't react. Or maybe CO, but then in tube3, if there's CuO, CO could reduce it, but then tube3's mass would decrease? Not sure.",

The mass gain would correspond to 0.15 mol O2? But the mass increased by 0.80g, which is 0.80/32=0.025 mol O2. That's a problem. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach. Let's think of the total gases. The total gas after decomposition is H2O (0.2 mol), O2 (x mol), and remaining gas C (0.1 mol). The O2 that reacted in tube3 is (0.80g /32g/mol)=0.025 mol. So the O2 in the gas must have been 0.025 mol (all of it reacted). So total O2 is 0.025 mol. \n\nSo total gases are H2O (0.2), O2 (0.025), and the remaining gas (0.1). So total gas volume before passing through the tubes: 0.2+0.025+0.1=0.325 mol. \n\nNow, the salts A and B, each n moles, must produce these gases. \n\nLet me think of possible salts.

Let's say it's lead(II) nitrate, which decomposes as:\n\n2 Pb(NO3)2 \u2192 2 PbO + 4 NO2 + O2.\n\nSo per 2 moles of B, produces 1 mole O2 (so 0.5 per mole of B).\n\nAdditionally, it produces 4 NO2, so 2 per mole of B. \n\nNow, let\u2019s let moles of each salt be n. \n\nTotal H2O from A: 2n.\n\nTotal O2 from B: 0.5n.\n\nTotal N2O from A: n.\n\nTotal NO2 from B: 2n.\n\nTotal gases:\n\nH2O: 2n \u2192 this must equal 0.2 mol \u2192 2n =0.2 \u2192 n=0.1.\n\nSo O2: 0.5 *0.1 =0.05 mol. But we need O2 to be 0.025 mol (since only that reacted in tube3). So this is double what's needed. \n\nHmm, maybe B is a different salt. Let's see. If B is KClO3:\n\n2 KClO3 \u2192 2 KCl + 3 O2 \u2192 per 2 moles gives 3 O2 \u2192 per mole gives 1.5 O2. \n\nSuppose salt B is KClO3. Then, for n moles of B, O2 produced is 1.5n. \n\nThen total O2 would be 1.5n, which needs to be 0.025 mol. \n\nH2O from A (assuming A is NH4NO3) is 2n =0.2 \u2192 n=0.1. Then O2 from B would be 1.5 *0.1 =0.15 mol. That's too much. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need another approach. Let's consider the remaining gas, gas C, which is 0.1 mol. What could that be? The gas that remains after all reactions. \n\nThe gases that weren't absorbed or reacted would be whatever didn't interact with the tubes. \n\nThe first tube absorbs H2O. The second tube doesn't react (so no CO2 and maybe other gases like N2O or NO2 don't react with Ca(OH)2. The third tube reacts O2 with Cu to form CuO (so O2 is consumed). Any other gases would pass through. \n\nSo the remaining gas (gas C) must be any gases that didn't react. \n\nSo, in the previous example with A=NH4NO3 and B=Pb(NO3)2, the gases are:\n\nH2O (absorbed), O2 (reacted in tube3), N2O (passes through), and NO2 (passes through). Then the remaining gas would be N2O + NO2. \n\nTotal remaining gas would be (n + 2n) = 3n. With n=0.1, that's 0.3 mol. But the problem states that remaining gas is 0.1 mol, so this doesn't fit. \n\nHmm, maybe the remaining gas is only one type. Let me think of another possibility.",

But since we don't know the solid's mass, maybe all the salts decomposed into gases (impossible for nitrates which leave oxides), but the problem states only gases were formed. So maybe the salts are such that all products are gases.\n\nFor example, ammonium nitrate decomposes into N2, O2, and H2O (gases).

Suppose that the decomposition of Salt B produces x moles of O2 and y moles of another gas, say N2. \n\nSo, total O2 is 0.025 mol, so x =0.025. \n\nThen, the remaining gas (after tube3) would be N2 and any other gases not O2. \n\nBut let's try to model this.\n\nLet me suppose that Salt B decomposes as: \n\nSalt B \u2192 O2 + N2 \n\nSo per mole of B, gives a certain amount of O2 and N2. \n\nLet me suppose that the decomposition equation is 2 B \u2192 O2 + ...",

Because Ca(OH)2 reacts with CO2 to form CaCO3, which would increase mass. Since no change, so no CO2. So the gas that would have caused CO2 must not be present, or maybe it was already removed. So the gas mixture doesn't have CO2. Then tube 3's mass increased by 0.80 g, forming CuO. So maybe a gas like hydrogen, which reacts with CuO? Let me think.

Since it didn't, there's no CO2. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to track all the gases step by step. \n\nFirst, the initial mixture of salts A and B (equimolar) when heated produced some gases. Let's suppose that the salts decompose into various gases, and then we track those gases through the tubes. \n\nThe total mass of the salt mixture is 7.20g, equimolar. Let me denote the moles of each salt as n. So moles of A = n, moles of B = n. \n\nThe gases produced would go through tube1 (Mg(ClO4)2). The mass gained here is 3.60g. Let me think that this is the mass of water absorbed. Because Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent (like a desiccant), so it absorbs water. So the 3.60g is the mass of H2O. \n\nThen, the gas mixture (after removing water) goes through tube2, which is Ca(OH)2 solution. Since the mass didn't change, that suggests that there's no CO2 present (since CO2 would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 precipitate, increasing mass). So the gas after tube2 must not have CO2. \n\nThen, the gas goes through tube3 (red-hot Cu) and the mass increases by 0.80g. The product is CuO. The mass gain here is due to the oxygen or another component reacting with the Cu. \n\nThe final remaining gas is 2.24 L at STP, which is 2.24 / 22.4 = 0.1 moles. Let's note that this is gas C, which is the remaining after all steps. \n\nLet me try to work backwards. The final gas is 0.1 moles. Let me note that the gas C is what remains after passing through all tubes. Since tube2 didn't change mass, the gas must not have CO2. The gas could be N2, O2, H2, or maybe CO? Let's see. \n\nAlso, the total gases from the initial heating must account for the mass of the salts. The salts A and B are equimolar, so let's denote their molar masses as M_A and M_B respectively. Since the total mass is 7.20g, the moles are n = (7.20)/(M_A + M_B). \n\nHmm, but maybe it's better to think in terms of the gases. Let me try to list possible reactions for the salts. \n\nThe problem mentions that when the salts are heated, they form gases. The salts are likely carbonates and nitrates?

The remaining gas after tube 3 would be whatever gases didn't react. \n\nSo the total gas after all steps is gas C = 0.1 moles. \n\nSo let me tabulate all the gases:\n\nTotal gases from salts: \n\n- H2O: 0.2 moles (absorbed in tube 1)\n- O2: let's denote as y moles (part of which reacted in tube 3)\n- Other gases: let's say Z moles (which are not absorbed and don't react)\n- Additionally, maybe other gases like N2, etc.?\n\nThe gas after tube 1: O2 (y) + Z. \n\nThen, in tube 3, the O2 is consumed. The amount of O2 consumed is 0.025 moles (from earlier calculation). So the remaining O2 would be (y - 0.025) moles. \n\nThe total remaining gas after tube 3 is (y - 0.025) + Z = 0.1 moles. \n\nAdditionally, any other gases that didn't react would contribute. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should approach it by considering the total gas moles.",

Let's try to think of possible reactions in tube 3.\n\nThe mass gain in tube 3 is 0.80 g, which is the formation of CuO. But how? For example, if the gas contains O2, then Cu metal can oxidize to CuO. But the reaction would be:\n\n2Cu + O2 \u2192 2CuO.\n\nIf the gas has O2, then passing through red-hot Cu would form CuO, increasing the mass. The amount of O2 would then contribute to the mass gain.

Let's say salt B is NaClO3, decomposing to NaCl and O2. \n\nThe other salt (A) could be something that produces H2O and maybe another gas like CO. For example, suppose salt A is ammonium carbonate ( (NH4)2CO3 ), which decomposes into NH3, CO2, and H2O.",

Its decomposition is 2 KClO3 \u2192 2 KCl + 3 O2. \n\nSo, if both salts are present in equimolar amounts, then let me denote their moles as n each. \n\nSo, for A (ammonium nitrate): each mole gives 1 mole N2O and 2 moles H2O.\n\nFor B (KClO3): each mole gives 1.5 moles O2 (since 2 moles produce 3 moles O2, so per mole it's 1.5 O2).\n\nTotal H2O produced would be 2n (from A) + 0 (from B?) \u2192 2n.\n\nThe O2 from B would be 1.5n.\n\nThe N2O from A would be n.\n\nThen, the gases would be:\n\nH2O (2n mol), O2 (1.5n mol), N2O (n mol).\n\nThese gases are passed through tube1 (Mg(ClO4)2). The H2O is absorbed, adding 2n mol H2O, which would have a mass of 2n * 18 = 36n g. The problem states that the mass gain here is 3.60g. So, 36n = 3.60 \u2192 n=0.1. \n\nSo n is 0.1 mol for each salt. \n\nThen, the O2 from B is 1.5 *0.1 =0.15 mol. \n\nThe N2O is 0.1 mol. \n\nThe H2O is 0.2 mol (2n=0.2). \n\nThen, after tube1, the remaining gases are O2 (0.15 mol) and N2O (0.1 mol). \n\nThen they go through tube2 (Ca(OH)2 solution). The problem states that the second tube's mass didn't change, so no reaction. N2O wouldn't react with Ca(OH)2, so that's okay. \n\nThen, the gases go to tube3 (red-hot Cu).

Let me check the numbers again. \n\nIf n=0.1, then O2 from B is 0.15 mol, which would produce a mass gain of 0.15*32=4.8g, but the problem says it's 0.8g.

But O2 would oxidize the copper, but if the copper is already in a red-hot state perhaps it's in a reducing environment? I'm a bit confused here, but let's note that the mass of tube 3 increased by 0.80g due to CuO formation.\n\nFinally, after passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at STP. Since 22.4 liters is a mole, 2.24 L is 0.1 moles. That might be important for figuring out the amount of gas left.\n\nLet me start by considering the steps:\n\nFirst, the gases produced from heating salts A and B. Since they are equimolar, let's let n be the moles of each. So total moles of salts is 2n. The total mass is 7.20g, so (mass of A per mole + mass of B per mole) * n = 7.20g. But maybe I can get more info from the other data.\n\nLooking at the tubes:\n\nTube 1 (Mg(ClO4)\u2082): mass increased by 3.60g. Since Mg(ClO4)\u2082 is anhydrous, perhaps it's acting as a drying agent, so absorbing water vapor? Then the mass gain is from the water. So the amount of water is 3.60g. So moles of H2O would be 3.60 / 18 = 0.2 moles?",

So gas C is 0.1 mol. Since the gas is left, it must have passed through all three tubes without reacting. Let me think of possible gases that could survive all three tubes. The first tube absorbs water, so gas C isn't water. The second tube doesn't absorb anything, so it's not CO2. The third tube had red-hot copper forming CuO, so perhaps gas C didn't react there. So perhaps gas C is nitrogen or something inert. But maybe it's N2? Or maybe it's another gas like O2, but not sure.\n\nLet me think about the possible products from heating salts A and B. Since they are salts, when heated, they might decompose. Common decomposition reactions for salts could produce various gases like NH3, CO2, SO2, H2O, etc. But in this case, since tube 2 didn't gain mass, so no CO2. The presence of water is accounted for in tube 1 (3.60g). The tube 3's mass increased by 0.80g, which is from the formation of CuO. The copper's mass gain would be from the oxygen in CuO.
