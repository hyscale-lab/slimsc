Let me consider possible reactions step by step.\n\nFirst, the reaction between 1-bromo-2-deuteriobenzene and NaNH2 in ammonia. \n\nPossible reactions:\n\n1. Nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr): The NH2^- (from NaNH2) attacks the benzene ring, replacing Br. The leaving group is Br^-.\n\nIn this case, the directing group would be the bromine (since D is just a deuterium, not an electron-withdrawing group). Bromine is meta-directing. So the incoming nucleophile (NH2^-) would attack at positions meta to Br, which are 4 and 6. So two possible products here: 2-D, 4-NH2, 1-Br; and 2-D, 6-NH2, 1-Br.",

The reaction is with NaNH2 in ammonia solvent. \n\nBenzyne formation typically requires a strong base (like butyllithium) and a leaving group (halide). The base abstracts an adjacent proton, leading to elimination of the halide. \n\nIn this case, the base is NaNH2. The solvent is ammonia. \n\nThe Br is at position 1. The adjacent H's are at 2 (D) and 6. Since 2 has D, the only available H is at 6. So the base can abstract that H, leading to the formation of benzyne (elimination of H and Br, forming a double bond between 1 and 6, but actually a triple bond for benzyne). \n\nOnce the benzyne is formed, it can react with the amine (NH2^-) to form a new ring. The benzyne is a good electrophile, so the amine would attack either of the two carbons involved in the triple bond (positions 1 or 6). \n\nIf attacking at position 1, then that carbon would get the amine group.

Therefore, each gives a different benzyne structure.\n\nNow, when ammonia attacks these benzyne intermediates, the NH2 group can add to either end of the triple bond.

Let me think: when benzyne is formed, the substituted groups are in certain positions. The original substituents (Br and D) are at positions 1 and 2. After forming benzyne, the triple bond is between 1 and 6 (assuming the deprotonation was at 6). The D is at position 2, so when the benzyne reacts with ammonia, the NH2 group could attach to the carbon that was originally position 6, leading to the amino group at position 6.

This creates a carbanion adjacent to the Br. Then, the leaving group (Br^-) departs, and the electrons from the C-Br bond form a triple bond with the deprotonated carbon. Thus, the triple bond is between the original leaving group's carbon (position1) and the deprotonated carbon (either position 2, 4, or 6). However, in this case, position2 already has D, so only 6 and 4 are available.\n\nSo when the proton is abstracted at the ortho (position6), the triple bond is between 1 and6. When abstracted at para (position4), triple bond is between 1 and4. Therefore, each gives a different benzyne structure.\n\nNow, when ammonia attacks these benzyne intermediates, the NH2 group can add to either end of the triple bond. For the first case (triplet between 1 and6):\n\n- Adding NH2 to 1 \u2192 amino at1\n\n- Adding to 6 \u2192 amino at6\n\nFor the second case (triple between 1 and4):\n\n- Adding to 1 \u2192 amino at1\n\n- Adding to4 \u2192 amino at4\n\nThus, the possible products are amino at1,6, or4.
