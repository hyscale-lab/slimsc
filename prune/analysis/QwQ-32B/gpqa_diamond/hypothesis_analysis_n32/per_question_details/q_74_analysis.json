          "text1": "Wait, the memoryless property says that the probability of decaying in the next t minutes is the same as if it had just started, given that it hasn't decayed yet. So maybe I need to adjust the time accordingly?\n\nLet me clarify. The given probability is 32% for 100 minutes. Let me denote the decay constant as \u03bb. The probability of decay within time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). They tell us that P(100) = 0.32. So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100\u03bb). Solving for \u03bb: e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68, so -100\u03bb = ln(0.68), so \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100. Let me calculate that. ln(0.68) is approximately...

But the given 32% is over 100 minutes. So maybe I need to find the decay constant first?\n\nLet me recall the formula. The probability of decay after time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant. Here, they say that P(100) = 0.32. So I can set up the equation 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100). Solving for \u03bb:\n\ne^(-\u03bb*100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\nTake natural logarithm of both sides: -\u03bb*100 = ln(0.68)\nSo \u03bb = - ln(0.68) / 100. Let me compute that.

Then the square root of that is sqrt(0.3144). Let me compute sqrt(0.3144). \n\nWell sqrt(0.36)=0.6, sqrt(0.25)=0.5, sqrt(0.3144) is between 0.56 and 0.56. Let me see, 0.56^2 = 0.3136. Oh, that's very close. 0.56 squared is 0.3136, so sqrt(0.3144)\u22480.5603.\n\nTherefore, 0.68^1.5 \u22480.5603. Thus, the probability is 1 -0.5603\u22480.4397, so approximately 44%, which matches the previous calculation.\n\nTherefore the answer should be option A) 44%.",
