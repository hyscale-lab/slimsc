Let me recalculate step by step. \n\nFirst, \u0394E is 8.57 eV. \n\nk is Boltzmann constant: 8.617e-5 eV per Kelvin.\n\nSo \u0394E/(k) = 8.57 / 8.617e-5. Let's recalculate this:\n\n8.57 divided by 8.617e-5. \n\nLet me compute 8.57 / 8.617e-5. \n\nLet me write it as 8.57 / (8.617 *10^-5) = (8.57 /8.617) *10^5 \u2248 (approx 0.994) *1e5 = ~99,400. That part is correct. \n\nThe term (1/T2 -1/T1) is 1/5500 -1/6000. \n\nLet me compute 1/5500 = approx 0.0001818 (since 1/5500 = 2/(11000) \u22480.0001818)\n\n1/6000 = 0.000166666...\n\nSubtracting: 0.0001818 -0.0001666 =0.0000152 (approx 1.52e-5). \n\nSo the total exponent is 99,400 * 1.52e-5 \u2248 ?\n\n99,400 *1.52e-5 = (99,400 *1.52) * 1e-5 \n\nCalculate 99,400 *1.52:\n\n99,400 *1.5 = 149,100\n\n99,400 *0.02 =1,988 \u2192 total 149,100 +1,988 =151,088. \n\nSo 151,088 *1e-5 =15.1088. \n\nSo exponent is ~15.1. \n\nHmm, exp(15.1) is indeed a huge number (like exp(10) is ~22026, exp(15) is ~3.269 million). But the options given don't have such a big number. The options are 1.1, 7.8, 4.5, 2.9. So I must have messed up the calculation.",
