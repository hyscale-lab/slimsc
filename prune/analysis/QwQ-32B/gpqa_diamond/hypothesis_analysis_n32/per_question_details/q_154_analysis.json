So that fits. \n\nOption D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Same formula as B? Because the positions don't change the formula. It would also be C7H5ClO2 (since the Cl is in position 2 instead of 4). So same molecular weight. \n\nSo both B and D have a molecular weight of ~156.5, so their M+ would be at 156 or 157. The given is 156, which matches. \n\nOption B and D are possible. \n\nNow, looking at the IR. 4-chlorobenzoic acid (B) or 2-chlorobenzoic acid (D) would have a carboxylic acid (so O-H and C=O), which aligns with the IR peaks (broad O-H and C=O at 1720). The C=O in a carboxylic acid is around 1700-1710 cm^-1. The given is 1720, which is a bit high. Maybe that's okay because different substituents can shift the peak. \n\nNow the NMR. Let's look at the NMR data for the options. \n\nFor 4-chlorobenzoic acid (B): the structure is benzene with COOH at position 1 and Cl at 4. The aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. The protons at 2 and 6 are meta to Cl and ortho to COOH.",

The IR of chloroformate would have a carbonyl around 1720 (maybe, but chloroformate's carbonyl might be a bit different?), but the O-H peak would not be present because chloroformate is OCl-O-CO-O-Ph, so there's no O-H. The given IR has a broad O-H peak, so option C is out because it wouldn't have an O-H. Therefore, C can be eliminated.\n\nOption D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. That would have Cl and COOH on adjacent carbons (meta?), but let's see. The molecular formula would be the same as B and C: C7H5ClO2, so molecular ion m/z 156. The NMR would have the carboxylic acid proton at ~11 ppm. The aromatic protons would be different because the Cl is ortho to the COOH. The chemical shifts for the aromatic protons would be different. For 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the Cl is on the adjacent carbon to the carboxylic acid. The aromatic protons would be split into different peaks. Let's think: in 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the meta and para positions relative to Cl. The two aromatic protons adjacent to Cl would have different shifts. But the NMR given has two doublets: 8.02 (2H) and 7.72 (2H). Let's see if that fits. For 4-chlorobenzoic acid (option B), the Cl and COOH are para, so the aromatic protons would be in two groups. For 2-chlorobenzoic acid (D), the Cl is meta to the COOH. The chemical shifts might be more upfield or downfield. Let me think: the positions of the protons. In 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the two aromatic protons between Cl and COOH (the para ones) might resonate at higher frequency (higher ppm).

For 2-chlorobenzoic acid (D), the Cl is meta to the COOH. The chemical shifts might be more upfield or downfield. Let me think: the positions of the protons. In 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the two aromatic protons between Cl and COOH (the para ones) might resonate at higher frequency (higher ppm). The peaks given at 8.02 and 7.72 could be consistent with either. Hmm.\n\nNow, looking at the 1H NMR data again. The two doublets: 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). The J (coupling constant) isn't given, but the fact that they are doublets suggests they are coupling with one adjacent proton. Let me think of the actual structure. For 4-chlorobenzoic acid: the aromatic ring has Cl and COOH on opposite carbons. The two protons adjacent to Cl (meta to COOH) would be in one set, and the other two (para to Cl, meta to COOH?)",

So, the total H would be 6 (from benzaldehyde's 6 H in the ring plus the H in the aldehyde's CH) minus 1 (for Cl) plus 1 (for OH) \u2192 6 H. So the formula is indeed C7H6O2Cl. Mass is 12*7=84 + 6=90 + 35.5=125.5 + 32 (O2)=157.5. \n\nHmm, discrepancy. The given mass is 156. So this might rule out option A. \n\nBack to options B and D. They have the correct molecular weight (156.5). Their NMR data must be considered. \n\nIn 4-chlorobenzoic acid (option B), the aromatic protons would be as follows. The carboxylic acid is at position 1, Cl at 4. The protons at positions 2 and 6 would be meta to both substituents, while positions 3 and 5 are ortho to Cl. The protons at 3 and 5 would be more deshielded (higher ppm), while 2 and 6 are less so. \n\nThe NMR shows two doublets: one at 8.02 (higher ppm) and one at 7.72. The 8.02 could be the ortho protons (positions 3 and 5), which are adjacent to Cl (electron-withdrawing), so higher ppm. The 7.72 could be the meta protons (positions 2 and 6). The doublet nature suggests coupling between adjacent protons. \n\nIn the case of benzoic acid derivatives, the protons adjacent to the carboxylic acid are also deshielded. Since the carboxylic acid is at position 1, the H at position 2 is adjacent to it, which would be highly deshielded. But in this case, maybe the Cl's effect is stronger?",

Adding an OH (adding an O and H) would make it C7H6ClO2. So that's correct. So molecular weight 157.5. Not matching the given mass of 156. So A is out.\n\nHmm. Now back to options B, C, D. Since C is out due to the lack of O-H, we're left with B and D. Both have the same molecular formula. Let's look at the NMR data again.\n\nThe NMR peaks for aromatic protons are at 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). The doublets suggest coupling between adjacent H's. In a symmetric molecule like 4-chlorobenzoic acid (B), the H's at positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 equivalent. So two sets of doublets. The chemical shifts would be higher near the Cl and COOH groups. The difference between 8.02 and 7.72 is about 0.3 ppm. Maybe that's due to the substituents' positions.",

The peaks given at 8.02 and 7.72 could be consistent with either. Hmm.\n\nNow, looking at the 1H NMR data again. The two doublets: 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). The J (coupling constant) isn't given, but the fact that they are doublets suggests they are coupling with one adjacent proton. Let me think of the actual structure. For 4-chlorobenzoic acid: the aromatic ring has Cl and COOH on opposite carbons. The two protons adjacent to Cl (meta to COOH) would be in one set, and the other two (para to Cl, meta to COOH?)",

The other peak at 158 would be the Cl-37 isotope. Since Cl-37 is about 25% abundance, the 158 peak should be about 25% of the main peak.

The H at 6 is adjacent to position 5 and COOH. \n\nThe proton at position 2 and 6 might be in similar environments, but the presence of Cl at 4 might affect their chemical shifts. The Cl is at 4, so positions 3 and 5 are next to Cl. The H's at 2 and 6 would be further away. The chemical shifts would be as follows: \n\nThe protons near the Cl (positions 3 and 5) would have higher chemical shifts (more deshielded) due to the electron-withdrawing Cl. The H at position 2 and 6 would be less shielded, but maybe in different positions. The NMR data shows two doublets at 8.02 and 7.72. Let's see, if there are two sets of H's, perhaps the H's next to Cl (positions 3 and 5) are in one group and the others in another. But the exact shifts are hard to predict without more info. \n\nOption B's NMR: The 1H NMR would have the carboxylic acid O-H as a broad signal around 12 ppm (the given is 11.0), which is close. The aromatic signals would be in the 7-8 ppm range. Let's see the given data: 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). The two doublets with 2H each.

That would also have formula C7H5ClO2, same as B. The difference is the position of Cl and COOH. So the molecular weight is same. \n\nLooking at the NMR data. The NMR shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm. For benzoic acid (options B and D), the carboxylic acid proton is usually a broad singlet around 10-12 ppm, so that matches. The other peaks: at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm.

Each of those carbons would have H's except where substituted. \n\nThe COOH is at position 1, so:\n\nPosition1: COOH (no H).\n\nPosition4: Cl (no H).\n\nPositions 2,3,5,6 have H's. So four H's on the ring. The NMR shows four H's (from the two doublets each with 2H). That matches. \n\nThe NMR peaks are at 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). Let's think about the chemical shifts. The Cl at position 4 and the COOH at 1. The protons at positions 2 and 6 are meta to Cl, and positions 3 and 5 are ortho. \n\nThe meta protons (positions 2 and 6) would be in a similar environment, and the ortho (positions 3 and 5) would be another. \n\nIn benzoic acid, the aromatic protons are typically around 7-8 ppm. Adding a Cl at position 4 would shift those protons. The meta protons (2 and 6) would be less deshielded than the ortho ones.",
