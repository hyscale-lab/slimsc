The aldehyde's carbonyl carbon is bonded to oxygen (as in R-CHO). The Grignard reagent (CH3-MgBr) would add: the MgBr is the leaving group. The R-C(O)- would become R-C(-O-) with the Grignard's R (CH3) attached. The reaction would form a new carbon-carbon bond between the carbonyl carbon and the methyl group. So the product would be a tertiary alcohol? Because the carbonyl carbon now has three groups: the original two (the H from the aldehyde and the CH2-CH=CH- part?), wait maybe I need to structure this properly.",

The product would be CH2(OH)CH3, which is ethanol. So that adds a methyl group to the carbonyl carbon, so the original 1 carbon (in formaldehyde) becomes part of a two-carbon chain.
