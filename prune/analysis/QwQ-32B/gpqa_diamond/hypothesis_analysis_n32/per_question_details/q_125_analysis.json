The first excited state is n=1, second excited is n=2, third excited is n=3. So the energy of the third excited state would be when n=3. Plugging into the formula: E = (3 + 3/2)\u0127\u03c9 = (9/2)\u0127\u03c9. Hmm, that matches option A and C's energy. But then the question also asks for the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (i.e., the degeneracy) for that energy.\n\nThe degeneracy of each energy level in the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is determined by the number of different combinations of (n_x, n_y, n_z) that add up to n. Since each n_i is a non-negative integer, the number of such combinations is (n + 1)(n + 2)/2.",
