Since P_z is diagonal, this simplifies to sum over i of (P_z)_{i,i} |\u03c8_i|\u00b2. \n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst component: (\u0127)*( (-1/2)^2 ) = \u0127*(1/4)\nSecond component: 0*( (1/\u221a2)^2 ) = 0\nThird component: (-\u0127)*( (-1/2)^2 ) = -\u0127*(1/4)\n\nAdding them together: (\u0127/4) + 0 - (\u0127/4) = 0. So \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is zero?\n\nHmm, interesting. Now, what about \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9? Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared would just be the square of the diagonal entries. The matrix for P_z squared would have (\u0127)^2, 0^2, (-\u0127)^2 on the diagonal. So the eigenvalues are \u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is the sum of (P_z squared's diagonal elements multiplied by |\u03c8_i|\u00b2):\n\nFirst term: (\u0127\u00b2)*(1/4)\nSecond term: 0*(1/2) = 0\nThird term: (\u0127\u00b2)*(1/4)\n\nAdding these gives (\u0127\u00b2/4 + \u0127\u00b2/4) = \u0127\u00b2/2.\n\nTherefore, the uncertainty squared is \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2 = (\u0127\u00b2/2) - 0 = \u0127\u00b2/2.

The first term is (1/4)*\u0127, third term (1/4)*(-\u0127), so they cancel. The second term is zero. Yep. So \u27e8P_z\u27e9 = 0.\n\nNow, moving on to \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared would just be the square of its diagonal entries.

The matrix for P_z squared would then have diagonal entries (\u0127)^2, 0^2=0, (-\u0127)^2=\u0127\u00b2. So the expectation value of P_z squared would be the sum over components squared times the squared eigenvalues.\n\nSo:\n\nFirst term: (-1/2)^2 * (\u0127)^2 = (1/4) * \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSecond term: (1/\u221a2)^2 * 0\u00b2 = 0.\n\nThird term: (-1/2)^2 * (\u0127)^2 (since (-\u0127)^2 is \u0127\u00b2) \u2192 (1/4) * \u0127\u00b2.\n\nAdding those: (1/4 + 1/4) * \u0127\u00b2 = (1/2)\u0127\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 = (1/2)\u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo now, the uncertainty squared is \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - (\u27e8P_z\u27e9)^2 = (1/2 \u0127\u00b2) - 0 = 1/2 \u0127\u00b2.\n\nTaking the square root gives \u0394P_z = sqrt(1/2) \u0127 = \u0127 / sqrt(2).",

So the diagonal entries are (\u0127)^2, 0^2=0, and (-\u0127)^2 = \u0127\u00b2. So P_z squared matrix is:\n\n[ \u0127\u00b2 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 \u0127\u00b2 ]\n\nSo the expectation value is calculated similarly:\n\nFirst term: (\u03c8\u2081)^2 * \u0127\u00b2 = (1/4) \u0127\u00b2\n\nSecond term: (1/\u221a2)^2 * 0 = 0\n\nThird term: (\u03c8\u2083)^2 * \u0127\u00b2 (since (-\u0127)^2 is \u0127\u00b2). The third component squared is (1/2)^2 = 1/4, so 1/4 * \u0127\u00b2.\n\nAdding those terms: (1/4 + 1/4) * \u0127\u00b2 = (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 = (1/2)\u0127\u00b2.\n\nNow, the uncertainty squared is \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2 = (1/2 \u0127\u00b2) - (0)^2 = 1/2 \u0127\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, the uncertainty \u0394P_z is sqrt(1/2 \u0127\u00b2) = (\u0127) / sqrt(2). \n\nLooking at the options, option B is \u0127/sqrt(2). So the answer should be B.",
          "text2": "Wait, that's interesting. So the expectation value \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is zero?\n\nHmm, that seems correct based on the calculation. Let me check again. The first term is (1/4)*\u0127, third term (1/4)*(-\u0127), so they cancel. The second term is zero. Yep. So \u27e8P_z\u27e9 = 0.\n\nNow, moving on to \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared would just be the square of its diagonal entries. So the diagonal entries of P_z squared would be (\u0127)^2, 0^2, (-\u0127)^2, which are \u0127\u00b2, 0, and \u0127\u00b2 respectively.\n\nSo similar to before, \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is the sum of \u03c8_i squared times (P_z squared)_ii.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst component: (-1/2)^2 * (\u0127\u00b2) = (1/4)\u0127\u00b2\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)^2 * 0 = 0\n\nThird component: (-1/2)^2 * (\u0127\u00b2) = (1/4)\u0127\u00b2\n\nAdding those terms: (1/4 + 1/4) \u0127\u00b2 = (1/2)\u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is (1/2)\u0127\u00b2.\n\nNow the uncertainty squared is \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - (\u27e8P_z\u27e9)^2 = (1/2 \u0127\u00b2) - (0)^2 = 1/2 \u0127\u00b2. Therefore, the uncertainty \u0394P_z is sqrt(1/2) \u0127, which is \u0127 divided by sqrt(2).",
