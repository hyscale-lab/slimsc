          "text1": "Wait, Kepler's third law in the case of a planet orbiting a star states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a), so P\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3/(M_total). Since the stars have the same mass as the Sun, and the planet masses are similar to Neptune, which is much less than the star's mass, the M_total can be approximated as just the star's mass. So, the dominant term would be M_* (the star's mass), so P\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3. \n\nBut how does the radial velocity relate to the period and the semi-major axis?\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K (the amplitude of the star's velocity variation) is given by:\n\nK = (v sin i) / (1 + m_p/M_* )\n\nwhere v is the orbital velocity of the star around the center of mass, and m_p is the planet's mass. Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star, the denominator is approximately 1, so K \u2248 v sin i.\n\nThe orbital velocity of the star, v, can be related to the planet's orbital parameters. Let's consider that both the star and the planet orbit around their common center of mass. The separation between the star and the planet is a (the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit). The star's orbital radius is a*(m_p/(M_* + m_p)). Again, since m_p is much less than M_*, this becomes approximately a*(m_p/M_*). \n\nThe star's orbital speed v is given by v = 2\u03c0 R_*/P, where R_* is the star's orbital radius. Substituting R_* \u2248 (a m_p)/(M_*), so v \u2248 (2\u03c0 a m_p)/(M_* P). \n\nThen the radial velocity K \u2248 v sin i = (2\u03c0 a m_p sin i)/(M_* P).\n\nBut we also know from Kepler's third law that (P\u00b2 a\u00b3) = (4\u03c0\u00b2/G(M_* + m_p)) a\u00b3. Since m_p << M_*, this simplifies to P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2/G M_*) a\u00b3 \u2192 a\u00b3 = (G M_* /4\u03c0\u00b2) P\u00b2 \u2192 a = [ (G M_* /4\u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/3) ) ] P^(2/3).\n\nHmm, maybe substituting a in terms of P into the K equation would be better. Let me rearrange the Kepler's equation first.",
          "text2": "Wait, maybe I need to recall Kepler's third law here. Let's think again.\n\nKepler's third law states that the orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a by P\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3/(M + m), where M is the star's mass and m the planet's. But since the star is much more massive, M + m \u2248 M. So P\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3 / M. \n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K (the maximum velocity of the star) can be related to the planet's orbit parameters. The star and planet orbit their common center of mass. The star's orbital speed v is given by v = (2\u03c0 a_s)/P, where a_s is the star's semi-major axis. The amplitude K is this velocity. \n\nThe center of mass condition gives M_s * a_s = M_p * a_p, so a_s = (M_p / M_s) * a_p. Since the total separation between the two is a = a_p + a_s = a_p (1 + M_p/M_s). But again, if M_p << M_s, then a \u2248 a_p, so a_s \u2248 (M_p / M_s) * a. \n\nBut maybe it's better to express K in terms of the planet's parameters.

Assuming circular orbits, v_p = sqrt(G(M_star + M_p)/a). \n\nBut since M_p << M_star, we can approximate M_p + M_star \u2248 M_star, so v_p \u2248 sqrt(G M_star / a). \n\nThen K \u2248 (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G M_star / a) ) = (M_p / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G/(a)) \n\nHmm, but maybe I should use Kepler's third law here. \n\nKepler's third law states that (M_star + M_p) * a\u00b3 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / G) * P\u00b2 \n\nAgain, since M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate (M_star + M_p) \u2248 M_star, so:\n\na\u00b3 \u2248 (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G M_star)) P\u00b2 \n\nTherefore, a \u2248 ( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G M_star))^(1/3) ) * P^(2/3)\n\nNow, the radial velocity K of the star is related to its orbital speed. The star's orbital speed is v_star = (a_star) * (2 \u03c0 / P), where a_star is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the center of mass. \n\nThe star's semi-major axis a_star is (a * M_p) / (M_star + M_p). Again, since M_p << M_star, this simplifies to a * M_p / M_star. \n\nTherefore, v_star = (a * M_p / M_star) * (2 \u03c0 / P) \n\nBut K is the maximum velocity (radial component) of the star, so assuming sin i = 1 (since inclination is unknown, but since the problem doesn't mention it, perhaps the shifts are maximum, so sin i =1, so we can ignore that factor for the ratio). \n\nThus, K = (a M_p / (M_star)) * (2 \u03c0 / P )\n\nNow, substitute a from Kepler's law.

Maybe there's a better way to get the ratio of periods. Let me consider the ratio of K1/K2 and relate it to the periods. \n\nLet me denote the parameters for planet 1 as subscript 1 and planet 2 as 2. \n\nWe need to find P2/P1. \n\nGiven that both stars have the same mass (M), and the planets have similar masses (so M_p1 \u2248 M_p2 = M_p). \n\nThe radial velocity shifts are K1 and K2, given as 5 and 7 miliangstroms. The actual values of K (in velocity terms) would be proportional to the wavelength shifts. But since the spectral lines are at the same wavelength (the problem says \"the same spectral line at a given wavelength\"), then the Doppler shift formula applies. \n\nThe radial velocity K is related to the wavelength shift. The formula for the Doppler shift is:\n\n\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb = v / c \n\nWhere v is the velocity component along the line of sight, and c is the speed of light. \n\nThus, the velocity K (in m/s) is K = (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb) * c. \n\nBut since both spectral lines are at the same wavelength, the ratio of K1/K2 will be the same as the ratio of their \u0394\u03bb. Because (\u0394\u03bb1/\u03bb) / (\u0394\u03bb2/\u03bb) = \u0394\u03bb1/\u0394\u03bb2. So K1/K2 = 5/7. \n\nTherefore, K1/K2 = 5/7. \n\nWe need to relate this ratio to the orbital periods. \n\nLet me go back to the relation between K and P. \n\nLooking back, let me try to find an expression that relates K and P. \n\nTaking the K equation and solving for P.

Since the stars have the same mass as the Sun, and the planet masses are similar to Neptune, which is much less than the star's mass, the M_total can be approximated as just the star's mass. So, the dominant term would be M_* (the star's mass), so P\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3. \n\nBut how does the radial velocity relate to the period and the semi-major axis?\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K (the amplitude of the star's velocity variation) is given by:\n\nK = (v sin i) / (1 + m_p/M_* )\n\nwhere v is the orbital velocity of the star around the center of mass, and m_p is the planet's mass.

The actual values of K (in velocity terms) would be proportional to the wavelength shifts. But since the spectral lines are at the same wavelength (the problem says \"the same spectral line at a given wavelength\"), then the Doppler shift formula applies. \n\nThe radial velocity K is related to the wavelength shift. The formula for the Doppler shift is:\n\n\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb = v / c \n\nWhere v is the velocity component along the line of sight, and c is the speed of light. \n\nThus, the velocity K (in m/s) is K = (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb) * c. \n\nBut since both spectral lines are at the same wavelength, the ratio of K1/K2 will be the same as the ratio of their \u0394\u03bb.

Since the stars have the same mass as the Sun, and the planet masses are similar to Neptune, which is much less than the star's mass, the M_total can be approximated as just the star's mass. So, the dominant term would be M_* (the star's mass), so P\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3. \n\nBut how does the radial velocity relate to the period and the semi-major axis?\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K (the amplitude of the star's velocity variation) is given by:\n\nK = (v sin i) / (1 + m_p/M_* )\n\nwhere v is the orbital velocity of the star around the center of mass, and m_p is the planet's mass.

Let's consider that both the star and the planet orbit around their common center of mass. The separation between the star and the planet is a (the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit). The star's orbital radius is a*(m_p/(M_* + m_p)). Again, since m_p is much less than M_*, this becomes approximately a*(m_p/M_*). \n\nThe star's orbital speed v is given by v = 2\u03c0 R_*/P, where R_* is the star's orbital radius.

The actual values of K (in velocity terms) would be proportional to the wavelength shifts. But since the spectral lines are at the same wavelength (the problem says \"the same spectral line at a given wavelength\"), then the Doppler shift formula applies. \n\nThe radial velocity K is related to the wavelength shift. The formula for the Doppler shift is:\n\n\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb = v / c \n\nWhere v is the velocity component along the line of sight, and c is the speed of light. \n\nThus, the velocity K (in m/s) is K = (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb) * c. \n\nBut since both spectral lines are at the same wavelength, the ratio of K1/K2 will be the same as the ratio of their \u0394\u03bb.

So K is proportional to the Doppler shift. \n\nThe Doppler shift in wavelength \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = v/c, where v is the velocity. Since both shifts are given in the same units (miliangstrom), and the original wavelength is the same (same spectral line), then the ratio of the shifts (\u0394\u03bb1/\u0394\u03bb2) would be equal to v1/v2.
