Let\u2019s denote f(p) dp = number of stars between p and p+dp. The volume between d=1/p and d=1/(p+dp) is approximately (4\u03c0/3)[(1/p)^3 - (1/(p+dp))^3]. But for small dp, the difference can be approximated as derivative. The volume derivative dV/dd = 4\u03c0 d\u00b2. So dV = 4\u03c0 d\u00b2 dd. But since p = 1/d, then d = 1/p and dd = d\u00b2 dp (as before). Therefore, dV = 4\u03c0 (1/p\u00b2) * ( (1/p\u00b2) dp ) ) = 4\u03c0 (1/p^4) dp. So the volume element is proportional to 1/p^4 dp. Since the number of stars is proportional to the volume (assuming uniform density), then yes, f(p) ~ 1/p^4. Hence, the correct answer must be A.",

So, the volume element in terms of p is 4\u03c0 d\u00b2 * (d\u00b2 dp) = 4 \u03c0 d^4 dp.
