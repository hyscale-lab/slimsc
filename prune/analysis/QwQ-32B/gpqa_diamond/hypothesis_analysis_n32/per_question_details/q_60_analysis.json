Let me structure this step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the time it takes from the perspective of someone in the Large Magellanic Cloud (the rest frame). Let's call that T. Then, using time dilation, the astronaut's own experienced time (proper time) would be shorter due to their high speed.\n\nSo, T = D / v. The distance D is 160,000 light-years. The speed v is 0.99999987c. So T would be (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987c). Since the units are in light-years and speed of light, the time in years would be D divided by (v/c), because (v/c) is the fraction of the speed of light. \n\nSo T = 160,000 / 0.99999987 \u2248 approximately 160,000 / 1, since 0.99999987 is almost 1.

That's really close to the speed of light. The astronaut's own lifetime is about 150 solar years, but the question is how long their journey takes from the astronaut's perspective. Since they're moving at such a high speed, time dilation would make the travel time much shorter for them compared to the Earth's frame of reference. \n\nSo the key here is to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut during the trip.

The square root of 2.6 is about 1.61, and sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is 0.0003162.

Since x is small, x\u00b2 is negligible, so \u2248 2x. So here, x is 1.3e-7 (since 1 - v/c is 0.00000013). Therefore, 1 - (v/c)^2 \u2248 2.6e-7, as before. So that part is correct.\n\nSo gamma is 1/sqrt(2.6e-7). Let me compute sqrt(2.6e-7) precisely.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(2.6) = approx 1.61245155.\n\nsqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5 = ~0.000316227766.\n\nSo sqrt(2.6e-7) = 1.61245 * 0.000316227766 \u2248 let's compute:\n\n1.61245 * 0.000316227766:\n\nFirst, 1 * 0.000316227766 = 0.000316227766.\n\n0.6 * 0.000316227766 = 0.00018973666.\n\n0.01245 * 0.000316227766 \u2248 0.000003943.\n\nAdding these: 0.000316227766 +0.00018973666 = 0.000505964 + 0.000003943 \u2248 0.000509907.\n\nSo sqrt(2.6e-7) \u2248 0.000509907, so gamma is 1 / 0.000509907 \u2248 1961.4.\n\nThus, gamma is approximately 1961.4.\n\nThen, t = D/v = 163000 / 0.99999987 \u2248 163000.00221. So approx 163000 years.\n\nTherefore, tau = t / gamma = 163000 / 1961.4 \u2248 let me compute that division.\n\nLet me do 1961.4 \u00d7 80 = 156,912.\n\n1961.4 \u00d7 83 = 1961.4 \u00d780 + 1961.4 \u00d73 = 156,912 + 5,884.2 = 162,796.2.\n\nHmm, 162,796.2 is less than 163,000. The difference is 203.8.\n\nEach 1 unit of multiplier adds 1961.4, so 203.8/1961.4 \u2248 ~0.104.\n\nSo total multiplier is 83.104. So \u03c4 \u2248 83.1 years.\n\nHmm, so about 83 years, but the options don't have that. The closest is 81 (C) or 77 (D).",
          "text2": "Alternatively, let me compute numerically.\n\nLet me compute 1 - (v/c)^2 exactly. Let me write v/c = 0.99999987. Then (v/c)^2 = (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute this as follows:\n\nLet me compute (1 - 1.3e-7)^2. Let me expand this using (a - b)^2 = a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2. Here a=1, b=1.3e-7. \n\nThus, (1 -1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2. Since (1.3e-7)^2 is 1.69e-14, which is negligible compared to the other terms. \n\nSo 1 - (v/c)^2 \u2248 2*(1.3e-7) = 2.6e-7. So that's correct. So gamma is 1/sqrt(2.6e-7). \n\nCalculating sqrt(2.6e-7):\n\nLet me compute sqrt(2.6e-7):\n\nLet me note that sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6)*sqrt(1e-7). sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is 3.1623e-4. sqrt(2.6) is approximately 1.612. So multiplying 1.612 * 3.1623e-4 \u2248 1.612*3.162 is roughly 5.1 (since 1.6*3=4.8, 1.6*0.16=0.256, so ~5.056, plus 0.012*3.16 ~0.038, so total ~5.094). So 5.094e-4. So 1 divided by that is 1 / 5.094e-4 \u2248 1963. So gamma is approximately 1963. \n\nOkay, so gamma is about 1963. That means that the time experienced by the astronaut is the Earth's frame time divided by gamma.",

In Earth's frame, the spacecraft travels at 0.99999987c. So the time taken from Earth's perspective would be distance divided by speed. Let me compute that first.\n\nSo distance d = 163,000 light-years. Speed v = 0.99999987c. So time t (Earth's time) would be d / v = (163,000 ly) / (0.99999987c).

Let me compute (0.99999987)^2 precisely.\n\nLet me do it step by step. Let's write 0.99999987 as 1 - 1.3e-7. Then, (1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a\u00b2. a is 1.3e-7, so a\u00b2 is (1.3)^2 * 1e-14 = 1.69e-14, which is negligible. So 1 - (v/c)^2 \u2248 2a = 2 * 1.3e-7 = 2.6e-7. So sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) is sqrt(2.6e-7). Let me compute sqrt(2.6e-7):\n\nsqrt(2.6) is about 1.612. So sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6) * sqrt(1e-7) = 1.612 * 1e-3.5. 1e-3.5 is 3.162e-4, so 1.612 * 3.162 \u2248 5.1, so 5.1e-4. Therefore, the denominator is 5.1e-4. So gamma is 1 / 5.1e-4 \u2248 1960.78. So that's correct. So gamma is ~1960.8.\n\nNow, Earth's time t is D / v. D is 163000 light-years. So t = 163000 / 0.99999987 \u2248 ~163000 years (since 0.99999987 is so close to 1, the division is almost 163000). So the astronaut's time \u03c4 = t / gamma \u2248 163000 / 1960.8 \u2248 let's compute this division again.\n\n163000 divided by 1960. Let me compute 1960 x 80 = 156,800. 163,000 minus 156,800 is 6,200. 1960 x 3 = 5,880, so 83 total (80+3) leaves 6,200 - 5,880 = 320. 320 / 1960 \u2248 0.163. So total is 83.16 years.

So approximately 1 - 0.00000026. \n\nTherefore, 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 \u2248 0.00000026. So sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) \u2248 sqrt(0.00000026). Let me compute sqrt(2.6e-7). The square root of 2.6 is about 1.61, and sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is 0.0003162. So 1.61 * 0.0003162 \u2248 0.000509. \n\nSo sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) is approximately 0.000509. \n\nNow, the time in Earth's frame is D/(v).

So sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6) * sqrt(1e-7) = 1.612 * 1e-3.5. 1e-3.5 is 3.162e-4, so 1.612 * 3.162 \u2248 5.1, so 5.1e-4. Therefore, the denominator is 5.1e-4. So gamma is 1 / 5.1e-4 \u2248 1960.78.

So approximately 1 - 0.00000026. \n\nTherefore, 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 \u2248 0.00000026. So sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) \u2248 sqrt(0.00000026). Let me compute sqrt(2.6e-7). The square root of 2.6 is about 1.61, and sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is 0.0003162.

The distance D is 160,000 light-years. The speed v is 0.99999987c. So T_earth = D / v = (160,000 light-years) / (0.99999987c) \u2248 160,000 / 1 (since 0.99999987 is almost 1).

So gamma is 1/sqrt(2.6e-7). \n\nCalculating sqrt(2.6e-7):\n\nLet me compute sqrt(2.6e-7):\n\nLet me note that sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6)*sqrt(1e-7). sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is 3.1623e-4. sqrt(2.6) is approximately 1.612. So multiplying 1.612 * 3.1623e-4 \u2248 1.612*3.162 is roughly 5.1 (since 1.6*3=4.8, 1.6*0.16=0.256, so ~5.056, plus 0.012*3.16 ~0.038, so total ~5.094). So 5.094e-4. So 1 divided by that is 1 / 5.094e-4 \u2248 1963. So gamma is approximately 1963. \n\nOkay, so gamma is about 1963.
