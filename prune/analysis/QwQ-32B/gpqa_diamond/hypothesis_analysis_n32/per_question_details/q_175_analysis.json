Because the total power would be (dP/d\u03a9) averaged over angles multiplied by the total solid angle, but the angular dependence is separate.

Let me think:\n\nThe electric dipole has an electric field proportional to sin\u03b8 in the radiation zone, so the power (which is proportional to |E|\u00b2) is proportional to sin\u00b2\u03b8. \n\nThe magnetic dipole, on the other hand, has a radiation pattern where the power is proportional to cos\u00b2\u03b8. Because the magnetic dipole's radiation is due to the magnetic moment, which when aligned along the z-axis, the radiation is maximum along the axis.\n\nYes! So for a magnetic dipole oriented along the z-axis, the radiation intensity (power per solid angle) is proportional to cos\u00b2\u03b8. The maximum is at \u03b8=0 (along the axis), and it's zero at \u03b8=90 degrees. \n\nAh! That changes everything. Because the problem states that the maximum is along the z-axis. So if the dipole is a magnetic dipole, then the angular dependence is cos\u00b2\u03b8. So the fraction at \u03b8=30 degrees would be (cos\u00b230)/ (cos\u00b20) = ( (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) / 1 = (3/4)/1 \u2192 3/4 of the maximum A. So the fraction is 3/4. \n\nThe dependence on wavelength for a dipole (either electric or magnetic) is proportional to (omega)^4, so since omega = 2\u03c0c/lambda, the power is proportional to (c/lambda)^4 \u2192 1/lambda^4. Thus, the function f would include a 1/lambda^4 term. \n\nSo putting it together, the fraction is 3/4, and the form of f is proportional to 1/lambda^4. Looking at the options:\n\nOption D says 3/4 and lambda^-6. Option C is 1/4 and lambda^-4. Option D's lambda term is -6, which would be for a quadrupole.

Since \u03c9 = 2\u03c0f, so \u03c9^4 is proportional to f^4. Since the wavelength \u03bb is related to frequency by c = \u03bb f, so f = c / \u03bb. Therefore \u03c9^4 is proportional to (c^4)/(\u03bb^4). Therefore, substituting back, the U(\u03b8) would have a term proportional to 1/\u03bb^4 multiplied by sin^2\u03b8. \n\nTherefore the function f (the dependence on \u03bb and \u03b8) would have the \u03bb^-4 term. The angular dependence is sin\u00b2\u03b8, so when the question says \"a possible form of f are...\", since f is the function that the power is proportional to, then f must include both the angular part and the wavelength dependence. So the power per solid angle is proportional to sin\u00b2\u03b8 * \u03bb^-4. \n\nTherefore, the fraction at angle 30 degrees would be sin\u00b2(30\u00b0) / sin\u00b2(90\u00b0) because the maximum is at theta=90 degrees. Since sin(30) is 0.5, squared is 0.25, so the fraction is 1/4. And the function f has \u03bb^-4. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 1/4 and \u03bb^-4, which matches.

Since \u03c9 = 2\u03c0f, so \u03c9^4 is proportional to f^4. Since the wavelength \u03bb is related to frequency by c = \u03bb f, so f = c / \u03bb. Therefore \u03c9^4 is proportional to (c^4)/(\u03bb^4). Therefore, substituting back, the U(\u03b8) would have a term proportional to 1/\u03bb^4 multiplied by sin^2\u03b8. \n\nTherefore the function f (the dependence on \u03bb and \u03b8) would have the \u03bb^-4 term.

The maximum is at \u03b8=0 (along the axis), and it's zero at \u03b8=90 degrees. \n\nAh! That changes everything. Because the problem states that the maximum is along the z-axis.

Since \u03c9 = 2\u03c0f, so \u03c9^4 is proportional to f^4. Since the wavelength \u03bb is related to frequency by c = \u03bb f, so f = c / \u03bb. Therefore \u03c9^4 is proportional to (c^4)/(\u03bb^4). Therefore, substituting back, the U(\u03b8) would have a term proportional to 1/\u03bb^4 multiplied by sin^2\u03b8. \n\nTherefore the function f (the dependence on \u03bb and \u03b8) would have the \u03bb^-4 term.

Since the dipole radiation power is proportional to omega^4 (since the second derivative of p would involve omega squared, squared gives omega^4). Therefore, since lambda is proportional to 1/omega, then omega^4 is proportional to (1/lambda)^4. So the dependence on lambda would be lambda^-4. Therefore the function f would have a lambda^-4 term multiplied by sin squared theta. So the form of f would include lambda^-4. \n\nTherefore the correct answer would be option C: 1/4 and lambda^-4.

The angular dependence of the power per solid angle would have the sin\u00b2\u03b8 term. The key point is that the differential power per unit solid angle (dP/d\u03a9) for a dipole is proportional to (1/lambda^4) because the frequency is proportional to 1/lambda, and the power goes with omega^4.
