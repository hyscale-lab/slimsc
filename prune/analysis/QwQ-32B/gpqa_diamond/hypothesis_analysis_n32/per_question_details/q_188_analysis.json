Let me confirm.\n\nYes, I found in some notes that for a rhombohedral system where a = b = c and \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3, the interplanar distance is given by:\n\nd_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nSo that's the formula to use here. \n\nGiven that, the problem is for the (111) plane. So h =1, k=1, l=1. The angle \u03b1 is 30 degrees. The interatomic distance (lattice constant a) is 10 Angstrom. \n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nd = 10 / sqrt( (1^2 + 1^2 +1^2) + 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1)*cos(30\u00b0) )\n\nLet's compute the denominator step by step. \n\nFirst, compute the terms inside the sqrt.\n\nThe first part is h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 = 1 +1 +1 =3.\n\nThe second part is 2*(hk + hl + kl) * cos \u03b1. Since h,k,l are all 1, hk=1*1=1, same for the others. So hk + hl + kl = 3. \n\nTherefore the second term is 2*(3)*cos(30\u00b0). \n\ncos(30\u00b0) is \u221a3/2 \u22480.8660. \n\nSo 2*3*(\u221a3/2) = 3*\u221a3 \u22483*1.732 \u22485.196.\n\nAdding the first part (3) and the second part (5.196) gives 3 +5.196 =8.196.\n\nTherefore the denominator is sqrt(8.196) \u22482.863.\n\nThus, d =10 /2.863 \u22483.493?",

Since h=k=l=1, each term is 2*1*1*cos30\u00b0, so each cross term is 2*(\u221a3/2) = \u221a3. But since there are three of them (hk, hl, kl), the total cross terms sum is 3*(2*(cos30\u00b0))?",

So substituting h=1, k=1, l=1, and \u03b1=30 degrees.\n\nSo plugging into the formula:\n\nd = 10 / sqrt( (1)^2 + (1)^2 + (1)^2 + 2*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1)*cos(30\u00b0) )\n\nLet me compute the denominator step by step.\n\nFirst, the terms inside the sqrt:\n\nThe first part is 1 + 1 +1 = 3.\n\nThen the second part: 2*( (hk + hl + kl) ) * cos \u03b1. The terms inside the parentheses are hk + hl + kl = 1*1 +1*1 +1*1 = 3. So 2*(3)*cos(30\u00b0).\n\nSo total inside the sqrt is 3 + 2*3*(cos30\u00b0).",
