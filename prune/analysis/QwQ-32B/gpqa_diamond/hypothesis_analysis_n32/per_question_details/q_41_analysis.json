In that frame, the light is moving at speed c/n. Now, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. So, to find the speed in the lab frame, we have to apply the velocity addition formula. \n\nIn special relativity, the velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/c\u00b2).

Let me denote:\n\nIn the glass's frame (S'), the light has velocity u' = c/n in the positive direction (same as the direction the glass is moving in the lab frame). The lab frame (S) sees the glass moving at velocity v.

The velocity addition formula in special relativity says that if an object has velocity u in the frame S', which is moving at velocity v relative to frame S, then its velocity u' in frame S is:\n\nu' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c\u00b2 )\n\nSo here, the frame S' is the glass's frame (moving at v relative to the lab frame S). The light's velocity in the glass's frame (S') is u = c/n in the direction of motion (same direction as v). We need to compute u', the velocity in the lab frame.\n\nSo plugging in u = c/n and v is the velocity of the glass (the S' frame) relative to the lab (S). Since the glass is moving towards the observer in the lab, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity, then all velocities are in the same direction, so signs are positive.\n\nSo substituting:\n\nu' = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c\u00b2 )\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\nThe denominator's term (uv)/c\u00b2 is ( (c/n)*v ) / c\u00b2 = v/(n c).",
