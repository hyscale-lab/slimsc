The amount of NaOH added at 25% is 2.5 mL of 0.1 M, so moles of NaOH = 0.0025 L * 0.1 M = 0.00025 mol. \n\nSo, moles of acetic acid remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate formed: 0.00025 mol. \n\nThe total volume at this point is original 40 mL (the diluted solution) plus 2.5 mL of NaOH, so 42.5 mL total. But when calculating concentrations, we can use the ratio since the volume cancels out in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. \n\nThe pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). \n\nThe pKa is -log(Ka) = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. \n\nKa is 1.85x10^-5. Let me see, log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is -4.733, so pKa is 4.733. \n\nSo, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. The log of 1/3 is about -0.477. \n\nSo pH = 4.733 - 0.477 \u2248 4.256. That's around 4.26. That would correspond to the first value in option A (4.26; 8.52) or D (4.57; 6.92). Hmm, so maybe that's the first one. Let me check again.",

So the calculation is correct here, 10 mL of NaOH needed. \n\nSo the equivalence point is at 10 mL of NaOH added. \n\nNow, the question asks for the pH at 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence point volume is 25% of 10 mL, which is 2.5 mL of NaOH added. \n\nAt 25% titration, so before equivalence, there's a buffer solution of acetic acid and its conjugate base (acetate ion).

So [OH-] = 3.28e-6, so pOH is -log(3.28e-6). \n\nCalculating log(3.28e-6): log(3.28)=0.516, so log(3.28e-6)= -6 +0.516 = -5.484 \u2192 pOH is 5.484, so pH is 14-5.484=8.516, which rounds to 8.52. So that matches option A's second value. \n\nNow, let's check the first part: the pH at 25% titration. \n\n25% titration means 25% of the equivalence point volume has been added. The equivalence point was 10 mL, so 25% is 2.5 mL of NaOH added. \n\nAt this point, we have a buffer solution of acetic acid and its conjugate base. Let me calculate the moles of NaOH added. \n\nThe NaOH is 0.1 M, so 2.5 mL (0.0025 L) gives moles = 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 mol. \n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid after dilution were 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. \n\nWhen we add NaOH, it neutralizes the acetic acid: \n\nEach mole of NaOH reacts with 1 mole of acetic acid to form 1 mole of acetate. \n\nSo moles of acetic acid remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. \n\nMoles of acetate formed: 0.00025 mol. \n\nTotal volume now is original 40 mL + 2.5 mL = 42.5 mL = 0.0425 L. \n\nSo the concentrations are: \n\n[Acetic acid] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M \n\n[Acetate] = 0.00025 /0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M \n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. \n\npH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])\n\npKa is -log(Ka) = -log(1.85e-5). \n\nCalculating that: log(1.85) is about 0.2672, so log(1.85e-5) is -4.7328 \u2192 pKa \u2248 4.7328. \n\nSo pH \u2248 4.7328 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647) \n\nThe ratio is (0.005882 / 0.017647) \u2248 0.3333 (since 1/3). \n\nlog(1/3) \u2248 -0.4771 \n\nSo pH \u2248 4.7328 -0.4771 \u2248 4.2557. So approximately 4.26. \n\nWhich matches option A's first value.",

Since equivalence is 10 cm\u00b3 of NaOH, 25% is 2.5 cm\u00b3. So adding 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH to the diluted solution. Let's see what that does.\n\nThe reaction is acetic acid + NaOH \u2192 NaAc + H2O. So moles of NaOH added here are 0.1 M *0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 moles.

But then what about the equivalence point's other options?\n\nHmm, so perhaps my initial mistake was in the first approximation where I assumed x is negligible, but actually the correct way gives 8.52. So equivalence point pH is 8.52. Okay, so the second part is option A's second value. Now, moving on to the first part: pH at 25% titration.\n\n25% titration means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So how much NaOH is added here?\n\nTotal moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.001 moles. 25% of that is 0.00025 moles. So the moles of NaOH added must be 0.00025 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo the volume of the solution at this point is original 40 cm\u00b3 plus 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH, totaling 42.5 cm\u00b3. \n\nBut to find the pH, we can consider the reaction between acetic acid and NaOH. The reaction is 1:1, so moles of acetic acid remaining will be initial moles minus moles of NaOH added. The moles of acetate formed (since NaOH neutralizes acetic acid to acetate) will be equal to the moles of NaOH added.\n\nSo initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol. Moles of NaOH added:0.00025 mol. So moles of acetic acid left: 0.001 -0.00025 =0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate formed:0.00025 mol.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a buffer of acetic acid and acetate.

The moles of acetate will be 0.001 moles (since that's the original acetic acid). The total volume is 40 mL (original solution) + 10 mL (NaOH added) = 50 mL. So concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. \n\nThe acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH-. The Kb for acetate can be calculated as Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25\u00b0C. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) \u2248 5.405e-10. \n\nSo, Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-]/[CH3COO^-]. Let's let x be the concentration of OH- produced. Then, Kb = x\u00b2 / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small (5.4e-10), x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 -x \u22480.02. \n\nSo x\u00b2 \u2248 5.4e-10 * 0.02 \u2192 x\u00b2 = 1.08e-11 \u2192 x = sqrt(1.08e-11) \u2248 1.039e-5.5?",

          "text1": "Wait, no, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid. Since the acetic acid was diluted, but the moles are still 0.001, right? Because when you dilute, the number of moles doesn't change. So the equivalence point volume of NaOH is (0.001 mol)/(0.1 mol/L) = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL. So the equivalence point is at 10 mL of NaOH added. \n\nNow, the question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. So 25% titration means adding 25% of the equivalence volume. Since equivalence is 10 mL, 25% would be 2.5 mL of NaOH added. \n\nFirst, let's handle the 25% titration point. So at that point, how much acetic acid and its conjugate base (acetate) are present?\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) are 0.001 mol. The NaOH added will react with acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio to form acetate (CH3COO^-) and water. The amount of NaOH added at 25% is 2.5 mL of 0.1 M, so moles of NaOH = 0.0025 L * 0.1 M = 0.00025 mol. \n\nSo, moles of acetic acid remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate formed: 0.00025 mol. \n\nThe total volume at this point is original 40 mL (the diluted solution) plus 2.5 mL of NaOH, so 42.5 mL total. But when calculating concentrations, we can use the ratio since the volume cancels out in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. \n\nThe pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). \n\nThe pKa is -log(Ka) = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. \n\nKa is 1.85x10^-5. Let me see, log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is -4.733, so pKa is 4.733. \n\nSo, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. The log of 1/3 is about -0.477. \n\nSo pH = 4.733 - 0.477 \u2248 4.256. That's around 4.26. That would correspond to the first value in option A (4.26; 8.52) or D (4.57; 6.92).

Let me compute the moles of each.\n\nInitial moles of acetic acid (after dilution) is 0.001 mol. \n\nMoles of NaOH added at 2.5 mL: 0.0025 L * 0.1 M = 0.00025 mol. \n\nSo, the reaction is: \n\nCH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COO^- + H2O\n\nSo, moles of acetic acid remaining = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.\n\nMoles of acetate formed = 0.00025 mol. \n\nThe total volume now is the original 40 mL plus 2.5 mL of NaOH, which is 42.5 mL or 0.0425 L. \n\nThe concentrations would be:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 let me calculate that. 0.00075 divided by 0.0425.

Let me calculate the moles of NaOH added. \n\nThe NaOH is 0.1 M, so 2.5 mL (0.0025 L) gives moles = 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 mol. \n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid after dilution were 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. \n\nWhen we add NaOH, it neutralizes the acetic acid: \n\nEach mole of NaOH reacts with 1 mole of acetic acid to form 1 mole of acetate. \n\nSo moles of acetic acid remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. \n\nMoles of acetate formed: 0.00025 mol. \n\nTotal volume now is original 40 mL + 2.5 mL = 42.5 mL = 0.0425 L. \n\nSo the concentrations are: \n\n[Acetic acid] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M \n\n[Acetate] = 0.00025 /0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M \n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. \n\npH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])\n\npKa is -log(Ka) = -log(1.85e-5). \n\nCalculating that: log(1.85) is about 0.2672, so log(1.85e-5) is -4.7328 \u2192 pKa \u2248 4.7328. \n\nSo pH \u2248 4.7328 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647) \n\nThe ratio is (0.005882 / 0.017647) \u2248 0.3333 (since 1/3). \n\nlog(1/3) \u2248 -0.4771 \n\nSo pH \u2248 4.7328 -0.4771 \u2248 4.2557. So approximately 4.26. \n\nWhich matches option A's first value.",

The moles of acetate formed are 0.00025 moles. \n\nSo this is a buffer solution, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. \n\npH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])\n\nThe pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5) \u2248 0.2672 -5 = -4.7328. So pKa is 4.7328. \n\nThe ratio [A-]/[HA] is (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3. So log(1/3) is -0.477. \n\nTherefore pH = 4.7328 -0.477 \u2248 4.2558. So approximately 4.26. That's exactly the first number in option A.",

But then what about the equivalence point's other options?\n\nHmm, so perhaps my initial mistake was in the first approximation where I assumed x is negligible, but actually the correct way gives 8.52. So equivalence point pH is 8.52. Okay, so the second part is option A's second value. Now, moving on to the first part: pH at 25% titration.\n\n25% titration means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So how much NaOH is added here?\n\nTotal moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.001 moles. 25% of that is 0.00025 moles. So the moles of NaOH added must be 0.00025 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo the volume of the solution at this point is original 40 cm\u00b3 plus 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH, totaling 42.5 cm\u00b3. \n\nBut to find the pH, we can consider the reaction between acetic acid and NaOH. The reaction is 1:1, so moles of acetic acid remaining will be initial moles minus moles of NaOH added. The moles of acetate formed (since NaOH neutralizes acetic acid to acetate) will be equal to the moles of NaOH added.\n\nSo initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol. Moles of NaOH added:0.00025 mol. So moles of acetic acid left: 0.001 -0.00025 =0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate formed:0.00025 mol.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a buffer of acetic acid and acetate. The pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\npKa is -log(Ka) = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that.

Let me do 1.85. Let me compute it precisely. \n\nLog(1.85) = log(1.8) + log(1.85/1.8). Since 1.85 is 1.8*(1.85/1.8). The difference is 0.05/1.8 ~ 0.0278.

Let's let x be the concentration of OH- produced. Then, Kb = x\u00b2 / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small (5.4e-10), x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 -x \u22480.02. \n\nSo x\u00b2 \u2248 5.4e-10 * 0.02 \u2192 x\u00b2 = 1.08e-11 \u2192 x = sqrt(1.08e-11) \u2248 1.039e-5.5?",

Because when you dilute, the number of moles doesn't change. So the equivalence point volume of NaOH is (0.001 mol)/(0.1 mol/L) = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL. So the equivalence point is at 10 mL of NaOH added. \n\nNow, the question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. So 25% titration means adding 25% of the equivalence volume. Since equivalence is 10 mL, 25% would be 2.5 mL of NaOH added. \n\nFirst, let's handle the 25% titration point. So at that point, how much acetic acid and its conjugate base (acetate) are present?\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) are 0.001 mol. The NaOH added will react with acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio to form acetate (CH3COO^-) and water.

Let me calculate that. \n\nKa is 1.85x10^-5. Let me see, log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is -4.733, so pKa is 4.733. \n\nSo, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3.

Let me do 1.85. Let me compute it precisely. \n\nLog(1.85) = log(1.8) + log(1.85/1.8). Since 1.85 is 1.8*(1.85/1.8). The difference is 0.05/1.8 ~ 0.0278. So log(1.85) \u2248 log(1.8) + (0.0278)*(derivative of log at 1.8). The derivative of log(x) is 1/(x ln10). At x=1.8: 1/(1.8*2.3026) \u2248 1/(4.144) \u2248 0.241. So the increase is approx 0.0278 *0.241 \u22480.0067. So log(1.8) is 0.2553, plus 0.0067 gives 0.262. So log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5)= 0.262 -5 = -4.738. So pKa is 4.738. \n\nSo pH = 4.738 + log( (0.00025)/(0.00075) ) = 4.738 + log(1/3). Log(1/3) is -0.4771. So total pH is 4.738 -0.4771 = 4.2609, so about 4.26. That's matching option A's first value. \n\nNow, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. The moles of acetate will be 0.001 moles (since that's the original acetic acid). The total volume is 40 mL (original solution) + 10 mL (NaOH added) = 50 mL. So concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. \n\nThe acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH-. The Kb for acetate can be calculated as Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25\u00b0C. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) \u2248 5.405e-10. \n\nSo, Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-]/[CH3COO^-]. Let's let x be the concentration of OH- produced. Then, Kb = x\u00b2 / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small (5.4e-10), x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 -x \u22480.02. \n\nSo x\u00b2 \u2248 5.4e-10 * 0.02 \u2192 x\u00b2 = 1.08e-11 \u2192 x = sqrt(1.08e-11) \u2248 1.039e-5.5?",

The difference between log(1.8) and log(1.9): \n\nlog(1.8)=0.2553, log(1.9)=0.2788. \n\nThe difference is 0.0235 over 0.1 increase in the number (from 1.8 to 1.9). \n\n1.85 is 0.05 above 1.8, so 0.05/0.1 = 0.5 of the interval. \n\nSo 0.2553 + 0.5*(0.0235) = 0.2553 + 0.01175 = 0.267. \n\nThus log(1.85) \u22480.267. \n\nSo log(1.85e-5)= log(1.85)+log(1e-5)= 0.267 -5 = -4.733. \n\nThus pKa is 4.733. \n\nSo pH = 4.733 + log( (0.00025 / 0.0425) / (0.00075 / 0.0425) ) \n\nThe denominators (0.0425) cancel out. So log( (0.00025)/(0.00075) ) = log(1/3) = log(0.333...) \n\nlog(1/3) is -0.477. \n\nThus pH = 4.733 - 0.477 \u2248 4.256. \n\nSo approximately 4.26. \n\nHmm, so that would be the first pH value. \n\nNow, the equivalence point. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. The moles of acetate here would be 0.001 mol (same as initial acetic acid). \n\nThe total volume is the initial 40 mL plus the 10 mL of NaOH (since equivalence is at 10 mL). So total volume is 50 mL = 0.05 L. \n\nThe concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. \n\nNow, to find the pH of the solution at equivalence point, we need to calculate the pH of the acetate ion solution. Since acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, it will hydrolyze in water: \n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^- \n\nThe Kb for the acetate ion can be found by Kw / Ka. \n\nKw at 25\u00b0C is 1e-14. \n\nKa =1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) \u2248 5.405e-10. \n\nThe Kb is very small, so the solution will be basic. \n\nThe concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. \n\nLet me set up the expression. Let\u2019s denote [OH-] as x. \n\nThe Kb expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-]/[CH3COO^-] \n\nInitially, [CH3COO^-] is 0.02, and [CH3COOH] and [OH-] are 0. \n\nAt equilibrium, [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 -x, [CH3COOH] =x, [OH-]=x. \n\nAssuming x is very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 -x \u22480.02. \n\nThen: \n\nKb \u2248 x\u00b2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 \n\nSolving for x: x\u00b2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 \n\nx = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5.5?",

So 0.5405e-9 is 5.405e-10, which is correct. \n\nThen, Kb = 5.405e-10. \n\nThen, using x^2 /0.02 = 5.405e-10 \u2192 x^2 = 5.405e-10 *0.02 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x = sqrt(1.081e-11).

The equivalence point was 10 mL, so 25% is 2.5 mL of NaOH added. \n\nAt this point, we have a buffer solution of acetic acid and its conjugate base. Let me calculate the moles of NaOH added. \n\nThe NaOH is 0.1 M, so 2.5 mL (0.0025 L) gives moles = 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 mol. \n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid after dilution were 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. \n\nWhen we add NaOH, it neutralizes the acetic acid: \n\nEach mole of NaOH reacts with 1 mole of acetic acid to form 1 mole of acetate. \n\nSo moles of acetic acid remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. \n\nMoles of acetate formed: 0.00025 mol. \n\nTotal volume now is original 40 mL + 2.5 mL = 42.5 mL = 0.0425 L. \n\nSo the concentrations are: \n\n[Acetic acid] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M \n\n[Acetate] = 0.00025 /0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M \n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. \n\npH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])\n\npKa is -log(Ka) = -log(1.85e-5). \n\nCalculating that: log(1.85) is about 0.2672, so log(1.85e-5) is -4.7328 \u2192 pKa \u2248 4.7328. \n\nSo pH \u2248 4.7328 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647) \n\nThe ratio is (0.005882 / 0.017647) \u2248 0.3333 (since 1/3). \n\nlog(1/3) \u2248 -0.4771 \n\nSo pH \u2248 4.7328 -0.4771 \u2248 4.2557.

So equivalence point pH is 8.52, so the second value in the options. Looking at the options: option A is 4.26;8.52, which would mean that the equivalence point is 8.52, which matches this. But then what about the equivalence point's other options?\n\nHmm, so perhaps my initial mistake was in the first approximation where I assumed x is negligible, but actually the correct way gives 8.52. So equivalence point pH is 8.52. Okay, so the second part is option A's second value. Now, moving on to the first part: pH at 25% titration.\n\n25% titration means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So how much NaOH is added here?\n\nTotal moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.001 moles. 25% of that is 0.00025 moles. So the moles of NaOH added must be 0.00025 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo the volume of the solution at this point is original 40 cm\u00b3 plus 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH, totaling 42.5 cm\u00b3. \n\nBut to find the pH, we can consider the reaction between acetic acid and NaOH. The reaction is 1:1, so moles of acetic acid remaining will be initial moles minus moles of NaOH added. The moles of acetate formed (since NaOH neutralizes acetic acid to acetate) will be equal to the moles of NaOH added.\n\nSo initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol. Moles of NaOH added:0.00025 mol. So moles of acetic acid left: 0.001 -0.00025 =0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate formed:0.00025 mol.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a buffer of acetic acid and acetate.

So log(1/3)=log(0.333)\u2248-0.477. \n\nThus pH =4.7328 -0.477 \u22484.256. That rounds to approximately 4.26. Which matches the first part of option A. So the answer would be option A: 4.26;8.52.",

Option A's equivalence pH is 8.52, so that's possible. But let's check the 25% titration part.\n\nNow, the first part is the pH at 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence point volume. Since equivalence point is at 10 mL NaOH, 25% would be 2.5 mL added. Let me confirm: equivalence is 10 mL, so 25% is 2.5 mL. \n\nAt this point, the reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is:\n\nCH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O\n\nThe moles of NaOH added here would be 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. \n\nInitial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 moles (from before). After adding 0.00025 moles NaOH, the moles of acetic acid remaining are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. The moles of acetate formed are 0.00025 moles. \n\nThe total volume is 40 mL (original) + 2.5 mL (NaOH) = 42.5 mL = 0.0425 L. \n\nThis is a buffer solution, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. \n\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\npKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let's compute that. \n\nlog(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + (-5). log(1.85) is about 0.267. So log(1.85e-5) \u2248 -4.733 \u2192 pKa \u2248 4.733. \n\nThen, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is (0.00025 / 0.0425) divided by (0.00075 / 0.0425) \u2192 which simplifies to (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3. \n\nSo log(1/3) \u2248 -0.477. \n\nThus pH = 4.733 -0.477 \u2248 4.256. So around 4.26. \n\nLooking at the options: Option A has 4.26 and 8.52, which matches these numbers. So that would be the answer.",

But let's check the 25% titration part. \n\nAt 25% titration, that's 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH added. Let's see how much acetic acid and acetate are present. \n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol (from earlier).

          "text1": "Wait, no, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid. Since the acetic acid was diluted, but the moles are still 0.001, right? Because when you dilute, the number of moles doesn't change. So the equivalence point volume of NaOH is (0.001 mol)/(0.1 mol/L) = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL. So the equivalence point is at 10 mL of NaOH added. \n\nNow, the question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. So 25% titration means adding 25% of the equivalence volume. Since equivalence is 10 mL, 25% would be 2.5 mL of NaOH added. \n\nFirst, let's handle the 25% titration point. So at that point, how much acetic acid and its conjugate base (acetate) are present?\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) are 0.001 mol. The NaOH added will react with acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio to form acetate (CH3COO^-) and water. The amount of NaOH added at 25% is 2.5 mL of 0.1 M, so moles of NaOH = 0.0025 L * 0.1 M = 0.00025 mol. \n\nSo, moles of acetic acid remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate formed: 0.00025 mol. \n\nThe total volume at this point is original 40 mL (the diluted solution) plus 2.5 mL of NaOH, so 42.5 mL total. But when calculating concentrations, we can use the ratio since the volume cancels out in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. \n\nThe pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). \n\nThe pKa is -log(Ka) = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. \n\nKa is 1.85x10^-5. Let me see, log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is -4.733, so pKa is 4.733. \n\nSo, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. The log of 1/3 is about -0.477. \n\nSo pH = 4.733 - 0.477 \u2248 4.256. That's around 4.26. That would correspond to the first value in option A (4.26; 8.52) or D (4.57; 6.92).

So 0.5405e-9 is 5.405e-10, which is correct. \n\nThen, Kb = 5.405e-10. \n\nThen, using x^2 /0.02 = 5.405e-10 \u2192 x^2 = 5.405e-10 *0.02 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x = sqrt(1.081e-11).

          "text1": "Wait, no, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid. Since the acetic acid was diluted, but the moles are still 0.001, right? Because when you dilute, the number of moles doesn't change. So the equivalence point volume of NaOH is (0.001 mol)/(0.1 mol/L) = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL. So the equivalence point is at 10 mL of NaOH added. \n\nNow, the question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. So 25% titration means adding 25% of the equivalence volume. Since equivalence is 10 mL, 25% would be 2.5 mL of NaOH added. \n\nFirst, let's handle the 25% titration point. So at that point, how much acetic acid and its conjugate base (acetate) are present?\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) are 0.001 mol. The NaOH added will react with acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio to form acetate (CH3COO^-) and water. The amount of NaOH added at 25% is 2.5 mL of 0.1 M, so moles of NaOH = 0.0025 L * 0.1 M = 0.00025 mol. \n\nSo, moles of acetic acid remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate formed: 0.00025 mol. \n\nThe total volume at this point is original 40 mL (the diluted solution) plus 2.5 mL of NaOH, so 42.5 mL total. But when calculating concentrations, we can use the ratio since the volume cancels out in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. \n\nThe pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). \n\nThe pKa is -log(Ka) = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. \n\nKa is 1.85x10^-5. Let me see, log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is -4.733, so pKa is 4.733. \n\nSo, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. The log of 1/3 is about -0.477. \n\nSo pH = 4.733 - 0.477 \u2248 4.256. That's around 4.26. That would correspond to the first value in option A (4.26; 8.52) or D (4.57; 6.92). Hmm, so maybe that's the first one. Let me check again.",
          "text2": "Wait, but equivalence point is when the moles of NaOH equal the initial moles of acetic acid. So the calculation is correct here, 10 mL of NaOH needed. \n\nSo the equivalence point is at 10 mL of NaOH added. \n\nNow, the question asks for the pH at 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence point volume is 25% of 10 mL, which is 2.5 mL of NaOH added. \n\nAt 25% titration, so before equivalence, there's a buffer solution of acetic acid and its conjugate base (acetate ion). Let me compute the moles of each.\n\nInitial moles of acetic acid (after dilution) is 0.001 mol. \n\nMoles of NaOH added at 2.5 mL: 0.0025 L * 0.1 M = 0.00025 mol. \n\nSo, the reaction is: \n\nCH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COO^- + H2O\n\nSo, moles of acetic acid remaining = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.\n\nMoles of acetate formed = 0.00025 mol. \n\nThe total volume now is the original 40 mL plus 2.5 mL of NaOH, which is 42.5 mL or 0.0425 L. \n\nThe concentrations would be:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 let me calculate that. 0.00075 divided by 0.0425. Let's see, 0.00075 /0.0425 = 0.017647 M approx.\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M approx.\n\nNow, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nFirst, pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. \n\nlog(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5). log(1.85) is approx 0.267, so total log is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.",
