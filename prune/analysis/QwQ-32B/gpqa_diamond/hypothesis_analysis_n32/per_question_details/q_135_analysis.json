The minimum energy required for the decay is when the decay products are at rest, but since they are a fermion pair, they must have opposite momenta. Hmm, actually, in the rest frame of the X boson, the two fermions must each have energy E = sqrt( (p^2 c^2) + (m_f c^2)^2 ). But since they are a pair, their momenta must be equal and opposite.

Because sometimes in particle physics, even if the total mass is higher than the boson's mass, the decay might still be possible via some off-shell processes, but no, kinematically, the rest mass must be less. Because in the rest frame of the boson, the total energy is just its mass. So the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than the boson's mass. Otherwise, it's impossible. \n\nSo, if the X is 6 GeV, then any decay products that have a combined rest mass exceeding that are forbidden. So for example, bottom quarks are too heavy.

Similarly, up (u) and down (d) quarks are much lighter, like around 2 to 5 MeV, so their combined mass is negligible. So those decays are allowed. \n\nNow, the leptons. The tau lepton has a mass of about 1.777 GeV. So a tau pair would need to have 3.55 GeV total, which is under 6, so allowed. The muon is about 0.106 GeV, so a muon pair is 0.212 GeV.

Since each has mass m_f, the total is 2m_f. So 2m_f \u2264 M_X. Thus, m_f \u2264 M_X/2. Since M_X is 6 GeV, the threshold is 3 GeV.

Since the X boson is 6 GeV, each fermion pair must have a sum of their masses (each pair is a fermion and its antiparticle, so their masses are the same) so each particle's mass must be less than 3 GeV. Because when they are at rest, their total mass would be 2m_f, so 2m_f < 6 GeV \u2192 m_f < 3 GeV. \n\nSo, the question is which of the listed particles have masses less than 3 GeV. Let me list the masses of the fermions:\n\nFirst, for quarks: \n\n- Up quark: around 2.3 MeV (very light)\n- Down quark: ~4.8 MeV (still way below)\n- Strange quark: about 96 MeV\n- Charm quark: ~1.28 GeV\n- Bottom quark: ~4.18 GeV\n- Top quark: ~173 GeV (way too heavy)\n\nFor leptons:\n\n- Electron: ~0.511 MeV\n- Muon: ~105.7 MeV\n- Tau: ~1.777 GeV\n\nNow, the possible decay products are pairs of fermions and antifermions. The problem lists options with various quark pairs and lepton pairs. Let's check each option's entries against the mass conditions.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: X\u2192 b\u0304b, s\u0304s, u\u016b, d\u0304d, \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212, e+e\u2212",

Let me list all the fermions in the options and their masses:\n\nQuarks:\n\nu, d are very light, like ~ few MeV or less. \n\ns quark mass is about 100 MeV (but actual value depends on context; maybe 100-200 MeV). \n\nc quark is about 1.3 GeV. \n\nb quark is about 4.2 GeV. \n\nt quark is 173 GeV (way too big).\n\nLeptons:\n\ne is 0.511 MeV,\n\nmuon is about 105 MeV,\n\ntau is about 1.777 GeV.\n\nSo, let me go through each fermion in the options.\n\nFirst, in option A: \n\nX \u2192 b\u0304b: b quark mass is ~4.2 GeV. So 2*4.2 = 8.4 GeV. But X is only 6 GeV. So that's impossible. So b\u0304b is not allowed. So option A would have that decay, which is not allowed. Therefore A is incorrect.\n\nOption D has b\u0304b as well, so D is also out.\n\nNow looking at option B:\n\nX \u2192 c\u0304c: c mass is ~1.3 GeV. 2*1.3 = 2.6 GeV < 6 GeV, so yes. \n\ns: same as above, s mass ~ 0.1-0.2 GeV, so yes. \n\nu and d are fine.\n\nTau pair: tau's mass is ~1.777 GeV. 2*1.777 = ~3.554 GeV <6, so okay. \n\nmuon pair: ~0.21 GeV (since muon is 105 MeV, so 2*0.105 = 0.21 GeV). So okay. \n\nElectron pair: negligible. \n\nSo all these are okay. So option B lists c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e pairs. \n\nOption C includes t\u0304t, which is 173 GeV each, so 346 GeV total. Way over 6 GeV, so that's impossible. So C is out. \n\nOption D includes b\u0304b, which as before, 8.4>6, so no. \n\nSo between A, B, C, D, the only possible correct answer is B.",
          "text2": "Wait, the key here is that each fermion pair must have a combined rest mass less than or equal to the X boson's mass. Since the X boson is 6 GeV, each fermion pair must have a sum of their masses (each pair is a fermion and its antiparticle, so their masses are the same) so each particle's mass must be less than 3 GeV. Because when they are at rest, their total mass would be 2m_f, so 2m_f < 6 GeV \u2192 m_f < 3 GeV. \n\nSo, the question is which of the listed particles have masses less than 3 GeV.

So option A includes b\u0304b which is impossible. So A is incorrect.\n\nOption B: includes c\u0304c. The charm quark is 1.3 GeV, so 2m_c ~2.6 GeV, which is less than 6. So that's okay. Then the other terms like s\u0304s (which is okay since s is 0.1 GeV) and the leptons. The tau pair would be 2*1.777 ~3.55 GeV, which is under 6. So tau pair is okay. The muon is about 0.1 GeV, so okay. Electron even less. So B includes c\u0304c and others. But let me check other options.\n\nOption C has t\u0304t. The top quark is way too heavy (173 GeV), so 2*173 is way over 6 GeV. So option C is out.\n\nOption D includes b\u0304b again. Same problem as A.

Then the other terms like s\u0304s (which is okay since s is 0.1 GeV) and the leptons. The tau pair would be 2*1.777 ~3.55 GeV, which is under 6. So tau pair is okay. The muon is about 0.1 GeV, so okay. Electron even less. So B includes c\u0304c and others. But let me check other options.\n\nOption C has t\u0304t.

Since each has mass m_f, the total is 2m_f. So 2m_f \u2264 M_X. Thus, m_f \u2264 M_X/2. Since M_X is 6 GeV, the threshold is 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be produced in the decay. \n\nNow the question is, which of these particles have masses below 3 GeV? Let me list the particles in the options and their approximate masses.\n\nLooking at the options, the possible fermions are:\n\n- b quark: ~4.2 GeV (too heavy)\n- s quark: about 0.1 GeV (okay)\n- u and d quarks: even lighter, like 2-5 MeV (way under)\n- c quark: around 1.3 GeV (okay)\n- t quark: ~173 GeV (way too heavy)\n- \u03c4 lepton: ~1.777 GeV (okay)\n- \u03bc lepton: ~0.105 GeV (okay)\n- e lepton: ~0.0005 GeV (fine)\n\nSo the key is, any fermion with mass less than 3 GeV can be part of the decay products. \n\nSo looking at the options:\n\nOption A lists: b\u0304b, s\u0304s, u\u016b, d\u0304d, \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212, e+e\u2212. The problem here is the bottom quark (b) has a mass around 4.2 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So the b quark pair's total mass would be 8.4 GeV, which is way over the X's mass of 6 GeV. Thus, X can't decay into b quarks. So option A is incorrect because it includes b\u0304b.\n\nOption B: c\u0304c, s\u0304s, u\u016b, d\u0304d, \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212, \u03bc+\u03bc\u2212, e+e\u2212. The charm quark (c) is about 1.3 GeV, so 2*1.3 = 2.6 GeV, which is under 6 GeV. \u03c4 is ~1.777, so 2*1.777 ~3.55 GeV, which is still under 6. So \u03c4 is okay. The others are fine. So option B includes all these, which are allowed. \n\nOption C: includes top quarks t\u0304t. Top quarks are way too heavy (173 GeV), so that's impossible. So C is out.\n\nOption D: includes b\u0304b again, which is too heavy, so D is also out.\n\nNow between A, B, D, C. So the correct answer must be B?",
          "text2": "Wait, the key here is that each fermion pair must have a combined rest mass less than or equal to the X boson's mass.
