The mechanism might involve the nitro group making the alpha hydrogen acidic, so KOH could deprotonate it to form an enolate. The enolate could then attack the enenitrile (but-2-enenitrile) in a Michael addition. \n\nLet me think step by step. The 1-nitropropane has a nitro group on the first carbon. The alpha hydrogens are on the second carbon (since nitro is on C1, so the alpha is C2). The nitro group is electron-withdrawing, making the alpha proton more acidic. The KOH would deprotonate the alpha carbon (C2), forming an enolate. The enolate (on C2 of the nitropropane) then attacks the Michael acceptor, which could be the but-2-enenitrile. \n\nThe but-2-enenitrile (E) has the double bond between C2 and C3 (since it's but-2-enenitrile; butane numbering: 1 is CH2, 2 is CH-CH, 3 is CH2, 4 is CN). The E configuration would have the groups on each side. The nitropropane's enolate would attack the beta carbon of the enenitrile. \n\nThe enenitrile's structure is CH2-CH2-CH-C\u2261N?",
