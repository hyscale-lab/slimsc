That suggests that there are two different environments for that proton, but in equal amounts. Since the LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass, but different in some way. Since mass spectra are the same, it's not different molecular weights, so maybe different isomers?\n\nLooking at the options: option D is diastereoisomers.
