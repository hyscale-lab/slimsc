Let's count the bonds:\n\nEach molecule has 12 C atoms and 22 H atoms.\n\nEach C atom forms bonds with other atoms. Each C atom can bond to up to four other atoms (valence 4).\n\nFirst, let's count the total number of bonds in the molecule.\n\nThe total number of bonds in a molecule can be calculated as:\n\nTotal bonds = (\u03a3 valence of all atoms)/2 - (number of negative charges)/2 + (number of positive charges)/2 \n\nBut since we're dealing with a hydrocarbon (no charges), it's just (\u03a3 valence)/2.\n\nEach C has 4 bonds, each H has 1 bond.\n\nTotal valence:\n\nC:12\u00d74 =48,\n\nH:22\u00d71 =22,\n\nTotal valence =48+22=70.\n\nTotal bonds =70/2 =35.\n\nSo the molecule has 35 bonds. \n\nNow, we need to find how many are C-C, C=C, and C-H.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of C-H bonds. Each H is bonded to a C, so there are 22 C-H bonds.\n\nThus, the remaining bonds are between C-C or C=C.\n\nTotal non-H bonds: 35 total -22 C-H =13 (C-C or C=C bonds).\n\nNow, the number of double bonds (C=C) can be found by considering the degrees of unsaturation.",

To form the molecule from elements, you need to:\n\n   a. Atomize the carbon: each mole of C (graphite) becomes gaseous C atoms, requiring 1000 kJ/mol.\n\n   b.

Each C atom can bond to up to four other atoms (valence 4).\n\nFirst, let's count the total number of bonds in the molecule.\n\nThe total number of bonds in a molecule can be calculated as:\n\nTotal bonds = (\u03a3 valence of all atoms)/2 - (number of negative charges)/2 + (number of positive charges)/2 \n\nBut since we're dealing with a hydrocarbon (no charges), it's just (\u03a3 valence)/2.\n\nEach C has 4 bonds, each H has 1 bond.\n\nTotal valence:\n\nC:12\u00d74 =48,\n\nH:22\u00d71 =22,\n\nTotal valence =48+22=70.\n\nTotal bonds =70/2 =35.\n\nSo the molecule has 35 bonds. \n\nNow, we need to find how many are C-C, C=C, and C-H.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of C-H bonds. Each H is bonded to a C, so there are 22 C-H bonds.\n\nThus, the remaining bonds are between C-C or C=C.\n\nTotal non-H bonds: 35 total -22 C-H =13 (C-C or C=C bonds).\n\nNow, the number of double bonds (C=C) can be found by considering the degrees of unsaturation.",

Let me recount the C-C bonds properly. \n\nFirst, the main chain:\n\nCarbons 1-2 (double bond, so not counted as a single bond),\n\n1 has two branches (two CH3 groups attached via single bonds). \n\nSo each CH3 attached to C1 adds a C-C single bond (between C1 and the CH3's carbon). So that's two C-C bonds here. \n\nC2 connected to C3 (single bond),\n\nC3 connected to C4 (single),\n\nC4 connected to C5 (single),\n\nC5 connected to C6 (single),\n\nC6 connected to C7 (double bond: not a single bond),\n\nC7 has two CH3 groups attached via single bonds (so two C-C bonds here).\n\nAdditionally, C4 has a CH3 group: so between C4 and that CH3's carbon is another single bond. \n\nSo total C-C single bonds in branches:\n\nC1's two CH3: 2 bonds,\n\nC4's CH3: 1 bond,\n\nC7's two CH3: 2 bonds,\n\nTotal branches: 2+1+2=5.\n\nMain chain single bonds between carbons (excluding double bonds):\n\nBetween C2 and C3,\n\nC3-C4,\n\nC4-C5,\n\nC5-C6: four bonds.\n\nSo total C-C single bonds: 5+4=9. That's correct. \n\nC=C double bonds: 2 (C1-C2 and C6-C7). \n\nC-H bonds: 22. \n\nSo bond energy in molecule: \n\nC-C single (9\u00d7200)=1800,\n\nC=C (2\u00d7300)=600,\n\nC-H (22\u00d7400)=8800,\n\nTotal 11200. \n\nThe energy to break elements:\n\n7 carbons \u00d71000 =7000,\n\nHydrogen atoms:22, so 11 moles of H2 \u2192 11\u00d7100=1100,\n\nTotal 8100. \n\nThus, \u0394Hf = 8100 - 11200 = -3100 kJ/mol. \n\nBut that's a negative value, and the options don't have this. So clearly, I made a mistake in the approach.",

To form the molecule, we need to break the H-H bonds. Each H atom comes from H2, so for each H atom in the molecule, we need to break \u00bd of an H-H bond (since each bond is shared between two atoms).

So for each mole of C atoms needed, that's 1000 kJ.\n\nFor H2 gas: each mole of H2 requires breaking into H atoms, which requires energy equal to the bond energy.

For carbon, the standard state is graphite (so C(s)), but here the problem gives enthalpy of atomization of carbon, which is the energy required to break all bonds in a mole of the element into gaseous atoms.

The bonds broken would be the bonds in the reactants. For carbon, to form the molecule, we need to atomize the carbon (break all bonds in graphite to get individual carbon atoms?), but the problem gives the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. So maybe that's the energy required to break the carbon into individual atoms. So each mole of carbon requires 1000 kJ to atomize.\n\nHydrogen in H2 has bonds that need to be broken.

          "text1": "Wait, let me rephrase.\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is calculated as:\n\n\u0394Hf = (Total energy to break all bonds in reactants) - (Total energy released when forming bonds in products)\n\nThe reactants are the elements: carbon as graphite and hydrogen as H2 gas.\n\nBreaking the bonds in the reactants:\n\n- For each C atom, we need to atomize it from solid graphite to gaseous C atoms. The given atomization energy is 1000 kJ/mol per mole of C. So for 12 C atoms, that's 12 \u00d7 1000 kJ/mol (per mole of the compound).\n\n- For H atoms: each H2 molecule has a bond energy of 100 kJ/mol. To get H atoms, you need to break H2 into H atoms. Each mole of H2 requires 100 kJ to break into 2 moles of H atoms. So per H atom, the energy is 50 kJ/mol.\n\nThe total energy for H atoms is (22 atoms \u00d750 kJ/mol per H atom) per mole of compound.\n\nThus, total energy to break bonds in reactants (elements) is:\n\n12 \u00d7 1000 + 22 \u00d750 = 12000 + 1100 = 13100 kJ/mol.\n\nNow, the bonds formed in the product (the molecule):\n\nWe need to sum all bond energies in the molecule.\n\nLet's count the bonds:\n\nFirst, the types of bonds:\n\n- C-C single bonds\n\n- C=C double bonds\n\n- C-H bonds.\n\nWe need to count how many of each.\n\nNumber of C-C single bonds:\n\nTotal carbons:12. The bonds between carbons include some single and double bonds.\n\nThe molecule has two double bonds (C=C), so those are two double bonds. Each double bond is one bond (but with higher energy).",

The enthalpy of formation of a compound from its elements in their standard states is calculated as:\n\n\u0394Hf\u00b0 = [sum of bond energies of bonds broken (in reactants)] - [sum of bond energies of bonds formed (in products)]\n\nThe reactants here are the elements: carbon (as graphite) and hydrogen (as H2 gas). The bonds broken would be the bonds in the reactants. For carbon, to form the molecule, we need to atomize the carbon (break all bonds in graphite to get individual carbon atoms?), but the problem gives the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. So maybe that's the energy required to break the carbon into individual atoms. So each mole of carbon requires 1000 kJ to atomize.\n\nHydrogen in H2 has bonds that need to be broken. Each H2 molecule has a bond with energy 100 kJ/mol, so for each mole of H2, it takes 100 kJ to break them into H atoms.\n\nThe product is the molecule given. The bonds formed in the product would be all the C-C, C=C, C-H bonds in the molecule. So for each bond in the molecule, we subtract the energy (since forming bonds releases energy, so it's subtracted from the total required).\n\nSo putting this all together:\n\n\u0394Hf\u00b0 = [ (number of C atoms \u00d7 atomization energy of C) + (number of H atoms / 2 \u00d7 H-H bond energy) ] - [sum of all bond energies in the molecule ]",
