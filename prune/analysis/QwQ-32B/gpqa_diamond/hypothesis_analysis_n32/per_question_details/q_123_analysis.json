Therefore, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1/0.98 \u2248 1.02062.",

So the time in the galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t0. \n\nGamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). \n\nCalculating v/c: 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2. \n\nThus, (v/c)^2 = 0.04, so 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. \n\nsqrt(0.96) \u2248 0.9798. \n\nSo gamma \u2248 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206. \n\nTherefore, t = 1.0206 * 50 \u2248 51.03 seconds. \n\nThen the distance in the galaxy frame is v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s. \n\nCalculating that: 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000.

Let's write both numbers as multiples:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 8:\n\n60000 \u00f78 =7500\n\n299792 \u00f78 =37474\n\nSo 7500 /37474. Let me compute this division with more precision. \n\n37474 \u00d70.2 =7494.8, which is very close to 7500. The difference between 7500 and 7494.8 is 5.2. \n\nSo 7500/37474 =0.2 + (5.2)/37474. \n\n5.2 /37474 \u22480.00013877. \n\nThus beta \u22480.2 +0.00013877 \u22480.20013877. \n\nSo beta squared is (0.20013877)^2.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n0.2^2 =0.04\n\n2*(0.2)*(0.00013877)=0.000055508\n\n(0.00013877)^2 \u22480.000000019\n\nTotal beta squared is 0.04 +0.000055508 +0.000000019\u22480.040055527.\n\nThus, 1 - beta squared = 0.959944473.\n\nsqrt(0.959944473).

The formula is that the time in the Galaxy frame would be t = gamma * t0, where t0 is the proper time (50 seconds here), and gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nSo first, let me compute gamma.

So my original calculation holds.\n\nTherefore, the time in the galaxy's frame is \u0394t = \u03b3 * \u0394t', where \u0394t' is 50 seconds. Then the distance is v * \u0394t = 6e4 km/s * 1.0206*50 s \u2248 6e4 *51.03 \u2248 3,061,800 km. The closest option is D) 3,060,000 km. The slight difference is probably due to rounding gamma. Let me check with more precise gamma.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.96) precisely. Let me compute sqrt(0.96):\n\nLet me note that sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(24/25) = (sqrt(24))/5. sqrt(24) is about 4.898979. So 4.898979/5 = 0.9797959. So 1 divided by that is 1/0.9797959 \u22481.020620726.\n\nSo gamma is exactly 1.020620726.\n\nSo 1.020620726 *50 = 51.0310363 seconds. Then 60,000 *51.0310363 = 60,000 *51 = 3,060,000 and 60,000 *0.0310363 \u2248 1,862.18 km. Adding to 3,060,000 gives 3,061,862.18 km. \n\nThe closest option is D, which is 3,060,000.",

So if the galaxy's frame S sees the ejecta moving at v, then the ejecta's frame S' sees the galaxy moving at v in the opposite direction. So the speed is the same. So 60,000 km/s is the speed in both frames, just opposite directions. So that part is okay.\n\nTherefore, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 6e4 km/s towards the center. The question is, over what distance does the ejecta travel in the galaxy's frame during the time that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame?\n\nSo in other words, in the ejecta's frame, the proper time \u0394t' is 50 seconds. But in the galaxy's frame, the time elapsed would be longer due to time dilation. So the distance would be v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame.\n\nThe time dilation formula is \u0394t = \u03b3 \u0394t', where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor (1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)). So first, compute gamma.\n\nSo let's compute v in m/s. 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s = 6e7 m/s. c is 3e8 m/s.\n\nv/c = 6e7 / 3e8 = 0.2. So v = 0.2c.\n\nSo gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2\u00b2) = 1 / sqrt(1 -0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96). Let's compute sqrt(0.96). sqrt(0.96) is approximately sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(96)/10 \u2248 9.798/10 \u2248 0.9798. So 1/0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.

Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 6e4 km/s * 50 s = 3e6 km.

Let me compute this step by step:\n\n51.031035 * 6e4 = (51 *6e4) + (0.031035 *6e4)\n\n51 *6e4 = 3,060,000.\n\n0.031035 *60,000 = 1,862.1.\n\nTotal is 3,060,000 + 1,862.1 = 3,061,862.1 km.\n\nHmm, so that's about 3,061,862 km.

Therefore, the time in the Galaxy's frame would be longer, so \u0394t = \u03b3 * 50.\n\nBut to compute the distance in the Galaxy's frame, we need to calculate the distance as speed multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame. Because in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s, so distance would be v * \u0394t.\n\nFirst, let's compute gamma. Let's compute gamma using the velocity.

Let's compute v/c:\n\nv/c = 6e7 / 3e8 = 0.2. \n\nSo (v/c)^2 = 0.04. \n\nThus, 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. \n\nsqrt(0.96) is approximately sqrt(0.9624) would be 0.98, but let's compute sqrt(0.96):\n\nsqrt(0.96) = sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(24/25 * 4) no wait, sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(24/25 * 4?)",

So if the galaxy's frame S sees the ejecta moving at v, then the ejecta's frame S' sees the galaxy moving at v in the opposite direction. So the speed is the same. So 60,000 km/s is the speed in both frames, just opposite directions. So that part is okay.\n\nTherefore, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 6e4 km/s towards the center. The question is, over what distance does the ejecta travel in the galaxy's frame during the time that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame?\n\nSo in other words, in the ejecta's frame, the proper time \u0394t' is 50 seconds. But in the galaxy's frame, the time elapsed would be longer due to time dilation. So the distance would be v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame.\n\nThe time dilation formula is \u0394t = \u03b3 \u0394t', where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor (1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)).

So sqrt(24/25)= (sqrt(24))/5 \u2248 (4.89898)/5 \u2248 0.9798. So gamma is 1/0.9798 \u2248 1.020620726. Let's use that value for gamma. \n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.020620726. Multiply by 50:\n\n50 * 1.020620726 = 51.0310363 seconds. \n\nThen distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.0310363 s = \n\n60,000 * 51.0310363 = \n\nLet me compute 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000.\n\nThen 60,000 * 1.0310363 = 60,000 *1 =60,000, plus 60,000*0.0310363 \u2248 60,000*0.03 =1,800, so total 61,800, plus 60,000*(0.0010363) \u2248 62.18. So total for the extra 1.031 seconds would be approx 61,800 +62.18 \u2248 61,862.18. \n\nAdding to 3,000,000 gives 3,061,862. So approximately 3,061,862 km. The closest option is D) 3,060,000 km.

Let me compute the gamma factor first. \n\nGamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)). \n\nCalculating v/c: 6e7 / 3e8 = 0.2. So (v/c) is 0.2, so (v/c)^2 is 0.04. Then 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. sqrt(0.96) is approximately sqrt(0.96) \u2248 0.9798. Therefore gamma \u2248 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.",

So in S', the speed of the center is u' = +60,000 km/s. \n\nThe velocity addition formula states that the velocity of an object in S' (the ejecta's frame) is given by:\n\nu' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c\u00b2 )\n\nHere, the object is the center of the galaxy. In S (the galaxy's frame), the center is stationary, so u = 0. Therefore:\n\nu' = (-v) / (1 - 0) = -v",

So if the galaxy's frame S sees the ejecta moving at v, then the ejecta's frame S' sees the galaxy moving at v in the opposite direction. So the speed is the same. So 60,000 km/s is the speed in both frames, just opposite directions. So that part is okay.\n\nTherefore, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 6e4 km/s towards the center. The question is, over what distance does the ejecta travel in the galaxy's frame during the time that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame?\n\nSo in other words, in the ejecta's frame, the proper time \u0394t' is 50 seconds. But in the galaxy's frame, the time elapsed would be longer due to time dilation. So the distance would be v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame.\n\nThe time dilation formula is \u0394t = \u03b3 \u0394t', where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor (1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)). So first, compute gamma.\n\nSo let's compute v in m/s. 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s = 6e7 m/s. c is 3e8 m/s.\n\nv/c = 6e7 / 3e8 = 0.2. So v = 0.2c.\n\nSo gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2\u00b2) = 1 / sqrt(1 -0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96). Let's compute sqrt(0.96). sqrt(0.96) is approximately sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(96)/10 \u2248 9.798/10 \u2248 0.9798. So 1/0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.

Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 6e4 km/s * 50 s = 3e6 km.
