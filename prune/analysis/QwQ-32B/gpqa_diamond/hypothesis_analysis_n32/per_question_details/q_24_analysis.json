X is equimolar mixture of two liquids (alkenes, since they decolorize bromine) with no conjugated multiple bonds.\n\n2. When treated with Pt and heated, they disproportionate to form Y (two other liquids which don't decolorize bromine, so saturated).\n\n3. Hydrogenation of X and Y (under severe conditions) gives Z, a hydrocarbon which is part of Y and is a solvent.\n\n4. Z has a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%, which is about 1/7 (since 14.28 is roughly 1/7, 1/7 is ~14.286%). Let me check: Hydrogen mass fraction is (mass of H)/(mass of compound) = 14.28%.\n\nSo let's calculate the possible formula of Z.

          "text2": "Wait, another thought: maybe the alkenes are undergoing isomerization or some other rearrangement, but the key here is that the products in Y don't decolorize bromine. That suggests that the products are saturated (like alkanes) or maybe other compounds without double bonds. Since the problem mentions that Y is a mixture of two other liquids, maybe the alkenes are undergoing some kind of disproportionation reaction where one becomes more substituted and another less? Not sure yet.\n\nThen, when both mixtures X and Y are hydrogenated under severe conditions with platinum, they give the same hydrocarbon Z. Hydrogenation would typically reduce any double or triple bonds to single bonds. Since Z is a constituent of Y and doesn't react further with H2, that means Z must be a saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) with no double bonds. The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let's calculate the molecular formula of Z first because that might help.\n\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, so the rest is carbon. Let me see. Let\u2019s let the molar mass of Z be M. Let\u2019s denote the number of H atoms as H and C as C. The mass fraction of H is (H / M) * 100% = 14.28%. Therefore, H / M = 0.1428, so C/(M) = 0.8572. Since M = 12*C + H (since each carbon is 12, each H is 1), substituting:\n\nH/(12C + H) = 0.1428\n\nLet me rearrange this equation. Let me suppose that Z is an alkane, so the formula is CnH2n+2. Let's denote n as the number of carbons. Then, H = 2n + 2. The molar mass M is 12n + (2n +2) = 14n + 2. \n\nThen, the mass fraction of H is (2n+2)/(14n +2) = 0.1428. Let me solve for n:\n\n(2n + 2)/(14n +2) = 0.1428\n\nMultiply both sides by (14n +2):\n\n2n + 2 = 0.1428*(14n +2)\n\nCalculate the right side:\n\n0.1428*14n = 2n (since 14*0.1428 is approximately 2?)",

So the alkenes in X are two different hexenes (cis or trans?), but since they are equimolar, perhaps two different structural isomers.",

Let me see possible hydrocarbons.\n\nLet me try to find the formula of Z. Let's suppose it's a saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) since after hydrogenation, it's not reacting further. Let me think: suppose Z is an alkane. Let me suppose the formula is C6H14 (hexane). Let me check the hydrogen mass fraction. The molar mass of C6H14 is (6*12) +14 = 86. The mass of hydrogen is 14, so 14/86 \u2248 0.1628, which is about 16.28%, which is higher than given. The question says 14.28%. Hmm. Let's try another.\n\nHow about C8H18 (octane)? Mass of H is 18, total mass 12*8 +18= 126. 18/126=0.1428 or 14.28%. Exactly! So Z must be octane, C8H18. So that's a key point. Since hydrogenation of X and Y both give octane, which is a component of Y, then Y must consist of octane and another compound. \n\nNow, since Y is formed from X via disproportionation, let's think about what reactions can lead to octane and another product.

X is equimolar mixture of two liquids (alkenes, since they decolorize bromine) with no conjugated multiple bonds.\n\n2. When treated with Pt and heated, they disproportionate to form Y (two other liquids which don't decolorize bromine, so saturated).\n\n3. Hydrogenation of X and Y (under severe conditions) gives Z, a hydrocarbon which is part of Y and is a solvent.\n\n4. Z has a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%, which is about 1/7 (since 14.28 is roughly 1/7, 1/7 is ~14.286%). Let me check: Hydrogen mass fraction is (mass of H)/(mass of compound) = 14.28%.\n\nSo let's calculate the possible formula of Z. Let's denote the formula as CxHy.\n\nThe mass fraction of H is (Hy / (12x + Hy)) = 14.28% = 0.1428.\n\nLet me set up the equation:\n\nHy / (12x + Hy) = 0.1428\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\nHy = 0.1428*(12x + Hy)\n\nHy = 0.1428*12x + 0.1428*Hy\n\nHy - 0.1428 Hy = 0.1428*12x\n\nHy*(1 - 0.1428) = 1.7136x\n\nHy*(0.8572) = 1.7136x\n\nHy = (1.7136 / 0.8572) x\n\nCalculating 1.7136 / 0.8572 \u2248 2.

          "text2": "Wait, another thought: maybe the alkenes are undergoing isomerization or some other rearrangement, but the key here is that the products in Y don't decolorize bromine. That suggests that the products are saturated (like alkanes) or maybe other compounds without double bonds. Since the problem mentions that Y is a mixture of two other liquids, maybe the alkenes are undergoing some kind of disproportionation reaction where one becomes more substituted and another less? Not sure yet.\n\nThen, when both mixtures X and Y are hydrogenated under severe conditions with platinum, they give the same hydrocarbon Z. Hydrogenation would typically reduce any double or triple bonds to single bonds. Since Z is a constituent of Y and doesn't react further with H2, that means Z must be a saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) with no double bonds. The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let's calculate the molecular formula of Z first because that might help.\n\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, so the rest is carbon. Let me see. Let\u2019s let the molar mass of Z be M. Let\u2019s denote the number of H atoms as H and C as C. The mass fraction of H is (H / M) * 100% = 14.28%. Therefore, H / M = 0.1428, so C/(M) = 0.8572. Since M = 12*C + H (since each carbon is 12, each H is 1), substituting:\n\nH/(12C + H) = 0.1428\n\nLet me rearrange this equation. Let me suppose that Z is an alkane, so the formula is CnH2n+2. Let's denote n as the number of carbons. Then, H = 2n + 2. The molar mass M is 12n + (2n +2) = 14n + 2. \n\nThen, the mass fraction of H is (2n+2)/(14n +2) = 0.1428. Let me solve for n:\n\n(2n + 2)/(14n +2) = 0.1428\n\nMultiply both sides by (14n +2):\n\n2n + 2 = 0.1428*(14n +2)\n\nCalculate the right side:\n\n0.1428*14n = 2n (since 14*0.1428 is approximately 2?)",

Because cycloalkanes have the formula CnH2n. So m=2n. Exactly! So for a cycloalkane: CnH2n. Then the formula would fit the equation m=2n. \n\nAh, so Z must be a cycloalkane. Because in that case, H atoms are 2n. So substituting into the mass fraction equation:\n\nm/(12n +m) = (2n)/(12n +2n)=2n/14n=1/7\u224814.28%. Perfect, that works. Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane. \n\nSo Z is a cycloalkane with formula CnH2n. \n\nNow, the problem states that Z is a constituent of mixture Y, which is formed by the disproportionation of X. \n\nLet me think: since mixture X when treated with platinum and heated gives Y (disproportionation), which when hydrogenated gives Z. Also, mixture X's components are liquids that decolorize bromine water, so they have double bonds or triple bonds. Also, no conjugated multiple bonds in X's molecules.",

When they are heated with platinum, maybe the cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane (losing the double bond), and the 1-hexene becomes hexane (C6H14).

Maybe I should consider the total hydrogens in mixture X's components. \n\nIf Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then X's components, when hydrogenated, must each become cyclohexane.

The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, so the ratio of H to the total mass is 14.28%. Let me denote the formula as CnHm. The hydrogen mass is (m * 1)/(12n + m) = 0.1428. Let me compute possible formulas.",
          "text2": "Wait, another thought: maybe the alkenes are undergoing isomerization or some other rearrangement, but the key here is that the products in Y don't decolorize bromine. That suggests that the products are saturated (like alkanes) or maybe other compounds without double bonds. Since the problem mentions that Y is a mixture of two other liquids, maybe the alkenes are undergoing some kind of disproportionation reaction where one becomes more substituted and another less? Not sure yet.\n\nThen, when both mixtures X and Y are hydrogenated under severe conditions with platinum, they give the same hydrocarbon Z. Hydrogenation would typically reduce any double or triple bonds to single bonds. Since Z is a constituent of Y and doesn't react further with H2, that means Z must be a saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) with no double bonds. The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let's calculate the molecular formula of Z first because that might help.\n\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, so the rest is carbon. Let me see. Let\u2019s let the molar mass of Z be M. Let\u2019s denote the number of H atoms as H and C as C. The mass fraction of H is (H / M) * 100% = 14.28%. Therefore, H / M = 0.1428, so C/(M) = 0.8572. Since M = 12*C + H (since each carbon is 12, each H is 1), substituting:\n\nH/(12C + H) = 0.1428\n\nLet me rearrange this equation. Let me suppose that Z is an alkane, so the formula is CnH2n+2. Let's denote n as the number of carbons. Then, H = 2n + 2. The molar mass M is 12n + (2n +2) = 14n + 2. \n\nThen, the mass fraction of H is (2n+2)/(14n +2) = 0.1428. Let me solve for n:\n\n(2n + 2)/(14n +2) = 0.1428\n\nMultiply both sides by (14n +2):\n\n2n + 2 = 0.1428*(14n +2)\n\nCalculate the right side:\n\n0.1428*14n = 2n (since 14*0.1428 is approximately 2?)",

Let me recheck the problem: \"mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation, which does not decolorize bromine water\".

So the other component must be a different saturated hydrocarbon that, when hydrogenated (which does nothing to it, since it's already saturated), remains, but the problem says hydrogenation gives only Z.

Disproportionation reactions can sometimes produce different products. \n\nAlso, when both X and Y are hydrogenated under severe conditions, they both give the same hydrocarbon Z.

The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, so the ratio of H to the total mass is 14.28%. Let me denote the formula as CnHm. The hydrogen mass is (m * 1)/(12n + m) = 0.1428.

Not sure yet.\n\nThen, when both mixtures X and Y are hydrogenated under severe conditions with platinum, they give the same hydrocarbon Z. Hydrogenation would typically reduce any double or triple bonds to single bonds.

Let's calculate the molecular formula of Z first because that might help.\n\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, so the rest is carbon. Let me see. Let\u2019s let the molar mass of Z be M. Let\u2019s denote the number of H atoms as H and C as C. The mass fraction of H is (H / M) * 100% = 14.28%. Therefore, H / M = 0.1428, so C/(M) = 0.8572.
