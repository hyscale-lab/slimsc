Suppose each of the three ketone groups is on alternate carbons of the cyclohexane ring. Each of these carbonyl groups would have adjacent CH2 groups. So for example, the carbon with the ketone (say position 1) is connected to position 2 (a CH2 group) and position 6 (another CH2 group, perhaps). In that case, those adjacent CH2 groups do have hydrogens. So maybe the enol form can form here. For example, the hydrogen on the adjacent carbon can move to form a double bond with the carbonyl carbon, turning it into an enol structure.

The structure would be:\n\nThe parent is propanoic acid, which has a -COOH group. The 2-hydroxy group is on the second carbon. The esterification would replace the -COOH with -OCH3. So the structure would be:\n\nCH3-CH(OH)-CO-OCH3. The second carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) is the central carbon here. Let's see the substituents on that carbon. The carbon at position 2 (the hydroxyl-bearing carbon) is attached to:\n\n- The hydroxyl group (-OH)\n- The adjacent methyl group (from CH3-CH-...)\n- The carbonyl carbon (since it's connected to the CO-OCH3 group)\n- The other carbon (from the rest of the chain).",

If a carbonyl (like in benzoquinone) becomes an enol, then that would involve a hydrogen moving from a neighboring carbon to the oxygen. Let's say in benzoquinone's case, maybe the hydrogens on the benzene ring adjacent to the carbonyl can't form an enol because the aromatic system is lost. Because moving the hydrogen would create a double bond that disrupts the aromaticity. Since benzene rings are stabilized by aromaticity, the system would prefer to stay in the aromatic form, so the keto form is more stable, and the enol form (if any) can't exist because it would break aromaticity. Therefore, benzoquinone doesn't undergo keto-enol tautomerism. \n\nIn contrast, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which is a triketone, might have the possibility. Since it's not an aromatic ring, the carbonyls are on a cyclohexane ring (which is non-aromatic). So the carbonyls can participate in tautomerism. For example, each of the carbonyl groups can form enol tautomers. Since the ring isn't aromatic, the enol form would be possible. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism, so the compound that does NOT show tautomerism (A) would be benzoquinone. So part A's answer is benzoquinone. So looking at the options, for A, the options where A is benzoquinone are options B and D. \n\nNow moving to part B: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism. Optical isomerism arises when a molecule has a chiral center, i.e., a carbon atom with four different substituents. \n\nFirst, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break down the name.

In that case, there's no alpha hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl because the carbonyl is part of the aromatic ring. The adjacent carbons are part of the benzene ring, which are already double-bonded. Therefore, the carbonyl can't form an enol because there's no alpha hydrogen to move. So benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism. \n\nOn the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups. Let me think of the structure again. Suppose each of the three ketone groups is on alternate carbons of the cyclohexane ring. Each of these carbonyl groups would have adjacent CH2 groups. So for example, the carbon with the ketone (say position 1) is connected to position 2 (a CH2 group) and position 6 (another CH2 group, perhaps). In that case, those adjacent CH2 groups do have hydrogens. So maybe the enol form can form here. For example, the hydrogen on the adjacent carbon can move to form a double bond with the carbonyl carbon, turning it into an enol structure. Since there are three carbonyl groups, maybe each can tautomerize. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would show tautomerism. Thus, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is benzoquinone, so A would be benzoquinone. Looking at the options, that would point to option B or D, because in option A, A is the trione, but if the answer is that A is benzoquinone, then the options with A = benzoquinone are B and D.\n\nNow part B: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism. \n\nOptical isomerism (chirality) occurs when there's a chiral center, which is a carbon with four different substituents. Let's analyze each compound. \n\nFirst, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The name suggests it's the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid) with methanol. The structure would be:\n\nThe parent is propanoic acid, which has a -COOH group. The 2-hydroxy group is on the second carbon. The esterification would replace the -COOH with -OCH3. So the structure would be:\n\nCH3-CH(OH)-CO-OCH3. The second carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) is the central carbon here. Let's see the substituents on that carbon. The carbon at position 2 (the hydroxyl-bearing carbon) is attached to:\n\n- The hydroxyl group (-OH)\n- The adjacent methyl group (from CH3-CH-...)\n- The carbonyl carbon (since it's connected to the CO-OCH3 group)\n- The other carbon (from the rest of the chain).",
          "text2": "Wait, but in enol form of a ketone, you might have a conjugated double bond. Let me think. If a carbonyl (like in benzoquinone) becomes an enol, then that would involve a hydrogen moving from a neighboring carbon to the oxygen. Let's say in benzoquinone's case, maybe the hydrogens on the benzene ring adjacent to the carbonyl can't form an enol because the aromatic system is lost. Because moving the hydrogen would create a double bond that disrupts the aromaticity. Since benzene rings are stabilized by aromaticity, the system would prefer to stay in the aromatic form, so the keto form is more stable, and the enol form (if any) can't exist because it would break aromaticity. Therefore, benzoquinone doesn't undergo keto-enol tautomerism. \n\nIn contrast, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which is a triketone, might have the possibility. Since it's not an aromatic ring, the carbonyls are on a cyclohexane ring (which is non-aromatic). So the carbonyls can participate in tautomerism. For example, each of the carbonyl groups can form enol tautomers. Since the ring isn't aromatic, the enol form would be possible. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism, so the compound that does NOT show tautomerism (A) would be benzoquinone. So part A's answer is benzoquinone. So looking at the options, for A, the options where A is benzoquinone are options B and D. \n\nNow moving to part B: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism. Optical isomerism arises when a molecule has a chiral center, i.e., a carbon atom with four different substituents. \n\nFirst, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break down the name.

          "text2": "Wait, the benzene ring in benzoquinone is still aromatic? Let me confirm. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups attached to the benzene ring. Each ketone is an R-CO- group. The oxygen is double-bonded to the carbon. So the benzene ring with two carbonyl groups would have two oxygen atoms each with a double bond to the ring. The aromaticity is maintained because each carbonyl group is a substituent. However, if it were to tautomerize, moving a proton to form an enol, perhaps that would disrupt the aromaticity? For example, if one of the carbonyl groups becomes an enol (like -CH-O-), that might break the conjugation. So maybe benzoquinone doesn't tautomerize because it would lose aromaticity. \n\nOn the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups on the cyclohexane ring. Since it's a saturated ring (cyclohexane), perhaps the enol form is possible.",

So benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism. \n\nOn the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups. Let me think of the structure again. Suppose each of the three ketone groups is on alternate carbons of the cyclohexane ring. Each of these carbonyl groups would have adjacent CH2 groups. So for example, the carbon with the ketone (say position 1) is connected to position 2 (a CH2 group) and position 6 (another CH2 group, perhaps). In that case, those adjacent CH2 groups do have hydrogens. So maybe the enol form can form here. For example, the hydrogen on the adjacent carbon can move to form a double bond with the carbonyl carbon, turning it into an enol structure.

The structure would be:\n\nThe parent is propanoic acid, which has a -COOH group. The 2-hydroxy group is on the second carbon. The esterification would replace the -COOH with -OCH3. So the structure would be:\n\nCH3-CH(OH)-CO-OCH3. The second carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) is the central carbon here. Let's see the substituents on that carbon. The carbon at position 2 (the hydroxyl-bearing carbon) is attached to:\n\n- The hydroxyl group (-OH)\n- The adjacent methyl group (from CH3-CH-...)\n- The carbonyl carbon (since it's connected to the CO-OCH3 group)\n- The other carbon (from the rest of the chain).",

Let's say in benzoquinone's case, maybe the hydrogens on the benzene ring adjacent to the carbonyl can't form an enol because the aromatic system is lost. Because moving the hydrogen would create a double bond that disrupts the aromaticity. Since benzene rings are stabilized by aromaticity, the system would prefer to stay in the aromatic form, so the keto form is more stable, and the enol form (if any) can't exist because it would break aromaticity. Therefore, benzoquinone doesn't undergo keto-enol tautomerism. \n\nIn contrast, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which is a triketone, might have the possibility. Since it's not an aromatic ring, the carbonyls are on a cyclohexane ring (which is non-aromatic). So the carbonyls can participate in tautomerism.

Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism, so the compound that does NOT show tautomerism (A) would be benzoquinone. So part A's answer is benzoquinone.

Because moving the hydrogen would create a double bond that disrupts the aromaticity. Since benzene rings are stabilized by aromaticity, the system would prefer to stay in the aromatic form, so the keto form is more stable, and the enol form (if any) can't exist because it would break aromaticity.

Let me think: the carbon with the ketone (like position 1) is connected to two other ring carbons (positions 6 and 2). Since it's a benzene ring, those positions are all in the ring. The carbon in position 1 has a double bond to oxygen, so it can't have an alpha hydrogen. Because in the ketone, the carbon is double-bonded to O, so the only bonds are: O=C-R1-R2. The two R groups would be the adjacent ring carbons. Therefore, there are no hydrogens on that carbon, so no alpha hydrogen to form an enol.
