But the key point here is that the equilibrium temperature depends on the inverse square root of the semi-major axis, right? Because the energy received decreases with the square of the distance. Since the temperature depends on the fourth root of the energy (since energy is proportional to T^4 via Stefan-Boltzmann), so the distance dependence is (1/a\u00b2)^(1/4) which is 1/a^(0.5). So T \u221d 1/sqrt(a).\n\nTherefore, to find the ratio T4/T2, it would be sqrt(a2/a4). Because T4 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a4), and T2 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a2). So their ratio is (1/sqrt(a4)) / (1/sqrt(a2)) = sqrt(a2/a4).\n\nNow, the problem gives the orbital periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Since the planets are in orbital resonance, their orbital periods are in the given ratios. But Kepler's third law tells us that the orbital period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed. So P^2 \u221d a^3. Therefore, the ratio of semi-major axes can be found from the ratio of the orbital periods raised to the 2/3 power.\n\nSo first, let's assign the orbital periods as per their designation. Let me note down the periods:\n\nPlanet_1: P1 = 1 unit (since the ratio is 1:2:2.5:3.5:5)\nPlanet_2: P2 = 2 units\nPlanet_4: P4 = 3.5 units",

So Planet_2 has a period ratio of 2 compared to Planet_1, and Planet_4 has 3.5. \n\nBut we need the ratio of their distances. Kepler's third law says that (P^2)/(a^3) = constant for a given star. So P^2 \u221d a^3. Therefore, a \u221d P^(2/3). \n\nSo the distance a is proportional to P^(2/3). Therefore, the ratio a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3). \n\nLet me plug in the period values.

Since the temperature depends on the fourth root of the energy (since energy is proportional to T^4 via Stefan-Boltzmann), so the distance dependence is (1/a\u00b2)^(1/4) which is 1/a^(0.5). So T \u221d 1/sqrt(a).\n\nTherefore, to find the ratio T4/T2, it would be sqrt(a2/a4). Because T4 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a4), and T2 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a2).

Since all planets are around the same star, the constant of proportionality is the same, so the ratio of a's can be found from the ratio of P's.\n\nGiven that the orbital periods are in ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planet_1 to Planet_5. Planet_2 has P2 = 2 units, Planet_4 has P4 = 3.5 units. So P2/P4 = 2/3.5 = 4/7. \n\nBut Kepler's law says (P2/P4)^2 = (a2/a4)^3 \u2192 (a2/a4) = (P2/P4)^(2/3)\n\nThen, the ratio of temperatures is sqrt( a2/a4 ) = [ (a2/a4) ]^{1/2} = [ (P2/P4)^(2/3) ]^{1/2} = (P2/P4)^{1/3}",

So the ratio of their temperatures is sqrt( (a of the other planet) / (a of the first planet) ). \n\nNow, the problem gives the orbital periods, so I need to relate the orbital period to the semi-major axis. Kepler's third law comes into play here. For a system orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a). So P^2 \u221d a^3. Therefore, a \u221d P^(2/3). \n\nSo the ratio of semi-major axes between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is (P4/P2)^(2/3). \n\nFirst, let's note the given orbital period ratios. The planets are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Let me list them as Planet_1 to Planet_5 with periods P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. \n\nSo for Planet_2, the period is 2 units, Planet_4 is 3.5 units. \n\nTherefore, the ratio P4/P2 is 3.5/2 = 1.75. \n\nTherefore, a4/a2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3). \n\nThen, the temperature ratio T4/T2 would be sqrt( a2/a4 ) = sqrt(1/( (3.5/2)^(2/3) )) )",

At x=1.728, x^(2/3)= (x^(1/3))^2= (1.2)^2=1.44. So derivative is (1/3)/1.44 \u22480.2315. So delta_x is 0.022, so the approximate delta in the cube root is 0.2315 *0.022 \u22480.005. So total cube root is 1.2 +0.005\u22481.205. \n\nThus, 1.75^(1/3) \u22481.205. Then, squaring that gives (1.205)^2 = approx 1.452. So the a4/a2 ratio is approximately 1.452. \n\nThus, the ratio a2/a4 is 1/1.452\u22480.689. \n\nTherefore, the temperature ratio T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt(0.689) \u2248 sqrt(0.69) \u2248 0.83...",

The planet's cross-section is \u03c0r\u00b2, so total incoming power is L/(4\u03c0a\u00b2) * \u03c0r\u00b2 = L r\u00b2/(4a\u00b2). \n\nThe outgoing power is \u03c3 T_eq^4 * 4\u03c0r\u00b2. \n\nSetting them equal (assuming no albedo loss, but since the question says they have the same albedo, maybe we can factor that in as (1-albedo) in the incoming side. \n\nSo: \n\n(1 - albedo) * (L/(4\u03c0a\u00b2)) * \u03c0r\u00b2 = \u03c3 T_eq^4 *4\u03c0r\u00b2 \n\nSimplify: (1 - a) L r\u00b2/(4a\u00b2) = 4\u03c0 r\u00b2 \u03c3 T_eq^4 \n\nCancel r\u00b2:\n\n(1 - a)L/(4a\u00b2) = 4\u03c0 \u03c3 T_eq^4 \n\nSolving for T_eq:\n\nT_eq = [ (1 - a) L / (16 \u03c0 \u03c3 a\u00b2) ]^(1/4 )\n\nTherefore, T_eq is proportional to ( L / a\u00b2 )^(1/4 ) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4). Since albedo is the same for both planets, when taking the ratio between the two planets, the (1 - albedo) term cancels. So the ratio depends only on ( L/a\u00b2 )^(1/4 ), and since L is same, it's (1/a\u00b2)^(1/4) = 1/a^(1/2). \n\nTherefore, T_eq \u221d 1 / sqrt(a). So the temperature ratio is indeed sqrt(a2/a4). \n\nTherefore, the previous calculation holds. \n\nSo the answer is C.",

The outgoing power is \u03c3T\u2074. \n\nThe equilibrium is when (1 - albedo) * L/(4\u03c0a\u00b2) * \u03c0R\u00b2 = 4\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 T^4 \n\nCancel terms: (1 - A) L/(4a\u00b2) = 4 \u03c3 T^4 \n\nSo T^4 = (1 - A) L / (16 \u03c0 \u03c3 a\u00b2) \n\nAssuming (1 - A) and L are constants (same star and same albedo), then T^4 \u221d 1/a\u00b2. So T \u221d 1/a^(1/2). \n\nTherefore, T is proportional to 1 over the square root of a. \n\nSo the ratio of temperatures T4 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 ). \n\nBecause T4 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a4), T2 is 1/sqrt(a2). So their ratio is (1/sqrt(a4)) / (1/sqrt(a2)) ) = sqrt(a2/a4).\n\nSo, to get T4/T2, we need sqrt( a2/a4 ). \n\nNow, we need a4/a2. \n\nFrom Kepler's law: P^2 \u221d a^3.

The absorbed power is F*(1 - A)*\u03c0r\u00b2 (cross-section area). Setting them equal: \u03c3*T_eq^4 *4\u03c0r\u00b2 = F*(1 - A)*\u03c0r\u00b2.

So to get an increase of 0.0145 from 3.048, we need (0.0145 /0.032)*0.005 added to 1.45. That's (approx 0.45 *0.005) ~0.00225. So cube root is 1.45 + 0.00225 \u22481.45225.

Therefore, a \u221d P^(2/3). \n\nSo the ratio of semi-major axes between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is (P4/P2)^(2/3). \n\nFirst, let's note the given orbital period ratios. The planets are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Let me list them as Planet_1 to Planet_5 with periods P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. \n\nSo for Planet_2, the period is 2 units, Planet_4 is 3.5 units. \n\nTherefore, the ratio P4/P2 is 3.5/2 = 1.75. \n\nTherefore, a4/a2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3). \n\nThen, the temperature ratio T4/T2 would be sqrt( a2/a4 ) = sqrt(1/( (3.5/2)^(2/3) )) )",

Let me calculate that.\n\nCube of 1.4 is 2.744 (since 1.4^3 = 2.744). 1.45^3: 1.45*1.45=2.1025, then *1.45 ~ 3.05 approximately. So 1.45 cubed is around 3.05. Which is very close to 3.0625. So the cube root of 3.0625 is approximately 1.45. So a4/a2 \u2248 1.45. \n\nNow, equilibrium temperature T is proportional to (L_star / a^2 )^(1/4), assuming L_star is the same for all planets (since same star). Because T_eq \u221d (L/(a\u00b2))^(1/4). So the ratio T4/T2 would be [ (a2 / a4)^2 ]^(1/4) ) = (a2/a4)^(0.5). Because ( (a2\u00b2)/(a4\u00b2) )^(1/4) is (a2/a4)^(1/2).",

For a planet orbiting a star, the orbital period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed: P\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3.
