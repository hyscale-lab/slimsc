Since the ester groups are on the 2 positions and nitros on 6, perhaps there's a chiral center in the biphenyl structure? Or maybe the biphenyl itself can have axial chirality. \n\nIn biphenyls, when the two rings are not in the same plane (due to steric hindrance or substitution), they can have axial chirality. The two rings can be in a staggered conformation (like the atropisomers). However, for that to be a chiral center, the molecule must not have a plane of symmetry. \n\nIn this case, the substituents on each ring are symmetric.

For example, if you rotate one ring 180 degrees relative to the other, the substituents would still match. Hence, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it's a meso compound and does not have optical isomerism. \n\nThus, option 1 does not have optical isomerism.

The 2 and 2' positions are part of the dicarboxylate esters.

So the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. \n\nThe molecule's structure would look like this:\n\nOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups on opposite sides. \n\nNow, does this molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let's see: imagine a plane that cuts through the double bond and the central carbons. The molecule is symmetric with respect to this plane. So flipping over this plane would superimpose the molecule on itself. Therefore, the molecule is achiral. \n\nHowever, what if the substituents were different? But they are the same here. So it's symmetric. \n\nTherefore, dimethyl fumarate is not chiral and doesn't have optical isomerism. \n\nHmm. So only option 2 is correct. But the options given don't have an option with just 2. The options are:\n\nA) 1,2,4\n\nB)3,4\n\nC)2,3\n\nD)1,2\n\nSo the closest is D (1 and 2), but I think 1 is not correct.",

The two ends are both COOCH3 groups. Let me see the molecular structure. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Each end (1 and 4 carbons) has a COOCH3 group. The molecule is symmetrical. So if you look at it, it's symmetric. So the molecule is trans but has symmetry. Therefore, there's no chiral center here. Because the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. The molecule is symmetric. So there's no chiral center. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate would not have optical isomerism.",

For example, if the substituents are arranged such that rotating the rings 180 degrees would lead to a different arrangement. However, in this case, the substituents are symmetric. The nitro groups are on both 6 and 6', so when you rotate one ring 180 degrees, the positions would still match. Similarly, the esters at 2 and 2' would also align. Therefore, the molecule is symmetric, so even if rotation is restricted, it's not chiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism. So the only one with optical isomerism is 2.

The arrangement in trans would mean that the groups on carbons 1 and 4 are on opposite sides of the double bond. But since those groups are the same (both OMeCO-), the molecule is symmetrical. So there is a plane of symmetry through the double bond. Therefore, it is not chiral. So dimethyl fumarate (trans) doesn't have optical isomerism. Therefore, option 4 is not correct.\n\nSo going back to the compounds:\n\n1. The first compound (biphenyl with nitro and ester groups) \u2013 I need to re-examine. Let's think again. The compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl-1,1'- means the two phenyl rings are connected at the 1-1' positions. The nitro groups are on 6 and 6', which are the positions opposite to the connection point (since in biphenyl numbering, if connected at 1 and 1', then the other positions are numbered accordingly). The 2 and 2' positions (on each ring) have the carboxylate groups, which are esterified with methyl. So each phenyl ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. The arrangement is symmetric: each ring is identical in substitution. So the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry through the central axis connecting the two phenyl rings. Therefore, the molecule is achiral. It can't have optical isomerism because it's symmetric. So option 1 is out.\n\nSo the compounds that have optical isomerism are option 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) and maybe I missed something else?",

The biphenyl structure has two benzene rings connected by a single bond.

Fumarate's structure has two carboxylic acid groups (esterified to methyl) on opposite sides of a double bond. The structure is CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3)CH2.",

So yes, all four groups are different. Therefore, the second carbon is a chiral center. Hence, this compound can have optical isomers (enantiomers). So option 2 does show optical isomerism.\n\nOption3: benzophenone. Benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. The structure is two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl group. The carbonyl carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and two oxygen atoms (as part of the ketone). The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized, so it's planar and not a chiral center. Since there are no tetrahedral centers with four different groups, benzophenone does not have optical isomerism. Also, it's symmetrical, so no chiral centers. Therefore, option3 doesn't show optical isomerism.\n\nOption4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is a dicarboxylic acid with the structure HO2CCH2COOH, but actually, fumaric acid is the trans isomer of butenedioic acid. So fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. When esterified with methanol, dimethyl fumarate would be (E)-dimethyl but-2-enedioate. Fumarate's structure has a double bond between carbons 2 and 3 (assuming the formula is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH for the acid, but actually the correct structure for fumaric acid is HO2CCH2CH2COOH?",

So the arrangement is symmetric across the biphenyl axis. The substituents on each ring are mirror images. Therefore, the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry. This would make it a meso compound, so even if individual rings have chiral centers, the overall molecule is symmetric, so no optical activity. Therefore, option1 does not have optical isomerism. Thus, only option2 is correct. But looking at the options, the only one with option2 is D (1 and 2) but that includes 1 which is wrong. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in another option?",

Each of those substituents is attached to a carbon in the benzene ring. The carbons in the benzene rings are sp2 hybridized and part of a planar structure. Since each substituent is attached to a carbon which has three other substituents (e.g., for the 2-position carbon, it has two hydrogens and another substituent?), no. Each carbon in the benzene ring has three substituents: two adjacent carbons and one substituent (like nitro or ester). So they are not chiral centers. The only possible chiral centers would be if a carbon has four different groups, but in the benzene rings or the connecting bonds, there are no such carbons. \n\nTherefore, compound 1 has no chiral centers or axes, so no optical isomerism.\n\nThus, the only correct answer is 2. Since that's not an option alone, but option D includes 2 and 1, which is wrong. Option C includes 2 and 3, but 3 is wrong. Option A includes 2 but also 1 and4. Option B includes 3 and4.\n\nHmm.

Let me try to see another angle for option1. Suppose the biphenyl has a nitro and carboxylate group such that the molecule is not symmetrical. For example, maybe the nitro and carboxylate are on the same side, making it asymmetric. But the question specifies 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. The positions 6 and 2 are opposite each other on the biphenyl rings. If each ring has the nitro at 6 and the carboxylate at 2, then the substituents are placed symmetrically. Hence, the molecule is symmetrical. So no chiral center.\n\nHmm, I'm really stuck. Perhaps I need to think of examples. For instance, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid) is a chiral compound. Its methyl ester would retain the chiral center, so that's correct. So option2 is correct. The other options don't have chiral centers. The options given don't have an option with just 2, so perhaps there's an error in the question. But since I have to choose from the options, maybe I made a mistake in option4?",

That's a benzene ring attached to a ketone. The structure is (C6H5)2CO. The central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and a carbonyl oxygen.

The central carbon is part of the ketone, so it's a carbonyl group between two phenyl rings. The structure is symmetric because both sides are phenyl groups. Since the central carbon has two phenyl groups and a carbonyl, it doesn't have four different groups. Thus, there's no chiral center here.

The nitro groups are on 6 and 6', which are the positions opposite to the connection point (since in biphenyl numbering, if connected at 1 and 1', then the other positions are numbered accordingly). The 2 and 2' positions (on each ring) have the carboxylate groups, which are esterified with methyl. So each phenyl ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. The arrangement is symmetric: each ring is identical in substitution. So the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry through the central axis connecting the two phenyl rings. Therefore, the molecule is achiral. It can't have optical isomerism because it's symmetric.

The biphenyl structure has two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The 6 and 6' positions are the meta positions on each ring (since biphenyl numbering is such that the first ring is 1-5, and the second is 1'-5'). The nitro groups are on the 6 and 6' positions.

Since biphenyls themselves don't have a central chiral carbon, but can they be chiral due to substituents?\n\nIn this case, each ring has nitro at 6 and ester at 2. Let me see if the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry. \n\nImagine looking at the biphenyl: the two rings are connected at positions 1-1'. The substituents on each ring are on the 6 and 2 positions. Let me think of each ring:\n\nOn the left ring, positions 1 is connected to the other ring. The nitro is on 6, and the ester on 2. Similarly on the right ring. Let me consider the positions. In biphenyl numbering, the two rings are connected at 1-1', so positions on each ring are numbered such that the lowest numbers are near the connection. \n\nIf on both rings, the substituents are placed symmetrically, then the whole molecule may have a plane of symmetry. For instance, if the nitro on 6 and ester on 2 on each ring are arranged such that the molecule is symmetric when flipped over the plane through the central bond.",

So 6 and 6' both have nitro groups.\n\n- The 2,2'-dicarboxylate means each ring has a carboxylate group at the 2 position. Since it's dimethyl, those carboxylates are esterified with methyl groups. So each ring's 2-position has a -OOCCH3 group.\n\nThe structure would have two benzene rings connected at the 1-1' positions.

Each of those substituents is attached to a carbon in the benzene ring. The carbons in the benzene rings are sp2 hybridized and part of a planar structure. Since each substituent is attached to a carbon which has three other substituents (e.g., for the 2-position carbon, it has two hydrogens and another substituent?), no.

This would make it a meso compound, so even if individual rings have chiral centers, the overall molecule is symmetric, so no optical activity. Therefore, option1 does not have optical isomerism. Thus, only option2 is correct. But looking at the options, the only one with option2 is D (1 and 2) but that includes 1 which is wrong. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in another option?",

The biphenyl system can sometimes have chirality if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically. However, in this case, the substituents at 6 and 6' (nitro groups) and 2 and 2' (methyl esters) are on both rings in a symmetrical fashion. For example, if you look at each ring, the nitro is on the 6th position, which is directly opposite the connecting position (since 1-1', so 6 is three carbons away). The carboxylates at 2 and 2' are also symmetrical. So the entire molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the line connecting the two phenyl rings. Therefore, no chiral centers. So option 1 doesn't have optical isomerism. \n\nTherefore, the only correct one is option 2. But looking at the options, D is 1 and 2. Since 1 is incorrect, D is wrong.

The biphenyl is connected at the 1-1' positions. The 6 and 6' positions (each on their own ring) have nitro groups. The 2 and 2' positions (again on each ring) have the carboxylate groups which are esterified with methyl. \n\nSo the structure would have two benzene rings connected at 1-1'. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. The carboxylates are ester groups (dimethyl, so each 2 position has a methoxy group attached via the ester linkage). \n\nNow, the key is whether this molecule has a chiral center or not. Since the ester groups are on the 2 positions and nitros on 6, perhaps there's a chiral center in the biphenyl structure? Or maybe the biphenyl itself can have axial chirality. \n\nIn biphenyls, when the two rings are not in the same plane (due to steric hindrance or substitution), they can have axial chirality. The two rings can be in a staggered conformation (like the atropisomers). However, for that to be a chiral center, the molecule must not have a plane of symmetry. \n\nIn this case, the substituents on each ring are symmetric. The 6 positions have nitro groups, and the 2 positions have the ester groups. Since each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2, the arrangement is symmetric. For example, if you rotate one ring 180 degrees relative to the other, the substituents would still match. Hence, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it's a meso compound and does not have optical isomerism. \n\nThus, option 1 does not have optical isomerism.

The numbering for biphenyl can be such that the central bond is between 1-1', so the numbering on each ring starts from that. \n\nNow, the key question is whether this molecule has a chiral center. Since biphenyls themselves don't have a central chiral carbon, but can they be chiral due to substituents?\n\nIn this case, each ring has nitro at 6 and ester at 2. Let me see if the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry. \n\nImagine looking at the biphenyl: the two rings are connected at positions 1-1'.
