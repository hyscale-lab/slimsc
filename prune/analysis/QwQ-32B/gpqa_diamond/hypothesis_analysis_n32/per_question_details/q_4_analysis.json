Amp\u00e8re's Law with Maxwell's correction and monopoles: \u2207\u00d7B = \u03bc\u2080 J_e + (1/\u03b5\u2080) \u2202E/\u2202t + (\u03bc\u2080/\u03b5\u2080)(\u2202\u03c1_m/\u2202t) ?",

So that would include both equation 3 and 2.\n\nOption C: circulation of B (Amp\u00e8re-Maxwell) and flux of E (which I'm not sure what that refers to; maybe Gauss's Law for E? But that's unchanged unless there are magnetic monopoles, but the flux of E is Gauss's Law for E, which doesn't involve B. So maybe flux of E is Gauss's Law for E, which is equation 1, but that remains the same. Hmm, maybe \"flux of the electric field\" is Gauss's Law for E, which isn't changing here. So option C might be incorrect.\n\nOption D: divergence and curl of the magnetic field. The divergence is changing, but the curl (equation 4, which is about curl B) would that be changing? Let me see. If the Amp\u00e8re's Law (curl B) would have an extra term, then the curl part (the equation involving curl B) would also change, so the curl of B's equation would change. So the curl of B (equation 4) would involve an extra term. So then, the equations that are different would be both the divergence of B (equation 2) and the curl of B (equation 4).",
