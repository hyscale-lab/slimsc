Here's the mistake! I thought the factor was 1.22, but that's the ratio when using diameter. Let me see. Let me recalculate this carefully.\n\nThe standard formula for the first minimum angle is:\n\n\u03b8 \u2248 1.22 \u03bb/D, where D is the diameter.\n\nBut in this case, the problem gives the apothem a, which for a circle is the radius.

Since D is 2a, substituting gives 1.22 * lambda/(2a) = 0.61 lambda/a. \n\nTherefore, the angular distance between the first minimum and the central maximum is that value.

Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe question states: \"the angular distance between the first two minima\". In diffraction patterns, the first minimum is the first dark spot away from the center. Since it's symmetric, there's one on each side. So the two first minima are on either side, each at angle theta from the center. The angular distance between them would be 2*theta. So 2*(0.610) = 1.22 \u03bb/a (option C). But the options have C as 1.22 \u03bb/a, which matches that. But then why is there an option A?",

That is, the two first minima on each side, so the angle between them is twice the angle to the first minimum. \n\nThe question's wording is crucial here. \n\nThe problem says \"the angular distance between the first two minima\". The first two minima would be the two minima closest to the central peak, so the first minimum on each side.

So if the apothem a is the radius (since in the case of a circle, apothem = radius), then D = 2a. Therefore, substituting D=2a into the formula gives theta \u2248 1.22 * lambda/(2a) = 0.61 lambda/a. That would be option A. \n\nAh! So I think my confusion was whether the formula uses the radius or diameter. Since the standard formula uses the diameter D, but here the problem gives the apothem (radius), so substituting D=2a is correct, leading to 0.61. So the angular distance from the center to the first minimum is 0.61 \u03bb/a. \n\nBut the problem says \"the angular distance between the first two minima\".",
