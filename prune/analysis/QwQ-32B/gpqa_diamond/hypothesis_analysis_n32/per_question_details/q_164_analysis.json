Since v1 = K1 (the radial velocity amplitude) if the orbit is edge-on (since then the projected velocity is the actual velocity).

          "text2": "Wait, but maybe I should use different notation to avoid confusion. Let me say for system_1, the two stars are m1a and m1b. Their K values are K1a =10, K1b=5. So m1a / m1b = (K1b)/(K1a) =5/10 =0.5. So m1a = 0.5 m1b. Therefore the total mass of system_1 is m1a + m1b = 1.5 m1b. \n\nSimilarly, for system_2, the stars have K2a=15 and K2b=10. So mass ratio m2a/m2b = 10/15 = 2/3. So m2a = (2/3)m2b. Total mass of system_2 is m2a + m2b = (5/3)m2b. \n\nNow, how do I relate these to find the total masses? I think I need another relation involving the orbital period. Because right now, the masses are in terms of each other, but I need the actual masses. \n\nAh, using Kepler's third law. The orbital period P is related to the sum of the masses and the separation. The formula is (M1 + M2) * P^2 = (a1 + a2)^3 * (4\u03c0\u00b2/G). But since a1 + a2 = a (the semi-major axis of the orbit), perhaps I can write it as:\n\n(M1 + M2) * P^2 = (a)^3 * (4\u03c0\u00b2/G)\n\nBut I don't know the separation a. However, the radial velocity is related to the orbital speed. The orbital speed v is related to the orbital period and the separation.",

So the mass of star A is half that of star B in system 1. Therefore, the total mass of system 1 is M1a + M1b = 0.5 M1b + M1b = 1.5 M1b. \n\nSimilarly, in system 2, the velocities are 15 and 10 km/s. So the mass ratio M2a/M2b = 10/15 = 2/3. Therefore, M2a = (2/3) M2b. Total mass is (2/3 M2b) + M2b = (5/3) M2b. \n\nBut to find the total mass of each system, we need another relation involving the orbital period. \n\nThe formula for the total mass of the binary system (assuming edge-on, circular orbits, so sin i=1 and e=0) is given by:\n\nM_total = ( ( K1 * K2 * P ) / ( 2.8677 ) )^(2/3) * ( (K1 + K2)^2 / (K1^2 + K2^2) ) )^(something?",

The velocities are inversely proportional to their masses, so K1/K2 = v1/v2 = (M2/M1). Because v1 = (2\u03c0 a1)/P and v2 = (2\u03c0 a2)/P, and a1/a2 = M2/M1.\n\nThus, K1/K2 = v1/v2 = (a1/a2) = M2/M1.

So maybe that allows us to get the actual masses, not just the mass function.\n\nLet me think of using the formula for the total mass of the system. \n\nThe formula that relates the masses and the velocity amplitudes is:\n\nK1 / K2 = M2 / M1 \n\nThis comes from the fact that the gravitational attraction between the two stars provides the centripetal acceleration for both. So the velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. \n\nTherefore, if in system 1, the two stars have velocities K1a =10 km/s and K1b=5 km/s, then the mass ratio M1a/M1b = K1b/K1a = 5/10 = 0.5.

Since the stars are in circular orbits (assuming circular for simplicity), their orbital speeds are v1 = 2\u03c0 a1 / P, v2 = 2\u03c0 a2 / P. \n\nAlso, the total separation a = a1 + a2. \n\nBut from the center of mass condition, m1 a1 = m2 a2 \u2192 a1/a2 = m2/m1 \u2192 a1 = (m2/m1) a2. \n\nThus, a = a1 +a2 = (m2/m1 +1 ) a2 \u2192 a2 = a/(1 + m2/m1 )\n\nThen, the velocity v1 = 2\u03c0 a1 / P = 2\u03c0 (m2 a2)/(m1 P) \n\nSubstituting a2 from above: \n\nv1 = 2\u03c0 (m2 / m1 ) * ( a / (1 + m2/m1 )) / P \n\nBut a is the total separation. To relate this to Kepler's third law, we can use that:\n\n(m1 + m2) = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3) / (G P\u00b2 )\n\nSo, a\u00b3 = ( G P\u00b2 (m1 + m2) ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nTherefore, a = [ (G P\u00b2 (m1 + m2) ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nThis might not be helpful.",
          "text2": "Alternatively, the radial velocity semi-amplitudes K1 and K2 are related to the masses via:\n\nK1 = (v orb,2) = (2\u03c0 a2)/(P) \n\nand similarly K2 = (2\u03c0 a1)/P \n\nBecause each star's orbital speed is 2\u03c0 a / P, where a is the semi-major axis. \n\nSo, since the two stars orbit around the center of mass, a1 + a2 = a (the total separation between the two stars). \n\nBut the masses are inversely proportional to their distances from the center of mass. So M1 / M2 = a2 / a1 \u2192 M1 = (a2/a1) * M2. \n\nAlso, K1 = (2\u03c0 a2)/(P) \u2192 a2 = (K1 P)/(2\u03c0 )\n\nSimilarly, a1 = (K2 P)/(2\u03c0 )\n\nThus, M1/M2 = a2/a1 = (K1/K2)\n\nWhich matches the earlier ratio. So that's consistent. \n\nNow, the total mass M_total = M1 + M2. Let's express M_total in terms of one of the masses. \n\nFor system 1, since M2 = 2*M1 \u2192 total M = 3*M1. \n\nBut how do we get the actual mass?

Since the two stars orbit their common center of mass, their velocities must satisfy m1*v1 = m2*v2. Therefore, m1/m2 = v2/v1. So their mass ratio is the inverse of their velocity ratio. \n\nBut the question is about the total mass of each system. Let's see.

The velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So, for system_1: m1/m2 = K2/K1 = 5/10 = 0.5. So m1 = 0.5 * m2. Therefore total mass M_total1 = m1 + m2 = 0.5 m2 + m2 = 1.5 m2.

Therefore m2' = (3/5) M_total2, and m1' = (2/5) M_total2.\n\nNow, to find the total masses, we need to relate them to the orbital periods.

Since the problem asks for the ratio of the total masses of the two systems (M1/M2), perhaps I can find an expression for M1 and M2 in terms of their K values and periods, then take the ratio, assuming that the inclination angle sin i is the same for both systems (since we can't know it, but if they ask for a ratio, maybe it cancels).\n\nLet me try to derive it. \n\nThe radial velocity amplitude K for each star is given by:\n\nK1 = (v1 sin i) \n\nwhere v1 is the orbital speed of star1.

So, from before, v1 / v2 = M2/M1.\n\nSo for system 1, the ratio of velocities between the two stars is 10/5 = 2. Therefore, their masses are inversely proportional. So M1a / M1b = (v1b / v1a) = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1a = 0.5 * M1b. Therefore, total mass M1_total = M1a + M1b = 1.5 * M1b. \n\nSimilarly for system 2, the velocities are 15 and 10. So their ratio is 15/10 = 1.5. So the mass ratio would be M2a/M2b = (v2b / v2a) = 10/15 = 2/3. So M2a = (2/3) M2b. Then total mass is (2/3 M2b) + M2b = (5/3) M2b.\n\nBut how does this help us find the total mass of the systems? Because we still need to relate the masses to the period and velocities.",

So the ratio of masses is inversely proportional to the ratio of their velocities. \n\nAh, that's an important point. Since the two stars orbit their common center of mass, their velocities must satisfy m1*v1 = m2*v2. Therefore, m1/m2 = v2/v1. So their mass ratio is the inverse of their velocity ratio. \n\nBut the question is about the total mass of each system. Let's see. Let me note down the given data first.\n\nFor system_1:\n- Orbital period P1 = 2 years\n- RV amplitudes: K1 = 10 km/s, K2 = 5 km/s\n\nFor system_2:\n- Orbital period P2 = 1 year\n- RV amplitudes: K1' = 15 km/s, K2' = 10 km/s\n\nWe need to find (M1 + M2) / (M1' + M2') where M1 and M2 are the masses of system_1, and M1' and M2' of system_2.\n\nFirst, let's handle system_1. The velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So, for system_1: m1/m2 = K2/K1 = 5/10 = 0.5. So m1 = 0.5 * m2. Therefore total mass M_total1 = m1 + m2 = 0.5 m2 + m2 = 1.5 m2. So m2 = (2/3) M_total1, and m1 = (1/3) M_total1. \n\nSimilarly for system_2: m1'/m2' = K2'/K1' = 10/15 = 2/3. So m1' = (2/3) m2'. So total mass M_total2 = m1' + m2' = (2/3 m2') + m2' = (5/3 m2'). Therefore m2' = (3/5) M_total2, and m1' = (2/5) M_total2.\n\nNow, to find the total masses, we need to relate them to the orbital periods. Because the orbital period depends on the total mass and the orbital separation. The formula that relates the orbital period, total mass, and the semi-major axis is from Kepler's third law:\n\nP^2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / G(M1 + M2)) ) * a^3, where a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. \n\nBut in binary stars, the total mass is related to the sum of the masses, and the semi-major axes of the two stars add up to the total separation a = a1 + a2.
