          "text1": "Wait, but wait, maybe the temperature as measured via Wien's law is affected by the Doppler effect. Because if the star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength would be shifted. \n\nOh! That's probably the key here. Because the peak wavelength they observed (\u03bb_max) is affected by the radial velocity. So the actual peak wavelength (in the rest frame of the star) would be different from what's observed. Because of the Doppler effect. So we need to adjust the temperatures based on the radial velocity.\n\nRight. Let me think again. The observed \u03bb_max_observed for Star_2 would be shifted due to its motion. Let's recall the Doppler shift formula. The observed wavelength \u03bb_obs is related to the emitted wavelength \u03bb_emit by:\n\n\u03bb_obs = \u03bb_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) \n\nBut since the velocities are much smaller than the speed of light (700 km/s is 0.7% of c, since c is about 3e5 km/s), maybe we can approximate using the relativistic Doppler shift formula for small velocities?",
          "text2": "Wait, the problem mentions that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. How does that play into this? Oh, radial velocity might affect the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift. But the question says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found them to be the same. So if the measured peak wavelengths are the same, does that mean their actual temperatures (in their rest frames) are different? Because the Doppler effect would shift the observed wavelength. \n\nLet me think. Suppose Star_2 is moving away from us at 700 km/s. Its emitted peak wavelength would be redshifted. But the problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So the true temperatures (in their own frames) must be different so that when you account for the Doppler shift, their observed peak wavelengths match. \n\nAh, right! So Wien's law applies to the rest frame of the star. The observed peak wavelength is \u03bb_observed = \u03bb_emitted * (1 + v/c), where v is the velocity. Since Star_1 has velocity 0, its observed \u03bb_peak is the same as its emitted. Star_2 has a velocity of 700 km/s. Since velocity is given in km/s, I need to convert that to a fraction of the speed of light to compute the Doppler shift factor. \n\nLet me compute v/c for Star_2. The speed of light c is approximately 3 x 10^5 km/s. So 700 km/s divided by 3e5 gives 700 / 300000 = 0.002333... So that's approximately 0.002333. Since the velocity is positive (assuming it's moving away?), the observed wavelength would be longer (redshifted). But the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same. So if Star_2 is moving away, its emitted peak wavelength must be shorter than Star_1's emitted peak wavelength so that when redshifted, it matches the observed wavelength of Star_1. \n\nLet me denote the emitted peak wavelengths as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 for Star_1 and Star_2. The observed wavelength for Star_1 is \u03bb1 (since v=0). The observed for Star_2 is \u03bb2*(1 + v/c). These are equal. So:\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb2*(1 + v/c)\n\nBut according to Wien's law, \u03bb1 = b / T1 and \u03bb2 = b / T2. \n\nTherefore substituting:\n\nb/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v/c)\n\nCanceling b from both sides:\n\n1/T1 = (1/T2)(1 + v/c)\n\nSo rearranged, T2 = T1*(1 + v/c)\n\nTherefore, the temperature of Star_2 is higher than Star_1's temperature by a factor of (1 + v/c).",

But the problem says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found them the same. So does that mean that the intrinsic temperatures (before Doppler shift) are the same, or the observed ones?\n\nHmm, that's a good question. Let me think. The Doppler effect would shift the observed wavelength. If the stars are moving, then the observed peak wavelength would be different from the actual peak. But the problem says that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So maybe the intrinsic peak wavelengths (before any Doppler shift) are different, but when adjusted for the velocity, they result in the same observed value. \n\nSo, let's clarify. Wien's Law gives the peak wavelength as lambda_peak = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. But if there's a Doppler shift, the observed wavelength lambda_obs is lambda_peak*(1 + v/c) for a receding velocity v. Since one is moving and the other isn't, their actual temperatures might be different, but after the Doppler shift, their observed peak wavelengths are the same. \n\nAh, that must be it! So I need to consider the Doppler effect here. \n\nLet me formalize this. Let\u2019s denote Star_1 has velocity v1 = 0, so no Doppler shift. Star_2 has velocity v2 = 700 km/s, which is moving away (assuming positive velocity is receding). \n\nThe observed peak wavelength for Star_1 is lambda1_obs = lambda1_peak*(1 + v1/c) \u2248 lambda1_peak*(1 + 0) = lambda1_peak. Since v1 is 0. \n\nFor Star_2, moving away at 700 km/s, the observed peak wavelength is lambda2_obs = lambda2_peak*(1 + v2/c). \n\nThe problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same, so lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs. \n\nTherefore, lambda1_peak = lambda2_peak*(1 + v2/c). \n\nBut since lambda_peak is proportional to 1/T (from Wien's law), so T is proportional to 1/lambda_peak. \n\nSo T1 / T2 = (lambda2_peak / lambda1_peak) \n\nBut since lambda1_peak = lambda2_peak*(1 + v2/c), substituting: \n\nT1 / T2 = (lambda2_peak) / [lambda2_peak*(1 + v2/c)] ) = 1/(1 + v2/c) \n\nSo T1 = T2/(1 + v2/c) \n\nHmm, so the actual temperatures of the stars are not the same. The observed peak is same, but intrinsic temperatures differ due to the Doppler shift. \n\nTherefore, I can't assume the temperatures are equal.

Because if the star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength would be shifted. \n\nOh! That's probably the key here. Because the peak wavelength they observed (\u03bb_max) is affected by the radial velocity. So the actual peak wavelength (in the rest frame of the star) would be different from what's observed. Because of the Doppler effect. So we need to adjust the temperatures based on the radial velocity.\n\nRight. Let me think again. The observed \u03bb_max_observed for Star_2 would be shifted due to its motion. Let's recall the Doppler shift formula. The observed wavelength \u03bb_obs is related to the emitted wavelength \u03bb_emit by:\n\n\u03bb_obs = \u03bb_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) \n\nBut since the velocities are much smaller than the speed of light (700 km/s is 0.7% of c, since c is about 3e5 km/s), maybe we can approximate using the relativistic Doppler shift formula for small velocities?",
          "text2": "Wait, the problem mentions that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. How does that play into this? Oh, radial velocity might affect the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift. But the question says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found them to be the same. So if the measured peak wavelengths are the same, does that mean their actual temperatures (in their rest frames) are different? Because the Doppler effect would shift the observed wavelength. \n\nLet me think. Suppose Star_2 is moving away from us at 700 km/s. Its emitted peak wavelength would be redshifted. But the problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So the true temperatures (in their own frames) must be different so that when you account for the Doppler shift, their observed peak wavelengths match. \n\nAh, right! So Wien's law applies to the rest frame of the star. The observed peak wavelength is \u03bb_observed = \u03bb_emitted * (1 + v/c), where v is the velocity. Since Star_1 has velocity 0, its observed \u03bb_peak is the same as its emitted. Star_2 has a velocity of 700 km/s. Since velocity is given in km/s, I need to convert that to a fraction of the speed of light to compute the Doppler shift factor. \n\nLet me compute v/c for Star_2. The speed of light c is approximately 3 x 10^5 km/s. So 700 km/s divided by 3e5 gives 700 / 300000 = 0.002333... So that's approximately 0.002333. Since the velocity is positive (assuming it's moving away?), the observed wavelength would be longer (redshifted). But the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same. So if Star_2 is moving away, its emitted peak wavelength must be shorter than Star_1's emitted peak wavelength so that when redshifted, it matches the observed wavelength of Star_1. \n\nLet me denote the emitted peak wavelengths as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 for Star_1 and Star_2. The observed wavelength for Star_1 is \u03bb1 (since v=0). The observed for Star_2 is \u03bb2*(1 + v/c). These are equal. So:\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb2*(1 + v/c)\n\nBut according to Wien's law, \u03bb1 = b / T1 and \u03bb2 = b / T2. \n\nTherefore substituting:\n\nb/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v/c)\n\nCanceling b from both sides:\n\n1/T1 = (1/T2)(1 + v/c)\n\nSo rearranged, T2 = T1*(1 + v/c)\n\nTherefore, the temperature of Star_2 is higher than Star_1's temperature by a factor of (1 + v/c).",

But the problem says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found them the same. So does that mean that the intrinsic temperatures (before Doppler shift) are the same, or the observed ones?\n\nHmm, that's a good question. Let me think. The Doppler effect would shift the observed wavelength. If the stars are moving, then the observed peak wavelength would be different from the actual peak. But the problem says that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So maybe the intrinsic peak wavelengths (before any Doppler shift) are different, but when adjusted for the velocity, they result in the same observed value. \n\nSo, let's clarify. Wien's Law gives the peak wavelength as lambda_peak = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. But if there's a Doppler shift, the observed wavelength lambda_obs is lambda_peak*(1 + v/c) for a receding velocity v. Since one is moving and the other isn't, their actual temperatures might be different, but after the Doppler shift, their observed peak wavelengths are the same. \n\nAh, that must be it! So I need to consider the Doppler effect here. \n\nLet me formalize this. Let\u2019s denote Star_1 has velocity v1 = 0, so no Doppler shift. Star_2 has velocity v2 = 700 km/s, which is moving away (assuming positive velocity is receding). \n\nThe observed peak wavelength for Star_1 is lambda1_obs = lambda1_peak*(1 + v1/c) \u2248 lambda1_peak*(1 + 0) = lambda1_peak. Since v1 is 0. \n\nFor Star_2, moving away at 700 km/s, the observed peak wavelength is lambda2_obs = lambda2_peak*(1 + v2/c). \n\nThe problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same, so lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs. \n\nTherefore, lambda1_peak = lambda2_peak*(1 + v2/c). \n\nBut since lambda_peak is proportional to 1/T (from Wien's law), so T is proportional to 1/lambda_peak. \n\nSo T1 / T2 = (lambda2_peak / lambda1_peak) \n\nBut since lambda1_peak = lambda2_peak*(1 + v2/c), substituting: \n\nT1 / T2 = (lambda2_peak) / [lambda2_peak*(1 + v2/c)] ) = 1/(1 + v2/c) \n\nSo T1 = T2/(1 + v2/c) \n\nHmm, so the actual temperatures of the stars are not the same. The observed peak is same, but intrinsic temperatures differ due to the Doppler shift. \n\nTherefore, I can't assume the temperatures are equal. The original assumption was wrong. \n\nTherefore, I need to account for this. Let me recalculate. \n\nLet me denote variables:\n\nLet\u2019s let v2 = 700 km/s. Since it's moving away, the Doppler factor is (1 + v/c). But c is the speed of light, which is about 3e5 km/s. \n\nSo v/c = 700 / 3e5 \u2248 0.002333. So 1 + v/c \u2248 1.002333. \n\nTherefore, the observed wavelength equality gives:\n\nlambda1_peak = lambda2_peak * (1 + v/c). \n\nHence, the ratio of the intrinsic peak wavelengths is lambda1_peak / lambda2_peak = 1 + v/c. \n\nSince lambda_peak is inversely proportional to temperature, then:\n\nT1 / T2 = (lambda2_peak / lambda1_peak) = 1/(1 + v/c). \n\nThus, T1 = T2/(1 + v/c). \n\nTherefore, the temperatures are not equal. \n\nNow, luminosity is L = 4\u03c0 R\u00b2 \u03c3 T\u2074. \n\nSo the ratio L1/L2 = (R1\u00b2/R2\u00b2) * (T1/T2)^4. \n\nWe know R1/R2 = 1.5, so R1\u00b2/R2\u00b2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. \n\nThe T ratio: (T1/T2)^4 = [1/(1 + v/c)]^4. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nL1/L2 = 2.25 * [1/(1 + v/c)]^4.",

But the problem says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found them the same.

The Doppler effect would shift the observed wavelength. If the stars are moving, then the observed peak wavelength would be different from the actual peak. But the problem says that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So maybe the intrinsic peak wavelengths (before any Doppler shift) are different, but when adjusted for the velocity, they result in the same observed value. \n\nSo, let's clarify. Wien's Law gives the peak wavelength as lambda_peak = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. But if there's a Doppler shift, the observed wavelength lambda_obs is lambda_peak*(1 + v/c) for a receding velocity v. Since one is moving and the other isn't, their actual temperatures might be different, but after the Doppler shift, their observed peak wavelengths are the same. \n\nAh, that must be it! So I need to consider the Doppler effect here. \n\nLet me formalize this. Let\u2019s denote Star_1 has velocity v1 = 0, so no Doppler shift. Star_2 has velocity v2 = 700 km/s, which is moving away (assuming positive velocity is receding). \n\nThe observed peak wavelength for Star_1 is lambda1_obs = lambda1_peak*(1 + v1/c) \u2248 lambda1_peak*(1 + 0) = lambda1_peak. Since v1 is 0. \n\nFor Star_2, moving away at 700 km/s, the observed peak wavelength is lambda2_obs = lambda2_peak*(1 + v2/c). \n\nThe problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same, so lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs. \n\nTherefore, lambda1_peak = lambda2_peak*(1 + v2/c). \n\nBut since lambda_peak is proportional to 1/T (from Wien's law), so T is proportional to 1/lambda_peak. \n\nSo T1 / T2 = (lambda2_peak / lambda1_peak) \n\nBut since lambda1_peak = lambda2_peak*(1 + v2/c), substituting: \n\nT1 / T2 = (lambda2_peak) / [lambda2_peak*(1 + v2/c)] ) = 1/(1 + v2/c) \n\nSo T1 = T2/(1 + v2/c) \n\nHmm, so the actual temperatures of the stars are not the same. The observed peak is same, but intrinsic temperatures differ due to the Doppler shift. \n\nTherefore, I can't assume the temperatures are equal. The original assumption was wrong. \n\nTherefore, I need to account for this. Let me recalculate. \n\nLet me denote variables:\n\nLet\u2019s let v2 = 700 km/s. Since it's moving away, the Doppler factor is (1 + v/c). But c is the speed of light, which is about 3e5 km/s. \n\nSo v/c = 700 / 3e5 \u2248 0.002333. So 1 + v/c \u2248 1.002333. \n\nTherefore, the observed wavelength equality gives:\n\nlambda1_peak = lambda2_peak * (1 + v/c). \n\nHence, the ratio of the intrinsic peak wavelengths is lambda1_peak / lambda2_peak = 1 + v/c. \n\nSince lambda_peak is inversely proportional to temperature, then:\n\nT1 / T2 = (lambda2_peak / lambda1_peak) = 1/(1 + v/c). \n\nThus, T1 = T2/(1 + v/c). \n\nTherefore, the temperatures are not equal. \n\nNow, luminosity is L = 4\u03c0 R\u00b2 \u03c3 T\u2074. \n\nSo the ratio L1/L2 = (R1\u00b2/R2\u00b2) * (T1/T2)^4. \n\nWe know R1/R2 = 1.5, so R1\u00b2/R2\u00b2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. \n\nThe T ratio: (T1/T2)^4 = [1/(1 + v/c)]^4. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nL1/L2 = 2.25 * [1/(1 + v/c)]^4.",

Since the sign matters, but maybe the problem assumes that the velocities are given with the direction such that the Doppler shift is accounted for. \n\nHowever, since the observed peak wavelengths are the same, we can write:\n\n\u03bb_obs1 = \u03bb_obs2 \n\nThe observed wavelength for Star_1 is just its intrinsic \u03bb_max1. The observed wavelength for Star_2 is \u03bb_max2 * (1 + v2/c), assuming it's moving away (v positive). Since their observed wavelengths are equal, so:\n\n\u03bb_max1 = \u03bb_max2 * (1 + v2/c)\n\nBut since v is much smaller than c (700 km/s vs 3e5 km/s), so 700/(3e5) is about 0.0023, so the factor is roughly 1.0023. Therefore, \u03bb_max1 \u2248 \u03bb_max2 * 1.0023. \n\nBut according to Wien's Law, the intrinsic \u03bb_max is inversely proportional to temperature.

Because if the star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength would be shifted. \n\nOh! That's probably the key here. Because the peak wavelength they observed (\u03bb_max) is affected by the radial velocity. So the actual peak wavelength (in the rest frame of the star) would be different from what's observed. Because of the Doppler effect. So we need to adjust the temperatures based on the radial velocity.\n\nRight. Let me think again. The observed \u03bb_max_observed for Star_2 would be shifted due to its motion. Let's recall the Doppler shift formula. The observed wavelength \u03bb_obs is related to the emitted wavelength \u03bb_emit by:\n\n\u03bb_obs = \u03bb_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) \n\nBut since the velocities are much smaller than the speed of light (700 km/s is 0.7% of c, since c is about 3e5 km/s), maybe we can approximate using the relativistic Doppler shift formula for small velocities?",
          "text2": "Wait, the problem mentions that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. How does that play into this? Oh, radial velocity might affect the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift. But the question says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found them to be the same. So if the measured peak wavelengths are the same, does that mean their actual temperatures (in their rest frames) are different? Because the Doppler effect would shift the observed wavelength. \n\nLet me think. Suppose Star_2 is moving away from us at 700 km/s. Its emitted peak wavelength would be redshifted. But the problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So the true temperatures (in their own frames) must be different so that when you account for the Doppler shift, their observed peak wavelengths match. \n\nAh, right! So Wien's law applies to the rest frame of the star. The observed peak wavelength is \u03bb_observed = \u03bb_emitted * (1 + v/c), where v is the velocity. Since Star_1 has velocity 0, its observed \u03bb_peak is the same as its emitted. Star_2 has a velocity of 700 km/s. Since velocity is given in km/s, I need to convert that to a fraction of the speed of light to compute the Doppler shift factor. \n\nLet me compute v/c for Star_2. The speed of light c is approximately 3 x 10^5 km/s. So 700 km/s divided by 3e5 gives 700 / 300000 = 0.002333... So that's approximately 0.002333. Since the velocity is positive (assuming it's moving away?), the observed wavelength would be longer (redshifted). But the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same. So if Star_2 is moving away, its emitted peak wavelength must be shorter than Star_1's emitted peak wavelength so that when redshifted, it matches the observed wavelength of Star_1. \n\nLet me denote the emitted peak wavelengths as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 for Star_1 and Star_2. The observed wavelength for Star_1 is \u03bb1 (since v=0). The observed for Star_2 is \u03bb2*(1 + v/c). These are equal. So:\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb2*(1 + v/c)\n\nBut according to Wien's law, \u03bb1 = b / T1 and \u03bb2 = b / T2. \n\nTherefore substituting:\n\nb/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v/c)\n\nCanceling b from both sides:\n\n1/T1 = (1/T2)(1 + v/c)\n\nSo rearranged, T2 = T1*(1 + v/c)\n\nTherefore, the temperature of Star_2 is higher than Star_1's temperature by a factor of (1 + v/c).",

But the observed \u03bb_max is shifted due to the Doppler effect. The problem states that the observed \u03bb_max for both stars are the same.

So, the Doppler effect would shift their emitted peak wavelengths. Therefore, their actual temperatures (and thus their intrinsic \u03bb_max) would be different, but when observed, they have the same \u03bb_max. Therefore, we need to account for that shift to find their actual temperatures, which then affects their luminosities.\n\nOkay, let's break that down.

But the problem says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found them the same. So does that mean that the intrinsic temperatures (before Doppler shift) are the same, or the observed ones?\n\nHmm, that's a good question. Let me think. The Doppler effect would shift the observed wavelength. If the stars are moving, then the observed peak wavelength would be different from the actual peak. But the problem says that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So maybe the intrinsic peak wavelengths (before any Doppler shift) are different, but when adjusted for the velocity, they result in the same observed value. \n\nSo, let's clarify. Wien's Law gives the peak wavelength as lambda_peak = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. But if there's a Doppler shift, the observed wavelength lambda_obs is lambda_peak*(1 + v/c) for a receding velocity v. Since one is moving and the other isn't, their actual temperatures might be different, but after the Doppler shift, their observed peak wavelengths are the same. \n\nAh, that must be it! So I need to consider the Doppler effect here. \n\nLet me formalize this. Let\u2019s denote Star_1 has velocity v1 = 0, so no Doppler shift. Star_2 has velocity v2 = 700 km/s, which is moving away (assuming positive velocity is receding). \n\nThe observed peak wavelength for Star_1 is lambda1_obs = lambda1_peak*(1 + v1/c) \u2248 lambda1_peak*(1 + 0) = lambda1_peak. Since v1 is 0. \n\nFor Star_2, moving away at 700 km/s, the observed peak wavelength is lambda2_obs = lambda2_peak*(1 + v2/c). \n\nThe problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same, so lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs. \n\nTherefore, lambda1_peak = lambda2_peak*(1 + v2/c). \n\nBut since lambda_peak is proportional to 1/T (from Wien's law), so T is proportional to 1/lambda_peak. \n\nSo T1 / T2 = (lambda2_peak / lambda1_peak) \n\nBut since lambda1_peak = lambda2_peak*(1 + v2/c), substituting: \n\nT1 / T2 = (lambda2_peak) / [lambda2_peak*(1 + v2/c)] ) = 1/(1 + v2/c) \n\nSo T1 = T2/(1 + v2/c) \n\nHmm, so the actual temperatures of the stars are not the same. The observed peak is same, but intrinsic temperatures differ due to the Doppler shift. \n\nTherefore, I can't assume the temperatures are equal. The original assumption was wrong. \n\nTherefore, I need to account for this. Let me recalculate. \n\nLet me denote variables:\n\nLet\u2019s let v2 = 700 km/s. Since it's moving away, the Doppler factor is (1 + v/c). But c is the speed of light, which is about 3e5 km/s. \n\nSo v/c = 700 / 3e5 \u2248 0.002333. So 1 + v/c \u2248 1.002333. \n\nTherefore, the observed wavelength equality gives:\n\nlambda1_peak = lambda2_peak * (1 + v/c). \n\nHence, the ratio of the intrinsic peak wavelengths is lambda1_peak / lambda2_peak = 1 + v/c. \n\nSince lambda_peak is inversely proportional to temperature, then:\n\nT1 / T2 = (lambda2_peak / lambda1_peak) = 1/(1 + v/c). \n\nThus, T1 = T2/(1 + v/c). \n\nTherefore, the temperatures are not equal. \n\nNow, luminosity is L = 4\u03c0 R\u00b2 \u03c3 T\u2074. \n\nSo the ratio L1/L2 = (R1\u00b2/R2\u00b2) * (T1/T2)^4. \n\nWe know R1/R2 = 1.5, so R1\u00b2/R2\u00b2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. \n\nThe T ratio: (T1/T2)^4 = [1/(1 + v/c)]^4. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nL1/L2 = 2.25 * [1/(1 + v/c)]^4.",

Because if one is moving away, its observed \u03bb_max would be longer than its intrinsic. So for example, if Star_2 is moving away, then its intrinsic \u03bb_max would be shorter than the observed one. \n\nTherefore, the fact that the observed \u03bb_max are the same doesn't mean their intrinsic temperatures are equal.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is \u03bb_observed = \u03bb_emitted * sqrt((c + v)/(c - v)) when moving towards us, but perhaps for non-relativistic speeds, we can approximate it as \u03bb_observed = \u03bb_emitted (1 + v/c).",

The problem says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. The observed peak wavelength would be affected by the Doppler shift. Therefore, the intrinsic peak wavelengths (in their rest frames) might be different. So in order for the observed wavelengths to be same, their actual temperatures must differ.\n\nSo, let me think again. Let me consider the Doppler effect here. Let me recall that the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is: lambda_observed = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) for radial velocity v. But since the velocities are given in km/s, and c is about 3e5 km/s, the velocities here (700 km/s for Star_2 and 0 for Star_1) would lead to small shifts. But since we need to calculate the intrinsic temperatures, we have to reverse the Doppler shift.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nFor Star_1: since its radial velocity is 0, its observed lambda_max is equal to its intrinsic lambda_max1.\n\nFor Star_2: it's moving at 700 km/s. Assuming that the velocity is radial (since it's radial velocity), the observed wavelength would be shifted. Let me assume that 700 km/s is the speed away from us (since it's positive?), so it would be a redshift. Therefore, the observed lambda_obs_2 is longer than the intrinsic lambda_rest_2.\n\nBut the problem says the observed wavelengths (the ones they measured) are the same. So lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2 = lambda_obs.\n\nTherefore, the intrinsic lambdas must be different. Let me write the equations.\n\nLet me define:\n\nlambda_obs_1 = lambda_rest_1 (since v1=0)\n\nlambda_obs_2 = lambda_rest_2 * (1 + v/c) approximately, for small velocities (since v << c). The exact formula is (sqrt((1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c))) but for small v, it's approximately 1 + v/c.\n\nThe velocity v for Star_2 is 700 km/s. So v/c = 700e3 / 3e5 = 0.002333... So approximately 0.2333%. \n\nSo, since Star_2 is moving away (assuming positive velocity is away), the observed wavelength is longer. So:\n\nlambda_obs_2 = lambda_rest_2 * (1 + v/c)\n\nWe know that lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2 = lambda_obs\n\nTherefore, lambda_rest_1 = lambda_obs (since v1=0)\n\nlambda_rest_2 = lambda_obs / (1 + v/c)\n\nTherefore, the intrinsic peak wavelengths (lambda_rest) are different. Since Wien's law says lambda_max * T = b (constant), so T = b / lambda_max.\n\nTherefore, the temperatures are:\n\nT1 = b / lambda_rest_1 = b / lambda_obs\n\nT2 = b / lambda_rest_2 = b / [lambda_obs/(1 + v/c)] = b*(1 + v/c)/lambda_obs = T1*(1 + v/c)\n\nSo T2 = T1*(1 + v/c).",

So this is a key point I missed.\n\nAh! That changes everything. I need to adjust for the Doppler effect here. Because if the star is moving towards us or away, the observed peak wavelength is shifted. Since their observed \u03bb_max are the same, but their velocities are different, their actual temperatures could differ. So I need to correct for the Doppler shift first to find their actual temperatures.\n\nOkay, so let me redo this part. Let me denote:\n\nFor Star 1, which has radial velocity v1 = 0.

The key here is that even though the observed peak wavelengths are the same, the intrinsic ones (and thus temperatures) are different because of the Doppler shift. \n\nSo I need to compute the ratio of temperatures first. \n\nLet me redo the calculation with this in mind. \n\nLet me denote:\n\nFor Star 1: v1 = 0, so lambda_observed_1 = lambda_rest_1. \n\nFor Star 2: v2 = +700 km/s (assuming positive is away from us), so the observed wavelength is longer. \n\nGiven that the observed wavelengths are equal: \n\nlambda_observed_1 = lambda_observed_2 = L.\n\nThus, the intrinsic wavelength for Star 2 is:\n\nlambda_rest_2 = lambda_observed_2 / (1 + v/c) \u2248 L / (1 + 700e3/(3e5)) \n\nLet me compute v/c: 700,000 / 300,000,000 = 0.0023333.\n\nSo 1 + v/c \u2248 1.0023333.\n\nThus, lambda_rest_2 \u2248 L / 1.0023333 \u2248 L * (1 - 0.00233) (using binomial approximation for small v/c).\n\nThus, lambda_rest_2 \u2248 L * 0.9976667.\n\nNow, using Wien's law: lambda_max * T = constant (b).\n\nFor Star 1: T1 = b / lambda_rest_1 = b/L.\n\nFor Star 2: T2 = b / lambda_rest_2 \u2248 b/( L * 0.9976667 ) = (b/L) / 0.9976667 \u2248 T1 / 0.9976667 \u2248 T1 * 1.0023333.\n\nSo T2 \u2248 T1 * 1.0023333.\n\nTherefore, the temperature of Star 2 is slightly higher than Star 1. \n\nNow, compute the luminosity ratio. \n\nLuminosity is L = 4\u03c0 R\u00b2 \u03c3 T\u2074. \n\nThe ratio L1/L2 = (R1\u00b2 T1\u2074) / (R2\u00b2 T2\u2074)\n\nWe have R1/R2 = 1.5, so R1\u00b2/R2\u00b2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. \n\nThe temperature ratio T1/T2 is approx 1 / 1.0023333 \u2248 0.9976667.\n\nThus, (T1/T2)^4 \u2248 (0.9976667)^4. Let me calculate that. \n\nFirst, compute ln(0.9976667) \u2248 ln(1 -0.0023333) \u2248 -0.0023333 - (0.0023333)^2/2 \u2248 approx. Let me compute it numerically:\n\n0.9976667^4:\n\nLet me compute 0.9976667 squared first:\n\n0.9976667^2 = (0.9976667)*(0.9976667) \n\nLet me compute 1 - 0.0023333 squared:\n\n(1 - x)^2 \u2248 1 - 2x + x\u00b2, where x =0.0023333.\n\nso \u2248 1 - 2*(0.0023333) + (0.0023333)^2 \u2248 0.9953334 + 0.0000054 (approx) \u2192 ~0.9953388.",

So, the Doppler effect would shift their emitted peak wavelengths. Therefore, their actual temperatures (and thus their intrinsic \u03bb_max) would be different, but when observed, they have the same \u03bb_max. Therefore, we need to account for that shift to find their actual temperatures, which then affects their luminosities.\n\nOkay, let's break that down.

But the problem says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found them the same.

The Doppler effect would shift the observed wavelength. If the stars are moving, then the observed peak wavelength would be different from the actual peak. But the problem says that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So maybe the intrinsic peak wavelengths (before any Doppler shift) are different, but when adjusted for the velocity, they result in the same observed value. \n\nSo, let's clarify. Wien's Law gives the peak wavelength as lambda_peak = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. But if there's a Doppler shift, the observed wavelength lambda_obs is lambda_peak*(1 + v/c) for a receding velocity v. Since one is moving and the other isn't, their actual temperatures might be different, but after the Doppler shift, their observed peak wavelengths are the same. \n\nAh, that must be it! So I need to consider the Doppler effect here. \n\nLet me formalize this. Let\u2019s denote Star_1 has velocity v1 = 0, so no Doppler shift. Star_2 has velocity v2 = 700 km/s, which is moving away (assuming positive velocity is receding). \n\nThe observed peak wavelength for Star_1 is lambda1_obs = lambda1_peak*(1 + v1/c) \u2248 lambda1_peak*(1 + 0) = lambda1_peak. Since v1 is 0. \n\nFor Star_2, moving away at 700 km/s, the observed peak wavelength is lambda2_obs = lambda2_peak*(1 + v2/c). \n\nThe problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same, so lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs. \n\nTherefore, lambda1_peak = lambda2_peak*(1 + v2/c). \n\nBut since lambda_peak is proportional to 1/T (from Wien's law), so T is proportional to 1/lambda_peak. \n\nSo T1 / T2 = (lambda2_peak / lambda1_peak) \n\nBut since lambda1_peak = lambda2_peak*(1 + v2/c), substituting: \n\nT1 / T2 = (lambda2_peak) / [lambda2_peak*(1 + v2/c)] ) = 1/(1 + v2/c) \n\nSo T1 = T2/(1 + v2/c) \n\nHmm, so the actual temperatures of the stars are not the same. The observed peak is same, but intrinsic temperatures differ due to the Doppler shift. \n\nTherefore, I can't assume the temperatures are equal. The original assumption was wrong. \n\nTherefore, I need to account for this. Let me recalculate. \n\nLet me denote variables:\n\nLet\u2019s let v2 = 700 km/s. Since it's moving away, the Doppler factor is (1 + v/c). But c is the speed of light, which is about 3e5 km/s. \n\nSo v/c = 700 / 3e5 \u2248 0.002333. So 1 + v/c \u2248 1.002333. \n\nTherefore, the observed wavelength equality gives:\n\nlambda1_peak = lambda2_peak * (1 + v/c). \n\nHence, the ratio of the intrinsic peak wavelengths is lambda1_peak / lambda2_peak = 1 + v/c. \n\nSince lambda_peak is inversely proportional to temperature, then:\n\nT1 / T2 = (lambda2_peak / lambda1_peak) = 1/(1 + v/c). \n\nThus, T1 = T2/(1 + v/c). \n\nTherefore, the temperatures are not equal. \n\nNow, luminosity is L = 4\u03c0 R\u00b2 \u03c3 T\u2074. \n\nSo the ratio L1/L2 = (R1\u00b2/R2\u00b2) * (T1/T2)^4. \n\nWe know R1/R2 = 1.5, so R1\u00b2/R2\u00b2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. \n\nThe T ratio: (T1/T2)^4 = [1/(1 + v/c)]^4. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nL1/L2 = 2.25 * [1/(1 + v/c)]^4.",

Let me think again. Suppose Star_1 has no radial velocity (0 km/s), so its observed \u03bb_max is the same as its intrinsic. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Assuming that the velocity is towards us or away? The problem says \"radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively\".

The problem says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. The observed peak wavelength would be affected by the Doppler shift. Therefore, the intrinsic peak wavelengths (in their rest frames) might be different. So in order for the observed wavelengths to be same, their actual temperatures must differ.\n\nSo, let me think again. Let me consider the Doppler effect here. Let me recall that the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is: lambda_observed = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) for radial velocity v. But since the velocities are given in km/s, and c is about 3e5 km/s, the velocities here (700 km/s for Star_2 and 0 for Star_1) would lead to small shifts. But since we need to calculate the intrinsic temperatures, we have to reverse the Doppler shift.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nFor Star_1: since its radial velocity is 0, its observed lambda_max is equal to its intrinsic lambda_max1.\n\nFor Star_2: it's moving at 700 km/s. Assuming that the velocity is radial (since it's radial velocity), the observed wavelength would be shifted. Let me assume that 700 km/s is the speed away from us (since it's positive?), so it would be a redshift. Therefore, the observed lambda_obs_2 is longer than the intrinsic lambda_rest_2.\n\nBut the problem says the observed wavelengths (the ones they measured) are the same. So lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2 = lambda_obs.\n\nTherefore, the intrinsic lambdas must be different. Let me write the equations.\n\nLet me define:\n\nlambda_obs_1 = lambda_rest_1 (since v1=0)\n\nlambda_obs_2 = lambda_rest_2 * (1 + v/c) approximately, for small velocities (since v << c). The exact formula is (sqrt((1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c))) but for small v, it's approximately 1 + v/c.\n\nThe velocity v for Star_2 is 700 km/s. So v/c = 700e3 / 3e5 = 0.002333... So approximately 0.2333%. \n\nSo, since Star_2 is moving away (assuming positive velocity is away), the observed wavelength is longer. So:\n\nlambda_obs_2 = lambda_rest_2 * (1 + v/c)\n\nWe know that lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2 = lambda_obs\n\nTherefore, lambda_rest_1 = lambda_obs (since v1=0)\n\nlambda_rest_2 = lambda_obs / (1 + v/c)\n\nTherefore, the intrinsic peak wavelengths (lambda_rest) are different. Since Wien's law says lambda_max * T = b (constant), so T = b / lambda_max.\n\nTherefore, the temperatures are:\n\nT1 = b / lambda_rest_1 = b / lambda_obs\n\nT2 = b / lambda_rest_2 = b / [lambda_obs/(1 + v/c)] = b*(1 + v/c)/lambda_obs = T1*(1 + v/c)\n\nSo T2 = T1*(1 + v/c).",

So this is a key point I missed.\n\nAh! That changes everything. I need to adjust for the Doppler effect here. Because if the star is moving towards us or away, the observed peak wavelength is shifted. Since their observed \u03bb_max are the same, but their velocities are different, their actual temperatures could differ. So I need to correct for the Doppler shift first to find their actual temperatures.\n\nOkay, so let me redo this part. Let me denote:\n\nFor Star 1, which has radial velocity v1 = 0.

But the problem says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found them the same. So does that mean that the intrinsic temperatures (before Doppler shift) are the same, or the observed ones?\n\nHmm, that's a good question. Let me think. The Doppler effect would shift the observed wavelength. If the stars are moving, then the observed peak wavelength would be different from the actual peak. But the problem says that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So maybe the intrinsic peak wavelengths (before any Doppler shift) are different, but when adjusted for the velocity, they result in the same observed value. \n\nSo, let's clarify. Wien's Law gives the peak wavelength as lambda_peak = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. But if there's a Doppler shift, the observed wavelength lambda_obs is lambda_peak*(1 + v/c) for a receding velocity v. Since one is moving and the other isn't, their actual temperatures might be different, but after the Doppler shift, their observed peak wavelengths are the same. \n\nAh, that must be it! So I need to consider the Doppler effect here. \n\nLet me formalize this. Let\u2019s denote Star_1 has velocity v1 = 0, so no Doppler shift. Star_2 has velocity v2 = 700 km/s, which is moving away (assuming positive velocity is receding). \n\nThe observed peak wavelength for Star_1 is lambda1_obs = lambda1_peak*(1 + v1/c) \u2248 lambda1_peak*(1 + 0) = lambda1_peak. Since v1 is 0. \n\nFor Star_2, moving away at 700 km/s, the observed peak wavelength is lambda2_obs = lambda2_peak*(1 + v2/c). \n\nThe problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same, so lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs. \n\nTherefore, lambda1_peak = lambda2_peak*(1 + v2/c). \n\nBut since lambda_peak is proportional to 1/T (from Wien's law), so T is proportional to 1/lambda_peak. \n\nSo T1 / T2 = (lambda2_peak / lambda1_peak) \n\nBut since lambda1_peak = lambda2_peak*(1 + v2/c), substituting: \n\nT1 / T2 = (lambda2_peak) / [lambda2_peak*(1 + v2/c)] ) = 1/(1 + v2/c) \n\nSo T1 = T2/(1 + v2/c) \n\nHmm, so the actual temperatures of the stars are not the same. The observed peak is same, but intrinsic temperatures differ due to the Doppler shift. \n\nTherefore, I can't assume the temperatures are equal. The original assumption was wrong. \n\nTherefore, I need to account for this. Let me recalculate. \n\nLet me denote variables:\n\nLet\u2019s let v2 = 700 km/s. Since it's moving away, the Doppler factor is (1 + v/c). But c is the speed of light, which is about 3e5 km/s. \n\nSo v/c = 700 / 3e5 \u2248 0.002333. So 1 + v/c \u2248 1.002333. \n\nTherefore, the observed wavelength equality gives:\n\nlambda1_peak = lambda2_peak * (1 + v/c). \n\nHence, the ratio of the intrinsic peak wavelengths is lambda1_peak / lambda2_peak = 1 + v/c. \n\nSince lambda_peak is inversely proportional to temperature, then:\n\nT1 / T2 = (lambda2_peak / lambda1_peak) = 1/(1 + v/c). \n\nThus, T1 = T2/(1 + v/c). \n\nTherefore, the temperatures are not equal. \n\nNow, luminosity is L = 4\u03c0 R\u00b2 \u03c3 T\u2074. \n\nSo the ratio L1/L2 = (R1\u00b2/R2\u00b2) * (T1/T2)^4. \n\nWe know R1/R2 = 1.5, so R1\u00b2/R2\u00b2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. \n\nThe T ratio: (T1/T2)^4 = [1/(1 + v/c)]^4. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nL1/L2 = 2.25 * [1/(1 + v/c)]^4.",

Let me think again. The question states that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest (so observed \u03bb_max) are the same. But the actual \u03bb_max (intrinsic, without Doppler shift) would be different if the stars are moving.

          "text1": "Wait, that's a possibility I didn't consider before. Oh! That's probably where I went wrong.\n\nAh, right! The problem says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. The observed peak wavelength would be affected by the Doppler shift. Therefore, the intrinsic peak wavelengths (in their rest frames) might be different. So in order for the observed wavelengths to be same, their actual temperatures must differ.\n\nSo, let me think again. Let me consider the Doppler effect here. Let me recall that the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is: lambda_observed = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) for radial velocity v. But since the velocities are given in km/s, and c is about 3e5 km/s, the velocities here (700 km/s for Star_2 and 0 for Star_1) would lead to small shifts. But since we need to calculate the intrinsic temperatures, we have to reverse the Doppler shift.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nFor Star_1: since its radial velocity is 0, its observed lambda_max is equal to its intrinsic lambda_max1.\n\nFor Star_2: it's moving at 700 km/s. Assuming that the velocity is radial (since it's radial velocity), the observed wavelength would be shifted. Let me assume that 700 km/s is the speed away from us (since it's positive?), so it would be a redshift. Therefore, the observed lambda_obs_2 is longer than the intrinsic lambda_rest_2.\n\nBut the problem says the observed wavelengths (the ones they measured) are the same. So lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2 = lambda_obs.\n\nTherefore, the intrinsic lambdas must be different. Let me write the equations.\n\nLet me define:\n\nlambda_obs_1 = lambda_rest_1 (since v1=0)\n\nlambda_obs_2 = lambda_rest_2 * (1 + v/c) approximately, for small velocities (since v << c). The exact formula is (sqrt((1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c))) but for small v, it's approximately 1 + v/c.\n\nThe velocity v for Star_2 is 700 km/s. So v/c = 700e3 / 3e5 = 0.002333... So approximately 0.2333%. \n\nSo, since Star_2 is moving away (assuming positive velocity is away), the observed wavelength is longer. So:\n\nlambda_obs_2 = lambda_rest_2 * (1 + v/c)\n\nWe know that lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2 = lambda_obs\n\nTherefore, lambda_rest_1 = lambda_obs (since v1=0)\n\nlambda_rest_2 = lambda_obs / (1 + v/c)\n\nTherefore, the intrinsic peak wavelengths (lambda_rest) are different. Since Wien's law says lambda_max * T = b (constant), so T = b / lambda_max.\n\nTherefore, the temperatures are:\n\nT1 = b / lambda_rest_1 = b / lambda_obs\n\nT2 = b / lambda_rest_2 = b / [lambda_obs/(1 + v/c)] = b*(1 + v/c)/lambda_obs = T1*(1 + v/c)\n\nSo T2 = T1*(1 + v/c).",
          "text2": "Wait a minute. That's a crucial point. The problem says \"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same.\" So the observed wavelengths (\u03bb_obs) are the same. But the actual \u03bb_max (in their own rest frames) would be different if they have different radial velocities. Therefore, their actual temperatures might not be the same. So this is a key point I missed.\n\nAh! That changes everything. I need to adjust for the Doppler effect here. Because if the star is moving towards us or away, the observed peak wavelength is shifted. Since their observed \u03bb_max are the same, but their velocities are different, their actual temperatures could differ. So I need to correct for the Doppler shift first to find their actual temperatures.\n\nOkay, so let me redo this part. Let me denote:\n\nFor Star 1, which has radial velocity v1 = 0. So its observed \u03bb_max1_obs is the same as its rest frame \u03bb_max1_rest.\n\nStar 2 has radial velocity v2 = 700 km/s. Since it's moving away from us (assuming positive is away?), the observed wavelength would be longer than the rest frame. The formula for Doppler shift in wavelength is:\n\n\u03bb_obs = \u03bb_rest * sqrt( (c + v)/(c - v) )",
