          "text1": "Wait, the nucleosome histone complex is part of the chromatin structure itself. Since the assay is to recover the active chromatin proteome, the histones are part of the chromatin, but maybe they are not the proteins being immunoprecipitated unless the antibody is against the histones.",
          "text2": "Alternatively, the nucleosome might be part of the chromatin, so they would still be there. But maybe the question is considering that the nucleosome is a structural component and not part of the \"active\" factors, but the question says \"active chromatin\", which includes the nucleosomes in an open configuration. Since the histones are part of the chromatin, the immunoprecipitation would capture them. Unless the assay is using an antibody that's against a specific protein that's part of the active complex, but the question doesn't specify that. The wording says \"recover it by ChIP followed by mass spec\" so they are probably looking for all proteins bound to the active chromatin regions. So all proteins present there would be found. The pre-RC proteins are not present in transcriptionally active regions, so their proteins would be least observed. Hence the answer is B?",
