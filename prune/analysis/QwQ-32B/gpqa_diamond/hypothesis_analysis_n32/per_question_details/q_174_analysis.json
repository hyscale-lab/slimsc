          "text1": "Wait, but in the problem's rest frame, the initial nucleus is at rest, so after fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So their kinetic energies can be calculated based on that.\n\nLet me denote the two fragments as A (mass m1 = 2m2) and B (mass m2). Since momentum conservation requires their momenta to be equal in magnitude. So, p_A = -p_B. Let's call their magnitudes p.\n\nSo, the total kinetic energy is T1 (for fragment A) plus T2 (for fragment B) = 3 GeV (from the mass defect). \n\nBut how to find T1's actual value versus the classical value?\n\nFirst, let's do the classical calculation. In classical physics, kinetic energy is (p\u00b2)/(2m). Since their momenta are equal in magnitude, p_A = p_B = p. The kinetic energy of each would be (p\u00b2)/(2m1) and (p\u00b2)/(2m2) respectively. The total kinetic energy is (p\u00b2/(2m1)) + (p\u00b2/(2m2)) = (p\u00b2/2)(1/m1 + 1/m2).\n\nBut since m1=2m2, substitute:\n\nTotal classical KE = (p\u00b2/2)(1/(2m2) + 1/m2) = (p\u00b2/2)(3/(2m2)) )= (3 p\u00b2)/(4 m2).\n\nBut the total KE must be 3 GeV (from the mass defect).",

Let the mass of the smaller fragment be m, so the larger is 2m. Their total rest mass is m + 2m = 3m. The problem states that 3m = 0.99 M, so M = 3m /0.99. \n\nBut maybe I should consider the total energy. Since the nucleus was initially at rest, momentum must be conserved. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. So their velocities (momenta) must be such that p1 = -p2. \n\nSo the total momentum is zero, so the kinetic energy will depend on their velocities.

After fission, the total energy is the sum of the total energies of the two fragments. The total energy for each fragment is the sum of their rest mass energy and their kinetic energy. \n\nSo, initial energy: M c\u00b2.\n\nFinal energy: (m1 c\u00b2 + T1) + (m2 c\u00b2 + T2) = (m1 + m2)c\u00b2 + (T1 + T2) = 0.99 M c\u00b2 + (T1 + T2). \n\nSetting them equal: M c\u00b2 = 0.99 M c\u00b2 + (T1 + T2) \u2192 T1 + T2 = 0.01 M c\u00b2. \n\nThat 1% of the original mass is converted into kinetic energy, which makes sense. \n\nSince the nucleus was initially at rest, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, p1 = -p2. Therefore, the magnitudes are equal: |p1| = |p2|. Let me denote their magnitudes as p. \n\nSo, the momentum of fragment 1 is p and fragment 2 is -p. \n\nNow, the kinetic energy for each fragment depends on whether we use relativistic or classical mechanics. The problem asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical approximation. \n\nFirst, let's do the classical case. In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is (1/2)mv\u00b2. The momentum p is related to velocity by p = mv. \n\nSince the two fragments have opposite momenta, their velocities are in opposite directions, but the magnitudes of their momenta are equal. \n\nIn the classical case, T1 = (p^2)/(2m1), and T2 = (p^2)/(2m2). \n\nBecause the masses are different, their kinetic energies will be different. \n\nThe total kinetic energy is T1 + T2 = p\u00b2 (1/(2m1) + 1/(2m2)) ) = (p\u00b2/2)(1/m1 + 1/m2). \n\nBut we also know from conservation that T1 + T2 = 0.01 M c\u00b2. \n\nSo, in the classical case, to find T1, perhaps we can first find p, then compute T1.",
          "text2": "Wait, actually, the rest mass energy of the nucleus is 300 GeV, so M c\u00b2 = 300 GeV. So total energy before is 300 GeV. \n\nAfter fission, the total energy will be the sum of the rest masses plus their kinetic energies. So, the total energy is (m1 c\u00b2 + T1) + (m2 c\u00b2 + T2) = (m1 + m2)c\u00b2 + (T1 + T2). The problem states that m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Therefore, the total energy is 0.99 M c\u00b2 + (T1 + T2). \n\nBut conservation of energy requires that this equals the original energy, so 300 GeV (since M c\u00b2 is 300 GeV) equals 0.99 * 300 GeV + (T1 + T2). Therefore, the total kinetic energy T1 + T2 = 300 GeV - 0.99*300 GeV = 300*(1 - 0.99) = 300 *0.01 = 3 GeV. So the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV. \n\nNow, since momentum is conserved, and the initial momentum is zero, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p1 = -p2. Therefore, the magnitudes of their momenta are equal. Let's denote the magnitudes as p. \n\nSo, p1 = p and p2 = p (but opposite direction). \n\nNow, the kinetic energy in relativistic terms is T = (\u03b3 - 1) m c\u00b2, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. However, in the classical approximation, we would use T \u2248 p\u00b2/(2m). \n\nWe need to compute T1 (the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment) both relativistically and classically, then find the difference between the two. \n\nFirst, let's find the relativistic calculation. \n\nLet me denote the masses as m1 = 0.66M and m2 = 0.33M. \n\nSince p1 = p2 in magnitude.

So the lighter fragment is moving twice as fast as the heavier one? Hmm, that seems right because momentum conservation: if the mass is smaller, the velocity must be higher to have the same momentum. \n\nSo the kinetic energy of each fragment would depend on their mass and velocity. But here we need to calculate both the relativistic and classical kinetic energies and find the difference. \n\nFirst, let me note that the rest mass energy of the initial nucleus is 300 GeV. The sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 0.99*M. So the total rest mass energy of the fragments is 0.99*M * c\u00b2. Since the initial rest mass energy was M c\u00b2, the difference (which is 0.01*M c\u00b2) is the energy released, which would be converted into kinetic energy of the fragments and other forms.

We need to find the difference between the actual T1 (relativistic) and the classical approximation. \n\nHmm. To approach this, I think I should first compute the kinetic energy using both relativistic and classical methods and then find the difference. \n\nStarting with the classical approach. Let me think. In the classical case, conservation of momentum tells us that the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let's denote their velocities as v1 and v2. Since m2 is twice m1, then m2*v2 = -m1*v1. Let me write m1 as m, so m2 is 2m. Then, m*v1 = -2m*v2. So, v1 = -2v2.

Then S1 + S2 = 300.\n\nWe can square both sides:\n\n(S1 + S2)^2 = 300^2 \u2192 S1\u00b2 + 2 S1 S2 + S2\u00b2 = 90000.\n\nBut S1\u00b2 = 198\u00b2 + p\u00b2, and S2\u00b2 = 99\u00b2 + p\u00b2. So adding those gives 198\u00b2 + 99\u00b2 + 2 p\u00b2. Therefore,\n\n(198\u00b2 + 99\u00b2 + 2 p\u00b2 ) + 2 S1 S2 = 90000.\n\nLet me compute 198\u00b2 and 99\u00b2 first.\n\n198 squared: 198*198. Let me compute that. 200\u00b2 is 40000, subtract 2*200*2 + 2\u00b2 \u2192 (200-2)^2 = 200\u00b2 - 4*200 +4 \u2192 40000-800+4=39204. So 198\u00b2 = 39204.\n\n99 squared is 9801.\n\nSo 198\u00b2 + 99\u00b2 = 39204 + 9801 = 49005.\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n49005 + 2 p\u00b2 + 2 S1 S2 = 90000 \u2192 2 p\u00b2 + 2 S1 S2 = 90000 -49005 = 40995.\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\np\u00b2 + S1 S2 = 20497.5.\n\nHmm, but I need another equation to relate S1 and S2. Since S1 = 300 - S2 from the first equation, so substitute S1 = 300 - S2 into the equation above:\n\np\u00b2 + (300 - S2) * S2 = 20497.5.\n\nBut also, S2 = sqrt(99\u00b2 + p\u00b2). Let me write p\u00b2 = (S2)^2 - 99^2. Substitute that into the equation:\n\n( (S2)^2 - 99^2 ) + (300 S2 - (S2)^2 ) = 20497.5\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: (S2\u00b2 - 9801)\n\nSecond term: 300 S2 - S2\u00b2\n\nAdding them: (S2\u00b2 -9801) + (300 S2 - S2\u00b2) = 300 S2 - 9801 \n\nSo overall equation:\n\n300 S2 - 9801 = 20497.5 \u2192 300 S2 = 20497.5 + 9801 = 30298.5 \u2192 S2 = 30298.5 / 300 \u2248 100.995 GeV.",

Because m1 = 2 m2, so m1 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M \u2192 m2 = 0.33 M, so m1 = 0.66 M. \n\nTherefore, substituting into the equation:\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + (0.66 M)^2 ) + sqrt(p\u00b2 + (0.33 M)^2 ) = M \n\nWe need to solve for p here.

So the total energy released is 3 GeV (as I had before). \n\nNow, for the actual calculation, we need to use conservation of energy and momentum.

So T1 = (1/2)(2 m2)*(v2\u00b2 /4) = (1/2)*(2 m2)*(v2\u00b2)/4 = (m2 * v2\u00b2)/4.\n\nSimilarly, T2 = (1/2)m2*v2\u00b2. So T2 is twice T1. Therefore, the kinetic energies are in a ratio T1 : T2 = 1:2.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is T1 + T2 = 3*T1. But the total kinetic energy comes from the mass defect: 0.01*M*c\u00b2.

This might be a bit involved. Let me denote the two square roots as terms:\n\nLet\u2019s call S1 = sqrt(198\u00b2 + p\u00b2), S2 = sqrt(99\u00b2 + p\u00b2).

So adding those gives 198\u00b2 + 99\u00b2 + 2 p\u00b2. Therefore,\n\n(198\u00b2 + 99\u00b2 + 2 p\u00b2 ) + 2 S1 S2 = 90000.\n\nLet me compute 198\u00b2 and 99\u00b2 first.\n\n198 squared: 198*198. Let me compute that. 200\u00b2 is 40000, subtract 2*200*2 + 2\u00b2 \u2192 (200-2)^2 = 200\u00b2 - 4*200 +4 \u2192 40000-800+4=39204. So 198\u00b2 = 39204.\n\n99 squared is 9801.\n\nSo 198\u00b2 + 99\u00b2 = 39204 + 9801 = 49005.\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n49005 + 2 p\u00b2 + 2 S1 S2 = 90000 \u2192 2 p\u00b2 + 2 S1 S2 = 90000 -49005 = 40995.\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\np\u00b2 + S1 S2 = 20497.5.\n\nHmm, but I need another equation to relate S1 and S2. Since S1 = 300 - S2 from the first equation, so substitute S1 = 300 - S2 into the equation above:\n\np\u00b2 + (300 - S2) * S2 = 20497.5.\n\nBut also, S2 = sqrt(99\u00b2 + p\u00b2). Let me write p\u00b2 = (S2)^2 - 99^2. Substitute that into the equation:\n\n( (S2)^2 - 99^2 ) + (300 S2 - (S2)^2 ) = 20497.5\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: (S2\u00b2 - 9801)\n\nSecond term: 300 S2 - S2\u00b2\n\nAdding them: (S2\u00b2 -9801) + (300 S2 - S2\u00b2) = 300 S2 - 9801 \n\nSo overall equation:\n\n300 S2 - 9801 = 20497.5 \u2192 300 S2 = 20497.5 + 9801 = 30298.5 \u2192 S2 = 30298.5 / 300 \u2248 100.995 GeV.",

Because their momenta are equal and opposite.\n\nThe total energy after the decay is E1 + E2 = (m1c\u00b2 + T1) + (m2c\u00b2 + T2) = (m1 + m2)c\u00b2 + (T1 + T2). But the initial energy was Mc\u00b2. So, Mc\u00b2 = (0.99M)c\u00b2 + (T1 + T2), so T1 + T2 = 0.01Mc\u00b2 = 3 GeV, same as before.\n\nNow, in terms of four-momentum conservation:\n\nThe total momentum vectors must be zero, so the spatial components must cancel. So the magnitudes of the momenta must be equal.\n\nSo, sqrt(E1\u00b2 - (m1c\u00b2)^2) = sqrt(E2\u00b2 - (m2c\u00b2)^2 )\n\nLet me denote p as the magnitude of each momentum.

So we can do linear approximation between x=0.02 (sum 0.9909) and x=0.1 (sum 1.0124).

That's over 1.\n\nSo between x=0.06 (0.9981) and x=0.07 (1.001). Let's interpolate.\n\nWe need to reach 1.0 from 0.9981 to 1.001 over delta x 0.01. The amount needed is 1 -0.9981 =0.0019. \n\nThe difference between the two S values is 1.001-0.9981=0.0029 over delta x 0.01. \n\nSo fraction is 0.0019 /0.0029\u22480.655. So delta x is 0.655 *0.01\u22480.00655. So total x is 0.06 +0.00655\u22480.06655. \n\nSo approximate x \u22480.0666.

Here's the mistake. Earlier, I thought the kinetic energy was the difference between initial and final rest masses, but that's only in non-relativistic cases. \n\nActually, in relativity, the total energy is conserved. So the initial rest energy M c\u00b2 must equal the sum of the total energies (rest + kinetic) of the fragments. \n\nSo the total energy after is gamma1 m1 c\u00b2 + gamma2 m2 c\u00b2. \n\nThus, M c\u00b2 = gamma1 m1 c\u00b2 + gamma2 m2 c\u00b2 \n\nThe kinetic energy of the fragments is (gamma1 -1)m1 c\u00b2 + (gamma2 -1)m2 c\u00b2 \n\nWhich equals (gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2 - (m1 + m2))c\u00b2 \n\n= (gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2)c\u00b2 - (m1 + m2)c\u00b2 \n\nBut from the first equation, gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2 = M \n\nSo, the kinetic energy is M c\u00b2 - (m1 + m2)c\u00b2 = (M - (m1 + m2))c\u00b2 = (0.01 M)c\u00b2 =3 GeV, which matches the previous calculation. \n\nBut the problem is that in my earlier analysis, I assumed that gamma1 = gamma2, but that leads to a contradiction in the velocity relations. \n\nHmm, so perhaps there is an error in the assumption that gamma1 = gamma2? Let me see.",
          "text2": "Wait, but the total is 3 GeV, so the other fragment (mass m) has 2 GeV? Because m*(2v2)^2 /2 = (m *4 v2\u00b2)/2 = 2 m v2\u00b2. Which is 2*(1 GeV) = 2 GeV. So yes. \n\nSo in the classical case, T1 (the 2m fragment's KE) is 1 GeV. \n\nNow, let's compute the relativistic case. \n\nIn the relativistic case, the total energy is 300 GeV (initial rest energy). The rest energy of the fragments is 297 GeV, so the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV as before. \n\nWe need to find the kinetic energy of the 2m fragment (T1) in the relativistic case, then subtract the classical value (1 GeV) to find the difference. \n\nSo let's set up equations again. \n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1. 99 gamma1 + 198 gamma2 = 300 [since each fragment's energy is gamma * rest mass energy, so 99 gamma1 (for the m fragment) and 198 gamma2 (for the 2m fragment). The sum is 300 GeV. ]\n\n2. gamma1 v1 = 2 gamma2 v2 [from momentum conservation, magnitudes equal]\n\nAlso, note that the fragments are moving in opposite directions, so their velocities are in opposite directions, but we can just consider magnitudes here. \n\nWe need to relate these variables. Let's see if we can express beta1 and beta2 in terms of each other. \n\nLet me denote beta1 = v1/c, beta2 = v2/c. Then, equation 2 becomes:\n\ngamma1 beta1 = 2 gamma2 beta2.\n\nHmm, but this seems a bit complex. Maybe we can find a relation between gamma1 and gamma2. Let me see.\n\nAlso, note that the kinetic energy of fragment1 is (gamma1 -1)*99 GeV, fragment2 is (gamma2 -1)*198 GeV. The sum of these is 3 GeV. \n\nSo (gamma1 -1)*99 + (gamma2 -1)*198 = 3. \n\nLet me write that as 99 gamma1 + 198 gamma2 - (99 + 198) = 3 \n\nBut from equation 1, 99 gamma1 + 198 gamma2 = 300. \n\nSo substituting equation 1 into the above gives:\n\n300 - (297) = 3 \u2192 3 =3, which checks out.

Then, equation 2 becomes:\n\ngamma1 beta1 = 2 gamma2 beta2.\n\nHmm, but this seems a bit complex. Maybe we can find a relation between gamma1 and gamma2. Let me see.\n\nAlso, note that the kinetic energy of fragment1 is (gamma1 -1)*99 GeV, fragment2 is (gamma2 -1)*198 GeV. The sum of these is 3 GeV. \n\nSo (gamma1 -1)*99 + (gamma2 -1)*198 = 3. \n\nLet me write that as 99 gamma1 + 198 gamma2 - (99 + 198) = 3 \n\nBut from equation 1, 99 gamma1 + 198 gamma2 = 300. \n\nSo substituting equation 1 into the above gives:\n\n300 - (297) = 3 \u2192 3 =3, which checks out.

The problem states that 3m = 0.99 M, so M = 3m /0.99. \n\nBut maybe I should consider the total energy. Since the nucleus was initially at rest, momentum must be conserved. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. So their velocities (momenta) must be such that p1 = -p2. \n\nSo the total momentum is zero, so the kinetic energy will depend on their velocities. Since they have different masses, their kinetic energies won't be the same. \n\nLet me think in terms of classical physics first. \n\nIn classical physics, the kinetic energy is (p\u00b2)/(2m) for each fragment. Since their momenta are equal in magnitude (p1 = -p2), so p = p1 = p2 (in magnitude). \n\nLet me denote the mass of the smaller fragment as m, so the larger is 2m. \n\nTotal kinetic energy (T1 + T2) is equal to the mass defect energy, which is 0.01*M*c\u00b2. Since the initial rest mass energy was 300 GeV, so 0.01 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV. So T1 + T2 = 3 GeV. \n\nBut in classical terms, since their momenta are equal, the kinetic energy of the smaller fragment would be (p\u00b2)/(2m), and the larger would be (p\u00b2)/(4m). The ratio is 2:1. So T2 (smaller) is twice T1 (larger)?",

After fission, the total energy is the sum of the total energies of the two fragments. The total energy for each fragment is the sum of their rest mass energy and their kinetic energy. \n\nSo, initial energy: M c\u00b2.\n\nFinal energy: (m1 c\u00b2 + T1) + (m2 c\u00b2 + T2) = (m1 + m2)c\u00b2 + (T1 + T2) = 0.99 M c\u00b2 + (T1 + T2). \n\nSetting them equal: M c\u00b2 = 0.99 M c\u00b2 + (T1 + T2) \u2192 T1 + T2 = 0.01 M c\u00b2. \n\nThat 1% of the original mass is converted into kinetic energy, which makes sense. \n\nSince the nucleus was initially at rest, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

The problem asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical approximation. \n\nFirst, let's do the classical case. In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is (1/2)mv\u00b2. The momentum p is related to velocity by p = mv. \n\nSince the two fragments have opposite momenta, their velocities are in opposite directions, but the magnitudes of their momenta are equal. \n\nIn the classical case, T1 = (p^2)/(2m1), and T2 = (p^2)/(2m2). \n\nBecause the masses are different, their kinetic energies will be different. \n\nThe total kinetic energy is T1 + T2 = p\u00b2 (1/(2m1) + 1/(2m2)) ) = (p\u00b2/2)(1/m1 + 1/m2). \n\nBut we also know from conservation that T1 + T2 = 0.01 M c\u00b2. \n\nSo, in the classical case, to find T1, perhaps we can first find p, then compute T1.",

So, the total energy is (m1 c\u00b2 + T1) + (m2 c\u00b2 + T2) = (m1 + m2)c\u00b2 + (T1 + T2). The problem states that m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Therefore, the total energy is 0.99 M c\u00b2 + (T1 + T2). \n\nBut conservation of energy requires that this equals the original energy, so 300 GeV (since M c\u00b2 is 300 GeV) equals 0.99 * 300 GeV + (T1 + T2). Therefore, the total kinetic energy T1 + T2 = 300 GeV - 0.99*300 GeV = 300*(1 - 0.99) = 300 *0.01 = 3 GeV. So the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV. \n\nNow, since momentum is conserved, and the initial momentum is zero, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So yes. \n\nSo in the classical case, T1 (the 2m fragment's KE) is 1 GeV. \n\nNow, let's compute the relativistic case. \n\nIn the relativistic case, the total energy is 300 GeV (initial rest energy).

The sum of these is 3 GeV. \n\nSo (gamma1 -1)*99 + (gamma2 -1)*198 = 3. \n\nLet me write that as 99 gamma1 + 198 gamma2 - (99 + 198) = 3 \n\nBut from equation 1, 99 gamma1 + 198 gamma2 = 300. \n\nSo substituting equation 1 into the above gives:\n\n300 - (297) = 3 \u2192 3 =3, which checks out.

So, momentum conservation gives m v1 = (2m) v2 \u2192 v2 = v1 / 2. So the velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. \n\nNow, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (the 2m one) is T1 in the relativistic case, and we need to compare it with the classical calculation.\n\nFirst, let's do the classical case. The total kinetic energy comes from the rest mass energy difference. The original rest mass energy is M c\u00b2 (since rest-mass energy is 300 GeV, so M c\u00b2 = 300 GeV). The sum of the fragments' rest masses is 0.99 M, so their total rest mass energy is 0.99 M c\u00b2. The difference is 0.01 M c\u00b2, which is the energy released, which becomes kinetic energy. \n\nSo, total kinetic energy (classical) is 0.01 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV.

Since their masses are m and 2m, and their velocities are in opposite directions with magnitudes related by v2 = v1/2 (from momentum conservation). \n\nIn classical physics, kinetic energy is (1/2)mv\u00b2.

Since momentum is conserved, the momentum of fragment 1 (mass 2m) must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the momentum of fragment 2 (mass m). So, 2m * v1 = - m * v2. Therefore, v2 = -2 v1. The velocities are in opposite directions.\n\nNow, the kinetic energy of each fragment will depend on their velocities, but since we are to compare the relativistic and classical calculations, I need to compute both.\n\nFirst, let's consider the classical case. In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is (1/2)mv\u00b2. Let me denote the kinetic energies as T1 (for the heavier fragment, 2m) and T2 (for the lighter, m). \n\nIn the classical case, since momentum is conserved, as above, 2m v1 = m v2 \u2192 v2 = 2 v1. Then, the kinetic energies would be T1 = (1/2)(2m)(v1)^2 = m v1\u00b2, and T2 = (1/2)m (2v1)^2 = 2 m v1\u00b2. So, T2 = 2 T1. So the kinetic energy of the lighter fragment is twice that of the heavier one in classical.\n\nBut the total kinetic energy in the classical case would be T1 + T2 = 3 T1.

So the velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. \n\nNow, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (the 2m one) is T1 in the relativistic case, and we need to compare it with the classical calculation.\n\nFirst, let's do the classical case. The total kinetic energy comes from the rest mass energy difference. The original rest mass energy is M c\u00b2 (since rest-mass energy is 300 GeV, so M c\u00b2 = 300 GeV). The sum of the fragments' rest masses is 0.99 M, so their total rest mass energy is 0.99 M c\u00b2.

Since momentum is conserved, the momentum of fragment 1 (mass 2m) must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the momentum of fragment 2 (mass m). So, 2m * v1 = - m * v2. Therefore, v2 = -2 v1. The velocities are in opposite directions.\n\nNow, the kinetic energy of each fragment will depend on their velocities, but since we are to compare the relativistic and classical calculations, I need to compute both.\n\nFirst, let's consider the classical case.

So first, I need to find T1 relativistically, then find the classical T1, then subtract.\n\nLet me note that the problem says \"sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M\". So rest mass energy of fragments is 0.99*M c\u00b2. The rest is kinetic energy? Or is that the total energy?",
