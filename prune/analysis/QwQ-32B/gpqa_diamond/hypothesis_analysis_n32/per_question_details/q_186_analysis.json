The Cope rearrangement would move the double bond three positions. Let's say towards the nitrogen. The double bond would move from 5-6 to 2-3. The hydride from carbon 3 would move to carbon 6.

The numbering in the options would have the pyridine part as a six-membered ring. \n\nAssuming this, the product would have the double bond in the pyridine ring between positions 2 and 3.
