So the structure would be something like:\n\nPh-CH2-NH2 attached to another position (say, para), and the aldehyde is on another carbon. For example, let's say the benzene ring has:\n\n- Aldehyde group at position 1 (O=CH-Ph)\n\n- A -CH2NH2 group at position 4.\n\nThen the molecular formula would be:\n\n6 (benzene) + 2 (CH2NH2) + 1 (aldehyde's CH) \u2192 but wait, the aldehyde's carbon is part of the benzene ring? No, benzaldehyde is Ph-CHO, so the aldehyde is on the benzene's carbon. So adding a -CH2NH2 group would give:\n\nTotal carbons: benzene (6) + the CH2 in the -CH2NH2 \u2192 8 carbons. Yes! So the molecular formula matches: C8H9NO. \n\nNow, the NMR of this compound would have:\n\n- The aldehyde at around 9.7 (as given).\n\n- The CH2NH2 group's CH2 would be next to the NH2, so its chemical shift would be around 3.6 (the 3.66 ppm doublet). The NH2 would be a broad singlet (the 6.27 ppm peak). \n\nThe aromatic protons would be on the benzene ring. The substitution pattern would be: aldehyde at position 1, and the -CH2NH2 at position 4. The other positions (2,3,5,6) would have protons. \n\nThe peaks at 6.98 and 6.51 would be the aromatic protons. Let's see:\n\nThe aldehyde at position 1 would cause the adjacent protons (positions 2 and 6) to be deshielded. However, the -CH2NH2 at position 4 would also affect the chemical shifts. The protons at positions 3 and 5 would be further away from both substituents, so their chemical shifts might be different. \n\nThe doublets at 6.98 and 6.51 could be due to the splitting from the neighboring groups. The exact positions might require more detailed analysis, but this structure seems plausible.\n\nNow, the reaction steps:\n\n1. NaNO2 + HCl \u2192 diazotization of the aromatic amino group (the NH2 on the benzene ring). Since the amino is directly on the benzene ring (position 4 in this example), it can form a diazonium salt.\n\n2. H2O might just be water, but the next step is KOH and heat. \n\n3. Aqueous KOH, heat: this would likely hydrolyze the diazonium salt. The diazonium salt (Ar-N2+Cl-) in basic conditions would undergo hydrolysis to form a phenoxide ion and release N2. \n\nSo the phenoxide would be Ph-O- (since the original amino was on the ring). The phenoxide would then be protonated by the water to form a phenol. \n\nSo the -NH2 group on the benzene ring becomes -OH. The rest of the molecule remains. \n\nIn our example structure, the original compound had:\n\n- Aldehyde at position 1 (Ph-CHO)\n\n- CH2-NH2 at position 4\n\nAfter reaction, the NH2 at position 4 becomes -OH.

The protons at positions 3 and 5 would be further away from both substituents, so their chemical shifts might be different. \n\nThe doublets at 6.98 and 6.51 could be due to the splitting from the neighboring groups.

NaNO2 + HCl \u2192 diazotization of the aromatic amino group (the NH2 on the benzene ring).

Aqueous KOH, heat: this would likely hydrolyze the diazonium salt. The diazonium salt (Ar-N2+Cl-) in basic conditions would undergo hydrolysis to form a phenoxide ion and release N2. \n\nSo the phenoxide would be Ph-O- (since the original amino was on the ring). The phenoxide would then be protonated by the water to form a phenol. \n\nSo the -NH2 group on the benzene ring becomes -OH. The rest of the molecule remains. \n\nIn our example structure, the original compound had:\n\n- Aldehyde at position 1 (Ph-CHO)\n\n- CH2-NH2 at position 4\n\nAfter reaction, the NH2 at position 4 becomes -OH.

Let me re-calculate the O's:\n\nIf the molecular formula is C8H9NO, then the O comes from the aldehyde (CHO) and any other O's must be accounted for. \n\nIf the NMR shows a broad singlet for 2H at 6.27, which could be two OH groups, then that would require two O's. But the formula has only one O. So that's impossible. \n\nAh! Here's the mistake. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. The O is only one. So the two OH groups can't exist because that would require two O's. Therefore, the 6.27 peak must be something else. \n\nSo the 6.27 (bs, 2H) is not OH. What else could it be?\n\nMaybe an NH2 group. Amines can show up as broad singlets. NH2 is two protons, so that fits. \n\nSo the molecule has an amino group (NH2), an aldehyde (CHO), and the rest is aromatic. \n\nThe molecular formula gives O=1 (aldehyde), N=1 (amino), so that's correct. \n\nSo the NMR peaks: \n\nThe 9.72 (t,1H) is the aldehyde proton. \n\nThe 6.98 and 6.51 are the aromatic protons (two sets of 2H each, doublets). \n\nThe 3.66 (d, 2H) is the CH2 group adjacent to the aldehyde. \n\nThe 6.27 (bs, 2H) is the NH2 group. \n\nTherefore, the original compound is a benzene ring with substituents:\n\n- An amino group (NH2) causing the 6.27 peak,\n\n- A CH2-CHO group (the aldehyde part),\n\nand the aromatic peaks are from the remaining protons on the benzene ring. \n\nThe positions of the substituents need to be such that the aromatic protons are split into two doublets. \n\nAssuming the substituents are in the 1,3 positions (meta), the aromatic peaks would be different. \n\nNow, proceeding to the reaction steps:\n\n1. Diazotization of the amino group (NH2 \u2192 diazonium salt). \n\n2. Hydrolysis with H2O \u2192 the amino group is replaced by an -OH group. \n\n3.

Let's see: Aldehyde is one double bond (C=O), so remaining 4. \n\nLooking at the NMR data, the aldehyde is there (the 9.72 ppm), then the aromatic protons. The aromatic regions suggest that there's a benzene ring. Let me try to think of a possible structure. \n\nThe 3.66 ppm signal is a CH2 group. Since it's a doublet, maybe it's adjacent to a CH group.

So substituting, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (16+2=18; 18-9=9; +1=10)/2 =5. So yes, 5. \n\nAn aldehyde (CHO) contributes one double bond (the carbonyl). If the structure has a benzene ring (6-membered aromatic, so 4 degrees). Then maybe another double bond. Let's see: benzene (4) + carbonyl (1) =5. So that adds up.

So the structure would be something like:\n\nPh-CH2-NH2 attached to another position (say, para), and the aldehyde is on another carbon. For example, let's say the benzene ring has:\n\n- Aldehyde group at position 1 (O=CH-Ph)\n\n- A -CH2NH2 group at position 4.\n\nThen the molecular formula would be:\n\n6 (benzene) + 2 (CH2NH2) + 1 (aldehyde's CH) \u2192 but wait, the aldehyde's carbon is part of the benzene ring? No, benzaldehyde is Ph-CHO, so the aldehyde is on the benzene's carbon. So adding a -CH2NH2 group would give:\n\nTotal carbons: benzene (6) + the CH2 in the -CH2NH2 \u2192 8 carbons. Yes! So the molecular formula matches: C8H9NO. \n\nNow, the NMR of this compound would have:\n\n- The aldehyde at around 9.7 (as given).\n\n- The CH2NH2 group's CH2 would be next to the NH2, so its chemical shift would be around 3.6 (the 3.66 ppm doublet). The NH2 would be a broad singlet (the 6.27 ppm peak). \n\nThe aromatic protons would be on the benzene ring. The substitution pattern would be: aldehyde at position 1, and the -CH2NH2 at position 4. The other positions (2,3,5,6) would have protons. \n\nThe peaks at 6.98 and 6.51 would be the aromatic protons. Let's see:\n\nThe aldehyde at position 1 would cause the adjacent protons (positions 2 and 6) to be deshielded. However, the -CH2NH2 at position 4 would also affect the chemical shifts. The protons at positions 3 and 5 would be further away from both substituents, so their chemical shifts might be different. \n\nThe doublets at 6.98 and 6.51 could be due to the splitting from the neighboring groups. The exact positions might require more detailed analysis, but this structure seems plausible.\n\nNow, the reaction steps:\n\n1. NaNO2 + HCl \u2192 diazotization of the aromatic amino group (the NH2 on the benzene ring). Since the amino is directly on the benzene ring (position 4 in this example), it can form a diazonium salt.\n\n2. H2O might just be water, but the next step is KOH and heat. \n\n3. Aqueous KOH, heat: this would likely hydrolyze the diazonium salt. The diazonium salt (Ar-N2+Cl-) in basic conditions would undergo hydrolysis to form a phenoxide ion and release N2. \n\nSo the phenoxide would be Ph-O- (since the original amino was on the ring). The phenoxide would then be protonated by the water to form a phenol. \n\nSo the -NH2 group on the benzene ring becomes -OH. The rest of the molecule remains. \n\nIn our example structure, the original compound had:\n\n- Aldehyde at position 1 (Ph-CHO)\n\n- CH2-NH2 at position 4\n\nAfter reaction, the NH2 at position 4 becomes -OH. The CH2 remains. \n\nSo the product would be:\n\nPh-CHO (aldehyde at 1) with a -CH2-OH at position 4. Additionally, the other groups remain.",

That works. \n\nSo structure: benzene ring with an NH2 group and a CH2-CHO substituent. Let me see the NMR:\n\nThe aldehyde at 9.72 ppm. The CH2 would be adjacent to the carbonyl (CHO), so maybe the CH2 is at 3.66 ppm (doublet because of coupling with the adjacent CH2 or other protons).
