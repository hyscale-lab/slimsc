          "text1": "Wait, no: each OH is O and H, so three OH groups would have 3 O and 3 H. So total molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is Fe (55.85) + 3*(O + H) \u2192 3*(16+1)=51. So yes, total is 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol. \n\nSo moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol. Let me calculate that. Let me do this division. 0.1 divided by 106.85. Hmm. Let me approximate. Maybe 106.85 is approximately 107. So 0.1 / 107 \u2248 0.0009346 mol. Let me do it more accurately. 106.85 \u00d7 0.0009346 is 0.1, but perhaps I should compute it directly. 0.1 divided by 106.85 equals approximately 0.000936 moles. Let me check with calculator steps:\n\n0.1 / 106.85 = (1 / 1068.5) \u2248 0.000936 mol. So approximately 9.36 \u00d710^-4 mol of Fe(OH)3.\n\nSince the reaction requires 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3, the moles of H+ needed would be 3 \u00d7 9.36e-4 \u2248 0.002808 mol.\n\nThe acid is 0.1 M, so the volume required would be moles divided by concentration. So volume (L) = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L. Convert to cm\u00b3, which is mL, so 28.08 cm\u00b3. Hmm, so that would be around 28.08 cm\u00b3.

          "text2": "Wait, wait, I think I messed up the calculation. Let me recalculate. \n\nFe: 55.85, O: 3*(16) from the three OH groups (since each OH has one O?), no, wait Fe(OH)3 has three hydroxide ions each with an O and H. So the formula is Fe(OH)3, so the molar mass is Fe (55.85) plus 3*(O=16 + H=1) \u2192 each OH is 17, so 3*17=51. So 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol. Okay, so 0.1 grams divided by 106.85 g/mol gives moles of Fe(OH)3. Let me compute that: 0.1 /106.85 \u2248 0.000936 moles? Let me check with a calculator: 0.1 divided by 106.85. 106.85 is approx 107, so 0.1/107 \u2248 0.0009346 mol. Let's keep more decimals: 0.1/106.85 = 0.000936 (since 106.85*0.000936 is 0.1). So moles of Fe(OH)3 is ~0.000936 mol.\n\nNow, since the reaction requires 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3, the moles of H+ needed would be 3 * 0.000936 \u2248 0.002808 mol. \n\nThe acid is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration.

But maybe the Fe(OH)3 is considered as solid initially, so the acid is in some volume, and then after reaction, the total volume is 100. Or is the acid's volume the only one considered except the Fe(OH)3? Hmm, perhaps the question is just asking for the minimal volume of acid needed, assuming that the total volume of solution (acid plus water) is 100 cm\u00b3. So the acid must be mixed into a total volume of 100 cm\u00b3. Therefore, the acid's volume plus the volume of water added should equal 100. But maybe the question is simpler: the acid is the only solvent? Hmm, maybe the way to think is that the acid is added to the Fe(OH)3, and then the total solution is diluted to 100 cm\u00b3. But the question says \"dissolve 0.1g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm\u00b3 total volume\". So the total solution must be 100 cm\u00b3. Therefore, the acid's volume is part of that total. But the question asks for the minimal volume of acid needed. To minimize the acid volume, you need to provide just enough to neutralize the Fe(OH)3, and then add water to reach 100 cm\u00b3. So the acid volume is the minimum required to neutralize the Fe(OH)3, and the rest is water.

The Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is approximately 2.79\u00d710^-39. \n\nThe solubility product expression is Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

The total volume is 100 cm\u00b3. \n\nSo [Fe^3+] = 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L = ~0.009356 M. \n\nThe hydrolysis of Fe^3+ is a weak acid, so we can model it using the formula for a weak acid. Let me denote the concentration of Fe^3+ as C = 0.009356 M. \n\nThe hydrolysis produces H+ ions. The equilibrium for the first hydrolysis step is: \n\nFe^3+ + H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)^2+ + H+ \n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction (Ka1) can be calculated from the Ksp and the solubility product.",
          "text2": "Wait, if you add exactly the amount to neutralize the OH- of Fe(OH)3, then all the H+ is consumed. But then the solution would have Fe\u00b3+ and water. But Fe\u00b3+ is a Lewis acid, so maybe it hydrolyzes in water to produce H+?\n\nAh, right! Even after neutralization, the Fe\u00b3+ ions can hydrolyze, releasing H+ and thus lowering the pH. So the pH is not from the excess acid, but from the hydrolysis of Fe\u00b3+.\n\nHmm, so that's an important point. So the problem is not about excess H+ from the acid, but about the hydrolysis of Fe\u00b3+ in solution.\n\nTherefore, after neutralization, the solution is Fe\u00b3+ in water, which hydrolyzes like this:\n\nFe\u00b3+ + H2O \u2194 Fe(OH)\u00b3+ + H+.\n\nSo the pH will depend on the concentration of Fe\u00b3+ and the hydrolysis constant.\n\nTherefore, to calculate the pH, I need to find the concentration of H+ from the hydrolysis of Fe\u00b3+.\n\nSo first, let's find the concentration of Fe\u00b3+ in the solution. Since we have 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm\u00b3 total volume, the moles of Fe\u00b3+ would be the same as the moles of Fe(OH)3, which is 0.0009357 mol (from before). The concentration is moles/volume (in liters). \n\nVolume is 0.1 L, so concentration is 0.0009357 / 0.1 L = 0.009357 M. So approximately 0.00936 M Fe\u00b3+.\n\nNow, the hydrolysis of Fe\u00b3+ is a weak acid. The equilibrium is Fe\u00b3+ + H2O \u2194 H3O+ + Fe(OH)\u00b2+.\n\nThe Ka for this reaction can be found from the Kb of Fe(OH)3. Since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, its Kb is related to the Ka of its conjugate acid.",

Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the moles of H+ needed: 3 * moles Fe(OH)3. As before, 0.000936 *3 = 0.002808 mol H+.\n\nThe acid's volume needed is 0.002808 mol / 0.1 M = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm\u00b3. So that's about 28.08 cm\u00b3. Looking at the options, option C has 28.05 cm\u00b3 and pH 2.04. Option B has 30.09 cm\u00b3 and pH 2.69. Hmm. The difference could be due to rounding in the molar mass. Let me recalculate the molar mass precisely.\n\nFe: 55.845 g/mol, O: 16.00, H: 1.008.\n\nFe(OH)3: 55.845 + 3*(16.00 + 1.008) = 55.845 + 3*(17.008) = 55.845 + 51.024 = 106.869 g/mol.\n\nSo 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol = 0.1 / 106.869 \u2248 0.0009356 mol Fe(OH)3. Multiply by 3 gives 0.0028068 mol H+.\n\nSo volume is 0.0028068 / 0.1 = 0.028068 L = 28.068 cm\u00b3, which rounds to 28.07 cm\u00b3. The options have 28.05 (C) and 28.05 is close. Maybe they used approximate molar masses. Let's proceed.\n\nNow, for the pH. After reaction, all Fe(OH)3 is converted to Fe^3+.

Hmm, perhaps the question is just asking for the minimal volume of acid needed, assuming that the total volume of solution (acid plus water) is 100 cm\u00b3. So the acid must be mixed into a total volume of 100 cm\u00b3. Therefore, the acid's volume plus the volume of water added should equal 100. But maybe the question is simpler: the acid is the only solvent? Hmm, maybe the way to think is that the acid is added to the Fe(OH)3, and then the total solution is diluted to 100 cm\u00b3. But the question says \"dissolve 0.1g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm\u00b3 total volume\". So the total solution must be 100 cm\u00b3. Therefore, the acid's volume is part of that total.

The formula is Fe(OH)3, so molar mass Fe is 55.845, O is 16.00, H is 1.008. So:\n\nFe: 55.845\n\nEach OH is 17.008 (16 + 1.008). So three OH groups: 3*17.008 = 51.024\n\nTotal molar mass is 55.845 + 51.024 = 106.869 g/mol\n\nSo moles Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 / 106.869 \u2248 0.0009357 mol.

The question says \"the resulting solution\" after adding the acid and dissolving Fe(OH)3. The pH depends on the excess H+ or other ions. Let's think.\n\nAfter adding exactly the amount of acid needed (28.07 cm3), the H+ would just neutralize all the OH- from Fe(OH)3, but Fe^3+ would be in solution. However, Fe^3+ is a Lewis acid and will hydrolyze in water, producing H+ ions. So even if the acid is exactly stoichiometric, the Fe^3+ will create an acidic solution.

Adding to Fe: 55.85 +51.021 = 106.87 g/mol. So 0.1 g divided by 106.87 gives 0.0009356 mol. That's correct.\n\nSo 3 times that gives 0.0028068 moles H+.

But that's okay.\n\nNow the next part is the pH of the solution. The question is, what's the pH after adding the acid?

But if the solution's pH is controlled by the excess H+ beyond that, but perhaps if you add exactly the required amount, then the solution would be neutral? But since the Fe^3+ is a Lewis acid, it hydrolyzes in water. So Fe^3+ + 3H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)3 + 3H+. This hydrolysis would contribute H+ ions, making the solution acidic. Therefore, the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.\n\nSo maybe the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate moles of Fe(OH)3 \u2192 0.1g / molar mass \u2192 ~9.36e-4 mol.\n\n2. To dissolve it, need to add H+ to convert it to Fe^3+ and water. So the required H+ is 3*(moles of Fe(OH)3) \u2192 2.808e-3 mol H+.\n\n3. The acid is monobasic (e.g., HCl), so each mole of acid gives 1 mole H+. So volume needed is (2.808e-3 mol) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm\u00b3. So that's about 28.08 cm\u00b3, which matches option C's volume (28.05 cm\u00b3). Close enough considering rounding.\n\nBut then the pH is determined by the Fe^3+ hydrolysis. Let's compute that.\n\nThe Fe^3+ concentration in solution would be equal to the moles of Fe(OH)3, since each Fe(OH)3 gives one Fe^3+. So moles of Fe^3+ is 9.36e-4 mol in 0.1 L (100 cm\u00b3), so concentration is 9.36e-4 / 0.1 = 0.00936 M.\n\nNow, the hydrolysis reaction is Fe^3+ + 3H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+.",

To dissolve it, the acid (let's say HCl) reacts with it:\n\nFe(OH)3 + 3HCl \u2192 FeCl3 + 3H2O\n\nSo, the HCl provides the H+ needed. The moles of HCl needed would be 3 times moles of Fe(OH)3, which we calculated as ~28.07 cm\u00b3 of 0.1M acid (since 0.1M * 0.02807 L = 0.002807 mol H+).\n\nBut once dissolved, the solution contains Fe^3+ ions and Cl^- ions. The Fe^3+ is a Lewis acid and can hydrolyze in water:\n\nFe^3+ + H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)^2+ + H+\n\nSo this hydrolysis would release H+ into the solution, contributing to a lower pH.\n\nThus, the pH is not just from the excess H+ but also from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.\n\nHmm, so perhaps we have to consider that?\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol \u2248 0.0009356 mol.\n\nSo moles of H+ needed: 3 \u00d7 0.0009356 = 0.002807 mol. Divided by 0.1 M gives 28.07 cm\u00b3. So that's the volume of acid needed, which matches option C's 28.05 cm\u00b3 (maybe rounded differently).\n\nNow, the pH calculation. After the reaction, the solution contains Fe^3+ and Cl^- ions. The Cl^- is a spectator ion (from strong acid, so it doesn't hydrolyze). The Fe^3+ will hydrolyze to produce H+.\n\nThe concentration of Fe^3+ is (0.0009356 mol) / 0.1 L = 0.009356 M. Let's denote that as 9.356e-3 M.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is:\n\nFe^3+ + H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)^2+ + H+ \n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for Fe^3+.",
          "text2": "Wait, maybe I should redo the calculations with more precise numbers.\n\nLet me recalculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 precisely. 0.1 grams divided by molar mass. The formula is Fe(OH)3, so molar mass Fe is 55.845, O is 16.00, H is 1.008. So:\n\nFe: 55.845\n\nEach OH is 17.008 (16 + 1.008). So three OH groups: 3*17.008 = 51.024\n\nTotal molar mass is 55.845 + 51.024 = 106.869 g/mol\n\nSo moles Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 / 106.869 \u2248 0.0009357 mol. Exactly, 0.1 divided by 106.869.\n\nSo moles of H+ required: 3 * 0.0009357 \u2248 0.002807 moles.\n\nThe acid is 0.1 M, so volume needed is 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 liters, which is 28.07 cm\u00b3. So that's about 28.05 cm3 (option C) or 28.07, which is close to C's 28.05. Maybe the slight difference is from rounding.\n\nNow, what's the pH of the solution? The question says \"the resulting solution\" after adding the acid and dissolving Fe(OH)3. The pH depends on the excess H+ or other ions. Let's think.\n\nAfter adding exactly the amount of acid needed (28.07 cm3), the H+ would just neutralize all the OH- from Fe(OH)3, but Fe^3+ would be in solution. However, Fe^3+ is a Lewis acid and will hydrolyze in water, producing H+ ions. So even if the acid is exactly stoichiometric, the Fe^3+ will create an acidic solution.

Let's see, if that's the case, then:\n\n[OH-]^3 = Ksp / [Fe\u00b3+] \n\nSo [OH-] = ( (2.79e-39) / (0.009357) )^(1/3)\n\nCalculating that:\n\nFirst, compute Ksp divided by [Fe\u00b3+]:\n\n2.79e-39 / 0.009357 \u2248 (2.79 / 9.357) * 1e-36 \u2248 (0.298) * 1e-36 = 2.98e-37\n\nThen take the cube root: (2.98e-37)^(1/3) \n\nCube root of 2.98 is about 1.43 (since 1.4^3 is 2.744, 1.43^3 \u2248 2.924). \n\nCube root of 1e-37 is 1e-12.333 approximately?",
          "text2": "Wait, let me think again. The solubility product Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is [Fe^3+][OH-]^3. So Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH-]^3.\n\nRearranged, [OH-]^3 = Ksp / [Fe^3+]\n\nTherefore, [OH-] = (Ksp/[Fe^3+])^(1/3)\n\nBut the pH is determined by the H+ concentration, so:\n\n[OH-] = (Ksp/( [Fe^3+] ))^(1/3)\n\nThen [H+] = Kw / [OH-] = Kw / ( (Ksp/[Fe^3+])^(1/3) )\n\nBut this might be getting too complicated. Let's plug in the numbers.\n\nAssuming Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is 2.79\u00d710^-39 (I think this is a standard value). Let me confirm that. Yes, I believe that's correct.\n\nSo Ksp = 2.79e-39.\n\n[Fe^3+] is 0.009357 M.\n\nSo [OH-]^3 = (2.79e-39) / (0.009357)\n\nCalculating that:\n\nFirst, denominator is ~0.009357 = 9.357e-3.\n\nSo 2.79e-39 / 9.357e-3 \u2248 (2.79 /9.357) * 1e-36 \u2248 0.298 *1e-36 = 2.98e-37.\n\nTherefore, [OH-]^3 = 2.98e-37 \u2192 [OH-] = (2.98e-37)^(1/3).\n\nCube root of 2.98e-37. Let's see, cube root of 1e-36 is 1e-12, so cube root of 2.98e-37 is cube root(2.98) * 1e-12.333?",

But in that case, if you add exactly the stoichiometric amount, then there's no excess, so the pH would be determined by the water autoionization. But that's pH 7, which isn't any of the options. So that can't be right.\n\nHmm, maybe I made an error in the calculation of the moles. Let me recalculate the molar mass of Fe(OH)3 again to be sure. Fe is about 55.85 g/mol. Each OH group is 17 g/mol (16 +1). So three OH groups: 3\u00d717=51. So total molar mass is 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol. Yes.

Let me see if using 55.85 for Fe and 16 for O and 1 for H gives 106.85, then 0.1/106.85=0.0009357, which gives same as before. So perhaps the options have it as 28.05, so that's probably correct.

To dissolve it, we need to add 3 mol H+ per mol Fe(OH)3. \n\nThe acid is 0.1 M, so the volume required is (3 * 0.0009356) / 0.1 = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm\u00b3, so that's the volume. \n\nNow, after the reaction, all the H+ from the acid (0.002807 mol) is consumed in dissolving the Fe(OH)3, so there's no excess H+ from the acid. However, the Fe^3+ ions in solution will hydrolyze, producing H+. \n\nThe hydrolysis reaction of Fe^3+ is: \n\nFe^3+ + H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)^2+ + H+ \n\nThis would contribute H+ to the solution, so the solution's pH is determined by this hydrolysis. \n\nTherefore, to find the pH, we need to calculate the H+ concentration from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+. \n\nThe concentration of Fe^3+ in solution is moles/volume.

To keep Fe(OH)3 dissolved, the product [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 must be less than or equal to Ksp. \n\nSo, after adding the acid, the solution's pH is such that the OH- concentration is low enough to prevent precipitation. The Fe^3+ concentration would be the amount we have, so 0.0009357 moles in 0.1 L \u2192 0.009357 M. \n\nSo setting up the equation:\n\nKsp = (0.009357) * [OH^-]^3 \u2192 [OH^-]^3 = Ksp / 0.009357 \u2248 (2.79e-39)/(0.009357) \u2248 3e-37 \u2192 [OH^-] \u2248 cube root of 3e-37 \u2192 approx 3^(1/3)*1e-12.333.

So that can't be right.\n\nHmm, maybe I made an error in the calculation of the moles. Let me recalculate the molar mass of Fe(OH)3 again to be sure. Fe is about 55.85 g/mol. Each OH group is 17 g/mol (16 +1). So three OH groups: 3\u00d717=51. So total molar mass is 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol. Yes.

To dissolve it, we need to add 3 mol H+ per mol Fe(OH)3. \n\nThe acid is 0.1 M, so the volume required is (3 * 0.0009356) / 0.1 = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm\u00b3, so that's the volume. \n\nNow, after the reaction, all the H+ from the acid (0.002807 mol) is consumed in dissolving the Fe(OH)3, so there's no excess H+ from the acid. However, the Fe^3+ ions in solution will hydrolyze, producing H+. \n\nThe hydrolysis reaction of Fe^3+ is: \n\nFe^3+ + H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)^2+ + H+ \n\nThis would contribute H+ to the solution, so the solution's pH is determined by this hydrolysis. \n\nTherefore, to find the pH, we need to calculate the H+ concentration from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+. \n\nThe concentration of Fe^3+ in solution is moles/volume.

Since we have 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm\u00b3 total volume, the moles of Fe\u00b3+ would be the same as the moles of Fe(OH)3, which is 0.0009357 mol (from before).

Since we have 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm\u00b3 total volume, the moles of Fe\u00b3+ would be the same as the moles of Fe(OH)3, which is 0.0009357 mol (from before).

So the solution will contain Fe^3+ ions in water, which hydrolyze to produce H+ ions. So the pH is determined by the Fe^3+ hydrolysis.\n\nSo to find the pH, we need to calculate the concentration of H+ from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.\n\nFirst, let's find the concentration of Fe^3+ in the solution. The amount of Fe^3+ is equal to the moles of Fe(OH)3 dissolved. So moles Fe^3+ = 0.0009358 mol (same as moles of Fe(OH)3). The total volume is 100 cm\u00b3, which is 0.1 L.

So moles of acid needed = moles of H+ needed, which is 3*(moles Fe(OH)3). \n\nSo the volume is correct as 28.07 cm\u00b3, which is option C's first value. \n\nNow, for the pH: if the acid is exactly stoichiometric, then all H+ is consumed, and the solution contains Fe\u00b3+ and water. The Fe\u00b3+ will hydrolyze to produce H+:\n\nFe\u00b3+ + H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)\u00b2+ + H+ \n\nThe concentration of Fe\u00b3+ is 0.009357 M (0.0009357 mol / 0.1 L).\n\nThe hydrolysis will produce H+ ions. Let's denote the concentration of H+ as x. The hydrolysis can be approximated as:\n\nFe\u00b3+ (aq) \u21cc Fe(OH)\u00b2+ (aq) + H+ \n\nThe equilibrium expression is:\n\nKa = [Fe(OH)\u00b2+][H+] / [Fe\u00b3+] \n\nBut since the solution is very dilute in terms of the metal ion, we can approximate the change.

So the volume is ~28.07 cm3, which matches option C's 28.05 cm3 (probably due to rounding in molar masses or Ksp).\n\nNow, the pH calculation. Since all the acid's H+ was used up in neutralizing the OH-, the solution now has Fe^3+ and the conjugate base (A-) from the acid, but A- is a spectator ion (since the acid is strong, its conjugate base is very weak). Thus, the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.\n\nThe Fe^3+ concentration is 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009356 M.\n\nThe hydrolysis produces H+:\n\nFe^3+ + H2O \u21cc H+ + Fe(OH)^2+\n\nThe equilibrium expression for this is Ka = [H+][Fe(OH)^2+] / [Fe^3+]\n\nBut the K for this reaction (Ka) can be related to the Ksp of Fe(OH)3.",

To dissolve it, the acid (let's say HCl) reacts with it:\n\nFe(OH)3 + 3HCl \u2192 FeCl3 + 3H2O\n\nSo, the HCl provides the H+ needed. The moles of HCl needed would be 3 times moles of Fe(OH)3, which we calculated as ~28.07 cm\u00b3 of 0.1M acid (since 0.1M * 0.02807 L = 0.002807 mol H+).\n\nBut once dissolved, the solution contains Fe^3+ ions and Cl^- ions. The Fe^3+ is a Lewis acid and can hydrolyze in water:\n\nFe^3+ + H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)^2+ + H+\n\nSo this hydrolysis would release H+ into the solution, contributing to a lower pH.\n\nThus, the pH is not just from the excess H+ but also from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.\n\nHmm, so perhaps we have to consider that?\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol \u2248 0.0009356 mol.\n\nSo moles of H+ needed: 3 \u00d7 0.0009356 = 0.002807 mol. Divided by 0.1 M gives 28.07 cm\u00b3. So that's the volume of acid needed, which matches option C's 28.05 cm\u00b3 (maybe rounded differently).\n\nNow, the pH calculation. After the reaction, the solution contains Fe^3+ and Cl^- ions. The Cl^- is a spectator ion (from strong acid, so it doesn't hydrolyze). The Fe^3+ will hydrolyze to produce H+.\n\nThe concentration of Fe^3+ is (0.0009356 mol) / 0.1 L = 0.009356 M. Let's denote that as 9.356e-3 M.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is:\n\nFe^3+ + H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)^2+ + H+ \n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for Fe^3+.",
          "text2": "Wait, maybe I should redo the calculations with more precise numbers.\n\nLet me recalculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 precisely. 0.1 grams divided by molar mass. The formula is Fe(OH)3, so molar mass Fe is 55.845, O is 16.00, H is 1.008. So:\n\nFe: 55.845\n\nEach OH is 17.008 (16 + 1.008). So three OH groups: 3*17.008 = 51.024\n\nTotal molar mass is 55.845 + 51.024 = 106.869 g/mol\n\nSo moles Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 / 106.869 \u2248 0.0009357 mol. Exactly, 0.1 divided by 106.869.\n\nSo moles of H+ required: 3 * 0.0009357 \u2248 0.002807 moles.\n\nThe acid is 0.1 M, so volume needed is 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 liters, which is 28.07 cm\u00b3. So that's about 28.05 cm3 (option C) or 28.07, which is close to C's 28.05. Maybe the slight difference is from rounding.\n\nNow, what's the pH of the solution? The question says \"the resulting solution\" after adding the acid and dissolving Fe(OH)3. The pH depends on the excess H+ or other ions. Let's think.\n\nAfter adding exactly the amount of acid needed (28.07 cm3), the H+ would just neutralize all the OH- from Fe(OH)3, but Fe^3+ would be in solution. However, Fe^3+ is a Lewis acid and will hydrolyze in water, producing H+ ions. So even if the acid is exactly stoichiometric, the Fe^3+ will create an acidic solution.

But for the pH calculation, the total volume is 100 cm\u00b3, so the concentration of Fe^3+ would be based on 100 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo first, the moles of Fe^3+ is equal to the moles of Fe(OH)3, because each Fe(OH)3 gives one Fe^3+ when dissolved.

So the acid's volume must be less than or equal to 100 cm\u00b3, but the minimal volume required for the reaction plus any excess (but minimal is just enough, so the rest is water). Hmm. Maybe the way to think is that the acid is added in the minimal volume (exactly the needed H+ moles) to dissolve the Fe(OH)3, then the total solution volume is 100 cm\u00b3. Therefore, the H+ is stoichiometric, so no excess H+ from the acid, so the pH is due to Fe^3+ hydrolysis.\n\nSo to calculate the pH, we need to find the concentration of Fe^3+ in the solution and then compute the pH from its hydrolysis.\n\nFirst, let's compute the concentration of Fe^3+.\n\nThe moles of Fe^3+ are equal to the moles of Fe(OH)3, which is 0.000936 mol (from earlier calculation).
