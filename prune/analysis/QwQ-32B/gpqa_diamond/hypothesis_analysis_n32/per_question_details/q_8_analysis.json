Hmm, but the double mutants with G2 knocked out (g1g2 and g2g3) are zero, same as g2. So perhaps when G2 is present, G1 and G3 are redundant? Let me think again.\n\nThe key here is that the double mutants involving G2 (like g1g2) have the same phenotype as g2. That suggests that G2's absence is epistatic over G1 and G3. In other words, G2 is required for the function of G1 and G3. So if G2 is not there, even if G1 and/or G3 are present, they can't contribute to resistance. Therefore, G2 is acting upstream, possibly as a transcription factor that regulates G1 and G3. \n\nLooking at the options, the question states that at least one is a transcription factor upstream of others.

Let's see:\n\nIf G2 is a transcription factor, then the absence of G2 (g2) would mean that both G1 and G3 are not expressed. But in the g2 mutant, resistance is 0%, so the plant can't resist. \n\nBut in the g1 mutant, the resistance is 75%, so losing G1 alone doesn't knock it down to zero. So perhaps G2 is regulating G1 and G3 such that even without G1, G3 can still contribute. Because g1 has 75% (so maybe G3 is still active?), but when G2 is knocked out (g2), then both G1 and G3 are not expressed, leading to 0% resistance. \n\nSo if G2 is a transcription factor for both G1 and G3, then the double mutant g2g3 would have G2 knocked out (so G1 isn't expressed) and G3 is also knocked out. But in that case, since G2's absence already blocks G1's expression, removing G3 doesn't make it worse. So that's why the g2g3 is same as g2. \n\nSimilarly, the g1g2 mutant (G1 and G2 knocked out) would have the same as g2, since G2's knockout is already causing the loss of G1's expression. \n\nNow the key here is that G1 and G3 might be redundant. Because when you knock out G1, you still have G3, but the resistance is 75% (so maybe each contributes 25%?), but when you knock out both G1 and G3 (g1g3), the resistance drops to 10% (so 75-25=50?",

But also, when G2 is knocked out, the plant has 0% regardless of the state of G1 or G3 (since g2g3 and g1g2 are also 0%). That suggests that G2 is necessary for resistance. If G2 is a transcription factor, maybe it's required to turn on other genes (like G1 and G3) which contribute to resistance. \n\nNow, looking at the single mutants: \n\ng1 has 75% resistance. So without G1, resistance is still 75, meaning that other genes (like G2 and G3) are still active. Since G2 is present, maybe G2 is upregulating other genes. \n\ng3 has 50% resistance, so losing G3 reduces it further, but not all the way. \n\nBut when you knock out both G1 and G3 (g1g3), the resistance drops to 10%. That's a big drop from either single mutant. This suggests that G1 and G3 are acting in parallel pathways. If they are redundant, then their combined loss would have an additive effect. But redundancy usually means that having both is redundant, so knocking out one doesn't affect much, but both do. But here, each single mutant already has some effect.",

Since G2 is out, G3 isn't expressed (since G2 is needed to activate it). So G3 is off, and G1 is also off. So that's the same as g2 (since G3 is not expressed), so resistance is 0%. Which matches the data. \n\n- g2g3: G2 is out (so G3 isn't expressed even if the gene is present?), but G3 is knocked out. So same as g2, so 0%. \n\n- g1g3: Both G1 and G3 are knocked out.

So if G2 is missing, G3 isn't expressed, so knocking it out doesn't add anything. \n\nSimilarly, g1g2 is 0% same as g2. So G1's presence or absence doesn't matter when G2 is knocked out. So G1 is also regulated by G2. \n\nNow, for the g1g3 double mutant, since both are knocked out but G2 is present, then G2 is still active. So G2 is producing its product, which normally activates G1 and G3. But in the g1g3 double, both of those are missing. So their loss would remove the downstream effectors. So their combined loss would lead to a worse phenotype than either alone. Which aligns with the data (g1's 75%, g3's 50%, together 10%). \n\nSo this suggests that G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, and their products are necessary for resistance. Since losing both gives a worse result than either alone, they might have some redundancy. \n\nSo G2 is a transcription factor (since it's upstream), and G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways (so redundant).

G3 is epistatic over G1. Hmm, same promoter would mean they share a regulatory region, but not sure how that affects the resistance. The epistasis here: G3 epistatic to G1. So if the double mutant g1g3's resistance is worse than either single, but in this case, g1g3 has 10%, which is worse than both (since g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%). So that's worse. If G3 is epistatic to G1, then the double mutant would have the phenotype of G3's knockout. But here, the double's resistance is even lower than g3's 50%. So that might not fit. Unless the epistasis is in another way. Not sure yet.\n\nOption C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. G1 is epistatic over G3. Pleiotropy means a gene affecting multiple traits, but here the question is about resistance. Not sure how that plays in. If G1 is epistatic over G3, then the double mutant g1g3 would have the same as g1. But the actual data is 10%, which is worse than g1's 75%, so that's not the case. So maybe this is incorrect.\n\nOption D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic over G3. Redundancy would mean that they have overlapping functions. So when both are knocked out, the effect is more severe. Which matches the g1g3 case (10% vs their single mutants 75 and 50). So redundancy makes sense here. \n\nNow, the question is about which combination is correct. \n\nLet me think again step by step. Since the g2 mutant has 0% resistance, which is the worst, that suggests that G2 is a critical gene. If G2 is a transcription factor (as in options B, C, D), that might make sense. Because if G2 is a TF that regulates other genes (like G1 or G3), then knocking out G2 would block their expression. \n\nSuppose G2 is a TF that directly regulates both G1 and G3. Then, in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3's expressions would be downregulated.

Pleiotropy refers to a gene affecting multiple traits, but here the question is about their interactions in the resistance pathway.

So A might not be right.\n\nOption B: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, and G3 is epistatic over G1. Hmm, same promoter might mean they are regulated similarly, but I'm not sure. The epistatic part: G3 being epistatic over G1 would mean that G3's presence can mask G1's effect.

If G2 is the transcription factor, then without G2, all others can't be expressed, which explains the 0% in g2. The pleiotropy would mean each of G1 and G3 have multiple effects.

Redundancy would mean that G1 and G3 have overlapping functions, so losing one reduces resistance, but losing both reduces it more. Looking at the data, the single mutants: g1 (75%) and g3 (50%).

Let me re-express the possible relationships. \n\nIf G2 is a transcription factor for G1 and G3, then:\n\n- g2: no G2, so G1 and G3 can't be expressed, leading to 0% resistance (matches data).\n\n- g1: G2 is present, so G3 is still expressed. Since G1 is knocked out, but G3 can still contribute. The resistance is 75%, which is better than 0, so G3 contributes some resistance. \n\n- g3: similarly, G1 is present, so some resistance remains (50% vs 75% for g1). This suggests that G1 might have a stronger effect than G3. \n\nNow, in the double mutant g1g3 (both missing but G2 present), neither G1 nor G3 is expressed, so the only resistance would come from other genes (but the question's context says these are the candidates, so maybe those are the main ones). So without either, their combined loss gives even less resistance (10%), which is worse than either single. \n\nThis indicates that G1 and G3 are partially redundant. Their functions are overlapping such that losing both leads to a more severe phenotype. So that's redundancy. \n\nNow, looking at the options again, option D says \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\". Epistatic here would mean that G1's mutation covers up G3's effect. But in the g1g3 case, the combined effect is worse than either alone, which would contradict epistasis. Because if G1 is epistatic over G3, then the double mutant should look like the g1 single. But it's worse, so that's not the case.",
