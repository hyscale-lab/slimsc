If the substituent is in the para position, the remaining protons might be split into doublets, but perhaps the splitting here comes from coupling with adjacent protons.

The adjacent CH2 would be connected to the terminal CH2-CH3. \n\nHmm, perhaps the NMR signals:\n\nThe terminal methyl (CH2-CH3) would give the 0.9 ppm triplet (the CH3) and the adjacent CH2 would be a quartet (but in the data, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet of 2H, which might be that CH2). The central CH (the one with the branch) is the 2.9 ppm signal. The methyl branch is the 1.4 ppm doublet. \n\nSo this would fit a sec-butyl group. \n\nTherefore, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring. And the other substituent is the carboxylic acid group. \n\nNow, the benzene ring has two substituents: the carboxylic acid and the sec-butyl group. Their positions must be determined. \n\nLooking at the aromatic NMR peaks: 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). The two doublets suggest that the substituents are in the para positions. Because if they were meta, the peaks would be more complex, but two doublets could mean that the substituents are para. \n\nSo, the benzene ring has the carboxylic acid (say at position 1) and the sec-butyl group at position 4. This would give the aromatic signals as two doublets, each with two protons, because the remaining protons are on the other sides of the ring. \n\nSo the structure would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is \"4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\".",
          "text2": "Wait, the total H's from aromatic part would be 6 minus substituents. If there are two substituents (carboxylic acid and another group), then four H's left. So that matches the NMR's 2+2.\n\nSo, the benzene ring has two substituents: the COOH (which is a para to the other substituent maybe?), and an alkyl group.\n\nNow the alkyl chain. Let's look at the NMR peaks for the alkyl groups:\n\nThe 0.9 ppm triplet (t, 3H) is a methyl group at the end of a chain (since triplet implies it's attached to a CH2 which is connected to another CH2 or something). The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH (since the doublet comes from coupling with a neighboring CH). The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 next to a branching point, and 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a CH that's part of a branch.\n\nPutting this together, the alkyl chain structure would be something like a sec-butyl group. Let's see:\n\nA sec-butyl group has the structure CH(CH3)CH2CH3.",

The doublets suggest that the aromatic protons are split into two sets of two protons each. This is typical for a para-disubstituted benzene. For example, if the substituents are in positions 1 and 4. The carboxylic acid is in position 1, and another substituent (alkyl) in position 4. The 8.0 and 7.2 could then be the two sets of protons. So the benzene ring has substituents in para positions.\n\nNow the substituent in position 4 must be an alkyl group. The substituent's NMR peaks are the aliphatic ones.\n\nLooking at the aliphatic peaks:\n\nThe 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): this could be a methine group (CH) in a branch. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): maybe a methylene adjacent to the branch. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl group attached to a CH (so doublet). The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): terminal methyl.\n\nPutting this together, the substituent chain might be like this:\n\nStarting from the benzene ring (position 4), the substituent is a chain that goes through a branch. Let's see:\n\nLet me consider the substituent as a sec-butyl group. The structure would be:\n\n- The benzene is connected to a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that might be a longer chain.",

The 1.7 ppm is another multiplet, maybe another methylene. The 1.4 ppm is a doublet (d, 3H), which is a methyl group attached to a carbon that's next to a CH2 (since the coupling constant would be around 7 Hz, typical for a CH2-CH3). The 0.9 ppm triplet (t, 3H) is probably a terminal methyl group (like in an ethyl group, but the triplet suggests it's the end of a chain).\n\nPutting this together: The NMR suggests a structure with a benzene ring (from the aromatic protons), a carboxylic acid group (from the 10.5 ppm peak), and an alkyl chain attached to the benzene. Let's count the carbons from the NMR peaks. The aromatic protons are 2H each at 8.0 and 7.2, so total 4H on the benzene. The remaining protons are:\n\n1H from the OH (but that's a singlet, already accounted for).\n\nThen the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a CH connected to a branch. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) might be a CH2 between two branches or part of a chain. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH (since the coupling is a doublet, maybe from a CH2-CH group?), and the 0.9 triplet (3H) is a CH2-CH3. So the chain part might be something like CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-... but let me think step by step.\n\nBreaking down the NMR peaks:\n\nThe alkyl chain parts:\n\n- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): this is probably a methyl group at the end of an ethyl group (the triplet suggests a CH2CH3, but the triplet is from the CH2 attached to another CH2 or CH3).",

The doublets suggest that the aromatic protons are split into two sets of two protons each. This is typical for a para-disubstituted benzene. For example, if the substituents are in positions 1 and 4. The carboxylic acid is in position 1, and another substituent (alkyl) in position 4. The 8.0 and 7.2 could then be the two sets of protons. So the benzene ring has substituents in para positions.\n\nNow the substituent in position 4 must be an alkyl group. The substituent's NMR peaks are the aliphatic ones.\n\nLooking at the aliphatic peaks:\n\nThe 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): this could be a methine group (CH) in a branch. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): maybe a methylene adjacent to the branch. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl group attached to a CH (so doublet). The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): terminal methyl.\n\nPutting this together, the substituent chain might be like this:\n\nStarting from the benzene ring (position 4), the substituent is a chain that goes through a branch. Let's see:\n\nLet me consider the substituent as a sec-butyl group. The structure would be:\n\n- The benzene is connected to a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that might be a longer chain.",

The 1.4 ppm is a doublet (d, 3H), which is a methyl group attached to a carbon that's next to a CH2 (since the coupling constant would be around 7 Hz, typical for a CH2-CH3). The 0.9 ppm triplet (t, 3H) is probably a terminal methyl group (like in an ethyl group, but the triplet suggests it's the end of a chain).\n\nPutting this together: The NMR suggests a structure with a benzene ring (from the aromatic protons), a carboxylic acid group (from the 10.5 ppm peak), and an alkyl chain attached to the benzene. Let's count the carbons from the NMR peaks. The aromatic protons are 2H each at 8.0 and 7.2, so total 4H on the benzene. The remaining protons are:\n\n1H from the OH (but that's a singlet, already accounted for).\n\nThen the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a CH connected to a branch. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) might be a CH2 between two branches or part of a chain. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH (since the coupling is a doublet, maybe from a CH2-CH group?), and the 0.9 triplet (3H) is a CH2-CH3.

The 4-ethylphenyl group attached to a propanoic acid. Let's see.\n\nOption B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's an aromatic compound with isobutyl and methyl groups, but no carboxylic acid.\n\nOption D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Again, an aromatic without acid.\n\nGiven the IR has the carboxylic acid peaks (1720 and broad O-H), so the starting compound (X) must have a carboxylic acid. Therefore, the correct options are A or C, because B and D don't have a carboxylic acid.\n\nSo between A and C.\n\nNow, let's look at the NMR data again. The carboxylic acid's proton is at 10.5 ppm, which is typical for benzoic acid (aromatic carboxylic acids have their -COOH proton around 10-12 ppm due to hydrogen bonding).\n\nThe aromatic peaks are at 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). That suggests that the substituents on the benzene ring cause these peaks. Let's see:\n\nIn option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The structure is a benzene ring with a COOH group and a sec-butyl group on the para position (since it's 4-). The substituents would be in the para positions, so the aromatic protons would be in the ortho and meta positions relative to the substituents.",
          "text2": "Wait, the name of the compound would have the substituents listed in order. The carboxylic acid is the functional group, so the numbering would prioritize the COOH group as position 1. So the sec-butyl would be on position 4. Therefore, the structure would be:\n\nBenzene ring with -COOH at position 1, and a sec-butyl group at position 4. That would give two sets of aromatic protons: the ones adjacent to the COOH (which would be deshielded, so higher ppm) and the ones adjacent to the sec-butyl. The 8.0 and 7.2 ppm peaks would correspond to those.\n\nNow, let's look at the other options. Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That would be a propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group attached at position 2. The NMR would have the ethyl group (CH2CH2CH3?), but that might not fit the given peaks. Option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, which is a benzene with isobutyl and methyl groups, but that's an alkane, so the IR wouldn't have the 1720 cm-1 peak (since it's an alkane, not a carboxylic acid). Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, again an alkane, so no carboxylic acid. The presence of the 10.5 ppm OH peak suggests a carboxylic acid, which is in options A and C.\n\nSo between A and C. Let's see the NMR of option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The alkyl chain would be a sec-butyl. The NMR of sec-butyl would have a terminal methyl (triplet at ~0.9), a methylene (multiplet at ~1.7?), a methyl attached to a branch (doublet at 1.4?), and the methine (the branching point) as a singlet or multiplet. That matches the given NMR peaks. \n\nIn option A, the structure is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Let's see: The ethyl group is on the 4-position of a phenyl group, which is attached via a propyl chain to a carboxylic acid. The NMR would have an ethyl group (CH2CH3), so a triplet at ~1 ppm for the CH2 and a triplet at ~0.9 for the CH3. Also, the propyl chain would have more methylene groups. The given NMR has a 1.4 ppm doublet (3H), which would be a methyl group, but in option A's case, the ethyl group's methyl would be around 0.9, and the propyl chain would have another methyl?

For example, in a meta-disubstituted benzene, but here perhaps the substituents are in positions that make the protons split into two doublets. \n\nNow let's look at the aliphatic protons.

The NMR for that would have:\n\nThe aromatic peaks from the phenyl group, the ethyl group (CH2CH3) on the phenyl, and the propanoic acid chain.\n\nBut in the given NMR, the aliphatic signals include a sec-butyl group's signals. The 0.9 triplet (CH3), 1.4 doublet (CH(CH3)), 1.7 (CH2), and 2.9 (CH). That suggests a longer chain than an ethyl group. The ethyl would have a triplet (CH3) and a quartet (CH2). The sec-butyl has more carbons. So perhaps option A is not correct.\n\nLooking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would mean the benzene ring has a COOH group (as benzoic acid) and a sec-butyl group on the 4 position. Let's see the NMR of that. The benzene ring would have the COOH on one carbon (say position 1), and the sec-butyl on position 4. The aromatic protons would be split into different signals. The COOH is at position 1, so the adjacent protons (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded, maybe around 8 ppm. The sec-butyl at position 4 would affect the protons at positions 3 and 5, which might be around 7.2 ppm. So the two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 could correspond to those.\n\nThe aliphatic part (the sec-butyl group) would produce the NMR signals listed. Let me see:\n\nThe sec-butyl group structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-? No, wait, the sec-butyl is attached to the benzene ring at position 4.

The phenyl group has an ethyl at the 4-position. \n\nIn that case, the aliphatic part would be the CH2 from the propanoic acid. The ethyl on the phenyl is part of the aromatic ring substitution. The NMR's aliphatic signals would come from the propanoic acid's CH2 and any other groups. But the given NMR shows a more complex chain: the sec-butyl group (as per the peaks at 0.9,1.4,1.7,2.9). So maybe that's more consistent with option C, which has a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring (along with the COOH). \n\nSo in option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid), the structure is benzene with COOH on the 1-position and sec-butyl on 4. The sec-butyl is attached to the 4-position via a single bond, so the chain is: \n\nBenzene ring (positions 1-COOH, 4- attached to the sec-butyl group). The sec-butyl would be -CH(CH3)CH2CH3. The protons of the sec-butyl would be as discussed earlier (the triplet at 0.9, the 1.7 m, 2.9 m, and the 1.4 d). That matches the NMR data. The aromatic peaks would be split into two doublets because of the substituents. \n\nThe benzoic acid (COOH at position 1) would cause the adjacent protons (positions 2 and 6) to be deshielded, so their chemical shifts would be higher. The sec-butyl at position 4 would cause the protons at positions 3 and 5 to be shielded. So the two doublets at 8.0 (higher ppm) and 7.2 (lower ppm) make sense here. \n\nLooking back at the IR peaks: the 1720 cm-1 is the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid (since the carboxylic acid has a carbonyl and an O-H). The other peaks (1610 and 1450) are typical for aromatic rings. \n\nSo that points to option C. But let me check the other options again. \n\nOption D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a benzene with sec-butyl on 1 and methyl on 4. But that's an alkylbenzene, no carboxylic acid. So NMR wouldn't have the 10.5 ppm signal. So D is out. \n\nOption B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, again no acid. \n\nSo the correct answer is either A or C.",

So perhaps the numbering changes based on the priority of substituents. \n\nWhen the COOH is removed, the remaining substituent (sec-butyl) would be the first in numbering, so the sec-butyl is at position 1, and the methyl (from the original COOH's carbon?) is at position 4. Hence, the product is option D. \n\nThat makes sense. The original compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The doublets suggest that the aromatic protons are split into two sets of two protons each. This is typical for a para-disubstituted benzene. For example, if the substituents are in positions 1 and 4. The carboxylic acid is in position 1, and another substituent (alkyl) in position 4. The 8.0 and 7.2 could then be the two sets of protons. So the benzene ring has substituents in para positions.\n\nNow the substituent in position 4 must be an alkyl group. The substituent's NMR peaks are the aliphatic ones.\n\nLooking at the aliphatic peaks:\n\nThe 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): this could be a methine group (CH) in a branch. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): maybe a methylene adjacent to the branch. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl group attached to a CH (so doublet). The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): terminal methyl.\n\nPutting this together, the substituent chain might be like this:\n\nStarting from the benzene ring (position 4), the substituent is a chain that goes through a branch. Let's see:\n\nLet me consider the substituent as a sec-butyl group. The structure would be:\n\n- The benzene is connected to a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that might be a longer chain.",

The 1.7 ppm is another multiplet, maybe another methylene. The 1.4 ppm is a doublet (d, 3H), which is a methyl group attached to a carbon that's next to a CH2 (since the coupling constant would be around 7 Hz, typical for a CH2-CH3). The 0.9 ppm triplet (t, 3H) is probably a terminal methyl group (like in an ethyl group, but the triplet suggests it's the end of a chain).\n\nPutting this together: The NMR suggests a structure with a benzene ring (from the aromatic protons), a carboxylic acid group (from the 10.5 ppm peak), and an alkyl chain attached to the benzene. Let's count the carbons from the NMR peaks. The aromatic protons are 2H each at 8.0 and 7.2, so total 4H on the benzene. The remaining protons are:\n\n1H from the OH (but that's a singlet, already accounted for).\n\nThen the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a CH connected to a branch. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) might be a CH2 between two branches or part of a chain. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH (since the coupling is a doublet, maybe from a CH2-CH group?), and the 0.9 triplet (3H) is a CH2-CH3. So the chain part might be something like CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-... but let me think step by step.\n\nBreaking down the NMR peaks:\n\nThe alkyl chain parts:\n\n- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): this is probably a methyl group at the end of an ethyl group (the triplet suggests a CH2CH3, but the triplet is from the CH2 attached to another CH2 or CH3).",

The NMR for that would have:\n\nThe aromatic peaks from the phenyl group, the ethyl group (CH2CH3) on the phenyl, and the propanoic acid chain.\n\nBut in the given NMR, the aliphatic signals include a sec-butyl group's signals. The 0.9 triplet (CH3), 1.4 doublet (CH(CH3)), 1.7 (CH2), and 2.9 (CH). That suggests a longer chain than an ethyl group. The ethyl would have a triplet (CH3) and a quartet (CH2). The sec-butyl has more carbons. So perhaps option A is not correct.\n\nLooking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would mean the benzene ring has a COOH group (as benzoic acid) and a sec-butyl group on the 4 position. Let's see the NMR of that. The benzene ring would have the COOH on one carbon (say position 1), and the sec-butyl on position 4. The aromatic protons would be split into different signals. The COOH is at position 1, so the adjacent protons (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded, maybe around 8 ppm. The sec-butyl at position 4 would affect the protons at positions 3 and 5, which might be around 7.2 ppm. So the two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 could correspond to those.\n\nThe aliphatic part (the sec-butyl group) would produce the NMR signals listed. Let me see:\n\nThe sec-butyl group structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-? No, wait, the sec-butyl is attached to the benzene ring at position 4. The structure would be:\n\nBenzene (with -COOH on position 1 and -sec-butyl on 4):\n\nThe substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2?",
          "text2": "Wait, perhaps the phenyl group is attached to the CH2 (the second carbon of propanoic acid), so the structure is:\n\nCH2(Ph)CH2COOH. The phenyl group has an ethyl at the 4-position. \n\nIn that case, the aliphatic part would be the CH2 from the propanoic acid. The ethyl on the phenyl is part of the aromatic ring substitution. The NMR's aliphatic signals would come from the propanoic acid's CH2 and any other groups. But the given NMR shows a more complex chain: the sec-butyl group (as per the peaks at 0.9,1.4,1.7,2.9). So maybe that's more consistent with option C, which has a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring (along with the COOH). \n\nSo in option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid), the structure is benzene with COOH on the 1-position and sec-butyl on 4. The sec-butyl is attached to the 4-position via a single bond, so the chain is: \n\nBenzene ring (positions 1-COOH, 4- attached to the sec-butyl group). The sec-butyl would be -CH(CH3)CH2CH3. The protons of the sec-butyl would be as discussed earlier (the triplet at 0.9, the 1.7 m, 2.9 m, and the 1.4 d). That matches the NMR data. The aromatic peaks would be split into two doublets because of the substituents. \n\nThe benzoic acid (COOH at position 1) would cause the adjacent protons (positions 2 and 6) to be deshielded, so their chemical shifts would be higher. The sec-butyl at position 4 would cause the protons at positions 3 and 5 to be shielded. So the two doublets at 8.0 (higher ppm) and 7.2 (lower ppm) make sense here. \n\nLooking back at the IR peaks: the 1720 cm-1 is the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid (since the carboxylic acid has a carbonyl and an O-H). The other peaks (1610 and 1450) are typical for aromatic rings. \n\nSo that points to option C. But let me check the other options again. \n\nOption D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a benzene with sec-butyl on 1 and methyl on 4. But that's an alkylbenzene, no carboxylic acid. So NMR wouldn't have the 10.5 ppm signal. So D is out. \n\nOption B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, again no acid. \n\nSo the correct answer is either A or C.",

So the molecule is:\n\nCOOH-CH2-CH(Ph)-CH2? No, not sure. This might be getting too complicated. Let's look at the NMR data again for option C and A.\n\nIf option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then the substituent on the benzene (para to COOH) is sec-butyl. The NMR of the sec-butyl group would have:\n\nThe terminal methyl (0.9 ppm), a methylene (1.7 ppm), a methine (2.9 ppm), and another methyl (the 1.4 ppm). Which matches the given data (0.9, 1.7, 2.9, 1.4). \n\nThe 1.4 ppm is a doublet, so that's a methyl group attached to a CH. The CH (2.9 ppm) is connected to that methyl and the rest of the chain. The chain goes on to the methylene (1.7) and the terminal methyl (0.9). That seems to fit the sec-butyl group. \n\nSo option C would have the correct substituent. Let's check the aromatic region. Benzoic acid normally has aromatic peaks around 7.5\u20138.0 ppm. Adding a sec-butyl group (electron-donating) on the para position would cause the adjacent protons to be deshielded a bit, but the meta and para positions would have different shifts. The given peaks are 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). That suggests that there are two sets of protons, each as a doublet. For a para-substituted benzoic acid with another substituent (the sec-butyl), the substituents are on opposite sides. The para positions would have the -COOH and sec-butyl, so the aromatic protons adjacent to them would be meta to both. The two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 could be the ortho and meta positions, but maybe they are the two protons on either side of the substituents.",

The phenyl group has an ethyl at the 4-position. \n\nIn that case, the aliphatic part would be the CH2 from the propanoic acid. The ethyl on the phenyl is part of the aromatic ring substitution. The NMR's aliphatic signals would come from the propanoic acid's CH2 and any other groups. But the given NMR shows a more complex chain: the sec-butyl group (as per the peaks at 0.9,1.4,1.7,2.9). So maybe that's more consistent with option C, which has a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring (along with the COOH). \n\nSo in option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid), the structure is benzene with COOH on the 1-position and sec-butyl on 4. The sec-butyl is attached to the 4-position via a single bond, so the chain is: \n\nBenzene ring (positions 1-COOH, 4- attached to the sec-butyl group). The sec-butyl would be -CH(CH3)CH2CH3. The protons of the sec-butyl would be as discussed earlier (the triplet at 0.9, the 1.7 m, 2.9 m, and the 1.4 d). That matches the NMR data. The aromatic peaks would be split into two doublets because of the substituents. \n\nThe benzoic acid (COOH at position 1) would cause the adjacent protons (positions 2 and 6) to be deshielded, so their chemical shifts would be higher. The sec-butyl at position 4 would cause the protons at positions 3 and 5 to be shielded. So the two doublets at 8.0 (higher ppm) and 7.2 (lower ppm) make sense here. \n\nLooking back at the IR peaks: the 1720 cm-1 is the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid (since the carboxylic acid has a carbonyl and an O-H). The other peaks (1610 and 1450) are typical for aromatic rings. \n\nSo that points to option C. But let me check the other options again. \n\nOption D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a benzene with sec-butyl on 1 and methyl on 4. But that's an alkylbenzene, no carboxylic acid. So NMR wouldn't have the 10.5 ppm signal. So D is out. \n\nOption B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, again no acid. \n\nSo the correct answer is either A or C.",

For example, the two substituents (carboxylic acid and sec-butyl) are para, leading to specific proton environments. \n\nIn option C's case, the aromatic ring has the carboxylic acid on, say, position 1 and the sec-butyl on position 4. The remaining protons would be on 2,3,5,6. The protons at 2 and 6 are adjacent to the substituents (position 1 and 4), so their chemical shifts would be higher (like 8 ppm), while those at 3 and 5 are further away, maybe around 7.2 ppm. Hence, the two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 could correspond to these. \n\nThe multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H) would be the CH in the sec-butyl group's branch (the CH(CH3)), and the 1.4 ppm doublet is the methyl branch on that carbon. The triplet at 0.9 is the terminal methyl of the sec-butyl chain. The 1.7 ppm multiplet is the middle CH2 group. \n\nThis seems to fit option C. \n\nNow, looking back at the reaction with red phosphorus and HI. The question states that compound X (which we've deduced is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) reacts with red phosphorus and HI. What's the product?\n\nRed phosphorus and HI are often used in the preparation of alkyl iodides. Specifically, when an alcohol is treated with HI, it can form an alkyl iodide and water.

The aromatic peaks at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm would correspond to the other protons on the benzene ring.\n\nNow, the reaction part: what happens when compound X (which is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) reacts with red phosphorus and HI?\n\nRed phosphorus and HI are reagents used in the preparation of acyl iodides (acid iodides) from carboxylic acids. The reaction is: \n\nRCOOH + P + HI \u2192 RCOI + P(O)(OH)2 + H2O \n\nBut the exact reaction conditions might form the acyl iodide.

The ethyl group's CH2 (from the phenyl's substituent) would be around 1.2-1.4 ppm, and the terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm. \n\nThat might align with the given NMR data. Let's see:\n\nThe terminal CH3 (ethyl's CH2CH3): the CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). \n\nThe CH2 of the ethyl group would be at around 1.2 ppm (quartet?), but the given NMR has a 1.4 ppm d (3H) which might be the methyl from the ethyl group? No, the ethyl's CH2 would be a quartet adjacent to the CH3. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me compare the possible options again with the NMR data.\n\nThe given NMR has a 1.4 ppm d (3H) which is a triplet. That suggests a methyl group adjacent to a CH2 with two protons. \n\nIn option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid), the sec-butyl group would have a methyl branch (the 1.4 ppm), which fits. \n\nOption D's structure (1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene) would have a sec-butyl and a methyl on the benzene ring. The NMR of such a compound would have different aromatic peaks and alkyl peaks. \n\nThe problem is determining what happens when compound X (which I thought was option C) reacts with HI and red phosphorus. If compound X is C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid), then the reaction product would be the decarboxylated product, which is a benzene ring with the sec-butyl on carbon4 and a hydrogen where the COOH was. That would be 1-methyl? No, just a hydrogen. So the product would be sec-butylbenzene with the sec-butyl on carbon4. \n\nBut that's not among the options. The options are:\n\nA) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid\n\nB) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene\n\nC) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (this is compound X)\n\nD) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\nAh!

The NMR's aliphatic signals would come from the propanoic acid's CH2 and any other groups. But the given NMR shows a more complex chain: the sec-butyl group (as per the peaks at 0.9,1.4,1.7,2.9). So maybe that's more consistent with option C, which has a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring (along with the COOH). \n\nSo in option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid), the structure is benzene with COOH on the 1-position and sec-butyl on 4.

So the two doublets at 8.0 (higher ppm) and 7.2 (lower ppm) make sense here. \n\nLooking back at the IR peaks: the 1720 cm-1 is the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid (since the carboxylic acid has a carbonyl and an O-H).
