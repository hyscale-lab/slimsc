The reactions given in the options involve various steps like nitration, sulfonation, alkylation, acylation, etc. Let me look at the options and see each step sequence.\n\nFirst, the tert-butyl group is an alkyl group, so that would be introduced via an alkylating agent, like using a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 would be the reagent for that. But Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride would form the tert-butyl group.

The nitro is at 3, which is next to 2 (tert-butyl) and 4 (but since only three substituents, maybe 3 is between 2 and 4, but only three groups are present. Hmm, perhaps the numbering is such that the ethoxy is at 1, then tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So the ethoxy is between the tert-butyl and the nitro? So the tert-butyl and nitro are separated by one position (positions 2 and 3). So the nitro is meta to the ethoxy (positions 1 and 3 are two apart, so meta to each other).\n\nNow, to get the nitro at 3, which is adjacent to the tert-butyl (position 2), the nitro must be placed ortho to the tert-butyl. Since the tert-butyl is an activating group, ortho/para directing, so if we add the tert-butyl first, then the nitro can be added in the ortho position (position 3). Then the ethoxy must be placed at position 1. When adding the ethoxy, the presence of nitro (which is meta directing) and tert-butyl (ortho/para) would influence its placement. Since the ethoxy is an activating group, it would be directed by the existing groups. \n\nSince the nitro is already present (at position 3), the ethoxy placement is influenced by both the nitro and the tert-butyl. The nitro group is meta directing, so it would direct the ethoxy to positions meta to itself (positions 1 and 5). The tert-butyl is ortho/para directing, so it would direct to positions 1 and 4. The overlapping of these directions is position 1 (meta to nitro and ortho to tert-butyl). Thus, adding the ethoxy at position 1 would satisfy both directing effects. \n\nTherefore, the order should be:\n\n1. Add tert-butyl (position 2 via Friedel-Crafts).\n\n2. Add nitro (position 3, ortho to tert-butyl).\n\n3. Add ethoxy (position 1, meta to nitro and ortho to tert-butyl).\n\nNow, the question is how to do the ethoxy addition. Since the ethoxy group is an ether, it's typically added via Williamson ether synthesis, which requires a good leaving group at the desired position. Therefore, before adding ethoxy, we need to have a halide at position 1.\n\nTo introduce a halide at position 1, after adding the nitro and tert-butyl, we need to perform a halogenation.

The tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 would be the reagent for that. But Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride would form the tert-butyl group. However, Friedel-Crafts alkylation can sometimes lead to carbocation rearrangements, but tert-butyl chloride doesn't have a carbocation that would rearrange, so that's okay. So the first step in options A, B, C starts with that. Option D starts with nitration first, so that might not be right. Let me check each option's steps.\n\nThe target has three groups: tert-butyl (alkyl), ethoxy (ether), nitro.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the order of substitution.\n\nThe problem is that each substituent affects the reactivity of the benzene ring. To get the desired product, the substituents must be introduced in an order that allows each subsequent substitution to occur in the desired position. \n\nFirst, the tert-butyl group is an alkyl group, which is an electron-donating group (EDG). The nitro group is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG). The ethoxy group is also an EDG, but it's an oxygen which can act as a directing group. \n\nThe general strategy for directing groups: \n\n- Alkyl groups (like tert-butyl) are ortho/para directors.\n- Nitro groups (EWG) are meta directors.\n- Ether groups (like ethoxy) are also ortho/para directors but they are weaker than alkyls, but still EDG.\n\nBut the order in which the substituents are added matters because each addition affects the positions available for the next substitution. \n\nThe target molecule has the nitro group at position 3. Since nitro is a meta director, wherever it is placed, the next substituent would have to go meta to it. But the tert-butyl and ethoxy groups are both ortho/para directors.

The steps given in the options involve various reactions like nitration (HNO3/H2SO4), sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4), Friedel-Crafts alkylation (tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3), acylation (maybe), and then some kind of substitution like the Williamson ether synthesis (NaOH/EtBr for ethoxy group). Also, there might be steps like hydrolysis (dilute H2SO4), maybe nitration again, and so on.\n\nThe key here is the order of adding substituents. Let's see:\n\nFirst, benzene starts with no substituents. The first reaction in each option must be the first substituent. Let's look at the options:\n\nOption A starts with Friedel-Crafts alkylation (tert-butyl group). Then nitration, then sulfonation, then some others.\n\nOption D starts with nitration first. \n\nThe target has a tert-butyl and an ethoxy group. Both are alkyl/ether groups which are EDG. Since nitro is EWG, it should be added after the EDG groups, because EWGs make the ring less reactive. So if you add nitro early, it might hinder further EDG substitutions.",

But now there are two substituents: tert-butyl at 2 and nitro at 3. The nitro group is a meta director, so it would direct the next substituent to meta positions relative to itself. The tert-butyl is at 2, which is ortho/para directing. The ethoxy has to go to position 1. Let's see:\n\nThe nitro at 3 would direct the ethoxy to positions 1 or 5 (meta to 3). The tert-butyl at 2 would allow the ethoxy to be at 1 (ortho to 2). Since both the nitro (meta directing) and the tert-butyl (ortho directing) are present, which one has priority? The nitro is a stronger director than the tert-butyl. Since the nitro is a meta director, it would control the direction. Therefore, the ethoxy would be placed at position 1 (meta to nitro at 3, and ortho to tert-butyl at 2). That works because position 1 is meta to nitro (3) and ortho to tert-butyl (2).

Since the tert-butyl is an activating group, ortho/para directing, so if we add the tert-butyl first, then the nitro can be added in the ortho position (position 3). Then the ethoxy must be placed at position 1. When adding the ethoxy, the presence of nitro (which is meta directing) and tert-butyl (ortho/para) would influence its placement.

The sulfonic acid is a strong deactivator and meta director. The tert-butyl is ortho/para directing. The nitration would be difficult on a ring with a sulfonic acid (strongly deactivating). Maybe the nitro would go at the position ortho to the tert-butyl but not blocked by sulfonic acid. For example, if sulfonic is at position 1 (added after tert at 2), then nitration would be directed to position 3 (ortho to tert), but sulfonic at 1 makes that area deactivating. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for the correct order of steps based on standard synthesis.\n\nThe target has three groups: tert-butyl (position 2), nitro (3), ethoxy (1).\n\nTo place the ethoxy at 1, which is meta to nitro (position 3) and ortho to tert-butyl (position 2), the ethoxy must be added last, because the presence of nitro and tert-butyl would direct it there.\n\nThe steps would be:\n\n1. Add tert-butyl (position 2 via Friedel-Crafts).\n\n2. Add nitro (position 3, ortho to tert-butyl).\n\n3. Add ethoxy at position 1 (meta to nitro and ortho to tert-butyl).\n\nTo add the ethoxy last, the steps for it would require either:\n\n- Halogenation at position 1 (via Fe/HCl), then displacement with ethoxide (NaOH/EtBr).\n\nOR\n\n- Sulfonation at position 1, then displacement.\n\nThe correct sequence would need to have the ethoxy introduced last.

The ortho positions are 1 and 3. So the nitro could go to position1 or 3. \n\nHowever, we need the nitro at position3. So if the nitration occurs at position3 (ortho to the tert-butyl), that would work. Because the tert-butyl directs to ortho/para, so nitro can be at 1 or 3.

But now there are two substituents: tert-butyl at 2 and nitro at 3. The nitro group is a meta director, so it would direct the next substituent to meta positions relative to itself. The tert-butyl is at 2, which is ortho/para directing. The ethoxy has to go to position 1. Let's see:\n\nThe nitro at 3 would direct the ethoxy to positions 1 or 5 (meta to 3).

Hmm, perhaps the numbering is such that the ethoxy is at 1, then tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So the ethoxy is between the tert-butyl and the nitro? So the tert-butyl and nitro are separated by one position (positions 2 and 3). So the nitro is meta to the ethoxy (positions 1 and 3 are two apart, so meta to each other).\n\nNow, to get the nitro at 3, which is adjacent to the tert-butyl (position 2), the nitro must be placed ortho to the tert-butyl. Since the tert-butyl is an activating group, ortho/para directing, so if we add the tert-butyl first, then the nitro can be added in the ortho position (position 3). Then the ethoxy must be placed at position 1. When adding the ethoxy, the presence of nitro (which is meta directing) and tert-butyl (ortho/para) would influence its placement.

Thus, adding the ethoxy at position 1 would satisfy both directing effects. \n\nTherefore, the order should be:\n\n1. Add tert-butyl (position 2 via Friedel-Crafts).\n\n2.

Alkylation with tert-butyl chloride (step i in options A/B/C).\n\n2. Nitration to place nitro group (step ii).\n\n3. Convert the nitro group to a diazonium salt (steps involving NaNO2/HCl).\n\n4.
