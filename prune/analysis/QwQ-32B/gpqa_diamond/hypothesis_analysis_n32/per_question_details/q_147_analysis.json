So their velocities would all have the same magnitude, but directions such that vectors cancel. Therefore, their speeds would all be the same. So we can model them as moving in pairs with opposite directions, but same speed. \n\nNow, the next step is to apply conservation of energy. The initial rest energy is the sum of the proton and antiproton rest masses. Since proton and antiproton have the same mass, which is about 938 MeV/c\u00b2 each.

So E_p \u2248 m_p c\u00b2 and E_p\u0304 \u2248 m_p c\u00b2. So total E_initial = 2 * m_p c\u00b2 \u2248 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV.\n\nThe total momentum before annihilation is p_initial = p_p + p_p\u0304. The proton is at rest, so p_p =0. The antiproton's momentum is p_p\u0304 = gamma_p\u0304 * m_p v_p\u0304, but since it's slowly moving, gamma \u22481, so p_p\u0304 \u2248 m_p v_p\u0304.

Let me consider two particles moving in the +x direction and two in the -x direction. Then each has momentum p and -p. The total momentum is zero.\n\nThe total energy after annihilation is the sum of the four particles' energies. Each particle has energy gamma_A * m_A c\u00b2. So total energy:\n\n4 * gamma_A * m_A c\u00b2 = E_initial = 1876 MeV.\n\nWe can solve for gamma_A:\n\ngamma_A = 1876 / (4 * 300) = same as before, 1.5633.\n\nNow, the momentum of each particle is p = gamma_A * m_A v.\n\nBut the total momentum must be zero, so the momenta cancel. But since they are moving in opposite directions, the magnitude of each pair must be equal. Since all four have the same speed and mass, their magnitudes are equal. So the momentum of each is same in magnitude. But since the total momentum is zero, this is satisfied as long as the momenta are in opposite directions.

Let's formalize this.\n\nThe total energy before annihilation is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton. Since they are at rest, kinetic energy is zero. So total energy is 2*(m_p c\u00b2) where m_p is proton mass.

So their velocities would all have the same magnitude, but directions such that vectors cancel. Therefore, their speeds would all be the same.

The total momentum is zero.\n\nThe total energy after annihilation is the sum of the four particles' energies. Each particle has energy gamma_A * m_A c\u00b2. So total energy:\n\n4 * gamma_A * m_A c\u00b2 = E_initial = 1876 MeV.\n\nWe can solve for gamma_A:\n\ngamma_A = 1876 / (4 * 300) = same as before, 1.5633.\n\nNow, the momentum of each particle is p = gamma_A * m_A v.\n\nBut the total momentum must be zero, so the momenta cancel. But since they are moving in opposite directions, the magnitude of each pair must be equal. Since all four have the same speed and mass, their magnitudes are equal. So the momentum of each is same in magnitude. But since the total momentum is zero, this is satisfied as long as the momenta are in opposite directions. So that's okay.\n\nNow, since we need to find v, we can use the relation between gamma, v, and m_A.\n\nWe know that gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)\n\nSo, rearranged:\n\nv = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma\u00b2))\n\nPlugging in gamma=1.5633:\n\n1/gamma\u00b2 = 1/(1.5633)^2 \u2248 0.409, so 1 - 0.409 =0.591, square root is ~0.77c.

Let's formalize this.\n\nThe total energy before annihilation is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton. Since they are at rest, kinetic energy is zero. So total energy is 2*(m_p c\u00b2) where m_p is proton mass. The proton mass is about 938 MeV/c\u00b2, so total energy is 2*938 = 1876 MeV.\n\nThe products are four particles (2 of A+ and 2 of A-), each with rest mass m_A. The total rest mass energy of the products is 4*m_A c\u00b2 = 4*300 = 1200 MeV. Since 1200 is less than 1876, there's excess energy which must be the kinetic energy of the particles.\n\nBut since momentum must be conserved, and the initial momentum is zero, the total momentum of the products must also be zero.

So their velocities would all have the same magnitude, but directions such that vectors cancel. Therefore, their speeds would all be the same.

So the four particles must have equal and opposite momenta. Since they are produced in pairs, maybe each pair has opposite momenta. But perhaps all four are moving with the same speed but in directions such that their momenta cancel. \n\nAssuming that all four particles have the same speed and direction in pairs. Let me think in terms of energy and momentum conservation.\n\nLet me denote the rest mass of A as m_A = 300 MeV/c\u00b2. The proton and antiproton each have mass m_p = 938 MeV/c\u00b2. The initial momentum is negligible because the antiproton is slowly moving, so initial momentum is approximately zero. Therefore, the final total momentum must also be zero. So the total momentum of the four particles must cancel out. \n\nAssuming that each A+ and A\u2013 pair moves in opposite directions, so their momenta cancel. Since there are two A+ and two A\u2013, perhaps they move in two pairs, each pair in opposite directions. For simplicity, maybe all four particles move with the same speed, and their directions are arranged so that the total momentum is zero. \n\nSo, for each particle, the momentum is p = gamma * m_A * v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Since their momenta must cancel, the total momentum would be sum of all vectors. Let's assume they are moving in opposite directions in pairs. Let's say two particles move in +x and two in -x, each with the same speed. Then their momenta would be +p and -p each, so total momentum is zero. \n\nTherefore, each of the four particles has the same magnitude of momentum. Let me denote each particle's momentum as p. The total energy of the four particles is then 4 * (gamma * m_A c\u00b2). This must equal the initial total energy, which is 2 * m_p c\u00b2 (since kinetic energy of antiproton is negligible). \n\nSo:\n\n4 * (gamma * m_A c\u00b2) = 2 * m_p c\u00b2 \n\nSolving for gamma:\n\ngamma = (2 m_p c\u00b2) / (4 m_A c\u00b2) ) = (m_p)/(2 m_A)",
          "text2": "Alternatively, perhaps the antiproton is moving slowly so that the total initial momentum is negligible. Let me think.\n\nThe key idea here is that in the annihilation process, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the antiproton is slowly moving, maybe the initial momentum is approximately zero. That would mean that the protons and antiproton are nearly at rest, so their total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the final particles must have momenta that cancel each other out. Since there are two A+ and two A-, perhaps they move in opposite directions symmetrically. \n\nAssuming that the initial momentum is zero, then the final particles must have zero total momentum. Let's suppose that the four particles are emitted in such a way that their momenta cancel. For instance, maybe two A+ go in one direction and two A- in the opposite, so their vectors sum to zero. So each of the particles must have equal magnitude and opposite direction momenta, but since there are two of each, maybe arranged in pairs. Anyway, the total momentum is zero. Therefore, each pair's momentum must cancel out.\n\nTherefore, the total energy in the final state is the sum of the energies of the four particles, which must equal the initial total energy (the sum of the rest masses of proton and antiproton, since their kinetic energy is negligible).\n\nSo the initial energy is (m_p + m_pbar)c\u00b2 = 2*(938 MeV) = 1876 MeV.

So their velocities would all have the same magnitude, but directions such that vectors cancel. Therefore, their speeds would all be the same.
