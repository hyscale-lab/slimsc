When the field is turned off, then turned on along +Y, the new Hamiltonian is H_y = -\u03b3 B Sy. But when exactly does the field switch? The problem says \"suddenly turned off, and another is turned on\". So we can consider that the initial state is the eigenstate of Sz with +1/2, and then the system is subjected to the new Hamiltonian H_y. \n\nThe question is about the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment over time. Since the magnetic moment is \u03bc = \u03b3 Sz, the average \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 is \u03b3 times the expectation value of Sz. So we need to find \u27e8Sz(t)\u27e9 as a function of time under the new Hamiltonian H_y, and then find the oscillation frequency of that.\n\nAlright, so let's model this. The initial state is |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9. The new Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B Sy. The time evolution of the state will be governed by H.

The problem says \"suddenly the magnetic field is turned off, and another is turned on along +Y direction\". So the switching is instantaneous. The Hamiltonian changes abruptly from B_z to 0 then to B_y? Or maybe the first is turned off and the second turned on simultaneously. Maybe I should model it as the Hamiltonian suddenly changing from H_initial = -\u03bc\u00b7B_initial (which was along Z) to H_final = -\u03bc\u00b7B_final (along Y). Since the magnitude B is the same, the new field is B in the Y direction.\n\nThe key here is that when the Hamiltonian changes, the state of the system doesn't change instantaneously. The state remains in the original eigenstate until the Hamiltonian changes, and then it starts to evolve under the new Hamiltonian. So the initial state is |+z>, but under the new Hamiltonian H = -\u03b3 S_y * B (since B is along Y now, so the Hamiltonian would involve S_y component?), the system will start to precess, leading to time dependence in the expectation values of other components, like Sz.\n\nWe need to find the average of the z-component of the moment as a function of time and determine its oscillation frequency. Let me try to formalize this.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field B is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B = -\u03b3 S\u00b7B. Since the magnetic field is along Y, H = -\u03b3 B S_y. The eigenstates of S_y are different from those of S_z. The particle was initially in the |+z> state, which is not an eigenstate of S_y.

Let me use the eigenstates of S_z as the basis. The initial state is |+z>. Let me write the Hamiltonian matrix in the S_z basis.

Plugging in H, that becomes exp( i (\u03c9/2) \u03c3y t ). Since \u03c3y squared is the identity matrix, the exponential can be simplified.

Then, when the magnetic field is in the z-direction, the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz, so the z-component of \u03bc is gamma Sz. But when the B field is turned to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -\u03bc\u00b7B = -\u03b3 S \u00b7 B = -\u03b3 B S_y (since B is along Y). \n\nSo the key is that the system is in an eigenstate of Sz (the +z state) when the Hamiltonian suddenly becomes proportional to Sy. The time evolution will then cause the state to rotate, leading the expectation value of Sz (and thus the z-component of the magnetic moment) to oscillate.\n\nThe frequency of the oscillation is determined by the energy splitting between the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian, which is H = -\u03b3 B Sy. The eigenvalues of Sy are \u00b1 (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2 ), perhaps? Let me check. The spin operator Sy has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2, so multiplying by -\u03b3 B gives eigenvalues of \u2213 (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2 ). The energy difference between these two states is (\u03b3 B \u0127) (since the difference between (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2 ) and - (\u03b3 B \u0127 /2 ) is \u03b3 B \u0127 ). The frequency is this energy difference divided by \u0127, so (\u03b3 B \u0127)/\u0127 = \u03b3 B. \n\nTherefore, the transition frequency between the two states is \u03b3 B. But the oscillation frequency of the expectation value of Sz would be the same as the Larmor frequency, which is \u03b3 B. However, wait, maybe there's a factor here because the initial state is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian.\n\nThe initial state is |+z\u27e9, which is a superposition of the eigenstates of Sy. Let me think. The eigenstates of Sy are different from those of Sz. So when the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B Sy, the system's state will evolve according to the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The expectation value of Sz will oscillate with a frequency related to the energy splitting. \n\nThe general formula for the oscillation frequency of an expectation value when the system is in a state that's a superposition of the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian is given by the difference in energy eigenvalues divided by h-bar. Since the energy difference here is \u03b3 B \u0127 (since the eigenvalues of Sy are \u00b1\u0127/2, so multiplying by -\u03b3 B gives energies of \u2213 \u03b3 B (\u0127/2), so the difference between the two is \u03b3 B \u0127).

So the problem's wording might just be indicating that the z-component is gamma Sz, but the full vector is gamma S. That makes sense. So the Hamiltonian in the new field is H = - \u03bc \u00b7 B = - gamma S_y B, since the field is along Y. \n\nSo the new Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy. The system's state will start evolving under this Hamiltonian. The initial state is the Sz+ eigenstate. Since Sy and Sz don't commute, the state will start to precess, leading to oscillations in the expectation values of Sz over time. The question is about the frequency of these oscillations.\n\nTo find the oscillation frequency, we can model this as a two-level system. The Hamiltonian in this case is H = -\u03b3 B S_y. Let me write the Hamiltonian in matrix form. Since the spin is 1/2, the Pauli matrices are the basis. \n\nExpressed in the Sz basis (|+z>, |-z>), the Sy operator is (\u0127/2) times the Pauli matrix \u03c3y.

The Hamiltonian H is proportional to Sy. The state will evolve into a superposition of |+z> and |-z> over time. The expectation value of Sz will oscillate as a function of time. The frequency of this oscillation is related to the energy difference between the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian H.\n\nSo first, let's find the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H.

The eigenvalues of Sy are \u00b1 (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2 ), perhaps? Let me check. The spin operator Sy has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2, so multiplying by -\u03b3 B gives eigenvalues of \u2213 (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2 ).

But perhaps in this problem's setup, since mu is given as gamma*S_z, maybe the actual matrix for S_z is in units where the eigenvalues are \u00b11/2 (so without the \u0127), so that the magnetic moment would have units of gamma*(\u0127/2). Hmm, but perhaps this is overcomplicating. Let's just proceed with the calculation in terms of the matrices as given by Pauli matrices. \n\nAssuming S_z is (\u0127/2) times the Pauli-Z matrix.

The magnetic moment \u03bc_z is gamma times S_z, so \u03bc_z = gamma * S_z. Therefore, the average \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 is gamma * \u27e8S_z\u27e9. \n\nPlugging in the expression we found:\n\n\u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 = gamma * (\u0127/2) cos(2\u03b8) \n\nBut \u03b8 is (gamma B t)/2.

The cosine function has a frequency of (gamma B) / (2\u03c0), since the general form is cos(\u03c9 t), so \u03c9 = gamma B. Hence, the angular frequency is gamma B, so the frequency in Hz would be omega/(2pi), but the question is asking for the oscillation frequency. Since the options are given in terms of angular frequency (since they have gamma*B terms, which would be in rad/s), the answer would be gamma B.",

The gyromagnetic ratio \u03b3 typically has units of (rad/s)/(T), so that \u03b3*B would give angular frequency in rad/s. \n\nTherefore, if \u03bc = \u03b3 Sz, then when you have the Hamiltonian H = -\u03bc\u00b7B, which in this case, when the B is in the Y direction, the Hamiltonian would be H = -\u03b3 Sz B_y, but wait no, no, the spin's magnetic moment is \u03bc = \u03b3 S. So the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B = - \u03b3 S \u00b7 B. So when the field is in the Y direction, H is proportional to S_y. \n\nHowever, the energy levels depend on the eigenvalues of S_y multiplied by -\u03b3 B. \n\nThe energy eigenvalues were E_+ = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2 ), and E_- = \u03b3 B (\u0127/2 ). Thus, the energy difference between the two states is \u0394E = E_- - E_+ = \u03b3 B (\u0127/2 ) - (- \u03b3 B \u0127/2 ) = \u03b3 B \u0127. \n\nThe frequency associated with this energy difference is \u0394E/(h-bar) = \u03b3 B.

Hmm, the question defines mu as gamma*S_z. The standard formula for magnetic moment is \u03bc = \u03b3 S, where \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio, which has units of (rad/s)/(T), so that when multiplied by B (Tesla), gives rad/s. So in that case, perhaps gamma is already gamma/(\u0127), so that H = -\u03bc\u00b7B = -gamma S_z B. Therefore, the Hamiltonian H would have units of energy (since gamma has units of (rad/s)/(T), B in T, so gamma*B gives rad/s, but S_z has units of \u0127, so H would be -gamma * S_z * B, which would have units (rad/s * \u0127).",

          "text1": "Wait a second, actually the direction of the field is important here. The original field was along +Z, so the Hamiltonian was H_z = -\u03b3 B Sz. When the field is turned off, then turned on along +Y, the new Hamiltonian is H_y = -\u03b3 B Sy. But when exactly does the field switch? The problem says \"suddenly turned off, and another is turned on\". So we can consider that the initial state is the eigenstate of Sz with +1/2, and then the system is subjected to the new Hamiltonian H_y. \n\nThe question is about the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment over time. Since the magnetic moment is \u03bc = \u03b3 Sz, the average \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 is \u03b3 times the expectation value of Sz. So we need to find \u27e8Sz(t)\u27e9 as a function of time under the new Hamiltonian H_y, and then find the oscillation frequency of that.\n\nAlright, so let's model this. The initial state is |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9. The new Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B Sy. The time evolution of the state will be governed by H. Since H is time-independent after the switch, the state at time t is |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = exp(-i H t / \u0127) |\u03c8(0)\u27e9. \n\nBut first, let's note that Sy is the spin operator along y.

The problem says \"suddenly the magnetic field is turned off, and another is turned on along +Y direction\". So the switching is instantaneous. The Hamiltonian changes abruptly from B_z to 0 then to B_y? Or maybe the first is turned off and the second turned on simultaneously. Maybe I should model it as the Hamiltonian suddenly changing from H_initial = -\u03bc\u00b7B_initial (which was along Z) to H_final = -\u03bc\u00b7B_final (along Y). Since the magnitude B is the same, the new field is B in the Y direction.\n\nThe key here is that when the Hamiltonian changes, the state of the system doesn't change instantaneously. The state remains in the original eigenstate until the Hamiltonian changes, and then it starts to evolve under the new Hamiltonian. So the initial state is |+z>, but under the new Hamiltonian H = -\u03b3 S_y * B (since B is along Y now, so the Hamiltonian would involve S_y component?), the system will start to precess, leading to time dependence in the expectation values of other components, like Sz.\n\nWe need to find the average of the z-component of the moment as a function of time and determine its oscillation frequency. Let me try to formalize this.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field B is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B = -\u03b3 S\u00b7B. Since the magnetic field is along Y, H = -\u03b3 B S_y. The eigenstates of S_y are different from those of S_z. The particle was initially in the |+z> state, which is not an eigenstate of S_y.

So the spin will precess around the Y-axis with that frequency. \n\nBut the question is about the oscillation of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is proportional to \u27e8Sz\u27e9. So we need to see how \u27e8Sz\u27e9 evolves with time. \n\nLet me think about the time dependence. Let's consider the state |\u03c8(t)\u27e9, which starts as |+z\u27e9 at t=0. The Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy. So the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( -i H t / \u0127 ). Let's write H as -gamma B Sy, so substituting:\n\nU(t) = exp( i gamma B Sy t / \u0127 )\n\nNow, we can represent Sz and Sy in terms of Pauli matrices. For spin 1/2, Sx, Sy, Sz are proportional to the Pauli matrices. Let me denote the Pauli matrices as \u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z, so that S = (\u0127/2) \u03c3. Therefore, Sy = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y, so substituting into H:\n\nH = - gamma B * (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y \n\nThus, H = - (gamma B \u0127 / 2) \u03c3_y \n\nTherefore, the Hamiltonian is proportional to \u03c3_y. The time evolution operator becomes:\n\nU(t) = exp( i H t / \u0127 ) = exp( i [ - (gamma B \u0127 / 2) \u03c3_y ] t / \u0127 ) \n\nSimplifying the exponent:\n\ni [ - (gamma B \u0127 / 2) \u03c3_y] t / \u0127 = -i (gamma B t / 2 ) \u03c3_y \n\nSo U(t) = exp( -i (gamma B t / 2 ) \u03c3_y )\n\nNow, the time-dependent state is:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = U(t) |+z\u27e9 \n\nWe need to compute \u27e8Sz\u27e9(t) = \u27e8\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 \n\nSince Sz is (\u0127/2) \u03c3_z, but since we have the constants, perhaps we can work in units where \u0127 = 1 for simplicity, but let me see.",
          "text2": "Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the standard vector relationship where the magnetic moment \u03bc is proportional to the spin vector. So \u03bc = \u03b3 S. Then, when the magnetic field is in the z-direction, the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz, so the z-component of \u03bc is gamma Sz. But when the B field is turned to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -\u03bc\u00b7B = -\u03b3 S \u00b7 B = -\u03b3 B S_y (since B is along Y). \n\nSo the key is that the system is in an eigenstate of Sz (the +z state) when the Hamiltonian suddenly becomes proportional to Sy. The time evolution will then cause the state to rotate, leading the expectation value of Sz (and thus the z-component of the magnetic moment) to oscillate.\n\nThe frequency of the oscillation is determined by the energy splitting between the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian, which is H = -\u03b3 B Sy. The eigenvalues of Sy are \u00b1 (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2 ), perhaps? Let me check. The spin operator Sy has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2, so multiplying by -\u03b3 B gives eigenvalues of \u2213 (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2 ). The energy difference between these two states is (\u03b3 B \u0127) (since the difference between (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2 ) and - (\u03b3 B \u0127 /2 ) is \u03b3 B \u0127 ). The frequency is this energy difference divided by \u0127, so (\u03b3 B \u0127)/\u0127 = \u03b3 B. \n\nTherefore, the transition frequency between the two states is \u03b3 B. But the oscillation frequency of the expectation value of Sz would be the same as the Larmor frequency, which is \u03b3 B. However, wait, maybe there's a factor here because the initial state is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian.\n\nThe initial state is |+z\u27e9, which is a superposition of the eigenstates of Sy. Let me think. The eigenstates of Sy are different from those of Sz. So when the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B Sy, the system's state will evolve according to the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The expectation value of Sz will oscillate with a frequency related to the energy splitting. \n\nThe general formula for the oscillation frequency of an expectation value when the system is in a state that's a superposition of the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian is given by the difference in energy eigenvalues divided by h-bar. Since the energy difference here is \u03b3 B \u0127 (since the eigenvalues of Sy are \u00b1\u0127/2, so multiplying by -\u03b3 B gives energies of \u2213 \u03b3 B (\u0127/2), so the difference between the two is \u03b3 B \u0127).

So substituting that in:\n\n\u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 = (gamma \u0127/2) cos( 2*(gamma B t)/2 ) \n\nSimplifying the argument of the cosine: 2*(gamma B t)/2 = gamma B t. \n\nSo \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 = (gamma \u0127/2) cos(gamma B t) \n\nNow, the problem asks for the oscillation frequency of this average. The cosine function has a frequency of (gamma B) / (2\u03c0), since the general form is cos(\u03c9 t), so \u03c9 = gamma B. Hence, the angular frequency is gamma B, so the frequency in Hz would be omega/(2pi), but the question is asking for the oscillation frequency. Since the options are given in terms of angular frequency (since they have gamma*B terms, which would be in rad/s), the answer would be gamma B.",

So the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B = - \u03b3 S \u00b7 B. So when the field is in the Y direction, H is proportional to S_y. \n\nHowever, the energy levels depend on the eigenvalues of S_y multiplied by -\u03b3 B. \n\nThe energy eigenvalues were E_+ = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2 ), and E_- = \u03b3 B (\u0127/2 ). Thus, the energy difference between the two states is \u0394E = E_- - E_+ = \u03b3 B (\u0127/2 ) - (- \u03b3 B \u0127/2 ) = \u03b3 B \u0127. \n\nThe frequency associated with this energy difference is \u0394E/(h-bar) = \u03b3 B. Because \u0394E = h-bar * \u03c9_rad, so \u03c9_rad = \u0394E/(h-bar) = (\u03b3 B \u0127 )/\u0127 = \u03b3 B. \n\nAh, so the angular frequency is \u03c9_rad = \u03b3 B.",
          "text2": "Wait, let's recall that in the standard notation, the eigenstates of S_z are |+z\u27e9 = (1,0)^T and |-z\u27e9 = (0,1)^T. The eigenstates of S_y are different. \n\nBut let's proceed step by step. Let me write |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9 = (1, 0)^T (assuming units where \u0127 is 1 for simplicity, since we are dealing with frequencies which would depend on \u03b3 B / \u0127, but since the options are given in terms of gamma*B, maybe \u0127 is already accounted for in gamma? Hmm, the question defines mu as gamma*S_z. The standard formula for magnetic moment is \u03bc = \u03b3 S, where \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio, which has units of (rad/s)/(T), so that when multiplied by B (Tesla), gives rad/s. So in that case, perhaps gamma is already gamma/(\u0127), so that H = -\u03bc\u00b7B = -gamma S_z B. Therefore, the Hamiltonian H would have units of energy (since gamma has units of (rad/s)/(T), B in T, so gamma*B gives rad/s, but S_z has units of \u0127, so H would be -gamma * S_z * B, which would have units (rad/s * \u0127).",

So we need to find \u27e8Sz(t)\u27e9 as a function of time under the new Hamiltonian H_y, and then find the oscillation frequency of that.\n\nAlright, so let's model this. The initial state is |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9. The new Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B Sy. The time evolution of the state will be governed by H. Since H is time-independent after the switch, the state at time t is |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = exp(-i H t / \u0127) |\u03c8(0)\u27e9. \n\nBut first, let's note that Sy is the spin operator along y. The eigenvalues of Sy are \u00b1\u0127/2. But to compute the expectation value of Sz in the state evolving under H_y, we need to diagonalize the Hamiltonian.",
