Well, maybe the question expects the non-relativistic case. Let me note that.\n\nSo starting with \u0394p = \u0127/(2\u0394x). Let's compute that.

But let's see the second approach.\n\nSecond approach: Using \u0394t = \u0394x / v. So \u0394x is 0.1 nm = 1e-10 m, v is 2e8 m/s. So \u0394t = (1e-10 m)/(2e8 m/s) = 0.5e-18 seconds = 5e-19 s.\n\nThen \u0394E \u2265 \u0127/(2\u0394t) = (1.05e-34)/ (2 * 5e-19) ) = (1.05e-34)/(1e-18) ) = 1.05e-16 J.

But maybe we can approximate \u0394E \u2248 m*v*\u0394v. Since KE = 0.5 m v\u00b2, so d(KE)/dv = m v. So \u0394E \u2248 m*v*\u0394v. Which is same as before because \u0394v = \u0394p/m, so substituting gives m*v*(\u0394p/m) = v \u0394p. So same result. So that's consistent.\n\nSo again, the calculation gives ~1e-16 J, which is option D. But why is the option B 1e-17? Did I miscalculate?",

Well, maybe the question expects the non-relativistic case. Let me note that.\n\nSo starting with \u0394p = \u0127/(2\u0394x). Let's compute that.

Well, maybe the question expects the non-relativistic case. Let me note that.\n\nSo starting with \u0394p = \u0127/(2\u0394x). Let's compute that.

The uncertainty is \u0394E \u2248 (dE/dp) \u0394p. Since E is a function of p, the linear approximation. So the first method is correct. The second approach (using (\u0394p)^2/(2m)) would be wrong because that's the actual energy when p is \u0394p, but the uncertainty is not that. \n\nTherefore, the first approach is correct.",

Hmm, so now I get conflicting results. Which approach is correct?\n\nHmm, so this is a problem. I need to figure out why there's a discrepancy here. Let me think. The question is about the uncertainty in energy, which is \u0394E. The energy is (p^2)/(2m). The uncertainty could be calculated in two ways: either as the derivative (dE/dp)*\u0394p, or perhaps as (\u0394p)^2/(2m). Which is the right approach?",
