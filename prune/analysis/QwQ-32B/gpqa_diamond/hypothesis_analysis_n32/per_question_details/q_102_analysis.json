Let me check the options again:\n\nA) ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine would mean they act on different cells, but that wouldn't affect the expression of the eGFP in this context. \n\nB) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If it was stuck, maybe it wouldn't be on the cell surface, but the question is about the signal, perhaps because it's not expressed. \n\nC) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. The CBA promoter is a strong promoter, so maybe the enhancer isn't needed. \n\nD) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame. If the stop is there, then the eGFP isn't translated, so even if they were in frame, the stop would prevent it.",

But maybe the stop is still there, meaning the eGFP isn't translated at all, not just out of frame. Hmm. The eGFP would not be expressed. So the construct for the receptor has a stop between the receptor and eGFP. Unless the stop was removed, the eGFP is not translated. The Cre can only remove the ligand's stop (loxP-based), but the receptor's stop is in lox2272, so Cre can't remove that. So the stop remains, eGFP isn't made.

Therefore, the receptor isn't fused to GFP. So the answer would relate to why the eGFP isn't present, which is because the stop wasn't removed. \n\nLooking at the options again: option D suggests the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But that would be an issue if the stop was removed but the reading frames don't align. However, if the stop wasn't removed, then the eGFP isn't translated at all. The question's problem states that the antibodies were raised against overexpressed proteins, so maybe in the construct, when the stop is present, the receptor is expressed (so the antibody would detect it) but the GFP isn't. But when they look at the mouse, they don't see green (so no GFP), but maybe the receptor is present. However, the options don't mention the Cre not acting on the lox2272.

The DNA sequence would be: receptor's last codon ... stop (TAA) ... eGFP's first codon. When the stop is removed (the TAA is cut out), the receptor's last base is followed by the eGFP's start.

Therefore, the receptor's stop isn't removed. So the fusion between receptor and eGFP doesn't occur. Therefore, the eGFP isn't present. But the answer options don't mention the lox2272 issue. \n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recheck the question. The ligand's stop is in loxP-stop-loxP, so Cre can remove that, allowing ligand to be fused to mCherry. The receptor's stop is in lox2272-stop-lox2272. Since Cre can't cut lox2272, the stop remains, so the eGFP isn't fused. So the receptor is made, but no eGFP. Therefore, no green signal. But why is this an option? Let me check the options again. \n\nThe options are A to D. Option D is \"the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame\". That would be the case if the stop wasn't removed, so the eGFP is not part of the same reading frame. So the fusion isn't made, so the eGFP isn't expressed. Therefore, the correct reason is D?",
