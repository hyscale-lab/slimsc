Therefore, the mass dimension of the Dirac field must be such that each term has the same dimension. But how do we get the value? Let's see.\n\nThe Lagrangian for the Dirac field is L = \u03c8\u0304 (i \u03b3^\u03bc \u2202_\u03bc - m) \u03c8. The Lagrangian has dimension [mass]^4. Let's compute the dimensions of each part.

So Dirac spinor \u03c8 has mass dimension 3/2. \n\nNow F^{\u03bc\u03bd} \u2192 the electromagnetic field strength. Let's see, F_{\u03bc\u03bd} is \u2202_\u03bc A_\u03bd - \u2202_\u03bd A_\u03bc. The four-potential A_\u03bc has mass dimension? Let me see: the Lagrangian for the photon is -(1/4) F_{\u03bc\u03bd} F^{\u03bc\u03bd}. The F^2 term must have dimension 4, so each F has dimension 2. Since F_{\u03bc\u03bd} is made from derivatives of A, so each F_{\u03bc\u03bd} has dimension [\u2202_\u03bc A_\u03bd] = [\u2202] * [A], so if F has dimension 2, then [\u2202][A] =2. The derivative has dimension 1, so [A] = (2 -1) =1. So A has mass dimension 1. Therefore, F_{\u03bc\u03bd} has dimension 2. Since F^{\u03bc\u03bd} is just F_{\u03bc\u03bd} with raised indices, same dimension. \n\nSo F^{\u03bc\u03bd} has dimension 2. \n\nNow, putting this all together in the interaction term L_int = \u03ba (\u03c8\u0304 \u03c3_{\u03bc\u03bd} \u03c8) F^{\u03bc\u03bd}. \n\nLet me compute the mass dimension of each part. \n\nFirst, \u03c8\u0304 has 3/2, \u03c3_{\u03bc\u03bd} is dimensionless, \u03c8 has 3/2.

Let's see.\n\nThe Lagrangian for the Dirac field is L = \u03c8\u0304 (i \u03b3^\u03bc \u2202_\u03bc - m) \u03c8. The Lagrangian has dimension [mass]^4. Let's compute the dimensions of each part.

The four-potential A_\u03bc has mass dimension? Let me see: the Lagrangian for the photon is -(1/4) F_{\u03bc\u03bd} F^{\u03bc\u03bd}. The F^2 term must have dimension 4, so each F has dimension 2. Since F_{\u03bc\u03bd} is made from derivatives of A, so each F_{\u03bc\u03bd} has dimension [\u2202_\u03bc A_\u03bd] = [\u2202] * [A], so if F has dimension 2, then [\u2202][A] =2. The derivative has dimension 1, so [A] = (2 -1) =1. So A has mass dimension 1. Therefore, F_{\u03bc\u03bd} has dimension 2. Since F^{\u03bc\u03bd} is just F_{\u03bc\u03bd} with raised indices, same dimension. \n\nSo F^{\u03bc\u03bd} has dimension 2. \n\nNow, putting this all together in the interaction term L_int = \u03ba (\u03c8\u0304 \u03c3_{\u03bc\u03bd} \u03c8) F^{\u03bc\u03bd}. \n\nLet me compute the mass dimension of each part. \n\nFirst, \u03c8\u0304 has 3/2, \u03c3_{\u03bc\u03bd} is dimensionless, \u03c8 has 3/2.

Then \u03c3_{\u03bc\u03bd} is a combination of gamma matrices. The gamma matrices are dimensionless, so \u03c3_{\u03bc\u03bd} is also dimensionless. So the term \u03c8\u0304 \u03c3_{\u03bc\u03bd} \u03c8 has dimensions [3/2] + [3/2] = 3. Then multiplied by F^{\u03bc\u03bd}, which is dimension 2.

Let's compute the mass dimensions of each part.\n\nFirst, \u03c8\u0304 is a conjugate spinor, same dimension as \u03c8, so [\u03c8\u0304] = 3/2. Then \u03c3_{\u03bc\u03bd} is a combination of gamma matrices. The gamma matrices are dimensionless, so \u03c3_{\u03bc\u03bd} is also dimensionless. So the term \u03c8\u0304 \u03c3_{\u03bc\u03bd} \u03c8 has dimensions [3/2] + [3/2] = 3. Then multiplied by F^{\u03bc\u03bd}, which is dimension 2. So total for the product (\u03c8\u0304\u03c3\u03c8 F) is 3 +2 =5. \n\nThe entire Lagrangian term must have dimension 4, so \u03ba must supply the remaining dimension.
