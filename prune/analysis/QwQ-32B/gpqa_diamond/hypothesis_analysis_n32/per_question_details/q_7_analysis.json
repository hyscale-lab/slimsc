The total momentum vector would have components p1 and -p2. The total momentum squared would be (E1/c - E2/c)^2 c^2 = (E1 - E2)^2. So s becomes (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = 4 E1 E2. \n\nAh, that's right. So the invariant s = 4 E1 E2. The threshold condition requires s \u2265 (2 m_e c^2)^2.

The total momentum vector would have components p1 and -p2. The total momentum squared would be (E1/c - E2/c)^2 c^2 = (E1 - E2)^2. So s becomes (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = 4 E1 E2. \n\nAh, that's right. So the invariant s = 4 E1 E2. The threshold condition requires s \u2265 (2 m_e c^2)^2.
