The methyl group is already on the benzene. The nitration would occur where? The nitro group would be placed in the position directed by the methyl.

The methyl group is already on the benzene. The nitration would occur where? The nitro group would be placed in the position directed by the methyl.

So the nitro group is added to the benzene ring. Since toluene has a methyl group, the nitration occurs on the benzene ring at ortho or para positions relative to the methyl. The major product would be the para position, so product 1 is p-nitrotoluene.\n\nSecond step: product1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. MnO2 in H2SO4 is an oxidizing agent. The oxidation of a methyl group (on the benzene ring) would convert it to a carboxylic acid. So the methyl becomes a -COOH group.
