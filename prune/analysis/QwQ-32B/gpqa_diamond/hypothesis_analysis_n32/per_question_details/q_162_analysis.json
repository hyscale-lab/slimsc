Let r be the radial coordinate here (since x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = r\u00b2). In polar coordinates, dx dy = r dr d\u03b8. So substituting, the integral becomes the integral from \u03b8=0 to 2\u03c0, r from 0 to 2, of [32/(4 - r\u00b2)] * r dr d\u03b8. \n\nLet's compute that. The integral over \u03b8 is straightforward: 2\u03c0. Then the radial integral is \u222b\u2080\u00b2 [32/(4 - r\u00b2)] * r dr. Let me make a substitution. Let u =4 - r\u00b2. Then du/dr = -2r, so -du/2 = r dr. When r=0, u=4, and when r=2, u=0. So substituting, the integral becomes 32 * \u222b (from u=4 to u=0) (1/u) * (-du/2). The negative sign flips the limits, so it's 32*(1/2) \u222b\u2080\u2074 (1/u) du. That's 16 [ln u] from 0 to4.",
