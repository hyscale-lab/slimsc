That makes sense since the trace is zero (1 + (-1) +0 =0). Good.\n\nSo the possible eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1. The question asks for the probability of measuring 0. So I need the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0 and compute the squared norm of the projection of the state vector onto that eigenspace.\n\nTherefore, first step: find the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0. Let's do that.\n\nWe need to solve (P - 0I)v =0, so Pv =0.\n\nSo the matrix equation is:\n\n[ 0 1/\u221a2 0 ] [v1]   [0]\n[1/\u221a2 0 1/\u221a2] [v2] = [0]\n[ 0 1/\u221a2 0 ] [v3]   [0]\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nFirst equation: (0)v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)v2 =0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nSecond equation: (1/\u221a2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 =0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)(v1 + v3) =0 \u2192 v1 + v3 =0 \u2192 v3 = -v1.\n\nThird equation: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 +0*v3 =0 \u2192 same as first equation, which gives v2=0.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 must satisfy v2=0 and v3 = -v1. So the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, -v1), where v1 is any real number (or complex, but since the matrix is real and symmetric, we can consider real vectors). So the eigenvectors form a 1-dimensional subspace (since there are two equations reducing the variables).",

Let's set up (P -0*I) v =0 \u2192 Pv=0.\n\nSo solving P*v =0 where v is the eigenvector. Let me write the equations:\n\nP is the original matrix:\n\nRow1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0 \u2192 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 +0*v3 =0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)v2 =0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nRow2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)v1 +0*v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 =0 \u2192 (v1 +v3)/\u221a2 =0 \u2192 v1 + v3 =0.\n\nRow3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0 \u2192 same as first equation, gives v2=0 again.\n\nThus the equations are:\n\nv2 =0,\n\nv1 + v3 =0,\n\nand v2=0 (redundant).\n\nTherefore, the eigenvectors must satisfy v2=0 and v3 = -v1.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, -v1). Let me write this as v1*(1,0,-1) + v3*(0,0,1) but since v3 =-v1, so perhaps better to parametrize by v1. So the eigenvectors are multiples of (1, 0, -1). Because if v1 is a parameter, then choosing v1 =1 gives (1,0,-1), and v1= k gives (k,0,-k). \n\nThus the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is any scalar multiple of (1,0,-1). We can take the normalized eigenvector for projection. Let me compute the norm of (1,0,-1). The norm squared is 1\u00b2 +0 + (-1)^2 =2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2).",

Let's set up (P -0*I) v =0 \u2192 Pv=0.\n\nSo solving P*v =0 where v is the eigenvector. Let me write the equations:\n\nP is the original matrix:\n\nRow1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0 \u2192 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 +0*v3 =0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)v2 =0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nRow2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)v1 +0*v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 =0 \u2192 (v1 +v3)/\u221a2 =0 \u2192 v1 + v3 =0.\n\nRow3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0 \u2192 same as first equation, gives v2=0 again.\n\nThus the equations are:\n\nv2 =0,\n\nv1 + v3 =0,\n\nand v2=0 (redundant).\n\nTherefore, the eigenvectors must satisfy v2=0 and v3 = -v1.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, -v1).

Because if v1 is a parameter, then choosing v1 =1 gives (1,0,-1), and v1= k gives (k,0,-k). \n\nThus the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is any scalar multiple of (1,0,-1).
