Let's note that each of these has a cyclohexa-1,3-diene (so 6 carbons in the ring with two double bonds at 1 and 3). The 5 and 6 positions have methylene groups each with two bromines.

The carbocation attacks the carbon adjacent to the bromine in the bis(dibromomethyl) groups. Since each Br is a leaving group, the carbocation would form a bond with the carbon where the Br was.

Tert-butoxycarbonyl (t-Boc) is a common protecting group, and acid can remove it. But here it's a tert-butoxy group attached to the ring.

Let me see the reagents again.\n\nThe first reaction uses two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Let's note that each of these has a cyclohexa-1,3-diene (so 6 carbons in the ring with two double bonds at 1 and 3). The 5 and 6 positions have methylene groups each with two bromines. So each molecule has two -Br2CH2- groups. \n\nThe starting material is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene with a tert-butoxy at 7. \n\nIf the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the tert-butoxy leaves (as a leaving group), forming a carbocation at C7. The carbocation attacks the carbon adjacent to the bromine in the bis(dibromomethyl) groups. Since each Br is a leaving group, the carbocation would form a bond with the carbon where the Br was. So each Br would leave, and the C from the bicyclo becomes attached there. \n\nFor each Br in each bis(dibromomethyl), two Br per molecule, two molecules (since two equivalents), so total four Br substitutions. So each of the four Brs are replaced by the bicyclo ring's C7. \n\nThis would form a new bond between the bicyclo ring and each of the two cyclohexadiene rings.

Tert-butoxycarbonyl (t-Boc) is a common protecting group, and acid can remove it. But here it's a tert-butoxy group attached to the ring. If the tert-butyl is a protecting group for an alcohol, then acid might deprotect it. So maybe product 2 has hydroxyl groups where the tert-butoxy was. \n\nThen step 3: SO3 and pyridine in DMSO.

The reaction would remove the tert-butyl group and form an oxygen bridge between the two molecules.

The bromines on the methyl groups are leaving, allowing the carbocation to attack the carbon adjacent to the bromine. Since there are two equivalents of the second compound, two such substitutions occur, leading to two cyclohexadiene units attached to the bicyclo via oxygen linkages. So product 1 is the bicyclo with two cyclohexadiene rings attached via ether linkages at position 7.\n\nThen, when treated with H2SO4 (aq), maybe the cyclohexadiene rings undergo protonation and undergo a rearrangement or lose the oxygen linkages.

For instance, the tert-butoxy group departs as a leaving group, forming a carbocation at C7, which then attacks the carbon adjacent to the Br (since the Br is a good leaving group). The mechanism would be a nucleophilic substitution where Br leaves, and the carbocation attacks. Each dibromomethyl group has two Br atoms, so each can undergo substitution. Since there are two equivalents, two such substitutions would occur. This would attach the bicyclo ring to two different cyclohexadiene rings, forming a bridged system. \n\nProduct 1 would then have the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane connected to two cyclohexadiene rings via the former bromine positions. \n\nWhen product 1 is treated with H2SO4 (aqueous), maybe the double bonds are protonated, leading to some rearrangement or ring-opening.",
