If the process is active, like somatic hypermutation, that would cause mutations in the existing variable regions of the same B cell clones, leading to even more diversity. \n\nThe key here is that they are looking at the variable heavy chain genes. VDJ recombination creates diversity during B cell development, but once that's done, the gene is fixed. However, somatic hypermutation is an ongoing process where mutations are introduced in the variable regions of the antibody genes during an immune response, leading to more diversity.

The variable regions are formed by combining V, D, J genes, leading to a lot of diversity. But once that's done, the B cell is mature.
