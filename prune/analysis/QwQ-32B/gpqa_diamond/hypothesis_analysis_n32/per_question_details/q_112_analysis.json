The matrix becomes [[ -h/2, h/2], [h/2, -h/2]]. The equations are -h/2 v1 + h/2 v2 =0 \u2192 v1 = v2. So the eigenvector is proportional to (1,1). Similarly for \u03bb = -h/2, the eigenvector is (1,-1). \n\nTherefore, the eigenstates are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Let me denote them as |+> and |-> for simplicity. \n\nSo the two eigenstates are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/\u221a2 and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/\u221a2. \n\nNow, the probabilities that the system is in each of these eigenstates when measured are |<+|alpha>|\u00b2 and |<-|alpha>|\u00b2. \n\nSo let me compute these inner products. \n\nFirst, let's write |alpha> as:\n\n|alpha> = ( (1+i)/\u221a7 ) |up> + ( (2 - i)/\u221a7 ) |down>\n\nThen, the inner product <+|alpha> is:\n\n<+|alpha> = [ (1/\u221a2)<up| + (1/\u221a2)<down| ] * [ (1+i)/\u221a7 |up> + (2 -i)/\u221a7 |down> ]\n\nMultiplying out the terms:\n\n= (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a7) [ (1+i)<up|up> + (1+i)<up|down> + (2 -i)<down|up> + (2 -i)<down|down> ]\n\nBut since <up|up> =1, <down|down> =1, and the cross terms are zero, this simplifies to:\n\n= (1/(\u221a2 * \u221a7)) [ (1+i)*1 + (2 -i)*1 ]\n\nAdding the terms in the bracket:\n\n(1 + i +2 -i ) = 3. So the total is 3/(\u221a14)\n\nTherefore, <+|alpha> = 3/(\u221a14). The probability is |3/\u221a14|\u00b2 = 9/14 \u2248 0.642857...\n\nSimilarly, compute <-|alpha>:\n\n<-|alpha> = [ (1/\u221a2)<up| - (1/\u221a2)<down| ] * [ (1+i)/\u221a7 |up> + (2 -i)/\u221a7 |down> ]\n\nAgain, expanding:\n\n= (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a7) [ (1+i)<up|up> - (1+i)<up|down> + (2 -i)<down|up> - (2 -i)<down|down> ]\n\nAgain, cross terms are zero:\n\n= (1/(\u221a14)) [ (1+i)*1 - (2 -i)*1 ]\n\nCompute the bracket terms:\n\n(1 +i -2 +i) = (-1 + 2i). \n\nSo the inner product is (-1 + 2i)/\u221a14. The modulus squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 \u2248 0.357142...\n\nTherefore, the probabilities are approximately 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36).",
