The 6.7 ppm signals are in aromatic region (aromatic protons are usually from 6.5-8 ppm), so those are the aromatic protons.

So each ethyl has 2 carbons. So total carbons: 6 +2*2=10. Hydrogens: benzene has 6 H. Each ethyl group adds 5 H (since each ethyl is CH2CH3, which has 5 H).

Let me think:\n\nThe tetramethyl (1,2,3,5) would have methyl groups at 1,2,3,5. Let's see their environments again.

The methyls at 1 and 3 are each adjacent to one H (position 6 or 4) and one methyl. The methyl at position 5 is between two H's. \n\nSo the methyl groups would have three different environments:\n\n- The methyl at position 2: between two methyls (so more substituted).\n\n- The methyls at positions 1 and 3: each between a methyl and a H (so similar environment, so they are equivalent).\n\n- The methyl at position 5: between two H's (so less substituted).\n\nTherefore, the tetramethyl would have three methyl signals.

So both compounds in the mixture must each have only one aromatic signal (so when mixed, two signals total). \n\nThus, any mixture that includes a compound with two aromatic signals is invalid. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nThe diethylbenzene (option C's second compound) has two aromatic signals, so option C is out. \n\nNow, the remaining options are A, B, D. \n\nThe tetramethyl compounds all have one aromatic signal each, as previously analyzed. \n\nThus, any mixture of two tetramethylbenzenes will have two aromatic signals. \n\nNow, back to the alkyl signals. Let's reconsider:\n\nWe need the alkyl signals (at 2.2) to have a 2:1:1 ratio. \n\nThe two compounds each contribute their alkyl H. \n\nThe ratio must be three signals with 2:1:1. \n\nLet me consider option D: 1,2,4,5-tetra and 1,2,3,5-tetra.\n\nFirst compound (1,2,4,5-tetra):\n\nMethyl groups in two equivalent pairs, so two signals, each 6 H (since two methyl groups per pair).\n\nSecond compound (1,2,3,5-tetra):\n\nAs before, if it has three methyl signals (6,3,3), but then the total would have 2+3=5 signals. \n\nBut the required is three.",

So their environments are the same, so they form one singlet. \n\nThe diethylbenzene (1,4-diethyl) has two ethyl groups on 1 and 4. The aromatic H's are at positions 2,3,5,6. As I thought earlier, positions 2 and 6 are equivalent (symmetric across the 1-4 axis), and positions 3 and 5 are also equivalent. So two signals in the aromatic region. \n\nBut the mixture is a 1:1 of the two compounds. So combining the two compounds: \n\n- The tetramethyl contributes one aromatic singlet. \n\n- The diethyl contributes two aromatic singlets. \n\nTotal in the aromatic region would be three signals.

The aromatic region must have only two signals (from each compound contributing one). \n\nSo the diethylbenzene's two signals would combine with the tetramethyl's one, totaling three.

Right, so C10H14 is correct for tetramethylbenzene. Because each methyl substitution adds two H: 6 -1 (removed H) +3 (from methyl) = +2 each. So four substitutions: 6 + 4*2 = 14. So that's correct.

Therefore, the formula is C10H14. Because each methyl adds a carbon, so 4 carbons added to benzene's 6 gives 10, and hydrogens as above get to 14. \n\nAh! So my mistake earlier was miscalculating the hydrogens. So the tetramethylbenzenes are indeed C10H14. So that's okay. \n\nOkay, so now moving forward. \n\nNow, the NMR data: The 1H NMR spectrum has two signals at ~6.7 ppm (aromatic region) as singlets in a 1:1 ratio. The other signals are three singlets at 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. \n\nLet me think about each of the compounds in the options. Let's list all options again:\n\nOptions:\nA) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\nB) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\nC) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene\nD) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\n\nSo each option is a pair of compounds. Let's analyze each compound's NMR.\n\nFirst, let's consider the aromatic signals (6.7 ppm). Since all these compounds have tetramethyl groups except the diethyl one, which has two ethyl groups. \n\nFor the tetramethylbenzenes, each has four methyl groups and two aromatic H's. The position of the methyl groups will affect the environment of the remaining aromatic H's. \n\nLet me consider each compound's structure and the resulting NMR signals.\n\nStarting with 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:\n\nStructure: Methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4. The remaining H's are at positions 5 and 6. Let's consider their chemical environment. \n\nPosition 5 is between methyl-4 and H-6. Position 6 is between H-5 and methyl-1 (since position 1 is next to 6).",
          "text2": "Wait, maybe better to calculate each compound's formula:\n\nTake 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: the benzene ring has four methyl groups. The formula would be C6H6 minus H's from each substitution. Each methyl adds a CH3. So each substitution replaces a H with a CH3. So original benzene is 6 carbons, 6 hydrogens. Adding four methyl groups: each methyl adds 3 H, but each substitution removes one H from the ring. So total H is (6 -4) + 4*(3) = 2 +12=14. So yes, each of the tetramethylbenzenes would have C10H14 (since 6+4*1=10 C, and H: 6 -4 + 4*3 = 14). \n\nThe diethylbenzene: 1,4-diethylbenzene. Each ethyl group is C2H5. So, substituting two ethyl groups. Each substitution: replacing a H on benzene with an ethyl. So the formula would be C6H6 -2 H (because two substitutions) plus 2*(C2H5). So total carbons: 6 + 2*2 = 10. Hydrogens: (6-2) + 2*(5) = 4 +10 =14. Yep, so all the options have the correct molecular formula. \n\nNow, the NMR spectrum. The problem says the mixture is 1:1 of two compounds. The NMR shows two signals at around 6.7 ppm (aromatic protons) in a 1:1 ratio. And three signals at around 2.2 ppm (probably the methyl or ethyl groups) in a 2:1:1 ratio. \n\nFirst, let's think about the aromatic region. Since each compound has four methyl groups, except the diethyl which has two ethyl groups.",

So two signals for the methyl groups. \n\nSo this compound would have two methyl signals. \n\nNow the other compound in option D is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let's see its methyl groups. The substituents are at 1,2,3,5. Let's check their environments. \n\nMethyl at 1: adjacent to 2 (methyl) and 6 (H). \n\nMethyl at 2: adjacent to 1 (methyl) and 3 (methyl). \n\nMethyl at 3: adjacent to 2 (methyl) and 4 (H). \n\nMethyl at 5: adjacent to 4 (H) and 6 (H). \n\nSo the methyl at 2 is between two methyls, which is a different environment. The methyl at 5 is next to two H. The methyl at 1 and 3 are each adjacent to one methyl and one H. Are methyl at 1 and 3 equivalent? Let's see symmetry. \n\nThe substituents are on 1,2,3,5. The molecule might have a plane of symmetry through positions 2 and 5. For example, flipping over the axis between 2 and 5 would swap positions 1 and 3, and 4 and 6. So the methyl at 1 and 3 would be equivalent, and the H at 4 and 6 would be equivalent. \n\nSo methyl at 1 and 3 are in the same environment. Methyl at 2 is in a unique environment (between two methyls), and methyl at 5 is between two H. \n\nThus, this compound would have three types of methyl groups. \n\nTherefore, combining both compounds in option D (1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,5), the total methyl signals would be: \n\n1,2,4,5: two methyl types (from positions 1,5 and 2,4). \n\n1,2,3,5: three methyl types (positions 1/3, 2, and 5). \n\nCombined, how many signals? Let's see:\n\nFrom 1,2,4,5: two methyl signals (let's say at a and b). \n\nFrom 1,2,3,5: three signals (c, d, e). \n\nSo total would be five signals? But the problem says three signals at 2.2 ppm. Hmm. That complicates things.",
          "text2": "Wait, positions 5 and 6 are H. So the methyls at 1 and4 are each adjacent to one H (positions6 and5 respectively) and one methyl (position2 and3 respectively). The methyls at positions2 and3 are between two methyls. \n\nSo the methyl at position1 and4 have the same environment (each has one H neighbor and one methyl neighbor). The methyls at 2 and3 are between two methyls, so their environment is different. So there are two types of methyl groups here: the ones at positions1 and4 (equivalent) and those at 2 and3 (equivalent). So two signals from this compound.\n\nThe second compound in option A is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let's see their methyl groups:\n\nPositions1,2,3,5 have methyls. \n\nPosition1: adjacent to 2 (methyl) and 6 (H).\n\nPosition2: between 1 and3 (both methyl).\n\nPosition3: between 2 (methyl) and4 (H).\n\nPosition5: between4 (H) and6 (H), and also next to 4 and6 which are H. \n\nSo:\n\nMethyl at position1: adjacent to H (position6) and methyl (position2).\n\nMethyl at position2: between two methyls (1 and3).\n\nMethyl at position3: adjacent to methyl (position2) and H (position4).\n\nMethyl at position5: adjacent to H (positions4 and6). \n\nSo the methyl at position5 has two H neighbors. The methyls at 1 and3 each have one H neighbor and one methyl. The methyl at2 is between two methyls. \n\nThus, the methyls at1 and3 are equivalent? Let's see:\n\nPosition1 and3 are symmetric with respect to the ring? For example, if you rotate the molecule, position1 and3 might not be symmetric. Hmm. Let's think of the positions:\n\nPositions are numbered 1-6 clockwise. \n\n1,2,3,5:\n\nThe methyls are at 1,2,3,5. The H's are at4 and6. \n\nPosition1: between 6 and2 (both methyl?",

Thus, each would give one singlet (if symmetric), so two singlets in total, which matches the 1:1 ratio (since each is in 1:1 mixture).\n\nNow the non-aromatic signals. Let's see the total protons in the 2.2 ppm region. Since each tetramethyl has four methyl groups (12 H), and the diethyl has two ethyl groups (each CH2 and CH3: total 10 H). \n\nThe problem states three signals at 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. The total area would be 2+1+1=4 parts, but since each part is a number of H, but the ratio is between the signals. \n\nLet me think for option D:\n\nFirst compound: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. If it has two types of methyl groups (each pair), then each pair has two methyl groups (so 6 H each?), no.",

Not matching. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me try option C again: 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl and 1,4-diethylbenzene. \n\nFirst, the tetramethyl's methyl groups give three signals (as earlier). \n\nThe diethylbenzene: \n\nEach ethyl group is -CH2CH3. Since it's 1,4-diethyl, the two ethyl groups are on positions 1 and 4 of the benzene (or symmetrically placed). \n\nThe CH2 groups attached to the ring would be in the same environment (since the molecule is symmetric). So their protons would be a single singlet. The CH3 groups of the ethyl groups are also in the same environment (since the two ethyl groups are equivalent). So the diethyl would contribute two signals: one for the CH2 (at ~2.5 ppm?), and one for the CH3 (at ~1 ppm). \n\nBut the problem states that all alkyl signals are at ~2.2 ppm. The CH3 would be at lower ppm, so they wouldn't be part of the three signals. Therefore, only the CH2 would be at ~2.5 ppm, but the problem says three signals at 2.2. So this doesn't fit unless the CH2 is around 2.2.",
          "text2": "Wait, position5's methyl is between4 (H) and6 (H). \n\nSo:\n\n- Position2's methyl is between two methyls (positions1 and3). \n\n- Positions1 and3's methyls are each between a methyl and an H. \n\n- Position5's methyl is between two H's. \n\nTherefore:\n\nThe methyl at position2 (two adjacent methyls) \u2192 one environment. \n\nPositions1 and3 (each adjacent to one methyl and one H) \u2192 another environment. \n\nPosition5 (two adjacent H's) \u2192 third environment. \n\nTherefore, three signals from methyl groups. \n\nSo the total for option D's mixture would be 1 (from first compound) +3 (second) =4 signals. But the question states three signals. \n\nHmm, that's a problem. Maybe I messed up another option. Let's check option B: \n\nOption B is 1,2,4,5-tetra and 1,2,3,4-tetra. \n\nFirst, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. \n\nThe methyl groups are at positions1-4. \n\nEach methyl's environment: \n\nPosition1: adjacent to2 (methyl) and6 (H). \n\nPosition2: adjacent to1 (methyl) and3 (methyl). \n\nPosition3: adjacent to2 (methyl) and4 (methyl). \n\nPosition4: adjacent to3 (methyl) and5 (H). \n\nSo:\n\nPosition2 and3 are between two methyls. \n\nPositions1 and4 are between a methyl and a H. \n\nThus, the methyl groups at positions2 and3 are in one environment, and positions1 and4 are in another. \n\nThus, two methyl signals. \n\nThe other compound in option B is 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl (which we said has one methyl signal). \n\nThus total methyl signals in mixture would be 2+1=3.

Let's check its formula. An ethyl group is -CH2CH3. Two ethyl groups would add 2*(2 carbons) so the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 2*2 = 10. Hydrogens: original H is 6 on benzene. Each ethyl group has 5 H (since each ethyl is -CH2CH3, which has 5 H total). But each ethyl substitutes a hydrogen on benzene. So total H: 6 -2 (for substitution) + 2*(5) H. That's 6-2=4, plus 10 gives 14 H. So yes, C10H14 as well. So all the options given are possible.\n\nNow, the NMR data. The question says the mixture is 1:1 of two compounds. Each compound contributes to the NMR signals. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, each compound's signals would be present in the spectrum, but their integrals (area ratios) would add up.

Each ethyl group adds 2 carbons (so two ethyl groups add 4 carbons to the benzene, making 6+4=10 C, which is correct). Now, H calculation: Each ethyl group has 5 H (since CH2CH3 has 5 H). Each ethyl group replaces one H on the benzene. So for each ethyl group, the substitution: instead of one H, we have the ethyl group. So each ethyl group adds (5 H) but subtracts 1 H from the benzene. So each ethyl group contributes 5-1 =4 H. Two ethyl groups contribute 8 H. The benzene had 6 H, so total H = 6 -2 (since two H were replaced) plus the ethyl groups' 5*2=10 H?",
          "text2": "Wait, benzene is C6H6. Adding four methyl groups (each -CH3) would replace four H on benzene. So total H would be 6 (original) minus 4 (replaced) plus 4*3 (from methyls) = 6-4=2 +12 =14. Ah, that's right. So each tetramethylbenzene would have 14 H. So that's consistent with C10H14. The diethylbenzene: 1,4-diethylbenzene would have two ethyl groups. Each ethyl is -CH2CH3. So each ethyl adds 2 carbons and 5 hydrogens (since each ethyl has 5 H: 2+3). So total carbons: 6 + 2*2 = 10. Hydrogens: original 6 H on benzene minus 2 (since each ethyl replaces one H) = 4. Then adding the ethyls: 2*(2+3) H?",

Right, so C10H14 is correct for tetramethylbenzene. Because each methyl substitution adds two H: 6 -1 (removed H) +3 (from methyl) = +2 each. So four substitutions: 6 + 4*2 = 14. So that's correct.

          "text1": "Wait a second. I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate properly:\n\nEach methyl group is added to the benzene, so each takes the place of a hydrogen. So for each methyl group, the number of hydrogens is: benzene has 6 H. Each substituent (like a methyl) replaces one H with the substituent. So each methyl adds (CH3) so the substituent contributes 3 H, but subtracts 1 H (the one it replaced). So total H per methyl is +2 H. \n\nSo for four methyl groups:\n\nTotal H = 6 (original) +4*(3 H from methyl -1 H lost) =6 +4*(2)=6+8=14. Oh! So tetramethylbenzene would have 14 H! Therefore, the formula is C10H14. Because each methyl adds a carbon, so 4 carbons added to benzene's 6 gives 10, and hydrogens as above get to 14. \n\nAh! So my mistake earlier was miscalculating the hydrogens. So the tetramethylbenzenes are indeed C10H14. So that's okay. \n\nOkay, so now moving forward. \n\nNow, the NMR data: The 1H NMR spectrum has two signals at ~6.7 ppm (aromatic region) as singlets in a 1:1 ratio. The other signals are three singlets at 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. \n\nLet me think about each of the compounds in the options. Let's list all options again:\n\nOptions:\nA) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\nB) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\nC) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene\nD) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\n\nSo each option is a pair of compounds. Let's analyze each compound's NMR.\n\nFirst, let's consider the aromatic signals (6.7 ppm). Since all these compounds have tetramethyl groups except the diethyl one, which has two ethyl groups. \n\nFor the tetramethylbenzenes, each has four methyl groups and two aromatic H's. The position of the methyl groups will affect the environment of the remaining aromatic H's. \n\nLet me consider each compound's structure and the resulting NMR signals.\n\nStarting with 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:\n\nStructure: Methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4. The remaining H's are at positions 5 and 6. Let's consider their chemical environment. \n\nPosition 5 is between methyl-4 and H-6. Position 6 is between H-5 and methyl-1 (since position 1 is next to 6).",
          "text2": "Wait, maybe better to calculate each compound's formula:\n\nTake 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: the benzene ring has four methyl groups. The formula would be C6H6 minus H's from each substitution. Each methyl adds a CH3. So each substitution replaces a H with a CH3. So original benzene is 6 carbons, 6 hydrogens. Adding four methyl groups: each methyl adds 3 H, but each substitution removes one H from the ring. So total H is (6 -4) + 4*(3) = 2 +12=14. So yes, each of the tetramethylbenzenes would have C10H14 (since 6+4*1=10 C, and H: 6 -4 + 4*3 = 14). \n\nThe diethylbenzene: 1,4-diethylbenzene. Each ethyl group is C2H5. So, substituting two ethyl groups. Each substitution: replacing a H on benzene with an ethyl. So the formula would be C6H6 -2 H (because two substitutions) plus 2*(C2H5). So total carbons: 6 + 2*2 = 10. Hydrogens: (6-2) + 2*(5) = 4 +10 =14. Yep, so all the options have the correct molecular formula. \n\nNow, the NMR spectrum. The problem says the mixture is 1:1 of two compounds. The NMR shows two signals at around 6.7 ppm (aromatic protons) in a 1:1 ratio. And three signals at around 2.2 ppm (probably the methyl or ethyl groups) in a 2:1:1 ratio. \n\nFirst, let's think about the aromatic region.

Each methyl's environment. Let me see if they are all equivalent. \n\nPositions 1 and5 are para (separated by three carbons?), so maybe symmetric. \n\nDue to the symmetry (the molecule has a plane through positions3 and6), the methyls at1 and5 are equivalent. Similarly, positions2 and4 are equivalent. So the methyl groups are in two equivalence classes. So their protons would have two signals. Each methyl group's three H would give a singlet. So this compound would have two methyl signals (each at different ppm), say, for example, two signals at ~2.2 and ~2.3 ppm. \n\nThe other compound is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let's see its methyl groups' environment. The methyls are at 1,2,3,5. \n\nThe symmetry here: positions1 and3 are adjacent. Let me think about their equivalence. Let's see if the molecule has any symmetry. If we have methyls at 1,2,3,5, then the remaining H are at4 and6 (which are equivalent as before). The methyl groups at positions1,2,3,5. \n\nLooking for symmetry planes: perhaps a mirror plane through positions4 and6. Then, position1 would be opposite to position4 (H), but position5 is adjacent to position4. Hmm, perhaps the methyl groups at 1,2,3 form a cluster, making their environments different from position5.",

Let me calculate the molecular formula for tetramethylbenzene. \n\nThe general formula for benzene is C6H6. Each methyl group is -CH3, so each adds a CH3. So replacing four H's on benzene with methyl groups would give C6H6 - 4H (since each substitution removes one H) plus 4*(CH3). So each methyl adds 3 H's but replaces one H. So each methyl adds 2 H: because the methyl group is -CH3, so each substitution adds 3 H but removes one, so net +2 per methyl. So four methyl groups would add 4*(2) = 8 H. Original benzene has 6 H, so total H would be 6 -4 (since each substitution removes one H) + 4*(3) (the H from the methyls). Let me do it step by step.\n\nOriginal benzene has 6 H. Each methyl group replaces one H with a CH3. So each methyl adds 3 H (since CH3 has 3 H, but replacing one H from benzene). So for each methyl: 3 H added, minus the one H removed. Net gain of 2 H per methyl. Four methyl groups: 4*2=8 added. So total H would be 6 (original) -4 (the four H removed) + 4*3 (H from methyls) = 6 -4 +12 = 14. So the formula for tetramethylbenzene is C10H14. That matches. \n\nThe other option is 1,4-diethylbenzene. Let's see its formula. Each ethyl group is -CH2CH3. So two ethyl groups would add 2*(2 carbons) = 4 carbons. So benzene (6) plus 4 gives 10 carbons, so also C10H? Let's see the H count. Each ethyl group has 5 H (since ethyl is CH2CH3: two CH2 and one CH3?",

So the molecular formula for tetramethylbenzene is C10H14 (since 6 +4=10 C and 2 +12=14 H). So that's correct. So all three tetramethylbenzene options have C10H14. The fourth option is 1,4-diethylbenzene. Let's see: each ethyl group is -CH2CH3. So two ethyl groups: so the formula would be C6H5(CH2CH3)2. Let's calculate: 6 carbons from benzene, plus 2*(2) =4 from ethyls, total 10 C. Hydrogens: benzene has 5 H left (since two positions are substituted).

Each ethyl group contributes 5 H (since -CH2CH3 has 5 H: the two CH2's H and the CH3's H, but the CH2 is attached to the benzene). So each ethyl adds 5 H but subtracts 1 H from benzene.
