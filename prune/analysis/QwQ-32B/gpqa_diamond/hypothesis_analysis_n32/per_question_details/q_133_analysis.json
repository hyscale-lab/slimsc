Since the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the salts, maybe I can model this using the equilibrium expressions.

The log of that is log(0.765). Let me compute that. \n\nLog(0.765): log(7.65x10^-1) \u2248 log(7.65) -1. Since log(7.65) is about 0.8837, so 0.8837 -1 = -0.1163. So the pH is 7.208 -0.116 \u2248 7.092. \n\nSo the pH is approximately 7.092. \n\nTherefore, the H+ concentration is 10^-pH = 10^-7.092 \u2248 8.05e-8 M. Let me confirm that calculation. 10^-7 is 1e-7, 10^-0.092 is about 0.805 (since 10^-0.1 is ~0.8). So 1e-7 * 0.805 \u2248 8.05e-8 M. \n\nNow, going back to the third dissociation (Ka3 = 1.8e-12):\n\nKa3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can rearrange to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nWe have [HPO4^2-] as 0.02809 M (from the solution), and [H+] is 8.05e-8. \n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.05e-8)\n\nLet me compute numerator first: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 \u2248 5.056e-14. \n\nThen denominator is 8.05e-8. \n\nSo 5.056e-14 / 8.05e-8 \u2248 (5.056 /8.05) * 1e-6 \u2248 approximately 0.628 * 1e-6 = 6.28e-7 M. \n\nHmm, that's close to option A which is 6.24e-7.

The difference in log is (-0.1135) - (-0.1192) = +0.0057 per 0.01 increase.\n\n0.765 is 0.76 +0.005. So 0.005/0.01 is 0.5. So the log would be -0.1192 +0.5*0.0057 = -0.1192 +0.00285 \u2248 -0.11635. \n\nSo log(0.765)\u2248-0.1164.\n\nThus pH =7.208 (pKa2) + (-0.1164) = 7.208 -0.1164 = 7.0916. So pH\u22487.0916.\n\nThen, [H+] =10^-7.0916.\n\nLet me compute this more precisely. Let me write 10^-7.0916 = 10^(-7 -0.0916) =10^-7 *10^-0.0916.\n\nCompute 10^-0.0916:\n\nTake natural log: ln(10^-0.0916) = -0.0916 *ln(10) \u2248-0.0916 *2.302585 \u2248-0.2109.\n\nSo exp(-0.2109) = e^-0.2109 \u2248 ?\n\ne^-0.2 = 0.8187, e^-0.21 = approx 0.81 (since e^-0.21 is about 0.81).

Since each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-, the concentration of H2PO4^- from this is 0.03673 M.\n\nNow Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: moles = 1.00 / 177.99 \u2248 0.005616 mol. So concentration is 0.005616 / 0.2 \u2248 0.02808 M. Each mole of this gives one mole of HPO4^2-, so HPO4^2- concentration from this is 0.02808 M.",

The other one, Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O, when dissolved, gives Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. \n\nThe question is about orthophosphate ions, which would be PO4^3-. But how does that form here? The HPO4^2- can deprotonate to form PO4^3- if the pH is high enough. However, since we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution, this is a buffer system. The pH here would be determined by the ratio of these two species. \n\nThe orthophosphate concentration would depend on the extent to which HPO4^2- loses another proton. Since we have the Ka values given, maybe we can use the relevant Ka to find the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nLooking at the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is for the first dissociation H3PO4 \u2192 H+ + H2PO4^-, Ka2 is H2PO4^- \u2192 H+ + HPO4^2-, and Ka3 is HPO4^2- \u2192 H+ + PO4^3-.

That's really small, meaning that HPO4^2- is a weak acid and doesn't dissociate much into PO4^3- and H+.\n\nTherefore, the concentration of PO4^3- would be very small, governed by Ka3. To find that, we can consider the equilibrium of HPO4^2- dissociating into H+ and PO4^3-.\n\nBut first, we need to know the pH of the solution because the pH will affect how much HPO4^2- deprotonates. Since the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the pH is determined by the ratio of their concentrations. \n\nLet me recall the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Since pH is approx 7.09, then [H+] = 10^-7.09 \u2248 8.13e-8 M.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.13e-8)\n\nLet me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst, numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 \u2248 1.8 * 0.02809 = ~0.050562, so 0.050562e-12 = 5.0562e-14.\n\nThen divide by 8.13e-8:\n\n5.0562e-14 /8.13e-8 = (5.0562 /8.13) * 1e-6 \u2248 0.6217 * 1e-6 \u2248 6.217e-7 M. \n\nHmm, that number is close to option A (6.24e-7) but not exactly.",

Let's do exact division:\n\n1.00 / 177.99 = approximately 0.005616 mol.\n\nSo 0.005616 /0.2 =0.02808 M.\n\npH calculation:\n\npKa2 is -log(6.2e-8). Let me compute that precisely.\n\nlog(6.2)=0.79239. So pKa2=7.2076.\n\nThe ratio: [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] =0.02808/0.03673=0.7640.\n\nlog(0.764) = ln(0.764)/ln(10). Let me compute ln(0.764)= -0.2685, so divided by 2.3026 gives -0.1166.\n\nSo pH=7.2076 -0.1166 =7.091.\n\n[H+]=10^-7.091. Let me calculate that precisely:\n\nAntilog of -7.091: 10^-7 * 10^-0.091.\n\n10^-0.091: since 10^-0.1 is ~0.794, so 10^-0.091 \u22480.807 (since 0.091 is 0.1-0.009, so approximate). Let me use calculator-like steps:\n\nLet me take natural logs:\n\nln(10^-0.091)= -0.091 * ln(10) \u2248 -0.091*2.3026\u2248-0.2095, so e^-0.2095\u22480.811. So 10^-0.091 \u22480.811, so [H+]=8.11e-8.\n\nSo [H+]=8.11e-8.\n\nNow, the calculation for PO4^3-:\n\nKa3=1.8e-12 = ([H+][PO4^3-])/[HPO4^2-]\n\nSolving for [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+]\n\nPlugging in:\n\n(1.8e-12 * 0.02808 ) / 8.11e-8.\n\nFirst multiply numerator: 1.8 * 0.02808 = 0.050544, so 0.050544e-12.\n\nDivide by 8.11e-8:\n\n0.050544e-12 /8.11e-8 = (0.050544/8.11)*1e-4.\n\n0.050544 divided by 8.11:\n\n0.050544 /8 = 0.006318, but 8.11 is a bit more. 8.11 * 0.00623 = 0.0505 (since 8*0.00623=0.04984, and 0.11 *0.00623=0.000685, total 0.0505). So 0.00623. So the result is 0.00623 x1e-4?",
          "text2": "Wait, actually:\n\n1.00g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007344 mol.

So about 0.005618 mol.\n\nSo both salts contribute their respective ions. KH2PO4 gives H2PO4^- and K+, while the sodium one gives Na+ and HPO4^2- (since it's Na2HPO4).\n\nSo, the concentration of H2PO4^- is (0.00734 mol) / 0.2 L = 0.0367 M.\n\nThe concentration of HPO4^2- is (0.005618 mol) / 0.2 L = 0.02809 M.\n\nNow, since these are the main species, the pH of the solution would be around the pKa2 because they form a buffer.

The given options are:\n\nA) 6.24x10^-7 M\n\nB)5.48x10^-7 M \n\nC)2.81x10^-7 M\n\nD)3.97x10^-7 M \n\nSo my calculation gives 6.22e-7, which is very close to option A. The slight difference could be due to more precise calculations. Let me try using more precise numbers.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\nFirst, compute pKa2:\n\nKa2 =6.2e-8 \u2192 pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8).\n\nCalculating log(6.2):\n\nlog(6)=0.7782, log(6.2)=?\n\nlog(6.2)=log(6)+log(1.03333)=0.7782 +0.0144\u22480.7926. So pKa2=8 -0.7926=7.2074.\n\nThen the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]= (0.02808)/(0.03673)= \n\nLet me compute 0.02808 divided by 0.03673:\n\n0.02808 /0.03673 \u2248 0.7643. \n\nlog(0.7643)= \n\nln(0.7643)= -0.268, but in base 10. Let me compute log(0.7643):\n\nWe know that log(0.76)= approx. Let me think. log(7.6*10^-1). \n\nlog(7.6)=0.8808, so log(0.76)=0.8808-1= -0.1192. \n\nBut 0.7643 is a bit more than 0.76, so the log would be slightly higher (less negative). \n\nThe difference between 0.76 and 0.7643 is 0.0043. Let me use linear approximation. \n\nThe derivative of log(x) at x=0.76 is 1/(x ln10) \u22481/(0.76*2.3026) \u2248 0.575 per 1. \n\nSo delta_x =0.0043. The change in log would be approx (delta_x)/(x ln10) \u2192 0.0043/(0.76*2.3026) \u2248 0.0043/(1.75) \u22480.00245. \n\nSo log(0.7643) \u2248 -0.1192 +0.00245 \u2248-0.1168. So log is about -0.1168. \n\nThus pH =7.2074 -0.1168 =7.0906. \n\nSo [H+] =10^-7.0906. Let me compute that more precisely. \n\n7.0906 pH \u2192 [H+] = 1e-7.0906. \n\nUsing a calculator, 10^-7.0906 = ?\n\nLet me compute 10^-7.0906 = 10^(-7 -0.0906) =10^-7 *10^-0.0906. \n\n10^-0.0906: \n\nWe know 10^-0.09 = ~0.8123 (since 10^-0.09 \u2248 e^(-0.09*ln10) \u2248 e^-0.207 \u22480.813). \n\n0.0906 is 0.09 +0.0006. So 10^-0.0906 = 10^-0.09 *10^-0.0006 \u2248 0.8123 * (1 -0.0006*ln10) \u22480.8123 *0.9996\u22480.812. \n\nThus, [H+] \u22488.12e-8 M. \n\nNow, plug into the formula: \n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02808)/(8.12e-8). \n\nFirst multiply numerator:\n\n1.8e-12 *0.02808 = \n\n0.02808 *1.8 = 0.050544 \u2192 0.050544e-12 =5.0544e-14. \n\nDivide by 8.12e-8:\n\n5.0544e-14 /8.12e-8 = (5.0544/8.12) *1e-6. \n\n5.0544 divided by8.12:\n\nLet me compute this division precisely. \n\n8.12 *0.62 =5.0344. \n\nSo 5.0544-5.0344=0.02. \n\nSo remaining 0.02 /8.12 \u22480.00246. \n\nTotal is 0.62 +0.00246 \u22480.62246. \n\nThus, 0.62246 *1e-6 =6.2246e-7. \n\nSo that's 6.22e-7, very close to option A's 6.24e-7. The slight difference might be due to more precise values of the constants.",
          "text2": "Another point: when using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, are we considering the ratio correctly? The equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the base is HPO4^2- and the acid is H2PO4^-, so that part is correct. \n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct, leading to approximately 6.25e-7, which is very close to option A's 6.24e-7. Maybe the slight difference comes from more precise pKa2 calculation. Let me check the exact pKa2 again.\n\nKa2 is 6.2e-8. pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8).\n\nLet me compute log(6.2). Log(6) is 0.7782, log(6.2) is a bit higher. Let's do it precisely:\n\nlog(6.2) = log(6) + log(1.0333). Since 6*1.0333 =6.2.\n\nlog(1.0333) \u22480.0142 (since ln(1.0333) \u22480.0327, so log=0.0327/2.3026\u22480.0142). So total log(6.2)=0.7782 +0.0142=0.7924. \n\nSo pKa2 is 8 -0.7924 =7.2076. So 7.2076. \n\nSo pH =7.2076 -0.116 (from the log term) =7.0916.\n\nThus, pH is 7.0916. \n\n[H+] is 10^-7.0916. Let me compute this more accurately. \n\nLet me use natural logarithm for better precision. \n\nLet me take 10^(-7.0916) = e^(-7.0916 * ln(10)). ln(10)=2.302585093.\n\nSo exponent is -7.0916 *2.302585 \u2248-7.0916*2.302585. Let's compute:\n\n7 *2.302585 =16.1181, 0.0916 *2.302585 \u22480.2109. Total exponent is - (16.1181+0.2109)= -16.329.\n\nThus, e^-16.329.",

Its molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. Moles = mass/molar mass = 1.00 / 136.09 \u2248 0.007346 mol.\n\nSimilarly, the mass of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is 1.00 g. Its molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 \u2248 0.005616 mol.\n\nThe total volume is 200.00 cm\u00b3 = 0.2 L.\n\nSo concentration of KH2PO4 (H2PO4^-) is 0.007346 / 0.2 = 0.03673 M.\n\nConcentration of Na2HPO4 (HPO4^2-) is 0.005616 / 0.2 = 0.02808 M.\n\nSo the solution is a buffer with these two species.

Let me interpolate.\n\nBetween log(7.6)=0.8808, log(7.7)=0.8865.\n\nThe difference between 7.6 and 7.7 is 0.1 in the number, and 0.0057 in log.\n\nSo 7.64 is 0.04 above 7.6.

Let me compute log(0.7643):\n\nWe know that log(0.76)= approx. Let me think. log(7.6*10^-1). \n\nlog(7.6)=0.8808, so log(0.76)=0.8808-1= -0.1192. \n\nBut 0.7643 is a bit more than 0.76, so the log would be slightly higher (less negative). \n\nThe difference between 0.76 and 0.7643 is 0.0043. Let me use linear approximation. \n\nThe derivative of log(x) at x=0.76 is 1/(x ln10) \u22481/(0.76*2.3026) \u2248 0.575 per 1. \n\nSo delta_x =0.0043. The change in log would be approx (delta_x)/(x ln10) \u2192 0.0043/(0.76*2.3026) \u2248 0.0043/(1.75) \u22480.00245. \n\nSo log(0.7643) \u2248 -0.1192 +0.00245 \u2248-0.1168. So log is about -0.1168. \n\nThus pH =7.2074 -0.1168 =7.0906. \n\nSo [H+] =10^-7.0906. Let me compute that more precisely. \n\n7.0906 pH \u2192 [H+] = 1e-7.0906. \n\nUsing a calculator, 10^-7.0906 = ?\n\nLet me compute 10^-7.0906 = 10^(-7 -0.0906) =10^-7 *10^-0.0906. \n\n10^-0.0906: \n\nWe know 10^-0.09 = ~0.8123 (since 10^-0.09 \u2248 e^(-0.09*ln10) \u2248 e^-0.207 \u22480.813). \n\n0.0906 is 0.09 +0.0006. So 10^-0.0906 = 10^-0.09 *10^-0.0006 \u2248 0.8123 * (1 -0.0006*ln10) \u22480.8123 *0.9996\u22480.812. \n\nThus, [H+] \u22488.12e-8 M. \n\nNow, plug into the formula: \n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02808)/(8.12e-8). \n\nFirst multiply numerator:\n\n1.8e-12 *0.02808 = \n\n0.02808 *1.8 = 0.050544 \u2192 0.050544e-12 =5.0544e-14. \n\nDivide by 8.12e-8:\n\n5.0544e-14 /8.12e-8 = (5.0544/8.12) *1e-6. \n\n5.0544 divided by8.12:\n\nLet me compute this division precisely. \n\n8.12 *0.62 =5.0344. \n\nSo 5.0544-5.0344=0.02. \n\nSo remaining 0.02 /8.12 \u22480.00246. \n\nTotal is 0.62 +0.00246 \u22480.62246. \n\nThus, 0.62246 *1e-6 =6.2246e-7. \n\nSo that's 6.22e-7, very close to option A's 6.24e-7.

Maybe the slight difference comes from more precise pKa2 calculation. Let me check the exact pKa2 again.\n\nKa2 is 6.2e-8. pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8).\n\nLet me compute log(6.2). Log(6) is 0.7782, log(6.2) is a bit higher. Let's do it precisely:\n\nlog(6.2) = log(6) + log(1.0333). Since 6*1.0333 =6.2.\n\nlog(1.0333) \u22480.0142 (since ln(1.0333) \u22480.0327, so log=0.0327/2.3026\u22480.0142). So total log(6.2)=0.7782 +0.0142=0.7924. \n\nSo pKa2 is 8 -0.7924 =7.2076. So 7.2076. \n\nSo pH =7.2076 -0.116 (from the log term) =7.0916.\n\nThus, pH is 7.0916. \n\n[H+] is 10^-7.0916.
