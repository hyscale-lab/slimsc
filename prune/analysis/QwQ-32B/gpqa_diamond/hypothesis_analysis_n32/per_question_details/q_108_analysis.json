Since the orbital magnetic quantum number m is small, perhaps m is near zero? Because the question mentions \"small values of m\". The expectation value of L_z in a state with m is m\u0127. So \u27e8H\u27e9 would be - (\u03bc_B / \u0127) * B * m \u0127 = - \u03bc_B B m.

Since m is small, maybe like 1 or 2. The Bohr magneton is approximately 9.27e-24 J/T. Multiply by m (say 1) and B=1 T, so the energy would be ~9e-24 J. Let's convert that to electron volts to compare with the hydrogen transition energy. 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 J, so 9e-24 J is 9e-24 / 1.6e-19 \u2248 5.6e-5 eV. That's a very small energy.\n\nNow the transition energy \u0394E for hydrogen. Let's compute that using the given wavelength. The transition energy is \u0394E = hc/\u03bb. Let's plug in the numbers. h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s, c is 3e8 m/s, \u03bb is 0.4861 micrometers which is 4.861e-7 meters.\n\nCalculating hc/\u03bb: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 / 4.861e-7 = let's compute that step by step. \n\nFirst 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m. Then divide by 4.861e-7 m gives 1.9878e-25 /4.861e-7 \u2248 4.09e-19 J. Converting to eV: 4.09e-19 / 1.6e-19 \u2248 ~2.56 eV. So the transition energy is about 2.5 eV. \n\nComparing the two: the paramagnetic term is ~5.6e-5 eV versus the transition energy of ~2.5 eV. So the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than \u0394E. Therefore, the answer should be option C, which states \u27e8H\u27e9 is much less than \u0394E.",

So the transition energy \u0394E here is approximately 2.55 eV.\n\nNow, the paramagnetic coupling term (Zeeman splitting) would be the energy shift due to the magnetic field. Let's compute that.
