Since h = 2\u03c0\u0127, substituting gives E_n = (n\u00b2 (2\u03c0\u0127)^2 )/(8mL\u00b2) ) = (n\u00b2 4\u03c0\u00b2 \u0127\u00b2)/(8mL\u00b2) = (n\u00b2 \u03c0\u00b2 \u0127\u00b2)/(2mL\u00b2). Oh, so actually the energy is E_n = n\u00b2 * E, where E is the given value here. Because the question defines E as \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2).

So each particle's energy is n squared times E.\n\nNow, since the particles are spin-1/2, they are fermions. So they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning that no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. Since it's a 1D box, the quantum numbers are just the principal quantum number n.

So for four particles, the first two (spin up and down) go into n=1, and the next two into n=2. So total energy is (n\u2081\u00b2 + n\u2081\u00b2) + (n\u2082\u00b2 +n\u2082\u00b2) each multiplied by E. Since n=1: 1\u00b2*2 = 2E, n=2: 2\u00b2*2 = 8E. Total is 10E. That would be the ground state. So the ground state energy is 10E. Looking at the options, option C has 4E, 10E, 15E. Option A has 30E which seems way higher. Option D starts at 10E. Hmm, so ground state is 10E.

The second energy level (n=2) similarly has two states, so two more particles. So for four particles, all four can be in the first two energy levels (n=1 and n=2 each filled with two particles).
