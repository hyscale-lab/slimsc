          "text1": "Wait, but then their magnitudes are equal. \n\nThe total energy after decay is the sum of the muon's total energy and the neutrino's energy. The muon's total energy is sqrt( (p_mu)^2 + m_mu^2 ), and the neutrino's energy is p_nu (since m=0, so E_nu = sqrt( p_nu^2 ) = p_nu. But since their momenta are equal in magnitude, let's say p_mu = p and p_nu = p (but opposite direction, so vectorially they cancel). \n\nSo the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2) + p. This must equal the initial energy of the pion, which is m_pi. \n\nSo setting up the equation: sqrt(p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6. \n\nNow I need to solve for p. Let me write that equation again:\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6\n\nHmm, solving for p.

Let me see, 139.6 squared minus 105.7 squared. That's a difference of squares, so (139.6 - 105.7)(139.6 + 105.7). Let me compute those terms:\n\n139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9\n\n139.6 + 105.7 = 245.3\n\nMultiply them: 33.9 * 245.3. Let me calculate that:\n\n33 * 245 = 33*(200 + 45) = 6600 + 1485 = 8085\n\nThen 0.9*245.3 = 220.77, so total 8085 + 220.77 = 8305.77?",

Let me denote sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2) as the muon's energy. Let me write the equation again:\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6\n\nLet me denote m_mu = 105.7, m_pi = 139.6.\n\nLet me call the equation:\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2) + p = m_pi\n\nI need to solve this for p.

Let me compute that again with exact values.\n\nLet me compute numerator: 139.6 squared minus 105.7 squared. As before, that's (139.6 -105.7)*(139.6+105.7). Let's compute those numbers:\n\n139.6 -105.7 = 33.9\n\n139.6 +105.7 = 245.3 \n\nSo numerator is 33.9 *245.3.

So sqrt(12100 -40.66) \u2248 110 -40.66/(2*110) = 110 - 0.185 \u2248109.815. So about 109.8 MeV for E_mu. \n\nThe neutrino's energy is p. Since p is 29.78 MeV (in natural units). So total energy is 109.8 + 29.78 \u2248139.58 MeV, which is close to the pion's mass (139.6), so that checks out. \n\nNow, the kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest energy. So K_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.8 -105.7 = 4.1 MeV. Hmm, that's close to option D's first value (4.12). \n\nThe neutrino's kinetic energy is equal to its total energy since its rest mass is negligible. So K_nu = E_nu = p =29.78 MeV. But then adding the kinetic energies: 4.1 +29.78 =33.88, but the total energy is the pion's rest mass (139.6).",

Let me rearrange the equation.\n\nLet me denote sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2) = m_pi - p \n\nNow, square both sides:\n\np\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 = (m_pi - p)^2 \n\nExpand the right side:\n\n(m_pi)^2 - 2 m_pi p + p\u00b2 \n\nSo, substituting back:\n\np\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 = m_pi\u00b2 - 2 m_pi p + p\u00b2 \n\nCancel the p\u00b2 terms from both sides:\n\nm_mu\u00b2 = m_pi\u00b2 - 2 m_pi p \n\nThen, rearranged:\n\n2 m_pi p = m_pi\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2 \n\nTherefore, solving for p:\n\np = (m_pi\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2) / (2 m_pi )\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nm_pi = 139.6 MeV\n\nm_mu = 105.7 MeV\n\nCompute m_pi squared: 139.6^2. Let me compute that:\n\n139.6 squared. Let's see, 140 squared is 19600, so 139.6 is 0.4 less. (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140\u00b2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4\u00b2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19600 - 112 is 19488, plus 0.16 gives 19488.16. So approximately 19488.16 (MeV)^2.\n\nSimilarly, m_mu squared is 105.7\u00b2. Let's calculate that: 100\u00b2 is 10000, 5.7\u00b2 is 32.49, and cross term 2*100*5.7=1140. So total is 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49 (MeV)^2.\n\nSo m_pi\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 \u2248 19488.16 - 11172.49 = let's subtract:\n\n19488.16\n\n-11172.49\n\n------------\n\n(19488 - 11172) = 8316, and then 0.16 - (-0.49?)",

So all terms in the equation above are in MeV. \n\nLet me denote variables without the c's to simplify. Let me define variables in terms of natural units where c =1.

So sqrt(12100 -40.66) \u2248 110 -40.66/(2*110) = 110 - 0.185 \u2248109.815. So about 109.8 MeV for E_mu. \n\nThe neutrino's energy is p. Since p is 29.78 MeV (in natural units). So total energy is 109.8 + 29.78 \u2248139.58 MeV, which is close to the pion's mass (139.6), so that checks out. \n\nNow, the kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest energy. So K_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.8 -105.7 = 4.1 MeV. Hmm, that's close to option D's first value (4.12). \n\nThe neutrino's kinetic energy is equal to its total energy since its rest mass is negligible. So K_nu = E_nu = p =29.78 MeV. But then adding the kinetic energies: 4.1 +29.78 =33.88, but the total energy is the pion's rest mass (139.6).",

So the energy of the muon is sqrt( p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 ), and the neutrino's energy is p. The sum of these must equal the pion's rest energy, m_pi.\n\nSo the equation is sqrt(p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6.\n\nWe need to solve for p. Once we have p, then the kinetic energy of the muon is (sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2) ) - m_mu, because kinetic energy is total energy minus rest mass energy.

(140 -0.4)^2 = 140\u00b2 - 2*140*0.4 +0.4\u00b2 = 19600 - 112 +0.16 = 19488.16\n\nBut 139.6^2 = (140 -0.4)^2 = 140\u00b2 - 2*140*0.4 +0.4\u00b2 = 19600 -112 +0.16 = 19488.16.\n\nSimilarly 105.7 squared: 105^2 is 11025. 105.7^2 = (105 +0.7)^2 = 105\u00b2 + 2*105*0.7 +0.7\u00b2 = 11025 + 147 +0.49 = 11172.49.\n\nSo the numerator is 19488.16 -11172.49 = 8315.67.\n\nDivide by (2 *139.6) which is 279.2.\n\nSo p = 8315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\nLet me divide 8315.67 by 279.2.\n\n279.2 \u00d7 30 = 8376, which is slightly more than 8315.67.\n\nSo 29.7 times 279.2:\n\n29 *279.2 = 8096.8\n\n0.7 *279.2 = 195.44 \u2192 total 8096.8 +195.44 = 8292.24\n\nSo 29.7 gives 8292.24, which is 8315.67 -8292.24 =23.43 less than numerator.\n\nSo 23.43 /279.2 \u2248 0.0839. So total p \u224829.7 +0.0839 \u224829.784 MeV/c. Let's say approximately 29.78 MeV/c.\n\nSo p \u224829.78 MeV/c.\n\nNow, the kinetic energy of the muon is (total energy - rest mass energy).\n\nTotal energy of muon: sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n29.78 squared: approx 29.78^2 = (30 -0.22)^2 =900 -2*30*0.22 +0.0484 =900 -13.2 +0.0484 \u2248886.8484.\n\n105.7 squared is 11172.49 as before.\n\nAdding them: 886.8484 +11172.49 \u224812059.34. Take square root.\n\nsqrt(12059.34). Let me see. 110 squared is 12100, so sqrt(12059.34) is a bit less than 110. Let's see, 109.8 squared is (110 -0.2)^2 = 12100 -44 +0.04 = 12056.04. Hmm, that's very close. 109.8^2 =12056.04. The value inside sqrt is 12059.34. The difference is 12059.34-12056.04=3.3.

Its rest mass energy is 105.7, so KE_mu = 109.815 -105.7 \u22484.115 MeV.\n\nThe neutrino's energy is p*c, which in natural units is p.",

Since the problem gives only the rest masses of the pion and muon, and not the neutrino, it's safe to assume that the neutrino's mass is negligible here. So the calculations are okay.",
