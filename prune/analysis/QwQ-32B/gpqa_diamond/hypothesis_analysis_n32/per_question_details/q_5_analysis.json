Let me see the given components:\n\nP_x is (\u0127/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]\nP_y is (\u0127/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]]\nP_z is (\u0127/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nThese are exactly the standard Pauli matrices multiplied by \u0127/2. So the operator for a general direction n (nx, ny, nz) would be P\u00b7n = (\u0127/2)(nx \u03c3x + ny \u03c3y + nz \u03c3z). Since n is in the x-z plane, ny=0. Therefore, the operator simplifies to (\u0127/2)(nx \u03c3x + nz \u03c3z).\n\nSo the operator we're dealing with is (\u0127/2)(nx \u03c3x + nz \u03c3z). We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +\u0127/2. \n\nLet me denote the direction vector n as a unit vector. Let\u2019s parameterize n in the x-z plane. Let\u2019s say the angle \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis to the direction n. Then, the components would be nx = sin\u03b8, nz = cos\u03b8. Because if \u03b8 is 0, it's along z, so nx=0 and nz=1. If \u03b8 is 90 degrees, it's along x. \n\nTherefore, the operator becomes (\u0127/2)(sin\u03b8 \u03c3x + cos\u03b8 \u03c3z). Let me write this matrix out. \n\n\u03c3x is [[0,1],[1,0]], and \u03c3z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. \n\nSo the operator matrix is:\n\n(\u0127/2) [ sin\u03b8 * [0 1; 1 0] + cos\u03b8 * [1 0; 0 -1] ]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nsin\u03b8 * \u03c3x gives:\n[0, sin\u03b8]\n[sin\u03b8, 0]\n\ncos\u03b8 * \u03c3z gives:\n[cos\u03b8, 0]\n[0, -cos\u03b8]\n\nAdding them together:\n\nTop left element: 0 + cos\u03b8 = cos\u03b8\nTop right: sin\u03b8 + 0 = sin\u03b8\nBottom left: sin\u03b8 + 0 = sin\u03b8\nBottom right: 0 + (-cos\u03b8) = -cos\u03b8\n\nSo the operator matrix (let's call it M) is:\n\nM = (\u0127/2) * [ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ]\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +\u0127/2. \n\nLet me denote the eigenvalue equation as M * v = (\u0127/2) v. Let me write this equation out. Let v be a column vector [a; b]. Then:\n\n(\u0127/2) [cos\u03b8 a + sin\u03b8 b] = (\u0127/2) a\n(\u0127/2) [sin\u03b8 a - cos\u03b8 b] = (\u0127/2) b\n\nWe can divide both sides by \u0127/2 to simplify:\n\ncos\u03b8 * a + sin\u03b8 * b = a --> (cos\u03b8 - 1)a + sin\u03b8 b = 0\n\nsin\u03b8 * a - cos\u03b8 * b = b --> sin\u03b8 a - (cos\u03b8 +1) b = 0\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1. (cos\u03b8 -1)a + sin\u03b8 b = 0\n2. sin\u03b8 a - (cos\u03b8 +1) b = 0\n\nThese two equations must be satisfied by a and b. Let's see if they are consistent. Let me write them as a system:\n\nEquation 1: (cos\u03b8 -1)a + sin\u03b8 b = 0\n\nEquation 2: sin\u03b8 a - (cos\u03b8 +1) b = 0\n\nLet me try solving for one variable in terms of the other. Let's take equation 1 first:\n\nFrom equation 1: (cos\u03b8 -1)a = - sin\u03b8 b \u2192 a = [ - sin\u03b8 / (cos\u03b8 -1) ] b",

So maybe n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8. Because in spherical coordinates, if \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis, then x component is sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, but since we're in the x-z plane, \u03c6 is 0, so n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8. That seems right. \n\nSo substituting n_x = sin\u03b8 and n_z = cos\u03b8 into the equations. Then:\n\nEquation 1: (cos\u03b8 -1) a + sin\u03b8 b =0 \u2192 sin\u03b8 b = (1 - cos\u03b8)a \u2192 b = [(1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8] a.\n\nHmm, let's simplify (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8. Using trigonometric identities: 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2). So (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = (2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2))/(2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)) ) = tan(\u03b8/2). So then b = tan(\u03b8/2) a.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector is proportional to (a, tan(\u03b8/2) a) \u2192 (1, tan(\u03b8/2)). To normalize it, the norm squared is 1\u00b2 + tan\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = 1 + tan\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = sec\u00b2(\u03b8/2). So the norm is sec(\u03b8/2), so the normalized vector is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)).",

Adding those two gives:\n\nnx \u03c3_x + nz \u03c3_z = [[0 + nz, nx], [nx, 0 - nz]].\n\nThen subtract the identity matrix (scaled by 1, since the equation has -I), so:\n\nnx \u03c3_x + nz \u03c3_z - I = [[ (nz -1), nx ], [nx, -nz -1 ] ]\n\nTherefore, the matrix equation for the eigenvector v = [a; b] is:\n\n[ (nz -1) * a + nx * b = 0 ]\n\n[ nx * a + (-nz -1)*b = 0 ]\n\nWe can write this as two equations.

But the eigenvector would need to be (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) = (sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2), but that's the same as for +x. That can't be right. \n\nAh! Here's the problem. If theta is the polar angle from the z-axis, then the direction along -x is still theta=pi/2 (since it's 90 degrees from z), but the azimuthal angle phi is pi. \n\nTherefore, the eigenvector should be (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)), which with phi=pi, gives (cos(pi/4), - sin(pi/4)) which is correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct general form must include the phase factor e^{i phi}. \n\nBut the question says the direction is in the x-z plane. So phi can be 0 or pi. The problem asks for the eigenvector for an arbitrary direction in x-z plane. The answer must include the phase, because the direction could be in either half of the plane (phi=0 or phi=pi). \n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)). No, the components would be cos(theta) which doesn't fit the standard formula. \n\nOption C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which lacks the phase.",
