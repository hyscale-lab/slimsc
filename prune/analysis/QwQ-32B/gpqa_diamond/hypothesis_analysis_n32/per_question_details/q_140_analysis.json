Let's see, perhaps the precipitate G when heated releases B, which has a melting point near 277K. Let's think of the decomposition product. For example, if G is Mg(OH)2, heating gives MgO and H2O. H2O has a melting point at 273K, close to 277K? The problem says \"very close\", so maybe that's it. So B would be H2O. But H2O is a liquid at room temperature, but when solid, its melting point is exactly 273.15 K. 277 is 4 degrees higher, so maybe rounded? Or perhaps the question is considering normal conditions, so under standard pressure, but maybe the B is actually water (H2O), which would have that melting point. So then the precipitate G is Mg(OH)2, which when heated releases H2O and MgO. Then B is H2O? But in that case, the product of the reaction between the keto acid and X: the question says that product contains two oxygen atoms. Let me think.",

Let's say when X is a metal hydride, reacting with liquid Y (water) produces the metal hydroxide and D2. If the hydroxide is, say, Mg(OH)2, which is insoluble, then it would precipitate. So if X is magnesium hydride (MgH2), reacting with water: MgH2 + 2 H2O \u2192 Mg(OH)2 \u2193 + 2 H2\u2191. But in this case, the gas would be H2, but if X uses D, then D2. So W is D2. The precipitate G is Mg(OH)2. When heated, Mg(OH)2 decomposes into MgO and H2O. So the B would be H2O, which has a melting point of 273 K (so close to 277 K as given). That fits! So B is H2O (water), which melts at 273 K, very close to 277 K. \n\nSo in this scenario, X is MgD2 (magnesium deuteride), which has a heavier isotope (deuterium instead of regular H). The reaction is MgD2 + 2 H2O \u2192 Mg(OH)2\u2193 + D2\u2191. The precipitate Mg(OH)2 when heated gives MgO and H2O (as B). \n\nNow, checking the other part: the reaction of a certain keto acid with X (MgD2).",

So if B is H2O, then when the precipitate G is heated, it releases water. How would G release water? Maybe G is a hydrate. \n\nSuppose the reaction produces a hydrate like MgSO4\u00b77H2O. When heated, it loses water, so B would be H2O, but then the melting point is 273. Close to 277. Maybe that's acceptable. \n\nSo, if the precipitate is a hydrate, then what reaction would form that? Let's think again. \n\nSuppose X is a metal hydride. Let's say it's MgH2. When reacting with water (H2O), MgH2 + 2 H2O \u2192 Mg(OH)2 + 2 H2\u2191. Mg(OH)2 is a precipitate (insoluble). The precipitate is Mg(OH)2. When heated, it decomposes into MgO and H2O. MgO's melting point is very high, but the released B would be H2O. If B is H2O, then its melting point is 273 K, which is close to 277. So maybe that's it. \n\nIn this scenario, X is MgH2. Let's check the other clues. \n\nThe product of the reaction of a keto acid with X (MgH2).",
