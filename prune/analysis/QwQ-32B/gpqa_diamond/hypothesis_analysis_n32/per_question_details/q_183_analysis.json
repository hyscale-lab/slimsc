The name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- Cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid: The cyclohexene (6 carbons) with a carboxylic acid group. So the base structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (between 3 and 4?), and the carboxylic acid is attached to one carbon (position 1, probably).\n\n- 2-formyl: So at position 2 on the ring, there is a CHO group.\n\n-5-vinyl: at position 5 on the ring, there is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-)\n\nSo the carbons:\n\nThe ring has 6 carbons. The vinyl group adds two carbons (the CH2 and the CH).\n\nThe formyl and carboxylic acid are substituents on the ring, not adding carbons.\n\nTotal carbons: 6 (ring) + 2 (vinyl) = 8.\n\nHydrogens: Let's count.\n\nThe cyclohexene ring (with double bond at 3-4):\n\nEach carbon in a cyclohexane has two H's on the ring. But with a double bond, the carbons involved in the double bond have fewer H's. Let's see:\n\nIn a cyclohexene ring (with a double bond between C3 and C4), each of those carbons has one H attached (since they are double-bonded to each other). The other carbons (C1, C2, C5, C6) would have two H's each (assuming no substitution). But the substituents here are:\n\n- C1 has the carboxylic acid: -COOH. So that carbon's structure is R-COOH, so instead of two H's, it has the carboxylic acid group. The carboxylic acid has a COOH, so the carbon is connected to O, so H count on C1 is reduced.\n\n- C2 has the formyl group (CHO), so that carbon has a CHO substituent instead of two H's.\n\n- C5 has the vinyl group (CH2=CH-), so the carbon is connected to the vinyl group (so instead of two H's on C5, it has the vinyl).\n\nThis is getting complex. Maybe instead of exact H count, let's just track the IHD changes.\n\nThe product after reaction:\n\n- The carboxylic acid group is gone, replaced by iodine on C1. So C1 now has an iodine instead of the COOH group. The iodine doesn't contribute to IHD.\n\n- The formyl group's C=O is gone, perhaps replaced by CH2I or CH2OH (depending on reaction). \n\n- The cyclohexene double bond is broken into a single bond with H and I added. So C3 and C4 now have a single bond with H and I attached.\n\n- The vinyl group's double bond is also broken into a single bond with H and I added.\n\n- The ring remains as a cyclohexane (since the cyclohexene's double bond is broken).\n\nSo in the product:\n\n- The ring is still a six-membered ring (so 1 IHD from the ring).\n\n- All other double bonds are gone (carboxylic acid's C=O, formyl's C=O, cyclohexene's double bond, and vinyl's double bond are all gone). \n\n- Are there any new double bonds? Probably not, since all double bonds were broken by HI addition or removal.\n\nTherefore, the total IHD is 1 (from the ring) plus any double bonds. Since there are none, the IHD is 1.",

The formyl group (CHO) adds no new carbons (it's on a ring carbon). The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) adds two carbons (since it's a substituent), so total carbons: 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nHydrogens: Let's see. The cyclohexene ring (without substituents) has 10 H (since cyclohexane has 12 H, minus 2 for the double bond: wait, actually, cyclohexene (6 carbons with one double bond) has 10 H? Let me think: each CH2 group in a cyclohexane has 2 H, but with a double bond, the two carbons in the double bond have fewer H.
