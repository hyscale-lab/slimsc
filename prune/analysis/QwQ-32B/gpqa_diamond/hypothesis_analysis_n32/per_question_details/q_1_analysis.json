Let's compute \u0394E using \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u0394t.\n\n\u0127 is Planck's constant over 2\u03c0. Let me confirm the value of \u0127 in eV\u00b7s. \n\nI remember that \u0127 \u2248 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. To convert that to eV\u00b7s, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 1.054e-34 J\u00b7s divided by 1.602e-19 J/eV = (1.054 / 1.602) * 1e-15 eV\u00b7s \u2248 0.658 * 1e-15 = 6.58e-16 eV\u00b7s. \n\nSo yes, that's correct. So for the first state:\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127/(\u0394t1) = 6.58e-16 eV\u00b7s / 1e-9 s = 6.58e-7 eV. \n\nSecond state:\n\n6.58e-16 /1e-8 = 6.58e-8 eV. \n\nSo the first's uncertainty is 6.58e-7, which is 6.58 \u00d7 10^-7 eV. The energy difference must be larger than this. So the minimum required is ~1e-6 eV (since 6.58e-7 is ~0.658e-6, so maybe 1e-6 is the next order). \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 1e-4, which is way larger. So that's okay. But the problem is, perhaps the question is expecting that the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty given by the shorter lifetime?

Converting to eV: divide by 1.6e-19 J/eV.\n\nSo 1.05e-25 / 1.6e-19 = (1.05/1.6) * 1e-6 \u2248 0.656e-6 eV = 6.56e-7 eV. That's the same as before.\n\nFor the second state (1e-8 s):\n\n\u0394E2 = (1.05e-34)/(1e-8) = 1.05e-26 J \u2192 divided by 1.6e-19 \u2192 1.05e-26/(1.6e-19) = ~6.56e-8 eV.\n\nSo the uncertainties are 6.56e-7 and 6.56e-8.

Since when you have two states with their own uncertainties, the energy difference must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. But in that case, the sum would be 6.56e-7 + 6.56e-8 \u2248 7.2e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be larger than that, so the minimum acceptable is 1e-4 eV (since 1e-4 is way bigger, and the other options are smaller). \n\nHmm, so then the answer would be C. But let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 1e-9 is way smaller than 6.5e-7, so not.\n\nB) 1e-11 \u2192 even smaller.\n\nC) 1e-4 \u2192 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4. That's 100 times larger than 6.5e-7 (since 6.5e-7 is ~0.00000065). \n\nD) 1e-8 \u2192 which is 0.00000001 eV. That's 1e-8, so 0.01e-6 vs 0.65e-6. So 1e-8 is smaller than the first uncertainty. \n\nSo the only option that's larger than the required uncertainty is option C, 1e-4 eV.",

The energy uncertainty of each state is their own \u0394E. So the total uncertainty in the energy difference between the two states would be sqrt( (\u0394E1)^2 + (\u0394E2)^2 ).
