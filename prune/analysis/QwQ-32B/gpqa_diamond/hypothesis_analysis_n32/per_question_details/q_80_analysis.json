Let's see:\n\nThen the assignments would be:\n\nA=25, T=30, C=1, G=45.\n\nLet's check the second equation:\n\n2*30 (T) =60, plus 2*45 (G)=90, plus C (1), plus A (25). Total 60+90=150 +1=151 +25=176. Yes! That works.\n\nNow, let's see if this holds with the second example. So the values are A=25, T=30, C=1, G=45.\n\nLet me test the first example again:\n\nAGG: A=25, G=45 each. So 25 +45 +45 =115 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nSecond example: TGCTGA \u2192 T(30), G(45), C(1), T(30), G(45), A(25).\n\nSum all:30+45+1+30+45+25.\n\nAdding step by step:\n\n30+45=75; +1 \u219276; +30 \u2192106; +45 \u2192151; +25 \u2192176 \u2714\ufe0f. Perfect!\n\nOkay, so the algorithm is assigning each nucleotide a value as follows:\n\nA:25\n\nT:30\n\nC:1\n\nG:45\n\nThen the output is the sum of the values of each nucleotide in the sequence.\n\nNow, we need to calculate ACAGTGACC's value. Let's break it down letter by letter.\n\nThe sequence is A C A G T G A C C.",

Like in AGG: 1A, 2G, so 1\u00d7 something + 2\u00d7 another. Let's see:\n\nLet\u2019s denote A's value as a, G as g. So 1a + 2g = 115.\n\nSecond example: TGCTGA has 2 T's, 2 G's, 1 C, 1 A. So 2t + 2g + 1c +1a =176.\n\nBut without more equations, this is hard. Maybe assume that the values for A, T, C, G are integers and find a pattern.\n\nSuppose that A=5, then G would be (115-5)/2=55. Then in second equation, let's see:\n\nLet\u2019s say variables are a, t, c, g.\n\nEquation1: a +2g=115 \u2192 a=115-2g.\n\nEquation2: a +2t +2g +c =176 \u2192 substituting a: (115-2g) +2t +2g +c =176 \u2192115 + 2t +c =176 \u21922t +c=61.\n\nNow, we need to assign values to t and c such that 2t +c =61. Let's assume that all values are integers and possibly following a pattern. Let's think maybe T is 20, C is 21? Then 2*20 +21=61. Oh! 2t +c =61 \u2192 if T=20 and C=21, then yes. So that would fit.\n\nSo let me check:\n\nIf T is 20, C is21, then 2*20 +21=61. That works.\n\nNow, then, what's A and G? \n\nFrom equation1, a +2g =115. \n\nWe need to find a and g such that they fit into a possible pattern. If T is 20 and C is21, maybe the values are assigned as T=20 (T is the 20th letter?), but T is the 20th letter in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, ..., T=20).",

Divided by 3 letters: 115/3 \u2248 38.33 per base. Maybe each base has a value around there. Let me think:\n\nSuppose each base has a value of 31, 42, etc. Let me try:\n\nSuppose A=31, G=42. Then AGG would be 31 +42 +42 = 115. That works. \n\nThen check the second example. Let's see:\n\nTGCTGA has T, G, C, T, G, A. So T's value, G (42), C's value, T again, G (42), and A (31). Let's denote T as y and C as z. \n\nThe equation would be y +42 + z + y +42 +31 = 176.\n\nCombine like terms: 2y + z + (42+42) + (31) \u2192 2y + z + 84 +31 = 2y + z + 115 = 176. \n\nSubtract 115: 2y + z = 61.\n\nHmm, so if I can find values for T and C that satisfy this, and perhaps they are integers. Let's suppose T is 20, then z would be 61 - 40 =21. But not sure. Let me see if there's a pattern with the numbers.",

Correct. \n\nNow, let's compute the third example:\n\nACAGTGACC: letters are A (25), C (11), A (25), G (45), T (25), G (45), A (25), C (11), C (11). \n\nAdding these:\n\n25+11=36; +25=61; +45=106; +25=131; +45=176; +25=201; +11=212; +11=223. \n\nStill not matching the options. \n\nHmm. Let me try another approach. Let me think of the options. The third example has 9 letters, so perhaps each letter contributes roughly (315/9)=35, (185/9\u224820.5), (333/9=37), (351/9=39). \n\nThe first example's average per letter is 115/3\u224838.3. The second is 176/6\u224829.3. \n\nThe first option (315) would average 35. \n\nHmm, but why would the average drop from 38 to 35?",
