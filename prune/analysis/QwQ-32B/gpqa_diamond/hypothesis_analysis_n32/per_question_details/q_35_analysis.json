The wording says \"the eigenfunctions \u03c6 of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.\" The basis functions of the matrix operator would refer to the basis in which the matrix is expressed, not the eigenbasis. Since the matrix is given in terms of S's entries, which are the Pauli matrix, which is typically in the z-basis. For example, the Pauli matrices are usually written in the eigenbasis of Sz. So the matrix given here (S) is in the z-basis. Therefore, the eigenfunctions of Ay (which are the eigenvectors of \u03c3_y) would form a different basis. So the basis functions of the matrix (which is given in z-basis) are the standard basis vectors, not the eigenfunctions of Ay. Thus D's statement is incorrect because the basis functions of the matrix operator (as presented in the problem) are not the eigenfunctions of Ay. Therefore D is incorrect. \n\nSo that leaves C as the correct option. Let me check the other options again. \n\nOption C is correct.

So A squared is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix. Therefore, every vector is an eigenfunction of A squared, with eigenvalue c\u00b2*(1). Therefore, any eigenfunction of Ay is automatically an eigenfunction of A squared, because A squared is proportional to identity. So C's first part is correct.

          "text1": "Wait, looking at the problem again: the options are statements to consider correct during the calculation. Let's think step by step what would be correct during the calculation.\n\nThe first step when calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors is to set up (Ay - a I)\u03c6 =0, where a is eigenvalue. Since Ay is a Hermitian operator (because angular momentum operators are Hermitian), its eigenvalues must be real. So any option that suggests imaginary parts to eigenvalues (A and B) can be immediately discarded, so A and B are wrong. So that leaves C and D.\n\nNow, between C and D. \n\nOption C says the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A\u00b2, which is true because A\u00b2 commutes with Ay (since [A\u00b2, Ay] =0 because A\u00b2 is the sum of squares of the components, and each component commutes with A\u00b2). Therefore, they share eigenfunctions. So C is correct.\n\nThe second part of C says \"but not of the Z-component, Az.\" That is also correct because Ay and Az do not commute, so they can't have simultaneous eigenstates unless in some special case. Therefore, an eigenstate of Ay is not an eigenstate of Az. So C's statement is correct.\n\nOption D: The eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. \n\nHmm, the matrix Ay is given in a certain basis (the standard basis, since the matrix entries are given as rows and columns). The eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors of this matrix. So in that basis, the eigenfunctions are vectors expressed in that basis. However, the basis functions of the operator could be interpreted as the basis in which the operator is diagonal, which would be its eigenvectors. But the given matrix isn't in that basis. Therefore, the matrix is presented in a different basis. So the statement might be incorrect. The \"basis functions of the matrix operator\" would refer to the basis in which the operator is represented. Since the operator is given in a specific basis (the standard basis), the eigenfunctions are not necessarily the basis functions unless they are aligned with that basis. Since the matrix isn't diagonal, they aren't. So D's statement might be incorrect.",
          "text2": "Wait, the options are multiple-choice, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me see:\n\nOption C and D both might look correct. I need to check which is correct. Let me think again.\n\nThe eigenvalues of Ay are \u00b1h/(4\u03c0). So the real parts are \u00b1h/(4\u03c0), but the eigenvalues are real, so the imaginary parts are zero. So options A and B can be eliminated because they mention imaginary parts. So only C and D are possible.\n\nLooking at option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A\u00b2. Since A\u00b2 is the square of the total angular momentum operator, which commutes with any component. Since Ay and A\u00b2 commute, their eigenfunctions can be chosen to be the same. Therefore, any eigenfunction of Ay is an eigenfunction of A\u00b2. So the first part of C is correct. The second part says \"but not of the Z-component, Az.\" Since Az and Ay do not commute, their eigenfunctions are not the same (unless in some degenerate case, but here the eigenvalues are non-degenerate because the eigenvalues of Ay are distinct). Therefore, the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So C is correct.\n\nOption D: The eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator given. The basis functions here would be the standard basis vectors (like [1;0], [0;1]). The eigenfunctions of Ay are different. For example, the eigenvectors of \u03c3_y (the matrix S) can be found. Let me compute them quickly.\n\nThe matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. To find eigenvectors for eigenvalue 1:\n\n(S - 1I)v = 0 \u2192 \n\nRows are [-1, -i] and [i, -1]. Let's set up equations:\n\n-1*v1 -i v2 = 0\n\ni*v1 -1*v2 = 0\n\nLet me pick v1 = 1, then from first equation: -1 -i v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 = -1/i = i. So the eigenvector is [1; i], normalized. Similarly for eigenvalue -1, the eigenvector would be [1; -i]. \n\nSo the eigenvectors are [1; i] and [1; -i], which are not the standard basis vectors. Therefore, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) of Ay are not the same as the basis vectors of the matrix (which are standard). But they form their own basis. So D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Hmm, maybe the \"basis functions of the matrix operator\" refers to the basis in which the operator is diagonal. In that case, the eigenbasis of Ay would be the basis functions here. But the question says the matrix is given as Ay = c*S, so the matrix is already in some basis.

Since Ay and Az don't commute (they are components of angular momentum, so their commutator is non-zero), so an eigenfunction of Ay is not necessarily an eigenfunction of Az.

Let's think step by step what would be correct during the calculation.\n\nThe first step when calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors is to set up (Ay - a I)\u03c6 =0, where a is eigenvalue. Since Ay is a Hermitian operator (because angular momentum operators are Hermitian), its eigenvalues must be real. So any option that suggests imaginary parts to eigenvalues (A and B) can be immediately discarded, so A and B are wrong. So that leaves C and D.\n\nNow, between C and D. \n\nOption C says the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A\u00b2, which is true because A\u00b2 commutes with Ay (since [A\u00b2, Ay] =0 because A\u00b2 is the sum of squares of the components, and each component commutes with A\u00b2). Therefore, they share eigenfunctions. So C is correct.\n\nThe second part of C says \"but not of the Z-component, Az.\" That is also correct because Ay and Az do not commute, so they can't have simultaneous eigenstates unless in some special case. Therefore, an eigenstate of Ay is not an eigenstate of Az. So C's statement is correct.\n\nOption D: The eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. \n\nHmm, the matrix Ay is given in a certain basis (the standard basis, since the matrix entries are given as rows and columns). The eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors of this matrix. So in that basis, the eigenfunctions are vectors expressed in that basis. However, the basis functions of the operator could be interpreted as the basis in which the operator is diagonal, which would be its eigenvectors. But the given matrix isn't in that basis. Therefore, the matrix is presented in a different basis. So the statement might be incorrect. The \"basis functions of the matrix operator\" would refer to the basis in which the operator is represented. Since the operator is given in a specific basis (the standard basis), the eigenfunctions are not necessarily the basis functions unless they are aligned with that basis. Since the matrix isn't diagonal, they aren't. So D's statement might be incorrect.",
          "text2": "Wait, the options are multiple-choice, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me see:\n\nOption C and D both might look correct. I need to check which is correct. Let me think again.\n\nThe eigenvalues of Ay are \u00b1h/(4\u03c0). So the real parts are \u00b1h/(4\u03c0), but the eigenvalues are real, so the imaginary parts are zero. So options A and B can be eliminated because they mention imaginary parts. So only C and D are possible.\n\nLooking at option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A\u00b2. Since A\u00b2 is the square of the total angular momentum operator, which commutes with any component. Since Ay and A\u00b2 commute, their eigenfunctions can be chosen to be the same. Therefore, any eigenfunction of Ay is an eigenfunction of A\u00b2. So the first part of C is correct. The second part says \"but not of the Z-component, Az.\" Since Az and Ay do not commute, their eigenfunctions are not the same (unless in some degenerate case, but here the eigenvalues are non-degenerate because the eigenvalues of Ay are distinct). Therefore, the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So C is correct.\n\nOption D: The eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator given. The basis functions here would be the standard basis vectors (like [1;0], [0;1]). The eigenfunctions of Ay are different. For example, the eigenvectors of \u03c3_y (the matrix S) can be found. Let me compute them quickly.\n\nThe matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. To find eigenvectors for eigenvalue 1:\n\n(S - 1I)v = 0 \u2192 \n\nRows are [-1, -i] and [i, -1]. Let's set up equations:\n\n-1*v1 -i v2 = 0\n\ni*v1 -1*v2 = 0\n\nLet me pick v1 = 1, then from first equation: -1 -i v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 = -1/i = i. So the eigenvector is [1; i], normalized. Similarly for eigenvalue -1, the eigenvector would be [1; -i]. \n\nSo the eigenvectors are [1; i] and [1; -i], which are not the standard basis vectors. Therefore, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) of Ay are not the same as the basis vectors of the matrix (which are standard). But they form their own basis. So D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Hmm, maybe the \"basis functions of the matrix operator\" refers to the basis in which the operator is diagonal.

The commutator [Ly, Lz] is i\u0127 Lx. Since they don't commute, their eigenvectors are not the same unless they are in a common eigenspace. Since the angular momentum operators for different components don't share eigenstates except for the total angular momentum, the eigenvectors of Ay would not be eigenvectors of Az unless they are in a state that's a simultaneous eigenstate of both, which generally isn't the case. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. Therefore, option C's statement is correct. \n\nOption D: The eigenfunctions \u03c6 of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Hmm. The basis functions for a 2x2 matrix are just the standard basis vectors, but the eigenvectors of Ay (which are the same as the eigenvectors of \u03c3_y) are specific vectors. Let me compute the eigenvectors of S (\u03c3_y) to check. \n\nLet's find eigenvectors for S with eigenvalue +1. The equation (S - I)v =0:\n\nMatrix S - I is:\n[ -1    -i ]\n[  i    -1 ]\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n- v1 -i v2 =0 \n\ni v1 - v2 =0 \n\nLet me take the first equation: v1 = -i v2. Let's set v2 = 1, then v1 = -i. So the eigenvector is proportional to (-i, 1). To make it a unit vector, divide by sqrt( (-i)^2 +1^2 ), but wait modulus squared would be | -i |\u00b2 + |1|\u00b2 = 1 +1 =2, so sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is ( -i/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2) ). \n\nSimilarly, for eigenvalue -1, the matrix S + I is:\n\n[ 1   -i ]\n\n[ i   1 ]\n\nEquation: v1 -i v2 =0, and i v1 + v2 =0. From first equation v1 =i v2. Let v2 =1, v1 =i. Then the eigenvector is (i,1), normalized similarly. \n\nSo the eigenvectors are these complex vectors. The basis functions of the operator (the matrix) would be the eigenvectors?",

Since the matrix is given in terms of S's entries, which are the Pauli matrix, which is typically in the z-basis. For example, the Pauli matrices are usually written in the eigenbasis of Sz.

          "text1": "Wait, looking at the problem again: the options are statements to consider correct during the calculation. Let's think step by step what would be correct during the calculation.\n\nThe first step when calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors is to set up (Ay - a I)\u03c6 =0, where a is eigenvalue. Since Ay is a Hermitian operator (because angular momentum operators are Hermitian), its eigenvalues must be real. So any option that suggests imaginary parts to eigenvalues (A and B) can be immediately discarded, so A and B are wrong. So that leaves C and D.\n\nNow, between C and D. \n\nOption C says the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A\u00b2, which is true because A\u00b2 commutes with Ay (since [A\u00b2, Ay] =0 because A\u00b2 is the sum of squares of the components, and each component commutes with A\u00b2). Therefore, they share eigenfunctions. So C is correct.\n\nThe second part of C says \"but not of the Z-component, Az.\" That is also correct because Ay and Az do not commute, so they can't have simultaneous eigenstates unless in some special case. Therefore, an eigenstate of Ay is not an eigenstate of Az. So C's statement is correct.\n\nOption D: The eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. \n\nHmm, the matrix Ay is given in a certain basis (the standard basis, since the matrix entries are given as rows and columns). The eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors of this matrix. So in that basis, the eigenfunctions are vectors expressed in that basis. However, the basis functions of the operator could be interpreted as the basis in which the operator is diagonal, which would be its eigenvectors. But the given matrix isn't in that basis. Therefore, the matrix is presented in a different basis. So the statement might be incorrect. The \"basis functions of the matrix operator\" would refer to the basis in which the operator is represented. Since the operator is given in a specific basis (the standard basis), the eigenfunctions are not necessarily the basis functions unless they are aligned with that basis. Since the matrix isn't diagonal, they aren't. So D's statement might be incorrect.",
          "text2": "Wait, the options are multiple-choice, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me see:\n\nOption C and D both might look correct. I need to check which is correct. Let me think again.\n\nThe eigenvalues of Ay are \u00b1h/(4\u03c0). So the real parts are \u00b1h/(4\u03c0), but the eigenvalues are real, so the imaginary parts are zero. So options A and B can be eliminated because they mention imaginary parts. So only C and D are possible.\n\nLooking at option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A\u00b2. Since A\u00b2 is the square of the total angular momentum operator, which commutes with any component. Since Ay and A\u00b2 commute, their eigenfunctions can be chosen to be the same. Therefore, any eigenfunction of Ay is an eigenfunction of A\u00b2. So the first part of C is correct. The second part says \"but not of the Z-component, Az.\" Since Az and Ay do not commute, their eigenfunctions are not the same (unless in some degenerate case, but here the eigenvalues are non-degenerate because the eigenvalues of Ay are distinct). Therefore, the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So C is correct.\n\nOption D: The eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator given. The basis functions here would be the standard basis vectors (like [1;0], [0;1]). The eigenfunctions of Ay are different. For example, the eigenvectors of \u03c3_y (the matrix S) can be found. Let me compute them quickly.\n\nThe matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. To find eigenvectors for eigenvalue 1:\n\n(S - 1I)v = 0 \u2192 \n\nRows are [-1, -i] and [i, -1]. Let's set up equations:\n\n-1*v1 -i v2 = 0\n\ni*v1 -1*v2 = 0\n\nLet me pick v1 = 1, then from first equation: -1 -i v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 = -1/i = i. So the eigenvector is [1; i], normalized. Similarly for eigenvalue -1, the eigenvector would be [1; -i]. \n\nSo the eigenvectors are [1; i] and [1; -i], which are not the standard basis vectors. Therefore, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) of Ay are not the same as the basis vectors of the matrix (which are standard). But they form their own basis. So D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Hmm, maybe the \"basis functions of the matrix operator\" refers to the basis in which the operator is diagonal. In that case, the eigenbasis of Ay would be the basis functions here. But the question says the matrix is given as Ay = c*S, so the matrix is already in some basis.

So Ay = (\u0127/2) * \u03c3_y, which matches the standard form for the spin angular momentum operator. \n\nSo to find the eigenvalues of Ay, we can proceed by first finding the eigenvalues of S (the Pauli Y matrix) and then scaling by c. Let me calculate the eigenvalues of S first. \n\nThe eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(S - \u03bbI) = 0. \n\nFor matrix S:\nTop row: 0 - \u03bb, -i\nBottom row: i, 0 - \u03bb\n\nThe determinant is (0 - \u03bb)(0 - \u03bb) - (-i)(i) = \u03bb\u00b2 - (-i)(i).

That makes sense. So c here is indeed \u0127/2, since c = h/(4\u03c0). Therefore, Ay is (\u0127/2) * \u03c3_y, which is the standard form for the spin angular momentum operator. \n\nNow, the question is about eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The eigenvalue equation is Ay \u03c6 = a \u03c6, where a is the eigenvalue. \n\nFirst, let's find the eigenvalues of S (the Pauli-Y matrix) and then scale them by c. \n\nThe eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are known. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Let me confirm that. The Pauli-Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. To find eigenvalues, compute the determinant of (S - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nSo determinant of [[-\u03bb, -i], [i, -\u03bb]] = (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (-i)(i) = \u03bb\u00b2 - (-i^2). Since i^2 is -1, so (-i)(i) = -i\u00b2 = 1. So determinant is \u03bb\u00b2 - (1) = 0. So \u03bb\u00b2 =1 \u2192 \u03bb = \u00b11. So eigenvalues of S are +1 and -1.

So that part of option C is correct. However, the second part says \"but not of the Z-component, Az\". Since the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az (because Sy and Sz don't commute), that's correct. So option C seems correct so far. \n\nOption D says the eigenfunctions \u03c6 of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, basis functions here would probably refer to the standard basis vectors. But the eigenfunctions of Ay (which is the Sy matrix) are specific vectors. The basis functions (like |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9) are different from the standard basis (like |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9). So if the question's matrix is given in the standard basis, then the eigenfunctions would be vectors in that basis expressed in terms of the standard basis vectors. For example, the eigenstates of Sy (the Pauli-Y matrix) are |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, which can be written as combinations of the standard basis vectors. So the eigenfunctions are not the same as the basis functions of the matrix (which would be the standard basis vectors). Therefore, D might not be correct.",

Therefore, the square operator commutes with all components, so any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A\u00b2. But does it commute with Az? The operators Ay and Az do not commute.

Therefore, eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A\u00b2. So that part of option C is correct. But does the eigenfunction of Ay necessarily not an eigenfunction of Az? Well, unless the state is an eigenstate of both Ay and Az, which generally isn't the case. Since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenstates are different. So the eigenstate of Ay would not be an eigenstate of Az unless it's a simultaneous eigenstate, which isn't possible except for maybe zero, but since the operators don't commute, they can't share eigenstates except possibly in some degenerate case.

Hmm. The basis functions for a 2x2 matrix would typically be the standard basis vectors, like [1;0] and [0;1]. But the eigenfunctions of Ay would be specific vectors. For example, the eigenvectors of the Pauli-Y matrix are probably different from the standard basis. Let me think. Let's compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of S (the Pauli-Y matrix) to check. \n\nThe matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. To find eigenvectors, we can set up (S - \u03bbI)v = 0. The eigenvalues of S are \u00b11. For \u03bb=1: (S - I)v = [[-1, -i], [i, -1]]v = 0. Let's take the first row: -v1 -i v2 =0 \u2192 v1 = -i v2. Let v2 =1, then v1= -i. So the eigenvector is (-i,1). Similarly for \u03bb=-1: (S + I)v = [[1, -i], [i, 1]]v=0. The equation from first row: v1 -i v2 =0 \u2192 v1 =i v2. Let v2=1, then v1 =i. So eigenvector (i,1). So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are these complex vectors. The basis functions of the matrix operator would be the standard basis vectors, but the eigenvectors are different. So D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay, which they are not. So D is incorrect. \n\nSo looking back at the options, C seems correct. Let me check again. The first part: the eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A\u00b2. Since A\u00b2 is the square of the angular momentum operator, which commutes with Ay, so yes, they can share eigenfunctions. The second part: not of Az. Since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenstates can't be simultaneous, so that's correct. So option C is correct.",

          "text1": "Wait, looking at the problem again: the options are statements to consider correct during the calculation. Let's think step by step what would be correct during the calculation.\n\nThe first step when calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors is to set up (Ay - a I)\u03c6 =0, where a is eigenvalue. Since Ay is a Hermitian operator (because angular momentum operators are Hermitian), its eigenvalues must be real. So any option that suggests imaginary parts to eigenvalues (A and B) can be immediately discarded, so A and B are wrong. So that leaves C and D.\n\nNow, between C and D. \n\nOption C says the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A\u00b2, which is true because A\u00b2 commutes with Ay (since [A\u00b2, Ay] =0 because A\u00b2 is the sum of squares of the components, and each component commutes with A\u00b2). Therefore, they share eigenfunctions. So C is correct.\n\nThe second part of C says \"but not of the Z-component, Az.\" That is also correct because Ay and Az do not commute, so they can't have simultaneous eigenstates unless in some special case. Therefore, an eigenstate of Ay is not an eigenstate of Az. So C's statement is correct.\n\nOption D: The eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. \n\nHmm, the matrix Ay is given in a certain basis (the standard basis, since the matrix entries are given as rows and columns). The eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors of this matrix. So in that basis, the eigenfunctions are vectors expressed in that basis. However, the basis functions of the operator could be interpreted as the basis in which the operator is diagonal, which would be its eigenvectors. But the given matrix isn't in that basis. Therefore, the matrix is presented in a different basis. So the statement might be incorrect. The \"basis functions of the matrix operator\" would refer to the basis in which the operator is represented. Since the operator is given in a specific basis (the standard basis), the eigenfunctions are not necessarily the basis functions unless they are aligned with that basis. Since the matrix isn't diagonal, they aren't. So D's statement might be incorrect.",
          "text2": "Wait, the options are multiple-choice, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me see:\n\nOption C and D both might look correct. I need to check which is correct. Let me think again.\n\nThe eigenvalues of Ay are \u00b1h/(4\u03c0). So the real parts are \u00b1h/(4\u03c0), but the eigenvalues are real, so the imaginary parts are zero. So options A and B can be eliminated because they mention imaginary parts. So only C and D are possible.\n\nLooking at option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A\u00b2. Since A\u00b2 is the square of the total angular momentum operator, which commutes with any component. Since Ay and A\u00b2 commute, their eigenfunctions can be chosen to be the same. Therefore, any eigenfunction of Ay is an eigenfunction of A\u00b2. So the first part of C is correct. The second part says \"but not of the Z-component, Az.\" Since Az and Ay do not commute, their eigenfunctions are not the same (unless in some degenerate case, but here the eigenvalues are non-degenerate because the eigenvalues of Ay are distinct). Therefore, the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So C is correct.\n\nOption D: The eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator given. The basis functions here would be the standard basis vectors (like [1;0], [0;1]). The eigenfunctions of Ay are different. For example, the eigenvectors of \u03c3_y (the matrix S) can be found. Let me compute them quickly.\n\nThe matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. To find eigenvectors for eigenvalue 1:\n\n(S - 1I)v = 0 \u2192 \n\nRows are [-1, -i] and [i, -1]. Let's set up equations:\n\n-1*v1 -i v2 = 0\n\ni*v1 -1*v2 = 0\n\nLet me pick v1 = 1, then from first equation: -1 -i v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 = -1/i = i. So the eigenvector is [1; i], normalized. Similarly for eigenvalue -1, the eigenvector would be [1; -i]. \n\nSo the eigenvectors are [1; i] and [1; -i], which are not the standard basis vectors. Therefore, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) of Ay are not the same as the basis vectors of the matrix (which are standard). But they form their own basis. So D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Hmm, maybe the \"basis functions of the matrix operator\" refers to the basis in which the operator is diagonal.
