F_spot is the flux per unit area of the spots. The ratio F_spot/F_normal is (T_spot/T_normal)^4.

The maximum deviation is (F_normal - mean) = (F_normal - (F_normal + F_spot)/2) = (F_normal - F_spot)/2. So the amplitude is (F_normal - F_spot)/2 divided by the mean? Hmm, perhaps the question is referring to the maximum fractional change, so (F_normal - F_spot)/F_normal. That would be the same as the fractional depth when the spots are in view, which is similar to a transit depth.

Let's compute that again. 5/6 is ~0.8333. 0.8333^4 = (0.8333)^2 squared. 0.8333 squared is about 0.6944, then squared again is 0.6944^2 \u2248 0.4823. So the spots emit about 48.23% of the flux of the surrounding photosphere.\n\nThus, the total flux when the spots are facing us is:\n\nTotal flux F_spot_visible = (1 - f)*F0 + f*(F0 * (T_spot / T_eff)^4 )\n\nFactor out F0:\n\nF_spot_visible = F0 [ (1 - f) + f*( (T_spot / T_eff)^4 ) ]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n= F0 [ (0.9) + 0.1*(0.4823) ]\n\n0.1 * 0.4823 is ~0.04823.\n\nSo total is 0.9 + 0.04823 = 0.94823.\n\nTherefore, the flux when spots are visible is 0.94823 F0. \n\nThe amplitude of the variation is (F_max - F_min)/F_max. Since F_max is F0 (when non-spotted side is facing), and F_min is F_spot_visible = 0.94823 F0. So the amplitude is (F0 - 0.94823 F0)/F0 = (1 - 0.94823) = 0.05177, which is ~5.18% as before.\n\nSo the amplitude from the starspots is ~5.18%.\n\nNow, the exoplanet transit amplitude is (R_p/R_s)^2. We need this to equal 0.0518. So solving for R_p/R_s = sqrt(0.0518) \u2248 sqrt(0.0518). Let's calculate that:\n\nsqrt(0.0518) is approximately sqrt(0.05) is ~0.2236, sqrt(0.0518) is a bit higher. Let's compute 0.228 squared is 0.052. Yeah, exactly. So sqrt(0.0518) is approximately 0.2277. So ~0.228. \n\nLooking at the options: the closest is option D (0.32), B (0.07), C (0.11), or A (0.39). Hmm, none of these are close to 0.23.",

Of that, 20% (0.2 * 2\u03c0R\u00b2) is spots, and 80% is normal.\n\nSo the flux from the visible hemisphere is:\n\nF_min = (0.2 * 2\u03c0R\u00b2)*(5000)^4 + (0.8 * 2\u03c0R\u00b2)*(6000)^4 \n\nSimilarly, when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, all of the visible hemisphere is normal:\n\nF_max = (2\u03c0R\u00b2)*(6000)^4 \n\nThe amplitude of the light curve (the variation) would be (F_max - F_min)/something. Typically, the amplitude is (F_max - F_min)/F_avg or sometimes just F_max - F_min. Let me see.\n\nThe question says \"the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!)\". So comparing the variation caused by spots to that caused by a planet transit.\n\nThe amplitude due to the spots would be the difference between F_max and F_min divided by the average flux, perhaps.

Let me compute that.\n\nThe total surface area is 4\u03c0R\u00b2. The spotted area is 20% of one hemisphere (which is 2\u03c0R\u00b2), so 0.2*(2\u03c0R\u00b2) = 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2. The rest of the star (4\u03c0R\u00b2 - 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2) = 3.6\u03c0R\u00b2 is at Teff. The spotted area (0.4\u03c0R\u00b2) is at T_spot = 5000 K.\n\nThus, total L = \u03c3 [ (3.6\u03c0R\u00b2)(Teff^4) + (0.4\u03c0R\u00b2)(T_spot)^4 ]\n\nBut maybe the problem is considering that the effective temperature given is the average over the entire star, but perhaps the question wants us to approximate the variation caused by the spots when rotating, regardless of the star's actual total luminosity. Since the problem states that the star has a Teff of 6000 K, perhaps we can treat the spots as perturbations on a star with that Teff, so the non-spotted regions are at 6000 K, and spots at 5000 K.\n\nTherefore, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the visible hemisphere has 20% spots (on that hemisphere's area) and 80% normal. The flux observed would be the sum of the contributions from those regions in the visible hemisphere.\n\nLet me compute the flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us (leading to minimum flux) and when the unspotted is facing (maximum flux).\n\nFirst, the flux when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us: that hemisphere has no spots, so the entire visible hemisphere (2\u03c0R\u00b2) is at Teff. The flux from that hemisphere is F_normal = \u03c3 * (2\u03c0R\u00b2) * Teff^4.\n\nThe flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us: the visible hemisphere's area is divided into spots and normal regions. The spots are 20% of the hemisphere's area (so 0.2*2\u03c0R\u00b2 = 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2 at T_spot), and the rest (1.6\u03c0R\u00b2) at Teff. Thus the flux is F_spot = \u03c3*(0.4\u03c0R\u00b2)*(T_spot)^4 + \u03c3*(1.6\u03c0R\u00b2)*(Teff)^4.\n\nThe difference in flux between these two is \u0394F = F_normal - F_spot.\n\nThe amplitude of the variation is this \u0394F divided by the average flux?

For the spots, when the spotted hemisphere is facing, the flux is F_spot, which is less than F_normal. The variation amplitude would be (F_normal - F_spot)/F_normal. Since when the unspotted is facing, that's the maximum flux, and when the spotted is facing, it's the minimum. So the amplitude is (F_normal - F_spot)/F_normal.",

So the total flux variation is between two states: when the spots are visible (so 20% of the visible hemisphere is spots) and when they are not (so the entire visible is at full temperature).\n\nSo the maximum flux when spots are not visible is when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, so flux is just the star's normal flux. When the spotty hemisphere is facing us, 20% of the hemisphere is cooler spots, and 80% is at Teff.\n\nThe difference in flux between these two states is the amplitude of the variation. \n\nLet me compute the flux in both cases. \n\nFirst, the total flux when the spots are on the visible side: \n\nThe visible hemisphere has an area of 2\u03c0R\u00b2 (since the star is spherical, each hemisphere is half the surface area).

So maybe the question is considering that the spots are on one hemisphere, but when calculating the light curve variation, the amplitude is the difference between when the spots are visible versus not, relative to the average luminosity?\n\nHmm, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that when the spots are visible, the luminosity decreases, and when they are hidden, it increases, so the amplitude is the difference between those two states. Let's try that approach.\n\nThe total luminosity when the spotted hemisphere is facing us (so the spots are in view) would be:\n\nL1 = (Area_spots * T_spot^4 + (Area_spotted_hemisphere - Area_spots) * T_non_spot^4 + Area_opposite_hemisphere * T_non_spot^4)",

The total flux when the spots are facing us is:\n\nF_spotty = (0.2 * T_spot^4 + 0.8 * T_eff^4) * (A) * (proportionality constant).\n\nWhen the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the visible hemisphere has no spots, so all the area is at T_eff. Thus, F_normal = T_eff^4 * A * same constant.\n\nThe difference between these two is the amplitude. The amplitude (delta F) is F_spotty - F_normal. But since the light curve will oscillate, the maximum minus minimum would be (F_spotty - F_normal) and (F_normal - F_spotty) depending on orientation, so the total variation is twice the difference, but the amplitude is the peak-to-peak divided by 2, or the difference from the mean?",

Let me compute that.\n\nThe total surface area is 4\u03c0R\u00b2. The spotted area is 20% of one hemisphere (which is 2\u03c0R\u00b2), so 0.2*(2\u03c0R\u00b2) = 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2.

Since the problem states that the star has a Teff of 6000 K, perhaps we can treat the spots as perturbations on a star with that Teff, so the non-spotted regions are at 6000 K, and spots at 5000 K.\n\nTherefore, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the visible hemisphere has 20% spots (on that hemisphere's area) and 80% normal. The flux observed would be the sum of the contributions from those regions in the visible hemisphere.\n\nLet me compute the flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us (leading to minimum flux) and when the unspotted is facing (maximum flux).\n\nFirst, the flux when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us: that hemisphere has no spots, so the entire visible hemisphere (2\u03c0R\u00b2) is at Teff. The flux from that hemisphere is F_normal = \u03c3 * (2\u03c0R\u00b2) * Teff^4.\n\nThe flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us: the visible hemisphere's area is divided into spots and normal regions. The spots are 20% of the hemisphere's area (so 0.2*2\u03c0R\u00b2 = 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2 at T_spot), and the rest (1.6\u03c0R\u00b2) at Teff. Thus the flux is F_spot = \u03c3*(0.4\u03c0R\u00b2)*(T_spot)^4 + \u03c3*(1.6\u03c0R\u00b2)*(Teff)^4.\n\nThe difference in flux between these two is \u0394F = F_normal - F_spot.\n\nThe amplitude of the variation is this \u0394F divided by the average flux? Or over the maximum? Let me see.\n\nThe amplitude of the light curve is usually given as the depth of the dip divided by the out-of-transit flux. For the spots, when the spotted hemisphere is facing, the flux is F_spot, which is less than F_normal. The variation amplitude would be (F_normal - F_spot)/F_normal. Since when the unspotted is facing, that's the maximum flux, and when the spotted is facing, it's the minimum. So the amplitude is (F_normal - F_spot)/F_normal.",

The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. When that hemisphere is facing us, the flux from that hemisphere is reduced by the spots. The fractional reduction would be the (area fraction of spots) * (1 - (T_spot / T)^4 ), because each spot contributes less flux than the surrounding area.\n\nTherefore, the fractional change in flux when the spots are facing us is: \n\n\u0394F/F = (0.2) * [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]\n\nBecause 20% of the hemisphere is cooler, each spot area has a flux of (5000/6000)^4 times the normal flux.

But since the spots are dark, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is lower than when it's not. \n\nThe amplitude of the variation would be the difference between the maximum and minimum flux divided by the average. Let me model this.\n\nLet me denote T_eff as the effective temperature of the star without spots, 6000 K. The spots are 1000 K cooler, so their temperature is 5000 K. The flux from a blackbody is proportional to T^4. So the flux from a spot compared to the surrounding is (5000/6000)^4 \u2248 (5/6)^4 \u2248 (0.8333)^4.

So the amplitude would be (F2 - F1)/F2 * 100% perhaps, but for the purpose of calculating equivalent transit depth, we need the ratio (F2 - F1)/F2. The transit depth is (R_pl/R_star)^2, which is the fractional decrease in flux when the planet is in front. So in the spots case, the maximum decrease is F2 - F1, so the fractional decrease is (F2 - F1)/F2 = 1 - F1/F2.\n\nCalculating F1 and F2:\n\nF_normal is the flux per unit area of the normal part of the star (without spots). F_spot is the flux per unit area of the spots. The ratio F_spot/F_normal is (T_spot/T_normal)^4. Since T_spot = 5000 K, T_normal = 6000 K, so (5/6)^4 \u2248 0.482, as before.\n\nSo F_spot = F_normal * 0.482.\n\nTherefore, F1 = 0.8 * F_normal + 0.2 * 0.482*F_normal = F_normal*(0.8 + 0.2*0.482) = F_normal*(0.8 + 0.0964) = F_normal * 0.8964.\n\nF2 = F_normal (since all the visible disk is normal).\n\nSo the fractional decrease when the spots are present is (F2 - F1)/F2 = (F_normal - 0.8964 F_normal)/F_normal = 1 - 0.8964 = 0.1036, or about 10.36%.\n\nTherefore, the amplitude of the variation due to the spots is about 10.36%.\n\nNow, the question is: what planet radius would cause the same amplitude in the light curve? The transit depth is (R_pl / R_star)^2. So we need (R_pl / R_star)^2 = 0.1036, so R_pl/R_star = sqrt(0.1036) \u2248 sqrt(0.1036). Let me compute that.\n\nsqrt(0.1) is about 0.316, sqrt(0.1024) is 0.32 (since 0.32\u00b2=0.1024). Since 0.1036 is a bit higher, maybe around 0.322? Let me compute 0.322 squared: 0.322 * 0.322 = 0.103684. Oh, exactly! So sqrt(0.1036) is approximately 0.322. So that would give R_pl/R_star \u2248 0.322, which is close to option D (0.32). But let me check the options again.\n\nLooking at the options: A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32. So D is the closest.",

The total flux observed is the integral over the visible hemisphere's surface elements multiplied by their temperature to the fourth. \n\nSo the flux when the spotty side is facing is:\n\nF_spotty = (T_spot^4 * A_spots_visible) + (T_eff^4 * A_normal_visible)\n\nWhere A_spots_visible = 0.4 \u03c0R\u00b2, A_normal_visible = 1.6 \u03c0R\u00b2.\n\nThus, F_spotty = [0.4 \u03c0R\u00b2 * T_spot^4] + [1.6 \u03c0R\u00b2 * T_eff^4]\n\nThe flux when the non-spotty side is facing is F_normal = 2\u03c0R\u00b2 * T_eff^4 (since the visible hemisphere has no spots).\n\nSo the maximum flux F_max = F_normal = 2\u03c0R\u00b2 T_eff^4.\n\nThe minimum flux F_min = F_spotty = (0.4 \u03c0R\u00b2 T_spot^4) + (1.6 \u03c0R\u00b2 T_eff^4).\n\nThe difference between F_max and F_min is:\n\n\u0394F = F_max - F_min = 2\u03c0R\u00b2 T_eff^4 - [0.4 \u03c0R\u00b2 T_spot^4 + 1.6 \u03c0R\u00b2 T_eff^4 ]\n\n= 2\u03c0R\u00b2 T_eff^4 - 1.6 \u03c0R\u00b2 T_eff^4 - 0.4 \u03c0R\u00b2 T_spot^4 \n\n= (0.4 \u03c0R\u00b2 T_eff^4) - 0.4 \u03c0R\u00b2 T_spot^4 \n\n= 0.4 \u03c0R\u00b2 ( T_eff^4 - T_spot^4 )\n\nSo \u0394F = 0.4 \u03c0R\u00b2 ( T_eff^4 - T_spot^4 )\n\nThe average flux F_avg = (F_max + F_min)/2\n\nLet me compute F_avg:\n\nF_avg = [2\u03c0R\u00b2 T_eff^4 + (0.4 \u03c0R\u00b2 T_spot^4 + 1.6 \u03c0R\u00b2 T_eff^4 ) ] / 2 \n\n= [ (2 +1.6) \u03c0R\u00b2 T_eff^4 + 0.4 \u03c0R\u00b2 T_spot^4 ] / 2 \n\n= [ 3.6 \u03c0R\u00b2 T_eff^4 + 0.4 \u03c0R\u00b2 T_spot^4 ] / 2 \n\nBut maybe it's easier to compute in terms of F_max and F_min.",

So (5/6)^4 \u2248 0.4823.\n\nSo F_spot \u2248 0.4823 * F_normal.\n\nThus, F_with = 0.2*(0.4823 F_normal) + 0.8*(F_normal) = (0.2*0.4823 + 0.8) * F_normal\n\nCalculate 0.2*0.4823 = 0.09646. Adding to 0.8 gives 0.89646. So F_with \u2248 0.89646 F_normal.\n\nTherefore, the fractional decrease when the spots are present is (F_normal - F_with)/F_normal = (1 - 0.89646) \u2248 0.10354, so about 10.35% dip.",

Because the spots are always present on the star, so the total flux emitted by the star doesn't change with rotation. The light curve variation is due to the observer seeing different parts of the star's surface as it rotates. Therefore, the total flux observed is the average over the visible hemisphere's temperature. \n\nTherefore, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the visible hemisphere has spots; when it's not, the visible hemisphere has no spots. The total emitted flux of the star is constant, but the observed flux (from our viewpoint) varies depending on which side is facing us. \n\nTherefore, the observed flux is the integral over the visible hemisphere's surface of the flux from each region. The amplitude of the variation is the difference between when the spots are visible and when they are not. \n\nSo let's compute that.\n\nThe flux from the visible hemisphere when the spots are not visible (i.e., the spotted hemisphere is on the far side):\n\nThe visible hemisphere is unspotted. The flux from that hemisphere is (2\u03c0R\u00b2) * \u03c3 T_eff^4.\n\nThe flux when the spots are visible (spotted hemisphere is facing us):\n\nThe visible hemisphere has the spots. The area with spots is 0.2 * 2\u03c0R\u00b2 = 0.4 \u03c0 R\u00b2, and the rest is 1.6 \u03c0 R\u00b2 at T_eff.

So the total flux variation is between two states: when the spots are visible (so 20% of the visible hemisphere is spots) and when they are not (so the entire visible is at full temperature).\n\nSo the maximum flux when spots are not visible is when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, so flux is just the star's normal flux. When the spotty hemisphere is facing us, 20% of the hemisphere is cooler spots, and 80% is at Teff.\n\nThe difference in flux between these two states is the amplitude of the variation. \n\nLet me compute the flux in both cases. \n\nFirst, the total flux when the spots are on the visible side: \n\nThe visible hemisphere has an area of 2\u03c0R\u00b2 (since the star is spherical, each hemisphere is half the surface area).

The opposite hemisphere's contribution is not visible, so it doesn't matter for the observed flux.\n\nWhen the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us, the visible hemisphere has no spots, so all of it is at 6000K.\n\nThus, the observed flux when spotted hemisphere is visible (F1):\n\nF1 = (Area_spots * T_spot^4 + Area_non_spots_visible * T_non_spot^4 ) * \u03c3\n\nArea_spots =0.2*(2\u03c0R\u00b2) =0.4\u03c0R\u00b2.\n\nArea_non_spots_visible = 2\u03c0R\u00b2 - 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2=1.6\u03c0R\u00b2.\n\nThus,\n\nF1 = [0.4\u03c0R\u00b2 * (5000)^4 +1.6\u03c0R\u00b2*(6000)^4] * \u03c3\n\nF1 = \u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3 [0.4*(5000)^4 +1.6*(6000)^4 ]\n\nF2 (when non-spotted hemisphere is visible):\n\nF2 = (2\u03c0R\u00b2)*(6000)^4 *\u03c3\n\nSo, now compute F1 and F2 correctly.\n\nCompute T_s^4 =5000^4 =6.25e14 K^4.\n\nT_n^4 =6000^4=1.296e15 K^4.\n\nNow compute F1:\n\n0.4 *6.25e14 = 2.5e14,\n\n1.6 *1.296e15 = 2.0736e15.\n\nAdding those terms:\n\n2.5e14 +2.0736e15 = 2.5e14 +20.736e14 =23.236e14.\n\nF1 = 23.236e14 * \u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3.\n\nF2 =2*(1.296e15) =2.592e15 * \u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3.\n\nTherefore, the difference F2-F1:\n\n2.592e15 -23.236e14 = (25.92e14 -23.236e14) =2.684e14.\n\nThe amplitude (as a fraction of the average flux):\n\nAmplitude = (F2 - F1)/(F1 + F2).\n\nF1 + F2 =23.236e14 +25.92e14 =49.156e14.\n\nThus,\n\nAmplitude =2.684e14 /49.156e14 \u22480.0546, which is ~5.46%.\n\nAh! So the amplitude from the spots is about 5.46%.\n\nNow, the transit depth required to match this is 5.46%, which would mean (R_pl/R_star)^2 =0.0546 \u2192 R_pl/R_star = sqrt(0.0546) \u22480.2336.",

So the total spotted area is 20% of the hemisphere's area. \n\nNow, the temperature of the spots is 1000K cooler than the effective temperature of 6000K. So the spots are at 5000K. The effective temperature of a star is related to its luminosity. The luminosity of a star is proportional to its surface area and the fourth power of its temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law). So when a spot is present, the luminosity contribution from that area is lower. \n\nTo compute the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots, we can model it as follows. Let's assume the star without spots has a luminosity L. The presence of spots reduces the luminosity when the spots are facing us. Let me think in terms of the fractional change in brightness.\n\nThe total luminosity of the star would be the sum of the luminosity from the non-spotted regions and the spotted regions. Since the spots are on one hemisphere, which is 50% of the surface. But the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 of the total surface area?",

That makes sense. So the total spotted area is 10% of the star's surface.\n\nNow, the spots are cooler than the rest of the star. The temperature of the spots is Teff - 1000 K, so 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K. The brightness variation comes from the difference in luminosity between the spots and the normal regions. Since luminosity depends on temperature to the fourth power (Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = \u03c3T^4 * area), the flux from the spots will be lower.\n\nThe total flux from the star when a spot is on the visible hemisphere would decrease.
