Aluminum isopropoxide is often used in aldol condensation reactions as a catalyst. In an aldol condensation between two ketone groups, the product would be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. \n\nIf the two carbonyls are adjacent, then the aldol condensation between them would form a conjugated enone. Let's see: \n\nSuppose the two ketones are on carbons 1 and 2 (adjacent). The aldol condensation would proceed by deprotonation of the alpha carbon of one ketone (carbon 2, adjacent to the second ketone?), forming an enolate which attacks the carbonyl of the other ketone. This would form a new carbon-carbon double bond, and eliminate a water molecule, resulting in a conjugated dienone system.",

For instance, in ethyl acetate, the CH2 adjacent to carbonyl is around 4.1 ppm. So 4.79 might be possible. \n\nSo product 1 has two carbonyls. Each carbonyl has a CH2 adjacent. Those CH2 groups would give the 4.79 peak.
