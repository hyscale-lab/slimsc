The decay occurs after the particle has traveled some distance. If the detector's resolution is too low (i.e., each \"pixel\" or detection element is too large), then for particles that decay very close to their origin, the decay point might not be distinguishable from the origin. So the detector needs a resolution small enough so that the decay is observed as a separate track. To have at least 30% observed, we need the resolution to be smaller than the distance traveled by the 30% percentile of the decay times.\n\nThe decay process is exponential: the probability that the particle decays before time t is 1 - exp(-t/\u03c4). To have 30% decayed, set 1 - exp(-t/\u03c4) = 0.3 \u2192 exp(-t/\u03c4) = 0.7 \u2192 -t/\u03c4 = ln(0.7) \u2192 t = -\u03c4 ln(0.7). Let me compute that.\n\nln(0.7) is approximately -0.35667.

Let me compute that more accurately. \n\n2.976 *6 = 17.856, 2.976 *0.336 = 2.976*0.3 = 0.8928, plus 2.976*0.036 = 0.107136. Total of 0.8928 +0.107136 = 1.0 (approx). So total 17.856 + 1.0 = 18.856. \n\nSo 18.856e-7 meters. 1e-7 meters is 0.1 micrometers, so 18.856e-7 m is 1.8856e-6 meters. So ~1.89e-6 meters. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6, which is close. The discrepancy might be due to more precise calculations. Let me check if I made a mistake in the velocity calculation.",

The decay occurs after the particle has traveled some distance. If the detector's resolution is too low (i.e., each \"pixel\" or detection element is too large), then for particles that decay very close to their origin, the decay point might not be distinguishable from the origin. So the detector needs a resolution small enough so that the decay is observed as a separate track. To have at least 30% observed, we need the resolution to be smaller than the distance traveled by the 30% percentile of the decay times.\n\nThe decay process is exponential: the probability that the particle decays before time t is 1 - exp(-t/\u03c4). To have 30% decayed, set 1 - exp(-t/\u03c4) = 0.3 \u2192 exp(-t/\u03c4) = 0.7 \u2192 -t/\u03c4 = ln(0.7) \u2192 t = -\u03c4 ln(0.7). Let me compute that.\n\nln(0.7) is approximately -0.35667.

The detector's resolution must be at least as good as the distance corresponding to t where P(t)=0.3. \n\nLet me work through that. \n\nWe need to find t such that 1 - exp(-t/\u03c4) = 0.3 \u2192 exp(-t/\u03c4) = 0.7 \u2192 -t/\u03c4 = ln(0.7) \u2192 t = - \u03c4 ln(0.7). \n\nCalculating ln(0.7) \u2248 -0.35667. So t \u2248 - (\u03c4) * (-0.35667) \u2248 \u03c4 *0.35667. \n\nThen the distance is v * t = v * \u03c4 *0.35667.",

That's very close to the option A (2.08e-6). The slight difference may be due to rounding.\n\nAh! So this must be the correct approach.

So this gives \u03b3\u22488.9179 instead of 7.9179.\n\nThis would mean that the initial assumption was wrong. The problem says \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV\" \u2014probably meaning the kinetic energy, since total energy is usually written differently. Or perhaps the wording is ambiguous.

If the detector's resolution is too low (i.e., each \"pixel\" or detection element is too large), then for particles that decay very close to their origin, the decay point might not be distinguishable from the origin.

The problem says \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV\" \u2014probably meaning the kinetic energy, since total energy is usually written differently. Or perhaps the wording is ambiguous.

Let me interpolate:\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that x = sqrt(0.98743).\n\nWe have x1=0.9936 gives x1\u00b2=0.98724,\n\nx2=0.9937 gives x2\u00b2\u22480.9876 (as before, 0.9937^2=0.987596).\n\nThe target is 0.98743.\n\nThe difference between target and x1\u00b2 is 0.98743-0.98724=0.00019,\n\nand between x2\u00b2 and target is 0.987596 -0.98743=0.000166.\n\nSo to reach 0.98743 from x1's 0.98724, need delta_x such that (0.9936 + delta_x)^2=0.98743.\n\nApproximate delta_x \u2248 (0.98743 -0.98724)/(2*0.9936) =0.00019/(1.9872)= ~0.0000956.\n\nSo x\u22480.9936 +0.0000956\u22480.993696.\n\nSo approximately 0.9937.\n\nThus, v \u22480.9937c.\n\nThus, v=0.9937 *3e8=2.981e8 m/s.\n\nThen, d= v * \u03c4 =2.981e8 *7.1343e-15 \u2248 let's compute 2.981 *7.1343 first.\n\n2.981 \u00d77 =20.867,\n\n2.981 \u00d70.1343 \u22480.3996,\n\nTotal \u224820.867+0.3996\u224821.2666.\n\nThus, 21.2666e-7 m =2.12666e-6 m, which is approximately 2.13e-6 m. The closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m. The slight difference might be due to more precise calculation steps or rounding in intermediate steps.\n\nGiven that the options have 2.08e-6, which is close to 2.13e-6, perhaps there was a miscalculation in the problem's numbers or rounding in the options.",

The decay occurs after the particle has traveled some distance. If the detector's resolution is too low (i.e., each \"pixel\" or detection element is too large), then for particles that decay very close to their origin, the decay point might not be distinguishable from the origin. So the detector needs a resolution small enough so that the decay is observed as a separate track. To have at least 30% observed, we need the resolution to be smaller than the distance traveled by the 30% percentile of the decay times.\n\nThe decay process is exponential: the probability that the particle decays before time t is 1 - exp(-t/\u03c4). To have 30% decayed, set 1 - exp(-t/\u03c4) = 0.3 \u2192 exp(-t/\u03c4) = 0.7 \u2192 -t/\u03c4 = ln(0.7) \u2192 t = -\u03c4 ln(0.7). Let me compute that.\n\nln(0.7) is approximately -0.35667.

          "text1": "Wait, that might make sense. \n\nThe decay process follows an exponential distribution, where the probability that the particle decays before time t is 1 - exp(-t/\u03c4). So to capture 30% of decays, we need to find the time t where 1 - exp(-t/\u03c4) =0.3, so exp(-t/\u03c4) =0.7, so -t/\u03c4 = ln(0.7), so t= -\u03c4 ln(0.7). Then the distance would be v * t. \n\nAh! That's probably the key here. I think I made a mistake earlier by taking the mean lifetime. To get 30% of the decays, you need to consider the time by which 30% have decayed, not the average time. Because the average is the mean, but the question is about capturing at least 30%, so you set the decay probability to 0.3. \n\nSo let's recalculate with that approach. \n\nFirst, solve for t when the cumulative decay probability is 30%:\n\nP(t) = 1 - exp(-t/\u03c4) = 0.3  \nThus, exp(-t/\u03c4) =0.7  \nTake natural logarithm of both sides:  \n- t/\u03c4 = ln(0.7)  \nMultiply both sides by -\u03c4:  \nt = -\u03c4 ln(0.7)  \n\nCompute ln(0.7). Let's see, ln(0.7) \u2248 -0.35667. \n\nTherefore, t = -\u03c4*(-0.35667) = \u03c4*0.35667. \n\nSo t \u2248 0.35667 * \u03c4. \n\nSince \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080, then t \u22480.35667 * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. \n\nSo substituting \u03b3 \u22487.92, \u03c4\u2080 is 8e-16 s. \n\nCalculating t: 0.35667 *7.92*8e-16 \n\nFirst compute the constants: 0.35667 *7.92 \u2248?\n\n0.35667 *7 =2.49669, 0.35667*0.92\u22480.328. Total \u22482.49669+0.328\u22482.8247. \n\nThen multiply by 8e-16: 2.8247 *8 =22.5976e-16 seconds. \n\nSo t \u22482.25976e-15 seconds. \n\nThen, the distance is v*t. \n\nv is 0.992c. So v =0.992 *3e8 m/s =2.976e8 m/s. \n\nDistance d = 2.976e8 m/s * 2.25976e-15 s. \n\nCompute that: \n\nFirst multiply 2.976 *2.25976 \u2248 let's see:\n\n2 *2.25976 =4.51952\n\n0.976 *2.25976 \u2248 let's compute 1*2.25976 =2.25976 minus 0.024*2.25976 \u22480.05423.

So total gamma is 7.9 +0.0178 \u22487.9178.\n\nSo gamma is 7.9178.\n\nThus, \u03c4=7.9178 *8e-16 = 6.33424e-15 s.\n\nv is sqrt(1 - (1/7.9178)^2 )*c.\n\nCompute (1/7.9178)^2: 1/(7.9178)^2. 7.9178 squared is as before ~62.69, so 1/62.69=0.01595.\n\n1-0.01595=0.98405, sqrt is 0.9920.\n\nThus, v=0.9920c =0.992\u00d7299792458 m/s \u2248 297, 000,000 m/s (approx 2.97e8 m/s).\n\nSo v*tau = 2.97e8 m/s *6.33424e-15 s.\n\nMultiply 2.97e8 *6.33424e-15:\n\n2.97 *6.33424 \u2248?\n\n2 *6.33424=12.6685,\n\n0.97*6.33424=6.1442,\n\nTotal \u224812.6685+6.1442=18.8127.\n\nThus, 18.8127e-7 meters (since 10^8 *1e-15 =1e-7).\n\nSo 18.8127e-7 m =1.88127e-6 m. Approximately 1.88e-6 meters, which is 1.88 micrometers.\n\nThe closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m. Hmm, why is there a difference?",

That's approximately 2.1e-6 m, which is very close to option A (2.08e-6 m). \n\nAh! This makes sense. So the key point I missed was that the energy given in the problem might be the kinetic energy rather than the total energy. Since the question says \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV\", which is ambiguous. It could refer to the total energy or the kinetic energy. \n\nIn particle physics, when they say the energy of a particle, it's usually the total energy unless specified otherwise. But perhaps in some contexts, they might refer to kinetic energy. \n\nIf the energy is kinetic, then the total energy is indeed 30.41 GeV, leading to gamma\u22488.917 and decay length ~2.1e-6 m, which matches option A's 2.08e-6 m. \n\nGiven that, this is likely the correct approach. So the initial mistake was assuming the given energy is the total energy, but it's actually the kinetic energy. \n\nThus, recalculating with E = K + m\u2080c\u00b2:\n\nE_total =27 GeV (KE) +3.41 GeV (rest)=30.41 GeV.\n\nThen gamma is 30.41/3.41\u22488.917. \n\nThen tau =8.917\u00d78e-16=7.134e-15 s. \n\nVelocity v = sqrt(1- (m0c\u00b2/E_total)^2) = sqrt(1 - (3.41/30.41)^2) \n\n3.41/30.41 is ~0.1122, squared is ~0.0126. \n\n1-0.0126=0.9874 \u2192 sqrt(0.9874)\u22480.9937. \n\nv=0.9937c. \n\nThen decay length L_avg =v * tau =0.9937c *7.134e-15 s. \n\nc=3e8 m/s \u2192 0.9937\u00d73e8 = 2.981e8 m/s. \n\nMultiply by 7.134e-15 s: 2.981e8 *7.134e-15 =2.126e-6 m. \n\nWhich is approximately 2.08e-6 m (the given option A). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. \n\nThe confusion arose from whether the given energy is total or kinetic. Since the problem says \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV\", it's more likely referring to the total energy, but given that the calculation with kinetic energy gives the closest answer, maybe the question intended kinetic.
