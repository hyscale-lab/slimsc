The fluorine percentage is (x*19)/(M + x*19) = 0.3196. Let's rearrange this equation. Let me compute:\n\nx*19 = 0.3196*(M + 19x)\n\nx*19 = 0.3196*M + 0.3196*19x\n\nBring terms with x to one side:\n\nx*19 - 0.3196*19x = 0.3196*M\n\nx*19*(1 - 0.3196) = 0.3196*M\n\nSo 19x*(0.6804) = 0.3196*M\n\nThus, M = (19x *0.6804)/0.3196\n\nLet me compute that. Let's see, 0.6804/0.3196 \u2248 2.129. So M \u2248 19x *2.129.\n\nHmm, so the molar mass of Y is approximately 2.129 *19x. Let's see possible x values.\n\nAssuming that A2 is a fluoride with formula YFy, where y is less than the formula of A1 (since A1 decomposes into A2 and F2). Let me think. If A1 decomposes into A2 + F2, then A1 must have more fluorine atoms. For example, if A1 is YF5, then decomposition might produce YF3 (A2) plus F2 (since 5F - 3F = 2F). Then in that case, x for A2 would be 3. Plugging x=3 into the equation:\n\nM \u2248 19*3 *2.129 \u2248 57 *2.129 \u2248 121.0. Hmm, so Y would have a molar mass around 121. That would be around the atomic weight of Iodine (I is ~126.9). Close. Let me check with x=3 and Y as I.\n\nIf Y is I, then YF3 is IF3. Let's compute the fluorine percentage:\n\nF% = (3*19)/(126.9 + 3*19) = (57)/(126.9+57) = 57/183.9 \u2248 0.310, which is 31%, which matches the 31.96% given? Not exactly, but close. Maybe rounding?",

Let me call Y's atomic weight as M.\n\nSo (19y)/(M +19y)=0.3196 \u2192 19y = 0.3196(M +19y)\n\n19y = 0.3196M + 0.3196*19y\n\n19y - 0.3196*19y = 0.3196M\n\n19y(1 -0.3196) =0.3196 M \u2192 \n\n19y*(0.6804) = 0.3196 M \u2192 \n\nM = [19y *0.6804]/0.3196\n\nLet me compute that: 0.6804/0.3196 \u2248 2.129. So M \u2248 19y *2.129\n\nHmm. Let's see possible y values. Since A2 is a product of A1 decomposing into A2 and F2, so A1 must have more fluorine atoms than A2. Let's assume that A1 has y+2 fluorine atoms (since F2 is released). For example, if A2 is YFy, then A1 would be YF(y+2). So the decomposition is YF(y+2) \u2192 YFy + F2. That makes sense.\n\nSo the formula of A1 is YF(y+2), A2 is YFy. The percentage of F in A2 is given as 31.96%.\n\nLet me try possible y values. Let me try y=2.

That's around bromine (79.9) or maybe arsenic (74.9), but 80.9 is close to bromine. \n\nIf y=2 and M\u224880.9, then Y could be bromine. \n\nLet me check for y=2:\n\nIf Y is Br (atomic mass ~80), then for YF2: \n\nF% would be (2*19)/(80 +38)= 38/118 \u224832.2%, which is close to the given 31.96%.

The mass percent of F is (19y)/(M +19y) = 31.96% or 0.3196.\n\nSo solving for (19y)/(M +19y) = 0.3196 \u2192 19y = 0.3196(M +19y) \u2192 19y = 0.3196 M + 0.3196*19y \u2192 19y - 0.3196*19y = 0.3196 M \u2192 19y(1 -0.3196) = 0.3196 M \u2192 \n\nLet me compute 1 -0.3196 = 0.6804. So 19y *0.6804 = 0.3196 M \u2192 M = (19*0.6804 /0.3196) * y",

If A1 decomposes into A2 + F2, then A1 must have more fluorine atoms. For example, if A1 is YF5, then decomposition might produce YF3 (A2) plus F2 (since 5F - 3F = 2F).
