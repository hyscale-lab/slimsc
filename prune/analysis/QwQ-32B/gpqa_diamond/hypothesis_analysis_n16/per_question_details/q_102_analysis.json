The options are about why that happens. Let's look at the options again:\n\nA) ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means signaling between nearby cells. If they were paracrine, maybe the interaction isn't happening, but the question is about the expression of eGFP, which should be present regardless of ligand-receptor interaction. Since the eGFP is fused to the receptor, if the receptor isn't expressed, that's the issue. But A might not explain the lack of eGFP.\n\nB) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If the receptor is stuck in the Golgi, maybe it's not transported to the cell surface, but the eGFP should still be present (maybe intracellular). The question says they don't observe green, so maybe it's not being made at all. So B could be possible, but maybe not the best answer.\n\nC) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. The construct is homozygous, so the promoters should be there. The CBA promoter is for the ligand, but the receptor's expression via IRES? If the enhancer is missing, maybe the CBA promoter isn't active. But the ligand's promoter is CBA, which is a constitutive promoter, so maybe that's not the issue. Unless the IRES requires an enhancer, but I'm not sure.\n\nD) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame. If the stop wasn't removed between them, then the eGFP isn't translated. So if the Cre didn't remove that stop, the receptor's stop would end translation before eGFP. So that would mean the eGFP isn't expressed because it's not in frame (since the stop remains, the eGFP isn't part of the ORF).",

So the receptor is expressed as receptor alone unless Cre removes the stop, allowing it to be fused to eGFP. \n\nNow the question is, when they crossed the construct with SOX10-Cre, they don't see green (eGFP). Why?\n\nPossible options:\n\nOption D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop was removed, then the receptor's C-terminal would be fused to eGFP. If the stop is removed, but the reading frame between the receptor and eGFP is wrong, then the fusion protein would be messed up. The stop was in between, so when Cre removes it, the receptor's stop is gone, so translation continues into the eGFP. If the sequences are in frame, then the receptor-eGFP would be made. But if they are out of frame, then the eGFP wouldn't be properly translated, so no GFP signal. That's a possibility.\n\nOption B: the receptor-eGFP is stuck in Golgi. Maybe the receptor is a transmembrane protein, so maybe it's retained there, but then you might still see some signal in the cell. Unless it's not making it to the cell surface. But the question says they don't see green at all. So maybe it's not being expressed.\n\nOption C says the enhancer is missing. But the construct is bicistronic, so maybe the promoters are there.
