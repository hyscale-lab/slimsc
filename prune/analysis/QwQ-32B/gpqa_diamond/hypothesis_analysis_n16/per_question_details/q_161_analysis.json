But electrons are charged, so their interactions can be over longer distances. \n\nHmm, perhaps I should think of it this way: the cross-section for two neutral molecules colliding is determined by their physical size, so when they touch, they collide. For an electron and a molecule, the electron can be deflected even when it's far away from the molecule, due to the electric field. So the effective cross-section for scattering could be much larger. \n\nFor example, the Rutherford scattering cross-section for an electron passing near a charged nucleus is (Ze)^4/(16\u03b50^2 m e^4 v^4) something like that, but the point is that the cross-section can be larger than the physical size.",

For example, in Rutherford scattering, the cross-section for alpha particles depends on the charge and the energy. The cross-section here for electron-gas molecule could be due to things like Coulomb interactions. \n\nThe gas molecules are neutral, but the electron has a charge. The interaction between an electron and a neutral molecule might involve induction or dipole effects.
