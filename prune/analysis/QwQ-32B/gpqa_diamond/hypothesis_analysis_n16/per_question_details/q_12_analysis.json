Let me try to set up the equation properly.\n\nLet me denote m_\u03c0 = 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2, m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2. The neutrino mass is neglected, so m_nu \u2248 0.\n\nTotal energy conservation:\n\nm_\u03c0 c\u00b2 = E_mu + E_nu\n\nMomentum conservation: since initial momentum is zero, p_mu + p_nu = 0.

Let me set variables in terms of energy. Let me let x = p c (so units of energy, since p c has units of energy, like MeV). Then the equation becomes:\n\nm_\u03c0 = sqrt( x\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 ) + x",

Because E_nu squared equals (0)^2 + p_nu squared, so E_nu = p_nu.\n\nSo from momentum conservation, p_mu = p_nu = E_nu.\n\nLet me write the equations again:\n\nE_mu = sqrt(m_mu^2 + p_mu^2) = sqrt(105.7\u00b2 + p_mu\u00b2)\n\nE_nu = p_nu = p_mu (since p_mu = p_nu)\n\nSo, the total energy equation is:\n\nsqrt(105.7\u00b2 + p_mu\u00b2) + p_mu = 139.6\n\nHmm, so I need to solve for p_mu here.\n\nLet me denote p_mu as x for simplicity.

Then the energy equation becomes:\n\nE_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.\n\nThe momentum conservation requires that the muon's momentum p_mu is equal in magnitude to the neutrino's momentum p_nu, but opposite in direction, so their magnitudes are equal. Since neutrino is massless, E_nu = p_nu. So p_nu = E_nu. \n\nThe muon's energy is sqrt( p_mu\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 ), where p_mu = p_nu (since magnitude same). So:\n\nE_mu = sqrt( p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2 )\n\nE_nu = p \n\nSo total energy equation:\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2) + p = 139.6 \n\nWhich is exactly the equation I had before. \n\nSo solving that gives p \u224829.78 MeV/c (since in natural units, c=1, so p is in MeV/c, but when multiplied by c, that gives MeV for energy terms). \n\nSo the neutrino's energy is p \u224829.78 MeV. \n\nThe muon's energy is sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ). Let me calculate that. \n\nFirst, (29.78)^2 \u2248 886.8 \n\n(105.7)^2 = 11172.49 \n\nAdding those gives 11172.49 +886.8 \u2248 12059.29 \n\nTaking the square root: sqrt(12059.29). Let's see, sqrt(12059) is about 109.8. Because 110^2 is 12100, so sqrt(12059) is a bit less, like 109.8. Let me check 109.8 squared: 109^2 is 11881, 0.8 squared is 0.64, cross term 2*109*0.8=174.4. So 109.8^2 = (109 +0.8)^2 = 109\u00b2 + 2*109*0.8 +0.8\u00b2 = 11881 + 174.4 +0.64 = 12056.04. Close to 12059.29. \n\nSo sqrt(12059.29) \u2248109.8 (since the difference is about 3.25). So approximately 109.8 MeV. \n\nTherefore, the muon's energy is 109.8 MeV. \n\nThe rest mass energy of the muon is 105.7, so the kinetic energy is E - m_mu c\u00b2 = 109.8 -105.7 = 4.1 MeV. \n\nThe neutrino's energy is p \u224829.78 MeV, so its kinetic energy is the same (since massless), 29.78 MeV.",
