The ethyl group has (CH2CH3) which has 5 H (since the ethyl group is -CH2CH3, so the CH2 has 2 H and the CH3 has 3 H). So each ethyl adds 5 H but takes away one H from the benzene.

That matches the required formula. \n\nSimilarly, 1,4-diethylbenzene would have two ethyl groups. Each ethyl is -CH2CH3. Each ethyl adds 2 carbons and 5 hydrogens (since replacing one H on the benzene with an ethyl group: the ethyl has 2 C and 5 H (since each ethyl is CH2CH3: total 2 C and 5 H (2+3)). So two ethyl groups add 4 C and 10 H. Benzene is C6H6. So total C is 6+4=10, H is 6 -2 (because two substitutions) + 10 (from the ethyls) = 6-2=4 +10=14. So diethylbenzene is also C10H14. So all the compounds listed in the options are indeed C10H14. So that's good.\n\nNow, the NMR data: two singlets at ~6.7 ppm in 1:1 ratio, and three signals at ~2.2 ppm (all singlets) in 2:1:1 ratio. \n\nFirst, the aromatic protons.

So if each has a single peak, then the total integrals would be the sum of each compound's contribution.

So total H would be 6 -4 (because each methyl takes one H) plus 4\u00d73 H from the methyls. So: (6 -4) + (4\u00d73) = 2 +12 =14. So the molecular formula for each tetramethylbenzene would be C10H14. That matches the required formula. \n\nSimilarly, 1,4-diethylbenzene would have two ethyl groups. Each ethyl is -CH2CH3. Each ethyl adds 2 carbons and 5 hydrogens (since replacing one H on the benzene with an ethyl group: the ethyl has 2 C and 5 H (since each ethyl is CH2CH3: total 2 C and 5 H (2+3)). So two ethyl groups add 4 C and 10 H. Benzene is C6H6. So total C is 6+4=10, H is 6 -2 (because two substitutions) + 10 (from the ethyls) = 6-2=4 +10=14. So diethylbenzene is also C10H14. So all the compounds listed in the options are indeed C10H14.

Let's break that down.\n\nFirst, the aromatic protons: the 6.7 ppm signals. Since the compounds are tetramethylbenzenes or diethylbenzene. Let's think about the substituents. The aromatic protons would be the hydrogens on the benzene ring not substituted. Each methyl group is a substituent. Now, in a tetramethylbenzene, how many aromatic hydrogens are there?",

Each ethyl adds 2 carbons and 5 hydrogens (since replacing one H on the benzene with an ethyl group: the ethyl has 2 C and 5 H (since each ethyl is CH2CH3: total 2 C and 5 H (2+3)). So two ethyl groups add 4 C and 10 H. Benzene is C6H6. So total C is 6+4=10, H is 6 -2 (because two substitutions) + 10 (from the ethyls) = 6-2=4 +10=14. So diethylbenzene is also C10H14. So all the compounds listed in the options are indeed C10H14.

So the tetramethylbenzenes have formula C10H14. That's correct. So the four methyl groups each contribute net +2 H, so total H is 6 +4*2=14. So the tetramethylbenzenes have the correct formula. \n\nThen 1,4-diethylbenzene: each ethyl group is -CH2CH3. Each ethyl group would substitute a H on benzene. Let's see. Each ethyl group has two carbons. So two ethyl groups: each contributes 2 carbons, so total carbons: 6 + 2*2 =10. For hydrogens: each ethyl group adds (2+3) =5 H (since the ethyl group is CH2CH3; the first CH2 has two H, the second has three.

So each ethyl group contributes a net of (5 H) - 1 (the H replaced) but actually, the calculation is: original H on benzene is 6. For each ethyl group, replacing one H with the ethyl group. The ethyl group has (CH2CH3) which has 5 H (since the ethyl group is -CH2CH3, so the CH2 has 2 H and the CH3 has 3 H). So each ethyl adds 5 H but takes away one H from the benzene.

The question states that there are two signals at around 6.7 ppm (singlets in 1:1 ratio) and three signals at 2.2 ppm (all singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio). Let's break that down.\n\nFirst, the aromatic protons: the 6.7 ppm signals. Since the compounds are tetramethylbenzenes or diethylbenzene. Let's think about the substituents. The aromatic protons would be the hydrogens on the benzene ring not substituted. Each methyl group is a substituent. Now, in a tetramethylbenzene, how many aromatic hydrogens are there?",

So total H would be 6 -4 (because each methyl takes one H) plus 4\u00d73 H from the methyls. So: (6 -4) + (4\u00d73) = 2 +12 =14. So the molecular formula for each tetramethylbenzene would be C10H14. That matches the required formula. \n\nSimilarly, 1,4-diethylbenzene would have two ethyl groups. Each ethyl is -CH2CH3. Each ethyl adds 2 carbons and 5 hydrogens (since replacing one H on the benzene with an ethyl group: the ethyl has 2 C and 5 H (since each ethyl is CH2CH3: total 2 C and 5 H (2+3)). So two ethyl groups add 4 C and 10 H. Benzene is C6H6. So total C is 6+4=10, H is 6 -2 (because two substitutions) + 10 (from the ethyls) = 6-2=4 +10=14. So diethylbenzene is also C10H14. So all the compounds listed in the options are indeed C10H14. So that's good.\n\nNow, the NMR data: two singlets at ~6.7 ppm in 1:1 ratio, and three signals at ~2.2 ppm (all singlets) in 2:1:1 ratio. \n\nFirst, the aromatic protons.
