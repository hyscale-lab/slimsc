The [Ca\u00b2+] and [EDTA] are both x.\n\n- So solving x^2/(0.02) = 1/(5e10) \u2192 x is sqrt(0.02/(5e10)) \u2192 sqrt(2e-2/(5e10)) \u2192 sqrt( (2/5)*1e-12) \u2192 sqrt(0.4e-12) \u2192 sqrt(4e-13) \u2192 2e-6.5 \u2192 6.3e-7.\n\nYes, that seems right.

The concentration of the complex would then be 0.02 M minus the amount dissociated, but if K is very large, the dissociation is minimal, so maybe we can approximate [CaEDTA] \u2248 0.02 M.\n\nSo, substituting into the Kf expression:\n\nKf = [CaEDTA\u00b2-]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-]) \n\nPlugging in, 5e10 = (0.02 - x)/(x * x). But since K is huge, x is very small, so 0.02 -x \u2248 0.02. Therefore:\n\n5e10 \u2248 0.02/(x\u00b2)\n\nSolving for x\u00b2 = 0.02/(5e10) \n\nx\u00b2 = 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5)*1e-12 \n\n2 divided by 5 is 0.4, so 0.4e-12 \u2192 4e-13. \n\nTaking square root: x = sqrt(4e-13) \u2192 2e-6.5 \u2192 2e-6.5 is 2/(10^6.5).",
          "text2": "Wait, but how do I set this up? Let me think. Let me denote [Ca\u00b2+] as x. Since the complex dissociates into Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4-, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x. The concentration of the complex itself would be approximately 0.02 M minus x, but since K is so large (5e10), x will be very small, so we can approximate [Ca-EDTA] \u2248 0.02 M.\n\nSo plugging into the K expression:\n\nK = [Ca-EDTA] / ( [Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-] )\n\nBut [Ca\u00b2+] = [EDTA^4-] = x, so:\n\n5e10 = (0.02) / (x^2)\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) \n\nx^2 = 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 \n\nSo 2 divided by 5 is 0.4, so 0.4e-12.
