The key here is to first figure out what compound X is, then see what reaction occurs when it's treated with red P and HI.\n\nSo first, let's analyze the data given for compound X. Let's look at the IR and NMR spectra.\n\nStarting with the IR spectrum. The peaks given are 3400-2500, 1720, 1610, 1450 cm\u207b\u00b9. The broad peak between 3400-2500 is characteristic of an O-H stretch, which suggests that the compound has an alcohol or a carboxylic acid group. The 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 peak is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group (C=O), which could be part of a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Since there's an O-H, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid (since the OH of a carboxylic acid would be around 3000-2500 cm-1, but more specifically around 2500-3300 but with a broad peak). The 1610 and 1450 cm\u207b\u00b9 peaks are likely aromatic C-C stretching vibrations. The 1610 is the aromatic ring stretching, and 1450 might be a deformation or another ring vibration, but the presence of both suggests an aromatic compound. So putting that together, the compound likely has an aromatic ring, a carboxylic acid group (since the O-H is present), and a carbonyl group.",

The key is to first figure out what compound X is based on the IR and NMR data, then see what reaction with red P and HI would produce.\n\nSo let's analyze the data first. \n\nStarting with the IR spectrum. The IR has peaks at 3400-2500 cm-1. That broad peak between 3400 and 2500 is characteristic of an alcohol or carboxylic acid O-H stretch. Since it's a broad peak, maybe it's a carboxylic acid because the O-H stretch for carboxylic acids is around 2500-3300, and they are broad because of hydrogen bonding. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is typical of a carbonyl group (C=O), like in a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Since we already have the O-H, maybe it's a carboxylic acid (since carboxylic acids have both O-H and C=O). Then the 1610 cm-1 is likely the C=C stretch from an aromatic ring. The 1450 might be another aromatic peak or maybe an alkene, but in the presence of aromatic, probably part of the aromatic ring's skeletal vibrations.\n\nSo putting that together, IR suggests a carboxylic acid (because of the broad O-H and the C=O at 1720), and an aromatic ring (1610 cm-1). So compound X is probably an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\nNow the NMR data. Let's look at the 1H NMR. The 10.5 ppm signal is a broad singlet, which is probably the carboxylic acid proton. Then the 8.0 and 7.2 ppm signals are aromatic protons. The 8.0 ppm is a doublet (d) for 2H and 7.2 is a doublet for 2H. Hmm, so maybe it's a disubstituted benzene with two sets of protons each as doublets. The positions would suggest that maybe there are groups on the benzene ring. Let me think: if the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, perhaps they are para to each other? Like, if there's a substituent on the para position, maybe an alkyl group? Let me see: the chemical shifts for aromatic protons can be influenced by the substituents. A carboxylic acid is already on the ring, so maybe the benzene ring has the -COOH group and another substituent. \n\nLooking at the other peaks: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), 0.9 (t, 3H). The 0.9 ppm triplet is likely a methyl group (like CH3CH2...), and that's the end of a chain. The 1.4 ppm doublet (d for 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH (since a methyl adjacent to a CH2 would give a quartet, but a CH3 attached to a CH might be a doublet from coupling with one proton). The 2.9 ppm multiplet is maybe a methylene adjacent to a branch point. The 1.7 ppm multiplet might be another methylene. \n\nPutting that together, the structure of the alkyl chain. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the methyl at 0.9 ppm (t), that's probably a CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm is a methyl (d, 3H) which is the isopropyl methyl?",

The 1610 is the aromatic ring stretching, and 1450 might be a deformation or another ring vibration, but the presence of both suggests an aromatic compound.

The IR has peaks at 3400-2500 cm-1. That broad peak between 3400 and 2500 is characteristic of an alcohol or carboxylic acid O-H stretch. Since it's a broad peak, maybe it's a carboxylic acid because the O-H stretch for carboxylic acids is around 2500-3300, and they are broad because of hydrogen bonding. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is typical of a carbonyl group (C=O), like in a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Since we already have the O-H, maybe it's a carboxylic acid (since carboxylic acids have both O-H and C=O). Then the 1610 cm-1 is likely the C=C stretch from an aromatic ring. The 1450 might be another aromatic peak or maybe an alkene, but in the presence of aromatic, probably part of the aromatic ring's skeletal vibrations.\n\nSo putting that together, IR suggests a carboxylic acid (because of the broad O-H and the C=O at 1720), and an aromatic ring (1610 cm-1). So compound X is probably an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\nNow the NMR data. Let's look at the 1H NMR. The 10.5 ppm signal is a broad singlet, which is probably the carboxylic acid proton. Then the 8.0 and 7.2 ppm signals are aromatic protons. The 8.0 ppm is a doublet (d) for 2H and 7.2 is a doublet for 2H. Hmm, so maybe it's a disubstituted benzene with two sets of protons each as doublets. The positions would suggest that maybe there are groups on the benzene ring. Let me think: if the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, perhaps they are para to each other? Like, if there's a substituent on the para position, maybe an alkyl group? Let me see: the chemical shifts for aromatic protons can be influenced by the substituents.
