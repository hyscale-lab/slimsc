Let's track each component.\n\nFirst, the first tube (Mg(ClO4)2) increases by 3.60g. Let's suppose that this tube is absorbing a specific gas, let's say H2O or another. The second tube didn't change, so CO2 isn't present. The third tube gains 0.80g from forming CuO, which would be oxygen. Let's think about possible gases.\n\nThe salts A and B, when heated, might produce gases like NH3, SO2, CO2, H2O, HCl, etc. But since the second tube (which would absorb CO2) didn't change, there's no CO2. Maybe the CO2 was absorbed in the first tube.",
