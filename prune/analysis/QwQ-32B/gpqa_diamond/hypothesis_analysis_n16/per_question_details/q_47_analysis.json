The CH2 next to the oxygen would be a methylene (CH2), so the protons on that CH2 would couple with the three protons of the CH3 next to them. So the CH2 would be a quartet at around 4.2-4.5 ppm. The CH3 would be a triplet at around 1.2-1.3 ppm. So that matches the 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H). So that's consistent with an ethyl ester group.\n\nThen the other peaks. The 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) is a broad singlet. Broad signals in NMR usually indicate exchangeable protons, like -OH or -NH groups. Since the molecular formula has N and O, but the IR has N-H, so that's probably an amine group (NH2) giving two protons. The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm would be the NH2 group. But amines can sometimes be a bit upfield, but maybe here it's around 4 ppm. \n\nLooking at the aromatic peaks: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Aromatic protons usually between 6.5-8.5 ppm. The two doublets suggest two pairs of protons. The 7.0 and 8.0 ppm could be from a para-disubstituted benzene. Let's see: if the benzene ring has two substituents on opposite sides (para), then the adjacent protons would have a certain splitting.",
