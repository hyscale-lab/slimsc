The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is measured in velocity, but the Doppler shift in wavelength is related to K via the formula:\n\n\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb = v / c \n\nWhere v is the velocity, c is the speed of light, and \u0394\u03bb is the shift. \n\nSo the shift in wavelength \u0394\u03bb is related to the velocity K by:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = (K * \u03bb ) / c \n\nTherefore, the given shifts (0.03 \u00c5 and 0.04 \u00c5) can be converted to velocities by rearranging:\n\nK = (\u0394\u03bb * c) / \u03bb \n\nTherefore, K1 = (0.03 \u00c5 * c ) / 6300 \u00c5 \n\nSimilarly, K2 = (0.04 \u00c5 * c ) / 6300 \u00c5 \n\nThe c and \u03bb will cancel out when taking the ratio K1/K2, so:\n\nK1/K2 = (0.03 / 6300) / (0.04 / 6300 ) = 0.03 /0.04 = 3/4 = 0.75 \n\nSo K1/K2 = 0.75 \n\nTherefore, (K1/K2)^2 = (0.75)^2 = 0.5625 \n\nNow, plug into the equation above for a2/a1:\n\na2/a1 = ( (K2/K1)^2 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )",

The question says \"Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth.\" So the masses are correct. \n\nThe K values are given as up to 0.03 and 0.04 in angstroms, so the velocities are as I calculated. \n\nHmm, perhaps the question is using the semi-amplitude as the full shift, like K is the full shift, not the semi-amplitude?",

These shifts are the Doppler shifts due to the planet's gravitational pull on the star, so the amplitude of the star's velocity is related to the shift.\n\nThe Doppler shift formula is \u0394\u03bb / \u03bb = v / c, where v is the velocity of the star towards or away from us. The shift given is up to 0.03 \u00c5 for Planet1 and 0.04 \u00c5 for Planet2. The line is at 6300 \u00c5, so the velocity semi-amplitude (K) would be (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb) * c. Since the maximum shift is given, that's the K value (semi-amplitude). \n\nSo K1 = (0.03 \u00c5 / 6300 \u00c5) * c, and similarly K2 = (0.04 / 6300)*c. \n\nBut the velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass, the orbital period, and the inclination of the orbit. However, since we can't know the inclination, but the transit method requires the orbit to be edge-on (so sin i =1), so for the planets detected via both transit and RV, their inclinations are edge-on. So in that case, we can relate K to the actual velocity. \n\nThe formula for K (radial velocity semi-amplitude) is:\n\nK = (G (M_p) / (4\u03c0\u00b2) )^(1/3) * ( (2\u03c0/G(M_star + M_p))^(2/3) )^(1/3) ) * (1/sin i) ) ?",

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is measured in velocity, but the Doppler shift in wavelength is related to K via the formula:\n\n\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb = v / c \n\nWhere v is the velocity, c is the speed of light, and \u0394\u03bb is the shift. \n\nSo the shift in wavelength \u0394\u03bb is related to the velocity K by:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = (K * \u03bb ) / c \n\nTherefore, the given shifts (0.03 \u00c5 and 0.04 \u00c5) can be converted to velocities by rearranging:\n\nK = (\u0394\u03bb * c) / \u03bb \n\nTherefore, K1 = (0.03 \u00c5 * c ) / 6300 \u00c5 \n\nSimilarly, K2 = (0.04 \u00c5 * c ) / 6300 \u00c5 \n\nThe c and \u03bb will cancel out when taking the ratio K1/K2, so:\n\nK1/K2 = (0.03 / 6300) / (0.04 / 6300 ) = 0.03 /0.04 = 3/4 = 0.75 \n\nSo K1/K2 = 0.75 \n\nTherefore, (K1/K2)^2 = (0.75)^2 = 0.5625 \n\nNow, plug into the equation above for a2/a1:\n\na2/a1 = ( (K2/K1)^2 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )",

The Doppler shift in wavelength \u0394\u03bb is given by \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = v/c, where v is the velocity, so the velocity semi-amplitude K is (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb) * c. \n\nAh, right. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the observed Doppler shift.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is measured in velocity, but the Doppler shift in wavelength is related to K via the formula:\n\n\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb = v / c \n\nWhere v is the velocity, c is the speed of light, and \u0394\u03bb is the shift. \n\nSo the shift in wavelength \u0394\u03bb is related to the velocity K by:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = (K * \u03bb ) / c \n\nTherefore, the given shifts (0.03 \u00c5 and 0.04 \u00c5) can be converted to velocities by rearranging:\n\nK = (\u0394\u03bb * c) / \u03bb \n\nTherefore, K1 = (0.03 \u00c5 * c ) / 6300 \u00c5 \n\nSimilarly, K2 = (0.04 \u00c5 * c ) / 6300 \u00c5 \n\nThe c and \u03bb will cancel out when taking the ratio K1/K2, so:\n\nK1/K2 = (0.03 / 6300) / (0.04 / 6300 ) = 0.03 /0.04 = 3/4 = 0.75 \n\nSo K1/K2 = 0.75 \n\nTherefore, (K1/K2)^2 = (0.75)^2 = 0.5625 \n\nNow, plug into the equation above for a2/a1:\n\na2/a1 = ( (K2/K1)^2 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )",

Let me write K2 = (4/3) K1. \n\nSo substituting K2 = (4/3) K1 into the equation:\n\n(a2/a1) = [ ( M_p2 / ( (4/3 K1)^2 ) ) / ( M_p1 / K1^2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nLet me compute numerator and denominator inside the brackets:\n\nNumerator: M_p2 / ( (16/9) K1\u00b2 ) \n\nDenominator: M_p1 / K1\u00b2 \n\nSo the ratio is (M_p2 / (16/9 K1\u00b2 )) divided by ( M_p1 / K1\u00b2 ) ) \n\nWhich simplifies to ( M_p2 / (16/9 K1\u00b2 ) ) * ( K1\u00b2 / M_p1 ) ) \n\nThe K1\u00b2 terms cancel, so we get ( M_p2 / (16/9) ) / M_p1 \n\nWhich is ( (9/16) M_p2 ) / M_p1 \n\nTherefore, the entire expression inside the brackets is (9/16)*(5/7) \u2192 since M_p2 is 5 and M_p1 is 7.",

The shift \u0394\u03bb is given, but the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to \u0394\u03bb via the Doppler formula. \n\nOh!

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is measured in velocity, but the Doppler shift in wavelength is related to K via the formula:\n\n\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb = v / c \n\nWhere v is the velocity, c is the speed of light, and \u0394\u03bb is the shift. \n\nSo the shift in wavelength \u0394\u03bb is related to the velocity K by:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = (K * \u03bb ) / c \n\nTherefore, the given shifts (0.03 \u00c5 and 0.04 \u00c5) can be converted to velocities by rearranging:\n\nK = (\u0394\u03bb * c) / \u03bb \n\nTherefore, K1 = (0.03 \u00c5 * c ) / 6300 \u00c5 \n\nSimilarly, K2 = (0.04 \u00c5 * c ) / 6300 \u00c5 \n\nThe c and \u03bb will cancel out when taking the ratio K1/K2, so:\n\nK1/K2 = (0.03 / 6300) / (0.04 / 6300 ) = 0.03 /0.04 = 3/4 = 0.75 \n\nSo K1/K2 = 0.75 \n\nTherefore, (K1/K2)^2 = (0.75)^2 = 0.5625 \n\nNow, plug into the equation above for a2/a1:\n\na2/a1 = ( (K2/K1)^2 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )",

Let me see the question again.\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. The equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the distance, and the albedo. Since both have same albedo, and same star, so the ratio Teq1/Teq2= sqrt( a2/a1 ) ), as I derived earlier. So I need to find a1/a2, then take the square root inverted. \n\nSo how do I find a1/a2?\n\nThe key is to relate the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K) to the orbital distances. Let's recall that K is proportional to (M_p / (M_star) )^{1/3} * (1 / sqrt( a )) )?",

So the R_star terms cancel, the 2's cancel, so sqrt(1/a1 / 1/a2) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ). So the ratio is sqrt(a2/a1). Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is the square root of (a2 divided by a1). \n\nSo, we need to find the ratio a2/a1, then take the square root. \n\nNow, how do we find the orbital distances a1 and a2 of each planet? Since the problem gives information about the radial velocity shifts induced by each planet. The radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift caused by the planet's gravitational pull on the star. \n\nThe formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K (in velocity units) induced by a planet is given by:\n\nK = (G (M_p / sin i) ) / ( (M_s + M_p)^{1/3} a )^{2/3} )^{1/3} ...",

          "text1": "Wait, hold on. The problem mentions that Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5, while Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 \u00c5. \n\nAh, here's a key point. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is measured in velocity, but the Doppler shift in wavelength is related to K via the formula:\n\n\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb = v / c \n\nWhere v is the velocity, c is the speed of light, and \u0394\u03bb is the shift. \n\nSo the shift in wavelength \u0394\u03bb is related to the velocity K by:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = (K * \u03bb ) / c \n\nTherefore, the given shifts (0.03 \u00c5 and 0.04 \u00c5) can be converted to velocities by rearranging:\n\nK = (\u0394\u03bb * c) / \u03bb \n\nTherefore, K1 = (0.03 \u00c5 * c ) / 6300 \u00c5 \n\nSimilarly, K2 = (0.04 \u00c5 * c ) / 6300 \u00c5 \n\nThe c and \u03bb will cancel out when taking the ratio K1/K2, so:\n\nK1/K2 = (0.03 / 6300) / (0.04 / 6300 ) = 0.03 /0.04 = 3/4 = 0.75 \n\nSo K1/K2 = 0.75 \n\nTherefore, (K1/K2)^2 = (0.75)^2 = 0.5625 \n\nNow, plug into the equation above for a2/a1:\n\na2/a1 = ( (K2/K1)^2 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )",
          "text2": "Wait, the Doppler shift is the velocity, so K is the velocity semi-amplitude. The units here might be in \u00c5ngstr\u00f6ms, but the actual velocity would depend on the wavelength. Oh, the problem mentions the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5. The Doppler shift in wavelength \u0394\u03bb is given by \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = v/c, where v is the velocity, so the velocity semi-amplitude K is (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb) * c. \n\nAh, right. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the observed Doppler shift. The formula is \u0394\u03bb = (v/c) * \u03bb, so v = (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb) * c. \n\nSo for each planet, the K (velocity) is (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb ) * c. \n\nThe problem states that Planet1 induces a shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5, and Planet2 0.04 \u00c5. The wavelength \u03bb for the [OI] line is 6300 \u00c5. \n\nTherefore, the velocity semi-amplitudes K1 and K2 can be calculated as:\n\nK1 = (0.03 \u00c5 / 6300 \u00c5 ) * c \n\nK2 = (0.04 / 6300 ) * c \n\nSince the ratio K1/K2 would be 0.03/0.04 = 0.75, so K1 = 0.75 K2. \n\nTherefore, when calculating the ratio a2/a1, let's proceed step by step. \n\nLet me first compute the ratio a2/a1. \n\nEarlier, we had:\n\na \u221d ( M_p / (K\u00b2) )^(1/3 )\n\nSo (a2/a1) = [ ( M_p2 / K2\u00b2 ) / ( M_p1 / K1\u00b2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nM_p1 = 7 Earth masses, M_p2 =5 Earth masses. \n\nK1/K2 = 0.03/0.04 = 0.75 \u2192 K1 = 0.75 K2 \u2192 K2 = (4/3) K1. Let me write K2 = (4/3) K1. \n\nSo substituting K2 = (4/3) K1 into the equation:\n\n(a2/a1) = [ ( M_p2 / ( (4/3 K1)^2 ) ) / ( M_p1 / K1^2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nLet me compute numerator and denominator inside the brackets:\n\nNumerator: M_p2 / ( (16/9) K1\u00b2 ) \n\nDenominator: M_p1 / K1\u00b2 \n\nSo the ratio is (M_p2 / (16/9 K1\u00b2 )) divided by ( M_p1 / K1\u00b2 ) ) \n\nWhich simplifies to ( M_p2 / (16/9 K1\u00b2 ) ) * ( K1\u00b2 / M_p1 ) ) \n\nThe K1\u00b2 terms cancel, so we get ( M_p2 / (16/9) ) / M_p1 \n\nWhich is ( (9/16) M_p2 ) / M_p1 \n\nTherefore, the entire expression inside the brackets is (9/16)*(5/7) \u2192 since M_p2 is 5 and M_p1 is 7.",
