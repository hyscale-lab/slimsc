          "text1": "Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. But how does the radius come into play here? Maybe the radius here refers to the parameter that defines the pseudosphere's size. Let me think. In standard terms, a pseudosphere can be parametrized using coordinates where the radius is the parameter. But here, perhaps the metric is given in terms of coordinates x and y, and the radius r=2 might correspond to the boundary of the region where the metric is defined?\n\nLooking at the denominator 4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2, the metric would become singular when the denominator is zero, so when x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 4. That's a circle of radius 2 in the xy-plane. So maybe the pseudosphere is parametrized in the region where x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 < 4, and the \"radius\" r=2 is referring to the boundary of this region. Therefore, the pseudosphere's area would be the integral over the disk of radius 2 in the (x,y) plane, using the given area element.\n\nSo the area A would be the double integral over x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 \u2264 4 of [32/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)] dx dy. Let me write that down:\n\nA = \u222b\u222b_{D} [32 / (4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)] dx dy, where D is the disk x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 \u22644.\n\nHmm, integrating this. Since the integrand is radially symmetric (depends only on r = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)), it's best to switch to polar coordinates. Let me do that. Let x = r cos\u03b8, y = r sin\u03b8. Then x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = r\u00b2, and dx dy becomes r dr d\u03b8. The limits for r would be from 0 to 2 (since radius 2), and \u03b8 from 0 to 2\u03c0. \n\nSubstituting into the integral:\n\nA = \u222b\u2080^{2\u03c0} \u222b\u2080\u00b2 [32 / (4 - r\u00b2)] * r dr d\u03b8.\n\nFirst integrate over \u03b8. The integrand doesn't depend on \u03b8, so integrating over \u03b8 just multiplies by 2\u03c0. Thus,\n\nA = 32 * 2\u03c0 \u222b\u2080\u00b2 [r / (4 - r\u00b2)] dr.\n\nSimplify constants: 32 * 2\u03c0 = 64\u03c0. So,\n\nA = 64\u03c0 \u222b\u2080\u00b2 [r / (4 - r\u00b2)] dr.\n\nNow compute the integral \u222b [r/(4 - r\u00b2)] dr. Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r\u00b2, then du/dr = -2r \u2192 - (du)/2 = r dr. \n\nChanging limits: when r=0, u =4; when r=2, u=0. \n\nSo the integral becomes:\n\n\u222b_{u=4}^{u=0} [ 1/u ] * (-du/2) \n\n= (1/2) \u222b\u2080\u2074 (1/u) du \n\n= (1/2) [ln u] from 0 to4",

Because the denominator in the metric is (4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2), which would approach zero when x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 approaches 4. That makes sense because maybe the radius 2 is the boundary where the metric becomes singular? So the pseudosphere would be the disk where x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 < 4, but since it's a surface, perhaps we're integrating over that disk to find the area.\n\nSo the area should be the double integral over the disk x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 \u2264 (2)^2 (since radius is 2) of the area element.

Hmm, but the question says pseudosphere of radius r=2. Maybe the metric is parametrizing the pseudosphere with some radius, so the radius here might be related to the parameter in the metric. Let me check the metric again.\n\nLooking at the metric's denominator, 4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2. So when x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, so the metric blows up. That suggests that the coordinates are valid within a circle of radius 2 (since 4 is (2)^2). So the region is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 < 4, which is a disk of radius 2 in the (x,y) plane.

Let me set x = r cos\u03b8, y = r sin\u03b8. Then x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = r\u00b2, so the denominator becomes (4 - r\u00b2). The area element in polar coordinates is r dr d\u03b8.

The integrand doesn't depend on \u03b8, so integrating over \u03b8 from 0 to 2\u03c0 just multiplies the radial integral by 2\u03c0.

So the integral becomes \u222b from u=4 to 0 of (1/u) * (-du/2) \u2192 flipping the limits, that's (1/2) \u222b0^4 (1/u) du. The integral of 1/u is ln|u|, so (1/2)(ln u from 0 to4 ).",

          "text1": "Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. But how does the radius come into play here? Maybe the radius here refers to the parameter that defines the pseudosphere's size. Let me think. In standard terms, a pseudosphere can be parametrized using coordinates where the radius is the parameter. But here, perhaps the metric is given in terms of coordinates x and y, and the radius r=2 might correspond to the boundary of the region where the metric is defined?\n\nLooking at the denominator 4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2, the metric would become singular when the denominator is zero, so when x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 4. That's a circle of radius 2 in the xy-plane. So maybe the pseudosphere is parametrized in the region where x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 < 4, and the \"radius\" r=2 is referring to the boundary of this region. Therefore, the pseudosphere's area would be the integral over the disk of radius 2 in the (x,y) plane, using the given area element.\n\nSo the area A would be the double integral over x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 \u2264 4 of [32/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)] dx dy. Let me write that down:\n\nA = \u222b\u222b_{D} [32 / (4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)] dx dy, where D is the disk x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 \u22644.\n\nHmm, integrating this. Since the integrand is radially symmetric (depends only on r = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)), it's best to switch to polar coordinates. Let me do that. Let x = r cos\u03b8, y = r sin\u03b8. Then x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = r\u00b2, and dx dy becomes r dr d\u03b8. The limits for r would be from 0 to 2 (since radius 2), and \u03b8 from 0 to 2\u03c0. \n\nSubstituting into the integral:\n\nA = \u222b\u2080^{2\u03c0} \u222b\u2080\u00b2 [32 / (4 - r\u00b2)] * r dr d\u03b8.\n\nFirst integrate over \u03b8. The integrand doesn't depend on \u03b8, so integrating over \u03b8 just multiplies by 2\u03c0. Thus,\n\nA = 32 * 2\u03c0 \u222b\u2080\u00b2 [r / (4 - r\u00b2)] dr.\n\nSimplify constants: 32 * 2\u03c0 = 64\u03c0. So,\n\nA = 64\u03c0 \u222b\u2080\u00b2 [r / (4 - r\u00b2)] dr.\n\nNow compute the integral \u222b [r/(4 - r\u00b2)] dr. Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r\u00b2, then du/dr = -2r \u2192 - (du)/2 = r dr. \n\nChanging limits: when r=0, u =4; when r=2, u=0. \n\nSo the integral becomes:\n\n\u222b_{u=4}^{u=0} [ 1/u ] * (-du/2) \n\n= (1/2) \u222b\u2080\u2074 (1/u) du \n\n= (1/2) [ln u] from 0 to4",

So the pseudosphere would be the disk where x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 < 4, but since it's a surface, perhaps we're integrating over that disk to find the area.\n\nSo the area should be the double integral over the disk x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 \u2264 (2)^2 (since radius is 2) of the area element.

Hmm, but the question says pseudosphere of radius r=2. Maybe the metric is parametrizing the pseudosphere with some radius, so the radius here might be related to the parameter in the metric. Let me check the metric again.\n\nLooking at the metric's denominator, 4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2. So when x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, so the metric blows up. That suggests that the coordinates are valid within a circle of radius 2 (since 4 is (2)^2). So the region is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 < 4, which is a disk of radius 2 in the (x,y) plane.

The integrand doesn't depend on \u03b8, so integrating over \u03b8 from 0 to 2\u03c0 just multiplies the radial integral by 2\u03c0. So the total area is 32 * 2\u03c0 \u222b (0 to 2) [r / (4 - r\u00b2)] dr.\n\nNow compute the radial integral \u222b0^2 [r/(4 - r\u00b2)] dr. Let me do substitution.

So the integral becomes \u222b from u=4 to 0 of (1/u) * (-du/2) \u2192 flipping the limits, that's (1/2) \u222b0^4 (1/u) du. The integral of 1/u is ln|u|, so (1/2)(ln u from 0 to4 ).",

In standard terms, a pseudosphere can be parametrized using coordinates where the radius is the parameter. But here, perhaps the metric is given in terms of coordinates x and y, and the radius r=2 might correspond to the boundary of the region where the metric is defined?\n\nLooking at the denominator 4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2, the metric would become singular when the denominator is zero, so when x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 4. That's a circle of radius 2 in the xy-plane. So maybe the pseudosphere is parametrized in the region where x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 < 4, and the \"radius\" r=2 is referring to the boundary of this region. Therefore, the pseudosphere's area would be the integral over the disk of radius 2 in the (x,y) plane, using the given area element.\n\nSo the area A would be the double integral over x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 \u2264 4 of [32/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)] dx dy.

Since the integrand is radially symmetric (depends only on r = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)), it's best to switch to polar coordinates. Let me do that. Let x = r cos\u03b8, y = r sin\u03b8. Then x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = r\u00b2, and dx dy becomes r dr d\u03b8. The limits for r would be from 0 to 2 (since radius 2), and \u03b8 from 0 to 2\u03c0. \n\nSubstituting into the integral:\n\nA = \u222b\u2080^{2\u03c0} \u222b\u2080\u00b2 [32 / (4 - r\u00b2)] * r dr d\u03b8.\n\nFirst integrate over \u03b8. The integrand doesn't depend on \u03b8, so integrating over \u03b8 just multiplies by 2\u03c0. Thus,\n\nA = 32 * 2\u03c0 \u222b\u2080\u00b2 [r / (4 - r\u00b2)] dr.\n\nSimplify constants: 32 * 2\u03c0 = 64\u03c0. So,\n\nA = 64\u03c0 \u222b\u2080\u00b2 [r / (4 - r\u00b2)] dr.\n\nNow compute the integral \u222b [r/(4 - r\u00b2)] dr. Let me make a substitution.

But here, perhaps the metric is given in terms of coordinates x and y, and the radius r=2 might correspond to the boundary of the region where the metric is defined?\n\nLooking at the denominator 4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2, the metric would become singular when the denominator is zero, so when x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 4. That's a circle of radius 2 in the xy-plane. So maybe the pseudosphere is parametrized in the region where x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 < 4, and the \"radius\" r=2 is referring to the boundary of this region. Therefore, the pseudosphere's area would be the integral over the disk of radius 2 in the (x,y) plane, using the given area element.\n\nSo the area A would be the double integral over x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 \u2264 4 of [32/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)] dx dy. Let me write that down:\n\nA = \u222b\u222b_{D} [32 / (4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)] dx dy, where D is the disk x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 \u22644.\n\nHmm, integrating this. Since the integrand is radially symmetric (depends only on r = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)), it's best to switch to polar coordinates. Let me do that. Let x = r cos\u03b8, y = r sin\u03b8. Then x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = r\u00b2, and dx dy becomes r dr d\u03b8. The limits for r would be from 0 to 2 (since radius 2), and \u03b8 from 0 to 2\u03c0. \n\nSubstituting into the integral:\n\nA = \u222b\u2080^{2\u03c0} \u222b\u2080\u00b2 [32 / (4 - r\u00b2)] * r dr d\u03b8.\n\nFirst integrate over \u03b8. The integrand doesn't depend on \u03b8, so integrating over \u03b8 just multiplies by 2\u03c0. Thus,\n\nA = 32 * 2\u03c0 \u222b\u2080\u00b2 [r / (4 - r\u00b2)] dr.\n\nSimplify constants: 32 * 2\u03c0 = 64\u03c0. So,\n\nA = 64\u03c0 \u222b\u2080\u00b2 [r / (4 - r\u00b2)] dr.\n\nNow compute the integral \u222b [r/(4 - r\u00b2)] dr. Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r\u00b2, then du/dr = -2r \u2192 - (du)/2 = r dr. \n\nChanging limits: when r=0, u =4; when r=2, u=0. \n\nSo the integral becomes:\n\n\u222b_{u=4}^{u=0} [ 1/u ] * (-du/2) \n\n= (1/2) \u222b\u2080\u2074 (1/u) du \n\n= (1/2) [ln u] from 0 to4",
