Thus, product 3 would have two alcohol groups. \n\nNow, we need to determine the 1H NMR of product 3. The question asks about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding those exchanging with solvent, so not the OH protons). \n\nFirst, let's figure out the structure of product 3. Starting with product 1 (diketone), after forming a diene (product 2), ozonolysis would cleave the diene into two carbonyl groups, which are then reduced to alcohols. So product 3 would have two -OH groups where the double bonds were. \n\nThe most deshielded hydrogen would be the one closest to an electronegative group, like an oxygen. But in the structure of adamantane, the original positions of the ketones (product 1) would become sites of the diol in product 3. The hydrogens adjacent to the -OH groups would be deshielded.",
