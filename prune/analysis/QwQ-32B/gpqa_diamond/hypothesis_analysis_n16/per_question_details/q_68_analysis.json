The initial state was an eigenstate of S_z (since it was aligned with the original B field along Z), but the new Hamiltonian depends on S_y, so the state will start evolving according to the new Hamiltonian, leading to time dependence in the expectation values of other operators, like S_z.\n\nThe question is asking for the frequency of the oscillation of the average z-component of the moment. \n\nSo, let me recall time evolution in quantum mechanics. The state will evolve according to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with the new Hamiltonian. Let's consider the initial state is |+z\u27e9, the eigenstate of S_z with +1/2 (in units where \u0127 is 1, maybe? Well, the problem states the spin is 1/2, so the eigenvalues are \u00b1\u0127/2, but maybe in the equations we can set \u0127 to 1 for simplicity, since the frequency might depend on the ratio, which would cancel out the \u0127 terms.)\n\nFirst, let's write the Hamiltonian in terms of Pauli matrices.

So we need to find \u27e8S_z\u27e9 as a function of time after the field is changed to Y, and find its oscillation frequency.\n\nThe initial state was |\u2191\u27e9_z (the eigenstate of S_z with +\u0127/2). But when we switch to the Y field, the Hamiltonian is now H_final = -\u03b3 B S_y, so the time evolution of the system will be governed by this new Hamiltonian. \n\nThe system starts in a state that is an eigenstate of S_z, but not of S_y. Therefore, the expectation value of S_z will oscillate over time.

Let me note that \u03b3 here is the gyromagnetic ratio, so the units should be such that the Hamiltonian has units of energy. The standard form is H = -\u03b3 B \u00b7 S, so the energy eigenvalues would be -\u03b3 B times the eigenvalues of S\u00b7n, where n is the direction of the field. \n\nIn this case, after the switch, the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B S_y.

So H = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) \u03c3y. \n\nSo the Hamiltonian matrix (in units where \u0127=1, but let me see):\n\nIf we take \u0127 as part of the Hamiltonian, then H is:\n\nH = - (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) \u03c3y. \n\nThe time evolution operator is U(t) = e^{-i H t / \u0127} = e^{i (\u03b3 B / 2) \u03c3y t }.\n\nBecause substituting H into the exponent:\n\n- i H t / \u0127 = -i [ - (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) \u03c3y ] t / \u0127 = i (\u03b3 B / 2) \u03c3y t.\n\nSo U(t) = exp(i (\u03b3 B / 2) \u03c3y t )\n\nNow, we can expand this exponential. The Pauli matrices have the property that \u03c3y squared is the identity. So for any operator like \u03c3y multiplied by a scalar, the exponential can be expressed using trigonometric functions. \n\nThe general formula for exp(i \u03b8 \u03c3y) is cos(\u03b8) + i \u03c3y sin(\u03b8). Let me verify that:\n\nYes, because for a Pauli matrix, exp(i\u03b8 \u03c3y) = cos\u03b8 I + i sin\u03b8 \u03c3y. \n\nSo in this case, \u03b8 = (\u03b3 B / 2) t.\n\nTherefore, U(t) = cos( (\u03b3 B t / 2) ) I + i sin( (\u03b3 B t / 2) ) \u03c3y.\n\nNow, applying this to the initial state |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9. Let me represent |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9 as column vectors. In the standard basis:\n\n|+z\u27e9 is [1; 0], and |-z\u27e9 is [0; 1].\n\n\u03c3y is the matrix [0, -i; i, 0]. \n\nSo applying U(t) to |+z\u27e9:\n\nFirst, the identity part: cos(\u03b8) * |+z\u27e9 = cos( (\u03b3 B t/2 )) * [1;0].\n\nThe second term: i sin\u03b8 * \u03c3y |+z\u27e9.

Therefore, H = -\u03b3 B Sy = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) \u03c3y. \n\nThe Hamiltonian matrix in the Sz basis (using |+z> and |-z> as basis vectors) would be:\n\nH = - (\u03b3 B \u0127/2) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]\n\nThe eigenvalues of H can be found by solving the characteristic equation, but maybe I don't need to do that. Instead, since the system starts in |+z>, let's see how it evolves. \n\nThe time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / \u0127). Let's substitute H into that. \n\nH = - (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) \u03c3y, so H/\u0127 is - (\u03b3 B /2 ) \u03c3y.

Since S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2, the energy for |\u2191y\u27e9 is -\u03b3 B*(\u0127/2) and for |\u2193y\u27e9 is -\u03b3 B*(-\u0127/2) = + \u03b3 B \u0127/2.",

So the exponent is (\u03b3 B S_y t)/\u0127. \n\nSo the state becomes:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = e^{i \u03b3 B S_y t / \u0127 } [ (i |+y\u27e9 - i |-y\u27e9 ) / sqrt(2) ]\n\nSince S_y |\u00b1y\u27e9 = \u00b1 (\u0127/2) |\u00b1y\u27e9, the operator e^{i \u03b3 B S_y t / \u0127 } acts on |+y\u27e9 as multiplying by e^{i \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) t / \u0127 } = e^{i \u03b3 B t / 2 }, and similarly for |-y\u27e9 but with the opposite sign. \n\nTherefore:\n\ne^{i \u03b3 B S_y t / \u0127 } |+y\u27e9 = e^{i \u03b3 B (\u0127/2)/\u0127 t } |+y\u27e9 = e^{i \u03b3 B t / 2 } |+y\u27e9 \n\nSimilarly, e^{i \u03b3 B S_y t / \u0127 } |-y\u27e9 = e^{ -i \u03b3 B t / 2 } |-y\u27e9 \n\nPutting it all into the state:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = 1/sqrt(2) [ i e^{i \u03b3 B t/2 } |+y\u27e9 - i e^{ -i \u03b3 B t/2 } |-y\u27e9 ]\n\nNow, we need to compute the expectation value of S_z at time t. The magnetic moment's z-component is \u03bc_z = \u03b3 S_z, so the average \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 = \u03b3 \u27e8S_z\u27e9. \n\nSo first compute \u27e8\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.

The time evolution under H will cause the state to oscillate between these two states, but because H is proportional to Sy, the off-diagonal terms in the Sz basis will lead to transitions between |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9. \n\nThe key is to find the time dependence of \u27e8Sz\u27e9. Let's consider the time evolution. The initial state is |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9. The time evolution is given by |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = e^{-iHt/\u0127} |\u03c8(0)\u27e9. \n\nLet me compute H in matrix form. Let's set \u0127 to 1 for simplicity (since we can track the units, but maybe I'll keep it explicit). \n\nH = -\u03b3 B Sy. \n\nSy in terms of Pauli matrices is (\u0127/2) \u03c3y.

The Pauli matrices have the property that \u03c3y squared is the identity. So for any operator like \u03c3y multiplied by a scalar, the exponential can be expressed using trigonometric functions. \n\nThe general formula for exp(i \u03b8 \u03c3y) is cos(\u03b8) + i \u03c3y sin(\u03b8). Let me verify that:\n\nYes, because for a Pauli matrix, exp(i\u03b8 \u03c3y) = cos\u03b8 I + i sin\u03b8 \u03c3y. \n\nSo in this case, \u03b8 = (\u03b3 B / 2) t.\n\nTherefore, U(t) = cos( (\u03b3 B t / 2) ) I + i sin( (\u03b3 B t / 2) ) \u03c3y.\n\nNow, applying this to the initial state |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9.

So H = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) \u03c3y. \n\nSo the Hamiltonian matrix (in units where \u0127=1, but let me see):\n\nIf we take \u0127 as part of the Hamiltonian, then H is:\n\nH = - (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) \u03c3y. \n\nThe time evolution operator is U(t) = e^{-i H t / \u0127} = e^{i (\u03b3 B / 2) \u03c3y t }.\n\nBecause substituting H into the exponent:\n\n- i H t / \u0127 = -i [ - (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) \u03c3y ] t / \u0127 = i (\u03b3 B / 2) \u03c3y t.\n\nSo U(t) = exp(i (\u03b3 B / 2) \u03c3y t )\n\nNow, we can expand this exponential. The Pauli matrices have the property that \u03c3y squared is the identity. So for any operator like \u03c3y multiplied by a scalar, the exponential can be expressed using trigonometric functions. \n\nThe general formula for exp(i \u03b8 \u03c3y) is cos(\u03b8) + i \u03c3y sin(\u03b8). Let me verify that:\n\nYes, because for a Pauli matrix, exp(i\u03b8 \u03c3y) = cos\u03b8 I + i sin\u03b8 \u03c3y. \n\nSo in this case, \u03b8 = (\u03b3 B / 2) t.\n\nTherefore, U(t) = cos( (\u03b3 B t / 2) ) I + i sin( (\u03b3 B t / 2) ) \u03c3y.\n\nNow, applying this to the initial state |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9. Let me represent |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9 as column vectors. In the standard basis:\n\n|+z\u27e9 is [1; 0], and |-z\u27e9 is [0; 1].\n\n\u03c3y is the matrix [0, -i; i, 0]. \n\nSo applying U(t) to |+z\u27e9:\n\nFirst, the identity part: cos(\u03b8) * |+z\u27e9 = cos( (\u03b3 B t/2 )) * [1;0].\n\nThe second term: i sin\u03b8 * \u03c3y |+z\u27e9. Let's compute \u03c3y times |+z\u27e9:\n\n\u03c3y * [1;0] = [0; i*1], since the second component is i times the first component?",

Let me think. \n\nThe initial state is |+z\u27e9, the eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue +\u0127/2. When the magnetic field is turned to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -\u03bc\u00b7B_y = -\u03b3 B S_y.

So we need to find \u27e8S_z\u27e9 as a function of time and find its oscillation frequency. \n\nTo find \u27e8S_z\u27e9(t), we can express the time evolution in the basis of the new Hamiltonian. Since H is proportional to S_y, the eigenstates of S_y are the appropriate basis here. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9.

          "text1": "Wait, the problem says \"mu (= gamma*Sz)\", so maybe the entire magnetic moment is along the z-component. That would be strange unless the spin is aligned along z. But when the field is turned to Y, the interaction would involve the y-component of the magnetic moment. Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering that the magnetic moment's z-component is gamma Sz, but the total moment is still a vector. Maybe the question is only concerned with the z-component of the moment's time evolution even when the field is along Y.\n\nLet me re-read the question: \"The average of the z-component of the particle\u2019s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?\" So the problem is about how the expectation value of \u03bc_z evolves over time after the magnetic field is switched to Y. \n\nSo let's set up the problem more formally. Let's consider the initial state is |+z\u27e9, since the particle is aligned with the initial B field in the z-direction. Then, when we turn off the z-B field and turn on a Y-B field of the same magnitude, the new Hamiltonian will be H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. But \u03bc is the magnetic moment. Since \u03bc = \u03b3 S (the full vector), the Hamiltonian becomes H = -\u03b3 S\u00b7B. Since B is along Y, this becomes H = -\u03b3 S_y B. Because S\u00b7B would be S_y B in this case (since B is in Y direction).\n\nThe Hamiltonian in terms of operators can be written as H = -\u03b3 B S_y. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of S_y would be needed here. But since the initial state is |+z\u27e9, which is an eigenstate of S_z, not S_y, the system will start evolving according to the new Hamiltonian, leading to time dependence in the expectation values.\n\nThe question is about the oscillation frequency of \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9. Since \u03bc_z = \u03b3 S_z, the expectation value \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 is \u03b3 \u27e8S_z\u27e9. Therefore, we can focus on finding the time dependence of \u27e8S_z\u27e9 and then multiply by \u03b3 to get the frequency of the oscillation.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the oscillation frequency of \u27e8S_z\u27e9 when the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B S_y, starting from the initial state |+z\u27e9.\n\nTo solve this, let's recall that the time evolution of an operator in the Heisenberg picture, or using the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the state vector. Let me proceed with the Schr\u00f6dinger picture.\n\nThe initial state at time t=0 is |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9. The Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B S_y. Let's write the S_y operator in terms of Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices for spin-1/2 are:\n\nS_x = \u0127/2 \u03c3_x, S_y = \u0127/2 \u03c3_y, S_z = \u0127/2 \u03c3_z.\n\nBut since the constants might be absorbed into \u03b3, perhaps we can set \u0127=1 for simplicity here, since the frequency will involve \u03b3 B.",

The question is about the z-component of the magnetic moment's average, which starts oscillating. \n\nSince the particle was initially in the +Sz state. Let me recall that when the magnetic field direction changes, the basis states also change. The new basis is along Y. But the initial state is in the Z basis.

So the exponent becomes -i ( - (gamma B / 2 ) \u03c3y ) t = i (gamma B t / 2 ) \u03c3y.\n\nSo U(t) = exp( i (gamma B t / 2 ) \u03c3y )\n\nThe Pauli matrices have the property that \u03c3y squared is 1, so the exponential can be expanded as:\n\nexp(i \u03b8 \u03c3y ) = cos\u03b8 I + i \u03c3y sin\u03b8, where \u03b8 = (gamma B t / 2 )\n\nTherefore, U(t) = cos( gamma B t / 2 ) I + i \u03c3y sin( gamma B t / 2 )\n\nNow, the initial state is |\u2191z\u27e9 = [1; 0].\n\nLet me apply U(t) to this state.\n\nFirst, writing U(t) as:\n\nU(t) = [ cos(\u03b8)   i sin\u03b8 ]\n       [ i sin\u03b8    cos\u03b8 ]",

Instead, since the system starts in |+z>, let's see how it evolves. \n\nThe time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / \u0127). Let's substitute H into that. \n\nH = - (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) \u03c3y, so H/\u0127 is - (\u03b3 B /2 ) \u03c3y. Therefore, the exponent is -i * (-\u03b3 B /2 \u03c3y ) * t. \n\nSo U(t) = exp( i (\u03b3 B t / 2 ) \u03c3y )\n\nNow, the state at time t is |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = U(t) |+z\u27e9. \n\nWe can represent |+z\u27e9 as a column vector [1; 0]. \n\nLet me compute U(t) acting on this vector. \n\nFirst, \u03c3y is the Pauli Y matrix. The exponential of i times (\u03b3 B t / 2 ) \u03c3y. Hmm, exponentials of Pauli matrices can be expressed using Euler's formula for spin matrices. \n\nRecall that for any Pauli matrix \u03c3, exp(i \u03b8 \u03c3) = cos\u03b8 I + i sin\u03b8 \u03c3.",

But when the field is turned to Y, the interaction would involve the y-component of the magnetic moment. Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering that the magnetic moment's z-component is gamma Sz, but the total moment is still a vector. Maybe the question is only concerned with the z-component of the moment's time evolution even when the field is along Y.\n\nLet me re-read the question: \"The average of the z-component of the particle\u2019s moment starts oscillating.

Then, when we turn off the z-B field and turn on a Y-B field of the same magnitude, the new Hamiltonian will be H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. But \u03bc is the magnetic moment.

The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of S_y would be needed here. But since the initial state is |+z\u27e9, which is an eigenstate of S_z, not S_y, the system will start evolving according to the new Hamiltonian, leading to time dependence in the expectation values.\n\nThe question is about the oscillation frequency of \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9. Since \u03bc_z = \u03b3 S_z, the expectation value \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 is \u03b3 \u27e8S_z\u27e9. Therefore, we can focus on finding the time dependence of \u27e8S_z\u27e9 and then multiply by \u03b3 to get the frequency of the oscillation.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the oscillation frequency of \u27e8S_z\u27e9 when the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B S_y, starting from the initial state |+z\u27e9.\n\nTo solve this, let's recall that the time evolution of an operator in the Heisenberg picture, or using the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the state vector.
