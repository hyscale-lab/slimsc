But when substituting h=2\u03c0\u0127, that becomes (4 \u03c0\u00b2 \u0127\u00b2)/(8mL\u00b2) ) = (\u03c0\u00b2 \u0127\u00b2)/(2m L\u00b2 ). So yes, the problem's E is exactly the ground state energy of a single particle. So then for a single particle in the nth level, the energy is E_n = n\u00b2 E. Because E_n = n\u00b2*(E). That's the key. So for each particle, the energy is n squared times E. \n\nTherefore, when dealing with multiple particles, the total energy of the system would be the sum of the energies of each individual particle's quantum state, considering the Pauli exclusion principle. Since the particles are spin 1/2 fermions, each quantum state (defined by n and spin) can hold up to two particles. \n\nSo first, we need to fill the energy levels with four particles. Let's think of the possible quantum states.\n\nThe lowest energy levels for a single particle are n=1 (energy E), n=2 (4E), n=3 (9E), etc. But since each n can have two particles (spin up and down), the first energy level (n=1) can have two particles, the second (n=2) another two, and so on.",

So E_n = n\u00b2 E. \n\nSo for each particle, their energy is n squared times E. Since there are four particles, we need to assign them to the lowest possible energy states, considering their spin.
