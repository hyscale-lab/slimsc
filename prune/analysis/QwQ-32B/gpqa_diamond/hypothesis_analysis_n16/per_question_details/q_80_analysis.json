Maybe the values are positive integers, and the bases have values in a certain range.\n\nLooking for T and C to be positive:\n\nT can be from 1 to 30 (since 2T \u226461 \u2192 T \u226430).\n\nSuppose T and C are also positive integers. Let me pick a reasonable value for G. Let's say G is 30. Then A =115-60=55.\n\nThen T=20 (as before), C=21. \n\nSo the values would be:\n\nA=55, G=30, T=20, C=21.\n\nLet me see if this works for the second example:\n\nTGCTGA \u2192 T, G, C, T, G, A \u2192 their values are 20,30,21,20,30,55.\n\nSum:20+30+21+20+30+55 = 20+30 is50, +21 is71, +20=91, +30=121, +55=176.

          "text2": "Wait, the equations again. Let me think of possible integer values for the variables. Let me think of the first equation: a + 2g =115.

Now, I need to find possible values for t and c such that this holds. Since each base must have a positive integer value (probably), possible combinations could be, for instance, if t is 20, then c would be 61-40=21. But maybe other possibilities. Let's see:\n\nSuppose that each base is assigned a unique value. Let me think of possible assignments that fit. Let's see:\n\nIf A is 1, then G would be (115 -1)/2 = 57. So G=57. Then in the second equation, 2t +c =61. Let's say T is 20 and C is 21. Then 2*20 =40, plus 21=61. That works.
