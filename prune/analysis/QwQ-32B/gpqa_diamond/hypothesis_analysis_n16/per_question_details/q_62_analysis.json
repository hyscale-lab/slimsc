Maybe this option isn't the right one.\n\nBack to the target molecule. The target has an aldehyde group, so we need an oxidation step. The aldehyde is on one ring, and the other ring is connected via a CH(OH)CH2- group. Perhaps the synthesis involves forming a diol first, then oxidizing part of it to an aldehyde.\n\nLooking at the options again, option A's step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That sounds like an oxidation with mercuric sulfate (HgSO4) in acidic conditions (H2SO4) and water, which is the Oppenauer oxidation or maybe a different oxidation.",
