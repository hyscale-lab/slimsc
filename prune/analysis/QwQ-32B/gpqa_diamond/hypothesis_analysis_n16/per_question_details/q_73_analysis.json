Since they are moving in the same direction, their momenta are in the same direction. The total energy would be the sum of their individual total energies. But relativistic energy is gamma times mc\u00b2 for each. \n\nFirst astronaut's mass is 2m, moving at 0.6c. Gamma for that would be 1/sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)). So v is 0.6c, so v\u00b2/c\u00b2 is 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64, sqrt(0.64)=0.8, so gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25.

Now, moving on to the total energy part.\n\nTotal energy of the system. Since energy is additive in relativity, each astronaut's energy can be calculated using the relativistic energy formula E = \u03b3mc\u00b2, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. But the question mentions their masses are 2m and 3m. So I need to compute the energy for each and add them.\n\nFirst astronaut has mass 2m and speed 0.6c. \u03b3 for him is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Let's compute that:\n\nv = 0.6c, so v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So \u03b3 = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25. So his energy is 1.25 * 2m * c\u00b2 = 2.5 mc\u00b2.\n\nSecond astronaut has mass 3m and speed 0.5c. Compute \u03b3 for 0.5c: v\u00b2/c\u00b2 =0.25, so 1 - 0.25 =0.75. sqrt(0.75) is approx 0.8660.

          "text1": "Wait, maybe I need to use the formula for the velocity of one object as seen from the other's frame. \n\nLet me define the two astronauts as A (mass 2m, moving at 0.6c) and B (mass 3m, moving at 0.5c). Let's say we are in the lab frame, where both are moving along the x-axis. The question is about their relative speed. So from the perspective of astronaut A, what is astronaut B's speed? \n\nUsing the velocity transformation: if the lab frame is S, and astronaut A's frame is S', moving at v = 0.6c relative to S. In S', the speed of B would be calculated as follows. \n\nThe velocity of B in the lab frame is u = 0.5c. The velocity of S' (A's frame) is v = 0.6c relative to S. So the velocity u' of B in S' is given by:\n\nu' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c\u00b2)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nu = 0.5c, v = 0.6c,\n\nu' = (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c\u00b2 )\n\nCalculating numerator: ( -0.1c )\n\nDenominator: 1 - (0.3 c\u00b2)/c\u00b2 = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7\n\nSo u' = (-0.1c)/0.7 \u2248 -0.142857c. The negative sign indicates direction opposite to the motion of A's frame. So the magnitude is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. That matches option C and D for the relative speed. \n\nNow, moving on to the total energy of the system. The total energy for each astronaut would be their rest mass energy plus their kinetic energy. But since they are moving at relativistic speeds, we have to use the relativistic energy formula: E = gamma * m c\u00b2 for each. \n\nSo for astronaut A (mass 2m moving at 0.6c):\n\nGamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) \n\nv = 0.6c, so v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.36. \n\n1 - 0.36 = 0.64, sqrt(0.64) = 0.8. So gamma_A = 1/0.8 = 1.25. \n\nThus, E_A = 1.25 * 2m c\u00b2 = 2.5 m c\u00b2.\n\nFor astronaut B (mass 3m moving at 0.5c):\n\nGamma_B = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.25c\u00b2/c\u00b2)) = 1/sqrt(0.75). \n\nsqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.8660. So 1/0.866 \u2248 1.1547. \n\nSo E_B = 1.1547 * 3m c\u00b2 \u2248 3.464 m c\u00b2. \n\nAdding both energies: E_total = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c\u00b2. \n\nHmm, so that would be approximately 5.96 m c\u00b2.

          "text2": "Wait, actually, when calculating the relative velocity between two objects moving in the same direction, from the perspective of one of them, you use the formula for velocity addition. Let me recall the formula. The formula for the relative velocity v' between two objects moving at velocities u and v in the same direction is given by (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c\u00b2). Since both are moving in the same direction, the numerator would be 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c, but we have to divide by (1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/c\u00b2). Let me compute that denominator: (0.6 *0.5) c\u00b2 /c\u00b2 is 0.3, so 1 -0.3 = 0.7. So the relative velocity would be (0.1c)/0.7 \u2248 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. That seems to match option C or D. Let me check the options again. Option C says v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc^2, D has same v_rel but E=5mc^2. \n\nSo that would mean the first part of the answer is between C and D. Now onto the total energy part. The total energy of the system would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy is gamma times mass times c squared.

Let's compute gamma for each. \n\nFor the first astronaut: v = 0.6c. So v\u00b2/c\u00b2 is 0.36. Thus 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8, so gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. Therefore, their energy is gamma * mass * c\u00b2 = 1.25 * 2m * c\u00b2 = 2.5 m c\u00b2. \n\nSecond astronaut has mass 3m and speed 0.5c. v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.25, so 1-0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660... so gamma is 1/0.8660 \u2248 1.1547. Then their energy is 1.1547 * 3m * c\u00b2 \u2248 3.4641 m c\u00b2. \n\nAdding the two energies: 2.5 + 3.4641 \u2248 5.9641 m c\u00b2. So that rounds to approximately 5.96 mc\u00b2. \n\nLooking back at options, that matches option C. The relative speed was 0.14c and energy 5.96 mc\u00b2. So the answer should be C.",

Let's say we are in the lab frame, where both are moving along the x-axis. The question is about their relative speed. So from the perspective of astronaut A, what is astronaut B's speed? \n\nUsing the velocity transformation: if the lab frame is S, and astronaut A's frame is S', moving at v = 0.6c relative to S. In S', the speed of B would be calculated as follows. \n\nThe velocity of B in the lab frame is u = 0.5c. The velocity of S' (A's frame) is v = 0.6c relative to S.

The total energy for each astronaut would be their rest mass energy plus their kinetic energy. But since they are moving at relativistic speeds, we have to use the relativistic energy formula: E = gamma * m c\u00b2 for each. \n\nSo for astronaut A (mass 2m moving at 0.6c):\n\nGamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) \n\nv = 0.6c, so v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.36. \n\n1 - 0.36 = 0.64, sqrt(0.64) = 0.8.

Since both are moving in the same direction, the numerator would be 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c, but we have to divide by (1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/c\u00b2).

Let's compute gamma for each. \n\nFor the first astronaut: v = 0.6c. So v\u00b2/c\u00b2 is 0.36. Thus 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8, so gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. Therefore, their energy is gamma * mass * c\u00b2 = 1.25 * 2m * c\u00b2 = 2.5 m c\u00b2. \n\nSecond astronaut has mass 3m and speed 0.5c. v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.25, so 1-0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660... so gamma is 1/0.8660 \u2248 1.1547. Then their energy is 1.1547 * 3m * c\u00b2 \u2248 3.4641 m c\u00b2. \n\nAdding the two energies: 2.5 + 3.4641 \u2248 5.9641 m c\u00b2. So that rounds to approximately 5.96 mc\u00b2. \n\nLooking back at options, that matches option C. The relative speed was 0.14c and energy 5.96 mc\u00b2. So the answer should be C.",

Since both are moving in the same direction, the numerator would be 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c, but we have to divide by (1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/c\u00b2). Let me compute that denominator: (0.6 *0.5) c\u00b2 /c\u00b2 is 0.3, so 1 -0.3 = 0.7. So the relative velocity would be (0.1c)/0.7 \u2248 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c.
