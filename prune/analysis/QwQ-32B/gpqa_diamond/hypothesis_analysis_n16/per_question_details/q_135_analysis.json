Like, for example, if the boson decays into a pair of fermions, each of mass m, then 2m must be less than the boson's mass. Otherwise, the decay is forbidden. \n\nSo first, I need to figure out the masses of the possible fermions listed in the options.

Since the decay is into a fermion and its antiparticle, the total rest mass would be twice the mass of the fermion (since each has mass m_f). Therefore, 2m_f must be less than or equal to the mass of X (6 GeV). \n\nSo, for each possible fermion f, we need 2m_f \u2264 6 GeV.

So A is out.\n\nOption D also includes b\u0304b, so that would also be invalid. Hmm, so perhaps the correct answer can't be A or D. Let me check the other options.\n\nOption B includes c\u0304c. The charm quark mass is around 1.275 GeV. 2 * 1.275 is ~2.55 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So that's okay. \n\nOption C includes t\u0304t, which is way over, so they can't be formed.

Because in the center-of-mass frame, the two particles must each have at least m for their rest mass. Hence, the minimum energy each requires is m, so the total energy is 2m \u2264 M. \n\nTherefore, for each fermion pair f f\u0304, the mass of f must be less than M_X / 2 = 3 GeV. \n\nNow, I need to look at the masses of the listed particles in the options. Let me recall the approximate masses of the quarks and leptons:\n\nQuarks (in GeV):\n- u and d quarks: much less than 1 GeV (like ~0.005 GeV)\n- s quark: around 0.1 GeV (but maybe up to 0.2?)\n- c quark: about 1.3 GeV\n- b quark: ~4.2 GeV\n- t quark: ~173 GeV, which is way too big.\n\nLeptons:\n- electron: ~0.0005 GeV\n- muon: ~0.105 GeV\n- tau: ~1.777 GeV\n\nSo let's check each option's particles:\n\nOption A lists: b\u0304b, s\u0304s, u\u016b, d\u0304d, \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212, e+e\u2212.\n\nCheck each:\n\n- b quarks: mass ~4.2 GeV. So 2*4.2 = 8.4 GeV >6 GeV. So this decay is not allowed. So the presence of b\u0304b in option A would make it incorrect. So A can't be the right answer.\n\nOption B: c\u0304c, s\u0304s, u\u016b, d\u0304d, \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212, \u03bc+\u03bc\u2212, e+e\u2212.\n\nCheck c quark: 1.3 GeV. 2*1.3 =2.6 GeV <6 \u2192 allowed. So c\u0304c is okay. Tau is ~1.777 GeV. 2*1.777\u22483.55 GeV <6 \u2192 allowed. Muon is ~0.105 GeV, so okay. So all particles in B except maybe c are okay. So B is possible.\n\nOption C: includes t\u0304t. T quark is 173 GeV, way too big. So C is invalid.\n\nOption D: includes b\u0304b again (mass too high) and also \u03c4 and muons. So D's b decay is not allowed, so D is out.\n\nSo the options that have allowed decays would be B or D?",

For example, if A's mass is 6 GeV, then B + C's total rest mass must be \u22646 GeV. \n\nSo the key here is to look at all the possible fermion-antifermion pairs that X can decay into, and check whether their combined mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the masses of the quarks and leptons. Let me list them out:\n\nQuarks (in MeV units, roughly):\n\nUp quark (u): ~2-5 MeV\nDown quark (d): ~4-8 MeV\nStrange (s): ~95 MeV\nCharm (c): ~1.3 GeV (1300 MeV)\nBottom (b): ~4.2 GeV (4200 MeV)\nTop (t): ~173 GeV (way too heavy)\n\nLeptons:\n\nElectron (e): ~0.511 MeV\nMuon (\u03bc): ~105.7 MeV\nTau (\u03c4): ~1.777 GeV (1777 MeV)\n\nSo the X boson has a mass of 6 GeV. Let's look at each possible decay channel in the options.\n\nOption A: X \u2192 b\u0304b, s\u0304s, \u016bu, d\u0304d, \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212, e+e\u2212",

Hence, this decay is not allowed. Therefore, any option that includes b\u0304b is incorrect. So option A and D include b\u0304b, so they are out.",
