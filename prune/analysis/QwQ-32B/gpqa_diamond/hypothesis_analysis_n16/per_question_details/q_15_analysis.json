The probability is (R_star + a sin i)/a, but since i is random, the average over all inclinations would be 2/(\u03c0) * (R_star + R_planet)/a. But since R_planet is much smaller, we can approximate it as 2 R_star/(\u03c0 a). So the probability is proportional to R/(a). Since both stars have the same R, then the transit probability is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis a. \n\nTherefore, the planet with a smaller a (smaller orbital radius) would have a higher transit probability. \n\nNow, the problem states that Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, since the orbital period squared is proportional to a^3 divided by the star's mass (Kepler's third law). \n\nLet me write that out. For each planet, the orbital period squared is (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G M_star)) * a^3. \n\nSo, for Planet 1 and Planet 2, their periods are P1 and P2 = 3 P1.

So (1/3)^2 = (M2 / M1) * (a1/a2)^3 \n\nSince M1 is 2 M2, so M2/M1 = 1/2.\n\nSo: (1/9) = (1/2) * (a1/a2)^3 \n\nMultiply both sides by 2: (2)/9 = (a1/a2)^3 \n\nTake cube roots:\n\n(a1/a2) = (2/9)^(1/3) \n\nHmm. Let me compute that. 2/9 is approximately 0.2222. The cube root of that is... Let me see. Cube root of 0.216 (which is 0.6^3) is 0.6. Since 0.222 is a bit higher, so cube root would be a bit higher. Let's compute 0.2222^(1/3). Let me see, 0.6^3 is 0.216, so 0.2222 is 0.216 + 0.0062. So maybe approximately 0.6 + (0.0062)/(3*(0.6)^2). The derivative of x\u00b3 at x=0.6 is 3x\u00b2 = 3*(0.36)=1.08.

So a1/a2 \u2248 0.606. \n\nTherefore, a1 is about 0.606 times a2. \n\nSo since transit probability is proportional to R/a (since R is same), then the transit probability for Planet1 is (R/a1) and for Planet2 is (R/a2). Therefore, the ratio of their probabilities (P1_prob / P2_prob) is (a2/a1). Since a2/a1 \u22481/0.606 \u22481.65.",

Let me compute that. 2/9 is approximately 0.2222. The cube root of that is... Let me see. Cube root of 0.216 (which is 0.6^3) is 0.6. Since 0.222 is a bit higher, so cube root would be a bit higher. Let's compute 0.2222^(1/3). Let me see, 0.6^3 is 0.216, so 0.2222 is 0.216 + 0.0062. So maybe approximately 0.6 + (0.0062)/(3*(0.6)^2). The derivative of x\u00b3 at x=0.6 is 3x\u00b2 = 3*(0.36)=1.08. So delta x \u2248 delta (x\u00b3)/ (3x\u00b2) \u2192 delta x \u2248 (0.0062)/1.08 \u2248 ~0.0057. So total x \u22480.6057. So approximately 0.606. So a1/a2 \u2248 0.606. \n\nTherefore, a1 is about 0.606 times a2. \n\nSo since transit probability is proportional to R/a (since R is same), then the transit probability for Planet1 is (R/a1) and for Planet2 is (R/a2). Therefore, the ratio of their probabilities (P1_prob / P2_prob) is (a2/a1). Since a2/a1 \u22481/0.606 \u22481.65.",

So a1 is about 0.606 times a2. \n\nThus, the semi-major axis of Planet_1 is smaller than that of Planet_2. \n\nNow, the transit probability for each is proportional to R_star / a. Since both stars have the same radius (given in the problem: \"both host stars have the same radii\"), the transit probability ratio is (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = a2/a1. \n\nSo P_transit,1 / P_transit,2 = (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = a2/a1 = 1/(a1/a2) = 1/0.606 \u22481.65. \n\nTherefore, Planet_1's transit probability is about 1.65 times higher than Planet_2's. \n\nLooking at the options, that would correspond to option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability.",

          "text1": "Wait, let me think again. The transit occurs if the planet's orbital plane is oriented such that the impact parameter is less than the sum of the star and planet radii. The probability is (R_star + a sin i)/a, but since i is random, the average over all inclinations would be 2/(\u03c0) * (R_star + R_planet)/a. But since R_planet is much smaller, we can approximate it as 2 R_star/(\u03c0 a). So the probability is proportional to R/(a). Since both stars have the same R, then the transit probability is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis a. \n\nTherefore, the planet with a smaller a (smaller orbital radius) would have a higher transit probability. \n\nNow, the problem states that Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, since the orbital period squared is proportional to a^3 divided by the star's mass (Kepler's third law). \n\nLet me write that out. For each planet, the orbital period squared is (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G M_star)) * a^3. \n\nSo, for Planet 1 and Planet 2, their periods are P1 and P2 = 3 P1.

So (1/3)^2 = (M2 / M1) * (a1/a2)^3 \n\nSince M1 is 2 M2, so M2/M1 = 1/2.\n\nSo: (1/9) = (1/2) * (a1/a2)^3 \n\nMultiply both sides by 2: (2)/9 = (a1/a2)^3 \n\nTake cube roots:\n\n(a1/a2) = (2/9)^(1/3) \n\nHmm. Let me compute that. 2/9 is approximately 0.2222. The cube root of that is... Let me see. Cube root of 0.216 (which is 0.6^3) is 0.6. Since 0.222 is a bit higher, so cube root would be a bit higher. Let's compute 0.2222^(1/3). Let me see, 0.6^3 is 0.216, so 0.2222 is 0.216 + 0.0062. So maybe approximately 0.6 + (0.0062)/(3*(0.6)^2). The derivative of x\u00b3 at x=0.6 is 3x\u00b2 = 3*(0.36)=1.08.

So a1/a2 \u2248 0.606. \n\nTherefore, a1 is about 0.606 times a2. \n\nSo since transit probability is proportional to R/a (since R is same), then the transit probability for Planet1 is (R/a1) and for Planet2 is (R/a2). Therefore, the ratio of their probabilities (P1_prob / P2_prob) is (a2/a1). Since a2/a1 \u22481/0.606 \u22481.65.",

Let's compute 0.2222^(1/3). Let me see, 0.6^3 is 0.216, so 0.2222 is 0.216 + 0.0062. So maybe approximately 0.6 + (0.0062)/(3*(0.6)^2). The derivative of x\u00b3 at x=0.6 is 3x\u00b2 = 3*(0.36)=1.08.
