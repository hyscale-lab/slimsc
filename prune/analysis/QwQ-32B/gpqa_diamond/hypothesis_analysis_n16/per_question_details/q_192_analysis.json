That complicates things because the induced charges might not be symmetrically arranged.\n\nHmm, so maybe I need to think about the method of image charges or something? Or perhaps the superposition principle. Let me think again. The conductor is a spherical shell, and the cavity is inside it. The presence of the charge +q in the cavity will cause the electrons in the conductor to rearrange. The induced charge on the inner surface of the cavity will be -q, and the outer surface will have +q. But because the cavity is offset by s from the center, the induced charges on the inner surface won't be symmetrically distributed. However, the outer surface's total charge is still +q, but how does its distribution affect the field outside?",
