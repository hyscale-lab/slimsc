So, the number of stars is dN = n * 4\u03c0 d\u00b2 dd.\n\nBut we need to express this in terms of parallax p. Since p = 1/d, so d = 1/p. Then, dd = derivative of d with respect to p times dp. The derivative of d = 1/p with respect to p is -1/p\u00b2. So, dd = - (1/p\u00b2) dp. The negative sign indicates that as p increases, d decreases, which is correct. \n\nSubstituting into the expression for dN:\n\ndN = n * 4\u03c0 ( (1/p)^2 ) * ( -1/p\u00b2 dp )\n\nBut since we're considering the magnitude, we can drop the negative:\n\ndN/dp = n * 4\u03c0 (1/p^2) * (1/p\u00b2) ) = 4\u03c0 n / p^4.\n\nTherefore, dN/dp ~ 1/p^4, so the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to 1 over parallax to the fourth power. \n\nSo the correct answer should be option A) ~1/plx^4.",
