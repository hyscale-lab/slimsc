So this would measure cellular ATP levels. Since mitochondria are the main site of ATP production (through oxidative phosphorylation), measuring ATP could indicate mitochondrial function. So if the drug affects mitochondria, ATP levels might change. So this experiment is relevant.

Oh, because ATP is needed for the reaction. The light produced is proportional to the amount of ATP present. Because luciferase-luciferin reaction requires ATP. So if you add luciferin, the light emitted would indicate ATP levels. Since mitochondria generate ATP, this would measure ATP production, which is a mitochondrial function.
