The triphenylene core would have a threefold rotation axis through its center, and a horizontal mirror plane (since it's planar, the mirror plane would be the plane of the molecule itself).

The hexaone would be six ketone groups. If the substituents are placed symmetrically every 120 degrees, then the overall symmetry remains C3h. \n\nOn the other hand, option B's name starts with benzo, which is a benzene ring fused to the trifuran system.
