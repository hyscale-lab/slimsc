So T^4 is proportional to F, so T proportional to (F)^{1/4} = (L/(4\u03c0a\u00b2))^{1/4} * (1/(1 - albedo))^{1/4} (if albedo is factored in).

Since the orbits are circular and they are in orbital resonance, but the key here is Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (assuming same central mass). So P^2 \u221d a^3.

So maybe I can ignore the albedo here since it's the same for both. \n\nTherefore, the equilibrium temperature ratio squared (since T is proportional to (1/a)^0.5) would depend on the inverse square root of the semi-major axis ratio. But to find the ratio of T4 to T2, we need to know their distances from the star, which are related to their orbital periods via Kepler's third law. \n\nKepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So P^2 \u221d a^3. Since all the planets are orbiting the same star, the proportionality constant is the same, so (P1/P2)^2 = (a1/a2)^3.
